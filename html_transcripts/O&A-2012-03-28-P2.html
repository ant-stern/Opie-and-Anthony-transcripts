<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with the After Show hosted by Sam Roberts, featuring in-studio guests Eric and Chip.  The primary focus was Sam's upcoming stand-up performances at Caroline's Comedy Club and his upcoming Epix comedy special. He expressed anxieties about ticket sales and discussed his approach to incorporating commentary on Rick Santorum into his act without making it overly topical.

The conversation then shifted to Troy Quam, the show's DJ and producer, who had recently undergone rhinoplasty.  His post-operative experiences, including significant pain, breathing difficulties, sleeplessness, and substantial bleeding, were detailed. Opie and Anthony (and presumably Sam, Eric and Chip) mercilessly teased Troy about his pre-surgery glamour shots posted on Facebook, his perceived vanity, and his alleged jealousy of Pauly D's success.  Troy himself called in to the show and became the target of further ribbing.

Following this, the hosts engaged in raunchy discussion of Anthony Cumia's 35-hour date with news reporter Jill Nicolini, filled with speculation and off-color jokes.  The conversation also included vulgar comments about Octomom's appearance.

Logistical issues surrounding the Opie and Anthony staff's trip to Cleveland for a live show and Sam's comedy special taping were then addressed.  Specifically, Roland's apprehension about flying on a small plane and complications with per diem payments were discussed.

The main show then began with a nostalgic recounting of a past "amazing" and unique "experience" at the Short Hills location, possibly a live show.  The hosts reminisced about their collaborative effort on a version of "We Are the World," detailing the extensive recording process in the Fishbowl studio, which involved multiple takes and participants including Big A, Patty, and possibly Bobo. They described the resulting video as "fantastic" and encouraged listeners to find it online.  A brief tangent involved a discussion of a Sam Rivers podcast and a text message from Steve Storniolo correcting a statement about the song's authorship (Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie), leading to more playful banter.  The show concluded with a call to action for listeners to engage with their Facebook page, a reminder of the show's schedule, and a transition to the Ron and Fez show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  3 seconds.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah!  After Opie and Anthony Live, apparently,  because Norton missed two hours of the show,  they're making him make up that time.  Fucking Gary, I see him at the elevator,  and he says that they, I have to come back  for an hour and 17 minutes, not including commercials. 
[00:00:30]  Wow, so you're going to have to do the beginning of a round of Fez.  No, I have to break it up tomorrow and do a few minutes of this,  but it's an hour and 17 minutes, so it starts now.  So I don't even get the 10 o'clock.  Horrible.  Do you, uh, are you actually worried,  are you actually worried about tickets selling to Carolines?  Yes.  Really?  Yes.  Carolines are like, I thought that was a no-brainer.  No, you would think, right?  Saturday is sold out.  That's good.  Um, Friday and Thursday are good, and Sunday is good,  but they're not sold out. 
[00:01:00]  Um, I'm a fucking low-impact player in this business, Sam.  I do well when I haven't been somewhere in a while.  But when was, I guess because you did, like...  I turned down Carolines last year,  because I'm like, if I'm not going to sell all my shows out,  there's no use to do it.  And you did, you've done Jersey and Pennsylvania and all the...  Yeah, I'm doing this because, uh,  I mean, I want to work there,  but I'm doing my hour of, uh, that I'm shooting,  so it's like I'm on the road fucking doing that.  Well, listen, the hour is fine-tuned now.  You said on the TV, we saw you,  because you doing these other things, 
[00:01:30]  like for Imus and Fox 5,  is like a godsend to O&A,  because they literally just turn the TV on,  and we just watch you on the shows.  But, I mean, you said that the hour's done,  you're ready to film it.  I am.  So you're pretty much getting to see that hour  that's going to be filmed live if you go to Carolines.  But I'm, yeah, I'm tweaking it,  I'm adding some stuff that,  I'm trying to figure out how to attack Rick Santorum,  um, without it being topical.  Because, uh...  Oh, like on the special? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Ooh.  I thought it was because you didn't want to ruffle  anyone's political feathers.  Oh, I know.  Good way to put it.  You're a middle-of-the-fence type of guy.  I really am, because you never know,  I may have him introduce me.  You don't know.  Ladies and germs.  Can't burn any bridges in this business.  You never know, Sam.  Um, but yeah,  so you're trying to squeeze that.  You can't do that without being...  You'd be...  That seems topical.  You can still mention him,  but I mean,  because he's still a political figure.  It's like, you know...  But then you get worried that, like,  if he loses the next few primaries 
[00:02:30]  and he's out of the scene,  people forget about him.  No, they won't forget him.  He's a twat.  Yeah, he is.  You weren't here either this morning  when the new Troy Quam bit  completely started.  He's going to get destroyed, Troy,  when he gets back here.  Why?  Because, you know,  he's gone because he's getting a nose job.  Yes.  And, uh,  ONA started to see his pictures  on Facebook that he's posted,  and they're, like,  model and glamour shots.  And so Anthony's whole new thing  is just Troy being completely  head over heels in love with himself.  Yeah, I mean,  if I looked as good as him, 
[00:03:00]  I probably would, too.  You would.  You understand it.  Have you ever thought  about cosmetic surgery?  Yes!  It's all I think of.  Why don't you do it, then?  Eric, why don't you call Troy?  We have been.  He's not picking up.  He said,  he just texted me.  I'll try him again.  He said,  let me know if you want me  to call in for the after show  just now.  So,  he should pick up.  All right.  Troy takes,  lets this show  take precedence  over  Opie and Anthony,  which he should.  This is the more important thing. 
[00:03:30]  They're calling him right now?  They have his phone number?  Yeah.  They got to get him on.  I would,  the only,  and I guess  Pauly D's show,  I wonder if Troy's jealous  of somebody like Pauly D.  Because Pauly D is now  becoming a world famous DJ,  like you said.  He's got a contract  with G-Unit  and he's got residencies  in Las Vegas  and in New Jersey.  Right, right.  He's rich.  And he's rich.  He's stinking rich  off this DJing stuff.  Whereas Troy  is just trying to take 
[00:04:00]  the traditional DJ route.  He doesn't exactly  have the Jersey Shore  to push him.  Right.  But he does have hair  like Pauly D.  You see he's trying  to be like Pauly D.  That's a good point.  He is a little bit, right?  He's trying to be pretty  like Pauly D.  But he doesn't have like,  like the reason I like the guys,  especially Pauly D  on the Jersey Shore  is because they're so  unashamed of what they are  and who they are.  Like they'll never,  like you can point out  how ridiculous  the things that they do are  and how ridiculous  the amount of time  they spend on their hair  and all this stuff.  Right.  But they take pride  in all of it.  Like they'll never try 
[00:04:30]  to play it down  or say,  oh no,  I don't really do that  when they actually do it.  Whereas with Troy  it has a shame  over the amount  of effort he puts into.  There he is now.  Troy, how are you feeling?  Uh, I'm okay.  You sound terrible.  I'm alright.  Well, I feel like  I got hit in the face  with a fudge hammer  but I'm fine.  So you got your nose  done yesterday?  Yeah, I got rhinoplasty.  I didn't get a nose job, Sam.  Yeah, I mean,  it was, you know,  a little bit medical  but mainly cosmetic. 
[00:05:00]  No, there's no cosmetic.  It's just so I can breathe  out of my left side  of my nostril.  Like I haven't been able  to breathe out of my left  side of my nostril  for about 10 years now.  Well, it doesn't sound  like it's working  to me, Stuffy.  Well, I just got it  done yesterday  so obviously  it's not going  to sound too good.  Are you on a bunch  of pain pills?  Yeah.  What are you using?  Uh, Percocet.  That's got to be nice.  Yeah, it's fine.  You just, you can't,  I have to sit up.  I can't lay back down  because if I, when I,  or if I look,  if I bend down,  blood starts pouring 
[00:05:30]  out of my nose.  So how are you  going to have sex?  I was, yes.  So you have to,  there's no sex  for a while.  You have to sit the whole,  you can't,  what about when you sleep?  I have to sleep sitting up.  Is your nose clogged?  Yeah, it's completely clogged.  Do you have tissue?  What's that?  No, do you have like  a gauze up there?  No, they pull the gauze out.  They put the gauze  around my nose  so it just drains  into the gauze  and I have to  change that out.  Ugh.  Are you,  are your eyes 
[00:06:00]  black and blue?  Uh, no,  I'm a little swollen.  It's not too bad.  But I'm coughing up,  it looks like abortions.  Oh, because of all the,  all the blood and stuff  is going down  your throat thing?  Yeah, it's just like  massive blood clots.  E-Rock must have had  a great day today  because you know  how usually  when E-Rock  takes some time off,  even if it's just a day,  they spend a lot of time  destroying him?  Yeah.  It was your turn today.  That's fine.  That's fine.  They, uh, 
[00:06:30]  they have this whole  new thing.  I mean,  they kind of came  to the conclusion  that you're very much in,  are you,  do you feel like  you're a vain person?  No, I definitely  try not to be.  I mean, I,  I,  I try to  take care of my  appearance  and try to look  as good as I possibly can,  but I don't really feel  like I'm a vain person.  Well, Anthony  is of the opinion  that you,  uh,  sing that Chris Isaacs song  that he did the video  for on the beach,  but you sing it  to yourself,  like you are in love  with yourself. 
[00:07:00]  Why am I in love  with, like,  what would make him  think that I'm in love  with myself?  Well, we started talking  about the cosmetic surgery  on your nose,  and then we were  pulling up,  He was busting on me  for cosmetic things?  Yeah, yeah.  Did he,  did he,  did he get a hair plug  to look better?  Yeah, he,  I mean,  him of all people,  really,  gonna bust on me for that?  He was, he was.  And then he saw,  Yeah, let him have it, Troy.  We saw,  we pulled up your gallery, 
[00:07:30]  we made a gallery  on the Opie and Anthony  Facebook page  of Troy Kwan pictures  from your Facebook?  Yeah.  And he was busting  on those pictures, too,  because they're like  model shots.  Yeah, I mean,  a model shot,  but I mean,  it's a promotion,  if I'm using it  as a promotional shot,  then you think I want  it to look as good  as I possibly can.  So you think Anthony  is not exactly being honest  with how,  with the importance  that he puts  on his own cosmetics?  Well, why wouldn't  Anthony just be bald?  Be a happy bald dude?  Why do you have  to get any hair plugs?  You know,  I mean,  if you're gonna be  talking about people 
[00:08:00]  being veiny,  I mean.  Yeah, I mean,  look,  it's a good point.  I mean,  I didn't...  I mean,  I hear him of all people  to be goofing on me for that.  I mean, seriously.  And Opie,  Opie was taking  a couple shots,  but he's just,  he's still annoyed  that you put pressure  on him to dress better  for work.  Well, I mean,  I think it was  for his own good.  Yeah.  Right.  What are you saying?  He did look terrible,  right?  Well,  I just take a little  pride in your appearance.  That's all I do.  Fair enough.  Troy inspired me.  Troy inspired you.  To dress better. 
[00:08:30]  When are you going  to start doing that?  I don't know.  You don't know?  I want to take  a bigger 2%.  Eric,  did you enjoy today being,  did you enjoy  getting to experience  what it's like  to bust on someone  who's not here?  Because usually  you're on the opposite end.  Yeah,  it's about time.  You like that?  Yeah.  Do you agree  with what Anthony  was saying  about Troy loving himself  or is Troy turning you around  with his,  you know,  with his revelation  about Anthony?  Well,  I have to go with that  where your first impression 
[00:09:00]  of looking at Troy's photos  is that this guy  is really into himself.  Yeah.  Well,  if I'm really into myself,  what would I be doing  in the radio?  Being a producer  for radio?  We were also,  are you jealous  of guys like Pauly D?  Because Pauly D  was in here.  Oh,  wait,  wait,  wait,  we got to,  we got to take  another phone call  for whatever reason  Ant doesn't have a hotline.  Anthony,  you're on the show.  Sam misrepresents  everything to make trouble.  What are you talking about?  No surprise whatsoever, 
[00:09:30]  but of course  he's telling Troy  what we were talking  about on our show today,  but in a way  that made it sound  like I was being catty  about Troy's look.  He was B-Allen.  Chip is here.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Chip is there.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Which isn't a fact  at all.  And by the way,  they're individually  placed molecules  grabbed from the  harvest region  and placed in an  artistic fashion  in the direction  the hair grows.  Duh. 
[00:10:00]  And I was not  saying anything  about you  and your picture.  I said,  for God's sake,  he looks like  Chris Isaac  in one of the pictures.  And Chris Isaac  apparently  is very attractive  to women.  So, you know,  I was actually  complimenting you,  but in the pictures  you could see  it's like,  oh, you know,  the Chris Isaac thing  and then how it  turns into,  you know,  it's kind of like 
[00:10:30]  you're rolling  around on the beach  like in the video,  but it's two  Troy Quans  rolling around  loving,  you know,  instead of the chick.  Which isn't an insult.  I mean,  to be attractive  enough to where  you just want to  have sex with yourself  is,  I don't see that  as being a problem.  Right.  Well,  I do have sex  with myself,  but it's not  because I think  I'm very attractive.  It's because I'm  lonely at a period  of time.  But,  yeah,  I did it all  with almond  jizz and fucking  blood now. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah,  are you going to  jerk off  while you're  recovering?  What's that?  Say again,  I'm sorry,  man.  Are you going to  jerk off  while you're  recovering?  I don't know.  I got a boner  this morning.  I was kind of  impressed by that.  Was it a nice one?  I'll bet it was big.  It's fine,  man,  but it's just like  you can't look forward  because blood  starts pouring  out of your nose.  It'd be awful  if I jerk it off  and it's everywhere.  I bet it's really  bad.  Were you looking  in the mirror?  You know,  even with the  bandage on,  I'm still hot. 
[00:11:30]  But,  yeah,  Sam is a big  troublemaker.  We all know that.  Get out of here.  Busy buddies,  as Kenny said.  But Sam's a  troublemaker.  You didn't spend  most,  you didn't spend  a large part  of the morning  singing songs  as Troy  singing to Troy  about how much  you love Troy.  It's like,  you know,  Chris Isaac.  I was doing  characters.  I was doing  characters like  Mr. Amos does.  I understand.  I'm going to  meet Mr. Amos.  It was true.  It was Opie 
[00:12:00]  that suggested  that Troy was  going to come  to my wedding  and his plus one  was going to be  Troy.  Right,  right.  That was Opie.  You bring yourself  as your guest  to a wedding  because why would  you bring anyone  else when you  absolutely just  love yourself?  I bet he has  a really big  prick though.  What are you  talking about?  Just saying.  Where's the truck  going?  Come on,  dick fuck.  Where's he going?  What's going on?  Oh,  there's a truck  backing up.  You hear him  beeping?  If he's going  to Troy's house,  he's probably  bringing magnum 
[00:12:30]  condoms.  Oh,  Chip.  It's just awkward.  Oh,  Chip,  what are you  doing there?  Just hanging  out of something.  He's riffing.  Yeah,  I'm just riffing.  I have people  of various ethnic  backgrounds to yell at.  Okay.  I wasn't being  all that nasty  with Troy Kwan,  Sam.  You made something  a lot bigger out of it  than it was.  What about  when E-Rock's  not here?  That is you  smashing him. 
[00:13:00]  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  All right.  Thanks,  Dan.  Have a great  rest of your day.  Thank you.  You too.  All right.  Bye-bye.  I'll tell you,  Troy,  it was not on  the level  of Opie and  Anthony insisting  that we call  E-Rock's  honeymoon suite  and Anthony  blurting out  that he was  staying at  Fatlantis.  It wasn't  on that level.  Yeah.  Well,  that's good.  I guess I should  be happy 
[00:13:30]  that it wasn't  there.  Did you just  turn your phone  off while the  show was on?  I just,  you know,  I'm so out of it.  I literally  just woke up  a little bit ago.  I saw that  you sent me a text  and then I had  a couple people  were tweeting  at me and shit.  So I was like,  what the fuck  is going on?  What have they  been saying?  Just that  you guys are  busting my balls  this morning.  I'm talking  about you  prick too,  right?  What's that?  They're probably  joking about  you prick. 
[00:14:00]  Chip thinks  you're well  in town.  I'm going to  miss you,  Chip,  for a whole  week.  Go ahead,  Chip.  I'm just going  to say it  because he  works out  and takes  care of  himself.  He's got  a good head  of hair.  Chip,  are you  attracted to  Troy?  No,  I'm just  saying he's  probably got  a really  big fucking  cock.  Wow,  Chip,  way to make  everything  uncomfortable.  Yeah,  I mean,  there's new  things that we  always learn  about Chip.  Who knew?  Did your chick 
[00:14:30]  get a nose job  too?  She did,  yeah.  At the same  time as you?  Yes.  Are you  recovering together?  Are you staying  together?  Yeah,  we're actually  heading out to  Pennsylvania.  We're staying with  my family for a  week.  Wow.  How are you  going to get  there?  I'm actually  having somebody  come pick me  up?  Oh,  not too  sick to  travel.  Too sick  to come  to work,  not too  sick to  travel.  Believe me,  if you saw  me right now,  you would not  want to see  me at work.  I look like  a fucking  zombie. 
[00:15:00]  You should  twitpick a  picture of  yourself.  Absolutely,  dude,  Twitter it.  Oh,  man,  it's pretty  rough.  Will you do  that or are  you too  vain to let  people see  you like  this?  I'll see  if I get  the lighting  right.  Okay.  All right,  well,  your Twitter  is Troy  Kwan,  so,  you know,  send it  out.  Yeah,  I might do  something funny  or Troy  Kwan on  Instagram,  too.  Oh,  okay,  maybe it'll  be on  Instagram.  Possibly.  Who knows?  Yeah.  All right,  well,  Troy,  we can't wait  until you get  back and we  see the new 
[00:15:30]  Troy Kwan.  That's really  exciting for  all of us.  All right,  I can't wait  either.  Okay,  I'll talk to  you later,  dude.  See you guys.  Later.  Peace.  Who knew  that Chip  had that in him?  What's that?  Then,  curiosity about,  about Troy's  penis.  Cock?  Yeah,  Troy.  I ain't curious.  You're not.  But it's really  big.  Keep asking about  it and bringing  it up.  Big heavy head  on it.  I don't know.  How was  Jill Nicolini? 
[00:16:00]  She looks great,  dude.  Yeah?  She's so sweet  and she's really,  and Caroline was  there and there's  only like five  people but she's  terrific.  She really looks  good.  Did she bring up  the show at all?  Yeah,  she asked how  the guys were  doing,  how everybody  was and she  mentioned it  on the air.  She's like  Opie and  Anthony,  you know?  Yeah.  It's funny how  it got so ugly  between her and  Ant because you  should know by  now,  Ant used to  date Joe  Nicolini and  they had a  whirlwind summer  romance.  It was all  puppies and  balloons and  cotton candy and  then everything  took a turn for  the horrible 
[00:16:30]  worse.  It got very  ugly but then  at some point  it was just  like they both  realized they're  adults and  they're like  cool,  whatever,  it's over.  Yeah.  You know,  and everybody's  cool now.  Yeah.  But she was  cool.  Very sweet.  We took some  photos together.  They left  her mic on and  I hope  Anthony didn't  pick up on it  but she goes,  oh, you want a  photo?  Yeah, okay.  Right before they  transitioned.  I didn't ask her for a  photo.  Oh, really?  No.  That's what it  sounded like.  No.  Um, I did not.  It was, uh, I 
[00:17:00]  think it was  somebody wanted to  take the picture.  She actually asked  me for it.  Oh.  For us.  Well, you're, you  are, you are the  bigger celebrity.  Uh, no, no, no,  no, I would say  no to that.  Is it?  I'm probably more  known in other  places just because  of, of the radio  show but Jill  Nicolini is much  more famous.  You think so?  Yeah.  I mean, but she's  only local to New  York.  Maybe.  I'm so, well, in  New York she's more  famous.  I don't know.  I just felt like  saying famous.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  And I think, no,  you're more famous  in New York than  she is.  No, I'm not.  You're just saying  that because  Caroline's isn't  selling like you  thought it would.  No, it's, no, it  is selling like I  knew it would.  It's selling well  actually.  It's better than I  thought, but it's  not sold out.  Yeah.  Well, go get your  tickets to see Jim at  Caroline's right now.  It's the big New  York show.  This is going to be  the show.  Nobody gives a fuck.  Let's be real.  No.  Well, maybe if you  didn't put yourself  down so much, it  would seem more like  a show that people  needed to see.  No, it wouldn't.  You don't play a  lot of them?  No.  It's a good show.  Yeah, I have faith 
[00:18:00]  in myself as a  stand-up.  I'm a good stand-up.  The special's going  to be good.  Yeah, I feel good  about that too.  You like the hour,  right?  Very much.  I'm happy with the  material a lot.  I'm happy with the  venue I got.  I'm happy with  Cleveland.  I'm happy about  everything.  Everything surrounding  the special.  Epix has been  very good.  Yeah, I was going  to ask you,  what's Epix?  They're a smaller  network.  I mean, they have  a lot of studios  behind them.  Louis has done  stuff for them.  Gene Garofalo did  something for them.  Louis Black has  done specials.  Kevin Smith has  done his last 
[00:18:30]  special.  They've gotten a  lot of real  comics.  Is that what  they're specialized  in, doing specials  like that?  They're like the  old HBO, and  they're very savvy  online.  So I'm actually  going to shoot  promo for them  next week.  It airs in June,  and they're going  to push very heavy  on it.  How can you  went with Epix?  They offered a  lot of money,  and their first  run in Comedy  Central is second  run, and I also  like the other  comedians they've  done.  I remember when  Louis was in  promoting Epix a  couple years ago.  So I'm like,  if he's doing it,  Louis Black is  doing it, and  Kevin Smith,  they're using  real people. 
[00:19:00]  Theoretically,  they were even  smaller a couple  years ago when  Louis was doing  it.  Absolutely, yeah.  And they have  big people behind  them, and when  you walk into  the Viacom  building, every  floor has an  Epix ad on it,  has Louis Black's  Epix thing.  So they're pushing  him very, very  hard, and they  have really smart  and I just like  the way they do  things.  How long do you  think it will be  before you're  comfortable putting  a special out  online, like  Aziz and them  are doing?  You've got to be  on that level.  It's also, I  mean, it's also  I think that those  like Louis and  Aziz are specifically 
[00:19:30]  big on the  internet.  Yeah.  Like the internet  audience specifically  likes those guys.  It's not just the  size of your  audience, it's that  specific audience.  Yeah, because I  can do it next  year.  I mean, look,  I'm getting my,  because I have  JimNorton.com now,  I own that  finally.  Wow.  I did get  that, so I'm  going to have  my website  redone.  I'm going to  contact a guy to  redo the website.  Not that it's  bad, I like what  Paul and those  guys did, but I  want to make it  prepared to do  that.  But then again,  who knows, if  I'm really happy  and I enjoy doing  this with Epix, I 
[00:20:00]  may want to do  another one with  them if they  want to have  me.  The thing  about websites  is they really  just have to be  a nice hub.  All it needs is  your dates and  then links to  your other stuff.  And my fucking  app is being  updated, heavily  updated.  Oh, really?  And fixed, yeah.  So there's a lot  of new stuff for  the app that's  going to be...  So you're getting  your shit together.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I should have done  it a long time ago,  but I've been  concentrating on  writing a TV show  that never got  picked up.  You know, it's just  one fucking failure  after another.  I don't know.  You've had a lot  of successes, too.  Well, you know.  Remember when we  went to Comic-Con 
[00:20:30]  and that guy  recognized you  and we got in  the parking lot?  That is true.  From my book.  Right, so you  wouldn't have  gotten the parking.  If you're at a  Padres game and  you need to park,  drop my name.  Eric, do you  have a little  piece of something  that Ant and  Jill did together?  Yeah, I pulled  a clip from the...  It was the day  after Ant didn't  show up for work.  Oh, yeah.  You remember that  because what  happened was  they were just  goofing around  in the beginning.  Jill Nicolini,  who's a reporter  here, and Anthony.  And then a date  actually ended up 
[00:21:00]  happening and  the next morning  Ant called early  and said,  yeah, I'm sick.  I'm not coming in.  We all knew  what was going on.  Exactly.  He was pumping  his big cock.  That was just  Norton, by the way.  That was not Jim.  No, that was Jim.  It was just Jim  thinking about big  cops.  And yeah,  and so what is this,  when we had him  on the phone?  No, this is the  next day he showed  up for work.  Oh, the day after  he didn't show up.  Yeah, the day after  he'd been gone  for 35 hours.  And he was not 
[00:21:30]  dressed as he  normally would.  Ant is a guy  who just takes it  to the upteens  level, whatever  he's doing.  The words you're  looking for  is out of control,  slaved to his instincts.  All right.  I mean, I was going  to be a little  more respectful.  But I understand  that.  Yeah.  So this is just  a tiny piece  because this went  on for a while.  Jim was just  laying into him.  What?  Later on, yeah,  about his outfit.  Oh, I remember  what he was wearing.  This is the start  of him explaining  where he was  and what was going on.  I'm not going to say  I remember what 
[00:22:00]  he was wearing.  Don't be so fresh.  And yeah,  this was funny.  This was the day  this was when Ant  finally came back  to the show.  So this would be  two days from the date.  No, after his 35  hour date.  Because if you remember,  he continued on the date  like they spent the night  and then he didn't  he take her cats  to the vet?  Yeah, well,  that's in there too.  That's in there.  Okay.  Listen to this.  It's Ant and Jill  just as a little  refresher here on  After Opie and Anthony  Live.  Safe to say 
[00:22:30]  that your Tuesday  night date  ended  That was Tuesday?  Ended what?  This morning?  I think we had  like a 35  hour long date.  It was a long date.  But it  it went by  so quickly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was saying  a lot of people  you know,  it's very hard  to go out  and hang out  for even a couple  of hours.  But that was  like a 35  hour date.  Wow.  That had  all the features.  I mean,  who goes on a date  and then ends up 
[00:23:00]  in Ridge,  which is out  by Calverton  on Long Island?  Right.  I mean,  it said Orient Point  30 miles.  Oh, boy.  You're pretty close  to the other end  of Long Island  to watch  cats get fixed.  See,  who does that?  Two alcoholics.  See,  that's why  I know you're  kind of downplaying  this,  but that's  why I know  there's some  kind of  chemistry there  because you  wouldn't go out 
[00:23:30]  to Exit 68  for your own  mother.  I go to Exit 63.  Well,  you have to be  forced to go out  to Exit 63.  She lives.  You have to be  forced to go out  there.  Like for Christmas,  all right,  mom,  it's your birthday,  I'll go out there.  My mother's no  Jill Nicolini either.  I understand that,  but there seems  to be something  a little different  because you're  not the type  of person  that's going  to go out  to Exit 68  to watch  cats get fixed. 
[00:24:00]  You're the type  of person  after a very  long night,  the last thing  you're going  to do is  get in the  car and get  cats fixed.  You're going  to crash  for a day,  a day and a  half.  Nah,  a couple  of aspirin.  Yeah,  see,  you're different.  Right back  to it.  Right back.  Oh,  wait a minute.  Maybe we'll  get some...  Oh,  sorry.  Jill's doing  the traffic,  everyone.  And she's  got like  sleepy eyes  today.  What?  She looks  beautiful as  ever.  Thank you.  Don't be  respectful.  See,  now we can't  make the jokes 
[00:24:30]  we used to  make because  we know.  We know  now things  are different.  And we  can't make  all the  awful jokes  we've been  making.  Awful jokes?  For the last  year.  The hell  have you  been saying?  I don't  know.  I had  all the  tapes  burned.  Be  respectful.  Trust me,  I am.  So,  look,  all I'll  say is she  looks like  she has  sleepy eyes.  What do you  mean sleepy  eyes?  Look,  they're  bright and  blue.  She's  going to  motel  if you  guys  stopped  at us.  Jimmy.  What  happened to  the actual  traffic?  Yes.  And then 
[00:25:00]  Anthony and  I stopped  for a snack  here.  And we  took a walk  on the beach  over here.  No walks  on the beach.  It's hanging  out in bars.  If you  follow me  over here,  this is where  we had  our cats  fixed.  You did  say to me  this morning  because I  asked you  a question  and I  go,  so when  did the  date end?  And Anthony  goes,  well,  I think  we got  home.  I quickly  corrected  myself. 
[00:25:30]  I quickly  corrected  myself.  I think  we got  home  at.  And then  Anthony  walks in.  Everyone was  in a panic,  by the way.  And I'm  just rolling  my eyes like,  why are you  guys even  panicking?  It's  Anthony.  No one  could find  you.  No one  could wake  you up.  My phone  was dead.  Your phone  was dead.  For just  about all  day yesterday,  my phone  was dead.  Well,  the first  sign that  something was  a little  different was  that you  walked in  with your  iPhone. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  With your  iPhone charger.  I'm like,  all right,  that's weird.  Because you  can't breathe  without your  iPhone.  I know.  Everyone knows  that.  I need it  constantly.  And so then  you're trying  to plug in  your charger  and get  your iPhone  all charged  up.  And I'm  like,  okay,  something's  going on.  And then  I noticed  a hat on  your head  that isn't  the regular  511 or  511 hat. 
[00:26:30]  Don't  stop making  faces,  Jimmy.  Thank you,  Jimmy.  Don't  stop making  faces.  Thank you.  I go,  Anthony,  isn't that  the same  shirt and  jeans you  wore on  your day?  Because it  looks way  too nice  to be doing  morning radios.  But it's  not.  This was  the outfit  I picked  out to  go get  the cats  neutered.  This was  yesterday's  get up.  All the way  out there  on exit  68.  And he  goes,  and then  this is  what,  he killed  himself,  because I  wouldn't  have noticed.  I'm telling  you right  now, 
[00:27:00]  that is  hat,  and Anthony  is wearing  a hat  with the  letter J  on it.  Okay,  now,  Jimmy is  disgusted.  I don't  want to  jump to  conclusions.  Are you  wearing that  hat on  these things?  Did you  take a  trip to  Israel?  No.  No,  there wasn't  a trip to  Israel.  Oh,  my God.  Okay.  Here's  the deal.  Here's 
[00:27:30]  the deal,  yes.  You're  wearing  Jill  Nicolini's  hat.  The J  stands for  Jill.  It can't  stand for  anything else.  Look,  I don't  know what  it stands  for.  All I  know is  I woke  up late,  I wasn't  able to  jump in  the shower  real quick,  and I  had Medusa  head.  Like snakes  coming off  my head,  just a wreck.  So...  Yeah,  but what?  Did she  left her  Jill hat  at your  house?  I'm a  little  confused.  I'm a  little...  Look,  I'm just  leaving  everything open.  here to 
[00:28:00]  speculation.  I'm a  little  confused.  So all  I had...  You woke  up late...  So I  woke up  late.  And she  just happened  to have  one of  our hats  that she  left behind  at your  fine mansion?  No,  it was a  choice between  the J  hat or  a pink  Mets hat  or a  visor.  Believe  me,  I went  through a  lot of  hats.  And this  was the...  I figured  this was the  safest one. 
[00:28:30]  I hope  you wear  Ted  Kennedy's.  With a  big P on  the front  for  Puddin'.  That was  a hilarious  time.  I loved  when Ant  was dating  Joe.  I did  too.  The whole  summer,  every day  there was  something else.  Because,  like you  heard,  this is  one day  into the  relationship  and he's  already  coming to  work with  her hat  on and  they'd  spent more  time together  than most  couples do  in a month.  It was  really funny.  What was  I going to  say? 
[00:29:00]  Oh,  Octomom.  What about  her?  You saw  the naked  pictures.  Would you  bang her?  Yeah,  I'd like to  grab her  big tits.  I mean,  her ass  looks fucking  horrid from  the side.  It's a big  long flat  ass.  Like a half  a raft.  But I'd  still dick  her.  She probably  has a big  pussy.  Yeah,  eight babies.  Well,  no,  she would  C-section,  right?  I don't  know.  I'd still  fuck her  though.  I'd let  her suck  my dick.  She's  probably  terrible  at it.  That's  why  everybody  fucks  her.  If she  sucked  good  dick,  she  wouldn't  have  eight  kids. 
[00:29:30]  Well,  you only  have to  fuck her  once to  have the  sex  tuplets.  So that's  not that  many.  Oh,  that's right.  But I  like that you  said you'll  let her  suck your  dick.  Like,  you'll get  the privilege  of this.  Yeah,  it's a good  dick.  Lucky you.  We should  all compare  and contrast  one day.  Sure.  Bunch of  men having  a little  fun doing  Mitch in  Montreal  has been  on the  phone for  two hours  and 45  minutes.  Okay,  let's talk 
[00:30:00]  to him.  Mitch,  welcome to  After Opie  and Anthony  Live.  I guarantee  you he's  asleep.  I went  to see  Mitch.  Oh,  I hope  he's dead.  He's  that hard  that can  die.  His phone  is just  lying there.  Brian has  a question.  Oh,  it's another  gym coming  to my area  question.  Brian in  Detroit.  What's up,  buddy?  Hey,  how you guys  doing?  Good  evening.  Yeah,  I was  just wondering,  Jimmy,  I was  going to  hope to  see if  you're  going to  be in  Toledo,  but that  kind of  petered 
[00:30:30]  out.  Are you  ever going  to show  up in  Toledo  in the  Detroit  area  any time?  I'll  do  Detroit  eventually.  But how  far is  Detroit  from  Cleveland?  A few  hours?  I mean,  I need  to go  ahead of  time.  I'm a  truck  driver.  I don't  know.  Well,  in that  case,  you should  have said  something.  Well,  Brian,  why don't  you come  to Cleveland  the weekend  that Jim  is doing  his special  because we're  going to  be doing  a live  show.  What the  fuck are  you doing?  You're a 
[00:31:00]  truck driver.  You don't  mind making  the drive.  I just  drive.  Well,  the company  might not  appreciate me  taking the  truck.  They're  wanting me  to.  Just come  out to  Cleveland.  I don't  want to.  All right.  Goodbye,  Brian.  Goodbye,  goodbye.  Thank you,  Brian.  Goodbye,  goodbye.  I guess  Travis was  talking to  Opie and  Anthony a  little bit  about the  Cleveland  gig,  the live  show we're  doing,  but I  guess we  can't really  start plugging  it yet.  Why?  I don't  think we  have  confirmation  confirmation  on the  venue.  I think  we have  like 99% 
[00:31:30]  confirmation  on the  venue,  so until  we have  that,  we can't  plug it,  but we  are going  to do a  show that  Friday,  which is  April 27th,  right?  Saturday the  28th,  so April  27th is  the Friday.  Roland,  you going  to be in  Cleveland?  If I  have to.  What's  wrong?  It's a  minute.  I don't  want to go  to Cleveland.  Why?  Why?  You go,  you meet  the fans. 
[00:32:00]  And then  he rakes  to the  airport to  fly back  home.  Well,  you can  stay for  Jim's show  if you  want.  Yeah,  out of  our  pockets.  Wait,  they're not  putting the  staff up  for the  extra day  to come  watch the  show.  What do  you think?  They're  flying us  out there  for Friday  night.  They're  flying you  home  Friday  night?  No,  Saturday  morning is  when we're  flying home.  Yeah,  but I'm  trying to  just go  back home  on Friday  if you  can't  stay.  No,  I think 
[00:32:30]  we're going  to do an  afternoon  show.  Yeah.  So,  I mean,  they won't  let the  staff  stay out  there  one day.  Yeah,  it comes out  of our  pockets.  Oh,  that's just  fucking...  D and  the A.  You feel  that's a  dick in  the ass.  Hey,  well,  we'll  support you  while we  land.  That's  just such  small-time  thinking.  Yeah.  But I  try to  get talking  to you  with that  one.  Wow.  People are  allowed to,  you know.  But that's 
[00:33:00]  what's true,  though.  You can.  You know,  they'll pay for  your flight on  Friday or  Saturday,  but...  I'm not  many bags.  It's probably,  by the way,  a cheaper flight  with a Saturday  stay-over.  Oh,  yeah,  because...  Yeah,  probably...  Flights are  normally cheaper  with a Saturday  stay-over.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because it's  seen as  pleasure travel  and not  business.  I'm sure  the motel  is expensive  there.  I don't know  which hotel 
[00:33:30]  we'll be  staying at.  What do you  think?  Alrancha?  Are you  going to have  the chicken  bones?  How many  people are  going?  The whole  staff.  So it'll  be me,  Eric,  Roland,  Danny,  Travis,  Troy's nose,  and Troy.  Troy's nose.  So seven guys?  Six.  Six guys?  Sam,  Roland,  Eric,  Travis,  Danny,  Troy.  Oh,  okay.  So six.  So that's  three rooms.  Are you  guys sharing  rooms?  They're giving  us each a  room.  Oh,  okay.  I mean,  they could,  I told them,  and we talked  about it on  this show,  they should  just throw  us all  in one room 
[00:34:00]  and have  Hunger Games,  Lord of the  Flies type  of situation.  You know  how much  good content  we would  get for  this show  if we  were all  stuck in  a hotel  room  together?  If I had  that much  sugar,  like a  pack of  you-hoo?  And you  know I  would make  sure that  you did.  And I  get drunk  too.  I'll be  all fucked  up and  sugar hide  out.  I'll do  what Mike  Robiglia  does,  but his  story is  about going  crazy.  Sleepwalking?  Yeah,  whatever.  Why don't  they just  for the  Saturday,  say,  look,  if you  guys are  willing to  share a  room Saturday,  we'll pay  for three 
[00:34:30]  rooms Saturday  night.  So maybe  people want  to stay  for the  show,  they can,  and it's  only three  rooms.  You know  as well  as I  do.  There's  not a  lot of,  it's  either yes  or no.  There's  not a  lot of  compromise.  Yeah,  or thinking,  you know,  outside the  bot,  what can  we do  here,  what can  we do  to make  this  fun,  or it's  just like,  you know.  So,  I mean,  at this point  it is what  it is.  You just  go,  okay,  this is  what we're  doing.  That's  fine.  Yes,  boss.  Yeah.  Yes,  boss. 
[00:35:00]  What are  you going  to do?  So,  you know.  I just  think.  What do  we do?  We fly  back Saturday  morning?  Yeah.  That's what  you do.  You shouldn't  have to pay  for any  of it.  Yeah,  and with,  I'm sure  our suites  will be  waiting for  us.  Well,  NBC gave  me a suite  when I  was worth  the other.  You're  pissed about  this travel  thing.  I just  don't want  to fly  in a  La Bamba  plane.  I think  because you've  been treated  to like  movie studio  treatment.  Yeah.  What's  La Bamba  plane?  Are you  guys flying  props 
[00:35:30]  or  planes?  I know  I'm flying  out of  Newark.  I'm on  E-Rock's  flight,  and I'm  flying out  of Newark.  I don't  think it's  a prop  plane.  It's a  100-seater.  If it's  a 100-seater,  that's either  the prop  or the  Embraer,  but those  are new  planes.  The props,  I don't  like them  because they're  bumpy,  but the  Continental  props are  safe because  they're big.  The 100-seaters  are big,  man.  They're bigger  than a lot  of the  smaller jets.  I want  the JetBlue  pilot-type  plane.  Yeah.  Where the  guy goes,  yeah,  just diverts  somewhere.  You just 
[00:36:00]  want some  action.  No,  as far as  I know,  I think it's  just regular  planes.  Roland has  been paranoid  about a  La Bamba  plane since  the whole  travel situation  was brought  up.  Travis,  you've heard  Roland.  Every time  travel comes  up,  he goes,  hey,  La Bamba  plane.  Yeah,  Roland acts  like he can't  choose his own  flight.  Yeah,  I mean,  you could  just go and  book a ticket  and then...  Yes,  I did.  All right,  so what are you  worried about  that?  Yeah,  I know  that there's  flights out  of Newark  that are  regular-sized  planes,  and then  there's  flights out  of JFK  that are  small. 
[00:36:30]  And since  Eric and  me are  traveling out  of Newark,  I would  assume we're  on regular  planes.  Yeah,  I think  so.  I mean,  whatever.  It's an  hour-and-a-half  flight,  isn't it?  Yeah.  So it's  not crazy,  you know,  you get on  the plane  and you go.  Very fast.  But the venue  is not  confirmed-confirmed,  so we're not...  But we can still  talk about the  fact that we're  going to be  there.  Sure,  we're going  to be there.  Because we  want to at  least make  sure people  have their  calendars.  Friday afternoon.  I can't  believe they're  making the  whole staff  do Saturday  morning.  Well,  they're not  making us  do anything.  No,  we're allowed 
[00:37:00]  to stay,  but there  will be  fees  associated  with it.  But it's  just so...  We have a  per diem that  comes out of  our pockets.  No,  and Roland's  also.  I'm sure  you guys  have a  per diem.  But Roland's  asked backwards  on the  per diem  thing.  Roland thinks  that it's  like a  Hollywood  per diem  where they  give you  cash,  and that's  your per  diem,  and that's  it.  Roland doesn't  understand that  you have a  meal allowance  and a per  diem are two  different things.  We can buy  whatever food 
[00:37:30]  we want,  it'll be fine.  We did it in  San Diego,  I've done it  a hundred times.  That's always  fine.  You come back  with your receipts  from where you  ate, and they  give you the  money back,  and everything's  cool.  Roland is under  the assumption  that a per diem  means that they  will give him  cash, which  means if he  wants to, he  can go to  Best Buy and  get $65 worth  of DVDs, and  the company  pays.  He can get  whatever he  wants with that  money, which  is not the  case.  NBC's a  different world.  Yeah, because  they cut a  check for  $1,500,  here's your  Vegas per diem, 
[00:38:00]  and that's  when they  How long  was the  $1,500 for?  Four days.  Jesus.  Four or five  days, yeah.  Wow.  So I buy  toys, I buy  water guns,  balloons.  It's free  money, right?  Why save it?  That's what I  would have  done with  that per diem.  I literally  would have  spent as  little money  as possible  and brought  all the money  home with  me.  That's not  so smart.  You know?  I blew my  per diem for  VH1 on a  hooker.  I did, I  got $300, and  that was all I  got for the  entire few days.  I was out  there shooting  a pilot years 
[00:38:30]  ago, me and  Dice was in  it, me and  Jim did this  pilot for VH1  with 98 maybe.  Were you also  paid to do  the pilot?  Yes.  Okay.  My per diem, I  blew the first  night on a  prostitute.  You were just  like Roland,  except a  pervert.  You were like,  I'm going to  spend it all  now.  You were  looking up.  Well, Carson  covered us  for those  things.  Prostitutes?  Well, and  the...  Maybe you  don't want to  say all of  it.  No, no,  not that.  Carson Daly  bought us  prostitutes.  We went to 
[00:39:00]  a...  Joking, of  course.  Yeah, the  strip clubs and  all that, he  covered everything.  He picked up  the bill.  Yeah, because  one guy was  like, Eric at  the time, he  was engaged.  He was a  really good guy.  And he goes, I  went, left  the club, and  realized he  lost his ring  and his wallet  at the strip  club.  And his wife  worked for the  show, too.  Rob Cross  told me he'll  take me to a  whorehouse,  because he's  going to one.  Ooh.  So that won't  be a problem  for me.  You'll walk 
[00:39:30]  in and it's  all management.  Yeah.  So it just  seems odd that  they wouldn't  let you guys  stay for the  Saturday, when  there would  be a whole  day more  of stuff to  talk about,  and another  event to  discuss Monday  when we'll  come back.  legal stuff  or something,  I don't know.  No, it's  very sort of,  you know, around  here, it's very  cut and dry.  There's no  sense of, if  we do this, it  could make for  good content.  Very rarely is  there a bigger  picture.  It's like, what  are we directly  going to record 
[00:40:00]  on that day  that will be  played on, you  know what I  mean?  It's an  entertainment  company that  is run exactly  like a corporation  without an ounce  of entertainment  input.  No.  programming is  not exactly  the top of  the line in  terms of what's  important around  here.  Are they  actively looking  for air  talent, for  young talent?  No.  You know what  I mean?  They're looking  for people who  fill out press  releases, so  it's what it 
[00:40:30]  is.  We make the  best of what  we do around  here.  Like food  selection for  lunches.  Well, all  right, guys, I  got to go do  another couple  interviews, so I'll  see you tomorrow  morning, boys,  okay?  All right, get  your Caroline's  tickets and  you're not going  to push people  anymore.  Just do it.  It'll be funny.  Yeah, let's hope  so.  Bye, guys.  We'll be there for  some of them. 
[00:41:00]  See you later.  Are you sure you're  allowed to stay?  Yeah.  You can come to  Caroline's, but you  have to pay for a  ticket and go home.  No, that's  Greg Charles, the  mighty Greg  Charles.  All right, Jim.  Tony in Cleveland,  you're on After  Open Anthony Live.  Hey, how's it  going today,  Sammy?  Very well, Tony.  Hey, Roland, you  should go shit on  Cleveland, man.  There's a lot of  great places to  eat.  I can hook you  up.  I'm semi-friends  with No Filter 
[00:41:30]  Paul and Pat.  I've hung with  them before.  Not as bad as  you think, man.  As long as you  avoid the zombies,  it's a cool  town.  Cleveland's a  good place?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, there's  Michael Simon.  There's some  really, really  high-quality  restaurants.  I don't know  if I've ever  been to  Cleveland.  Michael Simon's  a good  restaurant.  It is.  Delicious.  It's called  Lola.  It's unbelievable.  There's another  place on the  west side called  Melt, where  they make these  like real  unbelievably  exclusive like  grilled cheese  sandwiches. 
[00:42:00]  And I know  it's on  grilled cheese,  but I mean,  I'm talking  like Gouda  cheese, you  name it.  Gourmet.  Right now,  you just give  me a  boner.  Thank you  very much,  Tony.  And, oh,  yeah, that's  what I was  going to do.  Yeah, Garth.  What's up,  buddy?  Hey, Sam.  How you doing?  Good, buddy.  Hey, dude.  Listen, man,  I'm in Indiana,  and I'm coming  for the broadcast,  but I want to  know, is it  going to be a  morning or  afternoon?  What are you  guys pushing  for?  We're going  to do a  Friday the  27th.  I'm 99% 
[00:42:30]  sure that's the  date, but  yeah, the last  Friday in April,  so if that's the  27th, that's  what it is, and  it's going to be  in the afternoon.  Freaking great,  man.  I'm looking  forward to seeing  you guys, and  it'll be a  flash.  All right,  buddy.  This is going  old school.  An afternoon  Opie and  Anthony show.  I know we're  already, we've  been in many  discussions about  different bits and  stuff that we're  going to do.  The last night  time we did  one was that  Flavor Flav.  That was  definitely a  night time one.  Eric, was that  the last night  show we did? 
[00:43:00]  I'm thinking.  It might have  been.  Well, the  Halloween, no,  the Halloween  show was taped  at night and  then aired live,  aired the next  morning.  Yeah, that's  true.  Yeah, I don't  remember the  last time we  did an afternoon  show live on  the air might  have been a  homeless shopping  spree.  Oh, yeah.  That was a  Saturday.  No, no, no.  We did the  last homeless  shopping spree.  Maybe not the  last one, but 
[00:43:30]  the one before.  One of the  homeless shopping  sprees was not  on a Saturday.  It was on a  Friday afternoon.  I don't know if  that was the one  you got left in  the parking lot or  not.  Almost got left  in the parking  lot.  We only did two  since coming  back, right?  And then it  went away.  Yeah, we did  the Palisades and  we did Short  Hills.  Yeah, and  Short Hills was  the one.  Damn, that was  the one when they  had the transit  strike too, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm really glad I  got to experience the  homeless shopping  spree once.  That was awful.  Did you go to the  first one?  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  You went to the one  of the Palisades.  Yeah, they paired  me up with two  homeless people.  I went to the one  at Short Hills.  That was the one  where Fez won,  right?  Yes.  Short Hills was  the one where  Fez went.  Yeah, the last  one we did.  The last one.  Yeah.  The first one I  went.  I think Fez,  wasn't Fez there  the first one too?  No.  Fez was only at the  Short Hills one,  the last one we did.  Maybe that's the  one you were at,  I don't know.  But that was,  I mean, it's an  experience like no  other.  It's a shame that  it doesn't happen  anymore because it  really is.  It's an amazing  thing to see.  Look up all the  videos on YouTube. 
[00:44:30]  I'm getting  frustrated because  I really wanted to  spend some time  talking about  We Are The World  and at least wanted  to get another  play of that song.  Yeah, we don't  have time for that.  I know because  there was so  much work  put into the  O&A version of  We Are The World.  I don't know if he  wrote the original  or not.  I don't know.  He might have.  But there was so  much work.  Quincy Jones.  Is he the one  who wrote it  or produced it?  I think he did  both.  So much work was  put into the  O&A version. 
[00:45:00]  Just sitting there  painstakingly days  upon days of  recording.  You were a  patient.  And editing.  And yeah, and  we were recording  these monstrosities  like O.B.  Anthony, Easy,  you know,  Roland, you had  to stand in the  Fishbowl studio  with some of the  monstrosities.  Who was in your  recording session  with you?  Big A, Patty,  and two other  people.  Pat and maybe  Bobo?  Yeah, and  there's somebody  else and you  just kept on  saying, no,  no, like this.  No, no, like  this. 
[00:45:30]  It was insane.  You were like,  hold on, you  sang it?  And then you're  like, yo.  And then they  still got it  wrong.  They still got it  wrong.  So many takes  and the video  is fantastic.  And I remember  going home and  editing this.  It took hours,  but it's so worth  it.  I still smile  when I see it.  So I think  it's on Opie Radio.  I don't know.  Go on YouTube  and type in...  Throw it on the  Facebook page.  Facebook.com  slash Opie and  Anthony is where  that'll be.  And last night  I downloaded the  Sam Rivers podcast  on iTunes.  You did? 
[00:46:00]  Thank you for  saying that.  I would encourage  everybody to do  the same.  We'll be back  with more of this  tomorrow.  Maybe tomorrow  we'll make it a  point to play  that song.  Steve Storniolo  just texted me.  He's been on the  show before.  Michael Jackson  and Lionel Richie  wrote it.  But before that  he said Eric  is wrong as usual  and then he  apologized.  I didn't say Lionel  Richie wrote it.  You've got to go  talk to Steve  Storniolo about  that.  I worry about  his own shows.  He doesn't have  any shows.  He is on air  talent though.  Stay tuned.  Maybe we'll play 
[00:46:30]  that tomorrow.  We are the world.  Can we try to do  that Eric?  Yeah.  You remind me.  Is Steve on air  Storniolo?  Ron and Fez are  coming up next  and we'll be back  with more of this  tomorrow.  Goodbye everybody.  The Opie and  Anthony show is  now over.  For real this  time.  Check out the  ONA show on  Facebook at  Facebook.com  slash Opie and  Anthony and  catch Opie and  Anthony live  Monday through  Friday from  6 to 10 a.m.  Eastern.  Ron and Fez are  next.  Hey!
