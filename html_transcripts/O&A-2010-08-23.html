<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts self-deprecatingly joking about their lack of talent and poor ratings, followed by mocking a local news report on heavy rain and its commentary on *Piranha 3D*.  A significant portion focused on their ongoing feud with Keith Olbermann, fueled by a video of Ann Coulter criticizing him that they had posted.  Insults and mockery of Olbermann’s ratings ensued.  The conversation then shifted to their experience at Ozzfest, detailing encounters with Motley Crue, Rob Halford, and Ozzy Osbourne, highlighting their backstage access and Kenny's surprisingly subdued and unusual behavior (eating only one dessert per week, lack of visible enjoyment, and an amusing anecdote about his driving).  Kenny's apparent emotional detachment and peculiar habits were a recurring theme.  Stories about their own cars and driving experiences, including a speeding ticket photo incident, were shared, leading to a discussion about toll booths, E-ZPass, traffic frustrations, and the annoyance of drivers without E-ZPasses. The show included videos of plane landings in St. Martin, showcasing the close proximity of planes to the beach and road, and a video of a plane landing in heavy crosswinds.  A health update concerning Ronnie B's (Ronnie Bennington) apparent appendix rupture was given, along with a humorous misunderstanding regarding his identity between a host and a guest.  The discussion also mentioned a video featuring Ira, a colleague.

The show continued with listener calls, focusing on a missing intern, health updates on Bonnie B. and Ronnie B., and Julian McCullough's burst appendix.  Lee from Virginia recounted a skydiving incident involving a propeller, and Rich from Staten Island described the intense plane landings in St. Martin.  Further calls detailed short runways in St. Thomas and other challenging airport landings, including the supposedly dangerous Mount Everest airport.  The hosts discussed upcoming vacations and work schedules, with Opie expressing frustration over his employer's personal day policy.  Crude jokes involving Rob Halford followed. A large segment was dedicated to a "Top 5 Gulf Oil Spill Songs" contest, featuring scathing and often vulgar commentary on the entries, riddled with homophobic, racist, and misogynistic remarks.  The hosts debated the actual environmental impact of the Gulf Oil Spill, with differing opinions on its severity and the total volume of water in the Gulf.

Comedian Patrice O'Neal joined the show.  The discussion initially focused on the Gulf Oil Spill, using highly exaggerated and profane language.  The conversation quickly veered into the insignificance of humanity in the vastness of time and space, using hyperbolic and vulgar language, and included scenarios of hostile extraterrestrial contact, interspersed with racist and misogynistic jokes.  O'Neal promoted his upcoming shows, and a previous Lady Gaga bit he performed was revisited.  After a commercial break, O'Neal delivered a lengthy, sexually explicit stand-up routine about infidelity. The conversation then shifted to airport security, O'Neal expressing disdain for authority and TSA agents, using racial slurs and offensive stereotypes, recounting an encounter with a TSA agent.  The discussion extended to the proposed mosque near Ground Zero, with O'Neal and the hosts expressing their views using highly offensive and inflammatory language, racial slurs, and stereotypes. They debated the motivations behind the mosque and the potential for conflict.

A segment began with a hypothetical discussion about warning people of 9/11, transitioning to differing legal punishments across cultures, particularly Saudi Arabia and the US, and Amnesty International's intervention in a paralysis-for-paralysis case.  This sparked a humorous discussion about tiered paralysis punishments.  The conversation returned to the insensitivity surrounding the Ground Zero mosque.  A planned Bill Hicks clip was delayed due to the producer's incompetence. A story about a woman charged extra for a manicure due to her weight led to a lengthy, vulgar discussion filled with racist and sexist remarks about different ethnicities, particularly Asians.  Renee, a Korean adoptee, shared her experiences with mistreatment at Asian-owned businesses.  The discussion broadened to tipping cultures and racial stereotypes.  The conversation later involved a discussion of drinking habits and cultural differences between black and white people, featuring numerous sexually explicit and offensive comments, concluding with a discussion of the hosts' and a guest’s drinking preferences, including a particularly expensive cognac.

The final segment focused on a limited edition Sam Adams beer given to the hosts by Jim Cook. Initially believing it to be highly valuable (around $800), online research revealed its actual value to be around $10-$20. This led to much joking and frustration.  They debated whether it was a rare Millennium or a Triple Bach, involving listener calls and online searches.  An update about Ron Bennington's ruptured appendix was given by a nervous intern, Oscar, whose clothing was the subject of ribbing. The segment concluded with further jokes about race and a goodbye to the interns.  A call from Bill, a former liquor store owner, offered insight into the Sam Adams beers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  We have low self-esteem as a show.  They are not doing anything.  They're not highly skilled.  They have no talent.  We're just exploiting people.  See, kids, smoke your pod, play your video games, and watch TV.  You'll be better off when you get our age.  There's no ratings here.  No one cares.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do it.  Oh, that's low, Troy.  E-Rock, who's on the board?  Let's turn that up.  Let's get an energy going.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, that's better.  Opie and Anthony, good morning.  Hi, everybody.  Heavy rains in New York City.  Watch out.  My God, man.  Yeah.  Long Island got pummeled last night.  Yeah.  Pummeled.  That's what happens with rain, though.  I know.  It's thundery.  The news is reporting it like it actually, and I mean actually, rained cats and dogs, and  they had to get their crews out.  You're not going to believe this, but it actually rained cats and dogs overnight.  We got to get footage. 
[00:01:30]  They were in front of some house.  Me and Ann were just watching this dumb local brud.  I guess some house got flooded out.  So they're at the house.  Yeah.  I mean, in a way, okay.  That could be cool.  I don't think it's news, but it could be kind of cool to see someone's life destroyed because  their basement flooded.  They're showing a puddle outside the house because they have nothing to show.  Yeah, and they showed raindrops hitting the puddle.  Right.  Wow.  And then they knew they had nothing, so they started zooming in on the front door of this  house. 
[00:02:00]  What a waste of time.  Why?  What a waste of fucking time.  That's the news, though.  It is the news.  Big waste of time.  And then they were talking about Piranha 3D, and one of the anchors actually said, I'm going  to go see that movie.  And the bubble-headed bleach blonde's like, an actual adult seeing Piranha 3D?  This is crazy.  I'm crazed by what you're saying.  Like, adults don't see dopey movies, you know? 
[00:02:30]  Oh, the news, man.  Oh, my God.  Tired of it.  Tired.  Every day we look at this crap.  This drivel.  Oh, speaking of the news, I don't know if you're on this, but Keith Overman's taking  shots at us, I guess.  What?  Because we posted Ann Coulter just beating the shit out of him about the mosque thing.  Yeah.  And he's taking shots.  I guess he made some kind of comment that this isn't the 90s anymore, like Opie and  Anthony Ann Coulter. 
[00:03:00]  And then he writes, World Trade Center?  What is this, the 90s?  Like, I didn't even get his slam.  World Trade Center, the 90s?  No.  If you could find the actual tweet, that would be terrific.  Something like that.  What is this, the 90s?  Like, I guess we haven't been popular since the 90s or something?  Oh, that must have been it.  We've had our best years in the 2000s.  And Olbermann is what?  You might have to go down.  I don't know.  His ratings, by the way, are in the shitter.  They are terrible, right?  Horrid.  And then he thinks I'm some kind of Fox News fanboy because of Van Coulter. 
[00:03:30]  And I'm like, I don't like any of these shows.  That's my stance.  I don't like any of you assholes.  Fuck him.  He's so desperate.  I don't like any of them.  He's got reeks of desperation.  He's a fucking, a self-hating liberal douche fuck.  Mm-hmm.  And the whole thing with the mosques.  Wow, he tweets a lot.  Yeah, he certainly does.  I thought I tweeted a lot.  Very lonely.  What the fuck?  Very, very lonely.  Olbermann is a battler with tweets. 
[00:04:00]  There we go.  I wrote game on because, you know, I guess he...  Wait, wait, wait.  All right, yeah, keep going.  No, yeah, yeah.  Was it...  Yeah, here it is.  Oh.  Colter responds to Olbermann.  Okay, so someone sent him the video.  And he writes,  World Trade Center mosque, sorry, OP question mark, Colter question mark,  World Trade Center mosque question mark, 
[00:04:30]  vaguely recall names from the 90s.  Can't place them.  What the fuck does that mean, you asshole?  I get it.  Ann Coulter, I mean, she hasn't been popular since the 90s.  I don't think so.  The World Trade Center area hasn't been popular since the 90s.  That didn't even happen until the 2000s, you dope.  What's he talking about?  He's very desperate.  He's very desperate for our viewers.  No one watches his show.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Get on that guy's bad side.  It's in the toilet.  He's a pit bull.  Oh, boy.  He's crazy.  So, watch out, Ann.  Watch out for him.  I've seen some of his statements on the mosque thing and everything.  He's just one of these fucking idiot, forgetful motherfuckers.  Yeah.  You can't remember that?  Sounds vaguely familiar?  Seems like you can't remember September 11th, 2001 either.  Douchebag.  What's his angle on this whole thing?  Oh, of course.  He wants fucking, you know, mosques everywhere. 
[00:05:30]  On every corner.  Right.  Because it's America?  He's taking that stance?  Because it's the opposite point of anybody that has any common sense.  But see, in America, there used to be this thing where we would, like, discuss stuff.  Oh, yeah, you can do this, but maybe you shouldn't do this would be a nice thing for everybody.  Remember those days?  In July.  I think we were, like, in kindergarten when that used to happen in this country,  where we actually sat down and tried to talk shit out and see what made sense instead of 
[00:06:00]  taking a point of view and just dying with your point of view without listening to the  other side whatsoever.  He's just an asshole.  It says here in July, a countdown with Keith Olbermann saw lowest viewership since April 2008.  His rating's just plummeting.  No one watches.  That whole channel just stinks on ice.  It's for what they criticize Fox News about and what CNN gets criticized about.  They are the worst.  I mean, just horrible as far as their bias goes. 
[00:06:30]  So shut up.  And then no one cares anyway because no one wants to listen to that drivel.  I just care about the tweet because I don't really understand his slam.  Yeah.  I don't really understand it at all, actually.  I don't know.  Yeah.  So anyway.  Asshole.  That's how we start today.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  How was everyone's weekend?  Good.  Good.  Great.  Were you at Ozzfest last night? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Kenny was tweeting these pictures and I'm thinking, oh, it looks like Jimmy and Kenny had a good  time at Ozzfest Saturday night, but it turns out these were live pictures being tweeted.  Last night, yeah.  Last night.  I have a couple of good pictures of Kenny.  Yeah.  At the beginning of the show and at the end of the show.  Because he's such a bundle of fun.  Right.  That's how I'll be tweeting.  Are you being sarcastic about bundle of fun?  No.  No.  No.  No.  He's almost the definition of joy. 
[00:07:30]  You can't get happier than him.  He just lights you up.  Does he even know where he was yesterday?  Like, can he comprehend that he was at Ozzfest?  No, I'm serious.  I've been in social situations with Kenny.  I've dragged him along to some things and you don't even know what he takes in.  It's like, what is he?  Like, what is he enjoying himself?  Like, what is he doing?  Like, what is he thinking about?  Like, can you comprehend you were at a concert last night?  I'm metal as fuck.  Did you say mental? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  No, metal.  M-E-D-D-L-E.  Yeah, I was backstage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had my horns up.  Yeah.  You did, huh?  Yeah.  Rocking.  Yeah.  Did you have your casual suit on for the concert or did you really dress down?  I was dressed up metal.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you have, like, a concert t-shirt on?  Yeah, everybody wears black.  Yeah.  What did you wear?  I had on a black shirt and jeans.  Did he?  Did he?  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Jimmy?  Casual Kenny.  Yeah, he was Casual Kenny.  Casual Kenny, nice.  I like it.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, I had the best seats.  We did have great seats.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was back, like, you know, 30 rows back, but that's fine because you're out of, there's  a pit and stuff down there.  That's perfect, actually.  And, uh, dead center stage.  Man.  Fucking great seats, man.  Wow, right on.  It was great.  The show was great.  Was it?  Yeah.  We only saw Halford, Motley Crue, and Ozzy, and they were all fucking...  Those were the last three?  Yeah, and...  Who else played it?  I don't even know. 
[00:09:00]  There was a second stage.  But we only came for the headliners because that's how I roll.  Yeah.  You roll in just in time for the headliners.  Yeah, yeah, you know, I was backstage, schmoozing.  Very cool.  So how was, uh, how was, like, the crew?  They were great.  Motley Crue.  They were really good, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, they sounded fucking, uh...  You remember Tom?  He was playing drums.  Yeah, which is unexpected.  Yeah.  What did you expect him to play?  I was surprised Vince sang as well. 
[00:09:30]  And what about, uh, Halford?  Any cock-sucking going on on stage?  I was hoping.  You kept raising your hand, hoping you would be picked for the grand finale?  Yeah.  Fucking Halford.  Right on, man.  Yeah, he was great, man.  I didn't even recognize most of the songs.  Because of his solo project, it was fucking great.  Yeah?  Yeah, really.  Usually I hate when I don't recognize the songs.  Oh, I would have wanted to hear some Priest, though.  Did he do any Priest songs?  Yeah, he did a little bit of it.  Non-Point. 
[00:10:00]  Uh...  Did I just listen to them do In the Air Tonight last night?  Really? Non-Point?  I know that sounds weird, but...  I don't know. Priest?  But E-Rock put together a whole, like, um, CD of cover songs.  Does Non-Point do In the Air Tonight?  Yeah, they do.  And they...  Oh, holy shit, and they were at OzFest?  Their fucking, uh, version of In the Air Tonight, very surprising, because they're a metal band.  Yeah.  Sorry, this just connects what I was doing with the OzFest, somehow.  Certainly. 
[00:10:30]  Because E-Rock put together a whole fucking cover CD for me.  Oh, he did?  Aw.  Cover songs.  That's nice.  Is that bad?  He made you a mixtape?  Yeah, a mixtape.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Do you want to play it?  I was just referencing it, that's all.  Yeah, it's there.  It's pretty cool, actually. 
[00:11:00]  It's kind of hard to fuck this song up in a remake.  You could kind of do some shit with it.  Very remakable song.  It's a reflection.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Looks like something's lighting up over there.  Oh, man.  A little disc next to me.  It's distracting.  So, Kenny said you guys, he only got like two hours sleep last night.  Yeah.  Long night for you guys, right?  Yeah, because the drive home, it's Camden, but we flew home.  Fuck, you had to go all the way down to Camden? 
[00:11:30]  It wasn't at the PNC or anything?  No.  Sharon said that they're not allowed to this year because there was a death there last year  or two deaths in the parking lot over the drinking.  Oh, right.  But they weren't allowed for whatever reason this year.  So, two assholes get, you know, they ruin it for everybody else.  Out of all the people that go.  That's always the case in this country.  One or two assholes ruin it for everyone.  Yep.  It was very frustrating.  How many people could do that?  You know, hang out in the parking lot before a show, get drunk, take care of themselves,  take care of their friends.  Yeah.  Or if some idiots can't do that, and then it's ruined for everyone. 
[00:12:00]  Yep.  It's fucking enraging.  That's what our country does, though.  They love doing that.  The knee jerk.  One fucking person ruins it for everyone.  Jerks.  So, they couldn't do PNC, so they had to go all the way down to Camden.  Camden.  And I think they did Hartford the night before.  It was a back-to-back night.  Isn't Camden a much...  And they're belly-to-belly.  A much more dangerous place to have OzFest.  Yeah.  Just getting in and out of that place.  Yeah, the venue...  I would imagine there's a lot more people dying going to and fro that show.  The venue is great, but it really is like going through Mogadishu.  It's a fucking scary town, man. 
[00:12:30]  It's a scary town.  Hey, he has a gun on it, and I'm scared.  Yeah, it's one wrong turn type show.  Oh.  Yeah, you listen to the GPS.  It was a good show, though, man.  I was very happy.  Very cool.  I was very happy.  That sounds fun.  I didn't even pester and try to see Ozzy.  Really?  What was I going to say?  Yeah.  Hi again?  Hi again?  Yeah, no.  What do I need?  He's doing a show.  Do you think if you did see him, he would know who you are?  That's why I didn't...  I started shouting for a second because we were standing backstage.  She looked...  You know, she had just walked in, and she just said, you know, she's alone. 
[00:13:00]  Gave me a hug, and I introduced her to my girlfriend, and she was going somewhere.  And I was like, I don't want to bother them.  It's like it's a fucking show night.  Back-to-back shows.  Leave the guy alone.  Right.  I'm not going to say, have a good one.  Thanks, man.  I have a feeling...  Break a leg.  Yeah.  It's like...  I have a feeling you were regretting that you didn't say hi to him.  I wasn't, actually.  Just how you're talking.  You're like, oh, man.  I wish I said hi.  Nah, I was okay, actually.  Because it's almost like my greed.  It's like, what do you want?  What do you want?  What are you looking for here?  You got... 
[00:13:30]  Video with...  I talked to him for an hour.  An hour of video, knee-to-knee, brought him on...  What do you want?  As far as celebrities go, you've done it all.  Your checklist is complete, right?  With most...  I've met all of my idols.  You got a picture with all of Black Sabbath.  Together, yeah.  You were able to introduce Ozzy at a show.  He's been on the radio show sitting...  Like, literally a foot away from you.  Yeah, you're right.  What else could you fucking do?  I did a one-hour one-on-one with a...  Yeah.  Just two guys locking eyes.  The only thing left to do is suck his dick.  Well, it's not an option. 
[00:14:00]  It's not an option.  Fucking Florentine.  His kid's balls are massive.  He's not kidding?  They're like my fist.  He's got a photo on the camera.  Why?  My kid's bag.  That's what it's...  What's with his kid's bag?  It's like his.  Oh, right.  There's no way that's not his kid.  He really has a big bag?  Based on the bag.  Florentine's bag.  I literally could pick that out of 10,000 bags. 
[00:14:30]  That's got to be Florentine's kid.  It's got to be this big.  I'm making a sign like my...  It's almost like my fist.  Like a rosin bag?  Yeah, that's what his balls look like.  Believe me, he's shot...  I've 20 years, I've seen him 300 times.  What's wrong with his balls?  I don't know.  It's like one giant dumb ball.  Is there some swelling going on?  Or is it just a...  It really is.  It looks like an injury.  That's how big his balls are?  Yeah.  And the kid, big balls.  The kid is...  It fucking...  It hurt in the big sack.  The coconut doesn't fall far from the tree.  That kid has got a fucking sack on him. 
[00:15:00]  No shit.  Yeah.  Did he have a picture of what the kid looks like?  Really cute.  Yeah, yeah.  On his phone.  He goes, I'm that guy now.  And he's got the picture of the baby.  Oh, yeah.  Don't even look at my phone.  You cute kid.  I got easily 100 on my stupid phone.  Why not?  It would be hilarious if that's all he has, though, is a picture of the kid's ball bag.  Just his balls.  Let me show you my kid.  It's all...  Unfortunately, you can't...  There's no way to show a child scrotum publicly.  No, it's a little...  It's just an amazingly...  And a crime.  No, it's not pornographic.  It's like a baby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just fucking sitting there, you know, fucking diapers on. 
[00:15:30]  It's a little giant ball sticking out.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  Good for Florentine.  That's wonderful.  I had a nice little trek back from Rhode Island.  Oh, you went and got your car, right?  I finally picked up the car.  Vroom, vroom.  A long-ass day that was for a Saturday.  You went back and forth?  From me.  It's like, oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had to, you know, take the train.  Take the choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  That's a good... 
[00:16:00]  Take that up there.  That's a good ride.  Amtrak.  Yeah, yeah.  Right up the fucking coast.  It's a nice view out the window.  View?  You were sleeping?  You were my eyelids, motherfucker.  I was, uh...  One thing good about the, um...  There's a little trick to the, uh, seats.  I don't know if it's just the first class of seller seats, but, uh...  If you take the seats right where they change direction, you know, they're back-to-back and  a belly-to-belly.  But, uh...  If you take those seats, they lean way the fuck back. 
[00:16:30]  Because you're not interfering with the person behind you.  Yeah.  So they're the ones that go way far back.  So I was able to kind of catch a little snooze.  And then I got up there.  Finally, you know, met the people that had my car for two fucking months.  And, uh...  Then he's like, yeah, the, uh...  The Mexicans are, uh, cleaning it.  You know?  They kind of wash it and everything real nice.  Right.  And I was like, well, they knew I was coming at, like, noon.  He goes, yeah, they cleaned the wrong red car. 
[00:17:00]  And they had to move my car to get to the wrong car to clean it.  So I sat there a while, and then, uh...  How long?  Like, 40 minutes of just sitting there.  I was like, why?  I don't believe the guy, actually.  I don't believe the guy.  I don't believe the guy.  I don't believe the guy.  Whatever.  Whatever.  All I know is I pulled that fucking thing out of the lot, and it's a monster.  Really?  It is a fucking monster now.  And, uh, drove it down 95. 
[00:17:30]  Uh, got a few open spots on the road where I was able to just floor it.  Mm.  And, um, ridiculous.  Just fucking ridiculous.  But for the most part, those cars are a waste of time, because you can't drive them anywhere around here.  Uh, yeah, you can drive them.  I know you have a couple roads.  Yeah, there's a few cool roads.  I know you got a couple roads.  And it's just fun to, uh.  But it's not like having one of those cars out west, man.  When it's just nothing but the open road.  But you can get, you know.  You get going a little bit.  You can get going.  Yeah.  Take a cruise out, out east. 
[00:18:00]  Uh, take a cruise down ocean.  Yeah.  And, um.  That's good.  Open it up.  But, uh, it was a lot of fun.  And then some guy on Twitter was just like, hey, uh, saw you on the expressway.  In the car.  Sounds nice.  And there's a picture of me zipping down the expressway from this guy's vehicle in the,  uh, he was in the HOV lane.  But, yeah.  He caught me.  Caught me driving.  That was me.  That's funny.  This guy's quick on the draw on his camera. 
[00:18:30]  Because I, I think I was going pretty fast.  That was before I made the right lane sweep.  You know what?  I gotta call you out.  You're not.  Oh, never mind.  Okay.  Never mind.  Never mind.  I see the minivan.  He wasn't going pretty fast.  Yeah, he's not going fast.  I was thinking it was your shot.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, he's, he's stuck behind the minivan.  You're ready to fucking just.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm stuck in a little bit of traffic.  You get that, that Sunday, LIE, the weather's kind of rainy traffic.  And I knew it.  Like I said, the second I get my car back, summer's over.  And it's just going to fucking pour rain. 
[00:19:00]  And that's what's expected.  And that's it.  Like the foreseeable future is just rain.  We had a great summer, I think.  I know.  I've been inside with a kid, but I, I've seen nothing but sunny skies outside my window.  Have you noticed there's been this offset in the seasons though?  Yeah, of course.  And when they start and end, like the summer started earlier than normal.  Right.  We started getting some warm weather and now it's, you know, the middle kind of middle August  still, I guess you'd consider it.  Getting a little closer to the end, but still the middle. 
[00:19:30]  This should be still like 90 degree weather.  Oh, you think it ends early?  It's starting to cool off.  We're getting some rain.  No, you're panicking.  I am panicking, but I'm noticing a trend.  This whole week is going to be in the 70s, maybe 80.  Yeah, it's going to be kind of a shitty week, but I see it the other way.  Summers are a little longer and they start, they start abruptly.  They start early, but I think they end early.  On the East Coast here in the New York area, we don't really have much of a spring.  Yeah, fuck spring.  The spring is like really quick and it goes right into summer. 
[00:20:00]  But I'm seeing...  That's the shift I see.  I think we're going to see an early end to summer.  Nah.  And you're going to see a very quick fall.  You're going to be rocking.  That's going to be into August.  You're going to be rocking your pool through September.  Believe me, I'll fucking lift the heater on again a couple of nights ago.  Came out to a pool that was 100 degrees.  Guys, the whole pool was a jacuzzi.  Oh, God.  It was fantastic, though.  Just jumping.  I was in the pool last night in the rain. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, that's the way to do it.  It's just pouring fucking rain.  The water's steaming.  Looked like an apocalypse.  Apocalypse now.  That's not even crazy.  That's cool.  Oh, it is.  Great.  I like going swimming in the ocean when it's like just pouring.  The only problem is it's hard to keep the rainwater out of your beer.  Like I had to put one of the rafts over my head and just kind of be in the nice warm water with my beer as the rain just hit the top of the raft.  By the way, I got, just if you want to go to Twitter, I tweeted the before and after photos of Kenny at the show. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  This was Kenny.  My girlfriend took these.  He did not pose for these.  Oh, really?  The first one's at the beginning of the show as Ozzy came out.  Wait, I'm trying to think what the pictures could possibly be.  It's just Kenny rocking.  The first one is the first one.  That's Kenny.  And in the fucking background, you can see Gus G, Ozzy's guitarist, on screen for a second.  Right.  And that's literally the opening of the show.  He's looking very intently at the stage.  It looks like a statue. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  And then what's the, he's probably the same pose, right?  Oh, my God.  At the end of the night.  That's Kenny.  It's the exact same face.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Exact same pose, exact same face, just different lighting on him.  Just a ghoul.  Yeah.  Wow, he just stood there.  Just a ghoul.  He stood there.  I don't know if he enjoys himself.  He likes being a statue.  He was probably standing there watching, going, I think I need new handles on my cabinets  at home.  Like, just thinking things.  We should enter him in, like, a morning zoo contest where you have to touch the car for, 
[00:22:00]  like, three days, or, you know what I mean?  Last person touching the car wins.  He would win all those contests.  Because nothing phases the guy.  We don't know what he enjoys.  I don't know what the guy enjoys.  I am Iron Man.  After all these years, I have no idea.  He just missed misery.  He doesn't enjoy clothes, because he dresses bland.  He eats bland.  He likes Twizzlers.  He loves Twizzlers.  That's Kenny.  One of Kenny's treats is we're on the road.  Kenny and I will share a bag of Twizzlers.  It's one of our little secret things.  Aren't they delicious?  Who doesn't like Twizzlers? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Not the cherry ones, though.  You can take the cherry ones and shove them up your asshole.  It's the strawberry.  The standard.  The strawberry.  The standard Twizzler.  Standard Twizzlers.  You know what?  Sometimes I like Twizzlers so much.  Three at a time.  You just take three at a time.  Grab it like a big fucking red licorice cock and just shove that in your mouth.  You eat them that way.  Like the full mine.  Oh, they're delicious.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what makes Kenny tick. 
[00:23:00]  I have no fucking idea.  I've tried to.  I know he likes to like splurge and eat a cookie like once a week or something.  He was telling me on the way home once.  A cookie?  Yeah.  Because I'm like, what do you do?  And then he was explaining his desserts that he likes, but only like once a week.  Really?  Yeah, I forgot.  I think it's cookies.  I think he likes a cookie once a week.  What kind of cookie?  That's very, you know, it's kind of vague.  We'll have to ask.  Chocolate chip.  Does he like a good oatmeal?  Yeah, we'll have to ask.  Does he like a...  Oatmeal raisin? 
[00:23:30]  Oatmeal raisin?  One of those butter cookies?  I don't know.  I don't know where he is.  I think he's...  I don't know.  He's getting some shit.  A Lorna Doon?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Does he like a good Lorna Doon?  I hate Lorna Doon.  What's a Lorna Doon?  It's like compressed sand.  They're like buttery fucking butter cookies.  Terrible.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they're awful Lorna Doon.  You don't like a good Lorna Doon?  I hate a Lorna Doon.  Keep them out of my house.  Yeah, that's...  They're sand. 
[00:24:00]  It's one of the worst cookies you could eat.  Oh, a little...  Oh, yeah.  A biscuit.  Biscuit.  Yeah, if you're gonna have a cookie, you gotta go all in.  Chocolate chip.  Peanut butter.  How about a good Peekfreen?  Do you want a Peekfreen?  Peekfreens are a very serious cookie.  Yes, they're very serious.  They're made for grown-ups.  Something...  The...  Peekfreens are a very serious cookie.  Remember that fucking horrible song?  They're not made for kids.  They're made for grown-ups. 
[00:24:30]  Uncle Paul never buys them because they can't entice the children.  I don't like Peekfreens.  They're too dry.  That Peekfreens song was...  Do you remember the song?  I really don't.  Peekfreens are a very serious cookie.  Is it possible to YouTube that?  They're made for grown-up taste.  I haven't heard...  Peekfreens are much too good to waste on children.  Oh, they're serious.  Very serious.  Fuck, you remember that?  That's crazy.  Is that the cookie that I want to dump pecan in it?  Ruining everything? 
[00:25:00]  No, they're like...  No, it's like sand.  That's another one.  Peekfreens are sandy cookies.  What about a nice ginger snap cookie?  I like a ginger snap.  Get the fuck out of here.  I like ginger snaps.  It's a special occasions.  Emma Sam's.  I quite agree.  From the 80s?  Yeah.  Happy anniversary, you two.  What are you saving your Peekfreens for?  No compromise.  That's why I choose new improved Breath Savers.  For fresh breath.  What?  It's Breath Savers.  It's just because it's...  Emma Sam's.  Emma Sam's in an old commercial. 
[00:25:30]  Emma Sam's from General Hospital.  Yep.  Yeah, the Peekfreens commercial was very annoying.  Oh, it's horrible.  I don't...  Nobody likes a serious cookie.  Ah, why?  It's serious.  Kenny would.  Yeah.  I only eat serious cookies.  Kenny is a Peekfreen.  Club Soda Peek...  That's his nickname.  It should be Peekfreen Kenny.  So he never smiled the entire concert or showed any type of enjoyment?  No. 
[00:26:00]  And he doesn't move either.  No.  He doesn't go to the bathroom.  Oh, move.  He doesn't...  I don't even like dance.  No.  No.  Move.  Anything.  Nothing.  He just stands there.  He doesn't get any refreshments for himself.  Nothing.  Nothing to eat.  Nothing.  He just stands there.  Like, we'll be out to eat or we had to grab Burger King last...  It's just like one of those things where we're all starving on the way home.  Just grab something.  You gotta grab something.  He...  Oh, that's a good picture.  He just won't have any.  I don't know why.  But to him, it's discipline.  You could not enjoy treats as much as he doesn't get them. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Kenny.  Yeah, especially knowing it's just, you know...  A quick thing on the way home.  A quick thing, a necessity.  It's not like he's eating it every day.  Yeah.  I understand he likes to eat well, but I think that is some fucked up shit in his head.  It has nothing to do with nutrition, by the way.  No.  Here he is.  Jesus.  Kenny, where are you?  I'm down the hall in Sam's office.  I'm too tired to walk down the hall.  Oh, I forgot.  He goes, I'm tired. 
[00:27:00]  I go, you're all right?  He goes, I'm all right now, but within two hours, I'll be asleep on my feet.  Yeah, he's tired today.  So you're just hanging out in the office today?  Yeah, I'm just enjoying the show.  It's very entertaining.  What an asshole.  He did this to me on Friday.  I posted the video, if you want to check it out.  I had to go pick up my sister at the airport, and Kenny drops me off in my house.  I jump in my car, and I head right to Newark Airport. 
[00:27:30]  So it turns out I happen to be three cars behind Kenny, I guess.  And I get to the tunnel, like, clear sailing, and out of nowhere, a truck decided needed to  go through the tunnel and got stuck.  Kenny got through.  He was three cars, four cars ahead of me.  He got through.  I got stuck for 20 minutes.  So he calls me, because I guess he saw me at a light.  I didn't even realize he was that close to me.  And so while I'm sitting there waiting for them to back this thing out of the tunnel,  he's just beating the shit out of me. 
[00:28:00]  Talking about how fast he's going.  He's got his easy pass.  I'm making good time.  I mean, he made it, and then two other cars made it, and then I'm stopped.  I was the cutoff car.  I was the first in line.  You couldn't get around.  No, a cop out of nowhere, you know, starts stopping everyone, and he stopped my car.  I was first in line.  You couldn't tell him, like, I got a emergency?  Honestly, then I'm just thinking, you know what, this will make a good video.  So I said, fuck, I don't need to talk.  Yeah, I felt really bad about that. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  This is exactly how he was talking, too, because I'm bitching and complaining, and he's like,  what'd you say?  I asked him to tell me a story or something.  He goes, I can't tell you a story because I'm concentrating on the road.  I'm going 65 miles an hour right now.  I'm going so fast.  He needs such a dick.  What an ass.  What a fucking asshole.  He got me good.  But, Kenny, we want to know your eating habits.  I was trying to tell these guys that every once in a while you enjoy a good cookie.  Yeah, I eat dessert once a week. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, once a week he'll allow himself dessert.  Oh, that's good.  And what will you eat once a week?  Maybe I'll have a Weight Watchers ice cream.  I've tried the Weight Watchers ice cream, by the way.  It sucks.  Is it bad?  Yeah.  It makes you want to have real ice cream.  No, chocolate, chocolate chip.  What's that?  Chocolate, oh.  Chocolate, chocolate chip.  Chocolate, chocolate chip.  And what cookies do you like?  You know, maybe a nice Milano. 
[00:29:30]  See?  Even his cookie choice is horrible.  A Milano.  Why Milanos?  Why not?  Why not?  We got punch-drunk Kenny today.  Yeah, he's sleepy.  Yeah.  I got a few tasks I have to take care of.  All right.  Can I get some coffee?  Sure, why not?  Sam, is he falling asleep in there?  What's he doing?  He's prepared.  He's going to go out.  He's going to park the cars.  Right. 
[00:30:00]  He's going to get his sandwich for breakfast.  Right.  He's going to eat his sandwich.  And then he's going to go to sleep.  I have to time my nap before the bosses get in.  He's honest.  I have to wake him up at 7.30 so he can go back down to the end of the hall and pretend  he was there the whole time.  Oh, God.  What a great life.  Yeah, I hang out down by the danger zone.  That's what it's called.  What?  You guys call that area the danger zone?  Why?  Not you guys.  Just Kenny. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, really?  And the hallway is the highway to the danger zone.  Right.  Like, you know, Top Gun.  Yeah.  Sam's office is the green zone.  Why?  Because he saw the movie Green Zone.  Oh.  He doesn't even know what he's talking about.  No.  And then, like, where the boss's offices are, that's uptown.  Uptown?  We've never...  We don't go uptown often, Kenny.  I know. 
[00:31:00]  He has so much free time, he just thinks of nicknames for everything.  It's dangerous to go uptown.  It sure is.  Nothing good comes from going uptown.  What was your favorite part of OzFest last night, Kenny?  Rob Halford's Cox.  See, he doesn't even know.  No, he didn't know what was happening.  So he has to make a joke, which is fine.  No, you know, Ozzy shoots people with a water gun.  He's been doing that for years, right? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  He didn't know that.  And he shows a video before the show, too.  Of what?  Like, pop culture.  Puts himself in very funny situations.  It was a great one.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He's been doing that since, like, the mid-90s.  Really?  Early 90s, yeah.  Kenny, did you understand that?  Yes, Jim explained it.  Jimmy just tweeted pictures of you before the show or early on in the show and at the  end of the show, and you had the exact same face. 
[00:32:00]  I only have one.  See, this is exhausting.  If I was so faced, I wouldn't be wearing this one.  See, all the jokes to hide the hurt.  Yeah.  Hide whatever the fuck is going on in his body, his monster body.  All right, Kenny.  All right, I'm going to get you coffee now.  Thanks, Kenny.  All right.  Have a good nap.  Goodbye.  All right.  Goodbye.  You were talking about how, you know, stuck in traffic and everything, and you had everything, 
[00:32:30]  your E-ZPass and all.  When I went to go get my car, the one thing I forgot was my E-ZPass.  Dude.  The reminder I got at the Throgs Neck Bridge when I am stuck and just watching the whole  middle section just cruising by me, and I'm in traffic that, like, was backed up a mile  because of cash.  Oh, was I mad at myself.  You know, I was late to the party with the E-ZPass. 
[00:33:00]  I really was.  I've only had an E-ZPass maybe two years now, I think.  Maybe a little longer.  I don't know.  I don't understand why there's so many people that still don't have an E-ZPass.  Still don't have it.  It was torture.  It doesn't really cost anything extra, right?  No.  It was torture.  Sitting in that fucking traffic, knowing that I would have been whizzing through there.  It had to be a good 20 minutes of wasted fucking time.  And it would have been just slowing down slightly.  Yeah.  If you had the E-ZPass, right?  Barely.  Oh, I get that thing, boom, right over the hood of the car. 
[00:33:30]  So there wasn't even, there were no lines at the E-ZPass.  None.  It was zipping right through, and I'm sitting there.  And what annoys the piss out of me also is, like, even though it's the cash lane, I haven't  used cash lanes in fucking years, I had everything ready, had my fucking $6, because it's a $5.50,  you know, toll, ready to get my two quarters back from the fucking piece of shit in the toll  booth.  And, uh...  Not going to get an argument from me on that one. 
[00:34:00]  No, I know.  What the fuck is wrong with those people?  And I pull up.  I barely had to stop.  Got my shit, and I'm off again.  And I'm just thinking, why is this taking so fucking long?  Are people paying with pennies?  Mm-hmm.  Are they, like, having a conversation with the guy?  Like, what is...  Mm-hmm.  What's the problem?  What's the big fucking tie-up?  Move!  What was it?  People are just idiots.  They don't know how to...  They don't have the money ready.  They...  They're...  I see them, like, sometimes they pull up to the booth, and they see them, like, through 
[00:34:30]  the back window, get up, and they're digging in their pocket.  It's like you had a fucking 20 minutes to wait on this god shit line.  Hey, get your shit together.  Have your fucking money ready, young...  They should have a sign that just says, get your shit together.  Yeah.  While you wait, get your shit together.  Get your shit together.  I want signs like that on the highway.  And then there's also the motherfuckers that get in the easy pass lane so they could zip  up, and then have to cut in to the cash lane, because they don't have easy pass, which  fucks everybody behind them.  Of course. 
[00:35:00]  Of course.  I'm all for cutting into traffic, but I do it in a way where I'll go, and I'll look  for a gap, and bam, I'm in.  I won't sit there and fuck, you know.  No, it's the mentality.  It's okay when you do it, meaning me, you, the person listening to my voice right now,  but if anyone else does the exact same thing you did, you want to kill them.  Oh, I won't do it in a cash lane.  I'm just talking about getting into traffic and shit like that.  I won't do it at a toll booth, because it's the worst thing you can do to the line.  You're fucking everyone in the line. 
[00:35:30]  But if you see that fucking toll booth line, mile, two miles long, you're going to figure  out how to squeeze in somehow.  I sat on it.  Just sat there, pissed that I forgot my fucking easy pass.  Oh.  You should have just fucking went through.  You can't in New York, because it's the gates.  Oh.  They got the gates.  If it was Jersey without gates, I'd have been through there in a fucking second.  Yeah, because then you could just say, I forgot my easy pass and...  Although I don't think I have one registered for the Mustang, so I probably would have gotten  a big fine or whatever. 
[00:36:00]  Well, of course.  Whatever.  Of course you would.  Yeah.  Don't forget about the $20 or whatever it is, service charge.  Yes, service charge.  To send out your fucking ticket.  To send out the ticket that you owed fucking $5.  $5?  I'm talking about on the Garden State Parkway.  What is it?  Oh, the 30-cent one?  It's like a $35, $50.  What is it?  I forget now, because I got the easy pass.  Yeah.  But every once in a while, I forget to put the easy pass on the dashboard, because they  make it so you don't even know you're going through the fucking toll anymore.  And they do that on purpose, because they want to catch it, because they know they can 
[00:36:30]  get even more revenue by fucking their customers.  Right.  Not regular people, their own fucking customers.  Yeah.  So you miss a $0.35 toll, let's say, and next thing you know, you've got a bill in the mail  for, I think it's like $50.  Yep.  And it's something like a $50 service charge.  $50 to mail out your fucking...  Who's getting paid $50 to fucking mail that out?  Nobody.  Dude, it's a racket.  Total racket.  It's bullshit.  Everything is.  All these government fucking bullshit. 
[00:37:00]  They're lining their pockets with our hard-earned money.  It's just a way for them to jack the fine up.  It's like everybody knows that.  It's like they're just stealing from you.  They're stealing.  That's like the surcharge is also one of those things.  Well, the fine is $25 with a $10 surcharge.  So the fine is $35.  Shut up.  No, but usually the surcharge is more than the actual fine.  That's what's even crazier.  And what's...  Eh, whatever.  We did it.  I was going to say it again. 
[00:37:30]  I mean, the fact is they're ripping off their own customers, though.  Yeah.  People that already have E-ZPass and, you know, forgot to put it up on the dashboard or something.  Someone wants to know how much fuel did you go through from Rhode Island to Long Island with the supercharge?  Yeah, that is pretty funny.  Yeah, that is pretty funny.  Engine thing.  I gassed up before I left, and I had to refuel before I got home.  Wow.  So it went through a full tank of gas and then some.  Wow.  And to go from my house to my mom's house yesterday, because they were having a little birthday party for a little Warren. 
[00:38:00]  Aw.  Yeah.  About a half a tank of gas.  Just to get out there?  Just to get out there, a few exits.  For people that don't know, it's not that far of a drive.  But I drive like a maniac with the thing, and now, I mean, the fuel just pours in.  They put, like, the oversized injectors and increase my supercharger boost from, like, it's more than double. 
[00:38:30]  Wow.  It was nine pounds into the supercharger, and now it's, like, just about 20 pounds of boost when I hit that fucking thing.  God damn.  You hear, it sounds like LaGuardia, and you just fucking get smashed into your seat.  It's fantastic.  Speaking of LaGuardia and all that, I got on a kick yesterday of some videos I found.  Did you see the, you see the, everyone's saying it's an old video. 
[00:39:00]  I never saw it before, though.  The plane's landing in St. Martin or whatever it is.  I watched your tweet of it.  It was fucking unbelievable.  Yeah, those are cool.  But you see the other video, I didn't tweet it, where people actually hold on to the fence when the planes.  Yeah, yeah, and they get blown back.  Oh, you've seen these videos before?  I'm late to this one.  But I guess people hold on to the fence.  Yeah, here's the video.  I tweeted yesterday.  This is amazing.  747 comes in right over the water.  You could jump up and hit the wheels of this thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely good.  And some asshole has to, the fucking troublemakers on Twitter, fake, so fake. 
[00:39:30]  And there's a million people that have actually seen this.  It's actually not fake.  And they hang out on the beach just to check this out.  Look at that.  This is something you check out when you're down there.  How fucking cool is that?  How is that normal?  Why wouldn't they shut that road down?  I Twittered that.  I'm Twitter.  I freeze-framed that to see if it was fake.  It sounds like somebody might have just done that.  No, a million people got a hold of me and said,  Oh, yeah, when you go down there,  this is one of the things you do as a touristy thing is check out the plane's landing. 
[00:40:00]  Did you see the ten closest, the ten best flybys?  Well, that's the one I tweeted, too.  That was great.  This shit is insane.  Oh, it's right over their heads.  And the blast they get hit with.  Yeah, but you guys, the plane's taken off where they hold on to the,  they call it fence surfing or something like that.  Yeah, they hold on to the fence.  They don't actually have their legs up in the air,  but, I mean, it's close, though.  They've got to hold on pretty good.  One guy let go of the fence and he just starts rolling down the beach. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  It is amazing.  They come in right over the water, right over that highway.  Well, they do that at LaGuardia, don't they?  Well, these are 747s also, and they have to hit the beginning of the runway.  Unbelievable.  Because that's a long rollout for those fucking things.  Yeah, then it led to the top ten flybys that someone put together.  I also tweeted this if you want to go to my Twitter.  It's amazing.  Yeah, but they fucked it up with a Top Gun clip to start it off.  You didn't need that shit.  You just zipped through the Top Gun clip. 
[00:41:00]  There's one guy that, did you see the guy that ducked?  No, I'm thinking of the guy that just stood there while the fucking,  Oh, yeah, that guy had balls.  But there was another guy that was trying to stand there as they were going for this,  and he had to duck.  He couldn't handle it.  Wow.  Look at these planes just fucking, the wheels were basically tapping him on the head.  That would look so, I would love to stand there and see that.  Of course.  How high up is that literally?  It's probably 20 feet in the air, right?  It's got to be.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like you could touch it.  It ended a touchdown. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, not much more.  Go down a little further.  You probably couldn't touch it, but it looks like you could.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then the top, the top 10 low pass flyby.  They had to do a top gun.  You didn't, they didn't have to do this.  I agree.  Because what they put together is just fucking amazing.  Low pass flybys.  Go to my Twitter, OP Radio, if you haven't checked this out.  They're just showing you 10 right off the ground.  F-18 just flying on, wingtip to the ground. 
[00:42:00]  It's amazing.  Those are so fast.  How we made things that went so fast.  I know.  It's astounding.  Number eight.  Oh, F-16.  That's fantastic.  That's nothing, Ant.  It's just astounding.  We're just doing this for Anthony.  You've got to see the one.  Oh, this is great, yeah.  That guy's maybe 15, 20 feet off the water.  And then he just goes ballistic. 
[00:42:30]  Straight up.  Straight up in the water.  Just goes nuts.  It's a blue angel.  Oh, this goes fast.  All right, we'll get to it.  Look at this guy.  Number five.  This is the guy that ducks.  He can't take it.  Look how fast this plane comes up on him.  It's a plane.  It's like someone threw a Frisbee at him, but it's a fucking plane.  That couldn't have been more than, what, 10 feet over his head?  Amazing.  We're just getting to the one where this guy has fucking balls.  What brass balls these guys have.  Right.  You know how fun that has to be? 
[00:43:00]  These guys are about 15 feet off the ground.  That right there is 15 feet off the ground, and he's got to be doing 60 miles an hour.  He's got to be.  So rude.  Oh, God.  Number three.  This guy is fucking out of his mind.  He's standing in the middle of the runway.  Just staring at the plane coming at him.  Oh, damn.  Even the cameraman, like, moves.  And he just turns around and gives the thumbs up.  Gives two thumbs up like that.  That was cool.  Now I'll go clean the shit out of my pants.  Dude, look at how fucking close this is. 
[00:43:30]  And this is number three.  How close is this?  Holy fuck.  It had to be 10, 15 feet over his head.  If that.  It was less than 10 feet.  I like how he just gives that thumbs up.  I would put a tall hat on and see if the plane could knock it off.  Oh, man.  They're laughing in the desert.  What is that?  It's like a refueler.  Yeah.  And it's about 20 feet off the ground.  And then number one over the water.  Look at that. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  This guy's over the water.  He's sucked water up right off the back of his plane.  Where is this?  On your Twitter?  Yeah.  Then there's another one.  Actually, there is one I want to play for you that's also on my Twitter of a landing.  And a lot of people are saying that's fake.  And I couldn't tell.  What?  It's, uh...  God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cool shit out there.  Tell me if this is fake.  Look at this fucking plane coming in for a landing sideways. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, the wind blowing this one?  Yeah.  This is wind blowing.  This is not fake.  I think this is in, uh...  So, the plane is...  How do you explain it?  It's...  It's...  The left wing is almost...  It's being blown back and forth.  More forward than the nose.  Yeah, it's horrible wind.  Heavy crosswind.  Yeah.  So, he's got to crab it into the wind.  Yeah.  When he lands.  And then at the last minute, you straighten it out.  So, the plane is like...  And you touch down.  He doesn't even land.  Oh, he blows it off.  Did this one land or no? 
[00:45:00]  No, watch.  I think the wing tip touches or something.  He's trying to land.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got to fucking abort that.  He aborted.  Oh, shit.  Is that real?  Yes, of course.  Yeah, that's got to be real, huh?  Yeah, that was just some really horrible crosswind.  That's a bad crosswind.  And it goes back up.  How horrifying is it if the wind is so bad you're getting blown around and then you have  to come around again and do it?  And do it again.  Here, you were horrified the first time.  Yeah, let's...  Now, let's do it again and see if you fucking make it.  Yeah, man.  Did he touch the ground? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, he was coming in sort of like two o'clock, if that makes sense, right?  Yeah, your nose was sort of two o'clock.  Your nose is a few degrees off of the line of the runway.  And then the left wing dips and it looks like it touched the runway.  The wind's actually blowing you the other way.  If you came in straight, you would get blown off the side of the runway.  Yeah.  So they crab it into the wind.  Fuck.  Insanity.  The other thing, before we go to break, after Friday's show.  Wow.  I did a quick video with Ira, because everyone wants to know what Ira looks like. 
[00:46:00]  Yes!  And Anthony doing his Ira impression.  Ira!  The video came out pretty well, man.  Yeah, that was...  And you can check out the fellatio queen and what she looks like.  Oh, Jesus.  That old brood.  That old bag, blowjob bag.  She wanted dick.  She wanted some cack.  She was looking around going, who's going to give me dick?  And we all had our heads down.  No, no, no, no, not for me.  No, no, no. 
[00:46:30]  Sorry, a little busy.  Sorry.  Sorry.  So sorry.  But if you want to check out what Ira looks like, that's on our YouTube channel.  Put it on your website.  Yeah.  That's going to be a catchphrase for a while.  He was really fucking funny.  Ira rules.  What's the story with Ronnie B?  I only heard late last night, but I guess his appendix ruptured.  Wow.  What?  I think.  Is anyone talking on here?  If that's what it is.  That's crazy.  I got my info from a fucking listener.  So does anyone around here know exactly what's going on? 
[00:47:00]  I mean, no offense to the listener.  It sounds like he's in the know, but I tried to get some info from people.  No one knows.  I know.  So how does a listener know?  I even called up Davey Mack, figuring he would know, and he didn't know any more than  I did.  Yeah.  Oscar, do you know what happened to Ronnie B?  Oh, sweetie.  What?  What?  I don't know who he is.  Wait, what?  What are you doing?  Over here, man.  Wait, grab a mic.  And why are you so sweaty?  No, no.  It's raining outside, so I don't have an umbrella. 
[00:47:30]  You got my coffee in the rain?  Oh, no.  It's here.  We know it's here.  Yeah.  No, I suppose it's here.  You're soaked over coffee.  That's right.  It's no biggie.  I mean, water was not going to hurt me or anything.  I would lose an Oscar, by the way.  I know.  Who's Bonnie B?  Who is he?  No.  Ronnie B.  Ronnie Bennington.  Bennington.  Oh, no.  I didn't hear.  No, no.  I know.  Okay, I know.  No, I don't know what happened.  From Ron and Fess.  Yeah, yeah, no.  Okay, now it's...  I just know how much Ron and Fess. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, but yeah.  Okay, why?  You called him Bonnie B.  Bonnie B.  Why would there be a Bonnie B?  I don't pay close attention to detail sometimes, so like, I don't know.  Yeah, but there's only...  Like gender?  Exactly.  Yeah.  There's only two shows here.  Yeah, yeah.  Us and them, basically.  So you don't know who Ronnie B is?  Yeah, no, not now.  No, yeah.  I was just...  I was going to say, I'm a little deaf out of this ear, from like years of just...  Left ear?  Yeah, right here, this one, yeah.  Why?  What happened to your left ear?  No, I guess it was from all the years of playing with the band.  From bands? 
[00:48:30]  From the shows.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Do you know what happened to Ronnie B?  Mm-mm.  All right, I want you to find out and give us...  Yeah, get us information.  That's like a mission for you.  Okay.  And right after the break.  All right, so great.  Right after the break.  Give me my fucking coffee.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He does the show after we do.  Yeah.  So find out what happened.  Do some research.  There's rainwater in this.  Oh, no, I put the napkin on top of this.  See ya, it's rainwater.  No, that's...  You don't know how to use a microphone? 
[00:49:00]  Oh, okay.  I had a napkin on top of it.  I was making sure there was no...  Why are we losing this guy?  No.  Why aren't you staying here?  No, I have to play with you.  I have to go back to school.  Where do you go to school?  Moncler State University.  So why can't you do a little interning like one day a week?  No.  Oh, the thing is just my schedule with work and class, they fit now.  So trying to fit another thing is just trying to put like a 10-pound bag into like...  No, 10 pounds of sugar into a 5-pound bag.  I was thinking shit.  Yeah.  That too. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, that too.  Wow.  But don't you think this is important if you want to be in this business?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, we can probably arrange something.  You know, I'll stop buying something.  We want you around a little longer.  We just discovered you, unfortunately, a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, we should have been exploiting you for months.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go find out what happened to Bonnie B.  And also Ronnie B.  Yeah.  You know Julian McCullough, the comedian?  Yeah, I know the name.  His appendix just burst.  Really?  And he was in the hospital for a few days, but he's out now.  So it's like, it's bad for you as an adult, but you can be... 
[00:50:00]  It's really bad.  As long as you catch it, like, really quick.  Well, after...  That'll purrs in your system.  Oscar just ran, so he'll get the info and we'll get the update on Ronnie B.  He threw Oscar next.  I want to know if he's okay and wish him all the best.  That's a fucking...  Hopefully there's no death to report tonight as I host Red Eye.  Oh, very nice.  And I am a guest on that very show.  Not if I can help it.  I've been lobbying to have you thrown off.  I don't like your potty mouth.  Let's see. 
[00:50:30]  Goddamn, man.  I knew someone who got killed by...  Get the fuck out of here.  We'll find plane.  Lee in Virginia.  Lee?  How you doing, boys?  Hey, brother.  Hello.  All right.  So I skydived.  And there's a lot of shenanigans that happen with the jump pilots because they get a little  tired of just going up, flying around, and then coming back down.  So the one started to do rope-wise of the actual runway, and people were lining up along the 
[00:51:00]  runway.  He, on one of his passes, got a little too far to the left and clipped one of the other  people with his propeller.  Ow.  He clipped a person standing there?  Yeah.  He.  That can't be good, huh?  What happened?  They get hurt?  You can't get clipped with a propeller and then just go, oh, it was a flesh wound.  Sure.  Well, he almost killed himself because it took him about an hour to talk him down over  the radio. 
[00:51:30]  You know what I mean?  He just kind of went silent, and they had to talk him down for a long, long time.  Right.  Yeah.  Like the beginning of Top Gun.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that what you're describing?  Yeah.  Well, Randy Rose, that's how he died, right, Jimmy?  To bring it right back to us.  Trying to fucking show off.  The pilot was, the bus driver was an amateur pilot, I think, and Randy and Sharon's friend  Rachel, Randy hated flying.  They got on a plane with a guy, and he was doing flybys to the bus, and the wing clipped 
[00:52:00]  the tour bus.  Ozzy was sleeping on the bus, so it's, you know, I'm surprised him and Sharon are still  alive, but yeah, Randy.  Yeah, because they could easily hit the bus.  Smashed into the bus, yeah.  And that was it for Randy.  Yeah.  Brings it right back to the beginning of the show.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  And then this guy goes down to St. Martin every year.  Rich in Staten Island.  Lucky him.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Yeah, man.  It's a real deal.  I go down every year.  I got a timeshare there.  Yeah, so you've seen the planes landing. 
[00:52:30]  Literally, they go, you can almost touch them as they're over your head, right?  Yeah, they're coming right over your head.  The best part is when they take off.  It's like getting sandblasted.  I laugh at people.  I go sit in my rent-a-car, and I watch the planes and the planes take off.  All the thrust blows the sand in these people's faces.  Yeah, they think it's going to be cool, but, I mean, sand is not fun when it starts blowing  around, man.  Yeah, no.  It was just running for cover and hiding.  It's a good thing.  It was cool with a lot of them bought on there. 
[00:53:00]  Girls drink for free.  Bikini beach ball.  It's a cool island.  Same one.  The prosecution's legal there, too.  There you go.  They have legal brothels there.  All right.  The pastor comes every Monday, checks the girls out.  It's a good thing, Jimmy.  You love it.  I don't go for that type of stuff.  Jimmy doesn't like going on vacation to places that are exotic.  Exactly.  He hates it.  I want to go on vacation wherever Bill Ward is.  That's where I want a vacation, to Bill Ward's house.  Just hang out with him.  Hi, Bill.  I'm here for a week.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Can you imagine?  I'd love to go on vacation with Bill Ward.  Would you?  Yeah, I don't know where I'd want to go.  Wherever Bill wanted to go, I'd go and just hang out and have coffee every day and talk  on fucking Sabbath.  Oh, he'd be so annoyed.  All he'd want to do is relax with his family, get laid.  He probably would think it's cool for the first maybe two hours.  You might be able to get a dinner in, and then by the next morning, he's done with little  Jimmy Norton.  Bill likes me.  He's a very sweet guy, but I would bring out the ugly side of Bill Ward in a week.  Just my eager face would sicken him every morning.  Right. 
[00:54:00]  Knock on his door.  Hey, Bill, you up?  8 a.m., more Sabbath questions.  Oh, God.  I didn't sleep too well, Jim.  Fucking 8.50, I'm calling him.  You all right?  Would you just be in your hotel room coming up with questions all night long?  It's all I'd be doing.  We'd go out to dinner.  We'd go out to breakfast, and this is what he'd hear.  I'd pull out papers and he'd hear.  Okay.  Like the straightening of papers, knowing there was a bunch of questions.  So on Tour 76, I would just interview him.  Oh, he wouldn't have a moment's peace. 
[00:54:30]  I don't think he wants a question about Tour 76 ever.  He'd be trying to cut into his eggs.  Right.  Rich in Philly.  Rich.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Oh, have you ever flown into St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands?  I do a lot of Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands, where else?  St. Thomas, you fly in, and there's a giant mountain at the end of the runway.  Get the fuck out of here.  You fly in and have to screech on the brakes like you're coming up on a red light you didn't see. 
[00:55:00]  They come in, and you can hear it.  I can just sit in the mountain coming closer.  Back when they used to have some of those flights, I think Delta had it.  We could watch the camera out of the cockpit.  Yeah.  Every one of those on the little TV screens back when they used to do that.  But you used to see the mountain just coming, coming, coming, stop.  And it was right in front of you.  It was like, I'm sure we're going to be fine.  And it was a short runway like LaGuardia.  So it was like it was just water, water, runway, stop.  LaGuardia is a scary airport in the New York area.  But they're not bringing 747s into LaGuardia. 
[00:55:30]  This one, that's why they touched down the second they clear that fence.  Because they need all the wheels to slow the plane down, right?  Yeah.  Because all these tiny little islands used to take smaller planes in.  And then they decided, no, we could get these big fucking planes in.  Give it a shot.  But we're going to need some pilots with some fucking years behind them.  Some skills.  Big mountain right at the end of the runway.  Really?  I've got to check that out.  I haven't seen that yet.  Thank you, Rich.  I appreciate it.  Morning, boss.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, because you're flying to these little islands.  Yeah.  How the fuck are they going to land this thing?  You see it from the sky, the tiny little runway, right?  I've only been to that island from cruise ship.  St. Thomas?  Yeah.  Is it nice down there?  So it's, oh, yeah.  They got a nice town?  I do.  We got a little beach community thing going on there.  I like a nice little town.  Wow, that is a fucked little runway they're carved out of this island.  All right.  So that's a small plane.  This is St. Thomas? 
[00:56:30]  I'm not sure.  It says world's smallest runway, shortest runway.  I was watching something on the short runways, the hardest runways to land at.  Oh, I saw that, yeah.  And fucking Everest.  The one on Mount Everest is the worst.  What?  There's a runway on Mount Everest, like 9,000 feet up, I think.  What?  And look at this fucking runway.  I know it's radio.  Sorry.  Shortest runway in the world.  Check it out on YouTube.  He actually has to turn the plane to the right a little bit.  Cliff into the ocean.  That is a poorly designed runway. 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  He stopped maybe what?  He was right at the end of it, and then he turned around.  Yeah.  There you go.  Just showing how short it is, I guess.  Mount Everest has one.  They do, yeah.  It's the little planes you take up there, and it's horrifying.  Mount Everest Airport.  The hell is that?  It's a drawing of a big, fat fucking plane landing.  Futuristic Airbus of the future.  That's something.  I don't know.  I like a nice, long runway. 
[00:57:30]  It's like going to Vegas.  Kennedy.  Vegas rules.  They start landing the plane, I don't know, a thousand miles away.  Yeah, that's another thing.  When you land in places like Vegas.  Oh, it rules.  The approach is straight and long.  Straight as an arrow forever.  Nothing there.  Nothing.  You start descending right over Philly, and it's a straight shot.  Right, right.  Great.  LaGuardia, man, they do some crazy bend over the Long Island Expressway.  Yeah.  And then shoot you down to the runway.  It's horrifying as far as the New York airports go. 
[00:58:00]  This one you're landing, the runway actually goes up at a pretty steep angle, because this  way it slows you down a little when you're going up.  People walk on the runway to get to work or whatever, so they have to tell people there's  a plane coming to get off the runway.  It's really awful.  Savages.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, all right.  Fucking runway on a mountain.  Yeah, that's...  I was just about to say I would never land on that one.  Like, that's not implied.  9,000 feet up, meaning you're going to hike to the top of a mountain.  That's a scary hike. 
[00:58:30]  Whoa.  And you take off right off the cliff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like a hang glider.  There's no aborted fucking takeoffs.  You don't think takeoffs.  No, you're abort ever?  No.  You're going right into a ravine.  Right.  All right, enough.  Scary monsters.  All that shit's online for your viewing pleasure.  Well, History Channel had the top 10 worst airports.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was a good show.  I watched it a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  All right.  Brakey?  Yes, because mm-mm has to eat. 
[00:59:00]  Who?  Anthony?  Mm-mm, got to eat.  Call the Open Anthony Show.  866-866-WOW-1.  That's 866-969-1969.  Give me the copy and I'll whale it out.  All right.  Okay.  Are we rolling?  Hi, everybody.  This is Rob Halford, the Metal God, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  And after midnight, rockin' to the door, love until the morning, I'm gone, I'm gone. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Love until the morning, then he's got to wash the shit off his dick.  Wow.  And he's gone.  Wow.  He's gone.  Well.  Shit dick.  It just shows you how talented the guy is, that his fans didn't turn their backs on him.  Well, they were afraid.  Don't turn your back on Rob Halford.  Man, Halford. 
[01:00:00]  Fucking Halford.  Damn, damn, damn.  Opie and Anthony, Monday.  Got a week here.  Then we go on vacation.  Hmm.  Then we'll see what happens after that, I guess.  Got a real long fucking week.  Yep.  That's what happens.  So bear with us.  Pre-vacation week is very long.  We're driving in today, I'm like, I don't know.  We have great fucking gigs, but I was thinking, ah, it's going to be a long week, just like  you said.  Long week. 
[01:00:30]  Ah.  Well, a nice fucking vacation's always fun.  Yes.  We don't get a lot, so, quite frankly.  Ooh, that's good.  No, we really don't get a lot.  Because I have to do something, so I was looking for, like, a personal day, and they're  like, yeah, you used all your personal days up.  I'm like, really?  You know what kind of fucking work schedule half these people have around here?  You used up all your personal days?  Yeah.  We can't take any more personal days.  Yes, they told me that. 
[01:01:00]  I remember the old days, you just, whenever you needed a day, they'd give it to you.  Right.  It didn't matter.  They didn't keep tabs on it.  You didn't take advantage of it.  But I was the stupid one that actually asked.  I don't know why I did that to myself.  I was thinking, I need to take a day, because I had some stuff I have to do.  So I was dumb enough to ask the idiots down the hall, how many days do I have left between  now and the end of the contract?  They're like, oh, counting the vacation you're taking, you've taken all your days for the 
[01:01:30]  year.  I'm going to look around this place.  Half these studios are empty half the fucking time.  Where are those people?  Just take a day.  Who cares?  And who are their fucking agents that they got that great deal going?  Just take a day.  Who cares?  Yeah, right.  If you have to take a day, you've got to take one.  All right.  See you later.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, I mean, it's not a big deal.  All right, take it easy.  I'm out of here.  It's just the principle, though.  They actually know you took all your days.  Not you took all your days technically, but don't worry about it. 
[01:02:00]  That's what they should have said.  This is the first place I've ever worked where they kept track of that.  Right.  Because you just never, if you needed a day, you took it.  Yeah.  I mean, if you took three days in a row and were doing that every month or something like  that, they would probably say something.  Do they count my sick days?  Because I really was sick.  I know I had a kid this year, so I took more days than usual in the past years. 
[01:02:30]  But I think I'm still way down as far as taking days off compared to just, let's say, other  people.  Because it is more than one person, by the way.  Because a lot of people are thinking of the person I'm thinking of.  But besides him, there's other people around here that have a really nice, light fucking  schedule.  I don't care if every motherfucker in this place does eight hours a year.  Fuck everybody in here.  You should just take a day.  They ain't going to say shit to you.  What are they going to say?  If they say anything, go, I'm Opie.  I kind of needed it more last week because now we're close to vacation. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway.  I fucking hope Bill Ward can make it, man.  What are you talking about?  My vacation plans.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Are you doing anything on vacation?  I'm doing opening.  I know Ant's doing something.  I'm doing something.  Are you doing anything?  I got opening day thing for the Tonight Show.  I'm going on opening day in New Orleans.  And I fly out that night to go pitch to do it the next week.  We were doing it the day after.  That's very cool.  So I have that, and I might stay in L.A. for a few days, but nothing planned.  Do you get into preseason football?  Care less. 
[01:03:30]  Same with me.  Don't care less.  Saturday night, the Jets were playing, and I tweeted that it was one of those lazy fucking nights trying to find something on TV.  So I ended up watching Lock Up.  Or is it Lock Down?  I always forget.  Lock Up.  Lock Up.  Yeah.  Where are they now type shit.  And it turns out half these guys just end up back in the joints.  Of course.  They're falling off roofs.  They're breaking their backs.  And then I was watching the History of the Hillbilly.  What else did I tweet?  I forgot what the other thing was.  The History of the Hillbilly.  Actually, I was watching History of the Hillbilly. 
[01:04:00]  So someone was like, oh, some Jets fan you are.  You're not watching the Jets?  It's pre-fucking season.  Who cares?  I really don't care.  No one.  I wouldn't even say no one.  No, no.  Even hardcore fans, though, are like, you know, it's fucking preseason.  Kids are shit.  I know a lot of, you know, fans love the preseason as well.  I just can't get into it.  Oh, man.  And going to a preseason game?  Why? 
[01:04:30]  Get stuck in traffic for a game that doesn't matter?  For that.  Can we read that?  Or no?  Well, no.  Why bother?  It's just amazing, though.  It's just out of amazement I just want to read that.  It's just.  If you say no, that's fine.  I'm just.  It's just amazing.  Everyone's all fucking touchy.  Really?  Yeah, of course they are.  To touchy over that?  What if we say.  What if we say this is what we wish we had?  Then how could you be touchy over that? 
[01:05:00]  I don't know.  It's just.  It's just amazing to me.  It's amazing.  Honestly.  Yeah.  I don't care.  It's like.  It's like watching a guy fuck a hotter chick than me.  Yeah.  But you should care.  Yeah.  Because we get.  We get.  We get fucked left and right.  It's.  We should have a.  You know.  That.  All right.  If the Red Sox got a better fucking pitcher than the Yankees.  A little.  You can only blame the fucking Yankees management for not getting a good pitcher.  A little of you should care.  Just a little bit.  Not even.  Not even.  Somebody being in the right place at the right time. 
[01:05:30]  That's all it is.  I was.  It was more of a God bless him.  Because I didn't realize how great it was.  Or is.  All right.  Lou Piniella.  Ah, Lou.  I got to tell you.  Lou Piniella crying his eyes out.  We love the crying athlete.  The crying manager.  All that shit.  It's not that great.  You got.  You need the video.  Yeah.  The video.  Just playing the audio.  It's not that bad. 
[01:06:00]  But you see the video.  It's pretty bad.  Yeah.  Because he's like scrunching his eyes shut.  Keep from crying.  The Lou Piniella thing's weird.  Like he's retiring.  He doesn't even want to finish the year.  He's saying he's going home to his sick mom.  Yeah.  But how old is she?  I guess that made him a little emotional.  How old is Lou Piniella's mom?  Does anyone know the back story on the mom?  No.  And what kind of sickness she has that he couldn't finish the season?  Yeah.  Or is it just an excuse to kind of bow out?  To get out?  They were just showing a montage of his hissy fits on the field. 
[01:06:30]  Boy, he was good.  Just picking up the bases and throwing them.  Right.  Just kicking shit at the fucking umps.  Man, he was great.  He was a maniac.  See, I remember when he was here in New York and I was looking at his like stats or whatever.  Yeah.  He left New York 20 years ago.  Amazing.  Where he won a World Series with the Reds 20 years ago.  So he was the Yankees manager, what, late 80s?  I know he took over for Billy Martin one year.  Yeah.  Didn't even George hate each other by the end of it?  I don't know.  I think they hated each other. 
[01:07:00]  I felt like Lou Piniella was the Yankees manager for a while.  It was only three seasons.  Yeah.  And I think one of the seasons he took over for Billy Martin.  So didn't it feel like he was here for a while?  Yeah.  That's nothing, right?  Lou.  Mom is in her 90s.  Oh, okay.  What do you expect, Lou?  Well, come on.  Light up.  Well, that's why I'm asking.  What else is going on there?  Is he all right?  Is he just sick of baseball?  Yeah.  Maybe he wants to relax.  He wants to relax.  My mom needs me home. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  That's the headline.  Tend to his ailing 90-year-old mother, Margaret.  Who is that bitch?  Sexy name.  Margaret.  All right.  Well, here's Lou Piniella after yesterday's game, I guess.  I appreciate my four years here from the Cub organization.  The city's special.  People here are special. 
[01:08:00]  And I'm appreciative.  I cried a little bit after the game.  I get emotional.  I'm sorry.  I'm not trying to be.  This will be the last time I put on a uniform.  It's been...  It's been very special to me. 
[01:08:30]  Well, outside of that, I've enjoyed working with all of you.  You all have been very fair to me.  And I appreciate it.  I'm going to go home and do the things that I have to do there and enjoy my retirement.  I wish this organization nothing but the best in the past and the future by Ricketts family.  They're nice people.  And they're going to do everything in their power to bring a winner here.  I wish Jim well in his search for a new manager. 
[01:09:00]  I'm sure he'll get the right guy.  And I look forward to watching Cub Baseball on television.  He got a little choked up there for a while.  He was able to bring it back together toward the end.  What does he sound like?  Huh?  He sounds like meatloaf.  Meatloaf.  I'm trying to think.  We're in this dude list. 
[01:09:30]  I'm wearing his uniform.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Turn this thing around.  Jimmy Stewart.  A little Jimmy Stewart.  I don't know.  Why meatloaf?  When he was on our show or Fight Club?  I just hear it in his voice.  Yeah, he sounds a little Fight Club-y.  Fight Club-y?  I could just close my eyes and picture Meatloaf saying the things that he's saying.  Meatloaf.  Fight Club rules.  Who knew he was just playing himself, though?  What a weirdo.  Meatloaf is a weirdo.  I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.  We liked Meatloaf when he came on the show, though. 
[01:10:00]  My favorite part of Meatloaf and Fight Club is when he goes to shake Rupert's hand.  How he throws his donut away and then proceeds to lick every finger before offering his hand.  That's one of my favorite things.  What a strange guy.  Yeah, Meatloaf.  So that's the Lou Piniello audio that everyone's talking about, but I don't know.  It's all right.  Yeah, that's not bad.  It's no Mike Schmidt.  No.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  With two very bad knees. 
[01:10:30]  Did you?  Oh, boy.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  What happened?  What happened after that?  You don't want to be that guy.  Was that the end?  Mike Schmidt would kick your ass, though.  That's the funny part about that.  Dream came true.  You don't want to mess with Mike Schmidt.  No. 
[01:11:00]  He's a bit surly.  Surly?  Oh, yeah.  He's surly.  How do you fucking go up like that?  The dream came true.  What a fairy.  It's going to be no crying when this is over.  I'm not going to be in front of some stupid microphone.  A good long career.  Get the fuck out of here.  I remember starting in the mid-90s.  My dream to do radio.  I'm just so happy the dream came true. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, that's going to happen.  It's going to be more like Zippity-Doo-Dah.  I remember coming to this job with two bad knees from sucking my boss's dick for shit  pay for so many years.  I thought we weren't going there.  You just went there a little bit.  No, it was Apollo air conditioning.  Oh, okay.  That was when I was on my knees.  I'm just waiting for you to open that door and I'm going to fucking knock it right the 
[01:12:00]  fuck down.  I could give a shit.  I'm going to knock that fucking door down.  You were talking about that, not radio?  Yeah, I was talking about real work.  Oh, okay.  I'm not working for a living.  Really?  Working for a living.  You don't remember the first eight contracts we signed in radio?  What's wrong with you?  You got soft hands, Mr. Hooper, from counting money all your life.  City hands.  Top five Gulf oil spill songs.  Sign me a cheap shank.  What? 
[01:12:30]  That's right.  Are you kidding?  Are these like tribute songs?  You know, it's the song that everyone has to make when there's a thing happening.  That's great.  Good.  This is going to be really fucking embarrassing.  Well, let's start with...  See if we can guess also.  We got to always try to guess what they're going to rhyme.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  No real order here.  Foil.  I wonder what it'll rhyme with.  Yeah.  There's two that are...  Get it.  Two out of the five really stand out. 
[01:13:00]  So I'm going to start with one that might not stand out as much.  All right.  And then I'll give you one that really stands out.  And we'll kind of go back and forth.  Okay?  We start with Thelma Peterson.  She made the top five Gulf oil spill songs.  Thelma.  A song called I Am At War.  Oh, God.  I am your shoreline.  Hippie fuck.  I am your shoreline.  Yeah, we didn't rhyme. 
[01:13:30]  I am a lifeline.  Lifeline.  I am a clothesline.  I am a punchline.  I am a cocaine line.  I am a long line.  She sucks.  I am in the sand that I've been drawing.  I'm a line.  Ugh.  Oh, okay.  Two more coming in for Lou Piniella.  Thank you. 
[01:14:00]  I'm trying to give this guy credit.  Tom and Philly, I guess.  Piniella sounds like it's still real to me, damn it.  Oh, yeah.  I love that.  The wrestling fan.  And Dana Carvey doing a little George Bush from Dana Houston.  Yeah.  A little something going on in there.  All right.  Let's get back to the song.  I am the keeper of the mainland.  I am the...  She's a busy bitch.  She's a shoreline.  She's a lifeline.  She's a keeper.  Well, arrogant. 
[01:14:30]  Something about a land, a hand.  Oh, it's going to be hand.  I'm sorry.  What was the question?  She's the keeper of the mainland.  The mainland?  It's got to be hand.  Oh, I like to do splits and get my pussy filled.  It's called the sand.  You know, it could be sand, though.  All right.  You go land.  I'm going to go stand.  You're going to go hand.  No, it was land already.  She said the mainland.  I say sand.  I said hand.  Oh, hand.  I think Jimmy's right with sand, though.  I'm going to go stand.  We've got to make a stand. 
[01:15:00]  Okay.  Yeah, maybe.  All right.  Of the mainland, I am the marshes and estuaries.  What?  What?  That doesn't rhyme with anything.  That is she stinks.  If you're going to do a rhyming song, then do some fucking rhyming.  Estuary.  I am the grains of sand.  Sand. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Shifting sand.  Very good.  Shifting sand.  This is awful.  Tremendously good.  This is coffee shop music.  Yeah.  Anything worse than coffee shop music?  Oh, it's the worst.  I am.  Oh, shit.  Can I toodley-doo to her?  Oh, God, yes.  I wonder if I could toodley-doo.  A bunch of Harry Bushes just singing who gives a shit songs as you're trying to get your fucking coffee in the morning. 
[01:16:00]  And I am a workboat, and I am your heritage.  And I've made a living for many a man.  For generations.  Harvesting these waters.  But now my engines quietly stand. 
[01:16:30]  What?  What?  What?  What?  Are we done with this one?  Something about the engines, the fucking fishing.  She stinks.  You want to give it just a little longer?  She would stink in the 60s.  A little Joan Baez.  Yeah.  Going on here.  And I am waiting.  Waiting.  All right.  That is a song to end.  Waiting.  Waiting.  That's a rhyme. 
[01:17:00]  I am waiting.  The oil I use for masturbating.  Or I attract sharks when I'm menstruating.  At this tragedy of man.  All right.  Here comes the rhyme line.  From the ocean's floor.  Drifts closer to my shore.  That's what she's doing.  This song really is a bore. 
[01:17:30]  It's making people want to snore.  I'm a hairy pitted whore.  Did she say, I am a whore?  Yeah.  I am a whore.  This is my whore.  This is my whore.  This is my whore.  This is my whore.  It's a whore.  See, it's the fucking...  It's the shoreline.  Is it whore with the oil men?  I am a whore.  Shut up. 
[01:18:00]  It's gone.  Oil's gone.  Shut up.  This is my whore.  How about fucking...  Instead of coming up with a dumb song, you get down there with a brush and start scrubbing  some pelicans.  Get involved.  There you go.  You're at war.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Get down there.  Get in it.  Use all the people we can get.  You're breathing that shit.  Kind of goddamn joke.  Are we done with this one?  Yes.  It's so annoying.  I want to continue. 
[01:18:30]  I know.  It really is one of those things where it's like...  It's really annoying.  I am a seabird.  Oh, she's a seabird.  And I wade the water.  Then what?  My body's covered.  In.  I'm a seabird up in a will.  What?  What did she say?  She's a seabird.  And what happened to the seabird?  And my body's covered in oil. 
[01:19:00]  Is that what she said?  Yes.  Listen to it.  It's horrible.  She goes, covered.  I didn't even know.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  I'm a seabird.  Uh-huh.  And I wade the waters.  My body's covered up in oil.  What?  I want to fly home.  Oh.  She wants to fly home.  My wings are heavy. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Got oil on them.  And these days of struggling have taken their toll.  Toll.  And I am imprisoned.  She's imprisoned?  By this tragedy of man.  Man!  Out from the ocean's floor. 
[01:20:00]  Shut up.  Strangling our coastal shores.  Power of money roars.  And I am at war.  She's at war, right.  You're not at war.  She's at war if she ever tried to take a razor.  That big, hairy, hippie bush.  Holy shit.  That big, giant, hairy, hippie bush.  That's worse than oil on the water.  Big corporation wins that war every time.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Unfortunately.  I am at war. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  I bet she's in the studio like, you know, yeah.  Really digging it.  The guy at the board, he's got a big tied back ponytail.  He's shaking his head like, yeah, you're nailing this one, man.  You think she's in a wife beater?  This is going to make a statement.  She's in a wife beater.  Doesn't believe in deodorant.  No, of course not.  Hairy fucking armpits.  Big, hairy armpits.  Just stinking up the studio.  An Igbo band's using the studio next.  She's at war, and she's using mustard gas from her crotch. 
[01:21:00]  Not for her.  Well, this next one definitely stands out.  You think that one stands out?  Yeah.  She's not good.  This is Pershing Wells.  Oh, yeah?  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again.  All right.  Oh, a house next door to me was sold.  What? 
[01:21:30]  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Who saw that coming?  They tricked me on that one, yo.  Wow, I didn't see that coming.  Hide your daughters.  Here we go.  Damn, I didn't see that coming.  I thought it was going to be like a country type shit.  A little hoedown.  All right.  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again.  Might be drowning, but we ain't dead.  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again.  Heck of a job. 
[01:22:00]  Heck of a job.  Yeah.  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again.  There's one damn thing after another.  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again.  How much abuse can a Cajun take?  It was 0420 2010.  Didn't know the place would never be the same again.  Always stressing about hurricanes.  But this thing surely would change again.  Big old...  The beat is actually really good, but the lyrics are terrible.  It's fucking DJ Jazzy Jeff. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And the Fresh Prince type fucking rapping.  It changes the game.  This sounds like parents just don't understand.  That's them?  Get the fuck out of here, white boys.  No, they're white guys.  Oh, no wonder it's so bad.  White boys.  Wonder the rap is bad.  Yeah, big oil drilling, a mile below.  Hit the big one.  Lo and behold.  Pressure high, technology low.  Didn't take long for the things to blow.  In pristine waters, up in flames. 
[01:23:00]  Eleven family lives wouldn't be the same.  Everyone did the best they say.  Jumped into the water to live another day.  Hours to days, days to weeks.  Looks like they're never gonna stop the leak.  Poison gushing up into our land.  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again.  Fuck Louisiana.  And fuck these two.  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again. 
[01:23:30]  Might be drowning, but we ain't dead.  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again.  Your wife.  Heck of a job.  Heck of a job.  Looks like Louisiana's drowning again.  Yeah, we get it.  I'm done with this one.  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's move on.  Enough of these white wannabe wigs.  This next one is John Bagnato.  Oh, yeah?  Sweet crude blues.  Sweet crude blues. 
[01:24:00]  What's out there on the horizon, man?  Oh, shit.  A little Muddy Waters action.  Is that what we got?  Sounds a little Muddy Waters itch.  Boily waters.  No, it don't look good.  No, it don't look good.  It's that crude so sweet.  Mom, I can't resist.  Billy Crystal.  Well, you'll be so sweet.  Baby, I can't resist. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, I like it.  Can Zeppelin rip this off and make it better?  Yes, it probably can.  I fucking like it, though, man.  Makes me want to go listen to real blues now.  Does it?  You don't like the blues at all, right?  No, I hate the blues.  Why?  It's always the same.  Everything sounds exactly the fucking same.  I want to fill my tank up.  Yeah.  And the movie's got to have it, baby.  The what?  I don't know, but I'm ringing my bell.  What the fuck? 
[01:25:00]  What?  I don't know.  What did he say there?  I went backwards.  He wants to fill his tank up in this song.  Yeah, I want to fill my tank up.  And the movie's got to have it, baby.  Made the whole world mess.  But you just keep it flowing, mama.  And I won't give her care.  And I don't care about nothing.  Just keep it flowing, mama. 
[01:25:30]  This is terrible.  What's he doing with that guitar?  He's abusing it.  I don't give her care.  My face buried so deep in black.  I won't come up for air.  Ain't no relief wells around here.  What's this going on?  Here's something.  When you write a song, have a point.  And how about the music going to everything?  Huh?  How about the music actually going with the rest of the song? 
[01:26:00]  You don't like the harmonica?  Dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  It's a horrible guitar.  So what you got?  Just do a little blues riff.  My drills got diamonds.  My rig, it shines like gold.  My rigger.  His rig, it shines like gold.  Ooh, I'm sophisticated.  Well, my drills got diamonds. 
[01:26:30]  My rig, it shines like gold.  My rig, it shines like gold.  I'm high tech now.  The way you're flowing, baby.  I'm about to lose control.  This is so fucking annoyingly bad.  Gave her my best junk shot.  Even my top cue.  Couldn't tame that wild girl.  Don't think nothing will.  Gave her my junk shot.  Even my top cue. 
[01:27:00]  And I couldn't tame that wild girl.  I don't think...  Another white guy.  Another white guy.  Another white guy.  I'm already done with that one.  Goes on for a while.  Of course it does.  We'll save you on that one.  You didn't like that one?  That guy stinks.  I like the fucking blues riff, though.  That was terrible.  Well, if it had real fucking soul and lyrics, it would be kind of cool.  More tragic than the oil spill.  These songs. 
[01:27:30]  Next one is Mac...  Doing more damage.  Mac Harrell.  A song just called Oil and...  Anyone?  Water.  Wait, this guy is calling you out, Ant.  Because you don't understand the blues.  It was Kevin in Atlanta.  Kevin.  Right.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  Explain the blues to Anthony.  School me, please.  All right, Anthony.  You don't understand the delicate double entendre the blues presents.  When the guy says his face is buried in black, that's a suggestive thing. 
[01:28:00]  The same thing about his rig is about to blow.  Just like the old Zeppelin songs.  You squeeze my lemon, let the juice drip down my leg.  All those in the blues are double entendres that are supposed to be funny.  That guy sucks.  So I'm supposed to...  What was he singing about?  What was the double entendre then?  His face is buried in black.  So what is he...  Well, if you're a gentleman of color, you can figure that out.  So what?  He's...  But he was white.  Doing some pussy diving?  What is he doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, and his rig is going to blow. 
[01:28:30]  So that's his...  His sperm is...  His dick is going to blow.  He's about to make cumzies?  That's exactly right.  The double entendre and the funniness cannot possibly outdo the shittiness of the music.  I agree.  He wasn't going for funny.  He was going for double entendre.  Oh, well.  But he sucks at it.  Swing and a miss.  If you listen to the blues a little more, Anthony, I think you would appreciate it.  I hate the blues.  I've heard them over and over again.  It's the same song. 
[01:29:00]  Well, what about Robert Randolph?  Who the fuck is Robert Randolph?  Give us a little Robert Randolph.  Which one do you like?  Whatcha At?  That's a good one.  All right.  Stop right there.  Whatcha At?  You got that?  E-Rock.  Robert Randolph.  No, it's not in there.  Whatcha...  Of course it is.  And who wants to hear that shit?  Give us another one.  No, I wouldn't like it.  Turn Anthony on to a blues song.  Which one would you suggest right now?  All right.  Let's see.  Anyone by Zeppelin's fine. 
[01:29:30]  No, we're not doing the Zeppelin thing.  No, that's fucking...  Real hometown blues.  Real hometown blues.  I don't even like those stupid Zeppelin bluesy shit.  We want the guy to be as dark as night.  Give us one.  All right.  Let's see.  Anything by B.B. King is good.  You're a lame ass.  God, B.B. King.  I like B.B. King though.  You can't ask, but that's...  Overrated shithead.  No, he was good.  B.B. King stinks.  He was like more...  He was more mainstream blues, though. 
[01:30:00]  I thought we were getting down and dirty with the fucking blues.  Ba-da-da-da-dump.  Oh, wow.  Is that hot?  Ba-da-da-da-dump.  B.B. King was...  It was hard for the first guy to come up with that.  First guy that came up with that was impressive.  Impressive.  You don't want B.B. King?  And?  No, he stinks.  He's fucking...  All of these blues guys are the most overrated piles of shit.  You don't like his guitar, Lucille?  No.  Oh, stupid Lucille.  You didn't like Lucille?  Another pretty name.  Yuck.  How about When Love Comes to Town?  That song he did with U2. 
[01:30:30]  Love does show up once in a while.  Ba-da-da-da.  Give me a little When Love Comes to Town.  B.B. King and fucking U2.  Oh.  Yeah, he was actually fucking U2.  Look at him with his guitar.  Tell me if you like this.  Overrated, bloated douche.  From Rattlin' Home.  Mm-hmm.  When Love Comes to Town.  Listen to fucking B.B. and Lucille.  Yeah, it's...  The thing is, this is U2.  Not yet.  He starts it off.  Vano starts it off. 
[01:31:00]  Come on, B.B.  Where are you?  Oh, right here.  Love comes to town.  I'm gonna jump that train.  When Love comes to town.  I'm gonna catch that flame.  May not go to heaven.  Let you down.  But I did what I did before Love comes to town.  Here comes Lucille now, Ann.  For you.  Ah, yeah. 
[01:31:30]  There we go.  A little Lucille for you.  Next overrated plucking of the strings.  Things.  Wow.  Big lead.  You can fade it out.  We don't have to play all of them.  And that's U2.  It's a full band.  It's like the...  But just that...  Blah-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  Blah-dee-blah-dee-blah.  Blah-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  Oh, suffering, suffering.  Blah-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  Oh, hardship, hardship.  Blah-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  Oh, terribleness.  Who cares?  People are suggesting blues songs. 
[01:32:00]  This isn't gonna go well.  It's not gonna listen to you.  No one is going to turn me on to a blues song that I like.  Someone wants to turn you on to some Howlin' Wolf.  Howlin' Wolf.  No.  No.  What about Where Did I Sleep Last Night?  What?  Fucking Nirvana.  Well, he actually made that song really fucking good.  He certainly did.  I do like Led Belly's version better.  You do?  You got Led Belly, Where Did I Sleep Last Night?  Where did you sleep last night?  What?  Where did you sleep last night?  Sorry.  Iraq, you got that. 
[01:32:30]  Nirvana's version is great, but I actually love Led Belly.  Better?  Yeah, I do.  Kurt's version is ridiculous from The Unplugged.  Led Belly.  One of the last songs he did.  Oh, great.  That's wonderful.  Heady Ledbetter.  Looks like fucking Stimey.  Black girl, black girl, don't lie to me.  Tell me where did you sleep last night?  From 1944.  In the pines, in the pines, no way the sun never shines. 
[01:33:00]  I wish you had a cold night, too.  Black girl, black girl, where will you go?  I'm gone where the cold wind blows.  To the colored's only bathroom, to the colored's only bathroom.  1944.  Have fun there, Led Belly.  Kurt put some pain behind that song, his version.  Yeah, see, he's just kind of... 
[01:33:30]  He was screaming by the end of that song.  Because he knew Courtney was fucking everything that moved.  Was she really?  I don't know.  That's how I interpreted his fucking angst.  Here's Oil and Water, Anthony.  Yeah.  By Mack Harrell, doing the Top 5 Gulf Oil Spill song.  What's up, Patrice?  New Orleans is real quiet.  Quiet.  The seabirds all are gone.  Are they? 
[01:34:00]  Even folks on Bourbon Street don't party on...  I bet they do, by the way.  You want to take this instant feedback, God?  Ian from Colorado.  Ian.  Fuck New York City.  Uh-huh.  Yeah!  What do you guys do for the world?  Oh, yeah.  Sarcasm and negativity.  Oh.  Yeah, fuck New York City.  You know, the pinnacle of the free world.  Shut up.  Where's he from?  That means this guy likes these dopey songs.  Where's he from? 
[01:34:30]  Like I said, Colorado.  Oh, Colorado.  I like Colorado.  What a fucking...  I don't mind Colorado.  What an asshole.  You have to goof on these songs.  They're getting nothing done.  Shut up, Mr. Landlocked.  Just sit there.  These are struggling artists.  No beach motherfucker.  These are struggling artists that see an opportunity here.  They don't...  Yeah.  I bet you if you interview them, they don't give a shit.  One fucking shit about what's going on down there.  Oh.  But they think to themselves, oh, this might be a way for people to discover my fucking talent. 
[01:35:00]  The blues suck.  It's the monotonous fucking redundant garbage.  Has been for years.  Mm-hmm.  We're gone.  Even folks on Bourbon Street don't party all night long.  Yes, they do.  Do you think the people on Bourbon Street...  They never stop partying.  Do you think the whores with the beads showing their pussy and their tits give a fuck about an oily pelican? 
[01:35:30]  How many days before...  They don't care.  They're showing their tits.  They're drunk.  Even after Katrina, which I think was the five-year anniversary this past weekend, by the way...  Yeah.  They opened that shit pretty fucking quick, considering.  There's an oil spill out in the Gulf, and you think Bourbon Street, they're not fucking drinking hurricanes?  Right.  Hurricanes, Alice!  They were drinking hurricanes, I would bet, a week after fucking Katrina.  I think they might have closed for a week before some of those places started opening up again. 
[01:36:00]  Give me some beads!  They're my tits!  Yeah, that's not happening because there's oil in the Gulf?  This guy's delusional.  All night long.  Idle shrimp boats drift and roars like lambs led to slaughter.  Really?  The falling tide just leaves the residue.  All days you do, I'll fuck your daughter.  Oil and water.  Oil and water. 
[01:36:30]  Oil and water don't mix, but vinegar, if you shake it, makes a good dressing.  Oil and water don't mix like the races.  We've got to split up black and white like oil and water.  It'd be great if this whole song was just about separating the races.  Water is clean, oil is filthy.  Nobody likes mulatto water.  Mulatto water. 
[01:37:00]  Nobody likes tainted clean water,  dirtied by filthy black oil.  That water will never come to my house again.  Water is a gift from the Lord,  spoiled by dirty black oil.  sullied by dirty black oil.  He sounds like our favorite, man.  Fucking help me out. 
[01:37:30]  Edmund Fitzgerald.  Oh, the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Oh, Gordon Lightfoot.  Sounds a little Gordon Lightfoot-ish.  On the beaches of Louisiana,  and a lot of oil got on pelicans.  A pelican.  Oh, you can just make that song about anything.  A camera cruise in Florida.  Neil Diamond, too, right?  Yeah, when Neil's floating down.  He's kneeling on an empty beach with black mud everywhere.  Oh, we know what he's talking about there. 
[01:38:00]  Whoa!  I thought there was going to be a little trouble with that line.  Now he's not even hiding his places.  He's making the beach even dirtier  by kneeling his black skin with black oil on pure white sand.  Dirty racist.  Dirty racist.  Just saw an opportunity to get his dirty racist about there.  You think it's about the environment and cleaning up the beaches,  and it's all about splitting the country down the middle  and dividing the races with a fence. 
[01:38:30]  With a fence.  But everywhere, there's guilt for every creature lost.  The blame game's getting hotter.  Tragedy and politics they mix.  Like oil or water.  Water, water could be at my diner counter,  but oil can't keep it out of here. 
[01:39:00]  When my girlfriend bathes in water, I'm happy.  When she bathes in oil,  I yell at her like Frank Vincent in Jungle Fever.  A little wordy, Jimmy.  A little wordy.  It works.  It works, though.  I like wordy Jimmy.  Wordy Jimmy to get his point across.  Oh, I want to get my friends on horseback with crosses  because there's oil on my daughter.  A curly hair on her pillow. 
[01:39:30]  Jimmy's really getting into it.  He's closing his eyes,  swaying his head back and forth.  The worst thing is oil and daughter.  Yeah, that would be it.  The white knight's defending the church  in the honor of white sands.  White sands.  A little water in it.  Yeah, what's next?  We'll go on the end with this one.  That's right.  500 years ago, I could have bought her. 
[01:40:00]  That's fucking racist.  We don't even know, but it kind of sounds like it.  God tried to wipe them out.  God tried to wipe them out.  He tried to cleanse all the oil with water.  Oh, shit. 
[01:40:30]  Imagine you've come up with a song like that.  Here's my fucking tribute song.  And it's such a badly, thinly veiled...  Oh, yeah, just...  Oh.  And just in case at the end, he's like...  Oil is a euphemism.  For a nigga.  Just in case nobody fucking knew.  You didn't get the subtle message.  He wants to make sure everyone gets his message, right? 
[01:41:00]  In case it went over, everybody's dumb in Louisiana.  Why won't oil work?  Dirty oil taking all my jobs.  He's just running out of...  Oil taking welfare and stripping us dry.  Oh, shit.  Fuck.  We survived Katrina  And we'll endure this, too  It's just one more disaster 
[01:41:30]  That we'll find our way through  The mighty Mississippi  Keeps flowing to the sea  It'll keep a rolling there  Long after you and me  Ah.  Impressing.  It's a living legacy  For wayward sons and daughters 
[01:42:00]  Ah, waters.  Healing all my self-inflicted wounds  Oil and water  Oil and water  All right.  Jesus.  You didn't like that yet?  No.  Another fucking bit of drivel  Who cares?  Because it's all horse shit  Gives a shit  It's not getting anything done  It's not even on the news anymore  It's capped  Oil went away somewhere 
[01:42:30]  Right  Fuck them  Fuck it  Went somewhere  I just know  When I order a jumbo shrimp cocktail  It's delicious  Cocktail sauce  Not a speck of oil in it  A little horseradish, maybe?  Oh, it's wonderful  Take any oil taste away  That may be there  Yeah, there's nothing  You're braver than me  The oil comes out  No seafood  Oh, come on  Seafood, eat food  I'd say  Get the fuck out of here  I don't care where they're saying it's from  The Sunoco salad  Right  Exactly 
[01:43:00]  It just went away  What are you, an asshole?  You just  What's wrong with you?  They can't even find it  It doesn't know that in the fucking kitchen  They're wringing out the jumbo shrimp  There's so much oil still in them  Do you know how big the Gulf of Mexico is?  Yep  And how many gallons  How big it is?  How many gallons of oil per gallons of water is in the Gulf of Mexico?  Per gallons  This shit's moving around like the blob  It's killing it  It's the world's largest lava lamp  The Sun hits it  It degrades  It fucking  Get the fuck out of here  It goes to the bottom 
[01:43:30]  It fucking sits there  Everything's fine  You're crazy  You're crazy  They made a big deal out of it  It was nothing  You know what I want you to do when you go home?  Yeah  Is just go and put a whole gallon of olive oil in your sauna  Yeah  And sit in it  And see if  He does it every time he gets in  Yeah  And just put it in there and see what happens  Here's what it would amount to  Me taking an eyedropper  And putting one drop of oil in my jacuzzi  Who told you this?  That's it  Think how much water is in the Gulf of fucking Mexico 
[01:44:00]  I can't refute it because I didn't do any fucking research  But it sounds wrong  You tell me how many gallons of water is in the Gulf of Mexico  They sort of said that's what it's like  Nothing  Believe it or not  Who said that?  Who's they?  The people that want you to believe it  BP  A bunch of English people  Fucking Mr. Bean told you  It's nothing  I wouldn't worry about it  No  Blimey  It's wonderful  Actually it's good for your skin  Don't you know  Yes  Anthony John from Harrisburg  Jay Moore also wrote a Gulf song  Did he?  This guy wrote a Gulf song 
[01:44:30]  But it's Gulf  The oil is rocketing out of the earth like Yoo-Hoo  Rocking like Yoo-Hoo  I invented it  Finally the last Gulf oil spill song  This was in USA Today by the way  So they took this very seriously  I'm sorry we can't do the same here on the O.P. and Anthony show  Alright here we go  The Gulf of Mexico holds approximately 650 quadrillion gallons  What's a quadrillion?  Of what? 
[01:45:00]  That is a bunch of drillions  How many zillions is that?  Four  Is that zillions?  That would be  Is that zillions?  There is no such thing as zillion as a made up word  Yeah  It is  So where do we go?  It would be billions  It's billions  And after billions is  It's billions  Is it billions?  Trillions  A billion billions?  Billion  What's a quadrillion?  Million  Billion  Quadrillion  There's also quintillion  And what do you mean there's no zillion?  Glillion  There's no such thing as zillion 
[01:45:30]  Really watch this  Quadrillion is between  The Gulf has a zillion gallons of water  Alright  Quadrillion is between actually million and shitload  Thank you  Meaning a zillion  A shitload  And how many gallons?  That's the definition of zillion  No that  Quadrillion  You can't even wrap your fucking mind around that  Let me tell you  According to an estimated  Twenty  Or two hundred  And ten thousand gallons a day  This is based on if the shit 
[01:46:00]  The information is right  Estimated gallons leaked  That shit just kept coming out  Yeah  Yeah  Fast  Real fast  Yeah but  But it's such a huge fucking gulf  Alright well let's get to the last song  Don't worry about it  Here's the last song  Everyone relax  Have shrimp  Have clams  You have clams  Are you crazy?  It's wonderful  Get the fuck out of here  You and your petroleum claws at Red Lobster  Just petroleum claws  Enjoy your seafood stew 
[01:46:30]  I love it  Get the fuck out of here  Everyone relax a little bit  Really?  That's when we get all our fucking fishes up in that bullshit  Wonderful  It's still great  It's pristine  You get your jumbo shrimp with a side order  Of plutonium  You fucking weirdo  That's fucking great  Stop eating the shrimp  Now wait a minute  Is unfiltered oil dangerous though?  Is it more dangerous than the oil we get  That we put in our cars or whatever?  I don't think so  It's more natural  I guess  How many gallons is that?  I don't know  Yeah yeah  Two hundred and six million gallons of oil spilled 
[01:47:00]  Well that's a lot  No matter how you slice it  That's a lot of fucking oil  Not in six hundred and fifty quadrillion gallons of water  But it's  But you know what?  There's a logic missing here  I just realized what the logic is  Patrice O'Neill by the way  Obviously  Yeah  We didn't introduce you yet  The logic is  It's not  It's  It's just constantly there  It's floating around  It's fucking up life  I don't think the sun breaks it down  Two hundred and six million gallons of oil 
[01:47:30]  Within this  It's like I'm saying  It's like if you put a salad dressing in your bathtub  And that little piece is not on you there  But it's just in your bathtub  It's moving around  It's slushing around  And just fucking with you  It's there  It's there  You stay away from it  There's plenty other places  Your logic is like it fills up the gulf  And the gulf is on  It's  The logic is that it's  It's slushing around  And fucking shit up 
[01:48:00]  It's sunk already  It's fucking the sun  The sun broke it down  You're just making this shit up  The sun doesn't do that  Patrice  The sun breaks it down  Ant's a fuck the world type person  You're not going to convince him of anything  You're not going to  I'm a you can't fuck the world kind of guy  Is what I am  Oh yeah in the end you're right  I am  We  Ultimately  The world will be so mighty  The world will be fine after we're long gone  I wouldn't worry about it  And you know what  How many fish are swimming through that stupid fucking cloud of oil  Not many  You know what's funny about it 
[01:48:30]  Not many  Here's something  And after we're long gone  The earth will take its  The earth will take its million years and heal itself  And just grind us out of existence  And it'll just take  Everything we built  Everything we knew  Will just be gone  And eroded away like the mountains  And it'll just sit there for a million years  Because it can  And it'll be just fine  The earth got rid of  It'll just be fine  Entire mountain chains  Right  Have been just decimated to flat desert  And oceans  Were dried up and made into mountain chains  You think anything we make 
[01:49:00]  Is going to have an impact on this fucking planet  You think in the end  But the thing is we're living  That's the problem  You think in the end  Gives a shit about people  But you think in the end  What we're doing to the earth  Is just a scratch  It's nothing  And then the earth's like  That was cute  The earth can wait  Now just sit here and heal  Like a dog with a flea  It's just waiting for the shake  Because I don't know what time is  The earth doesn't know what time is  You just sit for the big shake  That the dog does  When it has an itch  Who cares  Unless we blow up the earth  Which I don't think is possible  You can't blow up the earth  Where it's going to crack  That's what I mean 
[01:49:30]  Unless we crack it in half  That's what I mean  That's about it  But you've seen history  Of how earth was made  Yeah  There was phenomenon  That caused us to even have air  It was like things that happened  Amazing  That fucking  That mean shit  That thing is God  Patrice  It was a  I believe that  It was a ball of fire  At one point  Now it's what we live  And we're just in the middle  Of its transformation  It's going to be something else  Yeah  It's just constantly evolving  And turning into something  Absolutely  Who created God 
[01:50:00]  That's the thing  I have a problem with  People that don't believe in God  That's when I shiver at night  And get real scared  Yeah  But that's the faith part  That's what is God  Yeah  But how did that come about?  It's thinking  What?  It doesn't matter  How did that come about?  That's like the space is infinite  And then  Oh that's creepy  It just keeps going on and on  There's no end  And then as a kid  You're like no  Then it ends  But then you go  What's behind the wall?  The problem with space  Is that it's not  It's not what we think it is  It's not just  It's not just something  It's just emptiness 
[01:50:30]  It keeps going  The reason  The one thing I learned  From  Is that the sun  What the orbit is  Is the sun is  Pressing down within  Dark matter  It's  It's something  That it exists  It's like  It's like this table  But it's  But how does space end?  It doesn't end  I think it folds up  That's where the black holes are  And wormholes  After the folds  What's out there?  They'll find a way to travel  Through all that shit  But what's  What's after the folds?  Another place in the same  Yeah  A nigga juggling  It's just a  Motherfucker 
[01:51:00]  Motherfucker playing basketball  And shit  That's why  God's farting  That's what Earthquakes  It's just  Our life means nothing  You know  But that's why I'm not scared  Of the asteroid  Because it's like  You know  The big asteroid's coming  Yeah  It's coming in like 110 years  And I'm like  Look I'm not a vampire  Yeah  Whatever  Yeah they'll figure out  How to fucking  Pull up an android  Fuck my grandkids  Hit it  Yeah  Good luck to you  Your fucking  Old rotted body  Will be shooting into  The fucking cosmos  When the asteroid hits 
[01:51:30]  Good luck to you  Who cares  The sun is just  Going to envelop the Earth  That's all that's going to happen  In a few billion years  The sun's going to burn out  I know the gases  Are going to expand it  And it's going to  Probably gobble up  The first three or four planets  Or whatever  And that's it  Then what happens?  We're done  And then the sun be bigger  So then  Then it shrinks  A few of the planets  Down the line  Might actually  Turn into  That's why I want to live forever  I just want to see  All this shit happen  Earth  Yeah  Oh no  I'd love to see  I'd love to see the next planet  Yeah  Maybe Jupiter  Will have some fucking  You know what I mean? 
[01:52:00]  Maybe the sun gets a little bigger  And then Mars fucking decides  To you know  Get some life on it  You think there'll be a generation  That actually  Hops to another planet?  That whole fucking  Battlestar Galactica shit?  But I mean like  You're born  And by  Sometime in your life  You're actually  Hopping to another planet  How cool would that be?  I don't think that's  Going to happen here  Well not anytime soon  But I'm just saying  At the speed of light  Which is very difficult  I'm just saying  Can you imagine?  But I mean  Hopping to live  That's it  You can make it to Mars 
[01:52:30]  Oh like the fucking  Last ship out  I would  You know  What is it like  What's that stupid  What's the Will Smith movie?  The big one?  Independence Day  Yeah  Like them  Like those people  Yeah  They just traveled around  Raping  Fucking people up  Destroying plants  And they weren't here  For friendship  Maybe we should do that  Because that's how we are  We wouldn't go someplace  And go hi  We're here for peace  We'll just like  We'll go  There's some peaceful  Fucking aliens  With three fingers  And suction cups  Just suction cups 
[01:53:00]  Fucking saying hello to us  And we'll just  Fucking kill them  Just start hacking them apart  Just think American Indians  And bullets up  A big time  Fucking  Big time  You know  Technology for them  Like we don't need  They're not a ray gun  We just go down there  And just start  Shooting those triangle heads  And those big eyes  When it goes down  They're going to laugh at us  And what we think  We have to protect ourselves  I hate the fact  That we're stupid  We're the low  Every alien is better than us  Yeah  We're always the dumb ones  Yeah what if we're just 
[01:53:30]  What if they're really good  At building ships  That can go places  But nothing else  And hiding behind clouds  And those niggas love  Building pyramids  But I'm going to tell you  Something  A glock to the fucking  Giant  Big eye temple  Boom  Really fucking  So dead  Really  Wah wah wah wah  Wah wah  Really  Bow  Right in his stomach  Yeah  They cut off the ship  That's where his dumb heart is  Is in his fucking belly button  Just start unloading on him  They don't have a force field

[02:00:00]  Yeah, I'm just  We gotta bring that to the show  What, X-ray machines?  Yeah, man  Your thoughts on the airport  And how you had to deal with an X-ray  That's what you were talking about  The X-ray machine in L.A.  It was in L.A.  That's my first X-ray machine sighting  Yeah  You know, it was the first one  It was really creepy looking  It's one of those total recall things  Where you see right through the clothes  And you could see people's  And you just see the willingness  The willingness  Of everybody to just comply 
[02:00:30]  To go through  Like, the willingness of the workers  We were talking about this last week  It's unbelievable  You want people to rally with you  No one wants to rally  The willingness of the workers  To just fuck you  And also the lack  The lack of  You know, if you ever watched  The Mahujadine workout  Like, you see that those  Are top-of-the-line murderers  Right, right  But our top-of-the-line murderers  Are trying to fight  Like, they're over 
[02:01:00]  They're fighting  But they have top-of-the-line murderers  Here trying to kill us  So there's no bottom-wrong murderers  We have bottom-wrong people  Protecting  At the airport  I mean, really out of shape  Little Mexican guys at LAX  Weird-looking Ethiopians  In Minneapolis  Fat black bitches in Newark  Yeah, I love that  And those are our lines of defense  That's our first line of defense  I had an argument  One of them bitches  I mean, not a business argument 
[02:01:30]  But like I said  When she was going through my bag  We have to check in  For bomb material or whatever  And I'm just like  Look at, you know  You know what  Unpack my bags, right  And she's like  No, I said  Be careful  Be careful with that  Sugar draws  She goes  Why?  It's nothing but a bootleg  Videotape  Like, she's arguing me  Like a bitch  She's fucking debating you  On your goods  That I met in the street  Or something  You know, she's just like  So she's checking my shit  So this is a bitch  That's, you know  But  Our head of the thing 
[02:02:00]  So I've never been  I've never seen the x-ray machines  Until LA  Can I stop for a second?  I love the fact that you  Despise authority  Maybe not despise  But you really get  Frustrated by authority  In general  No, I tell you  I figured it out  I don't get frustrated  By authority anymore  We've flown with you, man  You get just annoyed  And I don't blame you  I don't  Because you know  It's all just phony shit  It's people  That I  The idea of most things  There's only a few ideas  In the world  That in itself is awful  I can't think of many 
[02:02:30]  But like the idea of the police  Is fantastic  The idea that somebody's there  To help you  If you're in trouble  Or blah, blah, blah  But the  But the actual people  That there's a person  That you go  Hell, hey  I need help  And they go  Calm down, sir  What's going  Someone's stabbing me  In my neck  Sir  Can you tell me  Where you  Calm down  There's a fucking  Stabbing  In my neck  I'm trying  Someone's killing me  Omar Thornton 
[02:03:00]  Omar Thornton  Calm down, Mr. Thornton  I'm calm  I'm done killing everybody  Calm down, nigga  It's like  I'm done killing you  I don't think I'm going  To be killing anyone else  It's just  It's not  It's just the people, dude  That's all  So you're watching  Look at the x-ray machine  If I thought it was  What it was for  And that's all it was for  That's fine  You know, whatever, dude  I mean, the total recall shit  Was fun to look at  Yeah 
[02:03:30]  But the compliance  Because you can't just go through  Like, total recall  And there's a guy  Looking at  Just keep walking  You have to stand there  And just  And you raise your hand  Put your arms up  It's all  It's just  Submission  On your knees  And I tell people  Like, when I go through  Sir, can you take  I said, I'd rather have the check  And I say  Because I dressed at the house  I don't want to get undressed here  I don't  I might have a foot problem  I have, you know  Wait, wait, wait  What's the problem 
[02:04:00]  That you don't like doing?  Taking your shoes off?  I don't like to get undressed  Like, you don't like taking  A hoodie off  Or whatever  Whatever you're wearing  Or a jacket  But I do it  I just keep anything on  That I can  You can keep your hat  You can keep your jewelry  It's  They tell you to take off  The only thing that's  That you have to take off  Shoes  And sweaters  Button up sweaters  You keep button on shirts  You know, I'm trying to  You can keep your hat on  You don't have to take your hat off  You have to put your computer in 
[02:04:30]  You know, I understand  You know, moving faster  But I just  You like to feel  A little bit of  Freedom  A little bit  Are you  So you basically just because  You're like  They're not going to tell me  To take all the  It's more of a principle thing  It's just a principle thing  You know, it's just  Because it's not  If I thought it was really  About safety  I would  And you're watching  This fucking  These people  Hold their hands up  You have to  There's  There's  Assume the position  And it only makes  Horrible people  More horrible  And more lazy 
[02:05:00]  That we  We don't have  And I mean  I travel a lot  People  There's probably  Some TSA people  That listen to the show  You're not the most  You're not our top  Physical  I've heard conversations  About  I need  I get off in an hour  You know  The Mahujadine  Is trying to murder you  With shampoo  We can't have people  Who are trying to catch Maury  Because they've been on since 12  Ah yes  We can't have that  You know what I'm saying  So  Those are who 
[02:05:30]  You're giving  Lesser people  Than you  On a regular basis  Power  Over your life  And they don't even know  The fucking rules  So I just go look  Can you say no  To the x-ray machine  I'm just letting people know  If you don't want to take  The x-ray machine  You don't have to  Right  But when you go through  The plan is  To fucking hassle you  As much as they can  So that you next time  Go through this fucking machine  You go through the machine  Because I went through  And I beat  So it was my belt 
[02:06:00]  So I said  Just check me man  So he goes  Mail assist  No one's coming  Five minutes  Mail assist  Meanwhile  My computer's being  You know  The fucking  Fred Flintstone  Conveyor belt music  Falling on my shit  By the time I get  To my fucking computer  There's seven boxes  On top  I'm like sir  My computer's over there  My wallet  I put my wallet  In my phone  In my shoes  Oh shit  And I'm like  My shit's right there  Calm down sir  That's who  Calm down sir 
[02:06:30]  Calm down  So I'm like  Looking like crazy nigga  Give me  Look  Can you put yourself  In my position  Mexican kid  Who  Tase him  Yeah  Tase him  That's what I'm saying  Don't tase me bro  My heart can't keep up  With that shit  The question is though  You're not willing  To put yourself  In his position  Like even though  He is just a Mexican kid  Their idea is  Look we gotta do this  To search people  Going through  And this guy  Who is probably  Almost definitely  Not a terrorist  Is giving us  A hard time  Why  That's probably  Their position 
[02:07:00]  Like this guy  Is not  They know  Patrice  Not a terrorist  That's why though  They know he's not  And why are they  Giving him a hard time  I don't think they should  But I don't  The x-ray machine  I don't care about  Everyone should go through it  Everyone  It's so weird dude  Just that we just go  Okay  We're scared to death  I mean  You know  I'm just saying  It's not  Because I'm trying  To be a crusader  Because when it comes  Down to it  I don't want to get  Butted in the head  With a gun  But I'm saying  It's like  They give these people  Orders 
[02:07:30]  And they follow them  It's like the  Abu Ghraa bitch  The first time I looked  I said  Do you think that bitch  Did that on her own  She was instructed  To do what she's doing  And they just go  Okay  That's when  That's when  Everybody goes  Okay  And they don't see it  Like this is some  Big conspiracy thing  It's not even that  It's like you just say  Yes  You just walk  And die  You'll die  These fucking  X-ray machines  Do your  X-ray machines  Cause cancer 
[02:08:00]  You only get  X-rayed  When you're hurt  They need to see  I know  They need to see  Your bone  Other than that  What the fuck  Are you doing  Walking through  An x-ray machine  If you fly a lot  It can't be good  If you're a frequent  Flyer  Can you imagine  I don't think  They're x-rays though  I don't think  They're actual x-rays  It's some new technology  I think it's some new shit  That uses something else  So that means  We don't know  What the new shit causes  Right exactly  Who knows  Could they see 
[02:08:30]  Something shoved up your ass  Cause that's what's next  Is plastiques  Shoved up the ass  With a vagina  Blowing planes up mid air  So that's why  I want them to be able  To see in there  Vagina bombs  Once it's vagina bombs  And you can't even  Go with Arab anymore  Cause a fucking  A Chechnya  Looks white  So you get some  Some fucking  Extremist  I want everybody  To have their  Fucking assholes  Photographed  I don't want to  Fucking plummet  30,000 feet  I don't either  And that's  But  How much  Explosives can you get  Can you put in your  Asshole  You don't need much 
[02:09:00]  Probably by the little  Thin skin of a plane  If you're in the bathroom  Behind the cockpit  Just put your  Put your butthole right  Why are you putting  Your asshole  Against the door  Trying to let him  Match  But that's the thing  I think  I think the fear  Is  You know  Look  If you have  An American ID  Man  There's not  We don't train  Fucking  Suicide people  We train  Homicide people  Right  We kill you  And try to live  Or we kill you  And then 
[02:09:30]  Off ourselves  But  Foreigners should  Get checked for that  I know that's still  Fucking with rights  But  Who the fuck  Yeah  You know  Check me for weed  Check Norton  For meth  You know what I'm saying  Check a Chinese guy  For heroin  Yeah yeah  You feel me  But check the Arabs  For fucking bombs  Me and Ed  Feel left out  You got the  You guys  I'm not meth  You're meth  If Jimmy's meth  I'm meth  And what's it  You're cocaine  He's cocaine 
[02:10:00]  I'll take cocaine  I'll give you cocaine  Looks like a Wall Street guy  Although I never liked the cocaine  I wasn't a fan of the cocaine  Crack  You want crack  Crack  Meth  Crystal meth  Crack  Whatever  The cheap shit  That I can really  Some cracky crack  I can mule a bunch of it  Up my asshole  I mean it's just  It's like look  You just see that  I was hoping for the hash  By the way  I enjoyed the hash  You know what  I liked the little hash 
[02:10:30]  Like fucking  Midnight Express  You're not coke  Nah I hated coke  Actually  You'd be the hash  He's taped to your body  I like the hash  Hash taped to your body guy  Yeah that's you  Oh that's so 75  Idealistic  Idealistic  All American  Just gonna make a few bucks  On one run from Turkey  And he gets caught  You fucking look like  You should be fucking  Selling liquor in Mexico  There's no way  You're not a clean cut guy  Who tapes  Not me  Oh Opie  Yeah yeah yeah  No I'm like  Opie's the one that thinks 
[02:11:00]  It's just one  I'm just gonna do it once  I'll make a shit load of money  I'm way too uptight  To be into coke  Don't  You didn't figure that one out  I need something  To chill me the fuck out  You could just sell it though  They look at you though  They see blonde hair  Good looking guy  Could be a broker  I just wanna mellow out  I think I'm gonna start  Smoking pot on vacation  Oh yeah  Yeah I think this is the big turn  Alright  I very rarely would encourage that  I'm going back  Very rarely would encourage that  Normally as a recovering addict  I would not encourage marijuana use  However  Yeah  It's starting to make more and more sense 
[02:11:30]  To smoke a little weed  To chill the fuck out  And I just hate  I like to be safe  I'm with you guys  I do  But it's just  I'm kind of weird Patrice  I get really annoyed  I understand  You know what we're trying to prevent  But it's still just  The noise the fuck out of you  Because the bottom level people  Aren't  And they love the power they have  Yes  It's no top level plan  To the bottom level people  It's just  Do what you're fucking told  Do what you're told  Do your job  And I don't even have confidence 
[02:12:00]  In those people  That they're actually able  To stop this shit  Do you see the people  That work at the airport  Do you see the TSA  I don't feel safer  No they're not  I don't feel safer  It's precious  It's a precious movie  Precious  Throughout the entire  Everybody's fat  Fucking precious  I'm fat  And I'm telling you  I look to nap  Anytime I can  That's not appropriate  Man  Inappropriate napping  Is what I'm looking to do  I'd go as far to paint eyes  On my eyelids 
[02:12:30]  You know  Just  That old gag  Just to fucking take a nap  And these people  Are just  Angry  And they  They're lazy  Are they really doing their jobs  I don't even know  They're not  I don't know  It's just a power trip  It's not like  You're feeling  I don't feel safer  I just feel  Do you see when  You send your shit  Through the x-ray machine  That person that's just  Looking at  One thing after another  All day long  Do you think they're  Being attentive to  Every fucking little  Thing inside 
[02:13:00]  Every fucking bag  That goes through  When you look at the TSA  As much as  I think Patrice and I  Are in the same  I resent being told  What to do  By people I don't respect  Like if they were all  Cops there  And men who I thought  Were like fucking  Border patrol  You would strip down  To nothing  More respect for their  Authority and their  Ability to catch something  It's like the feeling  You get when you go  Through customs  Like that's kind of  Like oh fuck  The guys have guns  This is authority  I like your point Jimmy  I've met some customs guys  But they're more  No but Jimmy's making  A good point  If you feel like  They have real authority 
[02:13:30]  You don't mind as much  Right  That's what it comes down to  Yeah you want  You want our elite  Protecting  That understand power  Then you'll do  Whatever the fuck  They say  When that's the same  Chick that could be  At fucking Popeyes  Behind the counter  Going what  Can I help you  And it's the same  Fucking woman  You know what  I wonder what  The real drop off is  From being a TSA  Precious broad  To Popeyes  Is it that close  You just don't  You don't get the TSA job  Next thing you know  You're fucking doing  No criminal record  And that's it  Doing some Popeyes 
[02:14:00]  Yeah yeah  Cause there's no physical  Anything you gotta do  No no  Part of it is  It's a deterrent though  It's a deterrent  When's the last time  9-11 they brought on  Stuff that was allowed  Mace was allowed  At that time  So are box cutters  It's hysterical  Richard Reed  Was from a foreign flight  And now there's  Shoe Shacky  When's the last time  Something devastating  Got through on a plane  It doesn't happen  I'm not sure  Here's where I step it up  I'm not positively sure  Like  The  The last African kid  That was supposed to 
[02:14:30]  Blow up the plane  In Detroit  Right  I'm not positively sure  That happened  I just believe  Real  Yeah  I believe that they  Can lie  They'll be just  Fed information  You know these  These weird movies  And shit  And you see them  And you just  I just kind of believe  That maybe some  Indescript  Human being  Was made up  And  And  And  They say he had  An underwear bomb  And it didn't go off  And now we're willing  To just  Fuck  All it takes  Is the threat 
[02:15:00]  But what about the people  All the people  On the plane  That saw the smoke  I don't  Who  I don't know  I don't  I don't  I don't  I don't  Listen  That's what I'm saying  I don't  It's kind of hard  To get a plane load  Of people  And why an African  With an underwear bomb  They'd come up  With something more  Devastating than an African  With an underwear bomb  This is  Look  You  You will easily  Destroy what I'm saying  I'm saying  That  It's  It's  Keep the fear going  And you'll keep people  Complying  It's just  Fear  Fear  Fear  And we go  Okay  Yes  Just take 
[02:15:30]  What you want  We have to  The president  You know  This is a sad thing  Because this is why  Growing up  Growing up black  In a poor area  And education  Is not important  Well tell me about it  It's made to be  It's made to be  Really  They call you white  When you try to learn  Okay  But now I'm  Irrelevant age  I'm getting that age  Where no one gives a fuck  And  And  I realize  Look  What the constitution  Is right now 
[02:16:00]  There's a point  To separating  Congress  The president  And  The supreme court  And so no one  Has one  Right now  We are  In a place  Where the constitution  Was created  To stop  Where if a  Motherfucker  They taking guns  And a motherfucker  And they controlling  The news  These are the first  Two things  Freedom of press  And the guns  To protect ourselves  From a tyrant  In case 
[02:16:30]  In case  He's a traitor  And becomes a dictator  Now that the president  Can just declare war  Without congress  And without  We're in the spot  This is the place  That the fucking constitution  They didn't want us to be  Yes man  Yeah  I mean  And to me  Growing up  That was all white boy shit  The constitution  All white boy shit  Freedom of press  Suck a dick  Crackers in the hills  And shit  Niggas want their guns  And their rifles  Fuck these crackers  Old time western motherfuckers 
[02:17:00]  But now you see  But you see it unfold  Bush did it  But now Obama's living  Under that thing  And now white people  Are scared  And when they get  Another white boy in  It's like  But now he's  The next level  To  Or you think Obama  Was just a buffer  Between Bush  And the next level  Of white guy  That's gonna  He was there  To make niggas  Complacent  Niggas is still  It's been  It's been almost  Two years  Yeah  Niggas is still like  Alright look  He's only been in office  Three and a half years  Like 
[02:17:30]  They know  We're gonna be  Controlled  By race  We get controlled  By that  We don't want to  Agree with white people  You know what I mean  But as soon as he leaves  Because he's done  He didn't realize  He's on vacation  He's just on vacation  All the time now  He's looking at his thing  How many vacation days  I got  I'm gonna take it  I wonder if he took  All his vacation days  Because he's fucking  He didn't realize  This was gonna be  What it was  When they told him  He was gonna get the job  Yeah yeah  Who does 
[02:18:00]  You're it  But who does  The bit where  You become president  And then they show you  What's going on  In the basement  To you know  Get you in line  Oh yeah  I've heard that one  What bit  Who does it  One of our guys  Five different angles  Of the Kennedy assassination  It might be Bill Burr  I think it was Billy  It's like yeah  They take you downstairs  And so you have  Five crystal clear  Different angles  Of the Kennedy assassination  That no one else  Has ever seen  It's like ah yeah  Here's how shit works  We got some stuff  To show you  Before you actually  Take office  And you walk out  Of the room  With a little more  White in your hair  Yeah yeah  I'll bet you  Bill Burr does it 
[02:18:30]  As a bit  And in serious discussion  As well  One of those weird things  Of course  He either makes you  Laugh about it  Or he's crying alone  About it  Psychopath  Bill's hysterical  I kind of like it though  I love it  Seems like it might be  Sort of true  But you see this shit  Because I believe  Obama really thought  He could change the world  He hasn't really  Who the fuck  Who the fuck teaches you  Oil spills  In president class  Nobody  He's not ready  For this shit  No not at all  He's done  He's just going  He's like  Get me out of this man 
[02:19:00]  He's getting me  Impeach me  I don't give a fuck  You think every president  Sists there and goes  I would have been  A great president  If only blank  Didn't happen  Because they all  Have one  They all have something  They all have one  Reagan had a perfect  Eight years  He didn't have shit  Happening  The economy didn't fall apart  He had things that  Kind of worked out well  Seems like every president  Had something  Where if they didn't have that  Poor people hated him  Not people who count  Didn't he have Pan Am  Lockerbie  Lockerbie  That was Reagan  That was a big one  But he handled it 
[02:19:30]  He handled it  He made shit work for him  Like no matter what happened  The shuttle  Exploding  The Iran Contra  But by that point  He was just like  I don't  I don't remember  I know Jimmy  Jimmy Carter  For some reason  I was too young  But for some reason  This country  Hates Jimmy Carter  Yeah  He stunk  I don't know  I don't know why  He just came across  As kind of wimpy  People see him as also  A lot of the time  The source of  Again the source of  The troubles in the Middle East 
[02:20:00]  Because he gave  He took the Shah of Iran  Sanctuary to the Shah  And when the Ayatollah  When they overthrew him  And they wanted him back  Badly in Iran  Yeah  They were very very angry  By the way  It was Bill Hicks  Of course it was Bill Hicks  I should have known that  Fuck  Dummy I am  Jordan thank you  Yeah it's a Bill Hicks bit  About showing the president  With you know  The basement  Or something like that  We got that clip  Maybe we can play that  Into break for everybody today  Yeah I think  I think  I think he's  You know  He's done  And I think he's just 
[02:20:30]  He's gonna coast through  He's gonna ride now  Because who would take  This many vacations  I think he knows also  They're gonna lose  The majority in November  So he's not gonna be able  To really have  That pull  Of getting everything through  That he wants  He can't even do it now  Yeah  Even with the majority  Because too many Democrats  Are scared shit  Of losing their jobs now  Yeah people are against them  They're all backpedaling now  All these Democrats  Are like  Fuck the mosque  And this  Yeah  Fuck the mosque  Ugly Supreme Court  That he's  This 
[02:21:00]  Ugly  What is going  What the fuck  Is he  Putting up  12 Janet Reno's  To fucking  What the fuck  Is wrong with him  But this is  How many good looking  Ones are there  To choose from though  When you think about it  But good god  How many good looking  Girls go into that line  I think it's smart  You don't want them  Distracted by sex  They're not thinking sex  They're not having sex  Can I get a fucking  A white bearded dude  For like just  Give me somebody  Like a  Give me a dude  Look at these ugly women

[02:24:00]  But even  Even if you're  You know if you're a 9-11  Conspiracy person  You know what I mean  I am  But still at the same time  What it seems to be  Is that they're doing it  Why  Why do that  Why not put it  Why not put it on Bleecker Street  Why put it  Yeah  There  For what  Too close  And here's the big problem with Muslims  From  Not  Not nation of Islam  But  Fucking  Middle East  Yeah  They have not joined us yet

[02:30:30]  Here's the rest of the clip  You're out  The constitution says  Everyone has freedom of religion  Shut up  We understand that part of the argument  How many times does everybody have to say  That isn't the point that's being questioned  We're talking about insensitivity here  You fucking dummy  Of course they have a right  A constitutional right  Everyone knows that  The fact that they want to do it  The fact that they want to do it  And they don't like  Understand how shit  When all these people come out  Going we find that horribly offensive  The fact that they wouldn't go  You know what  Let's try to work something out here 
[02:31:00]  Because we want to be reasonable  No one's saying they can't do it  You idiot  We're basically saying  Could you please maybe move it somewhere else  That's the argument  Unreasonable  Right  They don't want to be reasonable  No one is saying  The thing is going to be built  It's a victory  Following the constitution  We get that  It is a victory for them  Like they're erecting a fucking castle  On a battleground  Where they won the battle  And they hate the Twin Towers  Exactly  That's what they're doing  And they're going to be making  There's going to  And look  Here's something else  People are crazy man 
[02:31:30]  It's going to put your people  In bad trouble  People are going to come down there  You don't think there's going to be defacing  Come on man  At least deface the place  Why do that?  Who's going to build it  And then the guys that decide to build it  They're going to have problems  With other people that don't want them building it  Maybe this weld isn't as good as it should be  How about some of that shit  When they build it  I didn't even  Holy shit  Some of the workers  It's like some big iron fucking beam  Maybe this weld is a little cold  The fucking altar candles 
[02:32:00]  Everything's made out of fucking  Some kind of weird  They put asbestos  Oh yeah we didn't get them cold  No asbestos  Look at that I have the mesothelioma  I have to call binder and binder  If you're a Muslim  Who has a bad cough  After experiencing moss dust  Call  Moss dust  Call moss  Fucking  What's his name?  Vaughn?  What's the guy's name?  He got a name?  Vaughn from off  Oh yeah  Or  Konisberg  That other guy 
[02:32:30]  Fucking  Asbestos specialist  The mosque is high  Of Freinberg and Freinberg  What?  What?  A quote in the constant  We got that  Have you been reading in the mosque?  Blocks north of the proposed mosque  Near ground zero  The constitution says  Everyone has  We know  Freedom of religion  We know  Doesn't matter if it's two blocks  From a building  That was there  Or if it's on top of it  No not that was there  That was knocked down  Yes  By people representing that religion 
[02:33:00]  You fucking  Stop trying to tell  Like it's this irrational reaction  By Americans  It's not  I've never heard Americans  Complain about a mosque going up  We have never  Given a shit before  How many mosques you build  Where you put them  How tall they are  I don't know  Except now  Or give a fuck  Where they are  I never thought about it  This seems to be the first one  That we care about a little bit  We've never cared  Right  That's a very good point  It's not Islam  If fucking the nation of Islam  If Farrakhan and them  Want to build 
[02:33:30]  What they thought  Was a Farrakhan mosque  Close  Yeah  No one be  They'd be like  Eh  Because he's  It's not  It's Arabs  It's big bearded imams  Imam  It's big bearded  It's hot looking women  If you're an imam  That has been breathing in his cusses  Coming up their face  It's  It's  Come on man  Levy Phillips and Cornersburg  Treated me like a real person  During my hardest time  I love that 
[02:34:00]  How come they won't  Just understand that a little bit  It's everywhere  Because they're not reasonable  They do understand  They don't care  Why do that  Why do that  They want to have that  Smelly fucking  No shoot  Motherfucking  And white women  Are always ready  To fucking  Good lord  Defend  Yeah  Just defend them  They don't understand  It's a freedom  They don't understand  How far it would go  With Americans  If they said  We didn't  We weren't thinking  That this would be so offensive  But it is  We want to  We don't want  Islam to be offensive  If they volunteered 
[02:34:30]  To move it  Because they realized  How offensive it was  People would go  Oh wow  That would be more  Bridging a gap  They have no idea  How to interact  With Americans  They're force feeding  This shit down our throat  I know  It's a whole  Yeah  Mosque center  Yeah  We would never  Force feed something  Like democracy  On a nation  In their country dude  Back when  You know  When Saddam was running  Running shit  And all that  They don't pull that shit  It's like that  Like I said  In the movies  When the dude 
[02:35:00]  Gives you the speech  The bad guy  Gives the good guy  That speech  That speech  Like you  Americans  You let us  Do what we want  We do what we want  You have your rules  You must adhere to  Yeah  Like that's what this is  It's like  Not today  And I'm not  It's just  Why do that  Yeah  What the fuck  Why do that  To prove  It's a victory  It's a point proven  Look at Time Magazine  Is America Islamophobic 
[02:35:30]  It says it right  On the cover  Of Time Magazine  Islamophobic  Yep  How about  Is Islam  Unreasonable  How about  Are Muslims  Unreasonable  Yeah  Why won't Time Magazine  Ask that question  Alright here's the rest  Of the club  I'm not yelling  Is there  Or if it's on top of it  They have a right  To build what they want  And there are already  Many mosques  In the Islamic cultural centers  In New York  If you say that  These people  By virtue of the religion  That they practice 
[02:36:00]  Don't have that basic  First amendment right  Then who's next  Whoever  No one is  Whatever  Who's next  And why are they  Only interviewing  Those people  Look at this  Greasy fucking disaster  Jesus  Oh he's angry  And smelly  The words were harsh  The mood heated  And there were  Some minor scuffles  But police maintained  Order  Separating supporters  And opponents  Around the corner  From the proposed project  We say no  To racist fear  Muslims are welcome here  While this way 
[02:36:30]  Out on the street  Daisy Khan  College assholes  It's not about hate though  The leading developer  Spoke out on ABC's  This week  We are deeply concerned  Because this is like  A metastasized  Daisy Khan  Antisemitism  Khan said it's important  To go forward  With the project  But did open the door  To the possibility  Of moving it further  From ground zero  Of course  Good  Saying its backers  Are open to meeting  With the local community board  Again  The controversy 
[02:37:00]  Has former mayor  Ed Koch talking  He wants to see  Tolerance  On both sides  You have a right  To have the mosque  Under our constitution  We know that  You also  From a personal point of view  You ought to consider  The rights  And sensitivities  Of those who died  That's exactly what I have  Predicted that they will  They will not put it there  Yeah I don't think so  Too many democrats  Who are typically very  When Howard Dean  Comes out  And Harry Reid  Come out  When you are losing  People that far 
[02:37:30]  On the left  They know though  Their jobs are in  Jeopardy in November  It doesn't matter why  I think that the whole  Country is so against it  The pressure will  Eventually  Get them to move  The developer is saying  No fucking way  It is going there  They don't care what you say  I think the developer  Has a great interest  In saying that  The Jewish guy  Is he the owner  The guy that owns  The guy that owns  I don't know  Is he a Jewish guy  Well he's  The Jewish guy  Owns all that  He owned all that shit  Here's the rest of our  Accents  And who's next  Reverend Engel 
[02:38:00]  Praised the mosque's  Imam Faisal Abdul-Raf  As being a man  Who wants to promote healing  Oh really  How do you heal  Away from where the wound is  The wound is here  And they caused it  Oh my god  This country is insane  You know  I just hate  The fact  Please  Put all these motherfuckers  In a time machine  It's insane  And send them down there  On September 11th 2001  So they could just  Fucking see this shit  You know  That's a very  Very valid thing  To do with a time machine 
[02:38:30]  What I would do  Is just go ahead  A couple days  And see the Powerball numbers  You would actually  Have a real thing  To do with your time machine  To help people learn  And be strong  And steadfast  And make them remember  What it fucking felt like  To see those towers  Fucking exploding  I mean  Stop it  Of course  I would  Like go back  And actually  Stop it from happening  Exactly  You know  It's fucking hilarious  Norton's time machine  Use is much better  What the fuck  Would you do  Besides go  Someone's gonna 
[02:39:00]  Hijack planes  And fly them  Into the building  And then  And then  They're gonna  Get arrested  And still be in jail  To this day  Yeah yeah  He knew beforehand  Of course he knew  Nobody would do anything  Nobody would do anything  Because as unreasonable  And idiotic  As people are now  They were the same way  In September 10th 2001  They wouldn't have believed you  Hey can't judge you  A book buyer  No they wouldn't  God how frustrating  Would that be  Oh fucking  That you couldn't do anything  Guys are walking out  With ticking hats  How do you feel about  People jumping out of 
[02:39:30]  Builders and on fire  Trying to say  Yeah yeah  When people  This is America  They make you do things  There is a basic principle  Of the people's rights  To do it  Why shut up  Flaming people on fire  Falling  Shut up  There's a basic rights  For people that  Our own countries  Do not respect  So we come here  And shove it  To your stupid faces  Exactly 
[02:40:00]  If I steal  If I steal  Some candles  They cut my hand off  My hand  And shove my hand  On my ass  But then  If I cheat on my husband  They bury me up to my neck  And hit me in the head  With rocks  With rocks  Until I am dead  I love  I love my land  There is  In Saudi Arabia  And then they send  All the fucking money  Back home  Yeah  To fucking rock head land  Rock head  They're fucking simple  In Saudi Arabia  Now they're  I guess  Amnesty International 
[02:40:30]  Is trying to intervene  In this case  Where a guy  A couple of years ago  Hit a man with a shovel  During a fight  And paralyzed him  So now  They are going to  Surgically  Paralyze this man  Do you know what  And just paralyze him  Exactly like the other guy  Is paralyzed  So they're trying to  Amnesty International  Is trying to step in  And go  This is torture  Fuck Amnesty International  With that one  You like that  Absolutely  Because that's  It's kind of brutal  No with adultery  I kind of like it 
[02:41:00]  You should be able  To make it reversible  At least  Sentence him  To maybe  20 years paralysis  It's like  20 years of  Paralysis  But then you're going  You're going to  Need some time  To get those muscles  Working again  After 20 years  Just take my  Hip plug  My hip cord  And just put it  In the refrigerator  And then put it back  Maybe like in 20 years  And it's all dependent  On the crime 
[02:41:30]  Obviously  Like they paralyze  Just your pinky  From some way  Maybe they take your arm  Paralyze that  For a few years  Like 15 years  Paralysis  There would be a lot  Less crime  I think  In America  Amnesty International  Should worry about  People being stoned  For adultery  And not a guy  Who actually  Brutalized somebody  With a shovel  Fucking  What do you think  You do your last night  Out before that  Operation  You probably  Don't even get laid  You probably  Just wiggle your toes  And fingers  What are you doing  I'm not going in  Tomorrow  Yeah  Going in to be  Paralysed  You fuck everything 
[02:42:00]  Doing some jumping jacks  Yeah that's pretty brutal man  You eat with two spoons  And you're just like  And your feet  With your feet too  Playing the piano  With your feet  While you're eating  You're just trying shit  You beat your wife  One more time  You commit one more  Honor killing  You hit one more man  With a shovel in the head  Cause he fucking  Had something in his eye  And you thought  He was winking at your wife  You fucking might as well  Paralyze another motherfucker  Yeah  I think they do  I won't just paralyze 
[02:42:30]  Half my body  Holy shit  And I just have to walk  In a circle  I just like  I just like that  It's temporary though  That's funny man  I don't get how  People like  If it was  Fresh after 9-11  And the rubble  Was still smoking  Down there  Do you honestly think  This would be an issue  A mosque being built  Next  Do you think  You wouldn't be able  To  100%  Of the public  And politicians  Would come out  And go  There is no way 
[02:43:00]  We are allowing this  To go up  Americans are idiots  They're being violent  And I'm a conspiracy guy  But we're idiots  After a little time goes by  I'm a conspiracy dude  So I'm  You know  I'm  I'm  Believing in all that other shit  But  It's the sensitivity part  It's just the part  It's like  Why  Dude  Don't do that  Don't  Just don't do it  Don't put it there  Just slap in the fucking face  I'm having a tough time  With that as well  Just don't put it there  I understand the constitution  I understand that  Nobody's  Just don't do it  You'll be able to build it there  If that's what you choose  In the end  Unfortunately  Oh can you put that back up  I'm just
