<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing attack on Orlando radio host Jim Phillips, whom the hosts (Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton), along with Martini Steve (in studio), labeled a "phony," "liar," and "asshole."  They detailed how their listeners ("pests") had overwhelmed Phillips's phone lines, recounted his on-air responses (including threats of legal action and bizarre tangents about septic tanks), and mocked his perceived self-importance.  Listener calls followed, with Doug from whackbag.com providing extensive commentary on the "attack," Stenchfinger submitting a humorous written account, and a caller describing listeners wearing "Pest" t-shirts at Jim Norton's stand-up show.  Aaron Sheik, a former WWF wrestler, made a brief, unusual call.  The segment concluded with crude jokes about Jim Norton's recent pubic hair shaving.

The show then transitioned to a caller, Marvin from Kentucky, who praised both Opie & Anthony and Howard Stern, despite the hosts' animosity towards Stern. This led to a discussion on pubic hair grooming, prompted by Jimmy’s shaved genitals, with various techniques and aftershave remedies (including baby powder and women's shaving cream) being discussed.  Callers then claimed that Howard Stern had been copying bits from their show, providing specific examples.  A "Guess What's in My Pants" segment followed, where a caller, Wendy, while at a gas station, made sounds by rubbing her phone against her genitals; the hosts correctly guessed she was hairless ("wood floor").  Technical difficulties briefly interrupted this segment. The first hour ended with a discussion of the weekend's top-five box-office movies, interspersed with more listener calls, including more "fuck you" messages and general banter.  The hosts also expressed their dislike of movie theaters and the sounds of people eating popcorn.

The next segment focused on Jim Norton's recent experiences: a frustrating movie outing marred by noisy patrons and the applause after *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*, and a Broadway trip where he met Alan Alda, Jeffrey Tambor, and Tom Wopat, and interacted with a woman resembling him.  The conversation transitioned to movies and theaters, featuring calls from Krista, a blind woman from Long Island, and exploring the possibility of her providing movie reviews.  Norton's violent destruction of a malfunctioning computer mouse dominated a significant portion of the segment, leading to a discussion of his cluttered desk, his issues with Dell computers, and a listing of the items on his desk.  Finally, news items were discussed, including a Times Square security alert ("Times Scare") and suspicious packages in NYC, and the death of Sir Richard Doll.  The segment ended with a discussion of Norton's home movie featuring a young woman.

The show continued with a segment featuring Opie, Anthony, Jimmy, Eric, and Fred engaging in various tangents, including a discussion of a listener's offensive comment, followed by graphic descriptions of violence.  A legal dispute involving a cease and desist order was mentioned, and speculation about a caller who was cut off ensued.  The hosts then discussed a 9-1-1 call involving O.J. Simpson and played the audio clip, followed by prank calls impersonating O.J. Simpson making threats.  Opie's consumption of a three-hour-old tuna fish sandwich was discussed, along with a poker game story involving Billy Zabka, and crude jokes about a news story involving Steve licking a flavored condom and MySexyStore.com.  A lengthy in-studio interview with the band Mudvayne followed, covering their tour experiences (including encounters with Black Sabbath), creative process, reactions to criticism, and the origin of their band name. The segment was heavily punctuated by vulgar language and crude humor.

The final segment featured a phone call-in portion interspersed with Mudvayne (Chad and Matt) in studio. Listeners called in with questions about Mudvayne's gigs. Jay Moore, an actor, called in, and the conversation quickly devolved into sexually explicit jokes and stories, including a graphic anecdote about a naked man in a hotel room.  The hosts and Moore engaged in prolonged ribbing, referencing his personal life and relationship with Nicky Cox.  Mudvayne remained largely silent, occasionally answering questions.  The segment concluded with Mudvayne playing their single, "Forget to Remember."

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  And these dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Spen looks like a tall baby.  Spen looks like a tall baby.  Oh, he's laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Spen, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited.  Huh?  To a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Tell them all exactly.  O-N-A, why are you wrong? 
[00:04:30]  O-N-A, why are you wrong?  We look like assholes right now, man.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  Do you want to kiss me?  I kiss you on the mouth.  You blew it!  Pardon my friends, but you're an asshole.  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony.  Call me sir, God damn it. 
[00:05:00]  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please follow the police.  That's an attention getter.  Beyond AM, Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Hoo-ha.  Hoo-ha.  Hoo-ha.  Hoo-ha.  Hoo-ha.  And welcome to the O-P and Anthony program.  Another week begins on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:30]  We like to call it the O-N-A virus.  Yes.  Hello, pests.  The disease that is this program.  Hello, pests.  Hi.  How was everyone's weekend?  Very good.  Nice.  Relaxing.  I did nothing.  It was probably the most relaxing weekend I've ever had in my life.  Yeah.  And some dope in Orlando threatened us with all sorts of lawsuits saying we were going to have  a horrible weekend.  You know, I did have a horrible weekend, actually. 
[00:06:00]  I didn't know what wax to put on my surfboard.  The conditions out there, out east on Long Island, were a little tricky.  A little tricky for waxing up your board?  Yeah.  That was my biggest dilemma this whole weekend.  I didn't know which wax to use, Anthony.  Wow.  Fucking, I hate, hate the rest of radio.  I fucking hate them.  Except for our pals.  We have a few there that still do Honest Radio, and they'll be rescued. 
[00:06:30]  And they try to work hard, and they try to be original and come up with their own stuff.  You know the names.  Ron and Fez.  You got BJ Shea.  You got Scott Farrell.  Even Shred and Reagan.  Yeah.  In Buffalo, they do a pretty good job.  You know, but then the rest of this fucking business is just made up with a bunch of  phonies, a bunch of liars that could just go on the air and just lie about everything.  Yeah.  Well, that's obvious.  I don't really have time for that bullshit.  This guy, Jim Phillips, down in Orlando, is the biggest joke in radio. 
[00:07:00]  I had no idea.  Oh, my God.  Just when you thought you had seen the biggest ass wipe on radio, this guy comes into play.  They're all from the same mold.  That's why I hate them all.  He sounds like Likus, who sounds like Don and Mike, who sounds like Shannon Burke, who  sounds like Lex and Terry.  They all have the same voice, who sounds like Man Cow.  Yeah.  No one uses their real voices on the radio. 
[00:07:30]  They put on this thing, this voice that they put on.  It's got to be the radio guy voice.  So it makes them so cool and so hip, it doesn't matter what's coming out of their mouths.  It's just cool because they're saying it like this.  Ugh.  Don't you just...  How do you keep that on your radio when somebody's puking like that?  Ugh. 
[00:08:00]  I just got distracted watching this girl dive off the diving board and slam her face into  it.  Oh, they have video of that?  Oh, it's fantastic.  I saw the still shots in the paper over the weekend.  I didn't know they had video.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Because the still shots in the paper, there's one, you can see that the blood is just spraying  out.  They'll play that over and over again.  8,000 times.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, because it's very important to show that on the news.  Yeah.  Just in case you're doing a double backflip.  Right.  You know, you want to protect the kids.  You want to smash your face on the board.  See, kids, if you try that maneuver, this could happen. 
[00:08:30]  Shut up.  Well, I guess everybody was so worried about us over the weekend, Opie, because this dick  bag was making these threats about some kind of legal action.  First of all, over the weekend.  Shut up.  What Clear Channel or any lawyers are working on the weekend?  Stop it.  The sad part is we have more friends in Clear Channel than he does.  Exactly.  And he works for the company.  The guy doesn't realize what a small nothing he is and how much his own company really doesn't 
[00:09:00]  care about him.  Do you think they're going to jump if this nobody just starts crowing that he's angry  and needs some legal assistance?  Like, they're all going to drop everything to help this guy out?  His little perception of his self-importance is a little overblown.  And then there's really nothing he can do.  And the fact that he lies about everything made it just that much funnier, where he's 
[00:09:30]  going off and you're just listening and going, oh, you're embarrassing yourself again.  No one's believing it.  You're a nothing.  And you're a liar.  And that's what he did again on Friday.  The attack continues.  And the pests just tied up his phone line so he couldn't do a show.  Just like we predicted, he couldn't take one phone call.  And I'm not going to be a phony.  I won't be a phony like this guy is.  This guy is such a phony. 
[00:10:00]  He talks about how people had listened to their show and told me that they were saying this.  Can you even be honest for a second with your listeners?  Can you just be honest and say on your way home, whatever, we're replayed throughout  the day, whatever time it was, that you tuned in to the show to listen to what we were saying  about you?  Why can't you just be honest with that?  I was listening to his program because it's a pisser listening to our pests just nail this  guy to the wall, listening to that cackling, that cackling pork chop lap that sits next 
[00:10:30]  to him just adding nothing to the show.  Listening to that, I found it hysterical.  It's my favorite new show.  I can't stop listening to it.  I cannot stop.  XM 152, this guy is a hoot.  It is so god-awful that, yeah, I was listening to the pests mount their assault.  I'm on message boards.  I'm on the chat rooms. 
[00:11:00]  And it's fun watching this coordinated little attack on this idiot.  And he, again, had nothing.  I got the update.  Not one phone call all day or something?  Not one call.  And he thinks it's great that he showed the listeners, our listeners, that he didn't take  any calls.  But he doesn't understand.  The fun part is the fact that you couldn't take one fucking call.  You nothing.  That he had to sit there and talk about septic tanks. 
[00:11:30]  I thought he told everybody to bring it on, right?  Didn't he say bring it on?  Bring it on.  Give me what you got.  Dude, that slob with tits that sits next to him went off on septic tanks for multiple breaks.  It didn't stop.  It went on and on about septic tanks and what type of stone leeches the fluid into the ground  better. 
[00:12:00]  It was awful.  She looks like Paul Stanley.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shoot.  The photoshops that were going on on the message board with her picture and his picture.  I never saw so many pictures of big cocks going into his ass.  Did you read the Moira appreciation thread on the white bag?  Oh, bravo.  Oh, what a bunch of heartless assholes on that message board.  Yeah, if you're new to the show, you might want to go to whackbag.com to, you know, find  out exactly what we're talking about here.  Update the whole thing. 
[00:12:30]  He's just this tool in Orlando that does a talk show who thinks he's bigger than he really  is.  And I know the one market wonder.  He does great in Orlando, and congratulations for that.  But you're not in our league, so just relax, buddy.  And this isn't about us and you, trust me.  It's a much bigger issue we have with commercial radio.  You're just the latest guy we're picking on.  That's it.  We hate you all.  Bullies.  He was calling you bullies.  What kind of a guy yells, bring it on, and then calls bullies?  What the fuck?  What are you, five years old? 
[00:13:00]  We stand up to bullies.  No, you don't.  You kneel down, open your mouth, and don't take any phone calls.  That's what you do to bullies.  Stupid.  He was griping.  He goes, okay, I hope you have a good weekend.  I hope your weekend doesn't have a surprise in it.  Why don't you look up things like tort?  And look up things like injunction.  Tort?  Tort.  Ah, shit.  I looked up tort.  Oh, you did?  Fuck.  Yes, it had a picture of him and his co-host. 
[00:13:30]  Tort.  I brought in a nice picture of a cherry pastry.  I look up tort killer.  What a complete ass.  What a phony, what a chill-inducing embarrassment this guy is.  You listen, and you're so embarrassed.  There were so many occasions where he would be yapping, and I couldn't look at anyone else.  Because you're so full of embarrassment for the guy?  Yes. 
[00:14:00]  You're embarrassed for him.  Do you realize that people are embarrassed for you?  You're supposed to be funny?  Like, that's supposed to be a funny show, and his answer is, look up tort?  Look up tort.  You groveling commercial jizzbag.  Is that the best you have?  Look up legal terms?  You're not a funny guy, man.  You're not a funny human being.  He was coming up with, like, the Patriot Act and how lawyers are working as he spoke to go through all the emails and phone calls. 
[00:14:30]  And anyone knows, here's the biggest giveaway.  Well, the fact that he's just a compulsive liar on the air, he can't be honest with anybody.  That's one thing.  But the fact that if you consult a lawyer about anything, especially on air, and believe me, me and Op have had plenty of meetings in chairs sitting in front of lawyers,  the first thing they tell you, the number one thing they tell you is, all right, we're working on this. 
[00:15:00]  Don't address it.  Don't talk about it on the air.  Don't even mention their name.  Don't do anything on the air.  We're working on this.  And you're so frustrated that you're sitting there and you can't talk about it because the lawyers tell you it's in your best interest.  Just don't mention this.  That's when you start listening to people.  Right.  Because it's a legal thing, litigation.  We had a problem a few years back with Dave Herman.  Did the rock and roll morning show on N.E.W. 
[00:15:30]  And we had banged heads there.  We were part of a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Infinity Broadcasting.  I don't think we've ever talked about this on the air.  No, I forgot about it.  Infinity Broadcasting against us.  It was just this big thing that went on that Dave Herman was suing us personally, the station, the company, everything.  And we wanted to go on the air and play the phone call from his wife.  That kind of spurred the whole thing on.  Well, she was having a garage sale. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  It was a garage sale selling all his stuff.  All his stuff.  She calls up.  She calls up to just announce that she's having a Dave Herman garage sale.  So we thought we have to go with that.  It sounded like maybe she had put a few down before the call.  We didn't really get along with Dave Herman at the time.  So the wife was calling and talking about Dave and his stuff that she's selling.  It was classic Opie and Anthony.  So we went on about Dave's parenting skills and his sexual prowess and his ability to be a husband and father and stuff. 
[00:16:30]  And he got upset about it, and he filed a lawsuit.  The lawsuit came about, and I believe it was resolved with the fact that he's a public figure.  It was a parody show, usually how these things end up.  There was wiretapping going on?  There was all kinds of stuff going on.  And the case was dismissed.  Where's Ben?  Ben should be involved in this.  There was this phony that worked at WNEW at the time who made believe he was our friends.  Yeah.  And it turned out he actually dubbed off a tape. 
[00:17:00]  He was taping us when we weren't on the air, trying to catch us in a lot.  Catching us talking bad about Dave Herman and his wife.  This guy, Mark Francis, who sees us from time to time and thinks we're buddy buddies.  Yeah.  Sorry.  No, we're not buddy buddies, Mark.  Sorry.  So...  He was secretly taping us while we were in studio.  The whole thing is, we wanted to get on the air and just start discussing this whole thing.  And the lawyers told us, the Infinity lawyers said, look, you can't talk about this. 
[00:17:30]  You can't even allude to it.  Don't mention it.  And you could go back and listen to tapes of our show when that was happening.  We didn't talk about it.  And we love talking about anything.  We love getting ourselves in fucking trouble.  We've done it in the past.  This was one of those things.  They stress to you, do not talk about this.  Well, he spent another, you know, I guess three hours.  It was an hour of filler on septic tanks and a few other very pressing and funny issues. 
[00:18:00]  Did he really talk about boils and nose hairs?  Yeah.  I think that was another one of the topics.  Hold on.  Let's go to Pete real fast.  Pete, go ahead.  Pete!  Hello?  Yeah.  Great.  Hello?  Phones are working.  I hope they're working.  All right.  Go ahead.  Well, he was just talking about how the lawyers are working on it.  We have lawsuits that are coming our way over the weekend, how we should be petrified while  we're sitting at home shaking over the weekend because he's got things in the works.  And the first thing I thought was that this guy's just a lying sack of shit. 
[00:18:30]  And then, oh my God, you can't even do it well because you're not supposed to talk about  stuff like this if there's actually something going on.  And again, there's nothing.  This guy's a liar.  He says that he'll start taking phone calls again Wednesday because there's some technology  that he's putting in place by Wednesday that's going to screen out our pests and he'll be  able to now take calls, know who's on the phone.  He might even start giving out phone numbers of the pests who absolutely don't care if their 
[00:19:00]  phone number goes out to his listeners.  They love the idea.  Call them all day.  They'll just jerk off and listen to you.  Of course they will.  They will offend the people that are calling to fuck with them to the point where you don't  understand who you're dealing with.  These people are psychopaths.  They're insane.  So they don't care.  And again, he's so small.  He's so nothing.  Do you think he'll be able to call and ask Clear Channel for any new equipment and have  it there in less than a week? 
[00:19:30]  Who do you think you're fucking with?  Do you think we don't know how radio works?  You ask for something.  A year later, you ask for it again.  And in a few months from that, you might get an answer that you might have to ask for it  again in a year.  Shit doesn't work like that, buddy.  You're not getting new shit.  You're not getting new equipment.  It's called caller ID.  You have it already.  Our listeners just don't care.  They don't care.  You know what new equipment you should get?  How about a talent implant?  That'd be nice. 
[00:20:00]  That'd be a fucking funny bone sewn onto you.  Let's go to Doug out Doug from whackbag.com.  Oh, one of the stars.  Doug, what's up?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi.  Where was my voice on Friday, Jim?  Where was my voice?  Did you play my voice on your radio show, Jim?  Well, we didn't have a cease and desist order.  It's called you being a fucking pussy.  Yeah.  You didn't take a single call.  And that made us happy. 
[00:20:30]  Do you know the frustration, guys, that this asshole must have with the fact that he started  his show saying he wasn't going to take any phone calls?  And at 7 o'clock at night, his fucking lines were still busy.  He wanted to deter us from fucking calling.  And until 7 o'clock, those lines were still jammed because we are a bunch of assholes.  He's telling us that we're the ones dumping long-distance money, and we're saying they're  cell phones.  Long-distance is free. 
[00:21:00]  Who cares?  Yeah.  I called and told that crippled cunt that takes the calls, hey, I want to just be on  the air.  I will give out my own phone number.  They don't care.  They don't care.  How many calls am I going to get?  Every time one of his own listeners hears that busy signal, they're tuning in to top  20 fucking radio.  They're not listening to his ass anymore.  His following is dropping every time they hit a busy signal.  And what would be so bad about me getting phone calls from his fans?  The first minute of every incoming call on my cell phone is free. 
[00:21:30]  Who cares?  I get to talk to these assholes.  And make sure you tape them because that'll make for some great radio.  Absolutely.  Yeah, and I already had my tape recorder ready.  Oh, by the way, Mr. Phillips, we're still taking phone calls over here.  Constantly.  We're not scared to do radio, you faggot.  To plunk down every line that's lit.  And he won't say your name.  They're all lit.  The name of the show because his boss has probably said, don't give them any promotion.  Don't say Opie and Anthony.  And there's no way certain things work here.  Opie, Greg and Comey, he won't just say your names because he's been told not to.  Jim Phillips Show, XM 152. 
[00:22:00]  We encourage you to listen.  That's how bad it is.  I am scared of the pests right now.  How about this one?  Because remember, guys, he who laughs last, laughs best.  He actually said that.  He didn't say that.  Yes, Jimmy, I'm sorry to report.  He said that over and over again.  I was on a plane on the other day.  I missed the entire – he said he who laughs last.  Last, laughs best.  And he kept saying it like that was his big catchphrase of the day. 
[00:22:30]  What does he say about he who can't make his listeners laugh once?  How about that?  I got more private messages on Wackbag, emails on my personal email account, and AOL instant  messages through the weekend.  Hey, Doug, did you know about this website that spoofs telephone numbers?  No problem.  We beat your call ID system already.  What's this?  Camophone.com?  Doug, it's C-A-M-O-P-H-O-N-E.com.  Someone told me that this is a site that helps disguise where you call from. 
[00:23:00]  I don't know exactly what it does, but try camophone.com.  Yes, sir.  There's also one called Spooftel.  That one actually allows you to designate what phone number you're calling from.  Wow.  I've never heard of that.  How do you spell it?  How do you spell it?  We already have his home phone number.  We'll all just use that.  Doug, how do you spell Spooftel?  S-P-O-F-T-E-L-L?  Yes, sir.  Dot com?  Okay.  Yeah, we'll just use his home phone number to spoof the telephone number.  We'll still think that he's getting calls from home.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  His number is 888-978-1041, and it's just a laugh riot, guys.  A lot of big laughs on this show.  I talked to one of the pests who came to the comedy show last night, one of the true sociopaths.  Yeah.  And I don't know if he wants me to give out his name, because he said he did this thing  where he hooked up some computer thing where the guy got 1,200 calls on his show, and every  time the phone answered, they would hear, it's the Greg and Tony show, the Greg and Tony  show.  Oh, that's brutal.  He said that it was on a loop, and he said that they actually knew how many times it 
[00:24:00]  had been answered.  Wow.  And how many times it hadn't been.  So that's probably one reason they stopped, is every time they picked up, they would hear  it.  Greg and Tony show.  It's the Greg and Tony show, which for me would be great, because I love that song.  Guys are asses.  Wait, well, one other thing that he was saying about Jimmy, personally, because for the first  two attacks, all he was doing was talking about Anthony Cummia and Gregory Hughes.  Tee hee.  What an ass.  And he finally said, well, what's that comedian's name on that show?  What's his name? 
[00:24:30]  I love how he tries to make it sound like, I don't really know.  Again, he cannot be honest with his listeners.  What's that guy's name?  Jimmy, Jimmy Norton.  Jim Norton.  Why don't you, and this is what he was saying, why don't you book a show down here in the  Orlando area, Jim?  Why don't you do that?  Because I think you'll be surprised when you go down there with, maybe we got a little  surprise for you if you book a gig at a club down here.  Dude, we should book a freaking show this Friday night in Orlando. 
[00:25:00]  Book a show, because you know what happened?  Nothing.  God help the one or two people that would show up that are his listeners.  They would be anally raped.  I don't care if he shows up and heckles, as long as he doesn't pipe in audio of that awful  radio program he does.  Dude, you could show up and murder an animal.  Just don't play any of your god-awful, unfunny show with that fucking box you sit next to.  Horrid classic. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, Doug out.  Yes, sir?  First of all, make sure the Army and the Pest know that they're doing a great job.  We're very proud of you guys.  I've got to give a hat off to these guys.  We've never done three full days, let alone it's going to be four today.  Oh, yeah.  We have the attention span of a flea.  Yep.  Basically, we have grown in numbers all three days and almost doubled every time we've gone  out there.  You know what it has to do with?  It has to do with the fact that this guy is such a pompous asshole that it makes it so 
[00:26:00]  much more enjoyable to fuck with him.  Well, I can honestly say this will probably end with the sharp snapping of a rope he self-tied  to his neck and his ceiling fan and he jumps off of a stool.  We can only hope.  Well, the point I want to make, and you've got to pass it on to everybody else, this is  a much, much bigger problem than this stupid Jim Phillips.  You guys understand that.  It's not us against him.  It's us against pretty much commercial radio in general.  He's just the latest one.  He's the poster boy this week.  He's the poster boy for now. 
[00:26:30]  You know, I don't want him to think that it's us against him because we're in two different  leagues.  We'll just go ahead and pick names out of a hat every week.  I mean, we might as well at this point.  This is a prime example to regular radio, what a lack of power you have, how small fish  you are.  This is a prime example.  And how much we can destroy your program if you want to be an asshole and use that line  like he's using about our three listeners and his bullshit. 
[00:27:00]  This is a great example, a great way to show the rest of regular radio, the tools in  regular radio, what it's like to have our pests on your ass.  Somebody wanted to rent a billboard near his office where the radio station is just  to write, you lose, sir.  You lose, sir.  Good day.  Good day.  One of the boards, if everybody could just give $2, maybe we can get it for a week.  Fucking sickos we're dealing with here. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Doug, are you going to be up in this area, I've heard?  As a matter of fact, I will be on Thursday night.  I believe we're going to the Fat Black Pussycat.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay, yeah, my friend owns that.  Kick at Club.  Kick at Club.  Beautiful.  I'm coming on up for a wedding this weekend and figure it'd be a good opportunity to go  out and drink.  It's Donkey Sausage's birthday.  So we'll have a good time Thursday night.  All right, great, man.  Yeah, because, yeah, no one owns that.  Same guy who owns a comedy cellar owns that place.  You have to come one and come all.  And I think we'll be having a ticker tape parade that night also.  All right, Doug. 
[00:28:00]  See you this week, sweetie.  Take it easy, guys.  Bye, buddy.  Doug out, Doug, from whackbag.com.  Very good.  And the other message boards get angry.  Opianthony.net.  Cringehumor.net as well, all participating.  Yeah.  It's a blast.  It's fun to watch on the message boards.  And it all gets rolling around 2, 2.30.  They start just frothing at the mouth and exchanging ideas and things to do.  And then at 3 o'clock when it hits, it's just, it's so much fun to watch these guys work. 
[00:28:30]  But I want to make it perfectly clear.  This is a very big war.  Mm-hmm.  This is just one tiny little battle over here that we're fighting right now.  Yeah.  I'll take care of this little battle.  Then we're going to move on to other things.  This ass.  This ass has just made it so much fun, is what it is.  Would we have moved on?  We probably would have.  Absolutely.  If the guy handled it differently or something.  We absolutely, yeah, would have just moved on to some other radio asshole that's out there.  This guy is such a complete ass, such a tool, that he's just made it fun to really fuck with him. 
[00:29:00]  What drives me nuts is something going on in commercial radio.  You know, Howard brought this to everyone's attention.  Of course I did.  About this, you know, ripping me off.  And, you know, he did have a valid point.  But now, like we've said, he's become a joke as far as that and a parody of himself.  But, at first, he did make a very good point where a lot of these radio guys were just ripping him off and other people off.  And then, all of a sudden, it just became accepted, if you're doing radio, that you just go on there and go,  Well, yeah, yeah, I did rip off this person or I ripped off that person. 
[00:29:30]  But everyone does it.  It's just known in this business.  Just to have a blanket statement like that, it just is disgusting.  Disgusting, you know?  Our material stands for itself.  We attempt to be as original as possible.  If we are doing something that is similar to some other guy, we always try to throw our own little spin on the damn thing.  There you go.  But a bunch of these radio guys out there now, you know, because they've been called out on this point for many, many years,  you know, now the latest thing in commercial radio is like, 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, everyone rips everyone off.  Yeah, what are you going to do about it?  Just what we do.  Showing no originality whatsoever.  And that's what drives me nuts.  To just like, you know, blow it off like,  Ah, it's no big deal.  We've been doing it like this for years.  Really?  Really, it's no big deal?  All right.  Have fun.  Have fun today.  It's just going to continue.  No phone calls today again, buddy.  No phone calls.  Bring it on.  Bring it on. 
[00:30:30]  I'll get whatever you got.  Bring it on.  And now he's groveling about lawsuits, bullies,  and I won't take phone calls until I have special equipment.  How could you say that after three days ago you're yelling, bring it on?  He's just a liar.  Yeah.  He's a liar.  Can't even be honest with his own listeners.  He's just a liar.  I've gotten emails from some of them.  They're like, this guy, you see a couple of the posts, his message board is destroyed.  Yeah.  But they're like, this guy really is a tool.  Yeah.  Oh, his own listeners that have been writing?  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  You read a couple of those?  They're great.  They're his listeners just writing about how they listened to him for so long.  And this opportunity came up.  They heard of us, started listening, and they absolutely see what a tool this guy is,  what a complete ass he is.  It's barely what we're doing.  This guy is just showing himself to be one of these ridiculous radio tools.  All right.  Not taking phone calls.  One other thing before we move on, because we just have to do 20, 25 minutes on you, 
[00:31:30]  and then we can move on, because we do a radio show, you ass.  How's your septic tank?  We could still go to the phones and just have a regular show.  Yeah.  But you'll do another, what, two, three hours on us today?  That's what he was saying.  He goes, yeah, I don't have to take phone calls.  I've done shows for years without taking one phone call, so we're going to do that  today.  And then he proceeds to do a show on septic tanks and listening to that hole next to him  cackle. 
[00:32:00]  One thing that annoyed me is when he was going, what's the matter, boys?  You're not playing the audio?  It's like when someone gets a cease and desist, you know it's probably going to come like it  did when you played the M&M stuff.  You can't play it.  The cease and desist comes.  You know that.  So you're just kind of hoping to play it as much as you can before that comes.  And dude, I got to be honest, I really wish you, your audio was pricelessly bad.  Oh.  Pricelessly bad.  And wouldn't it be in his best interest to have his audio played on our show?  Like, if any radio personality that's bigger than us wanted to play our audio, would we 
[00:32:30]  send a cease and desist?  No.  You'd let them play it.  The only way that you want somebody to stop playing your audio is if you even know how  stupid and ridiculous it sounds and how easily it is to goof on.  That hole next to him is so much fun to listen to just chime in with our nothingness.  I was doing that all weekend. 
[00:33:00]  I was going, where's the remote?  Did you hear?  I actually want to hug Moira.  She's so fucking awful.  I want to just hold her and touch her skull.  There was one point where this boar, and I think that people in his studio are uncomfortable.  Yeah.  They're watching a boar unravel.  Yeah.  They're watching him just unravel, and he was going, just rambling about lawsuits and  torts, and she goes, they don't know you very well. 
[00:33:30]  Did anybody out there hear that when she said that they don't know you very well?  It's in the first, I only heard the first five minutes of the show Friday.  Actually, somebody sent me a link to the actual.  Wow.  Listen to the first ten minutes, and you'll hear her say that.  They don't know you very well.  It could be the worst thing I've ever heard anybody on radio say.  That is horrific.  Ever.  That is horrific.  That's great.  I'm broad.  Just do what you do.  Lay back, open legs, mouth shut, pop out, baby.  Continue. 
[00:34:00]  Yuck.  All right, before we move on, Stenchfinger sent this in.  Stenchfinger.  We were listening to this just before we went on the air.  It's a report from the front lines.  This thing is really good.  Yeah.  He put at least five minutes into this thing.  Oh, at least.  No, it's really good.  From Stenchfinger.  Just talking about the battle that was on Friday.  Well, this is really funny because he takes on the whole thing of how it was a tough battle  because they actually have to listen to this program. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Keep that in mind as you're listening to this.  Yeah.  It's a tough battle because they had to sit through his nonsense.  Part of the battle is listening to his show.  Right.  Here we go.  Stenchfinger, everyone.  Sirs, it's bad out here.  Our intel on these bastards was faulty and about ten minutes ago we started losing men like 
[00:35:00]  Sandy Kane in a dating service.  The army expected the standard resistances we'd been trained for.  Screeners, delays, caller ID and overcoming our own speech impediments and low IQs.  But suddenly we realized these fuckers were fighting back.  The lucky ones went first.  A bitter boy was charging the hill when he got hit with a Chick-fil-A commercial that must have been eight minutes long. 
[00:35:30]  Benz Hogg was trying to hold his unit together after a second by Mara took out 43 men.  Their screams were forever on my dreams.  Stealth pain was taken down by a weather report.  A story about French fries took out the entire third cavalry.  PSAs were everywhere, man.  It all happened so fast.  I would like to say that I was brave, sirs. 
[00:36:00]  But I must admit I began to weep when I heard the fourth Watson realty commercial.  I fell on the field, sirs.  And I thought for sure that it was over.  As the monotone drivel of their commander washed over us, I tried to comfort a young man from Indiana.  All he could keep saying was,  Load up the kids and head out to Watermania.  Load up the kids and head out to Watermania. 
[00:36:30]  The life was gone from his eyes.  How are we going to explain to his family what these heartless bastards have done?  Somewhere, I swear I heard a baby crying.  Now, I don't know his name, but he was wearing an Aussie t-shirt and looked like a pasty angel.  He came out of nowhere, sirs.  Lifted me on his shoulders.  We're not leaving any men behind.  And he screamed and lifted me over the FocusOnLearning.org PSA that had filled me. 
[00:37:00]  Before I could even thank him, he was back on the field.  As stalker Patty was tending my wounds, the men let out a cheer.  In the distance, we could see four pests triumphantly hoisting a pair of Pat Battles' dirty underwear on a makeshift black pole.  Ecstasy of the gold began to blare out of Pat from Unaki's Cadillac. 
[00:37:30]  We're taking that heel, sirs.  Tell my wife I love her.  Private Stinchfinger, 34th Infantry Division of the O&A Army.  That rocks.  Goddamn, referring to the bad commercials that you gotta sit through and his babbling and...  Oh, wow, that's hilarious.  Bravo, Stinchfinger. 
[00:38:00]  Good job.  The Water Mania commercial that plays 18 times.  That sounds like the Glory Hole commercial.  Well, the listener's having a lot of fun with this one.  I can't wait until 3 o'clock.  I know, it's so much fun.  I look forward to that show like I used to look forward to doing this show when it was on afternoons.  The joy it brings me.  I can't tell you.  To hear that awful banter.  To see a man unraveling because he's not funny. 
[00:38:30]  Just unraveling.  And his cohorts in the studio listening to it.  And sometimes even chiming in where you can hear what they're saying has a little sarcasm to it.  Like, they're obviously upset with this situation.  Situation.  Let's say hi to Joey in Howard Beach.  Joey!  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How's Fat Nick?  Fat Nick is still in jail.  Fat Nick's mother on 1010 Winds this morning.  I was listening to her comments.  Yeah, that's right.  I saw that.  We ought to pull that off. 
[00:39:00]  She's talking about how her son didn't hit the black guy over the head with the bat.  That he just fell.  He fell down.  And that's what happened.  My son wouldn't have done that.  It was a fight.  Teenagers get into fights all the time.  He fell down.  That's what happened.  Gotta love Fat Nick.  Fat Nick.  All right, Joey.  His mother's like Sonny's mother in Dog Day Afternoon?  Exactly.  I talked to the FBI, man.  He said it's going to be all right.  Run! 
[00:39:30]  Run!  Run!  Fellas, I've done more legal research over this weekend than I do at work than I did  all throughout law school, trying to keep the maniacs on whack bag sane.  You know, like, I knew this guy had nothing to stand on.  And he, first of all, like Anthony said, when you're going into litigation, the last thing  you do is tip your hand.  You're not going to go tell everybody what you're going to do.  And you can't, you can't say bring it on and then say that you're being harassed. 
[00:40:00]  What?  You can't invite a supposed harm against you and then, you know, get pissed off when somebody  does it.  When you realize what you're up against.  Right.  Exactly.  Radio 101.  You know, you want to talk shit while the listeners are responding.  Yep.  Yep.  The Patriot Act?  How do you fight for the Patriot Act?  Like, they're going to help you, the Patriot Act is going to help you get back at people  calling your radio show.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what the...  Yeah, you ass.  There's bombs going off and... 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  There's not enough problems with terrorism in this country that now they're going to  focus on dugout dug.  That's what the government's looking for.  I hope to God he tries to contact people in that whole area because they will lock him  up.  You are a tool.  The Patriot Act.  All right, Joey.  Bye, Joey.  All right, take it easy, fellas.  We should take our first break, huh?  All right.  I shaved my pubes, the upper pubes, and I'm trying to see if it itches or not.  I didn't go all the way down.  I wanted to see what it felt like, and I'm hoping it doesn't start itching like the dickens. 
[00:41:00]  How low are you going?  I left, like, almost like a little Hitler mustache across the top just in case it gets  bad.  I don't want it to be right where my mule meets my body.  Okay, hold on.  I just...  I was reading.  I came in with the Hitler mustache.  I wasn't listening.  I was with Jimmy until he said that.  Not a Hitler mustache.  I'm saying that height.  What did you do?  I shaved my pubes.  What?  Why?  Why?  I just wanted to.  Why not? 
[00:41:30]  How much?  Well, I shaved it down.  I'm not very hairy to begin with.  You shaved the ball back?  No, you're not.  I don't need to.  There's almost no hair.  Oh, God.  It looks like Connor Peterson's chin.  Without the kelp.  Little kelpless chin.  So I shaved the top of the pubic here.  I probably left maybe an inch, like a line.  It's not like a heel that much.  No, I know.  I understand.  But how high is the hair?  Very trim.  I used scissors first. 
[00:42:00]  It might get a little prickly on you.  I'm hoping not.  But I'm going to shave again today in the shower.  I'm going to keep it up.  You're going to keep it up.  We got OzFest tomorrow, too.  Did he use a razor blade?  Dude, when you trim down...  Shave it down, yes.  When you trim down, you've got to be very, very careful.  You go a little too short, it gets prickly.  You get a little porcupine.  No, but I want to go completely bald.  You do?  Yeah.  You're going to shave it all off.  Girls like that.  Not all girls, but some do.  That is such a gay man thing.  No, it's not.  We talk about this from time to time.  I got a shaved bald bag. 
[00:42:30]  I'm not shaving because I keep getting...  Oh, you mean like the whole thing?  You're shaving the whole thing off.  Yeah, I don't go whole thing.  I'm not getting peanuts and corn kernels stuck in my pew.  That's not what I'm doing it for.  Just girls like it better.  They think it just looks nicer.  I'm thinking it might make my hog look a little bigger.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's why I'm trying.  I figure the less there is jutting out...  Right.  You know what I mean?  Well, that is something that's been brought up, the illusion.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you trim the weeds from around the tree, it definitely makes the tree look a little  taller.  I'm actually hoping that somehow, because I'm so pale, that my dick and my stomach will 
[00:43:00]  kind of just blend in as one long thing, and nobody will know where it starts.  They'll just think it's this...  Huge cock.  ...this appendage with nipples on it.  Jesus.  So, I don't know.  Let's see if there's an itch tomorrow at OzFest where we're doing interviews, and I had  this nightmare of talking to Tony Iommi and picking my ball bag and scratching my pubes.  Well, you will be.  You absolutely will be.  It's going to itch on you.  I'm going to shave again.  Especially if you get a little hot and maybe a little sweaty down there, sitting in an  unconditioned environment.  You might have some trouble there, Jimmy. 
[00:43:30]  What made you decide?  I wanted to anyway.  I just decided to do it yesterday.  And you were standing there in front of the mirror, nude?  Yeah.  And you just looked and said, I'm doing it now.  Well, I was shaving my face before my shower, and I'm like, you know what?  While you're here, why not give her a whirl?  And I did it.  I did it in the shower.  I tried to be even with it.  But I didn't shave up.  Somebody told me if you shave up with the razor against the hair, that's when it really  is bad, coming back.  So I shaved down, and I'm going to try it again today just to upkeep.  Have you been using the same razor since, like, 1990? 
[00:44:00]  Oh, no, no.  I change blades constantly.  I'm the blade-changer kid.  No, because we're looking at you.  You really don't have much hair in general.  You know?  No.  I'm very, very smooth and boyish.  Yes, you are.  Everybody goes through three razors a week here.  Yeah, he's a...  And you were probably the same one since, I don't know, last year.  I just use an electric.  You go electric?  I don't even use a regular blade.  It's too much of a hassle.  I just...  That's it.  Go to work.  The hell do I care?  Hey, maybe we could talk about a goatee for three hours.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, vagina face. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, your shirts, by the way, are a little black.  Wow.  Yeah, when we went...  I'm wearing periwinkle today.  When we went after Tom Likas back in the day...  Come on.  ...see another guy we just slapped around at will.  Same voice, different asshole.  And then moved on.  And I want to make that perfectly clear.  I don't want Jim to think he's a special guy.  You're just the guy we're slapping around now.  And we'll move on to somebody else.  Yeah, that's what I was getting at.  So we went after Likas for, you know, for a while.  And the best he had was to talk about ponytails. 
[00:45:00]  Not for a half hour.  For an hour.  Because at the time, I hate to admit this, but Anthony...  Well, it wasn't even that bad at the time.  Anthony had, like, you know, longer hair, and he kept sewing in a ponytail.  Yeah.  Ooh.  So, that's all he had on us.  Yeah, that was it.  That Anthony had a ponytail.  Let's talk about ponytails.  And he did it for an hour.  Oh, God.  These guys have nothing.  They have nothing.  They're incapable of being clever in their viciousness.  Why don't you talk in your real voices? 
[00:45:30]  I would like...  Your co-hosts, because they're all going to listen to this  to see if they're getting slammed.  Why don't you look at him when he's talking  and wonder, why the fuck is he putting on a phony radio voice?  Nobody talks like this.  You have to...  Nobody sits there and puts on this fake voice like this.  No one does that.  Only stupid radio asses.  You can't talk about real issues  if you're too busy worrying about how you're sounding through the speakers.  But that's the whole thing. 
[00:46:00]  They want to sound...  Because when you start doing this, you have to concentrate.  He wants to be so...  He wants to sound cool, you know?  Yeah.  And maybe years ago in the 70s or something,  that was cool to have that voice.  Well, when they had the big boss jocks.  Yeah, boss jocks.  Hey, coming in.  That was five in a row.  You know, maybe that's it.  But now, you know what it sounds like?  It sounds like what you are.  A phony.  You're just an old jock.  He's completely irrelevant.  Thinks he's cool.  Thinks that just by sounding like this, 
[00:46:30]  that people are going to listen.  Was hoping he was going to be syndicated.  Probably gave up on that dream five to seven years ago.  Oh, please.  So, you know, he's a one-market sensation.  That's great.  A lot of people do real well with that.  Yep.  Congrats.  But, Jim, you know you had bigger dreams.  You know you wanted to be kind of like a Sean Hannity, maybe,  or a Rush Limbaugh.  Instead, you're just in one market doing well.  Not even running your own show now.  Hey, by the way, did you see that this is the beauty of this guy? 
[00:47:00]  Did you see WTKS.com if you want to see what he looks like?  It's almost like the usual suspect pose.  Yeah.  It's like he's kind of standing there like a warrior.  It's like, what are you trying, you fucking middle-aged zilch.  Stop trying to be cool.  You're not a cool guy or a funny guy.  You're a tool.  Yeah, I don't know what he's trying to portray himself as.  Chris Rock had a great quote.  I think he said something about cool is the absolute enemy of funny,  or something along those lines like comedy and cool never go together.  If you're going to stand there and try to look cool in your picture, 
[00:47:30]  you're not a funny guy, dude.  Yeah.  Wearing sensitive slacks.  His slacks.  But he's telling us how to dress.  You know what?  We don't really care.  I get a lot of flack about my clothes, but I don't even dress myself.  I could care less.  I love the way you dress.  There's nothing wrong with it.  If you live in Chelsea, it's fine.  I could care less about what I'm wearing on a daily basis.  It's hanging on the knob when I wake up, and I put it on and leave the house.  You should rephrase that, considering the shirt's hanging on the knob. 
[00:48:00]  Take it off with my mouth, throw it over my head.  And I'm the complete opposite.  I just go in my room and look around the piles of clothes and pick up something that doesn't smell too bad  and throw it on for the day.  The point being, he seems to be a lot more concerned about what we wear than we are.  And he, you know, he's such an ass.  And don't threat me, by the way, when I come to Orlando.  That was a threat, by the way.  You know what's going to ruin my act, sir?  My lack of ability. 
[00:48:30]  That's what wrecks me on stage every time, is my complete lack of comedic talent.  You're not going to do anything.  Dick, dick, joke, dick, joke, fart, fart, dick, joke.  Good night, folks.  Thanks for coming.  Selling stuff in the merchandise area.  And who's going to blow me?  Yeah.  Well, apparently no one, if you go to Cleveland, really struck out horribly.  Didn't work out for you.  No.  Wasn't Cleveland the place you said stunk as far as chicks?  No, Philly stinks.  Philly stinks.  Philly girls are gorgeous, but none of them bang.  Collectively, the biggest group of cock teases ever put in one place. 
[00:49:00]  It's amazing how God filtered them all into one bad accent.  I don't know how he did it.  You know?  Really?  I get a lot of emails from chicks in Philly, too, but none of them bang.  It's unfortunate.  And you struck out in Cleveland this time.  Horribly.  Wow.  That's whatever.  I mean, it's fine.  No.  Swing and a miss.  Well, we got Valerie from Ohio.  Ooh.  Valerie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hello.  Good morning.  Hi.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, you were awesome Saturday night.  Oh, thank you.  And the problem with the girls, there were a lot of us there, but we couldn't get to you 
[00:49:30]  because of the pest after the show.  Oh.  Oh, I forgot to mention, during the late show, I have these three kids up front, and all of  them wearing black shirts that just say pest.  Twelve.  And they were, I asked how old they were.  One was like 22, and one was 15, and one was 14.  It was nice to see the generation, the future.  And I brought them on stage and took a picture with these three young, yeah, believe me, these  are the type that, you know, they kill some kind of kid in a satanic ritual somewhere  in the Midwest.  They're just little kooks. 
[00:50:00]  But nice to see the future generation.  Is that what inspired you to shave your sack and your fumes?  I didn't even think of that scene.  Wait a minute.  A nice little 14-year-old boy.  They had pest t-shirts on?  Not like the ones your brothers make them.  They're just black shirts.  Copyright infringement.  Can you say copyright infringement, boys?  I hope you have a good week, young boys.  Because we're sending lawyers.  You better go to a law library, boys, and look up copyright infringement.  And tort.  And tort.  Because you are one.  That's right.  Look up, Tard.  Can you spell Rocky Dennis? 
[00:50:30]  Because that's who sits in the studio next to me.  Oh, but Jimmy, we love you.  So have a separate line for the girls so we can hook up.  Thank you, Valerie.  If you're looking for your official Opie and Anthony pest t-shirt, there's a link on opiananthony.com.  Make it easy that way.  I'm looking for my first Opie and Anthony shirt.  I told my brother.  We've got to get them from Ziggy, I'm finding out.  To spread the virus t-shirts, we've got to get them from Ziggy.  As a member of the program, I would like to have one of those shirts.  It's XL, please.  I would love to wear that.  Ziggy's going to have to bring in some of those spread the virus t-shirts.  And the pest t-shirts are being printed as we speak. 
[00:51:00]  I'm going to go to your brother, actually, for a logo.  I have a logo I want to discuss with him.  He does terrific work.  I've got to tell you.  If you have a company out there, you need a little logo work.  My brother, I'm telling you.  I'm telling you, he does a great, great job.  I'm going to speak to this gentleman.  I don't know your brother.  I don't know what he does.  Tell him I want a logo.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  He does a great, great job.  All right.  We should take our first break, huh?  Mm-hmm.  We've got lots to do.  We'll get into the Cleveland show a little more.  We've got to talk about the Times Square scare.  That's great. 
[00:51:30]  Hilarious.  Welcome to New York.  I'm sorry to say hilarious.  It is hilarious.  You know, but.  It's hilarious.  A lot of people on edge in New York these days, but the front page of the Daily News.  We'll get into that next, okay?  And I have another.  What?  No, I actually forget my thought.  You got a thing?  No, no, no.  I have a technological problem with Dell as well I'd like to get into.  Good luck.  Oh, we've got an update on Anthony's fans next, too.  This is Aaron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion, All-American AAU champion. 
[00:52:00]  Pleasure for me today, Anthony, and I hope you bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans and everybody know I'm the real Middle Eastern man.  Come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world, Manhattan, Madison, Suri Garden.  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American and also my Iranian friend. 
[00:52:30]  I thank you for all my wrestling fans.  I like to say hello to all the Americans, all the Iranians, all the vast to the world.  Pleasure for me to I come back here again one more time to I talk to the Opian and Anthony.  Pleasure for me always.  Who came up with that? 
[00:53:00]  Do we know?  That's hilarious.  Jesus.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Martini Steve in studio.  What's up, Steve?  That was a listener named Travis sent that in, and I just mixed it with the original Ram Jam.  That's hilarious.  Very good.  Listeners are really, really coming to the table lately with material. 
[00:53:30]  Makes our jobs easier.  Thank you very much.  Certainly does.  Yes, I meant to say sensible instead of sensitive.  Oh, jot that down.  You said sensitive slacks instead of sensible slacks.  Josh in New Orleans.  What's up, Josh?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Okay.  That usually means go.  That's funny.  He has no clue.  Josh?  I'm here.  You're on the radio.  Well, I'm an idiot. 
[00:54:00]  Hey, guys.  I'm not going to be able to do this.  You are.  I now know what you are.  All right.  You're working on Norton for shaving his pubes.  I'll just quick line out.  You can let him know that a smaller salad makes your steak look bigger.  A smaller salad makes your steak look bigger.  Oh, there you go.  I like that.  Very nice.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Mike.  Listen, I just wanted to tell Jimmy, I've been shaving my balls for years, like right after  high school.  Just take it all off.  Take it all off.  Deal with the itching for about a week. 
[00:54:30]  And then if you're consistent with it, then it won't itch anymore.  You just have to shave it every day?  That's a great way to get a blowjob.  Chicks love that shit.  Do you shave it every day?  No, no, no.  Not every day.  I shave it like once a week.  If you get a little bit of growth down there, not a big deal.  But you want to kind of keep it.  You want to keep shaving.  I shave it pretty much once a week.  Do you shave against the grain or just with the flow?  Down.  All the way down.  Oh, you don't shave?  At the first time.  It's not.  I'm a Murray, man.  No.  I'm a real fucking man. 
[00:55:00]  You guys talking about this together is so gay.  I'm actually looking for a gentleman to help shave me.  I mean, I don't mean that in any kind of a gay way.  Just somebody who's really well built.  How about a Marine?  I'm telling you right now, guys.  I've been with a lot of girls, and they fucking love it.  Because it's not nasty down there.  They love it.  They're more apt, way more apt to go down there and fucking suck on your balls if there's nothing on them.  You know what the best is, though?  If a girl's licking your balls and you just start turtling against her chin? 
[00:55:30]  Fuck, you guys killed me.  All right, Mike.  See you, buddy.  Thanks.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Let's go to Marvin in Kentucky.  Marvin?  Marvin Nash.  What's up, Marvin?  Oh, not a heck of a lot.  Not a heck of a lot.  Just listening to you guys, see what's going on.  All right.  I figured I'd better kind of express myself.  I'm a fan of the Phillips file also.  I mean, it kind of stinks to hear y'all bashing him.  But, you know, I've learned to respect y'all for what y'all do, the radio station and the big brass balls you have.  And I've kind of respected the Phillips file. 
[00:56:00]  I've listened to him a lot longer than I have y'all.  And it's kind of sad.  But, you know, I respect both of y'all for what you believe in and what you're doing.  Well, it says on the comments here you're torn because you like both shows.  Yes, sir.  You don't have to be torn if you like both shows.  Then like both shows.  The reality is we have real problems with Howard Stern because of some of the crap he pulled behind the scenes when we were working for the same company.  But here's the reality.  There's a lot of our fans that also enjoy Howard.  So this isn't about, well, you better choose one show or the other, God damn it. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, make a decision.  Yeah, yeah.  I hate to be a man on the fence and have to decide.  But, no, sir, I want to listen to both y'all for what you do for the radio.  I mean, I listen to Howard Sterns.  I didn't like him.  In all honesty, I think he's a pompous ass.  I mean, that's my total outlook.  I think y'all are a lot better radio show.  That's why I have to listen to y'all.  Y'all are, you know, more out there, in-your-face kind of radio.  And that's what I like.  Thank you, sir.  And then I go back to, you know, listen to Philip Sala.  He's got his own little personality.  Yeah, you know, he's a little dry. 
[00:57:00]  You know what's great about that?  It's kind of like having a visit with your grandma.  Yeah, yeah.  Without the big...  Every once in a while, you just need that visit from grandma.  Sit down, have some tea.  You've been hanging and partying with your friends and having a good time.  All the weekend.  You're really hungover.  Hanging out.  Chicks, sex, all kinds of fun stuff.  And then sometimes you just want to sit with Grammy.  Sometimes you just want to sit with grandma.  A nice home-cooked meal from grandma.  Yeah, a wholesome kiss.  Listen to her talk about her corns.  Oh, it's cold in here. 
[00:57:30]  It was so damp today.  Yes, exactly.  You've got to admit, dude, even if you're a Philip Sala fan, you've got to admit,  Moira really does say some just nonsensical, unfunny, I need to talk now shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And really, I don't like...  You do hit that pretty much head on.  You know, she does a lot of times say just crap.  You want to just reach over and smack her.  And she stops, you know, Jim from saying things I think it would be a better show if he was  allowed to say. 
[00:58:00]  But, you know, he's on, you know, regular radio, so he can't say crap like that.  Marvin, I'm going to make a prediction.  You call back in two or three months.  You're going to love this show.  You're still a little too new.  You're a little too new still, you know.  People are still trying to figure us out.  You know, they're listening, but they're not really sure.  Trust me, the virus will hit you.  The virus is spreading.  You've got the sniffles right now.  You've got the sniffles.  You don't have the full-blown virus.  You'll be coughing up blood in three months.  That's right.  I hope not, but you never know.  Thank you, Marvin. 
[00:58:30]  I appreciate you all.  I'm going to sign up and let somebody else get in there.  I do appreciate you.  Okay, see, there you go.  Marvin from Kentucky.  And that's how you do Honest Radio right there.  That's what it's all about.  Oh, look at this.  Kelly in Philly.  Kelly.  Hi, guys.  What's up, Kelly?  I want to say, Jimmy, I love that you've shaved because Philly girls are going to do so  much better with a guy that's shaved.  Girls don't like hair down here.  Kelly, Philly girls never let me get far enough to show them because I'm a wispily  pubed man to begin with. 
[00:59:00]  I don't have a lot of hairs down there, as I say.  Just a few.  You get the soft pubes there, Jimmy?  I really do.  What do you get?  Is it like a Chinaman's chin?  You know what it looks like?  Just a few little stragglers.  You ever gently stroke the head of, say, an 18-month-old?  There's hairs on the top of the head, but it's like soft skin underneath.  They're wispy and gentle.  That's what you have down there.  Absolutely.  And my new also smells like Similac.  Huh?  You're not going to have a prickly problem, then. 
[00:59:30]  I hope not.  No, not at all.  I'm not a hairy guy.  My bag is not hairy.  Let me touch it right now.  I don't have to shave.  Oh, stop.  No, no, no.  I'm just talking.  Don't touch it.  Get your hands out of your fucking hands.  My balls are so soft.  I don't shave it at all or clip it.  Those little fellas are just soft.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, what you need to do is you need to shave down first and then shave out to the sides  and then shave up, and that's how you don't get any razor burn.  Okay, thank you.  What do you put on razor burn if you get it, though?  You just kind of have to deal with it.  Usually some lotion helps. 
[01:00:00]  If you're rubbing in there real good, you need to get me to come down there, and I'll help  you out with that one.  Would you really?  Oh.  And powder up a little bit.  Powder up.  Oh, I can certainly stroke that really good for you.  Who was that?  Thank you, Kelly.  Who was that chick that was on her old show with that powder?  Jeremy?  What's the name?  She came in with the gold bond, I guess.  Right.  But there was a new one in a blue bottle, and she suggested that this is, you know, after  you shower to powder up your balls with the blue stuff. 
[01:00:30]  Wasn't it mentholated?  Holy S.  Yeah.  It was mentholated.  Burns like no one's business.  Really burned.  It was her little joke.  Especially right after a shower.  No, then the guy started calling.  Oh, no, dude.  I'd do that for a nice little tingle after a shower.  Good luck.  Put some Bengay on it.  Let's say hi to Brian in North Carolina.  Brian?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  A little piece of advice.  You kind of stepped on my toes there, Opie.  What you want to do is just get some of the regular baby powder after you dry yourself 
[01:01:00]  off, you know, after you shower.  You could use the baby as an applicator.  Just put a little bit on there, but, you know, the only issue there is if you use too much  and you start sweating, you end up looking like you got, like, jizz flakes down there.  So just use sparingly.  Yeah, I don't have, like, a particularly sweaty, awful crotch.  I'm not going to powder it.  I just want to know what to put over it because there's nothing under it.  Like, I have no hair under my balls, so it's not there that I need to worry about.  It's above the pubic region where I really don't sweat anyway.  I mean, above the mule in the pubic region, so it's like, it's not a sweat issue for me. 
[01:01:30]  Well, no matter what you do, it's going to itch on some level, so you've got to do something.  That would be the best way.  It worked for me.  Until you get used to it, eventually it goes away, right, the itch?  Exactly, exactly.  For the first week, you might need that, and then, you know, you can take the training  mules off.  All right.  Thank you.  Brandon's saying, Brandon's saying, don't shave it all the way.  It'll itch too much.  Someone is saying, use a beard trimmer.  A beard trimmer?  No.  Scott from Indiana, he wants you to use women's shaving foam. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Scott.  Hey, Bonzo Tits.  Use, yeah, women's shaving foam, because it's kind of like conditioner.  It sticks around longer, and I can't believe the lady didn't recommend that, but I use it  to shave with, because you know how you kind of like shave over the same spot twice, it's  still, you can still feel it there.  Okay.  Anthony, are you amazed at this?  No, no, I could see.  There's some shaving going on out there.  There's a lot of shaving going on.  A lot of shaving going on. 
[01:02:30]  Occasionally, if it's unkempt, you'll take the scissors and, you know, do a little trim,  like trim the hedges, but you never take it down to the lawn.  You know, you don't just eliminate them completely, like Jimmy did.  I want a gravel driveway.  You just want nothing.  Nothing.  I don't know.  I want to try it.  See if I like it.  You've got to kind of take the scissor, and if you've got like the bozo head or the Larry  Fine happening, you know.  Hey, I'm warning you.  Trim my hair, Moe. 
[01:03:00]  You've got to like kind of just clip the sides.  But other than that, no, there's no razors involved.  Nothing like that.  All right.  And someone is suggesting.  Then you've got to hide the huge clumps of hair.  Well, you live alone.  You don't have guests, do you?  I don't do it on a dining room table.  Well, what do you do?  You flush down the toilet, or you put it in the garbage?  I stand over the bowl.  Holy.  Over the bowl?  I'm just wondering what you do with it.  No, I think you're going right down that Howard Hughes road again. 
[01:03:30]  You have to hide your pubic hair.  Hide your hairs.  Did anyone else hear that?  Behind your jars of urine.  I'm like, hide.  I trim right over the bowl.  Yeah.  I'm done.  I didn't know what you were trimming.  You're hiding your pubic hair after you trim up.  Where's your mirror over the toilet?  You look down.  You have a mirror over the toilet?  You said you trimmed it in front of a mirror.  I don't need a mirror.  What is a mirror?  To do your sack?  No, you lift it up.  I don't do the sack.  You said you shaved your sack.  No, I said I don't need to shave my sack.  You don't listen on this program.  It's not like people are going to be like, oh, nice haircut.  I mean, as long as it's close enough, you're just like looking down, clip, clip, clip, clip, 
[01:04:00]  right into the bowl.  That's exactly what I do right over the toilet.  That's what you do.  I thought you were going in front of a mirror.  You're styling?  You've got to style it.  Jesus.  Anthony's got a comb.  I give mine the George Clooney.  It's got a footstool, so his pubic hair is showing the mirror.  A couple of years ago, I was cutting it into the Rachel.  Well, if I don't dry it, it just gets oh so curly.  Right.  I have to dry it.  It curls up.  You've got to blow dry it.  No, I have a big mirror in front of my bathroom.  I was doing it. 
[01:04:30]  I do do it in front of the mirror, which happens to be over my toilet and my sink.  Oh, okay.  I got you.  But I straddle the bowl right in the thing.  Flush.  But then it goes.  Hide it.  Well, I was thinking if you were throwing it into your waste paper basket.  Jesus, how much hair do you got down there?  I've got a couple little clippings that fall into the toilet.  Any time there's any errant hairs lingering around your bathroom, you kind of look at it  and wonder where it came from.  What do you think I do?  Straddle my white couch and just trim it right there and leave it by a pillow?  I think I'm in a little deep here, deeper than I intended on knowing. 
[01:05:00]  Well, I think so, too.  I'm just saying that if there's this clump of hair that isn't just normal, everyday  hair that ends up on the sink or the floor or something, you would wonder where it came  from.  Are you working for a toupee company on the side where you have to hide until they come  by?  Maury's pubes don't fall out.  Fuck him, that cigarette hijacking Mick.  What am I, a schmuck on wheels?  I want my money, Henry.  He's hiding his pubic hair now, Jimmy. 
[01:05:30]  No, if you cut off a clump, if you're cutting off the sides, like I said, the Larry Fine,  you would take it, and if you decide to throw it away in the waste paper basket, you'll have  to roll it up in like a little bit of toilet paper first and throw it, if you're not flushing  it.  Oh, no, you don't.  I'm writing it right in the right in the garbage.  Because then you'd look and go like, I can't leave that there.  If a guest comes over and they sit on the bowl and take a little look into your garbage,  you've got to watch what you put in your bathroom garbage.  You're worried about your plumbing.  That's why you're not flushing it in the toilet. 
[01:06:00]  No, no, my plumbing's good.  I flush them wipes down there all the time.  That's all.  I'm just saying you don't want this clump of hair that doesn't look like you just maybe  clean the drain.  Okay, you clean the drain of your shower.  Maybe there's a little hair in there.  And you clean it out and you throw it into the garbage.  That is obviously the shower hair in the garbage.  If there's just this cut of pubes laying there, then any guest would be like, oh boy, look,  there's a big clump of pubes. 
[01:06:30]  Anthony, you don't have guests.  You are absolutely right.  So why are you worried?  No, occasionally people are over my house.  There are guests that come over sometimes.  Like, let's say Barry Shapiro's coming over to do some tax stuff.  That's not a guest.  And he's got to use the bathroom.  That's annoyance.  I don't want him looking and he knows enough about my financial state.  I don't want him to know about my pubes and that there's a big tuft of hair in the garbage.  How do you actually clean like that? 
[01:07:00]  You know that little shower drain?  Because when I first moved into my place, it was all conked up.  I actually just take it and suck whatever is on it off.  I did that like the first day I moved in, I just sucked the bottom of the shower drain.  That is really disgusting.  Sucked that hair and scraped my teeth against it until it's nice and clean.  My shower was backing up after about, I don't know, two years, three years of using it.  And I had to go in.  I went in, got a hanger.  Hanger.  Is it hanger or hanger, people? 
[01:07:30]  Hanger.  Hanger.  Is it like linger or singer?  Hanger.  It's hanger.  Hanger.  I took a hanger.  A hanger.  Just say tuition saver.  All right.  You unravel it, and I shoved it down the drain and started doing a Roto-Rooter thing.  Right.  And pulled up.  It was a Wookiee that came out of the drain. 
[01:08:00]  A wet Wookiee.  Just this mass of hair.  What a Drano.  Yeah.  It was beyond Drano.  Drano is amazing.  It was beyond Drano cutting through this.  It was such a lump of, and I was so disgusted, I couldn't look at it.  I had to do it by, like, almost by touch.  I had to wrap it up in toilet paper.  I didn't know you very well.  It was so utterly disgusting. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  Coming up on the program, we're going to talk about septic tanks.  Septic tanks.  We were almost there.  That's right.  We were right there at the toilet level.  And why their show should be broadcast from one.  Big Will, what's up?  Yeah.  I wanted to tell Jimmy I'm glad he took some time out to watch some different porn other  than tranny porn.  I've seen his review in Hustler's this week.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Yeah, we haven't gotten to your review in Hustler yet.  I hope you enjoyed it.  Yeah, it was awesome, man. 
[01:09:00]  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Oh, here it is.  Don't use blue gold bond.  Steven Austin, what's up?  Hey, you screwed up with the gold bond powder.  If you're using the blue bottle, that's foot powder.  And that hurts way worse because I used it by mistake one time.  That's no good.  You've got to use the light green bottle.  I used it because it was suggested by this lady on the old show.  And, man, does it burn.  Yeah.  All right.  Punch it out.  And that's all we've got on that.  All right.  Anyway, moving on to other things. 
[01:09:30]  Are we done with Jim and his pubes?  And yes, we are.  And Anthony and his OCD.  And I don't have OCD.  I am the furthest present from OCD.  My God.  Got some phobias, though.  Phobias?  Maybe a couple of phobias.  Some foibles.  I have my way of doing things.  Some little quirks.  I call it my way of doing things.  I call it Anthony's quirks and foibles.  No foibles.  I shave my foibles. 
[01:10:00]  Do you know what Donkey Sausage actually told me to do to take away any itch?  He said use some clear deodorant over it.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know if that works.  Maybe because...  Is she becoming your advisor?  No.  She's advising him on everything.  On a lot of stuff.  Who got the grout out of your wood floor?  Who?  Her.  Her.  And now she's giving you advice on your pube shaving.  That's right.  Any time, yeah, there's any type of maintenance to be done, she's very helpful.  She helps you with your decorating or anything? 
[01:10:30]  She also helped me photoshop the Ozzy picture that I got signed.  I had that photoshopped.  It was a glare from the XM sign that I had to take out.  Holy crap.  You got her involved with that?  Yeah, what?  Just brought back a memory from the last OzFest in Philly.  Oh, I thought that was bad today.  What?  I don't know.  Him and his celebrity photos?  Yeah.  You know, whoever's around has to take the picture.  And it's not bad enough that you're panicking like you're not going to get a good picture  of Jimmy and the celebrity.  Screw it up and you're done. 
[01:11:00]  I got a picture with him and I believe it was Rob Zombie, right?  Rob Zombie.  And I was proud and I'm like, ah, look, Jimmy, look at this picture.  You and Zombie could see each other's faces perfectly, you know?  Nice expressions on both your faces.  He's like, ah, goddammit.  I'm like, what?  Look at the glare in between us.  Oh, boy.  We were standing in front of the glass door and there was just a glare in between us.  It looked weird.  That was all.  It was just like in between the two faces, there's like this little white.  I wasn't mad at you.  I was just, you know, it was like, ah, it's not the glass.  You were just mad at the picture because it has to be perfect.  And I'm like, but no one's going to care. 
[01:11:30]  Ends up photoshopping the crap out of it to get rid of the glare.  Well, I did.  It looked perfect.  I just had Rob Zombie sign that picture last week in Philly.  See?  But the same thing happened where she was helping you get that out of the glare?  With the Aussie picture right out here.  Just it bounced off the thing.  But she did a perfect job with it, yeah.  And now my Tony Iommi photo, I am having photoshopped just because of the glare.  There was sun behind me and it was a tent in Philly.  Yep.  And it's so bright behind my head that a little bit of my head is kind of like washed.  Very little bit.  So I'm trying to have that just the levels. 
[01:12:00]  Just the brightness taken out of it, yeah.  But I don't change anything in the photoshopped.  Just remove glare.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jeremy, the trucker.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Wilson, I'm calling it out of concern.  If you guys don't perform some sort of intervention, Anthony's going to end up like Mr. Pratt at the end of Creepshow.  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  Bugs got your tongue?  That's good, Jeremy.  I am really like Mr. Pratt.  I hang out in my place, look out the window, and just complain about people. 
[01:12:30]  Look at them.  Bugs.  They're all bugs.  All right, Jeremy.  He had it knocked.  All the new technology.  Tasty water today.  Okay, Lance Armstrong, congratulations to you.  Blah, blah, blah.  Is he retiring?  Seven.  Yeah.  Eight, right?  He's done.  Won his seventh.  Wow.  Tour de France.  That must annoy them so much.  Oh, of course it does.  He's an American with one nut, smashing their faces. 
[01:13:00]  Just beat you.  Seven.  Seventh Tour de France.  That is amazing, though.  Is it?  I'm now retiring, finally.  Is it that nobody else can ride a bicycle?  Is that what it is?  This guy is that good.  You know...  Nobody even comes close to this guy.  He's like Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  Let me explain.  He's not a...  Before Tiger Woods...  Before Tiger Woods, golf was for just old fogies, basically.  Uh-huh.  And Tiger Woods made golf a very hip sport. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  Now everyone's playing golf all over the place.  Young and, you know, it's just got a hipness factor to it.  Right?  Uh-huh.  What I'm going to explain, the Lance Armstrong, everyone is riding bikes now.  It is insane.  Like, Central Park in the morning when I come...  You know, I take my skates to get to work.  Right.  Everyone is looking like Lance Armstrong in the morning at 5 a.m., bicycling their asses  off.  And it's because he's just made this just, you know, top of mind, just over-the-top popular.  Are they wearing yellow bicycling jerseys? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, they look like they're in the Tour de France.  It's not like they're just jumping on a bike to get a little exercise before work.  They dress up.  They got teams in the park at 5 a.m.  They got, like, they all had their biking uniforms with their head guy.  It's like you guys are just getting a little exercise.  The state-of-the-art bikes.  And not just a few, dude.  Central Park at 5 in the morning, 5.30 in the morning, what have you, is ridiculous  how many guys are trying to be the next Lance Armstrong.  And the women, actually, as well.  Remember everybody wearing the shark hat for golf? 
[01:14:30]  And everybody wore the little cowboy hat like the shark wore.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Australian guy.  What's his shark hat?  The Greg Norman hat?  Yeah, Greg Norman.  For a while, everybody was wearing that.  I was like, don't wear the shark hat.  That's when you know someone.  Like a cowboy hat kind of looking thing.  That's when you know someone is having, you know, an influence on the sport.  Yeah.  When all of a sudden, it just becomes the thing to do.  You know, I'm sure it's happening in your neighborhood.  Everyone is dressing up like Lance Armstrong.  Yeah.  It used to be, you know, I want to get a little exercise, throw on some sweats, 
[01:15:00]  and bike around for an hour or a half hour before work, whatever.  Now these guys are just ridiculous in the park.  Ridiculous.  And nobody else, none of these professional bicyclists can beat this guy.  All these years in a row.  Pretty amazing.  You can't beat this guy.  Pretty amazing.  It really is pretty amazing if you think about it.  It really is.  You'd think they'd come up with one guy that comes close.  Right.  He kicked ass.  Well, that's on the front page of Newsday.  Who's he fucking?  Cheryl Crow? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Is that it?  Yeah.  I like to bike when I'm in my gym.  That's the exercise I do.  You get on the bike?  A lot, yeah.  It doesn't hurt my foot.  Hey, before we talk about the time scare thing, we were talking about pubes and all that stuff.  Of course we were.  And, you know, I've got to be honest.  The show got a little gay in the last half hour or so.  A little gay.  You didn't.  This is the gay channel on XM.  It got a little gay.  Dude, I'm not saying anything gay.  I just wanted the guy to just like to hold my junk and shave it. 
[01:16:00]  A little gay.  You're right.  Just cup it gently.  A little gay.  So I want to, like, get the gayness out of the show here.  Wendy!  Hello?  Wendy on Long Island.  What's up, Wendy?  Hi.  Wendy!  How was your weekend, Wendy?  It was good.  How was yours?  It was great.  I was in Southampton all weekend long worrying about lawsuits.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Hey, Wendy, were you in Colorado, Wendy?  No.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Well, what would you like to do, Wendy? 
[01:16:30]  Wendy?  I wanted to play Guess What's in My Pants.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Okay.  And when do you think we should play Guess What's in My Pants?  Wendy!  Is this possible?  I'm home.  All right, Wendy.  Well, we need a little background info on the gal.  God, there are probably a ton of new listeners that have never heard Guess What's in My Pants.  Guess What's in My Pants.  We haven't played in so long.  Right.  All right, Wendy.  We're going to play Guess What's in My Pants with your fine young body.  How old are you?  21.  21 years old. 
[01:17:00]  You're driving to work?  Yeah.  Theme song.  Remember, no hints or clues as to what you have down there.  Well, that's the theme song.  This is the portion where we get to know the Guess What's in My Pants participants.  And this is going to be a little rough for her to do, driving?  Where are you?  I'm going to pull over.  Yeah, pull over.  LIE?  No, London, Northern State.  Somewhere secluded.  Oh, yeah.  That's a great road to pull over on.  Jesus.  What's wrong with you?  No, I'm going to get off.  It's the next exit.  Are you going to have a picnic like the Puerto Ricans like to do?  Saw that again this weekend.  What is up with the side of the Northern State Parkway? 
[01:17:30]  The Spicnic.  The Southern State Parkway.  Yeah.  And even the Long Island Expressway at times.  Yes.  Car breaks down.  Ah, while you wait for a tow truck, might as well have a picnic.  The coolers come out.  It's amazing.  The blankets.  The little hibachi.  They start cooking things.  It's called a Spicnic.  It's a very derogatory term for these things, but when you have Spanish people having a  picnic, you can't help but say it that way.  All right, Wendy.  Find a spot to pull over.  Okay.  What do you look like, first of all? 
[01:18:00]  I'm about 5'4".  I'm pretty muscular because I'm a gymnast.  Gymnast.  Gymnast.  That's not bad.  This shit again.  No!  No!  Shut up!  5'4".  Muscular?  Yeah.  Cool.  I have long brown hair.  I think.  I don't know.  Green eyes.  Pretty tan.  Nice.  Everyone's tan.  Oh, yeah.  That little Dominique Marciano, whatever her name is, gymnast, or the big fireplug type 
[01:18:30]  gymnast.  Mary Lou Rotten.  Like Mary Lou Rotten.  I'm a little like Dominique Marciano.  Ah, there you go.  Okay.  A little pixie.  Can I ask, not to be off color, may I ask your measurements?  Oh, okay.  My bra size is 32 feet.  My waist is like 25, 26.  And I don't know how big my hips are.  They're small.  I'm a pretty small friend.  You're a little petite.  Yeah.  But you got muscular legs?  Yeah, they're pretty muscular. 
[01:19:00]  You got one of those gymnast asses?  They're like very perky.  They stick out when they do the dismount.  Yeah, I got a good ass.  How much do you weigh?  About 115.  Perfect.  Okay.  All right.  She's all muscular.  Well, she scared us with a muscular comment.  You're fine, Wendy.  You're fine.  Okay.  All right.  Did you pull over?  Not yet.  All right.  As you pull over, Anthony's going to explain how we play Guess What's in My Pants.  Okay.  Here's how we play, people.  What Wendy is going to do is take her phone, and she's going to rub it on her most intimate 
[01:19:30]  of areas.  By the way, what exit are you on the Northern State Parkway?  I'd rather not say.  Damn it, because we've got a lot of people calling from Long Island right now.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  What she's going to do is rub the phone as we instruct her up and down, side to side,  and in a circular fashion, right over her most intimate of area.  And we must discern from the sound made over the phone what type of hairstyle she has. 
[01:20:00]  And those styles, they've changed over the years, but basically it's the big triangle,  the standard issue female triangle, which is also the 70s Earth Mama Moth.  It could be the pool rack full of Afro hair or kind of trimmed down, but just the triangle,  standard issue.  Then we have the Mohawk, or the landing strip as it's called. 
[01:20:30]  That's the strip of hair right up the middle.  Looks like a Mohawk.  Then we have what is called the Hitler mustache.  A lot of confusion as to what this is.  Hitler mustache is just a tuft of hair.  It probably started off as a Mohawk, but then you just shave it from the belly button down  toward the hole and leave a little Hitler mustache.  And then, of course, everybody's favorite, especially today, the wood floor, as we like to call it, 
[01:21:00]  also known as the JonBenet Ramsey and the Conor Peterson armpit.  Which, of course, is completely shaved.  All right.  Wendy, are you pulled over?  Just in two seconds, I'm pulling into the parking lot right now.  Oh, parking lot of where you work?  No.  Parking lot.  Which parking lot?  It's a gas station parking lot.  I'm not going to.  What town are you in?  Let's just say that. 
[01:21:30]  Do you really want me to tell you what town?  Yeah, what town?  Are your crazy people going to come get me?  No.  No.  No?  Do you want me to come get you?  No.  All right.  Okay.  What town are you in?  Right now, I guess it's Wilson Park or Roslyn.  Okay.  Roslyn.  Hey, what kind of car are you driving?  Just because...  No, it really matters when we're playing Guess What's in My Pants  because of the sound of the phone within the interior of the car.  It throws us off a little bit.  What?  I'm assuming you're probably driving, like, maybe a Honda or a Toyota. 
[01:22:00]  I think it's an Accord or something.  Yeah, that's what it sounds like, over the phone, anyway.  Okay.  Okay.  Are we close?  I'm just going to park because there's people in the lot that are over.  Oh, she's got to move.  Yeah.  Don't go where your phone craps out.  Yeah.  Someone is asking, because she's Wendy, can Woodfloor be the scatman crullers today?  The scatman with the shaved head.  I like that.  It's the is anybody home. 
[01:22:30]  Okay, I'm ready.  Hey, Wendy, can I ask what you're wearing?  Yeah, good point.  I'm wearing, like, just a regular green shirt and black pants.  Okay.  Pants.  What type of undershorts?  A dong.  Oh.  What does a girl like you do for a living?  Right now, I go to school, and I'm working in an office with a receptionist.  A receptionist, then she goes to school because she's only 21 years old.  Perfect.  Mm-hmm.  We don't have the theme song anymore?  Yeah, we do.  Oh.  Why don't we take this opportunity? 
[01:23:00]  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place the receiver  upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants?  My pants.  All right.  Wendy, are you all situated?  Yes.  Very good. 
[01:23:30]  Are your pants down?  Yes.  And your thong is down?  Yes.  You're just sitting there in the driver's seat of your car with your bare ass on the seat  and your snatch exposed.  Yeah.  Very good.  Let's just contemplate that a while.  Ah.  All right.  Let that sink in.  Wendy, if you would take the phone, please, and rub it in an up-and-down fashion. 
[01:24:00]  Okay.  You ready?  Yeah.  All right.  Do you hear it?  Yes, but we need a little more.  Just, you know, up and down like five times or so.  Okay.  Until you feel a tingle.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, there's some problems down there.  Telling.  That's telling.  I like that.  Okay, Wendy, we now need side to side about five times, 
[01:24:30]  and this is a very important one, so make it good.  What happened?  She.  Did she hit the hang-up thing on her phone?  Probably by accident.  With her lip?  Yeah.  Was it a, did she have a piercing that hit off?  I hope that was just a huge clit that got in the way.  Guys, that's sexy.  A big clit dialing 911. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, a huge clit.  The size of a thumb.  Yeah.  What happened?  A big hit off button.  A big cumbersome appendage on her that just needs to be loved.  Wendy, call back.  Bumping around, text messaging everyone she knows.  She's going to snatch hung up on us.  She can't wear panties.  Because it just looks like a mound of mashed potatoes in there.  Hey, how come your potatoes have a grape on the end of them?  No reason.  Wow.  We've never been in this situation before. 
[01:25:30]  We have never had a girl's vagina hang up on us, ever.  Maybe she got us.  No, she definitely didn't.  No, it looked like she was playing along, and then...  What the...  That was disgusting.  A dribbler.  Oh, what happened?  I was getting into that one.  You're kidding.  It was telling.  She'll call back.  What happened? 
[01:26:00]  You don't think she panicked on us, do you?  People are blaming Hawk.  No, no.  It says Hawk with big exclamations.  No, it's not Eric's fault.  Let's say hi to Tom in Delaware.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I just heard Stern playing that...  The mom yelling at her son that you guys played, like, what, last week sometime?  Man, he's just following us now.  What happened?  At this point, he's just following our program.  He used to be...  I know he has the XM and the Escalade, but it looks like he's doing a little show prep 
[01:26:30]  on the way home every day.  You know, you'd like to think that it is stuff that's available out there somewhere,  and you could probably get it.  And as, you know, people play things on the air, coincidence is going to happen,  and you're going to get things that are played on both shows, and that's fine.  It just happens.  But there has just been so many that the week after we play something, it ends up over there.  I don't know what's going on.  All the radio rips me off.  That's right.  Of course.  And I'm sure our listeners won't point it out to him that this audio was already played, right? 
[01:27:00]  Old hat.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  All right.  So, Tom, what do you have on?  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, Opie?  Hey.  You know, I used to think you were full of shit about that, you know, and I was going  to kind of get on you for it.  But, you know, listen, it's like you guys just played that last week.  You know, even if...  I mean, he's got to know.  And to do that, it's just...  I don't know.  It kind of sucks, you know?  How are they doing it?  All bleeped and stuff? 
[01:27:30]  No, you know, I just heard a little bit of it, and then I just turned over, so I really  don't know.  There's a lot of bad language.  I have the Wi-Fi, so I listen to you guys all the time in the truck.  But, like, when it's kind of portable, sometimes it loses a little bit.  So you've got to have the other antenna on it.  But, you know, I'm with you guys now, man.  Thank you, sir.  XM all the way.  I hope the listeners point it out to him.  I mean, he's good as well.  It's just embarrassing, you know?  Well, and then he goes on the air and...  All of the radio rips me up.  You know, and says that, and then we catch him, you know, almost on a weekly basis at 
[01:28:00]  this point.  We're finding all these nice little nuggets on the internet, and, you know, a week later  he plays them.  All right, well...  Thanks a lot, man.  Later.  Thank you.  We know he has the XM in his Escalade.  We know he listens.  There's no doubt in our mind, and there you go.  Find that clip.  Find that mother yelling.  That's obviously very important, Anthony, but first we've got to get back to Wendy on 
[01:28:30]  Long Island.  Wendy!  Wendy, what happened?  What happened there?  Your phone crapped out.  Crapped out?  Yeah.  Jimmy wants to know if your clit, like, hung up on us.  No.  No?  Did you accidentally press something?  I don't know, because I did it, and then I put the phone back to my ear, and I heard  nothing, so...  Does your clit hang over, like, Ziggy's nose in the cartoon?  No.  Over the fence?  All right.  Wendy?  Yes?  Can...  Are you in a... 
[01:29:00]  You can continue?  Yes.  I'm all flustered.  You can continue.  Very good.  All right, we were going with side-to-side.  Now, watch you don't hang up on us again.  Rub the phone side-to-side about five times or so.  Okay.  Very good.  This is so obvious, it's not even funny.  Yeah, I know.  Now, Wendy, if you would take the phone, rub it in a circular motion, around and around,  covering the entire area about five times. 
[01:29:30]  Hello?  Yeah, this is very, very easy.  Not for me.  Hey, can you do that one more time, Wendy, please?  Okay.  Got it?  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Yeah.  Anything else from Wendy?  No, no, I just...  We're ready with our guess?  Yeah.  Guesses?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, what do you say, O?  I'm going to say a wood floor, but with this stipulation, she shaved Friday. 
[01:30:00]  Interesting.  So, it's growing in a little bit.  It grew in a little bit.  All right.  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  I am also going to guess a wood floor, because I think she's a gymnast, and she's probably  very, very conscientious.  Very good.  And I don't think she shaved Friday.  I think she had a period, and she had diarrhea, so I think she did it Saturday afternoon.  Jesus, Jimmy? 
[01:30:30]  I will guess a wood floor, but I am going to say she shaved very recently.  This morning?  Could even be this morning.  Yeah.  If not last night, could even be this morning.  She's very proud of it.  Wants to show it off.  And being a gymnast, yeah, very clean and nice down there.  Anyone else?  No?  Hawk?  We're the only three that really matter.  All right. 
[01:31:00]  Wendy, if you would please let us know at this time.  Wendy, what is in your pants?  Wood floor just saved this morning.  Yeah!  Yes!  I kick ass!  I think you trumped us, even though we all said wood floor.  We all said wood floor.  Was I right, though, at least about the diarrhea?  No.  No.  No.  Yeah, that was the classic, let me tell you, the classic sound of a wood floor.  That was textbook. 
[01:31:30]  If you had to make a WAV file and store it in the Library of Congress and label it what a wood floor sounds like over a cell phone being rubbed on a girl's snatch, that would be the sound you use.  Textbook.  And don't forget, people, you can get your official Guess What's in My Pants t-shirt.  I actually had to hear that circular one again because I thought I heard like a little, like when it bumps over something.  You know something, there was not, the sound didn't change through all three procedures, through the circular, it didn't change at all, side to side, there was no change in the sound. 
[01:32:00]  Consistent, raspy sound means wood floor.  Wendy?  Yes?  Thanks for playing.  Guess What's in My Pants.  No problem.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants. 
[01:32:30]  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. life.  Yeah, I want to give a fuck you, you damn assholes.  Fuck you, you damn assholes.  Fuck you, you damn assholes.  To that voice that says, shut up, you damn assholes.  Fuck Howard Stern. 
[01:33:00]  He ain't shit.  He thinks he's shit, but he ain't shit.  You guys kill him.  Yeah, I might have sent a big old F to you to the airline security.  They kicked my grandma all off the airplane.  She just had her set of needles now.  Knitting needles.  And I was afraid she's going to knit a napkin.  I'd like to give a big F you to Anthony.  What kind of asshole picks on a retard like Big A for saying photographer when he can't even say finger? 
[01:33:30]  F you, Anthony.  Yeah, this is Ryan from Pauling.  I'm going to give a big F you to the goddamn car in front of me.  Bad enough, we're going 20 miles an hour.  Why does this guy have to be the guy who, despite whether we're going fast or slow,  has to give at least five fucking car lengths between me and the guy in front of me?  I'd like to leave a great big fuck you to that fucking cunt in a Mercedes that cut me off in Chicago yesterday. 
[01:34:00]  I want to give a big fuck you to Frenchie who didn't have the fucking balls of courage to crawl in on that steel day,  you faggot motherfucker.  Inpatient cocksucker.  Call the opiate Anthony F you line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Oh, fuck you very much.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was number one at the box office over the weekend. 
[01:34:30]  I saw that movie.  It was good.  You did?  Johnny Depp doing a great Jim Carrey impression throughout the whole movie.  Is that what it is? 
[01:35:00]  Really?  I think you're thinking Jim Carrey when you're looking at Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.  He's doing a Jim Carrey, what, like kind of the mask or Jim Carrey?  A little of everything, a little Ace Ventura.  Ace Ventura, yeah.  The mask, sure, a little of everything.  Really good movie, though.  Not a bad remake, even though I think that's why they changed the name of the movie.  They don't want people to think remake.  It's not a remake?  Kind of different storyline?  No, it's pretty much the same storyline.  Do the kids all go in, try out little things, and by one they get eliminated?  It is the same movie. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, okay.  You know, Tim Burton's twist, maybe, but it's the same movie.  But I was very suspicious when the movie came out.  They're not calling it Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  They're just calling it Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Because I think, you know, remakes in Hollywood, even Hollywood knows now that...  Well, the book was called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and then the original movie  they made, they changed it to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  But why wouldn't they just call this Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?  Because it was the book.  It's a movie about the book.  I don't know.  That seems to be what they were going for. 
[01:36:00]  I think...  The original name.  I think Hollywood doesn't want, you know, everyone thinking, uh-oh, remake.  Remake.  This is going to blow.  Even though it was a remake.  Even though it was a remake.  Then Wedding Crashers in second place.  Does this matter?  Does this matter?  Does it matter?  No.  They do it on TV and in the paper, so I figured maybe we should do this.  The top five movies of the weekend, but...  Maybe if we saw them.  You saw the one.  You know what?  I bet you I could even just hide, and you could figure out what the top five are.  Obviously, it's the top five movies that are advertised the most on TV. 
[01:36:30]  That's all this is about.  That's what people go to.  It just makes me hate the public more.  The Penguin movie didn't make the top five.  Oh, I saw the stupid commercial for The Penguin all weekend long.  They're saying that movie's one of the best movies of the year.  You know, it's presented like a very family-friendly kid-type movie, where it's all cutesy, and they  show little penguins.  Isn't there a scene in there when they're getting ripped apart by lion seals?  Oh, yeah.  That'll be a little distressing to the children.  Anyway.  Mommy, why is the penguin's intestines all over? 
[01:37:00]  Anyway, Wedding Crashers in second place.  They ripped off his slippers.  Penguins just roll around like a bleeding oval.  A bloody bowling pin.  Steve.  What did I tell you?  I'm sorry, dude.  Everyone's in a while.  And this is when the penguin will roll around in the sky.  After the lion seal bites his feet off. 
[01:37:30]  Exactly.  That's extremely accurate.  The lion seal is tattooed and has little boy shorts on.  Boy shorts.  You do look like a big lion seal.  Thank you.  Anyway, Wedding Crashers.  Ramon, bite off my flippers.  Dude, they killed the seal.  We will get into that in a second. 
[01:38:00]  I did observe that whole thing going down.  Wedding Crashers, second place.  Yeah.  A lot of people saying go see Wedding Crashers.  People say it's funny.  Haven't seen it yet.  It is.  Very funny.  Fantastic Four in third place.  Anyone see Fantastic Four yet?  Good?  It's a comic book.  If you can just suspend disbelief.  No, it's not.  It's a movie.  Well, okay.  I apologize.  It's not Spider-Man.  It's not rooted in any kind of reality. 
[01:38:30]  It's very much a movie version of a comic book.  It's not Spider-Man.  It's not rooted in any type of reality like Spider-Man was.  Yeah, well, I mean, Spider-Man.  What are you talking about, Steve?  Steve, let me turn in.  No, Spider-Man is real.  Jesus Christ.  He was bitten by a radioactive spider, and he shoots webbing.  Steve, let me turn down your mic.  You're at a minus two PGM right now.  I got to lower you.  Minus two PGM?  Oh, my Lord.  Just got to lower you a little bit.  Sorry.  You and your booming production voice. 
[01:39:00]  Radio voice.  Radio voice.  Radio voice.  Radio voice.  Radio voice.  Radio voice.  Radio voice.  Radio voice.  Radio voice.  Anyway, so, thumbs up or down with the Fantastic Four?  It was fun.  It was fun.  I mean, you know, it wasn't.  I honestly, thumbs down if you're looking for something like a Batman or a Spider-Man.  It's not rooted in reality like Jurassic Park.  I meant, in the, in the, I'm not going to dig myself out of this.  Why?  All right.  In the sense that, like,  Well, what are you fucking talking, sweetheart?  You could actually think that. 
[01:39:30]  Shut up!  I'm not talking anymore.  Oh, Steve.  I know, I know.  Stop.  You know, we joke a little bit, and then now we need the real answer.  So, of course, I understand that.  So, in the sense that Spider-Man would actually, you would actually think that there were actual  places and real, real places within New York City that Spider-Man could actually go to.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up.  Because there's the city. 
[01:40:00]  It's New York City.  Right.  It's New York City.  But, Fantastic Four, I don't think, was rooted in New York.  I think there was some actual fictional city, you know, one of those metropolis kind  of things.  What?  Phillips is funny?  No shit.  I stepped on the cliff, got out of my thumb.  Well, that's actually realistic, because you look at Danny, and you can picture him painting  himself green, and just flying around throwing grenades.  You are so mean to Danny.  I love Danny.  You're mean to him, though.  I do.  I love Danny.  Let's say hi to Dave in Connecticut.  You're mean to him, though.  Maybe we should take Danny to a barber. 
[01:40:30]  Go ahead, Dave.  Hey, guys.  I wanted to know what kind of animal a lion seal is.  Did you guys mean like a sea lion or a seal or something?  No, no, no.  It's a seal that roars.  We don't know.  Weren't they talking about that in the review for the Penguin movie?  No, but it's called a sea lion, not a lion seal, is what that caller is pointing out.  I think there's a...  I don't know.  Isn't there a sea lion and a lion seal?  Let me see.  I'll look. 
[01:41:00]  I like making...  Can you remove that faggoty ringer, please?  It's the Beverly Hills cop theme he has on his thing.  Bop, bop, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  It's awful.  Consider it removed, Jimmy.  How about something more masculine, like Eternal Flame with Robert Reed's voice in the background?  Ooh.  Nothing on that?  Yeah.  All right.  I guess...  If I was listening, maybe I would have gave you something.  Bopie.  Fantastic Four in third place.  You know what?  I hate to admit this.  What's the island about?  Exactly. 
[01:41:30]  It is a huge, huge budget Michael Bay movie.  I mean, a lot of buzz.  It was supposed to be really good.  It grossed $12 million.  It's an island full of clones, is what it is.  It's a movie about clones, Robin.  All on the radio rips me up.  Of course they do, Howard, as you play something we played last week.  What is it about, though?  It's about...  What's the synopsis?  It's a futuristic movie where rich people can pay for clones to be constructed so they  can harvest body parts when they get sick.  Right.  And these two clones...  It's not based in reality, like Lord of the Rings. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's entirely fiction.  Yeah, there's an island full of clones.  Yeah, there's an island full of clones that are used specifically to harvest body parts  so when rich people get sick, you know, you can replace, you know, a kidney or a lung.  And then the clones realize what they're being used for and, of course, there's some kind  of rebellion.  Tell them, Fred!  Hoo-hoo-hoo!  Clones, Robin.  That sounds good, actually.  An island full of clones.  It was supposed to be, and the buzz on it was that it was going to be good.  It sounds good, it looks good from the trailers I saw, the effects look really good. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  And, uh...  Wait, Scarlett Johansson's in the movie?  Yes, she is.  Oh, now I gotta go see the damn thing.  It's getting a 41% rating on RottenTomatoes.com.  That's a Rotten Tomato, isn't it?  That's a Rotten Tomato, Anthony, yes.  Not good.  Maybe we can get some of the, you know, funner reviews.  We like reading the ones that are silly.  All right, and then in fifth place, Bad News Bears.  Bad News Bears, that was the movie I wanted to go see. 
[01:43:00]  That was sold out, so I had to go with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Gee, you're just in a kid kind of mood, weren't you?  I wanted to see Bad News Bears, but that was sold out, so I went to Charlie and the Factory.  You know, sat next to a tot.  You know, hands wandered.  Bottom of the popcorn box.  It's kind of cut out.  Dude, and I gotta mention again, we all hate going to the, you know, the movies on the weekend.  Yes, we do.  And I broke my own rule, because I was like, well, let's go to a movie.  Which theater?  Down there on 110 there, way down. 
[01:43:30]  In Huntington?  Yeah, down past Adventureland and all that.  No, I did a little weekend on Long Island.  A little Long Island weekend.  Oh, you went to the big one by Republic Airport.  Yeah, massive.  Yep.  Where you go there, and it's just cattle.  Yeah, cattle.  Cattle, where you gotta go up and down, up and down, up and down, until you finally get to the ticket window.  20,000 theaters in there.  And I don't know why, man.  I'm sitting there, and my, I'm just, my skin's crawling. 
[01:44:00]  Well, you hate the cell phones and all that.  We've talked about it.  I hate, no, I hate everything in the movies.  I cannot stand listening to people eat popcorn.  It drives, dude, it drives me nuts to a point I can't even control my frustration with it.  Is it when you're sitting there before the whole movie thing starts, or the quiet parts of the movie?  Well, when you, when the previews are going, you know, in between previews, when it gets quiet for a second or two, whatever,  or, or they just have music before the voiceover, you can hear just a little. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  But when, when the feature's about to start and it's really quiet, holy, I almost have to leave the theater.  Termites.  It, I don't know what it is, but it drives me nuts to, to listen to people eat popcorn.  That is really annoying.  It's brutal.  And if you're in a theater that's completely filled, it's unbelievable, it's, it's like you said, it sounds like locusts.  Yeah.  And it's one of my things that I just cannot stand, dude, I cannot stand it on any level.  Like, I'm, I'm putting my fingers in my ears, like, oh my God, please, more noise in this theater to drown out the popcorn eating. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And then the, everyone ripping open their bags.  So I open my Twizzlers very quietly.  I'm so glad the movie industry, you know, figured out packaging that is nice and quiet.  Holy shit.  It's already annoying enough that you got to watch these movies with other animals, but now you got to listen to everyone opening up their, their little treats, you know, bags of goodness.  That's why I love a nice big screen TV, my own couch, and that's it.  When is the cable industry going to figure out that, you know, you throw these, uh, these new releases right on TV, right away. 
[01:45:30]  They will.  Even, like, make it like, uh, a $50 charge if you have to.  Ooh.  There's a market for that.  A little much.  Not really.  Maybe if you're going to have a bunch of people over and charge them.  But not really, yeah.  If all of a sudden you're like, you know, you get a bunch of people and say, hey, we're going to,  we're going to watch Bad News Bears in, in the comfort of my, you know, living room or down in my den with my great sound system.  Exactly.  But how do you regulate it then?  Yeah.  How do you regulate it?  How do you prevent people from inviting a hundred people over to live? 
[01:46:00]  Dude, there's a.  Bootlegging it.  There's a market.  Because then I'm sitting there, because I haven't been in the movies in a while.  And I'm sitting there looking at this screen like, this is so fucking archaic.  And I don't even have that great of a system at home.  But I'm looking at the screen going, are you kidding me?  Yeah, all grainy.  It's not.  The screen stinks.  It's got jujubees on it.  It's ripped.  You can tell the screen's dirty to begin with.  And of course, it's not digital.  It's awful.  And then you've got to listen to the people opening up their bags of goodness, the popcorn eating. 
[01:46:30]  It drove me nuts.  Just go to the movies in the afternoon.  When, you know, when nobody else.  It's still a stinking movie theater.  Yeah, but it's usually feet on a carpet.  It's cheap and it's usually empty if you go at like two o'clock in the afternoon, if you really want to see the movie.  And then Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ends.  It was a good movie.  And people start applauding.  They're clapping.  What?  I hate that.  Who, what?  Who are you?  Who?  They're going to bow.  What the?  Who?  Who's listening to your applauding?  Clapping. 
[01:47:00]  Get out of the seat.  I want to leave.  Almost like Tim Burton's going to walk from behind the screen and go, oh, thank you.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Applauding.  Sometimes you go to things during the day, there's less people.  But then again, if you can't get a date because you're a loser, you have to go with Steve.  Oh, you went to see that play.  With my fucking fiancee.  How was that, by the way?  It was very good.  The movie was much better.  I'm not knocking the play.  It was very good.  It was very good.  How do you, now I know this is your first Broadway play. 
[01:47:30]  How do you like the whole Broadway live show experience?  I don't know.  I mean.  Not into it?  Not as much.  I mean, it was cool seeing Alan Alda in person.  Even cooler watching him duck into his car and meet nobody.  But whatever.  That's what he does.  Jeffrey Tambor I got a picture with.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You got a picture with him?  Yeah.  You didn't use it?  You got Tambor.  You got Tom Wopat, too.  Tom Wopat and Gordon Clamp from NYPD Blue.  Is that?  Oh, my God.  I didn't even realize that was him.  Yeah.  He's taking pictures.  See, that's Jimmy.  He takes pictures with people and realizes who they are later. 
[01:48:00]  I'll just take a photo with everyone on Earth and sort out the celebrities.  No, I just got him because he was in the play.  I loved him.  I didn't realize it was Gordon Clamp.  What a dope I am.  Okay.  Yes.  I just didn't make the connection that you said that.  Thank you.  But it was good.  Yeah.  But not like a movie.  Dude, there was a woman in front of us.  She was so lonely and old.  And she was just talking to us.  And I swear to God, she looked like me.  Yeah.  She had like stringy cancer hair.  And she looked like me.  And she was talking.  And what did she ask if we have any something? 
[01:48:30]  She asked if we had any something.  This would help the story a lot.  Yes, it would.  I just remember her walking across the aisle and striking up a conversation with the elderly  woman who she thought was a movie star.  Oh, yeah.  She's like, are you an actress?  And the lady who's like just shitting her pants because she's so old.  He goes, no.  And she's like, just talks to her.  But then she asked us if we had something.  And Steve leaned over and goes, a syringe full of Windex?  He was implying that he wanted to murder her with it.  Right there in the theater.  But I wish I could remember her question. 
[01:49:00]  So, yeah.  It was kind of cool.  But, you know.  I love Alan Alda.  Good seats.  Really good seats.  Best seats in the house.  Yeah.  I want a picture with Alan Alda.  Would you go to another show?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Maybe a musical next time?  Absolutely not.  Musicals on Broadway are kind of cool.  Are they?  You know what it is?  Because it's so, the sound is so big.  Yeah.  It's so live.  And the singing is very, you know, very up front.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I wouldn't mind seeing Spamalox. 
[01:49:30]  You really should.  That's very funny.  Oh, yeah.  Excellent.  All right.  Well, we'll see if there's any guys available to go with me.  I can't get a chick to call me back.  What a zilch.  Getting back to the movies.  Did anyone see the Bad News Bears?  No.  Nothing.  No.  It's not a movie I would go to.  There are very few movies I actually go to the theater for.  Why are you saying it like that?  That's a movie.  Because somebody's goofing on me that I said theater.  You did say theater.  I don't say theater.  I say theater.  Theater.  Theater.  You sounded it out perfectly. 
[01:50:00]  It's Krista the Blind Girl from Long Island.  I remember you, Krista.  Yes.  You messed up the word theater.  We can just add that.  You said theater.  I know.  I heard it.  What do you say?  Theater.  Theater.  Theater.  You said theater.  It was probably just a fuck-up that I throw in there once.  I don't say it like theater.  Let's not point out every time Anthony.  Far.  Thur.  Yeah.  Thur.  I went to a movie, sir.  It's the Opie and Betty Davis show.  Great. 
[01:50:30]  Well, that's good.  I say theater wrong there, Krista.  Why don't you read me some of the paper?  Ah-ha.  Sonar.  Ah-ha.  Damn, I don't have the computer on.  Otherwise, I would have done it for you.  Yeah, you would have.  When was the last time you went to the movies?  It's been a while, actually.  What did I see?  You call it the Hearies?  Jesus.  Jesus.  Quit a rubber face in it, man.  Jesus, man.  It's just one lousy word.  Calm down.  No.  So, Hank goes right for the throat. 
[01:51:00]  So, how does it feel not being able to drive or see a loved one?  All right.  Well, thanks for the call.  What's that, Ant?  Let's see.  The last movie I saw was Are We There Yet?  It was bad.  Let me ask you.  Were you really upset when you started to fall in love with Sidney Poitier and Shelley Winters  was kind of cock-blocking the whole thing?  I mean, I'm just saying.  Selina.  What?  Yeah.  Do you still have that sculpture you made for Lionel Richie?  Anyone?  That was a good one.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  You win no pop culture, Jim.  You go to the movies, though?  I don't watch Lionel Richie before that.  I don't watch other than I remember when I had my eye-pulls.  I love how she said, let me see the last movie I saw.  Yeah.  That's very interesting.  You do go to the movies?  Sure.  And you just, obviously, you just listen.  Exactly.  Oh, that must not be annoying to sit behind.  What's happening now?  What are they doing?  Are they driving?  Are they walking?  What is he wearing?  What's your hair look like?  Yeah.  What about those moments where it's not, there's not any dialogue, and things are happening?  Sometimes somebody will whisper to me if it's very visual. 
[01:52:00]  A lot of the times, you can tell what's going on, depending on the movie, by maybe they'll  describe it afterwards.  Like, there have been movies I've seen where a whole part of the movie, like, say it's  one of those heist movies, and they go in for the heist, the whole heist, there's not  a word being spoken.  They're using hand signals, they're breaking into a safe, they're doing things and being  real client.  Well, obviously, that's not a movie that I'm going to be able to go and see in a movie theater.  Guys, smartass. 
[01:52:30]  You know I have a talent for smelling bits, right?  Yes, you do.  You sniff them out.  I smell bit.  Can we do movie reviews with Krista the Blind Girl from Long Island?  Oh, that's a good idea.  How effing cool would that be?  Blind Girl movie review.  We love it.  Can you, uh, do you go to the movies regularly or not, or just every once in a while?  What's the deal with that, Krista?  Uh, every once in a while, I could be missed video and review video records.  She could review the new DVDs that are out, perhaps.  We really need to do something. 
[01:53:00]  Movie reviews with Krista the Blind Girl.  And you can't cheat.  You just got to kind of, you know, watch it like you normally would.  Like, is your favorite movie to go to the theater and see 2001, A Space Odyssey?  What was your favorite?  I don't want to read the book.  What was your favorite movie?  My favorite movie?  I don't know.  That's a hard one.  Um, I like, uh, Star Trek, The Wrath of Khan.  That was good.  Oh!  Now she's not all that bad in my book.  But, now explain.  You've been blind your whole life, right?  Right. 
[01:53:30]  Holy crap.  She tasks me.  So, why is that your favorite movie?  Um, well, they had a, it was, uh, good plot twists, I thought.  Um, I love Star Trek.  Uh, let's see.  What other movies do I like?  Why don't you get those LeVar Burton goggles?  Uh, let's see.  The Day After Tomorrow was very good.  Is there any chance for you to ever see or no?  It's got a little cheesy in some parts.  Wait, which movie?  The Day After Tomorrow.  Yeah, did you like the special of, yeah, yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Sorry, I got caught up in it.  A lot of CGI in that movie.  Alright.  Oh, yeah, I'm going to see Common Gateway Interface or whatever the hell it's called.  Would you see a, uh, current movie for us and review it?  Uh, let's see.  What's out now?  Wedding Crashers.  Wedding Crashers would be good or, uh, or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Ugh.  Nice. 
[01:54:30]  Not even a blind girl's going, ugh.  Someone's saying that her review would be a wonderful score.  Right.  All soundtrack reviews.  The flute got a little loud during the love scene.  And I felt the footsteps were sloppy.  I'll have to run away with it.  Just to interrupt for one second, when did I start to hate Whoopi Goldberg?  She's on with Regis right now.  Or when did I stop liking her?  I liked her in the 80s.  She's horrid now.  She's a good comic, I thought.  And I just don't know when I stopped liking her. 
[01:55:00]  And when did Regis start getting, uh, Ronald Reagan hair?  He's awful.  Yes.  Jesus.  He's got that dog shit hair.  Uh, people are saying that she shouldn't be sent to go see any Mr. Bean movies.  Is it true that blind girls should, God, our listeners are just as bad as we are.  Blind girls should review Afterlife, 60 minutes of no dialogue.  Really?  Yeah.  Or like Cast Away or something. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, Cast Away.  Cast Away would not be smart, right?  All right, I think there's something there, right?  I agree.  Any decent DVDs out now that I could maybe rent?  I don't like the fact that you're trying to get out and go into the theater.  Well, that's because I just don't feel like paying tons of money to go see a movie that  I might not even, unless there's something really, really good out that...  Well, Ben will reimburse you.  Ben Sparks will reimburse you.  Yeah, we got like a little slush fund. 
[01:56:00]  We do.  We will pay for your movie.  Really?  And we'll even throw in some free popcorn.  That's right.  We'll mail you a crispy fiver as soon as your review is done.  All right, Krista.  Interesting.  Thank you so much.  I'll have to find a movie to go and see.  Hold on the line.  We want to get your phone number, okay?  My phone number?  Yeah.  Yeah, no, we really want to try to get you to, you know, review a movie or two.  As long as you don't put my phone number on the net. 
[01:56:30]  No, no, we're not going to do that.  No, we would never do that to you.  That would be a, you know, a breach of privacy and all that.  Of course it would.  Take it easy, Cochran.  We're not going to put your number on the net.  We don't do that.  Jesus, who are you, Jim Phillips or relax?  We can spell torch.  I spent the whole weekend panicking that there was going to be a Sunday court session.  Mr. Norton, did you imply that this man, that's right, is not funny?  Yes, sir, I did.  Well, good day to you, sir.  It's time to go to jail for telling the truth.  Cocksucker, and I'll have to be had in four hours. 
[01:57:00]  You and that whole talking about septic tanks, I hope you die in a bus explosion.  That's right, I said it.  Wow, you're outrageous.  I know, I'm wacky.  You're a little edgy, Jim.  I don't mean to be.  You better calm down.  Easy, Jim.  All right, Krista, hold on a line.  Okay.  You're a friend of the show.  We would never do anything like that to you, okay?  Okay.  You've got enough problems.  Hold on.  There goes Krista, the blind girl.  Did you have to throw in?  You've got enough problems.  I don't know.  She's having a fine life now.  Can't you just be a gentleman?  Rathacon fan. 
[01:57:30]  By the way, Jimmy, you calm?  Yeah, I was really hot.  During the break, you broke your computer or something.  That's why Steve is in the studio, because he witnessed this thing.  I broke the mouse.  Shortest fuse ever.  I've never seen somebody get that pissed off that quickly.  First of all, there's junk on my desk that isn't mine.  I know it's a desk.  You've got to put stuff on it.  But all this shit that winds up on it.  And I know other guys have got to use the computer.  Dude, we've got a list not yours.  You're claiming this stuff isn't yours.  We've got a list of the stuff on Jim's desk.  Okay.  Where's Ben?  Because, you know, Ben, obviously, is a segermaker down here. 
[01:58:00]  He's right now highlighting things, then just scrolling through the page for no reason.  I love that Norton pointed out that Ben just laughs when you're pissed off.  Because I watched it go down.  You come in here raging about the computer.  I guess someone signed on and just messed it up so you can log on or whatever.  And you're trying to explain this to Ben, and Ben's reaction is just to laugh openly at you.  That was so funny.  My anger came from the fact, of course, I expect guys to use a computer.  I don't own it.  But when you do, it's like, just put my username back. 
[01:58:30]  Because it's like Jay Norton.  I don't remember if it's Jim Norton, Jay Norton.  And I've got, like, a minute to go back there.  I don't feel like fucking around and going through all the names of what my username is.  I remember my password.  Just click and have it come up.  The last person that used the computer, I think, was Opie on Friday.  No, I didn't get on, though, I don't think.  No, you didn't get on the computer on Friday?  No, because we couldn't figure out his log on.  And also, I just had problems, whatever, because my laptop is fucked up.  And I'm just cranky with the whole technology thing.  I hate it, dude.  I hate it.  But you spiked the mouse into the desk.  I don't care.  Good.  Good.  So he's trying to log in and then just takes the mouse. 
[01:59:00]  It's one of those wireless ones?  Yeah, it's one of those battery pack ones.  Yeah, which are really heavy because the batteries are in there.  And then just smash it on the desk to me.  Dude, you don't know how close I've come to putting my fist at home through my laptop screen.  I don't do it.  Yeah.  Or through my desktop screen.  I almost...  Hold on.  Let me explain to Steve.  I've never heard of vibrate Carlisi.  Sorry.  Jesus.  What's the matter?  Wasn't there a gay song you could put on?  Nice ring.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it was the Beverly Hills Cop theme. 
[01:59:30]  I changed it.  Okay.  The 1936 Bell Telephone Ring.  Jesus.  I'm being handed a note that Danny has Take On Me as his ringtone.  Yeah, it's awful.  Holy crap.  Well, Eric just sold him down the river.  What do you have on yours, Eric?  Yeah, Eric's is pretty bad.  Yeah, Eric's is pretty bad.  He wants to sell Danny down the river.  What is Eric's?  That same one that you heard last time.  Let me dial it.  What was it?  Hold on.  I'm going to call up Hawk.  Hawk, get your phone by the microphone.  Nope, I changed it. 
[02:00:00]  You're right.  I want to hear it anyway.  I'm sure it's awful.  It probably is.  That's my mic technique.  I've been working on that.  Very good.  Excellent.  It's been Eric's 718.  Okay.  Here we go.  Oh, there's the sound.  Yep.  Put it up by the mic.  Nothing?  It's ringing.  Oh, it's vibrating.  Called the wrong one.  Which one is that?  That's my personal phone. 
[02:00:30]  Well, of course your personal phone.  That's nothing.  You made us do this bit knowing you have a boring ring.  Holy crap.  And you have it on a vibrate?  No, that's just the regular ring.  But what's the other phone you have?  That's the work phone.  Oh, I didn't know the work phone.  And is that the one with the faggy?  Not that anybody could hear any of this because Eric didn't talk on the mic.  Yeah, Eric, no one can hear you.  Jesus.  Why would you let him call your number?  Hey, Karnak.  The job, E-Rock.  Karnak, why don't you just do this?  Just think it and people will know.  Jesus.  He just kind of whispers. 
[02:01:00]  Eric, mouth out the number.  I didn't even have that one.  He might have assumed I had that one.  You do realize when you do radio, you're looking for a payoff, right?  Oh, my God.  Just wait.  He's answering it.  There we go.  There, I'll give him the number.  What?  Oh, so we can waste another two minutes on this?  Eric, this was a quick throwaway.  Eric, mouth it to me. 
[02:01:30]  Holy shit, you're kidding me.  Was that the bad 90s dance song?  When you answered, did it say, hello, this is Tommy Morrison's blood calling?  What the hell is that?  I don't even know the song.  You don't have to.  Thank God you don't.  What is it?  It's a Euro dance song.  Why is that your ringtone?  So it wakes me up in the morning.  You had to make a conscious decision to put that in as your ringtone.  You know what wakes me up in the morning?  I got a Bose radio and fucking Blizzard of Oz is in there.  And I don't know Starks. 
[02:02:00]  And you jump out of bed when that shit fucking crying.  Right.  That's a great visual.  You want to wake up fucking Ozzy Osbourne is the first thing I hear.  And it never even gets to the lyrics.  So Jimmy destroyed his mouse is what we're getting at.  And then he tried to explain it to Ben.  And Ben just started laughing uncontrollably.  It's funny.  Hackling.  Because I wouldn't, you know, there's nothing.  Jim is always in a bad mood.  You're never happy.  That's not true.  You're never happy.  That's not true.  The majority of the time you're not happy.  Your moods shift very quickly, though.  This morning you came in, first thing you didn't even, you came in with your sunglasses on. 
[02:02:30]  There was something wrong with your orange.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you why.  I don't like to waste food.  I told Eric last week, and maybe I'll tell the interns, I don't want the oranges anymore  because for some reason the oranges have been awful.  So I'm not eating them.  So I told him last week, like, no oranges.  I wasn't mad about that.  I just didn't want to waste food.  Right.  The reason I was in a bad mood is because my laptop, another Dell product, I've had every  Dell product I've ever owned, I've had a problem with.  Uh, my laptop screen is now pitch black, and there's a teeny thin blue line at the bottom, 
[02:03:00]  almost like, and you can see where the icons are in the bottom, like the toolbar.  The toolbar.  I feel like a shade, a black shade has been pulled down over my entire screen, except for  the bottom sliver.  A little sliver of your, uh, toolbar.  That's why I don't know if it's the LCD.  Steve said it might be the LCD.  Yeah, it could be.  But I don't know if it is.  I feel like I'm hitting a button or something.  I don't know what this is, but it's very...  Could very well be the monitor, my friend.  So there you go.  Oh, about a $3,500 laptop, which I've had for a couple of years, 60 gigs, and, um, another 
[02:03:30]  Dell product that I've had a problem with.  People told me, do not get a Dell laptop.  Do not do it.  It's going to get fucked up.  Well, you know something?  Just call customer service, and I'm sure they will get right on it.  Oh, I'm sure they will.  Well, I'm sure that they'll have some very marvelous, uh...  Yes, Mr. Norton.  There is a problem with your monitor.  We've got...  Yeah, and you'll go through that for months and months and months.  If this screen is fucked, and it's going to cost me a grand or something for a new screen, 
[02:04:00]  I am going to throw it out my 10th floor window.  I am going to throw it out the window.  That'll show them, Jimmy.  That'll show them.  Slightly irrational.  You'll probably hit a child who will...  Their parents will sue you.  They won't know whose it is.  There's no...  You can't fucking pull up the screen.  Some guy with a black monitor threw this at my son and hit him.  So, we have a list of stuff that was on your desk.  Where did Ben go and Steve?  I don't know.  They were the ones that made this list. 
[02:04:30]  I guess they were trying to clean up your desk, and you didn't want them to or something?  Who said I didn't want them?  No, I don't know.  I'm asking.  No, no.  I'm asking where this came from.  No, because we're trying to keep the office nice and clean or whatever.  Ben is very sloppy.  He's the worst.  Ben is...  He's always been like that.  He's not going to change.  Ben's little section is just a mess.  It's amazing the pile of stuff he has in front of him.  I know where everything is, though.  No, I know.  We did this at the last reaction.  I know.  We gave up trying to get you to be neat.  To quote Joe Clark, Ben is a slovenly, sloppy boy. 
[02:05:00]  We were cleaning up the office the other day, and we're throwing stuff out,  and we were just looking at Jim's desk, and we were like, what the hell is all this stuff?  So then we decided, let's make a list, because there's so much crap on the other desk.  Dude, I hate it.  Just crap that shouldn't even be there.  Not necessarily funny, just stuff that shouldn't be there.  I don't know, but some of that stuff you've gotten for weeks, and you've just left it there.  But I put it to the side.  I don't pile it up.  So here's a list of stuff on Jim's desk. 
[02:05:30]  A Pat Battle picture.  Yeah, a big picture of Pat Battle is actually on.  We're not even talking about the show here.  We're talking about Jimmy's real desk that he uses after and before the show.  A picture of Pat Battle.  I was signing those, by the way, in Cleveland.  People were bringing that Pat Battle picture, and they want it signed.  It's fucking taken over, folks.  All right, an Aussie article from two months ago.  Oh, yeah, I didn't read that yet.  Haven't gotten to that yet?  A Sabra...  File that.  A Sabra Cadabra, I guess, some merchandise from them. 
[02:06:00]  A Black Sabbath CD.  A package from Dell.  What's in there?  I don't know.  Where is it?  Someone go get it.  There's been a package from Dell in there for weeks.  Let's hope it's a laptop screen.  Maybe they sensed it coming.  Of course, a box of porn.  A pillow.  What's that about?  That's on the couch.  Yeah, but while it was on your desk, you moved it off, but that's been there for a while.  Skincare products from a fan?  Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.  Skincare products.  Somebody sent me some skincare products.  That's nice.  You could use that on your shaven mound. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Some Nexium?  Yeah, it's mine.  Here's your Dell box.  Oh, thanks.  That's yours.  I don't know what it is.  Open that up.  It hasn't even been opened yet?  No, I'm bad with stuff like this.  Eight weeks ago.  A Fargo snow globe.  Yeah, but that's up in the thing.  That's not good.  Three Yankee DVDs, a talking fish.  Yeah, the talking fish.  Someone sent one of those talking bass, like a singing bass thing, and that found its way  onto Jimmy's desk.  Well, that was a bit we tried to get going that never really took off. 
[02:07:00]  Bad novelty items.  Yeah, we wanted people to start sending in their bad novelty items.  What is that, Jimmy?  So we could talk about them and, you know, put them up all over the studio.  It's a hard drive by Hitachi.  This has nothing to do with me.  This is shit.  Why is there a hard drive?  By Hitachi.  I don't know.  I guess maybe a listener sends it to you.  All right, I'll take it.  No, no, no.  It might be mine.  Oh, by the way, another technological problem.  I had a lot of stuff backed up on this Maxxer external, and, of course, that's not working  now.  I just, I fucking hate computers, man.  But, Dell, thank you, Dell. 
[02:07:30]  Now I have 60 gigs of shit, which is probably not gettable because of my screen just died,  apparently.  So if anybody knows a button I should hit.  That's the talking catfish.  Oh, that's loud.  Bass to the bone or?  Bass to the bone.  Well, that looks like a catfish.  Whatever it is, it's going from hand to the garbage can because I'm never looking at that  again.  That's horrendous.  I wanted big pussy's mouth, like, voice to come out of it when I talked. 
[02:08:00]  Right.  What's the matter?  You've never seen a talking fish before?  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Exactly.  Watch your eyes.  That's mine, Opie.  That's mine.  Watch your eyes.  That's mine.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy mackerel.  Drop something.  Let's see if it does.  Oh.  Ow. 
[02:08:30]  I don't want you performing some half-ass autopsy on a fish and having those batteries spill out  all over the floor.  Holy mackerel.  Holy mackerel.  Wham.  All right.  We're going to take a break with something that Matt from South Jersey sent in.  He did a little 0-8 thing.  He did.  With a little 50 cent in the background, I guess.  Nice.  Or is it 50 cent?  50.  50?  Just awful. 
[02:09:00]  Just dog shit.  Cringe radio.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM.  It's XM.  Satellite radio.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo.  I mean, I look around, I know I got my problems, and I look at all you guys and go, God damn  it, I'm not alone here.  This show is in trouble.  It's held together with, like, duct tape.  So I look over at Jimmy, and he's pointing over me.  So I follow his finger, and he's pointing right at Ben's mule.  Finger.  Something is missing in our brain.  Staring at Ben's hog.  What a collection of retards.  This is just dog shit. 
[02:09:30]  And then Jimmy goes, it's not me, it's Ben's mule.  Just awful.  Well, there was chicken, and I said, I'd like some chicken, and I pointed at the pepper  and said, I'd like some chicken, and a little of the Peterson boy.  Awful.  Just awful.  Just dog shit.  We are a collection of assholes.  Cringe radio.  All I know is the next time I hear Bruce Kelly talking, I want an Arab on each side of  him with a rifle pointed at his head.  Finger.  Finger.  Stop it.  Finger. 
[02:10:00]  And I'm just kind of sitting, hanging out.  Peter Jennings walked by.  He's walking real slow.  We make eye contact.  So I'm like, oh, man, I got to tell you something to Peter Jennings, you know?  So, you know, he's fighting this cancer.  The only thing I could think of, you know, on the spot was, good luck, bro.  Oh, my God.  You said, good luck, bro.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger. 
[02:10:30]  Finger.  Finger.  Awful.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Lee, I want you to be very honest.  Yes.  I'm going to put you on the spot here.  How annoying was Jim Norton, as far as the Robert Plant picture goes?  Don't hold back.  Because I guarantee you, I do have the respect to his tenacity in acquiring a photograph.  Tenacity.  It was unbelievable.  I've never seen anything like it.  Probably, well, it was back in the late 60s. 
[02:11:00]  Someone really, really wanted to meet Hendrix.  I think it was 67.  That's comparable, right?  That was comparable.  But since then, nothing like Jimmy trying to get the finger out of the plant.  It was absolutely unbelievable.  The vicious tenacity, the intensity.  That sounds better than just calling him a nudge.  I was a nudge, I'll admit that.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  But the photo is scary.  You've seen it.  Oh, it's horrible.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's classic.  I've got it on my trio right now. 
[02:11:30]  The little smiling faces.  His little lock over my face.  Yeah, the hair is touching your face.  The little men just smiling.  His head is as big as a pumpkin.  It really is awful.  I've never seen a bigger head in my life.  But you have to do it that way to get Robert Plant.  You have to do it that way.  He even said he's a tough one.  His people are very protective.  He's a very tough one to get.  You have to...  But Lee's a very important man, and he had a lot to do that day.  I would just pop in and ask him.  You didn't care about everything else he needed to take care of that day.  Now, I do want you to know.  Just went in there and said, look, I know we've got a performance here.  And this is a big deal. 
[02:12:00]  Robert's, you know, a rock god who got into this Norton thing.  Or the deal's off.  Or the deal is off.  We came so close to the whole show being scrubbed.  Yeah.  A very upset Robert Plant leaving his van, sulking, moving away.  Management and label freaking out because of Norton.  So at the last minute, Robert said, well, we've got to do it.  And he agreed.  And the picture was taken.  Yes.  And I understand Paul McCartney is stopping in at one point, possibly.  Well, you know, it's interesting.  We're talking to the McCartney people, and one of the conditions is a photo with you. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  It's an attorney.  You bet I'll be there for that one.  Okay.  You know, that's actually critical to any of you.  All the artists are coming to us now that we're big and popular and getting bigger all the time.  And it's interesting how the Norton factor is a key ingredient.  Now a negotiation, Floyd.  I hear Jimmy is demanding that they find a crosswalk to take the McCartney picture.  Is that true?  And you're making him take his shoes off.  I don't want to be a pain in the ass, but Paul, take your shoes off. 
[02:13:00]  Walk with me out to this crosswalk.  Wonderful.  As a matter of fact, I understand they might watch you on the cover of the next Plant Record.  Oh.  Be happy to be a part of that?  Nude crawling on rocks.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Don't want to be a monkey wrench. 
[02:13:30]  One more indecent accident.  I'd rather be there, suffer with it.  I'll never be your monkey wrench.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Thanks for checking us out.  And thank you for listening.  You, the faithful listener. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you.  You, the pest.  All right, we should get into some news, I guess.  We haven't talked about this incident in Times Square over the weekend.  Opie, it's Times Scare.  Oh, yeah.  Times Scare.  Ooh.  Yeah, a lot of security is.  By the way, what is Jimmy?  I don't know.  He ran off.  He's got things to do.  He's a busy, busy man.  I wish I could be like Jimmy.  Fall asleep during the show. 
[02:14:30]  Friday, he fell asleep during the show.  For 20 minutes, no problem.  He was asleep.  We're yapping.  I look over, and his feet are up on the console, and he was sound asleep.  Stupid me from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. every day.  This is the most important thing in my life.  Well, yeah.  And in your, well, you would think that's how it should be.  Yeah.  To Jimmy, it's one of the most important things.  Eh, I'm here.  But right now, he has some kind of problem with Dell, so he can't even, he can't even  think until he takes care of that problem. 
[02:15:00]  That laptop is his link to everything in his life, though.  It is his link to all the girls that want to have contact with him through his pornography.  Where were you, Jimmy?  His Craigslist, things like that.  His computer at home, that laptop, is your link to life, isn't it?  Well, I have a desktop, too.  You do?  Oh, yeah.  Well, then I'm talking out my asshole.  No, no, I have, I have, well, my desktop, the reason my laptop became so important is  because my Dell desktop had those electrical problems, which took me three months. 
[02:15:30]  Remember I was railing about that?  Yeah.  I didn't have a home computer for three months because of the nightmare of dealing with their  customer service, which was the worst I've ever dealt with with any company, and just  the complete lack of knowledge.  But they had me, I told you, they had me opening the computer, physically opening the back of  the computer, so it was an abomination.  And by the way, thank you to whoever sent me this MP3 player.  I appreciate that.  It's an MP3 player.  I think it is, yes.  So thank you very much whoever sent me that.  I appreciate it. 
[02:16:00]  I got my fans, by the way.  You know, the horror story that was these case fans from my computer, customer service  took months, and five or six, or I think maybe even seven different customer service  representatives, those Indians that they shove you off to with your phone call, it goes to  India.  Last we left you on this, you talked to Michael Dell's personal secretary.  I actually, yeah, got up to the top, and she said everything was going to be taken care 
[02:16:30]  of.  We are shipping these ASAP.  We are so sorry.  They shipped them out, ASAP, right to my address I lived at a year ago in Brooklyn.  Which was one of the problems you were explaining to her and everybody else that would listen  to you.  When I initially made the order, the Indian read back to me the order and said, and it'll  be shipped to, and then had my old Brooklyn address.  And I went, no.  I have a new address.  Okay, let me have it.  I'll put it in the system.  Okay, did that. 
[02:17:00]  The next four or five times I called customer service, every time they never had the right  address.  And I told them, God damn it, my new address, here it is.  Well, she shipped them out ASAP right to my old address in Brooklyn.  So Hawk, in a very nice gesture, went to the building and picked them up and brought them  in today.  So finally, here they are, and they look to be the correct fans from Dell two months later.  He went by your old building?  Yes, he did.  Actually drove by. 
[02:17:30]  You don't live far from there, right?  No, not at all.  Hawk's pretty close to there.  You dealt with the little maintenance guy?  The little Russian guy, yeah.  Trying to jump and clean the windows, but he's only four foot high.  He's like this little guy, we used to call him Gollum.  He's really awful.  But, I'm surprised they gave it to you.  No security, right?  Nope, nothing.  Yeah, not fantastic.  You could shop.  You could shop at those apartments in Brooklyn.  Just go there and say, yeah, that thing that came in today, I need that.  Oh, here you go. 
[02:18:00]  Shopping.  There you have it.  You all right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I was taken care of.  And you know what the problem with them is?  When you call in and you give information, or you have a case history, and it's like you  change something, or they go over something, and the guy promises you something, and then  you call back a week later, and they have no record of it at all.  It's like, you are a computer company.  How do you not log shit and have it, like when you pull up the name, James Norton?  And have everything that's happened, every transaction, every customer service call, 
[02:18:30]  everything that they promised you should be right there on the list.  I can't wait to see the abomination I'm going to have to deal with, and there's no way  I'm sending it out.  Absolutely not.  I don't have anything awful on there, but there may be a little footage of me receiving  oral treats from a young lady.  That's very possible that that could be on my laptop.  Not sneakily done, actually, handheld.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Please, I don't sneak anything.  I just hold it right at her dumb face.  Really?  Yeah.  But you've got to be careful. 
[02:19:00]  That's wonderful.  Yeah, it's the only time I ever was able to pull that one off.  And, of course, I had to save it for posterity on my laptop so you could watch it and whack  your bag when you're on the road.  Very nice, Jimmy.  Very good.  Good one.  Well, you wouldn't want that getting out.  Well, you know, a part of me actually would.  Is it?  My mule looks fantastic in it.  Does it?  Good angle?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it just looks good.  And she was so small.  You know, I picked a diminutive.  You need a small girl to make it look bigger?  Yeah, I picked a midget with her little fat fingers. 
[02:19:30]  Good job.  I'm trying to wrap around it.  I've had it for a long time.  It's actually old.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I just decided to put it on my lap.  Is your face on it at all?  Yeah.  Obviously, I wouldn't care.  Please.  A little bit.  All right.  Jimmy has a dirty movie.  I wouldn't say it's not long, but let's just say that there's one angle of the gal kind  of holding the camera, panning up.  Yeah.  And the fucker looks good.  What about a money shot?  Is there a pop shot?  But you can't see it.  Oh, really?  She was that good?  She was what you call a good girl. 
[02:20:00]  Here's the money shot.  Ah!  Boop!  So it's nothing that porn would ever want, but, you know, yeah, my face is definitely  in it.  And I have a shirt on, so you can't see my fat stomach.  Well, you definitely don't want that laptop then being fat down.  No, so now I have that problem.  What do you do?  You've got to have somebody come in there and fix it.  Someone said plug it into a regular monitor at home.  Get a cable.  Go from the back to a regular monitor, and then you could switch over by pressing, I believe, 
[02:20:30]  the F8 or something.  He's emailing you.  You suck this cock.  And then if it works on a regular monitor, it's obviously your monitor.  If on a regular monitor at home it comes up black, then you know it's something else.  I don't have a cable.  What kind of cable do I use?  I don't know, Jimmy.  All right, let's move on.  I get scared.  Let's move on.  Very sad day, by the way.  We'll do a little news here.  Why are you laughing?  What's so sad?  Sir Richard Dahl has died.  Sir Richard Dahl. 
[02:21:00]  Richard Dahl.  Everyone knows who he was, so we should move on.  But he died at the age of 92.  92.  Sir Richard Dahl.  Any guess?  Any guesses?  Is he from New York?  He's a British scientist.  I know.  He invents something huge?  Want to play three questions?  Something we use every day?  Something to do with...  All right, I'll give you three questions. 
[02:21:30]  Three questions?  Five questions.  I don't think you'll get it.  All right.  Did he invent something?  No.  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  Stop!  Don't go into the paper.  I'm looking at sports.  I'm looking at sports.  I wanted to look at...  You are a cheat.  All right, I'm going to look.  We can't have fun.  Every once in a while, we like to have a little radio fun.  All right, I'm going to look.  Here's a picture of him.  Sir Richard Dahl.  Oh, that guy.  He's an old guy.  92 years old. 
[02:22:00]  British scientist.  What is he known for?  Dying.  Four questions to go.  That wasn't a...  That's not a question, Ope.  I asked, is he an inventor?  Oh, we asked the question.  I thought Ope was going to ask questions.  No.  No.  Now you.  Okay.  No, Jim's not going to play long.  I certainly will.  All right.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Ask the question.  Don't panic.  He wasn't an inventor.  Don't panic. 
[02:22:30]  He's panicking.  He's panicking.  He's gulping.  Jesus.  It's a stupid game.  Where was he when JFK was shot?  Don't use that.  That's a question.  All right.  That's an awful question.  Is he a writer?  He's a scientist, though.  Damn it.  I knew that.  So I won't acknowledge that you asked the second question.  A scientist that didn't invent anything?  Did he discover something?  Ah!  Now you're onto something, my friend.  All right.  He's discovered something.  A British scientist that discovered something. 
[02:23:00]  That discovered something.  Was it a secret that got him killed?  No.  He discovered.  Is it something he discovered in space?  No.  All right.  Then it's on Earth.  That was my next question.  Damn it.  Now is it right down.  I already know who he is, anyway.  Oh, you do?  Of course.  No, he absolutely doesn't. 
[02:23:30]  He discovered something.  Is it something in the field of medicine?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes!  I think it personally affected Jimmy Norton.  I know exactly who it is.  There's a clue.  He discovered AIDS.  No, that doesn't have anything to do with me.  I got rid of that stuff.  It should.  No.  It will.  I'd be surprised.  A little Anacin.  Anacin.  That'd cure it right up. 
[02:24:00]  Hmm.  Done?  No.  I'm very curious, but I think I could get this.  Something in medicine he discovered.  It wasn't polio.  No.  It was a...  I already know who he is.  Another hint.  I think it was his cock.  He, um...  Medicine.  Some kind of organ thing?  I could give you a very obvious one.  Well, give him an obvious one.  He's smart.  He'll figure it out.  All right.  He discovered something that is harmful. 
[02:24:30]  Something harmful.  Oh!  He discovered bacteria.  The microbe?  Jesus, Anthony.  What?  You don't know who Richard Doll is?  No.  He discovered something that's very harmful to many, many people.  And, uh...  So harmful that, uh, Jimmy, uh, took notice one day.  What he discovered caused a lot of denials. 
[02:25:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What does that mean?  That was an excellent hint.  When are we going to turn on these cameras, by the way?  I've been asking for that for a long time.  I know.  If Don is listening, we want this studio camera, and that one, and that one, they're all over  the place, to be turned on.  Because, just to see your expression, as you said, the denial thing was priceless.  Denial.  Hmm.  Okay, he discovered something very harmful to people.  Very harmful to people, and Jimmy took notice. 
[02:25:30]  Jimmy took notice?  And it caused a lot of denials.  Denials?  Denials.  I don't even know what that means.  Oh, I, as soon as, as soon as it's revealed, what he did, everyone's going to go.  Mad cow disease?  No, you ready?  Yeah.  This was supposed to take 30 seconds.  Jesus.  Sir Richard Dahl, the British scientist who first established a link between smoking and  lung cancer, died yesterday.  He was 92 years young, as they like to say. 
[02:26:00]  During groundbreaking research in the early 50s?  50s.  Uh, he and colleagues interviewed some 700 lung cancer patients to establish a common  thread.  Ah.  That was the denials.  The tobacco company completely...  Right.  ...rebutted his, uh...  Oh, wow.  Very good, Jimmy.  It was, uh...  It was funny.  Yes.  Uh, Dahl said of the research, I gave up smoking two-thirds of the way through that study.  And I knew exactly who he was.  Um...  You did.  Richard Dahl's work has prevented millions of premature deaths in the 20th century. 
[02:26:30]  And will prevent tens of millions of premature deaths in the present century.  What a guy.  There you have it.  I actually read it in the post today, that's how I knew it was.  You did.  Yes.  Earlier.  You fibbed.  In other news, on the front page of the Daily News, Timescare.  Anthony, I was too busy worrying about lawsuits all weekend long, I didn't get to keep up  on the news, what's this story all about?  I had to look up all sorts of law terms in the law library.  Of course.  Like, tard. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, my weekend was so bad, Mr. Phillips.  Ooh.  Shaking.  You're right, the waves just weren't that good out east.  Yeah, were you talking like that, were you?  Phony, phony guy.  Thought the waves would be a little bigger.  Is that what you were worried about?  That's what I worried about.  Were you worried about a lawyer swimming out to you?  With a subpoena?  An injunction.  Don't play that unfunny audio again.  Yeah, there was a lot of worry in my weekend.  Yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Of course.  Faggot trying to use psychology.  What's the matter, boys?  Don't try to use psychology, you fucking blasted.  Well, I hope you guys and Logan have yourselves a nice weekend.  We did.  Yep.  We certainly did.  Thanks to my friends, Chris and Jay, I watched my 50-inch plasma.  Yeah.  That's what I did after I got back from Cleveland.  Nice.  I hung out with the guy that owns Elvis.  Really?  Yeah, actually I did.  Owns the Elvis fortune.  Yeah.  Who? 
[02:28:00]  I was hobnobbing out there in Southampton with my brother.  Who, who, who.  Now you are ripping him off.  And others.  That's right, my friend.  The guy who bought Elvis.  That's who, uh, whose house I was hanging out.  What actually.  Vern?  Is, when you buy Elvis, what are you buying?  You're buying the rights to Elvis.  Yeah.  You could then market his image and everything else.  Yeah.  You buy something.  That guy.  That has something to do with Elvis, this guy gets a piece.  Nice.  Nice, right?  Yeah, it's a lot of cake. 
[02:28:30]  Anyway, so what's this time scare all about, Ant?  Well, you know what happened over there in London.  You had the bombings.  We kind of said this was going to happen.  Yep.  That the panic was going to set in.  Panic.  Panic mode.  And we were going to get some silly stories.  Yeah.  Well, they had the bombings and then they had the bombings that didn't quite work.  And then we had, uh, the English, uh, police shooting a gentleman.  Sure glad the.  For no reason.  Sure glad the suicide bombers, uh, had time to go whitewater rafting together.  Jesus.  Yeah, they found, uh, pictures of these suicide bombers whitewater rafting. 
[02:29:00]  Having a little fun.  But, uh, that's the scary part of that whole thing is they're, you know, you picture them  plotting in some dimly lit room somewhere.  But, uh, even, you know, Mohammed Atta and all those animals were in Vegas watching shows,  strippers, gambling.  Gambling lap dances.  These guys are whitewater rafting.  One guy's flipping a peace sign as he's doing it.  And then they blow themselves up and kill a bunch of people.  That's why we don't like any of them.  Right.  Stop it.  So, uh, in England, they had that happen on the, uh, double-decker bus. 
[02:29:30]  And now, uh, here in New York, Opie, we have these double-decker bus, buses from England.  They shipped them over here.  They cut the roofs off the upper deck.  And tourists drive around in them.  And there's a guy on a microphone, and he points things out.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is, uh, the Empire State Building.  Get your cameras tipping up there so you can get a good view and snap away at them.  Just all the crap.  They're constantly in the way.  If you drive in New York here, if you drive in and drive out, you're a commuter. 
[02:30:00]  These things, you wish for bombs on them.  They are the worst.  They do one mile an hour in front of, uh, buildings, and you gotta try to get around them.  And it's horrible.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be pulling up to, uh, Carnegie Hall.  This is Carnegie Hall here, right on 57th Street.  And, uh, do you know, uh, how to get to Carnegie Hall?  Anyone?  Um...  Practice, ladies and gentlemen.  Practice.  That's right.  As we continue on to...  God!  Ah! 
[02:30:30]  And you're there behind them.  You're just sitting behind them, just crying.  Why don't those guys give the real tour of New York City?  Ooh.  Yeah.  Carnegie Hall and the Carnegie Deli.  I'm sure they show the Carnegie Deli as well.  Probably do.  There was an awful murder that happened above that, uh, Carnegie Deli.  The famous Carnegie Deli, known, uh, worldwide, as a matter of fact, for their sandwiches.  Look up above the Carnegie Deli.  You'll see that window up there.  That's the site of a drug deal gone wrong.  They, I guess, they pulled out, I guess, uh, six or seven bodies out of that very doorway there. 
[02:31:00]  Snap away, people.  Snap away.  And there was an actress that was in, uh, uh...  Oh, right.  There was an actress.  No One Butts, uh, Baby in a Corner.  Baby in a Corner.  Yeah, it was one of her.  That movie.  What's that movie?  Dirty Dancing.  The Dirty Dancing.  She was in that, right?  Yeah.  She was one of the bit players in that movie.  Mm-hmm.  And then she turned into a drug dealer and got shot.  Right.  Back of the head.  Bam.  Anyway, so the, uh, double-decker tour bus was... 
[02:31:30]  Was making its way down, uh, Broadway Times Square, I guess.  And, um, the driver, I guess, has, uh, they have employees on this bus, and the driver was  alerted to the fact that there were some suspicious-looking gentlemen that perhaps were dressed a little  too warmly for, uh, the weather that was out.  So he called the cops.  And, uh, the police, uh, well, I guess really without making much of a fuss, really stopped  the bus, and without, without really anyone noticing, just kind of poked around a little. 
[02:32:00]  Isn't that what happened?  I think they, uh, they called in the SWAT team.  They swarmed the bus in full battle gear and SWAT gear.  Broadway and 50th.  It was Broadway and 50th.  It was a little quiet side street.  Wow.  This is the most populated part of the most populated city.  And the reason, because the, uh, the bus driver, very paranoid.  Paranoid.  Right.  Extremely paranoid.  They had him on the news, and he didn't, he didn't seem like he was all there to begin with. 
[02:32:30]  These am the same buses they gots in England, and I was afraid.  And they were speaking with British accents, these guys.  So he was just, whatever, he got nervous.  So what?  It happens.  We all get scared.  But they were also, if you look at the pictures of them, they're also, uh, Middle Eastern men.  Well, they were Southeast Asian looking, right?  Or something like that?  They kind of had this, uh, no, they looked more from the pictures I see.  They kind of look, uh, Arab.  No, it's weird that-  I'm not sure.  The pictures on the front page of the Daily News, you know, all the, all the tourists with 
[02:33:00]  their hands up on the-  That's great.  At the top of the, uh, the bus.  It looks like they're in the middle of doing the Macarena.  A little workout.  You know, when-  They're doing, uh, aerobics.  Right.  There's something on them.  They all-  It's a picture of a double-decker bus.  Well, maybe it is the song Hands Up.  Who knows?  I'd actually prefer to be in a bus bombing than have everyone sing the Macarena.  Ugh.  Hey, Macarena.  So they cut the top of the double-decker bus off.  So you can stand up, and you don't have any, uh, roof over you on the top deck.  And all the people are standing up in their colorful tourist gear, with cameras all around 
[02:33:30]  their necks, and their arms in the air.  And just cops in combat gear with their guns out.  Their arms in the air like they just don't care ya.  Like they just don't care ya.  And they put their, uh, goods all out on the street and searched through everything and  realized that, uh, there were no shenanigans going on.  Alright, so that was just one of two.  But this is the paranoia that's going on now.  It's gonna happen occasionally.  Look, as long as you treat people with dignity, and it is important, you can't smash people's  face into the sidewalk when you're searching.  No matter how much fun it is, right?  No matter how good it would feel. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  But people have to understand this.  I'm sorry.  People are assimilating into society, and they are blowing themselves up.  How else do you handle it?  I mean, I would love to know a suggestion that might be different than this.  If there was some surefire way you can identify them by just looking, then it would be easy.  But unfortunately, that isn't happening, and we gotta put up with it.  That's one of two incidences in New York City over the weekend.  What happened with this guy at Penn Station?  Another brain surgeon.  Well, they're doing checks now at Penn Station also, and in Jersey, Metro North, all the train 
[02:34:30]  stations now, they're doing it in the tri-state area, it seems.  And one guy didn't want his bag searched.  They asked him for the bag and to search it.  Instead of giving the bag or turning away and not letting them search it, he threw the bag  at one of the guys and goes, yeah, check it.  There's a bomb in there.  Jesus.  Way to go, Einstein.  These are the same type, it's the same mentality at the airports when someone starts making 
[02:35:00]  bomb jokes online, on the security line, and then it's like, what?  No, no, I was kidding.  What?  They just don't understand the laws.  There's signs everywhere saying, do not joke about bombs.  Don't make any goof.  And they do it anyway.  And then wonder why they're getting a body cavity search in the back room.  If you say that, the cops should be able to swing a nightstick into your teeth and gum  line.  Smash.  Just knock your fucking teeth out.  A bunch of white chiclets in a red mist just flying out of your face.  By the way, the bottom row of teeth hurts a little more. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, I think these are thicker.  I could be wrong, but I think the bone density is a bit thicker on the bottom.  A nightstick with your mouth closed.  The cops should swing a nightstick into your mouth when it's closed so hard that it knocks  your teeth right out of your gums.  Whoa, they don't know you very well.  You unfunny hole with a Rocky Dennis head and a Paul Stanley wig.  That's who you are.  You're Rocky Dennis with a kiss wig.  You have to kick her right in the asshole with a jester shoe on. 
[02:36:00]  With your Andre the Giant torso.  I want to put a little curly Q, like a little Arab, like one of those, like, what kind of  shoes are they?  Like Aladdin shoes?  Yeah, Aladdin shoe.  A curly toe shoe and kick you right in your unfunny asshole, lady.  Hey, boy.  Ouch.  They don't know you very well.  She didn't say it that way.  She certainly did.  Do we have audio of that? 
[02:36:30]  We can't play it on the air, obviously.  Have you ever heard of Injunction Boys?  Injunction.  Yes.  Can you spell laugh and how you don't get them?  I didn't hear my voice on your show today.  Well, I was told that my voice wasn't played.  Yeah.  It's called the cease and desist.  Because I have people that do that for me.  Well, apparently they're not listeners because you took no phone calls, fucko.  As you will not today.  It's the Greg and Tony show.  Greg.  The Greg and Tony show.  Can we play that one sometime in this program? 
[02:37:00]  I'd love to hear it.  No, we can't do that.  Opie, I love that song.  No, we can't do that.  I love it.  I love it.  That's right.  $1,199 to go.  Tell him, Fred.  Imagine you plunk down your phone wanting to hear one of your loyal listeners and you get that.  Is that really what's going on?  The only reason I'm not saying his name is I don't know if it's right. 
[02:37:30]  I don't know.  I don't want to say.  I mean, he seemed like he's not a small guy.  He looks like he'd be really a big-ass member of the Whack Bag Board.  Right.  But I don't want to say exactly who he was.  Gotcha.  However, he's a nicer guy in person than you think.  True sociopath.  And we just had a nice chuckle last night at the Comedy Cellar.  Have fun, kids.  It's going to be another fun day.  All right.  And I forget the one that this person hinted was coming today, but it's filthy.  It's, oh, God, I wish I could remember because it's so dirty. 
[02:38:00]  Every time the phone answers, this fucking dirty thing is going to play.  Oh, oh, I knew there was another story.  Okay.  Yeah.  The O.J.  All right.  We love the O.J.  Whenever O.J.'s in the news, we love it.  They didn't give us the story.  Why wouldn't they give us the whole story?  No, it's just the actual clip.  I would like the whole story.  I think I asked for that while we were preparing for the show today.  We love when the news reporters tell the story and then we get to comment. 
[02:38:30]  And we comment.  Well, right now, it's just what I got is the 9-11 call and then O.J. commenting.  Mm-hmm.  But what is the back story on this?  Well, O.J. was home with a friend of his.  I don't remember the friend's name, though.  See?  That's what we need.  With a friend and O.J.'s girlfriend.  And apparently O.J.'s girlfriend attacked O.J., according to the friend.  And it got so out of hand, the friend tried to pull the girlfriend off of O.J. 
[02:39:00]  And she's attacking O.J.  That he decided, the friend, decided it was time to call 9-1-1 and call the police.  Because this girl was attacking O.J.  So, it's his 9-1-1 call.  Oh, here's the story?  Okay.  Hmm.  We got the story.  Uh-oh.  I smell Pat Battle's poontang.  Yeah, the only good Pat Battle poontang. 
[02:39:30]  I'll be thinking about Pat Battle when I'm pissing on your grave.  Bad Clint Eastwood impression that guy did.  Horrid.  You have the manners of a goat.  And you smell the Pat Battle.  And you have no knowledge whatsoever of your potential.  Ooh, a little untouchables?  Stick your cock apart, Pat Battle.  Ask you, motherfucking worthless cocksucker. 
[02:40:00]  I'll tell you one thing about the devil.  He uses saucy language.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So, we have the 9-1-1 call anyway, right?  Right.  All right, we can listen to that.  O.J. commenting.  O.J. just, like, laughing.  Always laughing.  Laughing through life now.  O.J. always in a great mood.  Yes.  Here's the 9-1-1 call that came in.  His girlfriend is attacking him.  His girlfriend is attacking him? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  They're fist fighting right now?  No.  What's all they're off of?  Okay, what's happening right now?  Huh?  What's happening right now?  We're waiting on you.  We're waiting on you.  So, he goes, they're fist fighting?  And the friend goes, no, no.  Because you don't want to implicate O.J. in anything.  Right.  That they're actually fist fighting.  And then he had said he pulled her off of him.  And why are they calling the cops?  Why is he calling the cops if it was done?  It's the O.J.  O.J. 
[02:41:00]  I think at this point, O.J. and his crew are just pranking everybody.  Just pranking.  Every once in a while.  Like, hey, you want to get in the news today?  Yeah.  You want to get in the news, O.J.?  You haven't been in the news in a while.  You call 9-1-1 and just tell them, you know, I'm fighting with my chick.  That's it.  Well, we had a little incident.  His dinner was cold, so he gave her a Colombian necktie in the walkway.  No, I went in the house.  He was fixing a car.  And when the person was asked to leave the property because they were a little impaired,  they kind of got into a thing. 
[02:41:30]  Were you beat up?  Nah, look at me.  Do I look beat up?  I beat up?  People don't beat me up.  I kill people.  That's really a non-story.  But it's just any time O.J.'s in the news, you've got to look at him and just go,  oh, here's the murderer guy again.  And he's laughing.  He's chuckling.  I was looking for the killers.  And she jumped on my back because she was jealous that I'm still looking for Nicole's killer.  And we had a shake off of me.  And we figured we called up.  But everything's okay now, right? 
[02:42:00]  I mean, she beat me up.  No, no, no.  Always in a great mood.  They never catch O.J. in that throat-slitting rage anymore.  They just don't catch him.  The only time we really saw O.J. pissed was when he was first arrested.  And they had him by the tree.  Remember that shot?  He was in cuffs.  Oh, yeah.  From above.  Cops had him.  It was from out on the street, like a telephoto shot.  And he had this face on that was like, wow, that's a different look for O.J. 
[02:42:30]  It was rage.  He was angry.  And you'd never seen that.  It was always smiling O.J. from the Hertz commercials and him on the sports shows and stuff.  And that was the one where you said, wow, what's this guy got brewing inside of him?  And now he never shows that anymore.  Doesn't matter what you say to this guy.  O.J., you're a murderer.  You killed two people.  Well, no, not really.  I didn't kill nobody.  I'm just O.J.  I have a good time.  We go out. 
[02:43:00]  Always fun.  Never, never any rage anymore.  But it seems that people are always drunk over his house or something.  You see how he said it?  It seems like there's one big party going on.  Somebody, and he's always very vague, somebody with a car being repaired.  The other person was impaired.  And we had to ask to leave.  But, no, everything's okay.  There's always some shenanigans going on.  Never just O.J. hanging out.  There's people, there's people getting drunk or drugged up. 
[02:43:30]  Last one was, what, Pedro Guerrero took off with his chick in a trunk full of cocaine.  And the guy can't stay out of the shit.  That was Pedro Guerrero.  All right, here's the whole story, I guess.  O.J.'s story.  The whole clip.  The whole kitten caboodle.  Whatever the hell that means.  O.J. insists that he wasn't involved.  He claims it was an argument between his girlfriend and his buddy who made the call. 
[02:44:00]  No, I went in the house.  He was fixing a car.  And when the person was asked to leave the property because they were a little impaired,  they kind of got into a thing.  Were you beat up?  Look at me.  I was beat up.  And then O.J. says he's not going to press any charges.  They don't even want to do this story.  Of course, O.J.'s not going to press any charges.  Come back on me.  But you see how vague it is?  The people, there's a call being fixed.  There's someone impaired. 
[02:44:30]  I don't know.  I wasn't even paying attention.  I was out back chipping golf balls.  That's great.  All right, we'll go to break with the O.J. prank calls that Kid Chris did.  Oh, right.  This thing has made its rounds all over radio.  What?  Oh, sure.  I like your shirt, actually.  What shirt?  Lucky 13.  Where was our old O.J. prank call bit?  Which one?  Remember that one?  With the O.J. prank call tape that he was selling on TV?  Oh, do we have that?  All right, we'll try to find that because he's in the news today. 
[02:45:00]  What the hell?  But first, this.  Yeah.  Oh, Juice?  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  What is it?  This is AC.  Let's go kill somebody tonight.  Bye.  Juice?  Yeah, hello.  O.J.  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch.  I was wondering if you could help me kill her.  What do you say, champ? 
[02:45:30]  Do I know you?  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice.  What do you say you and I go kill the Spice Girls?  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing.  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on?  I really can't talk.  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people, and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer.  O.J.  Oh, hello? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, Juice.  Yeah?  Juice, what's up?  What is this?  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around, you know, have some beers, maybe kill somebody?  Yeah.  Hi, O.J., it's Kato.  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them.  We can hold them underwater or something. 
[02:46:30]  How'd I go?  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hi, O.J.  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock Radio. 
[02:47:00]  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself, and he's just ugly, and his nose is falling off.  I don't drop it.  He's an asshole.  Eric Nagel is this bisexual and competent radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like listening to him, and he's not really that smart.  I'm sure I can go fuck himself. 
[02:47:30]  Boy, I hope I don't get sick.  Why?  I'm eating a...  What are you eating?  I'm eating a tuna fish wrap.  Never seen you eat anything different than what you eat.  You're really going off the board there.  Tuna wrap.  I got sandwiches before I left the Humpton.  Sandwiches?  And so this was sitting in...  I ate half of it.  Way, way, way. 
[02:48:00]  And then it sat in my car for three hours.  Tuna.  Tuna with mayo.  Tuna, and then I threw it in my fridge, and then...  Oh, that ought to bring it back.  And then I brought it in today, so...  Yeah, you should be...  Oh, God.  It's a little squishing outside your face.  Hmm.  Good, though.  How many mice do we have, Eric?  Uh, five.  One, two, three.  How many extra?  A couple.  Well, good luck with that, Opie. 
[02:48:30]  Tastes a little weird.  Hey, I was playing poker this weekend, of course, online, and playing with Billy Zabka.  Billy Zabka.  I know who he is.  You know who he is?  Yeah.  Who's Billy Zabka?  Yeah, I was wondering how he's been.  Yeah.  You know who he is?  No.  Never heard of him.  Here's a hint.  You know what that is? 
[02:49:00]  Gay porn star?  Yes, gay porn star.  He, uh...  He was in The Karate Kid.  It was Johnny Lawrence.  Oh.  It was the blonde-haired kid that was, uh...  Beating up on, uh...  Little Daniel.  Daniel's son.  He was on there.  He goes by his regular name.  What?  You okay?  No.  What happened?  You just threw it away.  You just gagged and threw away your sandwich.  What did you hit?  Might be bad. 
[02:49:30]  Why would you eat...  Why would you even eat that?  What's wrong with you?  Why would you eat that?  You eat yogurt?  You've been sitting around?  You just...  I don't understand.  He always does that.  Do you think this is good?  It's been here for six hours in the hot sun.  I kind of wanted to get you off.  Go ahead.  So you're making yourself sick.  Mm-hmm.  No, I was just saying I was playing poker with him and people were very excited at the table.  It was like a celebrity table because I had to call him out on the fact that he stood us up. 
[02:50:00]  He was supposed to be a guest on our show.  Remember?  Yeah.  I think when we were in L.A., right?  I think it was.  Iraq, you remember that?  Remember the blonde-haired kid from Karate Kid was supposed to be on our show?  What happened?  No.  No?  Yeah, he never...  He stood us up.  Oh, my God.  But he apologized.  We got to get him on the show.  He's an icon of 80s movies.  You got to clear that off, too, because you got a few of these guys.  You got to have four places, right? 
[02:50:30]  You got four?  Yeah, we talked about this Friday, Eric.  This is where...  Microphones.  Microphones.  We need more microphones.  This is where we make things better.  This is your first chance to make things better.  The seat.  We set it up all nice for everybody.  Men in our position cannot afford to be made to look ridiculous.  All right, Corey from Manhattan.  I have a great audio clip of Mets announcer making fun of some guy named Stanley Flamer for  obvious reasons.  Really?  I guess he did this on the air.  Where the hell do I send it to?  Send all audio to Steve at foundrymusic.com. 
[02:51:00]  Always send your audio to Steve at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Unless, and the only specification is this, if it's a picture of one guy blowing another  guy, that you send to ben.sparks at xmradio.com.  Very true.  That's the difference.  So you were playing with him.  Did you win anything?  I did pretty good over the weekend.  I was really doing shitty in the $10 buy-in rooms.  I was losing. 
[02:51:30]  I think I lost probably seven games in a row.  Dropped like seven games in a row in the $10 buy-in rooms.  And then, so of course I step it up to the $100 buy-in room because I'm a compulsive  gambler now.  Yeah, because I thought you said you were done.  I lost ten, yeah, it was like seven in a row.  And I was getting so pissed off because I wasn't in the money seven times.  I wasn't first, second, or third.  I'd be kicked out fourth.  I'd make fourth plays.  And it was awful. 
[02:52:00]  I'd have, I'd have like great hands and some asshole stays in with shit and gets lucky  on the river card and I'm out.  And that was happening.  So I figured, well, let's step it up.  Let's go $100 room.  And I won in that room.  Won in the $100 room.  And that gets you $500 when you win in the $100 buy-in room.  Right.  So it made up for all the $10 losses and more.  Now, the Karate Kid guy was out pretty early in that game. 
[02:52:30]  But he hung out and taunted other players for a while.  But they were just being ruthless to him.  They're like, oh, you lost.  What would Sensei say?  You should have swept the guy's leg that took him out.  Because you should have swept his leg like Sensei told you to.  They were pounding him on 20-year-old references.  That's great, but hammering this guy.  How do you spell Sensei?  I don't know.  I wasn't trying to spell it.  You know me.  I can't spell worth a shit.  S-E-N-S-A-Y.  Oh! 
[02:53:00]  Are you up or down overall, Ant?  It's S-E-N-S-E-I.  That's what I said.  You said S-A-Y.  Oh, did I say S-E-I?  It sounds like S-A-Y.  All right.  Are you up or down overall?  Now, I'm down.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm looking at other things in the news.  Steve licks flavored condom.  What?  What?  What's he doing? 
[02:53:30]  Huh?  Steve licks flavored condom.  Just going over some of the things we need to talk about.  Flavored condom.  Yeah.  Steve licked a flavored condom, right?  Let's see.  Moving on.  No, you don't move on from there.  Moving on.  I got to know what that's all about.  The Royal Caribbean cruise goes to Canada instead of Bermuda.  Why was he licking a flavored condom?  Why would they go to Canada?  I don't know.  No.  Back up.  Maybe there was rough weather in the Bermuda area and they decided they had to go to Canada  instead.  Back up.  Back up to what? 
[02:54:00]  Why was Steve licking flavored condoms?  Is that a whole thing of flavored condoms?  Yeah.  They look like candy.  They're in a big thing that you see like on a counter at a store.  Grape.  Oh, they smell so good.  MySexyStore.com.  Mint.  This is grape.  And Steve licked it?  Yes, he did.  Cola.  Oh, they are very pungently scented.  There's a lot of fluid on the front of it, too.  Yeah?  Are you going to lick one? 
[02:54:30]  I'm not.  Wow.  Jesus.  Ooh.  You could smell it.  Go ahead.  Take a lick.  Jimmy just did.  Let me roll it on first.  And then taste it over and over again.  Until there's no more flavor.  Keep tasting until I tell you to stop and get lost.  Oh, yeah.  These are goopy.  Well, there goes the bit because Jimmy just casually licked the condom like it was nothing.  That's not funny anymore.  No, it's not even funny anymore. 
[02:55:00]  You didn't have to say it on the air.  I just did.  I didn't care.  Mint, strawberry, grape, cola.  Where's Steve?  These recording IDs.  Ooh, these are saucy.  With Mudvayne?  Yes.  Mudvayne in studio today in a little while.  Take those home.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Steve licked the flavored condom, and obviously it was no big deal.  Steve, how was that condom?  Banana.  Uh, oh, I took a strawberry one, and it's, it, yeah, that one.  You popped it in your mouth, did you?  No, I licked the tip of it. 
[02:55:30]  You licked the tip.  Just the tip.  That's not gay.  Just the tip, because it's not gay if it's just the tip.  And, uh, did you unroll it first?  No.  No?  What did it taste like?  I think if condoms straight out of the wrapper tasted like ass, they'd sell very few of them.  It tasted like it was covered in flavored sex lube, which I have had before, and, eh,  doesn't really do much, yeah.  Mmm.  Tasty.  All right.  Indeed.  I wouldn't have dove right in and tasted it like that.  Oh, jeez.  Did you grab the back of your own head when you did it? 
[02:56:00]  I certainly did.  Fight a little.  He even said, please no, please no.  Oh, oh.  Ramon, get me a grape.  And also on the front page of the New York Post today, the pop shock.  What's this story about?  Dad must pay for secret sperm tot.  This is pretty amazing.  Secret sperm tot.  And the guy's got to pay?  And this is front page news today.  You know, showing the importance in this country.  That gets more space on the front page than the New York terror scare that we just talked about. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, pop shock.  A Brooklyn man says his estranged wife forged his signature on a form to get his frozen sperm.  Who did hope?  I'm sorry.  I actually did not hear that.  A Brooklyn man says his estranged...  Oh, I said the word wrong.  No, no, no.  Look at Jimmy.  A Brooklyn man says his wife that he no longer likes forged his signature on a form to get his frozen sperm and then used it to conceive a daughter.  Well, how long have they been estranged?  I'm not playing your stupid game. 
[02:57:00]  Nah, dude, if I see a G in a word, I just remove it.  Just take it out.  You don't say wait-gt.  No.  So, Ant and I...  Silly narrative.  I'm going to drag Anthony into this one.  So, Ant and I don't talk as well as you, Jimmy.  What can we say?  He was ordered to pay child support, and now he's filed a $9 million suit naming his wife and the fertility clinic, Anthony.  Of course.  If he didn't...  If he said, no way, I'm not releasing my sperm to you, and she forged it, why the hell has he got to pay? 
[02:57:30]  Holy crap, it's a black couple.  $9 million.  $9 million seed money.  What does he do?  Yeah, what does he do?  Do they have money?  A Brooklyn man who claims his wife that he doesn't really get along with...  Doesn't like anyone.  ...forged his name to get hold of his frozen sperm and use it to conceive a daughter, has been ordered to pay child support,  and has filed a multi-million dollar suit for reimbursement.  The lawyer for the unwitting dad, Long Island Railroad engineer, Dion Francis, says New York University's famed fertility clinic should be responsible for the little girl's expenses through college. 
[02:58:00]  That's insanity.  The bizarre saga began in 1997 when this guy, Dion, and his wife, Shamil, holy S, are these names getting out of hand.  C-H-A-A-M-E-L.  Shamil.  Son of Mr. and Mrs. Schlamazel.  Stupid. 
[02:58:30]  Shamil.  Hassan Pfeffer Incorporated.  Married, five years later, unable to conceive, the couple consulted experts at NYU, and Dion provided a sperm sample in July 2002.  Yeah.  But the marriage hit the rocks, and Dion left Shamil in April 2003.  Dion's lawyer, John James, said that according to the NYU contract, the frozen sperm should have been destroyed when his client stopped paying storage fees.  Personally, I think that NYU should pay the child support and put this child through college.  He absolutely shouldn't have to pay a dime for that one. 
[02:59:00]  In court papers, Dion 34 claims that Shamil 36 paid the storage fees until December 2003 when she forged his name on a release,  had it notarized, and underwent the first of two in vitro fertilizations.  The following August, Dion visited his wife and said he was shocked to see her pregnant.  I said, so who are you pregnant from?  He recalled.  She said, it's yours.  I said, don't tell me you went to the clinic and did what I think you did.  And there you go.  Oh, bitch.  There you go.  Now he pretty much wants $9 million. 
[02:59:30]  Nine mil, huh?  Nine mil.  Yeah, it's always about that money.  That kid is not that important.  Let's slow down.  Put this in perspective.  All right.  And that's the news for today.  That's it, huh?  Yeah, I think we covered pretty much all the news.  And we got, you want to say hi to Mudvayne?  Certainly.  They seem pretty bored out there.  Oh, yeah?  They're doing the Ozzy, uh, they're doing the OzFest thing.  Yes.  That's a great gig to be on, man.  Phenomenal. 
[03:00:00]  We got Chad and I think we got the whole band.  You know, you're going to have big crowds.  Chad, Greg, Ryan, Matt, right?  We got the whole gang today, Chad.  As I'm yelling through the door as these guys are coming through.  They're on their cell phones.  What's up, yo?  How you doing?  Gentlemen.  Do we actually need these?  Nah.  Nah.  Oh, you look really serious.  You don't want to hear the callers.  Are we doing callers?  Is that what we do?  Sometimes. 
[03:00:30]  We don't have to do anything.  Well, let's fucking get low in here.  What's going on?  You look very serious.  You all right?  You just woke up?  I play in a rock band.  Are you annoyed?  I was supposed to have gone to bed an hour ago.  Yeah.  You don't know the rock and roll lifestyle, Opie.  It's about sleeping late, staying out late, and early shit like this just kind of annoys  you, right?  Yeah.  You need to go back to the, you know, up all night, sleep all day.  That is some morning voice you got going. 
[03:01:00]  Absolutely.  Was it like an hour last night?  I'm a comic.  I deal with the same shit.  It's fucking, you're up at like three o'clock in the morning, you get an hour of sleep.  I think about 30 minutes.  Yeah, it was pretty hot.  Damn.  Where are you guys coming from?  I don't know.  No clue.  Where were we from?  D.C.  Oh, no.  It wasn't called D.C., though.  That's right.  Bristol something.  Bristol.  Yeah.  Bristol.  Do you really lose track when you're on the road, what city you're in after a while?  I don't know what day it is.  Absolutely.  I have no idea what day it is.  You're just kind of on the rail. 
[03:01:30]  There it is.  Could be Saturday.  Get through with the shows.  Some people say rock and roll.  Some people say retarded.  Yeah.  That's me.  Do you guys hate being on the road or what?  Love it.  Absolutely hate it.  Love it.  I love it.  Do you really?  Oh, that's a curse.  I mean, what's your dream?  You guys get so big you don't have to tour anymore?  No, I mean, I'm serious.  I mean, there are guys that, you know, that ain't happening anytime soon.  Well, but if you hate it, you know, why do it?  I said I love it. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, he loves it.  Sometimes things are just a little bit bigger than you are.  Really?  Yeah.  The whole thing kind of grew a little.  Yeah.  Were you happier just kind of kicking it?  And then clubs and...  Basements.  Shit like that.  Basements, really?  Basements, obvious.  Doesn't every band, though, get together with the final goal, the dream of doing what  you're doing?  Being on a huge tour?  And, you know, that seems to be what you get together for when you're younger.  Absolutely.  Younger.  Younger.  And then you finally get...  Then you get there and you're... 
[03:02:30]  Brilliant.  And then you get there and you're like, fuck.  Yeah, you realize you had to sell your soul to Beelzebub, you know?  Yeah, you have your idea of what it's going to all be about, and then, yeah, you have to  sign a few contracts with some businessmen.  Things you never wanted to do.  Totally.  Well, you guys are going on, like, right...  You're on the main stage.  You're going on right before Maiden and Sabbath.  I mean, that's got to be phenomenal as a band to be working with those two bands.  Absolutely.  Did you get a picture with Sabbath?  No.  No.  I'm such a fucking stalker.  I get photos of everybody.  Jimmy's all about the celebrity photos. 
[03:03:00]  I fucking...  Do they get a photo together?  Are they ever together at any other point other than...  In Sabbath Village, maybe, you'll see them, that little area where the trailers  are?  Oh, I don't know.  No.  I stared at Bill Ward for 45 minutes until he fucking finally took a picture with me.  He was just warming up on his drums, and I just sat there and stared at him.  Wait, those guys don't want to be together at all?  You think?  I didn't say that.  I just...  You just haven't seen them together.  I just...  I would...  You know, I think it would be...  It would be easy to presume that they probably don't get together at any other time.  Really?  Than being on stage. 
[03:03:30]  Just on stage and then...  Bill's really cool.  Yeah, he's great.  He's super approachable.  Just a cool guy.  Hangs out.  Like, he's up on the deck during the day.  Just tweaking on his drums, saying hey to everybody.  I annoyed Geezer and Iommi.  Like, fucking kind of stalking them outside the tour bus.  And I think I scared Geezer back out of the bus.  That kind of does annoy people, yeah.  I can't help it.  I didn't really stalk him.  I just kind of stood there, but fuck him.  What were we talking about?  We were talking about why I hate touring?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, that'll do it, huh?  What, the stalkers?  Well, I mean...  Stalkers. 
[03:04:00]  I'm sure that's one reason to...  Fans, stalkers.  Yeah.  What, do they annoy the shit out of you, though?  Always asking for something?  Pictures, autographs?  That's kind of big...  I guess, you know what, if they'd ask, that might be alright.  But, you know, people running up to you and sticking a camera in your face, you know?  Really?  Yeah, totally.  Yeah, it sucks.  Oh, yeah, totally.  But that's kind of...  And they would say, that's kind of, hey, you know, you wanted to...  This lifestyle of the rock star kind of thing is kind of the position you put yourself in.  You're going to have to deal with it.  Hmm.  No, huh? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  You don't see it that way?  No.  Well, how do you see it, then?  I play drums.  Yeah.  That's all I do.  That's all I ever signed up for, playing drums.  And the rest of the stuff just annoys the hell out of you.  Well, just, you know, he didn't say on the resume, be a professional model, you know?  Right.  Also.  Yeah.  Didn't see that one coming.  Would you rather work for a living?  What's that?  Would you rather work for a living, like a real job, or...?  I am working for a living.  Come on.  No, I know.  I know.  Like, I got to come in and go to work every morning.  But believe me, this isn't work. 
[03:05:00]  I worked.  I worked at some point in my life, you know?  I actually was in construction for a while.  I ran my own custodial business.  See?  That's what I mean by working for a living.  Obviously, you work hard playing and, you know, doing what you do.  I mean, we keep crazy hours, absolutely.  But would you rather be...  18-hour video shoots, right?  Would you rather be installing, you know, drywall or something?  You know, you wouldn't have anybody bothering you.  He's done it.  Yeah.  I've done it, actually, yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't...  No, I'm thinking once this rock star thing is done, I'm going to go back to school and 
[03:05:30]  get an art history degree.  Really?  Absolutely.  I'm working in a museum.  That's it.  That's it.  I'm a curator.  I don't mean to laugh.  I'm not.  Back to the drywall.  Yeah.  Back to the drywall.  I want to be a tour guide.  Yeah?  Yeah, absolutely.  Maybe at the Wadsworth Thothenium in Connecticut.  That would be hot because you're such a people person.  I am.  I am.  But you know what?  Yeah, you're really coming...  But you know what?  No, hold on.  Hold on.  If you're taking somebody on a museum tour, you don't really have to be nice to anybody. 
[03:06:00]  All you have to do is walk around and tell the people what they're looking at.  Hey, the people that work in museums are assholes.  That's P.A.  Mondrian over there.  They're assholes.  It was done in 1931.  Just hope nobody wants to...  Right when he went into his boogie-woogie phase.  Just hope that no one wants to take your picture in front of the chart close.  Why would anybody want to take my picture if I'm a museum tour guide?  Just so they can show...  Who would care?  Just so they can show...  Just so they can show the power of the photorealism.  Oh.  Well, I would be game for that, you know?  There's still got to be something phenomenal. 
[03:06:30]  This is the difference between comics and rock people.  It's just got to be...  To get blown on a bus has got to be the fucking greatest thing ever.  Blow what?  To get blown on a bus?  Never have I been blown on a bus.  He just did a big gig in Cleveland.  He got nothing.  Two shows...  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't fucking matter.  Two sold-out theater shows and he got nothing after the shows.  I'm not actually sure what we're talking about.  Getting a blowjob on a bus by a hot groupie girl.  Oh.  Yeah.  I'm...  Huh.  See, once again, we've fallen into those rock cliches and expectations of what being 
[03:07:00]  in a band and touring is about.  Interesting.  We must all live vicariously through you rock stars.  What can we say?  Yeah.  Well, what is going on on the rock bus?  Uh, reading...  Everyone assumes there's a lot of drugs and drinking and naked girls.  You tell us...  What is on the...  Not on the Mudvayne bus.  Uh, no?  Well, what's on the rock bus?  Drinking, obviously.  All right.  So the drinking is...  And maybe occasional drugs.  All right.  So we got the drugs, right?  I got a Philip K. Dick book right now.  Really?  Reading Valis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get a lot of reading. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That really does kind of part ways from the...  From the naked chicks.  All these...  Yeah, all these strange expectations.  No naked chicks whatsoever.  We're crazy to think that, I guess.  Yeah, the booze and the drugs are accurate, but the chicks...  You're probably turning them down.  That's why you're not.  You probably...  I don't know if you're married.  Do you have a girl?  Maybe you're just going, no, I don't want to fuck around the road.  Too risky.  Okay.  Yeah, so you don't want to fuck around the road, but you probably could if you wanted to.  Actually, probably not.  Girls don't really like Mudvayne very much.  No?  We could probably get as many 12 to 14-year-old pimply-faced boys that we want, right, Chad? 
[03:08:00]  Oof.  Even better.  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to Mike.  He has a question for you guys.  Mike, what's going on?  Hello?  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, question for you.  He's standing there.  If you're giving a little Jimmy shit about wanting to take pictures of stars, how do  you feel about the people who are spending their hard-earned money to go out and buy your  damn album and not willing to give them a couple seconds to return?  I don't think he was giving people shit about getting pictures.  He was just saying he wanted them to ask, like just saying, hey, can I get a picture?  It's not one of your favorite things to do, is what you're saying. 
[03:08:30]  No, I didn't say we don't do pictures with people.  We do pictures with people every day.  And I think what we were mentioning about were the stalkers, the people that come out of  nowhere and flash pictures at you and you don't even know they're there and they don't  even approach you and introduce themselves.  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to BJ.  Not liking that.  BJ, what's up?  Not much.  Hey, Mudvin, how you doing?  What's up, man?  I just had a question about the whole face paint and the mask things that you used to  do.  How come you guys dropped that?  Was it just something that you outgrew, got bored of? 
[03:09:00]  Who said we dropped it?  Or was it because when you started doing the alien faces, it kind of turned into a gimmick and  it was gay?  Okay, so he just answered his own question.  There you go.  We decided that it was just way too gay.  We were just trying to get out of it.  You know, it was just a gaytrocity.  Let's go to Frank in New York City.  Frank, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Who are these disingenuous, whining fucks who said they'd rather work for a living?  Shut up. 
[03:09:30]  Get up and get a job and get up every day like the rest of us.  I don't think they said they'd rather work for a living.  I didn't sign up for this.  I just signed up to drum.  Shut up.  Wow.  Sir, I take it you're having a slight problem.  Wow.  Yeah.  The fun show just...  Good morning.  It's very fun, isn't it?  Don't have a good time here.  What happened?  We were having fun.  I hope that you're waking up to do customer service work.  Good morning, sir.  No, I have a real job and I work hard every day.  But anybody would trade their left nut to have your life and your wine because you have 
[03:10:00]  to take a couple of pictures.  Well, no.  Who was complaining?  Dude, I think he felt an attitude from you, Matt.  That's all.  You don't sound very happy with your job, sir.  Yeah.  Didn't it sound like Opie and Anthony were kind of like pressing me to like have some fun  and talk about the job and maybe, you know, say why we didn't want to wake up this morning?  Wasn't that kind of a dig that we were doing there?  We were kind of doing that together?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's kind of what we were doing.  Did we roll into New York?  All right, Frank.  Yeah, you guys are really low this morning. 
[03:10:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm having a hard time hearing you.  Okay, thanks.  All right, man.  There he goes.  Yeah, well, this is coming in a lot, though.  Seth in Jersey.  Seth.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Couldn't be better.  Hey.  Listen, I'm like the other guy.  I'm happy with my job, but it's just kind of aggravating when you hear a good band that's  been out as popular, doing very well, that comes across when the drummer says, you know,  I didn't sign up to do this, you know, I'm just here to drum.  Dude, actually, you're here, you know, your fans pay a lot of money to come out, harder 
[03:11:00]  than money to come out, buy your album, see you.  The last thing they want to hear is you complaining and saying, this is the last thing I want to  do.  I didn't sign up to be a model.  All right.  I file my official apology.  I apologize.  We were just having a little fun.  I apologize.  My condolences to everybody that works.  I really appreciate people coming to the shows, and it's an honor to be able to be playing  NASFest right now, and we love it.  You're definitely, I mean, you're definitely still having fun doing this, right?  Of course.  Of course.  That's why we do it.  There you go. 
[03:11:30]  There you go.  Let's go into some other things here.  John in Iowa.  What's up, John?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, I really like that new album.  It's really good.  The whole album's great.  It's been a long time since I've heard a real good rock album, but there's a song on there.  It's got these freaky little voices that go, eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  And I just wanted to know what was behind that, maybe, and who did it.  I don't know.  I think the...  Well, the name of the song is Choices. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, the name of the song is Choices, and it's...  The new CD's Lost and Found, by the way.  It's that game that every kid plays, you know, eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  Um, so, uh, that's the idea behind it, is making a choice, and the, um, the people on it were, uh, our producer's children.  Yeah, it was Dave Orman's kids.  He's got two daughters and a son that came in and did it.  Well, you did it, too, with him.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  All right, let's say, uh, hi to another Chad.  Chad, what's up? 
[03:12:30]  Hey.  Chad, you've got the coolest name on the planet.  Yeah, first off, I can attest to the fact that Matt is a very, very kind individual if you show him respect.  Thank you.  I really appreciate you saying so.  That's all we were trying to say.  And you were going to say Chad's an asshole, right?  No, you know what, I really, I really appreciate you saying so.  Yeah, um...  Because I enjoy meeting people, and I enjoy making friends.  I just don't like being stalked.  Oh, yeah, I completely understand.  But I want to know what brought about the change between Lost and Found, and especially, uh, the second half of LB50. 
[03:13:00]  Was it just, uh, personal growth, or...?  You know, we've kind of had, we keep an attitude, uh, with our creative process that we're not trying to recreate a moment,  but we're trying to find out where the band is at the time that we're writing.  So, I mean, I don't know if it's change or growth, it's just, you know, life is, uh, life changes, and life moves along.  And, you know, the band's a different band than we were four years ago.  People do get pissed off at that. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  And a lot, they like to throw out the word sellout a lot whenever you do something.  And they don't understand that a band is a group of guys that are, the longer you're together, the more you're going to change.  Absolutely.  Your ideas change, your, uh, the gel between the guys and everything, and, and, uh, you're going to be different.  Why does it have to remain the same?  You don't want to keep writing the same record.  No.  You know what I mean?  You'll have just as many people pissed off at you.  And if you're lucky enough...  Keep doing the same thing over and over and over again.  You want your music to be honest.  I mean, that's the one, that's what we really, really strive for.  And if you're lucky enough to be successful long enough, uh, you'll have people crawling out of the woodwork saying, 
[03:14:00]  these motherfuckers, man, they were great years back, and then, uh, now they've sold out, they've changed.  You can't try to meet people's expectations.  Nah.  You know, I mean, and I, I always, I always felt like if we were smart enough, maybe we could have been a pop band,  and, you know, we could second guess what people like to listen to, but I don't think we're that, quite that smart.  I think with us, you know, what, what our fans have appreciated is just the, the honesty.  You know, we just try to make the most honest music we can.  You, uh...  More lucky people like it. 
[03:14:30]  You read message boards or anything about...  No.  No?  You don't even touch them?  I want to do, uh, I want to do a Mudvane haters message board on our site.  Because...  We already have one, don't we?  Just to get...  Yeah.  No, we, that's the only one we have.  That's the whole thing is, well, whenever you have a lot of people with message boards, that, for some reason,  the people that are attracted to that are the people that really just want to bash the shit out of you.  Most people don't even have anything to say about Mudvane.  Really?  It's like...  They're just literally just talking. 
[03:15:00]  A lot of infighting?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just a strange thing, the message boards.  I do know that, or at least I think, anybody who has a message board dedicated to them or that they're involved with in some way, shape, or form, does read...  You go to it at some point.  Have you ever read a post on a message board?  Uh-uh.  You?  On ours?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I haven't.  You're...  I mean, people tell me all the time.  Yeah?  Because that's odd that you wouldn't.  Yeah.  You know, I just...  A lot of people do. 
[03:15:30]  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't say anything.  Maybe I should just keep my mouth open.  You know, dude, if you were into your fans, you'd read their fucking posts.  I like this, Matt.  Matt, you're all right.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Right when the record came out.  Yeah.  Like, just...  Out of curiosity, you want to see what...  It's like...  Whatever.  Yeah.  Like, people not even talking about the record.  I'm going...  Chet.  Yeah.  You know? 
[03:16:00]  You want to get some feedback or something?  Somebody say something about it.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Go to Amazon.com and read all those posts.  It's like where you can buy the record.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  You might see something there.  Are you guys all from Peoria?  No.  We're all from different parts of central Illinois.  Illinois.  You're Richard Pryor fans?  Absolutely.  All right.  Good.  Because you're from Peoria.  I read that.  I was very happy.  I just watched You're Crazy the other night.  Doesn't his son still live there?  I think he has a son that lives in Peoria.  Really?  I mean, I don't know any more than that, but... 
[03:16:30]  Let's say hi to Tim in Tennessee.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning, Man Mellons.  Hey, I was listening to those other callers whine about guys in the band not wanting to  take pictures, and last time I checked, you buy a CD, you get the music on the CD, and  that's what you're paying for, and if these guys don't want to take time to do anything  else, well, that's too fucking bad.  That's not really what they said.  Matt just doesn't like to be stalked and...  No, no, no, he's actually agreeing.  The guys in the band have everyone... 
[03:17:00]  No, I know he's agreeing, but he's also saying that the other calls were saying you guys don't  like it at all.  That's not what the point of Matt was making.  No, you know what, we do, every day we do meet and greets and stuff every single day.  We're doing 150 people a day at OzFest or whatever it is.  Well, you think about that, you know, if you do a minute per person, that's 150 minutes,  and you guys don't have time to take a shit, so...  You don't do a minute per person.  I'm all for a free choice, and whatever you guys want to do, just keep putting out good  tunes.  I appreciate that, man.  Punch it out.  All right, let's say hi to Rob on Long Island. 
[03:17:30]  Rob, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Thanks for having me.  Oh, great music, guys.  Me and my brother are big fans.  I first saw you guys at the Summer Sanitarium Tour at Giant Stadium a couple years back,  but I wanted to ask where you guys got your name from, because from what I hear,  it's like a slang for asshole.  I just wanted to know if that's true.  Well, I often wondered about that.  You know, that never occurred to me, actually.  After we threw that out there, like, years ago, I was thinking, man, I hope that people  don't think that, but...  Yeah, is that like an anal reference?  Yeah, that's an anal reference.  Yeah, it sure is.  Absolutely. 
[03:18:00]  That actually came from...  Have you ever heard of a fish called a carp?  You ever heard of that fish?  Yeah, he's out, but...  Yeah.  He's gone, or whatever, and I was literally driving around the Decatur Dam, and I looked down  and I saw some people fishing, and I was like...  I remembered fishing there with my dad, or whatever, and it was just like really boring,  and like no action, and no fishing.  Basically, you just sit there with your line in the water, and every once in a while, you  catch a carp, and it'd be like, woo, got one on, woo! 
[03:18:30]  You know, you'd reel it in, and it'd be like, oh, it's a carp.  You can't keep that one, and you throw it back, because it's got a mud vane.  So, that's where I came up with it.  You know what?  I've never heard that story.  That's the first time I've heard that story.  Yeah.  I've never heard that.  I thought it was the pink laser shot from the Sirius Star System that sent the name  like right at the top of my brain, the pink laser.  I was driving around the dam when the pink laser hit me.  You were struck by the pink laser from the Sirius Star System. 
[03:19:00]  The dog star.  The dog star.  Let's go to Rich in Ohio.  Rich, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Little Jimmy.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Yo, mud vane, you guys fucking tore it up Saturday.  Awesome.  Thank you.  I saw you up at the Burgerstown at the Post-Cazette Pavilion, and these motherfuckers that say  that you guys don't work apparently ain't never been to one of your shows.  Thank you.  Because I am a fucking lobster today, my forehead, my nose, my arms.  Oh, man.  At fucking 4 o'clock, everybody I was with was, come on, let's go.  I can't fucking take it anymore.  I'm like, kiss my ass, motherfucker. 
[03:19:30]  I ain't leaving until mud vane's done.  So, you guys rock, and I still feel it because I'm on fire.  Awesome, man.  You know, one thing that we always, you know,  we've always tried to bring to the stage is,  I know it sounds kind of idealistic or whatever,  but, like, we treat every show, like, as a singular moment.  And it's a moment that the fans and that we get to have that's unlike any other.  And every show is that.  And it kind of, I think it keeps us pretty vital  and keeps us pretty excited about our shows. 
[03:20:00]  I mean, we get really excited about playing.  That's what we do.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Dave in Queens.  Dave!  Yo, what's going on?  What's up, Dave?  What's up, man?  Nothing all fucking good.  Yo, I saw you guys way before you guys broke out  when you were playing with Ultra Spank and Slipknot down in Houston.  There you go.  2000, probably.  You guys are fucking ridiculous that night.  I went there to see Slipknot.  I left being a huge fan of you guys.  And I'm glad to know you guys are fucking assholes, too,  because it helps me relate a lot more.  It really does.  It helps me relate with you motherfuckers.  Yo, love you guys. 
[03:20:30]  Fucking Jimmy.  Yes.  Oh, man, what I do to suck on your meaty tits, you fucker.  You are a good egg.  Gotta love the satellite radio.  Good egg.  Wow.  Let's go to Joe and...  Sounds like you got your own stalker.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking complete psycho.  We got many.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey, Mudvayne.  You guys fucking rock.  Awesome record.  Thank you.  Love all the records.  As a matter of fact, my four-year-old daughter loves to get in the truck,  and she said, Daddy, put on the Eenie, Meenie, Marnie, Moe song.  She's getting ready to celebrate her fourth birthday, you know. 
[03:21:00]  Congrats.  You guys know you got a four-year-old Mudvayne fan out there.  Dude, you know what?  I probably hear that in the signing line every day.  Like, I mean, I hear so much about people saying, you know,  putting on Determined and their kids dancing to it and stuff.  Yeah, that's awesome.  So that's really cool, man.  Awesome.  Hey, thanks, guys.  All right.  You guys ever think it would have gotten this big?  Oh, absolutely not.  This is an absolute anomaly.  Like, when you start out, you guys...  We've got together, you had fun playing together, 
[03:21:30]  thought you'd do some local gigs and have a good time, right?  You know, really, for us, it was about writing.  I mean, we really enjoyed just writing music.  Do you remember the moment when you realized, oh, my God.  Yeah, absolutely.  Holy crap, this is going to take off.  Yeah, absolutely.  What was it?  Was it anything good?  Was it hearing it on the radio, a song on the radio?  You know, we've got...  We have, like, a little bit of personal mythology in the band,  and at a certain point, we collectively identified a moment and specified it 
[03:22:00]  and said, this is the point forever.  This is the now forever.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  You had a sign?  Well, there was a moment where we just realized, like, what we were doing...  The gravity of what it was.  You know, it meant something in that people were probably going to receive it,  and we wanted to be a part of it.  It was about six months before we got a record contract.  And make it our whole life, you know?  And that's when it was all kind of...  Absolutely. 
[03:22:30]  It got a little bit bigger than just us, like we were saying in the beginning of the interview.  Um...  I don't know.  I don't want to say too much more.  Why?  Sounds kind of interesting, actually.  Well, it just sounds to me like devil worship.  Sounds like ritual.  There's a little bit of that ritual.  A little satanic ritual.  Sounds like it might have been a Ouija board.  Are we going to get popular?  When we got...  After we got a record deal, I was like...  Actually, we just shook that eight thing.  Yeah, the eight ball. 
[03:23:00]  The magic eight ball.  I was going to say it wasn't an eight ball.  And we flipped it over and it said, yes.  I said, yes.  And I was like, oh my God.  When we got signed, I at one point said I would be shocked if we sold 150,000 records.  Or sold 100,000 records.  Like, that was not going to be possible.  And you guys have sold at least 200.  Yeah, we actually...  You know what?  I think we hit close to two, didn't we?  200?  We're getting there.  We're getting there.  We're working at it.  We're still hoping.  I'm going to ask you a question, too.  Bill Ward, most underrated drummer ever. 
[03:23:30]  He's a jammin' drummer.  You know what was really...  Ridiculous.  Like, when he's just...  Yeah, sitting around, like what you probably saw.  Holy shit.  He is really, really good.  Really good.  It's like, you can tell that he's not just, you know, showing up two weeks before the  tour starts to, okay, I've got to play drums again, haven't seen him for a year kind of  thing.  No, he's into it.  You can tell he is about drumming.  He can play.  He can really play.  All right, let's say hi to Joey on Long Island.  He's got a question.  Joey! 
[03:24:00]  Hey, Joey.  Hey.  What's up?  Turn down your radio.  You're on.  Can you hear me?  Yep.  Hey, I'm a big fan.  I heard a lot about your band.  Is it true that Pat Battle sings back up on your last album?  Who?  See ya!  Pat Battle.  Just an ass.  Okay.  What else can I tell you?  Just an ass.  What?  She's a newscaster that we're obsessed with.  People throw her name out.  It's not even worth explaining to these guys.  They're big rock stars.  They don't care.  Hey, you know what?  I don't care about it.  I've got battle. 
[03:24:30]  They love doing what we do.  I've got better things to do with my times.  Go do some drywalling.  Mike in Winter Haven.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, how are you?  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Look, the first one I heard from you guys is dig.  And right at the time, I was playing paintball.  And like every tournament, we'd turn that sucker.  We'd turn it up.  And we'd just crank it out and just beat each other up right before a game.  And we'd go and just wreck house against these guys. 
[03:25:00]  It just turned on that switch inside me that just said, go out and just wreck it, man.  Awesome.  Thanks so much, guys.  You guys rock.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  Look at that.  Awesome.  Let's say hi to David in St. Louis.  David.  Hi.  I just want to say that I saw you guys in St. Louis and thought you guys were awesome.  It was at .517.  Sure.  I was just wondering, how would you guys like playing to sold-out crowds?  Yeah, that was the first time we'd headlined a sold-out radio gig.  That was pretty wacky.  I enjoy playing to sold-out crowds. 
[03:25:30]  A lot more than there's nobody there.  You had to have had the shit gigs early on where you'd. . .  All right, dude, we're talking about St. Louis here.  Our home.  My home area.  Like, we went down to the Creepy Crawl.  Yep.  And everyone left.  Well, no, no, no.  That was in Denver.  No, that was in Denver.  Also in Quad Cities and in Chicago.  Where Greg was going, I was sick as a dog.  Literally, we just were going out on a tour. 
[03:26:00]  When we were financing everything ourselves, we get out to Denver, and all of a sudden,  I just get crazy sick.  I couldn't even speak.  And Greg is standing next to me at the bar going, dude, here, do a shot of Jack.  No, here, do a shot of tequila.  It'll loosen up your voice.  It's the only time I've ever went on stage with a bus.  The only time.  Really?  Ever.  We don't drink or do anything before we play.  I was wasted.  But yeah, the Creepy Crawl.  We played to like...  Ten people?  Ten people, maybe. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  We just did on...  We went back there for that specific reason.  Probably the Gorilla.  When we released the new record.  Yeah, and we did the whole Gorilla Run.  It was all small clubs like that, and we just...  We went to the Creepy Crawl and packed that bitch.  A few more of them.  It was really crazy, because my drum kit was on the edge.  Is that the show he's talking about?  Which one?  The Creepy Crawl.  Yeah.  He didn't do a sold-out show.  Oh, no, no.  I think he's talking about the...  Well, that was a sold-out show also.  175 people probably. 
[03:27:00]  I was sitting on the corner of the stage in a pillar next to me, and all the fans were  literally just standing around my kit as close as fans.  It was me playing, and everybody just standing there.  That's cool.  That was pretty crazy.  That Gorilla Run was awesome.  Fans helping me do cymbal chokes.  There was no...  I can grab it, you know.  Yeah, we got a good friend of the show calling in to say hi.  All right, Jay Moore, everyone.  Jay!  I just want to remind everybody that this past Saturday, Jim Norton is at the Cleveland  Odeon.  Oh, thank you, Jay.  It was very helpful, your plug. 
[03:27:30]  How you doing, Jay?  I'm doing good.  How did it go, Jimmy?  It was good, actually.  Both shows are great, and just I fucking struck out horribly with chicks.  Hey, Jay.  So what, you were on like a little...  You were on like a stand-up tour kind of thing?  I just...  I went out and did Cleveland on a Saturday.  And no girls on your bus?  They make it sound like you're gay.  I was saying...  I took a fucking van from the hotel.  Yeah, that's the problem there.  You got to have a sexy bus.  What, Jay?  Every time people talk about stand-up comedy, they make it sound like we're gay.  What are you doing, a little stand-up thingy? 
[03:28:00]  He's like, this guy just stopped for 45 fucking minutes, performing for 40 people and vomiting.  Two shows on a goddamn theater, two shows in a row.  He's like, oh, they're cute.  Wow.  Oh, you're right, man.  We do stink as comics.  Fuck.  Yeah, Jay, we got Mudvane in the studio today.  I know.  I know Mudvane from OzFest.  Nice.  Very good.  Do you guys know who Jay Moore is?  I'm not familiar, myself.  I apologize.  You'd know him in a second if you saw him.  Where would I know him from? 
[03:28:30]  Saturday Night Live.  That's not understanding.  Oh.  I'm terrible with TV.  I don't see enough TV.  Suicide Kings, great movie.  Oh, Suicide Kings.  Yeah, absolutely.  Jay was in Suicide Kings and many, many others.  Oh, okay.  Let's not forget Pauly.  Oh, you don't know.  The kids love Pauly.  The kids love Pauly.  The kids love Pauly.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  I have exceptional news for you two guys.  Yes?  Yes, Jay.  For three.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Well, there's two others in the studio.  It's five today.  Five. 
[03:29:00]  Well, I don't know them and they don't know me, so let's just make a whole thing out of  it.  Okay.  We got Chad and Matt.  I don't want to get caught in the crossfire.  I saw your movie.  Paul Anka is the guest star on Las Vegas today in the filming.  Oh, really?  Oh, he also...  Can I say bang or should I say seeing?  How about live with?  Live with.  Cohabitating.  He lives with Nicky Cox.  I totally know who you are.  Let's do it.  Now they're seeing a picture of you. 
[03:29:30]  You're like a movie star.  Hey, do you like Stalkers and having your picture taken?  Only when I'm actually in the bed.  Nice.  Absolutely.  I know who you are.  Here's a glamorous story about Jay Moore.  Jay and I were doing a college together in Florida years ago.  You were in a...  Did you play in a...  Jerry Maguire?  Yeah, I was going to say Jerry Maguire.  It's not going to sound stupid if I say that.  Yeah.  Awesome.  See, Jay, you just impressed them.  He was the scumbag agent.  But I want to hear Jimmy Stewart.  Oh, this is a cute one.  I'm opening for Jay in a college in Florida.  And he goes, hey, Jim, Jim, come in here. 
[03:30:00]  And I walk into his hotel suite and I walk into his room and he's on his bed naked on his  hands and knees with his asshole open laughing.  Wow.  You know what?  Beat that, Mudvayne.  I would say people, you know, almost every interview, say, oh, what's the craziest thing  that's happened to Mudvayne on the tour site?  I'm speechless right now.  I don't know about that one.  It won my back.  I couldn't even...  I couldn't get within two feet of that.  Well, if you were to tell you, Mudvayne, two things happen with that antics that I pulled. 
[03:30:30]  One is...  Two things are going to happen.  One, you're either going to get fucked, or the two, and I'm going to leave you alone the  rest of the time.  Yeah, it's definitely set the precedent.  That was fucking hilarious.  And then I kept coming back to the room hoping he'd reenact it.  Very hot.  See these comics?  They get wacky.  Mudvayne?  Something had been in there, though, right?  Was that...  Something had been in there.  You could tell, right?  Yeah, it's not the first time you've been in that place.  Yeah, something had been in there.  Oh, no.  Something had been in there.  Diddling yourself. 
[03:31:00]  I can't get shit.  Hey, why don't you tell Mudvayne who you're now living with, Jay?  What?  Aren't you on your own show?  Didn't you have been listening?  They didn't hear it.  See, we do not listen on the show.  We've made that perfectly clear.  But did you hear who Jay Moore is living with?  No, I have no idea.  Bob Sugar.  Who you live with there, Mr. Sugar?  He lives with Nicky Cox.  Oh, good God.  Really?  I swear to God, it's good.  I swear to God, you guys just said it.  No one...  They didn't hear it, though. 
[03:31:30]  No, maybe there were five people talking at the same time.  They were showing a picture of you...  Did you say it?  No one listens on this show, Jay.  You know that.  Someone did say it, though.  Oh, someone said it.  I'm all ears now.  But they're now hearing it for the first time.  Man, I've never met a movie star.  Hollywood actress Nicky Cox.  Yeah, this is fun.  I've never really talked to a movie star before.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, a real movie star.  It's a new plateau in my life, actually.  The movie is getting airbrushed out of the poster.  Let me explain.  How about that King's Rance and the posters out, and they airbrushed all the white people  out of the poster.  Oh. 
[03:32:00]  Did they really?  Wow.  Oh, Jay.  We went to the lawyers on that one.  We, too, thought it was really cool to meet a Hollywood star until, you know, he hangs  around a while, and then you realize he's just as sick as everyone else.  Yeah, he's naked in bed.  Posted.  He's posting in bed.  We've all seen his penis.  Posted up.  We've seen him do things with his penis.  Yeah.  You guys sound like a bunch of fun guys to hang out with.  We're really not making a good impression of fucking rock stars.  A bunch of homo stories.  Yeah, I know.  Remember the time you showed me your car? 
[03:32:30]  No, no, no, no.  And when we saw Jay's penis, it had something to do with a young lady, well, not too young,  named Chocolate.  Named Chocolate.  I was surprised by the fucking humor.  We saw, allegedly, because we're not really sure what we saw, we saw Jay bang a black hooker  from Harlem once.  Wow.  It was nice.  Live on our show.  I'm going to be going back to my bus to sit in my back lounge and read some Dostoevsky.  Yeah.  That's what I'll be doing this afternoon.  A little reading.  Yeah.  A nice way to wind down.  Sure.  Have an espresso and some Dostoevsky. 
[03:33:00]  You're not going to just break your ass cheeks and call someone in the room?  No, I don't think that's going to be happening.  What's that, Jay?  I heard when you guys were talking about certain people not coming on the show, and Anthony  and you guys, you're saying that these people were dead to you, and then I went on Wack  Bag and saw the pictures of the gravestones of certain, you know, like Brewer, Dice, Lewis  Black, Carlos Mancia, and Anthony said, I was driving with my buddies, and Anthony says,  Jay fucking Moore.  That's right, Jay fucking Moore. 
[03:33:30]  And everyone tore me a new asshole.  I went back on the show, and everyone crushed me.  You know what is a credit to Jay?  Everyone was bashing Jay before he called and got back with the show.  After I called.  They were bashing me after I called.  Yeah.  Big Hollywood star.  But you turned it around.  That's how he stands with our show.  I love it.  He turned it around so quickly with, because he's a funny motherfucker.  That's just the way it is.  I love you, Jay.  Jay, did you feel your appearance was bad?  As opposed to... 
[03:34:00]  Jimmy, I've been waiting the entire phone call, wondering when he set me up.  I don't know.  Next thing I know, Jim Lennon says, was it bad?  You're Harvey Keitel.  It's all I think about.  I don't even want to fucking look at him anymore.  That's the reason I called.  Jimmy, the series must go shooting games.  I went to the park today, and I saw a day of struggling. 
[03:34:30]  And I looked him in his eyes, and he told me he's saving it for the big one.  Jackson, I'm obviously doing Harvey Keitel on the road.  Your kid doesn't shut up, does he, Jay?  Oh, my gosh.  Do that when I'm doing walking.  I don't even like doing walking anymore.  That is a talkative little kid.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  And he can take a punch.  All right.  Two things. 
[03:35:00]  I called to do waiting in vain to be set up for Keitel.  And I just called because I left the other day driving by myself,  just thinking of Anthony for no reason on the side, going,  no, man, I'm pretty fucking soft.  All right.  Any other questions for Mudvayne, Jay?  How about one?  Just one question.  How about a question they've never been asked before?  Because that's what we try to do on this show.  I don't think we were too successful. 
[03:35:30]  Have you ever?  How old are you guys?  Oh, shit.  There's a question.  Okay, that's it.  That's the only question.  Approaching 37 way too quickly.  Have you guys ever, when you were kids, out of curiosity, blown another kid?  Blown another kid?  Good question.  Well, you didn't specify male or female, so I'm not going to say.  But that gives me the...  Blown?  No, no, no.  But that gives me a window to say, yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[03:36:00]  Put that up on Wackbag.  Oh, by the way, everyone, it's Freak 8.  There's your show mentioned.  Stop posting.  It's Freak 8.  And more pictures of me and Cox fucking as monkeys.  Nice.  Yeah, very good.  Hey, Jay, I'll be happy to answer your question, and I'll even break it down by ethnicity.  Jim, boys blow each other every day.  They're monster reigns.  They want to put a good reward.  I'm a Catholic.  I'm blessed.  The Keitel, you were off today.  I'll make it up to you, Jimmy. 
[03:36:30]  What's that, buddy?  The Keitel's a little off this morning.  I'll make it up to you.  No, it sounds great.  You're talking about it.  It sounds exactly like Keitel.  You love the Keitel.  Stop.  He was shot in the gut.  It's my fault.  He was shot in the gut.  Reservoir Dogs.  Yeah.  Nice.  Good call.  I love you, boys.  All right, Jay.  Love you, Jay.  Our true friend of the show.  Ask me if I'm okay.  You okay?  Nah, man.  I'm pretty fucking far from okay. 
[03:37:00]  Punching up, boys.  Later, Jay.  See ya.  Jay Moore calling from Hollywood.  That guy's awesome.  This kid in the background.  You want to explain Monster Rain to these guys before we let him go, or no?  He's calling from Hollywood?  Oh, yeah.  This is satellite radio.  We're everywhere.  Jesus Christ.  What time is it there?  I was going to say.  Why is he even awake?  He's got the kid.  Kid now.  What a nightmare.  It has to be.  She is a fucking hot.  Which one?  You go with Aguilera.  You go with Aguilera?  Aguilera.  Absolutely. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  On the wall.  Dude, that is the hottest picture, dude.  Yeah, like I'm realizing I'm surrounded by naked women.  Yeah, well.  Look at that.  We got to keep morale up in here.  She is really just uber hot.  I was more of a fan of Britney Spears until she was.  No.  Fuck that.  Christina blew away Britney from beginning to end.  Dude, she's skinny.  She's like.  I know.  She's a little fidget.  Yeah, like four foot three or something.  I love it.  A fidget?  A fidget.  Ooh, a fidget.  I like that.  Is that a spinner?  No, that's what they call them in The Little Rascals. 
[03:38:00]  I don't believe in that fidget.  The Little Rascals.  We call them spinners.  Spinners?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get them up there and spin them.  Yeah.  Jessica Simpson, yes or no?  No.  No?  I'm out.  The new video, though?  I'm out.  She looks great.  The new video?  I don't care.  I know she's dumb and don't care.  Nope.  I'm not a big fan of her.  Really?  Nope.  Not at all.  Washing the car?  Nope.  I don't know what it is.  Nope.  Out.  Out.  Out.  I was with you until I saw the new video.  Yeah.  What about Dukes of Hazzard?  Is she going to?  She looks very hot in that.  How's she going to do that?  Well, the Daisy Dukes, where the name came from, yeah. 
[03:38:30]  She's wearing those little hide-up shirts.  Have you seen the video?  No, I haven't seen it.  That's why.  When you see this video.  Out faint.  Oh, my God.  Hot, man.  I think I've seen it.  Well, we should let these guys go.  I think we had fun here.  Gentlemen.  I think Matt started off like, ugh.  No, I didn't start off like, ugh.  I just sat down and just did my thing.  He didn't have his coffee yet.  He didn't have his coffee yet.  No, it's not good.  But I think we all got along.  The whole planet sucked until he had his Starbucks.  But now he's okay.  So you guys playing Ozzfest?  PNC tomorrow and Wednesday. 
[03:39:00]  That's right.  Two days tomorrow.  Two days tomorrow.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, yeah.  Absolutely.  Will you acknowledge him if you see him backstage?  Absolutely.  You will.  Wave.  Yeah.  He will be back there.  Hey, you know what?  There is a certain job description I have.  It doesn't mean I have to be friends with just anyone.  You better sign up for that.  I do love that about radio because there's so many times, you know, we'll have a really good  interview with a band or something.  Then we go to the show and we're backstage like, ugh.  Now we're all friends.  And zip right by like they don't even know you.  Security, have them removed. 
[03:39:30]  It's like, but what happened?  On our show, we were all, we were just pals.  But the worst is when you realize they did recognize you and just didn't give a fuck.  Yeah.  They didn't remember me.  Hey, remember we talked?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I know.  Ugh.  Fuck.  Just keep walking on.  The big blow off.  Right.  Some happy surprise.  I thought we were going to go off with me.  I thought we were going to go off with a tour boss and drink and drug and re-bought together.  This is one of the nicest smelling microphone.  Yeah, it is actually.  That's because that's the one that's never used by anybody.  Yeah, both of them.  It's frightening me that it smells so good. 
[03:40:00]  Really?  Because you guys.  It's spritzed.  It's been spritzed.  We're breezing it all the time.  We don't let other people use this video.  Lysol, disinfectant, Febreze.  Jimmy's you wouldn't want to use or Opie's you wouldn't want to use.  We gas it to him.  Because he, yeah, if Jimmy gets a good fart rolling, he'll shove his ass right against  it and just let it rip.  Only my mic.  Nobody else.  Did you ever do the cup and toss?  Oh, God, yeah.  The cup and toss?  Yeah, he does that.  Dude, we saw somebody, we saw a dude with his kids in a pickup truck.  We were driving along and straight up looked over and this dude cupped and tossed right  there in the front seat driving with his kids.  I'm like, what is he? 
[03:40:30]  And he just tossed it right in his face.  I'm like, that dude cupped a fart.  You got to hold it for a second and you just open it like it's a gift right in his face.  Let it slowly waffled into their face.  No, he tossed it in his own face.  He cupped and tossed.  Oh, in his own face.  Yeah, he cupped and tossed straight up.  Selfish.  Nice and sharing.  Selfish.  You guys, let's wrap up so we can play your single as we end the show.  We're going to do it for you guys.  So it's Mudvayne, Ozfest tomorrow and Wednesday in Jersey.  Jimmy's going.  And on before Maiden and then Sabbath.  The new CD's Lost and Found.  What are we hearing today? 
[03:41:00]  He points to Lost and Found.  What's the single?  Forget to Remember.  Forget to Remember.  I think that's where we're going to play.  I want to thank Matt and Chad for stopping by today, guys.  Thank you for having us.  Here's Mudvayne.  Check it out.  What have I done? 
[03:41:30]  Where have I come from?  When I brought the facts with the soap through a glass that I feel, the loss has become me.  Feeling undone.  What have I become?  When I turned my back on you, I turned my back on myself and became this machine. 
[03:42:00]  Solicit, selfishness, hopelessness, hopelessness, erroneousness.  A fear that's on the inside, twisting and distorting.  Memory has shaped me once again.  Still feel you on the inside, fighting through and stinging.  Will I ever forget to remember? 
[03:42:30]  Shadows in the sun, built up through us.  Still must have the demons that arrested me as a child, confession, rejection.  We grow up to give up.  People stumble and cracks, bones all fade back through the works of surrender.  Emptiness, loneliness, hopelessness, hopelessness, hopelessness. 
[03:43:00]  Feel it's on the inside, lifting and distorting.  Memory has shaped me once again.  Still feel you on the inside, fighting through and stinging.  Will I ever fall, can't you remember?  Or can you save me from myself? 
[03:43:30]  From these memories?  Or can you save me from myself?  From these memories?  Surrender to the dead of watching inside, leading to you.  Surrender to the secrets inside.  Life will be now.  Feel it's on the inside, twisting and distorting. 
[03:44:00]  Memory has shaped me once again.  Still feel you on the inside, fighting through and stinging.  Will I ever fall, can't you remember?  Can't feel you on the inside, fighting through and stinging.  You're going to be in the show.  That's it, I'm out of here. </pre>
