<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The July 18th, 2011, Opie and Anthony Show, hosted by Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, began with a scathing critique of Khloe Kardashian's tweet expressing relief at Lamar Odom's survival after a limousine accident that injured a motorcyclist and pedestrian.  The hosts vehemently criticized her apparent lack of concern for the victims.  They further fueled speculation about Khloe's paternity, citing perceived physical differences between her and her siblings, using photographs as evidence.  This transitioned into showcasing TMZ clips: one of Jim Florentine telling crude jokes and another of skateboarder Chad Muska using racial slurs, followed by an analysis of Muska's apologetic video, deemed insincere by the hosts.  A humorous segment ensued about the hosts' breakfast cereal preferences, focusing on their difficulties obtaining Count Chocula in Manhattan, and a discussion of various cereals like Apple Jacks, Fruity Pebbles, and Cocoa Pebbles.  The cereal discussion was interrupted by the playing of a melancholic piano piece frequently used in somber commercials, met with intense dislike from Anthony and further commentary from the hosts and listeners.

The show then shifted to a discussion about relaxing music, sparked by YouTube videos.  Initially criticizing piano music, they contrasted it with their preference for ragtime, and then veered into commentary on "Hearts of Space" and offensive jokes about various musical styles, including Muslim Arab music. This segued into discussions of sleep habits, hangovers, and the British Open, specifically Darren Clarke's win and a humorous anecdote about Clarke surviving a bar bombing.  This transitioned into a vulgar discussion about subliminal messaging in cereal box designs, featuring explicit commentary about women's bodies and sexual acts.

A lengthy, vulgar discussion followed about the World Cup, focusing on the physical appearance of female soccer players, with extensive objectification and crude jokes.  This extended to off-color comments on the physical attributes of various female celebrities like Tina Turner, Janis Joplin, and Aretha Franklin.  A CeeLo Green music video further fueled explicit commentary on women's attractiveness, interwoven with personal anecdotes about sexual experiences and preferences.  This portion of the show contained heavily sexually explicit and offensive conversations about the physical attributes of women, particularly Black women and transgender individuals, featuring derogatory and demeaning language directed at celebrities including Serena Williams, Billie Jean King, Renee Richards, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga.  The hosts rated their attractiveness based on race and body type, using crude and vulgar terms.  They also engaged in sexually graphic comparisons of male and female bodies, inventing slang terms for sexual acts and bodily fluids.  A running gag involved a caller named Bobo who claimed to have been in the studio the previous Friday, despite the hosts' denials, leading to a protracted, absurd argument.  Lady Gaga's music was analyzed, and a debate ensued on its originality, interwoven with commentary on her appearance and persona.  Jimmy expressed a strong desire to obtain a photograph with Lady Gaga, who was in the building for an interview.

The show then focused on the anticipation and aftermath of Jimmy's attempt to get a photo with Lady Gaga. While waiting, the hosts discussed various unrelated topics, including a humorous anecdote about a Detroit power outage highlighting perceived racial disparities, Opie's childhood, Jay Moore's airport security struggles, Moore’s call in promoting his podcast, their Led Zeppelin preferences, Starbucks baristas, and the Women's World Cup.  Much speculation surrounded the Lady Gaga photo opportunity, with bets placed on Jimmy's success.  They monitored the situation with an "undercover operative".  Jimmy's attempt was described, but the exact outcome remained ambiguous.

The final segment centered on Jim Norton's experience trying to get a Lady Gaga photo. Only three photos were officially taken due to strict photography policies. Norton expressed frustration and anger (with profanity) about the situation, describing his interactions with Lady Gaga, his attempts to get a high-resolution copy from the in-house photographer ("Roland"), and his self-deprecating commentary on his fanboy behavior.  The segment included brief discussions about other celebrities, upcoming appearances (Jim's show in Utah, potential appearances by Emmett Smith and Justin Timberlake), and humorous moments driven by Norton's exaggerated frustration.  The hosts planned to obtain the high-resolution image and discussed plans for an upcoming break and after-show.

[00:03:30]  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, certainly not the most listened  to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  By the way.  Good morning.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, July 18th, Monday, 2011.  What?  It's the future.  The future.  Happened.  2011.  I like your...  Spaceships out there?  I like your Khloe take.  Oh, the old Khloe Kardashian.  You do the same thing I do.  You listen to 10-10 wins on the way in.  10-10 wins coming in, and man, if you look, she tweeted because I guess her hubby, what 
[00:04:30]  the hell's his name?  Lamar Odoms.  Lamar Odoms.  Who plays for the Lakers.  Yeah, he was in a limo in his old town, his old homey town there.  Where is that?  Somewhere in Queens.  Jamaica, Queens, somewhere.  He was going to the barbershop.  He was going to the barbershop.  He was going back to the neighborhood?  Yeah, back to the hood, to the barbershop to get a haircut.  In a limo?  In a limo to piss off everyone?  In a fucking limo to, you know, keep it real. 
[00:05:00]  He was keeping it real.  When I go back to my hometown of Centipore, Long Island, I play it down a little bit.  Keep it on the DL?  Oh, fuck yeah.  You don't come strolling in in a limousine?  No, of course not.  Well, he was kicking it old school back in the hood to the barbershop.  The barbershop.  In a barbershop, and he's in his limo.  And his limo driver, I guess, struck a guy on a motorcycle and a pedestrian.  And most people are hurt pretty badly, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Hurt pretty bad.  Not him.  You know.  He's in a fucking limo.  Yeah, what's going to happen to him in a limo?  What's going to happen?  Right.  So, um, Khloe Kardashian gets the news and, uh, uh, finds out he's fine and tweets, angels  are surrounding me always.  Thank you!  Exclamation point!  Exclamation point!  Exclamation point!  Exclamation point!  That's got to be a lot of angels to surround her completely.  A lot of, yeah, yeah.  She is the chubby one.  Oh, boy, is she.  Uh, and all I could think of was, this, this bitch? 
[00:06:00]  What about the two guys laying in their own blood in the street, hit by a limo?  That weren't in a limo when they got hit.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, fuck you.  Fuck you and your dumb angels.  Right.  They don't surround you.  Uh, meanwhile, our husbands are there, you know, going, what was that, a speed bump?  What did we hit?  Did we hit any?  Was that a pothole?  They ought to fill these potholes in this city.  He probably spilled his 7-up a little bit on his pants.  Spilled his 7-up, maybe.  Damn, I gotta change my pants now before I go to the Borbers shop. 
[00:06:30]  I'm going to a Borbers shop to see my old boys, and now I got a stain on my pants?  God damn driver.  On my tracksuit.  On my tracksuit driver.  Come on.  Step on.  Come on.  And, and, and, yeah.  As two people are in the road broken.  Two people in serious condition, busted, laying there groaning in their own blood, and she's  happy that angels are surrounding her because her hubby was okay in the limo that hit, you  know, a guy on a motorcycle and a car, and a pedestrian. 
[00:07:00]  What happened to Lamar?  Anything?  Not a thing.  I don't even think he knew what happened.  Oh, God.  He's just like, I don't know.  He probably went and got a fucking, you know, well, got some of the fade on the side.  He got the slow fade cut.  These stupid Kardashians.  Enough already.  Oh, man.  Enough already.  They're obsessed with him.  I'm obsessed with him.  I'm obsessed with him.  News.  And a lot of people are obsessed with him because they watch that damn show.  Oh, that's the official.  It does millions every week.  What?  The official statement.  What happened to Lamar?  Lamar is, quote, shaken up but uninjured. 
[00:07:30]  Why is he shaken up?  Well, when a car hits things, it shakes a little bit.  Oh.  So he was probably literally, like, physically shaken up.  And I was like, what the hell was that?  Oh, that was the guy's head we just ran over.  Well, thank God the angels are surrounding him.  And nothing happened to him.  Maybe he thought it was some of the locals trying to take the tires and realize, oh, okay,  we just hit a pedestrian and a guy in a motorcycle or the motorcycle hit us.  Maybe I should go to a different neighborhood to get my Herc did. 
[00:08:00]  Any other Berber shops in this area?  Where's the Berber shop?  Berber shop.  Get out the core.  Get out the motherfucking core.  And if we're going to mention Khloe Kardashian, I got to say it again.  Who is her father?  Why isn't TMZ on this story, Sam?  You know a bit about pop culture.  Yeah, I don't know because she doesn't look anything like it.  She's a monster compared to her two sisters.  And the brother.  The brother looks like Robert Kardashian.  The two sisters, Kim and Kourtney, look like Robert Kardashian.  Right, they have more of that olive skin. 
[00:08:30]  Yes.  A little darker.  She doesn't look anything like any of them.  Her skin is lighter and she's a monster.  She's about a foot taller than them, it looks like.  She probably looks more like the twins or the younger ones.  And those are Bruce Jenner's daughters.  Yeah.  Okay, so Lamar was shaken up by the crash.  He quickly returned to work, tweeting on Friday,  shooting a Nike commercial in New York City.  Boy.  These motherfuckers are going to be,  these motherfuckers, he's shooting a Nike commercial running,  Nikes, and then there's a few months later, 
[00:09:00]  the two guys that the limo hit on that rail just trying to walk.  Yeah.  In those big fucking therapeutic shoes.  Well, that's because of the angels.  The angels.  Thank God the angels are surrounding her.  Yeah, surrounding her.  Not him, by the way.  Wouldn't the angels surround him and the limo?  It's all about her life.  Of course.  It's about her.  I know.  Totally self-centered.  And she's got a different father, in my honest opinion,  but no one wants to talk about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Here, show a picture of the three.  Is there one that has all three of them? 
[00:09:30]  You tell me that these three have the same parents.  She looks like China.  My three whores.  She looks like China, and the other two are beautiful.  I mean, you've got to give it to Kim and Courtney.  They're beautiful women.  And there is a resemblance between the two.  Right.  Not the case with Chloe.  No.  Chloe, so you think it may be a little different dick dipping going on for Chloe?  Is there a better picture of that?  She has fat knees.  I don't like her double knees. 
[00:10:00]  There's fat over her knees, like, pouring down onto them.  Here's the second picture, Ed.  Oh, look at that.  Look, she's a monster.  Wow, she's a gargantua.  She's a monster compared to the other two.  The other two look very similar.  And she's got a big Bruce Jenner head.  Yeah.  And Bruce Jenner's athletic body.  Yeah.  But she's not plumping it up.  She is plumping it up.  Boy, she liked that, though.  What do you think?  She liked some of that.  Is that what's going on?  That's right.  She got that fat hair. 
[00:10:30]  She don't look like the other two, right?  No, not at all.  No.  And the other two look very similar.  Mm-hmm.  I like that.  But no one talks about this for some reason.  Has there been rumors at all in Hollywood?  Not really.  And the brother looks like the other two sisters.  Not like Chloe.  Right.  Is it some deep, dark family secret they don't want out there?  Oh, cool.  Look at the one.  Deep, dark secrets you don't want out there.  It's a deep, dark secret they want out there.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  She's 18 feet tall. 
[00:11:00]  They're all wearing heels, so it's not the heels.  Why isn't anyone talking about this?  There's no way they got the same parents.  No way.  What do you think, man?  You came from my loins.  How tall is she?  She's about, I don't know.  Well, the other two are very, they're very short.  Deceivingly short.  Really?  What are they, like 5'2", 5'3"?  Yeah, yeah.  Like midgets.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're like midgets.  It's probably about 5'8", 5'9".  Probably.  5'9", I would say.  She looks like she's 6'3", in that picture.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Crazy.  Yeah, go to another one. 
[00:11:30]  There was one more in the...  Yeah, the one right next to the one you just popped up.  No, no, no.  Two over.  No, one more over.  One more over to the right.  My right.  Right there, yeah.  Ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  I'm here with my sisters, Lily.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Where are the colored gentlemen?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[00:12:00]  God damn, she's a brute.  They got this keeping up with the Kardashians.  They should start talking about who her father is. 
[00:12:30]  Fred Gwynn, apparently.  She just leaves her fucking silhouette in the door when she leaves in the morning.  I'm late.  I won't, I won't, I won't.  And the other thing, she's got personality, and the other two are as boring as watching Pink Trout.  Are they?  She does have personality, really?  Yeah, she really does.  I'll give it to her.  Just look at her face.  Her facial structure is completely different from the other two.  She has a big, like, around her face.  The other girls have those heart-shaped, thinner chin things going on. 
[00:13:00]  Let's get this started.  How do we get this started?  I'm saying today that I think Khloe Kardashian has a different dad, and it might be Bruce Jenner.  And maybe if you tweet her and ask her who her real father is, she'll tweet you back, and then we'll get the whole thing started.  Nice.  I like how you think.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  I like how you think.  She's going to tweet right back.  By the way, someone writes, it's Sean in North Carolina.  Sean in NC, he writes, so I guess Eric is surrounded by angel food cake. 
[00:13:30]  Oh.  Oh, God.  Because Khloe's surrounded by angels, and Eric is surrounded by angel food cake.  If you text Khloe that, you know she's going to be like, all right, the jig's up.  Oh, of course.  And then she'll make breakfast.  And lots of it.  Can we see one more?  I mean, come on. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, look at her.  I mean, come on.  Come on.  That's ridiculous.  She is way bigger than the other two.  And way taller.  And whiter.  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit.  And a face like China.  Yeah.  So it's nothing like their sister's.  Or brother.  Right.  No.  Speaking of.  And then that damn mom gets facelifts.  She can't even fucking close her eyes at this point.  Her friggin' skin is paper thin.  Here. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Blow that up.  She's got the.  She had so many facelifts that it has that weird cheek smile like that.  I don't even know how to describe it.  Like, a lot of women in Hollywood have that weird cheek smile.  Yeah.  Because I guess when you get all that face work done, you're actually, you look good as long as you're not smiling.  But you can't help but smile.  Right.  Because the skin's pulled back.  Right.  And the muscles don't move properly, I think.  I think they move as one unit.  Those two daughters are.  They're fucking smoking.  Of course they are.  Very, very hot.  Yeah.  They're boring as all hell, though. 
[00:15:00]  Gotta give it to them.  Jesus.  The mother is all lower face.  The top.  It looks like her fucking face was compressed.  Like, the top half is tiny with those little eyes.  Yeah.  What a big lower half of the face she has.  You know what, though?  I'm going to give that she does look like the daughter.  What?  The big bruiser daughter in the face.  Right.  Even though she's got work done.  Right.  Like, she's the same height.  Right.  As the daughter.  Right.  Chloe.  Right.  Yeah, but it has to be a different father.  Different dad.  It has to be a different dad.  Yeah.  In my honest opinion. 
[00:15:30]  That has no Robert Kardashian in it.  None.  I'm not seeing that.  Nope.  I was going to say TMZ.  Talking about that, you know.  Yeah.  Uh, I guess, uh, Florentine was on that.  What?  Did you see it?  Yeah.  They caught Florentine and talked to him.  And it's probably one of the best things I've ever seen on TMZ.  Because usually celebrities are trying to be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's cool.  Jim just walks right up and just starts talking about things.  And it's like some of the most politically incorrect shit. 
[00:16:00]  And it was fun.  But it was hilarious.  But how did he get on TMZ with that?  I don't know.  Somebody, like, came up with a camera and went, hey, Jim Florentine.  Where was he?  Uh, in Hollywood?  Coming out of one of those fancy restaurants?  I don't even know.  That's not Florentine's thing.  I don't even know.  But it was funny because it's like, he's not that Hollywood asshole that they always get on video.  He's just a regular guy.  So he just steps right up to the camera and just starts going off.  I'll give you a few things.  And he was very funny, man.  He was really funny.  Let's check that out.  He actually had the people at TMZ really laughing. 
[00:16:30]  I don't know where it is.  He had tweeted it, if you want to find it that way.  Yeah, you'll be able to find it that way.  But I just saw it and I retweeted it.  And then we'll play the other clip from TMZ.  The Pro Scater, using the N-word, a lot.  N-bombs, a fly-in.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  But we'll do the Florentine thing first.  Here's Florentine's TMZ clip.  Oh, here he is.  How you doing, man?  TMZ, dude?  I should have worn a clean T-shirt.  Look at this.  We got Jim Florentine in New York.  He's been on the Stern Show a bunch of times and he hosts that metal show. 
[00:17:00]  So we asked who is a rock star that he would love to party with today.  Well, I don't know if he's a rock star, but Nicholas Cage's son, Weston Cage.  Weston Cage, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  He's like...  First of all, I love Nick Cage.  He's an animal.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So his son is, too, and I've been keeping up on him and his drama with his wife and stuff  like that.  It's just...  They're just a complete mess, and I love that.  His wife is super hot.  Second of all, she's even more hot because she's drinking while she's pregnant.  He's like, you know, it's a big myth. 
[00:17:30]  He's like, it's a big myth that you can't drink while you're pregnant.  He's like, what are people afraid of?  What?  You think the kid's going to get drunk and wander out of your vagina in the middle of a row?  You know what I mean?  He's got a cord on.  He can't go that far.  He's going to be okay.  Yeah.  That's horrible.  Yeah, it is horrible.  Horribly funny.  All right, man.  Take care, bro.  That's awesome.  That's great.  That's horrible as I sip out of my straw.  Horrible.  Shut up.  Yeah, I thought that was really funny. 
[00:18:00]  He's going to crawl out of a vagina.  He's on television, for fuck's sake.  Really?  Jim don't care.  Is it television?  I know.  Really?  Really?  Really, is it?  I thought that was really funny, though, man.  We got famous pro skater Chad Muska.  I don't know this guy.  I'm not going to front, but he gets drunk and does graffiti, and the black security guards  stop him, and then he lets some N-bombs fly.  Oh, boy.  So he's drunk and doing his thing. 
[00:18:30]  Drunk and yelling the N-word?  That sounds like Saturday night, doesn't it?  I was going to fight as soon as you hit him.  I was going to fight myself.  These motherfuckers right here with their little white uniform, gold badge, black uniform,  gold badge, all that bullshit.  Niggas is fake right there.  Honkies is real right here.  Fuck.  Fuck all these niggas right here.  Oh, boy. 
[00:19:00]  He sounds like one of those wannabe white guys, though.  He doesn't sound like he's being a racist.  Yeah, yeah.  He sounds like he's trying to be like, yo, yeah, yeah.  Honky.  By the way, this was censored by TMZ.  TMZ, yes.  Oh, they censored the profanity, right?  Yeah.  What are we waiting for?  Are we waiting for the cops to come?  Are the cops coming, or what's going on with you?  What?  Did you guys call the cops?  Niggas, like, niggas, like, honking shit.  No, I will, I will, let me, let me, let me, let me tell you something. 
[00:19:30]  Like, I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care what you think, but I'm going to tell you.  Like, that niggas shit, like, I've been around with the homie shit.  It's the same shit.  It means nothing to me.  Because you don't know me.  And I'm not racist ever.  Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  That's the homie shit.  It's the same fucking shit.  What?  Fuck y'all niggas, man.  Fuck y'all niggas fucking arrest me.  You know, when you say you're not racist, you're probably really racist. 
[00:20:00]  Probably racist.  Just about every person is racist.  Once you have to say it.  Huh?  Once you have to say it.  Yeah.  Yeah, probably.  Seth in Illinois writes, Chad Muska has been known as a wigger for years.  He's got rap albums.  He calls his skateboard.  Are you ready for this?  The Chadillac Muscalade.  Oh, no, he doesn't.  Yuck.  Douchebags.  Skaters are douchebags.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You want to hear his apology?  Of course he should want.  A doodle.  Went on YouTube and did his thing. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, what's up?  This is Chad Muska.  Hey, wow.  Hey, what's up?  Suddenly, I noticed a different tone in his voice.  Oh, hoof.  None of that wigger shit anymore, huh?  Wow.  Wow, was I an awful little...  Hey, what's up?  This is Chad Muska.  It's kind of a difficult situation.  Kind of a tough place to start.  A lot of you saw a video of me the other day on TMZ.  It wasn't me.  No, I can't listen.  I'd be like, it wasn't me. 
[00:21:00]  It wasn't me.  Can we not play this?  I got to hear this.  This is a little moving.  Bullshit.  But I got to hear it.  It's very moving.  Yeah, I got to hear the bullshit.  You meant everything you said.  Oh, I know.  Just fucking stand behind it, man.  TMZ, where I came across as a complete drunk idiot.  And I can agree I was one at that moment.  I don't remember courting this Sunday.  A lot of stupid decisions were made that night.  And a lot of things have come out of it.  The one thing that is sticking with me the most and something that... 
[00:21:30]  Sorry.  Sorry.  Can we go back a second?  Supposedly, there's a picture of Chloe.  This is Scott English.  And Frankenberry next to each other.  Can I see that?  Really?  Can I see that?  I'm sorry.  Chloe and Frankenberry?  I'm sorry.  Usually...  Separated at birth?  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah, there's a... 
[00:22:00]  Oh, that's great.  Come on.  Frankenberry have that little toot-toot steam horn on the side of his head and a steam gauge.  I don't know.  He's got like a steam pressure gauge and a toot-toot, like, you know, blow the whistle when the work day is over.  Frankenberry stunk.  Speaking of horrible cereal...  Count Chocula was the shit.  Some asshole goes, hey, Captain Crunch or Lucky Charms? 
[00:22:30]  What the fuck is wrong with people?  Who the fuck would pick Lucky Charms over Captain Crunch?  Well, what year is this?  Let me think.  And then they're like, well, yeah, but Captain Crunch cuts the top of your mouth.  It really does.  You've got to wait for it to really soak that milk up.  That's a timing issue, because then if there's too much milk, then it's a soggy mess.  Soggy.  Count Chocula is better than all of them.  Lucky Charms sucks.  I like Lucky Charms occasionally.  Get the fuck out of here.  Nice little tasty marshmallows? 
[00:23:00]  Apple Jacks.  If it was all marshmallows, I would be in.  Apple Jacks.  Right?  Right, Sam?  Yes, Apple Jacks.  You know what?  I like Apple Jacks.  I'm feeling Apple Jacks.  You know what?  Let's get some Apple Jacks right the fuck now.  How did we go from fucking Kentucky Fried Chicken the other day to Apple Jacks?  But let's get some Apple Jacks.  Let's do it.  How about we get a bunch of cereals we all like?  A variety pack where you're only left with Special K in the cabinet.  They always put one not sweet cereal.  Yeah, yeah.  They put one or two pieces of shit cereal in there. 
[00:23:30]  It's like, oh, this is great.  Snack pack.  What do we want?  We got Apple Jacks, definitely.  What do you want, Jimmy?  Count Chocula?  Count Chocula.  I haven't had it in years.  Let's get one of those.  Do they still make those variety packs where you can eat the cereal out of the box?  I used to love it.  Remember, you used to dissect it.  You used to put a fucking, like a coroner's autopsy incision in the top of the box, and  you'd fold the thing over, and it was foil.  Like, it was foil that it was in, so it would fold the milk. 
[00:24:00]  It was heavy, uh...  Heavy, like, paper?  Like, wax paper?  Wax paper, thank you.  And then they went to something else where it would start leaking through after, like,  five minutes.  You had to eat it real quick.  Oh, that was the shit, though.  That was the old days.  It was even perforated.  Right.  And you had to cut it.  Incisions made.  Yeah.  Let me open this up.  Oh, yeah, we got cereal in here.  I don't want Captain Crunch today, though.  Okay.  I want something with, like, some yoga broads on the box.  What?  Like, Kashi?  I'm kidding.  I know.  Yoga broads on the box. 
[00:24:30]  If a cartoon character's not on the box, that cereal could go fuck itself.  I don't know if you guys are fans of Cookie Crisp or not, but...  Cookie Crisp!  I remember Cookie Crisp.  Yeah, yeah.  No, we got Count Chocola.  I like Frosted Flakes.  That covers the whole area.  You do?  Frosted Flakes is pretty good.  And people go, isn't that just, like, cornflakes with sugar on it?  It's like, sugar is...  That frosting, there's something else on there.  Frosting.  It's not just sugar, motherfucker.  I think our variety sucks here.  Apple Jacks, solid.  Count Chocola, solid.  Frosted Flakes. 
[00:25:00]  You're thinking Frosted Flakes doesn't make the cut?  I think we could do better.  I think we could do better.  Oh, how about peanut butter crunch?  Oh, anything with peanut butter can suck my...  You don't like peanut butter?  I've hated peanut butter ever since I was a young child.  I didn't know that.  Back in the 30s.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Ever since we got a dog.  Oh, wait a minute.  Look at the Jim Norton flow chart.  I hate peanut butter.  Molested.  Molested.  You were molested by a man with a monocle.  A monocle and a top hat. 
[00:25:30]  Yes.  You want to hear an adorable story about cereal?  Yeah.  When I was a boy, I had eaten a little bit of cereal, and I didn't want it anymore.  And then I poured the bowl with the milk in it back in the box because I didn't know you  I couldn't do that.  I was a sweet boy.  With the milk in his pocket.  Yes.  What a mess that must have been.  Yes.  What an idiot you are.  That was 35 years ago tomorrow.  Oh.  He remembers dates.  Happy birthday.  Very well. 
[00:26:00]  Yay.  Yes.  But you cry wolf all year long.  I don't know when the fuck your birthday is.  I know.  Is it tomorrow for real?  I've been looking for surprises all morning.  Oh.  Hoping that they're here a day early.  No.  How about...  It legitimately is Jimmy's birthday.  Yeah.  Now hear me out.  It's my birthday week.  It's your birthday week.  No, no.  It's your birthday tomorrow.  He gets a birthday week.  And maybe you'll get a cake and like it.  That's it.  And maybe a picture with Lady Gaga today for your birthday.  Oh. 
[00:26:30]  You never know.  The Gogs is coming up.  If you get a picture with Lady Gaga today, that was my present to you.  And if I don't, that was serious.  They fucked up another one.  You back yourself on there.  That's funny.  You got to have an open mind for our third cereal choice.  And keep in mind, too.  Hold on.  You guys picked.  You picked Apple Jacks.  Yeah.  Jimmy picked Count Chocolates.  I get to pick one.  Simple as that.  You also want to keep in mind that you can combine the cereals.  So maybe if you'd like to taste...  You can't do that. 
[00:27:00]  Apple Jacks, Count Chocolates.  Only a man boy like yourself would do that.  Exactly.  I am so against mixing.  Yeah.  We know that.  No.  Someone is saying, lean on me.  Yeah.  I remember the whole lean on me.  Oh, God.  Remember when you brought in the lean on me cereal with the box with the chick on it?  She was exercising.  They literally had twigs in the box.  That sucked.  I don't want anybody who votes for Ralph Nader on my cereal.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to hear some moans out there. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Come on.  Just go to the...  But before you give it, go to the early...  Remember your youth here.  I got a good one.  I really do.  It's my new favorite.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Fruity Pebbles.  All right.  For the win.  I'll give you Fruity Pebbles.  For the win.  I'll give you Fruity Pebbles.  Anything that...  Co-co-co-pebbles are better.  Anything that when you're done, the milk does not look like milk anymore.  Right.  It's like some kind of radioactive waste pumping into Japan's ocean.  Oh, boy.  Let's not talk about that.  Why? 
[00:28:00]  It's still happening over there.  They're still sad.  Are they?  I thought that news was over.  I guess the World Cup was supposed to wash that away.  Wash that away?  Wash it away.  Yeah, because the announcer said, you know, they had a tough year.  But the World Cup, you know, the Japanese winning that is...  Yeah, pretty resilient, those people.  It's good for that concept.  Amazing.  Fruity Pebbles.  Fruity Pebbles.  I cursed Dana White from the UFC because I didn't think of Fruity Pebbles in years.  And then he tweets that he puts it on his damn Pinkberry.  I started putting it on my damn Pinkberry shit.  Yeah.  And now I buy the fucking Fruity Pebbles. 
[00:28:30]  Good choice.  You like the Fruity Pebbles?  I love Fruity Pebbles.  Good choice.  Fruity Pebbles, yeah.  All right.  Let's get on this.  Who's buying our cereal?  See, an intern would be doing this.  What kind of milk do you use?  1%?  I'll use fat-free.  I don't have to.  I'll use skim milk, sure.  We got the 1%.  1%?  Yeah.  That's good.  I just put enough to, like, moisten it a little.  You don't like milk either?  I hate milk.  Jesus.  I fucking hate milk.  What's wrong with you?  You don't like milk and peanut butter?  Milk, peanut butter, and then the small... 
[00:29:00]  Enough.  Are you from the future?  I'm from the future.  I hate pianos.  What?  I despise the piano.  Unless it's being used in a band-type thing or something.  But these fucking commercials where it's like...  This somber piano's playing because some guy's talking about his cancer fucking treatment or something.  I hate the piano when it's just playing alone and somber. 
[00:29:30]  And cancer is rough.  You don't need to make it rougher with piano music.  Yeah, don't give me the fucking piano shit.  When it's being played in a band, an orchestra, something like that.  But I push the button so hard, I'm like, fucking hate pianos.  See?  It all ties in.  The flowchart is correct.  The milk, peanut butter, and piano, it all ties in the same thing.  Something was there.  When you were a lad, somebody said, now you have to put your tulips on my penis, and your butter do it good and get the milk in your mouth.  I didn't even think of that. 
[00:30:00]  You're right.  Wait a minute.  It's all word association.  Hate the piano.  So far, you don't like peanut butter, milk, and the piano.  And the piano.  I'm going to keep track of this.  Solo piano.  Solo piano.  Yeah.  I love piano.  And non-white.  Yeah, well, does that really have to be written?  Uh, the milk, peanut butter.  So you, you know, when you get some old school fucking, uh.  But you've never sat down and had a nice peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a big tall glass of cold milk?  Nah.  I had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches the other day. 
[00:30:30]  When I was, uh, uh, Saturday.  When I was broke off my ass and eating Triscuits, occasionally I would have peanut butter and jelly over a friend's house.  I can have that every day.  But I just ate it because I had to, or I would die of starvation.  Oh.  And I hated it.  They never have enough jelly on them.  But there's always an abundance of peanut butter.  Yes.  There's a way to do that properly.  And this little schmear of jelly.  You want to have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches today, too?  Oh, God, no.  We were so, we were so poor, though.  We had the, I know, I've said this a million times, the Pepperidge farm bread that we had to make our peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, that horrible stuff.  Where the jelly would soak through.  Those are like shingles.  And then every once in a while I would go to a friend's house and the mom would buy, ah, Wonder Bread.  Nice, soft Wonder Bread.  And I was in heaven.  Reach halfway through, get the great middle pieces.  And always wondered what I was doing wrong as a little boy that mommy wouldn't buy us Wonder Bread.  Yeah.  It was always just shitty, old Pepperidge farm bread.  It was your fault, Greggy.  I think it might be.  It was your little fault back then.  Vince from Bayonne, Pinkberry and Fruity Pebbles.  Sounds gay to me.  Yeah, that's pretty bad. 
[00:31:30]  I'm not going to lie to you, Vince.  It's pretty bad.  Pretty bad combo.  Oh.  Yeah.  What are we looking at?  Fruit Loops.  I do like the Fruit Loop.  Should we trade out Jimmy's cereal?  No.  I'm surrounded by Fruit Loops.  Jim loves chocolate cereals.  I really do.  I think we got it.  You said Coco Pebbles was better than Fruity Pebbles.  Oh, the Fruity Pebbles.  You like Count Chocula.  And you were molested.  I probably was.  You were molested.  By a fruit, so I don't like that or by, I was either molested by a fruity guy, so I 
[00:32:00]  don't like fruity stuff, or I was molested by a black guy, so I love the chocolate stuff.  Black guy with a cape.  We don't need to buy the peanut butter and jelly.  We'll do peanut butter and jelly another day.  Okay.  But I'm happy.  We got Apple Jacks, Count Chocula, and Fruity Pebbles.  Fruity Pebbles.  Perfect.  That's it.  Yes.  Travis.  I have some potential bad news about your cereal list.  Oh.  I was tipped off by Roland.  Why can't we buy anything?  We'll be insurance for the colors if we choke.  Hang on. 
[00:32:30]  How do we blame management for this?  Because I'm ready to rock with a rant.  Wait to hear what I have to say.  Roland said, no bad moods.  I'm good.  I'm good for now.  Standard Monday mood.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Yeah, but equally, we have the same mood on Mondays.  Yeah.  We'll see how it progresses from here.  Travis, go ahead.  So Roland says, oh, you can't buy Count Chocula in Manhattan.  And I said, what are you talking about?  Of course you can.  Of course you can.  They did a little internet search, and apparently everybody's complaining that you cannot buy 
[00:33:00]  Count Chocula in Manhattan.  No, why is that?  You just can't find it.  Wow.  It's in no stores.  That's got to be racism.  Bullshit.  So I would not get your hopes up about Count Chocula this morning.  I think it's political correctness instead of racism.  We need a substitute.  Yeah.  If not Count Chocula, then...  What does the Count Chocula box look like?  Let's get to the bottom of this Count Chocula conspiracy.  Let's see.  There's a chocolate vampire.  And then we'll go to the instrumental piano thing to piss off Anthony in a minute.  And then we'll go back to the skater kid, I guess.  See, I knew we could blow the skater kid off. 
[00:33:30]  Nah, nobody would say it.  Oh, man.  Look at him.  Is that new?  That's new.  That isn't the old school.  I don't like that.  No, what is that?  I don't like that.  Get the old school one up there.  That's frightening, man.  That is scary looking.  That's frightening.  They made him more 3D looking.  That's the old one.  That's the old one right there.  He's all happy.  He's around a bowl of cereal that he could live in.  His little pointy knees.  He has pointy knees.  He does have pointy knees.  Yeah.  And there's free gifts.  Monster stamps.  What's taking over Count Chocula? 
[00:34:00]  That's the question.  I don't know.  There's another cereal that's similar to that that the supermarkets would rather have on  their shelves.  Cummies.  Cummies.  What are the chocolate fruity pebbles called?  Cocoa pebbles.  I would bet cocoa pebbles.  I'll take cocoa pebbles.  Cocoa pebbles.  No, but that's too close to fruity pebbles.  No.  It's chocolate.  How did Roland know that?  I don't know.  You can't get Count Chocula.  Because it's food.  I know he's a food addict, but how did he know?  He said one day he went to 12 different stores trying to find Count Chocula. 
[00:34:30]  I couldn't find Count Chocula.  I just couldn't find him.  It's an ethyl.  There's all these drug beheadings.  Sacrifices drug beheadings to get a nice donut.  Yeah, I went to Juarez to get some Chamsasula.  Somebody reports there's plenty of Count Chocula in Queens.  Yeah, you have no problem finding it in the outer boroughs.  I'll bring it over for the show.  Oh, should we have him bring us some Count Chocula?  For the show.  I wouldn't eat anything he brought. 
[00:35:00]  I don't care if it was in a vault.  I ain't fucking eating shit that disgusting man brings over.  You wouldn't eat food he brought you?  No, with his pre-cum fingers.  Jesus.  Would you lick his fingers?  Oh, God.  I'd just suck in Bubba's fingers.  All right.  If I just smell like the bus handles and just smelly guy hands.  This person says you can find Count Chocula at Key Foods on 2nd Avenue.  That doesn't do us any good here.  That's pretty far. 
[00:35:30]  That's going to be too late.  Yeah, we don't have to go that far.  Yeah, we want Apple Jacks immediately.  I bet if you pop in a store, you get lucky.  I'm not saying Roland doesn't write here.  Someone go now because we'll do a few more minutes of radio and then we'll eat some delicious cereals.  And what's the substitute just in case there is no Count Chocula?  Cocoa Pebbles.  Cocoa Pebbles.  Yeah, something chocolatey, I would say.  You're right.  My cereal of choice is always going to be chocolatey.  Cookie Crisp.  Apple Jacks. 
[00:36:00]  What about Cookie Crisp?  Cocoa Crispies.  Cocoa Crispies.  Those are good.  If there was no choice, I would have some Cocoa Crispies.  I haven't eaten cereal in a long time.  Would you like Cocoa Crispies above Cocoa Pebbles?  No, I wouldn't.  No.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  But just assholes.  Okay.  Oh, Cocoa Puffs.  What's wrong with Cocoa Puffs?  No.  Cocoa Puffs.  I'd prefer not to.  Really?  No, I'd rather not.  You're Lutheran. 
[00:36:30]  You don't want to be cool for Cocoa Puffs?  You have to be Lutheran.  I'll eat Cocoa Puffs, but they're too hard.  They would always hurt the inside of my mouth because it was hard, crunchy.  Like, I would always get one fucking jamming my soft mouth palate.  You know what I do like, too?  What's that?  They used to be called Sugar Pops.  Now they just call them Pops.  Pops.  I got to have my Pops.  You just call them Pops?  Yeah.  Remember, everything was sugar before.  It was Sugar Frosted Flakes, Sugar Pops.  The other one with the bear, Super Sugar Crisp.  Now what is it?  Now they just call it... 
[00:37:00]  Crisp or whatever.  They cut the word sugar off of it.  How about Super Crisp?  Because people were like, oh, sugar, ah, it's bad.  But it's still the same shit.  They just take the word sugar off.  I think it's Honey Crisp now.  Ooh.  It's like Kentucky Fried Chicken.  It's rare that they call it Kentucky Fried Chicken.  It's always KFC.  That's right.  Because they, you know, fried is a bad word.  That's right.  All right, let's go.  But you're not fooling anyone.  I know there's sugar in that shit, motherfucker.  Definitely.  That's why it's sweet.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  Who's buying cereal today?  Yeah.  We'll figure that out.  Every time they take out sugar, they put heroin. 
[00:37:30]  They call them super heroin crisps.  And heroin snacks.  And Cheerios can suck a dick.  Who's allowed to have our cereal today?  A small dick.  Make the list?  Cheerios.  You want to make the list?  Who's allowed to have cereal today?  Because the Apple Jacks box is very small.  We are.  And I definitely want some of that shit.  You want some Apple Jacks.  And I want some Fruity Publis.  I'd like to say that Mars drew the gets nothing card for KFC that we never do.  So I would say Mars should not have cereal.  Or we should just apply it.  Perfect.  Mars doesn't get cereal.  And Troy, since he was only going to have sides, should only be able to have some milk. 
[00:38:00]  Okay, perfect.  Perfect.  That's fun.  You had to remember or be listening to our chicken break.  Right.  Perfect.  Right.  How about this?  After we are done eating our cereals, whatever's left you guys get.  Okay.  But you have to eat out of the bowls with the milk left.  You have to use the leftover milk.  Like cats.  You can't add milk.  You can't add milk.  No.  Whatever's left dripping out of our mouths off the spoon.  Yeah.  Holy God. 
[00:38:30]  I hate to smell the back of somebody's spoon after it's dried.  Yeah.  No.  That's disgusting.  You should smell my Starbucks lid.  No.  Is it bad?  When my food pocket is acting up.  Oh, God.  It's good today.  Yeah, mine's fine.  Sometimes it'll freak me out.  Like, what the fuck?  Is there anything worse than smelling your own breath out of a cup?  Oh, it's horrible.  Today I'm good.  So we'll go get some cereal.  Yes.  All right.  Those cereals.  Yeah, I got it on my pad.  Those cereals.  Do you like the smell of dried saliva? 
[00:39:00]  It's terrible.  No, it really is.  Who would like that?  It's just, all that's left is like bacteria.  Oh.  You want to go back to Chad or is it too late now for Chad's apology?  I forgot about Chad.  Let's see.  Do we care?  I want to hear the part where he says, I'm sorry.  All right.  And if he even acknowledges what he did or just kind of says.  All right, let's start the clip over.  I may have said something inappropriate.  He was sounding very wiggery and using the N-word when this security guy stopped him when  he was doing his graffiti, right? 
[00:39:30]  That's right.  And then he goes on YouTube and sounds extremely white.  Hey, what's up?  This is Chad Muska.  It's kind of a difficult situation, kind of a tough place to start.  A lot of you saw a video of me the other day on TMZ.  That's not me.  Where I came across as a complete drunk idiot and I can agree I was one at that moment.  At that moment.  And a lot of stupid decisions were made that night and a lot of things have come out of it. 
[00:40:00]  The one thing that is sticking with me the most and something that just really, really  hurts me deep inside is the fact that some people have assumed that I'm racist over some  of the derogatory slang that I was using during their rest.  In no way am I justifying what I said and saying it's right in any way.  I take full responsibility for my actions and... 
[00:40:30]  That's that full responsibility bullshit.  What does that mean?  I like breaking this shit down.  I take full responsibility.  Okay, so what does that mean?  Yeah, of course you do.  You got arrested.  You're fucking...  Right.  It's Zach Wild with AIDS.  But what does full responsibility mean to you?  Yeah, what does that even mean?  It's a catchphrase.  And I'm so, so sorry for offending anybody out there.  That's the last thing in the world that I want to do is offend anybody.  That's the last thing.  On any type of racial level because I pride myself in being an open-minded person to all 
[00:41:00]  races, to all financial backgrounds, to anything.  See, pause right there, please.  This is where he loses you.  It's like, shut up.  You don't have to go on for an hour and 45 minutes about how...  Just say, look, I said something really stupid.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said that.  It was dumb.  It's not the way I feel.  And then get on with it.  It's because in his racist head, he's justifying it to himself.  He's not even apologizing at this point.  He's like, oh God, I am a racist. 
[00:41:30]  I love throwing out the N-bomb.  Maybe I should elaborate on what I'm doing here.  Yeah, he could have left them alone.  I was drunk.  I said stupid things.  Yeah.  And that's not me.  I don't even remember.  Have a good day.  I was blacked out.  I don't even remember that crap.  I think people understand saying stupid shit when you're drunk.  It's like...  Thanks, Kenny.  But to keep going, it's another minute, almost two minutes to go here.  Wow.  I judge people based on my relationship with them, and I don't allow anything else to come  in between that.  Based people on how much light they absorb.  I can see where, in that video, somebody that didn't know me would watch that and come to 
[00:42:00]  a conclusion that I'm something that I'm not.  And even myself, watching that video, realized that it's not right to use certain slang like  that and to use words that can bring up hurt inside people and negative things, even if  it has been socially acceptable in the community that I'm surrounded in, it doesn't make it 
[00:42:30]  right.  And I just want to say that I am, from the bottom of my heart, completely, completely  sorry.  Wow.  Listen to this groveling douchebag.  Shut the fuck up.  Then you read the Daily News today about the fucking cops are not even sure to classify it  a hate crime.  The white guy that was beaten up on the train.  Oh, yeah.  And then other passengers just started joining in, beating the shit out of this kid, calling  him a cracker, and the cops aren't sure if it was a hate crime. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, we're not sure.  Yeah, right?  Could you just try once, one-on-one?  What are they saying it could be?  Because they haven't caught the people.  He said, first of all, the Daily News says he was a white kid.  They will not say the race of the assailants.  Of course they won't.  They will not say the race of the assailants, only that he was a white kid.  But this is what white people have turned into.  Like, I'm saying this guy shouldn't apologize, but that, where's, no one gives a shit about  that, and he says the word nigga, trying to be a bet, and he's fucking groveling.  I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. 
[00:43:30]  I'm so sorry.  Do you understand?  Most black people don't like you, Chad.  Yeah.  Do you get it?  Yeah.  Fuck.  We apologize, too.  They don't like you.  They don't look at you and think, hey, look at the white guy with the beard.  He's a cool guy.  He's great.  I'd love to hang with him.  If you're on the train, they'd beat the shit out of you.  Yeah.  Not one-on-one, either.  Not one of my actions, and sorry that I put myself out there like that and offended anybody  because, like I said, that's not me.  That's not the person I am.  It is you. 
[00:44:00]  I have love for everybody in this world.  Everybody?  No matter what.  Casey Anthony?  The only time I don't like somebody is if they do something negative against me, and I'm  extremely, extremely sorry, and for those of you that know me, I hope I didn't hurt you  in any way and you understand where I'm coming from, and for those of you that don't know  me, I hope someday that you get a chance to meet me and know the real person that I am,  and the video on TMZ is not a representation of that.  Yes, it is. 
[00:44:30]  I hope you understand.  That's a representation of a portion of who you are when you drink, maybe.  That's partly you.  I am not making any excuses for it.  Ah, you just did.  You made fucking 20 excuses.  I hope that society understands me and forgives me.  Society.  Because I got nothing but love for you.  All right.  You're groveling.  I got nothing but love for you.  Just say you're sorry and move on.  But that's why people, if you say the word nigger, your career is going to be ruined.  Oh, yeah.  Your life is going to be ruined.  You're going to be branded a racist forever.  Look out. 
[00:45:00]  And I'm not saying these guys on the train, these guys who assaulted this guy are entertainers  who have the same level of social standards, but it's just the way we look at it.  They will not even mention the race.  And I don't know if they're black or Spanish guys.  I really don't know.  Yeah, I don't know the story yet, really.  Well, the Daily News, I mean.  I could assume based on the M.O.  I did read a very good description of assailants, though, when it came to the guys, the fucking  guys that shot the brothers.  They mentioned the assailants, the white guys.  Right, right, right. 
[00:45:30]  But they don't mention the race of the victims.  But in this case, they mentioned the race of the victims.  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  It's amazing.  It's the only thing the cowards in the media feel safe saying.  Yep.  It's not about black people.  I'm not saying that white people don't commit the crimes or that black people don't go  to jail for the crimes.  I'm not saying that.  I'm only talking about the way the media reports it.  It's dishonest.  It's all I'm talking about is the media.  It's deceptive.  It's selective facts that they put out there.  They speculate on some stories. 
[00:46:00]  They comment on some stories.  They call people monsters.  But then the other way around, they won't even mention the race of a perpetrator, never  mind calling them monsters or savage or animal.  They keep those, all those words got to be kept away when a certain race is assaulting  another race.  The Fat Nick story where the three black guys went to Brooklyn to rob cars.  Yeah.  Nick was one of those guys like a rapper too.  He was one of those like, you know, who would say, yo, what's up, nigga?  He was one of those guys. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Him and two friends assaulted the guys with bats.  They were there to rob the place.  Yeah.  He's in jail for what, 10 years for that?  Yeah.  They haven't arrested these guys, but this is not, why is this not front page news?  Why does the media expect this of black people?  I don't understand why, or Spanish, whoever was, why is that expected of you?  It's just, it's the, and I hate saying liberal media, but that's what it is.  But why don't, I don't understand why black people don't, maybe they do get angry and we  just don't know that they get angry.  But there's never anything vocalized or verbalized about it that I hear. 
[00:47:00]  Because they don't want to perpetuate this stereotype.  It's like, well, you know what?  Then stop doing the crimes and they won't be reported at all.  But if you're going to do the crimes, let's see the whole fucking story.  Everything.  That story really bugged me.  We were, we were talking about cereals, fun cereals.  Yes, but Count Chocula actually got us talking about this.  You want to hear some piano?  Count Chocula.  Oh, I'm going to hear some piano. 
[00:47:30]  And I realized this.  This piano clip online has 7 million views.  Let me tell you something.  Yes.  I realized this today, but I've noticed for years, I get like physically, like my shoulders  go up and I have to, I can't hit the, see, because this is always accompanied with the  cancer centers of New Jersey want you to know that if you're suffering from melanoma,  but it's always some, little, yeah, little Veronica was living her normal life as a child 
[00:48:00]  when they found a tumor on her neck.  I hate pianos.  I hate pianos.  This is nice.  No, it's not.  It's depressing.  This is fucking depressing music.  Are you sad?  Why are you yelling?  No, it's, I, it's Monday.  I want to sleep.  How come you don't like being sad?  No, this is sad music.  If I go to hell, I'm going to go play in the piano. 
[00:48:30]  Remember, uh, Great Falls of Fire?  This, listen to this.  It's nice and relaxing.  No, it's depressing.  This makes me want to get jerked off.  My dick guitar when I hear this music.  Look at it.  Look at the ray, uh, light coming through the trees there.  If it's Jerry Lee Lewis piano, that's fine.  Where he's fucking playing it like a maniac.  But, but this shit.  Who played him?  Was that Randy Quaid?  I was feeling pretty good for the la la la la. 
[00:49:00]  That's what he used piano?  It almost sounds like.  I was feeling pretty good.  Good.  Good.  No, this is depressing drivel shit.  I hate this.  You don't like slowing it down ever, do you?  No, I do.  I do, believe me.  You do?  But not in this way.  Piano.  No.  Why don't you pick up your tootally doo?  Stop it.  You like this.  I'm not even going to tootally doo to this.  Why?  I refuse to tootally doo to this.  This just bothers you?  It bothers me.  Does the other thing get sad with this piano music? 
[00:49:30]  You don't like going to that sad place, do you?  No, it's not even that.  It's not sad.  It's not like tear-inducing.  It's this depressing.  Like, who would want to listen to this?  This is inspirational.  No, it's not.  It's just, it's ick.  Almost 8 billion views.  Who's watching this?  I want to push my ass up in the air.  Like, as those hands brush the back of my thighs.  And hopefully you get the knuckle into the asshole.  This is massage music, folks. 
[00:50:00]  I hate this.  All right.  Get it?  If there were even maybe vocals to it or a little drum track or just something.  Vocals ruin this type of music.  No, it does something.  It's just the single plinkety-plinkety keys.  I hate them.  Sound like little tears.  I hate this.  All right.  You all right?  14,000 likes and 270 dislikes. 
[00:50:30]  That's all from the same person who was sad.  Yeah.  What are some of the comments?  Give me one of the comments.  See?  All right.  Thank you.  What?  What?  Suddenly I feel like crying.  Life is so beautiful.  See?  To everyone who watched this video, enjoy life.  Life is one thing.  You live it once.  So cheer up, everyone. 
[00:51:00]  Cheer up!  Then don't listen to this!  So cheer up, everyone.  And be happy.  Don't worry about anything.  Don't worry about anything.  Because a bright future awaits everyone.  Not everyone.  The best thing you can do is not worry about anything.  Because at last, this is all a dream.  And we gotta also dream big.  See?  Made me feel like crying.  What's to do that?  Ah, this song is beautiful. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Makes me feel calm and relaxed.  Gives me a big smile.  Oh, really?  Well, today, I was mad at my dad.  But now I just want to hug him.  This life is so full of joy.  Fuck you and your joyful life.  No, you didn't.  Fuck you and your joy.  You didn't finish it.  This life is full of joy and happiness.  Do not let no one change life.  That's a jerk. 
[00:52:00]  Be happy.  Give everything you have in this life.  And never stop smiling.  It's because it's all fucking...  It's a facade.  It's all bullshit.  These people writing this crap.  The same people that would smack their kids around.  Life is beautiful.  And then the second the piano music stops,  he's belting his wife in the mouth.  What about this one?  Yeah, I'm so pumped for peace and tranquility.  Yeah.  How are you pumped for peace and tranquility?  Good.  Oh, bravo.  Bravo.  Look, I got a Pez dispenser on my lap 
[00:52:30]  and I'm making it clap with my two fingers.  Oh.  That's Seinfeld.  Wait, let's go for the next...  Let's go for the next suggested video.  This one's called  The Most Relaxing Music Imaginable.  Okay, so this is different.  Holy shit, almost 13 million views.  This is a little different.  You like this?  It's more new agey.  I never thought of going on YouTube for relaxing music.  See, this is...  I like some of this shit.  See?  This I don't mind.  It's kind of up.  You can shut your eyes and relax to this  and make believe you're in outer space. 
[00:53:00]  This?  This is too high up for that.  Yeah, it's a little too high tempo.  Well, maybe if you don't have headphones on.  It's just barely playing in the background.  This is like Avatar music.  Let's play some Enya.  Enya.  I don't know.  Yeah, this might be a little too much,  but this has nothing to do with piano music.  See, I don't mind.  You don't mind this one?  No, I'm saying...  I wouldn't play it,  but it doesn't anger me to the point 
[00:53:30]  where I have to turn the fucking radio off  when those dumb commercials come on.  I'm with you, though.  I'm not a big fan of the piano, either.  Relaxing music I like,  but piano by itself...  Piano's just...  How about some...  Hey, Lottie, Lottie!  Lottie, Lottie!  You hate that piano, too?  Hey, Lottie!  No, that's great shit.  That's upbeat.  I like, like, you know,  fucking ragtime piano.  Like, ragtime.  Get...  Right.  Get us some ragtime piano  by John Valby going into break. 
[00:54:00]  We'll show you what the piano's supposed to do.  Yes.  Do you know what I can't find by Valby?  He did a solo called Flying.  His old...  When I was a kid...  Oh, he played it for us.  But I don't know where to find that anymore.  His, uh...  It's his legit music?  It's his stuff that he would do  on his dirty CDs.  He would do this...  Or his dirty tapes.  He would do these, like,  legit piano solos.  And was it either after Dirt  or Give Me Dirt or Give Me Death,  which were the name of these cassette tapes.  It was on one of them,  and it's not on the...  He doesn't put it on the CDs for some reason.  Yeah, I don't know.  I haven't heard that in years, 
[00:54:30]  but it's no lyrics.  It's just him showing what he could really...  It's really good, too, man.  I wish...  If anybody has it  and could email it  to therealjimnorton at gmail  flying by John Valby  off Give Me Dirt or Give Me Death.  And Big Beto from Texas,  I want to acknowledge  that I know what Hearts of Space is all about.  You ever listen to Hearts of Space,  that radio show?  Hearts of Space?  An hour of this type of music.  Is it on this ridiculous platform?  Sometimes you would travel to the clouds.  Yeah?  Yes.  You would have a music journey to the clouds. 
[00:55:00]  Oh.  You want to do a little Hearts of Space?  A little, um...  You got any of the, uh...  What are you doing?  Like astral projection?  All sorts of shit, man.  That happens?  Do you leave your body  and cruise through the cosmos?  Sometimes you would climb the Himalayas  for an hour.  For an hour.  For an hour?  Yeah.  Or walk through the jungle,  a rainforest.  As you just kind of lay there  with your eyes shut,  listening to certain music  and it conjures up images.  I'm not even going to lie to you.  I liked it back in the day,  back in the day.  That could work. 
[00:55:30]  Shit like that.  On Sunday nights,  after a long weekend of partying,  you just chill out.  I love to hear this.  And you walk through the rainforest.  I love to hear this.  What is this one called?  An Audio Introduction to Hearts of Space.  No, no.  Fuck that.  Fuck the intro.  Get me right into it.  I'm telling you,  they come up with names.  Get me right into it.  Slow music for fast times.  You like that?  What is that about?  I want to read a few of these.  Guitar Space.  Yeah, Guitar Space.  World Space.  Celtic Space. 
[00:56:00]  Electronic Space.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Oh, how about World Space?  World Space.  I want to feel that.  You're not going to like World Space.  Why?  Too much black shit.  Here's that Hearts of Space.  Why is this a minute?  All right.  Oh, man.  It's like the call to prayer.  This is good.  Clits should shrivel when they hear this.  Fuck, they pull the hood over their heads.  Oh, this is beheading music.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, Lord.  I actually like some of that hardcore fucking Muslim Arab music.  I like that in camp sometimes.  You'll hear one.  You're like, fuck.  I do understand how this would inspire you to attack a contractor.  To just kill.  Stephen Hill.  Oh, that was a Hearts of Space minute with a Turkish Balkan drum.  No, no, Stephen.  It was 36 seconds.  Yeah.  Stop talking, Stephen.  Can you give us a minute?  A template of music from around the world and across the country.  Why are you whispering, Stephen? 
[00:57:00]  Try Celtic Space.  I want to hear Celtic Space.  Yeah.  Or Celtic.  I'm sure it's Celtic.  Well, I'll go with Celtic.  Here's a Hearts of Space minute.  Ah, I love you.  I want to matter you.  You could do that with every single one of these.  All right, go to another one.  I could totally do this if I knew it.  Go to Piano Space. 
[00:57:30]  Let's see if this piano is a little better for Ant.  Oh, Christ.  There's a Hearts of Space minute.  Yeah.  Ugh.  No.  This is just depressing, creepy piano music.  Turkish music was good.  Fuck this shit.  Think the old detective movies.  Oh, what?  Sure.  Yeah.  I knew she'd come in eventually.  Paris Stems on her.  I drank a shot of whiskey when I saw a silhouette in my doorway. 
[00:58:00]  Then we fucked over my desk.  I had cigarette breath and plaque on my teeth.  It was the 50s.  And it was perfectly normal to drink a coffee and smoke a cigarette and then kiss a date.  And you couldn't see her retching off camera.  My awful ciggy breath.  Ciggy breath?  You think everyone just had really bad breath?  Terrible breath.  Terrible.  I put my cigarette out on that little dimple over her back.  My breath smelled like rotted tooth in ciggies and coffee. 
[00:58:30]  You know they didn't invent tongue scrapers.  So there was no scraping of the tongue.  Sam Spade saying that.  So I used my tongue scrapers to not offend the woman.  I kept all the gunk under my desk so I could enjoy and sniff it later.  After the dame left.  Sometimes I would rub it all over my genitals.  Why do I have to do that?  Why does it go there?  Flow chart.  Flow chart.  43 and tomorrow.  Oh, tomorrow.  I'm going to get pissed with Lady Gaga.  Damn, you're older than me now.  That's so weird.  How did that happen? 
[00:59:00]  How did that happen?  What year did we fucking cross?  I think 39.  39.  Yeah, that's about right.  It's depressing.  This one sucks.  In your 40s.  It was a hot day.  The kind of day that makes the ball bag stick to your thigh.  He always describes that like the weather.  My ankle was swollen because if you don't have orthotics, it's 1951.  So I have fat, swollen ankles all the time and dumpster breath.  So I kissed that dame.  I don't shave my pubes either. 
[00:59:30]  My ass crack is smelly.  But you know, she was on Kept too.  They weren't shaving down there.  Her big bush.  Her vagina smelled like a garbage bag robbing a bank.  You know what?  Sully Erna's got a whole fucking album of this shit.  Yeah.  And it's really good.  His solo album is called Avalon.  It's not for everybody, but he did a goddamn good job with it.  What are you supposed to do?  Fall asleep to this shit?  I used to.  I used to put this shit on.  I couldn't imagine driving home to this. 
[01:00:00]  I would fucking be into an embankment.  I put some of this shit on while I'm falling asleep.  And that's why no vocals.  Because as soon as the vocals kick in, it wakes you up.  You're like, what the fuck's going on?  I fall asleep to Seinfeld episodes.  You can fall asleep with the TV on.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't have to.  You can't either.  Because I could turn my head away.  I know it's happening.  I've seen them all so many times that I could just listen to the audio.  And then before I know it, the dumb alarm's going off.  And Kenny's calling me.  Time to wake up.  I envy that.  What? 
[01:00:30]  What?  Kenny calling?  Yes.  His voice.  His soothing voice in the morning.  I envy how well you sleep.  I might have slept two good hours last night.  Yeah, me too.  Just tossing it.  9.30.  Bam.  Out last night.  9 fucking 30.  Out.  I was at 2 o'clock looking at my clock.  Yeah.  Not being out of sleep.  Yeah.  Oh, it was wonderful.  Yep.  Should we break?  Where's our cereal?  I could eat.  Where's our cereal?  I'm going to eat a sandwich so I don't eat so much cereal.  I have about two hours before I start panicking.  Cereal.  We should talk World Cup a little bit. 
[01:01:00]  A little bit because it's girls.  And the British Open was won by a partier, man.  Yeah, this guy's out partying the whole fucking night.  He's known for this, though.  Darren Clark.  It couldn't have happened to a better guy.  They're so happy this guy won this fucking thing.  So maybe we'll talk about that a little bit.  Was he Scottish or something?  No, he's from Northern Ireland, man.  Northern Ireland?  Yeah, he's a Northern Ireland gay.  Hey.  Ah, the Pete.  Ah, the Pete.  Tells a story about how he got, like, the heads up that the bar he was in. 
[01:01:30]  He's a big drinker.  He got the heads up that the fucking bar was going to be blown up.  What?  Oh, yeah.  And guess what?  It blew up.  And he was out of there before it happened because he got the fucking.  Got the word.  Got the word.  Get the fuck out of that place.  Where is this?  Who is this?  Darren Clark.  He's got a hell of a story.  He lost a wife to breast cancer.  He's just a solid dude on the PGA Tour.  And he won the British Open.  He's ranked, like, 111th in the world.  Like, it's a pretty good story if you give a fuck about golf. 
[01:02:00]  And he's been up ever since.  Like, they're tweeting pictures of him completely fucking either still drunk or hung over with the jug.  I forgot how it happened.  Wait, he was supposed to be in a bar that blew up?  Yeah, that's years ago.  I mean, it's just part of his resume.  How did he get the word?  Chives, do you know the story of Darren Clark and the bar he was in that blew up?  No.  Oh.  Sorry.  Cocoa Pebbles.  How about this?  Someone after the break will have the story for us.  Because I was half listening.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I don't know what happened. 
[01:02:30]  Maybe they were describing a movie.  I don't know.  A movie?  I don't know.  Sounds like some kind of movie.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I hope it is.  I don't want Cocoa Pebbles.  Well.  Wait, let's see the choices.  God damn it.  The Apple Jacks box is nice and big.  They know what they're fucking doing, man.  Yes.  They know you could eat a whole box of that shit.  I guess they decided with the Frankenberry, Count Chocula, and Boo Berry that they're only  selling it around Halloween.  I guess, yeah.  I guess sugar cereals don't sell like they used to.  That's probably all it is.  Brody Pebbles with dumb looking Fred on the front. 
[01:03:00]  I hate Fred Flintstone.  That's 3D Fred.  Look, we got two of the same.  We're dumb.  Cocoa and Fruity are different.  We should have fucking...  Mixed it up a little.  ...chose better.  Yeah, god damn it.  And what are they making?  These little thin boxes, too.  I know.  And they make the milk look like a fucking money shot.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  That's on purpose.  Anyway, I took a whole class on that in college.  If you look into the Fruity Pebbles right now, I guarantee you'll see a bunch of dicks  and vignettes.  Subliminal.  I guarantee.  Give me the box.  I'll fucking circle.  Subliminal. 
[01:03:30]  It's all about subliminal.  Well, no.  This one just has cum.  Look, that's all just dripping cum.  Cum shots, yeah.  Because your milk doesn't look like that.  It's fucking Fruity Bukkake.  Yeah, there's one vagina.  Two vagina.  Three vagina.  Four.  Five vagina.  Six vagina.  Give me a clothespin before I smell some more.  These are all vagina lips.  Oh, are they?  And they also like orgy scenes.  If you look closely, you'd think it's a lot of bodies just having sex.  I saw a macaroni and cheese ad from like the 80s, and it was a bunch of bodies intertwined 
[01:04:00]  fucking each other.  Yeah, yeah.  They do that on purpose.  Oh, yeah.  Booze ads, too.  When you see a glass with ice cubes in it and a little scotch in there or something,  there are weird things happening in the reflections.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  I don't believe in any of that stuff, but I did start shoving camels up my ass and rubbing  them on my face.  Camel cigarettes.  I thought you meant real camels.  No.  If anybody remembers that ad campaign.  Yes.  Dick and Balls.  Joe Camel.  Joe Camel, yeah.  His face looked like a Dick and Balls. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, boy.  Joe Camel.  I got this funny bit on Dick and Cider, by the way.  Remind me to...  I was thinking that last night.  That idiot.  Dick and Cider.  Hey, guys.  We're going to get a lot of vitamins with our Fruity Pebbles.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  We're getting a lot of vitamins.  I was looking part of this complete breakfast, and they show a complete breakfast, and then  the cereal, which doesn't matter at all nutritional-wise.  How are you getting all these vitamins?  Why do they crunch up, like, multi-vitamins in this thing? 
[01:05:00]  A lot of vitamins in that shit.  It's the only way they could sell a sugary cereal these days.  It's like, hey, look, it's good for your kid.  A lot of vitamins.  The second ingredient in Cocoa Pebbles.  Sugar.  Sugar.  Rice.  Rice and sugar.  Yeah, but all the other ingredients.  Or sugar, but they just say it differently.  Any mons, sodium, glutamate?  Hmm.  I have...  Why do they need hydrogenated vegetable oil?  Why do they need vegetable oil?  No.  Aloe.  Aloe.  How are you?  I just can't stop today. 
[01:05:30]  Uh-oh.  Red 40 and yellow 6.  That doesn't sound good.  And then they go with some yellow 5, a blue 2, and a blue 1.  What does blue 3 look like?  That they didn't use that.  I don't know.  I guess it wasn't the right blue.  Sugar is number one ingredient in Apple Jacks.  Number one ingredient is sugar.  Wait, should it be apples?  There's no apples in that motherfucker.  Or at least some playing cards.  See, you need... 
[01:06:00]  To open, you need Apple Jacks or better.  When I get excited, I always...  I sugar-sugar cereal.  You certainly sugar-sugar that.  Hey, you guys want to look at the subliminal ads that Sam just popped up?  Ah, look at that.  Did you think I fucked up?  That's a rod right there.  What do we got?  Well, that's the Little Mermaid.  The Little Mermaid.  That's a practical joke on the artist.  Yeah, that was someone that was pissed off that day.  Penises.  What's that big fucking...  Yeah, that.  What is that from? 
[01:06:30]  Bread is life.  That's not bread.  That's cock and balls.  It's cock and balls.  Come on.  I mean, can't you be a little more subtle?  That wasn't subliminal advertising.  No, not at all.  That's subliminal for bread.  Yeah.  I want cock.  Oh, I see.  What is that?  Yeah, I see.  On this particular...  Brazilian soda.  Brazilian soda.  It looks like a girl with big bosoms.  Oh, big girl.  And hair flowing. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, hair flowing.  Oh, well.  Their logo, if you break it down.  Break it down.  Oh, yeah.  The ice cubes are classic.  Oh, yeah.  You could always put some...  What do we got in these ice cubes?  Oh, it says sex in the...  It's just the word sex.  It's like a seven-year-old man.  But how the fuck does that make you buy shit?  Oh, look.  It says wiener.  They used to do that in movie theaters.  They would flash coke.  Yep.  And it would...  Coke would go up.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And Joe Camel with his ball-back face.  We know that one.  What are those? 
[01:07:30]  It says absolute vodka in the ice cubes.  It says absolute subliminal.  Oh, absolute subliminal.  So that was their gag anyway.  It was supposed to be seen.  That's just a cock and balls.  Joe Camel's big cock and balls thing.  His limp dick.  Or it's Jay-Z.  We're not really sure.  All right.  Well, now I want to eat.  Yeah, I used to do advertising for a living.  We'd always draw stuff in the ice.  Yeah?  Like what?  Pictures of smiling girls. 
[01:08:00]  And that's the old thing?  Like muscles.  Hey, is this going to throw off Kenny's schedule that we're eating Apple Jacks instead of the...  He has no idea.  He's panicking right now.  You think he's panicking?  He's angry.  Is there the multigrain Cheerios that he usually serves us every morning?  This is really going to bother him, I think.  I don't know what to do.  This is out of the ordinary.  I'm confused.  They want cinnamon toasty...  A is for Apple, J is for Jacks.  Cinnamon toasty Apple Jacks.  You need a good breakfast, that's a fact. 
[01:08:30]  I want to go to...  Start it off with Apple Jacks.  I want to go to the Honeycomb Hideout.  Arby's hat equals a big condom.  All right, now they're coming in.  A lot of people know this shit.  So we got to...  I need some Darren Clark shit, please.  Maybe some World Cup shit, please.  And other things that happened over the weekend, I guess.  Yeah.  You can tell by the snout that she isn't feeling well 
[01:09:00]  As the end of the month rolls around  You can tell by the stench there's some trouble up her trench  As the end of the month rolls around  Oh, hi, hi, hey, what you got to say?  Just your orders out and clear  Because if a regular large drags the middle part  As the end of the month rolls around  A little thing starts to sing when you pull up on the string  As the end of the month rolls around 
[01:09:30]  It'll stick to your dick unless you fuck her real quick  As the end of the month rolls around  Oh, hi, hey, what you got to say?  Just your orders out and clear  Think I'm super regular large drags the middle part  As the end of the month rolls around  You want some sick ones now?  Oh, you're going to gag in a bag  If you try to eat a rag  I'm getting some money all the time 
[01:10:00]  Well, worse than that  Oh, it's no surprise on her thighs  When you see a million flies  Yeah, but it's great  When your favorite day  Calls you up and says, buddy  My period is late  Yeah, at the end of the month  This is the Opie and Anthony Show 
[01:10:30]  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  Is all about shameless self-promotion  So why don't you just go ahead and follow us on Twitter  Twitter.com slash Opie Radio  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia  And Twitter.com slash Jim Norton  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  Well, no one's calling about Darren Clark 
[01:11:00]  So I don't know if that story's true  About the bar blowing up  And him getting word ahead of time  And he left the bar  I'm going to say Bravo Sierra  I sort of watched the British Open  I guess I can be honest about that too now  I sort of watched it  I was watching and then I fell asleep  Mid-morning nap with my kid  And then I woke up because he sunk the putt on 18 
[01:11:30]  Your kid?  Yeah, in my dream, my kid, yes  I woke up with a kid and he sunk the putt  And then I knew Darren Clark won the British Open  So then I come on the radio and make believe I saw every shot  Yeah  Because that's how radio works  But that's how we do this, right?  Yeah  You just see a little bit of something  And then you talk about it like you saw the whole thing  I do know he's a partier  He loves, he was smoking on the course  Really?  He was having some cigarettes on the course  Good butts  That's allowed? 
[01:12:00]  Just putting him out in the fairway basically  As he's walking  Like a regular guy  He's a regular guy  That's it  And then the, what is it called?  The claret jug?  Is that how you say it?  Oh, is that like the prize?  Yeah  And he was drinking all night  And smoking cigars  And he hasn't slept yet  Wow  When we came into work a couple hours ago at this point  He still hasn't slept yet  Wow  Yeah  Partier  He's been enjoying his victory big time  That's a partying guy  And now he's doing interviews 
[01:12:30]  And they're, what, six hours ahead of us?  So  That was at 5.30  So we're talking, what, 11.30 in the morning  He still didn't go to bed  He beat you in  That's nice  Yeah, you did  Yeah, I was up until about 8.30  Maybe 9 o'clock  Sunday morning  From Saturday night  But that was that  Then I just passed out  I woke up  I woke up yesterday  Probably around 7 p.m  And then  Was back in bed at 9.30 p.m 
[01:13:00]  Wow  Wow, really?  Yeah, I just came downstairs  Enough to shove some food in my face  And then I was just like  You know what?  Fuck this  I'm going back to bed  Wow  Did you have one of those bad hangovers?  No, the hangover wasn't bad  It was  I was just exhausted, tired  Yeah  I was good  Because I  Right before I went to bed  I ate  And then I threw a couple of Excedrin  Down my yap  And I was pretty good  And you were good to go  Yeah  And I slept so long  You missed a really hot day yesterday  But you know what? 
[01:13:30]  From Friday and Saturday  It was  The weather was great  I was outside by the pool  The entire time  So if I missed a Sunday  Fuck it  Who cares  What are you going to do?  Yeah  I'd rather sleep sometimes  It's going to be really hot this week, huh?  This week  Hot  Nice  Just going to be lounging  Lounging at the pool  Would you rather have it really hot  Or really cold?  Really hot  Yeah, exactly  Hate the cold  Cold is pain 
[01:14:00]  Heat can be uncomfortable  But cold is literal pain  It hurts you  As if somebody  Was squeezing your fingers in a vice  And it's just a pain in the ass  To have to get so gussied up  Before you go out in the winter  You can't just throw on a t-shirt and shorts  And leave  Bundle up layers  Fuck you  You notice it's getting a little darker out  In the morning  Don't start that shit  I noticed like when the alarm went off  I looked out the window  And I'm like  Yeah, I remember it kind of being a little lighter 
[01:14:30]  That's because the clouds are up  Nope  I think it has to do with our position  In the universe  Do people know that  We only get to see  Oh  Sliver  We only get to see daylight  For a month and a half  Coming into work  That's pretty much it  Yeah  A month and a half  That's why when you just said that  I'm like  Don't even start with that shit  Because we notice the time changing  Way before anyone else  Yeah  Because for about a month and a half  Every year  When I walk out of my building 
[01:15:00]  It's nice and bright out  It's like  Ah, this is how it's supposed to be  When you leave for work  Yeah  And then you leave  And it's just dark  And we get about  Ten to ten and a half months  Of just darkness  The first time we see daylight  Is after the show's over  Mm-hmm  Yeah  All dark and nasty  Eat it  We got people with the Darren Clark story  Oh  We're gonna try Sean and PA  Sean  Good morning, boys  Good morning, Sean  How are you today?

Oh, you were correct  Darren Clark was in a bar  Many, many years ago  And he got tipped off  That there was gonna be  An IRA bombing  And he got the hell out of there  And 15 minutes after he left  The bar blew up 
[01:16:30]  So this selfish asshole  Didn't tell other people?  Yeah, what about that?  Sure he did  That's just that  That's the way  The broadcast portrayed it  Wait, that's a great point  Did he tell everyone else?  That should have been  An empty bar  That fucking blew up  Yeah  They didn't elaborate  Well, maybe it's so common  That people are like  Yeah, sure  Yeah  Yeah, it's gonna be this bar  Shut up  It was back in the 80s  And it was the IRA  So  They were pretty  Called from Sinn Féin  Sinn Féin  Is that how you say it?  Ah, something like that  Jerry Adams 
[01:17:00]  Hey, Sam  Can we have the Celtic music  For this break?  Thank you  Oh  From Hearts of Space  Or wherever  Richard, California  Hey, Arntown in New York  Actually  Okay  Fair enough  That guy was somewhat correct  Darren Clark was working in a bar  And a call came in  Tipped him off  And he did clear all the people out  And 15 minutes later  It blew up  Oh, he did  Okay, so they would call  And tell you  That there was a bomb  And you would get everybody out  Okay 
[01:17:30]  So he's a hero  Yeah, he's a hero  Yeah, the IRA was courteous enough  To place a phone call  Before they blew up the bar  Did they normally do that  Or did they ever  I'm sure there were times  They said, fuck  Yeah, yeah  Would they ever not call?  I'm sure  The line's fucking busy  Fuck them  The line's fucking busy  Just get the kegs out  Get the Guinness kegs out  You fucking  This isn't  This isn't the right Celtic music  This is  Chariots of fur  It's a fur

[01:18:30]  Up in Canada  I was reading a thing  On findarticles.com  And it says  It's got a quote  From Clark  Where he worked  In a nightclub  And basically  They phoned in  To say that the bomb  Was going to go off  In 15 minutes  Everyone clears out  Fake or real?  Fake  Fake accent?  Yeah  Of course it's fake  Of course it's fake  It's faker than Tommy Lee Jones  Looking for Liam  To blow up something 
[01:19:00]  Uh-oh  Very good, Darren  Thank you, sir  I appreciate it  Alright, so the British Open  Was pretty cool  You don't watch that golf shit, huh?  Um  No  No, I don't  Not even the Masters?

Yeah  Well, that makes up for the American team  Where they look like men  Some of those women  Wow  And some people are trying to say  That the goalie for the U.S.  Hope Solo  Or something like that  Hope Solo?

Oh, just some women's soccer plan  Tits are bouncing 
[01:27:30]  Out of breath  Not because she's out of shape  It's because she has big tits  Giant tits  A team of giant tits  Then I'd watch  Yeah  That's great  I guess the U.S. blew it, though  They should have had the cup  Well, from what I hear  They scored and couldn't hold on  They had a 2-1 lead  And then they went into that defensive shit 
[01:28:00]  Every team makes that mistake  They have a lead late in the game  And instead of just keep playing the way you were playing  They go into some kind of defensive mode  Defensive mode  And then they wind up blowing  They always wind up blowing  As soon as they go into that defensive mode shit  Then you're letting the opposition  Into your side of the  On your side of the field  Keep playing  Put the pressure on them  And I have no idea what I'm talking about  And then the Japanese team  I guess scored late  And then they had  Oh, we won  Oh, we won  Oh, we won  They all covered their little mouths 
[01:28:30]  With their tiny hands  And went  Oh, we won  Oh, we won  Oh, yeah  But it was decided on PKs  Yeah  I don't know if you want the World Cup decided on PKs  PKs?  Penalty kicks?  Yeah, they like to call it PKs in the biz  Oh  Why wouldn't they just keep playing?  They're in shape  Yeah  Why would you have the World Cup decided on penalty kicks?

[01:33:00]  And just instantly  Going down on her  I would think about  Rock chicks doing that  Like when they're all  You see them all sweaty  On stage  Yeah  And just the second  They come backstage  You just shove your face  See what that would be like  And the worst thing ever  Was thinking  Of what it would be like  To have to go down  On Tina Turner  After  After she just  Rocked the joint  After she shakes her legs  For two and a half hours  Yeah, yeah  And she's just sweating profusely  Her back would probably be worse  Than her asshole or pussy  You think?  Yeah  The sheen of sweat  Hey, we're gonna keep on 
[01:33:30]  Fucking black eye  Mike Beltner  From missing a note  But the problem is  The sweat goes down the back  Yeah, right down the crack  Into the hiney  And then kind of  Swerves back around  To the front  Yeah  And then it's being  Like sucked in  Through the ass cheeks  Moving  It's wicking  A wick action  Absolutely  Down to the vaginal area  What was that one show?  I think Tina Turner  Would have the stinkiest pussy  After a show  That's what I vote  I would go with  Janis Joplin 
[01:34:00]  Wow  I bet Janis  Janis had a nasty big  Ugh  Yeah  Oh, look at her sweating  You know, where's that going?  It's all heading south for gravity  But at least she was  Gravity's pulling that fucking sweat  All down there  I got a question for you, sir  Yeah  Tina Turner  Never  Janis Joplin  I'd have to go Janis Joplin  Oh, you're fucking  You're crazy  I'd have to  Your racism is so strong  I'd have to  My racism's so strong  There's not even a question 
[01:34:30]  On that one  No, no  Put up Janis Joplin  Janis Joplin  Pick a good one, too  Oh, my God  There are no good ones  I don't care  Look at her with the drink  Down there  No, no, no  Come on  Really?

No, it was me  I just dropped it  Oh, I just thought  I just fucked up your phone  No, no, no  I put my hands out like a  I guess  Because I feel like a 13-year-old girl  Trying to get a Lady Gaga picture  So I even catch, like, one  Yeah  Aw, you really want that picture  I like her, man  I genuinely am a fan  I think it's more an obsession  To get the picture 
[01:53:30]  No, I like  Than the picture itself  I think getting the picture  Is a bigger issue for Jimmy  Than the picture itself  Sometimes, but with Lady Gaga  Because, like  Are you really a fan?  I really  I went and saw her in concert  With my ex  And I fucking  I had fun  What was his name?  Fruit  Biff Turtleberg  I don't mind a couple of her songs  But I wouldn't call myself  I wouldn't call myself a fan  I like the new  I like the new CD, too  I like fucking Judas  I like Hair  Hair, what's that? 
[01:54:00]  It's one of her songs  It's a good song  It is a good song  It's a really good song  Government Hooker's a good song  What?  What's that about?  Look at you guys  I actually like her  I don't like her to be ironic  Because I think I'm fucking  You want to see her up close, too, right?  So you can see her  I am attracted to her  But I'm more like  I'm a fucking  I'm a fan of her music  Yeah?  Yeah  I loved it  Like, last year  When I was at Montreal  In the festival  I was at lunch  With my girlfriend  And Voss  And Bobby Kelly  There's a bunch of comics  And none of us  Can agree on music 
[01:54:30]  Oh, really?  But fucking Alejandro  Was playing  And that was the only thing  Alejandro  Alejandro  Alejandro  And we were all like  You know what?  This is fucking good  Like, everybody agreed  She has a pretty good  I guess  It's very poppy  Yeah  So, you know  People are gonna like it  This is the video for Hair  That's a good song  This is the song  Lady Gaga  By the way  It's probably a hack  But the Evian commercial  Where they have  Those t-shirts  It fucking cracked me up  Really? 
[01:55:00]  Is that hack?  Yeah, a little bit  It probably is, right?  Just a tad  Yeah  Oh, what are you gonna do?  Here's Hair  By Lady Gaga  I'm the only station  That really rocked  Alright, another one  That starts with this  Moaning and droning  How does it start?  Eh, well  Whenever I'm just cool  My parents put up a fight  Sounds like another song  I swear to you  You and I in America  I don't know what it's like  Laura Branigan  Oh, no 
[01:55:30]  Totally Clips of the Heart  No  That's Kim Carnes  Oh  What?  It starts off like  Promises in the Dark  Alright, hit that again  Hold on  Start it over  She's fucking ripping  Everybody off  Start it over  Start it over  I'm hearing Promises in the Dark  Pat Benatar  After this ooh ooh ooh part  Where it kicks in  We'll have to hear that  We can't just  Alright, hold on  It's a whole song  Just this part 
[01:56:00]  Hold on  Let the whole song play through  And we'll talk about it  Yeah, exactly  No  A little bit  Alright  Alright, stop that  Let's hear Promises in the Dark  Because I'm sure  We Rex got it already  Yeah  Yeah, there's something 
[01:56:30]  Going on there  Just a little faster  Yeah, there's something there  It's not blatant  As the Madonna one  Whatever have you again  It's a good song too  God, I'm a girl  I'm a girl  I like Pat Benatar  She had a couple good songs  Oh, my balls are fucking itching 
[01:57:00]  Why?  I was just digging my nails  Into my balls  Like a Komodo dragon  Bonnie Tyler  Didn't I say  Oh, I said Kim Cynes  I'm sorry  I have it on my iPod too  I think there's a little  Bonnie Tyler happening there too  Go back to hair  Now it kicks in  Darn  All right  Yeah, fuck it  Go back to hair  I was enjoying that  Let's go back to hair 
[01:57:30]  There is one part that's a blatant ripoff though  Yeah  This process is up there  A little bit, man  There's a part that is  When it comes, I'll tell you  It's a blatant ripoff  Not of Pat Benatar  We're never going to get that far into the songs  No, you can get it  Wait  Right  Right  No 
[01:58:00]  No  This is great  Our song is starting to get that  They're all kind of sounding the same sound  I'm out of love  I'm not a freak  Unless we're fighting to take all the dreams  I'm out of love  She was very Maggie Rink  You see  Are you enjoying this? 
[01:58:30]  I love it  I do too  I'm free of my  Goodness gracious  What's your favorite song on the new CD?  Judas by far  Judas  I wouldn't say by far  I love Judas  I do too  I kind of wish she didn't say Gaga in the chorus  I like the fact that she's  I don't know  First I'd like you to get back to our show  And turn the out cue feed off  You want to listen to Judas?  This isn't the same song?  No  Come on, man 
[01:59:00]  She puts out some fucking coat tappers  Oh, yeah  Sounds great on amyl nitrate poppers, I hear  I would hope so  Believe me  Or dozens  God damn it  Are you fucking with me?  Yeah  Ah, no  I'm enjoying this 
[01:59:30]  Yeah  That's great  Holy shit  I got so much sugar in me right now  Oh, you're going to forget what you eat, two bowls of that cereal?  Oh, God  Three  Oh, shit  This is the shit, man  They turn us off  Come on, my fucking girlfriend and I are dancing  I don't know  Yeah, everything sounds like a ray of light  A couple of ladies are dancing in here  Some of us are having a good time  Sam and I look like the beginning of every Ellen show  I'd go see her again if she was around 
[02:00:00]  Yeah  She was great live  She was awesome  So my point is  We're playing the shit out of her music  She ain't even coming by this show  I know  How much of saps we are  That's right  Yeah  Can we hear a  Total Eclipse of the Heart?  Total Eclipse of the Heart?  That's a good song, too  Turn around  Fucking piano  Yeah  Fucking pianos  Turn around  Every now and then 
[02:00:30]  I get a little bit lonely  And you're never coming around  Turn around  Every now and then  I get a little bit tired  Listening to the sound of my tears  Jimmy's singing along with his ass  No way he's got a third one in him  There's no way  Now you're skirting danger  I heard that  Number four would be a painful accident  That was a little immersed 
[02:01:00]  See how things work out  When you're just off the cuff like we are  That is hilarious  Do you want to listen to Judas again?  I'm not  No  I'm an  Oh shit  It's on my phone  It's on Jimmy's phone  What song is this?  Americano  Oh, this is a good song, too  I know this  Yeah  This album was very influenced by Springsteen, I think  Because there's a lot of saxophone on it 
[02:01:30]  Which didn't appear on the last album  Stop it  You read that somewhere  No  By the way, this is how stupid Bob Kelly is  We were at the cellar  I think the big guy played for Lady Gaga  Yes, he did  He's got a connection  He's in the new single  Because she was really bummed when he died  Oh my God  Did that fucking  She was really bummed when he died  I'm just getting the Gaga fucking farts here  This is terrible  Holy shit  This is the music Jimmy plays  That helps him get that last knuckle in  This is how dumb Bob is  Oh my God 
[02:02:00]  It's so bad  This one's a bad one  Dude, it's so bad  My music is all over the room  That was the Cocoa Pebbles  Cocoa Pebbles makes me gassy  Holy shit  I was  Left some in your pants  We were at the comedy  We were at the cellar this weekend  And I was talking to  Me and Bob were playing chess  On Chess with Friends  And I forget how chess came up  We were just talking about it  And then we talked about the guys in the park  And I'm like  I've never played in the park  I'm like, but those guys  Oh, you've played in the park  The park  There's people behind the tree 
[02:02:30]  In the park  Oh, you've played  A lot of those homeless guys  That play chess  Are fucking like  Master level players  Like they're  It's done them well  But they play for food  Like they're fucking  Yeah  Those guys  And they shit talk  You know  They're really good  Literally  How's your shit?  That's in my pants  How's yours?  Their shit talk  Is literal shit talk  It's like mashed potatoes  I'm sitting on here  Check  But they're hard guys to beat 
[02:03:00]  They make money doing that  That's how  They buy whatever they want to buy  So a lot of the grandmasters  When they come to do tournaments  Will go to the park  And play those guys  Because the grandmasters  Are better players  But I think they're hard to beat  It's an uncomfortable atmosphere  And you know what I mean?  It's like  It's good to  You never knew all this was going on over there 
[02:03:30]  Those guys are for real players  Oh yeah  I would never play in the park  Or if I did  I would just go knowing I'm going to lose  I should just try it  I don't know why  You'll like it  I would lose every game  Try it  You'll like it  Nah  Try it  You'll like it  And fucking  So I'm talking to Bob  We're at the table  And I'm like  Yeah man  A lot of the times  Grandmasters will go into the park  And just play these guys  And just to brush up  And he goes  Ah dude  You probably fucking heard that somewhere  And I'm like 
[02:04:00]  Of course I did  You idiot  I'm not a chess grandmaster  I heard that  Of course I heard that somewhere  Isn't that how all knowledge is passed on?  Ah you probably heard that  But it's like  Bob  What do you do?  Just like mention things  That you  You only talk about things you create in the moment  You idiot  Things he's actually experienced  That's what all of life is  You hear things  And you pass them on  No one actually  Yeah  You probably heard that somewhere  It's like  Did you make up math, Bob?  You fucking idiot  Did you hear it somewhere?  Yeah, dude 
[02:04:30]  You know what, dude  You're saying that  Like you know it  I'm like  I do know it  It was taught to me  And now I know it  Bob  You mean  Fucking aggressive asshole  He's such an asshole  Oh, that's great  He gets so uptight  Bob is a jerk  A jerk  Oh, but he thought he had me  Like he got so annoyed  That I  Yeah  I'm like  Don't be mad at me  Because I know something  You heard it somewhere  Of course I did  He tries to shame you over knowledge  Dude, what is that?  A book?  Oh, you learned something  Sure, dude  Yeah  Yeah, dude  Just keep saying things  That you heard 
[02:05:00]  Yeah  What's that?  Is that Clarence Clemons right there?  Yeah  What?  He's in a video  Lady Gaga  The Edge of Glory  This is her big single right now  So it's like  Edge of Glory  Darkness on the Edge of Town  And then it's Glory Days  No  So they pretty much  Just took  Let's hear this shit  Took Bruce's titles  For Lady Gaga  I like this one too  It sounds like every song  She does  It really is getting redundant  No  I can tell them all apart 
[02:05:30]  Me too  Of course  She's ugly  She's so ugly  Oh, I love her  There's someone she's gussied up  That looks a little good  Jimmy's always on the Edge of Glory  His lips  Right on the Edge  We got it  I just 
[02:06:00]  It conjured an image  And I had to say it  I think she's going to look sexy today too  You think?  She's going to be all sexy  Because she's filming  So if she's doing Howard  They're filming  She might be performing  On Howard  She is  What?  She's performing  So she'll be lip-syncing on Howard  Performing  She's lip-syncing  Oh yeah?  No, not at all  She's great  Her on fucking Ellen  Doing Speechless on Ellen  It's obviously live  She's phenomenal  Yeah?  Yeah  That's a great 
[02:06:30]  Where's the big man?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Where's the saxophone?  That's the only reason  Why we're listening to this  The big dolt  Where's the sax solo?  Yeah, where's the sax?  Some tribute  Some tribute to the dead guy  Well, he was alive  He's in the video  Yes  Oh  They didn't just roll him out  In a casket  Yeah  She's gyrating and humping  On his groin  Trying to be outrageous  Did you have sex with Lady Gaga?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I got no problem with her 
[02:07:00]  Like  I don't have a big problem with her  I think she's not as pretty as she comes off  Or wants to be  Or is portrayed as being  She looks like  But she's  She has like Eliza Minnelli going on  In her face  I think there's some Marilyn Manson there  Some Marilyn Manson  Very good  Marilyn Manson there  Here comes the solo  She's kind of a downer  The saxophone has to be really easy to play 
[02:07:30]  It sounds the same  Every fucking solo  That's it  Oh, he's still  Going in the background there  I'm on the edge with you  Play it, big man  I'm on the edge  He's the only one sitting down in the video  Yeah  He was a little weak  At this point, I bet  Great  Alright  Gaga's dancing all over the place  Is anyone even listening?  Yes  Enough of her 
[02:08:00]  I wish she was performing here  That would be great  Fuck  You gonna get your picture, Jimmy?  I don't know  I'm gonna try  Anth doesn't like any women that are shapely  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  You know what?  Shapely  Shapely  You don't like girls with a figure  Let me tell you something  I'm cruising through the channels last night  And I passed that Bridezilla show, right?  And there's this black woman  She's getting married  She's got all her bridesmaids out there  Every fucking one of them  Had to be over three bills  Every fucking one of them 
[02:08:30]  And she's talking about how gorgeous  She gonna look in her dress  And I'm just like  That's a woman that thinks she's attractive  And her mans think she's shapely  Fuck that  I don't like pigs  I don't like fatties  Why don't you talk to the guy?  His name's Al  What do you want, Al?  I meant  I meant  And I meant  You don't like juicy women  So you were talking before  About Lady Gaga  Yeah  Right  Let's take a couple of juicy women 
[02:09:00]  Not even black  Alright  Let's talk about Coco  Let's talk about Jennifer Lopez  Let's talk about  No, fuck J-Lo in her fat ass  Oh, dude, she's  I don't  She walked by our studio, man  That one time  Sorry  That shit was alright  She does nothing for me  That J-Lo was fucking hot  Nothing  Does nothing for me  And the ass wasn't out of control  Like I've seen in pictures  Nah  She was fucking  Would you bang this shit right here? 
[02:09:30]  What did you just  I knew  I knew the picture before I ever saw it  Is that your blood sausage?  Of course it is  It's blood sausage  I haven't seen it in a while  It's changed  No, no, J-Lo, sorry  No, nothing  What's wrong with you?  Nothing  What's wrong with me?  I like fucking white chicks  Dude, she is  J-Lo is fucking hot  With asses that are in proportion  To the rest of that fucking body  By the way  Sorry  By the way  By the way  Ian Halpern finally got one right  On our show  We should have pulled the audio  I hope we did 
[02:10:00]  For the show today  E-Rock  You got in nice and early today  To pull that audio, right?  I was looking for it  I was looking for it  Were you?  What?  Oh, boy  I don't have it, no  What audio?  Because you didn't look for it  Ian Halpern predicting  But sometime during the weekend  You heard that Ian Halpern  Predicted this, right?  So why wouldn't you  Pull that audio  For the show today?  It's a big story  J-Lo and Mark  Sex man  What's his name?  Mark Anthony?  Fair question  They're getting a divorce  On the splits  And on this show 
[02:10:30]  A guy we beat up all the time  For never having correct info  He predicted that  J-Lo and Mark Anthony  Were having tough times  And they were going to separate  So why don't we have  That clip today?  E-Rock  What time did you get in?  What time did the sex buzzer?  I got in like 6.41  6.42  What time?  5.43  Was today's official time  Oh, sorry  Yeah, 5  Oh, boy  5.43  5.43  Yeah  Oh, that's right  E-Rock I think was right behind me  When I walked in  Behind?  What did Ian Halpern say on our show  About the J-Lo and Mark Anthony thing? 
[02:11:00]  E, you said you were looking for it  I was looking for it  I did not find it  E-Rock comment?  Yeah  You were looking for it  What do you mean you didn't find it?  E, comment, E?  You archive everything  Look at all these photographers  What's going on?  Oh, that's right  Yeah  Let's hope one of them  Has fucking got my camera in his hand  Oh, shit  Hi  You know, so many pictures are being taken  So it's not like they're adverse to having pictures taken  So what the fuck is wrong with you stepping in  How long does it take, honestly, to take a picture? 
[02:11:30]  But no one has said no  5 seconds  No one has said no  We know how this plays out  Oh, but they will  I don't think so  Alright  I really don't  Want to take some side bets?  I'll take a side bet  No problem  Yeah, we've got to find the people that actually think the picture's going to happen, though  I do  Alright, did you find the Ian Halpern thing yet, E-Rock?  No, I didn't  I bet you 20  Are you trying to find it?  Yes  Isn't it archived, so it's an easy find  So when you said I was trying to find it, I couldn't find it  You were lying to us  It's not archived with him saying J-Lo's prediction  I had his last three or four appearances that I was going through here  And I wasn't finding it 
[02:12:00]  Sam, you think he was going through all the tapes?  He kind of started going through them just now  Okay, thank you  Oh, E-Rock, are you what Sam said?  I heard what he said  Huh?  I heard what he said  And it's true  It's just a prediction  It is true, though, right?  No, his last three appearances were when he was in with the Goddesses  He called in about the Arnold Schwarzenegger book  And when we busted him on the Goddesses being fake  Oh, that's right  By the way, E-Rock 
[02:12:30]  I realized that during our interview in 2003  I didn't mean to, but I quoted Steve C.'s song  But it wasn't a quote of his song  I just happened to say something  Did you say the pendulum is swinging back the other way?  You haven't heard the song yet?  Yeah  I haven't heard the song  Yes  Can we do this after the break?  I was ahead of my time  Sex Bagel  I was ahead of my weight  Interviewed Jim Norton in 2003  Yeah  They literally  That was before Sex Bagel  Sex Buzzer  E-Rock  Eric Nagel  Hawk  Hawk  He was probably still Sex Bagel then, though  Were you Sex Bagel back then? 
[02:13:00]  Yes  He created the name  So a year before he joined our show  He's actually got a good story  When we get back to break  You interviewed Jim Norton  What?  Eric should tell the story of how the name Sex Bagel came about  Oh, God  Again  It's an interesting story  Again  It is interesting  That's my first time in West Palm  That's how long ago that was  And I'm talking about Tough Crowd as if it's a new show  Oh, wow, I want to hear some of this  It's a brand new show  I would talk  Dude  I remember that period  I was so depressed because we were off the radio  Yeah  And you had come to a few gigs  Can I reference you?  Having come to a couple of gigs with me 
[02:13:30]  And  You know  Sitting in the audience is just like sitting on the stage  Oh, yeah  Great  Thanks, Colin  No, no, not Tough Crowd  Gigs  Like you had come to Dallas with me  I also went to a couple of Tough Crowd tapings  You went to them like  They gave me a nice seat  In the audience  Yeah  I was sad and down on my luck  A stalker Patty gets to get on stage  Oh, yeah  Chums  Yeah, she got a college show  Chums  I did  Not even a little walk-on or something 
[02:14:00]  Were you guys not doing anything, though?  You wouldn't go on  You weren't allowed to go on  You wouldn't go on any shows  I was never officially asked  But he might have known that  Because you wouldn't go on radio or anything  You guys were doing no press  I didn't want to do anything  To collect the money  Shit  Yeah, we had to collect that money  Playing video games  Man, did we collect that money  Like a maniac  Fucking shoving it in our back pockets  Oh, yeah  But that's why you guys  That shit was spilling out of our fucking pockets  That was a high and hearty  Fuck you to CBS radio  Oh, was it?  Yes  Goody for you  I want to know 
[02:14:30]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba  Who sings that?  Lydia  Of course  And Jimmy Norton  Jimmy Norton  Happy birthday  Not yet  No, not yet  Not yet  Today's  Tomorrow  That's what I want for my birthday  Is what?  Look at a picture with her  I set it up for your birthday  When it happens, I hope you think  I hope so  I hope so  Can we take a break?  A lot of people singing Jimmy's voice  Is very high in that interview  Oh, yeah.  Now, dude, I was so depressed when we were off the radio. 
[02:15:00]  I didn't know how long it was going to be.  And Tough Crowd had just started, and I was so psyched that we had a fucking—I had a gig.  I remember being kind of happy at that point, like, okay, my career's not over.  Right.  That's something to do.  I had nothing.  I didn't hear the whole interview.  I heard, like, the first—how long is it, Iraq?  I don't remember.  I think it's, like, seven, eight minutes.  14 minutes.  It's 14 minutes.  Okay.  Okay.  Just—I forgot about this, too.  The station, when I brought that back, they were going through it, and they're like,  who gives a fuck about this guy?  Like, every time I'd go down there for Stephen Lynch, you, other comics and stuff, I'd bring 
[02:15:30]  stuff back, and they were like—  And was that the station we ended up being syndicated to?  No, that was—  Oh, okay.  This was a clear channel station down there.  Those fuckers down there just never liked us.  They just did not give a shit about comics.  Oh, ID Comics?  Yeah.  Everybody I tried to get an interview with and got an interview with and brought in,  they were just like, well, who cares about, like, Dave Attell?  Yeah, yeah.  Who cares about you?  Who cares about—  They just never did anything with comics.  Well, they were right.  No one cares about me.  Hey, is that PD in West Palm Beach still there, E-Rock?  That just didn't like us? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, I think he's still there.  Jesus Christ.  Are they doing well?  What was the name of the morning show they had?  Something with Roper?  It's changed again because they added a girl to it, but it was Loper and Smitty.  Oh, remember Loper?  Smitty.  And then Smitty.  A Lopeweiser, right?  Oh, God.  A Lopeweiser.  Yes, that's beer with a little cum on the rim.  A little.  Those guys can't possibly still be on the radio.  I think they are, and they added a girl to it, which most people don't know is Loper's wife.  Oh, boy. 
[02:16:30]  That's going to make the papers down there.  God, radio is fucking terrible.  Regular radio is absolutely abysmal.  I cannot get over how bad—I do it on the road, too.  And some of the shows I do are fun, but it's few and far between that are fun.  Yeah.  Really, yeah, you'll get some.  Like, BJ Shea is a fun show.  It's like the same as I remember doing radio, and fucking—I like doing Rover in Cleveland.  It's got like that fucking—it's kind of still a—same type of a guy's show, but— 
[02:17:00]  For the most part.  Oh, boy.  The name of the show has actually changed to Loper and Randy.  Oh, they got rid of Smitty.  What happened to Smitty?  Randy's his wife.  Oh, God.  I'm going to open up a Lope Wiser.  Oh, no, you're not.  Oh, we talked about it enough.  I think you've had you in your Lope Wisers.  Loper and Randy.  But they're live Loper and Loud.  Why'd they get rid of Smitty?  I don't know.  What happened?  What was Smitty's problem?  I don't know.  Maybe Smitty got tired of it.  Huh?  They wouldn't have me on when I was down there. 
[02:17:30]  Maybe I don't blame them.  After the beating.  All right, we got a break here.  We'll play that interview when we get back.  Yeah, I'd like to hear that.  Absolutely.  I may have to run out during it.  Why?  I don't know.  Has anyone contacted you about your picture this morning?  You're just sitting here hoping that someone's going to come to the door and go,  Okay, Jimmy, it's time.  Is she in the building right now?  I asked Kenny before.  Yes, she should be.  Oh, well.  She should be.  I can't confirm.  Well.  I'll say I do have—I did email somebody. 
[02:18:00]  A lot of paparazzi outside.  And they did email me back.  Yeah, the building's a buzz today.  Oh, oh, oh.  They emailed you back this morning?  Mars see anything?  Yes.  Not Elo.  Oh, Mars has some info.  Oh, Mars.  He was yesterday.  Mars got some info.  It's probably about Fedor.  Mars, you have info?  She's on Howard right now.  She is.  Okay.  Did you see her?  No.  He listens to Howard.  Yeah, why do you listen to Howard?  You're working this show.  You're in the hearing room.  Why bother?  Yeah, man.  Microphone.  We have a camera feed going into the studio. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, do they know about it?  How does she look?  Is she in the bathroom?  She looks like she always does.  Did you see her?  She always looks different.  She wears—she's wearing like a leather fucking—I don't know.  She's sitting now.  She's just wearing—  A leather—  Good job on the radio.  A leather hat.  A leather hat.  A leather arrow through her head like Steve Martin.  A leather Tuscadero.  Did you just say a leather?  It looks like a one-piece leotard.  A one-piece leotard leather thing.  A leather with a—  Can you see camel toe?  With a what? 
[02:19:00]  Can you see camel toe?  No.  How do you know?  She's sitting.  Because she's sitting.  Oh.  Have you seen her live or just on a TV?  She's live on the TV.  What is she singing?  Is she singing?  No, she's just—  Did you see her walking around?  No, sir.  Okay.  She saw it on the TV.  You see that, Danny?  She saw it on the TV.  On the TV.  We've all seen her on the TV.  I want to see what she looks like when she's just walking around.  But he saw her live on the TV.  She's live right now. 
[02:19:30]  Mars, you're fucking hysterical.  That's great.  All right.  We'll break and do something else.  Stay there.  Hello, hello.  Baby, you cold?  I can't hear a thing.  I got no service in the club, you see, see.  What, what, what did you say?  Oh, you're breaking up on me.  Sorry, I can't hear you.  I'm kind of busy.  I'm kind of, kind of busy. 
[02:20:00]  I'm kind of, kind of busy.  I'm kind of—  Sorry, I can't hear you.  I'm kind of busy.  Just a second.  It's my favorite song they're gonna play.  And I can't text you with a drink in my hand, eh.  You should have made some plans with me.  You know that I was free.  And now you won't stop calling me.  I'm kind of busy.  Stop calling, stop calling.  I don't want to think anymore.  I left my head and my heart on the dance floor. 
[02:20:30]  Stop calling, stop calling.  I don't want to talk anymore.  I left my head and my heart on the dance floor.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  Stop telephoning me.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  I'm busy.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  Stop telephoning me.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  You're all you want, but there's no one home.  And you're not gonna reach my telephone.  Cause I'm out of the club and I'm sipping that club. 
[02:21:00]  And you're not gonna reach me on my telephone.  My telephone.  My, my, my, my telephone.  So I'm out of the club, and I'm sipping that club, and you're not going to reach my telephone.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  The number you have reached is not inserted at this time.  Please check the number or try your call again.  Sirius XM.  It's a virus.  Yeah.  It's the Obedienist of the show.  All right.  Lady Gaga is in the building.  Jimmy's going to try to get a picture.  This is the second attempt to get a picture. 
[02:21:30]  Lady Gaga has been here twice now, right?  More than two attempts.  I've tried once when she was in Atlantic City through Clear Channel, but it didn't work.  What's your threat level?  Not Clear Channel, through, I'm sorry, Live Nation.  What's your threat level at if you don't get this picture?  Well, I'm just going to be disappointed.  Are you going to be going to be on the top pissed off?  Oh, update, Kenny.  Gaga update.  I hear there's going to be a wardrobe change before the mashups.  Okay.  And somebody is on the list of things to do. 
[02:22:00]  Somebody's on the list of you to fuck off and die.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your jacket to be fucking colored in a human color.  Isn't that the same suit from Friday?  No, this one has.  No, this is not.  This is the spring collection.  It's called Putrescence.  It's a little more bile color to it.  Is Jimmy officially on a picture-taking list?  Yes.  Ah. 
[02:22:30]  Yes, people are aware.  Okay.  Well.  Did you talk to, who did you talk to?  People on our side or their side?  I spoke to friends of ours.  I trust Kenny.  We have no friends here.  Are they good fellas?  Who's our friends here?  There's people on your side.  Is there a long list of friends?  Not to my knowledge.  Ooh, I want a pop lock.  Taken.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, man.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Jimmy is pop-locking. 
[02:23:00]  He's going to swimwalk all the way to the mashup studio.  Oh.  That would be embarrassing if I was swimwalking and didn't know she was watching.  Is that where the photo will be taking place?  I would say in that general vicinity.  Probably, yeah.  You want me to take the picture instead of Jimmy?  I certainly don't.  I'm really good at the picture.  Oh, my God.  I'm sure you're fine, but I'd prefer to have Kenny doing it.  I'm really good.  Come on.  Both their heads cut off.  Kenny always fumbles with the...  Kenny doesn't understand the fucking...  Of course.  Let me show you.  Those big mitts on that camera.  He always looks at it like it's hieroglyphics. 
[02:23:30]  It's like you use this 500 times.  It's on, and then you've got to flip the flash.  Oh, shit.  I like your older camera better.  This is much better.  Flip the flash is going to fuck him up.  No, it won't.  It's like a two-button.  Just think you're fucking...  You're the two-clicker.  Like a two-clicker.  Like this.  Click.  Click.  And then you click it off.  Click and click.  Can I see that camera?  I can't see it from here.  I'll show it to you later.  Are we doing the flash on or flash off?  Why would I show you how to put the flash on if we were doing a flash off?  Oh, shit.  What purpose would that be?  I'd go flash off.  There's a lot of light in this building. 
[02:24:00]  It's like, who is that?  Lady Gaga?  I can't tell.  The picture's the dark.  You can always take a little bit of brightness out, but if your flash isn't on and it's blurry...  It's the photography key.  Your goose is cooked.  Yeah.  All right.  When is this picture going down?  Soon?  And can we watch the picture being taken?  That's my favorite part.  It's probably going to be after the interview.  I'm guessing it's going to be after the matchup.  Or is it before?  But I'll be over there before.  I think it could happen at any time.  Yeah.  I'll be over there.  You don't want to miss that.  I know.  I get to practice when she walks by real quick with a bunch of people. 
[02:24:30]  Pretend you're her walking by.  Okay.  Hi, Lady Gaga!  Imagine that.  You're going to put your paws up.  What?  You heard me.  Oh, you're going to put your paws up?  You have to put your paws up.  I actually didn't get that.  Oh, stop.  Oh, monsters.  You little monsters and your paws up.  I'm a little monster.  Oh, God.  What does that mean?  I should say, like, everyone says I'm a monster because I molest children in the neighborhood. 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  I've been called a monster.  What is that doing up there?  Wow.  That's on TV?  No, that's not...  Sexnagle did it.  Sexnagle?  Where did you find that?  It's a picture of Lady Gaga with her.  Some celeb site got these Polaroids of some Japanese bondage thing she did.  Well, I'll tell you something.  She's not bad.  I'm not liking the...  The boobies?  Yeah, there's a little gravity problem.  I like that.  Heavy.  Heavy tits.  No, they're not heavy.  Once again, the left one a little bigger than the right one.  A little flapjack.  Oh, Roland's coming in.  Roland's going to joke with me and torture me. 
[02:25:30]  Roland.  You know, she's wrapping up Howard in the menu.  I think she'll be right down there.  Okay.  So I should go over there soon?  She'll be right down there.  Kenny, do you want to let me know?  Yes, sir.  Please?  Roland, can we all go down there?  No.  What about the next picture?  How many pictures are there?  Just keep switching.  I only got two here.  Oh.  I want a picture with the Lady Gaga.  I'll send her in.  All right, why don't we...  Why is there a guy with a yarmulke and a karate gig? 
[02:26:00]  I never want to see those two things.  Oh, he's like a Jewish Kung Fu guy.  Anthony, we got Bobo on the line for something here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bobo, you've been on hold for an hour and 42 minutes.  What's going on, sir?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo.  Yes, I was...  Why would you be on hold for an hour and 42 minutes and then not be there? 
[02:26:30]  Bobo.  Wouldn't you have your phone on speaker at least?  Bobo.  Bobo.  I'm here.  Where were you?  Where were you, you fuck?  No.  I was here.  I had to take the phone off my ear for a second, but...  A second?  That was...  And that ticket did work.  What ticket?  That Met ticket that was ripped, it did work.  What Met's ticket?  I'm confused.  Remember the last time I was there?  No.  About a month ago or so, I think. 
[02:27:00]  What?  No, no, no.  It was just last Friday.  You weren't here last Friday, but anyway, go ahead.  Whatever.  Yeah, I was.  Remember the ticket?  No.  What ticket?  For the Mets game?  Yeah.  I don't remember no ticket for the Mets game.  Sorry.  You remember it, all right?  I don't remember, Bobo.  Why would I say that?  What are you talking about?  If I remembered, I would tell you, yeah, I remember.  That's funny.  I remember being...  That's just funny.  I remember being there last Friday. 
[02:27:30]  You sure you weren't dreaming of this?  Because you certainly weren't in studio last Friday, sir.  I was.  Prove it.  I was.  I still got...  I still got...  I got the...  I still got the whole...  The visitor's pass from last...  The dated.  Oh, yeah.  You're lying, man.  I got it.  I got the...  You're lying, stupid.  Bobo, you do realize you're lying.  It must have been a dream or something.  We did not have you in last Friday. 
[02:28:00]  We were off, stupid.  I got the visitor's pass and dated.  Anyone could have a visitor's pass and put a date on it, stupid?  Maybe you were in the building.  No, no.  It was one from the building.  Whatever.  What do you got, man?  Because I don't remember at all.  I remember that ticket that you tricked me into ripping.  What ticket are you talking about?  I didn't...  And I tricked you into ripping it. 
[02:28:30]  Why would you rip up a ticket that's yours?  What are you talking about?  You're a fool.  I don't know.  With some folded paper, I don't know.  You're babbling.  You're just babbling.  You're a big selfish fool.  Wait, so I made you rip up a piece of folded paper and that somehow was the ticket?  That doesn't make sense.  Bobo, I didn't know it was wrapped in the paper.  Why would you rip your ticket up, Bobo?  What?  Well, I didn't know the ticket was in there and it was wrapped in... 
[02:29:00]  Bobo.  That the paper would...  Answer me this.  Bobo, answer me this.  Is there a possibility you were dreaming and you weren't here Friday?  Let's be honest with each other for a second.  Because I have no recollection of this whatsoever.  Oh, I was.  I still got the thing.  I could easily run it through the scanner and post it on the internet.  How is one person gullible? 
[02:29:30]  Every time.  Why can't I come back?  Fifty times.  I can fall for it.  You weren't here.  I was.  Yes, I did too.  The one that was ripped.  The one that was ripped.  The biggie did.  Amazing.  Your capacity for deception.  I'm amazed.  We have a movie titled Deception starring Bobo. 
[02:30:00]  Deception.  Bobo.  Yeah.  We really don't think you were here Friday.  Yeah.  I think you got your days and what happened and all that all mixed up.  Yep.  No, I was.  Your ability to be deceived is uncanny.  I was there.  It is enraging.  I was there.  I got...  Bobo.  Prove that you were here Friday.  That's all we ask.  Go ahead.  Prove it.  I was there. 
[02:30:30]  I remember seeing that chick with the huge pits that day.  That's E-Rock.  Damn it.  Sorry.  I just got an E.  I'm sorry.  I just got an E out.  I know you did.  God damn it.  We tripped over the dash in the middle.  Bobo, I have to tell you, we haven't had a woman in this studio in a long time, so I  don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  I was there last Friday.  I got proof.  I also got a receipt that I put money on a MetroCard that day. 
[02:31:00]  So?  You could have gone anywhere.  No, but the receipt specifically says...  Do you have any comprehension of patterns of behavior?  It's like, if people do the same thing to you every time, how do you buy into it every  time?  I don't comprehend it.  I was there.  Every fucking time.  There was security.  He's just trampling through.  It's amazing. 
[02:31:30]  Bobo, I'm telling you right now, I don't remember you being in Studio Friday.  I'm sorry.  Somehow prove it.  Yeah.  Or continue to give literal responses.  Continue to give a literal response.  I was.  I was.  Of course you were.  We understand that.  Now say it again.  And again.  And again.  I was there.  I know you were.  And again. 
[02:32:00]  One more time.  And again.  I don't have a copy of yours.  And again.  I don't have a copy of the thing.  What?  But I got the thing.  It was rain.  I got it.  We heard you.  All right, Bobo, answer this.  Why were you here on Friday?  I don't think you were.  But if you were here, why were you here on Friday?  Now, I remember calling in saying that I wasn't on the Couch of Zilch's last Friday.  And then you said, fine, come in.  And I made it there within an hour.  We didn't do Couch of Zilch's this past Friday.  We took a break from that.  Because we don't want to do it every Friday. 
[02:32:30]  It'll burn out the bit.  Unlike Bobo.  That never gets burned.  Yeah.  I remember you guys doing that, all right?  Well, your memory is fucked up, Bobo.  Oh, Bobo, I got proof.  Proof of what?  What's your proof?  Then give us proof.  Proof of what?  Being here?  Go ahead.  Prove it to us.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I said, well, it's not proof that I could prove again.  I said what was around when I was there. 
[02:33:00]  Do you ever learn from past experience?  How do you remember where to put food?  Like, when you have a steak, do you take a piece and jam it into your cheek and your ear?  Or does memory cause you to put it into your mouth?  Because that's where food goes.  How do you never learn from past experience?  How are you an untrainable dog?  Timmy, will you be quiet for a second?  I'm talking to Bobo.  Bobo.  Okay, my apologies.  You're trying to tell us that you were here Friday. 
[02:33:30]  Me and Anthony, very confused.  Jimmy's not confused because he wasn't here.  He was in L.A.  So, what is this all about?  Why are you trying to make believe you were here Friday?  We're really confused.  No, I remember actually.  You were here in the past.  You had to take the thing.  We know the couch is zilch.  You just keep in redundancy.  Redundancy.  Redundancy.  I remember.  We know.  We remember.  Nothing stops him either on a roll.  Nothing.  I remember being there. 
[02:34:00]  Just keep saying I remember again.  But, see, Jimmy's making a good point.  You can't just say I remember being there.  That's what I'm trying to say.  If you saw the movie Inception, what is reality?  I'm starting to think that you might have dreamt this.  Where were you, and prove where you were.  Go.  All right.  I was in the studio Friday around 8.30.  Prove it. 
[02:34:30]  I got proof because I still got the visitor's pass from that day.  I also got the receipt from the train station from around that time.  When I put money in the MetroCard, I also remember correctly that Sam wasn't there last Friday.  Yes, I was.  Sam was here.  He was.  Sam's right here.  Sam's not a lot of take days off.  Sam hasn't had a day off in three weeks.  Yeah, I was here.  I did the after show.  That's funny.  I didn't see you the whole time.  I was here. 
[02:35:00]  I hosted the after show.  Yeah, well, we didn't see you either, so.  No, no, you weren't there.  Bobo, why are you lying to us?  This is really a little weird.  You know, lying to us.  Shut up a minute.  Lying to us will keep you from ever being on the show.  In all fairness, if you don't prove that you were here Friday in a lickety split here or whatever,  we're going to have to ban you from the show.  You've got to be banned for lying.  I still got the ripped ticket.  What's a ripped ticket? 
[02:35:30]  What's a ripped ticket?  I know what a retart is, but I don't know what a reticket is.  No, the ticket.  I know, literal.  A gag is just literal.  What do you like about this show?  Do you think this is fucking political talk?  How do you not get the humor on this show ever?  I've never seen him laugh on this show.  I know.  Never.  But he hasn't missed an episode.  I know you guys are trying to mess with me, all right, right now.  Oh, come on, you.  Stop catching on three days later.  I was there.  I think we've got to ban him from the show. 
[02:36:00]  I think you're lying.  I think we've got to ban you from the show for lying to the show.  We don't like people lying on the show.  Should we hang up on them?  No, no, no.  I'm not one.  Bobo, say it.  Say the words.  He hung up.  Not me.  Oh, boy.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Can we hear that real quick?  I love that one.  Bobo.  Angry Bobo.  Fuck you. 
[02:36:30]  He's so mad right there.  I love Jimmy's take on that.  Come on.  What are you doing?  It's a comedy show.  It's the same thing every time.  Starter Patty is the same way, too.  She's like a hardcore listener.  Bobo, hardcore listener.  But you're right.  I've never heard either one of those two laugh at anything.  No.  They don't laugh at anything.  Why are you listening to the show?  How do you just make that stupid palsy face?  The fucking...  It looks like she's getting electroshock therapy.  Yeah.  Very funny, Anthony.  Oh, why not? 
[02:37:00]  Like when De Niro's trying to do arts and crafts in that fucking...  Oh, God.  In Awakenings.  Awakenings.  When he's a trip trapping all over the fucking place.  Jive walking.  When they're all...  The medicine works for all of them, and then he's like clumping all over, bumming the whole place out.  Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.  Who do you think you're fooling?  You're dropping dishes and desserts.  Stop hanging.  You can't even put the house together.  Dumb house.  Yeah.  Yuck, yuck.  Stupid Patty.  Yes.  Where are we at with Lady Gaga? 
[02:37:30]  It's kind of...  She might be doing a wardrobe change or...  Oh, shit.  Wardrobe change for fucking radio.  That's the beauty of her.  She's a performance artist, and that's something you forget a lot.  Is she?  Yes.  Is she really?  Hey, we got a woman that was celebrating power outage, the end of a power outage in Detroit.  Oh, the day?  Was it cold in the day?  I think it's hot in the day.  We were so busy last week, we never got to this clip, and it's fantastic.  I do want to play the sex bagel Jim Norton thing, but Jim might be leaving at any second 
[02:38:00]  to get a Lady Gaga.  I'm going to run out.  Oh, yeah.  You got to wait by the door.  Yeah, I'll wait.  Give us constant reports.  Jimmy, can you take me with you for the Lady Gaga picture?  No.  I think I'll get it, but I'm not even...  Do you kind of want one picture with her, right?  Do you?  Do I?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not going to bullshit.  That's a biggie.  I'm just hoping Jimmy's eyes are closed in this picture.  Oh, no.  I never look good, though. 
[02:38:30]  It's like, there's really not much I can...  What if her eyes are closed?  It's fine.  I wouldn't blame her.  If I was staying next to me, I'd do the same thing.  I know a Photoshop guy that could open those fucking eyes for you.  Oh, God.  He'll open them nice and wide.  I'll take a happy picture, though.  Yeah.  Here's this clip from Detroit.  It's a way in Delray, Southwest Detroit.  DTE crews did a power push and got the lights back on about 8 o'clock Wednesday night.  Delray's been dark for five days.  How's it feel to get the power restored?  It's been five days, hasn't it?  What?  It's eight. 
[02:39:00]  I'm so glad the power comes back on because I was burning up.  LaMasa Pace said she was thrilled to see all the power trucks rolling down her  street, South Military.  The whole street was lined up with them cherry pickers and all them crew.  I said...  You said, hallelujah.  I'm going to lay hot, dog.  Look at that.  Boy, look at that thing.  And five long, hot days and nights.  After Saturday's storm, Delray has power for the first time.  How are you to sleep tonight?  You bet I'm going to sleep like a baby. 
[02:39:30]  Drink me some good old Kool-Aid and drink me some big jug of ice or Kool-Aid and go to sleep  like a baby.  Holy shit.  Jimmy's just throwing his arms.  I'm like...  No, I'm just...  It's great.  It really is good to live in a white neighborhood.  Yeah, exactly.  Because that would never happen in a white neighborhood, right?  Five days?  Get the fuck out of here.  I don't think you'd get the same quotes.  Tell you the truth.  Drink a big old glass of ice, Kool-Aid, and go to sleep. 
[02:40:00]  We got black people problems and white people problems.  That's black people problems.  That's black people problems.  I've never gone five days without fucking heat or A.C.  They had them cherry picker things.  That's not true, though, man.  When I was growing up, we had one fan.  My fucking father.  Or was it my sheep mother?  Yeah, no shit.  We had one fan that we'd rotate in the house and take turns.  Oh, that one.  Why couldn't they buy a few fans?  Oscillating fan. 
[02:40:30]  How poor were we?  Pretty poor, apparently so, huh?  And then my wife sees where I grew up.  She goes, you weren't poor at all.  I go, you know what?  You're probably right.  We're holding out on you, you think?  My mom was, because she was always scared that we were going to run out of money and  be on the street.  You probably could have had air conditioning.  Never mind a fan.  We didn't have air conditioning in our house.  So you probably could have.  We had two fans, honestly.  One for mommy and daddy, and then the other one we took turns using.  Was she cheap?  Yes!  Skin flint. 
[02:41:00]  The worst.  Because my chicks, like, I've been telling her for years how poor I was growing up, and  then she's kind of seen the town I lived in, the house I lived in.  She's like, what are you fucking talking about?  I'm like, I'm telling you.  Oh, everybody always thought, like, oh, Centiport, ooh.  We had no frills, shit, all white boxes growing up.  I like that.  All hand-me-down clothes.  That's what I fucking go for these days.  Sneakers with holes in them, one pair of sneakers a year for a growing kid. 
[02:41:30]  One haircut a year.  One haircut a year?  Yeah, we went from having really long hair.  At the end of the year, it must have been great.  Little Moppet's running around.  It was depressing as all hell, because we'd go down to a Jim Norton cut from having long hair.  Ah, wow.  That was weird, man.  Shave it all off, eh?  And then it would grow the entire year.  Where are we at with the Lady Gaga picture?  No, we're still doing the show.  She's just, uh...  Kenny's just staring down the hall.  Oh, is he?  No, he's not.  That's his job.  I'm just going to stare down the hallway.  But isn't he going to be... 
[02:42:00]  Why isn't he at the end of the hall so I know when she's coming?  Well, why don't you ask him?  He's right outside the door.  He'll have an answer for you.  Kenny, where are we at with this whole thing?  I have an undercover operative down the end of the hall.  You do?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Kenny's there.  And then they got...  I should have known.  Contact you?  Yeah.  What's the signal?  It's the high sign.  It should be 30 jumping jacks.  30?  27 means no go.  Oh, that was 27.  Nope.  That's...  Yeah.  Tippy toe. 
[02:42:30]  Okay.  She's still in the house?  She's still in the house.  She has to decompress.  What?  In between interviews.  Get the fuck out of here.  Are you kidding?  I hate these people.  They're not real people.  That's just Kenny saying that.  Oh, okay.  She's still on the couch.  What couch?  What couch?  Howard's couch.  Oh, you call it on the couch?  What are you?  You know all the slang for the show and everything.  What are you, the insiders?  On the couch.  Are you a spy for those guys?  She's still on the couch. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Wish I was.  Home.  Sleeping.  Soon enough.  Ah, yeah.  Who's on our hotline?  I don't...  Hotline.  I can't pick them up because they now are talking to this person.  Ah, the phone.  Troy!  Who's on the hotline?  Oh, okay.  Jay Moores!  Jay Moores.  ¿Qué pasó, mijo?  ¿Cómo estás?  Bien, bien.  We got Lady Gaga in the house, and Jimmy's going to be leaving to take a picture with Lady Gaga.  Is she covered in meat? 
[02:43:30]  I'm wondering why...  Well, I don't think you can wear meat in the summertime.  That's a little close.  Is meat a wintertime...  Is it a fall-spring outfit?  You look silly wearing meat before Labor Day, is what they say.  Yeah.  You don't want to look like a jerk wearing meat.  That's only two ounces.  Oh, shit.  Drug deals.  Actually, my bag's going through...  All right.  Three times a charm.  My bag's going through the X-Air Machine three times because I travel with Cologne. 
[02:44:00]  It's another stinky fucking Romanian like everybody else at this airport.  Wait.  You got to go through the machine three times?  Yeah.  They just keep that being out.  And I had my captain's badge that Billy Mac gave me.  You know, I display it on top like a creep.  Yes, of course.  Let me take my badge.  You probably recognize me from my police work.  Yes, Jay Moore.  And his police work.  Citizen's arrest.  You're familiar.  I'm like, well, I don't know if you sound like Captain's badge.  You know, many collars.  Many, many collars. 
[02:44:30]  What the hell is the problem?  What have they taken out of your bag so far?  My toothpaste was too big, and now they're running it again.  Honestly.  Enough already with this shit.  It's been ten years.  Enough.  I'm going to brush your teeth, motherfucker.  Don't make me.  Yeah, don't make me.  What's wrong with toothpaste?  You could be plastic explosives in there or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I am.  How about you?  Well, that's your thing mine is.  Yeah, yeah.  See that?  Well, that's great to see.  I'm sweating my balls off right now, hoping they just give me my shit back.  How are we doing on the Honeymore Cologne? 
[02:45:00]  We good?  I have no offense.  Japanese guy right in front of me.  Check it out.  That's all.  All right.  Thank you, sir, very much.  I appreciate it.  Are you done?  I appreciate it.  I can't even talk.  Yeah, I do a lot of arrests.  That's thing.  Probably recognize me from my police work.  What do you laugh about, Japanese guy?  You got your shoes on?  I do.  But I start taking them off like at the curb.  I'm like George Clooney up in the air.  Hey, Jimmy, how's the Antisocial Tour going, my man? 
[02:45:30]  I don't know yet.  We're done for the summer.  We may start up in...  You should start up.  September.  We'll have to see what everybody's doing.  Oh, good point.  I saw the billboard for you guys.  I was doing the Hockey Awards, and I saw your giant billboard in Vegas.  I got all fired up.  Yeah.  Like every comic I love was on that show.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, it was a great show, man.  Fucking me, Bill, Dave, and Brewer.  I think Brewer's in Europe right now doing...  He is in Europe.  ...something for OzFest.  Shut up!  Hey, I was at Starbucks this morning. 
[02:46:00]  Have you guys noticed this new anal-retentive douchebag that wants his coffee 120 degrees?  Have you ran into this guy?  No, not yet.  Really?  I swear to God, not yet.  Jimmy, you love your...  Where's my coffee diva?  I've never noticed the temperature, though.  To me, the temperature's always just so.  Yeah.  What better way to let the rest of Starbucks know you have no control at any other aspect  in your life whatsoever when you're walking around a Mexican barista with a hole through 
[02:46:30]  his lip?  Do me a favor.  No, not you.  Not the white...  Hey, Pocahontas.  You gave me 215 last time.  202 and extra foam.  I felt like George Carlin.  I'm like, you're paying for foam?  Foam.  Where do the aliens come down and see all the neat things we've done?  Like, pay for fucking foam.  You know who, like, seatbelts his extra foam into his car and sticks his finger in and  sucks it like a queer? 
[02:47:00]  Fuck.  It is amazing, like, Starbucks, no matter how long the line is, they keep that shit moving.  It's like, they're like the Federal Express of coffee.  They're like, what do you got?  Non-cap, D-K, yeah, yeah, got it.  What's your name?  Move it along.  Who's that asshole?  You, looking down at your phone.  What do you got?  You pull up in your car.  They just hand you a venti coffee.  You're like, what do you know to you?  You were here a year ago.  I remember your face.  Come on, get out of here.  Move it.  I fucking hate the barista, whatever, that fucking knows the orders ahead of time. 
[02:47:30]  I hate that guy.  Why do you hate it?  It's always faster, though.  Yeah, but fuck, why are you paying that much attention?  Your job sucks.  Well, what else is he going to do?  He smells like coffee.  See, you know, it really is like, at first they were like hipster douchebags, and then  they've morphed into like the best looking people America has to offer.  The baristas, like, even though they got giant holes in their face, they really are the coolest  people in town. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Hey, Jay.  That's my coffee chunk.  Thanks a lot.  You guys have been great.  I like the coffee chunk.  Jay, I wanted to ask this question to these guys, but I'm doing radio with two guys that  don't necessarily like Led Zeppelin.  Here's the questions, very quick.  Led Zeppelin four or Led Zeppelin three?  That's a tough one.  He kind of, he, now, you know I'm a weird guy, O.P., and you know I'm a list bully. 
[02:48:30]  So, I'm going to say three, only but, let me, let me, let me.  Correct answer, sir.  Correct answer.  Only by default, because I wore four out as a team.  Right.  I would say Zofo.  And I never need to hear Stairway to Heaven ever again, and Battle of Evermore, I go,  this is retarded.  Yeah.  Like you're playing a fucking mandolin, singing about battles between goblins and gnomes.  Yeah, that's a bit much.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, what are they doing? 
[02:49:00]  All of a sudden, everybody's gobbling up their food or something, right?  I'd pick three over four.  No, Chip, you're incorrigible, Chip.  Oh, he really is.  Jay, Jay, your podcast is really getting momentum there, as they call it, momentum.  Podcast number one.  Yes, more stories.  How do we get that on our channel?  I debuted on number one, and I was all excited, and they said Kevin Smith took me under his wing.  Yeah.  He's the Suge Knight of podcasts.  He really is.  I just hope that I'm Snoop and not corrupt. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, he's going to, at some point, Kevin's going to hang you out a window by your ankles  and start shaking you down for money.  But I was super excited.  Yeah, I hope so.  At his house, he hangs you out the window.  He drops you into a fancy pool.  Yes.  The thing with Kevin was, you know, on my Twitter feed, I was begging people to, like, figure  out to get me on a podcast.  And everybody's like, have you tried Corolla?  I'm like, no, I don't want to be on a podcast, stupid. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  I want my own podcast.  And Kevin just entered the call, and I said, I don't know anything about electronics or anything.  He goes, don't worry.  I'll send a guy to your house Saturday.  Just, just, it's all we need is content.  And I'm like, it's the perfect scenario.  It's free, so you can subscribe to it.  I never stop talking.  And all Kevin wants is extra content.  I'm like, this is amazing.  People download me talking, and I never shut up.  How long is your podcast? 
[02:50:30]  Each one's about an hour and a half.  Okay.  Last week, we had almost a two.  Yeah, but how many do it for four hours?  Huh?  No, I'm sorry.  That's how much you should do is an hour and a half.  This four-hour shit is stupid.  It's for the birds, I say.  It's for the birds.  For the birds.  Go ahead.  Sorry, Joe.  I like doing five hours, man.  I really do.  I honestly do.  Anthony, I bet the four-hour podcast goes the way of the dodo.  I betcha.  Endangered. 
[02:51:00]  Endangered.  But I was super happy, because I wasn't number one in comedy.  I was like the number one podcast.  Like, I was beating national public radio and, like, how things work.  Like, weird stuff I was beating.  People, from what I've read on Twitter, say it's hilarious.  They love it.  How many people are listening to it?  Do you get those numbers or no?  I don't have them yet.  They're getting them for me.  But I just know that it comes out, you know, we did, two have been up so far, and they both 
[02:51:30]  just come out at number one.  And then they stay number one for about three days.  They drop to three.  And then, I think yesterday, I was number two and number five still.  First two.  And the one, I got my first double album open.  I got my first Exile on Main Street podcast.  I was in my garage with Barry Katz.  Hey, ma'am.  Just talking about Last Comic Standing and how it can't be fixed.  Right.  And going through all that.  And then my wife came in and broke down how Bobcat apparently has been, like, making the rounds. 
[02:52:00]  And on stage saying that she dumped him for me, which is, like, revisionist history.  So, once and for all, my wife went on the podcast and broke down exactly how he broke up with her.  But, like, nice.  Like, nobody said anything bad about the guy, but I thought that was salient.  Why does he still care about you two?  Because he's a self-saboteur.  And if he admits that he broke up with her, he'd probably hang himself like David Carradine in the Philippines. 
[02:52:30]  Hey, where are you flying to, by the way?  Jimmy's had breakfast with my wife.  She's pretty delightful.  She is very nice.  She's very nice.  That's the kind of girl you cut loose.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, she's very sweet.  When you're, you know, when you realize you marry up, you've got to hang out to that.  Yes, you do.  I am in St. Louis.  I did a gig last night for the veterinary medical, I don't know the exact acronym, but it was for vets. 
[02:53:00]  Corporate genes.  Nice.  2,000 veterinarians that want a fucking party.  Were they fun?  They were fun.  I can't do corporates.  I'm too dirty.  I know.  I had to redo my whole life just because I realized I was leaving that much money on the table.  But look at you, Mr. Antisocial.  You cut out your own niche, Jimmy.  You're killing everyone around you, Leon.  Yeah.  You're not dying, Jimmy.  You're just linking up with other people who are.  Fucking four of us.  Jimmy's favorite impression of mine will always be Chris Sarandon from Dog Day. 
[02:53:30]  It really is the beginning, middle, and end of impersonations as Chris Sarandon.  We were doing everything.  Uppers, downers, screamers, blues.  Screamers.  What do you want?  I took a bunch of pills to get away from you, and now I'm going to go away on a vacation with you?  He's the greatest.  Oh, my God.  His hair.  He's the best part of the movie.  Yeah, he really is.  And the cops snickering behind him.  Yeah.  They're all laughing.  Oh, you guys are the best.  I miss you guys, man.  Yeah.  When are you going to be in New York, man? 
[02:54:00]  God damn it.  You've got to come by and say hi.  Hell yeah.  Everybody said something similar at once.  It was all similar at once.  It was all the same shit.  Come by and say hi.  Come by, God damn it.  Hey.  God damn you.  Oh, and let me set the record straight right now.  Yes, sir.  I adore Louis C.K., one of my all-time favorite comics.  Yeah.  My impression of Louis and Ricky Gervais was to do impressions of Ricky and Louis and point out the uncomfortability that I personally felt because I'm a fucking blabbermouth and like to be the center of attention. 
[02:54:30]  And my point was that it was a very odd room.  When Ron Bennington, Jimmy, me, and Opie can't land the joke, that's a tiny, tiny runway.  Yeah.  I've been rooting around that people are like, yeah, obviously he's jealous.  He's got a problem.  No, he's my favorite comic.  Those two are part everything.  Everyone picks apart everything.  Those two had a chemistry going that day. 
[02:55:00]  We were pretty much spectators.  They're friends.  We were spectators that day for the most part.  It was fun.  Opie, you're obviously jealous.  Louie and his talents are the way you would have said that.  Yeah.  Same.  Well, I'm so surprised that our listeners would actually spin something.  That's crazy, Jay.  See, the difference is I'm used to not being on the radar of celebrities.  You get used to that after a while.  Jay?  Yes, sir?  In My Time of Dying or Cashmere? 
[02:55:30]  In My Time of Dying.  Not even close.  Thank you.  We're on the same fucking page today.  However, oh, by the way, Opie, you'll love this.  My podcast starts with Unchained.  Shove it up a big truck's ass every week.  That was one of the...  It was Herman Edwards saying, put your name on it, because I'm obsessed with being heckled  by people on the...  You know, Corvette I-14 tells you you suck.  I got to tell you, that was...  That...  I wish Anthony was here that day. 
[02:56:00]  That was one of my funnest breaks of the entire year.  I was on a cruise.  I wish I was here.  You're destroying Eddie Trunk's book, because he would make these lists and leave off key  songs.  Yeah, he had the Iron Maiden list, and he left off Run to the Hills and 666.  Yeah, both of them.  And I'm like, you're being too cool for the room.  No one does that.  I did hear that.  You did?  I heard it on a replay or something, but I did hear that.  And then he does it like Unchained by Van Halen.  I'm like, what's wrong with you?  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  And then all I said to Opie, they said, have you rock, just play it.  Just play the opening 15 seconds, and as soon as the guitar kicks in,  everyone looks around smiling, and then Eddie just slowly began to weep like the  crying Indian in the literature.  I like that reference because it's current.  Yes, it's very current.  That Indian hasn't shed a tear in 30 fucking years.  No, he's too busy making money at a casino somewhere.  He's running a casino, and there's cash by his feet.  Giant fucking bags of money are flying out a window at his feet. 
[02:57:00]  It's like garbage.  It's dollar bills.  Did you say giant eggs of money?  Eggs or bags.  However you heard it, Jay, that's all that matters.  Hey, Jay, you got anything on the women's soccer?  Because I know you do sports, and I know you fill in for Jim Rome a lot.  It's very difficult to beat radioactive women.  We were all rooting for Sweden because, let's face it, when they went into their celebratory  pile, it was like about 40 masturbations. 
[02:57:30]  I mean, that was really crazy.  You know they were lezen out in that pile.  Swedes.  I hope so.  How about, you know, it's funny.  They were like complete toehead blondes, and there was like that one brunette, and you  go, whoa, whoa, who's this one now?  Who's the brunette Swedish girl?  I don't know.  They made you.  Wow.  Let's talk.  And then you get the Japanese, and it's like, well, do you want to beat the hot chicks or  the radioactive chicks?  Yeah.  I'm surprised one of them didn't, like, just quadruple in size and just start eating 
[02:58:00]  people.  Where are you at with soccer, though?  You think it's exciting?  They try to tell us how exciting soccer is.  I don't get it.  I watch, like, Manchester United sometimes on ESPN 11.  Yeah.  And only because the crowd is so insane that I think to myself, well, this must be cool.  And I like watching it for a little bit, and I like listening to the announcers.  I think they're funny because I don't know what they're saying.  But here's my take on soccer.  It ends, a soccer game's 2-0 or 3-2. 
[02:58:30]  If there was no goalies, it'd be 9-8.  Wow.  Good fucking point.  Yeah, motherfucker.  That's a really good point.  How many saves per game?  There's no more.  I'm going to fuck everybody up.  I'm going to get arrested in this airport, god damn it.  I think if the soccer field was smaller, I would get into it.  Like a Chelsea period, you just want those sweaty, uncircumcised Euros crashing into the  wall.  Yeah, that's right.  Exactly.  I know exactly what Opie likes. 
[02:59:00]  Now, what, are you just waiting for your god damn plane there in one of those uncomfortable  seats?  Or are you in the big lounge?  No, I don't go to the lounge.  It's for fucking alcoholics.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm always in the lounge.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  Anthony's in the Apple Club.  Excuse me.  How the bloody marriage is for you.  Why am I paying for oatmeal?  Oh, by the way, Colin's Twitter feed the last week has been one of the funniest things I've 
[02:59:30]  ever read in my life.  He's hilarious.  He will not break that character.  When he says, if I get nominated for him, I'm going to spin kick it out of the presenter's  hand.  And then my congratulatory speech, I'm going to go, whatever, Trevor.  Then we're right to Grave Street.  Who that?  Who's the guy who won this?  You know who, homie?  Is it possible Colin can get nominated, or is that done? 
[03:00:00]  I think he is nominated.  Colin got nominated?  Yeah, I think so.  I like that you guys are close.  No, I saw Colin Saturday.  I just, you guys aren't talking about the basics?  I thought he tweeted that he was nominated.  Oh, I didn't, uh...  And he had a whole page of tweets about the humble brag, like, oh, you know, it must have  been a slow, uh, it must have been a slow year.  I was nominated?  Oh, good.  For what?  Best stand-up, obviously?  Uh, outstanding writing for a variety of music or comedy special.  Outstanding writing.  Good for him. 
[03:00:30]  Whose voice was that?  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  Doug Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Hi, Jay.  What was better...  Take him to the zoo, Rock.  Sam spent the weekend in Provincetown.  Of course he did.  Oh, wow.  And it was Bear Week.  I didn't realize.  Was it Bear Weekend or Bear Week?  Bear Week.  Bear Week.  Wow.  Sam had his asshole treated like an oil derrick.  Yes, sir.  Non-stop.  Non-stop.  Thar he blows.  Sam, have you listened to my podcast? 
[03:01:00]  Not yet, but I'm going to today, both episodes.  That's what I love about podcasts.  You can just catch up and have two episodes right there.  How do I download this shit?  It's on the Smodcast website.  Or on iTunes.  Someone give me a fucking burn of this.  I'll burn this shit right now.  I can't believe it's free.  I can't really listen to it because it's...  Jimmy, can you listen to your show back?  Stand-up, you mean?  I'll listen to stand-up once in a while if I'm referencing.  If I want to see how I did a joke.  But in front of people, I never can. 
[03:01:30]  But you'll just listen to that part.  You can't listen to an hour, right?  Nah, I try not to.  I listened to an interview I did a few years ago with E-Rock,  and I have such self-hatred for my voice and my fucking delivery and my inflection.  It's just enraging.  Jay, can we get your podcast on our channel?  I don't know how that works.  You've got to talk to Kay Smith, man.  You've got to talk to Shug.  You've got to talk to Shug.  Well, Kay Smith fucking is on our channel.  You've got to push that right next to me, really?  I mean, there's a whole fucking airport right next to me.  You've got to push all that shit. 
[03:02:00]  Don't you know I'm on the phone with?  What?  Brooks and Dunn, dude.  Come on.  What's happening?  So how do I get just some guy pushing, like, 40 bags?  Well, we've got Kevin Smith's podcast on our channel.  What do you mean on your channel?  Like on 202 or 190?  Yeah, on the weekends, it's like the best of Kevin Smith or whatever.  Bro, that would be tight as hell if you get more stories out.  Oh, shit, man.  That would be cool as fuck, especially if you don't want any money.  It's an easy one.  If you don't want any money, right?  I don't want any. 
[03:02:30]  You know, all I want is more people.  At the shows.  Yeah.  That's all I care about.  Yeah, that makes sense.  That's all I'd like to hear about at potheads.  All right.  Potheads.  Where's Bladder?  Where did Kevin Smith...  Where was that from, Anthony?  What did I just do?  That was Platoon, man.  Barnes.  Y'all talking about killing?  Barnes.  I'd like to hear about it, potheads.  Does Kevin Smith own you, sir?  Well, no paperwork has been filed.  All right.  We can get you on, then.  Yeah.  It could be good for his Smodcastle or whatever. 
[03:03:00]  I believe I'm, you know, and this is in all respect to the Shug Knight that is Kevin Smith.  I don't see anybody else on Smodcastle.  Number the motherfucking one.  What's up?  Motherfucking one.  Yeah.  Shit.  Y'all love life.  Y'all want to kick ass.  Six of you boys.  I'm here all about my lonesome.  We were just talking about what a great character.  Anthony, here's the thing in Platoon.  He really wanted them to kill him, don't you think?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, right then and there.  It took me like ten viewings to realize, oh my God, he really, he wasn't picking a fight.  Please, someone slip my throat and get me out of this.  He'd really had it with life.  And that's why he cries.  He goes, ah, shit, I don't owe you.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, why don't you fucking kill me, you bastards?  Don't do it, Barnes, LBJ.  20 years climbing the fucking walls.  Shit, that's fantastic.  You'll be really happy.  The last four minutes of that conversation was at a urinal with Koreans on the other side of me. 
[03:04:00]  They're like, what the fuck?  I'm like, don't worry.  I went on.  It's the island, not the peninsula.  Relax.  Actually, no.  How's the peninsula?  How's the fatherhood doing, man?  It's good.  I have, my wife has this annoying habit whenever he cries, she picks him up to comfort him.  No.  I have a different tact.  I put him in his car seat and I just put him in the bathroom and leave him there.  It works. 
[03:04:30]  Like, I can't, like, I can't make you fart.  I don't know what to do.  So, my wife says, you can't do that.  That's like almost abuse.  And I said, well, the seat is designed to withstand a fucking car accident.  And I don't think it's going to hurt him being next to the tub at a Ramada.  Unless Patrice shows up and turns the hotel upside down and shakes it like the gorilla in the Samsonite commercial.  What the fuck?  Oh, shit.  We actually did a little research and realized it was American Tourister. 
[03:05:00]  Really?  Yes.  All these years.  You know, it's too bad because Samsonite, we are all wordsmiths a bit.  Yeah.  Samsonite is way better on the mouth.  It really does work better than American Tourister.  And no one knows what American Tourister is anymore.  So, just stick with Samsonite.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Or I'll work in Toomey.  But why does everyone say Samsonite, then?  I don't know.  Where did that start?  They just thought luggage and thought Samsonite, but it's always been American Tourister was the bag that the gorilla threw around. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, Don Draper would be rolling around in his grave, Anthony.  Don Draper?  Yeah.  It's American Tourister.  People see American Tourister, but they're thinking Samsonite.  Oh.  Those are the good old days.  You slap your secretary on the ass, tell her, job well done.  And she goes, who, Mr. Draper?  The good old days.  How much urine would be all over Jimmy's body if he was a businessman in the 50s?  Oh.  Well, you could just do anything to those women. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  No lawsuits.  PM here, you're fired.  They were happy to just have their jobs.  Yeah.  So, I just called.  I missed you guys.  I called earlier.  I called a couple weeks ago, right when Casey Anthony, that was happening.  But you guys were obviously in the middle of it.  I wasn't.  Oh, yes.  I called it, by the way, right from the beginning.  You sure did.  Right from the get-go.  How long before she's at your house, Anthony?  I'm working on it.  As we speak, working on it.  I really think she needs a, they said she needs a safe house somewhere.  Do you have any real angles on this, Ant? 
[03:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  I've been scoping it out.  Isn't she in Columbus today?  Trying to find things.  There's certain places that they think she's with a, not distant family member, but kind  of separated family member.  Right.  In Ohio.  She's going to get a million dollars for her first interview.  Jesus.  And, well, you know.  Anthony says, I'll give you $4 and a million inches of cock.  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  I'm like, kick.  Come on in.  Who doesn't want to spend the rest of the summer hanging out by the pool, you know?  Even though, you know. 
[03:07:00]  I want to be with Jimmy in the hot tub drinking bottled water looking at a slug.  That was what I did.  That was pretty much it.  It was a slug, and the slug and I both just looked at each other and shrugged and then  turned away.  I hear you.  All right.  I'm boarding.  I got to go.  See you, buddy.  All right.  Jay Moore podcast.  Where do we go for the more stories?  You can get it on iTunes.  Just iTunes.  More stories on iTunes.  All right.  Have a good flight, Jay.  Have a good week.  Love you.  Bye, Jay.  See you, buddy.  Jay Moore.  It was Jay.  Jay Moore.  Funny guy, man.  You can also find it on the Smodcast.com website if you don't use iTunes. 
[03:07:30]  Thank you.  Thank you for that, Sam.  Colin had a very funny line about Jay.  We were talking about him at the Cellar this weekend about just how funny he is with impressions.  Like, he's just such a funny dude.  And Colin said he's a savant.  He said, in any savant, he goes, no, Jay's an asshole savant, which was very funny.  But he really is an asshole savant.  Colin.  I didn't know Colin got nominated.  Fuck, man.  That's great.  Fuck, yeah. 
[03:08:00]  Good for him.  Good for him.  He's having a wonderful year.  A wonderful year.  Yes.  Keep it up.  Godspeed.  Where's your picture?  She's still wrapping up Howard.  It'll happen, I think.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Behind schedule.  She's going to be like, I got to go.  Half this list that I got things to do has to be torn off.  How long has she been on Howard?  Over an hour, right?  She's obviously having a good time, which is good.  Oh, is it?  Is it?  What?  Is she singing?  Oh, fuck.  She did Edge of Glory on the piano, according to a Twitter feed.  It must have been nice.  Your photo is going to happen after the mashups, not in between. 
[03:08:30]  That's fine.  Oh, shit.  That's what I expected.  Now it's after.  I actually kind of always expected it.  Is this photo actually happening?  Well, the number two man.  Who's number one?  Ooh.  We don't name names.  Maybe I'm number one, because my phone just went off.  Oh, shit.  Are you trying to work magic over there?  What are you doing?  I could fucking get $100 right the fuck now.  Why?  Of course I'm typing reply. 
[03:09:00]  The $100 thing.  Yeah, I'm on it.  I'm not going to do it now.  Oh, shit.  It's after, I think.  Oh, Jimmy.  Are you all nervous?  Do you got butterflies?  Not really.  No, I just want to make sure.  You're panicking a little bit, right?  No, I'm not.  Slight panic.  A little panic.  A little panic.  Be honest.  A little panic.  A little panic.  No.  We can tell there's some anxiety going on.  A little bit.  When, will, how, who?  I've never seen that many people crammed into them.  To the mashup studio as there are right now.  Oh, really? 
[03:09:30]  Literally, there's people standing on stools up.  Like, it's full of people.  And who are those people?  Every Hits One intern is in there.  The web team is in there.  There's photographers, videographers.  Uh-oh, Kenny.  Bad news.  Fuck.  There's a lot of buzz in the hallway about that, Sam.  Because they got, like, the professional photo people, so, like, they can get publicity and  everything.  So, I think they're trying to figure out a way how to kick everybody else out of the  studio.  Oh, shit.  And they end up in the hallway. 
[03:10:00]  All right, but let's clarify something here.  Including the staff.  Don't walk in like there's bad news for anybody on this program.  Yeah, you really did.  They kind of set him off there.  You were like, uh-oh.  I do have to pick.  I'm ready.  Yeah, we'll go to break.  But I'm ready.  $100, Jimmy doesn't get his picture.  Oh, wow.  Who's the bet with?  I'm seeing if Van Juan's action.  Uh, no, because I think he'll do it.  I think this one, he's dedicated enough.  You think he will get the picture, then?  Nah, something's going to go horribly wrong.  Yeah, I think.  Because Obi said he won't get the picture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You say he will.  $100. 
[03:10:30]  I say he will.  All right, I'll go $100 with you.  I think Jimmy's going to get this.  He finally gets his Lady Gaga picture today?  He's dedicated today.  I got Laura Bush, dude, with the Secret Service agent next door.  Gaga, I couldn't do last time.  Don't make me bring up Bill Clinton again, because I will.  If I have to, I will.  I could have backdoored Gaga last time with Elo, but I made a conscious decision not to.  Because it would have hurt me here.  I'm taking my $100 off the table.  You bet, though.  You did get it.  And based on the buzz that's in the hallway, I would go with Anthony on this one. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, you really?  I think Jim's going to get it.  Why is there a buzz in the hallway, though?  Because she's a big Jim Norton fan.  People talking about planning, you are actually, you have, Kenny's not bluffing.  Part of the planning, sir, yeah.  I've heard your name mentioned, and this is what we'll do.  It's like, then we need a picture with Jim Norton.  But don't underestimate what I could do to prevent that picture.  No, don't do that.  Oh, for $100, you'd throw me at $100.  I'll pay you the $100.  Wow.  Turn it off.  I guess I think you might, man.  Turn it off.  All right, let's take a break. 
[03:11:30]  I got a tingle.  We'll see what happens with the Lady Gaga picture next.  Yes.  The virus to SiriusXM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  No, I just want to make sure I get it.  Good night.  So you wouldn't take Lady Gaga, period, clumps to the face to get a picture with her?  Well, for a picture, maybe.  But you guys have a cool...  We were discussing this whole thing.  Yeah.  When we went to break, I went to the bathroom with Jimmy, and I just crossed paths with Lady Gaga.  How was that?  I was in...  She looked good, man. 
[03:12:00]  You know what I am?  Close cocks with her in the bathroom.  And she ran into the ladies' room.  I ran into the men's room.  And I got to tell you, man, I'm out.  This fucking Lady Gaga is a hot piece of ass.  Dude, her ass is wearing like a little fucking thong.  I'm done making fun of Lady Gaga as far as not being attractive.  That ass was ridiculous.  Yeah.  She's sexy, man.  All right.  The face is a little rough, but the rest of it is still fucking just solid.  Yeah.  You like that shit?  Smells good.  I smelled it when she walked by.  She smells rich, like rich lady.  Yeah.  I wish she had some pit going on.  They gussy her all up. 
[03:12:30]  She's a mere, what, 20 feet away from us right now.  Yeah.  I'm going to go over there and work on the picture.  How tall is she?  Because she's running late.  She's small.  She's pretty short.  She's got heels on, though.  What?  Then she's really short, then.  She can't be more than five.  Why does she have bad wrestlers on?  No, not a heel.  Oh, Chip, Jim.  Oof.  I like wrestling jokes.  Of course you do.  And it's not even going to stick around.  I could give a shit.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Roland's waving.  Roland's waving.  And Jimmy's just right out the door. 
[03:13:00]  Right out the door.  Oh, boy.  Is the interview over?  I'll find out.  Oh, I like the hustle and bustle.  What's going on?  What's happening?  What's going on?  Everybody's listening to her interview on the mashups right outside the door.  On the mashup.  Yeah, they're all listening so you can hear it.  Yeah.  Is that her ass right there?  Yeah, look at that.  Let me see.  It was a fine-ass hit.  Here comes Sam.  Here comes Sam.  Sam?  Sam?  The interview is not over.  No.  Okay.  But they're in position because literally the minute it's over, she's at the door. 
[03:13:30]  They have to whisk her out because there's a lot of people waiting.  Oh, yeah.  That aren't going to get pictures or autographs.  That whole corner is full of people right now.  So how is Jimmy getting a picture?  Because there's a guy there who's in charge of this thing that knows that this is a priority  who is going to put Jimmy in, say, we're just going to get one picture.  But aren't, isn't everyone else going to be like, hey, hey, me, me.  He's going to, he's going to, he's going to say, no.  This is the way this shit is going.  This is going to cause some shit.  Remember, there's $100 on the table between you two. 
[03:14:00]  I want to see.  I might have taken my money off the table.  I want to see Jimmy come walking down the hallway with that face and just throw his fucking  camera against the window here and smash the camera and just, mother fuck that fucking  print and just go lose his mind.  We love the kid, but I got to tell you.  Oh, believe me.  It's the only way I want this to work out.  I'm rooting for him to get the picture because I love Jimmy, but to see the pandemonium.  Yes, that would be Jimmy not getting the picture.  See him come back empty-handed. 
[03:14:30]  There's part of it.  Because, you know, he'd just be, that fucking asshole, that motherfucker.  He'd be so mad.  Why can't I get a picture with Lady Gaga?  Go ahead.  Call up.  Go out there.  I ain't going out there.  Go out.  Take a look.  I'm not going out there.  See who's out there.  I just see, what I'm seeing is a fuckload of people walking that way.  Like, everyone in the building is walking over that way to see the Gaga. 
[03:15:00]  Anthony, you ever been to Salt Lake City, Utah?  Oh, you're going to plug?  Yeah.  I'm just talking.  Yeah, I've been to Salt Lake City.  I've been there, sure.  You ever been to Wise Guys Comedy Club?  I can't say I have, but I would go there if something good was happening.  Is there?  Jimmy's going to be there August 19 and 20.  Well, that's a reason to go.  I'll say.  Yes.  Tickets on sale now.  Like right now?  Yeah, wiseguyscomedy.com.  So I go to that website and I can get tickets?  Yeah, Wise Guys Comedy Club is in the Grizzly Plaza. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, I know where that is.  Do you?  No.  It's West Valley City.  It's in a suburb of Salt Lake.  Oh, well, that sounds good.  Jimmy's begging me to stay away.  What do I do?  Why?  I'm going back in.  Why is he begging you to stay away?  He thinks you're going to sabotage this?  Yeah, he's really nervous.  I'm going to fuck it up.  Like you're going to run up.  Just call her.  Call her like Stephanie.  And then she'll just run out of here.  I've never seen this many people.  They're all over the place. 
[03:16:00]  Like people are jockeying for position to catch even a look at her.  Yeah.  How do people get to be such giant celebrities?  She's dressed kind of like Nazi garb.  Really?  Yeah, with like the black, like tight, like suit with that black hat.  She got her jack boots on?  I don't know.  I do.  It's like a lot of entourage.  Nice thigh high jack boots.  You know this deal?  Jimmy is showing Roland how to use the camera over and over and over again.  One button and then pop the flash. 
[03:16:30]  They're practicing.  Oh, boy.  Roland has to practice.  You know how he does this.  He is right now freaking out.  The closer it gets to the time where he's supposed to get this picture, the more Jimmy  is freaking out.  Well, Roland was happy that I was the designated cameraman.  Yeah, yeah, but now it's him.  And I'm going to tell you this, and somebody should have informed Roland.  Yes, Sam.  I mean, Roland's not good at taking pictures.  Oh, no.  Even Travis just walked in and said, no, he's not good.  He'll get you in the corner. 
[03:17:00]  He'll zoom in too much.  He's bad at taking pictures.  He doesn't know the rule of thirds or anything.  He's just very bad.  He's bad at taking pictures.  He'll take pictures from the wrong angle.  Oh, yeah.  Too much headroom, too much footroom.  Especially on a day like this when he's nervous because he knows it's important.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah.  He can easily fuck his son.  This is one shot.  Eric should be taking the picture.  Eric's forcing the matchup to sit through her latest single.  Oh, God.  What happened?  You should get audio.  Wait, wait.  So they're just playing it like a record, and she's sitting there?  Yeah, she's standing there. 
[03:17:30]  What a waste of time.  She's standing there dancing, and everyone else is just like, uh.  Did you see her dancing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she's right there, man.  Can I take a peek?  Yeah, get it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'll hold down the fort.  I'll take it.  I just want to sit.  Hey, so, Travis, what's going on?  What's up, Kenny?  It's just me and you just talking.  How was your weekend?  That was great.  It was beautiful weather.  It really was.  Yeah.  I went to the beach.  Nice.  Yeah.  I hope you sunblock. 
[03:18:00]  I didn't, actually.  My back is killing me.  Oh, see?  This is good stuff.  If hindsight was 20-20.  I know.  Monday morning quarterback, right?  I hear ya.  What about you, Mars?  Mars is going to a concert Thursday.  Yes, I am.  He's going to see Rihanna.  That is correct.  Yeah.  Oh, here comes the hosts.  Big fucking shit.  Who gives a fuck?  What do you think, Ant?  She's standing there with her dumb glasses on, her pseudo-Nazi, but not ballsy enough to 
[03:18:30]  put a swastika on it hat.  You should have seen this place when she was doing the interview in the fishbowl.  Yeah.  There were people upstairs just lining the stairs.  Work stopped here.  Like the Brady Bunch?  Yeah.  Work stopped.  Oh.  For the hour that she was here.  And work didn't stop here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  Ah, she's just standing there.  She's wearing these big, giant, platformy boots.  And then I didn't see anything in the middle.  I saw her head and her boots.  And then I wasn't able to see, like, the best part, which is supposedly her ass. 
[03:19:00]  But who gives a shit?  She's standing in there while everyone's fawning over her playing her song on the fucking,  playing a disc.  What the fuck?  What do you think, Mars?  What's the attraction?  I mean, I understand.  Look, she's hot and everything.  But there's a crowd, there is a crowd of fucking people over there that are all just gazing  and looking.  What's that going to do?  What is that?  They could say they saw Lady Gaga this time.  Yeah.  So could I.  Yeah.  I peeked in.  I went, ah, that's her.  There she is. 
[03:19:30]  I'm here with you.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  I hear you, Kenny.  Yeah.  I ain't fucking fault for those shenanigans.  Is Rowan still taking the picture?  One thing I didn't see, I didn't see was Jimmy.  Where was he?  He may have been in place already.  Where's in place for Jimmy for this big photo moment?  Jimmy's in the forefront.  I've seen so many people over there that if he gets his picture, I'm going to be amazed.  Do you see the amount of people out of there?  Yeah.  They're going to want to pull her the fuck out of there.  I don't think it's a guarantee.  I don't either. 
[03:20:00]  I don't care who said what.  That's no guarantee.  He's in the proper position.  What's the position, by the way?  Right outside the door with the right people that could make it happen.  It's not a guarantee.  They could push them away.  Like, her security is just like, come on.  And you know how it is.  No, but someone said, yeah, right.  What if she says no?  Gone.  And then she doesn't even answer.  She just has to put her hands up and keep walking and secure it and be like, nope, nope, nope.  Do you know there's a whole company email trail about Jimmy getting his picture? 
[03:20:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Hooray.  Had a right hurrah.  Who called Mrs. Mantia.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, there's a whole email trail.  Oh, now Steve's in on this whole thing?  Yes.  Yeah.  I see Steve Blatter walking, making his way over to the Lady Gaga glass fishbowl.  Yeah.  Because everybody's got to get a look.  Place to see and be seen.  But Jimmy's in position, I don't know, this ain't a sure thing. 
[03:21:00]  How much longer have they got?  Like a minute?  Can't be that much longer.  It can't be.  It's got to be like two more minutes.  It's 15 minutes.  Yeah.  And we have people stationed there.  Sam is over there.  Sam's over there.  Opie's over there.  Sam's got a recorder.  Yeah?  Oh, okay, good.  He can get the initial pissed-off-edness when, uh, I just want to hear this on his recorder.  No, no pictures.  No, no, but, but I, and I'm going to hear a little Jimmy going, like, no, I was told  that, get, step back, you fuck, you fuck, just all mad. 
[03:21:30]  Another Derek Cheater.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fuck her, you cunt.  Fuck you.  That, he, oh, he'll go off.  He would go off.  Uh, yeah, there's people, more people going down that way than they're coming back.  Yeah.  Still a giant scene.  Is it just going to be an entourage, like a whole fucking gaggle of people walking down  the hallway, you think, to the, and is she taking the main elevator down? 
[03:22:00]  Uh.  What do you think?  Oh, I know.  You know?  Yeah.  Is it the main elevator?  Is she going to go out the back?  There's a lot of paparazzi outside?  She's traveling away.  Somebody else travels in this building.  Ah, okay, so she ain't fucking going to be seen.  You're just going to see a black car come out of a fucking garage.  That's what you're going to see.  There's a lot of people waiting outside.  She's pulling a Casey Anthony getaway out of this motherfucker.  A lot of little monsters downstairs. 
[03:22:30]  Are there a lot of little monsters?  They're going to be saying, what, where?  Well, you know what?  I'm going to fucking laugh at them when I go downstairs.  You think she wants to fucking hang out with the likes of you idiots?  It's tough to begin with because there's two exits to the lobby, so.  Yeah.  You're really, you're hedging your bets.  Yeah, yeah, one way or another.  Like when Danny didn't meet Dave Mustaine.  Because he was at the wrong exit.  He didn't know.  Okay, here comes Opie.  Opie's coming back.  But, yeah, I'm going to goof on the little monsters waiting outside because they ain't  going to see her.  They're going to see a black car.  And they're not going to leave until they hear her. 
[03:23:00]  They're going to see a black car pull out of a garage.  This fucking broad could babble.  Oh, is she fucking just. . .  And what is she talking about?  I don't know.  Like, it's got to be just an inane Lady Gaga speak.  You know. . .  Going into position.  We. . .  All right, going into position.  Opie's got his camera out, though.  I think he's going to. . .  Is he going to try?  Or is he going to put one of those where he holds the camera at arm's length as she's  walking and snaps a picture?  He's only got his camera phone.  He should have his good camera.  They wouldn't allow that. 
[03:23:30]  They'd smack it right out of his hands.  Video?  Are you crazy?  In this building?  Why, I ought to. . .  You know how people are.  They get crazy.  But I can't wait because we're going to have to walk downstairs through those people.  Should I tell them Gaga's coming down in the elevator?  Sar?  She'll be right down.  She'll be right down.  Make sure your cameras are ready, guys.  Yeah.  And then I'll hop in the Escalade and be like, I'm picking her up.  I'm our driver.  Right.  You think they'll fall for that?  Step back.  Step back.  I want everybody to stand in line. 
[03:24:00]  She's only going to sign one autograph per person.  And then I just peel out and leave rocks in their face.  And asbestos brake dust from the city streets.  They, uh...  Everybody's very excited.  I really could give a shit.  I'm surprised they're allowing so many people to stand in the hallway.  Do they have a choice?  Do they have a curtain?  Sure.  Well, no.  I mean, the company.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They do have a curtain.  Because the big security boss is out there and everything. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, okay.  You mean good morning?  No, no.  Not that.  Good morning.  I thought he was there.  Good morning, everybody.  Monday morning.  I don't think he's anywhere near the top.  Good morning.  Oh, you don't think he's up at the upper echelon of security?  Have you spoken to him?  No.  I've only said good morning to him.  Good morning.  Monday morning.  Get the time, date, and weather from that guy.  Yes.  He's like an app.  No, an app.  Stop it.  Troy's telling me he shaves at the front desk in the morning. 
[03:25:00]  Does he?  I've never seen that.  I can't confirm that, but I wouldn't be surprised.  Any minute now, we're going to get a report of Jimmy in his big effort to get a Lady Gaga photo.  This has failed twice before for Jimmy.  Third time's a charm.  From things supposedly all set up for him.  Everything's in place.  A lot of confusion.  A lot of people.  So this is going to take like a mission organization for this to be pulled off. 
[03:25:30]  Like the accuracy of a military mission.  SEAL Team 6 is out there.  Yes.  SEAL Team 6.  And look, like Sam has already brought up, just because he gets the picture, there's no guarantee it's going to be a good picture.  No, and especially with Roland taking it.  Roland is panicky Pete, too.  Yeah, there's no guarantee.  And they ran drills on how to open up the camera, get the flash on.  If that flash doesn't come off.  OP update.  OP is coming in now.  OP update.  OP update on the situation.  What do we got?  I'm very sad to report. 
[03:26:00]  Oh.  Jim's chopper went down over the Sea of Japan.  It spun in.  There was no picture.  Was it the Sea of Japan?  I don't even know.  Yeah.  Hey, he got his picture?  Yeah, he got his picture.  How did it work?  How did it go down?  She finished the interview.  She finished babbling.  Yeah.  And then she, it's pretty unbelievable, actually.  Yeah.  Then interview ends, and there were three pictures.  One with the morning mashup.  Uh-huh.  One with just Lady Gaga. 
[03:26:30]  Uh-huh.  And one with Jim Norton.  Wow.  And everyone else, shut the fuck out.  Just don't even ask.  There he is.  Let me see.  Let me see it.  There's no picture on my camera.  No, come on.  Let me see it.  There's no picture on my camera.  Why?  Because it had to be with the official camera.  But I'll tell you what.  Here's what happened.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  So you don't have a picture?  Not at the moment.  Oh, no.  So there is a possibility there's no picture still.  It was taken with, there was a Getty photographer. 
[03:27:00]  And there was our-  Oh, this gasoline had to do with it.  And there was our in-house photographer, that woman who comes in here.  She's really good, and she has an amazing camera.  She has a better camera than me.  Oh, she does.  She took so many fucking pictures of us.  And, by the way, never seen one.  Yeah, we don't get to see those pictures.  Never seen one.  That Paris Hilton picture she took with the mic is great.  Oh, really?  And she had a flash.  I haven't seen that one.  So Roland, they said no other photographer is just her or just Getty.  But Roland got in.  But the way it was is, like, she took a picture with the mashup. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  And then one solo.  And then Ross, Ross Zepin really helped me because he goes, oh, one more, one more.  Like, Ross made that happen.  Oh, man.  They were going to go.  Oh, yeah.  They were getting ready to roll.  Literally, it's like Obama is standing in the room because everybody, she knows if she  stops, everybody's going to take photos.  It's going on in this world.  She's just a celebrity.  She gives a shit.  Who gives the fuck she takes 20 pictures?  I'm just saying.  Where's she going?  Why is everybody angry?  I'm happy.  Where's she going?  Let me explain what happened.  But who cares? 
[03:28:00]  Take 20 fucking pictures.  Take a picture of everyone in that hallway.  It's 20 people.  What type of fucking fan?  But nobody else.  Nobody was asking.  Take pictures all fucking day.  No one was asking because they've all been fucking beaten down and reprimanded.  But I wasn't.  So I stood up against the thing.  She had a little leather outfit on.  She was nice.  Did you put your arm around her?  Yeah.  Did you hold her ass?  She wasn't nice.  She didn't even know she was standing next to you.  But she was friendly.  Did she say hi?  She made her claw in your picture.  She went, hi.  I'm a big fan.  She's like, thank you.  What is she going to say?  How about talk like a human?  That's all she should have said. 
[03:28:30]  That's all I say.  Someone says I'm a big fan.  Can I take a picture?  Sure.  And that's the end of the interview.  You're putting these celebrities up on much too high a pedestal, Jim.  No, I'm not.  No, you are.  I'm realistic about what I expect out of them, which is very little.  She doesn't know me.  Fuck her.  She should take pictures with everybody that was in that hallway.  She should take pictures with everybody that's supporting her.  Everyone in that hallway.  Because you know what?  Regardless, wherever she's going right this fucking second, she could be five minutes later.  But I don't know that she wasn't taking pictures.  They're all people in the business.  Everyone in the hallway were people who were... 
[03:29:00]  Her entourage...  They've all been beaten down and told not to bug her for pictures.  There were no fans in the hallway.  Believe me.  It doesn't matter.  Everybody wanted a picture.  Everyone's standing there.  They're all fans.  I wanted a picture.  If you're standing there, you're only standing there to look at them, not the mashup.  Well, Roland is going to get...  I wanted a picture, Ant.  But I was scared to ask.  ...from the lady.  But I want to see how big...  I want the big files.  Because sometimes the Tonight Show will take photos and they send you a smaller copy.  Oh, you want the actual size.  And I want the two megabyte file.  You want to be able to blow it up for a billboard.  But she got like two or three pictures off with the flash, dead center, just me and her. 
[03:29:30]  Roland's walking.  Did you see?  Why is Roland walking away?  I want to hear Roland.  Did I see who?  Roland!  No, I didn't.  You can't hear it through the glass?  No, but I know that she's good.  And she'll send you the file.  But tell Roland I want the big files, Mars.  I'm with Ant, man.  How tough is your day that you can't take a few pictures?  That you can't fucking...  Are you kidding me?  But who knows?  She might have.  It's not necessarily her.  And if you became extremely famous, would you be like, oh, fuck, I got to take 20 pictures  everywhere I go?  That's the whole military attitude going on with these fucking celebrities. 
[03:30:00]  The pictures have to go through the approval process now.  See?  Now they got to go through the approval process from...  Blow me!  Yeah, they took her card.  So they're going through all the pictures.  If they prove it, they'll send it to you.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm sure they will.  Are you kidding right now?  No, it's a big to do right now because they pulled a serious card.  They said, until you prove it, we'll get back to you.  You are never getting that picture.  Thank you.  That's not true.  I'm sorry.  That's not true.  I will get to you.  Jimmy, and I am sorry.  Thank you.  That proves what I'm saying.  This is how this fucking bullshit works. 
[03:30:30]  Fuck him!  Roland nailed you so well.  Oh, did he fucking nail Jimmy?  God damn it.  Jimmy, you were fucking nervous.  I was like, motherfucker.  They took the whole card.  He got me.  He saw the card nailed you. 
[03:31:00]  You're like Bobo.  But I'm not.  He's good.  You're in fun with Bobo, but he gets you every time.  That's not fair.  He was good.  He was good.  He got Anthony too.  Because I'm like, really?  And the way he went, no.  He goes, no, really.  Anthony just broke his laptop closing it.  I was very angry.  Because he goes, those motherfuckers.  Motherfuckers.  And you know what?  That would make sense.  That's not that crazy.  It would.  All right.  You got me too.  Roland, that was a good one, man.  You nailed us all.  She has the pictures up there?  Yeah.  She's right in the restroom because everybody has to wait.  They're holding the elevator for her to run right in. 
[03:31:30]  But where's the photographer?  Wait, where's she right now?  She's sending out the pictures.  Oh, so I'll get him before I leave today?  That's fucking right.  You'll get within an hour.  Is she in the restroom right now?  What the fuck?  Is she taking a duty?  The camera person.  Yeah.  Oh, no, no.  The camera person is like, she's cleaning up the photos.  She's making a big lady gaga duty.  Did you tell her I want the big files?  The original, whoever came in, the original file to send to you.  She might send smaller through email.  Well, I said to you who wants the original file, though.  Can you tell her that I want the big file?  Make sure you know big because.  Put it on a clit drive.  You need the big. 
[03:32:00]  She fucking looked good.  Those pictures are good, right?  Yeah, but she had her dress that she wore for a concert, the army dress.  I like that leather thing she was just wearing.  It's very Nazi.  You can see her butt, too.  Yeah, she looked good.  I had my little arm around her waist.  Of course, she didn't recognize me.  Was her waist very thin and slender?  Wait, you wanted her to recognize you?  No, I didn't expect her to.  You always want somebody to recognize you.  I think she didn't have time to even look.  No.  The other day, she shut people aside.  That's the kind of fucking people these celebrities are. 
[03:32:30]  The thing is, and I have to defend it.  I'm not putting her on a pedestal, but when you're on that level of fucking fame, you have  12 million Twitter followers.  It's like a level of fame that you can't go anywhere in the world without everybody in  the room wanting to talk to you.  That must be a drag.  I'm not talking about everybody in the world.  I'm not saying it's bad.  I'm just saying it's nice, though.  But not everyone in the world.  She seemed friendly, dude.  I've met plenty of people that were assholes, and she didn't seem like an asshole.  Here's the problem I have, and this spells it all out.  It shouldn't have been such an issue for you to get a picture.  But that's not her. 
[03:33:00]  It should just be.  That's the people around her.  Like, let's just say, play the devil's advocate.  She's got a schedule.  She does Howard for an hour.  She does this.  Let's just say she has to be on TV in 20 minutes.  Let's say she has to be somewhere in a half hour, and 40 people want to take photos,  and she's going to be late for a live interview.  How about the fact that this itself is a secure environment?  These aren't just people from the streets.  You need a badge and shit to get into this fucking place at all.  But I'm not saying she shouldn't take pictures of people here. 
[03:33:30]  I'm only saying I get why there has to be some kind of a process or an order to it.  It's too much.  Maybe it is.  It's too much, and it's nothing more than trying to perpetuate this level of mystique  and celebrity for her than it is for convenience or inconvenience of scheduling.  But they are right to a certain degree, because do you see the way people were just standing  in the hall?  Yeah.  If they weren't justified in doing that, they wouldn't be all those people in the hall  waiting to see her.  They are right about her level of fame and the level of interest people have in talking 
[03:34:00]  to her.  You know what I think about this whole thing?  What?  I'll tell you in the elevator.  All right.  Me too.  I do think.  We'll see you, I guess, tomorrow.  So, Roland, maybe we can get this picture before I go.  Yeah, best time we go work right now.  I love you.  And I want the big files and a kiss.  And thank you to Ross for making that happen.  I do appreciate it.  I hope they come out okay.  Roland nailed you.  Yes, Roland did nail me.  And I went through the process this time of, I got a hold of Elo and I heard back from 
[03:34:30]  him, but then I never heard from him again.  So I was kind of bummed.  But I guess he just, I don't know, maybe he's busy.  And then I emailed Scott, the president, and he emailed me back and he emailed Ross and  to try to help Jim.  But that was all Ross Zapin.  Ross made that happen.  I don't know why I'm talking about this.  Like I'm accepting an award for something.  I really did nothing.  Except I'm a fucking 13-year-old girl.  And a part of me was secretly hoping that she would recognize me.  You never know.  Abdul-Jabbar did.  That was a fucking thrill. 
[03:35:00]  He didn't know my name or the show I was on.  But he goes, let's show.  She didn't.  She's fucking sexy though, man.  I was very attracted to her.  I'm not going to lie.  Fucking little leather, fucking like plastique fucking thing.  I would love to run my hands over her backside and give him a pat.  Like when you get a bass hit in Little League.  A little pat on the fanny.  That's how I'd like to pat Lady Gaga's fanny.  And I'm glad I didn't call her Stephanie because I was going to.  I'm such a fucking idiot.  I would have thought that was like familiar.  Like, hey, Steph.  And she would go, oh, this guy is kind of intriguing.  He understands my name. 
[03:35:30]  But I heard she doesn't like that.  So you have to call her Gaga.  But I'm happy that I got the photo.  I'll be very happy once I actually have it.  Fucking Roland got me good.  Even though he had my camera.  I mean, we couldn't do it with my camera.  Because they said only Getty and the house photographer.  But I'm in a way glad it happened that way now.  Because now there wasn't 50.  We were both looking at the.  And then the Getty photographer was going to take a picture.  And then she just left.  And it's like, you know, why would she stand there with me?  I'm a fucking fat tits in a government mule shirt. 
[03:36:00]  Fucking zilch.  I'm a fanboy.  I wish I wasn't like this.  I really do wish I wasn't like this.  It kind of makes me not like myself.  Because I've turned into such a fanboy.  All these years of doing shows.  And being a stand-up.  And meeting famous people.  Just by being in the right place at the right time.  And I'm still affected by it.  And it annoys me that I'm affected by it.  Why?  Why have I not just gotten used to it?  Why am I not in show business? 
[03:36:30]  Why do I give a fuck?  Why do I try to stalk Diane Keaton for a photo when I do Leno with her?  She's 65.  I haven't cared about a project she's done since The Godfather 2.  After 1974.  Everything Diane Keaton did is irrelevant to me.  Except Annie Hall.  And the fact that she was fucking Woody Allen.  I do like that.  And I will be performing in Utah for the first time.  Salt Lake City.  August 19th and 20th.  And I will be showing my Lady Gaga photo. 
[03:37:00]  I'm going to have a shirt made up.  Like the fucking fanboy girl.  Unrecognizable.  F-list.  F-list.  Maybe that's why I'm not an A-lister.  Because I don't talk good.  I have fucking Edmund Muskie strokes.  While I'm trying to go on a rant by myself.  If I ever think I can do my own radio show.  Remind me of this four minutes.  I'm actually looking at the clock.  Have I been on for four hours yet?  I really am a fucking third wheel D-lister.  Alright, well I guess that's it for me.  I'm just kind of stalling. 
[03:37:30]  Until Roland can bring me a fucking file.  He got me good though.  Fuck.  He really got...  I don't know how Pharrell talks for four hours by himself.  I guess half it's that.  But I don't know how he does it.  Hi buddy.  I emailed her and cc'd you.  Thank you.  I'm not sure where her office is.  We'll find it.  You're a fan of Emmett Smith?  Who?  Emmett Smith.  Yes.  He wants to come in September.  Absolutely, Emmett Smith.  I love him.  He's a Hall of Fame cowboy. 
[03:38:00]  Fucking love Emmett Smith.  Yes.  What's he promoting?  A book?  See, we always get them on books.  If Gaga writes a book, we got her.  She'll come in.  I would love to hear her talk about taking pictures of a pussy.  I think she has a book coming out this Christmas.  Let's hope we...  Oh, what a gift!  What a gift!  She looked hot, though.  Fuck, she's sexy, man.  Yeah, she smelled good, too.  Yeah, she did!  She's a tough one, though, man.  That's a fucking...  That's an uber tough one.  That's a hard one to get.  I think it's between her and Obama. 
[03:38:30]  Obama, there wouldn't be anything in the hallway.  Yeah.  Every door would be sealed.  Like, you can't even pop in.  I know the process Obama goes through on The Tonight Show when he does it.  And the stage manager, Lynn, was telling me, like, she has pictures with Bush and Obama, because  she's one of the only people out on the set when Obama's there, because she's the stage  manifer.  Wow.  So she has to tell you when to go out.  You said manifer.  Yeah, I know.  I also said fucking...  What else did I trip on?  I tripped on something a second ago.  Got all this nervous energy. 
[03:39:00]  Did something.  Well, I don't have the photo yet.  Right.  She looked good, man.  She looked really good.  Fuck.  I saw some of the pictures that she took.  She has, like, the high-quality camera.  Did you see the ones with me and Gaga?  No, I just saw the one by herself, though.  But she had a high-quality camera, like 50 megapixels.  How did you already see that one, but you haven't seen Jim?  Yeah, because she turned this way and showed the single-seller Gaga.  I hope she didn't accidentally delete mine.  She might have.  I don't think so.  And I hope she doesn't give me a fucking, like, a 50-megabyte copy that kind of looks  great on Facebook, and when you blow it up, it's a pixelated piece of shite. 
[03:39:30]  You know what sucks?  When the cards get corrupted before you get to pull the pictures off.  There's a way to get them off, though.  Even if it's a corrupted card, I would just, I would fucking just pay.  Yeah, but plus, I mean...  That was a tough one to get, man.  God, she's fucking sexy.  She was.  Her ass was good, too.  Dude, her ass looked fucking fantastic.  Lucky toilet.  Yeah, it was really nice.  Really nice.  She's still out there.  She's in the bathroom.  She's not in the bathroom.  No, no, I'm not joking.  When the guys walked by, she was still out there.  Oh.  She must be dropping a long one.  I bet he's a fucking two-footer.  What a trooper.  I'm guessing she drank Duck and Nose coffee, because that's a major shit. 
[03:40:00]  Either that or she's on a rag.  I mean, she's trying to fucking get in there with the fucking leather, and she's got to  pull down the...  You predicted it.  Yeah.  The period thing.  Her boyfriend's lucky, man.  She smells so good, though.  Yeah, she's a fucking...  She's a superstar.  I'd rather interview her, though.  I mean, I'm bummed I can't interview her.  It's like, we would love to...  Paris sucked, but I know she...  I heard she was very good on Howard.  She was really good.  She had two songs, too.  Did you listen to today's show at all?  What?  Howard.  Opie and Anthony?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:40:30]  I mean, you know a lot about what went on Howard's show today.  That's true.  So I wonder when these pictures will be arriving.  Yeah, that...  Does she know that there's an urgency to them?  Um...  And there's a man...  There's a moderate career who's panicking.  The serial thing was really good, Sam.  Oh, boy.  You missed a lot, huh?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Well, we'll see.  I'm looking at my email now.  What, do you want to take a break?  For what?  We got breaks to take.  You got breaks to take.  I'm going home.  This isn't in my picture. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, I know, but you can...  I see her, then you can reply.  Say, hey, this is...  Hey, this is Jim.  Where is it?  That's in capital letters.  I'm still waiting.  Why would I have fucking faster 3G service?  Fucking cunt.  Why is it in the Wi-Fi?  Isn't stupid?  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  There's always problems with the Wi-Fi.  Does she have his Gmail address,  or is she going to send it to a SiriusXM?  The Gmail, because you can send Bigfooters to Gmail.  Maybe she can send it to fucking my Yellow Treats address.  Can you stop sending me AOL email? 
[03:41:30]  That fucking spam haven.  AOL stinks.  So does MySpace.  I was going to say that to Justin Timberlake.  What about him?  That's why he's at Comic-Con Pro to you, too.  Oh, isn't he terrific?  That's good for him.  He's another one we didn't get to talk to.  Well, no, it'll be at Comic-Con this year, though.  Will we get him?  Sam might on Friday.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but it's like...  Are you going to be doing stuff?  He has, like, literally two minutes, two, three minutes.  I might get him with the...  I'm shooting Fileno Thursday, Friday. 
[03:42:00]  So you'll probably get for Friday.  Maybe, and I'm doing stuff with Sam.  So we're staying in different hotels.  Which hotel are you at?  The one that they put me up in, which is a little farther away, but, you know, it's on the water.  Yeah.  You enjoy yourself.  Yeah, I'm knocking myself out.  But you have to get a car, too.  I got a second rental car.  Kevin Smith is just sending you by the water.  What's that?  Kevin Smith.  I might be in that one.  What we could do is maybe...  I was thinking maybe you could...  I have to see what time we're shooting every day.  What time does Comic-Con go?  It doesn't go into the night. 
[03:42:30]  It stops, like, seven, right?  Yeah, it stops around dinner time.  And then they do movies and stuff, but that's not that convention stuff.  What I'm saying is maybe you can meet at the...  Even our hotel is five miles farther away.  Yeah.  Maybe you can come and meet me at our hotel and just come over with the whole crew.  We could all go together, so you don't have to drive and park separately,  because I imagine we'll have better parking.  Yeah, I mean...  Since we don't have to go by yourself.  I would love to, yeah.  And then Saturday, we can fend for ourselves.  You know, kind of doing double duty out there. 
[03:43:00]  You're a hard worker.  It's like a lot of people say,  Jim Norton is going on vacation again,  but they don't realize it's work.  It is work.  It never stops.  No.  I'm going to rely on radio my whole life.  I love radio, but it's like, come on, you've got to fucking balance.  Yeah.  I never go on vacation.  I never take vacation.  I love going away and doing gigs,  and it was fun being in L.A.  But I'm fucking...  It's work.  I don't know who's on...  And it's Monday the 25th, not this Monday.  I know.  It's not...  There's no listings out yet.  The Tonight Show always holds back. 
[03:43:30]  This Monday is today.  No, no, but I'm saying it's next Monday.  Right.  It's not tonight.  Well, they may have it on this...  They don't.  On the media website?  No, I'm...  Hold on.  Thank you, Kenny.  I'm on 48.  I'm taking cab.  Actually, I put cab-o.  I'm so nervous, I put cab-o.  So, Norton's still waiting for his picture.  Yeah.  That the SiriusXM photographer took,  because Lady Gaga wouldn't allow...  Or whatever, Lady Gaga's people...  The rule was only...  Getty and...  And the one SiriusXM photographer, so... 
[03:44:00]  But she's good, and she has a great camera,  so it's not like some fucking, you know...  Yeah, she's like a photographer.  She's not just like some publicist who had a cheap camera.  And she got a couple of pictures off.  She had a couple of photos off, which is great.  Will you be really upset if you blink in both of them?  Nah, I mean, I will, but I always...  To me, the picture is the cool thing.  Like, I'm not going to do look good in it.  How do you feel about the surroundings in the picture?  Do you care, like...  Yes, I like it to be clear.  But the fact that it says SiriusXM behind me, 
[03:44:30]  I'm fine with that.  You like that?  Yeah, it's a clean picture.  It's just me and her.  Because the option...  It's probably better to do it with the backdrop  than it would be to do it in front of these glass studios,  because the flash glares back,  and you could end up with a blurry picture.  I'm fine with the backdrop like that.  Because that's a legit backdrop.  It's not a bunch of people.  Roland, I'm right here.  I mean, it's not an odd moment.  What are you doing, Roland?  He's opening my email.  Oh.  Just sign out.  Yeah, sign out.  Sam doesn't have anything duplicitous in there. 
[03:45:00]  I'm a very open person.  Everybody has Gmail.  How do you not know how to sign out of Gmail?  Exactly.  There's this thing that says sign out.  Sorry, I shouldn't have...  Roland did help me in here when I'm attacking him.  Well, because you have all this nasty, nervous energy,  and you're ready to attack whoever.  Roland was really nervous.  Roland?  Taking the picture,  because I said this on the air to Opie and Anthony  while you were out.  Roland's not a good photographer.  I'm okay.  But not great.  Not great.  No. 
[03:45:30]  Why is it showing that there's an attack?  Did you get the email?  No, but only from Roland.  Yeah, I just emailed her and CC'd you.  Yeah.  So when she replies, you get it right away, too.  Why is there an attachment?  Does that mean there's a CC?  Oh, no, no.  That's because the signature, they always do that for Gmail.  Oh.  Hoping to be big pictures.  You're saying, what was there?  It must be the picture then, right?  Here's what we'll do.  We'll take a break.  We'll find her and just ask her,  can I have them on a disc?  Maybe a big copy on a disc.  That way you don't have to worry about emailing them.  There's like two or three of them on a... 
[03:46:00]  I think she snapped like two or three.  I think three, yeah.  Well, 52!  I want 52!  So, uh...  I don't know if she got 52.  But I know I'm going to look like a fat...  Here's what's going to happen.  Gaga's going to look pretty good.  I'm going to look like a fat, mopey pig with my head leaning in.  That's my favorite part.  Glad you got her next to you.  That's true.  That's my favorite part about taking pictures with you because you take the...  You get all excited.  It's my belly button.  You take the picture.  You're happy you got the picture.  And you look at the picture and for one second you're happy because it's you next to this 
[03:46:30]  celebrity.  Yes.  And then right after that second is over, you just sit there in a state of self-loathing  looking at how fat you are.  Yeah.  Most of my...  The celebrity pictures bring out a weird self-loathing.  I don't know...  Because I don't know why.  Why do I still look at famous people like I did when I was 10?  Because it's also like you're in the business.  Right.  But like you said, your fanboy status, like you're immediately...  When you're going to these lengths to get a picture with somebody like Lady Gaga, you  are lowering yourself far beneath her. 
[03:47:00]  Like you're saying, look how far above me you are.  So you're looking at this picture.  Sam just called you an ass.  And you got...  But that's what it is.  That's why Sam's right.  He's 100% right.  So you're looking at this picture and not only do you see what's there, but you know  what was going on in your mind.  And you can see it on your face.  You don't have a confident facial expression because you're nervous and you're like, look,  I'm in this picture, a lower being than not even got LeVar Burton or whoever it is.  It's like if I perform...  I was very nervous doing Leno because I didn't have faith in the piece I shot at the ESPYs. 
[03:47:30]  I saw the rough cut of it and I just...  I thought I stunk.  I thought I was terrible in it.  It just...  I was not...  I'm like, there's nothing they could take out of this that's going to get laughs.  And it did okay in the rehearsal.  Two-trick stage collapsed.  Two-trick stage.  That's funny.  Stupid song.  I want...  The eternal flame song.  But I didn't have faith in the piece because I didn't like myself in it.  And then we made a couple of small fucking cuts. 
[03:48:00]  And anyway, Rickles was there.  So I was terrified that Rickles was going to see me bomb in this piece.  So before the show, I went and I talked to him and he was very nice.  But after he saw the piece and it killed in front of the audience and it was so nice  to walk off and he's like, oh, Jim, that was great.  Like a comedian to comedian thing.  And it's like, you're an entertainer as well as I am.  What a fucking feel.  And then after we did promo, because they asked me to do promo with them, right?  You just stand there and Jay throws to these fucking news shows. 
[03:48:30]  And I'm talking to Rickles and he's got his arm around me.  And we're talking about his set on the couch.  Because you're getting to a point where now there's mutual admiration.  And that's where you want to be.  Because not only do you get to interact with this celebrity who you idolize, but you don't  have to disrespect.  You're actually getting some semblance of respect.  Or just mutual, even if it's not admiration, even if it's just, I understand that we're  both performing in this arena together.  Yeah.  And Don Rickles can say, I accept that you are a performer, not like, oh, you're just some 
[03:49:00]  kid who's trying.  And he saw that it was funny and it was something I was legitimately proud of.  But it was like, it's nice to have a guy who I admire that much say, hey, that was funny  what you did.  And I know that they're not blowing smoke up my ass because I thought it was good.  You know what I mean?  It's like, that's where you feel okay.  We could talk to Sam or we could go get Marlo pictures.  I say we get Marlo.  That's right.  And then Troy and I have a thing to do.  Ooh, what kind of a thing?  We go into a studio and we massage each other.  Oh, that's like, did you hear when Danny and Travis were admitting to doing that to each 
[03:49:30]  other in the office?  A couple of mo's.  Like, they actually do it.  Like, not like you were just saying it was a joke.  Not ironically, yeah.  Like, they're fruit.  It's just the two of them in the office and Troy or somebody will see through the glass  that by themselves they're massaging each other.  I'm going to bring my camera just in case Gaga's walking around.  She might see the O&A pictures and want another one.  Maybe.  She might want another one?  Why not?  Why wouldn't she?  No, you're right.  She might be like, oh, that was Jim Norton from Opian Answer.  I'd love to get one for myself.  She's going to look.  But her people knew who you were. 
[03:50:00]  That woman that was with her.  Yeah.  A lot of her people did, but it's always that way.  If there's a big enough entourage, one of them will always recognize me.  It's just odds.  I don't know who that woman was.  When he had 16.  Yeah.  All right, well, you go find the photographer.  Yeah.  We're going to take a break, and when we come back, the after show will technically...  This is technically still Opian Anthony, because there's been no break.  Right.  So the after show will start, and then we'll get an update.  Maybe we can play a little Lady Gaga in the background while we're talking, because Opian  Anthony want to be fucking heterosexual men. 
[03:50:30]  How about we act like girls?  I don't know if you noticed this.  Eric doesn't like playing beds.  Fucking Ewa.  Let me tell you something.  He never plays beds.  He did play Blaine Shelton in bed.  Do you know how many times you have to mention a song before?  I mentioned fucking Proud Mary 30 times.  I'm like, do we have...  But you know what?  You started moving on to other things.  No, we talked about it for an hour.  You were spelling Proud, P-R-O-W-D, and you couldn't find it.  Plus, when the music comes on, you know, the performers, Opian Anthony and Jim, will hear 
[03:51:00]  that, and if there's something there, move back towards it, because they'll say, oh, now  there's some music accompanying this.  We could make it into a bit.  I want my birthday picture!  It is Jim Norton's birthday week.  We're going to take a break.  I love that that annoys Opian so much.  Because it's just such a child thing to say.  Let me ask, did you want an ice cream cake, or do you want an ice box cake?  Neither, because I'm shooting this week.  I can't have either one.  I swear to God, all my gassers are terrible.  You're shooting this week, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't celebrate and treat yourself  to one piece of cake. 
[03:51:30]  I've been treating myself for almost 43 years.  I've never not treated myself.  That's my problem.  I'm a giant id.  So did you want a cake tomorrow?  Yes, ice cream cake.  Ice cream cake.  Not for me, for the gang.  But did you want an ice box cake, though?  What's an ice box?  It's like, it's almost, the Magnolia sells it.  It's like a puree, but it's cold.  Surprise me.  It's delicious.  Surprise me.  We'll do ice cream cake.  But ice box cake, because they're going to wash their weights, and they'll be like,  oh, I'm fed.  Ice cream cake.  Whatever you guys say, I don't know.  What the heck?  With crunches.  Yes!  Carvel.  Yeah, but I'll eat all.  Carvel's awful, though. 
[03:52:00]  My farts will be atrocious.  What?  Yeah, but that's a treat for all of us.  No, Carvel's good, but for their cakes, they're like, no, that was crunches.  Do you know Opie or Anthony, neither one of them owes each other money, because we don't  know what's going to happen with this picture.  That's right.  Well, let's take a break.  Right now, Anthony is fucking doing 170 down the LIE.  Yeah.  Fucking listening to this nonsense.  Then again, you think Opie and Anthony are going home concerned about 100 bucks?  Who took the picture of the TV?  I do.  I do.  It was a TV picture.  Oh, that's me and Rickles. 
[03:52:30]  That's from the promo.  I Twittered that, but I chopped the rest of it.  You could see Bristol Pale and all of them.  But that's what you do.  That's where the band plays.  You stand there at the end.  For all the commercials?  For the news?  Yeah, and then Jay goes, hey, here's what we got coming up, and we all stand there,  and Rickles was joking around.  But he had his arm around me.  It was so fucking nice.  Talked to a great, great comic like that.  Sway's first day is today on Shade 45.  Who's Sway?  He used to be on MTV News.  I don't know if he still is or not, but he's on TV.  Did he come in yet?  Yeah, he's doing the morning show now.  I think I said hello to him. 
[03:53:00]  I think so.  He's a black guy with a hat?  Yeah, he was saying hi to everyone.  Okay, yeah.  But he was lingering, trying to get a little look at Gaga, seeing, I don't know.  Everybody was, dude.  Yeah.  You hope that she's a giant fucking celebrity.  Yeah, people, I mean.  And I like her.  I like seeing, I like her music.  I was telling Ross, I'm not being ironic.  I genuinely like her.  Like, I like her fucking music.  I think it's well established that I do as well.  Yes, you do.  But you're more expected to.  I didn't see you with a picture.  Yeah, because I'm nobody.  Oh, that's right.  Okay, was that an insult because I, because you agreed with what I said? 
[03:53:30]  No.  Okay.  We're going to go to break.  Yes.  We're going to try to find the photographer.  Yes.  And we're going to come back with an update.  Yes.  So stay right there.  We'll be right back.  The Opinion Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  We'll be right back. 
[03:54:00]  We'll be right back. </pre>
