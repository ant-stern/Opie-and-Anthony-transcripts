<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie recounting embarrassing encounters: an awkward elevator ride with interns sporting oversized name tags, followed by a self-inflicted turnstile injury.  The conversation quickly shifted to the MTV Movie Awards, specifically Sacha Baron Cohen's (as Bruno) controversial stunt involving Eminem.  Opie, Anthony, and Sam debated whether the incident was staged, concluding it likely was due to its orchestration and Eminem's lack of violent response.  They then parodied the event with exaggerated dialogue.  The show then discussed President Obama's Broadway trip, focusing on the exorbitant security costs. This segued into a broader debate on presidential spending and public perception.

Next, a shooting involving a black plainclothes officer shot by a white officer in East Harlem was discussed. The hosts explored the complexities of the incident, highlighting the immediate reactions of activists like Al Sharpton, the potential for misidentification, and the challenges faced by off-duty officers.  Callers, including police officers, offered their perspectives on training and racial implications, while Charlie Rangel's controversial comments were also mentioned. The show briefly touched on a Megan Fox video and a missing plane off the Brazil coast before moving to a list of the top 10 most influential stand-up comedians of the 2000s from TheLaughTrack.com, sparking a debate on the list's criteria and questionable inclusions/exclusions.

The discussion then turned to Britain's Got Talent's 2009 results, specifically Diversity's win over Susan Boyle. The hosts expressed strong disapproval of this outcome, disparaging dance troupes while acknowledging Boyle's gracious response and subsequent stress-related hospitalization.  Listener calls followed, covering Eminem and Bruno Mars's VMA performance (with commentary on Eminem's bodyguards), Dave Attell's New York comedy scene prominence, and Octomom's reality show aspirations.  The hosts debated various reality shows, expressing strong negative opinions about Gene Simmons and Ozzy Osbourne.  A "Top 10 Albums of the 2000s" segment revealed Eminem as the top seller, surprising the hosts given the presence of numerous country artists and The Beatles' high placement.  This led to discussions about Ozzy Osbourne's failed variety show, American Idol contestants (Ruben Studdard, Taylor Hicks), strategic runner-up manipulation, and "literal" YouTube music video narrations (featuring Bonnie Tyler and A-ha, with crude comments about Kelly Clarkson).  The segment concluded with box office numbers and jokes about Kim Jong-il's alleged golfing prowess, using offensive language.


The next segment began with one host deeming a Bruce Springsteen concert "fucking bored," transitioning to a discussion of the Bangles' Sirius appearance and the band members' aging.  The conversation then shifted to North Korea, specifically Kim Jong-il's alleged obsessions, with a caller ("Cock Sock") offering commentary from near the North/South Korean border.  A "Backstage with O&A" segment featured a lengthy, sexually suggestive debate about executive producer Steve C.'s capri shorts, involving numerous studio staff members and a visual examination.  This was interspersed with call-in segments, followed by a guest appearance from UFC fighter Forrest Griffin.  The conversation with Griffin covered his career, dislike for unsolicited fight advice, skydiving, video games, the missing Air France plane, and the NBA playoffs, all peppered with crude jokes and sexually explicit remarks.  Little Nicky, a SiriusXM listener, also made a brief appearance.


The following segment continued with Forrest Griffin as the guest.  The discussion covered his relationships with other fighters (especially Rampage Jackson), pre- and post-fight feelings, the book "Godfights," and the bizarre anecdote of losing a testicle due to a powerlifting injury.  This led to a discussion of his sexual experiences, including a woman slapping and biting his remaining testicle, Chuck Palahniuk's books ("Choke"), and extensive mocking of Steve's capri pants, including a phone call from Steve himself and his subsequent dispatch to a gay-themed radio show for pants critique.  The conversation also covered injuries sustained during fights, his fighting style, a rumor about him liking to get punched early in fights, and his experiences paying strippers to punch him.  Callers shared their interactions with Griffin.  The segment concluded with discussions of Griffin's book "Got Fight," book signings, continued mockery of Steve's capri pants, an audio clip of a man having sex with a chicken (causing Griffin's discomfort), and Francine, a show employee, recounting her dating life and sexual experiences.


The final segment focused intensely on Steve's capri pants, debating their origin and size with relentless teasing and homophobic and misogynistic language.  Callers joined the discussion, including Francine, who shared her views on a Supreme Court nominee, Obama's choice of Sotomayor, a gay priest, and her own sexually explicit personal history, including contracting chlamydia at 14.  The hosts and callers responded with crude jokes.  A final caller suggested Francine might have been sexually abused, leading to further speculation and jokes. The segment concluded with more discussion of Steve's pants, additional caller interactions, and Francine's continued candid discussion of her sex life.  The overall tone remained highly informal, vulgar, and sexually explicit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Opie and Anthony, and we do it again.  Another week. Week 8,600 and...  Who knows?  The interns have huge signs on them, the brand new interns.  Oh, I know. Yeah, I got the privilege of riding up in the elevator with them. 
[00:00:30]  God, I was just...  I come in, and I get my little beep card thing, and I get to the elevators,  and I saw that there was a new batch of interns, because they all had...  And it wasn't even a piece of paper.  It's a full sheet of notebook paper with their name on it smashed on their chest.  They look ridiculous.  Yeah. So I beep through the turnstile with my card, and I see the door's shut, and I'm like, oh, good.  And then, boom, I see a hand come out, and the door opens, and now I'm like... 
[00:01:00]  Now I got to ride up with the new interns, and I don't know what to say.  It's all awkward.  It's a chore for you?  It's a chore, because they just... It doesn't matter.  I'm like, well, 36th floor.  And they feel compelled to laugh, because I'm me.  It's a chore to ride up with some good... I don't know.  Some youngsters.  Some youngsters.  Yeah, they're all full of piss and vinegar, and I'm just aggravated to be here.  I took a... 
[00:01:30]  Teasing, of course.  I took a ball shot through the turnstile today.  Oh, that's...  You gotta time that perfectly.  I saw green.  You gotta hip it, though.  I saw green.  I go, Kenny, I think there's a delay.  Like, you put your card, and then the turnstile allows you to push through, and I push through  right into my balls.  Never go...  Took a nice ball shot this morning.  Never go ball first into a turnstile.  You always lead with your hip.  Lead with your hip, you give it a little hip check, and then you straighten out.  Oh.  If you lead with your balls, you're looking for trouble.  I'm my ball shot every morning, because it wakes the fuck up. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, it'll wake you up.  Out of here.  To wake her up again.  Oh, my God.  I'm wide awake now.  Thank you.  Thank you to that.  Hey, uh, you know, I didn't see it, and thank God we have Sam and the rest of these guys.  To debunk things for us.  Yeah, the MTV Movie Awards happened last night, and we want to be the first to do this.  I guess Bruno...  Yeah.  ...came down from the sky as an angel.  Oh, is that what he was supposed to be, an angel?  Well, he had some kind of wings, right? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, he did.  He had these, uh, white feather wings.  Sacha Bourne calling Bruno.  Bruno, of course.  And what, he had wings?  Yeah, he had wings.  He was like a, like an angel slash Cupid type deal with it.  All right.  Yeah.  Not much on the lower half.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, his ass is completely hanging out.  Yeah.  So I'm sure somebody's going to be like, whoo-hoo, ripped me off.  Whoo-hoo, I did it first, Robin.  Someone out there, tell us how long it takes Howard to say, Bruno ripped him off.  Well, uh, obviously, uh, uh, this is a rip-off of Fartman, Robin, which I did, uh, back in 
[00:03:00]  the 80s.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  That's absolutely, he's going to say that.  He probably started his show with that.  Probably already did, yeah.  He couldn't wait to get on.  Um, but then he lands on Eminem, and this story is everywhere.  The newspapers in New York here, page three, uh, Bruno, Sasha Bourne, uh, uh, uh, Sasha  Baron Cohen, uh, lands on Eminem with his ass, and then gets roughed up by Eminem's, what, 
[00:03:30]  posse?  Eminem leaves angry.  And just, and just storms out.  Yeah.  All right.  Um, Sam brought it to our attention.  We all saw the video.  So, this is so fake.  It's so set up.  It's rigged.  This was supposed to happen exactly like it did.  It's a wrestling angle.  And that's why I think Sam, uh, picked up on it so well.  Um, yeah.  I mean, it's obvious, even without even looking at the video, just from the politics of it, 
[00:04:00]  what would MTV benefit by purposely pissing off the biggest star in music?  MTV, that's not the type of network they are.  They never do that, and they never will.  Yeah, they don't want to piss off Eminem.  No, no.  Eminem, you're right.  And on the front page, what, MTV.com is a picture of, of, of Bruno's naked butt in Eminem's  face.  In Eminem's face.  So now they're rubbing it in that this happened to Eminem.  Plus the fact, uh, it was pointed out, as Bruno was kind of falling from the sky slowly, 
[00:04:30]  they had a shot of Eminem, like, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, could this happen?  What are they doing?  The whole crowd's still obviously there.  And then, uh, Sasha comes over.  And then he seems to have a problem with his, uh, his, uh, lines, his wires that's flying  him in.  And he starts, like, turning over and going, uh-oh, uh-oh, but staying in character and  everything.  And then while he's still way over the crowd, they stop and zoom in on Eminem's face where  he's looking up going like, what? 
[00:05:00]  See, look at that shot.  Yeah.  And he's like, well, what's going on?  And if you saw the guy coming down as slowly as he was, wouldn't you get up out of your  seat and go, look, he's coming right down on top of me.  Look, he stays there and gets in the 69 position.  Spreads his legs so there's a spot for his head to land.  Of course.  And it's also ridiculous because Eminem, if that really happened, his fucking guys would  have knocked his teeth out.  Oh, forget about it.  Dude, look how they push.  Yeah, they push him around.  Look how they push and spin him around on his head. 
[00:05:30]  He would have got a beating like fucking when that parachuter landed during the Holyfield  fight or the, uh, remember the fucking beat that guy almost to death.  There's nothing.  He'd have gotten the bodyguards are just kind of spinning him around and pushing him.  And then there's Eminem, man, I'm out of here.  And then Eminem leaves, bad actor style.  Terrible.  With a camera following him up the stairs.  Like all the camera people were set to be in the perfect spots.  Well, which is fine.  What pisses me off is that the regular newspapers are picking this up like it's a real thing. 
[00:06:00]  Hip-hop bodyguards love having an excuse to beat the shit out of someone.  They love when somebody puts the safety in jeopardy so they can legitimately punch you  as hard as they can.  It's their job.  And they normally don't get to exercise the use of beating people up.  They would just shove him away like he's a giant fucking wind chime, spinning him in  a circle.  He put his ass in the boss's face.  Spin him around, boys.  But it is so fake. 
[00:06:30]  Not many.  Not many.  I haven't seen one site or newspaper report this as a fake thing that MTV and Eminem did  together with Bruno there.  They think it's real?  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.  It's real.  Yeah.  Look right there.  Did they look?  Which paper was it that reported as real?  Yeah, page three.  You're right.  But of joke.  It's like, what?  This guy went down.  The audio version, anyway.  It's been Davos P.  It's been Bruno. 
[00:07:00]  It's...  Ah!  Shreysen!  Shreysen!  Ah!  Ah!  My kugel suck!  My kugel suck!  The blood is...  The fire is...  Drop me!  Let me down!  But if the fire is...  You're on my...  You're on my kugel.  My kugel suck!  My kugel suck!  My kugel is losing!  My kugel...  My kugel...  Was that?  What?  Ah so!  Eminem, nice to meet you!  Are you serious?  Ah, ah so!  I'm f***ing you!  No!  This is my kugel!  This is my kugel! 
[00:07:30]  Ah, ah so!  Hey, don't touch me, guys!  I've already got a boyfriend!  Hey, guys, let's continue this in my hotel room!  Ah, is it real schlimm?  I didn't want to stand up!  Ah so!  What is it?  Ah!  I've lost a kugel sack!  My Fleischwaffer had...  They have punched him so hard.  The winner is Zack Efron!  For High School Musical!  Just spitting him around. 
[00:08:00]  Well, I think they're trying to play off a thing like a couple years ago at one of the MTV Awards things, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog came over to Eminem.  Yes, of course.  But Eminem hit the puppet harder than he hit Bruno.  Yeah, yeah.  And Bruno's asshole was in his face!  Good point, Sam.  But what the hell?  They're trying to get something edgy done.  Yeah.  Planned Edge.  Woo!  Wow.  Because I think they missed the days when these award shows that MTV were putting out there, you know, they were cool to watch. 
[00:08:30]  Real spontaneity.  Because you didn't know what the hell was going to happen.  Right.  The guys were getting up there drunk.  There were fights in the stands.  Yeah.  So now they're coming up with Fake Edge to keep us talking about it.  It was real spontaneity back then, and now, not so much.  Now you just don't get anything.  I like Sacha Baron-Cock.  I love his characters.  I just don't...  I don't like when anyone else is in on the gag.  I don't like when it's...  That's why I didn't like the movie.  It didn't suck.  I just prefer it when it's just completely awkward, and I don't want a storyline. 
[00:09:00]  I just want him annoying the shit out of people, for real.  There you go.  Yeah.  All right.  So we get that out of the way.  I was just amazed that the paper was, you know, reporting this.  Even the internet thinks it's real.  The internet's thinking that it's real?  Come on.  A bunch of blogs are saying that, like, it's real, and all the comments and all the videos  are idiots that go like, oh, dude, Eminem should sue Eminem.  Sam's the perfect guy to figure this out, too, because he is a pro with wrestling.  He knows everything about wrestling.  Oh, I told you, man, he was a pro with man-ass.  With 69ing other men. 
[00:09:30]  It looked like a wrestling bit.  In what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a good wrestling bit.  It was probably called Vince McMahon.  Yeah.  Look, Vince, well, you want to do a little something-something at the movie awards.  Put Bruno's ass in Eminem's face.  Yeah.  I need to somehow figure out how to get Bruno's ass in Eminem's face.  I'm going to send a few of your people so we can block this out perfectly for the cameras  and everything else.  All right.  Phony.  Phony.  And my bit.  Guaranteed, he's starting to show. 
[00:10:00]  They're ripping me off.  They're just looking for another outrageous moment.  So they fly someone in with their butt hanging out.  Who did that, Robin Wright?  Oh, you're right, Howard.  You're always right.  I've never disagreed with you.  Of course.  I'm a genius.  Right again.  Oh, Jesus.  Someone disagree with the guy one time. 
[00:10:30]  Once.  I would have respect for anybody on that show.  All you have to do is disagree with him one time.  Just once.  Like Jackie.  Where are we at?  Oh, so Obama.  Yeah.  Obama took a nice little trip to New York City.  He certainly did.  You know, he promised Ms. Obama, the Mrs., that he would take her to a Broadway show when  all the hoopla of the election was over with. 
[00:11:00]  So he did that.  It's very sweet.  It's very nice.  It's got to suck to be the president because there's a few things we're going to do with  this, but you want to go to a Broadway show.  Did you see what they did in this city so Obama could go to a Broadway show?  Of course.  They turned Times Square basically into a ghost town so Obama can enjoy a Broadway show.  They shut down Times Square on a Saturday night.  Pretty much.  I mean, you know, the area.  Pretty much.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  I mean.  That's going to suck.  Like, you can't just like, hey, let's go to a Broadway show.  It's got to be this whole thing.  What the?  That is set up.  Who the?  What the?  How about you go to a Tuesday matinee?  Yeah.  When there's no one around.  You just go Tuesday afternoon.  You sneak in real quick in a hat.  Well, they were having a date night.  It just.  They flew in from Washington and flew out, I think, at midnight.  Right.  And it isn't just that.  The thing that got me was, now, relatively speaking, doesn't sound like that much, does 
[00:12:00]  it?  $25,000.  For what?  That's what it costs.  The taxpayers.  It's got to cost way more than that.  For him to do the show.  What about all the cops and all that?  Overtime.  Well, yeah.  I'm sure it costs them more.  I think, directly, though, like, without the overtime for the cops and everything.  Had to be more than that.  But the taxpayer is paying money so he can see a Broadway show with his wife in this time  when they're raising taxes and everything. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, the president has to stay in the White House.  Sorry.  We all can't go out anymore now like we want to because you've got to cut corners.  So does the president.  He shouldn't be able to go out to a Broadway show with his wife on the taxpayer's dime  when everybody's crying poverty.  He should set an example.  He should set an example.  There's plenty of entertainment in the White House.  There's a movie theater in there, I hear.  A bowling alley, perhaps.  Cable TV.  Cable.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:13:00]  And I'm sure he could get screener copies of whatever he wants.  With high-def channels?  Yeah.  With the whole picture, not half the picture screener copies.  I'm sure Obama's not on a torrent somewhere trying to find a movie.  You don't think he's watching half a Star Trek somewhere?  No, he's not.  Eating wheat pretzels.  You don't think he's watching Spock and Kirk up from the cab to the shin?  Wow, those are great feet on Spock when he was younger.  What is that?  Is that a ship or a bowling ball? 
[00:13:30]  I can't see.  He can't.  Look.  So you're not happy with the Obama visit there?  No, not happy with it at all.  Stay in the White House.  Stay in D.C.  If it was Bush and his wife, would you be happy?  No.  You'd be just as mad?  I used to get pissed when he'd come into town because it was a big hoopla and traffic and everything else.  Well, he just shuts down the entire city.  When the president decides to visit your town or city, isn't it fun for everyone?  Yeah, it's just a laugh riot. 
[00:14:00]  It's just a laugh riot.  I think that it is possible that it will stimulate more than $25,000 in business on Broadway?  Because they said that people are lining up now to go to this show.  The restaurant he was in, people.  Now, just for those two, but it's just going to stimulate business in the area.  I'm wondering if people just go out.  And they're like, oh, Obama was there.  They'll just go out.  Well, you know what?  Obama said that people shouldn't, corporations should not go to Las Vegas for their business meetings.  And what happened was a bunch of companies canceled their planned Las Vegas meetings and junkets and whatnot, 
[00:14:30]  which cost Vegas a shitload of money.  Yeah.  Now, what happens to that business?  That's the same thing.  All right.  They come there.  Oh, it's costing the taxpayers money or the shareholders, actually.  And then by proxy, the taxpayers, because they pay to bail these companies out.  So when they go on these junkets, it's like the taxpayers are paying. 
[00:15:00]  That's why I get pissed when Obama does this, because he's doing the same thing and taxpayers are paying.  But, you know, what about the people that lost work in Vegas because of the junkets that canceled and things like that?  I mean, there's plenty of business.  They said they lost hotels, conference centers.  It's true.  I think he was attacking.  I agree with him on that.  These companies are like they're borrowing money from the public.  And they just treat it.  He's not saying don't go to Vegas. 
[00:15:30]  He's saying that they waste all this money lavishly spending it.  He probably picked a stupid example of Vegas.  But when the president travels, it's going to cost money.  Especially when you go to Vegas for a fundraiser right after you say a comment like that.  Yeah, it's probably the smartest place.  Yeah.  It costs a lot of money.  I don't know.  I'm just going to always be critical of him.  I understand that.  That's my position.  He is the biggest target on the planet.  We kind of have to, like, fly him privately.  It's not like, hey, look, you want to talk shit, Mr. President?  Get in line on Continental.  I say stay in the White House. 
[00:16:00]  Stay in the White House.  Video conference.  Sorry.  Fox 5 locally, Channel 5 locally is going to do a story on the Bruno thing.  I need to see how these guys report this today.  Oh, let's see how they...  I'm obsessed with the Eminem Bruno's ass story.  Let's see how they report it and if they report it as real.  I was reading about the Obama visit.  He was at a restaurant after the play.  Yeah.  And this has got to be the weirdest thing.  He's sitting in the restaurant with his wife, right?  And everybody in the restaurant knew he was there, but no one wanted to acknowledge that 
[00:16:30]  he was there.  Oh, no.  So he's sitting there trying to have a nice, like, romantic dinner with his wife, but everyone  in the place is aware.  And then when he got up to leave, then everyone finally stood up and gave him a standing ovation  and freaked out.  Like, ah...  But they were trying to give him his, like, you know, his privacy, even though they had  to be gawking the whole time he was in there.  I would have been the asshole that Secret Service had to take out because I wanted a picture  with him.  Ah, can I get a...  That's going to be the only chance, right? 
[00:17:00]  Dumbest motherfucker alive, Keith Robinson, he doesn't know if he has an Obama picture.  Why?  What happened?  Because he was...  Wanda's assistant, I think, was supposed to take it, but he didn't bring his own camera.  Oh, no.  He didn't.  So it might be out there somewhere.  He doesn't know.  Like, there's a picture I saw, I think, where he's standing next to Michelle.  It was, like, in the room he talked about where Tom Cruise was and all these people.  Sure.  And he doesn't know if he has an Obama picture.  I'm like, what the...  You met the president, you idiot.  And you know the person that took the picture is just the leading picture. 
[00:17:30]  Because Wanda's not in a man.  She's not going to do this one and this one.  And there it is.  Poof.  Yeah.  Gone.  But they might not even take it.  They're probably worried about Wanda.  Let's make sure she's taken care of.  Sure.  Not, can I take a picture of Dummy?  Unbelievable.  Dummy.  What's he doing?  And this Wrangler.  Wrangle?  Wrangle.  Sorry, Wrangle.  I was the Wrangler back on CBS Radio Days.  Charlie Wrangler.  Shouldn't he be arrested for what he's saying?  You can't joke about...  I don't even want to say what he was joking about.  It did sound like a veiled threat of some sort. 
[00:18:00]  Well, unfortunately, we had a black cop shot by a white cop in where?  East Harlem?  Yeah, when that happens.  A couple days ago.  Oh, boy.  It was a complete accident.  Unfortunately, you know, Reverend Al Sharpton's yelling and screaming and he's in the streets  already with his horrendous bullhorn.  Yeah.  But the amount of money this guy makes, you think he would get a better system to talk  to his people.  You don't like his bullhorn?  Oh, it's horrendous.  And what did Wrangle say? 
[00:18:30]  Basically, he said if Obama was in East Harlem, there's a chance he would be shot at by a cop  or something?  Yeah, he said something to the effect of, you know...  Wrangle is a politician here in New York.  That Obama shouldn't go to the Bronx.  And it's almost like, wow, like a veiled threat.  It sounds like a threat.  It sounds like something the Secret Service might pop in on if you were a civilian and  said it.  Of course.  But Charlie Wrangle's saying it.  Oh, because he's saying.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Because Charlie Wrangle's saying.  Makes certain he doesn't run around East Harlem without identification.  This is an obviously sad situation for everybody involved.  A black cop was shot.  He was in plain clothes, giving chase, I guess, to a car thief.  White cops saw this happening.  On foot, by the way.  Yeah.  The car thief was trying to get a car.  It didn't happen.  He sees it happening, you know, kind of, I guess, gets a little confused as to who's 
[00:19:30]  who, and sees a black guy with a gun.  I don't know what the circumstances are, if the guy turned around, if, you know, if it  was this justified kind of he felt a threat to his life, I'm sure he's going to say yes.  And he shot the guy and wound up killing him.  And it turns out he was the plain clothes cop and not the perp.  So, um, uh, a lot of people are angry. 
[00:20:00]  A lot of black activists are angry.  A lot of black cops are angry that, um, this happened.  And they say something has to be done to keep this from happening.  Now, I don't know what could be done, aside from the fact of the white cop putting himself  in more danger by maybe not acting quickly enough while he assesses if this is a cop  or, uh, an armed criminal waiting to kill him. 
[00:20:30]  Uh, I think the only way this actually gets dealt with is by the majority of people in  the Bronx that do commit crimes and maybe do pop off pot shots at police officers are not  black men anymore.  Perhaps that will make it easier for the cops to not shoot armed black men when the majority  of people shooting at them are armed black men. 
[00:21:00]  Again, very sad for the family of the black officer, uh, the family of the white officer.  His career's done.  Uh, you know, it's one of these situations.  Friendly fire stuff is terrible when it happens with cops.  Um, but, uh, you know, again, I think if, if, uh, politicians wrangle at Reverend Al, if  they want to step in and have something done for this situation, educate your community  and your constituency on the fact that the reason this happens, uh, is primarily because 
[00:21:30]  not because these cops are going, boy, I sure wish, uh, I could go out and shoot some black  people tonight.  Uh, that's always seems to be what, what the activists think is going through the mindset  of these, uh, white or Hispanic cops or Asian cops when they shoot a black, uh, uh, person.  They think, uh, let me go out and ruin my career.  Let me completely destroy my life.  Maybe end up in prison and take the life of, of an innocent person instead of, you know, 
[00:22:00]  wow, that was a fucked up mistake I made.  Um, here's the situation as to why it happened.  Let's look at that and see how we can change it.  That's one thing I agree with wrangle and, and Reverend Al and stuff.  Something needs to be changed, but I don't think it's within the, um, police department.  I think it's within the community and, uh, uh, teaching people the dangers, not only of,  of, uh, direct danger of, of going out with, with guns and, and shooting at police officers 
[00:22:30]  and innocent people and, uh, other drug dealers on the street, uh, not those direct dangers,  but also the danger it puts innocent black people in when they are confronted by police  officers because so many times in these, uh, uh, bad areas as they call them, they're confronted  with, uh, armed black, young black men who are armed, who want to kill them.  Why can't one time something like this happen and wrangle or Sharpton when it's obvious what 
[00:23:00]  it was, no cop wants to just be out on patrol and shoot another cop.  Oh, why can't for once they say it was a terrible mistake.  Uh, he was chasing a suspect.  It was not, it was not racially motivated.  Why can't one time they understand that a cop now knows he shot another cop and it obviously  wasn't perfect.  Why would you do that as a cop?  For what reason?  You think this cop is now like, oh, well, that happened.  This guy is gotta be devastated. 
[00:23:30]  Uh, like I said, you know, his, his whole life has been turned upside down.  The other guy obviously dead.  That's, that's even worse for him and, and his family, you know, and a wife and two kids.  Uh, but you know, it's, it's, it's, that's why it's, it's, it's an all around tragedy.  So why then put the, the other cop through the ringer?  Uh, I'm sure he's going through hell right now knowing that he killed a fellow officer.  So I don't know, but the, well, the father-in-law, the father-in-law, I'm sorry. 
[00:24:00]  No, that's okay.  I'm sorry.  No, the father-in-law of the shot cop is, uh, is, is a cop himself.  Um, he, apparently he's a, his father-in-law is a cop from 67th precinct in Brooklyn.  And he, uh, he said, we're trying to understand everything that happened.  Yeah.  And, uh, the officer knows what happened that night.  He said of done Dunton, he has a lot to think about for himself.  My heart goes out to him.  He made a mistake.  Um, he, he's an, I'm going to entrust it in the investigation.  That sounds good.  You wait, you see what the actual circumstances were that led up to this. 
[00:24:30]  And then you assess, you don't jump right out.  Like a Reverend out wanting an independent commission, uh, to investigate.  Yeah.  I wonder what that independent commission would look like.  Reverend Al, would you be on it?  Reverend Al was out there literally three hours later.  Oh, please.  Getting that frigging mug of his on the news.  Unbelievable.  All right.  You get it.  I was, uh, golfing with two state troopers.  I was telling Anthony yesterday and they said, man, that off duty stuff, when I see stuff  going down, know what I do. 
[00:25:00]  And he, he pulls out his cell phone and goes, nine, one, one, one, it's, it's not worth it.  See, it's not worth it.  Cause it's hard to explain, tell the cops sometimes that you're a cop off duty.  I'm a cop.  You, especially when all hell is breaking loose.  Yeah.  It's not a casual traffic stop where you have maybe a little time.  Go, Hey, need any assistance?  I'm an off duty cop, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's, you know, life is happening in front of you and you're an off duty cop  and you could get mixed up in this stuff very easily. 
[00:25:30]  Life or death.  And mistaken.  You just hope you're, your training is good enough that you, uh, can make these split  second decisions that involve life and death, uh, correctly.  And when you make a mistake like that, there's no turning back.  You know, the guy, the guy made a mistake and, uh, he's going to be paying for that one.  We got a cop on the line, Terry in Ohio.  Terry.  Hey, love the show.  Hey, Terry.  Hey, ma'am.  I wanted to make a comment that, uh, what people don't realize is, is that police officers 
[00:26:00]  are out there to stop the serious bodily threat to somebody or, or death.  So if he sees somebody holding a gun to someone else, of course, he's going to act.  Of course, he's going to shoot them.  He doesn't, you know, if you just see someone pointing a gun at somebody, you're going to  pretty much take them out.  Well, it's not the, it's not the movies.  I hate using that cliche, but you know, in real life, and we've seen a lot of these based  on, uh, dashboard cams on cars.  Uh, a lot of these, uh, shows that you watch, um, uh, besides cops, but yeah, there's a lot 
[00:26:30]  of those like shows that show dashboard cams and show what a real gunfighter  looks like between a cop and, uh, uh, perpetrator, a bad guy, somebody that he pulled over.  They're very fast.  They happen within a split second and, uh, a, a, a bunch of shots are traded.  It's not this take aim and shoot thing.  It's very, it's very panicked the whole thing.  Yep.  And in the end, you got to sort out what happened. 
[00:27:00]  And, uh, you know, sometimes there's mistakes.  It's terrible.  But, and if that guy didn't like, I don't know what happened between the two cops.  Obviously he didn't know where he wouldn't have shot.  Yeah.  But if it was say a criminal attacking a citizen and that cop waited too long and the criminal  shot the citizen and then the cop shot the criminal, people would say, because he was  black, you didn't act fast enough.  You didn't value the life of the citizen on the ground fast enough.  It took a no way situation.  And Charlie Rangel is such a bum.  He's such a fucking bum.  He can make a joke about the president getting shot in Harlem after a black cop was shot in 
[00:27:30]  a terrible mistake.  Imus gets done.  We keep going back to Imus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, let's see what happens to him.  Patterson won't criticize him.  Nope.  The only one who criticized him is stupid Bloomberg.  Bloomberg criticized him.  Patterson just said, well, we'll see what the jury says.  Unbelievable.  Oh, no, Obama's going to say.  Obama's not going to say nothing.  Of course not.  But a radio jock does it.  Fired.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Bobby from the NYPD.  Bobby.  Hey there, Bobby. 
[00:28:00]  What's up, boys?  Hey, Bobby.  Yeah, two quick things.  There's a reason why Sharpton and Barron and Rangel and all these racial hucksters aren't  going to point out reality to the minority community.  Because there's no financial gain in it.  You know, it's so obvious.  You know, and one other thing is, one other thing is a recent, recently an NYPD historian  went through the books.  I'm talking about the last two or three days, went through the books and determined that  up to 15 white cops, you know, either on duty or off duty in plainclothes have been 
[00:28:30]  killed in the line of duty.  And these guys, I think it was, I think it was, I think it was Sharpton who was saying,  you know, why is it never, why is it never a white plainclothes cop?  Well, if you go back to the inception of NYPD in the late 1800s, up to 15 plainclothes white  cops have been killed in the line of duty.  You've got to go to the 1800s, though?  Wait, 15 since the 1800s?  That doesn't really, that's not a really good argument to bolster the case.  Well, sure it is.  Yeah, what do they got?  And you know, another thing is, you know, recently, was it last year on white planes, 
[00:29:00]  an off-duty black cop taking police action was shot, but it was by minority cops.  Right, yeah, yeah, so it wasn't that big a deal.  Right, right, cops and rolls, guys, they didn't, go ahead, I'm sorry.  No, I was going to say to you, you're absolutely right.  It happens where a black cop shoots a black cop, or even a Hispanic cop shoots a black  cop, and they go like, wow, that's tragic, and this shouldn't happen, but there isn't  this instant racism thing that comes into play that Reverend Al loves stirring that pot 
[00:29:30]  up with.  But when it's a white cop, forget about it.  Exactly, you know, and you know, guys, the black cops that I work with in the Bronx, you  know, all those guys know, because it's a high crime area, all those guys know, you know,  that the split-second decision-making, they know it was an accident.  None of those guys are walking around being militant and being angry, you know, it's not  a white cop versus black cop thing, you know.  It was a horrible mistake, and that poor kid that took that shot is going to have to deal  with that for a rest.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:30:00]  It's ruined.  It all depends on where you are.  Like, if you're in a neighborhood somewhere, like, let's just say we're in a neighborhood  where there's a lot of skinheads, and if I'm an off-duty cop and I'm running, and there's  a black cop and he sees me chasing somebody, he's probably going to assume that I am a guy  in the neighborhood because that's what the neighborhood is.  Right.  Great point, Jimmy.  Yeah, you got to look at where it happened and the crime statistics in the area that  it happened.  Like, there's a lot of considerations that have to be made when something like this  happens. 
[00:30:30]  But Reverend Al just jumps right out and cries racism, so.  There you go.  Wouldn't he one time or wrangle one time, say this was just the case of an officer?  We're still waiting for that one time, Jimmy.  It's never going to happen.  What do the cops hate this fuck?  It hasn't come close to happening.  No financial gain.  Thank you, Bobby.  I'll tell you another thing.  If I was a black cop in the Bronx, whether I'm off-duty or not, that vest would stay  on until I got to my apartment and locked the goddamn door. 
[00:31:00]  If you lived in that area, you'd have it on 24-7.  Yeah, yeah, and go to sleep with it on.  If you get a vest like that, why wouldn't you wear it all the time?  Just wear it all the time.  Plus, it looks like you've been working out.  Yeah.  Let's go to AJ.  He works for the New Jersey Police Department.  What's up, AJ?  Hey, how you doing?  All right, man.  I just wanted to say, I mean, this is a tragedy for all parties involved, obviously, but the  NYPD has had a lot of shootings involving off-duty cops, and I really think it has to go back  to training of the officers with regards to how they're going to act when they're off-duty. 
[00:31:30]  You have to take that extra time, if you're going to act, to decide whether or not you're  able to.  If you're not able to identify yourself clearly as a police officer, you do take that risk  of being shot as a potential perpetrator.  And I don't want to go into too much detail about how an officer should do that in a public  forum, but you have to make sure that if you're going to go and chase after that bad guy, that 
[00:32:00]  you have all the equipment and material you need to identify yourself before you do it.  And if you don't, you take that risk of winding up in this situation.  And if the uniform comes up on you, the first thing you do is stop, put that gun down, and  put your hands up.  I mean, there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Well, we've got to know what the circumstances were on this case, so we'll see if it was.  Well, Anthony, I'm sure you know. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, no cop in their right mind, like you said, is going to go out there saying that  they're going out to shoot a black guy.  No.  If you put your hands up, the fight's over.  Yeah.  They'll listen to whatever you've got to say, but once that gun's on the ground and your  hands are up, the situation's diffused.  Yeah, I hear you.  Absolutely.  Thank you, AJ.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  We could continue with that after the break.  Yeah.  Look at the new interns marching down the hall with them.  Oh, God, with all their paper on it. 
[00:33:00]  Look, they're full size.  Name tags.  Another Noah?  Yeah, I think so.  Is that what the three is under his name?  Yeah, Noah the third.  That's a good one.  Whoever was doing the name tags got it wrong, because he's actually the fourth one.  He's the fourth Noah?  What the hell's going on with the name Noah?  Noah likes the Opie and Anthony show.  We got a detective, but does he have something?  I can't go to him.  Jim, NYPD detective.  I don't know. 
[00:33:30]  It's still in the screening process.  Jim, what's going on?  I just want to hear you guys talk a little bit about this point.  If the white cop, without knowing any of the circumstances, was such a racist just because  he shot a black guy running down the street with a gun in his hand, why didn't he step  back and just see what that guy was going to do?  He was chasing another black man.  Yeah.  So if he's such a racist, why wouldn't he sit back and say, oh, look at this. 
[00:34:00]  Let me watch this black guy.  Black on black crime.  Let me watch this pan out.  Let me watch this pan out.  He took, on his off-duty time, he decided to intervene, and in his eyes, he was making  an effort to save a black guy from being a victim of crime.  Yeah.  Yep.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Yeah, you know, maybe sometimes when you're off-duty, you just don't take the initiative.  That's what we're getting, that's the point we're getting to with police officers. 
[00:34:30]  It's not worth the threat to their livelihood, perhaps their freedom, and perhaps their lives  to get involved with anything off-duty.  So why would you, like you were saying with the trooper, pull out your phone, dial 911,  and go home?  That's what he said.  That's what we're going to get to.  And does that make the streets safer?  I don't think so.  But then again, we were golfing and having a nice little time.  Yeah, I'm sure.  And the same trooper threatened to force him in front of us, so. 
[00:35:00]  That's great.  It's so funny.  We were on a real crowded golf course.  Maybe try to bring a little funny back.  And the force him in front of us, this is for all my golfers out there, and understands  too.  The force him in front of us was hitting like two balls each.  You can't do that.  And finally, after like five holes, the state trooper guy had it, and they had a confrontation. 
[00:35:30]  It's like, stop.  And these guys are talking.  Did he draw on them?  Well, these guys.  Hey, you.  Well, these guys are talking back not knowing they're messing with a state trooper that's  got some things on them.  I wouldn't doubt it.  So why don't you just pick up your dumb second ball and, you know, obey the rules of golf  and move on.  And then we got into talking on the same tee box about this situation.  He goes, you know what I do?  So I just called.  911.  I'm like, really?  Call the police. 
[00:36:00]  You were just in a confrontation right here on the golf course.  I want to say hi to Mike and Charlie.  Mike.  I went to golf with yesterday with my brother.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Morning, 6 to 11 a.m.  Live and uncensored.  The virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to everybody. 
[00:36:30]  How great is that Megan Fox video?  You're very nice.  Got to love the Twitter, man.  Chris Cornell does a song for the Megan Fox Esquire photo shoot.  But then the new thing is to make a video as well.  Not the new thing.  They've been doing it for a while.  Yeah.  And this video you can pretty much find anywhere.  And just Google Megan Fox Esquire video shoot, whatever.  You'll find it yourself. 
[00:37:00]  Just ridiculous.  Now we notice Megan Fox has like a big...  A big pussy mound.  Yeah, a pussy mound.  But now we're looking at Hayden Panateri's.  And it looks like she's got a schlong in her little bikini bottoms.  Maybe she's got a pad.  Oh, you know something?  Maybe she's leaking.  And she's got a maxi on.  She's flying on the wings of a maxi.  Yeah, that's too big to be a vagina.  Yeah, what's going on there?  It's creating a shadow on her leg.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty big. 
[00:37:30]  It looks...  I don't know.  There's something going on in the front of her pants.  Maybe she did that on purpose.  I'd put the whole fucking moundy mound in my mouth.  Of course.  And just go...  From belly button to knees.  Yes.  This just in.  Airplane just disappeared off the coast of Brazil.  Totally vanished off radar.  How big of a plane?  Good morning to you.  200 and some odd people on board.  Oh, it's a real...  What airline do we know? 
[00:38:00]  Air France.  Air France.  Air France.  Wow.  That's not a good sign.  No.  It doesn't all of a sudden go...  Oh, it's back.  It's back on the radar.  Yeah, it just dipped down for, you know, a few hours.  Maybe they were bored and they went and did some whale watching.  You think that's what they were doing over the ocean?  Whale watching?  I see a pod of whales.  We're going to go take a closer look.  Not a good sign.  Can you imagine the pilot decided to do that?  Like, just to go from 30,000 feet down to about 1,000 feet off the ocean and go check 
[00:38:30]  this shit out and then go back up.  How fast you'd get fired.  Oh, my God.  So fired.  With that kind of language.  The FAA.  Oh, they wouldn't be happy with you.  Plane full of passengers.  Yeah.  They're all screaming.  Skimming the water.  And you're just being, shut the fuck up back there.  You're ruining my fucking high.  Did this 1,000 times in the war.  Enough already.  What is this list?  Oh, because I've been...  Well, we're going to get to that in one second, Jim.  I just wanted, because the guys pulled it, I got a quickie and then we'll do the list. 
[00:39:00]  It's what?  The top 10...  The most influential comedians of the...  We'll do that literally in a minute.  Big story.  Bruno comes down from the ceiling of the movie awards there for MTV.  Yep.  And his ass ends up in Eminem's face.  It's the big story of the day.  In 69 position.  If you watch the video, it's so obviously fake and staged as this fake MTV outrageous moment.  That, you know, the ones that used to be real. 
[00:39:30]  Like when that lunatic...  What band was that?  Which one?  The guy that climbed up on one of the light fixtures and wouldn't come down.  Oh.  Yeah, it was Rage, right?  Yeah.  Rage Against the Machine.  Very good, Danny.  Security had to get him out.  Like, that was real.  That ruled.  That was a real moment.  That's like, wow, did you see that lunatic last night?  He climbed up the thing and wouldn't come down.  Well, what happened with MTV, their award shows used to be really cool because they were  very different than all the other award shows.  Yeah.  And then they started cleaning up their own award shows. 
[00:40:00]  So they weren't getting these outrageous moments anymore.  And then they're like, what's happening to the...  What's going on?  So now they're trying to stage outrageous moments.  Yeah.  And...  I mean, it was so obvious last night, now that we've gotten to see the video, as Bruno's  coming down from the sky, they have a shot of Eminem, like, uh-oh, could this possibly  happen?  Is he going to fall on Eminem?  And it's...  Yeah.  That's so dumb.  First of all, he's so high up at the point that they look at Eminem that you wouldn't 
[00:40:30]  even know he was coming down on Eminem.  Right.  Secondly...  You would never take a one shot of Eminem.  Why are they lowering him down?  Right.  On top of the audience.  Well, because Bruno was saying...  Uh-oh.  He was talking like there might be a problem with the rigging.  Well, if there was a problem with the rigging, you move him back to where he was.  That's all it is.  Like...  Of course.  It was stupid.  And the paper here in New York...  Move over an aisle.  A paper in New York reporting it as a real thing. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  And Fox 5 in New York has this to say.  Rapper Eminem was the butt, literally, of the jokes at MTV.  We get it.  Wow.  Oh, how many more people could use the butt of the joke?  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Slim Shady.  Ah.  Shade of...  Slim Shady.  Literally, of the jokes at MTV's awards last night.  And he apparently didn't appreciate it.  Actor Sacha Baron Cohen was dressed like an S&M angel. 
[00:41:30]  There he is, right there, flying over the audience.  Where?  Which one?  And he landed with his butt.  Literally, just inches from Slim Shady's face.  That's crazy, right?  Eminem seemed visibly upset.  Some say he was in on it.  Remember, he has a new album out.  Some say?  Some say.  How about you say?  Because it's obvious.  If you're a human being, you dopey newsreader.  How about Eminem says?  Yeah.  Eminem says it's fake.  Some say?  Maybe they put him right in on Eminem.  Maybe they got our show on in the newsroom. 
[00:42:00]  Some say he was in on it.  Remember, he has a new album out.  Sacha Baron Cohen has a movie out.  Others say that Eminem had no idea.  He and his entourage stormed out.  And some celebrity tweeters say that they think Eminem knew about the stunt,  but didn't know that Sacha Baron Cohen wouldn't have his pants on right in his face.  How about that?  Oh, boy.  And they were pushing him away.  Get away, man. 
[00:42:30]  Falling on Eminem.  Leave.  Instead of just making it a game where they stand about 12 feet apart  and punch Sacha in the face, send him to the other guy.  He punches him in the face back.  And they just knock him back and forth like that for a while.  They would turn him into a human pinata if it was real.  He'd be gone.  And these big, massive bodyguards just kind of storm out with Eminem.  No.  Their whole job is to make sure Eminem is not humiliated. 
[00:43:00]  With the camera right there in Eminem's face as he's walking up the stairs, too.  It looked like a wrestling work.  I would assume most people don't watch the local news anymore  because they're just a bunch of dopes, right?  Yeah.  You don't watch it for the news.  They're just a bunch of dopes.  You watch it for cheerleaders that come on or the new dance troupe from Broadway or something.  You don't watch it for the news.  You go to regular news channels for that.  Of course.  The 10 most influential stand-up comedians of the 2000s.  Oh, it is all stand-ups? 
[00:43:30]  Yes.  Okay.  And where's the list from?  ThelaughTrack.com.  I don't know what that is.  Okay.  I really don't either, but enough that it's me.  Who are the nine that come before Jimmy Norton?  Well, you know, Ant, I gotta say, I don't know if that's the case.  I would say yes.  I have a couple of guesses.  All right.  But since it's stand-ups, they're probably not.  I had Sacha Baron Cohen as one of them, but if they're only doing...  I don't know if he was a stand-up.  I don't think so.  Okay.  So is that a no?  Strike one for Jim Norton. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  But I didn't know if they were doing actors or not.  Two strikes to go.  Okay.  Dave Chappelle?  Number one.  You just fucked up the whole list.  I wouldn't have put him at number one.  He's not the most influential.  I wouldn't have put him at number one.  He's great, but he's not the most influential.  I got Dave Chappelle.  He's number one on the list.  Jon Stewart?  Strike two.  Stewart is not the fucking guy.  Are you kidding me?  The way he affects pop culture?  But stand-up comedians.  Yes.  He is a stand-up comedian.  But he's known more for The Daily Show than stand-up.  Oh, okay.  They're going pure...  All right.  I would think.  Okay.  I would think. 
[00:44:30]  Chris Rock is obvious.  Chris Rock...  Although you could say Chappelle was known more for The Chappelle Show than for his stand-up.  And what he did by leaving The Chappelle Show.  Right.  Of course he was.  All right.  Who's your third?  Chris Rock's good, right?  Nope.  Wow.  Bill Maher...  Nope.  You're kidding, right?  No.  These guys are not on the list?  No.  As most influential comics of the 2000s?  No.  Wow.  So Chappelle's on the list?  Yes.  Okay.  Chris Rock is not on the list?  No. 
[00:45:00]  Bill Maher, not on the list?  No.  Like or hate Bill Maher, he influences pop culture?  Hmm.  Okay.  Sarah Silverman.  Sarah Silverman is on the list.  Okay.  Number five.  Jay Leno.  Nope.  Ah, no influence.  He talks to fucking five million people a night.  No influence at all on pop culture.  None.  Who listens to Leno?  Five million people a day.  That's 25 million people a week.  But he has nothing to do with it.  Okay.  Dane Cook. 
[00:45:30]  Dane Cook is on the list.  Okay.  Number four.  Of course.  Yeah, he's been influential.  But Dane, see, the thing is, Dane's been more influential for other comedians in the  way that we market.  Like, everyone looked at, like, Dane after, like, because you knew his success, a lot of  it was MySpace, and a lot of it was by marketing and comics, but, holy fuck, why am I not doing  the things Dane is doing?  You could say that that's influential.  Very influential, yeah.  Of course.  But, I mean, it was more towards the most comedians.  Right.  You watch Comedy Central, it's the Dane Cook channel now.  Yes.  Because it's all young comedians doing Dane Cook.  Yes.  And if you look at...  It's amazing, actually. 
[00:46:00]  Janine Garofalo.  Nope.  Okay.  She's a pop culture reference, though.  People, like, you know, like, fucking Janine Garofalo.  You know, she is, whether people like her or not.  One of our regulars made the list.  Okay, well, hold on.  I would put Dave Attell.  Dave Attell is on the list.  Okay.  This is probably a Comedy Central-inspired list, then.  It seems like it is.  One of our regulars?  Okay.  Louis C.K.  Louis C.K.  Louis C.K.  is number 10 on the list.  Wow.  Okay.  Good for Louis.  Congrats to Louis C.K.  That chewed up is an amazing special, by the way. 
[00:46:30]  We got five so far.  Okay, we have...  Let me see.  We have one, two...  We only have one black guy, so there's got to be another black guy.  How the fuck is Chris Rock not on that list?  It's on the list with Jay Leno.  Dude!  But fucking Chris...  How is he not on the list?  I don't comprehend that.  This list is idiotic. 
[00:47:00]  Come on.  Let me see.  Another one...  Another guy that's done our show a handful of times.  D.L. Hughley.  D.L. Hugh...  Well, that's right.  D.L. has done our show as well.  He's part of the original Kings of Comedy.  Yes.  So they bunched them all together.  D.L., Cedric, Bernie, and Steve.  Okay.  Original Kings of Comedy, number two.  Okay.  How about Blue Collar Guys?  Hmm?  One of them made it.  Oh, okay.  Is it...  I would say probably in the last few years, it's probably going to be Foxworthy, but Larry 
[00:47:30]  the Cable Guy has been fucking a massive success.  But is it Foxworthy?  I'll say Jeff Foxworthy.  It's Larry the Cable Guy.  Is it really?  That was my first instinct.  I should have said that.  Number eight.  I should have said that.  Three to go.  Okay.  So Larry...  One has done the show probably four or five times.  Four or five times.  Maybe more, actually.  A few phone calls, too.  Um, hmm.  A few phone calls.  Uh, Bob Saget.  Bob Saget is not on the list, Jimmy.  Okay. 
[00:48:00]  Hmm.  Has done the show a few times, including phone calls.  One of these guys you were talking about this morning, Jimmy.  Maybe not on air, but while we were getting ready for the show.  Was I?  Yes.  What did I say when I came in?  Oh, let me think.  What the fuck?  See, I'm a good listener.  Was I talking...  Who was I talking about them with?  I don't remember anything I said when I came in.  Oh, that part I don't remember.  I was half asleep.  I'm very tired when I come in.  Three to go. 
[00:48:30]  Sleepy boy.  Shit.  One of the guys has done the show since moving over to SiriusXF.  I can't give you more hints.  No, no, no.  I know.  Uh, I'm done with hints.  Done the show.  Maybe I wasn't here that day, though.  I would say Robert Kelly, of course.  No, we already did one of the sort of regulars, Louis C.K.  Mm-hmm.  Although he hasn't been in in a while.  We gotta get him in here.  Yeah, sir.  Yes, sir.  Louis changed ever since his list came out.  Mm-hmm.  Louis Black.  No, he hasn't done the same with him as yours. 
[00:49:00]  No.  Fuck.  Three to go.  You want to give up?  No.  All right.  Can you have me a hint on the other ones?  I gave you a lot of hints.  One of the guys sat in this studio.  We've only been in this studio a month and a half.  Brian Riggins?  This studio.  This studio, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm thinking Brian.  I'm trying to think of comedians that have come in.  One guy you talked about this morning, a mere hour or so ago.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I don't think on the radio.  Hmm.  And the other guy, I can't say anything about the other guy without giving it away. 
[00:49:30]  That's a good hint right there.  Okay.  Well-  My hint would be very obvious.  Um, I talked about Imus, but that was on the air.  I don't know.  I give up.  Really?  Well-  Dang it.  Oh, yeah?  You don't know either?  No.  A comedian that was in this studio that's only done our show a handful of times.  That one you should get.  Not Russell Brand.  He wasn't on this side.  No.  And that would just be silly.  You like how I guess without guessing? 
[00:50:00]  We all do that.  Yeah, yeah.  With no commitment whatsoever to it.  If you would have said he's on the list, I would have said, well, yeah, no, I mean  Bustle, yeah.  Yeah.  Hoping the guy says, yes.  Oh, yeah, I know.  I was just saying.  Well, Colin Quinn should be on that list.  No.  Of course not.  Why would he be?  Doug Stanhope, number nine.  Okay.  Who was in this studio?  Pat Noswald.  Doug was in this studio?  Oh, right.  Okay.  Is that right?  He was right over there.  When Kevin Smith was there?  Never remember.  All right.  I'm Pat Noswald.  And who you were talking about this morning. 
[00:50:30]  And-  Ah, you're right.  I was.  Okay.  I think I like Patton, and I'd love to have him on.  And number three, Mitch Hedberg.  Okay.  Mitch definitely belongs on the list.  And that is your ten most influential stand-up comedians of the 2000s.  What is the-  According to thelaughtrack.com.  All right.  Well, some of them I agree with, but the fact that if you're going to talk about stand-up  comics-  Well, has Chris Rock done a lot of stand-up in the 2000s?  Sure has.  I mean-  Those two monster CDs of his were in the 90s.  Yeah, but he's hosted the Oscars in the 2000s. 
[00:51:00]  Um-  That's true, though, but, you know, stand-up.  Has he done any specials in the-  He did the last one, which was, uh, you know, it was all right.  He's done a lot of stuff in the 2000s, hasn't he?  Talk shows and fucking-  He's Chris-  He's, like, become this iconic figure.  Yeah, but, you know-  I think they're talking about pure stand-up.  Yeah.  And not other things these guys are doing.  Which doesn't make sense.  Then they wouldn't-  Well, Chappelle, yeah, Chappelle has been there.  Like, when you think of Dane Cook, stand-up.  Yep.  Right?  Mitch Hedberg, stand-up. 
[00:51:30]  This sounds like a Comedy Central-inspired list, though, just because they're at the  acts that they, uh-  All right.  All right, well.  Well, uh, Britain's Got Talent is over.  Thank God.  And I never really paid any attention except for-  Well, that's Susan Boyle.  That's Susan Boyle.  God, people talking about this thing, right?  Susan Burrell.  And this is how it went down.  The winner of Britain's Got Talent 2009 is-  Diversity!  Diversity! 
[00:52:00]  Diversity, I hear, is some kind of dance.  Dance troupe?  What?  Some dumb dance troupe won?  England's weird.  Maybe someone could, uh, call in that saw this show and tell us why this diversity won  over Susan Boyle.  They now have two big acts, though.  They have her.  Ew.  Everyone on the planet knows who these guys are.  This is what wins? 
[00:52:30]  They're just doing this really weird dance routine.  They got Sam's in it, apparently.  Boy, a big Afro guy.  Big Afro.  Why diversity?  It's just a bunch of dancers.  Yeah.  When you've seen one dance troupe, you've seen them all, no?  I know.  What makes this dance troupe great?  They throw their little kid around.  Oh, really?  They bring it.  They bring it on?  Uncle Paul.  Yeah, they-  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Somebody-  Ah, another kid coming down from the wire.  Ooh. 
[00:53:00]  Ew.  Break dancing.  I mean, they're not bad dancers, but-  But it's a dance troupe.  They shouldn't have beat fucking Ogre.  They shouldn't have beat Gene Stapleton.  How long would you sit through a dance troupe?  I'm-  I've already maxed out.  Yeah, I'm done.  To be honest, maybe if you were dragged to one of these things, you'd sit through one  number and go, oh, that was kind of cool.  And then look at your watch and go, fuck, an hour and 40 minutes of this to go?  Yeah, kind of done.  This is how Susan Boyle handled her runner-up position. 
[00:53:30]  Well, with every winner, there has to be a runner-up.  And this year, it is Susan Boyle.  What a fantastic competitor.  Susan, how do you feel right now?  The best people won.  That's very gracious of you.  You said to be there, you came runner-up to very deserved winners.  Do you feel that?  I really do.  They're very entertaining.  Lads, I wish you all the best.  Oh, that's very, very gracious.  Susan, can I just say, on behalf of us all here at Britain's Got Talent, it has been amazing 
[00:54:00]  to meet you.  Thank you so much for taking part.  We've all shared an incredible journey with you over the last seven weeks.  You've been phenomenal.  One more time, let's hear it for the runner-up, Susan Boyle!  And then she was rushed to the hospital over the weekend.  The stress got...  Dude, she was a fucking fat nobody from Scotland.  Yeah.  And now she is one of the most recognizable people on the planet.  World-renowned.  I hate her.  I'm sweating 20 years, and people don't even know me in fucking... 
[00:54:30]  Pass wrong concom, I'm a nobody.  It's amazing.  But that would drive anybody nuts.  You think?  Yeah.  Dude, that's...  She's like...  She just sang because she wanted to kind of sing, and all of a sudden, she is that famous.  Her second song sucked.  She put herself on the show.  The first song was amazing from what?  Les Miserables?  Les Miserables.  Les Miserables.  And then she did Memories, and she didn't nail it like the first song.  No.  Uh-oh.  This plane is nowhere to be seen. 
[00:55:00]  Maybe they stopped somewhere else for coffee.  It's a 330, 216 passengers, 12 crew.  12 crew members.  Oh, buh-bye.  Maybe they just did a little something-something.  Don't they have communications with the people?  What's the weather like?  Let's say hi to Gene in West Virginia.  Gene?  Oh, good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I just wanted to let you know that under the David Tell section in that article, they gave  a little mention to Jimmy Norton as part of the New York scene.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:55:30]  You should go back and read it.  They give a tip of the hat.  Read.  Mr. Jim Norton.  You got a little tip of the hat there, Jimmy.  I like hat tips.  A little tip of the hat to Jim Norton.  I try to eat in my career.  More hat tips.  Yeah.  I never get one.  Yeah, like the old lady with the walker type of hat tip I want to see you get.  Let's go to Brian in California.  Brian.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How are you?  Yeah, with the whole Eminem and Bruno thing, how about the fact that fucking Eminem was  mic'd up?  Eminem was mic'd up for the big stunt? 
[00:56:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  You do hear him.  I just assumed that was off Bruno's microphone.  But Bruno's mic was buried in Eminem's crotch.  Oh, I see.  Maybe they mic'd Bruno's ass knowing that it was going to land on somebody.  When he walked out, you could hear him cussing, though, and stuff.  You know, I think if it was like, I don't know, 1990, maybe people would buy into this  stuff more.  Did the cursing go out?  No.  Yeah, of course.  He's walking out with his bodyguards, his big old nigger bodyguards.  Jesus Christ.  What's the matter with you? 
[00:56:30]  Holy shit.  Well, all right.  Well, so the cursing didn't go out there.  They beeped it.  Yeah.  Was it recorded or something?  I don't even know anymore.  Hold on one second, sir.  Danny, where's my hat tip?  Is it a slam?  All right.  Oh, I thought you wanted Danny to tip his hat.  He's the only one wearing a hat.  Oh, I can tip it.  Look, look.  You just got a tip of the hat from Anthony.  Okay.  What does it say, Jimmy?  It's about Attell.  If the New York cringe humor genre is its own scene, then Dave Attell is probably its biggest 
[00:57:00]  star with a hat tip to Jim Norton.  Ah.  College kids from around the country beg to Attell, but to come to tape Insomniac from  2001 to 2004, you might have been one of them.  So if he's the biggest star with a hat tip to you, shouldn't you have been next person  on the list?  Well, if they're saying in the genre of cringe humor in New York, that's why I said this  was a good list.  Um, because guys like Chris Rock just haven't done anything in the 2000s.  How do I get a hat tip and Chris Rock doesn't get anything?  Hat tip.  Jesus, I should get nothing.  I should get a clit hood lift.  We're finding out more about diversity, I think. 
[00:57:30]  Let's say hi to Eric in New Jersey.  Eric?  Hi, boys.  Hey.  Hi, Eric.  Hi.  Hi, Jimmy Joe.  Thank you.  Yeah, that diversity dance crew, they all have a deformity.  I'm not sure what the name of it is, but they are amazing.  They're going to be at the Wellmont Theater on September 26th.  What date did you say?  Oh, you're right.  Wellmont Theater, re.com, myspace.com, slash Jim Norton.  Thank you very much.  It's funny.  Diversity and I are going to be, and Susan Boyle is going to come out and she does this 
[00:58:00]  thing where she tongues my ball bag and I smash her in the face.  It's a really funny routine we've been working on.  It's a hoot.  We play Hungry, Hungry Hippo.  I punch her in the back and her mouth opens and she grabs my balls and pulls them in.  That I got to see.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  I'm paying my ticket.  Hey, the Octomom.  Yeah, Octomom.  That's another big story as far as pop culture goes or whatever.  Here's another example of a despicable human being being rewarded for being a despicable 
[00:58:30]  human being.  Yeah, but I got a different angle on that.  All right.  She's signed to be a reality star.  Why wouldn't she?  But no one is picking up her show.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, and I don't understand that.  It's like, this is the perfect reality show.  Why is it perfect, though?  Because it's such a disaster.  If you're going to watch reality shows, you're going to want to watch the Octomom being a  horrendous mom and a lunatic. 
[00:59:00]  I hear she's...  Not this sort of stage reality that we're all heading toward.  I hear she's kind of crazy from everything in the news and her interviews.  Crazy.  Does that make a reality show?  Yes.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I mean, is she crazy all the time?  Or is it going to have to be written in craziness like they do with fucking shows that just  don't have enough shit going on in them? 
[00:59:30]  Just having the cameras rolling as the kids are just wandering around the house unsupervised?  I got to give it to like, you know, Ozzy and the Osbournes.  That show, it had crazy enough shit just based on its own to make it entertaining.  I look at commercials for...  I can't even...  I've never tuned in.  I never will.  But the commercials for fucking Gene Simmons Family Jewels.  I can't even look at the commercial without getting a douchey chill.  Why?  Because he's so fucking fake. 
[01:00:00]  The whole thing's phony.  Ugh.  It's just a fake reality show.  It's not real.  I want reality.  Yeah, believe me.  I'm not happy with Ozzy and his stupid commercials that he's doing every...  The commercials are lame, Jimmy.  They're bad, but I don't care.  They're bad.  Ozzy's getting some fucking dough.  Good for him.  He should be doing commercials.  Some dough.  Some dough rain meat.  That's right. 
[01:00:30]  Whatever Ozzy does...  Ozzy was the dark horse long enough.  He was the fucking...  You know what I mean?  He was the problem long enough.  The fact that he's doing a little commercial shit when he's almost 60.  I'll let him have fun.  Yeah.  Good for Oz.  He fucking bit the head off of two animals.  Caught shit from the Catholic Church.  He got kicked out of Texas for pissing on the Alamo.  Tried to choke his wife.  What do people want from this fucking guy?  He's done everything a rock star should do.  He's almost died 300 times.  Fucking does nothing but throw up on himself.  Forgets the words to his own songs.  Guys, he changes television by doing a reality show. 
[01:01:00]  And he makes a few bucks singing Take Me Out to the Ball Game and doing a few things.  Everybody wants to fucking kick him in his uncircumcised dick.  Leave Ozzy alone.  You have some valid points there, James.  The guy has been the fucking dark horse in music.  All he is...  Other rockers would look at him in awe at what a fuck-up he was.  So I'm all for it.  All right.  You win the argument.  Yeah.  But with the Octomom, though, I mean, we're starting to decide what reality shows should be on TV and what...  You want reality?  If you want reality, this is the type of show you'd want to check out. 
[01:01:30]  That's all I'm saying.  Top 10...  Well, there's top 20, but screw the top 20.  Top 10 album sellers of the 2000s.  We just did comedians.  Stand-up comedians.  Okay.  It's Top 10 Monday.  Nah.  I don't even know if we would get any of these.  Wow.  I don't think we'd get any of these.  No.  Let's try.  I can't even think of one.  U2. 
[01:02:00]  U2 is not on the top 10 list.  2U.  2U is not on the...  Metallica's 14.  We know Metallica.  Johnny Cash is 18.  Who the fuck is kicking Metallica's ass?  Kid Rock is 19.  I bet there's a lot of country.  Madonna.  You nailed it, Ant.  Yeah.  That's why we don't know this list.  A lot of country acts.  A lot of country acts.  Middle America.  I'll just run down it.  Top 10 album sellers of the 2000s. 
[01:02:30]  Number 10, Jay-Z.  Number 9 is Creed.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they do sell a lot of albums.  Eminem.  They only had two albums in the...  Wow.  They didn't have any albums, really, in the 2000s.  So those are just...  Old albums that they're selling?  Still selling like crazy for Creed.  8, Linkin Park.  7, Nelly.  And then here comes the country acts.  6, Kenny Chesney.  Kenny Chesney.  5, you got Britney Spears. 
[01:03:00]  4, Toby Keith.  3, Tim McGraw.  Number 2?  What a monster this band is.  Jesus Christ.  How are they still selling albums like this?  A little band named The Beatles.  Jesus Christ.  How are they number 2?  Half of them are dead.  Isn't that amazing?  They are selling some albums in the 2000s.  This is not of all time.  This is since...  Right.  I was ready to say 19, 2000.  19, 2000.  Since the year 2000. 
[01:03:30]  I'm fucking tired today, man.  Wow.  Got off the golf course as it was getting dark.  The Beatles have sold since the year 2000  27,591,000 albums.  You know, that's how Paul McCartney can still be rich  Paul McCartney guy.  That's why he didn't care about that Heather Mills.  Yeah, yeah.  He made up that money within a couple months.  Get it out of me life.  He doesn't care.  He just forks over the money. 
[01:04:00]  God, Jesus.  Number 2.  Number 2.  Their last album came out in what?  Fucking like 88?  What?  I just got really scared for you.  I didn't realize that.  Number 1.  You were joking.  Number 1.  Let me guess.  Is it...  Pop artist, not country, and a current pop artist.  Madonna.  Ooh, that's a...  I think that's a very good guess, Jimmy,  but she didn't even make the top 20, 
[01:04:30]  which is strange to me.  Pop artist?  Seems like she sold a lot of albums.  Gnarls Barkley?  Gnarls Barkley.  I guess it's not Eminem.  Eminem.  Is he number 1?  Yep.  Wow.  31,127,000 albums since the year 2000.  Well, yeah, that was his big years.  Wow.  31 million records.  I reckon that.  It's pretty amazing, huh?  Fucking...  Yeah, that's a lot of albums.  Beating out the Beatles. 
[01:05:00]  But the Beatles?  And Tim McCraw.  I was a fan of Tug myself.  That was his father.  Who's with me with the Tug thing?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Tug was his dad.  Tug was supposed to be the famous one in that family.  Oops.  Oops.  Yeah.  Let's take a break so we can do some...  I was reading oatmeal.  Oh, what happened to Ozzy's Variety Show?  Rob on Long Island wants to know.  Hey, yeah, what happened to that?  That show sucked.  Really?  I gave it a try. 
[01:05:30]  That thing was horrendous.  That thing will never come back.  They only aired the one thing?  And they sort of knew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think even Sharon, when she was promoting it, kind of knew.  It was like...  Yeah, she knew it sucked.  If you give it one week, if you give it one airing, that's not a good sign for the network.  You don't think, Jimmy?  No, probably not.  But I had pitched something I had wanted to do, actually.  I didn't pitch it to them.  But I told Roland I would love to have done something, like a video slideshow on the show,  of being an Ozzy fan and how every photo I have with him, he looks miserable. 
[01:06:00]  And just tell the story of how I've done nothing but annoy this guy for the last 15 years.  And I have a bunch of photos with him where he looks like he wants to just shit on me.  Ozzy never smiles in my pictures.  It hurts me.  And there's photos of him with other people in the same moment, smiling and happy, and  then he's got his arm around all fucking cancer tits.  What's no part of me.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  And we will continue.  Green Day did not make the list, Thomas Overbeck from Dallas. 
[01:06:30]  Green Day is selling a lot of albums since...  I almost did it again.  I would think, yeah.  Since the year 2000?  I would think they, you know, not the best albums, but...  Why isn't U2 in there?  Some of the big hits.  U2 had a couple of monster albums in the last few years.  Why isn't Madonna in there?  I'm not a Madonna fan, but it seems like she put out a bunch of things since 2000.  I guess it's a niche.  I'm trying to think of another band that maybe should have been on the list.  Those country artists really just fucking displaced everybody. 
[01:07:00]  That we're just not even close to being part of.  No, I was close.  Oh, was I close to knowing a lot of country music.  Really?  Really?  That's what I listened to for, you know, a summer.  You haven't listened to a country song since?  Fuck that.  Were you doing it just for the pussy?  Fuck that.  Right back to the wiggles.  Exactly.  The wiggles.  Oh, absolutely.  It's like going to a bad movie. 
[01:07:30]  You know, you just go for this.  Sometimes you do it for the pussy.  Get laid out of it or something.  But, yeah.  Ugh.  Music's terrible.  But then I started knowing the words to some of them.  I'm like, oh, Christ, man.  They're catchy.  Sure, some of them are.  I wouldn't download any of them.  And they are, like everybody says, they're all the same.  They really are.  Like every girl country artist that is singing a song is singing about her fucking cheating boyfriend and how he either broke her heart or she's getting back at him in some horrid way where, you know, she smashes up his pickup truck or, you know. 
[01:08:00]  We got to get Patrice in and do our country music bit.  I love that bit.  Oh, yeah.  We try to figure out what the song is about based on just the title.  And it's funny for everyone that listens to us that do live in that country world because they know these songs really well.  And they're listening to a bunch of dopes hearing the song for the first time trying to figure out what the song is about. 
[01:08:30]  Yep.  It's a really good bit.  We'll do that soon.  We'll try to figure that out.  Yeah, that's one of those that, look, look, she's smashing his truck up.  I love that song by Carrie Underwood.  You do?  It's a great tune, yeah.  Sure it is.  You don't like that?  No, I heard it 80,000 times.  It's good.  Did you guys?  Heard it, yeah.  And then, yeah.  I also had a couple of country songs left in my CD player.  Took his truck, took the computer, burned all of her stuff in the backyard. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, she should hand that stuff over to a country artist.  That would be a hit.  She was American Idol, right?  Yeah, she was, Jimmy.  But she didn't win.  She was just a small town girl.  No, she won.  I know.  Carrie Underwood won.  I'm a fool.  Ruben Stutter's my favorite.  Is he on that list?  Isn't he great?  He's a disaster.  He's a failure.  I know.  With all that exposure, he failed horribly.  He's making fucking hats out of bacon. 
[01:09:30]  They basically hand you this unbelievable career, and to fail that bad.  Yeah.  Wow.  Taylor Hicks, too, has the label dropped him.  Taylor Hicks is a failure.  Complete.  He had to do a little Broadway thing.  That's always embarrassing when it's like, for, you know, one month only.  I like Taylor Hicks.  I remember that season.  But it was all about Chris Daughtry that year.  Yeah.  I think it was the same year as Chris Daughtry, right?  One of you guys pointed it out.  I don't remember who it was.  Me! 
[01:10:00]  That's going to be my new thing.  That children have better tasting penises than adults.  I don't remember who it was at the point of that.  Do they?  Uncle Paul.  Wait, now I can't do my bit, because now you're going to flip it every time.  No, I won't.  I think it was actually you who pointed it out.  It was that the American Idol is so smart because the number two is the bigger fucking star.  A lot of times, like it was with Clay Aiken.  Yeah.  People go, oh, that should have been the winner.  But then they're like, no, because number two will make it on the merit of their talents,  and so they could cash in on that one. 
[01:10:30]  And number one will make it because they're number one, and they were the winner.  So they get two celebrities for the price of one.  I think they control all their careers now.  Oh, they do.  It used to be where they only control the winner, and then they started going, wait a minute.  We should be controlling all these guys.  Sign your life away off these two.  Jesus Christ.  I forgot about those two.  Is that from the first year?  Who are they?  That's, uh, I forgot her name.  Kelly Clarkson.  Oh, right. 
[01:11:00]  She still has a career, though, right?  You know why I forgot her name?  Because you forgot she used to be a good-looking broad.  Now she's a fat pig.  She got fat.  She looks like a real-life Cartman now.  Come on, they put out that really good movie, From Justin to Kelly.  You don't remember that one?  Oh, Justin.  What was his name?  Guarini, I think it's.  Wow.  Is that the guy right there?  I never got that.  Yeah, they were one and two that year.  The first year.  What's his name, that guy?  Justin something.  Justin Guarini.  But she still has a career, doesn't she?  Sort of.  She waddled onto a stage recently. 
[01:11:30]  Waddled on.  She waddled on.  You didn't see the picture?  Oh, yeah.  She's fucking horrific.  I haven't seen her.  Yeah.  Huge Jimmy.  I mean, you would swear that this isn't the same girl.  Maybe Danny can find that real fast.  Speaking of videos, there's something going on on the internet, the literal translation  of videos.  Has anyone checked this shit out yet?  Hmm.  One was sent to me over the weekend for, what was that?  Total Eclipse of the Heart. 
[01:12:00]  Horrendous song by Bonnie.  Bonnie Tyler.  I like that song.  Do you really?  Turn around, bright eyes.  She looks like Ozzy.  Yeah, look.  She looks like Ozzy.  That's the same girl that we just saw.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  No, she looks like the Ozzy from a Sabbath cover band.  Yeah, definitely.  Oh, God damn, could she do that?  And she's doing the double P sign, which basically means, I know I'm a fat, disgusting pig, and  you're all looking at me, but if I do this, maybe I'll distract your attention a little 
[01:12:30]  bit.  That's the same girl.  I'm having a big, fat, double chin.  Horrendous.  Right?  That's a shame.  You would probably bang Susan Boyle before you banged the latest Kelly Claw.  Slow down.  No, I wouldn't.  What?  What?  Oh, look at that ass.  Oh, and her leg.  She has those stupid, like, almost knocked knees.  Yeah.  You know when fucking fat girls have that thing where their thighs rubbed together and  their knees poke as awful?  And their knees are bent, like, the wrong way?  They go to the side?  Wow, that's fucked up.  Uh, Jared in Boston. 
[01:13:00]  Jerry.  Hey, guys, I got a theory on that Beatles thing.  Yeah.  Um, well, the new kids, the kids coming up, they're not buying CDs anymore.  It's probably all the old people replacing their vinyl.  Well, then, how do you explain Eminem, number one, my friend?  Eh.  Ah, your theory falls apart.  Good day.  Good day.  Thank you for nothing.  All right.  All right.  He's fracas.  I like how they got the sexy fan blowing her hair back.  Yeah.  Shot.  And meanwhile, uh, the bottom end of her is so fat, and she's a flatso, which is even 
[01:13:30]  worse.  Horrendous.  No tits and a big fucking gut and big, uh, ass.  She's a flatso.  Aw.  Can you, uh.  It's terrible.  I want to show these guys the literal, uh, if you go to YouTube.  It's Bonnie Tyler.  Just write, uh, literal, and it'll probably pop up.  Someone's saying the A-ha literal video one is really funny.  You want to do A-ha or Bonnie Tyler?  A-ha? 
[01:14:00]  A-ha is one that everyone's familiar with.  Want to do Take On Me?  Yeah.  What do they, uh, what do they do?  It's worth checking out on YouTube.  Some of them suck.  They do the literal, they sing along to the video that we all know.  The intro, wow.  That's really nice.  That'll make their money.  Dig reel.  Hey, want a taste of the dig reel?  What?  Well, here's my favorite video of the week. 
[01:14:30]  We usually just show a small clip, but I want to show the whole dang thing.  This is what a douche over him.  Because this was my favorite video as a kid.  Oh, I was going to explain the bit.  Good.  It just got better.  With over 2,800 digs, here's Take On Me, the literal version.  We all remember this.  Oh, college humor.  Reading a book.  Lady brings a new copy.  Peek in the window.  She would rather keep on reading.  Look at the frame. 
[01:15:00]  There's a handsome guy inside this comic.  Close up eyes.  Oh, I can't hold there.  That's kind of funny.  I'll get you on my mind.  It's definitely worth checking out on your own, obviously.  Oh, okay.  That's a great visual.  The bit is all they do is say exactly what's happening on the screen. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  80s, lots of squiggly lines.  When I stand here, it makes me human.  I'm handsome either way.  You know you like it that I'm flirting with you.  Come to me.  Come to me.  Magic friends.  Magic friends.  Sing to you.  Find my mom and son. 
[01:16:00]  That's a good one.  That's great.  That is funny, man.  What the?  Hey, stupid dining ditchers.  Makes me want to crumple something.  Oh, boy.  I'll show them.  Oh, yeah.  Marching right over my...  Right in the trash.  Whee!  Ah!  I told you to stay away from my magic frame.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Get out of here.  Come on, baby.  Bring at me, huh? 
[01:16:30]  What are they doing with our magic frame?  Come back here.  There you go.  Oh, no.  Where are we?  Where the hell am I?  What kind of hole is this?  Is this your house?  Is that them?  I'm going to get you.  Oh, what?  Dead end.  Come back here.  This guy's going to get an ass full of pipe wrenches.  Oh, watch out for them.  They're going to beat you up with the pipe wrenches.  Climb through this hole.  Show this guy, then cut back to these two.  Who comes through first? 
[01:17:00]  I'm going to kick the mouth with my old pipe wrenches.  What on earth had to hurt?  Take that hole.  Take that hole.  What happened to the game?  Stop the video.  Cut back to this guy.  Unbelievable, right?  What did happen at the end of that video?  Did the guy ever come through the comic book or no? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He fights his way out.  He fights his way out of the thing.  And then it looks like he was just kind of laying there all sweaty.  And he's there with her.  He kind of showed up like the Terminator does.  Just kind of naked with a hole through space.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Then he shot her in the head in a club.  There's a whole series of these videos.  That's funny.  Some of them are eh.  But every once in a while, they nail it.  The Bonnie Tyler Total Eclipse is pretty good.  That was a good one, though.  Not bad, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, check them out for yourself.  What do you like better, Total Eclipse of the Heart or Betty Davis Eyes? 
[01:18:00]  All kidding aside.  Do I have to answer?  Yes, which one do you like better?  That was so annoying.  I would have to go with Betty Davis Eyes.  Really?  I prefer Total Eclipse of the Heart.  It's a tough choice.  Don't get me wrong.  They're both pretty bad.  But you have to answer it.  Which one would you take?  Is Kim Karnes dead now?  I don't know.  She's dead!  Is she?  I think she is.  What?  If she isn't, I'm sure she'd be very anxious. 
[01:18:30]  Let's hope so.  She might as well be.  She's lonely.  Turn around.  Well, if you like this, you want to do the...  You've got to see it part of the literal version of the video.  I want to see part of the literal version.  I know it's not poking fun.  But the beauty is...  The lyrics are different.  You guys will be talking about this all day with your friends and family.  We just turned you on to the literal video thing.  Maybe not friends and family.  Well, exactly. 
[01:19:00]  Maybe just people.  There we go.  This is the literal...  This is the literal video version.  I've totally closed the door.  Thanks, man.  Pan the room.  Pan the room.  Random use of candles, empty bottles, and thought.  Then can you see me through the span?  Creepy dollar window and what looks like a bathrobe.  Then it's in the shot of dangling balls.  Close-up of some candles and dramatically posing. 
[01:19:30]  Then stock footage of a moon in the sky.  Messing up my close-up with a floating blue curtain.  Now let's see who's coming in from outside.  Double door is open.  Why are you not reacting in the shot?  Oh, no, no.  Guess I should be acting, but I'm not.  There's a job.  Wandered through a hall with doors that magically open.  And this classroom has a van.  Open shirt. 
[01:20:00]  Now it's getting creepy.  You can tell by my staring.  It's a long time since I've been with a man.  Stupid chair.  Emo kiddies throwing slow-moved love in my face.  I guess that means that he just slipped me the bird.  Spoke a room.  Staring at the swim team gets you killed by a gang of dancing ninja men who know how to twirl.  What a stupid video this one.  Terrible.  Then a bunch of preppies make a trophy.  It's a long time since I've been with a huge fan.  Rostovitch stands up on the floor. 
[01:20:30]  And they shouldn't fend tonight.  Or they're gonna hurt the gymnasts.  Why do they quit or fall inside?  Here's another shot of fencing.  And I'm all sleeping late from behind.  Watching shadows run off.  I walk onto a terrace where I think I'm alone.  But all the funserellis got an army of clothes. 
[01:21:00]  They do the marcarina but I'm still not impressed.  They make for me to dance with them but not in this dress.  I'm both like Rocky tonight.  I'm running up a bunch of stairs.  That's great.  Ripple of the ones that rise nearer.  If there I pretend to be Ava Peron.  Look at me, I'm lifting my arms.  There's nothing else to shoot.  So there's no camera under this arch. 
[01:21:30]  It's fucking really good.  What a great idea.  There's a bunch of these.  Leaning on myself because there's two of me here.  But now there's only one in the show.  I pulled my feathered hair whenever I say floating cloth.  Oh, oh, oh, I gotta use the bathroom but the door's locked.  Can you help me?  I'll open the door for you. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, thank you, sir.  How can I ever repay you?  Hey, this is an Apple 80s video album.  Hey, guys, check this out.  Whoa!  Wait, it's supposed to take the cloth and leave everything else on the table.  I don't know what happened.  It's not like that.  It's the other way.  No, stop.  You're making it worse.  All right.  Horrendous.  He's put gold dust in my fencing mask.  Hey, this isn't the ladies' room.  Life possessed quite a lot. 
[01:22:30]  Get out of my way, I gotta pee.  It's all because of my older boy.  Never mind, I just went on the floor.  Now I need to find a mom.  Look at me now.  He's located with too much makeup.  Now what's your bunch of passing it got?  Alice chest.  As we dance around in diapers, let that joyfully come on the damn.  That's the joke.  Look at the fog machine's on. 
[01:23:00]  What kind of private school was that in these kind of guys?  It started out as hard, but now it's Lord of the Fights.  I'm seated before.  I'm swaying side to side.  The dancers need to stop.  The gayest man I'll never call this over the top.  I whip my head to the right.  I'm never going to church again.  I think I want to do a tagline.  When it's sizing up, qualify as a dance. 
[01:23:30]  Kneeling like I want to throw up.  What the effing crap.  That angel guy just filled me up.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  You can fade out, man.  It goes on for a moment.  Although the effing crap, you could have either changed the line or said fucking.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't need effing.  Commit.  That's funny, though.  What a great idea.  Yeah.  Worth checking out on your own.  Obviously a visual bit.  I'm sorry.  It's just every frigging, literally every scene is just talked about as it happens. 
[01:24:00]  A bunch of people are saying Under the Bridge is really good.  The literal version of that video.  I'm going to check all these out.  And also try Tears for Fears.  Mullet with headlights.  Tears for Fears as well.  I checked out a Nirvana one.  It wasn't as good.  It smells like teen spirit.  It wasn't that great.  What's her name?  What?  Not Kim Carnes.  No, Bonnie Tyler.  Bonnie Tyler. 
[01:24:30]  What year was that?  Like 82?  Jeez, probably.  Might be a little later.  You forget how the 80 videos were, though.  Like, Gervais captured it when he did the Office Christmas special.  It's like just running through the hole with the flimsy cloth.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the things that make no sense at all.  Just walking around this apartment and a dove is flying by.  Why is it in your house?  Juxtaposition on records.  The 90s videos weren't much better.  That's true.  Let's push sludge through pipes. 
[01:25:00]  They were all the same with that blurry, blurry edge.  And old people staring into the camera for too long of a time, not moving.  Blurry.  David Brent.  That's great.  He fucking...  It's great with his bad shirt.  It's my favorite wine.  Cabernet Sauvignon.  Sauvignon.  I really know you.  But I've been lying awake at night wondering if you really know me.  Because...  He's wearing white.  It's a completely overly lit white room. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, overexposed.  And he's got the dramatic look up.  It's fucking great.  Yeah, the way his eyes fall on the camera and he's trying to be all sexy, but he's just...  He's wearing a white, like, too loose-fitting cloth outfit with an open top.  What an ass.  That we've been through.  He's throwing a dove.  He's throwing a dove like he is.  Like I understand me.  Video.  Like I understand you.  The hair fucking teased on his forehead.  Now, girl, I know the difference. 
[01:26:00]  Stroking her picture.  It's awful.  Every awful 80s video.  It really is.  Every 80s video cliche.  Nothing to break up our happy home.  The light.  The lighting.  He's singing and arguing with her, like, in character.  I came home a little late at night.  And he's barefoot.  Because we only act like children.  Oh.  When we argue for some firewood. 
[01:26:30]  The crossfade, like...  They don't know me.  Now he's singing in the same room as himself.  Sitting on the couch, all depressed.  It's fucking...  It's not overly done.  It's perfect.  That's exactly how they made the videos in the 80s.  No.  Unbelievable.  Just a position records.  That is a good...  Just a position records.  What a terribly douchey name.  I've never seen that.  I've got to check out that.  You never saw The Christmas?  You never saw The Christmas?  I'm a huge fan of the British office.  It's fucking...  You think, like, are they going to jump the shark? 
[01:27:00]  Right.  It's so fucking good.  I don't have that.  I've got to find that.  I'll give it to you.  I have it.  All right.  I'll loan it to you.  Let me rephrase that.  Oh, it's a good one.  Just give it to me.  All right.  You can buy another one.  Send Kenny out.  I'll buy it for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll sign it to you, too.  Oh, sweet.  I would like that.  That would be very nice.  That he's barefoot.  Kills me, too.  And it's the reveal.  It's like, he's like, well, we argue, fucking five.  But he's, like, singing it to her.  Yeah, of course he is.  Oh.  Because you're arguing songs.  She walks off.  It's great.  People are saying we have to see the Rick Rolled. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, no.  Really?  I don't know.  Never going to give you up.  This is very visual.  I know.  It's a third song in a row.  It was either this or a lot of commercials, so.  We're going to get to the commercials anyway.  That's true.  At some point.  One less commercial break, I'm thinking, because we went real long here.  I have to tinkle badly, but I can.  You want to just see, like, 30 seconds of Rick Rolled?  30 seconds, and that's it.  We can't just keep doing that.  Then how about Danny just turns off the video after 30 seconds?  That's it.  Because I know how we are.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, we're just going to be staring at another video. 
[01:28:00]  30 seconds.  While we're supposed to be doing a radio show.  30 seconds after the vocal comes in.  All right.  I'm assuming it's this.  I don't know.  I haven't seen this one.  This is Rick Rolled, the literal version.  Ding.  All right, look.  Dance, all right.  Ten my feet.  Move my hands.  Spin around.  Gyrate.  Gyrate.  Look that way.  Uh-huh.  Dance.  Uh-huh.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  Dance in some sort of alley.  Hey, dance backwards.  All right, now I'm in some sort of prison yard.  Okay, that's right.  Look at this backwards. 
[01:28:30]  We're going to get to the spine of all the skin.  In my creepy trench coat.  Blue denim shirt and hipster shades.  Enough of me, let's cut to my shadow.  And then I'll dance under this nondescript tunnel.  Oh, I can't see a blind girl dancing freely.  Gotta take this too big with Hall.  Carry over all alone.  Rex and I'm just like the front phone. 
[01:29:00]  Giant windows make this place look churchy.  No one here to serve.  Let's call.  Finally, menage a swat.  Suspenders don't suit him at all.  30 seconds.  Yeah.  I don't like that one.  If it was the first one we saw, maybe we would like it.  The guy doesn't sing very well.  Yeah.  It's kind of better when the voice is better.  You've got to find someone that can nail the vocals.  Yeah.  Like the one, it sounds like Bonnie Tyler is singing that one.  Yeah.  Right?  We'll take a break. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  That one, not so good.  Let's go make it out.  Glad we made a 30 second one.  You guys don't know comedy because right here in the comments for that Rickroll video,  it specifically says OMGROFLMAO with at least seven exclamation points.  Oh, shit.  Then we're fucking stupid.  I'm groffled.  That doesn't mean anything.  Oh, Jim.  A literal Jim.  You should have a B with a bunch of O's.  But instead, I give you this, my friend.  Thank you.  Thank you, all dear friends.  For coming to my birthday. 
[01:30:00]  Birthday.  It's not birthday.  I realize why I love the way he says that.  It's not birthday.  It's birthday.  My birthday.  I got a new one that I love that we got to find.  Something about he has a horrendous laugh and then says something like,  it's so good to laugh.  I don't know if that's the exact one, but we have to start playing that one a lot, too.  Somebody over the weekend put the six or seven clips of Pee Wee from the 30 Rock episode together nicely on a website. 
[01:30:30]  Funny.  Oh, you might have it, Dan.  Yeah, just give me one sec.  Yeah, I sent it out on Twitter over the weekend.  Let me see.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do the...  Click four?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The end of this one I want for my machine. 
[01:31:00]  Dan, why isn't it playing?  What?  Danny.  What the fuck?  Oh, there it is.  Volume up.  If you will please direct your attention to the center of the room, it is now time for the kick.  You're 25?  Yes.  Can you believe it?  Finally old enough to rent a car.  Oh, it feels good to laugh. 
[01:31:30]  His little arm is shaking.  He's like directing that singer with his little hand.  Go on.  Could you play the first part again?  That's terrible.  That horrendous laugh is the best. 
[01:32:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you will please direct your attention to the center of the room, it is now time for the kick.  You're 25?  Yes.  Can you believe it?  Finally old enough to rent a car.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, it feels good to laugh.  I need that for my machine. 
[01:32:30]  Ah!  Or if somebody bombs, oh, it feels good to laugh.  That's a great clip.  Yeah.  There's six of them.  I'll retweet it to all my followers on Twitter.  I already did it.  I'm way ahead of you.  Let's take a quick break and we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  Remake of an 80s song.  Careless Whisper. 
[01:33:00]  Bye.  I was the one who brought this to the show.  I forgot the band.  Help me.  They deserve...  Ah!  Ah!  See you there.  What?  See you there.  Oh, yeah.  See you there.  Opie and Anthony.  Up is number one at the box office.  Is it?  Up?  What is that?  Did you say Up is number one?  At the box office.  Is that the cartoon?  I don't know what Up is. 
[01:33:30]  Let me look at his eyes.  I swear to God.  I am...  Is it the animation?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's the animated film there, Jimmy.  Oh.  Old man and puts a lot of balloons on his house and goes for a little ride.  Bless you.  Pixar, you know.  Pixar.  You know, a little film by Pixar, their latest creation.  A little film by a company called Pixar.  No idea.  Yeah.  Number one at the box office. 
[01:34:00]  68 million.  Night at the museum.  Another 25 million.  Great movie title.  I don't even know if this movie's good, but...  Drag Me to Hell.  Drag Me to Hell.  Sounds like a WWE pay-per-view, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And tune in to Drag Me to Hell this weekend.  I'll see you at Drag Me to Hell.  It's one of those things.  The only reason I'm doing the list is so I can say, Drag Me to Hell. 
[01:34:30]  It sounds like more of a match than a whole pay-per-view.  Like, you know, it's the Undertaker and Kane in a Drag Me to Hell match.  Drag Me to Hell match.  The loser actually goes to hell.  Terminator.  Salvation.  Yeah.  Sounds like two wrestlers that should be wrestling in the Drag Me to Hell match.  Terminator and Salvation.  Going at it.  And then Star Trek.  Yeah.  Still up there, huh?  12.8.  Fifth place.  That'll be it for Star Trek, though. 
[01:35:00]  It goes bye-bye.  You know what I watched last night?  That Fox movie channel's pretty good.  They play some of the old movies.  And they got some old guy that comes on, some producer from Fox.  He tells a little story about the movie and stuff.  And you know what else they do that I like?  They play it in abso-fucking-loot widescreen.  So even on your 16.9 television, it's still letterboxed a little bit.  And I watched Planet of the Apes, the original one, I think for the first time ever in that aspect ratio, 
[01:35:30]  where you see the whole scene.  It's so much better than a square-looking, like, 4-by-3 crappy.  Our ancestors were stupid with that square TV idea.  Horrible.  What the hell were they thinking?  It just looked like shit.  And then when I watched it on the Fox movie channel there, it's a real ultra-wide.  And those shots of, like, where they're going through the Forbidden Zone and stuff at the beginning, 
[01:36:00]  really cool, man.  You got to see all that scenery that was just cut out when they put it on TV.  You know what?  I got to check that out.  Very cool.  You just turned me on to something.  It's like, because I've seen Planet of the Apes a thousand fucking times, but to see it like that.  And as I was turning it on, I'm like, you know, I've seen this movie a thousand times, but I'm going to watch it.  Yeah, it was a 2.35.  You ever do the commentary on Planet of the Apes?  I think it's commentary or it was just a special where they talked about the whole series. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw that one.  And how they kind of ran out of money and then they started pointing out how horrendous the extras looked in the bad monkey masks.  Like, the first one, they did it right.  Everyone, the makeup was just over the top, just amazing.  And then the budget was kind of cut or something, so they just put a Halloween mask on a bunch of the monkeys in the crowd scenes.  Yeah, it was horrible looking.  You could see them, if you freeze frame it, you could see them in the background with these awful looking masks on.  There were a few other things they pointed out and how horrendous it was as the series went on.  But to see a movie like that and the widescreen the way it's supposed to be, it's amazing the difference than when you just watch it squish down what you're missing. 
[01:37:00]  Like, that whole peripheral thing is so important to a fucking movie, especially when you've got a good director and a good cinematographer, director of photography,  that knows what they're doing and sets up a shot so you're supposed to see what's going on in the middle,  but that peripheral thing is important to the shot.  And they just, some fucking asshole at some TV station goes, chop, chop, thwock, eh, fuck it, thwock. 
[01:37:30]  And just throws it in a garbage pile.  It's embarrassing.  Or pan and scan stinks too.  Pan and scan rots.  And rots.  Rots.  Dude, I haven't heard that in fucking years.  It's appropriate for the circumstance.  It rots.  And then what they do that pisses me off is a lot of times the credits have to be in widescreen or they're smashed together.  That's why when you watch the old movies from the 70s, like, you'd know the movie was ending because everybody got real tall and skinny. 
[01:38:00]  And they put the credits on.  Because they had to squeeze the credits.  Because they had to squeeze the credits on the screen.  And, um, like, when they do that in widescreen, and I'm watching the credits going, oh, shit, you know, it's a good, I want to see this in widescreen.  The second it says directed by, and then that ends, there it is, the whole fucking movie back to regular, uh, uh...  Can't they cut down the credits, too?  We're done with credits.  They've done a good job at doing that.  Because most people will sit and go, oh, that's who that was. 
[01:38:30]  And then you're like, all right, whatever.  And you get up, and the credits roll for another 15 minutes.  Yeah.  Like, they should, they should sit down and decide which credits are really important to this film.  These are the ones we're going to put up on the screen in the movie theaters.  It's a legal thing.  Is it really a legal thing?  Yeah, they have to run it.  But what they did on Fox Movie Channel...  Do you need to give the, uh, a credit to the secretary of the film?  The grip, the assistant to, the, yeah.  Who cares about those people?  I'm sure we're talking to a few of those people.  I'm sorry, but... 
[01:39:00]  Sorry, your name didn't flash up for three seconds.  Not even a third of a second.  And they, uh...  A lot of times now on Fox Movie Channel, they squeeze it to the bottom of the picture.  And then they go with the guy doing commentary about Planet of the Apes.  Or about, like, Die...  Die Hard's another one.  I've seen it a thousand times on TV and everything like that.  And again, it was a nice wide aspect.  And it just, like, looked so much cooler that way.  Hey, uh, back to, uh...  Beneath the Planet of the Apes and Back 2 is on FXM today. 
[01:39:30]  Nice.  Not big fans of any of the other Planet of the Apes.  Oh, come on.  Don't be fresh.  Beneath, not bad at first.  And then it gets too weird with the mutants and the friggin...  Yeah, but they got the bomb, man.  The praying to the bomb.  The almighty bomb.  Heston makes a cameo for three seconds.  You know, that's what they're doing in North Korea.  Who are you kidding?  Praying to the bomb.  Praying to the bomb.  You know, I mentioned golf.  Uh, if someone could find this article.  Uh, Kim Jong... 
[01:40:00]  Kim Jong-il.  You know, he's the great...  You know that he's the greatest golfer in the world?  Is he?  I can't believe his countrymen are buying into his horse shit.  Supposedly, his first round of golf...  Someone's got to find this.  He shot a 34 under.  Of course.  With 11...  11 hole-in-ones.  And they report this as news in North Korea.  Get the fuck out of here.  I read it over the weekend.  I think it was in yesterday's paper.  If someone could find this.  That's amazing, though.  Just because he's a fucking dictator doesn't mean he can't play golf. 
[01:40:30]  What a kook.  Funny.  Can we find all the other things that he has claimed to do?  Because there's a whole list of them.  But I didn't read the...  I never read the golf one before.  Here it is.  Move over, Tiger.  His first time out.  North Korea's Kim shot 38 under par his first time out.  First time out.  So he just said, let me give this game a try.  Danny, can you read that?  I can't read that from you or...  They believe anything.  The first paragraph or something.  I bet you they don't.  They probably know he's a complete sociopath asshole.  But if they criticize him, you know.  Yeah, they'll be killed.  Or the worst thing, imagine if he did. 
[01:41:00]  He went out and shot 38 under.  Yeah.  He's like, I know I'm a little nutty, but...  No one buries me!  I'm trying to find where it is here.  Glasses.  It's glasses.  And his shoes.  Well, it's an article from WorldTribune.com, so...  Wow.  It's got to be true.  Of course it does.  And Kent the movie guy is saying that Drag Me to Hell is a good movie.  It's a Sam...  What's that Sam?  Sam Raimi. 
[01:41:30]  Sam Raimi.  Sam Raimi.  It's kind of like Evil Dead, very scary, and very, very funny.  Yeah.  They do that little mix of comedy.  A lot of scenes are done on purpose to look like hack horror movie scenes.  Like the slow turn.  That's it with the ominous music.  And it takes like an hour for the girl to turn around.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Then they're not...  I don't know if they're marking that movie right.  I thought it was just a...  No, it's scary, too. 
[01:42:00]  Oh.  I'm frightened.  I'm frightened.  Frightened.  It's very frightening.  Was this miniature golf, or is this a real golf game?  It says here that Pyongyang Media says Kim enjoys golf, having shot multiple...  That's not how you pronounce that name, Danny.  How long have you been working for the show?  Come on.  I'm sorry.  Break that in!  Media says Kim enjoys golf, having shot multiple holes in one during his first try at the game.  He reportedly aced five holes and finished 38 under par on the golf course. 
[01:42:30]  What a load of shit.  He routinely shoots three or four holes in one per round, the government-controlled media reported.  Routinely!  The government-controlled media reported.  Routinely!  Routinely!  You'll be lucky in your entire lifetime to get one.  Yeah.  And this motherfucker.  And every once in a while, you'll read about somebody that had two in one round.  Yeah.  But that is like...  It's a miracle.  That's like once every 20 years or something.  Routinely!  Routinely!  Three or four per round. 
[01:43:00]  What a fucking asshole.  That's fucking great.  Just fantastic.  Or we even acknowledge they're a country.  Yeah.  How is that a country with a leader like that?  How is it a country?  Just astounding.  I don't know.  Let me say hi to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Go!  Morning, boys.  Hey!  Hey!  The list of what Kim Jong-il has done is similar to the list of what Chuck Norris has done.  Kim Jong-il doesn't do a push-up.  He pushes the planet down. 
[01:43:30]  Right.  The old Chuck Norris gag.  Only it's news in that stupid country.  Yeah.  We've got to find a list of other things this guy does.  He's amazing.  He really is.  He's divine is what it is.  He can do things because he's actually holy.  He's a holy in one.  Boo, boo, boo, boo.  That's kind of cute.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes, North Korea's average course length is 100 yards.  See, because they're all short.  Waka waka. 
[01:44:00]  Nice picture of him.  It's an oldie.  It's one that's hanging up in all the schools that they've got to pray to.  Bruce tickets were on sale today.  Are you going to go see Bruce Springsteen today?  No!  Or get your tickets?  All I picture is Roland.  Now, anytime I think of Bruce and the tickets, I'm with a pain in the ass, and that they're  bogus tickets, they're trying to sell them for too much money, the dealers are getting  them.  And I just think of poor Roland trying to get his tickets.  He'll get his tickets. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, every show.  I was lucky enough to see Bruce Springsteen only once, and that was when he did his experimental  Ghost of Tom Joad thing.  Oh, you didn't even get like the...  I don't think I got one hit.  You didn't get Bond in the USA?  I didn't get one hit.  It was just Bruce.  It was just Bruce.  Wow, that is really bad.  My old friend Buzzy dragged me along.  I was so fucking bored.  Yeah.  Acoustic Bruce not playing any hits.  There is not much Bruce.  Where it was Nebraska, I don't even know. 
[01:45:00]  He did that Nebraska album, right?  Oh, right, yeah.  So maybe it was around...  I don't even know what I saw.  You saw shit is what you saw.  Yes.  You saw shit.  It was acoustic with no hits.  That's what I remember.  It's like, boy, lucky me.  I can't tell you how boring it is to sit in a concert that you really are not enjoying.  It takes forever.  And if you're with somebody that's like digging it, it's like, oh, I'm just looking at the  bangles there.  You mean when I...  Oh, my God. 
[01:45:30]  They've aged a little bit.  What?  Wow.  The one in the middle is a guy now.  And that's...  What's her name?  That was the hot one.  Did they get rid of one of them?  Is that actually here at Sirius?  Susan...  Susan Hoff.  That might be here, actually.  Hoff.  Susan Hoff.  Really?  Why are they...  They played here.  Why are they showing...  Belinda Carlyle.  Belinda Carlyle to show how they can get big?  And what...  Oh, Jesus.  Where did the old guitarist go?  Wasn't there another guitarist?  I don't know. 
[01:46:00]  How would you know that?  Because I remember the videos.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, they're at Sirius.  Sirius.  Are they here right now?  No, they were here at the end last week.  Really?  Oh, so great.  A week old.  A few days old.  Huh.  I like this song.  What, the bangles are getting back together?  Is that what this is all about?  Holy shit.  Look at that beast.  They look like old moms.  They look like everyone's mom.  Susanna Hoff looks pretty hot still.  Yeah.  Susanna Hoff looks good.  How old is she?  She's got to be in her early 40s now. 
[01:46:30]  No, mid-40s probably, right?  No, not that old.  She was a kid.  80s, let's say.  30, 40.  Well, you know what?  She's not hot anymore.  She's cute.  She kind of looks.  She doesn't have that chubby little baby fat.  Her face grew.  No, she's got like sharper features.  That's what I mean.  Her face grew out.  She needed some of that baby fat on there.  Ugh.  Oh, look at the anchor guy.  He's like, oh, I'm not commenting.  I've seen a word.  Just jerk off that band. 
[01:47:00]  Well.  God, it's just.  Well, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Mark from Soul writes.  He's listening to us from South Korea.  He writes, Kim hires a staff to inspect his rice to make sure each piece is the same size.  No fucking way.  But who knows with this guy?  He's got.  I need a list of other things this guy does.  He's nuts.  Rice all the same size or he freaks out.  No, come on.  I have no idea.  How OCD is that?  Should be Kim Jong-kenny.  His official biography also claims Kim has composed six operas and enjoys staging elaborate musicals. 
[01:47:30]  Kim also refers to himself as an internet expert.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Danny is an internet expert.  He can find pornography at the drop of a hat.  It's amazing.  I wonder if Kim Jong-il can do the same.  Kim, find me docking immediately.  Boom.  There it is.  Let's say hi to Cock Sock. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, Cock Sock.  The Cock Sock.  It's been a while.  What's up, Cock Sock?  Hello, bo-bo-bo-boys.  Hello, Mr. Sock.  Yeah, I just was stationed up there right on the border between north and south.  And everything North Korea does is about, like, cock size.  Like, their flag is freaking huge.  If you guys look up on the internet joint security area, you'll be able to look at a bunch of different things that North Korea does to be, like, badass or whatever.  So it's a one-up South Korea, basically. 
[01:48:30]  Really?  So it's got to be big.  Our flag is bigger, so it's better.  Little Nicky has arrived for us.  Oh, hi, little Nicky.  It's little Nicky.  How are you?  All right.  There you go.  All right, boy.  All right, boy.  Why is that so funny?  I love the little Nicky bit.  Little Nicky just walks down the long hall.  It's so awkward for him, too.  He's now just waves.  Because now he just gives a P sign.  He's way in on the joke.  And he's like, oh, how many more steps before this hallway ends?  Turns out he's one of the fans here at SiriusXM that listens to the show. 
[01:49:00]  So he's in on the bit.  And Danny's got to bring the picture up.  Come on.  And it makes me laugh every time.  All right.  We're going nowhere with the North Korea bit, obviously.  Maybe we'll get back to that.  But first, we got some breaking news.  Backstage with O&A.  Oh.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[01:49:30]  And Steve C., the developmentally disabled executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show,  showed up to work wearing effeminate capri shorts.  We went to Steve to get the scoop.  Steve, what are you wearing?  Shorts, Sam.  No, those are capri shorts.  Are they really?  I thought they were just shorts.  No, they go too far past the knees and they're tight.  They're effeminate capri shorts.  Oh, and they're fringed at the bottom.  They're fancy.  Do you ever, like, look at yourself in the mirror and think, how can I make the guys make  fun of me today? 
[01:50:00]  Um, no.  I actually look in the mirror and go, I have no idea if this has any fashion relevancy  whatsoever.  Then I turn around and I look at my...  I have to stop this.  We never stop the backstage with O&A bit.  We let it play through.  Yeah.  Steve is always thinking fashion.  And failing miserably every time.  Oh, hell yeah.  He doesn't fucking put on capri pants thinking they're just shorts.  Is he wearing them today?  Yes!  Call him in here immediately.  I have to see his legs.  All right, here he comes. 
[01:50:30]  Oh my God.  Hold on.  We'll get...  Let me get the rest of this backstage with O&A.  He's wearing Marianne's pants from, uh...  That's exactly what those are.  And he has a skipper's body.  Before we get him in, let's get the rest of this backstage.  But he's lying through his teeth.  I wouldn't see whatsoever.  Then I turn around and I look at my 15 fiancee and I go, who fucking cares what they think?  Right, I could just wear her clothes.  No, not quite.  She actually bought them for me, so...  She says they're trendy.  I have to believe her.  Yes, they're a huge trend in the gay culture right now.  Are you making that up? 
[01:51:00]  No.  Fair enough.  As Steve sees Mask of Heterosexuality slowly slipped away, we went to O&A staff members  E-Rock, Mars, Travis, and Danny to get their take on Steve's pants.  What's that, Eric?  I just saw these.  You just saw what?  These awful shorts.  They're great shorts.  Do you think those are jeans that a straight masculine man would wear?  I don't think most gay people would wear those either.  Hey, Mars, did you see what Steve was wearing today?  Uh, I noticed yes.  What did you think? 
[01:51:30]  Well, at first, I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I thought it was long shorts until he sat up.  And I saw these fuzzy knickers.  Knickers.  Yeah, I think they call them knickers.  Knickers.  Travis, did you see Steve's pants today?  I tried.  Yes, I did see them.  What did you think?  I thought they were quite gay.  Danny, did you see what Steve was wearing today?  Yeah.  Do you think Steve purposely wears things that people think are gay?  Dude, just leave the guy alone, man.  They're sexy.  They're fashionable. 
[01:52:00]  They're coming back this year.  I think they look good.  That's weird.  I suppose everyone's entitled to their opinions, but if Steve's pants aren't gay, they're certainly  heavily bi-curious.  It seems the only thing Steve does worse than producing a radio show is convincing people  he's attracted to women.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  Hey.  Wow.  Oh, damn.  Steve's right outside the door.  Damn.  Here comes Steve.  Now, I didn't notice these before. 
[01:52:30]  Okay.  Steve.  Yeah.  Steve.  You were lying.  What?  You're always thinking about fashion.  I'm always thinking about vanity.  I'm like, I don't know if vanity and fashion are...  You put those on thinking they were long shorts, and you have no clue what a capri pants  is?  I don't know what capri pants are.  Come on, Steve.  I really don't.  I'm just fixing the back one.  Come on.  Thank you, sweetie.  Everyone knows what a capri pants is.  I really...  I know what long shorts are, and I've got a handful of pairs.  So you think those are long shorts?  Yeah.  They're not?  No.  No.  Not even close.  I'll fully admit I'm a vain, egocentric prick, but...  Let me tell you what long shorts are. 
[01:53:00]  Long shorts are shorts that are long, yet the leg doesn't taper.  They're very baggy and long.  Okay.  Like, over the weekend, I was wearing long shorts.  Okay, so technically, if these were long shorts, they should end at the knee?  No, no.  They should be big.  Big, big around.  They are so much thinner at the end of them than they are at, like, mid-thigh.  Okay?  They should just go down.  If they go down all one side...  Those...  If you watch Gilligan's Island... 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Marianne is wearing those exact same pants.  This is not helping.  No.  These are designer, like, long shorts.  No!  I don't think there's a guy out there that can pull off the capri pants.  No.  Honestly, they couldn't be gayer if they came with cum splattered on the back.  Jimmy, you don't like them?  Would you wear those?  No!  I wouldn't.  Steve's pants look like something that Sacha Baron Cohen would wear as Bruno. 
[01:54:00]  Like, that's what he would wear.  But then that's trendy.  Right?  And very gay.  I think Evan's got the long shorts on today.  Which, you know...  What's Evan?  Does he?  Okay, so they'd have to go...  Kind of like that Abercrombie and Fitch.  Kind of baggy.  They stay big.  Let's see.  Okay, so they go just below the knee.  Yes.  Those are, like...  Those are considered, like, sort of long shorts.  They've got, like, cargo pockets on them.  They don't get all tight around the knee area.  Exactly.  Those are guy pants. 
[01:54:30]  Yours are very tight everywhere.  Like, very tight.  And even around the bottom where they're caprid.  Hoffman from Virginia.  You couldn't find caprid...  You couldn't find those pants in the men's section, could you?  No, I couldn't.  But I did find them in the women's.  Yeah!  There they are.  And it's the brand that he's wearing, too.  Holy shit!  Women wear caprid pants.  Then why would they make them in this size, though?  A lot of women...  Why are you sweating so profusely?  I sweat all the time. 
[01:55:00]  You're sweating like crazy.  I always sweat, though.  No.  Women are wearing caprid pants like crazy right now.  Guys, not so much.  No.  A lot of gay guys are.  For real?  Yeah, there's a big thing in that with very...  But it's a very gay look.  Like, it's a very effeminate, like...  I work in the fashion industry.  I'm the gayest guy you've ever seen.  It's a bottom look.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Thank you, Sam.  Very gay.  All right, I'm on the men's shorts.  All right.  And there's nothing that looks like those.  The closest thing is right there, but that comes up to the knees. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  So it's about two inches below the knee.  But in all fairness...  No, it's not.  But in all fairness to Steve, they're not making capri pants that big for women.  Yeah.  They're really not.  They would be fucking huge.  Wow.  So I don't know if this is funny.  I have a feeling it might be.  It says...  And if you are wearing those jeans, you're wearing $216 shorts.  Wow.  My chick bought them for me, so...  Jay from Huntington.  Does anyone else picture Steve getting dressed to goodbye horses? 
[01:56:00]  Why is that funny?  It's from Silence of the Lambs.  Oh, I'm crying over you.  Oh, right, right.  Okay.  I knew there was a reason why that would be funny.  You like these capris?  Would you fuck me?  Neither would I.  I fuck me hard.  Steve's shorts are made by Victoria's Secret FFS.  They're true religion?  Yeah.  True religions.  Not many guys can pull off the true religion thing.  Voss wears true religion jeans. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Bobby Kelly wears them, too, doesn't he?  Yeah, the beacon of masculinity, Bobby Kelly.  E-Rock's got something.  And Voss was a weight problem.  Fucking person.  And Bobby's sexy point.  E-Rock's going to the mic.  I thought Steve might want to just complete the outfit.  What is that?  A Lane Bryant shirt?  Yeah.  Nice animal pattern Lane Bryant shirt from his glory days.  I think Steve's...  Would you wear that?  I have worn it.  Give me the thing.  How are you going to put it on? 
[01:57:00]  Good.  Glitter on it.  That's right.  Prove them wrong, Steve.  Put on this shirt.  Oh, please.  I'm already...  Now tuck your penis between your legs.  I'm already in the hole.  Look at the pockets.  They're like little sweet buttons.  They're trendy.  Mm-hmm.  He's got a little...  Steve, you don't have to wear everything your girl buys you.  Sometimes you've got to say, I can't wear this.  Yeah, my girl buys me stuff.  I'm like, what are you, insane?  I can't fucking wear this.  My girl brought me rubbers.  I won't wear them.  Hold on.  Sometimes you have to say, you know, nice thought, but I'm returning this.  Women don't buy things. 
[01:57:30]  It's an old hack point, but...  Oh, boy.  Wow, this is...  This is 3X, by the way.  It's a 3X.  It's so...  Okay.  Fucking hot.  I'm kind of...  Everyone...  Get your cameras.  Everyone noticed your cover, by the way.  My girl bought them.  She did.  But that doesn't mean you go on and wear it to work the next day.  The hole in his story is that he's like, oh, I don't know.  I don't know what they are.  I don't know what they are.  But he knew that they were designer jeans and they were supposed to be...  Oh, I know now because Sam's been doing this for about a half an hour.  So I call my... 
[01:58:00]  And by the way...  The hole in his story is in the back of these pants.  Danny is exactly right because the second I started making fun of him, he said, Sam,  these are designer jeans.  These are trendy jeans.  These jeans are worth more than your life.  That's why I stopped the backstage with O&A because he made it sound like, I don't know.  I don't pay attention to fashion.  No, he knew.  He knew very well.  He's very proud of his fashion sense.  Let me say hi to Dan in Philly.  Hello, Dan.  Hello, Dan.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Check the flap over the zipper. 
[01:58:30]  I believe, if my information is correct, that the flap is reversed for women's pants  as opposed to men's pants.  No, no, no.  Like, look at the front.  What do you mean?  Like...  No, it's flapped over the same way.  No, that's nice.  Oh, my God.  They're tight around your crotch.  They are.  They're really tight around your crotch, huh?  I'm back.  I'm fully back at the gym after a two-month absence and fucking eating, like, horribly.  Don't they call them clam diggers or whatever?  Are they? 
[01:59:00]  I don't know.  Clam diggers.  Yeah.  We got two clams in the sand getting ready for the picking.  Steve, if those are men's jeans, can you please find them on the website?  I just look for them.  Come on.  Find them.  Let's say hi to Bob in New York.  Bob?  Yeah, how you doing?  I was wondering...  Dude, you know what?  The guy wants to dress like that.  You know what, dude?  It's really easy to dress however you want to...  But I'm going to say girl pants?  Yeah, but...  Yes, Bob.  What are you doing?  It was the men's pants. 
[01:59:30]  What size are they?  What size?  They're waist size 42 right now.  Oh, okay.  They're...  Yeah, but is there a number on the back?  Yeah, is there just a number?  Like 20.  Like those chick sizes.  I don't even know what they mean.  I wear an eight.  I think they're men's capri pants, but...  I don't know.  Still, guys aren't wearing capri pants.  Yeah.  There's a huge...  This is a pretty hip place, this SiriusXM. 
[02:00:00]  Is anyone walking around with capris?  No, I'm telling you, like, capris are a look that is 100% effeminate.  Like, guys who wear capris are trying to pull off a very effeminate gay look.  It's not a cool thing for guys to wear capris and try to come off as masculine.  Yeah, it's really not.  It's, uh...  But look at my calves.  Yeah, you have big calves, but they're not long shorts.  They're capris.  What the hell is that, E-Rock?  Yeah, E-Rock is obsessed with Steve's breakfast.  Oh, no.  He eats it every day.  With everybody else's, too. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, hold on.  With the whole concept of...  We'll get another Nicky sighting, though, Nicky.  I must...  What is it, E-Rock?  Wait a minute, he's coming back.  Why is Nicky coming back?  What is it?  My neck.  He made the face.  Is that my chicken with cheese?  No.  What are you eating for breakfast, Steve?  Leftover buffalo wings.  Oh, thank God you're not eating like shit anymore.  Oh, yeah.  Steve, what are you doing?  You had surgery, Steve.  Why don't you go have some egg whites?  What are you doing?  Oh, I had egg whites.  Hold on.  Sam just brought up a great point.  Didn't you just a mere ten minutes ago say that you stopped eating like shit and you hit 
[02:01:00]  the gym again?  I did hit the gym.  After eating like shit for two months?  What was the quote?  You just said it.  I did start eating in the gym and I have been eating like shit and I continue to eat like  shit.  Why eat like shit?  Why should you stop?  You know what, dude?  The truth, I'm an addict and I don't drink.  I don't do drugs.  I don't smoke.  Why can't you be a salad addict?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because salad sucks, at least right now.  You're right, though.  Salad sucks.  I'm done with salads, too.  I fucking hate them.  I eat because I'm unhappy.  I fucking punch salads now.  I'm unhappy because I eat. 
[02:01:30]  Give me a salad's like a punch it.  I fucking hate salads.  Steve's right.  I'm with him on that.  He's soaking wet.  I sweat.  What the fuck are you on that?  You're sweating so much.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  We all have hoots.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  I did have two monsters already.  I did have two monsters already.  I have a communique from Steve's girl.  Oh, okay.  The lovely.  True religion brand jeans dot com.  Try under men's shorts. 
[02:02:00]  I did.  That's what we've been trying to look at.  That exact thing.  We're on the website.  I believe they're men's shorts, but the problem is I don't really see guys wearing the capris.  That's all.  But if you want to wear the capris, who am I?  Steve, if these are the ones that you're wearing.  I dress like shit everywhere.  My legs are too short.  You don't pull it off.  You don't pull it off.  You should just be shorter and wear them as long pants.  Chop my calves out.  They probably made them that big as a goof and put them in the store.  Let's see if anyone buys these. 
[02:02:30]  The back's different.  It's not the same.  It's not as big.  It's not the cup.  Fringe is not in, by the way.  Fringe is so far from being in right now.  Fringe is so 1974.  But those have fringes on them.  The ones he's looking at right there.  Yeah, those are not.  Fringe is not in.  You got the fringes, too, on them?  Yeah.  The ones that look like he took a cheese grater to the cup.  Jeansize.com to check size.  That's what Jeff's saying.  J-E-E-N size.com.  Right, Jeff?  Like hillbilly jeans you're wearing.  Like the hillbillies would wear those barefoot. 
[02:03:00]  Sam, drag me down there and they'd eat possum.  He looked like the Hulk in regular pants.  The Hulk is cool, though.  Yes.  Are we friends with Al Q yet?  Where are we at with them?  Actually, I think Mars made some headway with the host because...  Ha ha, you said headway.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  I think we have somewhat of a working relationship with them now.  Can we drag Steve over there and get their opinion?  Can we bring one of them in here so they're on our show?  Can we tell we have an opinion on men's pants? 
[02:03:30]  Ask Larry.  He's pretty cool.  Oh, you know Larry.  Yeah, I met these guys a few weeks ago.  Go shopping.  Oh, where?  Go shopping.  Can we bring one of those out here?  Yeah, we'll ask him.  They might be doing their own show.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  The Hulk pants.  Yeah, that's what Steve looks like.  Where are the Hulk pants?  The Hulk's too big.  Don't make me angry.  You wouldn't like me when I'm angry or when I'm not.  Oh, shit. 
[02:04:00]  Wait, let's say hi to Footer.  Footer!  Yes, gentlemen, listen to me.  You're getting it all wrong.  I'm a European traveler.  I do European traveling on the side.  Later, boys.  I guess they're popular in Europe, Steve.  Do you know that?  I had no idea about that.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, how are you, buddy?  Hey, yesterday I was in Russell, Illinois.  I'm a truck driver.  Yeah.  And I seen this truck driver.  He had to weigh 400 pounds.  He had 50 style black glasses on.  He was maybe 40.  And he was wearing khaki capris with flip-flops. 
[02:04:30]  All right, who's wearing that?  Ashton?  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Yeah, but Steve's not in Hollywood.  But he's Ashton Kutcher.  Right.  I would imagine Hollywood guys are wearing them.  Gay guys, according to Sam.  European guys, according to that other dude.  And that's it.  And maybe a couple band guys.  It's good.  The capris are good.  When you fuck the chicken.  Brooklyn Ace. 
[02:05:00]  Salad sucks and so do I.  Salad sucks and so do I.  They're killing you, Steve.  I know.  Let's go to Stryker.  It's my turn.  Stryker.  Good evening.  Hello.  You know, the part that makes us even gayer is that Sam knows way too much about gay clothing  styles and the gay lifestyle for somebody who claims to be so straight.  Sam, comment.  Sam.  Stryker's all over your shit saying,  and you know way too much about the gay lifestyle.  Define yourself.  Well, part of my job is to keep in touch with the cultures that Opie and Anthony might not 
[02:05:30]  keep in touch with.  That way, this is a well-informed radio show.  So the only thing I'm guilty of is doing my job well.  Yeah, but you've also kissed a bunch of guys.  Yeah, but that was also for the show.  Oh, God.  That's the greatest gay picture ever.  Is that the greatest gay picture ever?  Come on.  There's a fat-ass guy wearing Daisy Dukes up his ass crack.  Like, half the bottom of his ass is hanging out.  Chavez said, this is what's next for Steve.  I said, what?  What? 
[02:06:00]  It's totally normal.  I would never wear that.  It's so 2002.  It's a great one.  That is...  I gotta tweet that shit.  That's great over here.  Wow.  And he's a big bear.  He's got, like, the big beard.  You know, the one on his face, not the one on his arm.  I think Pride is at the end of the month.  That would be a place where we'd see some Capri shorts on gentlemen.  Oh, the gay Pride?  Yes. 
[02:06:30]  Which you'll be going to?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Some interviews?  I'll probably wear normal man pants, though.  No, I just want to make sure you're good.  I got some good audio out of the whole thing.  We got Bruce in Pennsylvania wants to defend Steve.  Bruce?  Hey, guys, I want to defend Steve, because, you know, I spent, like, nine months in Egypt  last year.  And the Italian sailors that we were stationed with, they wore Capris all the time.  They also carried men's purse and kissed each other on the fucking lips.  Steve is dressed like an Italian sailor. 
[02:07:00]  Yes, he is.  Ooh, sailor.  All right.  Let's say hi to Clutch in Baltimore.  Clutch.  Hey, I want to know if he looks like Little Abner from a cartoon.  Oh, yeah.  Little Abner.  No.  That was like a comic strip from...  Oh, he behaves like Little Abner Louie.  Fuck you now, boy.  All right.  Holy shit. 
[02:07:30]  So drag him over to Al Q.  Once they're on break, we'll get...  Is there someone in here?  Or we can get one of the guys in here.  Yeah, I mean, they're doing their show now, but...  Just go in and yell at them.  When they're done.  Yeah, once they're done.  Knock on their door while they're live.  With Steve.  Because there's a lot of shit going on at this place.  They don't like Sam a whole lot, so...  They started hating me because...  Why, why?  ...because I blocked them from going to their live show to ask them who they were.  Yeah, they don't like Sam a whole lot.  Ever since that day?  Yeah.  They really don't.  They really don't.  They don't like being interrupted. 
[02:08:00]  What?  Their show.  Their show.  Why don't we wait until they're on break?  Get someone who they like more.  Mars.  They love Mars.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Let's get Mars in here.  That's where men are from.  I'm getting...  I'm getting words...  I'm getting word from Travis that we heard from Liam, who's the guest booker here, and  he's saying that Al-Q has already mentioned Steve's capris on their show today.  No way.  Whoa.  Have they really?  For real?  That's what I'm hearing. 
[02:08:30]  Steve is the gayest.  Wow, Steve.  They said that it is not hot.  Oh!  I told you they're not in fashion.  Mars, get in here.  Mars.  Mars.  Mars, you're making friends with the Al-Q guys.  Yes, Mr. Larry Flick.  Larry Flick's all right?  He's a friend of mine.  Flick.  Flick.  Yeah?  How's he a friend of yours?  I'm sure they didn't rhyme that in a school.  Oh, shit.  Wick likes dick. 
[02:09:00]  So, Larry Flick is on the show?  Yes, he is.  How do you know Larry?  He came through the shop, and someone introduced me to him.  Oh, no.  What shop?  The engineering shop.  There's an engineering shop around this room.  I thought it was a gay club.  Yeah.  The shop.  Going down the shop.  Bunch of men with no shirts and shorts and wrenches.  The shop.  So, can we get one of those guys in here on the break just to talk about Steve's pants?  We could try, but the last time I spoke to him, they were annoyed with us a little bit.  Why?  Because we had some thugs in the corridor stopping him from going to his show. 
[02:09:30]  That thug would be Sam.  Sam, he weighs 110 pounds.  Sam, how much do you weigh, Sam?  How much do you weigh, Sam, for real?  I weigh 135 pounds.  He's a twink.  No, you don't.  All right, 130 pounds.  You're a twink.  He did use that word, thug.  What is a twink?  Let's say hi to Craig.  Craig.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, this is, I guess in Providence Town, there's this thing called Bear Week.  It would be perfect for Steve. 
[02:10:00]  I guess it's all the...  Yeah.  We did a whole break on the gay cruise, the gay bear cruise.  Because they had all sorts of events.  Remember all those crazy events they had?  Oh, God.  Look at the bears.  Oh, no.  The Provincetown bears.  Guys.  Oh, look at these guys.  Look at Steve.  Yeah.  Look at Steve.  Look at Steve.  This guy's just bears.  Big beards and hairy chests. 
[02:10:30]  Jesus.  Oh, God.  So happy to be touching each other.  Did these guys fuck each other all weekend?  Oh, my God.  What's your man-on-man kissing?  Yes.  Wow.  Oh, Steve.  Well, come on.  Why are you fucking lemon party?  What's wrong with you guys?  Just three old guys helping each other out.  No, he's young because he got lost on the way to that guy's house. 
[02:11:00]  There's supposed to be four of us.  Did we ever figure out who the gayest guy is in this picture?  Steve.  The answer is always Steve.  I don't know.  It's definitely...  Lemon party rules.  The guy laying back getting his dick sucked and kissing is pretty gay because...  The guy sucking the dick is probably the gayest.  But somebody said that kissing another guy is gayer than blowing another guy.  Maybe.  Well, not...  The guy laying on his back, if he wasn't kissing the other guy, he probably would be  the less of the dudes as far as the gay thing goes. 
[02:11:30]  The one guy who's kissing the guy on the back and then he's holding his chest gingerly.  Could be the gayest guy.  He might be, yeah.  Because the guy's sucking dick.  He's like, yeah, whatever.  We've all made mistakes.  We've all made mistakes.  How do you decide which one is the gayest guy in that picture?  We've tried to distinguish this before and it's got to be the kissing, hand-on-chest guy.  I think it might have been Louis C.K., I think.  But I think he had a brilliant answer for this one.  I'm trying to remember.  It was the guy taking the picture. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  That was what he said.  No, I think that question was who would you rather be in this picture if you had to be one.  Yeah, that was it.  If you had to be someone, who would you be?  And it was the guy taking the picture.  But I'm thinking the guy taking the picture got right back into the action.  Into the scene.  He's like, oh, I've got to take a picture of this.  But then he jumped back in.  I bet you it was one of them who took it.  It was probably on an auto-timer.  I'll bet you it was the guy sucking the dick.  Like, the other two were just kissing and he ran and set the auto-timer.  And then just jumped down and popped that hog in his mouth. 
[02:12:30]  And it went, cha-ching.  Hold on.  I have it set.  That comes over.  Well, actually, he said it wrong.  It was set for two hours ago when they were all wearing clothes and smiling.  They didn't plan on getting caught blowing each other.  John Hall from Boston.  The SiriusXM engineer shop.  A bunch of guys.  No shirts.  Flip-flops.  Sexy capris.  And making docking sleeves because they all got their foreskin clipped.  Aw. 
[02:13:00]  Alright, well.  I don't know, Steve.  Yeah, we can't figure it out.  I'm trying to help you figure it out.  No, I know.  The capri look is a little rough.  They're long shorts.  And just because your girl buys it doesn't mean you have to wear it.  Well, I know that.  I always feel bad, but I go, look, I can't.  No, I can't wear this.  I got shit on hangers in my closet that I will never take off the hanger.  And it's, you know, old clothes that my chick bought me years ago.  Yeah.  Don't let him get away with the my girl bought me thing because he's over there defending  them, talking about how fashionable they are and how expensive they are. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, he likes them.  It's not anything to do with his girl buying them.  Maybe I'll just cut two inches off the knee thing and then they'll be...  No, because then that fringe that they put on for you will be ruined.  Do gay people buy shirts?  Because every picture of gay people, of, you know, gay people, they're just shirtless with  their arms around each other.  Is he brushing that guy's nipple with his arm around him?  Yeah, kind of.  I think he's brushing both gentlemen's nipples. 
[02:14:00]  What a time.  What a time they're all having.  Why don't we take a break and regroup?  I'm glad we have a UFC ex-champion coming in in a few minutes and listening to this.  Yeah, isn't that great?  Is he here?  Forrest Griffin, yes.  I'm glad he's, I'm happy he's walking into this fucking...  We're going to talk to Forrest.  I forgot he was coming on today.  Fuck.  Forrest Griffin.  In studio, nine o'clock, so probably after the break.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:14:30]  I guess Steve and Sam walked over to OutQ.  I think they wanted Steve in his capri pants on OutQ this morning.  Who wouldn't?  We'll have the audio in a few minutes.  Not sure when that's going down, but it's going down.  Get it?  Going down.  That's some kind of a joke, I think.  Thank you.  Thank you, old, dear friends. 
[02:15:00]  For coming to my birthday!  How about the NBA playoffs, Dan, huh?  What are you thinking?  Holy Jesus.  What are you thinking?  Well, you know something?  LeBron in a little bit of trouble there, I see.  He got knocked out.  So he's not in trouble anymore.  See?  See?  That's the trouble.  The Cavs will not be in the NBA Finals. 
[02:15:30]  The NBA is pissed.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  Magic beat them.  Magic Johnson?  Magic.  The guy with the AIDS?  Oh!  The guy with the AIDS that is huge?  Oh!  Yeah, it's going to be the Lakers and the Magic there.  All right!  That's what everyone wanted to see, right?  Yeah!  Not so much.  No, huh?  Stanley Cup Finals.  What are you thinking?  All right!  LeBron!  I'm thinking penguins take it. 
[02:16:00]  Oof!  They're down to zip.  What?  To the Red Wings and their octopus.  Oh, yeah, the octopi.  When did the octopi thing start in Detroit?  I don't know.  A while ago.  I remember that stuff from years ago.  Yeah, but who started it?  I don't really know.  And now they have to throw the dumb octopus on the ice.  Travis, you know the octopus thing?  No.  Fruit.  Jesus Christ.  I hope this guy doesn't kill us.  Ladies and gentlemen, Forrest Griffin.  What's up, man?  What's up, Forrest?  How are you, brother? 
[02:16:30]  I'm well.  Where are you?  Doing good.  We'll put you over there.  Let him get situated.  Good.  Good.  You look like you could be a problem.  How does it be a problem in general?  Doesn't mean a problem.  Look at him.  He's a scary fucking dude, man.  I'm not, though, right?  I look kind of normal looking, right?  You got those eyes.  Do I?  It's the eyes.  Yeah, you got those eyes.  I'm not going to fuck with you.  I know.  Can we get some headphones?  What the hell are those?  Can we get these baby headphones? 
[02:17:00]  Nothing's going to fit on these ears.  Do I really need the headphones?  Are we taking calls or something?  We took calls.  We might.  We just talked to you.  We got a lot of...  You can tell me what people say.  We got a lot of Forrest Griffin fans that might want to talk to you, Forrest.  I've talked to listening to people anyway.  That's a pretty good road to take.  Much happier life.  You don't like listening to people?  Who does, right?  This is...  I'm serious, right?  Yeah, you could curse yourself.  Fuck yeah.  Most of them are assholes, first of all, people.  What about your fans?  You don't like talking to them? 
[02:17:30]  I mean, I do if they're genuinely fans.  I mean, most people are fans of the sport.  Right.  And they've got, you know, they've got usually good, very helpful advice from me, which would  be, like when I gave KCK and the NASCAR driver advice about how to drive.  Very pertinent.  Yeah.  Because I know a lot about fucking NASCAR.  I should give this guy advice.  So what is something a fan has said to you?  Drive.  Drive fast.  What has a fan said to you, like fighting-wise or whatever, that just made you want to smack  him, but you were kind of polite about?  Man, there's so many things. 
[02:18:00]  I don't even know where to get started.  You know?  People come up with like ludicrous things.  Like, you know, you should really make a better entrance.  I don't like your entrance.  Your entrance?  What?  My entrance?  What's that got to do with anything?  That's asinine.  Shut up.  But people tell you, like, you know, the worst, though, seriously, is when, like, a 30-year-old  chick at Starbucks is like, yeah, you know, you should really keep your hands up and try  to move to your left more, like away from their power.  And I'm like, bitch, you're dead on. 
[02:18:30]  How do you know this?  What are you talking about?  You should have taken her advice and fucking punched her in the face.  I was like, what?  And then stepped to the left and I was like, bitch, I'm going to move out of your power.  Get told.  The only fight I've ever been to was you and Rampage.  That was the only actual UFC event.  Well, then you've done it.  It was great.  What else is there?  Great fucking fight.  It was an amazing fight.  Yeah, he took the belt on Rampage.  I saw the TV, you know.  What's this button do?  Is that really, it's got like a safety mechanism?  I didn't even know this morning.  I said, what is that?  What is that, Danny? 
[02:19:00]  Do we know?  Well, you know how our show here.  We're directly connected to ComSac.  It's kind of in D.C.  Basically, that button runs right to D.C.  And if we press it, we go to commercial break.  What?  It's a backup for the one that Travis has.  Is that if a guest is panicking, he could just...  You know what?  They did it so that these studios could be used independently of one another.  Oh, good.  Goody, goody gumdrop.  It needs all that protection.  The force is right.  Why can't we just have a button?  Because that's the button runs.  It looks like it's fucking...  That's like the president's football.  Yeah, it looks like it's going to set up some fucking missiles or something. 
[02:19:30]  Listen, I beat the shit out of you.  Yeah.  Don't say this.  I beat the shit out of you.  With whom?  UFC.  The game.  Well, I mean, what character beat me up?  My own guy, Chopmeat.  Oh, you?  Yeah, he's Chopmeat.  I built up a character named Chopmeat, and he's been kicking ass.  My character is Forrest Glassjaw Griffin.  And I've got to be honest, he's not doing so well.  Turns out Forrest sucks at video games. 
[02:20:00]  Are you really playing the game?  Yeah, I'm horrible.  You know, they gave me, like, the game and stuff, and they're like,  yeah, here's how you play it.  And I was like, oh, here's how retards play it.  It's a great game, man.  It's a lot of fun.  I'm sure retards can play the game.  Dana Whitehall cannot.  Dana White was in here showing off the game, and we all are just,  well, more than most, are hooked on this thing.  I love it, man.  It's hysterical.  It's a great video game.  It's like kicking people in the side of the head and the body.  You see, here's the deal, man.  I tuned out on games when they had, like, two buttons, right? 
[02:20:30]  Really?  Pong?  It was this and this.  Like, you know, the basic Mario Brothers, you know?  Yeah.  Side-scrolling.  I haven't been playing 14 years, you know?  Turns out I played sports.  I got laid.  I didn't fucking play video games.  I had a life.  Stop pushing that on us.  I understand.  Taking other people's girlfriends and punching the guys in the face.  You know what, though?  He's right.  Too many buttons.  I'm with him.  I don't know how to figure out the combinations and shit.  No, no, no.  No, no.  Head kick.  You've got to hold the top button and then press that. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Press that three times and then hit your force.  Kind of gets a little crazy.  I play the golf games because those are kind of easy.  But these fighting games, they're nice.  It's more complicated than giving a chicken orgasm.  I've got to touch rare and do what at the same time?  Fuck that.  I'm not into playing a game you can do in real life.  Like golf.  You could just go out and play fucking golf.  I can't go around and start blasting people on the streets.  And what's the move called when you just push all buttons and hope something happens?  Ass blaster.  No, I don't know.  What is it called?  Ass blaster. 
[02:21:30]  It's button mashing.  That's where your character just shits in the ring and the other fuck just slips in it.  Oh, bam.  Goes down.  Twisted ankle over time.  I have to.  I have to.  I'm one of those guys that have to stay up, though.  How do you lose a plane?  Well, we're in trouble for us.  There's a plane missing?  Air France.  They're starting to say that it might have been hit by lightning, right?  Yeah.  Oh, that's horrible.  We lost this one.  This is not going to end good.  Who knows?  It might have been an antenna.  Maybe they just lost the antenna.  Wow.  Yeah, but it wouldn't be off radar then.  It's like you wouldn't.  What's it?  Transponder?  Transponder.  Yeah, but you wouldn't lose that and your communications. 
[02:22:00]  They lost everything.  Yeah.  For the people just tuning in, Air France, where?  Over the ocean?  Brazil to Paris, yeah.  Brazil to Paris?  Coast to Brazil.  Louis C.K. is being arrested.  Looks like Woody Allen.  It does.  It's a little of both.  A lot of news happening.  I know.  We just kind of.  That's the Twilight Zone.  Planes are disappearing?  What the heck?  Yeah, that was a Twilight Zone.  220 people aboard, something like that?  Yikes.  You know where they are, though.  They're on the Lost Island right now.  Ah.  Are you a fan of Lost?  I am, actually.  Yeah, that was a good one.  8-15, baby. 
[02:22:30]  I was kind of pissed when it ended.  Now I don't know what to do with Wednesday nights.  I should get out and get laid, I guess, and not play video games.  Don't.  Yeah, just play.  Just more time on the video games.  I don't know.  I'm very addicted to that stupid fucking show.  The way they ended season five really disturbed me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was like a fucking housewife.  Don't know what to do.  Fanned myself.  Like, oh, now what?  How long do I have to wait?  Oh, 10 months?  This is great.  I don't have to wait, because I just got the box set.  I'm starting from the first episode.  That's what I do.  I'm way behind.  Stop bragging.  I just wait until the whole thing's over, and it's on DVD, and kill it in like a week. 
[02:23:00]  Watch the whole thing, do a marathon.  That's what I did with The Wire.  We were just discussing The Wire.  Yeah, I did the same thing with The Wire.  The guys at Spike TV were like, you have to watch this.  And I was like, why?  They were like, well, this is what suburban white people think about urban black people.  It's a great portrayal of, like, a bunch of white people talking about the ghettoes.  Yeah.  Do you know what?  Sounds very pertinent.  Right?  What you just said is a guarantee why they never got an Emmy.  It's one of the best shows ever.  And I guarantee it was that attitude people thought, well, this is how white people feel 
[02:23:30]  about black people.  That was such a fucking realistic show.  There's no one from Baltimore that wouldn't tell you that's realistic.  No, no.  Yeah, no, that's true.  That's the way the drug trade is.  Eat more, baby.  And people fucking, they're like, they never got nominated for an Emmy.  And that's why.  Because people were like, oh, that's white people's view of black people.  That was the way I've heard it is from my white friends.  Like I said, people want to people, white people write the black people talk, obviously.  Yeah.  People want to talk to you just like we thought there, Forrest.  We got Forrest Griffin in studio.  Tim, what's up? 
[02:24:00]  You don't have to put them on.  Just put them on New Year's.  Whatever you want to do.  Turn your radio down, dummy.  Hey, Tim, talk.  You're on the air with Forrest.  Right away, I know he's a fan.  Look, I can't figure out a radio.  Turn your fucking radio.  I had to hang up.  You had to.  He wasn't doing nothing.  Look, if you call the show, we're on a slight delay.  So if you hear someone go, hello, Tim, you're on the air, that means you have to talk now.  Don't talk to your radio.  We're talking about the book God Fight? 
[02:24:30]  What can you tell us about your book?  We haven't been, but I guess we aren't now.  There's something very funny, by the way, and again, the inside cover, they have like  a little synopsis of what the book's about.  That's me trying to goad you into buying the book.  It worked.  I mean, it's phenomenal.  It's also says, Forrest is, why should you buy this book instead of one by a lot of much  higher caliber fighters?  Forrest is not as good looking as those guys.  He's not as smart as them, and he's not as athletically endowed.  And let's face it, neither are you.  And right now, he's blowing his nose really loud, which kind of reminds me of it, and 
[02:25:00]  said, but you can actually aspire to be like Forrest one day.  Why?  Because he is nothing special, just like you.  It's kind of self-deprecating, which I like.  And not just me.  I'm deprecating everyone.  I'm deprecating all over the place.  So what is it?  Like, you say you're not a martial artist.  You're a fighter.  Like, what's the difference?  Uh, I don't wear pajamas and do katas or something.  I'm not a fat middle-aged man that tells 12-year-old kids what to do. 
[02:25:30]  I don't, uh, I don't like kids.  God damn.  That's fantastic.  I don't practice breathing.  I don't have a giant stomach and tell kids how to do it.  You go in there and try to beat the shit out of somebody.  I never did karate or anything.  Maybe that's why I'm a cheetah's champ.  He fucking did karate.  What a jerk.  You just...  I played football, man.  I wasn't a loser.  But now, as far as fighting goes, you didn't...  Did you train as a boxer?  Was there anything?  Or did you just know how to... 
[02:26:00]  I mean, I still don't know how to fight.  Originally, you just know how to fucking punch people real hard?  No, no.  You see, here's the thing, man.  And it's actually in the book.  I really was overly aggressive in athletics.  Not mean, but like, I'm an idiot.  And I'm kind of a klutz.  So I just ran into people playing basketball, playing football, playing whatever we happened  to be playing.  I always went like...  I tried to win.  The only way I knew how to win was hustle.  And apparently, hustling and head-butting people are not mutually exclusive.  You do that a lot.  So I just run into people, and they beat the shit out of me. 
[02:26:30]  So I started fighting.  I was trying to play basketball, but a little too rough, so I got beat up a lot.  So I ended up fighting.  Because you had to.  Other people were beating you up, so obviously you got it.  Well, I was a kid that was going to elbow you in the head.  Oh, we got this rebound.  Oh!  It was like, we're playing on a concrete court, and you're hard fouling people.  What the hell are you doing, Forrest?  You're an idiot.  So when did you realize, like, wow, I'm getting pretty good at beating people up.  I should go pro.  I don't know, man.  I was in the college at UGA, and I saw these guys beating each other up in this room. 
[02:27:00]  And I was like, man, I should do that.  That looks cool.  I could do that.  Like, who looked at that?  I look at that and go, I don't want to be near that room.  It looks like it hurts.  I needed something to do, and I was like, man, I bet I could do that.  You never watched the UFC and thought, oh, I could do that.  No.  No.  Anytime I see somebody actually laying there bleeding, I go, I could do that.  That I could do.  Not get up.  I saw the guy laying down unconscious, shaking. 
[02:27:30]  I was like, worst case scenario, I can't be worse than that guy.  Okay, there, man.  I could do better than that.  But, like, no, I look at things like that.  Like, fighting looks like it hurts.  And the few I've been in, they do hurt.  Yeah.  Like, I don't like that punch to the head when everything goes, bing.  Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham.  And then you're just going, boy, if this guy knew, he could touch me.  People are talking to you, and he's like, it's Charlie Brown's teacher.  You don't know what's going on.  Wham, wham, wham, wham.  It's like, one more punch and I'm out. 
[02:28:00]  You know, my, you know, you ever run skydiving?  No.  All right, you stand on the plane.  I've been skydiving a couple times.  You're standing on the plane.  You're strapped to some dude.  Lucky me, I got strapped to the dude that didn't talk and joke around.  Everybody else, you know, you have to jump tandem first time anyway.  Everybody else joking.  I got the guy that looks like he's depressed today.  Maybe he's going to kill himself and take me with him.  You know, maybe he's fucking going to fake an accident and, like, get some life insurance off me. 
[02:28:30]  I'm like, oh, fuck this guy.  And, you know, they open the plane and you're thinking, what have I done?  How did I do this?  And the only reason why I was able to do it is because there's, like, 40-year-old housewives that are doing it for, like, their 40th birthday.  They really were on this little plane.  And they're just calm, cool, and laughing, like, oh, this is so fun.  And I was like, dude, I want to go first.  Let's go first.  Come on, let's just get it over with.  Yeah, I'm going to die.  Let's just jump off the plane now.  I don't want to have to wait to die.  This is the worst part.  So you totally just wrote yourself off. 
[02:29:00]  So I jump.  I do that every fight.  Once you hit the air, though, it's really freeing.  It's like, you know, he talks about in Fight Club.  You're like, ah, you're free from everything.  You know, your problems.  Did you get your girlfriend pregnant?  You know, can you pay your mortgage?  You don't think about any of that.  You're free.  And you're plummeting.  Just for that, you know, 13 seconds.  Do they train you to not just fucking flail your feet and like try to gain ground, which  is instinctive?  Or do they tell you just put your arms out straight and fall?  All right.  They say arch.  And then they explain this arching process to you. 
[02:29:30]  And apparently I was the best archer in the world because my back hurt for like four  days afterwards.  I arched so hard.  Basically, you tell me to do something about a life's in jeopardy.  I'm going to do it.  I'm like, arch!  But is your instinct to just kind of kick and, because that would be my instinct, just  to kind of kick and flail and just try to grab something.  Would you be a pain in the ass?  Of course I would.  I'd be awful.  I'd kill us both.  I like that question, though.  You would actually get yourself killed.  I like that question.  Do you feel like you need to do that?  No, I flail in fights.  I don't flail in skydiving.  I do what the guy tells me to do.  You make a great point. 
[02:30:00]  The worst part is the lead up to jumping out of a plane.  Once you hit the air, once you get going, man, it all goes away.  So why wait around?  Just get it done.  It's tough.  To me, when I was in high school and stuff, I would lose fights if I had to sit around  and think on it.  If it just happened and it was just boom in the spur of the moment, it just went, I  was always really good.  But if I had to sit there and think about it, I would start to underestimate myself or  start thinking about the repercussions and the consequences and maybe I shouldn't do 
[02:30:30]  this or, you know.  Remember sitting in a classroom and it was like oral report time and you would never  volunteer to be first and you would just sweat it out for like days and days and then finally  go.  The person that would raise their hand and go first was the smart one.  I would always do that.  And then you get to relax for the next three days as they're doing everybody else.  Well, I always think like they're doing that.  Huh?  I would always just think, yeah, I'm screwed.  Might as well get that out of the way.  But he's quickly becoming my favorite UFC fighter now, Forrest Griffin.  Did you have a favorite before? 
[02:31:00]  Did I have a favorite?  That's a good question.  I mean, we were big fans of Liddell.  Yes, whoever's sitting in the seat is our favorite.  Whoever's within fucking punching proximity.  That's, yeah, right there on distance.  Who have we had in?  We've had just fucking Liddell, Rampage, Couture, Fedor.  Fedor was a scary motherfucker.  Just because you can't communicate with him.  I love that dude, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why he's scary.  He's not like a giant dude either.  No, he's six foot.  But he doesn't crack a smile.  You don't know what he's thinking. 
[02:31:30]  He's speaking Russian.  But he looks kind of happy.  Like, happy like, you know, I sat at a press conference with him.  He sits like this.  Like, you know, a good kid in class or something.  I'm like, what's that dude?  That dude's not tough.  I'll beat that dude.  Okay, that dude is tough.  Never mind.  He really does not give off a scary vibe at all.  No, he doesn't.  Jimmy, before today.  This is how big he is.  I mean, compared to me, and I'm fucking little.  He's just, he's like six foot tall.  He's not that big a dude.  Who was your favorite UFC fighter?  Not counting, because we're meeting for us for the first time.  I would say probably Chuck, just because I know him. 
[02:32:00]  I mean, yeah.  I would probably say him.  Rampage was awesome.  Yeah, he's very funny.  Yeah, he's a character.  Rampage is a character.  He hates me, by the way.  Really?  Why?  He took his belt.  I don't know.  No, I don't think they hate each other for that reason.  Something personal?  I don't know.  Rampage, that was right before his, he had a breakdown after that.  Yeah, he was, yeah.  He just, I don't know, man.  It's all good.  I stay out of his way.  You can tell he doesn't like you, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We'll fight again later.  It's no worries.  I mean, what's the point of beefing with a guy? 
[02:32:30]  A lot of you guys like each other outside the ring, so there's, why doesn't he like  it?  Like or tolerates.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I see a lot of strong personalities.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's weird, because you think about it, a bunch of guys do the same thing for  living, have similar backgrounds, you know?  Came from the same socioeconomic classes.  We're very, you know, like-minded, but a lot of times, like-minded people, kind of the  alpha male, you notice that, like, always want to be the thing in the room.  And, you know, too many fighters in my room, it's no good, you know? 
[02:33:00]  Were you, this is a childlike non-fighter question, but were you scared when you're standing  next to, eye to eye with a guy like Rampage, and you're about to fight for the belt?  I mean, what's going through your mind at that moment?  No, you're just ready to fight.  Just like I was talking about the skydiving, you think, what, it's not a fear you can attune  to a certain person, you know?  You know, I don't fear people, but it's the enormity of the situation. 
[02:33:30]  Okay.  See, I would fear that and the person.  That's the difference.  That's why I don't fight.  People are people.  It's not, you know, whatever.  I mean, obviously, I'm fighting Anderson Silva.  You know, that guy's worth fearing, but, you know, there's a ref in there.  Somebody else, they probably won't kill me.  Nobody's died yet.  After a fight where you-  I'm well compensated.  Who cares?  If I die, if I die, the UFC will take care of my camp.  I'm not too worried about it.  Jesus.  When you guys see each other after a fight, like, does the winner, do you guys have, like,  you guys both know that you're fucking great fighters.  Does the guy who won kind of, like, look at the other guy, like, we both know I beat your 
[02:34:00]  ass, or is there none of that because you know that it couldn't went the other way?  Every encounter's different, man.  You know, it's like, I obviously, you know, I don't know, man.  Everybody's a little different.  A lot of guys have, ego is healthy in life and in everything, and a lot of guys, you  know, have an ego, and that's how they do it.  My, the way I do it, most guys, I think most fighters are very confident and think they're  the best, and that's what enables them to do their job, and to go in there and do it, 
[02:34:30]  is they think, they truly think they're the best, and that they can find a way to win.  I think, I'm fucked, I might as well get it over.  It's like, I might as well-  So you're never really disappointed.  You're going to get this ass whooping right out the way.  It's like, holy shit, I won.  Amazing.  Low expectations, key to happiness.  It's in the book.  I would say you look more like a fighter than anybody we've had in, like, he looks like  a fighter.  Fedor looked like a social studies teacher.  He does.  He does not look like a fighter.  Yeah, Chuck kind of looks like a problem, too. 
[02:35:00]  Forrest Griffin, Godfights, the name of the book.  I look like I've been beat up a lot.  Yeah.  Well, there's some great pictures of you.  Like, somebody run a car over his face.  Holy shit.  There's some great pictures in your book.  The one I want to point out, though, is the one with you and your rifle.  Yeah.  And the caption is great.  This is my rifle.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.  That's right.  You're a full metal jacket fan, huh?  What is it?  Yeah, of course, man.  Come on.  Ant loves his guns, too, there, Forrest.  That's actually, that joke right there is supposed to be a ripoff of Super Troopers. 
[02:35:30]  I'm supposed to be saying to Graham Mannard right there, and that's the story of the third  time I got herpes.  But I don't know.  Like, stuff happens.  Don't they change it?  Yeah.  I didn't intend.  Like, it didn't make sense, but it wasn't supposed to.  It was an inside joke.  Actually, the whole book is just inside jokes, like movie quotes between me and my friends.  So there's about 50 or 60 people out there that are going to get it, and the rest of 
[02:36:00]  us are going to be like, what the hell is he talking about?  We did the same thing in here, man.  Something about movie quotes and just blurting them out that makes you crack up with your friends.  There's a photo here of, I think it's Rashad Evans.  Forrest is on his back, and Rashad is about to punch down on him, and the quote is, Forrest.  And the waiter says to the jockey, so that's how I got the football stuck in my ass.  Because that's the quote.  I love the fact that it's not a bunch of fight quotes.  Yeah.  I don't think we did the book justice, because the more you look at it, there's a lot of  jokes in here, there, Forrest. 
[02:36:30]  I mean, what'd you expect?  Like, techniques on fighting?  Well, that's what the other guys are writing, so it's good to know that you're doing something  a little different.  I would say be in great shape and be moderately athletic and relatively large.  That's my advice.  Oh, what?  You're not 6'3", 230?  You're screwed.  Fight Club, this movie actually ruined my life.  Instead of taking it as a black comedy, I took it seriously.  For the longest time, I contemplated giving up all my worldly possessions and living like  a Native American.  But seriously, we all really should wear leather clothing, because that shit lasts longer than 
[02:37:00]  cotton or spandex.  Yeah.  No problem.  So you got all these words.  Chuck Palahniuk's got a new book out.  I haven't read it yet.  I heard it's kind of whatever.  You know what?  I don't know what to think.  I'm a huge fan of his books.  Yeah.  I either love them or hate them, though.  Yeah.  I've liked...  Have you read most of them?  I've read everything he's written except the last two, the one about the snuff and Pygmy.  Snuff was rough to get through.  See, that's the thing, man.  I feel like every author, every movie maker, everybody, Quentin Tarantino, everybody's 
[02:37:30]  got a story to tell.  And kind of like almost once they've told their story, what's the kind of force?  Not everybody can be Stephen King, you know?  Some people have that great work, and then after that, it's whatever, you know?  No one can compare it to Stephen King.  But, you know, Chuck Palahniuk, really, he's got like five good books.  They could all be great movies, I think, you know?  They blew Choke.  Choke could have been a great movie.  They fucked it up.  Oh, you're kidding me.  I loved it.  No, you're...  You like Choke?  I loved it.  I loved it, loved it, loved it. 
[02:38:00]  I'm not going to argue with the UFC fighter over Choke.  It makes it better than...  What were they supposed to do with it?  I thought the book was...  I like...  That was my favorite book he's written.  Really?  Choke?  Yeah.  Choke?  How do we explain Choke?  It's a movie about a guy that likes to be choked almost to the point of unconsciousness during  sex.  This, among many other sexual proclivities.  Is it like an auto-asphyxiation type thing with a belt, or does he like someone to do it?  It's a...  You know, you got a spotter there.  No, actually, you don't have a spotter.  You have another person choking you.  It's even better. 
[02:38:30]  Try it.  I've had a...  Please, I've done it.  I've had a chick choke me.  I've had girls, like, slap my dick a little bit, which I kind of liked.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm more into dominating, but I kind of like...  This one girl who used to massage me, I'd be like, just slap my balls.  And she would kind of like...  Ow!  Not too hard.  No, no, not really hard enough.  Just like a light slap, and I would tell her to bite me.  There was something about...  I only got the one nut, so I'm not any testicle...  You got one ball?  Yeah.  What happened?  I was doing power cleans in ninth grade.  Nobody told me, yeah, you shouldn't lift 200 pounds if you're 13.  I was like, okay, I can do this. 
[02:39:00]  What's that?  And it felt like...  It sounded like a t-shirt ripping, and it felt like somebody threw cold water on my crotch.  And it was really...  It was really cool because...  No, it wasn't that cool, but...  But, like, your body is weird.  It, like, folded me over, like, almost slowly, like a little plant closing, you know?  And then I couldn't move from that position.  I was like, huh, I'm stuck here.  And I walked around like that for a couple days until I went to the doctor.  And they were like, yeah, you should blow your abdominal wall. 
[02:39:30]  Your intestines have fallen on this testicle.  It's come unwound.  We're going to have to take it.  That's the sign of a tough motherfucker when you walk around for a couple of days with your intestine on your balls.  And my nut was the size of a softball, too.  The semi-nestical discal.  Holy...  So they took your testicle.  Yeah, they didn't take that bad boy.  Wow.  You got a fake one in there?  No, I don't.  I like to...  They do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You like to just look at the expression on a girl's face as she's fishing around down there?  You know what's crazy, man? 
[02:40:00]  Nobody ever says anything.  It's like, you know...  It's like, well, you got a little dick.  Girls don't point it out, do they?  Right?  They don't mention it.  They're all cool.  Well, you know, we're not.  I don't mind.  Did you ever hear a girl go this thing when she's licking your balls going, ahem, ah?  Nah.  And go back to it.  Probably not.  That's a fucked up story.  Yeah, there's a lot worse ways to lose it.  I mean, you know, it was just...  Is that story in the book?  It is, actually.  But it's even better.  The 50 Zen principles, the hand-to-face comment, I only wrote 37. 
[02:40:30]  Right.  And I'm pretty sure I actually read the book again.  There's only 37 in there.  I don't know why it's...  They just liked it over to 50.  I think it would be better if it was the 37, but 50's good, too.  It'd be funny if this was, like, a class-action lawsuit now.  Fucking soon as he told us he was going to give us 50, my 50, he gave us 37.  You got movie recommendations, too.  What's your favorite movie of all time?  Yeah, that's a stupid question.  How can you have a favorite movie of all time?  I don't know.  How about favorite comedy?  Favorite comedy. 
[02:41:00]  If you put it in the genre, it's like, I would say probably Caddyshack.  Yeah, genres are doable.  It's my favorite.  Yeah, it's such a, you know...  I like old school.  I don't know, man.  Old school comedies?  Super Troopers.  Yeah.  What about your favorite fighting movie?  There's a Charles Bronson movie, like...  Hard Times.  Bam!  Good job.  That was a good one, man.  Wow.  Never saw it.  With the fucking guy, the bald-headed guy, he put his head down.  You mentioned Hard Times.  It's like the first MMA movie, right?  That was a good fucking bare-knuckle fighting fucking movie.  Oh, like, that's what I thought I was getting into when I was doing this. 
[02:41:30]  I was like, yeah.  I'm getting a pit for 50 bucks and fight some guy.  Probably losing an eye.  Sounds great.  That's a rush.  Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't mention the fucking Bronson movie they based on your life.  Kinjate.  A lot of questions coming in.  Tom in California, did you win a fight after you broke your arm during the match?  I did.  What?  True, yeah.  And I won a fight after my shoulder came completely out and was like a 14-year-old girl's tit sitting up all high over here. 
[02:42:00]  And I was like looking at it.  And I would have quit the fight.  I was looking at my shoulder in shock, like, you know, medical shock.  Like, I didn't feel pain or anything.  I was just like, oh, my God, my shoulder looks like you have a tit.  And I would have quit right then.  But the guy started punching me.  So I just reacted and started going with it.  And I ended up winning that fight.  And then, you know, you don't.  They teach you not to block kicks like this.  But still, instinctively, somebody goes for you.  So you kind of go, eh.  I have a real good, eh. 
[02:42:30]  He shied away and put his arm out.  Yeah, it's radio.  It doesn't work so well.  But anyway.  How bad did you break your arm?  I mean, it's gotten better.  It broke it like.  Who was it that broke it?  Edson Pardot.  Just some heavyweight dude in Brazil.  Did he go through both bones?  No, just the one, man.  Just the one.  And then I didn't think, ah, it's not broke.  And then I punched him.  I started going, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.  Like bouncing around.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. 
[02:43:00]  My arm's just going, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.  Oh, God.  So, all right.  You fought with a broken arm.  You fought with your shoulder out.  And you lost a ball.  How do you hurt this guy in a fucking bar fight?  What do you do?  I'd go for the eyes.  I'd go for the eyes.  Go for that one remaining nut.  I'm very particular.  Kevin from Connecticut, speaking of which, his testicle had become unwound.  And then he just writes, what the fuck?  Like, apparently when you're doing power cleans and you rip out your abdominal wall,  there's some force that your intestines hit your nut with. 
[02:43:30]  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Trep.  I'm not a doctor.  But I do have a piece of Teflon where my abdominal wall used to be.  Trep in Pennsylvania.  Trep.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Forrest, August 8th.  You're fighting for the first time in Philadelphia, PA.  You're fighting silver.  How do you prepare for that fight?  I don't know.  I'm open to advice.  I don't know.  I wasn't really going to prepare, to be honest.  Want the 30-year-old girls to meet you at Starbucks with their advice?  I'm going to listen to the chicks at Starbucks for this one. 
[02:44:00]  Keep those hands up in the circle away from the power.  Yes, ma'am, I am.  Let's go to Brad in Iowa.  Brad.  Yeah, I don't really have good answers for fight questions.  I don't really know what I'm doing.  Well, don't you study his videos and see if he's got a weakness or something?  Yeah, I do.  Let's say I find a weakness.  I'm going to tell Brad in Iowa or whatever.  I'm going to do that.  He's like, all right, I've got a game plan.  Let me tell you what it is.  Let me tell you what I see this guy's weakness being.  I don't know.  Brad in Iowa.  Brad.  Hey.  He doesn't speak English.  I got that going for now.  I fought on the first show he fought on, and he's a really nice guy. 
[02:44:30]  I got to hang out with him a little bit.  This guy fought on the same card as you.  Where was that fight?  On your first fight?  Yeah.  Down in Augusta, Georgia.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Bill Auditorium.  I was a big old fat boy that got beat up real fast.  I was a big old fat boy that didn't train or anything, but it was great.  You're a truck driver, right?  You were a truck driver at the time, right?  Yes, sir.  I remember that fight, man.  It's good to hear from you again. 
[02:45:00]  This is crazy, right?  Yeah.  I just really remember your...  You fought like the 260...  No, it was like 300-pound dude that had every steroid you could know.  What did you make pumped into his brain?  He was like...  No, he was really like 300 pounds with 5% body fat, right?  Yeah, it wasn't a very good, smart idea for me to fight him.  Yeah, but what are you going to do, right?  It was good.  It was good.  Yeah, I'm a little bit crazy.  It was fun.  I really enjoyed watching your first fight.  You made like 300 or 400 bucks.  It was an easy way to make a couple hundred bucks, you know? 
[02:45:30]  That's right.  Pete's working.  I'll make a punch in the mouth for 250 quick.  Bam.  There you go.  That was my opinion.  Wow.  Yeah, it was really great getting to see your success over the years and stuff, and I haven't  fought too much since then, but it's still fun to do it every once in a while.  Well, cool, man.  It's good to hear from you.  It's funny.  Yeah, it's really great to hear from you.  All right, Brad.  Regular love fest.  Thanks, Brad. 
[02:46:00]  You too, man.  There goes Brad.  Let's say hi to Tom in New Hampshire.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Tom.  Tom, I didn't sleep with your girlfriend.  Just right off the bat, I did not.  It was not me.  All right.  Great.  Thanks.  I appreciated that.  Just wanted to get that out of the way.  I was actually, when you beat Shogun Rua, that was just, it was fantastic.  And I was wondering about Amir Sadala, and I know you guys trained together.  Trained together?  We showered together.  No, we go ahead.  Well, that's a little inside tip. 
[02:46:30]  But I was just wondering how.  I've got more.  It's good to improvise that Steve C is.  But I was just wondering how Amir was doing.  I know he's been injured, and it seems like you guys are very similar.  I was just wondering how.  Well, we're both, he's fighting, he's fighting, damn it, who's he fighting?  He's fighting Johnny Hendricks, a Southpaw wrestler, on August 8th in Philadelphia.  And Amir was training with me quite a bit.  He actually lives out in Las Vegas now.  And he went to Holland to train, to train because they have such great wrestling in Holland. 
[02:47:00]  And he's fighting the wrestlers, so.  Retard.  No, he's going to go learn kickboxing for that big K-1 fight he's got coming up.  I don't know, man.  You don't reason with people.  He likes Holland.  He likes training over there.  So he's in Holland.  Brian in Tampa.  Brian.  We're talking to Forrest Griffin.  Brian.  What's up, boys?  What's up, boys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, Forrest, you know what makes him adhering to everybody is that he's just a regular guy.  He doesn't act like he's tougher than everybody.  Right. 
[02:47:30]  He jokes around.  My question is, I know he doesn't have any fight plans or routines, but does he think about  or has he thought about maybe hooking up with some camps that maybe, whatever deficiencies  he thinks he might need, is there one camp or one session that he appreciates more that  he, you know, now he's more of a name?  I'm going to answer that.  Shut up.  Yeah, an opportunity came my way to go up to Denver, actually, to the Olympic Training  Center and wrestle for a couple weeks.  So I think I might do that. 
[02:48:00]  Just go.  It's high altitude.  It's wrestling.  I really want to be good at wrestling.  Like, I think I could do it somehow, some way.  And it's one of those things, if you didn't wrestle when you were a kid, and every time  I quit wrestling, it's like I start back at zero.  Like, I can not box for a little bit and I'll still be okay.  Or grappling, that comes more easily.  But wrestling, it's just like, it's a thought process.  And I still think every time I'm doing it, I'm thinking, what the fuck do I do next?  Whereas everything else just comes natural. 
[02:48:30]  Do you get, like, fucked up when you get taken down on the ground and have to, like,  obviously you'd rather be standing up punching someone in the face.  I don't mind being on the ground.  You know, the problem is when people punch me when I'm trying to do my jiu-jitsu.  It's quite annoying.  I'm like, guys, whoa, I thought when we hit the ground we just did this jiu-jitsu.  I like jiu-jitsu.  Not with the elbow and in the face.  You're hitting me very hard.  That's my eye socket.  My God, why would you do this to another human being? 
[02:49:00]  That's actually what I say during the fight.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  Do you want to hurt me like this?  I would never do this to you.  I was just handed a note.  Forrest was disgusted by Steve's capri pants.  Oh, God.  And we didn't even ask him about it.  Who is it?  Can you bring Steve in?  There's just a big tight ass in front of my face.  Yeah, here's Steve right here.  Not only are they capris, but they're too tight.  Here she comes.  Thank you.  Can you tell him?  Because he thinks we're just messing with him.  I told him.  Because we like to mess with him.  I told him.  Steve, I just got Steve. 
[02:49:30]  Here's a real, real man.  And I don't want to, yeah, nothing I don't cost.  Forrest, don't hold back, please.  Nothing I don't cost more than 10 bucks and my wife didn't buy, so.  Yeah, no, I wasn't even, like, trying to be insulting.  I thought that was a joke that he had those on.  Like, I thought he lost a bet or something.  Like, I'm not, like, I was like, oh, it's humorous, you know?  Into the frying pan out of the fire.  It's just fucking, I just got shredded.  Into the frying pan out of the fire?  Out of the frying pan into the fire, sorry.  It's worse, those are like true religion jeans, right?  Yes, they are.  Those are expensive, crappy jeans. 
[02:50:00]  Wow, this is exactly what we bashed him about.  Don't put them in the jean category.  Put them in the gay category.  The capris.  Culottes.  Remember culottes?  He's wearing culottes.  Sam, what's up?  He just said on the gay channel, they cost $220.  Oh!  Oh, really?  Come on, yeah.  And you got shredded by the...  Oh, they, Larry and Keith just beat the shit out of me for having, from looking normal  from the thigh up and then completely...  So the gay guys wouldn't even wear this.  Yeah, the gay guys wouldn't touch this.  I got called Laurie Petri. 
[02:50:30]  I don't know what that means.  It's not good, Steve.  Yeah, okay.  It's not good.  Wow.  You know, they called me Laurie Petri.  I didn't think it was fucking endearing, but...  And Forrest said they're really tight, too.  Yeah.  A little too tight.  A little too tight.  A little too...  But you know what?  For $220, it's worth it.  I mean, everybody else at the office is having a much better day because of your pants.  The rest of us have had...  It's $220 worth of a laugh to me.  Yeah, look at that.  The joy you brought.  As long as it's your money.  Well, you sure have a positive spin on things. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  I fucking love Forrest Griffin.  It's hilarious.  We all...  We can all...  I mean, I'm better for having seen this.  But it cheered me right up.  I slept literally three hours last night, and I saw his pants, and I was just excited  to do this.  Like, yes.  I'm the kind of place where they like to party in capris that are tight, nonetheless.  Thanks, Steve.  You had to wear the capris today.  With fringes.  Yeah, he'll come back.  We got Joe Frazier tomorrow.  Bring your sundress.  Is Frazier tomorrow?  Tomorrow, yeah. 
[02:51:30]  Scott in Florida.  Scott.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Scott.  Hey, Forrest.  Big Dime fan.  Big, big fan.  Watched probably every fight you've ever fought.  Thank you very much, sir.  I heard the rumor that they said before that you enjoy getting punched in the face at  the beginning of the fight to wake you up.  Is that true?  You know, yeah.  I've often said that, and that used to be the case.  Something happened along the way.  I got old.  And, you know, I think you get old...  All right, here's the deal. 
[02:52:00]  If you're going to be dumb, you better be tough.  And I've always been tough.  But you know what?  I'm sick of being tough.  Being tough hurts in the morning when you wake up.  So now I'm trying to be smarter so I can not be so tough.  If that makes any sense.  I don't like to get punched anymore.  I used to be into that.  I used to be like, fuck it.  Yeah, hit me.  Let's get this party started.  So the fight would start and you want to take a blow to the face.  Yeah, it wakes you right up.  Boom.  You're going.  All right.  It's better than...  We'll let Jimmy punch you in the face.  We'll see what happens.  It's better than a shit.  I told you.  I'm out of it now.  It's over my face.  It's also, tip in the book, if you're into getting drunk and getting strippers to punch 
[02:52:30]  you, make sure they take their rings off first, especially if you have a fight coming  up.  Rings, facial scarring, bad.  So you think these scars are from cool stuff, like fights, but it's from paying strippers  to punch me in the face and not getting them to take their rings off.  It was a pleasure to talk to you for us now.  We hope to see you again fighting.  Jimmy, you guys... 
[02:53:00]  I like to party.  First time I ever called in, you guys have to answer the phone.  All right, cool, Scott.  Thanks.  Hey, who's...  And this is probably a good novice question, but who hits the hardest?  If you had to pick one that you've ever fought?  You just asked me that.  Well, not the people I've fought.  People that have hit me hard in fights, I couldn't tell you.  I wasn't really there.  I woke up and I was like, damn, he hit me hard.  That was a hard thing.  I was watching...  Jeremy Horne kicked me in the neck and I was like...  I remember...  Well, I don't remember something.  And then I remember arguing with the ref that I'm fine.  Why are you stopping this fight? 
[02:53:30]  And the referee literally shakes my shoulder and points at the replay.  And I said, oh, thank you.  Thank you for stopping that.  I could have been killed.  Oh, my God.  I was like, whoa, that happened?  I was like, whoa, this is...  It was surreal because I was like, that didn't just happen.  I didn't feel like I'd been knocked out.  Take a look.  I was like, oh, oh, he kicked me in the neck.  It's the part you were unconscious for.  Oh, my God, he gave me whiplash.  Wow.  Is there any sense of embarrassment after you get knocked out and you're getting off?  Fuck yeah.  It's horrible.  It's the worst feeling in the world. 
[02:54:00]  You just got turned off.  In fighting, like, if you can turn somebody off, that's the thing.  It's like, man, I could have raped your ass when you were down there.  You know, I used to knock people out in the street and we would actually pull their  pants down and tape them to light poles.  You would actually carry tape in case you hit somebody?  I would have athletic tape on me.  You just taped them to, like, a light pole.  Is that not...  Is that not...  You're not supposed to do that?  That's great.  God damn.  People are saying best UFC guest ever.  Yeah, I agree. 
[02:54:30]  Has to be said.  Todd on Long Island.  That's my mom, ironically.  Todd, what's up?  Todd?  Who's Todd?  I don't want to talk to anyone.  That sucks.  His question is, have you ever had unorthodox training like chasing a chicken?  What's that, Todd?  Todd.  Where I'm from, we chase sheep, but that's not fight training per se.  It's for fun.  Are you familiar with Stump Broke, son?  Ah.  That's when they could back right into that stump. 
[02:55:00]  Oh.  Or the boots.  You've got to get the sheep's feet in the tops of your boots.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Every good animal fucker knows how to run.  Yeah, he likes to party.  Or in a pinch, you just break the front legs of the animal, so it has to kind of...  So it's got to bend over with its little animal ass up in the air.  We should play him our chicken audio.  Oh, it's horrible.  If you're a fan of that stuff, we got an audio of a German guy having sex with a chicken.  For real, though?  Yeah.  And you hear the chicken kind of crying.  The chicken objects.  I mean, I don't speak that language. 
[02:55:30]  Do we have that for Forrest?  No, it's not, man.  It's horrible.  I'm not saying it's a good thing.  I mean, joking about it's one thing, but I mean, actually, like, going through with it,  that's pretty horrible.  Hearing it's awful, and filming it's worse.  Let's see how much you can get through.  Go ahead.  Oh.  It's no video.  It's just audio.  Audio.  Great soundtrack.  This is seriously disturbing. 
[02:56:00]  It's not happening yet, though.  The old pedophile talking.  It's not happening.  You can hear when it starts.  Yeah, learn.  Learn.  Tell us when it's happening.  I thought I was fucked up.  All right.  All right.  I must say, you guys, you guys have taken me to the limit.  It takes a lot to make me uncomfortable.  Apparently, chicken fucking.  Yeah, I did.  Good call. 
[02:56:30]  Be the game producer in capri pants and chicken fucking.  He'll be back soon.  Apparently, I do have a, yeah.  I didn't think I was easily shocked or dissuaded, but I'm impressed.  You know, I usually do these radio interviews where you can't even cuss, and you guys fuck chickens.  Holy crap.  Oh, my goodness.  Let's go to the Bronx.  Tony.  Tony from the Bronx.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Forrest, actually, I live in Huntington, Long Island, and I see you at the book. 
[02:57:00]  I'm going to definitely come.  What night are you going there?  Oh, shit.  You know what?  I have no idea.  He's got two signs.  That's a good question.  Tonight, you're heading out to Huntington to sign the book, Got Fight, at the book review.  The book review?  Tonight at 7 o'clock.  In Huntington tonight, and tomorrow, he's doing a great, it's a great independent bookstore  in New Jersey called Bookends.  It's probably a half hour outside of Manhattan, so if you can't get out to Long Island tonight,  tomorrow night, Bookends in Ridgewood is a great place to get a book signed.  And the book, Got Fight, is available starting tomorrow.  Thank you, guys, because promoted. 
[02:57:30]  Are you putting in the new windows there?  It looks like the new windows are going in F.H. Riley's.  And I was going to offer Forrest a free dinner tonight.  My restaurant is literally a block away from where you're going to be tonight.  You have a restaurant.  Yeah.  My brother, I mean, asylum part of my brother.  You guys serve chicken there?  Yeah, we do.  I don't know if I'm ordering the chicken, man.  I don't know.  Chicken with ranch on the back.  Marinated.  Well, we're remodeling the next couple days, so we're out.  Are you close?  I would have loved to give you a new outside.  I like the lowbrow.  It's good. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, we have to.  All right.  He was kind of like, oh, I'd offer you a free something or other, but screw yourself.  But we're close.  No, no.  Yeah, I was sorry.  I could give you a few bucks for dinner tomorrow.  You can give me some coffee.  I'm good.  I got to witness the capris, so.  We have to take a break, but Forrest, man, what a great guest.  For real, man.  God fight.  Very honest.  Yeah.  And you know, I tell you why occasionally I do like myself.  Like, I didn't even pick this picture.  Like, I kind of like, they showed me a bunch of pictures, and I'm like, which one do you like? 
[02:58:30]  And I really pointed to the one in which I thought I looked the worst.  I was like, that's not even a good picture.  I look like, I don't even know.  It looks like a mug shot.  It does look like a mug shot.  It's a mug shot.  I like the grooming of the hair.  That's nice, right?  Yeah, that is good.  Grooms via ball cap.  But that's you.  You're not trying to like.  Exactly.  Thank you.  You're not trying to polish it up.  This is you.  Yeah, but.  What's wrong with that?  It's funny.  Like.  They probably wanted.  People don't get that. 
[02:59:00]  They probably wanted you to get all.  They were like.  They were like.  You want to cover your hair?  Let's get a good picture.  It's like, no, that is a good picture.  It's horrible.  And they probably tried to talk you out of that picture, right?  Said, look.  Well, they were just like.  It's kind of a bad picture.  I was like, exactly.  They're like.  You probably sell more copies if you had a good looking guy on the cover.  Well, it's not written by a good looking guy.  So.  Yeah.  Screw you guys.  Got some good quotes on the back.  He's got a quote from Rogan.  A quote from Liddell.  How great is Rogan?  He's good.  Did you hang out with Rogan?  He's good. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  And I've seen his comedy a couple times, too.  Yeah.  I love Rogan's comedy.  Yeah.  It's very different.  He makes you think.  He's good.  Yeah.  Don't.  I went up to him after a show and he's literally covered in sweat, like soaked, sitting there  drinking a water.  And he.  I mean, if you ever seen the show, you think he's like hyper when he does the fights in  his comedy.  He's really fucking high.  And he's sweating and he's just like crazy veins in his neck.  And then, like, of course, I do.  God, I'm such a douche.  I do what everybody does.  You try to make him laugh or tell a joke? 
[03:00:00]  I start telling him fucking jokes.  And he looks at me just like I look at people when they're telling me about fighting.  And I'm just like, really?  Really?  You're going to tell me about fighting?  And I'm like, really?  I'm going to tell Joe Rogan about comedy?  What the fuck's wrong with me?  Shut up, Forrest.  I should be asking this guy questions.  What the fuck?  Was he polite about it, though?  Well, I mean, I saw the sour look on his face and I realized Joe Rogan would rather  talk to me about fighting than about comedy.  Yeah, Joe's a fucking Neanderthal who's funny. 
[03:00:30]  Joe's like by far the toughest comic.  He's the one we know.  You can't fuck with Rogan.  Well, yeah, you know, and that's the thing, you know.  He never, you know, he never like puts himself out there as a fighter, but he'll fight you.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking got some issues.  I like, though, that he says the divide between fighting people and fighting fighters.  He's like, I'll fight people, but I don't fight fighters.  That's a horrible idea.  Get your ass kicked.  All right, let's take a break. 
[03:01:00]  Forrest Griffin.  Book out tomorrow.  Signings tonight and tomorrow.  And we'll go to ForrestGriffin.com or .net.  I'm sure it's got the information there.  Absolutely.  Come back and see us.  We'll be better.  No Capri pants and no chicken videos.  All right, well, the Capri pants, I can handle that.  Yeah, that is kind of funny.  Opie and Anthony.  How great was Forrest Griffin?  Phenomenal.  Fucking great guest.  The book is called Got Fight. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, it was good.  Absolutely.  Man, that guy, he's one of those brawlers.  Something tells me it's not much about, you know.  And why didn't any of us ask about the wound on his nose?  We were too scared to ask him.  I was going to, but I was just like, I figured he'd probably just say it was a training accident.  Yeah, what do you think?  It was pussing, and none of us were braiding up to say, what the fuck?  Vaseline on it and shit.  Just to keep.  Yeah, and the skin had been like removed.  You ever skin yourself, and then you just press the skin back on and glob it with some shit? 
[03:02:00]  I hope for the best.  That's exactly what it looks like happens.  Usually when I dive into a pool and I scrape my nose on the bottom, you know.  Not like him, where someone was attempting to knock his nose off his face.  Beat him up.  But if you would have asked him, he probably would have said, ah, you know, I was training.  You know.  I like when, I love when things happen in here, when there's an ultimate fighter, and then  someone goes, ah, I shouldn't be asking that, he's an ultimate fighter.  And it's just like a question, but wouldn't it be great if they actually did just lean  over and punch people whenever they didn't like a question or something? 
[03:02:30]  Well, depending on who they punched.  Yeah.  Well, no one wanted to take that chance, though.  Service with a smile.  The legend of the octopus.  Anyone remember?  Remember when?  Remember?  Oh, it was the hockey.  Yeah.  Started in the 1952 playoffs.  That long ago?  The octopus having eight arms symbolized the number of playoff wins necessary for the Red  Wings to win the Stanley Cup.  The Red Wings were perfect in the 52 playoffs, swept the Maple Leafs and the Canadians, making  the octopus their good luck charm. 
[03:03:00]  They won two out of the next three Stanley Cups, my friend, because of this octopus.  So, in 1995, the Red Wings adopted Al the Octopus as their mascot.  Thank you.  Thank you, all dear friends, for coming to my birthday.  Al the Octopus is a douche.  I hate Al.  Al the Octopus.  Al.  Now what they do, two owls are raised to the rafters before every home playoff game to symbolize 
[03:03:30]  the 16 wins, now needed to win the Cup.  Ew, is that Al?  Look, his mouth is going, rawr.  Look, he's all angry.  Rawr.  We're going to win this.  Rawr.  Rawr.  Rawr.  Al had a stroke.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  Al the Bell's Palsy octopus.  I just want to see fucking Bela Lugosi under a leg going, ah!  Ah!  What?  They should raise real octopuses to the ceiling.  I think the ASPCA.  Who gives a shit about them? 
[03:04:00]  This guy's a cranky old fuck.  Who is he?  This fucking guy.  Oh, this douchebag?  Yeah.  Oh, I saw him in the bathroom.  He's like, ah!  He's the worst.  Like, all right, relax, you cranky old fuck.  Is he cranky?  He's the worst.  He's the worst.  Big dumb shoehorn hairdo.  Nobody cares about you.  Look at the look.  Ah!  This guy.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I'm cranky.  I'm burned.  Ah!  I'm old.  Welcome.  I think you heard that, because the audio is on.  Good.  Oh, well.  Take it.  What are you going to do?  Ah!  You asshole. 
[03:04:30]  I kind of gave him a polite nod.  It was just like, ah!  He's all cranky.  Ah, he's real cranky.  Old cranky guy.  We're waiting for the audio of Steve on, ah, out cue.  I heard they gave him a trash.  Yeah, good beating.  Steve showed up with capri pants.  Yeah, literally.  Capri pants.  What, Francine?  What's up?  I think those are possibly the gayest pants I've ever seen on a man.  Even his bulge is showing. 
[03:05:00]  What are you eating there, Francine?  His, uh, you can see an imprint of his penis on, through his pants.  What are you eating?  Well, it's a banana.  Oh, okay.  Jesus.  Banana.  A banana.  They have potassium.  That's K on the scale of energy.  The scale of energy?  You mean the periodic table of elements?  I failed that class two times.  Of course you did. 
[03:05:30]  Of energy?  I hated that chemistry shit.  No one likes it.  No one likes it.  It was very difficult.  I don't doubt for you.  Yeah, that was.  So the first time I tried, I think I got a D.  Which is pretty good, considering I tried.  Yeah.  And then the second time, I just slept.  I was like, I'm not even going to try this.  And she got a B.  She's not even going to try this.  She rules.  It was too much stuff and chemicals and.  That's what chemistry is.  Chemicals.  That's why it's called chemistry. 
[03:06:00]  So the first project I had to do, the lady was like, well, if you get any of this crap  on your hands, it's going to turn a different color and it's going to be like that for like  two weeks.  So I was like, I think I'll just sleep.  Why would I do this?  This is stupid.  You know, in an odd way.  There's some logic there.  Yeah.  She almost makes sense.  There's some logic there.  Yeah.  It's like when one of my teachers told me in ninth grade, she said we have to touch a  snake so we could feel the similarity of the birds to the dinosaurs.  And I was like, why would we touch a snake? 
[03:06:30]  They're scary.  Right.  So I failed that class too.  I was actually the biology teacher with his fucking zipper open.  You have to touch the snake, Francine.  She was a woman.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  And the snake was a garden snake.  So she said, oh, you shouldn't be afraid of garden snakes.  But I was like, it's a snake.  Right.  Good point.  There's a lot of logic there.  Ain't touching this motherfucking snake in this motherfucking classroom.  So go fuck herself.  Mother freaking. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  That was private school.  I got kicked out.  A private school?  I went to Sandy Spring Friends School in Olney in Maryland.  Friends school?  Yeah.  So what does that mean?  Yeah.  Well, it's a friends school.  It means the Quakers came up with it.  Look at this pig on Tyra.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a Quaker school.  We get to like do Quakery stuff.  Ugh.  Look at this pig on Tyra.  What a balloon.  13 and really fat already.  She has nice hair though.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  That's wonderful.  She is huge.  And she's, again, a flatso.  Look at her boobies.  They don't come up over her belly.  Daryl allows Tasha, 13, to eat whatever she wants.  Oh, he's an enabling fuck.  It has to be a father, right?  Nah, that's a problem.  Where's the audio of Steve?  I mean, Francine's killing, but...  Yeah, come on.  We love Francine.  I have some news if you'd like.  Uh-oh.  Francine has news. 
[03:08:00]  Huh?  Do we have to explain Francine to the new listeners?  No.  All right.  Fuck.  She was our intern years ago, and she and I have a very good relationship.  Aw.  A very good one.  Yeah.  Why?  Why is it good?  We love each other.  Yes.  And if Jimmy had never slept with transsexuals, I would be with him.  Wow.  And if you were a transsexual, I'd be with you.  That was holding you back, Francine?  Yeah.  It's too much for me.  I'm very homophobic. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's why whenever Steve walks by, she just goes, ah, and hides.  I come from a very homophobic family.  Do you?  Nothing against the gays.  It's just, you know, it's my background and stuff.  And I'm Catholic.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You're not a certain marriage thing.  I grew up the same way with other people.  Not gays, but the other people.  It was just my upbringing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just really weird.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, you find yourself, you know, using derogatory terms for certain people. 
[03:09:00]  And you don't really mean it.  It's just the way you were raised.  It's just the way I was raised.  Jesus.  That works with me.  Like, last week, I went out with my model friend in D.C.  Yeah.  And it was a fashion show.  I didn't expect that many gay people to be there.  On a fashion show?  Yeah.  So, some guy comes up to us and starts talking to us.  And he was really, really nice.  And I thought he was straight.  Yes, he was.  And then we're walking towards another club because we were going to go bar hopping.  And he goes, so, you were really feeling that model, weren't you? 
[03:09:30]  And it was some girl.  She was really pretty.  Her name's Kate Michaels.  She's actually really hot.  He was like, yeah, you were looking at her.  You really want her, don't you?  I was like, what are you talking about?  He's like, are you, do you go both ways?  I was like, no, I don't go both ways.  He's, I was like, you know, I'm really into dick.  You know, dick all over my mouth.  Dick all over my pussy and my ass.  You know what he said?  He said, mm-hmm, me too.  Oh, shit.  And I was like, oh, wow, you're gay?  Damn, yo.  Yeah.  So the girl I was with ended up sleeping with him that night, which was so weird. 
[03:10:00]  I was sleeping over.  That's how I knew they slept together.  She slept with a gay guy.  Well, then he must, you know, that's probably a hell of an act he's got then.  Yeah, I'm so gay.  Is that the chick right there?  She's pretty hot.  She is.  That's your friend?  I saw, I met her there and I was trying to get her card so we could be friends, but she didn't.  Oh, you wanted to be friends.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, because she's a model.  She's Miss DC 2006.  What does she pose for?  Longneck.com?  Jesus.  She sure she doesn't live in Loch Ness? 
[03:10:30]  She's really pretty.  She is, if she has a fucking long neck.  I think you're hating too.  Jimmy spoils everything.  I'm not.  Why do you spoil everything?  She's beautiful.  Look at that neck.  All right.  I like a girl who can eat an apple out of a tree.  Well, the neck is a little long.  Of course it is.  All right.  You have to meet her.  But it's statuesque looking.  She's very pretty.  Let's go to Dano in Kentucky.  Dano.  Hey, good morning, everybody.  Good evening.  I was wondering, did you mean garter snake?  It's a garter snake, not a guard snake.  Yes, it is a garter snake. 
[03:11:00]  What is that?  A black chick.  Prejudice against trainees.  Do you believe that shit?  Miss Danage.  Miss Danage.  All right.  Francine is just trying to find a reason why she shouldn't love me.  Oh.  That's all it is.  She's afraid of our love.  Well, you're sitting on his lap there, Francine.  So you, you know.  I sit on everybody's lap.  Don't make me not feel special.  Okay.  I don't sit on that.  I'm at a girl.  We've discussed this.  I'm a little muscular there.  Where's our audio?  I'm very cooperative.  Oh.  What do you mean by that?  Are you?  Yeah.  You're like submissive? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm into cavemen.  But you don't.  But I remember you saying you don't give blowjobs.  And last night I didn't.  And I think the guy who's dating me is going to dump me now.  Because you're not blowing him?  Yeah.  Why aren't you blowing him?  Well, I'm really afraid of AIDS.  That's pretty much it.  What a nerd.  What is this guy doing?  That makes you afraid that he has the AIDS.  Well, when we were going out like five years ago, he cheated on me with his girlfriend. 
[03:12:00]  Which was really, really bad.  So why are you back with him?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  Low self-esteem?  Yeah.  Probably.  Yeah.  When she's 29.  Yeah.  You're ready to flip the odometer.  Francine, how could he cheat on you with his girlfriend?  Good question, Dan.  That got past us all.  Yeah.  Very good.  Well, we were going out for about, I think, a month or something.  And I thought, okay, maybe it's time we had sex or something.  So I had sex with him. 
[03:12:30]  And then after he had sex with me, he rolls over and goes, my girlfriend's going to be  here in like six hours.  So you need to leave.  Whoa.  Yeah.  So what'd you do?  Left?  Yeah.  Six hours?  No.  My girlfriend's coming back from a trip next week.  You've got to get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, I know.  She's it.  She just boarded the red eye.  Can you go?  Yeah.  It was a very bad experience.  But you're bad for them, so it wasn't that bad.  Um, I guess so. 
[03:13:00]  Is he good?  Does he treat you good?  Well, he pays for everything.  I mean, you know.  You like when guys pay for everything.  Sexually.  Yeah.  Most guys will do that.  Yeah, he's pretty good.  Yeah.  Did he go down on you?  He did last week.  So I guess that's why he was expecting it.  Oh, okay.  So how was he expecting it?  How did you know he was expecting it?  Did he say, could you suck my dick?  Yeah, pretty much.  Or did he position himself?  And what did you say?  No?  I said, no.  Maybe next time or something.  Oh, and then what happened?  Did he go like, oh, fuck.  Well, he was like, you're going to lose me if you don't start sucking my dick. 
[03:13:30]  That's for him.  Class act.  You're going to lose this fucking special man here if you don't start sucking my dick.  Boy, what a keeper you got.  Thank you.  Did he lick your pussy good?  He was all right, you know.  What was wrong?  That's no good.  Yeah, what was wrong?  He was all right.  That's terrible.  I've had better.  What was he doing wrong?  Maybe you could teach the guys out there.  Yeah.  He didn't go down long enough.  He didn't make you cum?  Um, not that time.  Oh, boy.  And he's awful.  Yeah.  He's awful. 
[03:14:00]  He did it in between the Cavaliers and the game that they were playing with the other people.  So that was pretty special.  The magic.  In between?  What do you mean in between?  In halftime?  Yeah.  Oh, so he had 15 minutes.  Pretty much.  We got the audio?  Yeah.  All right, good.  The filler's over.  Thanks, Francine.  Well, that was...  You're quite welcome.  Pretty good filler.  No, Francine does very, very good for us.  We love Francine.  All right.  She's with a sexual dud, though.  Why don't we start with this?  Sam took Steve and his capri pants into OutQ, the gay channel here at SiriusXM. 
[03:14:30]  The guys don't really like us.  Well, they changed their opinions a little.  A little bit?  Yeah.  All right.  And how did it go?  It went well.  They were also not approving of Steve's wardrobe choice.  Really?  Yeah.  They thought he looked like a giant asshole.  Really?  Not in those words, but not in a good way.  We got some highlights.  Steve going on OutQ with his capri pants.  And the question that began our last hour was, if you were a big old butch straight guy, 
[03:15:00]  why are you wearing Laura Petri pants?  Okay.  Why is it suddenly 1962 when you were on the Dick Dan Dyke show?  Okay?  What's up with that?  What's your damage, Heather?  So, he's here.  Say hello.  Wait, what the fuck's going on?  They just called Steve a heifer.  A heifer?  Shit, it's funny.  So, they were talking about Steve way before we went...  They did a break early this morning, apparently, because they saw Steve walking around near 
[03:15:30]  their studio in his awful capri pants.  And so, they were trying to figure out why somebody like Steve would dress in those pants.  And I guess that was their break earlier today.  All right.  All right.  Now, we'll play this audio.  And the question that began our last hour was, if you were a big old butch straight guy,  why are you wearing Laura Petri pants?  Okay.  Why is it suddenly 1962 when you were on the Dick Dan Dyke show?  What's up with that?  What's up with that?  What's your damage, Heather?  So, he's here.  Say hello. 
[03:16:00]  Introduce yourself to the kids at home.  Fucking assholes.  You walked in.  You walked in.  You walked in.  Wearing capris.  Don't be mad.  Wearing capris.  Okay.  I'm wearing Wranglers.  And I'm the gay guy in the room.  But go ahead.  For the record, this will be the last day.  Hi, I'm Steve.  Hi, Steve.  I'm the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  So, that's how the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show makes his presence felt for the very first time on LQ.  That's how he was introduced.  And the gay guys wearing Wranglers.  Yes. 
[03:16:30]  Great.  Great, Steve.  Anyone notice that the gay guy sounds like a Muppet?  Steve explains his pants.  So, we go to get coffee.  When Steve said fucking assholes, was he commenting on what they were doing when he walked in?  Yes, he meant that as a fucking verb, not an adjective.  So, we go to get coffee.  We're minding our own B.I. business, trying to get back in the room before Christine W. stops singing her song.  Like good old Queen should. 
[03:17:00]  Exactly.  And there he is in, and they're homemade.  Okay.  Capri pants.  You know why they're homemade?  Holy shit.  Did he make these pants and that's why we can't find them on the fucking website?  No, he's claiming that they were purchased.  He's adamant.  Wait a minute.  He had his chick.  Hold on a minute.  These guys are saying they're homemade.  Danny's been looking at the True Religion website all morning.  We can't find the fucking pants Steve's wearing. 
[03:17:30]  The website has a similar pair, but it is definitely not the pair he's wearing.  It is not the pair he's wearing.  Yeah.  His fiancee called their show and did say that she bought them.  So, for what it's worth.  So, we go to get coffee.  We're minding our own B.I. business, trying to get back in the room before Christine W. stops singing her song.  Like good old Queen should.  Exactly.  And there he is in, and they're homemade.  Okay.  Capri pants.  You know why they're homemade? 
[03:18:00]  Because, honestly, we're not supposed to have capri pants.  Because, honestly, boys our size, they don't make them for us.  They don't make them for us.  But I got these.  These are true religion, like, guy shorts.  Or are they Lane Bryant?  Did you buy them at, like, a fat woman's store?  No, really.  Let's break it down.  I think they were, actually, to be completely honest, my fiancee bought them online.  Your fiancee?  Yeah.  You know?  I believe it that.  Oh, damn.  Looks like some radar went up in that studio. 
[03:18:30]  I'm telling them.  Fiancee.  Mm.  Yeah.  All right.  Holy shit.  Sure thing.  He's getting his ass kicked.  He thought he was just going to go in there, and, like, the gay guys are going to talk about  his fashion.  Oh, my God.  That smashed to bits.  Bought them online.  Your fiancee.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  I think I wouldn't have bet, Keith, how long he would mention his female partner.  That's all right.  But clearly, she has her own plan right now, because she's letting you walk around like 
[03:19:00]  that.  But that's another story.  Because, honestly, ain't nobody going to do it with you.  Okay.  Don't worry about the chick sitting on your nose capris, baby.  Maybe they're girls' capri pants.  That's what we're thinking, too.  That would have to be a big girl.  Yeah, they're big girls.  They make plus size now.  I'm saying we can't find these capri pants.  I'm telling you.  Danny's still looking.  We can't find them.  I'm looking on eBay, thinking, well, maybe they've been discontinued.  We can't find them. 
[03:19:30]  Maybe they were on sale.  But the guys from our queue are saying that they're homemade.  I think they saw the phrase.  Maybe they're true religion fucking jeans, and then they were cut up to look like capris.  I hope not.  But if they were last season, they're probably not going to be online.  All right.  She brings up a point.  I love shopping.  They continued just killing Steve.  Yeah.  So at what point, I guess the question is, at what point do these become shorts?  Ever?  Or if I took a scissor and...  Above the knee.  Above the knee.  Above the knee.  So if literally I took a scissor and cut these things above the knee. 
[03:20:00]  They would become shorts.  They'd be shorts.  And then you would be the guy wearing shorts at work with them.  Sam disagrees.  With very, very tight shorts.  Well, they're not that tight, because honestly, Keith, should I say it?  Wait.  Let me say it.  No package.  Oh.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  The room just got cold.  No package.  Wow.  The gay guys say Steve's got a little thick.  They are fucking tearing him apart. 
[03:20:30]  Did Steve punch at all?  No.  Did he get any lines in?  No.  Steve got no lines in.  Nothing.  What the fuck, Steve?  We all know how good he is at improv.  He's the best.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, you.  When would these be shorts?  I'd like to take the comedy bit and make it informational.  He did the same thing he does in here.  He just re-presented the situation at hand.  Yes.  And they called him Heather, right? 
[03:21:00]  I don't know.  Did they?  Yeah, yeah.  No, Heifer.  Heifer.  Oh, it sounded like Heather.  It did sound like Heather.  They called him a heifer because he's fat.  It did sound like Heather.  Steve-O.  Wait, dude.  And finally this.  That is funny.  Steve-O now cute with his capris.  So now, you know what those are in when two gay guys see that?  It's like he needs extra padding on his knees for when he goes down on somebody.  Work.  Because scrape knees are not a hot look. 
[03:21:30]  Wait, do you have a leg tattoo?  Yeah, I do.  What's that?  It's an orchid.  Okay.  An orchid?  Mm-hmm.  Were you a florist in another life?  What's the tea orchid?  You know, it's just I thought they looked pretty.  I saw them.  They looked pretty.  Yeah.  This big book fan is talking about his tattoos is pretty.  Sweet people are zany.  Aren't they insane?  Go on.  So he got his wardrobe.  He's not allowed on that show anymore.  No, he sounds perfect.  He sounds like the third mic. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, he's making us all look bad.  He does sound third mic on that show.  They did say that they would come on our show.  Could you rephrase that?  A rhyme?  He got killed.  Yeah, he got, she got the cum joke.  Of course he did.  It's the U.  It's the U.  Oh, nice.  Very good.  Wait, what happened?  The cum joke.  Francine said, you will come with a U.  Yeah.  Oh, very good. 
[03:22:30]  But yeah, they just, they just bashed Steve's defense.  That's, uh, all right.  Did you really think that Steve was going to get his shots in?  Not one in.  I was hoping he would get one in, Dan.  That's what I was saying.  He didn't get one in?  Not one.  Not even a jab.  There's no editing, editing trickery.  Of course not.  There's no jabs to be gotten.  Not one jab.  None.  Zero.  Donut.  Jesus.  All right. 
[03:23:00]  Yes, I just thought that I would put them on with my shoes.  Thank you.  So you get a flower tattooed?  Yes, I do.  They grow in the earth.  Let's go to Lady Trucker.  It's the worst fucking improper in history.  LT, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hello.  Yeah, that second segment you played, the, uh, uh, guys are, it was gay talk for, uh,  uh, uh, Steve's wearing women's, uh, pants. 
[03:23:30]  What do you mean?  What?  What do you mean?  I'm punching out.  Uh, we were trying to go, I don't know what she was getting at.  Oof.  Uh, uh, let's say hi to Steve in Ohio.  Steve.  Hey, how are you guys?  Good.  Hey, you cannot let him leave the studio without having Sam do a tasteful, fashionable photo shoot,  you know, a la George Costanza on the sofa.  Oh, that would be kind of, yeah, we're going to get some more shots of Steve's Caprice. 
[03:24:00]  And we should put him in that Lane Bryant shirt again and just do a really nice photo shoot with him.  I agree.  Dominic.  Dominic.  Just repeated what he said.  Dominic.  There's no reason.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hi, Dom.  Welcome aboard.  Hey, Jimmy.  Uh, if you want to check to see if they're real jeans or not and not just Caprice,  just check to see if there's an inseam, uh, on the tag.  Oh.  An inseam.  Oh.  Well, if there's, if there's a length, obviously it's, there was supposed to be jeans.  Oh, then there was supposed to be a certain length. 
[03:24:30]  Good one.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Someone go do that immediately before he pulls the tag off.  That's right.  Go, my God, they're on to me.  I have a weird feeling that they are homemade.  I don't know.  Maybe his girl made them.  That's what I'm saying.  I think they're real.  They look real.  I'm good at telling real stuff.  Are you?  Yeah.  Well said, Francie.  I'm good at telling real stuff.  What do you like in the news lately? 
[03:25:00]  Um, I was commenting on Obama's Sotomayor pick and a couple other things.  Obama what?  Sotomayor pick.  Sotomayor?  The justice pick.  Oh.  Oh, you like the pick for the Supreme Court?  Um, I thought it was really bad.  And why?  Well, it wasn't really bad.  I just thought it was kind of like, it was a bit much.  Like, obviously, okay, we have to, you know, put minorities in here because, uh. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, exactly.  So, I just.  I'm sorry.  I just thought maybe he should have not been so obvious.  Yeah.  What, uh, Broadway show did he go see?  I don't know.  Over the weekend?  There was some, uh, like, black Broadway show.  Hey, it was, uh, it was about Bush.  It was called The Lion King.  Ah!  I get that.  Liberal comic Jimmy.  Ah, that's good.  Oh, uh, no bones for PA.  You mean homo-made. 
[03:26:00]  Yes.  I think that was pretty good.  I know.  It was great.  Homo-made is pretty good.  Yeah, he, uh, he went and saw some very, you know.  Oh, Prince Harry is hot.  What was it?  He's a red-faced idiot.  African play?  Would you let Prince Harry, uh, let me just go see Rock Your World?  Yes, I would.  Would you let him shoot inside?  Yes, I would.  Would you let him hit you in the shitter?  Yes, I would.  Wow.  He's royalty.  I'd suck his dick. 
[03:26:30]  Fair enough.  Sam?  It just says size 42.  The tags all just say size 42.  It doesn't say waist or length.  It just says 42.  It's a 42 extra Q.  There's something, I'm not dropping this one.  There's something going on with those pants.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Will Steve admit that his girl, like, made them?  He is insisting that he pay $220 for those pants as they are.  All right, you could pay it for the jeans and then cut them into capris, though. 
[03:27:00]  He says there was no cutting.  All right.  That's what he says.  That's what he says.  The phones aren't that great right now.  All right.  You want to do one more and then we'll get out of here?  Yes.  What else do you like in the news there, Francine?  There's some gay priest in Brooklyn who doesn't want to stop the...  He wants to stop legislators from making it easier for sexual abuse victims to, like, sue the parish. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I thought that was pretty interesting.  He wants to make it easier or harder?  He wants it...  He doesn't want them to make it easier for them.  Well, I would have.  He's a part of the parish.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I comment.  So I comment.  Oh, my God.  Let's play this.  Crazy.  Some people become famous for things they've done.  One young bride-to-be is becoming famous for what she hasn't done.  She's never kissed her fiancé or any boyfriend, for that matter. 
[03:28:00]  King 5's Alyssa Hahn has a story that's new at 10.  So, buddy, you did have a good day at work?  Mm-hmm.  In a day and age when abstinence till marriage seems more the exception than the rule, 21-year-old Rachel Welch decided to take it one step further and not kiss anyone till she married.  She made the decision when she was 14.  That'll keep me out of trouble, and I just wanted that to be a special gift for the man I was to be married to.  Welch and her fiancé, Todd Ritter, met through their church youth group. 
[03:28:30]  Ritter has kissed other girls in the past, but he found Rachel's approach refreshing.  Finally found someone who really respected herself, and so that made me respect her even more.  What do you think of that one, Francine?  She's not even kissing.  She's lying.  You think she's lying?  Why?  She probably sucked cock instead.  How do you not kiss guys?  Are you serious?  She doesn't kiss nothing until she gets married.  One of my friends told me that in countries where there's boarding school and stuff, because he went to boarding school. 
[03:29:00]  Did he?  Yeah, he did.  No, but in countries where you say, well, if your husband knows you're not a virgin, he's not going to marry you.  He said they just do it in the butt instead.  So I think it's just natural to just want to do it.  So how do you not want to kiss at least?  Yeah, she's got some kind of issue, right, Francine?  She's fucked up.  Either that or she's really ugly and nobody wanted to kiss her anyway.  She didn't kiss them, but they would rub clear stuff on her lips at the end of the night.  Back to you. 
[03:29:30]  Back to you.  Let's say hi.  We got more of the pants.  Matt in Philly.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just pulled this up online.  It looks like in European women's sizing, 42 is equal to a U.S. size 12 in women's clothing.  So this could very well be a size 42 European women's clothing.  Steve would never be a 12 in women's clothing.  No way.  Come on.  Size 14. 
[03:30:00]  Wait.  How big is a 12, though?  12 is up there?  No.  Look at fucking Frederica Bimmel.  14.  Oh, the other one, actually.  It was a size 14.  14.  Yeah.  All right.  I thought, Matt.  Politicians.  Matt, I thought you were onto something.  All right.  I heard.  I heard.  I heard a woman.  Thanks for nothing.  Matt just laying in front of the door.  I liked that.  Matt's trying for us.  Thanks, Francine.  That was pretty good.  Anyway, he's bums.  So, Francine, she doesn't kiss guys.  She's lying.  She's got a...  Is this a fiance?  They are getting married?  Mm-hmm.  I want to see a picture of her.  I don't believe it. 
[03:30:30]  What do you think they do?  They're not kissing.  So what do you think they do to show affection there, Francine?  That's really nuts.  Like, when I was, like, 12, I used to think about boys.  So how is she 21 and hasn't kissed anybody?  And there she is.  Fucking prude.  She's all right.  She's a lying cunt.  Who did she...  No many guys probably tried to bang her.  Are you serious?  Oh, my God.  If she said she was a virgin, I'd believe it.  But not that she hasn't kissed anybody. 
[03:31:00]  No way.  A lying cunt.  All right.  Let's see what she does for affection.  Rachel credits her parents, particularly her mother, for her resolve and self-respect.  I made her know that.  I said, you're a prize.  The couple admits it isn't easy.  They find other ways to express their affection.  We rub noses and we give hugs.  If I'm over here and everyone's in bed, I go home.  You know, just because we don't want to put ourselves in a place where we know we might stumble. 
[03:31:30]  But you can bet on their wedding day this July, there'll be added anticipation and anxiety when their pastor says, you may now kiss the bride.  A lot of my guy friends think that, you know, oh, that's what if she's a terrible kisser or what if there's just no sparks.  It won't be.  Which are things I'm not I'm not worried about.  And I know because I love him that it doesn't matter if it's a really good kiss.  We have our whole life to to work on it.  Oh, stop it. 
[03:32:00]  This is the biggest mistake you can make.  Here's what's going to happen.  They're going to kiss.  It's going to suck.  They're going to fuck.  It's going to suck.  And then she's going to be all frustrated.  He's going to be frustrated.  They're going to fuck other people.  And this marriage is doomed.  Francine, that's a comment.  I think she was sexually abused by somebody in her family.  How could you not want to have sex?  Or kiss people.  Holla.  Her uncle probably did her.  She's a good girl.  No, she's not.  We're missing another angle here.  She's a weirdo.  We're missing another angle.  She's a fucking queer.  She's weird. 
[03:32:30]  Joe in Nebraska has another angle.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Joe.  Hey, you know what it is?  If anybody's ever seen that Richard Queer movie back in the early 90s, you don't kiss a fucking  whore.  She probably does everything but kiss.  And no one asked her about the other.  I don't mind having a big one in my ass.  I took a shot in the jaw from the cock.  She won't take the fucking tongue or the fucking lips.  What do you do for affection?  I'll lay him on the bathroom floor and shit in his mouth.  That's why I don't kiss him. 
[03:33:00]  She probably gets fisted.  Oh, it's not shit on my ass.  Yeah.  Go away.  I like your thought there, Joe.  Impossible.  Have a good one.  Punch it out.  Joe in Nebraska.  That's hysterical.  I think we see...  I take it in the ass and I'm fucked silly.  I've had gang bangs and everything.  But I don't kiss.  I'm the cracker with circle jerks.  They need to run an STD test on her.  That's the only way I'd believe it. 
[03:33:30]  Why?  What if she doesn't have an STD?  She might have...  She has to have.  There's no way.  You're so petrified of STDs.  Yes, I am.  What do you have?  I don't have anything.  Yeah, what have you gotten in the past that you got cured?  I got gonorrhea once.  No, wait.  No, it was chlamydia.  I'm sorry.  All right.  It was curable, so I'm all good.  Who gave you chlamydia?  It was my boyfriend.  The boyfriend with the girlfriend?  No, that was another boyfriend.  Oh, and how did he get it?  Probably from another girlfriend.  Well, I would assume from some other girl. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  And did he know he had it when he fucked you?  I don't think so.  And how did you know you had it?  Um, well, it was unfortunate.  My mom found out I was having sex with him, and she took me to get tested, and it turned  out I had the big chlamydia, but they gave me some panacellin, and it was all good.  So it went away?  You didn't have any signs, though?  No, nothing happened.  It's a great thing to have, because you can get rid of it.  It also can be silent. 
[03:34:30]  Yes.  Chlamydia can be silent.  It can make women sterile, too.  I don't know if I want kids, so I don't care.  Well, apparently, from your other story, you don't want kids.  Maybe now?  Um, by the time I have kids, you know, I'll probably be able to make something and leave  it in a jar somewhere, and it will grow.  Oh, my God.  Like one of those potato plants with the toothpicks in it?  Like the matrix.  They'll just grow in a bubble somewhere.  Oh, okay.  And then I'll go to the hospital and pick it up, and I'll never even have to do anything. 
[03:35:00]  I won't carry it.  I won't get stretch marks.  Nothing.  Yeah.  It will be great.  You don't want any of that shit.  No, I don't.  No.  Oh, all right.  Chlamydia.  So that's what we found out.  Unbelievable.  She had chlamydia.  And it didn't hurt.  At one point.  And it didn't hurt.  Well, that's good.  Yeah.  Very happy.  But that's the only thing I've ever gotten.  I've been clean ever since.  Inspirational words.  From Francine.  I had chlamydia, but it didn't hurt. 
[03:35:30]  The Francine story.  Not one bit.  Worse to live by.  That's right.  If you're going to get something, get chlamydia.  That's their slogan, I think.  Chlamydia does a body good.  How about a cold before chlamydia?  If you have to get something.  What do you mean?  You said if you have to get something, chlamydia.  I would say if you have to get something, a cold.  Well, I was too young.  I didn't really know a lot about diseases and stuff.  How old were you? 
[03:36:00]  I was 14 when I got chlamydia.  Jeez.  14?  Yep.  When was your first time you were?  It was my first boyfriend.  He gave it to me.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  Was he a white guy or a black guy?  He was a black guy and he was 19.  Yeah?  And then what, just swear off black guys?  I've dated some black guys, too, you know.  I've done both.  More white than black?  No, I've done more black guys than white guys.  Really?  Yeah.  Because when last I asked you this, many years ago, you had said you'd done more white guys. 
[03:36:30]  So have you had more black guys recently?  I guess so.  Yeah?  Because you're down in D.C., right?  Yeah, there's a lot of black guys there.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you shave, Francine?  Yes, I do.  How much?  Not enough, but I do shave.  Not enough?  Want to show well?  No.  What do you mean, not enough?  You leave some?  I should shave more often.  Oh, more often.  Sometimes I get a little lazy.  Do you shave it all off when you do shave?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And then you let it grow in.  And I'll stubble here and there and then I cut it off again. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I miss Francine.  Me, too.  Can you return again?  Um, sure.  So, you had sex with this guy at 14.  When did you start?  14?  13?  14, yeah.  14?  Mm-hmm.  Boy, and you get chlamydia right off the fucking bat?  But it wasn't AIDS or anything.  You're like, or herpes.  But it's the first sexual experience you have and you get chlamydia.  That's fucked up. 
[03:37:30]  That's all right.  You consider yourself a winner.  I got over it.  We got a guy on the line that thinks he had sex with you.  He probably did.  I had a lot of sex until I was like, uh, probably about 18.  Yeah?  I fucked a lot of people.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Good girl.  Like, how many would you say?  Um, I think by the time I was 25, probably like 65 guys.  65?  I stopped counting. 
[03:38:00]  I love her.  You never told us this.  You always kept it like kind of innocent with us.  Yeah, because I, I don't know.  It's not like, nobody really knows who I am anyway.  I fucked a lot of motherfuckers.  I don't care.  Condoms work.  Oh, you made sure they work on them?  After chlamydia, I had to be careful.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because my mom was like, you could have gotten AIDS.  And I was like, yeah.  But I didn't.  I only got chlamydia. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  So, like 65 guys.  No, that was my 22, actually.  So, I don't know.  Yeah, I slowed down, though, around 19.  Yeah, you slowed down to, what, three a day?  I got to piss.  I'm right back.  Get that whore off your lap.  No, no.  I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to have to tinkle badly.  Yeah.  Can we say hi to Bobby in Jersey?  Bobby?  Yeah, let's see if Bobby's one of the guys that fucked Francine.  Hi.  Hey, Bobby.  Would you like to play, did I fuck Francine? 
[03:39:00]  I'll take dirty cooch for 100, Alex.  Bobby from Jersey.  Why do you think you might have fucked Francine now?  I mean, considering half of New York already has, I'll jump on that boat.  That's half of Maryland.  Do you remember me, Francine?  Francine, you remember me?  We went down in the Bowery?  Uh, I guess.  Bobby?  Well, I'm surprised if you don't, you filthy cum dumpster.  Frunkus!  Apparently, he was lying.  Oh, really?  Well, maybe.  I don't think I've ever done a Bobby. 
[03:39:30]  I've done a lot of stuff.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A lot of Tyrones?  No, not really.  Regular names.  A few.  Kevin's.  Charlemagne's.  Charlemagne's.  I don't do the exotic ones from the projects.  Anfernee's?  Any Anfernee's?  No, Anfernee's.  Anfernee.  They all had regular names.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like, Bob.  Not Bob.  Well, you said no.  I don't remember.  Steve?  The relationships were so short.  A Frank?  I'm pretty sure. 
[03:40:00]  You know what, a Frank?  Yeah, maybe.  Hold on, we got another guy that fucked right now.  Ted?  I fucked Francine!  We got another guy that might have fucked her.  John?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I fucked a mulatto girl I met at the Crow's Nest in New Jersey.  Did Francine ever hang out there?  I am not a mulatto.  I'm a regular black person.  She's a tutu.  Well, you look light-skinned, but did you ever hang out at the Crow's Nest?  Or a Hutu?  I don't think so.  I never went to New Jersey.  Yeah, what are you again? 
[03:40:30]  Oh, okay.  Well, then I might not have.  I'm sorry.  Thank you for the call.  All right.  What tribe are you from there, Freddie?  She's a tutu.  I am half Caribbean and half tootsie from Rwanda.  Tootsie.  See?  The Hutu are the ones that, you know, try to hack apart those.  Yeah, because they're so, like, cute.  You were too superior, I guess.  Probably.  Probably.  You're hysterical, man.  So what happened?  Like, you started fucking and you were just like, I love this fucking. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was good.  So where did you go to get guys?  I, like, had school at friends.  We'd meet at the parks.  But if you were, like, at school and you're fucking a lot of guys,  did you get the label of being, like, the school whore?  Actually, wait a second.  I don't know where I met most of these guys.  Come to think about it.  Oh, my God.  It's too long ago.  Were they older?  What was the oldest, what was the biggest age difference between you and a guy you were fucking? 
[03:41:30]  Uh, I don't know.  I think one time I had sex with this crack dealer.  Of course you did.  He had money.  He's a crack dealer.  And he used to take us out to eat.  He used to take me and my best friend out to eat.  That isn't all that special.  Yeah.  How old were you?  Um, I was 14 still.  You were 14 and the crack dealer takes you out.  And I think he was about 30 or something. 
[03:42:00]  30.  He lied.  He said he was 18 and I thought he was.  But I don't think so now.  And then right when he came, he went,  I'm in my 30s.  No.  Actually, I saw him when he was strung out on cracks.  I guess he started taking it.  That was, like, maybe a year later.  Oh.  And, uh, he didn't look 18 anymore.  No.  All of a sudden that aged the shit out of him, huh?  Yeah.  Cracked at him bad.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, it does that to some people.  Yeah.  I guess.  Other people, I guess.  Yeah.  It works wonders.  So I just came back.  Was the guy, did he bang her or no? 
[03:42:30]  Uh, yeah.  A crack dealer.  A crack dealer.  When she was 14, he was in his 30s.  And you're worried about who Jimmy was with in the past.  Yeah.  But you had sex with a crack dealer.  We used condoms, so it's okay.  So we could use condoms?  Yeah.  Jimmy could get a condom.  What the fuck?  Yeah, try it.  He's been with Chinese.  Oh, don't believe everything I say on the air.  Pack of lies.  Condoms are for faggots.  Huh?  They're the same thing.  They're like, guys.  Oh, condoms.  No, it's not.  Condoms suck.  No, condoms work.  Yeah, I guess so.  I don't care if they work.  I'm living proof.  I could be dead right now. 
[03:43:00]  Probably.  Yeah.  But condoms just don't feel good on a dick.  They don't feel good.  I've had sex with and without condoms.  I'm not talking about you.  I'm talking about me.  If you slide in without a condom, oh, it's the best.  All you're doing when you're fucking with a condom is going,  I wish I had this fucking thing off,  and then trying to get it off without her noticing  so you can just shove it back in.  Thank God it feels the same to you girls  because then you don't know when I fucking slip my thumb 
[03:43:30]  underneath the fucking rim,  and as I pumped back,  snapped that fucker right off,  and then drove it back in in one steady fucking pounding.  I never miss a beat.  That condom goes flying like a rubber band.  Right.  And then I go, oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  What happened to the condom?  Must have came off.  Oh, well, too late.  Welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS.  That's right.  And then while I'm coming, I yell,  here goes the next 18 years.  Blurk. 
[03:44:00]  Blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka.  Blurka, blurka, blurka.  Now then I'll realize, like, right when I'm ready to come  that I don't have a condom on  and go, oh, that's why I had to shoot all over your ass.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  So, you know.  I like it, too.  I think it's like, if 100% is really good,  it's probably like 99.2% good with a condom.  And that's pretty good.  That's how it feels the same.  You did the math, huh?  As far as feeling good.  Very good at math, Francie.  0% with a condom. 
[03:44:30]  I excelled in math.  100% with that one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did you?  Yeah.  Did you fuck your teacher?  Not that one.  How many teachers did you fuck?  No, I only slept with one professor.  Seriously.  Seven times nine.  I don't...  I don't...  49.  You said you excelled in math.  Not only do you not excel in math.  No, no.  I excelled in math when I was in school.  I excelled in math.  When I was in school.  When I was in school.  But that's basic...  Oh, that's great. 
[03:45:00]  Multiplication.  72.  No, it's not 72.  Nine times seven?  How do you not know that?  51.  36.  I don't know.  Who cares?  Nobody's ever going to ask you on a challenge.  Exactly.  You know what?  Who cares?  She makes the best thing.  All right, let's get the fuck out of here.  I agree.  Get ready for Ron and Fezzy.  All right.  Two breaks to take?  Oy.  Sorry, guys.  We'll see you soon, all right?  Definitely.  All right, Francine.  Take it easy.  And remember, Joe Frazier tomorrow and Forrest Griffin was great today. 
[03:45:30]  Forrest Griffin ruled.  And his book looks like it's going to be a good read.  Got Fight.  It's very different.  Yep.  He's definitely tongue-in-cheek in it.  Yeah, he's funny, man.  He's really funny.  There's a lot of comedy in here.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  I'll see you then.  I'll see you next time. </pre>
