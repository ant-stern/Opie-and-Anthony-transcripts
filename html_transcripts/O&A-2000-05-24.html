<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily revolving around their "Whip Em Out Wednesday" campaign,  a planned road show, and various listener calls and interactions.  The show opened with a discussion of the "Wow" sticker campaign, focusing on listener accounts of women flashing their breasts ("wowing") at cars displaying the stickers.  This included a live caller attempting to "wow" while driving, causing humorous chaos. The hosts detailed other "wowing" incidents, from spontaneous to planned events, highlighting the problematic state of their "wow" van (a vandalized tire) and Jeff Norris’s efforts to continue sticker distribution.  They promoted upcoming "wow" sticker stops, particularly one in East Meadow, Long Island, at the Beverage Barn. This segment also involved anecdotes about a runner named Milo Yambag and his Asbury Park Press mention, prank calls, and complaints about NYC tour buses. The road show at the South Beach Dance Club in Island Park, Long Island was heavily promoted, including details of musical acts, contests (a wet t-shirt contest), and an aerial display. A game called "Win Stockbroker Dave's Money," involving women performing acts with vegetables for a video auction, was also mentioned.  The language used throughout was consistently vulgar and sexually suggestive.

Adam Ferrara called in to discuss his new ABC cop series, joking about using Opie as a "perp."  The conversation also touched upon on-set firearm safety, referencing tragic accidents. Ferrara mentioned sending Opie a sound file. Listener calls flooded in regarding the delayed East Meadow "Wow Sticker Stop" due to traffic and large crowds, along with police presence. Joey from Paisano gifted Opie a DVD player.  Opie and Anthony's dismal stock portfolios were a major focus, filled with humorous complaints and unsuccessful listener stock tips.  Other topics included a Knicks game, the Undertaker's WWF return, a revealing high school cheerleading competition on ESPN, and continued "Wow Sticker Stop" updates, alongside the frustrations with their van driver, Earl. The segment also featured a "What's in my pants?" game with a female caller involving suggestive audio descriptions. Sobe beverages and Kid Rock's new CD were promoted.

The road show's promotion continued, detailing its planned extravaganza: musical acts (Stephen Lynch, Q, potentially the Smashing Pumpkins), contests (an "ugly ass" contest, wet t-shirt contest), a dunk tank featuring Spaz (in a Boy Scout uniform, with a plugged-in toaster), a foam area, and appearances by the "invisible man."  Listener calls about the chaotic East Meadow "Wow Sticker Stop," including women "wowing" and police involvement, were frequent.  Other discussed topics included a caller's query on breast size preferences in "wowing," a Flintstones trivia contest, news about Ted Turner, the possible Parkinson's-preventative effects of coffee, and advertisements for the Diamond Exchange and Rockaway Bedding.  Recurring comedic elements included the "I'm over here now" catchphrase and jokes about Spaz's foam anxiety and Opie as a "sex star." Joey Paisano’s presence at the road show was mentioned.

The final segment prominently featured the "What's in My Pants" segment with various callers, including Barbara, who engaged in an extensive, sexually explicit description of herself and simulated actions on air.  This prompted a challenge from another caller, Liz, regarding Barbara’s weight.  William Shatner made a surprise call, briefly discussing his projects.  The road show received further promotion, mentioning various musicians and celebrities (some likely jokes, such as Jimi Hendrix). The segment maintained a highly vulgar and sexually suggestive tone throughout.

[01:04:00]  Felt like crap  Today I'm about  I don't know  75% healthy  But honestly  I got to be on my deathbed  To take a day off  Yeah  Because I mean  Rick and Anthony  You know  It was scary last time  We don't work well together  That's pretty much it  We do not work well together  We need a buffer  Rick does a great job  Producing the radio show  You know  Yeah  Yeah he does  And I have a fine chemistry  And you know  I don't know  Yeah 
[01:04:30]  No I met you guys  A privilege man  I'm the Jets fan  That was there  Oh right on  Yes  You know  And when are you going to get a road show in Jersey man  We promised the next one was going to be in Jersey  We tried  Matt I'll tell you exactly what happened  What's up  You can thank the trade wins  We wanted to go back to the trade wins  They treated us great last year  We made them an S load of money  We had  I don't know  1,400 people there  And we broadcasted live  And it was a huge success  We figured it was a no brainer  We called them up  And they got a little scared on us  Yeah  Backed out  Not going to lie to you  That's not a good thing  We made a ton of calls 
[01:05:00]  And we tried to work it out with them  They said no  And then we had a scramble  And we're very happy  That we're bringing it to Long Island now  We'll be doing something  You're having another road show  We'll be doing something  On the Jersey Shore  This summer  Well I'm going to come see you guys anyway  Yeah you don't got to come to Jersey  But you guys are great  Yeah we'll figure out something for Jersey  Alright  Alright  All right  Thanks Matt  Later  Bye  There's another really good  Oh yeah this one right here  Mike from 49th Street Anthony  Speaking of Stockbroker Dave  I couldn't help notice  That you guys have stopped talking  About your investments 
[01:05:30]  That's one of my favorite parts  Of the show  Stock talk  That and the lesbians  What happened  Does Anthony still own Yippie  I never truly owned Yippie  There is nothing to talk about  As far as the stock market goes  Well what a rebound today  For the NASDAQ  Yeah but  I need to rebound  All of your stocks were down  All of yours were down  My stock  There is nothing to talk about  One of my stocks went up  Two and a half today Anthony 
[01:06:00]  Yeah  That's not good enough  I need this thing to go up ten  Just to break even at this point  And that's only one out of the five I got  Let me check mine  I won't say which ones it is  Let's see  I think we're all just sitting there waiting  You know all our money's  Everyone's money's still in the market  And we're just holding and waiting  For something to happen  Let's see thebigriverinsouthamerica.com  Okay  That's pretty good  That's funny  And then 
[01:06:30]  Wait wait  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Yeah  Okay  I didn't do too bad  No  No  I really can't do anything yet  At least  At least it's not plummeting today  Anthony I need you to check a stock for me  One of my stocks that I forgot about  Okay  You got to figure this out  I'll talk in code  Okay  To blank and beyond  All right  Yes  How did  Oh  That's down to one and three sixteenths  Lovely  Okay  To a thirty and seven sixteenths 
[01:07:00]  My God  That thing was up to forty one  Man  Mmm  Mmm  There's really nothing to talk about  No  Uh  I am going to say  We're in a bull market  A bear market  I mean  Definitely  You get these little rallies  And then they just fall apart  It blows  Like Hope said  There's nothing to talk about  There really is  What are we going to talk about  No one's  No one's raking in the huge cake  They were raking in a couple months ago 
[01:07:30]  A few months back  It's a lot harder these days  I know the market blows  When Anthony comes into the back office  Before the show  And doesn't even go online  I played Half-Life  He plays his Half-Life  I played Half-Life  That's nothing I can do  That's what I'm like  Okay  Because Anthony's  Constantly working it  When the  I can't make the big moves  I can't find the stocks  That are making  The ten or fifteen point moves  In either direction  On any given day  They do five points  Maybe one way or the other  But I need something  You used to 
[01:08:00]  Take a stock like eBay  Mm-hmm  That son of a bitch  Had moved twenty points  In one day  I could care if it was  Going up or down  Just move  But now  I don't know  There's no conviction anymore  Joe what do you have  Hey guys  Straight a joy  What's up  Oh Joe  Although eBay did move  Thirteen points today  That's pretty good  I should have played it  I should have played it  Joe  Oh guys  You still  I can tell you  It was like a morgue  Till one thirty  Today  Yeah and then all of a sudden  Nothing  And then like  The junkies came out guys 
[01:08:30]  The junkies  The people that can't  Stay out of it too long  Guys  I'm telling you  I'm like sitting there  All right  You know  Let's stay small  And then all of a sudden  It was like  You know  Some things start moving up  I'm telling you  The orders that were coming in  It was like  They were on crack  Joe I'm one of the junkies  But I have no more money left  So now I'm going to have to  Start robbing people I think  To get more money  For the stock market  I can't touch anything  That I have in the market  It's scary  It really is  It's scary  Until like  Anybody real  Any real analyst  Come out and say  It's time to buy 
[01:09:00]  I mean seriously  You should just sit back  Yeah but you know  It's funny  You say junkies  It's so true  Because the people  That can't stay out of it  Yeah  It doesn't matter  The market's diving  It's like  Okay it's time to get back in  Yeah  Here it is  And by the way  Screw Spaz  He's going to be  In the dunking tank tomorrow  That should be fun  Be a piece of him  All right Joe  Be a piece of him  Thank you  Maybe someday  We'll play  Traded Joe's Money  Win Traded Joe's Money  If Dave runs out of money  Then you're in Joe  All right fellas  All right thank you  I'll talk to you later  Bye  Bye bye  Jeremy from Long Island

[01:15:30]  I'm like  Oh let's go  I saw some A boobs yesterday  Yeah  Wow  Stalker Patty  I think that's why  I think that's why I was puking in my hotel room after the show  That now it makes sense  Because I was really trying to figure out why I was puking after the show yesterday  I think if a girl is going to wow you for your birthday  She'd at least have the common decency to pull a few hairs from around her nips  Well  Yeah  I went back to the hotel room after the show  I wasn't puking because of the nips  Because the damn hotel doesn't carry the nip game  Right  That pissed me off  I think it might have been Patty's boobs that did it to me 
[01:16:00]  Joey I saw Stalker Patty's boobs  Stalker Patty flashed them yesterday  It was the sickest thing  She walked up  She went  Bam  Flashed  And I saw like a couple like little stubbly hairs around the nippage  You know what it was the sexual equivalent of?

[02:11:00]  For 61-year-old Ted Turner.  It's so funny.  A lot of ladies are outraged.  I was watching one of the talk shows this morning.  Why?  Because he cast in Jane Fonda?  Well, but they're all outraged because, you know, he's going out with a young chippy  there.  Yeah.  What do you expect him to do?  Go to the nursing home to find his next girl?  Of course he's going to go for something young and attractive.  Who said when you go to the dog pound, you get a puppy, you don't get an old dog? 
[02:11:30]  Well, which just, like, completely started just an outrage for people.  What, a celebrity said that?  Yeah.  No, that's, that's, but that's reality.  Oh, God.  James Woods, I think it was, said that because he likes the young girls, you know?  Yeah.  He said, yeah, when you go, when you go to the dog pound to get a dog, don't you want  to get a puppy?  You don't want to get an old puppy.  Yeah, you want that young puppy that you can teach a lot of tricks to.  Teach the new tricks.  You don't want the old dog that's, you know, rubbing his ass on the rug. 
[02:12:00]  Doing that little thing where it sits down and drags itself on the carpet.  Yeah, you don't want the, you don't want to get the old flea-ridden dog.  Oh, another cute little puppy.  Yes.  Jesus Christ, that's awful.  It might make a few messes in the beginning, but it's going to be well worth it in the end.  Of course.  Yes.  Well worth it.  Well, active and fun.  So, congratulations to Ted Turner. 
[02:12:30]  Ted Turner, yeah.  Seems to be very happy with his, uh, new girl.  What happened, Jane?  Jane started falling apart.  How old was Jane?  Jane was, uh, was up there.  Yeah, she was in her 60s, I believe.  That much, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Or late 50s.  I would say, anywhere from 58 to 62, I would say.  And he's got this young, uh, English, uh, English professor, I guess.  Yeah.  28-year-old Karen Rosenfeld. 
[02:13:00]  All right, Ted.  No surprise there.  I mean, guys rarely break up and then go for somebody, uh, older than the girl that they've  been with.  Yeah, no, no, no.  That doesn't usually happen.  That, I mean, that's just reality.  That's what the guys do.  Right.  I, myself, uh, I find it appalling.  Hoping.  Uh, I think it's terrible.  I'm sorry, I got something in my throat.  Shut up.  Who are you kidding? 
[02:13:30]  And Anthony, uh, also, there's another story in the Daily News today.  They're trying to claim that coffee can help stop Parkinson's disease.  How the hell is that possible?  I think you drink coffee and then you, uh, with the Parkinson's, you shake yourself into  unconsciousness and, uh, you, then you're fine with it because you're, you're out cold.  Someone explain to me where, how coffee's going to help Parkinson's disease.  It's just going to make you shake like a car on bad gas.  I don't know.  What, are you going to start giving, uh, Ali some, some coffee? 
[02:14:00]  Some coffee.  Give me some coffee.  I'll take all the smoking.  Give me some of that decon fog.  I'll put that in some coffee.  Hello.  Hello, where am I now?  Oh, first round.  Ring the bell.  That's a stupid.  That's sad.  If someone's got anything on that, please give us a call, okay?  What, are you researching?  No, it just doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  Coffee may help stop Parkinson's disease. 
[02:14:30]  Well, I'm sure it's not the, the symptoms of Parkinson's.  It's probably helps the disease somehow.  But how can you tell, Anthony?  I have two cups of coffee and I shake like that.  Oh, well.  Let's go to Tommy.  Tommy, you're next on WNEW.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Anthony, you ready for it?  What is this?  This is, uh, eight questions.  If you want, I can do a multiple choice.  Eight questions, uh, based on? 
[02:15:00]  Fred Flintstone and the Flintstones.  The Flintstones.  Now, I haven't seen a Flintstones episode in probably three years, I would say.  So it has been a while, but I was an avid Flintstones watcher.  Anybody who listens to the program knows that, uh, I love the Rock Quarry episode.  But I am Rock Quarry.  Hmm.  Gus Schultz.  When I saw this, I figured it'd be right up your alley.  I am Gus Schultz.  Gas station attendant.  Uh. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll bite.  Okay.  So you have eight questions.  Eight questions.  Are they really picky?  Because I hate trivia questions that are just.  Oh, some of them are pretty good.  Yeah.  Some of them are pretty, uh, brain teasers.  All right.  All right.  Uh, uh, what, what, what, what do we give them?  If you stump Anthony, we'll give you something cool.  How about a prize pack and some, uh, wow stickers?  Uh, we could do that.  An O and A prize pack and some wow stickers.  You got it.  That'd be great.  Now, how many does Anthony have to get right?  That's up to you guys.  There's eight questions.  How about, uh, five? 
[02:16:00]  Okay.  Nah.  That'd be nicer than that to the guy.  All right.  Although I might get them all wrong.  Who knows?  You know us.  Either way, the guy's going to get some.  All right.  Go ahead, Tom.  You ready?  Yes.  All right.  Let her rip.  All right.  For which, uh, characters did legendary voiceover actor Mel Blanc provide the voices?  Which characters?  Which characters did Mel Blanc supply the voices for?  Yep.  Uh, Barney Rubble.  Uh-huh.  Um, hold on.  Let me think.  One more. 
[02:16:30]  Barney Rubble.  And, well, none of the, uh, main characters except Dino?  Yep.  Yeah.  Wow.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Hey, come on.  How'd you get that?  I was going to say Mr. Slate, but that wasn't Mr. Slate.  That's what I was going to say.  Okay.  All right.  And Scott, one right.  Go ahead, Tommy.  All right.  What type of equipment did Fred operate in his job at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company? 
[02:17:00]  What type of equipment?  Yep.  Uh, dino crane.  Two.  That's two.  Yes.  All right.  What kind of animal was there a pet dino?  Uh, snort, a snortosaurus.  Damn, that's three.  What was the name of the Flintstones hired woolly mammoth who provided water for doing dishes,  taking a shower, or shaving?  Ooh, this could be a tough one.  The little woolly mammoth under the sink?  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  God damn it.  Yeesh.  Oh, I'm trying to listen to Wilma, like, her voice saying it, but it's not coming to me.  Um, well, I guess I'm going to have to, uh, use my, my lifeline.  Uh, such a final answer.  Um, he wants a lifeline.  Give him, um, multiple choice.  Multiple choice, huh?  Okay.  Edward?  Edgar?  Egghead?  Or Egbert? 
[02:18:00]  Wow.  Uh, Edgar.  Nope.  Egbert.  Egbert?  You were close.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, there's one wrong.  Damn it.  That's okay.  What 1960s sex symbol appeared as herself in animated form and provided her own voiceover  for the debut episode on the fourth season?  Debut episode on the fourth season?  Yep.  Oh, I know that, well, she wasn't a sex symbol, but it was, I know,  Ann Margrock.  Is that her, Ann Margaret?  Yep.  Yeah, okay.  Because I know, uh, what's her name?  Elizabeth Montgomery was on there, too. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  All right.  In that bewitched crossover.  To what social organization did Fred and Barney belong to?  Oh, come on.  Uh, well, that's kind of a trick question.  They were also with the loyal order of dinosaurs, but it was the loyal order of water buffalo.  That's it.  All right, last two.  In the 1965 episode, No Biz Like Showbiz, what career did Fred envision for Pebbles and  Bam Bam?  Oh, like singing stars.  Top musician. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Damn.  And the final one, during the flinch.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  What was that?  What was the song?  Oh, um...  Well, hold it, hold it.  I almost got it.  So let the sun shine.  Wow.  And face it with a grin.  Yep.  Okay, I got half.  That was a noise crap out of me for about four hours.  Last and final one.  During the Flintstones final season, what other popular 1960s show stars appeared as the TV characters within the same Flintstones episode? 
[02:19:30]  The Bewitched thing.  Yeah, okay.  You got it.  All right.  Wow.  That goddamn woolly mammoth under the sink screwed me.  Good job.  That was a tough one.  All right, Tommy, hold on.  We'll give you that O&A prize package and some wow stickers.  Appreciate it, guys.  Have a good one.  Thanks for helping out the show today.  No problem.  Hold on in line.  Elena wants to tell us about Parkinson's and coffee.  Elena.  Yes.  What's up?  Hi, guys. 
[02:20:00]  Do you really know about this coffee and the Parkinson's disease?  I think I know something because Parkinson's, the problem with the Parkinson's is the lack  of dopamine, which is the special stuff in our brain.  So maybe coffee somehow affects the increase of secretion of dopamine and that would help the symptoms.  But I don't think it's any significant.  All right.  Our medical break, Opie.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you, Elena.  Oh, I have a question. 
[02:20:30]  Oh.  Can I?  Yeah.  About wow stickers?  About wow stickers, yes.  Okay.  If I put one on my car.  Yes.  So I suppose the girl is supposed to flash me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of girls out there that want to see other girls flashing them.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No, that's fine.  That's fine.  You might get lucky with a guy if he wants to do some, but that's not what the whole wow  is about.  You know, but whatever.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Got it.  Bye.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Now, we don't really care about the coffee thing, do we?  No.  Jim, what's going on? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  You got it wrong.  It doesn't help Parkinson's.  It prevents it.  It prevents it.  Ah.  Yeah.  20.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  I got it.  Oh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  If you take 28 ounces of coffee a day, you're five times less likely to get it.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And how do they know this?  Uh, there was a study done over a long period of time in England.  Yeah.  A study in England.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  They always end up changing the studies, though.  Yeah.  One moment it says coffee works, and then they go, oh, we made a mistake.  It doesn't do anything.  Well, then they'll tell you what happens is you become impotent if you drink that much  coffee.  So, you know, pick your pick.  All right, Jim.  Cool.  Thanks.  Bye, Jim.  Don't they just drink tea over there?  Yes.  All right, we've got to regroup here, and we'll be back. 
[02:22:00]  Just wowed the sticker stop?  Oh, wait a minute.  Z-Viana.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  What's your name?  Viviana.  Oh, okay.  It's spelled really wacky on the screen.  So, what's going on?  Well, I went where Black Girl is, and he, of course, he came late again.  But guess what?  I was the first girl there, and I was a little scared because it seemed like a whole mob scene.  Everyone was on the van, and they were telling me to whip them out. 
[02:22:30]  And guess what I did?  You whipped them out?  I whipped them out, baby.  And what did the crowd do?  They went crazy.  Yes.  Very good.  Cool.  Yeah, well, and I have really, really nice ones.  So, they're nice and big bees.  Big bees.  Nice and perky.  I loved it.  He got boobies.  This is the first time I was doing this.  Yeah.  And did you feel good about it?  Absolutely.  So, you'll be wowing cars on the highway? 
[02:23:00]  Oh, yes, I will.  Very good.  Want another kicker?  Yeah.  My husband was right there, right behind me.  Oh, cool.  He let me do this.  I can't believe he did this to me.  Very good.  Well, thank you.  Thanks for helping us out.  I love you guys.  You guys are awesome.  We love you.  We'll see you at the road show tomorrow.  Cool.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes.  We'll take a break, Anthony.  Okay.  And if you got anything else for the show today, 212-757-1027. 
[02:23:30]  Booze.  The world's universal language.  I use my breath to get other people's attention.  The world's universal language.  I use my breath to get a break, how do you do it?  Joey and Anthony.  The brain is in their pants.  1-827-WNE-Double.  Joey, see you tomorrow.  Joey Paisano.  There he goes.  How you doing, Joey?  How you doing, Joey?  Joey DVD.  All right.  Joey DVD, huh?  Stop down there.  Paisano's of Mulberry Street.  And he'll be at the Roadshow tomorrow, South Beach Dance Club in Island Park, 50 Broadway Island Park. 
[02:24:00]  Doors open at 2.  Anthony?  Yes.  Stack or 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  It works.  Yeah, they have a new offer.  Did you know about this?  I hear it's good for Parkinson's.  No.  They're so confident that you'll love the product and lose the weight that they will send you a free trial size with each order, Anthony.  Nice.  You can't beat this.  Stack or 2, the world's strongest fat burner, has helped thousands of people lose weight, build lean muscle, and get into shape.  You'll feel the effects of just one stack or 2 fat burning capsule within 45 minutes or your money back, Anthony. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Eat what you want and still lose weight.  No more midday cravings.  Stack or 2 takes care of that, too.  It does the three things.  It burns the fat.  It crushes the cravings.  It's a snack in between meals.  And it gives you a boost of energy when you're petering out, I should say.  It certainly does.  Late in the day.  Log on to Stack or 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  They have a website.  Yeah.  You said log.  Log.  www.stacker2.com or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHTLINE. 
[02:25:00]  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  If you give them a call now, you might be wearing that banana hammock this summer.  Are you training me?  Stack or 2?  Are you getting me back from the diamond exchange?  Oh, no.  Not at all.  All right.  You should have started earlier because now we're done imagining.  Stop eating and get the body you always wanted, Anthony.  Beavis on Stack or 2. 
[02:25:30]  This is hysterical.  Stack or 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Our listeners have proven it works.  Give them a call.  1-800-LIGHTLINE.  Static X.  You're listening to the sounds of Static X. 
[02:26:00]  Static X?  Static X.  You hear those commercials on, like, the radio?  They play, like, 30 seconds of a band?  Yeah.  Static X.  You're listening.  Well, I think the sticker stock has come to a close, Anthony.  Static X.  Wow.  Somebody just sent pictures from the sticker stock.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  You've got to love technology.  Let me see. 
[02:26:30]  Of, uh...  I'm still...  Chris, what's going on?  Look at this.  How you doing, man?  All right.  I'm from my sister.  My friend just came and picked me up.  He was coming out from work.  And, uh...  I came here to see some breasts.  You know what I'm saying?  See some women.  Drink a beer.  And the cops are kicking everybody out as we're arriving.  Really?  So it's not even 6 o'clock here, you know?  I mean, it's up in 6.30.  I'm a little disappointed.  Wanted to get my thing going here.  And, uh...  Cops are running there for everybody.  What's going on? 
[02:27:00]  Well, how many people were down there?  Wow.  It was a ton of people.  But, like, all the girls, like, left probably immediately.  And now, like...  Hello?  They're all gone.  Now everybody's gone.  Man.  And I was pretty bummed out.  Wanted to drink a beer and see some breasts.  Well, sorry about that.  I think it got a little too big because someone just emailed us pictures from the sticker stop.  And it looks huge out there.  It was.  It was pretty big, man.  Mad cars.  Everybody was parking, like, very far away.  Wow.  That chick, though.  Wow.  That was a nice set.  Well, thank you, Chris. 
[02:27:30]  Let's see some pictures, man.  All right.  Come on your website.  We will.  Man, what do you got over there?  What's...  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  Look at that, girl.  The funniest part about this picture is, look at...  Oh, yeah.  Look, there's a little kid, right?  Why are you bringing little kids to a wow sticker stop?  And there's a chick.  Look at the little kids.  Look at the boobs right here.  Those aren't bad.  Those are very nice.  I don't understand why you would bring a little kid to a wow sticker stop.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  You know...  Look, boobies.  You know, Anthony...  Yeah.  Man, we should put the road show on the internet tomorrow.  Oh, how can we do that?  Well, I don't know.  Hmm.  I don't know.  Can we get the...  There's going to be a lot of people...  A lot of people that can't go for one reason or another.  And it would be so great if we were just snapping off pictures left and right and just throwing  them up on the internet.  Oh, I got your skills.  Yeah, just skills.  Constantly updating them.  You know, getting 20, 30 pictures and throwing them on. 
[02:28:30]  You know?  Wow, look at the crowd.  I love today's technology.  Yeah.  We're getting pictures from the sticker stop already.  Reconnaissance aircraft have come back.  There's got to be five, six hundred people outside the beverage barn in East Meadow.  I don't know when this was taken, but wow.  Oh, man.  What an ugly crew.  I'm just kidding, man.  I don't know if we could do it, you know, for this road show, but how cool would that 
[02:29:00]  be?  Well, you know, you're stuck at work.  You can't go to the road show tomorrow, but you could just, you know, constantly, you  know, check, let's say, the WNW website and there's just 20, 30 brand new pictures  every, you know, half hour.  That'd be great.  Steve C's going to be there, right?  Yeah.  On the website.  Yeah.  If we could find a phone line, I got a laptop, we could snap some pics off and upload them  to the site a couple of times, an hour or something.  Well, bring your laptop.  Let's try to figure this out.  Yeah.  That's the last piece of the puzzle for tomorrow.  Cool.  I talked to Scott, you know, our, you know, computer guy. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  And I guess there's not enough phone lines or something out there.  Hmm.  Hmm.  We just need one.  Yeah.  Just to plug into it, upload some stuff.  That would be huge, though.  Yeah.  Let me go to Matt real fast.  Matt.  Hey, Matt.  Yeah.  Turn on your radio.  That's a delay.  You're live.  Kill it.  Hello.  Hey, Matt.  Kill it.  How are you guys?  Great.  I'm over at the sticker stop.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You got a lot of people here. 
[02:30:00]  We see.  They're handing us pictures.  Oh.  And the wows we're getting over here.  You got a bunch of wows?  Oh, yes.  Cool.  Definitely.  We're very grateful.  Did they break up the sticker stop at this point?  Yeah.  You know, they started chanting to some female officer with them out.  Oh, you guys.  You got mad.  See?  Well, you know something?  You guys are a little crazy.  Yeah.  You kind of push it a little too far, don't you?  You're all like Rick.  Poor Earl.  Over the top. 
[02:30:30]  Earl couldn't even get out of the van.  Wow.  Earl was stuck in the van while they were handing out the stickers.  They got it from a Negro.  Man, this girl is fine.  Let me say that one.  It's the same one that you got.  Black and white now.  All right, Matt.  But it was very successful.  A lot of wowing going on over there in East Meadow.  Absolutely.  You know, listen.  I'll take Earl's job.  I'll be early.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  He gets so many wows for those tickets.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Bobby real fast. 
[02:31:00]  Bobby.  Hey.  Hey, Bobby.  What's going on, man?  How are you?  All right.  Yeah, that chick was pretty nice, man.  I'm surprised she did that because there was two mothers and their kids standing right  there.  Yeah, we see the pictures right now.  And she goes, you guys ready?  And of course, all the guys, you know, there's a couple of big construction guys there.  Yeah, man, we're ready.  And sure enough, she let him up.  What are you, the guy with the dark shirt on?  Yeah.  He was fun.  He had like a little water bottle in his hand. 
[02:31:30]  He was like, yeah, man, go ahead.  So she did.  And then as she's driving by, she just got off the phone with you guys.  She did it again.  Oh, that was the girl.  Okay.  And the cops were right there.  I don't know.  You know, they didn't really care, but...  I just don't understand why you would bring two kids under the age of 10 to a WoW sticker  stop.  Because I was walking behind them going to get the sticker and they didn't know what was  going on.  They thought it was like a little accident, I think.  And they were just walking.  Yeah.  And then they stopped.  They saw the commotion, but they didn't know what we were doing.  Right.  And then before you know it, boom.  The girl was like, yeah, I'm going to do it. 
[02:32:00]  And she did it.  Cool, Bobby.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Later.  Appreciate it.  Here's the guy that sent us the pictures.  Raul.  Hey, guys.  ONA.  What's going on?  What's up, man?  I sent you the pictures.  I see you got them.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Check it out.  Those kids, right?  There was a store there and those kids, I guess their parents owned the store and they  just came out.  Oh, man.  Because I'm looking at these two little kids and I see a chick.  Wow.  I took them exactly a half hour ago as the van showed up. 
[02:32:30]  Good job, man.  We love that.  Getting the instant pictures like that.  Hey, I would do that live thing for you guys tomorrow.  But I'm in the Army.  I have training tomorrow.  No, no.  Go ahead and do it.  We're going to try to figure something out last minute.  I mean, you know, we understand if we can't pull it off, but we'll try.  Thank you.  If Earl gets out of there.  Yeah.  Cool.  Thank you, man.  You're good.  I guess somebody likes the show and says, you're over there because who said what? 
[02:33:00]  The feedback on that Dice-Shay McMahon thing from yesterday is just huge.  You've got to love it.  Just huge.  Both those guys were hilarious.  Yeah.  Shane had some chops to them.  Yeah, he did.  He really did.  Coming right back at Dice.  Well, he's used to getting into the fray.  Mm-hmm.  Not afraid.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7-M-I-K.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I got my new wow sticker down at the stop. 
[02:33:30]  There must have been about, I don't know, 500 people there.  The cops weren't too happy.  But more important than that, I got my first wowing of the season.  It was very nice.  She had very nice breath.  Very nice.  Bravo.  And I know you guys are probably sick of hearing it, but Black Girl doesn't sound very too happy.  He's like, guys, it's only a sticker.  I don't know what the big deal is.  Oh.  And I was kind of like, you know, you should have some pride in what you're doing.  They come out, they do a good job to make a radio show, and you, you know, show up late and don't even care. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, we want people that are motivated, man.  You're such a stick in the mud, man.  We have people that would be out there with the stickers just so freaking motivated.  Who wants it, man?  I just graduated from college.  I'll do it.  I need a job.  Yes, man.  I got nothing to do.  I'll work for minimum wage.  We're going to have to try to figure something out.  Totally.  Syndication in Dallas room.  I'll see you guys later.  Thank you, Mike.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Another successful sticker stop.  There you have it.  Yeah.  The police involved.  Something of, you know, we got it.  We have a great rapport with the NYPD, a lot of the Jersey troopers and the Jersey police, even Suffolk County cops. 
[02:34:30]  But that Nassau County, that is a tough nut to crack for us, isn't it?  And we're going to be in Nassau County tomorrow.  I understand.  That's why I'm trying to say I'm reaching out to the officers of the Nassau County.  I think the people at the sticker stop took it a little too far with the chant, whip them out to the female officer.  Well, I'm sure the cops got to understand. 
[02:35:00]  I'm sure a few of the cops were smiling behind her back.  What I'm saying is we embrace the police officers of this state.  All right.  Scoop from Northport.  My wife was just driving behind a school bus of kids that could not be any older than 10 or 11 years old.  And sure enough, the good old wow sign pops out.  She just called me laughing her ass off.

But we're looking at sunny skies and 80 degrees for the road show tomorrow.  The weather will be perfect tomorrow for our road show.  Broadcasting live.  South Beach Dance Club in Island Park. 
[02:39:30]  I know you guys are sick of us talking about this, but we want to make sure a lot of you  guys get out over there and join us in the festivities.  50 Broadway Island Park.  Oh, yeah.  On Long Island.  Doors open at 2.  21 or older.  No cover charge.  We don't even need to go over all the crazy, zany things that are going to be happening  there, okay?  Just going to be a huge spectacle.  We've never had a disappointing road show.  Some have been better than others, but they've all been a lot of fun.  You will be assaulted by entertainment from the sea, the land, and the air. 
[02:40:00]  That's right.  Where else?  What other radio show will assault you with entertainment from air, sea, and land?  I couldn't think of any other one.  Unbelievable.

[02:40:30]  Yeah.  No bones from Jersey.  What I learned yesterday that Shane O'Mac knows how to play Mary had a little lamb on  a touch-tone phone.  That's true.  Let's see.  What I learned, yeah, quickly, I guess we pound a couple out early.  Money from the pictures with the invisible man will go to charity.  Yes.  That must mean aunt's girlfriend's name is charity.

Earl learned today that he could quit and still keep his job.  Yeah.  Purr from Jersey.  I learned I'm not the only sicko who watches high school cheerleading on TV.  Yeah.  Come on.  Booga-loo-galoo.  I'm over here now.  Please.  Who wasn't watching that? 
[02:41:30]  All right.  I'm just trying to get through all these.  Sorry, Anthony.  That's okay.  I'm trolling.  Today I learned that I learned less than I did yesterday.  That's from the Yankee bleacher creature.  Syndication when beer is back in the Bronx bleachers.  Yeah.  I don't think that'll happen.  Donald from White Plains.  I learned that seeing a pair of A-cup breasts with hairy nipples will make a person puke.  Mm-hmm.  Syndication say what now?  Tim from Montgomery, New Jersey.

How are you?  Good.  I want to know if I can play What's in My Pants.  Oh.  Well, we played once already today.  Oh, no.  We're trying not to do that all the time because we don't want that game to get old.  Oh, I know.  Where are you, though, Barbara?  Let's see if we want to do this right now.  Okay.  Well, I'm in Jersey. 
[02:43:00]  Okay.  Convince us to play What's in My Pants.  Yeah.  Tell us a little bit about yourself and why we should play What's in My Pants with you, Barbara.  I'm laying on the bed with my bra and underwear on.  Okay.  Opie, we're going to be playing What's in Barbara's Pants.  Do you have the theme song for What's in My Pants?  Now, Barbara, what do you look like with those bra and panties?  Okay.  I have brown hair and eyes.  I'm about 130, 140, something to that effect. 
[02:43:30]  Uh-oh.  Wait.  No, no.  What I'm saying is that is a very, very key 10 pounds.  130 to 140, depending on your height, which is?  5'7".  5'7"?  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.  You're still in the game.  See, you were about to upset me because I'm in love with you, Anthony.  So, I wanted to come into the studio today, but then I decided against it because I thought  maybe you guys would rip me a new a-hole. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Of course, we'd like to.  We can be a racist.  Oh, Barbara, no.  No, we don't do that.  We just do fun things with asparagus.  Oh, good.  Yes.  Okay, well, yeah.  You don't have to be able to stick the pieces of asparagus in your balloon nut.  Only if Anthony Cointins.  Oh.  Barbara, please.  Only if you eat it off me.  Oh, my God.  There is nothing that I find more disgusting than food and sex, by the way.  Oh, okay.  Well, let me have a look.  I do not like that.  You ever see the HBO specials where they're pouring, like, food? 
[02:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay, forget it, then.  This is fantastic.  I think food and sex are great.  I put Jell-O and whipped cream and nuts all over my girl and peanut butter.  Oh, God.  And then I start licking it off of her, and it's just an erotic thing.  And meanwhile, I'm gagging.  We're looking at the TV like, ugh.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I didn't have to gross you out.  That's okay.  Don't worry about it, Barbara.  Okay.  It was pretty hot in that movie.  About nine and a half weeks?  Yeah.  Everyone says that, too.  It was.  But when they do it on real sex with the fat couples, it's a little different. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, my God.  You know, they don't show the after effects of that, either.  What, you want a dried piece of corn on a chick's thigh?  You're looking like, ugh.  Yeah, it's over here now.  Over here now.  We've done some food shows, Anthony.  We should bring that back.  That was fun to watch.  To watch.  I'm not talking about like that.  I'm talking about a guy and a girl getting together with food.  Yeah.  All right, Barbara.  So, what kind of boobs do you have?  Let's speed this up here.  Okay.  My size is 40 triple D. 
[02:45:30]  40 triple D.  Yes, 40 triple D.  Now I know where that extra 10 pounds went.  Those are really huge.  Exactly.  Well, it doesn't look that big, though.  I haven't had people look at me and say, oh, my God.  Are you spilling out of your bra right now?  Yes, I am.  And what does the rest look like as far as measurements?  Like, how big is your ass?  Well, unfortunately, I have a butt. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, she's got a big ass.  Okay.  All right.  What kind of panties do you have on?  Bloomers?  Big grandma bloomers?  No, they're not big grandma bloomers.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, why don't you get naked there?  Take the panties off.  Okay.  Okay.  Take your bra off and lay on your back and tell us what's going on with those boobs.  Let us know if they hit the bed.  Yes, they do.  As you lay on your back, your boobs hit the bed.  Yes, they do.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Of course, if you'd like to come over and lay with me, I'd enjoy that. 
[02:46:30]  Um, no, that's quite all right, Barbara.  Thank you.  Thank you so much for the offer.  Are you...  So, Barbara...  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, my God.  Oh, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  So, are you naked now?  Yes, I am.  All right.  Lay on your back.  Okay.  And the boobs are just on the bed now?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no.  No, no, they're not.  Oh, my God. 
[02:47:00]  But, yeah.  All right, Barbara, can you give us a motorboat before we play What's in Barbara's Pants?  Of course.  Okay, you know how to do the motorboat?  Yes, I do.  We love the big-breasted ladies to do this for us from time to time.  Okay, I'm going to start laughing again.  Make it a good one.  Okay, wait, let me put the phone down.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Okay, hold on.  Can you hear me?  No.  No, you've got to, like, move it, man. 
[02:47:30]  What?  Back and forth.  And kind of juggle them around a little bit.  Oh, my God.  So it goes like, you know?  You guys are killing me.  Hence the motorboat.  Okay, hold on.  A lot of girls.  Oh, sorry.  Whoa, that sounds like a jet ski.  Oh, my God.  A jet ski.  Liz is saying you're not worthy of playing What's in My Pants?  What?  Liz, yeah.  Oh.  You're completely naked, Barbara. 
[02:48:00]  Yes, I am.  Very nice.  Let me see what the problem is with Liz here.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Liz.  Hello, guys.  How are you?  Barbara's not worthy?  No, just for the simple fact.  First of all, she said she weighs 130 pounds.  Yeah.  And what size bar are you, Barbara?  Triple D.  Triple D.  And you're 130 pounds.  Yeah.  The whole point is, guys, you need to limit it to, you know, any fat girl lying in bed in  her bra and panties is going to want to rub the phone up against her on Friday.  Wow.  Girl, listen, you sound like you're out of breath. 
[02:48:30]  How do I sound like I'm out of breath?  Listen to how you're talking.  You can kind of tell who's fat and who's not, okay?  And you sound like you're fat.  So what I'm trying to tell Opie and Anthony is you really need to limit it, you know?  You think so?  Yeah.  Don't you?  I mean, you just said that you're going to play this whole game out.  It's cool.  Once in a while, you get one chick calling out one, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But now she's calling to rub the phone up against the privates.  Come on.  Yeah.  Do you want to play, Liz? 
[02:49:00]  I'll play, but no.  We'll draw the line there.  Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, Liz?  Five-eight.  Five-eight.  Opie.  Yes.  Black hair.  Half Filipino, half American.  Whoa.  Look at you.  You're good.  That means you go.  Pinol.  The Filipinos go, Anthony.  Yeah.  They sell their children over there.  Intersect.  Great.  No, I haven't sold my son.  Uh-huh.  Oh, dear.  All right.  Well, let's just get back to Barbara.  Yes.  All righty.  But you make a good point, Liz. 
[02:49:30]  Okay.  That's all I want to say.  If she wants to rub the phone, fine.  Enjoy it, Barbara.  All right.  And love you, PJ.  All right.  All right, Barbara.  Oh, God.  I have nothing to say to little C's like that.  Oh.  Wow.  All right.  Trunk and stomach.  I don't get that.  Okay.  Why don't you rub the phone there, Barbara?  Sure.  Now, am I going up and down?  Yes.  Go up and down first.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on. 
[02:50:00]  Is that good?  Jesus.  Hello?  Yes.  Yes.  Now, go side to side.  She's got a muscle.  Slowly.  She's got a muscle right in her mouth.  Muscle.  Okay.  You guys are laughing.  That's bad.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Now, go in a circular motion.  Slowly, though, please.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Barbara, do you have a machete nearby?  Do I have a machete? 
[02:50:30]  Uh, no.  That's the exact sound that the big snow shovel made when I was trying to pick up the dead cat off of my...  So, I'm going to say dead cat.  Dead cat?  Well, um...  Do you have a calico in your lap?  Do the...  Calico in my lap.  A calico.  Do the...  That's some cat humor.  Do the side to side a little slower this time.  Okay.  And a little longer than you've been doing.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, hang on. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Oh, my God.  Sounds like a static from Radio Hanoi.  I don't even want to know what this is.  All right.  Barbara.  Yes.  What's your nationality?  I'm white American.  Italian?  Italian, yes.  Oh, okay.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

[02:52:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm trying to...  Go ahead.  Say dead cat.  Hold on.  I'm thinking more like Don King's head in my leg lock.  All right.  Yes.  Sounds like that when I used to use that sandpaper on my model airplane.  Oh, my God.  I...  I'm going to say a full 70s Earth Mama Muff triangle.  We're both saying the same thing.  Oh, my God. 
[02:52:30]  Far brown.  Yes.  Not that we care, but what's in your pants?  Oh, gee.  Actually, it's a Hitler mustache.  What?  Yes.  Stop it.  I swear.  Redwood Forest.  Look.  You want to look?  Oh.  Oh.  That's more like a...  Okay.  What's his name from Laurel and Hardy type mustache?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well, Barbara, very sexy look you got there.

But you must be in shape.  Okay.  Yes, I try.  Thank you, Barbara.  You're welcome.  Take care, guys.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Good job, Barbara.  Okay.
