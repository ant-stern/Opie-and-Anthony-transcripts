<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a call from Brad in Toronto, who inquired about online listening.  The hosts discussed the show's syndication.  A subsequent caller, Cheryl, a nanny, recounted a brief, humorous encounter with a Black woman and a crying white child, speculating on the child's care.  She then mentioned a radio host, Ron Cooby, who'd made a joke about Afghan women removing their veils. This transitioned into a discussion about the changing situation in Afghanistan post-Taliban, focusing on images of men shaving their beards and unveiled women.  This led to the announcement of "Shave Your Bush for Bush," a campaign encouraging women to shave their pubic hair in support of U.S. troops and President Bush, with prizes for the most hair removed. Several female callers expressed interest.  The hosts also discussed plans for related merchandise.

The show then veered into a segment featuring audio clips from a graphic exorcism, described in detail by the hosts with mockery and crude jokes, including sounds like "boop" and vomiting.  A caller, Larry, defended those attending religious retreats against the hosts' derogatory terms.  The "Shave Your Bush for Bush" campaign was revisited, followed by a bit featuring Dice's professed religious conversion, expressed with highly inappropriate sexual language regarding the Virgin Mary and Jesus.  The hosts responded with laughter.  A listener shared a story about a classroom exorcism, prompting a lengthy discussion about childhood physical punishment, with graphic details of spanking methods and personal experiences.

The broadcast included a caller's limerick, details about Flight 587, and a preview of the "Cherry Darts for Xbox" competition.  A "stoner chick" contestant was interviewed.  A phone interview with Paul Williams followed, touching on his career, recovery from alcoholism, and a heated exchange with Opie about addiction.  The "Cherry Darts" game then commenced, featuring contestants throwing marshmallow-covered cherries at Ivy, a woman from a gentleman's club, accompanied by crude humor and commentary regarding Ivy's body.  Scott won an Xbox with a bullseye. The stickiness of the fluff was a recurring topic.

A subsequent segment focused on the next day's "Shave Your Bush for Bush" event, featuring a "stoner chick" Jen, who agreed to participate.  The conversation involved graphic sexual innuendo, vulgar language, and discussions of female genitalia.  Sal, a t-shirt vendor, confirmed shirt production, and Joe from The Good Rats called in to promote their shows.  The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn?" segment, where callers shared crude and humorous takeaways from the broadcast, referencing Afghanistan, sexual acts, and the hosts' behavior, followed by a final promotion of the pubic hair shaving event.

Yeah.  Taking it slow.  You got it.  You should do it to a Rush song for Toronto, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Modern day warrior, mean, mean stride.  And it's the bull airwaves.  That's all it's like.  That's not bad.  Screaming red bocetta. 
[00:03:00]  In America.  In America.  Hey, is it snowing up there yet?  All right.  We got a little bit this morning, man.  I'm just hoping that we don't get dumped on really bad because I'm hearing up north of  here in Thunder Bay.  It's just coming down.  That's just called the North Pole, my friend.  Oh, dude.  I'm telling you.  Get any colder up here.  My dog wants to come in the house.  I got a 190-pound Rottweiler and this dog don't want to stay outside anymore.  It's too damn cold.  Cracklin' Rose.  It's fly by night away from here.

Give us a call, all right?  All right, man.  I'd love to come in and say hello, man.  You guys rock.  Bring your flap heads down here.  Have they started that lake effect crap in Buffalo?  Um, no.  Oh, the lake effect snow in Buffalo.  We've been lucky.  It just wears you down.  Yeah, dude.  It snows every day in Buffalo until the lake freezes.  Crazy stuff, my friend.  I did three fine winters up in Buffalo, and I'll never forget it. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah, you worked in Buffalo for a while, didn't you?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  At a station called The Fox.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Every city had a station called The Fox.  Fox.  Yeah, we got one up here, too.  I think we got The Wolf.  The Wolf?  Ah.  Oh, there's a lot of wolves around the country.  Same mess, you know.  What do they play on The Wolf?  Oh, you know, all the, actually, The Wolf's not bad.  You get, you know, you get, you know, your new, like, stain and stuff like that.  Yeah.  All right.

All right, because, uh.  You guys take care.  We could use that.  Thank you.  There goes Brad.  It echoed with the sound of salesmen in blue jeans.  Cheryl.  Hi.  Ah, Cheryl, call me now. 
[00:05:00]  What's up, Cheryl?  Hi, guys.  For your free reading.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Are you working today?  Yes, I am.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a psychic.  You're not a psychic?  You don't read the tarot cards?  No, no, I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm a nanny.  Oh, you be calling to find out about him.  You should be calling about yourself.  You're a nanny?  Yeah.  A nanny, and that's your first job.  You have to have ten other.  You're Jamaican.  Right.  You Jamaicans know how to work. 
[00:05:30]  I like that.  Hey, are there any white kids missing today?  Any white kids missing in New York City?  I don't think so.  Something happened in my head today, and I felt like I should have called the top.  Opioid is too awful.  What happened?  Well, I was coming out of the subway, 53rd and 7th, around there.  Yeah.  And this kid was kind of crying a lot, and he was a white kid.  Uh-oh.  And this black lady was, you know, had his hand and was dragging him along the street. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, it's just his nanny.  But I didn't know, and then I felt guilty that I'm starting to think, well, maybe there's a problem here.  That's his nanny.  But she didn't look right.  Why didn't she look right?  And not because she was black, you idiot.  I've seen, uh...  She just looked kind of, uh, out of sorts a little bit, so I was a little concerned.  Should I have called someone?  Any kids missing in the area?  Nah.  You see that all over.  New York, uh, they got the nannies.  All right.  Anyway, guys, this morning, um, at 6.15... 
[00:06:30]  Yeah?  ...I heard Ron Cooby using Whittle Note Wednesday.  Uh, Ron Cooby?  Yes?  Liberal tree-hugging lawyer?  Right.  He was talking about the ladies in Afghanistan.  Yeah?  And he was saying that they were taking off the things off their faces.  Yeah, because, uh, the Taliban's gone, so now the women are, uh, in Afghanistan.  Right.  And they've taken off their, uh, shrouds.  Right, and he was saying that soon they will be whipping it out on a Wednesday.  Ah, whipping it out.  Well, thank you, Ron Cooby. 
[00:07:00]  There you go.  Giving us props on another radio show.  Okay, guys, and another thing, um...  Go defend another Long Island Railroad gunman.  How do you guys...  Great choice of clients, this guy gets.  Have you guys checked if Odie was on that flight?  Who?  What?  Odie.  Oh, Old Dirty?  Nah, he wasn't on the flight.  He couldn't afford to go on vacation.  We thought about it, though, because Old Dirty is Dominican.  He probably knows a lot of the people that, uh, perished.  He probably does.  In the Rockaways.  Okay, guys.  All right, Cheryl. 
[00:07:30]  Okay, bye.  Always a pleasure.  Don't be a stranger.  I know.  Yes, call us whenever.  Bye, guys.  There she goes, Cheryl.  I can listen to her talk all day long.  Yeah.  With that Jamaican accent.  Those accents are pretty good.  It's pretty good, right?  I like that Jamaican accent on the chicks.  It says par-tay.  It does.  You just feel like smoking a lot of pot and drinking some Red Stripes all day.  It never says, you know, my life is miserable and how am I going to pay my bills.  No.  It's all about...  It's all good.  It's all good.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Nothing bad. 
[00:08:00]  Because that's the accent you get at the resort when you go down to the Caribbean.  Would you like another drink, man?  You're like, yeah, this is the best partying place ever.  They don't care.  Spy report.  Spy report.  What are you, ripping them off?  It's a Ron and Fez thing, but, I mean, the feedback's coming in.  It says, spy report.  Spy report.  Ron and Fez after us here in New York.  They do a great job.  At about 6.15 a.m., Ron Cooby was talking about the Taliban retreat from Kabul. 
[00:08:30]  He was describing how the Afghans were celebrating their freedom the other day.  Some were people pulling out radios, VCRs, and TVs from hiding.  Kids were flying kites in the streets.  Women were whipping their tents off and showing themselves.  Then he said, any minute, whip them out Wednesday, we'll take hold in Kabul.  In Kabul.  Well, we can only dream.  He later said that eventually we will see wow graffiti on the walls in Kabul.  How about that?  You never know. 
[00:09:00]  Speaking of that, how about this?  Kabul men fling off their trousers for death-free soccer matches.  Who would think that you'd have to even think about a death-free soccer match?  You know the soccer stadium in Kabul.  All of a sudden, when the Taliban was in charge there, people would be playing a game of soccer.  All of a sudden, Jeeps would pull up and some of those Datsun or Toyota pickups or whatever.  And guys would get out and drag some screaming poor bastard out of their truck. 
[00:09:30]  Go to the middle of the field.  And all of a sudden, they'd be what amounted to their little halftime show.  Executions.  Throat slittings.  Decapitations.  Maybe just cutting off people's legs with hacksaws.  And yesterday, the first time ever, they threw off their tunics and played a game of soccer without any executions or shootings of criminals and people that are against the Taliban. 
[00:10:00]  So we're moving in the right direction.  I think we're moving in the right direction.  I've seen a lot of pictures from Kabul.  Do these people in Afghanistan have thumbs, Anthony?  Thumbs?  Yeah.  Have they evolved to the point of a...  To the opposable thumb?  That they have thumbs.  I think they're getting close.  Getting close?  A little more.  You can still see where they used to have the gills, where they crawled out of the murk.  Who has more of a thumb?  People in Tennessee or people in Afghanistan?  I hate to say it, but Tennessee.  Tennessee has more of a thumb.  So the people in Tennessee have evolved more than the people in Afghanistan.  Evolved a little further. 
[00:10:30]  It's the simple things now that are making them happy.  You see some of the pictures, though, of the women now?  They're all unwrapped.  They're walking around the streets with their faces held.  Okay, they're all unwrapped.  Do they look hot?  Let me see her.  Let me see her.  Hey, she's not bad at all.  Look at her.  All right.  She's got like that chick you used to party with in high school look.  You know?  All right.  That ain't bad.  She needs a tan.  She hasn't seen any sun in quite a while.  But, yeah.  Well, they're doing all kinds of things now.  And one thing the men are doing, they used to have to go around with those big beards. 
[00:11:00]  The big Taliban beards.  Now, the first thing they did was a lot of the guys shaving them off.  Yeah.  And dancing in the streets to music.  And there was an appliance store.  I don't know how quickly they got this stuff.  There was a ban on television, radio, everything.  Taliban didn't like any of that stuff.  So, there's a picture in the paper from Kabul of a store.  That already has TVs and VCRs for sale?  Crazy Mohammeds.  We're giving it all away. 
[00:11:30]  I don't know what it was.  But it was an electronics store.  And they had VCRs, TVs.  And now people are kind of, you know, seeing what it's all about again.  This might be Old Dirty's new...  The old bee.  New business plan.  Let me tell you, business picking up in Afghanistan.  We made a shipment bee.  A shipment?  I'm an entrepreneur.  Yeah, so things going very well over there.  I'm thinking maybe tomorrow.  You think tomorrow we could have some fun with that?  Well, today we got the cherry darts for the Xbox. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Something we're going to have to get into very, very soon here.  Yeah.  But Ant's got a great idea because, yeah, and Taliban.  Taliban.  The Taliban have left.  So, Kabul, people are shaving.  And we figured, why should it be any different here?  That's right.  So, the guys are shaving their beards.  Yeah.  In Kabul.  Yeah.  Celebrating the fact that the Taliban is no longer happening, really.  Right.  No longer in control.  They've lost all their power.  So, we figured we'd get into the spirit here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:12:30]  Yes.  Some patriotism and support.  And Anthony came up with a brilliant, brilliant idea.  A brilliant concept, my friend.  Why leave all the fun to the Afghani men in Kabul with their shavings?  Why can't we celebrate here in our own inimitable style?  Do I even have to say it now?  I think everyone out there knows what we're getting at.  I do believe we're going to be doing some beard shaving of our own.  Some beard shaving of our own.  Right, Anthony? 
[00:13:00]  The bearded oyster shaving.  So, basically, we're encouraging the ladies to start showing up tomorrow.  Ladies, please, come down tomorrow.  I think we should, this has to last a few days, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we'll start tomorrow.  Yeah.  But I think we shouldn't, it should be like our military campaign.  We shouldn't just go in and do this and peter out.  It should be a sustained campaign of support for the war effort, the Afghani people that support their newfound freedom from the Taliban. 
[00:13:30]  And, of course, our president, George W. Bush.  So, we will start tomorrow.  Shave your Bush for Bush.  Shave your Bush for Bush on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  In celebration of the Taliban fleeing Kabul and everyone getting rid of that hair that represented oppression.  Ladies, doesn't it represent oppression? 
[00:14:00]  Your sluts.  We're assuming too much here, Anthony.  You think the ladies would go for this idea?  Well, I guess the only way we could tell is by talking to a couple, I guess.  We would love the ladies to come down tomorrow and kick this off for us.  Our sustained campaign here, the O.N.A. Army.  Shave your Bush for Bush.  Fighting the good battle.  To support Bush.  To support America.  And support the freedom of expression that the people are now showing in Kabul, Afghanistan. 
[00:14:30]  Shaving off that unwanted oppressive hair.  Shave your Bush for Bush starts tomorrow on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yes.  How many ladies do you think would come down here to have that done, Anthony?  One.  One?  I mean, I'm hoping a lot.  Oh, my God, I'm hoping a lot, too.  I hope a lot.  You know, a lot of people have been asking, what the hell can I do to help?  Haven't they?  Well, ladies, this is your chance to help the cause.  Can we get buttons or something made where it said, I shade my Bush for Bush? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, my God, now you're talking.  I think this could be a huge campaign.  Won't that take a promotion budget or something?  Oh, yeah.  But I'm thinking T-shirts and coffee mugs and bumper stickers.  I shade my Bush for Bush, please.  The bumper stickers.  Yeah.  Show your support.  You know, this could backfire.  What if, like, a Stalker Patty or a Lady Di or a Marriott decides that they want to show their support for the country?  Look, Opie, there was a time in the past where... 
[00:15:30]  And look, Dan from Hoboken, I've got to interrupt you.  Yeah, yeah.  Right away, if you shave Stalker Patty's patch, I'm never listening to you guys again.  Look, you people, Dan, Opie, I'm ashamed.  You know, in the past, I might have thought the same.  I don't want to see Stalker Patty getting shaved.  I surely don't want to see the retarded Laverne and Shirley getting shaved.  But we have to put aside what we want for the best for our nation.  You're insane.  And it's like, yes, a symbol of national pride. 
[00:16:00]  You're being selfish.  This is not about us.  This isn't about the show.  This isn't about gorgeous girls coming in to be shaved.  This is about our country and celebrating the newfound freedom and freedom from oppression that those people have gone through.  Anthony, I have my own theory, though.  I do believe the hotter you are, the more patriotic you are.  I will agree with you on that.  It's just a feeling I've had ever since I was a little boy.  But every little bit helps.  Dude, you don't see as well as I do, man. 
[00:16:30]  Let's not forget.  I see perfectly clear.  I had the LASIK surgery done on my eyes.  I see 2015.  Yeah.  Thank you, Dr. Philotoff and Diamond Vision.  I see perfectly.  And I just want to see the support and outpouring for our nation, our president, and the struggle that goes on in Afghanistan.  Will this be a one-day campaign?  The shave your bush for bush?  Or should we continue next week?  Opie, this could take years.  The shave your bush is what I'm thinking and cost thousands of innocent lives. 
[00:17:00]  We don't know how long this is going to take.  I'm not putting a time schedule on this.  Whenever we see oppression, we must bring out ladies.  Now, Anthony, why aren't the phones ringing with ladies that are willing to do this?  I don't know.  I'm looking.  I'm going to have to hang up on a bunch of people here.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  We've got to clear some of the lines.  I'm hanging up on a lot of people if I hang up on you. 
[00:17:30]  Don't worry.  We'll get to the cherry darts in a minute here.  Has a horrible poem about cleanest girl.  Fred.  Yo.  What's up, bro?  Listen, if you're going to be shaving bushes for bush, you might as well have the girl come in with the cleaners.  Oh, stop it.  That has nothing to do with it.  I told, I guess it was Stinky who answered.  Yeah.  That, you know, I heard a great limerick that ties directly into this girl with the cleaners.  All right, let's hear it.  Real fact.  It goes like this.  It goes, there once was a girl from Wake Forest who had a gigantic, it rhymes with Dolores. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Okay, most people you see thought her name was Marie, but her friends, they all knew her as Horace.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, my God.  That was horrible, Stinky.  That was so awful.  Anything with Horace in it.  No one's named Horace.  What is that?  That must have been funny in the 30s.  It's one of that old person's names that you just don't use anymore. 
[00:18:30]  Horace.  Ugh.  TJ, what's going on?  Hey, I got to say, that last guy was a dick.  Awful.  I just wanted to say that the chicks from Afghanistan are going to be terrible wow candidates, man.  Why's that?  Because I don't even think they're allowed to wear bras, man.  You're just going to see a whole lot of sand in socks, if you know what I mean.  Well, hopefully, some of the younger ones are still a little perky.  And now, this new freedom they have, they can just take it all off.  Nice. 
[00:19:00]  All right, I got to go to Mary.  She's a little pissed at us.  Thanks, TJ.  Mary, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  I just wanted to know, I would do it, but weren't you just bashing the girls from New York saying that we let you down and you picked strippers for this cherry thing?  Oh, yeah, you make a good point, sure.  So, if you want my bush, you can have it.  Are you going to come down tomorrow?  I will, if you want me there.  Oh, we absolutely do.  Shave your bush for bush.  Mary is our first lady to come forward.  All right, guys.  Show the support for America. 
[00:19:30]  Patriotic music.  Well, I'm going to wear one of those big Uncle Sam red, white, and blue hats tomorrow.  Are you?  Yes, to show my support.  Oh, my God, you walk in loud.  I'll wear fatigues.  Are you going to wear army fatigues?  Let's see, this is bordering on wacky radio stuff that you and I don't really like to do.  Hey, bush for bush.  Save your bush for bush.  All right, Mary, we'll see you tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right, hold on the line.  We're not kidding.  Okay.  I think the most patriotic girl would be the one who has the most to lose. 
[00:20:00]  You know what I mean?  Like the one that leaves the most on the floor, let's say.  Oof.  What do you say we have a prize?  We could have a side contest going, sure.  For the most, how would we do it?  Weigh it?  Yeah.  We'll get one of those pot scales or something.  We'll get like a Coke scale.  A Coke scale.  And weigh the amount.  And what kind of prize can we give a girl that shows she's more patriotic than any of the other girls?  Well, we have a lot of stuff in our prize closet.  DVD players.  We got, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  So, because we've got to get a little incentive for the ladies, Opie.  While the patriotism might not just be.  This bit is developing as we speak.  I kind of like the idea that I want to see a goddamn Bigfoot come in here.  Well, so far, one lady will show up tomorrow.  Yeah, very good.  Shave your bush for bush to show your support for America.  Yes, and the newfound freedom in Afghanistan to shave your bodies hair.  The Afghanis are shaving their beards, and we're going to do some beard shaving ourselves.  Right.  We need a couple of barbers. 
[00:21:00]  Do they call them barbers?  Barbers?  What do they call them?  We should have some ladies down here that know how to wax and stuff.  Don't they have some company that does that?  What about the two ladies that waxed all the hair off Stalker Paddy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think we ought to have something like that.  So, if women want to get waxed, they could do it.  Although, then we can't weigh it, can we?  Huh?  Yeah, we can.  We'll just slop.  We'll figure it out.  Weigh the strips beforehand.  Anthony, I have a feeling it'll be very obvious who wins the contest.  Okay.  The side contest. 
[00:21:30]  Because it's not about the contest.  Right.  That's just a little extra incentive to get the ladies down here.  I want to see a girl that looks like Osama Bin Laden eating a London broil when she walks in here.  That's what I want to see.  Or Osama Bin Laden with those old, remember you used to go in the store and buy those old wax lips?  Looks like he's wearing those big wax lips.  That's a winner.  That's classic.  Why not?  Let's go to Liza.  Liza, what's up?  Well, you guys were talking about the waxers. 
[00:22:00]  It's the Jay sisters that come in.  They are famous for like their Brazilians and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  The Brazilian wax.  Where they wax all the way behind and everything.  Yeah, they get everywhere.  Yeah.  But they do shapes and stuff, so maybe I can get like an American flag or something.  You know, that's all cute and stuff, and I enjoy that stuff, but I mean, it's not about us this time around.  Yeah, we just want to totally remove it.  Yeah, you've got to show your full support starting tomorrow.  Yeah, but what if you don't have that much to work with and, you know, to start off with? 
[00:22:30]  That's okay.  That's fine.  If you're a 5 o'clock shadow, that's okay.  We don't care if you have the Fred Flintstone mouth working.  That's right.  Can you guys do it next week because I have to work tomorrow?  Oh, you've got to take off.  You know what?  This is going to be an ongoing campaign, though.  Okay, because I really need to.  We're going for the big push tomorrow, but we will continue next week.  Okay.  I'd really like to pledge my support.  All right, Liza, hold on, because we're going to get your info.  You're not backing out on us, okay?  I won't.  All right.  We've got to make the ladies feel a little more guilty, so they call up and do this for us. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, this is for your country, ladies.  You said country, right?  Country.  I'm just asking.  You said country.  Country.  Yes, please.  I don't know what you even thought I said.  And what a fine country.  It certainly is.  We have.  And they're doing this for their country and country far away.  All kinds of countries.  Like a U.S. over there.  Right.  It is. 
[00:23:30]  It's an alliance.  It's a coalition of countries.  Are there any ugly countries out there?  Some countries are very ugly.  Really?  Yeah.  An example of an ugly country.  Ah, one that's not developed very well.  A lot of overgrowth, maybe.  You know, hasn't seen machinery that can really take down the brambles and brush.  Very clear it out.  Very dry and dusty.  Dry and arid.  With like tumbleweeds rolling across. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Kind of like in Iraq would be an ugly country, right?  Ugly country.  Anywhere in northern Africa, the deserts.  Stuff like that.  What about like Somalia?  Somalia, very ugly.  Ugly country?  Yeah, nothing but brambles there and it just stinks like dead people because people are  dying all the time.  Right.  They don't want it to stink.  Stagnant pools of water.  Ugh.  I do believe America has the best country.  The best country ever.  And we're going to prove that with the ladies that come in. 
[00:24:30]  Beautiful.  Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed as the twilight's  last gleaming. 
[00:25:00]  Vaginas.  Sproul Strikes.  Huzzah.  And bruh.  Huzzah.  Uh, Danny, what's going on?  It's Andy, what's up, boss?  Hey, man.  What do you got today?  Listen, if I bring down the shirts, do I get to come hang out?  You can make shirts for the ladies that get this done?  Yeah, my old man's got a business.  Oh.  Should we get shirts printed in?  I think we should.  I shaved my bush for bush?  Yeah.  Can you get like a little American flag on there and maybe Opie and Anthony or something? 
[00:25:30]  So far, I'll put on whatever you want on it.  All right, hold on to the line, man.  We'll take you up on that.  Thanks, buddy.  Can I give a shout out?  We have no money for this little promotion we're doing.  We're broke.  That's all right.  Can I give a shout out?  Yeah, go ahead.  Shout out.  802 Teamsters.  What's up, boys?  All right, cool, bro.  Puss-a!  Thank you.  Puss-a!  Puss-a!  All right, Danny, we'll supply the shirts for our big cause.  Yeah.  I feel better about what we're doing now because this is something that's going to help.  Shave your bush for bush starts tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:26:00]  We have two ladies that have called thus far.  Yeah.  Thus far.  I'm sure more will call up.  All right, Dan, we got to take a break?  All right.  We have to talk about Flight 587 a little bit.  Yeah.  Something new to be afraid of when you fly.  Yeah, I love when they have brand new disasters that have never really happened before.  Just something else to worry about as you're sitting there waiting to take off, Anthony.  Someone screwed up.  We'll get into that.  And, of course, people are starting to show up for the cherry darts for the Xbox competition  that will be going down a little later. 
[00:26:30]  That's going on today.  Nice.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys may be blow chucks.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  What a couple of ass wipes.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  I love it.  We love it.  Thank you, by the way.  I got to say thank you to Sam Adams for sending us our latest shipment of beer. 
[00:27:00]  We have no room in our office.  I believe they rolled it out of the back of a C-130 that was flying over the city  and parachuted it on three large canopies right down to the roof of the building.  We took it in.  Let's just put it this way.  I sit pretty much right next to Anthony in our office.  Yeah.  We all have this huge office we share.  I can't see him.  No.  The cases are piled up everywhere.  A lovely Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  We got the lager.  We got the Oktoberfest.  We got the Christmas thing, too.  We got the, yeah, the winter brew stuff.

Got four right in front of me.  Nice.  Our contestants are showing up for the cherry darts for the Xbox competition that will start soon, Anthony.  The stoner chick's out there.  We're going to get her in in a few minutes.  Yeah, she was peeking in the door going.  Camille, what's going on? 
[00:28:30]  Nothing.  How are you?  Real good.  What can we do for you, Camille?  I want to be in your Shave My Bush contest.  Oh.  Well, it's not really.  Well, yeah, there's a little contest going on.  A little competition.  Yeah.  Basically, it's Shave Your Bush for Bush to show your support for America.  I mean, hell.  You know, the Afghanis, they're shaving their beards.  We figured the least we could do is some beard shaving here.  Right.  Small sacrifice.  Here in America.  It's kind of like you're bonding with the people over there. 
[00:29:00]  Their newfound freedom from oppression.  And it's that oppressive hair.  And we have to say this carefully.  The lady that ends up shaving the most, yeah.  In the next few days, we'll win a fine prize from the Opie and Anthony program.  Who leaves the most scraps on the floor?  So, you're going to come down tomorrow, Camille?  Yeah.  We need girls to come down tomorrow to get this thing kicked off.  And then we'll extend it into next week as well, okay?  Good.  I'm excited.  How are you doing down there? 
[00:29:30]  Arid desert or Brazilian rainforest?  A little in between both of them.  Oh, okay.  It's like a little furry animal.  Oh, that's nice.  Look at that.  I like that.  Yeah.  Cute.  All right.  Does Stinky get your info?  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you, Camille.  We'll see you tomorrow.  All right.  Great.  Thanks.  Bye.  Someone will call you and give you directions and all that, all right?  Okay.  Good.  All right.  We're going to talk to a lot of ladies that are coming down tomorrow, but ladies, just  show up tomorrow.  Just show up.  You will be cordially invited in. 
[00:30:00]  That's right.  Tracy, you're next.  What's up?  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  You're from Canada, eh?  Yeah, eh?  Oh, Canada.  I'm in town doing a modeling job and wanted to throw in international support for your cause.  Oh, you're modeling?  I just heard model.  And international support.  You are so in.  I hope you're not.  You're not the girl that has the word before written under you, are you?  No.  I'm the after.  You're the after girl?  Yeah.  What do you model? 
[00:30:30]  Um, actually, I'm down doing a lipstick, I guess a lipstick advertisement for L'Oreal.  For L'Oreal.  So you're pretty face.  Have you done any body modeling?  Um, I've done body doubling nude in movies.  I've done laundry.  Who did you body double for?  Um, my best friend, Fawn McLaren.  She was in the cover girl murders.  I was her naked twin.  You were worried.  Yes, I was.  Oh, wow.  But unfortunately, there's not much to save. 
[00:31:00]  I only have a little shadow.  Uh, you know something?  Every little bit helps the cause.  That's right.  We gotta show our patriotism.  Shave your bush for bush.  That's great.  But you're from Canada, so we're only gonna shave 60, 60% of your bush.  Right, right.  Oh, exactly.  Thank you.  It's devaluing.  I'm sorry.  I can bring home the t-shirt to my dad.  I'm sure he'll be true.  Are we gonna get the t-shirts?  Is that guy for real?  We have to have t-shirts.  He's gonna call me as soon as he gets everything straightened out.  We need someone to come up with a quick design that looks kind of cool.  I already came up with one.  Or at least a really nice pair of G-Stray underwear to cover up my new haircut. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Very nice.  All right.  Tracy, you're just gonna show up tomorrow, right?  Yes, I will.  And you gave Stinky your info so we can make sure you're showing up tomorrow?  Yeah, I did.  I did.  All right, Tracy.  Thank you.  All right.  See you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  God bless our brothers and sisters to the north, Opie.  Canadian Tracy.  That's wonderful.  International support, Anthony.  Scrape off that make-believe she's got down on me.  Yeah, I like that.  I like that.  We're looking for a lot of international support, matter of fact.  We're building our own coalition. 
[00:32:00]  I know there's...  A multinational coalition.  I know there's plenty of ladies in the New York area that are from other countries,  and they happen to be in the area.  Show your support for America and the cause.  Right.  Shave your bush for bush starts tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  You see how happy it made the Afghani men when they were shaving themselves?  They're all laughing.  That they didn't have to sport all that nasty hair anymore because the Taliban has run off.  They're free to do whatever.  We want to do the same for you ladies.  Get rid of that nasty, oppressive, nappy hair. 
[00:32:30]  I want to talk to Robert Wagner, but you have to put him on hold.  Thank you.  Robert Wagner.  Robert.  Yes.  What happened to Natalie Wood?  Ah, she don't float.  That wood don't float.  So you're a barber?  Yes, Dr. E.  Yeah, I own Rockabilly Barbers in East Northport in Huntington.  Rockabillies?  Barbers.  We know, I know Joey Gruen. 
[00:33:00]  I used to do a bunch of the Rotgut Boys hair.  That's not mine.  Yeah.  Who's this?  This is Anthony?  Yeah, he did.  All right.  Joe used to come in and one of the guys who used to live on town line.  All right.  All right.  Do we need another barber tomorrow?  No.  Are you positive?  Yeah.  No.  All right.  Robert, I'm sorry.  We got enough barbers.  All right, man.  We're actually getting ladies that can wax and stuff, so we do this professionally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  What's that?  Thank you, Robert. 
[00:33:30]  All right.  Can we, hmm, that's a good idea, collect up all of the scraps we get and send it off  to Afghanistan to show us some more.  Wouldn't they love it?  Go on.  They'd love something like that.  All right.  Scraps from the U.S.  Well, we got to get through today's show before we start the Shave Your Bush campaign that  we'll start tomorrow.  Cherry darts.  Cherry darts for the Xbox is happening today.  Most of our contestants have arrived. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, we got to talk about the exorcism, too?  Oh.  It's good stuff.  Oh, we got to talk about the plane.  We got that.  The exorcism.  We got audio of that guy, because I thought the singer from Disturbed was having an exorcism  done.  Well, how about we do this?  Get the stoner girl in.  And while we're getting the stoner girl in, quickly, we got to talk about Flight 587.  Yes.  Something to worry about the next time you fly.  Well, this seems to be a screw-up.  Seems to be a little bit of a screw-up as far as keeping the planes away from each other. 
[00:34:30]  We had one of those Japanese planes taking off.  A 747.  Took off.  And I just got distracted.  I'm sorry.  Hold on, stoner chick.  Someone on the phone lines is going to make you laugh really hard.  Kenny, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  What's up, man?  Say what you want to say.  I'm trying to tell you guys.  You guys should save up all that hair you get for shaving Bush for Bush and make a wig  for O&A.  Ah, so you blew your line.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  No, you blew. 
[00:35:00]  A wig for Patty, he had said originally.  It was typed out on the screen, and he blew his line.  He blew his big chance on the O.P. and Anthony show.  His big chance.  Basically, he wants us to collect all the hair and make a wig for stalker Patty.  Yeah.  Hell, that's funny.  I can't wait to see some good old-fashioned Canadian beaver pelt.  It's been so long since I've seen one of those in a trap.  And the girl's not shy to be naked, Anthony.  She's a body double.  Oh, yeah, make a big Davy Crockett hat out of it. 
[00:35:30]  That'll be nice, right?  I'm beaver hunting.  Yeah, so this Japanese 747 takes off from Kennedy.  And then the Airbus 300 takes off after it.  And there was enough time.  It was supposed to be like two and a half minutes or something between planes taking off  so they don't interfere because those big 747 engines kind of screw up the air a little bit.  But they take a lot longer to climb, the 747.  So the Airbus, it's lighter and faster, climbing out, caught up to the 747 
[00:36:00]  and got like a little too close.  And the turbulence out of the engine ripped the rear tail fin off, the vertical fin.  Now, did you know this was possible before today?  I knew about, like, wake turbulence.  I didn't know it would shred your airplane.  So what, the wake turbulence?  Yeah, kind of shook the tail enough where it ripped off.  It's called it flutter.  It called it flutter.  So that rips off.  And once that's gone, forget it.  There's no control of your plane. 
[00:36:30]  That's vital control.  What about the engines separating?  They said the engines were still on and running when the plane lost control.  So the only thing that could knock the engines off  was the plane went so out of control that it just flung one way or another  and the G-forces of being out of control like that ripped the engines off.  So it shook the engines loose.  Yeah.  That's it.  That seems to be what happened.  God damn Japs got us again.  Damn it. 
[00:37:00]  Sorry, I don't look in the rearview mirror.  So that seems to be what happened.  No terrorism.  Man, it's easy to make a stoner chick laugh.  Death and destruction.  We should have you around all the time.  Look how easy our show is.  I'm not even stoned.  You're not even stoned?  You're not stoned?  I wish I was.  You didn't go to the stairwell yet?  No.  Yeah, you'll have to go there.  That's pretty good.  So you're pretty hot for a stoner chick.  Oh, thank you.  No, stoner chicks are pretty hot, though.  Stoner chicks are cool.  Yeah.  You party with them and stuff.  Look at her go. 
[00:37:30]  So why aren't you stoned?  I'm, like, driving into the city from Rockland, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, but what can happen?  Driving while stoned, nothing ever happens to you.  I know.  You wish something would happen, but.  Like Bill Hicks says, you get in a car accident going, what, four miles an hour.  Yeah, no one's going to do.  What damage can you do going that slow?  No one's going to get hurt.  That's fine.  So what do you think about your chances of winning the Xbox today?  These losers don't stand a chance.  Whoa.  They don't stand a chance. 
[00:38:00]  You think you could lob that cherry right into what we're targeting?  Where is the target?  Well, the target hasn't arrived yet.  The target isn't here yet.  The target will get here.  The target will be here soon.  And, yeah, you think that won't distract you or anything?  No.  No.  Are you sure?  No.  I'm pretty much on point.  I'm going to throw it, and I'm going to get it, and I'm going to win an Xbox.  It's my boyfriend's loser.  That's right.  He's a loser.  All right.  Her boyfriend was the loser.  Lives at home.  Does he know about this? 
[00:38:30]  Does he know you're done?  Yeah, he knows.  What did he say?  You know.  He's worried.  Is he?  Why?  Why is he worried?  He thinks I'm going to do something crazy, you know?  Well, she did admit on the air yesterday you wouldn't mind getting on the lesbian couch.  What's wrong?  You said it yesterday to a million people.  She freaked like, why are you saying that?  Oh, my God.  I can't wait for her sorrow. 
[00:39:00]  It's all right.  She's got a pierced tongue, too.  Oh, no.  Check it out.  They say, yeah.  Yeah.  It's shaking.  Why are you shaking?  Your tongue is shaking.  Don't be nervous.  We don't bite.  We don't bite when you're here.  We'd give you a beer, but you're underage, right?  Yeah.  Oh, what a bummer.  You want some heroin, though?  I don't believe it.  I like to shoot in my toenail with bamboo shoots.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah? 
[00:39:30]  All right, stoner chick.  There she is.  Good luck to you.  Thank you.  All right.  Yes.  Me?  Who?  Me?  Me?  Me?  Me?  Shelly, what's up?  Hey, I want to save my bush for a bush.  Well, all you have to do is show up tomorrow.  All right.  Well, you got to tell me where I got to go.  All right.  Hold on.  Awesome.  The girls are coming out of the woodwork for this.  Yeah.  I knew the patriotism would come out.  Do you want to do it for patriotism?  Maybe.  Maybe?  I have to see if my boss will be cool enough to let me go another day. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, we might be able to start a day early.  Come ahead.  Yeah.  Kind of kick it off.  We can kick it off today, officially.  Earl's got the Mach 3.  He does have the Mach 3.  No, I'm pretty clean cut, so.  Oh, are you?  You like keeping it like that anyway?  Yeah, no.  I'm kind of the whole afro.  That's good.  Yeah, you know, I'm a big mess.  It's pretty tall.  Big mess.  All right.  Padding.  Well, we got to take a break, and we'll talk to some more of our contestants that will  be throwing the cherry darts for the Xbox, Anthony. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  After we take a quick break, and we'll get to the exorcism guy.  That's some really good audio.  Yeah, this guy, you know something?  He's just your run-of-the-mill kook, and the people that were giving him the exorcism,  just as crazy as him.  Religious nuts.  Wait until you hear the audio.  Okay.

I mean, it's nice to talk to the ladies, but just show up tomorrow.  Open door tomorrow for the ladies.  Yeah, let's kick this thing off.  All right.  So that's tomorrow.  Cherry darks for the Xbox.  That's going to get underway shortly.  We're waiting for some of the contestants to show up and we'll get the festivities rolling,  okay?  Has the Target arrived yet?  Well, we need the Target as well. 
[00:43:00]  That's right.  From Privileged Gentleman's Club.  Target should be here within the next 15, 20 years.  Privileged supplying the Target.  That's wonderful.  Actually, they're bringing multiple targets.  Multiple targets.  All right.  That rocks.  Pick your best target.  All right.  We want to talk about the exorcism clips for a few minutes.  Oh, yeah.  And then we'll finally get into the cherry darts for the Xbox.  This was great.  Who is it?  Russell is this possessed guy.  It was on Dateline.  And they actually filmed the exorcism. 
[00:43:30]  Here's this one guy, this Russell guy.  I don't know.  How old did he seem to be?  About 50.  Yeah.  And then all these Jesus freak type nut jobs around him.  Giving him this exorcism.  He's sitting around just going,  Like freaking out.  Not demonic.  Not like possession or head spinning or voices or anything. 
[00:44:00]  Just a crazy guy.  The guy's just a kook is what he is.  Off his medication.  Just a nut.  And all these people, they all have that lost, frigging religious kook look in their eyes.  You ever see the ads on TV for those religious albums?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's like, Oh, my God is an awesome God.  And it shows like people in these huge coliseums and arenas.  And they've all got their hands in the air.  And some of them have their eyes closed. 
[00:44:30]  And they're singing.  And the ones that have their eyes open, you look in there, nothing.  Nothing.  Well, they're searching for something in their lives, Anthony.  Yeah.  The only reason they're there is because they're either kooks.  I mean, I'm not saying anybody who's into religion or a faith in God is a kook.  That's not.  No.  These people go to church, do whatever you want.  When you gather in these large congregations of these religious fanatics, they're kooks.  How about the snake worshippers?  They're the same thing. 
[00:45:00]  They're the same thing.  They're equally as kooky, just doing different things.  They play with the snakes.  And if the snake bites them, well, that's God's will.  Yeah.  And you die.  Yeah.  Poisonous snakes.  They believe that.  And they all take their turns dancing with the snake in front of the congregation.  Show their faith.  To show the faith.  And a place like Madison Square Garden or a ballpark is just full of people that are waving their hands.  And they got that look.  And I look in their eyes and they're singing.  They got those big dopey smiles. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, my God is an awesome God.  And they're clapping.  Yeah.  And they got that dead stare.  These people doing the exorcism, the same thing.  There was a woman.  And when the exorcist was finally over, the exorcism, and they thought they rid the evil spirit of this guy, she's looking at the guy and has that same dead look in her face.  She's got this smile.  She's like, oh, just praise Jesus.  Just praise Jesus.  She's like, what? 
[00:46:00]  No, this guy's a nut.  And you're a nut.  Trying to make you think you're doing an exorcism.  I saw no evil there.  I just saw a kooky guy.  Look at some.  Listen to some of the clips.  Yeah, let's start with the face of evil.  The face of evil.  Yeah, listen to that.  All right.  And so what we are now looking at, according to the group, is the face of evil.

[00:51:00]  All right, the next exorcism clip from Dateline last night is Lucifer, Ed.  Lucifer.  Ooh, very ominous.  The exorcism continues, and one hour in, something appears to change.  Lucifer, I presume.  Would you like to hear what the Bible has to say about you?  Just 20 seconds after being called Lucifer, Russell responds. 
[00:51:30]  You are the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.  Do you know who the only seed of a woman is?  No!  Ow!  Yeah!  Oh, ow!  Ow!  You're not hurting.  You leave without hurting him.  Ow!  Get out.  You leave without hurting him.  The Lord rebukes you.  The Lord rebukes you.  You're not going to embarrass me. 
[00:52:00]  Get out.  Lucifer, this guy.  Eh, eh, eh.  That is crazy people.  That is a room full of crazy people.  Oh, they're enjoying themselves.  You leave without hurting him.  Right.  Lucifer, I presume, he says.  Oh, yeah, you got me.  Yeah, Lucifer, it's me.  The next clip is Jesus is Lord attack.  Jesus is Lord attack.  In Jesus' name, you tell me, why do you torment Russell?  Gee, in accent. 
[00:52:30]  Jesus Christ has dominion over all of his creation.  Do you know?  The Lord rebuke you.  Yes, I do know.  Get out.  Hello, everybody.  I didn't ask her.  We asked you, foul spirit.  Foul spirit.  You say it.  In Jesus' name, you say it.  Get out.  You let him go.  The Lord rebuke you.  The Lord rebuke you.  Let him go.  And even in your rebellion, he uses you for his purposes.  Not this one.  Yes, this one.  I put you before the truth, and I shine the truth of the word of God upon you. 
[00:53:00]  The bottom line is this, foul spirit.  Jesus Christ is Lord, and you're not.  And you're not.  Oh, you pissed me off.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  Ooh.  That is the lamest.  The next clip is Summon Jesus. 
[00:53:30]  Get out, foul spirit.  Arr, arr, arr, arr.  Summon Jesus.  We ask the Lord Jesus himself to come.  Lord, this stubborn spirit.  Resist our efforts, but he cannot resist yours.  The room grows quiet.  Yeah.  Baby, it's gone.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Is he gone?  I don't think so, no.  Ugh. 
[00:54:00]  And finally, five hours later, Ant, the last clip we have for the exorcism.  Boop.  You sound like Brewer doing the whooping, uh, boop.  Whooping monkeys.  Boop.  Someone's calling us an a-hole.  Larry.  Yo, what's up, O?  Hey.  What's happening?  Hey, man, I gotta tell you, I've been to a couple of these retreats.  We're not all nuts, man.  Now, let me tell you, there's some effin' nuts out there.  But don't give us a bad rap.  I love Jesus.  I'm not a nut.  I love Jesus, too.  Oh, fuck, you got a problem with that? 
[00:54:30]  I got a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  Okay?  Oh, Larry, you want to listen closely.  We said not all people, but there are a lot of cooks out there.  Well, you said all the people at the large congregations were.  Right.  I've been there.  When you're in a huge ballpark and, uh, you're singing along with, uh, some preacher at a huge, uh, arena.  Yeah, you're a cook.  You're a cook, you ass, an a-hole.  Except Jesus Christ.  Oh!  What, because I love him like that? 
[00:55:00]  Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.  I got crushed in my life.  It don't rhyme, but it's the truth.  Oh!  All right, Larry.  Later, man.  Let us goof, man.  Whatever.  You're an a-hole.  You suck.  Jeez, how about forgiveness, Dale, Larry?  Isn't that what they taught you in that arena?  You're supposed to forgive, my friend.  Uh, five hours later, Anthony.  Five hours later.  The last clip we have.  Then, nearly five hours after the group began its attack on what they believe to be evil demons inhabiting Russell, 
[00:55:30]  evil eeks out the words they have been urging him to say.  Ow!  Jesus, we can't believe it.  I'm so sorry.  Jesus is Lord.  Lord.  Get out.  Confession, Father.  You've heard of confession.  You've loosened me.  You've heard of Jesus.  So, like, chunk is Lord.  You've heard it.  And you get out.  Jesus is Lord.  You get out.  You get out.  You go.  You go. 
[00:56:00]  You get out.  Jesus Christ.  Oh.  Is this guy being forced to lick the cleanest?  No!  No!  Listen up.  Russell Gags, spitting into a garbage pail.  Spit the devil out.  He threw up the devil.  He threw him up.  Hold on.  What a pussy devil.  This is my cross. 
[00:56:30]  This is my cross.  This is my cross.  This is my cross.  This is my cross.  This is my cross.  This is my cross.  Syrup of Epicax.  All you need.  This is my cross.  This is my cross.  Try it.  Keep saying it.  This is my cross.  This is my cross.  The team relishes this moment.  Their hard work, they believe, has paid off.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ghostbusters!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's simply saying that.  Oh, they're all happy now.  It's tough.  Hey, let's all go get some ice cream.  Let's go free.  Oh, I'm free.  You hear the woman? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, praise the Lord.  Oh, free.  Let's go to Denny's.  Now, you say praise Jesus and spit up into this garbage pail.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:57:30]  Listen to all of his voices.  I'm straight.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  How about a nice fucking egg?  This is something weird.  I don't play it.  I don't.  I don't.  I don't see it.  Dog growth busters.  Boom.  That's probably a lot more realistic than this goddamn egg.  Exorcism.  I ain't freezing no food.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow. 
[00:58:00]  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  from Boston is saying, I didn't know Shemp was possessed. 
[00:58:30]  Just who you're going to call Ghostbusters?  See, if he would have done that, if Russell would have done a scream like that,  and like white smoke came out of his mouth, and they all started choking,  it took five hours, all of a sudden, ah, ah, Lucifer's a pussy, and it was Lucifer.  It wasn't even some little piddly crap devil, demon guy. 
[00:59:00]  It was Lucifer, one of the head muckety-mucks down there.  And it took five hours for these clowns sitting around a room to chase him out.  Rich on the phone says, hey, it sounds like the new Slipknot album.  Be gone.  Unclean spirit.  Unclean spirit.  Ah-hert.  Then they're all, like, giggly at the end.  Oh, praise him!  Because they actually thought that they had scared away a demon.  And then, you know something?  Yeah, he wound up having a relapse after that. 
[00:59:30]  Of course.  You know why?  He's a mental case.  He's a nut.  All he needs is some Prozac.  The demon went out for a cigarette, Anthony.  That's what he did.  Yeah.  That's all.  He didn't want to listen to those kooks.  He went out for a cig, and he came back when they left.  And he didn't even have it.  He had that...  Hey, he didn't even have any of that good.  Your mother sucks group in hell.  Die, die.  Please tell me. 
[01:00:00]  Tell me why you leave me here.  Tell me.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  From The Exorcist.  That rock.  Die, die, die.  You know, that's good stuff.  Not...  Guy had a Tourette's fit.  It sounded just like the Tourette's Whorehouse bit.  All right. 
[01:00:30]  We'll waste another five minutes doing that.  It was nothing.  All right.  Are the contestants ready to go?  I hope so.  Is our target here?  Has the target arrived?  Targets have not been acquired as of yet.  All right.  Look. 
[01:01:00]  It's only 20 after four.  Chill out.  Find them.  All right.  We've got to get the cherry darts for the Xbox rocking and rolling next, okay?  Yeah.  We'll talk to some of the contestants.  Also, ladies, don't forget, tomorrow starts our new campaign, Shave Your Bush for Bush.  Oh, yeah.  To show your support for America, they're shaving their beards in Afghanistan, and we  will be shaving some beards of our own starting tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ladies, all you have to do is show up.  We have at least 10 ladies coming down tomorrow already.  All right?  Nice.  We have T-shirts and all sorts of fun.  And a little side thing going on, the lady that shaves the most will win a fine prize 
[01:01:30]  from the Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah, whoever leaves the most scraps.  Okay?  Yeah.  As we go to break, Anthony, something from the archives.  Dice finds God.  Oh, right.  I love this little thing.  Check this out.  Mario.  What's up, gentlemen?  How are you, Mario?  Yeah, you know what I learned today?  Yeah.  I learned that Dice is one step closer to finding God.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  Oh, no.  If that ever happened.  Maybe he'll call the new album that or something.  You know what I mean?  That's the next step.  Could you see Dice doing that? 
[01:02:00]  So, I got to tell you about my new personal relationship with Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.  Yeah, I got to change the back of my jacket because I'm now a disciple of Jesus.  You hear me?  And you'll hear the words of Christ.  Yeah.  You know, would that just be too much?  That would be something I would check out if he decided to be like, you know, a minister or something.  I'd go to church every Sunday to hear that.  Jesus walked around healing people, wearing a loincloth, so the lepers wouldn't have to look at his yambang. 
[01:02:30]  Okay?  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  So, he's walking around.  He sees a leper, you know, and they're like, oh, Jesus, could you cure me?  Yeah, sure.  Slap the nose back on your face.  I'll wave my hand.  You'll be okay.  Hey! 
[01:03:00]  Praise the Lord.  Now, the Lord is our Savior.  I went through a period of my life where I was doing things that maybe the Lord didn't like.  You hear me?  But Jesus is over here now.  Okay?  In my heart.  Jesus is over here now.  It just won't work, man.  And the Lord sayeth to you, stop your evil ways.  Over here.  Over here.  Okay?  I'm over here now. 
[01:03:30]  My disciple, Club Shutter Kenny, come here.  I found Jesus Christ.  I walk with the Lord now.  Jesus Christ, he's over here now.  He's over here.  In Dice's heart.  Dice would like the Virgin Mary, that's for sure, huh?  Hey, I'm a man of God now.  Yeah.  I can't be saying things about the Virgin Mary.  No, of course not.  You know, I would have liked to slip her a nice one in the old days. 
[01:04:00]  Because she is a virgin.  Oh!  It was Immaculate Conception, Jesus, with Mary.  Mary never felt a yam bag on her ass.  Immaculate.  Oh, my God.  Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.  Now I found the words of Jesus.  Right.  Christ is my Savior.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:04:30]  No more with the hairy banana.  Now it's a cross.  I do my work with a cross.  I'm touring the country, spreading the word of God.  Could you see that?  Oh, my God.  That would be too friggin' surreal.  Yeah, Jesus is over here now.  Over here.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, Father, who art in heaven.  Oh!  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:05:00]  So, you know, in the old days, I might have talked about Moses going to the burning bush and added in something dirty.  But it's a beautiful thing.  I'm walking with Jesus.  You ever see that picture with the footprints in the sand?  Yeah, there's only one set of footprints.  And Jesus walking next to me during the times of my life.  And I said, hey, Jesus, how come during the toughest parts of my life, there's only one set of footprints? 
[01:05:30]  Why'd you leave me, you scumbag?  And he said, no, dice, that's when I carried you.  Right.  So I broke down crying in tears.  Yeah.  Let me read now from the book of dice.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You need a personal relationship with God.  We're all equal.  People, the chinks, the colored, the midgets, the whores.  We're all children of God over here. 
[01:06:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  Hallelujah.  And shut your ass.  Sorry, sorry.  Okay?  Okay.  You know, I don't want to be laying there dying over here.  Ha, ha, ha.  Before I find Jesus.  Before you find Jesus.  Right.  Because Satan does seem like a lot of fun.  I don't want to go through eternity with a pitchfork in my ass.  Okay?  Oh!  A dream, you know, bigger than selling out the garden. 
[01:06:30]  Uh-huh.  Would be Saint Dice.  Okay?  The patron saint of studded leather jackets.  Huh?  I'm over here now.  Where are you?  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Oh!  I'll be at Saint Whack Bag of Biscopal Church.  A clause from Laf Your Yam Bag Zoff. 
[01:07:00]  Get out of here, Rick.  Always over the top, Rick.  And stoner Matt from Bayonne, New Jersey.  I learned that in the world according to Dice,  everyone with bad karma is coming back as a midget with sausage-linked fingers.  But even the midgets are children of God.  See, what I was saying before was bad.  You think when midgets go to heaven, they get small little angel wings? 
[01:07:30]  Now, it's not funny.  It's really what I'm thinking.  Jesus, over here now.  I was over there.  Now I'm over here with the Lord.  Just remember the battle cry of the Lord.  Jesus is over here now.  Pull your pants down.  Can I see your taint whipped cream lesbian?  Can we see her, bud?  Let me tell you about my balloon nut.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Radio's own slaggy. 
[01:08:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Crystal Method, Anthony.  Name of the game.  Yeah.  Someone was making fun of me on the email because I said Crystal Method a lot.  Yeah.  I didn't say The Crystal Method.  Silly you.  And this a-hole says I sound uneducated by saying Crystal Method instead of The Crystal Method.  Uneducated.  All right.  The ladies are en route from Privileged Gentleman's Club, The Targets. 
[01:08:30]  Did we get a confirmation?  Yes.  Yes.  They're on their way, Ed.  Cherry darts for the Xbox.  Will happen very, very soon.  Good.  And we're not doing one of those radio tease things, if you remember.  We said we'd get the festivities rolling right around 5 o'clock, so we're on target.  Hey, Jennifer, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, how are you?  I'm pretty good.  What do you have?  How are you?  Yeah.  I'm on my way home from work. 
[01:09:00]  I'm an elementary school teacher.  Yeah.  And when I heard you talking to me before, it just made me think last-when I first started  my first year of school, I had a second grade class, and this kid, you know, kid's messed  up.  He was a big pain in the ass.  So I kept calling his mother, calling his mother.  I called her up one day, and she said, I'll be right up.  So I figured this is great.  She's finally going to get things taken care of.  And she comes up, comes running in my classroom with this huge cross.  It's like three foot long.  Gets right in the kid's face.  The kid gets knocked off his chair, and she's screaming, go, Satan, be gone, be gone. 
[01:09:30]  You've got four kids that are peeing in their pants.  Well, the whole class is crying.  Wait, the mom comes in with like a three-foot cross to do an exorcism right in the middle  of your classroom?  Right in the middle of the class.  That's crazy.  You know, the kids are peeing in their pants.  They're all ready to leave.  Right.  This woman's insane.  That's one of those moms that would kill the kids, you know.  That's by the demon.  I had to kill it.  Oh, well, I had to drown the bit.  I had to kill it.  You ever see them in prison when they talk to them, and they have the interview after 
[01:10:00]  they're arrested in prison?  Oh, no, I had to.  And he was possessed by Satan.  And they say it as calm as possible.  Yeah.  Oh, no, I had to go.  Man, why does that person live?  So what happened?  Did the kid fall over and stuff?  The kid was like laying on the ground, shaking.  And meanwhile, the rest of the class, you know, half the class is crying, and they're screaming.  So how do you handle this as a teacher?  Well, this was my second week teaching.  Right.  Like, it was my first job, second week teaching. 
[01:10:30]  I just stood there, first of all, like in awe, called my principal in.  My principal, you know, immediately called security guard in, removed the woman from the  classroom.  And then we sat down and had this nice conversation.  She's telling me so calmly, you know, well, he's possessed by the devil.  I don't know what to do.  You know, I've tried sprinkling him with holy water every night.  Yeah, that usually works.  And bringing him to church.  Yeah, really.  You know what?  Give him a little spank every now and then.  What do you think?  Yeah, knock the crap out.  Punish him. 
[01:11:00]  Exactly.  Jesus, I don't know why they don't have a problem with this duct tape.  Parents need to spank their kids again.  I think so.  We got whooped nice and good when we were growing up.  I remember getting sound thrashing occasionally.  The thing that worked good was either dad's belt.  That was always, yeah, that sucked, man.  And it was just like, the dumbest things.  First, he had the threat belt.  That was me and my brother maybe talking too loudly when we were supposed to be asleep for school the next day. 
[01:11:30]  And then, you know, there'd be the warnings from the living room.  Knock it off.  Shut up in there.  I'll come in there.  Don't make me get up.  Don't make me come in there.  Don't sleep.  It's supposed to be asleep.  What do you do?  Stop talking.  And then he would come in and hang his belt on the doorknob of the bedroom.  Oh, man.  It was like, clank.  And it would kind of like shake back and forth when he let it go.  And the light would glisten off of the belt buckle.  And you're like, all right, now we better shut up. 
[01:12:00]  Never got hit for that, though.  But, like, if I broke something around the house, because when I was a kid, seven, eight years old and whatnot, I would always take stuff apart.  If there was a clock sitting around, I'd take a butter knife and a nutcracker.  You want to see how it works, right?  And just start disassembling the clock.  And I'd never get it back together again.  I couldn't put it back together.  I'm seven.  I could take it apart.  I couldn't put it back together.  And my mom would be all upset that I took the clock apart. 
[01:12:30]  And Dad, of course, I had to get the whipping.  I had to get me my ass beat with a belt.  So it was, you know, get in the room.  Like, oh, God.  You're on the bed.  And then the belt comes out.  Whack!  Right across your ass.  You know something, though?  You just made me cringe when you said before, don't make me come over there.  I find myself saying that all the time now.  The kids at school.  You'll become your parents.  Your parents out there.  Don't make me come over there.  You guys that are parents and you women that are parents out there, you have become your parents. 
[01:13:00]  Believe me.  Oh, God.  You do the exact same things that you do.  You ever get spanked by the wooden spoon?  The wooden spoon was a good quick item around the kitchen.  I got hit once with a Hot Wheel track.  Oh, my God.  Those are the ones with the Hot Wheel tracks.  And let me tell you.  The orange Hot Wheel tracks.  Yeah, the orange Hot Wheel track.  Worse than the flat bottom part was the other part that left two razor sharp lines on your ass.  Because it had the little U shape to it, the track, to hold the Hot Wheel cars in. 
[01:13:30]  That track was like...  I'm swinging from it.  Coming over and beat our ass.  You can swing back to the kitchen.  My son of a bitch mom.  She wouldn't even hit me on the soft spot.  No.  You know, the butt.  Yeah.  She would make sure she got me right below the butt on the legs.  Oh, that hurts.  Oh, nice.  You know what happened to me once?  This was when mom had to take over the disciplinary duties because my father decided he wanted to play with horses out in California. 
[01:14:00]  So we're in...  Hey, God love him.  We...  I was doing something bad.  You talk to your dad these days?  Uh, no, he's, uh, he's dead, Opie.  He's been dead a while.  And...  Thanks.  We never got hit.  My brother...  Uncomfortable silence.  Gee, thanks, Opie.  I...  I...  I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  My mom had to take over disciplinary.  So she takes the belt one day.  And, uh, she...  She swings it over my ass.  She's never done this before.  She hits me too close to where her hand is. 
[01:14:30]  So the belt...  And I'm trying to, like, claw my way to the wall, uh, from...  On the bed so she can't, like, get me.  Uh, and...  And she hits me too close to her hand.  The belt whips around.  Hits me right on the tip of my small mule at the time.  I started screaming like that exorcism tape.  And...  And...  Yeah.  Boop!  Boop!  And shaking. 
[01:15:00]  I was shaking on the bed and screaming.  And is this, uh, the sound of you?  Oh, let me hear it.  Yeah, that was me when I got a hit.  That was the sound I made.  Boop!  Boop!  Boop!  And, uh, that was the last time she ever hit me.  She was like, oh, my God, I'm sorry.  She starts crying.  She thought she ruined me for life.  I had, like, a man-sized mule for a day.  My brother had the winning line.  Don't hit me or I'll call the hotline. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, well, this was before, uh, child abuse was fast.  There was no hotlines when we were growing up.  There was no one to call.  They, if you called anyone, they'd tell you, well, shut up and be good next time.  That's right.  Do what you're told, and it won't happen.  They'd probably come over and thank you.  Back in those days, I saw blatant child abuse right in the aisles of grocery stores.  I saw people pulling, uh, arms out of their child's socket or by the hair.  Mommy, I want this.  Mommy, I want this.  Mommy?  Mommy, I want this.  No, shut up.  You can't have it. 
[01:16:00]  Shut up.  And they would just tell kids, you know, shut up.  You're not getting it.  But, Mommy, I like it.  I need this, Mommy.  I need this.  Mommy, can I please have this, Mommy?  I need it.  Ah!  Oh, my God.  You won't.  And then they had to recite it to you.  Yeah, they had to recite it.  Don't think you will ever get that.  Hold on.  If you stop dying, I will just hit you even harder.  We're the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Anthony, you're missing one thing with that.  She would add extra syllables, though.  I know.  Hold on a minute.  Don't I will ca-er-ack you in the face.  Yeah, it's like, don't doesn't have three syllables.  All right, Jennifer, thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Good song.  Let's go to Keith. 
[01:17:00]  Keith, you're next on the Opie and Anthony program.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what we need is kids to start spanking again so they won't be acting up in class.  They'll just be kicking and hitting tollboots.  Yeah, you're right.  I don't have kids.  Do whatever the hell you want to.  Oh, I couldn't imagine.  Because you know something?  At some point, you've got to crack them one.  And I'm not, you know, what am I going to do?  Be a hypocrite.  I did the same thing.  All right, go ahead.  Be a criminal.  Brother Joe wants to talk about the bunk beds.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Our defensive bunker. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Brother Joe.  The defensive bunk bed.  Tell them about that one, man.  Yeah, we had bunk beds.  So whoever had the bottom bunk was the lucky son of a bitch.  And even the top bunk was kind of lucky.  It made it very difficult to be beaten.  If you were in the bottom bunk, dad would come in with the belt.  He couldn't get a good swing.  He'd have to use that sidearm pitch.  Oh, he'd have to do the Louis Tee on.  He'd do the Louis Tee on.  Look at me with a Boston reference today.  Hello, Boston. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, he'd have to crouch down and swing sidearm, and that didn't work.  And then if you were on the top bunk, you could roll all the way to the wall.  Now he's got to do this weird overhand, like a jump shot swing down thrashing.  That didn't work well either.  And that, I always liked having the bottom bunk, though, because occasionally you get  you with the tip of that belt on the top bunk.  But the bottom, you knew with the sidearm, he wasn't going to get a good swing on you.  I'm about defensive bunk. 
[01:18:30]  The defensive bunker.  It worked well.  In my house, when we acted up, we had to go into the backyard and find a stick.  Yeah, that's the cruelest little house on the prairie goddamn thing I have heard.  My dad would go, and my mom would be in the living room, and he'd go, go outside and get  a stick and make sure it's a big stick.  And then you'd have to go in the yard and, like, search out a stick.  You can't come back with a small one, because now he's going to get madder.  You don't want to abuse yourself and come back with a huge stick.  Oh, be honest.  It was just your family couldn't afford a belt. 
[01:19:00]  You know what's the best, dude?  When you used to get into a fight, like when we lived in CI and we would get into a fight,  and you would be losing the fight miserably.  Yeah.  I mean, this kid's just pummeling me.  And the old man is standing there watching, going, keep fighting him, keep fighting him.  And you're losing miserably.  You had one of those old men?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Had the hell beat out of me.  And then when I'm done and I was beaten down to the ground by this kid, the old man, I get up, 
[01:19:30]  I start walking inside, and he goes, don't you walk inside, go back and fight him again.  And he would whack me in the head.  And make you chase after the guy that just kicked your ass to go get some more.  He just makes it, yeah, yeah.  Man.  Oh, my God, I forgot about that.  Every neighborhood had the one father or the mother in some cases that would, yeah,  would encourage their kids to fight the bullies and stuff.  Dude, I was coming home from Fleet's Cove Beach once in the middle of the summer there in Centiport, Anthony. 
[01:20:00]  Lovely Centiport, Long Island.  And the car in front of me, the person will remain nameless, but the mom was driving the car,  and there was a kid walking alongside the car that gave this kid some problems at the beach that day.  Mom stops the car and says, get out there and beat the crap out of him.  He stops the car in the middle of the road, the kid jumps out, and there's a huge fight on the side of the road.  We're behind the car going, what the eff are we going to do?  It's like you're a little hit squad, and they're the boss.  You know, they're the crime boss.  You've got to go out there and make the hit, or else it's going to be your ass. 
[01:20:30]  That's what happens.  All right, Brother Joe.  We're on our way in, fellas.  All right, man.  Oh, you're coming in for the festivities, huh?  Yeah, we'll see you in a few.  Who isn't, right?  All right, man.  All right, bye.  Yeah, boy, God.  You know, and it just goes to show, it doesn't matter how the hell you brought up.  You know, I should be in a goddamn institution.  And then someone like Opie should be in an institution.  What?  I understand my problem.  But, you know, who is to say what's right or wrong?  I confessed my problems yesterday. 
[01:21:00]  As far as...  And I'm doing much better today.  Know what I did?  I bought the best MetroCard ever.  What is it?  The Lifer?  Yeah.  The Lifer card?  I will never have to deal with another token booth clerk again.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  What kind of card is it?  All I know is I handed in my credit card and I don't even know how...  Oh, it re-ups.  It's like a...  I don't even know how much money they just took off my credit card.  Oh, yeah.  Because I do the same thing with EasyPass.  It automatically comes off my card.  I will never have to deal with that prick again. 
[01:21:30]  Even though I shoved it in his face last night.  What did you do last night?  You saw him again?  Oh, yeah.  I purposely went to go find him.  Hello, my friend.  We meet again, my friend.  That's stinky.  He thinks he's out of my mind.  After the show yesterday, remember during the live read, I said I got my effing token  douchebag?  Yeah.  I had one token left.  I made sure I went right to the booth and showed him I had my token for last night.  Oh, you did?  Oh, yeah.  You ought to just eff with him every day.  He can't do anything to you.  Don't, like, threaten violence, but just walk up and go, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, I was totally rubbing it in his face last night.  You know what you do?  You go, hey, where's the machine?  I put the nickel in and get the seed to feed you.  Can I bring my kids in to pet you?  I'm going to a petting zoo and I'm going to get a bag of feed now.  Get a bag of feed and sprinkle something.  Someone get a camera.  I will do this.  No problem.  I am not done with this guy yet.  Put, put, uh, you know what you do?  Put a sign up. 
[01:22:30]  Tape a sign up on there.  Please do not pet the ass.  Just eff with him every day.  That would be so fun.  And take pictures of it.  I want to see his angered face.  I kill you, my friend.  You know, they never-  I kill you.  You know, they never come out of those booths, though.  I'm going to just-  No, they can't.  I'm going to start putting up notes and you're not going to be able to read what it says from the inside.  If he comes out and kicks your ass, I'm going to laugh.  This guy cannot kick my ass.  Glithering idiot display.  Most guys can kick my ass.  This guy cannot kick my ass.  That's why I'm this brave, my friends. 
[01:23:00]  I kill you, my friend.  All right, let's take a break.  Did the targets arrive?  Targets are in the building.  I saw some hot ladies out there.  I'm assuming they're the targets from Privileged Gentleman's Club, right?  They are here.  Oh, the targets.  All right, we've got to get the festivities rolling next, okay?  Yes.  We'll talk to the targets next for the Cherry Darts for the Xbox contest.  Yes, Anthony?  Huh?  I meant to say Rick, and I said Anthony.  Oh.  What are you writing down?  Oh, Paul Williams at 510? 
[01:23:30]  He's going to be on the phone, remember?  Paul Williams.  He wrote that.  He wrote that.  He's from Smoking the Bandit, right?  He looks like Dr. Zaius.  Yeah.  But he's written so many songs.  I don't even...  What songs did he write?  He wrote some songs for, like, Three Dog Night, I think.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Well, serious questions only for the...  We'll punch him up on you.  For the great Paul Williams.  Yes.  We'll be talking to him at 510 today. 
[01:24:00]  Well, there's radio, there's edgy, there's psychotic, and then there's O&M, the Opie and  Anthony show.  You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power.  WWF Smackdown!  A billion-dollar company hangs in the balance.  Jobs are at risk.  Careers on the line.  And it all comes down to one epic battle.  This Sunday, the Alliance and Team WWF will collide in one goal.  For one goal. 
[01:24:30]  Survival.  As the World Wrestling Federation presents, WWF Survivor Series live on pay-per-view.  It's winner-take-all in the main event, a 10-man elimination tag match.  Oh, my God.  The target has her flow.  We'll be telling the rest of the country after this local break that our target has  the flow.  The Rock, Undertaker, Kane, Chris Jericho, and the big show for Team WWF versus Stone Cold  Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Shane McMahon, Rob Van Dam, and Booker T for the Alliance.  Can Team WWF put aside the differences to save their jobs? 
[01:25:00]  Or will the Alliance strike the final blow and crumble Vince McMahon's billion-dollar empire?  Only one way to find out.  WWF Survivor Series this Sunday, live on pay-per-view, 8 Eastern, 7 Central, presented by Xbox.  That's right.  WWF Survivor Series on pay-per-view this Sunday.  And SmackDown tonight at 8.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  The contestants are here, Ed.  The target is here.  Nice. 
[01:25:30]  Terry darts for the Xbox on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sean, what's going on?  Oh, nothing.  Just letting you know that worst speeding you could ever get, don't ever grab the belt  when it's on its way down.  Oh, that is so true.  You just got to lay there and take it.  You got to take it like a man.  Take it like a man.  I made the mistake one time of grabbing the belt when it was on its way down, and my dad's  like, look up on the belt now.  He's like, no, you're going to have to find something else to kill me with, man.  One thing good when you're just living with, like, your mom, it gets to a point where she 
[01:26:00]  has no ability to physically...  Keep you back?  Yeah, yeah.  There's no more physical punishment anymore.  Your father can still crack you right up until you're teens, you know what I mean?  Yeah, but it was always a drag when you finally realized growing up, it's like, oh, wow, I  can take dad.  What a bummer.  But by that point, you know what it is, though?  By that point, you're not doing things, or if you're still doing things that he wants  to hit you for, you're pretty dysfunctional anyway. 
[01:26:30]  You know what I mean?  The day you stood up for dad, it was kind of a drag.  It's like, oh, look at this.  Yeah.  Oh, I can beat him up.  Yeah, you know, I never even reached that point.  It wasn't even like that.  I guess I can make believe he's stronger than me.  Oh.  Keep his pride up.  Keep his pride up.  He's losing his hair.  Oh, it's like...  I'll give him a break.  Like the lion in the pride chasing out the old head of the pride.  Right.  He's grabbing my arm, and I can flip him like nothing, but all right, I'll make believe  I'm struggling.  Why are you clawing me, Simba? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  I remember that day.  It was a drag.  Yeah.  But the mom thing is hysterical.  One day that happened to me.  Like, she tried to do something.  I don't know.  I must have been...  I don't even know how old I was.  But she took, like, this swing at me and hit me in my shoulder with that flat-handed  fist, girly thing, punch thing.  Did he at least act and go, ow?  No, I went like...  That's not a laugh, and she knew it was over.  And then he picked up the refrigerator and threw it across the room to show her. 
[01:27:30]  Now I am the master.  Rob from the Bronx.  Dudes, my mom used to crack us in the lips with her unbreakable comb.  Check this out.  Oof.  She would just snap it back and whack our lips.  So we looked like the Commodores for talking back to her.  Oh, that had a hurt.  Could you imagine?  My mom had the blue comb, man.  She could do stuff with her blue comb.  Pull it back and let it fly.  What, Rick?  Your dad had a name for his belt? 
[01:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  The name of the belt was Charlie.  That's good.  Don't make me get Charlie.  Oh, no, no, no.  It was worse than that.  Go get Charlie.  Oh, go get...  Yeah, when they made you...  You know, that's just torture.  Go get...  That is mental abuse.  When...  Yeah, go get your own beating instrument.  Well, I had to go get my own stick.  Stick.  Gee, Pa.  Do I have to go out to the Saudi when you beat me?  I had to get my switch.  Did you have to go all the way to Mankato or Walnut Grove to... 
[01:28:30]  Did your dad at least know how to make ice?  What?  Yes.  Insight.  Long story.  No, I used to have to go get the belt.  It's actually a very short story, Rick.  No, she's having surgery today.  I'll give her a break today.  Tomorrow I'll tell the story.  Okay.  Yeah, we have our target here. 
[01:29:00]  We have the contestants for Cherry Darts.  Yeah, she's getting primed, Anthony.  How the hell do you get primed?  She's just getting ready.  Let's just put it that way.  Cleaning the flow.  Oh, yeah.  We got to tell everyone what's going on.  Our target from Privileged Gentleman's Club.  I swear to God.  We cannot catch a break on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  We've been like, we've been billboarding this thing like it's going to be one of the hottest  radio things ever, right?  Yeah.  With our hot, sexy girl, Ivy the blonde from Privileged Gentleman's Club.  She's coming down once again.  She's here.  Yeah.  And then she whispered to Rick that she's having that, that time. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, great.  That time.  This always happens.  This is every girl that shows up here.  That just seems to happen.  They got a fuse.  I don't know what happens.  All right.  So, is that going to be prominently displayed as we throw the cherries out?  And how are we going to tell now if the cherry hit?  Depends how many days into it she is, I guess.  We all know how that works.  All right.  So, there's something to look forward to. 
[01:30:00]  Hey, let's get some of these contestants in.  Huh?  Scott on the National Line 5.  You want me to go to him?  Scott.  Yeah.  Guys, you've got to kill, man.  What happened?  Oh, man.  My mom smacked me with a belt.  Yeah.  I laughed at her.  Yeah, because you get to that point.  Right, right, you know.  Well, she got even.  My dad was a carpet installer, and she went and got a piece of tackler strip.  Oh, yeah.  You know that wood strip that's all around the perimeter of a room that they attach to the 
[01:30:30]  carpet there with the little nails in it?  Exactly.  Oh, man.  It only took once.  I learned my lesson quick.  That would hurt, man.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  That's child abuse.  Bye.  Nowadays, you know, you give a little kid a whack on the ass.  All of a sudden, you're in public.  You're in the store.  You give the kid that little whack in the ass.  Whoop!  Whoop!  Whoop!  Whoop!  Foster home.  You're in jail.  Joan, what's up? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, hi.  Anyway, guys, I've noticed a trend with your show lately.  Yeah.  Every time you have these young, beautiful women in, something happens.  Well, we don't care.  You don't care.  Well, you know.  You have a solution?  Yes, I do.  I think you need to go with a slightly older woman.  May not be quite as good looking.  Post-menopause.  But you're not a problem anymore.  Oh, my God.  Post-menopause woman.  Oh, help us out. 
[01:31:30]  We need that.  We're guys.  I'm getting my hot flashes.  We want to...  I know.  No hot flashes.  We want to make this hard for the guys.  We don't want it like they're throwing cherries into the Grand Canyon.  Oh.  Nobody said anything about a Grand Canyon.  You know, you can still be desirable and beautiful there.  After your time.  Just need you to...  For sure.  Sure.  Have you gone through your time?  I'm going.  Are you?  What's happening now?  Are you getting hot flashes? 
[01:32:00]  No, not really.  Just stopped having it.  Things drying up on you?  A couple of...  A couple of great ones.  Oh, no.  As a matter of fact, it's better than it ever was.  I picture...  No, because you know what happens after menopause?  Picture the scene of the dinosaurs walking across those dried up lake beds that are cracking  underneath them.  That's what I picture.  I don't think so.  It's the end of an era.  Joan, how old of a lady are you?  45.  Oh, you're only 45 and you're already going through that time?  Would you like to come in and show us what's going on?  Oh, sure.  All right.  Hold on the line.  I would enjoy checking that out, Joan. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  Hold on the line.  Hold on the line.  We'll talk to Joan and get her down here.  She says she's still very desirable.  All right.  I've heard they've got to use certain things to get things going after the menopause thing.  A little friction is what I'm hearing.  And I've got the list of contestants in front of me.  All right.  As we change the subject real fast, can we talk to Frank from Philly?  Yeah.  He came all the way from Philly for the Cherry Dart for the Xbox competition.  He's the poor guy that lived by the mall. 
[01:33:00]  Hey, Frank.  What's up?  All the way from Philly.  What's happening?  Philly.  What's going on with your Sixers, bro?  I don't know.  Well, Iverson's back.  They won three in a row.  We're all right.  That's true, actually.  Iverson was the whole reason they were losing.  He wasn't in the lineup.  So, okay.  You live by the mall?  Yes.  In a duplex?  In a duplex.  A duplex.  Talked to this guy a couple days ago.  Yeah.  And what do you think, man?  What do you think of your chances?  Have you been checking out the competition out there?  I've been checking out the competition.  I went to college for five years, so I played a lot of beer pong. 
[01:33:30]  Five years of college?  Five years of school.  A lot of beer pong.  Where did you get?  What kind of...  Oh, I'm still...  I'm in my fifth year.  Oh, okay.  I'm an accounting major.  Account...  Five years for accounting?  It's not that hard to count.  Isn't that just math?  It's boring.  How much do you have to learn?  Add, subtract.  So, I got a fun life ahead of me.  As an accountant?  Yeah.  All right.  Number, pencil pushing.  All right, well...  Some dark office with a single light bulb swinging overhead. 
[01:34:00]  Cigarette butts.  Just smoking like crazy.  Whole place reeks of smoke.  The bands around my arms.  Oh, there's a Smith & Wesson in your drawer that every day you promise you're going to  take out and put in your mouth.  I can't wait.  That's funny.  All right.  Hey, Frank, did you meet Roger, who's in the 13th grade?  Hello.  Yes, I met Roger.  Also known as Suffolk Community College.  Yeah, his buddy's the guy that got naked for the Yankees tickets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Roger, uh...  They're very proud of that.  Suffolk Community College. 
[01:34:30]  Here he is.  Hey, Roger.  How's it going?  How you doing, man?  All right.  He's in the 13th grade at Suffolk Community College.  At Suffolk Community.  And what were you studying?  Communication.  Communications at Suffolk Community.  Yep.  And how's that going for you?  It's going all right, man.  I got my intro to broadcasting.  Intro to broadcasting.  What are they teaching you in intro to broadcasting?  You don't do anything until next semester.  You have to wait until...  Hey, you know, for a communications major, you don't even know how to use a microphone yet.  All right, we'll teach you something that'll come in handy. 
[01:35:00]  Pull the mic up near your mouth.  Is that about it?  Am I a little better now?  Is that the first class we teach you how to turn the TV on?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Now, what have you learned so far?  Nothing.  In broadcasting.  In broadcasting.  It's just the two basic classes, and the next semester you get into everything, so you basically learn absolutely nothing the first semester.  But basic...  Wait a minute.  Now, it's the 15th of November.  School started with...  Yeah, no, this is the first semester.  You learn...  It's nothing.  You've learned nothing.  Not really, man.  You've had to have learned something. 
[01:35:30]  What did you learn that you might take with you in your future endeavors?  There's nothing.  There's a rousing endorsement for Suffolk Community College.  Like you said, did Opie look at Suffolk when he was trying to get into it?  No.  No, I didn't think so.  It must be that strong social life at Suffolk.  Maybe that's it.  A lot of partying going on at Suffolk.  You can't make the classes?  Something like that?  Yeah.  Yeah?  All right.  Well, best of luck.  He's a good communicator.  I like him.  Yeah, but then I got my baseball, remember?  So I got my fullback.  Oh, he's the baseball guy. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  The baseball scholarship guy.  How's that going for you?  That's going good.  Yeah?  Yep.  All right.  Any prospects for...  I told you, man.  Stony Brook is looking at me.  Stony Brook.  Well, there you go.  Better college?  I don't know if it's going to get you a professional career in baseball, but okay.  Further out east.  All right.  There you go.  Well, Roger and Frank, thank you.  We'll be outside in a few minutes.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We'll take them in two at a time here. 
[01:36:30]  Paul Williams.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look who's on the phone.  It's Paul Williams.  Right here in the apple.  Alive.  He's still alive.  My God.  Well, you know something?  That's a good thing.  That's a question some people had.  Because you've been around a while.  Yeah, I disappeared for a while.  And then you disappeared.  You dropped off the face of the earth.  I did.  You know, I just...  You know, I had one of those life change...  To me, it's the biggest part of my story.  Eleven years ago, I got sober.  And I'd already been gone for about five years and didn't realize it. 
[01:37:00]  You have one of those drunk stories of your career kind of going down the tubes for drinking?  You know, not so much.  I'm working on that myself.  Are you really?  Well, you know what?  We can talk about that later.  We'll get off the air and maybe I can save your life.  No, you know, I got sober and I didn't know if I was going to do music anymore.  I was just...  You know, I thought maybe that part of my life was over.  And about five years ago, I just kind of fell in love with it again and started writing.  Started running off to Nashville to write.  And Jimmy Webb talked me into coming into the Apple and we're having a really nice run at Feinstein's. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, Paul.  Yes, sir.  When was the last time you did anything relevant?  Anything relevant?  Yeah.  Like, what are you doing?  Like, what was the last thing you did?  I remember you from, like, Smokey and the Bandit.  I loved Smokey and the Bandit.  One of my favorite movies.  The last thing, I'm so stunned by the question, what's the last time you did anything relevant?  You know, I took my son to lunch today.  That was relevant to me, you know?  You're talking about something of notable...  Yeah, in your career, let's say. 
[01:38:00]  I'm sure you're a great parent there.  You know, let's see.  What would matter to you?  I had a chart record about a year ago with a group called Diamond Rio.  Oh, yeah.  Number two record, a song called You're Gone.  I was nominated for a Grammy.  That would be important to you, for the Muppet Christmas Carol.  Oh, of course.  Okay, how about this one?  This June, I was inducted into the Songwriter Hall of Fame.  Oh, yeah.  Now, this guy's written more songs than you can even imagine, Opie. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, you know what?  This guy's written a lot of songs.  Also, you know, it's just, I'm stunned by the question.  I mean, it's just, you know, it's like if you live by the Enquirer, and if you live by the charts, your life is meaningless, you know?  Paul, let me tell you, that's Opie here, and I've got a problem.  Opie, what's the matter?  Opie, we need to send you to, you need to go to college to get a communications degree.  He's got an anger management problem that he's dealing with, and we're trying to get him through that. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, you just said, we haven't seen your face around now.  Yeah, I know.  I quit for a long time, you know?  And I just, you know, I wasn't sure that I even wanted to come back and do this anymore.  Paul.  But I started out a little, you know, I mean...  Paul.  Sure.  Why didn't they cast you in the new Planet of the Apes movie?  Didn't do the Planet of the Apes.  I am in the new Rules of Attraction, you know, the new Roger Avery picture, which is going to be a really big picture.  I thought you would have made a good Dr. Zayas.  You know what, I love, my honey, my wife actually had a crush on Virgil, you know, when I played the ape in Battle for the Planet of the Apes. 
[01:39:30]  He was actually in Battle for the Planet of the Apes.  Yeah, yeah.  He was Virgil.  Yeah.  I remember the episode of The Odd Couple.  Who could forget that?  You know what, they showed it a couple nights ago, I guess.  Where Felix's daughter falls in love and starts chasing Paul Williams around.  Now wait, you know, that was 30, that was a long time ago.  1970.  But they show it all the time.  It must be relevant, despite its date.  See, Opie?  Yeah.  Hey, Opie, come on, Opie.  Paul, what happened with the boozing? 
[01:40:00]  I'm sorry, Paul.  You know, I just, it's a progressive disease.  It got worse and worse and worse.  And I, you know, after Ishtar, I kind of just sort of hung it up, you know.  Yeah.  And what, you just crawled into a bottle and didn't look back?  Oh, God.  You know, you're doing more, you know.  I sit on the council, the board of directors of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug  Dependence.  We would talk about the kind of people like you, Opie.  You know, we'd throw out questions like that, you know.  You have to realize that alcoholism is a disease, you know. 
[01:40:30]  No, it's not.  These are not bad people trying to become good people.  These are sick people.  Hold on, hold on.  Ed's got a great philosophy on drinking and smoking.  It's not a disease.  I think, um...  You can stop drinking at any time.  Oh, you can't.  Did you need a lot of help, Paul?  We just said that.  Opie, again, of course.  Opie, you know, you are a mindless twit and I cannot talk to you.  I'll talk to you, though, Anthony.  Thank you, Paul Williams.  I've been a fan for many years.  What didn't you...  Wait, wait, wait.  Paul, what didn't you hear?  It's Anthony's philosophy on the whole thing.  Did alcoholism is not a disease? 
[01:41:00]  I was going to discuss it with Paul, not come out with some inane comment like you did, Opie.  You short bastard.  I was going to be nice about it.  Well, that's a whole different story.  Then I'll talk to you, Opie.  You know what you...  I don't need to talk to you.  I think...  Opie.  I think my experiences have been that what you do is you take whatever you're addicted  to and you throw it away because you have a decision every time you pick it up to pick  it up or not.  All right.  Here's what I would like you to do. 
[01:41:30]  I would like you to do.  You'll really understand addiction if you do this.  All right.  I want you to take a quadruple, take four times what is recommended of X-lax and then  have the willpower to not take a major dump.  That's what it's like to live with an addiction.  Is it?  You don't know what you're talking about, so you need to be quiet for a minute and learn  a little bit about this disease.  It's a disease.  There's a genetic propensity towards this disease.  It can be an acquired disease.  Somehow you cross the line from use to abuse to addiction. 
[01:42:00]  It's a horrific disease that people are dying of all the time.  You need to stop being closed-minded about this.  Paul, didn't you know when you brought the bottle or glass to your lips that you were  doing something that was not good?  No, you're sitting there with an absolutely clear mind, I assume, trying to make choices  and assuming that I can make those same choices when I'm medicated.  When you're medicated, you can't make clear choices.  All right.  But you know what?  At this point in my life, every day is a gift.  And if you ever have a problem, I hope you have the great gift, the miracle of recovery 
[01:42:30]  that I've been given.  And you know what?  About 10% of this community, it's, well, there are millions of us around the world and recovery  works.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  You know, I just, I had a little discussion there.  Yeah, I like that.  I like that.  That's fine.  Some people have a problem.  You know, the American Medical Association back in the 60s did a study called the Jelnic  Study, which proved it was a disease.  So if you want to go to the books, you'll find it's right there.  O.P.  O.P.  Guy O.P.  Why don't you come down to Feinstein's? 
[01:43:00]  You know, if you can rustle up the books.  What's going on?  And see Jimmy Webb and Liz Calloway and I.  We're there through the 24th.  And it's, you know, it's, I mean, some pretty good.  Translation, boring.  She's a wonderful singer.  Jimmy, I mean, think about Jimmy's songs.  Didn't we?  MacArthur Park, By the Time I Get to Phoenix, you know?  And name some of your hits that you've got.  Major ones?  Evergreen won the Oscar.  Evergreen won the Oscar.  From the Stars Born.  We've only just begun Rainy Days and Mondays, an old-fashioned love song.  You and Me Against the World, Out in the Country. 
[01:43:30]  I like Three Dog Nights.  The Love Boat, please.  I mean, didn't writing The Love Boat garner me your respect for life, O.P.?  Paul, I've got to tell you, I like Three Dog Nights version of just an old-fashioned love song.  A little better than yours.  I do, too.  And I also like their version of Out in the Country and Family Man, both of which the top 10.  Wow, I did a dream.  I had a really wonderful career, and I'm thrilled with my life.  You always sounded like you were a little, you needed to blow your nose when you were singing.  Well, I did.  In those days, I did.  Oh, a little Coke there? 
[01:44:00]  Of course.  You know, that was a part of my problem, too.  But it doesn't matter which, you know, what you're abusing, you're abusing it.  There's no difference between a rock star shooting heroin in L.A. and a bored housewife drinking Listerine.  It's still trying, you know, using a medication to try to fix your feelings.  It doesn't work.  Ah, well, okay.  It doesn't work.  You guys are hard and fast, man.  No, no.  You have to, you know, you have to be a lively 61 to keep up with you two. 
[01:44:30]  61 you are now?  Yes, sir.  God bless you, Paul Williams.  So why were you drinking there, Paul?  Was it the hype thing, or was it an abusive parent?  What was it?  Who is this?  That's Opie again.  Opie, is there any meat to your thought, or is it, I mean, are we just going to sit with this teenage?  I give up, Paul.  Why were you drinking?  Don't you have an intelligent question to ask me?  I think that's a good question.  Why did you go to the, you know, drown your sorrows in the bottle? 
[01:45:00]  It's disease, Opie.  You didn't choose it.  You know, a lot of us drank because we felt fabulous, because we had it all, because we were making millions and we were having, you know, why is it that most alcoholics are, you know, are a complete cross-section of the country?  Pilots, lawyers, judges, teachers, it's a disease, Opie.  Get that.  You know, once you learn that, once you get that down, you let you have a second beer in your driver's life.  Sometimes he needs a little.  Paul, you convince me.  Relax.  Okay.  Jesus.  Anything else I can do for you guys? 
[01:45:30]  No, that's okay.  Thank you.  Go ahead.  I just wrote today.  You asked what I did recently.  I just turned in today the new song, the new motion picture, Some of All Fears, starring Ben Affleck.  I just wrote the title.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you did that.  No, something's wrong with his phone.  I cannot.  He was calling from L.A.  Please.  You did that. 
[01:46:00]  He lost his cell.  Oh, my God.  He lost his cell.  He was on a cell phone and he lost his cell.  Oh, you'd have liked him, Ben, with how much you drink.  Being preached to.  I love being good cop.  I don't have to sit there and cringe with everything that comes out of my mouth, dude.  You were too good today, man.  No, it gives you the opportunity to be a real prick.  No, you're scaring me.  I'm like, wow, maybe I really am a prick because you sounded really convincing as a good cop today.  You see, I got to do that to keep them on the phone. 
[01:46:30]  But if you check the schedule, I was supposed to be a good cop today and you were supposed to be a bad cop, my friend.  It's to keep them.  I keep them on the phone so you can keep the abuse going.  Oh, my God.  I said the Dr. Zayas thing, right?  And then it turns out he was in one of the Planet of the Ate movies.  Yeah, but I was saying Dr. Zayas got out the makeup.  It looks more and more like Dr. Zayas.  And then Shorty.  And, yeah, well, that was a little has-been corner there, I guess.  I love the Paul Williams.  He'll call back, right?  Relevant. 
[01:47:00]  He got so pissed off at that, man.  Oof.  He said, who's that?  The midget?  All right.  We're going outside the studio to play Cherry Darts for the Xbox.  I'm just picturing him all pissed off at the other end of the phone when he heard a click.  He's going to start drinking.  Yeah, God damn, I need a drink.  Son of a bitch, I can't believe he hung up on me.  This sobriety ain't working.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Give me a double scotch, those bastards.  Coming down in three-part harmonia. 
[01:47:30]  Relevant.  I'll show him relevant.  Give me the bottle.  Wow.  Ouch.  Okay.  Cherry Darts next.  Hey, this is Billy Idol, and I'm wild, and I'm crazy, and I'm listening to Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  We are Sports Guys, Blaine and Craig.  Morning, Don and Mike.  Midday.  Opie and Anthony.  Afternoon.  Ron and Fez at night.  We are 1027 WNEW.  Oh, what a coincidence.  Anthony!  Bud Light!  Yes, Bud Light. 
[01:48:00]  When I'm drinking a Bud Light, I love it.  When I was drunk and singing, just an old-fashioned love song.  Coming down in three-part harmonia.  Remember Bugsy Malone?  Bugsy Malone.  I was so drunk on Bud Light.  I love Bud Light.  When I was drinking, I would only drink Bud Light.  The only beer that was light enough to fit in my small little body.  My tiny, teeny little body. 
[01:48:30]  I would drink shots of Bud Light out of a thimble.  And it would go, oh, it was so good, so smooth.  Tasted just like the real thing.  That's right.  Bud Light.  Bud Light.  I'll write a song about it.  Bud Light, I love Bud Light.  Paul Williams loves Bud Light.  I'd wear the cap as a hat.  Bud Light.  Opie and Anthony.  N-E-W-T-W-N-E-W. 
[01:49:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I think we're live on the air.  Everyone say hey.  Yeah, we got a few people in here, huh?  We have a lot of people outside the studio, Anthony.  And we're getting ready for the Xbox competition.  Yeah, Rick, I think that's good enough.  Rick is marking off the bullseye on the target.  The target has a name, Anthony. 
[01:49:30]  Her name is Ivy.  Of course.  From Privilege Gentleman's Club, 23rd and 11th Avenue in the city.  All right, Rick.  Rick.  Don't ruin it.  Don't make it look like a clown.  We like a natural look.  We like a natural look.  She looks great.  All right.  What do the contestants think of Ivy, huh?  Digging it.  Liking it.  And here she goes.  She's got her target on. 
[01:50:00]  I don't even know what the hell Rick drew all over her.  What did Rick do to the bullseye?  He, like, colored all red around it.  She's got all.  Yeah.  She's got all.  That looks like an official board.  How would you know what a 16-year-old looks like?  All right, all right.  Let's calm down.  Rick, she looks like a red zebra.  I know.  What did you do?  That's not a dartboard.  She's got five lines going up her belly up to the bottom of her chest. 
[01:50:30]  There are lines all over.  Would you like to do it yourself?  No.  I just don't think there's that many lines are necessary.  Yeah, why don't you take out the top two lines?  You can't, man.  Why not?  It's written in lipstick.  She could take it off, right?  Yeah, try to smear out the top two lines.  She's just going to smear it.  Oh, man.  That's kind of coming off.  All right, so Ivy is in place on the table, Anthony. 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  We have 13 contestants.  That's why Rick drew them on, so he could wipe them off.  I guess this is the line.  How many feet away would you say?  Like 15 feet?  Yeah, not even.  Not even?  12 feet maybe?  All right, so...  25.  Yeah.  Stinky's got the fluff and the cherries.  I'm the fluff guy.  That's what he's saying.  That's what he's going around saying.  He did a good joke.  And basically, we're going to have a qualifying round. 
[01:51:30]  Is that how we're doing this?  Yeah, if whoever gets in the concentric circles Rick has drawn gets to move on to round two.  And round two will be the finals where we go for accuracy, right?  Right.  Okay.  That first one's kind of a warm-up, you know what I mean?  Yeah, just because a lot of people are nervous, you know, and they want to...  Now, the cherries are dipped in marshmallow fluff, which is really gooey.  Yeah, it's so gooey. 
[01:52:00]  You know what's going to happen, Stink?  Yeah, the cherries are going to stick to their fingers and no one's going to get even...  Well, that makes it that much more difficult.  You've got to take that into consideration when you throw.  All right, you've got to kind of throw and do a little twisting with your fingers or something.  Rick, put the microphone on Ivy.  Ivy.  I was going to say, if a guy knows how to handle Sticky, then he's really good.  Sticky.  Sticky's not good.  Oh, Sticky's great.  Slippery good.  Sticky suck. 
[01:52:30]  It depends on what you're sticking together.  Stickery, stickery, stickery.  I love when Blanc's trying to converse.  Yeah, isn't that cute?  You don't get out enough, do you?  No, why is Sticky good?  I'll argue with you with this.  Sticky never good.  Slippery good.  People confuse the two.  Yeah, Sticky means...  If it's getting sticky, that's bad.  Yeah, something's going on.  Sticky is probably what you're going to be experiencing for the next three to four days.  That's Sticky.  Crime scene sex.  All right. 
[01:53:00]  Well, Ivy's ready.  Why don't we give this a shot?  All right.  Up first is Frank from Philly, 22 years old.  Here he is, the guy that lives by the mall.  In a van down by the river.  Now, Frank, anything you want to say before you throw the cherries there?  I've got a great number four shirt on.  Well, I've been playing beer pong for five years.  I think I'm going to be good at this.  Beer pong.  All right.  You've got two cherries to make it to the next round, okay?  No stepping over the line and just lob it in. 
[01:53:30]  Try to get within those circles.  Oh, see?  He hit her on the kneecap.  I've got to help everyone.  Just cover half the cherries with the fluff so they have something to grasp onto.  How do you get it out of it?  Just put it in by the step.  Use the step.  Well.  All right.  Here goes Frank with it.  Man, stinky.  More power to you.  I could never do that.  It's all sticky.  Here goes Frank with his second cherry.  Oh, and he gets in.  Oh, and he makes it.  He just makes it.  He makes it to the finals. 
[01:54:00]  Wow.  You go to the next round, my friend.  You go to the next round.  Give me a point.  Wow.  That, what a close throw.  Fairly made the board, Anthony.  Just hitting the outside ring on the upper region of the target.  Rick's got the field mic, and you heard the thaw.  I've got to say, that outside ring, about a little over a foot away from ground zero,  would you say?  Is it?  Yeah, from the target.  From the bullseye.  So he just, he missed the bullseye by about a foot, but it's still in the targeted off area. 
[01:54:30]  Very good.  All right.  Up next is Roger, who's in the 13th grade at Suffolk Community College.  Roger.  See, it's about.  Here he goes.  About where Chambers Street would be from ground zero, or?  I don't try to talk.  You're not here to talk.  Strain those brain muscles.  All right.  Here goes Roger.  Again, hitting off the knee.  Almost the exact same spot that our first contestant hit off of.  He's really got to take into consideration the stickiness of that cherry. 
[01:55:00]  Roger, anything you want to say before you throw your second dart there?  Suck.  You pretty much hit the same spot.  You've got to compensate just like our first competitor did.  Make sure you get it in that target.  That's all right.  That's all right.  He's whatever he wants to do.  All right.  Here we go.  Roger's second shot.  Here it is.  Second shot.  He's at the lovely Ivy.  Who's lining up.  Who's sitting on that table looking very nice.  Here we go.  Come on, Roger.  He's got to get it in that target area. 
[01:55:30]  Oh.  It was on a bounce.  Hold on.  I'm going to make a ruling.  I'm going to make a ruling on this.  It did.  Wait a minute.  Excuse me.  It did bounce off the table, but it bounced within that target area.  So I'm allowing it.  Wow.  Yeah.  Roger makes it to the next round.  If it would have bounced out of the target area, see, there's an imaginary, which Rick is now drawing in. 
[01:56:00]  A target area on the table.  It encompasses a circle, Opie, which is a complete circle surrounding the bullseye, which does include the table.  All right.  Let's go to Sean.  Now, wait a minute.  In the finals, if that happens, we will count where you hit on the table and not where it lands on her.  That's right.  Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.  Anthony, Sean, you might remember from our radio show, he defaced another radio station's billboard. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, damn you.  With a huge wow.  Damn these vandals.  We love when that happens.  And, Sean, any thoughts here?  No.  Not a thought in his head just like our bullseye.  I like that.  Smartass.  Yes.  All right, Sean, let's throw her first.  Oh, and no, you missed on that one.  Yes, totally.  You missed.  You missed our target.  The imaginary line does not go behind her, which the cherry kind of bounced off her sides. 
[01:57:00]  Sean, second shot.  And...  Oh, yeah, okay.  The closest so far on the target.  Very nice.  Good form.  All right, uh...  He is a few inches away, yeah.  Our first female.  Where's Erin?  Oh, here she comes.  Don't give story.  Just a girl.  She's just a girl, Anthony.  All right.  From Delaware.  She's from Delaware.  And, um, she's lining up. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, that one went way, uh, left.  She just threw like a girl.  Yeah.  You throw like a girl.  Yeah, yeah, and, um, yeah, clean it off a little and make it easier to slide out of  your fingers.  But really line this shot up.  And I think you need...  I don't think you have the energy to just thrust it.  Try a lob.  That might help you out a little bit.  All right, here goes Erin.  Oh, my God.  She almost hit Rick.  She almost hit Rick.  Oh, Erin.  Erin's out of the competition.  Oh, our first person that's eliminated. 
[01:58:00]  We forgot to mention there is a boobie prize today, too, by the way.  You hit those two targets over there.  Right.  And you can pick from our prize closet.  A boobie prize.  Okay.  A boobie prize.  All right.  All right.  Up next is Sean Dillon.  Have you ever worked on the prizes?  Dillon.  Dillon.  Sean's the guy that's half black and half white, right?  That's me.  That is me.  You look more white than black, though.  Yeah.  That ain't working for you.  No, we like Sean. 
[01:58:30]  Sean, where are you from, man?  I'm from North Bergen, New Jersey.  North Bergen, New Jersey.  And here he goes.  Sean Dillon from Jersey.  Step up to that line.  Uh-oh.  See, there's where that stickiness of the fluff really came into play.  It stuck to his finger, dropped about eight feet in front of him.  Missing the target totally.  Well, how could he concentrate?  Look at that.  I know.  It's a very nice target.  All right.  Here's Sean's second shot. 
[01:59:00]  Here we go.  Cherry darts for the Xbox.  Oh, no.  He's out.  I can't believe this.  How did you miss that?  Nothing.  You almost hit Rick in the head.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  It wasn't even close to, you know, Ground Zero.  That was more closer to Canal Street.  All right.  Where's Jen?  Is it Jen?  Oh, the pothead's up.  Here she goes.  Yeah.  She's from Rockland County.  She's the me girl from yesterday.  Her boyfriend's a loser. 
[01:59:30]  And she's a very hot stoner.  20 years old with a...  Hold on.  What are you...  Whoa.  You spray...  You're just outside.  Is there a mark?  Is there a mark?  She's just outside the target.  That was the first shot.  The target.  First shot was out of the zone.  Yeah.  I wasn't supposed to go yet.  You got to do it now.  Yeah, really.  You step up and start throwing.  We got to do a little interview with you.  Yeah.  Anything you want to say?  Oh, my God.  Me?  You know what you got to do? 
[02:00:00]  Hold it like a roach.  Just like...  And then, like, lob it in a little bit.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, can I throw it?  Whenever you're ready.  I think Stinky's in love.  All right.  Here she goes.  Second shot.  Jen, the stoner.  Oh!  Oh!  Whap, whap, whap.  I can't believe it.  She throws really hard.  I'm glad she missed that one.  Yeah, Ivy, she throws real hard?  Oh, yeah.  Woo!  I don't think that would have hurt. 
[02:00:30]  Holy cherry.  Some tells me you've been beaten with harder things.  All right.  Up next is Mike from Long Island, man.  Mike.  23, still in college, without a car.  Yeah, I have no car.  Can someone pick me up at the train station when I get home?  No car.  Living at home.  All right.  Here goes Mike.  He's lining up.  He's, uh...  See, I...  The last three guys...  See, again, the stickiness of the fluff coming into play. 
[02:01:00]  Stinky.  Sabotaging our contestants.  Now, a lot of people realize on that second shot to wipe that fluff off a little bit,  where you're holding it.  Yeah, we've only...  We only have three guys going into the finals so far.  Unbelievable.  Here's Mike's second shot from Belmore, Long Island.  Can I get a redo?  No redos.  No redos.  Oh!  My God.  I thought this was going to be a lot easier.  I got lost by that guy over there.  What, did he pull a Noonan? 
[02:01:30]  Noonan!  That guy pulled a Noonan.  Should we give him another shot or what?  Oh!  Yeah!  Everyone...  All the people that are eliminated already are saying no.  Wow.  Tough crowd.  Tough crowd.  Tough crowd.  All right, Mike, any final words?  I suck.  I suck.  All right, up next is Jesus from the Bronx.  Jesus!  Remember, clear that fluff off of where you're holding it.  Jesus lost a scholarship to college, Anthony, because he got hurt the first day of football  practice.  Oh, he's the guy. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, he had to go back to the hood, and he's got nothing going on in his life, so...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Where did it land?  Out of the zone.  Out of the zone.  Oh, you're just out of the zone.  Yeah.  He's just out of the zone.  Original shot hit right there.  Okay.  Jesus just missed.  He just missed.  Okay, here goes the second cherry dart from Jesus.  He has an arm.  Concentrate.  Oh, no!  He hit her in the shin.  I can't believe this.  Jesus is out!  Anybody who shoots me in the middle of the thigh or the lower leg is just not missing in. 
[02:02:30]  Okay, terrific.  Another contestant.  Step right up.  We've got to get some more qualifiers here, guys.  You've got to concentrate on this throw.  Where's Scott?  Scott's the guy that had all the signs at Raw.  Yeah.  On Long Island.  They won, like, a Samsung DVD and all that, and he traded in all his prizes to try to win  the Xbox.  Right.  He's really spitting up his hands. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, my God.  We've got a professional.  The closest yet.  He got her left thigh.  Very good.  Very good.  He moves on to the finals, Anthony.  Good job.  Very nice shot, Scott.  You're in.  No need for that second shot.  Where's Colin?  No need for that second shot.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  Colin, what's your story?  I can't really read this.  I was here with my snake for the contest.  Came in second place.  Screwed out of the trip to San Juan.  Right.  I remember that.  All right. 
[02:03:30]  That was when the baby tiger showed up.  The Bengal tiger, right?  Well, what are we going to do?  All right.  Goddamn tiger.  We ought to give him the trip.  Here's.  He had a snake, too.  Here's Colin's first.  There he goes.  Cherry dart.  Toward Ivy.  Oh.  And he doesn't even need to throw again.  Another pro.  Very good.  Colin moves on to the finals for the Xbox.  You know, that first shot, very telling about where we might end up when the accuracy really  counts, Opie.  Very nice.  Someone named Sports Babble. 
[02:04:00]  Up next is Keith the Cop's cousin, Al.  Oh, the heckler.  Yeah, he's the Noonan guy.  All right.  Wait a minute.  I have to.  All right.  I'll give her a $20 bill because I'm not used to.  Hold on.  Why don't you talk into the mic?  What, Al?  He's doing shit.  I'll give her a $20 bill because I'm not used to throwing anything into a woman's.  You know, into the target.  Okay.  All right.  He's actually giving us some money.  Okay.  He gave her money.  That's all right.  Now they're going to shut us down.  Thanks, Al.  He's on my full cue. 
[02:04:30]  Okay.  Why don't we just throw the darts toward Ivy?  What do you got?  Thank you, Keith the Cop.  Oh, he's got some.  I'll return the favor.  Thank you.  He's got some kind of a lubricant on his fingers.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Over the line.  Over the line.  Hey, hey, hey.  Back it up.  Back it up.  He's a southpaw, Anthony.  There he goes.  Southpaw.  Oh.  And he hits her on the foot.  On the foot.  The top of the foot.  There he goes.  Very unusual throwing style. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, he's got a really weird throw.  He kind of has a swishy.  Loser.  Ivy just got hit in the forehead.  He just hit her in the head.  He just nailed Ivy in the forehead, making her even dumber.  He hit her in the head.  Ivy, how you doing over there?  You all right, Ivy?  I knew he hit her in the head when I heard that hollow thud.  Oh, damn.  Ivy, are you all right? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, I'm great.  You got to watch the S word.  It was funny as S, right?  Use that language.  All right.  Okay, so where's our next competitor?  Paul the Pilot.  Paul the Pilot.  Here he goes.  Here's a guy that, I mean, his life depends on his accuracy.  No, put the wrist rocket down.  No, no, no, no, no.  No slingshots.  No, no.  You brought a slingshot, Anthony.  Paul the Pilot, like I said, his life depends on his accuracy, his hand-eye coordination. 
[02:06:00]  Let's see how well he does it.  You may have seen his work over Central Park in New York.  Over Central Park.  He's drawn wow in the sky with his airplane.  He's got a skywriting plane.  Not lately, no.  No.  Yeah, it's a little rough flying low over Manhattan these days.  I understand, Paul.  Oh, there it is.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You know something?  Paul is over the line.  Paul, we love you.  You got to adhere to every rule. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, man, this is a tough crowd.  It was barely over the line.  It was over the line, like two inches, not even.  So it's a do-over on that shot?  All right, do-over for Paul the Pilot.  Well, yeah, we have to give him the two shots.  We should have informed him.  Is that okay?  Yeah, go ahead.  That's okay, Paul.  That's good.  I would have gave it to you, my friend.  Oh, now he's way off to the left.  Oh, boy.  No, that is a do-over because someone should have informed him that he was over the line.  No, no, put down the real dart.  Put the real dart down. 
[02:07:00]  Everyone's got a bit.  Look at her.  You might pop something.  Here he goes.  He's lining up.  All right.  Lining up, Cinderella boy.  Lining up, this last shot.  Oh, no, Paul.  Now he's out of the competition.  You guys suck.  He was a...  Oh, boy.  That first shot was perfect.  Oh, my God.  Crossing him off the list, Anthony.  I can't read the final name.  Who hasn't gone? 
[02:07:30]  What's your name?  Soon-to-be-divorced Dennis.  Soon-to-be-divorced Dennis.  Oh, you're the one.  The married guy.  The married guy, she lost weight to get into the dress.  Oh, right.  Lost 14 pounds to get into the dress.  And by July...  No, no, got married in July.  The wedding was July.  She had gained all the weight back.  Thanks for running the promo all day.  Oh, you were promo?  You were the promo, huh?  You were the promo for the old Anthony show.  Did she hear it?  No, she was at school.  Ah, good.  All right, this is Dennis, soon-to-be-divorced guy. 
[02:08:00]  There he goes.  He's stepping up to that line, making sure not to go over it this time.  Don't step over it.  And, yeah.  The throw.  Oh, again, almost hitting Rick.  That didn't land in the foosball table, did it?  No.  All right.  And his second shot.  A lot of pressure on that second shot.  As he lines up.  He's using a pitching wedge.  He's concentrating, Anthony.  Oh, he is. 
[02:08:30]  He's...  Ah!  Very ballsy move.  He went underhand.  Very ballsy move.  He went for the underhanded lob.  He pulled a Wilt Chamberlain on us.  And, uh, didn't work.  I stink.  Yeah.  Bye-bye, Dennis.  Soon-to-be-divorced guy.  All right.  Who else do we have?  And who's the final guy?  Our final contestant stepping up.  And what is your name, sir?  Jerome.  Jerome?  Yeah.  All right.  Wait, this guy came from Boston for the competition.  You came from Boston?  All right.  Cool.  Boston representing. 
[02:09:00]  That's good.  All right.  Here goes, uh, Jerome from Boston.  Drove all day just to throw two cherry darts at the lovely, uh, Ivy, who's our target today.  There we go.  Privileged Gentleman's Club.  He's concentrating.  Here we go.  Here he goes.  Oh, wow.  He hit the line.  The line is, uh, fair.  X.  It's on the line.  Yeah, yeah.  If the smear is on the line, it's fair.  The smear is on the line.  It's fair.  We can't go crazy here.  Yeah, you're in.  You guys, you want to take a quick look up here? 
[02:09:30]  You're on the judge.  I see the circular market made.  A lot of it's out, but some of it hit the line.  All right.  That's all.  Jerome moves on to the finals, Anthony.  Jerome's in.  19-year-old from Boston.  Great.  If only Logan's security was that good.  And that's it.  Going to the finals, Frank.  The poor guy that lives by the mall in the duplex from Philly.  Roger, who's in the 13th grade at Suffolk Community College.  Sean, who defaced the other radio station's billboard. 
[02:10:00]  Yep.  Wow sign guy made it.  Colin, 24, from Brooklyn.  And finally, Jerome.  Jerome from Boston.  And that's it.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Six guys will be fighting it out for the Xbox after we take a quick break.  The finals are next.  It's cherry darts for the Xbox.  Let's hear it, guys.  Woo!  Yeah!  And Anthony's show.  New York, Dallas, Chicago, Philly, Cleveland, Columbus, Sacramento, San Francisco. 
[02:10:30]  The Empire is spreading.  Conquer us, you bastards!  Ah, Anthony, also on tonight, WWF Smackdown at 8.  Yes.  On UPN.  A billion-dollar company hangs in the balance.  Jobs at risk.  Careers on the line.  And it comes down to one epic battle.  This Sunday, the Alliance and Team WWF collide for one goal.  Survival.  As the World Wrestling Federation presents WWF Survivor Series.  Live on pay-per-view. 
[02:11:00]  It's winner-take-all in the main event.  A ten-man elimination tag match.  The Rock Undertaker.  Kane.  Chris Jericho on the big show.  For Team WWF versus Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, and Sheen McMahon.  And Rob Van Dam and Booker T for the Alliance.  Can Team WWF put aside their differences to save their job?  Or will the Alliance strike the final blow and crumble Vince McMahon's billion-dollar empire?  The only one company will survive.  Order.  WWF Survivor Series.  This Sunday, live on pay-per-view.  8 Eastern, 7 Central.  Presented by Xbox. 
[02:11:30]  It's WWF Survivor Series.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is  This Station, 1027 WNEW, New York.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We have a lot of people outside the studio.  We're in the middle of cherry darts for the Xbox, Anthony.  Yeah, we are.  What are you laughing at, Stinky?  No, I don't know what Rick's doing. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, he's trying to clean off some of the leftovers from the first shots.  Right.  The fluff doesn't want to come off, right?  The fluff doesn't want to come off?  No, he's trying to clean the dartboard and it's not working too well.  Rick, don't worry about saving the lines.  Just kind of scrape it off.  It don't matter, does it?  No, it doesn't matter.  Rick.  Got sticky.  All right.  Ivy, how are you doing over there? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Hey, I'm having a blast.  Thanks for having me back again.  No, no problem.  You're always welcome.  As long as you look like that.  But naked.  But naked.  Okay, we got the final round.  This is for the Xbox, Ant.  We have five, six contestants left.  Yep.  And they're going to all have three.  Oh, three shots.  At the bullseye.  Rick will be marking them.  And the closest one to that, the bullseye, will win the Xbox. 
[02:13:00]  Now, where is the middle of the bullseye?  Well, the middle of the bullseye.  There's a little controversy.  Yeah, yeah.  I would think it would be.  Are we going with that or that?  I would think, no.  I'm thinking right where, ah, ah, yes.  You know what I mean.  Right there where.  Her name's not Dolores?  It looks like the top of Butter's head. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  You know what we're talking about.  All right, so we're going with that right there, right?  That portion of real estate.  Okay.  Yeah.  And in the event of a tie or something that we can't distinguish who's closer or not,  then they will have a one cherry shoot-off until someone gets closest.  Okay.  That's it.  All right.  The dartboard needs to widen.  Yeah, yeah.  We got to run.  There you go.  There we go.  Okay.  Get some ropes. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  The dartboard is set.  Ivy from Privileged Gentleman's Club.  Go check her out.  23rd and 11th.  She's really hot.  A hot blonde.  Helps us out with a lot of things here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Okay.  Stinky, you ready down there with the darts?  Yep.  Yep.  Stinky's eating half the fluff.  Ah, it's good.  Okay.  Fluff rules when you're stoned.  We're getting some last-minute pictures.  There we go.  Steve from foundrymusic.com is filming.  And up first, why don't we start from the bottom up again? 
[02:14:30]  All right.  I mean, from the bottom up for the finals.  Jerome from Boston will be first.  Let's get Jerome up here.  Nice.  Jerome, you can pick out your cherry darts or have Stinky hand you one.  I'm doing a good job trying to do this.  It's a slow roller to first.  It's behind the bag!  Sorry.  Watch the feet.  Jerome, any thoughts?  Any thoughts?  You came all the way from Boston for this.  Yeah, but I'm originally from White Plains.  Oh.  Oh.  That's not...  I'm just going to squeeze.  All right. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  That's cool.  All right.  Here you go.  His first start in the finals.  First of three.  First of three.  Get ready to mark, Rick.  It's the final.  Oh.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  That was pretty good.  That is very close.  Rick, how many inches from the bullseye?  At least an inch and a half.  Hey, don't you have a Sharpie we can initial it with?  Yeah, you need to put a Sharpie or something.  Put his initials right there.  Really small.  Make sure you put a dot.  Put a dot. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  There you go.  There's the dot.  All right.  There's the first mark.  Very good.  Okay.  And very close, by the way.  He still has two shots left, Anthony.  Let's see if he can improve.  No.  No.  Might as well not mark where they fall short of his last shot.  And Jerome's final cherry dart.  That's going to be tough to beat, though.  Come on.  Very tough to beat.  He is three inches away from the bullseye, from cork, as they call it.  That's less than three.  Cork.  That's less than three, bro. 
[02:16:00]  No.  That's three inches.  Oh.  And that one came up short.  But his first throw.  Can I call it the money shot?  Yeah.  Yes.  The first throw ended up being a great shot.  How many inches is that, Rick?  That's less than two, dude.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Stop it.  And you want to go off?  From that, um, from that.  From the fro?  No.  I'm talking from the goddamn bullseye.  You know what the bullseye is.  Rick's not listening, man.  That's closer to three.  It's, I would say. 
[02:16:30]  Closer to three.  You get a tape measure.  I would say that's three inches.  We said we're going to the, uh, you know.  Rick doesn't listen.  He just doesn't listen.  I know.  It's not from there.  I don't have a headphone on.  The bullseye is, you know what we're talking about, what the bullseye is.  It's what you would think the bullseye is.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, I guess, I guess you're right.  It's closer to three inches.  Yeah.  It's three inches away from the bullseye.  My goodness.  Okay.  All right.  Up next, Anthony, is Colin.  All right, Colin, step right up. 
[02:17:00]  Grab your first of the three cherries you will be throwing.  This is for the Xbox.  Here he goes.  That first shot.  Wow, that is going to be hard to beat.  Any thoughts, Colin, as you get ready here?  I can't believe you got it there.  Yeah, that was a pretty good throw.  That's going to be really tough to beat.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Here's Colin's first shot from Brooklyn.  Represent.  Here he goes.  Oh, okay.  Not too shabby.  Probably six to seven, right?  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Six to seven inches away.  Doesn't quite make it, though.  Jerome for Boston, still in the lead.  Here's Colin's second throw.  Oh, way off to the left.  Total miss.  Took out her knee.  And Colin's final shot for the Xbox.  Here it comes.  You've got to get that thing.  Really line it up.  Concentrate.  Think about that.  Be the cherry.  Be the cherry.  Oh, did he get a booby prize? 
[02:18:00]  Did it hit?  Did he get the booby prize?  Did it hit you?  No.  All right.  Thank you very much, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Well, no problem.  Thank you.  Let's hear it for Colin.  Colin, great job.  You made the finals.  But Boston's first throw there.  Man, that is really going to be tough to beat.  Yeah, Jerome's still in the lead.  Let's go with the wow sign, guys.  Scott.  Woo!  Scott, any thoughts?  Yeah, Ronal.  Ronal!  You gave up a DVD for a chance at the, a Samsung DVD player for the Xbox. 
[02:18:30]  So, here we go.  There he goes.  Really lubing those fingers up.  Here goes Scott.  First throw.  Oh.  Okay.  But short.  Northeast of the bullseye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here comes shot number two.  He's not taking much time.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What a great day.  He just threw, ladies and gentlemen, a perfect bullseye.  A perfect bullseye.  I don't think we've ever seen this in this game. 
[02:19:00]  And considering we've never seen it.  Wow.  Nothing close.  That is an exact bullseye.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Right there.  That is an exact bullseye.  Right there.  Let's just put it this way.  We should be playing the Caddyshack clip right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is nice.  It looks like a run.  It's a run.  Oh, my God.  Can I get one more shot?  What?  Yeah.  You can.  Can I go for the press prize now?  No.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you have.  This is your last start.  You can go for the booby prize.  Sure.  Earl's oblivious back then.  Let's go with Earl.  Oh, man.  A total miss.  But let me tell you, that second shot, a complete and total bullseye.  Did we get that on video?  Yeah.  All right.  We got that on video.  Ivy, what were you thinking when you hit the bullseye?  Well, I've definitely never been hit like that.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Most of the girls have been with say that.  That's great. 
[02:20:00]  So that was bullseye.  She had a surprise look.  The cherry tasted good.  Yeah, we all did.  She had a surprise look on her face.  I saw it.  It was almost one of those slow motion things.  As it arced through the air, I'm like, it's going to go.  And it did.  Wow.  Totally tough to beat.  The only thing anyone could hope for now is a tie and then a throw-off.  A throw-off.  We almost lost that cherry.  She'd be called like 20 basketball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Almost.  She almost lost that cherry.  And she ate it.  Look at it. 
[02:20:30]  You ate it, huh?  What a trooper.  Considering what's going on today.  Okay.  Sean, you're next.  Sean was the one that defaced the other radio station's billboard from New Jersey.  Sean, any thoughts?  I mean, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  How do you now follow this?  Playing for second place.  How do you follow this?  He's going to play for second place.  You've got to go right there.  Go for the bullseye.  Go for the bullseye.  Here he goes.  Stepping up to that line.  That's okay.  Stepping up to that line.  Here goes Sean.  Going for the throw. 
[02:21:00]  No.  He hit them.  No.  Off the leg.  Off the leg, though, right?  What?  Yeah, off the leg.  Yeah, but you mark there.  It was southeast of the target, Anthony.  Here you go.  You're going to have to arc it a little more, I think.  All right.  Here goes Sean's second shot.  There it is.  Cherry darts for the Xbox.  Oh.  Again, he's pulling that thing to the right.  He's cursing.  They're dumping out.  All right.  Here goes Sean's third shot.  Here it is.  Oh, now very good. 
[02:21:30]  He had a good line there, but his distance was a little off.  Ivy, how are you doing?  Great.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Up next is Roger.  He's in the 13th grade at Suffolk Community College.  Yeah.  He loves it over there.  Roger, any thoughts?  Got to win.  Got to win.  I got to hit it.  I don't know.  All right.  You are a pitcher, right?  Yeah.  He's a pitcher, Anthony. 
[02:22:00]  He's a pitcher.  All right.  You got three shots to get in it right in the strike zone.  Here he goes.  He's taking his time.  He's concentrating.  He's preparing the cherry.  And he throws to first.  And here he goes.  First shot.  Oh, pretty good.  Pretty good style.  He's got that direct line in there.  Hit the...  No lobbing.  Hit the inner part of the...  Yeah, the target area to the right.  Okay, here's Roger's second shot at the dartboard. 
[02:22:30]  Here he goes.  He's really clearing that fluff off of there to get a better grip.  And...  Oh, that one way short.  Very low.  Down for ball two.  Here he goes.  He's really taking his time, Opie.  It's almost annoying.  It's bordering on annoying.  As he steps up to the line.  And here he goes.  Third shot.  Oh!  No, that was... 
[02:23:00]  Northeast of the target about...  Yeah.  Give it, I don't know, four or five inches away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Our final contestant.  Here it is.  We're down to this.  And it's looking pretty grim, considering that bullseye shot we just saw moments ago.  This is Frank from Philly.  Frank, who lives by the mall, any final thoughts?  Trip to the stairwell.  I'm ready to go.  All right.  Yeah, that'll always help out the accuracy.  Yeah.  Sure. 
[02:23:30]  Well, let's wait and see, Ed.  Here we go.  Here you go.  Here you go.  The first shot.  Oh!  That was so close.  That is really close.  You know, that would...  He just claimed second place.  That would have...  He's at least a half inch.  That would have been a winning shot.  Half inch away from the bullseye.  That would have been a winning shot.  Let's see if he could follow it up.  Walk it in, as they say in darts.  All right.  Here he goes.  Frank's second shot from Philly.  Setting up.  Oh, see a little fluff got on his finger there. 
[02:24:00]  Pulled it off to the left.  And it was a little short.  And finally.  Here's his last shot.  This is the last shot.  If Frank doesn't hit the bullseye directly, Scott will win the Xbox.  Oh!  Again.  No good.  Again, he hit around the outside.  He was about an inch away, Anthony.  He hit about the same spot he hit on that first throw.  Let's hear it for Frank.  Yeah.  And let's hear it for Scott, the winner of the Xbox. 
[02:24:30]  Unbelievable.  Scott, what a shot.  Come here.  If we could get Scott over here for a second.  Scott, what were you thinking when that left your hand and you saw?  When did you know it was going to be a bullseye?  When it hit, actually.  When it hit or when it left your hand, did you think in that slow motion scene as it  arced its way over to the bullseye, did you think, oh, my God, this is going?  No, I prayed to God.  You didn't, because I kind of saw from here.  I was like, wow, that is a perfect throw.  I've been practicing all day.  I was taking little pieces of sheetrock and throwing them at walls. 
[02:25:00]  That'll do, yeah.  Well, that'll work.  I guess that's what did it.  Oh, that helps.  And you just laid it right into the bullseye.  Fantastic.  I think she, I went and smoked a cigarette with her before.  I think she gave me good luck.  Oh, is that what you did?  Yeah.  How about that?  I usually rub on people pretty good, so.  To study the target area?  That one happened?  I had to crawl under the foos.  He got the lay of the land.  The lay of the land.  All right, let's hear it for Scott.  He's got the Xbox.  Very good.  Any final shout-outs or anything, Scott? 
[02:25:30]  Um, no, not really.  You better mention your drunk friends right here.  Oh, yeah, to my friends here, Matt and Steve.  Right.  And to my best friends right here.  Yeah.  There it is.  There it is.  I feel like a hug.  He's got his Xbox.  There's the Xbox.  Girl Pug.  And Ivy, any thoughts?  Of course not.  Wow, we actually had an Xbox to give away?  Jesus.  Nothing at all, O.  Ivy, nothing?  Nothing happening in there?  Oh, no, you guys just crack me up, and I hope you keep on cracking me up. 
[02:26:00]  You guys are the best radio DJ hosts I've ever, you know, heard in my life, so keep doing it.  Great.  Finally a thought from that head of Rose Anthony.  Thank you.  Let's hear it for Ivy from Privileged Gentleman's Club.  Yeah.  23rd and 11th here in Manhattan.  You know what's funny?  She can't even remember when there was a cherry there last.  Hey, with that, we'll take a quick break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Cara M. Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:26:30]  I'd rather hear my penis in a place than listen to those jokes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Yeah, where the hell's my Sam, man?  I need my Sam.  Sam Adams and Project Greenlight, they share similar philosophies.  Fostering and supporting independent thinking and creative excellence.  Sam Adams Brew It Yourself TV commercial contest.  Look at what that wacky Jim Cook is up to now.  Write your own Sam Adams commercial.  30-second spot.  And you submit it to projectgreenlight.com. 
[02:27:00]  And then you review six other competing entries.  And you've got a chance to win.  You work with the famous director, Chris Moore.  And you have a chance to win $5,000 in a year supply of Sam Adams beer.  There you go.  Go to projectgreenlight.com.  Contest begins November 26th.

That was a feel money.  I don't know why.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I did nothing. 
[02:27:30]  I think someone else needs a Sam Adams.  Yeah, grab one.  I want one right now.  Sam Adams.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers to give out in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-277-4.  Wow.  I must say, I think the cherry darts for the Xbox was a huge success, Anthony. 
[02:28:00]  A lot of fun.  It had everything a great sporting event should have.  It had that build-up.  And then the Grand Slam home run kind of thing that happened.  When he had that bullseye, the place just came apart.  It was like Mark McGuire swinging that last home run.  He made Barry Bonds like, unfortunately, the last game of the World Series.  It was one of those moments, O.B.  I had a tear in my eye. 
[02:28:30]  I had to dab it a little bit.  I just felt I was part of history here at this station today.  That was unbelievable, though.  I'll never forget it.  Dead on.  I would say it's probably one of the biggest events to happen in New York this year.  Thank you.  I hope it sounded like something out there.  I think it did, though.  I say, who cares?  It definitely had some drama.  Yeah, it did.  A lot of drama.  And someone walked away with an Xbox.  And someone walked away with a sticky box.  If I could say that. 
[02:29:00]  And boy, that Ivy, huh?  Ivy always a trooper.  Did you see her just there?  As the target.  Having cherries thrown at her.  What else is she going to do?  Dance and make a lot of money?  I don't know why these girls are down here showing their wares for free.  Well, now we can tell everyone that Ivy dances at Privileged Gentleman's Club, 23rd and 11th in Manhattan.  And now you can go in there and go, wow, you were the chick on the O&A show and you were the human dartboard.  She is put together nice.  I knew she had to dance. 
[02:29:30]  Throw cherries covered with fluff.  No, don't throw anything at her.  Money.  Money.  Throw money at her.  Yeah, she wants you to throw money at her.  I knew that Sharpie wasn't going to come off of her either.  Now, we've done some signings and stuff.  And when you get a little bit of Sharpie on your finger, like three days later, you're just going, what the hell?  Can this stuff come off?  And yes, I do bathe occasionally.  So it's not that.  But she's going to have an X and initials on certain parts of her as she's trying to earn her keep. 
[02:30:00]  Is Ivy putting her clothes back on?  Is she dressed?  She's actually having a lot of trouble with the fluff.  Bring her in here.  Because it's hard.  Let's get her in here.  Tell her to use warm water.  It'll come right off.  Warm water.  Or warm saliva and the abrasive nature of a tongue usually helps, too, if anyone wants to volunteer for that.  I would volunteer in a heartbeat.  You would?  I don't know.  Well, Anthony, we've got to set up for our next thing that's happening on the show. 
[02:30:30]  I'm so happy about this because it involves patriotism.  Hey, Ivy, what's up?  Ivy, how you doing?  Hey, you got your clothes back on.  What's up with that?  We saw you across the room.  You look different with your clothes on.  Yeah.  Should I take them off again?  Yeah.  By all means.  Yeah.  Did you get the lipstick off of you?  No, not quite.  I don't know if you guys are using Cody or Mac or what, but...  Yeah, we know. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  We don't know.  Let's sing.  But now you can show the guys when you're dancing today, like, look, look, here's where the lipstick was.  Rachel was coming in the door at the time she was bending over to take some of her garments off,  and that handle of the door will never be the same when you touch it.  It's getting hot in there, Peppy.  A little hot in here, yeah.  Is she going to get naked with me for once or what?  Who?  You guys.  All right, yeah, let's all get naked.  What the hell?  Anthony, why don't you just start it off?  Come on, guys.  Come on. 
[02:31:30]  Anybody want to get naked with Ivy?  Might as well just throw it out there.  Anyone.  Peppy from the Good Rats.  Yeah, I want to.  Peppy, Marcella.  My sons are here.  Number two, it'll get you guys all sick if I got naked.  Ivy, it's all you, I guess.  I've got my name Peppy written in here.  Peppy.  I don't have any jokes anymore.  I haven't talked to my mom lately, so...  Oh, you don't have any jokes today.  That's too bad.  Yeah, that's why we had you in here.  Let's see.  Now, let's see.  Make sure all that lipstick came off.  Try not to talk. 
[02:32:00]  Let me see the lipstick.  Go ahead.  Let me...  Okay.  Now, is that all lipstick?  Hey, Ivy, are you going to help us out with our...  I know it's that time.  Are you going to help us out with our new thing we're starting tomorrow?  Ooh.  How about that?  Shave the bush for Bush?  Nice.  You see what we're doing?  Do you know about the...  You know, I went to school.  ...Taliban.  No.  No clue about it.  You don't know what the Taliban is?  Do you know...  All right, hold on.  Let's ask her.  Let me...  You know something?  This would be such a cool way to go through life. 
[02:32:30]  Just skipping through life with your shoelaces untied.  Do you know what the Taliban is?  I'm going to go...  Yeah, I know what the Taliban is.  What is it?  It's a bunch of those suckers in Afghanistan who like Osama bin Laden a lot, and we're trying  to kill them.  Very good.  Oh, there you go.  Give her a bell.  That's very good.  Beautiful and educated.  Now, yeah.  What a combination.  Now, you know what the Taliban is.  Okay.  Now, do you know what's going on over there?  Do you know what the Northern Alliance is?  They push back as far as Kabul, and they're trying to get Karan Harari. 
[02:33:00]  Okay, let's go on.  That's good.  That's good.  That's good.  Yeah, I think she's MSNBC.  Yeah, that material.  Material.  I'd like to see her instead of that other one they have on.  The one that went to...  Yeah, we'll see her on that video phone.  Cheesy video.  And ask her in Afghanistan.  All right.  Let's see.  What are the Northern Alliance and the people in Afghanistan doing, one of the things they're  doing, to celebrate the Taliban being out of Kabul? 
[02:33:30]  As far as I knew, they were going through and taking, like, all the leftovers and killing  them and throwing them in stitches.  That's how they sell me.  Killing, always funny.  You know?  According to Ivy.  You say potato, I say potato, whatever.  Oh, wow.  I have no clue what that means.  Well, you know what they're doing?  They're shaving off their beards.  Oh, okay, yeah.  I saw this one news ad, too, where they had, like, all these pictures of all these, like,  scans we've had moving all over the barbershops and stuff.  They're like, woo-hoo!  You can't say them. 
[02:34:00]  Hold on.  That's what it is.  You can see them, but you can't say them.  You can't see them as close as they get to seeing them anyways.  Right, right.  You just can't say it on the air.  Anthony, don't you think that if they took a picture of her like this and they put it  outside the caves, those guys would all come out for the win?  Of course they would.  They'd come running.  I think that's what they ought to do.  They wouldn't know what it is.  The turbans would pop off their heads.  For those people in radio, a face is so pretty, I haven't really...  You.  Yeah, that's one of...  Yeah, you can't say that one.  That's one of the seven dirty words.  Right.  What are the other six? 
[02:34:30]  Let me get them out of the way.  Well, just so we can point on her body.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yes.  Lovely breasts.  A lovely breast.  I think, Anthony, you should call Mom.  I'm getting engaged.  Oh, by the way, hi, Mom.  Hi, Dad.  That's always...  They're still alive?  Hi, Dad.  Cool.  Now, what they're doing...  Yeah, they're shaving their beards because the Taliban would want all the men to have  the big, bushy beards.  Yeah, it was that four-inch rule or something.  And they...  Yeah.  Whatever. 
[02:35:00]  Make your own joke.  And then...  I said make your own joke at home.  Go ahead.  The four-inch joke.  I'm not...  She's making silly faces at you.  I see that.  Doesn't even matter.  You remember my three-inch for you?  I heard you were three inches from the ground.  From the ground.  I don't remember that.  Anyway.  I thought when I said it at first, you're like face-flushed and you're like, what?  What?  And I'm like, why do I wait from the ground?  Hey, bring in the stoner chick, Jen.  She would enjoy this banter. 
[02:35:30]  You're a hot...  Anyway, tomorrow...  Hey, there's the stoner chick.  Hey, what's up?  All right, go ahead, Ann.  I'm sorry.  To celebrate the liberation there in Kabul.  That guy.  The people shaving their beards off.  We're going to celebrate here by shaving other beards off.  The bearded oyster.  The bearded clam.  Whatever you want to call it.  We will be shaving tomorrow. 
[02:36:00]  So would you like to come down and celebrate with us by shaving?  To show your...  And have yourself shaved to show your support for the cause.  Yeah.  Shave your bush for bush.  What time should I show up?  Well, how about 3-0-1?  All right.  You want to show up tomorrow?  Sure, that would be great.  Now, I'm looking...  Without describing anything, let's not talk about anything.  Everyone knows what we're talking about.  Are you used to having that like that?  Pretty much.  I like having a little toupee, you know.  A little... 
[02:36:30]  What they call the landing strip.  Yeah.  That's good.  Well, mine's a little bit more than that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, just a little...  Like you said the last time, a brillo pad.  Oh, did I say that?  Yeah, you did.  I must have been on some hallucinogenic narcotics.  But that's good.  And you won't have that string with you, will you?  Wow.  Why is she giving you the finger, Anthony?  I don't know.  Perhaps she uses an OB that doesn't need an applicator, and she's showing me the finger.  No, you won't be... 
[02:37:00]  Well, we were informed earlier that it might have been that season.  Nice to know that you're in sync with my feminine cycle.  I like that.  Hey, let me tell you something.  Our bodies are so...  Let me tell you something.  It doesn't bother me at all.  I'm one of the few here that have said, I don't care what time it is like that.  I'm into the crime scene sex.  It's the crime scene sex.  I don't care if after you're done, you've got to put that yellow police tape up around your bed.  All right.  So, she's going to come down tomorrow and do it, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  Very good.  Very good.  And we're encouraging all the ladies to just show up tomorrow.  You don't have to call and say you're coming.  Just get down here tomorrow.  Just show up.  And some guy, I think he's on the line.  He's making t-shirts, Anthony, for this.  Sal, what's up?  O.P., Anthony, how you doing?  All right, Sal.  I'm bringing in the t-shirts tomorrow for you guys.  All right.  What will the t-shirts say?  It will say, like, in the back, it's going to be a big, wow, O.P. and Anthony, WNAW,  1027.  Yeah.  In the front, there's going to be shaving bush for bush, a picture of a bush, and a shaver 
[02:38:00]  on one side of the picture.  On your radio doll.  Oh.  Just have it say, you know, shave your bush for bush.  Don't make it too busy.  Yeah, don't make it too busy with little cute caricatures and stuff.  All right, whatever you guys want.  I'll bring it in tomorrow around 3, 84 o'clock.  All right, cool, Sal.  All right, see you, Don.  All right, make it look good.  All right.  There you go.  So ladies, just show up tomorrow.  We have at least 10 that are scheduled.  Oh, I can't wait.  What a patriotic day.  What a day to be an American. 
[02:38:30]  Ladies, how'd you do, stoner chick?  Not so well.  You kind of cheesed out of the competition.  I definitely did.  I think if I had a redo, I would hit the money shot.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why are you crossing your arms?  You look fine.  Yeah.  You're trying to cover up your book.  You're nice.  She's all right.  Look at that.  Are you intimidated by Ivy?  A little bit.  Why?  I don't know.  Girls come in all sizes and shapes.  It's fantastic.  I don't pick puppies or anything. 
[02:39:00]  Wow.  Why are you intimidated by her?  I don't know.  What?  You look great.  You really think so?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Definitely.  There you go.  It's all right.  No, it's cool.  We all have nipples here.  Ivy's trying to get her to take her clothes off.  And no one was really jumping in to stop her either.  Yeah, what the hell?  She looks like she has a great pair.  Come on, guys. 
[02:39:30]  She really does.  Rousing applause from everybody.  She's just feeling a little shy.  Right, Jen?  Yeah.  I don't want my loser boyfriend to be mad at me.  That's all.  That pesky boyfriend thing.  He's a loser, though.  Yeah, but he's nice.  Yeah.  And he's hung like a mule, you know.  Damn.  Listen to that.  Can't give that up.  Forget the fact that he lives at home, sleeps on his parents' couch, as long as he's got  the mule. 
[02:40:00]  That's great.  All right.  Well, thank you for participating.  And we'll keep the naked girl around for a while, though.  I'm wild, sorry.  Can I have a beer?  Yeah, you can have a beer.  Okay, cool.  You can.  Oh, my God.  Let's go.  I want to see her open it.  She's just striking me like a completely naked Heather Graham standing in front of me.  You think so?  Yeah.  Yeah, you got some Heather Graham in you.  Definitely.  What, you don't like that?  You don't like that?  I don't look like her.  No, I'm here. 
[02:40:30]  Yes, you do, and it's a good thing.  And I'm seeing that a little bit now that you mention it.  Thank you.  No doubt.  That's good.  Very good thing.  Hi, I'm Joseph.  Oh, hey, Joe.  Joe's hugging the naked girl.  Yeah.  That's great.  That's always good for relationships.  I'm done now.  That's always good for relationships, yeah.  Did you know that my brother is a famous radio star?  He is?  I think you're talking to me.  All right.  Well, we can play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:41:00]  Yes, it was an educational program today.  You guys are all traveling to Rochester tonight?  Yes.  Yes, we are.  Where are you going?  It's the Good Rats.  We're going to Fat Moe's up in Rochester.  We're playing two nights, Friday and Saturday.  How did Joe get in the Good Rats?  Go ahead, Pep.  You field this question.  How did I get in the Good Rats?  He was the last one to apply.  Well, yeah.  Growing up and all the bands along the way.  Here's a gig where you have to play three hours a night, drive ten hours to a gig for 
[02:41:30]  very little money and the worst van in the world.  You know, never have really girls at our shows.  I'll tell you, this sounds better than my life now.  It's a big sausage fest.  Much like a road show, yes.  Yeah, I understand.  We have a great time.  You know us.  We always had great players.  I mean, you know, I can say that we always had the best musicians around.  There's been 147 people in this band.  It's like the final tab.  The major problem, the reason we had to settle on Joe was that I have a third son, Spencer, 
[02:42:00]  who doesn't want to play.  Otherwise, I'd have my other son in the band and it'd be a whole family.  A little nepotism.  I got a couple of grandchildren, but they're not ready yet.  Yeah, we're doing Weezer's show, too.  Are you?  Very cool.  Tomorrow morning?  Cool.  8.30.  You guys will probably hear this on your way to Rochester.  That would be great.  Tell you the truth.  I swear to God.  That would be very cool.  All right, guys.  Have fun.  Say hi to Weez.  Have a blast.  All right, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for having us on such a busy day.  Yeah, very busy day today.  I'll tell you what.  It was worth the three-hour ride getting here. 
[02:42:30]  I'm 41 miles away.  Thanks, guys.  And thank you.  Take it on me, Rod.  I love on you.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  Got to step in line.  Why don't we go to the phones and see what's going on here?  John, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I learned a couple things.  Tower Band apparently are some suckers in Afghanistan that like Otara Bin Laden and Anthony Baines occasionally.  And he's also in touch with Ivy Seven inside.  Yes.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you, John. 
[02:43:00]  Now it's mine.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  All right.  Hey.  Fun show.  Thanks a lot.  Oh, cool.  Hey, I learned two interesting things about Anthony today.  Yes.  I learned that he had man-sized junk for a day.  And I learned that sometimes he just has to lay there and take it.  Later, guys.  Very good, buddy.  Funny I don't quite remember it sounding like that when I said it.  Take the pain.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's happening?  What's up, folks?  Good, good.  I hear you're doing something patriotic tomorrow.  You can also do something patriotic tonight.  Oh, no.  In Staten Island, there is going to be a benefit for the orphans. 
[02:43:30]  Hey, Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  You can say hi first.  Oh, I'm sorry.  How you been?  Well, you guys are always pressed by time.  Yeah, and, Foote, you have some nerve.  Why don't you plug the show at Sgt. Pepper's next Wednesday night?  Now everyone's thoroughly confused.  All right, Joe.  There's a benefit tonight.  Yeah.  At Sharky's in Staten Island.  All right.  Okay.  It's going to benefit the widows and orphans of the fire department and the police, a really cool cause.  Yes.  It's 8 o'clock and a 10.30 show.  It's on 1221 Bay Street in Staten Island. 
[02:44:00]  And the donations are 25 bucks.  And if you want to call the place for a reservation, it's 718-390-0339.  And the talent, Joseph Anthony, Pete Michaels, Davin, and me, myself, Mr. Joseph T. Curry.  All right.  And now for the shameless plug.  Me and Rob Falcone at the brokerage tomorrow and Saturday.  Why don't you stay home and practice keyboards?  I am practicing.  And don't forget, Sgt. Pepper's Wednesday.  I am totally confused. 
[02:44:30]  See, you don't know how to plug.  Was Foote just on the phone?  You've got to give one plug per plug.  Okay.  It's very difficult.  I will...  Shame on me.  And I will default to the benefit.  Thank you, Joe Curry.  See you later, my pal.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There goes Foote.  Completely confusing everybody.  See, you know what it is?  Everyone that plugs on this show usually knows the protocol.  You give your one plug.  If you give two, people will go, what?  I'm at the brokerage in Staten Island.  You know, they get confused.  I was just goofing on them. 
[02:45:00]  One plug.  Adam, what's going on?  I learned in the electronic store.  I learned in the electronic stores in Afghanistan are called Crazy Mohameds.  Yeah.  Very good.  You guys stink.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean, what did you learn on this mess of a show?  Hey, guys.  I learned that killing is always funny, according to Ivy.  John, what's going on?  I learned Anthony doesn't care if you have to put up the crime scene tape. 
[02:45:30]  And Stoner Chick's intimidated by Ivy.  They love the uh-huh-huh-huh.  Where is Stoner Chick?  She didn't have to leave.  Ray, what's up?  Yeah, I learned three things today.  All right.  Rick never listens.  Yeah.  Ivy's not as dumb as she.  Oh.  I have to.  Oh, Ray.  Dude.  What are you saying?  Ray, you ruined it.  It didn't make it.  Oh, you can't say that.  He hit the bullseye.  Let's just say that.  Dan from Hoboken, I learned musicians can't plug like comedians. 
[02:46:00]  That's true.  Dave from Philly, what did you learn, man?  You know, O&A.  Hey.  Yeah, I learned that Paul Williams is an alcoholic.  Yeah.  Alcoholic.  And that quitters never win.  He should have stayed a drunk.  Maybe he'd write some better songs.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Hey, thanks, O&A.  You got stuck.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Norm.  Norm, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that slippery is always good. 
[02:46:30]  Yes.  I think he's not good.  Yes.  And I learned that Anthony likes Ivy a lot more when she's not talking.  Don't.  We weren't supposed to hear that.  Ken, what's up?  That sucks.  Hey, guys.  I learned that going to the stairwell increases accuracy.  Yeah.  Scott did say that before he threw that dark.  Remember?  Thank God we don't drug test here in our competitions.  Hey, Jesus still has a one in Xbox.  Hey, whenever you have a hot girl on the show, the kite string is always flying. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Let's go to Anna.  Anna, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Pretty good.  I learned today that you guys did the first exorcism with Andy Cain with Preparation H.  Always funny.  Always funny.  Oh, that's all.  And that's it?  Yeah.  See?  She hung up.  She bailed out.  Ah, Chris.  What's going on?  I learned Obi didn't get a daily Chuck Webner reference in today.  Well, the bullseye on Ivy looked like Chuck Webner's face after Allie was through with him. 
[02:47:30]  How's that?  Great.  Because Rick had to color it all in and it looked kind of weird and stuff.  Thank you.  Okay.  I think we're just about done.  All right.  Josh, what's up?  Josh?  What's up to you guys?  Huh?  What?  What?  You guys pick up any real and strong?  Oh, you're breaking up.  Your phone sucks.  Who wants to talk about Britney Spears on the latest issue of Rolling Stone?  Yeah, what they put her on again? 
[02:48:00]  She looks unbelievable though.  Check this out.  Let me see.  Let me see.  But I think they enhanced her boobs.  Let me see.  What do you mean enhanced?  Oh, my God.  I don't think they're that big.  She's dreamy.  Slut.  Jersey Gary Anthony.  That says TF all over it, doesn't it?  And then that's what she's trying to say.  Waka, waka, waka.  You know what that means, right?  You ever guys ask you for the TF?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I bet.  That would fit.  And what do you say to them? 
[02:48:30]  TF the...  It depends on if they can make the true pearl necklace come out or not, you know.  TF the bottle.  Let me see.  Show me your style.  TF that bottle.  Here, wait.  This one.  Go ahead.  All right.  Let Joe...  Yeah, you hold him and let Joe TF.  Oh, look how cute this is.  Wow, that would be good.  Oh, my God.  She's got good form.  Hey, Stoner Jen.  Stoner Jen is really freaking out.  The bottom is warm.  All right, wait.  Get Stoner Jen on the mic.  What's wrong, Stoner Jen?  Give her the mic.  Wait, give her the mic.  What?  I'm just chilling.  Just chilling.  Yeah, but you looked horrified when she was doing that. 
[02:49:00]  I'm sorry.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Your boyfriend liked the TF?  No?  A plea in the fifth.  Is he like, my parents aren't home.  Let's get a TF in.  No?  No.  All right.  Just curious.  My parents are going to come home in an hour.  Quick TF.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, I went to tell you that drinking is not a sickness. 
[02:49:30]  That's right.  We told Paul Williams, didn't we?  You were dead in bed.  All right, Dave.  Thanks.  I think you were doing a little Paul.  And finally, Andy will wrap it up today.  Andy, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Lucifer's a major pussy.  Lucifer?  Yes.  Yeah, yes.  And Stoner Chick rules.  Hell yeah.  You like Stoner Chick.  You've got to have her on there all the time.  We'll have her on.  Thank you.  And we've got to get out of here.  Yes.  Good rats.  Thank you, Brother Joe.  Thank you, Ivy from Privileged Gentleman's Club, 23rd and 11th in Manhattan. 
[02:50:00]  Thank you, Stoner Chick.  Thank you.  And Scott, the winner of the Xbox.  Thank you.  Great job.  Thank you.  Have fun in Rochester.  And tomorrow, Anthony, our campaign starts.  Yes.  Shave your bush for bush.  I can't wait.  To show your patriotism to America, ladies.  I can't wait.  All you have to do is show up down here at the station tomorrow between 3 and 7.  We'll do the rest.  Okay?  Right.  Peace.  Don't be an a-hole. 
[02:50:30]  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, Bucky.  Go after yourself, Bucky. </pre>
