<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the usual repeated announcement of its start, followed by the hosts’ characteristically rambling banter, referencing 50 Cent, Larry King, and Mike Tyson in a nonsensical fashion.  They then tackled a lengthy, obsessive fan letter before pivoting to discuss their upcoming guests: Jake LaMotta, Patton Oswalt, and Russell Peters.  The hosts reminisced about LaMotta’s boxing career, comparing past fights to modern ones, and shared anecdotes about previous awkward guest experiences, particularly with John Cusack.  A significant portion of the early show was dedicated to a debate about the song "What Does the Fox Say?" by Ylvis, its popularity, and its comparison to Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe."  Sam’s birthday was celebrated with a sing-along of "What Does the Fox Say?", followed by an extended, graphically descriptive discussion of Jess Greenberg, a female musician known for her guitar covers and her appearance, that included attempts to find her contact information.  The show’s early segments concluded with discussions of a model helicopter accident, the hosts' continued fascination with Jess Greenberg, and an absurd arrest video from Australia.  They also promoted their podcast, highlighting the upcoming Bill Burr episode and its accessibility to those who'd canceled satellite radio.  A brief discussion about Samsung smartwatches and Pink Floyd, marked by E-Rock's strong dislike for the band, followed.

A humorous anecdote about a roommate's fondness for Pink Floyd segued into a discussion of E-Rock’s aversion to the band and the possibility of a parody song.  A call from Sammy Roberts celebrating his 30th birthday prompted reflections on aging.  This led to a discussion of a co-worker, Roland, known for his habit of wearing whichever sports team's apparel was currently popular.  This transitioned into a recollection of a previous show where they gave away New York Giants tickets, followed by a discussion of the infamous David Tyree catch in Super Bowl XLII and how its perception changed over time.  A host then recounted seeing a female NFL cheerleader's genitals on television, sparking a lengthy and vulgar discussion about cheerleaders and their attire.

The conversation shifted to a movie review of "The Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders," focusing on its poor acting and production values and then a bizarre cat training method offered by a listener.  This prompted discussion of one of the hosts’ own aggressive cat.  Patton Oswalt then joined the show. The conversation with Oswalt centered around a YouTube compilation of Opie and Anthony segments, specifically their critiques of Barry Williams’ Branson show and Yakov's Dinner Adventure. Oswalt commented on the absurdity and dark humor,  and then spoke about his early career struggles and living in a mold-infested apartment.  The segment ended with a discussion of the challenges of early careers in entertainment and managing finances.

Oswalt continued promoting his Adult Swim show, *The Heart She Holler*, and upcoming *Moby Dick* readings, discussing the graphic content of *Moby Dick* and his work in children’s animation. He also discussed his awkward early stand-up career.  Jake LaMotta and his wife then joined the show. The conversation shifted to LaMotta’s boxing career, relationships, and comedy performances. He shared anecdotes about his fights with Sugar Ray Robinson and his wives, punctuated by his dry humor and dark jokes. His wife interjected with details.  The segment ended with promotional information for LaMotta's appearances.

Further discussion of LaMotta's boxing career highlighted his tenacity and his cabaret act at age 91.  He spoke about his rivalry with Sugar Ray Robinson.  A humorous moment involved a host looking up LaMotta’s wife's skirt.  The conversation continued with discussions of the hosts’ experiences interviewing other boxers, including Sugar Ray Leonard, Mike Tyson, and Joe Frazier (including a clip of Frazier's incoherent performance of "Mustang Sally").  The discussion covered the physical toll of boxing, using UFC footage, and long-term health consequences for athletes, including the use of a taser for pain management.  A poker video showing a player's devastating loss and dramatic reaction was interpreted as a "soul death," leading to a discussion about death and a strange comparison to the Terminator.  Pink Floyd, and celebrity financial decisions (James Earl Jones and Star Wars, and David Cho's Facebook deal) were also discussed.  The segment concluded with discussion of LaMotta's upcoming performances and a birthday celebration for a show personality, followed by Bob Kelly’s arrival and discussion of his move to Westchester, NY, further banter, and more birthday greetings for Sam Roberts.

A "Bob and Sam" segment, focused on Sam Roberts’ birthday, featured numerous listener calls with birthday songs and crude jokes.  Discussions included the affluence of Armonk, NY, contrasted with low listener turnout; Bob Kelly's bizarre story about seeing his deceased mother-in-law; an argument about mic order; a caller's parody song; real estate commissions and cotton candy machines; Bob Kelly's move to Westchester; a birthday shout-out from CM Punk; and a lengthy discussion about engagement rings.  The show ended with more birthday calls, including one from a listener identifying as "Android Virus in New Mexico."

[00:05:00]  But Opie's motherfucking, Jimmy's trying to get blown.  And we come to play around and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah, on the edge of your chair.  Cause you really want to hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, 50, yeah.  Now Mike Tyson up in this bitch.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Booga, booga, booga.  Booga, booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Thank you, Larry King.  Thank you, 50 Cent.  And thank you, Mike Tyson.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Goodness gracious.  How's everyone doing?  All right.  We're back broadcasting to you, the people of America. 
[00:06:00]  I'd be better if I could read this letter.  What letter?  I got a piece of fan mail and I'm trying to sign a photo for this guy.  Fan mail from some flounder.  And he wrote it.  Now, I appreciate your fan mail, but it was written by, like, it's like a manifesto.  Oh, wow.  That's a little creepy.  Like a little tiny cursor.  OCD.  That's like OCD almost.  I'm lying.  That's a long letter, too, man.  It's a great person.  Yeah.  Long letter. 
[00:06:30]  You know, I thought we were before the show where Joe Compton was Jake LaMotta and I was  talking about Sugar Ray Robinson.  I was watching Sugar Ray Robinson footage and Travis said, who's he?  So I gave some shitty answer because I thought he was joking.  And it's like, you really never know who Sugar Ray Robinson was.  I was never a boxing fan.  No, but I mean, he just, I'm not sure.  Well, he's way before all of our times.  Yeah, so when you hear Sugar Ray, you think Leonard.  I think Leonard, yeah.  But Leonard got his name from Sugar Ray Robinson, right?  Yeah.  I'm just amazed.  We got Jake LaMotta coming in tonight. 
[00:07:00]  He's 92, 93.  I heard.  It's pretty good.  It'll be good.  It'll be good.  It's kind of rough.  I know who Jake LaMotta is.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  He's coming in.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have fun with him.  We'll have a blast.  He's doing comedy now.  Yeah, huh?  He's got jokes on jokes.  Jokes.  Jokes.  Does he do any jokes during interviews?  Yeah, he's got a, I don't want to blow his punchline.  It's just a sugar and diabetes joke to look forward to. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  I only know.  Why do you think he's going to say it a few times?  Well, I listened to him on Rod and Fez.  Could we have a game today?  Guess how many times he says the same thing?  Is it like the godfather of goth bet that we had?  When the Poe movie came out?  Cusack.  John Cusack.  Oh, was that awkward?  Remember that?  The first ten seconds of the interview. 
[00:08:00]  I forgot about that.  I was like, oh my God, enough.  And all he's been saying is the godfather of goth.  And then he comes in and.  John Cusack.  Said the line.  Said that it's the.  Edgar Allan Poe, yeah.  Edgar Allan Poe was really the godfather of goth.  It's like, oh.  We were just waiting for him.  And then he even fessed up to it.  He finally.  He was like, yeah, well, you know.  He'll never come back, unfortunately.  And I know he had a good time.  He was definitely cool.  But you know when these guys are one and done.  Right? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Meh.  So we got Jake LaMotta today.  We got Patton Oswalt.  And we got Russell Peters.  Nice.  Oh, is Russell here?  I didn't know that.  This is going to be an easy show.  It's going to be a real easy show.  Very cool.  I don't even want to say Jake LaMotta.  I want to say Jake LaMotta.  LaMotta.  LaMotta.  Watching that old time footage, man.  The way those fucking announcers talk.  Old timey.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  And LaMotta's in trouble.  Oh, man.  He's getting a pity.  Wouldn't you love to go back in time and go to one of those old school fights? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Where the whole arena is smoky.  Wearing suits.  Yeah.  Like gentlemen.  How cool would that be?  Amazing.  There was a picture posted on one of those history things on Twitter.  Yeah.  History pics and stuff like that of some boxing match from.  Oh, yeah.  I saw you tweet of that.  Oh, my God.  They were bloodied.  Like, just from head to toe, covered in blood.  It was one of those hundred round fights that they used to have.  Right.  Oh, God.  They're pretty much one of those guys to fight to the death. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  It's amazing what they...  Jake won 83 fights or something.  And back then they were like fucking 15 round.  Yeah.  You had to have your head knocked off before they stopped it.  And to watch Ray Robinson beating him.  And he went down once in his career.  It was like, I think his last fight.  And then...  Fucking animal.  Who was saying right before the show that he fought 20 times in one year?  20 times in 1941.  He fought 20 times.  Before we were even in World War II, he was fighting like 20 times. 
[00:10:00]  And then you're lucky to get these guys fighting once a year.  I know.  Once every, what, 18 months?  Maybe if you're lucky.  Yep.  Holy fuck.  He fought 20 times in one year.  I remember from Raging Bull, there was a line that the announcer did.  And I always remember in the movie.  And he said something about Ray and Jake.  And he goes, nobody else will fight them.  So they fight each other.  And here they fought three weeks apart.  Three weeks apart.  Three weeks apart.  Three weeks apart.  Not even healed. 
[00:10:30]  Recovered, yeah.  That's so fucked up.  He's a tough dude, obviously.  Watching him after the knockdown.  I forget the guy's name who knocked him down.  It was a final fight in Florida, I think.  Watching Jake stand there.  He had one.  His right hand was on the ring rope.  Because he was ready to go down again.  And just, he's trying to fight with his left hand.  And this guy is just beating him with both hands.  Because the guy was a younger mid-legger.  I think it was actually a, it might have been a light heavyweight.  And it was really fucking awesome to see how tough this fucking guy was, man.  What year did he tap out?  I want to say 51 or 52. 
[00:11:00]  Geez, really?  We have it written down.  Look at those guys.  It's, they're covered in blood.  Covered in blood.  Amazing.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Look at all this.  Everyone's got a hat on.  Everyone's got a fedora on.  Yeah, they all dressed like that.  It's either a fedora, one of those extra, extra, read all about it hats.  Where have you been?  It's coming back.  Strong.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I hate those.  It's unbelievable.  Fucking dumb hats.  Yeah, this picture looks like it happened yesterday in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  Nice.  1984, last fight.  Hey, really fast.  Everyone's talking about the Happy Days thing we did yesterday.  Oh, man.  And we're going to put that on the podcast next week.  Ooh.  Because a lot of people have been asking for it.  So, yes, that will be the podcast next week, which will come out on Wednesday.  This week's is the Bill Burr one, right?  Yeah, it's Bercentric.  Bill-centric.  Bill-centric.  Yeah.  Some of Bill's best moments from the Opie and Anthony shows on this week's Opie and Anthony  podcast.  Go get it, please. 
[00:12:00]  And spread the word we're doing a podcast, because I know there's a lot of people that  have tapped out of satellite radio just because they can't fucking afford it anymore.  Oh, man.  So, at least they'll get a little taste every week.  You know, we do an hour, hour and a half.  I think this week's is almost two hours.  It's pushing it.  It's pushing two hours.  But in general, it'll be about an hour, hour and 15 every week, right?  Yeah, more or less.  Yeah.  So, all right.  I think we should start with a sing-along today.  Yes.  You don't like this? 
[00:12:30]  No, not really.  I think not only should we start with a sing-along, I think we should play this a lot today.  Yeah, me too.  This is the hottest shit out there right now.  This should have been the Song of the Summer.  Yeah, they were dumb to put it out now.  Officially, it's Blurred Lines, by the way, I guess.  Yeah.  Who decided that?  Billboard.  Billboard decides what the official Song of the Summer is?  I mean, it definitely was.  Yeah?  Definitely.  All right.  But unquestionably.  Let me ask you this.  Okay.  What was the Song of the Summer last year? 
[00:13:00]  Oh.  Call Me Maybe.  You know it?  Yeah.  I called it from the beginning.  What was that song, Call Me Maybe?  Call Me Maybe.  Like Carly Rae Jepsen.  I made her famous on the after show.  You know, the broad that's about 35 and is making believe she's 20?  Yeah.  Exactly.  A little longer in the tooth than most.  Sure.  Exactly.  She's going to have that Tom Skerritt problem.  What happened?  She was just a kid.  I saw her, what?  I think it was one of those New Year's Eve shows.  Yeah.  I'm like, whoa. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, you're not supposed to have-  I thought she's supposed to be singing to the kids.  Box stars aren't supposed to have crows feet.  No.  What's going on?  She's been around a while and finally hit, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  Wow.  She's already fallen back off into, like, throwing out first pitches at random baseball games.  Oh, yeah.  She's done.  They're not even important games.  She's done.  Yeah, this is it for her.  Yeah.  You don't know this song?  Jimmy doesn't know this song.  I played it, like, 150 times on this channel.  Holy shit.  His song was huge. 
[00:14:00]  This was a massive song.  You're welcome.  You'll know the hook, Jimmy.  Come on.  No?  All right.  We're getting back to the hook in a second here.  I think it's really funny, though, that you're as shocked that I didn't know a song from last year as I am that you didn't know Sugar Ray Robinson.  Yeah.  I didn't know that one of our priorities are.  70 years ago.  You didn't know a song that was out eight months ago. 
[00:14:30]  That's kind of my point.  That's why we all need to work together.  We all have a little.  Yeah, it's a little knowledge for each other.  A little knowledge that we can pass along to each other.  Help each other out.  Right.  Yeah.  We're one big super brain.  There she is.  Yeah.  Do you have to make that face?  Scratching and clawing.  Is that your thing?  No, that's the call me maybe thing.  I know.  That's the phone to the ear, and I'm going, maybe?  Happy birthday, by the way.  You're too old for this stuff.  That's the phone to the ear.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're too old.  Congratulations. 
[00:15:00]  Exactly.  You're officially too old.  You know that, right?  That's Carly Rae Jepsen.  How old is Sam?  That's like when me and Opie had our arms around the silver chair, guys.  All right.  Yeah.  Great.  We could have been not only their fathers.  Exactly.  Oh, brother.  You are officially as old as I was when I came back to radio, satellite radio.  Oh, my God.  What?  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  See?  See how that happens?  What?  How did I catch up that quick?  That was fast.  Well, we've been here, what, nine years, I guess? 
[00:15:30]  So that's, yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  So now I'm pretty much as old as when I met you guys.  Oh, yeah.  As you were when I met you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Enjoy it.  That doesn't make sense.  It goes fast.  Is that why you're wearing your pink shirt and your, like, nice jeans and nice shoes?  You're all dressed for your birthday?  I've been wearing clothes like this for, like, a month.  Shut up.  Stop trying to change.  It's slacks.  He's trying to dress like a gentleman.  I know he is because he knows he's hitting 30 now.  He's starting to look at management positions.  Pink shirt.  That's, you know.  It's a statement. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pink is in for some reason.  It's a statement.  I tried it once.  It didn't work on the Oapster.  It didn't work on the Oapster.  Pinkster is not the Oapster's color.  Oh, God, no.  I don't know.  It's important that you try, though.  There's not many people or guys, I should say, that can pull off the pink.  I like a good pink shirt once in a while.  Not bad.  I tried.  I like a good pink sock.  Pink's a rough one, man.  That's a rough one.  Well, happy birthday, Sam.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[00:16:30]  Why don't we do a little sing-along for your birthday?  Yeah, I feel like this is the anthem of my birthday.  I don't think we even have to set it up.  I think we should just play it, man.  Yeah.  I think Anthony should appreciate this song.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it.  I was like, perfect.  Dog goes woo.  Cat goes meow.  Bird goes tweet.  And the mouse goes squeak. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Cow goes woo.  Frog goes crow.  And the elephant goes too.  Dogs say quack and fish go blow  And the sea goes ow, ow, ow  But there's no sound that no one knows  What does the fox say?  What the fox say? 
[00:17:30]  What the fox say?  Hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie, hattie  What the fox say?  Come on  What the fox say?  The blue eyes  Are we going through the second verse?  Oh, fuck yeah, man. It's catchy.  It's a real production. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, this guy ain't fucking around.  This thing is going to be huge.  Where is this from?  Norway.  Norway.  Norway.  Norway.  That makes perfect sense now.  Why?  Because they're fucking mental.  They're also, they're talk show hosts.  Oh, are they?  Yeah, and so they're making like a funny song.  How much meant to be silly though?  Yes.  Meant to be silly, meant to be catchy, and I'm telling you this thing is going to be everywhere within days.  Yeah.  It's already started, but...  Mashup will be playing it next week.  You think it's actually going to make like... 
[00:18:30]  Well, they'll play it like they play like the Friday song.  Play it ironically?  Like, yeah, no, like this is the viral video, but it's also catchy.  Ironically, but they also like it.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  I do.  You like it, Ed?  Oh, yeah.  It's one of my favorites.  Is Rich going to be jealous that he didn't come up with it?  He might be.  He tries a little too hard with his fucking parody songs.  Oh, I'd like to hear one.  Does he shoehorn?  Oh, he does a lot of them.  Rich does parody songs?  Oh, he thinks he has a great voice.  Can I hear some? 
[00:19:00]  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  I've never heard one.  Oh, yeah.  He's all in.  He writes those too, right?  Yeah.  Let's hear verse too.  You've got a little talent there, but he really enjoys doing them.  He enjoys a good parody, doesn't he?  Oh, boy.  We'll play this.  I'm sure I'll be able to find it on YouTube or something.  I hate radio guys with passion.  For anything.  Yeah, I know.  All right, back to the song.  Let's go.  Pointy nose, chasing mice and digging holes. 
[00:19:30]  Tiny paws up the hill.  Suddenly you're standing still.  Your fur is red, so beautiful.  Like an angel in disguise.  But if you meet a friendly host,  Will you communicate  by mo-o-o-o-o-os,  Mo-o-o-o-os,  Mo-o-o-o-os,  Mo-o-o-o-o-os.  How will you speak to that? 
[00:20:00]  Oh-o-o-o-os,  Oh-o-o-o-o-os,  Oh-o-o-o-os,  Oh-o-o-os.  What does the fox say?  What the fox say?  What the fox say?  What the fox say? 
[00:20:30]  What the fox say?  The secret of the fox  Ancient mystery  Somewhere deep in the woods  I know you're hiding  What is your sound?  Will we ever know? 
[00:21:00]  Will always be a mystery  What do you say?  Oh, I don't track that in there  You're like a living room  Hiding in the woods  What is your sound?  Will we ever know?  What the fuck?  Will we ever know? 
[00:21:30]  Baby, I've made them  What I've made them  What I've made them  To fox say  Baby, I've made them  Come on.  You like it.  That's huge.  Those are people in fox costumes.  Exactly, Chippa.  It already has 1.8 million views  Yeah, stop being a grouch  And admit that's hilarious  It's so fucking bad 
[00:22:00]  It's weird  I do like the little sounds  What does the fox say?  Yeah, we all know what the cat says  Like, this song theorizes that a cat  A fox sits in the woods going  Yes, it really is speculating  I want to rewrite this song and say  Mr. Kumiya, what do you say?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  I was thinking the E-Rock parody of that  What does the E-Rock say?  Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop 
[00:22:30]  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.  Yeah, what does E-Rock say?  It writes itself  Come on, let's do it  You'd appreciate that, right, E-Rock?  No, no, no  Of course not  What are you a grouch?  That's pretty catchy  So that's going to be big.  That's happening right now.  It's big already.  Last night, it was the Channel 11 news people had it on. 
[00:23:00]  The Fox?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they did like a quick.  Why are we playing it then if local news is?  Well, I think somebody on staff is a little ahead of the groove.  So ahead of the curve.  Yeah.  So they did that.  And then the weather woman was giving the weather.  And the green screen behind just turned into the video out of nowhere.  I started playing it, and everybody in the studio was laughing.  And I thought that was pretty funny.  But I was like, what the fuck is this?  It's a funny-ass song.  Oh, I see you pulled the chick with the big boobies there. 
[00:23:30]  I saw that last week.  Have you seen this girl yet?  Yes, last night.  Oh, good God.  It was the first time I saw her.  Can we put this shit on our Facebook page?  Because obviously we're doing some visual shit here.  I was stunned.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Your quote on Twitter was, Jesus fucking mother of piss, holy crap ass.  Have you seen this girl yet?  I just had to write down exactly what flew out of my mouth when I saw her.  Oh, my God.  She could be one of the hottest things on the internet right now. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Go full screen on that.  She's got 4.3 million views on her video.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  I know her.  You do?  Where's she from?  Uh, heaven.  Look at her tits bounce.  I didn't know this was the first time I went home.  Oh.  Oh.  I'd love to do a karaoke duet. 
[00:24:30]  She's going down for a time.  Oh, my God.  My friends are gonna be the two.  I want a highway to hell.  She knows how to play, too. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Holy fuck.  You know who the fuck are?  Brian Johnson.  I want a highway to hell.  I want a highway to hell.  She's just very attractive.  She does a bunch of covers on her channel.  Do you have a lot of views?  Huh?  Do you have a lot of views?  Yeah.  4.3 on this one of the wall. 
[00:25:30]  Holy shit.  Her voice isn't bad, right?  No, it's good.  No, she's good, you know.  But it's the whole look.  Yeah.  If that was some fat broad doing this, you'd be like, all right, yeah, she's good.  Click.  You know, I'm literally hypnotized by her eyes.  She could do an 80-minute version of this song.  You could watch it every second of it.  Every second of it.  She's singing it to her room.  She doesn't have any mic on her in front of her.  No. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, she is beautiful.  She knows how to play the one.  It's awesome.  Which is even more sexy.  Absolutely.  The fucking, her tits pressed together.  Well, she's got to push her boobs up against the guitar to play it properly.  Oh, my God.  And they're just like, they're getting that jostling through them from the guitar.  Just enough, you know.  You find your pet back and you know she has no legs.  She's just sitting there on two stumps. 
[00:26:30]  Her fucking mouth is cute.  She's really, her face is beautiful.  That's just ridiculous.  What's her name?  Jess Greenberg.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Is she home for Rosh Hashanah?  What's her YouTube channel?  Jess Greenberg 1.  Why don't we get her on the phone?  Write her an email, man.  Let's get her in person.  Where's she from?  Get her in here.  Well, immediately. 
[00:27:00]  Of course.  Let's get her in here and make love to her.  Can we try to track her down and get her on the phone at least?  Yeah, sure.  And then tell her we want her to come in and do some songs?  Yeah.  Is that what you want?  We'll fly her in.  We got some pocket money laying around this joint, don't we?  She plays her fucking balls off her.  This one only has 2.1 million views because you don't see as much cleavage in this one.  No.  Notice the framing. 
[00:27:30]  Cuts the top of her head off.  Maybe she's bald.  She just got my fucking...  Maybe she got hit by a helicopter.  Oh.  Oh, the fuck is that a horrific story today.  Pretty bad.  I know.  I got my hopes up when I first heard of it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:28:00]  Wow.  She's up all night to the sun.  I'm up all night to get some.  She's up all night for good fun.  I'm up all night to get lucky.  I'm up all night to the sun.  I'm up all night to get some.  I just find myself staring.  I'm terrible.  Her mouth is really beautiful.  She has three...  Beautiful.  A really pretty face.  I don't know why I'm saying nothing, but...  She is that, yeah.  Star quality.  Yeah, that's it.  She's 12. 
[00:28:30]  Cool.  Unbelievable.  Wow.  She's a good singer, too, man.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Can't wait for a Fox cover.  Oh.  Oh, can I hear the first part of that song again?  What did the Fox say?  Yeah, just a little bit.  We don't have to do the whole thing.  I think it goes on a little too long, unfortunately.  I don't know.  How long is the whole thing?  All right.  345.  I'm going to sell it for a song.  Dog goes loose.  Cat goes meow.  Bird goes tweet.  And mouse goes squeak. 
[00:29:00]  Cow goes loose.  Frog goes crow.  And the elephant goes great.  There's a sound.  There's a disco blow.  And the scene goes ow, ow, ow.  But there's no sound that no one knows.  What does the Fox say?  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, me.  It's going to be one of those days.  Nice.  Yeah, Jess Greenberg won on YouTube.  Yeah, yeah.  She's the highway to hell girl.  Hell of a...  I guess, what's that?  Hota?  Hota on...  Oh, Hota, yeah.  She fucked up yesterday.  She was showing off the features of her new phone.  By the way, there are mixed reviews on that damn thing.  The Samsung watch thing you're talking about? 
[00:30:00]  I don't know what it was, but she was showing off features of something,  and her phone number got out over the...  Oh, wow.  ...over TV, and she got, like, a fuckload of text and phone calls,  and I guess you got to change your number after that.  I thought the iWatch thing was a joke, and the fact is it's not.  Like, this Samsung thing, I think it's useless.  Dude, I told you, dude.  Oh, dude, you pick it up, boom, you're in a meeting, call you back.  I call you back, dude.  It just, to me, seems like, because a watch is a weird...  Jonathan, of course, my manager, the gentleman pointed this out. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  That a watch is such a personal thing.  Like, people wear nice watches.  You're not just going to get rid of your nice watch to wear this.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to wear this.  No, but this is...  And it is very personal.  You got to pick one out.  Hold on, man.  No one wears watches anymore.  Yeah.  So they're going to get people to start wearing watches again, is what I'm...  You know, and then if you want to wear a nice watch, yeah, you'll switch it out, I guess.  Give me the watch.  Watch.  But this is...  I think this is going to take off.  They're going to figure this shit out.  I don't know if you can do enough with it.  Like, you can check an email or you can answer your phone. 
[00:31:00]  That's the first version, though.  Yeah.  I mean, there's a big buzz on this thing, although it's a little...  It's getting mixed reviews.  Wait, what are they saying, Ben?  It's a little slow and shit, right?  Wonky still.  Wonky is the term they use.  Wonky.  In the tech world.  Sounds like an English word.  It's a bit wonky.  But they'll work out the bugs.  They think it's going to take off.  Yeah.  I think you're going to see a lot of people wearing these damn things.  Stupid watch.  Yeah.  I'll be damned.  What does the fox say? 
[00:31:30]  Oh, no.  Did you see the gentleman get arrested?  I did not.  I heard about that one.  You want to see it?  Yeah, of course.  It reminded me of when you said it sounds British.  This is an Australian guy.  Uh-huh.  And he's just the most gentlemanly arrest there could ever be.  Oh.  Just the way he talks.  Uh-huh.  You just assured me that I could speak.  I'll sit down inside the car. 
[00:32:00]  We're not assuring anything.  We're under arrest.  Look, I'm under what?  Come on, man.  Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest.  Have a look at the headlock here.  See that chap over there?  Get your hand off my penis!  This is the bloke who got me on the penis before.  Why did you do this to me?  Pop in the car.  For what reason?  What is the charge?  Eating a meal?  A special and tiny meal.  Meal? 
[00:32:30]  Oh, that's a nice headlock, sir.  Oh, yes.  I see that you know your judo well.  And you, sir, are you waiting to receive my limp penis?  Now, get your hands off me.  He's the greatest. 
[00:33:00]  He's getting forced into a police car and, like, his arms and head are getting twisted while he's just saying,  What are you doing for having a dinner?  Get your hands off my penis!  You would think that's from a movie, right?  I know.  That's a real arrest.  Yeah.  Sure it does.  In Australia.  That happened in Australia, huh?  Yeah, I think it was several years ago, but the video's just starting to trickle out now.  It's a different land, boy, I tell you.  You think all the arrests go down like that? 
[00:33:30]  Oh, yes.  Every one of them.  I see you know your judo well.  I see you know your judo.  They just fucking, because here, that guy would have been so fucking tased immediately.  And with no cuff, they didn't even cuff him as they're putting him in the car.  No.  We're putting that up on the Facebook page.  Yep, it's up.  All right, good.  Go to Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  You can see everything we just talked about.  What is the charge, this zap?  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, man, people are saying you got to see that broad sing eulogy. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah?  That broad.  Yeah, check out that broad singing eulogy.  Amazing.  We're talking about the big-breasted one.  The young, big-breasted one.  You got eulogy?  Jess Greenberg.  Oh, she's dynamite.  She is.  You find it?  No?  You, oh, oh.  No?  You don't know how to spell eulogy?  E-U.  E-U.  Yeah, I had it, but it wasn't coming out. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, you didn't?  Oh, fuck.  No?  Is this a dead end?  Another dead end for the listeners.  Stupid.  Is this a dead end?  Listener.  Hold on now.  What did he try to send us to?  He might be right.  Is it a dead end?  Why isn't it on our channel?  God.  It's not there.  It would come up immediately.  You piece of shit.  What a fucking...  What a fucking...  What a fucking...  You're a piece of shit.  Just block him.  What are you doing?  What a fuckface.  You can throw a monkey wrench into the fucking show like that?  What the fuck?  What was he trying to send us to? 
[00:35:00]  Listen to fucking show the song that isn't even on there.  Yeah.  This is Nirvana.  I'll try to save it, but after that, asshole.  Oh, Sam, it's your birthday.  You're working too hard.  Go kill yourself.  This one only has a half million views.  What did she do wrong in this one?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, you got the boobs.  They look nice.  Nice model.  Her head cuts off, though.  You're right.  I'm worried.  Yeah.  There she's got a riffraff hairdo.  Yeah, she has hair like the guy that tortured Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon 1.  Like Chen. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Let's see this.  Man.  Would you kiss her?  Probably would.  She's like an angel.  Yeah, she does.  She does everything like an angel.  She probably takes a dump like an angel.  Oh, yeah.  Smells wonderful.  Imagine her coming out of your bathroom looking for Febreze. 
[00:36:00]  I had to go to her dumping so quickly.  She ruins everything.  Romance is gone already.  It just takes the spark out of Febreze.  She knows how to play with that camera.  She looks right into it.  I would go to whatever shitty coffee shop she was playing at. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Do you know how bad I want to just...  I wish I could interrupt every video.  Like, as she's playing, I just show up in the background behind her and go...  I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot.  I just had a record.  Disappointed people with me.  Oh, it would ruin the moment.  She's pretty when she looks her way through.  She just has a really nice profile.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's pouty. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  She has a pouty look.  Pouty look and smoky eyes.  Is her hair lustrous?  We're all hypnotized.  Oh, my God.  All of her heads are tilted to the side like a dog.  You see how she fucking...  She makes love to the camera. 
[00:37:30]  She looks down at the neck of the guitar when she's doing something and then looks back up  and you're like...  When she looks away at the neck of the guitar, I'm like, but I'm still here.  Look at me.  She's looking right at me.  Oh, she thinks I'm delicious.  She must frame it like that.  Either A, you're right about her head or B, she just likes the eyes being framed that way.  No, it's actually the way people frame things in movies and videos. 
[00:38:00]  You're not supposed to actually get the whole head in there for some fucking reason.  And then, you know, it gets you closer to the eyes and the boobs, too, you know?  Uh-huh.  A little closer.  Very important.  A little head shake there.  She's just fucked up this radio show.  I know.  She's very sexy.  Why?  She's...  I like looking at girls I'm going to wind up dating soon. 
[00:38:30]  Oh.  If that happens, I fuck it.  Are you going to search her out?  She likes me.  Are you going to search her out?  Yeah.  Get her a little tweet?  Go out some coffee.  Wow.  What's her Twitter?  Let's go there right now.  Jess Greenberg Dine.  You already know.  Of course.  I've already retweeted her.  Oh, God.  I wonder where she's from, though.  Might not be from around here.  Yeah.  Why should I be from, like, 50th Street?  She's not from around here. 
[00:39:00]  She only has...  Yeah, she needs more followers than this.  Oh, that'll go up really quick.  She's got a little Jimi Hendrix on the background of her.  She says, my channel is back.  It actually went away.  And then she writes, a massive thank you again to my fans and to my parents for supporting me.  That's a problem.  Oh, you're out, Ant.  That's a problem.  You don't like girls with parents.  Well.  Not ones that they would thank.  No.  Right.  Exactly.  Jesus.  Sorry.  Well, how old is she?  Is she too young?  Oh, what?  What? 
[00:39:30]  We're not the first radio show to pick up on this.  She won a Ryan Seacrest contest.  Oh, yeah?  That fucking guy got booed last night, and I loved it.  Oh, that's why she had two million hits on the Daft Punk song.  Right.  Because she won the Totally Covered Summer contest.  Oh, okay.  Ew.  Good job.  Well, you know, that put her over the top, huh?  Well, she only had 18,000 Twitter followers.  We should help get her some more.  Yeah, man.  And she'll know where all the followers came from today. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, good.  And she'll come on our show.  Listeners are great.  She'll sing a song or two.  Right?  How old is she, though?  She's thanking her parents.  Is she fucking...  She looks more than...  Yeah, she can't be more than 20.  Early 20s.  I don't know.  Tops.  Maybe.  Tops, yeah.  How come she only has...  It's so...  She's got millions of YouTube hits, and she's got 146,000 likes on Facebook.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  What are you talking about?  No, I'm saying that's a lot, but only 18,000 Twitter followers. 
[00:40:30]  Huh?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know why it doesn't translate to Twitter.  Maybe she's a big Facebook broad.  Maybe she just started a Twitter 10 minutes ago.  Yeah.  We want to see what the rest of her body looks like.  Why isn't there a shot of her whole body?  And the top of her head.  Yeah, I'm concerned.  And the top of her head.  There's a problem here.  I think she's got a big fucking tumor.  She's got a conjoined twin on her head.  Is that her?  That's a while ago.  I hope.  Oh, God.  That's about a year ago.  Uh-oh.  She looks about 14 there. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, boy.  She's got a lot of foreheads.  Look at us picking apart a beautiful broad again.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Is that her dad?  Her dad looks younger than us.  Way younger.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Hmm?  Be patient, people.  We're doing some research right here.  I'm going to put her at under 20.  No.  I think I'm going to put her in illegal.  No.  How about that? 
[00:41:30]  Oh, God.  I think she's pushing 20.  I don't know, dude.  Hmm.  Let's find her and look her up.  That's what we're doing.  Is it her?  No, I mean, like, yeah, you're right.  I don't know.  Let's find her and look her up.  Yeah.  We hadn't thought of that.  That's it.  That's the only pictures we get.  There's not a lot of photos, which is weird.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, what's going on with the bottom half?  Is she an iceberg?  Uh-oh.  She could be an iceberg.  Oh.  That would be terrible.  What?  You don't like the head?  I don't know. 
[00:42:00]  I have to see it.  Of course, the iceberg.  Oh, really?  You think she's got sonar-sending glands up there?  All right.  Can we find out how old she is, though?  We can't find out anything.  I don't want to think that she's really the bee's knees and they realize she's 16.  I wouldn't care if she had the fucking head that the guy from the To Serve Man episode of the Twilight Zone had.  Oh, you're getting some intel? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  Can I do this?  Wow.  Sounds like a MIDI.  I can play it over here if you want.  All right.  We'll catch up then, birthday boy.  We'll go to you when you're caught up. 
[00:43:00]  Wow.  Not bad.  Wow.  That looks especially delicious right there.  This is a big high song.  I'm a cowboy.  I wish Tony Romo wasn't. 
[00:43:30]  This girl is going to be so famous by Monday.  Yeah, yeah.  I got some information.  Oh, yes.  Somebody in a production studio who will not be named.  Troy Kwan?  No, no, no, no, no.  If he has info, he should come in here.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Why?  He texted me.  Okay.  And said her SoundCloud says London.  London?  That's going to cost us a lot of money.  She's 18.  She's 18.  18 from London.  18 from London. 
[00:44:00]  She's been playing guitar for eight years.  Wow.  I'm not hearing an English accent.  They do that when they sing.  Amazing.  If she talked and she had that British accent when I'm just turning 18, I would probably  fucking repaint my upper thighs and calves.  I haven't found a single interview with her yet.  She might sound like Adele, though, when Adele's not singing that horrendous English accent  of hers.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:44:30]  I don't care if she sounded like Austin Powers.  I don't care if she sounded like Austin Powers.  What a songbird.  Yes.  Oh, man.  She's destroying the show. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  I can't stop looking now.  It's either going to be her or Chip.  This girl's going to be so fucking famous.  Yeah, but...  She's got the look.  She knows how to look into a camera.  She could always wear a hat, Jimmy.  Rihanna started using bangs.  Right.  She might have to get some bangs going.  No kidding.  You guys like this girl better than those Norwegian guys dressed up as foxes, huh?  No, no, no.  Let's go back to there. 
[00:45:30]  No.  Before we make our official decision.  You're right, Sam.  You're right.  They're Norwegian dudes dressed up as foxes.  Yeah, go back, please.  What are they?  You got to go all the way back to the beginning.  You don't want to hit it right from the hook?  No, you got to go all the way to the beginning.  Because I want to know what the cat says.  Dog goes woo, cat goes meow, bird goes tweet and mouse goes squeak, cow goes loo, frog goes crow, and the elephant goes toot, dog say quack, and fish go blub, and the seal goes ow, ow, ow, ow. 
[00:46:00]  But there's no sound that no one knows.  Everyone.  What does the fox say?  I bet it doesn't make that sound.  What the fox say?  What the fox say? 
[00:46:30]  Hockey, happy, happy, ho.  Hockey, happy, happy, ho.  Hockey, happy, happy, ho.  What the fox say?  Good old man.  What the fox say?  I like how they put the words, too, so you can-  Sing along.  Sing along.  I'm feeling the E-rock parody.  I really am.  Of course you are.  I know there are people out there that just want to get involved with the radio show. 
[00:47:00]  I'm feeling it.  You're feeling it, right, Sam?  Oh, yeah.  Sean F., at this moment, has a lot of competition.  You think he's fucking drooling?  There's going to be a race.  It's going to be a race to get the first one in?  What Iraq says?  What Iraq says?  Are you kidding me?  Do you think there's something to go on there?  We might have a few people.  Iraq's going to have a fun week next week.  You think it'll be done by Monday?  It's got to be.  Really? 
[00:47:30]  It's just topical shit.  It's topical.  We have to attach ourselves to the monstrous phenomenon that the Fox is going to be and already has become.  I agree.  PIX was on it.  Oh, yeah.  Jim, are you tweeting her right now?  No, no, no.  I'm answering a question from somebody.  I have tweeted her briefly.  Roland and I sent her some messages on various social medias.  She's 17.  Here's the link. 
[00:48:00]  Starcentralmagazine.com voting 2012.  12, 11.  She's 13 or 18.  That was last year.  Is there a conversion rate?  Like the pound?  She's actually 32.  Yeah, okay.  Birthday next month.  She's my cousin, this guy says.  Oh, sure.  Oh, cool.  That guy says he's your cousin.  There's no way.  So full of shit.  There's no way.  Some dude from Indiana says...  That's my cousin.  The story checks out.  All right. 
[00:48:30]  Delron42.  Very funny.  What does the Fox say?  Is that her right there on the striped shirt?  Because it's a little more body.  No.  It's not her.  That's not her.  Sure.  It's a younger girl.  Well, I thought maybe it was a younger picture of her.  She wasn't born at 18.  Yeah.  Her body would have changed now.  There's no reason.  She's a professional, man.  They're controlling the images that are going out there.  I'm telling you, this is going to blow up.  Oh.  Her shit's going to blow up in a good way. 
[00:49:00]  There's something, though.  Yeah.  She's got the talent, the look.  Titties.  The titties.  The accent.  Not sure about the ass or the forehead.  You haven't even heard her talking.  I just like playing.  Makes me feel good.  Damping my panties when I sing.  Start playing the guitar.  She might sound like Adele.  No, Adele's got that fat resonance to her voice.  Hello, Jimmy. 
[00:49:30]  But she won that award.  I love the difference between her regular voice and just how she sings.  It's unbelievable.  It's great.  It's great.  You would never think it's the same person.  What do we got there?  Same kind of photos on Tumblr.  It's the same picture of her with the guitar.  They're not fucking doing full body shots yet.  Perfectly lit.  Her makeup's done to a T.  Oh, yeah.  Well, once she gets famous, she won't be able to hide. 
[00:50:00]  No.  She'll be fucking.  Is that threatened?  Pop her out.  Right?  That dick.  You won't be able to hide.  You bitch.  Jesus.  Oh, shit.  Story of the day.  Changing gears.  We have a guy that fucking took off the top of his head with a helicopter here in New York.  Yikes.  I think where you used to live, right, Ed?  Close.  The parks near you in Brooklyn?  Yeah.  I used to fly my helicopter down there.  In that same park? 
[00:50:30]  Probably not the same park.  Mine was about at 74th and Shore Road around there.  Guy really loved his helicopters.  He had a YouTube channel with a lot of his videos of him flying his helicopters.  He was all in.  And yesterday, he was trying some shit.  And they said it took a huge chunk of his head off.  Ow.  And then you read the article further, and it turns out, you know, some eyewitnesses said  that it looked like the whole top of his head was off.  So what was he?  It was crashing, and he was trying to control it? 
[00:51:00]  I don't think he was crashing, Jimmy.  This guy knew what he was doing.  I think he was trying for some crazy-ass tricks, maybe some kind of flyby or something to make  his YouTube videos look a little cooler.  Because they're saying this guy really knew what the fuck he was doing.  He's one of those acrobatic flyers of these model helicopters.  And they're not the quadcopters or the six propeller copters that are all the rage now.  Right.  These are the ones that look like miniature versions of a real helicopter.  One rotor on top, a tail rotor. 
[00:51:30]  And, you know, the rotors span about four feet.  No kidding.  And they spin at about 3,500 RPM.  Wow.  And they have hard carbon fiber blades on them.  So it'll take your fucking top of your head right off.  It's four feet long, the blades?  The blades, yeah.  It's like two two-foot blades, sometimes bigger.  And, yeah.  Jesus.  And he's doing, like, stunts where you fly it upside down, and then it turns, does a loop,  comes around, and it's so fast.  This shit is just fucking happening so fast. 
[00:52:00]  And if you're doing it right in front of you, one wrong move, and that thing comes at you,  bites you.  The owner of the store Brooklyn Hobbies was quoted saying, they crash all day long.  These things crash all day long.  All day long.  Well, because they're trying to do all their tricks.  For the most part, you know, they don't crash and take people's heads off, but they can.  Horrible story.  Very dangerous.  It's on the front page of our papers today. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, I was getting a bunch of, uh, hey, hey, is this you?  No.  I'm not going to take my head off with a fucking little six-inch propeller.  What a stupid question.  Yeah.  Just a kid.  He was only 19, man.  Yeah.  Loved doing this stuff.  Eh, he died doing what he loved.  Screaming.  Yeah, no kidding.  Do you think he screamed or just went down?  No, he was probably done.  Immediately?  Yeah.  You get clocked like that?  Fuck. 
[00:53:00]  Head strike.  Ouch.  What's the attention?  That must be the, uh...  There's an announcement in the hallways.  Everything all right?  Daily.  Goes off every day.  Every fucking day, that shitty thing.  They test the PA system.  Ugh, gosh.  Why is it necessary?  Why?  The morning announcements.  Nothing ever works anyway in a real disaster.  I want an easy job.  What all I have to do is test the PA system every day.  That would get boring if that was your whole job.  It would rule.  Oh, God.  It would rule.  No stress.  All you do.  Right.  Seven o'clock every morning. 
[00:53:30]  Hello, everybody.  Test one, two.  This is a test of the public address system here in the building.  Hope it works.  Thank you.  Because if there's a real emergency, nothing really works ever.  No, you're not going to listen to any of that shit.  You never hear it.  It's panic.  Yeah.  You're going to push the women out of the way and get the fuck out of the building,  right?  Hell yeah.  Exactly.  You can stand to them.  That's right.  Kenny? 
[00:54:00]  You want to hear something funny?  All right.  Jesus.  When we were on vacation that week, there was an actual smoke condition on another floor  and there was a valid fire alarm.  Right.  So the security like had to vacate the building and this floor and like one person was stuck  in one of those little booths like doing their voice tracking stuff.  Yeah.  And it came out like nobody was here. 
[00:54:30]  Like they played a joke on him.  Then the person like had to walk down 36 floors to the lobby.  Why didn't he just stay in the fucking up here?  Why didn't he stay at that point?  I would just stay.  I don't know.  I guess, you know, with the smoke alarm going off.  It never amounts to anything.  They didn't tell him though?  I would take my chances.  I guess they missed that person in that little booth.  I would just take my chances.  He's just walking down 36 flights by himself.  Yeah.  Like a fool. 
[00:55:00]  That's exactly right.  That's a fool.  He's got a story now.  Yeah.  So there I was.  Let me tell you what happened on the 33rd floor.  I made the turn and ended up on the 32nd.  That is a boring ass walk down.  Iraq, it's Pink Floyd Day.  Oh.  All right.  Really?  Why is that?  You don't like Pink Floyd?  No.  You want to play comfortably dumb?  Why don't you like Pink Floyd?  What's wrong with you?  It's overplayed and just horrible. 
[00:55:30]  I disagree with that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's Roger Waters' birthday today.  Tommy.  It's also Sam's birthday.  It's not Rob Zombie Day.  Yeah.  He is so against Pink Floyd.  Why are you so against Pink Floyd?  What did they ever do to you?  He's comparing my birthday to Roger Waters' birthday.  Roger Waters is 70.  And he's got a hell of a career behind him.  Yeah, exactly.  Wait, let's get into this.  Why don't you like Pink Floyd? 
[00:56:00]  I just never did.  Why?  Because growing up, every kid, like, fucking cliche stoner, whatever kid thought Pink Floyd was cool.  And they'd go to the stupid laser light shows out on Long Island.  And you'd see that damn shirt with the prism and the rainbow shooting out everywhere.  Yeah, man.  And it played on every fucking rock station.  And it's like, oh, wow, Pink Floyd.  Let me guess.  Led Zeppelin or The Stones next?  There you go.  Wow. 
[00:56:30]  You rock.  Not a fan.  He's so annoyed, too.  He is really annoyed.  What are your top five Pink Floyd songs to hate?  Since I don't know most of their catalog, all of them.  You don't even know the songs.  Punch up some Pink Floyd songs up there.  What do we got?  You got the Comfortably Numb.  Comfortably Numb is always a fave.  Dumb one with the cash register.  The dumb one with the cash register.  Money.  You rock rules. 
[00:57:00]  What about, you like metal?  Comfortably Numb.  Wish you were here.  Wish you were here.  Time.  Great song.  What are these?  The top Pink Floyd songs of all time?  Ding, ding, ding.  All right.  Top ten Pink Floyd songs of all time.  Go from ten.  Astronomy.  Domine.  I don't know that one.  Have a Cigar.  A little Brain Damage.  Echoes.  Money.  Another Brick.  Part two. 
[00:57:30]  Shining You.  How about Shining You Crazy Diamond?  That's a good one right there.  That's a beautiful song.  I like that one.  Time.  Wish you were here.  What about Wish you were here?  1970 what?  So?  That one's from 75, E-Rock.  It's an older song.  And Comfortably Numb.  Is that what year Wish you were here was?  75?  Wow, I thought that was that old.  No.  What about they're going like, hey, teacher, leave us kids alone. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, the wall.  That movie.  That movie.  That movie.  E-Rock, not a fan.  No.  You wouldn't sit in an arena and watch them build the wall?  No.  And the college kid's singing it up to the Wizard of Oz.  Who the fuck cares?  Well, that was quite impressive.  It really did sync up nice.  You never tried that?  No, because at that point, every kid had it on a videotape.  And you're like, look what I, you didn't come up with it.  It's been around forever.  No one enjoys this shit unless you're totally baked. 
[00:58:30]  Totally baked, huh?  I love the weird stands that E-Rock takes.  Yes.  He never takes a stand on anything.  He's the most wishy-washy dude, except for the weird.  Pink Floyd.  But he's obsessed with hating Pink Floyd.  Why?  Where did this come from?  I don't know.  For nine years, he never said anything about Pink Floyd.  But he knows a lot about it.  He hates them.  He hates them.  I had a roommate in college where if you're coming home, depending on what time of night,  and then you hear, anybody out there? 
[00:59:00]  And then the whole fucking room's foggy.  You're like, I'm just not coming back.  They did have some creepy ass songs, though.  They really did.  But still.  When you heard that coming from your door, you were like, fuck it.  I just knew.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be a fucking stoned fucking...  I'll sleep in the common room.  No.  You wouldn't go sleep in your own bed because you heard the echoes of Pink Floyd coming  from the door.  And then you get just like four idiots staring at a lava lamp and a PlayStation sign hanging 
[00:59:30]  up on the wall.  They're digging it.  They're digging their buzz.  Yeah, man.  You're a buzz kill for them, I bet.  This means something.  I guess you didn't like blacklight posters, either.  They're pretty cool.  They glow.  Dude, they were comfortably numb.  They were rocking, man.  You get it?  Hello.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  He rocks like goodbye.  Is there anybody out there?  It's E-Rogg. 
[01:00:00]  Not anymore.  Yeah.  Not again, huh?  That was their go-to stoner music?  I guess they had a...  What the late 90s equivalent of a mixtape would be.  I guess a CD that would just play certain songs on loop over and over.  And that was one of them.  And the cash register song.  It's called Money.  I love that.  It's the cash register song.  Sounds like something from a kid's show.  Oh, the cash register.  Can you play the cash register song? 
[01:00:30]  I want to see where you hate it.  There was something about a gig in the sky.  Yeah, great gig in the skies.  Okay, Yoko, who enjoys that?  She's moaning along to the song.  Yeah, that is...  Wow, that is annoying, that one.  Oh.  Yeah, wow.  You got it?  Yeah, I got it.  The cash register song.  Here's the cash register song.  What's the problem with this?  It goes from ear to ear.  Kind of nice.  Dark Side of the Moon didn't do very well. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, it did.  It wasn't on the charts very long.  It was.  What do you think of the sound effects, E-Rock?  Okay.  I get it?  It's my fan.  Sounds like my princess.  I'm sorry.  I would hate for someone to come up with a Pink Floyd slash E-Rock parody song.  Oh, no.  That would really drive him nuts.  Honey? 
[01:01:30]  Honey!  It's delicious.  And you're okay.  All right.  But this is a whole new thing.  Sean F. is now going to have lyrics in his parody songs that are just about hating Pink Floyd.  Hating Pink Floyd.  And I hate Pink Floyd.  Just learn a little more about E-Rock.  Good fodder.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe in the What E-Rock Says song, you can mention that he doesn't say anything good about Pink Floyd. 
[01:02:00]  No.  I love the visual of E-Rock trying to get back to his dorm room and he hears, is there anybody?  You have to just stop if you could hear me.  Throws his book bag out on him.  Shit.  God damn it.  Not again.  Stoners.  Pink Floyd shit.  Bunch of fucking ho-hos in his book bag and two books.  You didn't smoke the weed in college, E-Rock?  No.  God, everyone did.  He's just carrying his used condoms around in a book bag.  Right.  Just trying to get his precious niggle seed back into his dorm room. 
[01:02:30]  He's going to freeze it and sell it for millions.  Right.  He's just hooking up with chicks and then putting the used condoms in his book bag.  Exactly.  And then smelling their cunts on the outside of it.  And then has to come back to his roommates playing Pink Floyd.  Oh, how annoying.  You had a horrible college career.  Oh, it's that goddamn cash register song again.  They're all having fun banging chicks.  He's just alone, cranky.  Sleeping in the common room, yeah.  Yeah.  What was your band of choice as they were, you know, into Pink Floyd? 
[01:03:00]  Should have been Lap.  Oh, God.  And on that note.  You're listening.  Sirius XM.  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got some champions for you to meet right now.  Happy 18th birthday to young Sammy Roberts.  This is going out from Greg, Anthony, Bobo, David, and Tippi. 
[01:03:30]  It's Pink Floyd Day.  What happened?  Iraq's being defiant.  It is Pink Floyd Day in honor of Roger Waters turning 70. 
[01:04:00]  Ah, it's some Pink Floyd for you.  It doesn't sound like it.  Wow.  Because E-Rock said that it's like playing Rob Zombie for Sam's birthday or something.  He just hates Pink Floyd.  He's looking for excuses to not play Pink Floyd.  How old is young Sam Roberts today?  He says 30, but come on.  I'm 30 years old today.  Is it?  That big one there?  30?  Yeah.  What are you feeling, dude?  How are you doing?  I'm okay.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm good with it.  You all right? 
[01:04:30]  30's a big one.  Yeah.  I'm good with it.  I'm happy about it.  Yeah.  I'm right.  20s are finished.  Yeah.  I'm aware.  Your youth is gone.  And by the way, it exponentially goes faster every decade.  Oh, God, yeah.  So your 20s from 20 to 30 took, you know, whatever.  You know how long that took.  About 10 years.  Yeah, about 10 years.  But 30 to 40 takes five years.  And it felt like 10 years.  But 30 to 40.  Five years.  Will feel like half of that 20 to 30.  And then it just keeps going.  I'm going to make every day count then. 
[01:05:00]  You should, Sam Roberts.  Thank you.  You should.  Yeah.  I'm going to make every day just grab onto it.  Yeah.  Get out of bed in the morning with zest, vim, and vigor.  I'm going to make 30 count.  Yes.  Football season started last night.  And I know that because Roland is walking around in brand new attire.  Roland loves jumping on bandwagons.  Yeah.  What are some of the other shirts he had over the years? 
[01:05:30]  I can't remember anymore.  He walked in here last year.  Huh?  He had Lynn Sanity.  Oh, he had a Lynn Sanity shirt, even though he doesn't watch basketball.  Last year, he had a Tebow Jets shirt the minute Tebow was on.  Before Tebow was playing a game.  Right, right.  Okay.  Collected his item.  And he says that he wears these shirts because he likes to get high fives in the subway.  Yeah.  I think he had a Roland is too high t-shirt or something.  Of course he did.  He just loves jumping on the bandwagon.  But he texted me last night and he goes, oh, football season's starting. 
[01:06:00]  You get to see who my new team is tomorrow.  Yeah, that's why I'm bringing this up.  He's a huge Jets fan.  It's one of the only things I know about him.  He was.  Yeah, I know because he's walking around in brand new Giants.  You know what?  What's wrong with him?  It used to be Brooklyn Nets.  But what's wrong with that?  Oh, yeah.  When it was announced that the whole Brooklyn thing.  Everything was black and white.  He came right in here with Brooklyn Nets stuff.  I forgot about that.  What's wrong with just changing teams?  Like this year?  No, I'm going for the Giants.  He works right, though.  He'll do it mid-season.  So he was Brooklyn Nets all the way and then got Linsanity and was just wearing blue and 
[01:06:30]  orange all the time.  I think it's whatever shows up on the front page of Modell's website.  Oh, is that what he got?  Yeah.  There he is.  Roland, you're a Jets fan.  What are you doing?  I was a Giants fan way before until you guys ruined it.  Oh, how did we ruin it?  How did we ruin it?  Remember when we enfranchised Eric and Sam for David Tyree, the guy who caught the football?  Oh, we did do a franchise show.  It was more than just a catch, Roland.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  It was a Super Bowl.  You know what?  Fast forward a few years.  It was just a catch.  That's all it lacks.  You know, looking back.  Yeah.  It was easy for him to say, you know, it was more than just a catch and he got a book out  of it.  But then a few more years go by.  Nah, it was just a catch.  It was pretty much just a catch.  That was it.  But he was my free tickets into the Giants.  Well, we blew that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Did he find out he was not talking to Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, I think like four days later.  We had places to be. 
[01:07:30]  We were busy.  I'll always remember.  Man, there are times we just don't give a shit.  It's like a guy that had that amazing catch we couldn't stick around to talk to.  He looked at me and E-Rock and he goes, man, you guys are legends.  You guys look young.  Oh, wow.  It's like, oh, yeah.  And Eric goes, so what's this Jesus stuff in this book?  I'm like, oh.  So that's when you had a bell on the Giants for a while?  Yeah.  That's about five, six years ago now, right?  Yeah.  But I'm back now. 
[01:08:00]  You're back with the Giants.  Until he kicked them off the team and everything.  Yeah.  He wasn't even on the team the next year or something, right?  Yeah, I think he was just like a bench and then they finally kicked him off.  Yeah.  So it just really was a catch.  It was just a catch indeed.  A pretty amazing catch at that.  Yeah, but you know.  So the Giants are your team, huh?  Yeah, go Giants.  Did you watch the game last night?  I did.  It wasn't the Giants, I know.  Peyton Manning, what, threw for seven touchdowns last night?  And Ryan Seacrest got booed.  Huh?  Ryan Seacrest got booed. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, that's where this is heading.  I watched a little bit of it.  Did you watch?  Yeah, just, you know, so I could watch a little bit of it.  There was a late for almost an hour, though.  I was like, all right, I'll watch, see what the hell the hubbub's about.  I saw a pretty funny fumble, little interceptions, things like that.  Kind of cute, kind of fun.  I saw a cheerleader's fucking pussy.  Oh, where?  Right there.  Where?  Some cheerleader, they were going to break, I guess, and they were showing the cheerleaders. 
[01:09:00]  She bent over, and you literally could see the brown that was around her asshole.  Yes.  Yeah.  She had no panties?  No, she had no panties, but she was bent over so much.  Right.  It spread out enough where you got to see some of the dirt.  Is this the NFL?  Some of that filth, yeah.  Some of the dirt.  They showed her butt?  It's everywhere, because people freeze-frame that one fucking part of her cheer.  Is she sure?  I don't know.  NFL cheerleader ass.  You're going to get a lot, I think, if you go to- 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, how about Broncos game?  Like, Broncos.  The guys were tweeting us all night about it.  I know.  I got it somewhere.  I got quite a few tweets about it.  Oh, fuck.  How are you up and find it?  What does the wolf say?  Oh, there it is.  Oh, my God.  They have those big, unsexy panties on.  They really do, yeah, yeah.  They really do, yeah, yeah.  You can't show their-  Why not? 
[01:10:00]  Show your twat or put down the pom-poms.  Fucking worthless cheerleaders are.  Yeah, I'm team!  Shut up.  It's football and NBC.  They got to wear bigger panties.  Big, dumb underwear.  Fuck cheerleaders.  They annoy me.  Yeah.  You don't need them.  You don't need that to make guys root for fucking football.  It is kind of an archaic thing.  It sounds stupid.  Ooh, titillating.  Ooh!  Look at the gals.  Ooh! 
[01:10:30]  Don't like them, huh?  No.  No?  I don't.  That's too bad.  Remember the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader movie?  Yeah, with Bucky Dent was in that.  Was Bucky Dent in that?  Yes, he was.  Who else was that?  Could you find the trailer for that?  Maybe there's a trailer for it.  Was it a TV movie or was it a theatrical release?  The Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders were...  Yeah, Bucky Dent played the boyfriend of a girl going out for the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders,  I believe.  Was Burt Convy in that?  I don't remember.  I would hope so.  It was, yes.  What good film didn't have Burt Convy?  Didn't have Burt Convy.  His scenes from Apocalypse Now never should have been cut out. 
[01:11:00]  Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader movie.  I think it was a TV movie, but we could watch the opening credits.  Yeah, right?  Oh, sure.  Let's see who's in it.  Oh, boy.  Now they just showed them dancing and...  Yeah, that's them.  They were the...  Good music.  It's just the cheerleaders.  Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.  People watched this.  Oh, God.  I remember watching it.  Oh.  I just wanted to see the Cowboys in it.  Did you?  I didn't care about the girls. 
[01:11:30]  Starring Jane Seymour.  Jane Seymour.  Oh, he can't stand.  Fuck Jane Seymour.  Elevator cunt.  Thank you for remembering.  Lorraine Stevens.  And Burt Convy.  And Burt Convy.  And Burt Convy.  Good call.  That's right.  Holy shit.  Bucky Dent.  Bucky Dent.  Why was Bucky Dent in this?  He was acting.  Also starring the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.  I just love the words Dallas Cowboys.  Who else is in this?  Jennifer Shaw.  Nobody.  No big stars.  No one there. 
[01:12:00]  What the fuck?  Tony Dorsett, of course.  And, oh, Lauren Tews.  She was the co-cab from the Lumpo.  No.  Yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  I want to see some of the acting.  This looks so bad.  You think so?  The music's good.  Yes.  They're just showing slow motion cowboy footage.  Yeah.  And cheerleaders as the credits roll.  Back in the day.  Little Roger Staubach.  That's Staubach, huh?  Of course it is.  Number 12.  And it looks like, is that Drew Pearson?  Has to be, right?  Wow. 
[01:12:30]  Damn.  That's more than a catch.  That's right there.  Oh, wow.  And Tony Hill.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Burt Convy.  They're watching this game on TV.  What a smile at.  He's jerking off with his buddy in the office watching the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.  Cheerleaders.  All right.  He's got some.  I've been watching that cassette of the Super Bowl for a week.  Cassette.  You know where the TV cameras spend most of their time?  On those girls.  No, they don't.  The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. 
[01:13:00]  Incredible.  Two best teams in the country going head-to-head on the field.  The TV cameras are panning the sidelines.  Huh.  Those girls are the hottest thing around.  Those girls are the hottest things around, Beavis.  But we always need three months.  You've got two.  I want them for the September cover story.  Since when are we putting out a cheap cheesecake magazine?  We're not.  But even a good, serious magazine has to pay the bills.  Wow.  Now you're caving into those clowns in the front office.  This is poor acting.  Yes.  Those clowns in the front office sign your paycheck and mine. 
[01:13:30]  They want more circulation, and I'm going to give it to them.  Oh.  Signs.  It's not just sex.  Oh.  What is it?  There's a story there, and I can smell it.  Oh.  Do you have an angle?  I've been thinking about it.  Yes.  Behind the scenes with the most gorgeous girls in America.  Wow.  Now we have part two.  Oh, my God.  No, we can't do this today.  Dude, that's so good.  We can't do this today.  That's our goal is to, at some point, watch an entire movie on the air. 
[01:14:00]  Especially a good one like this.  What happens?  He smells a good story.  Yeah.  We can't.  We just can't.  That was porn acting.  You're right.  It was terrible.  So bad.  You have a story, do you?  The production values back then, like, you realize how far entertainment has come.  I mean, you know.  A lot slicker now, right?  You do.  I mean, we are stuck with fucking lousy reality shows and just fucking mindless drivel.  But, I mean, look at that.  That was terrible. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  You need some better dialogue.  Oof.  We're not putting these filthy cunt bags on our magazine.  Hey, fucko.  No one's buying our magazine.  So it's either these filthy cunt bags or you're looking for a job.  Good point.  I wanted to see Bucky Dent's acting.  Can't we see Bucky Dent?  Can't you Google fucking Bucky Dent and the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders?  Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders movie, Bucky Dent.  I had a Yankee and the Cowboys in it. 
[01:15:00]  That is.  There's nothing that made me happier as a boy.  Why would they have that?  I don't know.  Why was Bucky Dent in there?  There's no clips.  Because he was a big star back then.  Yeah, he was.  His girls loved him.  240-something batting average.  But the chicks loved him.  He was a cute guy, I guess.  Yeah.  Average shortstop.  It's too bad.  There's no clips.  It's really too bad.  None?  Bummed out?  Yeah, I'm kind of bummed.  Are they none?  Not one.  What's the Bucky Dent show?  I don't know.  No, no, no.  Who doesn't love Bucky Dent?  That's a shame.  Lots of people.  Roland, Ryan Seacrest got booed last night. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  And you loved it?  I loved it.  Why did you love it?  I'm a big fan of his.  Because he's got Carson Daly's back is why he loved it.  That's right.  Loyalty.  But it seemed like they lowered it down the booze though.  You hear like a loud booze and it started lowering.  Oh, they turned it down.  Yeah.  Please welcome Ryan Seacrest.  I only know of one other countdown that might be as big as this one.  America is ready for 17 weeks of excitement followed by the drama of the playoffs all culminating in New York at the Super Bowl. 
[01:16:00]  Nobody likes this guy.  No.  No.  The industry likes him so he's just in places that we're going to be anyway.  It's not like people go to watch Ryan Seacrest.  He plays music people like so they listen.  He's at the fucking Times Square so people watch.  But the business likes him.  He's safe.  He's a handsome guy.  He's very safe.  Yes.  He's exactly what the business likes.  He's not offensive.  But why does everyone hate him?  Like he just.  Because he's a bore in the end.  He stinks. 
[01:16:30]  He's worth millions but he stinks.  And I mean he's everything football isn't.  Like I don't know why they would have.  Other than the NBC tie in to promote his stupid game show that's coming out.  Like why.  Oh that's why.  Yeah of course.  But why would they think.  Like cross promotion shit.  Football fans wouldn't boo Ryan Seacrest.  Right.  He's just.  He says nothing interesting.  Hey yeah.  He's an announcer voice.  Yeah.  It's just none of it's interesting.  It's nonsense.  It is nonsense.  That music starts up like it's a big fucking event. 
[01:17:00]  And then they play.  And Ryan Seacrest comes out.  Then they play Final Countdown right after him.  Yes.  That's a great song.  It's the final countdown.  No electric.  She's touching my penis.  Penis.  That's how I used to sing.  Really?  Oh yeah.  It's fun.  Jesus.  I got to say.  I was watching a fucking ad for this new I guess to Honda.  Honda fucking little minivan fucking kid carrier thing. 
[01:17:30]  Sure.  Brilliant.  They fucking put a goddamn vacuum in the car.  Like a little hatch in the back.  Like over the wheel well.  You put it down and pull a fucking vacuum out.  And they like vacuum up like Cheerios and shit.  I was like why did it take so long to think to put a vacuum as part of the fucking car?  That's beautiful.  I was stunned.  Amazed.  Kudos Honda.  Do you want to buy one for Beavis?  No Beavis doesn't need.  Boy am I just teaching that cat just the worst fucking habits. 
[01:18:00]  Why?  What happened?  I don't know.  You teach him how to surf certain websites?  Because it's cute first of all.  And like I don't like you know don't like yeah don't do that.  So the other day was was climbing up the sliding screen door to my back which you know  you're supposed to not let him do that I guess.  No.  Kind of bad but yeah.  And as far as playing and and have him bite my hand and attack me and stuff like that 
[01:18:30]  I just let him do that.  It's going to backfire.  It's going to backfire so bad.  Sam has an old fucking grumpy cat now.  But it's adorable.  It's adorable now.  My cat.  Look at that.  He goes yeah it is.  He's like 20 pound monster and he just sits there looking cute and he comes up to you  and he's like oh I'm just going to cut you.  I'm just going to cut.  Whap!  Then just whaps you.  Yeah.  He'll grab you with his nails.  He'll try to bite a chunk out of your leg, out of your arm, whatever's near. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah like I'm walking to the refrigerator or something.  I stop to open the fridge and he just grabs on and crawls up my leg.  You know how they do that climb up and I'm like oh look at him.  You know what happened?  I had my cat up on my shoulder and now it takes my entire body because he's a huge monster  of a cat and he thought it'd be funny oh like I was a kid and I'll crawl down his back.  The entire back of my shirt ripped.  I can't wear the shirt anymore. 
[01:19:30]  Just bad habit.  Is that what you did?  You taught him bad habits?  Of course because it's adorable.  He was like the size of a water jug.  And it's like look at this little guy.  He's biting my feet.  Go ahead and bite it you little tyke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now you got a monster in your house.  Yeah and now his big boy teeth came in and he started eating a monster.  You're raising a monster.  I can't help it.  It's just you know I don't want to yell at the little thing.  Oh that's funny.  We have to put a giant piece.  He can't be in the bedroom anymore when we sleep.  No? 
[01:20:00]  Because he attacks Jess at 6 o'clock in the morning to wake her up.  Like he just starts you know trying to pull her hair out of her scalp.  That sounds.  Oh well.  Yeah but he's 20 pounds now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And batting her across the face.  So we have to kick him out at night.  And now we have to put a giant piece of cardboard up in front of the bedroom door.  Like a couple of hobos.  Why?  Because at 5 o'clock in the morning he thinks now it's time to scratch at the door without stopping until somebody wakes up. 
[01:20:30]  There you go it.  And then if you let him in you're just like okay you can come in and get on the bed and we're going to go back to sleep.  He's like no you're not going back to sleep.  Oh man.  Unless you want claws digged into your face.  He scratches your face.  Here's how you train.  The first time that happens you pick him up by the stomach and you throw him across the room.  Oh no.  And he would never do that again.  You can't do that.  Can't daddy says not to do that.  Jimmy better not ever have to kill him now.  I've had cats but cats are different.  You fucking got to scream at them. 
[01:21:00]  You can't scold them.  It makes them very aggressive when you do that.  But they know not to scratch your face.  You know what happens when I've told him no?  I go no and I wave my finger at him and he'll take his little hands and swat at my finger and I just go aww.  Wait till the first day you come in with a giant gash across your finger.  That fucking gash that has like a quarter inch of pink around it.  Yes.  Because it's fucking infected in a second.  I can't wait for this kitten to grow up.  That backwards training is so...  Training them after they're a cute kitten is so difficult. 
[01:21:30]  You know what he does when I yell at him?  He turns sideways to me, hunches his back, puts his tail up and all puffy, and turns his head and then bounces sideways.  And I go aww.  Exit stage left.  Oh, look at him.  He's bouncing.  It's hilarious.  How are we doing with the viral videos?  I don't know.  I just fucking put up that one video.  I don't really pay attention.  You should.  I guess I should.  You've got a cute little fucking kitten that was made for the internet. 
[01:22:00]  Your kitten was made for the internet.  Let's get this done.  I didn't video.  He was trying to steal my beer last night.  He likes stealing things.  So I have the beer in my hand and he comes up and grabs the pull tab with his teeth and fucking walks away with it.  How much of an intervention do you need?  Even he sees it.  He's been there four days and he's like, oh, there's a problem here.  I'm not getting fed. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, shit.  Until he wakes up.  Oh, God.  Yeah, well, you know.  Bad habits, though.  You can't teach him later?  No.  Gotta start now.  It's so much fun when they're a kitten to have them do bad things.  It's like we used to, oh, if we move our feet around in the bed, he'll attack our feet.  That's what he does.  Right.  But now he still does it.  He's five and 20 pounds of monstrous cat meat.  Oh, no. 
[01:23:00]  So he doesn't just realize, oh, I'm bigger now.  I shouldn't do this.  I meant to send this to you and I never did.  Oh, my God.  Because I saw the photos of you with the little cat lying on you.  Yes, the little kitten on my shoulder.  Oh, my God.  It looks like.  That's retarded.  Yeah.  Yeah, so is the cat.  That cat is as wide as your torso.  Yeah.  No.  Now, that's a giant cat right there.  Fat fuck.  How many pounds is that?  He's 17 pounds.  What did you do?  You fed the cat too much.  No, he's just a big, feral cat. 
[01:23:30]  Holy shit.  You have a spade or neutered?  Yeah.  Didn't you get him wild or something?  Yeah, he's feral from the pound.  Oh, see, why'd you do that?  It's crazy.  Well, because it's like you get free kittens from the pound and you can save them from being killed.  Fuck that.  If they were there, there's probably a reason they were in prison.  It's a little baby cat.  Yeah.  So, is he nice to you?  Yeah, he is.  He's nice to me.  Why don't you go adopt a convict?  Yeah, go ahead.  Because that's pretty much what you just did.  Go to fucking Rwanda and help a fucking child. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  Adopted the child of a convict, not a convict.  I don't know.  That's right.  If they're in that predicament, they did something wrong.  If they're in the pound, they did something.  They did something wrong.  That's what I tell you.  He was born.  They're guilty of something.  That's right.  Could just be a burden on everyone anyway.  Might as well fucking kill them.  He's a victim of his environment.  No, I don't think so.  I think it's in their fucking DNA.  Cats, right?  Yeah, the cats.  Yeah, no, he was born into where he was.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I like a more refined cat that was brought up and, you know, had the parents right there. 
[01:24:30]  That's what I saw.  I see no parentless fucking cat at a cat prison.  No, we just got this dark little kitty.  Oh, God.  No parents.  Cat says what?  Cat says...  The cat, I believe.  What does the cat say again?  It was...  Oh, no.  The elephant goes cute.  Doxy quark and fish go blow. 
[01:25:00]  And the seal goes ow, ow, ow.  But there's one sound that no one knows.  What's that?  What does the fox say?  What the fox say?  What is that from?  What is that from?  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  What the fox say?  Hockey, hockey.  That's from something, though.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. 
[01:25:30]  That whole thing is somewhere.  Yeah, wait.  Oh, oh, it's that.  The rock song?  No, no.  It's like a dance song from the 80s.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Everybody dance now.  Everybody dance now.  90s.  Yeah, yeah.  90s.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah?  That's it.  Let's say hi to Matt in West Virginia.  Matt.  Talking cats, sir.  Oh.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Matt.  The best way I've found to train a cat is you take it and you're running underwater in 
[01:26:00]  the sink, and then you put it in a Tupperware container, and you put it in the freezer for  about an hour.  Jesus.  That isn't even funny.  No.  That would probably kill it, dude.  Oh, really?  There's always one in the town we lived in.  There was always a story.  You're the story.  It was a mill pond for us.  It was like a potato sack filled with kittens that they found.  This guy used to take kittens and bury them up to the neck and run them over with a lawnmower. 
[01:26:30]  There was one in every town that did some shit with cats.  I forget what story I heard.  It was a girl I knew whose father, when the kittens were born, drowned each one where he  stepped on all of them.  He stepped.  He killed them all by stepping on them.  Oh, is that terrible?  Horrible.  Jeez.  I guess Patton Oswalt's here.  Already?  All right.  Why don't we take a break, then?  We could do that.  We'll break, and we'll get Patton Oswalt on next.  Stay there.  The Opinion Anthony Show on Sirius X. 
[01:27:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the Opinion Anthony Show.  Yeah.  That's a...  It's Pink Floyd Day, Anthony.  Is it?  Yes.  Iraq's being defiant.  He refuses to play the Floyd.  He is.  Pleatant insubordination.  We learned earlier that he hates Pink Floyd. 
[01:27:30]  Why are we playing this?  Because it sounds like the Fox song we're playing off and on today.  It does.  That would be it.  That would be it.  He goes, everybody.  Yeah.  We're hoping no one does the Iraq parody of the Fox song.  Yes, because repeating it over and over is not going to make it happen.  Oh, he's on to us.  Fuck.  He's a fourth wall.  Took nine years, but I think he's finally on to us.  What does the Iraq say? 
[01:28:00]  What does Iraq say?  Yeah, you got to get rid of the...  Patton Oswalt outside the studio.  What's he up to?  Well, we're going to find out what Patton Oswalt is all about.  We were having a nice conversation.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he was talking about an old clip from our show that I think his brother gave him,  and he loved it.  Patton, how you doing, man?  Hello, man.  What's slapping in?  You want to tell what we were talking about?  Because it's definitely worth mentioning on the air.  It's the clip of you... 
[01:28:30]  Someone combined it on YouTube.  It's the clip of you guys dissecting Barry Williams' Branson show,  and then goes right into Yakov's Dinner Adventure.  Dinner Adventure.  I think I've watched that.  I'm not exactly...  Probably like 10 times at this point.  Oh, God.  Especially because that's my nightmare for where my career would end up.  Of like, okay, you got to think about this crowd and what they...  Because what really is scary about that clip is what they're selling is for one night, 
[01:29:00]  you get to have the world the way you want it, which is nice.  Yes.  And quiet and slow.  Yes.  And it's nice.  Remember when the woman was like, you kept the food hot.  And she goes, I don't know how you did it.  And you realize these probably...  What these people can afford is a lot of places where the food probably isn't hot.  Oh, it's cold.  They cook it really well.  And there's nothing they can say about it.  No.  They have no power anymore.  Powerless.  So it's like for one night, it's a world where the food is hot. 
[01:29:30]  There's no blacks.  All this night, you get to have the world like it was in 1941 when you were still healthy.  Right.  And you weren't looking at death.  Oh, my God.  We might have to podcast that, Sam.  That is...  Write it down.  Great assessment of that.  And then the magnetic trays we were talking about.  And there was a reason for the magnetic trays.  Here's the reason for the magnetic trays.  They found...  They realized if we get rid of the tables, we can pack 200 more people into this room 
[01:30:00]  and seat them and feed them like pigs.  Like literally.  And I think one of you guys were saying, yeah, and when the show's over, you know,  they just take a fire hose to the floor and tables and just wash it into a sluice gate,  probably at the bottom of the auditorium, and then just get the next round of pigs in.  Right.  The next batch.  Because they do like five shows a day.  Like, get them in.  Yes.  Move.  Move.  Move through.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  And then also the care that my personal chef takes.  And as he's saying it, there's footage of just mass trays coming out with plastic covers 
[01:30:30]  to keep it hot.  Like, the visual totally negates everything that he's bragging about.  And then he's saying, yes.  My personal chef.  He totally slaves over this.  He's slaving over the frozen chicken cordon bleu that he gets by the fucking, like, the  shipping containers are out back full of chicken cordon bleu.  The chef was making it all fresh.  I don't think so.  It's weird.  Yeah.  And, well, it's weird that he says that it's making it fresh, and yet they show a platoon 
[01:31:00]  of frightened Venezuelans who are working in his kitchen that are terrified of being hit.  Like, it is the most horrifying.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's so many.  It's fascinating.  It's one of our greatest discoveries ever.  I'm fascinated.  When we learned about this.  Yeah.  With Branson, that whole thing.  Yeah.  Like, we were watching that guy.  What's his name?  Kirby the Magician.  Oh, yeah.  And it was like this horrible trying to look like Vegas thing, but the tricks just weren't 
[01:31:30]  good.  And it wasn't the glitz.  It was Branson.  A little off.  You watch it and realize, oh, wait, this is 9.30 in the morning.  This isn't Rat Pack stuff.  This is.  Right, right.  And then we're going to have my nap afterward, and then 3 o'clock dinner, and then we'll go  to sleep.  And that's waiting for so many of us.  I told Pat, if you enjoy that, he has to do the Joe Piscopo one we did, where you came  in that day and said, you got to see this Showtime Joe Piscopo special. 
[01:32:00]  Woke up in the middle of the night, opened my eye, and Joe Piscopo was on.  It was a new special that he had.  And it was Club Piscopo, it was called.  And it's like him going, doodly-o-doo-a, just doing like Frank Sinatra stuff, telling stories  in between the songs.  This was recent.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  The most recent Showtime special.  Yes.  Maybe a year ago.  At this point.  Oh, this is just.  I was stupefied.  Yeah.  I was, when I was in Staten Island, I was telling Opie that he has a, like a, he had it when 
[01:32:30]  I was there, he had like a residency at some hotel that he was doing, like out on Staten  Island, which I thought, that's kind of cool.  Like he's out, like while you're in Manhattan doing stuff, out on Staten Island, Joe Piscopo  is going up right now and doing a show, but a whole show, is that like on, can I, I just  got XM Radio Satellite 103.  I got that station with, which has you guys on it. 
[01:33:00]  Uh-huh.  And I just, oh, nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Riding around LA, it justifies all my anger.  E-Rock's actually going to burn a CD of the Joe Piscopo thing for you.  I would, oh man.  It is.  I think you would enjoy that if you like the, you know, the Yakov slash Barry Williams stuff.  Well, the Yakov thing is great because they match the visuals to everything you guys are  talking about.  Yes, I love that they're doing that.  Which really adds to the horror of what you're seeing.  Like, as bad as your descriptions are, all the visuals back up every single thing you're  saying.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no denying it.  I'm hoping someone does that with the Happy Days thing we did yesterday. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because that'll do really well.  And discovered a Happy Days episode where they handle the-  The racial issue.  The racial issue.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was-  Tom Bosley has a black friend.  It was one of the original ones.  It was terrific.  Not in front of the live studio audience.  It was done on film.  It was one of the original ones.  And yeah, he was going to be the best man at a black guy's wedding.  And they had the black guy at his house and they had the stereotypical neighbor come  over and go, oh, she's all like scared because he's a black guy.  We watched the whole episode yesterday.  Oh, wow. 
[01:34:00]  On this show.  Well, there's also that clip where you guys-  I can't believe I'm-  I'm like-  It's like I'm a nerd that won-  Win a morning with opiate energy.  And then-  Remember that one episode that you did when you-  But there's this episode where you guys dissected-  And this is also on YouTube, the Dudley episode of different-  Oh, God, yeah.  In which you-  The line, you uttered the line, Dudley's a goer.  I was like, oh.  But then somebody-  There was a website. 
[01:34:30]  I think it's College Humor.  Oh, man.  Or it might have been on the website.  But they pointed out all those very special episodes where a kid is molested or someone  is raped or someone has cancer.  Or overdoses.  Yeah, or overdoses.  Those were live tapings for an audience, most of which had traveled from the Midwest,  like we're going to go to LA, we're going to go see a show, and they've bought a ticket  and they've sat there for four hours to watch a kid get raped.  Like, their big Hollywood trip ends with watching a show about a kid being molested. 
[01:35:00]  They just wanted to laugh.  Yeah, exactly.  I thought you were saying they were the lucky audience.  And it was the best birthday I ever had.  Yeah, they just wanted to escape from LA.  One of those shows, like, oh, I'm going to see the show.  It's a comedy.  We all laugh.  We watch it every week.  Yeah, we watch it.  And they've got to sit there for the audience that goes, oh.  That low, like, oh.  Yeah, the one time they hear Arnold say, what you talking about?  It's to a man about to rape his friend in a fucking empty tub. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  What you talking about?  It's not the same fun tone.  The catchphrase isn't as fun.  Right, right.  Yeah, it's actually, it's really, what, what you talking about?  Yeah, what?  About.  Yeah, yeah.  This is our anniversary!  We do, like, picking things apart on the show.  That's fun.  The Happy Days one is the latest one.  That was great.  That was yesterday?  Yeah, it was fun, man.  Fun to watch them juggle the racial issue.  Oh, and it was fun.  It was so ham-handed.  Gary Marshall style.  Yes, it was done so ham-handedly. 
[01:36:00]  You got a clip there, Sam?  Just awful.  Or no?  I have, I'm just looking up to see what's out.  There's a four and a half hour YouTube video, which is the, uh, all parts, the saga of you  guys and Joe Piscopo.  Wow.  Uh, so if you have four and a half hours.  What, are there visuals and stuff?  Because I think there are some throughout.  Oh, God, okay.  The next day, we had him on the show.  Yeah, it was a trilogy.  You were saying it.  Oh, man.  It was a trilogy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's five parts, Iraq is saying, and then, you know, then he started coming in, and he's 
[01:36:30]  getting girls pregnant all over the place, and we're like, will you stop?  He's an animal, Piscopo.  He's an animal.  We love him.  Yeah.  In the end, we love the guy.  He loves throwing that seed around, that Piscopo seed.  Yeah.  Man, he just knocks these young girls up.  He's got to fertilize the earth.  Yes.  When the earth loses its Piscopo, the dead will walk the earth.  That's why Piscopo's here.  We could get him on the phone right now if you want to say hi, Pat.  Jesus.  I wouldn't know what to say.  Want a quick phone call with Joe?  We put the whole thing on a podcast, too, so it's out there. 
[01:37:00]  Okay, good.  The whole thing.  I'm telling you, the Joe Piscopo stuff is terrific.  I love he just refuses to pull out.  Like, I really respect him.  Oh, yeah.  He's had nothing but bad luck, and he just won't stop fucking aiming for the womb.  He is a fertile guy.  Holy shit.  This guy's back in fucking 870 with Hall of Fame numbers he has.  Yes.  I almost want to just play the Joe Piscopo now.  That's great.  Oh, it was so much fun.  And then I saw you're all over Channel 11 here in New York. 
[01:37:30]  You're all over that, the King of Queens, and then I turn on, and you're at the video store  at Seinfeld.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that role.  That's great, man.  That was my first TV role, and that's the classic first timer on TV.  I'm basically, I'm there just to set up.  Jason and I are doing something funny, and I'm trying to get a laugh from my, like, all  I'm saying is, I'm sorry, sir.  It doesn't work that way.  And I'm putting so much spin on each of my words. 
[01:38:00]  I'm going to make something to myself.  Like, is there any way I can find nothing?  So, this is out.  Someone has it.  Out.  Oh, no.  I've been to four other places.  You're the only ones that have had it.  Well, I can put it on reserve for you if you'd like.  Maybe we could call them and ask them to be an intern.  Oh, sorry.  We can't do that.  Boom.  It's a laugh.  It's a laugh.  I have to go pick it up.  Oh, little attitude.  I don't think so.  It doesn't work that way.  It doesn't work that way.  Oh, damn it. 
[01:38:30]  And there's my back.  Oh, I just.  Wait a minute.  That was one of your first times on TV, though?  That was my very first paid acting gig on TV.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  That was the first one.  That was the first one.  1994.  Good for you.  Wow, man.  And then I got a hell of a start.  Well, after it aired, I got this call from a, not even a friend of mine from, like, this  acquaintance that was like, hey, I checked you out on TV.  I go, oh, hey, thanks, man.  He goes, yeah, you know, I'm thinking, maybe I'm getting in acting now, you know, like I 
[01:39:00]  was thinking about this.  And I go, oh, and this is a guy that never was, and I go, oh, okay.  He goes, yeah, so I'm going to maybe come, if I came out, like I could crash in your spare  room or something.  And I said, well, I, I'm living in a studio apartment.  And I, my bed is in my kitchen and he, and he's like, oh, come on, man.  I just saw you on TV.  And now you're trying to, uh, I go, what do you mean?  He goes, wow, you have a house.  I saw you on TV.  You have a house.  Just because you're, yeah.  And I was like, uh, I've, I made less on that kick than I have one. 
[01:39:30]  Like that basically got me an aftercard.  I didn't even get money off of that.  So people actually will think that I, I was guilty of the same thing with, uh, our own  Greg Opie Hughes here back when, um, I was just doing Opie's show, uh, from seven to  midnight.  That was a big deal as a, as a single broadcaster, sir.  Oh, I didn't.  Out on Long Island.  I was kicking ass on Long Island.  I'll check your Wikipedia page.  WBAB is out on Long Island.  Doing very well for myself.  And, and I would, I would come in like maybe once a week and, and do something. 
[01:40:00]  And then I was like, oh, you want, you know, why don't you come over to my house?  We'll hang out.  I'm like, holy fuck.  This is fucking cool.  And, uh, and he tells me where to go and I'm driving.  I'm like, wait, this isn't, this isn't, this should be like a gated community.  Right.  Right.  And then he, we pull, I pull up to this house and, and, and he's like, Hey, what's up?  And I look around and it's just a shitty house.  And I don't even have the whole house.  No, you don't even have the whole house.  I'm running the top half.  And I'm like, what the fuck? 
[01:40:30]  And then I started thinking, cause it was in Northport and I'm just kind of like, oh,  this must just be a summer home.  Like, I'll be summering in Northport.  Summering.  You know how people go to Northport just to chill out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was an old house, a lot of rusted shit in the yard and the backyard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just like, oh man, I thought.  Gotta deal with a horrible landlord.  He's got his own radio show.  He's got to be wealthy.  What'd you guys do in the house together that day?  Yeah.  We actually watched The Crow.  Did we really?  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  It was The Crow.  There's something so creepy about you guys in the house watching The Crow.  It's so random.  Little did we know the future would be this.  Yeah.  And it was, I remember though, cause it was like, there was no lights on either.  It was really dark.  Of course it was.  You're off the air at midnight.  So what'd you go for a two in the morning fucking brew and crow viewing?  I mean, even in the house, like, like in that little living room area.  I didn't have money to pay the electric bill.  It's so funny.  You guys watching The Crow at two in the morning and you're like, I have plans to conquer New 
[01:41:30]  York.  Talking about what's going to happen.  But it continued in Boston and we were kicking ass together now and we weren't making any money.  No.  We finally made money when we came back to New York.  I realized very quickly that that was a fallacy that if you're on the radio, you're wealthy.  We were huge in Boston and we were still struggling.  Yeah.  More or less.  Yeah.  Opie was living with my mother-in-law.  Yeah.  I lived with her for six months going, fuck that's six months of rent I don't have to deal  with.  Right.  Right.  You can get some savings or something. 
[01:42:00]  Yes.  We moved in.  We all were living there.  Me, my wife at the time and Opie and the mother-in-law living in her little fucking townhouse.  And, uh, but, but my wife and her mother got along so poorly that it was like day one.  She's like, I'm getting the fuck out of here.  I got to get away from this bitch.  And I go to Ed, I'm like, oh, you guys are leaving, but this is great.  I like this.  She cooks dinner.  She actually did my laundry.  I think she made the bed every day when I went to do the radio show with Ed. 
[01:42:30]  I'm like, my chick at the time didn't want to move to Boston.  So I'm like, what the fuck?  I'll just stay where I am.  That's what I was thinking at the time too.  It was kind of like, oh, I could fucking, you know.  You could save up some money.  I don't know.  I don't know how we got into this.  I don't know.  This is depressing.  All the millennials out there.  Yeah.  Can we get off on a different subject right now?  Because, uh, I'm living with my parents.  I have a lot of grief.  God's sakes.  Yes.  The Biscopo Saga.  The Biscopo Saga.  Saga.  Sorry.  I'm looking at the.  I don't even know if you need the visual on that one. 
[01:43:00]  I think you could just pop that.  We play a little.  Oh, you drive it around.  Yeah.  I lived at home until I was 30.  And you know how old?  I remember I met a girl in Vegas.  When I was opening for Dice at the fucking Venetian.  And she thought I was fucking hot shit.  And I was joking with her.  I was being sarcastic.  I'm like, yeah, I got a Jag and a Benz.  And she's like, really?  Oh, no.  She believed it.  And then she fucking.  I flew her to Jersey.  I live with Florentine.  Oh, no.  And I'll never forget when she saw what a fucking hunk of garbage my apartment was.  Because I had the roof leaking. 
[01:43:30]  Remember?  She's like, do you have any vodka?  And I gave her fucking vodka.  And I just taught her chess in my living room.  And it was fucking.  That was your whole fucking.  That was my time.  Wow.  I just feel so bad about that.  It's black mold on the walls.  Yeah.  We did a Cribs with Jim Norton.  We actually went through his place.  Really?  When I was 33 years old.  It was terrible.  It was unbelievable how much mold he had in that joint.  It was terrible.  I love how she immediately goes, do you have any vodka?  Can I just numb this?  Yeah.  That's what it was.  That's what it was.  Well, I'm about to get surgery in the Old West.  Just give me some bourbon.  Let's get this over with. 
[01:44:00]  Where's the Benz?  You've got to tell him real fast before we move on out of the shit, you would bring girls  back to your parents' house.  Well, I was in my late 20s.  Yeah, I'd get blown.  And the fuck.  I remember me and my friend Larry got a fucking pregnant prostitute in my fucking grandmother's  where she's dead, but in her basement.  And this girl sparks up a crack pipe.  She sparks up a fucking crack pipe.  I'll never forget that.  In grandma's house.  Yeah, in one of my parents' houses.  Oh, in your parents' house.  Jim, you casually rushed by about eight horrific things just to get to the point of your story.  I got to blow this pregnant prostitute in my grandma. 
[01:44:30]  She's dead.  So anyway, wait a minute.  We're just rushing by all that shit?  Where are we heading?  Like, what's the kicker of this of all that?  It's like, ah, don't worry about that.  It's just the illusion of wealth people have.  They think that you're doing better in show business.  They have no idea.  Yeah, that is true.  I lived in this house.  Just show them the photo being pulled apart.  I lived in this house until I was doing comedy for 13 years.  10 years to 13 years is when I lived here.  Just a photo.  Don't even show them the whole house.  It's too long.  But just show them the black mold.  Oh, Lord.  There's all the mold on the ceiling. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah, this is online if you guys want to check it out.  Oh, behind that pic picture.  That is disgusting.  Look at it.  The mold is leaking.  Watch when they lift that picture up.  This is so fucking terrible.  Yeah, they were hiding the mold with that picture, obviously.  No.  I don't want to.  Yes.  Yeah, this is where I live, man.  There is mold.  There we go.  Okay, they are lifting a picture up.  Oh, God.  Yep.  Oh, no.  That's like Amityville horror shit right there.  That's a shit load of mold.  Oh, and it's under, of course, a nice framed Chagall. 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  Yeah, that's my framed Chagall.  Isn't that that weird brain-eating mold?  Yeah, it's not stupid.  You have to flee the house once you have it.  That's the black mold, right?  Yes.  Yeah, I think so.  This doesn't seem that long ago.  It's got to be 13 years ago, right?  What are we, in 2013?  Oh, God.  Yeah, it's 13 years ago.  Yeah, I'd been at it probably nearly 20 years before I could afford a house.  There's just not that much. 
[01:46:00]  People see you because you have so much exposure.  People don't realize that fame and fortune are usually completely opposite.  Yeah.  You can be very famous and have zero fortune.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah, it really is a fucking long process to make any kind of fucking real money, man.  People are so disappointed when they realize.  Oh, man.  And you're broke.  If you're on TV, you have a shitload of money.  That's the illusion.  And then when you start making money, one of the first things you have to do is start  paying off all the debt you accrue to even get. 
[01:46:30]  Like, I had so much debt that there was nothing I could do about it.  Like, I have to keep living in this debt because this is the life I'm living.  And then I was, thank God, I was able to finally pay it off.  That's exactly, yes.  That happened to me, too, with credit cards and shit.  But I was like, I just resigned to the fact that I am going to be paying the minimum balance  for the rest of my life.  Oh, yeah.  How many times?  I remember one time, oh, God.  Okay.  I was in San Francisco.  My phone got cut off because I hadn't paid the bill.  So I got to walk down. 
[01:47:00]  I was rolling nickels in quarters.  I had this huge bucket of change.  And I sat there for a few hours and rolled enough to literally, I had like $200 in nickels.  So I had them in a big bag, a trash bag.  And I walked down to the office, the phone company office, where you literally can pay  it in person and get it turned on right there.  Yeah.  So I'm lugging this trash bag down Clement Street so I can go pay my bill.  And there's this kid, I was like 20 at the time.  He was like 17, a able-bodied, totally healthy young kid begging on Clement Street. 
[01:47:30]  Just like, hey, are you getting changed?  Like, just again, this is like early 90s.  And I was like, I am really sorry.  I don't have any money.  And I actually stopped.  There's no reason to talk to this idiot.  And I'm like, I got to go pay this phone.  I have just enough to pay it.  I got to get my phone turned back on.  And I, because I'm trying to be a member of society, you able-bodied young man.  So then I go to the office, I pay it.  But I was like, I had like 87 cents left. 
[01:48:00]  Like, oh, I actually had more than I thought.  I was so happy that when I was going back, I passed him.  And I went, hey man, look, I got some change.  And I gave him my change because I was in such a good mood.  Oh, man.  And then he stopped and he went, you said you were broke, you fucking asshole.  Ah, Jesus.  Holy shit.  So, okay, that's got it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You don't realize people can rip you off on credit cards too.  That's a problem.  Like, do you get into credit card debt?  I was like, I had $3,000 on each one.  And then all of a sudden I had like a $10,000 hit. 
[01:48:30]  Wow.  I used to go to these prostitutes and pay with a credit card.  I never, I really would.  It would never occur to me that they would rip you off.  Oh, really?  The prostitutes wouldn't rip you off.  Yeah.  So I had to call and fucking get $10,000 for the fucking bullshit charges taking off my credit cards.  Well, that's weird because you haven't seen the Jim Memorial, Jim Norton Memorial.  You know, thank you from all the prostitutes for all the rice cookers and, you know, laundry machines.  You bought them.  There's a whole, oh, that joke went fucking, oh, my God. 
[01:49:00]  I could not have been sweatier or clankier.  Jim, did you see the, one time, oh, fuck.  Clankier.  I literally limped my way towards a non-punch line, right?  I threw out a dumb story that there really was nowhere to go with.  I gave you the beginning, middle, and end.  There's nowhere to go with it.  Why?  That's an amazing story without the details.  Who cares?  I didn't even mention there were trannies.  I mean, believe me.  That guy wouldn't even throw that in.  But Jim's face was literally, he was, I was like, again, I was like a special kid. 
[01:49:30]  I'm going to get down with him.  Let's let him tell his story.  And then, when you, oh, God.  Jimmy, when a pregnant hooker shows up, are you pissed?  She didn't show up.  We picked her up.  Oh, Christ.  She was a street worker.  How pregnant?  Eight and a half months, nine months.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, no bullshit.  There was no other hookers walking around?  No problem with it?  I don't remember why we did that.  I remember she blew both of us.  She blew me and Larry, and then she sparked up a crack pipe right by my grandmother's old  bookcase, and she had a copy of Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye in the bookcase. 
[01:50:00]  I thought JFK.  Maybe they were just, Jimmy and his friend were reading The Good Earth.  They're like, oh, the scene where she gets birthed in the rice field.  Let's just try to recreate that.  Was there any guilt?  Yeah, a little bit.  That she was eight and a half, nine months pregnant?  Yeah, no, it was the drugs.  I felt bad about it.  I was like, ah, man.  It's like, you ever smoke coke when it's being cooked?  It's a fucking, it's a very distinct odor.  It was where my parents would fucking smell it.  Oh, man.  Were they upstairs at the time? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  You bring a fucking pregnant hooker into the downstairs part of the house when your parents,  I remember being nervous, like just having a girl over on the couch doing normal fucking  shit.  You know, making out and dry humping.  You were worried they were going to come check it out, right?  What was that?  What was that?  Is that not a pregnant hooker smoking crack next to Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye?  I can't wait until Jim gets his Louie style show and his pitching stories.  Yeah.  Well, so in this episode, if there's a pregnant, oh, like three months. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, no.  Nine.  She's got to be nine.  Like, right.  Wow.  Should we smoke and crack?  Trust me.  Jim already has that show written and is just trying to get rid of it.  Can we get the clearance to use the book, Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye?  I need that in the shot.  I need that to frame the left side of her face.  Yeah.  Because she's doing it.  The camera has to pan to that before commercial.  So, Pat, what are you promoting?  We didn't have any mention of Pat's promoting you.  Oh, right, yeah.  Whatever happened to Moby Dick?  Is that a book you've written?  Yeah.  I'm saying.  No.  Oh, I'm – there's two things I'm doing. 
[01:51:30]  The next Tuesday is the season two premiere of The Heart She Holler, which is an adult  swim show that the guys – they did Wonder Shows.  I don't know if you ever watch Wonder Showsen.  It's – Wonder Showsen is amazing.  It's this – it's like a – it's like if Sesame Street were on bath salts and they  go and just drive people in New York insane and do – they have these things like kids  on the street, kids on the beat, beat kids, beat kids. 
[01:52:00]  And it's like kids doing the news.  So there's a kid.  They address a kid as Hitler.  And then he's talking to me like, what's wrong with – what do you think is wrong with  the youth of today?  Like these old people are like, why are you addressing Hitler?  Like they're so upset.  And then they also send this kid to the racetrack to talk to just these old people to racetrack.  And this one little kid is like, I can do an impression of you.  And this sweet old man is like, really?  Yeah.  Gamble, gamble, gamble, die.  So those guys did this show called The Heart She Holler, which is like – think of the 
[01:52:30]  most annoying Brooklyn hipster and what they think the South is, they think a red state  is, and then give that person bath salts, and that's what the show is.  It's just this insane inbred.  And we did six episodes two years ago, and Adult Swim liked it so much, they went, why  don't you do 14 more?  We're going to run them every single night of the month like a soap opera.  Oh, shit.  So it's just weird.  They're each like 11 minutes long, and it's the most – 
[01:53:00]  Nice.  They do short shows on Adult Swim, right?  They do very short – yeah.  And it has that nice, like, cool – if it's only 11 minutes, just do 11 minutes.  Make it great.  Yeah, yeah.  And it is the most disgusting shit I've ever done on camera.  Oh, wow.  The weirdest shit I've ever done.  If you want to watch, like, people crawling into women's vaginas and a woman – there's  a scene they showed last night.  They did a thing at the Nighthawk in Brooklyn where a guy – oh, God, this is so gross. 
[01:53:30]  I'll base – I'll just put it this way.  He – she – a woman does him from behind because something is sticking out of his rear  that she is riding, but – and I'll just leave it at that.  It's horrifying.  I would gather.  Is she sharing a dildo with his asshole in her vagina?  You know what?  See, that would be nice.  No.  It's something –  Oh, nice.  A very solid log.  Thank you.  Wow.  I didn't want to be the one to say it, so –  I get soft with this shit.  But it's brilliant. 
[01:54:00]  It is a brilliant show.  And then the – and then, now that I've said all that, next Saturday, the 21st in L.A.,  I'm doing – the Los Angeles Public Library is doing this celebration of Moby Dick.  Wow.  Look at that.  You're all over.  So I'm doing three readings.  I'm just going to go to three different libraries and read sections from Moby Dick,  which – they've sent me these sections.  I mean, I've never read all of Moby Dick.  I'm going to –  Oh, Patton.  Oh, sorry.  That is a seriously fucked up book. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Some of the stuff that goes on in that book.  It's just pages and pages of just psychosis.  So I'm going to be reading some of the weirdest parts because I'm doing this whole thing.  Are you going to put on a dramatic reading voice?  I think I'm going to put on – I'm going to try to, and then I'm going to get confused  and angry because these passages are really, really weird.  I didn't know that Herman Melville was so –  Twisted.  Yeah, twist, like this damaged guy.  How long is his passage?  Each – like a page and a half.  Like really quick, and then I'll talk to the audience about like what the hell just happened. 
[01:55:00]  Like – and there'll be people there that, you know, there's – there's already people  like – because I was announcing it on Twitter, and then they're like, hey, make sure to read  this passage because – and like I've been looking some of them up, and they're really  hard.  Oh, there's some twisted shit in there like this fucking Captain and the Cabin Boy and shit.  There's a lot of like – there's all this – there's all these references, or at least  they allude to the idea that he's gone to – he hates this whale so much that he's  gone to all these islands of different savages, and he's storing these like Zoroastrians and 
[01:55:30]  these crazy religious fanatics, but he keeps them stored like under the decks, and they  just sit there smoking weed all day and going crazy, and the minute the whale services,  he's going to like let these maniacs loose to go kill this thing.  What the fuck?  So on the deck of the ship is Queequeg and Ishmael and all these guys, but then underneath  of it, it's like the gathering of the Juggalos, and he's just giving them all PCP, and they're  going to go kill this thing.  Throw them out like a cluster bomb of savages. 
[01:56:00]  Exactly.  It's amazing.  I had no idea.  I've never read the book.  No, I haven't either.  I know nothing about Hoby Dick.  I think I might have to read that one.  That's cool.  I just hear the name and giggle.  Yeah.  Can't help it.  Well, also what I didn't know about the book was Herman Melville was this hugely successful  like killer diller author of money, fame, and then he spent all these years writing his  great American, and it ruined him, and he died penniless and kind of crazy.  Yeah.  Wow.  This thing just ate him alive, and he wouldn't, and they put it out. 
[01:56:30]  Everyone hated it.  All their viewers were like, this is the worst, most unreadable piece of shit.  Fuck.  This guy flushed his career down the toilet.  When did it become a classic?  I think like 50 years after he was dead.  Wow.  Yeah, it was really weird.  He just kind of blew it.  Damn.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a guy, like imagine, think of like Bruce Springsteen, and then all of a sudden  for the, like, he stops doing music for 10 years, and then comes out with this weird 
[01:57:00]  atonal, like he's just banging on like a weird, like a Dixie cup with a mummified penis  for four hours, and everyone's like, that's it?  It's all I'm doing from now on.  They're like, God, he's gone.  And then he just ends up like dying in a men's hotel somewhere.  But then 50 years later, people dig that.  They're like, this is the greatest album ever.  Do you know the history of how it turned it around and how it became a classic?  That I don't know.  I still got to read that part because it's an amazing, it is a fascinating story about a guy  burning his life to the ground, and then that becomes a thing he's, and then his big 
[01:57:30]  bestseller books no one gives a shit about, that were bestsellers during his lifetime,  no one reads anymore, no one cares.  When did he, what was his life and death years, roughly?  I don't know that part.  Did he die in the 1900s or the 1800s?  I think he died in the late 1800s, but don't quote me.  Yeah, there you go.  Get on Wikipedia.  I'm going to have to do that.  Yeah.  He's also, his other big, one of his big bestsellers was called UMO, O-O-M-O, and if you  do crossword puzzles, you see that a lot.  Yeah.  Just as Melville novel, oh, this person needs vowels in his puzzle, so here comes UMO. 
[01:58:00]  Get no UMO, because that's going to be the one in there.  Well, you got 1819 to 1891.  I lived to fucking, what was he, 73?  Almost made it.  72 years old, right?  Lived a long life, died miserable.  You doing animation still?  Yeah, I do.  Well, you know, now, because my daughter is four, and we watch all these animated shows,  and then sometimes I'll tweet about them, like, I can't get the Doc McStuffins tune out of my head. 
[01:58:30]  Of course.  And then they'll call me and go, hey, you want to do a voice?  I'm like, yeah.  All of your favorite, like, 90s musicians are all doing kid shows now.  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is They Might Be Giants.  They do all the music.  Doc McStuffins is that girl from Letters to Cleo.  Oh, shit.  And she's, like, this big songwriter.  So it's, like, all of your alt-90 darlings.  That's where they went.  Oh, yeah, they all went there.  They knew where, like, there's cash in that, right?  Oh, my God.  It's crazy.  Like, they all, they don't have to tour. 
[01:59:00]  They're happy.  It's got to be easier to write.  My son's go-to movie in the car is Ratatouille.  So when I saw Patton, I'm like, can I just choke you, please?  I'm so sorry.  Because when these kids latch on to a movie, they will not let go for a long time.  I will say, though, that that's a very smart kid that can watch Ratatouille at age three.  He loves it.  Although he makes us fast forward through the scary parts, the whole rainstorm in the beginning and stuff.  Well, just, yeah, yeah.  Because, and the shotgun, like, that's really dark. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, he knows when, you know, he's like.  Scary part.  Yeah, but he doesn't want to turn it off.  He goes, just fast forward for me.  Yeah, I want to see the rest of it.  That's crazy.  Just be happy that, because one of the things my daughter is into is that Dora the Explorer.  That's okay.  Dora the Explorer?  You like Dora the Explorer?  How much do you like it?  One, two, three.  He knows.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  For us, it's Caillou.  Caillou.  Caillou's the whiny little, he's a whiny little fuck. 
[02:00:00]  And then I hear my son imitating Caillou.  I'm like, no, you're not going to imitate Caillou.  Yeah, and also that a lot of these.  I hate Caillou.  That's the only one I can't stand out of all the kids' programs.  Yeah, and she loves Caillou.  And that little theme, that weird.  I'm Caillou.  I've heard that, yeah.  Do you do animation voices, Jim?  Because you have an amazing voice for animation.  You should be doing voiceovers.  Thank you.  I wish there was somebody else in my career that felt that way.  A person of power or influence that was managing me. 
[02:00:30]  Thank you.  When you guys were playing the early Jim Norton thing with that voice, it sounded like you  were doing a voice.  Yeah.  How we doing?  Oh, I should have had my throat cut.  Ah, yeah.  That's back at, was that here?  We did that at NW.  It was just played over Best Of.  Yeah, yeah.  It was amazing.  Who came in?  Patrice fucking Voss?  Yeah, they were all, it was like they brought in the Magnificent Seven of Ball Busters and 
[02:01:00]  then found the most embarrassing thing.  Like it was the perfect storm for ball busting.  That's exactly it.  We've done a few of those over the years.  They're very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  We've played some of our old radio shows from the beginning.  You don't get through like four words before somebody just jumps in and starts pounding  you.  Whoa, what?  Yeah.  It's so brutal.  It's humiliating.  Jimmy's voice.  Mine was terrible.  Ah, yeah, people.  Oh, like me, like me, like me, like me.  What were you, they weren't, what were you dressed in? 
[02:01:30]  Like, how were you dressed?  What were you wearing?  Um, it should have been a fucking suit with my hands over my chest and a sack pillow.  I was wearing fucking baggy purple, like fucking workout pants.  No!  Oh, dude, I was a, I was a cunt and a fucking black, like, mock turtle.  I was a, I was a, just a zilch.  An absolute zero.  At the time you thought you looked good, though.  Oh, my God, I sure did.  High energy, smiling, you know, they're like, they're enjoying me.  Always greet them with a smile and be totally inclusive. 
[02:02:00]  I listened to them.  No one left out.  You hear that like me shit that you gotta be likable, you gotta be likable.  When you first start, you hear that, and you know, you want the industry to like, it's  all this nonsense you buy into that, thank God, some of us get out of.  Well, how much nonsense, remember when you would buy into the idea that if you fuck up  at this club or anger this club, in your mind, it's a network.  Right, right.  We all talk to each other, and you'll be banned from all, like, suddenly you have a cabaret  card that's 1961, and you'll be banned, and then you realize later, oh, they were, it 
[02:02:30]  would have actually helped my career if certain club owners had hated me immediately.  Yeah.  Because it would have, the word would have gotten out that, oh, this guy's actually  good if this asshole doesn't like him.  Or he hates him, or, yeah, fuck him.  There's no loyalty.  You can burn down the Cleveland improv, and it'd still hire you in Baltimore.  Yeah, they don't give a shit.  They really don't.  So, yeah, there was always that, ugh, so frustrating.  How do you know, like, when you're starting out like that, what to even wear?  Like, oh, I'm wearing these purple things.  Like, was it calculated?  Did you go into that closet and be like, tonight I'm on stage, let me get that. 
[02:03:00]  Or did you just throw on what was clean?  A club owner gave me them.  This guy, Mark Vito, who runs Club Casbah, and Wally Wildwood gave me a couple of baggy pants.  I just thought they were kind of cool, and I would tuck my shirt in.  Here's the one I wore during my fight with you, Rock.  Here's the one, Rock Vito shorts.  Exactly.  I would always try to, like, wear the, I would always try to dress, like, in the subtle comedian uniform.  Yeah.  So it's, like, maybe, like, the suit jacket, but then the jeans, and then the bright sneakers. 
[02:03:30]  Like, come on, he's a little, you don't know what's going to come out of this guy.  He's dressed for fun.  And then the t-shirt under the suit jacket with a weird, ironic logo on it, you know.  Look, it's the Mr. Bubble logo.  I'm nuts.  We don't know what I'm going to do.  I mean, if I'm willing to put this on, what's going to happen?  Oh, Jesus.  It's so pathetic.  So needy.  There's nothing, that's what's hard about watching you when you're yourself and young. 
[02:04:00]  It's not that you're not funny, it's that you're needy.  You're so needy.  It was both.  Yeah.  I was not funny, and I was needy.  That's that.  When we were going through old radio stuff, I was literally months out of doing construction.  So I was just so happy.  But you get a pass.  I'm like, oh, my God.  So everything was so, like, oh, yeah, yeah, over the top.  I was just so eager to, like anything, I'd throw in an imitation. 
[02:04:30]  Dude, I must perform.  Because the attic was waiting for you.  Yes, that attic was.  You kind of have a pass.  You came out of nowhere.  This kid.  This kid.  He came out of nowhere, though.  But it is, you know.  I'm not a kid on Vulcan.  And that's where he's going.  I started this shit when I was 18.  He can't.  He's in his 30s.  Comes out of nowhere.  Fucking boom.  Oh, he's.  Boom.  You know what his advantage was and yours, too, is because you started young and you started  from with the past you had. 
[02:05:00]  You had this cliff of darkness behind you.  There's nothing to fall back on.  Yes.  So you've got to work twice.  It makes you work twice as hard when you have got nothing else.  We both had nothing.  Like I had when I started doing stand up, I kind of blew everything else.  Right.  And I realized I can't work in every office I got.  I worked in.  Either people hated me or I hated it.  I had a terrible attitude because it's just like I have a cliff to my back.  Yeah.  If I fall back, I will fall off the planet.  Just gone. 
[02:05:30]  So you're one of those people that, well, they fell through the cracks of society.  I literally that's where I would have ended up.  I would.  Yeah.  All those guys almost made it.  Oh, yeah.  Because that's the other side of this.  Those guys that almost made it but had the cliff at their back and they fucking fell.  How many comedic geniuses do we know?  Truly visionary guys that just never – they're just gone.  Or they're still around, but what do you do?  They made bad decisions, a lot of them.  A lot of people wanted to just work.  The big road headliners of like 1992 – I started in 1990. 
[02:06:00]  And a lot of those guys began in the 80s.  And they headlined before they were ready because the 80s had a fucking million clubs, so everyone got the headline.  Oh, yeah.  And then they got bottlenecks squeezed out in the fucking early 90s and they couldn't find work.  And like those guys that would work in like 92, 93, they're gone now.  Yeah.  A lot of those rooms weren't around.  It's amazing.  So also they got used to a certain lifestyle of I make this much money, I do this.  And the people that survived when the boom stopped – and there were people that did make it. 
[02:06:30]  But those are the ones who are like I got to get some other shitty job and keep doing stand-up until it comes around again.  Yeah, yeah.  Some people did do that.  But you're right.  There were some people that were like I used to headline at – yeah, I used to headline at a club chain that does not exist.  It doesn't even exist anymore.  And no one cares.  Yeah, yeah.  And there were also those guys that – well, you know, they wrote their 45 minutes and then they just – so I'm done writing.  Yep, exactly.  I got my 45.  That's my life.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  My life's comic book.  I don't understand those guys.  Why would I go on stage for no money?  You see some of those guys come through, you know, once a year and you go see them and you're like, what are you doing? 
[02:07:00]  It's the same thing.  Same exact thing.  Isn't it fun?  I thought it was fun writing jokes.  That was the whole point of doing this.  You get to – you have to do the same shit over and over again.  New stuff.  Yeah.  Those guys are – I'm merciless with those guys.  They're fucking lazy.  Yeah.  It's like you're fucking lazy.  Yeah.  Fucking write a joke or try a joke.  They were the same fucking dog shit inflection for 10 years.  Oh, fuck you.  Fuck you.  On HBO – I think it's HBO Classic, Comedy, whatever the fuck it is. 
[02:07:30]  They play a lot of the old specials from the 80s and stuff and you see these guys and you're like, oh, yeah, that guy.  And he had like a little fame back then.  And you realize you never saw this guy after like the boom of stand-up comedy.  It's just – they're gone.  Are they – I was going to ask, are they still doing comedy but in some weird fucking places?  Who the fuck even knows?  They just disappear.  I don't even know.  Some of them just disappear, man.  A lot of them – a lot of the guys that I started with in D.C., these headliners, ended up on morning radio doing AM. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, really?  Not like satellite stuff, but I mean like AM, local, and angry, like beyond conservative.  You know, because – like there was a guy – I remember a guy that I used to work with and we weren't really friends, worked with him, and he was going off about – well, you know, I used to be a comedian and black people in clubs.  Let me tell you something because I've actually experienced it.  I'm like –  Was it Kramer?  It was – but it was like I see what you're saying, but you're basing four – you're basing a political philosophy on three bad nights that you had at Garvin's, which, by the way, were bad nights. 
[02:08:30]  But you need to like – and like that was his argument with the – yeah.  Oh, God.  You ever do Garvin's?  No, but I remember the name from D.C.  Garvin's was – their big claim to fame, they're gone, is that they had Dave Chappelle starting out.  He got his start there, and they treated him like such absolute dog shit.  Yeah.  That he left for New York, and then I remember a club, another club, not Garvin's, but one a lot like Garvin's. 
[02:09:00]  Dave Chappelle was getting ready for his first hour, the Killingham Softly, and he called – his managers called the club and said, Dave would like to do the weekend.  You can have him for $800 for the whole weekend.  He just wants to do sets.  You know, this is the last minute.  All you got to do is give him $800.  So, you know, this is Dave Chappelle, right?  He probably just wanted some money to fucking grab some food or pay for his own.  Yeah, exactly.  And they wouldn't pay him.  They wouldn't do it.  And then I heard the two managers talking, and one of them was like, fucking kid used to emcee here for $25 a set five years ago. 
[02:09:30]  And so we got to give him $800.  It's like, well, because he's not the kid you – like, in their mind, you're just frozen there.  Yeah, yeah, you're still the same piece.  How great is it they're gone?  How great is it they're there?  Oh, they're all – the whole thing just collapsed.  That's great.  Yeah, yeah.  It is nice when you get a club from a scumbag club owner running it, and then it just goes belly up.  Good.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Oh, it's the – 
[02:10:00]  It happened with bands, too.  When we used to play, and at the end of the night, you go to get paid, and there's always a problem.  You know, well, you know, we had the door count, and it was this.  It's like we had our own guy with it.  You know, I got to go with my guy, and you're like, you're just – you're really going to screw me on 25 people, you prick.  Like, you do realize this can't sustain.  Like, eventually, your club is just going to collapse.  Right, right, right.  There's no way if you keep pissing the talent off, no one will come back here. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, just fucking everyone over.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fascinating.  And they all try to.  They all try to fuck you for eight seats or ten seats.  Or, you know, we're doing a golden ticket thing, you know, but you aren't supposed to because we have a contracted ticket price.  They all try to get an extra few dollars.  See, that's what – again, if they were trying to fuck me over for 20 grand, I would at least respect that I'm dealing with a supervillain.  But when you're dealing with someone – I mean, like, you're – I just talked to you for 20 minutes because you were trying to get, like, $48 out of me. 
[02:11:00]  That's what drives me crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  That much.  And it's weird when you have these, like, old clubs that, like, for years you worked in, and then you realize that it's 2013, and you're going back October 11 and 12 to the Comedy Cabaret at Poco's Restaurant in Doylestown.  Oh, Jimmy.  Tickets are on sale now.  I'm working on my new hour, so I'm just going – and tickets are cheaper. 
[02:11:30]  We're doing $15 tickets.  I wanted to do $10 tickets, but they couldn't do them because they make no liquor money.  And it's where I want to go just to work.  I'm going to have, like, maybe some paper with me and just work on material.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  No, when I was doing this, I just taped my new special in July, and I did the same thing.  There was a – I did a – every Thursday night, I did – there's this little art gallery near me that also does stand-up.  And I go, let me just have Thursday nights.  And I got to go there every night for three months.  And then I would also go every Monday – one Monday and Tuesday morning, I would go down to the Irvine Improv, which is in a mall. 
[02:12:00]  And you've got to edit your shit.  Like, you can't just go, let's just see where this goes.  Like, no.  They want to see a show.  So all the stuff that I would kind of spew out at the art gallery, I then had to go edit down in Irvine.  Oh, wow.  That's a great idea.  And it really helped.  It was really good.  Yeah, yeah.  That's really smart.  Yeah, I love doing stuff like that.  I usually do that right before a specialist shot.  Like, I'll usually go into smaller rooms and just completely – but that's – you know, you're seeing the special almost.  This is – I probably have, since I shot, probably 35 new minutes. 
[02:12:30]  Already?  Yeah, about – wow.  It's been five months.  It's been five months.  Oh, man.  35 new months.  But 35 new minutes.  So I would say, you know, you'll have close to a new 45, and I'll play with the crowd a little bit.  But I love doing that.  That's great.  It's my favorite part of it.  So I saw Colin in Long Island City when he was just starting working on the last –  Unconstitutional, yeah.  Yeah, Unconstitutional.  No kidding.  And it was fucking – it was great.  Just watch him, and he'd go through something and be like, oh, well, that don't work.  But it was great just watching him throw that shit around and try to fix it. 
[02:13:00]  And he says the same thing on HBO, and he does it.  Come on, let me go over.  God, how fucking funny is he?  He's the best.  It's amazing.  It's depressing.  It really is.  Fantastic.  I could do maybe one joke on the Constitution, and it would wind up being about Ben Franklin's gay socks.  And he didn't even write the Constitution.  You know, speaking of funny, we do have Jake LaMotta coming in today.  Oh, man.  For real?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  If you want to stick around.  If you'll let me.  If not, I'll totally leave.  But God damn.  He's doing comedy, too.  He's 92.  So he's up on the stage where that bull can rage?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although I can fight, I'd much rather hear myself for sight.  I can't remember.  Oh.  Not pretty.  That was brutal.  Does he really do a comedy, though?  Yeah, he did it for years.  Yeah, oh, God, yeah.  No, I know, but he's 92.  Well.  He comes with his wife. 
[02:14:00]  Isn't Rickles in his 90s?  No, he's 80.  Rickles, yeah, but Rickles also wasn't belted in the head by Sugar Ray Robertson.  No, it's a total of 106 rounds.  Good point, Jimmy.  No, yeah, good point.  Very good.  We'll be right back on Point Counterpoint.  Well, if you're sticking around, why don't we take a break?  Yeah, he'll be in a few minutes.  Yeah, so, yeah, Pat, stay around.  What's the big plug again?  It's whatever happened to Moby Dick, right?  That's whatever happened to Moby Dick on the 21st.  Okay.  And then the Heart She Holler second season on Tuesday the 10th. 
[02:14:30]  I'm going to check out that series.  I had never heard of it until today.  If you like fluids, you'll like the Heart She Holler.  And Patton Oswalt on Twitter, he's a really good one to follow.  So, we'll continue with Patton.  Stay there.  Thank you.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius X.  See?  Told you we had sponsors.  And now, back to The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:15:00]  Back.  We are back.  Oh, God.  Patton Oswalt hanging with us, and we couldn't be happier.  And right now, we've got a legend walking through the studio.  That was Travis.  Walking into the studio.  The great Jake.  You want to say it, Jimmy?  Jake LaMotta.  LaMotta.  Oh, boy.  And his wife's with him, I'm sure.  It's going to be a very old.  Why is it going to be a minute?  What happened?  He has to wait for his wife to come back. 
[02:15:30]  There we go.  Never mind.  There we go.  Hey, Jake LaMotta.  I don't fear the champ is here.  I don't fear the champ is here.  Take a seat, Jake.  Take a seat, Jake.  Jake LaMotta.  Taking a seat.  Yes.  All right, sir.  There you go.  What's up, Jake?  Wheel up.  Man.  The legend.  Legend my ass.  Oh.  Legend my ass. 
[02:16:00]  I like that.  I can't sit down.  No, huh?  Do you want him to help you out?  Why don't you help me out, Travis?  And stop.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  Drop in.  Drop in.  You're good.  You're not going to fall back.  Okay.  There you go.  Is that good?  Are you good?  What are you?  Pushing closer.  Do you need the chair lowered?  What's that with you, Travis?  Okay.  Does that work?  That's good.  Well, Jake LaMotta.  Can I hold this so we can push the seat?  I, uh, wow.  What a, first of all, your career.  I have no fear the champ is here. 
[02:16:30]  I have no fear the champ is here.  That's, what do you want to know?  Just ask me.  Um, how did, why did you fight Sugar Ray Robinson three weeks apart?  I fought Sugar Ray Robinson so many times, I wonder I don't have diabetes.  Ah, there it is.  Sugar.  See, sugar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How come you guys fought three weeks apart?  Why, why so close together the fights?  Well, it was obvious at that time it wasn't that big a deal. 
[02:17:00]  Today, make a big deal out of it.  But we fought three weeks apart.  I remember that fight.  Three weeks?  I fought Sugar Ray so many times, it's one that I don't have diabetes.  Yeah.  Wow.  Are you, are you, do you, do you think fighters today are softer because they don't fight as 
[02:17:30]  often?  They don't fight as often.  As you guys did, right.  Yeah.  Well, I, I feel that you're in better human shape already, so why not take advantage of  it?  I fought Sugar Ray three weeks.  Three weeks, I found him again.  When you.  The greatest fighter, powerful fighter that ever lived, Sugar Ray Robinson.  I mean, he was a great fighter.  And you took great pride in the fact that he never knocked you down. 
[02:18:00]  Only my, only my, only my wife, only my wife knocked me down.  And there was the one time you went down, at the very end, first time in over a hundred  fights.  I never went down.  No?  No.  What about, uh.  You had to get it all wrong.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wait, how about Danny Nardico?  Danny Nardico.  That was a slip.  Oh, it was a slip? 
[02:18:30]  Okay.  Ah.  Okay.  Nardico was a bum.  No, it was a tough.  No, it was a good fighter.  Oh, okay.  Good knockout.  Knockout.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I fought all the tough guys.  All the guys, nobody else wanted to fight.  I fought them.  Who, uh, who was the hardest hitter?  My wives.  I fought them for so many times. 
[02:19:00]  But there were six wives.  Six wives?  All right.  You're crazy.  Wow.  My first wife, my first wife, my first wife died from eating mushrooms.  Oh, yeah?  My second wife died from eating mushrooms also.  My third wife died from a fractured skull.  She refused to eat the mushrooms.  Okay.  I hope all this is going on in the air.  This is going on in the air. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  This is going out.  Oh, no, you can curse.  It's okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can say whatever you want on here.  How, uh, how accurate was Raging Bull?  I mean, I know that it was your friend Pete, not your brother.  How's Denise?  She should be in the air.  She's right here.  She's right there.  Oh.  That doesn't mean dust her out. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, no.  She has her right hand, left hand.  She's like, yeah.  She's lovely, yeah.  She's a, now, do you need a woman who can kind of, you know, are you difficult?  Is he, uh, we have to get a mic on her.  Yeah, let's mic up.  Yeah.  There's got to be somebody in here in the studio.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Where's everybody?  What are they doing outside?  Ran away.  Do you want to sit here and use this mic?  Oh, Patton.  Oh, come on here.  Look at you.  From the south. 
[02:20:30]  Giving up your seat for a lady.  Besides, I told him I'd give him a couple of cops.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  There you go.  Just get Pat in the microphone.  There she is.  Okay.  Hi.  I can bounce, I can bounce off easy.  What's that?  She's nice to bounce off of.  Oh, yeah.  She's nice to bounce off of?  Oh, wow.  All right, Jake.  Good for you.  How did you two meet?  We met at P.J. Clark's about 20 years ago.  Oh, here in the city?  Yeah.  Okay.  And did Jake approach you, or did you approach him?  Well, he kept beckoning me over to him. 
[02:21:00]  I don't know if you've been to P.J. Clark's at that time.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  And I said to my friend, Patty, the bartender, who is that old man who keeps beckoning me  over to him?  He said, that's Jake LaMotta.  I said, who's Jake LaMotta?  So, after about eight times, I went over and we shook hands, and he was a nice fella.  He made me laugh.  I went home.  I was traveling.  I went back to Arizona.  And then, anyway, we became friends.  And about a year later, I moved back here.  And we've been together pretty much ever since. 
[02:21:30]  Now, when you watch Raging Bull, does it concern you that this is the guy?  Because, you know, it was a very, probably a different Jake now than then, but it's...  You know, you can't teach an old dog new tricks.  Right.  So, he's very much more calm now, but, you know, he was deaf for most of his life, and  I think a lot of his anger came out of not understanding what people were saying.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  He still is.  He wears a hearing aid. 
[02:22:00]  He has 70% loss in his right ear, and he has about 70% use of his left ear.  Oh, I didn't...  Okay, I didn't...  They didn't say that in the...  No, nobody really knows that except his family.  And now, Jake, are you doing...  A few more people now.  Yeah.  Jake, Jake, are you doing stand-up shows, or what kind of live shows are you doing?  I do regular comedy.  I don't know what you call it. 
[02:22:30]  It's regular comedy.  Just going out and doing a regular act.  Yeah.  When you...  I got caught sugar in so many times, it's the ones I don't have diabetes.  Sugar?  Sugar?  Yeah.  Now, when you started doing...  When did you start doing a nightclub act?  About 10 years ago.  I think about 10 years ago.  I don't know, honey.  I think, you know, Bobby played you doing your... 
[02:23:00]  Starting your stand-up act, but he told me that it was when he was doing it badly.  He has great timing.  We do a little cabaret act.  He shadow boxes.  He does stand-up, and we'd do a dance.  My wife never knew I was an alcoholic, until one night I came home sober.  I'll tell you one thing I found out while drinking.  You're never drunk if you could lay on the floor without holding on. 
[02:23:30]  I drink whiskey from a bottle or from an old tomato can, because I know whiskey will never kill you.  But it's an old tomato can.  You know what it means to come home to a beautiful, lovely, gorgeous lady who gives you a lot of love, affection, tenderness.  It means you've been in the wrong goddamn old house.  Fair enough, she hasn't gotten any better. 
[02:24:00]  All right. 
[02:24:30]  I was afraid I thought I said that joke earlier.  No, no.  No, no, not at all.  That's all right.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter to me.  Yeah, please.  I forget quickly anyway.  We're just happy you're here.  So, you know, what do you do with yourself now?  I mean, you know, obviously you're out and about.  You're promoting.  I mean, what is a typical Jake LaMotta day at age 92?  91.  91.  Sorry, I didn't mean to get a line there.  At age 91.  You've got to ask the boss. 
[02:25:00]  What does he do?  Yeah.  Yeah, what does he do on a daily basis?  Oh, on a typical day.  He wakes up, goes to the store, buys the papers, shadow boxes a little bit, reads the paper,  eats a little breakfast.  Do you still watch boxing at all?  Do you still watch it or do you lose interest?  No, I watch it occasionally.  How about UFC, Mixed Martial Arts?  Do you like that or no?  I've seen it once, I think.  Hmm.  You liked it or no?  Yeah, I like it. 
[02:25:30]  Who do you like in boxing?  Sugar Ray Robinson.  Oh, good.  Anybody that's, have you, you fought him, right?  Oh, yeah.  I fought him so many times.  It's the one that don't have five pieces.  Oh, my God, that's a great line.  Oh, Jake.  So, we do want to tell you that we're sitting at the Metropolitan Room on Friday.  Nice.  September 13th, Friday the 13th, 7 p.m.  It's a return engagement, so please come and tell all your friends. 
[02:26:00]  And then, on Sunday, September 15th, Jake will be appearing at the Orchard Beach Classic  Car Show in the Bronx.  He's going back to his native Bronx.  So, everybody can come out and see him there.  Signing things and just kind of, you know, is he doing anything at the car show?  He's signing.  Oh, he is signing?  Oh, cool.  Yeah, having pictures taken.  Yeah, I have a photo with Jake I've got to get signed.  I mean, you know, a chance to get Jake LaMotta to sign something, you know.  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty special.  Yeah, yeah.  It really is.  And you know he has a documentary coming out. 
[02:26:30]  That's our documentarian right there.  Whoa.  Filming.  And also a new movie.  That's going to get stuff today.  Called Bronx Bull by an independent company.  Right.  Bronx Bull was kind of the sequel to Raging Bull.  No, it has nothing to do with Raging Bull.  Oh, it doesn't?  Jimmy.  I just thought, I was, no, no, I didn't think so.  But the dumb listeners did.  So I speak from these dummies' point of view.  So their voice is being heard.  Right, right.  I told you blithering idiots this twice.  Sorry.  Jesus.  Sometimes I put myself.  It's an independent film and it starts when Jake is 15 and comes all the way up to meeting 
[02:27:00]  me.  Wow.  So when you met Jake and this guy is waving you over.  Yeah.  Do you have to kind of go back and.  So funny.  He was wearing, it was 1992 and he was wearing a baby blue leisure suit, you know, from the  70s and he was beckoning me over and I just, I didn't know who he was and finally I went  over and said hello and Praz was there, his friend who was dressed to the nines and all  of us weren't feeling any pain. 
[02:27:30]  So we had a, you know, laugh and then I, like I said, I went home to Arizona, which is where  I was from at that point and I still have property there and about a year later, well,  things happen in life and I moved back here.  Nice.  Do you, uh, and Jake, it's, it's, you, you've, I think testified that you had thrown a fight  and is that one of those things that you look back on and you regret?  Do you have feelings about that?  The fight that, uh, the mob kind of got you to throw?  Yeah.  So yes, I did, but there's nothing I could do about it. 
[02:28:00]  I had to play both, uh, one fight.  Mm-hmm.  Because you wanted the, the Marcel Sedan fight.  Yeah, but, uh, before I fought Marcel Sedan.  And he was a great fighter from Europe.  And, uh, and it happened that I met him.  Well, Jake, tell us about Laurent D'Artile.  Tell us about that fight.  Uh, uh, I thought Laurent D'Artile was 23 seconds left of the 15th round. 
[02:28:30]  I could not win the fight.  But I knocked him down.  They counted 10.  There was 23 seconds left of the fight.  I was very, very lucky to retain my title.  Hmm.  Ring Magazine called that the toughest come-from-behind fight of all time.  Well, it was amazing to watch old, I was watching footage of the Robinson fights, and it's interesting  to me, like, what was it about you that you just wouldn't go down? 
[02:29:00]  Is it because you stayed so close, or, it was amazing how you wouldn't fall?  That was my style.  I, I, I got less punches by being aggressive.  I got less punches.  The other guy was so anxious, so ready to protect themselves that they live right back.  And it was a very good idea to keep it close and keep us throwing punches and nothing backing  up.  I don't know how to back up.  He still doesn't know how to back up today. 
[02:29:30]  He doesn't know how to back up.  He really doesn't.  So that style in the ring is actually who he is.  Yeah, that was, that was, that was the great stuff to watch was this inability.  And did you, did you like fighting, uh, more as a, uh, a middleweight or, uh, you went  up to light heavyweight at one point or no?  I fought, so all I fought was light heavyweights.  The little guys didn't want to fight me.  Oh, they wouldn't fight you?  No.  So I fought the big guys, all big light heavyweights, all bigger than me. 
[02:30:00]  And they wanted me to back up, but I don't know how.  So I absorbed all the punches that they threw at me.  I swallowed the punch just so they didn't get the full power behind me.  Yeah, they said you would, you would kind of go with a punch, right?  You would kind of take it and move with it.  Yeah, I had an act that brought him with a punch because those guys I thought, I wouldn't  be around here talking to you if I didn't learn something about protecting myself. 
[02:30:30]  Right, so you were maybe a better defensive boxer than people gave you credit for.  That's right.  You're pretty smart.  Whoa, Jimmy.  You're the first person to ever say that.  Great aggressiveness is the best defense.  They don't know that.  They don't understand that.  But by being aggressive, I avoided getting less punches that way. 
[02:31:00]  Now, the injuries you took back then, I mean, were there any injuries you took that you thought  might end your career at any point?  Not enough that I could think of.  I first, all the time I was fighting, I was thinking of being the best of my ability.  The first, when you first started fighting in 1941, what was the money like? 
[02:31:30]  That was 1941.  Yeah, what was the money like in the 40s?  Not so big.  It wasn't big, right?  Yeah.  Like, what was the typical, like, early in the early fights, what was the typical purse?  $50.  And a watch.  $50.  And a watch.  And do you get jealous when you see guys now fighting these fights and making $10 million?  More power to them.  More power to them?  Well, the more they can make, the better I like it. 
[02:32:00]  Because I know how tough it is in the beginning trying to get there.  It's not that easy.  It's very, very tough to get started.  So, I had to develop a reputation and a name that nobody could knock me down.  No one could knock you down.  That kind of became the thing that attracted people to seeing you.  Right.  Do you think that, does the mob influence in boxing, which it was for a long time, do you 
[02:32:30]  think it's still there or do you think a lot of that's kind of gone away?  No, it's gone.  It is gone?  I think so.  What do you think ended it?  I don't know.  It wasn't worth it.  Was it the Kefauver Committee?  Did they have something to do with it?  That was a long time ago.  But didn't they have something to do with the decline of the mafia in the boxing industry?  Did they have something to do with it?  I'm proud of you.  Mr. LaMota, this is Senator Kefauver. 
[02:33:00]  You know, he went before the Senate subcommittee on racketeering and boxing.  So, Senator Kefauver said, Mr. LaMota, and how can you, on $5,000 a year, afford to keep  a girl at the Waldorf Astoria?  It's not easy.  She does these impersonations.  I think it was the real people.  I know what I want to ask.  Would you, the thing about not having sex before a fight, is that a myth or is that true? 
[02:33:30]  I think it is true.  But it never bothered me because I stayed away from it.  You stayed away from it?  It just bothered your wives.  Because I had to fight tough guys.  I felt all tough guys because I didn't bother nobody.  And I thought the bigger they are, the better I liked it.  I went right after them. 
[02:34:00]  Short, I was all bigger and taller than me.  And that's what happened.  Were you scared?  I don't think I was ever scared.  I developed such a habit of protecting myself in a ring that I fought everybody.  And I wasn't afraid of no one.  I fought nobody. 
[02:34:30]  I fought them all.  Would the younger contenders kind of avoid you or have to be forced to fight you?  No, they weren't forced to fight me.  I was forced to fight them.  All the guys were more experienced than I.  And I fought nobody.  I fought all the black men.  The black men liked me because I gave them opportunities to make some money. 
[02:35:00]  A lot of the fighters wouldn't fight the black fighters.  No, they wouldn't fight the black guys.  So I fought all the black guys.  Most of them were black.  Few of them were white.  Were the white guys scared of you?  I guess so.  And the black guys needed the money and nobody else would fight them.  Nobody else would fight them.  Nobody else would fight me.  So we fought each other.  And became friends with them.  And that was at a time where those friendships were kind of... 
[02:35:30]  It was tough to make a living in those days.  It was tough.  And after fighting, you opened Jake LaMotta's place in Florida.  And how long did you have that for?  Don't mention it.  Don't mention it?  No.  I mean, you could mention it.  No, I had a lot of problems.  A lot of problems, yeah.  He's not too smart anymore now, huh?  Jimmy?  You're not too smart now.  Well, you know, I have to...  Because I'm getting into the nightclub act now.  Is that when you started doing your nightclub act?  When you had your own place? 
[02:36:00]  And it would kind of bring people in to see you?  Yes, yes.  Now, were you always a funny guy?  Like, uh...  I don't know if I was always a funny guy.  But a lot of my jokes don't work so good.  But Jake, when you were young, you were mean, tough, vicious...  I was mean, tough, vicious, cruel, partial.  Then I retired from the ring and I went into show business.  Now, my greatest pleasure is making people laugh.  And if you don't laugh...  He puts up his left hand.  Oh, yeah, that would be good. 
[02:36:30]  Yes, a good fist to the mouth.  Now, do you shadow box every...  She knows the questions to ask me.  Interrupting once in a while while he's talking and I answer your question.  It's the same thing, you're doing what he's doing.  Okay.  Yeah, we're both just asking questions.  And he's right, basically.  If I'm yammering on about something, just interrupt and ask a question.  Because I'm not too sure what to ask.  Oh, okay.  Why the cowboy hat?  I like the cowboy hat.  And I developed a habit.  And people seem to like it, so I keep wearing it. 
[02:37:00]  Are you happy to be performing again and doing shows again?  Did you miss that?  Well, I never left it.  You never left it?  No, no.  Every once in a while I go back.  And is it something that, like, after you left boxing,  did you ever want to continue in the boxing world?  Or did you just want to be an entertainer?  Both.  I think you managed a boxer at one point, didn't you? 
[02:37:30]  You had a boxer, a young boxer you managed for a little while?  I managed.  And then you got into show business?  I went into show business.  Now, what else did I do?  You got married six times.  Six times.  Who's Kyle?  Six times.  That's nuts.  She was like a servant.  That's me.  She was like a servant.  And the day before we were going to get married,  I developed pneumonia. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Oof.  And it's been kept off since last year, I think.  It was this year.  It was January 4th.  We were supposed to get married.  On January 3rd, we were in Arizona,  and he came down with the shakes.  I had to bring him to the hospital he had.  They diagnosed him with pneumonia.  January 4th, he was standing in the hallway of his room  ready for me to pick him up and take him home.  Wow.  They had already discharged him.  So, but by that time,  the justice of the peace had gone home,  and we couldn't get married.  Are you married now, though, right? 
[02:38:30]  No.  Oh, you're going to be?  Eventually, one day.  First chance we get.  Well, you could probably.  I mean, we're so busy, you have to imagine.  91-year-old man, we're busy all the time.  Do you have time to do it or no?  No, we really don't.  I mean, you want to do it right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I suppose.  Move around.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask Jake.  Now, do you really want to get married again,  or did you feel it coming on and go,  oh, I got pneumonia, and just kind of blow it off?  We've been together for so long, 
[02:39:00]  for so many years.  It's a habit.  No, he's the one that wants to get married.  We're married.  All we need is a piece of paper to sign.  Yeah.  And the first chance I get,  I will sign it and marry her,  because I love her, and that's the way it is.  No, he was the one that pushed to get married.  Yeah.  Are you a jealous guy?  I don't think so.  He's very jealous.  Yeah?  Oh.  Very.  We were in Las Vegas 
[02:39:30]  at Leon Spinks' 60th birthday party  in August last month,  and we were at the Rock the Vault show  at the Las Vegas Hotel.  By the way, it's a terrific show.  Yeah.  And they had all the guys up there,  and Leon's wife wanted to get up on the stage  and dance a little bit,  so she grabbed me.  We went up on stage.  We danced a little bit.  I came down from the stage,  and everybody was rocking.  And he started lit into me like it was a real problem 
[02:40:00]  I was up there.  So he went back to his old type, you know,  from being raised in that old tradition  where I guess, you know,  the lady just doesn't do anything like that.  Did he ever belch you in the face?  Never.  God forbid.  Never.  Never.  You know, I've got to ask.  Never.  But it really upset me,  because he was verbally abusive when I said to him.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and my shoe broke,  and we were having a great time.  So when we came out,  we were going to go to the after party, 
[02:40:30]  and he didn't want to go.  I said, we're going to the after party.  And we went to the after party.  We had a great time.  And then he apologized later on,  but you have to talk to him after the fact,  because during the time, it's heated.  There's no reaching him.  He says to me, well, just, you know, tell me.  Yeah, right.  I'll tell you.  Yeah.  Honey, you're acting like that, you know,  and it just doesn't work like that.  Well, that same stubbornness,  that same kind of is the same thing  that wouldn't let you go down in the ring.  Stupidity.  I didn't want to say it like that, Jake,  but you can. 
[02:41:00]  I felt it was better to throw it out there  and see if you picked up on it.  But you, that's the same thing  that wouldn't let you fall in the ring.  It was that same plow through  and not stop mentality.  Right.  Probably you're right.  You diagnosed that pretty good.  Oh, Jimmy's smart again.  Yeah.  Back to being smart.  But that's it.  There's a stubbornness to not going down in the ring  because there's times I saw a part of that...  Too much pride.  What's that?  Too much pride.  Too much pride.  Yeah, it's the same thing. 
[02:41:30]  I watched that Nordico fight  and there was times where you're holding onto the ring.  Nordico's beating you, hitting you hard,  and it was after your slip,  and you're holding onto the ring with your right hand,  and you're punching with your left hand,  and you're holding the ring so you don't go down.  That's who he is.  Any other fighter would have fallen down,  but you're holding the ring rope.  I've never seen anybody actually physically do that.  I don't know.  Sometimes it's stupid.  He's a terrific man.  He really is.  He's got a huge heart.  He's a very nice, gentle soul. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, and your royalty.  I mean, in boxing,  the other boxers treat you very well, don't they?  Mm-hmm.  I guess so.  Oh, yeah, he's the godfather of boxing.  At this point, there's nobody older.  Yeah, is there anybody left from that era  that fought Ray Robinson  and fought all these, you know, again?  Sugar Ray Robinson is dead.  God bless us all.  You guys became friends, or you were friends?  We were friends.  We were good friends, too. 
[02:42:30]  Sugar Ray was his, um...  He had a lot of pride.  He had a lot of pride.  I had a lot of pride.  He was looking to knock me down,  and I was looking to stand up  and charge him  and throw as much first as he threw at me.  I threw at him.  And they're all close fights.  You don't fight six times unless they're close.  And these were close fights.  I said, I fought Sugar Ray so many times 
[02:43:00]  it's the ones that I don't have diabetes.  Well, you know, Sugar...  Jake, I said that joke a couple of times already.  Oh, I didn't catch it.  That's fine.  It's a good one every time, Jake.  What the hell?  You know.  But, I mean, he's 91, and he wants his...  Again, this is his idea to have this cabaret act.  It wasn't mine.  He pushed me to do it.  Well, it being...  Like, when you're a fighter,  and, you know,  there's probably a certain amount of activity you need,  and you have to always feel like you're moving forward. 
[02:43:30]  Sure.  You can't just stagnate and sit there.  How do you know?  Well, I've been told by men.  I wouldn't know.  I've just been told by...  He's a fighter on the radio.  Yeah.  Oh, no, he's absolutely right.  You should take a punch from Jake LaMotta.  LaMotta's right.  The nerve of me to talk to Jake like we're both fighters.  Exactly.  I should put on a dress and show...  That's good.  That's good.  I like it.  You like it?  No, but you are.  You guys are champs on the radio.  Oh, well.  We try.  Gosh.  Do you shadow box every day,  or do you hit the bag every day, or...? 
[02:44:00]  No, I don't.  I used to.  Now I hit her.  No, I hit her.  I would love to see him shadow box.  That would be amazing.  She hits me back.  Well, come to the show.  She hits me back.  I tell her, don't do that.  Yeah.  It's not nice.  Yeah, do you...  She's a lovely, gorgeous, beautiful lady,  and she has a great heart.  God bless her.  I love her.  Isn't that sweet? 
[02:44:30]  And now let's give the final plug.  Yes, please.  Where can you see...  Everyone wants to see Jake LaMotta live,  and in this show, this cabaret,  it's...  When is it again?  Right.  It's on Friday, September 13th,  at 7 p.m. at the Metropolitan Room  on 34 West 22nd Street in Manhattan,  and then on Sunday, the 15th,  he will be at the Orchard Beach Classic Car Show  in the Bronx.  So if you're around and you want to go see Jake,  he's the last from that era, 
[02:45:00]  and, you know, if you don't know...  Along with Larry,  his stores will be there as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be really worth it  because I'm pretty good at it.  Okay.  The cabaret show.  All right.  Good.  Thank you so much.  Thank you to the great Jake LaMotta.  Absolutely.  Thanks, Jake.  Happy to hear.  And thank you, dear.  Thank you.  What a treat.  Thank you.  This has been a lot of fun.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We're going to take a break, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do that.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:45:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The great Jake LaMotta. 
[02:46:00]  Once again, thanks for coming in.  The legend himself.  91 years old.  That was something.  It was very, very fascinating.  Wait a minute.  He's 91?  So that...  Wait, wait, wait.  So he was around, I think I'm right, before MTV?  I don't...  I'm not good with Matt.  I think he might have been around...  Yes.  I think it started later that year. 
[02:46:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Yes.  His fights, if you look at the dates of his fights and stuff,  it was like 20 fights before World War II started.  Before America's involvement in World War II.  I didn't know that they would do fights that close together.  That's crazy.  I'm amazed more guys than die.  20 fights a year in one year.  Three weeks apart.  It's just got to hurt.  Brutal.  Like, you'd still hurt.  You'd still be ringing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I don't want to get punched in the face because it still hurts from the last punching. 
[02:47:00]  Or were they tougher because they'd been punched so much that they just didn't care?  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  I've gotten over the fear of how awful this is, so I can just plow right into guys' neck.  Right.  To not go down, though.  Like, that's the amazing thing about a guy like that is to literally get punched that hard that many times and to not go down.  What a bull.  And his compensation for, well, I never really learned how to do any backup is then I'm going to need to learn to absorb punishment or I don't have a career.  That level of decision making is beyond me. 
[02:47:30]  But it's appropriate that he goes into comedy after.  That is, yeah, exactly, yeah.  What better way to fucking...  And there is, there was that moment, and it was kind of funny where you were, and you called yourself on it, but there is that thing of comedians wanting to, we are kind of like boxers.  No, you're not, but in your mind, you're like, yeah, the humiliation I go to.  Yeah, but you, you're not, you're not pissing blood after a bad set.  You're just kind of going, oh, they did not like me. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, that was, uh, God, just getting that old is...  But he's no worse than any other 91-year-old, and he was more coherent than a lot of fucking 70-year-olds.  As far as coherent goes and stuff, that's fine.  It's, you know, he's just texted one joke a few times, who cares?  But to sit there, like to watch him sitting there, it looks like, it looks like he's constantly trying to just stay alive.  Like, like, it's work to just live. 
[02:48:30]  It just looks like a lot of work.  Yeah.  Well, there's also got to be that thing where all great athletes learn to stop listening to your body and have the mind tell the body what it's going to do.  Because the body will always tell you, like, hey, we should stop, I'm tired.  The mind's like, here's what we're going to do.  So it's a mind, like the body is, his body is constantly going, hey, let's just die now.  Like, we're ready, and the mind's like, no, we've got to do a show on the 13th, so we're not going to die yet.  We have things to do.  And she knows we're all looking at her, like, are you behind this, where he's still performing, and she wanted to make it perfectly clear it's him. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, she jumped out pretty quick and was like, the funniest thing I saw during that entire interview, she sits down, she goes to cross her legs, I see Jim look right up her fucking skirt.  I looked right at your eyes, you fucking, and she was talking to you at the time.  You were looking at her eyes, both of you.  And Jimmy just goes right down to her fucking position.  Oh, I wish Jake had caught that.  You looking at my wife?  Yeah.  You looking at my wife?  Did you see a punched out eye? 
[02:49:30]  No.  Oh, God.  A little leg.  She was sexy for an older bro.  How old do you think?  I'm going to guess in her 50s.  50s.  She's got to be older than that.  No.  Really?  60s easy.  I would think she's older than that.  I'd say late 50s.  Late 50s?  Late 50s.  What?  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hard to say.  I got to go mid-60s.  I saw a little nipple placement when she took her thing off, and they weren't down as  low as I thought they'd be.  That wasn't bad.  I got to be honest.  Are you a weatherman?  The nipples are not as low as we thought. 
[02:50:00]  We were predicting something a little lower, but...  His hands look like they're in the shape of boxing gloves now.  Like, the thumbs are at this weird lower level.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  Like, it's the years of...  They have this weird shape to them now.  It's amazing.  I was looking at his hands, too, and from the movie, where he's like, my hands are too  small.  Little girl's hands.  A little girl.  He does have little hands.  Very small hands.  Yeah.  We've had boxes.  Never going to fight Joe Louis.  Yeah.  We've had boxes in here that just fucking shake hands with them.  Ridiculous.  Giant fucking monster hands.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and his were like, they were kind of little hands. 
[02:50:30]  We have a lot of boxers on the show.  Yeah, a lot of them.  And Jimmy's an expert at that shit, so...  No, I know.  I don't know.  We almost had Sugar Ray Leonard cry on our show.  That was amazing.  Yeah, he started getting into some shit that happened to him.  About his molesting.  Some molestation, and he...  Did you show him the Dudley episode?  Yeah, get over it.  It looked like he went a little further with us than he has in the past, and he was really  close to breaking down.  But then one of my co-workers got a little uncomfortable.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  Oh my God, Anthony couldn't handle this. 
[02:51:00]  He bailed him out.  He's out, oh, it's okay.  You're here now.  Me and Jimmy are wide-eyed like...  How's the career going, Slugger?  Yeah.  We're wide-eyed like, oh my God, Sugar Ray Leonard's going to cry at any moment.  And Ant was feeling that and made sure he snapped him out of it.  Pulled the ripcord.  Yes.  He didn't want to be here to see Sugar Ray Leonard cry.  I asked him one, too, that I wanted to get him.  I used the word betrayed.  Yep.  That was it.  It was close.  Oh, yeah.  Do you feel betrayed?  We've had Tyson twice, three times.  Do you feel betrayed?  I don't know.  He did write about being molested, so I had to ask. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, okay.  Then we had Tyson, a bunch.  He's unbelievable.  Then we had Joe Frazier near the end there.  No kidding.  He was amazing.  Was he coherent?  Still fucking taking shots at Ali.  Yeah.  He didn't let it go, man.  He didn't let that grudge go.  I think he was playing his answer machine for us where there's a message that trashes Ali.  He just, right to the end, man.  Yeah, he's like, you see the way he is?  I'm responsible for this.  Joe was not happy with Ali's taunting and calling him an Uncle Tom.  And he sang.  You got Joe Frazier singing for Patton Oswald. 
[02:52:00]  Isn't that amazing how many boxers Jake has outlived?  Dude.  Everyone.  Amazing.  Oh, did I tell you?  I met Arsenio when I did Leno.  He was doing something, like shooting something for later.  Is he still coherent?  Like how coherent is he?  He looked really fucking skinny.  But I asked him about the Ali interview.  And I talked to him about how I think he got the real last Ali interview.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Do you remember when Ali was on his show?  And again, he was like, you know, he could hardly talk.  And then Mike Tyson, who was the champ, came on. 
[02:52:30]  And Sugar Ray Leonard.  And it was a really cool, like, moment.  I don't remember that.  That's amazing.  I didn't know they were almost great.  And Ali admitted that he was scared of Tyson.  And I said to Arsenio, I think you got the first publicly humble moment out of Tyson.  Like, everyone saw him as just this beast.  And then, you know, with you, he completely gave way to Ali and completely conceded.  And it's like, no one had seen Tyson talk like that about anybody.  It was really nice.  Yeah.  It was nice.  That's amazing.  We got a clip of Joe Frazier just for Patton Oswald. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, let's hear him.  Who decided to hang out with us.  And we're very happy about that.  Who's Russell Peters, by the way?  He's not here.  Thank you.  I know that.  He was going to try to get up early.  I don't know.  Maybe he wasn't in the car.  I like that Sam Stakes, the obvious.  Where's Russell Peters?  Well, he's not doing 20 minutes on the console.  Thanks, Sam.  Fucking narrows it down.  He's not in the building.  Here's Joe Frazier.  Here he goes.  Mustang Sally.  I don't know that one either.  That's the old one.  Think you better slow your Mustang down.  That's what I'm trying to tell you now. 
[02:53:30]  Mustang Sally now, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Think you better slow your Mustang down.  You've been running all over town.  Just have to put your white feet on the ground.  All you want to do is ride on the ground.  How is boxing legal?  How is fucking boxing legal at this point?  Can we just say it is one of the most detrimental things? 
[02:54:00]  Why are we stuck talking old fighters?  It's creepy.  Oh, my God.  Someone's got to say it.  They just call boxing almost murder.  You want to go watch the almost murder match tonight?  Yes, yes.  We're trying to be cool about this.  It's creepy.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Did we talk over the booze at the end of the Joe Frazier singing?  Wait, was that what happened there?  Could you replay the end of that?  This is what happened at the end of this legend singing.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  All you want to do is ride around Sally. 
[02:54:30]  Ride, Sally.  Ride.  Holy shit, that was mean.  What?  Wait a minute.  I don't have that booze.  I'm still dealing with the cake thing.  Leave me alone in a while.  Homer Simpson's booing.  Oh, it's so awful.  Yeah, but it's got to be said.  It just creeps us out.  Why do we have to interview these guys?  They all just.  I mean, his brain being rattled around and he had some age to it. 
[02:55:00]  I wonder if it's like, if there's an element of like, like, like out of shape guys, well,  like me, there's an element of pleasure of like, well, no, I don't fight like that, but  I'm still coherent.  At least I could fucking put together a sentence.  So that makes us feel better about our lives.  You know what?  Maybe, yeah.  It leads to a video I was telling these guys about that we should see for a couple seconds.  They went super slow-mo on some UFC highlights.  Oh, yeah.  I want to see that.  I think if you go to E-Bomb's World, I saw it there.  I couldn't sit through the whole video. 
[02:55:30]  It was so fucking creepy what happens to the head when you're taking a fucking punch.  Can I see Sam?  I can't see.  Is this E-Bomb's World?  E-Bomb's World ran this amazing clip a few days ago of a guy in a poker game, one of  those, and he goads the other guy into betting, and then he ends up, and he loses like a $900,000  pot, and he could have won if he just shut his mouth, and the guy had just folded, and  he made it, and the look on this guy's face is at, like, you can watch a soul die. 
[02:56:00]  Wow.  You watch a soul actually die.  Wow.  Yeah, let's go down.  It's on the front page still somewhere.  A little further down, further down.  Yeah.  Scrolling, scrolling.  Scrolling, sorry.  Right there.  Oh, dear.  I couldn't sit through this whole fucking thing.  I know it's a visual.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page.  Probably turn that volume down.  That's really annoying.  But those, you know, those super slow-mo cameras that people are doing a lot of cool  things with now.  Oh, ow.  That's not good.  Just the way the...  Watch the head shot. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, his whole head is like a skull.  Oh, wow.  This is what...  His head bent.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The whole skull bends.  Oh, God.  It looks like all the skin's gonna fly off his skull.  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Yikes.  See, that can't be...  Oh!  His other ear on the other side of his head move. 
[02:57:00]  Rattles.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everything rattles.  Ow.  God.  That one looked like his whole fucking hair was gonna come off.  Oh!  Oh!  It looked like his whole...  Did you see that?  It looked like his whole face flattened.  Yeah.  Well, you know...  Wow.  Oh, yikes.  Good night.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, we just...  Oh, they missed.  Yeah, they have both their arms locked.  Yeah.  But even when you see the damage it does to the torso, you see, like, everything gets... 
[02:57:30]  Oh, dear.  You kick, there's a...  Oh, he misses.  Oh, he misses the kick.  Oh, he kicked.  Yeah.  There's a fucking spinning back fist to the side of the head.  Yeah, I mean, it's...  But the scene in slow-mo, it's unbelievable.  God knows what's happening to your brain and to your insides.  Yes.  Like, your organs.  I wonder if these guys have, like, problems with, like, bowel movements and urinating.  That's gotta mess you up.  I hope so, because I do, and I've never been pissed. 
[02:58:00]  Isn't that unbelievable?  They must have to, like, suck those morphine lollipops they give those guys just to, like,  just to get through your day.  When you look at the way they're...  You think, you know, your skull is pretty solid and stuff, but their whole...  Their whole head bends when you get punched in the side of the head.  Everything just gets completely distorted for a split second.  Oh, where's that going?  Wow, that's a hell of a move right there.  That was from recently, I think.  That was ridiculous.  Yeah, that was the Benson Henderson fan.  You just lost that. 
[02:58:30]  But anyway, that'll be up on our Facebook page.  That was tough to watch.  You know, it's the same with football.  I was reading...  I always get the Best American Sports Writing compilation every year.  So there was this article in one a few years ago about this old football player who is  in so much chronic pain that he has to...  He uses a taser at night.  He has to tase himself to sleep.  He's in that much pain.  So he tases himself until he's totally numb, and then he can fall asleep.  Is it a guy we know from the past? 
[02:59:00]  It's this guy...  It was an article in one of the Best American Sports Writing, like, 2009.  And it was so brutal with this, like...  I mean, you think about, like, they're improving the helmets now, so that...  But think of the guys that are still alive from these 70s and 80s and what they did to  themselves.  I don't know what they're going to do with football.  I think football's in trouble.  These guys are getting too quick, too fucking strong.  Yeah.  I don't know how they're going to keep that sport going.  I think there's got to be a point of no return with steroids where you build your muscles  to the point where your skeleton can't support what you're doing. 
[02:59:30]  Like, forget even you hitting somebody.  You are lifting weights and running in ways that your skeleton can't...  Yeah, yeah.  It's not meant to do that.  You need some kind of skeleton steroids to build that up.  Yeah, it's like you're tearing yourself apart.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe if they could add adamantium to their bones like in the Wolverine comics.  That would be an interesting thing.  They could add all of that.  I don't think that would actually improve football, I think.  That would be great. 
[03:00:00]  Let's debate the pros and cons of that.  At our next seminar.  Yeah.  The next TED Talk.  There's your next TED Talk.  That's your TED Talk, yeah.  Ex-Begg technology is for you for improving American team sports.  Oh, is this the poker guy?  Wait, the saddest face in poker.  Oh, God, look at this guy.  All right, so what do we do?  Go back to the beginning here.  Let me show you what's happening in this thing.  He has...  Okay, so this guy has Ace 10.  The other guy has Ace, Queen.  The flop, there's a 10. 
[03:00:30]  So he's got two pair.  All he's got to do is shut up and let the guy fold.  Ace 10.  He's got a 93% chance of winning.  All he's got to do is just be quiet.  All he's got to do is get it.  Two poker pros here.  Gil dropped out of Cal State Chico.  Watch this.  Ferretti's graduated from Harvard.  Gil born in Madras, Oregon.  I can't even find that out.  So Gil is...  All right.  The guy could just drop out. 
[03:01:00]  Right, right.  But he's not an Ace, Queen?  He's got Ace, Queen.  And there's only one card left.  Ace 10 went all in.  Look at that.  He's turning a fucking Queen on the river.  Ha ha.  Oh my God.  He's going to turn a Queen on the river.  Oh, he's going to fuck this guy.  $987,000 pot.  Oh, there it is.  Oh my God.  Oh, look at his face.  He's done.  He knows it.  His soul is dead.  He just died.  He's done. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, wow.  He just goes, wow.  Oh, wow.  And goodbye.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  He's out.  You did a good job, man.  You did a good job, man.  Bye.  Goodbye.  I'm never recovering from that.  He's lost.  Basically a million dollars because I didn't shut up.  Wait, so how did he talk his way out of that guy folding?  Because he kept going like, I mean, because the guy's thinking maybe I should fold. 
[03:02:00]  He goes, oh, really?  Because, I mean, you got, who knows?  I mean, there could be enough there.  He thought he had.  He just was, he just wanted him to bet against he could get even more money.  Yes, he wanted more money.  He got greedy.  Yeah.  And was like, come on.  He got greedy.  Hey, you could get it.  Come on, man.  Yeah.  He was like, all right.  I'll call.  And then he was so excited to then turn his cards and go, oh, two pair.  Oh, my gosh.  I guess you got to get a Queen.  Because you got to get a Queen.  And then the guy gets it.  Oh, my God.  It's the only card that he had to win with was a Queen.  It's just, and his face, like. 
[03:02:30]  The way his face looks like, no, that didn't just happen.  Yeah.  That did not just come out.  It is.  It's, you literally watch a guy who has life in his eyes.  And then.  Yes.  The light, gone.  It was gone.  His eyes just dead.  Like the Terminator.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I know why you cry, but it is something I could never do.  Yes.  No, that sounds more like Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, I was in, I remember I was in college and I took some class about death and dying  in philosophy or something.  And, and, and we, it was, it was a one o'clock class in the afternoon. 
[03:03:00]  And for some reason, I, me and my friends drank that morning, like starting at 10 a.m.  So I showed up to class drunk and we were talking about Socrates and the professor was  going now, did what Socrates do?  Was it a suicide?  And I had seen Terminator two the night before.  So then I'm, I'm kind of buzzing.  I'm like, Hey, you know, I saw in Terminator two, uh, speaking of Socrates.  So at the end, he says, I can't self terminate, but then he lets the kid lower him into the 
[03:03:30]  steel, the molten steel.  So if he passively accepts his death, technically does, isn't that self termination?  And so the, the professor starts going, well, that's an, and then one of the other kids  in the class said, we are not talking about Terminator two.  And I went, no, but cause he says, and then this kid goes, we are not talking about Terminator.  You fucking drunk.  So that was my, that's my best memory of college is I was trying to fold Terminator two 
[03:04:00]  into his death.  Were you a Pink Floyd guy, Patton?  Yeah.  When I was younger.  All right.  Good.  Classic.  I mean, Dark Side of the Moon is.  Yeah.  Well, Iraq hates Pink Floyd.  Iraq doesn't really like it.  And he doesn't hate much on this show.  It's really hard to get an opinion from the guy.  And, uh, he was all in on the Pink Floyd today for some reason.  What?  Yeah.  He was a little.  Iraq, would you want to?  Pink Floyd.  He just doesn't like it.  Let's hear it.  See, you can't even get an opinion out of him now. 
[03:04:30]  I know.  Now he's going to back off.  What is he shutting down?  What's wrong?  That's what he does.  He hates Pink Floyd.  Why?  Cause in school his, uh, roommates were like all fucking Pink Floyd and smoking weed.  And he'd come home and be like, oh, here we go again.  He would hear, is there anybody in there?  He said he would get home and they would play what he referred to as the cash register song.  Yeah, yeah, he calls it the cash register song.  A classic.  That's like the way my grandmother would talk about Pink Floyd.  Well, they've got that wonderful cash register song where they, it's clever because they, 
[03:05:00]  you know, a lot of things in life can make music.  And you can take a toaster and maybe there's a song and a toaster in there.  Well, they're British, so they can figure that out.  Of course they can do that.  Cash register song.  Hey, Iraq.  Yeah, he doesn't.  Yeah, well.  I'm not a huge fan.  It's, it's moody music, you know.  Yeah, but there's something about that album, Dark Side of the Moon.  They just, it's amazing.  Like they caught a specific feeling at a certain time when just, it just feels like they record 
[03:05:30]  a time when the country was just sick and angry and everyone was in an awful mood and  they just captured that forever.  It really is kind of a time capsule thing, that album.  Yeah, yeah.  Like we're in a bad mood right now.  You look at albums like that and then you just look at some cheesy pop album and realize,  wow, technically they're the same thing.  Right.  But one like has so much behind it and means so much.  And the other thing is just fucking nothingness.  But, and they end up selling more. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's also amazing that if you hear those voices in the background, those were, they  would write all these questions on cards, like what does death mean or like all these  really heavy questions.  And then they brought people in and they were going to like hide them like in the mix, like  they're answering these weird questions.  So they brought in like Paul and Linda McCartney and, and that's Paul going, I can't think of  anything to say.  Like he has not, he just couldn't think of anything.  Really?  And then all the heavy shit came from the guy who was like the janitor at the studio. 
[03:06:30]  He's the guy who says, yeah.  So if you listen to like the end of Dark Side of the Moon, he goes, there's, there's no  dark side of the moon.  Really?  Matter of fact, it's old doc.  Like that's the janitor is doing all this heavy duty.  And then Paul's just, I don't know what to say.  I'm not afraid of dying.  I mean, you know, you got to go sometime.  Just all these really, and they ended up using his voice throughout the whole album.  What an interesting thing to do.  Just a dude at the studio. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  And saying all this, and he's the one kind of doing some really evil shit about, you  give him this short, sharp, shock.  They don't do it again.  Dig it.  Like he's just talking about basically torturing people and all this shit.  And none of that was written for him?  No.  Did you know?  I mean, it was, all it was was cards.  They would ask, they would ask me questions, let them go off.  And he would just, they realized they just had this crazy old British dude that would  just say all this deep shit.  I had to learn something today.  I didn't know that.  So he, yeah, he's immortal. 
[03:07:30]  Whenever they do that stuff in concert, they play the clip of him going, there's no dark side  of the moon.  It's all dark.  Like, whoa, okay.  They'd probably structure that whole album around this fucking curmudgeon.  He'd probably say something.  It's supposed to be a fun pop album.  They'd probably get it every morning and go, hey, good morning.  Well, it is if you don't have cancer.  And they're like, we should use him for something.  This guy's cool.  And you know that he was at the pub that night after work going, these fucking hippies come 
[03:08:00]  in, all I want to do is empty the bins and they got me, I've got to answer these fucking  questions and I don't, you know, I don't know.  I'm going to fucking quit.  Or they got to give me more money if I'm going to talk to these fucking, you know, wankers.  I bet you he didn't even get money for that.  They probably, they wanted me to sign papers.  I said, get me a fucking punch of wankers and I'll do it for that.  You think he made a horrible deal?  Yeah, got caught in this fucking stupid album that no one's going to listen to.  Fuck that.  He's legendary.  He didn't get anything out of it in the end. 
[03:08:30]  Well, that was the classic James Earl Jones when he went and did Star Wars and he did  all the Darth voice, Darth Vader voice in a day because he was like the voiceover guy  and Lucas or the studio said, we can give you like nine grand, which was unheard of for  voiceover in the 70s, or you can have half a point of this movie.  And he went, you can give me the nine grand.  And I was like, I know what you're trying to do.  That point probably would have been, he would have wound up with fucking 30 or 40 grand  if he had just done that.  Well, if he's lucky, sure. 
[03:09:00]  Wow, Jim, you're really not good with numbers, are you?  You think he regrets that?  Oh, he, he, I heard an interview where he goes, if I had said yes, you'd be talking to  me on the James Earl Jones network right now.  Wow.  But how about the second one?  Oh, he probably just got a salary for it.  Well, no, I think actually to Lucas's credit, he gave them all like some little bonus, like  when they came back to the second one.  So they're all, they're all doing okay.  But always remember that Lucas waived his director's fee and said, just give me all the merchandising.  That's what I want.  And we're going to be like, yeah, enjoy it, asshole. 
[03:09:30]  We're going to want to buy these little fucking action figures.  It's worth $5 billion.  Yeah.  So, oh man.  Because back then, merchandising didn't make money.  It was just for suckers.  It's like David Cho for Facebook.  They couldn't really afford him.  So he said, all right.  And he got a piece of Facebook.  It was over $200 million.  Yeah.  That sounds like the deal I made here.  Oh, yeah.  I said, I'd like this amount.  And they said, we're going to give you this.  And I went, all right.  I took it.  And I sucked all their cocks.  And Cho is spending that money in the coolest, like he's doing the craziest shit with his money. 
[03:10:00]  Like that's the way when you make, he is the example of when you make a crazy amount of money, the exact way to spend it.  Just doing insane stunts, crazy shit.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  What's he doing?  He's away now, but I know he's back.  I like him.  Bizarre, weird shit.  He's just, I mean, get him on the show and look, ask him.  Like what he does, like in a week.  Trust me, it'll be something insane. 
[03:10:30]  And he's spending his money and doing just, because he wants to have, he's using his money for experiences rather than for objects.  Things, right.  And things.  I just want to, I'm going to spend it on having experiences.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a good artist too.  I mean, he's a really good artist.  Oh, he's brilliant.  I mean, he's just amazing at what he does.  Amazing shit.  It's not like he contributes nothing.  I mean, the guy is fucking great.  And he literally, there's a really cool documentary about him where he did start as a tagger.  And I mean like tagging, he would see a building.  He would do this whale everywhere because he would go, I would look at these ugly industrial buildings. 
[03:11:00]  I'm like, I'm going to do a pretty whale on it.  And he found a way he could do it like as he was walking so he wouldn't get caught.  Like he was one of the early guys that invented the, okay, here's how you can tag like in broad daylight and no one realizes you're doing it until it's too late.  Uh-huh.  And then that led to becoming this huge artist.  Fucking 200 million.  I'm going to watch that documentary.  Yeah.  200 million.  Check it out.  200 million.  Yeah.  Like it was painting the walls or something.  Some kind of little mural thing, right?  It's a deal that they probably wish they hadn't made.  Right.  I bet. 
[03:11:30]  I bet.  Look at that side of it.  We could have hung pictures.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Look at that side of it.  It's Mansell Adams.  A Beverly Hills Cop 3 poster framed it, put it up.  Exactly.  I would have drawn something.  We talked to somebody else on the show that turned down points on a movie.  It's a crazy deal.  Yeah.  And took a lump sum.  Lump sum.  What the fuck was it?  It was recently.  Always take points.  Even if it flops initially, you never know.  I mean, think of people that probably got laughed at for taking points on something like Office Space or Donnie Darko or The Big Lebowski. 
[03:12:00]  Right.  And then 10 years down the road.  I mean, the guy, Lou, one of the reasons Lou Adler is a billionaire and has courtside seats with Jack Nicholson at the Lakers is because he held on to his points for the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Jesus.  And then just waited and now it's ka-ching for doing nothing.  No shit.  I pitched on – I was one of the people that pitched a Rocky – he wanted to do a sequel to Rocky Horror Picture, so they brought me in to pitch my idea for the movie. 
[03:12:30]  And I went to his house in Malibu.  So it is up on this cliff side.  It is the most gorgeous house I've ever seen.  And that grandfather clock with the skeleton inside of it from Rocky Horror Picture is right by the front door.  Wow, cool.  That you walk by it and then you go sit and then you – and he just lives in this palace.  And I talked to him for half an hour like, here's what I would do with the movie.  And he's like, nah, I'm not going to – but it's nice to meet you.  Like, he was perfectly nice, but, you know, the studio wanted to try to do a sequel and he's, all right, I'll listen to people.  And he just sat there having his bagel and enjoying himself. 
[03:13:00]  Just a happy old rich hippie.  By the way, the guy was Donald Sutherland and it was Animal House.  Oh, right.  Oh, dude.  Yeah.  That's rude.  Donald Sutherland took a paycheck instead of a piece of Animal House.  And he showed his ass in that movie and didn't –  Yes, he absolutely did.  His old Donald Sutherland ass.  Yeah, that was a funny scene.  Oh, here it is.  And he got paid nothing.  I forgot what he told us at the time.  It was nothing.  It was nothing.  Well, you know, the guy that plays Hoover in that is – Jamie Widows is a huge TV director now. 
[03:13:30]  He does –  Has he really?  Yeah.  And he's like – and I work with – he did King of Queens a lot.  Oh, wow.  And he's like one of the nicest – he is just so ridiculously nice and has amazing Animal House stories about getting to work on that film and how they would divide up all the actors into the omegas and the deltas.  And then they kind of started taking on –  Oh, shit.  Like they started to sort of hate each other and they wouldn't like hang out with each other and they would kind of fight.  And he goes, there was a guy on the set and his only job was when they called at the end of shooting every day was to hustle Belushi into a car and get him up to this house he was staying in because they didn't want him to stay on the set and party with people because he would drink everyone into the earth basically. 
[03:14:00]  So they had to get him out of there as quick as they could.  Wow.  Yeah.  And that was the guy's job is to get Belushi in the car and drive him away.  Wow.  Yeah.  I have to leave you guys.  You guys keep chatting.  I have to go.  I have to go to the airport before noon.  No, I got to get myself.  Where are you flying to today?  Chicago.  Chicago.  Doing a grand opening of a strip club. 
[03:14:30]  No kidding.  Wow.  Yeah, good money.  How long are you in Chicago for?  Tomorrow morning.  I come home at 5 o'clock.  Oh.  Why?  There's a restaurant.  If you ever go to Chicago, if you have time, go to a restaurant called Schwa.  It is the most – this guy is the best chef in the city.  Schwa.  And even all the top chefs in Chicago are like, this is the best guy.  He cranks death metal and gangster rap.  There's no menu.  You just go in there.  It's this beautiful 22-seat white linen French restaurant where they are cranking metal. 
[03:15:00]  And he looks like Rasputin.  And he – it's whatever he's bought that day.  He cooks it and brings out the most insane shit.  Schwa?  Schwa.  I ate at Fung.  I wasn't impressed.  I eat at Fung.  I eat at Fung.  Let me give out this number.  2-1-5-3-4-5-Joke if you want to come October 11 and 12.  I'm working on material at the Comedy Cabaret in Doylestown.

It takes me a half hour to get down to the cellar anyways.  Walk in.  If I take the train, I got to walk over here, do this.  Boom, skank, bing. 
[03:21:30]  So you just drive in your hours anyway.  I'm going to do like, uh, Ardsley.  Yeah.  Uh, maybe, uh, maybe an up as far as Yorktown Heights.  Yeah.  But the thing is you got to get a, I got to get a mortgage broker.  Sure.  Because I have to, uh, get, I have to get, I have to get pre-qualified, I believe they  call it.  This is all grownup stuff.  I need to know this now that I'm 30.  All right.  This is what you're going to do.  When you get, when you go for it, you got to get pre, uh, quality, you got to, what's  it called?  Uh, yeah.  Pre-fied or some shit.  Where you're going, okay, I'm going to get, I'm pre-qualified for $500,000. 
[03:22:00]  Hey.  Okay.  That sounds pretty sweet.  No, I'm not.  I'm just giving you a number.  Oh.  Mine's way harder than that.  Oh, that's dope.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying for you, probably more like 10 grand, probably you 350, 350.  Yeah.  With your paycheck stub.  Yeah.  If you brought that in.  Here's my pay stub.  Um, yeah, you got to get, you got to get qualified and then you can go in that one.  You can go buy a house.  Cause when you, now when you go buy a house, things are coming back up.  So you'll see a house you like, and there'll be nine people already bidding on it.  So you gotta, you gotta have the money to say, okay, I'm going, this house is 350. 
[03:22:30]  I will pay three.  I'll pay three 80.  That's it.  So Obama's bringing this shit back.  It's getting back, dude.  The rates are going up.  Now I got to, and it's hard too, because I'm a comic.  So all my money goes into my not you account, which is my business name.  Oh, really?  I don't know if you heard that story, but it's a, I'll tell you someday.  It's a hoot.  Save it, Bobby.  We got enough going right here.  Happy birthday to you.  You know where you could move. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  You want a rich area?  What were you going to say about Sal?  I saw him catch your eye.  What were you going to say about Sal?  I said, you know where you can move?  A rich area sales asshole?  I heard it.  I heard it's high rent.  He didn't flirty with Sal.  I lived in Westchester too.  That's right.  Where'd you live?  Four years.  I lived, well, I was in Purchase because I went to school there.  Would you live with an old man on his farm?  Did you help him do stuff and write poetry?  You were a houseboy when you were in Westchester, correct? 
[03:23:30]  Sal's a houseboy.  Yeah.  Houseboy Sal.  He was.  He was warming toilet seats and just wiping people down and whatever they needed.  He would, he worked for a couple of artists, gay men.  Yeah.  He would pose for them.  He'd do 10 minute poses.  Sal, come upstairs.  I need my release.  Every once in a while you hear beep.  Okay, switch, Sal.  Give us a new pose.  Hey, can you give, come on.  Then for lunch, you'd come up with like apple slices and pudding.  And things.  They just have a room for nude Bikram yoga that they make him do every day. 
[03:24:00]  At night, he'd have to tuck them in and clean their assholes because they'd always shit themselves.  Of course they would.  And he'd calm them down.  They'd start to cry.  I just, I get embarrassed doing it.  It's okay.  I, it's, this is human life.  This is what it, what humans do.  We sometimes, this happens.  I still care about you.  You're in the winter of your life and that's still a season.  I just need that account number.  I need to check that balance again to make sure this is all worth it.  I need to send the house boy out to get groceries. 
[03:24:30]  You know the routing number.  All right, here's the scenario.  Here's the scenario.  Are you ready, Sam?  What's the scenario?  All right, you're up and, up, up an hour and a half up.  We're talking above Yorktown Heights.  Whoa.  There's a, there's a.  You're talking about, you're talking about inching towards the Hudson Valley now.  Hudson Valley.  Yeah.  We're talking about woodsy.  We're talking about, you can get a, a nice, uh, mid-century contemporary for three  fifty.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, we're talking about four bedroom, three fifty, an acre and a half of land.  Hey.  Maybe a built-in.  Hey.  With a fence, a deer fence so you don't get those ticks on your kids. 
[03:25:00]  Right.  Happy birthday.  Okay, okay.  Okay, anyway.  Anyway.  Anyway.  Bob and Sam are back.  Motherfucker.  Put that as a ringtone.  You should isolate that.  I got a text.  Yes.  While we were talking.  Yes.  From?  Justin Stengel from the David Letterman show.  Uh, the guy, I like him.  First thing he said, but.  Yes.  But I don't think they like me over there.  Well, Justin Stengel probably likes you, but they, they still can't get you on.  I mean, he doesn't have that much pull. 
[03:25:30]  Uh, his father is, was he, his father's a doctor, right?  I think so.  That sounds about right.  Very Jewish.  I was on Cowhead.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stengel's.  Fucking one of my favorites.  Yeah.  Down in, uh, Tampa.  Yeah.  He's a big, he's a big deal down in Tampa.  I know Cowhead.  He's very funny.  I know.  I understand.  The voice is not, but Cowhead is.  Motherfucker.  It's my southern voice.  I like to eat.  I like to talk like this when I eat bananas.  Tell me about Cowhead.  Okay.  Cowhead.  Not in that voice.  Okay.  So. 
[03:26:00]  Okay.  So we, uh, yeah.  His father actually helped me with, uh, uh, I couldn't get my wife pregnant and I was  panicking and he told me all the stuff to do.  He was like, you gotta stick it in.  Well, no, I knew that.  I wasn't shooting it at her belly button.  I didn't know.  And then mixing it like fucking cookie dough.  You're like, we've had sex every night this week.  I keep pulling out and she's not getting pregnant.  That's how Sal gets people pregnant.  He comes in old guy's belly buttons and then drinks it.  It's not working.  I don't understand.  It's not working.  Why am I not pregnant? 
[03:26:30]  Why?  And then Justin's saying, yes, that his dad did help you.  He did.  The main, the best advice.  You got to just relax and not be stressed out about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because let the balls do the work, right?  That's what they always say.  That's not, that's not, no, my balls did no work.  Oh, no, but yeah, relax.  And that's it.  And then you, you know, her dead mother helped her too.  Is that right?  I told you that story, didn't I?  I told you that story.  The, the night.  Was that the same day you told me about, uh, what did we name your first baby?  Uh, oh, uh, that's, uh, uh, Toiletto Flush. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, Toiletto Flush.  Toiletto Flush.  Hey, what happened to our kid?  Uh, he's in the toilet.  Did you?  She says, Sal.  What is that, the tasteless alarm?  What is that, the too far alarm?  Yeah, okay.  Okay, let's roll it back.  Happy birthday.  Justin Stengel lives in Armonk, New York.  This is in Westchester.  How far is that?  Uh, it's in Westchester, you know, it's a, it's not that far away from Arsley.  Sal, bring it up!  And it's very, uh, affluent town.  How come our show doesn't have a lot of people? 
[03:27:30]  Bring it up!  No, but it's fucking nice.  When I say that, I want fucking things happening.  Armonk is a very affluent town.  Affluent.  Affluent.  When you mean, that means the basketball courts are not used.  No, no, yeah.  The, the basketball courts are spotless.  You have, you have nice little baseball fields.  Yeah, yeah.  You have sandlots still.  Tennis courts.  Mm-hmm.  And shuffleboard.  Lots of shuffleboard.  Let me take some of these phone calls.  Oh, we have phone calls.  Yeah, lots of them.  You know why?  You know why?  Bob and Sam show.  Oh, Lady Trucker.  Happy birthday to you. 
[03:28:00]  Happy birthday to you.  Little Lady Trucker of her moment.  Happy birthday, dear Sammy.  Happy birthday to you.  Oh, thank you very much, Lady Trucker.  It'll be great at the end of the day that you heard, fucking thing jackknifed.  And Eric's in my ear going, hang up on her.  Don't, I like Lady Trucker.  Come on, Eric.  That was very nice of her.  Plus, I got DeRosa with a hang up yesterday.  I can't be doing this every day.  Did you?  Yeah.  Why?  He was on the phone with Eliza Schlesinger. 
[03:28:30]  You know, Eliza.  And, uh, and, uh, they were talking about how much they like each other.  And so I was like, I'm here to talk to Eliza.  Goodbye, Joe.  So, you know, I can't be, I can't be having this love fest going on all day.  That sucks when you get hung up by the nicest guy on the O&A show.  Literally the nicest.  And he's like, all right, I'm done.  Yeah, I'm done.  I mean, normally I wouldn't do this, buddy.  I love you all.  But, you know, uh, Snowy in Michigan.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I like his. 
[03:29:00]  He literally took the whole song and jammed it into just one word.  Yeah.  Happy birthday.  By the way, I hope Travis is back in the office listening to Bob Kelly just described me as  the nicest guy on O&A.  Eat a dick, Travis.  Uh, Struff in Boston.  I'm eating a banana.  Oh, my gosh.  I can't believe you took Lady Trucker's call before mine.  You made it to line three.  She called in first.  Well, it's not my fault the stupid serious phone app is like 18 minutes behind schedule.  You got the first tweet back from me today. 
[03:29:30]  Wow.  You're really ruining Sam's birthday, making it about you.  Thank you, Bobby.  Okay.  When you call into the Bob and Sam show on Sam's birthday, you make it about Sam.  So sing the song or get off the line.  And I want it original.  I don't want what I did, a Lady Trucker, or the last guy did.  I want original Michigan.  Is he from Michigan?  No, Struff.  Struff.  Uh, no, well, I got nothing.  Da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!  Spit it out, boy!  Okay, Struff, I appreciate you calling in. 
[03:30:00]  Struff was my first fan of mine.  He used to call in when Thannon made it the show.  Now he's a fan of the Bob and Sam show.  That's where this thing has evolved, hasn't it?  Yeah.  Mike in Connecticut.  Don't we call, we call them fanny acts.  I don't think so.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Mike.  You need to get out of Westchester.  Come up to Fairfield County.  That's where all the white women are at.  I'm not going to, first of all, I have one white woman and that's plenty.  Where's Fairfield County?  It's in Connecticut.  Oh yeah, that's good.  Let's move there.  Let's move there and just end our careers. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Why don't we just fucking get a small shop and sell t-shirts we make with ideas on it.  We're like our fanny acts.  That's what we call the Bob and Sam fanny acts.  Except nobody's going to be fanny acts of people who lived in Fairfield County, because  who's going to hear us?  Actually, Fairfield County is really nice.  I've looked in there.  It's very nice.  No, I know.  It's nice.  You can get like a fucking 19 bedroom for $180,000 with four built-in pools and it comes  with a car.  But we have to at some point realize that we do have to come in. 
[03:31:00]  And a cotton candy machine in the basement because it's furnished.  What's wrong with you?  We have a cotton candy machine.  Seriously, that's what the governor of fucking Connecticut made, that a law.  I had no idea.  All houses come with cotton candy machines.  What about the non-furnished ones?  All houses.  All houses.  It's really driven a stake right through the real estate market because all these real  estate agents are like, I'm spending all my commission on cotton candy machines.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  You know, it still kills me. 
[03:31:30]  Do you know how much they take the real estate guys, brokers take from you?  No.  Oh God, I got to get a real estate broker.  For now, when I buy a house, I got to get another one up there that does Westchester.  I have to get a mortgage broker to get me a fucking loan.  And you know how much they take?  6%.  For the mortgage broker?  A seller.  Yeah.  So when I sell my apartment, I'm losing 6%.  Right off the top.  Six?  Listen, that's thousands.  It doesn't sound like a lot. 
[03:32:00]  No, but it is when you're dealing with the cost of an apartment in New York City.  Is it millions?  No.  Are you out of your mind?  I live in a one bedroom.  Hell's Kitchen.  I was about to say.  It's a fucking millions.  It's a lot though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's more than your parents.  Are we?  Why would you say that?  Like if you were to buy your parents.  Yeah.  It's fucked up.  It's fucked up.  But like individually.  I'd pay $150 and $180.  I'm not going to tell you who, but that's what I'd pay.  $150, $180.  That's fucked.  For both of them?  I'd do.  Maybe $310. 
[03:32:30]  No, no.  I'd do like do, do.  I'd get a deal.  I'd go do it.  If they come together.  Oh, Jesus.  They're not going to be happy to hear that.  They liked you before.  $150, $180 is pretty good.  Not for human beings.  My mom for one.  That's it?  She's probably got more years out of her than my parents.  No, my mother's younger.  Is she?  Yeah.  She had my sister when she was 15.  She had me when she was 18.  Oh, okay.  She was banging in a bush with a Schlitz at 15.  All right.  So I'll go to 105 then.  I'll take her.  All right.  There you go.  I'm going to get right over you.  Matt in Pennsylvania. 
[03:33:00]  Sam, what's that?  Chilling.  Happy birthday, brother.  Thank you, my friend.  Hey, do me a favor.  Mm-hmm.  All that dope that's trying to be second mic with you, that it's pre-approved, not pre-qualified.  He says pre-qualified.  He's not a dope.  He's a nice guy.  No, but first of all, you're a dope.  Second of all, dope back to you.  And third of all, he's not trying to be second mic.  He is second mic.  I'm first mic.  What?  It's Bob and Sam.  Listen, it's second of all.  First mic. 
[03:33:30]  No, you're taking up time and you're, they're not going to love you yet.  And third of all, I'm so glad I made you mad with my fuck up.  I hope you got to.  Sorry, man.  Hey, Smokey and the Bandit, go fuck yourself.  Fucking redneck and jizz bag.  Okay, now I get it.  Sorry, go ahead.  Sean in Austin.  Hey there, Sam.  Happy birthday, buddy.  Thank you.  I know this one's going to be a bad one, too.  I know you set me up.  And yes, I'm eating a banana.  No, no, no, no.  I actually, I'm honored.  I'm actually honored to say I do you.  Nobody cares about your banana, Bob. 
[03:34:00]  It's the third time you mentioned eating a banana.  Sorry.  Go on, Sean.  Sam, I've got a little bit of a birthday present for you, man.  Yeah?  You know, I remember last, was it a week before, E-Rock was saying nobody does parodies of anybody else but him.  But I actually did one for Sal.  Is that right?  It's pretty good.  Roland liked it.  He commented about it on Twitter.  And your name's Sean, too?  Everybody that does parody songs for ONA is named Sean.  Yeah, and here's the funny thing. 
[03:34:30]  I'm a different Sean B. than the guy who made the Blackbird one.  That's not that funny.  I've got to be honest.  Why do you think it's such...  You thought Sean was going to attack you, and he didn't.  Hey, he said...  And now you're still being venomous towards him.  One second.  Sean, I wasn't being mean.  You said it was funny, and I didn't laugh, and I just want to be honest with you that it wasn't that funny.  So maybe you should have...  The word you should have chose was interesting.  Were you interested in it?  Yes.  Okay.  All right, well, listen.  We'll find the song and maybe play it today, but maybe we'll save it for Monday for ONA. 
[03:35:00]  I'm going to hear it.  It sounds good.  It's soundcloud.com slash Sean Breeding.  That's S-D-A-N.  Oh, good.  Now everybody just went there.  Yeah, maybe at some point Sal can come in here and play the song.  I want to hear it.  I want to hear it.  Mark, you have something for Bob A.  Hey, happy birthday, Sammy.  Thank you.  Bobby, how don't you just glaze over the story of how a ghost got your wife pregnant?  I tried to...  Well, here's the deal.  I tried to get to it, but Sam fucking just... 
[03:35:30]  Let's go to the calls because he wants fucking accolades today.  Well, I'm not going to let people who called in to say happy birthday to me wait on hold like a rude person.  That's what you do, and then you make it have value.  I'm the nicest guy on ONA.  You give it value.  Do you understand?  Yeah.  When you make them wait, if you just go right to them, they think it's that easy.  You make them wait a little bit, and then it gives value to it.  Bob, while we're talking about value, I heard a rumor.  I heard a ghost.  Listen, I am not fucking...  Oh, okay, go ahead.  I heard a ghost.  I am married to a woman. 
[03:36:00]  Okay.  What rumor?  Okay, go ahead.  I heard a ghost.  Yes.  Got your wife pregnant.  That's not rumor, by the way, that other thing.  Here's the thing.  I swear to God, the night before, we're in bed.  We have sex.  Nice.  We decide to take...  What's his name?  What's the guy's name from the Letterman?  Justin Stang.  Justin's father's advice.  Just let's relax.  Just have sex to have sex.  Was he in the room?  No.  He wasn't.  No, he was not.  Okay.  But he was on the phone as I was...  No, he wasn't.  Where do I stick it?  I know where to stick it. 
[03:36:30]  I don't know for sure.  I do.  Okay.  In the vajajaj.  Is that the one?  Or the cookie.  I call it the cookie.  That's so gross.  Because I'm a little fat.  Let me stick it in your cookie, honey.  So we had sex.  I go to bed.  And this really happened.  And I'm not this guy.  I don't have ghost stories.  I am not that guy.  I don't believe in...  I've never seen a ghost.  I wake up in the middle of the night.  I turn over.  My wife's mother is holding her, spooning her, rubbing her stomach. 
[03:37:00]  And I'm like, oh my God.  And then she turns and looks at me, evil, like, you shouldn't be seeing this.  What?  She said...  She didn't say it, but her eyes said it.  You saw...  Now, your wife's mother, I'm assuming, has passed.  She was dead for three years.  Now, when you saw this, did it look like an apparition?  Or did it look like a physical person?  It looked like a physical person, I would say.  I could see it.  I was her.  But did it look a little transparent, is what I'm saying?  Did it look like...  I don't remember.  I know that I saw her and I was so freaked out. 
[03:37:30]  Because all of a sudden, I'm sleeping.  Everything's great.  We made love.  I like to call it love.  It wasn't just dirty, rotten sex.  It was love.  It was love.  It was love.  It was trying to make life.  Candles.  The reason you're supposed to have sex.  Making life.  To make a life.  That's why you have a ding-ding and she has a cookie.  Ding-ding and cookie.  And fun juice shoots out.  Okay, it's serious.  To make life.  Satellite radio, but go on.  So...  To make a life.  If you're having sex not to make a life, you're just having sex to make a goofy face for six 
[03:38:00]  to eight seconds.  Right.  It's the feeling, too.  The feeling's good.  So, I roll over in the middle of the night.  I feel something, you know, like in the room.  And I roll over.  Was it a dick?  No, it wasn't a dick.  Okay.  Because sometimes you roll and there's a...  In your house.  I don't know.  In your house.  Oh, Sal's.  Yeah, yeah.  When he's upstate with those gay artists.  Right.  One of the gay artist boners is poking him.  And I roll over and she's...  I see this woman holding my wife, spooning my wife, rubbing her stomach.  In the bed.  In the bed.  And then she turns around.  Do you have a big enough bed for three people? 
[03:38:30]  King size, California.  She spins over.  Two dogs, too.  Whoa.  Spins over.  Now, did it look like...  Did it look like how you remembered your wife's mother looking?  Or was it kind of like the woman in the bathtub in The Shining where she was, like,  rotting away?  No, she was not rotting away.  Okay.  She was the way I remember her.  Like, it wasn't the Walking Dead version.  Old and almost bald.  Okay.  But that's how she was in life?  Yes.  Okay.  And she turned quickly and looked at me.  Not like I'm going to kill you, but you shouldn't see this. 
[03:39:00]  You're not supposed to be awake.  And I turned over and went to bed.  Like, you shut your eyes real tight?  Like, okay.  I turned over, shut my eyes tight, and went back to sleep.  Woke up the next day and was like,  you won't believe what the fuck happened last night.  Right.  That night, I was at the comedy cell.  I was still weirded out.  I told Louis C.K.  He's like, I guarantee you your wife's pregnant.  What?  He didn't think you were a fucking idiot for...  No, he didn't.  Wow.  Why?  Because I'm not saying that it's a ghost.  I'm not saying it happened.  It could have been in my mind.  I don't know.  There's some spirituality happening. 
[03:39:30]  That's the night she got pregnant.  So basically what I'm saying is,  is my wife's mother fucked my wife.  Okay, yeah.  And got her pregnant.  No, you wouldn't think to yourself,  well, what happened was,  the spirit of my wife's mother came,  realized that her daughter was pregnant,  and came to comfort her,  and no, you were like,  oh, what must have happened was,  she must have fucked her while I was asleep.  She took my jizz from the lower portion of her vag,  and pulled it up to where it's supposed to be,  because my penis isn't big enough to get it. 
[03:40:00]  So you think she shoved her fist and hand inside your wife?  No, I think she did it on the outside  with magnetic, like she has in her hands,  because she's a ghost.  This music is creepy.  She can pull the jizz up.  Right.  You ever see that magnetic face  when you have the stick and you can give them a mustache?  Yes, yes.  Like that, pulled it up to where it's supposed to be.  With a stick or with her hand?  I don't know.  You don't know.  Okay.  I don't know.  Honest to God, this really happened.  I believe you.  And I don't know if it's true. 
[03:40:30]  I don't know.  Did it freak you out?  Someone said it's just your brain  knowing that it worked  or wanting it to work so much that you had it.  Yeah.  Did you ever have a vision of her being pregnant before this?  Never.  Never.  That's why it's weird,  because I could see where there's some kind of chemical trigger  that your wife would see that,  because your wife's body would know it was pregnant.  But there's no way that you...  A year and a half in,  we tried everything.  My jizz was good. 
[03:41:00]  Her eggs were good.  Everything was good.  And then that's the night she got pregnant.  That's the night we had the kid.  That's crazy.  To me.  What if...  It was crazy.  And I can see it like it happened yesterday.  It never left you.  If I saw, I can still see.  And so, okay.  So, was it...  Did it look like your apartment?  Everything was exactly...  I was in my apartment.  It was in my bed.  No, but what I'm saying is...  I was awake.  If it was...  So it's not a dream.  I was awake.  Like, I was awake, I think.  Holy fuck.  I'm 90% sure I was awake. 
[03:41:30]  But you felt awake.  I was awake.  Yeah, I rolled over.  You remember it like a memory, not like a dream.  I remember...  Exactly.  Good.  That's why you're the host...  Right.  ...of the Bob and Sam show.  That's why you said...  Okay, well, we do...  Okay.  Because it's my birthday today.  So it's...  Yeah, the Bob and Sam show.  Happy birthday special.  Okay, well...  Is that what it is?  Sam...  Do you know how happy it makes me that that guy is mad that I'm the second...  How happy...  He's probably still mad.  I bet he pulled over and punched his fucking windshield.  God damn it, that Bob Kelly!  I hope he hurt his hand on his vent.  So...  Yeah. 
[03:42:00]  You remember it like it was a memory.  You have to pre-qualify for...  Right.  Pre-qualify was the word you were like...  You remember it like it was a memory.  Yes.  And in your mind's eye, as you recall this...  My mind's eye.  Third eye.  Everything...  Yeah.  No, your third eye, I think, is the dick.  Oh.  But the mind's eye, I think, might be the fourth.  Yeah, yeah.  You remember...  Are you sure that wasn't somebody who molested you?  When you were a kid that told you that?  I guess we can't be short, can't we?  We could be.  Memories get repressed.  I don't have a memory of it.  If I take my dick out and you get hypnotized and you start sucking it, like it's a cotton... 
[03:42:30]  Oh, good.  It was a callback, but it wasn't going to work.  Go ahead.  So...  Yeah.  I'm glad you cut it off when you did.  Yeah.  Smart.  That's why you're experienced comic.  Everything, though, in your apartment was as it is.  Because if it's a dream, you know, stuff's going to be weird.  Listen, I can't...  I'm going to tell you right now.  Tell me.  I was...  It was my apartment.  I wasn't in a fucking dream sequence.  There wasn't a midget with a unicorn floating by.  It wasn't Tony Soprano putting peanuts in a Coke machine?  It was not... 
[03:43:00]  No, not that.  It was no...  It was not a dream.  I was awake.  I woke up, rolled over, looked at my wife.  Somebody was holding her.  I flipped out.  I was like, what the fuck?  Turned around.  Did you say anything?  No.  In my head, I said, what the fuck?  Sure.  Because I'm scared of ghosts.  I'm scared.  I'm scared, too.  I've seen lots of movies.  I'm scared.  Dude, I am...  Let me tell you something.  I'm scared of them.  I can't watch...  I can't...  There's horror movies I want to see.  I can't go by myself.  Because I scream.  I'm not kidding you, dude. 
[03:43:30]  Dude, once you're in Westchester, we're going together.  Girl, where are we going to go?  To the Alamo Drafthouse?  It's right by my house.  I know.  Fucking ghetto neighborhood.  It's not ghetto.  It's the worst Babies R Us on the fucking planet Earth.  Anyway.  No, anyway, nothing.  Fucking shitty elevator.  Yeah, that's what you want.  Babies R Us has graffiti in the elevator.  There's gangs taking elevator rides.  Have you ever seen Insidious?  Yes.  Are you worried that you...  What if you have like an Insidious baby?  I'll tell you why that movie is the scariest movie of all time to me.  One of them. 
[03:44:00]  Wow.  Dagos.  Yes.  They have...  By the way...  Dagos.  He rock is in my ear.  Making fun of you.  He's going, uh, Dagos?  He brought this up already.  I wasn't making fun of him.  I said this...  He brought this up before.  That's how we found out about Insidious.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, so he's...  So he's...  Make fun of him, not me.  I didn't bring it up.  So you tell me this.  Are you worried that you have a little Insidious baby?  No.  Well, what if the ghost...  Like, now it's communicating with ghosts.  It was her mother.  It wasn't some strange fucking old lady...  Darth Maul?  Who fucking murdered Indians in my house. 
[03:44:30]  Okay.  And there's Indian bones underneath my fucking apartment.  Good point.  Good point.  It was her mother helping.  It wasn't some strange dude.  What if your baby now becomes friends with Casper then?  Casper's not real.  That's not confirmed.  That is confirmed.  It is?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  All right.  I didn't know.  There's no...  I didn't fucking know.  Casper...  Doesn't it suck, Casper?  The friendly ghost.  Shitty Casper.  Why don't they just call him gay?  Casper, the homosexual ghost.  Yeah.  He's just a little goth gay kid.  He's Sal when he's a ghost. 
[03:45:00]  Is Sal gay?  No.  Not...  I mean, not...  Howdy will be by the time he hits 30.  You never let me finish my scenario with that.  No?  All right.  Enough with the music.  You're still going...  Let me...  That was way overproduced, by the way.  Let me use this as a transition.  We'll go to Rick in Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  Happy, happy birthday to you.  Happy, happy birthday to you.  You're good to grow, so count the candles and grow.  Happy, happy birthday to you.  To you. 
[03:45:30]  To you.  Happy birthday, Sam.  That was great, Rick.  That was terrific.  That was a great one.  Really nice.  That guy put some effort into it.  That was like original.  It was really nice.  I've never heard the song before.  Let me go to Dave in Maryland.  Sam, start embracing your blackness.  Happy birthday to you.  Oh!  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Yeah.  Amen, brother.  Love that, Dave.  Love that.  That was a good one.  That's some Stevie Wonder shit. 
[03:46:00]  So, uh...  Yeah.  How soon are you going to be a Westchester resident?  Um, next month, I think.  I'm renting in Ardsley.  Mm-hmm.  And then I got to...  See, this is what sucks.  Why would you not tell me that you were already renting?  Like, why wouldn't you call me up and be like, dude, I'm living in Westchester now.  We can hang.  Well...  Makes me think we're not actually friends.  We are friends.  And when I get up there, I'll call you and we'll hang.  All right.  But let's just make sure that I get up there first, okay?  All right.  I like to make sure everything's, you know...  Copacetic?  That's the word I was looking for.  Yeah.  But here's the deal. 
[03:46:30]  Although if you're in Westchester, kosher is the word.  You have to...  You have to...  I have to sell my place first, rent, and then buy.  Got you.  Because it's so hard for a comedian to get a loan because...  Because you don't take anything seriously.  Everything's jokes.  No, that's not it.  Oh.  That's not it.  Oh.  It's because we have companies that the money goes into.  I don't get paid.  LLCs?  I don't get paid.  My company gets paid.  And they don't understand.  For some fucking reason, the bank doesn't understand that that's me too. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So you have to prove all this crazy shit.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy.  Crazy.  Crazy.  I have an LLC.  I know what you're talking about.  You do?  Yeah.  What is it called?  Not Sam.  Really?  Yes.  It's nice.  Yes.  Mine's not you.  We both have not.  I love that.  That's so fun.  Fun.  Just fun.  Are we going to go to that big new mall up in Yonkers?  Yeah.  That's a great mall.  The outdoor thing?  With the, yeah, the outdoor, like a little town.  I don't remember.  Who cares?  Let's make a name up right now.  Okay. 
[03:47:30]  Outdoor Fun Spot.  I like it.  Cool.  I like it.  Fun Spot.  How about Grown Up Jungle Gym?  I don't like that.  How about Grown Up Fun Spot?  Grown Up Fun Spot.  I like that.  Let me go to Kate in New Jersey.  How about Gay Times?  No, I'm not calling it Gay Times because we're not going there.  Why?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, I just got a text from Justin Stengel.  This is good news for you too, Bob Kelly.  What?  He wants to take us both to dinner in Armonk, appetizers included.  Whabang.  Apps included.  Are we talking dinner at a nice restaurant or like a cheesecake factory? 
[03:48:00]  Or are we talking like a shitty place?  Like an Applebee's.  Yeah.  No, cheesecake.  Applebee's is good.  Cheesecake.  I love Applebee's.  Applebee's is good.  Riblets?  Yeah.  Go fuck yourself.  Kate in New Jersey.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  I actually wanted to give some insight to seeing your mother-in-law the night she got  pregnant.  What?  What do you mean?  Huh?  Do you know?  What are you?  You saw his mother-in-law?  Hang on.  Let her, Sam?  There's a lot of information in that sentence. 
[03:48:30]  I only caught like the tail end of this.  I just got in the car.  Nice.  I was hearing that I'm actually pregnant now, too.  Okay.  Congratulations, my dear.  Thank you.  It's a boy.  It's not a boy.  It's a girl.  First of all, I have dyslexia.  And when I say something, I mean the exact opposite.  I forgot to mention that.  Really?  Okay.  Well, that is definitely good.  Her name's Kathy.  My name's Kathy.  Babies aren't born with a name.  You just name them.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  She wants to be named Kathy. 
[03:49:00]  She's telling me that now.  No, we already have a name.  And we're going to go.  Yeah, but no, but what she wants is not the name you're picking.  She wants Kathy.  And could be transgender, because I saw a boy first.  Kathy Michael.  Well, I was pregnant before, and it was a boy, but I was pregnant.  That's what that was.  That's what I was.  That's what that was.  Listen, first of all, that's what I was talking about.  And what happened with that pregnancy?  Well, it's...  No, no, no.  I don't care about what happened with that pregnancy.  Tell me about the ghost.  Okay.  Tell me about the ghost.  Well, okay.  Here we go.  When I was 21, I actually died in surgery. 
[03:49:30]  And after I was revived, this is no joke, when I was revived, I started getting sensitivity  to things like that.  And so, swear to God, swear to God, didn't believe in that crap before, and weird shit  started happening afterwards.  She didn't even describe it.  What I am telling you is, coming from a pregnant woman, I think what happened was she knew  she was pregnant that night, and that's why she showed herself. 
[03:50:00]  That's just my, you know...  So you think Bobby saw a ghost?  Mm-hmm.  It was the real ghost of his mother-in-law.  Really?  I do.  And that the ghost realized her daughter was pregnant, and she came to comfort her daughter?  I don't know if it was necessarily the comfort.  I think she was just kind of making a statement.  So she's not really a nice mother.  Oh, fuck.  She was just...  Well, I wouldn't know.  Dude, I'm getting goosebumps.  I'm not as psyched as I would never claim to be.  Nothing like that.  But I do think that they can see ahead a little bit. 
[03:50:30]  I'm sorry, Kate.  This is too much for me.  Chris.  Jesus.  You're scaring me.  Hey.  Yeah.  Sam, happy birthday, buddy.  I got a nice little song for you that my family's been singing for 20 years.  Great, great, great.  This is going to be a Ku Klux Klan song?  Happy birthday, happy birthday, birthday to you.  Come on.  Happy birthday.  Yeah.  Happy birthday, happy birthday, birthday to you.  We're having a party.  Happy birthday, buddy.  Thank you.  That's not from his family. 
[03:51:00]  I heard that on a tape.  No, no, no.  You can buy that tape.  No, you can get that on a tape.  I think his family did it.  It's on a tape.  John in South Carolina.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Oh, I never had it so good.  Listen.  What?  What's this show, Bobby?  It does amazing things to people.  Is it really?  Yes.  Is this show what makes you have it so good?  It's been a good day.  How about this?  Listen.  What'd you get blown in a Dunkin' Donuts?  Why is it so good?  This is one of the old guys that Sal lives with.  Oh, this is what you...  So you had a good art session this morning.  I got to tell you the goddamn story because my arm hairs were standing up when you were telling 
[03:51:30]  it.  I'm not a spiritual person at all.  I never have been.  I'm a testicular cancer survivor, so we were having trouble having kids.  We were trying for a few years.  Right.  And he just saw the ghost.  That floating testicle just started floating in the room and he knew his wife was pregnant.  Stop.  Let him tell his story.  You're right, Bob.  That was way over the line.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Walnut.  I'm at the gym the next morning, like 6.30 in the morning, running on the treadmill.  Nothing new.  That's what I always do.  And my wife's grandmother, I have this weird vision, my wife's grandmother holding a baby 
[03:52:00]  right in front of me while I'm running.  What?  I had this weird feeling of like peace.  It's unexplained.  I sound like a fag at explaining it, but it's like I had this weird feeling come over me  and everything was cool.  I felt great and unexplainable and like it just ended.  I look around the gym.  Everything was just like it was before.  Wow.  And, you know, like three weeks later, my wife tells me she's pregnant.  Now we've got a six-month-old boy. 
[03:52:30]  So it was the weirdest thing.  I've told very few people because it sounds so weird.  Right.  It sounds fucking weird.  And here's the deal.  That could be, look, I've had people tell me that could be my super conscious, subconscious  mind just knowing that it worked or, you know.  But just creating this image, though, it's not like it's while you're sleeping.  Yeah, creating an image while you're awake.  Yeah, it's fucking weird.  But I think you can, your brain is that powerful.  You could do that.  Or, you know, I mean, maybe you saw a fucking ghost. 
[03:53:00]  I don't, I don't know what I saw, but I know that it was, I saw it.  That's all I know.  Yeah.  I can't, I'm not going to sit here and go, it was a ghost of my, I don't fucking.  But you saw some shit.  Yeah.  This guy was running.  Right.  With one nut on a treadmill.  He only had the one, right?  That's what he said.  You can't lose two and have a kid.  No, no fucking way.  Yeah, I think he knew.  He was running to the left.  He was just limping the whole time.  But that's crazy.  Blake.  That's crazy.  Blake, what a great name.  Blake is a good name.  That's a great name for a guy, Blake.  What's your name, Blake?  Blake, you probably fuck a lot of girls, yes? 
[03:53:30]  Uh, well, I've been married for 31 years, so I'm only going to commit, I'm only going  to say one.  Yeah, but you had your day up.  Yeah, go on.  Wink, wink, wink, last week at a truck stop.  Got it, Blake.  Loud and clear.  Go on with what you wanted to say.  Bob, I just wanted to comment about your vision.  I wanted to ask you, how long before that did your mother-in-law pass away?  It was three years.  Three years.  And there was no rotting? 
[03:54:00]  Three, no.  Okay.  No, she was.  Yeah, she didn't rot.  That's great.  It's happened to me twice.  It happened to me with my grandfather, and it happened to me with my dad when he passed  away.  I really, I'm not a religious person, I'm not a superstitious person, but I almost kind  of believe after I've talked to a few people, and I don't talk to that many people because  I don't want to be committed.  And you saw these people that had died, like, as people? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, the weirdest one was my grandfather, because we actually bought my grandfather's  house after he passed away.  And my grandmother moved into an apartment.  Right.  And-  Did you have a boy Sal with him?  I don't know.  Well, he passed away in the house.  He had a heart attack and passed away in the house just like-  Wow.  Or maybe like nine months before this happened, and we were starting to work on the house  and kind of remodel it. 
[03:55:00]  And I was asleep, and I got up to, because I heard a noise in my daughter's bedroom.  Right.  That was definitely what's-  And it wasn't you again.  It wasn't me.  It wasn't me.  I got up, and I had my grandfather standing over my bed.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That creeps me out.  You didn't scream, though, right?  You know, I wanted to scream.  At the same time, I knew because it was my grandfather. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  I got to get out of this call.  I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.  These are freaking me out.  Justin in Oklahoma.  We need a happy birthday call.  Quick.  I got one for you.  Let's do it.  Happy birthday to you.  A happy birthday to you.  Every day of the year.  May you feel Jesus near us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And the best year you've ever had.  Thank you very much, Justin.  That was terrific.  That was a good one.  Dude, JC in there.  That really was terrific.  I got...  And you know, Bob, as I get older... 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  As I get older and I...  And you're getting older.  You're not the twink I once knew.  I'm 30 years old, Bob.  You're not as hot as you used to be.  Why would you put it that way?  I'm just saying that you're not as...  I wouldn't...  You can say young.  You can say twinkish.  But hot is like...  I'm not walking in a room and going, wow, anymore.  Less physically attractive is what you're saying.  I'm just saying that you're still...  You're a good looking young man.  Okay.  But you're not a hot twink anymore.  I'm just saying...  Yeah, I'm saying...  Mortality.  I'm saying your hips are wider.  Why would you say it?  Because I'm looking at them.  But why bring it up?  But I know.  These pants are tighter than I used to wear. 
[03:56:30]  I don't like the hair you get.  It's on your arm.  I've always had hair on my arm.  You have the same amount of hair as Ellen now.  I don't like it.  I was in my 20s.  I don't like it.  When we met.  I don't like it.  But what the fuck happens after we die?  I'll tell you what happens.  Tell me.  I think...  I think you become another human or another animal.  Reincarnation?  I think...  So what happened to the human that your mother-in-law was supposed to be in?  Huh?  I think I've had a bunch of lives.  Really?  Yeah, I told you. 
[03:57:00]  I was a cowboy once.  Okay.  Hey, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm serious.  You are?  I had a psychic tell me it was true.  What was your name as a cowboy?  I don't know.  I didn't get...  I don't know my name.  I believe it was probably something like Billy.  Could have been Buffalo Bob.  Hey, hey, man.  What the fuck is that?  No, no, no.  Because cowboys call themselves...  That's not a...  I swear to God, I had a friend that committed suicide that watched...  She said that he watches over me now.  And he's the guy, every time I get down, he was a goofy, funny guy that committed suicide. 
[03:57:30]  When I was a cowboy back in those days.  And he committed suicide.  He's one of my guardian angels now that watches over me every time I get down and depressed.  He's the one who makes me laugh.  Something goofy will happen.  Right.  And something silly will happen that will make me laugh and snap me out of it.  That's what she said to me.  But if he's your guardian angel, right?  One of them.  I have a few.  But if you have guardian angels, why aren't those guardian angels in other people?  I don't understand.  Why aren't they helping my career?  Why aren't they fucking...  Why are they letting other people...  Why are other people's guardian angels way better than mine? 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  And they fucking help them get TV shows?  Apparently, Louis CK...  And sell out the fucking Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow?  Now, is that true?  I heard another rumor.  You're going to be at the Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow?  I'm at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  Is that Vinnie Brand's Stress Factory?  Yeah, it's my Vinnie Brand.  I got a TV show coming out.  I will live on a farm.  I have 15 kids and five goat and a fucking chicken.  That's him, right?  On the TV show?  Yeah, that's me.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm Vinnie Brand.  Vinnie Brand!  I love Vinnie Brand.  Yeah, I'm there tonight. 
[03:58:30]  Tonight, two shows.  Tomorrow, two shows.  And that's it.  Wow.  And that's it.  Can I give you a big announcement?  Oh, shit.  This better be true.  I think it's true.  I hope so.  This is from Jim Norton, and he doesn't lie to me.  Oh, God.  Jim Norton doesn't lie to anybody.  He's one of your guardian angels, because he makes you laugh when you feel sad.  This is, and I quote from Jim Norton, a text I got from, take a guess.  Who?  C.  C.  M.  M. 
[03:59:00]  Punk.  Yeah.  Okay.  Tell Sam Roberts.  Yes.  That's what he said.  Yes.  I hate him.  Why?  And his wife can do better.  And happy birthday.  Wow.  From C.  M. Punk.  Can we clap?  Can we clap?  Eric, clap, Eric.  Because he's an asshole.  He says the truth.  Yeah.  And you know, because he's saying how he feels, but.  But he's saying happy birthday.  But he's saying, but you know what?  Happy birthday.  I hate you, but I like you, though.  Yeah, your wife.  Happy birthday.  Should be with me.  Because you know what happened last time when I was out in L.A. doing all those wrestling 
[03:59:30]  interviews?  Yeah.  Jess was the camera person for me.  Oh, God.  Wrong move.  She was just my assistant.  Dude, never bring a girl into your business.  Well, I don't have anybody to bring with me.  Yeah, you do get somebody else.  You were busy.  Well, dude, get somebody.  I'll do the camera.  You don't bring your girl.  You don't want your girl meeting CM Punk.  She's my partner in crime.  Dude, you don't want your girl, your wife meeting somebody better than you.  Well, that's what happened.  Yeah, of course it happened.  And then Punk, he does this move in the interview where he's talking about his sunburn.  So he lifts up his shirt and it's like, I don't know, and he's all tatted up and muscular 
[04:00:00]  and like, you know, sexy.  Yeah.  He owns a bus, millions of dollars.  Yeah.  Lives in a great town.  He's a big star.  Your girl's out in fucking New Rochelle.  Yeah.  Ghetto country.  It's not ghetto country.  We're not into Rochelle anymore.  It's fucking ghetto country.  But I could be like, that's the guy that said.  You have an afro that's fucking falling out like a.  It's not falling out.  It is.  Why would you say it?  You're going bald.  I've had the same hairline for the last several years and you keep saying I'm going bald.  Listen, dude, from a guy who used to fucking be into you. 
[04:00:30]  You know why Jess.  You're not the same.  Yeah, go ahead.  You know why Jess stays with me?  Yeah, I do.  Why?  I don't know.  She's weak-willed?  No.  That's incorrect.  Why?  You know, and you can tell this to CM Punk if you see him.  Yeah, I want to fucking see him.  The reason that Jess stays with me.  Yeah.  Is because CM Punk said happy birthday to me.  And.  Yeah.  Because of the I love you gifts.  What's the I love you gift?  Jess, what do you give her?  For instance, if you ask any girl, not just Jess, any girl, any woman, what the best gift  she ever got was.  Yeah. 
[04:01:00]  Without hesitation, without even thinking about it, she says her engagement ring.  Yeah, it is a big one.  And I got Jess a beautiful engagement ring.  It's so important.  It's not just a ring.  Yeah.  It's not just a sign of affection.  It's everything to her.  Every time she looks down at her finger, every time she washes her hands, every time someone  at the store hands her change, you get credit.  Every time she's on the subway, you get nervous that some dude's going to cut her finger off.  Exactly right.  Because it's so nice.  Especially when she's in Brazil for work.  No, we leave those at home, Jess.  We leave those at home.  Yeah. 
[04:01:30]  Every time she shows her friends, you get credit.  You get credit for that ring every day.  Right.  Especially from those robbers.  It's actually what, it validates what type of man you are to all the, for friends.  Yeah.  It's got to be perfect is what you're saying.  Because the first thing they say is, he asked me, let me see it.  Let me see the ring.  And then all these girls go, he did good.  Dude, you know your girl.  She's texting pictures of the ring to her friends.  Yeah.  I don't allow her to have a phone, but go ahead.  You don't.  Okay.  Wow.  You get credit for that ring every day.  It's got to be perfect.
