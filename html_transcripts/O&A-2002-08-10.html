<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with Opie and Anthony sharing personal anecdotes about infidelity, with Anthony detailing elaborate, and ultimately unsuccessful, attempts at concealing his cheating.  This leads to a humorous discussion about various methods of avoiding detection after infidelity, culminating in Anthony's tale of being busted by a single out-of-place pubic hair.

Andrew Dice Clay then arrives in the studio. The conversation revolves around his large sunglasses, smoking habits, and his entourage, particularly "Club Soda Kenny."  Dice Clay discusses his career, including past opening acts (Rich Voss and Jason Rubito, who is present but largely silent), movie roles (mentioning *Brain Smasher* and his own films, including a contentious discussion of the character Tony Schlongini), and his social and comedic viewpoints. A phone call with "Frenchie" results in a heated exchange filled with homophobic slurs from Dice Clay.  Further discussion of Dice Clay's movie roles and impersonations, including a story about a car accident involving an actor he impersonates, concludes this segment.

The show returns after a week-and-a-half summer break, acknowledging listener complaints about the unannounced absence. Anthony recounts his frustrating Miami vacation experiences, focusing on the prevalence of Spanish speakers, loud music, and communication difficulties, contrasting it with a more enjoyable Colorado fishing trip.  The focus shifts to "Staple Gun Roulette," a game featuring Penthouse Pet of the Year winners Melissa Ann and Alexis Winston.  Numerous contestants, primarily from Staten Island and New Jersey, participate, pulling down their pants and potentially receiving a staple to the buttocks.  The game continues across multiple segments, featuring varying reactions from contestants and concluding mid-game.

Continuing the "Staple Gun Roulette" segment, several contestants endure staples, with some showing more visible pain and reaction than others; one contestant doesn't immediately realize they were stapled. The winner is to receive a trip to WWE's King of the Ring.  Post-game, a conversation with Melissa Ann and Alexis Winston covers breast augmentation and a treadmill accident involving a dog leash.  The discussion shifts to a *Details* magazine article about paying for sex, followed by Opie's claim to be able to guess a woman's age by examining her genitalia.  An attempted phone call with Tommy Lee ends abruptly when the conversation touches upon his sex tape and Pam Anderson's Hepatitis C accusations, leaving the hosts frustrated.

A later segment focuses on a phone call with Tommy Lee, where the hosts pressed him about Pamela Anderson's claims of him giving her Hepatitis C. Lee eventually hangs up, claiming a lack of prior agreement on the topic, leading to the hosts calling him a "pussy."  The show then moves to a discussion about Spaz's claim of being urinated on from a high-rise building.  Spaz describes the incident, with the hosts and callers offering alternative explanations,  leading to a humorous mock news report by "Tom Brokaw" on "urine terrorism" in New York City, complete with exaggerated sound effects. The segment concludes with further ribbing of Spaz.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's Opie and Anthony. Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, Opie.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes. I had to bring some of the story, though, that I've got to tell. 
[00:00:30]  Back in my younger days, back in my younger days, Opie, I was seeing a girl, girlfriend, and I was cheating.  I was cheating on her. I finally decided to make the jump and cheat.  You, Anthony, were cheating.  Yes, I was. I finally decided to plunge right in and cheat on this girl.  Couldn't get them all in one room, huh?  Shut up!  There's no photographic evidence. 
[00:01:00]  No, this was, you know, I was single. I wasn't married. This was well before my marriage.  It was just, you know, seeing a girl.  Yeah.  And I decided to cheat.  Cheat?  But then I had to go see the girl, you know?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  What to do?  What to do?  I had certain fragrances and aromas on my hands and whatnot.  Oh, boy.  Now I'm like, all right, what do you do?  What do you do?  Yeah.  You make sure, when this happens, you're driving a car that is not dependable. 
[00:01:30]  Not dependable.  So that way, when I doused my hands in gasoline and grease and oil and wiped it all over me  and drove to the house and walked in the door.  The first thing out of my mouth is, son of a bitch in car.  And as she came over to me, I went, I'm full of gasoline.  I got to take a shower.  And I was able to bypass that situation with petroleum.  So how did she eventually catch you, Anthony? 
[00:02:00]  No, you know something?  I don't cheat for long.  That's what happens.  I leave the situation.  Believe me.  I don't cheat for long.  I never cheated for very long.  It's not something I leave, go for a long time.  The guilt gets to you.  No, it's not the guilt.  I would rather move on to a brand new pooh-ha.  If I'm cheating, it means I'm not happy with my situation. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  So then I would move on.  So, you know, you have to cover yourself with gasoline and oil.  No, you don't.  You've got to think quicker on your feet.  What?  Norton, what?  You just go home and you go, I'm sorry, I'm late.  I stopped off to do a little bass fishing.  Should I bring tackle?  Should I bring a tackle box in the house with me?  Should I have done that?  Or say you were shoving caviar into your face.  Little fish eggs all over your fingers.  And if the girl's name was Caviar, that would be even funnier. 
[00:03:00]  Shoving caviar into my face.  Dude, you know what?  Yes.  Yes, Opie.  I got caught cheating once in Buffalo when I was doing radio up there because my girlfriend  at the time found one pubic hair.  Oh, really?  Hell, is she Quincy?  One?  How many would she pick it up with her tweezers and put it in a bag and send it down to the  lab?  And I folded.  And you smiled.  And I folded like a cheap tent. 
[00:03:30]  You did?  Folded.  Ass.  Where did she find it?  She pulls the sheets away and there is one pubic hair.  And I guess it was a different...  It was a different color.  Color than...  Get out of here.  Nailed.  Wow.  Nailed.  Whew.  Why were you so bad under pressure?  You should have just gone, why?  What are you talking about?  How does she identify it as one of those and as someone else's and what... 
[00:04:00]  Wait a minute.  What color hair did she have?  Blonde.  And what color hair was the pubic question?  Brown.  Brown.  And she was like completely blonde?  Oh, yeah.  Some girls got the blonde hair up top and then below you're like, hey, hey.  No.  How about you?  Nice.  No.  You're blonde?  Yes.  It's not about me, douchebag.  It ain't about him.  I could have said it was yours.  Well, no, no. 
[00:04:30]  Because she knows I'm...  Wow, that's a tricky situation now.  Because there is nothing you can say.  Where did it come...  Did you have a cat?  Eyelash.  Yeah, an eyelash.  I know.  Even eyelash color.  Well, you know what?  A piece of thread.  You don't break down.  Yeah, it's from this girl.  I said, home.  You're the worst.  Yeah.  Now, you should have jumped on it and said, who the hell did you have in this bed?  Look at Rick nodding.  Yeah.  Good move.  Good move.  That's a good ploy.  I folded.  You did.  You folded.  Done. 
[00:05:00]  Did you go, ah, ah, ah, ah?  Did you stutter?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The guilt was all over my face.  Awful.  So then I proceeded to do my own threesome, Anthony.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, but it didn't get quite the publicity-minded.  No.  Two big metropolitan papers.  Well, maybe old Jimmy Norton can have one and then participate in this discussion.  Pony up, whores.  All right.  Opie, you sure it was pubic hair and not back hair?  Very funny.  Rich with a big callback.  Very nice.  To one of Opie's previous relationships. 
[00:05:30]  No, that was a one-timer.  Right.  That was done to get rid of the old virginity.  The Wookie.  The Wookie.  I don't know if he had sex with a Wookie.  Bonnie, the hairy back.  Opie.  She didn't have a hairy back.  She had a mane.  Opie.  She was beautiful.  But she had this weird birth defect, which gave her hair from her neck all the way down  to her tailbone in one thin line. 
[00:06:00]  It is a weird birth defect.  It's called being a silverback.  That's awful.  Her name?  DeVita.  No?  No.  Okay.  I thought maybe.  But it was quite unusual.  Yes.  God damn.  I was not able to go out with her because of that.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  It turned you off.  Oh, yeah.  Was she hairy anywhere else?  No.  She was gorgeous.  A lot of hair.  I'm not lying.  Really?  It was gorgeous.  Did you mention it or did she tell you that I have this stuff?  No. 
[00:06:30]  I had to make believe.  I, you know, I was cool with it.  How do you take her to the beach with her chaka stripe?  Wow.  I can't.  We have her running down the street after I hope he broke up with her.  There she goes.  All right.  Listen.  We got to take a break because the legend is here, Anthony.  Oh.  Andrew Dice Clay is outside the studio.  He is, is he?  Hey, I'm here, huh?  Hey, jerk off.  Hey, jackass.  Hold on.  Okay.  We're going to give you the big intro in a minute here. 
[00:07:00]  Look at your.  Your sunglasses are so big.  Dice, your sunglasses are gigantic.  They're gigantic.  That's so I can put a big fat chick's ass on them.  How are you doing, legend?  You're not laughing at Anthony?  That was funny.  I didn't even hear him.  I'm not in the mood for this.  What is he not in the mood for?  That was funny.  I'm going to go on the radio today.  I'm here.  Why?  You're.  Huh?  You're.  I'm not comfortable in the studio.  Where do you get those sunglasses? 
[00:07:30]  Your sunglasses are like the windshield of a 747.  Look at those things.  Where do you get those?  Let me set myself.  Oh.  You all right?  Yeah, they're big.  I'm all set.  They're big glasses.  They're very big.  I like the blue blockers.  Looks like you got it all figured out.  They block out the blue.  It looks like you got it all figured out.  It looks like you're going scuba diving.  What do you got, goggles?  You got it all figured out.  Hey, I'm goggles of paisano.  You got it all figured out now.  Yeah.  You're scuba diving.  You got it all figured out. 
[00:08:00]  What's the matter, Dice?  No, I'm all set.  I like your glasses.  They're big.  You got it all figured out.  Big in life, like Dice.  I'm all set now.  You need an air tank on your back with glasses.  I'm all set.  Scoop and goggles.  All right.  We'll take a break.  I'm doing Old Navy commercials because that old broad time.  Because you got it all figured out, right?  Because I got it all figured out.  You got it all figured out.  Right.  I was just at Harley Davidson.  Oh.  At Lexington.  Yeah.  Between 56 and 57.  Oh, boy.  That means you...  I told them I'll be. 
[00:08:30]  Is this Dice Cool?  I think we got Dice Cool today.  I just walked in.  You got to...  Don't get me mad.  I'm not getting you mad.  I just walked in.  You got a Pepsi and a cigarette there.  I know this is what you do.  Yeah.  This is all you do.  So, I'm buying a T-shirt.  This is all I do.  I'm buying a T-shirt.  Yeah.  Over there.  We got a break.  Negotiating a price.  Oh, you got to go on a break?  Yeah.  Well, if you're asking me something.  Because I wanted to give you the plug.  No, I know.  But can we do that when we come back?  That's what I was saying.  I'm going to give you another...  I'm all set now.  I'm going to give you another plug when you come back. 
[00:09:00]  You were going to come back and give me the intro.  I was going to...  You know what I mean?  New guys...  It's been a while.  You know what I mean?  I come in.  I'm ready.  He starts.  Well, I did not.  Their sunglasses are a little too big.  Because they're...  For who?  For anybody.  For you.  For you.  Maybe for you.  Maybe for you.  They seem big.  They seem very large.  They are large.  They're like the Hubble telescope thing.  That's very good.  No.  Are you able to see...  Maybe I wear glasses like him.  Are you able to see...  Maybe I...  Give me those glasses.  Are you pointing to Ben? 
[00:09:30]  No, just for a minute.  No, Ben.  Give me the glasses.  Ben doesn't play.  He doesn't take his glasses off.  Ben doesn't play.  Take John's.  Take John's glasses.  No, those are different kinds of...  Yeah, those are more John's glasses.  They're little, though.  They're little.  Yeah, see how tiny those are?  Now, look what happened.  Now, let's see.  Put them on, guys.  Look what I do.  Look what I do.  Whatever his name is.  It's John's glasses.  Actually, I just want that on.  Wow.  Looks like you're a good movie professor.  With this on, and I'm all set.  Now, you're nice and cool.  Yeah.  Okay.  But I go back to these glasses.  Yeah.  The little stupid ones. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Actually, McBurdy, actually, I was just thinking that perhaps I could come over later and break  your...  Actually, I thought that would be very nice.  Maybe later, once you get it in a cast, I'll come over and sign it.  As you go from one glass to another.  Thanks for a great radio bit, Dice.  Now, you change back to the little...  So, actually, the other day, this chick is, uh, is touching my d**k, actually. 
[00:10:30]  I don't think that'll go through.  Now, you go back to the big glasses.  Now, who knows?  Forget it.  All right.  Forget it now.  Where's the guy with...  All right.  You're going to do it all day?  Get out of here.  What?  You're going to do it all day?  All right.  Come on.  I thought we're going to...  We're going to break.  We've got to do a break.  And then Westbury.  And then the Beacon.  And then Holly Davis.  We've got to figure out a better ways of doing plugs.  I've got to be honest.  Yeah?  Because the general populations know, like, when you're doing a plug, you've got to... 
[00:11:00]  I don't know how to do it.  You've got to work it in subtle?  Yeah.  Like when I do the Holly thing.  Right.  Holly Davidson.  That's very subtle.  They gave me a 3% discount to say their name.  What are you getting?  They gave you that jacket for free.  They gave me a t-shirt and a jacket.  You got nothing for free.  You got that t-shirt for free.  For nothing.  Free.  No, I didn't get...  I had to pay.  They didn't see the couple shirts I stuffed in the bag.  The bad guy.  The bad guy.  You know what I mean?  We're going to break.  We're going to talk to...  Hit me.  We're going to talk to...  Why are you going to break?  I'm going to move out now. 
[00:11:30]  We've got to go.  Now I'm in the mood for radio.  We're going to talk.  When I came in, I wasn't in the mood.  I had to get set.  You just will be back and you can talk.  All right.  You know what?  We're going to talk to you.  It's your show.  You're going to do what you're going to do anyway.  That's right.  You know what I mean?  Horror.  This Thursday.  Filthy horror.  Sex for Sam.  Three.  The Opian Anthony Show.  The Opian Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:12:00]  Hey, we're back with the Opian Anthony Show.  Our old pal in the studio.  We haven't seen him in a while, Anthony.  It's Andrew Dice Clay.  How come I can't hear me now?  Hey, we got...  You're playing games already.  No, no, no.  We got Dice's whole gang in here.  Yeah, actually.  All the annoying people that follow him around.  What is this?  Jesus.  Wait a minute.  There it is.  There it is.  Dice, we already discussed your glasses.  I got to bring up an observation.  It's entourage.  You got an ashtray in front of you and a cigarette, but you stopped smoking. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, so?  Everybody has...  So what are you doing?  It's not me.  It's Norton.  He's taking the ashtray out.  Like, I'm seeing an ashtray.  I'm going to start smoking.  Because he quit.  That's how he works it.  But you still buy cigarettes?  You know, he's one of those smokers that, you know, the minute you quit, you cough at  everybody else smoking.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, you shouldn't do that.  Smoking's a bad habit.  Yeah.  So is wiping your ears with a shower gun.  We're about to say that one. 
[00:13:00]  Of course.  I don't know.  Now, Dice, do you still buy cigarettes, though?  Yes.  And you hold them...  So what?  Don't you do things...  Not like that.  Not like that.  You know, you either commit to something or not.  That's kind of...  It looks kind of silly.  It's not like Dice.  I think Dice would go, I don't need cigarettes.  And you throw it away, like Dice.  I like the cigarettes.  Not like, oh, I'll hold them a while.  You've got to understand, I never liked the smoke.  Right.  I was never into smoke.  Right.  Smoke annoys me.  Right. 
[00:13:30]  So I just figured I've got to quit lighting them.  Oh, is that it?  But yet I'm getting the same rush.  What dictates when you have to throw one away?  What happens is you get all sogged out.  When it gets soggy?  It gets all soggy.  It gets all sogged out.  It's like when you've got to throw your chick away.  You know what I'm talking about.  I hear you.  Like you get one of those chicks, right?  Let's say you've been pinching your helmet all day long.  Right.  All right.  Right.  So you've built up like 52 full ounces, right? 
[00:14:00]  Okay.  That's the hot soup, right?  So you just keep unloading.  You just keep unloading, right?  All of a sudden, she's like a sponge that can't take no more.  Right.  Saturated.  That's how you work a cigarette.  And then you throw it away.  Why does Kenny have to be behind you?  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  Is he protecting you?  I mean, no one's-  I can't even read that.  I'm protecting the legend.  No one's going to beat you up around here.  Why does he have to stand right next to you like that?  He's making us all uncomfortable.  I'm his body god.  Do me a favor.  All right.  There you go.  Why is he making you uncomfortable?  Because he's all big and stuff. 
[00:14:30]  He can beat anyone up in here.  Yeah.  Well, look, we're all old friends here.  Everybody's happy.  Norton's here.  And Dice, turn us on to Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  Our little Jimmy Norton was opening up for Dice for quite a while.  And I look at him.  And it's all working out for everybody.  Now he's all set.  He's all set.  All set.  Sure.  Now I got Jason Rubito.  Jason.  Hi.  How are you?  Yeah.  He's my new opener.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  Does he talk?  Does he talk?  Yeah, he does good.  You got to see him.  Well, nodding really works on the radio. 
[00:15:00]  You know what?  He doesn't talk.  What do you care what he does?  What do you got embarrassed of?  I just want to see what he sounds like.  What do you mean?  What's he supposed to do?  Say hi.  I told him before we came up here.  You guys don't like when performers do bits.  Like this is like just what happens.  No, this is no bit, but I want the guy to say hi.  We got to hear what his voice sounds like, maybe.  The people want to hear what the guy that's opening up for Dice sounds like.  That's all.  He's got a lot of personality.  He's got a lot of personality.  Oh, he's got his personality. 
[00:15:30]  You see what I mean?  They're doing bits, Anthony.  No.  We're not doing any bits.  What does that mean?  You always say that.  They're doing bits.  And that's not.  I just said the guy's got a lot of personality.  And that's not.  He's got a lot of personality.  A lot of personality.  He's got personality.  He's got a lot of personality.  Walk personality.  That's not the guy that opens up for you, though.  But that's not the guy.  It's not the point.  That's another guy.  The point is.  That's a weird looking guy.  I don't want him to do his bits.  He's a weird looking guy.  Because what do you mean he's a weird looking guy? 
[00:16:00]  He's a little.  It's titanium Todd.  Yeah, I know.  It's Todd.  You know what that is.  Yeah.  How does he feel that he was second fiddle to Rich Voss?  Oh, thanks.  Hey, how do you feel you were second fiddle to Rich Voss?  What does that mean?  Dice wanted Rich Voss to open up.  You know, I actually forgot I even invited him to open for him.  Really?  Yes.  And then what?  Don't get me wrong.  I like Rich.  Yeah.  But if I don't see him or hear him, I never, ever think of him.  Ever.  Like, if you guys never brought, if nobody ever brought him up. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  And like 20 years from now, they go, oh, Rich Voss just came out to LA.  Oh, yeah, I remember that.  I forgot that that guy was alive.  Right.  That's how his audience feels, sure.  That's right.  Right after he leaves the stage, they forget about him.  He couldn't do it or something because of, um...  He shot a pilot.  Yeah.  He shot a movie for VH1 about, uh...  Something went on with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.  No, it's a, it's a, it's a pilot he's got for a show.  They did things the way men did comedy back then when comedy was done the way men did it. 
[00:17:00]  Like dinosaurs.  You hear me?  I hear me.  We all hear you.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like, yesterday I was having breakfast over there, like...  And today I'm having the same kind of breakfast.  Almost like, like that breakfast happened at that moment.  The way you would have things done back then. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  Like men did it.  Right.  All right.  I hear me.  Why hasn't Happy Face said anything yet?  He's listening the way he, remember the way he used to come up here back then.  Yeah.  Like years ago.  He was very scared.  The way men respected other men to say what they had to say, like their piece.  Right.  That's that then.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:18:00]  Happy Face, you want to say anything?  When the legend speaks, people listen.  Oh, is that a...  I can't believe it.  No, I was just making a statement.  All right.  Yeah, I understand.  And could we have Club Soda Kenny say something?  Sure.  We haven't heard him in a while because I think you kicked him out of your entourage.  Yeah, what happened?  Was there a falling out, Kenny?  There was no falling out.  It was the same thing like Rich Voss.  I was very sick.  You were sick?  Yeah.  What'd you have?  Don't talk about me.  Let's talk about Andrew.  I just...  You know what?  Number one, we were talking about Rich.  Did I compliment...  Did you see him? 
[00:18:30]  I'm not done talking about Rich.  Is his smile as beautiful as the sunrise?  You know what I mean?  And the ball of pen on his back.  I don't care.  You know what I'm saying?  You can't say that.  Is his smile as beautiful as the sunrise?  His smile is as beautiful as the sunrise.  Look at him and Dice is showing him that he's wild.  Do you want to...  His arches are as strong as the Barrazzano Bridge.  On his feet?  His arches?  How have you known about Dice's arches?  Like, how do you even know that? 
[00:19:00]  He doesn't.  Do you want to get with him?  He's the American legend.  Are you gay for him?  Is that it?  I would do anything he told me to.  Oh, my God.  And how do you feel about that, Dice?  Put your jacket on.  Put it...  Get on.  Wait outside.  What?  How do you feel that he would do anything for you?  I would put your mouth on me.  Even, you know, he would play with the balloon knot.  Yeah, he would do anything for you.  That means, like, treat you like...  You know, you could treat him like a woman.  What do you guys got a thing with faggots?  All of a sudden.  All of a sudden. 
[00:19:30]  You know, that people do.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Excuse me.  I'm protesting outside this show.  Okay?  I didn't know you were...  I had it all figured out.  You know, they're entitled to love, too.  We don't mind.  You know what I mean?  So what?  They're faggots.  So what?  They don't know how sick they is.  You know what I mean?  They need a good...  You know, like all we were doing, driving down here.  Look at her.  Look at that ass.  Look at her.  Look at her.  Look at her.  Look at this.  You know what I mean?  They're looking at...  Oh, look at him.  Right.  You know what I mean? 
[00:20:00]  Look at the way he cuts his burns.  Look at...  You know what I mean?  You had a problem with the gay people for many years, dude.  I never used to give them publicity.  No, they would protest outside your shows, guys.  Because they didn't get it, obviously.  They didn't like the way you would talk about the gays.  I would talk about the trans testicles, the bi-sickness that they have, that they can't decide.  You know, it was things like that.  You would talk about their rises.  No, no.  I would talk about the different kind of faggotitos that they put out there today.  They put out? 
[00:20:30]  Like, years ago, they had, like, old-school faggotitos.  Right.  They have the kind, I like a boy, and that's that.  They have.  And I stay inside my house in the closet with him, and we pinch helmets.  Okay.  Today, you got the ones that dress up like Sissy Mary's there.  Yeah.  With a dress and the other thing that they wear, you know, through the split of the cul-de-sac. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  To separate them.  Right.  And then you got the ones, you know, that just, uh, sicken me.  You're out of your mind.  Yeah.  Weird.  Like dinosaurs, I like them.  Old-school faggots.  The old-school ones.  The kind of faggot that said, I'm not a faggot.  I really do like girls.  Next thing you know, he's wearing mommy's bannies. 
[00:21:30]  Okay.  You know, today they come out, oh, I'm out of the closet.  You know what?  Get in.  You don't like them out of the closet?  No, it's not that.  I don't, you know, like, believe me, I could just drop pint after pint all day.  Of hot soup?  It's what I do.  Okay.  It's all I do.  You know what I mean?  That's what I get up for, to do that.  Yes, guys.  But, you know, I don't walk around all day going, you know, oh, bend over.  And do that. 
[00:22:00]  And then I do the other thing, and then, hot soup, hot soup.  You know what I mean?  Oh, you know.  Mr. President, hot soup, hot soup.  Mr. President, do you say call me too?  Do you say show me too?  Hot soup.  You know what I mean?  I don't do that.  Right.  I do it at the direct moment of impact.  That's how I work.  Are you having a nervous breakdown?  But no.  But these guys are out there going, I'm not afraid to say I like other men.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's not right.  It's not right.  It just doesn't work. 
[00:22:30]  All right.  Are you being dice cool right now?  No, I'm explaining a theory.  Oh, you're being dice.  I'm explaining a theory.  Like, I got no problem.  You're with a chick, right?  A theory.  You're with a chick.  Yeah.  And you want to explore the other half of her.  What do you mean?  The back half?  Yeah.  All right.  It's like, you know, the front is trying to mush because you pummel it constantly.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  You just pummel it.  It's an assault.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like, Todd, what do you weigh?  Because he's very, like.  I weigh about 85, about 97 pounds. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  So he's like, no, you're like 115, 120, right?  About a buck 20.  All right.  But then, picture a buck 20 just smacking into the center of you with everything you got.  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  So it's going to get splattered.  Right.  It's splattered.  So now what you do, you don't, like, force yourself on her.  You turn her over with her eyes all jacked up.  Yeah.  You take your dumb.  Your what?  You take your dumb.  Your dumb?  Your gum?  Your dumb. 
[00:23:30]  Your dumb.  Oh, like your fingers and your thumb.  And you dip, like.  You dip when you're dumb.  You dip a chip into sauce.  You know, like you're in the Italian restaurant.  Right.  You take a little bread.  You dip it.  You take your dumb.  Your dumb.  And you dip.  You did a dumb.  What is that?  What, what, does she like this?  No, but I'm saying, faggotitos do the same thing.  Yeah.  It's just wrong.  To dip.  Because you don't have that other crap down there.  That turns to mush.  That you can at least go, oh, it's really a chick. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like when you start feeling sick about taking your thumb and dipping it in the thing.  Yeah.  You see that, you know, all the hair, you know.  Right.  It's still a girl.  You know, the chuck steak, whatever they call it.  You're all right with it because you know she's a chick.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  But do you, does that mean, because I'm getting a little something from you that maybe when  you're dipping, you're feeling a little gay.  No.  Even if it's a girl.  No.  That you have to reassure yourself by looking that it's a girl.  No, because it's pushed on us so often. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Because I studied this.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  What school did you study at?  I'm old school.  I studied like old school style.  Back in the old days.  In the old days.  He's doing that look again here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm like, taking my thumb.  Yeah.  Dang.  Yeah.  And I'm like, gang, don't bring over here now.  And pummel.  And I says to her like that.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  And then she says, I'm all set.  I said, are you sure there?  And she says again, I'm all set.  Yeah.  And?  That's what I said.  Yeah.  That's what you said.  When you dip.  When you dip.  I got to come up with words on this show.  Well, dip is good.  You know what's funny?  I call in.  I hear the filthiest things ever on this show.  And I call in.  Yeah.  The minute I get in.  Oh, you can't say that.  You can't say this.  No.  You don't understand how to put it in terms that you can say these things. 
[00:25:30]  You can't say those things.  You don't understand how to put it in terms that you can say these things.  You know what I mean?  You can say anything.  You can say anything.  You can say anything as long as you put it in the right subject.  Unless it's like Star Blaster.  I like the movie.  Star Blaster?  Star Blaster.  Yeah, that big movie.  I know Brain Smasher.  Orange Clock.  We like the Brain Smasher.  No, I'm not talking about that.  Brain Smasher was good.  He doesn't want to talk about the movies out now.  We're talking about Brain Smasher.  That was good.  You were a cop in that, right?  Yeah, whatever.  Kind of renegade cop.  20 years ago. 
[00:26:00]  What are you talking about?  I like the movie.  I like the movie.  I joke you to death.  I like the movie.  Give me something to hit him with.  What?  No, that answer is right.  I smack you in the face with you.  I like it.  I'll just do it.  I don't even care.  We enjoyed the Brain Smasher.  But I'm not talking about that.  You just brought it up.  No, I said Brain Clock.  And I said Brain Smasher.  The same way they go faster than one guy.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Everything stops.  It's a kid's movie.  Time stopper.  Time stopper.  It stinks.  Who'd you play in that?  It stinks.  It's just like Back to the Future.  Who'd you play in that?  You should put it back in the can and tell the director to wipe his ass with it. 
[00:26:30]  That's how bad it was.  If I ever see him, I'm going to punch him in the face.  Make me spend the money.  Well, I wouldn't hit him.  One Night at McCall's was great.  I would just tell him, you know.  He was very good in that thing.  How do they say something's like something?  One Night at McCall's.  Every movie.  That was good.  Every movie in the world.  Wait a minute.  Every movie in the world.  When you go and buy it like a billboard or a poster.  You ever notice it?  Every movie's best movie of the year.  Right.  A must-see movie.  And they all stink.  Really?  Why don't they put one sign that says, you see this movie over here? 
[00:27:00]  They'd say like, it stinks.  It sucks.  Everybody would go see it.  It would be the biggest of the year.  This movie is garbage.  Don't check it out.  They put the good movie thing on.  Please, don't waste your money.  Shut up.  I'll come over there.  Don't throw things at me.  Really, I'm in a bad mood.  Hey, what happened to your cigarette?  Were you done with that one?  Now he flicks them at people.  Yeah.  He flicks it at me.  That's dangerous.  When they're lit, when they're not lit, what's going to happen?  Ouch.  Tobacco stink.  I'm going to have another one down.  Now he pulls out another one.  Cigarette. 
[00:27:30]  A net.  You get what I just did?  It's not an N.I.P.  That's right.  You see, I threw that in.  That was good.  A net.  That's right.  You do some Travolta.  All right.  I'm bored with it.  I did it already.  How long are you going to do it?  20 minutes?  I did a perfect impression.  Not even thinking about it.  I did one last.  Came out with it.  He did one last.  You know what I mean?  Threw it at you.  Thrilled you.  And then, and then, uh, stupefocation face over here.  Nah, nah.  Besides, now I'm going to do 10 more minutes of the same impression.  First of all, a net cigarette was double J, and you were doing, uh, Travolta. 
[00:28:00]  So you screwed it up.  It doesn't matter.  What do you mean screw it?  He didn't say in that cigarette.  What?  Am I paid to know who says what line?  He didn't say in that cigarette.  I do the line I want.  Didn't say it.  No, but I take the character.  Oh, so they do.  You're the perfect impression.  Of another guy that was doing it in the movie.  So say cigarette in that is double J.  No, I don't do that impression.  Well, what do you do?  You do that impression.  That's right.  I just do Travolta going, come on, I'm bored with you.  So I didn't say I'm doing Travolta.  That was double J.  No, it was.  It was not.  It just sounded a lot like Travolta. 
[00:28:30]  Don't you guys get it?  Not at all.  What other impressions, Dice?  What else do you do?  No, I'll do Travolta.  Okay.  Doing the same line.  Let's do it.  Cigarette, a net.  You're going to do it all day?  No, what I'm saying is, first I did double J.  You did it.  Doing a line, and I do Travolta doing a line.  But Travolta never did the line.  That's what I'm saying.  No, but he did it here.  Right now.  You're rewriting the script.  Well, what do I got to know it exact?  You know when people...  He's got a thousand lines that you could have done in the movie.  Donnie.  Donnie.  Don't talk, Donnie. 
[00:29:00]  You look like me.  You dress like me, Donnie.  It's what I do, Gail.  That's very good.  It's all I do, Gail.  You see what I did?  But I did me like Pacino doing me just now, I did.  Really?  Really happy?  What did you think of that?  It was wonderful, I'm sure.  I love everything you do.  Right, right, right.  Jason Rubito.  There's adoration there.  My new opening act.  I know, but he doesn't talk.  Because he's a little frail.  Does he do impressions?  Does he do any impressions? 
[00:29:30]  You do any impressions?  You do an impression.  What do you do?  Renta Fuego, Amo.  What?  You've got to hear it when he really does it.  What the hell is that?  Wow.  Did you hear that?  Was that Scarface?  Perfect.  Yeah?  Do it again.  Let's hear it a little.  Renta Fuego, Amo.  Yeah, that's not bad.  They're going to love him at Westbury.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Why do you think he's not talking?  Well, he's saving it up.  That's the goof.  When the King of the View didn't show up, Voss.  Yeah.  The King of the View. 
[00:30:00]  Remember that?  Yeah.  Remember how awful that was?  Opie.  You're the one that called me and said, did you see Voss?  I didn't see Voss.  No, it was terrible.  It was awful.  Well, you watched the View.  Do you know what?  He should have actually been fined from the Comics of America for going on a show and doing  that kind of thing.  I like to understand it.  It's from the Comics of America that I could find him.  Unless he just wanted to get that close to Joy's big boobs.  You know what I mean?  You watched the View?  I'll give it a little deej right on the...  You watched that too?  You like the View?  Yeah.  What's wrong with the View? 
[00:30:30]  It's for fags.  He was on the View.  What do you mean it's for fags?  It's for a house around.  I can't even understand being on it more than watching it.  I watch it every day.  Are you a house around?  It gets me angry.  You're ruining your image.  No, no.  Telling people you watch the View.  You don't understand.  How does it get you angry?  What angers you?  Because you watch shows today.  The fat one?  No, listen.  Forget about the fat.  Fat could always be changed.  Ugly is forever.  That's the way it works.  Like when you watch Sex and the City with them mutts, right? 
[00:31:00]  No boobs, no butts, but yet they're successful.  That can never happen for a woman.  You don't have a top or a bottom and you're making money?  It can never happen.  Now shows like Dwee's Company, remember that?  Right.  Suzanne Somers.  Suzanne Somers, big boobs.  Nice.  You saw the shorts, you know, splitting the thing there.  Right, the camel toe.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  You know, the front bumper.  The front bumper, for sure.  You saw that. 
[00:31:30]  She had the hair and pigtails always acting stupid.  Right.  You know, believable.  Shut your mouth.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  Oh, no.  Frenchie.  How are you doing?  It's Frenchie, Dice.  I want to say hello to the Jim Norton, the man of the show today.  Okay.  How are you doing, Jim?  You're the legend.  Oh.  It's a French Dice.  Hey, Dice, how are you doing?  You fat bastard. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, let me tell you something.  Why don't you shut your mouth, all right?  How are you doing?  Let me tell you something.  Why don't you shut your mouth and give him some respect?  Why don't you get off the phone and shut your face down here and put my boot in your throat?  You understand me?  Frenchie, you faggot.  Hey, you French people ever win a war?  You faggot.  You're a faggot.  You're a faggot.  You're a faggot.  Go live between your mother's ass.  That's where you belong.  You're a faggot.  You're a faggot.  You don't have a man.  I'm a legend.  He's a legend. 
[00:32:30]  He's a star.  He's playing the Beacon Theater Friday night.  He's playing Westbury.  Not you, you French faggot.  You're a faggot.  What do you do besides cook snails?  I'm going to have a good time.  What do you got to get off?  You faggot.  I want to talk to you later.  What do you got to get off?  The guy's just trying to say hello.  The guy's disrespect.  It's disrespectful.  What do you got?  What do you got?  I don't like him either, Andrew.  Well, that's what they do.  That's their little.  I saw him at Norton's show.  That's their fun.  Oh, you met the Frenchie at Norton's show. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, he wet his pants when he seen me.  Hey, Frenchie.  That's why he's a big shot on the phone.  What happened when you met Kenny?  Hey, Frenchie, what happened when you met Club Soda Kenny?  I actually like Frenchie.  I don't know.  He was a very nice guy, actually.  Yeah, you better say that.  Yeah, I'll kick your ass.  You better say that.  Is it true that you wet yourself when he came up to you?  Actually, I did the backdoor action there, you know.  It went all over my pens.  It's French dice.  I really don't see a problem with this guy.  It's French dice.  It's French dice.  Give us some more dice, Frenchie. 
[00:33:30]  Wait, I want to hear.  French dice.  I'm not going to do it all day.  How long is he going to do it for now?  You're not mad at me for doing cigarettes.  I remember dice.  But he could do this for two hours.  I didn't get mad how long you could do it.  I got mad because you didn't do the right character.  But what line do you need?  I don't know.  You've got to do this.  It's all the right.  Hey, I'm bored with it, all right?  I'm bored with it, all right?  Get rid of this guy.  I'm just bored with him.  All right, French dice.  I'm bored with him.  You know, I had my dance in 2001.  Right.  You know, and I thought maybe we could dance together.  You remember me, Tony Manel? 
[00:34:00]  We looked at, oh, I look at a guy and record him every second.  And he gets to who he's in the manger.  Oh, I know the type.  I know the type.  And I guess it starts with a C, Mr. B.  Go scratch your aids.  See, I'm perfect.  We're not trying.  You're perfect.  We're going to take a break.  We're not even trying.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNAW. 
[00:34:30]  I said to Dice, it looks like he lost some weight in it.  It looks like he's in shape.  And then he gets insulted.  And the next thing I know, he's...  I'm gorgeous.  How do you even say any of that?  He's ready to show me his...  I don't know.  What were you going to show us?  A little thing. 
[00:35:00]  All of a sudden, he's pulling his shirt up so we can get a closer look.  Well, Anthony was getting all excited.  I said, you're working out there, Dice.  He started feeling a little blood flow.  Oh, yeah, I was.  Not as much as when you played a Tony Schlongini in Wacko.  But, you know, because you looked good then.  Where are you pulling this stuff from?  Tony Schlongini.  I think I was 14 when I did Tony Schlongini.  Tell me he's lying.  No, that's the first movie ever.  Yeah.  Dice's first movie.  Oh, come on.  I'm a fan.  I know your career. 
[00:35:30]  Give us a line as Tony Schlongini.  All right.  You want a line as Tony Schlongini?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  You really want a line as Tony Schlongini?  Let's see a one.  Wait.  I got to think of Tony Schlongini.  It's not a Nets cigarette.  Hey, Rosie.  Remember that part?  No.  When I did that?  Not at all.  That was the beginning.  I come down the stairs.  Yeah.  And they sing, everyone's talking about him.  Yeah.  You've got to sing the song.  I don't know the song offhand. 
[00:36:00]  Tony Schlongini.  I haven't seen the movie in quite some time there, Dice.  And it wasn't one that stuck in my head.  Why not?  Why are you bringing it up?  Because I'm a fan of your career.  I kind of know one of the movies.  You know, there's a lot of people that love Tony Schlongini.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's the line then?  Give us a line.  When I say to the guy, you know, I'm going to punch you in the head or something like that.  And it sounded like Travolta?  Yes.  Because that was, he was Tony Schlongini.  Okay.  Right.  Which was a takeoff of Travolta.  Right.  He doesn't remember Tony Schlongini.  Like a takeoff of Tony Manero, kind of. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he goes, and what do you do?  You got a 2001 on your Friday night and you blow all your money, right?  Yeah, that's right.  What do you got?  Well, you got some Stairway to the Stars?  That's Tony Schlongini.  Oh, no.  It's Tony Manero.  Tony, it was written better.  Yeah?  No, it's Tony Schlongini.  There's a lot of lines.  So you didn't change any of the lines then?  No, no.  There were a lot of lines.  Between Tony Schlongini and Tony Manero.  Same script. 
[00:37:00]  It was just very similar.  But that's the same line.  No, no.  Dance of 2001?  No.  It just happened.  I don't know.  You have a doofy friend with big shoes that jumps off the Verrazano?  No.  That didn't happen in that movie?  No.  Yeah.  But what happened?  He goes, you see?  Now you're pig.  Oh, well, he didn't say pig in the Saturday Night V.  In the PG version, my friend.  It's pig.  And also in the Tony Schlongini version.  Because it was a PG movie.  Oh, yeah?  So they had to say pig. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  All right.  When she goes with double J.  Only it was triple J.  With all of them, yeah.  In the Tony Schlongini movie.  Oh, was it?  They go, you see that?  Now you're pig.  Did you have a priest brother that left the priesthood?  No, he was a father like.  He'll go back.  He'll go back.  Yeah.  No, he won't.  No, he won't.  Yes, he won't.  No, he won't.  Yes, he will.  No, he won't.  You see that?  Now you got two garbage kids.  Garbage, but he said piece of S.  No, that was in the R rating. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, the PG and Tony Schlongini?  That's right.  And Tony Schlongini said the same thing.  Don't touch the hair.  He always hits my hair and it hurts.  I noticed Club Soda Kenny's not laughing.  What's the matter, Kenny?  What's wrong, Kenny?  You heard this before.  You look bored.  Any comments about how terrific he was, like in Night Patrol or Casual Sex?  Believe me.  Casual Sex, of course.  He'll get to that.  He'll get to that.  He'll get to it, maybe.  Or maybe Anthony wants to do his terrific impression of Julia Child. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, what's wrong with Julia Child?  No, I love it.  I've been waiting to hear it.  We kind of enjoy the Julia Child.  But you're not smiling when Dice is performing.  I'm in awe.  What's wrong?  He's in awe.  Again.  Again.  Yeah, right.  Well, not Joe, why don't you say hi?  Hold on, Joe.  What about Anthony with the Tom Broken jaw?  That's a lot of fun, isn't it?  Mike.  It's not about us today.  It's about Dice.  It's about the legend.  They can, like, do dueling impressions.  That's not about us now today.  It's about Andrew.  I'm glad you realized that.  It's about Dice. 
[00:39:00]  Joe, what's up?  It's not about you, Kenny.  Hey, Dice.  Dice?  Balloon, not Joe.  Dice?  Dice, Dice, baby.  Is Dice there?  Hey, hold on.  All right, I'm all set.  Hey, Dice, are you feeling all right?  Because your voice sounds different.  Yeah, I'm all set.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  It's a little screwy.  I got to take something to say that.  You going to be all right for the shows?  No, I should be all right.  Wait a minute.  Need some tea with honey?  Yeah, a little tea. 
[00:39:30]  A little tea.  Donnie.  Let me test it.  Donnie.  It'll work.  Yeah, it'll work, right?  I want to hear more star face from your guy over there.  Oh, the opener?  Yeah.  Jason.  Jason Rabito.  He seems more relaxed now.  Yeah, I'm all right now.  He might be ready to talk.  What happened?  What are you doing tonight?  Yeah.  At least you got somebody that is a lot like Voss to open for you.  They'll loosen up.  Look, they just found a new target in you.  That's all right.  You're fine. 
[00:40:00]  Don't ever let them hurt you.  And what's wrong?  He's no Dice as Kurt in Private Resort.  You know, that got me going.  How do you know that?  Why?  I don't care that you know Private...  How do you know the character?  I didn't even remember.  Kurt.  Kurt.  That's a great character.  I don't remember.  He's got a lot of personality in that.  You don't remember being Kurt?  Why would I remember him?  Give me a line from Kurt.  All right.  Let me do Kurt for you.  All right.  This is Kurt.  Here's Kurt. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Because that was with Johnny Depp, if you remember.  Oh, big star.  Okay.  So I come over to him and I say like this.  You know how all those girls are down in 2001?  I'm with my girl.  Maybe you let me use your room, eh?  No way.  That's Kurt.  It sounds like Tony Schlongini.  No, but it was a takeoff.  Doing Tony...  So I got hired.  Yeah.  No, I got hired.  Yeah.  Because they saw what I did at Schlongini.  Your work at Schlongini.  So they expected...  Right.  ...like the same persona. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  That's why they hired you.  Like when Travolta went from fever to Greece.  It's pretty much the same guy.  They just put him back in time.  So now I'm stuck in this persona.  Yeah.  You broke out of that though later on.  And then I had a fight with Hector Alizazando.  Yeah.  And I says like this to him.  Donnie.  Now that don't sound like Kurt.  No, no, no, no, no.  He says to me.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, no.  He called me Kurt.  Kurt.  Doesn't that sound like him?  Yeah, just like it.  Kurt.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Do you know what I did to that, Kurt?  No, I don't know.  You don't have no idea, my friend.  You got to explain it to me because, you know, because I'm here with my partner.  Yeah.  You know, and then Johnny Depp walks in and goes, I can't let you use my room.  Is that Sylvester Stallone?  No.  Why does he sound like Johnny Depp?  Because at that time, Depp had more of a character going like a Rocky Balboa. 
[00:42:00]  I don't understand.  No.  You know what I mean?  I don't remember that phase.  What do you mean you don't remember?  I don't remember that Johnny Depp phase of being like sly.  When it was all bulked up, before he shredded, before he did Jump Street.  Before Jump Street?  And he was playing all those parts, you know, like that Stallone type of thing.  I completely don't know.  You know, I got to go with that girl.  You know, you shouldn't.  This is Johnny Depp.  Yeah.  It's exactly the exact line.  All right.  I'm going to go, no, you got to get out of the room and give me one of them condominiums. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  You know, so I could go with the girl.  But he's not saying right in between.  Yeah.  And then he jumps off the Verrazano Bridge wearing the big platform shoes.  Why didn't you call me, Tony?  There was no bridge in the movie.  Tony, you didn't call me.  Bobby, Bobby.  Bobby.  Come off the bridge.  You're making me very nervous, Bobby.  Look, Tony.  I'm dancing.  Look, Tony.  Look at me, Tony.  Look at me.  Look at me, Tony.  Bobby, come in the car.  Bobby, come in the car. 
[00:43:00]  Tony, look at me.  Who did you talk about, Bobby?  Look at me, Tony.  Bobby, Bobby.  You didn't call me.  Why would you learn that?  Why would you even bother to learn that?  I've seen the movie.  You've seen it a few times.  You know, I had a car accident with that guy.  Did you?  No way.  The guy with the platform shoes?  That dummy.  Did he come out?  Why did you hit me, Dice?  Why did you hit me?  You know, I actually stopped my car because I saw he was on the wrong side of the street. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  I didn't know it was him.  Right.  I just saw somebody coming out.  So I actually stopped and this moron kept going and just bashed in the front of a Trans-Am I had.  Yeah.  And he gets out of the car and I see who it is.  I go, Bobby.  And I went home.  I actually went home, got my video camera because the cars are screwed up anyway.  Yeah.  And we like, we did it.  We did it?  And made like a movie out of it. 
[00:44:00]  And he came back?  No, I didn't let him leave.  Oh.  Wait, you had to leave to get your camera then you came back.  I looked around the corner.  I had to go get the video camera.  And he waited.  Yeah.  Well, where's he going?  The car's destroyed.  Where was this, Brooklyn?  No.  It was out in L.A.  Oh.  So then I called this guy up.  I go, you got to take care of the damage.  And he's telling me, I got no money.  I was actually on my way to Palm Springs to pick up the car.  I had a car, his real car.  That was a rented car.  See, that part of the story, I don't care now. 
[00:44:30]  No, but I'm just saying, I got a whole movie with Bobby.  Oh, okay.  I want to see that.  I mean, that's a feature film, basically.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Bobby and Dice.  Bobby and Dice.  Yeah.  I go, Bobby, come on.  Come out of the car and talk to me, Bobby.  But why did you learn that impression?  I did just, I've always thought it was funny.  Do it again.  It was funny.  Oh, you're not getting me like that.  Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Ah, nah, nah.  You just want to see.  No.  I did it already.  That's it.  And that's what he does.  He does it once.  Do a different scene.  No.  Look at your video you made with him and that's it.

Oh, buddy  It's been a long, long time  We are live  For the first time in almost two weeks  Yeah, it's been a while  What day is it?  Because when I was listening to The Best Of 
[00:49:00]  We were saying we were live and stuff  But we weren't  It was a tape  Oh, was it a tape?  Some of them we go, hey, we're live here  And it was an old tape  I think it's August  Alright, well, hey, what's up, man?  A lot of people bitching and complaining  Because we took a little summer vacation  I'm sorry  Know what they were pissed at?  I don't understand  Know what they were pissed at?  What?  The faithful listeners  I mean, there's a lot of people listening to us  Right now  They could give a flying F  They listen to us, what, five, ten minutes a day?  Yeah  But I'm talking about those hardcore fans 
[00:49:30]  Right  They're pissed at us  Because we didn't tell them  We were taking a vacation  Yeah, they get mad at that  That's what they're mad at  When we just leave  You guys  How dare you guys go on vacation  And not tell us before you go  I remember the Friday  What are we going out with our audience?  The Friday we left  To go on vacation  Yeah  The last spot of the day  It was Friday  I guess it was about 6.45  Something like that  We're ready to leave  And I mentioned vacation  During one of the live reads  That only New York heard 
[00:50:00]  Yeah  And I got done  And you said to me  Don't tell them  Don't tell them  I was like  I was like what  Well  What?  Don't  Don't tell them  I did say that  Because I got a philosophy about that  It's a philosophy, Marty  I like tricking the audience  Into thinking we're still here  You tricked them  And then by the time they realize  That we're on vacation  We're almost back  We're almost back  And they're thinking  Oh, the boys took two or three days off  They took a long weekend  You don't think anybody knows 
[00:50:30]  That we took like a week and a half off  Let me tell you something  Over 5,000 pieces of email  Were waiting for us  When we got back  Of course  And it worked like a charm  Did it?  Because most people started realizing  That we're on vacation  About Wednesday of last week  Yeah  Really?  Yeah  So the first few days  We tricked them  One guy even writes  Not me  I was stupid  One guy even writes  Hey, you guys were live  Monday and Tuesday  But where'd you go?  You're not on the air anymore 
[00:51:00]  Oh  You're in best of mode  So  Oh, well  Well, we are back  And it's great  It's great to be back  In the good old United States of America  I'll tell you that  You didn't go overseas  Because  What?

You go home  Hi, Maria  Thank you  Meanwhile  Above 110th Street  It sounds like you had a good vacation  I had such a diverse vacation  I took six aircraft  To the various locations that I went to 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, hanging out on the beach  At one point  And earlier in my vacation  I was rainbow trout fishing  In the Colorado mountains  That's quite  It was great  That's quite a contrast  From Miami  And my hiking gear  That I just knew bought  I didn't have hiking gear  So we had to go to the store  Buy some hiking gear  So you could get from the car to the lake  And fishing poles  And I went to the lake  And beautiful Colorado mountains 
[01:00:30]  All around you  Did you have a fishing hat  With all your lures hanging off it  I had a  What was my hat?  What is it?  It was kind of a cross between  On Golden Pond  And the Crocodile Hunter  It was kind of like a combination of those two  And yeah  I had my boots on  And I was casting out there into the lake  And the rainbow trout  Just jumping like crazy  You know what?  What?  Stop it! 
[01:01:00]  That sounds like a Robert Redford movie  It was amazing  A river run throughs it  You know something?  Hold on  A river run throughs it  A river run throughs it  Shut up!  I'm still on vacation  A river runs through it  A river run throughs it  Hey here's the star of the show  Put an S wherever you feel is necessary  A river runs throughs it  Oh yes  You can't get the whole gist 
[01:01:30]  Of being out in the middle of the mountains there  You're in Colorado  Beautiful lake  And with the fish are jumping  They were jumping right out of the lake  You just cast your line in there  You feel the little bite  Now you're fighting the fella  And you're bringing him onto the shoreline there  Did you get Walter?  Clock him against the head  You know I don't think we're  I don't think we're meant to go on vacation ever  Why?  Because I don't think we know how to vacation  I try to do a lot of everything 
[01:02:00]  You're like rainbow trout fishing  I was rainbow trout fishing  And then I was smelling fish  Walking down Ocean Drive  Were you tapping  Were you tapping the Rockies?  I tapped the Rockies  That's all I needed  I had various beers in my cooler  Which I'll tell you  Just in case one of the sponsors  Caught you on vacation  Caught me on vacation  There was a Bud Light representative  And he snapped a picture  You're drinking a Sam  He was in the Rockies?  What happened there?  I had a big heavy cooler 
[01:02:30]  That I had to bring down  And you know  I'm not much of an outdoorsman  Not much of an outdoorsman  And I  Why do they call it rainbow trout?  Because they look like  They got rainbows on them  No don't they kind of  Jump out of the water  In a rainbow fashion?  I don't know  I saw them  They all jumped out like that  They kind of  You know  Or is it because they're gay  And form a coalition?  The rainbow coalition trout  Yes  You put a little bait on there  It's like a little wiener  And you throw it in  They're just hobbing it 
[01:03:00]  As you're reeling it in  Coming out with it in their  Little fish back door  It was great  I never do stuff like that  I don't go fishing  And it's a lot different  Than maybe going to  Long Island Sound  Or the South Shore  And trying to fish there  When you're in the middle  Of the mountains  What's wrong with blue fishing?  It's kind of cool  But I wouldn't do  Something like that  If someone here told me  You want to go fishing  I'd be like  Where am I going fishing?  I'm going to look at  The Lilco Energy Towers  And cast my line 
[01:03:30]  It was nice  It was the whole scene  The mountains were beautiful  The lake amazing  It was a beautiful scene  And the fishing was part of it  It was kind of cool  Because I haven't been fishing  Since I was a kid  And had a great time  As sun started setting  I heard this  I'm like  What the hell  Steamship going by?  What is that?  What is that?  Steamship?  No  Ocean liner?  No  On a lake 
[01:04:00]  No  It was bugs  That's how they found?  Bugs  Bugs  They were all in the tree lines  Surrounding the lake  And as the sun went down  They started going toward the lake  So they were all over the place  More bugs than you can believe  And I had to carry my cooler through them  Yeah  Picture that  A million times  And non-stop  And I'm spraying off  All over myself  I'm like the city  The city guy  Just spraying myself  And running through the bugs  And then I had to climb this 
[01:04:30]  This steep incline  With the cooler  And I'm just like  I was a mess  You were running from the giant mosquito  I was running from the giant encephalitis mosquito  I swear to you  It was there  Someone wants to know  Someone wants to know  Ed, you sure you didn't just play EverQuest for two weeks?  Oh right  I was  Yeah, yeah 
[01:05:00]  That's it  I was just in different sections of the game  No  I went on vacation  And Ed  Tony wants to know  If you tried the Rocky Mountain oysters  Or the Miami Beach oysters  No  No  And it wasn't fishing for trouser trout  Everyone's got their little  Everyone's got their little jokes  The trouser  Don't they  You funny people  The trouser trouts were in Miami  Hey Anthony  Was it the trouser trout  Hey look  I caught a black one  It was a great time 
[01:05:30]  Cool  A lot of aircraft though  Open  Had to take a lot of aircraft  You got to take a plane into Denver  I give kudos  To the Denver airport  Lots to do  Great airport  They say it's an amazing airport  They got restaurants  Shops  Things to do  Places to drink  It's like a mall in there right?  Big smoking lounge  Upstairs  Very nice  Miami International Airport  Is the dregs 
[01:06:00]  Of airports  The worst  Just horrific  The security was awful  They didn't know what  One guy didn't know what the other guy was doing  And nothing to do  So I go  Oh  I see the little sign that has the universal sign of the cocktail  You know the martini glass with the olive in it  And I'm like  I'm going to go shake my bonbon  Down at the bar  Here at Miami International Airport  So I'm walking through the loud hallways 
[01:06:30]  Underneath your window  I see a silhouette  No bar  No bar  They had a  A cart  Set up  A cart  Where you're supposed to get your drinks  This fat  Believe it or not  Spanish woman  Was there going  It's not open for another 45 minutes  Maybe 45 minutes  So I'm like  Okay I got plenty of time  I go  Now to the gate  That we're supposed to be at  And I figure we'll sit there 
[01:07:00]  I'll wait  Then I'll go back  And get my drink from the drink cart  Good good  And then go back to the gate area  They sequester you in the gate area  In Miami by the way  You know how once you pass security  You're in that safe zone of the terminal  No  They sequester you in  The gate area  So if you're at gate 12  You have to stay in gate 12  You stay there  If you want to leave  To go to the bathroom  Or get a drink off the drink cart  You have to  Show them the boarding pass  He puts  I got to put a mark on this  Then when you come back 
[01:07:30]  I see the mark  You have to be search  You have to be search  So I'm like  Okay I'll be search  So I go to get the drink  Now I go to the drink cart  The woman at the lousy  Miami International Airport goes  Maybe one  Maybe two o'clock now  Maybe  Thank you son of the bitches  It's an airport  Forget it  I'll go back  When I go back now  I'm supposed to present my boarding pass  With the little mark that he made  And get search  There's another person there  A woman now  She looks 
[01:08:00]  She goes  Let me see your ID  So I show her the ID  I show her the ticket  She doesn't notice that he put the mark on it  Let's me right back in again  Let's me right back in  You could have been smuggling some of that breast milk  I could have  Right  Some of the Kennedy Airport breast milk  That we'll get into in a little while here  I  None of them knew what they were doing  Once you cross that initial security thing  Where you are x-rayed  And everything  You're supposed to be in a secure area  That includes the gates  The terminal  Where you can move freely about that area 
[01:08:30]  Everything that goes in that area is checked  So why the hell  When I'm leaving the gate  Do they have to check things off  They were all half-assed  There was nothing to do but sit there  Especially in these days  Where security is crazy  And it takes a long time  You gotta have some goddamn attractions at that airport  Denver was great  And then we took this little prop job  Over the Rocky Mountains  I know you  Into Grand Junction  You don't really enjoy flying  Dude I have totally changed my take on flying  I'm a good fly 
[01:09:00]  I will never fly again  I enjoy flying  I will not be flying anytime soon  I'm fascinated by the idea  That you take machinery full of people  Hurl it through the cosmos  And end up somewhere else  In a matter of hours  It amazes me  I dig it  Did you have the slowdown in mid-air again?  Yeah that's what they do  I don't like that  You gotta pull back  I listen on the radio  I listen to the air traffic controllers  And the pilots on Channel 9  You put it on the headphones  And you hear them  And he tells you  What the call sign for your plane's gonna be  Good night at 5079 
[01:09:30]  Clear  I'll hold short of the runway  And then you turn  Make the turn  You take off  And you hear what they're doing  He's like  I'd like to deviate 15 degrees left  For weather  Oh he's deviating  Because there's a huge cloud here  And he deviates  That would make me feel better  I think  If I could hear those guys  Just tells you everything that's going on  It's great  It was  It was a little bumpy  Oh those mountains  And that little  It's just a prop plane 
[01:10:00]  So  And you're being bounced  Up and down  And side to side  And it's a fun ride  When you've got some cocktails in you  And that Denver airport  Has some cocktails  Not like Miami  They know how to cocktail  They can cocktail  Even Little Grand Junction  Had a bar  In their airport  Little area  You could grab a beverage  Miami though  Awesome  And then we had a stop in Washington  From the way to Miami  To New York  You liked Miami  You just didn't like the airport 
[01:10:30]  I love Miami  It was great  We had a great time  Cool  Like I said  If you're a guy  You're looking for hot chicks  You're stupid to go  I see homeless people down in Miami  There's homeless people  And I think  How stupid are the New York homeless  Of course  I sell your cans  Your bottles  Whatever you're selling  To get enough money  To work your way to Miami  Because the homeless down there  They're laying on the beach  They're going in the water  They got their shirts  Tied around their waist  They're hanging with people  And  Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang 
[01:11:00]  Here's their soundtrack  And they're walking down the streets  Full of babes  And they're homeless  But they're in Miami  The weather's nice  We have the stupidest homeless  In the country here  They're asinine homeless  But there's also the danger  On your way down  You'll die on the back of the bus  I wet myself  Just took a little rest  That wasn't on the schedule  Oh, Joe  You're a wonderful person  You're like  Tracer  That's the place to be homeless, though 
[01:11:30]  Well, let's break  Roy  I feel bad  I didn't have an adventurous vacation  Like you, Ant  I had a good time  But, you know  No real highlights  No  Not really  Why don't we take a break, Anthony  Really?  Wow, the phones have exploded  Everyone wants to wish us  Hey, look at that  So we're going to take our first break  And we're going to figure this out next  Stay there  103, go to chair  23 Skadoo  It's time 
[01:12:00]  For  Staple Gun Roulette  On the O.B. and Anthony show  Rick, I'm going to do a service  For our listeners  Could you move the pocketbook  Because it's interfering with the  the awesome cam.  Yeah, we got Melissa Ann and Alexis  somebody in here.  What's your, what Winston?  Oh, Winston, that's right. 
[01:12:30]  I'm educating him today.  Winston.  That's good.  Okay, and they're going to help us,  no, they're going to do the whole  goddamn thing.  They're not helping us, they're doing it.  We're going to invite these ten guys  in, Anthony.  They are going to line up  one of them will step forward  at a time and they will  pick a staple gun.  There's ten of them on the counter  and they will hand 
[01:13:00]  the staple gun over to Melissa Ann or  Alexis Winston and then  they will pull  the trigger and if they  get nailed by a staple  they're out of the competition.  Out of the building.  Now, out of the ten staple guns on the counter  only one is loaded.  Only one is loaded.  Not yet.  Oh, not yet?  Do we get gloves?  Do we get plastic gloves?  Stinky, I'm sure we have gloves around  that we used to have  for a certain thing  we can't do anymore. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, nice.  Oh, yeah, we got an emergency guy.  They got gloves.  Yeah, oh, you like that.  Don't even go there.  Put your gloves on, ladies,  because we're about to start  the competition.  Don't even go there.  That uniform puts three extra inches  on any guy.  We'll autograph these  and then give them to you afterwards.  You can sell them on eBay.  After a pelvic exam?  Yeah, the staple gun.  Open Anthony glove.  We should be able to get  at least 69 cents  per glove.  Anthony, explain again  because now we're all over  the ball field here. 
[01:14:00]  This is Russian roulette  with staplers.  With staple guns.  And one of those ten staplers  will be loaded with staples.  The other nine will be empty.  Yes.  One of the gentlemen will come in.  He will point to a stapler  that he wants to be used.  You will pick it up.  He will then  pull down his pants.  You will place the staple gun  firmly against one of his  buttock cheeks  and squeeze away.  Where?  He will either...  Well, wherever it's at its meatiest. 
[01:14:30]  Just get the meaty area.  The meaty area.  The meaty area.  We don't want it going into  a hip bone or anything.  It has like a really hairy buttock.  Well, these are things  I don't even want to know about.  You just squeeze away.  Let it go.  If you hear him scream in pain,  you know that is the one  with the staple in it.  He is then out.  Out.  And then the staple guns  get mixed up again.  Replaced and we start over. 
[01:15:00]  And if Smokey wins...  Next guy comes in.  Smokey wins.  That's the end of your relationship  with WWE.  I'll tell you that.  The fact that we're in there.  That'll be the end of any promos.  Let's get the guys in.  All right.  And as the guys...  Oh, wait.  First, we're loading the staple gun.  Do it on the mic there, Rick.  Where is Rick?  Here we go.  Get the staple in there.  One staple gun.  Loading.  There it is.  Put the clip in.  One staple gun out of the ten  is now loaded.  These are like real staple guns.  Oh, this is hardcore. 
[01:15:30]  They have little teeth on the end.  And they're brand new.  Oh.  Okay.  It's loaded.  Ready to go, Anthony.  And they're brand new staple guns,  so the springs are very good.  They are very good.  Now, let's...  Rick, be conscious all the time  that they cannot tell which one.  Right.  They don't pick up the stapler themselves.  They just point at it.  And we pick it up.  One of the lovely young ladies  pick it up.  And he's just got to stand there.  Make sure the mics are in the right areas.  We need one on the stapler, 
[01:16:00]  one on his face.  And we'll alternate.  Well, Lewis,  unless you say these things,  you know,  I don't want to miss out  on that quick scream thing.  I understand.  It's what I live for.  Think you'll help out with the mic?  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we get the guys in here?  It's time to do the  staple gun roulette thing.  Here we go.  All right.  Are we doing this?  Oh, there he is.  Guys, if you could line up  against the CD wall.  Against the back wall.  No pilfering, please.  There they go. 
[01:16:30]  Here's a little smoky.  Now, guys,  I'm going to say this once,  and please listen up.  Please.  No cursing.  You're really...  I know all of you  are little potty mouths.  And when you're talking,  just try to be conscious of  the S, F, T, C,  all those fun words  that are so much fun to say,  yet we can't do them.  It'll just make the show...  I cannot believe you.  Lewis, f*** off. 
[01:17:00]  I had to tell Lewis to f*** off.  That is an example  of something that cannot be said.  Anthony just cursed out Lewis Black.  Very nice.  And guys,  please do not grope the lady.  Okay?  No groping of the penthouse pets.  Yes, yes.  Now,  I guess we've got to know  a little bit about everybody.  We've already spoken to you, Smokey.  No, no, let's...  I want to talk to Smokey again.  All right, Opie.  Maybe ask him where he's from or something.  Yeah, Smokey,  where are you from?  Smokey,  I'm from Philly.  Oh, Philly, Reverend. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, thank you, Philly.  Philly is so happy right now.  Thank you, Philly.  The entire city of Philadelphia  just went,  oh, Jesus.  Once again,  Philly,  represent you.  Yeah, Philly,  we got one of yours  right here in the studio.  That's right.  At that time,  you sent those beautiful strippers  from Philly.  Shut up, Smokey.  I'm talking.  Now, Smokey.  Smokey?  Smokey?  Yeah, over here.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  And what do you do in Philly?  College professor?  What do you do in Philly? 
[01:18:00]  I actually have a traveling job,  so I only live in Philly on the weekends.  What do you do for a living?  I go from Maine, Virginia,  so I live in Philly for two days.  What do you do, though,  for money?  What do you do?  What's your occupation,  your line of work?  I don't know for your job.  Well, all right, sir.  What I do for money is  during the week.  During the week.  I go to Home Depot  from Maine to Virginia,  and I do it ourselves  before they open the store, 
[01:18:30]  so it'll be nice and pretty.  Home Depot?  Yes.  All right.  Don't pull me away.  Thank you.  Smokey, were you in a car accident  when you were younger?  I got you.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Smokey.  No problem.  All right, why don't we...  It's like Adam Carolla's  retarded little brother.  Doesn't he?  A little bit.  Wow.  All right.  Hey, are we taking digital pictures, too?  Okay, why don't...  Well, let's have Smokey 
[01:19:00]  step up to the staple guns  and pick one.  Go for it.  Smokey, if you would just...  Now, just point to one.  All right.  All right.  Just point to one.  Now, Smokey...  And don't eat it.  Here it goes.  I love that.  Look at Lewis.  Look at Lewis's face.  Hey, Rick.  She's kind of showing everyone else.  Yeah, keep the gun down.  There you go.  Yeah, keep the gun facing down.  Okay.  Do I do now, or what?  Yeah, Smokey.  Yeah, Smokey.  Why don't you...  Yeah.  Smokey, if you would pull down your pants... 
[01:19:30]  And you'll know his has the staple  if you hear, uh, and it goes,  pfft, all over.  I can't figure out how to say that.  How do you say, make a...  Oh, pfft.  Yeah, I understand.  That's all that's important, Jimmy.  All right.  Truman Capote, hurry up.  We got a show to do here.  All right.  Rick is having...  Rick, what's the problem?  He's getting too close to me.  Oh, okay.  Now...  How you doing?  Smokey, you will talk into that, Mike,  and, uh, Stinky, get around the stapler end. 
[01:20:00]  Pull your pants down.  All right.  All right.  What's the problem?  Hold on.  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What's the problem over there?  Wait, wait.  Don't feel me here.  Hold on.  Rick.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick,  Wait, Stinky.  My ass is showing out.  Wait a minute.  Wait, Stinky, talk to Melissa.  What's wrong with his, uh, backside there?  Um, he's flexing.  Yeah.  No, there's no problem with my ass.  Just relax.  It'll go easier.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Rick, Rick, you got to pay attention to this for a second.  Make sure the ladies don't just, in the middle of us talking, smack it. 
[01:20:30]  This is very, it's got to be quiet.  We got to tell you exactly when to do this so we don't miss any of the sounds.  Now, all right, his pants are down.  If there's a staple in this staple gun, we're all going to know, obviously,  and then, uh, Smokey will be out of the competition.  Yeah.  Smokey, would you be more comfortable if there was an uncle or camp counselor behind you?  Yeah.  And, uh, guys, by the way, how hot is Melissa?  Oh, I thought you were going to say Smokey. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  All right, I guess we're ready.  Everyone be quiet in the room.  All right, we're ready.  Everyone be very quiet.  Let's listen in as the stapler clicks.  I don't know.  Let's find some way.  All right.  Yeah.  No, there was not a stapler in that one.  Yeah.  All right.  Lucky break for us.  Smokey makes it to the next round.  Put that one away.  Yeah, that's great.  All right, Smokey, you can sit, you can stand over here.  We've got to separate the guys and make it to the next round.  A jelly roll.  Actually, Smokey, maybe wait out, no, wait over there? 
[01:21:30]  Okay.  Earl, just make sure, yeah.  Okay, who's up next?  Timmy.  Hey, Timmy, where are you from?  Staten Island.  Staten Island, representing.  Staten Island.  You belong in the dump of Staten Island.  Exactly, from New York City over here.  Let's do it.  All right.  And we've got our EMTs standing by.  Of course, just in case of any problems.  Now, what do you do for a living?  We're from the flight department, Bureau of EMS.  There you go, okay.  All right.  All right, I guess we're ready.  We are ready.  He's pulling down his pants.  And now here's the beautiful Alexis Winston. 
[01:22:00]  Alexis Winston, what's wrong with his ass?  It's a little hairy.  Yeah.  He's all man.  It's a little hairy, but it's fine.  All right.  Now, if everybody be quiet as the stapler hits ass.  Oh, God, okay.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no faking it.  No faking that old gag.  We don't need the faking.  Goddamn smoke.  You're ripping off Smokey's bits.  All right.  Tim makes it to the next round, Anthony. 
[01:22:30]  Tim makes it.  All right.  Who's up next?  Corman.  Corman, where are you from?  Point Pleasant, New Jersey.  All right, right.  All right, Jersey.  All right.  You want to pick a staple gun there?  And what's your line of work, my friend?  I work in retail.  A little retail worker there.  All right.  Well, pull down those pants.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  I can't tell another guy to pull his pants down.  It certainly is.  All right.  Here's Melissa.  Just direct him.  Carmen has picked out a staple gun.  If there's a staple in it, we'll all know, and he'll be out of the competition. 
[01:23:00]  There you go.  All right.  All right, guys.  Here we go.  A nice little round one here.  All right.  A nice little round one.  Make sure we go.  Okay, good.  Here we go.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Oh, he made it.  He makes it.  You can see the faces these guys make.  The anticipation is amazing.  He's killing these guys.  Now we're getting down to it, guys.  You know, that's three staplers that are taken out of the mix.  You're right.  Okay.  Who's up next?  All right.  My name's Andrew.  I'm from Queens. 
[01:23:30]  All right, Andrew.  Representing Queens.  What do you do?  I work concessions at Shea Stadium.  There you go.  Let's go next.  All right.  All right.  Alexis Winston.  He has picked a stapler.  Alexis Winston has it in her hand.  Her beautiful hand.  Andrew is dropping his pants.  He's dropping trowel there.  And if we could have quiet again.  What's wrong with this one?  What's wrong with his ass?  Oh, my God.  It's fabulous.  It looks great.  Let me tell you.  There you go.  All right.  She's not as much back than any other part of him. 
[01:24:00]  As she places the stapler against her, let's all listen in.  Wow.  Nothing.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, you were freaking out.  What a sigh of relief.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's the best part of this.  What a sigh of relief that came out of him.  Oh, thank God.  All right.  Who's next?  Hey, Mike.  Where are you from?  Staten Island?  Staten Island.  Another Staten Island guy.  Okay.  Pick a staple gun.  Point.  Wow. 
[01:24:30]  There's not many staple guns left on the calendar.  We are on the fifth one out of 10.  Out of 10.  Oh, my God.  His pants are down.  Melissa Ann has the staple gun.  Melissa Ann, put it up against there.  And let's listen.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  That was another empty staple gun.  These guys are so freaked out.  I love it.  We are now past the 50-50 mark. 
[01:25:00]  There are five staplers remaining, four of which are empty, one of which is really going  to sting.  All right, John.  John, what do you do, man?  I work for the government, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, kid.  Oh, all right.  Like old dirty works for the government.  He gets the checks.  And where are you from?  Long Island.  All right.  Representing Long Island.  Out of Long Island.  Okay.  Point to a stapler.  There you go.  Alexis Winston has the staple gun in her hand.  Put a hell of a build on it. 
[01:25:30]  And he is...  If you hated hairy asses, you're going to hate this one.  I just don't want you to, like, you know, blow on me.  Just do it.  All right.  She is putting the staple.  Let's all listen in.  Can you bend it very nicely?  There we go.  Be quiet.  Give it to me, baby.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He was oblivious.  Oh, no.  Look at the guys that still have to go.  They are freaking out now. 
[01:26:00]  Did you notice?  He was oblivious.  Yeah.  He didn't care.  These guys are freaking out.  Four staplers left.  Johnny Bray.  Three of those staplers are empty.  All right.  I know I am.  He has picked it.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Where are you from, Johnny?  North Plainfield.  There you go.  Another New Jersey represent.  Yeah, I'm going down a little more.  It's not fair.  There you go.  Okay.  The hot Melissa Ann with the staple gun in hand, Anthony.  Oh, my.  Let's listen. 
[01:26:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He makes it through the round.  What?  Oh, my God.  He didn't even know?  You didn't even know?  How fat are you?  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  How many mules did it take to deaden those sensations?  Oh, my God.  You didn't feel anything?  I didn't feel a thing at all. 
[01:27:00]  Girls, check his ass.  Dude, I'm telling you.  They barely even feel.  Now I feel it a little bit, but you don't feel it.  Maybe the girls didn't press hard enough or something.  Are you girls pressing?  Yeah.  That thing was stuck in there.  That thing was totally stuck in there.  It was stuck in there.  He had to pick it out with his nails.  Well, he is a big guy.  That's because it's an anthem steal.  Yeah.  Well, he's a big guy.  All right.  You're out, bro.  Johnny's out.  Sorry, man.  Let's hear it for Johnny.  Let's go.  Now, Opie. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  The way this has to work, though, is the three remaining.  We'll start off.  We start off now with nine staplers.  Right.  Yeah.  And you three now have to go because it would be unfair if you guys, you know.  Yeah.  Remember the order, but we start with those three, and then we go back to the front of the line  again, okay?  You got the order there?  Good.  All right.  Let's get another round in before we take a break.  Let's mix those up.  I can't believe that fat ass didn't feel that.  You know prison doesn't frighten them.  Give me a break.  Wow.  Nothing.  Rick is working, mixing up the staplers. 
[01:28:00]  We're down to nine staple guns on the counter.  And it doesn't sound different.  Rick, make sure the girls are definitely pressing.  Yeah.  All right.  And where is it being put?  In the cheek or the side?  Right in the...  Maybe we should go a little higher.  Yeah.  Maybe it's too fat back.  Yeah.  All right.  They're going to go a little higher.  Just a little.  Maybe in the vein underneath.  Just make sure it is far to the right or left. 
[01:28:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just up a little and to the right or left.  All right.  When we go on to the second round, who's up next?  What's up, guys?  Pat.  Where are you from, Pat?  Staten Island.  Another Staten Island guy.  Look at this.  A lot of Staten Island, man.  What do you do, man?  I work in a parking enforcement at a college campus.  All right.  And pick a stapler.  He picked out a staple gun, Anthony.  Alexis Winston has a staple gun.  Yeah.  You got to put your...  Pull him down.  Don't be shy, Pat. 
[01:29:00]  Pull him down.  He's taking his pants down.  Right.  The...  Where have you been, dude?  What's going on with your butt?  What's wrong with his butt?  I'm working outdoors a lot, you know?  I'm working outdoors a lot.  What's wrong with it?  It's...  It's...  It's nicely rounded, but it's very, like, red pimply.  Like, he's been...  Jesus.  You're working out quick.  Degrade the guy?  What do you work outdoors as a driveway scraper?  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:29:30]  Nothing.  Nothing.  You skate.  You skate.  He makes it on to the next round, Anthony.  Who's up next?  Sean?  Yeah.  Where are you from?  Jersey.  Jersey.  Another guy from Jersey representing there.  Here we go.  He's picking out a staple gun off the counter.  He is preparing himself for the staple.  Put your shirt up.  Listen.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.

Yeah, we've got to work...  We've got to move over this factor. 
[01:30:30]  Let's listen.  Nah.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Well, he looked like he's oblivious, too.  Okay.  We're back to Smokey.  Smokey.  Back to the front of the pack.  Smokey's picking one.  Smokey's picking one.  Come on.  A gun.  Please end the nightmare.  Please end the nightmare, Lewis says.  How do you feel your chances are there, Smokey?  Smokey.  What do you feel your chances are?  Pretty good?  80, 20.  Yes, exactly.  Okay.  Why?

Andrew has chosen.  He is now preparing himself.  Because I'm not saying take down your pants anymore. 
[01:32:30]  And...  He's got his pants like halfway down, you guys.  Oh, well.  He was great.  He was great at the end of Ghostbusters.  All right.  Let's listen.  Listen.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Nope.  Wow.  Here it is.  It's a 50-50 shot.  Two are left.  Two contestants in this round.  50-50 shots.  And we got two staple guns.  One has the staples.  And what excitement.  He's picking one.

Now, does he get a waste of it?  Or do you put one in?  No, you got to put one in.  It might be empty.  You got to put one in.  No, it isn't.  What are you doing? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  You got to give him a short one.  No, there's only one left.  Yeah, no.  You got to give him the live one.  You got to give him a live one.  You ever watch Deer Hunter?

Come on.  Do it.  Oh, my God. 
[01:34:00]  How did that feel?  How did that feel, John?  Give me those plays.  Pull that out of his ass.  He flinched up really bad.  Okay, well.  All right, we got to say goodbye to John.

Six guns.  Rick, are you readjusting?  Yeah.  Seven guns left.  Mix them around.  No cheating.  No looking.  He's shuffling the staplers around.  Seven left.  And we're ready to rock.  All right.  Carmen is up.  As we move on with staple gun roulette. 
[01:39:00]  Melissa has the staple gun.  Now.  Oh.  The sigh of relief is the best part of this.  Anyone willing to take a staple in his ass can do a shout out on my show anytime.  Andrew's up.  You all right, Andrew?  Yeah.  I'm a little nerve-wracking.  It's nerve-wracking, right?  Yeah.  Wondering if you're going to be the one.  Okay.  He's picked out a staple gun.  Alexis has it.  I'm going to go back this time, you guys.  Whatever.  Whatever you want to put it. 
[01:39:30]  Okay.  Here we go.  No.  Nothing.  Wow.  Andrew makes it on.  He moves on.  Another sigh of relief.  How many left?  Five.  Mike has picked out a staple gun.  Mike picks one.  Yep.  Mike picks one out.  All right.  Here we go.  Don't be scared.  Here we go.  It's okay.  The staple being placed against his...  Buttocks.  Here we go.  Wow. 
[01:40:00]  His eyes were shut so tight.  Mike, you all right?  Still in.  It's the anticipation is the best part of this.  His eyes were shut so tight.  All right.  Pat is up.  Back up to Pat.  Can I get an F you real quick?  Yeah, go ahead.  Ah, you people in my life, you know who you are.  It's about four years.  F you.  All right.  Ex-girlfriend, old friends, people who betray this one.  All right.  It's always...  Ex-girlfriend.  It's really good.  I want to say hi to my ex-girlfriend.  Hi. 
[01:40:30]  Hope you're doing well.  Hope you're getting banged very nicely.  All right.  All right.  Here goes Pat.  Here we go.  Let's all be quiet.  Oh, my goodness.  Alexis has the staple gun to his butt.  Oh!  We have lost another guy!  It goes deep.  It goes deep.  Look.  Help that guy.  Oh, wait.  I got it.  You got it out?  Did you get it?  And there it is.  Oh, man.  He's like...  This goes deep.  All right, Pat. 
[01:41:00]  We've lost Pat.  Pat's out.  Another stapler now is removed, as is one of our contestants.  He was in shock after he got hit.  And then he's like, this guy, he tried to get it out.  He goes, this is a deep.  He was in shock and then realized he got hit.  And then he made some noise out of him.  All right.  We're on.  We're up to the next round.  Rick is shuffling the stapler.  Shuffling the stapler.  What's amazing is those staples are really sharp.  I mean, those are like...  This is really, really not right.  A lot of people pissed off because all they see on the awesome cam is Rick's arm. 
[01:41:30]  Wow.  All right.  We're up to Sean.  Sean is picking a staple gun from the counter.  Now we're moving.  I think I'm nice and hot.  Yeah, this will really go fast now.  Yep.  Now we're moving.  It's Melissa.  Melissa Ann with the staple gun.  Sean is breathing.  He's breathing.  He's anticipating.  Oh, my God.  I can't do it.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You all right, Sean?  This is just madness.  Okay. 
[01:42:00]  Now we're up to Rob.  Rob's picking a staple gun.  Rob has picked one.  We have handed it over to Alexis Winston.  Rob is also the young Frank Gorshin, I think.  Oh.  There you go.  Frank Gorshin.  Louis Black, Town Hall.  No?  Friday.  Ticketmaster.  Rob has made it through the round.  Ed Harris made it through one more round.  Smokey.  Smokey.  Smokey.  Smokey.  Smokey's up.  Smokey has picked one.  Turn around, Smokey.  Yeah.  I got it.  Thank you. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  Smokey has picked out a staple gun.  Smokey has picked out a staple gun.  And here we go.  Smokey.  Smokey's like a pot experiment.  Done bad.  Let's listen.  Let's listen in.  Get one in.  What?  Do you have a shout out?  Do you have a shout out?  Come on.  Come on.  Get done.  All right.  Go ahead, Melissa.  You got it?  Oh.  Stop it.  Stop.  Would you stop with that?  He doesn't know.  One more though.  He doesn't.  I know.  He doesn't know. 
[01:43:00]  One more is disqualification.  All right.  Smokey has made it to the next round.  We only have...  We're all bunched up.  Anthony, we have three staple guns left on the counter.  One of them has the live round.  He is...  Carmen's back.  Another shout out, Carmen?  You're all set with the shout outs?  Maybe a neighbor or something?  Yeah.  Give us another shout out.  Parole officer?  No.  Drug dealer?  What?  No?  Okay.  He's picked a staple gun, Anthony.  Here we go.  It's in Alexis...  Alexis...  Her hands there. 
[01:43:30]  And...  Wow.  Nothing.  Oh, my God.  We're down to two.  We're down to two staplers.  All right.  Look.  This is what we do for the...  Hold on.  This is what we do for this round.  Andrew gets to pick first.  And then Mike grabs the one that's left.  And you guys do it at the same time.  Very good.  Because one of them is definitely out here.  Well, you went to radio college.  Yeah.  See?  All right.  So now...  Two at once.  Two at once.  One of these staple guns has the live round. 
[01:44:00]  Let's mic.  We got to mic both of them.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get that mic in front of both of them there.  Stand in a way that his face is on that mic.  Rick, Rick.  Get Mike over here.  You just got to move all the way over to the mic.  Mike.  Yeah.  There you go.  Okay.  There you go.  And now kiss.  Ready?  One of them.  It'll be obvious who's out.  Let's listen.  Same time.  Oh! 
[01:44:30]  Oh!  Andrew is out!  Mike makes it to the next round!  How you feeling, Andrew?  Get that out.  And he's got it out of his butt.  Sorry, Andrew.  Oh, Andrew.  Sorry, man.  There you go.  Let's say goodbye to Andrew.  How many left now?  How many we got?  We're only down to, uh, what?  Five contestants?  Right?  Yeah.  We got five left.  Down to five. 
[01:45:00]  Now it's going to start going real fast.  It makes you wonder what, uh, how much the nervous system gets to the butt.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Did you see Mike's face when he realized it wasn't him?  I know.  He's like, oh, thank God.  Thank God.  Rick's shuffling around again.  Mike, you all right?  I'm all right.  You were...  I was so nervous.  That was the worst.  You were freaked out there, man.  And then, and then they were fine.  And there's like a delayed reaction.  It took them a while to realize, wait, it wasn't me.  Yeah.  Okay.  Who's up?  We got Sean.  Everyone's up.  Sean back up there.  Pick a staple gun.  Five guys left. 
[01:45:30]  This is for the trip to King of the Ring.  Here we go.  Where do you want to go?  Where?  Oh, my God.  And...  We didn't.  No.  Wow.  Sean moves on.  There's no major artery there, is there?  We'll find out.  I think the underside of the mule is where you should have done it.  All right.  Rob has picked a staple gun.  All right.  Getting down to the end now.  We only have five contestants left.  Alexis has the staple gun in her hand. 
[01:46:00]  He has a body like a retired gay hustler.  He's already got all these scars.  He's already got all these scars on him.  Here we go.  All right.  Take that.  Nothing.  Wow, nothing.  Oh, man.  All right.  Wow.  There have not been any staples in the first few staples.  Amazing.  You guys are psychic.  Wow.  Look who's back up.  Smokey.  Smokey.  Here comes Smokey.  I have a feeling that Smokey's going to win the whole damn thing. 
[01:46:30]  Keep messing up, Smokey.  You ready, Smokey?  Ready?  Oh, you know I'm ready.  Okay.  Got one.  Ow!  Ah!  Oh, Smokey is out.  Smokey, okay?  Smokey.  No, it's pain.  Oh, my God.  Let's say goodbye to Smokey.  He's completely insane.  Bye-bye, Smokey.  That's good.  And then to those shenanigans. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, you miss them already, Lewis.  Oh, man.  Anthony, we're going to take a break, and we're going to finish up Staple Gun Roulette next.  We have four contestants left.  Yes.  Three guns will be empty.  One will be full.  That's right.  And we got the lovely Melissa Ann and Alexis Winston in the studio.  Yeah.  Two pets of the year.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We continue in a minute.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:47:30]  It's Staple Gun Roulette on the show today.  We're down to, what, four contestants?  Four contestants.  The guys are making their way back into the studio.  And why don't you explain real fast?  Maybe people just tuning in.  They got out of work late today.  I don't know.  We started with ten guys and ten Staple Guns. 
[01:48:00]  One of the Staple Guns full of staples.  The other nine empty.  And each one would come up, pick a Staple Gun,  and one of our lovely penthouse pets would take that Staple Gun,  and put it against their ass, and they hit it.  And whoever got the Staple was out for that round.  We are now down to four contestants, four staplers,  three of which are empty.  One has staples in it.  And we continue. 
[01:48:30]  The winner is the guy that does not get hit with a staple.  Yep.  Now, we were talking to the ladies during the commercials,  and they were bitching because one of these guys,  one of the guys was kind of sporting and showing his mule.  His mule, they said his mule was sticking straight out.  Rob?  Rob.  Yeah, I saw your fur.  You might not have realized it, but you did.  Get it where you can. 
[01:49:00]  I was going to say, I don't blame the guy.  When's the next time you'll be able to do that without getting arrested?  Good man.  Penthouse Pets of the Year.  All right, Anthony, we got, like you said,  we're down to four staple guns on the counter.  One is loaded, three are not.  Who's up next?  Carmen?  Carmen.  No more shout-outs, right?  All right.  This is for the trip to see King of the Ring, Anthony,  in Columbus, Ohio.  Columbus Beckins.  WWE pay-per-view.  You also may notice the staple gun may hit a different area of your body. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, we forgot to tell everybody.  Because this is the finals.  This is the finals, so you guys have to make it harder.  So, drop them lower.  We're going lower.  Oh, dude, the guy's naked.  Jesus.  All right, let's be quiet, though.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's be quiet.  Here we go.  Listen.  Oh, God. 
[01:50:00]  Lewis, what do you think?  I think EMT.  Oh, he's limping.  He's limping.  You all right?  Wait, he's hurting a little bit.  You're limping.  Wow.  You all right?  Do you have it out?  There we go.  I think he's more bummed that he just lost the trip to Columbus.  Come on.  You all right?  Yeah, he's okay.  He seems bummed.  You all right?  He's bummed that he's out.  It didn't hurt too bad?  Yeah.  I think he needs to give a shout-out now.  Yeah, any last shout-outs, Joe Brown? 
[01:50:30]  No, look, he's bumming.  He's really bummed that he lost the contest.  All these guys are going to get some parting gifts, so don't worry about it, okay?  Parting gifts.  I don't know.  Lewis, Black, what do you want me to say?  You've won the Datsun B210.  Right.  All right, Mike is up.  What are we down to?  We're down to three.  Three staple guns and three contestants, Anthony.

This is for the trip to Columbus for the pay-per-view, King of the Ring, WWE.  Who is up next?  Sean.  All right, Sean gets to pick first.  What we're going to do is both guys are going to get shot at the same time.  Right.  It'll be very obvious who wins and who loses.  Here we go.  Sean, you get to pick.  Rob gets the remaining stapler. 
[01:52:00]  Sure you want that?  Here it is.  Comes down to 50-50 shot.  All right.  Sean has picked a staple gun.  That means Rob has the one that is remaining on the counter.  Hold on.

Wait, wait, wait, Rick.  Rick, that mic's got to be right on top of it.  Yeah.  All right, get everyone set up nice.

Same place.  Same place as last guy.  But hold on.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Get it in position.  I got a little bit more cushion here than I do.  Just get it in position.

You can't get that one out.  You can't get in there.  I don't believe the needle-nose pliers are pulling the staples out.  That was bad.  Oh.  What a cheer for us.  Thank you, Rob.  Good.  Yeah, look at this.  Thank you, guys.  Have fun at King of the Ring, all right?  Thank you.

Well, they were, yeah, we saw them bleeding pretty good.  I know.  Well, I guess at this point we should tell a lot of people, well, these guys were pretty  pickled.  They were drinking for, like, three straight hours.  I know.  Next time we can't anesthetize our contestants. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, they were?  Oh, yeah.  Except for Smokey.  He was just like that.  Smokey didn't get enough air when his mom was at the umbilical cord around his neck.  Smokey, we've been drinking formaldehyde.  We got a breech birth.  Hi, Smokey.  Your mom was quite a drinker, wasn't she?  Hey, Seth, what's going on?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Hey, man.

[02:00:00]  Look at Louis.  Look at Louis.  No.  Self-esteem.  You're ahead of the year.  You don't need self-esteem.  I know.  No.  I just like hearing that a pet of the year has the same problems we all have.  That's really good.  We all, I have the same problems everybody trusts me.  Really?  You have AIDS too?  I don't know.  I'm going to take it that far.  Don't take it that far.  I'm going to take it that far.  Jeez.  Jordan comes through at 626.  I told you, my 651 is that somebody else.  All right.

Do they actually make your mule bigger or do they just shrink your hands?  No.  Well, see, you'd have to.  I don't know about that because I don't know.  Like a boss.  I don't go down there.  Look how big it is in my hands.  I know.  These girls could be talking about physics.  You guys would just be, uh-huh.  Oh, I did.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Anthony and I do not like having hot girls in here because it just ruins the radio show. 
[02:01:30]  I mean, we love looking at hot girls, but it's just, we're getting nothing done.  Except for us, too.  We're, we're good sports.  Yeah.  Well, you're crazy if you want to, if you want to do anything for those.  Huh?  Because you have a bond with us.  Yes, we do.  We were on the show when you guys were syndicated that day.  Yeah.

That's wild.  And actually.  Yeah, you'd think it would take away the feeling.  Supposed to.  Because.  Anything else wrong with you guys that you want us to check out?  Yeah, you can guess my age.  What's my age?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't. 
[02:03:00]  No, I'll be asked to look at your taint to do that.  No, she didn't.  No one heard it.  No, she didn't.  What happened?  She didn't tell her age.  No, you did.  Okay, so look at your taint.  How old do you think I am?  There's a whole thing I do.  But you said you're 28.  Yeah.  She's.  I don't know.  That's right.  She did say her age.  Oh, she did?  Then I can't tell her.  Yeah.  Because I don't want people to think I fake her.  Who cares what they think when you're looking at that?  I really don't.  Yeah.  I don't know, but someone will call me out on it.  So what?  Let them.  What?  I know what it is, but I'll tell you if it's right when you guess.  Do you want me to recall?  Do you really honestly think you're going to get to check her age? 
[02:03:30]  Does it really matter?  No, it's the way Opie does it.  Okay, go ahead.  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  He is actually a miracle worker when it comes to this.  Oh, I want to know.  How many girls have come in?  So make eye contact and tell her how you do it.  How many girls have come in, Opie?  Tell her how you're doing, Opie.  How many girls have you guessed the age on?  I think I'm like seven for seven.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Seven for seven.  Give me the go ahead.  Two to the year.  It's amazing, buddy.  You have to be completely naked.  He looks.  Really?  Okay, but I have an issue of Penthouse that I'm in this month, the August issue. 
[02:04:00]  I'll show it to you.  Because it's not just naked.  Yeah, but it's a little furry down here.  Tell her what you do, Opie.  Wait, wait, wait.  Opie, she's going to tell you what he does.  Tell her where you look.  I would use the magazine, but with some airbrushing, it's going to throw off my powers.  No, Penthouse magazine does not airbrush nothing.  It's not close enough, and you can't see what he has to look at.  She does have a skirt on, so that will be easier.  Oh, I'm curious.  Opie, tell her what you have to look at.  No, you can tell me with clothes on.  How old do you think I am?  No, but that's not the gag.  It's not the test.  What do you look at?  The taint area. 
[02:04:30]  You're seven for seven.  What?  He looks right at a girl's taint.  What's the taint?  It taint the front, and it taint the back.  Is that the cookie?  It's the middle, right?  Well, I'd take a look at the whole area, and I could tell a lot about it, girl.  What?  How is that?  Yeah.  Does it grow?  He has never told anybody.  It's just something that has been passed down from my dad.  Yeah, like the rings on a tree thing.  Are you serious?  Did your dad show you that trick when you were young, did he?  He's amazing.  I'm totally serious.  Are you serious?  Yes.  By looking at that.  I will be within a year. 
[02:05:00]  You're seven for seven.  Guaranteed.  Come on, let him do it.  So, if I show you my cookie.  No cameras.  No cameras.  You'll tell me how old I am?  Yeah.  I need about 15 to 20 seconds.  Okay.  You're staring at it?  Let's do it.  I need about 15 to 20 minutes.  I might pass out.  Now, you'll be fine.  All right.  Look at everyone shifting in the studio.  You got to turn around.  I'm not wearing panties.  Penthouse pets don't wear panties.  What happened down there, though?  I got in a treadmill accident.  Oh, okay.  What happened?  Listen to you.  What happened down there?  Yeah, you got to turn around and that way. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, good God.  Who cares how old she is?  What?  You got to bend over and lift up.  Yeah, and then he looks.  No cameras.  No, no cameras.  But now look, Opie.  That's what he's got to look at.  That's what he's got to look at.  I think you should know.  I think you should be able to tell from my cookie.  I think you should just be able to tell from my cookie.  Let me show the other.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  You can see from there.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  There you go.  I'm curious.  You could tell, see?  You know what?  I know what you're looking at, and it's great. 
[02:06:00]  You have probably the best one I've ever seen.  Wow.  There's no problems there.  Look at how...  Okay, calm down.  I have friends that I noticed.  I noticed.  Oh, my God.  I know girls.  I know what you're looking at.  What are you looking at?  Well, I don't know if I understand that.  What am I looking at?  I think you're looking at the girls' parts and how well they've been used.  I think it's called the size.  And that's with age.  No, he never tells anybody this. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, and I think that that's what you're looking at.  And I know that mine's fine.  And I'm ready.  You're ready.  What?  Do you want to double check?  He's good.  Yeah, I'm going to double check.  A little double check.  Mine's fine.  Oh, my God.  Look at Norton comes running by here.  Can Lois see this?  No, no, no, no.  This is just for me and you.  But he doesn't get to see this type of thing.  No, this is just for you and me.  All right.  It is.  All right.  I've got to do a little subtraction.  I don't care.  I know.  Okay.  I'm there.  You got it?  How old is she?  How old am I? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, boy.  Twenty...  Oh, that's going out on a limb.  Yeah.  And notice that I'm shaved.  And this month in Penthouse, I'm not.  So, it's a little...  It's a little different.  Okay.  All natural.  They're going to dump out.  So, don't say anything.  Twenty...  Twenty-six.  Oh, you heard me on the air.  I did not.  Are you...  You got it again?  Twenty-six.  Son of a bitch.  Every time.  I nailed it, right?  Twenty-six.  Yay.  Again.  Again. 
[02:07:30]  Our first ever Penthouse pet.  Wow.  Twenty-six.  Twenty-six.  But you need to tell us the secret.  I can't.  Yeah.  Well, we want to use it.  You're looking at something down there that's telling me.  Well, you see, like, you look at that.  You're looking at something.  Stop pointing.  You subtract that and that, and you add that.  You add what?  Wait, wait.  You add what?  That.  This?  No.  Down more.  You count this.  The thigh or...  No.  You count this times two minus seven for that. 
[02:08:00]  And that.  Twenty-six.  That's BS.  Twenty-six.  Positive.  It's hot, huh?  It's very hot.  Very hot.  Trust me.  It's very hot.  Yeah, it's hot.  Okay.  Yep, you get it.  Wow.  Yep.  Melissa is amazed over there.  I am.  I'm, like, taken away right now.  We only do that little thing with special girls.  Very special, yeah, because it rarely ever happens.  Because they won't let you look at it, probably.  No, you're right.  It only hits me every once in a while.  It's a weird thing how that happens. 
[02:08:30]  Sometimes Ann wants me to guess, and I'm just not feeling the power.  One time, he actually said, and I swear, I don't remember who it was, but he guessed  the age, and it was a year lower than the age, and then before anything, he went, no,  no, wait a minute.  Your birthday's in December or something.  Like, he knew that it was close enough, and then he put the age over where it was  supposed to be.  Like, he looked again, and then realized. 
[02:09:00]  That's impressive.  So, he can tell within months, I think.  Why are you doing this for a living?  He should be in a carnival.  Why are you doing radio?  Do that for a living.  Look at Lewis.  You're amazed, right?  He's jealous.  He's jealous.  I wouldn't be doing radio, okay?  I would take this act on the road.  I could be like one of those kids.  I'd be going from village to town, going, you know, ha, ha, ha.  I could do the guess your weight gig.  You could do the guess your hoo-ha.  That was very good.  Go from village to town.  What year are you living in, Lewis?  I go from village to town to Hamlet. 
[02:09:30]  Hear ye, hear ye.  Hear ye, hear ye.  You talk like a Paul Revere speech.  I'm like, is the bruise okay, though?  Okay, so you guys, do you guys want to know what happened?  Yes, she's got...  Oh, my God, it's so bad.  Dude, she's got a huge bruise on the ground.  Okay, so I have a huge...  Okay, so you guys want to hear the messed up story, seriously?  Of course we do.  I'm running on my treadmill.  Yeah.  And I get distracted.  James, stop this crazy thing.  I get distracted by somebody whipping me with a dog leash.  Sorry.  Oh.  Okay, as I'm running, so I fall off the treadmill. 
[02:10:00]  And keep in mind, treadmills keep going.  They don't stop.  So they keep going.  The treadmill keeps going.  So I'm jammed in between the wall and the treadmill.  Oh, my God.  And thank God it didn't hit my cookie, because I was a bit of a bruise there.  Yeah, I have a bruise that's on my cookie, and I can't shoot for a while, but...  When did he start running on the treadmill?  Wow.  Well, now I'm kind of a little scared of the treadmill.  But yeah, so I got the bruise there, and it was jamming me.  And I have a scratch on my back from it, too.  I have a little...  Oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  That's a big scratch.  Like, it jammed me against the wall.  And was the treadmill going...  And rubbing on you?  Oh, my God.  And I was so upset, because I'm like, this thing won't turn off.  It doesn't realize that I'm against the wall.  You know, whenever you've imagined...  I wonder what type of accidents penthouse pets have.  Really?  Yes.  Well, yeah.  Was it making this noise?  Yeah, it was so messed up.  I finally, like, rolled over and got away from it. 
[02:11:00]  But I'm okay, and it didn't hurt my private parts, so I'm fine.  Yeah, thank God for that.  Like a sail on a windy day.  It's like a work-related injury.  You all right in there?  Who was whipping you with a dog?  Yeah.  Why didn't they help you?  Oh, um...  That's a little...  That's the odd part of the story.  No, actually, no.  A friend of mine was, like, messing around.  It was just...  Really, it sounds weird, but it was just like a joke.  And I obviously can't concentrate and run at the same time.  I have to do one or the other. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Why didn't they help you?  Um...  Because it was too funny.  It was...  I was just going to say that because it was a little bit too funny.  So I...  So I...  It was...  It all happened so fast.  Oh, that's like...  Just the thought of that is...  Yeah.  Very painful.  So do you see what we modeled?  That's our next contest.  We're having 10 girls coming with treadmills.  I...  I...  Wow.  You're beautiful.  Thank you for that.  You're welcome.  That was a lot of fun today.  Usually I hate doing that.  Well, thank you for having us. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, right.  Oh, man.  I like these.  We'll be back with the Opian Anthony Show.  Stay...  Whore.  This Thursday.  Filthy whore.  Sex for Sam.  Three.  The Opian Anthony Show.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Grab a brush and put a little makeup.  I just have to fade away the shakeup.  I just have to fade away the shakeup.  Watch your name and keep them on the table.  Here you go, create another table.  You want to do it.  Grab a brush and put a little makeup.  You want to do it.  I just got the banter with the shakeup.  You want it to. 
[02:12:30]  Why'd you leave the keys up on the table?  You want it to.  Well, I don't think you trust me.  I...  Self-righteous suicide.  I...  Cry...  When angels deserve to die.  This is the Opian Anthony Show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Jim?  How did I know that the judge who was going after these cops was a woman? 
[02:13:00]  How did I know it?  Making the cops identify themselves.  How did you know it was a chick?  Jim, Jim, Jim, we're not going to play that game.  We are.  We have something planned that we have to get to.  Promise the listeners.  What was it, though?  I don't know.  It was a long break.  Oh, my God.  Concentrate.  It's out of the concert.  Short-term memory.  What was it?  Look around.  Look around.  I feel like I'm living memento right now.  Do I have it tattooed on my arm somewhere?  Did you write it down?  Did you take a picture of it? 
[02:13:30]  Lots of notes around Sex for Sam 3.  Oh, we've got to talk about that.  We've got to get contestants.  Hotel Keys.  I think we did do that, right?  Talked about Hotel Keys?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Top 25 funniest people.  Oh, what an awful list.  That wasn't it?  What an awful list.  That wasn't it?  I think it was.  Dude, tell Tommy Lee to call back because our listeners will hang us.  They'll hang us today. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, I got it.  Details Magazine.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  You're always making me forget that one.  I thought we had gotten to that weeks ago.  No.  No?  I have a pile of stuff on my desk.  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, it's stuff we've talked about.  I have an article on weird fetishes we never got to.  Oh, God.  Remember that?  I got an article on the top 50 worst movies of all time.  Mm-hmm.  All this stuff that we're supposed to make for some good radio. 
[02:14:30]  And...  I threw it all in the garbage.  Yeah.  I was too embarrassed to even bring it back up on the show.  Remember the what's your favorite ice cream thing?  I don't think that was us.  What are we?  Howie Carr?  Yeah, Boston.  There's one for you.  Okay.  Anthony, why it's okay to pay for sex.  Why it's okay to pay for sex. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  In a perfect relationship, the man never strays.  But who's perfect?  The next best thing to being faithful, a guy who admits to hiring hookers, Anthony.  Wow.  A lot of controversy with this article in Details Magazine.  Yes, Jim Norton.  You're saying it just seems like you have a real catch in your studio and you didn't know it.  The next best thing to being faithful.  The next best thing to being faithful is paying for it?  Yep.  I agree.  Hmm.  Let me read a little further.  All right.  A real catch. 
[02:15:30]  Let me begin by stating I wouldn't dream of paying for sex.  Never have, never will.  The thought of $120 worth of gentleman's relief at the local Thai massage parlor.  Are the Thais doing the massages these days?  I wouldn't know and I never paid $120.  That's too obscure a number.  Unless it's before four on Sunday, in which case it's $92.50.  Oh.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  This guy's a riot. 
[02:16:00]  Boy, we could only dream we could write for Details Magazine.  Oh.  Ah.  In which case it's $92.50.  Disgust me.  Nevertheless, I have a very close friend who's indulged once or thrice.  Thrice meaning three times.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  And I'd like you to consider the possibility that he isn't a complete loser.  Maybe, just maybe, paying for a piece isn't as morally reprehensible as Lynn Cheney would have us believe. 
[02:16:30]  Who's paid in here?  We know Norton.  I've never paid.  Anyone ever in your, uh, in your, uh, history of...  You're paying right now.  Rick shows his wedding ring and says he's paying right now.  I've never paid either.  Never paid.  I never paid either.  I never paid because I always had a radio show.  I was...  You don't need to pay because you have a big, delicious Italian mule and Rick is really handsome.  I was just always petrified.  No, he's paid.  You have to.  Anyone that looks like Curious George has to have paid for sex.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:17:00]  Jeez.  Wow.  Can you turn that, turn around the phone screens because our ass-wipe listeners are trying to distract us.  We gotta get to this today.  Alright, uh, as Xaviera Hollander, remember her?  The happy hooker?  Xaviera Hollander, yes.  Uh, pointed out in the happy hooker, hiring a prostitute isn't all that different from stumbling through the dating maze.  It's just a shortcut to getting the cheese.  Now, you know something?  That is the thing I read that was like, okay, I see that point.  Like, if you're not in a serious relationship and you're dating, you're, you're paying for what amounts to sex. 
[02:17:30]  You're not looking for a relationship.  You want to get laid.  You go out.  You're going to be spending money.  It's just going to food or movies or a play or whatever the hell you're doing.  You're paying money in exchange for, uh, sex.  And it's not even guaranteed.  You're paying for the pre-show when you just want to get to the game.  Right.  Uh, in both cases, you're spending money to avoid having to do your own handiwork. 
[02:18:00]  There you go.  Okay.  Indeed, Hollander argues that the, uh, covenant between working girl and John is more honest.  Neither party has to pretend it's about anything other than sex when you go to a hooker.  Mm-hmm.  Or as Charlie Sheen put it, this is a great line, you're not paying them to sleep with you, you're paying them to leave.  To leave.  That's when you're Charlie Sheen.  When you're any one of us, you're paying for them to sleep with you.  That's really easy to say when you're a good-looking guy who starred in Platoon and Wall Street. 
[02:18:30]  But girls who are with me want to leave.  Idiot Charlie Sheen.  As quickly as possible.  Yeah, like we all have that problem.  Well, but you know, the model didn't want to get out of my apartment.  Jim, you're out of your mind.  No, I'm not.  You've never been with a girl.  Of course I have.  And you just wanted to have sex.  Absolutely.  And she was still there.  Yes.  And you were trying to figure out how to get her out.  Yes.  Yes, I'm just saying that that's not, I pay for sex.  It's not like I have the option to get laid whenever I absolutely want to get laid.  Right.  Okay.  Let me tell you something that a lot of people might not know. 
[02:19:00]  One of the highs in getting escorts, it's not necessarily the act or the finishing.  The high is this.  It's that knock at the door.  The risky business knock.  It's the looking through the keyhole.  When I was young.  Are you kidding?  Wait a minute.  Because now this is intriguing.  This is this.  This is this.  And then do you all of a sudden go like, oh, oh. 
[02:19:30]  It's here.  There's a woman there who will have sex with me.  She's a stranger.  And it's the look.  What does she look like?  Hold on.  It's the look.  Once again, I could completely.  I am so with you.  Look at Jimmy.  No, I am so with him again.  Because risky business.  When we were growing up, that movie was kind of popular.  Oh, but look what came to the door first.  You're so right.  But it was that whole, oh, my God.  Sex has arrived at my door.  They walk in.  They're wearing a skirt.  They sit down on the bed.  They usually have to call the agency.  But you know, as long as you're not a complete pig. 
[02:20:00]  Hey, how are you?  It's okay to rub the leg.  I mean, you don't go to be becoming a pig.  So you step right up and like, hey, how are you doing?  I know.  Hey, come on in.  I'm very cool.  I know.  But I know I can touch them.  I know that I'm looking at that beautiful body and those great legs and that beautiful ass.  And I want to touch it.  I can.  It's okay.  I love that.  Holy jeez.  It's not just about the sex.  It's about the control you get with it.  And I'm not an abusive.  I don't beat up on it.  I mean, I'm into it.  Right, right.  I'm actually a pretty easy date when it comes to that stuff.  You hit on something.  Because the whole risky business scene, yeah, it turned out to be a disaster. 
[02:20:30]  But when all of a sudden the ding dong and he was all alone, his parents were away for  the weekend, that was like a major turn on for me checking out that scene until it was  that horrific sight.  It's the complete lack of being self-conscious.  It's about taking over your shirt, not caring what your body looks like because you know she's  beautiful.  But it doesn't matter because the arrangement is money equals this.  The arrangement's been fixed.  So all this stuff is okay.  That's what that's about.  It's not just, I mean, you want to get, you know, what you want to get. 
[02:21:00]  That's part of it.  But it's certainly not all of it.  So you're all like, you hear the knock and you go like, oh, here it is.  Here it is.  Yeah, because you're pacing, dude.  Do you savor that moment?  Yes.  Do you do it slow and walk to the door and go, okay, what's this going to be like?  Who is she going to?  Like shower first, especially in hotels on the road, man.  It's kind of like opening up a birthday present from grandma.  You just don't know what you're going to get.  Dude, what does she look like?  Look through the door.  That woman is here to have sex with me for what I have in my pocket, which is money. 
[02:21:30]  And I'll give it to her.  If you're on hold, stay there.  But we've got to go right to the hotline.  A guy that might know a little bit about hookers.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Who, me?  Yeah.  Hey, Mr. Lee.  What's up, Tommy?  What's up, guys?  No, we were just talking to everybody about paying for it.  I know.  I heard the conversation.  Yeah, escorts and hookers and stuff.  I have to assume you've done that a couple of times at least. 
[02:22:00]  I think everyone should own one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  When you're Tommy Lee, you don't have to, though.  Yeah, see, that's just it.  You go out, you pick up some chick.  He's a rock star, and he has a mule the size of a small community.  Everyone knows about that.  Everyone's seen that on the tape.  Yeah, that made for some great Thanksgiving viewing, Tommy.  I'm so glad that we get to talk to you today, because I've always wanted to thank you.  We brought that tape to Thanksgiving dinner, swear to God, and watched it upstairs while  mom and sis and the aunts were cooking the turkey. 
[02:22:30]  We all went upstairs to see you rail, Pam.  You pervert.  You pervert.  You know something, though?  You're lucky.  You're lucky.  You're lucky that you were endowed like that, because it was a big hit.  People saw the tape and went, wow, look at Tommy Lee's hog.  And you could have been one of those guys, a little puny thing, and then you'd be going  through life embarrassed.  Yeah.  Okay.  You've got to be psyched at that gun out there.  Who are you kidding?  Hell yeah. 
[02:23:00]  If I got a 14-incher, I want the world to know.  I'd be happy with six.  Hey, Tommy, I've got to ask you, I saw Pam on, what the hell was she on last night?  CNN?  Larry King.  Larry King.  Why are we even talking about the P word?  Because she was claiming...  I've got to go, guys.  Bye.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  He hangs up for talking about Pam?  What a faggot.  What a dick.  All right, Tommy Lee, officially an ass wipe. 
[02:23:30]  Why would he hang up?  Why would he hang up?  You were tooling her, you idiot.  It got out on video.  You were married.  No one doesn't know.  Why are we bringing up the P word?  He wants to promote some golf tournament.  Wow, that's exciting, radio.  Let's talk about a golf tournament.  Want to talk about her and her goddamn hep and the fact that she says Tommy gave it to  him?  What gave it to her?  What is wrong with these people?  Did Tommy Lee lose his mind?  I didn't see if you were getting nasty.  Did he lose his friggin' mind? 
[02:24:00]  He wasn't even happy that we brought up the sex tape.  I was complimenting the guy.  I got to go.  Then go.  Go F yourself.  Have a sense of humor.  You jack off.  Like, anyone wants to hear about anything else that you're doing.  You're not exactly at the peak of your music career right now.  We want to talk about the sex you had.  We want to talk about the hep C.  The hep thing, Pam.  Does she have a big C?  The interesting stuff.  Not a golf tournament and your latest CD.  Hey, want to ask why you didn't have a lifeguard at the party? 
[02:24:30]  We'll plug your crap.  We'll plug it.  Yeah.  Why don't you stick that mammoth mule in the pool and let the kid climb out on it?  Come on.  Why are we going to sit there and plug stuff and not get something that would be worthwhile  for this program?  Like, talk about Pam.  He should have used his schlong to separate the shallow end from the deep end of the pool.  Like that thing they put across the pool. 
[02:25:00]  When you hit the throbbing vein, turn back, children.  Oh, my God.  You know, I'm glad this happened today.  It's a perfect example why.  Because a lot of people ask us, a lot of journalists ask us, a lot of listeners, why you guys don't  have more famous people on the show.  That's why.  That's why.  They all have major attitudes.  And they got an agenda.  Well, yeah, they could come on your show, but they will only talk about a stupid golf tournament.  And nobody was being a dick to him. 
[02:25:30]  Like, you weren't saying anything, like, messed up about Pam Anderson or him.  I didn't want to talk about Pam.  And I saw her on Larry King.  And I wanted to comment on the hepatitis thing.  I got to go.  I got to go.  Obviously, you're not going to rescue children, are you?  Well, he was being a dick.  He was just a dick.  That's not cool rocker.  Hey, here's my crib.  Hey, here's where my dogs hang out.  Yeah, my dog.  That wasn't cool rocker.  That was uptight asswipe that doesn't want to talk about anything that anyone wants to 
[02:26:00]  hear about.  He wants to plug stuff and get off.  Well, it don't work that way on this show.  It does not work that way.  Give and take, it's called.  We used to play that game, and we gave our listeners horrible radio.  Horrible effing radio.  Nothing more.  Hey, why are we bringing up the P word?  No more.  Oh, God disgusts me.  Another rock hero gone.  Gone.  Ugh.  That's why.  You know something? 
[02:26:30]  I'd rather have cool guys on the way up on this program.  We got, like, when Andrew WK sits in, he'll talk about anything.  You know something?  Has the guy sold as many albums as Motley Crue has?  No.  He's on his way up.  He's a cool, regular guy.  Tommy Lee, been through the mill, been at the top of the friggin' rock heap, back down  on the downside of the slide, and you'd think he'd have something to talk about.  There's only been books written about their sex lives and the debauchery that the crew's  been through. 
[02:27:00]  It's known, Tommy.  You went out with Pam.  You were married to the woman.  You had kids with her.  What?  What is it?  A secret?  That's all in the book.  All of a sudden, we can't talk about Pam Anderson.  These celebrities are delusional.  They are effing delusional.  Why do you think you're coming on a nationally syndicated radio show to talk about a stupid  golf tournament?  There are golf tournaments every day, these celebrity golf tournaments.  And if he would have talked with us, we'd have plugged it like we gave a flying F, too.  We would have given it a good plug. 
[02:27:30]  It would have sounded sincere.  Boy, what a surprise we bring up Pam when she was on Larry King last night.  Last night.  It wasn't like it happened two months ago.  She was blaming you for the hep.  I'd like to go to the horse's mouth and hear the answer.  But instead, we got the horse's ass.  Tommy Lee.  Wow, Tommy, you're real brave.  What a rocker.  When he said, I'm out of here, I thought.  What a rocker.  Suck it.  I thought he was kidding.  When he said, I'm out of here.  I thought he was kidding.  So did I. 
[02:28:00]  I thought he was kidding.  Oh, yeah.  Vince and Nicky, much cooler when they hung out.  They were talking.  They were talking about the past and their sex lives and everything.  They talked for like two and a half hours.  They answered every single question we threw at them.  Every single one.  Talked about Nicky getting thrown into a dumpster because they thought he was dead after he OD'd.  He told the whole story.  Yeah.  I think it was in Japan or something.  He OD'd.  And the people that were doing the drugs with him were like, holy S, we just killed the rock star. 
[02:28:30]  We got to get rid of him.  Threw him in a dumpster.  All the sex stories.  And also, he woke up.  You got to mention the tape, though.  You have to.  It's a very famous porno.  You have to.  The tape is famous.  He might be tired of talking about it.  But you know something?  People still want to hear from him about it.  It's part of, you know, doing what you do, Tommy.  It's part of getting your plugs out.  You got to give a little something first.  I'm not going to sit here.  We're not going to sit here and kiss your ass.  If my wife was accusing me of giving her hep, ex-wife, ex-wife, I would absolutely talk about it. 
[02:29:00]  And Ant wasn't married to another celebrity who was being interviewed on national television.  Yeah.  Well, it's still.  And I've talked about it plenty of times on this show.  Going into a situation like that, you're prepared.  You know they're going to be asking questions.  Every time we sit down to do an interview with one of these magazines or a paper or something or Bill O'Reilly, we know some of the questions are going to be a little uncomfortable.  I know those Olsen twins questions are coming.  I'll answer them.  So you decide, all right, do I want to put myself through this? 
[02:29:30]  I talked about the goddamn $300 engagement ring.  I talked about the hell night that was my wedding.  Rick, call him back.  Call him back.  Or the publicist.  Call him back.  We had a real good discussion about prostitutes.  If I had a good chance to clear my name and go, no, that's not true, that's not true, I would certainly do it.  I mean, I don't understand why somebody would want to do it.  We got more out of Pantera Phil and he was inebriated.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy's a rock star. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, I want to drink the green beers.  Get me a green beer and cigarettes.  And methadone.  I need methadone.  Shut up.  Shut up.  He was great.  Hold on.  Shut up.  What?  What?  Yeah, what?  15 years old, I burnt my parents' house down.  I don't want to get into it.  I plead the fifth.  He's a rock star. 
[02:30:30]  You're not scared of death?  No, not at all.  It's so overrated, you know.  I've died a bunch of times.  He's deaf.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Tommy.  What's up, man?  Hey, why are you guys calling me a dick, dude?  What's up?  What's up?  Because you called up.  Like, we want to talk to you about a little bit of everything and you hung up.  You know what?  You hold on.  You were told not to bring up the pain. 
[02:31:00]  What do you do?  No one told us anything.  Hey, Tommy.  No one tells us what to do, first of all.  And you were the big...  No one tells us what to do.  No one told us not to bring up Pam's name.  We would never agree to that, okay?  Yes, you were.  You were the big pussy for hanging up after we asked about it instead of trying to talk  your way out of it.  You guys did agree to it.  We did not!  My tour manager talked to your producer.  That's bulls**t.  Nope.  Nope.  We would never agree to that.  Sorry.  That's kind of a big story that we wanted to hear about. 
[02:31:30]  You know what, guys?  What year are you guys living in?  It's like...  Dude, turn the page, guys.  I've been divorced for three years.  Turn the page.  Turn the page.  Guys, it was big news last night when she was on Larry King accusing you of this.  Don't you think it's a current story if Pam is on Larry King saying pretty much that  you gave her hep C?  What was big news, guys?  What was big news?  Big news that she's on Larry King accusing you of giving her hep C. 
[02:32:00]  Dude, you know how many months ago she accused me of that?  It doesn't matter.  It happened last night on Larry King.  Of course we're going to bring it up.  She talked about it last night.  You know what?  She talked about it in some other stupid magazines as well.  Who cares?  Yeah, but this is the first time we're talking to you, so we'd like to, you know, maybe talk  to you about it.  Maybe get your side of the story.  You've never really given your side of the story, right?  You know why?  Why?  Because it's nobody's business.  Well, she's made it everyone's business.  Of course she is. 
[02:32:30]  She's an idiot.  I would just love to hear your side of it.  If an ex is accusing me of some crazy things, you know what?  I'm going on the biggest program I can find and then calling her a liar, a C, a twat.  Every name I can figure out.  Guys, I don't do that.  That's not my style, okay?  I don't do that crap.  That's why I just hung up the phone.  I was like, you know what?  I got to go.  Because that's not my style, guys.  It may be your style, but it ain't mine.  But you look like a pussy just hanging up.  We were totally confused. 
[02:33:00]  You didn't even say the first time you're on the phone, hey, guys, I thought we agreed  to this.  You know what?  I'm telling you man to man that it never got to us that we couldn't talk about Pam because  you know what?  We wouldn't have agreed to this interview.  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  Wow, we need Tommy Lee to make a good radio show.  If you say that, I'll take my ball and not play.  I know, man, you know.  Hey, you don't want to talk about it. 
[02:33:30]  Never agreed to it.  You don't want to talk about it.  Rick, did somebody tell you?  Maybe Ben.  Maybe Ben the producer.  Ben the producer.  Well, page six did say Ben is the producer of this program.  When I talk to their guy, they just ask, well, you know, just try not to dwell on it.  It'll probably come up.  And I'm like, yeah, it'll probably come up.  But, you know, he goes, as long as you talk about the music and the tour and he's doing  this golf thing.  You know something?  I'm like, yeah, we got all that on the paper right there.  I'm very open minded.  Let me tell you something.  If we started talking about it and he just told us what he told us there, look, this 
[02:34:00]  is what she's saying.  I don't like going in that direction.  To me, it's old news.  I'd rather just not really get into it.  It would have been like, all right, that's pretty much his side of it.  If he doesn't want to dwell on it.  And us being us, we might poke at it a little more and make a goof about it.  I'm sure Jim will say some tasteless thing into the mic about it.  But you know something?  He didn't.  He just hung up and it was like, what's he doing?  You call me a pussy.  I'm hanging up.  Oh, boy, Tommy, we really need you for our radio show. 
[02:34:30]  Right.  And last week when I talked to the guy about it, the Pam Anderson, Larry King thing didn't  even happen.  So who knew it would be one of the one of the things that's on everybody's mind today?  Jersey Bob here says, if I type in pussy, he'll disconnect from the internet.  Wait a minute.  There you go, Jersey Bob.  You were told.  You were told.  I'm told?  Tommy, maybe you should do your research on Ant and I.  No one tells us what to do.  We don't like being told things.  Believe me. 
[02:35:00]  You call him.  You see the hesitation?  He's like, oh, my God, he called me a pussy.  Now I've got to hang up.  No one else told that.  All of a sudden he goes, you call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  And also I'm just looking and you know he was confused like, oh, ass.  Now I've got to hang up.  I called him out on it.  You should have told him I will not have an ultimatum put to me.  It was that delayed.  Oh, brother.  Wow.  Now I've got to hang up and I really need to promote this new CD.  Now what do I do? 
[02:35:30]  Well, I guess I've got to hang up.  He's living in a bubble.  You know what I mean?  He says, what year are you living in?  That was three years ago.  No, it's still like, like Ope said, when you see her on Larry King the night before talking  about it, you would think, all right, for our side alone, just for this radio, it would  be interesting to hear his rebuttal on the whole thing.  So we're obligated to ask.  Even if his rebuttal is, I don't want to talk about it, that's not how I do things, that's 
[02:36:00]  fine.  That's fine.  Then we get into other things.  He's talking like this Larry King interview happened six months ago.  Yeah.  We talk about the Motley Crue days.  It happened last night.  You were told.  Plenty of other things we're talking about.  You were told.  Go F yourself.  Told.  E, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, Ope?  Ope, I want to congratulate you on your new balls.  Why am I new ones?  I don't know, man.  And I'm a little disappointed in you, man.  What?  And when he hung up the first time, you were digging into him, man.  Then he called back.  You should have fired right at him, man. 
[02:36:30]  Dude, listen to me on this.  First of all, it's the Opey and Anthony show, and I went.  That's all that is.  If I didn't go, I'd guarantee my pal here Ant was going.  You know what makes good radio?  I beat him to the punch because we were both to the point we had it.  You know what makes good radio?  Two people not yelling over each other, especially when a third is on the phone.  What we identify and know what to do, when one person's speaking, the other person has  to back off because you don't want to hear this.  Go ahead, Ope.  Just say anything.  Hey, Tommy, what the hell is it? 
[02:37:00]  You know something?  You don't want to talk about anything.  All righty, thanks.  You were told.  You were told not to call this program with those words.  He could have even said pending litigation.  Perhaps that would have, you know, okay.  And use that one.  Pending litigation.  Well, for you, when I was trying to, because I had a job to do when you were going through  your mess.  I was prying you to see how far he could get you to go.  And on the air, I would say, because it's true, it was, you know, pending litigation.  Perhaps there's some kind of lawsuits being filed that he can't talk about. 
[02:37:30]  I don't know.  Unless he tells us, you know, what do we know?  We're going to talk about it.  The guy doesn't understand that after Motley Crue, the biggest thing he's known for is  a porno movie with his ex-wife, Pamela.  That's the biggest goddamn thing.  Hey, here's some excitement.  Tommy Lee.  Never a dull moment.  The name of the new CD.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Vogue.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  1027.  WNEW. 
[02:38:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  23 Skidoo.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, where's Spaz?  Spaz has to get over here.  He started telling me something during a commercial break, and I'm just like, no, no.  We need this on the air.  Spaz always trying to educate us, Opie. 
[02:38:30]  Yes.  So he was trying to enlighten me on, I don't know.  I'm hearing rumors about something that happened to you on the streets today.  I was walking into the building today, and something wet was hitting my head.  Something wet was hitting your head?  Yes.  And what do you think this wetness was?  Well, I looked up at the sky, and there was no clouds where I was standing.  Right.  And there was nobody, like, squeegeeing the windows, so I was just wondering where it 
[02:39:00]  was coming from.  And it wasn't a bird.  It was just dripping all over my jacket, my book bag, and my head.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Yeah.  And what do you think it is now?  Because I heard some people helped you out with what was going on up in the sky.  It could be somebody was leaking off the roof or out the window.  And you're taking a leak.  A little warning to your fellow New Yorkers.  Do you honestly believe someone was taking a leak on you?  But that was the explanation that I got.  I didn't know what happened.  And somebody told me that I was taking a leak. 
[02:39:30]  There's probably 20 explanations before that, that I would think of, before someone f***ed  you in a building where the windows don't open.  That's the only explanation I got.  I don't know how else.  So, Ant will wreck it.  Uh-uh.  That's just Ant's opinion.  I want you to have the spaz opinion.  What you think happened to you today.  And what you could say to your fellow New Yorkers to warn them against this atrocity. 
[02:40:00]  What?  You washed your hair three times in the bathroom?  Yes.  Which I didn't really want to do because when I wash it, it gets fluffy.  Poofy.  A poofy.  Now, wow, I'm amazed.  Someone f***ed my head out of the building where the windows don't open.  This building, right?  And it could have been a construction site.  You know.  When was this now?  Yesterday?  This morning. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, this morning.  Look at his hair.  It's all poofy.  It gets poofy when I wet it.  I had it flattened.  It gets wavy, too.  Can I?  I have to give you at least three other things it could have been.  I mean, I.  No, and if you're going to do that, then let him do his rant first.  Okay.  I can't do the rant right now.  I got to do it tomorrow.  I got to build up more anger.  God, I got to.  You got to build up more anger.  You're convinced someone f***ed on your head and you need to build up more anger? 
[02:41:00]  What's the problem?  Who are these people f***ing on your head?  Who do you believe they are?  You got to have an idea.  Some kids might go.  I know people like to play pranks.  Some kids might go up to the top of the roof and say, you know, hey, I'm going to w*** in somebody's head.  How many?  Are there possibly 40 floors on this building?  It's a 40-story building that we're in.  They might have good aiming.  They use smart m***h. 
[02:41:30]  Like you see in Baghdad.  The missiles, remember those?  That went down the air conditioning shaft?  They have smart penises.  It could be construction workers.  Construction workers on the roof of the building.  They said, hey, look, there's spaz, 40 stories down.  I'm going to take a leak, compensate for wind, all kinds of stuff.  Wind eddies off the building, altitude, and I'm going to p*** them.  And you've got to realize they're going to have to lead their leak because you're walking. 
[02:42:00]  No, what I did was because I felt the drip, so I stopped and I looked up.  Let me tell you something.  A frigging bathtub of water dropped off a 40-story building, you might feel a drop.  You might feel a drop on you.  A bathtub full of water.  The dispersal, it would be amazing.  Maybe it was a giant mosquito.  Oh, that could be.  His venom.  All right, spaz, you need to rant about this problem here.  So who do you think this is, what it is, and why did it? 
[02:42:30]  You must have felt very angry.  Is it some type of conspiracy?  You must have felt violated.  No, it's just that it was very weird.  I was walking here and there were some clouds here, but then I stopped and in one place there  was no clouds.  It was like a circle around a bright blue sky.  Oh, like the eye of a storm almost.  And then all of a sudden, that's when I felt the drips.  And you felt drips.  Underneath that one spot.  How much?  Politics and socks.  He's as dumb as a box of rocks.  His lips are sagging when he tries to talk. 
[02:43:00]  This is it, the Weekend Review is sad.  You dumb f***.  That's pretty good.  Look at that, you got a little jingle.  You got a jingle for your Weekend Review starting tomorrow.  Now, how much actual liquid was on you?  I got to know.  Well, I saw spotty stuff on my leather coat.  A couple of spots on your leather coat.  Yes.  And then my hair was a little bit drenched.  It was like a little bit like a little wet. 
[02:43:30]  Damn.  Damn.  Over your entire head?  Yeah.  Well, actually, it dripped down like the back of my neck just a little bit.  Do you understand that we did have some rain this morning?  I felt some raindrops.  There was some rain this morning.  But that's the weird part about it.  I specifically went under this circle of blue sky that was...  Do you know how hot...  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  I'm amazed.  What is it?  A cartoon where a cloud goes right over your head and it rains on you? 
[02:44:00]  Don't you think that the clouds surrounding this clear area could pepper you with water?  Rain that maybe is being carried by the wind?  Don't you know those clouds are so high up that you could see a cloud that looks like  it's a mile away above you, but you could be getting hit with the rain from that cloud  because the wind takes it over to you?  There was no wind.  The wind was going maybe one mile away.  Do you know about winds aloft?  Do you know that there are different wind levels?  The wind could be going in a completely different direction, 20,000 feet above your head, 
[02:44:30]  than it is here on the ground where you're protected by buildings and whatnot.  And he believes he got leaked on.  I understand.  I'm going to have to take his side on this one.  Okay, leaked on.  It couldn't possibly be maybe that it was raining.  Maybe...  He says there were no clouds in the area.  Maybe it rained and...  Were there clouds in the sky at all?  There were clouds, but I was under the spot when it was no cloud.  Right.  That magical circle that follows you around.  How about maybe it rained and there was a puddle on the roof of some building and wind blew. 
[02:45:00]  And some of that water was carried and landed on you.  How about air conditioning systems, which leak condensation all over the city?  Sometimes you'll be walking around all of a sudden, there's air conditioning.  And I'm with Spaz.  If he thinks he got leaked on, I have to go with him.  That's just one...  That's one thing that's probably more possible.  I'm not saying that's what it is.  I think he would know if he got f***ed on it.  So what? 
[02:45:30]  So now you're angry and you want to vent about people that f*** you on other people from  great heights?  Stupid!  And now because of that...  You're so stupid!  And now because of that, you had to wash your hair three times and it's now poofy.  It gets poofy every time I wash it.  In a related subject, Spaz, that's not moose in your hair.  I am fascinated by this man.  I am stupefied.  News, politics, and stocks.  He's as dumb as a box of rocks. 
[02:46:00]  His lips are snagging when he tries to talk.  This is it, the Weekend Review is Spaz.  You dumb f***.  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly News.  This just in.  People f***ing on other people in Manhattan.  Unbelievable, the amounts of complaints coming in from people being drenched by f***. 
[02:46:30]  That is being f***ed onto people's heads from great heights.  You may ask yourself, geez, I can't even hit the toilet bowl when I'm standing in my own  bathroom without hitting the rim and getting it all over the seat so the girls complain.  But from 40 stories high above the windy streets of downtown Manhattan, somebody is f***ing on pedestrians. 
[02:47:00]  Tom Broker, NBC Nightly News.  An exclusive story.  People being f***ed.  This is a new form of terrorism in our Paris city, comparable to the World Trade Center bombing.  We now have the World Trade Center f***ing.  People are on the observation deck of the World Trade Center f***ing on people on the West Side Highway.  It's quite amazing.  Let's get this quote from a man on the street that has been f***ed, sir. 
[02:47:30]  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  You heard it here first, folks, on the 10th of America, NBC Nightly News.  Stupid, you're so stupid.  Unbelievable.  How does the stream stay together over 40 stories?  How does wind affect this?  How are they aiming?  We'll have scientists that are educated in fluid technology on the show later to tell us how this works.  Hey, Tom, are you going to explain the theory of the circle? 
[02:48:00]  The clear sky in the middle of the clouds?  Yes, yes, our own weatherman, Mr. G, will be coming on and explaining the strange phenomenon.  Holes in the sky above skies as dead.  Unbelievable cloud formations that keep the skies clear above morons' heads happening in our Paris city. 
[02:48:30]  Tom Brogan, NBC Nightly News.  Tom, maybe it's King Kong taking a f***ing gun, everybody.  Oh, I never thought of that.  We'll send a camera crew right now to the Empire State Building.  God checking in.  God?  Hello, boys.  How are you today?  Pretty good.  Hello, God.  Even God has a bad car phone.  I thought he would get the good one, but I guess not.  Hi, God.  I'm calling to let you know that I f***ed Kevin's head, because I cannot even forgive him for being so eff***ing stupid. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  Thank you, God.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hey, it's funny, fast.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Come on! 
[02:49:30]  Come on!  It won't be long until you have the next steps up to you. 
[02:50:00]  Whoa!  Whoa!  Stupid!  Whoa!  Stupid!  Whoa!  Come on! 
[02:50:30]  Come on!  Tom Brokaw, MBT Nightly News.  In this segment, Urine from the Sky.  A new form of terrorism sweeping the city. 
[02:51:00]  Young vandals 40 stories up,  f***ing on pedestrians.  We'll have Mayor Guggennie's response to this later.  Remember, that's the big story tonight.  The funniest part of that whole thing was it sped up like that.  Rain drops keep falling on my head.  There was no wind.  I didn't feel anything whistling through my ears.  Spaz, you don't seem amused at this point. 
[02:51:30]  You okay?  It's a serious subject.  Very serious.  You're an extreme terrorist.  High above our city.  Perhaps even using enemy aircraft.  Perhaps not even in buildings.  Perhaps they're hiding in the landing gears of airplanes.  Spaz, out of these three things,  tell me which is the most serious, okay?  Giant mosquitoes attacking our fine city.  Yes.  Cancerous live wires.  Or people f***ing on your head as you're trying to walk to work. 
[02:52:00]  Which would be the most serious of the three?  I would have to say the cancerous live wires.  Okay.  Cancerous live wires.  All right.  By the way, thank you for the cancerous live wires window decals.  That's so much said, Todd.  Yeah, you see that?  It's got cancerous live wires.  And then the red circle with the slash throw.  We've been getting a pretty good laugh out of those.  So thank you for sending those into the show.  All right.  What would be the second most serious out of the three?  I would have to say the mosquito. 
[02:52:30]  Giant mosquito.  All right.  And then so f***ing on your head really doesn't seem that bad.  It's more of a moral matter.  There it is.  Colonel Tibbetts in the Enola J.  Flying above the city of New York.  A fuselage belly laden with urine.  Spraying it down on unsrespecting pedestrians.  This could bring an end to the war.  Colonel Tibbetts rolling down the runway. 
[02:53:00]  The implement of destruction.  Tanks and tanks of urine in her belly.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Lo, what's up?  Oh, God.  Are you killing me?  Now I know why you keep Spaz on.  No one that stupid can be allowed to run out into the public.  It's amazing.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe how dumb the guy is.  Spaz, did you ever hear of something called a sun shower?  Oh, my God.  A sun shower.  And what is a sun shower? 
[02:53:30]  Sun shower.  A sun shower is when there are very little white clouds.  I believe they're the cumulus clouds or the stratos.  They're around the sun.  What?  Wait a minute.  The clouds are where?  Around the sun?  Around the sun?  It looks like that.  How far from the sun would you say these clouds are?  I really don't know.  I would say eons.  Eons?  Eons is a time frame, not a distance.  That's a Chevy Chase reference, you idiot. 
[02:54:00]  I didn't know that.  You're ripping off Chevy Chase.  I didn't know.  That guy's going to come in here and be drunk.  So now, a sun shower, you look up, and are you saying that you see clouds when there's  a sun shower?  Yes, but they're whitish, not so grayish clouds.  But the shower that there was, there was a center where there was just a blue sky.  Holy mother of God.  So it can't possibly rain from a blue sky.  Wow.  Of course it can.  It's blue.  There's nothing.  There's no clouds to rain.  It's blue.  Oh, my God. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  This is impossible.  He walks and breathes, so there's got to be something in there, at least for involuntary  actions.  Is there just like a medulla?  Doesn't, isn't that just control like heart rate and breathing to make sure you just don't  drop dead?  People can live without brains, right?  People live in hospitals and breathe and live quite well, but they're brain dead. 
[02:55:00]  Brain dead people can still breathe.  Thank you, Steve.  I was very curious into that.  Oh, my God.  Dude, it is totally possible for it to be sprinkling on you when you look up and see complete blue  skies and sun just shining.  How?  Where's the rain coming from?  It can't be coming from the sun.  It could.  Yes, it can.  No, no.  It can rain.  First of all, it could be from clouds that you are seeing way away from you. 
[02:55:30]  The winds are bringing the water to you.  Winds aloft.  Also, water can just condense in the air without forming clouds.  Or it could be blue ice from those jets flushing their toilets.  So maybe you're right.  You did get some on your head.  Whoa.  Okay.  I just need the peace of talking to the sun.  Okay.  And I said I didn't like the way he got tased up.  Stop it.  Stop it.  The rain drops are rolling on my head. 
[02:56:00]  They can call it.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Don't eat the brown snow, Spaz.  What was that? 
[02:56:30]  Amelia.  Amelia, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  Is he for real, this guy?  I just can't even believe that you would think that he got done.  I got to tell you, I was outside having a cigarette break today and I looked up and out  of a clear blue sky, I'm getting spritzed on.  And now I realized there was a construction site close by and I was probably being spritzed  with you.  See?  I mean, you know, I'm glad that he exposed this because now I know to be careful when I'm  walking the streets of Manhattan. 
[02:57:00]  Well, there you have it.  Deadly urine-throwing terrorists in New York City.  Could this be spreading to other major metropolitan areas in our country?  Stay tuned to NBC Nightly News as we continue with Urine from the Sky.  Special report.  Unbelievable.  Did you ever p*** off a roof of a house even?  But it's like, or any altitude, maybe rocks on a jetty at the beach or something. 
[02:57:30]  I mean, pee at any altitude.  It's just beside itself.  Do you see the breakup of the, you don't have laser beams coming out of there?  It disperses, it just, by the time it hits the ground from 40 floors, it looks like a  perfume out of an atomizer.  It's gone.  There weren't thick drops.  Just when you thought he wasn't. 
[02:58:00]  I'm amazed.  The clouds around the sun and the eons away from us.  Okay, thank you, Spice.  Wow!  Whore.  This Thursday.  Filthy whore.  Sex for Sam.  Three.  The Opian Anthony Show. </pre>
