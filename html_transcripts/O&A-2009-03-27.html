<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing their vehement displeasure about their impending move to a new, smaller SiriusXM studio, believing it a cost-cutting measure.  They jokingly planned a celebratory bus ride and a "welcome party" to the new "Howard Stern Memorial Building," lamenting the increased interaction with other SiriusXM personalities they anticipated, particularly mandatory meetings.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a "Let's Make a Deal"-style giveaway of bizarre items from their current office: a poorly painted nude woman, a Don Wicklund-designed shirt, and an Alien Ant Farm autographed skateboard. A caller suggested a humorous entrance to the new studio using a boombox and a Jay Leno clip.  The hosts discussed their strained relationship with other SiriusXM personalities, including Ron and Fez, contrasting their studio situation with Opie and Anthony's perceived demotion.  They also highlighted their close relationship with listeners, expressing concern about losing that connection.  A recurring joke involved a listener from Philadelphia who brought a large quantity of food and had to wait outside. The segment included numerous off-color jokes, sexual innuendo, and references to popular culture, punctuated by a brief call from SiriusXM employee Mark Strucker offering suggestions and an unexpected interruption from staff member David bringing food. A picture of one of the hosts in a revealing outfit also sparked humorous commentary. The segment ended with further complaints about the move and perceived lack of management appreciation.


The show continued with a description of a large, predominantly female crowd outside the studio.  The hosts then unsuccessfully attempted to reach several people by phone: Sam Roberts, Derek, and E-Rocs.  A news report showing a woman fainting on live television provided comedic fodder. The conversation then shifted to a previous interview with Ray Liotta, where Liotta's concern for Jim Norton's quiet demeanor was revealed to be due to Norton having a twisted testicle, sparking a lengthy, graphic discussion about the condition and its treatment.  A significant portion focused on criticizing Bob Kelly's excessive tweeting, resulting in the hosts blocking him on Twitter.  They also discussed a multi-million dollar lawsuit stemming from secret taping during their previous employment at N.E.W., expressing paranoia about potential bugs in their new building.  Eastside Dave's drunken, incoherent voicemails for Sam Roberts were played, along with a description of Dave's habit of scavenging leftover food.  The hosts discussed a news story about a 14-year-old girl facing child pornography charges and another about a teenager painting a penis on his parents' roof.  A phone call with Ron Bennington to the Sam and Dave show was played, highlighting the dynamic between the hosts and the newer show's hosts.  Jeffrey Ross was mentioned as a guest.


Comedian Jeffrey Ross appeared as a guest, discussing his recent roast of Larry the Cable Guy and appearance at the Stress Factory.  The conversation then turned to a critical and highly offensive discussion of Kristen, Elliot Spitzer's madam, for unprofessional conduct.  A Starbucks employee's limited vacation time sparked a discussion about the treatment of Starbucks employees and coffee quality.  The hosts extensively planned and rehearsed their "Let's Make a Deal" giveaway of office belongings, incorporating numerous digressions and off-color jokes.  The segment featured comedic attempts at emulating the game show, a "paddle" system to regulate on-air behavior, and improvisation.  The show concluded with continued preparation for the giveaway, a clip of Jeffrey Ross roasting Larry the Cable Guy, and a discussion about the firing of Des Moines radio personalities for on-air profanity.


This segment focused on the impending end of the show and the planned "Opie and Anthony Variety Show" for their final live broadcast.  The hosts discussed the recent firing of unnamed individuals, speculating it was a Friday firing. They brainstormed acts for the variety show, including musical numbers (possibly featuring Eastside Dave on a unicycle), comedy sketches, and a "coochie-coochie girl."  Jeffrey Ross participated in the planning.  Patty attempted (and failed) to sing Rush's "Tom Sawyer," leading to jokes about her performance and visible nipples.  The segment included further complaints about the upcoming studio move and anxieties about the transition.  Jimmy was preparing for a TV shoot, leading to jokes about their waning popularity.  The "Let's Make a Deal" segment continued, featuring prizes including a needlepoint of a nude woman and a Larry the Cable Guy DVD. The show concluded with "Big A and Twitchell's News," highlighting Twitchell's Tourette's Syndrome, crude humor, and a phone call from Eastside Dave making threats against Ray Liotta.


The show featured Lewis Twitchell, accused of being a "traitor" for appearing on "Miserable Men."  They reminisced about a past incident involving a paddle and Jenga.  The hosts and Twitchell engaged in playful insults, referencing physical appearances and disabilities.  A recurring news segment featuring Twitchell and Opie ("Big A") delivered comically nonsensical news stories.  Twitchell participated in a bit where he reacted to the song "Jump Around," leading to a chaotic scene.  Giveaways to the studio audience included shirts, an Alien Ant Farm skateboard, a needlepoint of a naked woman, a Frank Sinatra portrait, and a Grand Theft Auto game.  Twitchell promoted his stand-up shows.  Patty's failed attempt to sing Rush was followed by Evan Champion's successful performance.  The show transitioned to "The David and Bobo Show," initially hesitant to incorporate the "Big A and Twitchels" angle.  The segment featured discussions of Bobo's success, listener calls, including offensive jokes about David's family and inbreeding, a discussion of the MTA fare increase, Governor Patterson, and other topical news.


The "David and Bobo Show" segment compared Bobo's recent success to Twitchell's longer career, with playful (and vulgar) banter and insults directed at Twitchell, including homophobic slurs.  A caller made a crude joke about David's family, and another asked if he was inbred, leading to further insults.  A listener questioned Bobo's Twitter popularity compared to Twitchell's. Another caller made a bread joke about David, leading to discussion of a rumor about David being inbred, which he vehemently denied. The segment concluded with Club Soda Kenny gifting Bobo a new XM radio, Bobo offering Kenny pizza in return, and promotions of social media handles and upcoming gigs, ending with a final vulgar insult to Twitchell.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  There we go. Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Ready to broadcast.  We are broadcasting, my friend. We are broadcasting.  You can feel the excitement in the air. 
[00:00:30]  Jimmy just farted. That wasn't the excitement.  That's one of the signs.  He's frightened.  We pulled up around, I don't know what, 5.15 or something this morning.  And there was a listener outside already with lots of food from Philly.  Lots of food.  Yeah, I saw that guy.  You can feel it. There's a week left in this joint.  I gotta sit down.  What?  Oh, good God.  I like to stand sometimes, get the energy going.  And then I realized, oh my God, we got a week left in this joint. 
[00:01:00]  Why?  A week.  This isn't a trash management segment, trust me.  But as the days are numbered, I just don't get why we have to leave this amazing facility.  I know they're trying to do the right thing over there, but guess what?  It's not anything like what we have over here.  It's nothing but a money saving thing.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with like, hey, we'd like you guys over there and stuff.  I just don't buy that. 
[00:01:30]  They keep spinning.  It's going to be good for you guys.  It'll be great.  Within these hallways, you'll be able to interact with other shows.  The glass hallways?  Yeah.  It'll be easier to get guests on your show.  And, you know, just a little chit-chat.  You're chit-chatting with this guy from this channel and he's got this guest.  I don't chit-chat.  Thank you.  You watch.  They're going to be taking us in and out of that place like we're the president of the United States,  draping us so no one gets a look at us.  Drape us all the way into our studio.  The shades go down. 
[00:02:00]  We broadcast, end of show, drape us until we hit the elevator back.  You honestly think?  What?  What happened?  I know what this is going to be.  This is going to be daily shit meetings.  Daily shit meetings.  We're going to have to sit there and since we're in the same building and, you know.  It's an easy excuse to get together, right?  To be like, hey, guys, after the show, you got five minutes?  No.  No, we don't. 
[00:02:30]  I don't.  No, no, no.  You know the difference five minutes makes with my traffic?  That's what I'll say.  Five minutes so you can tell us other things you might do eventually?  That's a good shot right there.  What else?  They're going to snatch away from us?  I disagree.  I think there's going to be a big welcome party.  Yeah.  Welcome party.  That's right.  A band.  You know what I would like?  Guess what, Ant?  I would like a bus to take us from here over to the Sirius facility. 
[00:03:00]  One of those tour buses.  Right.  Like the Apple tour buses.  Right.  Where we're on top waving to the crowd.  Yeah.  No, huh?  Can I...  Where's the countdown to our going into the building?  Before I continue, I need a paddle.  Let's make believe this is a Brazilian steak place.  I'm going to give the paddle to Anthony.  Yes.  And if I get a little too saucy with management and their treatment, you lift up the red paddle, 
[00:03:30]  and that means I got to stop.  Well, that's a good one.  Because I got a few things I want to say.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I might have to paddle myself to tell you the truth.  Good to see that you're willing to paddle yourself.  It's just, you know, it's just...  I know it's a money-making thing, a money-saving thing.  I know everybody's, you know, crying poverty these days and with good reason.  But there are certain things that are worth it. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  Not that I'm making a last plea to save this place.  Believe me, I know it's over, Johnny.  Right.  But it's like, you know, we have our own thing going here.  I kind of like being the outsiders kind of a thing.  And to put us in that building, which pretty much is...  It's the Howard Stern Memorial building over there.  I mean, you can't walk around.  If the hallway isn't...  Or if the office doesn't have glass in it on the walls or something,  it's some kind of, you know, 
[00:04:30]  that black fist being held up with the Howard channels or whatever it is on the windows.  Are we joining the revolution?  Yeah, we're going to have to, like, plaster that all over our windows and stuff.  Do we have to wear the uniform every day?  Like the rest of those freaks over there?  And again, it's not an issue like,  like, oh, it sucks to do radio for them,  or this guy's an asshole, or that...  It's just, we're very comfortable here being on the fringe. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  We're a fringe kind of guy.  We like doing our own thing.  Yeah.  I know the listeners out there, the, I don't know, whatever.  They like to say, oh, they learned everything.  Listener voice, here it comes.  They learned everything they know from Howard Stern.  They copy him!  Yeah.  No, we don't, actually.  We've always done our own thing.  You stole my voice, Robin.  Right.  One of the guys actually stole my voice.  If you really listen to the two shows, there's big differences. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, he's great and you suck!  Yeah, all right.  There you go.  Now you don't have to write that one.  Jesus, shut up.  If we suck, why have we been at this for 15 years, you idiot?  Why don't you just do the...  Bamboozling people?  Yeah.  But there are major differences.  Major!  And one of them, and this is why I'm bummed, is the interaction with our fans.  Yeah.  Howard doesn't interact with anybody.  He barely interacts with his own family.  We have listeners every day hanging with us. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Giving us material.  Giving us food.  Giving us gifts.  And it all goes away.  And you try to tell these guys over there, like, this is really important to us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  No, you don't got it, because it's going away, and this is going to hurt our show.  It's something that is what we're all about.  We've always interacted with our fans.  There's guys waiting outside to get in already, and we're just...  I got it.  And we're trying to, like, make them wait until 6.30 or 7. 
[00:06:30]  They want to come up already.  Yeah.  And for anybody who thinks that we haven't poured this speech on management...  I got it, guy.  Yeah.  No, we have.  It fell on deaf ears, pretty much.  All of it has.  Everything we say has fallen on deaf ears.  I know.  It's so frustrating.  They're taking this away.  And it's like the same old crap, like, oh, it's only one little thing.  No, the little things are adding up, which makes us what we are. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  You just keep ripping up little things.  I don't know.  Yeah, I kind of like not being in that building.  I don't know the fucking building.  Jesus Christ, that building.  So the reason I'm sitting down is because I just realized a week from today is our last  show in front of a live audience.  A week from today, that is it.  Yeah.  Because people are confused.  It's a week from today.  Right.  And the audiences are building because they really... 
[00:07:30]  There are people, because we only told them very recently that this is going away.  Yeah.  There are people that are flying in from all over the country just to see the show live.  Not bad for a show that sucks and, you know, doesn't know what they're doing.  It's like a Broadway show that's closing.  Yeah.  They all, you know.  Yeah.  They all come to see it.  And that leads to the other thing.  We have decided, and this is brand new, so listen up.  We have decided to pretty much give away our office.  Yes.  Oh, the stuff we have collected over the years. 
[00:08:00]  Let me tell you me.  I am going to take a picture of the first bunch of stuff we are giving away right to  the listeners today.  And this is going to happen starting today all the way through next Friday.  Yes.  With the live audience that is here.  As I take a picture, you want to explain some of the stuff you see, Anthony?  Oh, Opie, what I'm seeing over here is a virtual treasure trove of riches from our  office.  I see a shitty snowboard or skateboard without wheels. 
[00:08:30]  I see a wow hard hat that has just been an albatross in our office for years.  Why is that still here?  I'm amazed by things that are still here.  Like, I remember when that came in, everyone goofed on it, like, what the fuck are you going  to do with this?  And then it just stayed there in the office for this occasion, I guess.  I'm looking at a horrible picture. 
[00:09:00]  I don't know if it's needlepoint or a painting.  That's Derek's painting.  Of a nude woman, the shadowing and proportions of which are horrid.  It is somebody that might have wanted to be a painter or an artist and just fell miserably  at it.  He rocked.  And of course, from Frank's place, from Frank's place.  Right.  A much too big picture of Frank Sinatra holding a drink, giving that devilish grin of his. 
[00:09:30]  The shocker foam hand from Grand Theft Auto.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  A bunch of t-shirts.  The Don Wicklund shirt that Don Wicklund went out of his way to make for everybody and  not one person has worn theirs.  No.  Well, no.  Maybe I should say that.  One person did.  Who?  Who?  Master Poe.  Oh, Master Poe liked it? 
[00:10:00]  Master Poe wore that, I think, for a month straight.  Well, what?  Exactly.  Those Don Wicklund shirts that Don Wicklund made up.  These gas station style shirts that had your name embroidered on it?  Yeah.  He also wore ones from the staff that didn't want to wear theirs.  He took those to them.  Yes, of course.  It was a nice idea from...  Today, I am Sam.  It was a nice idea from Don, but guess what?  We never wore your dumb shirts.  Let's be honest with them.  Didn't it say staff on it?  No, ours had our name.  I never wear anything that has my name on it. 
[00:10:30]  It had the name, but the tag was stupid with the name.  It was like it had material flopping off of it or something.  It's edgy.  Would you have to rip that off or something?  Well, he didn't have a big budget, Anthony.  No.  That stunk.  And an Alien Ant Farm board.  What is that?  Is that a skateboard without wheels or a snowboard?  It's a skateboard.  It's autographed.  By Alien Ant Farm themselves?  Yeah.  Wow!  Wow!  And don't even think...  Get that fucking King of Comedy poster off the wall. 
[00:11:00]  Well, that is mine.  That is going in my theater.  Where's the King of Comedy poster?  For real.  It's on the wall.  It's on the wall still.  By my old desk.  Oh, right.  Okay.  That's the only good thing in that fucking office.  Right.  That was off the wall.  It was high enough off the floor where the mice and rats didn't nibble at it.  Everything else, I think, might be nibbled.  Is that it, Daniel?  Yes.  Look at that.  That's fucking rocks.  Yep.  That'll go a bit in the bar area, I think.  Oh, man.  Can I have an ant? 
[00:11:30]  Big Kev gave that to me.  No, he didn't.  He gave it to us.  It was a show.  Yeah, he gave it to us.  No, he did.  Don't lie.  It was mine.  It was my birthday present.  Rock, paper, scissors for it.  Come on.  No!  Three-way tournament.  Let's go.  No.  Jimmy and I want it, too.  But HK40 Cal, paper, scissors.  Mine!  Well, so, the days are numbered.  Yep.  And no one's talking, so I'm sure half the staff will be gone by the time we start broadcasting. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, my God.  We don't know who's coming or going.  Because they can't even give us a straight answer on that.  We already know the answer.  We're not sure.  Why don't you just tell us?  You're going to strip this down to the...  Oh, shit.  I brought in a mini laptop, and Mars, I think, just hit it with a sledgehammer.  This is my sledgehammer.  This is going with me.  Because you never know what you might want to break.  By the way, someone has a great idea.  Really?  Yeah, they really do.  It's not in this room.  Mark the Strucker. 
[00:12:30]  Hey, Mark.  What's going on?  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  What's your book?  Oh, thank you.  Just the idea is you guys walk in together into the new facility and have Sam or somebody  walk in in front of you with a ghetto blaster, playing the Jay Leno clip over and over and  over again.  That would be fucking funny.  Should we give that job to E-Rock?  He can walk in with the boombox just blasting the Jay Leno intro to Jimmy.  What was that movie?  Was it Say Anything, the boombox over the head, John Cusack with the trench coat? 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  We got to have someone dressed like that every day.  Maybe one of our interns.  And they lead the parade to our studio with that clip with the boombox over their head.  Perfect.  Actually, in a new rule, if you work for the Opie and Anthony show, the Jay Leno clip  where he says that we're the most popular radio show in the history of satellite radio  has to be on everyone's phone as their ringtone.  Wow.  So as that thing rings, business calls coming in throughout the day, and our guys will be  spread out through the facility, people are going to be seeing that. 
[00:13:30]  They'll hear it.  Who's going to be the first to put it on their phone?  Phone.  Well, I have my ringtones that came with my phone.  I understand.  Yeah, Nick in Pennsylvania.  How are you, Nick?  Yeah, how are you doing, guys?  Good.  I was listening to a Howard replay just the other day, and they had a big deal.  It was like an all-day discussion because one of the interns or someone on Howard's staff 
[00:14:00]  forgot to close the door to the green room when Howard was walking by, and he had to,  God forbid, see some of the guests.  See, I mean, there are obvious differences between the two shows.  I know.  It's hard to get interns for both shows that are good, though, apparently.  We interact with the guests.  We interact with the listeners.  We're little social butterflies around here.  We barely have time to do a radio show.  We're too busy socializing.  I think you guys are wrong, though. 
[00:14:30]  I'm telling you, they're planning some kind of big shindig for the show.  Oh, boy.  We're going to walk into glory.  I love that Jimmy still has a little twinkle in his eye.  Aw, it is sweet and naive to see.  How many years are you in?  About five, since sometime at the end of 2001.  So, all right.  Right around the 10-year mark, you just lose all hope.  So, you're about, you've got another year, year and a half.  I'm telling you guys.  We're going to ride that year and a half with you and just see that little tinkle in your eye,  feeling the sunshine in your soul.  Tinkle in his eye.  That's what he's used to, though. 
[00:15:00]  You're right.  That does make sense.  Sort of a Freudian slip.  Of course, talking about the twinkle in his eye, but he does like a little tinkle, too.  We're going to walk in, and Steve Blatter's going to open the door like Fredo.  And we're going to walk in, and the band's going to go,  We're going to go, Steve, what is this?  That's for you to find out.  Welcome, boys.  I'm thinking Pesce and Goodfell's myself.  Dry insults for the whole show. 
[00:15:30]  A little Pesce, Goodfellas.  Oh, no.  I wonder what the song, because I imagine they're going to have some kind of a welcome Opie and Anthony show song prepared.  Oh, please.  I'm sure.  I don't know what that will be.  I don't doubt that for a second.  They'll probably have, if they do anything, a banner, a stupid banner, and a couple people have noisemakers, and then they'll go,  No.  And then the banner will fall off the wall.  I, I, yeah.  The banner will fall off the wall if there would be a banner, but there's never going to be a banner. 
[00:16:00]  Would we get in trouble if we had a band lead us in?  Like a small band, like one guy with a drum in front of them, and some guy playing the horn.  You know what the cymbals?  Yeah.  All right.  Stupid trombone.  Trombone.  Yeah.  Could you stop it?  You know, we would get yelled at for that.  There are people trying to work, and you guys come in with a banner.  You know, you should have run that past us.  Yeah, a little spontaneity, you know? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Well, guess what?  I hope you're prepared for the O&A crew, because we're a unique bunch.  That's all right.  We're unique, just like every soldier or every potential Marine that pulls into Paris Island.  Yeah.  You know, we think we're independent and stuff, and in no time we're beaten down by the drill sergeants.  But do you understand that this show is the outcasts?  Like, that company has been there, and whatever they got with the people they got, they're all in the same building, and they see us as the dicks. 
[00:17:00]  Like, we're the fucking guys across that really, we're attacking them a lot.  Yeah.  And we're just being dicks for a long time.  We have to, yeah, we have to move in with them.  Yeah.  Yeah, and now we have to show up.  Hi.  How you doing?  Yeah, and we've made fun of the dog symbol for a few years.  The doggy symbol.  Now I like it.  They were explaining our new area to me yesterday, and it actually was said,  and there's computers in kind of like the hallway where the interns could.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great. 
[00:17:30]  Isn't it?  Wonderful.  Right outside the office there'll be some computers that, you know, you guys could use.  Yeah, yeah, we could use common computers that other people, we might have to go, excuse me.  And they even said, you know, if interns or stuff are on there from other shows, and they're doing things,  you could just tell them, hey, hey.  Yeah, great.  That makes for a comfortable working atmosphere.  Yeah, wonderful.  Hey, plebe, beat it.  Right.  I got to look up some pornography.  Let's say, this is funny, Sean in Virginia. 
[00:18:00]  Sean.  Yeah.  How are you, Sean?  Good, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  I figured over at Sirius there, it's going to be like Blazing Saddles when the new sheriff shows.  Yeah.  The new show is a bong.  Yeah.  We'll pretty much get the same welcome.  All right, tapping out, guys.  No, we're not taking three weeks off a month like Howard does.  Oh.  The Pest, they want to know if they could just come to the building every morning.  Oh, yeah, that'll work.  Stalker Patty, will she be part of the serious thing? 
[00:18:30]  I'm sure she'll figure out how to get in the building.  I'm sure.  She always does.  Oh, yeah, there you are.  Let's say hi to Greg on Long Island.  Greg.  Greg.  Two things.  You can have two beautiful women walk in front of you and throw rose petals at your feet.  Oh.  Like in Coming to America, Coming to Sirius.  I almost like the idea, but beautiful women, I'm going to have to put the kibosh on that. 
[00:19:00]  Like, I say a couple of giant fatos.  Trannies.  A couple of pigs.  Jesus Christ.  Ant.  Trannies.  Either trannies or big fat girls.  Yeah.  Hot chicks.  Nah.  Slobs.  A couple of disasters.  Throwing rose petals.  When we get there at five in the morning, there's going to be no one there.  No, I mean, like, as we leave.  As we leave.  You know how I picture the Sirius studios, like the last scene in Rages of the Lost Ark? 
[00:19:30]  Thank you.  Thank you, Greg.  Okay.  All right.  No equipment, I guess.  Is this true?  Chris in Syracuse.  Chris, how are you?  Good.  I was perusing through the XM channels the other day and came across channel 98.  They said they were going to be right next, the gay channel, said they were going to be  right next door to you guys, and the one girl said the cute one likes us, and the faggot  says which one's the cute one, and the bot there says whichever one likes us, and they 
[00:20:00]  said they're going to bring you muffins and shit whenever you move in.  Yeah, I do believe the gay channel's right next to us.  We were told that already.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I was.  Yeah, whatever.  You think they're going to do a fuckish in the mouth, they'll probably say hi, and  we'll say hi.  Yeah, whatever.  Lucky devil.  They're not going to run next door while we're doing the show.  Hi, we're gay!  All naked.  What is it, a sitcom?  Yeah, we don't give a shit.  The gay neighbors are going to come by over-the-top gay, making cake.  Yeah.  Like, we'll come into the studio.  Curtains? 
[00:20:30]  Who hung curtains in our studio?  Hi!  Oh, it's the gay show.  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Oh, no.  Where's Travis?  He went to the bathroom, and they started fucking his...  What?  Oh, they didn't.  Oh, no.  Oh, who's at the door of the studio?  Oh, it's the gay guys!  And then they applause, and they'll bring brownies for us.  They got us in a weird area.  We got the gays right next door as our neighbors, and across the street, we got the blacks.  Oh, the hip-hop guys are... 
[00:21:00]  We got the blacks across the street.  Across the street, yeah.  The street.  Across the hallway.  That's the street.  The street, yeah.  So down the street, we got the gay guys.  Not even down, right next door.  Right next door from us.  Our next-door neighbors, our wacky neighbors are the gay guys and the hip-hop gangsters.  Yeah.  And us.  So we got to make friends with the black guys across the street.  You know what our part of the building is?  It's that little outcast room from Animal House that they sent the pledges to, that they 
[00:21:30]  didn't want, where they sent Flounder and Pinto to.  And you remember, Ahmad and...  Right.  Ugh.  Oh, outcast.  Wonderful.  God.  Is there a way to get back there without having to pass by anybody?  Like, I don't even know all the entrances to that building.  I know there's that sort of.  Yeah?  Sort of.  You can make it a...  Yeah.  Kind of, actually.  It matters.  This whole place is fucking glass. 
[00:22:00]  The crystal city.  Yeah.  Hey, man, I fought.  I'm like, this place is too small for what we do.  Well, we just want to get you in the building.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  No, but really, it's going to hurt the show.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  No, we just need you to get in the building, and then we can figure something out.  We got it.  We got it.  You've been around long enough to know that you say, just get inside the building, and  then we'll figure out.  That means maybe years down the road, you will do something nice for us. 
[00:22:30]  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  AIDS!  I hope that's what you mean.  I got to turn my paddle over.  What?  I got it.  I got it.  I didn't mention anybody.  I got it.  A bunch of people say that.  What?  A bunch of people go, I got it.  Everyone says that.  I got it.  Come and speak.  Yes.  Yay!  I'm a big fan of, don't tell us anything if you can't do anything.  Right.  I've always been a fan of that. 
[00:23:00]  Just tell me there's not much you can do for us.  Don't the first meeting you have with us tell us that we were underappreciated and under-marketed  by XM, and then a mere eight to ten months later, there's still nothing going on.  Right.  Not only that, you're taking stuff away from the show, which makes it harder for us to  do our jobs.  So just tell us that's how it is.  Who's saying that?  Ron and Fez are not going to the new place? 
[00:23:30]  What?  Where are they going?  They're going to the new place.  Believe me.  Are they going to be holdouts?  They're going to get hit in the head with a wrecking ball is what will happen.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  They want to take this building down eventually.  They're closing.  It's, you know, look, financially, if you have a building down the street, it does make sense  to go, why are they paying rent here for just two shows where they could put them, you  know, I understand that.  I don't like it, but I understand.  Yeah, but we have time on the lease.  That's the argument we had.  Okay.  So let us stay here.  Yeah, yeah.  Until the lease runs out, you know. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  See what happens.  Could you get Danny in here?  I need a password.  When is the lease run out?  Do you know it?  I don't know.  To be honest with you, I've heard different things.  I hope and too.  Then it's got to be the equipment that they want to take.  I hear it's at least another year, right?  Yeah, but they're trying to break it as soon as we're out.  Okay.  Some kind of tax thing that they're working on.  Ah.  But it's financial.  Sure will come out of my pocketbook.  Yeah, we're going to get into that tax thing in a minute or two.  The thing with Ron and Fez was they didn't have an office until recently. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  And it's not even on the same floor as us now.  They have to take two separate elevator banks just to get to the studio.  They wanted to do that with us.  I'm like, why do you want us in your building if we're going to be completely, like, not even anywhere near anybody?  Then you might as well keep us where we are.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're like in the, like I said, the reject section.  Wait, how big would that office have been if we were, if we, if we, if they only have one set of studios, right?  Yeah.  Is there a set of studios on the other floor?  No.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[00:25:00]  But that's what, that's kind of the point we're making.  Like, Ron and Fez are a very important show to satellite radio.  Yeah.  And look how they're being treated.  They've got an office that's what?  They're on the 19th floor and we're on the 36th.  Holy Jesus.  But not only that, I think they're in.  Oh, a different tower.  I think they're in a, sort of, either a different tower or a different elevator bank, so they have to, like.  You'd have to leave Sirius, go down to the lobby.  Right.  Go to the other side of the lobby, take another elevator bank up to the 19th floor. 
[00:25:30]  Right, that's where they're going to be.  Yeah.  I mean, nowhere's near convenient.  No.  So they're just shoving them out of sight, out of mind.  That, that's good.  Not that they're not a good show or nothing.  Send some other idiots down to the 19th floor.  Ron and Fez are, are way more important than just about every effing channel over there.  Yeah, so take somebody.  Take some dumb, who gives a crap channel.  Throw them on the 19th floor.  And do the right thing.  Give it to Ron and Fez.  So now we can't even be near those guys? 
[00:26:00]  We'll never see them.  I know.  God, will you just do the right thing?  Like, you know what?  No crossover stuff and just hanging out?  You know there's a bunch of channels barely hanging on?  You throw those dummies on the 19th floor and give Ron and Fez their office.  Yeah, goodbye.  And tell them this is how it's going to be.  Goodbye.  Why does everything have to be so effing complicated?  My God, it's so basic stuff.  It's no-brainer stuff.  We are the two big shows for XM. 
[00:26:30]  Everyone knows that.  Yeah.  Us and Ron and Fez.  So get Ron and Fez in the main area.  Yeah.  It's a no-brainer.  Yeah.  I can mention a bunch of channels that should be on the 19th floor, but I'll try to be a  company guy.  Look, I raised the red paddle for myself.  Oh, wow.  And the other side is green.  That means just go.  You're fine.  You're green right now, so you can say whatever you want.  I'm green?  Yes.  We're doing Brazilian steakhouse rules today.  I probably shouldn't say.  All right.  You got a red right now. 
[00:27:00]  Just red me.  You got your passwords?  Yeah, working on it.  Let's say hi to Matt in Toronto.  Matt.  Hey, boys.  You're disappointing me.  I love you guys, and you sound a little bit beaten down.  You need to walk in there like you're the new mayor in town, like you're the new boss.  Apparently, he's referencing an old blaxploitation movie.  Yeah, you don't have to dump out of that.  From the 70s. 
[00:27:30]  That's right.  They wouldn't dump that.  Who knows?  Let's say hi to Skip the Trucker.  Skip.  Hey there, Skip.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning, Skip.  I picture you guys walking in there like you're Clarice Starling walking into the lamb farm.  Have the lamb stopped crying, Clarice?  Oh, God.  It's Larice.  He can't get it out.  That's great.  Oh, Jesus.  You stink.  Good job.  You are a bum. 
[00:28:00]  Thank you, Skip.  Bill.  In Alabama.  Where's our cheesesteaks?  Alabama.  Merle.  They're waiting until they rot.  Yeah, they're getting cold on the street.  And then we'll get out.  Because Kenny demanded that the guy who brought free food for everybody wait until 7 o'clock  like everyone else to come on up here.  And he's got to take a bite out of each one to make sure it's not poisoned.  I actually had to pull Kenny aside.  I'm like, Kenny, it's okay if the guy comes up early.  He's got food for everybody.  He's standing outside with a really heavy box of Philly food.  Yeah.  I see some of those fine Philly pretzels. 
[00:28:30]  There's cheesesteaks.  I'm like, Kenny, you can let them up a little early.  Let the guy up.  What the fuck is he standing outside with food for?  People starving.  7 o'clock.  Fuck that.  Let the guy up.  That's the time.  That's the rules that I set.  I can't break these rules.  Because something bad will happen to me.  Can someone get that guy up?  Even if you don't want to eat the food.  I feel bad for the guy.  He comes from Philly with food and he's outside.  Yeah.  I've done the Philly trip.  He had to have left around 3.30. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Had to.  And now he's just standing out there with a real heavy box of Philly food.  These things are ice cold.  I know.  Out in the frigging cold outside.  Kenny has no concept of like being a human.  He doesn't.  It just.  We're working on it, man.  One day he's got to show some kind of sense that he's a human being.  He'll never be human.  Right.  Let's go to Bill.  Brontosaurus.  Alabama.  He looks like Brontosaurus. 
[00:29:30]  Alabama more.  I'm going to fucking text Tron and tell him to let this guy up.  Yeah.  Text Tron.  I was wondering if they're going to get your own little elevator so they can drive your  cars up to the floor like Howie does.  I don't know if that's true.  Ah.  Ah.  I hear.  I hear that Howie and his car gets moved right up to the whatever floor we're on.  What?  There's like a car elevator.  That's what I heard. 
[00:30:00]  And that brings them up.  No.  Last time I tried to go to Sirius, it was a whole huge hassle at security.  Really?  That's why I don't go over there anymore.  Dude.  I would never.  I'm like, I work here.  Can you figure it out?  They're like, I don't see.  Then they're calling up for people.  We can't let you go up.  Can you wait?  And then I'm waiting in the lobby for 15 minutes.  Finally, someone comes down.  And then we have to go through the whole security thing again after that with the license and  the picture.  I'm like, I work here.  So I'm like, you know what?  I won't be around until you guys figure this out. 
[00:30:30]  So I haven't been over there in a couple weeks.  And that's the reason, by the way, if you're wondering, if you're listening over there.  Enough with making a problem.  If you don't get the, I don't want to go into it, but stupid Will from California.  If you don't get the beef between the two camps that we've been talking about, then you  just do a lot of Googling.  Yeah.  And shut up.  Let's go to Ray in Vermont.  Oh, you could call him Ray. 
[00:31:00]  What's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  Hey, I want to tell you, your new studio is like Archie Bunker's worst nightmare next  to a queer and a black guy.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, Archie Bunker would have said a queer.  A queer day.  What did he say back then?  Did he use the, he used to say colored?  No, he would say spade.  He would say, yeah.  He would say spade?  Yeah, yeah.  I heard him use spook once.  Yeah.  He was talking about one of the guys on a loading dock.  Queers and the spooks.  Yeah.  He wouldn't have said. 
[00:31:30]  And a whole audience would laugh.  A whole live audience would laugh.  Now, we're going to make friends with the blacks across the street.  That's for sure.  The blacks.  We're going to need their firepower.  Their firepower.  They're gats.  They're going to need Anthony.  What are you talking about?  Well, yeah, they're going to be going, damn, yo.  No, see, here's the problem.  Anthony is a responsible gun owner.  Those guys, you know, they don't need laws.  Legal gun owner.  An anomaly.  Right.  That's the problem.  You're a responsible gun owner. 
[00:32:00]  And we need, you know, we need firepower.  So we've got to make friends with them right away.  I'm going to the Friends of the NRA banquet dinner.  Are you really?  Yes.  Friends of the NRA banquet dinner.  I sent for my tickets.  Cool.  And got them.  Yes.  I'm going to sit and be able to have a band.  Well, I'd listen to some speakers about the Second Amendment.  What is that, Hillbilly Fest?  Hey, it's on Long Island.  It's, I believe, April 16th. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And they got door prizes.  And you know what they are?  Guns.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, nice rifles for raffles and stuff like that.  And then they got some unique things you'd be able to purchase, silent auctions.  It's fantastic.  But for the raffle, knowing there's a lot of gun freaks there, they got to come up with...  Gun owners, Opie.  They're not freaks.  They are gun owners.  Anyway, with all you gun freaks attending this thing, they got to have...  I'm going to red flag you.  Red flag.  They're gun owners.  Oh, man. 
[00:33:00]  They have to come up with some good door prizes, meaning really good guns that you gun owners don't have yet.  Dude, you're talking like matching pistols.  Yeah.  That are engraved and a commem...  I think there's a commemorative Charles Bronson.  Oh, Charles Bronson.  Charlton Heston.  Gun.  Just, you know, things that us in the know in the NRA.  Hey, I'm also part of the Second Amendment Task Force, by the way. 
[00:33:30]  I'm part of the Second Amendment Task Force in conjunction with the NRA.  What is that?  Well, that is somebody who is keeping tabs on what politicians want to do to take away our Second Amendment,  and writes to congressmen, gets people motivated, talks with like-minded people,  and tries to come up with solutions to counter these attacks on our constitutional right to bear arms, Opie. 
[00:34:00]  That's what I do.  That's why I'm attending the banquet, and that's why I am part of the Second Amendment Task Force.  I got a cool little pewter medallion for it, and a certificate that I can hang on my wall.  I'm amazed you have time to do the radio show at the point.  It's amazing.  Jesus.  Are you going to buy tickets for the raffle rifle?  The rifle raffle.  Oh, is it a rifle raffle?  I thought it was a raffle rifle.  No.  Well, if you win it, it's a raffle rifle.  If you win it, it's the raffle rifle.  Oh, rifle raffle coming up.  Rifle raffle tickets.  Buy your rifle raffle tickets.  Say that five times. 
[00:34:30]  I actually can.  It's easy.  It's a nice Weatherby rifle out there.  What is that, David, that you just barged in in the middle of my fucking conversation?  Yeah, that really was shitty timing, David.  Who sent you in?  You have the worst timing.  I didn't send you in.  David.  What happened?  We're flowing, man.  Now he doesn't want to talk.  We're flowing, man.  Now he's distracted because he's not talking.  What are you doing?  You guys were inquiring where the guy with the food was.  It didn't necessarily mean bring it into the fucking studio.  I thought I'd bring it in and show you.  You were wondering where it is. 
[00:35:00]  It meant let the guy up into the place and put the food out there until we could get...  You brought a whole fucking box of pretzels and up for the whole fucking city into the...  Were you just thumbs-upping me?  Why are you thumbs-upping me?  I was showing you the food.  You fucking retard.  I was showing you the food that you were asking.  Where is the food?  I didn't ask!  And it was the fact that the guy was on the street, not that the food wasn't sitting on  the console, brought in in the middle of an important conversation.  Yeah, it was...  Mustard?  Yeah, it was mustard. 
[00:35:30]  I don't know.  Have you ever had a Philly pretzel?  Well, that's a different story.  Got off on the wrong foot, I think.  For real, have you ever had a Philly pretzel?  I haven't.  Have it with a little mustard.  I'm gonna.  I want to heat it between two plates, though.  I don't want my pretzel touching that fucking filthy microwave.  Yeah.  What's wrong with the filthy...  It's got rats in it.  I'd rather heat my food inside the Octomama's vagina than that fucking horrible microwave.  David, is anyone signaling you to stay in the studio?  No, no one is.  Is Sam, like, out there going, no, they want you to stay in? 
[00:36:00]  No, not right now.  It's not, no.  Get the...  Get out!  David, the pretzels, buddy.  They're gonna heat them up.  You're...  All right.  Tell Steve to heat their...  And, I'm whispering this.  Yeah.  You do know that David isn't the problem here.  Oh, I know somebody sent him in.  I think it's Sam.  There's a few guys in cahoots.  Yes, yes.  And their whole bit with us is to send David in at the worst time ever. 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  And insist that we need him.  That we need...  Yeah, they need you in there.  Yeah.  Bring the food in.  That's what Sam does.  He goes, they were asking for the food.  Here, take it.  Take it in.  And then David would say something probably like, but they're talking...  No, no.  They want you to just go in there.  Yeah, they've been working that bit for a long time.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's fantastic.  They think it's hilarious.  It is.  It's hilarious.  It's gonna be real hilarious when they see the cut list that's gonna be on the wall.  Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.  For all the people that try it out for a high school sport, and you go in the locker room 
[00:37:00]  hoping your name's up there.  Hey, am I up there?  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Oh, maybe the mathletes will take me.  And you find out your name's not on the list as everyone else is jumping up and down.  Oh.  Oh.  That just proves the coach was a twisted motherfucker.  Dude, looking at the happiness on the people's faces.  We made it.  We made it.  We made it.  And you look and go, ah, I ran down the list.  Maybe I missed it.  Yeah.  Let me check the C's again.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm saying, no, I'm not up there.  I'm not there.  Yeah.  And look at the joy and happiness.  They have a whole school year of camaraderie and happiness. 
[00:37:30]  The coaches were lazy.  They didn't want to spend all day lining up the potential athletes and talking to them  one by one.  They didn't want to do that.  And secondly, they didn't want to go through that uncomfortable moment when they have to  tell the kid you're not on the team.  So what did they do?  A list of the people that made it.  Right.  And the people that are going to be really sad because they didn't make the team.  Tough shit.  Tough.  Tough shit for you.  That's right.  That is right.  Those pretzels did look pretty good, huh? 
[00:38:00]  They certainly, and I normally don't eat pretzels.  No?  Why?  I'm just dieting.  Oh, carbs?  I'm not 100% dieting.  Now, I know the picture of me.  Can I clear something up?  Because there's a picture of me that was floating around with Chris Jericho and where I happened  to be wearing a very sexy outfit.  Yeah.  But I look a little mushy in it.  But I was wearing tight Speedos that pushed everything up.  They weren't just regular shorts.  Where is that floating?  I tweeted it.  Oh, you did?  Look at the pictures to your right. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, my God.  But I don't have to look very manly.  Okay.  But that's around the gutters a little bit.  But those were very fucking tight shorts and Speedos.  Let me tell anybody who would criticize that beautiful picture of James Norton.  Why can't you just...  Pick up a picture of Jimmy from a few years back and put it next to that one.  And then criticize that man.  I defy you to...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's not as bad as it looks so. 
[00:39:00]  Look at you with the net.  No, you got like pecs and fucking shoulders.  Look at you.  You know who whipped me into shape?  Sexy.  The same girl who has to tolerate Steve naked.  Whipped me into shape.  Jesus Christ.  She finally gets to work with a heterosexual.  Sort of.  It's so weird having my ass looked at while I work out.  You know what I mean?  When her breasts came into frame, I'm so sorry.  Somebody usually yells yuck when these are shown.  But MJ, and she has a site. 
[00:39:30]  It's MuscleSorority.com.  She's not asking me to plug it, but I'm plugging it for her.  MuscleSorority.com.  She's fucking great, man.  I'd love to see some comments on that picture.  They're not good.  No.  What are the tags?  About homosexual.  I bet the tags are real good.  Jericho fisted him.  Gay twinks.  So gay.  Very gay.  Liberace gay.  Life partners.  Punchable Marys.  Jericho gave fluff.  Oh, no.  Full release.  Broke his arm after. 
[00:40:00]  Triangulation of Crossfire.  That's the key.  Muffin top.  Oh, stop it.  I do have a little muffin top.  B-cups.  But, dude, that's because of fucking things.  It's a very tight.  It's a pair of shorts.  Yeah.  Grandma Norton.  Tussleable haired boy in background, I guess.  Oh, I did a fucking...  Wait.  Tussleable is great.  I did a scene.  There was a kid in the show.  I'm not going to say exactly what was happening, but I had to do a scene where I was trying to...  It was a kid's party.  I was talking to him.  He had the most tussleable hair. 
[00:40:30]  Really?  The most tussleable hair.  Did you tussle it?  I did during one of the scenes.  I gave it a little tussle.  Tussle.  Yeah.  Let's see.  99 Luftballoons.  Sniper in Window.  Stuffed Pants with Gourd.  Meaty Tits and Masturbation Injury.  I guess because Chris Jericho's arm is in a cast.  He's a fucking good improver, man.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's a very good actor.  He apparently was a...  He told me he was like a groundling for a year. 
[00:41:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, he's definitely got really...  I was a foundling.  I didn't know, Patty.  Shut up.  I had a lot of fun on that set.  I'm going back today.  Oh, you are.  That was a fun fucking show to do, man.  Oh!  All right.  You want to take our first break?  I certainly do, Ope.  Let us.  I want to thank Ron Fez for sticking up for me a little bit.  What happened?  A little bit, a little bit.  Who badmouthed you?  You sure that was Ron Fez?  I know.  That's weird.  I noticed they like to take their shots at me. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, it's all in good fun with those guys.  But then we have the nice talks on the street with Ronnie.  Yeah.  We say we're like two ships passing in the night.  Here's Ronnie with his cigar and his posse and me and you stop.  We have this really nice chat.  It's all a work.  The whole show's a work.  Ron is never like me.  What?  Never.  Ron loves James Norton.  He's never like me.  Comedy genius.  I've heard that word.  He doesn't mean it.  Well, he doesn't like people that don't know his show. 
[00:42:00]  That's a cold word for faggot.  He doesn't like me.  He doesn't like you because you don't know his show.  But I go home.  I love him.  That's probably true.  You know.  Me and Anne, everyone's wild.  We'll throw a little Ron and Fez reference in there to tell the boys, look, we're there  for you.  We're listening.  Constantly listening.  That's right.  To the Ron and Fez show.  Right now in my headphones, we'll replay the Ron and Fez show.  I don't even have to listen to our own show during the show.  Watch what I do to prove that I would listen to Ron and Fez.  What are you doing?  Eastside Dave, for some reason I don't have your phone number.  I thought I did.  So let me just send the text verbally. 
[00:42:30]  One, one, one, my friend.  Oh.  One, one, one.  Oh, no, you didn't.  One, one, one, my friend.  You put the word out.  That's right, I did.  Wow.  Jimmy doesn't even know what that means because he doesn't listen to the Ron and Fez show,  but I, Opie from the Opie and Anthony show, indeed listen to the Ron and Fez show.  I know.  I fucking listen to the show all the time.  All right.  What's one, one, one, then?  One, one, one is like, you know, if you're not too sure about the score of a game.  Right.  How did the team do?  One, one, one is an exciting way to say they did very well.  One, one, one. 
[00:43:00]  Fez is against me, too.  What?  Fucking Fez.  Fez adores you.  No, he doesn't.  Bad mouth to me for fucking eight years.  Let me really go deep.  Yeah.  Fan of the Ron and Fez show?  Fan of the Sam and Dave show?  Proving that right now?  Dave, I hope you do kick Dr. Steve's kid.  And I think it's a bare knuckle fight that he's challenging the five-year-old, too.  That's how much I know. 
[00:43:30]  I know the Ron and Fez show, and I know the little side project called the Sam and Dave show.  There you go.  Special delivery.  Well, special delivery.  Special delivery.  If you want to be really technical.  You're right.  You're right.  But one, one, one.  To Eastside Dave.  That's what I say.  Do you think that Lush is awake?  No.  Listening and hearing that?  Well, someone better wake his ass up.  Hung over, probably has a baby crying in his ear, and still isn't awake.  You know what was funny?  They're advertising his, what, his baby shower this weekend? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And how they're promoting it?  The second annual.  Yeah, the second annual.  That made me laugh.  So, just that phrase, the second, just, just think about that for a second.  The second annual.  Yeah.  Eastside Dave baby shower.  Eastside Dave could not be more stereotypically Irish.  He is just complete Irish.  Look, I'm a fan of the Irish twins.  Me and my brother are barely a year apart.  Yeah.  I get it. 
[00:44:30]  It's, uh, it's, it's very Irish.  It's a very Irish thing to do.  The second annual.  They just love blowing loads into their chicks when they're fucking percolating.  After the break, I am going to explain to Jimmy what 1-1-1 means.  I already know.  All right.  What is it again?  Texas and Eastside Dave.  Wow.  Fucking signal.  It's a signal.  Holy shit.  For what, though?  For what?  For what?  For what? 
[00:45:00]  A boom.  For what?  For what?  For what?  That pretzel looks delicious.  I'm not going to eat the whole thing.  It's good, isn't it?  I'm going to put a little clear stuff on it and hand it out.  You warmed that shit up?  I certainly did.  You warm it up a little bit and then you throw a little of that mustard on?  It's heaven, man.  Dude, there's nothing better than a pretzel with mustard.  I mean, that includes a blowjob with three fingers knuckle deep.  Four fingers?  All right.  Well, we can debate that.  I know I'm a bit prejudiced to this, but Philly has probably the best local food in the country. 
[00:45:30]  Do you like Philly's food?  I mean, their cheesesteaks are ridiculous.  Where's that motherfucker with the cheesesteaks?  Best local food.  Wow.  New York has their thin pizza.  Yeah.  Right?  Boston has...  What's the Boston thing?  Racism.  Racism.  Very good.  Although...  Boston's North End Italian food?  Yeah, but I...  Is that like...  That's not really...  Yeah.  It's hack.  Yeah.  It's got...  What is Boston's food?  I don't know.  What are they known for?  The clam shatter, I guess?  Ugh.  Manhattan clam shatter?  And their lobster.  And their lobster?  Their motherfucking lobster. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  Buffalo almost there with their chicken wings are just...  The wings are what they're known for.  But then they blow it with their stupid bake...  Their...  What do they call it?  Fish fry Friday.  What the hell was it called?  I think it was just called fish fry.  I think you've got to be up there to know that.  Buffalo wings, you know, like, all around the country.  So you need the food that everyone knows?  Yeah.  So like Philly cheesesteaks, New York chicken wings, New York pizza.  New York comes in a distant third in that race, I'm telling you. 
[00:46:30]  In what race?  In the local food thing.  Oh, oh.  I don't know.  New York pizza fucking...  When you're stuck in some place that's not New York...  Right.  ...and you want pizza...  Especially...  I've lived in fucking Southern California.  It's shit.  Yeah.  The pizza was such shit.  And people are like, no, it's great pizza.  Oh, if you like pizza, you're going to love this pizza.  Shut up.  And then you take a bite of it and the dough is like...  Disgusting and dry and... 
[00:47:00]  They're using like the wrong cheese and it's too much cheese, not enough sauce.  It's got to be a perfect balance.  They say the water is wrong for the dough.  Really?  Like New York water is unique.  Well, that you need it for...  Meaning very polluted.  It's polluted.  You need that fucking...  You need that pollution to get a nice dough.  Who knows what they're dragging up in these rivers.  Yeah.  You know what?  I heard New York tap water is actually very good.  Yeah, it is.  But the problem is that some of the pipes are old.  Yeah.  But the water itself is actually some of the best drinking water from Boston down to Jersey. 
[00:47:30]  If you run it through one of those filters...  That's chill.  Leave her alone.  You run it through a filter.  Ketchup.  Give me some fucking ketchup.  Holy Jesus.  Wow.  What is that?  Where are the cheesesteaks from?  Geno's.  Geno's.  All right.  All right.  Now you're talking.  I want a Diet Coke.  I don't know why.  Show for electronics?  What is this?  You know what's funny?  The guy's got to work because Howard's off on Friday. 
[00:48:00]  Oh.  So now the rest of the guys go out there and do all this stuff.  You're going to get another gig?  Yeah, I guess.  Being an electronics expert?  Yeah.  Is that a radar detector?  Baba Boo is now an electronics expert.  Expert on WB or PIX11?  He actually is an expert because we've known for a long time that he's a secret agent.  Boo.  He's a double agent.  Not much of a double agent.  He makes believe he likes both sides.  We're on to you, Gary.  You really got to stop.  You bastard. 
[00:48:30]  Stop saying hi to us and saying it's great that we're all in the same building.  You old bastard.  How was that, Coke?  All right.  Can we take a break and then we're going to explain one, one, one after the break.  Yeah.  I already know what it means.  This cheesesteak is greasy.  Because it was sitting out there.  I specifically told Kenny to degrease my cheesesteak.  It's going to be greasy because it took a long trip.  Degrease it.  The way to do that is to take the cheesesteak and hold it against yourself and hug the oil  into your shirt and put it back in the package. 
[00:49:00]  I don't think that would be very tasty.  You have to degrease the cheesesteak.  Hi, Bobo.  Yeah.  I was just about to acknowledge that Bobo's there and we've got a big one.  I think we're going to have a huge audience today.  I'm going to be scared.  Yeah.  Bobo.  Philly cheesesteak.  Yeah.  Y'all have one.  No.  We're not offering.  No, we'll give Bobo doesn't make a lot of money.  Give him a fucking cheesesteak.  Bobo.  Fuck that shit steak.  Philly cheesesteak.  Philly. 
[00:49:30]  Very close to Jersey.  What do you got on that?  It borders Jersey.  I just need to go across the bridge.  You didn't work the cheesesteak thing in.  Wait, I'm giving you the thought starters.  You got Philly.  Toasted Jersey.  You got a Philly cheesesteak.  And you got some fine Philly pretzels today.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Just like Bruce.  Philadelphia.  I go there to get a cheesesteak and a pretzel. 
[00:50:00]  Because it borders Jersey.  And there's a lot of hard-working men out there.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hard-working men.  He went with the blue collar.  I like that.  I like it too.  They're all staring at us.  So I guess we got to do something. 
[00:50:30]  Hi.  A lot of chicks out there today.  That's a big crowd already, man.  A lot of chicks out there today.  Do we at least have one chick out there to look at?  Where?  Oh, yeah.  Look at her.  Hey.  What's up?  Opie and Anthony on your radio doll.  On your radio doll.  Good news.  Who wants to call Sam's phone?  Who wants to call Sam's phone?  Bid is on.  Turn down the bed.  I'll call.  I don't think I have Sam's number.  It's the twink hotline.  I have your number. 
[00:51:00]  Do you have?  Oh, is this?  Wait a minute.  I don't know if I have Sam's number.  You should have Sam's number.  Let me see.  Do we text?  We've texted once or twice in the last two years, I think.  And perhaps we do have exchange numbers.  Where would it be?  Under Sam or?  What do you have me under on your phone, Sam?  Jim Norton.  There's Sam.  I got Sam.  Yes.  Do you dial his phone or I dial it?  What do you want to do?  I can hit it right now.  Can you?  What do you guys want to do?  I don't know.  Who's hitting it?  Oh, well, you just hit it.  Oh, Jimmy hit it.  Well, I'm going to call, too. 
[00:51:30]  To mess you up.  You'll just get a busy signal.  I can hit every morning on the Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history  of satellite radio.  Pretty amazing.  I got a phone call, guys.  That's my ringtone.  That's your ringtone.  Bit on.  Yeah.  We demand the entire staff get that as their ringtone as we move over to the big Sirius  XM building.  That's right.  Because you guys will be spread out throughout the facility, and that will be heard all over  the place every time you guys have to take a business phone call.  That is great. 
[00:52:00]  Or a personal phone call.  Nice.  No more vibrate.  No more vibrate for Sam Roberts.  Nope.  Let me see.  Okay.  I don't.  Well, Derek, I don't have Derek's number.  I've never had Derek's number in all these years.  I have made it fine and dandy.  Without having him.  Without needing Derek's phone number.  It's useless.  It's useless.  What do you get when you call him?  Because I've never called him either.  A drunk on the other end.  Yeah, he's a drunk.  Why would you call him?  He's a drunk.  Yeah, you get just all drunk on the other end. 
[00:52:30]  Fucking melancholy douche.  Yeah, I was trying to think, because I knew there was somebody.  I think I was trying to get in touch with once.  Yeah.  And E-Rocs.  I got E-Rocs, right?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Yes, I do.  Eric.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Uh-oh.  I don't think I have E-Rocs.  I think that's Logan.  No, Logan's under Logan.  Right?  I'll give you E-Rocs right now.  No, I got E-Rocs.  917-3.  Boo.  Oh, no. 
[00:53:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa, no, no.  Whoa.  Whoa.  The microphones are on.  Oh, man.  Oh, hey.  Danny just plopped something down here that looks like it could be hilarious.  A woman faints on news.  Anchors handle it calmly.  What is this about?  Well, I guess there's a big volleyball tournament going on somewhere,  like in Florida or something like that.  So they decide they're going to interview, I guess, one of these volleyballer persons.  I don't know exactly who she is, but they're talking to her about this volleyball thing, 
[00:53:30]  and I guess she didn't eat in the morning, and she just takes a header.  And it's not so much her fainting.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, we don't get a...  No, it's nothing that great.  But the way the anchors handle it, it's just a calm, and, yeah, it's just great.  They handle it just so professionally.  Oh, boy, all right.  I see where you're going with this.  He's at Sharky's Beach Club out there for some beach volleyball. 
[00:54:00]  Hey, Wayne.  Hey, good morning to you, Grego.  Per your directions, I didn't wear any shoes this morning.  How could you on a beautiful day like this?  A little bit chilly right now, but it's warming up,  and there's lots of stuff going on out here at Sharky's,  associated with the big volleyball session coming up.  Now, joining us is Nikki Allen,  who's going to talk a little bit about what's starting today.  Nikki?  Yep.  Well, starting today, we have a Collision Challenge.  It's open to any college.  Any college.  Oh. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, I'm afraid Nikki has fainted, I'm afraid.  Let's go back to the studio for just a couple moments.  Okay.  Well, thank you very much, Wayne.  We hope that Nikki is doing all right.  We'll check back in with you in just a few minutes.  Let's head over to Justin.  Justin, if you could help us with a school day forecast.  We'll be right back.  Yeah, he's right here.  He's moving in.  There he is.  Gosh, we're going to say a prayer there.  Wayne's right out there.  I think they'll be able to.  I think they'll be able to.  I think they'll be able to.  We can see off camera sitting up now, so apparently we're doing all right.  A little too early. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  A little too early.  Wayne's good, but some more guests, not so much.  All right, and we'll let you know what's happening there as well.  Wow, if it's not written down for these dummies, they don't know what to do.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, golly.  Well, that's wow.  Yes.  I know this part's a little visual, but you just got to see her as she faints because the  camera actually pulls out after she faints, and it just looks like a dead pocket.  Can I correct Danny?  Because he said this part's a little visual.  You have to see her.  Yeah, a little visual. 
[00:55:30]  That'd be 100% visual.  That's her right there.  Yeah.  She's looking.  She sounds like she's ready to go right when she gets on mic, and she's teetering.  Look at her.  Any comments?  Look at her.  Oh.  Look at the look on Jadilara Ketchis.  Look at her back to the studio for just a couple moments.  Watch out the pads out.  Please watch that again.  She is down for the count.  That made my dick jump.  Wow.  Why don't you have to set a prayer out to her? 
[00:56:00]  I know.  Why don't you just keep the camera on that fucking...  We all know someone that has fainted in front of us.  She was rocking back and forth, and just like...  Oh.  The systems were just shutting down in her head.  All right.  That's overloading.  Shut her down.  Shut down the equilibrium.  Think she was nervous?  Too much power.  Think she was nervous on the news?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Maybe.  You could audibly hear the moment her brain loses consciousness.  Yeah.  She starts out with this whole slurring thing.  The last thing to come down her fucking brain stem was... 
[00:56:30]  We got some nice parting gifts for you.  Thanks so much for playing our game today.  Now, joining us is Nikki Allen, who's going to talk a little bit about what's starting today.  Nikki?  Nikki?  Yep.  Well, starting today, we have a Collegiate Challenge.  It's open to any college.  Uh-oh.  She's wobbling.  Any college.  Oh.  Do you think her friends are going to laugh at her? 
[00:57:00]  I'll leave her ever.  Wait until it's turned into a music video and people just start going, huh, huh, huh, huh.  Death metal remixes.  Yeah.  Just watching it fall over like 20 times in a row real quick.  Do you fucking know how...  Her friends are never going to not tease her.  Of course.  That's going to be a YouTube sensation.  Send me that link so I can tweet that shit.  That's perfect for tweeting.  Brilliant.  I lied.  I know you did.  Your pants are on fire.  I saw it.  Squeezing in on my gig.  I tweet that shit. 
[00:57:30]  I tweet that shit.  Tweet.  Hey, you want to know what 1-1-1 is all about?  1-1-1.  1-1-1.  Right.  That's, uh...  I'm so fucking glad I didn't say that.  Wow.  What were we going to say?  Just a bomb.  It was a complete and utter bomb.  All right.  Now that you're...  You're not getting it out of me.  No.  Now that you're acknowledging it's a bomb.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Here's the rule of bomb.  It's always the rule.  You don't drop the...  It's the rule.  You can...  It's not... 
[00:58:00]  If you say, look, that would have bombed, and the joke is done.  And you say, this is what I was going to say, but you're not saying it in joke, but  it's actually not bad.  That's right.  You're acknowledging it's bomb.  It can't...  It can't...  Worse than bomb.  Yes, it can.  Like, uh...  I've done that, though.  This is not funny at all.  For 1-1-1?  Yeah.  Come on.  Now we have to know.  Just trying to put something together where it's like 9-1-1 in an emergency, only it's  not all that important.  I'm not saying it would have been a fucking...  A humdinger? 
[00:58:30]  It would have been an award winner, but I mean, it wasn't awful.  I didn't even have it worked out in my head, but I was ready to jump on it anyway.  Just go with it.  Like, hope I could work it out as it was coming out of my mouth.  Ugh.  Oh, boo.  Oh, boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  I'm going to miss this place.  I know.  Ah, you hear the energy.  New challenges.  Yeah.  New fun.  Yeah.  New friends.  A week straight of this.  Does my mic sound okay? 
[00:59:00]  How does this sound?  Open the headphones.  Does it sound okay?  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Yeah, you're like, I can barely hear it.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Jimmy's too loud.  I can't hear Anthony's mic.  By the way, we're going to get the NYPD to sweep our new facility.  Bugs?  For bugs.  I don't trust nobody out there.  We need like one of those spy store guys.  I'm not even joking.  I'm not either.  That's our first show.  Yeah.  Let's check everything. 
[00:59:30]  We're checking everything for fucking bugs.  Get someone to sweep.  We need a sweeper in there.  We've been around this game long enough.  Long enough.  Spies.  And if you want to cause paranoia, that's fine.  But, Ant and I were part of a multi-million dollar lawsuit that we still sort of can't talk  about, but we can tell you this much.  They were secretly taping us.  Yes.  When we were working at N.E.W.  From the production room.  From the production room.  Could you imagine somebody in the production room turning on, just hitting a switch, and 
[01:00:00]  listening in on your private conversations, whether it be a meeting or something, and just  sitting there collecting valuable information without our knowledge?  My God!  Who the fuck would do that?  I know who did it.  Yep.  And he needs to know that we know he did it.  Exactly.  And I do believe the guy works over at that big building.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  I saw him.  I saw him.  Unless he got cut when they did the staff cuts. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  I just picture some...  I'm picturing like old school.  Someone is in a van down below listening to our conversation.  Real old school.  Because what this...  Pizza delivery truck.  Look, what this guy did for real was he was trying to see if we were going to like bad  mouth this individual while the music was playing and while we weren't on the air.  Because these mics, even though you turn them off, you could actually still listen to what  we're doing.  Yeah.  This was something that stupid Bruce Mittman used to do up at AF, by the way.  And me and Ant would be negotiating like, all right, this is how we're going to handle 
[01:01:00]  Bruce and get our money.  And then we're like, how the fuck did he know we were going with this angle?  He could listen.  And we learned years later that you could dial a phone number.  That's what he did.  He dialed a number at his house and just would hold up the phone through his ear and just  listen to our private conversations.  Right.  Is that legal?  No.  No.  Of course not.  So we found the closet that the actual phone line was in and unplugged the phone before  every show.  We would just unplug the phone line. 
[01:01:30]  And then he came in one day and gave us the look like...  All right.  I know you're on to me.  Yeah.  Asshole.  Now give us our $2,000 raise as we're setting the world on fire.  We should have figured out a way to plug in a 900 sex line from the day.  Right.  So when he calls it up, it would bill him like...  No.  That would roll.  Like in hundreds.  That would get him right where it counts because he was a cheap fuck.  Was he a real tightwad?  Oh.  Oh my God, Jimmy.  Bruce Mittman?  Oy vey.  Was he a tightwad?  A chiseler, huh?  Total.  Real pinch penny.  And then NAW, we would be just talking about bullshit. 
[01:02:00]  It was the show.  While the mics were off.  And this guy is in the production room listening in.  But I picture old school, someone in a van, two guys with the headphones listening to our  conversations.  And they had to sit through like hours and hours of like poopy talk.  And then they're real quiet and one guy all of a sudden hears something, touches his earphone  and then points to the other guy and the other guy hits the button on this giant reel-to-reel  tape recorder that's been outdated for years. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you got?  There's a moron asking if anyone wants breakfast.  But we are sweeping that joint for bugs.  Bugs!  And that is no joke.  We ain't playing anyone's game over there.  Yeah.  We've seen it happen twice.  Twice!  Not once.  AF and NAW.  We know.  It happened a third time.  There's sneaks.  Sneaks in this business.  Sneaky Pete's. 
[01:03:00]  Yes.  All right.  So the 1-1-1.  Derek put 1-1-1-1 on the pad data.  Thank you, Derek.  1-1-1-1.  Right.  Oh, he's as dumb as they come.  Well, you know.  1-1-1-1.  He just laughs.  There's one better.  He just looks at him and laughs at his face.  Yeah.  Oh, look at Pat from Minaki out there just holding him.  Hi, Pat.  Hi.  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  You got to look, Pat.  Wow, we might have to make sure we get him involved with the David and Bobo show today. 
[01:03:30]  Perhaps.  I think we're doing a little David and Bobo today.  We should all jerk off on Pat and call him Pat from Bukkake.  Oh.  Well, all right.  If you need me, all right.  Why?  His naked picture was a big hit online.  Was there a naked picture, Pat?  Well, it was close.  On the broadcast there.  It might as well have been.  St. Paddy's Day.  He's wearing that little thong.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Pat.  I need Sam in here because this happened on the Ron and Fez show yesterday.  They brought up the fact that Ray Liotta looked at me during the Ray Liotta interview 
[01:04:00]  and said, what's wrong with that guy?  Is he sick?  Yeah.  He was like, what are you, sick?  Because I wasn't talking.  And I was like, what is that?  I thought at first that he was a germaphobe or something.  Not a germaphobe.  But you didn't want to get sick during this promotional tour that he's doing and thought  maybe you were sick.  Right.  So he was concerned.  Right.  And you know what?  I was sort of sick.  And I have to admit it now.  Now that it's getting better.  I've been dealing with a twisted testicle.  Really? 
[01:04:30]  Holy shit.  You had a twisted yo-yo, they call it?  Is it a yo-yo?  They call it twisted yo-yo.  What is a twisted yo-yo?  Well, your scrote.  Right.  And your testicles.  Right.  See the tube that comes out of your testicles that all the little spermies swim out of?  Sure, yeah, yeah.  It kind of wraps around like a yo-yo kind of so that when your sack hangs down, it's got  some slack.  Sure.  If that twists, you ever see a bent slinky?  Yeah.  A kinked slinky? 
[01:05:00]  If it does that, you'll get like massive fucking pain.  A friend of mine had that and I couldn't put his balls in my mouth for weeks.  You've got to do a headstand.  That's how you undo it.  So I was dealing with a twisted testicle.  I knew I was going to bring it to the show eventually.  How did that happen?  Well, because I'm boxing again and I'm hitting the heavy bag.  You're not supposed to hit your own bag.  Right.  Do you braid your balls like pigtails? 
[01:05:30]  And I'm not a big fan of the jockstrap.  I've been an athlete my whole life, but I hate the jockstrap.  And I got kind of the boxer briefs so everything just kind of hangs.  I'll say you need support.  The gym is warm.  I'm getting warm.  And what happens to the testes?  The testicles, they hang.  And as you're doing right hooks, everything else is doing a right hook.  And those things are flopping.  Your testes are supposed to keep a temperature of 96 degrees.  That's right.  A little cooler than 98.6. 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  That's why they hang.  Do your balls hang low?  Do they wobble to and fro?  Can you tie them in a knot?  Can you tie them in a bow?  Keep going.  I like this one.  It's supposed to be for tits.  I just made it for balls.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I like how you twisted that.  I like how you twisted yours.  Yeah.  So, a bit of an ache.  Oh, shit.  And I...  Did you immediately think, oh, my God. 
[01:06:30]  What?  You're going to have to take one.  Oh, yeah.  You do wonder when you get an ache down.  Oh, boy.  You're like, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But I went to the doctor and all.  And basically, I go, don't tell me I got old man balls already.  Did you put his finger in your ass?  I'm not old enough for you, doctor.  Hey, well, welcome, Opie.  I told you.  I moved on to the Russian broad with the nice cleavage.  Oh, okay.  I like showing it off.  Jimmy knows.  I go with her, too.  Yeah.  She wears a blouse, and she refuses to button it up.  So, she's leaning over charts.  It's like what you see at the start of pornos. 
[01:07:00]  Really?  She wears these sexy outfits, like a short skirt, a blouse.  You need a van, the ma.  And then she bends over, and you see nothing but a really sexy bra and a lot of cleavage.  Right?  Yeah.  See, Jimmy knows.  Did she cut me your balls?  She got down there.  Did the test?  She got down there.  Yeah.  Made sure I didn't have a hernia.  And then it's like, don't tell me I got old man balls.  She goes, no.  And I have to, like, I got to.  Oh, no.  She wrote out a prescription that basically said, hoist your balls. 
[01:07:30]  Hoist?  Keep them hoisted.  How?  How do you hoist balls?  Yeah.  What is it?  Basically, a jockstrap to make sure they're in place nice and warm baths to let them float.  You don't need balls that float?  Your balls are floating.  I have to float my balls for a week or two.  Dude, your balls are floating.  To take the weight of gravity off them. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or go to the moon.  Or go to the moon would be nice.  With your balls.  But she literally wrote that out.  Hoist your balls and warm baths so they kind of float.  Did she cup them gently and go, hoist, hoist, hoist, hoist, hoist, hoist, and then kind of just take the weight off of them a little bit as they hung down?  Yeah, I was like, what do you mean?  Well, like this.  Oh, okay.  Oh, well, I got you.  You'll hoist them.  Yeah, she's a...  Wow.  Feels better now?  All fixed?  Yeah, it's getting there. 
[01:08:30]  It's much better.  What happens when you pull them up?  When you're like...  Oh, when they're hoisting them?  No, no, I don't mean hoisting them.  I mean manually.  I mean like using the muscles.  Can't you pull your nuts up?  You go, whoop, whoop.  Yeah, right now I'm doing it.  It's like a lower abdominal exercise.  Oh, that feels kind of good.  Does it hurt?  No.  It feels kind of good.  No, you're easily pleased, aren't you?  It feels kind of good.  I'm going to tell you something.  Here's how you hoist your balls, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  You have to put a fish hook on your scrotum, and then you take the other end and you wrap  it around your shoulder, and you just pull real hard. 
[01:09:00]  And hoist them up.  So I got to hoist, and I got to have them float.  Someone's suggesting that you get two little tiny life preservers in the bathtub and put  them under your nuts.  So just little swimmies or floaties for your balls.  Honestly, and I swear to you, if Twitter were to allow that, I would show a picture of  my floating balls.  My balls floating.  Because that's all.  They would look like alligator eyes popping out of the water. 
[01:09:30]  That's what I would make them look like.  I would do that in a second.  Alligator eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, nice loose scrotum, like a bat wing.  Man, a couple more hoists, though, and there was going to be a problem.  Yeah.  In his office.  Look, you can handle a couple hoists, but you know, you get to three.  Now, Doc, we're going to have a problem.  Yeah, yeah.  Hoist and jiggle are very closely associated.  Holy shit.  I'm like, you know.  Hoist.  It's just one movement of her hand, one cup movement of her hand, and a hoist becomes  a nice jiggle.  I was one cup away from possibly an embarrassment. 
[01:10:00]  What, a rod?  Oh, yeah.  I'd love to get a rod in front of a female doctor.  Really?  Love to.  Love to.  Yeah, actually.  What do you say, Doc?  Instead of a male doctor?  Oh, that happens once in a while.  You know, a Greek surgeon comes in with his manicured hand and his fancy accent.  Good city attitude.  So a little back story to the Ray Liotta is he's sick, because I sort of was dealing  with a bit of an ache, but also, because I'm not going to underplay this, for the first 
[01:10:30]  time in a long time, I was intimidated by one of our celebrity guests.  It happens very rarely, but I was intimidated by Ray Liotta being in the studio.  He's a big celebrity.  And then I went to Anthony, I go, and you were too a little bit.  But you handled it much better.  I was.  I turn into a yapping Nelly when I get like that in front of a celebrity or something  like that.  I'll just start yapping.  It doesn't happen often, but Ray Liotta did it.  I'm trying to even remember the last time a celebrity made me go, oh, well, holy shit, 
[01:11:00]  it's that guy.  Bob Kelly?  Anthony Comea?  Anthony Comea, sure.  He's right up there.  John Cena?  Bob Kelly?  You mean the fucking Twitter whore of the century?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck, Bob?  Bob, do we need eight pictures of you at the airport?  What is wrong with that motherfucking attention whore?  Dude, dude, I'm here.  And then he'll just Twitter huge celebrities with personal stuff to make people think he 
[01:11:30]  knows them.  Hey, Favreau, why don't you send me those pictures of fucking...  You don't know John Favreau.  Dude, he wants to be loved so bad.  What was the one he'd sent to Jimmy Fallon early on?  Yeah.  Didn't he say, like, good show, Jimmy?  Yeah.  No, he's even worse than that.  Hey, Fallon, good show, dude.  And I'm looking at this and going, he doesn't know him.  He doesn't know any of these guys.  Can you get a few of those tweets for us?  And then I go to Jimmy Fallon's, because I don't follow Jimmy Fallon because it's just  too many fucking, like, posts and shit, and I follow a very limited amount of people. 
[01:12:00]  And I go to Fallon's to see if maybe there's an answer on there to Bob Kelly's.  I can't even find, like, a Jimmy Fallon response in all the friggin' Twitters he gets.  Do you think that Jimmy follows Bob?  No!  Holy shit, no.  No.  Holy shit on a stick.  Hell no.  But he is just a twittering whore.  Let's see how many, now, I'm going to go to Tweety, because that's the one I use. 
[01:12:30]  Ha, you sweetie.  You got the Bob Kelly one?  Yeah, there's Bob.  What do you write?  I can't see this from there.  Do you, thank you.  Oh, to Jon Favreau?  Yeah.  He writes, do you read these?  Because he's bummed out that Jon hasn't written them back yet.  Okay, do you read these?  Like, he's not going to answer Bob Kelly.  Bob.  How many, uh, look at him responding to Opie like he knows Opie.  Oh! 
[01:13:00]  Thanks, God.  I, I, I don't even, I never read that.  I, I swear to God.  He's responding to my, some of my shit.  I never read that.  I do read all the replies.  But, I don't remember reading that one.  Thanks, God.  What is thanks?  Thanks, God.  Thanks, God.  A couple, that was like 20 hours ago.  20, ah, whatever.  How can I tell how many times I've tweeted?  Here I am at the airport, dude.  Dude.  His, his first, the first time I noticed that, that he tweeted to Jon Favreau.  Yeah.  It was so pathetic because it just said, come on, Charles, hit him. 
[01:13:30]  What's up, Jon?  How's things going, bro?  You did not write.  I swear to God.  I'm so disgusted with Bob, I'm going to stop following him.  Just stop.  You know what?  Boink.  Done.  I have stopped following Bob Kelly.  You're on to something?  Block old Bobby Kelly.  All right, I'm in, too.  I am in.  Actually, I'm going to write, go F yourself and then block him.  Let's all just block Bob Kelly. 
[01:14:00]  You're out.  Fucking Bob Kelly.  You're out.  Has to stop.  You're out.  You're out.  Dude, I was at the airport.  I was John Favreau.  John Favreau.  And here it is.  Block.  Goodbye.  There it is.  Bye.  I just stopped following him.  That's what a bitch.  Bye.  Goodbye.  They call that, what, a Twitter-holic?  I've been accused of that.  Him and his goddamn...  Really?  I've been accused of being a Twitter-holic, so I'm trying to back up a little bit.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  But when you do the radio show...  Look on my feet.  Acclamation point.  Oh, my God. 
[01:14:30]  It's all the speakers.  But I do a lot of the show stuff, too, so that makes my...  Makes up for the shoes.  Yeah.  Do you know I was...  No, people are happy that I showed the shoes again.  They're like, oh, my God.  Those are the famous shoes that you introduced about a month ago.  Nice.  Famous.  Good to see that you're actually wearing them.  Yeah.  That was in the shot where I was, you know, at the big office...  Conference table.  Of course.  Hey, let's get to the Ron and Fez thing.  So the...  Fez.  Huge setup here.  The Ray Liotta.  Right.  But let's start with the original clip. 
[01:15:00]  This is what Ray asked me that day.  And now keep in mind that I was dealing with a twisted testy.  Testicle or testy?  Testicle.  Testicle.  Is he sick?  No.  Why?  What have you heard?  He hasn't said anything.  I'm just enjoying today.  He's Fezzing.  Hey.  Yeah, I don't like that, Jay.  I'm Fezzing.  Are you insulted that he called you Fez or that he's making fun of Fez?  I think me and Jay worked out whatever weird problem we were having that I have no idea 
[01:15:30]  about.  So let's keep it at that.  It was something in Jay's head.  I guess.  Something that popped up.  But we're good now.  We're good now.  Everyone's good with Jay now, right?  Jay rules.  Yeah.  He gave us some amazing radio the two times he came in in the last week or two.  All right.  So Ronnie got on board, right?  Sam?  Yeah, because they played this clip because of Jay making fun of Fez.  But Ron didn't even realize that Ray had asked if you were sick.  So as soon as he found out that that was Ray Liotta asking you if you were sick, Ron 
[01:16:00]  took your side.  All right.  Did Liotta ask him if he was sick?  Yes.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was it.  Fuck you, Ray Liotta.  How's that fucking sound?  Goodfellas and out?  That's it?  Don't fucking come in here acting like that.  And oddly enough, he just reenacted the scene in Goodfellas that he, when they're like,  how come he doesn't talk anymore?  He's like, I'm just listening.  Oh, that's funny.  Why don't you talk more?  Say something.  What the fuck kind of weird shit would he just tell? 
[01:16:30]  How did I just say we just murdered someone?  And I'm sick.  The guy's still alive in my fucking trunk kicking.  That's why I'm not talking.  Why everybody else is eating pasta.  Wow.  And then it continues with Dave starting to threaten Ray Liotta.  Well, Dave was also, he drank a lot on yesterday's show.  That figures.  It was one of those shows.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck this shit.  I don't know.  I'm going to take a drink.  Fuck Ray Liotta.  All right, we got a problem with Mr. Ray Liotta. 
[01:17:00]  We're fucking calling out our buddy.  Yeah, fuck you, Ray.  You're going down, bitch.  I'll fucking slap you around like you slapped Jason Patrick and NARC.  Well, you know what, Jason Patrick fucking deserved that, though.  You know, I don't normally stick out for Ray Liotta.  But fuck Jason Patrick, too.  I don't have any fucking time for him.  And maybe he wasn't fezzing.  Maybe he just didn't want to step on anyone.  That was it with that one?  Yeah.  Okay.  Fezzing.  Even he said fezzing. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  It's become a word.  Yes.  It's like a verb.  And finally, Dave puts down the gauntlet to Mr. Liotta.  I wish Opie would have fucking came up off the goddamn chair and smacked him in the fucking  head with the heel of his boot.  Opie's got to fucking take your shoe off and beat him like he's President Bush.  He doesn't have to be Ray Liotta's dancing monkey.  I'll say this right now.  If Opie or Mr. B ever want me to hit Ray Liotta, you just text me 111. 
[01:18:00]  It's going to have to be one-handed because you're old Jameson.  Text me 111.  Hold on.  I've got to find Dave's number.  I have it listed under Never Call.  And there you go.  That brings it all together there, Jimmy.  111.  Did you text?  I did a verbal text.  I told you that because I don't have his number.  I got his number.  I will by the end of the day.  I got Dave's number.  I thought I did too, but I don't.  111.  And he's got mine, much to my chagrin.  No kidding.  Holy shit. 
[01:18:30]  Does that guy love late-night texting?  The drunken text I get.  Mr. Anthony.  Yeah.  I love you.  I love you so much.  You are the greatest.  You and Mr. B and Opie and Jimmy and the greatest.  Yeah.  You are right.  Did you get a St. Patrick's Day voicemail?  Oh, I certainly did.  So did I.  They are the best.  Do you have it still?  No.  What are you kidding?  Sam played his on the Sam and Dave show.  Could you play real fast for us?  Yeah.  And then he accused, what, Casey of being on your payroll or something? 
[01:19:00]  What?  What's wrong with him?  I was listening to the Sam and Dave show.  And something about, I don't know, Eastside Dave is now accusing Sam of having his wife on  his payroll.  What does that mean?  Guy's nuts.  Did he mean it like figuratively like a gangsta would say?  Yeah, I don't know.  What, are you on a payroll?  Look at Sam.  Conveniently he has it and it's on CD.  Of course.  Look at this kid.  All the best.  Right.  What was the thing about Casey being on your payroll? 
[01:19:30]  Well, I think he asked if I was on his wife's payroll, which he had no explanation for after  sobering up.  He had no idea why he said that.  Here's the voicemail from St. Paddy's Day to Sam.  First saved message.  Did my wife have you on the payroll, you son of a bitch?  Me best.  Call me back.  Oh, shit.  That little fucking Jew David has asthma attacks and I'll fuck him in the ass. 
[01:20:00]  End of message.  End of message.  That is so drunk that you can't even put together one coherent thought.  And he doesn't even remember doing these.  No.  For the most part.  There was supposed to be a new special delivery show this weekend, but we tried to record yesterday  after the drunken show and then this week there will be a rerun of special delivery.  Oh, look at that.  Yes.  They're on to something, man.  Sam and Dave, the show's really good. 
[01:20:30]  It really is all right.  We've got a little chemistry going.  New young up-and-comers.  Ronnie's phone call to the Sam and Dave show is really funny.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to.  I'm going to have to.  Where can I hear this?  Can I download it?  Do you have the Ronnie phone call?  I can get it in like 10 minutes.  You should.  Okay.  Because it'll be a nice.  Cross promotion.  Cross promotion helps the Sam and Dave show, too.  Ronnie called in while he has kids running around, and one of the kids is dressed like  a dinosaur.  You've got to hear the call. 
[01:21:00]  Classic.  He was just calling in to give the boys a little support, I think, because you can't  tell when.  You don't know.  With Ronnie, you know.  It looked like he was calling to support, but what he was saying was the complete opposite,  so you figure it out.  Like you said earlier, the whole show's at work.  The whole show's at work, man.  You don't know what's real or what's not.  What's up, E-Rod?  Well, Sam's getting the other stuff.  I get voicemails from Dave, too, but they're usually asking for where food is in the garbage  cans.  What?  Because if I'm here late and after their show's done, he'll root through every garbage 
[01:21:30]  can in the office and just start eating whoever's food is left over.  Holy shit.  And he does it in front of me all the time because it makes me sick.  But he said, hey, did you have a salad today?  I was like, yeah.  He's like, oh, there's not much left in here.  I said, no, I ate the whole thing.  So he'll start licking the inside of the salad bowl.  Why aren't we videotaping this?  We got a homeless guy working among us.  Yeah.  Why don't you tape that?  I don't have that camera, but I will.  It's broken.  Yes. 
[01:22:00]  Tape it.  Take pictures.  Whatever, man.  That's stuff that people want to see out there.  Derek has the voicemail if you want to hear it.  And this is like 6 o'clock at night.  He's not doing it for anybody's radio show. 
[01:22:30]  I mean, we're not bringing it to the radio, but.  No, if he knew anybody on this show had food.  Yeah.  He'll find the garbage can and eat like the grapefruit rinds or anything that's in the garbage can.  What's fucking wrong with him?  He's poor.  Why would he do that?  He's poor.  He does a really good job.  I mean, the company should give him a few more bucks, I'm telling you.  Yeah, good luck.  Just find some money, will you?  Good luck with that one.  Just find a few bucks over there, will you?  A few shekels.  Jesus. 
[01:23:00]  After you get a bailout, guess what?  That means you can start doing some business again.  I don't know about that.  Good luck.  Red paddle?  Red paddle.  Red paddle.  And it just threw me a red paddle.  You got to get the red paddle on that one.  All right, I got to stop.  Touchy.  Touchy stuff.  All right.  Touchy situation.  Well, we got the hot teen busted for nude pics story.  Dude, I don't care who you are as a guy.  I don't care how fucking religious you are, how high and mighty, what politician you are. 
[01:23:30]  This shit is hot.  How old is she?  Fourteen.  Shut it.  They're texting each other.  I'm not talking about like fucking anything.  They're texting.  She's texting and posting fucking nude pictures of our, to show her little boyfriend.  That's kind of cool.  Get out of here.  That is the hottest fucking thing.  Give me a break.  Well, why don't we do a little survey?  Hands up if you agree with Anthony.  Hot or not. 
[01:24:00]  Hands.  Well, which, hands for hot or not.  Which one?  It's, it's all, Pat held up both hands.  That's hot.  You guys are all saying that's hot.  You agree with that?  Yeah.  And it all depends.  Is she a little emaciated 14 year old?  Or is she like, you know, one of those put together 14 year olds?  I heard they were extremely graphic nude pics.  Yeah, but what she's being charged with is, it's just, oh, it's ridiculous.  But, but, uh, uh, they, they're going to charge her with, like, child pornography. 
[01:24:30]  It's her.  It's her.  She took her picture, but she posted it, and that seems to be the problem.  But, um, where is this invisible internet that doesn't exist?  Like, it's this internet that you hear about where people are posting shit like this, and  it gets back to the school, and all the students see it, and it's on this, and then, yeah, you  know people are right clicking and saving these pictures and then posting them elsewhere. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  I'm not privy to this invisible internet.  Oh, I look.  God, why don't we go into business?  The invisible internet.  Let's start a company called the invisible.  Because it's illegal.  Not if it's invisible.  That's the beauty of our company.  Unfortunately, it's not invisible to the feds.  They have complete visibility.  No, we've got to get them in on it.  But I never accidentally go like, holy shit, that's the fucking naked Twitter pics of the  fucking 14-year-old. 
[01:25:30]  What's the URL for the invisible internet?  I don't know.  I-N-V.  It's instead of dot com.  It's dot I-N-V.  Imagine there's something like that out there.  It's a whole other world.  And only the feds know.  Secrets, there's UFOs on there, and the Loch Ness Monster, and naked 14-year-olds.  And they're laughing at us.  And they're laughing at us because they're like, these dummies, they just...  They keep pushing dot com and dot net.  All they had to do was dot whatever, and it's a whole fucking...  And who would ever put in dot I-N-V?  Right. 
[01:26:00]  Hmm.  Maybe we tried dot FBI.  Maybe that's all it is.  Or dot CIA.  Oh.  Can you imagine, though?  I bet you that's out there.  Pshoo!  Uh-oh.  Cyper just got picked off.  Yes!  Yeah.  All right, uh...  The truth is out there.  Is it?  Yeah.  Was that movie good?  Uh...  Nah.  I guess we were supposed to see it because we were supporting him back then.  It was...  I watched it, uh...  You know, not bad, but... 
[01:26:30]  A little too late?  A little too late.  Yeah.  That happened weird things.  It's like apparently they had a kid together and something happened to it, but they didn't...  Mulder and Scully.  Oh, the movie?  Yeah.  Who the fuck wants to see that?  I saw it!  Hey, we had him in the studio.  I like David, but I want to see the movie.  I can't wait for Californication to come back.  All right, here we go.  14-year-old girl facing kiddie porn charges for posting new pics on MySpace.  Texting is, I guess, texting, like sexual things or pictures or whatever. 
[01:27:00]  I don't really think it's that common.  High school seniors Josh Arkin, Corey Niddle, and their friend have heard about sex things.  It's where teens send naked pictures of themselves by cell phone.  But they're surprised to hear that a 14-year-old girl from Clifton was actually arrested on Tuesday  for uploading nearly 30 nude pictures of herself onto her MySpace page, according to the Passaic County Sheriff's Department.  It's a little strange because it's her page and I wouldn't want to do that.  Why does she get the kiddie porn charges?  She posted it. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  I thought because she was sending it to infants.  Yeah, regardless, if they're of you, once you post them, yeah, then it's, you know, you're posting it.  Unconstitutional.  Sam, don't post any naked pictures of yourself.  Why?  Oh, you're a little twink.  You'll get kiddie porn charges.  All right.  You little twinkie.  Oh, look how fast he fucking came in with that.  I thought it was a nine minute.  No, it's for, it's for, it's for, this is perfect then. 
[01:28:00]  Okay.  And then, uh, second half of the story.  Passaic County Sheriff Jerry Speziale says the middle school student says she posted the pictures onto her MySpace page so her boyfriend could see them.  What happens is once she opens it to the boyfriend, it exponentially starts spreading.  Her pussy?  Like wildfire.  Because of New Jersey's loss, the teen is now charged with one count of child pornography possession and one count of child pornography distribution.  This mother of two thinks that was a good call.  I think that it's right that the girl is charged. 
[01:28:30]  I think that maybe it will send a message to her friends.  The girl has now been released to her mother's custody.  By the way, authorities say more arrests are likely.  I hope she's not a fatty.  The bottom, at the bottom line is just Megan Cancish, mother.  I just, I don't even care about the legal ramifications of this story.  I just cannot get my mind off of the fact that she's fucking putting up naked pictures of herself.  Because you got that picture in your head.  Yeah.  Yeah, I actually have the picture in my head.  You don't want it to be tainted. 
[01:29:00]  And if it's some fat little fucking three foot tall Mexican chick, I don't want to see it.  The pictures are on mysnatch.com.  So it looks like it.  Thank you, Kevin from Connecticut, for letting us know about that.  I doubt it.  Megan's law is named as Megan Cancish, and her mother thinks it's ridiculous.  Thinks it's crazy.  It is crazy.  It's not what the law was meant to fucking do.  It's for predators who are fucking filming kids naked, you assholes.  Do you think this girl would be a threat to a neighbor as she's older, moves into her own place? 
[01:29:30]  Is she going to be a threat to the neighborhood children because she took fucking nude pictures of herself?  Stop it.  It's for creeps like me.  By the way.  Get a little chuckle from the audience.  Yeah.  They love reality.  They're nervously laughing.  Nervous titters.  I got to challenge that as not the best teenage news story of the day.  Are you insane?  We're in the middle of teen news, by the way.  Teen news.  We just set this up with our fine teen news bet. 
[01:30:00]  Hot teen news, wasn't it?  Hot teen news.  Hot teen news.  That is a good teen news story, right?  But I say the best teen news story goes to this guy.  All right.  Listen to the laughter that ensues.  Teen paints giant...  They say dirty picture.  Yeah.  But it's a giant penis.  So it should read, teen paints giant penis on parents' roof.  Yep.  Whose penis would he be painting?  Huh?  Oh, you mean it was him and another guy?  See, he would be painting the penis itself. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Bravo.  A British teenager has some scrubbing to do.  Uh-huh.  After his parents discovered he painted a 60-foot-long penis on their roof.  Anyone want to know why he did this?  I know.  You do already?  Yeah.  Jimmy, you know?  I'm out.  Um, because his good friend Stephen bought a hand glider. 
[01:31:00]  I love a smile on my face as I'm gliding.  Yes, I'll be by in a minute.  I know which one is yours.  Foki and Anthony's Hot Teenious.  That's right.  A British teenager has some scrubbing to do after his parents discovered he'd painted a 60-foot-long penis on their roof to get his home noticed on Google Earth.  This isn't really that hot.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Could we have used that for the other story?  The last story was hot, but a boy painting a cock on a roof doesn't quite strike me. 
[01:31:30]  Let's do another poll.  Am I the only one on that one?  Yeah.  Call me silly, but, uh...  Foki and Anthony's Hot Teenious.  Rory, 18, decided to make his family home stand out after watching a documentary about Google Earth.  Armed with a bucket of white paint.  Uh-oh.  Did he have his own white paint?  Warp, warp, warp.  He climbed on top of the $1.5 million home.  His artwork remained unnoticed for 12 months. 
[01:32:00]  Wow.  Until a helicopter pilot spotted it.  Wow.  Look at this.  Paradise.  And swooped down low so his passengers could take photos.  Dad, Andy, thought it was a prank call when a British newspaper contacted him about the painting this week.  So, basically, the parents have no clue, and the newspaper finally called the guy.  There's a tallywhack on the roof here.  Right.  Yes.  Right.  Yes.  It's an April Fool's joke, right? 
[01:32:30]  There's no way there's a 60-foot dick on top of my house, Mr. McInnis told the sun.  No, there it is.  You can Google search this.  Wow, yeah.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Is that a good fake penis drawing, Jimmy?  It gets the point across.  I cannot see it.  I'm trying to get it up on the screen for you if the Internet feels like doing anything working.  Feels like working?  Working.  It's not like a super bad penis.  No.  That's for sure.  And it's got two little balls at the end.  Tiny, tiny little balls.  Little tiny, teeny English balls. 
[01:33:00]  Well, he just ran out of room for the balls.  Yeah, he really did.  He started big.  He started big with his cock.  And realized, to his horror, much to his horror, he ran out of room for the balls.  Well, he could have used this part of the roof where it slips down.  Yeah, that would have been more authentic, like a side view of the cock.  Sure, you know?  He's going for, like, the bottom view or something.  I don't know.  The bob shots?  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break?  Going to break with the Ron Bennington call into the Sam and Dave show. 
[01:33:30]  Try to promote those guys.  Their show's pretty good, for real.  Great.  Our replacements.  Yeah, who knows?  That's probably what's going to end up having.  We're lifting up all these shows, and they go, whoa, hey, we got a cheaper version of Hoping Anthony.  We can get that for $20, $30.  You already got the cheaper version of Hoping Anthony.  It's called Hoping Anthony.  Too much?  Nah, nah.  I'm still green.  Green paddle.  I'm still green.  You're green.  Ron calls Sam and Dave while they play the breakfast song.  The key to this is, Sam tried to push this dumb breakfast song onto our show, and we rejected it. 
[01:34:00]  We said no.  It doesn't, what?  We have quality standards on the show.  There's no standards here on the show.  It didn't bypass muster.  Not at all.  So he decided, well, those guys don't know what the fuck they're doing.  We'll play it on the Sam and Dave show.  Teach his own.  And Ronnie kind of picked up on the fact that it was a rejected Hoping Anthony bit.  And this is what ensued.  We have a phone call, Dave.  Ron Bennington.  Hello, boys. 
[01:34:30]  Hey.  You're on special delivery with Sam and Dave.  Oh, fantastic.  Oh, this is what this is?  Special delivery with Sam and Dave?  Yeah.  What?  Not the rejected ONA bits and Ron and Fez bits.  Dave, have you been using rejected Ron and Fez bits?  I don't think so.  I think...  Well, yeah, he tried to get his stupid, uh, is it okay to tell a buddy you're masturbating  on our show and we rejected it earlier this week.  Oh, Dave, you didn't tell me that. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  That was rejected.  Yeah.  Mr. B's right about that.  You guys went back to back of stuff that isn't good enough for the virus.  Here's what I think.  I think Opie heard the breakfast song and said, this is very strong.  Why don't you use it on the weekend?  And yet, you know, he didn't.  He probably didn't, Sam.  What do you mean?  Do you guys realize now why you're trailing the watch show?  What is the watch show?  I don't know exactly, Dave.  I keep hearing the name, but I've never heard the show. 
[01:35:30]  I really think of something just to taunt you guys with.  Yeah, we were, the watch show, I heard a little bit of them last night, but I don't remember  what it was because I was pretty drunk.  By the way, who's answering your phone, Dave?  That is Brockovich.  All right, Brockovich is on my shit list.  Oh, no.  Because he goes, who's this?  And I say, you know, Ron Bennington.  And he goes, okay, what do you got?  Oh, Brock.  You're off the phone.  Get him off.  You're off the phone. 
[01:36:00]  Get him off.  Get him off right now.  I fucking got myself.  That's what I got right here.  Yeah.  That's what I'm bringing to the show.  Brock, in my defense, I've had more than one Ron Bennington call.  No.  Where is it?  Get him off.  Hip-hop Ron.  Hip-hop Ron, you're replacing him.  Mr. B, Sam brings in.  I tell him, here's how Ron Fez does it.  Dave shows up and Pepper shows up.  Sam brought, I don't know, about 14 or 15 ONA interns.  Yeah, you know who he sounds like now?  ONA.  They're just standing around.  They want to learn the craft. 
[01:36:30]  But at least we do, at least now we can take Brock off the phones and get someone else  for giving Mr. Bankton that treatment, because that fucking shit don't fly.  What's that headset doing on your head, Brock?  You're out.  You're out.  Mr. B, did you watch Twin Peaks yet?  It was Friday last night.  I was going to text you, but then I just passed out.  No, I don't do anything you ask of me, Dave.  Oh.  What about King of Comedy?  Well, here's the deal, boys.  Yeah.  Didn't we all go to bat and say, hey, you're going to love these kids. 
[01:37:00]  Give them a try?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And now you're running the breakfast song.  That's a good song.  I know, you know.  Because I was thinking it would lead into a conversation about which foods wouldn't be  in heaven.  Oh, my.  Dave, you got one kid and another one coming?  Yes.  And this is what you pushed all your chips on, the breakfast song.  Well, listen, not everything works out.  It's possible.  I mean, the breakfast song might have went on a little too long, Sam.  It's only halfway through.  You'd be better off with a noose. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Did you hear Dave's pedophile song?  Yeah.  Start doing real stuff, stuff that hasn't, you know, been already rejected from the other  shows.  Dave, keep your fucking pants on.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because that's my chair, too, and Anthony's.  Oh, you know, my pants are on.  My pants have been on.  He pulled them up before he sat down.  Why not?  Because I'm hearing things.  No, no, no.  People talk.  People talk.  My pants have been on. 
[01:38:00]  My pants are on.  Oh, I see.  So it was just radio magic.  Theater of the mind.  All right.  Thank you, Mr. B.  Thank you for.  Hold on.  That's one of Dave's dates.  Yeah, you look like a real dinosaur.  I got to go.  My date is on.  Bye, Mr. B.  Bye, Mr. B.  We play a game called Dinosaur.  You know, I put a leash on and I chase around.  We play Dinosaur.  Okay, honey.  I'm back in a second. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  See ya.  Yeah, I'm going to try to catch you.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Yeah.  I just play with me.  I'll go.  I'll go.  Yeah, you know what?  Yeah, that's it.  That's the game we play.  You know what?  Give me some more wine.  Would you, honey?  No, no.  Oh, no.  Don't get him any more wine.  Hey, you get me some more wine.  I'm going to chop the rails.  All right?  Oh, no.  Not in front of a child.  What?  Not in front of a child.  No.  No.  It makes me feel like I wish I was there to stop it. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  I got to go, boy.  Leash.  Okay.  All right.  Weekend time.  Happy birthday.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye, Mr. B.  Weekend time.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jeffrey Ross. 
[01:39:30]  Hi.  Nothing for Jeffrey?  Why do you think you guys are here?  They're shocked.  Can you give us a little energy?  Yes.  I thought you were going to say something else before they were supposed to clap.  They're all shoving food in their mouths.  I think I did fuck it up.  They just heard my name and they perked up.  They were waiting for a big, boisterous intro.  They're stuffing their mouths in.  That's what you're saying?  Yeah.  I saw Patty eating like a fucking chipmunk.  She had her cheeks bulging out with food.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, look at me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:40:00]  Jeffrey, are you from Jersey?  Yes.  Hey, Bobo, Jeffrey Ross, watch what we do for you.  He does a Springsteen impression that will knock your socks off.  I didn't even want to.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Jeffrey Ross, appearing at the Stress Factory, star of Dancing with the Stars, and the roast  master himself.  He roasted Larry the Cable Guy recently.  Are you ready?  Jeffrey Ross, he's a hard-working man.  He roasted another hard-working man. 
[01:40:30]  He's from Jersey, and he screws up Dancing with the Stars.  He's performing at the Stress Factory tomorrow.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Man, that was the F Street Band.  Yeah.  That was inspiring.  See, you haven't listened to the show in a while.  That's a big hit on the show lately.  I don't hear the same pizzazz in his whoa, whoa, whoa as I heard.  Yeah, what's wrong with your whoa, whoa, whoa today, Bobo?  Let a scream out.  Yeah, give us the laugh. 
[01:41:00]  Nothing.  Something I ate gave me the hiccups.  How about a big jungle land scream?  Don't you eat a bowl of dumbbell?  Well, it goes away in a few minutes.  Yeah.  It's Bobo Springsteen, Jeffrey.  You know, we're doing nothing but the best radio bits lately.  Let me see how this sounds.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's the energy, Bobo.  We need the energy.  Yeah.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, how about you stand up? 
[01:41:30]  Stand up.  I mean, it's Jeffrey Ross.  Come on.  Do it.  You're lackluster.  Jeffrey Ross, he roasted another blue-collar guy.  He's performing at the Stress Factory tomorrow, and he's from Jersey.  Something happened to the mic.  Are you constipated?  Get that guy some prunes.  He's one half of the David and Bobo radio show, Jeffrey.  Oh, I see.  And, you know, you're a Jew, right? 
[01:42:00]  Sure.  Oh, you're going to have to meet David a little later.  This is exciting.  What does he do, Neil Diamond?  The things you find at O&A.  You never know.  Fresh-squeezed orange juice and Bruce Springsteen impersonation.  You don't like Kristen?  When she came in, I didn't like her.  I don't like the way she looks.  I don't like that whole fucking I'm a madam or I'm a sex surrogate or I'm a sex therapist 
[01:42:30]  or one of the...  Well, they're all out of the same fucking mold.  They look like realtors.  They look like those realtor women that drive you around in their fucking caddies much too fast.  With their big fake boobs.  Yeah, and they have tons of fucking paperwork in their front seat.  That's what she looks like.  That's the same mindset.  She thinks she's hot.  That is a fucking man with a blonde wig on.  She has great big fucking Botox lips.  I love those to suck my dick. 
[01:43:00]  Botox lips are horrid.  They're fucking big and smooth and soft.  They're not.  They're awful.  They're fake-looking duck-billed platypus cunt.  They feel good on your dick, though.  Big soft lips like that on your dick?  What?  They feel good.  Then fucking get Edward G. Robinson to blow you.  Fat lips, they look fake.  But you didn't explain.  Kristen was the Elliot Spitzer madam.  Yeah.  She was on our show, and we had a pretty good interview with her. 
[01:43:30]  And then the next day, she decides to tell the world that she had sex with A-Rod, I guess.  Yeah, apparently.  Thanks.  Thanks for throwing us a ball.  And then he gave her a fat lip.  Yeah, and then he punched her in the mouth.  You're good.  I hate when these people are holding back stuff that they're going to give somebody else the next day.  We were even saying, you know, hey, what do you got?  Come on, give us a name.  Let's make some news.  Give us this.  Let's make some news.  And, of course, next day, she decides to say something.  Yeah, great.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Fuck her.  Thanks for nothing.  Fuck her in her cock.  You think she was a hooker back in the day?  That's why she looked so messed up. 
[01:44:00]  She said she wasn't what she was.  She had to be.  Come on.  She ran a hedge fund, right?  On Wall Street.  Yeah.  That's what I mean.  A hedge fund.  Hedge.  Who wants to buy a bunch of shrubs?  It's so stupid.  No, Jimmy.  Oh.  A hedge fund has nothing to do with shrubbery.  That's my new character on this show.  I don't get it.  Oh, what would your name be?  Let's see.  I don't get it.  Stupid Jimmy.  No.  No.  Not get it guy?  Yeah.  Oh, don't get it guy. 
[01:44:30]  Patty's really having fun out there.  Patty, why are you smiling a lot and almost laughing?  I've got another minute of vacation time this month.  That's right.  I'm taking it as best as I can.  I'm taking it?  That improvisational skills on Patty.  Vacation from where, doll?  Vacation from where?  Amazing.  We just get like about 15 minutes every few hours, you know, so it's like a personal day  or something.  Jeffrey, let me jump in. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, please.  The hardcore listener is sick of hearing it, but she works at Starbucks.  Yeah.  Don't Patty.  She's collecting vacation time.  And after how many years you've been there?  Three years.  After three years, tell Mr. Ross how much vacation time you got.  Well, hold on.  Before you answer, how many weeks of vacation would you assume, Jeffrey, someone has collected  after being on the job for three years?  Three years.  She's got to have three weeks a year of vacation time?  Yeah.  So anywhere from six to nine weeks, right?  Nine weeks probably, yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't you tell Jeffrey how much vacation time you got after working at Starbucks for  three years?  Well, let me remember.  I took some of those hours, so now I've got like four and a half hours left that I can use.  You took some hours, and she's got four and a half hours to use.  It's sad what's going on with Starbucks.  They're laying off a lot of people.  The Starbucks near my house closed down.  Yeah.  I had to walk across the street to the other Starbucks.  That's a shame.  That's funny.  God bless you, doll.  Thank you for doing the good work that you do.  Four and a half hours of vacation. 
[01:46:00]  Six dollars for a cup of shitty coffee.  It used to be good coffee.  It used to be.  I was a fan of the early days of Starbucks.  What are they, getting cheap beans?  They overextended themselves, and they couldn't keep up with the expensive beans, so they started  to get the cheaper beans, but didn't tell anybody.  Now their coffee's just as good as anybody else out there.  They'll sell you a three-liter cup of coffee, but you can't take a piss.  I hate it.  Yeah.  They'll tell you to go down and sneak into a restaurant.  You just spend four dollars on a drink. 
[01:46:30]  You're right.  It's sad.  Yeah.  Their coffee is causing you to have to pee, but they hold that fucking restroom key like  it's gold.  Like there's gold in there or something.  Coffee's a diuretic, and they send you off into the street to shit between cars.  Like a homeless guy.  It's like, Jesus.  I live a block from Starbucks, and I charge girls two dollars to come pee.  It's not a bad business in these hard times.  That's what you've got to do.  Sometimes I sell DVDs.  I sell a place to urinate. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, it's the piss.  Jeffrey, you also might notice, I'm just trying to get you involved here, all that stuff over  there on the couch.  You going to auction it off or what?  We're just giving it away to the listeners because a week from today, the live audience  goes away.  And we officially move after Friday's show, by the way, so you can show up next Friday  as well.  After next Friday's show, no more live audience for a while, so we're clearing out our office  and we're just giving our stuff to the audience.  We're giving it all away.  That's right.  I know it's always a little strange you're moving, guys, and the truth is change is always 
[01:47:30]  good for this show.  As a fan, I've always noticed when things get shaken up for good or bad, it does something  to your personalities, to your comedy that's always fun as a fan to watch.  Well, that is true.  We will have things to talk about.  So this whole excitement thing, I'm not feeling it, but I am feeling...  Oh, good.  I'm still green.  Green paddle.  I'm feeling a little apprehension.  I'm feeling...  Oh, whoa.  That almost...  It's kind of turning a little, but it's still full green. 
[01:48:00]  Full green.  Full green.  I got to explain this, too.  I think I'm figuring it out.  We're all about the radio bits lately.  Have you ever been to the Brazilian steakhouse?  No.  You eat until you turn over your paddle to red?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  See, we and I have finally discussed some things behind the scenes.  We're like, you know what?  Let's not blow up our spot like we do every single fucking time.  Yeah, let's try to keep our job.  So now we got the red and green...  Well, one paddle, one side is red, one side is green.  So when one of us starts going down the fuck management road, the other guy holds up the  paddle and makes sure he's not going too far. 
[01:48:30]  And then you just got to stop.  Right.  That's fair.  That makes sense.  It's a little too out of hand.  It's maturing.  You're maturing a little bit.  So go ahead, Ann.  You got green paddle right now.  I was just thinking that going over there, I think we're going to be treated like shit.  Red!  Red!  I don't have a paddle, so I have to yell.  You know, just based on a few things...  You're still green, my friend.  A few people...  Maybe I shouldn't be holding this paddle.  That's right. 
[01:49:00]  Maybe Jimmy should be the one holding the paddle.  Yeah, that's true.  You'll just hold it to green the whole time until we get the fucking phone call.  You can't go by him.  Anthony always has sort of a negative attitude.  Yeah, don't I?  You play the cynic on the show.  Do I really, Jeff?  Well, I'm not trying to break it down into a shrink session.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  Change is good, and I, you know...  I'm not a good change person.  Once everybody in town fires you, there's nowhere else to go, so you should just try to support management.  Don't you do it!  I got nowhere else to go! 
[01:49:30]  Green.  Yeah.  But you are a little bit pissed off, I can see.  Yeah, I don't...  Well, there's reasons.  I kind of like these digs, you know?  There's reasons.  It's like you're going from your own apartment to a fucking halfway house.  That's pretty much what it is.  Teal!  Teal!  Oh, shit.  I got the teal.  What does that mean?  What does teal mean?  Teal means keep going, but proceed with caution.  Right, right?  From Ted's Paddle Emporium.  That's right.  Ted the Paddle Holder.  That's right.  Yellow paddles means don't be such a scaredy cat. 
[01:50:00]  Green paddles means can I have some money?  And red paddles means we're watching this as a pruder film.  Jeffrey, we got it.  Black paddles means the value of our property just went down.  That's right.  A racist joke from Ted.  As long as it's from Ted.  It certainly is, Gregor.  Because it's from a character.  He's a cactus.  Hey, so, no, we got a guy over there who's the I got a guy.  I got it.  I got it.  You try to explain anything to him. 
[01:50:30]  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  But he doesn't do anything about it.  And then at the end of the day, everything you explained gets just swept under the carpet.  And they do whatever they want.  Anyway.  So whatever ideas you have, it's like, yeah, we want to do this for the show.  We think this would be good.  We think this would be a good atmosphere.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I think what we should do is take it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  And then when everything's done, they didn't hear a word.  And this is what you're doing.  And they do whatever they want anyway.  So he's hearing you and not doing anything. 
[01:51:00]  I don't even think he's hearing.  I think he's having another meeting going on in his head.  Red paddle.  I just got red paddled.  Red paddle.  All right.  Put the brakes on.  I don't have paddles.  You want your own paddle?  No, but until I get my own paddle, I'll send you signals.  The truth is, guys, as much as you want to be totally lounging in, like, this supersonic  studio, you guys could do this out of the back of a van and the fans would love it.  Good point.  Have you seen the new studio?  It's actually in the back of a van.  They're redoing the van.  Oh, no. 
[01:51:30]  He's smashing a newspaper on the console.  Is this your son?  No, that's green.  Oh, that's a green signal?  That's silly because that looks like red.  Oh, no, that's green.  That means go.  What's red?  Show us red.  You tear.  That takes a while.  It certainly does.  You tear little strips of newspaper off.  They don't like your signal.  So, why don't we start giving away our office officially?  How are we doing this, Ant?  Yeah.  Well, we were going to do Let's Make a Deal rules. 
[01:52:00]  Ooh.  You guys bring some cool stuff?  You remember the famous game show Let's Make a Deal, don't you?  Yeah.  Where, at the beginning, the host, what was that little bastard's name?  Monty Hall.  Monty Hall.  Very good, Jeffrey Ross.  I used to play poker with him.  Did you?  For real?  Was he good?  Sweet guy.  Was he good?  There's a lot of stuff for animal charities.  Yeah?  Great guy.  At the, uh...  The Friars Club in L.A.  Dude, I walked by the Friars Club two nights ago.  I didn't even know I walked by it.  Someone...  I was having dinner with an old friend. 
[01:52:30]  He goes, yeah, my building's right next to the Friars Club.  I'm like, I walked by it and I didn't even know.  Yeah.  I want to go in there.  Let's go.  Today?  We can go Monday if you want.  Monday.  See, this is how these guys are.  Me and Jimbo are working at this.  See how these guys are.  We got a gig.  We got to shoot.  All right, let's get back to Let's Make a Deal, Ann.  What do we got going on?  Well, Let's Make a Deal.  Monty Hall will go out in the crowd, and in order to get the people to then pick things  behind the big door, he would find out if they had little trinkets on them.  Do you have a bobby pin in your pocketbook? 
[01:53:00]  Remember when he would do shit like that?  They're looking for bobby pins.  And then they'd be like, oh, wait a minute, Monty.  Don't look for a bobby pin, you fucking mutants.  It's an example.  This crowd's going to be like, do you have a cock ring on?  Yeah.  Shit like that.  Exactly.  That's not a bad idea.  A cock ring on.  We need a red butt plug.  Oh, that's green.  Sorry.  I don't know a very funny bit about this.  You would say, no one ever had the shit that he was looking for.  All right, we got two minutes left.  Turtle shit.  Does anybody have any turtle shit? 
[01:53:30]  Fucking Otto.  That's good.  I need a bad Bruce Springsteen impression.  Yeah.  You got one right there.  No, not that bad.  Damn.  Who's the host of Let's Make a Deal?  Yeah, who's doing it?  Well, we got Pat from Winnocky.  This is our choices today.  We got Bobo, but Bobo's doing the Springsteen thing.  I say Pat, man.  We got Pat might be...  He's the best choice.  ...the fan favorite.  I was going to go with David, but he's a bit overexposed lately.  Yeah.  Pat, you want to be the host of Let's Make a Deal? 
[01:54:00]  I believe Pat probably remembers watching Let's Make a Deal, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Pat.  You remember when Monty Hall was on The Odd Couple?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, he was Oscar's friend.  And, yeah.  Well, no, it was...  Was he his special friend?  Oscar was the back end of the horse.  Yeah, yeah.  It was Oscar's friend, and Felix wanted to be on so bad.  And he was on, and then he won, but then they told him that friends of, you know, Monty 
[01:54:30]  couldn't play, and he got all upset.  All right.  Pat, you want to tell your little observation about that penis story we had a little while  ago?  The big 60-foot penis on the roof of this kid's house because he wanted their house to  be recognized on Google Earth.  We just did the story about 15 minutes ago.  Yeah.  Apparently that penis had a case of the shingles.  Wow.  The big 60-foot penis on the roof.  Boo!  When did Curly and Grossberger have a baby? 
[01:55:00]  Hey, I'm losing weight to play the Jim Carrey story.  He's gaining weight to play Curly.  Oh, boy.  You've got to Jim Carrey yourself out of here.  I'm not that strong.  Hey, did you...  Telling me.  Did the Biggest Loser call you back?  Oh, my smell is.  Biggest Loser call you back?  I was pushing for you.  No.  Oh, boy.  What assholes.  You would be perfect for that fucking show.  And then they get our audience all of a sudden watching a show they would never watch.  Yes.  A whole synergy. 
[01:55:30]  Yes.  I heard that they're extending the tryouts until April 3rd, so I'm still pushing for  you.  Okay.  I have no pull, but...  I have no pull, but...  I have no tryouts until the sores on your legs heal up.  That's because he doesn't...  Oh, he can't take care of himself.  He's got diabetes and he doesn't have money to take care of himself.  He's got the diabetes.  I'm starting to die on April 1st.  Officially starting it April 1st.  You ought to call Liberty.  You're fooling.  Liberty delivers medical supplies for your diabetes. 
[01:56:00]  How about a hazardous waste bag for my toes?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he's got nine toes.  He lost one to the old Big D.  And I lost a nail off the other one.  Oh, shit.  Did it bring it in?  Slowly coming off?  We could have done something with that.  That was going to be the first thing they were going to ask for in the game show.  It was a toenail.  Yeah, you could have been a contestant.  Who has a toenail?  Who has a skateboard?  All right, Pat.  Pat, you are the host of Let's Make a Deal.  Okay.  For some of the stuff that's coming out of our office.  By the way, we're giving away stuff from our office every day. 
[01:56:30]  Where's Carol Merrill?  Oh, remember?  Carol Merrill, yeah.  I think she's out there and she currently works at Starbucks.  I think that's who Carol is.  Bring in Stalker Patty.  Oh, Patty.  Who's going to help with Let's Make a Deal?  Where is the bitch?  Paul.  Yet again, she's in the bathroom every time you ask her.  Holy shit.  I got to diddle myself now.  She's giving birth in a toilet.  What do you think she is doing in this?  She drinks a lot of coffee.  You know how many dumps she probably takes?  When she pees, it sounds like a cappuccino machine.  All right, Pat, you're going to do Let's Make a Deal. 
[01:57:00]  You get to pick out something from the couch.  What do you want to give away right now?  And explain what you see, too.  This hard hat looks pretty cool.  It's the official WOW hard hat.  That, I am amazed, has stayed in the office for as long as it has.  Some guy brought that in once and we kind of just went, yeah, that's fucking great.  That's similar to my head.  It has a custom paint job on it, sort of a tortoise shell look. 
[01:57:30]  And, of course, the famous WOW logo on the front.  And a turtle fucking my head.  Yeah, that was good.  It might have been kind of funny if I didn't say turtle shell finish.  Oh, that's all right.  So listeners are going to bid on this?  No, Let's Make a Deal.  Also, Pat's going to come up with some item that they might have.  And the first person that shows us that item gets the prize there, Jeff.  Oh, you're giving that away? 
[01:58:00]  No, you have to wear that as the host of the Let's Make a Deal show.  That's right.  So now pick something else.  All righty.  Hmm.  Well.  Oh, boy.  How about this lovely XM bag?  That's horrible.  Wow.  Come on.  How about you put something in the bag?  Yeah.  It'll be a double prize.  They get the XM bag and something in the bag. 
[01:58:30]  Grand Theft Auto Shocker?  Foam hand.  Foam hand thing?  Oh, man.  That should be the closer.  All right.  And how about...  Oh, the bag also has a Velcro close to it.  Oh.  A little extra.  Foam.  Foam.  Fish, filth, slime, muck.  Wow.  One lucky dealmaker will get this.  I think we got to...  Better have something good.  How about we put one more thing in the bag?  Okay.  Wow.  We don't want to do this all day either, so we got to clump some questions.  What's that autograph photo over there?  That looks like it'll fit.  Oh, wow. 
[01:59:00]  Kurt Angle and Big Kev.  Kurt, thanks for keeping it real.  Big fat fucking cunt of A.  Oh, shit.  Can we see that?  Oh, my God.  So that's how Kurt Angle signed the picture, huh?  He's not reading it right.  It's a picture that Big Kev supposedly signed, but it kind of looks like a forgery.  Supposedly signed.  Exactly.  It was laying around the office.  Right.  Okay.  Put that in the bag, Pat.  We might have to, like, pump this up. 
[01:59:30]  I might take this one myself.  Okay.  Pat, one more thing from the couch.  Get Patty a microphone.  We got enough stuff in our office.  Yeah, Carol Merrill.  She's a...  I don't have a free FM sweater.  What is it, a hoodie?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Wow, that's a collector's item because that's eight formats ago.  All right, free FM.  All right, now...  Money, double the value and put today's newspaper in there.  Put me on free FM on top of it.  I don't know.  Well, yeah.  Patty, do you know who that...  Wait no longer.  Do you know who Carol Merrill was? 
[02:00:00]  No.  Not long enough.  I've never heard of him.  Never heard of him.  Him.  Great.  Not the name, Joe.  Hey, dummy.  Did you say Joe Merrill?  Did you?  Yeah, it's Carol.  It could go either way, I know, but it's usually a girl's name.  I don't know who the person is.  Now, did you ever watch Let's Make a Deal, the game show?  Yes, I have, but I don't remember the name of the host.  It's been years since then.  It wasn't the host.  It was the girl that stood next to, like, the boxes, and she goes, and he said, and you  could win this prize that the beautiful Carol Merrill is standing by. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, okay.  Donald, you have the hardest job on the show.  You have to look pretty.  Yeah.  Good luck there.  So you have to be one of the girls.  How about you watch The Prices, right?  Yes.  You know how the girls stand next to the prize?  I can't go like this.  And do that whole...  Right.  Right.  Do that.  I won't pack you.  But you've got to talk a little, Patty.  Yeah, you've got to, you know.  Come on, eye candy.  Usually they don't talk.  They just talk.  Come on, eye medicine.  Oh, I know. 
[02:01:00]  Well, that would be good for you, not talking.  Oh, God knows she's not going to give anything away from Dicker and Dicker of Beverly Hills.  All right.  Jimmy, Jimmy actually spun around in his chair with his eyes like he...  It was the eyes of a gentleman that sees a semi coming towards him.  Wow.  El Bommel. 
[02:01:30]  Morning, Mr. Beckham.  Oh, God.  Wow.  You know what it was?  What was it, Jim?  Is it possible we could get a replay of that?  I'll tell you why.  Believe me, we've all done it.  It was the way you went, Dicker and Dicker.  Instead of Dicker and Dicker.  It was like, yeah, sometimes when you fucking hit the ball hard, it's like, God damn, I can't believe I fouled that one.  I fouled it.  I swung around and spun, and the ball was in the catcher's mitt. 
[02:02:00]  Derek?  Do we have that?  Yeah, he's fine.  The only thing that could be on here is Pat's here.  Here it is.  God knows she's not going to give anything away from Dicker and Dicker of Beverly Hills.  All right?  Oh, with the pathetic little self-giggle I gave.  You can almost hear the hyphen. 
[02:02:30]  All right, Pat.  What?  Oh, God damn.  Why the fuck isn't Pat on this show more?  Pat rules.  You gotta come buy more.  Well, not in the new building, because I'm not going to let any of you fuckers up there.  I gotta make a delivery.  One.  Let me go to Bob in Philly.  He says we're missing another rule of let's make a deal.  Bob in Philly.  Hey there, Bab.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to remind you, in let's make a deal, you could trade the gift or the prize that you won for what's behind a curtain, 
[02:03:00]  and it could be something really shitty or embarrassing that they would have to do.  Trust me, we're giving away shit already.  Yeah, I know.  We'd actually have to have shit behind the curtain.  Yeah.  It was called the Zonk when they would open it up, and instead of having a nice radar range back there,  there would be a fucking, you know, a mule or something.  Donkey prize.  Yeah, we have the same thing.  Or like a pile of spam in a can or something dumb, right?  Yeah.  Oh.  Hey, Pat.  I love spam.  It's time to give away our first item.  So once again, what have we got to give away to this audience? 
[02:03:30]  Hit the game show music, please.  Oh.  Go ahead, Pat.  Uh, we have today, we have a XM bag that Carol Merrill is molesting, and a shocker foam Grand Theft Auto thing.  And, uh, also a free FM fleece.  You know, fleece, fleece.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Stop the game show music.  I'm remembering something else.  Yeah.  The host was not the announcer. 
[02:04:00]  Ah.  So we have Carol Merrill, we have the host.  Right.  Who will then go out and work with the crowd.  But the announcer was always the guy with the announcer voice to tell what it was.  We're down to Bobo or Dave, aren't we?  What about Tank?  Yeah.  There's always Big A.  Tankerous.  Tankerous.  No, Big A and Twitchell's.  Big A is the person.  Big A is the person.  I didn't know he was here.  Yes, Big A.  A Big A.  A Big A.  A Big A.  A Big A.  What did I tell you about vertical stripes? 
[02:04:30]  More slimming.  Yeah.  You asshole.  Yeah, you gotta go.  The stripes gotta go the other way, Big A.  What is this?  Let's make a meal?  Big A, you're gonna be the announcer.  So you gotta use your deep voice.  We all know you got that.  Try out your deep voice on Jeffrey Ross, will ya?  Welcome to Let's Make a Deal.  Hey, not bad.  How big is?  I'm confident. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, of course he is.  He's good.  And Pat, you got the item picked out?  Uh, yes.  You can't ask the crowd if they have a father on that, by the way.  Oh, no, no, no.  Well, I work for the show.  I can't win it anyway.  Wow.  See, Jeffrey, he doesn't have a father because...  Well, he does somewhere about a mile away from him, but he won't see him.  He abandoned him.  Restraining orders makes it difficult to visit.  That's tough.  But we learned that Pat does drive by the really nice house that his father keeps. 
[02:05:30]  That's right.  Well, it's on the way to my trailer.  Yeah.  Which is the end of the runway at Teterboro.  Yeah.  Right.  Have you ever tried to do an intervention, get them together?  We'd love to.  Ugh.  Well, that's uncomfortable.  All right.  So the Let's Make a Deal, if I recall, the audience had crazy costumes on.  As far as the father's concerned, Pat's a load that just keeps knocking on the front door.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Sorry, Pat.  Awesome deal.  It's like the wrestler.  You know what?  Yeah.  You know what, Jeffrey?  You're right.  And we're going to be doing Let's Make a Deal all next week. 
[02:06:00]  So we're encouraging the listeners, if they stop by, to see the radio show, that they come  in costume.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  They're not already in costume.  We're just...  Thank you.  We're just getting the Let's Make a Deal bit going today.  But next week, we want to be all in.  So we want you to show up in costumes and with a lot of stuff that we might be asking  for.  Like decks of cards.  All that stuff.  You never know.  Old O&A stuff.  Perfect.  Jeffrey Ross, thank God you're here today to pump this shit up. 
[02:06:30]  I love Let's Make a Deal.  I used to love that show.  Well, we got to go with what we got today.  No costumes in the audience and just a bunch of probably crap.  So are we ready now, Ann, now that we got the announcer?  Yes.  You're the big TV guy.  So what do we do?  We go to the game show music and then we have Big A do what?  Big A should probably announce the host of the show.  And then...  We should probably switch mics because he's going to be announcing it.  I'm going to be working the crowd. 
[02:07:00]  Holy shit.  That was more of a visual.  Switch mics.  He did the visual for working the crowd with his one hand.  All right.  They have switched mics.  Just say something like, ladies and gentlemen, let's make a deal.  And Sam...  With your host...  Well, and also I just want to say...  Piece of shit.  It looks like they're also doing the weather.  Yeah.  Sam, you've got to be the floor director, too.  You've got to cue the audience when they're supposed to applaud and stuff to really get this game show rolling.  Are we ready, Ann?  We are ready. 
[02:07:30]  Game show music.  Big A.  Let's welcome to Let's Make a Deal with our host, Pat from Hunaki.  Perfect.  Hey, everybody.  We're going to see who's going to make a deal for a lovely XM bag who our lovely Carol Bech is showing off for the audience, which contains a free FM fleece. 
[02:08:00]  No, now you go, Big A, why don't you tell them what they could win?  Hey, Big A, tell them what they could win.  Hold on, hold on.  Stop the game show music.  I was going really well.  When Big A announces you, now you've got to kind of work the crowd just for a little bit, get the excitement level up, and then Big A will go to what they could win.  Okay.  How are we doing?  Everybody ready to win some prizes?  It's going to be fantastic.  All right, here we go.  Just going to go out into the crowd.  Hey, everybody.  How's it going?  No, no, no. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, okay.  All right.  Who do we got here?  Who's got some interesting...  He's stocking it all up.  We were going to go for a retake.  Oh, jeez.  We're doing a retake, Pat.  And you don't have to ask what kind of stuff.  Just get excited.  Are you ready to play?  Are you ready to play?  Let's make a deal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, everybody ready to play?  No, no, not yet.  Not yet.  We're doing it.  Holy shit.  Wait for the music and then the intro again.  All right, here we go.  By Big A, and then you introduce Carol Merrill.  By the way, Jeffrey Ross is here.  He's playing the Stress Factory all weekend long. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, thank you.  He's wishing he didn't show up today.  It's all mine.  But he's got to get his plugs.  I'm getting a little stressed myself.  I'm getting some belly fat growing.  This is fun.  I've never been to a funeral for a radio studio before.  All right, hit the game show music.  Here we go again.  Welcome to Let's Make a Deal with our host, Pat, Pat, from Anaki.  Hey, everybody. 
[02:09:30]  How you doing?  Hey, Big A, tell them what they could win today.  I think I just fucked that up.  Oh, my God.  This would be the third and final take.  Whatever happens here has to go.  Didn't we tell you you're like the Jeffrey Ross knows?  Pat's horrible.  You're like the roast master.  You're the guy.  I see you, like, take over the room.  You have to take over the room in a mere, like, just give it 10 or 15 seconds of trying  to take over the room.  Get the excitement up for the big game that's about to happen. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, okay.  Work your hips.  Take a deep breath.  Yeah.  Move it around a little bit.  And then when you finish working the crowd, you have to end it with, and we have a fabulous  prize, first prize up.  Big A, why don't you tell us about it?  And then Big A describes the prize as Stalker.  Yeah.  I like that name, Stalker.  Yeah.  She does her movements, and you've got to show off the prize to the audience. 
[02:10:30]  Right.  You got it now?  Okay.  I'm pretty sure I can fuck it up again.  Everybody.  All right.  And this is it.  Whatever happens, we're going to go with this, okay?  We're going.  All right.  And you got the item picked out in your head?  No, I mean that you're asking the crowd for.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  He asked for specific things.  Right.  Do you have one thing you got in your head?  Ah, okay.  A dollar bill, a condom.  A unique keychain.  No, because every keychain is a bit unique. 
[02:11:00]  It's got different keys on it.  Okay.  Like it would have been like a rabbit keychain.  A rabbit foot keychain or whatever.  Right.  It has to be specific, but something unique that they might just have, Pat.  Or a sofa bed.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  This is the third and final take.  Whatever happens, happens.  The game on.  Start the music.  Welcome to Let's Make a Deal with our host, Pat, uh, Pat Kuminaki. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, everybody.  Welcome to Let's Make a Deal.  Hey, we got a bunch of lovely prizes you could win, but you have to have certain items that  I am looking for, and you're going to win a lovely prize.  Hey, Big A.  Tell them about the prizes we have to win today.  We have a lovely XM bag, and GTA, um, um, foam hand, and, uh, as I am, you will talk 
[02:12:00]  fleece.  And a picture of Kurt Angle and Big Hit.  Okay.  Thanks, Big A. We'll be hearing from Big A real soon.  Uh, hey, what are we having a crowd today?  Sir?  Nice to meet you. 
[02:12:30]  Uh, tell me a little about for yourself.  No, not really.  Hey, does anybody in the crowd have, uh, a pack of matches from a restaurant?  Oh, nice.  Yeah, through that restaurant.  Very specific.  First one to show that, Pat, gets the prize.  Come on, first one that has it gets this lovely prize.  The world's fighting each other.  Where are we?  The Sands?  Matches. 
[02:13:00]  From the Stork Club.  I'm looking for matches from the Stork Club.  All right.  Well, forget the matches.  From the Overlook Hotel.  We're looking for a vagina.  Oh, hey, okay.  Hello.  Yes, I can't play.  Wait.  You're going to have to show that vagina.  Oh, Pat's working it.  Well, never mind.  Well, inappropriate.  All right.  How about another item, Pat?  Okay.  How about...  A black friend. 
[02:13:30]  Not really.  Okay.  How about another item?  How about a...  Five bucks.  Does anyone there even have five bucks?  I'm not very creative.  So much for my improv skills.  Hey, how about you?  I'm going to ask your co-host for a little help.  She's got some improv skills.  Maybe she can think of something.  Oh, there you go.  Do you have any ideas what the crowd could come up with for this lovely prize that you've  been showing off?  Here we go.  And lowering the value of. 
[02:14:00]  Does anybody have a train pass other than a Metro card?  Oh, here we go.  We have a gentleman.  Ah, you're very disappointing.  That's like me to my father.  Pat, we might have...  Oh, here we go.  We have a Metro Smart Trip card.  Sir, tell me what your name is.  Alex.  Hi, Alex.  You've won XM bag with a shocker. 
[02:14:30]  Congratulations.  And thanks for...  And thanks...  That bag has a Velcro clothes on it, mind you.  Thanks for the Metro card.  It's probably worth five times the bag.  No, he gets to keep it.  There you go.  All right, Pat, you got to wrap up the show.  Okay, who else wants to make a deal?  Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what I need.  No, no, no, no.  We don't know what the next prize is.  Just say...  A hair clip.  No, no, Pat.  No, Pat.  Oh, we got to get an item.  No, Pat.  Yeah, Pat. 
[02:15:00]  Jeffrey Ross is leaving the show.  Pat.  Say thanks for playing Let's Make a Deal.  And then throw it back to Big A.  And then Big A says, you know, you've been listening to Let's Make a Deal with your host.  And do the closure.  Okay, thanks, everybody, for playing Let's Make a Deal.  Hey, Big A.  What's up next?  No.  No, no.  Big A, just close the show now.  You're finishing.  Have you been listening to Let's Make a Deal with our host, Pat Uminaki? 
[02:15:30]  And our sponsors.  What about our sponsors?  I hope I passed the audition.  What about our sponsors?  Thank the sponsors.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank our sponsors.  Patty, why don't you jump in?  Remember some of the sponsors?  The Spiegel catalog?  Yeah.  60609.  The Stress Factory?  New Brunswick?  Yeah, Stress Factory.  All right.  Patty.  Cut to music.  All right.  That was pretty good.  A pretty good dry run.  We're going to do another segment.  Oh, are you listening, too?  We're going to do another segment. 
[02:16:00]  I thought you did great.  Yeah, we're going to do another Let's Make a Deal in about 15, 20 minutes.  We've got other prizes to give away.  We've got the Frank Sinatra fucking poster we've given away today.  That's a cool poster.  That's a big one.  And that's from Frank's place for the people that linger longer.  Oh, all right.  And we also have...  The Larry the Cable Guy DVD over there.  Do we have Larry?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to throw that in.  And Sam, what is that?  What is that painting or what is that?  This is Needlepoint, I think it's called.  Needlepoint of a Naked Woman.  It's a naked woman and it comes with a free wow sticker covering her breasts. 
[02:16:30]  Well, I covered it for the picture because, you know, no nudity on Twitter.  But you can take the wow sticker off now.  That means Opie has touched the wow sticker.  So it comes with a free wow sticker that Opie touched.  Oh, all right.  That'll bring it down to another five cents.  Yeah, sure.  He goes on Hebebe.  And what's that?  And we got a snowboard, too?  No, this is a skateboard with no wheels.  Oh, that's why I thought it was a snowboard.  And it's signed by Alien Ant Farm.  The hit band.  Isn't that pretty much what a snowboard is? 
[02:17:00]  A skateboard with no wheels?  If you think about it, really.  It's a misfit toy.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  So we're going to, like, gather a bunch of stuff for the next Let's Make a Deal segment.  How cool will you look in the half pipe with an Alien Ant Farm skateboard, by the way?  All the kids love Alien Ant Farm.  Not cool at all.  What was that big song?  It was the cover of the Michael Jackson song.  Smooth Criminal.  Smooth Criminal.  Thank you, Jeffrey.  I believe the logo's on the bottom of the board.  Well, that's what they do.  Because when you're catching air, people can see it. 
[02:17:30]  Okay, I got it.  There's not one person in his audience who can snowboard.  It's a skateboard.  It's a skateboard.  Or a skateboard.  It's a skateboard without wheels.  Because it's only the best for our listeners.  Yeah, buy your own wheels, fuckers.  Right.  There's no grip tape on top.  Oh, no grip tape.  Perfect.  So maybe E-Rock should find some better stuff from our office.  It's a good fixer-upper.  If we're going to keep this bit going.  I think Carol Merrill just yawned.  Are you all right?  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  You need some Starbucks, doll?  No, I just had a cup of coffee. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, Patty, have we ever made you sing Rush?  Considering you look like Geddy Lee.  Yeah, the hair now is really...  I don't know any songs.  Or Ramones.  Can we get the lyrics to Tom Sawyer?  She looks like Joey Ramone, if anybody.  Yeah.  When we get back...  When did Joey Ramone and Geddy Lee have a baby?  Yeah.  That's it.  When we get back, Patty's going to sing Tom Sawyer for everybody.  Jeffrey Ross is going to continue.  He's at the Stress Factory this weekend.  And we also have Big A and Twitchels here to do maybe some news.  We got David and Bobo. 
[02:18:30]  You want another Bobo Springsteen as we go to break?  No.  All right.  Patty's Joey alone.  All right.  That was marginal.  We're going to go to break with Jeffrey Ross roasting Larry the Cable Guy.  This is my intelligence.  Well, why don't you keep talking?  It's all right.  We're going to break with Jeffrey Ross roasting Larry the Cable Guy.  Can I just say one thing about that?  Yeah.  I was so inspired by roasting that redneck retard that I've been bringing a podium on stage 
[02:19:00]  at my stand-up shows and speed roasting people from the audience.  That's a very good idea.  Really?  I like that.  I've been inspired this weekend and tried a new thing.  That's very cool.  I would love to see that.  Thanks for letting me get the word out.  Damn.  And warming up on your crowd, too.  I do the same thing with meat.  What do you mean, Pat?  Speed roast.  You got it.  I know.  Oh, God.  I kind of liked it.  A speed roast, Joe.  Oh, thank you.  That was good. 
[02:19:30]  My heart.  We go to break.  And then it ends with this.  All right, listen.  Jeffrey Ross roasting Larry the Cable Guy as we go to break here.  This is so fun.  Gary Busey.  Wow.  How you doing, man?  Good.  I love you, Gary.  You're like Mickey Rourke without the comeback.  I'm confused. 
[02:20:00]  Are we both some Larry the Cable Guy or Gary the Unstable Guy?  Oh, this is a lot of fun.  This is ridiculous.  Not even a real person.  How come nobody talks about your other personas you tried out that didn't work out so well?  You know, like Dan the Comedian.  Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  Of course, I first discovered Larry the Cable Guy when he was part of the blue-collar comedy 
[02:20:30]  tour.  You guys remember that?  Yeah.  Why did you guys break up?  Uncreative differences?  This is like shooting fish in a Cracker Barrel.  Yeah.  Larry's last show had an eight-drink minimum and a two-teeth maximum.  My real Cable Guy, Donald, is funnier than you. 
[02:21:00]  And you know, get her done wasn't even Larry's first choice for a catchphrase, but some other  lucky inbred already used, mission accomplished.  Oh, Jeff Foxworthy, great to see you.  Look at that mustache, like a confederate porn star.  Who are you, Stonewall Jackoff?  And folks, in case you haven't read Larry's book, it's also called Get Her Done, because 
[02:21:30]  after three pages, you want to put her down.  It's an easy read, mostly just pictures of sandwiches he f***ed on the road.  Oh, come on, we all know Larry's a freak.  In fact, he's f***ed so many farm animals down south, they call him Larry the Stable Guy.  Larry, remember, nay means nay.  In case you don't know it, Larry comes from a show business family. 
[02:22:00]  In fact, his dad was the banjo player from Deliverance.  But what you don't know is that his mom played the guy who f***ed Ned Beatty.  He sure got a pretty mouth, don't he?  In closing, I'd just like to say to all of you. 
[02:22:30]  Ask not what your country can get her done for you.  Ask how this hillbilly moron made $30 million last year.  Congratulations, my flannel-wearing friend.  I love you.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Jeffrey Ross, Stress Factory, all weekend long. 
[02:23:00]  And I just heard that Jeffrey's going to be doing a little more Dancing with the Stars.  They invited you back to do the roast thing?  Yeah, they're going to have me roast the finalists on the finale all over again, like I did last time.  That's fucking huge.  Screw that dancing crap.  That's when Chris Rock called me up, he said,  Fuck the dancing, Ross.  Tell some jokes.  Yeah, and now you get to do that.  Now you get to do it.  Because that was cool last year when you came back and did it.  I saw it.  It was amazing.  That was the highest, most watched roast in human history.  26 million people. 
[02:23:30]  Jesus Christ.  That's fucking Christ.  Do it all over again.  I'm twittering to a couple thousand.  Who'd you roast?  I roasted the three finalists were Lance Bass, Warren Sapp, and Brooke Burke.  Yeah, but you got some Cloris Leachman jokes in there.  I worked it.  You worked in the Cloris Leachman thing?  Cloris Leachman.  I said she wasn't even dancing.  Her partner just dragged her lifeless body around the dance floor, like a weekend at Bernie's  the musical.  Did you hear a laugh?  Big laugh.  It was great.  Much bigger than the last.  It was crazy because I never did a clean roast and I never killed that hard. 
[02:24:00]  There were kids in the audience, but I was just doing fat jokes about Warren Sapp and it  was almost better.  And that's all it took, right?  Yeah.  I said, Warren Sapp, how do you dance all day, every day for two months and stay so out of  shape.  That's funny.  That's good.  Who are you going to roast this year?  Whoever the three finalists are.  Oh, yeah, I know you.  So we won't know until that week.  You know, you were the one that made me watch last season.  I ain't watching that shit.  It does.  It's a little ridiculous.  I don't even know who's on this year.  Steve-O.  Oh, that's right.  Steve-O. 
[02:24:30]  David Allen Greer.  Ooh.  I talked him into doing it.  He was reluctant.  David Allen Greer, huh?  Steve-O.  I want to be good for his career.  Steve-O.  Todd?  Well, not really.  He's in, like, he's...  He's like debonair.  He's like a...  Yeah, he worked in the circus and all that.  Steve did?  Steve-O did.  Yeah.  The thing for me is, like...  He took stunt, what, stuntman classes.  I think he could do pretty well with that career.  The thing about Steve-O is the same reason I did it is, like, back in the day, comedians  were showmen. 
[02:25:00]  They could sing and dance, so it's like a paying homage to the Roastmasters who came before  us.  They're setting up the studio for the next Let's Make a Deal giveaway.  Now we got boxes and everything.  I mean, we are going all in now, and...  Really kind of getting extravagant.  We're going to get to that in a minute, but we have other things to do.  We got Bobo.  I think we're ready for another Bobo Springsteen.  Do you guys want to hear another Bobo Springsteen?  Wow.  We need an angle.  Oh, look at those people.  They're just...  How about a little Springsteen?  I'm on fire, like a sexy one. 
[02:25:30]  Literally light him on fire.  Now you're asking too much from our listeners.  I was driving down...  Oh, all right.  Go ahead, Bobo.  I was driving down the Jersey Turnpike.  I had to go really bad, so I relieved myself in Jersey.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  He relieved himself in Jersey.  Wow.  All right.  We like to give you thought stars, but he went on his own there, which is... 
[02:26:00]  Is that Bruce Springsteen's daughter's horse singing?  Hey, remember the Des Moines radio show?  Remember?  Do you remember?  Yeah, we listened to these guys.  They were...  What was it?  Cursing, right?  One guy was in the background during a commercial break, and he was just cursing up a storm.  Yeah, we got about 40 seconds.  I mean, we had a lot of audio of these guys.  We predicted their future, I think.  Yeah, we got an update on these guys.  For Jeffrey Ross, they went to commercial, they thought.  At this radio show?  Yeah.  Their mics were still on, and they were motherfucking each other. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  Over credentials for a high school basketball game.  Listen to this.  We got just a taste.  Now at the Home Depot, carpet installation is just $139.  Any size home, no matter how many rooms.  That's hundreds in savings.  And you're not done yet.  New lower prices on carpet, and $139 basic installation.  More savings.  The votes have been counted.  The measure has passed.  Sports is the official language of Des Moines Sports Station, 1460 KXNR. 
[02:27:00]  All right, good morning, Central Iowa.  Hope your brackets look a heck of a...  And then they go right into the show after this.  Fuck you, you motherfucker.  So Ant and I know a little bit about radio there, Jeffrey Ross, and we predicted their future, yes.  We pretty much said so fired, so completely and utterly fired, they had gotten suspended.  And, of course, the suspension is just so they can, as Opie has pointed out, just so they can find out everyone that was involved, so they could fire everyone. 
[02:27:30]  If they just fire a couple of guys right off the bat, then what fun is that?  There might be a couple of people roaming around that had something to do with it.  Yeah.  Holy shit, you can't have that happen.  They don't want to pull them off on the air, leave one guy on the air who can diss the whole thing.  Oh, they got a clean house.  Yeah.  I think it was obvious to even the listeners, everybody fired.  But in actuality, it was an engineer's fault for leaving the mic. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, somebody fucked up leaving the mic.  I mean, everybody curses up during commercials.  I agree with you, but here's the problem.  The FCC doesn't listen to that, so the company has to take responsibility and go, look, look.  It was one of those situations.  We fired everybody.  Please don't find us.  Please don't find us.  Yep.  We took care of the problem.  Right.  They always want to just make sure that they look good in the FCC eyes.  That's why the paddles are working out for you guys.  Paddles.  Yes, paddles.  We're still green, by the way.  Green.  We're all green right now.  Des Moines sports radio personality.  Listen to this guy.  I thought we have had some firings in the past, right? 
[02:28:30]  This guy, Marty Terrell, lost two jobs Wednesday.  His afternoon radio show and his weekly television TV commentary job.  Are you kidding?  And he still might lose a third as a result of a profane on-air argument with fellow broadcaster  Larry Kotler.  Clear Channel officials announced that Terrell, who co-hosts the Marty and Miller program,  have been fired along with Kotler, the host of...  Marty and Motherfucker show.  ...has been fired along with Kotler, the host of Kotler and Company. 
[02:29:00]  So this took out two shows.  Wow.  Well, obviously, if these guys were a massive hit, this wouldn't be happening.  It was a technical error.  Honestly, no.  That still would happen.  If that's an FCC violation, that would absolutely still happen.  Yeah.  Even on a hit show.  Board operator sucks.  The whole show goes down?  Yeah.  $300-and-something-thousand-dollar fine for the FCC.  Yeah, $325 or something.  They don't play good.  Per curse, by the way.  Wait, per curse.  Yeah, per instance.  So that was cha-ching, cha-ching.  I forgot how many curses.  I think there was at least a dozen.  So that's...  We're talking millions. 
[02:29:30]  And then they took out Jeff Kahn, an assistant program manager for the station.  He had to go, too.  What did he have to do with it?  He wasn't in there pushing buttons.  He's a lieutenant that has to take the fall for the platoon.  Plus, it was his responsibility to make sure that stuff didn't go out over the air.  Yeah.  I guess.  I'm happy to see someone in management go, good, fuck him.  Meanwhile, Dave Busek, news director for the TV station, said Wednesday that Terrell's  weekly sports commentary mouth to the Midwest had been canceled.  He declined further comment. 
[02:30:00]  You kidding me?  This guy now got exposure.  Now people are watching the guy that was cursing on the radio.  They probably look at it the other way like he doesn't have a radio show to plug his TV  show with.  Oh, you think?  Go away.  Raw deal, if you ask me.  Yeah.  Well, Terrell declined comment when contacted.  Of course he did.  While I'm disappointed by the decision, I know Clear Channel did what they thought they  needed to do, Terrell said in a statement.  I've remained quiet for the past few days so Clear Channel can make their decision.  That said, I've been eager to publicly apologize.  Oh.  Specifically, I would like to apologize to Larry Collar for the way I treated him. 
[02:30:30]  He deserved better.  I would also like to apologize to anyone who heard the comments on the radio, to Bud Legg  and blah, blah, blah.  You think a male-dominated or oriented show.  It's a sports fucking talk show, right?  Yeah.  Who is getting offended by hearing the word fuck?  Nobody.  Please.  Stop it.  Stop with your apologizing.  Maybe the soccer mom that, oops, I slipped on your channel.  I love when they say that crap.  I want to reiterate what we say all the time when these stories come up. 
[02:31:00]  If you ever hear us apologize on the air, we absolutely don't mean it.  So as we're saying it, oh, I'm getting green pal.  It's a green pal.  Green pal.  As we're saying it, if it ever happens in the future, know that we honestly do not mean  a word of the apology, no matter how sincere it sounds.  And why is that, Ant?  Uh, well, because management let, oh, shit.  Red paddle.  Red paddle.  I'll shut up. 
[02:31:30]  Wow, you're like trained like a gerbil in a cage.  Yes.  I'm Pavlov's idiot.  See the chemistry between you and I?  Yes.  We worked that bit perfectly.  I set you up.  You went with it, and then the red paddle.  Yay.  Nothing kills on the radio like visuals.  I know.  Like the colored paddles.  All right.  Enough of that.  So those guys, like we told everyone, got fired.  It's official.  And what do we say?  The firing always happens on a Friday.  Yep.  There you go.  This followed suit perfectly.  Although it hits the news on Friday.  They probably fired him yesterday.  We know how this works. 
[02:32:00]  Perfect.  Not exactly what they're even fighting about.  What's even controversial arguments?  High school credentials to a high school basketball game, Jeff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They wanted to get rid of these guys.  This was the excuse management was looking for.  That's all.  It kind of does sound a little like that.  They were done, and they had to get rid of them.  Yeah.  Is there a VIP section at a basketball game?  You know what the listeners just heard?  I think one of those.  Basketball game?  Yeah.  Why don't you start again there, Pat?  What?  I said, is there even a VIP section?  I should have known. 
[02:32:30]  Sounds like one of them was pissed he couldn't get in the locker rooms.  Just focus on let's make a deal, because now we're making this game very complicated.  We've got boxes, so now they can trade in the prizes.  Call them young ladies.  I'm not very good at multitasking.  There's no reason to be the other.  I want to cut this off at the pass.  His batteries.  Thank you, Paul.  That's why you are the greatest intern.  Wow.  Thanks, Paul.  Paul realized.  We should have realized when Bobo was doing Bobo Springsteen. 
[02:33:00]  He's still an intern?  Yeah.  15 years he's here as an intern?  He's not the oldest intern, though.  We've got a 39-year-old.  Really?  Yes, for real.  All right.  Are we ready for Stalker Patty to sing Rush, Tom Sawyer?  Absolutely.  We're doing a variety show today for you, Jeffrey.  I appreciate that.  You know I'm old school.  All for you.  It's the variety show format, really.  We bring in various celebrities from the show, and they go in song and dance numbers.  Look what I just did.  What did you do?  Look what I just did for us. 
[02:33:30]  What?  The Opie and Anthony Variety Show.  Opie and Anthony Variety Show.  Coming soon.  Can we do it for the big final show next Friday?  Wow.  Who wants to be part of the Opie and Anthony Variety Show?  Jimmy, would you do a little something?  I have a song.  I actually have a song I wrote.  Shut up, Patty.  No, no, no.  That's okay.  What were you saying, Patty?  I was going to talk about a song, but you just jumped all over.  You talk.  No, no.  I'm sorry.  No, it's okay.  All right, Steve.  Where's Steve?  Steve!  Steve, get a promo on the air. 
[02:34:00]  Next Friday, the big last live show is the Opie and Anthony Variety Show.  Anyone could do something.  Sam, do you think you might have something for the Variety Show?  Of course.  I always do.  We need musical numbers.  We need comedy sketches.  Tap dancers.  Everything.  A juggler.  Something like that.  Ross, you want to come back next Friday for the big O&A Variety Show?  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  So now it's up to the O&A community and us to come to the table, and Ant and I will decide 
[02:34:30]  which acts are going to make it.  Okay?  Yeah.  Should I try to book Eastside Dave for a musical number or something?  I like the idea.  That would be good.  He's a celebrity.  Anything goes.  But we don't want heavy on the music.  We want a little comedy, like Ant said, some sketch.  We need, like, a coochie-coochie girl, like Charo.  Right.  I bet Eastside Dave could ride a unicycle.  Oh, shit.  Something like that.  For real?  I would assume he can.  You know what?  Eastside Dave will be riding a unicycle as part of the O&A Variety Show.  To fly to the bumblebee as the background music.  Yes, yes.  It's got to be real old school cheese. 
[02:35:00]  Let's keep track of this.  Let's start riding this out.  Nice.  I like that.  Maybe a magic trick?  Magic act.  I do magic act.  Anything goes.  Pat, if you come up with something, you call the show next week, and we decide if it's  going to fly on the O&A Variety Show.  I can make a tongue disappear.  Oof.  No jokes.  Your dad made you disappear.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  He wasn't there in the first place.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, no.  He has no relationship with his father.  So far, we're intern day free.  It's an intern day free zone.  Yeah, it really is.  He was on today.  A little bit.  He was on today with the pretzels.  Oh, shit.  You got a big crowd here today.  Oh, yeah.  It's only going to get bigger as the week goes on, and next Friday, the big show.  Yes.  David?  Big Variety.  Here comes David.  Have you met David yet, Jeffrey Ross?  Yeah, briefly.  Nice to see you again.  Nice to see you, Jeff.  I met him a couple of times, yes.  You tried to get me breakfast, but Big Ken cut him off.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:36:00]  Thanks, David.  Thank you.  You know your popularity's waning.  Oh, shit.  I know that.  Yes, I know that.  He looks like one of the characters on The Simpsons.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  Millhouse.  Millhouse.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I don't think so.  Fuck.  What's your Millhouse thing going on?  It's been hanging with us for months, and we didn't come up with the Millhouse thing.  I don't think David's popularity is waning at all.  As far as I'm concerned, you're as popular as ever.  Why, thank you, Jimmy.  Why did Dan Natterman and Millhouse have a baby?  Punch him in the face.  Dan Natterman.  You can see a little of that, right? 
[02:36:30]  I call those breeders.  Cross breeders.  Yes.  I've named them.  David, I think you have a few stars on the rise, as far as I'm concerned.  Why, thank you, Jimmy.  Let's hear it for David.  David.  Oh, boy.  Well, let me try this out, though.  Let's hear it for Bobo.  Bobo takes his hat off like he's playing in the old-timers game.  Yeah, he did a curtain call.  Came out of the dugout.  Jerry Grody.  He pointed to the studio. 
[02:37:00]  Jerry Grody.  Thurman, dumb son.  Topical.  Oh, fuck, that's funny.  All right.  Jesus.  Died in 79.  Sam, make sure Eastside Dave knows that he is riding a unicycle as the grand finale to  the O&A Variety Show next Friday.  One week from today.  I don't even give a shit if he's ever rode one.  No, I would just say, I think he, I'm sure he can ride one.  All right, that's very good.  With or without the seat.  We all know Dave.  All right, and Patty, you're going to set up the big O&A Variety Show by doing a little 
[02:37:30]  rush for everybody today, okay?  All right.  This is kind of the thing we're going to be doing next week.  It's like a promo.  Yeah.  It's almost like a little trailer for it.  Yeah, you want to get up on the stage?  Yeah, get up on the stage there.  Get up on the stage.  Patty, you need to set up the pal-talk camera.  Oh, that's okay.  I don't think anyone really wants to see her.  Yeah.  All right, there we go.  She looks good today.  You look good, Patty.  No, she doesn't.  Your nips are blazing.  She looks good. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, she really are.  You do have some nipples showing, Patty.  What's up with that shit?  Why are your nipples popping out?  What's up with that shit?  I'm not wearing a bra.  Wow, what a whore.  You don't wear a bra.  You never wear one, right?  I don't have anything there.  Well, that's why they're fucking going to stand right now.  She doesn't wear a hat.  You look like Rich Voss in the 80s.  Oh, God damn.  Jesus.  Very good.  Same hairstyle.  With the long hair and when he had bad teeth.  Look at him. 
[02:38:30]  I can read Patty.  She wants to do this topless for everyone.  You can, Patty.  No.  You can do the Rush song topless for everybody.  No.  Microphone, Patty.  No, no.  We got to have stuff around the studio.  Here we go.  Big show.  Catch a rising Starbucks.  When David rides the unicycle.  A lot of stuff around.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He might knock into it, though.  Cans.  Lots of cans.  Barbed wire and upturned punji sticks.  Patty looks like she's in a putty booth with everybody watching. 
[02:39:00]  You want to tag that with anything else there, Pat?  Oh, boy.  Putty booth.  Behind glass.  Behind glass.  Yeah.  Good night expression.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Patty.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Patty will sing.  Tom Sawyer.  For everybody.  For everybody.  A modern-day warrior, mean, mean stride.  Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, my God.  Wait.  Did she hit the post?  We're a little confused.  I did.  Yeah, I think she got it.  I think she did, right?  Yeah, she got it.  She hit the pole.  Do you know?  Yeah.  I've never known the lyrics to this.  I swear to you.  I, for all these years, thought it was.  And I knew it didn't make sense.  A Monday warrior?  I knew that never made sense.  I never knew that was a modern-day warrior.  Why would you be a Monday warrior?  I don't know.  Maybe that you would.  Who knows?  I think I went with Monday warrior, too, Jimmy.  A mundane warrior.  A Monday warrior. 
[02:40:00]  I knew that didn't make sense.  Yes.  I like that.  All right.  Here we go, Patty.  Now you learned some more words from Patty.  Someone suggested.  Well, it's Kevin, who's the number one feedbacker these days.  Kevin from Connecticut writes,  Patty should sing Lane Light.  Patty, Patty, this time sing Mochaccino Warrior.  Make it yours.  A modern-day warrior.  Mean, mean stride. 
[02:40:30]  Today's Tom Sawyer.  Mean, mean pride.  It was mine.  It's not for rent.  No.  Now.  It's not for rent.  She said, I don't.  You missed it.  She was right, actually.  No, she wasn't.  Really?  Yeah, she came in one half a thing too early.  I would have to hear the lyrics while I'm singing it.  She came in one half a thing too early. 
[02:41:00]  And you want to point to her?  What?  You want to give her a little direction, or it doesn't matter?  Yeah.  She was doing okay.  It's just that the cadence is...  What up, Patty?  You're so rude.  The cadence is what?  They're very irregular, like, number of beats.  Yeah, but it's still got a fucking, you know, you've still got the one, two, three, four  shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, but if they don't follow that rule...  All right, Geddy.  Now you're all getting an attitude, you prima donna.  No.  You know what?  I thought we were done with the Rush jokes, but we're not.  Chris C. from Virginia writes, she should sing YYZ. 
[02:41:30]  YYY.  YYY.  All right, Patty.  Geddy off the stage, Lee.  All right, here we go, Patty.  All right, one more time.  I can't think of a Red Barchetta joke, and I'm trying.  I was trying so hard with Red Barchetta.  That's toughy.  Yeah.  All right.  Do it again.  Come on.  Someone wants Patty to lose her virginity officially on the big O&A variety show that's going down  next Friday.  That'll be good.  That won't be happening. 
[02:42:00]  Who's fucking you, Patty?  Nobody.  What do you want, black, white?  No.  Nobody.  Can we finger pop you?  No.  In the shitter?  In the shitter.  What about your shitter?  Here, you hold on to that pussy like it's gold.  What about the shitter?  Yeah.  No.  I'm a complete virgin.  No, you're not.  Let's play who could get duty on their finger from finger popping Patty in the ass.  After a lot of coffee.  That's disgusting.  But everyone lines up, and they take their chance.  They stick their digit in.  They come out. 
[02:42:30]  Nope.  No duty for me.  All muddy fingernails.  Even after you wash your hands, you still got a little mud under the fingernails.  Whoever finds a book of matches wins something.  All right, here we go, Patty.  This is you.  It's all you.  Let's go.  A modern-day warrior, mean, mean stride.  Taste on soy of mean, mean pride.  Though it's mine to snap for rent, don't put him down this arrogant. 
[02:43:00]  This piece of a quiet defense, riding out today's events.  The real star.  Oh, that's her own version. 
[02:43:30]  I think she's doing great.  No, no, yeah.  What's she say about a company?  It's what she say about a side teeth.  Catch the mist.  Catch the mist.  Catch the mystery.  Catch the drift.  Catch the mist. 
[02:44:00]  Now.  Now.  Now for it.  I like Patty's version.  You do?  I do.  It's weird.  I hate it. 
[02:44:30]  No!  No!  This is going great.  Big musical interlude here.  My God.  This is the karaoke version?  Yeah.  This is where you can stand there all awkwardly because there's a fucking huge instrumental. 
[02:45:00]  Just start drinking your beer in front of everybody.  Is this shit just played up in Canada 24 hours a day?  Yeah.  Big Neil Perch solo here.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Go, Neil.  That was you. 
[02:45:30]  Go.  Next time it's going, he gets high on you.  Oh, boy.  Now she's awesome.  Why don't we do the Brady Bunch ending where the music fades and you just bow.  Yeah.  The real Brady Bunch ending.  Oh, you're lost now. 
[02:46:00]  Hey, the big finish.  Come on.  So it's mine.  It's not for me.  No.  No.  What you say about his company is what...  Yeah.  Try again.  Go ahead.  What you say about his company?  No, no, no.  Not there.  What you say about the Stress Factory?  Oh, no.  Oh, Jeffrey Ross.  I got it. 
[02:46:30]  Big finish.  No.  No, no.  That's...  Come on.  Today's Tom Sawyer.  He gets high on you.  No.  No.  Go.  Today's Tom Sawyer.  He gets high on you.  The energy trade.  He gets right on to the friction of the day.  No, no.  No, no.  That's not...  I just like fucking her up by throwing lyrics at her.  The big finish.  Go.  Right here.  Go.  Modern Day Warrior.  Yep.  Modern Day Warrior.  Meet me. 
[02:47:00]  How to go.  Right now.  Go.  And one.  Modern Day Warrior.  No.  No.  You fell for it again.  What is it?  Oh.  No, that's not it.  You fell for it.  All right.  Wait.  Really.  The world.  One, two, three, four, and go.  Go.  The world.  The world.  Come on.  The world is love and love.  Oh, Patty.  You screwed it all up.  You do.  I am so not familiar with the musical.  Patty.  I am so not familiar with when to come in. 
[02:47:30]  They don't follow the rules.  Don't worry about that.  The rules.  The rules.  What are the rules?  The rules are there.  You're like a four, four, beat.  Go nowhere.  Fuck no one.  Those are the rules.  Those are the rules.  This is a very difficult song to sing unless you're hearing the lyrics while you're singing  it or seeing it come up on the TV.  You made it yours, baby.  You made it yours.  Yeah, you did.  You made it your own.  Should we do a little limelight later to close out the show?  I thought that was good, dog.  Go practice limelight.  A little pinchy in the middle.  A little pinchy in the middle.  Absolutely dreadful. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  All right.  She, I don't know.  Yeah, she took a whack at her.  I thought she did great.  She got brave.  She's brave.  All right, we got Big A and Twitch.  Let's do a little news for us.  Ah, Big E.  I have to.  We're going in a couple minutes.  Me and Jeff, we have to leave.  What?  We have our, uh.  But it's our big Friday show.  Our 930.  I get picked up at 930.  What?  Oh.  And they, uh.  You're leaving too, Jeff?  We're shooting together.  They're shooting.  We're shooting together.  They're shooting.  We can't be late.  It's the lingo. 
[02:48:30]  No, are you kidding me?  They probably want us to stay at 8 o'clock.  Oh.  What?  What happened?  Um, shooting.  They're all fans, by the way, of the show.  Really?  That's wonderful.  Why don't we get our little bone?  They actually want you.  They said they don't want to call them back.  And I don't ask for a lot.  I just want to walk in the back of a fucking scene.  I'm not even asking to, like, to have lines.  They're very strict on who walks in the back of the scene for some reason.  I just want to sit there and drink coffee or something.  It's never anyone's pals.  I'll talk to them if you want.  Yeah, talk to them.  It's never people's pals.  Throw me a little bone.  Unless you're Kevin Smith.  Enough with the pal thing. 
[02:49:00]  When does this pal thing pay off?  Yeah.  You have a good life, man.  I'm not going to listen to you guys complain anymore.  Oh, really?  You're switching studios, and I respect that.  You guys have dedicated your lives four, five, six hours of radio a day.  It doesn't matter where you do it.  Your fans are so loyal.  Anytime I plug anything on this show, tons of people show up and go, I heard you on L&A.  That's just two listeners.  It doesn't matter if you're in the back of a fucking bus.  It doesn't matter if you're in the back of a bus.  It doesn't matter if you're in this beautiful studio. 
[02:49:30]  It's all about you guys.  Jimmy's getting undressed as you're talking.  Why are you getting undressed?  He's just changing.  He's putting pants on.  You're changing into your TV clothes, Jimmy?  My jeans, yeah.  Those are nice.  Now he's an actor.  Now, yeah.  An actor?  You're in wardrobe now.  Yeah!  Your hands are moving in actor fashion.  I don't even know what our scene is, really.  We're playing ourselves?  That's boring.  Well, no, I'd rather play myself. 
[02:50:00]  It's improv, mostly.  Can't we use fake names and wear funny clothes and do the same thing?  Yeah, we could do that.  My name is Bill Kinderman in this show.  Yes.  What's yours, Jeffrey Ross?  He was the fucking cop from The Exorcist.  Oh, shit.  Okay, Jimmy, obscure reference.  I'm going to go with the Bruce Springsteen guy.  What's his real name?  Bobo.  Bobo.  I'm going to be Bobo on the show.  You know, Bobo.  Hey, Bobo.  Good evening.  Bobo, two Jersey guys leaving to do some TV on this show called what?  Z-Rock, Jimmy? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, it's on the IFC.  So you've got two guys, stand-up comics.  They're leaving to do Z-Rock TV.  What do you got, Bobo?  Well, by the way, I didn't know there was a girl in studio.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know you were in here.  I didn't realize.  That was my underpants.  Your underpants.  Creepy.  If you knew, you would have taken his underwear off.  Oh, Pat, I'll be back.  Let's talk.  That's a girl.  I thought it was one of the Allman brothers.  That's not nice.  They're in town.  Oh, okay.  It's topical.  But you know what I'm saying, fellas. 
[02:51:00]  I sense a little bit of a morale sort of thing going on here with you guys with the studio change and the boxes.  We'll be all right.  Moving is always stressful, you know.  It is.  Change is good, especially for you guys, because you adapt in funny ways.  So as a listener and a fan, I'm not afraid of it.  See, you just don't know.  The inconvenience for you is for the fans.  It's going to be fun to hear you.  You don't know what we're walking into, though.  Do you live in a nice neighborhood, Jeffrey Ross?  Yeah.  Okay, now pack your bags and move uptown. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  Would you want to do that?  No, but if my friends were all coming with me, I'd be okay with it.  But where you're hated.  Yeah.  You're not going to be hated.  You're going to be beloved.  You wouldn't be going there.  No.  They fired everybody but you guys.  The only reason we're going there is because they don't want to pay rent on this.  Yeah.  Oh, am I still green?  Yeah, you're still green.  Management don't give a fuck about anything but many of the company good.  Red.  Red.  I'm saying good things.  Black man didn't land on Plymouth Rock. 
[02:52:00]  I'm saying good things.  Management don't give a fuck about nothing but being good.  Oh.  Wow.  Jimmy will probably be the one that gets like a talking to.  It's like, what are you saying?  Heard you raising your voice about management.  Jimbo, look at your demo reel playing.  What?  That'd be me if I had a fucking man's fucking faceline.  Faceline.  Good one.  God almighty.  I am a no-improving fucking shitty. 
[02:52:30]  My point is, family goes through ups and downs, and this is a tough time.  We'll be all right.  Trust me.  We're waiting for the first sign that they actually like us.  It's only been eight or nine months, so we're waiting.  It's stressful.  Management can suck my fucking dick if that's what they want to do.  If they don't, then they don't have to.  My dick belongs to them.  All right.  Wow, here's a real keeper.  Woman arrested after sending obscene video to friend. 
[02:53:00]  Sarasota, Florida.  Deputies have arrested a woman who videotaped herself having sex with two dogs.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Was it rough sex?  Oh, that's not bad.  I like that.  Rough sex.  Deputies say Carolyn Roulette videotaped herself having sex with two dogs and watching child pornography with a friend.  What friends does she have that she's like, oh, oh, Beatrice will love this.  Baby fucking while the Great Dane sticks his dick in my mouth. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, they'll get such a kick out of this on the YouTube.  I love how she...  The YouTube.  I love how she had to pump it up by also watching child porn.  Yeah.  It wasn't bad enough that she's having sex with dogs.  Wow.  You know what this video needs?  Me watching child porn as well.  What's her fucking website?  Everythingwrong.com?  What's the picture of, Rope?  You got a picture of that?  Yeah.  Is that a mugshot?  She's awful.  Oh.  That was one of the dogs.  One of the victims.  Yeah.  I wasn't sure if it was a dog. 
[02:54:00]  It sounds like a murderer in the game of Clue.  Ah, okay.  Two dogs fucking with child porn playing and a banana hat.  Go.  53-year-old.  We should get her for the big O&A variety show happening next Friday.  Oh, wow.  Imagine watching that.  My God.  53-year-old gave a CD with the images to an acquaintance.  Got to know who to give this shit to.  What's wrong with you?  She got her own CD.  Who turned it over to police.  Willett is in jail and is charged with three counts of possessing child porn. 
[02:54:30]  How do you not know that the person, how do you, like, shouldn't you be sure before  you hand over a video of yourself?  Positive you should be.  It's watching kiddie porn and fucking dogs.  Shouldn't you really know that's what they want?  What is this?  You'll like it.  Trust me.  Yeah.  Your vacation video shouldn't have been the last one they watched.  And then you just go, here's another.  By the way, the dog didn't sign a release.  I'm really sorry.  You're on this.  Anyway.  Have a good weekend, guys.  Wait, I'm dying.  I got one more line to the story, Jimmy.  I'm sorry, sweetie.  Willett admitted to detectives that she had sex with the animals in her home and watched 
[02:55:00]  young girls perform sex acts on the internet.  Jeez.  There you go.  Again, on that invisible internet.  On that invisible internet.  Yeah.  He was watching it off the invisible internet.  We're trying to find the invisible internet, Jeffrey.  It's out there.  The legal.  Jimmy, break a leg.  They stand out of the business.  I don't mean literally.  Don't hurt yourself.  I would hate that.  All right, Jimmy.  Can you do a sitcom out for everybody?  Sitcom out, everybody.  Wait, I got to have a line to walk out on.  Yeah, sitcom out. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, right, right.  Big line.  What could be a good sitcom line?  What do you need?  I don't know.  What's a good walk-off line?  Jimmy, are you excited for the big variety show next week?  If I was any more excited, I'd be fucking a dog and watching a tinder fuck.  Hey, there you go.  Sitcom out.  Sitcom out.  And as.  He's the end to as.  Ross, you want to do a sitcom out for everybody?  All right.  Stress Factory, Jeffrey Ross, all weekend long.  Go see him.  Yes.  Tickets pretty much sold out for tomorrow, so come see me Friday night. 
[02:56:00]  Call Vinny immediately and get your tickets.  And I'm going to be roasting members of the audience, so I'll have a podium on stage this  time, so bring your ugliest friend.  Wow, that's going to be disturbing for the people there.  Opie, that would be Anthony for you.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  Oh, wow.  What?  That was supposed to be my sitcom out, but.  Oh, my goodness.  That was my sitcom out.  Boy.  Shitcom.  I hope you enjoyed your last appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  I hope you guys enjoyed your last appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you, Jeffrey Ross.  All right. 
[02:56:30]  It would have been great if I left the headphones on in trip.  Yeah, that was.  Yeah, I should try to walk out with the studio.  You guys, thanks for having me on, and congratulations on the new change.  Yes.  All right.  There you go.  I'm the only one clapping.  Yeah.  There he goes.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jeffrey Ross.  Good to be there.  A little roast master.  Pat, you ready to do Let's Make a Deal?  It's very insulting, Jeffrey.  No, but I'll do it anyway.  Hey.  Big Ace here.  We're going to do a little more Let's Make a Deal.  If you're just tuning in, we are leaving. 
[02:57:00]  Next Friday is the last time you can see the show live for a while until hopefully we figure  out something new at the other joint.  Yeah.  So we're giving away everything in our office just about, because it's crap that's been  building up there for, I guess, four years.  Some of it literal crap.  Yeah.  It's this mouse shit.  Yeah.  Everything must go.  Yeah.  Just step all over me.  I don't care, Pat.  Yeah.  So if you're coming by the show next week, you've got a chance to actually go home with  some of the stuff from our office.  Yeah.  And we'll give some of that stuff away next. 
[02:57:30]  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  We've got a lot going on here at the Opie and Anthony show.  We're about to play Let's Make a Deal, but we're a little distracted because something  seems to be burning.  We smell smoke.  For real.  For real.  Yeah.  We started smelling smoke.  We don't see any smoke.  What?  What?  All right.  All right.  What is that? 
[02:58:00]  We don't see any, but there's just like a burning, like cardboardy burning kind of smell.  Sort of a little plastic thrown in, right?  Doesn't smell electrical.  But it doesn't smell electrical.  Like electrical fire is a very distinctive smell.  Yeah.  With the rubber insulation on the wire.  This is kind of cardboardy.  It's almost like a regular, your standard trash can type fire.  Yeah.  But the trash can's fine, and no one's been throwing any matches in there.  I don't smell it as much right now.  No, no.  It kind of was a puff. 
[02:58:30]  We might be all right.  A little puff and run.  Don't worry.  We'll get all the listeners out if we have to.  Oh, yeah.  Right after Anthony leaves first.  I'll just stand to my ass out of this fucking building in a second.  I will run, and hopefully the newspaper headlines will read, Opie and Anthony escape with their  lives, leave behind staff, and 30 or 40 listeners to die.  Oh, wonderful.  In fire.  That'll be, hey, publicity.  Any publicity, right?  Wow.  Eastside Dave might be given.  When he pushes over the woman in the walker. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  We're just watching the Seinfeld episode.  Just amazing.  He's in the ambulance.  The Austin.  Just amazing.  And Jon Favreau is the clown in that?  Is he?  Did Bob Kelly confirm that with a Twitter?  He might have to tweet him and ask him.  Can he tweet him?  Another question that Jon will never answer, Bobby.  I just got a text from Eastside Dave, Anthony.  I did put out the 111.  And can you read it?  Is it coherent?  Yes.  Because it's early. 
[02:59:30]  I'll get Leota, ASAP, signed, Dave, the Celebrity Murderer.  Murderer?  Jesus.  You never threw that.  Tit for tat.  We do have Eastside Dave on the phone.  He did say something, but I don't think murder is that.  Eastside Dave.  I'm on the commuter bus, so I can't talk loudly.  But I will say this.  Ray Leota, you're a fucking dead man.  I can't say that.  The restraining order, I believe, is in your future.  And if you know what's best for you, Ray Leota, you'll go run and hide. 
[03:00:00]  Be on the lam, so to speak, as you mafiosa put it.  I'm not afraid.  You're a fucking dead man.  What are you looking at, ma'am?  You fucking pay attention to People magazine.  Oh, well.  People are busybodies.  I am not only a celebrity murderer.  I'll kill everyone on this spot.  Okay.  You know damn well he's doing this for real, my life.  This is how I do it.  Yes, Dave.  Yes, Dave.  Yes, Dave.  It's Johnny Roast Beef.  Yeah.  If anyone else, if Maury from Maury's Wigs try to fuck with you, you let me know. 
[03:00:30]  I'll take out the whole fucking cast of Goodfellas.  I'll move on to the fucking casino.  You hear me, Sharon Stone?  You're next on my celebrity murder list.  Hey, I'm sick of People magazine.  Oh, look at me.  I'm sorry.  My commuter bus is filled with busybody people.  Yeah.  Dave, very good news.  You're going to be part of the big O&A variety show next Friday.  Fantastic.  What does this entail now?  Well, you're going to be riding a unicycle for everybody. 
[03:01:00]  Great.  Can I kill people, though?  Especially celebrities?  No, you can't kill anybody, because I like doing radio.  Yeah.  I think Dave is doing a little radio for everybody today.  Jesus, David.  Radio, Opie?  But, Dave, you're doing the unicycle thing next week.  Have you ever ridden a unicycle before?  Oh, I haven't tried, but I'd love to right now.  Well, next Friday.  You're riding the unicycle as part of the O&A variety show. 
[03:01:30]  Did I explain?  I'm on a commuter bus.  I can't hear so well, and people are staring.  But I'd love to do a unicycle.  It sounds great.  Well, you know, it's the last day before we move over to the big building, so we're doing  a huge O&A variety show next Friday.  I am here.  And you're going to be doing the unicycle thing, all right?  Okay.  And by the way, this isn't radio.  You're dead, Leona.  You're fucking dead.  This is like a...  Oh, how many hands up? 
[03:02:00]  What, Pat?  Why is there an aerial shot of a commuter bus on the news?  Pat, are you ready to play Let's Make a Deal?  We're giving away stuff from our office.  What are we giving away this time?  You guys got it all set up?  Wow, I'm sure it's going to be...  We're giving away an Alien Ant Farm skate snowboard.  Wow, that's going to be a good one.  Larry the Cable Guy DVD.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Skateboard without the wheels.  Yeah.  Okay.  Skateboard with diabetes.  And that Don Wicklin virus work shirt thing. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, right, right.  Especially good if your name's Jimmy, because...  It's Jimmy.  Yeah, but that's Jim Norton's.  Oh, and some Wow stickers.  We threw in some of those.  Wow.  You can't get those.  Sam, can we pump it up a little bit?  Because this might be the last giveaway for today.  Oh, man, if this is the last giveaway today, we're also giving away this beautiful needlepoint  of a beautiful woman.  She's laying nude. 
[03:03:00]  This has been in the phone screening room of the Opie and Anthony show, and there's  a Wow sticker on it that was touched by Opie.  It's uncensored if you turn it around.  That is horrible.  So bad.  It's needlepoint, isn't it?  Yes, it is needlepoint.  You know how long that took?  It's beautiful.  A really long time is the answer.  Who did it?  Yeah, who did it?  Do we even know where that came from?  Yes, Danny.  Believe it or not, Bruce Berenson brought it over. 
[03:03:30]  I don't know where he found it.  I don't know where it came from, but he brought it over, and he said, I think you guys would  like this.  Was he serious?  He thought wrong.  I think he was serious.  I like Bruce.  Yes, Derek.  His wife did it.  His wife did it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  That is his wife.  Derek, for real?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We can't trash Bruce's wife.  No, no.  We can trash that, though.  You don't like it, Ann?  No.  She's proportioned all fucked up.  It looks like her arms are twisted.  Well, I'm sure she...  Look at her ass.  It's not even making an indent on the bed, or the ass itself isn't being, reacting with 
[03:04:00]  what she's laying on.  It's horrible.  Is that shadowing, too, in the needlepoint?  Yeah, or is that shadowing?  That is shadowing.  Okay.  Done by needlepoint.  I got you, Sam.  We got it about the needlepoint.  Thanks.  It's like early 1900s porno.  Just leave it.  Let it sit.  Soak that in, people.  That's called a bomb.  You just got cropped up.  That is called...  Yeah.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, wow.  You can see it up on the back, too.  Yeah, that's what Pat said.  It's uncensored if you turn around.  Oh, okay.  If you turn around.  I wasn't listening to Pat the whole show.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  We ready for Let's Make a Deal?  Everyone knows their parts.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, by the way, we added a little something else here.  We got two boxes in the studio.  Box one and box two.  What's in the box?  So whoever wins this could decide to trade in for what's behind these boxes, Ann.  Yes.  We've added a whole new twist to the game.  We sure did.  We sure did.  A whole new old twist. 
[03:05:00]  Right.  All right.  Well, how do we start out?  We got the announcement again by Big A.  Everyone knows their parts?  Oh, yeah.  Pat, you got to welcome everyone back when it's your turn.  Work the crowd a little bit.  Back to Big A.  Big A explains the prizes.  And then, Pat, you take it away with the item you're looking for from the audience.  Yeah, this is almost like you're coming back from a commercial.  I've made a list of items, so I didn't have to think of them off the top of my head.  That's good.  Oh, very good.  All right.  Are we ready for the game show music?  I think we are.  Oh, yeah.  Let her rip. 
[03:05:30]  Welcome back to Let's Make a Deal with our host, Pat Kamenaki.  Hey, everybody.  Welcome to Let's Make a Deal.  Oh, we're going to have a great show today.  We're going to have a chance to win some prizes.  But I'm not just going to give it to you.  You're going to have to make a deal for it.  Big A, tell them what we could win today.  They could win an alien and farm tape board without the wheels. 
[03:06:00]  And a Larry Cable Guy DVD.  And the needle point of a naked dick with a wow, I was touched by Opie.  A wow what?

[03:07:00]  Oh, wow.  That's slammering.  All right.  I'm going to ask for a few items.  And if you have them, you could win the items.  Or maybe you could have a chance at what's in either box one or box two.  What's in the box?  Or your mom's box if you lose.  Okay.  First on my list, who's got a PBA card?  Oh, a police man's benevolent association card.  Nothing?  I think I see someone reaching. 
[03:07:30]  I see someone reaching for that line.  Pay attention.  All right.  Let's see.  Is it current?  That's been yelled at.  Better be current.  Not current.  You didn't say current.  Well, Pat's making the rules.  What kind of details does he want?  Yeah.  It's got to have a...  Oh, nice.  Is that 2006?  Sorry.  Needs to be current.  Why does it need to be current?  What are you, a cop?  He wasn't just pulled over.  Don't we have a unique item that we can be looking for? 
[03:08:00]  I'm looking.  I'm looking for...  You're told.  A store...  A store credit card.  Like, from a Best Buy or a Circuit City.  Might not want to use those these days.  Anymore and in these days.  He mixed it up.  Come on.  Who?  Who?  Who?  Anybody have it?  I see somebody looking nervously.  No, I don't need a bobby pin, sir.  Who the hell are you using bobby pins?  You got a buzz cut.  What the hell? 
[03:08:30]  And somebody's fumbling to the wallet.  I ain't got no hair pin.  Nothing?  Oh, he's fumbling.  He's wasting my time.  Okay.  Somebody else pulling a wallet out.  Mixed on the list.  Yeah.  Hmm, who has, uh, not me, a $50 bill?  A $50 bill?  A $50 bill?  That's a tough one.  That's a tough one.  How's I get it out of here?  Anyone, anyone.  You have to check?

All right, we have a winner here on Let's Make a Deal.  What's her name?  All right, big A, tell her what she's, what are you? 
[03:09:30]  What am I doing?  You can't.  Ah, hello, what's your name, young lady?  Elise.  Hi, Elise.  Would you like this lovely prize package we have, or what's in box one or box two?  Hmm, hmm, yeah.  No, I'm just going to take what's there.  All right!  Thank you, Lisa.  One-time popular belay.  For a very boring, uh, choice.  Well, the crowd not happy.  What did, uh, what did she win, Pat?  You got to go back to big A. 
[03:10:00]  Big A, tell her what she's won, even though you said it two minutes ago.  It's like the 12 days of Christmas.  About the wheels.  About the wheels.  About the wheels.  Um, the little point.  Um, she wants to renege, ding, ding, on the prize.  Oh, really?  Yes, you'd like one of the boxes?  Yeah, well, okay.  What one?  Uh, box, uh... 
[03:10:30]  Box, what are you...  From the Boston area!  We're from Boston, can you tell?  Wait, wait, wait.  You gotta...  Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.  And thanks for dressing up for the show, sir.  Pat!  This sucks, though, I will...  Hey, Pat!  Pat!  You got to kind of talk it up like,  Oh, she's going for the box!  Get the audience psyched out.  Yay, everybody!  She's going for the box!  Yay!  Woo!  And now the audience has to yell out there,  suggest it.  What do they think that she should go for?  Two!  Huh, which one, which one?  Two!  Two!  One!  One!  Two!  Three! 
[03:11:00]  All right.  Box number two!  Box, she chose box number two!  Carol Madel, show her what she's won!  Oh, wow!  Big A, show her what she's won!  Big A, why don't you tell her what she's won?  And she has won a lovely jack-off soap.  She won the jack-off soap we were talking about last weekend. 
[03:11:30]  Yes, it's a hand in the shape of the jacking-off position.  And it's made of soap on a rope.  Yeah, so that's what she won.  She traded in some fine prizes for that there.  There's your hand-job soap.  Wow.  Boy, you should have stayed where you were and not picked the box, huh?  All right, everybody, thanks for playing.  Let's make a deal!  Let's hear it for our big winner, Lisa!  Fantastic.  Are we supposed to reveal what was in box one that she didn't win?  Yes, we actually are. 
[03:12:00]  Unless we want to, uh, yeah, okay.  Show Lisa what she would have won.  What she would have won if she had picked the first box.  What we have here is a copy of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories  signed by Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the entire O&A staff.  Wow!  And Laszlo.  And Laszlo.  Everybody that's in the game.  Are you still happy with your choice, Lisa?  No!  Oh!  Well, too fucking bad, that's it.  Thanks!  Wow, you got fucked over. 
[03:12:30]  Enjoy your jack-off soap.  Yeah.  Until it wears down, then you have to get a bigger cock, I guess.  What if I show you more of my rock?  No, it's too late now.  All right, well.  Oh, wow, that was something.  Yeah.  I don't know what.  They should make that soap out of lava.  Ooh, ouch.  You mean lava soap.  Well, they should make that soap out of lava soap.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because made out of lava, the first thing you're thinking is,  why would you make it out of molten rock? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, ouch.  Yeah.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes,  Big A washes with a murdered baby on a rope.  So...  Oh, wow.  That's no Kevin from Connecticut.  Ouch.  Oh, damn.  Whoa, whoa.  Hey.  Come on, Steve.  From Bayshore.  How was it?  Everything.  All right, are we doing, um...  We should get Twitchell's and Big A in here?  Ah, yes. 
[03:13:30]  Lewis Twitchell's Santani.  We haven't done Big A and Twitchell's News in a while.  We haven't seen Lewis Twitchell's Santani in quite some time.  No, I hear Twitchell's is doing some stuff in the city.  I hear Twitchell's is a traitor.  He is a traitor.  Absolutely.  That's what I'm hearing.  We're going to give him the full metal jacket beating after his appearance on the show  today.  Uh, Twitchell's.  Over here, Twitchell's.  Good.  Twitchell's is doing a bunch of stuff in the city, and I hear that you're staying with 
[03:14:00]  Colin Quinn.  So you don't have to commute.  What?  Well, first of all, hi, guys.  What the hell?  How you doing, man?  Hey, Twitchell's.  Hey.  Yeah, thanks to Colin, I didn't have to commute back to Philly.  I stayed at his apartment last night.  Did you fuck him?  Not that lucky, no.  Wow, you're, uh, you're bucking today, huh?  Just a little bit.  I had three cups of coffee while watching Let's Make a Deal.  You look very thin.  What's going on with you? 
[03:14:30]  Uh, I just, I lost weight.  Ninja?  Lost weight from all that shaking?  What's...  No, you know, just, uh...  Robert Reed diet?  Didn't want to get, didn't want to, uh...  Jump.  Stay at 220, and didn't want to, uh, get back up to 300.  Cut out soda.  Jump!  Jump!  Oh, yeah.  Just trying to hold it in.  Jump.  He is having a lot of trouble.  The, the, what's the girl, the, not the, not the, not the pregnant one, the other one, 
[03:15:00]  I forget her name already.  She's really sweet.  She came, she's like, I've been keeping track of your coffee, but I lost track of a second  ago.  What, what is he doing?  Fascinating.  She asked me how many I had, I think, I think I've had like four now.  Four cups of coffee?  Yeah.  Oh, you can't ask me to be here at 7.30.  Tyra's got some hotties on her show today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, thanks.  He's insane.  Who do?  It's little girls. 
[03:15:30]  What?  Dressed as princesses.  Oh, I didn't know.  Princesses.  They have fake teeth in.  Yeah.  I didn't see their baby teeth.  Tyra's making them take out their fake teeth.  Their adventures.  So they could be more exploited.  What are these, little beauty queens?  Yeah.  Tyra's handing out, Tyra's handing out like what?  I don't know.  Ew.  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  They got that beauty queen show on, what channel?  I think it's TLC.  TLC.  One of those things where they show, and it's just despicable. 
[03:16:00]  Absolutely.  And now I guess they're showing.  Look what they make little kids do.  They go, yeah, shake your ass, kid.  That's what you want in front of a crowd of people.  And the guys, all the guys that are involved in these little pageants are homos.  They're all homos.  Homosexuals.  But they're like, not the fun kind of people you want living next to you homos.  You know.  There's nothing wrong with it.  The over-the-top ones.  The over-the-top ones you don't like.  Really creepy homos. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then the big fat moms.  They all have the big fat moms.  Yeah.  They're all hugely fat moms who are living vicariously through their abused little children.  Speaking of.  All right.  Twitchels.  Abused little children.  And Big A.  We haven't done this in a while.  You know, we're getting the band back together.  You guys are going to do some news for everybody?  Because we're kind of screwing off today.  And we certainly want to sound like we're current.  Oh, my God.  You know, when they stand next to each other like that, they look like the number's shit. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, boy.  I have a little bit on that one.  All right.  Are we ready for Big A and Twitchels news?  I'm Big E.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys can face the crowd.  You don't have to face us.  I mean, you've got to entertain them.  You've got a great crowd out there.  A lot of people.  Yeah.  Oh, Twitchels.  What?  A bunch of people found out that you were coming today.  And they came to me as I was walking through to go to the bathroom.  And it was asked to me by a few different listeners.  They were hoping you were going to do your Cowardly Lion today. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  People love the Cowardly Lion.  Can you warm up the crowd before the news with your Cowardly Lion?  Oh, darling.  I don't think we're in arms anymore.  I think we're in XM.  I thought about it.  Look at these people.  I'm so sorry.  You're leaving this beautiful studio, Owen.  It's such a crime.  Holy Jesus. 
[03:18:00]  I can't tell you the times that has come up in my memory.  Yeah.  And I can never remember it as horrific as it actually is.  Yeah.  Can you try that again?  Because I think you're a little nervous or something.  You've done it way better.  Yeah.  It didn't really sound like the Cowardly Lion.  You guys want to hear the Cowardly Lion again?  It didn't really sound like him as much.  Yeah.  Not as much. 
[03:18:30]  So focus here and really give it your all there, Twitchels.  Here we go.  Why'd you hit me?  I'm in a fight.  But you tried.  I'm so upset.  I thought that you're such a cunt.  I'll put him up.  I'll put him up.  You fat fuck.  I'll put him up.  I'll put you up.  I'll put you up.  I'll put you up.  That curse never equals funny.  Behind my back. 
[03:19:00]  There you go.  I'm sorry, guys.  I mean, this is definitely nostalgic.  Am I right?  It's very nostalgic.  And I'm standing in the studio right now, and you've got a crowded fucking room.  And just listening to the show for two and a half hours, it brings back memories.  It's been a year and a half since I've been here.  Really?  That long?  Yeah.  Who fucking knew? 
[03:19:30]  But anyway, it's definitely a pleasure, and it just shows how much you guys have done,  because this room's packed, and I think you guys should give yourself a hand, because  you're devoted fucking fans.  Don't go for the...  No, I'm damn dead serious.  Joey Bishop?  I'm trying to help you.  I'm trying to lift your spirits, guys.  Our spirits are fine.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Give out.  No.  You still do the jump thing, right?  I bet you a lot of these guys don't even know the jump thing, because it's been a long 
[03:20:00]  time.  You guys know that if you yell jump, you will jump, right?  Yeah.  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Yeah, he kind of has to.  Oh, shit.  He just pushed the mic all the way down on the stand, and almost fell down.  He just banged his head on the mic.  Ah!  That's going to let him how he just...  Christ!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump! 
[03:20:30]  Jump!  Jump!  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.  Wow.  This is cruel.  What have you guys been doing while I've been gone?  All right, you all right?  Pick up your mind.  Jump, switch, jump.  That's a loaded question.  You all right?  Wow, that's kind of hard.  Tighten these.  You're exhausting.  His life is exhausting.  I got to bed at 5 a.m.  That whiplash thing.  I got an hour later to come here, and that's nothing compared to what you guys do. 
[03:21:00]  You do this all the time.  Give us a hand.  No, give him a hand.  I'll put him in the house.  Anyway, it's great to be here.  All right.  All right.  Put your headphones on.  Sorry for the nerves.  I'm trying to.  You're blowing snot rockets.  I know.  He's really losing his fucking composure.  Hey, Twitches, I thought you smoked a pot to mill your shit out.  And you know what?  I'm out.  I'm re-upping today, actually.  But I found like in the past year or so, I'm able to control it a little bit more. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, it looks it.  But I've built up such a tolerance.  Look, in all seriousness, I smoke the very best.  I don't like to smoke anything else.  I don't smoke midis.  I smoke the best hydro.  About a quarter a day.  And when you smoke a quarter ounce a day, seven grams, it's about roughly about two ounces  or so a week.  You build a high endurance.  And sometimes it's not as effective to calm the tics because I'm so used to it. 
[03:22:00]  And when I think about it so much, it just brings it out more.  It really, really, really does.  He's sweating.  What's up with you, man?  Are you nervous to be here because it's been a while?  Yeah, I'll be quite honest.  I am.  All right.  I'm a little nervous to be here.  I really, that was more like the line that hit me try. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, fuck.  Well, you guys called me and you asked me to come here.  So you obviously wanted me here.  Are you happy to see me?  Well, we're.  Oh, of course.  We're going to try something today, too.  We're going to.  Our show is ending in about another half hour or so.  And then we're going to do another installment of the David and Bobo show.  But today, it's David and Bobo meets Twitchells and Big A.  Yes.  Really?  It's like when the Jetsons met the Flintstones. 
[03:23:00]  You know how they put the.  This is Bobo, right?  That's Bobo.  Awesome.  Best Bruce Spring special.  Isn't it great?  Oh, wait.  Bobo.  I believe Twitchells is from Jersey, right?  Oh, he is.  Twitchells.  He's got a shaking problem.  He's got turrets.  If you sing, jump.  He will jump.  And he's from Jersey.  I think he got so nervous, he crashed on the turnpike. 
[03:23:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Sing about the turnpike.  Oh, he likes that turnpike.  He certainly does.  Well, don't fucking God I don't drive.  Bobo, where are you from in Jersey?  I'm from Queens.  I'm from Queens, New York, but I just do the whole Bobo Springsteen bit.  Oh, okay.  You're not a guy doing a bad Springsteen press.  He's not really from Jersey.  He's like, yeah, but I do the whole Bobo Springsteen bit. 
[03:24:00]  The Bobo Springsteen bit.  Whoa, whoa.  Right.  Jesus.  And then he goes on the turnpike.  Whoa.  And not to leave out Big A, of course.  Big A, how have you been?  All right.  Not bad.  Yeah.  Not bad.  Yeah.  We're treating you nice on the show today, see?  We're learning from Ron and Fez.  It's not bad to be nice every once in a while, right?  You're welcome.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I don't know why your mic's not on.  Let me see what you're doing.  He's just not close enough to it.  Oh, all right. 
[03:24:30]  Try it again there.  There you go.  We got it.  I think he's still trying to swallow that trout that's stuck in his gullet.  Hey, Twitch, was there any new impressions?  Anything new going on with you?  Well, we've got a lot of stuff going on.  And don't you dare promote that other fucking channel on our show.  What do you mean?  Is that why you're calling me?  If you're going to call me a traitor, then why not?  I'm not calling a traitor.  Why are we a traitor when XM and Sirius are both combined?  I'm on Miserable Men. 
[03:25:00]  Big deal.  Now you're sounding like me.  You're grunting.  What's the problem?  You've got a room full of people to fucking support you, and not to mention all the listeners,  and you're making a big deal out of it.  Why can't we...  What is he talking about?  Why can't we just be a fucking happy family?  I mean, we already kind of are.  You only see me once every two years.  So yes, you ask me if I'm nervous when I come in and I hear you guys saying, 
[03:25:30]  he's a traitor, he's a traitor, he's a traitor.  I'm looking around for that paddle.  It brings back memories.  Ah, right.  I do remember the paddle.  And that ain't going to happen again.  Never.  What did we do with the paddle?  I worked with Bob Levy and a couple other guys.  What did we do with the paddle?  Because I did that, you spanked me.  But first, I don't want you all fairness.  You did make it fair.  You gave me a chance to get out of it by playing a game of Jenga.  Isn't that nice of them?  They made it really fucking fair. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  I, of course, lost to...  God, what's his name?  Me.  Michael J. Fox?  Who?  Danny.  Oh, Jesus.  Danny!  Oh, fuck.  I'm going to kick your ass.  I'm sorry, man.  Everybody looks different.  Sam's got the crazy...  What's his name?  All right.  Simpson's hair.  Psychobomb.  I wish you would have hit him.  I don't even know.  Everyone looks different.  It's good to see you.  Ah!  All right.  All right.  This is not all about Lewis Twitchelson 10.  It's certainly not.  The one we do...  Whose website, by the way, completely exposes you. 
[03:26:30]  Just a big A in the ball.  Just a big A in the nuts.  He can't fucking hit a guy with Tourette's.  Yeah.  Well, that would be harder.  It would be...  Yeah, thank you, Anthony.  It's not like...  It's like...  The joke would be, you can't hit Christopher Reeve.  All right.  Well, it would have been when he was still alive.  Right.  Now it's kind of hard to hit him.  Yeah.  Because he's underground.  All right.  Why don't we do the news for Big A in Twitchels?  Ah.  Very good.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:27:00]  Well, there's a ticker.  I like it.  Here we go.  I mean, Twitchels.  All right.  Good morning, everyone.  It's time for news.  Us.  Us.  Corvies.  I'm Big A.  And I'm Louis Twitchels Santani. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Today, we start with this...  This...  This...  This...  That's suddenly two months ago. 
[03:28:00]  All right.  She received, uh...  This...  Uh...  This...  Irving...  That, uh...  From the girls' high school saying...  I love that.  Mom.  Mom.  Mom.  She needs to improve her attendance... 
[03:28:30]  Or can't...  Or can't go to the prom.  The letter...  The letter...  The letter...  That Megan...  Jillian's...  Attendance was...  16.4%.  And the school...  Quires...  It's...  Uh... 
[03:29:00]  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  To keep a 90...  Um...  2% attendance...  Is it...  I get...  Oh, my God.  He's only up to there.  Uh...  Jillian...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh... 
[03:29:30]  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  I have no idea what that story was about. 
[03:30:00]  It's actually really funny.  Yeah, apparently.  A dead girl got a letter saying that her attendance needed to improve.  Oh, really?  Look, see, everyone's laughing because they have no idea what that story was about.  It's a much funnier translation on the island.  Danny will translate Big A after Big A reads his story.  Now, TLC has ordered a new docu-soap series called Cake Boss that follows baker Buddy Valistro.  Valistro. 
[03:30:30]  Valistro's elaborate confections for celebrity like Britney Spears have been featured on shows ranging from...  Ranging from Today, I guess the Today show, right?  That makes sense.  The Sopranos.  Oh, and the Sopranos.  The show will follow the New Jersey-based Valistro...  Where is it based?  That's correct for New Jersey. 
[03:31:00]  Just wondering.  Wait, hold on.  They just handed the mic to Bobo because there's a Jersey reference.  This show is based in Jersey, and the set is right where I took a dump.  Wah, wah, wah.  He's just calling him in now.  I love it.  Yeah.  Like Bobo said, the show will follow the New Jersey-based Valistro and his Italian family as they run Carlo's Bakery in Hoboken. 
[03:31:30]  TLC will air the show's pilot April 19th.  This business and practically have icing in...  I skipped like three lines.  Breathe.  Breathe.  Stop breathing.  TLC will air the show's pilot April 19th with the series launching in early June.

[03:41:30]  Lewis Twitchell, is that his name?  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Anyway, he's now spitting up candy and water.  Sam is holding another piece of candy.  You all right, there, Twitchells?  I got my mind.  What did he say?  What did he try to say?  He sounded like Cornholio.  I still got all in my mouth. 
[03:42:00]  I'm enjoying it.  I'm enjoying it.  All right.  Listen, stick around.  You're going to be doing the David and Bobo show.  David and Bobo meet Pig A and Twitchells after the break.  We're going to close up the show and get into the David and Bobo show after the break.  Yep.  Of course, we've got one more thing to do.  Patty's going to sing us out.  Some more rush?  Yeah, she's going to do Limelight, I believe it.  She's been practicing that for the last half hour.  We'll wrap up next and get into the David and Bobo show next.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, I want to thank the crowd for stopping by today. 
[03:42:30]  We greatly appreciate it.  Look, they're giving themselves a round of applause.  By the way, Sam, we've got good news.  The stuff we didn't give away in the Let's Make a Deal game today, we're handing out to the audience right now?  Yeah, of course.  I don't know if your mic's on.  Does it work?  Does it work?  It sort of works, yeah.  So if you and E-Rock could hand out the rest of the stuff that we have today.  Every day we're giving away stuff, and we're going to try to play some kind of Let's Make a Deal or something.  I don't know, maybe we'll change it up as the week goes on.  The last week, before we move over to the next phase of our careers. 
[03:43:00]  Yes, the other studio.  I call it the next phase.  Yeah.  We'll see if it's a good phase or a bad phase.  Maybe the angry phase.  Who knows?  We'll keep an open mind.  All right, start hearing that shit out.  Announce what you got, and get out.  We got a wow shirt.  Oh!  A YSP wow shirt, anybody.  It's a collector's item.  We're not on that station. 
[03:43:30]  All right.  You win this shirt.  Yay!  They didn't want that shirt, Sam.  All right, what's the next thing?  This is...  All the Jim Norton's...  This is Jim's wow virus shirt, and you're the first one to ask, so you get to be a member  of Team Virus.  Team Virus, thanks to Don Wicklin.  It was a nice idea, but no one wore the shirts except for Master Pop.  Matter of fact, I'm bringing mine in on Monday there, Sam.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, I'm not keeping that shirt.  Who likes Larry the Cable Guy? 
[03:44:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  You get...  You get...  Wow.  Deafening.  Deafening.  Fucking honesty of our listeners.  Sometimes I hate it.  And we have, from one of the hottest bands in America, Alien Ant Farm, the official Alien  Ant Farm skateboard with no wheels.  It's autographed.  There you go, sir.  All right.  Now we get into the big items.  Yeah, big items.  Big money items.  This is the needlepoint thing. 
[03:44:30]  We have the famous Naked Woman needlepoint with a wow sticker that Opie touched.  And that is going to our friend Carlton.  Yay!  Yay!  Hey, Sam.  Yeah?  Can you keep it fair?  Is there something Anthony touched that you could give away today?  Anthony, could you touch this Frank Sinatra picture real quick?  I'd love to.  Could you just touch this?  Put your cock.  Put your cock on it.  I'll touch right on the drink, because that's my favorite part.  There you go.  There we go. 
[03:45:00]  Make sure they know what part Anthony touched.  The drink.  Yes.  And now, the Frank Sinatra portrait that Anthony touched...  That's a biggie.  Wow.  That is a...  Is going to the girl who kicked Pat Duffy in the balls that time.  Wow.  That time.  Nice.  And finally, the last item of the day is the Grand Theft Auto, signed by Opie, Anthony,  the entire staff, and Laszlo.  You got jerk-off soap.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah?  Show Pat how Let's Make a Deal is done. 
[03:45:30]  You got a lot of people that want this thing, so let's do it for real here.  Okay.  Something they're going to have, and it comes down to quickness.  Who has a dime?  Me.  Well, you got to show Sam.  Yeah.  This guy showed me a dime.  Oh.  And he won.  Also, the guy that brought the cheesesteaks and the Philly pretzels.  Yep.  Who was outside at 5.15 in the morning, and Kenny made him wait with the heavy box until  seven.  Seven.  That's the rules. 
[03:46:00]  Hey, he's doing his job, man.  All right.  There you go.  Thanks for the food, bro.  Thank you.  We greatly appreciate it.  We'll have more stuff to give away all next week.  Oh, yeah.  All next week.  Erock, how much stuff we got in that office?  I mean, we start off slow.  We got a lot more than that.  Yeah, there's a lot more to go.  Plus, there's offices of two other programs in this building that will be up to you.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to go through the Ron and Fez office.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Definitely.  All right.  Make sure we have a lot of stuff on Monday.  We will.  We're really going to pump this up starting Monday.  Twitchels keeps pointing at me and whispering Sam because he wants to plug his gig. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  Go ahead, Twitchels.  Twitchels did a good job.  Thank you, guys.  We love him right here.  He did do good radio for us today.  I appreciate it, man.  Saturday, April 4th, I'll be at Club Pearl in Boston, Massachusetts, and also got a big  show in May at Friday, May 8th at the Scottish Rite Theater in Collinswood, New Jersey.  Nick DiPaolo, Bob Levy, me, and special guest Dave.  This is funny.  Dave the Hammer Schultz.  He's a former Philadelphia Flyers.  He's a legend.  So, actually, my site's in the works, but I'm touring with Colin and the guy, so for all 
[03:47:00]  the dates I'm on, go to RedBobLevy.com.  Ah, yeah.  All right, very good.  Thank you, Twitchels.  E-Rock and Butch and...  E-Rock it is.  Yeah, E-Rock's still handing stuff out that we didn't even talk about on the air, so...  Oh, he's still handing out goodies.  Yeah, so...  What are they?  Oh, various shirts.  Yeah.  Shitty shirts.  Shitty...  What?  Shitty, like, underwear that have our names on it.  Who knows?  All the hacked stuff that was made.  Next week is the final week to see the show live until we figure it out at the other joint. 
[03:47:30]  And let's not forget, next Friday is the O&A Variety Show to wrap up our time in this  fine facility.  So far, booked is Eastside Dave riding a unicycle.  He's never ridden a unicycle before, which is the beauty of the whole thing.  But he'll be very good at that.  Yes, I think so, too.  And Sam's working on his act and the interns, and it should be a good show next Friday.  Yeah.  The big variety show.  All right, Patty, you're going to sing us out before the David and Bobo show, huh?  Oh, this will be great.  Some more Rush, I guess, Limelight. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, we're keeping the channel live for a while, so David and Bobo are going to do  their thing.  And today, it's David and Bobo meets Big A and Twitchels.  Should be...  Wonderful.  Should be quite interesting.  All right.  You guys want to hear Patty sing us out with a little Rush?  No, I didn't think so, but we're going to do it anyway.  Patty, you've been practicing, right?  Yeah, I...  Does this song seem easier to sing?  You're having a tough time with the Tom Sawyer.  Yeah.  Because it wasn't following the rules. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, I guess.  I hope I remember how the tune goes through all this time.  You don't know Rush?  It's just that I don't really...  I was in the Beatles and into the Rolling Stones.  You were in the Beatles?  No, I was into the Beatles and Rolling Stones.  We didn't really need an answer.  No.  Jesus.  What are you going to learn, Patty?  You've only been with us since the beginning.  Yeah, but Rush was kind of after the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.  Well, not the Rolling Stones, but...  It's almost the 80s, I'd say, 80s. 
[03:49:00]  Well, Anthony, Stephen asked for Bayshore who's plugging my brother's restaurant.  I guess he's looking for free beer this weekend.  He'll be there all weekend long, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  I hit a 20 there yesterday, and someone found it.  I'm going Sunday.  Yeah.  You're going Sunday to FH Riley's?  Yeah, my friends Melissa and Drew and I, we want to go try out the pasta thing.  Oh, the pasta Sunday is a big hit in Huntington.  Big hit.  And we're going to go for it.  Get there early.  All right, Patty, Limelight, the stage is yours. 
[03:49:30]  Living on the lightest stage approaches the unreal.  Is that right, guys?  No.  No.  A lot of no's out there.  It's just, like, forgot.  Forgot what? 
[03:50:00]  Hey, would you just cue her into the first one?  I'll give her a try.  Yeah, I'll give her a good try.  All right.  Watch, Anthony, will you?  Wait for the intro, yeah.  Patty, I hear you sing on Ronna Fez.  You sing like an angel, which goes against what you look like.  I know the song.  I know the song.  But you've got that voice.  Yeah.  That Ronna Fez get out of you.  Why do we get the shit out of you?  I'm not familiar with hard rock.  Ronna Fez get the nice stuff out of you.  I only know some of the other songs that I like.  The hard rock.  Hard rock.  It's the most difficult. 
[03:50:30]  You have, like, a head.  This is barely above Casio.  How far is Rush?  I would have to be on YouTube for about two hours singing along before I really get the  song.  Man, we've got to file down her vocal cords or something.  Yeah, it's really.  The rushness of that voice.  Just snip one like a piano wire.  Here we go, Patty.  Come on.  Come on.  Watch Anthony.  Say it. 
[03:51:00]  I didn't signal out.  We told you that Anthony was going to give you the point.  I thought he did.  No, no, no.  I was like, ready?  I thought he did.  Ready?  And then I'll go and I'll throw something at your face.  No, don't.  All right.  Just point to me.  Patty, if you don't get it right this time, we have to cut your hair. 
[03:51:30]  It's only fair.  No.  No.  No.  All right, Patty.  Look at this.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Pull those golden locks over your shoulders so no one fucks with them.  Right.  Jesus.  I'm very slow to learn stuff like this.  I don't understand the music.  Like that?  Look at it.  She's covering her hair.  I know.  She's so paranoid.  Patty, I promise we're not cutting your hair today, all right?  Don't worry about it.  We've got to get a lush song out of you.  Yeah, concentrate on the song.  You're bleeding into the David and Bobo show.  Yeah.  And their time. 
[03:52:00]  Their stars.  Yes.  Here we go.  This is an art on it.  Watch Anthony.  For real.  He's going to give you the first cue and then you're on your own.  Mm-hmm.  Drums.  Wait for it to go around.  Wait for it to go around again.  One more time.  Living on the blinded stage approaches the unreal with those who think and feel in touch 
[03:52:30]  with some reality beyond the gilded cage.  Cast in this likely role ill-equipped to act.  With insufficient tact, one must put up barriers to keep oneself intact. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't understand the meaning of that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Those who wish to...  Where are you going?  That's the part.  Put aside the...  Wait, where are you going?  Those who wish to be...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my...  I don't understand the music. 
[03:53:30]  Is there anyone...  It's too hard.  It's too hard.  Is there anyone out there...  She'll never say that in any other context.  Is there anyone out there that could sing Rush right now for us, Limelight?  For real.  You want to do it, Abby?  No, he would do a better job.  I'm not familiar with this type of music, and I never learned the songs.  Wow, this is very unbelievable, Anthony.  The reigning guitar hero champion...  Holy shit.  The fireman.  What?  The fireman.  Evan Champion.  Ah, Evan Champion.  The fireman.  Okay. 
[03:54:00]  The fireman.  You know Rush?  Love Rush.  And can you fucking belt this shit out?  Sure.  All right.  Look at him.  He's like, sure.  He had confidence with the guitar hero.  Rush is not easy to sing.  Yeah.  Let's see if he has the confidence in the karaoke.  I've been doing my best, Eddie.  All right.  Ready?  And I want you to work this, my friend.  You know this song, right?  You don't need me to nod you in.  No.  Yeah.  I'm good.  Of course.  All right.  Here we go.  Let her up the fireman.  Fireman, everyone.  Fireman.  Fireman.  Fireman. 
[03:54:30]  Fireman.  Fireman.  Live in on a lighted stage, approaches to the unreal.  For those who think and feel  In touch with some reality 
[03:55:00]  Beyond the gilded cage  Casting this unlikely role  In love with two acts  Within sufficient acts  One must put up barriers  To keep oneself intact  Sam's rooting them on in  The thing and the limelight  The universe of dreams 
[03:55:30]  For those who wish to see  Those who wish to be  Must put aside the alienation  Get on with the fascination  The real relation  Beyond the life  Living in a fish island 
[03:56:00]  Caught in the camera's eye  I have no heart to lie  I can't pretend the stranger's  Long-awaited friend  This is no guitar hero, is it, my friend?  It's a hard song to sing them  And Sam's writing today  And Sam's on the world  And be the stage  And we are merely players  Performers and portrayers  Each and other 
[03:56:30]  Cheering them on  Outside the gilded cage  Look at Sam's rocking like  This is the best thing he's ever heard  Living in the limelight  The universe of dreams  For those who wish to see  Thanks  Those who wish to be  Must put aside the alienation  Get on with the fascination  The real relation  Beyond the life 
[03:57:00]  Here we go  How's he doing, Sam?  Thumbs up  What?  Rocking  Huh?  I thought there was nothing  He could do better than guitar hero  And I was proven wrong  Yeah  He's rocking  He's rocking, huh?  Your boy sucks at singing Rush  Wow  But then again 
[03:57:30]  I think Rush is really hard to sing  Very high  But doing it in falsetto like that  It's a little thin  Yeah  Sounding a little thin  We gotta shut up  He's getting ready to  Oh yeah  Finish this thing up  The big fucking finish  Yeah  The big limelight finish  Yeah  Back to you, Eddie  The fireman  That was the big part right there 
[03:58:00]  Yeah  It's hard without the lyrics  To cue  Well  Make it look easy  Was that it?  Yeah  It  Yeah  That's pretty much it  I'm bringing Husky Stash 
[03:58:30]  Up to the big leagues  As far as instant feedback goes  Oh really?  He's from Kentucky  You're gonna hear more from this kid  In the coming weeks  You moving him up?  You scouting him?  I just scouted him  We're moving him up to the bigs  He writes  Why does Evan sound like  The old guy from Family Guy?  Yeah  The old guy that hits on the little boys?  Yes  We all know  Evan  Evan  Evan  Evan  Oh wow  Sam just can't get enough in  We have a lot of people out there  We lost the crowd  That's his boy  That's his

[04:17:30]  Okay he's gone  Yeah  Do you guys got other listeners  Other than Dennis  Dennis likes to be rude  To me all the time  I don't know why the fuck  Would he ask if you're inbred  I don't know why he does that  You don't look it  No I'm definitely not inbred at all  No  Well I have  I have to say  I have to say one thing  That  That  Why do we need more publicity  From the madam  Right  I heard it already  You need to remind me more  Why I have to pay more taxes 
[04:18:00]  That's true  Because Bobo is upset  Because he thinks  That the whole  With the whole MTA fare increase  Governor Patterson  Is to blame  Is to blame for this  All because  If it weren't for  If it weren't for Spitzer  Screwing around with the  Madam in the first place  There wouldn't be a Governor Patterson  To rule the town  And the city of New York City  So he's upset that Patterson  Is there in the first place  And maybe the tickets  Would still be four bucks  Instead of four fifty  That's true  He thinks  He thinks Spitzer  If it weren't for his madam  No one wants to hear from you  Twitchels  Okay 
[04:18:30]  We did it  You're retarded  I think  You  Bobo  Your point that you're trying to make  Is that  Aside from the madam business  Governor Spitzer  Is actually a good guy  And he would have kept  The affairs  The same  And he wouldn't have increased  The affair hikes  Right  Yeah exactly  There's one thing  I know Spitzer is blind  But last time I checked  He's got a brain  Who's blind?  Spitzer's not blind  Who's blind?  Who's blind?  Who's blind?  Oh no  I know I misworded it  I meant  I meant  I meant  Patterson  I meant  Patterson is blind 
[04:19:00]  Not  Not  Headless  Right  Right so  But you have a specific beef now  With the actual book now  That the madam wrote about  Spitzer right?  Yeah because I gotta get reminded of it again  Did you read the book?  I didn't read it yet  Then why do you have a beef with it?  Because I'm reminded  And I'm tired of hearing about  Who slept with this prostitute  Who slept with this prostitute  Or you slept with A-Rod  How many times do I gotta freak and see 
[04:19:30]  Another A-Rod story in the daily news  Before I want it  I want to rip the paper  Every time I see A-Rod on it  I'm tired of hearing about A-Rod  Yeah I know you're tired of  Oh we got John on line 6  John you're on David and Bobo  Hello John you're on  Dustin  Hello yes  Hello  Me?  Yes you John you're on the air  I'm David and Bobo  What's up?  That's Dustin  Genius  What? 
[04:20:00]  Hello  Hello yes what's up man  Talk  Oh Jesus Christ  What do you want to say?  Conversation  Anyways long time listener  First time caller  Great for you  Yeah and I know  I know your radio guys  Get a lot of pussy  I know that's what  Everyone talks about  And that's why you want  To get into radio  So maybe you guys  Could go out in the room  And talk about you know  What the lightest one you got was  And who got the furthest lately 
[04:20:30]  You know  See if you get anywhere  Because you guys are kind of worthless  But go ahead  Yeah  I'm worthless  I think you're the worthless one  We get all the pussy  Except Twitchels  I'm pussiless  Come on Big A  Relax  You're stepping on everyone  Alright  But um  What Twitchels was saying  Was a good point there Bobo  Did you actually read the book  That the madam put out?  I didn't read it yet 
[04:21:00]  But  He makes a good point  How could you have a beef  With this book  If you haven't read the book?  Well I'll go  I'll go  I'll go  Go ahead and read it  And see  See what the heck  You're going to go to the bookstore  Today after the show  And go buy the book Bobo?  Yeah  I think I might go buy it  Yeah I'm going to go read it  See what the heck  She has to say  Definitely  And she  Because she's really  She's really trashing  Your guy  Spitzer there  You really wanted Spitzer  To stay in the office  Didn't you?  Yeah I did  I knew  I knew I was going to  Expect a bunch of BS  From a guy that 
[04:21:30]  Nobody voted for  I'm tired of these people  That didn't get in  From not being voted in  We got too many people  That are here by appointment  Definitely  What were you saying there Twitchels?  You had something to say about this?  What?  Oh no  So anyway  The answer  To that caller was  I was deep digging  This slut last night  And I got my big dick  All shitting  You 
[04:22:00]  And  And  Oh boy  Anyway  I have to  I have to say  Last weekend  At the stress factory  Was excellent  Thank you Vinny  Oh that's right  That's another story  We didn't talk about  For those of you  That don't know  Big Bobo  Went to  Last weekend  Went to the stress factory  To see Vinny  At his club  Did you have a good time there Bobo?

[04:23:30]  This if nobody  Could read it  They got  They got  Was it a shirt  Promoting the  Promoting the stress factory  No with something  Like a line or something  He said  Oh it was a shirt  That had one of his  Jokes on it  Yeah  And you didn't go ahead  And you didn't buy it  No I didn't  Why not  I didn't  I didn't buy it  Because I didn't  I didn't know much  About him  Oh we got Joe  On line six  Hey David  Yes what's up man  Love you about the show  Hey I just had a question  Sure what's up  I heard a rumor 
[04:24:00]  That you're inbred  Is it true?  No it's not true  At all no  It's not true  Could you explain?  There's nothing to explain  I'm not inbred  Okay that's the end of the story  Period  Period I'm not inbred  Go fuck yourself  Wow David you seem to get  Really touchy by this  I do get touchy  Because I hate these people  What if you were doing  Your radio show  That you do  Once a week  And then someone  Called up the show  And asked  Twitchels  Are you inbred?  How would you react?  I don't know  I guess I would tell  Them the truth 
[04:24:30]  Twitchels  How much cum shoots  Out of your ass  When you take it  Holy shit  Oh my shit  David the Bobo  David the Bobo  A lot less than it would  If I were inbred  Yeah  Also I have to say  Have you ever  As a matter of fact  Have you ever performed  At the stress factory  At Twitchels?  No I haven't  I heard that's like  One of the clubs  Is like a favorite  To the comics  That's like awesome  For those of you  That don't know  Twitchels is an up and coming  Comedian and actor
