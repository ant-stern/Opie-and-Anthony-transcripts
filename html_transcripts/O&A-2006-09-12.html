<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony Cumia, and James Norton engaging in self-deprecating, vulgar jokes about their show and its history.  They discussed the fifth anniversary of 9/11, contrasting their angry, unsentimental approach with the somber tone of other stations.  This led to a debate about war, with Anthony advocating for brutal tactics, drawing historical and fictional (Star Trek) comparisons, amidst frequent interruptions and digressions.  They also discussed YouTube, highlighting Bill Burr's viral expletive-laden stand-up performance, "Lonely Girl 15," and videos of "fat kids."  Numerous callers participated, some agreeing with Anthony's war views, others disagreeing, and one caller, Marge, repeatedly calling for help for the Little Shelter animal shelter, claiming crisis and revealing details about her attire.  A brief Johnny Cash tribute and mention of a Letterman appearance were also included.

A substantial portion focused on Marge from Little Shelter.  The hosts subjected her to highly inappropriate and sexually suggestive questioning, commenting on her physical attributes and sex life, and questioning the shelter's finances.  Marge defended herself, but was contradicted by a caller, Emily Predenti, claiming to be a volunteer, and another, Nathaniel, whose aunt ran the shelter, leading to a heated argument.  The segment concluded with a song about killing kittens and more audio clips of Bill Burr’s expletive-laden Philadelphia performance. Jimmy Norton also shared a sexually explicit anecdote.

The show continued with Anthony changing his name to "Mer," discussions of Sunny D commercials, a caller's opinion that the Naked Cowboy is a motivational speaker, and a video of a man being tased during a traffic stop.  A cockroach briefly interrupted.  A listener contest involving green screen videos was announced, leading to discussions of a planned comedic video featuring a semi-nude host and a Victoria's Secret teddy.  Several more callers phoned in, including a confusing call with two women simultaneously.  Further discussions included John Mayer's album, Star Wars bonus discs, Stephen Colbert's green-screen lightsaber contest (inspiring a poop-related parody), observations of people outside the studio (using offensive language), interns, and a caller recounting receiving oral sex from a midget.

A segment featured discussions with several interns and guest Laszlo.  An intern recounted a sexually explicit anecdote involving a short woman, triggering more crude jokes about midgets and babies.  Several interns were interviewed, with the hosts making sexually suggestive and insulting comments about their appearance and personal lives.  Laszlo discussed directing voiceovers for Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, mentioning Steve Serling's lack of credit. This prompted a discussion of sexist 1980s commercials, including a suggestive Camu jeans commercial featuring Steve Serling’s voiceover. A caller sought technical help transferring iTunes files, leading to vulgarity and technical difficulties.  The conversation then shifted to online gaming (World of Warcraft), in-game theft, and a Craigslist experiment involving a fake woman's ad for a sexual partner with specific fetishes, resulting in explicit responses and death threats.  Discussions of online gambling, online poker's legal issues, government regulation, DVR technology, and anti-commercial-skipping measures followed, concluding with more talk about YouTube and banned commercials.

The final segment began with a caller discussing advertising technology, leading to a rant about unfunny commercials, particularly Budweiser’s lizard commercials.  This transitioned to discussions of DVR patent disputes, the decline of movie theaters and Blockbuster (with disparaging remarks), and Arnold Schwarzenegger's controversial comments about Latina women’s attractiveness.  This sparked a debate on whether his statement was offensive, with further misogynistic and racist remarks from the hosts.  The show concluded with more praise for Bill Burr's insulting stand-up routine, playing audio of his profanity-laden set, including the breaking of his microphone stand.  Numerous callers contributed to the discussions throughout the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  ...dispicable human beings in the country, creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of town hall CM.  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep.  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm gay!  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's terrible. I'm sorry. 
[00:01:30]  It's out, um, Friday-wide.  Okay, terrific.  Goddamn rich horse.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! 
[00:02:00]  That's better.  Oh, my God!  We're obnoxious douches.  It's too early for this crap for most people.  But we've been up for two hours, so deal with it.  Been up for a while. 
[00:02:30]  Look at what I get that Steve's.  I was, like, looking for those clips last night.  All I wanted to do last night, I was obsessed with Eerie Steve.  Say, that's terrible, I'm sorry.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  That's terrible, but I'm sorry.  That's all I was thinking of last night.  I was on a stupid foundry, and I couldn't even find his clip on his site.  No, of course not.  There used to be, people used to make soundboards back in the olden days.  We don't do that anymore.  We could download a whole soundboard.  They had soundboards from all of us.  That was, like, a thing of the past.  Everyone's gone on to, like, MySpace and YouTube now. 
[00:03:00]  Other things.  Doing other things on the internet.  With that, we say good morning.  And welcome to the O.P. Anthony show.  The O.A. virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  We could all breathe today.  We had a deal with yesterday.  Still a nice little reminder driving in today.  Oh, wow.  You know what?  I gotta tell you, that was freaking cool. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah?  You didn't think it was cool?  I don't know.  It's a reminder.  It's cool.  I don't mind.  I'll give it a cool.  I don't mind reminders.  I mind the over-the-top.  Yeah.  Let's make sure we're as sad as humanly possible.  Yeah, I was coming over the hill on the expressway.  Let's ring every drop of sadness out of you before the day ends.  Like, I was watching TV, and at around, I think they called it at 9.30.  Is that when they called it?  At 9.30, they called it.  No more sadness.  And this concludes the fifth anniversary of 9-11 coverage. 
[00:04:00]  All the sadness.  And then I just started breathing.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Oh, good.  They actually said that, though.  This concludes.  Really?  Yeah, and then it went back to regular programming, which was all the horse crap that you  watched on TV at night, but you didn't like the lights in the sky thing?  No, I liked the lights thing, but it's like I was kind of not thinking about it.  You know, I leave in the morning, and I pull out my driveway, and right when I hit the expressway, 
[00:04:30]  you could see, you know, the lights that they put up there, the towers of light that they  put out there as a little memorial.  And then I get closer to Manhattan and get by where you pass the exit to get onto the  Queens of our Bridge, and I go straight, and you could see the entire island.  And the Empire State Building is lit up in red, white, and blue, so that's cool and stuff.  And then you see the lights over there to the left on southern Manhattan.  And it was just kind of like, you know, yeah.  Wherever you are in Manhattan, you can see the lights, which is pretty amazing. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Here's the question I got.  Why don't they keep that up every day?  Because it costs a lot of money.  Ah, yeah.  Well, there you go.  Who's paying for that, Con Ed?  There you go.  There's a cost for everything, huh?  That could be.  There's a cost for everything.  That's a lot of watts of lighting over there.  Hey, we got something cool that we could do for the victims of 9-11, but it's going to  cost money, so we'll only do it once a year.  And it makes it special.  Yeah, whatever.  Special.  I think that's something really cool that would really help the skyline of New York. 
[00:05:30]  Until they build something there in pairs.  Yeah, it's a great memorial.  Yeah.  But it costs money, so I'm sorry.  You only get it once a year.  That's typical.  It's a typical crap.  And then we're just about broadcasting.  We turn on our Panasonic Plasma TVs.  They're all over the studio.  And we see all the newswomen that were in mourning yesterday with their hair pulled back.  Dressed in black turtlenecks. 
[00:06:00]  Barely any makeup and dark clothing.  Yeah.  Oh, the whores are back today.  Their hair is down.  They got their boobs out.  They got their colorful outfits on.  And they're just talking about other crap today.  24 hours later, back to sluts.  They hosed it down and they're moving on.  Back to sluts one day later.  And they're showing video of this guy.  I realized.  I watched a little bit of Bush's speech last night.  Well, all of it because it was kind of short.  Was that a tape speech? 
[00:06:30]  I have no idea.  From a year ago, two years ago.  Yeah, exactly.  What was in there that I could move on to that was new?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Is that the one where we talked about freedom and dedication?  Uh-huh.  And like we have to kind of stay the course?  Yeah.  That was the one.  Yeah, that was the speech.  So you saw it?  That was two years ago.  Oh, it was two years ago?  Yeah, last year it was we have to stay the course because of freedom.  And this year it was because of freedom.  We have to pay the price to stay the cost.  Ah, exactly.  I think it's just the same thing, you know, if you had to take care of the Taliban and 
[00:07:00]  then Osama bin Laden and he did again, again, a verbal connection between bin Laden and  Iraq, which is just like any time he does that, you know, I'm off.  Believe me, I'm off for doing whatever it takes to blow up these savage animals that are  responsible for this and other terrorist attacks. 
[00:07:30]  But like, just don't BS me, okay?  I know there wasn't any kind of Al-Qaeda link with Iraq.  I know, sure, Saddam was a threat at some point, but his whole country was falling apart.  He was pretty much taken care of.  Leave him in there.  He sure took care of the people that were giving him grief.  He certainly knew how to deal with noise.  That's right. 
[00:08:00]  Off with your hands, off with your feet, off with your head.  My son's a rape all he is.  That was pretty much his way of running business.  Now it's just, you know, catastrophe over there.  But whatever.  I'm not even talking about that.  It's just a terrorist thing.  It's like terror, terror.  And I'm sitting there all mad, like we got to do what it takes.  And either they're going to win or we're going to win.  Like, you know, the line in the sand is drawn.  And I'm just laying there watching the speech going, you know something?  We're the most powerful country on earth.  Can we use it? 
[00:08:30]  Do you know why people surrendered back in the days of old?  In like World War II, World War I, the Civil War, all the wars, the old wars.  Do you know why people surrendered?  Why they gave up?  Because we killed so many of them and gave them so much sorrow and anger.  They had no choice.  Could you imagine a September 11th type thing happening to us?  In like night, twice a week.  No, twice a week. 
[00:09:00]  No matter what we did.  Twice a week.  Buildings exploded.  Thousands of people died for, let's say, five years.  Wouldn't you just, as an American, even with your pride and everything, go, give them what they want.  Enough already.  Because you'd be so mad at your government for not protecting you anymore.  So mad.  You'd question the whole morality of your country, of everything.  That's what war lacks these days. 
[00:09:30]  That's what our version of war lacks.  We tried too hard to protect people during a war.  War is horrible.  It must be kept horrible.  I'm talking horrific carpet bombings.  Big steel bombs, the old ones, that Rosie the Riveter used to put together.  I mean, that's the only way.  You can't do these pinpoint precision bombings and take out, you know,  you take out one Abu Ababa, and another Allah is the head guy, 
[00:10:00]  and you take him out, and then is back in.  You can't keep killing these people.  Just replace them with another one.  It's kind of like killing mice in my apartment.  That's it.  I think I got rid of the problem.  You got rid of Abu Nabal Duttal.  Next thing you know, there's another man.  There's a Muhammad Abu Abbas.  You can't take out one at a time.  I'm up to 30 kills, and I'm thinking I'm done.  There's another one roaming around my kitchen recently. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  I see it's turds, little tiny turds.  So he's the next one I got to get rid of.  It never ends is what you're saying.  It doesn't end, not with the leadership like that.  You have to get the people to be so disgusted with what is going on,  and the only way to do that is by killing huge amounts of them  and destroying the places they live in,  the places that make any kind of comfort for them whatsoever,  and just say, look, this is our way of taking care of things 
[00:11:00]  until they come to the table and go, look, okay, we've had it.  The only problem with that is like the Taliban.  The Taliban got removed.  They wouldn't give bin Laden up.  They're like religious fanatics.  Screw bin Laden.  Look, we haven't got him for five years.  The guy's, he's in exile.  Screw him.  If he wants to stay where he is, fine.  If he wants to come out, fine.  That ain't even the goal here now anymore.  It's these little other groups and this, you know,  the insurgents as they call them and things like that 
[00:11:30]  that just really need a thrashing, a pounding.  They don't need to read in the paper about how we're,  oh, awful we treat the prisoners at Guantanamo  or how horrible we do this or that or the other thing.  War is about killing and destroying things.  You can't have a war where we're just pinpointing a guy in a car and things like that.  War has to be vicious and horrid so it ends as quickly as possible.  You ever see that Star Trek episode?  It's wonderful. 
[00:12:00]  Two planets, they were fighting and they used computers to calculate where the bombs would land  and then people had to go to disintegration chambers.  It was very clean and it was to preserve their culture.  So they would just walk in and it's like, oh, bomb hit your city.  You've got to kill yourself and walk into a chamber and kill yourself.  And Kurt came down and he's like, what is going on?  It's the horrors of war that make it horrible and bring you to the peace table.  And that was it.  You know, he blew up his machines.  It's a bad looking special thing. 
[00:12:30]  So you're trying to say that we should learn from Star Trek?  Learn from Star Trek.  All right.  I've got to go out to Tower Records, I guess.  Learn about war.  Learn from Star Trek.  God, you were on a roll until you went to the...  Of course.  What the hell's wrong with this?  I have to ruin everything.  I thought you were ready for ABC radio, man.  Are you kidding?  And then you went...  I was completely getting my logic from Star Trek.  And then we realized you're getting your knowledge from Star Trek.  It's a fantastic episode.  It's like my friend who never got laid used to say. 
[00:13:00]  Unbelievable.  Well, I'm proud of what we did on the radio yesterday.  And we're getting acknowledged in the New York Daily News today.  Most voices are muted on a somber occasion.  Yes.  Take away the shock and the outrage in radio's fifth anniversary coverage of September 11th yesterday.  It was very reminiscent of coverage on the day itself.  The somber tone in much of the media yesterday did, however, drive at least one morning team crazy.  Crazy.  Opie and Anthony of Free FM and XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:13:30]  Here's a quote from Anthony.  On September 11th, I didn't feel somber, said Anthony Cumia.  I was flat out pissed.  I couldn't throw enough curses at those murderers.  I want to kill somebody.  So I don't want to sit around feeling sad now.  I want to do something.  Show me cruise missiles.  Play rock music.  Play rock music?  I don't know where that came from.  Well, it was out of context.  So, like, you were saying, like, in the context of a war, you want, like, loud music.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  That just kind of makes you seem like you really have an irrelevant solution.  A blithering idiot.  Ah, play part cheesy.  I want bombs and rock and roll.  I'm an idiot.  I want cruise missiles.  And I want rock CD.  You'll get nothing and like it.  But that makes sense, because we talk to the boys when they come back to the States, and they have told us they're playing Metallica and Disturbed and such when they're doing their mission.  But O&A were exceptions on a subdued radio day. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  All these losers in New York radio went the sad route, pulling at your heartstrings, playing music, playing those songs that just make you cry and get teary-eyed.  I know enough.  Let's see.  Steve Harvey reinforced a point with gospel songs like Wake Up Everybody.  All right.  Michelle and Joe.  I guess they were for any W.  I have no idea. 
[00:15:00]  Michelle and Joe are good.  Oh, yeah.  They played Whitney Houston's Star Spangled Banner.  Did they?  WRKS, Jeff Fox.  They played Ray Charles' God Bless America.  Jim Kerr, he played Neil Young's Let's Roll and The Who's Won't Get Fooled Again.  See, we won't get fooled again.  That's tough.  Ah!  Dope.  That guy's good, Jim Kerr.  Boy, that was real clever, Jim.  Shut up.  Don't tangle with him.  Shut up.  I don't want him mad at us.  He'll play songs that tie in with us. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, he's going to fight us with rock songs.  How do we compete with that?  We played War Pigs, you dope, but it's not on a playlist.  Yeah, why don't we fight these morning shows by just playing songs with the lyrics that  we need to say what we need them to say.  That's right.  He also played Bruce Springsteen's The Rising.  Oh, boy.  Ew.  And then Scott and Todd, they played Mariah Carey's hero.  Aw.  See, we should have done that. 
[00:16:00]  That's sweet.  Yeah.  Even Imus got all sappy yesterday playing...  Jerks.  Idiot.  Just stupid.  He played I Shall Be Released.  I shall be released.  He also played Warren Zevon's Keep Me In Your Heart.  What?  What is that one?  It's a death song that he wrote before he died.  Ooh, that one. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, his little fond farewell song?  How morbid.  I was just an older man now playing songs that don't tie in.  No, they don't tie in with anything.  And then he played...  As we think on 9-11, he plays on Sugar Pie Honey Bunch.  And then he played the Beatles A Day in the Life.  Ah.  First got some.  I'm proud we didn't get sappy yesterday.  Showed a little anger and...  That's what it's all about for me.  It's just complete anger. 
[00:17:00]  That's all.  Hearts and minds, Anthony.  We have to win the hearts and minds.  Hearts and minds.  Let's say hi to Vinny in Pennsylvania.  Heads and feet.  Vinny!  I like the old logic of we had to destroy the village to save it.  That's my whole...  I love the nom.  That's right.  Give me a Zippo.  Let me burn a hooch.  What's up, Vinny?  What's going on, y'all?  I just wanted to say that yesterday was the five-year anniversary of the 9-11, which we  all know.  It was.  Well, you know what I mean.  Anyway, I just wanted to say that you guys got me through it five years ago down here 
[00:17:30]  in Philly.  And I was going to say that it was just like, with all the crap that they weren't playing  on the radio, you guys are the only people that took my mind off of that.  Completely.  I've heard that on so many radio shows.  Everyone calling up going, you got me through five years ago.  Yeah.  I think every radio show did.  Yeah.  It was whoever you were listening to at the time.  You guys really did.  Got even like...  Thank you, Vinny.  Even like Light FM got people through it.  You got me through.  Thank you.  Right.  Getting you through disasters with Light. 
[00:18:00]  Light FM.  Tint, tint, tint, tint, tint, tint, tint.  Buildings are collapsing.  Tint, tint, tint, tint.  Well, someone's mad on the Instagram.  Oh, no.  What now?  Juan from Boston College.  Juan.  What is he supposed to do?  Talking about the president's speech last night.  Not speak.  He's the freaking president.  Did I say that?  He has to say something.  At least he kept it concise.  And actually, it was toned down politically.  He hit the key points and punched out. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, it was a short speech.  Thank God.  Where does Juan go to school?  Boston College.  The point I'm thinking is he sounded like a robot.  And it was the same speech he's done a million times.  Let's get someone that can relate to the people.  Shake it up.  Where you actually look at the TV and go, man, this guy.  I can relate to what he's saying.  Instead of just being a robot and reading off the thing that has the words going by.  A teleprompter.  What a stick in the mud he is for a college student.  What a bore.  I'm just saying he says it all the time. 
[00:19:00]  He gets on TV and just talks about how we've got to fight this and that.  And generations are going to be affected by this.  And fine, it's the result.  And he always likes to evoke the image of World War II and other struggles against tyranny and stuff.  Well, if you're going to do that, let's do it like we fought that war then.  I understand it's a whole different type of enemy.  But war must be awful.  Carpet bombing.  That brings people to the table. 
[00:19:30]  Carpet bombing.  Look at Israel.  Look at what Israel did.  They ran into friggin' Lebanon and just started bombing the living crap out of everything that moved.  And all of a sudden, you get a ceasefire.  You get some negotiations going back and forth.  People are talking.  What TV show did they get that idea from?  Let me think.  I think it was Stargate.  Stargate.  Jim in Buffalo, what's up? 
[00:20:00]  I'm so tired and dumb right now, but I'm thinking, I don't know, what is the answer to that?  I'm an ass.  There's a real answer to it.  I was, like, really into what Ant was saying.  I'm like, God, he's knowledgeable.  He really should quit this shock.  Star Trek.  And go political talk.  I ruin everything right at the end of my statements.  Speaking of Rush and Sean, run for their money.  And then all of a sudden, he's like, yeah, I get my info from Star Trek episodes.  Star Trek.  Like, holy crap.  Oh, I am a tool.  My God, man.  Let's say hi to Jim in Buffalo.  Jim. 
[00:20:30]  How's it going, guys?  All right, Jim.  Hey, you brought up Quartanamo Bay, and that just reminded me that, you know, them soldiers  that were mistreating them prisoners, some of them are up for death penalty and life in  prison and stuff.  But what about the guys in the CIA camps that tortured these other guys?  God bless them, my friend.  God bless the CIA.  Well, how come they're getting away with it, but these guys are getting...  I know, the poor grunts are the ones that take the fall.  You know, they're interrogating these savages, and then they get brought up on charges. 
[00:21:00]  You mean...  You don't mean an Abu Ghraib.  You mean Guantanamo Bay.  Yeah, Guantanamo.  They're still, you know, yeah, they're getting crap for the way they're treating those people  over there.  But, you know, they got a mattress, they got, they're not getting beatings every night like  any of our prisoners get.  They're issued a Koran, they're able to pray, they're able to do, you know, and do you know  there's a time limit on how long they can be interrogated? 
[00:21:30]  And you can't even change interrogators in the middle, like if the interrogator gets tired,  you can't bring in a new one and interrogate the guy and keep interrogating.  You got to just stop the interrogation, let the guy get some sleep.  Did you get that info from Planet of the Apes?  No, that was, uh...  Oh, according to Cornelius and Dr. Zayas.  Take that off.  Hold him down.  He's stinking up the whole room.  You ruined your years of credibility today.  You know that.  Let me tell you, Star Trek has some wisdom. 
[00:22:00]  I'm like, wow, he knows a lot.  Did College Sheikh Mohammed said, I'll kiss you, but you're so damned ugly?  You...  Wonderful.  You dope.  You're just a nerd.  I am really a geek.  Totally.  Like, there's some guy here trying to tell me something, like I don't know.  Kent the movie guy?  I know they're updating the old Star Treks.  Yeah.  I saw clips of it last night.  All the exterior shots of the ship look awful.  But they look fantastic now. 
[00:22:30]  They're updating all the old footage.  Do they?  You know something?  It might be boring to 99% of the people out there.  But 1% are going, yes, you go, Anthony.  I understand.  But how about we try to get some ratings?  Yeah.  How are they making them more exciting?  I mean, like...  Shut up, Jimmy.  I won't even answer that.  Shut up.  But I would look at the Star Trek.  Oh, my God.  They're adding in CGI...  Oh, wait, no, no.  I wouldn't look at the Star Trek.  ...enterprising.  I would look at a girl's head bobbing up in my lap.  Sorry.  I didn't look at the Star Trek.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  You'd look at Bob's head. 
[00:23:00]  We're just getting started.  We've got something very interesting today.  Oh.  Bill Burr's appearance at the Tweeter Center in Camden has taken on a life of its own.  The video is being viewed like crazy on YouTube.  It's one of the top-viewed videos on YouTube.  Yeah.  You go to YouTube, throw Opie and Anthony into the search, you'll see Bill Burr's performance.  It was just handed in to me.  God bless.  We've got some highlights.  Bill Burr takes on Philly onstage at the Tweeter Center. 
[00:23:30]  We'll do a little of this next, and we'll get into some other things.  Some other things, okay?  But if you want to see the video for yourself, go to YouTube and throw Opie and Anthony into  the search engine.  We have like 800 videos up there now.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  But the Bill Burr one has just taken on a life of its own.  Yeah, I watched it last night.  It's good.  It's the ONA virus, and we're spreading across America.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:24:00]  Opie and Anthony!  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Bounce, bounce. 
[00:24:30]  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Let's go to the phone and say hi to Matt in Boston.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, not much, guys.  Come on.  I just want to say that I've been listening to you since you first got on up here in Boston.  It's been a great, you know, listen to you guys.  Thank you, my friend.  But I just wanted to say that I agree with Anthony on his little spiel about the war and how it should be pretty brutal.  Thank you.  Yeah.  It should be.  You know, I mean, I agree that, you know, I mean, we go too easy on these guys and that, you know, they get away. 
[00:25:00]  It's just maddening.  Eh, the whole country's gone soft like that.  We're not allowed to fight a war like wars are supposed to be fought anymore.  That's all.  The only problem is, sir, that you're not fighting a government.  It's harder with these guys because you're fighting these little fringe groups that move in and out.  And so they don't care if you bomb the country.  They don't care if you do.  Go ahead.  All it does when you bomb the country is it makes the people hate you more and side with that fringe group. 
[00:25:30]  They're like, look what these Western pigs are doing.  It's a real run.  You must use it to turn those people that you are slaughtering against their own.  Make them eat their own.  Doesn't work.  It's not working in Iraq.  They're blowing up pipelines.  They're doing all this stuff to sabotage every good thing the U.S. government or the Iraqi government has done.  They're killing Iraqi police officers.  And who are these dummies blaming?  Are they blaming them?  No, they're blaming us.  Do you know how fanatical the Japanese were years ago?  That was the whole country, though.  Yeah, but they were all a bunch of kooks.  Go ahead, sir. 
[00:26:00]  You go right ahead.  We didn't mean to actually respond.  You jump right in there, Cronkite.  Sorry, we didn't mean to talk out the microphone.  No, no, no.  My apologies, sir.  My apologies.  Hats off to you.  Go right ahead, sir.  Your turn.  Go.  I just wanted to put in my two cents before you started to put in yours.  That's all, man.  Okay, sir.  It's all me.  It's all me.  Go ahead.  You go.  No, I'm just saying that, you know, I mean, we're going over there and saying we're going to spread democracy, but we're pointing a gun to their head.  I mean, it's a two-way street all the time.  I mean, do we go in there and take out the insurgents and all these guys, or do we just let them stew there and then have another 9-11 on our hands? 
[00:26:30]  Well, sir, I don't want to interrupt the commentary that includes the words two-way street, but I will say, I don't know if we're putting a gun to their head, dude.  I mean, it's like, I mean, they're being killed.  Iraqi police officers and civil servants are being blown up on lines for the tests.  I don't know.  How did the country get put back together?  Guys just want to become cops.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I didn't mean to actually get on a roll.  You go right ahead.  Maybe, you know, maybe day late, the dollar is short, or, you know.  Burden to hand. 
[00:27:00]  Burden to hand.  Maybe a penny for my thoughts.  Jeez.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Well, I don't know what to say to that.  Absolutely, you don't.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Krista, the blind girl.  Krista.  Yeah, hi.  I totally agree with Anthony in that I understand that war has to be brutal, but, I mean, do you,  I agree with Jimmy in that these people are not allied to a specific country. 
[00:27:30]  So how are we supposed to?  We're allied.  They're, uh, give her a break.  They're fanatics, but they, but they do have, um, they have a people, they have a, you know,  an ideology, they have a culture, they have things, those things can be destroyed.  Here's how you'll get them eventually.  I'm sorry.  Go right ahead.  I'm sorry.  Probably blind and deaf are the same thing.  You don't realize someone else is talking. 
[00:28:00]  Go right ahead.  Plowthrow.  Oh, jeez.  I just said, I have an idea.  That's it.  Of course.  Go right ahead.  It's the, uh, it's the blind girl show.  I don't, I don't know what I was thinking, trying to talk to my friends on my left ear.  Go ahead.  Uh, yes, uh, Krista.  Go right ahead.  Go right ahead.  It's all, the floor's all yours.  All you now.  Yeah.  Well, you can't destroy an ideology.  You can only destroy the people.  But as you said, they just create, keep creating, you know, and procreating new people.  Right. 
[00:28:30]  So I reiterate the point.  We had a fresh new ones to bring up.  All right, Chris.  Anything else going on?  Of course not.  You're blind.  Oh.  Thank you, Krista.  So, Anthony, why don't you defend yourself then?  Um, I, I did already.  Yeah.  I, I, I said my point and you said your point.  I, I don't, I don't think, you know, I'm going to change your mind.  Yeah.  Uh, you know.  How do you know?  So you try.  It's like the blind leading the blind.  Oh, sorry.  Um.  All right, Krista.  Yeah.  Because we don't have enough time to, to do that. 
[00:29:00]  Fine.  We got to get some laughs in.  Yeah.  Cool.  We don't have time to change your mind.  I'd like to probably change your socks because I'm sure they don't match.  Let's go to Charlie, who's listening to us on WISP in Philly.  It would be Anthony and Norton.  How's it going, guys?  Hey there, Charlie.  Hey, Charlie.  Two, two comments.  First one.  Let's go with one.  We'll see how we do it.  Hold on, hold on.  Bert and Philly, hold on.  We're not done with Krista yet.  Bert and Philly, thanks, Krista, for trying to shine some light on the situation. 
[00:29:30]  Too bad you pointed the flashlight at your thigh.  Okay.  I've had enough of her in her black and blue knees.  Stupid.  We love Krista.  Always crunking into the end tables.  Dented shins.  She's been with us a long time.  A long time.  Charlie, go ahead.  Hey, yesterday, all day long on WISP, Barsky Show, Matt and Huggy and Kid Chris, they were  getting calls all day about Bill Burr's act.  Everybody in Philly loved it. 
[00:30:00]  They said it was the best show of the night.  Noah's, wow, not only did everyone in Philly, this video is spreading all over the freaking  world now.  Yep.  It's one of the hottest videos on MyTube.  YouTube.  Or YouTube.  Are you starting on MyTube?  I would like MyTube.  That's like the MySpace.  MyTube.  Well, because we like MySpace, too.  Look at MyTube, baby.  I'm sure there's probably someone working on MyTube.  MyTube is taken.  Believe me, MyTube is taken.  I like the MySpace. 
[00:30:30]  I like the YouTube.  So is your space, yeah.  I like the YouTube.  I like the MySpace.  No, we're talking about YouTube, obviously.  The video's up there.  You just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  You can see it for yourself.  Now we can tell that 9-11 is over.  The news is now racing go-karts in Lake Ronkonkoma, Long Island.  There you go.  Back to fun.  Back to business as usual.  Hose it down.  Fun, fun, fun forever.  Hose the sorrow off, and we're back to hijinks on the news.  Because I'm sure the people that lost a loved one during the 9-11 attack. 
[00:31:00]  They're go-karting today.  They're go-karting as well today.  They only needed one day to feel sad.  Just give me a day.  Yeah, they're back at the carnival and the amusement parks today.  By the way, MyTube is taken.  It's a site.  It's actually a gay site, and the tube is a Habitrail reference.  Why do I have to say that?  Oh, MyTube.com is a porn search website.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Is that the one run by McGreevy?  You can see the Bill Burr video on YouTube.com, and I watched it, and it's unbelievable. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  The way he's just defiantly, basically, he's verbally spitting in their faces while they're  all screaming at him, and at the end of the set, and the audio isn't great on some of  these because they're like handheld phones and cameras and stuff, but I was up last night  at 1.30 in the morning laughing, doubled over, watching Bob Kelly throw up.  Oh, that's a great clip.  Bob showed his ass, and Bob got sick, and then Bob is throwing up, and I just forgot  that I'd done this, and he looks over, and I have my ass in his face, and I'm just watching 
[00:32:00]  this dummy.  There's like 10 different clips of Bob running out of the studio trying not to throw up,  so he has the weakest.  Go watch the Bill Burr video.  Go watch all this other stuff.  The weakest stomach I've ever seen on somebody.  I'm going to punch it.  Wait until you see Anthony's video.  He's going to bring that in eventually.  Oh, yeah.  Where he pukes because of the guy with the ear pus.  Yeah.  That's all that.  I can't get enough.  I can't get enough of YouTube.  I just check out Opie and Anthony videos, and now I'm spreading out and checking out  other videos as well.  It's like any other thing on the net. 
[00:32:30]  You start somewhere, and then you end up somewhere and go, how'd I get here?  I found a great new Johnny Cash song, Redemption.  Look it up on YouTube.  You can watch him sing it acoustically in front of a bunch of people.  Well, Opie went to turn me on to something on YouTube, and then I was like, oh, yeah.  I've been keeping tabs on this one.  It's that chick.  Lonely Girl 15.  Lonely Girl 15.  Is that her name?  I think so.  What's that?  This chick, they've determined it's a fake, unfortunately. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, a lot of people are.  This chick that just makes videos in her little bedroom about her boyfriend.  And her dad.  Her dad and being grounded and house arrest.  And then she tries to prove science wrong.  Apparently, she's 18.  She says she's like 15.  All right.  And she's got her goofy boyfriend and a father that's like a little overbearing with her and  stuff.  And it's done in her bedroom.  And it's pretty slick.  Like it's done a little too slick for a girl just to, you know, 15 year old girl to throw 
[00:33:30]  together and put on YouTube.  Well, the production is great.  The production is great.  The sound, the lighting is really nice.  The compression on the video is good.  I mean, it's put together too well.  And she's really just goofy.  She's a goofy girl.  And it's kind of funny to watch.  And then I ended up watching that.  And then it took me to some other site of some Australian girl that makes fun of her  and exposes her as a fraud and just mocks her and imitates her.  But you end up like you just you start at one place looking like O&A videos and you 
[00:34:00]  end up someplace completely different.  I saw an old Real Rock TV thing from our WAAF days.  And then I clicked on another one and saw our pal Ozone, John Ostoland, introing a silver  chair.  Jesus.  Hey, here's a silver chair.  Hey, I got all our Real Rock TV episodes.  Really?  Actually, they're in VHS.  I think they're in Club Soda Kenny's Garage. 
[00:34:30]  Half my stuff is in Kenny's Garage.  The other half is at my mom's house.  You should have that transferred over.  Get them on DVD.  Spuds Buckley up there?  I got it somewhere.  Spuds?  I'll find some Spuds Buckley eventually.  You know what?  Maybe.  I've been hearing that since 2002.  That's why I say eventually.  Club Soda Kenny, I'll tell them to bring in the VHS copies of Real Rock TV.  We'll get those up on YouTube as well.  Yeah.  But Lonely Girl 15, they're filmmakers.  And, you know, they're.  Is that what they are?  Really?  Yeah, they're filmmakers. 
[00:35:00]  And it's just something they're doing.  But every time they throw a video up on YouTube, it gets like 200,000 hits.  Oh, it's huge.  Yeah.  Like it's nothing.  She's like the Dane Cook of YouTube.  Right.  But anyway, Charlie, back to you.  So Barski and Kid Chris and the gang helping us out yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  And the fans in Philly, I mean, they love the show.  And they said Bill Burr was the best.  You know, I've watched the video a bunch of times, and then I read the comments, and some 
[00:35:30]  people are like, yeah, it's all right, but he curses a lot.  That's not too impressive.  People don't understand.  Bill Burr had an act.  He went on that stage.  He started doing his act where he knows every single word.  And for whatever reason, because he's a great comic, Philly turned on him.  And so he said, all right, screw that.  And he threw his whole act out the window, as they say, and then made up crap for 15 straight  minutes and killed the place.  Yeah.  So he threw a few curses in.  Right. 
[00:36:00]  With some filler.  And to just nail it right in their faces.  Like, he was slinging feces at the audience like an ape.  I was being attacked by 10,000 people.  You're going to criticize because he used a naughty language?  Yeah.  Who cares?  I guess he did curse over 100 times in the 15 minutes, though.  Wow.  Someone counted him.  Bravo.  That's fine.  At 7 o'clock, or right around there, we'll play some clips from Bill Burr taking on Philly  at the Tweeter Center this past Saturday night.  Thank you, Charlie.  Say hi to the gang at YSP for us. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, Opie, real quick.  Can I make a comment about the Letterman appearance?  Yeah, go ahead.  I don't know if anybody noticed.  I mean, the whole appearance was great.  But when Dave asked or made the comment, you guys have been fired a couple times.  Anthony kind of drops his head a little bit with that embarrassing smile.  Yes, we have, Dave.  And Opie jumps up out of his chair like he just won the heavyweight championship of the  world.  It was awesome.  That's like, yeah.  Yeah, that was real emotion.  Yeah, been fired.  There's an excitement to being fired.  I can't explain it. 
[00:37:00]  You guys rock.  All right, thanks.  Yeah, I'm not sad about that stuff anymore.  There's a happiness that comes with being fired.  And knowing you're taking on the whole radio world and you're not scared of being fired.  You're not scared of not listening to your bosses.  It just seems to have worked out.  It has worked out.  So screw it.  And now we're going to try to keep our jobs for a while.  Jared in Boston, what's up?  Hey, boys.  YouTube is like internet heroin.  I find myself at 2.30 in the morning up and I'm saying one more video. 
[00:37:30]  And that last blurb that they put in the very end with the two more suggestion videos, it's  like, oh, this one looks good.  Yeah, that keeps you going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Punch it out.  Hey, Laura.  And we were talking about it before the show today.  YouTube has found a way to get people to watch videos that has not much to do with porn.  Yeah.  How do they do that?  Videos that you wouldn't really care about.  Most people that go online at night, especially late night, they're looking for porn, right? 
[00:38:00]  Mm-hmm.  They're looking for some kind of titillation.  Yes.  But with YouTube, you're like, for some reason, you don't care as much about the porn angle.  Just give me a little action, some laughs.  They're smart to not allow it at all because if it was up there, that's what you'd look  at, but now it's like-  It would just be full of porn.  Right.  There's so many other good things to watch.  You're right, though.  It's the one thing online I do that's healthy and fun and not disgusting.  I don't feel like I need a shower after I'm on YouTube.  Yeah.  And everyone is trying to outdo each other because you want to be one of the top-viewed 
[00:38:30]  videos.  Yep.  So you try to get as clever as possible.  It's just taking over the world and we're loving it.  And our videos are going up there every day.  We're up to, I don't know, close to 800 videos, I hear.  Porn sites have gotten things that allow porn videos or pictures.  They always turn into just horrible porn star videos.  I call it fake because it's just porn stars. 
[00:39:00]  But even the ones that turn out, they're supposed to be like a webcam in a college dorm.  Remember those?  Those were all the rage for a while.  And it just turned into hired strippers in a set, like in a house or something that they're  renting.  Yeah, stupid.  They originally start out with a pretty cool idea and then it turns into something where  you're like, I'll get this off of here.  I don't want to watch these dancing, you know, dance by night whores.  Language.  Hey, this is...  I like the regular college girl cams.  This chick has been calling all morning.  Catherine, what's up? 
[00:39:30]  What's up?  Why do you keep calling?  Hi, Catherine.  Welcome to the program.  Because you...  I said hi, Catherine.  Welcome to the program.  Hello.  Thank you.  Thank you for having me.  You're welcome.  You guys are phenomenal.  Really.  Thank you.  You are.  Thank you.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Thank you.  I used to love those Wow Wednesdays.  I'd drive down the pike and see the...  You used to.  See the...  See the...  See the Wow through the windows and the New Balance building, et cetera, et cetera, et  cetera.  All right.  Et cetera.  But in any case...  Jesus. 
[00:40:00]  You guys have such a different perspective on us girls and that's...  Can we?  And the webcam thing.  Come on now.  What do you mean?  Oh, that's stupid.  You need to give us a little bit of credit.  Back up.  What are you on, Catherine?  Yeah, what are you doing today?  What's the poison?  You drinking or drugging?  Neither.  You sound a little wasted.  I would attribute it mostly to Red Bull and green tea.  Ew.  Wow.  Red Bull and green tea? 
[00:40:30]  Jesus.  Green tea and honey, it's phenomenal.  Oh.  You must be chafed.  What do you got in you?  Oh.  It's like a shuttle launch when she sits down.  I'm a bartender and I work late and my schedule is different.  It's different than most other people.  Have you gone to bed yet?  Honestly?  No, no, no.  Just confuse me.  Tell a half a lie.  Tell a lie that was based in truth but somehow got twisted. 
[00:41:00]  Do you want my life story then?  No.  Only if it ends shortly.  It might.  You're supposed to laugh.  I don't know.  It might be interesting.  To end up like this, there might be something that happened a few years ago.  All right.  This is what we do for you today.  We want your life story in one minute.  And don't include incest and not college.  Go.  And you start right now.  You got a minute.  Life story.  Go.  My parents pampered the shit out of me and I rebelled the shit out of that. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  Hold on, stupid.  Catherine.  Try to keep the...  Catherine, I hate you.  I apologize.  I'm sorry.  You stopped cursing.  Try to keep the slang words.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  You know what?  You...  And let me continue with my story.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  That's my mother's fault.  My parents were former hippies who did everything that I was never supposed to do and told them  I never did.  And here I am.  And that's your life story.  Now, how is there not a movie built around that? 
[00:42:00]  What is it that they did that you never did?  Did they say we used to call radio shows and be interesting?  We would call radio shows and not suck, honey.  Yeah, who are they thinking of playing you in the movie?  Reese?  Reese Witherspoon?  Yeah.  Are they going to go with Scarlett?  Who are they going to...  Who do you think would play you in that exciting movie of your life, Catherine?  Right.  You know, I resent that and I'm a little more subdued when it comes to giving up the details  of my personal life. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, Catherine.  Yes?  Call back when you have something.  Please.  Let's say hi to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  That was the worst life story I ever heard.  Horrid.  Well, my parents went with me to ask me.  And here I am.  Great.  I'm snorting daddy's money.  Thank you, Bird in Philly.  Paul, Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey, Paul.  Hey, you guys were talking about YouTube earlier?  Yeah.  Yeah, when you type in Fat Kid in there, you get all these videos, man.  It's great.  Some pretty great audio for you guys, too.  Fat Kid?  Fat Kid, yeah. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  I will check out Fat Kid.  Fat Kid.  What's so good about Fat Kid?  It's just funny, man.  It's funny stuff to check out?  Yeah, it's funny.  They either get it picked on or, you know, they're falling and doing something stupid.  All right.  Just Fat Kids screwing up?  Yeah.  That is funny.  Of course it is.  All right, cool.  You've got to love it.  It's always funny.  Thank you, Paul.  All right, man.  Hey, after the break, we're going to play some clips.  They're heavily bleeped because we're on this side of the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's actually funnier.  Later on this morning, we're going to play it unedited. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, don't worry.  The entire thing on XM Satellite Radio.  Don't worry.  I missed it in Camden over the weekend.  But before we go to break, it's three years ago today that we lost Mr. Cash.  Before we play Johnny, can I just say I'll be at the Stress Factory tonight?  I forgot I had a benefit to do.  I'm such a dummy.  My friend's son is very sick with cancer.  Myself, Patrice, Voss, talent.  It's a very good show.  Eight o'clock, I think, at the Stress Factory tonight.  Five, four, five.  Ha, ha. 
[00:44:00]  If you want, please come down.  Love to have you.  Three years ago?  Yes.  Three years ago.  Johnny Cash.  Yeah.  Dead.  Three years ago.  I swear I would have said last year.  I know.  Three years ago.  He died right after his wife, man.  She died like six months after her.  Less than a year after.  Not even.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw his last performance on YouTube.  It's really sad, man.  He can't sing.  He's got like laryngitis and he's really old.  Yeah.  Really sad to watch.  You know, it was like a thing at the Cash Ranch where I guess he would sing for little 
[00:44:30]  local groups or whatever it was.  They were all like loving.  There's a video of this?  Yes.  Was it ever broadcasted?  No, no, no.  It's shot from an audience.  You could see guys walking in front of him.  It's like a hang.  I mean, you could tell it's where people had congregated to watch him before, like in  like one of his little, like in a Johnny Cash, you know, place.  Like he never left his house, I think.  Yeah.  It was probably someplace on his property or something like that.  And it's very casual.  Well, it was shot from a little video camera, yeah.  Wow.  Everything's ended up on YouTube. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Amazing.  All right.  Here's a little tribute to Johnny Cash three years ago today.  It's Hurt.  Hurt.  And it features a little Jimmy Norton.  It was done as a tribute.  Does it?  Yeah.  I love this.  We'll go to break with this.  It's the RNA virus spreading across America.  Can we get a taste of Johnny Cash doing Hurt?  This song is deeply depressing.  I Hurt Myself Today.  Here he goes.  Hello.  I'm Johnny Cash. 
[00:45:30]  Should have had Joaquin Phoenix sing this.  I Hurt Myself Today.  I Hurt Myself Today.  Did ya?  To see if I still feel.  Well, do ya?  I focus on the pain.  Did ya?  The only thing that's real.  Is it?  The needle tears a hole. 
[00:46:00]  Does it?  The old familiar sting.  Is it?  Try to kill it all away.  Do ya?  But I remember everything.  Do ya?  What have I become?  My sweetest friend. 
[00:46:30]  Everyone I know goes away in the air.  Do they?  All right.  We get it.  And the new lab is all in it.  Yeah, could I?  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable. 
[00:47:00]  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  That.  That.  That vibe.  So I was reading the message board yesterday.  What are you complaining about now?  Uh, wax bag?  Yeah.  Apparently.  Here's your strawberries.  Thanks, buddy. 
[00:47:30]  There's a whole thread dedicated to some guy and a bunch of other people, all pissed off  that we were eating on mice.  Really?  You believe that?  Yep.  So I, you know, timed in and said, I didn't think it was that bad.  We got some food sent to us.  Thank you to Meredith from the Helium Comedy Club in Philly.  Thank you.  We got some fruits and some muffins.  Muffins.  The food is awesome. 
[00:48:00]  Thank you.  Helium Comedy Club in Philly.  Our new friends, by the way.  Yes.  They run a good joint down there.  Nice joint.  One of our regulars calling in, Marge.  Irregulars.  Yeah, she's irregular.  She's from Long Island.  And she works at, what?  Or she volunteers at Little Shelter.  The Little Shelter.  What is that?  Where animals go to die?  Good morning, gentlemen.  She doesn't even acknowledge you.  Yeah, what's up, Marge?  It's Little Shelter.  We are in a crisis situation. 
[00:48:30]  Aren't you always?  I get a lot of mailers from Little Shelter.  And you're always in crisis.  Who's running things over there?  There's something competent that can't control the money.  Little Shelter is corrupt.  The person that's being siphoned to terrorism?  I think so.  Hey, Marge.  Marge, Marge.  You know who else is a big animal rights activist?  No.  Richard Pryor's ex-wife.  Oh.  So I help her.  I go to RichardPryor.com and I help Jennifer Pryor.  Oh.  I don't know you. 
[00:49:00]  I knew you had a soft spot.  Your husband never made me laugh.  I knew you had a soft spot for animals.  But to get that.  No, no, no.  I have a soft spot for animals that I can put duct tape around and remove their claws  and get them to run up a habit trail and make me and my friend happy.  Unfortunately, that soft spot doesn't last long once he's alone in a room with him.  Let me just tell you about who runs Little Shelter.  Okay.  No.  Oh, boy.  A lady by the name of Mary Ann Chernofsky who has been running Little Shelter.  Sorry.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:49:30]  You're running out of time, Marge.  Let me tell you something.  Just let your animals at Little Shelter.  You're running out of time.  Make your point.  All right.  Marge.  The point is that we have turned on the ovens.  We do not have any food.  We're preheating as we speak.  No food in the pantry.  I agree.  No food for them.  Good point, Marge.  Good.  Show them who's boss.  We have a program.  Gentlemen.  They were getting a little too fat anyway.  We have a program called...  Just like chicks. 
[00:50:00]  Who wants a fat pet?  I know.  And your pets don't have at least the dignity to go throw up after a meal.  That's right.  Can I just say one thing?  Well, we like chiming in every so often.  I just want to know.  I know Little Shelter was...  Get this.  Little Shelter was around when I was 10.  That's right.  I was 10 years old and Little Shelter was right around the corner from me.  How could it still be in this crisis?  It's like a going out of business sale with a store that never really goes out of business. 
[00:50:30]  You know that, Marge?  I think this is a ploy to get money.  I think you guys are fine.  Anthony.  Yes.  We have no money.  Our shelter is run on pennies.  So you're telling me 30, 35 years?  Gentlemen.  So on March, while you're living the high life and highfalutin' around town, those poor animals are suffering.  Those animals never suffer at least.  And how about you move to Wine Dance instead of living in Elwood, a nice exclusive neighborhood in Huntington? 
[00:51:00]  I don't live in Elwood.  I'm talking about the Little Shelter.  Marge, get to your point.  The ovens are just about heated.  We're getting the keys for the cages.  Let's go.  Hey, Marge, you know what I do when I see a little bushel of kittens?  I pick up a golf club and I go kitten hunting.  You know what a golf club sounds like when it thuds into a little white, upturned kitten belly?  Anthony.  I asked you a question, Marge.  Do you know the dull thud of a golf club? 
[00:51:30]  What do you need?  You know something, Marge?  What?  I do.  We need food.  I send money.  We need food.  She's the animal food.  You gotta love Marge.  Hey, wait, Marge, you need food for the animals?  Yes.  Why don't you feed them the carcasses of the animals that didn't make it?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, you know, that's a brilliant idea.  They don't would notice if they were eating the guy that was in the cage next to him.  If it's good enough for the Koreans, it's good enough for the dogs.  Gentlemen, can I just say one thing?  Gentlemen, where?  Marge, you're not participating in a conversation. 
[00:52:00]  You're not letting me say.  I'm trying.  What are you wearing?  You really want to know?  Yes.  Yeah, Marge.  An old t-shirt and panties.  Ew.  All right.  What kind of?  All right.  Now we're...  Well, hold on.  Somewhere Bob Kelly's puking.  Now, hey, hey, guys.  What kind of panties?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We run our own radio show.  Yeah, we help you, and you help us.  That's right.  You help us.  You haven't helped us enough.  You help us a little more, and we'll let you say whatever you want.  Quid pro quo, Marge.  And we're talking on millions of people, Marge. 
[00:52:30]  Quid pro quo.  Quid pro quo.  You tell us things, we kill your animals.  Old t-shirt and panties so far.  How old of a lady are you?  No comment.  Tell us, Marge.  No?  Over...  Over...  Give it to us in dog years, and we'll figure it out.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the deal.  No, no, no, no.  We tell you when the deal is the deal, or whatever.  No, no, when it comes to age, gentlemen, I tell you what the deal is.  The first time you had laid, did you have to take off your Lincoln for president button?  There is...  Wait, you have to give it... 
[00:53:00]  You have to give it something.  Like, are you over 60?  A little.  Okay.  Over 60.  All right.  What's your t-shirt say?  All right.  You're still bangable.  Oh.  Regan for president.  All right.  Regan.  Cool.  That's good.  We had a president at Regan for eight years.  Yeah.  Good thing you didn't support Regan.  Brian's funny.  Hey, I'm the president.  What else do you want to know?  Are you wearing a bra?  Never.  I never wear a bra.  You're an old hippie, aren't you?  I...  You're pretty much...  Taking care of the animals.  You got hairy armpits?  I...  No. 
[00:53:30]  You don't shave your...  All right, wait.  You're perfectly clean shaven.  Everywhere?  Everywhere, Marge?  No.  Not everywhere.  All right.  Just the whiskers on your chinny-chin-chin.  You got a little bichon frisee somewhere?  Can I tell you something?  What kind of panties, Marge?  Yeah, what kind of panties?  Fruit of the loom.  Oh.  You know, Marge, you have the sex appeal.  What?  You have the sex appeal of a starving puppy. 
[00:54:00]  Not exactly.  Not when I walk down the street.  All right.  All the hotness of the limp carcass that is pulled out of that machine, that infernal machine.  All right, listen.  You're about as sexy as a five-year-old's face when they see you pick up that puppy by  the tail.  Can I tell you something?  And throw it into a dumpster because it didn't have any food and it was hot in its little  cage.  Let's get back.  I mean, I don't mind talking about myself.  Good.  Keep talking.  All right.  You know what?  We like you, Marge.  Marge has given us a little something, so now you get to say.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Quid pro quo, Marge. 
[00:54:30]  That's right.  The Training Wheels program at Little Shelter, we help animals that live in homes where the  people are impoverished.  Are the homes roomy?  They, they, this is the program and also the feral cat program.  So you ran with the spring lamb, Marge?  Yes.  Yes, I did.  And we need food.  We need food to feed the animals in the Training Wheels program.  We also need food to feed the animals in the feral cat program. 
[00:55:00]  We've been around for 18 years to try to help.  All right.  Enough info for now.  You're breastfed, didn't you, Marge?  Yes.  All right.  In the book, they don't say tough engine.  It says thirsty work.  One more question.  Thirsty work.  Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I ask one thing and then you can ask me anything you  want and I, I'm going to get ready to, I'm going to, uh, put you on hold if you, you  know, God damn it, Marge, I frigging send money every time I get one of those goddamn  mailers.  I, I write a check and send money.  Oh, thank you.  No, not thank you.  You're, you're squandering it. 
[00:55:30]  I say, I send poison food.  You squandered it, Alice.  Our leader.  You squandered it.  That is a volunteer president.  Thank you, Marge.  You cannot take one cent.  I think you better get an accountant on the job there.  Someone's, uh, got their hand in the tail and there's puppies dying because of it.  That's right.  You can bring in any accountant you want and they will say that we are so clean.  All right.  All right.  Marge, uh, what kind of body do you have?  You got the t-shirt, no bra.  Right.  A little curious.  A little curious.  I, I really can, I can still wear a bikini. 
[00:56:00]  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  What kind of.  The island of bikini?  Uh, you know.  What kind of shape are you in?  Um, you know, give us some, give us some numbers.  Very good shape.  What, we'll say five, six and a half.  Five, six and a half.  How much do you weigh?  130 pounds.  All right.  That's all right.  And, um, very attractive lady.  Uh, 36, uh, long?  Um, 36, 36 C.  Mm-hmm.  36 C?  C.  C as in candy. 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  Oh.  As in Kenya, please give me some food.  I'm starving to death in a hot cage.  All right.  Hold on, Marge.  We're not done with you yet.  Yeah, hold on.  Yeah, hold on.  One thirty, five, six and a half, one thirty is mediocre.  I like a little story.  I'm not anorexic.  I'm not saying you're anorexic.  I think that I'm very perfectly proportioned.  All right.  When's the last time you had sex?  You know what, you're five, hold on, she's five, six and a half, hundred and what, thirty  five pounds?  Yeah.  So why don't you just, you know, uh, skip a meal or two and feed some of these dogs? 
[00:57:00]  Then you would get down to a more acceptable weight.  All right.  And the puppies would, uh, uh, they wouldn't be as skinny.  Stop dipping into the kibble, Marge.  All right.  That's what we're trying to say.  All right.  Here's, here's the thing.  All right.  We need food.  No, no, you didn't answer my question, Marge.  Oh, that's true.  What is the question?  When is the last time you had sex?  And here's the rest.  The answer is with a non-white.  You know, I have to tell you this.  Yeah.  You know, I'll, in, in order to help the animals.  No, no, no, no.  You have to answer the question.  Okay. 
[00:57:30]  Please tell me you're an old lesbian.  In order to help the animals, I'd do anything.  But.  Yeah.  You would?  There's one thing I will not answer.  What?  Anything that has to do with my sex life.  With black people.  Oh.  With what?  With your sex life.  Why?  Marge.  Because that is very personal.  Marge.  Yeah, but you're talking to over a million people right now.  With, with, with checkbooks.  With checkbooks out.  So you said you'd do anything for these animals, but you won't give out a little bit of personal  information.  Not about the case, but about yourself.  Tell us what you do late at night with the peanut butter.  I've given you all information.  You can, honestly. 
[00:58:00]  What other information do we want, Marge?  We don't care about anything else.  Yeah.  We want to know the last time an orderly snuck in.  Hey, listen.  All right.  And treated your backside like a pin cushion.  You tell me about your sex life.  Let my friends laugh.  You tell me about your sex life.  Okay.  Maybe.  All right.  All right.  Jimmy Norton is going to fill you in on his sex life, Marge.  I had, I had sex last night.  Um, I had sex with my girlfriend and it was going really good, but then I was having trouble  getting to where I need to go.  So what happened?  We stopped for a few minutes and then we just kind of made out while I helped myself along. 
[00:58:30]  And might I say, it looked like somebody, I don't know what happened, but apparently  somebody broke in my room and shot a yogurt gun all over the place.  You are, so, I'm Jim Norton and that was my story.  You are sadly, you are sadly in need of Viagra.  No, no, no.  That's not the trouble I was having.  No, it was.  The trouble I was having wasn't, it wasn't achieving.  It was finishing.  Hold on.  You're too young to have these intermittent problems. 
[00:59:00]  No.  She said it was an intermittent problem.  No, no, no.  I, no, not intermittent.  It's an ongoing problem.  You know, we're talking to you instead of playing the Bill Burr set from the Twitter  Center in Canada, by the way.  You're lucky.  Everybody wants to hear that, not you, Marge.  Well.  Marge, I got a song for you that I want to play.  All right.  Okay.  We have a lot of people that love animals out there.  Animal lovers.  They're filling up the phone lines, by the way.  Anthony.  Oh, thank you.  Anthony admitted today that he actually sends checks to your organization.  Yes.  It's an institution.  And people know over the years that we're into animals, actually. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, thank you.  And they send in their songs.  Would you like to hear one of them?  I would love to.  All right.  Here's a little ditty for Marge.  Oh, thank you.  Listen close.  This is nice.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting, it helps a lot if you kill a kitten. 
[01:00:00]  Mark my words, cause from where I'm sitting, you can't go wrong if you kill a kitten.  Sounds like Broadway star Stephen Lynch.  It's nice, right?  It's nice, right, Marge?  Oh, I love it.  Jesus.  What's wrong with her?  There's no crime that you'll be committing. 
[01:00:30]  I know the law.  You can't kill a kitten.  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting, you'll get plenty when you kill a kitten.  Now some suggestions, right?  What do you think, Marge?  I think that you need to listen to this when you're having sex with your brother. 
[01:01:00]  Break its spine, brush it with your shoe, as long as you kill a kitten.  Listen up.  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten, she'll like you better when you kill a kitten.  And I'll quote the Bible, cause that's where it's written. 
[01:01:30]  If ye loveth Jesus, ye must kill a kitten.  Blush him down the can, hit him with your van, throw him at a train, make him snort cocaine,  drown him in a lake, bake a kitty cake, stick some TNT. 
[01:02:00]  Ah, that stupid beep, beep, perish the thought.  Ah, you get the idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ew.  Ew. 
[01:02:30]  Killing kittens isn't easy.  And if the thought makes you feel queasy, grab a pitchfork from the shed.  And kill a puppy dog instead.  Yeah.  Kill a kitten, you got to kill a kitten, a little furry kitten. 
[01:03:00]  You got to kill that kitten, kill a little f**k.  Beep, beep.  Ah.  Kill a kitten, kill a...  Oh, forget it.  Drives you nuts.  Kill a...  Kill a...  Kill a...  Beep, beep, beep.  Marge.  Beep, beep, beep.  Marge?  Yes, sir.  Hi, Marge.  Did you like that song?  I liked it very much.  I thought it was beautiful, as a matter of fact. 
[01:03:30]  All right, let's say hi to Emily.  I guess she volunteers at Little Shelter with Marge.  You know, I played a benefit for the Little Shelter once down at Sergeant Pepper's on Jericho  Turnpike.  I'll go ahead, Marge.  You just keep it up there.  Played a benefit.  If you would do something for us...  Hold on, Emily wants to talk.  Before I was a big star.  By the way...  Emily wants to talk!  Emily?  The animals aren't starving.  They're killing themselves.  Get away from you.  Emily?  Hi.  Hi.  You're on with Marge.  Just to first tell you guys, I love you guys so much. 
[01:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you, Emily.  But, um, Marge, you are not as attractive as you're painting yourself as to be.  Uh-oh.  How do you know?  And the Little Shelter is not in that crisis.  I went to Colmack High School 10 years ago.  We volunteer there all the time every couple of months.  Oh.  Pulling your leg.  Uh, what is...  She is no 130 pounds.  There's no way she is 130 pounds.  How fat a pig is she?  We're talking, we're talking, most of the women that volunteer there are granola, Birkenstock 
[01:04:30]  wearing, you know, loving hippies, but there's no crisis with food.  No way.  I don't know who...  Uh, I'm not sure who you are, but you're not...  Emily Predenti, Marge.  Emily Predenti.  We volunteer there all the time.  Same group of girls from Colmack High School.  I...  They always come around.  Emily, Emily, I don't know who you are, but...  Whoever you are, whoever you are, you are doing such a disservice to the animals.  Such a disservice.  The Little Shelter, the Little Shelter is great, but you guys are not in crisis. 
[01:05:00]  All she's got to do is, I'm going to ask you guys for food donation, but they are not living  up with Penny.  Emily, take a pill.  Emily.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  Oh.  Emily, if you worked at Little Shelter, you would know that we ran out of food for the  animals in the Training Wheels program.  Not only do I think...  What's the Training Wheels program?  She's got her own pockets.  She's got her own pockets.  Oh, did she?  Emily.  She's got her own pockets.  She's got her own pockets.  Emily.  She's pretty menopausal.  Emily, shut up.  Oh. 
[01:05:30]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Hey, you're going to take that?  Emily.  What is the Training Wheels program?  Describe it.  No, we don't need to know.  Emily, now, how much does Marge weigh, you think?  Oh, God.  She's like a melting snow cone.  She's so fat.  Ugh.  Uh-huh.  Fatso.  Emily, God is going to get you for this.  Oh.  She's giving Marge comebacks.  Why don't you yell at Walter while you're at it, stupid?  You know what, Marge?  You're an interrupting old bag.  You know what, Marge? 
[01:06:00]  Emily, you are a disgrace.  Let these two go at it.  You are a disgrace to your whole family.  Wow.  When you come on the air and blatantly lie about Little Shelter and the work that we do.  Okay, Marge.  You should be ashamed of yourself and you should go to church and do a confession.  Okay.  That's it.  I will.  And tell the folks that are listening that everything you're listening that you are a blatant liar. 
[01:06:30]  Who's the president of that whole organization over there?  Mary Ann Shinovsky, the finest woman you ever wanted.  Okay, listen.  That does not care.  Oh, I'm not saying that any of you guys are fine, but you're really pulling their legs.  I don't know how the heck you managed to get on this line at this time of the morning.  Get her up the air, Emily.  Not out of code.  Emily, Emily, hang up and hang your head in shame.  Oh.  Wow.  Emily, don't take that.  What do you got for Marge?  Oh, there's really not much left for her. 
[01:07:00]  No, you have nothing to begin with.  Hey, Emily, you have nothing to begin with.  Think about all the animals that you have just put in jeopardy because of your insane remarks.  Shame on you.  Have a sense of humor.  Get off the phone.  You couldn't even play along with the two of them.  Get off the phone.  Right.  Hey, Emily.  Emily.  Yes, baby.  You ever go to Comac Motor Inn?  Yes.  No.  Ew.  I hear there's a jungle room in there.  Yeah, really?  And she's the biggest baboon in there. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, wow.  I can't believe that's what your ass looks like.  Bunch of...  Hang up, Emily.  Go back to reform school.  All right, Marge.  Reform school?  What is this, our gang?  No.  Who are you talking to, Darla?  No.  All right, Marge, how much do you really weigh?  Be honest, Marge.  I told you.  135 pounds?  Yes.  No way.  Oh, wow.  You know what?  Emily says you're like a melted snow cone, did she say? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  All right, listen.  Yeah, okay, Marge.  This is getting ridiculous.  It has gotten ridiculous.  It has gotten out of hand.  Yes, it has.  Emily?  Hang up, Emily.  Wow, relax, man.  Emily's one of our fine listeners.  You don't run the show, Marge.  Emily's selling out Marge, and Marge is getting a little PO'd at it because...  Okay.  Because the little shelter is a great organization, and there are the occasional hotties that do volunteer there.  All right, Emily, you get the final word.  But what do you got on Marge?  Why? 
[01:08:30]  Don't get as much money as you can to that place.  There you go.  All right.  Don't do it because of what Marge is doing.  Yeah, I got to say, Marge, how long has Little Shelter been in existence?  18 years.  Forever.  18 years?  Well, it's been...  You're lying.  No, no.  The actual organization, 80 years.  80 years.  And right now, you're running out of food.  Wait a minute.  And when Marianne took it over 18 years ago, it was a kill shelter.  They were putting animals to sleep for no reason. 
[01:09:00]  Kill.  Kill.  Kill.  Kill shelter.  And they came in and came in and came in.  Little Auschwitz.  The whole organization around, and it is the most admired non-kill shelter in New York.  Non-kill equals no fun.  You know what?  I'm going to have to take a tranquilizer after this.  Could you take a whole bottle and swig down some jack with it?  No.  It's going to be a whole different level because she's reeling a whole other level about what  goes on there with that ketamine and that tranquilizer.  Yeah.  You know what? 
[01:09:30]  I'm going to set up shop at the back door.  I want to see what's really going on.  Yeah, what's going on over there.  You can come in any time.  I want to see the pickup truck back up to the back door.  You know, guys.  As there's late night hold'em games going on because there's no money.  Right.  No.  Losing all the money playing poker.  Emily, we've got to let you go.  Okay.  Listen, thank you guys.  No, no.  Emily, we're going to.  Oh, get rid of Emily.  All right.  Thank you, Emily.  I got Nathaniel on the line.  I guess his aunt runs the actual shelter.  What?  Yeah, Nathaniel.  Hello, Marge. 
[01:10:00]  Who's Nathaniel?  He's on the line with you, Marge.  I never heard of him.  Why are you lying?  My aunt runs the shelter.  Why are you saying they're in a food crisis?  We're not in a food crisis.  Everybody knows that.  We had a little problem, but the training was program is fine.  You know this.  Why are you saying this?  Nathaniel, you are a rat.  It's the truth, Marge.  It's the truth, Marge.  Why are you trying to get more money to the shelter?  We already got it.  The truth is, the truth is, the truth is, Marge wears the same panties as Marge's father in 
[01:10:30]  Marge's father.  Tell this fat pig to stop eating all the puppy food.  Marge's father is a mafia front.  Jeff, what have you given me?  Marge's panties smell like dead puppy carcasses.  You have given me such a headache this morning. 
[01:11:00]  You cannot possibly imagine.  I love Marge.  All right, listen.  We have to take a break.  Can I get off now?  Yeah, well.  Well, if you got that vibrator, I'm sure you can.  What do you got?  What do you use in your lonely at night there, Marge?  Anything?  Who said I'm lonely?  A convulsing puppy.  Who said?  You know, you guys are making all kinds of conversations.  Awful jokes.  Marge, you got ten seconds before I hang up.  What's the big plug?  Give the big sell.  Little Shelter needs food. 
[01:11:30]  Go to our website, littleshelter.com.  Come and drop the food off at Little Shelter.  We are on 30.  Ten seconds.  Somewhere on Warner Road out there in Elwood.  All right, we got to take a break.  When we get back, finally, unless we're distracted again,  we got some highlights from Bill Burr taking on Philly on stage  at the Twitter Center from this past Saturday night.  The video is up on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search, but we'll give you a little taste. 
[01:12:00]  Unfortunately, on this side of the show, it's going to be heavily bleeped.  On the other side of the show, we'll play it unedited.  That's what we do.  Entirely.  In its entirety.  That's what we do later today.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Call the Opie and Anthony show right now.  866-313-FREE.  ONA, who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So, why'd you call?  The Lummy. 
[01:12:30]  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony show  at 866-313-FREE.  Hello?  The Opie and Anthony show.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Let's not forget, we have our last ONA traveling virus show happening in Cleveland, September 23rd. 
[01:13:00]  Last one of this year.  Yeah, a week from Saturday.  We added Otto and George.  What else do we know about, Jimmy?  I don't have the info on that.  Otto and George has been added.  It's myself, it's Patrice O'Neill, of course, it's Bill Burr, and Bob Kelly.  I think we're working on one more person.  Of course, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, tickets are available through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is up on OpieandAnthony.com.  It's a much smaller venue than we're used to doing.  Because Cleveland gets so cold so fast.  I think we had to take whatever venue we had. 
[01:13:30]  It's only like 4,000 seats of this one.  Tower City Empathy Theater.  Is that indoors or outdoors?  Indoors.  It is indoors, right?  I hope so.  It's already getting a little chilly this morning.  People are road tripping from New York.  I suggest the people listening to us in Buffalo.  It's not that bad of a ride.  Yeah.  These shows are becoming legendary.  Before you get snowed in, Buffalo.  Between the village and between the tailgating and what's going on on the stage.  Yeah, it's quite an adventure. 
[01:14:00]  Definitely.  And I think we're going to broadcast live from Cleveland a week from this Friday.  And then the show on the 23rd.  And that leads us into what happened in Camden, New Jersey this past Saturday with Bill Burr.  Stuff of legend.  It really is.  I suggest you go to YouTube and check out the entire performance of him just taking on the entire crowd. 
[01:14:30]  But we have some highlights here.  A little booing going on.  There were a couple of little boers out in the crowd.  Yeah, we should set this up again just in case people weren't listening yesterday there, Jimmy.  What was the vibe?  I mean, what was going on?  It was getting rough.  They booed Jimmy Schubert early.  I mean, again, Philly is notoriously rough.  And then Tracy got them back.  And, you know, the show was going well, but Philly crowds were always on the verge. 
[01:15:00]  They were right on the brink at any minute.  And the second half of the show started, Bobby Kelly went out and just kicked ass.  Boss killed.  Everybody, for the most part, killed.  Jimmy Schubert was destroyed.  I'm going to give Drew Boogie some props.  He did a great job as a DJ, man.  He held it together.  I mean, believe me, that's a lot more important than people realize to keep the music going,  keep people happy with what they're listening to.  And then Bobby Kelly kills.  Dom Murray goes out.  He's doing well.  And then he loses them a little bit. 
[01:15:30]  They boo him a little bit, which was really weird to see a rare get booed.  He's such a good comic.  I know, and a legend.  But it was late.  And, again, these psychos have been drinking since 11 a.m.  So, I mean, they're getting a little rowdy.  They booed him a little bit, but he handled it.  He handled it better than Schubert did because Schubert, I think, just, like, went on autopilot.  Whereas Dom kind of, I think, addressed it a little bit or slowly.  Whatever he did, he made it work, and he left.  Billy Berry comes on.  And from what I saw, Bill's first bit or something didn't work, which happens a lot to us as comics. 
[01:16:00]  You know what I mean?  You just come on, and your bit doesn't hit.  It's no big deal.  You want to open strong, though, don't you?  Yeah, but you do.  But, again, Billy is in a position on the show where everybody knows him and likes him, and he's really funny.  So, he doesn't have to prove himself.  It's like, if you're bombing for 10 minutes, they're going to give you a hard time.  Right.  But one bit, they'll usually be, yeah, no big deal.  But I think Bill got annoyed at them because they booed Herrera and said something to them about it.  I was watching this on the monitor.  And then they started booing him.  Started booing Bill.  Oh.  And it got really loud.  And I'm like, are they booing, Burr?  And then I just heard him snap. 
[01:16:30]  And he had a moment of clarity.  Yep.  He was going to go down and bomb horribly, or he was going to attack back.  And he attacked back.  He knew.  In a lovely fashion.  He had time backstage to say to himself, look, if this happens to me out there, I know how I'm going.  I know what direction I'm taking.  He was a third guy.  So, he threw his act away.  Yep.  And then just improv for like 12 minutes and just beat up Philly.  Slammed him.  Everyone is talking about this.  Yes.  Everybody is talking about this performance.  So, Tham, what's the first clip? 
[01:17:00]  Him getting into the rant?  Yeah.  That's when the wheels start.  Well, the wheels don't come off, I guess, because he killed.  But, yeah, it's just him.  It's none of his actual, like, normal bits.  Right.  It's just the start of when he starts losing it.  Okay.  So, yeah.  The setup, basically.  He did his act.  He started doing his act.  The booing started.  And he said, you know what?  Screw you all.  And this is what started to happen.  You don't stop talking, do you?  Like, ah, f*** it.  I'll just cook this side for a while. 
[01:17:30]  You know what's funny?  I'm cooking my brain talking about nothing.  I am.  I'm just walking around like, yeah, I just got a cheeseburger.  Oh, f*** all you people.  You know what?  You f*** losers.  I hope you all f*** die.  And I hope the f*** she don't never win the Super Bowl.  The f*** that.  I'm going to do f*** you.  And f*** the players.  F*** all you.  Some goddamn f*** losers. 
[01:18:00]  Who's done in my era.  F*** the f*** all you.  Oh, f***.  Stop that.  No.  I'm segueing into my next joke.  Get all the f*** my f*** red f*** all you.  You can line up in your Harold Carmichael f*** jersey.  And one at a time, you can all f*** my f***.  Oh, my God.  How many beefs are in that?  Was that the beginning of the tirade right there?  Oh, yeah.  It's funny. 
[01:18:30]  You could see Bill with the line about the cheeseburger.  As a comic, you could see right there, he's really floundering internally going, all right.  That was his moment of truth.  Like, I'm going to try to just turn this around with this.  And then they gave him a little hard time.  That was him standing at the crossroad right there.  It was like, all right, do I continue with the cheeseburger joke?  Just talking.  I think he felt, again, like you said, the wheel's coming off.  He was trying to steer.  All right, let me get back off the shoulder here.  And then he just kind of scroll up his wheel rolling in front of the car. 
[01:19:00]  And he just aimed for the children.  Is this worth playing with all the beeps?  I think it's at least play a couple of clips.  I think it's funny with the beeps to just show how vicious it was.  It is funny with the beeps.  Please play a little.  It took me over two hours to do.  No problem.  But the people listening on XM, don't worry.  Later on this morning, we're going to play the whole thing in entirety without the beeps.  No bitching.  You'll have to hear a couple of commercials.  But aside from that, we'll play it for you.  No bitching.  Bill's thing is sponsored by Bud. 
[01:19:30]  And for the people that don't have XM, just go to YouTube and throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  And you'll get to see this for yourself as well.  Or edit it.  Or get XM.  Or get it.  You shithlers.  How about you throw that out there as an option?  No.  You've got to balance the two here.  Don't you get what's going on?  Well, he means today, too.  If you push XM too much, then the people down the hall here get pissed off.  Oh, I know.  And if you don't push XM enough, then XM down there in Washington gets pissed.  It's a balancing act.  We're like spinning plates here.  I'm looking at poor Elo's face over here on Pal Talk. 
[01:20:00]  And, you know, I just figured, hey, there's an option perhaps.  Do you think I was saying it without saying it?  That's how smart I am.  I was keeping everybody happy.  I don't like his creepy goatee.  It hasn't grown in yet.  I don't care.  He looks Puerto Rican and I don't like it.  All right, here's some more.  Bill Burr takes on Philly on stage at the Tweeter Center.  This is where he gets into the whole cancer thing.  Harold Carmichael jerseys, by the way, made me really happy. 
[01:20:30]  That ain't going to work.  What do you want me to talk about?  I'm saying throw out some pockets.  Let's talk about heart disease.  You're all going to die of.  And I'm going to laugh at your futiles.  It's going to be great. 
[01:21:00]  You're all going to get cancer, which is fantastic because all your heads are shaved anyway.  No one's even going to notice.  You're going to get fired for coming to work too late.  Because then I'm going to notice that you have bone marrow cancer.  The only thing that's going to give it away is me laughing at you in the background.  You bunch of losers with your cell phone issues.  And then he starts counting down how many more minutes he has. 
[01:21:30]  It's like when Dom started getting booed, he cut his set.  Bill's like, not only, I'm not cutting my set.  I'm doing it every single minute I was supposed to do it.  He's counting down every minute he's doing.  That takes balls.  Is it worth playing?  We'll continue.  I just love hearing the beeps, actually.  At the end there, I don't even know what he was saying.  It was just beep, beep, beep.  Well, then he got into the Ben Franklin Bridge down there in Philly.  I hope you all get in your fourth focuses. 
[01:22:00]  Drive off the side of that faggot-ass Ben Franklin bridge.  You ****.  One bridge having.  He's **** in the city that no one gives a **** about.  The terrorists.  The terrorists will never bomb you people because you're **** worthless and no one cares about you.  You are this high above New Orleans.  People will never show up for you ****.  I hope your mother has herpes and the center of her ****. 
[01:22:30]  If you go home tonight, **** is getting on your ****.  If some other **** happens, it involves cancer.  We love all of you.  Eleven minutes left.  Eleven minutes.  Oh, did he go on?  You're one step above New Orleans.  No one cares about you.  No one cares about you.  Oh, wow.  Should we go on?  I can't get enough of this now.  Let me say at least one more.  You have to.  You have to. 
[01:23:00]  Then he goes after Rocky and the Eagles.  That was great.  Oh, you ****.  Rocky is your hero.  The whole crowd of your city builds around a **** guy who doesn't even exist.  You got ****.  Joe Frazier is from there, but he's black, so you can't **** deal with him.  So you make a **** statue for some three-foot ****.  You stupid.  You're feeling cheesy.  **** jackasses.  I hope that cheese melts your **** faces off.  All of you collectively **** off. 
[01:23:30]  **** **** **** **** **** ****.  Nine hours into a **** show.  You and your **** Donovan McNabb shirt.  I hope you snap all this **** ankles.  It's the first goddamn game.  I hope you go all in **** 16.  I say **** ****.  **** ****.  Eight minutes left.  this is one for the ages wow one for the ages oh my god started getting some huge laughs 
[01:24:00]  until he went after the eagles and then the booing got louder the cheese melts on your face  like he was just throwing every icon every philly icon at him that cheese steak you know  but that cheese melts all over your face you want more oh yeah all right here he uh goes after the  phillies  the phillies that faggot ass team hanged after a female horse you want your pussy you want one

[01:36:30]  it's the circle of life  everyone's  saying drugs  here's  or something  here's the story  we say with a smile  good morning Steve and Laurie  but I have to tell you  this first lady  that we're going to talk about  has been the object  of a lot of jokes  but these are  tough days  for Anna Nicole Smith  her only son  passed away  shortly after  her first daughter  was born  to the model  and TV personality  Daniel Wayne Smith  died in the Bahamas  at a hospital  where he traveled  to visit his mother  following the birth  of her baby girl 
[01:37:00]  the cause of his death  at the age of 20  is not yet known  but it looks like  drugs and alcohol  were not a factor  Anna Nicole is  absolutely devastated  said a statement  on her website  it's just horrible  yeah  suppose he was  sitting in a chair  and then he was  just dead  yeah  they're saying  yeah she thought  he was sleeping  went to shake him  and then called  the doctors in  what kind of doctors  you get down there  in the Bahamas though 
[01:37:30]  yeah some guy  with a flowered shirt  yeah  shorts  open toed shoes  waving chicken feet  at him  that's uh  he has offended  the spirit  oh  okay  yeah  so uh  oof  little bittersweet  thing going on there  huh  well yeah  it's gotta be a happy  birthday for the daughter  every year  oh my god  yeah happy  oh yeah  happy birthday  to you  on the same day  my son died  and her birth 
[01:38:00]  the kid's birthday  will always be marred  by that  yeah  thanks  she turns to the right  I'm happy  I'm happy  turns to the left  I'm sad  I'm sad  I'm happy  I'm sad  I'm happy  I'm happy  I'm happy  I'm sad  I'm sad  yeah there she is  on WB  they're showing pictures  of her  she uh  I don't think she did  a very good job  of um  being a mom  a role model  or something  it's my personal opinion  I think she kind of  showed uh  drugs and alcohol  as being something  uh good  for the kids 
[01:38:30]  maybe that came into play  maybe it's some kind  of genetic thing  who knows  well they don't think  drugs and alcohol  are a factor  maybe you had a brain  on yours  something like that  or meningitis  that's a bad one  I guess more info  will come out  I don't know  why am I speculating  like I'm a doctor  I'm a high school dropout  getting the heebie-jeebies  thinking about it  and I just went from nowhere  to maybe he had meningitis  you know what  a hand should appear  from nowhere  and cup slapped my mouth  you diagnosed him  from thousands of miles away 
[01:39:00]  with no knowledge  with absolutely no knowledge  whatsoever  well perhaps  it was subdural hematoma  I should have my throat  stepped on  Dr. S  you are Dr. S  no facts  none  none at all  nothing to base it on  the experts that were there  said they don't know  but Jimmy Norton  perhaps he hung himself  because he thought  he was E-Rock  that has as much credence  as anything else  I've said  make more sense  oh why would he be 
[01:39:30]  in the studio  during the show  why would he  just speak now  can you hand me  his fruit please  throw it away please  no no no  I'm not going to throw it away  I actually want a piece of it  I thought you were going  to lay something on it  no no no  give it the old  teabag treatment  why would I do that  just because you want to talk to somebody  and he's not in the studio  well  it looks delicious  oh Jesus  now place it back up there  he'll eat it anyway  no  did it open  yeah  oh no  I don't know  what's wrong E-Rock  where'd you go 
[01:40:00]  went to get some  what'd he go to get  something to drink  no he's got two sips left in it  oh  went to the bathroom  alright sorry  what's in your awful beverage container  iced tea  ew  would you make it  yeah  ew  what do you have  a crystal delight at home  would you bring in a little bit of iced tea  and put it in the water bottle  we don't want to see it  you can explain it  it's radio  I can't see it  Lipton's iced tea  oh  that's gonna suffer the same fate  have a man's drink 
[01:40:30]  why don't you  alright  by the way  you can tell 9-11 is  is behind us now  because  because the news are doing all the wacky stories today  they got  naked cowboy  after record deal  I hate naked cowboy  I hate him  we had him on the show once  ugh  just a big creep in tights  like underpants  yeah for the people that  don't know  he's a tourist attraction  here in  Times Square  in Manhattan  he 
[01:41:00]  they call him the naked cowboy  he calls himself that  but he's not naked  he wears  tighty whities  but he's gotta wear like  five pairs of them  he wears  superhero  underpants  yeah  why five pairs  because they  actually  he was wearing one pair of underwear  and they told him that  it was showing too much  because I guess  you know  in the front area  you could see an outline  and what not  so they made him put on a bunch of pairs of underwear  so that's what he does now  and then  on the  the back side of his underwear 
[01:41:30]  it says  the naked cowboy  wears a cowboy hat  and nothing else  and plays guitar  and plays like songs  and people  have their picture taken with him  these rubes  come to New York  have their picture taken  farmers  they come in  and yeah  that's it  I want to put Big A  across the street  in a pair of underwear  and call him  the naked fatso  the naked mess  or just the naked cow  there you go 
[01:42:00]  oh wow  you're on to something  that's a good one  you're on to something  or maybe instead of like  maybe instead of a guitar  you give him like  an accordion  or some other  the lamest instrument  a flutophone  tambourine  a tambourine  a naked tambourine  a triangle  a triangle  yeah we'll figure it out  we're on to something  the naked cow  excuse me  I would like coffee  from somebody  excuse me  could you 
[01:42:30]  could you  could you morph into a bat  and fly to Starbucks  Nosferatu  intern  yeah well here's the story  on the naked cowboy  it's one of the big stories  today  yesterday was about  the five year anniversary  of 9-11  today it's going to be  the naked cowboy  what happened in 24 hours  most famous street performer  working on a debut album  Joe do you love this guy  remember when we were  hanging out with him  in times square one day  naked cowboy  yeah gotta love the underwear  right  says it's part of his plan  for quote  dominating the commercial  landscape of the world 
[01:43:00]  he hasn't hooked up  with a record label yet  but hopes to release  a disc next year  the cowboy  whose real name  is Robert John Burke  I'm sorry  it's hard to read  but anyhow  says it's a little bit  country  a little bit rock and roll  stay focused Lucy  she's all turned on  is that what she was  getting at  I don't know what that means  he has a disc  coming out next year  he's been the naked cowboy  for eight years  and nobody wants to  put out his nonsense  no  and did they say  he doesn't have a record deal  did I hear that  he doesn't have a record deal 
[01:43:30]  but he's putting out  a disc next year  he's touring with Foundry  Steve Carr  yes  I was  the naked cross dresser  more success touring  with John Carr  Stephen Mark Carr  John Manet  hey  let's go to Chris  in Texas  Chris  what's the big nose  hey Chris  hey man  hey  what about  incorporating  the naked 
[01:44:00]  Big A  and his news stories  naked Big A  on the street  well you have to have  something on him  only because it wouldn't  be able to go on YouTube  but yeah I would love  to see him shirtless  well it would be  underwear again  much like the naked cowboy  or make it  no he usually make  Big A wear  you make him wear  like a little silky  slinky negligee  something really  like that would be sexy  on any other living creature  well I was thinking  more like  tighty-way use  or something like that  that's fine  well that's what  the naked cowboy wears 
[01:44:30]  tighty-whities  but like I said  he's got to wear  five of them  and then they're  now we should just  blow up  a naked cowboy's gig  every day we have  just another  naked theme  that takes all  the tourists  away from them  yeah  I saw  outside  well you  tell the story  I was gonna  yeah but obviously  you're a mind reader  and you knew  what I was gonna say  so you tell it better  go ahead  we're changing  the bumper stickers  as we speak  go ahead 
[01:45:00]  you know more about it  that's right  scratch out  scratch out  look  that's right  instead of wow  it's IW  interrupt Wednesday  go right ahead fella  go ahead  floor is yours  hope you and Chris show  no no go ahead  y'all  you sound like  you don't  why  obviously you had  something more important  to say  stepping all over me  go ahead  what were you gonna say  the pit's over  now if the player  would you have to say  go ahead  punch it out  oh god  damn it  love that pit  you also shouldn't  give up so easily  yeah  that's Malcolm X  let's saw the 
[01:45:30]  naked cowboy on  well why don't you  just  I saw him  across from the  Javits Center  did you  in my car  I did  and he was with  his girl  who is the  naked cowgirl  is she  and she wears  yeah she's got to  do the same thing  wear like bloomers  and broads  yeah pretty hot  and she plays guitar  does the same act  as he does  but they were leaving  they were done  for the day  done working  and they go to  their car  have a pretty nice car  open it up 
[01:46:00]  and they got clothes  in the back  they get dressed  and drive away  like you'd never know  he takes his hat  puts it in the trunk  dressed like just some  you know  couple  out on the town  and that's his gig  and you know how much  money he must make  I hear his boots  if you want to rob  the guy  his boots  is where he keeps  all the cash  he shoves money  down his boots  does he have to give  any to the city  oh taxes  perhaps the IRS  ought to look into  the naked cowboys  how much could he make 
[01:46:30]  though  I mean  tourists give him  a few bucks  but he's basically  just a stupid  homeless guy  with a guitar  the guy is obviously  not homeless  no he's not  not from the car  I saw him jump in  with his girl  and that's cash business  cash  and he's got to make  even on a bad day  a couple of hundred  a day  just strolling around there  Taco Bell  Doug  from Whack Bag  you could call  Big A  the naked cabbie  oh he is a cab driver  can we set up 
[01:47:00]  can we set up  Big A  in Times Square  let's do that  him in his underpants  can we make him wear  an old cabbie hat  like the one  Ernest Borgnine hat on  in Escape from New York  the old time one  oldie time  checkered  let's get Big A  on the phone  if we can  I want to see  if he's up for this  that would be fun  take business away  and he's just got to  stay a certain distance  from the naked cowboy  so if the naked cowboy  tries to get away from him  to distance himself 
[01:47:30]  he's got to follow him  around a little bit  try to hone in  on his crowd  we have to write something  on the back of his underpants  wash me  in the dirt  that's pretty funny  in brown  let's go over the top  let's spell it  wash me  yeah  alright listen  obviously 9-11  is behind us  because the news  is just  all about other stories  now today  P. Diddy 
[01:48:00]  must change his name  in the UK  why?  because I guess  there's another  Diddy  in the UK  that's like  WWF  well it's a good thing  they don't challenge  the views of Muslims  but let's go after  P. Diddy's name  boy England has  a priority straight  this is big news  stupid country  yesterday it was  all about sorrow  and remembering 9-11  today it's about this  catching blame  for his newest name  legal settlement  forces Sean P. Diddy  Combs to change his name  while in the UK  only  the hip hop star 
[01:48:30]  was sued by  British music producer  known as  Richard Diddy Dearlove  the producer claimed  that since Combs  started going by Diddy  people started getting  him confused  with the hip hop star  Combs says  that he doesn't mind  rebranding his work  in Britain  he says that he is  blessed to have  many other names  to choose from  he don't care  as long as the money  rolls in  just keeps him  in the headlines  by the way  I'm changing my name  yeah  P. Jimmy  no  that was your name  your hobby  whatever else you want 
[01:49:00]  to call it  it's life  what's uh  what are you changing  Mer  Star Wars  that's gonna be  your name now  yeah  Mer  Mer  Mer  I wouldn't even know  how to spell that  because it gets louder  at the  how do you spell  it being louder  expansion points  no yeah  the letters  they start off  lowercase  Mer  M  M 
[01:49:30]  M  M  M  M U  M U  H  H  H  H  H  underscore R  this is a  underscore R  one more time  M  no say it  no your name  oh  you're gonna mess it up  now  you don't remember  Mer  alrighty got it  you screwed it up  a little bit  I thought the Mer  was longer  no it wasn't  I had to say my own name  there's only one M  there's only one M  no no no 
[01:50:00]  there's three M's  it's the old Dutch version  oh okay  let's go to Fuzzy  in Connecticut  Fuzzy  new name stinks  it's very  it's catchy  it is not  what  yes sir  Norton  yes sir  what the F  is Crystal Delight  I know  it's Crystal Light  you said Crystal Delight  I'm a dope  what do I know  about that  faggity drink  I'm sorry  I caught myself after  but I was like  who cares  who am I  Linda Evans  well Jimmy  I care 
[01:50:30]  thank you sir  alright man  I was thinking  of Sunny D  I used to like  the Sunny Delight  commercials  where the black  Asian and white  friends had all  played basketball  yes  and they were all  out in the white  boys home  which I didn't  care for  and they all  poked their  multicultural heads  into the fridge  and asked for  some Sunny D  and while they  were having it  the black kid  would rifle through  mom's wallet  and purse  yo bitch  where the Sunny D  at  because he was  17  playing with her  9 year old 
[01:51:00]  we don't have  any Sunny D  they really did  want that to be  a multicultural  drink  yeah look  my black friend  my Asian friend  and me  all having  a little  Sunny D  mother  we played  a little  basketball  there was  no racial  advantages  now we'll all  have some  Sunny Delight  and they all  call it by  their nickname  yo where's  the Sunny D  you want  some Sunny D  kids  here's how 
[01:51:30]  it would be  hey white boy  get me a drink  yeah  do you want  some Sunny D  just get me  something to drink  whatever  let's go to  Rob in New York  Rob  hey what's up  Sunny D  hey  I'd rather  drink AIDS  Liz I thought  you guys  just might  find it  funny  you're probably  incorrect  I probably  wouldn't  you're right  I'm sorry  the naked  cowboy  actually makes  his money  for motivational  speaking  and television 
[01:52:00]  appearances  ew  where the hell  is he  motivationally  speaking  who finds  him  inspirational  I swear  I swear  to you  I kid you  not  I heard  him on  an interview  I think  it was  on like  channel 11  a few  years back  or whatever  and you know  because he  he's making  his money  living his  dream  playing music  and he goes  to schools  and stuff  like that  it is the  funniest thing  I've ever  I believe  when I heard it  if you're  motivated by him  you should just  be executed  well I wasn't 
[01:52:30]  doing much  in my life  and then this  guy came in  who stands  in the street  in his underpants  he has no  record deal  and he just  plays guitar  for strangers  for a dollar  he's a beggar  pretty much  he is a beggar  exactly  and that's  motivational  to people  alright  it's called  being a bum  Jules  hope the naked  cowboy has  hot motor oil  splashed on his  back  we're gonna break

[01:58:30]  will they  release  sometimes part  of it only  on itunes  and like to get  the whole thing  you have to go to  the store  yeah  okay so that's not  the band's fault  now our friend  john mayer  who's a friend  of the show  he had a great  single  waiting on the  world to change  and I think  his album  comes out today  I don't know  what it's called  Roland  I think it's  something like  Continuum  or something  okay  it's Continuum  he said  Conundrum  before  oh really  yeah like  what's it  called  Conundrum  well you know  it's great  that john mayer  has an album  coming out  and stuff  today  but the big  news is  the Star Wars 
[01:59:00]  thing that  Anthony's been  obsessing about  all freaking  day  I need  my copies  of Star Wars  if you go  best buy  you get  special disc  what kind  of special  disc  oh no it's a  bonus two disc  only at best buy  if you buy it  there  you get like  the original  of the movie  you get the  movie then get  two bonus discs  that Lucas  what's on the  bonus discs  it didn't say  it's a best buy  exclusive  because it says  that the  like if you  buy it anywhere  you get the 
[01:59:30]  original theatrical  version  and you also  get the  you know  the one with  the extras  you get that  the one with  the you know  the version where  they put in  the digital  crap  and you know  that garbage  and uh  then you get  like a disc  with um  behind the  scenes stuff  and uh  outtakes and  interviews and  stuff  so what could  possibly be on  the best buy  I'm not sure  they said  exclusive that  Lucas did  exclusive that  Lucas did  maybe it's 
[02:00:00]  video of him  taking a crap  he has sold  everything else  every possible  way he could  sell Star Wars  a piece of  original Ewok  fur  now here's a  DVD of  making uh  duty  or he should  have just  called preparing  for my next  film  because that's  what he's been  putting out for  the last few  years  hey Jason  think I dropped  a log in front  of a blue  screen  this was then  composited over  a toilet bowl  picture 
[02:00:30]  hey and do you  have somebody  going to get  one of the  store opens  yes  have you given  the money yet  no I haven't  given anybody  money yet  but I'm  waiting  hey I was  thinking about  um  the Steve  Colbert thing  we were talking  about  the Steve  Colbert thing  is great  and I want to  take it to the  next level I  decided  okay  you want to  explain what  he's doing  Stephen Colbert  has uh  has a contest  running on his  show the Colbert  Report which is on  after the daily  show on Comedy  Central I find it  ten times funnier 
[02:01:00]  than the daily  show I think he's  a great host  very quick witted  very funny  very sarcastic  smarmy uh  and he's doing  this uh  contest he filmed  himself  in front of a  green screen  with a stick  kind of like  Star Wars kid  sure uh  and he's he's  like waving it  around like a  lightsaber and  doing some bad  like rolls  and he gets up  and and takes a  few swipes at  nothing because  it's green screen  and the contest  is uh for the 
[02:01:30]  people to take  his footage off  of his website  and uh take  him out of it  it's easy to do  with the green  screen backing  and put him in  certain situations  where the  lightsaber is  appropriate  uh and  some of them  are really  hysterical  and some of  them done  very well  there's one  of him fighting  a rancor  that is just  amazingly done  and then there's  other ones that  are kind of silly  and some that  are really badly  done  but uh  very very good  idea  very funny  and um  he plays those  clips every night  can we um 
[02:02:00]  do something  similar  i was completely  thinking of ripping  off the idea  completely giving  him credit  like saying  look we're  stealing this  idea from  stephen colbert  i want to do  it with  poo  with  poo  now how would  you do that  well we'd have  to uh you  know  green screen  yes  you might find  this really weird  yeah  i i have a  green screen 
[02:02:30]  what  i have  the potential  to do green  screening  at my house  what a creep  i know  i'm a creep  ew  what do you do  green screen  walking through a  park and being  normal  i was very bored  for a couple of  years and got  into digital video  uh of photography  and part of it  was green screening  and i had fun  with it and it's  it's just it's a  it's a fun thing  to be creative  with  i have by the  way i would  also like to  steal stephen  colbert's idea  and what i would 
[02:03:00]  like to do is  green screen myself  semi-nude  doing questionable  things and have  myself dubbed  into pornography  really  okay  yeah  that could be  done  oh i think  i'd be happy to  be on my hands  and knees  just looking back  over my shoulder  pushing  now that would  be funny  maybe  a slinky outfit  so you could  bring in your  green screen  uh  yeah  could bring it  in  tap it 
[02:03:30]  the thing is  it's all in the  lighting so to  move it  it would be  better for jimmy  to come to my  house  can we do it  at your house  yeah  okay  wow you'll be  the first person  at his house  yeah no  you can come  over opie  i bet you  blindfolds you  meet you  somewhere  in a burger  king and  blindfolds you  and then drives  you into the  garage  i don't want  anybody to  know where  it is  but will it  actually come  out looking  like do i  need to go  to a professional  green screen  or no  this  no this  would be fine  for you know  what we're  what we're doing  i can't be totally  nude i'll just  have to wear like  silky 
[02:04:00]  i don't want  you totally  nude in my  basement with  me taping you  that's a little  creepy  that's creepier  than having a  green screen  yeah  i think we  can have fun  with that  yeah  this leads to  our latest  contest  no i'm not  green screening  myself into  nazi propaganda  films  bastards  yes  it's uh  our wonderful  wonderful macbook  promotion that  we're doing here  send us your 
[02:04:30]  30 seconds or  less production  piece about the  opie and anthony  show and the  week of uh  october 2nd  we're going to  announce the best  five entries  submit your entry  at 923  fm  damn it  923  free fm  dot com  there's where  your entry goes  923  free fm  dot com  by september  29th  at 9 a.m  you could win  the new macbook  has everything you  need to explore  all your creative  possibilities  and uh  you can take it  with you wherever

[02:05:30]  lot of programs  during the time  we were off  i got adobe  after effects  and final cut  pro and  premiere  a lot  a lot  of these  great  video  digital  video  programs  and in  order to  learn how  to use  them  you have  to use  them  and one  of the  things that  was making  an authentic  looking lightsaber  thing  and not only  just to make  the lightsaber  it teaches  you certain  things that  you need to  know to  use the  program  so that's  why i 
[02:06:00]  did it  and it  kind of  looked cool  and then you  add sound  to it  you go to  like lucasfilm  and grab  some sound  and it  looked like  i was  swinging  around a  lightsaber  it was  pretty cool  then i  lost it  i'm going  to get  i'm not  going to  be again  nude  because my  gut  embarrasses  me  but i'm  going to  buy something  from victoria's  secret  i'm looking  forward to it  jim  perhaps  some type  of a teddy  to wear  to your  place  and be  green  screen  i'm going  to wear  a teddy  can we set  up a  green  screen  shoot 
[02:06:30]  in studio  maybe  someone out  there will  help us  out  it's hard  to get  the lighting  because the  lighting on  the green  screen  has to be  just a tad  darker than  the lighting  on the  subject  and you  can't have  the lighting  on the  subject  shadow  on the  green  screen  there can't  be any  shadows  on there  so it's  kind of  i understand  you know  i'll go to  your place  yeah we'll  work it out  you gotta  set up  so i'm  sure somebody  believe me  i'm sure  a listener  has the  same thing  and could  come down  and green  screen a  wall  and light  it  and everything  that'd  be great  fine if  you want  to do  that  kevin  from

[02:35:30]  she's about three feet tall  girl midget  little midget  saw her on the treadmill  reaching up to the little  control panel  trying to set her  setting  that's adorable  what'd she have it set on  .3 miles an hour  about  and her little chubby legs  are running faster  than could be  oh  with those kneecaps  that just like  shove out to the side  oh  yeah they were kind of  rubbing together too  but you couldn't even see her  she was so little  if you were facing  the treadmill 
[02:36:00]  you could only see her legs  you couldn't see her head  or anything else  why bother  I was just going to say that  she's always going to be squatty  matter of fact  I bet she doesn't do squats  because she's squatty  no kidding  a few minutes later  she was in the weight room area  where I was  and she picked up  no kidding  a three pound set  of dumbbells  I watched her  hop on an incline bench  and do a set of flies  then as God as my witness  she hopped off  and she did a set of squats 
[02:36:30]  I thought I was going to fall over that  squats  can't we start videotaping  these midget sightings  god there's phones everywhere  with video capability  just tape them  I'd love to put that up  if you're a midget in the gym  the only machine  you should work out on  is the stretch rack  to try to make your  rack  person height  oh  was she on the treadmill  wearing little cabbage patch  doll sneakers  yes as a matter of fact  she had on some  cute pink shorts  alright  cute pink shorts  thank you Tari  alright guys

[02:39:30]  how did your parents die  why not  how'd your parents die  why not  how'd your parents die  why not  how'd your parents die  why not  how'd your parents die  why not  how'd your parents die  oh  multi-faceted  oh my  you're like a  managerian candidate  oh is that horrible  if you saw a woman  miss Carrie  would you  A. help her  B. laugh  it is the same  why not  how'd your parents die  Why not?

[02:40:00]  There's no drama, no change of emotion, nothing.  That's great.  I want a lollipop.  The shuttle exploded.  I want a lollipop.  The shuttle exploded.  Who said he was enthusiastic?  I did.  Wow.  I know.  I wasn't trying to be sarcastic.  Or a brown nose.  I don't like his deep-set eyes.  He's talking to the mic.  I think Chris is the one that's had his own radio show, 
[02:40:30]  and we did ask him during his interview to bring in air checks.  Oh, you did?  So you got some air checks?  You're panicking right now.  Why?  Well, it's just nervous now.  Phones come off.  Pull the mic towards you.  It's like he's out there.  He's away from the mic.  The headphones were off.  It's back in.  The headphones are on.  That was a mean sarcastic.  My eyes are blue and deep-set.  Ah.  Wow.  That's rough.  These new guys are nervous, man.  Yeah.  Anything? 
[02:41:00]  Not really.  Just nervous beyond belief.  Are you?  Really?  Yeah.  Cool.  So what did you do on your own show?  Basically did, like, hysterical bits, like we...  Well, it's basically hysterical.  For example, like, one of our bits we did...  How about stopping with the adjectives?  We just did these really innovative, hysterical things.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  One of our bits we did was, like, hottest midget contest at our school.  Interesting.  I was just talking about that.  Like, midgets being hot.  And would you bang one?  Because we had a midget sighting.  And I always thought the midget from Total Recall. 
[02:41:30]  If you were going to fuck a midget, it would probably be her.  All right.  If you were going to fuck a midget, your name would be God.  Done.  So you did the hottest midget.  And one of our friends is actually an amateur comic, and he does...  No.  If you know the metal band System of a Down, he...  Yeah.  System of a Down fight, anything from nursery rhymes to Z100 crap.  It's pretty fun.  Wait, System of a Down?  Yeah.  I see what he's saying.  He System of a Down fight, what System of a Down would sound like if they did, like, 
[02:42:00]  Mary Had a Little Lamb.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  It sounds very boring, I know.  But it's pretty funny.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Did you get angry?  Get the fuck out, now.  Does he make any noises when he's angry? 
[02:42:30]  Grr, grr.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  Can you play my favorite?  Oh, Jesus.  It's actually E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  That's starting to take over the world.  Yeah, the E-Rock...  Are we done with this kid?  Well...  I don't know.  What is your radio show about?  Ah!  The cough at the end of the clincher.  Ooh, not as much granola today.  Wait, are those fattening up or no?  I don't know, I haven't figured it out yet.  Four grams of fat, 11 grains. 
[02:43:00]  It's gotta be fat.  11 grams of protein.  Only four grams of fat.  That's pretty good, right?  Yeah.  How many servings is that?  I don't know.  I don't know, mood killer.  Sorry.  Jesus.  How many servings?  Yes.  Three potato chips.  I hope he's very sensitive about his figure.  Yes.  I'm not.  You are.  And Jimmy's very sensitive about watching.  And Chris is looking around like, should I still be in here?  Should I leave?  Should I do something?  Well, I really don't want to do anything that'll piss any of you off, to be honest.  Well, he's very smart. 
[02:43:30]  He's been pretty good so far.  Yeah, he's been great.  He's a fresh, he's an aptly faced young man, trying to make good.  He's trying to make it in the biz.  He's trying to make it big.  So this is it.  This is like the internship, and then what happens?  How does the career go?  How do you see the career going?  You intern with us, you get done, and where do you go?  You get hired.  Who do you take over for?  Get hired from here?  Mm-hmm.  Hire every motherfucker that comes through this place?  No, we stopped hiring.  Jesus Christ.  I feel bad for the guys that are interning now.  We're like the United States. 
[02:44:00]  There was a time, full up, you went from intern to working on the show, and that ended.  Yeah.  Sam.  Sorry.  Sam was the last one.  Sam was the last one.  Yeah.  We were aced out by a real fucking gem.  Well, to be honest, the reason why I applied for the internship is because I'm a huge fan  of the show.  I know it sounds really pussy, but it's true.  How big a fan?  Do you go on the message boards and stuff?  No.  Not even.  Oh, you were told about that.  I mean, I read some things, but I don't post anything. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  What do you like about the Opie and Anthony show?  Good question.  Well, you guys have the balls to say anything that's on your mind, and you probably just  turned off my mic.  Let's say hi to Bill in Las Vegas.  Bill?  Hey, what's going on this morning?  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  I got a blowjob one time by a midget.  What was his name?  That old gig.  It was during a rock concert.  I was working for a band.  It was in a club in Lubbock, Texas.  She was a caterer.  She'd come in, and we got to talk and this and that.  What did she cater? 
[02:45:00]  Pigs in a blanket?  Or the little midget foods?  Anyway, we didn't quite line up.  Shrimp.  She's up to her hot dog.  She's eating a pig's in a blanket like it's a real hot dog.  A little nothing.  It's a foot long.  She's tackling a shrimp like it's a lobster.  I was like, go ahead.  You keep talking while we're improv-ing and having fun.  Go ahead.  Why not?  We had at least five more minutes.  Yeah, but we didn't mean like you'd actually jump in and try to be humorous.  But you talk about the midget blowjob.  We'll make it up on the back end.  No problem. 
[02:45:30]  We're that damn good.  Your turn, sir.  Go.  What happened with the midget blowjob?  So we didn't quite line up, so I had to stand up on one stair.  She stood flat-footed on the floor, and I was up on one stair.  That's kind of funny.  That's great.  You improvised, adapt, and overcame.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Good boy.  That's good.  Did she use those little fucking Vienna sausage fingers on your cock?  No, they were reaching around, grabbing my butt.  Ew.  So the midget hand was on your ass?  Did she use the other ones to try to cup your balls? 
[02:46:00]  No, no, no.  She's trying to jerk you off.  That rotten thumb is just dangling there like a fucking tail on a manx cad.  Stop it.  Non-existent little strip fingernails.  Well, whatever.  Go ahead.  I'm trying to describe her hand, but, you know, whatever.  You go ahead.  You're making me.  You go.  You go, sir.  It's all about you.  We're no one.  That's it.  Attaboy.  All right.  What were you saying, dude?  We didn't mean to cut you off.  Yeah.  Well, that guy actually did bring up a horrifying story about me, did get him a blowjob from a midget. 
[02:46:30]  Get his kissable lips.  No, I mean, she wasn't like, you know, a two-foot midget.  Horrible story about me getting him a blowjob from a midget.  It's nervous, man.  It's nervouses.  It's nervouses.  I'm very nervouses.  Wow.  You are really nervous.  Go ahead.  Tell your story.  Tell your story, motherfucker.  All right.  My girlfriend at the time was like four foot two.  Yeah.  And God, honestly, the best blowjob I've ever received. 
[02:47:00]  Really?  Yes.  But four foot two is not a midget.  It's a short girl.  Really, really short, but.  How tall are you?  Five nine, five ten.  See, the story is good if it's a real midget.  If it's just a short girl giving a blowjob, it's just you're bragging.  Do you ever have one of these, though?  You know?  You ever have one of these where you take a midget and you throw it on its back  and you grab the head and you fuck its mouth for a little while  and you keep banging up against the side of the bed because there's bars on it  and the mother walks in and goes, that's not a midget. 
[02:47:30]  That's a baby.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  Just ask him.  Can I ask a question?  No.  Can I ask a story?  Sorry.  I didn't mean to.  Apologize.  All right.  Can, uh, where's Club Soda Kenny?  Yeah.  He's getting food, unfortunately.  Yeah, why?  Well, it's been nice for him to throw Chris out.  Yeah, he's a good kid.  He has deep set eyes like Java, man.  I like this kid.  Java, man. 
[02:48:00]  Thank you.  He's a good boy.  Bring in, Keith.  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  I was from Patterson.  Now I live in Caldwell.  Jersey.  Jersey would have been.  I have a certain affection for Jersey boys.  Yeah.  Bet you do.  Mm-hmm.  Keith.  Look who's here.  Keith the cop.  Do what you have to do.  Sir, let's go, please.  Attaboy, Chris.  You did good.  You made it longer than Craig.  Wear a longer shirt next time.  Put a fucking sundress.  The room loves it.  Oh, the new crew is really nervous. 
[02:48:30]  The employees just love it.  All right.  Who else do we got besides Craig and Chris?  Yeah, any more?  We got Laszlo.  We're going to take a break.  Laszlo's a friend.  We're going to get Laszlo in.  Oh, you want to meet the rest of the guys?  Might as well.  There are more interns?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How many do we get?  We have things we need, Don.  Citrus.  Six or seven?  We got to acknowledge six or seven guys?  All right.  Oh, boy.  I love when I see someone that I haven't seen in a year, and they go, I used to intern,  and I go, I know.  I forgot you were alive.  He's shaking his head, like freaking out. 
[02:49:00]  Wow.  There you go.  Did you ever regret killing Nancy Spungen?  I don't know who that is.  I don't know who that is.  Tells you right off.  It's fucking Todd right there.  He's got a Johnny Cash shirt.  I kind of like that.  He's a slender boy.  Tats.  Quite slender.  Who picked you out?  Travis?  Ah, Steve.  Steve.  Of course.  Let me tell you.  Are you good with massage?  Production, right?  Is that what you want to get into?  I like production.  Production.  Fucking Steve.  Fucking guy.  Enough with the production.  Is that what you're saying?  Huh?  He hired slaves, is that what you're saying? 
[02:49:30]  Nah, he hired people that are going to be able to do his work.  Yeah, right.  Slaves.  Okay.  He hires guys that he's attracted to.  Ah, thanks.  I'm sexually attracted to all types.  And he mixes them in with like a Chris.  Chris is a bigger boy, a bit heavy.  Yeah.  Just to throw us off.  He doesn't want us to know what his type is.  We think it's you though.  Like, you're young.  You're probably, you don't have probably a lot of body hair.  You're tattooed.  You're like a rebel.  Steve like fantasized that you're going to come in and smack his head and go, suck it  old man.  Nah.  And your Jimmy Dean jeans, fucking cuffed at the bottom. 
[02:50:00]  I mean, that's probably what he thinks.  Ah, your tat work.  Yeah.  I like that.  It looks pretty old school.  Yeah.  Like the broad on there looks like maybe you did a stint in the military.  Sailor Jerry.  Yeah.  Wow.  Good call, Ant.  Where were you?  Ah, nah.  You weren't in the military?  You weren't in the military?  Nah.  But maybe you were Navy or something.  Nope.  They look like Navy tats.  Nah, that one is.  Yeah.  You're not in the Navy.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, what?  Someone you know in the Navy?  Ah, grandfather.  Great grandfather. 
[02:50:30]  All right.  How old are you?  29.  Jesus.  You look fucking much younger than a wonder.  Steve likes you.  So, it's a long story that you have Navy tats.  No, the anchor.  I literally got stood, screwed, and tattooed.  Oh, one of those deals.  And you thought...  Ah!  Thanks.  Ah!  Good.  So, Todd, you're 29.  That's a little old to be interning.  Yeah.  So, obviously, you were doing something else than you wanted to do radio?  Fucking around, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  What happened?  Would you clean up?  Ah, yeah, pretty much.  You sober or no? 
[02:51:00]  You drink a little?  Oh, I drank.  Okay.  Ah, I drank.  Got my shit together.  You going to connect to school broadcasting?  Oh, of course.  For what?  And what were...  Yo, production.  Production.  What were you doing before?  Uh...  What kind of jobs?  Mechanic?  Dental tech.  Dental tech?  That's the guy I'd want in my mouth with a fucking...  With a pick.  No, no, no, no.  It's not like a...  Oh.  I make the teeth.  Oh, Jesus.  Really?  Yeah.  Could you fucking talk to Rich Voss?  Jesus.  Needs teeth or what?  No, he needs a fucking reduction.  Holy shit.  He needs a tooth reduction. 
[02:51:30]  I know.  Right now, there's a fucking horse with tiny teeth going...  You must give me a mix-up in the mail.  Little chiclet teeth.  So the people bite into that shit, hold it in their mouth, make the mold.  Yeah.  You get it.  And then you've got to make teeth out of it?  Yeah.  I've got a porcelain paintbrush.  Wow.  Granite shit in.  How about that?  That sounds like something that...  No, it's fucking miserable.  But that sounds like something that can go, you know...  Maybe you become a dentist.  Nah.  No, you're too much school.  They've got like a high enough suicide rate.  I don't know.  Is that it?  Dentists?  Yeah.  Dentists, man.  Fuck you.  The highest. 
[02:52:00]  The highest.  Why?  Who the fuck wants to go see a dentist?  Because everyone hates seeing them, that's right?  Because they have to sit there and look at hot chicks on concerts and cancer their tits.  Why?  I think you get higher than cops.  I think it's just a depressing job, you're looking in the fucking gaping, stinking mouths  all day and...  Everybody hates you.  Everyone hates you.  No one wants to go see you.  You're just a harbinger of pain.  You fucking finger one chick while she's asleep, you'll lose your license.  That's it.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  There's not a lot of fucking grace period with that. 
[02:52:30]  They have a zero tolerance policy for drugging and raping one of your patients.  One time you do it, I think you're out.  It's not fair.  It's not fair.  Perhaps even more than that.  More than that, gentlemen.  So you married, kids?  Nah.  Fuck no.  No way.  We live.  I'm a speaker of Long Island.  Hey, there you go.  Okay.  I'll remember you, Long Island guy.  Long Island boy.  South Shore, but, you know.  You're going to really remember these guys?  This one I'll remember.  He looks like everyone they arrest for fucking highway shootings.  Lurking behind a bush with a rifle. 
[02:53:00]  Slender with big eyes.  He's just a guy, like, I've seen 8,000 of you in 8,000 bars on Long Island.  You're just like, you know, one of the bar guys.  Fucking white trash douchebag.  Yeah.  Join the club.  That's why I like this guy.  All right.  All right.  He's a good boy.  That's good.  All right, let's go.  You're late for your appointment at the Mets.  All right.  Let's go.  What?  What the fuck?  God, I don't enjoy the Mets hat, but that's okay.  It's New York.  Did Keith get nervous during that improv?  Yeah.  He did.  Oh, God damn. 
[02:53:30]  He worked that one out in his head, and it came out.  You're late for your appointment at the methadone clinic.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Out of the question.  I've noticed something happened with Keith.  What?  He's really nervous on the new shows.  Yeah?  Old days, he was pretty smooth, but something's going on with him.  What happened?  No.  I don't know.  I hear the old bits.  I sound confident.  Yeah.  Lost a little something.  Yeah.  You're late for the methadone, Carson.  We were looking for you there, Kenny, to throw some of the interns out. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Because you do it like it's funny and everything, you know.  Still riding off, kiddo.  Any more interns here today, or no?  That was the last one.  Please say no.  Oh, yeah.  Who else we got, Danny?  Jimmy, add the blueberries.  Oh, I've had so many blueberries.  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  Oh, boy.  Did you throw blueberries at Jimmy?  Jimmy, I didn't mean that.  That's all on my phone, my camera.  Who cares?  It's all on electronics.  Those are good with water.  Ken, I'll dab my lap. 
[02:54:30]  Thank you.  Oh, my dear.  Jesus.  I didn't mean that.  Oh.  I was trying to do something nice.  I threw the blueberries across the room.  There's an emergency in here.  Jimmy pissed his pants.  It bounced and took out your water.  Thank God it wasn't a coffee.  Yes.  Too late.  You all right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  That was bad.  Ken?  That's it for interns.  That's it?  Yeah.  We only had three?  Yeah, they rotate.  We'll try the blueberries anyway.  We'll meet the other ones, I guess, when they rotate.  They're right on top, though. 
[02:55:00]  Throw it right on top.  They're dirty.  It makes it nice.  What are they working on right now?  What do you make them do?  I don't even know the protocol.  We should have them bring in their material there.  Definitely.  Their material.  Bring in some tapes.  All right.  What, are they just gathering things?  They should be looking for material for the show at all times.  Shredding evidence?  What are they doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to take a break.  When we get back...  Laszlo.  We'll have Laszlo, yes.  Right.  And we also have Bill Burr, unedited.  Oh, I like it so much better with the beefs.  Yeah, right. 
[02:55:30]  What the hell is going on?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Too lowly long.  You're crying, sir.  Too lowly long.  Too lowly long.  Too lowly long.  Check this out.  The crap that make it.  This is wrong.  The crap that make it.  Try again, dumbass.  The crap that make it.  Push out.  I, P, D, I.  Well, go you.  Well, go you.  Well, go you.  Well, go you.  The other one's fun. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, yeah, big whoop.  No one cares.  Go F yourself.  Oh, man, this is so intense.  You suck.  Thank you very much.  Sucker.  Hey, shut up.  You're going to mean it.  Here you go.  I'm coming here.  That's a winner.  Check, please.  This bit's done.  Hey, this is Tom Morello.  This is Brad Wilk. 
[02:56:30]  And Tim C here.  Hey, this is Chris from Audioslave,  and you're listening to Opie and Anthony,  and they don't look like you think they do.  Trust me.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Wow.  In studio, Laszlo.  Hi, buddy.  I'm looking at a picture of some chick  bending all the way over  and spreading her cheeks  as far apart as she possibly can.  I do believe we'll be talking about this  in a little while.  She's gaping. 
[02:57:00]  Laszlo, you're doing a show Saturday night?  Saturday night.  9 to midnight Eastern.  Right here on 202.  Nice.  Very cool.  What do you want to start with today, Laszlo?  We've got GTA stuff.  What's going on with GTA?  Well, you know, you guys are bashing on Steve.  I actually had to direct Steve in the studio  because he does a voiceover  for the upcoming GTA Vice City Stories.  Ah.  Which I gave you a clip there  and it's also on the official website 
[02:57:30]  that launched last week.  But you'll find that there are several members  of the Jim Norton and Friends show  and some upcoming titles.  For me?  Yes.  Well, I noticed, um...  When can we start really talking about Laszlo?  It's going to be a couple of weeks.  We've got some things to say.  I noticed a few things popped up  on the Internet Movie Database  when we put various people's names in there.  Already?  Yeah.  Those are all just...  That's speculation.  Yeah, it's speculation.  It's completely... 
[02:58:00]  IMDB.  People think it's the word of God,  but it's not.  It's not.  Speculation.  It's not.  No, they have Jim Norton dead of age, so...  Do they really?  Yeah, they did for a while.  They do.  Speculating.  Well, how am I going to correct them?  Who cares?  It's a sure thing, anyway.  Yeah, because the first season  of Lucky Louie, he died of AIDS.  Rest in peace.  Yeah, it's basically just  the Hollywood Wikipedia, you know?  Anybody can just submit stuff on there.  Because Steve was like,  I'm really upset that I did not get my credit  for Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories  when I performed a voiceover.  I put a voiceover in...  That's Steve Serling? 
[02:58:30]  He almost had it.  It's close enough.  A man finds himself in a production room  with a humble, rotting pair.  I was trying to get him in the mood.  He's upset.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  He did a few characters,  one of which was...  Because we reviewed all these 1980s commercials,  and you realize how actually free the 80s were  to be sexist and completely over the top.  Do you remember those legs commercials 
[02:59:00]  with the...  Yeah, I remember.  It was a great pair of legs.  Mabel King was a spokesperson.  They would have, like, these ads  where there would be guys just lined up,  like they're ready to pull a train on a chick, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, honey.  Va-va-voom, cunt.  Cunt calls.  You know, and you have, like,  the designer jeans commercials  that were just...  The Jordache look.  Yeah.  I had a crush on the Gold Diggers jeans commercial.  Gold Diggers?  That's right.  Also known... 
[02:59:30]  Well, I'm excited on that one.  I was...  It was racist and awful.  When Jim holds back.  No, I remember the Gold Diggers.  It was Gold Diggers.  If anybody has that commercial,  it was a little blonde girl.  She was really cute,  and she was, like, doing some awful dance.  I remember that commercial.  Gold Diggers.  And that was all I can remember,  but I used to pretend that she was, like, my girlfriend.  Yeah.  And I would date to Gold Diggers.  Because wasn't she, like, a kid?  Yeah, yeah.  I was probably 13 or 14,  and she was probably, like, 12,  and she was in that age group, 
[03:00:00]  probably my age.  Now I still like her,  as she was then.  Yeah, please, get me the video.  Yeah, they had, like, you know,  fashion jeans commercials  that were so blatant about, you know,  your tight ass, and...  Yeah.  They've really toned down advertising.  All they show was the ass.  Yeah.  And we did one thing  when I had Steve in there,  and I was like,  Steve, you've got to act like you're angry.  You've got to act like...  He's like,  hold on a second,  I have to think about Opie.  He said that?  I'll bring the line in. 
[03:00:30]  Jesus.  Yep.  Yeah.  Wow.  I've got a bad rap at times,  I've got to tell you.  But, uh...  So here's the commercial he did?  Ew.  Yeah, he did one that's for Camu jeans,  but it's spelled C-A-M-U-S,  which is also a famous philosopher  that George Bush is currently reading.  Yeah, sure he is.  I love when they have those books,  like, what the president's reading.  The president is at his ranch  doing some reading.  Like he has time to read.  I just don't imagine  Bush reading about existentialism.  That's got his... 
[03:01:00]  Look at this.  Curious George is in trouble again.  We do a dopey radio show  and we don't have time to read.  Oh.  Reads.  All right, here's Steve  doing the commercial.  Ew.  In the upcoming GTA.  Here we go.  Vice City Stories.  We're acting.  Camu.  The line, the line forms in the rear.  Camu.  Camu.  The philosophy of denim.  The integrity of anatomy.  Camu jeans.  Our name is on your lips.  What is life for?  Camu.  Tight, hot, and great in a crisis. 
[03:01:30]  Like you.  Camu fit.  They hug you close,  even when you're in torment.  They're specially cut to show off  what you've got.  They give you meaning.  Mmm.  Camu.  Camu.  Push that rock, Sisyphus.  Read our lips.  I'm in pain.  Camu jeans.  It's her toe.  Soak them in the bathtub  before you pull them on.  Camu jeans.  When the line forms for your rear,  be elated for a moment.  Camu.  Camu.  There's actually an animation 
[03:02:00]  to it as well.  If you go to the website,  it's just a shot of a camel toe.  Of course.  Of course it is.  Let's go to Schwuggy.  Schwuggy.  Hey guys, what's going on?  Welcome aboard, Schwug.  Hey, little Jimmy.  Gold Digger jeans was a parody ad  from the original cast  of Saturday Night Live  with Gilder Ryder and Jane Kirkland.  You were in love  with the mockery.  No.  Yeah.  I know the ad  that Jimmy's talking about.  I remember it.  We're going to have to find it now. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  There might have been  a mockery of Gold Digger.  Yeah, they probably did.  It was probably a hot commercial.  Yeah.  Or I think they were just...  It was done in the late 70s  with the takeoff  when all the designer jeans were hot.  Yeah, but we were talking  about a real commercial.  My bad.  He's right.  If I was duped,  I was just a boy in love.  No.  I didn't know anything  except love.  My heart spoke.  I remember.  And now my heart is saying,  you're a buzzkill, stupid.  I have a question out there 
[03:03:00]  for any of the tech heads  because Laszlo was trying to help me.  I'm going from my PC to my Mac  and one of the problems  is I have an external hard drive.  I have iTunes.  And I want to copy and paste  all my iTunes onto the external  and then put it on my Mac.  Now, the problem I'm having  is whenever you copy and paste,  a lot of my titles  and my songs are the same thing  because I have a lot of live CDs.  So it'll be track 01, War Pigs.  And there's three other ones.  Track 01, War Pigs.  My iTunes doesn't give a fuck.  Why would you do it like that? 
[03:03:30]  No, no, no.  That's just what they're called.  Yeah.  That's what they're called.  They're called,  I'm going to do a change of time.  There's like six different concerts  from the same tour.  I have a lot of live Sabbath.  Change the name.  I don't like doing that.  What am I going to call it?  War Piglets?  War Piggies?  Do you have a lot of music  that you've purchased on iTunes?  Yes.  You're going to have a tough time  moving those over  unless you deauthorize the machine.  All right.  Let's say I deauthorize  the one machine  and my fucking,  and my stupid iPod  understands that, right? 
[03:04:00]  Supposedly.  Yes.  Stupid iPod.  Now, but how do I put  all these,  my fucking faggot Windows system  when I try to copy  and paste all the cunt iTunes?  I get the message,  do you want to replace  this one with that one?  I would just love  to have a camera on Jimmy  when he's fucking around  with his computer.  Oh, I know.  It's got to be hysterical.  Just going crazy.  But I say no I don't,  so now I have eight concerts  without War Pigs  because fucking faggot Windows  won't just copy and paste  what I told it to.  Why don't you just change  the name a little bit? 
[03:04:30]  In iTunes you don't have to.  Why should I have to  anywhere else?  iTunes takes it.  iTunes is reading the metadata.  That's what I was thinking.  In the pre-track.  What is metadata?  It's data.  You know what?  It's like a medical emergency?  It's data that's embedded  inside the thing.  The data of the track?  The thing.  Why doesn't fucking faggot Windows  just read the title?  Windows is too busy.  No time for metadata  just reading the titles.  Metadata is for queers.  Let's go to Keith in New York.  He might help you, Jimmy.  Keith.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Are you looking to copy 
[03:05:00]  the songs from Windows  to your Mac?  No.  I want to redistribute them  under my own label.  Well, that's an entirely  different thing altogether.  Of course.  Yeah, which I know  one of the things  you have to do,  metadata aside,  you have to,  like, my iPod  is set for PC.  Okay.  So I don't know how,  not only do I have  to deauthorize the computer,  I have to take everything,  I have to transfer them  from my iTunes on my PC  to my iTunes on my Mac,  and then I have to change 
[03:05:30]  my stupid, uh...  The only song...  Oh, sorry, go ahead.  I was trying to finish up  what I had to do,  but you just jump right in  and fix it.  I've been doing this  for 20 years.  Okay.  The only songs you have  to deauthorize  are any ones  that you purchased  from the iTunes music store.  If it's just stuff  that you ripped off of a CD  or, God forbid,  downloaded from LimeWire  or someplace like that,  there's no authorization  on those.  Well, a lot of it  has been purchased.  Okay.  So the stuff that has been  purchased through iTunes,  that does have to be  deauthorized,  but all you basically  have to do,  you can do that in iTunes, 
[03:06:00]  and it'll just make  the songs not playable  in your Windows version.  You copy the files over,  plus the thing with  stuff you buy from iTunes,  you can put them  on five different computers.  So, I mean,  if, God forbid,  the hard drive crashed  on Windows,  you don't want to be  bothered with it,  and you're not going  to put it on three  more computers  after the one you have now,  then you don't even  have to bother  deauthorizing,  although it is  a decent idea.  But if I deauthorize,  because what happens  is this,  I want to start traveling  with my Mac,  I want to try it,  so I want to put my iTunes  on there instead  of my laptop. 
[03:06:30]  So, if I deauthorize  one computer,  is there any way  to reauthorize it  some other time  if I deauthorize  the new one?  Oh, sure,  because basically  what you're authorizing  and deauthorizing  is there's metadata  in the M4A files,  and it knows  how many machines  it's authorized for.  Okay, but the metadata,  like my songs  won't disappear.  No.  No, the files  will still be there.  Will they?  Whether or not.  All right.  Can you do it  at a DOS prompt?  Can we just make  a phone call?  Now that you're still 
[03:07:00]  on the line, though,  can I talk to you  about my cup holder?  It won't go back in.  And how do I use  the foot pedal?  Exactly.  Wait, wait, wait,  but we're going  to get through this.  But sure,  do I have to,  do I have to fucking,  how do I change my,  no, but open your toolbar.  How do I change  my stupid,  my thing is set  to PC,  my iPod.  How do I change it  now to Mac  without losing  all the stuff  on my thing?  Well, the iPod's  just a hard drive.  It's got digital  rights management on it  so that you can't  see the songs on there. 
[03:07:30]  There are software  utilities you can  download for the Mac  so that you'll be able  to see all the songs  on it.  You just dump it  to the hard drive,  then you wipe the iPod  and then you reformat it.  Just wipe it,  format it for a Mac,  put the shit back on.  But I need help,  I don't know how  to do all of this.  All of this business  is frightening.  Well, you can contact  me offline,  I can help you.  Okay, give me your  number on the radio.  This is exactly  why I never did a full-time,  like, hour-long  tech radio show.  That's what it would be.  My screensaver's broken! 
[03:08:00]  Is it?  Great.  Yeah.  I'm having trouble  trying to,  yeah, okay,  here's what you do now.  Go to your GOS.  What?  I need a Mac person  to help me.  They have the Mac geniuses.  But the whole reason  that you're switching over  is so that your girlfriend  isn't on the same computer,  isn't that correct?  No, actually, no,  because I'm traveling.  I actually want to have one  that I only use  for photo and for audio.  My PC's got so much  fucking crap on it,  my laptop,  it's slow. 
[03:08:30]  By crap,  you mean pornography.  I'm sure there's  so many viruses.  No, there's not, actually.  I'm fucking,  I'm fucking  Victor virus cleaner.  The computer actually has AIDS.  The first computer  to ever have real AIDS.  You don't understand  how many fucking spyware  and antivirus stuff.  No, no, no.  How do you know,  by the way,  if someone has one of those  fucking,  here's a question  for the old key logger.  How do you know  if a key logger  is on your computer?  Blah, blah, blah.  You can get software  that will...  It should be picked up  if you run your fucking  antivirus.  But that's not a virus.  It's considered malware, 
[03:09:00]  I believe.  It should be picked up  by some of the  antivirus programs.  Will Norton do it?  Jimmy Norton?  No.  So, antivirus?  I don't completely  trust Norton.  No?  I mean,  I use it,  but they tend to be  a little bit  behind the curve sometimes.  Oh.  So,  who do you think  put a key logger on there?  I'm just curious.  Are you that paranoid  about your girlfriend  that you think  you've had the girlfriend  for like what?  No, no, no.  Not to do the girlfriend,  actually.  I'm just curious.  He read something.  Online probably  about a gamer.  Like, wow. 
[03:09:30]  World of Warcraft,  there's a whole thing  going on that  one of the programs  from one of the fan sites  are downloading key loggers  and people are getting  the passwords,  the characters,  stealing the character,  selling them online,  giving away all their shit,  and then you log on,  your character's gone.  That's like a huge thing  right now going on  with World of Warcraft.  A lot of download  rumor or not.  No, it's not rumor.  It's not someone's  putting a key logger  on these, um...  Absolutely.  Jesus.  And they, you know,  they always say,  well, it's the Russian mafia 
[03:10:00]  or somebody like that  or something like  the Russian mafia.  It's always the Russian mafia.  Some like international group,  but I mean, it's...  Syndicate.  It's easy money.  All right, let's go to  Gabe in Houston.  Gabe.  Let's syndicate.  Gabe.  Hey, can we start talking  about calculus or something?  Well, you know what,  this is...  Something a little more interesting.  I'm with Gabe.  Laszlo is here  to talk about technology  and I had a couple of questions.  And I know a lot of people  out there have iPods  and have had to deal with this.  So it's kind of like  one of those things  that we all kind of learn from.  Sorry, Gabe.  It's 2006  and people actually  have fucking computers.  Yeah, but he has a lot  of really interesting  tech stuff to talk about. 
[03:10:30]  Well, you're talking  about World of Warcraft.  You know those...  I'm always talking about  like Entropia  and Second Life,  those perpetual online worlds.  Yep.  The politicians  are starting to sniff around  World of Warcraft  and games  and perpetual online worlds  because of the fraud.  Crime.  And they're afraid  that kids are going  to be exposed to gambling.  So this also comes from,  I believe,  one of the games,  can't remember the name,  but you buy buildings  in the game, 
[03:11:00]  you own buildings  and make revenue  and then put it in the bank.  And there was this one  huge bank in this game  where everyone put  their credits  or whatever they call  the money  and the guy  that ran the bank  ran off with everyone's money.  Just like real life.  And people are complaining  and want him arrested  and everything  and the police are saying,  this isn't real.  It is a virtual crime  in a game.  We cannot do anything.  The guy ran off  with everyone's money  from the bank  that he owned.  Did it cost real money  to get in there or no?  I think so, yeah. 
[03:11:30]  Second Life?  Is that it?  I don't think so.  That is wild.  There's another one.  What did he do?  How did he cash it in?  I don't know.  He just took all their credits  and now in the game,  he's rich.  You can get ATM cards  that are tied  to your virtual money  because there's  a currency conversion  of like 10  of their money units  equals one American dollar.  So you can actually  fashion swords  and make clothing  and sell it  to other ding-dongs 
[03:12:00]  and make real money.  But at such a  ridiculously cut-down rate.  But the guy  took everybody's money.  Good for him.  Good for him.  Bunch of nerds  sitting home,  and I don't have  any more virtual dollars.  How am I supposed  to make a virtual purchase  without virtual dollars?  I don't know.  Why don't you put  a virtual gun  in your mouth?  Fucking get some  virtual pussy  and shut your fucking  virtual mouth.  I enjoy living  in a world  that's rich  with fantasy 
[03:12:30]  and fun.  And I can teleport.  I build a world  that I would want  to live in.  It's hot right now.  I know it is.  It's taken over.  Maybe you could  log on  and get an  anti-frown spell.  Which would be  imagine that.  See?  Virtual smile.  In the online world,  my name is Dirk  and I'm very handsome.  Dirk.  The online gals  are always  complimenting me  on my smile 
[03:13:00]  and my shiny teeth.  All right.  That's interesting.  What else  we got there last?  Oh, well,  you were talking  about the picture  of the chick  bending over  spreading her eyes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is all over  the inner tubes  these days.  This guy went  on Craigslist  as a woman  posting that picture  of the chicks  doing like a  goat seed thing there  and made this whole ad  and I actually 
[03:13:30]  printed it out for you  so he could read  what the guy posted  as a woman.  Got all these responses  and then made like  a Wikipedia entry  type blog  of every response  that he got  from guys wanting  to bang this chick.  Their email addresses,  their mobile phone numbers,  employees at Microsoft  and I posted the link there,  Anthony.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing  how many guys  will email pictures  of their cock.  Yes, we will.  These are just  a load of frigate. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, gosh.  There's a huge cock.  What, these are all  the people that responded?  Oh, this guy's jacking.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  And he put them  on a site?  Why would a guy...  Oh, so these are  all the guys that...  The Bone Ranger.  The Bone Ranger answered.  Well, read the ad  there, Laszlo.  Here's the ad verbatim.  I have everything I need  at my place.  That is where we will play. 
[03:14:30]  No exceptions.  We'll play at my place.  Got it.  I fucking hate yuppies.  I am one.  Pretty boys suck.  I fucking hate them all.  All they can do  is come for 2.2 seconds  and go to sleep.  Looking for rough man,  comma, Harley rider.  She says,  or he says as her,  it drives me crazy  to get tit-fucked,  cuffed,  ass-spanked  with welts and bruises.  I have a leg spreader,  crop cane,  and metal cuffs.  Do you?  One of my favorite responses  is a guy took a picture  very intricately laid out 
[03:15:00]  of all of his torture tools.  Good fan.  One guy's got a piercing  through his dick  and another guy's got  like some leather  fucking ball bag device.  What is that thing?  I have no idea  and don't want to know.  And then there's pictures  of, hey,  a guy just sitting around  like playing,  it looks like,  PlayStation.  And then right next to that  is a picture of him  totally naked jerking off.  I can do anything.  I can do anything.  There's a guy working  on his car  and a guy with a fucking 
[03:15:30]  butt plug up his ass.  I like how guys will,  some guys will just  type one sentence  and others will put  like a little missive  and they'll have a picture  of them with their dog.  You know,  like,  oh, aren't we cute together?  Yeah, yeah.  Look,  I'm a normal person  and I jerk off.  So,  the dude that did  this experiment,  I think his name  is Jason Fortuney,  he's a 30-year-old guy  up in Seattle  and he's getting  fucking death threats.  Good.  People are threatening  to sue him. 
[03:16:00]  Good.  I'll sue you.  He should because  these guys are just  actually answering  just a chick's ad.  It's like,  they're not doing  anything wrong.  They're just trying  to get laid.  Why would he fucking  cock block and be  such a little  fucking cunt about it?  What a faggot.  Go after pedophiles.  It's one of the risks  you take, though,  when you're posting  shit online like that.  Some other fucking  cock blocker guy  is going to jump in  and do that shit.  This guy should have  his fucking throat cut.  Go after pedophiles.  If you want to do that shit,  go after fucking  kid touchers, man.  Hey.  It does bring up the, 
[03:16:30]  we all got to have our fun.  It does bring up the issue  that, you know,  people think there's  some kind of anonymity  online and it really isn't.  Yeah.  Right, that's true.  I mean,  you don't know  who's sending that shit out.  Getting the other end of that.  Hey, hey, hey.  Especially if you're  supposed to be  in a committed relationship.  Right.  There you go.  Now, 9-11 was yesterday.  Hey, Laszlo,  what's this with  the plane simulator?  This guy,  I couldn't believe  I got a link  to this yesterday.  Somebody made  a flight simulator  using Google Maps. 
[03:17:00]  You know,  if you go to Google Maps,  they've got those  really intricate shots  where you can,  you know,  almost read license plates  it seems like.  You can really zoom in.  And there's a flight simulator  of New York City  and D.C.  and you can fly  a plane around  and smash into buildings.  Really?  Yeah.  Because I got...  I posted a link  there for you.  Yeah, I got one running.  It's like this little...  You're overhead, though.  Cheesy airplane.  It's not a very good  flight simulator.  It's an overhead view.  You have to use  the arrow keys, Anthony. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, wow.  Fly around.  Come on, Anthony.  Just...  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Go up, go up.  Yesterday,  Thurman Munson?  Yesterday,  I smashed into  57th and 6th.  Now, I'll turn.  Look at...  Yeah, but they don't fucking...  You're not in the plane, though.  You're on top.  You're like flying above the plane  watching it.  What fun is that?  Uh-oh.  It's kind of hacky.  Oh, yeah, I just crashed.  That's...  Right into a building.  Jesus.  I thought it was an odd thing  to launch on.  That is a little cheesy, but...  Wait, what's goggles  and not Google? 
[03:18:00]  It says...  Goggles.  Googles.  Now, Anthony,  are you the kind of guy  that would actually  send them a request  to blur out your house  on Google Maps  and Google Earth?  Do they do that?  Yeah.  Yeah?  No.  There are certain buildings  that are blurred out.  Oh, I didn't know that.  So you're home...  I think that was sort of federal  or some kind of like...  Well, you could maybe CIA thing.  You could say that it...  You know...  You could have...  Put Club Soda Kinney on the case.  I don't know.  I've looked at overhead views  of my house and stuff and...  Is it accurate?  No.  It's like from years ago. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  It's from years ago  and like there's an old house  that used to be there  that they kind of knocked down  and built a new one.  Dude, none of us  are that hard to find.  If they want to find out  where we live,  let up a fucking...  You know where we work.  Whatever.  I live in New York  and I'm building.  What are you going to do?  I live in New York  and I'm building.  Come on.  Come...  All right.  Laszlo, what else we got here?  Well, I brought another thing  from GTA as well  if you want to hop.  Oh, yeah.  We can listen to that.  Jim Florentine actually  did a character for me. 
[03:19:00]  We finally got to spoof  fishing shows  because I used to watch  fishing shows  in the early 80s  because I lived in Oklahoma  and you had that in Hee Haw.  And...  You know about that noodling then?  Oh, yeah.  Have you ever noodled?  No, but I've seen  chicks in bikinis do it  and it's the weirdest thing ever.  With gloves?  Fuck that.  No, dude.  Standing in a river  reaching under logs  and grabbing out  enormous catfish  with their hands  just by shoving their hand  down the catfish's face.  Fuck that.  It is the weirdest... 
[03:19:30]  Dude, we have hooks.  I've seen the pictures.  I've seen the videos.  We have fucking hooks.  You don't have to go out there  like it's 3 AD  or some shit.  But it's illegal  in some states now.  How is it illegal  to fist a fish?  I think because  supposedly...  Dangerous.  And it's too easy  and they're getting  way too many.  That's what I think.  If you fucking  catch a fish  with your bare hands  while letting it  sink its teeth in you,  you earned it.  Yeah, you're in like  a creek or a swamp.  Or you're Steve.  It's like...  You don't know  what else is in there?  I mean,  you gotta have  massive balls 
[03:20:00]  to do that.  Would you do that?  Fuck no.  Dude, we have hooks.  We have dynamite.  The best way to fish ever.  They're reaching into holes  they can't even see  or under logs  like you said.  They reach under a log.  Anything scares  the shit out of me.  Also what?  The catfish just  chomps down  on the whole fist?  Yeah.  And then you pull it out.  Fuck that.  Are they too sharp catfish?  There's a...  There are like  redneck competitions  with chicks  literally  in hot clothing  out there  doing it  and all these guys  on shore  drinking beer 
[03:20:30]  like,  yeah, look  she got her a bacon.  Oh, no way.  They hurt when they bite you?  Dude, I've never done it.  I'm telling you.  Just dangle her  big white trash clit  in one of the fucking holes.  Come on.  Bite.  Alright, so what's...  You're taking  on the fishing show here.  Oh, so we did a show  called Bait and Switch.  This is just like  60 seconds of it  but I...  It'll be in the new  GTA game.  Yeah, man.  In late October,  I believe.  Uh, yeah.  Late October.  Somewhere around there.  Now, back to 
[03:21:00]  Bait and Switch.  Woohoo!  Oh, you are shit-faced,  aren't you?  Nice.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, hell.  Wait.  Oh, you're going to smell  something in about  two seconds.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah.  Now, we're men.  Yeah.  Uh, moving on  with the show.  Yeah.  Alright, now today's  a special episode  of Bait and Switch  coming at you  from the Vice City 
[03:21:30]  Boat and Sports Show.  Yeah, it's incredible, you know what I mean?  These boats.  I mean, you know, you see guys standing around thinking about what comes natural and primal.  You know, like in a circle.  Fishing these parts, see, it's all about selecting the right way to go after your prey.  You really got to think about how to approach the fish, you know?  What kinds of pole you're going to use.  And make sure you use the right bait.  I mean, I use a stink bait by rubbing night crawlers or grubs on my junk.  Real nice.  It's unresistible, my junk. 
[03:22:00]  Legendary.  Woo-hoo, hey, yeah, yeah.  And there you have it.  So, and in two, three weeks, I'll be bringing in some clips of some of the crew here.  Ah.  Yeah, let's get to it, man.  What platforms are these?  PS2.  PS2?  Is by City Stories.  Yeah, PS2.  Do you play PS2?  The screen bother you?  Is it PSP?  PSP, I'm sorry.  No, I play PSP.  It comes out from PS2.  Um, do you ever play the PS2? 
[03:22:30]  Uh, no.  That, I have a tough time even sitting in front of that thing anymore.  Yeah.  It's like a six-year-old console.  I know.  Don't play it.  All right.  I need huge monitor.  Non-interlaced.  Nice picture.  I don't want to need it on a friggin' television set.  What's interlaced mean?  Yeah, it's when you hook it up to your TV.  Looks like shit.  What's up with the PS3?  Delayed.  Again, right?  Why?  The whole regulations thing?  No, not the regulations thing. 
[03:23:00]  It's, uh...  They have a problem with their thing.  They have a metadata problem.  The metadata.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, uh, Turtle from Whack Bag.  What do you got?  Hey, guys.  The reason to snoodle it...  The noodle...  Fuck!  Punch it out.  Say it.  Just say it.  You punched out?  Yeah, but he didn't wreck the punchline.  He was just saying noodling.  He could have got through that.  The reason to noodling...  He's saying the reason noodling is illegal is because of the snapping turtles or biting people.  Good.  Well, good.  That's nature.  Nature hurts. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  What else we got here?  Laszlo.  We got poker.  We got...  Oh, yeah.  Always got to bring up poker.  We got YouTube.  We got, uh...  Anthony, are you still playing, uh...  I play online, yeah.  You know that one of the big sites actually shut down, and I don't know if it's back  up yet, but whenever the...  It's a British company.  One of the largest.  It's like betonsports.com.  Yep.  Um, now had their second executive from that company arrested as soon as he came on U.S. soil. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  A guy decided to fly over here, and the second he got off the plane, they arrested him.  For what?  Because it's...  Running a gambling site.  Because they're cracking down on, uh, online gambling.  But how can...  Can the fucking government keep their fucking hands out of our fucking personal lives?  No.  This is a...  Holy shit.  This is a legal London company...  Yeah.  ...in Britain that's, like, on the London Stock Exchange, and their executives are being  arrested at the airport when they're flying through to other places.  What are they...  Are they saying that it's because they can't block access from America and they don't? 
[03:24:30]  Cocksucker U.S. government.  You really can't.  How are you going to block access, really?  Yeah, and regulate...  At that point, you're becoming China.  This is one of these things where, yeah, it's just going to...  The government's got to suck it up.  They want...  Money.  They want money.  What should it...  Well, money.  They don't care about the people.  Can you explain why they're able to arrest them?  Yeah.  If it's legal in Britain?  No.  What are they getting them on?  It's like anything else.  It's like porn.  Like fucking kiddie porn. 
[03:25:00]  Because they're saying it's in violation of the wire transfer.  Act or whatever.  There was like a gambling law that was passed years ago.  And they're now trying to say that it's gambling and doing any kind of online poker is the same as, you know, placing a bet with a bookie.  I mean, same reason that they can arrest somebody who's manufacturing cocaine in Colombia.  It's not our territory, but they just fucking go down there and do it.  Yeah.  You know?  It's different, though. 
[03:25:30]  I mean, because gambling is legal here in places.  Cocaine is not.  I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like fucking...  I'm really getting disgusted with the U.S. government.  Keep your fucking hands out of people's fucking business.  Yeah.  If somebody can't control themselves and lose everything gambling, that's their...  That's their fucking business.  It's not the government's job to step in and regulate everything just because a few people can't control themselves.  But they don't care about the individual.  No, it's really not about that.  They just want their cut. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, they want their money.  And how about this?  If you're going to make something illegal because you care, fuck gambling.  How about alcohol?  Let's go after that.  Nobody gambling drives into a family of six.  You understand?  You drunk drive, you kill people.  They're not trying to outlaw that.  Leave people alone.  Never.  Alcohol.  Fucking repressive government.  Alcohol and tobacco tops the list of things that kill people.  Fuck the U.S.  And, you know, it's just so ingrained in this country.  But go after online poker.  Yeah, online poker and video games that are violent. 
[03:26:30]  You've got to go after that.  It's all distractions.  Who's pushing the gambling thing more, the Democrats or the Republicans?  The Republicans.  I mean, it's always that...  Because the Democrats go after the video games.  But I think it's one of those things that they could both, you know, look at this.  Oh, my God.  Both parties come together on this one.  Yeah.  Save more money.  That's the easy one, yeah.  And they push through these stories of, like, teens are playing online poker to make money  so they can buy music on iTunes.  There's all these sensationalist stories about how these poker sites go after young kids and, 
[03:27:00]  you know, to wish they had that crap when I was a kid.  A bunch of responsible adults can't gamble because some cunt fucking parent wants to work  two jobs so her and her fucko cheating husband can have two cars in the garage.  How about this?  Fucking drown your children, you motherfuckers.  So we can play poker.  I don't even gamble.  I don't play online poker.  I think it stinks.  It's great.  But it's fucking right of an adult to do it.  Yes.  Go after kiddie porn.  Go after all this shit.  Go after drunk drivers and leave the fucking gamblers alone. 
[03:27:30]  And go after parents.  You're fucking teenagers at gambling.  That's your problem, shit dicks.  Very good.  Fucking sick of it.  Absolutely right.  Adults, responsible adults have to suffer because you didn't have the guts to stick it in  her mouth or up her fucking dumb suburban asshole.  That's where you should have put your dick in her dirty flu ass.  Flu ass?  Flu?  He's upset with the flu ass today.  All I can think of is flu ass and how lubricated your cock would be. 
[03:28:00]  I don't want my children to grow up to be gamblers.  I'd prefer them to get involved with after school activities like raping retarded girls  in the woods.  Meanwhile, you turn on ESPN and it's not people doing like athletic things.  It's a bunch of fatso sitting at a table at the World Series of Poker.  Gambling, yeah.  Right, exactly.  What are they supposed to do?  It's a great commercial for online gambling.  Hey, what else there, Lazlo?  Anything else worth mentioning?  YouTube maybe?  You guys keep talking about all the Opie and Anthony videos that are going up on YouTube. 
[03:28:30]  You can actually rip those from YouTube using, there's a couple pieces of software.  One's called PodTube for Mac and iTube for Windows.  So you can pull all the Opie and Anthony videos off of YouTube onto your iPod and show your friends.  Wow.  You use Mac or PC.  That's pretty cool.  I have two of each.  Everyone uses both now.  You have to, right?  Everybody you ask now, unless they're the most casual of computer users, they're always like,  what do you use? 
[03:29:00]  Both.  You need both now.  Let me ask you a question, Lazlo.  If I want to have Mac and put a Windows on it, like with Parallel, the program Parallel,  you can put Windows on a Mac and it can run both.  Yes, you can do that now since they switched to the Intel chip.  Intel chip.  Yeah.  Do you recommend that?  Why not?  All right.  I would think you'd need a pretty strong system.  Yeah.  You're going to have to have a pretty strong system, but.  I see something that's pretty interesting here.  The DVRs taking over the world.  That's the only way I watch TV now.  I always bring up some kind of DVR tech. 
[03:29:30]  I love it because I watch two one-hour shows.  That would be two hours normal time in like an hour and 20 minutes.  They're now.  They're trying to get around us fast-forwarding through commercials.  Yeah, and we've talked in the past about how they will try to set restrictions on what  you can fast-forward through.  I don't know why the fuck you buy a box that doesn't let you fast-forward.  Exactly.  But now they're saying, well, maybe we can sell additional advertising and give advertisers  a way to get their commercials impressions on people as they're fast-forwarding through 
[03:30:00]  a technology in the DVR that only shows the key frames.  Because when you fast-forward through something on DVR, it just flashes some of the key frames  of the commercial.  So now they're talking about a technology that will basically make the commercial kind  of like a flip book.  Remember the old flip book?  Oh, jeez.  I don't care.  So that like on the key frames, they're putting images.  So you get like a really quick animation with a logo popping up.  That's fine. 
[03:30:30]  So at least you're getting something.  Make them work for it.  How about just make some fucking funny commercials like they do in Europe?  Those are great commercials.  People would watch them.  Where they show boobies.  But they're funny.  They're all banned in America.  Of course they are.  I watch all those on YouTube as well.  Your guy's commercial was funny.  They won't even show up because of the fucking word ass in it.  Ass.  Maybe that's why we fast-forward, you faggot motherfuckers.  Did you see the YouTube video where it's a banned commercial and the kid is on his computer  and some chick is getting naked and stuff?  That thing is hilarious. 
[03:31:00]  You know, talking dirty and she starts disrobing and stuff.  And then the mom yells, it's dinner time or whatever.  That's what I'm assuming because it's in a different language.  So now the next shot, they're all around the dinner table.  And the kid looks up and sees his sister across the table and realizes that she's wearing the  exact same outfit of the girl he just had strip online.  And then she looked up and realized that, you know, he had the same freaking shirt on that  she saw through her webcam. 
[03:31:30]  Is that hilarious?  Hilarious.  But it's banned in America.  Of course it is.  You're not going to show anything like that.  Why would they show something fun?  And then it's just some awkward look.  They look down or whatever and that's the end of the commercial.  That's why it was so depressing when I got my degree in advertising was they would show  you all these awesome commercials like, here are the things you can do.  Right.  If you move out of the country.  Yeah, not here.  You know, repressive.  I don't know why I'm so fucking a flaming liberal I sound like.  I'm really getting disgusted.  DVR, you can't fast-forward their commercials. 
[03:32:00]  How about this?  If you can't fast-forward, I submit that you throw your DVR out the window and aim for  a stroller.  Kill two birds with one stone.  Is that it?  My favorite is the technologies that they're talking about putting in the new Blu-ray players  and stuff like that.  What are those?  That they can actually – well, the new DVD players, they're so concerned about it  getting hacked and people being able to buy illegal movies off the street and play them 
[03:32:30]  that they are working on putting technology inside that because all these are going to  be network-connected devices.  Yep.  That either the device marks you out if you try to do something, you know, like put a  movie that you bought on 8th Avenue into the thing.  Or if a hack comes out for that piece of equipment, they can send a kill signal from the main offices  at Sony and make all the players go dead nationwide.  That's great.  Isn't that good?  Make all the players that have the hack thing in them. 
[03:33:00]  Well, yeah, they basically want to have control over the device from the main whatever.  From Central Headquarters.  From the obelisk.  What are you talking about?  I don't mind them like stopping illegal or stolen shit like that because that's – I  mean that is a crime to go steal on somebody's work.  Fucking guys pull out money in the films and then there's some fucking filthy, indescribable  ethnic animal on the fucking street with foreskin or is it just dirt you can't tell?  Hawking your fucking life's work for three bucks so he can send money to his fucking 
[03:33:30]  awful hairy cunt and wife back in whatever cesspool they live in?  Fuck them.  They should be shut down.  My buddy called me from Thailand and said he was in a market where like eight different  products that I've worked on were being sold for a dollar.  I wanted to go over there and fucking bomb them.  I was like, you fucking savages.  What do you think?  They have a fucking good regulation system over there?  They fucking raffle children off in the airport.  Well, they should.  Let's get a Frank in West Virginia.  Frank. 
[03:34:00]  Yo, what's up, guys?  Tim, you're on fire today, right?  I'm just really annoyed.  I'm enjoying it.  What's up, Frank?  Not too much.  Not too much.  Oh.  Sorry.  Yes, sir?  In any case, yeah, we actually already have the technology where you – excuse me,  fast forward and we still see the banner with advertising.  Oh, we have that already?  Yeah.  Or you do?  Yeah.  Really?  That's fine.  As long as it doesn't interfere with your life, that's a good idea.  That's being clever.  And if you make that interesting enough, you're going to watch it a few times.  You're going to actually rewind and go, wow, look what they did. 
[03:34:30]  Like, you know, the flip book went all the way across my screen or whatever.  Can you imagine if commercials – I'm sorry to interrupt you at last.  Can you imagine if commercials were funny and intriguing like they used to be and there  was something about them?  Instead of those fucking faggot Budweiser lizards, which were really funny at first, the frogs,  and now it's become this corny, overplayed – oh, the clever lizard.  Go fuck yourself.  It's not funny anymore.  I want to see the lizard, like, get really drunk and then fucking beat his amphibian wife.  That'd be nice. 
[03:35:00]  Punches her in the face and calls her a cunt.  Throws her off the log.  Then has a meister brow and shits his pants.  All right.  We've done there, Les.  What do we got?  To that guy's point, the technology is out there, but somebody's patented it now, which  is half the problem with a lot of the technology.  Now, people come out and say, well, you know, I have a patent for a device that plays music  off of a hard drive.  So then they go after, you know, iTunes or whomever, and there's all – 
[03:35:30]  They never intend on making it.  Right.  So they own the patent, and then it keeps other companies from actually making it because they  got to pay this guy.  I'm annoyed because I've got a DVR from Dish Network, and they're in some fight with TiVo  over a patent, and if the wrong side wins, they say they're going to shut off my DVR.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Well, I have Time Warner cable.  Which one will that affect?  That shouldn't affect you, Jimmy.  Yeah, you'll be all right.  You'll be fine.  I had fucking DirecTV with a TV. 
[03:36:00]  That was really great.  I loved it.  A hundred hours.  My friend Chris looked at it.  A hundred hours.  You could fucking watch.  It was good.  Everything.  Cool.  All right.  We'll take a break.  More with Laszlo.  Laszlo's doing a show on 202 this Saturday?  Saturday, 9 p.m.  9 p.m.  To midnight Eastern Standard Time.  Spread the word.  With the normal Laszlo show crew.  Okay.  And what else?  What else?  What else?  Oh, we got to do Bill Burr on editing before we get out of here today.  So stay there.  Eddie and Anthony.  I've been gangbanging, killing, skidding, rob, motherfuckers. 
[03:36:30]  Static crack, got my holes in the back.  I don't give a fuck about nobody in this motherfucker.  Let me show your ass up.  What the fuck I'm working, man?  What you gonna do, nigga?  Huh?  Hey, nigga.  It's a fucking thing.  Radio for the angry golfer.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What did I miss? 
[03:37:00]  I heard it.  I heard it got heated in here.  No, no, no, no, no.  We were kidding.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Laszlo said something about Blockbuster.  Yeah.  What was it, Anthony, that said? 
[03:37:30]  Said, I haven't set foot in a Blockbuster video in five years.  We were talking about the movie theaters, because Jimmy said that they're going to be out of business.  Eventually.  Well, right now.  Once there's terrorist attacks in movie theaters, we're going into this society where, maybe not in our lifetimes,  we will eventually just be loners living to a virtual world.  I'm telling you, movie theaters will cease to exist maybe in 50 years.  Home theater equipment driven down to a price where everybody can afford.  It'll be standard.  Nice big TV.  Yeah, like standard equipment, surround sound system where you can now watch a movie at home 
[03:38:00]  and get the same effect you would in a theater.  Do you get the feeling when you're in these movie theaters now, you're like, this is so old-fashioned.  This is so old-fashioned.  You're looking like this.  The quality stinks.  My computer has a better picture than this.  The quality stinks.  My TV.  Yeah, and you're looking at other white people.  They're as terrified as you are.  You're like, let's watch this at home.  So, I mean, they got-  Loud mouths in front of you, behind you.  Yeah.  Weren't they supposed to update the movie theaters?  There was talk about that because they knew this was happening, that the people had better 
[03:38:30]  technology at home.  And they were talking about getting more 3D and digital and all this, and it just never  happened.  The theaters have been cock-blocking simultaneous release, which would make so much sense.  I mean, think about, like, if you took your kid to a movie and you walked out of the movie,  the kid's amped about it, and right there for sale is the DVD for 15 bucks.  The kid's going to be screaming for it.  You're going to sell a ton of them.  They won't let them release, because there's a lot of people, like myself, I don't go to  theaters anymore. 
[03:39:00]  I've been probably to a movie theater twice in the last 8 years.  I still like the experience going out, you know, catching a movie.  I go out enough.  What do they think?  You're going to come back 2, 3 times and watch movies.  That's why, right?  The theaters.  They're going to lose repeat business.  That's why they're afraid of it.  Well, they've been losing-  The total attendance of movie theaters has been dropping dramatically.  Well, yeah, because they're fucking ushers.  How about you give them guns, and they fucking kill people who are talking?  That's why we're not going.  That's cell phones. 
[03:39:30]  And they put it up on the screen.  Shut off your cell phone.  But some savages can't read and don't know how to shut it off.  I like to read, but they don't think that message is for them.  Dialing with their toes.  Talking real loud.  Talking real loud, because they're the most important person there, and everyone's got  to hear their fucking conversation.  And don't say a word, or you're getting knifed.  And Blockbuster, by the way, Keith said a couple in his town shut down good fucking RPG and  T.  It's a family establishment. 
[03:40:00]  Bring your children and have a few laughs.  Yeah, they shut down all the-  Fuck Blockbuster in the mouth.  All the non-family establishments in town can't survive.  Because, you know, do you remember the, before Blockbuster, the video store?  The little local store?  Oh, yeah.  They would have some-  They always had something a little special for you.  And they would have some, the new releases on VHS and Beta.  VHS.  But then they had that little section off to the side.  Behind the beads.  Right.  And then they had like a weird section for Kung Fu shit, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There was like martial arts movies, and then the section that was either behind the beads 
[03:40:30]  or the old style Western bar room doors.  Yeah.  Yeah, you'd have to go through there and walk around with a bunch of creeps looking at boxes  that were three feet wide by five feet tall.  Yeah, thanks for oiling the hinges so no one notices I'm going in there.  Jesus.  Big glossy cock on the cover.  J.O. Corral.  And by the way, those mom and pop places, fuck them too.  They had three copies of a new movie.  You could never get it.  At least Blockbuster had fucking 80 copies you could grab. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, the mom and pop had one on VHS, one on DVD, and one on like cassette.  How long did Blockbuster take to switch over to DVD also?  I remember going in there.  It took forever.  And they want to fucking charge you all these late fees?  Yeah, late fee my ass.  Don't fuck yourselves.  Netflix brings it to you.  Why should I go into that place?  I can't even get fucking the bad lieutenant the way I want it.  No NC-17, no X.  It's a family establishment.  For the price that it took for me with late fees, and believe me, every fucking movie, 
[03:41:30]  I'd be charged the late fees because that's how I am.  I can't be bothered with, I've got to get it back on time with this.  In time, I bring it back.  And then the late fees would always amount to I could have bought it.  So now when I see a movie that I want to buy, I buy it.  I don't go.  I don't go to Blockbuster and rent it.  I fucking buy it.  I'm glad that, you know where I buy my movies?  In fucking Tower Records because they sell them.  Or I fucking buy them when I'm going to buy porn.  They have to sell some real film.  That's where I bought all my Sopranos episodes in a jerk-off establishment. 
[03:42:00]  It's fucking the greatest.  Mom and pop places can really go fuck themselves.  They never have good stuff.  So the more of them that shut down, the fucking happier I am.  Them and Blockbuster.  All of them suck.  Who the hell?  I like to go to a mom and pop place to have my cup of joe.  Do you really?  It's always burned, you fucking assholes.  At least Starbucks has fresh, lovely coffee.  Some liberal douche working behind the counter.  Some fucking, usually a black homosexual. 
[03:42:30]  Right, they've got that whole stand of fucking CDs now  with some faggot blowing on a diggory-doo or whatever.  Yeah, Starbucks picks.  Starbucks picks.  I bought one of those CDs.  Of course you have.  I bought the myth.  Point of purchase.  It was Penn Station.  The guy.  Fucking diggory-doo.  What a faggot fucking aboriginal piece of shit a diggory-doo is.  What do you do?  I blow a six-foot tube.  Good.  And I don't like shit.  I bought the myth and then I got the CD and I brought it home and it sticks. 
[03:43:00]  It sucks.  My train was, I was waiting for my train on a slice of pizza and there's the, what's the  last one, what's it called?  A diggory-doo.  When I was a boy, I didn't know how to play with the guitar.  I was playing the diggory-doo in the band.  Mother told me I'd be a diggory-dooist till the day I die.  A chalky white fucking aboriginal guy.  His lips all fucking wrapped around that thing.  You have to breathe circularly.  Yeah? 
[03:43:30]  You ever heard of a fucking Casio keyboard?  I also don't like Starbucks gum because it's fucking loud.  I don't need plastic gum in a fucking tin so people know that I think my breath stinks  after my coffee.  Want to go for a kiss?  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka.  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka.  Well, either you're shaking a baby and battering him or you're eating some Starbucks gum.  Hold on, let's go for that kiss.  Quick. 
[03:44:00]  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka.  Fucking clinky plastic in a metal container.  Let's go, Jeff in Ohio.  Jeff, what's up?  We're talking about movies today.  How are you?  Welcome aboard, Jeff.  All right, Jeff.  You know, the movie theaters out here are trying to compete.  They just built this new movie theater, and they've got one section in the theater called  the Director's Lounge.  They pay a little bit more for the ticket.  The seats are leather reclined back, and up until the beginning of the movie, they'll  actually come in, take your order, and they've got everything from burgers and chicken 
[03:44:30]  sandwiches and stuff, and then they bring the food right to you at the chair.  Yeah, but I heard that there was a problem with that because there's something that happened.  Where are you again?  Ohio.  Right.  Well, this guy's going to call us the dummies.  Matt, DC, what's up?  Yeah, hey, you guys are calling it a diggeridoo?  I don't know what a diggeridoo is.  It just sounds like something I've yelled at my car window.  Is it a diggeridoo? 
[03:45:00]  A diggeridoo.  Whatever.  It's a fucking six-foot-long fucking aboriginal penis.  Exactly.  It's intestines.  Oh, no.  You're blowing into intestines.  All right.  I played the diggeridoo.  I would call it a diggeridoo, but then Mother would slap my face and say I was a frowning  dummy.  Mother, I want to play the diggeridoo.  Let's go to Kent, the movie guy.  I fucking hate that.  What's up, guys?  Yeah.  Hi, Kent.  Until America takes the theater companies anyway, take notice of what they're doing in  Japan, they're never going to do anything right. 
[03:45:30]  What's going on in Japan, man?  Talk was so long.  It was bent.  I was in Japan last summer.  I saw Star Wars there.  Did you?  You go up, first of all, and you buy your ticket for your seat.  No one else can sit in that seat.  It's yours, so you don't have to have a panic attack, and you can buy it online.  Well, that's important.  Well, it is.  Get up.  I hate fighting for seats.  I don't want to get there an hour before.  Yeah, that's what you're going to do.  Some six-foot gorilla.  Sir, if you'll look at my receipt, you're going to see that I was supposed to be here.  And you'll be getting a receipt from the fucking ambulance ride and the fucking tooth 
[03:46:00]  replacements you have after that fucking non-white fist crashes into your gum line.  Oh, you can find all your teeth on the rug.  Exactly.  You pick them up.  You got three popcorn kernels.  Oh, this is no good.  Could you improvise a little?  Maybe get that fucking creepy 48-year-old intern to build me a new set.  You guys got to be entertaining a bunch of knuckleheads half-loaded trying to find their  fucking seat in the dark like at a concert.  That's who you want, fixing your teeth?  Some fucking, some dope addict.  You guys are fucking working in a meth lab. 
[03:46:30]  You can just tell, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, he's awful.  You know he'd do awful shit, too?  He'd probably rub his dick on the teeth.  Passive-aggressive little bug-eyed creep.  I hate this fucking watch.  Hey, burn victimized!  Hey, look at his eyes like a-  Shut up!  He has eyes like a fucking burn victim, that kid.  He bugs me.  What an ugly bunch of interns.  Except for that Craig, he's got a nice build on him.  Is that that skinny guy?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Wow, Jimmy's lost his fucking mind. 
[03:47:00]  Kid's built like half a didgeridoo.  He's having a little Bill Burr moment over there.  Oh, we're going to play the Bill Burr thing when we leave here today.  Oh, Tucker Carlson dancing?  The white guy dancing.  The white guy dancing is fun.  Jeff, Kentucky, go.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy, I'll tell you what.  This is one of your best performances on the radio ever.  I've got to hand it to you.  You are on fire.  Thanks, sir. 
[03:47:30]  It feels average.  Everyone is saying it, man.  Roz, look.  It's just all day.  Roz, Connecticut, go.  Fucking Jimmy.  Best day since on XM, man.  You are just making me piss my pants.  Thanks.  Thanks, buddy.  It's nice to know that two years have sucked in your mind.  I get annoyed at Blockbuster, and all of a sudden, I'm fucking Lenny Bruce.  Go fuck yourself.  Hey, Sean.  Thank you, Ted.  Connecticut.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, Sean.  Listen, we've got a local regional video store down here.  It's called Tommy Cave.  And fuck Blockbuster.  So I'll tell you what, I get the red Mondo topless at this place. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah?  Oh, absolutely.  By the way, thank you to the person that sent in the Mondo topless poster.  And thank you for the person.  I'll be framing that.  The person who sent me the movie.  Someone sent me the film.  I loved it, dude.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you.  You want to do the Arnold thing before we get out of here?  Did you redo?  Oh, that's where he said some offensive things about hot-blooded people.  Yeah, it's great.  People of color.  Actually, this started last week.  How old is this clip?  I don't know.  We got the update today. 
[03:48:30]  This wasn't just a tempest in a teacup.  This was a tempestuous Latina.  Oh, it's her.  Who is that?  What's her name again?  Kunt?  Judy Moss.  Is that the chick from CNN?  She's the one that fucked us on the Voyager bus.  This isn't just a tempest in a teacup.  What the fuck is a tempest?  What the fuck are you talking about?  Whoever fucking actually deli-  I drank a tempest.  It was in my teacup.  I didn't say it.  This is little more than an Othello in the white room.  Fucking tempest in a teacup. 
[03:49:00]  Shakespearean horse shit.  I wish she'd say this is a little more than a boot in my cunt.  All right, let's get back to it.  This wasn't just a tempest in a teacup.  This was a tempestuous Latina in a teacup.  Tampon in her teacup.  She is a good night, buddy.  Yeah, and that fucking other golden drinker.  No, it's not a sex scandal.  It's just that the L.A. Times got hold of a taped conversation Arnold was having with  his staff when his chief of staff admiringly brought up California Assemblywoman Bonnie  Garcia.  Oh, it's new.  Is she Puerto Rican? 
[03:49:30]  She seems to be the Cuban.  And the next thing you know, Arnold unloads.  Puerto Rican, the same thing as Cuban.  I mean, they're all very hot.  They have the, you know, part of the black blood in them and part of the Latino blood in  them.  They're together and makes it.  California's governor said what?  He said part black blood and part Latino blood makes them hot.  I think he was right. 
[03:50:00]  The only thing people don't like to hear is things.  What the fuck is wrong with that, you liberal cunt?  Leave him alone.  He wasn't insulting them.  No.  He said part black blood and part Latina blood makes them hot.  Nothing degrading at all.  How is that an insult?  How many, fucking call some black politicians to task already.  Fucking dumb liberals.  God, they look for anything with the fucking Republicans.  Get that ghoul intern in here.  He's a blood expert.  Exactly.  I prefer A over the ice. 
[03:50:30]  Blah!  Well, Arnold had to apologize.  I apologize.  But Arnold said that when he saw his own words in the paper.  It made me cringe.  So he came before the media with his phone Republican.  Bonnie Garcia, I apologize to her.  She got offended, but I mean, she and her, we joke about all this many, many times when  she says, I'm a hot Latina.  Governor, there really is no reason to apologize. 
[03:51:00]  I am not mad that he recognizes that I am passionate about the issues.  The thing we didn't get was why the governor is taping himself in his office.  Because I have a certain way of speaking.  Arnold says he tapes himself so his speechwriter can capture the texture of how he talks.  So it don't sound like any other politician speaking.  I always like to sound like Arnold.  Like, how would Arnold speak?  Like a guy who has trouble terminating his tongue.  I swear to God. 
[03:51:30]  Shut up!  I fucking, and I don't know if this is appropriate.  I hope she's fucking raped and killed.  You know what?  I fucking hate her.  She uses alliteration.  A tempest to the teacup in the beginning.  Excuse me.  She talks like Frank the Frater with his lips stapled shut on the side.  This is not a tempest to the teacup.  Teacup.  Sorry, go ahead.  She gets all, she uses her tea.  She uses that alliteration at the beginning of the segment and the end to tie it all together.  We're going to use lots of tea words. 
[03:52:00]  That's what I learned at journalism school.  I tape my conversations.  Oh, he's a fucking boob.  Black-blooded Cuban.  Sounds like Arnold.  Part black blood, part Spanish blood makes some good fucks.  I don't know.  Conglomerated.  Malata.  Mangro.  Hottie.  But you know what?  Sometimes you apologize, just get it over with.  Like, all right, I'm sorry.  It's done.  He's been grabbing tits.  I love Arnold.  Oh, his whole career has been nothing but just broads, grabbing tits, ass, trying to 
[03:52:30]  hump women, dry hump them during interviews.  The guy's like a sex fiend.  What's the problem?  They elected him.  They knew what he was all about.  He was Mr. Universe.  Yeah.  This guy wasn't raised in fucking, you know, the school of, you know, whatever, fucking  Hints from Heloise.  Remember that?  I was from.  My father was a Nazi.  Fucking Mike.  Oh, get that out of the way.  Hi, there you are.  I thought you left.  Hello.  Why don't we get out of here?  I don't like leaving, Opie. 
[03:53:00]  I have fun with my friends.  Let's get the plugs in.  Lazlo's doing a show Saturday night.  Is he?  Saturday night, you can read more at lazlow.com.  The show will be right here on XM202, thanks to O&A.  Nice.  Nine to midnight Eastern.  Jimmy, you're doing a benefit tonight?  Hold on, I'm laughing, because Tucker's dancing on MSNBC.  Oh, my.  When a white guy dances, it's really, it's kind of irreverent and funny.  It's irreverent and funny.  You know.  A fucking bad wedding.  I hate white people. 
[03:53:30]  I fucking, I swear to God, I hope the blacks overrun us.  I fucking hate white people.  I hope there's a hell of a war beforehand, though.  Let me tell you.  I'm going to be in, I'm actually, I wasn't sure if I was doing this or not.  The Stress Factory tonight, it's just a one-shot deal.  I'm doing a benefit.  Masavi is a very good friend of mine.  His six-year-old son has cancer.  And a bunch of us did a benefit.  We're doing another one.  No, it's not.  It's awful.  Masavi's a sweet guy, man.  Patrice O'Neill will be there. 
[03:54:00]  I'll be there.  Vinnie Brand.  Black comedian named Talent.  He's very funny.  And presumptuous of a name, though.  What?  Talent?  His name is Talent?  Yeah.  Well, the name I wanted to give him was already taken back in 1640.  And also, this Thursday, there's an early show at the Comedy Cellar.  It's a 730 show.  Again, another cancer benefit for one of the waiters.  It's fucking miserable and depressing.  I know there's a lot of benefits we're plugging.  Make ones you can if you can't.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  We're going to end with Bill Burr. 
[03:54:30]  Okay.  We get the whole set.  This video's on YouTube.  I don't like the language on this.  Yes, it's a bit salty.  It's a great fucking thing to watch to see what a comedian does.  To watch this guy, to watch Billy, I like the fact you can see him kind of floundering internally at first.  Like, I'm going to make this work doing what a comedian, and then all of a sudden he just went, fuck it.  He saw what was going to happen, they were going to overrun him in a way, and he fucking, boom, smashed their faces.  Count the fucks.  He turned on them. 
[03:55:00]  Count the fucks.  I think it's over 100.  That's right.  Count the hyphens.  The short story, they started booing him for no reason, really.  Nah, one bit didn't work, and they gave him shit.  So, Billy said, fuck you all, he threw his act out the window, and just improv'd for 12 minutes, and just beat the shit out of 10,000 people.  That's great.  And by the end of it, most of the people there loved him.  And even the ones that didn't love him have to respect how hard what he did was, and how fucking effective it was.  It was great, man.  It was great to watch.  We're not going to talk or nothing. 
[03:55:30]  This is how we leave you today.  And if you want to see the video, YouTube, throw Bill Burr or Opie and Anthony in the search, and you'll find it, okay?  See you in the morning, folks!  Here it is, from the Tweeter Center, from Saturday night.  By the way, one last ONA traveling virus left.  Cleveland!  We added Otto and George, the great Otto and George, myself, of course, Opie and Anthony, fucking Patricio Neal, stupid Bob Kelly, and the fucking, you know, and Mr. Ed Teeth Voss.  Bill Burr, I think.  Oh, of course, Jesus, Bill Burr, of course, all of us.  We're going to add one more, too. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, and I hear a lot of people are going to road trip.  It's cool, because this is the end of the tour, so we want to make it a little special for everybody in Cleveland.  We love Cleveland, so we want to get out there again.  We leave you from Saturday night at the Tweet of Saturday in Camden, New Jersey.  Bill Burr, going off.  Bye.  Well, you don't stop talking, do you?  Like, ah, fuck it, I'll just cook this side for a while, just, you know what's funny?  I'm fucking my brain talking about nothing.  I can't.  I'm just walking around like, yeah, I just got a cheap burger. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, fuck all you people.  You know what, you fucking losers.  I hope you all fucking die, and I hope the fucking Eagles never win the Super Bowl.  That's fucking tough.  Fuck all you motherfuckers.  And fuck the Flyers.  Fuck all of you.  Fuck that damn fucking loser.  Who would die on my rarest?  Fuck a dick.  All of you.  Fuck a fucking dick.  How's that?  No, I'm sitting right in, into my next joke.  You get all rude dick, my fucking red nuts. 
[03:57:00]  All of you.  You line up in your Harold Carmichael fucking jerseys, and one at a time, you get all fucked  my dick.  You city of brotherly love, you bunch of fucking horses.  Fucking goddamn losers.  Just 52 fucking hours into a show.  The fuck am I going to do at this point?  You people on the goddamn acid.  Fucking be up here talking about Hitler.  That ain't going to work.  What do you want me to talk about? 
[03:57:30]  Say, throw out some talking.  Let's talk about heart disease.  Something you're all going to fucking die of, and I'm going to laugh at your fucking  puddles.  It's going to be great.  You're all going to get fucking cancer, which is fantastic, because all your fucking  heads are shaved anyways.  No one's even going to notice.  You're going to get fired for coming to work too late, because then I can notice that you  have fucking bone marrow cancer.  The only thing that's going to give it away is me laughing at you in the fucking background.  You fucking bunch of losers with your fucking cell phone pictures. 
[03:58:00]  Fucking suck a dick.  Fucking asshole.  11 more minutes to this.  I hope you all get in your fourth focuses.  You fucking drive off the side of that faggot ass Ben Franklin British.  You fucking one British heaven.  Piece of shit city that no one gives a fuck about.  The terrorists.  The terrorists will never bomb you people because you're fucking worthless and no one cares about you. 
[03:58:30]  You are this high above New Orleans.  No one gives a shit.  Feed off.  We'll never show up for you fucking assholes.  I hope your mother has herpes in the center of her asshole.  And you go home tonight and lick it and spit it on your tongue.  And some other horrific shit happens that involves cancer.  To all of you.  11 minutes left.  11 minutes.  I hope somebody takes a fucking beer stein and just slaps you on the back of your sit-in-fested 
[03:59:00]  fucking shoulders and your awful man-sit tank tops.  I hope that answers to you.  I hope the task fucking gliss into your fucking shoulder plate.  And then I see you afterwards.  Hey, how's it going?  Enjoy the fucking show.  That's great.  And I grab you by the fucking hair, but you don't have any.  They really have to come to this, people.  They really have to come to it. 
[03:59:30]  I really hope all of you run into all those black people that you love so much here in  Camden.  I really hope that happens.  I hope there's a line of all you guys getting fucking carjacked.  And they take out their big black dicks.  And they just shove her right in your fucking mouth.  Each and every one of you.  And somehow they just keep repeatedly coming, right in your fucking eyeballs.  Until it builds up so much that your eyes get fucking crushed over.  You can't see shit.  And somehow there's another dick in there for you to suck. 
[04:00:00]  Ten minutes left.  This is what you want.  This is what you want.  This is what you want.  This is what you're fucking.  You're fucking losers.  You're fucking Rocky.  This is your hero.  The whole pride of your city is built around a fucking guy who doesn't even exist.  You're fucking Joe Frazier is from there.  But he's black so you can't fucking deal with him.  So you make a fucking statue for some three-foot fucking Italian, you stupid. 
[04:00:30]  You're really cheesy eating fucking jackasses.  I hope that cheese melts your fucking faces off.  All of you collectively suck a fucking bitch.  A fucking booby.  Not even I hope it's going to do a fucking show.  You and your fucking Donovan McNabb shirt.  I hope he snapped both his fucking ankles.  The first goddamn game.  I hope you go home and fucking sick things.

This fucking Gerald Ford was in office.  Why don't you just get the fucking ice your face down there, you assholes.  I want you to notice the difference.  That fucking pussy team.

All of you motherfuckers.  I hope that bridge collapses onto your pathetic lives.  Don't fuck yourself.

You bunch of racist fucking morons.  Look at it.  What are you taking a picture of, Iran, huh?  This is the most.  I'm saying all the shit I wanted to say for 14 minutes.  This right here is the theme of my set.  A broken mic stand.  Three motherfucking minutes left.

Suck a dick.  Bring hunk of ground back from the dead, you fucking jackasses.  Maybe you'll win another one.  It ain't ever happening.  It ain't ever fucking happening.  With your red candy stripes, faggot fucking uniforms, your team should be selling cotton candy in the fucking instructional league. 
[04:04:00]  Do you have a soccer team?  That's all they got left, huh?  You got a fucking ping pong team?  Some other shit-ass fucking teams that are going to win a championship?

Goddamn lawn seats.  I'm actually getting fucking paid right now, people.  I'm getting paid to shit all over you guys and your stupid fucking rock t-shirts or bands that no one gives a fuck about.

You guys were phenomenal.  Oh no, I got four minutes left.  I got four fucking minutes left to fucking talk about you cunts.  That's not bad. 
[04:05:30]  That's not bad.  Twelve minute rand on this first time I said cunts.  That's a fucking record.  I'm going to finish my set by taking this mic stand base like a fucking disc.  I hope I hit a baby in the fucking head.  The one fucking kid who would actually go to chat, potless in his fucking trial.  What's that, sir?  The ancient bell.  Yes, he's not here.  I wish I was on his fucking call right now.  Maybe I wouldn't have a bunch of cunts.  Not fucking paying attention.

Coming out like a fucking Mexican with those two fucking crosses of bullets.  I just blow all your fucking brains out.  I would really enjoy blowing everybody's brains out.  I just fucking just, the next day somebody's mocking up the three pounds of fucking brains that are actually in this goddamn crowd.  One minute left in the period.

You're a little shitty-ass fucking subway.  And why don't you fucking build something for Joe Frazier and get that fucking idiot?  You guys all gonna go see Rocky 19?  Oh, dude, I think he can win.
