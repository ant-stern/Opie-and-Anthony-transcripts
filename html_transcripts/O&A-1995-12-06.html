<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with an announcement regarding a rescheduled Red Hot Chili Peppers concert.  This was quickly followed by a comedic phone call to a sex shop, where the hosts inquired about the availability of cock rings for various animals.  A listener-sponsored traffic report then aired, simply stating that "traffic sucks."  The show continued with a segment featuring a listener-submitted list of euphemisms for female genitalia.

Next, the hosts discussed Pamela Anderson's pregnancy and upcoming nude Playboy photoshoot. Opie surprisingly expressed attraction to pregnant women.  This led to the twice-played airing of Anthony's band's song, a profane parody of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer."  A female listener, claiming to be eight months pregnant, then called in, offering to pose nude for Opie. This sparked a discussion about creating a "Miss Pregnant America" contest.

Several subsequent calls revolved around the pregnant caller's offer and Opie's stated attraction to pregnant women, with Opie reiterating his serious interest.  The hosts also promoted a contest where listeners could win a Super Bowl trip by publicly displaying the station's call letters (WAF). The show concluded with a recounting of a past incident where Anthony was squirted with breast milk by a woman, causing him to flee the studio in fear.
