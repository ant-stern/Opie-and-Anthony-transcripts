<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, loosely connected but often circling back to recurring themes like their own show's production woes and the often offensive content of media they analyzed. The show began with a discussion of Dick Clark's death, touching upon his "America's oldest teenager" persona, his New Year's Eve broadcasts (including a perceived "Happy Do Year" mispronunciation), and critical analysis of celebrity reactions to his passing, deemed by the hosts as insincere.  This segment also involved comparisons of various years of Clark's New Year's Eve countdowns and a deep dive into the poor online promotion of SiriusXM celebrity interviews, contrasting their low viewership (Shaq, Gayle King, George Lucas, Ricky Gervais) with Jimmy Kimmel's successful approach.  Sam Roberts contributed significantly to this section.  The hosts interjected anecdotes about Artie Lange's bar fight, Barry Manilow and his dog, and a discussion of game shows like "Let's Make a Deal" and "$10,000 Pyramid," highlighting Dick Clark's perceived cockiness. The conversation drifted into racial discussions surrounding afros and racial perceptions of the 1960s and 70s, particularly relating to *American Bandstand*, reflecting on their own youthful anxieties about black culture and contrasting them with contemporary views.


The discussion then shifted to their own show's low online video viewership, specifically contrasting the poor performance of a George Lucas video with a surprisingly popular "Let's Make a Fucking Deal" segment. This led to a racist and misogynistic discussion about perceived racial biases in viewership and the portrayal of women on classic television shows.  They critiqued a fake Iron Sheik Twitter account making offensive comments about Dick Clark, briefly touched on a Mel Gibson tape, a news story about a child defecating in her pants, and a segment they called "Homeless Pyramid."  Significant time was spent complaining about their workplace at K-Rock, detailing technical problems, lack of management attention ("pay no mind list"), and studio setup difficulties.  Upcoming live events, including a show at the Hard Rock in Cleveland with an unconventional restaurant setting, were also discussed. The segment concluded with Opie's traffic ticket, leading to further complaints and digressions.


A substantial portion of the show focused on traffic tickets and a leaked Mel Gibson audio recording.  Rich Voss, a frequent contributor, shared anecdotes about evading tickets and aggressive traffic officers, recounting one instance where an officer jumped on his car's hood. The Mel Gibson recording, featuring anti-Semitic slurs and other offensive remarks directed at a collaborator on "The Maccabees," was played in excerpts, prompting discussion about Gibson's personality and the film's progress. Voss also discussed his strained relationship with his family, particularly his brother's leg amputation due to diabetes.  The show also included a discussion about the quality of shrimp platters and a recording of a Southwest Airlines pilot making offensive and boastful comments over an open microphone.


A segment featuring a recording of a pilot's offensive and misogynistic open-microphone rant took place,  with the hosts replaying portions and adding their own commentary.  Studio guest Rain Pryor (daughter of Richard Pryor) discussed her stand-up career and experiences growing up with her famous father, touching upon her relationship with him, his struggles, and her own challenges in the comedy world.  The conversation included mentions of other comedians like Eddie Murphy, Patrice O'Neal, and George Carlin.  Rich Voss was also present, and a phone segment included a caller engaging in a vulgar verbal altercation with a host.


Cousin Brucie, a radio personality, guested to share memories of Dick Clark, focusing on his broadcasting legacy and nurturing role with young performers.  He described Clark's on-air persona as trustworthy and dignified, contrasting it with the rebelliousness of early rock and roll.  Brucie highlighted Clark's business acumen, commitment to his beliefs (including his stance against racial segregation in music), and the intense media response following Clark's death. He recounted his experience hosting a five-hour radio show dedicated to Clark and concluded that Clark was irreplaceable.  The segment briefly included a humorous aside about a past encounter between Tippy Tom and Barry Manilow.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal.  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio, satellite radio.  Apparently, Opie and Anthony are dicks.  Oh, here they go again.  It's a fun, dopey radio show.  Not just any radio show.  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream.  The show is a lot funnier on any W.  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie.  Non-diversal teams.  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us.  It's just astounding to me. 
[00:00:30]  I didn't want to say it's racist, but goddamn.  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show.  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later.  There you go, all right?  We just lost our demo, man.  What's wrong with you?  You're just the last draw for the rocking radio duo.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I guess Dick Clark died.  Let's get it out of the way.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Everyone's like, I can't wait for the show tomorrow.  Dick Clark died.  I don't know.  Why?  We don't know what to do with that.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  We've made all the jokes over the years.  We've done it.  Oh, God.  I can't wait to listen tomorrow.  Yeah.  Dick Clark died.  I'm going to listen because they're going to goof on the dead guy.  I bet you they say Happy Do Year.  Say Happy Do Year.  Happy Do Year.  Happy Do Year.  Welcome aboard. 
[00:01:30]  Well, yeah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  I love how they've just mutated the whole America's oldest teenager thing on the news.  They were just calling him America's teenager, which is totally different.  He's known as America's oldest teenager.  Or was, anyway.  Because, you know, he got older, but he still was rocking, you know, rocking.  Oh, I thought that was because he looked good for his age for many, many years. 
[00:02:00]  Well, that was it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  But to me, I'm thinking, what are they talking about?  He's a middle-aged guy.  Yeah.  Well, now that we're at that point, we like to be considered old teenagers now, but.  Oh, boy.  I never thought he looked good for his age.  I thought he just looked like his age.  Yeah, not a teenager.  Right.  That's for sure.  But then on the news, they're like, oh, we've lost America's teenager.  It's like, no, that changes the whole context of it.  Right.  They call him the oldest teenager.  Was he influential, you think?  Yeah, I believe Dick Clark was quite influential to rock and roll. 
[00:02:30]  But why?  Because he got to say, and here's Elvis.  Yeah.  I don't like those type of DJs.  I was one of those DJs for a while.  I knew it was lame.  I knew it was lame when I was a music jock.  I'm like, anyone could do this.  But I'm gathering back in the 60s and 70s and whatnot, it was probably pretty cutting it.  You started in the 50s, I believe.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, he started in 1945 in the mailroom of a radio station. 
[00:03:00]  In upstate New York.  Yes.  And he worked his way up, much like our own young Sam Roberts.  Well, Sam's still America's oldest douchebag.  Yeah.  Sam's still close to the mailroom.  That's the problem.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Dick Clark moved way further on.  Yeah, see what Dick Clark did?  He didn't do a bunch of radio shows for free.  He put bands like Kiss on TV.  He put a lot of bands on TV, man.  Dick Clark did a lot for me.  Weren't they going to be on TV anyway?  That's my point.  I don't know. 
[00:03:30]  A lot of the bands weren't getting the shots back then.  Yeah, I don't know.  A lot of them credit Dick Clark, like, giving him their first shot.  Right.  Like, I know a lot of bands kind of have an affection for him.  And a lot of the Negro bands he brought on board were, uh...  The Negro.  Why are you laughing, Sam?  It's, uh...  That was the vernacular of the day.  They didn't say African-American back then, or even black.  They were called the Negro Acts.  Would come on, uh, Dick Clark's, um, American Bandstand.  The Coloreds.  And people would watch and go, holy shit. 
[00:04:00]  I had no idea they were Negroes.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Some of those bands people listened to because they thought they were white,  and then when they saw that they were Negroes, they had a problem, right?  Yeah.  And by the way, this American Bandstand song, sung, written and sung by...  I got it.  I got that voice.  Barry Manilow!  It's not a fucking Barry Manilow concert, people.  I got it, Sam.  I got it.  It is Barry Manilow. 
[00:04:30]  You can hear that Barry Manilow in there.  I didn't know that until today, by the way.  You know he had a dog named Bagel!  It was a Beagle named Bagel!  Tippi Tom.  How do we say this?  Might have had sex with Barry Manilow, but no one's ever going to believe him.  And now, you know, obviously, Tippi Tom's dead, so he can't tell anybody else.  Tippi Tom hanging out with Dick Clark right now.  Sure.  Talking about Barry Manilow and his Bagel Beagle Bagel. 
[00:05:00]  I guess I liked Dick Clark for a while there.  Did you watch American Bandstand?  Yeah, I was more of an American Bandstand guy than I was a Soul Train guy.  Of course.  You know, because I was white.  Because the Soul Train people didn't hide the fact that they were black.  No, Soul Train scared me.  It literally scared me.  I'd watch black people doing some very provocative dances for the time with giant afros, and it 
[00:05:30]  was quite frightening to a young white boy.  I never understood the afro.  Yeah.  When they cut that shit down, then I was a little more relaxed when I was around black people.  They all look like panthers back then.  We come from an age where those afros would scare the living shit out of you.  Oh, yeah, you see an afro coming.  How do you grow something like that?  And the afro pick that was stuck into the afro so they could take it out and pick their  hair or stab people.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it was frightening to me. 
[00:06:00]  You know the bandolier?  Yeah.  Some company should come up with the afro where you can put all your shit in.  You just shove your shit in the afro.  Yeah.  See, that's fucking scary.  Big Angela Davis afro-wearing motherfucker.  I just never understood that.  I tried, but I had fear.  Yeah.  In my soul.  It was fear.  When you came across the afro.  You know, being a child of the 80s, you do remember whether it was American Bandstand  or Soul Train.  You do?  There's a dog walker near my building that went old school and has the afro. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And she's young.  She can't be more than maybe, I don't know, 22, let's say.  I think she's like a college girl, maybe just out of college.  Yeah.  It is the fucking sexiest thing ever, man.  Yeah.  Because now I'm not scared of the afro.  And she's got it going on.  It's way out like this.  Like that?  Oh, easily.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little looser than that.  Lauren Hill?  No, that's not Lauren Hill, is it?  I have no idea.  Even though Lauren Hill did do the afro. 
[00:07:00]  I don't know if I'd like the afro.  It's too much hair.  It's too crazy.  Yeah.  I don't like a perm on a white chick.  I don't know if I'd like an afro.  The afro, if done right, is very sexy now.  It's all right.  Show me some afros that you guys keep getting into.  The only afro I ever want to see is on a velvet painting over the bed of a black gentleman.  Turned out to be assholes.  No, see, that's like, that's trimmed like a hedge.  Yeah, it is.  You kind of want it a little wild.  Give me a little wild one. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, wow, that is some crazy-ass black bitch right there.  She got the afro.  She all greased up in a bikini.  Yeah.  That's right.  Just let your soul, baby.  Feeling all so silky.  Just let it shine through.  Just let your soul.  Yeah.  Who sings this?  This is from Coming to America. 
[00:08:00]  From Coming to America, yeah.  I know, but who sings it?  I don't know if it's a real song.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Maybe it is.  No, it was for the commercial during the movie.  It was a product in the...  So glow.  I mean, you want...  All the grease would be there on the back of the chairs.  Like the mother, the father, and like the son or something.  Yeah.  And those three grease marks.  That was great.  Do you want to hear the first Clark Countdown and the last one?  Oh, boy. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's cool.  The guy carved his afro into a hat.  Where?  Oh, no.  Sam just had it.  Look at that.  Oh, really?  It's an afro hat.  Wow, that's cool.  A bill on the front of it.  How do you do that?  That's amazing.  It looks like wool.  It does.  I would hate that.  It does look like wool.  Michael Jackson, when he was black and had an afro.  Yeah, but his was shitty. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Look at it.  It's just shitty.  He had a big round afro when he was younger.  His afro looks like Janet from Three's Company.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll take a picture of this girl with the afro that's a dog walker.  Yeah.  And I'm telling you, I know how you think, but I think you might go, you know what?  That's all right.  Yeah.  When you take the picture, go, you don't want to show, I'm normally not attracted to you  people.  Yeah, yeah.  The reaction there. 
[00:09:30]  2011 countdown, is that the 2012 year, though?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  This was the last one, then.  Do you want to hear, like, which one was the bad year?  That was, like, the first year that he did it after his dilemma.  I think it's 2006, where we had the Happy Due Year one.  Really?  Because we've got to hear Happy Due Year.  Here's the first time he did the countdown in 1973.  You see the year 1973 just flashing briefly.  When it hits there, you can bet your bottom dollar, it'll be pandemonium. 
[00:10:00]  Not a follow.  Before it all happens, let me wish you the happiest of all New Year's.  Oh.  Watch out.  New Year.  Right now, Jenny Gump is running out of a room.  It is now 1973, as of now.  Ah, no countdown.  You didn't even count it down.  How about that?  Because he's like, that was it?  That was it.  And then who was, what the fuck was that? 
[00:10:30]  Oh, I can't, I don't remember that being, you know, the 80s.  And then 2004, I think, is when it started to kind of, this was the, maybe this was the  last time it sounded like something.  Oh, okay.  Yes, indeed.  It's getting closer and closer.  Count it down.  20.  19, 18, 17.  19, 18.  It's been around a long time.  We're going to get there.  Yes, indeed.  In 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1. 
[00:11:00]  How come a large crowd can't ever count down quickly?  Ah.  Wow, he sounded great there.  He sounded great, and he was 74 right there.  Wow.  Sounding great at 74 years old.  Oh, boy.  And then the stroke, and I think he took a year off.  Didn't he take a year off?  Yeah, Regis did one year.  And then back in 05, I think.  And then he came back in 06.  Ted died, 8, I don't even know what time it is.  Did he fill in? 
[00:11:30]  Regis filled in.  How do you know that?  Yes, because E-Rock just told me.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  The amazing E-Rock, as they call him.  Fucking E-Rock.  I mean, Regis fills in for everybody.  Yeah.  E-Rock remembers that because as they were lowering him down the big pole in Times Square.  He didn't see Dick Clark.  Sliding down the pole.  You got some more Afro-bloods.  Oh, boy.  I saw that one where she was naked.  You like that?  Oh, yeah.  She would ruin you.  God, she'd ruin you.  Would you go there, Ant?  You'd have to. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, you know what?  Ant didn't say no, by the way.  That doesn't look bad.  That doesn't look bad at all.  Yeah.  No.  And she's very black.  She looks very Hootie.  No, Tootsie.  She looks very Tootsie.  You're a fan of the Tootsies.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of the Hootie.  No, I know.  We learned that from Francine.  Yeah.  We're team Tootsie.  Yeah, I'm team Tootsie.  All right, so Dick Clark in 2006, here's the drop-off that made everyone sad. 
[00:12:30]  And then we were sad for many New Year's after this.  Many New Year's.  We're less than 30 seconds away from the big moment, and we're coming up in 20 seconds.  30 seconds.  There it goes.  They're waiting in anticipation.  Oh, what a little.  There we go now.  Look at her.  Oh.  All right.  There it goes.  Down she goes.  50, 40, 13, 12, 1, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
[00:13:00]  Happy 2006.  2006.  Where's Happy New Year?  Oh, God.  Where the fuck is Happy New Year?  Is Happy New Year one of those legends?  No, we heard Happy New Year.  There's so many things that people never really said.  I don't know if he ever said Happy New Year.  I remember mocking him one year on stage because I was at the Borgata doing the, and I was on 
[00:13:30]  a midnight, and part of the gig was doing the countdown.  I was at that.  Oh, you were there with Dick Clark's.  You got me on stage to help you out.  There's a bunch of us.  Oh, wow.  And then Artie beat the shit out of somebody like he was a lion tamer in the lounge.  Artie and Sherrod there, too, or just Artie?  It was Artie.  Artie's an animal.  Whatever.  We've told that story a few times, too.  He just took on half the lounge because these juice heads, as they like to say on the Jersey 
[00:14:00]  shore, thought Artie stole their vodka.  You're probably right.  But Artie goes, I guess back then, I don't know.  Oh, was he recovering back then?  He goes, I'm not even drinking.  And he got all pissed off, and these guys insisted, and then Artie picked up a chair like a lion  tamer and just fought all of them.  And then as the security guards are pulling him out of the place, he's off his feet.  They're pulling him out of the place.  He's waving to me and everybody else from the gig like it was no big deal. 
[00:14:30]  And then I'm thinking, this guy is going to be in jail.  And I saw him at breakfast the next day.  Like, it was nothing.  It was a real...  It happens.  And it was a real fight.  It wasn't one of these like, okay, everyone's cool.  Let's just move on.  It was a sick fucking fight.  Where's the Happy New Year, Iraq?  Try the next one.  We don't want to do this all day.  Jesus.  Could do it all day.  All right, we'll try it.  2007 might have been Happy New Year.  We're coming up on the new year in 30 seconds. 
[00:15:00]  The crowd is getting louder and louder.  We're about to say goodbye to the old year.  In 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Happy New Year.  That's not it either, Iraq.  Happy New Year. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, I think it's a legend.  I think it's an urban legend.  No, no, no, no.  He never said Happy New Year.  Strokes are awful.  Yeah, we kind of know that firsthand, don't we?  It's terrible.  It's funny, though.  Like, when you hear Dick Clark, as bad as it sounded, like, wow, he wasn't in shape.  Like, when you saw Patrice's stroke, like, all right, well, Dick Clark still lived.  I mean, it wasn't the quality of life he was used to.  Right.  It wasn't.  But he was still living a life and able to communicate and eat.  He probably lived a pretty okay life, too, considering, you know?  You see how much worse it could have been. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  You remember his Bleeps and Blunders, that show?  I kind of like it.  Practical Jokes, Bleeps, Blunders.  I kind of like that one.  Yeah.  With Ed McMahon, right?  Ed McMahon.  Also, remember Carol Burnett had that little tug-on-the-ear thing she would do when she left?  Dick Clark had one where he literally turned around and would grab the cheek of his ass  and give a little squeeze every time he would turn away to walk off stage as a little goodbye.  I don't know who it was to or what he was doing, but he would grab his ass and fucking walk 
[00:16:30]  about.  You could probably find...  Are you doing a bit?  No.  He actually grabbed his own ass.  Find a Dick Clark ass grab or something.  It's got to be something, right?  He'd grab his ass when he would leave.  Happy New Year was 2008.  2008?  Yes.  Who's saying that?  I am. 
[00:17:00]  Because I finally found it.  Oh, boy.  Because we've got to...  You know, instead of playing them all, we've got a montage.  We could go with a montage.  Can't find that?  Sam finds that.  We'll get back to that.  Yes, grab.  Sam will definitely find it.  Happy New Year.  Ah.  See, there's the Happy New Year.  That's Happy New Year.  Can I hear that again?  Oh.  Okay.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  And then...  Like, what happens to you when you make the New Year... 
[00:17:30]  Happy...  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Maybe his teeth are dry.  But...  What is the D?  His teeth are dry like...  Dry.  I don't know.  It's just so much fun to do...  Jimmy's characters.  All of your dumb fucking characters.  Just...  I'm obsessed with doing them all through the day after we're done with the show.  I do nothing but Jimmy Norton characters.  My ex and I are in kind of a fight on text. 
[00:18:00]  How do you fight with an ex?  No, we're still friends.  Because she got a job in a pot dispensary.  Nice.  Oh, wow.  It's illegal out there.  Yes.  Illegalized shit.  Yeah.  But Edgar has been texting her that she's no longer allowed to talk to Jelly because she's  a potty.  A potty.  And a drug dealer.  She's very upset.  A drug dealer.  Yeah, Edgar's been fucking getting rid of the business.  That's funny.  Here's the mantis.  Happy 2004! 
[00:18:30]  Happy 2006!  Happy New Year!  Happy New Year!  Happy New Year!  Happy New Year!  Happy New Year!  You know, it's funny.  You hear it like that?  That one bad year?  One bad year with Happy New Year.  Beautiful.  I asked, are these the good ones?  Every time a celebrity dies, other celebrities feel like they have to say something, I don't 
[00:19:00]  know, what's the word?  They have to kind of be...  Poignant?  Poignant and reflective.  Reflective.  And it just turns out to be so douchey.  Oh, no.  Douchey.  Rest in peace, Dick Clark.  New Year's Eve will never be the same.  Oh.  Who wrote that?  David Boreanaz.  We're not wanting to stream it on July 6th.  No.  We're changing it.  Why wouldn't New Year's be the same?  Why wouldn't it be the same?  I think it's going to be a little happier.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:19:30]  But no one wants to talk about that.  I tweeted every year for the last five or six years how depressing it was to watch him  on New Year's Eve.  It was depressing.  It did get a little depressing.  And everyone watched because they were like, oh, let's see how he handles it this year.  It was kind of a freak show at the end.  It really was.  Joan Rivers.  Very sad to hear about Dick Clark.  What a great life.  What a great career.  Relevant until the end.  He will be missed.  That one isn't as bad.  No.  I wonder if he put Joan on TV at one point, too. 
[00:20:00]  He might have helped her at one point.  Seth Green, so saddened by Dick Clark's passing.  An innovator.  A legend.  A man who believed in the greatness of humans.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What does that mean?  Thank you.  Thank you for what?  Thank you.  What's the greatness of humans?  What's he talking about?  I don't know, man.  What is he talking about is the best.  Did Michael Moore say anything since in Bowling for Columbine, he just fucking walked up  and started harassing him in that van? 
[00:20:30]  Remember that?  Yeah.  Dick Clark's like, shut the door.  Close the door.  Michael Moore.  When Michael Moore does his very somber, like, Mr. Clark, do you know there are people  that are working very hard, single mothers taking a bus?  Shut up.  I hate the somber Michael Moore when he looks like he's sad talking to people.  What a phony baloney.  Okay, here we go.  These are the ones that I hate. 
[00:21:00]  Found a good one.  Who's Sean Ryan?  Sean Ryan.  These are celebrity tweets about Dick Clark.  Hope Dick Clark's somewhere.  Here we go.  Are you ready for the somewhere?  Somewhere.  Oh, no.  I hate when they speculate where he is.  You know where he is?  The morgue.  Hope Dick Clark's somewhere spinning a hip new single for the kids and ringing in the  new year.  Why would he be doing that now?  Why?  Is every night New Year's Eve in heaven?  What did that say again?  In the magical place in the clouds? 
[00:21:30]  Hope Dick Clark's somewhere spinning a hip new single for the kids and ringing in the  new year.  Who said that?  Why do people do that?  Honestly.  First of all, that means the kids are dead.  If he's spinning a single for the kids, they're dead.  For dead kids is what you're saying.  I hope a guy who lived 82 years is spinning a record for someone who lived 13 and fucking  died.  And died.  Meth overdose.  And heaven is going to work every day?  Yeah, that's heaven. 
[00:22:00]  Do you guys want to do a show in heaven every single day?  Guess what?  In heaven, I don't want to be doing this shit.  Anything but.  And I bet you Dick Clark is the same way.  Working.  Especially with the trashing management.  I wouldn't want that in heaven.  But why do people do that?  I understand.  You know, when Patrice passed, we were all bummed out and stuff, but we didn't like get  hokey with it, I don't think.  Yeah, I don't think I wanted him up there to laugh.  He just died.  It stinks.  It sucked.  Plus, he wouldn't want to be performing every single day up there. 
[00:22:30]  No.  Kings of Leon.  Who was Sean Ryan, by the way?  I don't know.  What's his Twitter name?  It don't matter then.  Fuck it.  One of the Kings of Leons writes, R.I.P.  Dick Clark.  Say it ain't so.  Say it ain't so.  It's a surprise?  Say it ain't so.  It is, but.  It is.  It's, it's, it's, one of the community people, Yvette Nicole Brown, heartbroken, nothing  else to say.  Sad face.  Nothing else to say.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:23:00]  Why are you heartbroken?  You didn't know the guy?  Don't say anything.  Boy.  Let's see.  NBC News, Chuck Todd.  Ugh, Chuck Todd.  You don't like him?  No.  I am still amazed that Dick Clark was only 82.  What a career.  Of course he looked 49 for 25 years.  America's oldest 49-year-old.  He was only 80. 
[00:23:30]  Does that mean like he looked really old at the end?  Yeah.  That's not a nice thing to say.  Yeah, he looked 45 until he looked dead.  That's a lovely tweet.  Debbie Gibson, just heard about Dick Clark.  Oh man, so sad.  I don't think it's sad when someone makes it in their 80s.  It's in their 80s.  We're all gonna die, man.  That's some problems.  You get into your 80s, I don't think it's that sad.  Especially since he had the big stroke and then had several years after that.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  As opposed to other people who have a stroke and are just dead in a month because they can't  move. 
[00:24:00]  Good point.  Still got to host his show.  Exactly.  He's taking a nice, fun New Year's Eve gig.  I Twittered something.  I said, I guess God needed records.  Records?  God needed records.  I'm sure you get the radio in heaven from here.  See, this is a good tweet.  It's Jimmy Kimmel.  He writes, I had the pleasure of working with Dick Clark many times.  Great guy.  And then he writes some trivia.  Did you know he hated music? 
[00:24:30]  That's good.  Right?  Who wrote that one?  Jimmy Kimmel.  That is funny.  Goddamn that Jimmy Kimmel's funny.  He's smart, too, because he uses the web and stuff like that.  Jimmy Kimmel throws out clips to YouTube.  They become viral.  Of course he does all the time.  And then it comes back and helps out the show because then you're turning on new people  and now they're watching Jimmy Kimmel on a regular basis. 
[00:25:00]  I've been trying to tell these guys forever.  Oh, they don't get it.  We have the web in here.  A cobweb, right?  Am I right, guys?  That's not funny.  That's wordplay.  Oh, Jesus.  But good news.  We're talking about a podcast, which means if we're still around in October, then wait  another year and maybe eventually we'll do it.  But we're talking about it.  Yeah.  Because I said, look, you throw an hour of O&A on the podcast.  The podcast world is blowing up so we can be in that world.  You give them a taste like a drug dealer.  Give them an hour.  And you're going to turn people on to the show.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  We'll talk about it for a while.  Turn people on to the show.  By the way, it'll never happen is what my point is.  Jimmy Kimmel's got a visual element, though.  Yeah.  Well, he has a visual element.  That's true.  Well, every once in a while we get people that tape our interviews and then they put  it on a website that no one goes to.  So that's pretty good.  That's a visual element.  That's pretty good, though.  Did they put...  Let me ask you a question.  I don't know.  The interviews that we tape with celebrities.  Yeah.  Did they put them on YouTube or something?  No.  Why would they?  No, they only put it on their site because they want to control everything and no one 
[00:26:00]  goes to their site on a regular basis.  Yeah.  That's the last interview.  Shaq, Aziz.  Oh.  Aziz was at least a month ago.  I know they're working on a Ricky Gervais.  How are they...  How does it work?  What's it working on?  What are you talking about?  When...  You know, I film every once in a while.  It's up within hours.  What are they working on?  What's to work on from last Friday?  I don't know if they do it for...  Oh, God.  Not today.  I don't want to be fucking pissed off today.  Maybe I shouldn't even tell you.  What?  Don't do it to me, Stan.  I don't know if they do it for...  What are they working on? 
[00:26:30]  It's an interview.  It's like you find a quick 30 seconds that was kind of cool and you throw it up there immediately.  I cannot confirm that they do this for videos.  But I know for audio clips, when we do it through our publicity departments...  Did you hear that?  What happened?  You all right?  My stomach was growling.  It just went...  That's an inside fart.  You might be a photo of a cock on the screen.  Delicious treat.  What happened, Sam?  For audio, I know they run it through... 
[00:27:00]  Legal?  Yeah.  And they contact publicists and make sure everybody's okay with it before it goes up.  Don't they sign that when they fucking sign the thing?  You think?  Yes.  All right.  So why would they need to do that?  They don't want to get anybody upset.  Oh, my God.  Please.  Seriously.  We got to leave here.  All right?  We have to leave here.  And we got to...  I'll build a studio in New York so we get the celebrities and we'll fucking podcast our  asses off.  We have to do this. 
[00:27:30]  Why would they do that?  If a celebrity comes in and signs paperwork, it's all good.  And by the way, the stuff that the celebrities might be a little pissed off about is the stuff  that the viewers, the listeners would want to see.  Now, what did they not like to put up there?  I don't know.  It's never been the case that I've heard anything get specifically turned down.  I just know that that's the vetting process for audio.  Why isn't Gervais up immediately?  Ricky Gervais should have been up immediately.  Oh, exactly.  He is a massive A-lister.  I also know that their web team is... 
[00:28:00]  Horrible?  It's not horrible.  It's just shitty.  Very small.  Small.  Small.  They literally...  They're probably overwhelmed with the entire company.  Yeah.  How about this?  I'm a small, like, guy.  I get my fucking stuff up there.  There's maybe two people who film for the entire platform.  All right.  But what are they doing aside from putting Ricky Gervais up on the side?  What's more important than that?  The guy just was filming with Jerry Seinfeld for Jerry's new show.  What new show?  Oh, what?  I didn't know that.  Jerry's got some kind of new show. 
[00:28:30]  Well, how about you put your people that you've seen around, I didn't say friends, in at me.  Not you.  What do we got?  Well, they put Gervais on their YouTube stuff, but not on our actual website.  Wait, so there is a YouTube site?  Yeah.  If you go to YouTube slash Sirius or Sirius.  How many users have?  So they could just link it to there or something.  Why haven't they?  Wait, how many views does Gervais have?  100.  Yeah, because no one knows.  No one knows that even exists.  Dude, I throw a video of Jimmy farting at those 30,000, 40,000. 
[00:29:00]  Like, it's nothing.  Oh, dear Lord.  They only have 100 views on the Ricky Gervais.  Because they don't know how to market.  They don't know how to do shit.  Oh, dear Lord.  They don't know how to do shit.  It did just go up yesterday afternoon.  So maybe.  Dude.  Yeah, but.  That 100 views?  Yeah.  100.  100.  My dumb videos, and they're dumb, do 5,000 overnight easy.  And this is a Ricky Gervais interview.  He was in my seat.  Yay, Ricky.  Yes, he was.  He was sitting right there. 
[00:29:30]  Maybe we could tweet about it.  But why aren't they promoting it properly?  You're hysterical.  Every other Ricky Gervais video does, you know, some of them, hundreds of thousands of views.  There's a competition now someone sent me a link to in England, like the best British comic of all time.  Yeah.  And right now, I don't know a lot of the guys.  Some of the guys, I know who they are.  And he's number one right now.  Stephen Merchant is number two.  Again, I don't know if that will last.  I forget who number three is.  Jimmy Carr, who I know, I've done festivals with, is funny. 
[00:30:00]  That's Stephen Carr.  Jimmy Carr is a funny fuck, man.  If he's ever around, we should put him on.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Very good.  I didn't realize how fucking famous he was.  Yeah.  It annoys me.  I watched a moment of his special.  He has a special.  It's an hour and 40 minutes.  Wow.  And he's got like six of them.  Really?  Who does that kind of time?  Let me.  Howard, that's crazy.  And they're also putting up Kevin Hart, and they're going to put up John Cusack, too.  On the site that gets 99 views?  What about Jeff Goldblum?  Yeah, they were in here. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, they were in here for that.  He's a huge A-lister.  When is that going up?  When is the Ricky Gervais going up on their website?  Why don't they all just go up?  Yes.  Why don't they just put them all up?  Because they truly suck at marketing.  They do want to control everything.  They do want to control everything.  Their YouTube site, run through the views on these videos for me.  Okay.  This is laughable.  I did a dumb video of Jimmy getting punched by Rashad Evans.  It's pushing 20,000 views, and we haven't even really pushed it.  Right.  We haven't even pushed it.  Give me some views on some big celebrities that SiriusXM filmed. 
[00:31:00]  Gayle King talking about Trayvon Martin.  You would think that would be a fucking huge video, right?  How many views so far?  1,000 over the past two weeks.  That's horrendous.  Oh, Gayle King talking about Trayvon Martin and Jay-Z.  Right.  376 over the past two weeks.  Ah, big drop off.  All right.  What about our Shaq interview?  I see that's up there.  Wow.  Over two weeks?  Mm-hmm.  830.  That is horrendous. 
[00:31:30]  That is horrendous.  Somebody should be fired.  It's terrible.  Somebody should be fired.  Dude, that's making me angry.  It's so terrible.  I do marketing on the side for the show when I can, and I blow this shit away.  And that's not even my expertise.  Whoever is in charge of this should be fired.  I'm not even joking.  I've watched the Shaq video about 600 times.  How about Donald Sutherland?  That was a huge interview.  For a huge movie, by the way, Hunger Games.  How many?  There's two of them.  Okay.  The one about him talking about Animal House has 3,900. 
[00:32:00]  Animal House.  Ooh.  That's not three weeks.  Don't even start.  That's not even good, believe it or not.  That's not even good.  No, it's terrible.  The one talking about Hunger Games is 3,400.  Oh.  All right.  Who else of significance is on their site?  And that's a guy who's in a general blockbuster, a genuine blockbuster.  Who are those guys?  Are they, uh...  Well, that's One Direction.  I mean, that's got...  Oh, yeah.  That's got...  This one has 700,000 views.  Yeah, but that...  That's One Direction.  That goes beyond marketing.  What is One Direction?  They're the hottest pop...  They're a big boy band.  They're the hottest boy band around. 
[00:32:30]  Are they?  Oh, wow.  I've got to try to get tickets for my niece and it's not happening.  What are they here?  They're about mine.  Who did George Lucas talk to?  Bill Bradley?  Bill Bradley has a radio show here?  Yeah.  Who?  Basketball guy?  He's a bore.  Bill Bradley, senator.  You ever hear him talk?  He's a bore.  Bill Bradley smells badly.  You ever see what's happening?  Mr. Bradley smells badly?  They got...  Raj and D got in trouble.  When George Lucas talking about Red Tails and Star Wars, it's George Lucas. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Boy, how many?  Over the course of one month.  Yeah.  393.  Two fantasy movies.  You had George Lucas in here.  Two fantasy movies.  You had George Lucas in here.  You filmed him.  And after two months, it's only 400 views.  Out of 400 views.  Wow.  Another one, it says, George Lucas, Star Wars written to the technology, has 1,000 views  over the course of a month.  Whoever's in charge of this should get fired.  I'm not even joking about it.  It's truly terrible. 
[00:33:30]  It's horrendous.  You're not doing it properly.  I'll tell you what it is.  It's lazy.  What I mean by lazy is mentally it's lazy because it's putting it up, it's going through  the physical, and then leaving it and doing nothing for it.  That's why Kimmel's a smart dude because his show feels relevant because he uses these  weird clips, and guys who are obsessed with the computer will see things online and then  see him on Kimmel, and it just feels like he's living in the world today.  Now, you take SiriusXM, you put it up against Kimmel, it's equal in a way, okay, as far  as exposure goes. 
[00:34:00]  So go to Jimmy Kimmel's YouTube channel to prove our point.  Well, I was just going to say Stephen Merchant getting unmasked a month ago.  He has 94 views.  Stephen Merchant.  94 views.  And meanwhile, 94 views.  Oh, this one's more, Rich Voss getting unmasked, has 78 views, which, I mean, for Voss isn't  bad.  Holy shit.  Dude, Stephen Merchant's number two in that British poll.  Like, the fact that you can't get people in England to watch a Stephen Merchant in-depth  interview.  Right, because they don't know how to work it. 
[00:34:30]  They don't tag them right either.  They don't know how to work it, and they don't know how to feed them.  You've got to feed the machine.  Here's Jimmy Kimmel's YouTube page.  Now, give me some of his.  Oh.  No, their job either.  Wow, what the fuck?  Whoa, these are all from five hours ago.  Well, yeah.  Maybe that's why.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Okay, all right.  Never mind.  Yeah, yeah.  Those.  No, because, and people make fun of me when I put a video up, like, oh, only 301 views 
[00:35:00]  so far.  It's like, no, that's where YouTube stops their counter for some reason, and then they catch  up like 12 hours later.  His interview with Mark Harmon from one day ago has 4,500 views already.  And no one cares about Mark Harmon.  No one gives a turkey, excuse my French.  Gavin DeGraw, Opie, your guy from Dancing with the Stars.  Love this guy.  7,000 from a day ago.  Gary Busey Tax Tips from two days ago has 9,700.  See, that's a funny idea.  Like, he has, I heard he had Oldman read something in the Jersey Shore synopsis or something in 
[00:35:30]  his best Shakespearean accent.  That's really good.  He has some creative thinkers that work for him, man.  We're just scared to ask the celebrities that come in here to do anything different.  To do anything extra.  Because they usually just go, eh, nah, nah, nah, nah.  They're also more likely, honestly, in fairness to us, A, we are a little lazy.  We don't think of it.  I mean, then B, they're more likely to do it on TV than they are on radio.  Yeah, they also, like, when they do Jimmy Kimmel, you have them there.  Like, when they're here to do our show, they're also here to do 100 other shows. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, and they just take TV more seriously.  More importantly, thank you to Ratspeak for Vegas.  There's a video called How to Change Wiper Blades on YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  That has 2.4 million views.  Oh, there you go.  That's great.  That's nice.  You don't think the web team here does the right?  They're horrendous.  They really are horrible.  Horrible.  I'd film so much more, but I'm part of the show, so I do what I can.  Yeah.  Sometimes I'm asking questions and I'm holding a camera up because I don't trust these guys to do the right thing. 
[00:36:30]  But my shit is current, at least.  They're still working on the Ricky Gervais video.  Well, that one's done.  I was wrong about that.  It's not up on SiriusXM, though.  It's on the YouTube page.  But it should be on SiriusXM.  It's not on our website.  Their main website.  It should be there, front and center.  And then they should push people to that site to see the video.  Yeah, whatever.  I made my money.  I don't give a fuck.  I really don't give a fuck. 
[00:37:00]  Sounds like you give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  Jason Alexander, Ann, about Dick Clark.  Oh, yes, yes.  Mr. Clark, you brought us the soundtrack of our lives.  Does dead Dick Clark follow Jason Alexander?  Is his Twitter following?  Can he see that?  Is he unblocked or anything?  Dead Dick Clark?  You know.  Why would you write something?  Oh, like you're trying to say Mr. Clark's not hearing these?  I don't think he's reading.  Why are people calling him Mr. Clark now that he did? 
[00:37:30]  No one called him Mr. Clark.  It was just, hey, Dick.  He was always Dick Clark.  Yeah.  Mr. Clark.  You brought us the soundtrack of our lives.  Yes.  Thank you.  Mr. Clark, tear down that wall.  This is the douchiest one.  Jason Alexander, you know, the guy that was funny on Seinfeld.  Fucking George Costanza, one of the greatest sitcom characters ever.  But, Ann, brought to our attention, not a funny guy whatsoever.  I want to stop following him, but I can't.  Why?  Because I don't want to remember George Costanza as Jason Alexander through his tweets, because 
[00:38:00]  they're awful.  Are they bad?  But I've got to read them, because they're awful.  I don't know why I do that to myself.  I don't read his Twitter.  What's that one?  His last tweet was, lunch with my pal Martin Short.  It doesn't get more fun.  I bet it does.  Oh, I bet it does.  It's a blowjob with my pal Scarlett Johansson.  Much better than lunch with my pal Martin Short. 
[00:38:30]  So, Jason Alexander, there is more to his tweet.  This is the worst one so far.  We might have to give him the title.  Mr. Clark, you brought us the soundtrack of our lives.  Thank you.  Hope you're jamming with the best.  I don't think Dick Clark jammed with anybody.  No, he just played records.  He played records.  He introduced bands.  He didn't play with them.  These guys want to have a connection to the guy.  They never had a real connection with him when he was alive.  I don't think he was jamming.  How about the Jonas Brothers? 
[00:39:00]  Oh, well.  They got a lot of followers.  Oh, those young kids and their rock and roll music.  You'll continue to be an inspiration to us all, Dick Clark.  Inspiration for what, though?  Thanks for the amazing years you were with us.  You'll truly be missed.  The amazing rockin' years.  Yeah.  Rockin'.  You missed the biggest part.  Oh, you're right.  Thanks for the amazing rockin' years.  Rockin' years.  What is that?  Forgi? 
[00:39:30]  Forgi, yeah.  Forgi.  The Jonas Brothers.  Snoops actually wasn't bad.  Most of them aren't that bad, but then you get something like Jason Alexander and a few others.  You're smokin' a big blunt up there.  Ha!  Oh, smokin' up.  Is he gonna do a hologram of Dick Clark for New Year's Eve?  Snoop Pro, rest in peace to the Dick Clark.  You were a pioneer and a good man. 
[00:40:00]  Thank you, sir.  He'd have a pie in his ear.  Did he really, though?  It's very strange to have that.  It's not that mean.  Oh, sorry.  Bravo to Peter Stiff from Minnesota.  He writes, what did the Strokes say?  Oh, my goodness.  Well, there's a band called the Strokes, and I'm sure they would have had something to  say about the passing of Dick Clark.  Gotcha.  Ba-da-da-da-da.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da.  Ta-da-da-da-da.  Ta-da-da-da-da. 
[00:40:30]  Ah, there it is.  Thank you.  Hey, Doc Bagel is big.  See, we come full circle.  We should bring up the $10,000 pyramid.  All right.  He was the host of the game show.  Ah, there it is.  Oh, this is a horrible music.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  This reminds me of being home from school, though.  Yes.  Yes, it's very cool.  Yeah, it does.  Remember having a fever and watching this?  Oh, it's great.  You're so right.  I loved having a fever when I was a kid. 
[00:41:00]  And the Brady Bunch.  Yeah, you're just laying on the couch with a blanket on you.  Yeah.  Some medicine on the fucking coffee table.  Remember that?  Those horrendous fevers, but you had this to keep you company.  And you wouldn't sleep in your bed.  Your mom or my mom would set me up nice on the couch.  Got to be on the couch, yeah.  All nice for the day.  That's what the TV was.  It felt a little special while the rest of my brothers and sisters were at school.  You know what made me feel like I missed school was the, what was the one with Bob Barker?  Price is Right.  Oh, Price is Right.  That one really made me, because that was like 11.30 in the morning, and that made you start 
[00:41:30]  to feel like you were in afternoon.  Yeah.  So by the time that was over, you usually felt a little bit better.  And you're like, oh no, I can't go out for the rest of the day.  Like, that was like getting into the I fucked up place.  I fucked up.  You're like, shit, I got off of school, but now school would have been over, and now I  can't do anything.  That was the switchover where you started to feel after lunch, like, oh shit.  Ideally, at three, you're like, all right, cool, my sick day's over.  Now I want to go do my shit outside.  I'm out of here, yo.  No, I have to fucking fake it all the way to nighttime. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  It was always a quandary.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You miss the school, but you don't get to do all the cool shit.  Yeah, it's a trade-off.  Did you say you watched the $10,000 Pyramid or $25,000 Pyramid?  Well, $25,000 for me.  That was you?  Yeah, because I'm a child of the 80s.  I know what you're getting.  It's called the Pyramid.  Okay.  I watched the $25,000.  Why?  Well, $10,000 Pyramid was definitely the 70s, not the 80s.  Not only the 70s.  Like early 70s. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, fuck.  But I think Ant brought it to our attention that Dick Clark was a cocky son of a bitch  when he had all the answers in front of him and made believe he just kind of knew everything.  Yeah, he'd sit there.  What they would do is, you know, you'd have to describe something without using the actual  term or there were some other rules.  And then your back is to the Pyramid.  And then the person would see the word and have to give you clues.  It was a hard game.  It was very hard.  And Dick Clark would be like, okay, don't turn around. 
[00:43:00]  Don't turn around.  He goes, so you passed on that one.  Let's, uh, what if I would have said a car, uh, tires.  Things Ted Kennedy uses to kill women with.  I like this game.  It's like, well, first of all, he had the whole fucking time to think about it.  He knew the answer.  Right.  He's fucking telling clues.  And it's like, why am I sitting here still taking clues with my back turned for nothing?  Right.  I'm not going to make any money now.  Yeah, it don't matter anymore.  Now you're just fucking with me.  Right.  Let me go backstage and eat some of the buffet. 
[00:43:30]  I'm out of here.  Yeah, yeah.  You're so right.  As Sandy Duncan fucking sits there and goes, oh, I'm sorry.  Sandy Duncan's still walking away with a paycheck.  Sure.  And what, I?  Yeah.  Oh, uh, yes, Mr. Rock.  That was another staple for Charles Nelson Riley.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  Charles Nelson Riley was on there a lot.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Ah, delicious things.  A penis, cum, testicles.  Oh, yeah.  He's gay.  He's so gay. 
[00:44:00]  But no one really knew.  People were just weird back then.  Pleasurable things.  A penis in the ass.  Poppers.  Amel nitrate poppers.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  It was my ghost and Mrs. Muir money.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  That was a show he did.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh.  Da, da, da, da, da.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba,  $25,000 pyramid from 1987.  Wow, he did that show for a while, too, huh? 
[00:44:30]  Child thereof.  Oh, God, then it wasn't that $25,000 one for me.  It was the $10,000.  $10,000?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know when they bumped it up to $25,000.  Then wasn't there a $50,000 pyramid?  Yeah, it might have been.  Something like that.  How do we bring that back?  We should bring that back.  Yeah.  Ryan Seacrest gets to do all that shit now.  I don't like when they do the fucking old game shows and bring them back with new hosts.  It just looks weird, right?  Game Show Network?  You know what they do?  They just recently brought back...  Press Your Luck. 
[00:45:00]  Did they bring Press Your Luck back?  Oh, yeah, but you can't cheat anymore.  That board is all sorts of fucked up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They fixed that shit.  Family Feud again, too.  They brought...  Well, Family Feud never went away.  They just kept changing the host and stuff.  But they...  What the fuck was that one?  Oh, Let's Make a Deal.  Oh, right.  They brought back, which is the dumbest fucking show.  With Wayne Brady, right?  Wayne Brady hosted.  We just passed on that Wayne Brady.  Why would you say that?  Because fuck Wayne Brady.  When he was really huge, he didn't come in here.  Now he needs us.  And I honestly think...  Oh, we don't need you, sir. 
[00:45:30]  Fuck a list for Wayne Brady.  Write it down, Sam.  I honestly think on that show, Let's Make a Deal now, I think they have costumes and they  just give people...  No, why?  Because some asshole is overthinking that, too, and going, you know, it just doesn't look  right.  We gotta...  Yeah.  We gotta make this look cooler.  Like in the old one...  You just dressed up.  It looked damn well, people showed up at the television studio wearing wacky, outrageous  fucking costumes to get noticed.  How do you know there are costumes that they give them? 
[00:46:00]  I don't know.  There's some that just look bad, like they look like it's...  Like that?  Like Lollipop Lady?  She might have come with that.  Yeah.  That's kind of silly.  You're supposed to be a hemorrhoid.  Nice to meet you, Marilyn.  Now, Marilyn, welcome to the show.  Marilyn, stop bouncing, sweetheart.  Stop.  Marilyn, just...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Please.  No, no, no.  Stop, stop, stop.  Really.  It's getting a little...  The show could cancel, Marilyn.  You have to...  It's punctuous.  Really?  She's got big boobies back.  You see, Marilyn, I'm not even playing, huh?  I'm not even playing.  I don't want to go back to dancing on the sidewalk.  Nice fat tits, Marilyn.  Yeah.  Nice big lollipop tits. 
[00:46:30]  And that's like a show that you can't really bring back.  It's got 41,000 views, by the way.  I know.  Chick with tits in a fucking lollipop.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Let's Make a Deal was a show that was kind of for that time.  It's just some kind of wacky thing.  People aren't going to dress up to come to a stupid TV show and win fucking salad dressing.  I know it has the funniest joke about Let's Make a Deal.  The shit that Monty Hall would always want.  Was that the one?  Monty Hall?  Yeah, yeah.  They would never have.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, at the end, he'd come out.  Anybody got any turtle shit? 
[00:47:00]  Miss, like, anyone got any turtle shit in their purse?  I'll give you $10 if you have a needle, like, 25 if it's got AIDS in it.  I remember that joke from, like, 92.  Nice.  Fucking Otto.  That is really.  Otto and George on Twitter.  Turtle shit in your purse.  I wouldn't be surprised if they hand out shit to people, too, now.  Oh, yeah.  Put this in your purse.  We might be calling this item.  We don't know.  Yeah.  Like that Wonder Woman costume.  I'm not buying that.  I think they just found a girl.  Oh, God, I wouldn't fit you.  You're an asshole. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, boy, Chip.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I guess that's about it for Dick Clark.  Oh, my God.  We hardly knew you.  Is that Monty Hall?  They brought him out for the.  Where.  How does he look?  Oh, boy.  He doesn't look that bad, though.  He doesn't look all that bad.  He looks all right.  Remember him on The Odd Couple?  He was Oscar's friend.  Sixth decade of making deals.  Mr. Monty.  He's walking up those stairs.  It's like a hunchback.  Wow.  He looks great. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, what the fuck?  It's just his hair looks.  Oh, boy.  So much fun to hear.  It's a joy.  It's a pleasure.  It's a pleasure having you.  He does look good for that old.  So much fun watching you be the show.  I'm enjoying you.  What?  I never thought they'd replace me with a colored.  I swear to God.  Just because he's old.  I know.  I'm thinking like.  Because he's old school.  It's another time.  You do a good job, boy.  Yeah.  Old 1960.  I'm going to let you do what you do, which is what you did before I did it.  So I'm going to watch you do what you do over there.  Ladies and gentlemen, Money Hall. 
[00:48:30]  Let's see if he can still do it.  Money Hall.  How old is Money Hall?  He's got it.  He's in his 80s.  He can do something.  Does he go with you?  Come then.  Come on.  He's working it.  He's sharp as a tack.  Maybe we have more room up here if we just head over here.  Because this allows Jonathan to come down with something.  African-American couple.  Oh, they're bringing down a little game board that they used to do right in the aisle there.  They would play their little games.  Jonathan, did you grow a couple of inches since yesterday?  I'm also wearing my heels. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, I see my high heels.  I'm going to do that from now on.  Now, Jonathan's brought down a money board here.  It's a very interesting money board.  Oh, boy.  What happens to old people?  They just can't talk anymore.  13 of them have money.  And two of them do not have money.  I want to see if they win the money.  It's so visual, though.  It's so visual.  How come we can't just show up?  Oh, that's right.  Why do you do this to me?  The visual media.  You know the listeners don't want to hear me bitch.  Well, that's a fair point to bitch about that. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, right.  That's a fair point.  Fair point.  Fair point.  Yeah, we bitch about some stuff that's like, all right, but that's a fair point.  Oh, God.  The web team has to go.  A new car!  By the way, this Make a Deal?  Yeah.  46,000 views.  46,000 views for Let's Make a Fucking Deal.  And no one thinks about Let's Make a Deal anymore.  Not even the old ones.  This is the new ones.  Who cares?  The Wayne Brady ones.  Yeah, the Wayne Brady ones.  We had George Lucas and how many views?  Like 300 or something?  Yeah.  It's the fucking Star Wars guy. 
[00:50:00]  It's actually talking about Star Wars.  Just talking about Star Wars.  Let's make a baby.  That'd be a great show.  Yeah.  Let's make a baby.  Yeah.  This is what I say today.  Quickly.  Instead of half these idiots just staring at the stock price all day long.  How about you look into what's going on around here?  Yeah.  How about you check people's work?  A George Lucas video should have more than 400 views.  They were zonked right off the bat?  Yeah.  That's not right.  It's because they're black, right? 
[00:50:30]  Yep.  That's a racist fucking show.  They just want the blacks to sit back down.  Yeah.  They want white people to win more money.  Stop showing up here.  Yeah.  Oh, look who we got on TV.  Talk about our love for rock and roll.  Uncle Brucey.  Cousin Brucey.  We like Cousin Brucey.  Oh, Cousin Brucey.  And everybody to a man or a woman said, this is the nicest guy.  The common denominator was a sweet, caring.  Cousin Brucey.  It's just a big, nice, thick head of hair.  And if he needed something, he would go ahead.  It's too dick clark.  It looks freshly dry cleaned. 
[00:51:00]  The guy we knew at our home that we felt was a friend of ours.  It's just his dog.  Oh, man.  It's going to poke its little head out.  Look at how curly it is on top and how straight it is on the side.  It's horrible.  He was a brilliant producer.  He had a great eye.  He ran a bunch of award shows, game shows, New Year's Eve show.  He was smart.  Yeah, Cousins.  What?  He was one of the very first on a national level.  And he decided when he was on the road with his caravan. 
[00:51:30]  I just kind of Brucey always sounds like he has a cold.  He does, yeah.  Why, though?  He looks good.  And he sounds great.  He sounds great, but he sounds very easily.  Well, the black artists have to stay over there.  Oh, boy.  Off the stage with a white artist.  Dick Clark said this, and this has happened many times, actually, that if we don't all  go on together, we go out.  We will pull the show out.  And he meant it.  He put people back in the bus.  It was amazing.  So he was also a music lover.  He had a heart of rock and roll.  Every act.  And he made his book that said, hey, Dick Clark helped my career. 
[00:52:00]  It looks like the New York Telephone Directory.  I mean, this guy is just amazing with that.  He's dating himself.  New York Telephone Directory.  What is that?  We use Yelp now.  Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about?  What about Yelp?  My fingers do the walking.  Are you, cousins?  What about you?  What do you think?  You think it's going to make it?  We discovered a lot of stories together.  How come when they show these old shows like Bandstand and whatnot, it's all black and  white and everything, but the girls are teens and they look like they're in their 40s. 
[00:52:30]  Isn't that weird?  Every picture of your mother, she looks like that.  I guess so.  Yeah.  Every picture of your mom.  They're wearing those dumb cat glasses and fucking their hair is made up like an old maid.  They're doing an awful dance.  Shut the, da, da, da, da, da.  Shut the, da, da, da, da, da.  Don't let the blacks on the dance floor with us.  Shut the, da, da, da, da, da.  They're dancing to Star Wars music on bandstand?  Yeah.  That's cutting edge.  They have their knee-high socks.  They're innovative.  Yeah.  Oh, look, they had ducky boy hairdos.  Yeah, they would have dresses that look like tablecloths. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, they just looked old.  They were wearing scarves, like a silk scarf.  Yeah, yeah.  A sweater.  Yeah.  Their pits are sweating in their sweater.  Yeah, they just looked old.  I don't know what it is.  Rotten, hairy vaginas and big fucking panties.  Yuck.  Bloomers.  They had the big bloomers that were tight around the leg holes and tight around the  waist, but then real puffy and stuff in the middle.  All the better to hold your maxi pad and belt that held on the fucking apparatus with clips 
[00:53:30]  and fucking springs.  How you bitches used to wear them fucking maxi pads is beyond me.  And Cousin Bruce, he sounds really good.  Like, he just talked.  He's a very good talker.  Yeah, it's very natural.  Yeah, he can still just go and make a few good points in a row without being fucking  prompted.  That's what it's condescending to say about an old person.  I know.  It really is.  Always functions very well for an old person.  You guys follow the Iron Sheik? 
[00:54:00]  No.  No.  The underscore Iron Sheik.  You want to read some of his?  Is he real, though?  Come on.  That's not the real one.  I think it's that dopey Jewish guy.  Oh, right.  That exploits him?  Yeah, that exploits him.  I think he writes this.  Exploits the pissing wrestler.  There's no BS with ESS.  Yeah, read some of his Dick Clark tweets, because he was very reflective.  Very reflective.  I humbled him.  The Dick Clark have the dick sex with the Mexican Jose Canseco, because he don't like  the black people.  Fuck him, motherfucker. 
[00:54:30]  Hashtag Team Sheiky.  Team Sheiky!  When did he tweet that?  13 hours ago.  Holy shit.  The Dick Clark don't respect the black people.  I hope he get fucked by blackest brother in the prison.  Team Sheiky.  Yeah, that's not the Iron Sheik's people.  That's just a fucking goof account.  It has to be.  Fucking hilarious.  He has 115,000 fucking followers around this guy.  It probably is somebody in his camp.  How could they be that stupid?  Like, for no reason just to...  Because the Iron Sheik's not doing anything else. 
[00:55:00]  He can't even fucking walk.  They know negative attention is still.  It's still a heel, right?  Right.  What else?  I put him in camel clutch and humbled him.  Oh, he's got a Virgil reference.  The no Dick Clark is worse than the Virgil and...  Oh, no Dick.  The no Dick Clark is worse than the Virgil and deserve to get his ass humble old country  and new country way.  Hashtag Team Sheiky.  Wow.  Well, they know enough to...  It's funny.  They know enough to do Team Sheiky.  Yeah, yeah.  Read the one about choking on his balls. 
[00:55:30]  Dick Clark deserved to choke on his balls from because he don't respect the new generation,  music, or the legend.  Hashtag Team Sheiky.  Hashtag Team Sheiky.  He's a good one to follow on Twitter.  That does look like a good one.  Or one of his people.  They're out of their minds.  My cock.  Yeah, I think it is because it's all like, you know, and then all the pictures are him  meeting fans and stuff.  Yeah, no, I think it's him.  Oh, boy.  I mean, it's his camp.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's his camp.  He can't write stuff like that. 
[00:56:00]  We should break because we've got a new Mel Gibson tape.  Oh, yeah.  We've got a kid shitting her pants, and it's the top story on the news.  What?  We, I think we can't do that.  What's that top story?  Because it's, I don't know.  We're going to find out.  Bieber impersonator busted?  The guy didn't even look like Bieber.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, that wasn't really him.  Want my money back.  Ian, we also got a pilot bragging about, you know, having sex and stuff from yesterday. 
[00:56:30]  It's great.  He didn't know his mic was on.  It's classic.  And I think we're doing Homeless Pyramid to break.  You know how to take Clark?  Oh, right.  Oh, we did that.  And Tippi Tom.  Just an excuse to play this again.  Oh, that was fantastic.  It's tough to bring it back without Tippi Tom, though.  I know, without Tom.  Tom was the best.  He's the man.  We could bring back some of these bits, though, I'm starting to think, right?  We could do Idiot Pyramid.  And bring in, like, the Idiots, Bobo, Bobo, Oscar.  Oscar's always good for one.  Bobo will fuck it up so badly. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  What am I supposed to say to describe an airplane?  Remember when his clue was things Anthony would say?  Oh, my God.  And he just kept saying...  Really racist stuff?  What was he saying?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was horrific.  He put his dumb little finger out and just said the N-word.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember that?  Yeah, he put his finger out and he goes,  Digger.  Who did?  Bobo.  The categorist described things Anthony would say.  And he just put his finger out. 
[00:57:30]  He's hilarious.  What a dummy.  He is an ass.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, let's play this.  All right.  Yeah.  Papa Rock is going to try to have Francine say what's on the paper.  All right.  We're writing down the clue.  All right.  We're writing down the clue.  And you're going to have 30 seconds.  I got the bed in front of me here.  Oh, good.  We'll have 30 seconds.  All right.  So you got 30 seconds, Papa Rock, to make Francine say what's on the paper, okay?  He's thinking.  All right.  What is it?  Whisper it to everybody, Jimmy, out there in radio. 
[00:58:00]  Things on a plane.  You didn't hear that, did you, Francine?  Things on a plane.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's Papa Rock.  Go.  Stewardess.  What?  Aeroplane.  Things on a plane.  Oh, wait a minute.  But it wasn't you.  He's giving the clues.  He's talking right to Papa Rock. 
[00:58:30]  He's giving the clues.  I'll give you the clues.  Francine gets close by saying a plane, not things on a plane.  She goes, a plane.  And then Papa Rock goes, things on a plane, like he won.  But he's the guy giving the clues.  He's not even part of that team.  Good one.  I'm going to bring the plane.  Ah.  Oh, Jesus.  Fine films are meant to be enjoyed in a relaxing and intimate setting, something usually reserved  for the prominent and wealthy.  I went by.  It was really fun. 
[00:59:00]  Anthony Cumia cordially invites you to join him in his private theater to watch films the  way they're meant to be experienced.  It was just so awkward.  He was just standing there with a beer in the middle of this fucking castle by himself.  Not a friend to be had.  Our welcoming host will ease your every word.  While he stands there with a weapon.  Enjoy state-of-the-art equipment.  You got to kind of watch on the screen and half on the ceiling.  Crystal clear picture.  I've never seen a giant movie screen show half a fucking film before.  Engrossing sound.  The lips were moving and then sound would come out 40 seconds later.  World-class concessions. 
[00:59:30]  Including the finest food and beverages.  A big plastic jug of wheat pretzels.  Fucking warm water.  And an authentic popcorn machine.  He's showing me things that will be fun someday.  Like, hey, look at this.  This will make popcorn someday, but not when you're here.  You'll leave wondering how you could possibly enjoy a movie anywhere else.  I would rather watch it through a Viewmaster.  Fucking shitty night that was.  Cumia Theaters.  Luxury, isolation, and heavy artillery.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s. 
[01:00:00]  Fuck you.  But I want to kill myself.  Fuck you, Anthony.  Fuck you.  This is a big fuck you to everybody in my life.  All I want to fucking do is sit down at my own shit naked playing fucking video games.  At work and school.  My fucking girlfriend, y'all have to fucking fuck it up.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Hi, this is a big F.U. to me for my limited news exposure.  Because any time I say a quote or say that I heard something and it's topical and it's informative 
[01:00:30]  and they say, oh, where'd you get that from?  I say the O.N.A. show and I look like a complete buffoon.  So, fuck you guys.  Fuck you.  Hey, Chip.  Just wanted to call in and say thank you.  Watching the message, I've had to say, what's that?  5,000 fucking times.  F.U.  Fuck you.  Um, yeah, this F.U. goes after Valley Jim.  Valley Jim, you fucking suck.  Fuck your fucking grody comments. 
[01:01:00]  Give me the douche shows.  Fuck you, Valley Jim.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this message is for little Jimmy Norton.  Thanks for creating the Uncle Paul character.  Now every time my shit nephews call me Uncle Paul, I feel like a fucking creep.  So, fuck you, Jim Norton.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  It's the O.P. and Anthony F.U. and Anthony F.U. and Anthony F.U. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, I know what this is about.  Let me get the thing.  Oh, nice.  I know this one.  I know this one.  It's for Dick Clark, right?  No?  Well, down in the hole.  No, man in the box. 
[01:02:00]  Poor man in the box.  You're right.  I am.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Sexy.  That's so much louder than the rest of the show.  Yeah, I don't know why.  Like, it fucking hurts my ears, man.  Why are you yelling?  We said that years ago.  Oh, because there are excuses.  Sounds fun on the air.  Well, that's what they say when it's like, dude, it's so loud in my headphones when we 
[01:02:30]  play something from the other studio or the fucking CD or something.  Yeah.  And it's like, oh, it's okay.  It sounds great on the air.  It's like, no, that isn't my point.  My point is I'm getting my fucking ears blown off.  If you see the fucking act I have to do when we go to commercial, it's like, okay, and  we'll be right back.  I throw my headphones off because when the commercials start playing, it's blasting in  my fucking ears.  And they'll just say it sounds fine on the radio, and I would say to them, well, I do 
[01:03:00]  want to be able to talk to my own family.  Yeah, at some point.  Because my ears are going quickly at this point.  And what am I, on the fucking pay no mind list?  I am.  Look, the pay no mind list, number one, Anthony.  Oh, boy.  Anyone else we want on that fucking list?  And the fucked up thing is I don't want them to really try to fix it because, A, they  won't be able to fix it.  B, they'll fuck up something trying to fix it.  Then we'll be too low in the mix or something.  But the good news is another thing we could talk about for the next year or two. 
[01:03:30]  That's true.  In meetings.  That is true.  We'll discuss it.  I can't believe I'm number one on the pay no mind list.  That's good.  I'm looking at it right here.  I'm the only one on it.  That's the whole list.  Begins and ends with you, shithead.  You're right.  What else are we just discussing in meetings at this point?  Mr. Gamchi.  Well, certainly a visual element has been brought up.  We're discussing that, which is good.  Start a list.  We're discussing the podcast, which is good. 
[01:04:00]  Yep.  What else?  Let's see.  Okay.  You got podcasts.  Mm-hmm.  Visual element.  Mm-hmm.  Jim Norton's Rays.  Headphones.  Yay!  Money.  You forgot Jim Norton's Rays.  Jim Norton's Rays.  We've been discussing that for a couple years at this point.  The lighting you're good with now.  You're getting nothing in the light.  Yeah, that only took how many years?  I know it was more than a year.  I mean, no.  It was probably more than two. 
[01:04:30]  We discussed it for at least two years, and it finally happened.  So that's good.  That's progress.  Studio build-out.  Studio build-out.  We're up to three years as far as that goes.  Which is just funny, because it's so cyclical, because you spent the first three years of XM  bitching about a studio build-out.  You finally get the studio build-out, and then you have to come here and bitch about a studio build-out.  And you question why I'm going crazy?  How long do we have that nice studio after we bitched about a studio build-out for three years? 
[01:05:00]  Well, you really didn't have it that much, especially because-  Less than a year, right?  Yeah, because you were at K-Rock, so you're only doing half the show in it.  Oh, that fucking shithouse.  And then you're-  Fuck that.  You're talking about K-Rock?  Fuck that shithouse.  Here we go again.  Fuck that shithouse.  We all have our issues, and they're all coming out today.  Oh, Jimmy did not like being there.  I fucking hated it from day one.  Yeah.  It was positive.  You didn't like when Tom Chisano came in every day with his ties and his shirts looking all nice? 
[01:05:30]  I didn't hate Tom at all.  He liked us.  You're out, Tom.  He didn't like me.  He was courteous.  Well, that's true.  But he didn't like-  No, no, it really is true.  I really don't know.  It's okay.  I know he didn't.  But he never told me that.  He didn't have to.  As a person, I'm sure he liked me, but on the air, he didn't.  And they were blaming me because we weren't doing what we were supposed to be.  We even talked about it.  But then they apologized.  I said, oh, sorry.  You know when that shit stopped?  You have to XM fucking boot us for a month.  Right. 
[01:06:00]  And that shit stopped.  I added getting YouTube hits to the meeting list.  Yay!  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  We got some things to discuss for the next two years.  This is awesome.  But if they fixed everything, they couldn't get you back there for a meeting.  Oh, the mic flag thing.  We've been discussing that for about, I would guess, about six months already.  So it's at smaller mic flags?  Yeah.  We discussed that at least six months ago.  Get my teeth moistening.  Apparatus.  Apparatus.  Didn't believe they made that. 
[01:06:30]  Smaller mic flags.  Is that an issue?  Try.  Oh, that's a big issue.  Yeah.  Because you can't take pictures of these celebrities.  It pretty much blocks you when you try to.  Oh, God.  It's like, hey, hey.  It's a massive thing on our mics.  Do you know I like the mics that come up?  Celebrity interviews.  Yeah, I think that's what you want.  I like the mics that come up better, dude.  I think you want newer mics.  Yeah, of course.  We want this whole thing to go away.  The flag.  You take the flag off right now.  You still got that.  What's the new one? 
[01:07:00]  Are they clear?  What?  How do they do it?  A stand.  A stand.  Yeah, the mic would be like this.  I love those.  They have them in...  It would look like this.  This is all you'd see.  The station I do in Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  It's a terrestrial station.  Randy and I think...  I'm not sure if it's partners.  Randy and Shithead, I think.  No, no.  I think it's just...  No, I don't even know them, so...  Because now that'll start a problem.  I was just going with a dumb fucking morning show.  But they have...  They're old mics, but they're just on the fucking table mics. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  For some reason, it's such a cool vibe.  Because you don't have that block in front of your face,  and you feel like you're just talking.  Yes.  You just want mics on a stand?  We can get you a mic on a stand.  I like that.  It would have to be fastened.  It can't just be a mic that's just sitting there.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  By the way, we're getting topical with the sex man.  Topical with the piggy boy.  Why was you saying it?  Oh, boy.  That's going to be the thing now. 
[01:08:00]  And he played Alice in Chains because they found Lane Staley's rotting body ten years ago.  Oh.  Oh, I thought it was a Dick Clark thing.  Wow.  I thought it was true.  It's both.  Oh, okay.  They discovered him dead ten years ago today.  It was both when Jim mentioned it.  Exactly.  No, once everybody thought it was a funny joke, he took credit for it, and that's not true.  You don't think he meant that?  No.  That piece of shit.  Fucking kill him.  What?  And the thing with Lane Staley, he was dead for, they guessed, at least, what, two weeks? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Supposedly died on the anniversary of Kurt Cobain's death, which was...  Which was like ten days ago.  April 9th-ish?  Oh.  Somewhere around there, right?  I thought it was like the 5th.  5th, April 5th, so two weeks.  Okay.  Two.  So he might have been dead for about two weeks before they found him.  Damn.  Because he closed out everyone from his life.  There's a lot of fucking damage there.  That long.  No one was allowed to see him.  No.  He just shut everyone out.  Is there pictures of, you know, him?  I've never seen any.  Or like his apartment or anything?  There's gotta be some. 
[01:09:00]  Wherever he was living?  There have to be some, sure.  Fucking love the Lane Staley.  What a voice.  All right.  What do you want to do?  You want to do the kid shitting her pants?  Yes.  I want to hear what this is all about.  That's a good story.  That's a great story.  And it should be number one on the news.  Yeah?  Yes.  It should be your lead story.  This is your lead story?  Number one to the Ozark.  Number two.  This is KY3 News at six.  Tonight, a mother is upset over a classroom incident that left her kindergartner embarrassed. 
[01:09:30]  Good evening.  I'm Jerry Jacob.  I'm Lisa Rose.  And we'll be talking to Steve Grant in Washington a little later in the newscast.  It was a six-year-old girl who had an accident in her classroom.  Now her parents are pushing for policy changes.  KY3's Sarah Forhats has the story from Southwest R5 School in Washburn.  They told me that the teacher had asked her to go to the restroom before testing time.  Lisa Skidmore says asking a young child.  Why does the names always work out in news stories?  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:00]  That's a great name.  That's a fucking thing.  This happens all the time.  Skidmore.  Skidmore?  Yeah.  Isn't that so fucking strange?  Oh.  I told her to go to the bathroom, but she couldn't.  So I said, let me take you down there.  Oh, jeez.  She had doo-doo in her underpants.  Doo-doo.  Yeah.  I told the news people.  I got it on my fingers by accident.  I was helping.  You're such a good help.  Yeah.  I was cleaning the whole area there, and it got under my nails. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  That's great.  So weird.  Skidmore.  Before testing time.  Lisa Skidmore says asking a young child to go to the bathroom on demand.  Is next to impossible.  You can't do that to a six-year-old.  That's why when her kindergartner told her teacher she had to go to the restroom during  the test and wasn't allowed, Lisa couldn't believe it.  Her little girl couldn't hold it.  She still had poop. 
[01:11:00]  Diarrhea poop.  Coming out.  Diarrhea poop.  What?  Why is this a story?  Come on.  Why?  Why is this the top story?  I don't know.  Diarrhea poop.  There should be a policy change.  You should fucking teach your kid how to not shit her pants.  Right.  That's a good policy.  I yelled at her in front of everybody.  I'm like, you're bad.  You're bad.  You think that's going to stick with her?  No, I don't know. 
[01:11:30]  Through her whole life.  I hope not.  I don't...  Sometimes they remember stuff.  You'd be surprised.  Oh, boy.  I thought you was asleep with the magic milk.  The magic milk.  Sure.  Poop.  Diarrhea poop.  Coming out the back, up the front, down her legs.  Skidmore says her daughter was forced to sit in the class for the remainder of test time,  about 15 minutes.  Then, mom was called after the test, and it was another 20-minute drive to school to pick 
[01:12:00]  her daughter up.  All the while, her little girl had to sit in the mess.  No one bothered to clean her up, though a teacher did give her a trash bag to wrap around  herself.  Don't even treat a dog that way.  Did you say like...  Diarrhea poop.  That is kind of a teacher being a cunt, I think, right?  That's a teacher kind of a cunt.  Oh, without a doubt.  I would go to the school and punch the teacher in the face.  No problem.  Yeah, you'd have to do that.  Travis, would you punch the teacher in the face if this happened to your daughter? 
[01:12:30]  Absolutely.  You wouldn't deal with...  You wouldn't put up with this shit.  It sucks that your kid is shitting all over the place.  At the end of the story, they'll tell you why she wouldn't let her...  Oh!  Because there was more pictures to take!  No, uncle.  You can't let them go.  They run away and hide.  Take all the pictures and you get your break.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Huh?  It's terrible.  Why?  It's photo day at the school.  Everybody smile.  Take a picture to remember the day you shit your pants.  Yeah.  Me and Mr. McGregor. 
[01:13:00]  Mr. McGregor.  His wife would make cookies while we took paint pictures.  Yeah.  She probably ran out of underpants, I'm going to guess.  What?  It must suck to go to school to be a teacher and then you become a kindergarten teacher  and your main job is to make sure you have enough underpants.  Little underpants.  For the little girls that are peeing and shitting.  Oh, that used to be the thing when I was growing up.  Really?  I never needed them, but I'm just saying.  It used to be the thing.  Oh, you never needed them.  Everybody had like a change of clothes that they were supposed to bring in. 
[01:13:30]  But supposedly the teacher had a whole fucking, you know.  I wouldn't take a teacher's underpants.  They brought them in.  They give a little thong to the kid.  Just diarrhea.  It's being split right down the middle.  You put a camera in it.  You ever pee in class?  No.  No.  I was never the shit, puke, or piss in class kid.  Because that shit would follow you.  That follows you throughout your school history. 
[01:14:00]  You know what?  Like the clap.  As soon as you said that, I thought to myself, Rosie.  Yeah?  Roseanne, actually.  Will not use the last name.  But she peed her fucking pants, puddle on the floor, first, second grade, whatever the  fuck it was, right around there.  That sound of running water, was that it?  And then everyone goes, what?  What is that?  I said, oh, no.  And then everyone starts chatting to each other.  Piss.  She's pissing herself.  Pissing herself.  And on top of that, she was one of those ridiculously shy people that would rather just continue 
[01:14:30]  peeing instead of like bringing it to anyone's attention.  Yeah.  Big puddle.  Stopped the class.  Walked her out in shame.  Oh, the walk of shame, yes.  And the teacher had an extra pair of underpants for her.  And she came back in.  And guess what?  Yeah, we didn't remember that 10 years later when we were all in high school.  Now she's hot with titties and shit.  She was always known as the girl that peed her pants. 
[01:15:00]  Right to the end, man.  Right as she was getting her diploma.  That's what we were thinking.  Young Skidmore has video news footage about her problem.  Yes, about this.  Yeah.  I'm sure her friends won't find that.  The young Skidmore girl.  Why would the mom agree to be on the news?  How famous do you need to be?  You want to make sure it's on your Facebook page, do you?  How about you go to the news?  You know what?  This is embarrassing to my kid and our entire family.  They say, no, we're not going to talk to you. 
[01:15:30]  I don't even treat a dog that way.  I don't know.  She says she's hoping policy will change and common sense will prevail.  I don't want this to happen to any other kid.  That's the point of it, too, you know.  I don't want this ever happening.  The little girl's dad has a tough time even talking about it.  If any parent, any parent sent their kids to school with crappy pants, 
[01:16:00]  those parents would be facing criminal charges.  I believe that with all my heart.  The family isn't pressing charges,  but likely pressed hard enough for the school to consider changing its ways.  If it's your child, I mean, it hits a raw nerve.  I mean, deep.  In Washburn, Sarah Foreheads, KY3 News.  No, I don't fault the parents.  Horrible parent for being on the news.  Horrible.  I wouldn't do that.  They don't know.  The news is despicable for pushing this. 
[01:16:30]  The parents think they might get something done.  They don't understand that the news is just putting a shit-your-pants story first.  Yeah, they don't give a fuck what you have to say.  They know it's a great news watch.  Yeah, but wouldn't you as the parent first think,  like, hey, I'm not going to bring this to the news  because this is just going to give more unwanted attention.  Maybe, but they don't think of the implications of that  because they're not experienced with it.  They're not involved with the media.  They don't realize that this is going to fucking haunt this dumb kid for fucking time.  They probably didn't think it was going to be the top story on the news.  Probably not.  Jay from Huntington on Twitter writes,  We had Mexican Seizure Kid. 
[01:17:00]  Explain that shit to a room of second graders.  Mexican Seizure Kid?  But that's what you remember.  And then you go through school with Mexican Seizure Kid.  And that's how he'll be known for the rest of your time with him in school.  In Washburn, Sarah Foreheads, KY3 News.  Foreheads?  Sarah Foreheads?  Skid fucking more?  I bet you she's got a massive forehead, too.  That would rule.  I need to see Sarah Foreheads. 
[01:17:30]  Where's Sarah Foreheads?  Yeah.  Or she has foreheads?  I guarantee she has bangs.  She's from the Bible.  She has bangs to try to cover her forehead.  Because, you know, as soon as you say Sarah Foreheads,  everyone's going to look at her forehead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's Sarah Foreheads?  Let's look at Sarah Forehead.  Oh, my God.  We can play the rest of the clip, then.  Many kids taking MAP tests right now.  That's the state's standardized test required by law.  Those tests start in the third grade.  The superintendent says the reason the teacher was sticking so closely to MAP testing guidelines, 
[01:18:00]  even for a kindergartner, is because she was trying to simulate the stringent rule she'd  face later.  Oh.  Was that a real picture of the kid covered in shit?  No.  That's just the kid.  God.  I'm like, what the fuck is that?  There's the mom.  All right.  Where's the Sarah?  That's Skidmore.  Yeah.  That's Skidmore.  Where's the Sarah Forehead?  And then Sarah Forehead kind of has a forehead, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She kind of has a forehead issue.  She's trying to cover it up with a little swooping hair thing, but.  Oh, God.  Is she pretty? 
[01:18:30]  No, she's very plain Jane-ish.  You'd pop her in the shitter.  I like how they say their little graphic is Washburn, Missouri, the place to be.  The place to be.  Really?  It's spelled F-O-R-H-E-T-Z, foreheads, but it's foreheads.  It's probably farts.  Sarah Farts.  Yeah.  I bet she grew up with a bunch of Sarah foreheads.  I'm a teacher.  When you're testing, it's very strict guidelines, and if you break the rules, you can get fired. 
[01:19:00]  Even if a kid's shitting.  Oh, man.  What the fuck?  How about you think like a human being?  I don't think anyone's going to fire a teacher because they see a kid having diarrhea poop pouring out of their fucking pants.  Diarrhea poop.  I don't want my kid to go to school.  How do I fucking make that happen?  Homeschool.  Yeah.  That doesn't work either.  Oh, homeschooling stinks.  Then you're just a weird kid. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, then they're socially inept.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  You make these socially awkward weirdos like that.  Yeah.  School sounds like it sucks now.  Well, you know, they got to go through it.  You can't just homeschool your kids, can't you?  No.  You can if you want.  Sure.  Back in the 80s.  Brewer does.  I'll have a discussion with Brewer because fuck yeah, he does.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he does.  I got to ask him how he gets social.  Did you carry the five? 
[01:20:00]  He doesn't picture him doing that shit.  No, you stupid.  Yeah.  Carry the two.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Look at that little number.  Ha, ha, ha.  I ain't going to do the teaching.  I'll fucking hire some teachers to come by.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Is that what you do?  You hire teachers?  Yeah.  Dude, you have no idea what goes on.  My sister has to do homework.  She's...  How old's my sister?  She's pushing 40 at this point.  She has to do homework like she's back in school.  Why don't she pull it for a while? 
[01:20:30]  40.  Do you understand what happens to these teachers?  Fuck, I said it.  The teachers give these kids a lot of busy work.  Yeah.  And then you have to do the homework for your kid.  That's what's going on out there.  Mm-mm.  All right, we're going to break so we get Rich Voss in here proper.  Voss is in today.  I want to talk about his one-legged brother.  Yeah, I want to find out what that story is all about  and why he's so fucking nasty about following.  What is he doing out there?  Who? 
[01:21:00]  He's looking at some bitch.  He's looking at words.  But one of the computers, he doesn't even know what it is.  Words, words, words.  What is this machine?  This infernal device.  This internal device.  And Rain Friar at 930.  I've never met her.  What's your prior's daughter?  And double or nothing on the bet from yesterday?  What?  I bet you Rich Voss says, here's the thing.  You want to take this bet?  Oh, please.  You want to take this bet?  That's a given.  What?  What are you talking about?  That's a given.  Why is that?  Take the bet.  No.  I want my, I'll take my 20. 
[01:21:30]  Fuck.  I listened on, um, what is that called?  Right after Obie and Anthony, it's called the, uh.  Oh, the shit show.  No, we can't call it the shit show.  Why?  Because that reflects badly on us.  No, it doesn't.  He broke it down yesterday.  He said, damn.  He doesn't call it the shit show because that implies that you guys chose to put on a show  show of shit caliber after yours, which makes you guys not the best judges of content.  That's fair and accurate.  Yeah.  So, and what's the problem?  Also, the solution is to get rid of Sam. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Fuck.  I'd never thought of it that way.  Sam is garbage.  No, I think they were.  So long, garbage.  I think they were okay with just being shit, putting shit on after.  Ah.  But again, that's not, it's just after Obie and Anthony live.  Look, regardless, I was listening to that.  Again?  Yes.  Again.  Well.  You do listen a lot for someone that doesn't like it.  I'm in my car.  There's hundreds of channels on this.  Not really.  No.  No.  Dude, the Grateful Dead channel is rocking. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, God.  Fucking rocking.  Nothing better than listening to fucking, that drum fucking solo song while I'm on the  expressway.  Well, they got the Further Festival at the Beacon Theater.  The Further Festival.  The mashup's running.  She looks great.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  How does she look so good still?  She does look good, man.  She doesn't like her late 40s.  No, she's not here.  Good genes or good docs?  What?  Your show is terrible.  Shut the fuck up, Edgar.  You don't help anything. 
[01:23:00]  You call on.  I forgot what I was going to say when I was listening to the shit show.  Oh, what was it?  What were we talking about?  I don't know.  It had to do with something.  I would imagine.  Teeth.  I don't know.  No, it wasn't teeth.  It was very funny to hear your doorman yesterday, Opie.  Oh, yeah.  I heard that.  You shut up.  The doorman fucking implicating himself in a fucking crime.  That was all for the radio. 
[01:23:30]  It was great.  He was fucking totally implicating himself.  Was it the Kenny song yesterday?  No.  Have you heard it?  Although it was pretty goddamn good.  Shut up.  I like that.  I'm Edgar's clue.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, no.  Wow.  I hope he does a pretty goddamn good Edgar.  He does not.  He does not?  Shut up, Edgar.  Opie doesn't sound like me.  I'm gonna fuck you up.  I don't like salty language. 
[01:24:00]  Salty language.  And because I'm your clue, my teeth are dry.  That's pretty goddamn good, man.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  You'd be hard-pressed as a listener to figure out which one's which.  I had pills stuck to my teeth.  Pills?  Because I was trying to swallow my vitamins.  Vitamins?  And they stick to your teeth?  Yes.  Why?  Because they're dry. 
[01:24:30]  I swallow cotton balls in the morning.  I bet the rabbit's ain't dead.  Oh, wow.  That got a double clap and a gun pointy thing.  Like everything does from Chip.  All right, listen.  We're going to talk about Jews next.  Stay there.  Poop.  Diarrhea poop.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Where are you? 
[01:25:00]  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me.  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me.  I remember when I met you.  You'll notice me.  Me, me, me, me.  Hurting me.  Pain me.  Say.  Say about me. 
[01:25:30]  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me.  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me.  Me, me, me.  Me, me, me. 
[01:26:00]  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me.  Where are you?  Why aren't you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Me, me, me, me.  I think they know it.  Eric, why? 
[01:26:30]  Seriously.  Iraq is so radio.  Why?  You didn't hear Jimmy talking?  No, because I play filler after the break.  You don't give me a cue, so you turn the mics on.  How do I know you're talking?  I keep the studio.  How about you listen to the show?  Jimmy was actually talking.  He started the break.  Well, I'm sorry.  I didn't know you were going out of the format that we usually do, so I apologize.  He loves a good format.  Wait, what am I missing?  Iraq loves a good format.  What am I missing?  What am I missing?  You didn't hear Jimmy talking, so wouldn't that make you go, you know what, I don't need  a sweeper there. 
[01:27:00]  You've got to be able to go with the flow.  What am I missing?  Seriously, tell me right now.  Missing that after the commercials.  No, what am I missing?  Did you hear Jimmy talking?  No, I didn't hear you.  Why not?  Because I didn't have you on in here.  Why don't you have us on in there?  Because I don't put you on until after the sweeper.  Why?  Oh, boy.  That's dumb.  I never have your room live until we come back.  I'm not good.  Wait, so when Jimmy was talking about the song, no one heard that?  No.  You guys weren't on. 
[01:27:30]  I don't know.  I'm not good.  So, Jimmy was talking about where that song came from, from Drew Boogie.  No.  Turning the mics on in the middle of something being played when it's not usually the show,  how am I supposed to know?  Yeah, I totally were on.  What do you mean, how are you supposed to know?  Shouldn't you just know?  No, because after commercial and live read, I go into some filler material.  I really don't understand.  But you don't hear the show itself at that point?  I hear what's being played in this room.  Why? 
[01:28:00]  Why don't you hear the show?  What if we decide to go off base there a little bit?  We absolutely want to sometimes.  Then just wave to me and I'll turn the room on.  But we don't know.  Sometimes it just happens.  Yeah, can't you just monitor what we're doing in here?  I will from now on.  No, instead he turned the mics on at the wrong time, we'd kill him.  Like, if he thought we wanted something on the air because our mouths were near the mics,  but we were just bashing management by name, and it went out over the air, we'd fucking strangle him.  All right, it just sounds a little weird.  Yeah, he's in a no-win in there, as he shouldn't be. 
[01:28:30]  Because Jimmy was discussing where that song came from.  Yeah, I was just saying, I was bashing someone needy, and Drew was a genius.  And made it into a song.  For making that.  Opium Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Tell us again, Jimmy.  Well, I was, um, you know.  The Opium Anthony Show, Sirius XM, Solid Radio.  That's very important.  We play a sweeper right now.  Two lasers.  I'm not good.  I'm not good.  I'm not good.  I'm not good.  I'm not good.  It's not Iraq's fault, I guess, but. 
[01:29:00]  All right, whatever.  We'll figure that out.  You know, you have the hook to the song.  All you need is a few, like, fucking words.  And that's a real song right there.  I'll tell you what's a real song, too.  It's fucking, uh, Why Don't They Behave.  Yeah, Bollinger Behave.  I love that one.  Goddamn Drew, you know, just takes a rant and makes a cool fucking song out of it.  Take something that, a complete piece of shit.  It's talent.  No disrespect.  But he can take anything and make it into a fucking, a hit.  He's great. 
[01:29:30]  Really?  Hi, Rich.  Yeah, Bollinger Behave.  That's a great one.  Richard Voss.  Oh, Rich Voss.  Hi, Rich Voss.  What I was talking to you about earlier, about quit trying.  Just stop trying.  He stopped.  E-Rock stopped.  E-Rock has adopted that logic of just, just give up.  Just stop trying.  Well, but you've got to explain why you said that, Rich.  Rich came in here.  He hasn't been in here in a while.  And he sees all these, like, what could be described as kind of like TV lights.  Yeah, filters.  Because even though they're not giving us a visual element, we figure, what the fuck?  Let's set it up like we have one.  Let's make pretend or something. 
[01:30:00]  But it's for what we do take pictures and little videos, so, you know, they look better.  But you go, why are you guys still trying?  And, you know, the logic in that, I can't argue.  Yeah, it really is.  Let's find our voice.  Let's, you know, it's like, you know what I mean?  It's like, it's like now jumping on MySpace.  It's just a little too fucking late.  Is that it?  Yeah.  You are what you are.  You're great.  Of course we are.  No one is as good as you guys around the country.  You are.  But that's it. 
[01:30:30]  You're not going to get any...  Oh, oh, oh, look at their videos are so much clearer.  Nobody gives a fuck.  Rich.  I don't know.  It's all changing.  You might be wrong, Rich.  Yeah, the whole world is changing.  Yeah.  And we kind of want to be bigger than we are.  We kind of want, you know, real people to push the show and understand what this could  be.  And I told Jimmy in the bathroom, we need a miracle between now and October.  A literal miracle.  Yeah.  But, you know, in radio, sometimes that just happens. 
[01:31:00]  We were fucked dead in the water.  And then all of a sudden I get a call from Eric Loden going, hey, hey, just want to let  you know I'm joining the company.  I fucking, I would have, I would have blew someone at that point.  Me too.  I would have blew someone.  I'm like, holy fuck, we've been saved.  And that's what we're hoping between now and October that we get another miracle.  That's what I'm hoping for.  Yeah.  Because these guys are just not getting it done.  Well, here's, I'll tell you some ideas.  Yeah.  Good.  Some live events that generate heat.  We're doing one, by the way, in Cleveland.  Cleveland, Ohio. 
[01:31:30]  But that has issues.  Cleveland, everybody.  Next, let's move.  Friday.  It would be next Friday.  We're doing a show and it'll be an afternoon show.  The Hard Rock in Cleveland next afternoon from three to seven.  Did you hear about the tall tops we got to sit at so the audience can see us?  What do you mean?  You know those tables and chairs in a bar that are a lot higher up?  They're like cocktail tables in a bar.  I can't get up on them.  We have to sit.  Is there a stage?  Your little feet down.  No, there's no stage.  There's no stage.  Everything's flat, so if they... 
[01:32:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  What are you doing this on my wife's ass?  Oh, oh, oh.  But how, what do you mean?  In the Hard Rock, how is it on a stage?  I don't know.  Maybe they bring in a stage.  I don't know.  I'm being told this is amongst the smallest Hard Rocks in the country.  No, I've performed there.  What?  I've performed at the Cleveland Hard Rock.  You have?  Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.  House of Blues.  House of Blues.  House of Blues.  That would have been the ideal place.  But they were booked.  But they were booked.  In all fairness, they were booked.  So we went to the Hard Rock, and to be seen, we've got to be...  We have to sit in stools. 
[01:32:30]  On big, giant stools.  There's no stage?  Like Regis.  There's a Hard Rock with no stage?  There's no showroom.  It's a restaurant.  We're...  Oh, I see, I see.  We're going to be in a restaurant.  Yeah, we're going to be in a restaurant.  All right, well, it said Hard Rock.  Cleveland Hard Rock.  That's the place.  Wait, what is that?  Let me see.  Which hallway are we going to be performing in?  If you need tips on restaurant gigs.  That's the bar.  Maybe we could stand on the bar.  Oh, no.  That's the room.  Oh, you guys will be in front of the fireplace.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, next to the shirts.  All right. 
[01:33:00]  I guess the...  You know, once ten people are in, we've got to start turning people away.  It's exhausting.  Did somebody approve this, though, and look at it?  I never saw this.  I guess that we had the option.  I just assumed that we were playing in a real room.  You know, it's the first time back in Cleveland in years, and Cleveland was always one of  our bestest markets.  Is that a little riser?  Oh, no.  It's just the way my pants are sitting. 
[01:33:30]  Jimmy.  If I...  Love your dick jokes.  If you guys fly me out and pay me, I'll do a...  Well, we can't even...  Yeah, you can't even get a fucking gig to do that.  What?  What?  It's going to be a great time.  Oh, of course it is, Kenny.  Of course it will be good.  I make fun wherever I go.  Positive brings positive.  Oh.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Maybe we can spread around the room so we, you know...  Oh, yeah.  You want to do that?  We'll have coverage.  Spread around the room.  We're going to throw it over five tables down to Opie. 
[01:34:00]  I'm going to be under the Jimi Hendrix guitar.  Oh.  Wait, is that a...  Why can't we do it right there?  Yeah.  Isn't that a little riser right there?  Yeah.  That looks like a little stage.  Yeah, that's what we're doing.  Oh, I thought there was no stage.  I thought it was flat and we were up on big stools.  No, there is a stage, but the stage is not as elevated as the one in New York.  Oh, but it's elevated a little bit.  How many seats are there?  I heard it wasn't elevated at all.  How many seats for the listeners?  How many seats are looking fit?  $2.50.  Oh, that's okay.  For the whole restaurant.  That's not too bad.  No, for the room that we're in.  Oh, nice.  It looks like a Denny's. 
[01:34:30]  All right, it'll be good then.  I can bet against...  It's all white people.  It must be a Denny's.  No, it's our crowd.  Good.  It's so weird when you do a live event with an O&A crowd because they don't really have  shovels.  They all look down, so it's hard to get their attention anyhow.  Now, if you're sitting that high and fucking...  Well, they're looking down so they can tweet how awful we are.  Yeah.  It's not low self-esteem. 
[01:35:00]  No.  I got a fucking ticket driving in here.  These motherfuckers.  This lady cop.  Boo!  She was no lady.  First of all, and I'm not a racist, but she was Afro-American.  Afro-American.  Why is it important to the story then?  Because she was not letting Whitey go on this one.  All right, give us the details.  I'm driving down 40th.  I came out of the Lincoln.  Sure.  In the right-hand lane.  Not ironic.  Okay.  And then I go on to 40th.  Yeah.  Usually, I go over and then go over to 42nd.  This conversation is moronic. 
[01:35:30]  Okay, well, hold on.  Did you make a left on 8th from 40th?  I made a left on 8th from 40th.  That's illegal.  At two minutes after 7.  Illegal.  Okay.  Jimmy's right.  So I pulled out two PBA cards, and she looked at me and said, what are those?  Oh, God.  And I put them right back in my wallet.  What are those?  What are those?  I said, can you just cut me a break?  And not even a fucking word.  They all had a bunch of tickets ready.  Was she a cop or a traffic person?  Ah, true.  I think she was.  Because I was going to keep driving.  I was going to take a chance.  Yeah.  Cops don't want to be dealing with that shit.  Did she have a gun?  It's the traffic cops.  Did she have a gun? 
[01:36:00]  They're all about being robots and giving out tickets.  Huh?  Was she fat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was not a cop.  Was she holding the ticket book, the gun, a pen, and her flashlight?  She, uh...  You got caught by a traffic cop.  They're the worst...  No, no.  There was a cop car there.  Park.  They're the worst...  Yeah.  They put one in that area so you don't fuck around and you think it's the actual police.  It's not the police.  Oh, because I was going to drive away.  They're the worst people in New York City, the traffic cops.  They're disgusting individuals.  That won't listen to shit because they're just money makers for the city.  They don't give a fuck.  And they hire certain people that could take a lot of shit. 
[01:36:30]  I said to her, because I get crazy and I go to the age.  She didn't know what the PBA cards were.  What are those?  That means it was a traffic cop.  Yeah.  Traffic cops don't get PBA cards.  What are those?  What are those?  And what's disgusting?  My fingers?  Goddamn, Jamie.  No, no.  Just let it be.  Yeah.  Just let it be.  Oh, my God.  And then I said to her, because I get a little edgy.  I go, I hope you hit your quota.  And nothing.  She just turned it back on me.  She's not a real cop, but they put them in the cop uniforms. 
[01:37:00]  And I've talked to a lot of the NYPD guys.  They're disgusted that they get to walk around in what looks like an NYPD uniform.  So I'm going to get points for this.  Yeah, you are.  She fucked you over, man.  In my fucking new BMW, man.  It's my first ticket.  What was the violation?  Making a left.  A left?  Illegal left.  Illegal left.  Yeah, that's a couple of prints.  I fought that once and got away with it.  I said that a bus was cutting me off. 
[01:37:30]  And in order to avoid an accident, I had to make that left turn.  I actually fought it.  And they were like, all right.  Did you have to pay for the ticket?  No.  It got dismissed.  So use that strategy.  But don't say a bus.  Say an ambulance.  A bambi.  I said it was a problem because I was in the bus lane, and then I made an illegal turn.  And I said there was construction, and I was going to go around the right side of the construction.  And it was only one lane around the right side.  And I said, but a bus also was going around that way, pushed me into the lane, and then I was forced to make the turn. 
[01:38:00]  And I said it was definitely a dangerous situation that I had to react to, and that's how I reacted.  And they said, you know what?  There's enough doubt there, and let me go.  Good for you.  Here's the thing.  It's a $130 ticket.  For me to come from Jersey to sit in court in New York, you know.  A lot of people do that.  But for the points, it's kind of important.  It's worth it.  Why, does your insurance go up if you get a point?  Yeah, your insurance goes up.  No, insurance likes that.  And then if you get more points, you could definitely lose your fucking license. 
[01:38:30]  Well, if you get 12 points.  You know, I don't live like you.  I'm not, you know, my points are for a turn.  I have no points on my license.  Yeah, because you fight it.  I fight it.  I pay the tickets.  What happened?  I'll send cash in lieu of points.  I've always said that.  Can you do that?  Sometimes if you talk to the, whatever they're called, they're like the prosecutor.  Yeah, you talk to them and say, you know, look, I'd be more than willing to pay whatever  I need to pay to avoid the points. 
[01:39:00]  And they sometimes kick it down to a traffic violation that doesn't have points.  Wow, you're good.  I think one of them is opening your door into traffic.  Really?  Yeah, that's a big one that they plea a lot of shit down to.  But you didn't do that.  That's why it's so weird.  I know.  Plea bargains are odd.  Very good, Rich.  Wow, that was Rich farting on the mic.  Wow, edgy.  How edgy.  Woo.  The words of Rich Foss.  Woo.  Wow.  Marconi Award all around. 
[01:39:30]  Marconi Awards for everybody.  Air Awards.  Here we go.  Air Awards.  Edward R. Murrow.  Right.  It's just, these people were robots.  She's a robot, like you say.  I had one of them actually jump on the hood of my fucking car.  I was going on vacation.  No, I'm not even joking.  I was there.  Where was that?  That's by Great Adventure.  Oh, I was trying to get into the Lincoln Tunnel.  I mean, the backup was so bad.  Yes, I was asshole driver guy, but I had to fucking, I had to go. 
[01:40:00]  I was late for something.  I forget now.  I was in the right lane and pulled that move all the way up the right side and tried to tuck in.  And one of those traffic cops caught me at the last fucking second.  And I'm still like pushing it like, nope.  And I keep rolling and rolling.  I'm like, no, you're going to have to just let me go.  And she's trying to get me over.  It was a guy actually trying to get me over to the side.  So she could write the ticket.  He, sorry, could write the ticket.  App actually jumped on the hood of my car to make me stop.  They're insane.  Wow.  They hire insane people with no personalities.  We were driving down. 
[01:40:30]  They can do some crazy shit to write the ticket.  We were driving down 9th Avenue leaving New York and you know how packed it is going down 9th again.  It's a fucking nightmare.  And we get to like where B and H, 30 something street.  I love those Jews.  Great.  So as we're going straight, then the lady says, make a right.  We're going, go fuck yourself.  We've been here for an hour.  I know they do that.  I go, no.  And I kept going.  I go, I'm not doing it.  I've done that too.  Where they tell you, you're sitting in fucking horrific traffic. 
[01:41:00]  You got to make a turn.  And then when you get to the turn that you have to make, they go, no, keep going straight.  Keep going straight.  And then you realize you're going to be, have to go around and around the block, which is going to take you another hour.  Easily.  And I do the same thing.  I go, I go, nope.  And I turn.  And sometimes it will stand in front of your vehicle.  They're crazy.  They're crazy people.  But what you have to do, I finally figured out, you nod like, oh, okay.  You take the right.  And as soon as she turns her back a little bit, she thinks you're, you know.  You make it look like you're doing what you are. 
[01:41:30]  Okay, oh, we're doing, oh, okay.  And as soon as she turns her fucking head.  I've done that many times.  When I was copping crack, I was on like 157th Street.  Oh, Jesus.  And I'm driving up the road, and the cops were, the cops said, pull over.  And I just said, fucking no.  And I took off, and he hit my taillight with his billy club.  That's my taillight.  And I kept fucking going.  That was an old Southern sheriff.  I kept fucking going.  Taillights out too, boy.  They're going to pay you the way, man.  That's a great move.  You need a new light, Jew. 
[01:42:00]  Well, Mr. New York Jew boy, looks like you'll quench your wipers off.  Yeah, we get it.  We got a Mel Gibson tape.  Oh, yeah.  Speaking of Jews and somebody that cannot stand them.  I love Mel Gibson.  Oh, he's amazing, isn't he?  He makes me so happy, and the timing couldn't be better.  Why?  Just because I love him.  Oh, okay.  Just happy he's just acting up.  There's no reason.  What movie got shelved of his? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  What happened with that?  He just made it?  I guess so.  I don't know why he doesn't put them out himself.  The ones he's put out himself have done very well.  Yeah, but how's he going to get it?  You could put it out, but you can't get a distributor to put it out.  Well, his movies make money, though.  Yeah, but maybe it was just a bad movie.  Yeah, that's true.  What, the one with the puppet?  Or the dog?  Or he did something that was funny.  What's the deal with this tape?  That was his last movie.  What's the deal?  This Mel Gibson tape.  Obey just starts talking right over it.  Like, don't even acknowledge him.  He asked the fucking movie, and I've seen the movie.  It wasn't important. 
[01:43:00]  Well, my friend Norton asked a question I'd like to answer.  That is true.  Okay.  Did you guys see that fucking movie with Jodie Foster?  The accused?  No, there was four of them in the room.  And they were talking about one kid bullied another kid, and the kid hit him with a stick.  It's fucking great.  You would love it.  Jodie Foster.  And the guy that played the Nazi in fucking...  Ant Cumia?  Yeah, yeah.  What was the...  In Glorious Bastards.  Yeah.  He was in it. 
[01:43:30]  Just a good fucking movie.  The guy that played the Nazi.  What's his name?  He's really good.  Yeah, he's very good.  What's the name of the movie?  Ah, something.  Something.  Well, you brought it up, though.  How are we supposed to see the movie?  It's new.  It's fucking good.  I thought maybe you saw it, and Anthony would know the answer.  Oh, sorry.  Here's Mel Gibson.  So what's the deal with this tape?  Who recorded him?  I don't even know the details on this one.  I just know it's another tirade.  It's recorded from the house, it sounds like.  It sounds like someone who's in the house... 
[01:44:00]  Why would he use a phone at this point?  Well, he's not on the phone.  That's what annoys me.  What?  Now it's just listening to Mel in his private life.  So who decided to tape him?  He was yelling at the guy who he wrote his newest movie with.  Okay.  About the movie.  And the guy's son recorded the conversation.  And there's been...  Your son.  The guy's name is Joe Esterhaus.  And there's been...  He's been talking.  He's the same guy who said that, like, Mel Gibson was yelling at him about hating Jews 
[01:44:30]  and praising the guy who killed John Lennon.  And Mel said that's not true.  He never said that.  And so now his son recorded this conversation.  Did he say anything about Chapman?  Not in the tape.  All right.  Let's listen to this.  The new Mel Gibson tape.  Why do I have hope for drought of...  What is he saying there?  Why don't I have a first draft of the Maccabees, which is the movie they're writing. 
[01:45:00]  The way he said Maccabees.  Maccabees.  Wow.  Holy shit.  The movie.  What an asshole.  What the fuck have you been doing?  I'll fight it.  Into the earth.  I will never vote.  I will never vote. 
[01:45:30]  I will never vote.  I will never vote.  I will never vote.  I will never vote.  You're getting paid.  Yes! I'm not! Yes! I have earned money, boy! This is a cocksucker who takes advantage of me!  Pause that. He said, like, I'm earning money, something, like, for a fucking bitch who takes, what?  He says, I'm earning money for a filthy little cocksucker who takes advantage of me.  Yeah, meaning his ex, I guess.  Oh, that ex.  Asana.  He doesn't like her at all. 
[01:46:00]  But he's got to yell with that waterfall in the background.  Yeah, I know, right? What the fuck was that?  Good for Mel.  It was probably the jacuzzi that he was supposed to get his dick sucked before he went into.  All I'm thinking is how annoying is it that he didn't have that first draft?  You're supposed to have a first draft for Mel? Get the fucking first draft to Mel!  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, okay!  He's a very motherfucker!  He's a hurry, motherfucker! 
[01:46:30]  Oh.  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Who wants to see?  Who the fuck wants to see?  Yo, SMBD!  Hooray!  Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Come on!  Fuck!  Fuck!  He's insane.  Fuck!  Fuck!  I really relate to that, though. 
[01:47:00]  That fucking dopey anger.  Yeah, man.  But then he goes on talk shows, and he's the lovable Mel Gibson.  Yeah.  You know?  I love him.  Not a sign that there's another version of the guy.  He's like, ah-ha-ha.  Yeah.  Ah-ha-ha-ha.  He's like any boss just getting mad when his employee fucking fucks up.  You know?  If that was on a construction site, nobody would give a fuck. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  He wouldn't say anything like, you know, you Jew or black or any, you know what I mean?  He'd just say, where's my fucking that I'm paying for?  So a kid fucking taped him?  What an asshole.  He was probably yelling at his father, though.  He's hearing his dad get screamed at.  So?  Dad could handle himself, no?  Yeah.  The Maccabees.  What a terrible name.  The Maccabees.  The Maccabees.  What the fuck is that?  I don't even want to know.  What's it about?  Uh, Jewish, uh, the fucking Maccabees.  The tribes.  Or whatever. 
[01:48:00]  I don't know a lot about it.  What?  It's a Jew movie.  Is it a Jew movie?  Yes, the Maccabees.  Oh, I thought it was a bunch of bees on the computer or something.  Wow.  Jesus.  Yeah.  The PC of bees.  Oh, boy.  The Maccabees.  You hear what I said?  The Maccabees.  Yeah, I heard that.  Oh, we all heard.  The Mac.  Mac.  I don't get it.  Why?  What is it?  What?  Give me a schlopsis.  Come on, Sam.  They were a Jewish rebel army that took control of Judea, which had been a client state of 
[01:48:30]  the Seleucid Empire.  Sounds like a fantastically interesting movie.  But I bet it really, no.  I bet, because you look at the Mayans.  I know.  That was great.  That was a great movie.  Passion of the Christ.  Mel Gibson makes great movies about that shit.  Apocalypto.  Dude, I don't want a new movie from Mel.  If it happened after electricity, I'm not interested.  You don't want anything that's happened?  I don't want anything after Christ was in high school. 
[01:49:00]  Hey, Rich, what's going on with your brother, man?  I bring it up because I listen to your podcast, My Wife Hates Me.  Well, see, here's the thing.  And I knew there was something going on with your brother, and you kept it private, but  then you talked about it on your podcast, so I feel like we could talk about it here.  Here's the thing.  I barely ever talk to my brother.  You know how sometimes you're not close?  I don't dislike him.  I don't hate him.  I just never talk to him.  I talk to him maybe once a year.  Older, younger, I'm autistic.  What's that?  You're a little Asperger-y, like you're terrible at people. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, I'm not.  I'm not.  Yeah.  I'm not Asperger-y.  I'm just not social.  There's a difference between.  No, there's not.  That's what it is.  Yeah, some say that's what it is.  Is he older, younger?  Oh, he's younger.  By how?  Like one and a half, two years.  All right.  So I really, I'm not a big, you know, I don't talk with him.  You know, he could be.  Does he look like you?  He could be.  What's that?  Does he look?  I'll control this a little bit.  Does he look like you?  No.  I don't know.  Maybe.  I don't know.  And when did you guys kind of like not talk anymore? 
[01:50:00]  I probably.  When he realized you were sucking dicks for fucking drugs.  When his older brother was wearing fucking hot shorts to drunk in his house.  Was there an issue or you guys never were close?  No, he just moved apart.  Yeah, never close.  Like he could be robbing banks, you know, every month.  I wouldn't know.  You know what I mean?  I just don't know anything that goes.  Last time I talked to him, I sent him a couple hundred bucks to turn his phone on.  Oh, shit.  You know, you just don't talk. 
[01:50:30]  You know, I.  What does he do for a living?  Nothing now.  I focus.  What did he do for a living?  He was a teacher.  Oh.  Why did he lose that gig?  Well, supposedly what I heard.  Supposedly.  Supposedly.  Right.  Supposedly.  Supposedly is right.  Supposedly.  Supposedly.  Yes.  What I heard.  What I heard through my sister.  What I heard through my sister is.  Do you talk to your sister a lot?  Not much.  I don't like her either.  I mean, I don't dislike her.  Do they like you?  No. 
[01:51:00]  I mean, I'm, you know, I mean, they have to like me because I'm, you know, I'm fucking.  Tried four times.  What's that?  Nothing.  Good.  What?  We love you, Ray.  Voss almost said they don't talk to me because I'm successful.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  And then he realized he couldn't pull it off.  You got to stop that.  His low self-esteem wouldn't allow him to say it.  Wow.  But my sister's a lot more successful.  She's, you know.  What does she do?  Fucking $2 million house or whatever.  What does she do, though?  She works at drug companies.  Oh.  Oh, pharmaceuticals.  Yeah.  Big money.  Oh, he sticks up for him, too.  She's brainwashed, you know, like, because there's nothing wrong with the pharmaceutical 
[01:51:30]  business.  Really?  That's why Merck just got sued for $1.5 billion.  Did he really?  I think it was Merck.  Is she older or younger?  I think.  I'm not sure.  Don't call me.  She's older.  So you're the middle child.  Yeah.  Damn.  Yeah, the John Brady.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  So I don't really talk to my brother.  You know, I sent him money.  And, you know, Super Bowl Sunday, when I was coming to your house for the big wild party  where you were on Twitter.  It was crazy.  That was funny, right? 
[01:52:00]  You were on Twitter.  You were on nonstop.  We were live tweeting the Super Bowl.  I know, because nobody else was watching it.  Glad that you were doing that.  Like, filling fucking people into the most watched TV show of the fucking...  I was trying to have to hear.  But I was attempting some wit.  Yeah, okay.  I wasn't just fucking tweeting facts, you asshole.  Holy shit.  I was attempting some wit.  Okay.  Whether I succeed or not is up to the fucking followers, but I was attempting wit, you dick. 
[01:52:30]  It makes it sound like I'm just tweeting facts.  Hey, by the way...  Second quarter just started.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So...  I fucking love you.  Anyway, yes.  But you were busy, too, because you were dealing with your brother.  It was the weirdest time for us to get together.  Well, I wasn't dealing with him when I got to your house.  I was dealing with Erock's fucking food tray he brought.  Oh, boy.  It was fucking horrible.  You know he got it at like 7-Eleven or Wawa.  Was it magnetic?  It was like a last minute, oh, shit, I got to bring something to the house.  Yeah.  And he brings like fucking old pepperoni and whatever, celery sticks or whatever. 
[01:53:00]  Oh.  All right.  Erock comment?  It wasn't bad.  Yeah.  Who went, ooh, olives, and dove right into it as soon as the plastic was taken off?  You did.  You?  You did.  Oh, Erock, did that blow up action?  Your stomach?  Oh, my God, Erock.  Jesus, Erock.  I was going to say Popeye.  Oh, God.  His album.  It was a nice gesture.  I'm trying to be nice.  I was only kidding. 
[01:53:30]  It was nice.  It was a nice gesture.  I'm trying to be nicer, but I don't like the shrimp trays where it's all a perfect circle  of shrimp.  I know.  I said, yeah, because they're tiny little fucking penis.  It looks like a mass grave.  Yeah.  Fucking creepy.  They're all laid out.  Yeah.  Put a little lime on them.  Even when I was fucking poor, I made sure I got a nice-sized shrimp to throw in my mouth.  Those ones you bite, you can tell they have water damage, even though they grew up in  water.  Like, it's like there's no fucking water damage.  How does shrimp get water damage?  I don't know. 
[01:54:00]  That's what the ones do.  How does shrimp get soggy?  This is fucking good.  You're right.  They're in the water.  What the fuck is that?  But I know exactly what you're talking about.  They're the fucking worst.  It's like a horrible bite.  There's no...  This isn't shrimp.  Yeah, it's terrible.  There's no crunch to it.  Do you smell them before you eat them?  I smell them.  Everyone.  You need a good snap.  Do you smell the balls first?  You need a good snap.  Like, yeah, it's got to crunch a little bit.  Yeah.  I like a good shrimp.  Water damage.  Nothing worse than those peel-and-eat shrimp. 
[01:54:30]  That you could turn into a spread without fucking doing anything.  Yeah, yeah.  Just take a knife.  A knife.  With the shrimp smears.  Yeah.  It's a spread that were fucking horrible.  Slimy.  Anytime in a round dish is just a white trash shrimp.  Yeah, that's a really good place.  There are some high-end places.  Like, I would trust one of those from Whole Foods or a place like that where they've really  disappeared.  But see, what they do is they use the tiny shrimp because no one's really eating those.  I hate those.  And they put it in a circle display.  They're fucking horrible.  It's horrible.  You want shrimp that's just fucking big.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  And you fucking...  You could pick it up and dip it into the cocktail sauce.  Right.  Bite it and pass it down.  Well, you don't even have to pass the shrimp once they bite it.  Yeah, right.  Well, you don't even have to take the tail shell off to get some more meat because it was big  enough already.  Well, those little shrimp's when you take the tail shell off, it breaks.  Yeah, half the shrimp is gone.  Because they're too weak to hold any...  And then it stabs you like a pin.  It's the fucking...  I fucking hate small shrimp.  It is horrible.  Why'd you bring it to my house?  They can't be deveined either because they're so small.  So you're eating their shit too.  I hate shrimp duty.  I hate when I see a fucking piece of brown on the shrimp. 
[01:55:30]  I'm like, I don't want to eat his duty.  You're eating shrimp duty.  It's like sawn shell.  Yuck.  It's like sawn shell crab.  When you eat sawn shell crab and that green stuff comes pouring out of the fucking...  Oh, that or lobster too with that fucking...  Oh, man.  Rich is gagging.  It's fucking disgusting.  Yeah.  You would eat that green...  Oh, Rich is literally gagging.  Can you imagine that fucking green stuff if you were...  Oh, that green mushy shit just in your mouth.  Imagine what the texture of that's like. 
[01:56:00]  It's disgusting.  Or lobster.  What are those carrot looking things in lobster?  What the fuck is that shit?  It's like two carrots are in there.  I know.  I don't know what that shit is.  You're eating their undigested food.  It's like undigested crab shit.  And king crab legs with that fucking piece of plastic.  How does plastic grow in fucking crab?  It's fiberglass.  You eat that fucking thing and it's clear.  It's like fucking plexiglass.  You can pick your teeth with it after you're done.  There's no chewing it.  If you get one in your mouth and now you've got crab meat and plastic and you're trying to  pull it out and shit's falling out of your mouth, you're on a date. 
[01:56:30]  Shoes aren't even supposed to eat shellfish.  They're shellfish.  Really?  Yeah.  And that's funny because they're always so shellfish.  They're what?  Oh.  Stupid Jews.  Stupid Jews.  Welcome to pun radio.  That's funny.  They're so shellfish.  So I haven't talked to my fucking brother.  You know, when you don't talk.  I threw the shrimp away as soon as E-Rock left, by the way.  I don't like small shrimp. 
[01:57:00]  What?  I didn't bring it.  You brought that.  What did you bring?  No, you brought the small shrimp.  Yes, you did.  Thank you.  Yeah, you did.  That's what you guys ate growing up in Florida.  I brought that Italian meat and cheese thing.  And you brought shrimp, too.  And you brought a shrimp tray because I wouldn't buy that.  I remember because people were saying, hey, look, the blimp brought shrimp.  Thank God her all didn't bring it.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  Wow. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, God.  Wowzer.  So, day of the Super Bowl.  Right.  You almost didn't make it.  I almost didn't make it.  Because you had a family crisis.  So let me.  Yeah.  Anyone else wouldn't have made the Super Bowl, by the way.  Well, no.  I took care of the crisis first.  You weren't even sure your brother was going to make it.  And you still came to my house for the Super Bowl.  It's one day a year.  Come on.  The Super Bowl.  But you didn't even have a team in the game.  You didn't care. 
[01:58:00]  I didn't give a fuck.  All right.  Sorry.  So, I get a call from my sister.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  What does she want?  You know.  She goes, my brother's in the hospital.  And I go, you know, because he's been in the hospital before, I heard.  Well, it was all of them.  So, he had a diabetic or something.  He passed out.  And they found him.  Oh, God.  But they found him, like, two days later, laying in his floor. 
[01:58:30]  He passed out from diabetes or something, not taking his medicine.  Diabetic coma.  You feel sorry for yourself.  I hope you don't do that.  Diabetic coma.  For two days, he was there?  Yeah.  Wow.  Because his last phone call was, like, on a Friday, I guess.  And they found him on a Sunday.  But I, you know.  Diabetes is a motherfucker.  It stinks, dude.  Yeah.  These guys, you know, have these diabetic comas.  Is that in your family?  Huh?  You got to hope that someone's around when it happens.  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  That's why you got to have one of those fucking medic alert things.  But aren't you in the fuck?  Aren't you worried about you having it?  No.  I went.  I've had my blood tested.  I get tested for every fucking thing.  I take vitamins.  So.  Do you?  Yeah.  Dr. Ross.  Flintstones.  So, maybe that can go in next year's Super Bowl tweet.  We're here at the Bedrock Dome.  Stop touching me, you fucking freak.  You got fucking greedy.  What's the Bedrock Dome?  I don't know.  He does get greedy. 
[01:59:30]  He tries to tag everything.  You had me.  You had me.  He wants to hold you because, you know, this is a very emotional story you're telling.  It's not emotional.  Why don't we hold him?  What do you mean, hold me?  You need some human comfort?  Why don't you tell the story?  Sam Holden.  Don't.  Don't.  Listen.  Let's just fucking get through this and we'll move on.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  I mean, this is.  Stop.  So, he might have been in his apartment for two days on the floor or something.  Yeah.  Man.  He has to have a diabetic coma.  That's a motherfucker.  So, his kidneys stopped or whatever. 
[02:00:00]  And then, you know, he lost all blood to his leg or something.  So, he's in the hospital.  You know, he's fucking in a coma or whatever they call it.  And, you know.  So, we're at the hospital.  Just look at your audience.  We're at the hospital.  What's that?  Nothing, Rich.  So, we go to the hospital and see everybody's there and stuff.  You know, it's kind of like a family reunion.  You don't get everybody together, you know.  Cigars and Scotch wants to know if he was hopping mad.  That's what he.  I don't know.  I think it was Gary Goldman said this, too. 
[02:00:30]  Gary Goldman's so fucking funny.  He goes, you try to find a card for somebody like that.  But, they all say, hey, don't worry.  You'll be back on your feet.  Right?  Back on your foot in no time.  Back on your foot.  So, you know, the doctor said we can't save his leg.  Oh, shit.  They had to amputate his leg.  You know, it was fucking.  It looked horrible.  Gangrenous?  No, the blood.  There was no surgery.  Did you see the leg before they amputated it?  Huh?  Did you see the leg before they amputated it?  No.  I saw the foot.  Gangrenous?  No, there was no blood. 
[02:01:00]  No, the Jets weren't there.  So.  Where is that leg now?  I always want to know that.  Oh.  Huh?  Where's that leg?  In the left or the right.  I would take my leg home with me.  I would just have to.  Yeah?  I wouldn't.  Keep the skeleton part of it.  I don't know.  Do something with it.  Make a lamp out of it.  Yeah.  Make everything comfortable.  Go smell it.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  Kind of put the foot bones together with the leg bone connected to it, and then there's  a socket on top.  Connected to the fucking worn out knees.  From blowing people to drugs. 
[02:01:30]  The knee bones connected to nothing.  I can't believe I got a fucking ticket for this.  Anyhow.  It's fucking unbelievable.  Why?  We're going to sell tickets though for you.  You watch what happens.  Go ahead.  So they took his leg.  So they amputated his leg.  And we visited him and stuff and brought him stuff.  And you know.  And you didn't really want to do that because you don't really have a relationship with  him.  Well, you know.  Let's be honest here.  Listen.  Here's the thing.  You know.  Look.  If he called me with two legs and said, could you take me to a supermarket? 
[02:02:00]  I told him to go fuck himself.  I'm busy.  You know.  I send him.  I would send him money if he needed it or something.  You know.  Whatever.  You do what you can.  Yeah.  So now, you know, you're going to the hospital.  It's an inconvenience.  You got to go visit somebody all the time out of guilt or whatever.  I don't fucking know.  Or just out of obligation because you're really sorry.  You're related.  Yeah.  But that's.  You know what?  Kane and Abel were related.  I don't think fucking Kane would have visited Abel in the hospital.  You know what I mean?  That's a bit of a joke.  He wasn't Abel. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  He wasn't.  He was having a mutiny.  So.  Kane.  And I feel bad for him.  He's not.  You know.  He's not a bad guy.  He got fired supposedly.  Supposedly.  Supposedly.  Why is it supposedly?  It's supposedly.  He worked in a school district where he was failing kids because they weren't.  Blowing them?  They weren't passing.  And the principal was like, you got to pass these kids.  You got to hit quotas in certain areas. 
[02:03:00]  Supposedly.  Supposedly that happened?  Yeah.  I don't believe that.  No, he said supposedly.  So it doesn't.  He's not sure.  He worked in a school.  Supposedly.  Supposedly.  District.  A school what?  District.  Okay.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  I'd sit here and you said district.  Yeah.  District.  Yes.  Relax.  You guys fucking yourself.  Why do you think we're always on you?  Relax.  Oh, really?  We're just trying to get to the bottom of the story.  Listen.  Okay.  That's what the hookers would say when Jimmy came by. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, district.  And they would say, I can't get it back.  Something with AIDS in it.  Something with AIDS.  That was a funny tweet that Jimmy made.  He goes, I was in a movie with Denzel and Tom Hanks.  Oh, thank you.  Someone said I should make a movie about my life.  So they made one star in Denzel Washington.  I was like, I was like, you're dying.  All right.  Supposedly. 
[02:04:00]  So, you know.  He worked in a school district.  He wouldn't pass them to the kids.  And I don't know that whole story.  I don't follow these stories.  How long did he work in the district?  I don't know.  So, you know, he had his life.  And it's sad.  How long did he work there?  It's a good question.  Maybe it was a shitty teacher because he was only on the job a year.  I don't fucking know because I don't talk to him.  He was always too busy fucking checking to see if his footage, but he couldn't.  Do you talk to every family member?  Right now, no. 
[02:04:30]  Okay.  Anthony.  Well, you know, you have a brother and a sister.  I talk to, yeah.  You know, and you guys are close because you were all raped in the shower together.  Jesus.  I don't remember that.  You don't?  That's a good thing, though.  But you do remember taking a shower.  My dad was teaching me and my brother how to shower.  Oh, boy.  Like men.  Is that one going to come back someday, you little faggot?  I'll bet you grabbed for his dick.  I'll bet you that Anthony saw the water dripping off it and went like, ah.  Like he wanted a drink.  Like a water fountain?  Yeah.  And your father's like, you don't be a little faggot, you queer. 
[02:05:00]  And meanwhile, it jumped.  Ah, shit.  Anthony's little hand bumped it.  Do you think?  I don't remember that.  If anybody was in court and they said to the judge, I was teaching him how to shower.  Teaching how to shower.  You don't think the judge would buy that one?  No, I don't buy it.  Oh, Jesus.  I kind of just remember being in the shower and my brother's in there and I'm in there  and dad's in there.  And he's like, nah, you take the soap, take a washcloth.  And he's just teaching how to shower. 
[02:05:30]  And I was like pinned up against the back wall.  Of course you were.  No, by myself.  Because I didn't want to get close because the water was indeed running down his body  like it normally would.  But then, you know, it kind of comes off the end of your dick and it looked like he was  taking a piss.  And I was like, no, no, you're going to the bathroom.  I don't want to like move closer.  He was like, no, here, take the washcloth.  And so I'm like, no, no.  You had to wash his genitals?  No, it was to wash myself with.  Were your little hands like the ones that were used to clean out the munitions in Schindler's 
[02:06:00]  List?  You had little hands that are perfect.  I had little hands.  They're perfect to get in those shells.  Perfect for scrubbing under my Vaz Deverns.  Vaz Deverns.  What a horrible word.  No, it was very.  Just taint washer.  It was a different time.  It was very acceptable for a dad to, you know.  No, it wasn't.  A growing boy to teach him how to shower.  No?  No.  All right.  Fair enough.  If you take a shower, you shouldn't hear.  This is our secret.  Oh, now.  Fossil.  So he calls me. 
[02:06:30]  Well, the fuck?  It's sometimes stories divert into other stories.  Fair enough.  Digress.  And it's called radio.  It's called filling four hours of fucking whatever.  How long is your podcast?  An hour?  An hour.  Every week?  Every week.  Sometimes it's more, sometimes less.  It depends when Bonnie starts crying.  About an hour is all you need to tell people.  All right.  Now, what's going on with your fucking brother?  Pieces.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Stories take forever.  How many learned anything from us?  You do those fucking reads so well. 
[02:07:00]  Thank you.  Like, we had a read, and Bonnie's in the middle of you going, how many times are we going to  mention this fucking company's name?  Exactly.  And they don't want to pay us.  Oh, see?  But we kept saying their name.  That's all that matters.  Well, some sponsors you can goof around with.  Others want it verbatim.  That's right.  Can you do our reads and we pre-record them?  Uh, no.  Okay.  Sorry.  So, so, so, my, it smells like cum air.  I was just farting.  I'm 43 and I'm not a joke.  Oh, my God.  Yes, you did.  Cum farts.  So, your brother lost his leg.  So, he lost his leg.  I don't know how he lost his teaching job. 
[02:07:30]  I mean, pretty far up, too.  Pretty far up.  That's horrible.  So, I took him.  I picked him up.  How high up?  Pretty far up.  Like, up, you know.  Past the knee.  Oh, yeah.  Way past the knee.  Way past the knee.  Yeah, yeah.  It's sad.  It's fucking sad.  You didn't even be able to get a fake leg on that shit?  I bet you can.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes you go too high.  It makes it tough to get that fake leg shit.  Yeah, no.  He'll get one.  He'll probably have to pay for it.  You know that.  So, I had to, yeah.  So, I had to pick him up from the hospital and take him home.  I had to pick up his wheelchair and his fucking walker and his, you know, where he sits in it. 
[02:08:00]  And according to Bonnie in the podcast, you were bitching the whole time.  Because he's fucking waiting to make a turn and do this and go, you know.  And then I run and get him food.  I get him a couple TV dinners and shit, you know.  I'm like, some fucking.  What a guy.  You know.  Some lean cuisine.  And then.  Why can't you get him some diner food?  Why did it have to be TV dinners?  Supermarket food for his house.  I bought him some food.  You know, cold cuts and shit.  Gotcha.  So, you know.  But what it is, is the world or society tries to make you feel that you should help a brother 
[02:08:30]  who's lost his leg.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I know.  How unreasonable.  Know that.  Listen.  I'm close when my fucking kids.  Like, my kids, I'm very close.  Okay, I would do.  So, you break through.  You know what I'm saying.  I mean, not close.  They know how to shower.  They learn on their own.  Oh, now.  And that ain't it.  Oh, my uncle Paul.  So, you know, you do what you can.  I mean, what the fuck?  You know, I'm driving around. 
[02:09:00]  And we went to visit him the other night.  He goes.  So, Raina Pryor coming in at 9.30.  Yeah, 9.30.  I can't wait.  That's going to be pretty cool.  Richard Pryor's daughter.  Yeah.  Oh, for real?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Promoting fried chicken and latkes.  What is that?  Latkes or potato pancakes.  Oh, she's a.  Yeah, yeah.  She's black and Jewish.  Right.  Oh, so she's a lot of serious.  Yeah.  So, here's the thing.  Oh, boy.  We went over to visit her the other day.  He said, can you bring me ice cream and fucking apple juice?  That's all sugar.  Diabetics.  Yeah, you can't be eating.  Oh, wow.  You're right.  So, I brought him sugar-free ice cream. 
[02:09:30]  And we get there.  He goes, I don't want that.  Hey, you know what?  We came to fucking visit you and bring you ice cream.  Wait, did you say to him, look, you're diabetic and this is what costs you your legs?  He goes, you don't tell me what I can eat.  The doctor says what I can eat.  Oh, boy.  And, you know, so.  Well, sometimes diabetics have to.  That's the weirdest thing about the whole disease.  You have to eat sugar to balance everything out.  So bizarre.  Well, yeah.  It's a nightmare.  I kind of want Richard to sign on that one.  It's like, if you lost your leg and you still want.  Yeah.  What happened?  You got the pee-pee?  Nah, I'm just twirling in my chair.  He's bored.  Richard's story is fucking taxing. 
[02:10:00]  I didn't want to tell him.  I was supposed to just say, I picked him up and spun him?  What the fuck?  You could have just said, yeah, yeah, he had a diabetic problem.  He lost a leg.  It's terrible.  And then, you know, he asked me for food and it's not good for his health.  And, you know.  You've been yapping about this for 20 fucking minutes, Rich.  I've got to say, it's amongst the most boring stories I've ever fucking heard. 
[02:10:30]  There's nothing to this.  You know what?  I want to be swept away by a story.  I think the point, quickly, is that Bonnie is fucking, you know, laughing at you because  you're so bothered by the fact you've got to take care of your one-legged brother.  That's all I was bringing up.  Oh, okay.  Plus, you were going off into some awful, like, side stories.  Like, I got him TV dinners and cold cuts.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you're just sitting through that part of the story.  Yeah, we would assume you did something like that.  Cold cuts.  Right.  Cold cuts. 
[02:11:00]  Who buys cold cuts?  I brought him three.  You bring him a container of coffee, too?  I brought him a pop-up.  A container of pop-up.  I brought him a pop-up.  Did you at least wait at the deli and get fresh cold cuts or did you get the pre-fucking-packaged  shit from him?  Those are terrible.  You're a pre-packaged shit guy, right?  Oh, no.  No, I'm not for me.  You're like, that's good enough for my one-legged brother.  To a German fucking deli.  How much protein does he need?  And say, give me a half a pound of a ham.  I want it sliced tissue paper thin, you fucking Nazi. 
[02:11:30]  You gotta go to German deli.  I love a good sub-sandwich fucking roll, man.  Fuck, babe.  Rules.  Nice fresh one.  Earl and vinegar.  This is fucking waves.  Yes.  This is riveting radio.  Dude, we're pumping up your shitty story.  Yes, exactly.  It's what we have to do.  We have to save the day, it's called.  Yeah.  You're saying that supposedly there was a problem in a school district and everybody's  going through their fucking dictionary.  I also brought him three CDs because he handed them out at the hospital. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, I'm sure.  He did.  Still empty inside.  My new CD that's on iTunes.  Oh, wow.  He wanted a couple people.  It's great about his pants.  So, look at this story.  Here's the deal.  It's his left pant leg.  Oh, God.  Is it the left one or the right one?  It's gone.  You don't even know.  The right one.  The right one.  You had to think about it.  Yeah.  You just don't get a fuck about it.  But I feel bad for, you know.  But look, it might have turned his life around.  Sometimes people need...  Yes, exactly.  Sometimes people need what? 
[02:12:30]  As opposed to going straight or backwards.  Like when he swims.  No, listen to me.  Sometimes people need to see tragedy to see the light.  You're saying some people need to lose their legs so they can get their light back together?  You never know.  People hit their bottom.  People that drink or do drugs might lose something and all of a sudden they get clean.  How could that possibly be helpful unless you open up your own online business of, like, fucking left shoe planters?  Oh, my God.  Oh, sorry.  So, you know, whatever. 
[02:13:00]  It's a story.  I don't even talk about it.  I mean, I'll talk about it probably this weekend at the Laughing Devil in Queens.  The Laughing Devil in Queens.  He's like a Terminator.  You try to stop him.  You can only stop him.  But he went right back to the story again.  Like he can stop him a little.  You know, you shoot him.  He falls down and stuff.  And it's like, oh, he's in.  Oh, he's getting back up.  No.  No.  Supposedly.  All right.  If I don't tell you this week at the Laughing Devil in Queens, next week at Joker's Wild in New Haven, Connecticut, I'll tell you. 
[02:13:30]  What is the Laughing Devil?  I've never heard of that.  Hi.  It's a new club.  It's in Long Island City.  Long Island City.  It's where Roland lives.  They're starting to build all sorts of shit there.  And one of them is a comedy club called Laughing Devil, laughingdevil.com.  And Boston is going to be there Friday and Saturday night.  Have a little devil outside, like laughing with a pitchfork.  Like, ah, he, he, he.  This guy's funny.  Tee hee.  And his cloven hooves are trapping all over the room.  And Friday, Bonnie's going to come in and do a couple guest spots with me.  Oh.  It's our night out.  How big is the room?  You two, the brand new Stiller and Mirror, you two. 
[02:14:00]  We were so bored yesterday.  This is what we did for our day out.  Were you telling that story again?  This is what we did for our day out.  Do you know Wegmans has like a daycare in it?  Wegmans supermarket.  Yeah, I know.  Wegmans?  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Isn't your brother one Wegman?  Oh, no.  He's not a bad guy.  He's really not a bad guy.  All right.  I'm sorry.  It was a dumb fucking show.  Sure.  I got fired from Wegmans.  What happened?  Because they told me you're supposed to be in produce, Paul. 
[02:14:30]  What are you doing over here with the carrot in your pocket?  Making everybody go numb, numb on the carrot like they're a bunch of bunny rabbits.  You got the lettuce at the bottom of the carrot.  They look like genitals.  Oh, my God.  Get out of here.  You're fired from Wegmans.  Wegmans?  I'll go pull your sorghum and Wegmans.  Yeah.  I got fired because they said I kept straying into the restricted area with carrots in my 
[02:15:00]  pocket.  Yeah.  Get out of produce.  Hey, look at these.  Touch the tomatoes.  Give the celery a kiss.  Yeah.  Are you a creep?  Yeah.  He's a creep.  Sure.  Can I tell you a good story?  Oh, boy.  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  No.  No.  No.  This is a good one.  What happened to me?  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  This is why you don't get married or why.  Like, when I was single for 10 fucking years and I would see comics do, oh, women are this 
[02:15:30]  one.  I'm going, eh, that's hacky.  And we'll be back.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Did you go to break?  Don't.  We went to break.  He nailed it.  No, you didn't.  Here's the deal.  We're in fucking way.  D-Rock was paying the fuck attention.  I know, right?  What's that?  Nothing.  He doesn't listen to the show.  Here, listen to this.  He didn't listen to the show.  I know he has.  He's listening to some other show, I think.  No, he's doing his WrestleMania fantasy card.  Ah, okay.  Why wouldn't you listen to the show, you're right?  He's doing the fantasy SummerSlam card.  Yeah, let him fucking be.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry about that. 
[02:16:00]  Are you doing that, D-Rock?  No.  What were you doing?  Instead of going to break when I said, and we'll be back.  Because I didn't think you were really going to break.  Ooh.  Well, that was the gag.  Someone's making snap decisions.  He's getting his get glue shit.  His fucking stickers.  He's writing down who would be in the new NWO right now.  Ew, has he ever done that?  I bet he does that stuff.  He does that.  E-Rock, how often do you just devote your life to wrestling?  Writing his own stories and stuff.  Yeah.  Do you write storylines?  He does WWE fan fiction. 
[02:16:30]  Fan fiction?  You know the name of it.  Oh, God, there's fan fiction?  I don't even know what.  All right, whatever.  Do they have like.  Do you want to tell a story now or whatever?  Do they have erotic fan fiction?  E-Rock started writing it.  E-Rock-Rotic.  E-Rock.  E-Rock-tica.  Yeah.  And it's a bunch of fucking wrestlers getting all sexy with each other.  They're not two penthouse pets ready to fuck, but then a Hulk Hogan kicks in the door.  And him and the Ultimate Warrior just fillet each other.  Yeah.  Or he beats them with a fucking empty chair from Wembley.  Wembley. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, people want to know more about the cold cuts.  They're riveted.  The cold cuts.  They're riveted.  What cold cuts did he get?  So they were pre-packaged Oscar Mayer or what?  They look like burka veils.  Did he get the shitty cold cuts with the olives in it?  No.  Were you kidding me?  So yesterday we were at Wegmans.  We're at Wegmans.  So let me tell you this.  Yeah, what happened at Wegmans?  Listen to this.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, listen to this.  We Hope a Miracle Happens by October.  My fucking wife gets...  You know how they had the buffet foods and they said you go by weight or whatever? 
[02:17:30]  So she got some Indian food.  And it was, you know, like this.  She's a vegetarian all of a sudden.  Doesn't he fucking mean just fucking up everybody's life?  Oh, wow.  I'm a vegetarian.  Okay.  So fucking...  She gets this Indian food.  And it was like...  It was a seven...  Like a $7.49.  Well, bargain at any price.  Okay, all right.  Okay, listen, Mel.  What's that, a new plane or something?  A $7.49?  It's got two extra seats on it.  So listen to me.  I go up and I pay for it. 
[02:18:00]  We go up shares to eat it.  Yeah.  It's hard.  We're paying for it now.  Dining at Wegmans?  Let's go out to lunch.  Wegmans has a new fucking...  Has a new...  It's daycare.  Wegmans in dining experience.  I love this.  Yeah.  I'm reading.  I honestly can't follow this story.  I'll tell you when he's leaving out.  We were going to eat at Wegmans.  We wanted to watch the New Year's Eve countdown.  It was a big evening out.  The Wegmans. 
[02:18:30]  Wegmans.  This is what fucking...  What's wrong with broads?  All right.  She doesn't like it.  She says...  You know, she has anxiety talking to her.  She goes, will you return it?  I go, no problem.  You know, because she took two bites.  So we go downstairs.  Returning food?  It was horrible.  And it was $8.  And she wanted to get something else.  So I go down to return it for her and do her a favor.  She comes with me.  And she's arguing with me when I'm helping her.  I go, it was $7.49.  And she goes, no, I think it was $7.14.  I go, I don't fucking know.  The lady goes, you have the receipt. 
[02:19:00]  I go, no, I didn't.  How about you just default to the cheaper price and say, I don't give a fuck.  That's what I said.  But she's contradicting me.  She goes, you don't have...  Why don't you have the receipt?  I'm going, I'm fucking returning this for you.  And why would you save a receipt for a sandwich?  You don't save a fucking receipt.  I don't save a receipt.  I'm getting angry now.  I know.  At her, right?  Thank you.  So...  Not really.  Oh.  So...  Why I'm angry at your dad.  See how we should bond.  So, whatever.  It's just that you go to help somebody and they turn on you. 
[02:19:30]  That's all I'm trying to say.  It's like you guys.  It's like you guys.  That's a third Wegman.  You ask me to tell a story and then you fucking turn on me when I tell the story.  Well, you said it was a great story.  No, you said you have a story.  We didn't say...  No, he said he had a great story.  Yeah, he did say that.  We didn't say, Rick, could you regale us with another fantastic fucking tale?  I thought maybe you guys would turn it into some anti-woman thing.  Of whimsy.  What you guys are known for.  That you would go...  Maybe we don't feel like working so hard today.  Oh, another anti-woman thing.  Well, no, you know what I mean.  How good you guys are about that.  There's a war on women right now.  We can't be saying nasty things about women. 
[02:20:00]  That's right.  I'm not sure if it's the Democrats or the Republicans.  Who has a war on women?  Oh, I don't know.  It's the Democrats or Republicans.  I think it's Romney's thing.  Someone's got a war on women.  Everyone's in trouble with a woman at one point.  Oh, yes, they are.  Romney doesn't think that Obama treats women fairly.  How is Wegmans, the dining at Wegmans?  Is it nice?  Yeah.  Is it reasonable?  I just went for a sandwich.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Just to put the kid in the daycare.  The Radisson?  Fargo.  Do some shopping, you know.  Have a little time.  You like shopping at Wegmans?  Hey, Rich.  How's the fricassee? 
[02:20:30]  Fargo.  Yes, of course.  Fargo.  I just want to sit next to you, Rich, while we eat at Wegmans.  Maybe you could sit across from me.  I could see you that way.  Wegmans.  You took your wife to Wegmans.  You should fucking just be divorced.  She should fucking divorce you.  Thank you.  Maybe that's what he's trying.  Can we go to break now?  Pulling out all the stops, baby.  Wegmans it is.  That was a great story, but we got it right now. 
[02:21:00]  It's an amazing story.  LaughingDouble.com.  Rich Voss will be there Friday and Saturday in Queens, New York, Long Island City.  Yes.  I want to play that pilot audio before Rain Pryor comes in.  Can we do that next?  Maybe?  All right.  Good.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel.  And if you come near my daughter, guess what?  On SiriusXM.  You'll be rewarded to the cyber police and the state police.  Oh, you're there.  I just want you to know that everything about you was an offense to me and offended me and pissed me off. 
[02:21:30]  Really?  You know, you fickle cunt.  See, here's the thing with me.  I don't care.  You offend me on every fucking level.  Yeah, well, obviously.  You offend me on every fucking level.  I despise you.  Okay.  I can't get you.  Listen to me.  You have proven yourself to me.  You can't hang.  No.  No.  You're a fucking fake.  You're a fucking sham.  Oh, yeah, really?  You fucking glum cunt.  What I'm saying is...  You ingrate, bitch.  What I'm saying is...  The game's over.  He's a...  Fucking... 
[02:22:00]  Okay?  And that's it.  Really?  For real?  I hope you fucking don't sleep.  I hope you fucking waste.  Yeah, but you know what the problem with that is?  Fucking ingrate.  Holy fuck.  You know.  You fucking faggot!  Shut your mouth!  You fucking idiot!  And I'm the idiot.  Oh, I hope you're fucking...  I hope you piss puss.  It's not a real uplifting morning here.  You know what I'm saying?  Series XM.  Series XM.  The opening of the show. 
[02:22:30]  Right on.  MGMT.  Nice.  Rich Voss.  The Laughing Devil in Long Island City.  Tomorrow and Saturday.  Yeah.  LaughingDevil.com to see what they're all about.  A new comedy club.  And next weekend, Joker's Wild in Connecticut.  New Haven.  Joker's Wild.  Joker's Wild.  It's going to be wild.  Hey, I needed the guy on the computer because we got some audio on the plate for everybody.  MGMT.  Got a pilot who had his mic on. 
[02:23:00]  I believe he was flying.  Oh, right.  Yes, he was.  He was definitely flying.  He was flying his aerial plane.  Saying some shit and everyone got to hear it.  And then other pilots are trying to get his attention and turn off his mic.  Hot mic.  Hot mic.  And then the tower's like trying to figure out what plane it is.  So other pilots had to say, oh, man, it's not me.  Yeah.  It's not me talking this shit.  It was Southwestern, right?  I think so.  Southwest.  Southwest Airlines pilot had an open mic.  He's flying around and he's talking with his guy up there in the flight deck. 
[02:23:30]  And he's being a braggart.  He's being a braggart.  Braggart.  And it went out.  Everywhere.  It went out.  Yeah.  To everybody.  Other planes.  Air traffic control.  They were all listening.  And he got in a little bit of trouble, I believe.  So let's take a listen to this.  United 242, you sent a roger. 
[02:24:00]  Well, but I had Tucson, C&D, all four weeks.  And Chicago cruise, 11 out of 12, there's 12 flight attendants, individual, never the same flight attendant twice.  11 fucking over-the-top fucking ass fucking homosexuals and a granny.  And a granny?  I mean, think of the odds of that.  I thought I was in Chicago, which was party land. 
[02:24:30]  After that, it was just a continuous stream of gays and grannies and grandes.  Grandes.  Faction.  I don't give a fuck.  I hate 100% of their asses.  So, six months, I went to the bar three times.  It's six months, three times.  One with the granny and the fag, and I wish I had gone.  At the very end with two girls, one of them was probably doable. 
[02:25:00]  Everyone's hearing this.  That's the granny and the fag.  Everyone is hearing this.  He has no idea.  Oh, my God.  And the fucking flight attendants are hearing it.  Right, of course.  Oh, man.  I didn't.  Grannies, fags, and grandes.  Fag basher, turn right to 090.  Yeah, a granny fucker. 
[02:25:30]  Come down to 16.  Was he banging the grandes, you think?  Or the grannies?  Basically, bitching that.  He was pissed because he wanted to get laid and wanted to fuck some of the flight attendants,  but they were all gay or grannies or, what did he say, grandes?  Grandes.  Grandes.  It's a fatty.  That's great.  A fucking, man, I've got a plane full of fucking grandes.  I mean, his language might be a little salty, but is he speaking the truth or what?  You guys fly a lot. 
[02:26:00]  What happened to the hot-looking fucking stewardesses?  I get old men.  I'm going, what happened?  What happened?  What did he go wrong?  Like, you try to profile him, and you're going, what happened?  This man is fucking 52.  He's old, and he's walking up and down the aisle with a tray.  Anything sadder than the old guy at McDonald's?  Oh, man.  McDonald's is a different ballgame.  It is sad.  Oh, man.  Not down there drinking milkshakes at McDonald's.  McDonald's?  We had a fucking pilot later.  It's your life that you're now at McDonald's as an old white guy. 
[02:26:30]  I had a fucking pilot last week going to Indy, and he was trying to be funny, and he's  telling these horrible jokes, which is bad enough that there's people on the plane laughing.  I'm going, if those people ever saw me, they would hate me live if they're laughing  at this fucking horribleness.  It's just fucking, don't be funny.  Fly the fucking plane.  We don't want to hear your jokes.  Maybe he wants to be a fucking funny man.  Yeah, maybe he wants to make everybody's flying experience.  What airline?  Ha, ha, error.  You can say whatever. 
[02:27:00]  Chuckles.  It was the ones that just took over the other one, but they say it's a merger, even though  it's not.  Continental United?  Yeah.  Well, I heard Continental more took over United, but they just can't say it like that because  it's Chicago-based United, and Obama's from Chicago, and so is Eric Holder.  Oh, shit, motherfucker.  I heard more Continental employees were laid off.  Oh, maybe that's why, because it benefited Chicago as opposed to Texas.  How old is this story, by the way?  It's a little old.  I'm hearing it's kind of old.  Yeah, but we never-  We never played it, so who gives a shit?  It's just one of those things I ran across a couple days ago, and I went, holy fuck, 
[02:27:30]  we never did this, and this is great.  How old is it?  So I apologize if you've heard this before.  I'd never heard this before.  Yeah.  Can you back up slightly?  Is that it?  And it's still fucking good.  Okay, there's some girls showing her tits.  Oh, there you go.  I'm looking at girl tits.  Yay!  Flash your tits while I listen.  It's great.  Listening to a fucking pilot while I look at the girl's tits.  That's a perfect situation.  Yeah.  Hit play on this. 
[02:28:00]  At the very end with two girls, one of them that was probably doable, but we ended up  going to the bar and then to the crew in St. Louis, and all these two women wanted to  do was one wanted to berate her sister, and the other wanted to bitch about her husband.  Literally.  For three hours, me and the FO, when that was done, 2.30, got back to my room.  I'm like, why the fuck did I step?  Okay, love his transmitting.  Bill, watch what you're saying.  But there was still a bullpen.  You know what I mean? 
[02:28:30]  I still wouldn't want anyone to know if I had begged him.  Someone's trying to key over the guy's mic right now.  That's the guy trying to help him out, and someone's keying their mic down to just try  to cover up what he's fucking saying and trying to get in there.  Hear the guy say you're...  No.  Obviously not.  Hey, idiot.  Everybody's here.  Anybody fucking talk about this.  Watch your language.  What a fucking dolt.  Did he fire this guy?  He's just rambling on and on.  I wouldn't doubt he would have some type of fucking repercussions here for what he's saying. 
[02:29:00]  Let's play this.  Yeah, I want to hear that.  I wanted to know if I had begged him.  So, I mean, it was a complete disaster for six months.  Now I'm back in Houston, which is easily one of the ugliest bases.  I mean, it's all these fucking old dudes and grannies, and there's like maybe a handful of T-chicks.  Okay, someone's got a stuck mic and telling us all about their endeavors. 
[02:29:30]  We don't need to hear that.  Houston, SkyWest 685, we were 19-5 for T-3-0, and that was not us.  SkyWest 6285, Houston Center.  Roger, climate and maintain.  Flight level 3-6-0.  3-6-0, SkyWest 6285.  Yeah, they're all trying to just, hey, it wasn't me. 
[02:30:00]  Roger, I didn't think that was you.  Oh, wow.  That wasn't us, Tower.  But, boy, how about those niggers? 
[02:30:30]  And how about, what do you think went through that guy's mind when he saw that open mic light?  Oh, my God.  Just trying to think of what he said.  Trying to flashback, like, oh, boy, what did I say?  Maybe nobody paid attention.  People are saying there's pilot rules, and a lot of people are saying they're hearing it for the first time.  I would, yeah.  Yeah, that's a good pilot right there.  How can you get fired for speaking the truth?  Got a swagger.  Yeah.  That's Chuck Yeager right there.  That's a Chuck Yeager kind of man's man.  It's the guy you want flying your plane, right? 
[02:31:00]  Sure.  Although I think the lack of sleep is a little, you know.  He's like, I should have done.  You know, he's probably sitting there like, bah, look at you, fat broad.  This old broad, some gays.  He's hung over with no pussy juice on his fingers.  Damn it, why don't I just fucking go back to my room?  Why is there a hot girl on the side of that plane?  Yeah, what airline is that?  Southwest.  Southwest has a bikini broad laying down.  Later on in the month, Southwest Airlines flight attendants were set to file discrimination charges against Southwest Airlines for pilots tirade. 
[02:31:30]  See, that's what's wrong with you fucking broads.  So what?  Guy's expressing his opinion.  Yeah.  A bunch of Grandes.  You know, yeah.  I'm sure.  I don't know for sure yet.  I'm sure.  Oh, maybe no one ratted him out.  You know, maybe it was like, well, we don't know who the fuck it was.  Yeah.  Oh, they know.  The people on the plane.  They go, that was our plane.  Well, no, they don't know.  It wasn't over the intercom.  They weren't hearing it. 
[02:32:00]  No, I thought they were hearing it over the intercom.  You thought I was like, oh, I thought it was going over the planes.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to level off at about 35,000 feet.  And then I'm going to tell you a few stories about these fucking queers and these women that are fat and old.  And how I was trying to get laid before this flight.  I got no sleep.  Just hanging out at the hotel bar.  And let me tell you, these cunts wouldn't fucking put out.  I needed a piece of pussy so fucking bad.  But the place was full of fags and old broads. 
[02:32:30]  And fat broads.  And fat broads, too.  Thank you, co-pilot.  And, yeah, we're, you can unbuckle your seatbelts right now.  Walk freely about the cabin.  The cabin that's full of old fucking skanky cunt and fags.  No, that was fucking picked up by the ground.  Yeah, that's air traffic control.  Other planes flying around.  If it's not going out to the people, then it's just going out to fucking the rest of the... 
[02:33:00]  It's not a deal.  It's going out to other...  And other planes were hearing it?  Yeah, but not the people, though.  Well, that would have been funny if there's some woman back there.  But, I mean, you kind of make a good point because it was among the pilots.  So one of those pilots had to ride him out.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, if it was going out to the plane...  They could have kept it among themselves, but amongst themselves.  If it was going out to the people, when you say his mic was on, I thought the people could hear it on the plane.  No, no, no.  The people knew.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You know.  No.  So then it's really not...  Who gives a fuck?  That's nice language.  Who gives a fuck? 
[02:33:30]  This guy's fucking talking about...  Pussy.  ...flight attendants and pussy and...  Yeah, but he's talking to another pilot.  He's not talking where...  Big deal.  Yeah.  It's not going out to the customers.  Well, yeah, but...  So then it's not a big deal.  It's like if you and him sat around...  It's still a big deal.  No, it isn't.  Why is it a big deal?  Yeah, when the mic's on.  Yeah, because he's...  It was a bad move.  You know, you expect the pilots to be talking about, you know, their course and fucking equipment  in there.  It's a fucking tower, 10-hour flight.  What are you going to talk about?  Switches the whole time?  I agree with you, but... 
[02:34:00]  Hey, look at that light.  Look at that light up there.  Look at that button.  They can't let you go if that shit happens, though.  Yeah.  I agree with you, but...  Yeah, I do, too.  I think it's funny.  If it was a safe flight, landed properly, blah, blah, blah, then who can...  I don't give a fuck if this guy's trying to get laid.  They made it public by doing that, the fucking dumb airlines.  Yep.  They make their selves look bad.  Goody two-shoes.  They are.  They fucking...  They snitch on themselves.  One of those guys who's a goody two-shoes.  Goody two-shoes.  Some fucking...  Goody two-shoes. 
[02:34:30]  Can't call Rich's brother that anymore.  It's terrible.  I'm sorry, Rich.  It's just a nasty thing to say.  That's very funny, though.  A goody stapled pants.  Remember I mentioned white guy at McDonald's?  McDonald's.  Someone goes, hey, whatever happened to Leonard?  That's a very good question.  Do you remember Leonard?  Was he the old guy?  That celebrated 50 years at McDonald's.  50 years at McDonald's.  What did they give him for that again?  Just some horrible... 
[02:35:00]  What a milkshake, I assure you.  A watch, I think.  A watch and they gave him a day off or something?  One day off, yeah.  Something like that.  No fucking way.  For 50 years?  50 years.  We talked to Leonard.  Did he have stock in the company?  No.  He had nothing.  He was lower stock.  He was shit on.  Yes.  Poor bastard.  Oh, fuck.  Is Leonard still at that McDonald's?  I believe he is.  Yeah.  Nice company.  No way.  What company?  Billions of dollars and they give him a fucking watch and a day off.  I call it Black Donald's. 
[02:35:30]  It's always that boom, ticam, bam, coming to McDonald's.  You ever see that?  It's like the real soul kind of commercials.  Occasionally they have the white ones where it's like, you know,  they have the American kind of music and stars and stripes.  And then there's, boom, town, yeah.  Get an Egg McMuffin.  Mm, mm, mm.  So good.  Bring your book in. 
[02:36:00]  There's Leonard.  Oh, that is him.  Yeah, yeah.  There's good old Leonard.  He's not still there.  No fucking way.  Well, he did 50 years and we just talked to him like two years ago.  So he probably is up to 50.  What else would he be doing?  Of course he's still there.  I thought he was retiring.  Didn't we try to like get him fired?  Tried to.  You told him he was fired.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Got the bit.  You said he was, Anthony.  Was it a good bit?  It was really good.  It fell miserable.  No, no.  It really succeeded.  Oh, good. 
[02:36:30]  Anthony said he was calling from corporate.  From corporate headquarters of McDonald's.  McDonald's.  McDonald's.  I think you said they were going to go ahead and let him finish up the day there.  But then that would be it for him.  Did he buy it?  I don't remember.  Yeah, he was like a little bit, you know.  Yeah, he was a little bit, you know.  Funny.  I think you have to be to work at McDonald's that long.  Good enough for the highlight reel?  Yeah.  It was really good.  People still talk about it.  You want a break before rain prior?  Sure.  I got to take our leakies.  That sounds like a good idea. 
[02:37:00]  I'm sure Sam will hand me some more paper I have to read.  Oh, no, my friend.  That's it?  I could lay back and just fucking hang like the rest of you guys?  I'd clear him out in the beginning in that way.  Oh, thanks.  I got to thank Steven Singer.  I got another ring.  Oh.  Free.  What?  I don't have to pay a fucking dime.  That's a payola.  Those people at Steven Singer, holy fuck, they do the right thing.  I don't think you should be saying that.  Free, man.  I didn't have to pay for nothing.  Free.  Free, free, free.  He's not going to give you free, free, free. 
[02:37:30]  But he's going to give you a good deal and good service.  You're just plugging him.  Yeah.  Oh.  And he gave you free merch.  That's totally illegal.  That's a firing offense.  Oh, God, please.  Oh, Billy, Billy, Billy.  I'm just saying he's a good guy.  I mean, he is a good guy.  That doesn't mean you should.  I should have done it during the live read to kind of hide it a little bit.  Yeah, and you shouldn't have admitted that you got it for free.  Free, man.  I don't have to pay a fucking dime, man.  Righteous. 
[02:38:00]  Someone needed a ring because they might have gotten engaged.  Who?  So fucking Stephen Singer did the right fucking thing.  He's a good egg.  He is a good egg.  Him with his dumb fucking roses.  Hey, Anthony, I played a golf course and four holes were inside the Indianapolis Speedway.  And you could hear the cars zipping around.  Really?  Yeah, the four holes.  It's called Brickyard in Indianapolis.  And four holes go into the speedway.  What if one gets loose and fucking starts bouncing on the track?  What?  What?  A car?  Can that happen? 
[02:38:30]  No, the ball.  What if a golf ball goes flying and starts bouncing down the track?  I don't know.  Is that dangerous?  I think it would be dangerous.  I think it would be.  A fucking Indy car in a golf ball meeting?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Four holes at this golf course go into the...  Those racetracks are that big?  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's fucking...  Those cars were fucking...  Was it in the infield?  It was on the inside of...  I don't know.  Take a look at the picture.  You were there, motherfucker.  Were they circling you?  Yes, you could hear them.  Then you're on...  Yes.  Howard, did you get onto the infield of the track to put... 
[02:39:00]  A tunnel that goes up there and up.  Oh, you had to go in the tunnel?  Yeah, in a tunnel.  So you went through the tunnel, and then you're playing golf on the infield of the Indianapolis  to the speedway.  Did you possibly get a ball on the track?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  No, you'd have to really slice it out of the way to hit it onto...  Like, more than the worst hacker?  I would assume it would have to be impossible, or else they wouldn't do it.  Yeah.  Like, I can't imagine they'd even take the chance that a car doing upwards of 220 miles 
[02:39:30]  an hour can have any contact with a golf ball.  And the golf ball's bouncing willy-nilly on the track.  Yeah.  Donk.  During races, they probably...  I think they closed the holes.  Oh, you think?  I thought you said you heard cars, though.  No, they were practicing.  Even practicing, it's still dangerous, right?  I would assume they do close the holes when they're having an actual race.  It's fucking cool, though.  I play with a fan that listens to you guys.  Fascinating.  Yeah.  He's good.  And he was loaded.  He was like a real person. 
[02:40:00]  No, he's real.  He owns hotels and everything.  Assume by loaded.  No, it was fun.  Oh, boy, I have nothing today.  I need...  Oh, Rich is going to be calling you.  Rich, you're good.  Rich is going to be calling you, O.P.  I had a couple good lines in the beginning, but I didn't know.  I have no stories.  I don't prepare, you know.  I go in the fucking radio...  You take us for granted, I think.  What's that?  You take us for granted, I think.  No, I don't.  It's just like...  I bet you prepare for the Bob and Tom show.  Yeah, you probably do.  No, I don't prepare for any radio.  No?  Because it usually comes naturally... 
[02:40:30]  Either way.  Oh, that goes without saying.  Yeah.  No, you have these new lights.  I fucking like them, man.  I feel like I'm on the set.  I'm just kidding.  We're talking about studio lights.  You're right.  You suck.  We're back here.  It's nice.  Hello?  Fucking embarrassment to me.  Hello?  You look like a fucking bitch on heat.  What do you want to talk to?  And if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll be your fault.  Why'd you go out and fuck your mother, you son of a bitch?  You'd be a nice guy, ain't you? 
[02:41:00]  Hello?  Stay on this phone and don't hang out for me.  I can't.  I have plenty of energy to drive over there.  Huh?  What company do you want?  You should just fucking smile and blow me.  Yeah, come over here.  I'll suck your prick.  I deserve to be blown first.  Sure.  I'll cut your fucking prick off.  Blow me first.  Well, you motherfucker, cocksucker.  Why don't you come over and talk to me person to person?  Hello?  You need a fucking bat in the side of the head.  But you ain't got the nerve, you fucking bum. 
[02:41:30]  No, no.  You're all angry now.  Come on down, you son of a bitch.  I'll give you a $50 reward.  Why don't you come down, you yellow son of a bitch?  For what?  You motherfucker, bum.  Fucking blow me, bitch.  If anybody would say that to me, I'd come down and fight him.  Fuck you.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  What's that?  On Sirius XM.  We all live in a yellow son of a bitch.

[02:43:00]  Are you going from Cincinnati to Cleveland or are you coming back?  It's fucking four hours away.  It's a week later.  Why don't I sit there all week and do what?  What is it?  The 1800s game?  1800s.  He's going to get on a stagecoach?  Where's our guest?  What are you talking about?  Where's our guest?  Skyline Chili.  Where's our guest?  She got scared and ran.  Aw.  Thank you.  Or she's right there.  Ah, here comes Roland bringing our guest in.  And Rich will play golf next week, hopefully, finally. 
[02:43:30]  These aren't standing up.  Rain Pryor.  First time on the show.  Hi, Rain.  Hello.  Take a seat.  Welcome.  Make yourself at home, as they say.  Rich Voss to your right.  Jim Norton to your left.  Anthony Opie.  Hi.  How are you doing?  How's it going?  We're actually on the air.  Hey, look at that.  Hey.  That's how we work.  We just go, ah.  That's awesome.  Come on.  Why not?  Just jump right into it, right?  We call it casual, but it's more unprofessional, we like to say.  I like it.  I have your book, but I haven't read it yet. 
[02:44:00]  Well, that's good.  That's pretty cool.  At least you have it.  Yeah.  I just want to start off with a non-statement.  It's a great place to put coffee.  Oh, no.  I'm going to read it, actually.  I was looking through it.  It actually looks really good.  I just have a bunch of books that I'm obsessed that I have to get to, and yours is one of them,  and I haven't read it.  All right.  That's all right.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  Do you get tired of hearing, like, because every comic tribute should add.  Yes.  I do not get tired of it.  You're not, right?  No, I love it.  Who was your dad?  A guy named Richard Pryor.  Aaron Pryor.  Aaron Pryor.  Exactly. 
[02:44:30]  Hilarious.  Did he ever see you do stand-up?  No.  He wanted me to do stand-up, and I said no, because he's Richard Pryor, and I got tricked  into it two years ago, and by then he had already gone, so now I'm doing it, and I think  I'm crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  It's got to be hard with, like, it's like whenever  you come with a big last name, I mean, it's like there's an additional pressure that most  acts don't feel coming out.  Exactly.  Like, they're allowed to bomb, and I'm not, so I've had to find my place where I cannot  do well, so I can get better at it. 
[02:45:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So that's been a neat process for me, and I'm like, look, if you came to see my dad run  a video, because I do a different kind of comedy, I would say.  Could you change your last name just to get some time where people maybe don't recognize  you?  Most people do recognize me, so.  Yeah.  No, I know.  I mean, that's the thing.  I mean.  You're kind of stuck.  Seinfeld.  That'd be a good last name.  That would work.  It would work.  Do you do the LA, like the alternative room?  Are you in LA?  No, I'm not.  I'm in Baltimore. 
[02:45:30]  In Baltimore.  Yeah, so I do a lot of the white trash rooms.  Well, do you, I just came from, I was just there, in Baltimore.  There's a good room there.  The Mugubi's.  I've done Mugubi's.  I'm friends with Andrew Unger and Mark Unger, so I've done Mugubi's.  I've done, what's the, Comedy Factory.  Yeah.  That's a fun club where they get free there.  I've done Arlington Draft House.  Isn't it great?  I love it.  That's a great place.  Yeah.  I love it.  And it's a weird, you know, weird trip.  I just headlined, actually, in, at Catch a Rising Star. 
[02:46:00]  In where?  In Princeton.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that still there?  Yeah.  Yeah, and I'm doing Sarcasm soon, and yeah, so it's been a trip.  You smell really good.  Thanks.  I try.  Very floral.  It's my cigarettes, thank you.  Where's Sarcasm?  In Cherry Hill, New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So, good.  Good.  Italians and Jews get what I'm doing, so it's a lot of fun.  That's what your play is about, right?  Because you're, I mean, not being black and being biracial.  In business, your father was black.  We know that. 
[02:46:30]  And I don't think I know who your mom is.  Your mom is not Jennifer.  No.  Jennifer, I remember.  Oh, yeah.  There we go.  No, she was, you obviously don't like her.  She was, one of Richard's wives.  If you want to say that, go ahead.  Is she the one, the woman who was walking in and live in concert?  I don't ever get back a cop on ya.  You don't like to talk about her?  No.  You hate her?  I don't hate her. 
[02:47:00]  I just, she doesn't exist.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did your dad watch other comics?  For all of us.  She doesn't exist.  Did he watch other comics and like, like he goes, I like this guy or I like that guy?  He, um, he appreciated Eddie Griffin.  He appreciated, um, Eddie Murphy until Eddie Murphy did the Coke and the Smile joke.  Um, he, yeah.  Why did he not like that?  Cause he was, he was, oh, he was doing it as Richard, Smashing Cosby.  Yeah.  And my dad's kind of like, you know, you're supposed to be my friend and now you're kind  of, he felt it like a diss and a disrespect rather than this is a joke. 
[02:47:30]  Do you know what I mean?  Cause my dad's like, if, if you ever heard his comment, he never made fun of other people  in the business.  Like he wasn't that guy.  So when it happened to him, he was kind of like, Whoa, I don't know how this feels.  Did he think Murphy was, was Murphy shitting on him or did Murphy really love him?  I think Murphy really liked him.  Murphy came to the house and I freaked out.  I was like, Oh my God, Eddie Murphy's here.  How old were you?  12.  Wow.  Yeah.  So I freaked out.  I was really excited, you know?  Um, yeah.  So I think Eddie really did appreciate my father and likewise, it was like a new, you 
[02:48:00]  know, scene himself kind of in this young man.  He said in one interview that they didn't click that they didn't, did he say click or they  didn't?  Jive well.  Yeah.  Well, I think that was part of it.  I think when he did that, it was kind of like things shifted.  Oh, okay.  You know what I mean?  Am I, you know, that's, that's one of the things I think that's great about fried chicken  and latkes.  My show actually is that I tell you a little bit stuff about my dad that maybe you didn't  know other than if you read the book. 
[02:48:30]  So, um, yeah.  So in, in that opportunity, you get to see, like I do him live in concert, actually that  1979 concert, I do part of it in my show as him.  So, you know, I think I can, which is cool.  It's weird though.  It's like, I guess it's a good thing in a way because, because people are interested  in what you have to say before they know you just because it's like, there's something  to talk about before you, but it's also hard because then you're like, all right, I have  to talk about this part of my life.  But I don't, which isn't, I lead up to it and it's not a big section. 
[02:49:00]  Like he's a, he's a part of this section because there's so many different, um, weird people  in my life.  So they kind of fit in as opposed to like my best friend, Kelly Carlin, my sister, you  know, her show is really about growing up being a Carlin being, you know, and this  iconic dad and my show is more about being black and Jewish.  And this happens to be my father, Richard.  Daughters are best friends.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, she called, she actually contacted me after, um, her dad passed away and said,  would you be my sister?  And I said, oh my God. 
[02:49:30]  Of course.  That is so cool.  You're in a unique position.  Most people would put either prior or Carlin as, you know, one and two.  Yeah.  They always just kind of move, move it around a little bit, but you'll always hear.  Absolutely.  You know, they're on everyone's top five list and then the daughters are hanging out.  Mine's Arsenio and Brad Garrett.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Wow, Rich.  We're back to talking about comic books.  Anyway. 
[02:50:00]  Um, it's, you gotta, it's gotta be annoying to see so much of his stuff out there from  other people too.  It's like, you watch as a standup, you watch so many guys doing prior concepts.  Yes, yes.  But it was, it was original when he did it and it was real in the seventies and now  it's like, you see so much manufactured fucking third generation rage that isn't real.  Right.  You do.  And it, and it's crazy because I, people always ask me, well, who's your favorite comedian  now?  And I'm like, it's kind of hard because there's not an original voice out there.  There's no one willing to cross the line anymore because we're so, you know, fucking 
[02:50:30]  PC.  So nobody was allowed to say that.  Oh, sure.  So we don't, we don't have that thing anymore and it's weird.  It's just like, you know, I, I don't, I don't get it.  I also don't get, I mean, I love the Louis CK and you know, the Rick Overton's, but those  are old to me.  Those are the still kind of like old school in their way.  And a lot of the new guys, it's, it's kind of boring.  It's like, that's great.  But like, push it, go somewhere, tell me something I don't know, you know, and same  thing with black comedians.  I don't get the whole like, and this is how black people are. 
[02:51:00]  And then this is how white guys are.  You know, I'm just like, you know, it's kind of old.  We know that already.  Yeah.  I mean, I mean, again, it was done in the mid seventies on Richard's albums and it's  like, you're not going to say anything about race that he didn't hit on.  Right.  It happens in the news today.  But Trish, uh, you were in the audience once when he was on stage, right?  Yes.  And he loved to tell him that story about it.  Cause he said that you were really, you were a great sport and he was having fun with you.  Yes.  That was, I could not believe he said from the stage, I would love to have some Richard  Pryor pussy dog. 
[02:51:30]  That was the weirdest thing.  I was like, uh, excuse me.  So after that, every time I saw him, I was like, you ain't getting nothing.  I think your father would have loved him.  Yeah.  I think so too.  He was just in, he was such a beautiful man.  He was a really good man and he was very funny and he was a, a great thinker, you know,  so.  You mean Patrice?  Yeah.  Patrice.  Yeah.  He was one of those guys, like, and we were talking about him recently, like he was really  not overrated.  Like you could put him in a room.  I mean, a Pryor was a better comic and not to disrespect Patrice who I love, but if you 
[02:52:00]  put the, him in a room with anybody, Patrice in a room with any comic that ever performed,  he could be in that room and be comfortable and be as funny as them talking.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And which is, you know, makes him even more endearing to me.  Were you friends with, I mean, sure, you know, but are you still friends with, uh, with  Mooney?  Do you still see Paul?  No, I don't.  I mean, I'm friends.  I guess if I see him, I say hi, but it's not like I call him up and be like, Hey Mooney,  how's, you know, white people, um, he's a bit obsessed with that. 
[02:52:30]  That's hilarious, man.  Yeah.  We've had him on the show a few times and, uh, gotten into some, uh, pretty heated discussions,  but then, but then he'll look over and, and, and wink and, and let, you know, like, all  right, right.  I'm just messing with you.  Yeah.  We're just fucking around.  He has a very charismatic smile.  It's like, it's hard not to like Mooney when he says something and it's like, then he  smiles.  Farrakhan can do that too.  Well, he can fuck, he's a charmer.  I had dinner with Farrakhan.  So I know he's, that man's a charmer.  Dinner with Farrakhan.  That would be a great movie actually. 
[02:53:00]  What was that like?  It was interesting.  Cause I was actually in town.  Did he only talk to half of you?  I sat on this side and, um, basically I was there to do fried chicken and latkes, my  solo show.  And so coming to see him and going, yes, I'm doing a show about being black and Jewish.  And how do you really feel?  You know?  And he was like, you know, most people think, you know, say, I'm going to see him.  I'm a, I'm a racist or I'm anti-Semitic, but the truth is, and I was like listening to  him and yeah, it was interesting.  Would you now, did he come to your show?  Of course not. 
[02:53:30]  First of all, it was for the ADL.  So as soon as I mentioned to the ADL, they were like, I was like the antichrist in the  room.  No pun intended.  So he treated you well during dinner?  He did.  And it was a very interesting.  And he comes with his own chefs and things happen in the hotel.  And I was received.  Um, it was interesting.  I was surrounded first.  Like it was, it was almost like being the secret service.  Uh-huh.  Because a whole group of guys, the nation, you know, the nation brothers came up and  they're like, uh, sister prior, sister prior, would you like to meet the minister? 
[02:54:00]  And I'm like, who the hell is the minister?  You know, um, I felt really lame because they're like, Mr. Louis Farrakhan.  And I'm like, all right.  And they call up and then I get a phone call.  He will now receive you.  Receive you.  And I was like, ooh.  Nice.  Yeah.  That's cool.  He's got four guys, right?  He is.  And it, it, but you know, look, the nation is the nation.  It's, it's, you know, not to be confused with real Islam.  It's a, you know, it's a different form.  It's a very militant organization.  It's kind of like the, you know, uh, what is it?  The, uh, what is it? 
[02:54:30]  The Christian, um, the right?  The Christian.  Yeah.  But there's like a new group that's kind of, it's, it's the same rhetoric.  It's a switch to white people.  Ah, okay.  What, the Tea Party?  Yeah, basically.  So you've, you're pretty, you're pretty, you know,  I mean, he's just like, eh.  Oh, well, well.  I feel like I know you.  One person in the room.  Have I met you ever?  I'm just, I'm a big act.  You are?  He's a big act.  You're big.  You're here.  When you say I'm a big act and someone says you are.  Yeah.  And it's not an exclamation point.  It's a question mark.  You're a nobody.  You are.  Yeah, it's not, you are. 
[02:55:00]  First of all, here's the thing.  What?  I don't know.  Just a comic for 28 years.  That's probably, yeah.  First white guy in death cam.  Yeah, exactly.  Probably where I've seen you.  No, you're doing good after 28 years.  Hey, I think I've seen you once.  Were you on MTV's?  Yeah.  The Tim Brewer show.  He's on nights.  So, um.  I didn't mean any disrespect, by the way.  No, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're  probably accepted by, like, a lot of, uh.  Groups.  Yeah, because your father was, like, he made, he made hard people to laugh laugh.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, he, pimps and guys, like, that you really weren't associated with going to comedy shows. 
[02:55:30]  Right.  And that's because mama ran a brothel.  So that made that a lot easier.  Right.  How close were you to your grandmother?  Very, very close.  I do her in my show, too.  And, um, so I was very, very, very, very close to her.  And he loved her, right?  He really.  Yes, he did.  He did.  And she helped to raise us, you know, when we were with him.  So, and she was always very truthful.  And that's, I think, what his comedy, to me, represents.  And what we try to do in our lives is just to be as honest as possible.  Was that a rough upbringing? 
[02:56:00]  I mean, you know, because we've all heard.  It's funny.  I met Diana Ross on a plane.  And, um, all I wanted to talk to her about was prior.  I'm like, was he, was he, you know, because I'd heard, there was times where, you know,  they'd said he was a little difficult, you know, I'm sure.  Um, and I asked her and she just didn't want to give anything up.  She's like, oh, he's a genius.  You know, and she wouldn't talk to me.  You know, I guess maybe he was difficult, but he was difficult because he wanted certain  things done a certain way.  And especially, um, you know, in his first, one of the first films that actually Mr.  Melvin Van Peoples was a part of. 
[02:56:30]  And then that got switched out because my dad was, you know, kind of like, I'm Richard  But, um, but the truth is my dad was the kind of very straightforward in business and knew  everybody's name was nice to, you know what I mean?  He was that guy.  So, you know, they can say what they want about him.  I know.  Yeah.  A lot of times they're not even saying it in a bad way.  I mean, it's just, you know, they were saying there's certain times.  It was just rough.  Look, you've got to be in your trailer and smoke a joint.  Don't bug me.  You know, if I got to do a line, I got to do a line. 
[02:57:00]  I'll be there in a minute, you know, that could take a while.  So do you know, was it true that him and Harvey Keitel and, uh, Yafikota really didn't like  each other on, uh, cause you've heard, I've heard all these stories about blue collar,  which I love.  I think, which I have a picture of in my bedroom, the poster or the three of them with,  yeah, which is amazing.  I think it's an underrated movie.  And I think he was like an underrated actor.  I mean, I think like Murphy got great roles and it's like, almost like prior was a better  actor, not to knock Eddie Murphy, but I wish that Richard was a better actor.  He was though.  My dad was an amazing actor.  He's an amazing mind. 
[02:57:30]  And he studied people and that's, I think a little bit of the difference between Murphy  and, and my father.  Although Murphy has, to me has grown in certain ways.  My dad was a real artist.  And he also did like, besides blue collar, he did the, I mean, obviously, um, uh, Grease  Lightning and like all these, and Lady Sings the Blues, like serious movies that like Eddie  Murphy doesn't seem like he went into any of those areas.  No, not so much.  No.  He kind of went into kids' movies.  Yeah.  Hercules, Hercules.  Yeah.  Well, he made a transformation. 
[02:58:00]  Your dad was, wasn't he a clean act?  And all of a sudden that went, he was a clean act.  And didn't it happen when Cosby set up the showcase or around then?  He was, I know what you said.  What the fuck?  I asked, isn't, didn't he make this transition?  He did.  He went to Vegas actually.  And that's where it started to happen.  And he was like on the stage and had this moment because everyone around him is like,  you have such this unique voice, just use it.  And there he was. 
[02:58:30]  And it was kind of like the first time he kept out of the box and they're like, you don't  ever work in Vegas again.  And then there he was freaking huge after that.  Yeah.  You know, my dad was really, I mean, that was his thing.  Let me immolate who I see because that's what you did at the time.  I mean, he was the, and I think him and Carlin kind of broke that box.  Do you know what I mean?  And they became like this free form and it started a new generation of comedy.  Lenny Bruce was doing it during Lenny Bruce's, you know, moment.  And so this was the new shift away from the skinny ties and the nice suits. 
[02:59:00]  My dad came home with cocaine and a silk shirt.  But wasn't Jimmy Walker like dirty and had a lot of resentment because he turned, like  they told him, no, you got to be clean.  Like he was a dirty comic, Jimmy Walker, kind of like before your dad was.  And I think it was Gabe Kaplan or someone said, no, you got to clean it up.  And then Pryor got so famous and Jimmy Walker was fucking JJ.  And I heard, held all this resentment throughout his career that he didn't go that route, that  your dad went.  You know, and that's a, yeah, I don't even know what to say to that. 
[02:59:30]  I mean, poor JJ Walker.  I mean, you were on a series for years and everyone knows who you are too.  Yeah.  He's an angry man.  Yeah.  Well, you know, angry black man.  It's the story of my life.  But he's had a lot of time since then to improve on his standup.  And let's be honest, it hasn't been, it hasn't been phenomenal now.  Exactly.  He hasn't exactly.  He could have done whatever he wanted the last 25 years.  It wasn't successful for him.  Blame yourself.  But he was, you know, but he was a good man.  I'll tell you that much.  Jimmy Walker definitely was a good man.  Really?  I mean, not was, I guess he still was. 
[03:00:00]  I just don't know him now.  Yeah.  I was rolling through the Rolodex in my head going, is he still alive?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  I guess he is.  So your play covers, what, you're doing it?  I actually want to say, it's this weekend.  Are you only doing it this weekend?  I'm only doing it this weekend.  It's at the, how do you say it?  Abingdon.  Theater Arts Complex.  Dorothy Strestland Theater.  It's here in New York.  It's on West 36th Street.  And you can go to atrainprior on Twitter.  And I'm really annoyed that I'm not here.  No, I'm going to be, I'm going to be.  Cincinnati. 
[03:00:30]  Out of town, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Fried chicken and latkes.  What exactly is it about?  It's about growing up black and Jewish in the 19, late 60s, early 70s.  And I played different characters of that period that were in my life.  My mom, my paternal grandmother, my maternal grandmother.  You know, I cover both sides.  The Jewish, the black, my dad.  And, you know, talk about his death.  And, yeah.  What, did you, obviously you knew he was really sick.  Did you know he was about to die or was it a shock?  Yes, I knew he, I felt he was leading up to that. 
[03:01:00]  I was shocked when I heard it was a heart attack.  I was devastated by that.  But I knew it was leading up to that.  And me and my brothers and sisters, we did what we could to try to kind of rescue him from what was going to be inevitable anyway.  But we wanted to offer something different for him.  You know, and I'm very big with multiple sclerosis and advocacy for it.  And especially for those who are caregivers and the children of.  So it's a big part of what I do in my life.  Was he in a bad way at the, was he in a bad living situation at the end? 
[03:01:30]  I believe so.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, you know, as again, as this comic, you hear rumors that it just wasn't that good for him at the end because of the way he was, you know, who he was living with, I guess.  And how old was he growing up and your dad always with different women or meeting all these different people?  It's like, you know, you have your mom and then he's got this one or this one or this one.  I mean.  Right.  I, you know, I didn't know anything different, I guess.  I, I mean, you know, in hindsight, you look and go, wow, my dad was a player.  But, you know, now I don't, looking back, I don't really, yeah, I don't, it didn't really phase me that much. 
[03:02:00]  I wasn't like looking for the mommy thing from anyone else.  So I kind of was like, oh, she'll be here for a minute and then he'll get rid of her.  And I think one time me and my brothers and sisters brought him condoms because we're like, maybe you want to use this because you keep having kids.  So this might be helpful.  How many did he end up having?  There's six of us.  Six.  Yeah.  And do you remember the fire, obviously?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  I mean, when my dad went to the hospital and the doctor came out and said, Mrs. Pryor, eight women stood up. 
[03:02:30]  So that was an interesting moment.  That's true, right?  Yeah, that is true.  Yes, it is.  It was an interesting moment.  Wow.  And you're like wondering, who's the, my mom's like, oh, I know where I was.  I know that one.  Oh, wow.  I don't know if he's over here.  Yeah.  Does that change him at all?  Pussy?  No.  I'm confused by the question.  No, the fire.  I think it did for a moment.  It did for a moment.  And then, you know, he was spiraling down.  Mama had just passed away and it was kind of like part of this spiral and this cycle. 
[03:03:00]  And I think what changed in him was like, okay, I don't get to leave the planet.  You know, he wanted to kill himself.  So he didn't get to leave the planet.  God had another, you know, plan in his head.  That was his, that's what he said.  You know, that he was like, no, you're going to stay here and experience some pain.  And, um, and that was it.  So that's what he did.  Why do you want to kill himself?  I mean, mama just died.  Women, drugs, you know, it's, it's, it's, I think it's a psychology of a genius. 
[03:03:30]  I mean, they're all, they're all crazy.  And, you know, you watch them go really high and then down.  The only guy I ever saw talk to him as an equal and like all the interviews I saw was  Carlin.  Like he, he did, I think it was Larry King or whatever.  And all these comedians were calling in Roseanne and they were all just paying homage.  And the only guy that called in and he was like rich and like just shit on him for Bogart  and joints was Carlin.  Like he called in and talked to him as a friend.  He was the only guy I ever saw.  But I think cause Carlin was so real and you know what I mean?  And so he was grounded and especially, I mean, I see it in his daughter. 
[03:04:00]  So I get it.  Like we really did grow up the same people just with, you know, different dads, but these  iconic dads.  And so I, I get that.  I, I wouldn't be surprised at that actually.  Does she do standup or no?  No, but she does storytelling and she's a prolific writer.  And so that's her thing.  We've been trying to tell her to do standup cause I'm like, look, if I'm doing it and  I'm allowed to bomb sometimes, so are you.  And she's like, I don't know.  You know, it's crazy.  Why don't you guys do something together?  We want to actually, even with, um, uh, with a, uh, Lenny Bruce's daughter, we want 
[03:04:30]  to do like Daughters of the Revolution.  Wow.  That'd be cool.  Cause our dads are iconic in their, you know, in their thing.  So yeah, we want to, whether it's our storytelling and yeah.  So one day I think we will.  It's interesting just to hear the stories from that perspective.  Cause you know, we've all read the books or you heard a million things, but just to  somebody who lived with these people who has comics, I mean, none of them are around  anymore and your father met once, you know, I mean, I never got to know him, unfortunately. 
[03:05:00]  Um, so where else are you doing this?  And how can people follow you if they're not going to, uh, follow me on Twitter at ring  prior.  You can follow, you can go to my website ring prior.com.  I'd like to keep it simple.  Um, I'm also director, so I'm directing a lot of shows around the country and, and that's  what I do.  And I run a theater in Baltimore and okay.  So, so this weekend here in New York, I appreciate it.  And, um, hopefully people go out and see it.  It's a 312 West 36th street.  Um, Richard's daughter, uh, rain fried chicken and Lockheed and, um, rain prior on Twitter. 
[03:05:30]  Thank you so much.  I'm really happy for popping by.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We're ending for the day too.  Rich, uh, your plug.  Oh, this week, uh, uh, the laughing devil get my fucking CD still empty inside on iTunes.  It's great.  And the, and the podcast, my wife hates me.  All right.  Next weekend, fucking jokers in Connecticut.  Go fuck yourselves.  I don't like any of you.  I'll be in Cincinnati, uh, the funny bone tonight, tomorrow, Saturday.  And, um, next week I will be in, uh, Cleveland with the boys Friday. 
[03:06:00]  We're doing the show.  That's awesome.  Um, from the hard rock three to seven in the afternoon.  Very good.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around, After O.N.A. Live is next.  It's the Sirius X-Hash.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O.N.A. Live. 
[03:06:30]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Hey, you know what time it is.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Call me now, as Ms. Cleo would say.  And tell me what you learned on today's O.P. and Anthony Show.  Rain Pryor was just in here.  I can't imagine having the experiences that she has growing up and knowing Richard Pryor as a father instead of, like, this icon of comedy. 
[03:07:00]  It's just, it's mind-blowing.  I mean, when, you know, when you think about these people just being able to interact with Richard Pryor the way you would interact with your father, it's insane.  Like, that's how you look at this guy that everybody else looks at as a deity.  I can't picture it.  I can't picture it at all.  Today, though, on The O.P. and Anthony Show, I learned that you could watch the $10,000 Pyramid in the 80s. 
[03:07:30]  I thought that was a show strictly of the 1970s.  But apparently, as a child of the 80s, watching the $10,000 Pyramid, not $25,000 Pyramid, was okay.  I didn't know, but apparently, that wasn't a big deal.  They don't like when you notice those little pickups there, Sam.  Well, you know what?  I'm a smart guy.  I pay attention to detail, and I do pick up on that stuff.  Sal, what did you learn on The O.P. and Anthony Show?  I mean, I saw you doing a lot of nothing, so I hope you were at least listening. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  I learned, um...  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  A-Rock, what's going on with Sal?  I don't know.  Some things may be going to his head.  I don't know.  He was in there today, right?  Uh, not a whole lot, no.  He's eating breakfast.  Oh, that, yeah.  I watched it.  He's eating breakfast.  He's sitting around watching the other kids' screen calls, and now he can't even tell me what he learned on the show?  We gotta whip people into shape around here.  It's all blended into, like... 
[03:08:30]  You don't even have an excuse for not listening.  No, I was listening.  I just, I can't particularly remember anything right now.  You weren't listening.  Oh, okay, I got some, I got some, I got some.  Okay.  Here we go.  Let's see if we can make the save, Sal.  Well, Opie does a fucking killer, Edgar.  That's a good, that's a good, what did you learn?  Okay, way to make the save, buddy.  You did make the save, because he really does.  I think Opie surprised a lot of people today with a fantastic dead-on impression of Edgar.  Opie doesn't do any impressions.  No, but he's found a voice.  He does Edgar, and he does it perfectly. 
[03:09:00]  Um...  I learned something.  What did you learn today, Eric?  I learned...  Poop.  Diarrhea poop.  Diarrhea poop?  I started the hashtag, actually, on Twitter Not Sam today.  Poop, diarrhea poop?  No, just diarrhea poop.  Hashtag diarrhea poop.  And that was going wild after people saw it on Twitter.  So, uh, hopefully that will continue throughout the day.  Uh, Eric, why don't you hit...  Do you want the sweeper?  Yeah, hit the sweeper.  Let's do it.  Here comes...  What did we learn? 
[03:09:30]  What did we learn?  Let's start with Jason in New York.  Jason, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, Sam.  I learned that Rich Boss can't say district.  It's district.  Does it drive you crazy, or do you just love  when they point out...  Opie and Anthony point out something that Rich is saying wrong,  and they don't correct him for the entire show? 
[03:10:00]  He doesn't realize it.  He just...  He'll keep going on with it,  and they are blatantly saying district,  and they're even asking him,  what was that?  District?  How do you spell her?  They need to start asking him how he spells these words.  Yeah, he goes, district.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing, Rich.  Nothing.  We'll have to add that to the door.  Yeah, really.  Adam in Michigan, what did you learn?  Hi, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Hey.  Anthony said it,  and I've noticed it on my radio before.  When you guys go to commercial, 
[03:10:30]  and you get it,  you know,  jumped to whatever little spot you're hitting,  the audio is, like,  extremely higher than the actual show level.  Yeah, it was funny to you,  listening to Opie and Anthony  talk about all the complaints they have.  I don't know.  I mean, I know some people get annoyed.  Maybe it's because I'm close to the situation.  I love when they start...  Hey, Cousin Brucey, come in.  Come in here, Cousin Brucey.  Wow.  Cousin Brucey's in the house.  What's up, Cous?  We're on the air.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  It's after.  Well, kind of sad. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, Dick Clark.  I'm now doing...  talking to a lot of media about Dick.  Yeah, we were watching you on Fox News earlier today.  Sure.  Pardon me?  We were watching you on Fox News earlier today.  Oh, yeah.  It's been a whirlwind since last night.  I came in early,  and I was going to do a couple minutes  and talk in the 70s and 60s,  and I wound up doing five hours of my show on Dick.  Wow, the whole show.  Really quiet.  It was the whole show.  I would imagine.  You know, I love seeing you guys.  I would love being here,  but I'm very sad today.  Of course. 
[03:11:30]  It's a sad time.  We lost a friend,  but we have a legacy.  Yeah.  So that's what I tell people.  It's right to mourn a little bit,  but we have a legacy that nobody can take away.  What is it that Dick Clark brought to television?  What is his legacy?  You know, he brought dignity.  Yeah.  He brought honesty,  and he brought trust,  and he left a legacy.  And what I mean about dignity,  before Dick Clark came up,  it was tough for Cousin Bruce to get into people's homes.  You know, parents didn't trust us.  They didn't like this new music, rock and roll. 
[03:12:00]  Really?  I mean, oh.  Well, you know,  the ruling generation,  the generation with the power,  never likes to change,  and it's obvious that a big tidal wave was coming.  And this was around when?  Like, what bands were popping off right then?  Oh, we were talking about the Everly Brothers,  Bill Haley of the Comets,  Jerry Lee Lewis.  I mean, you know,  you shake my name and you rattle my name.  You know, the kind.  I've never heard of a thing like this.  And that was too much for adults at that time.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it was so different  than watching and listening to Dora's Day  or Victor Moan, right? 
[03:12:30]  Sure.  Or Sivato or Tony Bennett.  You know, it was very, very different.  But this belonged to the kids,  and they didn't want that too much.  So here comes a guy out of Philadelphia,  a beautiful smile,  twinkly eyes,  gorgeous little face,  and nice,  his body language is great.  And parents are looking at this guy on television,  and his persona went past the glass.  Yes.  And they trusted him.  So he gave us trust.  And because of him,  we got trust.  And amazing.  The music changed.  He was very nurturing, by the way.  And very honestly, 
[03:13:00]  knowing him all these years in business  and as a business friend,  what you saw on television is what you got.  What was your relationship with him?  Right from the beginning.  Yeah.  You know, we used to change telephone calls.  He'd come and sit on my shows  on other stations.  Oh, yeah.  And up here.  Oh, yeah.  We'd sit and we'd talk.  We'd talk radio and we'd talk music.  He loved the music.  You know, he started,  he was about 17 years old.  He started on radio.  Wow.  He was a local kid.  He came out of, I think,  Mount Kisco,  that area.  So he was doing local radio.  Right here.  And he went to Syracuse University. 
[03:13:30]  And he believed in it.  Yeah.  Everybody I had on the air last night with me  said one thing about him.  Honesty and nurturing.  He was very nurturing  to all of the acts that came on the show  because they were all very young.  And they were scared stiff.  Yeah, sure.  Scared stiff.  And he would always help them  and tell them,  look, let's study the lyrics.  I want you to do this.  And he gave,  but he was very positive.  Dick Clark gave us hope  and he was very positive.  And I'll always love him.  One of the callers wants to contribute.  I don't know if you want to  throw those headphones  close to your ear  so you can hear them. 
[03:14:00]  Yes, caller,  you're on the air  with Cousin Brucie.  Brucie, I'm a huge fan.  What a loss we've had  with losing Dick like this.  How,  did Dick have an influence on you?  Oh, absolutely.  As we just discussed,  if it wasn't for Dick Clark,  I'm going to sit down here  for a minute.  Sit down, make yourself at home.  It's been a long couple days.  It seems like a couple days.  I bet.  Dick Clark,  Dick Clark,  losing Dick was huge  for everybody.  Yeah,  and he was very important  for Cousin Brucie. 
[03:14:30]  Now, let me just tell you about it.  Absolutely.  You just thought Dick was going to...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were always going to have Dick,  but now,  you know,  no Dick.  That's right.  There's no Dick Clark.  But you know something  that is not true?  Let me back up a little bit.  First,  let me answer your first question.  Very important.  Yes, sir.  What was the influence  he had on me?  He gave me hope  and he gave me a dignity.  Because when he went on television  and he really dignified the music,  you know?  Yeah,  the whole image.  His image.  You got hope from Dick? 
[03:15:00]  Listen,  How did you get...  I just want to know  how you actually got hope.  Well,  let me tell you.  How did you hope?  I'll tell you.  Okay, sir.  I'm sorry.  It's all right.  Listen to me.  And then,  you know,  I'd like to see you agree or not.  When I watched Dick Clark on television,  I knew that everything  was going to be all right.  It's like,  you know,  it's like seeing a fun neighbor  who comes home from vacation  that you want to see  or a cousin.  Yeah.  Or a parent who comes home  and they give you hope  and they say,  everything's going to be all right.  That's what I mean by that.  So he gave us this kind of feeling.  Yeah.  Right?  And the dignity he gave 
[03:15:30]  to rock and roll  was very important  to guys like me  because people wouldn't accept us  in their homes.  Parents did not like  Cousin Brucie.  Right?  No, no.  You were a rebel  and so was Dick.  Exactly.  Yeah.  But Dick had one thing  none of us had.  He had this persona  of the boy next door.  You know,  I've got to tell you something.  Every parent wanted Dick  to marry their daughter.  They wanted him.  What?  They wanted Dick Clark  and their families.  Right.  They wanted Dick  for their daughters.  Oh,  for their son-in-law.  They wanted,  yeah, 
[03:16:00]  they wanted this guy  in their family.  You know?  You know so much about Dick  and it's amazing  and you are the guy  that everyone's going to  in the media today  to talk about Dick  and just hearing that  that's a good compliment  that guys would love  Dick for their daughters  because that's how,  that's the kind of man he was.  Exactly,  he was  and he was  right in the family.  He became in the family  and over the years,  and let me tell you,  let me tell you  the other side of Dick Clark.  There's two Dick Clarks,  right?  Two Dick.  Yeah,  listen to this,  two Dick Clarks, 
[03:16:30]  okay?  Let's say two Richards.  Two Richards,  yeah,  yeah,  clarify it a little bit.  That sounds better.  Listen,  so two Richards,  there are two Dick Clarks.  The Dick Clark,  the guy,  the guy that we knew  on television,  the guy that,  I would come home  after school  and before I said  hello to my mother,  I would turn on television  and say,  hiya,  Dick.  Like,  I'm watching him on television  and then I'd say,  oh,  hi,  Mom.  Yeah,  he was there first.  He was there first.  I'm afraid  all right,  it's enough for the Richards.  Last night,  I had people, 
[03:17:00]  a lot of people  on my show last night  and I wanted to talk  about Dick Clark  because when you lose  a family member,  you have to have somebody,  you know,  to console you  and to hold hands  and all these artists  that came on,  people like Tony Orlando  and Leslie Gore  and Betty King  and on and on and on  and on,  people like Neil Diamond  who he helped  and Paul Anka  and all the early acts,  they all had one thing  to say about him,  he was nurturing,  he took care of them,  he believed in them  and he took very good care  of them  and that's important  and I want you to know  about that too. 
[03:17:30]  Then the other Dick Clark  was the businessman.  Right.  Now this guy,  let me tell you,  not like you see on television,  this guy was tough,  straightforward  and what he wanted,  he wanted,  you didn't get in his way.  If he believed in something,  he would go full steam ahead  no matter what anybody  believed in.  He believed in himself  and that was Dick Clark  but Dick Clark off the camera  was the same  as what you got on camera  and that's important to know.  This was a wonderful,  nice human being  and warm  and gave us hope.  He talked about too, 
[03:18:00]  we were talking about  on the show today,  the racial divide  that went on in music.  Dick Clark kind of  brought in a lot of artists  from different ethnicities,  black artists  into white homes  and saying it's music.  You know,  that's a great comment.  I'm glad you brought that up  because several times  I've talked to Dick  about that,  about if he believed  as I believe  that music belongs  to the universe.  There's no race in music.  There's no black music.  There's no white music.  There's no red music.  There's no yellow music. 
[03:18:30]  It belongs to everybody.  If you love the music  and you can feel it  in your heart,  it's not racial.  I'll tell you a quick story  about Benny King  told me last night.  I was one of the  original drifters  and, you know,  songs by Stand By Me.  I mean,  huge, huge hits.  Benny told me that  when they were on  these cavalcade of stars,  they used to go out  on these buses  and they went to some places  that were not,  how would you say,  enriched with the social phenomenon  of accepting people  no matter what  their skin color is.  So we'd get to some  of these towns,  maybe down south 
[03:19:00]  or in the Mideast  and the Midwest,  and the producer  would come over  and say,  well,  the black guys  have to stay  on the black groups  on this side of the stage,  the whites on this,  and they can't be  on stage together.  Wow.  Well,  listen to this.  Dick Clark gets up there  and he says,  my friend,  unless my acts  can do what they want to do  and they're on stage together,  it's music,  we're leaving.  That's a true story.  Yeah,  and he'd get on the bus,  he'd pull everybody out,  he'd put them on the bus  and they'd leave  and they'd usually win the battle.  Yeah,  that's a true story  about Dick Clark.  Did he ever have to cancel shows? 
[03:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  And he was willing to.  Oh,  he was absolutely willing to  because he was a man  who believed in people.  If he loved something,  he went all the way,  100%.  And Dick Clark  was that kind of man.  He believed in people,  he believed in what he was doing.  Well,  look at him,  you know,  the last several years  on television.  Yeah.  If that wasn't Dick Clark,  it was New Year's Eve,  he would not have been  on television.  He was strong,  he knew the audience  wanted to see him  and he represented something.  And he had a passion  for it,  obviously.  I mean,  he never stopped broadcasting. 
[03:20:00]  You said he started  when he was 17.  He was about 17 years old.  He was a kid announcer,  you know.  Yeah,  who did this for 60 plus years.  You know,  I asked him once,  I said to him once,  what do you like better?  You like radio or television better?  You know what he said to me?  Why?  Both.  You know,  and then he smiled  with that great grin,  you know.  Yeah.  Very,  very smart man  and really had the heart and soul.  Is there anybody there left  that you think can continue  on this legacy?  Interesting.  How many people have asked me  that today?  Well,  I mean,  it's a...  Honestly,  no.  No. 
[03:20:30]  You don't...  No,  I mean,  not even like a Seacrest.  No,  no,  no,  listen,  Seacrest,  I'm not going to put him,  Seacrest's a very talented  young man.  Sure.  Good looking,  very talented.  But is he Dick Clark?  No.  No.  Is cousin Brucey Dick Clark?  No.  Right?  Yeah,  but you're probably closer  than Ryan Seacrest.  Well,  I'm the heir apparent  to the oldest teenager now.  Yeah.  You're the guy.  That scares me.  I don't want to be  the oldest teenager.  That scares me.  There's only one way to go.  You know what I mean?  That's why when someone  says,  oh,  you're a legend,  you always get very nervous.  Uh-oh.  So,  will there ever be 
[03:21:00]  another Dick Clark?  No.  Right.  Will there be another  great phenomenon  that'll reach people  like he reached them  on television or radio?  Absolutely.  Something will come along.  It always is.  But Dick Clark is unique.  Mm-hmm.  Is unique.  And what is that  I didn't say was?  Is unique.  Is.  The legacy is alive.  Would you support,  did you see  that they did  the hologram for Tupac?  You know Tupac,  the rapper.  Yes.  He passed on  several years ago.  And on stage  at this concert,  they actually,  they really did this.  They put a 3D hologram out. 
[03:21:30]  And now they're talking  about going on tour  with the hologram  because it looked  completely realistic  and people were  obsessed with it.  Do you think that that,  would you like to see  something like that  happen with Dick Clark  or would you rather  people just let it go  and let the legacy  live for what the legacy is?  Now I'm not going to  surprise you by my answer.  I hope that never happens.  You wouldn't want to see it.  No, I want Dick Clark  to live in my heart.  Right.  I want my intellect  to remember Dick Clark.  I want my heart  especially to remember Dick Clark.  I don't want to see  a stuffed rabbit  or a stuffed bunny  of Dick Clark.  Mm-hmm.  That would hurt me 
[03:22:00]  very badly.  You want to see him  as you knew him.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's why  even when I watched him  on New Year's Eve,  and I think you  would probably agree  with me,  I was pulling for him  and I tried to visualize  Dick Clark the way he,  the way I grew up  with the young,  strapping guy.  Was that difficult  for you for the last  few years watching him?  Very sad.  Do you think  he should have stopped?  If it was anybody else  but Dick Clark, yes.  Uh-huh.  But knowing Dick Clark,  there's no way  you could stop him.  Right.  He was like unsinkable.  He could not be stopped.  Therefore, you know,  the idea of Dick Clark  leaving us, 
[03:22:30]  he was immortal.  That couldn't have happened.  Right.  So when I heard  that he passed on,  I said,  there can't be.  Because if one person,  even how sick he was,  and I knew how sick he was,  just went into a procedure  the other day,  I knew that this guy  was, you know,  in trouble.  He was getting older  and his body  was getting tired.  But the thought  of him leaving,  no.  I thought it would happen  many years from now,  naturally, right?  And one day we'd read  about it and we'd get ready  for it.  But not this suddenly,  not Dick Clark.  How often were you  still talking to him,  Cousin Brucey?  I haven't talked to him  in several years. 
[03:23:00]  Oh.  Before that,  well, after he got sick  and, you know,  he had to concentrate  on what he was doing.  He ran businesses.  You guys are busy guys.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm doing my thing  and he's doing,  but let me tell you something.  Anytime we saw each other,  it was always hugging  and it was great respect,  a mutual respect for each other,  which I'll always have for him.  Do you like doing this,  going around now,  being the guy  to kind of talk about him  or would you rather be  experiencing this  a little bit more privately?  Yes and no.  Yeah.  If one part of me says,  well, I can help enhance 
[03:23:30]  this great legacy that he left,  that's important.  The other part of me,  no, I'd rather be  sort of in the background  watching this and mourning  the way, you know,  you are allowed to mourn.  People are allowed to mourn.  Although I keep him  very alive in my heart.  And is that what motivated you  to do your show last night?  Because I would imagine  it'd be difficult for you,  you know,  you lost your friend  who's this great,  not only also an influence  on everything you've done,  to go and do a show,  but at the same time...  It hurt.  It hurt. 
[03:24:00]  But you get to celebrate  his life with the people.  Yeah, I celebrate his life  but I also realize  that when you lose somebody,  you, me, we all...  This is part of our contract,  the human,  the living contract.  When you experience this in life,  you want somebody  to hold your hand.  You want to talk to somebody  to make you feel a little better,  to discuss memories  and what you remember  and how you feel about it.  So I knew that this was something  that I had to do  to complete this cycle  with Dick Clark.  I had to do that show.  It hurt.  It hurt.  And I had to really 
[03:24:30]  take a lot of deep breaths  because I got very sad  talking to Tony Orlando,  talking to my audience,  the love,  the love that they displayed  for this man.  So I had to take many deep breaths.  And this was a sudden thing yesterday.  I mean...  So sudden.  Listen.  People were running around the halls  like,  what just happened?  I didn't know what was going on.  I came in by the subway.  I'm a subway.  I'm a strap hanger.  Still.  Oh, yeah.  I want to be with the people.  Yeah.  I like to be with the peeps  in the hood.  You get recognized on the subway?  Yeah.  And I talk to people.  You know,  that's how I discover 
[03:25:00]  what I want to do  and what I want to say  and what I want to play.  People talk to me  everywhere I go.  And it's nice.  That's how you stay in touch.  Yeah, exactly.  I understand.  So I came in  and then I get out  out of the subway.  My telephone,  my cell phone is burning.  You know,  it's vibrating  and it's jumping  out of my pants pocket.  Yeah.  And I'm going,  wow,  what's going on?  So right away,  I said,  oh my God,  something happened at home.  And right away,  you think.  Of course.  Family.  Then I'm saying,  well,  no,  everything,  it's going to be all right.  Something happened nationally.  So I get up here  and this place was like mayhem.  I was here, 
[03:25:30]  that was right when I was leaving.  I think we almost crossed paths.  Yeah.  I said,  you got to come with me,  you got to come with me.  Steve Leeds came over to me  and Kit Kelly  and all of our executives,  Scott Greenstein  and Steve Blatter.  They were all grabbing me  and I'm going,  one's grabbing me left,  one's grabbing me right.  I said,  all right,  come on,  let's see what's happening.  Calm down.  And then I finally got  your friend Dick Clark  passed away.  Now,  I really didn't know  what to do with that time.  I got very upset.  You know,  there are certain people in life  when they pass away,  you know where you were  and you never forgot. 
[03:26:00]  Like John Lennon and Elvis.  These are people  who are very close to my heart  and to this day,  I still feel and mourn.  Right?  I still feel that ache  of losing somebody.  Dick Clark,  I couldn't believe it  because I don't expect him  to leave us.  And you feel that strongly  about Dick Clark,  somebody who brought the music  as much as you do the musicians.  Yes.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  So they asked me to go on early.  Well,  I said,  all right,  I'll do a little bit.  I didn't know how much  I was going to do  because I wasn't prepared.  Of course.  Five hours later,  I'm still on the air 
[03:26:30]  doing a show,  talking to people.  That was the whole thing,  talking to the artists,  talking to the people,  playing,  of course,  the music that Dick  was so involved with.  And then when did you realize  that today  you'd be on a media tour?  But I got off the air last night  at about a little nine o'clock  that said,  Percy,  we're picking you up  at six o'clock in the morning.  Yeah,  so go get some sleep  because you've got a lot  of people to talk to.  I'm going on now  in overdrive  and I've been doing  television and radio.  But you know,  as I said,  it's sort of a,  I'm happy  and I'm very unhappy.  It's not a chore  I really like. 
[03:27:00]  And you probably,  based on what you've told me,  haven't really gotten  the chance to sit down  with it by yourself.  I haven't figured out  what happened yet.  Yeah.  I want to know.  I want to know  how the family is.  I want to know  about mutual friends  that we had.  Yeah.  And the business friends  and the art friends.  No,  I haven't had a chance  to really digest this yet.  Yeah.  Well,  where can people see you next?  On my pillow.  On your,  so you're getting out of here.  Well,  no,  I'm not getting out yet.  We got more to do.  Oh my God.  And I just said  that we're going to be here  for several hours  and then probably tomorrow too. 
[03:27:30]  But I'm going to make  a very big appearance  in my pillow  as soon as I can.  I just want to be able  to be alone  and think about this  a little bit.  I'm not a happy camper  right now.  Of course not.  You know,  Cousin Bruce,  you know,  I'm very optimistic.  I'm very positive,  which I am right now,  as you can hear.  Very energetic,  as he was.  When he and I got together,  it was sort of like a,  it was a love fest  with the music  and the energy would flow  from our microphones  or if we sat at a table  and broke bread. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  The energy was there.  I haven't had a chance  to accept this  or figure it out  yet digested.  It's interesting too.  I mean,  the way you're talking,  obviously,  there's a certain  professionalism  in broadcasting  that Dick Clark had it  and you have it.  Do you think  that still exists today?  Oh, absolutely.  You think so?  Yeah,  it has to come out.  We have to give,  got to give people a chance.  I think young people today,  broadcasters,  I've talked to dozens of them  just this morning  in all the different markets  talking about Dick Clark.  And I've got to tell you, 
[03:28:30]  very bright,  there's a lot of good talent  out there  and they just have to have  the platform,  the venue  to let this come out.  Now,  I've been given a venue  as you have.  It's called Sirius Satellite Radio,  Sirius XM.  I mean,  look what we have here.  Paul,  for the first time in my life,  I have complete freedom to fly.  I do what I want.  This was the first time  that you've been able to,  wow,  after all the years.  Look,  they always had respect  for me,  broadcasters.  They let me alone.  I had more freedom  than almost anybody on the air.  But we were still  harnessed into a chorale. 
[03:29:00]  I played 240 records  and we were allowed  to do this  and not really allowed  to be negative  or say what you want to say  from your heart.  If something happened politically,  I couldn't talk about it.  But you do now?  Oh, yeah.  Oh,  whatever I want.  Whatever I want.  As a matter of fact,  they encourage that.  Mel,  Scott,  and Steve,  they say,  Brucey,  be you.  And I say,  you know what that means?  He said,  yes,  be you.  And you know,  the same with you.  We've gone into  a very sophisticated time  of our lives  with this audience. 
[03:29:30]  They now have  this amazing service,  this satellite radio.  We're reaching nooks  and quantities  that I've never had  service before  that maybe never heard me  or you  or people have found you  or me  that haven't heard me  in 20 years.  You know,  I'll tell you a funny thing.  When I went back  to the area,  I've been on seven years  down here.  And the first time  I went on,  some guy gets on  and says,  oh my God,  you're still alive?  You know,  out in South Dakota.  So here we're  reaching people  and we're sharing intellect,  we're sharing ideas again  and I love it very much.  And you still, 
[03:30:00]  after all this time,  it still gets you  impassioned  when you find out  there's new people listening.  Absolutely.  That's incredible.  I hug them.  That light goes on  as there's bruising  around the air.  I get that same feeling  in my belly  as I did many years ago.  Well,  they're letting me know  in my headphones  that you've got to go  do some more phoners  for Felicity  and you've got a lot  of stuff to do.  So we're going to let you go.  In the meantime,  we were talking about  Bandstand obviously today  and Barry Manilow  sang the song.  And Ron Dante  produced this one,  by the way.  He did.  It was a great,  we had him on last night, 
[03:30:30]  great performer  and a great producer.  We wanted to,  we actually,  Eric,  if you're ready,  we wanted to play  the Tippy Tom  and Barry Manilow story  as it relates to us.  You got that?  One second,  hang on.  Okay,  Eric's going to get that ready.  Brucey,  appreciate you stopping by  and making time.  Hey,  are you kidding?  It's always my pleasure.  You're a busy guy today.  You look terrific.  No,  you look terrific,  Brucey.  We both look all right.  We look great,  don't we?  Well,  good luck with everything.  Thank you so much.  All right,  and we're sending this.  This is the Tippy Tom  and Barry Manilow story  on After Open Anthony Live. 
[03:31:00]  After O&E Live.  What about Barry Manilow?  Now,  you lived with Barry Manilow?  Briefly.  Briefly?  What do you mean by that?  This one's for you  wherever you are.  What do you mean briefly there,  Tippy?  What happened?  Let us know about  the relationship there.  Well,  the relationship was this.  I met him in a bar  and I didn't know who.  The Copacabana?  No,  downtown in the village. 
[03:31:30]  Copacabana.  There he is.  The hottest spot.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no, </pre>
