<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, focusing on the hosts' experiences with power outages (Opie's lasted 11 days) and gas shortages on Long Island.  They launched into vulgar and offensive tangents while criticizing the government's response, particularly Mayor Bloomberg's handling of the situation, including his marathon decision and food donation ban. A caller, Robert, had a heated exchange with the hosts regarding Time Warner Cable credits.  Musical interludes included a Mr. Rogers remix and a Black Sabbath/Led Zeppelin mashup.  Upcoming guests Brian Regan, Sir Roger Moore, and Chip Chipperson were mentioned.

The show then featured a lengthy "FU Line" segment followed by Rich Vos and Bonnie McFarlane's in-studio appearance to promote their movie, "Women Aren't Funny."  They discussed the film's production, its many comedic guest stars (Chris Rock, Dane Cook, Joan Rivers, Sarah Silverman, Artie Lange, Wanda Sykes, Lisa Lampanelli, Patrice O'Neal, Colin Quinn, and Jimmy Carr), and the editing process.  The conversation veered into humorous anecdotes about their relationship, McFarlane's unconventional upbringing in rural Canada (including killing chickens and lack of running water), and her family's reaction to her comedy career.  McFarlane shared a story about a solo bus trip to the hospital as a child.  They also discussed a family reunion and talent show.  Further discussion included the merits (or lack thereof) of turkey bacon.

Bonnie McFarlane remained a main guest, joined by Rich Vos and later Brian Regan.  McFarlane discussed her family's lack of humor and her sister who has Down syndrome, sharing darkly humorous anecdotes.  The conversation included tangents on Canadian culture (Vos mistakenly making Asian jokes to Indigenous Canadians), a heated exchange about a podcast discussing McFarlane's sister, and Regan's recent divorce.  A bizarre discussion about stolen golf items from Regan's bag occurred, along with a detailed, humorous, and rambling discussion about Regan's upcoming CBS Sunday Morning appearance.  A segment on weight loss and unusual food combinations led to a plan to taste-test seaweed snacks and Entenmann's donuts.  Chip Chipperson appeared for an interview about a UFC event.  The show continued with further discussion of Regan's CBS appearance.  The hosts frequently used offensive language.


The next segment began with a discussion of Regan's CBS Sunday Morning appearance and a dislike of morning shows, utilizing strong language to describe their feelings about a Folgers commercial.  The conversation shifted to Charles Carral and the stresses of maintaining multiple relationships. They reminisced about a night out with Regan involving heavy drinking before Regan joined the show to discuss his upcoming performances and his appearance on Jerry Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee."  They briefly touched upon the recent election.  After Regan left, Sir Roger Moore entered.  The interview with Moore covered his Bond career, comparing his portrayal to others, his experiences filming (including near-death experiences), his feelings about the franchise, and receiving his knighthood. He also discussed his post-Bond career, UNICEF work, and friendships with other celebrities.  The interview was interspersed with the hosts' interjections and jokes. The segment concluded with a brief discussion of upcoming events, a conflict between Bonnie and Joe DeRosa, and promotional material for Steven Singer Jewelers.

A segment focused on Bonnie McFarlane's contentious experience filming a short with Joe DeRosa, stemming from a pizza topping disagreement and escalating into a larger argument about her performance and behavior.  DeRosa's subsequent angry tirade, later emailed to McFarlane, was discussed.  McFarlane's friend Nick from Australia was present.  DeRosa later called, leaving a conciliatory voicemail deemed insincere by McFarlane.  DeRosa joined the show via phone, largely mirroring McFarlane's account but emphasizing the pepper spill on a Warner Brothers chair.  They debated their actions and perspectives, acknowledging fault but disagreeing on severity.  The discussion involved DeRosa's intensity as a director and how their working relationship affected their friendship.  DeRosa confirmed future projects with McFarlane, though strained feelings remained.  The conversation involved several tangents, including discussions about other projects and various unrelated comedic anecdotes.


The final segment centered on the fallout from Joe DeRosa's perceived rudeness and unprofessional behavior, including his no-show for a scheduled segment despite expecting preferential treatment. The hosts discussed DeRosa's lack of courtesy, contrasting him with guests like Ricky Gervais and Louis C.K.  They also discussed past interactions with other show personalities, including "fights" with Troy and Bonnie.  Whether DeRosa was banned from the show was debated.  Opie, Anthony, Nick, and Kelly discussed Kelly's upcoming hosting gigs at The Stand, Roland's birthday, and a possible conflict between Roland and Voss over Bond memorabilia.  Jay Moore's positive comments were mentioned.  The segment ended with DeRosa's ban being reiterated and promotion of Nick and Kelly's upcoming appearances, concluding the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6am, and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fledgling.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten egg from Sue.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground.  Would you like to make a fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  That doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning!  Morning! 
[00:02:00]  Yeah!  Morning!  Yeah, this is great.  I've been waiting for about 14 hours to do this.  Hold on, give me one second.  Please, please, please, give me one second.  Mm-hmm.  Cake and pie and chocolate and sweets.  That is what E-Rock likes to eat.  All for himself, he ain't sharing a bit.  That's why he has tits.  He's a fat piece of shit.  Ah, no reason. 
[00:02:30]  It's been stuck in my head like everyone else's head.  Yeah, there's a constant rotation of four songs that are in my head.  That's one of them.  Yeah, that's Zeps.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Jingle slash sound contest.  He's right up there, one of the leaders.  I had Gangnam Style stuck in my head, but not the whole song.  Gangnam Style!  Just that part.  Open Gangnam Style!  Just that.  Yeah.  Just that.  Open Gangnam Style!  Oh, my God.  Open Gangnam Style!  And that's a short loop.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got Mr. Rogers stuck in my head. 
[00:03:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Is that what you're watching around the house?  No.  Or old school?  No, no, no.  I did watch the Jetsons and the Flintstones recently, though.  Fucking Barney.  Why would Barney be...  Ah, whatever.  I'm not going to do this stupid hack bit.  I just realized.  What?  Fred's just a dick.  Why would Barney hang out with him?  He's a dick.  No, I was watching the YouTube, and someone sent me a Mr. Rogers remix.  Ah, the old remix.  And then I tweeted, and then some asshole had to say, 
[00:03:30]  You didn't realize that was on Reddit in February?  Right.  Well, it's new to me, idiot.  Sorry.  It is just astounding.  The internet is just a place to fucking just go and get angry.  But why is everyone on edge?  Yeah.  I tweet this like, wow, this is cool.  This is new in my world.  And actually, in general, people were like, you know, into it.  But what an idiot.  There's always an idiot.  The Reddit month, February. 
[00:04:00]  If you're a fan of what I'm doing,  then maybe you should have fucking tweeted me this damn thing in February,  if you saw it on Reddit.  I don't know what to tell you.  Some things are going to slip through the cracks of your viewing.  Of course.  You know, there are certain things.  Because they want to consider themselves like,  I'm on top of everything.  You a fucking nut.  All right.  Then send me some of this shit.  Douchebags.  Don't send me anything.  It's all worthless shit.  God.  Hey, you've got to see this.  Check this out. 
[00:04:30]  Funny shit for your show.  No, it's not.  Nine out of ten, it isn't?  Oh, God.  It's usually drivel.  Well, the Mr. Rogers remix we'll do into break.  It's a nice little thing into break.  It sounds like a real fucking song.  Well.  It's kind of creepy.  Fucking utopia now.  Jesus.  Hey, man.  At least we're on the Gangnam Style thing, man.  See?  Not everything falls through the cracks in this show.  Open Gangnam Style.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Wow.  Open Gangnam Style.  Open Gangnam Style.  I cannot fucking get up for a party at this hour.  Why?  What's wrong?  Let's play this a little more.  I woke up late.  What?  I woke up last night.  It's the middle of the night.  And I wake up.  And I can't get back to sleep.  Because I fell asleep at like fucking 7.30 at night.  You went to bed at 7.30?  Bed.  I miss my bed so bad. 
[00:05:30]  Just go up there.  Although I miss my bed.  You still out?  No.  It's freezing cold.  And I don't fucking have TV up there.  The only place there's heat and television is in my fucking downstairs.  So Tuesday, Wednesday, you're 11 days in.  No power.  It's 11 fucking days in.  Got a generator.  So you got some things working.  Got that going.  Which is nice.  I got that going for me.  Which is nice.  Yeah.  I was talking to my sister yesterday who lives relatively close to you.  A couple towns over.  And she's decided to be the, I'm going to collect all these supplies for Coney Island. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yeah?  She's going to drive to Coney Island like a fucking truckload of shit to help the people.  Man.  She went on Facebook and like, hey, let's do this.  That's pretty decent.  It is pretty decent.  I'm like, are you related to me?  No, it's kind of cool, actually.  But she was telling me about the snow.  How much snow in your yard?  Eight to nine inches?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's saying that now the problem is they can't plow the roads or yesterday.  Yeah.  Because there's so much shit in the roads. 
[00:06:30]  Like the plows don't know where to fucking go.  They can't drive a plow through the roads with the old furniture that's put out from destroyed houses.  Trees that are down.  Wires that are tangled in those downed trees.  Because you've got to zig and zag your way out of these roads.  So she's like, they're not really plowing the side streets because they don't really know where to fucking plow.  Because everything is hidden right now under snow.  No one knows.  No one knows anything, by the way.  Really?  Well, LIPA admitted a thing or two. 
[00:07:00]  Did they?  Yeah, big article in the paper today.  I've had it with LIPA.  Well, something we've been saying for, I don't know, at least a week now.  The government now saying antiquated utility failed.  That's LIPA.  They're calling it antiquated as well.  You know, we've been having the discussion, like, it's very expensive to get the power lines underground and all that.  But the government itself saying, look, there's things that they could have and should have done way before the super storm.  So they're calling them antiquated.  And then I guess LIPA admitted weeks before the storm that they were way behind as far as trimming the trees back. 
[00:07:30]  Yep.  And you know what that's about?  Oh, yeah.  That's about saving some funds.  Save some of that cash.  Why put them guys out there with overtime and cutting trees when they could just have them doing other things?  Yeah, that's a big part of LIPA and these power companies.  You get the tree trimming guys out there and make sure that you get the freaking big limbs off the lines just in case a storm like Sandy hits. 
[00:08:00]  So it's a huge article, man.  They're all pointing fingers at LIPA going, what the fuck?  And then I heard there's some controversial move they're making.  They wanted to, before they turn on the power on some of these areas, they want to check every single basement to make sure it's not flooded because they don't want to electrocute people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then they finally said, look, that's going to take too much time.  So we're going to just turn this shit on.  Just start turning it on.  So we're telling everyone, you've got to check your own basements.  It's up to the homeowner at this point.  Is that controversial or what? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, well, they do have something in place, I think, that you need a certified electrician to sign off on your house before they tie your house into the power supply.  There are some people with powers on the pole right there near their house, but they're not allowed to get it because they need certification that their box isn't full of salt water and corroded wires and whatnot.  And there's not enough certified electricians around to do this.  Right.  And some of the people do need the boxes replaced because they've been destroyed by the water. 
[00:09:00]  It's just shit that you look at and think about and go, this is going to take forever.  So they realized it was going to take forever.  So now they're saying, look, we've got to turn this shit on.  Let's turn this shit on.  So there's going to be some shit going down.  Flip that fucking switch, you motherfuckers.  What do you think is going to happen?  I don't know.  There could be some fire.  I think someone's grandma is going to get electrocuted.  A little electrocution going on.  And then there's people that have tied their panels into their generators, but they haven't shut off the main breaker. 
[00:09:30]  So the power is going through their house, which is what it's supposed to do.  But it's also going out the way the power is supposed to come in.  Oh, I see.  Because if you leave your main open, that circuit's open.  And now the power is going out because you're feeding your panel.  And so workers are under the threat of being electrocuted.  Well, how do they make sure?  And when they turn the power on, now you're going to have power coming in and power going out.  So now power is going to feed into these generators.  It's just...  But how are the workers going to be safe? 
[00:10:00]  They got to ask for it.  Well, they got to test all the lines before they...  That's why they go around and they tap the fucking lines and shit with those poles, with the voltage meter poles, and see if they're live.  It's amazing.  Is that what they do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You see them, like, tap them around.  Wow!  I didn't know that.  These poles, yeah.  I'm like, how do they know?  Wow!  Even these idiots aren't going to just grab fucking live wires.  So if it's not live, nothing happens?  What if it's live?  Then they got to figure out where it's coming from.  How do they know it's live, though?  So it'll show up on a meter. 
[00:10:30]  That shows that there's electricity.  That there's electricity going through.  Wow!  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It's insane.  It's just insane.  And I've been leaning toward getting a house in the suburbs.  I think I might wait.  I might wait a little longer.  Well, I'm...  Fuck that shit.  I'm in Jersey, not Long Island, man.  Long Island's terrible with the power.  Well, it's terrible.  Long Island's crazy.  It's the commute that kills me going back and forth to Long Island.  Yeah.  I'm in full generator construction mode now. 
[00:11:00]  Full generator going in mode.  This is no more bullshitting around.  This fucking giant generator that powers my whole house for a long fucking time is absolutely going in.  The big giant tank?  The big giant tank.  Is going in?  Everything.  I've had it with Lipa and their fucking power failures every time the wind blows.  It's insane.  11 days in.  Dude, I'm fucking just...  Are you cold?  No, no.  I have heat.  Oh, you did say that.  I have heat. 
[00:11:30]  And hot water.  So why don't you go upstairs?  I don't have heat upstairs.  What I have heat with is...  Can't you get wired so you got some heat upstairs?  I can, but I don't want to be fucking...  God, air handlers and stuff.  Fucking forced hot air blowers and shit.  I have the radiant heat on my floors downstairs.  Right.  So it heats that up.  And it's not so much the heat, because the heat does go upstairs.  It's not cold, cold upstairs.  But I want, you know, I need TV.  I can't just sit there in the dark like a fucking mental patient.  Why aren't you making videos? 
[00:12:00]  I don't know.  I can't.  A video of how you're living would do really well.  People would really...  It's just too crazy.  They really want to see that.  It's crazy.  You're just sleeping on a couch?  My treks outside to top off the fucking generator.  Right.  My fucking...  My just walking around and then looking outside.  Just turning my head, looking at all the downed wires.  Why haven't you put your helicopter in the air?  It's been too windy.  It's been too fucking windy.  I've tried to take it up a couple of times.  And it's like...  It starts like blowing around. 
[00:12:30]  I'm like, I can't risk this.  Yeah, it's not a shitty one anymore.  You've really invested a lot of money into that drone.  And it's not even like...  If it was even a pretty good wind, I could get away with.  But it's just gusting too much to really get good control of this thing in the air.  Did you guys get eight inches of snow?  It was at least eight inches of snow.  There's not even a hint that it snowed in Manhattan.  Nothing.  It was on the ground when we came in yesterday morning.  And man, they just...  They love snow removal.  Yeah, they can just get rid of it.  In Manhattan.  Yeah.  And the temperature's always a little higher and the streets are a little warmer and things like that. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, the ground's not that cold for it to stay around too long.  It's fucking crazy.  Isn't it going to be like 60 today?  Yeah.  So all the snow's going to melt.  I think 60 tomorrow or something.  It's supposed to be in the 50s though too.  Yeah.  My whole life revolves around gasoline.  It's gasoline.  And this.  You're hoping it doesn't do what? 
[00:13:30]  No.  As long as you hear, you're good.  You're good, right?  And it's constant.  Yeah.  It's just this constant drone.  What I've done, I've taken the...  You know those foam pool floats that you lay on in the pool?  Sure.  I've surrounded my generator with that.  Like, just built a circle around it with that to kind of absorb the sound.  And my window that I run the extension cords through, I've put, because it's got to be open like a crack to get the extension cords through, I've just put all my outdoor furniture pillows and shoved it in the windows to kind of absorb the sound. 
[00:14:00]  It works pretty well.  But it's...  And what are your neighbors doing?  They got generators?  I open up the door and I hear...  Oh, really?  My whole neighborhood is annoying.  Annoying and noisy.  Everyone's running a fucking generator now.  Sounds like it could be a nice little song, a little tune. 
[00:14:30]  No, it's not a good tune.  It's the fucking annoying, there's no electricity tune.  I don't even know how I would handle 11 days without power.  That's terrible.  With two little kids, especially.  Oh, thank God, I'm just alone.  To answer the equation.  God, I'm alone.  Thank God.  And then Ange came over yesterday, because she just needs to get the fuck out of her house, because she was in one of those areas that were devastated.  Are they living in that house?  No, they're living with Keith's parents in, like, Keith's parents' house's basement. 
[00:15:00]  Because Keith's parents' house, like, their house is destroyed.  Like, fucking destroyed.  So they own another house that they rent.  The one on the canal?  Yeah.  That's gone?  Gone!  Fucking destroyed.  What do you mean destroyed?  FEMA's, like, not even...  They're considering whether they should even, like, rebuild it or just fucking...  Was it knocked down at all, or just so much water damage?  I assume so much water damage, and pieces of it just taken off and thrown away.  Ange came over yesterday and showed me pictures of her house. 
[00:15:30]  And they're apparently way ahead of the game.  Um, they've cut all the walls down halfway, and, uh, they're drying the wood out and thrown every possession they own away.  Just fucking thrown away.  Even the stuff upstairs?  Oh, upstairs is the kids' room.  So they have that, but it's, like, their possessions.  The important stuff, you know?  Right.  I mean, that shit's just gone.  Wow.  I saw pictures of the water line on their fences and on their house.  There's shit in their house that wasn't even in some of the rooms when they left. 
[00:16:00]  It just picked up, floated in their house and, uh...  How much water in the house?  Like, four feet of water.  Wow.  And, uh, yeah, so they had to cut, like, above the four-foot line around their house.  So, yeah, Ange was over yesterday just like, ugh, it's...  And she's talking about things that are happening in her neighborhood.  Like, no one could really help each other.  And I think someone asked Keith, you know,  do you think I could have a couple gallons of gas for my generator?  And Keith, I go, no.  Like, that means I don't have the gas. 
[00:16:30]  Like, you can't even help your neighbors out.  It's gotten to that point.  And then there was another, I guess, um...  Ange was talking about somebody that was having some coffee place or whatever.  I don't remember exactly where it was.  But this woman was with her kids, and her house was devastated.  And someone asked, how are you doing?  And she's just like a total stranger and just breaks down crying.  And her kids are crying and stuff.  And she's like, yeah, everything is...  And then the guy just goes like, well, we're taking contributions for people in the neighborhood. 
[00:17:00]  Could you give?  Give him.  And she was so flustered, she actually pulled $5 out of the pocket and gave it to him.  And then as she's walking out, she just goes in hysterics again, realizing what she did.  Right.  Like, why would this asshole even ask?  Like, that's the fucking mindset of people out there.  They're dumb.  God, we really need the Middle East, huh?  You realize...  Oh, my God.  We need Alaska.  How dependent we are on that fucking fuel right now.  If that fuel gets cut off...  Oh, my God.  This is New York.  I'll say it again.  You understand now why we put up with their bullshit in the Middle East. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know why...  We have no choice.  It's amazing.  Because this is a little taste of how it would be.  Yeah.  I don't know why Bloomberg and the powers that be on Long Island haven't gone with the gas  odd even earlier than this.  They really fucking dropped the ball.  Because he stinks.  He does stink.  We have had these gas lines for 11 days now.  And he finally went with the odd even.  They don't look like they're calming down.  So we finally now, 11 days later, and after Jersey made an example and showed that it actually 
[00:18:00]  does work, he decided that now is the time to do it.  I mean, by now we should be getting fucking gas.  Iraq, sir?  On Route 3, there's a whole bunch of gas stations when you come out of the Lincoln Tunnel.  And there were no lines yesterday.  You could get into the stations and pump gas lines.  Odd even, it works.  It cuts half the fucking cars, at least, off the fucking line on a daily basis.  Most of these people that are gassing up have enough gas for that next day. 
[00:18:30]  They just want to top their tanks off.  That's what's making these giant lines.  So if you odd even it, you're cutting half the traffic down.  Why did it take so fucking long for New York and Long Island to do this, knowing that  it was working in Jersey, and these fucking lines have been the bane of people's existence  in this state?  He's terrible with anything that has to do with driving or getting around.  He doesn't understand it.  He doesn't understand it.  He doesn't understand the average person.  He does not understand how they lift their lives.  Driving, getting gas, going to work.  Even though he's a self-made guy. 
[00:19:00]  Unbelievable.  Well, you know what he was into yesterday, right?  Probably a man's heinie.  He's banning donations to the homeless.  Yes, we heard about that, too.  Where is it again?  Banning donations.  Do not deliver food to the homeless.  Haven't we talked about this in the past?  I feel like we've done this before.  Because we've made the jokes, which are not even jokes.  It's real.  Well, you see the homeless digging in garbage fucking cans every day.  Right.  And eating half-eaten burgers. 
[00:19:30]  And sometimes the one that really gets me, like a homeless guy grabbing a half-eaten burger  out of the trash doesn't bother me as much as when they find someone's half-eaten Chinese  food, and they'll dig in.  That's a coup right there.  But they'll dig in.  For some reason, that's the one that gets me.  Homeless for?  So we know that homeless does.  They do this.  They'll eat anything out of the garbage.  And this idiot is banning giving food to the homeless because they can't monitor the  salt or trans fat content.  The sodium or trans fat. 
[00:20:00]  These motherfuckers are starving.  They don't give a shit.  Was that because there was lawsuits, though?  Like a few bums filed lawsuits because the food that they got made them sick or whatever.  So to save the city from lawsuits, they stopped it.  Is that why they stopped it?  I heard it had something to do with lawsuits.  Maybe I should say lawsuits again.  You can't defend yourself against bums, though?  No, but it's just the cost of rising litigation.  You have those guys killed.  Yeah, it would be okay.  The guy's lawyer comes in with one of those sticks with a bag tied to it. 
[00:20:30]  Well, let me get my brief.  Like an old school hobo with that hat.  Well, your honor.  Yeah.  You're going to allow the homeless to influence your policy?  Yeah.  You fucking take those guys out.  Yeah, my Esquire, Dewey, stink him in hell.  I don't know what happened to him.  You know, he got hit by another homeless guy with a brick.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's a shame because he was fucking suing the city.  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  That's just amazing to me. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  He's not good in a crisis situation, either.  No, and he wanted to be Giuliani, too.  So badly.  The way this is just going on and on with really no recourse, no solution, no real light at the end of the tunnel.  I mean, when Katrina happened, and it started getting out that people weren't being taken care of, and I don't mean coddled to taking care of, I mean the basics that the government is supposed to do. 
[00:21:30]  Because a lot of people get on me about this and are like, there's no government, dude.  See what happens when you don't.  No, the government is there to do certain jobs.  That's why you pay your taxes.  They're not there to coddle the healthy and working fucking people that could actually work and do things.  That I don't agree with.  When there's a disaster, that's when your tax dollars are supposed to swing into play and fucking clean up the mess and keep the fucking motor running.  It's been awful on Staten Island, Jersey, and Long Island, and these motherfuckers aren't mentioning it. 
[00:22:00]  No one's bringing it into the public eye.  No celebrity fucking bullshit.  It's just, it's happening.  It's terrible.  And no one's fucking doing anything about it.  This one was really bad.  Really bad.  I don't know if the rest of the country fully understands yet, but really bad.  And you need a leader.  You need someone like Bloomberg going, look, this was a motherfucker of a storm.  But that's when leaders lead.  Get it and start racking some fucking head.  Like he does these. 
[00:22:30]  Not giving it.  He does these updates and these press conferences with that wacky signing lady, which I can't get enough of.  Right, enough of her.  She's so dramatic with her signing.  But he's like a robot.  He does blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Like he doesn't have that, you know, Reagan would talk to the people.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  You need a communicator.  Slip the surly bonds of earth and touch the face of God.  Right.  Well.  You need a communicator in times like this. 
[00:23:00]  Someone that could really just get on TV and go, look, this is a motherfucker, but we're going to get through this.  Here's a problem.  And this is what we're doing.  No, and he wanted to be.  He's Julie Andrews.  How long have you been sitting on a car?  Five minutes.  That's a good one.  Because that's too good.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Well, he blew it with the marathon.  We all know it.  Yeah.  To think that the marathon should have, you know, went on anyway is ridiculous.  That's all you need to know.  That's an indicator.  That's an indicator of what type of person he is.  The total lack of any connection with the people. 
[00:23:30]  He's a fucking idiot when it comes to that shit.  He's a rich fucking elitist twat.  He really is.  And I think he means well.  And I think he thinks he's doing the right thing.  But he literally cares more about potted plants in the city.  And I wanted to look festive like San Francisco in a bike lane.  Of course.  Yes.  He doesn't have a clue how the average person lives.  No, he doesn't.  Not even a clue.  That's his problem.  You know how we beat up companies because they never give you a break?  And it's very rare when one does. 
[00:24:00]  No.  Time Warner.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Gets the big thumbs up today.  Well, I think Cablevision is doing it and Verizon.  Why?  I just, I'm just not used to this.  I'm surprised Time Warner is doing it.  Basically, Time Warner, when you don't have cable, as a customer, you have to call them  and go, look, I didn't have fucking cable for two or three days because of this ice storm  or whatever, right?  They're just, they're not, you don't have to call them.  They're just going to credit everybody.  That's fair.  That's great because we beat up all these companies because it never works out in your  favor.  This one is doing the right thing. 
[00:24:30]  Time Warner.  Normally, you have to call to request credit for the days you didn't have service, but  now credits will appear automatically on cable bills, the company said yesterday.  That's huge.  That's a company doing the right thing, finally.  Doing the right thing.  Because it never works in your favor.  Or most of the time it doesn't, right?  No, it usually doesn't.  I want to say the fucking homeless food.  Like, uh, there's something else in there that'll pop into my mind, I guess. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  My stupid brain.  Uh, my neighborhood's still, like, like, it's, everything is still there.  That, that's what gets me.  If I saw one thing that was progress being made, I'd be like, well, okay, at least something.  Every single scrap of wood that fell off a pole or trees, every single wire that was  down that was wrapped and tangled in those downed trees, still there, exactly like it  was, covered in snow now, by the way. 
[00:25:30]  What I don't understand is, uh, I, I had a long talk with my sister, like I said, a little  while ago, and she's only a couple towns over from you, and, you know, let's be honest,  she doesn't live in the nice neighborhood like you do.  Well.  And she said, I go, so what's the deal?  Because I haven't been able to get out there.  Mm-hmm.  Because, you know, I got a new fucking born and all that.  And she said all the trees are taken away in her neighborhood.  Really?  She said there were trees down everywhere, but now they've all been taken away.  Why is that?  Like, what do you think it is that makes this neighborhood slower? 
[00:26:00]  I have no idea.  That's what I'm wondering.  They, but did they have a lot of wires down in those trees?  That's the biggest issue.  They didn't lose power as long as you did.  What I heard was the big issue with the downed trees and the wires, it's the chicken and  egg thing here, you know?  The, the trees are down on the wires.  So, they can't put up the wires, but they can't take the trees away and start cutting  them because there's wires in them.  So, everybody's going, what the fuck do we do?  They need wire and tree crews there at the same time, which is impossible to get. 
[00:26:30]  And I think they're trying to get more populated areas up and running, right?  Well, yeah, they want the big numbers so they look good first, and that happens with  every storm.  That's against you a little bit, too.  Yeah.  11 days without power is fucking disgusting.  Especially when you pay the highest taxes in the country.  I can't even imagine that.  And then people are like, well, you know, you fucking utility company, that has nothing  to do with your taxes if the utility company doesn't get good.  Yeah, but there's a basic infrastructure that I do pay for with taxes, and that has failed 
[00:27:00]  also.  And that's what I'm talking about.  Not the fact that, you know, the power company isn't there on a pole, and I think  my taxes pay the power guy.  Like, no, I understand that.  And for what we do pay in power, they should fucking be fixing everybody and feeding them  fucking tea and crumpets as they do it.  Robert and Brooklyn at the same time.  One are only offering this in devastated areas.  Oh.  Robert.  There you go.  Hello there.  Hey, real fast.  Bobby. 
[00:27:30]  How are you guys?  I'm a long time listening.  Wah, wah.  Bah, bah.  How you guys doing, man?  Oh, good, good.  I would love to get up there, man.  I remember my friend owns Delphante's restaurant.  He bought you food.  The what restaurant?  The Delphante's restaurant.  Remember they bought food?  I think I did like them.  Was it good food?  I don't remember what they had.  Yeah, it was.  But start over with a little hello, bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-boy.  Oh, this guy's about an annoying fuck.  It doesn't have any patience. 
[00:28:00]  I have no patience, sir, for these fucking callers.  As a friend, I suggest you get to it.  Yeah.  Jesus.  This was supposed to be a quick phone call, in all fairness.  I'm sorry.  I had my headphones on, and I was like...  Give us a shit!  Fucking headphones on!  What are you doing, man?  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  He's doing every single one, I swear.  Look, man.  It's his only time he'll ever talk.  Who cares?  He's going to enjoy it.  Thank you, sir.  Get to the point, Robert. 
[00:28:30]  The point is, I've listened to you guys from the N.E.W. days where you...  Who gives a shit?  He's an old fan.  He's a long-time fan.  He goes way back, yeah?  He goes way back.  Way back.  Every fucking...  One of these fucking things.  He goes back to the time when you were married.  Let me tell you, I've been listening for...  Do you realize how much I could give a fuck how long you've been listening, Bobby?  Bobby!  You were almost married to that Spanish girl.  I was never married to the...  Spanish girl?  No! 
[00:29:00]  Yeah!  Now you're pissing me off!  Yeah, you are!  I was never close to marrying that fucking bitch.  Oh, I hope you were close, right?  Anthony was.  Ant knows.  Can't wait to get the fucking...  I'm not going to say their last name out of my life.  I said it years ago.  Well...  They're a bunch of whack jobs.  I went through...  That Spanish girl.  Go fuck your mother.  What happened, sir?  Why did you call?  What did you tell the screener?  Okay, I called because...  You didn't mention about... 
[00:29:30]  Bobo.  Time Warner.  But they're only giving credit to the devastation areas.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  They're not giving it to everybody.  He's been on three minutes, by the way.  And that's what he wanted to say.  No, but it's a good point, though.  It's my birthday.  Happy birthday.  Oh, God, no.  Have you really been listening since the beginning?  Shut it.  Since the NEW days?  Yeah.  Well, anyway, it was just my birthday on Halloween, so...  Aw, happy birthday.  Your birthday. 
[00:30:00]  Who fucking cares?  Dress up like a cake with a bunch of candles.  Bobby!  Babo!  I'm really sorry about your electricity.  I could give a fuck what you think.  Sorry.  I hate you.  I love you, man.  He loves you.  He loves you, man.  Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.  I love you guys, man.  You're the greatest.  But, but, but, boys.  Of course we are.  Thank you, sir.  I hope you enjoyed your time with us.  Off.  Bobby.  Bobby in Brooklyn.  Yeah, Bobby means well, but he takes a little while to get to it. 
[00:30:30]  Holy shit.  What a shatty douchebag.  He went through all of it.  Yeah, he likes to, he likes a big build-up to a conversation.  Yeah, yeah.  To a nothing.  You didn't think that was a good point?  Oh, what a fucking dullard.  When does the sun rise, by the way, nowadays?  Every time I see you.  Aw.  I see some sun coming down the hall there.  Oh, yeah.  It's getting a little blue out there.  Tomorrow is.  That daylight savings time is the dumbest thing ever. 
[00:31:00]  Especially when you have kids and you realize you're stuck in the house starting at 3.30  in the afternoon when you can be outside.  It's so dumb.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, I'm so tired.  What?  I'm up.  This is nice.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, it was so nice just being with you last night and sleeping together with you.  Hi, la-  I got no power! 
[00:31:30]  I'm on the couch!  Holy shit!  That sucks!  You're on edge, huh?  Oh, God!  Is it a guarantee you're not going to get power over the weekend?  I would guarantee I don't have power.  So Monday will be, now we're talking two weeks.  Yes.  Two straight weeks without power.  Kenny finally got it.  And my brother who's having Thanksgiving got fucking power.  Oh, Long Island.  I'm very happy.  Yeah.  What, are you going out there after Thanksgiving for Turkey? 
[00:32:00]  For Turkey?  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Where's that?  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Where you going for Thanksgiving?  That's right around the corner now, you know.  Poor, again, Keith and Ange, they're poor, they're kids.  And little G is like, you know, when are we going to have, where are we going to have  Thanksgiving?  And she's like, well, probably, you know, over Uncle Anthony's house.  And I'm sitting here thinking like, you know, I'd love to. 
[00:32:30]  Obviously, they come over to my house, regardless if I have power or not, they come over to my house for Thanksgiving.  But it's like, I have to wonder if by Thanksgiving I'm going to have power?  I wasn't even near the ocean, by the way.  I wasn't near any.  I'm equally as far from the ocean on the sound of the North Shore as I am from the ocean on the South Shore.  I'm in high ground.  You're in the middle.  I didn't have an inkling of any flooding or nothing.  And I still have no power because of nothing but wind. 
[00:33:00]  Nothing but wind.  It's just amazing to me that it's taking this long.  The other thing.  It popped in my stupid brain.  So what is the deal with the gas?  I thought we were on our way.  I thought so, too.  So what's the deal?  What's the holdup?  Does anyone know?  What's the deal with this gas?  Well, didn't Cuomo say, look, help and relief is on the way.  It's going to take a couple more days.  He did.  A couple more days has passed by now.  A couple of days has long passed.  11 days and still having no gas. 
[00:33:30]  Anything can be trucked in this country in a matter of a couple of days.  I don't know.  What's the problem?  Does anyone know?  No one knows.  No one's saying.  There should be a fucking investigation about this shit.  Wow.  Is it something they don't want to tell us?  It's craziness.  How is New York City, the pinnacle of the free world, without gasoline?  Why are there not, like you said the other day, why are there not just convoys of tanker trucks?  Of tankers.  Being escorted by fucking military and bringing it into an area that needs... 
[00:34:00]  Do you understand if we had some type of terrorist event on the heels of this, that people would  be fucked because they don't even have gas enough to get the fuck out of a way?  Did you understand it's a matter of national security to get the fucking gas flowing in  New York?  It's amazing.  And no one's answering to this?  So we don't know?  No.  Not a clue.  Wow.  That's a little strange.  Not a fucking clue.  That's really strange. 
[00:34:30]  Because Cuomo did say, look, relief's on the way.  It's going to take a couple more days for it to trickle down into the actual gas stations.  Trickle down to gas stations?  Well, I mean, they...  You've got to fucking...  You've got to go above and beyond the refineries and pipelines that were cut off at the beginning  of this storm.  You have to go beyond the...  Depending on fixing those and pumping in gas and get it from outside sources.  Like I was saying, convoys of tanker trucks being escorted by the National fucking Guard 
[00:35:00]  to get through and get these gas stations filled, keep them filled, and keep people with tanks  of gasoline.  It's a matter of national security.  But we don't know why.  Not a clue.  Does anyone know why?  Why this isn't happening?  Odd even on day 11?  Well, this guy, obviously, which is, to your point, even if the tankers are coming from  California, it takes two days.  I know.  We know enough truckers.  I've had enough shit shipped. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, we know.  When I buy something from Amazon, when I buy something from Amazon, I go like, all right,  next day.  And you know what?  It's there the next day from, like, Guam.  Unless it's your pornography, which case is Thailand.  So what's the issue?  I have no idea.  But no one does.  It's crazy.  But Bloomberg is.  Well, instead of having convoys of tankers bringing gas into the city, I'm glad they're  worried about the content of trans fats and homeless donations. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, that's the important thing.  He's such a cocksucker, this guy.  He's a cocksucker.  People are getting out of the garbage.  How out of touch are you?  They'll appreciate anything that isn't half eaten.  How about a word at the national level, too?  How about a little word from the newly elected shithead about some federal funding, what's  going on?  This is a major catastrophe in the Northeast.  And he takes one fucking visit to Jersey so he can do a photo op of Christie and fuck 
[00:36:30]  Romney a little bit.  And then he just disappears?  No, he's overseas.  He's in Asia.  He's in Asia.  Oh, his old fucking, his old haunts?  It's not working anymore.  Yeah.  You lost.  What?  Oh, I know I did.  Now I don't even talk about politics.  It's just strictly race.  That's what I do now.  It doesn't have to say oof.  No, it doesn't.  I see people out there.  See people. 
[00:37:00]  And they're still trying to fight the good fight.  I'm like, give it up.  Unfortunately, it's time to give it up for a couple of years.  But even stupid Ed Schultz, stupid Ed Schultz last night was talking about, well, why were  white people able to go right in and vote?  And minorities had to stand on line.  You won.  Shut it.  I have turned all of them off.  I haven't watched.  I have not fucking watched.  I shouldn't even have watched The Moonshiners.  Second season of The Moonshiners.  Oh, my God.  Have you seen that? 
[00:37:30]  Do you have to pick up, is it a city law that you have to pick up your TV in a plastic  bag when you're done watching it and put it in its proper receptacle?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  You watch shit.  Oh, I know.  I love it, though.  I watched a lot of good real shit.  You watch The Moonshiners?  I really don't.  But I saw the commercial and I'm like, you know what?  I might have to watch this.  I hear it's all fake, though, because you're not allowed to do what they say they're doing.  Yeah, and then Nucky's trying to get the gas from Atlantic City up to New York. 
[00:38:00]  Nucky, yes.  But he can't do it because Chip is blocking the roads.  I work for a tanker company.  We offered to bring three tankers to New York and they turned us away.  There's a shortage of drivers.  I'm a gas whore.  I got 12,000 gallons on and you can't have any.  Bring it to my house.  I'm a tank driver.  The terminals up here are out of gas because we are shipping it down to you.  I saw military tankers headed toward Jersey. 
[00:38:30]  They're shipping the fuel from Ohio.  Well, whatever it is, it's not enough and it's not quick enough.  The response was shit on this gas issue.  Shit, when you're going 11 days in New York City and still huge gas lines and he just  enacts out even, your response time stinks and there should be a fucking investigation  about what happened and who dropped the ball and who had the balls across their fucking  nose.  Yeah, we should run the marathon and show everybody that the city, that's what you're doing is 
[00:39:00]  you want to run the marathon so you can show everybody what their next mode of transportation  is going to be, you fucking cocksucker.  We don't have water!  And you don't have gasoline!  I hear he's had some good rants on the power issue.  Is this a good commercial for the Moonshiners?  Just like a preview clip.  You want to see a preview clip?  Yes, please.  All right, let's start.  It's on Discovery, I guess.  I didn't even know this show was out there.  It's called Moonshiners.  Jeff's mentor and living legend, James Thomas, has been making moonshine and copper moonshine 
[00:39:30]  still since he was 12 years old.  Hello!  I was named Dr. My Daddy.  His name was Marvin Albert.  That guy is 28 years old.  That moonshine will get you.  My grandmother named me Jim Thomas.  No fucking teeth.  Jim Thomas taught most the locals almost all there is to know.  about the art of moonshine. 
[00:40:00]  Look here.  Let me check this.  Ah!  It's over a hundred.  Look at them are frog eyes.  Oh, God.  What's frog eyes?  He said, look at them frog eyes.  He was looking at a jar full of moonshine.  He said that.  Tax-free.  I don't know.  So it's no wonder every season...  Whatever.  It's more visual, but fuck.  What, you have to dig a big hole to make your moonshine?  I guess, what, hide your still? 
[00:40:30]  I guess.  Reveners!  I had a friend.  Well, I'm still friends with him, Fred.  And when he was going back up to Geneseo...  So that's not a guy that you trashed on the air?  Not a friend from the past that you've gone on the air?  Destroyed?  Destroyed?  I didn't know!  Sam set me up, I think.  He certainly did.  And if you remember, I was tapping out very early on that one.  There was something that wasn't right about the Jim Chandler tapes.  Not that early, though.  Now known as the Jim Chandler tapes. 
[00:41:00]  Yes.  No, Fred was in my fraternity, and he went to Geneseo like I did, and he was from Long  Island like I did, and he would take the long way, when we came back, let's say, from a  break, from summer break, Christmas break, whatever, okay?  He would take the long way to go get moonshine in Pennsylvania somewhere.  He knew where all this shit was.  Oh, yeah, they made that in Pennsylvania, yeah.  And bring it back for the fraternity, and I gotta tell you, what the fuck?  That shit's crazy.  I don't need a buzz that badly.  Yeah, that shit just burns your throat.  That shit was horrendous to drink. 
[00:41:30]  Is it Everclear?  Great alcohol?  I mean, this goes back.  Everclear's the worst.  You know, this goes back a while now.  A good 10, 12 years.  Yeah.  Of course.  10, 12 years.  I don't remember anymore.  I do remember it was just god-awful, though.  There was nothing fun about drinking moonshine.  And then we tried to throw it in punch and all that shit just to fucking get some kind of  flavor, man.  But it was brutal to drink.  I don't know why people would drink that shit.  Vodka and all that stuff would do the same job, but no? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  I remember Fred was all about his moonshine, and he would come back with these big fucking  jars of just Everclear.  Oh, that shit is deadly.  And we would have a big moonshine party.  You can't breathe when you do a shot of that.  Like, you can't.  It freezes the back of your throat.  It was brutal, man.  Terrible.  Like I said, I don't remember much, but I do remember just how god-awful it went down.  Horrible.  Yeah.  So, whatever.  That Juan Reyes out in California, that guy that shot his son on the shoulder in the desert, 
[00:42:30]  my other story.  With the blood that went...  Yeah, yeah.  Like a fucking fountain.  He used to get these kegs from this whiskey distillery, these giant wooden kegs, and he'd  put a couple of gallons of water in it and then just lay it on its side.  And every week or so, he would roll it a little bit, you know, just roll it over a little  and a little more, and after, like, two months of doing this, the water would kind of leach  the whiskey out of the wood from the barrel, and you'd have fucking, like, this homebrew 
[00:43:00]  kind of stuff that was...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm lost here.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know how you make whiskey.  Uh, well, it's not making whiskey.  This guy would take the old whiskey casks that they used to store the whiskey in.  Oh, so that is...  And he would buy them from the whiskey distillery.  Oh, so it was all seeped into the wood.  Yeah, so it would all be in the wood.  All the alcohol and shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Gotcha.  And then he would put water in there and lay it on its side and roll it, like, every couple  of weeks, he would roll it over a little more, roll it, so that it would have a new 
[00:43:30]  thing of wood that the water was actually laying on.  Because it was only a little bit of water he would put in there, a couple of gallons.  And then he'd pour it out after, like, months, and it would, it would taste really good,  really smooth, and you would get so fucked up on it.  So fucked up.  So this drunk figured out a way to suck the whiskey out of the fucking wood?  Yes.  And he saw just this wood laying around and said, fuck.  Wooden casks.  How did he learn how to do that?  Yeah, it was, it was amazing. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know, but it was really good, too.  You know why I asked that?  Because there was no internet back then.  No.  I don't know how.  You just had to know that shit, or someone had to tell you at a bar somewhere.  He was shaking one day, and he saw a piece of whiskey wood, and he just licked it, and  he goes, I gotta figure out how to get the liquor out of it.  How could I get this goodness in me?  And I shouldn't even know how good it was because of my age at the time, but I certainly  did.  How old were you?  I had to be 13.  I can't even.  And I was fucking doing these fucking shots of this shit, washing down with some ice  cold Coors.  I was such a fucking faggot. 
[00:44:30]  Ice cold Coors.  I was, I just always knew that it was just wrong at that age, so I never even fucking...  Well, I was in man training.  My father put me in man training because I was a little faggot when I was growing up.  I was constantly pissy-eyed and crying.  Right.  So my dad finally decided to put me in man training, which entailed fucking women, drinking  alcohol, riding horses, shooting guns, and not crying, regardless if, as he said, you 
[00:45:00]  have a fucking arrow in your chest.  I don't want to see them pissy eyes.  I don't want to hear you cry if you have an arrow in your chest.  How's that going to happen, Dad?  How did that work out for you?  Uh, well, I pretty much cut off all emotion and haven't cried since.  Yep.  It's amazing.  You're still waiting for that arrow to show up, aren't you?  Yes.  How bad...  Where's that arrow?  I hope that arrow shows up.  Jimmy, how badly do you think Anthony wants to have just a good cry?  Oh, my God.  How badly?  Just a good cry like the old days.  It comes out in racial anger and screams at cabbies, but what it really is, is little 
[00:45:30]  spaghetti boy wanting to curl up in his fucking girl's underpants and just cry under his  comforter.  Spaghetti.  You want to have a good cry, don't you?  Uh, nah.  When was the last time you cried?  If you cried as you...  I'm going to guess last Tuesday.  Very good.  When was the last time?  Do you even know?  Oh, my God.  For a boy that cried a lot. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, my God.  Like, how do you just shut it off?  It's gone.  It had to be 1995, I think.  Oh, boy.  I know why.  Oh, that was when my dad passed away.  Did you actually cry?  Yeah, I gave it a good five minutes.  But were you fucking crying?  No, it was kind of a, you know, like, boy, I was thinking back and, you know, some tears  running down.  Not like...  Not like one of those, but... 
[00:46:30]  You need one of those.  Why?  Why?  No, you don't.  That's exactly right there.  See, that's why.  Right there.  Instead of crying, it comes out and...  He just...  Protect, protect, protect me.  And what happens is all this air is in this rotten little Italian balloon.  And instead of coming out the...  These little holes keep popping up and it goes...  Yeah, wow.  You fucking get intense immediately. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  That's why.  I don't.  The occasional cry is good for you.  It's very cleansing.  It's an emotional release.  And when you have 17 years or 20 years without that, it comes out in all these crazy ways.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I love it.  I love a good cry.  You can't just do it, though.  You need the fucking sad emotion.  No, I agree.  But you also need to not block it.  But I, you know...  You're not blocking anything.  I don't believe that.  You're talking about...  See?  See?  I just did it on purpose.  I know.  Your name should be Anthony Doors Cumia. 
[00:47:30]  Fuck, man.  Drinking whiskey at 13.  Yeah.  We had my grandma's beach house and every once in a while we would have a sip of our  uncle's beers.  Oh, no.  Oh, good.  And we thought we were like...  The mule.  And then we'd brag about it the rest of the day.  It was one stupid fucking sip.  Really?  Such idiots.  Nothing was happening all of a sudden.  And the uncle would be cool.  Like, hey, you want a sip?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll try that.  You know, at 12, 13.  And then I'd walk around bragging that I'd fucking drink a beer with my uncle. 
[00:48:00]  A little sip of road soda.  I had a fucking sip of a road soda.  That's right, Jimmy.  The fucking...  But the buzz I got from the first beer I drank was just fantastic.  It was an ice-cold Coors.  You've been chasing that ever since, huh?  Oh, God.  How could you not?  I fucking drank that down, and it was this weird kind of, whoa, this is great.  It was fucking looted off of one fucking can of Coors.  Sure.  It was great, though.  And you've been following that fucking carrot around a track. 
[00:48:30]  It drives an Escalade.  It drives a Shelby, but you can never catch it.  Some Coors.  By the way, Dan Mooney in New York City.  Frog eyes are the bubbles.  They represent potency in Moonshine.  Oh, okay.  Because I got, look at me, frog eyes.  Frog eyes.  Bubbles.  Why?  I guess the more bubbles, the more potent it is?  I guess.  Moonshine's brutal, man.  That is crazy shit.  Fucking brutal.  Think these guys that just drink it straight?  Oh, yeah.  Look at their faces. 
[00:49:00]  They love it.  That's crazy.  I bet you it looked at like a little fucking, you know...  A Mary if you drink it.  A Mary if you fucking flavor up your Moonshine, I would assume.  Yeah.  But I know they do do that.  Do do?  What do they make it with?  What's the main ingredient in Moonshine?  Is it sugar?  Like, what is it?  I think it's corn mash.  What is corn mash?  Just from corn, you mash it up?  Is it just that simple?  Yeah, corn mash.  Oh, okay.  I think they...  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I'm not sure how they do it.  It's a lot of boiling.  A lot of fermenting.  Oh.  How long does it take?  I don't know.  I don't know much about stills.  Yeah, we got...  Distilling.  We got Voss and Bonnie outside.  We got a busy show.  Oh, the big documentary makers.  Yes.  Big shots.  Fucking big shots.  Big shots.  Their movie finally premieres this weekend.  I'm actually very excited for that.  At Caroline's, yes.  They've worked really hard on it.  Yeah.  For years, man.  I think they started this like three years ago.  Wait, is it Caroline's?  I'm sorry.  I don't want to give the wrong information.  You know what?  One o'clock tomorrow at Caroline's. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, it is.  Okay.  As part of the comedy festival, they're having a pre-screening.  That's great.  That's awesome of the movie Women Aren't Funny.  And we're in it, I believe.  We got a little taste in that movie.  Nice.  Also, we got Brian Regan coming by.  And Sir Roger Moore.  Sir Roger Moore.  Can I play this Mr. Rogers that I teased earlier in a break?  Yes.  It's on the YouTube.  It's called Mr. Rogers Remix. 
[00:50:30]  Something Garden.  It's Garden in My Mind.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The one that has 7.4 million views.  Wow.  And put it on our Facebook page.  Nowhere near Surprised Kitten.  No, of course not.  I'll tell you that much.  Surprised Kitten is fucking adorable.  Surprised Kitten, greatest video ever on YouTube.  It is really cute.  Well, I like this one today.  This is what I'm fucking...  I like Surprised fucking Boeing Engineer in the award video.  Also, I got a remix for Jimmy for the next break. 
[00:51:00]  Someone took our two favorite bands and put them into one.  Sabbath and Zeppelin.  War Pigs and Whole Lotta Love.  It's good.  Whole Lotta War Pigs.  Not bad.  Not fucking bad.  We'll play that a little later.  But first is Mr. Rogers Remix.  Hi, neighbor.  Welcome again to this neighborhood.  I'd like to show you something.  You know what this is?  Maybe if I press this button. 
[00:51:30]  This is a cassette player with a little cassette in here.  And there's nothing written on it.  So we'll just have to play it to see what it is.  Do you ever imagine things?  Are they scary things?  Do you ever imagine things?  Things you'd like to have?  Did you ever see a cat's eyes in the dark and wonder what they were?  Did you ever pretend about things like that before?  Did you ever pretend about things like that?  Did you ever grow anything in the garden of your mind? 
[00:52:00]  In the garden of your mind.  You can grow ideas in the garden of your mind.  In the garden of your mind.  It's good to be curious about many things.  You can think about things and make believe.  All you have to do is think and they'll grow.  Imagine every person that you see is somewhat different from every other person in the world. 
[00:52:30]  Some can do some things.  Some can do others.  Did you ever think of the many things you've learned to do?  Many things you've learned.  Did you ever grow anything in the garden of your mind?  You can grow ideas in the garden of your mind.  It's good to be curious about many things. 
[00:53:00]  You can think about things and make believe.  All you have to do is think and they'll grow.  Did you feel like going like that?  Let's give the fish some food.  Mr. McPhee's lake.  I didn't order any whistles.  That's what they call a slide whistle. 
[00:53:30]  Don't you feel like going like that?  There are so many things to learn about in this world.  And so many people who can help us learn.  And so many people who can help us learn.  Did you ever grow anything in the garden of your mind?  You can grow ideas in the garden of your mind.  It's good to be curious about many things.  You can think about things and make believe. 
[00:54:00]  All you have to do is think.  You can think about things and make believe.  All you have to do is think.  And they'll grow.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  What's Sirius XM?

[00:55:00]  Fuck you, dirty bitches.  Fuck you!  Yeah, hi, this is Sal.  Um, I just want to say fuck you to myself  because I'm just too big of a bitch  to get my ass to go to work when it's sprinkling outside.  My mommy told me it wouldn't be very safe,  so, you know, unless I got her walking behind me to wipe my ass,  I'm just too afraid to do anything.  Fuck you, me!  Fuck you!  Fuck you, Louis C.K.  You've made it, brother.  I watched you on Saturday night and live tonight.  You're fucking hilarious.  And sorry to hear that, Opie and Anthony.

Last time I checked, this is the Opie and Anthony show,  not the Opie and Anthony and Sam Roberts show.  So, shut your fucking mouth, you fucking douchebag.  Fuck you!  That's my damn style!  Fuck you, Anarchy Radio!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I just wanted to listen to Jacktober,

[00:56:30]  I know it's going to get ugly,  so I just want to start by saying  I'm very proud of Rich and Bonnie 
[00:57:00]  because their new movie,  Women Aren't Funny,  will be premiering tomorrow  at 1 o'clock at Caroline's.  It's a sneak peek.  It's not a premiere.  It's a sneak peek.  Can anyone go?  Yeah.  It's only 15 bucks for a...  But you get a panel.  Yeah, we're going to do a panel after it.  So the place should be packed.  It should be.  I hope so.  This movie you guys have been working on for like...  I've never asked anybody to do anything, ever.  Right.  My one thing.  Yeah.  Fucking...  So I paid a mortgage.  You guys started this three years ago. 
[00:57:30]  Three years in August,  so it's August...  Was it...  A little over three years.  Three years.  Three years to make this.  It's crazy.  Over three years ago,  and it finally premieres  tomorrow at Caroline's.  I've seen many, many versions of this movie.  Yeah, sorry.  It's very, very good.  Yeah.  It's a very good movie.  Thank you.  I've only seen one,  and I liked what I saw a lot.  It was very funny.  And Bonnie was very funny in it.  Thank you.  The amount of...  I mean, Bonnie was definitely great.  The amount of comics you have in this movie...  Did you ever add it up?  No.  No, but I mean,  the list goes fucking on and on. 
[00:58:00]  How many would you guess?  40?  Yes, probably.  You think that many?  Yeah.  Probably.  I mean,  whenever you start listing them,  you're like,  I can't believe that there's that many people in it.  Yeah, I mean...  The credits take a long time.  Wanda, Sarah, Lisa,  all of them fucking...  Chris Tucker?  Chris Tucker?  No, no.  Chris Hammonds.  Oh, Chris Rock.  Dane is in it.  I mean...  Joan Rivers.  Everybody.  Sarah Silverman.  Artie Lang. 
[00:58:30]  Wanda.  Lisa Lampanelli.  Poopy and Anthony.  You guys are throughout the movie,  you guys are the anchor of the movie.  No, you're like the anchors of the movie.  Ooh.  And we look like Albatross.  Yeah.  And we look really good  because it was three years ago.  People get to see us and go,  saw you in the movie.  What the fuck happened to you?  I'll tell you what happened.  Three years happened.  Leave me alone.  I got two kids.  Shut up.  Actually,  Anthony launches the whole thing with his...  Oh, I know. 
[00:59:00]  With his stare at you?  With his...  That stare that you give Bonnie?  He's so mean in the beginning.  You basically say,  no, women aren't funny.  You just stare at Bonnie like,  your turn.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Your turn.  Grace.  He's great.  Patrice is fucking great.  Patrice is in the movie.  Colin fucking Brewer.  And a lot of alternative comics.  You know,  Jimmy Carr's in it from England.  Alternative to funny.  Was Jimmy in it?  I didn't even remember him.  I remember down in...  He was in Montreal in the basement. 
[00:59:30]  He's licking the straw and going to Bonnie.  I don't remember.  Do you have a gay following?  And Bonnie goes,  I do too many AIDS jokes.  Oh, that got cut.  That one scene.  You didn't take that out.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  It's a fucking great scene.  Oh, yeah.  Here they go.  Here they go.  I cut it because...  I had to...  I mean,  I had to take 10 minutes out of the...  We did a final cut  and then I had to take another 10 minutes out.  How long was the final cut?  It's 80 minutes now.  Oh, now it's 79 minutes.  You didn't want it to be 90?  No, not for a documentary.  Is it us too long?  Yeah, well, we can't... 
[01:00:00]  That's what my buddy Morgan Spurlock told me.  Morgan Spurlock.  You know, that is the magic number.  You want to be at 80.  There they go.  For whatever reason.  I don't really understand that myself.  I love when you two just get into it.  Yeah.  It's just like,  Hey, why'd you...  Why, why, why...  Gracie, why'd you cut that movie?  Hey, you too.  Oh, you too.  What'd you cut from the...  And how do you say it?  Pippi, why did you...  What'd you cut from the movie real fast?  Uh, just some AIDS jokes.  Oh.  No, you took...  Well, Kelsey was in a lot of it.  So what else does Jim do in the movie? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, Jimmy, I'm kidding.  That's what I read on Twitter.  We took out one scene...  You know, he doesn't care what every scene we took out of the movie.  He just said, what did you take out of the fucking movie?  I think he was talking about the thing that we were...  If you've done more radio, you'd pay attention.  It's not all about you.  Listen.  You gotta listen, then you respond.  Listen, respond.  That's how we do it here.  You should say that in the mirror every morning.  Did he just say, that's how we do it here?  We do it here.  Oh, good.  Like, he's just part of the guy.  Look at the crew. 
[01:01:00]  I see your name on the fucking wallpaper.  Okay, yeah.  Look at the door.  It's sad.  Go look on the door.  Well, you're proud of that?  Huh?  You're proud of what we have from you on the door?  The tribute.  It's every word you've mispronounced on our show.  Oh, shit.  I was going to suggest to the game, you say one of his friends' names, and then you look  up in his phone how he spelled it.  Oh, is that really bad, right?  He had my name in his phone spelled wrong until about seven months ago.  B-O-N-N-Y?  Wait, Boney?  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Boney.  No, it was the last name that he got wrong.  Oh.  That's when I first started banging.  I never changed it.  I didn't even think I was going to keep it in there.  Holy shit.  First of all, let me say thank you.  Yeah, that is.  Oh, no.  What?  Did you really say the three Stoogers?  Yeah.  I remember that one.  Oh, yeah.  You should make a dumb book out of that.  Yeah, that's very funny.  You should have a book of voices.  Yeah, a little coffee table book.  That would sell pretty well.  Yeah.  Like a good toilet read.  It's very funny.  Yeah.  We have a whole list of the words. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, we haven't talked about the list in a while.  Oh, my God.  Maybe I'll get a ghostwriter.  Yeah, you have to.  And I think we gave up on the list.  We gave up on the list.  We shouldn't do.  That's a great list.  Look how long it is.  Oh, God.  That's great.  There's got to be a thousand words on there.  That's a thousand words on there.  That's his entire vocabulary.  Yeah.  And every word is wrong.  It's only words.  Yeah.  Everybody knows.  Everybody gets it.  It's only words.  Yeah, he'll say words wrong over and over.  And then I'll be like, just learn it.  So that you just remember it for next time.  And he'll be like, who cares? 
[01:02:30]  People know what I'm talking about.  She's like, what do you think?  You're like a fucking queen.  You say these big words like you're going to impress me.  Give us one of the big words.  What's the big words?  What's one of the big words?  I don't know.  Fucking tell me one of your words that you say.  I don't know.  But I can't even think of it.  I'm sure it's not a big word to everybody else.  I'm sure.  No, but he'll be like, you're just using that to fuck with me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So how much money did this movie? 
[01:03:00]  What's that?  How much money in the end?  I need to know.  You know, it's funny.  I need to know.  It's really nothing in the big scheme of things.  But for you guys, it's everything.  It's everything he had.  I put all my money into her dream.  Oh, boy.  A little husband.  Tapped you out.  I'm close.  I mean, let me tell you.  Now, you know, I'm starting to walk golf courses instead of riding.  So you guys are a little nervous.  I'm a fucking mess. 
[01:03:30]  I'm not.  Yeah.  It's all or nothing with this, right?  I'm done.  I feel like, okay, next.  I don't even care about it anymore.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  What the fuck?  You're not talking about the movie, Richard.  Yeah.  There's a lot in it.  And we even have somebody else.  Some money of theirs.  Well, you might.  Yeah.  I think we'll get it back.  I might be an investor.  Ah.  You got some credits.  I might be an investor.  I bought a credit. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  I bought myself into it.  I'm kind of not worried.  We already had an offer to sell it.  You know, so.  And, you know, everybody that sees it, you know, wants to get involved with it.  They just see money.  The name alone is worth a lot of money.  You know, women aren't funny.  It's women.  Very controversial.  It's women.  Women aren't funny.  Women aren't funny.  Yeah.  He says it wrong every time.  And here's the thing.  He'll even, he'll be like, which one is it again?  Woman or women?  Oh, no. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, Rich.  And then he'll be like, he asked me how to spell women.  No.  I was like, we've been working on this movie for four years.  You never figured out which one it is.  Do you understand one's plural and one's not?  Doesn't she look like she's getting ready to fly across country on the first flight?  Fucking Amelia Earhart.  That's right.  You too.  Take your freckle cream, stupid fucking Amelia Blowheart.  That would be a blowheart.  Wow.  You'd have used that one.  Well, it's been wonderful talking with you fellas.  I've got it in going.  Yes. 
[01:05:00]  Yes.  The headphones with the glasses on your head.  I know.  And the scarf.  It's perfect.  Right in the middle of a smashing pill.  Oh, my God.  Boss can punch himself out of anything.  Wow, that is good.  I've got to get a picture of that.  Because that's fucking funny.  Get your hand out of there, Jimmy.  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's fucking funny.  Women aren't funny there, Rich Voss.  Yeah.  The woman.  Did you? 
[01:05:30]  That's hilarious.  Okay, so we got a hotel room the other.  Tell how we got the hotel room.  What do you mean?  Okay, so Wednesday and Thursday.  Wednesday, she was doing a podcast, Keith and the Girl.  And I was going to do it Thursday, right?  What's Keith and the Girl?  I've heard of them.  I can't keep up with all these podcasts.  Yeah.  But they're in Queens.  What the hell is Keith and the Girl?  They were like the first, one of the first to do podcasts. 
[01:06:00]  Who's Keith?  Somebody with my name up there.  That's how Rich used to spell my name.  Who's Keith?  Is he a comic?  He's the guy of the show.  No, they used to be a couple and they split up.  They're not a couple anymore.  And then he turned her off Gentleman Altogether.  And they just do a podcast.  They rent a place in Queens.  And there was tons and tons of times I was doing Carolines or places.  And they go, you want to do Keith and the Girl?  I'm going, I'm not going to Queens to do a podcast. 
[01:06:30]  And then we ended up doing it.  And they were actually, it was a lot of fun.  They were good.  And you think that they're real because they have foam on the wall, right?  You're like, whoa, this is serious shit.  Like acoustic foam on the wall and shit.  She's like, okay, all right, I'll do this again.  You're going to get foam for your podcast now?  Can't afford it.  So we're going to get a movie.  Jesus.  Just put it at crates.  Yeah, I don't like cartons.  Yeah, head cartons right there.  When I get back from my trip, we'll look into it. 
[01:07:00]  Yes.  So we're going to hold.  I was going to do it.  Contact.  She was going to do it Wednesday.  I was going to do it Thursday.  We had to go do some shows in New York.  Had to go to the editing house.  So I said, I'll get a.  This guy tells a story, man.  I'm telling.  He's got a bit of yarn, can't he?  Yeah, you really got me.  In real time, he loves telling stories.  He doesn't know what's important information.  Oh, my God.  Edit yourself.  He doesn't know what's important.  I'm going to fucking go for this again today.  Like, everybody attacking me.  This is not going to happen.  No one's attacking you, but you really should get to the point.  What did you say?  Edit your story. 
[01:07:30]  He said tell.  So maybe we could tell five stories instead of one.  We were going to go to the edit house.  Okay.  And Anthony had a nap, and he's looking at his phone.  I know.  You're losing the crowd.  You mentioned a podcast no one even knows about.  Is that what you asked about it, and we told you about it now?  I was going to go to the edit house.  But then I realized I shouldn't have asked a question, because I still don't know anything  about them.  Do you have a podcast?  What do you want to know about them?  I don't want to know anything anymore.  Trust me.  So we had a lot of things going on.  So I got a hotel room on Priceline, which ended up in fucking Chinatown. 
[01:08:00]  Nice.  On Priceline.  So we're going from the one thing to the other.  From the podcast, too.  And then we're going to the hotel, and then we have to go back to Long Island City to do  a show with Colin Quinn.  And as we're driving to the hotel, Rich says to me, okay, so when we get to the hotel,  we'll put our stuff up in the hotel, and then we'll come back, and we'll sit in the  car for a couple of hours.  Well, because you don't want to pay for parking for two hours.  You've got a hotel, and he wanted us to have a nap in the car.  So he wouldn't have to pay extra for the... 
[01:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Can't you find, like, parking on the street or something?  Not that time.  After seven, it was five.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  You'd rather just sit in a car?  Yeah.  Yeah, and chill out.  Yeah, that's what kind of...  Oh, what a capital J.  Literally chill out.  Wait a minute.  Freeze.  Wait, you got all shortages?  Yeah.  You got a hotel room, but you...  Yes.  To save the parking?  By the time we parked and got into the hotel room,  by the time we parked...  I'm never getting my money back.  Yeah, that's why I didn't want to get to parking.  I might as well kiss that money goodbye. 
[01:09:00]  By the time you park, you go up to the hotel,  and you got to come right back down, so...  It's 20 bucks.  It's not the money.  Down in Chinatown, especially.  It's probably 20 bucks for a couple hours.  Whatever.  So I parked the car with the meters,  and I had to fucking run back down.  It's a pain in the neck.  And we were in the hotel for an hour,  and then we drove all the way back to Queens.  You know, it's a fucking hour.  Why didn't you just hang in Queens and do something?  We didn't realize...  We didn't know it was going to take that.  It was like, you know, four or five hours we had, 
[01:09:30]  but by the time we got back to the hotel...  Traffic, okay.  Traffic, and then going back to Queens.  Getting a little bite to eat, having an argument.  So, you know...  It takes time.  So you didn't have to stay in the car?  No.  I said no.  Holy fuck.  You said no to that.  I said this will not be happening.  That's dumb.  That's weird shit.  Yeah.  I mean, when I was driving home from Florida,  I got hotels.  I wouldn't sleep in the car, you know.  Although I was planning on it, so...  Do you know what he's doing here?  What?  He's letting you know he drove back from Florida. 
[01:10:00]  No, they don't.  Okay.  He called, and we hung up on it.  Oh, he did call.  And we hung up on it.  I'm in the middle of a fucking storm.  I'm in the middle of it.  And he's like,  I don't know if I should try to fly or get a hotel,  or should I keep driving?  My butt hurts.  I don't know what I should...  I'm like,  I gotta go.  Well, what's going on over there?  I gotta...  Should I do...  He called...  I had to hang up on him.  I was like,  I can't deal with you.  So did we.  Yeah.  Because no one knew what was going to happen with this storm. 
[01:10:30]  You got a little fucking daughter.  Yeah, and I didn't want her...  I didn't want to say to him,  look, I'm fucking scared right now.  I can't deal with your bullshit.  Was he worried more about himself?  Raina was sitting right there.  I had to be like,  we're fine,  but he doesn't hear in my voice.  I'm like,  we're fine.  We'll be okay.  Uh-huh.  Oh, so it's not so bad.  Okay.  It's only the storm of the century.  He can't...  He didn't read your voice instruction.  I love you, Rich.  I really do.  He called a hundred times. 
[01:11:00]  Well, I don't know if I should take a try to get to Jacksonville,  or I should try to drive to Atlanta.  Why didn't you fly to Chicago and drive from there?  It's a 12-hour drive instead of 24, 25.  There was no flight out of Florida.  Oh, okay.  Out of Fort Lauderdale.  None.  None.  Why?  Oh, should I just stay in Florida?  What am I going to do?  I'm not going to golf for three days.  I don't know.  And what's going on?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Rich.  You're hoping your house doesn't blow away. 
[01:11:30]  I just wanted to get home to my wife and child,  and I fucking was driving,  and then you would call the airline.  How many days did they take you?  Two, but you call...  Like, I'm driving.  I'm in Jacksonville.  So I call the airline.  I go, can I fly out of Myrtle, out of South Carolina?  And they...  Yes.  That was Tuesday.  So...  No, Wednesday.  So Tuesday.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  This is what...  This is exactly the point we hung up on him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he was giving us his flight options. 
[01:12:00]  I'm like, just tell us what you...  No, but you're about to get home.  I go, make a fucking decision and stick to it.  I don't care what you do.  Why are you getting so mad?  I'm just trying to let you know.  So you're on the plane,  and then all of a sudden John Candy sat next to you.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead.  I got it.  Thank you, bro.  I got that one.  So, you know, and then I'm driving.  I get to South Carolina on Tuesday,  and I'm going, well, I could fly out Wednesday morning,  save 11 hours of fucking driving 12 from South.  Could you do that with this story? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, exactly.  You won't stop.  It's like, I've heard this at three...  Anytime I've been like,  I just can't listen to you right now,  I'd be like, okay, okay.  I'm just letting you know  that I have a flight available.  Were you tired of the same story?  It was endless.  It was endless.  But that's Rich.  He's like, I'm in the middle of a storm with our daughter.  Don't know what's going to happen.  No power.  And yet he...  Like, I was like, just stay in Florida.  It's fine, you know.  But he couldn't because it wouldn't be about him. 
[01:13:00]  You know what I mean?  He had to really, like...  And then he has to make it so that...  He has to also frame it so that I'm doing this for you.  Oh, boy.  You had to get home because you can't handle that.  I had to tell you how to tape the windows.  Put X's on the windows.  Thanks.  And she put it on with duct tape,  and now there's fucking duct tape glue  all over the fucking windows.  What kind of tape should she use?  Do you put X's on your window?  First of all...  I put X's on my windows,  but then I put a little additional things on them, too.  And some K's. 
[01:13:30]  So what kind of tape should she use for windows?  I wouldn't know that.  I used an electrical tape, actually.  Yeah, maybe like a...  What do you call a tape?  You know, like the blue tape that...  Painters tape.  Painters tape.  Is that strong enough?  It's just so the glass doesn't shatter when it breaks.  Well, I was in my Lowe's after I drove around for two hours  waiting for a parking spot to open up  as everyone was taking out generators and every...  Our Lowe's, the shelves were bare. 
[01:14:00]  The Lowe's.  Like, I went to go get a flashlight.  I ended up just having...  Yeah, and there was one in the car.  This is fucking...  Oh, no.  How about the iPhone app?  So clueless.  There's an iPhone app that has a flashlight.  I know.  Yeah, that's a powerful enough during the storm.  It is, actually.  That thing's pretty handy.  It's pretty good.  It uses the flash on the back.  Wait, you heard...  She got a flashlight and Rich is mad because there was a flashlight in the car.  Right in the car.  She's so unaware of what goes on around her.  She's just clueless.  So what?  I had...  She's like a savant.  It was a storm and I had very little anxiety, you know, until you got home. 
[01:14:30]  And when you got home, I was like, why do I have...  Like, I want to...  I just...  And when I got home, I go, why is she still here?  So we both had fucking anxiety.  So shut up.  I feel like I'm hanging with celebrities today because I'm a huge fan of their podcast because  of this.  It's one of the only podcasts I still listen to on a regular basis.  Oh, my God.  I hate doing it.  I know you do.  That's what I love, too.  Someone tweeted me, it's not a podcast until Bonnie turns off the dishwasher. 
[01:15:00]  We always, five minutes in, I'm like, oh, I should turn off the dishwasher.  You just hear it in the background.  You two are exhausting.  I know.  Do we still love each other?  I don't know.  We're friends.  What is love?  We had sex the other night.  How was it?  That was pretty good.  She left a big stain on my fucking bed.  I'm going to die.  It was fucking horrible.  I'm looking at it.  It's probably tears.  I thought it was my drool, but I didn't sleep.  Did I doze off for you to come?  I don't know what happened. 
[01:15:30]  That was my hopes and dreams.  She won't do 69.  We've never done 69.  We've been married almost a...  I like 69.  She won't do it.  Why?  A working vacation.  He sets me up for this all the time.  I love the line.  It's a good line.  Do you really hate it?  I don't want to...  No.  I just want to like...  I guess I have to get my head in a certain space first, and then it's a lot of work.  It's a lot of work being a lady.  She won't let me put my tongue in her ass? 
[01:16:00]  You should just take charge and do that.  I have to side with Rich on that one.  Or fingers.  Just take charge.  Fingers in the ass is one thing.  Some people always say...  No, she won't put them in mine.  I'm the mother of your child.  Yeah.  I don't know if you want to just be talking about that stuff.  Oh, you're right.  I'm sorry.  It's easy.  I mean, you're right.  We shouldn't talk about that.  Why?  Huh?  That's the greatest thing to talk about.  That is common relationship stuff, though.  It's those weird little things that you...  No one thinks to talk about that on a date.  Like, would you let me lick your ass?  No.  It never comes up until you fucking... 
[01:16:30]  No.  No, it came up.  There, in the action.  No, I said no.  And what do they say to you?  Not until you make your first payment?  Nothing.  Sorry.  Rich, why?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's an addiction.  So, the movie.  Yeah.  No, I love her.  You don't love me?  Why would you say, I guess?  Holy fuck.  See, you know...  Okay, but look it.  You said we're friends.  And did I get all bent out of shape?  No.  No, because you don't care.  Because the movie's done. 
[01:17:00]  That's right.  That's right, baby.  He accuses me all the time of looking out for myself.  And that he looks out for both of us.  But I only look out for both of us.  I mainly do look out for both of us.  Yeah?  I do.  Yeah.  I mean, she's selfish.  That's how females are, because they're used to being taken care of.  And she does stuff around the house.  She's a good cook, although she stopped eating.  She's a vegetarian now, so she fucked up everybody's menu.  The other night, I'm starving.  She goes, I go, let's go get some turkey burgers. 
[01:17:30]  Why don't we just have vegetables?  What, are we fucking surviving in the woods?  Why don't we just have vegetables?  Go fuck yourself, cauliflower.  I want turkey burgers.  I tried a veggie burger once.  Stinks.  They're terrible.  Stinks.  She has tofu burgers.  Oh, my God.  We sit there like normal.  My older daughters will come over, eating like good food.  And she sits there with a fucking tofu burger.  And she eats like she's a fucking royalty.  And it's just horrible.  With my mouth closed. 
[01:18:00]  That's what he means by that?  Yes.  You're all fancy, not dropping half a bit out of your mouth.  No, I've got one foot up on the table.  Don't get me wrong.  Do you feel healthier?  I don't feel that different, really.  Oh, really?  I thought I was going to have a lot more energy and stuff.  So now you're just suffering for no reason.  I don't really.  You don't feel like you're suffering?  No.  I don't miss it at all.  Wow.  How long?  I tried veggie burgers.  It was like a year.  Health reason or ethical reasons?  Well, meat started to gross me out.  Like, you know, I don't know.  Maybe if I was buying organic or something. 
[01:18:30]  Rich just threw me off meat.  You hear us a lot, though.  What grossed you out about meat?  What is it about meat that grosses people out?  That smell when I go to cook it and stuff sometimes.  Like which one?  Chicken?  I still bat you.  Yeah, poultry.  Poultry?  Poultry can be pretty goddamn disgusting when it's raw.  It's gamey, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You get that smell sometimes.  Yeah, like it's a good or I don't know.  It's awesome.  I don't care, because once it starts fucking barbecuing, god damn nice shit.  How about bacon?  Do you like that smell?  Bacon?  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:00]  Well, she also grew up and she had to kill chickens.  She had to kill everything she ate.  Oh, right.  You know.  Is that real?  I've heard the stories over the years.  Yeah.  Yes.  Corey Starling?  Yeah.  You didn't kill the chicken.  You would let me know when your retarded husband stopped screaming.  She actually killed chickens.  How would you do that?  So you take the...  I don't even know if...  I don't know if I could do that.  Did you do the cut off the head thing?  Yes.  Or the grab the neck and flick it?  No.  You'd take a wire that was curved at the end and you'd go into the pen and you'd grab 
[01:19:30]  it and you'd get one of their legs and you'd pull it out and you'd just flip it onto  the board or onto the block and then you just had a little...  A little cleaver?  Kook.  And sometimes you didn't get it right away.  Or you got the wrong...  It's very quick, though.  Oh, man.  Did that ever bother you?  Then they'd run around.  They really would run around.  Did that bother you?  I don't remember that it really bothered me.  It was just such a part of like, this is what we do every spring.  They didn't have running water, so she only took a bath once a week and she had to share 
[01:20:00]  it with her sister.  Where the fuck did you live?  Their parents would bring in snow and melt snow and fill it.  And that's how she took a bath.  That's why, you know, like...  She's dirty.  We had like a potty in the...  Nice.  Yeah, I'm gross.  We had a potty in our house before we got running water that my father had to take and  empty out.  God, now I know why you're still with Rich Voss.  Yeah, no, I've...  I like roughing it.  How old were you when that changed? 
[01:20:30]  I guess it was about five or six when we got running water, but we always had a well.  And then, so that was...  You had to be very careful.  Wait, how far in the boonies were you?  Well, far...  You know, we were...  It's Cold Lake.  It's far.  I mean, now it's populated, but...  What's the closest area?  The North Pole.  So...  In Canada.  It's about as far north as people really do live.  In Canada.  In Canada.  I mean, until you get into the, like, you know...  Just crazy... 
[01:21:00]  The territories and stuff.  How bad were your winters and stuff?  Bad.  They must have been horrendous up that far.  Yes.  Very horrendous.  Why did you guys stay up there?  Well, we lived there for the reasons everyone lives places where everyone else goes.  That's just where your family was used to.  We were poor.  What are the territories?  What's that?  I don't...  They renamed them, and I don't know the names of them anymore, but...  But what is it?  It's above all the provinces?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's Canada.  It's Canada.  And how big is the territories?  Big.  They were massive.  Really? 
[01:21:30]  The territories.  Right after...  The territories is Antarctica, right?  Yeah, they just gave up.  They're like, we don't really need to name this shit.  Yeah.  It's Antarctica right after that.  Who lives in the territories?  India.  You're wrong, Rich.  Oh.  The Yukon?  Is that it?  Let's pull up a map.  Yeah.  Can we get a map up?  I want to see about where you lived.  Holy shit.  So about...  Are they still up there?  If you look at Alberta...  Right in front of you.  It's about halfway up the province on the east side of the...  Right on the Saskatchewan-Alberta border.  That doesn't mean anything to me.  I don't know where that is.  Yeah, I have no idea what that is.  I don't know the Canadian...  Oh, fuck, man. 
[01:22:00]  Can somebody come in and just find this for us on the...  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  So, I mean, when we go to her place...  So it goes British Columbia is on the far west...  Right, Vancouver and all that shit.  ...province.  And then the next province over is Alberta.  And then the next province over is Saskatchewan.  When we go to her family's house, we...  They're still up there.  Yeah, we fly into Edmonton and then drive four hours north of Edmonton.  Whoa.  And, like, they had a family reunion this year.  And, like, all the family comes in in RVs and stuff. 
[01:22:30]  Full screen.  What the fuck?  Look how old the map is.  Wow.  See, they didn't even update their map.  They just said...  Yeah, look at the Yukon up there.  Where do the provinces stop?  They're not called that anymore, I don't think.  Where do the Yukon is?  The territories, look.  See, that whole...  See, Alberta.  They're right on top of Alberta.  I see the Alberta right here.  Oh, territories do not cussed.  What a dumb-looking country.  None of you.  It looks like fucked-up America.  What's this up here?  It looks like a slam-bulled America.  It's retarded America.  What is this body up here with the red? 
[01:23:00]  The beginning of the eye?  It looks like America if you chopped off Texas and war.  I don't know.  They say they renamed them some...  Can we have a...  Can you find a map that's from the fucking 21st century?  Fuck, it's New England.  Fuck.  Chop the head off of New England.  Yeah, you chop that shit up.  Yeah, find a map post-World War II.  Wow, man.  I don't know what the territories are.  Well, now that you guys are swimming in money, maybe you should get your family out of there.  They would never leave.  They love it up there.  I love it.  What's there to do up there that's so cool?  Nothing.  No, I'm serious. 
[01:23:30]  They go hunting.  What is it?  They go fishing.  They go fishing, yeah.  Ice fishing?  Oh, God.  Yes, they do.  My mom and my dad, they love to go ice fishing, and they get a little tent.  It's like, you know...  There's something about it.  I want to...  I kind of checked it out a little bit.  I haven't officially done it.  Her father hates our comedy.  Oh, my God.  So my dad, a couple years ago when I was home for Christmas, Rich wasn't with us.  He said, I can't remember how we got into this conversation.  We're talking about comedy.  And then he said, I don't think Rich is funny. 
[01:24:00]  Wow.  Well, we did a show when we first started dating.  We did a fundraiser.  My sister is like the head of fetal alcohol or something.  So we went up there and did a...  For or against?  Yeah.  You should drink when you're pregnant.  Right?  Just wondering.  If you want to get on this show.  If you want to host this show.  Dude, your dad openly said he doesn't like Rich's comedy?  Well, they never liked Bonnie.  And they never liked yours?  Well, they don't really...  How about they shut their mouths?  They never ask questions about my stand-up.  They don't watch any of their specials or anything. 
[01:24:30]  They should shut their mouths.  I don't know these people, but what the fuck?  You don't have to be rah, rah, rah, but why don't you just shut up about it?  Well, he's an old farm guy.  You know, I mean, I'm doing hot jizz jokes.  You know, I could see why.  I signed with Bonnie's father on this one.  Are they religious?  No.  So it has...  They hate Catholics.  They're just simple, plain.  They probably...  What kind of comedy do they like?  Like Foxborough?  They probably like cleaner?  I don't know.  Yes.  Anytime.  It's...  How much does that bother you?  Because both of you guys, as much as we beat the shit out of you, are really funny. 
[01:25:00]  So how much does that bother you that they don't...  Daddy?  But how much does that bother you that they don't like it?  Well, it used to really bother me, but then at some point I felt like, oh, I can talk about  whatever I want.  I don't have to ever worry about them because they don't...  They've never Googled me.  They don't...  Did they watch you on TV?  No one else did.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  In fact, when I was on Letterman, they said that it was on too late.  Oh, my God.  It's Letterman.  A little show called Letterman.  What is that, though?  What do you think that is?  It's a late night show.  No, no, no. 
[01:25:30]  What is this weird?  I think...  I don't know.  I don't know.  My mom told me one time, she goes, you have to understand what you do is very remote.  And I was like, no, no, no.  Yeah, I know.  I was like, you guys are remote.  Speaking of remote.  Yeah.  So how did...  I got to ask you, how did you get out of that world?  It seems like it's a world that's tough to get out of, living that far north and people  are set in their ways and all of a sudden there's their daughter that wants to go to L.A.  and be a comic.  Well, she did in Canada first.  But is the rest of the family...  You were asking too many questions.  Is the rest of the family still there? 
[01:26:00]  Yes.  Oh, that's why.  They're all still there.  They represent you being gone.  You ever have to visit them, Rich?  Yeah.  And Rich, they actually like Rich.  I mean, aside...  So my father has never said I love you.  Ever.  To you.  To anybody...  That's what we have in common.  And here's the interesting thing.  Explains everything.  Is that he...  He's been on his deathbed like three times.  From what?  Well, he almost died of cancer.  He broke his back.  And then I can't remember what the... 
[01:26:30]  He had some operation or whatever.  Wow.  But it's been close where you think like you're standing at the bed like...  Here it is.  He believes like I won't fucking say it.  Like, you know, you're like...  Why won't he say it?  I don't know.  He comes from a different...  You know, that's...  What happens if someone says it to him?  He goes...  You know, if I talk to him on the phone, I'll say I love you, Dad.  And he'll be like, okay, okay, take care of yourself.  Take care of yourself.  Do you think he does and doesn't say it or that he doesn't at all?  He just doesn't. 
[01:27:00]  I don't know.  I think he does.  And my sisters will defend him.  They'll say, oh, he does.  I don't know.  You know that he does.  But the thing is, it's like I have a child now.  It's like, why would you do that?  Why would you not say to love you?  Parents are pretty fucking silly.  Do you like your dad?  I mean, you love him because he's your dad.  But I mean, do you like him?  Well, I really liked him growing up.  It's only when I got older and started sort of thinking...  Like, I spent a lot of time in the hospital as a kid and he never came to visit me.  They made her take the bus to the hospital.  For her first operation.  They were harvesting.  Okay.  Wait, what was the hospital?  She was eight years old.  Not eight. 
[01:27:30]  I was, I don't know, ten, I guess.  Ten.  But they didn't come visit you?  My mom did end up coming to visit on the weekend, but...  Wait, what was wrong with you again?  I had a lot of bladder, kidney issues.  Oh, right, right.  Oh, boy.  And wait, you had to go to the hospital by yourself?  Yes.  She had to take a bus?  I think it was ten.  That's mental illness.  That's crazy.  Oh, my God.  That's Asperger's mental illness.  Wow.  That's what I say.  You put her on a bus and she had to go cross-catter. 
[01:28:00]  They were harvesting.  They were harvesting.  It's like a hard family.  It's a hard family.  They would just put you on a bus and go, all right, good luck to you later.  Long angles.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Bring that spleen back.  I don't want to talk about this anymore.  I need to ask the next question.  I might have to go to the therapy.  How scared were you on a bus as ten?  I don't remember being scared.  I remember being like, this is an adventure.  In fact, I remember the next time I went to go, my mom was saying that you have to go  back because I got some kind of a transplant.  I can't remember what it's called, but it's...  Were they there for the transplant?  I don't know. 
[01:28:30]  I can't remember if they came for the actual operation or not.  Oh, man.  But I know I was in the hospital for long periods of time by myself.  Oh, man.  You are just...  Wow, that's terrible.  I will never...  The tube that goes from your kidney to your bladder, I had to get replaced on one side.  And then I had to go back the next year or two years later and get the other one replaced.  And I remember I was doing dishes with my mom and she was telling me about it.  And she looked at me and she goes, you seem like you're excited.  And I kind of was because it was like, you know, the nurses were really nice to me. 
[01:29:00]  They thought it was funny.  I got to watch television.  Wow, television.  Like, I was willing to go through, you know, some serious pain.  Do you have your original kidneys?  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  You now understand why she found somebody incapable of showing emotion.  Right, right.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You're her father.  And probably age-wise as well.  You do not know how to show emotion.  Like, that's why the hug, the awkward, stiff hugs. 
[01:29:30]  Yes.  But at least they're hugs.  How many times have you said that to yourself?  At least it's a hug.  Oh, wow.  I think your parents could be arrested.  Yeah, yeah.  That's terrible.  You're sending a 10-year-old on a bus?  I can't even wrap my head around this.  It's funny because when I told her, I didn't even think anything of it.  Dude, I had some fucked up shit happen to me growing up.  You know what?  You made my life way better today.  That's some pretty fucking shit.  You made my life way better today.  I'm not going to bitch as much.  Holy fuck.  That's mental illness.  That's sick.  That's complete prejudice.  And my mom has mental illness, but wow, that's fucked up. 
[01:30:00]  She was there when we had colds and shit.  They're very, you know, they had a lot of bad things happen in, you know, as...  They're farmers.  Like what?  They're farmers.  Well, they...  They're old school farmers, man.  Yes, I mean, they had to...  They got married and then they moved to this patch of, you know, unbroken farmland and they  had to, you know...  You ever watch those old farm shows and stuff and shows from the 1800s and stuff?  I lived in the 1800s.  And it's like, they just... 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, the 1800s.  And when their kids...  Their kids would die and they wouldn't even care because it was like kind of expected.  They'd just have more and shit.  Like you were that kid that like, if you just died on that bus, they'd be like, oh, well.  You're an old school.  What less...  Yes, yes.  Is that how they survived, do you think?  By having that mentality?  It's the only way you can survive in that fucking hard environment?  You have to kind of develop some kind of, you know, shield to the...  First of all, to the elements themselves.  I mean, you know, it's cold.  You know, they lived in a house trailer with three kids. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, God.  You know, before I was born, that was like very, very cold, you know, while they were  still trying to get the farm up and running and stuff and...  How many kids all together?  So four...  Just had kids for the heat.  Just for the fucking heat they throw up.  Like the matrix.  A lot of farmers had kids just, you know, so they could work the field.  For work, yeah.  Right.  You should ask your father who in his life died that depressed him so much that he didn't  want to say, I love you anymore.  That's probably what happened.  Well, his father died when he was four years old. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  We...  The last time...  Maybe that's...  We went back there...  Thanks for having me.  Oh, my God.  The bus story's beyond...  In the summer, we went back and there was a family reunion.  Yeah.  And these people came from all over Canada in RVs.  And we had to do a talent show on the back porch for the family.  Okay.  First of all, let me finish the father story.  So my dad said he didn't like Rich.  And so I got really mad.  And I said, you know what?  You don't have to say it.  If you...  You know, because they like to believe that their opinion is fact.  Just telling the truth. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, yeah.  No one needs to hear your dumb truth.  No, you just keep that to yourself.  I didn't...  I had an aunt like that.  I fucking openly hated her.  I'm like, all right, whatever.  This is how I make my living and help my family, which you're technically part of.  So shut your trap.  Right.  You know, keep it to yourself.  She hated that I was a radio guy.  Fucking hated it.  Had to tell everybody in the family.  Why would she hate that?  Huh?  Why did I hate that?  Have you ever listened to this show?  Well, why did she hate that?  Oh, oh.  Oh, because it's...  Oh, you want me to break it down?  I'll tell you why.  Because I come from a really big family. 
[01:32:30]  And she thought she was like the star of the family.  Oh.  And loved to gossip about everyone.  Like she would gossip about, you know, Rich, but then would be Rich's friend.  So she could gossip about you.  One of those fucking people.  Oh, right.  She's a cunt.  Right.  And when I, you know, when you're...  Nadia spelled that.  Not blood related, by the way.  And I like to mention that.  And when you're in the public eye and you come around family gatherings, and we all know this.  You know, people are like, wow, you got a cool job. 
[01:33:00]  So they kind of gravitate toward you.  And it took attention away from her.  But I always downplayed it.  Right.  I really did.  But it drove her fucking nuts.  So she tried to break me down and, you know.  Did you ever have it out with her?  All the fucking time, man.  Really?  You just told her, go fuck your...  Not like that, I mean.  All the fucking time.  I left parties.  One time, I was growing my hair out.  This was years ago.  She goes, oh, with all the money you make, you would think you would have a nice haircut. 
[01:33:30]  In front of everybody.  I threw my fucking barbecue down in front of my dad.  It bummed him out.  I feel bad to this day because my dad's no longer around.  And I go, I'm fucking out of here.  That's all I need.  And I just left.  I'm like, I'm not dealing with this shit.  Well, and her husband was related to your family.  My dad's brother, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Did he ever get in the middle?  No, he just let this broad fucking run his life.  Was it his first wife?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was a piece of work.  Yeah, lady.  She was a piece of fucking work. 
[01:34:00]  You know?  And I never told anyone how much money I made.  So, you know, she was obsessed with that, too.  I never told anyone in my family.  No one knows how much money I make, obviously.  Look how I'm fucking dressed.  No one knows.  Yeah.  But she had to make it a point to tell everyone, oh, with the amount of money you make.  Like, I didn't even say hi to her yet.  Right.  That was her hi.  But anyway, back to, I can relate a little bit is what I'm saying.  Yeah.  So, you told your father, like, don't...  Yeah.  So, I said, I go, you don't have to say anything.  I go, it's just rude. 
[01:34:30]  And it was a free show we did.  Anyway, yeah, we did.  It was a benefit for my sister.  Did he say this beforehand or after?  This was years after the benefit.  I would imagine, sorry to interrupt again, but I just want to bring it all together.  I imagine people were really enjoying the show.  They loved, I mean...  Obviously.  Yeah.  Killed, right?  Killed.  Yeah.  People were very...  And in fact, that got...  That was the first year that she did the fundraiser and it just got bigger and bigger until she  started using...  She was my sister who runs it.  She was like...  She decided she could just use any comic she wanted. 
[01:35:00]  You know, she didn't have to pay for somebody fantastic.  And so then it started to...  Yeah.  And then she asked us to do it again.  But I think maybe her father didn't like me because at our wedding, when everybody went  up and talked, I go, you know, I go and then I met Bonnie's family and then her father  touched me in the garage, I think.  Can I say that at the wedding?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  In the barn.  A lot of people jumped over to Carl's side. 
[01:35:30]  You blew it, Rich.  So what happened when you said it to me?  So I went downstairs, went to bed and the next day he, you know, my sister, through  my sister, she said, he didn't mean it like that, you know, but he didn't apologize or  anything.  So when Rich did the...  When we went back for the family reunion last summer, they wanted us to do a show on the...  A talent show.  Host a talent show.  With all the kids and stuff.  Oh, sure.  Sure.  So I didn't want to do it, but we did it anyway.  And Rich was really funny.  You were really funny.  I was like, I just stood there like a, like your sidekick hyena. 
[01:36:00]  We were on the back porch and we were all sitting in lawn chairs.  But you had to perform for your own family?  Yeah.  I mean, it was...  That's gotta be weird too, right?  There's like a hundred people there.  There's like a hundred people.  Yeah, it was really awkward.  You're a crazy person.  How do you do that?  I would never be able to do that.  But you can't...  Oh my God.  Can you imagine...  But if you said no, they would think you're being an asshole.  Who cares?  They didn't take you to the hospital.  Yeah.  Right. 
[01:36:30]  Why'd you say you want a show?  Get on a bus and go to a...  You're like Ratso Rizzo.  Exactly.  He just took a rest stop.  Wasn't on the schedule.  I just want my kidney replaced.  And as a mom, can you imagine putting Raina on a bus for a fucking...  Oh my God.  I can't even...  So how did this show go?  Did your father stone face him?  He did great.  And then afterwards...  And this is all...  We just kept doing this to my dad.  I'd say, wasn't he great?  Wasn't he great?  Oh no. 
[01:37:00]  I mean, it was old...  And I guess he got really mad too that night.  My mom said he was in a bad mood.  Well, there was old people.  I mean, there were some people in their 80s, you know.  I'm doing crowd work and just whatever.  And then we bring up little kids and they do a dance and stuff.  But I think they really started disliking us when we were...  Asked them for directions.  Oh, one time we were trying to get directions back to the airport.  So it's like a four hour drive.  And they were like...  They wouldn't give us any road names or anything.  They would just be like... 
[01:37:30]  Then there's a stop sign that's down.  And you turn there.  And, you know...  So we start making up directions.  And we're killing ourselves laughing.  And I look over at my mom and my dad.  And they're like this.  Stone face.  You turn at the barber pole?  Yeah.  Then there's a bridge that is obviously out.  And you're going to want to...  They're not fun folks, are they?  They think...  Yeah.  Where do you get your sense of humor from then?  A long lost relative.  I guess I'm... 
[01:38:00]  Someone on that bus.  I'm like a Jew.  I've been persecuted.  Anyone else funny in your family?  I get...  They're funny.  You know, they're...  You should show your sister shit.  That sounds hilarious.  I do have a sister who has Down syndrome who is...  And a husband.  That's to see people think I married my father.  Actually.  I did have a therapist one time that said you're trying to recreate not just one relationship  that you grew up with, but all of them.  All of them.  All of them. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, wow.  So he does fit a lot of...  Yeah, he fits the bill.  Wow.  You're just like, my mom nags me to death.  I want you to lick her ass.  You know, quicker.  That's funny.  Wow, Bonnie has a hell of a story.  Yeah, it's really interesting.  Oh, man.  Right?  That's fucked up shit right there.  She's getting a book deal.  You're a lifetime movie.  Oh, that's great.  You are a lifetime fucking movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's...  Totally, man.  I got out.  The Bonnie McFarlane Story, starring Markie Post, as the bus driver who cared. 
[01:39:00]  Where you going, little girl?  Let's try me off at any hospital.  The guy from that retarded show as her husband.  Life goes on.  Quirky.  So, who are you writing a book for, Oliver Twist?  Well, he's jumped again. 
[01:39:30]  I haven't actually got the book deal, but I had a meeting with some people.  He should.  That'd probably be fascinating.  That's amazing shit.  It's great.  Oh, all that early shit is fucking killer.  God, fucking Canada's just weirdos.  And I'm not talking the Canada near us, because that's kind of US.  By the way, those operations were free.  Oh, right.  I had to pay for the bus, but the operations...  How long was the bus ride again?  I don't know.  Do a picture of your dad.  I met your family.  No, I don't.  Did I meet them at the wedding?  Yes, they love you. 
[01:40:00]  They love you.  I think that they love you more than Rich.  No.  If you had to pick a celebrity that your dad kind of resembled, who would you pick?  Just so we could get a little...  Like growing up or now that he's...  Well, growing up and now.  Both, yeah.  Let's see.  Oh, there is an actor that I...  Jesus, now I can't remember his name.  Oh, brother.  This is going to be bad.  Usually, if you just go, he was in, and then I'll be like, oh, that guy.  I watch too much.  Midnight Run.  Yafit Koto. 
[01:40:30]  Just start naming people.  Mazden.  Mazden.  Mazden.  Mazden.  Madden?  No.  Is there an actor?  Michael Madden?  Michael Madden.  Michael Madsen.  Madsen.  Michael Madsen?  No.  I don't know.  I like Michael Madsen.  Yes, when he was younger, yeah.  And just as stable as Michael Madsen.  Exactly.  Did he ever talk into your severed ear?  He hasn't been on the show in a while.  Is his sister an actress, Michael Madsen?  Yeah, Virginia.  Yeah, Virginia fucking won an Oscar.  Won an Oscar.  Yeah, she did. 
[01:41:00]  I don't know what she looks like.  I know I know her, but I can't see her.  People say I actually look like her.  Is he in medicine?  Not at all.  Okay.  Yeah.  No, I'm just kidding.  And her sister, I mean, Andrea's cool.  Like, when we go visit...  Andrea's a delight.  Andrea and her husband are cool.  They still live up in that era?  Your other sister, her husband's cool.  Uh, the kid was making fun of me.  I think, see, we did a podcast and kind of smashed her sister.  Well, yes.  Okay.  Oh, this is the thing.  So they've never listened to anything I've ever done.  So we do a podcast where we talk about my sister and her charity and how she, you know, 
[01:41:30]  she's the head of a charity, but she's got a big house and, you know, she makes a lot  of money, but she acts like she's Mother Teresa, you know, she wants everyone to do free  stuff for her.  And so we were talking about that on our podcast and she emails me a podcast, Bonnie, and I  was like, I couldn't figure out, is she asking, should she do one?  I didn't know at first.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:42:00]  And then, yeah.  So she heard that podcast.  I don't know why or how.  Was she wicked pissed?  Yes.  She won't talk to me.  She still won't talk to you.  Well, kind of.  Now she will...  How long ago was it?  A year ago.  It's like our third podcast.  Yeah.  Did you apologize to her?  I said, I go, I talk about my life a lot in my art and I'm sorry you got dragged into  it.  I meant it to be humorous.  Right.  Right.  I can't say I don't, you know, I can't take it back completely because it's...  Sure.  We'd be like, oh, I didn't mean for you to hear.  I didn't mean, yeah.  I'm sorry you heard that. 
[01:42:30]  That's the apology.  That means she listens to all your shit.  She just doesn't tell you.  I think what's going to happen is that somebody in that town heard, you know, we do have fans  that span two continents.  The cab driver listens to Opie and Anthony, the one cab driver up there.  Yeah.  Remember?  The one cab driver up there.  No, no.  That was when she was touring.  She was in one of the territories.  She was in like way...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because she's like fetal alcohol.  I mean, she goes to...  Wait, what kind of people live in the territories?  Like how far north of you can you drive? 
[01:43:00]  Aren't they like the Indian versions of like American Indians, but it's the Canadian Indian  versions of people that live up there?  Yes.  Are they like Eskimos?  They're...  Oh, you want to hear...  I don't know.  I really don't know.  They're Aborigines.  They're just the indigenous population of Canada.  Do you know Canada, like even the fucking Canadian pavilion in Epcot stinks.  It's not even exciting at Disney.  It's terrible.  You're trashing our country.  Oh, fuck that country.  She was rooting for him during the Olympics. 
[01:43:30]  It's not that northern Canadian shit.  Like southern Canada, that's pretty cool because it's very kind of the same.  Toronto, Montreal.  Right.  Montreal.  Montreal.  Vancouver.  When we were in Edmonton doing a show, he sees this table of Asian people and air quotes  and he starts making Asian jokes and everyone's laughing and everyone in the audience knows  that he's mistaken Indian people, you know, natives for Asians. 
[01:44:00]  And yeah, he's just doing these like, you know, stereotypical...  So they were Indians?  They were, yeah, Canadian Indians.  And he thought they were Asian because they kind of have that Asian kind of face.  Yes, in the start.  It was a mongrel look, yeah.  Because they came over across the land bridge.  Yes, yep.  Yes, from Alaska over the Straits and fucking when everything was frozen.  I wish I knew they were Indians.  I wish I knew they were Indians.  I would have had that on material.  Their little eyes kind of look Asian.  You're not supposed to say Indians.  It's...  No, what's the political correct term for... 
[01:44:30]  I think they call those people Aborigines.  Really?  I thought that was like Australia only had those.  I know, because we got to call them like American...  Not American Indian, but Native Americans.  Native Americans.  If you call them Indians, they freak out.  But then when you call blacks Native Americans, they get mad.  So what do you...  Oh, boy.  You know what I mean?  Indians hate when you look at them and go, hey, I...  Are you all...  Are you all...  Dot dot com.  We have to take a break.  Brian Regan's here.  Oh, yeah.  Brian.  So, the movie. 
[01:45:00]  Wow.  Oh, man.  I learned a lot about Bonnie today.  Fucking fast.  None of that's in the movie.  This Saturday at 1 o'clock.  Next weekend, I'm at Bananas in Poughkeepsie, too.  Very cool.  Yeah, the movie, though, tomorrow at Caroline's.  It's open to the public, right?  1 o'clock tomorrow at Caroline's.  You can see Women Aren't Funny.  Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane.  The movie's great.  It really is.  The sounds...  You know, here's the thing.  We're not getting kicked out, are we?  No.  Okay, because that's the way it always sounds when you're doing radio.  Shut up. 
[01:45:30]  Okay.  You can move over to where Bonnie is, though.  Give the seat to Brian Regan.  Okay.  Or just...  It's one of my favorites.  Or beat it.  Well, put a mic up.  Or beat it.  I'm not beating it.  Or you could sleep in your car for a couple hours to save on the parking.  You'd never disappoint.  And the podcast, of course, still going strong.  My wife hates me, yeah.  How do they see that or hear that?  Oh, iTunes or Riotcast.com.  There's even a Riotcast app.  And there's a lot of podcasts.  Bobby's is on it. 
[01:46:00]  Florentine.  Just promote yours.  Oh.  What's wrong with you?  I'm a team player.  They'll promote their own.  My wife hates me.  Don't be a team player.  You're desperate for money right now.  And my CD is still empty inside.  It's up for a Grammy.  So, still empty inside.  On iTunes.  All right.  We're going to continue with Brian Regan.  Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane, everyone.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Channel.  On SiriusXZone.  In a world where one vigilante engineer disregards the law of the land. 
[01:46:30]  Fuck you and your rules.  Only the strong will survive.  I'm a much bigger man than you are.  Marcelino Centeno is.  We're going to fight.  Live wire.  I'm not afraid of your information.  Engineer or no engineer.  Live wire looks to take down the bad guys at any cost.  You have a difficult personality and you're an asshole.  But you're our engineer.  You could drop dead right now.  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Whining and complaining get you nowhere with live wire.  I'm still waiting for a Christmas dinner from five years ago. 
[01:47:00]  That's exactly my point, you stupid fuck.  Little dick motherfucker couldn't even get it hard.  No action adventure will get your blood boiling like this.  Strap in, folks.

I was crying a lot in the theater when I seen that one.  I couldn't see through my tears.  I had such a big lump in my sweatpants. 
[01:48:00]  I love that movie.  Look at that.  You're all rough.  You got leaves on you.  Come here.  Let me muss your hair up.  Come here, Macaulay.  Look at your denim coat.  I cried so hard.

Plenty of tickets available in the Dallas Improv in Addison.  Brian.  Hello.  Brian.  Hi, Brian.  Hi, Brian.  How are you, sir?  All right.  Oh, this microphone situation is stupid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give him the better mic.  We're trying to get a table mic, but apparently nobody in this fucking building knows where  our table mic is, which we had today.  We're trying to get a table mic. 
[01:51:00]  I like this like this.  What's up, Brian?  Brian Regan.  All right.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  When was the last time you were here?  It was a while ago, man.  I don't know.  It was a while ago.  Was it a year?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But it's been a little while.  It's always good to be back, man.  Yes.  You guys are good human beings.  Is that Mike bugging you, Brian?  No, we're terrible.  The way it's falling down?  We're terrible human beings.  Oh, you're terrible human beings.  We're awful human beings.  I had it wrong then.  I'm sorry.  You guys are terrible human beings. 
[01:51:30]  Your awfulness.  I was thinking of somebody else.  Where's Brian going to be?  Because I have not seen Brian in a while.  I would love to see Brian.  And I would love to fucking see Brian.  You know what I like doing?  I like taking people to see Brian.  Because they fucking, they laugh hysterically.  And you're like a hero.  Like, that guy was fucking hilarious.  And you're just kind of sitting there.  Like, yeah.  Very kind.  You do all the work and I look like a fucking hero.  Yes.  Oh, he's playing a little place called the Beacon Theater.  Oh, that's quaint. 
[01:52:00]  Tonight, right?  It's an acoustic show.  You didn't bring the whole band with you?  No, no.  It's just me.  Just you and a ukulele.  You can unplug.  I like it.  A little place called the Beacon Theater.  Fuck, that's awesome.  The New York Comedy Festival deal.  Yeah.  You talked about it last time.  I'm just going to ask this.  How's things going?  Things are good.  Personally.  Good.  Okay.  Things are really good.  I don't know how much you want to say, but you kind of like let it out a little bit last  time you were here. 
[01:52:30]  You were going through a separation, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, that separation became successful.  Okay.  It was a successful separation.  I don't know.  I don't know how to like, you know, I don't know if he wants to talk about it, but I know  you did a little bit last time, so I want to see how everything's all right.  Everything is a-okay.  All right.  You know?  Life is wonderful.  It really is.  Everyone's just moving on.  I really want to talk about it.  I want to find out, like, what the, like, I mean, I hate my husband, but we're never 
[01:53:00]  going to get divorced.  Oh, guess again.  Oh.  Brian, you're in the middle of these, too.  Oh, man.  How fun with that?  Well, see, now, hating the husband is a sign that it's not going to work out, right?  Isn't that like a clear sign?  Yeah, that's usually-  You would think.  That's what somebody with a C-  It's a red flag.  You're going to work around the hatred part.  All right.  Yeah.  It's either stay married to him or start cutting myself. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, that's good.  Might become a cutter.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  A cutter.  But you still living in Vegas?  Yes.  Oh, how's that?  You like that still?  I hear the economy is really kind of shitty in Vegas.  Yeah, but I'm rich as shit.  This is a new Brian.  Regan.  That doesn't bother me.  There's a lot of people hurting out there, but I'm doing great.  You ain't one of them.  This is the new Brian.  Wow.  I got that girl, and I licked her boxing. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, my God.  I think it's the first time you ever cursed on our show.  Did I curse?  Nah, nah, nah.  You might have.  You said the S word.  You might have.  Say you're rich as shit, man.  You're allowed to.  You're allowed to hear.  Bleep that out.  It will bleep that out.  Yeah, this is taped, right?  Yeah, yeah.  This is family entertainment.  For future broadcasts.  Brian Regan is family entertainment.  He's rolling over in his apartment.  Oh, man.  Were you able to, you know, were you able to retain your house, or did you have to get  another house?  I know you're rich, but that never comes in. 
[01:54:30]  That's never a fun thing.  Brian.  Sorry.  Your pal Anthony's been through this one.  Okay.  And it's not a fun thing.  Right.  Did you get to, did you have to leave everything that you owned?  Yeah, we just got rid of the house and started separate situations.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  I was just wondering.  I don't mean to pry.  I'm a start fresh kind of person.  That's good, right?  Yeah.  I don't want to bring furniture from the pre, you know, I just want to clean, clean sleep. 
[01:55:00]  Look, Jim's on TV.  Oh, too bad.  You guys just didn't see it.  No, we missed it.  I saw that, and it looked a lot like me.  I saw the same thing.  That is good.  Like, just start fresh.  You don't want any, like, old fucking memory things, or, you know, if the couch cushion  smells like her, get it out of here.  No, no, no.  Nothing negative.  It's all good.  All right.  Good.  And it seems like...  I was talking about me, myself.  I did the same thing.  But...  I just, like, didn't want any...  But the point is, you went years.  It seems like this was quick for Brian.  I hope so.  And it went through... 
[01:55:30]  How many years was it in the end?  Three years.  Three years.  You were married three years?  No, no.  No, no, no.  I was married nine years.  The divorce took three years.  And I had to pay her for a total of nine years.  It was horrible.  Wait, you only had to pay her for six years, you're saying?  No.  I had to pay her during the divorce for three years.  And then an additional six years.  He just did a quick subtraction.  Oh, did he?  Nine minus three. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you mean you had to pay her for nine years?  A total of nine years.  From the time I started...  We started the divorce proceedings.  I had to pay her support.  Oh, okay.  And then I had to pay her the settlement thing that we came across.  And it was, you know, a lot of money.  And, in fact, for a total of nine years of paying her for nine years!  And you're done.  When were you done?  And Rich goes, and you're done.  And you're done.  Do you understand what he's trying to say?  It was a nightmare.  I was done in...  It went on way too long.  Not too long ago.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was like... 
[01:56:30]  Only a couple years at this point.  Rich, if you understand, close your mouth.  I think it was 2008 or 2009.  Wow.  It was terrible.  That's when it starts?  Or that's when...  No, that's when I stopped paying.  Oh, yeah.  That was the end of the year.  That's when the last payment...  I actually jabbed her on the last payment, too.  It's like, what's she going to do?  What's she going to do?  So I took a couple of bucks off.  Literally two dollars.  Really showed her.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Did you write in the memo, payment in full?  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  Paid in full.  Thank you.  So how long have you actually been split now and you're on your own?  Two years.  Oh, it's a while.  Okay, go on.  All right.  Wow, this is so uncomfortable.  He doesn't want to talk about...  Brian is...  That's not a bad...  Brian Regan.  Brian Regan, is there a young lady in your life?  I love how he talks about a young lady.  Oh, yeah.  You feel like he doesn't want to talk about it?  Well, I mean, he's one of the funniest guys on the planet. 
[01:57:30]  Right.  You bring up the most depressing stuff.  We've been friends.  Hey, Brian, anybody you know?  We've known him forever.  So we want to make sure...  All I wanted to make sure he's doing all right.  I take it in a good way.  It's what we do here.  We just talk to each other.  What the fuck?  What would you like, Rich?  So, Brian, tell us about the plain ones.  Oh.  He's our friend.  We want to know him.  We could talk about Pop-Tarts or something if you want.  How else do I feel better about myself?  Because Brian is doing the beacon and I'm not.  How else do I feel better about myself?  I find out that he has personal problems just like I have. 
[01:58:00]  Through other people's misery at some point.  I gain confidence.  That's how we feel better about ourselves.  Nice.  It's human nature.  It is.  It's a microcosm of the actual world in here right now.  So, we are pecking away, trying to get someone's misery so we can go, ah, I feel so much better  about me.  So, why don't you guys just drive through Staten Island and go, oh, at least I'm not living  like that.  That's what I'm saying.  You could have just said drive through Staten Island.  We understood what you meant.  We got to act out what we would say.  Brian, we had a super storm hit the Northeast. 
[01:58:30]  I don't know if you know.  Oh, man.  Big, huge super storm.  And it doesn't matter.  Oh, you're too rich to know.  Yeah.  I'm about power.  I've been enjoying champagne.  No, of course I heard.  So, you know, I have to say the obligatory, my thoughts and prayers go out to those affected.  A champagne cork scuffed my wall, so I understand having to bring in somebody to repair things  in a house.  I relate completely.  Yes, indeed. 
[01:59:00]  And it's been without power for 11 days.  I'm going on 11 days, no power.  And the gas situation in New York is crazy.  You can't get gasoline.  What's going on with the crane?  That was the big thing on the news for people who weren't in New York.  It was the hanging, dangling crane thing.  Well, young Daniel-san used it against Cobra Kai.  Don't look at me like that, Jimmy.  Why?  I'm ashamed of you.  They strapped down the crane, Brian.  The crane is strapped?  Yeah, it's all strapped down. 
[01:59:30]  It's probably like old news.  It looks like it's been taken care of for seven days and I'm bringing it up.  It looked like a limp dick for a few days there.  It was swinging in the breeze, as they say.  It was just kind of swinging in the breeze.  Swinging in the breeze.  I drove by a construction site and saw a crane with a sign on it that said 24-hour crane  service.  And I'm like, you know, who's going to need a crane like at 3 o'clock in the morning?  You know, is the guy going to wake up?  Ah!  I've got to build a skyscraper! 
[02:00:00]  Honey!  Where's the crane number?  Remember we wrote it down?  Just in case?  It's got to be up by sunrise!  I don't understand the selling point.  The 24-hour crane.  I have a feeling he wanted us to ask him about cranes.  Maybe, but that's our crane.  I think he had to set up his own joke. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, I set up my own joke.  That's not fun.  Hey, let me ask you.  He doesn't give a fuck about the crane.  The hurricane, did it affect any of the donut shops around here?  Well, matter of fact, it did.  Why would you ask such a question, Brian?  Yeah, you know, I was thinking, because I was in one, right?  No, I'm not doing it.  Of course not.  No, I'm not doing it.  You're still touring all over the country, huh?  Yeah.  I don't see you back here in New York as much, though.  Well, I miss New York a lot. 
[02:01:00]  I do the comedy festival every two years, but I'd like to come more often than that.  Yes.  I miss you guys.  Of course it doesn't.  You don't come around this way anymore.  It's just because I'm not performing here.  That's the only reason.  That's why I want to perform here.  Last time you came through, you weren't here.  You were doing other gigs, but you came through.  You were here for something else, I think.  Letterman, I think it was.  You might have been.  Oh.  Oh.  Any Lettermans or anything this time around?  Not this time around.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  The fuck's wrong with Dave?  Yeah, fuck Letterman.  Come on, man.  Oh, no!  Well, if he's not fucking Brian Reagan. 
[02:01:30]  How many of you guys?  We love him.  We love the guy.  How many Lettermans have you guys?  Fuck him now.  Did the 25th.  Wow.  Give the fuck, you did 25?  That's a lot.  Damn.  A couple months ago.  That's awesome.  This show's on very late at night.  It is.  Bonnie's father said that to Bonnie once when she was on.  Really?  He didn't watch because it was on really late.  That's too funny.  It was on really late at night.  Yeah.  It's so bad to do to it.  Look at Brian.  He loves it.  It's so bad to do to your daughter.  I relate to that completely. 
[02:02:00]  I see.  Yeah?  I relate to when you try to tell people that you're going to be on something and they'll  tell you that they don't want to stay up.  Oh, we go to bed at 11.  You go, well, damn.  What kind of friend are you?  Are you sure?  Yeah.  So who said that?  Your dad?  My dad, yeah.  Wow, that's funny.  No, it's not.  I heard that Robert Klein was trying to tell his mother that he was going to be on Letterman  and he's like, I don't know if we get that channel. 
[02:02:30]  I'm like, it's CBS.  You get it.  Trust me.  You get it.  Oh, my God.  They just don't know.  It's not as important to them as yourself.  They've got to harvest.  They had to harvest, Brian Regan.  They had to get up early to fucking harvest the fields.  That's right.  Do you deal when you're traveling around with people, you know, they get upset with you if  you don't tell them they're coming to town, that you're coming to town? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  And then.  But what are you going to do?  Like text everybody?  Right.  And then if you do tell them and they can't make it, then you feel like you're kind of  a jerk for throwing it out there.  So it's kind of a no-win situation.  Yeah.  If they can't, then they'd follow you on Twitter or follow your website if they gave a shit.  That's true.  Fuck them.  How come you didn't tell me you were coming to town?  Was that my job?  Yes.  I have a website. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Why are you responsible for that?  That's what I say to my mom and dad.  I got a website.  I want to take notes every once in a while.  You're at BrianRegan.com, mom and dad.  Tell you where I'm going to be.  Are you doing any stuff up there in Canada?  Up there?  Bonnie McFarlane's home country.  Cold Lake, Alberta.  Nothing soon.  No, huh?  It's way up there.  Jay Moore just did Cold Lake.  Did he?  Yeah.  He hated it.  Did he really?  He hated the area.  He liked the gig.  Yeah, he did. 
[02:04:00]  What's that?  It's a horrible place, according to Jay Moore.  First time I ever performed in Canada was in Winnipeg.  Yeah.  And the Winnipeg Jets were the NHL team.  I don't know if they still are.  But it was this nightclub that was going to have comedy.  And the Winnipeg Jets were in the hockey playoffs.  If I know anything about Canada, I know they like hockey.  Yes, they love it.  So I go in.  It's on their money.  All these TV screens are hanging with the Winnipeg Jets about to start a playoff hockey game. 
[02:04:30]  And the club owner comes up, all right, we're going to go ahead and pull the screens up and start the comedy show.  Oh, my God.  And I'm like, I want to live.  I want to live another day.  This is my first night in Canada.  Please, I cannot possibly trump hockey in Canada.  Wow.  That's a tough spot.  Yeah.  So what did he do?  He said these people, if they wanted to watch hockey, they wouldn't be here.  So he pulled the screens up.  Did they boo? 
[02:05:00]  No.  They didn't?  It was very bizarre.  Oh, Canada doesn't boo.  They might.  They'd crumble a little to themselves.  Oh, they're passive aggressive.  Oh, passive aggressive people.  Oh, my.  This is really terrible.  Remember the plane when they all were missing their cruise?  Yeah, we were trying to get out of Canada once.  Out of Edmonton.  Yeah, and the plane broke.  Yeah.  But all these people were there.  They were all flying to California to get a cruise.  I don't know why.  There were so many of them going on the same cruise. 
[02:05:30]  And they were going to miss their cruise.  Their one vacation.  And we were the only ones complaining.  Online.  And we just had to go nowhere.  We had nowhere to go.  Nothing to do.  What were they saying?  They were like, oh, well, it happened.  Really?  Oh, boy.  Better here than up there.  Exactly.  We were like the asshole American.  Rich was like, I heard it.  Break.  You've got to get us on another plane.  The tow bar or something broke. 
[02:06:00]  And I heard it.  And they go, well, it's beyond our control.  No, you guys had faulty equipment.  Don't fucking leave it.  Of course.  What airline was it?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  But I had to get back.  United, maybe.  You know, when you're in the back and they pull away from the gate, but then they're just  sitting there for a while.  And then increasingly you get that anxious feeling, especially if you have a connection.  And then the captain gets on with the folks.  Let me get you caught up on what's going on up here.  Now, you know that that's never going to be followed with anything good. 
[02:06:30]  Let me tell you what's going on up here, folks.  We found a big bag of money on board.  And the rules are that the money gets divvied equally amongst all the passengers.  And the reason for the delay is that the rubber bands we've been using are snapping on the size of these bundles.  So we apologize. 
[02:07:00]  Never that.  You know, a month or two months ago, and I think it was on a Tuesday.  Well, no, no, it was a Thursday.  It might have been a Thursday.  It could have been a Thursday.  The weather, I think it was mild, 64 degrees with partly cloudy skies.  He loves details in his stories, Brian.  It's funny.  But all the wrong details.  It's the wrong details.  So like if a chicken crossed a road story, a chicken, it was a Tuesday. 
[02:07:30]  A chicken started to cry.  No, wait, wait.  It was a Wednesday.  I think it was either a roaster or a Rhode Island Red or something.  His beak.  It was one with a thing under the neck.  No, see, that's too much about the chicken.  About the chicken, right, right.  He'd have to make it about himself.  The road itself, too, was more asphalt than concrete.  So, listen, a $300 pair of sunglasses was stolen out of my golf bag, right? 
[02:08:00]  So, the ones you told me to get, whatever.  Stop pointing to people who aren't listening to you.  Just tell the story.  Quit sitting like you're a headliner.  Oh, wow.  Oh, Brian, you're right in the middle of this?  Brutal.  Yeah.  Wow.  A light little jab.  But you should see.  Right cross after.  So.  At home, we're just hugging the entire time.  This is all an act. 
[02:08:30]  So, the sunglasses were stolen.  I put the claim.  They caught the people, the TSA people that were stealing them.  They caught them in North.  And they said, we don't cover sunglasses.  Well, they caught the fucking guy that was stealing the stuff.  Maybe.  They don't cover his stolen goods?  They don't cover so many.  There's a list of things they don't cover.  Well, he's a criminal.  He did something illegal.  You've got to take up a civil case with him.  Right.  For your sunglasses.  No, but if he works for the, you work for TSA.  For the airline.  Then you've got to sue the airline.  Just walk up to any black guy at the airport and be like, where's my sunglasses? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, shit.  I was.  And then they just give them to you.  Hey.  Oh, that would be great.  I was trying to get Anthony to like me.  Oh, it worked.  It worked.  McFarlane, it worked.  Fucking fantastic.  So, yeah.  You lost your sunglasses.  Yeah, but they caught the guy.  It was in the paint.  We heard the story.  Exactly.  How are you going to reiterate it?  We got it.  This is not just a mystery.  You understand what I'm saying?  Yes.  What's my recourse?  Yeah, we do.  And they also stole.  Fucking bullet to the head.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:09:30]  A $200.  Suicide will show them.  A golf harness.  They took my golf harness.  Oh, boy.  That stinks.  What's a golf harness?  It's a golf harness.  It's a thing you get.  It's a swing correction.  It's a swing thing, yeah.  What did they think it was when they stole it?  Because no way they were stealing a golf harness.  I don't fucking know.  I thought it was a holster.  When you threw it in the gray bin, the guy behind you, oh, my God, is that a golf harness?  Golf harness.  I'm going to get my hands on that thing.  Leave the laptop.  I need the golf harness. 
[02:10:00]  Jesus Christ, Rich.  Hey, we got Bond coming in today, by the way.  Roger Moore.  Yes.  Oh, Roger Moore will be in later.  What time?  9.15.  Yeah, I know we got plenty of time, but I see him on TV right now.  Wow, he looks all right.  He's in his 80s.  Egg whites.  50 years of Agent 007.  Couldn't eat an egg.  Fucking get the yolk with it.  Yeah.  Yolk is the whole flavor part.  I like his egg whites.  It's like, you want some Kool-Aid?  Yeah, and someone gives you water.  He goes, well, I left the Kool-Aid out.  You drink the Kool-Aid every time you go on, faux news. 
[02:10:30]  The yolk is the fucking part of the egg.  Everyone laughs at it.  It's great.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Canadian bacon is good.  Is that turkey bacon?  Turkey bacon.  Turkey bacon stinks.  I love turkey bacon.  No, just go all in.  I love turkey bacon.  But I enjoy turkey bacon more.  No.  I enjoy turkey.  No one enjoys more.  You feel like you're eating a relative. 
[02:11:00]  It's not any healthier.  No.  No?  No, no.  Turkey bacon is not any healthier than regular bacon.  I thought it was.  Brian is moderating this turkey bacon debate.  Isn't turkey better for you than fucking ham, though?  Yeah.  Brian hasn't been around in a while.  We do food segments now.  They stopped us from doing all that stuff.  Right, so we penciled in talking about bacon today.  Doing all that stuff.  So we just decided, let's talk some food, a little food break.  We're foodies.  I had, you know, I'm trying to, like, lose a couple pounds, right? 
[02:11:30]  You don't need to, man.  You look great.  You look terrific, Brian.  Doesn't he look great?  He looks great.  Doesn't he look great?  Come on, now.  I thought you lost something already.  All right.  Well, now, positive reinforcement here.  Time for Rich to show his abs.  You guys are sweet.  Would you like to see Rich's abs?  Abs.  Oh.  Yeah.  I was hoping to.  Yeah.  I thought you said ass.  Well, he'll show you that, too.  He loves doing this.  He loves doing this.  What is that? 
[02:12:00]  I love, though, that he has to go concave.  Why does he do that?  Yes, he hunches over every time he does it.  He's an asshole.  That's why.  I think Brian doesn't know what he just saw.  So is that a way to get abs is you bend over so much that the rolls look like abs?  Yes.  Hard as a rock, baby.  Yes.  It's never been described that way before.  By the way, he just said hard as a rock, baby.  For those of you out there, he touched his head.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  Rich, why do you do that?  First of all, you can do all the schlaffing and churping, but you're the one who's got 
[02:12:30]  to drive home with me.  You'll pay then.  Okay.  Oh, that's real nice.  I don't know what that means.  So Brian looks like he lost a few pounds and he wants to lose maybe a few more.  I'm trying to eat.  That drive home goes like Vanilla Skies.  Wow.  Do you guys get along?  Because it don't sound like it.  No.  I mean, like when you're just hanging out, life's good, right?  We don't talk.  No. 
[02:13:00]  No, we get along.  Brian's going to lose a few pounds, eh?  Oh, my God.  There's Roger Moore on Morning Joe.  Oh, boy.  That's what I said earlier.  I said he looked good.  So, yeah, Rich is actually just two years older than him.  Yeah.  He's in his 80s.  Wow.  That's good for 80s.  Are you kidding?  Double O 80.  He does.  Wow, those glasses are thick.  Brian is talking about losing a few pounds.  No, no.  What are you even doing?  Sorry, Brian.  Sorry.  Torturously long set up. 
[02:13:30]  That ain't going to fly.  I know better than to go for this now.  I want to know about it, though, because I'm trying to lose some way, too.  Yeah, so you guys are trying to lose some weight?  We're all trying, yeah.  I'm trying to lose some weight.  Are you, Brian?  Yeah.  So what do you even do?  Well, I have a friend who said it's about food combinations.  Have you heard about this?  Yeah.  Yes, I have.  I said you can eat whatever you want.  It's the combinations of how you put the food together.  She said, for example, you wouldn't want to eat steak and potatoes together, but you could 
[02:14:00]  have plankton and alfalfa sprigs.  It's just the combinations.  That's all it is.  It's the combinations of how you put the food together.  Like, for example, you wouldn't want to eat, like, spaghetti and meatballs to pick something  at random.  You wouldn't want those together, but you could have wheat, soy, and raisin skins. 
[02:14:30]  Not the whole raisin.  You take the skins and you steam them.  The combinations.  It's the combination.  Those second options don't sound good at all, though.  No, I like the first options.  There's a drop-off on the second option.  The second ones don't seem as tasty.  That was my feeling.  Yeah.  I like the first ones.  The first ones sounded tasty.  And those are the ones that she says no to.  That you've got to steer clear of.  Right.  Right.  Damn it.  Have you ever tried those Korean, what are they called, Rich? 
[02:15:00]  Kimchi?  No, they're...  Broads?  Seaweed.  Massages?  Exactly.  The DMZ.  They're devolved immediately.  Starving my population.  Korean what?  Seaweed.  Seaweed snacks.  They're so good.  What the fuck?  Get some in here right now.  No, they're so good.  Is there carbs in there?  They probably are good.  They're great. 
[02:15:30]  Have you had them?  No.  Are there carbs in there?  No.  Because it's seaweed.  Seaweed and snack.  Seaweed salad.  It's two things that don't go together.  That's a good combination.  If you're going to have a snack, have a snack.  You can have the seaweed and the snack.  Get them in here, man.  No.  They're addictive.  I bet you they're good.  Seaweed and peanut butter is delicious?  I made that up.  But I do like...  I like seaweed.  Why would you call it a snack?  Seaweed's the name of your dog.  It's really good.  So what...  A seaweed...  We're short for cuntweed.  How's the seaweed...  How's the seaweed... 
[02:16:00]  What is it?  Like a chip?  It's like a little paper thin...  It's pubic hair.  What's that?  It's very, very thin.  Like a little piece of very thin paper.  Green.  Oh, yeah.  What did you think it was, bro?  What did you ask?  How it comes and what form.  Somebody get some seaweed snacks.  What does it come like in a box like envelopes?  What is it?  Yeah, it comes in a little, like, square container.  Sounds awful.  Yeah.  Oh, they're good.  You just pull them out.  And you pull one out.  Are they soft or are they, like, hard?  They're crispy.  It's like eating a snack. 
[02:16:30]  It is a snack.  A seaweed envelope.  It's like eating a snack.  Oh, brother.  It's almost like eating something good.  Yeah.  No.  It's almost like a snack.  If you love really yummy things like chips and stuff...  What's that?  You're not going to like it.  You know what I think?  If you like stuff like chips...  What's that?  Have chips.  What's that?  Right, chip.  Chip thinks you're calling his name.  Chip Chipperson.  He gets very excited when he hears the word chip.  Don't you have an intern that we can send out for some seaweed snacks? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, can we get seaweed snacks?  I think I was going to buy them once, but I didn't...  I said they might be eating pretzels or something.  Yeah, don't shell out the 90 cents that they are to try them.  No, it was for health purposes.  I was afraid it would be like eating pretzels.  I'm trying to keep that.  How would seaweed snacks be anything but good for you?  I don't know.  Why don't you look at the side of the thing that it says?  Anything that's seaweed...  That's why they made it out of seaweed.  Because it's fucking...  It's not going to put any pounds on you. 
[02:17:30]  It's seaweed.  There's a lot of tension in the room, Brian.  Listen, if you want to have a fair test about the seaweed...  If you're going to get the seaweed things...  Yeah, we are.  You also have to get chocolate iced doughnuts.  Yes!  Yes!  And you have to do a taste test.  We need a control.  You don't just eat the one and go, hey, that's not bad.  Right.  You also eat the doughnut and go, which would you rather have?  Exactly.  You have to have the doughnut first.  Entenmann's chocolate doughnuts.  Get some of those.  Let's do this.  And then we'll do a taste test.  Brian has seaweed snacks. 
[02:18:00]  Brian is onto something.  You should at least do the same food group, though, like a chip or a pretzel.  No, we're doing it, Brian.  But there's nothing that compares to a seaweed.  It says seaweed snack, so a doughnut's a snack.  That's right.  Cookies a snack.  Right.  It's the same group, Bonnie.  I had no idea you'd get this angry.  I'm angry.  I've been angry since Tuesday.  Since Tuesday?  Since you were seven.  Oh, okay.  I meant when I was two. 
[02:18:30]  Tuesday.  Oh, you guys.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  All right.  We're going to get some seaweed snacks, then.  Yes, please.  I'm starving.  I am hungry.  I'll fucking eat them through my krill.  See?  If anybody watched any of those whale documentaries.  I thought that was hilarious.  It's a krill joke.  Let's get Roger Moore to eat seaweed snacks.  Yeah.  Against his will.  Let's hold the back of his head.  Force feed him seaweed.  They give you raging diarrhea, though.  That's the only drug. 
[02:19:00]  Do they really?  No, they don't.  Raging.  Well, there's a...  You actually just sold me on them.  I fucking love a good...  I love a good shit where I have to clean under the seat.  Oh, I feel so sorry.  I didn't shit unless I have to lift the seat and wipe it.  They should put that on the box.  Causes raging diarrhea.  Causes cleaning under the toilet seat raging diarrhea.  Do you love cleaning under the toilet seat?  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  That's great.  I wonder what process it goes through.  Because no one likes...  When you're in the ocean and you see seaweed, you're not like, oh, that's delicious.  You don't think like that's going to be good.  Yeah.  And when a trout swims by you in the stream, you don't go, oh, boy, I'd like to take a bite  out of that, too.  Not like that.  But you know it is delicious.  Well, when you see a potato in the ground...  I know.  That's delicious.  That's true.  I bet these fucking seaweed snacks suck.  I bet they suck.  See, when we get them, you're going to say they suck. 
[02:20:00]  No, I'll be honest.  I'll be honest.  You'll be honest?  Sure.  Yeah, we'll be honest.  You have to have five before you really get it.  Oh, God.  The first one is a little weird.  Really?  It's like scotch.  It's like scotch.  You know, you can't just...  Has anyone asked what they taste like yet?  What does it taste like?  What do they taste like?  They taste like salted paper.  What do they taste like, Rich?  I don't know.  Sounds great.  I think they're good.  What do they taste like?  Salted paper. 
[02:20:30]  More like papier-mâché.  Where do we find this shit?  It's a lighter paper.  Where do we find this?  Any of those stores that have a million things that have, you know...  They have to have at least a million things to choose to want to stock seaweed.  That's the million's choice.  999,999.  We're ready.  Only million item stores are going to carry them.  Is it on the sign for the store?  Do they advertise they have a million things in them?  Or do we have to ask every single person? 
[02:21:00]  Before I come in and look around, how many things are you going to fear?  If you don't have a million...  I've got to move on.  The flowers and the fruit outside.  They have everything, you know...  A bodega.  Huh?  Yeah, they call it...  A bodega.  A bodega.  A real deli.  Yeah, something like that.  Where's one at the end time?  Sam, are we on this or what?  Yes.  Oh, good.  Get some seaweed snacks.  He just woke Sam up.  He doesn't even know what you're doing.  Yes.  Whatever.  I like the roasted garlic seaweed snacks.  Oh, don't get the wasabi.  They're too hot.  Yeah, the wasabi's too hot. 
[02:21:30]  I love wasabi.  Oh, get a wasabi.  Get a wasabi.  Also, in addition to...  We only have Brian Regan for a few more minutes.  He's doing TV with...  What TV are you doing, Brian?  It's CBS.  Oh.  A little CBS action.  Do we get that?  You get it, Mike.  Yeah, we're too busy to watch that, Brian.  Others will, though.  What show are you doing on CBS?  It's actually a taping something for the CBS morning show or something.  No, Sunday morning.  Sunday morning?  That's a fucking huge show.  I TVO that I'm not even doing.  I watch it every week. 
[02:22:00]  We leave you this Sunday morning.  That's the We Leave You show.  The sounds of a brook in New Hampshire.  It's a babbling brook.  We leave you this Sunday morning with birds tweaking.  And it's just...  Chee, chee, chee, chee, chee.  It's a 90-minute show that they can do in 30 minutes.  30 minutes.  They do a very long, like, here's what's coming.  So it's a half-hour show in 90 minutes.  Yes.  Wow.  They show half of every story at the very beginning. 
[02:22:30]  Yes.  They show the whole show in the first two minutes.  We've got to wait an hour for the actual one you like.  We leave you this Sunday morning.  I watch every Sunday, Brian.  I really do.  Sights of crows flying.  And then it just goes on forever.  Yes.  Like, forever.  Because we don't have anything left.  Well, we've already done everything.  The sounds of a gang rape in Chicago.  What?  No, you don't leave us with that.  That's terrible. 
[02:23:00]  I prefer the birds flying.  I know.  I did, too.  And Brian doesn't like when they add birds to golf telecast.  He hates it.  No?  He fucking hates it.  I never heard about that.  So, Brian, who's interviewing you?  Do you know who you're talking about?  Now I'm interested.  It's more of just an on-camera thing.  I mean, it's not an interview.  Is it on TV?  What are you doing?  What's the story?  I just do a commentary about...  Oh, oh, you're...  Oh, that's great.  Louis C.K. did one.  Yes, I saw it.  Who's that?  What's the commentary on? 
[02:23:30]  Food.  Oh.  Oh, fantastic.  Oh, really?  Can you give us a little one line?  I already did.  Oh.  Food combinations.  I don't think you should do that.  Yes, you did.  Oh, man.  Well, I tried it out here, and now I know to edit that out.  You got anything on seaweed snacks, perhaps?  I'm just here stealing all this food stuff.  All this food material.  Yeah, you tune in to this whole thing about seaweed snacks.  Wait a second.  That was ours.  How long did you let that up?  It's two and a half minutes.  Oh, cool. 
[02:24:00]  That's awesome.  That's a great show.  I would love to do one of those things.  Well, come along.  I'm going to do it.  Oh.  How do I?  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  He's single.  That's how I pick up chicks.  Hey, you want to do a CBS morning segment?  That's cool.  Charles Osgood, right?  Is he the one that's doing it now?  I have no fucking idea.  Good old Charles Osgood in his bow tie.  It's so weird.  It's like the show is depressing to me. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, Brian will fucking buck it up.  No, that one isn't.  CBS Sunday morning.  They show those different weird suns in the corner when they go, I don't like those.  They're creepy.  I thought it was a religious show.  Did you?  It does.  It looks like a religious show.  It's perfect for Sunday mornings.  I'm up Sunday mornings.  It's too fuck Sunday mornings.  I hate Sunday mornings.  I hate Sunday mornings.  Hold on.  The one that's depressing is 60 minutes after the football game.  No, that's fine.  Fuck yeah.  You're all excited.  And then they have the most horrendous shit going on in the world.  I don't mean like that.  I mean, it's a Sunday.  It's like a fucking funeral home kind of depression. 
[02:25:00]  If I might.  Yes, yes.  Bonnie McFarlane.  It is Sunday morning, so they have a nice pace for Sunday morning.  You can go and get your bagel and not miss anything.  And you come back.  I got a nosh and I'm still watching.  I love those low pressure TV shows.  I love being out on the road in Des Moines, Iowa, and you put on the local channel, and  it's two old ladies talking about quilt making. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, you like that?  I love it.  Bring it way back.  Bring that throttle way back.  It's like way back.  And that's what I like about it.  It's like so underproduced, you know.  Two chairs, and they're both talking about, you know, their quilting bee coming up this  Thursday, and I'm like, I'm riveted, you know.  I don't like the whole Sunday morning thing.  There's like a glass table with a vase on it, giant, vast, empty studio, and he just  comes walking in from the side.  Hello.  I'll show a story about ragdolls and the woman that collects them. 
[02:26:00]  And it's like some inane story you wouldn't even give a flying fuck about on Monday through  Saturday.  You do realize this is the show Brian Regan's taping.  Oh, I know.  In ten minutes.  This is going to turn it around for me.  I like that.  But it's such a throwback.  It's like something out of the 70s.  Yes, yes.  Where they walk up like it's just the studio, a little fucking table, and the guy talking.  What time's it start? 
[02:26:30]  No fancy graphics.  Yeah, they always come back to him.  Like, he does the intro to each story.  You know, it's like they don't have any of that graphics package where it's like...  By the way, from the time it's on, I still consider it Saturday night.  What time is it on?  That might be part of the prior.  The late Saturday night show.  Yes.  I think it's like eight.  Is it eight?  Seven?  I think it's nine.  We TiVo it and watch it like on Thursday night.  Oh, wow.  That's crazy.  I think you could go back in time if you do that.  It's crazy. 
[02:27:00]  You can't TiVo that shit.  It's a big deal for Brian Regan.  Sunday morning.  When they walk from off camera, and then, like, when they do a thing, and then they  walk, where are they coming from, and where are they going to?  I never understood that.  Why did you do that?  It's like the show's starting.  Were you not on time?  You just got there.  You just got there?  What a fluke.  You found a parking space, and you just happened to walk on, right on, and action.  It's like amazing.  This guy always just makes it.  Just makes it.  He's fantastic. 
[02:27:30]  No, I don't like it.  And it's not depressing in a way.  I know what you're saying after football is 60 Minutes.  It's not that way, like all action, and then it's the mood of the show, the attitude,  even the color of it.  Oh, man.  60 Minutes is way worse.  That Folgers in your cup, red sunshine coming through the window commercial thing.  I hate that.  It looks like nuclear fucking bombs went off outside.  The best part of waking up.  It's like, ah! 
[02:28:00]  Ah!  But your energy's different.  I hate any of that morning shit.  You're still in Saturday night mode.  That's the problem.  Yeah, yeah.  The rest of us are waking up like fucking human beings.  Be quiet.  Wake mom and dad up.  He's been gone so long.  He's been gone so long.  The Folgers in your cup.  The best part of...  And then...  Fucking Hiroshima.  The fucking sun is out there.  His shadow is burnt on the floor.  I hate...  It's so overdone. 
[02:28:30]  I don't like mornings.  I really don't like mornings.  You picked a good job.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony morning show.  Yeah, I really am an idiot.  You're killing fucking Brian's excitement.  Oh, no, no, no.  Brian's the one that's going to...  Brian's very excited about this.  He spends it at the end every time.  But you'll make it good.  Brian's going to fucking make this where I'm like...  I hate Jews, but you...  No, I'm going to watch it and be like, 
[02:29:00]  no, this feels like Tuesday.  He doesn't even want to do it anymore.  I've already snuck a cancel text in.  No.  Is this your first one?  Or have you done them before?  No, it's my first time doing it.  Yeah.  It'll be fun.  Of course it was.  It'll be a show.  Oh, Brian.  Maybe you could add a bit of jocularity to this show.  On this Sunday morning?  How do you know how he's done?  Oh, I don't know.  Because you've watched it a lot.  Watched it so many times. 
[02:29:30]  Wow.  Who was the other guy that had broads all over the country?  Remember him?  Oh, yeah.  He was married to like a bunch of them?  Charles.  Charles Carral?  No.  Yeah.  It was Charles Carral?  Charles Carral.  Yeah, Charles Carral did a Sunday show.  He used to do it.  Not only a womanizer, this fucking guy had a whole other family.  In Montana, I think it was.  But he's a celebrity, right?  He's dead now.  Yeah.  Well, how could he get away with it?  He kept it quiet.  It was in Montana in the middle of nowhere.  He had his wife and everything.  And then he had this other broad and kids and everything in Montana. 
[02:30:00]  That's too much fucking stress.  He used to spend a lot of time like, I need to wind down in Montana.  Coming up to Montana, do some fishing.  Some fly fishing.  And now, the sounds of me having sex with my mistress on this Sunday morning.  Yeah, the guy would just fucking go to Montana and live with his other family.  How do you balance two marriages?  How do you balance two marriages?  Oh, man.  What the fuck?  Unbelievable.  People like me and Brian can't even keep one.  Oh, sorry, Brian. 
[02:30:30]  Now I'm in the mood to go tape my thing.  You've really blown up his spot.  Oh, no.  It's all good, man.  Brian knows I fucking love him.  We went out one night.  I drank fucking tequila or something.  We gotta do that again.  God hammered.  It was great.  Yeah, man.  What a fucking piss.  It was after Caroline's.  I mean, I don't condone drinking.  We shouldn't do that.  I don't either.  But we should get together and have some tea.  We should just hang out.  Totally sober and hang out until the sun comes up.  It tells the story every once in a while.  And that's when you head home because you hate mornings.  I hate mornings.  We walked out of Caroline's. 
[02:31:00]  The sun was coming up.  And I heard, you just got done with Caroline.  You did your last show.  Brian Regan in your car.  My favorite is when you tell the story is how he changes a little bit.  Oh, it was fucking fun.  A little bit.  Brian just talks and it's fun.  It's a lot of fun because, you know, you get more of an insight.  You know, because we have Brian on.  He's a fun guy and shit.  And we love him.  And then you get more of an insight of Brian Regan, the guy, when you're hanging out.  Not Brian Regan, the comic.  And it was just, no, it was fantastic. 
[02:31:30]  We hung out and we actually left Caroline's.  We closed Caroline's and found another bar.  It was another place we went to, I remember.  It was like right across.  Oh, were we fucking staggering.  We gotta do that.  Let's make a, let's make a, a date.  It was good.  If that's okay to say it with guys.  A date with a man.  Yes.  A man date.  Oh, boy.  Hey, what do you think of that election there, Brian Regan?  Do you, are you political much?  Don't tell me.  I taped it.  I taped it.  Oh.  No. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's what it is, right?  Yeah.  You don't want to alienate half your audience.  I understand.  50% of the people voted for the other guy.  You don't want to alienate them.  I understand.  50%.  I think either candidate.  Oh.  All right.  49.9 or whatever it is.  48.  Don't inflate your numbers, Anthony.  Oh, man.  Please.  Wait.  You did a write-in or you didn't, you voted for someone other than the two?  What am I not understanding? 
[02:32:30]  Well, I said 50% of the people and she's implying that since they didn't tie.  I got you.  Uh, and Mr. Romney did not win.  Okay.  I forgot his name already.  Thank you for reminding me.  It was him, Romney.  Who won Florida?  Have they figured that out yet?  Oh, boy.  They gave it to Obama.  Did they?  Did they just toss it to him?  Just like, ah, fuck it.  Or do they really count?  Fuck it.  We don't feel like counting all this shit, so let's just give it to Obama.  Sit down there.  One, two, three.  Oh, I lost count all day.  I can't understand. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  We got to get Brian out of here for his big taping with CBS.  And we got Roger Moore coming in, too.  Yeah.  You going to be around for a while, or are you in and out?  Well, I got the thing tonight, and then I leave tomorrow.  That stinks.  You are fucking like a rapid deployment force.  Yeah, man.  He's got a tour bus.  Oh, you're doing the tour bus, though?  Tour bus.  That's being gay.  He just looks at him like, what the fuck are you doing?  I ain't going on my spot.  I got a tour bus.  You know, it's funny. 
[02:33:30]  If I get off, it's just, you know, nondescript.  I don't have anything on it.  And if I get off, people ask me, who's on the tour bus?  Such an ego deflator.  Who's on there?  Who's on the bus?  That's terrible.  So, I stopped saying me, because clearly that's not impressive.  So, we made up a name, and we would say Merle Scruffles, just for a goof.  And it's amazing how many people go, oh, I love him.  Oh, no, they do not.  Yeah.  No, Merle Scruffles. 
[02:34:00]  It joins us this Sunday morning.  That sounds like a great way to see the country, though.  Yeah.  On a bus.  You like it, right?  Yeah.  It's cool, right?  Can't complain.  It's probably all decked out, guys.  It is good, man.  They want to throw us on a tour bus.  Fucking bitches, you get the bitches in there, right?  Fucking get them bitches.  Supposedly, we're getting...  Ryan just looks at me like, what the fuck?  Supposedly, we're getting Madden's bus.  We're getting Madden's old bus.  And they want us to do a little tour for like a week.  Really?  Yeah.  They got that smell out of it?  You know that, right? 
[02:34:30]  No.  They're trying to figure it out.  They didn't tell me that.  And what, are you going to broadcast out of the bus?  Yeah, like...  No!  Get around the country?  A city a day for a week.  Oh, really?  They're talking like this is a real deal.  We're going to grab Madden's old bus.  Really?  Madden's old bus?  Yeah.  You'll have fun.  I would love to do that.  I would love to just travel around the country.  That'd be awesome.  We've got to get Brian out of here.  So Brian...  I'm going to push my pants.  Yeah, Brian's playing the Beacon Theater.  Tickets available?  I don't know.  I would highly doubt it, but... 
[02:35:00]  Just check, because sometimes they release them last minute.  They release actually good seats that were performer comps.  And if you're not going to use 100 comps, they'll actually release them for purchasing  the good seats.  Brian Reagan at the Beacon Theater.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, check it out.  Save them comps for you guys.  Nah.  Nah.  I'd go in a second.  I'm flying L.A. after the show.  I can't.  I'm doing Toronto.  He is.  I'm married to Rich.  Really?  Isn't it?  Oh, Bonnie.  Oh.  That's terrible. 
[02:35:30]  All right, Richie.  Brian, you promoting anything else?  I think that...  I don't know.  Wilkes-Barre.  Wilkes-Barre.  Tomorrow.  Yes.  No.  Yeah, tomorrow.  And then Syracuse Sunday.  Okay.  And I did that Jerry Seinfeld comedians in cars getting coffee thing.  Oh, that's fucking great, man.  Yeah, that was fun to do.  Yeah.  That was very funny, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  How did they think of that name?  And Sunday morning on CBS.  We'll be watching.  All right, thanks.  All right, Brian Regan.  It's always a pleasure.  Thank you all.  Rich and Bonnie.  Are they sticking around for a little more? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, as well.  All right.  Of course.  You're James Bond, right?  We got James Bond.  We don't want to be alone with one another.  All right.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Roger Moore next.  Coming soon to Broadway, Jim Norton of The Opie and Anthony Show stars as that lovable  red-headed orphan in the new production of Annie.  The sun will come out.  Come on, Jimmy.  Tomorrow.  You got to lay in bed and die of cancer tomorrow.  Like Yul Brynner.  Oh, you used to be fun in the sun, but now you're shitting in your bed. 
[02:36:30]  And your head is full of mush like Lyle Alzado.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's been a hell of a week of radio.  We're going to end it with Roger Moore in a little bit.  That's so cool.  Is he here?  Ricky Gervais was on. 
[02:37:00]  Billy Connolly was yesterday.  Jay was in a couple days.  Russell Peters.  We had a good show.  Louis C.K.  Oh, yeah.  Louis came in.  A lot of comedians.  Richard Bonnier here.  Brian Regan.  Their movie premieres tomorrow at Caroline's.  One o'clock is part of the comedy festival.  Women Aren't Funny.  I've seen it.  It's great.  People are going to love it.  You should go and check it out at Caroline's tomorrow at 1.  And next week.  Is this real?  Yeah.  That's how dumb he is.  Is this real?  Yeah.  What are you doing? 
[02:37:30]  Bond.  Oh, Bond.  Very good.  No, but really fast before he gets in here.  You've got to know about this.  Do you know what Eric's doing?  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is so stupid.  What are you doing?  It's not stupid.  Yes, it is stupid.  Why is it stupid?  No, you tell us why it's not.  You tell us why it's not stupid.  Because it's a famous scene from The Simpsons.  It's a famous James Bond scene from The Simpsons.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  And he wants him to sign it.  I'm sorry.  I didn't realize.  Yeah.  It's a big joke.  Where he's trying to auction off a signed portrait of Sean Connery as signed by Roger Moore. 
[02:38:00]  Oh.  You know what?  I stand corrected.  Oh, did we just get slapped hard?  You know what?  I apologize.  And you know what?  E-Rock had a lot of confidence.  My apologies.  I think all of our apologies to E-Rock.  We couldn't wait to smash you.  You can tell no one's full of shit because he's acting because his eyes opened up real big  when he apologized.  No, but I was being genuine.  No, he got us.  Yeah, he got us.  We're fair on the show.  Bring him right in.  When E-Rock gets us, you know, that's it.  Here.  Rip that up. 
[02:38:30]  No!  Roger Moore is coming into the studio.  Roger.  No, that's...  Sir Roger Moore.  Sir Roger Moore.  Hello, sir.  Sir Roger Moore.  Hello.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Have a seat.  There you go.  Wow.  Yes.  Legendary.  Look at how well-dressed.  Always the consummate gentleman.  Oh, sir.  Yes.  It's natural.  Yes.  Well, I'm assuming, of course...  It's not paid for.  No.  Okay.  There you go.  Take a seat. 
[02:39:00]  We're actually on the air.  We like doing things like that right away.  Got that?  There we go.  There we are.  Very good, sir.  You have headphones if you need him.  If you need him.  Roger Moore.  This is fantastic.  Don't mind these people.  Just fans.  You know.  They're fans of yours.  Who is it, though?  James Bond.  What's going on now with you?  Bond on Bond.  Reflections on 50 years of James Bond movies.  Roger Moore.  Well, it just happened to be the 50th anniversary of Bond coming up.  50th anniversary. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  And my publisher thought that it would be a very good idea if I brought out a book with my opinion of Bond.  And now, this is not just your opinion, of course, on the Bond that you had played through the years, but every Bond from the beginning.  Who was the first?  Was it Sean Connery?  Yes, Sean Connery.  I thought maybe there was, because sometimes they throw in that one or two guys where it was like, ah, no one really paid attention to him.  No, in the Eon films, it was Sean.  Sean, yeah.  Sean, then George Lazenby. 
[02:40:00]  Right.  That's the one everybody goes, who was that?  But George Lazenby got talked out of doing more Bond movies by, like, his guru or something?  Well, he sort of behaved badly.  Oh, did he?  And when Cubby Broccoli asked him, you know, why did she behave so badly when we were working?  He said, well, because Harry, Harry Saltzman, told me to behave like a movie star.  Oh, no.  And he thought movie stars sent cars back and ate garlic before a loaf seat. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, boy.  That didn't work out too well.  So are you kind of grateful for that, for his kind of behaving irrationally?  Because then all of a sudden you came alone.  Well, Sean came back.  Oh.  And then they came to me.  Yeah, yeah.  For the second time.  They'd been once, because I knew, I was very clever.  They gambled.  And I used to gamble with them at the gaming dens of London. 
[02:41:00]  Oh.  I was very clever.  I let them win so that they felt they could owe me something.  Smart.  And it worked.  It worked.  It worked.  Around the same time, I was about to start a series called The Persuaders, which I shot  at Pinewood Studios, where my offices are now.  And so we took a couple of stages there. 
[02:41:30]  Why am I talking about this?  You could just talk about that.  Oh, sorry.  It's interesting.  It's interesting.  It is, yeah.  Why are you nodding them?  Why are you nodding them?  Oh, no.  Because she's on heroin.  I'm a big fan of The Saint.  Thank you.  The Saint.  You got to drive a P-1800.  A P-1800.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's an old Volvo.  Yeah.  Nice cars.  Well, you got your fair share of nice cars to drive in the Bond movies, too, of course. 
[02:42:00]  Did you actually drive in a few of those, or was it usually a movie playing behind you?  Well, I didn't do very much dangerous stuff in them.  No.  I was, my favorite was a little de chevaux, you know, the little two horsepower.  Oh, that tiny little thing.  You know, because, you know, it's a car that you don't worry about hitting.  Right.  It's so hideous to start with.  And it's a relief when you give it a nice bang. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  So, when you finally got the job, did you have any reservations about signing on for  a franchise role like that?  Well, it was just to do three.  I never really thought it would go more than one more.  Really?  But it caught on.  It certainly did.  And my sort of idiotic way of playing it sort of got away with it. 
[02:43:00]  It was a very tongue-in-cheek Bond as opposed to, I think, like the earlier Bonds that were  more, well, not as tongue-in-cheek is what I'm trying to say.  Earnest.  Earnest.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  Well, that's why I will say that this is a very uncomfortable chair.  Oh, my God.  This is the best you can afford here.  Very uncomfortable.  Very uncomfortable house.  Very uncomfortable house.  Where were we?  Yeah, the, uh, you, uh, you, uh, you, uh, you, uh, you, uh, I know, I know, see what 
[02:43:30]  happened to me?  Tongue-in-cheek in a minute.  Yes.  Yeah.  Was that the way you played it or did he start writing them that way?  No, Sean, I say, played it like a killer.  I played it like a lover.  Uh, and now I think, uh, uh, Daniel Craig plays a real killer.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, I believe him.  How do you, how do you, uh, like the Daniel Craig version?  I think they're the best. 
[02:44:00]  Do you?  Yeah.  They are really amazingly, uh, well done.  Um, they, they really did put a little more, uh, grit into it.  That's for sure.  The fight scenes.  Um, but it's, it's also, also very moving.  It shows, uh, Bond's vulnerability.  Yeah.  Uh, and the relationship with, with Judi Dench, which was wonderful.  Mm-hmm.  We won't give anything away.  No, no, no.  Is it hard to watch other guys after you've done that role?  Like the guy right after you, is it kind of hard to go and like, wow, that's not my, 
[02:44:30]  that's not my gig anymore?  Well, I, I didn't, uh, must, I, I must say I didn't look at the first two after me.  Uh, not out of bitterness, but I just find it difficult to lie that bare face with somebody  who says, what do you think?  Like, so I said, I haven't seen it, which is much easier than saying, oh, it was very  good.  Well, actually, I've been back and I've looked at them and he was very good.  Very good.  Indeed.  Who came right after you? 
[02:45:00]  Timothy Dalton.  Oh, okay.  Oh, right.  And then Pierce Brosnan.  Mm.  Mm.  And then there was a pause and now we got Daniel.  Yeah.  Wasn't there like a six year layoff or something?  Yeah.  There was, there were little problems going on with MGM.  And the usual power game that goes on.  Yeah.  It was also very, very odd to have the cold war end because that was the nemesis usually  was some type of cold war thing going on.  Uh, so you kind of had to come up with a new, uh, mission. 
[02:45:30]  Uh, yeah, a new nemesis.  But there, you know, when I started playing with a, not playing, I hate, I mustn't say  that word, when working with, uh, as a mover, I can never remember her name.  Her name is Barbara Bach.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, very easy on the eye.  Certainly.  Uh, and, uh, who introduced Jaws in that.  It was the first time I'd worked with the director, Lewis Gilbert, who's sort of slightly manic 
[02:46:00]  as, as I am.  And, uh, a wonderful villain, Kurt Jorgensen.  Yeah.  Had wonderful toys to play with.  Absolutely.  The wind bike.  Yeah, yeah.  Which nobody had ever seen one before.  Yeah, and then it just became something that, uh, was, uh, reality.  Yeah, a few, there were a few Bond things that, uh, kind of came to fruition after,  uh, a few years.  There was, there was, there was one, one guy that I wrote about in the book, which, uh,  was, uh, being able to stay underwater. 
[02:46:30]  Uh, and they, they called and said, how long, you know, the ministry called to find out,  how long could you stay underwater, really?  It's as long as you can hold your breath.  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  There were those little mouthpiece, uh, items that looked like, uh, two CO2 cartridges  and a mouthpiece and they'd pop it in and be swimming underwater and people thought it  was real and were like, hey, wait a minute, that sounds like a pretty good idea. 
[02:47:00]  How long can you swim with it?  Yeah.  As long as you can hold your breath because it wasn't real.  A lot of people kind of, uh, make that mistake.  Yeah.  I would like an oil slick though in my car, a smoke screen, uh, ejector seat, uh, blades.  Blades out of the hubcaps would be really good.  Uh, uh, police siren is always useful.  You know what?  Something as simple as that.  Yeah.  Do you think, uh, Flint tried to steal, uh, Bond, uh, Flint?  Yeah.  Flint, yeah.  Well, they did. 
[02:47:30]  We see after the mistake was that they tried to make a parody out of a parody.  Uh, Bond is a parody, really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's over the top.  Sure.  Especially back in, uh, yeah, the seventies.  Back in the old days.  Especially, yeah.  Yeah.  Today it is, it's real stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, the stunts are just fantastic.  Pretty amazing.  There were some pretty good ones.  I mean, you really couldn't see, well, you'd not really couldn't, you couldn't CGI things  back then.  So whatever stunts you were seeing, like that, uh, the car that went over the ramp and did 
[02:48:00]  a complete rotation, that stuff's all real.  The, uh, the mini jet, uh, that was real.  Uh, I mean, uh, that you couldn't, you had to have really good stuntmen back then.  Yeah.  The only sort of fake things, I suppose, were the falsies.  Falsies.  The falsies and the girls, right?  I was talking earlier about how, um, I, I loved when, uh, you would be on a skiing,  uh, thing, something skiing, and you'd see the, the skiers swishing down the mountain, 
[02:48:30]  and then there'd be you, uh, with the goggles on, camera right in your face, with the film  playing behind you, kind of, you know, shooting, and then it would show the skiers again, and,  uh, you know, the effects back then, uh, you know, you had to use your imagination a  little more.  Well, that's, that's what movies are for.  Yeah.  To make you imagine things.  Right.  Imagine that he is skiing down the mountain, and it is James Pond.  Yes, indeed.  And imagine that this is not radio. 
[02:49:00]  That's what I was going to say.  Imagine somebody's listening to this.  You're on it.  Do you, uh, do you feel bad for the way, because Sean has a really weird relationship with the  franchise, because he's angry about the way things went on, and, and, and, he's like the  only Bond that is kind of not a part of promoting it or anything like that.  Yeah, well, he, he, uh, rather resented the fact that he thought that he was not being  remunerated enough, and he got fed up with people calling him Mr. Bond all the time. 
[02:49:30]  He felt he was losing his identity.  Uh, and he sort of fell out with them, and he said some pretty bad things about Cubby.  Cubby Broccoli, who was, who was a wonderful man, and a dear, dear friend of mine, and he  had said something that had upset Cubby very much, and I wanted to, to clear it between  them, and I, I was living in California at the time, and had a dinner party, and I invited 
[02:50:00]  Cubby, and I invited Sean, and I sat the mix together, and I, the first part of the conversation  I heard was, Cubby said, Sean, did you really say if my brains were on fire, you wouldn't  piss in my ear to put it down?  He said, it's not true, Cubby.  He said, I'm pissing you any bloody time. 
[02:50:30]  And did that help things, or did, uh.  It was there at the end of the, you know, there was a making up before, before Cubby  died.  There was a documentary done for Epics, where all of the, you guys, except for Sean, were  interviewed, and they showed the whole Cubby story, and who was Cubby's partner?  It was Harry Saltzman.  And then how they got together, and it was fascinating to watch the way the franchise went, and the  lawsuits over.  Yeah, it's very interesting that they go, that Harry Saltzman had acquired the rights, 
[02:51:00]  and he came to Cubby, because Cubby was producing films with a deal with Columbia, a company called  Warwick Films.  They made a lot of Alan Ladd movies, and he thought that Cubby would be able to come in  with him, and get Columbia's backing.  Well, Columbia, some net at Columbia turned Bond down.  And they couldn't have it for a million dollars.  And it's made a million since. 
[02:51:30]  I wonder where that fellow's had his rolling line, or if it stopped rolling.  Wow.  But then Cubby had a relationship with United Artists, and he said he would come over there  with it.  And Harry, he had to loan Harry the money to get to New York, and Karim shook Cubby's  hand and said, we have a deal. 
[02:52:00]  Harry got in the street, and he said, I wanted him riding.  Get him riding.  And Cubby had to go back and say, look, could you just give us a line or two?  Smart, yeah.  But, you see, there was the difference between Cubby and Harry.  Harry had bright ideas, and was very gung-ho about doing things.  Cubby, a little more laid back.  For me, one of the most caring producers I ever had the pleasure of working with, or taking 
[02:52:30]  money off.  What do you think, what has the franchise made?  Do you know, like, an estimate?  It's well over a billion dollars, I think, right?  Oh, hell yeah.  You know, there are figures I can't even imagine.  Well, I suppose I could if I got a few years older.  How did being Bond affect your career after you were done playing Bond?  Well, all the time that I was doing Bond, I was offered things that were sort of like  similar to Bond, which I didn't want to do. 
[02:53:00]  I got fed up with being blown up.  And, you know, all the acting was trying not to blink when guns go off.  I hate, I hate to have guns.  And, you know, for the last 21 years, I've been an ambassador for UNICEF.  And the picture that's always being sent to me to sign is the Bond one holding the gun.  Sure, yeah.  It's not an image I like.  Wow, really?  That's because, I mean, you're synonymous. 
[02:53:30]  Bond's synonymous with his gun, Walter.  But you, not so much.  No, I don't like them.  Do you still feel guilty about pushing that kid out of the boat?  Yeah, I feel terrible.  I really do.  I was absolutely horrified.  Wow.  When I see that.  You really, you really don't?  Well, poor little Thai boy.  Yeah, yeah.  Kicking him off the side of a sandpan.  I've been in that water.  Mark, he had the antibodies in his system to fight off the disease. 
[02:54:00]  I went in there a couple of times in the Klongs in Bangkok.  Wow.  And I saw strange things in the bottom.  I made the mistake of opening my eyes because the sandpans, the boats with the long, long tail.  So, to turn, you have to pull the whole engine towards you to go that way.  Oh, man.  That is a gesture we see on television. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Push my hand around to the right.  Right.  And so I over-tipped as I came around a corner where there was an undertaker.  And I think those that hadn't paid their installment.  Oh, man.  They put him in the drink.  Wow.  But I had to open my eyes because I wanted to know where that propeller was.  Right.  And another time I went in rather heroically to stop a boat. 
[02:55:00]  Did you get affected?  Your eyes or the water do anything like that?  Oh, they pumped me all sorts of things.  Oh, wow.  But I nearly didn't do the film at the beginning because when we got to New Orleans on the bayous and I'm driving the jet boat, the jet boat steers by the propellers, you know, the jet propulsion run.  And so to turn, you put on more power. 
[02:55:30]  It's the absolute opposite to normal motorboat driving.  Anyway, so I was going around a bend and the gas tank wasn't quite full.  Oh, man.  And it stalled.  Right.  So you end up going in a straight line.  You have no steering.  You can't turn.  And straight into a stupid boathouse at the side.  They had inconveniently left.  Oh, man.  And I went forward and I smashed my teeth. 
[02:56:00]  Wow.  And my knees threw into the back of the boat.  So for the first three weeks of filming, it was fortunately mostly in the boat.  I was on a cane.  Really?  Not a Michael cane.  Yeah, yeah.  So you weren't able to walk without a cane and your teeth were smashed.  Jesus.  And one day when we were shooting in New Orleans, a messenger just came in.  Yeah, right. 
[02:56:30]  Get him off.  No.  No, it doesn't say get him off.  The note says Bond franchise, $5 billion to date.  Wow.  It's number two behind Harry Potter.  That's it.  I guess the biggest franchise ever.  Wow.  But Harry Potter won't go on for 50 years.  No, it won't.  I don't think so.  Harry Potter's done.  We all know it.  Wow.  Don't tell me that.  I have a question, too.  Oh, I forgot what I wanted to ask. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, you silly goose.  I totally forgot.  I don't know, but Roger Moore has beautiful fingernails.  I can't take my eyes off his fingernails.  He's a sir.  Yeah.  He's a manicured gentleman.  That's how a sir looks.  A sir is.  That's what I wanted to ask you, actually, about becoming Sir Roger Moore.  What did they say to you?  Does that mean you've been knighted?  What does that mean?  I don't know what the name is.  I'm a KBE, which means I'm a knight commander of the order of the British Empire.  Nice. 
[02:57:30]  That sounds pretty important.  So just a little respect.  You know, I'm not just a piece of...  And how do they do that?  What is the ceremony?  The sword.  Rich is going to tell it.  Yeah, sure.  You want to tell everyone, Rich?  Yeah, there you go.  You just eat with your mouth closed.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I'm absolutely petrified.  The thing that worried me about it was I knew that I had to kneel, and I didn't know  whether I'd get up again.  And I called Michael Caine, who'd been knighted two years before, and he said, 
[02:58:00]  Oh, don't worry.  There is a rail that you can put your hand on.  Well, the most important moment of your career, probably, is getting tapped on the shoulder  by the queen, and it goes on the right shoulder and the left shoulder.  And I thought she might just swish it across my neck.  And I'm a terrible coward, and I should have kept my eyes open to record it.  Remember the moment.  I just shut my eyes.  You didn't like a sword being that close to your head. 
[02:58:30]  I heard, dunk, dunk, shish.  I had my head still there.  Pushed myself up.  And then you talk with the queen until she dismisses you.  You don't get to go out drinking with her?  You don't go out drinking or with the queen?  Drinking with the queen.  Well, no.  Daniel Craig used to do skydiving with her.  Yeah, yeah.  What did you talk to the queen about?  Does she carry the conversation, or do you have to propel it? 
[02:59:00]  You don't address the queen.  She addresses you.  And she says, have you, did you come far?  Things are, what are you doing now?  Oh, wow.  No, she's...  Very hard to have a conversation.  She's very good.  And I think the one thing about her, you're fascinated by her eyes when she's very close to you.  Yeah.  And I must say that I was always fascinated by her legs.  I was...  Wow.  We had a fundraising scheme with British Airways called Change for Good, where people put money in. 
[02:59:30]  And I was sort of spokesperson for this.  And the queen came for the anniversary of it to the British Airways private section at Heathrow.  And I had to go up the steps naturally behind her.  Of course.  Of a 747. 
[03:00:00]  And I could not have noticed, but her legs were just beautiful.  Wow.  She's a year older than I am.  And she doesn't have one mark, one vein.  Just...  That Prince Philip's a lucky man.  Yeah, huh?  Did you tell her that?  No.  Yeah.  That would have been...  That would have been a little awkward.  Yeah.  It's a little disrespectful, perhaps.  But do we have anything of that equal in the U.S.? 
[03:00:30]  Because in England, that's such an honor to be knighted.  But I don't know if we have an equivalent honor here.  Yeah.  Well, yes.  What is it?  Oh, the Kennedy Honors or something like that?  No, no.  It's the Freedom.  Something like that.  Oh, the Medal of Freedom.  Oh, the Medal of Freedom.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a civilian...  Sinatra had it.  ...honor.  Yeah, yeah.  But it still doesn't have the pomp and circumstance of being knighted.  That's something that's so British.  Yes.  And people do address you as Sir Roger Moore. 
[03:01:00]  They'd better.  I don't know.  Only those that I'm pointing my sword at.  Yes.  You got a suit of armor?  You didn't get a suit of armor with that?  No.  That'd be great if you'd really took it seriously.  Dressed in a suit of armor and a horse.  A white horse.  Yes.  It'd be great.  Do some Sirs look down on other Sirs like going, I can't believe they Sir'd him?  You know?  Sir.  They Sir'd.  As a matter of fact, we do.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:01:30]  That's a good question.  Like Paul McCartney is Sir Paul McCartney.  And Elton John.  I mean, where do you draw the line?  Yeah.  But are there people out there all night and you'll go, ugh?  No, I would never criticize what they're doing with their honor system.  It's a wonderful system and recognition to people who do public good.  Yeah.  And so it's a lot of civil servants, tax officials. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, boy.  Tax officials get knighted Sir?  Of course they do.  Oh, boy.  They're first.  No, they don't get Sir.  They get, we start off with an OBE, an MBE, an OBE, and a CBE, and then knighthood.  Oh, and then you get the KBE.  Oh, okay.  So not everybody that gets knighted is a Sir.  Oh, yes.  If they're knighted, they're a sir.  Oh, knighted.  KBE.  That's knight of the British Empire.  Okay.  But what is it called if you're just like one of these lower level guys? 
[03:02:30]  You.  It's just you, huh?  Hey, you.  Actually, they're all very, very proud of their MBEs and their OBEs.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Yeah.  But they don't get addressed as anything different until they're knighted.  No.  You either become a dame if you're a lady.  Nothing like a dame.  Yeah.  You got a dame Judi Dench.  Of course.  I don't know the great Judi Dench.  Yeah.  Some wonderful dames. 
[03:03:00]  I love dames.  Hey, you dame.  Your book, by the way, we should promote your book.  Yes, of course.  Roger's here promoting a book.  Or Sir Roger's promoting a...  Roger.  Okay.  Just call him Roger.  Yeah.  We've been hanging out long enough.  I know, but again, I don't want to seem like a Rube.  Roger.  It's called Roger.  Roger.  Uh, Bond on Bond.  It's reflections on 50 years of James Bond movies by Roger Moore.  And, um...  A lot of great pictures.  It's an amazing book.  And there's a great picture of you and Richard Keel in here.  And there's just... 
[03:03:30]  Every page has got a great photo on it.  And this is just your take on the whole franchise.  Yeah.  A lot of research went into finding out the real figures and facts.  Like, you've just got your 8 billion franchise.  Yes.  A lot of money.  A lot of money.  And I must say that your movies did have the best Bond songs out of all the Bond movies.  Those were the ones that were...  I mean, hit after hit during the 70s with the Bond songs.  Well, there was Goldfinger. 
[03:04:00]  Well, Goldfinger early on, sure.  But, I mean, when you look at, like, Live and Let Die...  Uh, great, great...  And, uh...  Spy Who Loved Me.  Spy Who Loved Me was another...  Nobody does it.  Nobody does it.  Yeah, yeah.  Huge...  That sort of sums up Bond, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Those were huge songs in the 70s.  I mean, you didn't go anywhere without those being blasted on the radio.  And now the Adele song.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, she's doing this one.  It's just brilliant.  Skyfall, yeah.  What ended your reign as Bond? 
[03:04:30]  Was it something you wanted to end, or did they say, we have to move on?  Well, they caught me getting out of my wheelchair.  LAUGHTER  No, I knew that I should be thinking about moving on, you know, to the old actor's home.  When you bend down to kiss a girl on a three-chins show, and then you realize a girl is younger  than your granddaughter, you know, and no, no, this is really, I'm a dirty old man. 
[03:05:00]  It starts to not feel right.  Yeah, so...  Let you know when that happens.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'll let you know when that happens.  And you're on Twitter as well.  Ooh.  Yes, I did a Twitter.  I'd never done it before.  Sir Roger Moore, it's all one word, on Twitter.  Now, do you send...  You've sent out tweets before?  No, I've never done it before, but they wanted to do a half hour on tweet. 
[03:05:30]  Yes, I'm sure there's some type of representative of you and your interest that uses that, and  people can read what is posted.  I hope they're not doing horrible things like sending pictures that might not be, you  know...  Oh.  That would be terrible.  It's your name there.  We don't need people sending inappropriate things.  I hope you can trust that person that's running that Twitter account.  I don't know who's running it.  Oh, boy. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, no.  Could you find out again?  I think you're about to find out.  I think it's something Connery.  Did you ever hang out with, like, the movie stars in America, like Sinatra and people  like that?  Me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give us a good story.  Give us a story.  Oh, dear.  Well, you know, Gregory Peck was a good friend of mine, and I made a film with him in India,  in Goa.  Which movie was that?  It was called Sea Wolves. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Another.  You were a...  Oh, my God.  Which one were you in?  Another.  You were in a few war movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A mercenary story.  Yeah.  The Wild Geese.  Wild Geese.  Yes.  With Richard Burton.  Richard Burton.  That was a good one.  And Richard Harris and Hardy Kruger, who Burton insisted on calling Deadly Luger.  Here comes Deadly Luger.  That's quite a collection of actors.  Geez.  Well, we had a wonderful collection of actors in the Sea Wolves, Gregory Peck and David 
[03:07:00]  Levin, Patrick McNeil.  Submarine movie.  The Thin Man.  It started with a submarine, but it really wasn't a submarine.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a true story about the Calcutta Light Horse, who were a bunch of territorials.  They were volunteers, and they were all slightly over the hill, and they got into Goa to sink 
[03:07:30]  the might of Germany's fleet.  How'd that work out?  We won.  All right.  Nice to hear.  So, if you took an acting class back in the day, was there anybody else, like, in the  class?  I don't even know if you did it.  I cringe at Richard's question.  I know.  Don't you turn out to be a good question?  I know, but I go like, oh, no.  You're not sure it's going to work out?  No, but I mean, like, he could have been in acting class with Olivia.  You don't know who he was in acting class with if he took an act. 
[03:08:00]  Some people are natural actors.  I don't know if you did.  I'm neither.  What's that?  You're neither.  You're neither?  No.  Yes, I went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1944.  I started there.  Wow.  And at that time, there were 16 girls to four boys in a class because the war called everybody  up.  And the other boys were a bit... 
[03:08:30]  Not really interested in the girls.  They were more than a act.  And so, yeah, I learned a lot about sex and nothing about acting.  There you go.  Well, yeah, the pick of the litter there, right?  But the one girl who became a lifelong friend, whose name was Lois Hooker, and that was not  appropriate as a name for an actress.  Of some standing, she became Lois Maxwell, and was my Miss Moneypenny.  Moneypenny, yeah.  I love the lady. 
[03:09:00]  Got to work.  Were you married when you did...  Have you ever been married, or were you married when you did Bond?  Yes.  So that must have been frustrating, because that's when all the girls kind of come around.  Well, it's not frustrating.  Just keep the wife out of the house.  You know, that's what, I think it was, Tony Curtis told me that, but Lancaster said that  if you're in your dressing room with a leading lady or somebody off the set, and your wife  walks in, continue. 
[03:09:30]  And when you get home tonight, saying, it wasn't me, they just have people who look like me.  My standard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's trouble.  You're trying to be a method actor.  Something tells me that would pan out.  That helps.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I've got a terrible method.  What do you like watching?  Like, you know, what do you enjoy?  I mean, do you watch films that are in that genre, or do you, like, completely the opposite?  I look at all the Academy-nominated films. 
[03:10:00]  They send me the screeners.  I don't go to the movies.  I live in the winter in Switzerland, and I don't want to go and see them in, in, in  Switzerland, and in Monaco.  We have, they have original versions, but I just don't, I'd rather look at television  and watch all the old comedy shows, all the old English comedy shows, that is, like keeping  up appearances and one foot in the grave, things that you, you don't know. 
[03:10:30]  I don't know about my career.  You're such a modest chap.  You're like me.  Can I see your fingernails?  No.  007's his IQ.  Anyway, it's great talking with you, and if you want to continue the conversation,  come to Barnes & Noble.  Oh, it's an answer about a signing.  Yes, come on, the signing. 
[03:11:00]  You know what, it's right in front of me.  The book signing is tonight at 6 p.m.  It's Barnes & Noble on 5th Avenue and 18th Street.  It's a great Barnes & Noble.  It's a very large one, so there's plenty of room to stand inside, no matter how cold it  is outside.  You're not going to get stuck outside, and Roger will sign your book.  I didn't even think to ask about a signing.  It's a nice big book with a lot of great pictures and information in it.  I mean, the history that's in here, and everybody, I mean, everybody grew up watching  Bond.  It's amazing. 
[03:11:30]  Excuse me, but when you're finished reading it, when you're finished at Barnes & Noble,  you can then go to the cinema and see Skyfall.  Skyfall.  Skyfall.  That premieres tonight, right?  It's an IMAX.  I want to see that in IMAX.  I really want to see that large.  I was more of a Matt Helm guy.  Matt Helm?  Oh, jeez.  Who was that?  Dean Martin?  Dean Martin.  Dean Martin.  Dean.  I did a film with Dean Martin, Cannonball Run, and because we lived close to one another 
[03:12:00]  in Beverly Hills, where else?  We shared a limo going home at night, and he said, there was some crazy guy around you.  He kept asking me, doing an interview, he asked me what I wanted on my tombstone when  I was dead.  And he said, did he ask you anything?  I said, what did he ask you?  He said, what did I want on my tombstone when I'm dead? 
[03:12:30]  I said, well, what did you say?  He said, I want Dean Martin dead.  And I was then married to somebody else.  And he said, what did you say?  I said, the name of my wife.  I wish you were here.  No, not I wish you were here.  I wish you were here.  Right.  Oh, the great Sir Roger Moore. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, we're very, very happy you came today.  We were looking forward to talking to you very much, more than most people, except for Ozzy  Osbourne.  He loves Ozzy.  Yeah.  Bond on Bond, Roger Moore book.  It is out now in stores.  And again, if you're here in New York and you want to get a book signed by Roger, go to  the signing tonight, Barnes & Noble, 6 p.m.  It's a Friday night.  You know, you have nothing else to do.  So, 5th Avenue and 18th Street.  And thank you for coming.  We're very happy.  Hey, Ron, Mr. Moore, if you're next week, if you're in the Poughkeepsie area, I'm performing 
[03:13:30]  at Bananas Comedy Club next weekend if you're in Poughkeepsie, New York.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  How much is it for entry?  I'll put you on a guest list.  Oh, thank you.  Yes.  He doesn't know what to make.  How about transport to get there?  I'm not sure.  I'm just trying to get a plug-in.  Well, I'd like you to send a car for me.  I'd send a car.  I would send a car.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Well, make a car. 
[03:14:00]  Don't send that piece of crap you drive.  BMW.  Oh, please.  All right.  I got it on eBay.  Get it on eBay, exactly.  Jimmy, great job.  That's it for me.  I'm heading to Toronto, and then I'm in Dallas next week at the Addison Improv, Thursday,  Friday, and Saturday.  Can you get me in there?  Yeah.  Do you want a plane?  This is great, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  See you guys Monday.  Yeah.  This is great.  Absolutely.  The O.D. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand. 
[03:14:30]  After ONA Live is next.  All right.  I thought that would come back on.  You fart all the time.  Why did I get stuck with these two?  You begged us to stay.  I kind of did.  Where's your mics?  What mic are you on, Bonnie?  I'm on.  I switched over to the seven.  Wait.  Seven?  All right.  Okay.  Hey, if you ask any girl, any woman what the best gift she ever got was, without hesitation, 
[03:15:00]  it would be?  My engagement ring.  Wow.  You're not going to play along with this?  Oh, I didn't know.  I thought I was playing along.  No, it's really the engagement ring.  Oh.  Without even thinking about it, she'll say her engagement ring.  Oh, no, my full body wax.  It's so important.  It's not just a ring, not just a sign of affection.  It's everything to her.  Every time she looks down at her finger, every time she washes her hands, every time someone  at the store hands her change, you get credit. 
[03:15:30]  You know what happened to my engagement ring that I bought my wife?  I had to cut it off.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  I do.  She waited like maybe a day too long, and she couldn't get it off.  There's sausage fingers.  Motor oil wouldn't do it.  His wife is really fat.  And then she tried to get it off, which made it fucking swell way more.  And then her finger started turning blue and purple, and I had to snip it off.  Oh, man.  So I have to go back to, I hope this is for Steven Singer, because I've got to go back 
[03:16:00]  there and get a brand new something.  Hopefully not the whole thing.  Go solder the band back.  Bye, guys.  That's what you would do.  Bye, Jimmy.  She's getting a brand new nice one.  I'm just saying, you know.  I don't think she wants her engagement ring soldered.  Not soldered.  They do a gold thing.  Every time she looks down at her finger, every time she walks her eye, you get the credit.  Every time she shows her friends, you get credit.  You get credit for that ring every day, so it's got to be perfect.  And Steven Singer gets that.

He doesn't look like a Snow White character.  Scram.  We're done.  This is my show now.  Whoa.  You know what, Sam?  Sam is in Dopey.  I'm trying to see what Roger Moore wrote to me.  He wrote to Jim.  Yeah, what did he write?  I think he said... 
[03:17:30]  I am delighted to be on your...  I think it's show.  He wrote me a nice little autograph.  Nice.  Delighted.  He took his time with every autograph.  You know why Sam's all nervous that you're doing this show?  Sam has two guests coming on, right?  Do you have the...  Well, I mean...  Who are your guests?  Is that Kelly from Bob's Podcast?  Kelly and DeRosa.  It's not like...  Where's DeRosa?  Is that DeRosa?  Do you got something...  That's not him right there, but he's coming.  You got something for this Kelly Broad.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Why is that?  Oh, shit.  You got something...  Bonnie and DeRosa had a falling out. 
[03:18:00]  Really?  We're no longer speaking.  Why?  What happened?  He...  I was an asshole, I guess, according to him.  Yeah, you don't believe that.  Wow, Joe has a problem with everyone.  When were you an asshole, Bonnie?  Well, I did his...  Everywhere she appeared.  I did a short for him where I played...  I was in one of the shorts.  Yes, that's right.  Mine did way better than yours.  Okay.  Fantastic.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Get things up.  Why don't you call me and, you know, tear me down for 20 minutes?  Did you and him have a...  Wait, he teared you down? 
[03:18:30]  So, he...  So, when I did...  By the way, your short was very, very funny.  I didn't see it.  I didn't watch it, but...  You play a boss.  Yes, I wanted to play the character a little differently, and he didn't want me to, which  I thought was a little weird, that he wouldn't just let people do it however they wanted  to do it.  You know, he was like, you know, Cecil Beast DeMille's.  So, he...  So, anyway, I got there.  He's a little more serious than I...  He's a little intense.  He was intense, but I was joking around. 
[03:19:00]  You guys did it intense?  And, yeah, we did it intense.  I'm going to go...  I'm not doing this.  I'm not doing this.  It was a good story, and he interrupted with a tense.  You did it intense?  It's terrible.  I know it's a joke, but the problem is it's a bad one.  It had none of the makings of a joke.  Go ahead.  She's telling a story.  It was wordplay.  Let's give...  Go ahead.  It was good wordplay.  It's kind of an uncomfortable story.  I'm trying to get out of it.  He's starting to love words.  Is this really an uncomfortable story?  I feel bad.  It's my wife and a friend.  I want to hear what your wife's more important than your friend. 
[03:19:30]  So as soon as Joe gets here, he comes in.  Bonnie, what happened?  So I said to him...  He was telling everybody what the rundown was going to be,  and I said, when do we order pizza?  And I was half joking, but half wanted pizza.  You know what I mean?  But I would have went and gotten my own pizza.  I was just trying to kind of bust his balls about it.  So that was irritating to him.  He had to order pizza now.  He said, I put him in a situation.  He got mad because you asked for pizza?  Yeah, he had to buy the whole crew pizza.  I said, I would have paid for it. 
[03:20:00]  Joe's a chiseler.  What was the whole crew?  How many people were on the crew?  I don't know.  There was a lot of people there.  Like 12?  No, it's a real fucking set.  Yeah, like there's one person that just gets you signed shit.  I mean, I don't know how...  There's five or six.  But how many pizzas is it?  I think he's going to come in.  I don't know.  Well, this was the other thing.  So then we wanted half cheese, half peppers and onions,  and he wouldn't do it.  He's like, no, you'll get all cheese.  And there was like three of us that were like,  well, we want peppers and onions.  Just do it on half. 
[03:20:30]  And he was like, no, just cheese.  What?  Because he was controlling it.  And then finally I was like, Joe, just get it.  And then he was like, fine.  And he got mad.  And then it came.  And then I guess I might have, in front of the crew and everything,  that I was disrespecting the director by forcing him to get it half.  But he's really mad?  Oh, they don't talk.  So then...  They don't talk?  Yeah, yeah, no.  So then I spilled a little piece of one of the peppers on the... 
[03:21:00]  It's all over pizza?  In the thing.  No, it's more than that.  All right.  And then I went to clean up, but Joe started losing his mind.  And I got embarrassed in front of everyone where he was like,  Jesus Christ, Bonnie, you're getting it all over.  And I was trying to clean up.  And then I go, it's not my fault.  Which I guess I shouldn't have yelled that and walked out.  You know, I was just whatever.  And so then he was...  I find this all out later, by the way.  I don't know this is happening. 
[03:21:30]  Okay.  And then he was mad that he had to clean up the pizza.  And then I didn't go...  Off the chair.  Yeah, I didn't go get water or anything.  I just left.  Because I did.  It was a bad move on my part.  I didn't...  Well, it's like I heart Huckabees.  So then stuff just kept happening.  And then, you know, I was...  And then he wanted me to play this really angry character.  So then I had to be angry, like, whatever.  And I would be angry.  And then he got mad that I was angry at the shoot.  But he wanted you to take it seriously. 
[03:22:00]  Right.  But I wasn't allowed to be angry in between shots.  But I kind of had to because it was like a very...  Yeah, you play the character.  It was like exhausting to try to just be like...  Right, right, right.  Method.  So he was kind of getting on my nerves, too.  He's kind of intense.  And whatever.  And...  I showed up unprepared.  So, well, this is what happened at the end.  He was really...  I knew all my lines.  I was like...  I had a character ready to go that he wouldn't let me do.  Anyway, that's...  What do you mean he wouldn't let you do a character?  Hold on, hold on.  I wanted to play the character a little more like... 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  ...Valley Girl.  And he wouldn't have it.  No, he wanted me to just be an angry...  He didn't even want you to have peppers on your pizza.  Right.  No, he's controlling.  He's like a real director.  So anyway, this happens.  It's fine.  I leave.  I know we didn't have the greatest shooting relationship.  I guess at one point while he was telling me what to do, I go, I really hate you.  And...  But you're joking.  I was, but I was also trying to break the tension because it was getting too intense.  And that's my fucking...  I don't know why I think that'll help break tension, but I did. 
[03:23:00]  It's also, Mike.  So I did that.  So this all comes out later.  So he calls me.  I'm now...  I'm in LA and I get a call from him and he's...  You know, the build up to that he's going to tell me off is 20 minutes.  So I said, you know what?  Can you just email it to me?  Because I can't...  I don't have time to like...  Email the tell-off?  Yeah.  Like, so he got mad.  So then he started freaking out and then...  Whatever.  So we're having this back and forth and I kept hanging up on him and then it was like 
[03:23:30]  he kept texting me and then...  I think he's...  But every time he started...  It's really funny.  There's an attraction there.  Every time he started to tell me what was going on, he would...  He'd say...  I'd defend myself and he'd go, I don't want you to talk.  Don't talk.  Or he let me talk for five minutes and then he'd go, I let you talk.  Now you let me talk.  But what...  And this is not on the set anymore.  This is days later.  This is days later.  So he's not controlling.  Hold on.  I said to him at this point, I said, look, I know what's going to happen.  Right. 
[03:24:00]  I go, we're probably never going to work together again.  Okay.  But now you're risking a friendship.  So do you really...  Like, what is going to be the end result of this?  Like, do you really want to go through with this?  And he did.  So I had to sit there for 20 minutes while he told me.  Literally every asshole move...  He even went back to cheat and he was like, you're an asshole on cheat.  He said, no one liked you?  No one liked you on that set?  He said, no one liked you on this set?  He said, no.  He goes, after you left, everyone looked at me and was like, what was her problem? 
[03:24:30]  You know, like they had a meeting about me after I left.  Here's where we thought she was an asshole.  Everybody put, why do you think she's an asshole on a piece of paper?  And we'll, let's talk about it.  We got to get Joe DeRosa's side of the story.  Absolutely.  Oh, he's got a side, believe you me.  I heard it for 20 minutes.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let me get in here.  Because I like breaking shit down.  I got to just add one more thing.  All right, yeah.  So that was how long ago?  I don't know.  We were in LA.  It was like months ago.  That's a couple months ago.  A month and a half ago?  Yeah.  Yesterday. 
[03:25:00]  No.  I got a phone call from him.  I didn't pick up.  I was like, oh shit.  Now I think I should have picked up and went, well, well, well.  But I didn't pick up.  And he left a nice message about congratulations on your movie and good luck and it's a great movie.  Yeah, so he wants to be friends.  And I told him, all right, but can I break it?  What the fuck is this really about?  It's not about dumb pizza.  It's really about that I'm an asshole.  Here's the thing.  Are you an asshole on sex?  I really am an asshole, but it's my sense of humor.  And I feel like my friends will know that. 
[03:25:30]  And I also, and you know, his problem was that I disrespected him, which I didn't, I  didn't know that I was going into a situation where I had to see Joe DeRosa as a different  person.  Right.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, I thought I got to be myself and he got to be himself.  I didn't realize like from the jump, we're going to.  Well, I got, I got experience.  I mean, I did one with him and I'm like, wow, that's the same Joe that comes on our show.  Holy fuck.  Who do you, why do you think it's sexual tension?  That's what you said.  It's obvious.  I don't know. 
[03:26:00]  Bonnie's a good looking lady.  Come on.  Joe likes old ladies.  Oh, what?  Oops.  I mean, that's two for two.  No, but he's in, he's definitely intense on the set.  I showed up unprepared.  I don't think I've ever told this on the air because he changed the script and stuff.  And I'm like, ah, you know what?  I'll just go there and wing it.  And I didn't realize like this was a real fucking thing.  Sound guy, light guy.  It's like people, you have to fucking, you know, fill out forms. 
[03:26:30]  And he looks at me and I'm like, what?  I thought we were just wing it.  So for half of my shoot, we were practicing lines in the hallway until I got it right.  Because you guys were just thinking it's like a three minute YouTube video.  Like some of the dumb stuff I do.  I'm like, oh, he's doing one of my dumb things.  But it's his thing.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  When he was yelling at me, he's like, I do stuff.  I make things.  What?  I was like, I was like.  He looked at me like he knew he couldn't tell me off, I guess.  He could have.  But I guess because of the show or whatever. 
[03:27:00]  Right.  But I could see in his eyes.  You're holding something a little more important than I am.  I'll get my husband to talk to you.  I could see in his eyes.  I could see in his eyes.  He wanted to probably fire me or tell me off.  He called me, but it's weird.  I'm friends with him.  I'm friends with him.  You know, when he called, I go, look, I got to start with my wife.  But I said no.  I was crying when I called Rich to tell him.  And he goes, oh, come on.  You're an asshole, too.  I didn't say that when you were crying.  I thought you were crying.  No.  Because it was. 
[03:27:30]  It's emotional.  It was hard to take someone telling you.  So, I mean, I didn't know that everyone thought I was an asshole on either shoot, by the way.  I mean, I didn't realize that my personality was toxic.  But Rich, you didn't know he was a director.  What does she act like on these sets?  I'm not on the show with her.  But I know Bonnie.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Is it nervous energy?  No, Bonnie's a funny person.  She's funny anywhere.  No, no, no.  I'm just fucking around.  So then why wouldn't you pick up on that because you guys have been around forever?  It would be like if when I come in here and I sometimes I'll make fun of you guys a little bit or whatever. 
[03:28:00]  Or like you're like, hey, you're disrespecting me.  We wouldn't say that.  You know, it's like I have to be careful sometimes I don't.  But we wouldn't say that.  No, you guys wouldn't, but I'm saying.  He did.  Some people have an issue with, you know, that I don't give the right amount of weight to things.  It's a comedian.  Respect.  No.  Bonnie, that's why I'm trying to jump in here a lot because I've seen it a few times now.  He really wants to be like a director.  Yeah, but there's other ways to be a director.  Yeah, when we directed our movie, when we directed our movie, there was no way. 
[03:28:30]  But he wears different hats.  Yeah, he's a comic and you could go at it with him.  But when he's doing this stuff, he is focused.  But a director can't start pouting over pizza toppings if one of their actors.  No, because he's intense and nervous and wants to make sure it all works out in the end.  He has, to be fair to him.  And he has a lot to worry about.  He has a lot to worry about.  He has to worry about his lines because he's acting.  And he knows how he wants the thing done because he wrote the whole fucking thing.  He's doing it in a very short amount of time. 
[03:29:00]  And then he's picking people he thinks could do the roles.  So it's a lot to worry about.  And then when I show up, I go, oh, uh, and he looked at me like, you don't know your fucking  lines.  I got Bill Burr here.  And I, I, I.  Oh, he said that.  He goes, he goes, I've had Opie in my shit.  I've had Bill Burr in my shit.  Me.  Like, like, I'm like, I'm directed like these are people that I've directed.  Like he had Pacino and fucking Dustin.  Will somebody pick up the hotline in the other room?  Why?  Who is it?  I don't know.  It's just ringing and nobody picks up the phone here.  It might be, um, I could just pick up the hotline. 
[03:29:30]  But now it's now somebody else did.  Because you told him to.  Somebody's got to.  I don't give a fuck who it is.  Pick him up.  But here's the thing I just want to say about it.  Is it, I'm not mad at him for being mad at me for whatever at the shoot.  I apologize for that.  It's, what I am upset with is don't, if you're a friend of mine, you know, then A, you should  probably know a little bit about who I am. 
[03:30:00]  Like as a person, I'm not a person that comes in and shakes people's hands and is completely  appropriate.  Oh, so you are an asshole.  Yeah.  I am an asshole.  Yeah.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  Why would you be an asshole?  It's my sense of humor.  I think it's funny.  You know, I'm not too excited with DeRosa because it's like, I know that, I know how  Bonnie is.  Like, I know you're just trying to be funny and like, I do stuff.  But it's like, remember Patrice was shooting something and he said, after he shot the project,  he goes, oh my God, I've been an asshole.  He goes, anybody on your set who's asking like questions or being that guy is an asshole. 
[03:30:30]  Like he felt bad about the way he had acted on all those sets when he was shooting something.  So Joe's just a new director.  He was probably overreacting, but he's just stressed because he's a new director.  Right.  But my problem is how he went about then afterwards, like trash.  I mean, he gave me a trashing for 20 minutes about my character.  I mean.  But he sets it in a way where you realize quickly you got to take it very seriously. 
[03:31:00]  So when you were messing around with the whole pizza thing, that probably drove him nuts.  I didn't know at that time.  I honestly was not aware that I was.  Well, pizza wasn't in the budget.  Yeah.  But he's also not an experienced enough director.  Like he's done a few things to know how to handle that.  Like, whereas when you're dealing with an actor who wants to do a character their way,  the best way may be to go, oh, let's try a few takes away and see how it works.  But he might not have had enough experience to do that.  So he might have just panicked a little bit.  I did one with him and it went really well.  Yeah.  He's a nerd.  Oh, well, you and him are fucking lovers. 
[03:31:30]  Isn't that wonderful?  But mine went well also.  So maybe Bonnie is the problem.  Well, I mean, I saw it.  I'm not saying I'm not the problem.  That's the whole point.  I'm not saying that.  I completely.  I'm saying that I could.  I really.  Believe me, I know from past experience that I tend to rub people the wrong way.  It happens, you know, and I don't know that it's happening a lot of times until I'm in too deep.  I got enough info.  Okay.  Joe's a nervous Nelly.  He wants everything to work out. 
[03:32:00]  I'm serious.  Work out well.  He's controlling.  You show up on the set.  He is really nervous because he wants everything to work.  He wants.  He wrote the script.  He wants.  He has the vision and he wants everyone to take it seriously as well.  Bonnie taking it seriously, but comes across like she's not.  Yeah.  Like I had my lines memorized.  But he should have realized it's just Bonnie being Bonnie and that she is taking his project  seriously in the end.  But what did he get inside and said something to you and said, hey, look, I'm a little nervous.  Can we, you know.  Right.  He should have talked to you privately instead of having a blow up in front of people. 
[03:32:30]  Right.  Did you ever get the peppers and onions?  We did.  And then I spilled it on the floor.  Oh, I thought it was just a regular pizza.  Okay.  All right, guys, I added nothing.  Take care.  Okay.  Bye-bye, Jimmy.  Bye-bye.  But why during all of this would you look at me and go, sexual tension?  Why would you say to me?  Oh, thank you, though.  Just to fuck with your head.  No, yeah.  Why would you do that?  Why do you like...  You don't fuck with him when you do that.  You fuck with me.  Did you see Brian Regan rubbing her arm?  I don't mind Brian Regan.  Why are you doing this?  Brian Regan's a big headliner.  I noticed that.  He has a tour bus. 
[03:33:00]  And he was like, you know, if you get rid of him, wake, wake.  Are you kidding me?  It all went down.  I almost gave Brian her number.  And he was making believe he was giving Bonnie a phone number.  But he really gave me a phone number.  And he did it in such a way like, look, I'm not kidding.  But I got to make believe I'm kidding in front of him.  It doesn't matter.  See, I can't...  But the Joe Rose's sexual tension bothers you?  No, I can't control other people.  I can't control her.  I can't control...  I've given up.  It's a very healthy attitude.  I let go and I let God.  People do what they want to do.  First of all, you know, can I just...  Look, I respect you and I think that you are right on a lot of things. 
[03:33:30]  Psychologically, you break stuff down very well.  But sexual tension is not always the case in every guy, girl.  Well...  How's the fuck with him?  Yeah, but it doesn't.  Because then later, you know, he's yelling at me.  Is that real with him?  Yes, it's real.  No, no.  Let it go.  It's not real.  Don't...  Let's not turn this into me.  She's having a fight with the road show.  She's telling me it's real.  And you asked me why the sexual tension.  So somewhere in your head, you think it's real.  Well, listen...  I'm playing off what you said. 
[03:34:00]  Listen, doctor.  All I'm saying...  What?  That's what I live with, man.  That's what I live with.  Holy fuck.  Is it any wonder I go to places and act like an asshole?  When you ask me if they're...  What do you mean by sexual tension?  You meant that.  No, I'm saying why you said that just to fuck with me.  That's what I said.  He keeps bringing it back.  But you meant why you think sexual tension...  Yeah, in his head, he's like, did they have sex?  And you weren't going for the joke or any of that shit.  You really were trying to, you know, pick my brain over it.  Not your brain.  And the only reason I said it was to fuck with you.  I just got a real text from Norton. 
[03:34:30]  He said, I saw Brian slipper his number outside the studio.  So.  Rich, what's up, man?  Nothing.  What's up with that?  You know, I got a question.  And he does keep bringing it back to that.  You mentioned that, like, at the beginning of the story.  And then we move on from that.  And Rich brings it back.  Listen, I know it's your hour.  But you shouldn't be talking this morning.  I would never sleep with DeRosa.  I don't like this.  Take me seriously, Rich.  This is my hour.  And I see it going a certain way.  Don't insult me.  Officially, it's not your hour.  Don't help me.  Stop.  You're insulting me, too.  Officially, it's not your hour. 
[03:35:00]  I need to be respected.  I've decided that I...  Can we get a pizza?  No, Bonnie!  We're not getting pizza!  I got a trip to L.A., so I've got to waste some time.  Oh, can I just add one more thing?  Yes.  Joe was late to the shoot.  What?  His own shoot?  Yes.  And you're not taking it seriously.  And I didn't bring it up in the phone call or anything.  Where's Joe?  He doesn't take my hour seriously.  He hasn't showed up yet.  Yeah, he's late.  He's a chronically...  Does he know you guys are here and he's not going to show up?  I don't know.  I'm friends, you know what I mean.  He called yesterday, and I meant to text him.  Thanks.  We're all friends. 
[03:35:30]  I didn't, too.  By the way, you were great in that short.  I was?  Yeah, I thought so.  You didn't watch it?  Did you not watch it out of spite?  No, no, because I thought I was overacting at that point when he kept saying, be angrier,  be angrier.  I felt like I was just like in a silent movie walking around.  You know?  Now everyone's got to check it out just to see.  Now that they know what was going on behind the scenes.  What's it called?  What are you waiting for?  What are we waiting for?  Warner Sound, I think.  Yeah, Warner Sound.  Just the Metallica.  YouTube channel, Warner Sound.  It's one where they're going to a concert. 
[03:36:00]  Not that one.  The other one where they're waiting to go to a concert.  It's all his movies about concerts.  It was the theme for this little series.  Oh, okay.  I saw him in Norton.  I saw him in Norton's one.  See, but I'm fucking around.  I don't mean that.  It was any malice.  I was at the backstage door for Sheryl Crow.  That's what I played.  Oh.  And then Norton was for Cat Williams.  Cat Williams.  That's the one I saw.  And then there was one for Lindsey Buckingham, Metallica, and Ant did one, Phil Collins. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  He's directed all those people.  I should have probably taken it a little more.  I should have been a little.  That's really his thing, though, man.  He wants to do that shit.  Bill Burr!  For a part.  I directed!  You see how fucking great Bill Burr was in Breaking Bad?  He's fucking good in it, man.  He's going to have a fucking career out there.  Big time.  He doesn't have to.  As a comic, he has a career.  I wrote him off early on, you know.  I was like, I remember seeing him, and I'm like, no.  This guy's never going to make it. 
[03:37:00]  Done.  Wow, Bondi's an asshole.  I really was wrong.  She's an asshole, right?  He's one of my favorite comedians in the world.  No, I know, but I'm just going back to the asshole.  I didn't say that to people.  I didn't walk around to his audience.  You might as well go home now.  This guy.  We had a meeting with four big NBC executives, and it was so, there was the black lady, the  Asian guy.  I mean, you couldn't get more executive than this meeting.  Benetton.  Like a Benetton ad.  So we're in the meeting.  They walk in.  We introduce, and they said to Bonnie, where are you from? 
[03:37:30]  And the first thing she says to him, my mom's pussy.  That's good.  Not to these people.  I'm a non-median.  No, he's not good.  Oh, you got to read the room?  Not to these people.  I said it with a British accent.  But that's the shit I would do.  That's why I think it's good.  I don't like reading the room.  I like just doing my shit.  Yeah.  And the more uncomfortable I can make someone, the better.  Yeah, but we were trying to situations like that.  Not when you're trying to sell a show.  I called the boss an asshole the other day. 
[03:38:00]  You already have a show, though.  Exactly.  He gave you the contract, and then you called him an asshole.  Yeah, you can make the contract, I would assume, right?  No, you can't just be like, oh, well, now you call me an asshole.  You're not going to be here for the next couple of years.  Yeah, you can't do that.  That guy doesn't work in court.  What did I say?  Louis C.K. was in here, and he was outside the studio waiting to try to pitch Louis C.K.  to do some satellite radio or something.  I'm like, oh, that guy's here.  It'll be a complete waste of time.  Yeah, but that's also your thing.  You're an outrageous shock jock.  No, I'm not a shock jock.  You insult the bosses?  We don't like that label anymore. 
[03:38:30]  That's a dumb label.  They did that when they were back in the morning.  Thank you, Rich.  These guys are fucking radio hosts.  That's all these years.  You finally stick up for them.  When they were back in the morning.  I've been sticking up for you guys on the road for 10 years now.  What road?  I don't need anyone on the road on my side.  I don't see those people.  Who cares?  Yeah, and I don't get to see them either because of you guys.  Who do you stick up?  Nobody.  There's no lying.  I'm not just saying this.  When I'm on the road doing other radio, 9 out of 10 radio hosts go, we love those guys. 
[03:39:00]  Because they can't do what you guys do.  One day they don't have the talent.  No, because we ruined it for everyone.  No, no, they don't have the talent too.  Watch what you're saying.  We started that whole ball rolling.  They can't do it.  That Sex for Sam thing was the big event that really drastically changed radio.  Yeah.  Slowly but surely.  But that's where it began.  All right, we got to hit the counter lines.  What?  We got to test our movie.  I didn't stick around for nothing.  I want the Bonnie-Jota Rosa conflict now.  Yeah, well, if Jota Rosa is here, but... 
[03:39:30]  Because he wants to be a director.  He's disrespecting you.  I want to be a radio show host, right?  Right.  And he's respecting what I...  Never going to happen.  Done.  You're an asshole.  You're never going to be on my show.  Expect a phone call.  What about the girl?  Why don't you bring the girl and guy in at least?  I feel bad.  Bring in Kelly.  Where's Kelly?  No, I don't want Kelly in there.  You know, you insulted her last time.  Bring in Kelly.  Eric, get Kelly in here.  All right, she's like a wannabe.  What are you saying?  This is why people think you're an asshole.  Let's just be mean to her, then.  Yeah, no problem.  Bring her in.  And this is why people think you're an asshole. 
[03:40:00]  I should get her in.  I should get her in.  You're a nice guy, Rich.  Joe.  What's up, man?  Why isn't he doing my show?  Are you coming by the channel?  Because I'm still here.  What's up?  I'm still on the air.  Are you coming by or what?  Sit down, Kelly.  Sit down.  No, I'm going into another meeting.  I was trying to get over there, but I don't think I'm going to make it.  I'm not sure if I'm going to make it or not.  You're still on the air, though?  Yeah, Bonnie told some whacked out story about you. 
[03:40:30]  What did he say?  It wasn't good, man.  What did he say?  What's the story?  Well, Bonnie said that you're really, really hard to work with.  Oh, Jesus.  Bonnie McFarlane?  Yeah.  Summing up.  Yeah, her and...  Okay, you're a fucking rotten laugh.  No, that's me.  Hey, Rich is here and Bonnie's here, and she told a horrific story.  I feel really bad for her.  Don't listen to him.  Don't fall for it.  It's tough.  You know, it's funny, Kofi, that she brings that up on the air. 
[03:41:00]  Because, you know, yesterday I had a caller and tried to say, hey, we haven't talked in  a long time.  Oh, she's not over it.  Hey, you think somebody will call you back after you leave a message like that?  I've been really busy.  I'm sorry.  Joe, she told...  Tell him to call the hotline.  She told that whole story, and trust me, she's not over it.  That's not true.  All right.  Well, guess what?  I'm not over it either.  She's hard to work with.  Why are you doing this?  Hey, Joe, was I easy to work with? 
[03:41:30]  I'm pure breeze.  You know what?  You were a lot of fun.  You were all laughs.  Thank you.  I didn't remember your lines.  I wasn't prepared, though.  You know what?  That didn't matter.  When somebody's got a good attitude, that's all the counts.  What's happening over there, Sam?  Turn it up.  What?  It does really well for you.  Oh, hold on.  Bonnie's playing the message that you left her.  Okay.  Yeah, Joe, can we call you on the hotline and make this easier? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, but I got to go in like two minutes.  All right.  We'll call you right back.  We'll call you right back.  E-Roc, call him right now.  His number is 917.  Don't do it.  What?  What happened?  What happened?  All right.  I hung up on Joe.  Call him back.  Let me hear the message you left, Bonnie.  Okay.  Hey, Bonnie.  It's Joe DeRosa.  I know we haven't spoken in a while.  Put the bottom to the mic.  But I just wanted to call to say that good luck this weekend with the screening. 
[03:42:30]  It's Joe and Rich, and I'm sure it will.  It's a great movie, and I'm really proud of it.  It should be.  It's really good, and I'm proud to be a part of it.  And I just hope everything goes really well.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  Bonnie just played the voicemail you left.  Wait, wait.  You've got to wait until the end.  All right.  Hold on.  We're still listening to it.  I miss being friends with you.  All right.  I miss being friends with you.  See, and I told you, and I said to you that he's reaching out. 
[03:43:00]  Okay?  Obviously, you're my wife, and I'm going to take your side.  But I said he's reaching out, so maybe now it's time to bury the hatchet and mend waste.  In your head.  No.  I don't care.  I don't see it that way.  I don't think the voicemail was sincere.  It was like he was reading.  It was kind of like he was reading.  Actually, I think that it's hard for him.  It would be hard to say that.  You know what?  I was correct.  Hold on a second, guys.  Hey, don't believe what he's saying to you, first of all. 
[03:43:30]  You don't know what I said.  So if you're going to backtrack on it, you know, you should know.  What?  That I fell on the sword.  I said I was an asshole.  She said she was sorry about dripping the peppers on the chair.  I didn't hear that part.  Yes, she did.  Oh, I thought you were just saying that you didn't think I was being sincere in the message.  No, no.  I don't know if you can tell the lady voices from the man voices, but that was O.P.  It's very confusing.  The sirens going out.  Listen, the message was very sincere. 
[03:44:00]  Yes.  I miss Bonnie.  Yawn!  Yawn!  Aw, O.P.  You know, it's the truth.  What do you want from me?  You know, I feel bad about everything.  So you're admitting you were wrong?  But wait, we didn't get Joe's side of the story.  Joe, so what happened on the set?  Because she told her version.  Really quickly, because I know you're going into a meeting.  What happened?  And be honest.  This is what happened.  Bonnie did... 
[03:44:30]  Bonnie spilled some stuff on the chair.  I got upset because it was like the head guy at Warner Brothers' chair.  And I was like, Bonnie, come on, man.  And she kind of like snapped at me a little bit and was like, whatever.  And then she walked out of the room and didn't help me clean it up.  And then I got mad.  See?  I told her exactly.  It's exactly the same story.  I got to take Bonnie's side.  I told the exact same story.  You wound a little tight, Joe, I'm thinking.  How bad could the chair be with the little pizza on it? 
[03:45:00]  It was a fucking velvet chair.  Joe, Joe, I just want to go back a little bit to when I was an asshole asking for peppers  and onions on half of the pizza.  I think you're missing the point, Bonnie.  But, Bonnie, you didn't do it on purpose, right?  I didn't do it on purpose.  All right, Joe, if she didn't do it on purpose, can't you understand that a little bit?  Of course I can.  And it's not like I screamed at her and went, what the fuck? 
[03:45:30]  You made her cry.  You made her cry.  She did cry in the end.  Well, wait a minute.  Bonnie cried two days later when we talked.  Exactly.  She cried at night.  No, that night I didn't really know that it was, like, that bad.  Is that Sam?  Sam, you're really bugging me.  Well, listen, if you would respect me.  Don't disrespect him.  Don't disrespect me.  I'm trying to do a show here.  It's not your show yet.  It is.  Yes, it is.  What the fuck?  I gave you a break and now you're trying to push me out the door?  Go fuck yourself.  He was booked to do my show and he just decided not to show up. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  He was late to his own shoot, too, guys.  It's disrespectful.  He's not going to get back on the after show.  Joe, it seems like you were wound a little too tight.  Joe, I just want to go over one more point.  You had a lot on your mind that day, right?  Now, Opie, Opie, let me ask you this.  Yes.  And I'm not saying this to be provocative anyway.  You were with me that day when we shot.  Oh, no.  You don't want to ask this.  You don't.  Trust me.  No, no, no.  No, no.  I'm not.  No, no.  I wasn't Opie.  Would you say I was wound tight? 
[03:46:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  But there's a lot to think about.  I'm a little stressed.  I said, Joe, I did kind of.  We did.  We all said that.  I kind of stuck up for it.  I said he absolutely is wound a little tight on the set, and he's definitely a different Joe DeRosa.  But I said I respected that because I know he wants it to go well because you wrote it.  It's your vision.  You got other people there that you hired.  I get it.  But, no, my answer was you're wound a little tight.  Well, no, and Bonnie agreed with him.  And then on top of it, you got to act out your part of the whole thing, too. 
[03:47:00]  Here's the thing, Joe.  Here's the thing.  And Bonnie agreed with that, too, that you're stressed out.  It's a lot of pressure.  But say you hired an actor, just a regular actor, to lead in one of your shorts that are great.  And that actor didn't come prepared and didn't know their lines.  You would fucking lay into them like no tomorrow.  But being that it's Opie and he has the Opie and Anthony radio show, you didn't go after him like that. 
[03:47:30]  So what I'm.  But hold on.  So with Bonnie, you know Bonnie's an ass from Jump Street.  So you should have realized that's her character.  She's just trying to have fun to play with her.  What?  Rich, first of all, let me let me let me swat down your first statement because we didn't yell at you when you didn't know any of your fucking lines on the cheap set.  Oh, first of all, I didn't have a line.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  First of all, I didn't have a line.  Yeah, first of all, Joe, you had 18 people cancel before you got rich. 
[03:48:00]  Okay.  Second of all, I didn't have a line.  She told me to ad lib it.  But go ahead.  But my point is that I didn't like, the one thing you're, I'm joking with you about the cheap thing.  Oh.  The thing that I can't agree with you about.  You should see Bonnie's face because she doesn't look at, she's not looking at it like it's a joke.  Go ahead.  No, no, I'm used to, I'm used to a more funny, funny kind of joke.  No, I like talking to Joe.  Me and Joe talk things out.  Go ahead.  Let me hear what you say. 
[03:48:30]  But Rich, you said I wouldn't lay into anybody.  I didn't lay into Bonnie.  We got off on the wrong foot.  I got mad at something she did.  And then I felt like there was this weird tension and she was being like shitty to me.  Two days later that I didn't, we didn't even talk.  But I don't know why he thought there was anything going on.  There was no, not one bit of communication on my part to say, hey, you're an asshole or whatever.  You just sat in your apartment and stewed until you picked up the phone and said, 
[03:49:00]  I have to tell you every, I have to get this off my chest to make me feel better.  Bonnie, Bonnie, that's not, that's not true.  What I did was I sat and tried to wait until I was level-headed enough to talk to you about it.  And unfortunately it didn't go well.  But what I wasn't going to do was call a friend when I was at the height of anger.  Well, you shouldn't have.  You shouldn't have called at all.  I don't agree with that.  No, it is true.  Because you know why, Joe, we're not married.  We're not fucking. 
[03:49:30]  We're not.  There's no reason to have this kind of relationship where we have to get along on every single level.  At some point you have to go, hey, you did it out of selfishness.  You did it because you wanted to get it off your chest and you wanted to let me know.  Rich does it all the time too.  It might be a guy thing where you need to unload.  Don't pull me in on this.  Hold on.  I got to say this.  Here we go.  Stop talking, Bonnie.  I'm going to trash you now for 20 minutes.  No, Bonnie, I don't agree with what you're saying and I'm offended by it. 
[03:50:00]  I love that guy.  This is exactly how the conversation went, by the way.  Now I can leave, Sam.  Now I can leave.  Bonnie.  Bonnie.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Bonnie.  Yeah.  Honestly, quite frankly, I called you yesterday to try to smooth things over and instead of calling you back, call me back like a friend and talking to me about it, you just go on the radio and try to make a bit out of it and then start acting like you were in no way wrong in this situation.  That's not what I said.  That's not what happened at all.  She apologized for the pizza.  Joe, I did tell her to take it a little more seriously than she was, I must say. 
[03:50:30]  All right, all right, all right.  I did try because I'm like, whoa, you're not taking this seriously.  All right.  Thank you.  And Bonnie didn't try to.  You're welcome, Joe.  Joe, I don't have a problem with you being mad at me.  I don't have a problem with you telling me that I was a jackass.  What I have a problem with is that you felt the need for some reason to go over every fucking flaw that I have on that phone call.  You asked me to, Bonnie. 
[03:51:00]  No, I absolutely did not.  I couldn't get you to get off the phone.  I begged you to stop.  That's not true, Joe.  That's not true.  Verbatim, your exact words to me were, Joe, I don't know what I did to piss you off, so I want you to go through it and tell me exactly what I did.  You said that to me.  That's ridiculous.  I said, all right, Bonnie, if you want me to, I will.  And I started with the stupid pizza thing, and you got really hung up on it.  And I was like, Bonnie, it's not about the pizza.  And you're like, well, why are you bringing it up?  And I'm like, because you asked me to tell you exactly what we did that will happen.  Sounds annoying. 
[03:51:30]  But wait, but here's the thing, Joe.  I asked, I begged him to stop.  And then I did say, are you sure you want to do this?  You went for it.  And the other thing is that I need to know, did everyone hate me on the cheat set, and did everyone hate me on the whatever the other thing was called?  No, nobody hated you on the cheat set.  Nobody hated you on the what are we waiting for set.  I plan on making everybody on my next set hate you, even though you're not a part of it.  Am I part of the next project, Joe DeRosa? 
[03:52:00]  No, hey, Joe, Bonnie didn't.  Hold on, I want to know if I'm part of the next project.  Oh, of course you are.  Rich, I got a nice part for you.  Wait, listen, Joe, Bonnie didn't try to make a bit out of this on radio.  So, Opie, who has no material left for the day, saw an opportunity to get to, all right?  Okay, so you know how Opie, who instigates, Bonnie didn't even want to tell the story.  Bonnie said one little thing, and then Opie.  I said he apologized.  I didn't have time to get back to him yet. 
[03:52:30]  Joe, maybe she didn't want to tell the story, but she was telling the story within 15 seconds.  No.  Okay.  I heard there was a problem.  He said, what did you do?  I said, I was an asshole on his set.  Okay, I think this is headed towards the right direction.  That's all I see.  It is.  I'm probably never going to talk to you again, but thank you for that message.  Wow, you guys really are not friends anymore.  No, Joe, no.  It's hard to be friends with someone when they trash you like that.  It's hard to go back.  It's like, I was crying on the phone call, and he wouldn't stop.  It was like this thing in him that he had to get it out. 
[03:53:00]  Joe, you hate women?  When you started crying, Bonnie, when you started crying, I was like, Bonnie, please stop crying.  Come on, I'm sorry.  And you wouldn't listen to me.  Because she was crying.  Don't you understand?  I told you to stop.  No, I do this with my baby all the time.  I say, hey, come on, stop.  When women get to a point, they're crying.  They're not listening to anything.  They got to go through their thing.  All right, well.  Don't make this a gender thing.  I mean.  Well, it's been my experience. 
[03:53:30]  Well, I don't cry like that.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  Me and Bonnie are not friends anymore.  Hey, Joe, are you coming tomorrow or are you out of town?  Oh, we cut you out of the movie.  No.  Are you coming tomorrow?  I'm going to try to stop by, but I'm out of town.  I'm going to try to get back.  That's going to get off.  You're out of town.  You're in Nyack.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to try to get back down here for you.  Oh, Joe DeRose is at Levity Live.  He's at Levity Live.  It's a great little club up there in West Nyack.  It's not a little club.  I just say little club as a thing, not meaning it's a little club. 
[03:54:00]  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Good luck on your audition.  Joe, I'm sorry it got to this point, man.  I was trying to smooth things over.  Oh, my God.  Sure, you're heartbroken, Opie.  How good was I for you in that short?  Let's bring it back to me for a second.  Listen, Opie, you were great.  I'm going to bring your name up in this meeting I'm about to go into.  I'm going to tell him what a good job you did.  Oh, yeah.  I'd love to show you some acting words.  Really?  Yeah.  It's going to help you, not him.  Bobby's going to go, I know. 
[03:54:30]  All right, Joe.  You really have a part for me?  You have a part?  Not really.  Yes, I do.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  Bye.  Wait, that means you don't have a part for me for real.  I'm not a lead.  I got two parts.  You got two parts?  I'm not a lead.  All right, Joe.  I got you in here.  Good luck with the meeting and Levity Live this weekend.  Wes Nyack.  Joe DeRozio.  I invited her here.  But who said bring her in?  She's sitting out there.  All right.  You and I both.  I'm the nice guys.  She brought her friend, right?  Because she brought her friend from Australia to make it look like she's doing something.  No, that's Nick from Australia.  Yeah. 
[03:55:00]  I met him the other night.  Nick is famous.  And she brought him.  Is he famous in Australia?  No.  We just know him around the O&M world.  So here's the thing.  She brought him here to make her look like she's really doing stuff in New York now.  And she's standing in the hallway.  So that's why I believe I'm not getting in.  I got her in here so it doesn't make her look bad.  When he goes back to Australia, he's going to go, yeah, she does radio and everything.  You guys are trying to judge a raise to me.  I didn't even know he was in studio.  That's how unimportant he is.  What do you mean? 
[03:55:30]  That's Nick from Australia.  I love Nick.  I know.  Listen, but I felt bad.  Open those.  I felt bad that you were out there.  I like watching the show.  Nobody comes here to watch a fucking dumb show.  Why do you always take shots at Kelly when she's in?  It's not bad.  It's a lot of over talk.  Yeah.  It's just nonsense.  When you open one, they can get another pack.  My job's done here now.  I want to go home.  So now you held us hostage.  Oh, they smell awful.  They're great.  Yeah, just try one.  I'm not even joking.  You got to eat one or two or three or four or five before you really... 
[03:56:00]  They're the seaweed snacks.  Oh, that's the wasabi one.  That's too hot.  Oh, don't do the wasabi.  That's the hottest one.  Don't do the...  Oh, those are...  That's the...  You're going to be turned off to them because they're so hot.  Yeah, they're too spicy.  They're good.  Oh, my God.  They smell horrendous.  I think I've tried seaweed snacks somewhere before.  They're not that bad.  What about the roasted...  Garlic?  Sesame...  Yeah, those are good.  Those are good.  Sesame oil?  Yeah, very good.  This is fantastic radio.  Huh?  Korean seaweed snacks. 
[03:56:30]  Let's see.  He's opening it up.  We're never going to make it there and back by the time we're going to go to Caroline's  and come back and do...  Caroline's is right there.  It's literally down the street.  Yeah, but we got to put our movie.  We got to trust the movie.  You have to watch the whole thing.  I'm going to make fun of me.  Hey, don't open both those snacks.  I didn't say you'd get wasabi.  No, come on.  You got to eat a couple.  You got to eat a couple.  I know they're weird at first.  And I like sushi, but no, man.  Oh, they're fucking good.  Can you give me a couple?  Oh, God, no.  Not even...  You got to fold them like this.  Look, look.  It's not folding them. 
[03:57:00]  It's breaking them.  God, no.  Here, take this.  He's just shoving them in his mouth.  He's making seaweed snacks look unhealthy.  I know.  Here's your packaging.  That's gross.  That's gross.  No, after one, I know.  Oh, fuck.  Try one of these.  Which one?  It's a seaweed snack.  It's going to kill you.  It looks like a breast stripe.  Was that the wasabi one?  No, this one isn't.  Couldn't be worse than a Vegemite sandwich.  I'm telling you.  They're great.  Let it melt in your mouth.  Melt?  We good?  I don't really think we're going to ever talk again. 
[03:57:30]  Me and you?  You and I.  All right.  We come from the same place.  We're good, right?  Yeah, we're good.  All right, all right.  Oh, these are gross.  Oh, God.  Yeah, they're disgusting.  Oh, my God.  I'm not going to have one.  It says we're St. Piper.  All right, Samba.  All right.  It's all yours.  You're going to L.A.?  Yeah.  For this TV thing?  Yeah.  I want to know more about the TV thing.  I want to know more about this O&A tour bus.  Oh.  Well, the tour bus, supposedly they're getting us John Madden's bus, and we're going to fucking  hit a bunch of cities in one week.  Am I on it? 
[03:58:00]  No.  That'd be cool if we could bring some of you guys along.  Is that the reason you said, hey, you guys stay, you could plug your movie one more time?  I tried.  I tried.  Caroline's.  Go to carolines.com.  Click on November 10th.  Click on the link.  You can buy tickets right there on the website.  One o'clock tomorrow, Caroline's.  1 p.m.  1 p.m.  I would hope a lot of people go there.  Next week, bananas.  Do they have to pay at the door tomorrow?  They have to pay at the door.  How much?  It's $15.  Stop crunching the seaweed on the money.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  It's worth it.  There's going to be a lot of people there. 
[03:58:30]  Susie Espin's going to be on the panel.  I've been involved off and on with this movie for fucking three years.  You were the first guy we talked about it from the beginning.  But I think it came out great.  Women aren't funny.  1 o'clock tomorrow, Caroline's.  There's little seaweed pieces on your lip.  It's gross.  Did you call Roger Moore Ron Moore?  No, I called him Roger.  He loved me.  But he corrected you, and I looked at Sam.  I'm like, did he just say Ron?  No, he said, can I call you Roger?  He goes, Mr. Moore, and he goes, Roger. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, okay.  That's right.  Great appearance by you two today.  Thank you.  It was terrific.  Always fun.  Thank you.  And the L.A. thing, I don't know.  I'll ask you about it on Monday.  Send some mean Twitter so you can be blocked, you fucking idiots.  Jesus.  Now they'll send, why are you calling them idiots?  They should send mean Twitter.  And then they send to me, they're like, can you get your husband to unblock me?  I'm just kidding.  All right.  All right.  Have a good trip.  Go see you.  Why would you wait and do it on Mike and Aunt Kelly? 
[03:59:30]  Trying to impress her in front of NAMM.  I didn't do it on Kelly.  Why didn't you talk?  Because you were taking shots at her the whole time, just like last time.  Why did you take shots at her?  I don't know what she does.  She's a comedian.  I'm not going to interrupt when Joe and Bonnie are like going.  Did I ever see you live?  Maybe.  She's good.  She's funny.  I saw her once.  She has an accent.  Bye, Opie.  See you later, mate.  She's just waiting for you to go so she can feel comfortable with you.  I know.  That's why I'm sticking around.  Remember I said uncomfortableness? 
[04:00:00]  Love it.  It's not right.  Have a great trip, though.  Hey, listen.  This radio show is going to be a blast, I bet.  Why would you disrespect me on your way out?  I'm saying it's going to be a blast.  Yeah, well, I'll bet your movie is going to be awesome.  It's going to be a blast.  How does that feel?  It feels great.  I know it is.  You don't know what you got.  What?  Try to finish the sentence.  Yeah, until next Wednesday.  All right.  Goodbye and see us.  That's right, man.  Why is he talking to Opie on Mike and Opie's not on Mike?  Don't get near a microphone, Nick. 
[04:00:30]  Kelly, if you ask any woman what the best gift that she ever got was,  I want to say diamonds.  Yeah, without question, without hesitation, without even thinking about it,  she'll always say, and you remember this, Nick, it's her engagement ring.  The one thing that I did, it says the one thing that I did right besides marry my wife,  but it's just so corny.  That's the most serious.  I would never say that.  I've done a lot of things right.  Yeah.  I guess marrying my wife remains to be seen because it may end in divorce.  Most marriages do.  But I did do a good job of getting her an engagement ring. 
[04:01:00]  It's so important.  It's not just a ring.  It's not just a sign of affection.  It's everything, Nick.  It's everything.  Oh, okay.  Pay attention to what I'm saying.  Pressure's on.  Yes.  Every time she washes her hands.  Every time someone at the store hands her change, you get credit.  Every time she shows her friends, you get credit.  You get credit for that ring every day.  So it's got to be perfect.  It's got to be perfect.  I'm sorry.  Just because nobody has proposed to you and you don't understand the feeling of joy that  comes.  Because I haven't made the right decision yet, apparently.

[04:02:00]  Remember that, Nick, okay?  Sounds like a good block.  You've been with your girl for three years, Nick.  Maybe it's time to fucking...  Fuck that.  Now, Nick, you are the Australian ambassador of the Obie and Anthony show.  You're the one who got the whole country.  I don't know about that.  No?  I certainly help.  I push the word a lot.  Okay.  There's another guy, Steve.  Steve Ward.  Right, of course.  There's two of us.  Nick Cosma as well.  There's three of us.  There's three of us really pushing hard.  Are they all just going nuts right now because you mentioned their names?  Yeah.  Probably jerking off listening to the...  That whole conversation with Joe DeRosa, I'll tell you why it bugged me. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  Because Opie's over here going like, no, you don't understand.  He wants to be a director, so he takes this seriously, so he expects people to respect  what he does.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, I'm trying to host a show.  Yeah.  Your show.  My show.  Yeah.  Roland tells me yesterday Joe DeRosa and Kelly are going to be on the show.  I go, okay, just make sure they know they're both coming in case one of them feels weird  about promoting gigs at the same time as the other one.  And it doesn't even matter that we're at the stand tonight through Sunday. 
[04:03:00]  You're going to be there too, Nick?  Yeah.  Incredible.  Then.  That's one thing I've learned from Norton in the last six years.  Sneak him in when you can.  Then we get Joe DeRosa on the phone and he goes, yeah, you know, I don't think I'm going  to make it in.  We called him.  He didn't even cancel.  He just didn't show up.  I'm sorry, Sam.  When were you going to know that your guest that you booked to do him a favor was not  going to turn up?  How's this?  I wasn't even booked and I turned up.  And you got here. 
[04:03:30]  That's a 20 hour flight.  Last time Joe DeRosa was on, this was his question to me.  He looked at me and he goes, what do you do here, Sam?  Now, if I was on one of these little webisodes that he's doing for YouTube and I said, and  Joe's sitting there going like, okay, you stand there and you say this like that.  And I was like, Joe, what do you do here?  What do you do here, Joe?  Based on the story that Bonnie McFarlane told, I think Joe would be very upset by that.  You would have been banned from the set. 
[04:04:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  So how can he come in here and treat people the way he treats me and expect?  Well, he didn't even come in.  That's even more disrespectful.  You're right.  He called in.  You're right, Nate.  Rude.  No, no, no.  We called him.  They called him.  Oh, wow.  He didn't even call in.  Yeah.  Wow.  He didn't even lose minutes.  He expects.  That's right.  Incoming calls are free.  Wow.  He expects to be treated a certain way, but he doesn't have to treat other people that  way.  Wow.  That's all I can say.  Wow.  I don't think he's not coming back on the after show. 
[04:04:30]  That's for sure.  I like Steven Singer a lot more than Joe DeRosa.  Nick, you're welcome back on the after show.  Kelly, one of these days you're going to come on the after show and you're actually going  to get to do the show like proper.  That's okay.  But I'm scared that Opie hates me.  Why does he keep taking shots at you?  I don't know.  Like last time.  He took some shots at me last time.  And it was like, oh, Opie's just being Opie.  And you even said that.  Opie's just being Opie.  Like he's just goofing.  Yeah.  Because he'd met me before.  We had like a long conversation.  But then today he's saying, don't bring her in. 
[04:05:00]  And I'm like, I'm just watching.  We're happy to watch the show.  We're like, oh, this is awesome.  You know?  Like, well, we're talking to E-Rock and blah, blah, blah.  That couldn't have been great.  No.  He's not an exciting guy.  But when I hear him going, don't let her in.  I'm like, well, I won't come in.  But everyone else is like, let her in.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  And then you get in and he's like, who's that?  What did she do?  And then he asked the question.  What did she do?  That's a disrespectful question.  God damn it.  Oh, man.  I know one thing Kelly does.  She's hosting our shows at The Stand tonight through Sunday. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, and where is The Stand?  He's 20th and 3rd.  Have they contact The Stand?  TheStandNYC.com.  Oh.  Roland.  Joe DeRosa can't do the average.  There he is.  Hey, man.  Go see Richard's film.  Go see Bond Skyfall.  You'd save much better spending your $12.  What's your problem with Voss?  I don't know if he touched my Bond posters.  You got a little irritated with Voss today.  But did you hear me, though?  DeRosa's not.  He's banned.  Is he banned?  Yep.  If he texts you and he says, hey, I got a gig to promote. 
[04:06:00]  I know O&A are busy.  Can I come on the after show?  I don't want you to look like the bad guy.  Just tell him Sam says nothing.  Don't you have to be mean to a person?  Huh?  To be mean to a person?  Yes, you do, Roland.  I love it.  That's your assignment.  I have a hard on.  Yeah.  And you're mad at Voss because he touched your Roger Moore Bond book.  Well, he goes, who are these?  I said, put them the fuck down.  They're not yours.  That seems superficial.  Do you leave his greasy fingerprints all over the places?  That's what I don't want.  Because the way he grabbed you, you're like, what's this?  Like a piece of paper. 
[04:06:30]  Oily seaweed stick fucking fingertips.  If that was Jimmy's thing, I think he would snap back too.  Maybe he's just doing it for your birthday, Roland.  Oh, thank you.  Happy birthday, by the way.  Well, he originally wished me happy birthday.  He didn't.  I did earlier today.  Did Joe DeRosa wish you happy birthday?  Happy birthday, baby.  No, I doubt that DeRosa did.  Or for a birthday wish, because he's skyfall.  I mean, think about it this way.  Someone would have called DeRosa and said, make sure you really wish Roland a happy birthday.  Kelly and Nick in here, very respectful.  We've had Bob Kelly in. 
[04:07:00]  Jay Moore was in here yesterday.  Eric, what did Jay Moore say about this show yesterday?  How fucking awesome it is.  It's Jay Moore.  Jay Moors.  Right.  We've had Jesse May Peluso.  Jim Norton.  Tom Papa's been in here.  Everybody's respectful when they come in.  Everybody's like, Sam's doing his show.  I know it's new, but let's give it a chance.  Russell Peters.  He goes, Sam, good to see you.  Blah, blah, blah.  Apparently Joe DeRosa's too famous, right?  Right.  Oh, Gervais was nice to us, too.  Ricky Gervais. 
[04:07:30]  Louis C.K.  You know?  Come on.  Me and Jim Norton interviewed Ricky Gervais, and Ricky Gervais is like, hey, I had a great  time with you guys.  He's not like, what do you do?  You know?  Because I'd be like, Ricky, you don't have to be disrespectful.  Does Gervais have webisodes out there?  That's true.  That's a question.  That's a great question.  I don't know why I'm taking on DeRosa for now.  Because you get to go back to Australia.  You have the benefit of the exit strategy.  Just trash him and fucking leave. 
[04:08:00]  There's always drama with DeRosa.  Is it with all comics?  There's always drama with Joe DeRosa.  Because even Ricky on the other end goes, is that guy going to be there?  He's getting into fights with Troy.  He's getting into fights with Bonnie.  He's like, there's always, the last like, several times he's been on, there's always  some kind of drama surrounding him.  And like, I would never, I would never call a person and say, I miss being your friend.  Like, that's not a sentence that would come out of my mouth ever. 
[04:08:30]  It's very effeminate and emotional.  Sounds like a girlfriend.  Right.  You just described him.  You know, his audition now is all fucked up.  What audition?  Because he's got this on his head now.  Oh, he's going to audition right now?  So all that stuff in his head, like, do they hate me?  Do they like me?  And they go, hey Joe.  Well, you know what?  You can go on, whatever the guys that come on before me do for those four hours, Joe DeRosa,  you can feel free to do that with them.  What are their names again?  I don't know. 
[04:09:00]  But.  Flash in the pan.  You won't be back on After Open Anthony Live.  I was, there's a petition.  No.  Who would start the petition?  Oh, well, I guess he won't be back.  You guys are going to, this poor, poor Joe.  What do you mean poor Joe?  He's disrespectful to me.  I don't know.  I just have a feeling that.  I was trying to book a nice show for today and Joe doesn't even show up for it.  God damn it, Sam.  That's just rude.  It's rude, Derek, isn't it?  Very rude.  Not properly.  Or maybe because of Kelly.  Because I told him Kelly's going to be there.  Maybe that's just.  No, no.  I love Joe, but I do have a feeling that maybe some people might attack him on Twitter and I would 
[04:09:30]  be scared that that would happen for him.  Okay, now why would you put that idea into people's heads?  Nick and Kelly will both be at the stand this weekend.  Go check them out.  Regardless of what Roland says, you can check out Voss and Bonnie's movie.  I don't think they've done anything worth our smite.  No, no.  I'm just kidding.  But DeRosa, he's on the shit list.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Happy birthday, Roland.  Happy birthday, Roland.  Happy birthday, Roland.  Kelly, I feel like every time you're on, I tell you, we'll get you on for a real show  next time.  Just happy to get out of the house, mate.  We'll figure it out.  She's like becoming the Matt Damon of your show. 
[04:10:00]  Exactly.  That tells you exactly the level on which this show is.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are next.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
