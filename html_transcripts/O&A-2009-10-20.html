<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic whirlwind of topics, punctuated by frequent profanity, crude humor, and abrupt transitions.  The show began with a lengthy discussion about a recent Yankees game, focusing on managerial decisions regarding Mariano Rivera and Chamberlain, and a debate about baseball strategy, home run celebrations, and fan participation.  Callers contributed their opinions on the game, shared humorous sports-related anecdotes (including one about a field goal kicking injury), and discussed the tomahawk chop's origins.

Next, a listener-submitted picture allegedly showing conjoined twin sisters involved in pornography dominated a significant portion of the show.  The hosts and callers graphically analyzed the image, questioning its authenticity and ultimately concluding it was likely photoshopped.  This was followed by a segment detailing the hostsâ€™ experiences at Big Apple Comic-Con, including awkward interviews with cosplayers dressed as Ice Man, the Joker, and a Ghostbuster. This led to discussions about breast implants, Apple's stock price, a guessing game about swine flu percentages, the death of Vic Mizzy, and criticisms of The Rock's movie "Tooth Fairy" and Hulk Hogan's post-wrestling film career.  The segment also included promotion of Jimmy's stand-up shows and a discussion of suggestions for a Brett Favre welcome-back event in Green Bay, as well as brief mentions of Michelle Obama on Jay Leno and the Oct-a-Mom.

A substantial part of the show focused on accusations of plagiarism against Howard Stern, involving a radio bit about animals picking football games, also used by Jay Leno. This led to a wide-ranging discussion encompassing a caller's story about tic-tac-toe playing chicken in Chinatown, a child's question to President Obama, an audio clip of Hillary Clinton seemingly using a Black accent,  Stern's alleged plagiarism of the reality show concept, a billion-dollar racism lawsuit against a Manhattan nightclub, Reverend Al Sharpton's feud with Rush Limbaugh (specifically concerning the Crown Heights riots), a caller claiming Sharpton demanded $50,000 for a protest, and  a discussion of ass-dancing and a listener's obsession with asses.  Studio guest Joe DeRosa participated in this segment, and Jimmy Norton's upcoming appearances were promoted.  This segment also included a "Jocktober" critique of the San Jose radio show "Bill and Marla," and a listener's story about renting "Night of the Living Dead."

The final segment heavily featured a continued critique of "Bill and Marla," with the hosts playing clips to illustrate their perceived lack of spontaneity and formulaic approach. Joe DeRosa, still in the studio, contributed to the critique with dark humor, including a morbid joke about Bill and Marla's potential replacement.  The hosts discussed their failed attempt to rent *Night of the Living Dead* and their successful Netflix streaming of the film.  The segment concluded with scheduling discussions for the next Opie and Anthony show and promotion of DeRosa's comedy shows.  The entire broadcast was characterized by frequent interruptions, tangents, and sexually explicit and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  hi hey you never know how to start after all these years you never know how to start  uh uh hi hey opian anthony program jim norton here i know you don't want to go with the hack  shit no so you just start talking again hi how are you what happened uh my headphone went crackly  you saw it hold on hold on you just need a little adjustment that was it the little thing was 
[00:00:30]  unscrewed the little adapter was unscrewed um that's a good way to start with one little  mechanical so what time did the yankees game start yesterday uh it was an early start three  3 30 i think 4 10 something like that 4 10 5 when did the game end uh almost nine o'clock at night 
[00:01:00]  did go 11 i remember the game started yeah i left my apartment i went to the gym so i was watching a  little there yeah then i left the gym and i went shopping all over fucking manhattan i had shit to  do yeah watching the game all over the place then i went and got a massage came home had some dinner  and and would continue to watch the same game it seemed to be yeah it was an all day long it was 
[00:01:30]  an all afternoon slash evening affair yeah finally ended with your yankees kind of blowing it with  that pitching change i uh there were a couple of things it's easy to say that because it didn't  work out but yeah you know it's one of those uh monday morning quarterbacks i think they call them  monday morning quarterbacks yeah uh yeah the you know girardi made some questionable pitching changes  and plenty of them jesus christ but you know something maybe i'm old school opie maybe i'm old school 
[00:02:00]  but uh do you have to change a pitcher after like two pitches do you have to then bring him up if one  guy has a little momentum i mean and i understand you know maybe he's facing a lefty or something like  that you know could you just maybe leave him in because he's doing well yeah well you know you bring  up a good point i don't want to do radio forever i think i want a new career i want to be two pitch  guy two pitch guy i want to start but i want to start like getting ready to be a two pitch guy two pitch 
[00:02:30]  guy i'm gonna start training for that how hard could that be all you need is two pitches get two  lousy pitches over the plate that's it i'm two pitch guy two pitch guy how much money do you make to be  two pitch guy i don't know it all depends i bet you could if you're a good two pitch guy i don't even  know if you have to make a lot of money you're you only pitch twice so how can i even tell if you're  only pitch two pitches how can you be good he's a genius or how could you be bad two pitch guy they 
[00:03:00]  love him if one out of my two pitches you know lets up a home run i think i'm still doing good  as two pitch guy two pitch guy it is ridiculous annoying uh yeah he made some questionable uh changes  that and and that that fucking job of chamberlain i don't like this guy i never have i he's not good  he's he's uh uh one of these loose cannons you just don't know when he gets in there how is he not 
[00:03:30]  good if the yankees won 138 games this year you just well you know something he's too pitch guy a lot  of times they'll bring him in sometimes he's good uh a lot of times he stinks the guy stunk last night  and they left him in a little too long it's weird that someone like him warms up forever and then comes  in and just throws a couple pitches and that's it okay well my day's done and then he traveled with  the team for that pulling rivero like that i i well it's just one of those days and that was just on 
[00:04:00]  the pitching side on uh uh on the offensive side they um they couldn't get it together they're  knocking home runs with no one on base you know fucking jeter steps up there a rod had another one  almost had two how many home runs does he have in the playoffs um damon i don't know how many  fucking home runs is at least three right a rod oh at least i think he's got four yeah four in the 
[00:04:30]  playoffs nine rbis wow that kate hudson's a good luck charm huh yeah they show her sitting there but  if if the yankees lose it all then they'll blame kate hudson they'll try to burn her at the stake like  they do with all the other broads i'll be right involved with athletes i'll be right there rah rah in that  one if if they do she has more to lose than anyone else yeah that kate hudson she can either be a hero  or scum another another game though that went into extra innings uh i couldn't stay up for it was uh 
[00:05:00]  did you watch oh yeah yeah i can't i can't not what now i'm at the point where i know i have to do things  around the house so every television has the game on so no matter what room i go into the game is on  so like i was trying to get some stuff done so i had to keep going between the living room and the  office so both of those tvs were on and then when i go downstairs to grab you know beer from the bar  i got the big bar television on too so there's me alone in the house and four tell four televisions 
[00:05:30]  on with the game on that's the way to go though four different rooms not a lot of time for anthony to  get you know anthony no perish the thought i sit in silence and and listen to the voices in my head  that's why i need the tv on yes keep it loud just so you don't even dream some weird shit keep it loud  and you need to figure out i need something to wash away these thoughts uh scott from hobpog writes be a 
[00:06:00]  knuckleball guy yeah maybe i'll be knuckleball guy maybe i take the next year off and just like  practice my knuckleball that's funny and then i'll call all the baseball teams and go okay here i am  i'm a knuckleballer i'm your two-pitch knuckleball guy do they have one of those yet a two-pitch knuckleball  guy i don't think they got two-pitch knuckleball guy why work so hard when you could be a two-pitch  guy or maybe even a a field goal kicker knuckleball i want to be a field goal kicker maybe no why not 
[00:06:30]  that's a special thing that's very hard to do nah how hard could it be how hard we tried you  kicked the ball did we try i almost pulled a charlie brown fell on my ass yeah we were at giant  stadium oh for the xfl thing you still remember that stuff tried kicking i knew damn well that it  seemed it was going to be a lot easier to kick a field goal than it actually was it's like you just  run and then you get your footing right and you kick like you would a can in the yard when you're a  kid fucking hurts nope it hurts your fucking toe too man because you're not supposed to even hit 
[00:07:00]  it with your toe and then you're supposed to hit it with like the top of your foot and the fucking  thing i don't know the thing it rolled on the ground and i think i went right on my ass it was  just uh we didn't have the proper footwear either yeah that's it yeah you know the proper footwear i  want to be side i want to be two-pitch sidearm pitch guy with that wild sidearm pitch it's a little  flip yeah but only two pitches that's it because if you pitch more than two then they know you suck 
[00:07:30]  yeah that's what i'm getting at i think anyone could be two-pitch guy how fast do you have to  throw it to be two-pitch guy how fast do you have to throw the pitch 70 75 miles an hour yeah  because yeah that's all if i took a year off maybe i could throw a ball 70 miles an hour maybe  i'm not even close to be honest who is this guy what sidearm guy this is just a bunch of like  japanese guys japanese sidearm sidearm and submarine pitching yeah the japs where they come 
[00:08:00]  way up from underneath the japs love the sidearm for some reason oh yeah that's a weird thing to  the ball you throw like that it really is screwy because it looks like you're either bringing the  ball depending on what side the batter's hitting from you like ball looks like it's either coming  at you or going away from you how about getting get me some raleigh fingers for pete's sake where's  raleigh fingers i'll get some raleigh fingers i'm gonna break this whole motherfucking room apart  his handlebar moustache his moustache his moustache let's go to jimmy james in new hampshire

[00:24:00]  a game at all he just he just oh you need to catch all right hold on i'll catch you that's it but can  he be uh put in a game nope not at all no for real he can't nope he's not an active player they hired  him look go ahead no i'm sorry you can look him up and all he does is just catch and he's like oh i'm  the i'm the i'm the happiest guy i catch for the match and i don't have to play but i get paid for  it dude let's get that job yeah that's wow see now you're not even affecting the uh the outcome of  the game you're you're running behind you a lot to go fetch the ball but that's kind of i don't 
[00:24:30]  yeah exactly you try to catch some of that shit all right but i gotta go to work man see you guys later  wow this is a pretty good little fucking topic one the one thing even though the uh the yankees lost  last night uh that i did enjoy is the home plate ump he's my favorite why he's guy you just hear him  that's hacked now though the stripes yeah it's great they and they mic'd him so they were like 
[00:25:00]  let's listen to a conversation between uh him and uh posada and he's like so what time did you get in  last night four yeah we got in late got to hotel what time about six yeah yeah we got in pretty late  too that's really yeah yeah that was the conversation for real yeah it was pretty funny that's kind of  cool yeah and then i went uh into room he's screamy guy hey you want to hear a funny joke oh sure 
[00:25:30]  uncle paul when i was young i was never a good baseball player no the position i played was left  out oh uncle paul that is a joke uncle paul would tell let's go to chisel in pittsburgh all the kids  laugh at it chisel hey hey uh during the late 60s the pittsburgh pirates used to have a gimmick 
[00:26:00]  they used to have a thing that was called the green weenie and uh it was about like a 10 inch green  plastic look like it it looked like a sausage but it also looked like a dick but they used to shake at  the the opposing team to bring them bad luck and what better simple could it be if you're shaking your  dick at the competition come on now we're gonna google i think you finally i think we finally  saw it yeah bob prince invented it it was called the green weenie the green weenie would you it is 
[00:26:30]  the truth people from pittsburgh i'm sure are listening and we'll back up on that it's hilarious  you could never get away with it in this day and age would you wave the green weenie if it helped  your yankees won the world series i would not wave the green weenie look at the green weenie  where let me look at this fucking thing oh they look like fucking sex toys that is a dildo oh okay 
[00:27:00]  jesus danny you google image you see all sorts of green weenies  green weenies green weenie well that looks like a sex toy too the actual green weenie  you could chisel having a good time thanks chisel uh there was something fucking else  that's the green weenie you'd shake that at people it does it's bent it's bent up to hit the fucking g 
[00:27:30]  spot and it says official green weenie on the side and it is indeed a green weenie do you guys  remember this is gonna date a lot of people listening and maybe a few in the room the uh the a's  when they were aids the a's when they were when they were doing their world series run they had a  guy on their team maybe we could look him up in the 80s right uh i think we got to go to the 70s  oh wow and uh his his oh his only job was to pinch run who's run 
[00:28:00]  they they actually hired they actually hired a sprinter the a's hired a sprinter i think i  really want to try to if someone has some info on this the guy couldn't fucking hit he he never  played baseball they hired a sprinter and they taught him how to run the bases is it herb washington  i don't know is it herb washington i don't remember his name danny what do you got on herb washington 
[00:28:30]  herb washington became the game's first and only designated runner when the oakland a's maverick  owner blah blah signed the world class sprinter in 1974 i don't know if that's the guy about 74  that's about right that's about right he's a 40-man roster right maybe it made it hard because you  need to lose a pitcher or something to do that so he thought it was important and this guy was  he did but he didn't really know how to run the bases properly he just knew how to sprint and not  slow down he'd go diagonally from first to third he doesn't even know how to play yeah he uh he would 
[00:29:00]  get the second base but the problem was he would overrun it every single fucking time uh let me say  how to dan and holbrook dan hey what's up boys hey uh during last night's game when horary besada  hit the home run in the eighth inning uh a rod went up to jeter and grabbed his ass there's a video on  youtube you can check it out it i it looked to me because i i was reading that also on uh twitter 
[00:29:30]  but it looked like he grabbed the back of his shirt or something but then all i kept hearing was look  he's great he grabbed his ass now there's jeter right all right here comes a rod oh my god what  the hell is that he really did grab his luscious cheeks what is that about like he's just lifting  them up that is a uh an ass grab there really what's going on if he's just lifting them up why don't 
[00:30:00]  we reenact that right now in studio there's not i fuck he he did kind of grab it's um i think he  realized oh shit i'm grabbing a man's ass on tv i'll make believe i'm lifting them up  he's a weird dude look okay he's grabbing look he's having a great fucking postseason for you but  he's a weird fucking dude you know that what's going on in that guy's head uh uh let's go to eric  new jersey eric hey yeah the uh easiest job in sports is a new york island's goaltender you suit 
[00:30:30]  up you don't do anything now that fucking hurts that fucking hurts a lot my friends that's a good  one that fucking hurts uh want to talk to a water boy bill in illinois bill hey hey i was a uh water  boy in college if you lie in illinois okay and uh my senior year they won the big 10 and i got a 
[00:31:00]  fancy little fucking two to three thousand dollar ring for and then fellas pals to wipe their sweaty  balls off with you got a nice check and you didn't do nothing pretty much jack shit yeah i got awesome  seats to a bunch of games and uh you know right i'm not bad off all right on brother that a big  game now that now the pitch runner herb washington leads to this next phone call uh chris in  massachusetts chris how's it going guys hey yeah looked up a few years ago there was it was either 
[00:31:30]  the pirates or the a's hired a midget as a pinch hitter wasn't it uh who it was uh what's his name  is eddie something his name yeah yeah how you remember that guy he played shortstop oh silly  yeah i thought that's been in with the conversation and must have been funny to see  hired a midget because the strike zone was so ridiculous that it fucked the pitchers up yeah  he walked on four balls why aren't teams doing this but the nature yelled strikeout 
[00:32:00]  i think they're not doing it anymore just because the whole 40 man roster thing you don't want to  take up a little spot that's a great that's a great spot to take up you have a midget starting  the game every time he gets on base because you can't strike the little fucker they made a rule  about it and then you get a pinch runner in there yeah they actually did they made a rule no way  and the little people would be all pissed off because they know they did just stop that i want a chance  to be in the major leagues too that looks hysterical it's a little midget look at how high the ball 
[00:32:30]  is it's it's double his height was it the pirates that was the cleveland browns it was in the  50s what's his name cleveland browns that's a football team eddie gaitle that's a football team  they would become the 50s i know i know it's better than a negro i'm sure that's what they  were saying back then all right that's how we start today what happened okay danny's been pulling  up homoerotic uh pictures baseball pictures where you know uh after a play you'll high five somebody 
[00:33:00]  or get a little run right there uh a hug kind of thing but it's it's guys looking lovingly into each  other's eyes grabbing asses uh and stuff like that this guy is just grabbing another one of the  cardinals cocks what is that what is that oh he's grabbing his junk uh suggesting his pal's cup 
[00:33:30]  that's a little weird i'm gonna tweet that one that's that's my first tweet of the day right there  all right why don't we take a break anthony we got the second half of the comic-con uh interviews that  we started yesterday and these are better than the ones we heard yesterday oh and also um i got a  picture to show you what do you remember those pictures i was supposed to be is that don on the  phone you remember the conjoined twins we've been talking about forever which ones the um the little  girls that rode one bike and and swam wait is it the two-headed girl or yeah it's basically a two-headed 
[00:34:00]  girl because they it's two heads two arms two legs and they figured out how to move together so they  could like compete in sports and swim and uh two tits one vagina you remember the only thing was the  weird the big there they are yeah the two heads and the the broad shoulders yeah i was i was sent a  picture yesterday oh i think i know what you're gonna say but don't even don't even show anyone until 
[00:34:30]  after the break nude i just was sent a picture yesterday a little update on these two girls  and i said to the guy i go dude we've been talking about these i don't even know what to call them  forever i think we started talking about them at aaf yeah they're now grown up anthony and i got a  picture an updated picture of them how do they clean in between their two necks they like the floss  yeah they got a floss i was thinking q-tip but floss yeah they have to floss between their necks 
[00:35:00]  maybe they have a neck smell when they're sweating yeah i bet they do because it's just it's too close  together imagine sleeping the one drools on the face of the other one depending on what side  happens all the time i had to get roll over to get comfortable and you the other ones you can't sleep  on your side or no the other one's head is on your face how annoying to have a face near your face  all the time get your face away from me stop it just one yeah you have a greasy cheek your entire  life they do just a lesbo act though they could turn their head can they kiss each other 
[00:35:30]  can they take a breast wing that around i've never even seen each other you think they can't even look  like no you can't turn your neck right i don't know man yeah you can't you know they can't but they  could turn their heads a little toward each other well anthony after the break i have the updated  picture uh that shows what they've been up to lately uh oh i mean 2020 you know all those news  magazine shows whatever have been featuring them forever showing them riding their bike talking 
[00:36:00]  about their dreams and it's great and uh great freak show yeah yeah i've been doing porn how so do i  we'll have a little update on it porno on uh look at them on those two after the break look at their  neck and i hope this picture that was sent to me is real she looks silly we'll explain after the break  opie and anthony heads yeah opie and anthony gonna reveal that picture to anthony in a second here  well we just did a big sports break and i forgot to play this real fast that's a quickie a little 
[00:36:30]  quick hit we like to like to say in the biz yeah here's a quick hit you know to get prepared they  they've got this this ointment in the clubhouse in the training room it's hot bomb so you can put  that on your lower back because i used it all the time for in cold weather i put it on my shoulder  you know occasionally on your elbow just to keep everything warm because if you've had injuries  i think you maybe do you have some on now i just farted that's his own  but anyways what anyway what new but that those are the ways that you can get uh that you can stay 
[00:37:00]  loose is by doing that i'm sorry i didn't mean to stink out there but that's that's that's a good  way of doing it keep yourself warm we guys love farting we love talking about our farts  no one loves being trapped in the room though i i know that from experience that was david wells uh  releasing a silent fart during the mlb coverage on tnt ah nice right he should be fired for that  piggishness yes we might have to break out the george brett clip today oh god him shitting his fans 
[00:37:30]  it's one of my favorites ever oh he's telling that story like you know like it's nothing like it's one of  his greatest baseball games ever let me tell you passion behind that story my pants yeah so anthony  i think we go back about uh i don't know at least 10 years for this story with these uh these girls  yes these freaks the two-headed girl they call her and man they were uh they were all over the tube for  many many years yeah loved doing stories on these two show them swimming and biking and playing sports 
[00:38:00]  and talking about how they just want to be regular teenage girls and someday get married and blah  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah well a few years have gone by and uh a picture popped up on twitter  last night thank you to uh homeless jim i believe on twitter homeless jim i think i think it's homeless jim  yeah and uh he sent me this picture and i'm trying to figure out if it's real but here is your update  anthony danny's gonna show you the picture this is what the girls are up to look that's that's so 
[00:38:30]  fake how do you know it's fake come on come on that cannot be real oh my god wait a minute  that's what we're trying to figure out today we're looking at a picture of the same two girls uh they  have a huge bra on because you can see the bra strap across their really big huge back gotta be a  custom job and one girl is uh blowing a guy i think it's fake it looks like the other one's head 
[00:39:00]  has been photoshopped almost i don't know i can't we can't figure it out a bunch of people have been  trying to figure out if it's photoshopped now i suck at knowing if a picture is fake or not i'm not  even gonna all right i'm not even scroll down a little bit and it's pretty good at this show you  get okay i thought maybe we're gonna get some like is that supposed to be the bra that purple bra that  they're wearing in that picture oh no if that's the case that's ridiculous because i was i thought  because that's gonna be in shorts or something because what where's this picture supposedly 
[00:39:30]  take it doesn't say it doesn't really say um well that's i i mean the side face looks like  it's one of the girls and then the other head is just hanging there odd angle yeah but uh hold on  hold on let me see it's the one on the it's the one on the the left if you're looking at their faces  it's the one stage right if you're her you should look and see if she wears her watch on her right 
[00:40:00]  hand typically this girl has a watch on her right arm look for oh danny what's your uh professional  i don't know i kind of brushed it off as being phony oh one of the first time i saw it i never really  gave it much thought to be honest it's definitely funny the dick in the picture is hard what i mean  why can't a two-headed girl you know give a blowjob but go to homeless gym on twitter if you want to  check out the picture this guy figured out a way to get a lot of followers today homeless gym has the 
[00:40:30]  picture and then if uh there's some people out there that really know they're photoshopping you  know help us out what do you think it's tough right it is tough i have to uh god that is a tough  one let me say that's a i'm trying to find a higher quality higher quality pig come on i got ripped  in four weeks yeah good for you gonna send you to meat spin like i'm trying to see where they would  have done the the addition of the other head right are they known to be a little wild i don't know we 
[00:41:00]  haven't heard from them i need a little backstory yeah we haven't heard about them in a while so i have no  no idea but the picture certainly piqued my interest i'm like whoa well yeah what's up with this the  other one could take over because it's it's one of the jokes we made about them yeah like what would  they do what would they do one head would just sit there and just kind of be bored while while the  she like get pissed if she gets come on her you know like for the other girls doing the job and then 
[00:41:30]  i don't know oh wow that is uh that is perplexing so you're you're not going to officially say it's  fake then huh i'm not you've called out a lot of these pictures over the years and showed us why it  is fake oh i'm not uh i'm not sure someone all right oh kevin from connecticut it's so fake the neck of the  the girl not sucking is a different color and then another guy writes it's real i put it in photoshop 
[00:42:00]  and it's legit jason and pa i think it's fake because i think the angle of the other girl blowing  the girl blow that picture whose head is not up her head's at the wrong angle if it were real don't  you think it would be a bigger story scott and hop hog that's that's a very good question because  these two were very famous for many years all right all right the head looks like hold on hold 
[00:42:30]  on all right i'm seeing a little there is a difference in color between yeah but maybe there's a line up  the back but she's in the foreground god damn that's oh maybe she's closer to the camera light so her  i think the grain is kind of deceptive like yeah it is like i mean they went well pretty they went  low quality to really cover up everybody maybe i mean who's taking pictures with like 35 millimeter  film these days like that's a good point like why why isn't this like a high quality digital picture 
[00:43:00]  i mean obviously this is pretty this is fairly recent within the last couple of years look that girl has  odd with her hand if it's way zoomed in is it possible that would happen if that was taken from  like somewhere else they had to zoom the digital dude something's odd with her arm look at how  our arm and the hand where it meets right there all right look right there not only darker it's bent  weird so maybe it's the girls bending over for something and then they doing something something 
[00:43:30]  else her arm is two different colors yeah oh wait the arm might be the arm is it's not her okay okay  here here yeah look maybe it's the other girl's arm oh no no no not two arms they photoshopped in  the leg isn't theirs either the leg and the arm match color right that right there is blurred look at  the the elbow is smudged to cover up where it was uh roto they rotoscoped right around 
[00:44:00]  fuck anthony look at you we didn't even need gypsy today and then smudged it yeah yeah there's  something fishy going on there different colors i want to know but but they fucked it up with the arm  yeah look at how fat the wrist is compared to the size of the other body so she has elephant  titus for the wrist that could be gay porn that could be like another man giving a guy a handy or  something like that looks zoom in on that hand right on that hand isn't it yeah that looks like 
[00:44:30]  a like a logo on it that's my hand and one of those stud bracelets the other neck the other neck  has smudge marks too smudge covers up you know a world of hurt but you can see it  well uh there's something going on there yeah danny if you go to instant feedback a guy says here is  the link to the original it's fake ah i don't know let's say could be let's say come on we got to get 
[00:45:00]  to the bottom of these things that's what we do we're investigative journalists when it comes to  two-headed chick porno that's right no this kyle uh erwin in michigan okay he's like no man here's  the original picture he's sending it a million times so all right ah  mother fucker let's see they got the original picture why'd they block the penis out 
[00:45:30]  all right what the fuck are they doing all right here's the uh original picture there's the original  yep look the color difference is amazing um oh they're just  fucking with these monsters making it look like they're blowing a guy yeah so they had to oh my  god but thank you to uh kyle erwin i did say that the head looks photoshopped so i get partial credit  yes yes and i'm gonna try this it's b-i-t dot l-y slash the number one t-a-v-a-z 
[00:46:00]  you can see where if you want to see the original picture thank you kyle erwin in michigan  you can see the line on her back where they added on that extra bit of flesh  and they took out the rib and they had to extend the bra and they had to stay the light in the back  of the original girl sucking a delicious penis because  someone's asking is the picture good enough to jerk off 
[00:46:30]  well either one is sure  all right got to the bottom of that one that's it  good we use the power of our audience because yes i knew i knew there were experts out there that  could help us out so i'm sure they're homeless jim yeah you got people talking uh all night long and  this morning but it looks like it's a fake oh that's a shame once again that link is uh uh  no www it starts with b-i-t dot l-y slash the number one capital t-a-v-a capital z 
[00:47:00]  sure everyone got that so a few people will you you watch uh let me say hi to iya  what's your what's your name brother ilia ilia what's up yeah  what's going on man listen this should make some pretty good radio but uh let me tell you  do you really think anybody would want to get blown by a freak yeah yes sure dude not even a 
[00:47:30]  question i would i would do that in a second for the story i have to see what that's all about of  course fuck yeah it might be like uh would that be considered threesome yeah it would be officially  a threesome yeah it would be the two the two two and a half some two and a half some sure are there  any conjoined set uh twins sex uh pictures like real ones oh that's a very good question that's a  job for danny like i don't care yeah you're not gonna find that one you're you're pretty damn good 
[00:48:00]  but you ain't finding that hey danny's good but if it's not on the web i mean you know and what are  these monsters going to do with their lives anyway they should just get naked you know how much money  they would make yeah two-headed naked girl that's four dollars who wouldn't pick up that magazine  just doing featured dancing down at some of those uh strip clubs right bob in jersey bob hey guys uh  just seeing uh maybe if the girl the other one doesn't have a bruise on the side of her head  from getting uh hitting the back of the head with the uh giving a blowjob yeah that must be it

[01:00:30]  just try to make shit up as they would answer so an old guy answers the phone it wasn't and we  decide all right we'll just make believe we're his kids and he was so fucking confused yeah  dude what this is the harrington house yeah i know dad you're coming over oh yeah you're like  down we're coming over yeah that's uh terrible what happened to uncle uh phil and then and he's  going oh really he did he did he rocks gotta find it it's one of those bits that we're taking a 
[01:01:00]  chance because it could be dated and really i don't even care because um i just blurt those lines  out from that call all the time around the house the harrington house yeah somali women whip for  wearing bras what a wonderful country this is bras yeah uh sense yeah this is islamist group uh  is cracking down on residents who do not follow a strict form of sharia and sharia religious rule  okay i didn't know that all right sharia islamic law now publicly whipping women who wear bras 
[01:01:30]  residents tell the paper that gunmen have been gathering women in mogadishu who are perceived to  have firm busts gather them up these women are then publicly whipped by mass men as punishment for  what islamist leaders call deception so they don't like nice firm breasts dude this is fucked up after  the public whippings the women are forced to remove their bras and shake their breasts  oh to loosen them up i get those things sagging now lovely culture yeah it's wonderful so civilized 
[01:02:00]  some woman i can't pronounce her name forced uh says they force us to wear their type of veil and  now they order us to shake our breasts yeah her daughters were whipped for wearing bras they first  banned the former veil and introduced a hard fabric which stands stiffly on women's chest  they are now saying that breasts should be firm naturally or just flat ah well every single one  i've seen in every documentary they have been flat flapjack tits the guys in somalia they have to be 
[01:02:30]  gay yeah to not want the women to look you know oh it's their culture opie you're you're you're just  basing it on our culture oh this group also recently amputated a foot and a hand from two young men  accused of robbery oh they also have banned movies musical ringtones dancing at wedding ceremonies and  playing and playing or watching soccer don't you have to have a fucking phone have a ringtone  what's attractive about being a muslim in in somalia what's the what's the selling point

[01:04:30]  time uh women that have their you know fairly large mouths will speak out against anything we do in  this country but they're silent when it comes to looking out for women in other parts of the world  yeah yeah i always think that too they like uh they just kind of shut off certain areas of the  of the world and say fuck it too you know if shit like that was if the shit like that was happening  somewhere else uh in certain areas that maybe we have relationships with politically and stuff like 
[01:05:00]  that there'd be outrage outrage reverend al is all outraged at fucking rush limbaugh for trying to  fucking go in uh on on buying a football team yet uh women are being smacked around for uh trying to  keep their titties firm and have a clit right imagine we did that in this country if i look at a girl wrong  at work i i i'll i'll be in hr fired you know and then you go to the countries that they do this and  there's no uh there's no voice that's a good job they're all hiding underneath iran how about that we  were talking about the before with the sports how about job the hr guy in somalia yeah that's what 
[01:05:30]  they need i'll send my my hr guy over there oh that's a good one danny you rule we were just looking  at a video of this girl she's young and she's taking off her shirt and now she's got a bra on  and she looks like she has firm d's and then she pulls off the bra and she's sporting like a's a cups  a cups where where can they find this one danny this is a good one for the people out there she 
[01:06:00]  looks great with the bra yeah lots of them too and then wow there is nothing under that a lot of  tweets you're not because i would tweak this shit in a second i think you could probably post a link  to it ah you know what i mean right uh worth getting dutch they have some bras that have like a little  it's almost like a little fake titty inside the bra yeah yeah that's a new thing so what how do they go to  this this is a tough one i have no idea how to tell people how to get it i want to i want to hear 
[01:06:30]  you do it a lot of one person out there will get equal signs because here's the problem i can give  you a website to go to but if you click you get an error and you have to go to like the  i understand the forwarded tent just read this website address okay as best you can all right pay  attention out there everybody pay attention we'll all be quiet you got a pen because you're going to need  total concentration to write this down wait wait no just read it just read it just read it no you  make it no we don't want it easy we don't want it easy that's the bit we've done this before just 
[01:07:00]  all right okay if you want to see a really good video go it is a good video here it goes http  colon okay forward slash forward slash okay post archives dot  and isn't there a way for me just to make it so silly and no one's gonna remember this crap  let me start over http colon forward slash forward slash one word post archives period you think 
[01:07:30]  people would have done something with this they probably find a way a better way to link it that's  e-n-t-e-n-s but they spell it with an e oh it's spelled differently with an e  i-t-y dot net yeah and then there's forward slash zero nine number two five zero nine  slash five zero what zero nine zero nine zero nine two five zero nine right  forward slash image period php question mark pick equal broad dot gif 
[01:08:00]  all right that's enough go ahead for your cyber now everybody can look are you gonna tiny url it  yes you motherfucker tiny url i'm gonna tiny url it what does that mean you don't it takes a big url  and makes it tiny you put any fucking website address in there jimmy and then the tiny urls it's  stunning it's perfect so much fun you got it can you make up your own url name for it yeah okay uh  yeah i think so i think you oh yeah you know what i'll do that i'll make a custom what you're 
[01:08:30]  gonna custom a tiny url you can't do that that's unorthodox my friend oh what are you gonna call it  well if i can let's see if i get that one oh shit yo let me make sure it works oh you can only have  one for all right cool check this out all right this might be a little easier but a tiny url dot com  slash padded bra mother fucker that might be a little easier i doubt it's a great video it really  is that's what the girls are doing she's hot um but we're not whipping the girls for doing that are 
[01:09:00]  we no that's deceiving that's really if anyone should be whipped how depressed would you be if  you brought that out like oh she got and then you're looking for the bed and it's like all right  take a oh i got something yeah we got a few things you have a soundboard on your headboard of your bed  warning yeah oh she's still all right you know you'd still do her you'd be a little disappointed 
[01:09:30]  a little yeah you'd still give it to a good yeah wouldn't you the only reason you brought her home  was because she had the big monsters on her chest and then big flappies fat tits women hate when  you refer to their breasts as big fat tits do you know how hard especially if the woman's your boss  big fat is that is that the fake titty in there yeah they got them yeah it's like a mini silicone it's 
[01:10:00]  a mini boob it's silicone and it's in the bra they do a lot of work those things yeah they really  do they could push up whatever they got into some cleavage and the rest is just deceptive  um plastic fucking apple went up 47 percent dude what the fuck oh no their profits went up their  profits went up and 47 percent from a crazy fucking number to begin with they were 70 something to  share at one point they're like 189 i say it all the time before they announce earnings you should 
[01:10:30]  fucking buy buy buy buy buy yeah but one time you know that's they can't do that forever  uh it's just our luck they have a citadel situation on our hands what's what's pre-market  189 uh pre-come what actually no it's up now oh my god wow look at it go after hours after  hours it's up uh 202 two last last official trade was 189 so it's up why didn't i buy that see it was 
[01:11:00]  one of those deals where it's like ah yeah but it was 70 bucks a share even at a cheap rate so if you  you bought 100 shares it was a seven thousand dollar gamble it's a lot of money you knew back in  like may february march things yeah end of january oh you could have bought it at what uh 78 78 bucks  that's still a lot of fuck that is a lot for a show a lot but wow a fucking apple yeah and it's the  thing it's like you go in the apple store it's mobbed every time you go in there that 
[01:11:30]  fucking store is mobbed yeah because they don't have a lot of stores that's the problem well there's  like two or three in manhattan yeah well there's a fucking starbucks on every corner how about we get  more apple stores right i don't know that's why they're online but that's kind of smart though because  they make it look bigger than life you know what i mean certainly do so when you go to an apple store  there is some business going on people are buying their shit though that's smart they're totally 
[01:12:00]  buying their shit i'm four deep into iphones already yep let's go to matt in boston matt yeah hey i wonder  why it's okay for women to stuff their bras and we're supposed to be all right with that but if i  smuggle a kielbasa in my pants and took my pants off a girl would walk out of them stop smuggling it in the  back yeah it's just looking like you have a big duty in your jeans exactly you have a big greasy  kielbasa stain on the back of your shorts looks like you took a cancer in your pants 
[01:12:30]  holy jesus uh gabe in staten island gabe gabe hey remember that devo hit from the 80s  when a somali comes along you must whip it wow maybe we do a little parody song today yeah  hey hey oh what very good all right uh there was something else something else something else  something fucking else something something call my attention 
[01:13:00]  oh oh yeah the swine flu oh what we're gonna play another guessing game here  percentage of americans this year that will be infected by the swine flu this just came out yesterday  one hundred percent yes it's like captain trips oh wait everyone didn't get that  mm-hmm i got it jimmy no no i mean everyone didn't get that disease in the in the book 
[01:13:30]  or the movie i'm gonna guess one percent up one percent no i my my official guess  is um 12 percent 25 60 no fucking way swine flu will likely infect 60 of americans this year and  vaccine will arrive too late to help most to help most so then you'll have the flu yeah and you'll go  you're gonna have the flu this sucks i feel like shit fuck oh my god it's gonna be the swine flu so you 
[01:14:00]  have a greater chance of possibly dying from it but most likely will not die from it most people  will survive the swine flu they say a few more people die from the swine flu than the regular flu  not like they've been saying in the media like a lot but it's mild i thought it was a milder than  than they thought it was going to be oh really is that what they're saying now yeah and they passed  it on to pigs by the way so now we're gonna have the pig flu yeah it's well it's it's uh it was known  that it could go to pigs but now it's gone to pigs what happened to the bird flu we cured that one 
[01:14:30]  i guess that one never really caught on maybe catches on this year wow imagine having the bird  swine flu bird swine flu could be rough a lot of night cool all right we'll take a break  what's the haps part two yes uh sam was at uh the big apple comic-con did i say that right  in yeah comic-con and uh he said these are the better interviews because he he talked to a lot  of superheroes that were all dressed up all dressed up what a bunch of dorks so we'll get  sam in here next opie and anthony jimmy what are you promoting there buddy oh thanks man um this

[01:27:30]  it's a real fucking movie that looks horrid it's gonna make the rock a very rich man he's gonna  make a lot of rock is already a very rich man or very much doing that it's because that's the  i'm telling you it's gonna be i know he's the new thing in hollywood and he's an old friend of ours  and we wish him nothing but the best but he doesn't have to say yes to everything because  the rock was in no he did that other stupid movie the football dude whatever the movie i don't remember  gridiron gang no gridiron gang gridiron gang you can't handle the tooth yeah this should have been 
[01:28:00]  like a rob schneider movie this absolutely should be a rob schneider movie but they needed star  power to very starring rob schneider and he would just be like the wacky tooth fairy yeah but nobody  would see it if rob schneider were the tooth fairy i bet you with dwayne johnson as the lead  i have no doubt it's gonna do very well but it shouldn't do very well it's horrendous yeah 
[01:28:30]  this concept is horrendous the jokes aren't there and another unfunny billy crystal  it'll be funny if he's giving money only to people who've lost their teeth because of their  methamphetamine addiction like he goes to an australian prison and he just gives gives  money to people with meth mouth rob schneider is the hot chick it's always rob schneider is  is that a movie the hot chick douche yeah wow rob schneider is deuce bigelow male jiggalo they 
[01:29:00]  should just they should just say adam sandler's best friend is the hot chick oh god damn it who's  that other guy that should be doing that movie he had a bomb recently he's an snl uh alum he played  chris kattan chris kattan oh yeah this is a chris kattan movie as well did he have a bomb originally oh boy  did he jimmy i don't even know the name of it oh is that and we made fun of it i don't remember  rob schneider could fake being a hockey player though uh chris kattan no way in hell could you 
[01:29:30]  buy him as a hockey player the rock will do better than both those guys no the rock should be doing  action movies the rock should be cashing in because stallone is is too old he's done  fucking arnold is is the governator i did an impression like uh the the wacky  fucking rocktober jocks yeah uh jocktober excuse me uh and he's like he could fill that void of the 
[01:30:00]  action hero he's pulled it off already he's trying to vin diesel tried to go into the kid the action  guy who's now the kid star yeah that's a good thing follow vin diesel's career but it didn't work  for vin diesel so the rock is filling that role kids movies there's a lot of money in yeah they go  to see it a bunch of times and they buy the dvds there's a lot of that's why eddie murphy's taking  kids movies a lot of money man every kid movie does extremely well because there's not a lot of kid  movies so they just know whatever movies out the parents are going to take their kids to get the dvd 
[01:30:30]  get the toys it's it's a guarantee every time name the last shitty fucking kid movie that didn't  do well at the box office you can't do it but they're gonna make fucking a shitload of money  making action movies maybe not as much here put it this way if i had the chance to do um uh this type  of radio for like 20 million dollars wow or i could do that fucking jocktober type radio for 50 million 
[01:31:00]  dollars i would absolutely do the jocktober type radio yeah yeah as you should find greedy selfish  and different you say someone with morals would you say would like you're not doing it now  that was a dumb example no i would i would take less money i would take less money is 20 million  why would you need 50 million that's what i'm saying you think the rock can't do an action film  and make a fuckload of money but he's got to make these kids shit movies right so he makes a little 
[01:31:30]  more but he's making crappy movies so what was your point you might say i would do this no no  because for me no no i would be i'm kidding my point i was i was joking i'm so lost help me out  i was being sarcastic my point you are i would rather do this type of radio than sit there and  with a hole and do that for more money because it's not like the rock is giving up ten thousand  dollars to make ten million yeah it's all just a ridiculous amount of money it's a ridiculous amount 
[01:32:00]  i got you if he was making an action movie he would still make a fuckload of money right maybe  not as much if he no okay i guess i make two fuck loads of money it's the same thing hey can we throw  cubes doing the same fucking thing the cube ice cube the ice cube i just call him i just call him  the cube you can't call my kids movies though i i had a kids movie that didn't do as well as i had  hope oh really no oh i wrote i wrote one i thought it would be it was about little timothy  where timothy had to uh eckler no no that would be teddy i know i know i thought it was his son or 
[01:32:30]  something no timothy had to bring uh uh a thing of of uh fig newtons to a group of people who were  starting a march for pancreatic cancer and he was afraid he dropped the fig newtons and he was  his job was to bring a bushel of fig newtons to the pancreatic cancer march people 
[01:33:00]  and he tripped and dropped the fig newtons did that cause a problem yes because a car ran over  his hand and the fig newtons crushes little things we got some so the pancreatic cancer march was  canceled because they didn't have yes and then all the people the whole the last 40 minutes of the 
[01:33:30]  movie is a death montage of all the people who could have been saved that would be the most horrific  very good yes it is tuesday two for two oh no we lost the other one all right fine we got some  wisconsin phone calls coming in here let's go to ac ac what do you got well here's the deal a rock  signed a five or seven movie deal with walt disney so that's why he did that uh hunt to which  mountain or whatever it was another deal race race i don't know one of those right that was a remake 
[01:34:00]  yep so we can look forward to five more real shitty uh rock movies three or two three or two  depending on how you do the math that you're in alabama three or four i wish you would reserve  judgment until you've seen them disney movies growing up where that's the bomb man that's that girl from  one um yeah charlie's in the chocolate factory there oh yeah garuga salt  i always loved the grandmother in the original who was in bed yeah it was hot nasty old granny 
[01:34:30]  yeah charlie had the golden ticket and the grandfather sold it to buy a pinch of tobacco  tobacco tobacco backy yeah back to comic-con oh so that's the rock and what he's up to you used to do  our show you used to be a friend of the show well he blew us off i don't know four movies ago wow  oh he's gone now he's a massive success yeah now he's hollering anyone else uh come out of the uh 
[01:35:00]  wwf or slash e and become as big a movie star as the rock guys no no no this is hulk hogan's dream  they live this was hulk hogan's dream is right hulk hogan wanted to be the the tooth fairy i guarantee  he did he left while he was on top and started doing movies but he looks foolish and he can't  act but he can't sing he gets a fucking dance exactly i humble him yes humbled yeah that's a  weird way to humble people there oh yeah there you go no he did the the babysitter right hulk hogan 
[01:35:30]  he did uh suburban commando and he did mr nanny i have both those movies what is mr you've never  seen mr nanny is really bad is that where he's babysitting and the kid crawls out and falls in  the pool and he has to take his big hulk arms and pull the little lad out by his  fucking cold tootsies oh look he's in a tutu yeah oh this is good yeah see he's in a tutu  he went for it he tried he never made anything good after rocky that was it yeah no he didn't 
[01:36:00]  what would be the circumstance where hulk hogan has to wear a tutu  uh oh there's there there's shiploads of money that they're giving him that have to then go to his  wife yeah it's like i wore a tutu for what for nothing he did make no holes barred no holes barred  with uh what's his name tiny zeus lister right the cross-eyed president from um yeah yeah fifth element  so that was that was a big box of a success it was the only film that was also a main event at summer 
[01:36:30]  slam that was a main event well they had when the movie came out they thought it would be a good  idea to promote the movie by making zeus the character from the movie come to the wwf to take  on the real hulk hogan how did it how did it go i mean it didn't probably didn't pan out like they  wanted the way they saw it it ended up in tag team match because all right tiny zeus lister didn't  have the proper training to be a full-time pro wrestler he's an actor why don't we talk about 
[01:37:00]  uh the big apple comic-con so you you met the ice man who was covered in blue paint yeah and he was  there with his x-men friends yeah fake x-men fans oh yeah and they were most of the costumes were  horrendous costumes that's right costumes that's correct all right we're here at big apple comic-con  with us some guy dressed in ice man ice man ice man of the x-men bobby drake i'm here with my x-men  friends of the x-gym so these are your friends indeed they are yeah my best friends uh ice man

[01:39:30]  duct tape yes hey here's a guy dave in houston how to do this at uh these events dave hey guys  how's it going hey dave throwing myself under the bus here but yes i do travel around the country  going to different shows like this um i address this conan the barbarian  why why sir why it's actually a lot of fun for who what's fun about it 
[01:40:00]  you know if you don't do it i can't explain it it's just yes you can we both we have the common  bond of language i don't understand what would be fun about getting a tranny either  uh he got you there those are fighting words it's it's it's it's receiving the blowjob probably  well you know if i if i were a single man i could probably do the same just as tony and the barbarian  so it is a lot of fun i've actually been in your studios when i was up there for new york comic con 
[01:40:30]  a couple years ago sounds like a threat and  no really end like anything you were in our studios did you do anything  uh no you talked to me a bit uh i was uh yeah you won't remember but i made a comment about looking  for shane's in a pickup truck and i got a nice phone with jimmy and i'm getting the silence  ringing all right no 
[01:41:00]  i could uh i could i could use that call on my threat assessments yeah that i yeah that guy seemed  unstable what do you sam meets david bowie from labyrinth and talks about his bulge wow  david bowie was there that's um how did i miss david bowie he was i think you asked him about the  prestige no no david bowie from labyrinth i would yeah yeah well that's what i mean it's like  you'd think there'd be a giant crowd around david bowie wow david bowie's career has dropped down 
[01:41:30]  a bit that he's hanging out at his comic cons what what happened the goblin king  was it actually david bowie no it was the goblin king oh oh so it was a guy another geeky  douchebag dressed up as the character that uh david bowie was paid very well to play that's  correct nancy this guy's getting seven dollars an hour no you guys are actually acted with uh  jennifer uh connelly when she was real hot that is correct these guys are not paid to dress up as 
[01:42:00]  superheroes and walk around these are people who pay admission dress up as a superhero  and walk around oh they're not hired by the convention no so they're just doing this for  free for fun they think this is i mean for fun excuse me they're they're not doing it for free  they're paying to get in and he's finding some real finding some really bad labyrinth oh god damn  look at that nice head that wasn't him he did a better job with the makeup all right well let's uh 
[01:42:30]  see what you got out of this guy this is zero all right we're here with david bowie from labyrinth  david bowie what's the haps oh this is uh quite some time here now uh he's doing the voice is he  trying to do the accent yeah oh my yes god he didn't have a crystal he should have had a crystal  he's quite some time here now uh what what do you hope to accomplish here at comic con or big apple con  well right now i'm just out getting as many pictures as i can i'm with my friends they're 
[01:43:00]  buying a mass load of comic books so do i see the bulge here did you work on this specifically  because of david's bulge in the film of course see actually in my costume paper they said no any  specifics and i put down the bulge what costume paper the uh there's a big costume contest going  on that wizards throwing i guess so so do you think when you look back at some of your celebrity  pictures and realize you're dressed as david bowie from labyrinth you'll feel a fool no i'll feel all  that much no i think that's true now what did you accomplish to pull off this bulge really i just 
[01:43:30]  wrapped a sock around it yeah yeah are you worried about any uh uh uh excitement down there or uh like  a semi-erection becoming making it so that your costume is not as accurate well semi-erection that  would be a problem but i'm trying to keep myself keep myself calm today you know well with all the  comic books here i would assume that you've already achieved the erection possibly no no not quite 
[01:44:00]  i've been staying away from that area good for you smart thinking yeah he is a waste of  fucking life you don't like any of these guys that was an exhausting minute and 18 seconds that's all it  was yeah and shit i was ready to grab the my bag and leave and what gives nerds erections comic  books having comic books wrapped around their dicks too i'm sure he loved that yeah toys eroc got a big  boner from that transformer toy you sure did can't wait for his girl to leave him it's gonna be a fun 
[01:44:30]  day for all of us he didn't have enough pocket money for the good toy i hope he's saving his pocket  money for that day when she goes so long he spent his last bit of pocket money on moss man and  couldn't afford his transformer toy that's moss man is that real moss like i don't think so why don't  we continue sam meets uh the joker this should be good yes the joker you know jack nicholson was there  no no no no no from uh ledger's dead so i would assume they would go right to jack nicholson so that's 
[01:45:00]  pretty cool now the joker not oh you're you're naming actors i meant the joker the joker from the  dark knight who causes problems for batman he was there he was there the joker all right how many more  of these do we have i can't even take this today we're at the big apple con with the joker the joker  what's the haps well i met adam west and batman over there is looking quite retro i can't listen 
[01:45:30]  to this why i met adam west over there looking quite retro you can tell it's the real joker by  the way his voice is oh yeah which joker is he doing from the dark knight the joker he's doing  heath ledger's version ledger joker heath ledger was probably playing him as this is there are a lot  of the jokers walking around i know there were some riddlers a lot of riddlers walking around  oh jesus that looks great what that guy he just didn't even try i love the guy stop it no that wasn't 
[01:46:00]  that that looks like a fake joker to me i spoke to a man who introduced himself as the joker  quite retro and and i had a run-in with gordon with gordon yeah commissioner gordon  yeah and what happened did he arrest you oh no and you're the joker he held me at gunpoint but  well let's just say he he's on the ground he died happy oh did you kill him 
[01:46:30]  what you're the what a fucking this this guy is giving me such douche chills what a  fucking zilch oh jimmy you don't like his improv it's fucking i kind of like horrendous  why didn't he have been found in a hotel room dead he makes bobo look like jonathan winters  what a fool this guy is look at this guy looks like screech dressed up as the joker  no he's fucking bruno from the original fame 
[01:47:00]  the caption says seth rogan joker oh yeah that's that's that's a good uh anyone with curly hair that  guy was fucking terrible with his improv awful did a few peas on the group he died happy yes  he had a gun commissioner gordon stumbling over himself few people say in the ice man that sam  interviewed uh there's a big youtube video where he's rapping at comic-con no wow so you might have  been talking to a no no no oh did you kill him since you're the joker yeah of course did you meet 
[01:47:30]  catwoman yeah of course what are you an idiot yes he has nothing yeah i gotta hear that again oh  is this a pretty easy question did you kill him and he goes yeah of course of course and just runs out  of air oh did you kill him since you're the joker yeah of course that's a of course 
[01:48:00]  hi uh this guy is oh shit i didn't think i was gonna ask that question yeah basic  fucking joker questions he can't answer did you kill commissioner right that would be  something you should figure out in your head because you might be asked that if you're walking  around as the joker did you kill him since you're the joker yeah of course did you meet catwoman  not yet is she here well the actress who plays was over there not the real catwoman 
[01:48:30]  i saw batgirl over there uh earlier today yeah you have a grudge with her too  anyone associated with batman is at fault oh i see now joker i am surprised to see you here because  i thought uh you died of an overdose of pain pills and alcohol no that was he fledger that wasn't the  joker no but i am paying tribute to he's ledger oh okay like in in all seriousness he was a great  actor and i would have loved to have met him maybe at a convention just like this yeah thanks a lot joker 
[01:49:00]  uh that's a lot joker he draws character because he was very offended i brought up really heath ledger  he would have loved to meet heath ledger guess what it's not the same hopefully he will soon  of course i killed this hey that's him nothing that's the ice man what you found the youtube rap  video this isn't the one of him rapping i think i have that though he's well built he is he's been 
[01:49:30]  very good shape oh good for him also a boob oh joker sounds like napoleon dynamite very good ronnie god  oh i interviewed that guy too i'm the joker listen on the stage the drummer like a rage i am the man and 
[01:50:00]  i'm gonna entertain okay i'm the fan of the sound of the phone turn off i'm sick but i can go all night  okay let's see can we do it right give me a topic and slate hell to make you drop it what is it anything  say something improv okay listen listen okay giraffe it's just like a plant a long neck please let me  correct you could see giraffe up eaten in the trees and a freestyle about them so easily

[01:52:30]  they all just sound like him well i'm superman he had a ghostbuster outfit  he had a ghostbuster backpack and a ghostbuster zapper you know i've never seen him in any films so  i would say he's a ghostbuster an actual ghostbuster hey before we get there we got one more on the joker  i think tim in south carolina tim the way that joker answers follow-up questions you'd think it's bob kelly 
[01:53:00]  yeah bob kelly's the joker would be pretty funny you know what dude i got these scars boom  where's the batman hey joker did he kill commissioner gordon  what's who you asking  jerry doesn't know who he is  did he ask you bob or ted the joker i didn't kill commissioner gordon he slipped on a banana peel 
[01:53:30]  his teeth left that banana peel though  see i was i was in the imaginary world bob kelly has the jokers i was asking the joker i wasn't  acknowledging that it was bob kelly per se oh okay yeah so then i said joker or did you kill uh  commissioner gordon you know what uh commissioner gordon had a lump on his prostate  dad you know what boom you got your face  let's meet a ghostbuster send an actual ghostbuster yes all right we're at the big apple comic-con with 
[01:54:00]  a ghostbuster what's the haps uh huge anniversary ghostbusters 2 celebrating its 20th anniversary  uh we heard ernie hudson was going to be here so i put on my stuff and we met him and everything i  got our picture with him wearing my gear it's very awesome very nice uh we met a couple of other  ghostbuster fans and uh people uh from long island queens around town here is that the first time  you've ever worn a ghostbusters outfit no i've been doing this since 99 2000 where do you wear it 
[01:54:30]  huh i'm around town i usually uh after work i go out around time square and uh do this people take  pictures and whatnot you charge them no it's it's it's such a great thing people love it brings joy to  kids and families so that you see the back there okay oh wow huh this is a new piece of equipment  called the ionization converter what does that do well if you remember from the first movie after they  caught slimer uh ray was talking if all if the ionization rate was constant for all ectoplasmic 
[01:55:00]  entities we find out that that's not true unfortunately i do not remember that well if you watch the movie uh  when they get back to the university of course we're talking outside the university uh outside  the university uh he has a lot of helpful information uh we're talking outside the university  chris russo sometimes i'm a ghostbuster mad dog as a ghostbuster  well you can't cross the stream this is gonna be a problem keep your mind clear don't think about  anything uh something's gonna be made oh no we gotta step up marshmallow man coming up the street 
[01:55:30]  gonna be big problems there i don't know how they're gonna handle it how do you take on the  marshmallow man as he's coming up the street there well yeah dog unfortunately i believe we're gonna  have to cross the streets just to make enough energy to fucking they take one minute detail from the  movie and blow it out of proportion and point no one gives a shit except for maybe two more  human beings on this planet you don't think that guy was interesting oh what a dork do you think 
[01:56:00]  ernie hudson is like happy when people come up like that come up to him and ask him questions  about what's he happier if michael richard just yelled his act at him why don't you talk to ernie  hudson himself he'd turn me down tell him what the fuck who are you to turn me down he thinks who  the fuck he is yeah you should just force yourself on him who gives a shit if he got thrown out of the  joint well then i wouldn't have gotten to interview a ghostbuster yeah you didn't what you interviewed an 
[01:56:30]  asshole with a fucking poster on his back stop it well sam got the next best thing instead of  talking ernie hudson he talks to this fake ghostbuster about ernie hudson yes oh so who's your favorite  ghostbuster my favorite ghostbuster is dr race dance why is that he's the heart of the ghostbusters he's  just uh uh uh thesaurus of knowledge of paranormal activity and he's a true believer of the paranormal 
[01:57:00]  just like i am you are what so you believe in the paranormal and ghosts and things but you want  to hunt them down well not all ghosts are good there are such things as help help uh help spirits  and werewolves exactly what's we're working on this to see if it will work on other supernatural  beings do you think that you could make a proton pack that will zap werewolves vampires and ghosts  we're working on it that should be the 2010 model who's working on it the guys oh boy i love how sam 
[01:57:30]  trips them up i love it too their fucking improv skills are so bad that sam throws in these soft  balls and they just can't hit them that's a great question who's working uh the guys guys they'll see  it was just a movie no one's working on this yeah why would they there's no there's really it's no reason  work passed by the firehouse that's supposed to be their headquarters you know what there's no  ghostbusters logo on top of it no what no just fire trucks that's it where is it we're working  on it that should be the 2010 model who's working on it the guys peter venkman venkman uh and ernie 
[01:58:00]  well ernie's here if you have you seen him were you disappointed that ernie hudson wasn't wearing  his uh ghostbuster outfit he's wearing it now he is he's wearing his gb2 suit the dark gray one yeah  yeah i got a picture of him like that with my gear do you think it's a little sad that ernie  hudson hasn't moved on from the silly ghostbusters he's done he's done other things he's done a  secret life of american teenager but he's still wearing that dumb suit i mean ghostbusters is  iconic yeah okay cool well it's uh it's been a pleasure talking to you and i hope you continue 
[01:58:30]  to bust the ghosts we are we're ready to believe you i don't know what that means  i don't know what that means line for the movie oh good for you god how about you do a line for  the movie we all know yes sam is just terrible i don't know any lines from ghostbusters except zap  i don't know what you mean i don't know what that means ghostbusters was a lousy movie 
[01:59:00]  i watched it recently i watched it recently i didn't like it that young man told me dated  now or something i don't know what it was but in his opinion the film ghostbusters is better than  the film goodfellas do you have a picture of this guy there's an idiot uh no did you slap him for  that long i didn't uh sam meets a guy playing with a lightsaber yeah he had his own booth there were a  lot of lightsabers there it looked almost but he he was in his own booth which you have to pay for 
[01:59:30]  and he looked almost like star wars kid just swinging his lightsaber around so i wanted to  get to the bottom of that yeah how much do you pay for a booth a lot so it's just some rich kid  well as it turns out from his dad i mean i don't want to do any spoilers but he's got a club that  he's trying to get some members let's go to this start with north american man boy  all right we're at the big apple con with one of the sword fighters what's the hats um i'm part of

[02:01:00]  that's awesome because you just know god bless the guy doesn't want to call the plastic sword  really he wants you to call it a lightsaber oh calling it a plastic sword makes it seem silly  what see this is the coolest thing in the world look oh my god they're doing uh lightsaber fights  out in the street because i was looking at him with these very interested eyes so he had to know i meant 
[02:01:30]  no harm when i said plastic sword fight wow these guys are good mr poe should do this  ha  to win in a plastic sword fight a martial artist or a dancer  so you think that's i know it's a tough one i i honestly can't say it it would depend it really 
[02:02:00]  would depend are you pissed off about all the heat that the star wars kid took on youtube  yeah look um look i mean just because we're a you know a group that runs around with giant glow  sticks we do get some some graft but nobody gets the joke better than we do i mean we we tell that you  know we insult ourselves better than we you know anyone else can't make fun of yourselves they  insult themselves better than anyone else can i doubt that's true they are so serious oh wait

[02:03:30]  star wars you're holding you know you're holding a sword of pure energy well it's a toy with a light  ball yes it is essentially a flat flashlight it is it is i mean but just the idea that you can do  anything with well you can't cut anything i mean physically like tricks and stuff i mean you could  do fencing you could do broadsword you could do samurai swords you could do you know that you could  also technically do that with a pointer for a chalkboard yes yes you could or a pool cue yes or like a

[02:13:30]  you gotta make it wet and then talk it to us oh  get the microphone a kiss  oh they got the second best idea so far uh tim hey good morning boys hey tim  hey uh another idea that they're having up in wisconsin is playing a montage of every single  interception brett farve through while he's in green bay that was an idea that's actually pretty funny 
[02:14:00]  funny i like it all right good boys punch it out um oh man there's something i do want to get into  but what i want to defend leno a little bit against what against howard stern but then you talk about  howard and then all hell fucking breaks loose everywhere why is he best but howard's got to  be called out uh on pop eater dot com howard is ranting and raving the last few days that leno's  ripping him off oh god that was well basically no leno is uh what's the bit leno's doing can you help 
[02:14:30]  me out danny basically i think he's getting a chicken leno's getting a chicken and i think  terry bradshaw to pick football games so terry bradshaw i think this is how it goes terry bradshaw  picks some football games right and then the chicken does the same thing by doing whatever  a fucking chicken does and and picking football games okay a chicken now it's it's it's very fair  to say that howard's been doing this bit for a while okay and leno's doing a bit that's either 
[02:15:00]  exactly the same or very similar now howard's yelling and screaming and uh you know getting  people to listen about this uh this whole jay leno ripping him off thing the problem is that  howard ripped off the bit oh really it's an old old old and i mean old school morning zoo bit that  that goes back to the beginning of morning zoo radio remember that so for howard to yell and scream  that leno's ripping him off is just not fucking fair there's a million fucking radio guys that did 
[02:15:30]  the bit before howard did it's one of those dumb staple bits of morning zoo radio yeah and if maybe the  boys down the hall could do a little research you can find a million examples of shows doing it  before howard but for some reason howard comes up with you know someone else's bit and then all  of a sudden it becomes his it's just not fair for the guys that did it before him well it's the  it's the whole act you think it's everything that's yeah but he says for the past how many  fucking he fucking hates leno so he's going after him hard and this is the latest thing he's doing and 
[02:16:00]  it's like okay howard but why don't you acknowledge that you got the bit from other morning shows  because that's what happened you didn't do that bit first so many years you didn't do that bit first  there's a million versions of him where you you walk a cow around and the cow fucking shits because  it shits every fucking 30 seconds and whatever team is shit on you pick that team right you know  for the week there's a million versions of that bit yeah you get the monkey doing it all sorts of  shit oh well but a lot of people are fucking on the instant feedback with that today so i just 
[02:16:30]  want to that's my two cents on the whole thing that's my two cents i mean if leno's doing it the  exact same way as howard i you know i don't know but i do know that howard didn't come up with that  bit that's a that's an old school fucking radio bit that's been around for a long fucking time  uh rob in australia thank you for calling out stirring this guy constantly trashes leno's show  yeah he's obsessed with uh you know killing leno so i don't know what that's about i'm very happy 
[02:17:00]  with so silly i think it has something to do with our you know what leno said about us instead of  like radio it could be it goes back also to stuttering john and they had some weird thing  yeah that was big when uh when he went over there but god forbid stuttering john moves on for a really  good gig i mean what do you what you wanted him to do all right here we go a little kid asked obama  why everyone hates him that we don't have to get why everyone hates wait the kid or why everyone 
[02:17:30]  hates obama obama oh so he's wondering why everyone hates obama okay here we go uh priscilla in  freeport priscilla yeah hi hey uh i was talking i was thinking about uh back in the day i miss used to  do a thing with calvin trillin the author all the time about the uh chicken playing tic-tac-toe in  chinatown the chicken is still in chinatown this chicken's locked in a cage and you can play  tic-tac-toe with it that's exactly what i uh what stern is talking about i missed this probably 25 
[02:18:00]  years ago well this is yeah there you go so it's not original there's one example the first phone  call that came in i i i guarantee there's a million others that will come in in the next half hour so  howard's gotta if he wants to say that that's fine but why don't you tell the people where you got the  bit from you didn't come up with that he didn't come up with it the chicken's still there all right  thank you you're welcome there relax she's obsessed with the fact that the chicken is still  there yeah you're really having a panic attack over there i'm sure it's a different chicken just  simmer down lady the chickens live for what a month yeah it's not the same chicken and i gotta answer 
[02:18:30]  i gotta answer reading it's it's one of the bits so just bear with me yes reading wherever i went  people were asking me about the whole stern leno thing wherever i went i couldn't get anything done  yesterday because that's all they wanted to know of course they couldn't wait for my opinion on the  whole thing so there you go i finally gave it so now the people in the street could stop asking me  what do you think of that was happening all the time man wherever i go but hey this this young man 
[02:19:00]  right here right here i'm gonna let him use my special mic hey there's a big guy don't go oh come on man  i mean this is uh all right what's your name terence scott uh terence scott what do you have to say  i have to say why people hate you and and why you they're supposed to love you and god is loving  that's what i'm talking about come on hey that's what i'm talking about terence i appreciate that what 
[02:19:30]  what what grade are you in fourth you're in fourth grade well now first of all uh i did get elected  president so 15 not everybody hates me now i don't want you to oh i got a whole lot of votes i want to  make sure everybody understand but you know what is true is if you if you're watching tv lately it seems  like everybody's just getting mad all the time um and i you know i think that you've got to take it with 
[02:20:00]  a grain of salt some of it is just what's called politics where you know once uh one party wins then  the other party kind of gets it feels like it it needs to poke you a little bit a little bit um to  keep you on your toes but if it's all party and so you shouldn't take it too seriously well you should  jesus getting massacred people i'm not very happy with you  the one observation i have about obama yeah i got one too i know you oh shit sorry we all we 
[02:20:30]  know all your observations all right that's why it's a surprise where i have a little one  he seems to be talking quote blacker yeah yeah like he has kind of uh like a like a like a like a  like a cadence to him now that he didn't have when he was running for president he's always had that a  little bit but depending on where he is and who he's around he can sound uh a little more hip uh 
[02:21:00]  you know a little more i'm from the street right then uh he does when he's in front of you know  congress and whatnot right uh so when he's in front of this kid he's like yeah let me tell you like  hillary clinton used to do yes do we have the hillary clinton audio of which he spoke with her black  vernacular oh was that awful oh we can find that yeah oh i'm gonna jump down turn around pick me a  bale of cotton lord of mercy yeah she was just oh she just embarrassed herself that's one of the most 
[02:21:30]  embarrassing clips i've ever heard is her speaking with her black accent her blackness her blackness  calves up in the motherfucking house sticks of butter up in this  uh anthony another uh howard thing that has to be said too because it's on the wikipedia jordan 
[02:22:00]  and scranton pa doing a little research howard thinks too that he invented the reality show  yeah but there were reality shows in like the 60s and 70s what was the famous one where they  followed the fucking family around what it was the first reality show there were a bunch of reality  shows before howard started doing quote reality shows which led to everyone else doing reality  shows my mother the car my favorite martian yes that was a reality show did you notice that the uh 
[02:22:30]  balloon boy that that fucking that fucking weather balloon looked like the my favorite martian thing  it looked like a little flying saucer little flying saucer for my favorite martian  i do say brother man when we got black gas so i guess i do the same thing as obama  yeah huh obama he's got a thing where at the end he kind of goes down a little bit  and then up and then and up and maybe down and god bless america let's change america right we got the 
[02:23:00]  hillary clip i want to hear this let's hear this awful i don't feel no way he's tired  i've come too far from where i started from nobody told me that the road would be easy  i don't believe he brought me this far to leave me  ah holy shit hold on that's got sinking you don't remember that 
[02:23:30]  fuck she is fucking was she terrible i gotta hear that one more time please was she imitating someone  what's the what's the story behind this clip because there's no way she would just do another  one of her talking like that too she was in front of a bunch of uh black people right and she i guess  was she like kind of it was a black uh you know a speech i guess or a part of a speech that somebody  had given and she kind of wanted to uh it up a little bit what does that mean i couldn't hear you

[02:25:30]  the chicken chicken in the chicken was a bust yeah you kind of failed this yeah the chicken really  let everyone down yeah yeah his opening line was funny but all right that was hey what do you got  on this nightclub thing this is a bullshit phenomenon people go there they dance  it's a nightclub thing i don't get it  what uh what i guess i guess what an author invited 175 people to a nightclub 
[02:26:00]  oh the black woman yeah says the club only let white people in oh  and then but they get whatever let's go to the news story and then we can comment what's the name  of the place  i was going to say it  diva vanessa williams this youtube clip says it shows the singer on stage at trendy manhattan  nightclub greenhouse down on barrack street  but tonight another high-profile greenhouse guest is singing the blues accusing the hip soho 
[02:26:30]  club of racism best-selling author terry woods launching a bombshell billion dollar bias lawsuit  claiming the message she got from greenhouse is blacks are not welcome wood says she invited 175  guests to a signing for her new book alibi at greenhouse in manhattan in august the shocked  author says the majority of her black guests were barred from entering the club while a handful of her  white guests they got in no problem why did she throw that stupid fucking trendy club like i i don't 
[02:27:00]  know who to believe in this one because i hate those clubs and i i hate the fucking doorman because  they really do let in beautiful people everyone knows that scumbags they're going for a look for  their club so they picked those people out of the line were there black people in this club i don't  know but why she had like like it was a book event and it's like and then she said the owner tweet  like texted her saying look i told you it's dorm up to doorman discretion like the owner seems like  oh is that one of those like studio 54 kind of entrances where they decide who gets in who doesn't 
[02:27:30]  what kind of low self-esteem  asshole are you on that line to stand there i hope that you're picked by some  fucking immigrant what's wrong with you people good about getting in though me too i want to go  i would be accepted and you would actually you wouldn't say i would be so accepted hell never  and fucking dummies that go to these clubs are dummies you deserve it why would you ever go to a  place where you can't just get like you're gonna stand online shivering hoping some scumbag validates 
[02:28:00]  you they could have been turned down at my bar no they couldn't have been not if they have a  not if they have a pussy in less than 18 years on  uh pete in connecticut's got info on a clip there's got to be more of that clip i'm telling you  well i'm not a big fan of hillary but that's much more to that clip but she was actually quoting uh  uh a um a gospel song called uh i don't feel no ways tired yeah i don't feel no ways tired why 
[02:28:30]  was she saying it like that well i mean well let's hear the original song it's i mean it would be kind  of like if you're reading if you're reading uncle remus it's spelled out in a certain way uncle remus  i don't feel no way's tired let's hear james cleveland did the song originally that's how  he said i'm sure we have it because we have a gospel station on serious x am right 
[02:29:00]  if uh if travis has that oh god steve from  what did the race i can't i can't say it but i just want to acknowledge that steve is a genius  is that something to do with work it's terrible  no not at all he's had uncle remus but he said something else  oh sounds like it sounds like a peanut butter 
[02:29:30]  that fucking ain't all right we got that song here's the gospel song that pete's talking about  nasty  and she said all i want to tell y'all tonight he lifts keep it quiet in the back 
[02:30:00]  that i've been running for jesus over 50 some odd years  there's no way hillary knew this song on her own  someone had to tell her about this song  i don't feel no way tired  how does this tie into hillary's shitty campaign  why would you be tired you weren't fucking your husband was doing that with someone else  i don't feel no way tired 
[02:30:30]  i don't feel no way tired  i don't feel no way i'll kill the rabbit and make it look like an accident  this lisping  ass who is this here's the point 
[02:31:00]  shined up it could bring a couple of bits on the open market  this song yeah enough with this song awful song  we get the point oh we don't feel no way tired you're warm  i don't feel no way tired oh what a big-tongued ass he was  why would you add more words if you can't talk with those say i don't feel tired exactly i don't 
[02:31:30]  feel no way tired no way time or no way i feel tired yeah i don't feel tired no way that's work  fucking that up yeah jesus let's get to part two of the big lawsuit the discrimination lawsuit  she's suing for a billion dollars by the way it's a lot of money a billion that's a lot of food and  beverage they plan on a lawyer describes one incident they went to the door and all three of  them were on terry's guest list the hispanic white-looking female was allowed into the club  and the two black women were turned away the club's owner didn't come on camera tonight but 
[02:32:00]  called the claims of racism bogus and this self-described frequent greenhouse club goer  who was not there the night in question says at any club the velvet ropes are rough but a greenhouse  you get in based on looks not skin tone i don't think it's based on race i mean it's just  as as sad as it is in this world dna's like clubs are just they just choose the better looking  a spokesperson for greenhouse told pix news the allegations of racism were grossly false  however we will not litigate this matter through the media as miss woods has now let me tell you 
[02:32:30]  something i gotta be honest with you i can't stand the idea of those clubs either where it's like  the beautiful people get in stuff but i guess it's their prerogative so if if women walk up and they  look like you know if fucking uh a woman that looked like beyonce came wheeling up there they're  letting her in if some big fat ass motherfucker comes up to there they're not letting her in white  or black the fact that it's a bad decision by the author to hold it at one like like the greenhouse to 
[02:33:00]  me she was just asking for trouble going there they sound like a bunch of fucking dopey scumbags if you  go to that club you're an asshole there you go why would you stand in line to be fucking picked by  some cunty doorman so i would never do that to get picked but i would never subject myself to that  you're jimmy norton though you would oh it's fucking awful you know what you don't get you  don't you you don't like the place you were turned away then you don't go there again you tell people  that the place sucked and you don't go there the the idea though that everything's got a 
[02:33:30]  fucking just that racism word has to come out for everything now if say if a black person does  something and is denied anything criticized about anything it automatically is racism right off the  fucking bat enough already sometimes it's just the person's an asshole not a racist that's what  happens sometimes you're an asshole and it has nothing to do with racism like reverend al and 
[02:34:00]  rush limbaugh fuck reverend al is he getting an asshole where we at with that rush giving the  apology i hope not but i don't i really don't think he's gonna apologize rush limbaugh will never  apologize what's what's what's reverend al trying to do to rush first of all he's never getting that  motherfucker thrown off the air tell you that much no the fucking guy makes rush and he's got  powerful people behind it it's pure politics so it really would look like they are trying to 
[02:34:30]  you know squash a political voice and somebody else would hire him do you think if he got fired  he get hired the next day somewhere else oh my god he's got thousands of fucking affiliates it's  huge and what is reverend al so mad at that he tried to fucking some kind of slander right yeah yeah  what did rush limbaugh actually say libel what did he say i believe that rush was commenting on the uh  riots back in the down heights and i think and said that um reverend al's actions and words during that 
[02:35:00]  time were uh directly um responsible for um a man being killed the man that uh what was so that would  be slim yankle rosenbaum yankle rosenbaum uh his family is offered to just defend rush anyway they  think they're the largest lawyers yeah apparently he had uh run over a child black child and the crowd  went like fucking bullshit on him and um it started riots that lasted for quite a while and reverend al was 
[02:35:30]  throwing out some um what was perceived at the time especially some inflammatory things i think he said  something about if you jews want to get it on yeah he did say a lot of inflammatory  shit if i remember correctly yeah can i he's a piece of shit i do have to stop the discussion  for one second because josh in jersey has a very good observation his his exit this is the one you  saw today okay my car's xm unit only shows 10 characters it says racist and ig no it's supposed to  say racist nightclub racist nightclub but his xm unit only has 10 characters how great is that oh 
[02:36:00]  shit i just want to acknowledge it because that's the type of thing some asshole would try to get us  in trouble yeah take a picture of it right it's not our fault that his unit only has 10 characters  oh we got to play with that 10 character thing now fuck that's funny sorry yeah but god that's funny  yeah so all right rush said that and yeah and now uh reverend al wants an apartment now wants to 
[02:36:30]  he's he's actually yeah wants an apology or else he's gonna sue uh i'd like to see that because um  you know i think rush has enough money to litigate and you get the feeling that his lawyers will probably  i bet that the station lawyers will stand behind him that'll be nice and i bet uh well no he wrote  that in an op-ed piece for the uh i think the wall street journal which i think it's  rush opinion editorial right is that what that means i'm guessing he was he was well within his 
[02:37:00]  means anyone else getting the uh impression that reverend al stock is uh dropping finally  yes he doesn't get that feeling that juice that he had before and i think a couple of  being elected has something to do with the last few of his protests they had to just kind of walk  away because the the people he was protesting against just just they stood strong and just waited it  out like whatever happened to the fucking cartoon guy nothing because they just hung in there that  was fox uh and the post yeah they just hung in there they don't abandon their people like other 
[02:37:30]  shitty companies and reverend al had to walk away i mean that went away remember how the athletes  weren't going to be talking to anybody from uh yup that paper they're talking to that paper of course  they are so nothing happened reverend al and there's been a couple others in the last uh year or  so he is uh definitely lost uh some of that juice that he's that he had yeah he's a fucking phony  i think i think um obama being elected did have a lot to do with it you think yeah kind of you know  empowered black people more they could look up to obama instead of having a you know have their um a 
[02:38:00]  self-appointed and anointed black leader uh reverend al and jesse jackson yeah those two went around like  they were you know they they pretty much self-appointed themselves leader of black  people spokesperson for black people and uh then you get obama you know he gets elected president  and uh you know that's that but here's the problem and you're absolutely correct but then the our 
[02:38:30]  black listeners will call up and go well they don't represent me oh i know yeah so it's like all  right but who's your guy that's the perception you guys gotta get together and get a real guy always  said perception more important than reality and i believe when the black listeners call and say hey  you know reverend al and uh and jesse jackson don't represent me but you know something in the news  they do in the media in the media and media portrays it like reverend al and jesse jackson's  king of the black people speaks both of them speak for most a majority of black people and that's  because reverend al gets up there and says he is up there to defend uh black people and and and and 
[02:39:00]  black people like why get the fuck out shut up uh-huh needs you let me uh go to matt in queens  hey matt how are you good how are you guys doing better now matt great hey uh i just wanted to point  out what at the very beginning of that news story he says that uh i don't remember the words exactly  but basically a majority of the black people were turned away and a handful of her white friends were 
[02:39:30]  let in i mean that sounds about even to me so i don't really know what the problem is so if only a  handful of whites were let in that means most of them weren't and a majority of the blacks were sent  away which means a few were let in so where's the problem yeah so it sounds like some black people  from her group were let it didn't get it yeah and it sounds like the some didn't get in they were  probably big fat asses that the club didn't want in there fattening up their place yeah looking all  fat that's right bumping their fat bodies everybody else's nice body who wants fatty fat fat in their 
[02:40:00]  place out on the dance floor doing the ass dance just squatting down putting their hands on their  knees and going with that big fat ass you don't want to see that certainly don't it  so basically they're trying to make a big deal out of yes they are hey uh good to know kevin from  connecticut thank you sir uh writes enter ugly homo sapiens into the pad data the 10 characters uh will  display ugly homos oh okay with the ass oh well oh yeah some of these boys doing the ass dance 
[02:40:30]  right there i'm gonna go i'll see nice that's that just isn't um nice right that looks like she's  taking a shit nice right look at him moving that ass so you got to worry about slipping out when they  do that though move that because it's moving too fast you can't recover quickly enough before you get  the dick bend you don't want the dick bend oh yeah they just got an extra fucking muscle or something 
[02:41:00]  back there i gotta do my jimmy the greek today there's a degree there's an extra muscle back there  no how the fuck does a black girl's ass move like that you can't get a white girl to move an ass like  that would you no would you no it's fat would you no jesus  frightening it scares you what is it just ass dances danny danny just bounce out with just ass 
[02:41:30]  dances yeah there's a girl here uh a little a little wide in the hips got booty on her not bad  but uh actually nipple placement doesn't look bad underneath the top but i can't really tell  what's going on there but uh no oh i thought she was looking at her top yeah i was gonna say  i hate the fake uh tease that's what's in the top oh she might be no no no that's a boring booty

[02:46:30]  fucking go away before the cement is dry on the top of the statue they're chipping away at the base  don't encourage it for this weekend i need nice people fast forward a few years and they'll pick  apart every single fucking thing you do and it's gonna be he's he used to be good he's a sellout  is he doing this i remember back when and then insert something good that you don't do now right 
[02:47:00]  god forbid you try to move on and and do other things with the radio show yeah you know as a  human being and as and as a radio show host i just remembered that this is the weekend the last time i  was here we it was way out but we mentioned this weekend this was the weekend that i said bobo could  come by and do a guest spot ah shit bobo's gonna be there no because we didn't follow through with any  of it bobo be there i would i would i would i would i would i would do five minutes if he if he comes 
[02:47:30]  i'm sure vinny wouldn't care all i ask is you videotape because when he did it for boss that  video did very well and it was it was so uncomfortable i will have you ever seen it  i saw it last time i was here because he was in okay then no worries yeah they'll find it out  though hey uh joe also brought up a nice observation he was supposed to be in at nine and we're in the  middle of doing a fucking break and it's tough to bring in a guy in the middle of the shit we're  doing so there are times these guys have to wait a little too long down the hall and what were you  saying that you had to be and yeah you had to be entertained by steve and e-rock that's gonna be 
[02:48:00]  really exciting hey uh i was sitting with steve and e-rock and i was reading the uh daily news or the  post or something and they have this sammy the bull remember that guy of course we all remember  sammy yeah he's back in the news because they're gonna bring him out to testify i guess in defense  of the of junior gaudy who's on trial in defense of junior gaudy uh i didn't understand i  just he turns on the dad yeah i just read every other word i think that's what it said but it 
[02:48:30]  was something about he turns on gaudy's father but he's gonna defend gaudy's son young god he's  trying to say he's up for murder and i think what they're saying is if sammy the bull comes out he  might be able to prove that this murder was committed by the senior gaudy and not the junior  god i don't know okay i was confused by it so you think sammy's gonna do the right thing for once  yeah that's not the right thing really it's kind of just well if you're how does he how is he still  alive like how could he come back here and be like hi everybody it well that's weird that's 
[02:49:00]  we're talking about he's still alive because it i mean the article and it said he was he was  convicted of being involved he admitted to this he was involved with 19 mob murders because he  ratted out gaudy they were like we're gonna let you off with five years in prison and witness  protection group he made it that's it like you got a free pass you killed a bunch of people  congrats you got away with it have fun in arizona and then he goes to arizona and he starts this  ecstasy ring and he doesn't even keep it quiet he gets busted for that and they said it was the 
[02:49:30]  largest ecstasy ring in the history of the country all he had to do was behave that's it i mean it's  not like he was trying to you know uh sell a little dope from his backyard if you wanted to sell ecstasy  be like the third largest in the country you can't keep that on the qt if you're the largest  in the country they're gonna come and look for you yeah that's coming from and then what i meant by do  the right thing was not be a rat all the fucking time and help out one of the mob guys and and  you know he can't really help out uh gotti senior anymore but the least he could do is help out his 
[02:50:00]  fucking the thing though is how does gotti jr look at him even if he's testifying in his defense  look at him and go there's the guy true that made that is responsible for my father  falling apart from cancer in prison true and dying a horrible death in prison he can't look at him and  go hey thanks it's a tough spot sammy but then he could be free maybe because of what he has to say  i feel bad if joe even read the goddamn article the right way you probably i did i'm not i'm not 
[02:50:30]  having a whole discussion on something that's not even true thanks joe god we're taking joe to rose's  word that this is what the story is yeah you guys have a team of guys working for you why  why is all the pressure on me to get these facts straight brought it up called uninformed didn't  you i mean come on yeah the show's called uninformed the show's called uninformed why are we listening  to you i am incredibly stupid i will fully admit it i literally all right someone's got to read the  article now because i guarantee this let's see how wrong it is blatant problems with joe's version 
[02:51:00]  for years but you read news like we do you just pick up a paragraph here a little word here and  there and then you don't even usually read the paragraph i like the text under the pictures  the text under the pictures is all i read it's like oh okay that's what he's doing yeah that's  why they took this picture for years i had bits of my act that were completely incorrect and i would  people would come up to me after shows and they would go i just do a bit about ronald mcdonald house  where i said it was i would go they're just they just keep that place open so they have so they can 
[02:51:30]  keep the retards safe so they can staff the restaurants with them but they're not for  retarded people it's for like terminal diseases people literally come up to a hundred shows and go  even around mcdonald house it's not for retarded people and i go hey don't i don't want to know  i don't want to know it's a good bit it's working i don't want to know  it's funny it's funny i'm not doing a new show wrong though i'm not doing a new show oh you know  i dropped it oh that's great joe de rosa playing the stress factory this weekend that's a show people 
[02:52:00]  should definitely go see thank you stress factory.com funny hey uh have you ever done a joctober with us  no i'm excited they were telling me yeah are you excited yeah i am seriously i wasn't sure if you  wanted to do that if we should just riff or we should do one of our bits this is called the  comedians bridge burning uh we do here which is where we take a show and after we're done  talking about it you will never appear on their program if you're playing in their city it's 
[02:52:30]  wonderful people are bringing up the fact that i do get my knowledge from placemats i just want  to acknowledge that oh that's true reading their comments did you ever hear about that one opie came  in with a story about something the horn screamer yeah yeah that  that's a fucking bird that's a happy bird that's horrible it's it's got a clogged beak  it needs a shotgun that is some steroids up its beak i think it's very allergic to something horrible 
[02:53:00]  hey hold on hold on a little i know we're off-roading we'll get back to your point though  would you rather hear this now wait  or this  that's the someone's cell phone is on  you have to choose which one i would rather hear the buzzy buzzy buzzy thing all right there you go  sorry tell joe the story yeah so it was a story about these fucking birds 
[02:53:30]  whatever it wasn't hope he kept insisting that he read this story and and um the new york times  i went for the paper it's like new york times where's the story couldn't find it and stuff and  he kept searching it we had guys searching it all over the place and then uh well he finally realized  where he did see it it was the back of a placemat at a diner you know you know those fun facts next to  where you take your crayon and go through the maze it's like wow either the new york times 
[02:54:00]  or a placemat and boy what a surprise listeners haven't let me uh you get away with that one  since it's a big they remind me at every moment jesus christ do you remember where you were reading  the placement what restaurant oh somewhere in the woods of connecticut or something  danny can you hear yet over there you can when are they getting that done for you  this week did they say that though yeah okay if they don't then uh well all right whatever all 
[02:54:30]  right that's really funny man just that the arguments i've had with burr in my living room  where halfway through it he just goes i go where did you what are you i don't know if i can  listen to me what the fuck do you want from me he taps out on his own argument  i don't care i don't care how much knowledge you think you know there's always someone that  could ask just one question too many that will make you completely fall apart yeah on your knowledge 
[02:55:00]  totally you gotta hang in there as best you can but you keep asking questions everyone falls apart  i don't know i don't know yeah yeah all right what are you asking me for see my big thing when we  were off the air for two years i started reading political books and if anyone knows anything about  this radio show i suck at politics but for a time i didn't really ever bring it to radio but in my just  regular life i was like quoting what i read in these books like it was my shit and that i was really 
[02:55:30]  on the up and up as far as democrats and republicans and this and that just because i read a few of  those dumb books that are that come out like once a week that's the point that's the alternative comic  approach they read something in a book and then they go on stage and act like everybody else is stupid  because they don't know it yeah i understand when they themselves read it somewhere and then all you  have to do is like take a piece of it and uh throw the other side at it like a republican angle and 
[02:56:00]  someone read a book about you know the democratic angle on something you throw the republican angle  at it and the person just goes what now yeah that does make sense kind of hmm yeah i didn't read that  part i gotta know it kind of works both ways though no i'll definitely i was just using that as an  example because you know i love what mike slant yeah i love when people too will just go they'll just go  no i don't think that that's true like i got into an argument about michael moore last night with a  friend of mine he is fat yeah he is he's really fat and uh i was saying i was like yeah watch this 
[02:56:30]  documentary called michael moore hates america was a really interesting documentary they really  exposed a lot about the guy and how much he fucks with his viewers like he skews all this  shit yeah and she's like well i think he makes good and i go and she goes i think that's an  inflammatory name michael moore hates america and i go but he says that himself and she's like no i don't  think he does and i'm like they have footage of him in the movie going don't ever be like america 
[02:57:00]  it's the worst thing you do is ever be that's the exact quote don't ever be like america she goes  they probably took that out of context you just can't what other context could it be  unless there's a guy named america who's a scumbag sitting next to him don't ever be like america  this guy's a piece of was he saying it through a bullhorn though that's at a building i think he was  saying he loves yelling at buildings through bullhorns he was saying it through a cheeseburger  his mouth was lodged with cheeseburger the last i looked at michael moore buildings don't have ears 
[02:57:30]  god uh sambo  here he comes sam is our uh liaison uh to the radio shows out there that are featured during jocktober  that's right which is the month that uh we uh pay tribute to uh shows that you have them in your  towns and everything there they're usually the guy and then the girl you don't know are they married 
[02:58:00]  you know you can't tell sometimes i was actually it is a theme uh this year oh yeah i was doing  radio i was listening to a show today that won't be featured because i didn't like the vibe of it  but it was a very corny show and they said they had done rocktober to death so this month since  it was halloween it was spooktober  can we do spooktober the rest of the month no i don't think i don't think we could do that  see they probably would do scary they would probably do scary things with that right i'm 
[02:58:30]  talking like halloween witches goblins things yeah yeah that would be a little different  why i don't understand we would be doing scary as well it'd just be a little yeah we would do  scary too i understand scary um but um i understand yeah hey let's make this official before we get  to jocktober happy jocktober everybody from your friends at the op and anthony show  it's a celebration of hacky pukey radio shows and dj's from across this great nation of ours 
[02:59:00]  oh it's just the worst that sound is actually coming out from between her legs rather than  her mouth i think yeah right of the crapola it's jocktober there's a person stranded there's a show  there's a show it's stranded that's funny good stuff hey now there you go there's a little there's  a little improv stand-up for you what the hell was that happy jocktober everybody from your friends 
[02:59:30]  at the op and anthony show let's all do it there was no joy attached to them now none oh my god  there you go all right jocktober we feature uh who today who is this well everybody said oh he won't  come on to the west coast oh he knows better than that but guess what west coast oh october is  coming your way because today we're going to san jose san jose california that's right and uh what uh 
[03:00:00]  what show are we looking bill and maria on mix 106.5 that's weird there's not many uh radio stations  called mix do they play a mix of all the hits all the music that yeah it's like i feel like some  people were saying you know i like the top 40 station but i just i can't relate to it it's too  young and they were like and the adult contemporary it's okay but it's so slow right thank god for mix 
[03:00:30]  106.5 i'm thrilled to say i don't play san jose so let's start trashing this  you'll never be on a mix station never if you're on a mix station then you really got to think about  what you're doing for a career there's plenty of radio shows out there that would be good for you  all right stay away from the mix but here's the thing that make bill and maria a little different  than most shows yeah what's that sam it's a guy and a girl together yeah and you think the way they 
[03:01:00]  go back and forth that they were married no but they're not but they're not no but they have that  little banter back and forth like oh and and does the girl try to keep him in check a little bit oh  god because the guys will just get you know if a girl wasn't there they get a little too crazy  he gets a little boisterous you got to see their pictures i think i'm living groundhog day  i know yeah rocktober is groundhog day i'm very confused let's get a picture of them all right 
[03:01:30]  right oh what's the what's the problem i think what i saw as a lowercase i is an l because we're  doing bill and marla oh it's not maria oh it's bill and marla well that's completely different right  see the thing about bill and marla is they're not married but you'd think they were okay  maria doesn't come into the picture at all right exactly how appropriate is it that on the website  uh the mix logo is in clit pink they all look like that those mix logos 
[03:02:00]  hey jrs if you're making fun of married couples this shocktober or joctober oh how could you  possibly leave out scott and todd all right listen what's what's today's date you know okay you know  it has to end with scott the worst radio show it is ending with the worst popular radio show in  in the history of radio it's ending with opie and anthony all right this guy looks like a fat brian

[03:03:30]  tied up in the microphone cord and he's wearing a leopard print um i don't know what that is she's  supposed to be like a laser she's a cougar i mean she's she's a married woman so you know she's not  going to be out there with the but you know she's still got her wits about it she's still got a little  edge to her she likes to let me tell you something when she goes out she likes to know that they're  still looking they're still looking if push comes to shove she's got options yep yep

[03:17:30]  show first their first topic was pets dressed up in halloween costumes yeah and their second topic  was this is very original it's never been done in radio what's your favorite  scary movie  you want you want to know what cunt wrecker is writing today what  cunt wrecker yeah he writes dirt of the day is when marla  i don't know scrapes out her dirty pussy and shows everybody  oh  jesus is that necessary oh my god dirt of the day 
[03:18:00]  get it get it yeah i get it that's great all right well marla tells a story about renting a  scary movie it wouldn't be interesting on a one-on-one basis let alone being broadcast  this piece of sam sam doing a little op-ed piece there i i just  sometimes i get carried away over the weekend i was very disappointed because i finally said all  right this is it i'm getting my rent neither the living dead the classic  sure you know the  george romero's night  this guy cannot just talk like a human everything has to be 
[03:18:30]  george romero  a juicy story about george romero i think he was just doing jiminy glick  a juicy how about you just carry on a  fucking conversation like a human yeah that's all we ask from our radio show hosts out there  bill is just very excitable jesus that's all it is 
[03:19:00]  you know i don't i don't blame him because he's probably just sitting there going do you have  any idea what a living hell it is to be the real me i'm just gonna pretend them all these other  people and voices you know you you really can't blame him he's saddled with that next to him  just picking it is every word he's got that big come catching mustache across that top lip  george romero oh my god fantastic over the weekend i was very disappointed because i finally 
[03:19:30]  said all right this is it i'm getting my rent night of the living dead the classic you know  the classic zombie movie right i get up to the front i'm all excited i'm really into it the girl  goes i'm sorry you can't rent this i go why some malarkey about it's on the shelf but it was a  customer's what it was reserved for somebody is that what's losing something like one of the  customers i didn't make it made no sense to me it's like really can i just borrow it for the night 
[03:20:00]  i'll bring it back i'll bring it right back trust me no we can't give it to you i go well then get  it off the shelf i mean don't let it sit there teasing you on a second oh is that it yeah what the  fuck year is she living in she's renting tapes she's renting like tapes we don't even have  blockbuster stores in manhattan anymore and it didn't even sound like a blockbuster it sounded  like a mom and pop video store that's holding a tape for somebody yeah and you know in in manhattan  it's a small little town called manhattan yeah yeah you know i wouldn't even know where to rent 
[03:20:30]  a movie at this point they closed down all the blockbusters in in my area yes i would i wouldn't  know you would have to go and buy that film now yeah like best buy or something for 6.99 you can't  rent movies it's literally like dvds are like 6.99 now best buy because everybody's got blu-ray go and  buy it off of your six figures a year radio salary that you're making the highway robbery that you're  committing by doing a half hour radio every day and then running off with six figures in your 
[03:21:00]  fucking bank you fucking jizz as you let the music you were talking for most of the morning  uh don't forget there's a lot of music more music i don't i don't get it it's 2009 it's a disgrace  that i can't go to a west coast video yeah put in my top-loading vcr  you also noticed that bill was repeating the end of every sentence oh was he that marla did  oh can we hear that again yeah i gotta hear that we're running out of clips there are some days when 
[03:21:30]  we do jocktober it's like yeah whatever that's it for today but then there are days like today i want i  want a million bill and marla cornucopia oh yeah this over the weekend i was very disappointed  because i finally said all right this is it i'm getting i'm gonna rent night of the living dead  the classic sure you know the classic zombie movie right i get up to the front i'm all excited i'm  really into it the girl goes i'm sorry you can't rent this i go why some malarkey about it's on the  shelf but it was a customer's what it was reserved for somebody something something like one of the 
[03:22:00]  customers i didn't make it made no sense to me it's like really can i just borrow it for the night  i'll bring it back i'll bring it right back trust me no we can't give it to you i go well then get  it off the shelf i mean don't let it sit there teasing you you'll bring it right back get it off the  shelf get off the shelf apparently they do this thing in video stores where uh the box doesn't  mean it's there you have to be dvds behind the box oh yeah i forgot about that it's always so 
[03:22:30]  disappointing well you know big uh stars like this don't get out with the common folk often they  don't know what our you know how things work in our world it's very disappointing when you'd go and uh  pick up the box and be like oh cool they got the movie there's no tapes behind it  very disappointing uh of course you can go to netflix and instant it is on instant instant which means you  click it and you're playing danny is literally putting the movie on right now and and here it 
[03:23:00]  is yeah we're officially watching the movie right now so that was really hard stupid marla no but  netflix said uh someone else is watching it right now because it only gets pumped out to one person  at a time at a time yeah at a time yeah yeah jesus christ there it is it's on yeah it's on i hope her  life i hope her life ends like the dog's life ended dog's life  jesus christ christ me and marley joke nothing we are actually watching it's now on let's try a 
[03:23:30]  little humor i didn't just try a little humor there yeah there it is okay hey uh take their  special last call what's the special last call well they do a bit it's like imagine how exciting it  would be to be the last caller of a radio show every day what kind of reward would you we're done  with their show already well we got two more they don't do a lot of talking this is and this is the  talking they've got done yes these are the highlights direct let me put it this way the 
[03:24:00]  clue that every day we probably have 20 to 30 minutes of average whatever run-of-the-mill type radio  can you imagine if we could cover that shit up with some cool rock tunes let me put this we would  rule the kings of fucking radio right and extended shits that we could take oh my god that's the  easiest life going the the parts that i didn't bring in yeah is because they were talking about nothing  this is when they weren't talking about nothing okay i would have liked to hear a break about 
[03:24:30]  nothing though i mean the you know worked for seinfeld oh it works for bill and marla works for  they're the seinfeld of radio here's their special last call hey listen you know you are the last  call we're going to take on the show this morning oh really yes which means that you have a job to do  your job is to plug the next show which comes up here on the radio station that's going to be sandy  at uh nine o'clock so can you help us out on that okay stay tuned for standing she's coming up next  at nine o'clock she's terrific like tony the tiger she's great you gotta love that 
[03:25:00]  you don't have to love that no you really don't have to love it  what's the one bill says yeah first of all she said sandy's great not terrific yeah wait wait  what's terrific bill you're a cunt wait but he fucked it up what does tony the tiger say he says great  and what did he say terrific first he said terrific like tony the tiger great great when it's not 
[03:25:30]  like you gotta love that very confused you gotta love it you gotta love it is that it well i figured  that i'd bring in a little yeah that's a good part but can i ask a question really quick what  i don't that's what they have the caller do they don't even they're so afraid to talk about  something to the caller they just have the caller id the next show some kind of yeah what are you  talking about today what's going on in your life anything no no that's that's too edgy that's crazy 
[03:26:00]  what song do you want to hear because these automated assholes can't even play a song no no they can't  yeah they're not allowed to no no what would management say  yeah you can't just play a request no that's crazy what would management say  they would lose their minds yeah right why give the people what they want well bill and marla 
[03:26:30]  this is one more bill and marla tease a great show coming up tomorrow i figured before we left san jose  you guys could get a taste of how they how they get the listener to stay tuned to the next day  because it's very important but they didn't do anything this day well like the day before this  day they would have said tune in to the show we'll be talking about dressing your pet up for  halloween and then marla would say that's right and we'll also be talking about some of your favorite  scary movies 
[03:27:00]  great  juicy juicy  you guys exhausting  maybe he's having a stroke oh it's him and ass  that is the worst bill bill and marla tease in the next show hey coming up tomorrow tune in we're  gonna talk about the tooth fairy it looks like we're not the movie no no it wasn't even the 
[03:27:30]  bad fucking rock movie because we talked about the tooth fairy today right they're not going to  make fun of the movie they're going to talk about the fictional character that you tell your children  takes their baby's teeth from just because the preview for the rocks movies out so they figure  they had to tie it in with a cute little fucking show why don't we i could see them there during  their show prep there's a mo let's see what movies are out here uh um tooth fairy with the rock how  could we use that for the show why don't we do a segment on the tooth fairy that would be great 
[03:28:00]  and i'm sure listeners are going to be able to call up we'll have listeners call up and give us the  stories about uh the tooth fairy well wait a minute we can't have listeners call up because then they're  going to start talking and they might say something inflammatory about the tooth fairy all right  so uh i'll bounce things off of the cunt then and she could talk about it oh jesus christ they 
[03:28:30]  probably have an after show meeting on friday where they plan a week's worth a week's worth of radio  whoa whoa i'm raising my hand sam what's an after show meeting well what is that what is that  that's very confusing to me and i mean actually a lot of radio show hosts when the show is over right  and that you know the commercials start playing run to the elevator and go to get their car no they  actually just call it different they stay in the studio or maybe go to an office why talk to the  equipment's off that's ridiculous you probably believe in the tooth fairy too 
[03:29:00]  they talk to their staff about what they want and then you know what they go back and forth with  some creative ideas and stuff so they actually stay past their actual radio show what's the upside of  this yeah that's weird well the the staff and and the show host can be on the same page  and they don't kind of make it up as they go along but it's not working i don't think that works it's  not working for them so that's true that's a really dumb idea they have i guess the key to radio is 
[03:29:30]  make it up as you go along then that's right sam say you'll let i say what was the first words out of  my mouth today i said it's not about how we don't even know what we're doing today yeah  i said we don't even know what the we're doing today but by the end get i guarantee we get some  done did i not say that today you did and this turned into a great show of course it was  oh my god look how close no thanks to jody rosa and his misinformation about  the truth i don't know i think i was right people i think i was right i'm gonna start telling people 
[03:30:00]  anyway yeah yeah i'll be like yeah i heard on the news and it's like joe de rosa told me but  now you're the news yeah yeah i'll be the news tell me let's do the final clip here oh hey coming  up tomorrow tune in we're gonna talk about the tooth fairy it looks like my son is finally gonna  lose his first tooth oh god and what is why is that funny because it's like you you can picture  that kid's losing what happened you get in a fight no he's a kid he'll have baby teeth and they 
[03:30:30]  fall out dummy oh god it's where it's wiggly oh oh no i would literally rather let wendy williams  deep throat me and then uh be a part of this this show i don't think you want to be a guest on this  show you dude you know hey we got joe de rosa joe de rosa so joe what are you talking about when  you're on stage talking about the tooth fairy huh huh no now joe joe uh tell us some of those jokes 
[03:31:00]  yeah go ahead joe tell us what are your jokes well bill and marla i suffer from depression  oh god not that we're making uh light of uh such a serious um uh disease because we we we suffer  from it too we just choose to ignore it and talk about the tooth fairy the only time i laugh is when  i'm in here and it's fake when i go home it's uh yeah the clown makeup comes off and it's all crying  and razor blades yeah joe but i'm alone i'm alone i cry so hard i shit my pants 
[03:31:30]  oh shit your pants oh juicy my juicy underwear yeah  i'll just fucking put the gun in your mouth put the gun in your mouth no one will ever remember  that you were on radio kill yourself you will not be missed they will put this they'll put the next  fucking guy and girl on the next day probably even call him bill and marla how does that make you feel 
[03:32:00]  i've seen that before too are you kidding oh someone retires and they just throw another  fucking bill and marla in there uh marla marla you up yeah yeah um the program director um  yeah bill killed himself last night oh my god that's terrible well well yeah i guess it is for his family  in a way in a way it is terrible bad for his family good for us we're kind of a lemonade out of the 
[03:32:30]  lemons uh that's what we like doing here and we've got another bill oh what is he like very funny very  funny man uh and no one's even going to you know what the best thing to do is don't talk about the old  bill just go into it like it's still bill don't even acknowledge that he killed himself yeah don't  mention it in the paper or anything you're going to be confused just ignore them yeah ignore it if  someone calls up with it don't take the call just have them request a um a bit for tomorrow and uh 
[03:33:00]  that's how we'll handle it okay but but but but but i think we should talk about suicide it's important  no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no lest we have to get  another marla you don't want that now do you just go on with the new bill you ever see bewitched  you ever notice that um the uh first husband was replaced and no one noticed no one cares  dick york dick sergeant doesn't matter just play ball marla or you'll be next oh you will be next 
[03:33:30]  that's probably in her there's probably a line in her contract that says  avoid actual human contact or interaction at all costs you will be fired if you ever try to act  like a human being while you work on the air at what's it called it's 106.5 even the name is  the same san jose's mix one of the djs and the same yeah and and the mix of what that's what i  fucking love anytime it's called the mix it's not the same songs that the other mix stations play

[03:37:00]  definitely and an email from a listener should i get rid of my dog because my boyfriend is  allergic to it have a great day enjoy peace peace oh you as opposed to what you  fucking cunt war yeah peace peace because you know i'm just in the middle of this crazy hostile  shit every day and we just all need to get along you fucking milquetoast cocksucker that's what was  that tease too yeah the program director says you gotta tease what's coming up tomorrow so people 
[03:37:30]  people are excited but no one's gonna remember they teased that within five minutes you don't think  people are gonna sit at home after a long day's work and say man that was a tough day but at least  tomorrow all right wait wait wait look i know what you're gonna say i forgot what did they just tease  it literally we played it a minute ago that work they're gonna talk about what her son is gonna  get from the tooth fairy i think and then what's the other thing and what else i don't know so i'm 
[03:38:00]  serious i'm not fucking around i'm not that's the only part i remember i totally forgot a tease works if  you can hit him with something where they're like that second thing i forgot do you remember you didn't  say fucking a after she said we're gonna talk about what my son's getting from it it was it was  a boyfriend yes oh the dog the dog uh uh the boyfriend's allergic to the dog wow how can you  discuss that you get rid of the fucking dog what else are you gonna do well the thing is the dog might  be part of the family and it's like you have to make a choice you know what i'm saying 
[03:38:30]  his dick gets chafed after she has him go at it with the peanut butter  pussy he's allergic to dog saliva on his on his glands it gets on his glands but wait  that's technical for head of your cock yeah i thought you were talking about his  asshole no the glands not glands glands what but wait were they saying you get rid of the  boyfriend because you're allergic no they can discuss what you do yeah they're not going to give 
[03:39:00]  away the answer they give away why would anybody listen i'm sure there'll be an outraged  an outrageous caller that says you really should just get rid of the boyfriend yeah coming up tomorrow  we talk about do you divorce your wife because she's on a shitbag radio show  are we done sam yeah but i was actually as i was listening that i was thinking a little suggestion  for this show that maybe we end every show with a tease for tomorrow oh what do you guys think 
[03:39:30]  of incorporating that into the open anthony well let me see if uh how stupid can one person be  i don't think it's a dumb suggestion um might give my whole new group of people could be listening  today and if you tease the right thing maybe they'll listen to tomorrow again and that's how you build  an audience you know right sam how would they know what they're doing on tomorrow's show that's  weird yeah well because they've actually they've done a little prep and they've actually thought 
[03:40:00]  about what will we do tomorrow what if god forbid there's a a huge terrorist attack would they still  talk about their boyfriend being allergic to the dog they'd have to pencil the terrorist attack in  for 7 30 yeah because the boyfriend's dog thing that was on ferrari written days ago for seven you  know hey i gotta get this guy to lie tj in new york go ahead tj yeah um and the time they took  them to fucking tease this dog bit they could have talked about it and bent over with it right yeah 
[03:40:30]  they don't talk long about these things yeah they gotta play songs that's very good they  you know what they would do if there wasn't there's like they do that fake you know that fake  bleeding heart we care thing yeah they probably have slow slow beds like wpix does it yeah it's  time we need to come together i'm gonna miss bill and marla when you wish we could do them again i'm 
[03:41:00]  gonna totally forget about them before the end of the show and the show's over yeah all right  no no elevator how about this ready jack tober right yeah what show did we feature yesterday for real  let me think of the guys i'm trying to think of the guy's name was it something like did start with  a c i can't give any hints i uh uh and we played something he did over and over again right what 
[03:41:30]  was it yeah anybody in this room i don't care i'll take it from anyone they all could jump up to me i've  been listening to a lot of radio shows they just did it yesterday i couldn't name the show i couldn't  name what i don't even know what city we were uh doing yesterday the only thing i remember about  jack tober is that stupid woman who said paul unca oh yeah i remember her oh it was uh tampa  yeah i looked down accidentally tampa i usually try not to look down at the chat thing there because they 
[03:42:00]  they've how bad were they yesterday was it as bad as this they're all yeah exactly the same a lot  of people saying we gotta extend jock tober this year past october can we make november into something  silly jock-vember i don't know how about spook-vember i think we'll be needing to scare people yeah the  guy did something oh they did the coach story but made it sound like it was a grocery store 
[03:42:30]  oh yeah that came back yeah yeah what else no but there was something where we really  beat them up about i've listened to five radio shows today alone ah whatever all right here we  gotta go magical what we got coming up tomorrow on tomorrow's show uh why don't you do it sam okay uh  tomorrow's show jock tober is coming up also we got some jock tober all right yeah yeah 
[03:43:00]  uh whatever's on the page of the paper really i don't fucking know what we're doing tomorrow  but won't we need some kind of bit to go around we know what i'm eating for lunch  opi to start the show uh opi's gonna have some cereal at some point i'm gonna have my bagel turkey  uh sandwich and uh jimmy is not gonna be here should we pencil in a segment where we make fun of  e-rock uh that's just every day yeah but that should be i mean when you want to do it at 6 45 7 15 
[03:43:30]  uh we'll just do it how do you how can you do a show dude i swear to god i have no idea what  we're gonna do tomorrow we'll have we'll probably have a perhaps more than rape  let's do that at 7 25 all of our inside joe we'll have a couple of these i know  nine nine nine nine nine live read somewhere yes yes all right there'll be a dog  fucking oven mitts joke yes that would be a good for 805 uh danny will put some uh pornography up on 
[03:44:00]  the monitor if we could hold off on that until 9 15 so it's not like this so early is this a meeting  yeah but you're disguised as a meeting can i guess what i was just gonna guess about something that'll  happen tomorrow you'll have a caller named like blood cunt exactly all right so we got a solid  show yeah good job guys good good meeting we have a staff meeting today you guys want to come  no i'll uh i don't know what i'm doing are you sure well if you're not busy you come to the staff 
[03:44:30]  what time is that oh like what 11 30 why would it be at 11 30 you guys gotta wait around an hour  for a meeting late yeah well i mean holy shit i feel bad for you guys by 11 30 oh halfway  through my first beer and falling asleep on the couch with the beer between my legs you drink a  beer at 11 in the morning um well to me it's probably like the afternoon okay yeah because  you know it seems like because i woke up early so 11 30 to me is like like three o'clock to a lot 
[03:45:00]  of people that makes sense so that's why that's why i drink in the morning this is a beautiful  rationalization yeah however you want to justify that yes hey coming from derosa shut up you former  drunk one of the bosses one of the bosses came by at 10 45 and asked if uh you and aunt were not  working they're like they're not in the studio anymore i said no long gone how'd they come by  at 10 45 when yesterday oh yesterday i thought you meant today i'm like it's not even 10 45 yesterday 
[03:45:30]  take a delorean although i mean let me tell you how dumb management is okay i take pleasure in this  these guys want to talk to us almost every day but they make the mistake of walking down that really  long hall which gives us plenty of time to get out of here and skedaddle if they went that way i'm not  saying which way they should go but they certainly are stupid when they walk down the long hall  expecting us to still be in the studio by the time they get here i run through these hallways like john
