<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion about the logistical difficulties of fulfilling listener requests for "Wow" stickers, focusing on the unpredictable postage costs.  The hosts then excitedly announced that Patrice O'Neill and Colin Quinn would be appearing as guests, recounting a funny story about a staff member's clumsy response to Quinn's last-minute offer to be on the show.  A brief sports interlude touched upon the Yankees' playoff elimination and the Mets' remaining playoff hopes.  A caller from Boston then complained that the show had been preempted on WBCN for a golf tournament benefiting wounded soldiers, leading to the hosts venting their frustration about SiriusXM preempting their own Saturday programming, specifically a planned “secret show” featuring Anthony and Danny.  The segment continued with some lighthearted ribbing of Jimmy’s sniffles and a discussion of the inferior quality of certain tissues.  They teased an upcoming segment debunking David Blaine’s magic tricks.  Anthony also shared details about his new relationship, expressing some anticipation regarding Patrice O’Neill’s reaction to the news. The show concluded with a segment mocking comedian Jeffrey Ross’s early elimination from “Dancing with the Stars,” playing a humorous clip of Ross’s post-elimination interview.  Finally, a caller from Canada was teased for the next segment, with the intriguing suggestion of a "hostage situation" to grab the audience's attention.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And there's the urgent music.  Yes.  Which means something urgent is going to happen.  It's only mean one thing.  It's the opening anthony show.  Just like the listeners, we're looking to see what's going to happen.  Yeah.  That's how this game works every day.  It's a tug of war. 
[00:00:30]  You know, some of the listeners.  We got a busy show today on this Whippermouth Wednesday.  Is it Whippermouth Wednesday ready?  It is Wednesday, isn't it?  Wow.  Better be.  These Wednesdays are just flying by.  Yeah.  It seems like yesterday was Wednesday.  No, that was about a week ago, I would guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, get those stickers out there.  I see a lot of them these days. 
[00:01:00]  You see more and more stickers?  Yes.  Makes me feel good.  It's not great.  The listeners here in New York, is it easy to get a wow sticker?  How do you do that?  I believe they reach out to us here at KROQ and we will send it to you.  What's KROQ?  W-O-X-R-K, the flagship station of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh!  Right on!  So what do you do?  You go to ONAradio.com?  Yes, sir.  And you send us an email and we will send you the wow sticker.  What about the people that write me all the time and say, I sent in an envelope two to 
[00:01:30]  three months ago and I never got my sticker.  They're lying.  Is that just like some of the envelopes falling behind a desk or something?  For the most part, we're doing good with this?  There might be some incompetence here.  Hmm.  Well, yeah.  Some.  All right, there's a lot.  Yeah.  I would say to those people, send another envelope.  What is the stamp these days?  40?  I don't even know.  I don't know.  It's a 13 cent stamp?  What is it up to? 
[00:02:00]  I will guess.  13.  I will guess.  This is my guess.  That stamps are now 46.  I'm going with 40.  I'm looking around for help.  42.  I'm going to go with 42.  Jimmy says 42.  Thumbs up?  Yeah.  Why is he writing 49?  I just know it's one stamp and then I got to put another one.  I got to put on a two cent stamp.  Know what I do? 
[00:02:30]  Oh, but when they change the amount to it, the stamps, a lot of people use the two cent  stamp.  The post is making a lot of money off me because I got all these stamps and I'm not really sure  if they're 42 cent stamps.  So I just put two of them.  Put two on?  I just put two on.  So my letters are going out for 84 cents a pop because I'm not really sure and I don't  feel like asking anybody because there's no little thing on the stamp saying it's a 42  cent.  It's just like a flag or something.  So I'm paranoid.  I want to make sure my bills get there on time and all that. 
[00:03:00]  If there's no amount on it, then you have those forever stamps.  Well, the forever are the...  But they're good.  The Liberty Bell.  Yeah, those are the bells, right?  Okay.  I've seen one with flag, though.  Hell, I know more than I thought about this stamp thing.  But I've seen the forever ones with just a flag.  Have you?  I haven't seen that.  I thought the brown or copper forevers were the Liberty Bell.  Hmm.  Ah.  All right.  I just tape a buck to the envelope and I go, you sort it out.  Yeah.  Distribute what's left over for Christmas. 
[00:03:30]  Big dollar bill just taped there.  Give it to the crow.  It's not even a dollar bill.  You got to go with the coins.  Yeah.  Just make the envelope nice and heavy on one side.  They probably call you the rich guy down at the post office.  He's got the two-stamper again.  Look at him.  Looks like the hoarder is sending out more mail.  Opie and Anthony, 877-212-ON-A.  Also, onaradio.com.  Yeah, we're all over.  We got Patrice O'Neill coming in today.  Patrice O'Neill.  And then, like, the phone rang as we were getting ready for the show today and Colin Quinn called. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, before we were even on the air, Colin decided to call in.  And he was asking if it's okay if he comes in today.  Of course it is.  Yeah, this is like a hang.  We don't know what we're doing on a regular basis.  Okay, if I can come in.  See what you morons are doing.  Yeah, apparently we asked Steve, who took the call, what he was doing.  And Steve said in between his mumbling and giggling, he couldn't really tell.  Yeah.  Apparently Colin was mumbling and giggling. 
[00:04:30]  And Steve did the dumbest thing.  Oh, my God.  You know, right?  I know exactly what you're going to say.  You know, right?  Because I thought it was very dumb, too.  E-Rock used to do something similar to this to me.  Right.  So Steve's on the phone with Colin Quinn.  He leans into where we're just kind of, you know, preparing for the show.  And he goes, oh, you don't mind if Colin Quinn comes in.  Right.  And I look at Steve to answer him.  And he's on the phone with Colin Quinn.  And what are you supposed to do?  At that point, Steve, what am I supposed to say? 
[00:05:00]  Tell that loser no.  Why would you do it that way?  That's stupid.  No, no.  The reason is I knew the answer was yes.  Oh, now he's a mind reader.  Not necessarily, my friend.  It depends on when Patrice was getting here and all that stuff.  I probably would have said, you know, give us the first hour to kind of just warm up  and get the show going.  And then, yeah, Colin, come on in around 7.  That's probably what I would have said if you didn't have the phone open so Colin could  hear what I was saying.  Yeah.  Well, the answer is usually yes. 
[00:05:30]  So, you know, it's just one of those things.  But you can't assume no one does the, you don't mind as the person that you might mind  about is listening in on the conversation.  I seriously thought it's Colin, you know.  You're always saying, Colin, come on up whenever.  So it was always like, yeah.  Because we don't mean it.  Yeah, we feel bad for the show.  Iraq used to do that all the time with the photographs.  There'd be somebody that would come into the studio.  We'd interview him.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  And a lot of times I don't, you know, I don't need a picture with somebody.  But Iraq would go, Ant, you want to take a picture with, you know, whoever it is?  And they're right there.  So I can't say no.  Like, I could give a crap about this person.  So then I have to get up and take a picture with them.  Like, Iraq, could you not ask?  I go, when I want to take a picture with somebody, I'll make sure.  Or I'll go, Iraq, get a camera.  I want a picture.  Or Jimmy, let me use your camera, you know, and take a picture.  But for the most part, there you go. 
[00:06:30]  All right.  Hey, I want to give out my condolences to the both of you, even though Jimmy makes believe  he's not.  Oh, Jesus.  The Yankees are officially eliminated.  So to all the Yankee fans out there, I'm sorry.  I think we knew that was coming.  Well, it's now official.  Yeah, mathematically eliminated.  Mets holding on with their fingernails still.  Yeah, they won last night.  Yeah, game and a half behind the Phillies and what, a game up on the Brewers for the wild 
[00:07:00]  card, I do believe.  I don't think anything really changed there.  Joe Torre's got to be giggling his ass off.  Yeah.  Giggling his prostate off.  Yeah.  He's, you know.  I never understood that move.  Because Torre is just such a likable guy, and he proved that he could get the job done.  Keep the guy in there.  The team loves him.  That was a transfer of power play.  That was the Steinbrenner kids taking over, and I don't think they wanted any of dad's baggage 
[00:07:30]  around, even if that baggage is Joe Torre.  I think they wanted to start fresh, and oof, boy, sure started in the basement.  You know, it's the perfect scenario for Torre.  Yeah.  He leaves.  The Dodgers, they're, I don't follow the Dodgers, I'm not going to lie to you, but I  think they're in first place, right?  They're having a really good year.  And he got Manny.  Right, right.  Yeah, he's bringing some of his boys over there.  Yeah.  And then, you know, the Yankees, first time not in the playoffs in 15 years? 
[00:08:00]  15 years.  Something like that?  Oof.  That's perfect for Joe Torre.  Yeah.  That's exactly what Joe Torre wanted to happen.  That's what anyone wants when your job is, when you're let go from your job, you want  the next guy to come in and just completely screw up.  Yeah, he'll never admit that's what he wanted, because he's a really, really nice guy, but  secretly, he's kind of smiling and kind of enjoying the fact that the Yankees are out  of it.  Oh, look, we've got to deal with them.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  Sam in Boston.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sam. 
[00:08:30]  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  Sam.  Hello, boys.  What's going on, Sam?  Hey.  You guys aren't on in Boston today.  Yeah, it's, boy, we love WBCN.  We truly do, and we've got some major, major fans up there, but they're doing a golf tournament  today for a very good cause.  It's, I believe, for wounded soldiers, right?  Yeah, they're building homes for our soldiers. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  And it's the first golf tournament they've done.  So, they moved Toucher and Rich, the afternoon guys, down to do mornings today.  So, basically, what WBCN is doing to our listeners is giving them a chance to find another  show to listen to.  Oh, lovely.  So, are you guys going to be on when they're on at, what, three?  You know, that's a good idea.  Why do we do that?  We can still do that.  Replay it?  Yes, why not?  Come on, that's when I go home.  I can listen to you instead of going to work.  They ain't doing that.  That was the solution, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  I mean, we'll be back on tomorrow, but it's just dumb programming, to be honest with you.  This radio world is just all effed up.  They don't know what the hell they're doing.  You know what's got me more pissed than that is the fact that SiriusXM, whatever the hell you  want to call it these days, is preempting a lot of our Saturday programming.  Right.  Now, most shows and stations, channels, the Saturday programming doesn't really matter  all that much.  Believe me. 
[00:10:00]  It's just the way it is.  People are busy on Saturdays.  But we have the Saturday night virus every so often.  A show comes on that people kind of want to hear.  You know, Patrice is very good at it.  Bill Burr, very good.  Laszlo's show is great.  Yep.  And now...  We pop in every once in a while and do a little time.  Well, that's something I want to bring up.  Yeah.  Because this Saturday, we're being preempted for college football, which isn't even on  our channel. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  Apparently, they need bandwidth.  Right.  So, they just cut our channel down to, like, no bandwidth and leave an announcement that  plays over and over and over again that the channel's off the air.  Oh, so they're not even using the channel?  No.  And then they play the football on another channel that they pump bandwidth into.  Right.  So, our channel just goes, the virus will return, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  The virus will return.  And let me tell you what was preempted this Saturday. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Secret Danny Anthony show.  I got preempted on my own goddamn channel.  It was going to be the secret show.  Another secret show with me and Danny.  We're going to go on, get drunk, the drunken secret show, where we go on, we drink, and  we just BS about what's going on.  And tell secrets.  And tell little secrets.  It's wonderful.  It's a fun show to do.  Mm-hmm.  The listeners enjoy it.  They get a very candid view of us and the show and behind the scenes at the house. 
[00:11:30]  Things like that.  You know, you get a few beers in me.  Hoo-hoo.  I can't shut up.  Really?  Yes.  Really.  Yes.  I think we've all seen that.  Ron and Fez get the benefit from that.  Ron and Fez get to see that.  Laszlo sees that.  Everyone gets the benefit from that, except for us here, you know, the show that you're  on.  It's a fine line, because if I did start drinking on this show, you'd have to have an intervention,  so I wouldn't be drinking on it.  Why?  We didn't have to back in the day. 
[00:12:00]  Well, that was 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  That's well into drinking time.  Yeah, true.  By probably eight hours.  True.  True.  You all right, Jimmy?  Jimmy's blowing his schnozzola.  Ah, cha-cha-cha.  You can have a raw nose, though.  Why don't you get some nice, like, fluffy tissues?  You should.  What is that?  Paper towel?  He's using, like...  Oh, no.  He's using Starbucks napkins.  Yeah, they're not the softest things.  Nothing worse than when you were a kid, you'd go into the bathroom and had to blow your 
[00:12:30]  nose with a brown paper towel.  You have a little tender, little kid nose, and you're pretty much just pulling it off  with the paper towel.  It would fold and give you paper cuts on the side of your nose.  Ow.  Ow.  Hey, before Patrice said, Collins, get here.  Cheeky.  We got an exclusive on this dumb David Blaine.  Oh, this is just...  We'll do it after the break.  Such crap.  But the guy is a fraud, and we'll explain after the break.  And Sam was down there, and he actually got to interview David Blaine. 
[00:13:00]  He's doing another dumb trick here in New York where he's hanging upside down.  I call this one the dumbest of them all.  Yeah, absolutely.  But it's a fraud.  Simple as that.  And boy, I didn't know Patrice was coming in today.  I'm going to have to deal with Patrice now today.  Yes.  Because this is the first time he's been in since I've had a relationship.  Well, he was very excited.  He was very excited that you and Jill got together.  He was very excited that I was kind of getting away from what he's used to seeing me with. 
[00:13:30]  I think they're called Suicide Girls.  Yeah.  He likes to call them Suicide Girls.  Suicide Girls.  And, you know, I was with a woman who had a career and things like that.  And now I've got to explain to Patrice what the deal was, and I'm sure I'll get some advice from him.  He's going to get a little more out of it.  What do you think he's going to do?  What do you think he's going to do?  What do you think?  Do you think he's going to be mad at me?  Nah, he's going to point his finger and... 
[00:14:00]  What do you...  What the...  I don't...  Explain Patrice.  Yeah.  He'll never be angry at someone for cheating on a woman.  Good point, Jimmy.  Hey, let's clear the field so we can get to some of these things.  Clear the field.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  Well, we've got to finish something we started.  Jeffrey Ross, a friend of the show as well.  He's on Dancing with the Stars.  Oh, is he?  When he was picked for Dancing with the Stars, we all were in shock. 
[00:14:30]  Not going to lie to you.  A lot of us said, why, why, why was he picked for this show?  Well, Jeffrey Ross, the first to be eliminated from Dancing with the Stars.  It went down last night.  The couple with the lowest combined total and therefore leaving after only one dance is...  Jeffrey, an editor.  After one dance. 
[00:15:00]  Which means, Kim and Mark, you're safe.  One dance.  Huh?  After one dance.  That's it.  Beat it.  And then, you know, Jeff got sad.  Hey, guys.  It was a very, very short but sweet journey nonetheless.  I patched it all.  What a nightmare.  Can I point out, is this your family over here, all of whom are wearing eye patches in solidarity?  They told me editor was going to be easy on the eyes. 
[00:15:30]  That's pretty funny.  I'm very sorry.  I figured for sure it would be your husband who poked me in the eye, not you.  All right.  Easy on the eyes.  That's funny.  She poked him in the eye.  Ross is a very funny guy.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's good with those puns.  You know what?  I've got to say that this has been the most fun I've ever...  This is the clip that we'll be making fun of for a while with Jeffrey behind the scenes  when we see him at the cellar and whatnot. 
[00:16:00]  Jeffrey Ross getting sappy, Jimmy.  He didn't get sappy.  Yeah, he got a little sappy.  About what?  Not dancing well?  I'm going to bite his face.  He got a little sappy.  All right.  You know what?  I've got to say that this has been the most fun I've ever had.  I'll probably cry after this, but I want everyone to know that if I can do it, you can do it.  Do what?  No, he didn't say that.  Do what?  He didn't do anything.  We all know we can lose.  If I can do it, you can too.  Lose.  You can say that when you win, Jeff.  He twirled across the dance floor a couple times. 
[00:16:30]  There is now...  I want to put a pirate eye patch on.  A Molotov cocktail right in this video, Jim.  I think he's calling in today.  Very nice.  Do you have anything that you want to say to your beautiful partner, Edita, here?  Well, my one regret is that I don't get to dance with Edita anymore.  She is a champion in waiting.  She came in second last season, so I feel bad for her.  I think she is a first-class, world-class human being.  Very lovely.  He is schmaltz. 
[00:17:00]  Please support Edita and her nine children back in Poland.  That was funny.  There goes our pal, Jeffrey Ross.  He should be doing some soft shoe.  Short but sweet.  Yeah, what a...  Like I said, very schmaltzy.  Spreading the love.  First-class human being?  How?  Yeah, well, she dances.  I'm sure she's nice and all, but first-class human being, that's pretty up there.  Jonas Salk. 
[00:17:30]  There you go.  There's a first-class human being.  Those little polio kids.  Actually, he won.  He was only on two more episodes than I was.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  The call today comes from Canada.  Everett from Canada.  I don't know if they're going to hang through the break.  The question, is the hostage situation over?  Oh, I'll tell you after the break.  This is being asked every day now, Anthony.  Every day.  Tell you after the break.  Hey, I like that tease. 
[00:18:00]  Hope you and Anthony, stay there. </pre>
