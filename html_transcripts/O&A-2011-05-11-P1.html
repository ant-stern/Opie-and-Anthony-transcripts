<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with Reg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton (who arrives late due to a jetway malfunction, as later recounted via his tweets) introducing the show and its characteristically unrestrained style.  They initially discuss a "jet man" video, quickly transitioning to Anthony's frustrations with a proposed Islanders hockey arena and casino near his home, including a dispute with his season ticket representative. The proposed name sparks a humorous tangent about potentially naming it after the Long Island Serial Killers, imagining the killers' potential outrage.  The conversation then touches on an Islanders Game 7, former players, and the stark contrast between the realities of a music career and their radio success.  They also delve into gossip surrounding Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver's divorce.

A major segment focuses on a viral video of a naked, racist man causing a disturbance on a New York City subway.  The hosts detail the video, analyzing the bystanders’ reactions and the lack of widespread panic. This leads to a discussion on desensitization to violence and the future of real-time broadcasting in an age of ubiquitous video recording.  Former law enforcement officer Kenny joins the show, offering his perspective on the police officer's handling of the incident, which segues into a fictionalized, action-movie-style anecdote about a police officer in a fast-food restaurant.

The show then shifts to lighter fare, beginning with discussions of minor inconveniences like an overflowing pool skimmer, jokingly termed a "white people problem."  They recall Warren Haynes’ recent in-studio appearance and jam session, highlighting Haynes' guitar skills. The absence of Eric "E-Rock," on vacation in Cuba, is noted.  The hosts discuss Patrice O'Neal and Warren Haynes' impromptu performance of "Going Down Slow," commenting on O'Neal's surprisingly good vocals.  Jimmy recounts his Kentucky Derby experience, sharing anecdotes about jockeys (their surprising muscularity, weight requirements, and physical demands), horse care, drug use in horse racing, and encounters with celebrities like Wayne Brady, Wynonna Judd, Erin Andrews, Lindsay Vaughn, and a notably unpleasant Tom Brady and his entourage.  He also describes a missed opportunity to speak with Joe Torre.  The "most annoying 30 seconds" contest winners are announced.  Attempts to reach E-Rock via phone fail.

A significant portion is dedicated to a prank call to E-Rock in the Bahamas, filled with humorous and crude remarks about his alleged vacation behavior and physical appearance. This is interjected with discussions of a radio contest malfunction and caller interactions.  A past Larry King interview segment, focusing on a question about the importance of a skateboard to a skateboarder, is revisited and mocked.  The conversation touches upon Osama bin Laden's death, Rosie O’Donnell’s comments on due process, and the authenticity of circulating death photos.  Comedian Vic Henley is a guest in studio during this segment.

A caller, David from North Carolina, discusses conspiracy theories surrounding bin Laden's sea burial, leading to humorous and offensive banter about the burial process.  Vic Henley briefly promotes his new CD, "Lou's Cruise."  The show then features an in-studio interview with actor Paul Bettany, promoting "Priest 3D."  The conversation covers Bettany's past roles, his wife Jennifer Connelly (including humorous anecdotes about their relationship), his views on the British Royal Family, experiences with paparazzi (including a physical altercation), and his displeasure with Josh Lucas, who allegedly sent inappropriate emails to Opie's girlfriend.  The interview is highly informal and punctuated with jokes and comedic interjections.  The segment concludes with further promotion of Bettany's film and Henley's CD.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's a guy?  Look at him.  Wow. That is cool.  Cool.  That's how we start today. Good morning.  So what was that? Over the Grand Canyon?  Yeah, some guy flying with jet wings.  He's got, like, these carbon fiber wings just strapped to his back. 
[00:01:30]  And it's got little jets on him.  And then he jumps out of a helicopter.  Yep.  And then flies, like, over the Grand Canyon and then lands at a parachute.  That is really cool.  It looked so cool.  It was like.  How far did he go?  That looked fake.  I don't know.  I don't know.  How far did he go?  Look at him.  He's just, like, Buck Rogers.  And he's got a tail on it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's got little, like, winglets on the side of the wings.  Right.  So he's got, like, some control surfaces.  And he's just fucking, uh, he's flying. 
[00:02:00]  Jet man.  Who allowed that to happen?  Yeah, right?  You throw rockets at the Grand Canyon, they'll arrest you.  Yeah.  But you're allowed to just jump out of a helicopter in this jet thing?  You're allowed to potentially cause an explosion if you crash.  That's awesome.  Yeah, that is pretty cool.  Why was he doing that?  Uh, to be, like, the coolest guy ever.  You think he's the coolest guy ever?  Uh, right now he is, yeah.  And Breitling watches, I guess, paid for it. 
[00:02:30]  Wow.  Look at him.  He just falls out of a helicopter with these wings on.  And then he starts up these jet engines.  Right.  It's all on video.  It's all over the internet.  And there he goes.  He's flying like a motherfucker.  And then it just looks like a fucking jet.  How fast is he going?  I don't know.  Uh, 190.  190?  190 miles an hour.  Wow.  That's got to be some view.  And the feeling that you are flying like that, because, I mean, it's just him in the air flying.  Yes.  It's different than a hang glider. 
[00:03:00]  It's different than, uh, parachuting.  Look, he's climbing.  He's just...  And then he comes down...  Parachute.  Yeah, then he comes down on a chute.  Lands right on the mark.  You think we'll be commuting with this thing soon?  Uh, that'd be great.  How great would that be?  Get into work real quick.  Let him be lands right on his mark.  Right on his mark?  And kind of plants his face a little bit, but...  But what is...  It's hard with that big wing on your back.  Yeah, it's going to knock you forward, right?  Look at those...  He's got four jet engines.  Little jet engines on that thing. 
[00:03:30]  How did he figure that out?  Just amazing.  Swiss jet man.  I am the Swiss jet man.  CNN just showed some footage of that, so it'll be all over the TV today.  Cool as hell.  That is really cool.  That's some Buck Rogers shit.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  What's going on, Anthony?  Hanging.  Hanging.  Hi, good morning, everybody.  People like getting their good mornings from us.  I read it on Twitter all the time.  They appreciate it.  Without a hint of sarcasm.  Yes. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, I hear there's going to be a new coliseum for the Islanders, yes.  Yeah.  A lot of people congratulating me like I'm an owner or something.  Uh, why the congratulations for you when, if this plan does go through, there will be  a casino virtually, um, actually, literally ten minutes from my house.  Really?  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Would you go to those type of casinos?  Uh, well, it's not going to be just a slot machine casino like they have up at Yonkers.  Uh.  I think they're talking table games.  Oh, really? 
[00:04:30]  So, uh, to go there, to maybe get a few hands of blackjack, maybe play some poker.  If you have that itch.  If I got the itch, since they took the online poker away from me.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, and it's ten minutes away.  So to do that, I don't know.  I might drop in.  Are you going to vote for it?  This could be the complete end of any, uh, income that I have saved up over, uh, the  past 17 years.  Uh, I'm.  Well, I guess, I guess Nassau County has to vote for this thing. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I guess I'm one of the voters.  Don't congratulate, don't congratulate me, because I told my ticket guy to go fuck himself  last week, so don't congratulate me.  I'm still a hockey fan.  I'm still an Islanders fan, but the guy wants me to re-up.  And, uh, I think I told you, my old ticket guy, after he got fired, because he didn't  get his bonus, even though he was supposed to get a bonus, but it was something that  the Islanders organization was finagling to save even more money.  Yeah, save some cash.  So they were trying to fuck over some people, and, uh.  Of course.  So they fired people before they could give them their bonus. 
[00:05:30]  So then that guy called me and just gave me the fucking skinny.  So then I used that skinny, uh, against the new guy.  And he had nothing to say but, ha-ba-ba-ba, ha-ba-ba, ha-ba-ba, ha-ba-ba-ba, ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  See, if you're a season ticket holder, you get, you know, in my case, I got nice seats.  Yeah.  But you get kind of a discount.  You know what I mean?  You're not paying face value.  I think my tickets, they say $150 a piece on them, right?  But if you're buying a package, they're not $150 per ticket per game. 
[00:06:00]  No.  You get a nice little discount.  But then the team was doing so bad that they started giving away seats right around my area for, like, pennies on the dollar of what I was paying.  And that's what I told the new guy, and he didn't deny it.  I'm like, why would I be a season ticket holder next year when I could pick and choose a bunch of games to go to knowing that I could get some nice discounts on the seats?  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Right around where I sit.  Why would you screw over the season ticket holders?  Those are the guys that are spending a lot of money up front before you know if the team is going to be good or not.  Yeah, that's your bread and butter.  So then, you know, in the case of the Islanders this past year, the team wasn't that good, although they had a really good second half or whatever.  That's getting a little too deep.  So when you know you're not a playoff team anymore, then the organization goes, well, we just got to get fucking bodies in the seat.  Yeah.  So drop the price until you see people coming through the doors. 
[00:07:00]  And guess who fucking suffers at that point?  The people that bought the season tickets.  Exactly.  So don't congratulate me because I told my ticket guy to go fuck himself.  Go fuck yourself.  And if he comes crawling back to me with something fair, then sure, I'll be sitting in my seats next year.  Well, they're looking to take Belmont Park over there, a little property by Belmont Racetrack, and build a new coliseum for the Islanders and a minor league ball field.  Right.  And a casino, a big complex down there. 
[00:07:30]  And I gather still horse racing.  It is important, Belmont.  Belmont Stakes is run at Belmont.  Well, you don't need a new track, do you?  No, no, that track's a pretty good track.  Although it does need some upgrading.  I'll tell you that much.  So maybe they just knock the whole thing down and start fresh.  Start fresh?  Wow, that would be a lot of fucking money.  Holy shit.  Oh, it would?  Yeah.  I think all they need to do, because the shell of it is great, but when you go inside Belmont, it feels like you were there in the 80s. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's still just...  I haven't been there in years, so I don't even know.  They ought to gussy it up a bit.  The track is nice, like the outside and the midfield and everything like that is nice.  Yeah, that's easy, though.  Yeah, yeah, it's grass.  It's a fucking couple of Mexicans and some kind of muddy...  Some kind of muddy...  Some kind of muddy dirt thing, sand, whatever.  The car goes around with the rake.  It's great.  Yeah, it looks beautiful.  Just rake it, it'll look nice.  But inside, there's cement fucking girders and shit with old fucking guys leaning against them, 
[00:08:30]  pissed off that they lost every race.  Hitting their hand with the newspaper.  Son of a bitch.  I had the one, the three, and the five.  It came in three, five, and then the eight horse, and then the one would have come in if...  All right, you lost.  Everyone has a story, right?  Everyone's got a story.  So that's one of the big things hitting today.  The Islanders might stay on Long Island.  Yeah.  But that stupid lighthouse thing?  Gone.  Gone. 
[00:09:00]  The lighthouse project.  Why were they calling it that, anyway?  Just because it's...  It's kind of a Long Island thing.  Long Island, known for lighthouses.  Yeah, the light...  What are they...  Even though the NASA Coliseum is just in a horrendous, horrible area in the middle of nowhere,  there's no water anywhere is near the Coliseum.  Yeah, I know.  Is the new name for the project the Serial Killer Project?  Because we're known for that now.  There you go.  That's like whatever Long Island's known for.  That would be a great logo on a sports team jersey.  The Serial Killer Project.  Yeah, the Serial Killers. 
[00:09:30]  The Long Island Serial Killers.  Maybe that could be the minor league ball team they're putting in.  But you know what?  Knowing this stupid world we live in, the Serial Killers will be pissed off,  and they'll fucking have to rally and say, it's not...  You know...  You know...  Yes.  What's his name?  Rifkin.  Right.  Joel Rifkin is the spokesman for the Long Island Serial Killer Association,  and he's very offended.  And Wong did apologize to him.  They insist they changed the name of the New York Serial Killers to something else. 
[00:10:00]  To something...  Of course that would happen.  That's exactly what happens in this dumb world.  It wouldn't even be from the people all shocked.  No.  It would be from serial killers.  You know, these people grew up with problems,  and it drove them to kill many people,  and it doesn't mean they're necessarily bad people.  Right.  And the stigma that you're perpetuating with the serial killer name,  we like being called mass takers of life. 
[00:10:30]  Not even mass murderers?  No, no.  Mass takers of life is better.  Actually, they're giving death to people.  Mass givers of death.  Fucking assholes we live with.  It's ridiculous.  Gerg.  They've pretty much changed every sports team at this point, right?  They did.  God.  They really did.  And no one thought twice about the dumb name.  No one gave a shit.  Why do you fucking cater to the minority in this country?  No one cared. 
[00:11:00]  Why do that?  Fucking no.  I got to acknowledge, speaking of hockey, we're going to a game seven here.  Detroit?  Fucking Detroit was down.  I think they were down three games to none,  and now they forced a game fucking seven against the Sharks.  Yeah, huh?  I didn't watch the game.  I went to bed early.  I don't watch any of that out-of-state shit.  Huh?  No?  If the Rangers were in there or something.  You had to say the Rangers?  Well, it would happen.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:11:30]  I know the Rangers are no fucking prizes, but I would watch a good Ranger.  And the Islanders, of course, but that's such a fucking just non-event that would never happen.  I'm sorry.  It's just awful.  Now, the team is, we got a good young team.  Yeah?  It's going to take a few years.  I know you've heard this all before, Anthony and everybody else,  but we had a really good second half of the season.  Got a good young team.  I'm not kidding. 
[00:12:00]  Got a good young team out there.  So even though I told my ticket guy to go fuck himself, I'm like,  oh, God, I hope I'm doing the right thing.  But how many young teams have they had since 1980, frigging whatever it was?  They train everyone away.  I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah.  Fucking Rolison is standing on his head for the Tampa Bay Lightning.  Guess what team he started with this past year?  The Islanders, huh?  That's right.  And then they trade him, and he's thinking, I'm 43.  My career is pretty much over.  And now he's got a Stanley Cup run.  Fuck these young kids. 
[00:12:30]  Why don't they get Bobby Nystrom and Clark Gillies back?  Have you seen Clark Gillies lately?  Oh, Jesus.  Got to kick him out of FH Riley's.  Clark, it's time to go home.  No, you don't think you can fucking turn it?  You don't think you can make some turns on them skates?  I got to ask my brother how his friendship with Pat LaFontaine's going.  Pat LaFontaine.  He's eaten at FH a few times.  Yeah.  And then he might be a little lonely because he's always asking Brett, hey, you want to 
[00:13:00]  go fishing?  Oh, really?  You want to go fishing?  You want to go fishing?  Pat LaFontaine.  He's trying to make a little friendship with Brett because I don't think he, I don't know.  I don't know if he has a lot of friends.  It's amazing.  Fucking 30 years later, those guys are still like known celebrities.  Oh, yeah.  They walk in any place.  Everybody on Long Island knows them.  Well, that's it for us, though.  Yeah, I know.  What else is Long Island known for?  Serial killers.  Serial killers, old school Islanders, and Billy Joel.  I think that's it. 
[00:13:30]  That's pretty much it.  I wouldn't even put D. Schneider in that category.  No, you can't go too deep.  Any money.  You can't do any money.  You can't even do any money.  No.  Back in the day.  Although I was leaving FH Raleigh's over the weekend, and I was laughing my ass off,  and no offense to this band, but the bar next door had a band.  Bar next door to me was.  And as I'm crossing the street to my car, Two Tickets to Paradise was cranking out of the bar.  Whoa.  And I'm thinking, this band probably thinks they're the shit. 
[00:14:00]  They sounded good.  They were covering a little Eddie Money.  But I guarantee they think it's just a matter of time before they make it.  They're going to make it.  They're going to make it doing Eddie Money covers in Huntington there on Main Street or whatever.  And I told my girl, I'm like, you know how many bands right now on Long Island are playing Two Tickets to Paradise?  Oof.  Do you miss that world?  Oh, no.  It was fun. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  But after a while, you start really do thinking.  You know, it's great in your 20s especially.  But the second you start cracking 30, you start thinking, hey, what's going to happen?  I would bet 40s for these guys.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I would bet 40s.  Once you do that, you pretty much got to just tell yourself, it ain't going to happen.  I can make a career out of music, but it's going to be a different road.  I'm not going to be there on the big stage at giant arenas playing my own music to an adoring crowd. 
[00:15:00]  I'm going to be playing a lot of shit clubs.  For a long time.  A lot of cover tunes.  And, you know, eking out a living that way.  I'm going to have a drinking problem.  Right.  So, yeah, it's a rough life.  And then you're just loading your equipment in and out of the club thinking,  Wouldn't it be great to have, like, roadies and light techs and be in a big place like the Coliseum or the Garden or something like that?  I think you just realize, ah, I think this has happened. 
[00:15:30]  I hope somebody calls for having me on a radio gig.  Oh, yeah.  And the rest is history.  Yeah.  TMZ reporting Maria Shriver, excuse me, called Schwarzenegger unstable.  He was the governor, wasn't he?  Unstable.  What do you mean he was unstable?  Well, he did seem a little off.  But I think it's just the divorce ploy.  Right.  They start posturing very early in the proceedings and trying to make the other person look a little silly. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  So unstable.  He could be, though.  I mean, you've seen him on interviews and stuff where he's just groping women.  And he's known as a notorious womanizer.  Well, it just shows you that everything we know is just bullshit.  Weren't they happy when he was the governor?  So that was a fake thing they were doing, right?  Of course.  That was all phony just for the sake of his career.  And they probably had a little talk behind closed doors like, okay, look, we both know this is pretty much over. 
[00:16:30]  But let's not do it until I leave office.  Look, Hillary stayed with Bill.  Will you stay with me?  And she did, you know, I guess.  What is she hinting at?  So she's probably looking for some kind of...  And she's got, like, Kennedy money.  So she doesn't need the money.  But I think it's more of a...  I think at that point it becomes like a spite thing.  Right.  It doesn't matter how much money you have.  You just want to fuck the other person over.  Right.  And if he was womanizing, then she's...  I was...  Oh, God.  I almost said something stupid. 
[00:17:00]  I'll say it now.  How would he get away with womanizing?  And then you'd think Clinton, so...  Yeah, of course.  Got away with it for a long fucking time.  And he...  Apparently they weren't even together for quite some time now.  And they both ditched their wedding rings.  Oh, really?  Look at us.  We're in a little gossip segment.  I like this.  Ooh, gossip.  From what I read, Opie, my reporting is telling me, my sources are saying that they haven't  been wearing their wedding rings in quite some time. 
[00:17:30]  And Maria Shriver actually put out a very cryptic YouTube video about...  She wanted advice from her fans on how to move along into the next phase of her life.  Really?  And during this video, she was not wearing a wedding ring.  So, uh, this raising a lot of questions there, Opie.  A lot of questions.  Da-da-da-da.  Yeah!  And, uh, when we come back, we're gonna talk about Britney Spears and what she's up to lately. 
[00:18:00]  You should have said Justin Bieber.  And Justin Bieber.  And Lady Gaga.  And Lady Gaga coming up later in the hour.  Because we just plug things, and then we talk about them for two seconds and plug more things.  We never actually do anything.  Never do the story.  It's one big tease, that show.  So, who's the bimbo that's gonna come out and talk about something now?  Oh.  Where did you get that info?  That scares me.  I troll around all the news sites at night.  You don't do that pop culture shit.  No, I troll around all the news sites at night. 
[00:18:30]  But usually I get stuck on Drudge, and I get stuck on a couple of stories of, well, let's just say one type of category.  But, um, they were all blown out last night by a crazy six-train guy.  Six-train guy rules.  Six-train guy.  So, I really didn't see many of the other stories that I usually look at.  What I don't understand is, every once in a while, one of my YouTube videos gets yanked.  Yeah, yeah.  I have about five or six that have been yanked over the last couple of years. 
[00:19:00]  And my videos, they get yanked, don't even come close to what you're seeing in this video.  It had everything.  You got a naked fucking guy.  It had language.  It had nudity.  Right.  It had, uh, uh, violence.  Um, it had everything.  I laughed, I cried, I felt good about myself.  It had all the features, and it's still on YouTube.  Because when I tweeted, we all tweeted yesterday.  Yeah.  When I tweeted, I'm like, watch this immediately.  Because YouTube's gonna, you know, they're gonna take it down.  They didn't take it down. 
[00:19:30]  And the guy that, uh, did this on his camera, phone, or whatever, what's he thinking?  Turning the fucking thing the wrong way?  I don't know.  Why are we getting sideways video?  I don't know.  And I've seen this on a lot of videos.  It's either completely sideways, or it's up and down, but, like, too thin.  It's in portrait mode.  Right.  Instead of landscape mode.  Right.  How the fuck do you do that?  I don't know.  I'm betting this guy wanted to discreetly record him, so he was just kind of holding the camera. 
[00:20:00]  Discreetly?  The guy's fucking in his underwear.  Oh, I know he's insane, but I'm saying that's probably why.  You get the camera right there these days.  No one cares.  That's an inexperienced guy.  Right.  Because when I was filming the black guy with the chain, everyone's like, I can't believe  how close you got.  Get right up there.  And you just nailed it.  They don't notice you're filming.  They don't notice.  This guy's not going to notice you're filming.  He's pulling his pants down.  They don't notice.  They never notice.  I was thinking also, this is something else that hit me watching this video yesterday.  Anyway, the fact that if you took this video and went into the past with it, until like 
[00:20:30]  the 70s, let's say, and said, this is a video from 2011.  They'd be, oh, the future.  Wow.  And then try to let them interpret what's happening.  At the end, when he's on the ground and everybody's holding up their camera phones, did you see  how many people, they'd be like, I guess the public in the future are given like these 
[00:21:00]  knockout ray guns to subdue him.  And they're all pointing it at him.  And so the police have assistance.  Like it could, no one would think that we all carry around recording devices to record  every image that happens.  Everything.  They would never think that.  They would think they're hitting him with a subdue ray that takes him down.  I think in another five years, all this is not going to matter. 
[00:21:30]  Really?  Because at that point, we've seen everything.  We have seen everything.  Oh, there's another video of a naked guy on a subway.  You know what I mean?  You're going to be desensitized after a while.  I've been very desensitized.  Right now, we're in the know.  Like we're all looking around to see if we can film some shit.  Yeah, what's the new fucking cool thing.  But I think in a few years when you've seen so much of this, you're going to be like,  yeah, it's just life.  You know what I could watch?  Now we know that all that shit is going on out there.  I was never able to watch that I could watch now is a lot of death. 
[00:22:00]  Not beheadings I can't watch.  Why is Jimmy influencing you?  It's not so much Jimmy.  It starts off me watching very high altitude bombing runs in Afghanistan, right?  Oh, yeah.  I could watch the war shit.  Yeah, but then it says also includes graphic aftermath photo montage.  And I'm like, all right, let me stick it out.  So then you see the guys in there, their heads are busted open.  They got them wacky eyes that are dead.  Maybe a limb is blown off. 
[00:22:30]  And then you'll see like a bombing in progress.  Like it's slowly over the years, I was brought up to speed where I could sit there now and  watch people get shot and shit like that.  I can't watch people cut in half and writhing around on the ground still alive.  No.  But the dead people that are already dead or the high altitude infrared shots of people  getting blown apart, that doesn't bother me.  And it used to, I would never watch that.  Yeah, I think we have gotten used to that. 
[00:23:00]  We're getting desensitized.  Absolutely.  But the beheading, that's where.  No, no.  I just can't fucking do that shit.  I can't watch people really dying in horrible ways up close.  I could watch a little distance.  I don't mind a good shooting, maybe a good grenade through a window or something like  that.  But you start realizing like, hey, I'm kind of watching some sick shit these days.  That 10, 15 years ago you wouldn't be watching?  No, and it's not really bugging me.  Like, I could sleep just dandy after watching it.  So it's an odd thing that's happening. 
[00:23:30]  No, I thought you were going to go further with it.  That, yeah.  No, there's still some things I can't watch.  But now, will that change over time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, what's going to change?  It's still disturbing.  What's going to change over time?  We're just going to be, you know, remember the Situation Room with Obama and all that?  Yeah.  We're going to be.  Real time.  Yeah, we're going to be watching this shit.  That would be kind of good.  Well, we were.  When you think about Egypt and stuff, we were watching real time.  More or less. 
[00:24:00]  Writers being put down at some point.  More or less.  Yeah.  But I mean, what we saw with the Egypt thing is people were uploading videos.  Yeah.  So you were watching stuff maybe a couple hours after it happened.  And even on the news, you were watching live shots.  But I think it moves forward to the point where they're not going to be able to stop it.  And you'll just be watching this stuff in real time.  You know, when CNN has a camera on the square in Egypt, yeah, you're kind of watching it.  Yeah.  But I'm talking like everyone.  Right in there.  Right in there.  Real time.  Pretty much podcasting it.  Like Skyping or fucking FaceTiming. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Like real time shit.  Because still, I mean, the FaceTime and podcasting on the phone, it needs another year.  Yeah.  Right?  Another year or two.  It needs a little more.  FaceTime is great.  Yeah, it is good.  But I mean, as far as like, you know, broadcasting yourself in a car or something as you're driving  to work or whatever, it's another year or two.  We're pretty close.  We're getting close, though.  We're pretty close.  Naked crazy guy on the 6 train, and I tweeted it, the screams of both horror and laughter 
[00:25:00]  and stuff sounded like when the towers came down.  Like all the people in the street when they went, ah!  Yeah.  That happened when the guy just pulled his boxes down and got naked.  That's how fucked up as a country we are.  Like everyone...  Would you be laughing?  I do.  I know you're answering.  Laughing my balls off guy.  Of course.  The guy reminded me of Tippy Tom a little bit. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  Because he was just crazy and naked.  Someone said Eastside Dave.  Eastside Dave and other ones.  Who's putting out some ridiculously funny videos, by the way.  Who would be screaming guy?  I don't know.  Not screaming girl.  No offense to the women out there, but I think they would scream before a male in that  situation.  I think guys are screaming like, oh shit!  Oh my God!  Like out of shock, but not out of like terror.  No.  Some girls are screaming out of terror.  Why?  They thought they might get a penis helmet on their forehead or something? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Well, the guy did run up to some woman and knock that shit out of her hands when she was  trying to walk up the stairs.  I don't understand what the cop was doing.  He really let that shit get a little out of hand.  I think he was waiting for backup.  Can we watch this shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The sounds are great.  When he just starts yelling nigger and Jew, this guy was all over the place.  Naked, racist guy.  It's a viral video, but you have to turn your head completely to the left. 
[00:26:30]  Sideways.  Some people have fixed it.  Can we tilt the monitor?  They corrected it.  Some people corrected the video.  Well, that's smart.  So there's like LiveLeak, I think.  So this is what?  The six train?  Yeah.  Six train, subway.  LiveLeak has it in the corrected format.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Somebody took it and tilted it the right way.  Ah, crazy subway maniac.  Love that guy. 
[00:27:00]  Let's see.  It's got to be like somewhere very, very close.  You'd think they would just keep it up on their front page.  You'd think like that.  What's wrong with these people?  What's bigger than that right now?  What's more important than that?  Give it its own spot.  Naked Subway.  It's like I've got to find.  Where is he?  Come on.  I just watched it.  Come on.  Yeah, maybe it was a copyright thing, though.  Maybe.  You think?  I don't know.  A copyright thing.  Because it would have been right there.  And what happens to everybody else's video that you see?  Because they're all videoing this. 
[00:27:30]  Like, so what happens to everyone else's?  Where is it?  I don't know.  They haven't uploaded it?  Some people are just.  Yeah, they film shit and then go, who?  You know, they just show their friends.  There were at least 20 people I saw in there with their phones out.  There should be 20 angles of this thing.  Yeah.  It's a biggie.  All right, we can go sideways.  It's fine.  Yeah.  I just want to.  So we slowly take those clothes off. 
[00:28:00]  We need to.  We need to.  Oh, man.  You get the fuck off the street.  You get the fuck off the street.  Huh?  Shoot me.  Shoot me, nigga.  Shoot me.  Huh?  Wow.  Guys laughing.  Oh, wow.  Fuck you.  Josh.  Josh.  Josh.  Josh.  Josh. 
[00:28:30]  Josh.  Josh.  I'm insane, right?  I'm insane.  He's in his boxers.  Now he's yelling at the Jews.  You can tell when he takes the boxers off just from the sound of the crowd.  That's the towers coming down.  You're right.  He's screaming. 
[00:29:00]  Now he's completely naked.  Where's the cop?  The cop's up right there.  Now he's just running around the platform.  His big hairy fucking bursts.  Yeah, with a tiny schmeckle.  Running up the stairs.  Grabbed something out of a lady's hand and slammed it down on the ground.  That was just sort of attacking people.  And now he's very close to the edge of the platform. 
[00:29:30]  And now the cop is trying to apprehend him.  And some of the bystanders are helping.  He's wily.  Very hard to subdue a naked man.  He's fighting.  Some citizens getting him out and helping the officer subdue. 
[00:30:00]  Look at all the phones are out.  Everyone just taking pictures of this guy's bugging.  Oh, yeah?  What happened?  Yeah, they kind of got him cuffed.  But the cop really stood. 
[00:30:30]  I've noticed black guys and Hispanic guys, whenever they video something from their phone,  at some point they have to turn the phone to their face and say something like,  this shit be crazy, and then go back to the action.  They like getting their own credit.  It's kind of entertaining.  Man, this happened at the Chuck E. Cheese.  And then back to action.  No, it's the best part.  I'm going to put this shit on the YouTube.  And then back to the action.  You know, right on their face. 
[00:31:00]  He'd be bugging.  He'd be bugging.  That nigga be cray-cray.  Wham, right back.  He'd be bugging.  Is that old school?  He'd be bugging his old school, yeah.  I don't think they'd do that.  I don't know if that guy was bugging.  What I want to know, so he's yelling the N-word like crazy?  Yeah.  And that's a...  The cop was a black guy.  But the rest of the train, that's like a black train in that area.  They don't care, because that guy was crazy enough.  He was so crazy that they...  Right.  It's laughable at that point, right?  It negates the N-word. 
[00:31:30]  From a white guy.  From a white guy when you're that crazy.  Wow.  Because then they're just laughing at it, like one of their buddies said it.  Right.  See?  So if you act crazy, you could say it.  You could say it.  But you've got to act that crazy.  That's the line of crazy you've got to be, when you could just blurt that out on the  sixth train.  And there's no consequences.  And no repercussions for that.  Of course, he got arrested for being naked with his schmeckle out.  Yeah.  His little schmeckle.  Yeah.  But if he was just a businessman, right?  And the door opened, and there's a black cop standing there, and he just started yelling 
[00:32:00]  that out the door at the cop.  People in the train would be going, hey, hey, motherfucker, what are you saying?  What are you saying?  And there could be a problem.  What are you saying?  What are you saying?  But when he's taking his underwear off and showing his big hairy cock, he could yell  whatever he wants.  You've got to trim that shit down a little.  Racial epithets mean nothing with your dick hanging out on a subway.  Is the bird nest still in?  The bird nest.  Is that still in?  With the two eggs and the mama bird or the baby. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, that's a baby bird.  Waiting to be fed.  Yeah.  Hard to get a rod while you're yelling nigger and Jew while you're naked on a train.  I think at the very least, you've got to trim your fucking bird's nest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if he left his house in the morning thinking that was going to be his day, though.  True.  So, you know, to shave.  It's like, I'm just going to lose my shit.  I'm going batshit on the sixth train.  Let me trim down just in case I take my boxes off and run naked yelling racial epithets at 
[00:33:00]  police officers.  What I'm learning, you know, because I do some street videos, whatever, nothing like this,  obviously, but people from the rest of the country are shocked.  Oh, yeah.  That this shit happens in New York City.  Yeah, New York.  They really are shocked.  I just assume that this kind of crap happens in every city, certainly, in every town.  You've got this weird shit going on.  But I'm learning more and more that, no, man, this is just a very unique place.  You know what it is?  And everybody that was watching this, after that guy was cuffed, all got on their trains, 
[00:33:30]  went to work, did whatever they had to do, anywhere else in the country, maybe L.A.  or something like that, but anywhere else, like the Midwest and stuff, those people would  have had to have gone home, shaken, and been like, oh my God, I can't believe what I saw  today.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, would you?  Like, freak out.  But we just, ah, back to work.  I'm only learning that recently.  I really am.  It's crazy.  I thought that this is just, ah, you know.  It's our melting pot. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  I mean, that video I made with the black guy with the chain, really thick chain, and he's  yelling the end line.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Osama Bin Laden.  Osama Bin Laden.  If you look at that video, fuck the action.  Look at the people.  That's what I study.  And they're going by this insane scene that's going on, and they're just on their phones.  Another guy, I think, is ordering a pretzel.  Doesn't matter.  Guy's walking out of Starbucks with coffee, and this shit is going on right in front of  him, and no one's stopping to watch.  It's just a... 
[00:34:30]  It's like, oh, another crazy person in the streets of New York.  There's so many people.  It's such an urban environment.  It's, you know, a lot of people working, a lot of homeless people all mixed together.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  We don't have it separated where there's a, you know, this nice area, and then you've  got to go way the fuck away to get to a bad area and stuff.  Right.  It's all, like, intermingled.  So we kind of learn to just live with each other and look and go, oh, well, that's happening.  Yeah.  Great.  There's a guy with his pants off and his hairy dick, and he's yelling nigger out the fucking 
[00:35:00]  subway door.  All right.  I'm just going to go grab a pretzel and...  You know, I should have watched that video closer.  Were there people on the subway just not even paying attention?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just looking at their phones and stuff?  Yeah, just people, like...  Like...  And that woman walking up the stairs was just trying to get somewhere.  Right.  Guy ran up.  She didn't even give a shit.  Right.  Guy's naked.  She wasn't running away.  No.  She was just walking, and the guy slapped, like, some kind of merchandise out of her hand. 
[00:35:30]  That is so fucking weird, man.  It's an odd situation.  I'd like to actually speak to Kenny, who just walked in about this.  Kenny, did you see the video?  No, sir.  I'm behind in the times.  Oh, Kenny.  This is a viral video that is everywhere today.  This is something...  At least show the beginning again, so Kenny could get a little thinker, because you used  to be a law enforcement officer.  I just want your take on how the cop handled this. 
[00:36:00]  I think he was a little overcautious, because some civilians seem to have been in some danger  from this guy.  He was able to get close enough.  He's yelling at the N-word.  You give the fuck up.  Shoot me.  Shoot me, nigga.  Shoot me.  That's a car.  The officer was an African-American gentleman.  Fuck you.  See, now the officer's standing outside the train. 
[00:36:30]  He's in the train.  Now, the pants are around his ankles.  Wouldn't you think that's a good time to take him down?  But the cop lets him take his pants off completely.  Now his legs are all freed up.  Now he's yelling, Jews, Jews.  Punching the subway.  Fucking Jews. 
[00:37:00]  And then he...  And then off come his boxers.  The crowd just going in hysterics now.  And he leaves the train.  Now the officer's right outside the door of the train.  He lets him walk out  and start getting into the crowd now.  And if you watch,  a woman's walking up the stairs  and is accosted by this gentleman.  And the officer's still standing there.  What is he doing?  He should have grabbed him  as soon as he left the subway, right? 
[00:37:30]  Now...  And then he's subdued by the officer  on the side of the platform  with the help of many citizens.  And that's pretty much it.  Now, Kenny,  your professional assessment of that situation,  what happened there?  The cop's in a no-win situation.  Really?  Yeah, because you're damned if you do,  you're damned if you don't.  You make that up?  And there's too many witnesses around  to do what you really need to do.  Now, what did he need to do to that guy? 
[00:38:00]  Well, he...  When you first see the clip,  he's calling for backup.  Right, obviously.  All right?  And the guy's, you know,  what they call an EDP,  emotionally disturbed person.  Apparently so, yes, yes.  Plus, he's probably a dirty,  filthy, stinking homeless guy.  All right, and he's naked.  Yeah, yeah.  So the guy doesn't want to wrestle around  with him alone.  Yeah, so he's waiting,  because, you know, 
[00:38:30]  if this was like the movies,  like you just walk up to him,  you hit him with your Coco Bola  one shot over the head,  and that's it.  Right.  You know, but like when he went  after that lady on the stairs...  Yeah.  ...that, you know,  he may be like,  you know,  who am I to say  to second-guess somebody?  Exactly, but I'm thinking,  especially when he went  after the lady on the stairs,  there were points beforehand  when his pants were around his ankles 
[00:39:00]  and he went to take that last one off,  I think the officer  probably could have charged in,  cross-body blocked him,  and just knocked him right on the floor  then with his pants around his ankles.  Uh, he let that opportunity get away.  Now the guy's completely naked  roaming around the platform.  Then when he's going up the stairs  to accost that woman,  you got the stairs as your assistant.  He could have hit him from behind  and face-planted him on the stairs.  Now, again, I'm not second-guessing either.  This guy's in this situation.  I'm just saying, 
[00:39:30]  I saw a couple of opportunities  where this guy didn't have to be  wandering around the platform  with his dick hanging out.  There's more than one way to skin a cat.  Is that what you're saying?  I mean, you're absolutely right.  When his pants were down there,  you could have maybe tackled him good.  But then now what?  Now you've got to roll around with this guy  because, believe me,  when people don't want to get locked up  and people don't want to get handcuffed  and the adrenaline's going,  it ain't easy sometimes.  And you don't want his dick rubbing on you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So, like, you know, 
[00:40:00]  all's well that ended well.  So you, now,  let's say an officer like you.  Not you yourself.  Well, not like me.  I was professional.  Right, right.  I'm saying like a Dirty Harry.  A Dirty Harry kind of guy, let's say.  Let's say he worked in Jersey or something.  I'm just picking a state.  What would have happened to this guy  before cameras were all over the place?  Before the cameras ruined police work.  I know.  Before the pesky cell phone.  Yes, the pesky citizen and his cell phone. 
[00:40:30]  What would have happened to this guy, Kenny?  Well, I saw on TV once.  Right, right.  It was in a fast food joint.  Yeah.  And a couple of walking cops  went in to take their meal break.  Uh-huh.  Right?  And there was a security guard in there.  And he, like, just told the cops  how he threw a kid out  for, like, spitting in the salad bar.  Oh, crap.  All right?  So the cops sit down with their meal.  All right?  And here comes this kid back in  because nobody's going to tell him what to do. 
[00:41:00]  And now he's showing off in front of a few females.  Oh, boy.  All right?  So the certain cop gets up from his meal.  Do we have a description of this perp?  Yeah, you know.  Jesus.  All right.  Yeah, you know.  What the hell?  Kenny.  What the hell, man?  So the cop, you know,  he gets one bite out of his burger,  you know,  and he goes over,  and they go, like,  look,  they asked you to go. 
[00:41:30]  Why don't you just go?  Sounds reasonable.  Nobody's telling me what to do.  So the cop's trying to, like,  do the right thing and be nice.  And look,  the cop goes,  look,  I asked you nicely to leave.  You don't want to leave.  Now I'm telling you,  you got to go.  Oh, boy.  I'm quoting this movie cop.  Right, right.  The cop from the movie.  So the guy's like,  nobody's telling me what to do.  He's showing off in front of the females.  So the cop grabs him  out of the chair,  throws him on the table,  and when the cop reaches back 
[00:42:00]  for his handcuff,  the guy spins around off the table  and punches him in the face.  Oh, shit.  So the next thing you know,  this cop and this perp  are rolling around  all over the floor  of this fast food joint.  This is a Bruckheimer movie?  Yeah,  it was some kind of action flick.  Sounds like a Bruckheimer action movie.  Yeah.  Now this cop,  he knows there's like  a lot of witnesses around  because there's other people  in the fast food joint  who weren't the same minority as him.  Yes.  And now he's wondering, 
[00:42:30]  there's three other cops.  Like,  what are they doing  when this cop's rolling  all over the floor  with this guy?  Crazy.  You know?  So then like,  I guess the cop got like tired  of just like wrestling around  with that guy  and he pulled out his slapper  and just like hit the guy  until the guy just like  didn't want to get hit no more  and gave up.  Right?  And then he looks up  and the other cop,  because the cop that was  wrestling around, 
[00:43:00]  you know,  you lose your handcuffs,  your flashlight,  your radio,  everything,  you lose everything.  Right.  You know,  when you're rolling around  and the cop looks up  and the one cop  is standing there  with his handcuffs  like hanging on his finger  like here,  like he was nice enough  to hand the other cop  the handcuffs he dropped.  That doesn't sound like  very good,  you know,  partnering.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then,  so the guy gets cuffed up,  the cop calls from backup  and all his friends come  from the other side of town 
[00:43:30]  to like help him now  and clear the joint out.  Right.  And that mutt gets charged  with like aggravated assault,  resisting arrest  and the whole thing.  But,  you know,  the game they play is  they,  they,  they countercharged the cop.  Oh,  yeah.  So now,  so now the cop gets  countercharged with the  aggravated assault,  possessional weapon  because he hit him  with a slapper,  you know,  and it's going to go  to grand jury,  you know,  and,  and,  and you got,  you know,  a PBA attorney,  you know,  whose nickname is like 
[00:44:00]  five to 10,  if you're lucky.  This sounds great.  I got to see this.  It sounds like a great movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this,  can you get on Netflix?  Is it streaming?  Yeah.  And,  you know,  the kid,  you know,  he,  he was a high school senior,  but he happened to be  19 years old.  You know,  you really know the details  of this flick.  Oh,  no,  I saw it a few times.  Oh,  yeah.  Well,  I would watch it a lot too.  It sounds very,  very action packed. 
[00:44:30]  You know,  you got to end up like  dropping the charges  and then it's like a wash.  Oh,  so it's a wash.  So the kid walks away  with nothing  and the cop walks away  with nothing  and they give that look  to each other  in the courtroom  like,  ah,  you son of a bitch.  Especially,  especially when you got  to worry about  like,  in some opinion,  maybe a racist cop  that said he would have  testified against the other cop  because he instigated  the whole thing.  How that could have happened, 
[00:45:00]  you know,  it was beyond me.  Yeah.  You know,  there was a lot of racial tension  back in the day.  Back in the day  and that's when this movie  took place.  Oh,  yeah,  another part of this movie.  I mean,  back in the day,  fights in the locker rooms.  Wow,  really?  Oh,  it got so bad.  Yeah,  it got so bad.  Like,  two radio cars  would pull up  at an intersection  on a red light  and guys would get out  and just start beating each other  at the fucking red light.  You know.  You gotta see this.  The good old days.  This movie has a lot 
[00:45:30]  of twists and turns.  Yeah,  it really does.  Cops used to keep  their cocaine  rolled up in their gun barrel.  You know,  that was back  before you had a study  for a piss test.  Who was the romantic lead  in this movie?  Hey,  yes,  was there a love story,  a love angle?  Yeah,  was there a love story?  That's great.  Was it interwoven?  It should be.  Yeah,  the love angle is,  you know,  like in a ghetto precinct.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  The Caucasian officers,  you know,  just because they're  in that environment,  you know,  there's some jungle fever.  Oh,  okay,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  So they ended up like  leaving their wives  and screwing up  their marriage.  Wow.  You know,  for a little brown sugar.  Sounds like,  almost like  Fort Apache,  the Bronx.  I saw that movie  years ago.  Yeah,  yeah.  Yeah,  hardcore.  Wow,  that's good.  A good,  two thumbs up  for this movie?  Oh,  yeah.  Every finger.  The middle finger. 
[00:46:30]  That's a hell of a movie.  Oh,  well,  Kenny's movie reviews again.  I love Kenny's movie reviews  when he talks about,  yeah.  It's been a while.  These old cop movies  that he's watched  over the years.  So,  you know,  this guy,  like he did a right  for himself.  Yeah.  Like he could have been  a tad more aggressive.  More aggressive.  He could have grabbed  as soon as he got  off the train.  Because it seems  like a few citizens  might not have to  have been subject  to that.  Right.  In other news, 
[00:47:00]  because I know  his phone is beeping.  Are we going to get  a very angry Jim Norton?  Oh,  boy.  Because I just read  one of his tweets.  Oh,  boy.  Well,  he's five minutes out.  Okay.  Because I guess  the plane pulled up.  You know,  he's coming back  from L.A.  like he does.  Yeah.  And,  you know,  it landed  and he was just  waiting for the  Newark people to,  you know.  Or get him  to the gate  or something?  He was at the gate.  Oh,  but waiting for  the door to open  and the jetway.  that G.  Oh,  God.  I love that one. 
[00:47:30]  That's so loud.  He had a bad  customer experience  last night,  too.  Really?  He's going to be  angry when he gets  in here.  Ladies and gentlemen,  we are at the gate,  but we need  somebody to come  and work the jetway  over to the door.  This will take  some time,  so sit tight  and we'll let you know  when that jetway  is on its way over.  Thank you.  Half hour later.  Wait,  wait,  you mean the guy  that fucking hits  that little joystick 
[00:48:00]  and rolls the fucking  hallway to the door?  I think that's it.  That motherfucker  isn't,  don't they know  that there's a plane  sitting there?  Where is that guy?  They should be there  the second the fucking  plane pulls up.  All right,  it says,  Jim Norton tweeted,  waiting to get off  the plane,  but none of the  asshole Newark employees  have moved the jetway yet.  Hate the fucking  airline industry.  And then he writes,  Joe Torre is right  behind me.  I'm panicking.  Oh, 
[00:48:30]  does he get a picture?  What do you think?  Does he get a picture?  Let's keep going here.  If Joe Torre is behind him,  he's got to get a picture.  And then he wrote,  Omar bin Laden has doubts  his father is dead.  Omar bin Laden should  kill himself,  then see if they bump  into each other  at Virgin Fest.  So I guess he's off  the plane if he's  tweeting that.  So Jimmy should be  here very soon.  Yeah,  he's five minutes out,  I guess he said.  all right,  well,  good for Jimmy.  It's a hell of a start.  My God,  I love those Kenny stories  from movies. 
[00:49:00]  I can't get enough.  You know,  from movies.  Old school movies.  Yeah,  he should write a book  about movies,  like Leonard Maltin.  You know Leonard Maltin  writes those movie books?  Kenny should write  a movie book about  all the movies  he's seen over the years.  You know,  you should hear  some of the movie stories.  Maybe change the names.  You should hear the ones  he doesn't talk about  on the air.  Oh,  I've heard a few.  I've heard a few movies  that he's seen.  Wow. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Yeah.  It's just that  old school shit  that is amazing.  That's long gone.  Yeah.  Anthony,  when we get back,  I think we're going  to do the  Annoying 30 Seconds  Contest,  finally.  We didn't do that  yesterday.  And we were supposed  to do it Friday.  The day before  and then Friday.  We were supposed  to do it Friday,  but we took Friday off.  Yeah.  And then we were  supposed to do it,  what day is today?  Wednesday.  We were supposed  to do it yesterday,  but we had so many guests  that we had to kind of  throw that to the side. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  And Monday,  the same shit happened.  So we're finally  going to announce  the winner of the  Most Annoying 30 Seconds  Contest after the break.  Oh.  We got third,  second,  and first place.  Oh.  So we got to do that  immediately right after  the break,  okay?  Yes.  And is the Patrice  thing worth replaying  today,  you think?  Yeah,  that was pretty cool.  Patrice getting his  blues on,  as they say.  We made a video.  It's in all the  familiar places.  If you want to check  out Patrice O'Neill  singing the blues  with Warren Haynes.  Off the cuff,  by the way.  Oh, 
[00:50:30]  yeah,  yeah.  Completely off the cuff.  We found the words  online and Patrice  went with it.  They both knew the song,  obviously,  and found the words  and Patrice sang along.  A Howling Wolf song,  right?  Yeah,  yeah.  You got it in there,  Travis?  Thumbs up?  Okay,  so we'll go to break  with this.  So we had Warren Haynes  in yesterday.  He's becoming a pretty  good friend of the show.  He's a good egg,  as they say.  That's great.  I was telling him  off the air,  like right after we  finished up,  I was like,  fucking 9.30 in the  morning,  and he's singing like that.  Yeah.  Like that,  I can't even grasp. 
[00:51:00]  You can't comprehend that?  No,  you gotta be like,  oh,  gravelly morning voice  and shit.  Right.  And he just sounds,  he's got a great voice.  Well,  that's probably why  he stopped partying.  He probably just had to  kind of keep his voice  together.  Maybe that's why I sound  like this in the morning.  I don't know.  Maybe it's fucking,  I have vocal cords  by Budweiser.  You don't have to sing  though in the morning,  so who cares?  I sing through comedy  and entertainment.  There you go.  That is my song.  I give to you, 
[00:51:30]  the people.  And my shitty voice  because of the allergies.  Fucking.  Worst allergy season ever,  some people are saying.  At least they admitted it  on the news today.  Yeah.  Worst allergy season ever  for the New York area.  I've been getting killed  with this thing  since last week.  It's almost a whole week  of allergies.  The top of my pool  looks like it's been slimed.  Really?  It's all just green shit?  It's got this green mist on it  and a lot of these  little flowery things.  I posted it, of course,  on Twitter under  white people problems.  Yeah, I like that.  That my pool  is full of things 
[00:52:00]  and I have to empty  the skimmer  probably two,  three times a day  by myself.  It's an outrage.  That's a white guy's problem.  It is white people problems.  I like your new Twitter bed.  It's nice.  It's just some  white people problems  that I notice pop up  every so often  that I have.  Pool heater  was running out of propane  and I called the propane people  and they said,  we can get it to you tomorrow.  I'm like,  I need it now. 
[00:52:30]  Yes.  Tomorrow's tomorrow.  Today's today.  Today's today.  I want to crank that bitch.  So we were goofing around  with Warren Haynes  and like you said,  he just goes with it  which is kind of neat.  How great was it  to hear him just playing riffs?  Dude, I wanted to just hear him  play fucking  Allman Brothers riffs  the whole time he was here.  Yeah.  Just go off on it.  Oh, yeah.  And I didn't realize  he's been in the band  that fucking long.  I know, right?  That's 21 years.  Something like that.  22 years.  That's probably longer  than other Allmans  have been in the band.  Fuck yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Dwayne Allman wasn't  in that band.  And he was in Allman.  And he was in Allman.  You're right.  Someone turned me on  to Simple Man.  He does a great version  of Simple Man.  Holy shit.  Song about E-Rock.  Oh, wait.  He's not even here.  Is he here?  I haven't noticed.  Where is he?  Oh, where is he, Rock?  Wait, he's not here this week?  No, Eric's on vacation.  Vacation?  Yep, that's right.  I thought he's been here  and doing his job.  I thought he was here, too.  Oh.  Huh.  Wow, pretty cool, huh? 
[00:53:30]  Is he in Florida?  Close to Florida.  Close to Florida?  He's in a place we've been.  Oh, oh, further south.  He went to Cuba.  Yes, he's in Cuba.  All right, he's in Cuba.  All right, we go to break with...  Fidel Fatstro.  All right, it's a reach,  but he's fat.  We go to break with Patrice O'Neal  and Warren Haynes getting together  for a little jam.  All right.  Patrice singing a Howling Wolf song  and, of course,  Warren Haynes just filling in it  nicely with some blues.  Check it out.  Hey, we got the lyrics.  Maybe these two... 
[00:54:00]  What's the name of the song?  Going Down Slow.  Going Down Slow.  Maybe you guys could just play us out.  That would be kind of cool.  I didn't realize Patrice had a voice.  And Patrice, big mama prods,  and he's doing...  And I'm at Marco Island this weekend.  This weekend.  Okay, very cool.  Captain Bryan.  Do you mind playing us out with that, Warren?  Sure.  If we got the lyrics?  I think I...  If I'm reading,  I think I definitely...  All right, this is a little weird.  It's going to be Patrice O'Neal,  Warren Haynes.  Man, this is all spoken.  Man, you know I've been enjoying things  that kings and queens will never have. 
[00:54:30]  In fact, kings and queens can never get...  And they don't even know about it.  In good times...  Great googly moogly.  Great googly moogly.  I have had my fun  If I never get well no more  I have had my fun 
[00:55:00]  If I never get well no more  Oh, my health is fading on me  Oh, yeah, I'm going down slow 
[00:55:30]  Now, look at here  I did not say I was a millionaire  But I said I've had spent more money  Than a millionaire  Because if I had kept all my money  That I already spent  I would have been a millionaire  A long time ago  And women  Ooh 
[00:56:00]  Women  Great googly moogly  Please write my mama  Shape I'm in  Please write my mama  Tell her the shape I'm in 
[00:56:30]  Tell her to pray for me  Forgive me for my sin  Hey, man  That's all right  Patrice, that's all right  That's holla moogly  You gotta listen to holla moogly though, man 
[00:57:00]  That's all right  You got a voice on you, Patrice  I'm going down slow  You just said tell my mama  I love him  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The Virus  The Opie and Anthony Show  Jimmy's back  Yes  Yes, I am  Back from his big Kentucky Derby 
[00:57:30]  Yes, in Los Angeles  Yeah  Los Angeles  How was the Kentucky Derby?  It was cool, man  It's like Mardi Gras  But it's so much tamer  And everybody's nice  It's like what you want Mardi Gras to be  Everybody's clean  And there's no fucking  And white  Violence  Yeah, a lot more white people  But even the black people  That are betting horses or not  It's not like Mardi Gras  Where it's a free-for-all  Everybody's just fucking  It's one big party, obviously  164,000 people there  I mean, it was a lot 
[00:58:00]  It was a fucking madhouse  And we had access to everybody  To all the jockeys  I said, to me, they're not a big deal  But I got to go into the jockey  Where a lot of you didn't see  Most of the footage  They didn't show  But I talked to all 19 of the guys  And I was in the jockey locker room  Which no one gets to go in  One of the cameramen came out  And goes, you guys have to know  How hard it is to get a camera crew back there  Wow  I didn't care  And my friend's a fucking horse trainer  And she was fucking  She's like, I would have cried if I met him 
[00:58:30]  I'm like, really?  Who is he?  You know, he's a fucking legend  I mean, I do with some of the older ones  I interviewed, too  Were the little guys  Walking around the locker room naked?  No  Giant cocks on them  I bet you they do have big jockey cocks  You think they have big  Fucking jockey cocks?  You know how much confident you have to be  To be so slight of frame  And controlling a horse?  Those horses are fucking wild, man  They have to  They probably use their cock  To balance them on the horse  That's what they whip the horse with  Yeah  Cock whip its mane 
[00:59:00]  Right  But people said that  Those horses are so fucking  Because I figured that they were trained well  But they're like  They constantly have to have  Their fucking head held  Because they just run  You see when they try to get them  In the gate  Sometimes they just  They gotta push those fucking things  They're wild  And the second they close that last gate  Bam!  They're off  If they leave them in there too long  Something's gonna happen  Those horses go bullshit  Yeah, they wanna run, man  And I got very close to one of them  I didn't pet it because  How close?  As close as a gentleman in Oregon 
[00:59:30]  Yes  Close enough to have my colon perforated  But it was fucking beautiful  This horse called Mucho Macho Man  Yeah, Mucho Macho Man  We know Mucho Macho Man  Yeah, it was a beautiful, beautiful horse  Mucho Macho Man was in the money, right?  Or at least  Top three, yeah  Top three?  Animal Kingdom won  And I don't remember what the other two  Right  Mucho Macho Man  One of the favorites  Nero, I think  Nero, yeah  Because I interviewed that guy too  And he fucking tickled my neck  Every one of them  I wish we could have a montage  Because I kept asking  What would it take for me to be a jockey 
[01:00:00]  Probably 12 of them said  You gotta lose a lot of weight  Oh, shit  Everyone was telling me  I was too fucking heavy  It was humiliating  I saw a show on jockeys once  And they go through  Because it's so competitive  To get a good horse  That they actually have eating disorders  And they vomit  What?  Hot box  You gotta get in the hot box  They say  Which is the steam room  They're like fighters  They have to be a certain weight  With their gear  How much do they weigh?  Yeah  110 to 117  With the gear?  No, I think 126 with the gear 
[01:00:30]  But they're like 110  Sometimes they'll handicap a horse  They'll add weight to the saddle  If the jockey is too light  And they want to handicap the horse  Because the horse is rated at  But I've seen where they actually do  Vomit  They puke  The hot box  Yeah, it's like any other thing  Where you gotta make weight  They get up on the scale  Hold them to like the saddle and shit  And everything  Get up on the scales  And make sure they're at the proper weight  They're all little fellas  Do they blow off their underwear and stuff 
[01:01:00]  If they have to like drop a few ounces?  Take a big midget dump  Take their socks off  What do they do?  I'm sure there's some tricks  One guy had like a little dwarfism going  But most of them are just regular small dudes  They're not midgets  Little guys  Yeah  And they're all fucking ripped  Every one of them is muscled  Solid muscle  But I think if you're under five foot  You're considered a midget though  Some of them were five feet  Five feet one  They were just tiny guys  Yeah  But you know  We all know what midgets and dwarves look like 
[01:01:30]  They didn't have that  They didn't have  They looked like people  Only small  They just looked like  They looked like  When they shrunk the kid  In fucking Willy Wonka  That's  Like it's just an adult  Mike TV  Yeah, Mike TV  Right, exactly  What birth  Mike!  What birth defect is that  That makes you a jockey?  I honestly don't know if it is one  Or if you're just small  I think it's some kind of  You don't see little people walking around like that  Issue with the pituitary gland  Yeah  I believe it's a pituitary problem  With the growth hormone  You think there are jockey families 
[01:02:00]  That just cut that piece out  So they can raise a jockey?  Yeah, it's like  Make him a jockey  Just fucking cut out his pituitary gland  When he's four  So he never grows any bigger  That's weird  Yeah, they were all such little guys  And what about the hats?  Everyone had the  Do you know who Pat Day is?  Who?  Pat Day  Oh, yeah, he's  Isn't he  Chris McKellen or McCarron  Do you know who those guys  They're like  Guys I talk to  I have no idea who they are  But apparently they're like  Two of the five best ever  They're jockeys, right?  Yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah 
[01:02:30]  Definitely  I don't know that world, man  Yeah, Day is big  And  Yeah, yeah  They're huge  Thank you, Kevin  He's won like 8,000 races  That fucking day  He's an older guy  He's retired  But it's like  It's almost like  Someone who didn't know  Who Jeter  And fucking  David Cone were  Oh, in that  Talking to them  And going  Oh, really?  They're big  I didn't even  That's what it's like  Because I talk to people  Who know racing  And they're like  Those guys are fucking  They're legends, right?  No idea  I used to bet  Like in the 
[01:03:00]  Late 80s and stuff  It was an OTB  Right next to where I worked  And I remember hearing  Those names back then  That and  Angel Cordero  Cordero's racing  And they would  They would parade  The horses around  Like right before  They went out to post time  They'd go around  This arena area  So you'd be able  To actually stand around it  And look  And see how your horse looks  Before you make that last bet  Yeah, but what are you looking for  As Joe Schmo?  I know  Joe Schmo  You're actually looking  What would you look for, Ant?  Be honest  I'd look to see 
[01:03:30]  If the horse was stepping real high  Like nice  And didn't look sluggish  His nostrils were wide  The fuck open  Because they give them  That goddamn drug  And make their nostrils  Open real fucking wide  What's that like  Afrin for horses?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It makes them breed  Like crazy  And their eyes look like  They're fucking petrified  They're just  You want a horse  That looks like  It's just gonna go bat shit  Did you know  That they tape their tongues?  I didn't know that  They fucking tongues  When they walk  Tape their tongues  Because we were in the paddock 
[01:04:00]  And I'm like  Why are they  They all look like  Blithering retards  Because I'm like  Why are their tongues hanging out?  And they're like  Oh, they tape them  They have to  They have to tape them down  To the bottom part of their mouth  So they don't choke on them  Or so they don't bite them off  While they're running  Wow  I never knew that  They treat the horse  The horse as the jockey  The horse and the jockey  The jockey's penis  Gets taped to his leg  Because it doesn't sit on it  Yeah, so the girthier jockeys  They would have  So the paddock area  You'd be able to look at  Them parading around and shit  And look  And there was this  Angel Cordero  Who was this little 
[01:04:30]  Tiny Mexican gentleman  Very successful jockey  Oh, sure  I know the name  And the things people  Would yell out at him though  I got money on you  You little fucking monkey  You little fucking monkey  I got money on you  You bitch  You fucked me last race  You monkey  They would call him a monkey  It sounds like our  Fucked up  Sounds like our listeners  And he does look a little  Like a monkey  But yeah  He was like huge  Yeah  Angel Cordero 
[01:05:00]  I remember him  I remember  Willie Shoemaker  Going way back  The shoe  Willie the shoe  I bet on the shoe  He was on  Wild World of Sports  That's why I know him  Yeah  Willie the shoe  And who was the jockey  Stevie Cawthon  Thank you  That's what I was going for  The young jockey  He was supposed to be  Like a huge success  But then he went to  England I think  Right?  Yeah, yeah  And did a lot of his racing  Over there  Did he win the triple crown  Or did he win  Like a couple of legs  Of the triple crown 
[01:05:30]  The last horse to do  Was I think  Secretariat  Right?  In like 73?  No, Secretariat  After that  They've had triple crown winners  As horses or just jockeys?  Oh, you mean like  The jockey riding the same horse  For all three races?  I don't know  I just  I'm not sure either  I don't know  There was one guy  The guy that won  Velasquez  Who won  He was supposed to ride  Fucking Uncle Mo  Huh?  But Uncle Mo got scratched  Because of his stomach  Or intestinal problems  And they literally  Just threw him  On that fucking horse 
[01:06:00]  So I guess there was  A problem with the jockey  On that horse  Where they didn't like him  Affirmed  Yeah, affirmed  You know one of the jockeys  Died, right?  1978  No  Yeah, one of the guys  You interviewed  No  TJ in Albany  I swear to God  I'm not fucking with you  I think it happened overnight  It's one of the  One of the news stories today  TJ in Albany  You got something on this?  What?  Yeah, I just heard that  He's right  Yeah, go ahead, sir  The jockey  That finished second  They found him dead  In his car  At four o'clock  In the afternoon  After the race  The next morning

[01:08:00]  Did not ride  In the derby  No, he didn't  Nero was written by  He rode Nero in February  The guy Corey Nakatani  Rode fucking Nero  That was the guy  Who was cocky  And who tickled my chin  Implying I had a fat neck  Oh, there's actually a little  This is the guy  Who  Who rode Nero  In the fucking  In the race  That little  That little fucking  Muscular guy  Oh, Jesus  Look at his arm  Dude, they're fucking  He's ripped  These guys are all  He's got bigger arms  Than you, Jimmy  All of them are solid muscle  Of all the jockeys

[01:15:00]  Oh shit  The fucking  I want to say  Brady was a dick  He wasn't nice  Everyone I know  Who spoke to him  Said the guy  Was an absolute jerk  But I'll say this  I did kind of  Interrupt him  While he was talking  Again I was  Fucking  Oh boy  I was fucking  Sheepish  Like  And he did  He didn't want to  You could tell by the picture  He wants nothing  To do with this  Really  Can we see the picture  Yeah  I gotta see it now  But then I  I was like  And Tom  Can I  But this is  Someone in his  Entourage  And I was like  I'm like  Could you sign  Maybe 
[01:15:30]  Because I  Thought he was  Going to say no  Because his friends  Are going  No more pictures  No more pictures  And who are those guys  One of them  Was his jerk off  Manager or agent  And then a couple  Of his fucking  Jerk off  We're friends  With Tom Brady  Friends  Oh god  And you were in a  VIP area right  Uh yes  More or less  Yes  But I  I will say  That the guy  I didn't like Tom Brady  I didn't think  He's a nice guy  But again  He did sign the football  He did take  It's like  He could have been  A lot worse  And it's gotta be  I kept trying to say 
[01:16:00]  Don't Twitter  And bash the guy  Because he fucking  Did it  And maybe he was annoyed  He's talking to people  He's trying to have a moment  And you interrupt  Alright fine  I'm annoying  But his friends  His fucking friends  Were so  They think they have  The ability to  Motherfuck you  Because they're friends  With this guy  It's like  Hey cocksucker  Yeah  You're with the talented guy  You're not the talented guy  Yeah  You're not  Don't try to fucking  Protect him  Like you're some fucking  Here's what you are  You're fucking 
[01:16:30]  Leech entourage  Thinking they may have been  Players  I don't even know  They could have been  A fucking wide receiver  At a tight end  Were they big guys  Yeah  A couple of them were huge  They might have known him  From college or whatever  And the one guy  Who was his manager agent  Was a fucking  Little twerpy douche bag  Still a lot bigger than me  And probably could have  Kipped the shit out of me  But I hated those fucking guys  Hated them  And I saw them  On the elevator  The next night  And they were just  Fucking twat  Tom was not  I can't say he was a twat  He just wasn't  A particularly nice guy  He's like  But again 
[01:17:00]  He's quarterback  That fucking shitty  Lead singer mentality  Right  But I can't kill him  And say he sucked  Because he did take the picture  Well Brad T in Kentucky  I ran into Tom Brady  At the Derby four years ago  And he was the biggest  Dickhead ever  Fuck him  I've heard over the years  That he's not a nice guy  Everyone I've met  Thought that the guy  That he was a twat  And these are people  Who fucking  And the people  I'm not going to say  The people I was with  Meet everybody  Everybody they meet  And they were all saying  That the guy  He was just not  But look at  But he did kind of  The picture  He was actually 
[01:17:30]  Friendlier in the picture  Than I thought  Like he did give me  The dumb half a smile  It's like he wasn't  That bad  He didn't frown  He tried to make  A half a smile  And he was annoyed  Yeah he's kind of like  Take a picture  Yeah  It wasn't the fucking  The worst  So I'm like  I can't fucking  Just throw him  Under the bus now  Yeah  That's a hurry up  And take the picture  Yeah yeah yeah  But again  I did interrupt him  So I was kind of  Annoying  I still got a picture  With Tom Brady  And I got him  To sign the ball  I had to ask  Why is the ball here  Because I traveled 
[01:18:00]  With it from  LA  This ball's been  All over the place  Who had to  Who had to watch  Your ball  As you were doing  That  Is he  Fucking is he  This dude who works  For Jay  He's the guy  One of our  Coordinators  He's fucking  The guy would literally  Walk through  Bin Laden's cave  Asking if we could  Fucking take shots  He is no fucking  He doesn't care  Where we are  He just looks like  He belongs  And he battles  Yeah he's one of  Those guys  That can get you  Anywhere with a camera  That's how he  He barrels through  But anyway  Izzy was in charge 
[01:18:30]  Of guarding my football  And all the celebrities  Were fucking  Wayne Brady was fucking  The comedians are always  Fucking nice  Yeah  You know what I mean  And I'm not saying  That because I'm a comic  But those guys  He was great  And friendly  And they were all okay  But the athletes  I just don't like  Athletes man  Except the MMA guys  It's that same  Fucking bullshit  All of them  Are fucked  But then again  I talked to some guy  From the Broncos  A black dude  Who was a fucking  Really nice guy  Like so  It's like  Now I'm kind of  Shooting my own  Dumb theory  Well you could always say 
[01:19:00]  For the most part  For the most part  Athletes are douchebags  You've had bad experiences  Yeah you know  And even Jenny from the block  Was nice to me  When I saw her  Oh wow  She didn't remember me  Of course  Oh she didn't remember you  No  We were on Leno together  Well we were  When she was with  American Idol  Yeah  But then we got  Introduced again  And she was very nice  And on the way out  I asked for a photo  And she was like  Sure baby  She was so sweet  But this is why  I will eventually  Take my own life  Because literally  If you see us 
[01:19:30]  Standing there  Look at what a  Fucking  Just look at  What a fucking  This is in the hallway  How fucking beautiful  She is  And what a  Fucking mope  I am  That was me  I was standing there  Waiting for her  She was walking by  I grabbed her  That's her turning around  In mid stride  I had fucking  Ten minutes to get ready  She just like  She's glowing  She's fucking  Floating down the aisle  Stop  Lovely  And I'm standing there  And I just  Whatever can go wrong  With my fucking  Disgusting body

[01:23:30]  But I'm like  Nah you already got a shot  With him  You don't need another one  So I'm walking  We're all walking  Off the plane  And we're walking  Down the fucking thing  Towards baggage claim  And I'm like  I know  I'm just gonna go  Joe  Thanks for all the great years  In New York  Oh no  I said  Oh no  I said  What else could I say to him  He really did  As a Yankee fan  He fucking gave me  A tremendous amount  Of joy  Oh yes  He really did  Joe Torre  Gave me a lot of fucking happiness  One of the greatest  Yankee skippers ever  Honestly was  You want to guess 
[01:24:00]  How this ends  Not great  Not the way  Jimmy wanted  Not the way  Jimmy had it  In his head  Not as badly  As it could have  Here's what I thought  What happened  I would go  Joe  Thanks for all the great years  And he would go  Oh you're welcome  Or thank you  And then we'd shake hands  And I'd keep going  Right  And perhaps the guy  He was with  The young guy  Might recognize me  Because he looked at me  A couple times  And I'm like  It was his nephew  Might have recognized me  Yeah  So we're walking  And there's a fucking  Fat pig woman  And I don't know  Where she is now

[01:53:00]  Like  Like we're calling  The fucking boss  Right  Is this why you called me?  Like it's like  If  If  Elo at the time  Was our boss  And we called him  During vacation  Which we  Probably would  And he would've  Gave us more than that  And he would've given us radio  But he would say things like  Guys  Is that it?  Is this why you called me?  Not E-Rock  He should be like  Oh thanks for calling guys  Gee I still have a job  I went on vacation  You  You know 
[01:53:30]  Actually realized I was away  We ought to ask him to leave the pool area  Em was snorting chicken fingers off a mirror  None of the other customers want to go in the pool with him  Em off the border of sides to get in the pool  When he jump in the pool  The children play a tsunami  I'll do what?

[01:57:00]  We wouldn't be implying that he was actually a whale  Alright thank you  Let's go to Nick in Atlanta  Nick  Nick there  What do you got buddy?  Nicky  Hey boys  I just want to counteract what that last jackass said  Yeah  A-Rock's got the best job in the world  And if he can't play a little on a fucking phone  While he's on vacation in Jamaica  He should try to do one of our shitty jobs out here in the real world 
[01:57:30]  I know you guys appreciate what you got  But that fucker  That's almost to me like somebody that  Won't come in on a weekend for an emergency  For a little company's business  I mean like  He's not a new player  He's not a new player  I'm gonna fight  Alright man  Turn on Fox News  Jamaica just capsized  Hey uh  Oh good  Peter's calling back  I don't know what happened  Peter you're the winner of the most annoying 30 second contest

I feel like Doc  He's gonna say Doc Brown  Of course he was  That's true  Something else  Ugh  Ugh  Why won't he fucking play along?  Because he's a blithering idiot  What is he doing?  Maybe he's mad because he's gotta wait for the jet boat  So we can go parasailing  Yes 
[01:58:30]  He wanted to go parasailing  They had to bring a barge in  The boat went up in the air and did a wheelie  When it tried to pull him  And the people fell off backwards  And drowned  He gets on his jet ski  All you see is his head through the water  He got water in the engine  Ah shit

[02:00:00]  Then you know we're not diets  I like the ice cream bowl thing  Oh boy the phone went dead again  Alright well  Oh come on  Why is he doing this?  Do you know how many treats he must be enjoying?  We should ask him if he's enjoying treats  How many treats have you having?  Does he ever look up and catch his wife looking at him like with hate? 
[02:00:30]  As he fucking has his face buried in a dessert bowl?  And he's eating another chocolate lava cake?  I'm eating more lava!  It's like I couldn't think of a volcano reference  So I'll just go eem fat  He's eating all these delicious treats  Every time he orders a dessert  She wants to fucking brain him with a hammer claw  If anyone's seen Alex Kittner  Please let us know  He disappeared after Iraq went in the water 
[02:01:00]  A water  Does this sound Italian?  What are you doing?  Hey the man break winded a license plate  Falled by the pool  Maybe  I think he might be hiding from the locals  Matt in Atlanta  You got something on that?  Hey you know that hotel  Probably feeding that fat stuff  To get him ready for the luau  Gonna shove an apple in his mouth  Fuck  I don't know what's wrong with that kid 
[02:01:30]  I don't know  Hey we had Larry King on Jimmy  Another thing we've been teasing for a couple days  Sam got to talk to Larry King after our interview  In the hallway  Because we weren't able to ask about the skateboarding thing  Yeah  I want the original clip  Remember that skateboarder?  What was it?  Just like an oversized fucking half pipe  Remember?  Uh huh  And he ended up what?  About 60 feet in the air  Oh it was crazy  And then he smashed down 
[02:02:00]  Yeah  He smashed down and broke everything basically  Yeah  And Larry King was talking to that guy  And he asked the kid  How important is the board?  As far as skateboarding goes  How important is the board?  Another clip we've played a lot on this show  Yep  And dissected  Well Sam  Because we ran out of time with Larry King  He was able to  How long did you have him for?  45 minutes  Oh that's cool  Yeah we had him for a while  Sam was able to ask him about that question  And this is what Larry King had to say  We're here with Larry King 
[02:02:30]  Larry you just wrapped up  Oh yeah you gotta get a picture with Danny  I'll take a picture with Danny  That's right I just wrapped up with Opie and Anthony  Do you want to comment?  Well yeah what was your experience?  One of the moments of my career  You think so?  54 years in broadcasting  And I'd have to say  You can tell how low I'm getting  At Opie and Anthony  Is a highlight  Well you said  That you were  After the interview you mentioned  Hearing fuck off  On a radio commercial  Was something  That's not my  That's so new to me  It's kind of weird  That's  I have never heard those words 
[02:03:00]  Come out of a radio  There's one more clip  That those guys play  That you did  You were talking to a skateboarder  Once on your show  On your show  And you asked him  How important is the board?  They've played you asking  How important is the board?  More than almost any clip  They've played  You don't understand that?  I mean I do  But for them  You ask the jockey  Who wins the race?  You or the horse?  Okay  Okay  Right?  How important  In a baseball player's life  Is the bat?  How does he choose his bats?  Does he have his bats  Specially made for him? 
[02:03:30]  Or does he buy stock bats?  Right?  Gloves  My kid is 12 years old  He's ordering a handmade glove  For him  As a baseball infielder  How important is the glove?  To the skateboarder  How important is the  I meant by that  Idiot  You can buy a $12 board  Or a $100 board  Is it the person  Or the board  That makes you good?  Great question  You make fun of that question?  I don't  They do  There see  That Opie and Anthony  They don't know what they're doing  They made fun of the groceries 
[02:04:00]  That was a great question  They make fun of the board  That's a great question  They should have asked me about it  I can explain it to them  It requires  However it requires intelligence  Thanks a lot Larry  You're welcome guys  Thanks so much  In other words  Of course  I mean  Two things participate  Yeah  Let's take  I'll give you an example  If you want to help yourself  Yeah  Let's take  You take a great skateboarder  The best in the world  And go into a store  And buy him  A $20 skateboard  And take an average skateboarder  Good but average 
[02:04:30]  And give him the best board in the world  Who would you bet on?  I would  Ah ha  Thanks a lot  See we got Larry thinking about it though  But the way he asks the question  How important is the board  Leads you to believe  That Larry's a dolt  Can you skate better with a board or with no board?  Yeah  That's what it sounds like  Yeah of course  How important is the board?  Of course  Well it's very important  It's like asking a ball player  How important is the bat? 
[02:05:00]  Do you go to the plate?  With one or without one  Right  He should have said  How important is the quality of the board?  Right  How important is the quality of the bat?  Okay  What are the differences in boards  In between a $20 board and a $300 board?  And how does it affect your skateboarding?  Not how important is the board?  Because asked like that  You would say very important  You would think the guy's losing his mind  As opposed to no board  Yeah you got to explain your question Larry 
[02:05:30]  Sure  I think Larry's had it with us  I think we shan't see him again  Hey we're going to play Guess the Sound  Really out of nowhere?  This is strange  Wow  Just a quick Guess the Sound  Why?  Why?  It's fun to play games  Interesting  But you ran in here with this  Guess the Sound  It's very topical  Out of nowhere we're playing Guess the Sound?  It's very topical Guess the Sound  So we have to guess what this is?  Yeah  Alright  Hear it again? 
[02:06:00]  What are you doing?  What do you guys think it is?  I think it's Roland on the phone with E-Rock  Close  E-Rock coming up for a fish?  Using that sonar in his head  What?  You want to know what the answer is?  Yes  You ready?  You didn't make a guess Opie  I don't know 
[02:06:30]  Obviously it has something to do with E-Rock  E-Rock  E-Rock giggling  Because he went to the spa  To have his barnacles scraped  What the fuck?  That would be  Roland losing his shit in the office  While you were making fun of E-Rock  Oh wow  Really?  Yeah  He's just  He's loving this right?  Can we get Roland in here before break?  He is loving this  Fucking Roland is losing his mind 
[02:07:00]  He loves when E-Rock gets blasted  Does he?  Oh yeah  Why does he hate E-Rock?  They hang out together  I just think it's a  He likes seeing him getting pounded  Eric in Philly  We should fucking order some desserts for E-Rock  So they have to bang on his door  A room service  Oh my god  Why don't we do that?  You know  Because we want him to enjoy his vacation  Yeah  He loves  I will tell you this  He loves treats  He loves being indulgent  Especially on vacation  Do you think he's eating poorly? 
[02:07:30]  Oh for sure  There's no way he's eating anything  But he's going to have a quandary  Like he's going to be woken up again  Because room service is going to be banging on his door  Yeah  He's going to open the door and go  What?  And then there's going to be all these delicious desserts on a tray  And then he's going to go  Who the fuck ordered this?  And then the guy has to say Opie and Anthony  And now what does he do?  He'll be happy  Because he loves desserts  He'll eat it  You want to bet?  We should have a bet  Yeah send him all kinds of cakes  Does he say I don't want the desserts  And slams the door?  No  What?  Or now he's got to take the desserts in 
[02:08:00]  Knowing it was from us  I'll tell you this too  Not only do you send him a bunch of cakes  Make sure there's one sandwich in there too  Yes  Because maybe it also  Maybe he'll say  Send all that away  But leave the sandwich  Leave the sandwich  And the chocolate milk  Mm-hmm  Ron  Oh yeah he likes chocolate  Ron why are you losing your mind  Because of the Iraq abuse  When Jimmy does the Jamaican guy  I just lost it  With the ice cream  His ice cream bowls  The bowls  They open the door  And what Jimmy's implying is 
[02:08:30]  That the bowls are stacked so high  And all over the room  That when they open the door  They didn't even leave enough room  To open the door  Before the ice cream bowls fall over  And the ice cream juice  Stains the carpet  And the kitchen has to send someone up to the room  To get the ice cream bowls back  So other people can enjoy some ice cream  Because they've used all the bowls  Nobody wants to go to his room  It's like opening a closet full of marbles  We say we have no boss man 
[02:09:00]  That was a great idea  The room service people  Are putting ice cream in their hands  And he's lapping it out  Like some sort of fat animal  Jesus Roland  I was just sitting in my office  His tongue is like an aardvark  Just flopping out  And lapping up every bit of treat  In the entire hotel  Every bit of treat  No one else can have treats  People are eating lizard feet  And leaves  See it would have been over for you Rock 
[02:09:30]  If you would have just fucking played along  For a couple minutes  Oh I know  But now we're going to talk about  How his girl has to apply the sunscreen  Like a hot mops on a rooftop  Like you ever see when they fucking  You ever see when they paint a car  In the fucking Detroit  Sunscreen

[02:15:30]  Whale noises  The mysteries of the deep  Right there  I see that  This is what the whales are saying  We have that bit  A little Brian Regan  Going into the break  He's low  I love that one  Sorry I'm making  Brian Regan  Travis is scrambling  Because we're doing  Four or five different things  At this same time here  Yeah  I would work here  A little Brian Regan  At the break  Oh of course  That's perfect  It really is  Oh  That E-Rock  I can't believe  He's being so negative 
[02:16:00]  He really is  You know  When you're with this show  You're like a police officer  You're never really off duty  That's right  If you see the opportunity  To be made fun of  And called a fat whale  Pig  Barnacles  Attach themselves to you  You can't jet ski  Without only your head  Sticking out of the water  You need a rocket ship  To go parasailing  You eat so much ice cream  In your room  That they run out of bowls  At the hotel  For the rest of the resort  Yeah  You eat krill 
[02:16:30]  You don't pay for your room  You're traded  Where people can swim with you  Don't forget the suntan lotion  Other tourists can swim with you  The suntan lotion  Manatee with feet  Yeah  Motorboats are striking your back  Oh it's great  And then  Taking chunks out of your flesh  Rumor has it  He was so cranky  Because yesterday  When he went down the water slide tube  Yeah  It ended with a guy at the end  With a giant plunger  Trying to clear the tube out  Very difficult  Like in Willy Wonka  When that fat thing  Got stuck in the tube  Yes 
[02:17:00]  He's Augustus Gloop  In the chocolate tube  It's supposed to be a water slide  Oh  And then the lazy river thing  They just renamed it after him  The E-Rock River  See because he's lazy  Oh thank you for clarifying  I didn't get that  Yeah I was a little muddy  Yeah  A little muddy  Alright  Let's do this  A little Brian Regan  Oh that's not fair  Whoa whoa whoa  He went snorkeling  And pilot fish  Attach themselves  To his underbelly  Pilot fish

[02:18:00]  Yeah  Alright  Yeah  Let's try to get E-Rock  After the break  Maybe he's calmed down  That would be nice  We definitely have  Vic Henley next as well  Brian Regan first  Here we go  I saw this documentary  Recently on whales  This guy has dedicated his life  To telling you  What the whales are saying  Wow  I don't know how you'd argue with him  When he turns in his report  And he just throws it down there  Well here's what the whales are saying  Okay  Thanks Charlie 
[02:18:30]  Just looking back  Here's what the whales are saying  Yeah Charlie figured it out  They show how he does it  He's out on a ship  He's got a pencil  And he deciphers the whale noises  As he hears them  You know  He'll hear like  You know he's like 
[02:19:00]  Oh okay  He's lonely  No you're lonely  I'd like to do that  For like two weeks  And then turn around  And find out that the door's  Squeaking behind you  Sirius XM  The Virus  You're listening to 
[02:19:30]  O.B. and Anthony  Got Vic Henley in studio  Brand new CD  Coming out what  Today Vic?  Last week actually  Last week  Alright  And you can get it  At VicHenley.com  You spell Vic  V-I-C  H-E-N-L-E-Y  VicHenley.com  Lewis Cruise  Is the name of the CD  It's the Lewis Black Comedy Cruise  Last fall  So  Right on  I had no idea  That they recorded anything  And I cleaned it up  And made it as good as this show  A little distracted  Because I saw 
[02:20:00]  On the hotline  They were trying to get  E-Rock on the phone  Yeah  We got another hang up  So that's your update  Another hang up  What the fuck?  Just talk to us  For a couple minutes  Man  Can't work the phone  With flippers  What a snot  What's he doing?  Are you hanging in New York?  Yes totally  I've been out  I just got home  Like a week ago  I'm about brain dead  From back and forth  Plains  I was in Nebraska  I was in St. Louis  I was down in Florida  Wait you live in New York?  I've lived here for 25 years  Wow  And you didn't get rid of that 
[02:20:30]  No I'm not taking lessons  No  My older brother took lessons  When I was a teenager  My older brother came up here  And was going to model  And he's 12 years older than I am  And like for a weekend  Once I was hanging out with him  And I watched him  Walk around the apartment  Going  A-E-I  Doing these things  I'm like you know  I used to look up to you  Fuck that  Exactly  That was the moment  You stopped being my hero  So  You just said fuck it  That's it  I'm going with the hillbilly  I'll keep it  That's it  Yeah exactly  No elocution  Wow that long  Yeah  I've been here 25 years  25  I didn't know it was that long 
[02:21:00]  Did you see the video  Of the guy naked on the train?  Oh absolutely  Being a New Yorker now?  We were talking about it earlier  That people just  In general  See crazy shit  All the time  In New York  And it doesn't bother them  They just go about their business  I've said it in my show  I think some of the  People masturbating on the streets  Are not perverse  They're just happy  That their trains  Hit all the stops  Sometimes  They just got from point A  To point B  In 15 minutes  Like they planned  I've seen the homeless guy  Shitting right on the corner  Oh god yeah  Not even behind a building  Or an alleyway 
[02:21:30]  Right on the fucking corner  And people will not even  Stop to check that shit  Not even bad at all  Right  I saw one doing  It was a lady doing it  And she had a straight razor  And was shaving half her head  Like eight years ago  Crouching somewhere  Down around 48th and 10th  Yeah  I saw a guy yesterday  And I'm not that crazy  I videotape a lot of stuff  But this guy looked like  He was going to fucking  Rip my face off  If I pulled out a camera  He was scraping the bottom  Of his feet  And getting a lot of dead skin off  Some homeless dude  My mom in the TKTS line 
[02:22:00]  A guy stood up off his cardboard box  And started pissing  And we were in the TKTS line  And my mom from Alabama  Like six years ago  Turns around and goes  Look we're trying to get tickets  To Phantom  Can you not really  Can you not do that  And I'm like  Mother you know  You're 70  I still think he'll punch you  Be careful  Yeah  Did he respond or no  No he didn't even  He just kept  He just looked at her  Like you're crazy  For talking to me  And just kept pissing  Like a stream  Why isn't Troy calling back  That's his whole job  Fuck everybody else  He's got to keep  Calling E-Rock's room 
[02:22:30]  Over and over again  We got to get him on  One more time  Before the show ends today  Earlier when we were  Talking about this shit too  A guy said when he was  In New York  He saw another guy  With a knife  Sticking out of his neck  And that didn't bother  Anybody either  No never  He obviously is walking  To try to get this  Taken care of  And people aren't even  Offering to help or nothing  They're not even  Offering to help  No of course not  They're like kind of  Bother that he's in their way  They're trying to get to work  Right  They've got shit to do  You know we bring it up a lot 
[02:23:00]  But fuck it  It came up I think yesterday  On Ronnie's show  Whatever show he's doing now  He does one with Sam  He does one with Fez  Oh it's amazing  How many shows he's doing  Yes  We did have a naked  Crying drunk woman  On the sidewalk  On 57th street  57th and 6th I guess  Right  And people were just  Going into the building  You know to start  Their work day  And they  They didn't stop  And wonder  Or ask questions  They're just like  Oh  Even with that show  Even with that ABC show  That's kind of popular  You know what would you do 
[02:23:30]  Even with the set up  That this could be a trick  Right  People are still going  No don't care  Doesn't matter  Doesn't matter  Having an abortion  Don't matter  In the elevator  Naked  Don't get that right  Naked  Naked and crying  Doesn't matter  And the one guy  Who did stop  And raped her  Right  Because he's old school  He's very old school  He's already crying  What else am I going to do  Well we might have him  We might have him  E-Rock 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  Who's going to kill her  With that  Who's going to kill her  Who's going to kill her  ...  ... 
[02:24:30]  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... 
[02:25:00]  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  Hmm, hmm. 
[02:25:30]  Hmm, hmm.  Cuck, cuck, cuck, cuck. 
[02:26:00]  I don't know. I'm not good. I don't know. 
[02:26:30]  Cuck, cuck, cuck, cuck, cuck.  He just wants to enjoy his vacation. 
[02:27:00]  He's in another country.  He needed a passport.  Ten minutes of just fucking whale silence.  Spencer Kay in Boston. Moody dick.  It's actually very soothing.  Yeah, it was.  It's relaxing.  I feel like I could take a nap right there.  Yeah, yeah.  And no one would blame me.  I wonder what I was saying to the E-Rock.  I don't know. He didn't want to respond. 
[02:27:30]  No. I needed a response.  Yeah, we definitely need a response.  Like Star Trek. I've got to bring him back.  You fucking can't even go with the bit.  What's wrong with this kid?  The one time we want him to hang up, he won't.  Right, right.  The bit still killed, though.  He was hanging in there.  Oh, that E-Rock.  All that to get him on the phone just to fucking work.  He'll never come on the phone now. 
[02:28:00]  Never.  He just wrote all of us.  Oh, really?  Glad you got a segment out of this.  Heard it all, assholes.  Oh, come on.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  E-Rock.  Lighten up.  Yeah, man.  I mean, literally, lighten up.  Jesus.  Have a salad.  Treadmill, anything.  Lighten up.  Oh, yeah.  Kevin in Houston.  Kevin.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Oh, man, congratulations, Aaron says.  You just won the most annoying 30-second contest. 
[02:28:30]  Yes!  Yeah!  Two grand.  Yeah, what do you got, brother?  Hey, just FYI, but there was a new two-head monster born in China this morning, so I thought  we could follow it.  Was it this morning?  That's an older story, man.  I saw that thing.  Did you see the two-headed, two-faced?  Oh, no, really?  I think it's just two faces on one head.  Two faces?  Yeah, man.  There's some fucked up shit going on over there.  Have a good day, boys.  Punch it out.  All right.  I'm really pissed at the Chinese anyway. 
[02:29:00]  Why?  What's wrong with the tinkies?  Yeah, and the dumb Pakistanis trying to fucking get our copter pieces.  Pakistan.  From that stealth helicopter?  Pakistan.  Pakistan.  And they're like, oh, yeah, let's just fucking give it to China so they can take a look at  it.  No.  No, they're teasing.  They're teasing that they're going to do that.  Well, then how about they let China give them $3 billion a year, those fucking bastards.  But they're teasing, so then we give them another billion not to do that, probably.  And why can't we just go over there?  Fuck the stuff.  Because they're our ally, and say, excuse me, could we have our copter parts back? 
[02:29:30]  Absolutely.  Like, you know, it's hard.  Fuck that whole country, man.  Now stupid John Kerry is going over there trying to smooth things.  Oh, great.  The fact that we have to smooth things over with this fucking, with these shit people.  Who are obviously hiding this guy.  Because we fucking killed a guy who killed, what, 3,000 of our citizens?  Yeah.  Literally, here's who doesn't like that we killed Bin Laden.  Bin Laden's family, Noam Chomsky and Michael Moore.  Fucking scumbags. 
[02:30:00]  And Rosie.  Rosie, too.  Rosie, too.  No, really?  She jumped on the bandwagon.  Really?  No kidding.  She wanted a child, too.  She said that he deserved due process.  He got it.  He got due process.  He got 10 years of fucking people giving him up.  10 years of it.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  Yeah, we tried.  Due process.  Nuremberg, they still hung him.  Nuremberg, they still hung him.  If you're going to go through, why?  Due process?  You're banging him anyway.  Was Hitler ever put on trial?  No.  So then why do we always say that Hitler did this, Hitler did that? 
[02:30:30]  If he never got due process, we have to stop saying that Hitler did it.  Don't be fucking assholes, people.  Oh, that's true.  Well, I've been trying to say that for years, Jimmy.  No one listens.  This was one of our best things.  I've said this forever.  We were really good at the super sneaky shit that we just pulled off here.  Yes.  Every now and then, we are really good at that.  Every now and then, Jimmy Carter, the planes don't crash, and we fucking get the bad guy.  And it actually works.  Yes, I have no problem with that ever.  No.  No.  And even Bin Laden's son has said that he should have been put on trial in front of 
[02:31:00]  a jury.  He said even Saddam Hussein was tried.  It's like, yeah.  And then look what happened.  Right.  It's not like he walked away.  It's a drive-thru.  Walking down the courtroom steps going, yeah!  Yeah!  I'd like to say to the press, I want to thank my attorney for getting me off of this.  It wasn't law and order.  When did ultra-liberals in this country become so fucking far away from everybody else?  When does America ever do the right thing in their fucking mind? 
[02:31:30]  I'm not saying we're not wrong a lot.  No, it doesn't matter what we do.  But when do they ever agree with the fucking military?  Ever!  If he was taken prisoner and put on trial, I think the liberals would have come out  and said something like, oh, do you know how dangerous this is?  We should have just left him.  Oh, yeah, it would be the other.  It would have been the other way.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  They'd flip up.  Kill him or something.  Right.  Like, yeah, this country can never do anything right in their eyes.  Do we ever get it right?  Like, I was fucking...  We did this time. 
[02:32:00]  I think we really did.  I do too, but, like, Noam Chomsky is such a cunt, like, and I was blasting him on Twitter.  Yeah, I know he's a brilliant guy, but you're not as brilliant as everybody thinks  if every fucking time your answer is predictable.  If you're that driven by an agenda, and every time I can pick your response, you're not that  smart.  Yeah.  Because then everything you do, you're trying to kind of shoehorn into your philosophy.  It's based on his bias. 
[02:32:30]  God, it annoys me.  Yeah, and Rosie was saying that, too.  She got on and said that he should have had due process of the law.  It's like, no, this is a situation where it's an enemy that obviously there was a war declared  on us on September 11th, at least, even before that, with some of the other stuff, shenanigans  he was doing.  And he got what was absolutely coming to him.  You're right.  I would have danced naked and gotten into me.  I would have made Abu Ghraib look like a tea party.  I would have had my balls on his head, a t-shirt. 
[02:33:00]  I'm with the dead guy.  I'd have been pointing an arrow.  I would have done that on the YouTubes.  I would have done everything possible.  I'm totally into the gloat on this one.  I would be gloating like the idiot that I am.  Fucking the hole in his head.  Right.  Would have just been great.  Or at least a dick on the lip.  At least a dick on the lip.  One dick lip.  Just one dick lip.  That's all I'm saying.  But you know what?  They're fucking still, they're still putting this scumbag son of his on the news.  I know.  Some Yemeni fucking yelled, Al-Akbar, and he ran into a cockpit. 
[02:33:30]  I'm fucking so fucking tired of this mentality.  God, he wasn't an innocent bystander.  He was the head of Al-Qaeda, and they should have fucking shot.  They should have executed him.  Years ago.  Finally, that's exactly what the military should do when they get an animal like that.  Kill him.  Although Patrice said that never happened.  Yeah, Patrice is all in with conspiracy shit.  Patrice says...  He's not dead.  He was intelligent about it yesterday.  He's like, just think about it.  One question. 
[02:34:00]  He goes, just start with one question.  Why'd they dump him in the ocean?  Because why'd they flush him?  We answered that.  Flush him down the ocean.  We answered that already.  He goes, really?  Really?  Mm-mm.  And then Patrice is going, mm-mm.  Really?  Really?  Like, everybody else that we capture, kill, and have the body.  Don't we do things like, even Jeffrey Dahmer, you take his brain, you look at it to see  what type of, uh, uh, the physical part of the brain that makes a person like that. 
[02:34:30]  Uh, look at his, hey, why didn't they do an autopsy and see if his kidneys were bad?  Let's see if he had any kind of diseases.  None of that was done.  He was just wrapped up in the Muslim tradition and thrown overboard?  Jeffrey Dahmer was not the fucking spiritual head of an organization where people will strap  bombs to themselves and fucking fly planes.  Osama bin Laden was a different guy because he's a fucking, he's a spiritual, he's like  the Ayatollah Khomeini.  Any of these fucking guys that are spiritual leaders for these fucking jihadist scumbags, 
[02:35:00]  you gotta get rid of them.  There's no place for them to go and celebrate where his body is.  There's no place, uh, again, and if he was kept alive, you fucking dummies, not you guys,  but out there, do you have any idea how many hostages would be taken?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How many fucking people would be murdered because they wanted him freed?  Mm-hmm.  Do you, people do not understand that?  Right.  But, but, but I don't understand not taking his body back to the U.S. 
[02:35:30]  Uh, you take him and, and just do a complete, like, workup on him.  Couldn't they do that on the ship?  Take his brain.  Abinormal.  I don't think so.  Abinormal.  Abinormal brain.  Abinormal.  This is abinormal.  Abinormal.  You don't think they could have done an autopsy before they dumped him in the ocean?  They could have done an autopsy, probably, but not that real studying.  Really just studied everything?  Maybe, maybe they took samples, maybe they took brain tissue samples and they kept them  so they could study some of that stuff.  Maybe they did that.  I think they thought it was going to be like Abu Ghraib in the Old West.  They thought they were going to fill him with lead and prop him up in front of the general 
[02:36:00]  store and take his picture.  Take his picture with the guys.  Hey.  And the wussies don't like that.  The wussy people in America, oh, we can't do that.  We can't do that.  We all want to see the pictures.  Absolutely.  We all want to see the pictures.  Good God.  I want it on a T-shirt.  And when the president says, you know, we're not that kind of people.  No, we are.  Yes, we are.  We are exactly who that is.  Look how many downloads that crazy naked guy on the subway got.  We love shit like that.  They got rid of the body.  It was a smart move.  They're not looking to fucking make America's pleas.  They're not looking to please the public, the fucking military. 
[02:36:30]  Nice.  Their job is, this is the best move.  There's no place to go celebrate.  He's gone.  He's in the wind.  And they don't care if we like it.  And that's that.  I actually agree with that.  And there's nothing we can do about it.  No, it's the old secret ninja American thing.  I said it.  I like it.  I have no problem with the secret ninja American.  Something on the death photos?  We're going to see the death photos eventually.  Because now the CIA is going to show the photos.  Eventually.  But they're showing the photos to some select U.S. lawmakers.  Of course.  So slowly but surely they're spreading this out.  We will see the death photos eventually.  Yes.  I have no doubt in my mind. 
[02:37:00]  They're showing them to the congresswoman to see if it'll snap right out of her head injury.  Well, they're showing them to the one idiot that bought the fake photo online.  Oh, really?  You heard about that guy, right?  No, no, no.  Really?  Someone fell for that?  It took us.  Fell for that old gag.  It took Danny maybe two minutes to figure it all out that this thing was a fake photo.  Right.  Because when it first comes in, you're not sure.  Obviously, you're like, what the fuck is this?  Danny did just a little research and we were the first to say, stop sending this shit  to us.  It's fake.  It's not him, right?  But an actual, was it a senator or a congressman?  Yeah, it was Brown from fucking Boston.  Thank you.  It was Brown fucking said he saw the death photo. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, God.  And it was the one we've all been looking at.  That one.  You've probably seen that one, right, Vic?  Oh, I've totally seen.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a fake photo made out of two guys.  That guy sold me a kebab yesterday on 7th Avenue.  Yeah.  And I did also see a piano playing kitten.  Which was very convincing.  Squirrel on water skis.  I saw a squirrel, yes, water skiing.  Fascinating.  Um, I actually saw, uh, two girls with one cup, apparently. 
[02:38:00]  That's right.  Uh, it was amazing.  I saw a very dramatic chipmunk who was stunned at something.  What?  Okay.  Uh, and, uh, I actually did see, um, uh, meat spinning, uh, for many, many times.  There's actually two others besides Brown.  Really?  When they told Brown, look, that's a fake photo, he said, oh, the photo that I saw, he released  a statement, and that a lot of other people saw is not authentic.  But then you had, uh, Kelly Ayotte, it looks like, and Saxby Chambliss, also claiming I've 
[02:38:30]  seen the photos.  While I was shown a photo by another senator of what appeared to be a deceased Osama bin  Laden, I do not know if it was authentic, uh, Ayotte, I guess that's how you say your  name, uh, said in a statement, however, I do believe a photo of the dead Al-Qaeda leader  should be released.  All right.  The photo I saw was shown to me by somebody who represented to me as bin Laden after he  was shot.  He said it looked like it was official.  That was the other guy, uh, Chambliss.  Is he the Georgia guy?  Is Chambliss Georgia? 
[02:39:00]  Sound like maybe.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought he was.  Saxby?  Yeah, I think I remember him from.  Saxby Chambliss.  Yeah, when he beat the Royals with that home run in 76.  That was a wonderful, I'll never forget that scene.  Well, with them slowly showing other people these death photos, we're going to see them.  We're going to see them.  Yeah.  No doubt in my mind.  Oh, yeah.  Norton with the sports reference.  Very good.  Excellent.  Excellente.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, this guy wants to comment on the Rosie situation.  Rich, Oklahoma.  Rich, what's up, buddy? 
[02:39:30]  Hey, Rich.  Rich, let's go.  Hi, buddy.  Actually, Chris, hey, I'm more liberal thinking in most things, but you guys hit it right on  the head.  Rosie O'Donnell.  I mean, what could we possibly get out of due process?  It's not like the guy fucking shoplifted a Playboy from a 7-Eleven on the corner.  He killed 3,000 Americans.  And all you've got to do is put this guy on trial and let all these crazy fucking Al-Qaeda  guys all over the world start killing Westerners and all for, so we can, what, give this guy 
[02:40:00]  probation or community service or lethal injection or whatever you think is due process.  Oh, first of all, he wouldn't get the death penalty.  They never give the death penalty.  So he would end up in a prison, he'd be a hero to the Muslims in prison, and he would  be living much better than he is now.  Like the guys in Goodfellas when they go to prison and be like that.  He'd be in the Muslim Goodfellas community. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's where it is.  Getting that.  Now we can eat.  Slicing the garlic with a razor blade.  And they would be murdering people, demanding the sheikh be released.  Yeah.  You can never have him captive because they would literally be suicide bombing, demanding  his release.  There's nobody as high up on the ladder as him in jail.  No.  Khalid Muhammad is not as fucking revered.  And they showed pictures of Saddam's sons because they weren't religious leaders.  Saddam was not a religious leader.  Fucking Azarkawi was not a religiously inspired guy. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  He didn't inspire people.  You know, he was just a fucking murderer.  He was more the nuts and bolts kind of guy.  Look at that headline.  Rosie O'Donnell, without due process for bin Laden, we may be monsters.  Right, right.  Oh, really, Rosie?  Look in the mirror.  Yeah.  You want to see a monster.  But it's just...  Oh, my God.  Put down the bowl of M&Ms and look in the mirror.  They're saying things just to be disagreeable.  The Taliban would have to re-sharpen their knife halfway through her fat neck.  But Saddam, we didn't... 
[02:41:30]  Why does it matter if it's Poussey and Coussey or whoever the hell we strapped their asses?  He was right up there and showed them.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the same...  He's even more revered.  But psycho, psycho.  Dead psycho, dead psycho.  But wait a minute.  Azarkawi was never put on trial.  He was killed in a bombing raid.  So maybe I guess we were monsters there because we killed him in a bombing raid.  Bombs, for some reason, are more acceptable than shooting someone right in the same room.  Sure, sure.  For some reason, that's an assassination.  But a bombing is like, well, we were going after some.  He was there. 
[02:42:00]  It was a deal.  We had some intel that this house was housing some operatives.  We dropped some bombs and we happened to get one of the big guys.  No one ever complains about that.  When it's that way, you're absolutely right.  When it's that, that's never any big deal.  If they would have gotten him with one of those bombs in Tora Bora when they said he was in those caves,  there never would have been any of this.  He was assassinated.  It's no trial.  They would have been, oh, wow, we got him.  Good.  Monstrous.  I want Bin Laden to saying that his fucking, the burial at sea demeaned his family.  How about the fact that your father fucking orchestrated these murders, you fucking scumbag? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  How about that demeaned your family?  How many families were demeaning?  God almighty, I hate these people.  Do you think Bin Laden ever threw a falafel against the wall and upset his son like my dad did with his spaghetti?  When I was a kid, my dad just threw spaghetti against the wall while he was having an argument with my mom,  and I remember that vividly.  Maybe that's what happened.  Some fucking hummus.  He threw the hummus against the wall.  My dad swung at my mom once, and she ducked, and he smashed his hand on the wall. 
[02:43:00]  It was one of the funniest goddamn things.  He must have been pissed.  We all burst out in life and then ran for fucking cover immediately.  Did he laugh?  No.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  He took a swing at her?  He took a swing at her, and she ducked, and he smashed his hand on the wall.  It's not a dinner cold?  Yeah.  Something important.  Absolutely, yes.  We got a question coming in.  Does Troy have new questions?  I would love to know what his new questions are, if he wants to come in.  No, no, I'm just saying, I like to ask.  If he wants to come in.  I like to ask, that's all.  David in North Carolina. 
[02:43:30]  David?  I just got a question for you guys with all this conspiracy theory stuff.  Attaboy, Dave.  Did the Navy SEALs just dump them off a dinghy in a white sheet,  or did all the guys on the ship that they landed on and buried them from, what did they have to say?  Well, we talked to a lot of Navy guys, and they don't make a big deal of that whole fucking thing,  and they wouldn't make an announcement like, hey, if you want to see us throw bin Laden in the ocean,  come on down and check it out.  Right.  They said the ship's so big that something like that can happen without not many people knowing about it.  Well, from what I read yesterday, also, there is rules that they have to adhere to for different religions, 
[02:44:00]  and the Muslim religion has this ceremonial washing of the body, and it's got to be done by another Muslim.  Who had to have that job?  I know.  And then there's got to be, and believe me, they have to wash the genitals and everything.  It's some weird fucking homo-Islamic thing that they have to do to the body.  I don't even know what the fuck it is.  But there's washing.  Then there's certain prayers that have to be said that wouldn't be comfortable for an American to be saying, 
[02:44:30]  like about how they want this person to be taken to a much better place, forgive him his sins,  like this whole thing that a Muslim cleric has to do aboard the ship that absolves him religiously anyway of any of his crimes.  I'm sure there's a Muslim fucking cleric.  There's a lot of Muslims in the Navy.  I'm sure they have to have clergy from every denomination. 
[02:45:00]  So for him to get a funeral that would have given him, and the Navy, so it says, has to adhere to these rules,  give him this dignified Muslim burial is fucked.  Yeah, it's awful.  It's fucked.  He should have been thrown out like fucking Chief Brody with the chum.  Like garbage.  Like Patrice said.  I was going to say, I used an aluminum can.  Don't even recycle him.  Right, yeah.  Yeah, no, it's awful.  It's terrible.  Like Patrice said yesterday, like cocaine being flushed down the door.  Charles Barkley's terrible.  That was funny yesterday. 
[02:45:30]  We needed that terrorist, Karen.  Yeah.  Because Patrice kept saying they flushed him down the ocean.  They're looking at washes.  They were going to wash his genitals.  No, they never would have done that.  What did you do?  Harry in D.C.  What's up, Harry?  So the people that compare this to like Nuremberg and those people got due process, there's one  major difference.  At Nuremberg, the war was over. 
[02:46:00]  Ah, very good.  The war on terror is not over.  Ah, correct.  Nice.  Good point.  Absolutely.  And also, Nuremberg's a different place.  That's totally.  It's not the ocean.  It's not the ocean.  I got a Nuremberg from McDonald's.  Oh, chip.  Oh, chip.  Hey, Vic Henley's here.  He's got a new CD available at VicHenley.com.  It's called Lou's Cruise.  It's the Lou's Black Comedy Cruise.  It's live from Lou's Cruise.  Oh, that's awesome.  That's why I named it that. 
[02:46:30]  Because I'm just fudging him.  V-I-C-H-E-N-L-E-Y.com.  Fudging off his coattails.  And we really got to take a break here because we got Paul Bettany waiting.  Yes.  Priest in 3D.  Priest in 3D.  In theaters Friday.  We'll talk to Paul next.  Stay there.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN at 3 Show.  Got a big star outside the studio, Paul Bettany.  Let's bring him in here.  I guess he's in Priest in 3D.  Priest in 3D. 
[02:47:00]  Vic Henley saw the posters.  How is he gambling?  Priest in 3D.  Priest in 3D.  Hello, Paul.  What's up, Paul?  Nice to have you, man.  Take a seat.  Very nice to have you.  Always looking very gentlemanly.  Yeah, this is...  I thought I should make an effort for you fuckers.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  He's lying.  He's doing TV.  Hey, who's he getting?  He's doing TV.  Yeah, you're right.  I've got Fallon.  I've been seeing the trailer out there. 
[02:47:30]  It looks pretty scary.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  It looks pretty goddamn scary.  We're really pleased with it.  Priest.  Are you typecast now?  Is it all just flying angels and priests in religious films?  I swear to God, this is the last movie with any religious connotation.  Really?  Just so I can avoid the questions.  Well, you've been in a few, sir.  I'm the hack.  That's why I ask it.  I'm sorry.  I got asked the other day.  A journalist asked me, is there something subconscious at work?  You know, in your choices?  And I went, well, I don't know. 
[02:48:00]  It's subconscious.  Yeah.  If it's subconscious, how am I going to explain it to you?  Dummy.  Who's old?  Who was...  You were in Da Vinci Code.  Who was...  Which character was Silas?  Because I saw that, but it's been a while.  He's the guy that beat himself.  You are, right?  Okay, wow.  That's great, man.  Yeah, that was...  So happy.  You know, it kicks me off the streets.  That was a sick role, man.  But, of course, Beautiful Mind was...  I still watch that one whenever it's on and think it's just a great movie.  The twist in that, the surprise... 
[02:48:30]  I hope I'm not ruining it for anybody.  How old is that movie?  I'm sure.  Ten years.  Ten years.  But there are little things you notice, like, you know, the little girl running through  the birds and they don't move and things like that.  So, uh, making that, though, movies like that and Sixth Sense, are you ever worried  that people are going to be like...  Because it's probably so obvious to you.  Are you ever worried that people are going to be like, oh, I think they're onto it?  Yeah, totally.  Because when I saw Sixth Sense, I went, okay, so he's dead.  What's his big...  Yeah, what's the big deal?  Immediately, right.  Totally.  You knew it?  Wait, you knew immediately? 
[02:49:00]  I didn't.  Yeah.  I was the dummy that didn't know.  I didn't either.  I was blown away by that.  I do this stuff for a living.  Yeah, he kind of does for a living.  That's...  I lie for a living.  That's my thing.  That's just a bullshit artist that gets paid for it.  That's not very bad.  I was looking up, like, some of your background and age and who you're married to and everything.  I was wondering, did you ever see Labyrinth and think, like...  Oh, God, yeah.  One day.  One day. 
[02:49:30]  I'm going to play that Bowie song and make out with her.  I'm going to play the Bowie song and make out with her.  It is a twisted little thing.  Now, Jennifer Connelly is your wife.  Yes, she is.  She's very beautiful.  Great actress.  And I was thinking, like, if he watched Labyrinth, that's a little twisted.  That's a little sick.  I was 12 at the time.  See, that's just it.  Because I was looking to see if maybe you were, you know, in your 20s going like...  Yeah, hunched double over the VCR. 
[02:50:00]  It's skeevy if he's in his mid-20s.  Yes, it's very skeevy.  No, I was 12.  You were 12.  It was all above Borden.  Same age.  Did you have a little crush?  Did you think she was cute then and everything?  Yeah, of course.  Who didn't accept 20-year-old men?  I know.  That's true.  Did you meet on the set of Beautiful Mind?  Yeah, we met on the set of Beautiful Mind, and I had never seen anybody that attractive up close.  Yeah.  Nice.  There you go.  So I thought, you know what? 
[02:50:30]  I bet every man she's ever met in the world's tried to sort of pull her, you know?  So I didn't do anything.  How do you make that move?  I just didn't make a move.  I just taught politics with her.  Wow.  That worked.  And it worked.  Wow, yeah.  First time ever.  You bored her into love.  Who is this?  That's amazing.  Who is this fucking idiot?  I'm going to sit on his knee.  I don't know.  Wow, that is fantastic.  Did you argue politics, or did you both completely agree?  We both completely agreed, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Because I know I would have blown it.  Like the hot chick, I would have fucking argued with her and just ruined it.  Shut up, you liberal idiot.  I just wrecked my chance.  I would have just wrecked it like an idiot.  And Russell Crowe, you did Master and Commander also.  My other leading lady.  Your other, yes, of course.  Russell Crowe, your other leading lady.  Was there something there?  Was it the same casting guy?  Or do you two have some kind of rapport with each other?  I don't know.  He didn't say no. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, he didn't say no?  You're not going to turn down a Russell Crowe co-starring thing?  I think he could have said no.  Co-starring thing?  You know, it was a Peter Weir movie who I, you know, I think he's one of the greatest directors there has ever been.  Did Witness, I believe.  That was my first thing.  He made a lot of great films, but that was his first Oscar nomination, I think, was for Witness.  And it's, you know, he's extraordinary.  And this opportunity came along and I was just hoping that I, you know, I hadn't pissed Russell off enough in the first movie that he was going to say no to me. 
[02:52:00]  So, because he could have, you know.  He an easy guy to work with?  Yeah.  I mean, it's so funny.  I would, you know, spend evenings with him and we'd be.  Oh, you lucky fella.  Would you talk politics?  Sweet talking him with my liberal views.  And, you know, then you read in the press the next day that he was in some bar having a fight and it just wasn't. 
[02:52:30]  It didn't seem, yeah, or it wasn't his character or anything.  Never saw it.  Did you ever see him with the band?  He has the band.  I didn't see him.  Were you invited?  20 odd foot of grunts.  No, I didn't.  Right, right.  That's the name of his band.  I love the two accents, by the way.  I love when Paul and Vick are talking.  The complete.  The hillbilly and George Jones.  It really is an odd.  George Jones talks to Prince Charles.  It really is odd that it's even the same language.  What's more strange is we actually studied together at the Royal Shakespeare Company over in London.  So a lot of people don't realize I have a classical trade acting background. 
[02:53:00]  Yes, they're sick.  Who knew that?  They keep stopping you and saying, look, there's nowhere in Shakespeare where they say, holy sheepship.  You're adding that.  Shitload.  Shitload.  Shitload is nowhere in.  You mentioned Prince Charles.  What was your take on the whole wedding thing?  It was stupid.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's a big stage to my dad was staying married.  It's this weird tradition in England where every 20 years the poor people of the country  scrape together $36 million to pay for two rich kids' weddings. 
[02:53:30]  Exactly.  That's why I say stupid.  And then what we get to do is line the streets and watch this strange medieval procession.  It's so peculiar.  Archaic.  You think they're in love?  They didn't give the feeling that they didn't like each other.  I just don't care.  You just don't care.  Like from the school of thought of most Brits that you really just don't care about this?  I really don't care and I was really surprised that it was such a huge thing over here. 
[02:54:00]  I thought, what was the point of your revolution?  It's huge here.  200 years ago, you got rid of them.  You had a constitution.  We haven't even got a constitution.  And now it's like, yeah, we love anything that goes on with the royal family, yet we were  trying to just get the hell away from there for so long.  I think it's because you can, it's not your tax dollars and you can just point fun at us.  Well, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  When I used to go there and work, it was at least 50-50.  I would crack some jokes and I would get 50% royalist, didn't like it, and they'd get 
[02:54:30]  angry and the other 50% would laugh and cheer.  Do you think it's more than that now?  That was probably 10, 12 years ago.  I read somewhere that it was like 30-70.  Wow.  That don't care at all.  What the fuck are we doing?  I just don't care.  I actually feel like, why have you, why have you, but you just, you know, I haven't even  seen the dress.  Because I just couldn't watch it.  But then I was thinking, maybe I should see the dress, bearing in mind I fucking paid  for it.  That's the best part, right.  We fucking love this guy.  Really and truly, what's going on? 
[02:55:00]  It is an odd thing.  And here, it's most of these, like, housewife-y type of women that watch soap operas and stuff.  And they love that shit.  They love the royal family.  Ooh, what's William doing?  What's, and like, who gives a shit?  Who gives a shit?  I'm going to put him on royal waiting snuggie.  He's stealing from you.  He's stealing from you.  He's stealing from you.  But what about Pippa?  Pippa was hot.  She has a great fucking dumper.  Oh, man.  She's got a nice hiney. 
[02:55:30]  She does.  What an ass I'm pissed off.  I love to talk politics with her.  Yeah, me too.  So, what did you love?  I don't know.  It is an odd thing.  I want to get back to, obviously, the movie, though.  What's Priest?  What's the gist of this one?  Well, it's a great big sort of science fiction action movie, which has a sort of revenge  plot, and he's trying to save his niece, played by the beautiful Lily Collins, and he has 
[02:56:00]  to defy authority to go and save.  So, he's vengeful priest?  He's a vengeful priest.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  That is good.  If it was just a guy that gave a sermon, it would be a boring movie.  Vengeful priest is very good.  It's hard to have.  There's not many Kung Fu fights.  Yeah.  No, he's like a special forces guy, and the war's over, and he's had to go back into,  been asked to go back into society, but been rendered useless for society by the things  that he's done, and now comes this one last mission is basically what the film is, and 
[02:56:30]  it's a really good excuse for a lot of kick-ass action.  A lot of good violence.  A lot of violence.  A lot of evil in this.  Some evil.  Yeah, if you like me stabbing vampires, you're going to like them.  Hey, is the church going after the film?  The Catholic church?  No.  You guys deal with that crap?  All of these, it's funny, all of these movies that I've subconsciously done.  Yeah, subconsciously.  They're huge in Catholic countries. 
[02:57:00]  I think they can take a joke.  I mean, really and truly.  They went after Da Vinci Code, didn't they?  Not really.  Well, here they get a little.  Here, they get a little fucking nervous.  I've never been stopped on the street by any Christian saying, I really hated that movie.  And if they did, I'd say, forgive me.  Now I'm good.  It's your job to forgive me.  It's the main tenant of your religion.  And I was reading, you used to be a Catholic, right?  Brought up Catholic now. 
[02:57:30]  Well, you know, I got slapped by a few nuns.  Now I was in an S&M club.  That's just my Sunday.  And now where are you at with that?  Atheists?  Me, yeah.  I mean, you know, clearly there's a creative force in the universe.  But is that creative force conscious of us or cares?  I think it probably feels the same way I do about the royal family.  He wants to fuck Pippa.  He wants to motorboat the buttcheats of Pippa. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, we all got questions about that shit, so.  Yeah.  Organize religious life.  When does the film open?  Friday?  Friday the 13th.  Oh, there you go.  Nice.  That's nice.  That's good.  It's a lot.  The kids, they love that.  Yeah.  They love that Friday the 13th.  Let's go Friday the 13th.  Go see a scary movie.  Exactly.  It's going to be a good date movie, scary movies, by the way.  Absolutely.  Because girls will always latch on you a little bit. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, a little bit closer, lean a little bit closer.  Yeah, yeah.  Make that journey with your arm a little bit shorter.  Oh, yeah.  Years ago, the original Friday the 13th came out, and I am of the age where I did go see  that in the movie theater, and it was released on Friday the 13th.  And I went with a girl, and we sat in the back.  That's good.  And the whole time, had each other's hands down each other's pants.  Nice.  It was fantastic.  It's called Looking for Jason.  It was great.  Yes, yes.  It was great.  Your hands smelled like the inside of his hockey mask. 
[02:59:00]  Exactly.  She was giving me the old Voorhees, I like to call it.  Do you have a strange erectile response to horror movies there?  Maybe you shouldn't go and see Priest.  No, maybe I shouldn't.  Well, it was a different time.  That's all I can say for that excuse.  It was a different time.  No, I'm sure they're still doing it in the theaters.  You think they are?  Yeah, the youngsters.  I don't think so.  The youngsters are fucking in each other's pants.  Oh, they hope so.  He sounded 80, Dad.  Did he?  The youngsters.  Did he? 
[02:59:30]  Are you a new dad?  Did I hear that right?  How old are your kids now?  I got a 13-year-old.  I got a 7-year-old, and I'm about to have another one.  That's what I mean.  Okay.  You're about to have another one.  I'm about to have another one.  Wow.  By that point, no nerves anymore, right?  No, nerves, yeah.  Really?  This is my family.  My brother's 12 years older than I am, and my middle brother's 7 years older than I am.  You do not really want to do this.  I don't think.  That really works out for us. 
[03:00:00]  That really works out for us.  You're going to get punched.  I'm just saying.  I can't wait for you to get punched, man.  It's got to be the work schedule, right?  It's in my day.  He's English.  He's not going to hear me.  I think it's when an actor and an actress are together.  This is something you shouldn't do.  I kind of did it about nine months ago.  Yeah, I know.  It's a little too late.  Thanks for the fucking advice.  Maybe I was projecting.  It's a little too much for me.  Is it hard, a working actor and actress, to raise a family?  I mean, it just seems something.  Not really.  You just choose not to work all the time, you know? 
[03:00:30]  Otherwise, you know, sometimes you regret not making a movie, but in 20 years' time,  I look back and somebody else has raised my kids.  I'm going to fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not going to be able to hold my head up, so...  That's got to be a rough decision, though, because what if you see a really good script  and you're like, fuck, I really want to do this, and then...  You just look at your kid going, dad, I want you home.  And you go home, you know?  I mean, it's really simple.  I can't do Wimbledon 2.  If only.  Do you get jealous?  We had Sandra Bullock's ex-husband here, and he said that when she kissed people on screen... 
[03:01:00]  He's not an actor.  He would get very jealous.  Do you get jealous if you see your wife kissing another guy on screen, even though you're in  the business?  Is there a party that's like, ugh, I fucking hate watching that.  It doesn't actually worry me.  I totally...  I mean, we never talk about work, ever.  Really?  Oh, wow.  I don't know any actors.  I mean, I really don't.  I don't know any actors in New York City.  I live here.  I've lived here nine years.  Nobody I know is in the business.  I just, you know, I just...  That's actually really good.  That's amazing.  Yeah, because actors suck.  So this guy's probably... 
[03:01:30]  I really think they suck overall.  Thank you, Paul.  There you go.  Exactly.  Validation.  A large number of them really suck.  Yeah, there's not a lot going on, usually.  Does it bother you, though?  Like, when you watch that, you won't get uncomfortable?  You're totally...  It doesn't...  I really...  I just think of the change coming in.  You know what I mean?  I'm like, yeah, that's a bunch of dough.  Yeah.  Actors are assholes, though.  And my girlfriend can attest to this, because first, I heard something, and I thought it was  you at first, because she was living out in L.A. for about five years, doing modeling 
[03:02:00]  and acting and stuff.  She's in New York now.  And she said, yeah, this guy from Beautiful Mind sent me an email and just was being a  real dick, trying to, like, trying to just fuck her.  That's pretty much what it was.  And I was like, is this motherfucker that's coming in?  I swear to God.  And then I realized you were married.  You were married too long for that.  And then I'm thinking, wow, I could really blow up his spot if it is this guy.  But it turned out to be a guy from Beautiful Mind, but it was one of the other friends 
[03:02:30]  that were in the bar with him in kind of his college.  I bet I know which one.  I'm not going to say.  Oh, wow.  I'll say it's the same guy that was also in the Christian Bale movie, fucking American  Psycho.  Ed Harris.  No.  Christopher Plummer.  No, no.  He sent a picture of his cock in the Glen Gary fucking leaves.  Christopher Plummer was trying to bang your girlfriend.  What a fucking cocksucker.  No, the, uh, I wish I could remember his name, but, uh, no, it was, it was. 
[03:03:00]  Maybe you shouldn't say his name, though.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  No, I got the emails with the names on it.  It happened.  Oh, you got emails.  Fuck this guy.  I read the emails.  He's a real prick.  They're going to come to L.A. and, uh, hang out with me and this, that.  And, you know.  Oh, I didn't know you had the email.  Oh, yeah.  Was that bad?  Was he mean to her or just to ask her to come to L.A.?  No, he's being a smarmy fucking actor.  Recently or now?  And, and you know what?  It's very hard as a low rung of the totem pole fucking, uh, radio guy for me to hang 
[03:03:30]  on to a model.  So, you know, leave me the fuck alone, guy.  When did this happen?  Oh, this is recent.  This is recent shit.  Recent shit.  I thought this was what she lived out of.  Let me, I, I, I swear, I, I.  Can you read one of the emails?  Let me, uh, oh, I.  Oh, please do.  Please, please read one.  Yes, in a second.  By the way, you preached in 3D.  You preached in 3D.  I went in a second.  In theater's Friday.  Are you worried some fucking hot actor is going to take your chick?  Look at me.  All right.  Yeah, but you're funny, dude.  I struggle.  Yeah, funny goes, funny goes so far.  I'll tell you.  But your big cock goes the rest of the distance. 
[03:04:00]  Anthony's all cock.  I'm telling you.  That's why she likes you.  You're funny.  You have a mansion, and you drink like a fish, and you're a big dick.  You're fine.  I am a fun guy.  Yeah.  But, uh, 30-odd.  Did you, uh, 30-odd for a girl?  Did you do a horror movie together?  I don't know how to treat a lady, diddling her to front of the 13.  I jerked him off during the ring.  It's wonderful.  I jerked him off during the ring.  But just so you know, we've all seen Jimmy's cock.  If you need to know, Paul.  And he has a legendary one that no one has seen.  He played, uh, Craig McDermott in American Psycho. 
[03:04:30]  He's Josh Lucas.  You know Josh Lucas?  Oh, I kind of know that guy's name.  He's sort of a new looking.  Josh Lucas.  Here's his picture.  Let me see.  He's kind of nerdy.  If it's a guy I think it is, it's a nerdy looking guy.  You know this guy.  No, no.  He's kind of a handsome fucking guy.  Oh, that's not him.  I don't need that shit.  No.  He was not.  You mean Josh Lucas?  He was the couple.  Paul Newman.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  He looks like a young Paul Newman motherfucker.  You're in fucking trouble.  That's intimidating. 
[03:05:00]  I know.  Fuck his emails.  Fuck you and your emails, Josh Lucas.  You're in fucking trouble, man.  Lay off, prick.  I am shocked.  All I got is 3,000 miles of fucking countryside keeping my fucking relationship intact.  How did he meet her, though?  How did he get her email?  And he said, oh, somebody sent it.  And she goes, you're being a fucking asshole, and I want to know who sent it.  And apparently it was her ex-boyfriend's friend, that was his chick, hooked him up and was  like, yeah, I think you'd like this girl. 
[03:05:30]  And instead of being like, you know, kind of break the ice thing, it was, why don't I  fly out to L.A. and stuff.  And then I started thinking of my email, which was, why don't I fly out to New York?  So I'm just as big a prick, and she's susceptible to this kind of crap.  So he was going to hear the email?  Huh?  Well, she has it.  I don't have it.  She has it on her phone.  But I'll bring it tomorrow.  I see her now, she's fucking laughing her ass off at me.  See, she'll fucking text you the email.  I would love to hear that.  All right.  Hey, copy-paste the email. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, we want to read that, man.  Why are you screaming in the microphone?  Fraulein Stetten.  Copy-paste the email into the chat.  Wasn't he the head coach in the El Paso movie, the basketball movie?  Oh, yeah.  Gene Hackman.  He's been in a few.  Gene Hackman?  Gene Hackman is trying to fuck my girl.  That's allowed.  A horror movie?  That's allowed.  A horror movie or something.  How funny would that be if she left you for Gene Hackman?  Wouldn't that be fucking...  You could almost just love her for that. 
[03:06:30]  Totally.  Totally.  At least it was Gene Hackman.  She's going for someone younger?  Nice.  Nice.  A little self-deprecation.  I love it.  You know how it is.  I like this show.  Oh, my God.  I'm taking you to see Priest this weekend, sweetie, and I'm going to finger you in the  back row.  Jesus.  That's Friday the 13th.  It's a tradition.  You old smoothie.  He's going to finger in 3D.  That's great. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Too goddamn much.  You called him on everything.  Now, you obviously, you're an actor.  You're a good-looking guy.  Now, but Jennifer Connelly, very attractive girl, very attractive woman.  Have you ever...  I see where this is going.  Have you ever worried...  Do you want her email address?  Have you ever worried, like, you know, like...  I'm going to check for Josh Lucas's emails.  Yeah, watch his fucking emails.  This Josh Lucas is a wily one.  Watch your back, baby.  I got an update on Josh Lucas. 
[03:07:30]  Do you?  He lives in New York, according to his Wikipedia.  Well, he lives in New York and LA.  Oh, he's one of...  Okay.  Yes, yes.  Maybe he doesn't know she has a boyfriend.  I am shocked.  He does now.  Yeah, come on.  I bet he desists.  He does now.  Season desist, Josh.  Twitter that, motherfucker.  You never worried about that, though, the attractive girl, but you see, you're a good-looking  guy, though.  See, that's different.  No, no, no, no.  It's got...  You know, you just got to...  You know, every guy in the world...  Is trying to pick her up.  Yeah, so...  Exactly.  Just live with it.  Right?  You just deal with it?  Yeah, you just... 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, you guys have been together for a while, though, so it's like, you know...  I was going to show you a year, right?  You make fun of that?  Hey, listen.  And when we're walking down the street, you know, I see people looking at us, and I  know they're thinking, how did she snare him?  See?  That's exactly it.  Lucky girl.  That's how I deal with it.  A total pig-headed decision not to look facts in the face.  That's called confidence.  That's called confidence.  I have to deal with one-way locks on my doors. 
[03:08:30]  I'll let you out when I get home.  Yeah.  You treat her the way that fucking German guy treated his daughter?  I was going to say, incest dungeon girl.  Yes!  Incest dungeon girl.  It's called you in the basement.  Great relationship.  It's wonderful.  I figure any woman who's attractive, who's sleeping with me, is under no illusions that  I'm fucking really that handsome.  Like, they're fucking me for a weird reason.  They're not going to leave me for a better-looking guy, because they wouldn't have been with  me to begin with.  Oh, hey, that's a good... 
[03:09:00]  There's no chick that wakes up and just realizes I'm fucking mediocre.  I love how Paul's looking at you like, is that how it works?  Well, for a guy like me, yeah.  I was thinking that maybe you weren't held enough as a child.  Or too much, unfortunately.  By the bus running to wrong people.  By strangers.  By buddies.  By buddies.  By buddies.  Mailman.  Whatever.  Uncle Ernie.  However it works.  Yes, a man cuddled me with a face in a fucking pillow that smelled like motor oil. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  That was beautiful.  Oh, wow.  But no, Paul, you're a good-looking guy, so a good-looking guy has to be careful.  Jesus, this is the best room I've ever been in.  I'm never leaving.  We're pawing over you here.  No, but a handsome guy has to look at another handsome guy and go, well, is that a possible...  For me, it's other stuff that would get a girl to leave me.  So you have to look at a scallop and go, perhaps I'm threatened.  Wait, that guy has man tits and erection difficulties.  He's a threat. 
[03:10:00]  Holy shit.  That guy has an appendix scar.  Look out for him.  Are you dragged sometimes to some of these Hollywood events and awards, movie premieres that you're just like, ugh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because you really don't come off like the kind of guy that would appreciate the Hollywood lifestyle thing.  Seriously, we're in Vermont, and I'm outside grilling.  Is that what you enjoy?  I swear to God, if I'm at a premiere, it's because I was in the movie. 
[03:10:30]  You have to be there.  All my wife was in the movie, and that's it.  And then you don't really get much trouble.  What do you guys like to do for fun?  Because it's odd.  For the layman to think of an A-lister Hollywood couple, what do you do for fun?  I like to play guitar.  I have a place up in Vermont.  We have a music room.  I have a PA system.  Everybody comes up, and we jam. 
[03:11:00]  And I go home with the most beautiful groupie every night.  And my wife likes to hike because there's no fucking paparazzi up a mountain.  And if there are, I could kill them.  I buried them, and nobody would ever fucking know.  Do they hassle you to paparazzi when you're out together?  How enraging is it?  Well, if I've ever got a movie coming out, it gets kind of, I kind of tend to look quite  different in the movies I do, so I don't get, you know, as bad as my missus.  And she, but when she's got a movie coming out, it's pretty fucking tough. 
[03:11:30]  But, you know, you've got a fucking movie coming out, and I don't mind.  But these motherfuckers are outside my kid's school.  Now, in England, if your kids are there, they can't take a picture.  You come out, and you see them, they go, oh.  Really?  Yeah, it's against the law.  Yeah, they can't do it.  And what other world?  Wow.  What other world?  That's great.  I'm a dad, right?  That's wonderful, right?  I'm a dad.  My kids didn't choose it.  I come to pick them up from school, and I see some guy in a fucking hoodie taking pictures 
[03:12:00]  of my children.  Wow.  You want to fucking kill them?  No shit.  What other dad wouldn't?  You know, I'm supposed to suck it up and go, oh, it's all right.  There's this pedophile taking pictures.  And if you weren't an actor, you could probably get away with punching the guy in the face and  in court going, hey, this guy's taking pictures of my kids.  But for some reason, that's like your fair game.  No, they want you to smack him.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, they want to sue you.  Oh, yeah, they do.  Hey, Mike Epps is getting sued.  The fucking comedian. 
[03:12:30]  I just heard he got served with papers on stage.  Holy shit, what a heckler.  That's a heckler.  Wow.  What a heckler.  What a heckler.  For nothing.  What a heckler.  Oh, yeah, he gave it to him, too.  You white bitch.  There was something with a paparazzi that happened.  I don't know what it was, but apparently, like, gunshots were fired.  That's just what I heard.  I hope that's true.  Wow, that is taking it.  But I heard a lot of those guys have fucking, I heard a lot of those guys are fucking, I  want to say Brazilian, and a lot of them have guns and they're here illegally. 
[03:13:00]  Like, a lot of those paparazzi for the one group have, I've heard.  It's not like a cartel, the paparazzi cartel.  They've never seemed so menacing.  No.  I've heard that.  Sounds like a good movie.  Some of them have guns.  In 3D.  Because one of the groups, one of the big paparazzi companies or whatever is named  after, I think, the gang name or the jail name or something.  Jesus.  My manager told me.  That's a little intimidating, yeah.  I got one of them real good one time, which I can't go into because I don't want to get 
[03:13:30]  sued by the fucker because I saw his other guys all around and I got him behind a building  before anybody could, you know, take pictures.  All of his other guys could take, oh, I'm so fucking quick.  You hit him?  You hit him or punched him or shoved him down?  I made him stumble?  I really fucking smacked the shit.  Just look at his face and I can figure it out.  Oh, nice, okay, all right.  How did it feel?  It felt really good.  It felt so good.  Yeah.  It felt so good.  It happened another time when somebody, one of them, my little boy was really little and  he was, you know, I had him strapped to me, not in a weird way, not with like, you know, 
[03:14:00]  duct tape or anything.  Not like Norton's childhood.  Yeah, like your child.  No, no, no motor oil or anything.  I just had him in a, what do they call them, Baby Beyond thing.  And this guy is trying to get a picture of my wife and he pushed me out of the way by  putting his hand on my kid and pushed me like this.  So he's pushing my kid.  So hand on the baby on the chest.  And he's got the camera to his face and I went, I don't know what happened. 
[03:14:30]  His evilness went into me.  I just, your honor, you know, and I just, I just, he went down to the ground and I don't  think he knew what happened because the camera was here.  I just thought maybe I walked into it.  Yeah, a bird flew into your camera, dude.  Wow, you okay?  I don't know what happened.  That's a paternal instinct, the Elba.  It's good.  Oh my God.  Fucking vultures.  They are the most, that's awful.  And they serve a purpose and I know a lot of times celebrities text them and tell them  where they're going to be. 
[03:15:00]  They really do.  They have a weird relationship.  They further your career.  They serve a purpose.  What is going through your head?  I mean, what, what is wrong in your life that you're calling up people to come and take  pictures of you, you sad, twisted, you sad, twisted fucking child.  Narcissistic, fine idiot.  There you go.  That has to be something where you're, you know, your popularity is way in the shitter.  I mean, if you have a movie coming out or something or an album, like Britney, they all  know how to use the paparazzi.  Actually, fuck it.  I ain't going to text them now. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, go text them now.  I'll be leaving the, you serious, asshole.com.  Asshole.  Asshole idiot with the camera.  I'm sure your camera is well up to your eye so you can't see my elbow.  I know I'd send the wrong fucking text to the wrong paparazzi.  Like, I'd think it was somebody else.  Like, you know, hey, your ad said you were fully functional.  Oh no.  This is the paparazzi guy.  Yeah, well, that's, um, yeah, look at it.  Time flew, man. 
[03:16:00]  Sure did.  You're a very fun guy to hang out with.  Thank you very much.  I must say.  Priest 3D.  Priest 3D.  This Friday.  Friday the 13th.  This Friday the 13th.  Take your girl, do whatever you want in the back row, but enjoy the movie.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Paul Bettany.  Good luck with the baby, too.  Or just buy a ticket and go home.  I don't mind.  It doesn't matter.  As long as the purchase is made.  Just buy the ticket.  Buy the ticket.  Don't take his picture.  You can do a lot.  I know.  I'm scared to take a picture right now.  Friday the 13th is a fucking... 
[03:16:30]  I want to tweet a picture.  I don't know if I should do this.  You can tweet.  You can see the movie.  You can see Priest 3D if you're in Washington, D.C.  Oh, Jimmy.  You can see the fucking anti-social comedy tour at Constitution Hall.  Nice plug.  Yes, with myself and Dave and Brewer and Bill Burr.  You can do both.  Of course you can do both.  But not during this weekend.  Don't go and see that.  You can see my movie.  All at once.  You can see the movie on Saturday, too.  As long as it's in the opening weekend.  Huge opening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We want a huge opening. 
[03:17:00]  I want to go to a 3D movie because I only saw Avatar.  I want to see another one.  Really?  I just felt like stopping the room with a boring fact about myself.  Well, thanks for that.  It works.  I said, how can I bore everybody and include me?  Wow.  You look funny.  You look funny.  He is funny.  This was nice.  Vic, where are you going to be, man?  I'll be at the cellar this weekend, the comedy cellar here in New York City.  Yes.  So, yes.  The wonderful legendary.  The comedy cell.  The comedy cell.  The comedy cell.  And you got that CD out, too. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  It's live from Lewis Cruise.  Buy the CD.  VicHenley.com.  That must have been.  How is that being cooked up with Lewis Black on a cruise?  Well, it was more fun watching Panette almost go over the rail several times.  Oh, wow.  Really?  To see a 900-pound man actually lose his tipping point is a physics-defying moment that I'll  never forget.  Yeah.  Center of gravity got a little.  Absolutely.  Got away with it a little bit.  He's a funny fucker, man.  He's hilarious.  No, he's absolutely amazing.  Yeah.  But 78 tequilas, and he almost, I was holding him, and it was a weird moment.  Oh, yeah.  I hear you like to tip a few back.  I always love when I hear comedians fucking, like, Mr. Wake Up Calls. 
[03:18:00]  I always love when comics have fucking problems.  Right.  Comes easy from somebody that doesn't drink.  Yeah, of course.  It's, you know, sometimes, yeah.  You like a little drinker?  Yeah, no, I would be lying to you if I said, yeah, I like a little bit of, you know.  Yeah.  What's your point?  My problem really is, I've never found a drink I don't actually like.  I mean, I've found drinks I like more than other drinks.  Right.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, this is like us.  You're as bad as us now.  I know.  I'm the same way.  I'm the same way.  It's just kind of good.  I got a Guinness tap in my bar in my basement. 
[03:18:30]  Sweet Jesus.  Which is just, and actually, I got to make a call because it's like, I need another.  Like, I used to, back in the 80s, it was like, you know, could you bring over a gram?  I need a gram or an eight ball, whatever the fuck you got.  Now it's like, yeah, I need a keg of Guinness.  No, I need it now.  I'll pay extra, please.  I have the same thing with a fucking wine store.  I become one of these wine snobs just because I have to put my addiction some way.  I like a good Shiraz just at night, sitting there, sipping it down. 
[03:19:00]  Not like I'm a classy guy.  I'm watching some shit show on television.  He balances.  Yeah, but you know, the thing about me is I like a nice Shiraz, but I don't mind a bad Shiraz either.  You know, you're absolutely right.  I don't care what it is.  Any kind of red shit you got.  Oh, I'll unscrew a cap.  I'll pop up, whatever it takes.  I'll open the box.  Thunderbird.  You remember that?  Yeah, I don't care.  What's the word?  Good stuff.  What's the word?  Thunderbird.  Thunderbird.  Oh, my God.  Well, Paul, thanks for coming in, man. 
[03:19:30]  Just a pleasure.  Really nice talking to you.  I've enjoyed watching you for years.  It's very cool.  Pretty 3D.  Friday the 13th.  Yes.  Very good, man.  Let's get the fug out of here.  Yeah, we'll see you again.  Paul, thank you so much.  Paul Bettany, everyone.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on The Virus, Sirius XM. </pre>
