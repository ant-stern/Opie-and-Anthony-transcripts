<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment heavily focused on Brett Favre's allegedly explicit photos and text messages sent to Jen Sturger.  Opie and Anthony, along with the off-air Jim Norton, engaged in graphic descriptions and speculation about Favre's penis size, Sturger's motivations, and the overall situation.  The conversation frequently digressed into other topics, including a planned production piece compiling Anthony's past flirtatious encounters with female guests, a comedic idea for a Mick Foley intervention, the upcoming Jets-Vikings game,  negative opinions of Snooki, brief discussions of Demi Moore's pubic hair and an interview with Scott Weiland, and several listener calls. One call discussed Favre's large hands, another involved an apology for eating government cheese, and a lengthy exchange with "Lady Trucker" saw Anthony criticize her online persona. The overall tone was highly informal, chaotic, and filled with profanity and sexually explicit jokes.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about unpleasant bathroom experiences. One host described building a "chick nest" out of toilet paper, followed by a story about a waitress at FH Riley's (where one host is a silent partner) being reduced to tears and vomiting after cleaning up feces in the women's restroom. The hosts debated the relative repulsiveness of finding feces in men's versus women's restrooms, concluding it was more disturbing in the latter.  This led to a discussion of Demi Moore's pubic hair, comparisons to a rug and Mr. T's mohawk, and reminiscing about changing trends in pubic hair grooming.  The hosts used humorous and exaggerated descriptions of the challenges of sexual encounters with extensive pubic hair. The conversation then shifted to the estate tax, estate planning, and anxieties about death and finances, including a humorous anecdote about their finance guy's insensitive comments.  The segment concluded with a discussion of "man caves," including listener calls and debate on whether they are inherently homoerotic, with suggested alternative names like "gay room" or "cum basement."  Studio guests for this segment were Joe DeRosa and Colin King.  Scott Weiland was also mentioned as having been interviewed earlier.

The following segment initially centered on "man caves," sparked by a caller's anecdote about her husband's late-night conversations. The hosts and callers engaged in sexually charged banter, with offensive language.  A caller's description of his man cave as a "fortress of solitude" led to a debate about the appropriateness of his use of "four little cunts" to refer to his daughters. The conversation then shifted to *Pulp Fiction*'s man cave scene, Ving Rhames's appearance, and his scarring. Further listener calls about man caves followed, transitioning to a discussion of Jen Sturger and Brett Favre, including playing several of Favre's sexually suggestive voicemails and graphic descriptions of the leaked image.  The hosts criticized Sturger and discussed double standards.  The latter half featured in-studio guest Seth Green, promoting "Control TV."  Discussions included the project's boundaries, the participant's background, Twitter, imposters, *Robot Chicken*, *Star Wars*, *Avatar*, and gaming.  Joe DeRosa's interactions were prominent throughout.  The segment ended with Seth Green's departure and the hosts commenting on DeRosa's apparent infatuation with Green.

A later segment focused on Seth Green unexpectedly showing the hosts a video of his wife after the show. This led to discussions of Anthony's unsuccessful attempts to pick up women, specifically Jennifer Sturger. Audio clips of these attempts were played.  The conversation also included crude commentary on a news story about the disparity in earnings between thin and overweight women. The show concluded with the guests (including Colin Kane and Joe DeRosa) plugging their projects and a final exchange of insults and jokes amongst the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers from the stand.  Opie and Anthony on Satellite Radio.  Host Anthony Kamiya and Greg Opie here.  On the commercial team, Opie and Anthony are apologizing for yet another apology.  Common profanity like a rap.  Is this the last straw for the Rocky Radio Zero?  Yee-haw! Yeah! Come on, bring it on.  You know what? I think this is hilarious.  A whole big bunch of fun.  The greatest show on Satellite Radio today.  This show is like the box of chocolates that Forrest's mother was talking about. 
[00:00:30]  You're a no-good son-of-a-bitch.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  What's going on?  I do what I'm told.  Completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on, it's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yee-haw!  Yee-haw!  It's Friday!  Oh, you gotta love that, don't ya? 
[00:01:00]  And not a day too soon, Judy DeAngelis.  Man, are we company men.  We are company men starting on time like this.  I know, it's crazy.  We don't have to start on time ever.  Oh, my God.  Eee-reel!  It's Friday!  Friday!  It's Friday!  It's Friday!  Millers, millers, millers. 
[00:01:30]  They was all over a beer.  They was up there.  They had a beer.  They didn't have no beer.  And they won a beer.  They were hanging around to get a beer.  The mailman gave me a dollar.  I was just talking.  They were all over a beer.  They probably took this beer and they shot him.  The beer we have, it drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser and what is it?  Millers.  Miller?  Miller.  It drank pretty good, don't it?  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  Come on, you're fucking in my beer, Tom. 
[00:02:00]  Fanny Porter!  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Kiss my fat ass!  I hate this place.  Oops.  Oops, I didn't mean to push that one.  Remember that one?  Wow, that's weird.  O&A brought you up!  See, I meant to push that one, not this one.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Years.  Years. 
[00:02:30]  They give contracts to people to do an hour show.  Been here for seven years.  We've been here for six years.  And we still have to work like you-know-whats.  Wait to hear the latest deal this company made.  Holy crap.  Yeah?  Yeah, but they had no money for us.  Oh, well.  I'm sure it'll be in the press today.  Will it?  It's a doozy.  Just want to make sure it's real. 
[00:03:00]  Before I start spewing.  Could be a rumor.  Friday, man.  And a lot to do today.  Oh, yeah.  Who's coming in?  We got fat girls making less money than thin girls.  Of course.  We got Brett Favre's tiny little penis.  His cute little wee-wee.  I want to call it a wee-wee.  There are pictures of Brett Favre's wee-wee.  Brett Favre's wee-wee.  Yeah.  And, God, I hope most of the guys listening to us have a bigger penis than Brett Favre.  Oh, God.  For your sake, obviously. 
[00:03:30]  That's the most pathetic wee-wee picture ever, if you're going to send a girl a wee-wee pic.  So you're safe to say, the guys that do this radio show, myself, Anthony, and Jim Norton,  we're doing just fine in that department.  Well, you know.  I mean, especially after you see the Brett Favre picture.  Compared to Brett Favre, you know, yeah.  When he puts his hand on the whole thing, if it's his penis, are they still questioning it?  Are they?  Is it alleged?  But, I mean, everything else in this story has been true. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  So I'm not going to doubt it.  Yeah, he's not denying anything.  Yeah, there you go.  But he's holding it in this picture we're looking at right now, and it's almost like,  it's almost disappeared.  It's half-assed.  It's just fucking, it's, his hand is taking up three quarters of it.  Easily.  Easily.  I mean, if you put your hand around your ding-a-ling.  Your junk.  Let's call it a ding-a-ling today. 
[00:04:30]  We're going to call it a cock.  I want to go with ding-a-ling.  Brett Favre, if he does that.  Only his little mushroom head pops out of the fist.  Yeah.  Barely, right?  What's he doing there?  Why are you sending pictures of that if that's all you're sporting?  Jeez.  Or at least figure out how to fucking take a picture in such a way that it looks like a monster.  Yeah, use forced perspective.  Perspective.  I think he's a little too self-important, a little too full of himself that he thought, look. 
[00:05:00]  Not that full.  Exactly.  But he thought, you know what?  I don't care how small I am.  I'm fucking sending this thing out.  Yeah.  Well, now people are saying maybe he's got big hands.  And I got to say this.  Fuck Jen Sturger.  We had her on the show.  We had to talk about some boring sports show she was part of.  She had this knowledge when she was in here.  You think she wanted to come on our show and talk about a Brett Favre Center cockpit?  Why not?  She's now, you know, sending out the text messages and the pictures. 
[00:05:30]  Why not?  She's smoking.  Yeah, she's smoking.  But we had a boring who gives a shit interview with her when she had all this info that she had in her head.  Right?  Yeah, but she ain't going to fucking spill the beans like that.  She's now spilling the beans.  Why not spill it on our show?  She was spilling it.  No one would see Brett Favre's cockpit unless she decided to, you know, send it out there now.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  She wasn't, you know, someone else didn't pick up on this. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  She had to push this story forward.  I just know some people probably don't want to spill the beans right here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Why not?  Ah, they look at it like, you know, this isn't quite the, especially if they want to, you know, do it on their own terms.  Yeah, she is smoking, though.  Yeah, you can see, like, the picture's on the cover of the, you know, the cover of the New York Post.  She's just looking great right there.  Favre accused of sending Jets Beauty sex photos.  Sex photos. 
[00:06:30]  And she's doing some sexting, too, right?  Or was Brett Favre doing the sexting?  Brett Favre was trying to text her.  Who, by the way, before we start is going to get his ass kicked by my and Anthony's New York Jets this coming Monday.  Exactly.  Monday Night Football.  Bleeding Jack Green.  I might have to take Monday off just so I can get ready for the big Monday Night Football game.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking about it.  Absolutely.  Because you've got the Islander-Ranger game in the afternoon, and then you've got the Jets-Favre freaking Monday Night Football game.  It's a whole sports weekend.  I don't have time to do radio. 
[00:07:00]  Got fucking Yankees twins on Saturday.  Exactly.  It's just too much shit to do.  Too many distractions to do a radio show, I'm thinking.  Exactly.  Sam, you understand, right?  I do.  You're not a sports fan, so you don't understand.  Turn your mic off.  Go ahead, Anthony.  I can't.  I don't have access to it.  Oh, well, oops.  Oh, that hurt.  That's just hurtful.  We're talking sports, Sam.  Go play with your wrestling friends.  We'll get to you eventually.  You know that thing that isn't sports at all? 
[00:07:30]  Sports entertainment.  Huh?  Sports entertainment.  That's not sports entertainment.  Yes, it is.  It shouldn't be called...  It's just entertainment.  It shouldn't be...  Somebody thinks of it.  It shouldn't be called sports entertainment if Ric Flair is still wrestling.  He wrestled a match last night.  Yeah, I know.  Live on Impact.  Yeah, I know.  No, he didn't wrestle.  You showed me the clip.  Well...  That wasn't wrestling.  He wrestled a book last week.  Yeah, he wrestled a book.  And that was an old, old man...  Right.  ...trying his best on his horrid knees with his bad back, trying to bounce off the ropes. 
[00:08:00]  To do a leg drop on a fucking book.  But then, last night, he wrestled Mick Foley, last man standing.  Didn't we talk to Mick Foley and tell him, get the fuck out of this business before it  kills him?  Yeah.  Can we go rescue him?  He's coming back in soon.  Do we have a SWAT team that listens to this show?  Because we need your services.  We gotta go...  We gotta go save Mick Foley.  Yes, it's over.  Yeah.  He would be a great commentator.  He was a great commentator.  He was, but he couldn't handle Vince McMahon's bullshit. 
[00:08:30]  So now he's gotta wrestle Ric Flair, who's pushing, what, 60-something now?  Yeah.  I'm thinking Mick Foley intervention.  It has to happen.  We bring him in and tell him, look, we love you, and then we all read a statement and give  him an ultimatum that if he doesn't leave wrestling...  We could play clips of him at his age wrestling Ric Flair at Ric Flair's age.  Oh, boy.  What's going on with our friend?  We've had Mick Foley on our show off and off for the last, what, 10 years now? 
[00:09:00]  Easy?  Yeah.  Except for last time when we darted out the door.  Yeah, he ended up doing special delivery to his surprise.  All he saw was, like, when cartoon characters leave the frame and they leave that whirling  smoke.  That's what he saw as we went to the elevator.  Yeah.  And his interview suddenly became an interview with Sam Robertson.  Sam Robertson.  You're an obsessed fan.  Yeah.  Great.  The guy he sat and fed meat to.  Oh, good.  People are trying to get their Brett Favre packers joke together with the small penis. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, okay.  Like, Green Bay let him go because he wasn't packing.  Ah, right.  Like, there's a joke there, but they're still, like, circling and trying to figure it out.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  So, all right.  Where were you?  So, what...  Why did he stay with Minnesota?  Because he couldn't pack.  No, well, Green Bay.  Oh, Green Bay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because he...  There's a Packers joke in there somewhere.  Packing, Packers.  Well, packing. 
[00:10:00]  Small penis.  Oh, I don't know.  There's a joke there, though.  The joke is in his hand.  That's so bad.  That's so bad that he's got that little tiny pee-pee.  Wow, she gets naked, too, this Jen?  All right, it might be her.  Is that Jen Sturger?  Might be her.  What do you mean?  It has to be her.  That's her right there.  On the left.  We didn't get this version of her on our show.  She's kind of prudish.  Yeah, talking about some sports show that no one's watching.  Get nude for us. 
[00:10:30]  You're a broad.  Makes sense.  Broad's on radio.  Get nude.  Did I make a half-assed attempt to get her to my house?  Yeah, it was awkward for everybody.  I know it was awkward for everybody, but, you know...  It's worth the attempt.  But at least you're trying.  I mean, I figure you put the vibe out there to enough girls, it's called the attitude.  Yeah.  The awkward Anthony pickup thing is always fun for everybody.  Yeah, I know.  Doing it in front of about a million people.  It's so awkward.  I just get overwhelmed at times. 
[00:11:00]  Because you're trying to seg into it, like, you know, very seamlessly.  Yeah.  It never comes across that way.  It's just very awkward.  Tripping over my own shoelace is awkward.  It's like...  I can't really shoehorn it in naturally.  It's like, hey, it's Tuesday.  What are you doing Saturday?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not even Friday yet.  So, you got boyfriend.  What do you do?  Like, what do you like to do?  She's trying to act like this studio is the place to be.  Damn.  This is the place to be.  Would it be a lot of work? 
[00:11:30]  Because I understand, you know, you guys are like us.  You don't want to work too hard.  That's not true in all cases.  Really?  When are you going to prove that wrong?  I've been proving it for years.  Hey, Jen, kiss me.  You won't regret it.  Can we get some kind of collection of all the times Anthony hit on the guests?  Oh, wow.  I think that's a great project.  There has to be...  E-Rock is the archivist, and your description of people not wanting to work does fit E-Rock.  Wow.  So, it would be difficult.  So, we should have that by February, hopefully. 
[00:12:00]  That would be a great, very awkward me trying to hit on every girl that came in.  No, no, fuck that.  We need it right away.  Oh, no.  The Anthony single years.  It's just been a fest of girls coming in and me trying my best to pick them up.  Shawnee Smith was on the premiere of Law & Order L.A.  Really?  See, that was another big one.  She loves you, too, Anthony.  I know.  And then you had Mila.  Mila Jovovich.  You did that chick from that movie with the Twilight guy. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  The blonde that was in that...  Oh, you had the blonde girl from Lost.  The only reason she came in, because the movie was a bomb.  Couple of interns from other shows.  Yeah.  Couple of...  Can we get this together?  I don't see why not.  The penthouse chick.  The penthouse broad.  Oh, I forgot about her.  Who I actually went out on a date with, and nothing came of that.  That was nice.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  How do you not finger pop a penthouse broad?  I don't know.  It was impossible.  He's yelling. 
[00:13:00]  I know.  How do you not get that done?  I so thought I was in.  We have to get that together.  It should be doable, because we just look when we have female guests.  Exactly.  And then break it down to good-looking female guests.  And then that's it.  And then just get my audio, because you know I made a fucking...  Can we get a montage?  A ham-handed attempt to get that over my house.  Do we go production piece, or do we go with a lot of different examples of Anthony trying to pick up... 
[00:13:30]  Tony Clifton's daughter.  People are...  Oh, I forgot about that.  They're bringing up a lot of...  Forgot about that one.  A lot of people here.  There's a lot.  I remember that one.  There's a lot.  I think there's enough that we can make a highlight disc, and then a production piece.  Let's do that.  Wow.  I'm thinking length here.  That means a lot of work for everybody.  Oh, wow.  We don't need anything from us, right?  It doesn't work.  Yeah, we could sit out this whole thing, right?  We know better than to ask.  Yeah.  Well, I was here until about 10.07 yesterday.  Yeah, but that's who they were normally here.  Jill before the relationship.  Okay. 
[00:14:00]  That was the Jill thing.  Because that was going on.  But that one worked.  I want the ones that just went nowhere.  No, no.  Because the first time she was on...  It didn't go anywhere?  It didn't quite go anywhere.  Okay, that's fair enough.  Right.  But...  Female football player from Long Island.  Now they're coming in.  JD in New York City.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the female football player.  The Long Island one.  Yeah.  That...  She was a bit talkative.  The lingerie bowl.  Yeah, the lingerie bowl.  Yeah, the lingerie bowl girls.  Yeah, yeah.  This is what people don't understand.  We don't need show prep meetings. 
[00:14:30]  That we've already thought of two bits.  Mick Foley intervention, and Anne tries to hit on girls' production piece.  We do it on the air.  It's on the air.  That's how our show prep should be.  We take you in to the show.  Yeah, I worry about Mick Foley.  But I was telling Anthony, he should be okay, because really fat guys, like fat, mushy  guys never had to do steroids for Vince.  So I think Mick Foley will have a very healthy, long life.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but the implication there is that Vince McMahon is forcing people to do steroids.  Well, I don't know if he ever forced them to do it, but it was certainly part of the 
[00:15:00]  culture, Sam Roberts.  Certainly part of the culture.  And in WCW, too.  Remember X-Pac.  I don't acknowledge any other wrestling league.  I wasn't trying to pick up Ben from Lost.  I was just very excited that he was on the show.  Passards.  All right, let's do some radio, Ant.  That's almost 6.30.  Of course.  What's the Brett Favre thing all about?  Well, he was a naughty boy.  But look, he's a single guy, right? 
[00:15:30]  This isn't a marriage scandal.  And he did things that we all do.  I thought he was married.  Where am I at with that?  Was he married?  Was he?  Did he get a divorce?  What happened?  Was he in the middle of a divorce?  What do we know about Brett Favre?  We need, like, a sports guy in our show.  Brett Favre.  Travis, was he married?  You're the best one to ask.  Yeah, I think he's still married.  Oh, shit.  Then that is a scandal.  That's why this is scandalous, Ant.  Then that is a scandal.  Oh, he's been married since 1996 and has two daughters. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, see, so maybe you shouldn't be texting your penis to anybody.  Oh, shit.  And a grandson.  Oh, boy.  What?  That's what Wikipedia says.  I can't get behind that.  Oh, boy.  Well, you know, Wikipedia.  Wow.  You gotta watch that.  Yeah.  People could just update it.  Apparently, yeah.  Joe DeRosa found that out.  Yeah.  Maybe it was a teen pregnancy.  Oh, boy.  His oldest was born in 89, so.  Maybe Brett Favre's daughter could be on Teen Mom.  That's a good show.  It's all the rage, those teen moms. 
[00:16:30]  Look, look at that.  See, here's the problem.  Other people are noticing his tiny little wee-wee.  Because if we look in the New York Post, there's two jokes.  Give me a paper, please.  Two jokes right from the start.  Fourth and inches is the headline.  And the first sentence is, he went deep and came up short.  No way, right?  Ah, they're all making fun of his little wee-wee.  You don't think he's hitting bottom ever? 
[00:17:00]  No.  Where are we, brother?  Over here.  I got you.  Former Jets quarterback Brett Favre allegedly threw a Hail Mary pass to a comely young sideline  reporter for the team, sending her an embarrassing slew of steamy propositions and lewd photos,  according to a sports news website.  Who was embarrassed by these?  The public.  Brett Favre.  He wasn't.  I would say this.  He wasn't embarrassed sending them, and I bet you she wasn't embarrassed receiving them. 
[00:17:30]  No, I don't think so.  But now that the wee-wee pictures are out, I think he's embarrassed.  But now they're embarrassing for everybody else.  The voicemails of MySpace message, as well as three raunchy pictures of men's genitals,  were posted in this cringe-inducing two-minute video on the sports blog, deadspin.com.  The string of emissives and voicemails were purportedly an attempt by the married grandfather  to charm buxom brunette beauty Jennifer Sturger, who is currently the co-host of The Daily Line. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, that's the show she promoted.  I know.  On our show, instead of talking about this.  The gray-haired grid-grate, the gray-haired grid-grate, sidestepped questions yesterday  at a press conference in Minnesota, where he now plays for the Vikings, who will play  the Jets Monday night.  Yes, yes.  I'm not getting into that.  I've got my hands full with the Jets. 
[00:18:30]  Well, you certainly don't have it full with your wee-wee.  Small dick.  The gravelly voice, caught on tape, sounds remarkably like the quarterback propositioning  Sturger, 26, a form of Playboy pin-up.  Do we have that audio yet?  I sure hope so.  Do we have that audio?  This is voicemails from 2008, when both were with Gangrene, the Jets. 
[00:19:00]  In one, for avaravary, allegedly drones, just got done with practice, got meetings here  for a couple of more hours, then I'm going back to the hotel to just chill.  So send me a text.  I'll be in the building for a couple of hours, but I know, unintelligible, came up and asked  you for your number, or gave you my number.  But I understand.  Send me a text.  I'd love to see you tonight.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Bye. 
[00:19:30]  So, I want to know her side of this.  I don't know.  Are they even...  Is she talking?  Yeah.  I want to know her side of this.  Deadspin reported the Maxim model would not comment on the record about the messages,  but told the site last winter that she joked to a Jets executive that she wouldn't date  someone as high-profile as avaravary because she, quote, might end up in a garbage can.  Why?  Interesting.  I don't know.  Shortly after she made that comment, she received another voicemail from a deep-voiced 
[00:20:00]  desperado.  So, in a garbage can, huh?  That's what you think?  That's what you think I think of you?  Hmm.  All right.  I'm still trying.  Just got done with practice.  I'll try the other phone.  If you could make it, it'd be great.  All right.  Later.  A MySpace message to Sturger, purported to be from Farababarary, was first posted by  Deadspin last summer. 
[00:20:30]  It was sent to Sturger by someone with the tag, Screaming Lord Byron.  You know, you got to make names up.  I saw you in the tunnel at the game last week.  Got your name from the front office.  I'm new to the team with gray hair.  All the info I could give.  Wow.  All the info I could give.  Wow.  He certainly did cover up who he was there.  He sure did, Anthony.  Thank God.  New to the team, gray hair.  Right.  The message read, Sturger allegedly told Deadspin in August that she didn't want her name attached 
[00:21:00]  to the tawdry tail and that Farabarary wasn't her type.  I don't roll that way.  That way meaning old or married, according to an email the blog reprinted.  Sturger's manager, Phil Reese, told the Post that almost...  The almost too hot for TV hostess...  Oh, let's slow down.  Yeah.  She's all right.  She's pretty hot.  She's hot, but, you know, let's slow down a little bit here.  She had no comment yesterday. 
[00:21:30]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, the Post sent a detailed email message to Farabarary's agent outlining the allegations  and the message was left with his assistant, although the agent did not respond to questioning.  Wow.  All right.  That's all you need to know about the Brett phone.  I want to hear the, uh, the voicemails.  If they're available.  Yeah, because then we could get maybe, you know, listen to the voice and go, yep, that's  him.  All right.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Staten Island.  Charlie.  Yeah.  He doesn't need a big dick.  He's got a big wallet.  So it compensates. 
[00:22:00]  See, Charlie...  Not true.  Not true, man.  I mean, I...  Every guy wants a nice-sized dick on him.  And a girl wants you to have a nice-sized dick.  And it doesn't matter how much money you have in the world.  If you have a small penis, it's going to bother you no matter what.  And the chick's just going to...  You finally get her because, what, you got cash and then you pull out that fucking little  wee-wee and she's going to be like, ah, I'll find a guy with cash that has a dick.  Right.  And I think when the girls say that the size doesn't matter... 
[00:22:30]  I think most girls do want some kind of size.  Size matters when, like, you got a little wee-wee.  If you're average, a little above average, that's fine.  If you got a giant cock, with some girls, that's fine.  Other girls don't like the giant, giant cock.  Well, then you get into the size queen thing.  Some girls are size queens.  Yes, like Jimmy Norton.  The bigger the better for them.  Let's get Walt on the phone.  Walt.  What's up, fellas? 
[00:23:00]  What's up, Walt?  Hello, Walt.  Come on, you got to get...  Walt!  Let's go, Walt.  Walt!  I'm coming!  Come on, guys.  You got to lay off this guy.  I mean, his wife had cancer a couple years ago, breast cancer.  You know, I want to try some real boobs.  Oh, jeez.  His father died.  He's probably so depressed over that.  You know, he's a poor little baby.  He's a bit stressed.  So you're thinking it's like a little bit of the stress of some tragedy.  Always good to dive into some nice young vagina. 
[00:23:30]  That's right.  When you've had tragedy in your life.  Right.  So, yeah.  So, I mean, coming into a new state, new team, you got to have some, you know, comfort in your life.  This guy's bringing up some great points.  All he needed was his root yanked.  That's it.  He needed to go into that hotel room with the young playboy pinup and get a little.  Let me...  He was probably talking to Tiger Woods again, so I'm input on him, you know?  High-profile athlete.  How'd he do this?  What do you want me to do?  Similar situation.  Oh, my God.  Are they doing a Snooki spinoff show? 
[00:24:00]  Please say it's not true.  Enough with this Snooki broad.  Sorry, Anthony.  Distracted.  No, no, no.  Believe me.  This computer screen's all over the place and TV screens, so things pop up as we're going to  We're trying to talk.  It's an attention deficit disorder show, which is great.  I don't mind.  I was just looking at the Snooki picture.  You saw it too, right?  I was making the butthead face.  I don't know why it disgusts me so much, because there's a lot of people that are famous for  no fucking reason, but she takes the cake.  Why is she famous?  Not only one little slice, either. 
[00:24:30]  What did we say?  Because she's fat.  What did we say the other day?  She was a tree stump in a black dress.  Yeah, tree stump, a fire plug.  Beautiful way to describe that mess.  Uh, there's pictures of me trying to pick up Jennifer Sturgis.  I mean, uh, uh, pictures.  Wee-wee pictures.  There's audio of me trying to pick her up.  Of course.  You found it?  Yeah, of course I did.  This is the same broad that's involved with the Brett Favre situation.  Hey, I gave it a shot.  I didn't send a dick pic, but maybe I should have.  And this is the beginning of our, uh, our look at Anthony picking up, trying to pick up 
[00:25:00]  every female that has entered this studio.  Well, I didn't try to...  In the last...  Linda Blair.  Why didn't you?  Because she's too fucking...  I hear, you know, she...  She's had Rick James.  I don't go where that's gone before.  Well, you gotta go Exorcist Pussy.  Nah, I ain't going Rick James fucking dick fucking.  I ain't following up that.  Please.  Exorcist Pussy, though.  That's a story to tell your friends and family.  No.  Yeah, it is.  I don't want to...  There's no way.  I would take Linda Blair if she was the age she was in the Exorcist. 
[00:25:30]  Jesus.  Nah, maybe Caged Heat.  All right.  Here's our, here's our pal, Anthony.  This is the start of a bit the boys are just starting to work on.  Basically, we've noticed that Anthony has awkwardly tried to pick up every girl that has come into  this studio.  Yeah.  Yeah, this isn't quick, so if you want to stop it at any point, just let me know.  Oh, great.  Because it kind of just goes on.  I probably want to stop it immediately.  All right.  Let's, let's...  How long is this?  Uh, well, I haven't, like, condensed it down to a specific time. 
[00:26:00]  How about...  Can't E-Rock just run through the audio and get some highlights?  Because we can go back to that.  If you want to do that, we can do that.  That's good.  E-Rock, work!  Yeah.  Because we got too much to do.  We can't do that...  Sometimes we do what's called kind of killing time radio.  Yeah.  But we actually have so much to talk about today, we can't do that, Travis.  Did I try to get Lily, too, at one point?  What?  Yes.  I think I tried to get Lily...  Almost everybody.  I tried to get Lily on a threesome.  Almost everybody. 
[00:26:30]  Let me go to, uh, Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  What a horn dog.  Jesus, Anthony.  I don't think anyone's blaming you, but it's...  Well...  But it's about time we talked about it.  Uh, Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  First time, long time.  And what does that mean?  He waited.  He wanted one of those responses.  We're going to be here a while.  You're going to be here a while.  Let's just get this over with.  No, it's going to be quick.  Listen, uh, Brent Bar's wife make a trade.  Listen, his wife's going to trade him for Adrian's theater song. 
[00:27:00]  What?  Again, another conversation you'd never have.  Right.  At a party, at your house.  Right.  Uh, on a subway platform.  When I run into old friends, they don't go, you know, first time, long time.  Yeah.  Because we haven't talked in a while.  Let me go to Aaron in, uh, Utah, it looks like.  Aaron?  Aaron.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey.  Hey, boys.  Hey, man.  I want to hear how you can give, like, Chris Maddox Russo's take on this.  Oh, you'd like to hear that, would you? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Well, maybe if, uh, Anthony feels like doing that, he'll do that for you.  Do you got, uh, do you got a little treat for me?  You can rest it, you can rest it on my head and then go, wait, wait.  Okay, get it.  What am I?  Your puppet.  I might do it later.  All right, we'll, uh, we'll work it in.  Kevin, uh, Wisconsin.  He's a, he's a cheese head.  Cheese head.  Are you a cheese head?  Yeah, man.  All right, what do you got, brother?  Yeah, I want to let, uh, Anthony know you got it all wrong. 
[00:28:00]  I met Brett Favre, uh, right around 2000 up in Green Bay there one time.  And this son of a bitch has hands the size of a goddamn dinner plate, man.  And that's, that's kind of why he's always good up in Green Bay.  He can hold the ball because he has such big fucking hands.  You know, when it's, you know, 10 degrees outside, he can hold the ball because they're  still fucking huge.  Yeah, the hands don't have anything to do with the dick, though.  Well, the picture we saw this morning, it looks like his penis is in 10 degree weather  as well.  Yeah.  His hands are twice as big as mine, man. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good for you.  I'm sticking with the fact that, uh, it looks like Brett Favre has a, uh, a small fucking  ding-a-ling.  It just looks like a little, a little dick.  It's a, sorry.  Yeah.  It's not a nub.  And it's relative.  It's a, it's like, take his hands completely out of the picture and you can tell it doesn't,  it still doesn't look.  Well, we got the voicemail, so.  Oh, nice.  Jen Sturger's voicemail is from probably Brett Favre.  Vararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararar 
[00:29:00]  for a couple of hours.  I'd love to have you come over tonight. 
[00:29:30]  But I know, I think Aaron came up and asked you  if you would give him your number  or he was going to give you my number.  But I understand.  But give me a text.  Love to see you tonight.  All right, talk to you later.  Bye.  That's so him.  He has no game. 
[00:30:00]  No, he was really dull.  He doesn't have a game, man.  Come on.  Wow, that is really dull.  And I really like to see you.  I like to see you.  Yeah.  I got a little dick here at the hotel.  So in some garbage can, huh?  Well, that's what you think I think of you.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, I'm still trying. 
[00:30:30]  Just got done with practice.  I'll try the other phone.  You can probably call her ID.  But you can make it.  It'd be great.  All right.  Later.  Well, on top of it, he sounds a little desperate.  Yeah, yeah.  Brett doesn't like Jen's response after his people talk to her.  No.  So his people talk to her people or whatever.  About ending up in a garbage can.  That would be probably his phone number or something.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well.  Well, well, Brett. 
[00:31:00]  Married, too.  Oh, boy.  That's bad.  I think we have to turn this into Dicktober now.  Let's do it.  Cocktober.  Cocktober?  It's got to be Cocktober.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  This launches Cocktober because...  I guess you're right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jocktober, October, Cocktober.  You're right.  Jock's Cocktober.  Right.  That poor fuck.  Why would you do that?  Just getting a...  Who talks into a voice fucking recording device? 
[00:31:30]  What's wrong with you?  If you're famous like that and you're just trying, you know, it's not good.  That ain't good.  Hey, how you doing?  It's Anthony.  Hey, it's 10 o'clock and 10 seconds.  I just got done with the show.  Why don't you give me a call? 
[00:32:00]  Dumb Brett Frawberry.  So that story is obviously developing.  Yes.  Unlike his dick.  Yeah.  Well, what are you going to do?  Stopped at about eight years old.  I can't wait to see Monday Night Football, Jets-Vikings.  You think they'll bring it up?  You think some of the newscasts...  Of course not.  They'll make believe it's not even happening.  Yeah.  That's what they do, right?  Yeah, they won't bring it up.  At all.  If anything, it'll be like, you know, Brett Favre, maybe he's got things on his mind with  all this controversy that he's involved in, broiled in. 
[00:32:30]  They won't even go that far.  They won't go that far?  Nope.  Nope.  Oh, boy.  I guess we're hypocrites today.  David in North Carolina.  David.  Hey.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  You guys are playing into the same shit that you were, that Jimmy made such a good argument  against the other day.  I mean, I know it's Brett Favre.  I hate stupid people.  I hate dumb people.  I know it's Brett Favre.  Yeah.  I know.  I know he should grade on a curve because he's calling from North Carolina, but this 
[00:33:00]  guy's a dummy.  I want to see what he says.  Go ahead, David.  I don't even know his point yet.  Yeah, you do.  Really?  Yeah.  He's going to call us hypocrites.  Go ahead, David.  Why?  Okay.  Now, I mean, maybe not hypocrites, but this is the same kind of invasion of privacy.  I know it's Brett Favre.  I know he's a celebrity, but this plays into that same thing where, you know, you, you,  God damn it.  Um, you know, you, use your, use your big boy words.  You boys are feeding the beast is what you're doing. 
[00:33:30]  Basically, you're saying you were bitching about the kid that killed himself because it  was online.  Now you're talking about Brett Favre.  But see, if you were listening closely when we went and discussed that the other day,  we, we admitted to everyone that we'd certainly do that.  Yeah.  But the, the, the point we were making was someone like, uh, Perez Hilton, you can't play  it both ways.  You can't draw cum bubbles and cocks in people's faces and then, and then, uh, say that cyber 
[00:34:00]  bullying is wrong.  Right.  We're not, we're not getting on the air and now apologizing or not even apologizing, but,  but talking about how evil it is to, uh, to do this.  Right.  We're, we, we, we admitted to everyone that we do just that.  This is our show.  We do just that, but then you're not going to see us now in front of a webcam saying  how bad cyber bullying is.  That was the whole point we're making the other day.  Yeah.  Oh, I see your point.  I understand it.  But the thing is, we are what we are, sir. 
[00:34:30]  I know.  I know.  Hey, I'm just as God made me.  I love the show.  Love you guys.  But the thing is that.  Do we give him a butt?  That, that, that, that.  No.  All right.  No butts for you.  No butts for you.  I don't want to hear a butt.  He got his point.  Right.  We made ours.  Right.  Go fuck your mother.  Right.  And that's where we're at.  Yes.  What's wrong with him?  A lot of people saying, does Brett feel cyber bullied?  Ah, boy.  Watch the bridges.  So you think he'll jump off a bridge over this? 
[00:35:00]  Ah, with that little cock pick out?  Wow.  That's what, you know also that they're all just going to be printing in the locker room.  They print out the picture and they're just going to be stuck all over the place.  What?  Pictures of his little dick.  What about when they line up on Monday night?  Oh.  Hey, Brett, you got a small dick.  Oh.  At least the center's got nothing to worry about.  He just can, he can bend over with a clear mind that he's safe and sound. 
[00:35:30]  You think teams do that, though?  To get to him?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right on the line?  Oh, they'll just do this.  They'll be going, you know, making little finger things like, yeah, that big?  That big?  Right.  As Brett's trying to, you know, call his play?  Oh, yeah.  You think they're whispering shit?  Yeah.  You think that shit goes on?  Hell yeah.  Oh, fuck.  They're going to be smack talking his little dick?  The whole game?  Yeah.  Probably quoting some of his fucking voicemails.  As they're sacking him?  Yeah.  As they're just fucking- 
[00:36:00]  Just before they get up?  Pounding him?  Yeah.  Oh.  I sacked you because I couldn't dick you.  Ah, see?  Because his sack is bigger than his dick.  Nothing?  Yeah, that was a reach.  Breaking bread.  That was a reach.  All right.  Anyway.  So we got that.  All right.  We should take our first break, because after the break, I want to talk about Demi Moore's  Bush.  Oh, wow.  That's real, right, Danny?  That's astounding.  Oh, yeah.  But I mean, that's not- I mean, those pictures have been floating around for a little while. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they hit yesterday again, so everyone's talking about it.  Our pal at whatwithtylardurndu.com posted them again, so-  They are amazing.  So they're- everyone's talking about them today, so we got to go back-  Just amazing.  And discuss Demi Moore's big, huge, over-the-top Bush.  I want to see it.  I want the picture in front of me.  You haven't seen it yet?  No, no.  I've seen it, but I want the picture in front of me when we go on and talk about it, so  I could really get into the conversation.  Right.  It is just ridiculous.  Yeah.  So we'll do that. 
[00:37:00]  Also, if you're a fat girl, you make a lot less money than the thin girls out there.  Ah-ha!  Woo-hoo!  They got stats and everything today.  That is just on-  I love that fucking giant Demi Bush.  Sex used to be so dirty and dangerous.  Oh, it was filthy.  It just smelled.  That's sex.  Remember when it was just dirty and dangerous?  Oh, yeah.  Where you would pull down panties and see just that? 
[00:37:30]  And go, where do I begin?  I don't even know where to start on that.  It's like you need a weaving loom.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Get the fuck out of here.  All right.  We'll discuss that after the break.  And what else, Ant?  There's so much.  I forgot.  Oh, yeah.  We've got some Jacktober.  Our friend Cowhead did a phone-in with Scott Weiland.  Oh, yeah?  And Weiland's trying to claim he's sober.  And wow, he doesn't sound sober in this interview.  And good for Cowhead.  He got an exclusive that everyone's talking about today. 
[00:38:00]  That's not part Jacktober.  No, it's not.  Okay.  I was confused.  I'm like, Sam, why are you bringing us Cowhead audio for Jacktober?  He seems to do a pretty good show.  Why don't we ever get an exclusive?  I was thinking of that.  I was thinking about that today because we had Jen Sturger on the show.  Yeah.  This would be the perfect show to go, guys.  I got something to tell you, man.  This Brett Favre has been trying to pick me up.  He's been hitting on me.  Why don't we ever get it?  I don't know. 
[00:38:30]  And a lot of these people, as soon as they leave our show,  they can't wait to talk to someone about what they got going on inside their heads.  We loosen them up.  You think?  Yeah.  But we never get the exclusive ever.  Cowhead got the exclusive on Scott Weiland.  Scott Weiland won't even talk to us.  One of these days.  We're a much bigger show, no offense, than Cowhead.  Cowhead.  So we got that and other Nuggets.  Nuggets.  And your dumb Yankees won again yesterday, so I guess we'll talk about that as well.  And hockey started and now I'm just babbling, so Travis just hit that stupid button. 
[00:39:00]  The Virus Series XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I nearly lost you there  And it's taken us somewhere  I nearly lost you there  Let's try to sleep now  Screaming Trees. 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  I suggest the song Dollar Bill.  By Screaming Trees.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's Lanigan, right?  I think so.  We talked to him years ago.  I was getting all, like, fucking pissed off at my TV.  Not FIO, so oh, no. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, no, don't think that.  But I decided Amazon.  You know, Amazon's got a service like Netflix does, right?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you could get movies, TV shows, all kinds of fun things.  And Netflix did not have the entire season of Louie.  Louie C.K.'s show.  But Amazon did.  So I'm like, I'm hanging out.  I'm up in my room.  I go through all my little things on my Sony Blu-ray player, which can get, like, Netflix and Amazon and all kinds of other fucking things. 
[00:40:30]  And it's so fucking complicated to get the Amazon thing to work on my TV through my Sony player.  You got to go to, like, Sony.com.  You got to go to Amazon.com.  You got to register the device.  And there's, like, a fucking code that's got to go in. 
[00:41:00]  And then it says device already registered instead of having a code.  It's like, all right, it's already registered.  Where's the fucking code that I put in?  I need the goddamn code.  That's fucked up.  So I was so frustrated.  I'm just all pissed.  I bought it.  And I'm like, just fucking, ah.  Netflix does the same thing with the codes.  But at least I've been able to find that, like, I could play Netflix on my TV.  I could do it.  They just didn't have Louie. 
[00:41:30]  So now I went to Amazon.  I figured it was going to be the same thing, just as easy.  And there's, like, some code.  Really?  And it takes five minutes.  It's easy.  I said Netflix is easy.  I'm saying that.  The Amazon part was complicated, right?  You got Louie on Netflix.  I would assume Louie would be on Netflix.  Or did you get it from Netflix?  Did they send you the fucking discs?  What did it?  Don't bullshit me, motherfucker.  I would assume it would be part of Netflix, no?  I look. 
[00:42:00]  I'm pretty sure it's Netflix has got to just, come on, just push.  Just get your shit together.  We're all ready for Netflix online.  I was all ready to fucking.  They're almost there.  Right?  They're almost there.  Louie.  Just Louie.  Usually Netflix doesn't have stuff that just air.  Like, you know, you can get an episode of something on, like, iTunes or whatever, like, next day.  But Netflix is typically.  See, look.  A little slower.  Louie, season one.  What does it say there?  It says save.  Yes.  What does that mean, save? 
[00:42:30]  Save.  It means you can't fucking get it right now.  Oh, really?  Don't bullshit me, motherfucker.  By the way.  What is that?  I'm bouncing you.  By the way, Louie's show is great.  How many episodes haven't you seen it?  Um, I probably haven't.  Yeah, I'm really behind.  Really?  I'm seeing them.  I've seen probably three episodes.  And I love it.  I, it's fucking hysterical funny, but I wanted to see them all.  And I'm like, uh, what am I?  Uh, you're up there in the Sierra Mountains, uh, drinking champagne cocktails, watching Louie. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, he had a great first season.  And he's going to do his second one now for FX.  It says it's not available on Amazon.  I bought it on Amazon, dummy.  Why are you yelling?  I got all this.  Because these people are stupid.  Why are you yelling, mommy?  He's stupid.  You're stupid.  Do I have to go find the blue comb?  And I could, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where,  Kurt Love, you're getting fucking, I swear you're getting bounced today.  You're getting a little rambunctious. 
[00:43:30]  Wow.  You're getting a little like you're part of the fucking show.  Wow.  You understand me?  I don't put up with this shit.  Kurt Love.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's just his fucking name.  No, I know who Kurt Love is.  He's ready to go, though.  You know what?  He's a gold member.  You can't, you can't block or ban gold members.  Here it goes.  Boom.  He needs a little lesson.  He's gone.  You can't do that to gold members of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Just fucking did I could do it to whoever the fuck I please.  That's a gold member.  Don't care.  He was annoying me.  He was fucking annoying me.  Well, isn't that how you become a gold member? 
[00:44:00]  Isn't that why anybody knows anybody's names?  Exactly.  Because they're so fucking obnoxious that you just know who they are now.  I think you're right.  I think we have to ban all gold members.  Because that's what happens with this show.  I know.  He was becoming entitled.  Right.  I've been having an argument with the text.  Let's get rid of all the entitled fucking listeners.  That would mean Kevin from Connecticut.  Steve from Bayshore has got to go.  Steve from Bayshore.  Uh, Marissa.  Uh, Marissa has to go now.  Pat from Minaki's, certainly entitled.  Fred from Brooklyn's, certainly entitled. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They all have to go now.  They all just got to go.  This fucking pig.  What does she want?  Lady Trucker.  Ew.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Talking around that ham sandwich in your mouth?  Good morning.  Hey, Dr. Steve Brownie B. Live October 16th at 7 p.m.  Anthony, I'm calling to apologize.  Uh, for what?  Well, I did eat government cheese when I was in the army, so I do apologize for the lines. 
[00:45:00]  I was having a little, uh, uh, Twitter back and forth with, uh, Lady Trucker last night.  Have you been here yet?  Um, during the, uh, no, no, it was during the Yankee game.  Yeah.  She was, like, all like, aha, ooh, look, the twins, uh, just, uh, got a home run.  Scores tied 2-2.  Yeah.  I was like, eh, relax, calm down.  Lady Trucker, no one likes you.  You really are not liked.  And I'll tell you why no one likes you on Twitter.  Because you try so hard to be, like, edgy and outrageous and shocking. 
[00:45:30]  Why don't you just be yourself?  I am myself.  No, you're not.  You're, you're, this is your fake persona.  I'm like, I'm, I'm, I'm a tough fucking edgy broad.  Stop.  I've seen you fucking tweet sunset pictures.  You're, you got a sensitive side.  Ugh.  Yes, I do have a sensitive side.  Exactly.  Exactly, see?  But later on Twitter.  Is that it?  Yes, that's her tweets later on. 
[00:46:00]  Just be yourself.  I think more people would like you.  Don't try so hard.  Really?  No, people still wouldn't like her, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Where are you today, Lady Trucker?  I'm in Florida.  What part?  Uh, down by, uh, Lakeland.  Are you near Orlando?  Uh, no, I'm on I-75 in Orlando.  Could, could a semi, uh, stop in front of my sister's house? 
[00:46:30]  She's got a few of my things.  I'll give you the address.  I want to, I want to fucking just bring it up.  Okay.  There's a tight turn to get into her neighborhood, but I think he can do it.  I want someone to pick up some shit from my sister's house for me.  Okay, uh, my next little side of the interview is through there.  I'll, I'll tweet you or something or call the show back.  And what is this Ronnie B, uh, Weird Medicine thing?  Hey, Weird Medicine's gonna be live on October 16th, and Ronnie B is, uh, guest posting. 
[00:47:00]  At what time?  7 p.m.  Really?  7 p.m.?  Fucking Dr. Steve didn't ask me?  Or Anthony?  He went right to Ronnie B, huh?  He, he knows we're not gonna fucking come here.  Well, he knows Anthony's gonna be seeing little Jimmy Norton up there at, uh.  All right.  That is true.  Boy, you sure know everything that's going on, don't you?  She sure does.  Another entitled person.  See, a nice phone call, but later.  Ah!  Tweets.  From Lady Trucker.  All right, Lady Trucker.  Enjoy Florida, will ya? 
[00:47:30]  All right.  You all have a good day.  Bye-bye.  All right, I-75 doesn't go through, uh, or 175, is it an I or a 1, Kevin from Connecticut,  doesn't go through Orlando?  Oh, who knows?  Whatever.  All right.  I unbounced, uh, Kurt.  Um, just, I wanted to teach him a little lesson.  Yeah, he's a gold member.  Be careful with the gold members.  Nah, well.  The gold members like to turn on ya.  I had a, I had a listener whisperer him.  Oh, really?  And, and, yeah, push his head down.  Push his head down.  That was the pal talk equivalent of fingers to the neck? 
[00:48:00]  Fingers to the neck.  I just, finger to the neck, put his head down to show who the alpha male is.  You blocked and claimed your space.  Of course I did.  Hey, very good.  I watch it.  He wasn't sure.  Kurt didn't realize who PAC leader was, and you had to show your assertiveness.  I had to show, and now look, he's gonna be fuckin' nice as punch.  Can I, no, no eye contact, no touch, no talk.  Can I, uh, can I brag about my shit real fast?  Oh, why not?  I made a new island today, which is, uh, which is a very rare occasion. 
[00:48:30]  What beach?  It was, it was in a turlet.  Oh, wow, you shit in a toilet, too?  It was in a turlet, and I made my own new island.  When was the last time you made an island?  It came out of the water?  You know how they make islands?  What is it, underground volcanoes or whatever?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then enough of that, enough of it comes above the surface water and makes an island,  right?  And it's an island.  I made an island today.  I was very proud of myself.  They're not just floating there.  They have to be fastened to the bottom.  I want to thank my brother and his fine, uh, buffalo chicken spring rolls. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh, is that what did it?  Oh, my God.  Those are tasty, though.  They are really tasty, but, man, the next morning, wow-wee.  Not in the California, uh, pizza kitchen.  Yeah.  That I went to last night.  That was a fine combo for, for this morning.  Allowing me to make an island, though.  Well, that's good.  That's a lot of shit.  Yeah, there was.  Or a shallow bowl.  Oh, yeah.  No, it was.  Yeah, it was your standard water level.  Uh, I think there was something else going on in the, in the toilet before I sat down. 
[00:49:30]  Ew, like what?  I don't know.  Have you been to these toilets?  I just take a leak.  Occasionally, I'll go in there and take a down pit.  You don't check before?  I do check, but sometimes you have choices.  Which, which clogged toilet am I going to add to?  This place is disgusting.  I would never be able to do that.  It really is disgusting.  Why?  I don't know.  I just, it freaks me out.  I don't know if there's a big mound in the ball.  No, no.  I won't even flush and use it.  I'll be like, that one's out.  That's a goner.  I get skeeved out. 
[00:50:00]  Like, I don't use the stupid little, you know, the toilet seat paper bullshit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's just, I don't want to feel like I'm at the doctor's office when I'm taking a shit.  You know what?  The wax paper.  It's like butcher paper for your ass.  But I'll wipe it off because people piss all over this.  I'm not going to sit and piss.  I know, slobs.  So, I mean, I get grossed out enough just, you know, cleaning the seat off.  Yeah.  I can't even imagine if there's a big duty in the ball.  Because if you get a splash back, you're fucking. . .  For the first time in my life, I had a shit like a girl, and it was one of the toilets here.  I've sat down on some nasty toilets because I'm like, what are you going to do? 
[00:50:30]  But there was a situation.  There's, what, four or five stalls, and they were all a disaster area where I had to fucking build a chick nest because I had to go.  And it was the first time in my life I built a chick nest.  You didn't just hover?  No, I can't do that because I got a bad back.  They kind of just do the catcher.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't do that anymore.  The catcher.  Too many years of caddy, and I got a problem with one of my fucking discs.  That bathroom's like the nom. 
[00:51:00]  It really is fucked.  But I had to build a nest for the first time.  Yeah.  Have you ever built a nest?  With the toilet paper?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they had the. . .  I don't even know what they're called.  They have the dispenser where it's the. . .  Yeah, yeah, the sanitary. . .  The paper toilet seat.  For your protection paper toilet.  Yeah.  The seat.  No, I've never built a nest.  I've cleaned the toilet with the soap and water on toilet paper or a paper towel.  Oh, sure, sure.  And I've done that.  Yeah, you've got to do house cleaning. 
[00:51:30]  Just to. . .  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's unbelievable.  And then dried it off and flushed 80 times and shit like that.  Can I. . .  Yeah.  Can I tell you, I haven't talked about my restaurant.  Silent partner, of course.  Brett does all the work.  Yes, yes.  And he's the real owner of FH Riley's.  Yes.  Went there yesterday.  And they had an incident.  An incident.  Place is fine.  Uh-oh.  No health code violations.  Nothing.  I don't like an incident, though.  All on the up and up.  But they were telling me a story that on a really busy Saturday night at FH Riley's. 
[00:52:00]  Ah.  Maybe he doesn't want me telling the story, but it's way too funny.  Yeah.  They had an incident.  We only have two bathrooms, right?  And in the girls' bathroom, which makes it worse, there was a doody on the floor.  Sorry.  A doody on the floor of a good girl's bathroom.  A doody on the floor.  That's a great picture.  Wow.  And one of the waitresses who's been there a long time, she's like a soldier. 
[00:52:30]  My brother Brett took the night off until he's at home or whatever.  And she took one for the team.  She had to go in there and pick up the doody off the floor in the women's bathroom.  How does that happen?  And here's a waitress just trying to make some money.  Yeah.  She goes into the bathroom going, I have to be the one that cleans up the doody off the floor.  She starts crying. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, no.  She was crying?  She starts crying, dry heaving, then starts puking, cleans up the doody.  And then like a soldier, after everything was back to normal, she went right back to waitressing.  I hope she warped.  But she was crying.  This doody brought her to tears.  Well, girls aren't like guys.  I don't know the detail of the doody, but it was a situation.  Girls aren't like guys who can walk in there and laugh.  No, another girl went in and there was a scream or something like that. 
[00:53:30]  A scream?  Or an oh my God, there was some kind of commotion.  Yeah.  And the waitress is like, wow, man, you know, we got to take care of this.  And it was just a duty on the floor.  And we were discussing, is it worse to see like that in the men's room or the women's room?  And we all agreed it's worse to see it in the women's room.  I don't know.  Because women just don't talk about their bathroom habits like guys do.  No. 
[00:54:00]  I'm trying to think.  I think men's room is disgusting.  But we've seen it in the men's room.  Regardless, yeah.  But you know those rare occasions when you go, you know what?  No one's looking.  I'm going into the women's room, right?  Yeah.  You go in really fast.  And if there was a duty on the floor, wouldn't you be more disturbed?  No.  Really?  Because I know I'm not using that bathroom.  We were in full agreement yesterday.  I know I'm not using that bathroom.  Right.  As I shove a frigging tissue up my nose. 
[00:54:30]  Well, it goes under the thing like guys are allowed to do gross things, but girls aren't.  It just boils down to that.  So when you hear a girl doing something gross, I don't know.  It affects you.  Like if I shit on the floor, it's funny.  If a girl does it, she's disgusting.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  So I think you would probably agree with me.  But I'm not going to use the fucking girls' room.  So the guys' room mess is the worst.  Like if someone goes, dude, there's shit in the ladies' room.  Check this out.  I'll swing the door open and look and just go, ah, ha, ha. 
[00:55:00]  If it's like, dude, look at what's left in the toilet here in the men's room.  I'd be like, oh, Jesus Christ.  But why would there be a duty on the floor of the women's room?  I don't know.  Maybe she got up.  They were hovering.  Yeah, they hover.  You think it was a hovering situation?  She didn't know.  Trust me.  We have a very clean restaurant.  A terrific menu.  Except for the shit all over the floor.  Not all over the floor.  Let's calm down a little bit.  Shit all over the floor.  You hear how I carefully told this story?  It wasn't all over the floor. 
[00:55:30]  Are you insane?  Yeah, shit all over the floor.  It was just great that the waitress telling the story said that she, it's a busy Friday  or Saturday night.  I think it was, I think it was a Saturday night.  And she said that it brought her to tears and she was puking.  Girls can't take it.  Like when she went to work that day, she didn't expect that she had to do this.  Yeah, it's probably not in the job description.  No, so.  Wow, what a slob, the fucking girl.  Yeah, I don't know.  And she says she knows who it was, too.  Really? 
[00:56:00]  So now I need her pointed out if she's a woman.  How does she know who it is?  Oh, did she, there was no duty on the floor and then duty?  Well, she said.  Duty, by the way.  I believe she said something like this one woman was in there for a long time.  So she obviously was having issues.  God damn.  Oh, man.  Why is this funny?  I don't know, but it is.  I'm way too old to be talking like this.  Like duty.  All right, why don't we go to Demi Moore's Snatch Pictures?  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Now, Danny is correct.  These pictures have been out there for a while, but our pals at www.tdd.com reposted them yesterday  and they were all the rage on Twitter.  I have seen these years ago.  But I got to say, it was shocking to see them again.  Her pubes go from like just below her belly button all the way down through her ass.  You can't even see like her asshole or nothing. 
[00:57:00]  It's amazing the amount of hair.  It was, I'll say it again, man.  Sex used to be a very dirty, dangerous thing, right?  And you can't even see like.  It was her, her, the labia or anything.  Remember, it was so intimidating when you're like, when you got to that part of it.  Once you got to that part.  You're like, I sure hope I know what I'm doing now.  Oh, Jesus.  Once those, like, once the hips came up, right? 
[00:57:30]  And you're like, oh, the panties are coming down.  Right.  And you pull the panties down and you got to that point.  Right.  Where you have the fucking giant hair.  That hair is a good one foot long.  Oh, yeah.  From where it starts on top by her belly and where it wraps around completely engulfing her anus.  Someone on Twitter, and I acknowledge him on Twitter, and I don't have their name in front of me now.  He goes, oh, that's why Bruce Willis is bald.  Oh, he saw that and just decided. 
[00:58:00]  Well, no, because he was down there, you know.  I'm shaving?  No, he was down there working it.  Oh, that's all his hair?  Either it's his hair or rubbed off his hair, too.  That really is like a toupee or a pelt.  Yeah.  It is.  How high off the body is it, would you say?  Two inches, maybe?  Like thickness?  Yeah.  That's a good plush.  Pushing two inches?  She has a plush pussy hair thing going on.  Oh, my God.  If that was a rug on your floor at home, you'd be happy.  Your feet would be really happy.  You'd take your shoes and socks off and just trot about. 
[00:58:30]  It's almost exactly Mr. T's mohawk.  Yeah.  Yeah, very good.  So it looks like, I guess back then, I'm trying to remember, like women did groom, but grooming  to them back then was just making sure it was off their thighs.  Right?  Yeah.  I was about to say, yeah, I guess as long as you shave the thighs, you're good.  In the 70s, which now I'm pretty much out.  That's general hospital to me more, by the way.  70s, I'm pretty much out as far as experience goes, but the women definitely had it going 
[00:59:00]  down their thighs as well, right?  Yep.  Definitely.  Definitely.  No.  The funny thing about these pictures that were reposted yesterday, a lot of the younger  guys that listen to our show on Twitter were like, there's no fucking way that's real.  They couldn't believe it was real.  Oh, they can't fathom what...  And I was thinking to myself, wow, are these guys showing their age on Twitter?  They're obviously not older guys.  What a big Harry Bush looks like.  Because they have no concept of what it used to be like.  What we had to deal with as men. 
[00:59:30]  Right.  Going in there.  Right.  Like you're on a safari.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it was like.  Safari.  Sometimes you had to open one up like a letter.  Yeah.  You needed a letter open to part the hair.  You needed to just get your finger in and just go...  Because the hairs would literally weave themselves together.  Like a Venus fly trap shutting the vagina off.  Oh, yeah.  And you would have to kind of get in there and part the hairs.  It was like an entrance to a cave.  You're in there with a comb parting it.  Yeah, like fucking... 
[01:00:00]  You had to give her a shimp hair.  You had to get up top and part it right down the middle.  Give her the alfalfa.  Yeah.  And you would get lost down there.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't know.  Believe it or not, guys.  If you can't find what the fuck you're supposed to be licking now when they're fucking shaved,  just jump off a bridge.  You got lost.  Because back then...  Yeah, you could get lost.  There could have been anything in there.  There was no defoliant.  Mm-mm.  Girls that...  Oh, I brought it up earlier. 
[01:00:30]  Girls that shaved back then were dangerous.  They really were.  When...  I mean, the word would get out, too.  Like...  Yep.  You hear what Molly did?  She has no pussy here.  She shaved it off.  She's fucking sick.  Yeah, you would think she was batshit crazy or something, right?  It was just something girls just did not do.  If a girl took...  If you took a girl's panties off and she had no pubes, it was like, oh, fuck.  Am I fucking a porn star?  Yeah.  Am I fucking some kind of a weirdo?  Oh, yeah.  What is this? 
[01:01:00]  Where's the hair?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, girls...  Girls used to take all that hair and...  There was one girl in Geneseo.  I don't know if it's true.  You know, but the rumor was that she shaved hers into a heart.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A little heart.  I really don't know if it's true, but that was the rumor going around Geneseo when I was  going there.  You know.  Probably.  I think girls first probably started just trying to shave it down a bit.  Right.  And shave it into shapes.  I remember when shapes were a big thing. 
[01:01:30]  But...  Just getting it off their thighs was a big thing.  A big thing.  I remember going to a pool party when I was...  I had to be 12 years old and shit.  My brother's like, yeah, it was a pool party.  Why don't you hang out?  So I went, and there was a girl wearing this crocheted bathing suit, and pubes were just...  Dude, pubes were sticking out of the side and actually coming through the crocheted  part like crazy.  And I had such a boner. 
[01:02:00]  And I was just looking.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it because I was seeing fucking pubes.  Crocheted bathing suit.  The crocheted bathing suit.  It was coming out like crazy.  That's great.  Like, I just wanted to get out.  Poking through.  But it was so exciting to me.  Pete, driving a car.  That's what it says on the Instant Feedback.  I'm only 35, but I remember when a completely shaved snatch was a treat.  A treat?  And I was torn between feeling strange for even looking at a bald, child-looking kumi.  But they don't look child-like. 
[01:02:30]  They got meat hanging.  Nah, the first time you saw it.  Now it's acceptable.  But I kind of understand what you're talking about.  First time you're like, wow.  I really get a detailed look at this thing.  You're like, is this legal?  That's amazing.  Is this legal?  I guess it's like when, you know, if you saw it, like a completely shaved dog.  Right, right.  You're like used to seeing it with hair, and you see it without hair, you're like, yeah,  it looks weird.  Uh-huh.  Or cat.  But to answer the question. 
[01:03:00]  Shaved cat.  Yeah, see?  That just looks silly.  Aw.  He looks like a little lion.  He's happy about that?  No.  He's miserable.  We're going to talk to some of the old-timers, Anthony.  We got Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris, go ahead, brother.  It's almost sad that the kids today don't even know what it's like to get cubic hair stuck in  their throat.  All that.  Trying to not sound like, you'd have to, and then putting your hand in your mouth and  just trying to dig hair out of your teeth and tongue and throat without looking like 
[01:03:30]  you're fucking, you know, being, you didn't want to be rude.  Oh, yeah.  Like, oh, sorry, is some hair getting, I have some hair.  I'm biting into a fucking, a goddamn beaver.  Yeah.  Literally.  And then when you think you've had it, six hours later, there's another one that creeps  up somewhere.  It was like, the worst thing you could ever try to do, the impossible mission was, I'll  just swallow it.  I'll just swallow this hair.  Which is almost impossible. 
[01:04:00]  Hair cannot be swallowed.  Cannot be swallowed.  Fire up voters.  What happened?  I don't know.  Robin Quivers is talking about Democrats and politics and voting.  Really?  On Fox right now live?  Is she a Democrat?  What do you think?  Of course she is.  And Jim Brewer's on, too?  What is going on?  What the hell is this?  Fox News has Brewer and Robin Quivers on talking politics.  What world are we in?  I don't know. 
[01:04:30]  Brewer is not a big politics guy, really.  Well, he probably, he probably has his concerns about what's going on.  By the way, get out and vote.  Yes.  On election day.  Get out there.  No, don't do that.  We need the Democrats in office.  And just vote Republican, please.  Let's end this fucking bullshit already.  No.  Please.  Because the bullshit won't end.  No, no, no.  Fuck the Democrats.  Just vote Republican.  Let's go Democrat.  Just go right down the line with Republican.  I know some of them are assholes.  A lot of them, whatever. 
[01:05:00]  You can't do that.  But this is bullshit.  Unemployment's fucking ridiculous.  And the taxes are just going to hurt more.  Hey, that tax you were telling me about two days ago, was that?  Yeah, the estate tax.  It's great.  Can you explain that to the people?  Because I was explaining it to my wife.  Yeah.  She couldn't believe it either.  It's crazy.  There has been a moratorium on estate taxes.  What's estate taxes?  When you die?  After you die, the government puts their hands in and takes their share. 
[01:05:30]  Right.  Now, everything you bought with the money that you had has already been taxed, that money.  Correct.  And when you bought it, you were taxed buying it.  Correct.  We've talked about that plenty of times.  And there hasn't been an estate tax.  Let's not forget, when you do put your money in a bank or invest, they're taking shit out, too.  They're taking taxes out whenever you make money on it.  So the government is getting their taste.  They are totally getting their taste.  Because the money you're saving is already only part of the money you actually made.  Right.  Because the government already took their percentage. 
[01:06:00]  They already took their shit.  That's why this is unbelievable.  Yep.  So now, after January, the estate tax comes back.  So if you make or own, if your estate is over a million dollars, which, believe it, it sounds like a lot, but it's a whole estate.  We're talking your house, your cars, your cash, everything you own.  There's a lot more people that have assets.  Not a million in the bank, but their assets equal a million dollars. 
[01:06:30]  Their estate, if they died and everything's tallied up, it goes over a million bucks.  You're talking a 55% government tax.  They will take 55% of your estate.  So you've got to sell everything, give the government half that shit, a little more, and then your family gets to bask and enjoy only half of what you accumulated.  Less than half. 
[01:07:00]  45%?  Yeah, yeah.  So are you saying, let's say, let me think this over, you have a $300,000 house, let's say.  Yeah.  I'm trying to like, you know, where you just make the million.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got maybe $100,000 in the bank.  Yeah.  Help me out here.  You've got stocks, you've got a retirement plan.  Okay.  A little 401 action.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe you've accumulated some collectibles in your house.  So you're telling me then the government, the guy dies, the government comes in and goes, well, we have figured out that he was worth over a million. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, there's an assessment done.  But obviously you don't have the 55% in liquid cash to pay the government.  So now you're selling his house just to give the government their taste?  You have to sell everything to pay the government their fucking tax.  So you can't really leave your house to family anymore.  No, no, no.  That's in a lot of cases.  Dude, that is old fucking shit.  Wow.  People don't do it anymore.  The tax burden is going to be crazy.  And it was part of the Bush era tax cuts. 
[01:08:00]  And it's something that, of course, the Obama administration is going to let expire.  You really got this figured out?  Yeah, I really don't want to pay.  No, I mean, this is exactly what's happening.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were talking to him.  I was sitting with our finance guy and talking with him about it.  And the taxes that are going to come up January 1st are insane.  You just made us sound like an alternative couple.  Oh.  Our finance guy, like we're kind of married or something. 
[01:08:30]  Oh.  Well, you know what was really embarrassing?  I'm with the finance guy.  And then he, we conference called a lawyer.  Right.  Because I'm getting all my, you know, shit in order.  Right.  Finally.  Right.  And he goes, well, Anthony and his partner do have some common assets.  And I'm like, could you fucking maybe tell the guy you mean radio employment partner?  Because earlier, earlier he brought up like, you know, well, if you decide to get married 
[01:09:00]  and have kids, I go, that ain't happening.  And then later on, my partner, I'm like, dude, could you explain to this guy?  I'm not sucking a dick.  And I'm fucking.  You did say our finance guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Like we might have taken a little trip to New Hampshire or something.  Yes, our finance guy is very angry with how you're spending money.  Oh, I did what I hate.  Sorry about that, guys.  No, I'm constantly.  The pounding of the console. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, but when they do it, they're laughing over nothing.  I know.  With me, it's legit.  But I just made the mistake and did exactly that.  So I'm no better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I would love to see that not expire.  Of course, Congress just ran out, especially the Democrats.  They ran the fuck out of there before the midterm elections.  They didn't want to vote on anything.  They don't want to talk about anything because they know that it would just put them deeper  in a hole.  Is this a state tax thing, something they could vote on, or is it just going into place?  Things can be put.  You could put another moratorium on state taxes and the Bush era tax cuts for the, as they 
[01:10:00]  say, wealthy, but it's the middle class.  Just please.  It's for small businesses.  Taxing small businesses is just going to be a disaster.  It has been a disaster.  Two years that Obama's been in and the rest of the Democrats have been in charge has just  been a disaster.  It's wrong about the estate tax.  See?  That's why I asked you if you had your facts together.  Go ahead.  Let me go to Jackie in Jersey.  Jackie, is Anthony wrong?  Oh, he's wrong! 
[01:10:30]  Oh, let me tell you about it!  How wrong is he?  He's so wrong!  Come on, Jackie!  Well, it sounds like the real Jackie doesn't even have an estate anymore.  He has to...  All right, don't try.  Just stop.  Go ahead.  Well, the estate tax you were talking about only goes to graduate a tax.  It's not 55% of the whole thing.  Yeah.  It's only over a million.  The first million is exempt from the estate tax. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, I said that.  I said anything over a million.  Oh, wait.  So you get to keep a mill.  Yeah, the first million you keep...  Oh, well, that's what I was explaining to you.  Oh.  I'm talking about the guys that are just making the mill.  So if you're just making the mill and you die...  You keep it all.  That's not that bad, Ed.  Oh, it's really bad.  Yeah, it is.  It's really bad.  All right, guys.  Have a good show tonight.  All right.  Oh, wait.  I know who that was.  That was Jackie who we invited in once.  Jackie!  Remember?  Donkeys! 
[01:11:30]  Really?  I'm positive.  Rain man.  Rain man when it comes to that shit.  Well, that's not as bad.  It still sucks, though.  Yeah.  I'm about the little guy.  The little guy just squeezing out being a millionaire.  There's no reason the government should fucking jump in...  Of course not.  ...if you've made something of yourself.  And they...  You know, take their shit.  You want to bring your family up.  But think of it this way, Ed.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  If the government's taking most of our money, right, then we don't have to worry about our  own family killing us to bring themselves up.  Well, that's true.  I'm always looking over my back when I'm at family functions.  Very suspicious sometimes.  You think someone's going to shank you at a picnic?  Well, you know, they're down on their luck a little bit.  Yeah?  If I'm out of the picture, they're thinking it's happy days are here again.  Do you think there's going to be, like, some kind of a free-for-all grab if you...  You know, God forbid something happens. 
[01:12:30]  Do you think your family is just going to be a fist fight for who grabs up shit?  Oh, probably.  That's why...  Really?  That's why I don't have anything.  Yeah.  That's why I don't have anything.  I want them all to just fight and try to figure it out.  Dude, get out?  Yeah.  You don't have a will?  Fuck ass.  No?  I don't give a shit.  Has our finance guy talked to you about that?  He tries to scare me into having a will.  I'm like, why would I care?  Well, you should care.  Why?  Well, because the government's going to take it all.  But I won't know that.  It's going to be a probate and all that bullshit. 
[01:13:00]  And it's just like...  Michu Kaku says we turn off like computers.  So who cares?  I won't know that.  Yeah, but...  What I don't know is not going to hurt me.  Well, I know.  But it's not about you.  Especially you.  And look at the point of view I'm taking and the point of view you're taking.  You're the one with the wife and kid.  And I'm the one that has nobody.  And I'm like, I think I should get this in order and set up some of this.  And try to figure that out.  You're just like, let him duke it out.  That's right.  That's right.  Fuck it. 
[01:13:30]  Fuck it.  Still figure it out.  Ha ha ha.  Ah, shit.  Look, man.  My dad left me nothing but bills.  I want to see the Hughes family brawl.  Nothing but bills.  Thanks, Dad.  Ugh.  Holy shit.  Still figuring out shit.  Really?  He's been gone six years.  Yes.  Still?  I don't even think he had $1,000 in the bank.  And they're still fucking sending all the kinds of letters?  Ah!  That's great.  And guess who they go after? 
[01:14:00]  The guy that's, you know.  You, you, you.  Doing okay for himself.  Yeah.  See, your niece and nephew should get it all, Anthony.  I set my niece and nephew up with some things.  Remember that?  I had, I had an insurance policy.  I needed an insurance policy for the ex-wife during the time I was paying her off, which  is crazy.  Which is like, I watch so many of those goddamn crime shows.  All I was thinking is, this settlement is completely setting me up to be murdered. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Like, it's obviously, I'm not accusing anyone of planning anything.  Never would.  Of course.  I have no proof of anything.  But all these shows I watch, if somebody is insured, and there's somebody that doesn't  really care for this person, but they're under the policy, they're always getting knocked  off.  I suggested you get one of those bomb mirrors, but you didn't listen to me.  Oh, under the car?  Yeah.  You should have been checking your vehicle.  The giant dental mirror that goes under the car?  Yeah.  Check for cavities while you're under there, too. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I gotta look for that shit.  Yeah.  That's scary.  Scary.  Yeah, that is true, right?  Yeah, you don't want people having a fucking, being a beneficiary on insurance policies that,  you know, don't like you.  And maybe I would be more open to some of this talk if our finance guy wasn't a ghoul.  I told you the story, and I'll say it again.  I'm sitting there with my new young wife.  This goes back, we were just wed.  Yeah.  So then he comes over thinking, well, now you gotta set some things up. 
[01:15:30]  Sure.  And then he actually says in front of her and me, he goes, well, you never know.  I mean, maybe you're driving home from Long Island, and you're in a fiery car crash, and  you're dead.  I know.  I'm like, why are you saying it that way, you asshole?  He stopped doing it because of us mentioning it on the show.  Somebody actually, it got back to him.  Oh, good.  And he goes, so I hear you were talking about me on the show.  And I'm like, yeah.  He loves talking about what could happen.  He goes, I'll try not to be so ghoulish. 
[01:16:00]  He's like, yeah, please.  Oh, and he jokes about it.  Really?  Don't be ghoulish.  It's terrible.  My girl was horrified.  And honestly, so was I.  I'm like, well, shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We're all gonna die.  But we don't want you coming up with ways of how it's gonna happen.  But then there's things like setting up medical proxies and financial, like, so that if you're  laying, let's say you're laying in fucking a hospital.  And no one has the right to pull the plug on you if you hadn't made that a stipulation. 
[01:16:30]  You'll just lay there in a vegetative state as your bank account just goes down and down  to zero.  And they finally just throw you in some kind of fucking home or whatever because you didn't  stipulate who should be your medical proxy.  Do you get the morphine drip?  I don't know.  As long as you can afford it, maybe.  If you got the morphine drip, then who would give a shit?  I want a morphine drip right now.  You know what kind of a trip you have at the end of your life if they're morphine dripping 
[01:17:00]  you as you're laying there?  Who wouldn't love that?  It's a fucking Pink Floyd.  Warm, fuzzy feeling all over you.  And just Pink Floyd fucking music.  Oh, and your bank account's just plummeting.  Yeah, who cares?  It's going down the turlet on a daily basis.  You feel like you're in the middle of a Pink Floyd concert.  Who cares?  You gotta stipulate.  You gotta have somebody say, all right, what are you gonna want to do?  Do you want someone to pull the plug on you or not?  Right now, in your life, what would you want? 
[01:17:30]  Pull the plug, keep you going.  For what?  You're fucking, you're brain dead.  Well, um...  I'm just saying, you're brain dead.  But I was changing the subject.  Oh.  I don't know your choice.  Like, you're brain dead.  Do you want to stay on respirators and machines to just keep your body going?  Oh, no, of course not.  Or do you just want the plug pulled?  No, we did that to my dad just because, you know, we felt like everyone had to see him 
[01:18:00]  one last time.  Well, yeah, yeah.  That's different.  But then he moved and showed that he might still know what was going on, which was weird.  And then the guy in the room said, we've never seen this before.  Oh, great.  So then it made me start thinking that maybe there's some spiritual shit that is out there.  That's what you want to hear.  He actually looked at my sister, and my sister swears, and the guy's like, this is impossible.  We're looking at his charts.  I don't know.  Wow.  Was there...  I swear to God. 
[01:18:30]  Have I ever talked about that?  No.  This guy swears.  He's like, this is my job.  I have to...  I'm the guy that sits in the room when these guys are brain dead.  And he goes, what I just saw should not happen.  Damn.  So what the fuck is that?  I'm not saying...  I don't know what the fuck that...  You know, I wasn't there.  But he goes, that is some weird shit.  Could be some reflex stuff.  Maybe.  Maybe.  But was there some kind of stipulation about...  Did he have some kind of thing that said...  Pull the plug?  It was up to us.  Oh, it was up to you guys, family. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It was up to us.  Yeah.  And we...  See, now...  I was in Boston, so for some reason they needed me to get there, and I'm like, just let  him go, man.  Let him go.  See, some family, though, might be like, not keep him going.  But I don't blame anyone, because they're...  I'm not even...  One of my brothers had to make the choice, and he made the proper choice at the time.  But, I mean, my thought was just let him go.  It's obvious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some people, though, they don't want the plug pulled, but then the family will be like,  well, he didn't write a winner in his will or anything, so kick that plug out. 
[01:19:30]  Medically, they just know that, you know, they're in a bad place, and if they do come  out of it, their lives are going to just be just a life they wouldn't probably not want  to live.  All right.  Or how about this now?  Because we also discussed this as far as finances go.  Yesterday?  The other day.  It wasn't yesterday.  See, that's why I don't return this guy's call.  I just don't return him.  Yeah.  No.  It was Tuesday, I believe.  Yeah.  How about this?  Did he give you the laundry list of everything that's wrong in his life? 
[01:20:00]  Because that's fun, too.  No.  No.  We're back on track with business.  Oh, God bless you.  Business as usual.  God bless you.  How about this?  You end up in the hospital, but it's not fatal, but you're incapacitated for a while.  Let's say you're in a coma.  You're in a coma, and you don't have a finance or medical proxy set up.  They could just take your money and pay, like, you know, do whatever they want, and your  bills might not get paid and shit like that, because no one has access to your shit, let's 
[01:20:30]  say.  And then you wake up, and now you're fine, but you realize because you didn't have anything  set up, you're fucking broke, or you lost your house because your mortgage didn't get  paid, or all kinds of other shit.  I got money buried in Mount Morris.  Oh, okay.  Then you're fine.  Yeah, I got money buried.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yeah, because I don't trust anybody.  All right.  You're good.  There is a map, though.  You got a treasure map?  There's a map in my safe.  It's in Mount Morris.  You got a safe?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I got a safe for the map.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  People think I went up to Geneseo for homecoming? 
[01:21:00]  No.  No?  I had to bury more money.  Bury more money?  This is where it's at, boys.  Oh, boy.  Go find it.  Yeah, that's tough fire.  That's why I'm trying to make jokes.  That's just ghoulish.  It is ghoulish.  And believe me, I don't like sitting there.  I'm the most heebie-jeebie guy ever.  So I don't like sitting there and having to deal with it.  I just love the you should care.  I'm like, no, I really shouldn't.  Yeah.  Who took care of me?  You know, people have died all around me. 
[01:21:30]  Did I get a taste?  Fuck no.  So now no one gets a taste.  But then he's also setting up the FU fund.  Oh, that's nice.  Which is good.  It means you're not just pulling cash out until it runs out.  Right.  It's a way to keep, you know, making income.  Wow, you're way more ahead than me, huh?  Make income so that you keep your money.  Right.  You keep your retirement stuff building.  Right.  But you can pull out and pay your bills and live your lifestyle. 
[01:22:00]  Wow, you're ahead of me.  So I'm setting all this up.  I'm getting all my ducks in order.  So in two years, blow me!  Yeah, I don't think I'll be here in two years.  Really?  The radio show.  So you should set things up.  No, the radio show.  Oh, I thought maybe there was a problem and I hadn't set up a will yet.  I think, I think, I don't know.  I don't think, I don't think so.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Maybe, I don't know.  All right.  Start negotiating now.  No, I'm trying to keep, I'm going to shut up right now. 
[01:22:30]  I'll try to keep it positive.  Keep it positively positive.  Why is this guy mad?  Greg in New England.  Greg, what's wrong?  Greg!  Howdy, howdy.  Hey, brother.  God damn it, man.  You're lucky enough to have all that cash.  Sure, you worked your ass off for it.  Nobody takes that away from you, but man, do the right thing.  Jeez, if I had one monthly paycheck from you, it'd solve every problem I ever had.  No, it wouldn't.  No.  By the way.  No, I was happier when I had no money. 
[01:23:00]  Huh?  Money's cool.  Don't get me wrong, but I was just as happy when I was poor.  No, no, I understand that.  I was poor most of my life, by the way.  If you have a crash tomorrow, you got to take care of that little kid and a wife.  He's taken care of.  He's got my fucking DNA.  Oh, shit.  All right, you guys are cool.  Appreciate it.  See ya.  Wow, is that obnoxious? 
[01:23:30]  Everything's coming up.  Ha ha, he's fucked, LOL.  Oh, is that really obnoxious?  All right, why don't we take a break, Ant?  All righty.  We got some guests.  God, we do.  We got Joe DeRosa coming in.  We got Colin King coming in.  We got Seth Green coming in.  Yeah.  We got Cowhead talking to Scott Weiland, and he sounds not sober.  We got Jocktober.  And what's cool about Jocktober, a little twist.  Sam has put together for this Friday, Jocktober Friday special. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Should I say what it is?  We're not looking at one show today.  Deez it.  All right.  But I think you're going to enjoy it.  I can't wait.  And it's based on something we did yesterday with Jocktober.  That's all I'll say.  Nice.  And we also have audio of Anthony hitting on Jennifer Sturger, who's the girl that Brett  Favre was doing his thing with.  Nice.  Whatever that thing was.  It looks like he didn't get too far with her.  But she was on our show, and Anthony was trying as well.  You didn't send a cock pic, though, huh?  No, never sent her a cock pic. 
[01:24:30]  Were you thinking of sending her the cock pic?  If she would have been a little more responsive here in studio, I might have, you know, after  a few texts, you know, sent the cock pic.  All right, well, we have that audio, which is going to set up another bit, because we're  starting to do bits on the show again.  Yeah.  All the times you awkwardly hit on a female guest.  Mm-hmm.  And we've been just going through names.  The list is...  It's been a few times.  Well, now we're closing in on 20. 
[01:25:00]  No way!  We're closing in on 20.  What a dick!  The list is going around here now.  And we thought it was fun when it was six or eight, and now well over 10, pushing 20.  Wow.  And E-Rock is trying to get it all together, so I guess we'll do that sometime next week.  That's beautiful.  I didn't realize it was that many.  Closing in on 20.  Fuck, am I a pig?  All right.  Is Ope blowing his future?  Shut up, Lydia. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, Lydia.  No, we don't have time to go to Lydia right now.  You shrink, you psychobabble.  Yeah, exactly.  The virus.  Sirius.  Sirius X.  You're listening to Ope and Anthony.  Ope and Anthony.  It's a big machine.  It's a big machine.  It's a big machine.  It's a big machine.  It's a big machine.  It's a big machine. 
[01:26:00]  I'm tied up to a big machine.  I got houses, got cars, got a wife.  I got kids, got me in the van.  Ope and Anthony, Friday.  Joe DeRosa in studio.  Yo, dude.  And also Colin Kane in studio.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Good, good.  You know, knocking around, just trying to get through the day. 
[01:26:30]  I'm trying to be a regular guy.  I like regular guys.  Another day, another dollar, you know?  That's what I say, you know.  Hey, TGIF, though, right?  Yeah, you know.  Hey, I think it's about beer 30, right, fellas?  Hey, look at my watch.  Hey, it's afternoon somewhere.  You got to throw in the you know a lot.  You know a lot.  If you want to be a regular guy.  You know a lot.  You know a lot.  I hate regular guys.  You guys want to come watch the game on Sunday? 
[01:27:00]  I'm there.  Yeah.  I got to ditch the old lady.  Bring her along.  Mare will make some dip.  I don't know.  You can come over my place.  I got the man cave set up.  You know, she don't go down there.  She knows better.  Oh, really?  What a man.  You had to set up your own little fucking space.  She gets the whole house.  You get a stinky basement room with a TV in it so your buddies can hang out.  That's what it is.  God forbid you hang out with girls. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  I got a man cave.  Really?  Congratulations.  You have a tree house at 45, you fucking loser.  It's tree fort.  Man caves are popular, though.  You're pissing off a lot of our audience, Joe.  Stop it.  We're trying to lift everybody up.  Just call it a room.  You got a room.  But it's just...  I got a bar in my basement.  I don't call it the man cave.  Right, exactly.  It's disgusting.  It's because you live alone.  That's true. 
[01:28:00]  It's just the cave.  You think there's a lot...  No gender.  You think a lot of the women will say stuff like,  well, all right, well, you guys have fun down there.  Have fun down there.  That matronly, motherly thing that they're just like,  all right, the guys are down in the man cave again.  She's talking to her friends upstairs, running the house.  Baking cookies upstairs for the men.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know how they are.  Oh, God.  And then she yells downstairs for the husband or something. 
[01:28:30]  Bob, could you come up for a minute?  She's calling.  The old ball and chain needs me.  You want to get me a cold one on your way back?  Get me a cold, frosty, wobbly pop on your way back.  I better go upstairs.  I don't want to be in the dog house.  I was over...  When Burstall lived in the city, I went to his house one day.  We were hanging out.  He lived with his girl, you know?  Yeah.  And every time she said something, he would go,  Oh, jeez, dear, you dingbat. 
[01:29:00]  And he kept doing it.  So then I started doing it with him.  And she's going, Stop it!  Stop saying!  Like, she was getting so mad.  Oh, that's classic.  Yeah, then two hours later, she's going,  Shut up, you dingbat.  We're like, yeah, it's funny.  See?  Hey?  Hey?  Hey?  Hey?  Shut up, dear, you.  You dingbat.  We got a Jew moved in next door there.  You dingbat. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, shit, that's great.  Man caves.  It's just so...  You know, be a guy.  I mean...  Sit in your fucking living room.  You can have a cool space,  but when you start talking about, you know,  naming it the man cave.  And when you're using it to escape from your chick  because, you know, the guys are over and...  Unless you're fucking...  Unless you're fucking down there.  Yeah.  But they fucking sell all that merchandise  specifically for that shit,  like those cabirators and all that shit. 
[01:30:00]  It's specifically for those types of little rooms.  Yeah, just for the...  Yeah, gotta get one of them.  Hey.  That's how it is.  Hey, man, look.  We sell beer signs.  You want to buy one for your cave?  I got the Coors one.  You turn it on, look, it looks like the waterfall.  Oh, man.  The waterfall's all lit up, and it's great.  You want a neon rolling rock sign?  Yeah, it's neon.  Oh, guys, we're pissing off...  And I got an old Schaefer.  I got an old Schaefer tray.  We're pissing off...  Pilsner glasses. 
[01:30:30]  We're pissing off Howard on Long Island.  What?  Howard.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Well, we need the man cave, bro.  We totally need it.  See?  And it's bro.  I know.  We need the man cave, bro.  What do you need it for?  Yeah, go ahead.  Sorry.  We need it.  Listen to me.  We need privacy.  When you got five TVs in the house and four of them have the fucking soap net on.  Soap net?  Well, be a man.  Be a man and change the fucking channel.  Whose wife has the soap net on?  This is what you do. 
[01:31:00]  Howard.  Howard.  This is what you do.  The next time she's watching soap net, you take out your cock, and you walk up to the  TV and start rubbing your dick all over the TV, and you go, oh, my God.  Wow.  All right, Danny.  Come on.  Danny found a picture of a guy gaping.  He's just holding his raw asshole open, and it's about the size of a beer can.  It's all over.  And then he puts man cave with an arrow.  I was gagging.  That's ass.  You see that open ass?  It looks like, remember the old school Twizzler commercials with the red lips? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  I like that.  Look at it.  It does.  You remember those commercials?  That's exactly what it is.  Twizzler's mouth.  All right.  Howard needs his man cave.  I'm sorry, Howard.  Aw, poor guy.  It's okay, but it's great.  It's great.  You guys are great.  What do you got?  What do you got in it?  Do you got a Peel's sign?  I got a 65-inch TV with the freaking Bows Home Theater.  I got it rocking and rolling down there.  I think what we're pointing out, I mean, is your lady allowed down there?  Yeah, yeah.  Or is this area off limits? 
[01:32:00]  No, no, no, no.  She comes down soap net's not permitted on down there.  Not permitted.  Oh, I see.  There's a space.  There's a room you can have.  But to dub it the man cave and, like, guys come over and say, yeah, it's good daddy to  me.  That's so, like, homoerotic.  It really is kind of gay-ish.  And also, I'm not trying to pick on Howard, but to say things like, it's not permitted.  There are rules and regulations to my clubhouse.  That's his clubhouse. 
[01:32:30]  And hard rules don't apply down here.  We're married upstairs and you're the wife and you can tell me some shit.  Not down here in the man cave.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  We got to shut up because so many people are going, this is hitting way too close to  home.  Fuck you, man.  I'm sorry, man.  Be a man.  I'm sorry, man.  You can act like a man.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  I don't know.  Godfather, I had to go to my man cave.  I tried to be there.  Mike, I'm out of with you. 
[01:33:00]  Godfather, just smack your face.  Had you invited me over for coffee, you would have a man cave on this day.  Did you ever invite me to your man cave?  These men took my daughter down to the man cave.  And did an unspeakable day, but she kept her honor.  I want you to destroy the man cave.  This I cannot do.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[01:33:30]  Immediately, that guy, bro.  Yeah.  Yo, bro.  Hey, you need the man cave, bro.  And then he goes.  Four to five TVs.  Yeah.  And then he goes, he goes, trust me, babe.  I got it rocking and rolling down there.  I got the TV.  I got the cake.  I'm rocking and rolling.  The last place I want to be.  I got the TV, too.  He had to say the size.  He got the 65 inch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The last place I want to be is Howard's man cave.  Yeah.  I never want to go anywhere that's rocking and rolling.  Yeah, rocking and rolling. 
[01:34:00]  I'm just going to sit and fucking maybe watch the game without it being a thing.  Yeah, look where we are, guys.  High fives all around.  High five.  A lot of high fiving going on there.  Yeah.  You want to come over here?  It's rocking and rolling.  Oh, what?  You mean a place where there's not going to be anything even remotely rock and roll?  Yeah.  Anytime somebody says that, it's like, it's so Dick Clark.  Ugh.  Awful.  Rocking and rolling.  No girls allowed.  He-Man Women Haters Club. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, great.  Yeah, well.  Danny's been punching up lots of man cave pictures.  It's a very popular thing out there.  Yeah, but could you just call it a room?  I understand.  It's my fucking, yeah, it's the TV room.  It's where I go fucking hang out.  It's whatever.  Unbelievable.  Dude, my buddy, my buddy got his basement completely redone.  Yeah.  But like, he's not a douche about it.  But we go down there and get whacked.  He doesn't care if his wife hangs out or not. 
[01:35:00]  And she goes to bed early because she's a nurse.  Yeah.  And she'll, it's the funniest thing.  We stand there and we get shit-faced.  And she'll come down at like 3 a.m. with this look on her face like, can you lower the music, please?  And he'll go, yeah, you want me to lower?  Hold on a second.  And he walks into the stereo and turns it up louder.  I'm an asshole.  And then she gets mad and he'll literally start going, who's castle?  My castle.  I own the whole cat.  Dude, it's the shitty, like, but it's funny.  He's doing it just to be a douche. 
[01:35:30]  And we laugh so fucking hard at her and she gets so fucking mad.  That's.  See, that's funny.  It's hilarious.  That's a guy that's like, fuck you.  Not like, all right, let's go down to the place where I'm in charge.  Yeah, she takes care of all this upstairs shit.  You know, all the other shit I paid for.  Dude, it literally is like a fort.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a tree fort.  I'm so glad you brought up the fort thing because Michael in North Carolina is going to bring  this whole thing.  The man cave.  He's going to bring this whole thing together with one lousy phone call. 
[01:36:00]  Go ahead, Michael.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, I grew up in Tennessee and, you know, middle school, high school, we all had a cave  out in the woods that we used to hang out, you know, looking for and, you know,  burnt stuff, whatever.  And, you know, so I went back home a couple of years ago, read a story in the newspaper  that a bunch of married guys had gotten busted having homosexual sex in something called the man cave.  See, basically, all our tree... 
[01:36:30]  The man cave is ruined for life for me now.  Every time I can't think, I can't hear a man cave and not think about, you know, 40 guys  for the...  Yeah.  Basically, our old tree forts and all that are now places where guys go to have gay sex.  Yeah.  When we were growing up, it was cool.  It was our tree...  Who would be ripping me off?  It was our tree fort.  I actually...  Actually, growing up, everyone has...  Thank you, sir.  When I was growing up, I used to have...  Across the street from my house, it used to be a huge, like, mansion in this huge woods,  and I used to go in there and just fuck around.  And I got pornos, and I didn't want them to, like, get fucked up, so I put them in Ziploc 
[01:37:00]  bags and I buried them.  Wow.  Very, very squirrel-like.  I want to start...  Joe likes that one.  That's the best to bury them.  We never buried them.  We kept them in the tree fort, and they'd always wind up getting...  You know, like...  As kids, we could build a tree fort, but we weren't very good roofers, so they leaked.  Right.  You know, it's not like you had this nice roof on there.  So the porno would always end up like a rollercoaster track.  Yeah, right.  All like that, and the pages would, you know, be stuck together.  Between the rainwater and all the cum. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, God.  Your Playboy would be ruined.  Yeah, which was saltier, the rainwater or the cum?  Oh, no.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  You came on my favorite picture.  Why would you do that?  It was also like fucking Lord of the Flies back then, because you'd go up into your tree  fort to go look at some of your porno stash, and it's like, it's gone.  I bet the motherfuckers that Warner Road took it.  It was fast. 
[01:38:00]  And like, they had the fort, and then you had to go for a counterattack to get your porno  back.  Fucking crazy.  That's the thing with the gay sex thing, Ope, that you said, or the guy that called,  whatever, saying the guys were fucking in the man cave.  That's literally what I picture every time in a man cave, is that scene from Autofocus  where they're both sitting there, and they're like, this is making me hot, and they're whacking  off next to each other.  Do you remember that?  Goddamn.  That's not right.  Do you remember that in Autofocus?  What movie was that?  I never saw that.  That's the movie with Greg Kinnear where he plays the guy from Hogan's Heroes. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, you know what?  I don't think I ever saw that movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're sex freaks, and there's a scene with him and Willem Dafoe, and they hang out  in Greg Kinnear's basement, because they got fucking tapes of them fucking on the road  and shit, and they're watching a tape of them banging these chicks in Dallas somewhere,  and Willem, what's his face?  Greg Kinnear just goes, this is making me hot, and he starts fucking jerking off, and  Willem Dafoe starts jerking off, because they're that desensitized.  That's what I picture in the fucking man cave. 
[01:39:00]  Man cave, just jacking off.  There's no fucking pussy around.  Porno on Howard's 65-inch TV, his cock is out, his pals are around, they're eating hot  wings.  Hey, man, it is halftime.  I mean, what are you supposed to do?  What are you supposed to do, right?  Come on.  We watched the whole game, I don't need to look at the highlights.  Oh, shit.  Some people say man caves are homoerotic, and other people say, come on, man, lay off,  dude.  I got a man cave.  I got a man cave.  That guy's married, that's why.  Shut it with your gay room. 
[01:39:30]  You have a gay room?  You have a gay room?  You have a gay room.  That's what it's for.  It's for putting your penis in another man's ass.  We just lost our demo, man.  What's wrong with you?  Fuck our dumb-o.  I hate our dumb-o.  You go to the contractor, can I have a man cave?  Oh, you want a gay room?  What do you need?  I'll go to the gay room.  Yeah, it's fine.  I got the gay room catalog right here, and you can pick out your gay.  Yeah, we're just calling gay rooms now. 
[01:40:00]  That's right.  Man caves, yeah, that's like last year.  Now we just call them fag rooms, gay rooms.  Yeah, you want a cum basement?  I can build that.  Yeah, what do you need?  Yeah, that's all right, bro.  You want a drain in the floor, on the tile, in a squeegee?  What do you need?  What do you need?  You can hose it down.  No carpeting.  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ.  Whatever.  All right, here we go.  I'm going to make it sound cool.  Let's talk to the women.  Denise in PA.  Denise. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hi.  So my married boyfriend has a man cave, and that's where he calls me from until all hours  after his wife goes to bed, and we talk until all hours.  That's what he does with his man cave.  Oh, well, you sure showed us.  Slut.  Are you trying to prove that he's not gay because he calls you and talks to you until early hours?  That's more gay.  If he fucked you in his man cave, I'd be like, all right, you got a point. 
[01:41:00]  Is he talking about what kind of curtains to put in his man cave with you?  Stop it.  Yeah.  I'll bring it up tonight.  You should be ashamed of yourself, adulterous.  I want everyone to know there's a whore living in Pennsylvania.  There's a whore calling the man cave.  Get your own man cave.  Get your own goddamn man.  Janice Ross, he's a man cave whore.  You're awesome.  All right, Denise.  Janice Ross. 
[01:41:30]  Let's say goodbye to the slut from Pennsylvania.  And look what happens when you press the button.  The wall opens up, and there's a 65-inch television.  Oh, God, was she a gaudy, dumb bitch?  She was the worst.  Now guys are calling to admit they have a man cave, and they have names for their man cave.  We start with Vic in New York.  Vic.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, bro?  Hey, what's up, man?  I call my man cave a fortress of solitude. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  From the Superman thing, fortress of solitude.  I got my wife and four little cunts at home, man.  All right, you know.  All right.  He deserves the man cave.  In all fairness, Anthony, there is another side to this.  He has a fallout shelter, then.  Four little cunts.  That's a bomb shelter.  Jesus Christ.  Four little cunts.  All right, you know what?  That was awesome.  Oh, damn.  He just defended everybody with a man cave out there.  All right. 
[01:42:30]  Justin and Westchester.  Justin.  Hey, man.  Yeah, was that a man cave in Pulp Fiction?  Yeah, under the pawn shop.  Right.  That's hilarious.  Fucking Zed used to go down to the man cave.  All right, you know what?  Now, let's go to my man cave.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  You know, we're fighting this out in front of everybody.  Yeah, we're in the man cave.  Yeah, let's go.  Yeah, fuck him. 
[01:43:00]  Fuck him good.  Who is sick or Zed from fucking the guy?  Or the guy standing there going, yeah, fuck him.  That guy.  The other guy.  That guy.  The other guy's sick.  That guy creeps me out.  The man cave.  Yeah, yeah.  Call your mistress.  Talk to her at all hours of the morning.  Yeah, go ahead.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking do it.  You turn on that 65-inch TV, Howard.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  No soap.  Fuck him.  No soap net permitted down here.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, tell the gimp to go upstairs and talk to the wife. 
[01:43:30]  Man cave back to the gay room now.  It's all gay.  We're battling this out in front of everybody.  How could you not listen to this and just see Marcellus Wallace getting fucked in the ass?  One of the, yeah.  Sexy.  That was a tough, tough to stomach, man.  Tough to stomach the first time I saw that flick.  Like on the slide away, he's like, oh my God.  What happened to that guy?  Who's that?  Marcellus Wallace.  Oh.  Ving Rhames.  That guy was the man for like three years. 
[01:44:00]  He was in here like about a month ago.  About a month ago we interviewed him.  Is he awesome?  Yeah, he was pretty cool.  He is pretty cool, but his whole chest is carved up.  You don't fuck with a guy like that.  He was in Piranha.  Yeah, he was in that movie, Piranha.  That was a great man.  Which ended up being a better movie than I thought it was going to be.  Because it was a goof, I guess?  Yeah, they were goofing and it was supposed to be campy and all that shit, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It was fucking great.  But yeah, he had a nasty fucking carved up chest.  From what?  Was he in jail or some shit? 
[01:44:30]  Then he got like cut up and stabbed and shit back growing up in the hood.  We got that scorn.  It looked like some kind of keloid scorn.  You ever see it?  I don't have any idea.  It's been in movies, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But then I think people thought it was just makeup.  But no, it's part of him.  Part of who he is.  Oh, yeah.  Let me...  The remake of Dawn of the Dead was great, too.  That was fucking fantastic, man.  That was such a good movie.  But I guess what I'm saying is that guy seemed like he was on his way to being like an Oscar  kind of actor.  He was in that John Singleton movie about... 
[01:45:00]  What was that called?  The one where he was like the cowboy in it?  Ain't ringing a bell.  What the fuck?  The fuck?  Can we talk about Man Cave some more?  Sorry.  There you go.  That's good.  Oh, there's the scars.  Bing Rames.  Look at there.  In a man cave right there.  Yeah, that's real.  That's real.  That wasn't makeup for the film.  We saw it.  Mission Impossible, he was in that, right?  He got carved the fuck up.  Jeez, dear.  My man cave, huh?  We got a good question coming in from John in Jersey. 
[01:45:30]  John?  Hey there, Jan.  Hey, guys.  Do you think there's an equivalent of a man cave for stink boxes?  Stink boxes?  It's called the rest of your house.  Yeah.  It's called a stink box.  They call it the stink box?  Oh, we're just going down to the stink box.  Stink house?  They suck.  Do you think there are posters of the bridges of Madison County hanging all over there?  Yeah, it's all chick flicks, you know, traveling pants.  You're allowing him to say that without beating him up? 
[01:46:00]  No, because that's probably what it would be like.  Really?  Yeah, just awful.  Yeah, what do you think?  It would be that scene that's in every bad movie, like five or six women with some soul  music, and they got wine, and they're dancing together.  Yeah.  That scene, like, with Stella got a groove back or whatever the fuck, and they're all chatting  and talking about how men suck, and they drink the wine, they get a little, like, buzz, and  someone puts on some fucking Marvin Gaye, and they're dancing around to it.  Uh-huh.  I will never watch a movie where that happens. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  And then one of them goes, look at the picture of Brett Favre's dick that he sent me.  It's so little.  Yeah.  Oh, let's want to stay into that.  What do you think of that story?  No, I wasn't trying to...  But that's fine.  But, yeah.  What do you think about that whole thing?  Come on, give me a fucking break with this chick saying that she didn't send the...  Who the fuck sent the text, the MySpace messages, and the pictures if she didn't do it?  Who did it?  Right.  That's fucking ridiculous, and I'm just...  She had gold.  She's sort of, sort of famous, sort of, and she knows this pushes her forward. 
[01:47:00]  I'm with you, Joe.  Yeah.  Here's my point.  I'm with you.  Here's my point.  She's got text messages and a possible picture of Brett Favre's penis.  She needs to get that out there without making herself...  Maybe Brett was an asshole.  I am so sick of this shit.  I'm so sick of these fucking chicks coming out.  When Tiger Woods got busted, my buddy goes, my buddy goes, oh, thank God we have all these  upstanding whores that are willing to come out and talk about this.  I'm so sick of these chicks.  They show their fucking tail any chance they get, and then they fucking roll over. 
[01:47:30]  They burn these guys.  They ruin fucking lives.  They don't give a shit.  And you know what I'm really...  What fucking bothers me about?  You will never...  It's not you.  Well, that.  And you will never turn on Oprah and see this.  You will never turn on Oprah and see a woman sitting on the couch and hear the woman go, well,  Oprah, you know, we just had the idea to start the computer company in our dorm room, and  now we're billionaires.  You will never fucking see that.  Well, it's a social website that we invented, and now we're billion...  You will never fucking see it. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  I am so fucking tired of guys getting fucking run through the mud by these chicks, and it's  a free fucking ride.  Yeah.  Take your fucking pick.  Either we're equal sexes or we're not.  Take your fucking pick.  Stop running us through the fucking mud.  Stop taking every chance you got to suck a guy's bank account dry.  To suck a guy's bank account dry.  It's fucking pathetic, man.  It's absolutely pathetic.  This fucking rag has her ass and tits all over the fucking internet, and it's going  to sit there and go, I don't get it. 
[01:48:30]  Why would he send me a picture of his dick?  It doesn't make any fucking sense to me.  Her tits are hanging out in, like, everywhere.  How many pictures?  Yeah, it was great.  It drives me fucking crazy, man.  It's ridiculous.  This fucking studio is like a man cave right now.  You're a fucking man cave.  Yeah, fuck the women.  You don't get out of here.  Yeah, what are you doing here?  Come on, DeRosa, pull your cock out.  Let's jerk off.  Come on, like a real man cave.  It's just making me hot.  How are they going to prove it's his dick? 
[01:49:00]  How are they going to prove it's his dick?  Is it going to go that far?  It just got traded again.  Oh!  Oh, no, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  I think they were, uh, he's not denying it, is, like, the first thing that says it's  his dick.  Secondly, I think somebody recognizes his hand or something.  He's really trying hard to cover it up.  And you got this fucking, now this big, dumb lug is going to have to go on TV and go, 
[01:49:30]  yeah, it was my dick, I'm sorry.  I want to apologize to my wife and my kids and my grandkid.  He has horrible game on the field and off the field, by the way.  We were playing the voicemails and his game is, it's uncomfortable to listen.  You want to play it again for everybody?  Yeah, yeah.  Listen to this because they're crazy.  They're quick.  Droning delivery.  We got audio of Anthony trying to pick up the same girl.  Yeah.  Well, she was in here.  She was in here one day. 
[01:50:00]  She was in here, like, promoting that she was doing this Who Gives a Shit sports show  for some Who Gives a Shit channel, knowing in her head that she had some real good stuff  to talk about.  That always drives me nuts.  From, like, 2008.  That always drives me nuts.  This supposedly happened in 2008.  It's just fucking, it's just...  Here's the voicemails that Brett left for Jen Sturger.  Jen.  Man.  It's not a setup.  Just got done in practice.  Got meetings here, and we're up for about a couple more hours. 
[01:50:30]  I'm going back to the hotel and just chill.  So, the mid-tech, because I'll be in the building for a couple hours.  I'd love to have you come over tonight.  But, I know, I think Aaron came up and asked you if you, you know, might be your number 
[01:51:00]  or he was going to give you my number.  But, I understand.  But, the mid-tech, love to see you tonight.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  That's like a teenager.  He's got all the personality.  I never leave voicemails.  I never fucking leave voicemails.  No, first of all, don't leave a voicemail.  Never.  What's wrong with you?  Just send a picture of your dick.  Just send a cop pic.  Send a cop pic.  Then, here's his delivery.  Uh, Jen.  Uh. 
[01:51:30]  We're, uh, passing through 10,000 feet.  Uh, you can start turning on your electronic devices.  Uh.  Yeah, but there's confidence in that voice.  You can start coming around with drinks, beverages, and, uh, food for you.  Chill out.  Chill out.  Enjoy the flight.  Uh, enjoy my cockpits.  That's right.  You're Brett Favre.  Yeah.  Just say, hey, man.  I'm going back to my hotel room, and I really want you to suck my dick.  Yeah.  Like, he's talking around it and being all awkward and weird.  Like, he's a pimple-fucking-faced kid or something. 
[01:52:00]  The subtext of that voicemail is just fucking bleeding.  You can hear him literally about to be like, yeah, so, uh, did you ever wonder what the  fucking point of all of it is, Jen?  He does sound like a broken man.  Yeah.  My career's falling apart.  I'm trying to rag you out.  You're probably going to go to the press.  That's done.  He knows what the fuck is going on.  Fuck it.  Fuck it all.  Yeah, but he gets whatever he wants as far as pussy, and then all of a sudden he's actually  got to work for it now, and he's got to talk.  And that's what's great about it. 
[01:52:30]  Like, he's always like, uh, now he's just talking, like, you know, so we'll chill, and  like, yeah, this girl wasn't running towards him going like, oh, Brett Favre, and he's  like, yeah.  So it's a little, that's, you get a little insight of that's how that is, I think.  I got to work at this.  I have no clue what I'm doing.  Exactly.  Nobody's run towards him since Cameron Diaz and something about Mary.  Look at his little dick.  That's his dick.  That's his dick.  Oh, shit.  Ah, Brett Favre.  He's got the top angle.  Oh, that's the most flattering shot, by the way. 
[01:53:00]  Is that erect?  That's flaccid, right?  Wow, dude.  Look at his head.  Look at that.  It's, uh, it's not good.  It's not.  Go back to the first one.  It's my favorite.  I love Brett Favre's dick.  Jesus.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, it's not.  Oh, what a mess.  Now we know why he wears number four.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, Jesus.  This looks very, very close to a first down.  Let's bring out Brett Favre's dick and see if, uh, they've made it. 
[01:53:30]  Brett, we don't have the guy to put his pinky on the ball for the kick.  Can you put your dick over here?  Brett Favre actually teeing up the ball for the kicker with that little dick.  Shouldn't get in the way at all.  Oh, Brett.  That is not good.  That's fucking sad, man.  A lot of people saying, come on, guys, his hands are huge. 
[01:54:00]  Cares.  You can kind of.  No, dude, look at it in relation to everything else.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Well, if your hands are huge, Brett, then why don't you take a picture of your cock next  to some watch batteries for a little perspective, you know?  Yeah.  Or a baby's hand.  I mean, if you're going to stand a cockpit, get it hard.  I mean, is that hard?  We don't know.  It looks like it's just about.  It looks like he's squeezing the bottom to try to blow it up like a balloon.  When you make balloon animals.  You think he's pulling down on it?  Yeah, he's trying his best.  Is that water? 
[01:54:30]  Give it a kind of a facelift.  I think it's a marble floor he's standing on.  Oh, I thought it was water.  It's like, yeah, dude, that's smart.  Put your dick next to the ocean.  Yeah, he's in some kind of a hotel room, so it looks like a marble floor.  It looks like the bathroom.  Probably living in luxury there.  Yeah.  Living in luxury, Joe.  Jeez, Brett, take a picture of your dick and send it to the broad, would you please?  Did he send that one?  How many did he have that that was the one he decided to send?  Like, how many other ones are really looking bad?  They finally said, no, this is the one I sent. 
[01:55:00]  By the way, you know how many I take before I send one?  I'm offended at the quality of his cell phone pictures.  Yeah, what does he got?  He's a multi-millionaire.  He's got a fucking Nokia flip phone.  These fucking pictures stink.  It's like half a pixel.  Muscle Tane has a fine little line here.  Does he have a purple helmet?  There you go.  See?  All right, here's another voicemail from him.  Embarrassing.  What's her name again?  Jen Sturger.  So, in some garbage can, huh? 
[01:55:30]  A little setup here.  So, he found out that she's not interested and possibly threw his number or whatever into  a garbage pail.  Okay.  So, this is where this picks up.  So, in some garbage can, huh?  So, that's what you think I think of you.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, I'm still trying.  Just got done with practice.  I'll try the other phone.  You can probably call her ID.  But you can make it.  It'd be great. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  Later.  He's trying.  I'm still trying, huh?  Yeah.  This is when he was with the Jets.  I have nothing else to say, though.  My team.  This is when he was with my team.  That is fucking pathetic.  It explains a lot now.  It explains everything now.  It explains everything.  So, and again, it says at the end of that article, hold on.  Let me read.  What does it say here?  It says, Sturger's manager, Phil Reese, told the Post, the almost too hot for TV hostess. 
[01:56:30]  And fuck you.  Almost too hot for TV.  What?  Are you fucking edgy?  They make her sound like Andy Kaufman or something.  Oh, she's so daring.  We don't know if we can box her.  It's fucking dumb.  She has to do a show up.  Yeah, exactly.  Read the fucking teleprompter.  Too hot for TV.  Fucking snap.  All right.  She's a fan of our show, but whatever.  Had no comment yesterday and denied she had provided the messages to the site.  Well, then who the fuck provided them?  Who provided them then?  How did we get to the point where we're playing her voicemails? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  How'd that happen?  That's what I'm saying.  So she had to give it to somebody?  That's what I'm saying.  Well, somebody, one of the...  And you would only give it to somebody if you kind of wanted this shit out there, right?  Well, dude, she's...  Oh.  No, no, no.  Brett needs...  You were setting something up.  Brett needs to take the Mel Gibson route on his voicemails.  He needs to take that Mel Gibson route.  I know.  Listen, you fucking cunt.  Yeah.  They should meet. 
[01:57:30]  Mel, you need a little more Brett.  Brett, you need a little more Mel.  And your voicemails.  And you guys will balance each other out nicely.  I can't believe I got to deal with this.  So many people saying tweet the link.  You can't find this?  It's on fucking YouTube, I'm sure.  It's everywhere.  Brett Favre's penis.  Please.  We'll tweet shit that's a little hard to find or whatever.  This is everywhere, man.  I'm just tired of this fucking...  Don't give me the baby in the woods routine, Sturger.  You know, she's fucking... 
[01:58:00]  Right.  I was watching Dracula yesterday after I left the show.  No, you weren't.  No, the Francis Ford Coppola one.  The one with Gary Oldman.  Oh, yeah.  I like that one.  But were you really watching it?  I took a nap.  I put it on when I was taking a nap.  You don't like that movie?  I like it.  I just questioned that you were actually watching it.  Oh, yeah.  It's that creepy Nosferatu looking Dracula.  Yeah, it's creepy.  But I put it on, and I was taking a nap to it, and I got so fucking mad before I fell  asleep.  I had to shut it off.  It made me so mad. 
[01:58:30]  Watching Winona Ryder be like, eh, and every fucking chick in that movie going, it's not  my fault.  He hypnotized me.  It's like, if that is not the fucking epitome of the woman's lack of responsibility in this  fucking culture, it wasn't my fault.  I didn't know what I was doing.  You were getting mad at a Dracula movie because she was being hypnotized by Dracula, and you  saw that as kind of a figurative thing on life in general?  Doesn't hypnotize any man.  No.  What's he doing?  He hypnotizes the chick, and the chick goes, he's got me this chance. 
[01:59:00]  And then fucking poor Van Helsing and this dumb snatch's fucking husband got to run in  and try to kill a fucking vampire.  I love it, though.  You're insane, but I love it.  You're insane, but I love it.  I'm fucking insane.  That's hysterical.  It's a very interesting...  I think because Dracula just wanted to fucking bite chicks.  He's not gay.  And we fucked up, by the way.  Yeah, a great man cave.  His man, Castle.  We fucked up. 
[01:59:30]  You know the garbage can comment that Brett Favre did in that last voicemail?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought it had something to do with maybe she threw his number away.  No, she didn't want to end up in a garbage can.  Yeah, exactly.  I fucked up because we got that part of the story earlier.  Because she basically said, you know, you get involved with someone like a Brett Favre,  you could end up in a garbage can.  So that's where the voicemail picks up where Brett Favre goes, garbage can, huh?  Oh, is that what you think I think of you?  Yeah, exactly.  We fucked that up a little bit.  You wouldn't want to hurt your status on the Versus Network. 
[02:00:00]  Listen, we've got to take a quick break.  We've got Seth Green here.  He only has until 9.  He's got a new project he wants to promote, especially on our show.  What the hell is he doing?  I don't know.  We'll find out next.  All right.  No, I do know, but that's the teasing.  Something called Control TV.  So, Seth, we'll talk about that.  We've got Colin King.  We've got Joe DeRosa.  We've got audio of Anthony attempting to pick up the same girl, Brett Favre.  Same girl, Brett Favre did, and with apparently the same results. 
[02:00:30]  Although I did not send a dick picture, which is probably where I made my big mistake.  I go straight to asshole picture.  Gay picture.  Do you just pull your ass over and send that?  Because if she's going to go for that, she'll go for anything.  Really?  You got her number?  Huh?  You got her number?  I don't think I ever got her number even that day.  Because I know one of your things is to hand over your phone.  Yeah, yeah.  I was going to flip on her phone.  I wonder if you got her number, because then maybe we could call her.  Get her a little exclusive here today.  Oh, really?  Let's get some real radio done. 
[02:01:00]  Leave her a voicemail or two?  Enough of this horse shit.  Hi, Jen.  Hi.  Cockpict is on the way.  I'm at the studio still.  Like I said before, I'll be out of here at 10 on the nose, regardless if we're talking  or not.  I'm still trying.  I'm still trying.  They're just a good old country boy.  You podunk asshole.  You fucking...  Yeah, but I've sent chicks pictures of my dick, so everyone's done it.  You've done it.  No, I haven't.  You've never done that in your whole life, dude?  No, because then I won't get to fuck them. 
[02:01:30]  I fucking totally have done that, dude.  Every guy's done that, man, for the most part, dude.  Everything with a chick, between me and a chick, is a trick to get her to the point  where I'm naked.  I've done it.  You have to work magic like Spangali.  Yeah.  It's all a trick to get to naked.  Once we're naked, I know she's probably not going to back out at that point.  But there's still a distinct possibility.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're not satisfied until you're in there.  I can't blame the girl.  I leave the door unlocked in case she wants to take a run. 
[02:02:00]  I'm like, yeah, I don't want her to feel trapped.  Grab her clothes and make a run for it.  Running down the highway trying to flag cars down like a rape victim.  Colin's done it, though, Colin.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I've done it.  Did you have proper lighting and angle?  What were you doing?  Fuck, man.  Yeah, just like he said, you've got to take a couple shots.  A lot of times you've got to get the chick to send it first.  The best is not.  You have her send it first, and then you just don't respond.  That's the best.  That's part of the worst thing you can do. 
[02:02:30]  You send her a bunch of proofs for her to pick out the one she wants.  No, during, yeah.  Do you want a wallet size?  My one friend, yeah, my one friend, Josh Accardo, he's a comedian.  He's very funny.  He's got such a manipulative power over women.  He can get any girl naked and send him pictures.  Every day I get a different picture.  You know, Josh.  I get a different picture.  Yeah.  Does he hypnotize him?  I don't know.  He seriously does.  He seriously does.  He'll hook up with a chick.  And seriously, he's got Invisalign.  You know, Invisalign.  He'll do a one night stand, and he'll somehow get that girl to pay for his Invisalign fucking 
[02:03:00]  installments.  Wow.  I'm into it.  How fucking nuts is that?  Fat chick, though?  Or has to be?  Nah.  Actually, I don't meet him, so I don't know.  Either fat chick or a chick with no father.  Come on.  I had a girl that lived.  That means like.  Let's be serious.  Let's be serious.  One of the two.  I had a girl that lived out of New York, and she started sending me pictures of like  her underwear and shit.  Underwear?  Ah.  Yeah, and I go.  You gotta end that relationship.  No.  She's sending me pictures in her underwear, I mean.  And I started.  I was like, hey, you know, feel free to send these pictures anytime once you know it's an  open door policy, whatever.  That's what you said? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  And she goes.  What the fuck, dude?  That's how you talk dirty?  Open door policy.  I was being funny.  Sounds like a job.  We've got an open door policy here.  Come on, dude.  That's so lame.  I was being funny.  I was going.  I was.  He signs it.  Yours, Joe DeRosa.  Very truly yours.  To whom it may concern.  We thank you for your interest.  Were you trying to hypnotize her, Joe?  No, I was being funny when I said it.  I was like, I just want you to know there's an open door policy in these pictures here.  You know, feel free.  That's hilarious, isn't it?  Wow.  She thought it was funny. 
[02:04:00]  Just like a fucking Woody Allen bitch.  Unbelievable.  If you guys let me finish, I'll.  I'll put that on the disc, man.  If you're finished, we can't make this much fun of you.  Wow.  Just like listening to Bill Hicks, Relentless.  Oh, wow.  Watch out.  I'm going to insult myself in the story if you let me get to it.  That's so much more fun for us to insult you.  I thought you already did.  You guys are cutting off the insult.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  So she goes, oh, so what are you going to send me? 
[02:04:30]  And she's like, you better send me some pictures.  And I go, what do you mean?  And she goes, if I'm sending you half-naked pictures, you've got to send me some naked pictures.  And I just go, neither of us want that.  We know this.  Neither.  I go, you're not going to enjoy it.  It's not going to be sexy.  I'll send you something else.  And then I told her she would acquire points for every time she sent me pictures.  Look at this fucking frequent flyer.  And she could cash the points in.  Cash the points in.  Fucking Joe DeRosa rules. 
[02:05:00]  And Brett Favre is laughing at you.  I have a catalog I'm going to send her.  Here's where you get my camel dollars.  We really got to break because Seth Green's got...  Remember that's a rewards program?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, it is.  We got to break, Ann, because Seth Green's only have a few minutes with us.  He's got to get out of here at 9, and we still have to break, so we're a little late.  Right, right.  So we'll continue with him.  And then, of course, Colin Cain and Joe DeRosa.  There's so much to do today.  We'll try to squeeze in as much as possible.  Sirius XM, the virus. 
[02:05:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  So busy today. 
[02:06:00]  In studio, Seth Green.  Seth, I got to apologize.  I didn't realize you don't have a lot of time.  It's outrageous.  And it's Friday, and we got way too much going on today.  Well, you know, whenever I fly into town, they try and maximize the amount of work that I do.  So I've got things scheduled like every 20 minutes.  Yeah, a few minutes here, and then you're off somewhere else.  What do you got, TV, too?  I got a bunch of stuff today.  We're trying to promote this project.  Yeah, what do you got going on?  I'm doing this crazy web experiment over the next six weeks called Control TV that's at ControlTV.com, 
[02:06:30]  and we got this guy, Tristan Kovaris, to volunteer.  We actually went through a rigorous selection process to find this guy, and now we've selected him.  He is under our surveillance 24 hours a day, and throughout the day, he has to make decisions,  whether it's like water or Gatorade, you know, and that vote gets put to the audience.  So everyone that's signed up to get alerts, you'll get an alert on your phone that says,  hey, Tristan needs your decision.  Is it oatmeal or cereal or is it a bran muffin? 
[02:07:00]  So this guy has to live his life based on what people that are like...  The whimsy of the collective, yes.  Is that him right now sleeping?  Yeah, that's him sleeping.  Let's wake him up.  We actually won't be able to wake him up, but later in the day, there will be a choice  as to how we should wake him up, and yesterday, he was woken up by a mariachi band.  All right, good, because that's what I was going to ask you, how edgy you get with this.  Because if it's oatmeal or Captain Crunch, it gives a crap.  Well, there's very simple decisions, and then there's really dramatic decisions.  So the simple things are like, you know, shoelaces or Velcro, and then the complicated decision 
[02:07:30]  is, do you date this girl or tell her to go F herself?  Okay, good.  Then you're doing it properly.  We're doing it properly.  Because some of these ideas sound good.  No, I'm serious, though.  Some of these ideas sound good, and then you hear how they're doing.  You're like, come on, don't pussy out.  But it's on the web?  Yeah.  So you can do a little more, right?  It's live all the time.  But you can get away with more, though, pushing it?  Well, I mean, we're pushing it to the degree that we want to help this guy in his life.  Like, we're not going to give him the option of walking on broken glass or anything like that.  Shooting himself. 
[02:08:00]  Should he shoot himself with an arrow or a handgun?  Pick up the phone or punch yourself in the face.  It's not.  I would totally fuck it.  I wish I'd fucking.  You would be the worst at it, dude.  Everybody would.  To tell you the truth, that's part of what makes this format so dangerous and why I keep  having these Oppenheimer's eyes.  We can't do this on a project.  Maybe I've invented the atom bomb here.  Because this format, we're policing it very specifically.  We want to make sure that this guy actually benefits from this experience.  And part of the experiment is to see how the audience reacts.  How do you surveil him for most of the time?  His entire apartment is outfitted with cameras. 
[02:08:30]  His car, which was given to us by one of our sponsors.  What if we just walk in the street?  We have two cameramen following him at all times, yeah.  Okay, so this guy's constantly on.  Yeah, he's constantly on.  And he's twittering live, so he's getting interaction with the audience.  The response has been incredible.  We actually crashed the servers in the first day because there was so much traffic.  People trying to watch it and people trying to participate.  So even if you're not watching, but you're signed up, you'll get alerts on your phone.  Yeah, so even if you're just doing your thing, you're out in the middle of the day, you'll get an A, B, or C. 
[02:09:00]  You vote on it.  That vote gets tallied in just a few minutes, and then he has to do what the audience wants.  Okay.  Can you imagine what we would have this guy doing?  It's in the proper hands.  Like Seth said, this idea is in the proper hands.  What's this guy's background?  Where does he come from, and how can he do this?  He's actually a really nice guy.  We went through a rigorous selection process.  He is a former IT guy who's 25 years old, tall and handsome, and yet a little socially awkward, and kind of shy, and really, really sweet, and just a basically decent fellow. 
[02:09:30]  So he's also not interested in being a celebrity, but he's willing to let himself be on camera.  And how long does this process go on?  Six weeks.  Six weeks.  It's just an experiment.  We just want to see what happens.  How did he get off for six weeks?  Well, he quit that job.  Oh, he quit.  Yeah, he was unhappy with that job, and kind of unhappy with his direction in life, and that's why you answer an ad.  Did you guys pick how he quit his job?  No.  Because I have a few suggestions. 
[02:10:00]  That's a good idea.  Yeah, the old Ralph Cramden.  You are a bum!  Well, if we do a spin-off, maybe we'll start there.  Well, that's kind of odd.  Where do you think he's going to end up after six weeks?  Is he going to get a job again and go back to a normal life, or do you think this will have some kind of impact on where his future takes?  Well, we're giving him a lot of opportunities.  We're introducing him to people.  We're presenting him with different job training.  We're trying to help him pick a direction and then put him in a position where he could achieve something. 
[02:10:30]  All of the decision-making by the audience is just kind of fun, but we're actually trying to get people to help focus him.  Are there some real life crossroad moments that take place?  Because obviously what kind of beverage he wants isn't going to make a big impact on him.  Personally, he's been through a lot, and I don't want to tip our hand or anything, but he's been through a lot with his family.  He's been through a lot in relationships.  We're going to touch on all that, help him explore all that.  But we also set up an email for people to date him, like submit their information in case they want to date him. 
[02:11:00]  And something really interesting that happened, his ex-girlfriend, who broke up with him a few years ago, has submitted herself as one of the people to date him.  And I mean, I don't want to shout her out, but she's still in a relationship presently, so I don't know what her motives are, but it's interesting.  Oh, he's scratching his ear.  He's scratching.  I just told him to do that.  I told him to do that.  I said, move, fag.  Now, does he, obviously, when he's asleep or if he's constant surveillance here, what about private moments? 
[02:11:30]  Well, you know, he can close the door in the bathroom if he's got a poop or something.  All right.  And he takes private showers.  Oh, okay.  That kind of thing.  And I guess he sleeps in PJs?  That's really up to him.  How open does he want to be online?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  What happens if he wants to score with a girl?  Oh, what's that to Rosa with the mic off?  What, Joe?  Oh, come on.  All right.  Off.  Oh. 
[02:12:00]  Jesus.  He's an insufferable prick.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Jesus.  I'm sorry, Joe.  What happens if he wants to score with a girl?  We might all get to watch him make out.  By the way, score.  Make out.  That's part of his text messaging with a girl.  That's the Vodio Doe Doe.  What the hell?  23 Skadoo.  I like how you just stuck up for me and then immediately insulted me.  Well, you fucking buried yourself with score.  Well, all right.  I think it's going to score. 
[02:12:30]  What if he wants to get some pussy?  All right.  Is that better?  Does he have to do it on camera?  I mean, it's up to him, really.  I wouldn't say that we wouldn't watch it, but that's also not our aim.  Does he have a lot of company or does he have people that come over?  Well, he's got friends that he knows and then he's meeting people as well.  And every one of his friends that he sits down with, like you watch him go to lunch with a friend and they're all just sort of remarking how weird it is to be followed by cameras.  And you talk directly to the camera as if it's the audience.  So he relates to everybody that's voting by speaking directly to them. 
[02:13:00]  It's an oddly intimate experience considering how many people are signed up.  But you as an individual are watching your computer, whatever your feed is.  You are having this singular experience with him, even though you're part of a collective.  You always come up with good ideas, Seth.  That's pretty unique.  You really do.  This may be the most dangerous idea of our time.  We're five years away from televised executions.  I can't wait.  I Twitter under at Seth Green.  I tried to keep it super simple.  Seth Green.  Yeah.  Because I'm a... 
[02:13:30]  Why?  Who has Seth Green?  Me.  It's me.  Yeah.  Green with an E?  Oh, and I.  No, no.  Just that.  But there was an imposter who was Seth Green 01.  Oh, really?  And I was like, well, all of you in the Twitterverse, it's an 01.  That should be your first indicator.  I'm going to go ahead and just be my name.  There are imposters.  I've seen some Opie imposters.  You've seen those guys?  Where are they?  Yeah.  They like...  And that is weird.  The imposter thing is really strange.  I've been solicited by people who claim that they are Zac Efron and Charisma Carpenter, 
[02:14:00]  and I know that neither one of them are on Twitter, and yet they've amassed followings,  and people are like, I'm so excited to be following you, Zac Efron, Charisma Carpenter.  And then someone else who's obviously in collusion with them is like, oh, well, Seth Green said that they were...  Then I'm like, I didn't even check my tweets.  I never said that.  Don't hang that on me, man.  What do you use Twitter for the most?  Because some people, it's just inane, nothing, here's what I had for lunch today.  It's a very specific medium.  The people that sign up for Twitter, the people that interact on Twitter, it's a completely specific form of communication. 
[02:14:30]  And it's mostly for promotions or just instant dissemination of information.  If you say, this is happening right now, and you want a million people to hear it, Twitter is the best way to do it.  Yeah, I don't like a lot of promotion on it.  And I noticed, like, Louis C.K., I love Louis, and when he's drunk on a plane and going off on Sarah Palin, there's nothing better.  Nothing better on Twitter.  But most of his are just like, hey, Louis is on FX and stuff. 
[02:15:00]  And I'm just like, there's a balance.  Louis, come on.  I try and put out things that are actually interesting to our audience.  Like, we're shooting a third Robot Chicken Star Wars special right now.  Thank God.  And so I've been putting up behind-the-scenes pictures or things from sets where this is what's going to be on the special.  Check out this cool moment.  Here's our lighting director setting up this shot.  I try and get people inside information.  But at the same time, I'll also say, oh, my gosh, you've got to follow this person or let's all meet at this movie or watch this thing over the weekend.  But you think about it.  Some of the funniest guys, they're nothing on Twitter. 
[02:15:30]  I don't think Burr's not on Twitter.  Burr just got on.  I don't know how to do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of the guys, they don't put out.  They don't put the shit out.  You're going to fucking sit there and fucking right there and eat a sandwich.  You're going to fuck yourselves.  You're going to eat that shit.  Why the fuck do I care?  You'll never see me twittering about what I'm drinking or I like juice.  That's just not what that's for.  But there's so many people that just do that.  You were talking about the Robot Chicken Star Wars thing.  Did you get to sit down with George Lucas and go over shit? 
[02:16:00]  How does he feel about this?  I've gotten to sit down with him a couple of times, which is super surreal.  That's got me.  I mean, honestly, it's super awesome.  I can't even lie about how awesome that is.  But he specifically, his whole company looks at our pages and they allow for Robot Chicken  to be a little bit more inflammatory than anything that would be actual Star Wars.  So we have a lot of leeway to do really strange stuff.  There's only a couple of times where a sketch was so crazy, no one in the company wanted to 
[02:16:30]  sign off and George actually had to approve it himself.  Does he have to approve every single...  No.  Does somebody from Lucasfilm have to...  Yeah, he's got a really strong company of people that represent all of his...  No, his interests.  Protect, must protect.  Protect.  The franchise.  But it's cool in the context of Robot Chicken, though.  Yeah.  Like, you can obviously...  You understand what the show is about.  Yeah.  And you get away with a little more than if you were just kind of some guy fucking around.  We're lucky he likes us.  That's the thing.  That's what it comes down to is he actually likes us and thinks we're funny.  Which gives us a lot more leeway than if he thought we were stupid. 
[02:17:00]  Did you go around the ranch and shit?  Get the tour?  I've been around the ranch.  Really?  Just the sickest fucking thing.  God damn it.  Does he have a golf cart?  No way.  Well, I mean, there's golf carts on site, but more than anything, there's bicycles everywhere.  So you can just grab a bike.  Just grab a bike.  And then leave it at a location where there's...  Then why is he so fat?  He's actually lost...  If you see him, he's lost a ton of weight.  He should pedal it with his chin.  Look, I know you're friends, but he does have a lot of it.  Isn't it right under the Golden Gate Bridge, basically?  No, no.  It's deep in... 
[02:17:30]  It's on Tatooine County.  Shut up.  No, it's outside of San Francisco.  I always thought...  Then my cab driver is a lying sack of shit.  I was out there saying...  Wow!  That was in Florida.  I'm coming off the Golden Gate Bridge.  He's like, yeah, there's where Lucas' whole...  I can't believe the red light 45 minutes from the Golden Gate Bridge.  Everyone knows that's where Starfleet Command is.  I'm a fucking liar.  This guy was.  I can't believe fucking Lucas fell.  The refugee didn't know where Lucas Ranch was.  Dude, I want to...  Sincerely, I'm a huge Star Wars nerd. 
[02:18:00]  I'm a huge Star Wars fan.  I actually want to say how awesome I think it is that Robot Chicken and what you guys are  doing, you're one of the...  And obviously there's millions of Star Wars nerds out there, but you guys are one of the  only things in pop culture that's considered cool right now that's still saying Star Wars  is cool because it's like this big nerd movement now to go, Star Wars sucks now and the pre...  I think that's just the older nerds that are sort of getting embittered in their later  years.  But they will see anything that Lucas puts out, though. 
[02:18:30]  But, you know, guys like me that were alive and in the theaters when the original Star Wars  came out, it's easy for us as adults to say, oh, this doesn't hold up to our stringent  standards.  But if you watch A New Hope, C-3PO's crazy annoying.  Yeah.  Crazy annoying.  And yet at four years old, he was my favorite character.  So if you look at kids between the ages of three and 12, they grew up when Phantom Menace  was in the theaters.  They love Jar Jar.  He's their favorite.  My brother-in-law, Jar Jar Jar's his favorite.  And so I just have to say, well, we're at like categoric differences in our, you know 
[02:19:00]  what I mean?  Like where that hit me versus where this hit him.  And so the Clone Wars TV show is frighteningly popular with kids like four to 15.  It's awesome.  It is awesome for adults, but there's that whole backlash movement from the older kids,  from the adult, like over 30 crowd.  They just want to, they just want to hit on.  And I've used that same argument a bunch of times because I have a nephew who's about,  I guess he's eight or nine now. 
[02:19:30]  But when I talked to him, what's your favorite Star Wars movie, buddy?  Phantom Menace.  Who's your favorite character?  Count Dooku.  You know what I mean?  He said, shut up and grow up, Joe.  You know, we'll argue it out.  But that's the undeniable thing about that brand and why it defies explanation is because  for over 30 years, it's maintained relevance and continues to solicit new fans.  It's, it's kind of, it's really impressive.  I've had ones that I've liked.  You look at guys like James Cameron, who are arguably greatest filmmakers of our time.  Right. 
[02:20:00]  And Cameron comes out about Avatar and says, I want to take on the Titans.  I want to take on the Rodden Bears and the Lucas.  And the fundamental difference between Avatar and Star Wars is you don't want to buy Avatar  toys.  Right.  And that's, that's nothing to do with how cool or exciting or what an interesting experience  that is.  You don't care to buy those toys.  And yet you can't wait to buy a t-shirt that has Darth Vader with Kanye West glasses on  it.  Yeah.  Like you're just going to buy Darth Vader with Kanye glasses because it's awesome and  funny.  Did you like Avatar?  But you don't care about, I loved Avatar.  Who'd ask me that?  No.  I loved Avatar. 
[02:20:30]  No, he did.  I did.  Yeah, he did.  But I'm not going to buy those action figures.  I'm playing with them.  Do you want to have a Navi challenge?  Do you want to have them like plugging their tails into each other?  Nah.  Is this...  Right.  Not as fun.  Did you love it because of the technology or because of the story?  I've seen that story a million times.  Of course.  We all have.  Everybody's seen that story.  Right.  But it's a well-told version of that story and it's beautifully executed and you see  visual things that you've never seen before and a style of 3D that you haven't seen.  But Star Wars itself, the first one...  New Hope.  New Hope, yeah.  Was a basic story too. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  It's your basic...  Well, it's crazy.  But it was done so well, especially for the time...  Well, it was also a revolution.  Like, it was a straight-up revolution.  No one had done a lived-in sci-fi world.  Everything was like brand new ships and brand new clothes and silver accents and everyone's  in LeMay with shiny visors.  And then you go to the Star Wars universe and there's just aliens and humans living amongst  each other as if it's no big thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody broke it down, the best I've ever heard it, where they were talking about the, 
[02:21:30]  you know, there's always the Star Trek versus Star Wars argument.  And this guy was like, Star Trek is technology.  That's what it's about.  It's where man can go and what we're capable of.  Star Wars is environment.  Like, everything around you is this completely separate world.  And I didn't realize how similar it was to Lord of the Rings until the Lord of the Rings  movies came out.  And I was like, holy shit.  Gandalf's Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Strider's Han Solo.  Frodo is Luke.  You know what I mean?  It's just, he just took that...  Wow, you are a geek.  I was thinking, Joe, I don't get to geek out. 
[02:22:00]  I don't know how excited it sets in here.  I didn't know you were a geek, Joe.  I wasn't even thinking that.  I was actually, I was thinking the same...  I was going to get to Mordor.  Yeah.  Wow, you're a true geek.  I was thinking the same exact thing.  Holy shit.  I lit up in clerks.  You got action figures at home?  I used to.  I have a box of them.  I don't have them out anymore because when you...  But you still have them, don't you?  Well, if I had a TV show on the air, I'd keep the goddamn things on display.  You know what the trick is?  I can't do it.  You gotta marry a girl with an equally large toy collection like I did. 
[02:22:30]  That is the trick.  Damn.  What did you do between...  You've always been, like, famous, though, since, you know, forever.  It's like the last 10 years.  I mean, I've been acting 30 years.  And it's only in the last, like, 10 that I could...  You could really arguably say I'm famous.  But that's a key 10 years for...  You know what I mean?  That was key 10 years.  That's a big 10 years.  I'm saying as far as, like, as far as sexual exploration, that's a good 10 years because  I haven't reached that point.  I can't have the figures out because it's...  I mean, I did my share of dating, but I also married a girl who I had a lot in common 
[02:23:00]  with, you know?  Right.  That's really the trick.  Like, if you're married to a girl who hates toys and you love toys...  You're in trouble.  I disagree.  You're going to be in a box in the attic.  Eventually, you'll argue about, like, where you can put stuff, whereas my wife and I merged  our toy collections and they've just overtaken the house.  That's awesome.  Yeah, but that's the one thing you have in common with the toys, right?  That's not the one thing.  No, we got married on purpose.  Like, we actually teamed up intentionally.  Yeah.  We got a lot in common.  Did you just shit on me to my face?  No.  Did that just happen? 
[02:23:30]  No, no, no.  I'm just...  No, we actually teamed up, fuck bag.  I'm clarifying the point.  I'm clarifying the point.  I know people, when they join forces with somebody, they make a list of...  Join forces.  You're talking to me.  You make a list of, like, pros and cons, and we just had all pros.  Yeah, right.  But you're not supposed to be with someone that you're supposed to actually have everything  in common with.  That's what they say.  No, see, I mean, there's things that she does that I don't do.  No, I'm serious, man.  Stop.  I'm fucking serious, Anthony.  There's things that she does that I don't do.  She likes to play, you know, Final Fantasy.  I don't play Final Fantasy.  She'll spend 20 hours on Final Fantasy.  So you're a true gamer? 
[02:24:00]  Me?  Yeah.  No, no.  I play Ms. Pac-Man and Tetris.  I'll crush you in both of those games.  Oh, cool.  But I don't play...  We went and played Halo, and I'm with 20 other people all playing on separate screens.  Yeah.  Everybody else is, like, sniper and changing out their weapons.  If you saw my avatar on anybody else's screen, I'm, like, running at a wall, aiming at  the sky in a circle.  You're that bad, huh?  I'm terrible.  My little cousin's a gamer, and he's got the fucking social skills of Mr. Bean.  This kid is horrible.  It's pretty ironic, too, that they make you wear a headset, because that's exactly what 
[02:24:30]  he's going to be fucking...  He's going to be working, like, Miami subs down in fucking Del Rey.  Honestly, they don't tell you that.  You know, if you ever talk to kids, you're probably your cousin or something, the young  kids, your nephew, dude, when they play games for so long, it literally...  They can't communicate.  There's a brilliant episode of South Park, the World of Warcraft episode.  Oh, that one's great.  All the kids try and get on, and there's just some dude who's built up all his powers and  strengths, and he's just sniping kids left and right, and they come to that dude, and  he can't even, like, get out of his chair. 
[02:25:00]  He's got to grab her for sandwiches.  It's ridiculous.  You know what's upsetting me?  What's upsetting me more than anything is the more Seth talks, the more I realize he's  the one I'm supposed to be with.  We literally...  He said that Tetris Mixed Pac-Man thing.  I was like, I love those games.  Fuck.  I got two things that I have to apologize for.  One, I don't swing that way, and two, I'm taken, so...  I don't swing that way either, but you're bringing up feelings that I didn't know I had.  It's like David Duchovny and Larry Sanders. 
[02:25:30]  They're actually saying you got to go, Seth, because you've got a real busy schedule.  They're, like, doing the wrap-up behind your head.  That's probably true.  All right.  Family Guy, though.  How many more years do you think that's got?  Jeez, I love that job.  It'd be great if we lasted as long as The Simpsons.  As far as jobs go, that's one of the easier ones, right?  It's one of the best jobs I've ever had.  It's a show I actually like to watch.  How long does it take you to do all your lines for a season?  I'll come in sometimes once a month and record three or four episodes at a time.  But we make over 20 episodes a year, and then they get kind of rolled into making specials 
[02:26:00]  and things like that.  So it feels like we're always making the show.  It's still a great show.  It's awesome.  I hope that never ends.  But he's here to talk about Control TV, so we suggest a lot of...  Well, this is happening right now.  If you go to ControlTV.com, you can watch the live feed and you can vote.  And if you sign up for the Twitter, at Control TV, you can get those alerts, too.  But more than anything, help us puppeteer this guy.  Yeah, yeah, no kidding.  He's still sleeping, the lazy bum.  It's nine o'clock.  He's in Los Angeles. 
[02:26:30]  It's technically six o'clock.  Fair enough.  Someone's going to light him on fire in about seven minutes.  I just took care of everything.  That's what we would do with this idea.  I got you, bro.  I got you.  How should Tristan put out the fire?  Running around, stop, drop, and roll?  Delson with water or a fire extinguisher?  We'll never be mainstream.  Because we would take this great idea and just ruin it.  We would fuck it up.  Terrible.  It's bound to happen.  I'm sure when our experiment's over, someone else will start a running man experiment.  Of course.  We're heading that way.  How great would that be?  Seth Green, ControlTV.com. 
[02:27:00]  And yeah, check it out.  Looks pretty cool.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, man.  Nice to see you.  Yep.  Absolutely.  Sweet.  Sweet.  Now it's just going to be awkward until the end of the show. 
[02:27:30]  after watching Joe DeRosa fall in love with Seth Green.  Fall in love.  And it got to a point where Seth Green had to let you down softly because he really thought  you were a gay guy.  Oh, come on.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, he did.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, he did.  He didn't.  Yeah, he did.  You are a true geek, Joe DeRosa.  I'm a fucking raging geek.  I had no idea.  Show me that video of his wife.  Jesus. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Smoking.  Yeah, then we go off the air and Seth's like, I got to brag, and then he shows us a video  of his wife, and you know what?  None of us could say anything bad about his wife.  Yeah.  She is fucking hot, man.  But he didn't have to, you know, break it up.  He didn't have to break it up.  I know.  It's weird that he brought it up.  He's a little weird.  He's bragging out of nowhere.  He's like, yeah, check out the TV show.  You guys got YouTube.  I want to show you my wife.  We weren't even talking about your wife.  It's like, dude.  Right.  It's like, dude.  And you could, you're right, you're right, it's normally the thing that you get trash 
[02:28:30]  for, and he literally threw down the Uno wild draw four, and you're like, I can't, there's  nothing I can do.  You got me.  But it had nothing to do with what we were talking about.  Basically, we're going to say, not only am I really rich and really famous, look what  I'm banging.  Yeah, exactly.  I just made two million on my last picture, but before I go, you want to see my fucking  wife.  That was a little strange.  There's a psychological thing behind that.  I won't go into it, but I think we can all figure it out.  It's not all that.  Is the psychological thing that I'm going to go home and cry about where my life is 
[02:29:00]  right now?  No.  No, Joe.  Yeah, no, I'm kidding.  Not you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You know, when you can sit down and pat him on the head while he's walking by, it might  lead to this type of thing.  Is that what you're getting at, Anthony?  Well, I wasn't going to go there.  Napoleon complex.  You weren't going to go that low, I don't think.  Come on.  Were you going to take the high road, Anthony?  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  That's terrible.  Stop.  What do we got?  Don't get short with me.  I'm sorry.  That's what I was.  I made a little comment.  What are you doing to a guy's self-esteem?  You bring in famous Seth Green.  I'm sitting next to gorgeous Colin Kane over here.  I mean, for Christ's sake, can you get me back in here with Kelly or Keith Robinson or  somebody who can feel like a human being again?  I know.  I thought it was Colin Quinn coming in today. 
[02:30:00]  It's going to be a lot easier.  I got excited.  Okay.  What?  I got excited yesterday.  They go, or when you guys were like, can you come back in tomorrow?  I go, yeah, sure.  And you go, are you, you know who's in?  Colin?  And I went, ooh.  And he went, Kane.  And I went, oh.  Dude, the worst is, I actually, you know what the fucking worst thing is?  I have, my number's blocked.  Because I don't like giving out my number much anymore.  And when I call people, it's blocked.  So when they call, they get all excited, like, hello.  And then they hear my voice.  And they're like, oh, hey, what's up, dude?  It's the fucking worst, dude.  That's the worst thing about having a blocked number. 
[02:30:30]  Because they're like, oh, what's up, dude?  Answering blocked numbers, though, is like Russian roulette.  You're like, do I want to?  Do I not?  I'll wait for it to voicemail.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then sometimes you go, fuck it.  You hit it and go, hello?  It goes to voicemail.  And all you hear is this.  I'm in practice.  I'm in practice.  You didn't like my Brett Favre.  You all fucking just looked like this.  Yeah, we got that, dude.  Well, Anthony, I'm in practice again.  I got to get this audio. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because the Brett Favre story is all over the place with his tiny penis.  And this girl, Jen Stenger, Sturger, Sturger, excuse me, Sturger was on our show.  And, you know, she's all right.  I didn't know at the time I was trying for fucking Brett Favre's sloppy seconds.  And it finally came out today that Anthony hits on, well, or used to whatever.  When I was in my single years.  Yeah.  Those were after the relationship was over.  I was in a relationship for a while.  I was single and decided, you know, if there's a girl that comes in here, I'm going to try 
[02:31:30]  to chat it up.  So we're going to get a whole.  And failed miserably.  I like how you talk about it like you're Picasso.  During my single phase.  Yes, during my single phase.  During my blue phase.  For the Pablo fans out there.  I brought your bid home for that.  Don from Texas is saying, Seth Green's wife is nude on the internet.  What?  What are we waiting for?  Why would he show us?  Danny just perked up.  Why would he show us like a geeky video on the internet? 
[02:32:00]  Dude, she was wearing a Han Solo costume.  That was better than seeing her naked to me.  You are so geeky, man.  Jesus.  Wear those tight fucking Harrison Ford pants.  Starting next week, E-Rock's going to have a whole disc of audio of Anthony picking up  girls.  Or trying.  Well, is that her?  Are those nude pictures?  They're nudes, but you can't. 
[02:32:30]  Whoa.  What movie is that?  Holy shit.  What movie is that from?  That's Carrie.  Oh, wait.  This is a Masters of Horror.  Oh, yeah.  Hang on.  Let me go to the old Mr. Skin.  Mr. Skin.  That's where you got to go.  Yeah.  Of course.  Look at those milk jugs.  I'm going to put my glasses on.  There we go.  He had to go, hey, look.  Here's my wife.  So we could just go, yeah.  Let's look at the geek video. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, talk about just showing your most loved one to a group of fucking animals.  Jesus.  Guys that you just shouldn't expose something like this to.  And especially our fans will just be like, yeah, there it is.  Hey, she's all right.  That ass shot was a little shaky.  She's all right.  Why is it?  I didn't know that.  The ass shot was a little shaky.  Was it?  Yeah.  A little bit.  Right, Colin?  Yeah, it was a high ass.  It was up by her shoulders.  We'll see.  Well, maybe not.  Maybe it was a bad angle.  It was not by the lighting or something.  I'm into it.  Yeah, that's actually Seth. 
[02:33:30]  That's Seth right there.  There's the dumper, yeah.  The dumper.  Look at that.  There's a little droop going on there, no?  It's all right.  What's going on?  I can't tell with that lighting.  It's very evil, reddish.  She's walking upstairs.  So the angle is a natural.  Fair enough.  We're watching screenshots of her getting murdered in a fucking horror movie right now.  She's supposed to look old.  I'm sorry, Joe the Geek.  We want to look at the nudity part of this.  I just want to.  I think this is what we should do, Opie.  We should start our own site where we tell Seth's wife what to do. 
[02:34:00]  You should fucking text him right now while he's on the fucking view that I got a new fucking site going.  I love it.  You know, the first thing I thought was we're going to take that fucking idea and do what you should do with that idea.  We should do it with Bobo or Ira, one of our fucking lunatics.  Is he going to the view?  He's going to the view, you said?  No, I just said that.  Oh, I thought Colin said something. 
[02:34:30]  I thought he was saying.  I was probably going to that Fox 5, good day New York thing.  Never mind.  He's probably, yeah, just getting his limb lengthened.  Can we get to the audio of Anthony trying to pick up the Brett Favre check?  Yes, the Brett Favre check.  She came in and gave us a whatever interview, but at the end, Anthony was showing his game.  I'm still hung up on the fact that she doesn't have a boyfriend.  I'm kind of looking like, why?  Why?  I don't understand how, you know.  I'm just too busy for it, honestly.  Is that what it is? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, and I find a lot of the guys up here are just very self-serving, very egotistical.  Yeah, I find that too.  Oh, really?  Where do you live?  Hoboken.  Oh, really?  No, your dress.  No, your clothes.  No, your dress.  I don't like her.  No.  It took one clip.  I don't like her.  I just...  She's way too full of herself, man.  You know what?  She's way too fucking full of herself.  I'm trying to be laid back.  Yeah, what?  Go ahead.  Tell me.  I don't care.  You know what, guys?  Whatever.  You from Hoboken?  You from Hoboken?  Yeah, Hoboken.  That's close.  That's good.  Yeah, correct.  I just find that these guys are too self-serving and too egotistical. 
[02:35:30]  I need a real dumb fucking mook that'll send me pictures of his dick so I can sell him out  to the media.  Exactly.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  I don't like these guys with self-esteem that'll put me in my dumb place.  Now I know why she doesn't have a boyfriend.  All right, let's continue.  You have no time?  You can't find any time to go out or anything?  You don't find any time to socialize?  You know what?  It's just that my type doesn't include people that GTL on a regular basis.  What's that?  Well, Jim Tan Laundry, you don't watch The Jersey Shore? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, I don't remember that.  I don't watch it very often, but I watched it for like two seconds, and I was just like,  I'm now dumber for watching this.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  I don't date because of that show.  Joe Seething, right?  You fucking...  Yeah, I'm with you on this one.  I'm dumber for watching this.  Unlike what?  Unlike your brilliant show on Versus, you fucking nitwit.  I'm kind of with you, Joe.  I'm kind of with you on this one, man.  Joe does not like...  No, there's something about her, man.  You were in love with Seth, and now you're bashing her. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, because Seth comes in and he's like...  You are a homo.  Yeah, he's like, hey, what the fucking Lucas Ranch is saying shit I care about.  I know, that is kind of cool.  Yeah.  Fucking chick.  I'm a Lucas Ranch.  I just don't have time.  Go fuck...  What are you so busy doing?  Yeah.  Doing what?  Doing what?  What is she doing?  She hosts that show on...  Floating fucking sound and...  I'm too busy ruining people's lives.  Yeah.  Anthony, the audio continues.  Of course it does.  What she looks for in a guy. 
[02:37:00]  This is the same girl that kind of has that controversy with Brett Favre right now.  And Anne tries to relate.  Oh, okay.  Because that is what I'm surrounded by.  What do you look for in a guy?  What would be a nice night out for you?  A nice night out?  Honestly, I'm a dive bar kind of girl.  I don't like clubs.  I don't really do a lot of drinking or partying.  I could if there's just something good on TV and a few characters just talking at the bar.  Exactly.  A couple of beers and you could just hang out and kind of overhear some conversation.  That's why I like my show.  That's what it feels like. 
[02:37:30]  That's the same kind of thing.  God, me and you, I feel something here.  You could be my future ex-husband.  I see this.  As long as there is the, you know, portion between now and the ex part, that's fine by  me.  And they all fucking, they all say the same fucking thing.  You know, man, despite my fake tits and my ass implants and my highlighted hair, I'm  just a regular girl.  I like a cold beer and some fucking, oh, go fuck yourself. 
[02:38:00]  Go fuck yourself.  They all like, because I fucking deal with it as a comic.  I meet girls after shows and they go, they go, you're so funny.  I love when you tell those stories about when you flip out with people and stuff.  It's so funny.  I could so relate to it.  Yeah.  It's funny up until real life when they're with me on a date and they see me flip out  and they're like, uh, what the fuck are you doing right now?  Where's the funny guy?  They're so full of shit. 
[02:38:30]  You heard it all from the stage, dummy.  Yeah.  I'm so tired of that.  Angelina Jolie.  I'm just a regular girl.  I'm just a normal girl.  That's why I adopt kids from all over the fucking world.  You're not a normal fucking girl.  Normal people, oh, you don't get their fucking eyelid tattooed and go adopt a baby.  His vein's getting bigger.  His vein is getting bigger.  Sit down.  I'm sorry Seth rejected you, but sit down.  He's angry for so many reasons.  Please sit down.  You're going to have an aneurysm. 
[02:39:00]  Fucking thinking of all those action figures and fucking Ms. Pac-Man.  Then you got Jim Norton helping you out here, eh?  Jim Bragg's about Anne's house and Jen deflects.  You'll hear her deflect.  Oh, that's never got anything to do with you.  The deflection.  He has a gentleman's house.  Another good one.  Nice.  I am quite a gentleman.  No, no.  It's actually set up very nice.  It's a large house.  You'd think a family would live there, but I just pound around there alone. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, my God.  Yes, that is my movie theater.  Yes.  I like how you don't have any friends sitting around you.  Friends I consider pesky.  You know, you don't need a lot of friends.  Me too.  Anthony just hires black people to sit and he can throw them out for talking.  I was just having that conversation with someone the other day.  There's the deflection.  Jimmy, funny line.  I like how you threw in.  You're like, it's a big house.  You know, you would think a family lives there. 
[02:40:00]  That tele-speaks volume.  Yeah, yeah.  Right there I said 15 things with saying one thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  By the way.  Total fear of commitment.  There's no family there.  I'm not married.  I don't have kids.  All that was said.  Yeah.  Don't you wish you had that audio fader in real life?  Oh, I was just talking about them.  Shut the fuck up.  Holy shit.  No, but dude, she likes regular guys, man. 
[02:40:30]  Regular guys.  Yeah.  She likes a guy like you.  Knock around guys like Brett Favre.  Yeah, there you go.  I like regular guys with regular dicks so I could put their pictures up on the internet.  Yeah.  Sell my fucking voicemails to someone.  When a girl like that says that I like regular guys, what she means is I like when Brad Pitt  plays a regular guy in a movie.  That's what she fucking means.  You are nailing this right on the head, man. 
[02:41:00]  Holy shit.  With that, Ann has a bar and guns.  So you went with the bar and guns stuff.  I went with bar and guns?  Yeah, to try to get Jennifer Sturger, the Brett Favre girl kind of thing.  Come with me here.  I could kill you or two if you will.  What's your poison?  What do you like to drink?  I don't drink a ton, but when I do, I usually am sticking to like beer.  Just beer, yeah?  Yeah.  What do you like?  Like regular light beer?  Yeah, just regular.  Why are you showing me him holding lots of weapons? 
[02:41:30]  That's what's enticing.  Hey, that's a funny picture.  Stop it.  That was photoshopped.  He doesn't actually.  Oh, my God.  I'll show you my toy.  No one owns a gun like that, obviously.  That would be crazy.  Put my bar up there.  What are you trying to do, you cock blocker?  He's holding a rifle and a free Cuba pamphlet.  He's like, does this look like someone you can trust when he spins the screen to me?  I know.  I blatantly called him a cock blocker.  At that point, it's like, hey, you cock blocker.  The girl's right there.  It's just, oh, great. 
[02:42:00]  Is that the picture?  The Life Magazine fucking Lee Harvey Oswald shot?  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, man.  He was pulling out all the stuff.  Fix the contrast.  I love it.  It would have looked a lot better.  Ant thinks they have a lot in common.  Oh, really?  God, I think we have a lot in common.  I think we'd probably have fun if we just kind of went out.  Yeah, we'll just have to have one of the guys set it up.  Yeah, I guess we will.  No, one of the guys will have to set it up.  Well, why wouldn't you maybe go out to, like, you know, a nice... 
[02:42:30]  I'll have my people.  Do you know how to work an iPhone?  You don't even know who my people are.  Do you know how to work an iPhone?  Bring the hot chicken from the hallway.  Do you know how to work an iPhone?  Um, not really.  Give her your iPhone.  So she can maybe, you know, put her...  No, I can feel these things, Opie.  Yeah.  That's what ain't happening?  I can feel these things and, um...  I don't know.  Maybe the truth is the reason I don't have a boyfriend is because I might be a lesbian.  I haven't decided yet, but that's what I'm thinking.  How many women have you been with?  None.  There's always a hot chick that you think you go, maybe... 
[02:43:00]  I had that experience a couple weeks ago.  Well, I can help you out there, too.  I'll drag some over the house.  Whatever you need.  See, now she wants to sound dangerous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, and also, too, I haven't decided yet.  Maybe I'll do this, maybe I'll do that.  I've just floated through life and been fucking handed everything.  I'll do whatever I want without having to put any real fucking stake in it.  She sucks.  I knew it was time to reach down, pull the ejection handle.  Oh, really? 
[02:43:30]  Fucking maverick my ass out of that fucking...  Oh, really?  Well, because I knew it was in a weird place.  I was in a flat spin, but I'm going to eject.  And that's why I had to get involved, to really make it uncomfortable.  Thanks.  I'm going to play Ant's last card.  He has a giant Italian hog.  He does, though.  Yeah.  He has a giant Italian hog.  Huge.  Penis.  His penis is fucking big.  Yeah.  Do I look Italian?  Is that supposed to entice me?  Are you?  Well, I'm just saying Italian because he's Italian.  Check. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, you really?  Yeah.  Oh, oh, this will make me feel better.  I hope.  Have you ever been with a black man?  No.  All right.  Damn it.  I was hoping she said yes, so then I could just go, okay, forget it.  But then again, she did earlier say her father would kill her for the one thing.  I'm an equal opportunity dater, but I just, I can't, I don't know.  That's just something I haven't delved into yet.  Yeah, that's a big line to cross right there.  Exactly.  See?  Hey, now we have something else in common. 
[02:44:30]  Racism.  No, I'm not at all.  Joe, to you, sir.  Because everyone's begging.  They're like, please, more Jaded DeRosa.  They're calling you, he's the shit, Trent Rice.  It's fucking, and her only response to everything is, is that supposed to entice me?  That's the word.  That's the word of the word.  I was never a fan of girls like that.  Yeah, it's like, there's something that's of a huge turnoff there, right?  It's fucking dismissive.  What is it?  She's sitting there like a fucking queen, like King Henry the fucking eighth, going, going, 
[02:45:00]  next, be gone, be gone.  I'm growing bored with this right now.  That's what pisses me off about that.  I like regular guy shit.  You know what?  If you do like regular guys, yeah, that should entice you.  You're talking to a psychopath gun nut right now, who's got a mansion, close by, and a  big dick, and a fucking bar, and a movie theater.  What more do you want? 
[02:45:30]  Go get drunk in his fucking Scarface house, and sit in the fucking movie theater, and watch  Rambo, and shoot his guns off.  Not enough.  I'm bored with this.  What else?  Yeah, move on.  Fuck you.  And then Ant officially gets shot down.  By the way, this starts a whole new bit that we're going to continue with next week.  All the girls that Anthony has hit on.  I would say in the past couple of years, I was usually trying. 
[02:46:00]  So, E-Rock's pulling everything out.  There's a lot.  Who else was there?  There was the chick from Saw was one of your...  You guys talked about that before.  Yeah, the chick from Saw, the chick from Lost.  Did you land any of them?  Did you get any of them?  No.  Not one?  No.  I went out with a penthouse girl, but it was Tanner.  She sort of said yes.  It was Tanner, and when she comes to New York now, no one...  She never fucking even, like, says anything.  She, like, has to sneak into New York.  It's hilarious. 
[02:46:30]  Porn.  You know, the porn chick, a chick from Lost, a chick from Saw, you really go after chicks  that have been in panic situations.  I know, right?  I figure they're used to it.  They're used to it.  They're used to it.  They're used to the guns and the danger, the violence.  Well, here it is.  Ant gets shot down, but on his way out, he's still trying.  Oh, really?  At least I'm feeling some sympathy from the listeners that say, wow, Anthony just got  shot down in front of so many people.  Wow.  Yeah, that was a bad one. 
[02:47:00]  No, but at least you saw it coming this time.  I usually...  Unlike the other times.  How did I get fucking broadsided on that one?  By your partner.  Oh, he slammed two torpedoes into our side.  By your partner.  We're an alternative couple.  I didn't want her to break up the partnership.  That's hilarious.  Unlike the other times.  Wait till you're next week.  It's going to be one after another.  I can't. 
[02:47:30]  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  Cluster fuck.  I usually...  Unlike the other times.  No, the other times I've gotten numbers at least and stuff.  At least you saw this one coming, so it wasn't that awkward for everybody.  Yeah, I know.  I thought, you know...  He's just cock-balking himself at this point in time.  No, I was waiting for somebody like you to walk into my life.  Attaboy, Anthony.  I gotta stop it.  I was being sarcastic at that point.  Please.  Were you?  Please.  I do the same thing, though, like when you try to make the racist joke at her. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Like, I do the same thing.  As soon as I know I'm not scoring, I'm just like...  Then it's like, yeah.  I'm like, how can I insult her quickly?  I'm a racist.  You suck.  You're a racist.  Yeah.  You're not that hot.  Fuck you.  Yeah, dude.  Rule of thumb with chicks, man.  The hotter they are, the crazier they are.  For the most part.  Lunatics.  Yeah, it's my experience.  I don't know.  Just the real pretty ones.  They're just fucked.  Bat shit crazy.  Fucking nuts.  The whole life, they're just...  I was out with...  Well, the ugly ones are crazy, too.  You're just...  Probably you've never dated one. 
[02:48:30]  You motherfucker.  Aw, man.  Did you ever go hogging, Colin?  Yeah, come on.  Did you ever go hogging?  Hogging for him is a nine.  Yeah, exactly.  She had a pimple on her face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's hogging.  Her shoe was untied.  Right.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  Fucking ridiculous.  Hogging.  Fuck you, Hogging.  Look at this fucking guy.  Fuck you, everybody.  Fucking Ed Burns face with this guy.  Just to believe that...  Go for it, dude.  Go for it.  I've told you a million times.  You're a fucking stunning man.  I'm not embarrassed to admit it. 
[02:49:00]  Joe needs to fucking just say it this morning.  I know.  So say it.  Just fucking say it, Joe.  Just say it.  Joe, say it.  I love you.  Just say it.  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Don't commit to that at least.  It's a gray area.  Now, this fucking dude, it's like, I love Colin, but we can't...  We're friends, man.  I've known you for a long time, but it's like, I can't get too close to Colin, because  I could never go hunt chicks with him.  You're the fat chick. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, my...  I'll be on the fat chick.  If you're out with Colin, you are the fat chick that wrecks the night for the hot chick  that wants to date Colin.  Did you ever see League of Their Own?  Yeah.  I'm like, he's Gita Davis, and I'm that fucking fatso retard that they dress up in the ball  gown halfway through the movie.  Like, there's no fucking way.  I got a good arm.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Nah, man.  Some of these...  Get it.  No, these ugly chicks, the one thing I can't stand is these chicks who are just so confident,  but they're just disgusting. 
[02:50:00]  I mean, a lot of times...  Don't need to any of the confidence.  A lot of times you get these chicks who are like, you know, she went to an Ivy League school  and she's just horrible, you know?  Some of these chicks...  That's all I want to say about the light fucking...  You know what I'm saying?  These fucking ugly, confident chicks, they're just awful.  They're fucking awful.  So, this is...  They're all...  Listen...  I can have anything I want.  Yeah, just not men, sweet text.  Go fucking wait in the car, turn the heat on, come out in three years.  I'm not...  Like, believe it or not, man, I'm really...  I'm not a sexist dude.  I just get angry about the fucking hypocrisy of it. 
[02:50:30]  And these things keep happening with the Tiger Woods, the Brett Favre, over and fucking  over.  But it's money.  It's money, dude.  It's money, dude.  It's like you can't be...  Like you're saying, you can't be ugly and a cunt.  You've got to...  And you shouldn't be pretty and a cunt either.  That's not cool either.  But it's like, either have something to offer.  You know what I mean?  Have some laurel to rest on where you go, I'm really hot, but I'm a cunt.  And you go, oh, fucking cunt.  But she...  Man, look at her ass.  Or be fucking hideous and you'd be like, she's cool, though, man. 
[02:51:00]  She's a good fucking girl.  You know what I mean?  But to be both negatives, that doesn't equal positive.  It doesn't mean you're strong.  It just means you're a shitty human being.  It's unjustified arrogance.  You're walking around like a fucking Will Ferrell character at the end of the day.  You're like, what are you, just a hump?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Ron Burgundy?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck, man.  Well, let's wrap up the audio of Anthony going after Jennifer Sturger. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, there's more.  More?  What the fuck did I do?  What, did I crawl out of my knees?  That's just the end of the clip we started.  Come on, Anthony.  I was waiting for somebody like you to walk into my life.  Attaboy, Ange.  Attaboy.  Attaboy.  If only I could say it with a straight face.  All right, so we've got to take a break.  Versus is the channel.  Versus.  She can't stop me from jerking.  Jerking off to our show. 
[02:52:00]  Exactly.  Way to go out in style.  You know what?  I'm like, why did they leave this stupid plug in there now?  Oh, Jesus.  Perfect.  You're right.  Perfect.  When you know you're done, you're fucking done.  You're done.  That's it.  I'm going to jerk off to your TV show.  Fireball in the whole area.  Go down.  Go down like fucking Nino Brown.  If I'm going down, I'm taking a whole lot of motherfuckers with me.  Kamikaze in my ass right into the bridge.  Blaze of glory, dude. 
[02:52:30]  Blaze of fucking glory, man.  It's just the fucking, you know, man.  I was out to, we did a show the other night, and I was out with my buddy Aaron after the  show.  We had a, it was a great show.  We had a great time.  We're hanging out with these girls after the show at a bar.  And there's one, and she's a beautiful girl.  And I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to approach this girl.  She's really cute.  I want to talk to her.  So I start talking to her.  I get her number.  Dude, I'm being as upfront and candid with this girl as I can be, but like in a charming 
[02:53:00]  way.  And I'm like, I want to call you.  She's like, all right.  And I go, don't give me your number if you don't want me to call.  I'm going to call you.  You know what I mean?  Like, let's do this for real.  Jeez, that sounds like a threat.  And she's like, no, I'm going to fucking call you.  You know, but it was funny.  We're laughing.  And she's like, call me.  You better call me.  All right.  I'm expecting to call you.  So I go, okay, cool.  She gives me her number.  She goes to leave.  I walk outside.  She's outside taking pictures with my other, with my buddy Aaron.  She's got her arms all over him.  She gives him her number, leaves the bar, comes back, goes directly to him two hours 
[02:53:30]  later, hangs up, literally just ignores me like I was never there.  And we were talking about this and I go, dude, do you believe the fucking audacity of  that?  Like, it's fine if you don't like me.  I can deal with that.  But it's like, if I did that to two girls, it would be a shit storm.  It would be a shit storm.  It's un-fucking-real.  They're eager.  Like, I used to have a bit I did in my act, but it was a true story.  I had sex with a girl one time.  We wake up the next day and she goes, that never would have happened if I wasn't so drunk 
[02:54:00]  last night.  Wow.  She said that to you?  She said that to me.  I go, can you imagine if I said that to a woman?  Like, you know, hey baby, that never would have happened if I wasn't.  Rape!  I wouldn't even get the sentence out of my fucking mouth.  Literally.  I would not even finish the sentence, dude.  These chicks can do things where if you did it, you're a creep, you're rapey.  Rapey.  Oh, it fucking drives me nuts.  You must have felt like a piece of dog shit that night. 
[02:54:30]  Like, she gives you the number and then she goes outside and then you just see like, I'm  being blown off.  You know why I felt horrible too?  This is really, this is true and this is really sad actually.  Like, I saw her and I was like, I was like, you know what, dude, this chick is usually  someone I would think is out of my league.  And I go, you know what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I go, I'm not selling myself short, dude.  I'm a good person.  I'm going to fucking talk to this girl.  Oh, you talked your way up.  That's right. 
[02:55:00]  You talked yourself up.  Yeah.  And I got her number and I'm like, God damn it.  Yeah.  I fucking did it.  It can work.  And then she showed me immediately.  No, you can't.  No.  No, you can't.  Put you right back where you belonged, motherfucker.  Yeah, without an ounce of remorse, without an ounce of remorse, dude, it's, I can't even.  I'm just done.  Wow.  That is fucking brutal.  That's like school shit that happens to you in school and you go home going fucking bitch  and then you have to have it happen like last week. 
[02:55:30]  Well, dude, it's like, it's like, it's like Burr says in his act.  It is school shit because, because when you, like, Burr's got that thing in his act about  like when you don't face that threat of physical harm for your whole life.  Right.  That school shit carries into your adulthood.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Guys, that shit gets knocked out of us at 11, 12 years old.  I love when Burr's doing that.  She knows she's not going to get hit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She knows you're not going to punch her in the face.  It's so, it's so true, dude. 
[02:56:00]  And it's like, it's like, you know, it's, we get that shit knocked out of us and then,  and then they fucking don't.  And then they just carry that.  It's such fucking immaturity.  Like, you know, they float through life like that chick.  Maybe I'm a lesbian.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I haven't decided yet.  Really?  You're just going to decide what you want to fucking be?  Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?  You sociopath.  You like snatch or not.  And if you don't like it, you're not a lesbian.  If you do, you do.  But it's not some sort of fucking. 
[02:56:30]  Well, that's the other thing, too.  They just fucking say whatever.  Oh, Jesus.  Joe.  Joe.  I've got to stop.  Joe, listen to me.  Joe.  Joe.  I love this.  Joe, look at me.  It's unbelievable.  You need to get laid.  I just got laid two days ago.  Yeah.  I'm doing all right, believe it or not.  I know how to bottle this up.  You certainly do.  Dude, if a woman is a woman, if she's a respectable person, a respectful person, an individual, 
[02:57:00]  dude, I'll treat her like a queen, dude.  I got no problem with that.  None.  But you can't fucking base your decision on women just on this one girl who fucking  negs you at this shit bar upstate.  You got to fucking.  I'm not.  I'm basing it on everything I see in the news and in the.  But that's the news, you know.  That's the thing.  That's why I say I'm not sexist.  Yeah.  I just hate certain women that do this.  You know what I mean?  There are certain women that do this and there's a lot of them that do it now.  Yeah.  And it's fucking ridiculous, man.  It's a world.  It's ridiculous.  It's a world.  We got to get we got to get one more break in and then we're going to finish up with 
[02:57:30]  these guys.  Yes.  Joe DeRozan and Colin.  What are we promoting today, boys?  Joe, what do you got?  My, you know, my CD's out.  So please go buy it.  The the depression auction is the title.  It's on Comedy Central Records.  You can get it at iTunes and Amazon.  And I'm going to be at Helium in Philadelphia the weekend of October 30th.  Me and Amy Schumer are co-headlining at Helium.  So that's cool.  Yeah.  So check that out.  What do you got going on, brother?  I'm probably just going to just bury pornos at the show.  In the woods. 
[02:58:00]  In plastic Ziploc bags.  I threw that out there.  You guys like creepy.  I'm in Hartford tonight.  You can check out ColinCain.com.  Okay.  For tickets.  And then that's what's going on, man.  All right.  Maybe I'll explain the porn thing after the break.  It just showed you're a lot younger than me in that.  The fact that I bury pornos?  Yeah, because I think we used tinfoil.  Because I don't think they had fucking Ziplocs.  I didn't use anything.  I don't think they had Ziplocs back then.  I just put them in the tree for it.  I didn't keep them in my house because I knew my fucking...  Yeah, we all hid our shit. 
[02:58:30]  But I don't think we had the option of Ziploc bags to keep the moisture out.  I came home from school one day and on the table was about 17 porno mags with a little  yellow post-it note from my dad.  See Me.  Oh, really?  Yeah, dude.  Found the collection, dude.  At least he knew you weren't gay.  He should have been happy.  Still.  I'm sorry to the gay people, but I mean, it was a different era back then.  Joe was actually taking a piss right now.  I'm concerned that maybe your son was gay.  Yeah.  I went with that and I'm sorry.  Yeah, like fathers don't still find it a great concern.  Give me a break.  The virus.  Sirius XM. 
[02:59:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm so tired.  I can't take.  I'm a liar and a pain.  I'm a baby. 
[02:59:30]  I'm a baby.  I'm having a great show with Joe DeRosa and Colin Cain.  As far as Twitter goes, I believe it's just Colin Cain on Twitter.  Yes.  Cain's spelled K-A-N-E.  Yes.  Well, it could be the...  Yes, sir.  It could be the Cain and Abel thing.  I don't know.  Is there a way to spell Cain? 
[03:00:00]  Let's go through all of them right now.  That's okay.  Joe DeRosa comedy, I think, on Twitter.  That's right.  Thank you.  If you want to follow Joe and his bitterness...  I've got to follow you, Joe.  Matt in Queensbury writes, DeRosa's killing today, but Jesus Christ, make sure he takes  some blood pressure medication after the show today.  Sound like fucking Pat Cooper in here today.  What's happening with these people?  A little angry constantly.  How has he not died of a heart attack, that Pat Cooper, with all that anger and energy 
[03:00:30]  that he throws out?  Keeps you going, dude.  Your angst keeps you going.  That's what some people would say.  Hey, thin gals and fat pay.  Yeah.  I guess it was a slow news day.  The newspaper.  Skinny girls make a lot more money than...  They say curvy girls, but we all know what that means.  Fat.  Yeah.  Fat fucks.  Yeah.  And they compare her to a girl that weighs 134 pounds.  The average girl weighs 164 pounds.  And they compare her with a girl that weighs 194 pounds. 
[03:01:00]  And they're saying that the skinny girl makes $10,719 more per year on average.  The fat girl.  I wonder how they did that.  Did they just pick two girls out that were fat?  Is it an average thing?  The fat girl makes $9,873 on average less than skinny girls.  Well, you know, there's going to be setbacks to the lifestyle you choose. 
[03:01:30]  What are you going to do?  You know?  Is it different for fat guys?  Do fat guys make equal?  I don't know, man.  Probably not.  A lot of executives are, you know, overweight guys.  Yeah.  But that's because they become executives, right?  And then get fat.  Maybe that's it.  I don't know how they did this.  That's a good question.  Over 25 years, if a working gal has a 25-year career, this is where the stats are fucked up.  Because now she's losing her looks 25 years in.  So she's not making as much, right?  Right.  Yeah.  I agree. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  I agree.  I agree.  You never see fat, old secretaries, do you now?  No.  You don't.  No.  You see old secretaries.  You see old secretaries.  They're not fat, old secretaries.  They're gone.  Over 25 years, the skinny girl will make $389,000 more than the fat girl.  Gaining 30 pounds can result in a $15,574 loss in annual pay.  Good for them.  In annual pay.  It shows willpower.  It shows fucking, you know, stick-to-itiveness. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  They, you know.  And they're probably working more because they're not eating.  Yeah.  Most of the time.  That's a message to all you fat girls.  Yeah.  Work a little harder.  You got to fucking.  That's great.  That was a great message, too.  Because, you know, there's some fat chick right now who hates being fat, and then you  just told her she's not going to make money.  She's going to be broke.  She's not going to get skinny feeling sorry for herself.  Get up there and try a little bit.  Come on.  Work that fucking, work that ass off and make a few bucks. 
[03:03:00]  You know, you want to lay around all day.  You know, you wonder why you're making less money.  You lazy bitch.  That's unbelievable.  You mean Anthony's show.  You mean Anthony.  For the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
