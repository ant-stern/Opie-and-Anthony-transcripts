<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a furious, profanity-laced tirade against the newly announced American Idol judges, Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez.  The hosts vehemently criticized the choices, mocking their age and questioning their suitability, contrasting them unfavorably with the departed Simon Cowell.  They relentlessly mocked the excessive online commentary and blogging surrounding the announcement, repeatedly using the phrase "blog blog blog" and referencing "twitterfall.com." This segment segued into a lengthy, wildly inappropriate, and highly detailed (and exaggerated) description of a supposedly violent and sexually suggestive fight scene involving Fonzie from *Happy Days*, featuring copious amounts of offensive language and sexual innuendo.  The hosts also discussed Henry Winkler's personality outside of his Fonzie persona.

The conversation briefly returned to American Idol, incorporating listener calls and speculation about ratings before pivoting to a discussion of the radio industry's failure to anticipate the rise of satellite radio.  This included playing audio clips from 2001 of an interview with a radio executive, Ken Stevens (GM), who dismissively predicted satellite radio would remain a niche market. The hosts contrasted Ken's comments with the eventual success of XM, mocking his shortsightedness and the industry’s overall lack of foresight. This section also included a recording of a previous show segment with Ken Stevens defending his decision to run commercials for satellite radio on their terrestrial show; the hosts used this as evidence of their own prescience.  A lengthy, crude analysis of old commercials followed, focusing on the discrepancies between their marketing and the actual health consequences of the advertised products (KFC and cigarettes), and a critique of their lack of racial diversity.  The hosts also played a portion of a phone call with Ken Stevens, which included a list of historically inaccurate technological predictions.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Amy Schumer's debate with Steven Crowder regarding abstinence, which was accompanied by sexually explicit jokes and comments from the hosts. This led into a segment titled "O&A Theater," a short, nonsensical skit. The hosts mentioned upcoming guests Joe DeRosa and Danny McBride (a phone call was anticipated), Jimmy's upcoming trip to Marco Island, and the return of *Eastbound & Down*. Numerous listener calls punctuated this segment.

A caller’s anecdote about his ex-wife's change in sexual behavior after marriage triggered a discussion about religion, specifically Catholicism's teachings on premarital sex, and the hosts’ general skepticism towards organized religion. Anthony shared a personal anecdote about his childhood fear of the universe's vastness, and proposed a "God elimination theory" to explain why bad things happen to religious people. This section was interspersed with humorous retellings of their experiences at religious retreats. The conversation then moved to a discussion of various musical artists—MGMT, Pavement, Sonic Youth, the Black Crows, the Pixies, Faith No More, and Bob Dylan—and Opie's questionable memory of seeing Sonic Youth open for the Black Crows, leading to an attempt to verify this with listener calls. This segment concluded with George Carlin's comedic bit about God.  Joe DeRosa was a guest in the studio during this portion.  A phone call with Danny McBride was anticipated.

A later segment covered a range of disparate topics: the underwhelming performance of a cover band and an 80s hair band reunion, Sebastian Bach's comments about Nirvana and grunge, a negative anecdote about a Bob Dylan concert, and experiences with Pinkberry and Shake Shack, including a humorous anecdote about a Pinkberry employee. The hosts also recounted various pranks, including one involving feces and bread. A Bob Kelly phone call and a video of a woman dancing in a motorized wheelchair were discussed.  The segment concluded with a phone call from Danny McBride.

Finally, the show featured comedian Joe DeRosa and actor Danny McBride as in-studio guests. The primary focus was the return of *Eastbound & Down*, with McBride discussing the show's hiatus, creative process, and returning and new characters.  His use of prosthetic breasts in *Machete* sparked a discussion about body parts used in film.  McBride's comedic talent was praised and compared to Steve Carell.  The conversation also touched on the show’s inspiration from British comedies like *The Office*. A listener, Dan from Minneapolis, exchanged phone numbers with DeRosa on air.  The segment concluded with promotion of DeRosa’s stand-up shows and *Eastbound & Down*.  Throughout the entire broadcast, copious amounts of vulgar language and sexually explicit humor were used consistently.

[00:09:00]  will judge american idol it's official like i was very happy everyone had to announce that it's  official update american idolized i don't know what that is she got 12 million dollars for the year  first official photo of american idol judges okay i see the official photo dan is that is that it i  tweeted the official photo where on my twitter oh i was the first i took the photo yes you did 
[00:09:30]  they're so excited yeah you see all this and they're wearing all judges  new american fans wanted conic jr oh fans wanted him me  fucking terrible this guy just writes honestly american idol's new season's gonna suck  why is he gonna suck if they got really cool fucking talent on that stage right harry connor jr  is the same baby that got mad in australia and walked off when they did a fucking blackface  that's right fuck that baby well he's from new orleans and he's very on tv right now j-lo and 
[00:10:00]  steven tyler new american idol judges gee i wonder why it's the top story on channel 5 fox news  do we have audio of him talking to somebody oh steven tyler i'm glad we still have randy there  that's all i can say because you know in the show cornerstone i have american idol  losing simon cowell that's a real issue isn't it yes it is it's an issue but it's going to be very  interesting to see the dynamic of these three hopefully they spend a lot of time together  between now and when season 10 kicks off in january but randy jackson kind of brings that comfortable 
[00:10:30]  sense of american idol what we're used to because if they kind of cleaned out everybody i think people  would be a little bit more leery to watch really this is going to be for ratings for the show  because this was the big shake-up the big shake-up was intended to bring in a lot of new people  what does it mean it's going to go up it's going to shoot right in the beginning don't you think  ratings our readers at hollywoodlife.com we think the ratings are going to go up this is exactly what  the show needed a revamped makeover as to whether or not that can last the whole season if this is 
[00:11:00]  just the intrigue in the beginning of the season jaylor's looking for the next michael jackson i mean ellen  you know she petered out and we've had a series of people coming in and coming out very quickly  a fucking dead cross-dresser could that guy be a man she's always fun to watch just be a man  so much estrogen sitting next to that pregnant woman but how does that translate to being a show  person you said stephen tyler is a showman he's done it his whole life a showman he's 63 years old  he falls off the stage there's no question that everybody is perfect to help pick out new talent 
[00:11:30]  and they all are very invested in focusing less on the judging panel and we're finding those  very girl next door look but still the chemistry remains important between all of us  it really doesn't hang out because back in the day paula simon and randy they all used to hang  out together before the show so hopefully they get that chemistry let's hope they hang out before  the show yourself well i thought you hung out with stephen tyler though wasn't that the way  no she's the biggest groupie of stephen tyler  he checked off my face once after a show 
[00:12:00]  yeah yeah these guys they remember those concerts back in the 70s right  yeah when you were in the crib remember  70s  we'll have more on it including exclusive interviews with the new judges that's coming up  exclusive interviews and speaking of age a big day for you today there's a big anniversary  in the now it household yes that's right uh it what the first time i hate a fucking faggy  co-host the fucking nine months ago she was fucked and uh it's uh the sperm hit the egg and 
[00:12:30]  no she uh happened she just gave birth to a kid she's going with irish twins is she yeah man that  was the one that we just watched having a fucking baby i was pregnant all over the place she was  just pregnant for two years gestation of a fucking elephant she looks good pregnant though she doesn't  look bad she's pretty she's a dummy i'm sure she is she does a little time on the fox news channel  too on weekends she is as dumb as they come i i don't know uh there's no reason to know her name  so i don't know it sorry i wish i did know it we watch her every morning too that's how unimportant 
[00:13:00]  she is she's pretty i don't even know her name after watching her for two straight years  paula abdul looking for the next michael jacks and then the guy he can't even be a man about it  he's it's they can't discuss it like like we do here it's all bubbly and oh what are they gonna  do i know the ratings what do you think i think they're gonna shoot up but can they be sustained  chloe that was the news right there that was that was the news the news go fuck yourself there's a 
[00:13:30]  fucking you know every dopey fucking diplomat is in new york city yeah and nothing about that  except for the fact that traffic's gonna suck a royal cock they're gonna be over by you dude  what are they doing over obama where's obama uh he's at the waldorf astoria hotel where's that  it's down there by fucking park avenue that's not where i live no but then he's gonna he's gonna  know where he leaves what he leaves and then he's gonna be over by columbus circle doing what

[00:28:00]  with fucking ted mcginley  ted mcginley  so what are you going to ruin  married with children  that wasn't fonzie  he ruined a lot of series  he was the guy they brought in  at the end of uh  yes  sitcoms  to try to keep it going on  to try to keep it going  yep  oh he's there all along  i'm sorry  i think he was the boyfriend  right  yeah  margie  marcy  marcy  marcy originally had the husband  right  but he only lasted for like  two or three seasons  and then it was ted mcginley  for the rest of the run  yeah he was in there for a while  who was the original marcy 
[00:28:30]  it was amanda something  what they brought in a new marcy  oh we didn't switch out marcy  oh is this the difference  she was a dyke  she wound up coming out  as a dyke  who's the husband  he was the only one  that was  and then later on in the season  they tried to bring in a new kid  to save the series  they brought in seven  yeah  oh that's right  always try to bring the fucking kid in  the oliver syndrome  yeah  yep  what are you gonna do  never works  all right so  steven tyler says his bandmates  oh this might be  all right  oh  steven tyler has a little 
[00:29:00]  oh good  we get to hear some of steven tyler's words of wisdom  yeah  no it's talking about his band  because you know there's been turmoil there  especially when you saw joe purry hip check him off the stage  yeah  i think joe purry knew that he was going to be signing with american idol and said well this is what i do to you now  yeah  with the band we've been married for 40 years remember and five guys um which makes it even worse than women and i could go for an hour and explain that but uh you know that first they were jealous um uh they heard it through the press and not through me but then i said to them four months ago you're looking for another lead singer so you know things go up and down i spent a stint 
[00:29:30]  stint in betty ford uh but you know as a band goes we live on the tail of a comet  and i've been on tour with these guys for 40 years and uh  wow  they've been judging me every day  and so you know sometimes it hurt  a lot of times  right  most times i came out through the wormhole  stronger  uh  you know um  so so  it's a real journey with those guys and 
[00:30:00]  and they would say the same about me  block block block  see listen to the  block block block  he's gotta try to be profound  doesn't  he didn't  he wasn't stronger when he came out the wormhole  i don't know  the wormhole  he was  he was bombing  yeah  bombing  he was hoping for big laughs  got none  five uh  five  got five guys  worse than women  i could talk about that for an hour  yeah  don't  he was bombed in 30 seconds 
[00:30:30]  but uh  and there was the other one that bombed too  he did another one that just got a zero  after 40 years don't you think you owe it to your band to tell them maybe  of course  shake up the phone and go hey man you know  you're gonna  this is gonna be all over the place  but i want you to know first  they heard it in the news  we should get joe perry  that's never good  uh  yeah let's get joe perry on today man  if we can i mean  that's a really good idea  i  bet he's not commenting on this  he might be  he's been yapping the whole time about stuff  yeah  yeah  someone wrote on twitter that he's uh 
[00:31:00]  on a flight to the philippines to find a new lead singer  doing the jerky thing  that's where they come from  yep  the new guys come from the philippines  and they'll work cheap too right  yeah  all right  per diem  uh  what else is going on  uh  earlier i was talking about um  blockbuster  oh they're going to buy it  they're filing for bankruptcy  and that's one of those companies that  um  10 years ago or so  you would never have thought  it would have gone bankrupt 
[00:31:30]  you'd be like wow  blockbuster  they're everywhere  they were on every fucking corner  and they started switching over to dvds  and you're like  oh cool  all right  they're getting out of the video  you know  vhs thing  they're going to dvds  so they're staying up to date  and now  done  just fucking  file for bankruptcy  it's a  it's a mistake that  a lot of companies  uh  make  they're way ahead of everybody else  and they just don't acknowledge the competition  they laugh at them 
[00:32:00]  and they don't  cable vision  they just  yeah  well you could go cable vision  you could go regular radio  you could go blockbuster  they've all made the same mistakes  you remember at new  we were sitting there doing uh  satellite radio live reads  yeah  and i was the one that  was yelling and screaming  through the live read  going this is the fucking competition  why are you taking money  from the competition  and i remember the big  shots back then  sitting us down going  don't worry  we don't have to worry  about satellite radio  yeah  and if  if they're willing  to give us money  we'll take it  continue with the live reads 
[00:32:30]  boys  fast forward a mere  not many years actually  no  and satellite radio  pretty much did some  major damage to regular radio  and opened up other things  blockbuster  you go with netflix  they  remember when netflix hit  when blockbuster  was still a strong company  people were looking at netflix  like that's a silly idea  what  what do you do  you mail away  and you get a  disc  and now you're telling me  netflix  what their stocks  at 130 or something  the share  150  150  49  something like that 
[00:33:00]  yeah  so  close to 150  but blockbuster  had a chance  to kind of  look around  and see what the competition  was trying to get done  and they had such a lead  they could have figured  some shit out  but decided not to  they also stream  on their website  but that name  netflix  sometimes you get a name  when netflix  right  the name  it's like xerox  or google  it's one of those names  that just  for some reason  it becomes associated  with the activity  sure but i remember  when netflix first hit  you're just like  it didn't matter  the name didn't matter  because you were just like  this is stupid  how much dan  blockbuster should have like 
[00:33:30]  you know paid closer attention  and now you got the same thing  happening with the cable channels  time warner is running  a great commercial  you think it's a pro time warner commercial  they're like  so uh  who's your uh  cable provider  oh time warner  and you're thinking  this is a rah rah  time warner uh  cable commercial  you know to protect  from files  and then it's  just a bunch of people  bashing how bad  time warner is  and i don't even know  who who's  what the commercial's for  well it's not time warner  doing it  of course not  well you said 
[00:34:00]  time warner's running  a commercial  well that  i'm sorry  he scared me  no no but  weird strategy  when it hits on tv  you think  oh there's a time warner  commercial  like what's your provider  and you think  it's going to be  yeah  a pro time warner  commercial  and man it  it turns  and it's everybody  trashing how bad  the service is  which we've been  talking about here  on our show  because opus building  is ahead of mind  by i think  i'm waiting  while  i was on the roof  of our building  and i see direct tv  fucking uh  dishes all over the place  why were you on the roof  uh the maintenance guy  i'm like  he's he was 
[00:34:30]  in the elevator with me  i'm like where are you going  he goes oh i'm going up  to the penthouses  i'm like really  can i go with you  i go i want to go  on the roof  he goes yeah  i'll take you on the roof  oh  and then we're up there  and he's like  tar beach  how close to the edge  did he get  right to the edge  in the i mean  and the sides  only up to your waist  it was creepy as hell  it's about 50 52 stories up  and uh  and then he's  and then he's looking around  like nervously  i'm like what's up  he goes oh there's a hawk  up here  i'm like what  and it's not a big space  where you can go out 
[00:35:00]  and and then he takes me  over to the side  and sure enough  there's just a  a pigeon carcass  he goes yeah  that's from the hawk  the hawk brings up  it's uh  it's you know  it's prey or whatever  so why was he nervous  because he's seen the hawk  i guess  oh they'll dive by me  i'm sure  and the nest is somewhere  up there  oh there's a nest  or wherever he fucking  hangs out  i don't know  i don't know the life  of a hawk  i just know that the hawk  likes to kind of you know  hang out on the top  of this building  that i live on  what a view  name for a while  hawk  that's right 
[00:35:30]  didn't stick on force  remember  no it didn't stick  right  we were calling him hawk  because he went to look  at those birds  yeah  hawk  that one didn't stick  it went back to fatso  yeah right away  uh  jordan writes when  when it first came out  netflix sucked a dick  that's what i'm talking about  they only had one or two  shipping centers  so they  so the turnaround was like  a fucking week  to get a new movie  yeah  but they figured it all out  figured it out  and now electronic delivery  is where it's at  right  and uh  blockbuster was never  able to catch on 
[00:36:00]  they were just sitting there  waiting for people  to come into their stores  and rent movies  oh  with their dumb late fees  look  and  and  this is relevant today  so blockbuster  going you know  bankrupt  and like i said  back when we used to  have to do live reads  for satellite radio  yeah  this goes back about  uh  wow 11 years  the competition is now  advertising on our show  coast to coast  so whether you're into  hip-hop  we have sales wars 
[00:36:30]  that work in this building  rock stars or stock cars  you'll hear more  no more  this is the competition  what i'm hooked on right now  this is the competition  you whores  wide variety of things  i've never heard before  i could drive all the way  to new york  never have to change the channel  it's easy to add  what are you doing this new year's 
[00:37:00]  what are you doing  what are you doing  what are you doing  somebody  that was a commercial  look man  i know  yeah  so what are you doing  this new year's eve  why don't you  i don't know  blah blah blah blah blah  do something  i remember that  this is the competition  i remember that  i warned regular radio  11 years ago  they didn't want to  listen to me man  i'm telling you  i'm a fucking genius  and i see this shit 
[00:37:30]  coming a mile away  but remember ken stevens  ah we're just gonna  take their money  that's all right  hey we win  they're paying top dollar  for those spots  we win  we get their money  great  fast forward  like i said  a mere  it's 11 years now  but at the time  probably only four years later  you know  it was major competition  for regular radio  right  yeah  dummies  fucking dummies  and now  regular radio  wow  you know we got  ken steven explaining  oh wait 
[00:38:00]  okay hold on  oh no  really  is this interesting  to anybody  it is to me  fuck everybody  we got to return  from break  we did a whole break  on xm  and then we end up  being the big  fucking get for those guys  back in 2004  anyway whatever  but  we're back with the  opian anthony show  boy  and it's official  we have a bunch of  whores that work  for this company  that's for sure  holy ass  uh we're running a spot  on the opian anthony show 
[00:38:30]  for satellite radio  yeah satellite radio  you know it's the new  uh  and no one has a  new range  problem with this  in this company  that's called the  competition  and they're advertising  during our show  telling people basically  that uh  they have another  option out there  that all over  like uh  no matter where you  drive you won't  lose the signal  they're talking about  all this great stuff  that uh  you don't get  uh by listening  to the very station  that's advertising it  who is  who uh 
[00:39:00]  gave the okay  to take that  bunch of whores  it's hard enough  to compete  in this day and age  in radio  and now  now they're just  going to run  spots for the  competition  on our show  and they have  no problem  with this  whatsoever  we so should have  been fired  way before we  were  just a bunch  of fucking  assholes  yes and no  you were right  though  that might not  have been the  best way to do  it but you  were right  yeah  look where we  are  as we play  this audio  I know  we're  it's on 
[00:39:30]  satellite radio  radio is really  it's really  getting pathetic  it's ridiculous  this used to be  a business  where every radio  station was for  themselves and  they just fought  literally fought  on the street  yeah we've done  that break  wait I wanted  to hear that  the fighting  on the street  yeah  did you really  yeah for a minute  why not  it's old style  I haven't heard  this stuff in years  radio is really  it's really  getting pathetic  it's ridiculous  yeah  this used to be  a business  where every radio  station was for  themselves and  they just fought  literally fought  on the street 
[00:40:00]  We used to get in fights because someone else's van was parked outside the venue for a concert.  Now all the stations are owned by the same person or the same company,  and they don't want you talking bad about this station or that station because you're going to hurt the company.  It's making radio so bland and boring.  Yeah.  And now on top of that, they don't mind taking advertising dollars from the competition.  Right.  They see no problem with this.  Holy shit. 
[00:40:30]  They don't see a problem with this?  Will there be cursing over this satellite radio?  Oh, you curse?  I want to gig over there.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  I want to gig over there.  You know.  I want to gig over there.  Regulated.  Good call, stupid.  I know.  Jesus.  I had to say I wanted to gig over there.  I want to be fired, and then I want to gig over there.  I know.  Yeah, we would curse on regular radio.  That was regular radio with the holy shit.  We knew we could get away with one.  What was it?  We kind of, like, knew we could curse once every month.  We would test the dump guy, too. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, right, right, right.  We would always test the dump guy.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  Or sometimes.  That probably didn't make it out onto the airwaves.  Sometimes when the dump guy would come back to just kind of say hi.  He'd look in, and we'd go like, hey, fuck.  And he'd go like, ah, and just run down the hall trying to get to his equipment and his  dump button.  Remember, do you remember, they always had a dump guy.  It was Al Dukes for a while, I guess, right?  Yeah.  And we would get so frustrated with what he was dumping out that we would, while the  stupid music was playing, we'd have these massive arguments. 
[00:41:30]  And then remember they got to a point where they actually locked him in so we weren't  allowed to talk to him anymore?  Yeah, they locked him in the room.  And I think it was Al Dukes for most of that run, he had to stay in this one, like, tiny  little closet for our entire show, was not allowed to leave, because he knew as soon as  he left that little closet, we would be in his face yelling and screaming about what he  dumped out.  Especially considering what got dumped out in 07 at K-Rock.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing what got dumped out then that we would complain about.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:42:00]  What do you mean you can't say pussy farts in the mouth?  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Communist?  Oh, yeah.  But you have to fight.  Right to the end, you gotta just keep fighting.  You always sound younger when I hear your old, I don't know, it's like I knew you then,  I was doing radio with you, but you still, I don't know why you sound, like, much younger.  I don't know.  And Ann, I didn't hear much of you, you might have through it then.  Nah, I feel like.  His voice hasn't changed that much.  But even at the beginning of XM, maybe it's just hearing things you just know when they're  from.  I don't know.  I just didn't feel like I was so beaten at that point.  Oh, my love.  I had this youthful exuberance and fucking just this want and need. 
[00:42:30]  Now I'm just a beaten fucking, a beaten old dog.  Oh, Gracie.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Chunky monkey, fucking obese primate.  Obese primate.  You made that move?  Yes.  They finally broke us, you think?  Are we broken finally?  Oh, we are fucking broken like rent string horses.  So then, um, so then Ken Stevens, God love Ken Stevens. 
[00:43:00]  I want to say hi to him.  He's somewhere in the, on the Chesapeake, Chesapeake Bay sailing.  To this day, he's just sailing around.  Yeah.  After we got him fired.  Uh, he was the GM and he came in cause we just went off on this stupid XM commercial  thing that we were forced to play on our show.  Yeah.  And, uh, Ken, the big boss at the time comes in to try to explain it.  Oh, okay.  He had no problem.  That always worked well.  Unlike these asses down the hall, he had no problem coming on our show and getting, and, 
[00:43:30]  and getting, you know, he would get beat up.  All of them.  So the question is, somebody said to me, you're wondering why we're taking these XM, uh, satellite  ads.  Very good.  You actually understood the question also, Ken Stevens.  Yes.  Why are we advertising for satellite radio an option to listening to this very program?  Pretend for a minute that you don't know anything.  Pretend for a minute.  Here, here, here it comes. 
[00:44:00]  Here it comes.  Pretend for a minute.  Love Ken, but here comes that corporate bullshit.  Yeah.  That we've heard so many times.  A minute that you don't know anything about the radio business and you're just the average  guy listening in your car to those XM radio spots.  Okay.  Do they make any sense to you?  Hold on.  Let me, let me.  Oh my God.  Listen to this.  If man were meant to fly, he'd have wings fucking excuse.  Right.  It's like.  That Ken's got.  What was the other one? 
[00:44:30]  Does it make any sense to you?  If man ever went over, what, 28, 28 miles an hour, he would.  If the velocity exceeds 30 miles an hour, he will surely perish.  Danny, could you get that list today?  Because this, this belongs on that list.  There's a whole list of things that people have said in history that was just not possible.  Wrong.  Okay.  Do they make any sense to you?  Hold on.  Let me, let me, let me put myself in there.  Here we go.  You asked us for a lot and you're not giving us time.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  I'm sitting. 
[00:45:00]  Opie, sit.  So you're saying advertising doesn't work and no one should advertise on radio.  Maybe it's your show.  No.  I think that if you listen to the commercials the way we're running them.  Yeah.  They're not awfully attractive.  Did you hear, they're not all, this is hysterical.  We got them so bad.  It pretty much, satellite radio and also the other things, the other options that came 
[00:45:30]  up to terrestrial radio, the, the, I, the iPod, all kinds of these other modern conveniences  for music destroyed regular radio.  Sure.  They just destroyed it.  So my, my point being back in 2001, I think it was, was why give them anything?  But Ken had it all figured out.  Keep them down.  It's a fad or it's, no one will even understand what this is.  Right.  Yes, don't worry.  The normal consumer, we're just taking their money and going, uh, look, blah, blah, blah, 
[00:46:00]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know how bad it is for the GM?  He's on our show basically saying how awful the spots are.  Yeah.  They don't make any sense.  And that's the last thing a GM ever wants to say, knowing that the client is probably  going to, you know, hear back.  Yeah.  What, what went on on the show that day?  Cable TV.  You know what?  You're sitting at home.  You got your aerial.  Right.  What do you need cable television for?  You want a cable running into your house? 
[00:46:30]  Do you know the layman really doesn't understand it, so he won't get it?  Right.  Really, Ken?  Really?  An automobile?  We have a horse and a carriage.  Why would you want something like an automobile?  We were, I think, no, we were.  We were so brilliant.  We actually had the GM come on and basically admit that advertising doesn't work.  Advertising doesn't work.  And just listening to his hindsight here, the hindsight of Ken Stevens talking about a new medium and getting it completely wrong is great. 
[00:47:00]  Like I said, I mean, it's 11 years now, but only a few years after this, XM was on the map.  This is hysterical because as you listen to this, both us and Howard were both working for Infinity Broadcasting, Viacom.  Howard was just killing in mornings, obviously.  We weren't doing too bad ourselves in afternoons.  And now we're both working for the company that Ken said was nothing. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  It's just a fact.  Don't even worry about it.  I think that if you listen to the commercials the way we're running them, they're not awfully attractive.  Did you hear the one line?  How many of your friends are going to go out and spend whatever, what does it say?  On, on, on, now insert color TV here, insert radio here, insert car here, where he is going to say, are you going to buy this right now?  I don't know.  Insert Xbox instead of PlayStation.  Right.  Insert any new technology. 
[00:48:00]  Ken, did you hear the one part in that commercial where he says, boy, I could drive through New York and I don't have to change the station?  No, I heard the one where he said, and my favorite is the Blues Channel.  Right.  I'm not really worried about losing a whole lot of audience to the Blues Channel.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  This is what we got to deal with.  That's why Ken's on a ship somewhere.  Look, let's bring it back to current day.  That's why those fucking assholes down the hall and upstairs have got to continue listening to us. 
[00:48:30]  We know.  You don't.  VHS tapes will always be king.  The DVD?  I mean, who wants a disc?  It looks like a little silver pizza.  Nobody wants that.  No one wants that.  Wi-Fi?  What's that?  Oh, stop.  You don't need that.  Do you have any of your friends using Wi-Fi?  No.  The dial-up is totally fine.  The dial-up is king.  Why am I going with a cable modem?  What is this? 
[00:49:00]  I don't need that.  I have a little thing that I plug into my, I have a dongle, I have a dongle that I plug my phone line into.  See, I know the guys down the hall really want us to listen to them.  This is why we don't.  Yes.  We just know way more than you.  We have quite a track record with things like this.  Of course.  This is only one example, by the way.  Just one stupid little example of how smart we really are.  God, I love this.  I got to hear more, Ken.  Sure.  I'm not really worried about losing a whole lot of audience to the blues, Ken. 
[00:49:30]  Well, not, Ken.  Wow, you guys.  When those ratings come out and they're down, who will be getting yelled at?  Hey, you know what?  If your ratings are down and your audience has moved over to satellite radio, I'll stop taking those commercials.  Yeah, but it's a little here, a little there.  It adds up after a while.  I'll stop taking those commercials.  But that's a great point because in the end, when the ratings came out and we were down like one-tenth of a point,  there was a panic setting in.  Like, uh-oh, where are you trending? 
[00:50:00]  What happened?  Yeah, exactly.  They got other options now.  Right.  Right.  And do you know that it's going to be an option on all new model cars?  Let me ask you something.  This is great.  I love it.  It's like it's going to be an option.  And then he's like, let me ask you something.  All right.  I can't wait to hear what Ken asked us back then.  I can't wait.  I can't wait because now we all know that it's an option in pretty much every new car. 
[00:50:30]  Just about every new car has an XM Sirius option.  This is like cracking open a retard time capsule.  Let me ask you something.  All cocky.  Let's see what Ken wants to ask us.  You guys are just stupid DJs.  I'm all-knowing.  Here it is, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Top 30 failed technology predictions.  Well, some of these are pretty bad.  Yeah, I'm trying to find the good one.  Oh, the horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty. 
[00:51:00]  A fad.  A fad.  Of course.  That was the president of the Michigan Savings Bank advising Henry Ford's lawyer, Horace Rackham,  not to invest in the Ford Motor Company back in 1903.  Yeah.  Right.  You know what Erasmus Wilson said?  When the Paris exhibition of 1878 closes, electric light will close with it, and no more will be heard of it.  Electric light. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  That's Ken Stevens, great-grandfather.  So before he goes with the let me ask you something, I want to read a few more of these.  Here's one.  Araki will never be able to leave the Earth's atmosphere.  No, of course not.  New York Times, 1936.  Here's one.  There will never be a bigger plane built.  A Boeing engineer, after the first flight of the 247, twin engine that holds ten people.  That's great.  Oh, here you go.  The cinema is little more than a fad. 
[00:52:00]  It's canned drama.  What audiences really want to see is flesh and blood on the stage.  The world potential market for copying machines is 5,000 at most.  That was IBM to the eventual founders of Xerox.  Oh, here you go.  Saying the photocopier had no market large enough to justify production.  Could you go with 16?  This is great.  You got to do it to the mega. 
[00:52:30]  It's way better.  Ah.  Let me look at it.  Let me look at it.  Let me look at it.  Let me look at it.  Ah, it certainly is.  Let him do it with the old e-time voice.  Ah.  Yes.  The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not.  We have plenty of messenger boys.  Yeah.  That's Sir William Pierce, Chief Engineer, British Post Office, 1878.  Yeah, the stupid phone, right?  That's not going to catch up.  Telephone stinks. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, go with 17.  That's good, too.  About the telephone.  Oh, yes.  This telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.  The device is inherently of no value to us.  A memo at Western Union.  Yeah, no one's using their phone now to communicate.  The cinema is little more than a fad.  It's canned drama.  Oh, you got that one.  Sorry. 
[00:53:30]  Number 25 is good, too.  Ah, yes.  Let me see that one.  Television won't last.  It's a flash in the pan.  Mary Somerville, pioneer of radio educational broadcast.  Another dummy in radio.  Again, Steve.  That's again.  Go with 20.  Ah.  X-rays will prove to be a hoax.  A hoax.  These fucking idiots.  They didn't believe in the submarine. 
[00:54:00]  No.  I must confess that my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but  suffocating its crew and floundering at sea.  Folding around with alternating current is just a waste of time.  No one will use it.  The big Thomas Edison fight.  Even he was, uh...  With the Tesla.  Wow, what dummies.  The wireless music box has no imaginable commercial value. 
[00:54:30]  Who would pay for a message sent to no one in particular?  The what has no value?  The what has no value?  I missed that.  The wireless music box.  It must be some type of radio.  Yeah.  It was some guy responding to a letter to call for investment in the radio in 1921.  Who's going to pay for a message sent to no one in particular? 
[00:55:00]  This is a good one, too.  Look for number 22.  22?  But it's French.  Ah, yes.  It's Napoleon.  Ah, how, sir, would you make a ship sail against the wind and currents by lighting a bonfire  under her deck?  I pray you excuse me.  I have not the time to listen to such nonsense.  That was Napoleon Bonaparte when told of Robert Fulton's steamboat.  Jesus.  Isn't it really amazing how politely he told him to go, fuck his mother? 
[00:55:30]  I don't have time for such nonsense.  They really had this eloquent way of saying, you're full of horse shit.  Yeah, you suck.  Oh, go with 28.  Please.  I know it's long.  Ah, let's see.  Dear Mr. President, the canal system of this country is being threatened by new forms of  transportation known as railroads.  As you may well know, Mr. President, railroad carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 
[00:56:00]  15 miles per hour by engines, which in addition to endangering life and limb of passengers,  roar and snort their way through the countryside, setting fire to crops, scaring livestock and  frightening the women and children, the almighty certainly never intended that people travel  at such breakneck speeds.  How much would you love to stick him on the Concorde?  Yeah, right.  Yeah, dunce.  15 miles an hour. 
[00:56:30]  Unbelievable.  It's a long list.  It's all relative, though, because the way we travel a thousand miles an hour in the Concorde  or 600 or 500 on a plane, a hundred years from now, when they break the new one, they'll  be going, look at these clowns.  We leave the atmosphere.  We're in L.A. in 12 minutes.  Oh, that's why, you know.  And you'll be complaining like, fuck it.  God damn, man.  15 minutes.  It's late.  That's why you got to always have an open mind as big as your imagination.  Imagination.  Imagine that. 
[00:57:00]  So here's Ken Stevens.  Ken explaining.  Going back about 10, 11 years.  11 years, I guess.  What was the setup to this one?  Wait, what year are we up to?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  It's only nine years ago.  Nine.  Nine years.  Only nine years.  2001 ago, we could never conceive of such things.  Suction for saliva.  To get it out of your mouth.  That just drips down your lower lip. 
[00:57:30]  If you're just tuning in, we had commercials running for XM Satellite Radio on our regular  radio show.  Yeah.  And we were fucking losing our minds.  Like, this is insane.  It's a competition.  Why would you even give them an inch, keep them down?  And the GM at the time, Ken Stevens, who we love.  I still love the guy.  Ken's great, but boy.  He was trying to explain why they were taking satellite radio ads on regular radio.  And here he is in the middle of discussing that with us back in 2001. 
[00:58:00]  And do you know that it's going to be an option on all new model cars?  Let me ask you something.  Yeah.  You got that newfangled cable or satellite in your house?  You need money this bad, Ken.  With all those music channels on there?  You want us to give some of the money back?  Yeah.  Including the Blues Channel?  I think it's great, as a matter of fact.  And if you look at broadcast TV, the ratings down pretty low because of cable.  Answer my question.  Yeah, I do.  So when you're sort of walking around the house, instead of turning on the radio, you 
[00:58:30]  turn on channel 956 and listen to the Blues Channel or the Kids Channel?  I believe there's enough people that do it that chip away.  Hold on.  Here's what I listen to at my house.  I haven't turned on terrestrial radio in my house or car in fucking years.  So when he's talking about this, it's like, oh, so you're going to go to channel 900 something?  Let me tell you, I do.  I put on the music channels on my cable system when I'm walking around the house. 
[00:59:00]  Or I use my Sonos system, which I can get serious satellite radio on.  I play lithium out back.  I could listen to Ron and Fez inside when I get home.  So, yes, I am listening to it in my house.  I'm not listening to regular radio.  He didn't see the ability.  None of them did to categorize your music choices and just go, I want rock.  Rock stations come up or have a favorites list. 
[00:59:30]  We just go, blue channel, and you're done.  There you are.  You don't know what channel it is.  You just hit it on your favorites.  I'm babbling.  I mean, Ken is getting a beating here, but this is normal thinking in corporate America.  This was the problem.  And that's why this all started with Blockbuster not seeing the competition when they had a chance to keep everyone down.  Right.  You know, they had the market.  They had the entire market at the time.  And this is exactly what happened to radio.  You're listening.  This is amazing because this should be in the fucking, in the broadcast museum, this clip, to show how fucked management was and just the industry at not seeing the future. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  Ken wasn't the only one thinking this.  No, no.  It was worse.  They were all laughing at satellite radio.  We'll deal with them eventually.  He had to defend it because it was on the air and he had to defend it against what you're saying.  Yeah, he was being a good soldier right up until they booted his ass out the door.  I believe there's enough people that do it that chip away. 
[01:00:30]  There's my TV and there's my radio, though.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I'm not watching TV in my car.  Why assume all this, Ken?  Do we need the money that bad?  Yeah.  Why don't we just list all the shows that are on opposite us because that's what you just did.  You're killing us.  You know, I took out the one where XM wanted to run the spot that said you were boring.  I didn't run that one.  Really?  Yeah.  No, I stuck to the one that said Blue's Channel.  The company has no problem with this?  I guess not.  Must have been a big buy. 
[01:01:00]  Must have been here.  It wasn't a dissident rate.  Well, they probably will now that you've made an issue out of it.  Uh-oh.  It was supposed to be under the radar.  Oh, yeah.  Because our listeners are stupid.  And this thing is something that Ken has dubbed newfangled.  Newfangled.  So I don't think it'll take off.  I don't think you guys were paying attention, but that's okay.  Oh, God.  All right, Ken.  Well, thank you.  That wasn't what I said.  Thank you for clearing that up for us.  I mean, if you're really certain that you're losing listeners to that Blues channel on satellite radio, I'll stop taking the commercials. 
[01:01:30]  See, he picked a channel that he would think is very niche.  Right, right, right.  Which it is.  But at the time, they already had sports going on.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, rock stations, of course.  He didn't see Bob Edwards coming.  No, he didn't.  Bob Edwards.  There's one more clip off this disc.  It says, could ONA go to satellite?  I guess we got to play that.  We have to play that. 
[01:02:00]  As we sit here on satellite radio now.  Come on, come on.  From 2001.  There was a day when sales didn't control radio, Anthony.  It now controls it.  I remember a time that they would fight with the competition.  But now they welcome the business of the competition on their airwaves.  Let's see.  Hundreds of distortion-free channels that travel with you being offered in high-end cars driven by decision makers.  Ken's right.  It'll never catch on.  See, that's why.  Do you understand what I'm saying here today? 
[01:02:30]  Visionary.  In 2010?  Visionary.  We're visionaries.  We really are.  That's why we can't listen to anybody.  Oh, that's true.  Because they're very closed-minded in their thinking.  Of course.  In your voice, you're like, I can hear it.  You're like, fuck, this sounds really good.  Yeah.  Nice to see I was contributing.  What a faggot.  Just sat there so Ken wouldn't yell at me.  You were the smart one.  You know?  Unbelievable.  Cars driven by decision makers.  Ken's right.  It'll never catch on. 
[01:03:00]  You know, guys, I'll be doing a gig tonight.  Of course.  Of course, Jimmy.  I didn't know that I chimed in there.  Of course.  Jimmy chimes in with a plug.  Of course.  Of course he does.  Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.  Oh, shit.  That's perfect.  Plug, plug, plug, plug, plug, plug.  Oh, dude.  What timing?  For me to just say that.  That was a complete coincidence.  I didn't realize I spot you when I was there that day.  Oh, that's great.  Let's get to the business of the gig.  Danny just wrote, I can't wait to hear this break in 10 years on Pandora.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why they should be paying us what we want. 
[01:03:30]  Because it's important to keep, you know, content.  You can get music anywhere at this point.  Everyone knows it.  That blues channel you're talking about?  Ken.  Pandora's box.  That's a fud.  Ken's right.  It'll never catch on.  You know, guys, I'll be doing a gig tonight.  But, you know, I don't want to talk about it.  Let's plug Rich Voss.  I wonder if, at some point, they'll make deals with people like us to carry our show. 
[01:04:00]  I've got to stop again.  See, you've got to keep your mind open.  I wonder.  I wonder, as we just sit here.  Right.  Meanwhile, the deal was the opposite.  Terrestrial Radio made the deal to carry you from here.  From here.  Who saw that coming?  Yeah.  I did.  us to carry our show if people want that as an alternative no matter where they drive.  But then it says, okay, what about if you're driving through an area that we're on at a regular radio station 
[01:04:30]  and you can get it on satellite, where's the revenue coming from?  It just throws a whole bunch of things.  Following the logic of this, I'm just assuming that this great company of ours is buying satellite radio.  Well, you know something.  And they're jumping the gun.  It makes sense.  But you know what?  Get it up there and then buy it.  They're probably not buying satellite radio.  No?  But instead, they're running ads for the competition.  And no one sees anything wrong with that.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, guys, what's happening? 
[01:05:00]  Hey.  Hey, listen, I just wanted to know, can you repeat everything?  You said I lost the signal, man.  That's classic, you dick.  Very good.  Wow, that really speaks volumes.  Isn't that unbelievable?  It's amazing.  I wonder what the gig was.  God, we're like Nostradamus.  Well, maybe not.  Certain things you didn't see coming?  No, that's for sure.  Dummies.  God damn. 
[01:05:30]  This is even Tyler.  Enough.  Why, man?  This is big news.  These two women.  He looks like a lady in Beverly Hills.  Who's had the whole trout phase thing.  It's just an amazing thing to be part of.  I feel really lucky to be here.  And I'm really excited to see, you know, who we find.  I've had 40 years to experience that myself.  And there's an old saying, spot it, you got it. 
[01:06:00]  What?  People have said, I got it.  These are two legendary artists now in their own right.  So I think every kid here auditioning,  we used to say this every season when they would come on the show and be mentors.  Every kid is trying to hopefully be them at some point in their lifetime.  I mean, this is the real deal.  Tyler looks like shit.  Hey guys.  Along with the new judges, there are also some format changes.  Gone are the celebrity guest judges and themed shows,  where singers were forced to focus on specific styles such as R&B, country, or even the Beatles. 
[01:06:30]  Instead, executive producer Nigel Lithgow says,  contestants will be urged to stick with the genre that they sing best.  We'll see if it works.  Oh my goodness.  Zach, I can throw a rent.  You got this new mentor also, Jimmy Iovine, right?  He's like a record producer.  He's an expert.  I think it's great.  These guys are New Yorkers, by the way.  J-Lo from the Bronx.  Steve Tyler is from Westchester, Yonkers.  And they both know the business.  Don't be fooled by how good she looks.  Who's Jenny from the block?  Jenny from the block.  She looked good, right?  She had that glitter jumpsuit on. 
[01:07:00]  Shut up.  I know.  I was meaning just to see her fashion.  How about that?  That sounds great, Julie.  For me, it's about the music.  You want the contestants, yeah.  Thanks so much.  Come on.  All right.  Let's get to check on the weather right now.  Mike Woods, what's happening?  Clear blue skies.  Clear blue skies.  I want to get a break.  You should take a shit in my mouth.  J-Lo's got a big ass.  Juicy dumper.  That has seen a lot of... 
[01:07:30]  She's Jenny on my cock.  Mark Anthony is unclipped.  And I know in my mind, I sound more like him than I really do.  But I don't care.  It's fun to do.  It is a lot of fun.  I do it all the time.  Whenever the weather comes on now, I just can't get the bright blue skies.  He is a fucking classic.  All the time.  Gotta love Ira.  Where's Mars?  My phone's went tiny. 
[01:08:00]  The phones went tiny.  Oh, the phones went tiny?  What's that mean?  I have no idea.  Like the little phone thing that got all small on the computer screen.  Went tiny and then you don't know what anyone's talking about.  Why would you possibly need a screen bigger than 13 inches?  Here we go.  We got a little O&A theater as we go to break.  Who's coming in today?  I know Jimmy's leaving for Marco Island, right?  Yes.  I'll be there tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  I leave in about a half hour to go to the airport.  I have to. 
[01:08:30]  Daddy has to work.  Daddy has to make a living.  We got Joe DeRosa coming in today, and we also have a Danny McBride phone call.  Awesome.  I saw the first episode of Eastbound and Down.  Yeah.  Fucking great.  Fucking great.  That show is coming back to HBO finally after almost a year and a half.  Is it that long it's been off?  Yeah, March.  HBO is so bizarre with that.  March 2009 was the last episode.  God damn it, dude.  That's 18 months, but yet it's season two. 
[01:09:00]  I know.  That's crazy.  What are you thinking?  I don't know what happened with that.  I guess Danny McBride got way too famous or something.  The TV, it's amazing how these seasons change.  Like some places they'll go season three, and it's been on for a year.  Right.  And now it's season two is two years later.  It's so weird.  Yeah, they just throw them out there whenever they want.  Call it a season.  HBO really does, yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  But we got a little theater, O&A Theater, as we go to break.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents O&A Theater.  Tonight's performance, Ray J. Johnson, Jr., portrayed by James Norton. 
[01:09:30]  And action.  Hey, Johnson.  Ah!  This has been O&A Theater.  Thank you, and have a pleasant evening.  Opie and Anthony Show on the Virus Series XM.  I'm down to earth like this, rocking this business. 
[01:10:00]  I've grown up so much.  I'm in control and loving it.  Rumors got me laughing, kid.  I love my life and my public.  Put God first and can't forget to stay in the way.  Who's not dancing to this?  I challenge you. 
[01:10:30]  Boo!  I'm still dreaming from the back.  Day.  Day.  That's how I was in this.  Day.  What's your name, fat buddy?  Oh, no.  Because you are a disgusting somebody from  I'm scared  In person  In person  In person  In person  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him

Yeah, I had that thing 
[01:12:00]  Oh boy, that's not going to take off  No, no, I will  It's like a dock  But it's just like a USB thing  Who would do that?  That's stupid  Yeah  That's just stupid talk  That is true  That is true  Your blues channel  What?  Blues channel  Yeah  That's what the satellite radio people are like  Fucking  You better keep fucking content  That is live  Not that the music channels aren't great  But come on  But everyone else is catching up as far as music goes  Let's  We all see it  So  What is it?  Yeah  We have to be company guys  And make believe it's not happening 
[01:12:30]  It is happening  So let me say it for everyone  So don't make  We want raisins  That's right  Don't make the same mistakes everybody else did before us  With all these companies  Anyway, go ahead  She was looking through my iPod song list  My artists  And she wasn't even kidding  When she was scrolling  She went  You're a faggot  She totally meant it  You do have some gay things on there  Oh, fuck, man  What did she want to spit in my face?  Shani from the block you got on there  I have a little bit of Dixie Chicks  Don't you got Betty Davis eyes? 
[01:13:00]  Who doesn't?  Oh, God  Betty Davis eyes  Yay  Betty Davis eyes  They were blue  Very blue  Blue  Yes  Beautiful  Clear blue  Skies  Yeah  Yeah, you got a rough one, man  Ah, there's some guilty pleasures  We all have the guilty pleasures 
[01:13:30]  You have a lot of them, though, Jimmy  I know  I know  Balance it out  You have a lot of guilt  Most of us  A little guilt  More guilt than pleasure  Right  On yours  Right  Yeah, a lot of them are  Hey, uh  It's all bullshit  Everything is all bullshit  Man  What?  Everything you know is bullshit  We go back to 1980  Why not  Let's stay in the time machine for a little while  Yeah, I like the time machine  We go back to 1980 for this 
[01:14:00]  Listen closely  Okay  You know, I used to serve fast food as a treat  But now fast food is more than a once in a while thing  That's why I serve Kentucky Fried Chicken more and more  The kids love it and I know they're eating well  It's made  They're eating well  What did you serve before?  She used to just inject lard into their hearts  Everything you know is bullshit  It was a needle of lard in the heart and an AIDS chaser  That's what they had before  An AIDS chaser  Thank God for Kentucky Fried Chicken 
[01:14:30]  See, fast food every once in a while  Because, you know  But KFC is healthy  So now we eat it a lot  Kentucky Fried Chicken  Right  It's Kentucky Fried Chicken  All right, before they get it  Yeah  Kentucky Fried Chicken more and more  The kids love it and I know they're eating well  It's made from the highest quality chicken  Cooked with the Colonel's finger-licking good recipe  Of 11 herbs and spices  It's so nice  You know  It is nice to feel so good about a meal here  So good about Kentucky Fried Chicken 
[01:15:00]  I remember that one  Now the fucking  You fast forward to 2010  And the commercials  All look like fucking Katrina footage  Yeah  Yeah, look at the little blonde girl  Enjoying some Kentucky Fried Chicken  Yeah, Danny had brought up the actual commercial on YouTube  And not a black person to be found in that commercial  It's the purest family you can imagine  Imagine  I haven't seen one Negro  Not one ducky 
[01:15:30]  In the entire commercial  Fast forward 30 years  I bet you half these kids had quadruple bypass  Oh yeah  You know  If they're even alive  If they're even alive  Down their chest  Right  Just have their ribs cracked open  To get a  Fucking original recipe dust comes out  To get all that goodness out of them  So they can live a few more years  The McDonald's commercials were the same way too  Many, many years ago  Yeah  Yeah, it was a bunch of white people  Just singing and dancing around the McDonald's 
[01:16:00]  So good  So good is everywhere  So good  And while no one knows exactly where it started  For 70 years there's been only one way to describe the world's best chicken  So good  So good  It's so good  Help KFC celebrate 70 years  Get four free pieces of original recipe chicken with the purchase  And now they just go with so good  Because no one's going to deny that  Fucking KFC, Popeyes  You name it  It's amazing  It was good  And so bad for you 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, but they're not still saying that it's healthy for you  Yeah, that's  Healthy  As a mother she felt good  Right  About giving her kids a healthy meal  Of fried chicken  What do they all have a smoke after dinner too?  Yeah, then they light up a lucky  What the fuck?  It's great  That's not good  I love looking at old commercials like that  Yeah  Old cigarette commercials  A smooth pull  Do I like a smooth pull? 
[01:17:00]  Get it?  Jerk off joke  I actually didn't get it  Well, you did now  This is good  When the big fish is hooked  And you finally land him  Reward yourself with the pleasure of smooth smoking  Smoke longer and finer and milder pell-mell  Pell-mell is longer, yes 
[01:17:30]  But greater length is only half the story  Fine tobacco is its own best filter  And pell-mell tobaccos are the finest quality money can buy  And look how pell-mell's greater length travels the smoke further  Filters the smoke naturally and makes it mild  Right  In fact, your appreciation of pell-mell quality  Has made it America's most successful and most imitated cigarette  It's your cigarette  Fine tobacco blended to a flavor peak  Distinctively pell-mell 
[01:18:00]  So reward yourself with the smoothness, mildness, and satisfaction  No other cigarette can offer you  She's loving that cigarette  Five pell-mell famous cigarettes  Outstanding  Reward yourself  And they are mild  With cancer  Mild  Why was that ever called pell-mell?  It's pall-mell, right?  Everyone was like, hey, I don't like mopping a cigarette off  All right, she's  All right  Old lady just smokes the pall-mall  It's the same reason they call a jaguar a jaguar 
[01:18:30]  It makes it sound more attractive  Jaguar  That's how the limeys say it  Pell-mell  Spelled pall-mall, dummy  That's right  That was from 1955  Boy, did they love their fucking cigarettes, huh?  I'd love to see  I guarantee you she had a fucking beach ball taken out from underneath her gums  Half her jaw  She's so Roger Ebert  Not that he smoked, but  I don't know  Did he? No?  He didn't smoke  I don't know if he did or not  I don't know  All right, well 
[01:19:00]  Like I said, it's all bullshit  My thing is, what are they telling us now?  That we'll know is bullshit  That is complete bullshit  Because nothing has changed  I don't think much has changed  I still think they're just telling us lies  Lies!  All over the place  It's a bunch of lies  It's all a bunch of lies  Hey, you know Alex Jones?  Yes  Of course you do  Conspiracy guy  We had him on the show  Yeah, we had a good time with him  His whole conspiracy thing  Kind of fell apart  Right in front of our eyes, right? 
[01:19:30]  Alex Jones  Parts of it, yeah  Parts of it, sure  Yes  The banking stuff  I tend to believe a lot more  Because I think that people  Are much more comfortable  Stealing money  Yeah  Than they are just taking  Planeloads of civilians  And murdering them  Uh-huh  Right  Meaning our government  I think the banking stuff  I believe  Todd and PA  Check out Chinese yellow commercial  What?  Chinese yellow commercial?  Did he mean jello?  I have no idea  Or Chinese yellow jello commercial? 
[01:20:00]  Or yellow?  This is going to be another listener contribution  Alright, you're right  I'm just saying  That will probably not pan out  What about Alex Jones?  Yeah, we'll go to Alex Jones  If Danny finds that  And if it's worth playing  We'll play it  But first this  From Alex Jones  But the reason  There's so many gay people now  Is because it's a chemical warfare operation  I have the government documents  Where they said  They're going to encourage homosexuality  With chemicals  So that people don't have children  I look like a man cow  Holy shit  Yeah, well  It's that man cow voice 
[01:20:30]  Well, we did that bit too  All the radio guys  Had the same voice  Very similar  There's a whole bunch of them  They just for some reason  Don't want to use their real voices  On the radio  I never understood that  Why wouldn't you want to  Just talk in your regular voice?  Yeah  What, the government's  Making people gay?  No, they're not  People just love dick and pussy  The government is making people gay  More people are just living  Their lives as gay people  Because they know  They're not going to get  Beat up as much  Exactly  Simple as that 
[01:21:00]  That's what that's about  Silly  That's  That's  It's more acceptance  That's craziness  The reason there's so many gay people now  Is because it's a chemical warfare operation  I have the government documents  Where they said  They're going to encourage homosexuality  With chemicals  So that people don't have children  I even catch myself, Bob  Drinking out of these estrogen mimickers  And they'll probably say it  If it's longer  He can't believe this, right?  Is this his shtick?  I mean  It's got to be his shtick  What document?  When he wouldn't name the person 
[01:21:30]  Right  Who was agreeing to  Whatever  I forget what the situation was  But he wouldn't name them  And say  Well, if you're for the greater good  Then you would  Then you're  That person  And you having an honorable agreement  Is less important than the greater good  Which is helping people  Right  But I don't remember what it was  There's more gay people  Because of Harvey Milk  Everyone knows it  Ah  He wanted to recruit you  He recruited a lot of people  I'm Harvey Milk  And I want to recruit you  Cool  There's more gay people  I'll say it again 
[01:22:00]  Because of acceptance  That's all  Simple as that  I don't think there's any more gay people  There are always about the same amount of gay people  But it looks like there's more gay people  Because of the acceptance of it  Thank you  Back then  Back then  They didn't come out  Right  They were hiding  They were very scared  Who are you?  What's your name, madam?  What's your name?  Are you an intern?  Yeah  We haven't met you yet, Heather  My name's Heather, hi  Hi, Heather  Nice to meet you  You didn't poison the coffee, did you?  Oh, damn  Not today  Well, I mean  No, not today  Oh, that means  One day 
[01:22:30]  Could happen  That was a good line  Sure  All right, bye  She just walks out  She's scared of us  Wow, she's all about  All about work  All about business  She should have stood here  Taking her beating  All right, let's continue with Alex Jones  Drinking out of these estrogen mimickers  I can probably say it  If it's lined with it  Inside the plastic packaging  Oh, I wonder if this spring water  Natural lime flavor I'm drinking  I know full well  H-E-B's putting fluoride in this  Why am I drinking this? 
[01:23:00]  I know full well  These kettle chips  Say that they don't have MSG  But they've got the yeast extract thing  That says it's MSG  What's wrong with us?  Why won't we stop?  Why am I so weak?  And they know  They have immersed us in this, Bob  For those watching on PrisonPlanet.tv  Here's the inside of this juice box  And if they zoom in anymore  See that thin plastic?  It's got it  And I'm letting my children  Drink this  Why?  Because after you're done 
[01:23:30]  Drinking your little juices  He's crazy  I mean, you're ready to go out  And have a baby  What?  You're ready to put makeup on  You're ready to wear a short skirt  What?  You're ready to go, you know  Put together a garden of roses or something  You're ready to put lipstick on  I like it then  Sounds good to me  What is he talking about?  I thank you  What is he doing?  I don't know  Do you drink too much tap  Fucking bottled water?  Then what happens?  You blow your friends?  Yeah, and if you  With lipstick on?  Eat out of  Drink out of those juice containers 
[01:24:00]  The plastic liner on the inside  Turns you into a whore  At a younger age  Oh  Yeah  I hope that's true  I know  I'm not thirsty  Yes, you are  Drink up  What?  Slut  Holy shit  Did you write this?  Oh my god  The whole time I thought this said  Ready?  Alex Jones says  Justin Bieber is making kids gay  I swear to god  I was about to say  Where was the Justin Bieber part? 
[01:24:30]  What did it say?  It says juice boxes  Oh, Justin has juice boxes  And you know  As I look at this  It's obviously juice boxes  It's not even bad  But it's Justin Bieber  I saw  Alex Jones says  Justin Bieber  Making kids gay  So you know what it is?  He's not doing that show  Until today  Okay  So I was like  That's nonsense  Juice boxes do make you gay  But it's just because  You look like a little faggot  Drinking one  It's like  You have a cup  Pussy boy  You're doing 
[01:25:00]  I don't know  Spill it  I don't know  A little straw in there  Yeah  Exactly  That's what it is  You think the government's doing shit like that on purpose  Or do you think that maybe  Like to keep our stuff fresher  And what not  There's other things going on  Why would they say  With the hormones  And the chemicals they're using  They corset it  Let's make them all gay  Like what nonsense  Like what meeting was that?  Like alright look  We have problems with the economy  We have problems over in the Middle East  How can we get everybody in the country  To start sucking dick?  Doesn't make sense 
[01:25:30]  What's the upside there?  There isn't one  Wouldn't it be easier just to  I don't get it  Drop a few bombs on ourselves?  Yeah like  Then why would the government  Go through all this  To make people gay  So they don't have as many kids?  You stop giving these people  So much credit  Like there's this vast  These ten people that are amazing  And that don't get fucking warts  Or rectal itch  Or fucking have bed bugs  I'm tired of it  Gay  You know  Girls are reaching puberty  A lot younger  For sure  But are we doing that on purpose?  Or if it's a side effect  Of all the chemicals 
[01:26:00]  And hormones we're using  But are they reaching puberty  A lot younger?  I mean  When they lived to be 30  Or 35 in the Roman times  And that's not bullshit  Whatever it was  When were they reaching puberty  When they were 19?  Come on  No  Oh  So that's bullshit  I don't believe that  Like I said  It's all bullshit  Language  Man  And then people just buy into it  Bill in PA  Bill  Oh Bill  Yeah gentlemen 
[01:26:30]  Yeah the chemicals  That they put in the plastic  That hard in the plastic  Mimics estrogen  The same way  It's like a birth control pill  Mimics the woman being pregnant  So she doesn't become pregnant  That's what he's talking about  There's thousands of studies  Out there about it  But my question is  We're not doing it on purpose  I mean not my question  That's what I'm saying  Well if it mimics estrogen  Who cares?  Mimics  The government's not doing it  On purpose  To make a gay society  No  Not a gay society 
[01:27:00]  But if they  If they know a poison deal  Why are you still using it?  A gay society  Why are they still using it?  Because economically  It makes more sense  To continue using it  Yeah it must work  For something  Right  That they need  There's actually  Cheaper ways to hide  In the plastic  Are there?  Are you Mr. Plastic  Fucking guy?  No you just  I'm telling you  You just look at the  Look at the studies  And stuff like that  How do you know  There's cheaper ways  Of producing it?  Because when they  Started using it  About 40 years ago  That was the one  That they decided to use 
[01:27:30]  And there was other ways  To do it  That was cheaper to produce it  How do you know that?  From reading  You gotta pick up  A book sometimes gentlemen  But also because  They said it 40 years ago  Look at the break  We just did about  How people don't have  Foresight  You know when you  Look at what they said  40 years ago  About technology  Or things  So that somebody  Did a stupid thing  Maybe they thought  It wouldn't be  Cost effective in the  Long run for whatever  Reason  Show me a 40 year old  Juice box  Dummy  Well why do they  Still use inoculations  On children  That have 10 to 15 times 
[01:28:00]  The military level  Which should be  In a first shot  Which the  Center for Disease Control  Says is safe  So why are they doing that?  Yeah why do you think  They're doing it?  I have no idea  Why they're doing it  But they're still doing it  I don't know why  Well has there been  A polio outbreak recently  Or maybe they're doing that  So you don't get  Certain diseases  Why else would they do it?  No well they're using it  For them  Put the mercury in it  To keep the stuff stable  And stuff like that  On the shelf  And have a longer shelf life  Okay  I don't know why 
[01:28:30]  They're doing it  I'm just saying  I'm just saying the facts  Just gotta know anything  And facts  Ah they're facts  Okay  So what's the downside  More mercury  Or polio  Yeah  What would you like  A bunch of fucking  Ratso Rizzo's  Gimping around  They eradicated polio  In the United States  By using the inoculation  But it's come  You know  It's still a third world country  What?  Yeah  Right  Because they didn't 
[01:29:00]  Use the inoculation  Okay  I mean that's fine  When you can eradicate something  But in most  In most cases  It doesn't  They infect you  With the disease  And doesn't it teach your body  How to fight the disease  And that's why  You don't get it?  Yes  Okay  I'm not saying that it's bad  I'm just saying  I'm just saying facts  Of the things  Like he's mentioned  About the esters  In the flashing  But your facts  Doesn't make any sense  To say that  Yes the inoculations  Have worked  No one's getting polio  Or not many people  Getting polio  In this country  So what's the issue? 
[01:29:30]  Well I didn't bring up polio  You did  I am  But you mentioned inoculations  Correct  And I'm saying  It has a high level  Of mercury in it  Which mercury is the poison  So what is the  What do you think  The reason for that  Is because it has  A longer shelf life?  As far as I know  That's what  Conclusion I've come to  Yes  Okay so  The shot they give you  That has the mercury  In it  Are the long lasting  Effects of that mercury  More dangerous  Than the possibility  Of not getting the shot  And having no vaccination  Against polio 
[01:30:00]  Or not being vaccinated  Against it  Well it all depends  On what disease  I mean  Because when you're  With kids  If the kid down  The street  And you've got  Chickenpox  Most of the parents  Would bring the kids down  So all the kids  Do get chickenpox  Oh yeah  Remember how sick  Our parents used to be?  What the fuck?  Why are you bringing me  Into a chickenpox house?  Yeah they won't  Get it out of the way quick  Let's take our chances  I remember that  Holy crap  You just brought up  I never got memory  You didn't have  A parent that brought you  To some kid's house  Who had chickenpox  I never got the chickenpox  And you had to play  With them a little bit  And swaps spit 
[01:30:30]  To make sure you got it  Swaps spit  You had to blow each other  What?  What?  He cut out  The government got him  The government got you  Black ops  He fucking knew too much  He rappelled down  Kicked his window in  Nah without getting into it  Fucked him up  I talked to my pediatrician  Because I got a young son  At home  And she said  That Jenny McCarthy  Did a major disservice  To parents out there  Entertainment  With her bullshit about  She didn't really know  What she was talking about 
[01:31:00]  Half the time  When she went on  All these shows  Basically scaring the shit  Out of so many parents  To not give their kids shots  These pediatricians  Are up on the latest studies  And doing the best they can  To have as much knowledge  As possible  When they advise you  Whether or not  You should do this  For your kid  Why were they listening to her?  The parents are dummies  To listen to Jenny McCarthy  Like she's got a fucking  PhD in anything  And then I asked  Why the whooping cough  Is coming back in California  And they said  Probably because  A lot of parents  Have decided against  Giving their kids shots 
[01:31:30]  And this is  The other side of that  You're going to bring back  Some shit  That's good  I have to leave guys  I'll see you  What?  I have to go  On Marco Island  No  Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday  Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday  At 4 o'clock on Raw Dog  We taped yesterday  Colin was very funny  Me, Bobby, and Colin  Tonight, tomorrow  But Sunday  I'm sorry  Not Sunday, Saturday  Oh, okay  And then 4 o'clock  On Raw Dog today  The Jim Norton program  With Colin Quinn  He was great, yeah  We've got to rerun those  On our channel  That'd be great if they did that  It's kind of silly  That we're not  Yeah, I never thought of it  A cool presentation over here 
[01:32:00]  Why not?  Right?  That'd be very good  And we've got the  Amy Schumer argument  How do we do this  Without you?  You don't have to do it  I heard about it  I definitely want to hear it  What happened?  I'll save a couple minutes  You got a couple minutes  I think she argued  With this guy  Steven Crowder  Who's a younger guy  He's 22, 23  Fox loves him  He's on a lot  He's a conservative dude  He's a stand-up, I guess  I've never seen his act  But he's on a lot  And we love the Amy Schumer  Love Amy, yeah  But I heard that  Someone told me  There was an argument 
[01:32:30]  I just have not heard it  Alright, let's take a listen  So Amy and Steven  Start with different  Points of view  On what, I don't know  We'll find out  And Steven takes a shot  At her  Amy could hold her own  Of course she can  Here's my question  It's admirable  When do you stop?  When do you stop  With the abstinence?  How will you know it's time?  Well, once you have a ring  On your finger  Obviously  The only way to know  For sure is once you're married  And of course  People know I'm a Christian  This column is not at all  Pushing faith in anybody  It's just talking about  The actual benefits  If you really want to  Argue for abstinence  You can stop the argument  And be abstinent  Don't get sick and die  Yeah 
[01:33:00]  But, you know  I can say from personal experience  That it does build a bond of trust  Constantly you hear women  How often do you hear  Well, don't you trust me?  It's like, no  You slept with me on the first date  So of course I don't trust you  It's that old thing  Like I would join a club  That would let me into that club  Right  You know  She's going to sleep with me  Then she'll sleep with anybody  You're just going to be Canadian  They won't let me in  Except for Canadian club  Ginger  Amy, do you have any thoughts on this?  Yes  But also, you know  If I sleep with a guy  On the first date  Usually if a guy holds my hand  He's going to wind up  So, here's the thing  I don't think that  I don't think that  I don't think that 
[01:33:30]  Women should use sex  As a bargaining chip  And a lot of them do  If I want to sleep with someone  I do it  And I am a monogamous slut  Can I say that on air?  Yeah, I think you can  Monogamous slut  But what I'm saying is  Yeah, I have a higher risk of disease  I also have a much higher risk of fun  That's great  She's the shit  That's funny  Anything worse than a young Christian  I don't buy it  There's a problem there  Whenever you get that  There's just an issue 
[01:34:00]  That I don't know what it is  And especially since  She's just talking about her own life  She's not  At this point, at least  She's not telling anybody else  What they should do  Yeah, yeah  At risk of fun  No, no, I'm not saying that  What I'm saying is  To prove my point  By saying that, you know  You don't think it should be used  As a bargaining tool  Yeah  I mean, as far as  The kind of point of the column  Is that abstinence  Is the one taboo issue  Regarding sex  I mean, it's like  Oh, it'll be a dirty stand-up comic  You're cracking new ground there  Copernicus  But once you talk about abstinence  Fuck you  How about your cracking new ground  By saying cracking new ground  Copernicus  Yeah, that's a Dennis Miller thing 
[01:34:30]  How old is that?  Yeah  For him  But I mean, yeah  I think they were making that joke  With Copernicus  And as far as being a dirty comic  In comparison with clean comedy  And what's acceptable on network  It is breaking new ground  Because clean comedy  Do clean comedy  You're breaking new ground there  That's been acceptable  Since time out of mind  That's been forever  That's been on TV  Dirty comedy  He's not been on TV  For that long  Yeah  But I've never seen his stand-up  He might be a good act  But anybody who judges  Clean or dirty 
[01:35:00]  And thinks that one  Has more valor than the other  I think is idiotic  And I don't think  Can be a good comic  Look at George Carlin  I'm still going through  His HBO specials  He's got a lot of dirty shit  That is beyond hilarious  And clever  Robert Klein was a genius  And he's primarily clean  Right  Carlin was a genius  And he could be filthy  Right  Neither one means anything to me  As far as who's better  I know clean comics  That are complete hacks  Yeah  You're cracking new ground  There Copernicus  But once you talk about abstinence  Everyone all of a sudden  They put you  Like right now 
[01:35:30]  We have to talk about it  Because who is this kid  Who's talking about abstinence  Who you know  Well it's who is this kid  Who's you know 23  You don't know  Who you're going to be sexually yet  So to talk about it  With such authority  And arrogance  I don't know who I'm going to be what  You don't know  Who you're going to be sexually yet  You're going to be into  Really weird things  In about a decade  Oh I have no doubt  Oh I have no doubt  I have no doubt  Amy's funny man  She really is good  And you know  You slip by the dirty comedian thing  But honestly  You call yourself a comedian  But you don't do it that much  Like I go fishing a couple  Oh thank you  Copernicus 
[01:36:00]  I can't say  Copernicus  Thank you  Is it Brian Regan line  Right right  I was saying Dennis Miller  But of course  It's a very famous Brian Regan line  But was  It was a very clean comic  Okay yeah  Was he talking about being a dirty comic  You're cracking new ground there  Oh maybe he was attacking her  Okay  Yeah he was so attacking her  Wow  And you know  You slip by the dirty comedian thing  But honestly  You call yourself a comedian  But you don't do it that much  Like I go fishing a couple times a year  But I don't introduce myself on TV  As a fisherman  Wow  That's great  This is not really personal 
[01:36:30]  For a concept about abstinence  I'm saying the whole point  Is that someone can get up on stage  We even talk about it in a column  And talk about anything dirty that they want  But the second you mention abstinence  People they pucker with discomfort  Like oh no we can't talk about this  And you're vilified as judgmental  It's just not  Statistically  It's the healthiest thing to do  It is conducive towards a better marriage  By a 25% spread  It only takes that one person though  And there is no  There's no contract  That the person's not going to cheat on you  Because they're abstinent  She could call in love with somebody else  Well actually there is a contract  That's what a marriage is  It's a contract  It's a contract that more than 60% of people break 
[01:37:00]  No actually that's not true  Actually if you look at the new U.S. Census Bureau statistics  More than 70% of first time marriages last  Okay  Oh shut the fuck up  That's just a bullshit stat  More than 70% of first time marriages last  They don't  No they don't  I don't think that's right  I don't believe that either  That is a lot of bullshit  I think it's close to 70% where they don't work out right  Last what the first year  Like there's a  There's some kind of a dot dot dot after what he said 
[01:37:30]  Okay but then the guy goes off and sleeps with a young boy  Well  Good you guys stayed married but then there's instability  Well I want you to bring out the statistics that guys are running around rampantly sleeping with young boys  First of all I'm not a boy  I know I have characteristics as such  As such  Oh god 70%  That's a problem  That is a problem  That is true  I've got a beard guy  But I have to say my last three relationships which each lasted between two to five years 
[01:38:00]  We slept with each other almost immediately  And it's because I knew that I wanted to be with them  You know  Except that  But why'd you kill them?  Except at the five year mark  Yeah but so what  At least I figured it out  And I didn't get married and spend my life with somebody that I hate  I have some fun  And I had a great deal  Statistically that's wrong  I mean if you want to disregard stats  Statistically what's wrong?  Statistically 87% of people who wait until they're married are happier  And 52% aren't  And the same thing that you can look at the  I cannot  Where are these stats coming from? 
[01:38:30]  When you're a young guy and you're living your life  Or you're quoting  It's like I don't want to hear that  Personally  Amy's at least talking about her life  Right  She's not being detached and talking from behind glass  About what she thinks the world is  Right  She's giving her experience  This is what my relationships were  Five year relationship is not bad  Well statistics don't mean a fucking thing  I mean shit  And all you have to  They can be manipulated  All you have to do is this  Remember the first girl you slept with?  Imagine you're still with that girl  Ew buzz 
[01:39:00]  Exactly  And in my case  It was a girl that  It's been said on the show  With that weird hair mane birth defect  She had from her neck all the way to her tailbone  That wouldn't have been good  Beautiful from the front  But what the fuck from the back  Fucking my little pony from the back  You don't want her  Oh well we gotta ask Dr. Steve about that  Maybe after the break  I wanna know what that's about  Follicles grow  And a lot of times  They go down the spine  Lick your litus  Develop  It wasn't a little peach fuzz though 
[01:39:30]  This was dark fucking  It was  It was  Defined  Brundle  Brundle fly hair  Yes  52% aren't  The same thing that you can look at  The social organization of sexuality  These are not Christian funded studies  How do you have statistics on people's happiness?  You tell them  Are you happy?  Are you emotionally satisfied?  Is there a church smiling?  No  You can say  Are you emotionally satisfied in your marriage?  Yes  No  By 25% spread  Both spouses who are virgins  Yes  Are you sexually satisfied in your marriage?  Yes  Is it difficult for you to be a orgasm?  Why would people have to be honest about their emotions? 
[01:40:00]  It's all the sources that are listed in the column  Every single source  These are things that have been used by the Kinsey Institute  What I'm saying is  Who cares what they said?  A lot of people say they have happy marriages  Even in therapy  When they're miserable  So the 25 point spread  Doesn't matter  Because only the people who would be lying  Would be the people who are abstinent?  I just don't know any happy  Happily married people  Speaking of statistics  I don't  Let's get back to my play  I love how she keeps it fun  Yeah, but she's talking about her life  It's like  Right  And finally  What are you doing?  And it ended with this  I'm sorry that that got so heated 
[01:40:30]  I just want to say  That was good TV  I just want to say that  I read the blog  And it was  It did come across to me  Like, you know  You ended it by saying  No judgments  But it definitely felt  Very judgmental  Of course  In the column  It was written about  The reaction from people like you  Who the second you talk about abstinence  Get upset  So, thank you  Well, people like me  Who are almost 10 years older than you  And know what it's like to live life  And not just have all these morals  With no life experience  Right  I have no life experience  That is true  I'm sorry  But somebody who works a little bit  Of the Christian comedy circuit  The Christian comedy circuit  What's just happening here? 
[01:41:00]  The irony is  I have to say  This is the longest debate  We've ever had on Red House  It is  And the irony is  They make a very sexy TV  Yeah  That's  Wow  She showed him though  Yeah  She really did  What are you doing?  Life experience  That guy's gonna fucking  That guy is gonna figure out  What the hell is going on  In his own life  Like she said  In 10 years  Being some freaky shit  And be like  Oh, I was an asshole 
[01:41:30]  Sometimes you feel like  You have  Like, I feel like  I'm watching somebody  Who thinks they have  An angle on something  And hey  I'll be this guy  Whether it's  Angry guy  Remember we used to tease  Angry Matt  Oh, he's getting angry again  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That's, you know  That guy wants to be  Moral guy  Yeah  I don't know him well enough  To know if it's true  I mean, my interactions  With him have just been  On red eyes  He sounds to me  Like an asshole  I didn't like him  When I first met him  But, you know  After talking to him  A little bit 
[01:42:00]  He was fine  Yeah, he was alright  I didn't like him  What does he have  That he can do for you?  Nothing  Believe me  Nothing  Why are you saying  That you like him?  Because he was okay  I can't lie and say  That he was a douche  After I got to  He was okay  I can't  Believe me  I just can't bullshit  Alright, Jimmy  You got your hoodie on  You got to get out of here  Yeah, go  Marco Island awaits  Tonight  Tomorrow  Make sure you see  Jimmy and Marco Island  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday  If you wish  And also  There was an episode  Of Bullshit  With Penn and Teller  Talking about  The shots your kids get 
[01:42:30]  Oh really?  And they determined  I think it's all bullshit  What they're trying to say  Nice flight, Jimmy  Break a leg  See you, Jimmy  Can we maybe  Not on your flight  Can we try to get him  On the phone  For maybe a phone call?  I hear he's in New York too, Penn  Really?  Yeah, he'll talk about that shit  He did all the real research  He certainly does  There's a lot of parents  Out there wondering  Yes  A lot of people think  Jenny McCarthy was full of shit  With her knowledge  You'll get people  That are just adamant though  When they talk about it  And there's no change  In their minds  That's with most arguments  Like that guy 
[01:43:00]  That was just on  Red Eye  That we were listening to  Yeah  You're not going to  Convince him of anything  He's going to come out  With his bullshit statistics  Do you think  That many people  That save themselves  For marriage  Are happier  About their sexual  Their sexuality  Or their sexual life  How could you be?  Like what do you have  To base it on?  Yeah, how could you be?  Yeah, I'm real happy  Oh yeah, based on what?  Like fucking  You don't have anything else 
[01:43:30]  To base it on  When you wonder  What else is out there  The entire time  So at least you  Get to play around  Out there a little bit  Then you get married  Then you go  Okay, I know what I did  You know what I mean?  Where I've been  And wouldn't you think  That if you're a virgin  Virgin  And you get married  You are really  Going to be thinking  Like wow  I wonder what  Someone else would be like  Right  It's basic human nature 
[01:44:00]  You would be getting  Banged by the same  Fucking shit  The same virgin guy  Is doing his  Fucking same virgin  Fucking on you  Don't you think  The girl would think  Like  I wonder what a  Big a dick  Would be like  Or I wonder what  A fucking  Different move  Or a guy that  Flips her over  And wants to  Tag her in the ass  In my case  It would have been  I wonder what  A non-smelly pussy  Would taste like  See  Exactly  My first real girlfriend  You don't want that 
[01:44:30]  It was horrendous  You don't want to  But I was  Young and naive  I just assumed  They all kind of  Smelt like that  And there's got to be  Some kind of  Twist in a statistic  Like that  If he did  Actually read a stat  Like that  Yeah  There's got to be  Some kind of thing  Where well  If you  If you stayed a virgin  Until you got married  You probably  Are in that mindset  That very  Like religious  Or  Fucked up in the head  You were so 
[01:45:00]  Fucking sexually repressed  Or maybe you just  Don't have a sex drive  Or no sex drive  Yeah yeah  Or very low sex drive  So are they happy with it  Yeah  Okay they could be happy with it  Because they're not  Thinking about sex  You know  Like the rest of us  And they're asking  Virgin  That like  The stats are taken  From just virgins  It's like  Alright we asked  Virgin married couples  This question  Are you happy with it  Oh yeah  Well they're all  Kind of  They're all a little kooky  Two virgins getting married  Sorry  You're a little  Fucking kooky  In this day and age 
[01:45:30]  And I think  That's where  That stat gets  A little skewed  Mm-hmm  Are  Like two virgins  Getting married  Yeah  You think that's  Still going on  Yeah  Like in weirdo world  Really  In places where  Fucking  Like  Like with this guy  This abstinence guy  That was talking  Yeah  It's just a weird  It's a weird thing to do  It's not  Like a normal thing  Like well  We're doing the normal thing  The people that  Have premarital sex 
[01:46:00]  That's crazy  That's  No  The two virgins  Getting married  Is a weirdo thing to do  Do you think at least  The virgin girls  Have taken some dick  In  I'm not talking about  That technical virgin shit  Where they're  Taking it where the poo  Comes out  Where they're taking it  Where the doodoo comes out  They're taking their  Smelly hole  I'm thinking  How do you  Look someone in the eye  And go  I'm a virgin  I'm a virgin  Just want to let you know  I'm a virgin  Yeah  But she knows 
[01:46:30]  What  Oh god  What she's taking  Where the poo comes out  Oh my hymen's intact  But my fucking roids  Are hanging like  Melted mozzarella  Right  Just don't make me  Laugh too hard  Or we might have  A situation  Yeah  But I'm a virgin  Don't make any jokes  On the altar  Because you know  I'm wearing a white dress  I'm a virgin  No I'm technically  A virgin  I'm still a virgin  But you know  Yeah  I had some fun  Where the poo comes out  Yeah  I had a little fun  In college 
[01:47:00]  But nothing to worry about  I'm a virgin  I'm a virgin  It was just my smelly spot  My smelly brown spot  Around back  Someone put his wee-wee  In there  Hey god damn it  The couple's first dance  She's losing her  Her bowels  On the dance floor  Just pink socking  But she's a virgin  But she's a virgin  That first time in bed 
[01:47:30]  Is going to be special  That's right  When those two are virgins  And they have sex  For the first time  He's breaking her hymen  That's a special time  She should be crying  Right  Pay no attention  To what happens to her  She just instinctively  Flips over onto her belly  Right  It's like  Oh I forgot  We're married now  Okay  That was to protect my virginity  I don't have to do that anymore  So how is this done  I'm not sure how this is done  Without it going in my poopy hole  Right  I'm going to now save that 
[01:48:00]  For when you turn 30  Yeah and then she won't give that up  Anymore  Because she's a married woman  She's got some class now  You know better  Only for your birthday  Oh god  Yeah  Nothing better than a fun little poke around  To see if everything's okay  Jesus  You've got to kind of knock around  Yeah  Is it alright over here  Let me  Yeah  I'm just kind of fidgeting about 
[01:48:30]  You know what  Let's open the phones  Tom in Iowa  Tom  Hey guys  It's always too bad  When you flip them over  And you've got to ask about  That small scar  From the ravaging they got  When they were a teenager  Oh where they needed a stitch or two  Do girls get  I don't know  I think it's something that rips  Oh Jesus  But who's ripping  I mean come on  Number one  Good points all around  But 87%  You think about 
[01:49:00]  Number one  Do you know anybody  That was a virgin  When they were married  And it's all about opportunity  It's just like cheating  Happy marriages  Are those people  That don't have the opportunity  For anything better  The people that are virgins  Are people that didn't have opportunities  To do anything to begin with  Yeah you've got to throw that  Into the stats too  Yeah you're right  People that didn't want to be virgins  Yeah  But it just turned out that way  And then they had some morality  And they did get married  So they're like  Okay I'm not going to  Be cheating on this woman  But I really did want to  Get some pussy  Before I got married  Would have been nice  Right but I didn't have 
[01:49:30]  The opportunities  Yeah  That's got to be part  Of the stat too  No game  Think about that guy  That you had as a friend  That you're always like  This guy is going to marry  The first woman  That will let him have  And that's the guy  That's happy for  He's happy as long  As he's getting some  Right on brother  Let me go to the Bronx  Mike in the Bronx  Yeah  My wife actually saved it  And she's a train wreck  Emotionally now  With anything  Especially when she  Shit with her family 
[01:50:00]  It's just a mess  And what you were saying  She became kind of a freak  Afterwards  Right  We're putting together  Our own virgin list  Of people we know  I turn that down  Yeah thank you Mike  You can't listen to the radio  When you call our show  It's really distracting  I would have loved  To talk to you more there  But Danny just put together  A quick list of the virgins  We know  Yeah let's take a look  At the virgins  We know  These people associate  With the Opie and Anthony show  And it proves a lot  Yeah  About that dumb stat  Go ahead Anthony  Well we have Patty 
[01:50:30]  Stalker Patty  Virgin  That's great  She's a virgin  She's fucking 60 years old  Whatever she is  Blind Stevie  Our new intern  Our new intern  Virgin  Virgin  Virgin  David the intern  If you remember  The Jewy Jew  The Jewy Jewy  David the intern  Virgin  And of course  Bobo  Virgin  Bobo's a virgin  Are these stable people  And even though  He talks a good game  I'm thinking Ira 
[01:51:00]  Might be a virgin too  No Iris  You don't think  Ira's a virgin  I've had a good time  Iris tapped so many hookers  It's not even funny  You think he put up numbers  Oh he put up some numbers  Three days in a row  So many that I don't think  I understand where he gets the money  To pay for them  Yeah  You think he's got numbers  Yeah he seems very confident  In his hooker getting abilities  Oh yeah yeah  Seriously you think  Oh definitely  No doubt  Whatever government assistance  He's getting 
[01:51:30]  Is going straight into  Some hooker's pocket  Yeah  His fucking apartment  Is bed bug infested  But man  He's sexually satisfied  As long as I'm getting  The pussy  Right  Just using all his money  On whores  Getting laid  By a whore  Why do we have to wait  For Friday  For him to be on our show  I know  Don't we have his phone number  Or something  He's the best  And why does Jay Thomas  Only use him on Fridays  I don't know  He's crazy  Can we have him for Tuesdays  Can we share him with Jay Thomas  Great  Oh yeah see 
[01:52:00]  And then you got this  That happens  Chris in Alabama  Chris  Or Alaska  Alabama  Alright let's go  When I was younger  Oh Fez is a virgin too  Oh jeez  So put him on the list  As well  Go ahead Chris  When I was younger  My ex wanted to wait  Until she got married  To have sex  I was all for it  After we got married  About five years down the road  She just started  Sleeping around  That's all she wanted to do 
[01:52:30]  Was start  Having sex with other guys  See  That ain't good  I went through a bad divorce  Because we waited  Until we were married  To have sex  See that's bullshitting  Why would you do that  Well at the time  It sounded like a great idea  But now that I look back at it  How does it ever sound like  A great idea  To not  Check out  What the whole thing  Is about first  That's  The old  Test drive the car  Fucking thing  Because it's a sin 
[01:53:00]  You know  Oh is that it  Yeah God says  It's a sin  When I was  Growing up  I mean it's not like  It was that long ago  But waiting until marriage  Wasn't even an option  It was more about  Like trying to beat my friends  Yeah  To it  You know  Or  If my friend  You know  Lost it at 16  I was trying to do my best  To  You know  To get laid  Before  Yeah  Before I turned 16  Right  That's exactly what you did  It was never the other way  Like oh I bet I can wait longer  Than he can  It was never  Fuck that  You didn't want  You didn't want to wait 
[01:53:30]  Why would God make pussy  Look so good  Yeah  But you're not allowed  To fucking partake  Until you get married  Look but don't touch  Exactly  Yeah  Why  It's temptation  And free will  Wouldn't that make God  A sick fuck  Well yeah  God is  Because  Oh God  What  I'm bunching out  Oh you're scared  No  You don't want the lightning bolt  To hit you too  Yeah  I don't care  You know  No one's asking obviously 
[01:54:00]  But I believe in some kind of God thing  I'm just not a fan of the organized religion part  I mean it's crazy to me to think that  That God makes all  All that pussy  Yep  And you're not allowed to touch it  That's insane  Everything  At least in the Catholic religion  Is good stuff  Anything that's good  You're really not allowed to have  But it's there as a temptation  And a test  Right  You're taking a test  And  And 
[01:54:30]  It's to prove  Your worthiness  You have free will  But you're not supposed to  Do these things  Right  And God puts these little obstacles  In your way  To see if he can trip you up  But who  It's a big game for the afterlife  How do you know  That's what God was  Going for  Because someone told us  It's written down a book somewhere  I don't know  And who told that guy  The Bible  And who told that guy  The prophets  Who told that guy  Well they just know  They feel like 
[01:55:00]  Have a direct line to God  It's like a phone tag thing  Is that really what God meant  Yeah  No  Whatever  There is  Whatever  There  If there is a  Supreme being  I don't think all these rules  Came with it  I think people made up  All the fucking rules  To tell you the truth  That's what I'm saying  Organized religion  And like  You know  Everyone needs an answer  To the question  Because they feel  A little freaked out  To just think  We're some random thing 
[01:55:30]  That popped up  As a life form  On a rock  Hurdling through the cosmos  But  Maybe  Indeed  That is what we are  But people don't like that  It's not comforting  We need to think  That there's something afterwards  So  You get this  Supreme being  That made everything  But then you gotta build  A story around him  You can't just have  Oh it's a being  What is he  I don't even  Fucking  So then people  Stop making shit up  Like well  He does this  And he doesn't like  When you do this 
[01:56:00]  And that  And that was like  All people  Just writing that shit down  Are you saying  God is a fad  God is a fad  Just like  The blues channel  And wifi  And wifi  And color TV  I don't know  Yeah  Then who made God  Yeah  I remember the first time  I got scared  And these were the questions  I was asking myself  In my little room  By myself  You don't do that  In the darkness  I was eight  No  And then I was trying  To wrap my arms 
[01:56:30]  Around the universe  And I was like  Okay well  The universe  Alright wow  As big as your imagination  Sure it is  But then the imagination  Eventually has to stop  So you're like  Okay now  This is what I would think  As an eight year old  It scared the shit out of me  So I'm like  Okay the universe  Is really big  But it's gotta end somewhere  So okay it ends  And then I'm thinking  In my dumb little  Eight year old head  Alright it ends  So it's a wall  There's the end of the universe  Right there  Right behind you  And see  But then what creeped me out  Is like  But then what's behind the wall  Just 
[01:57:00]  You know what it is  It's so much distance  That your mind  Can't even comprehend it  Right  Of wall  But then what's behind  That really thick wall  More wall  Right  It never ends  Now that I'm older  I can deal with it  A little better  But when you're eight  And you're trying to  Rationalize all this shit  By yourself in your room  Your eight year old head  Is just freaking you  The fuck out  All you wanted  Was the sun to come out  And you wanted to  Put your little sneakers on  And run outside and play  I just wanna play 
[01:57:30]  Right  Let's go find some  Yellow jackets  This is too much  And then one day  I woke up  And had a fucking thought  A profound thought  Of life  And it just went  There was also a time  When my parents  Did you ever have this one  When your parents left  For the first time  Well  Your parents would leave  Would leave  And you didn't really care  But that one day  They left  And it scared the shit out of you  That they were not in the house  No  And I had a good cry  Over that as well  Really?  Yeah  Baby  I know 
[01:58:00]  I should talk  Nah  We had like me  And my brother  And my sister  Hanging out  All at the same time  So when  They left  And it was good  When they left  The yelling stopped  So we were kinda like  Oh good  It was party time  We're out of the fucking house  Alright  Yeah you wanna play  That George Carlin bit  Going into break?  Why not?  We talked about  George Carlin earlier  Joe DeRose is in  He talks about  Religion in his act  I do believe  So we'll say hi to Joe next  We got Danny McBride  From Eastbound and Down 
[01:58:30]  Calling our show  I don't know  Around 10 o'clock I think  It'll be late in the show today  But Eastbound and Down  Is coming back to HBO  I saw the first episode  It was great  Very very happy  That show is back  You'll have to check that out  I haven't seen it  I'm a bad interview guy  That hasn't seen it  Kevin from Connecticut  Likes my God theory  But it's really Anthony's theory  I like your God elimination theory  If something bad happens  To a religious group  That God gets crossed  Off the list  Yeah cross it off the list 
[01:59:00]  And then we can figure out  Which God is the real one  We're all supposed to follow  Where there's like somebody  That's following a God  That only good shit  Is happening to  And they're impervious  That was the other thing  Growing up  I grew up  Pretty hardcore Catholic  I went through  The whole fucking thing man  Sunday school  Catechism  Bible school  Tuesday nights  At some weirdo's house  Where you knew  The couple was all fucked up  Teaching religion  To little kids  Oh that's not good  I went on religious retreats  Oh my God 
[01:59:30]  You so got molested  I've thought long and hard  About that  Maybe I just blocked it out  I've thought that too  Religious retreats  When all that God crap  Wasn't being talked about  We had a really good time  Because we were teenagers  Nothing good about  A religious retreat  We made it pretty good  We did  Absolutely  I know  A religious retreat  So what is it  Yeah it was like  I don't even remember  It was somewhere in  Would you read the Bible  It was like  What's the town near King's Park 
[02:00:00]  Or after King's Park  Or just before King's Park  Smithtown  What the fuck was it called  There was some like hill there  And there was some kind of  Retreat house or something  That's where the insane asylum is  No not there  Oh maybe they just told me  I was on a religious retreat  Insane asylum  But then like  Not having an open mind  About other religions  Used to drive me nuts  Growing up too  Yeah  Like oh we're not  Going to acknowledge  That like a lot of people  Out there  Billions of people 
[02:00:30]  Like believe in other shit  Yeah  No this is the only way  Really  This is the one  Everyone else is fucked  Everyone else is fucked  Because they're not  Following this one  When rapture happens there  You'll be you know  Taken up to the paradise  And they all just  Kind of burn in hell  What's rapture  Yeah  I didn't learn that  In Bible school  That's when you know  Everything  Well the shit goes down  Really  That's when Jesus comes back  And decides you know  Hey everyone  So it's a lot of pressure  Being a human being  Fort Salonga 
[02:01:00]  Yes  Alright thank you  To you  Thank you  Fort Salonga  Now help me out  I went on a religious retreat  In some fucking hill there  Wow  This is a memory  I haven't thought of in years  Gotta hope  Was that down by like that river  That little creaky river thing  I don't know  I remember  I fucked there once  Yeah  Yeah  Outdoor  The outdoor babbling  Brook fuck  I made out  During the religious retreat  Yeah  I thought it was cool  Wow  I was a late bloomer  What was the priest's name  I was a late fucking bloomer 
[02:01:30]  I thought grabbing a little booby  Through the sweater  Was like fucking  Ah that was sex  That was big time for me  That was sex  Yeah so  A lot of pressure  As a human being  You gotta figure out  Which religion is the right one  Or you're fucked for eternity  Yeah  Well  And I gotta take the word of my guy  Because that's how I was born  There was something odd though  About Catholicism  That if you were  If you  Believed in another god  Or another religion 
[02:02:00]  You could still get in  Because Catholicism would accept you  I think as long as you know  You have that little deathbed thing  Where you go like  Ah  Cleanse me of my sins  I accept you  Blah de blah de blah  And then you  That's all bullshit too  What if the priest  Is stuck in traffic  And you meant to talk to the priest  On your deathbed  No you gotta just talk to God  You don't need  You don't need the priest anymore  Nah you don't need that  I heard you needed the priest for a while  As long as it's on the deathbed  You say you know  Something  Shit like you know  Ah cleanse me of my sins  Accept me  I accept you 
[02:02:30]  What if God is too busy  You drop dead  You're fine  But as you're doing that  What if God was too busy  Fucking up New Orleans  No he's everywhere  I don't know  New Orleans took a lot of attention  But God's everywhere  I think a lot of people on their deathbeds  Didn't hear God that day  There were like probably 50 gods  To handle that  But then like  There's other gods  All over the place  So you know more than I do  And I grew up with this shit  I just make it up  I have no idea  Alright  Joe DeRozan next  More of your phone calls  They're lit  Fucking lit 
[02:03:00]  Nice  And we'll go to break  With a nice George Carlin God bit  Stay there  But I want you to know  I want you to know something  This is sincere  I want you to know  When it comes to believing in God  I really tried  I really  Really tried  I tried to believe  That there is a God  Who created each of us  In his own image and likeness  Loves us very much  And keeps a close eye on things  I really tried to believe that  But I gotta tell you  The longer you live  The more you look around  The more you realize 
[02:03:30]  Something is fucked up  Something is wrong here  War, disease, death, destruction  Hunger, filth, poverty, torture  Crime, corruption  And the ice capades  Something is definitely wrong  This is not good work  If this is the best God can do  I am not impressed  Results like these  Do not belong on the resume  Of a supreme being  This is the kind of shit  You'd expect from an office temp  With a bad attitude  And just between you and me 
[02:04:00]  In any decently run universe  This guy would have been out  On his all-powerful ass  A long time ago  And by the way  I say this guy  Because I firmly believe  Looking at these results  That if there is a God  It has to be a man  No woman could or would ever  Fuck things up like this  So  So  So  If  If  If there is a God  If there is  I think most reasonable people 
[02:04:30]  Might agree  That he's at least incompetent  And maybe  Just maybe  Doesn't give a shit  Doesn't give a shit  Which I admire in a person  And which would explain  A lot of these bad results  So rather than be  Just another one  Of these mindless  Religious robots  Blindly believing  That all of this  Is in the hands  Of some spooky  Incompetent father figure  Who doesn't give a shit  I decided to look around  For something else to worship  Something I could really count on  And immediately  I thought of the sun 
[02:05:00]  Happened like that  Overnight  I became a sun worshiper  Well not overnight  You can't see the sun at night  But first thing the next morning  I became a sun worshiper  Several reasons  First of all  I can see the sun  Okay  Yeah  Unlike some other gods  I could mention  I can actually see the sun  I'm big on that  If I can see something  I don't know  Kind of helps the credibility 
[02:05:30]  Along you know  So every day  I can see the sun  As it gives me  Everything I need  Heat  Light  Food  Flowers in the park  Reflections on the lake  And occasional skin cancer  But hey  At least there are no crucifixions  And we're not setting people  On fire  Simply because  They don't agree with us  Sun worship  Is fairly simple  There's no mystery  No miracles  No pageantry  No one asks for money  There are no songs to learn  And we don't have  A special building  Where we all gather  Once a week 
[02:06:00]  To compare clothing  And the best thing  The best thing  About the sun  It never tells me  I'm unworthy  Doesn't tell me  I'm a bad person  Who needs to be saved  Hadn't said  An unkind word  Treats me fine  So  I worship  The sun  But  I don't pray  To the sun  Know why  I wouldn't presume  On our friendship  It's not polite  I've often thought  People treat God  Rather rudely  Don't you  Trillions and trillions  Of prayers  Every day 
[02:06:30]  Asking and pleading  And begging  For favors  Do this  Give me that  I need a new car  I want a better job  And most of this  Praying takes place  On Sunday  His day off  It's not nice  And it's no way  To treat a friend  But people do pray  And they pray  For a lot of  Different things  You know  Your sister needs  An operation  On her crotch  Your brother was arrested  For defecating  In a mall  But most of all  You'd really like  To fuck that  Hot little redhead  Down at the  Convenience store  You know 
[02:07:00]  The one with the  Eye patch  And the club foot  Can you pray  For that  I think you'd have to  And I say  Fine  Pray for anything  You want  Pray for anything  But  What about  The divine plan  Remember that  The divine plan  Long time ago  God made  A divine plan  Gave it a lot  Of thought  Decided it was  A good plan  Put it into practice  And for billions  And billions of years  The divine plan  Has been doing  Just fine  Now you come along  And pray for something 
[02:07:30]  Well suppose  The thing you want  Isn't in  God's divine plan  What do you want  Him to do  Change his plan  Just for you  Doesn't it seem  A little arrogant  It's a divine plan  What's the use  Of being God  If every run down  Schmuck with a  Two dollar prayer book  Can come along  And fuck up your plan  And here's something else  Another problem  You might have  Suppose your prayers  Aren't answered  What do you say  Well it's God's will  Thy will be done  Fine  But if it's God's will  And he's going to do  What he wants to anyway  Why the fuck bother 
[02:08:00]  Praying in the first place  Seems like a big waste  Of time to me  Couldn't you just  Skip the praying part  And go right to his will  It's all very confusing  So to get around  A lot of this  I decided  To worship the sun  But as I said  I don't pray to the sun  You know who I pray to  Joe Pesci  Joe Pesci  Joe Pesci  Two reasons  First of all  I think he's a good actor  Okay  To me that counts  Second  He looks like a guy 
[02:08:30]  Who can get things done  Joe Pesci  Doesn't fuck around  Doesn't fuck around  In fact  In fact  Joe Pesci came through  On a couple of things  That God was having trouble with  For years  I asked God  To do something about  My noisy neighbor  With the barking dog  Joe Pesci  Straighten that cocksucker out  With one visit  It's amazing  What you can accomplish  With a simple baseball bat  So I've been praying to Joe 
[02:09:00]  For about a year now  And I noticed something  I noticed that all the prayers  I used to offer to God  And all the prayers  I now offer to Joe Pesci  Are being answered  At about the same  50% rate  Half the time  I get what I want  Half the time  I don't  Same as God  50-50  Same as the four leaf clover  The horseshoe  The rabbit's foot  In the wishing well  Same as the mojo man  Same as the voodoo lady  Who tells you your fortune  By squeezing the goat's testicles  It's all the same 
[02:09:30]  50-50  So just pick your superstition  Sit back  Make a wish  And enjoy yourself  And for those of you  Who look to the Bible  For its literary qualities  And moral lessons  I've got a couple of other stories  I might like to recommend for you  You might enjoy  The Three Little Pigs  That's a good one  Has a nice happy ending  Then there's  Little Red Riding Hood  Although it does have  That one X-rated part  Where the big bad wolf  Actually eats the grandmother  Which I didn't care for  By the way  And finally  I've always drawn  A great deal of moral comfort 
[02:10:00]  From Humpty Dumpty  The part I like the best  All the king's horses  And all the king's men  Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty  Back together again  That's because  There is no Humpty Dumpty  And there is no God  None  Not one  Never was  No God  In fact  I'm going to put it this way  If there is a God  If there is a God  May he strike this audience dead  See nothing happened  Nothing happened  Everybody's okay 
[02:10:30]  Alright  Tell you what  Tell you what  I'll raise the stakes  I'll raise the stakes a little bit  If there is a God  May he strike me dead  See  Nothing happened  Wait  Got a little cramp in my leg  And my balls hurt  Plus  I'm blind  I'm blind  Oh  Now I'm okay again  Must have been Joe Pesci  Huh  God bless Joe Pesci  Thank you all very much  Joe bless you  Thank you very much  I appreciate it 
[02:11:00]  The Opinion Anthony Show  On the Virus  Any MGMT fans in the room? 
[02:11:30]  Yes sir  Really?  Yeah  Saw them  When?  Radio City Music Hall  How was it?  Much better than I thought it would be  First time I saw them  They get a really bad reputation  That they suck live  And I thought they were really good  Yeah?  Yeah  I've seen much better live bands  But  I thought they were really going to suck live  They certainly did not  I didn't like their last album though  I like that book  It's weird right?  Yeah 
[02:12:00]  It grows on you though  Does it?  It really does  I like weird  I got no problem with weird  But it just didn't  It's kinda  It's kinda  It's kinda  It's British poppy  Yeah  Yeah  We should play a song for somebody  That album  I don't even know if it was their first  It was their first official release or something  Yeah the one where they're standing on the beach  With kids  And  A couple of fucking figs  Time to pretend  They're a very wimpy looking band 
[02:12:30]  Yeah  Very wimpy  Like if you ever  Like  Very wimpy guys  You saw it live  But like I've watched clips of them playing that song  That was just kids  Whatever the song's called  Love kids  A lot of different versions of kids on YouTube  If you really  I love kids  Anthony should have said that  Not me  What the hell is that?  Love kids  Can't get enough of kids  Yeah  What were you saying?  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah this is what we do  You're hysterical  We were  I didn't know we were on the fucking air 
[02:13:00]  Of course we are  You know what  We have to get a montage  Of how many times people  People go like  I know  Are we even on the air?  You know how deflating that is?  Are you on the air?  Like you decided this was important enough  To talk about  Not just to me  No I heard the music play  I don't blame you though  I thought we were on break  Sorry man  I didn't mean that insulting  No I like Muse  Someone's saying if you like MGMT  You like Muse  I love Muse  But what were you saying about MGMT?  Oh it's  I think that's 
[02:13:30]  I really love that song a lot  But the  But when you watch  I saw clips of him playing it live on YouTube  And it's just like  The guy singing it over a track  Like karaoke  Oh really?  And he does this really  He's dancing like this  Like it's really like  Yeah  Like a really stupid dance  Yeah and he's wearing some sort of fucking  They wear weird shit on stage  Right?  They  They're kind of artsy  I don't know  Yeah  They're kind of wimpy to be honest with you  I love Time to Pretend 
[02:14:00]  It's my favorite song they do  But  Yeah  And off the new album  It's  It's growing on me  But I don't know  I saw Pavement in Central Park last night  Yeah?  Oh I saw you tweeting about that  Whew  Great show man  I don't know much about Pavement  They're great  They're like  To me  They're like  The prototype band  For like every  You know  90's indie rock band  And forward  They're awesome  They're really great  It's like Sonic Youth  If you took out all the  Noise part  You know  Like just like the best parts 
[02:14:30]  Of Sonic Youth  Give me a Pavement song  I don't even know  If I know a song by them  I've heard their name forever  I know  I know Kurt Cobain  Liked Pavement right?  Yeah  And you can see  There's definitely like  Some similarities there  But Pavement's definitely not like  As aggressive as  Nowhere near as aggressive  And they just didn't want  Commercial success  Man  Man  I love that  I think every band  Wants commercial success  Go fuck yourself  With that bullshit  Once you get the success 
[02:15:00]  Like that man  It's just over  You lost your credibility  Not only to your fans  But to yourself  And oh god  My favorite  Live in your car  Well speaking of  Live in your car  That's my favorite  My favorite was like  When dumb Jewel  Was bopping around  Yodeling everywhere  Yeah yeah  As soon as it didn't  Stop selling  She came out with  That short skirt on  And her tits  Fucking flying out of the top  And she fixed her teeth too  Yeah  She fixed her choppers  Yeah she was on 
[02:15:30]  America's Got Talent recently  And she doesn't look like  The Jewel we remember  All banged up  Was she auditioning  On America's Got Talent  She might as well have been  Like why are they  Dragging her out  She fixed her  Buscemi teeth  Yeah she did  Yeah she kind of  Had that going  Yes she did  That whole  Whoa  Because that hippie thing  Wasn't working anymore  She said fuck that  Get my teeth fixed  And give me a short skirt  And something that  Shows off my tits  Go for her  Give me a pavement song  I want to be turned on  A pavement now  Don't go deep on me 
[02:16:00]  Give me a fucking song  I was going to tell you  I was going to tell you  Their most popular song  Jesus Christ  Sorry I jumped on you  Sorry I'm sorry  Cut Your Hair  Was their most popular song  But I don't even think  That that's going to  Alright  I think that was like  The sort of  You know  Relatively popular single  You ever see Sonic Youth  I've never seen them live  But I have a lot of  Their albums  I saw Sonic Youth  Open up for the Black Crows  A small little show  In Manhattan  For the Black Crows  I know  A long fucking time ago  Long fucking time ago 
[02:16:30]  Like whose fans  Were mad at which band  Unless maybe it wasn't  Sonic Youth  Look maybe  Holy shit  It had to be Sonic Youth  Sorry it was the  Jay Giles band  I got it mixed up  They kind of look like  They kind of look like  Nirvana on stage right  Sonic Youth  Yeah  Kim Gordon  Yeah  Like hot chick  But like heroin hot  Who  The chick in the band  Kim Gordon  The chick in the band  Was there a girl in the band  Oh boy  Let me see that  Does she sing 
[02:17:00]  Yeah  She sings and plays bass  Is she the main singer  Well her and Thurston Moore  Are the two  I remember seeing Thurston  Maybe she wasn't in the band  Or maybe she was sick  Or on her period that day  I was starting to think  She's on the ring  I was starting to think  I might not have seen  Sonic Youth  Someone's gotta help me out  Someone that knows music  Way more than me  Did Sonic Youth ever  Warm up for the Black Crows  In a small fucking show  Down there in the village  Or something  I can guarantee you this  If they did  They don't like you  Referring to it as  Warm up 
[02:17:30]  For the Black Crows  It was a lot of noise  Sonic Youth  They were very noisy  Not really going anywhere  For a while  That band  You're sad  People are saying no  Oh man really  That's a weird match  This is BAB day  So it's like 90  Anywhere it's from 92 to 95  Help me out  Who fucking warmed up  For the Crows  Maybe they did a guest spot  Eh 
[02:18:00]  No  Dude that's just such a weird  I mean you're talking about  It wasn't the Thompson Twins asshole  You're talking about a pot and mushroom crowd  Versus  I understand  A heroin and god knows what else crowd  It's like  It doesn't make sense  Don't put them in the same room  It's going to be trouble  A lot of people saying no  But then who the fuck was the band  With the Black Crows  Back in 91  Yeah these guys know music  Help me out  No  I think it was  It was an album release 
[02:18:30]  It was a special show  It was like one of those  Like secret shows  Even though everyone knew about it  Place held maybe  It was a little balcony  Maybe 500 people  Was it P. Diddy?  P. Diddy  Fucking  Was it Diddy?  P. Diddy  Alright let me hear this song by Pavement  Alright here we go  A little Pavement for ya  Oh I know that song  Huh?  I know this  Yeah yeah  I remember this song  We used to play this at AF 
[02:19:00]  We did?  Yeah I'm pretty sure  That's one I don't remember  I know the song but  It's a nice song too  This guy looks great too  He's like 45  He looks like he's  Fucking 32  Yeah you like that?  I like it  You like that he looks great? 
[02:19:30]  I like it  He's got a nice little tone  Yeah  Similar to yours  Alright  As I look at you  Across the console  Ah maybe it was the Pixies  Did the Pixies warm up  For the Black Crows?  No  I doubt it man  Because the Pixies were  In 91 the Pixies were like peaking  They were probably way bigger  Than the Black Crows were  At the time at least  Nah it was Sonic Youth  The Pixies doesn't match  That doesn't match either though  That doesn't  Black Crows would be like  You know 
[02:20:00]  They'd have like fucking  I mean not Dan Fogelberg  But somebody like that  You know what I mean?  Dan Fogelberg  Is that how you say it?  Maybe it wasn't the Black Crows  Maybe it wasn't the Black Crows  Maybe it wasn't at a show  It wasn't Soul Asylum  That makes sense though  Soul Asylum makes sense  Makes more sense  Yeah  So Opie may have seen  Sonic Youth maybe  Or someone else  Or not  Yeah  And possibly the Black Crows  A lot of people say no  But they're not coming up  With who played that night 
[02:20:30]  Someone else had to be  At that fucking show  Do you like the Crows man?  They were good bands  All the Crows to this day  Yeah I like those guys  They had some kind of  Like best of thing  That just came out  I just downloaded for free  Oh those are good  Black Crows  Still that  You probably saw  The Spin Doctors with them  No  See that's a bill  No that makes sense  Seriously  That would be a bill  That makes sense  I think the Spin  Blues Traveler  Shut the fuck up  No I'm serious  You saw a  Okay  Now I'm saying that  That's like who would have been  Black Crows  Right  Because I  I confused a big fat guy 
[02:21:00]  For a guy that's on her  Yeah  You fucking idiot  You saw Big Head Todd  And the Monster  Yeah that's it  Calloway is saying  You saw that  I didn't say 91 Kevin  In Atlanta you dick  What year was it?  I said between 92 and 95  95  95  95  Somewhere around there  So when you saw  Toad the Wet Sprocket  And by the way  I think the Black Crows  We're around in 91 because when I was working for the home of Rock and Roll in Rochester, New York  We played 
[02:21:30]  We played  The Big Signal  Single  Hard to Handle  Hard to Handle  Thank you  Hey wait a minute  So that was about 90  But B&B was the home of Rock and Roll  I worked for three homes of Rock and Roll  One in Buffalo  One in Rochester  One on Long Island  Rock and Roll's got like summer houses  What?  What kinds of places  Yeah they got a lot  It was a bomb of a joke  They were around  They came out  I was in  It wasn't Matchbox 20 dick  Yeah  What the fuck are these guys  They're killing me 
[02:22:00]  I'm getting killed  They came out and  I was in 6th or 7th grade when those guys came out  So that was 89-90  Yeah  When the Black Crows came out  Right?  89-90  That's what I'm thinking  Yeah  They were good  I left Rochester around 89-90  So  To go to Buffalo  What's your favorite Black Crow zone?  The second one  With Hotel Illness  And Remedy and all that stuff  All that shit  Yeah  I'm just not into that band  I like  You gotta get  Southern  What is it called?  Southern Harmony  And bluesy 
[02:22:30]  Something  Yeah  Ant doesn't like the blues stuff  I hate anything too bluesy  It's just like  Fucking right  We get it  Fucking dude  Do you hate anything that  Raw Dog Kate Hudson?  No actually  Yeah  That would be nice  Because they're responsible for both  Really?  Yeah  How about  Well I don't know if he raw Dog  I'm assuming he did  After all those years  Can we turn Anthony on  To Black Moon Rising?  No what was the name  That went on  Give me that song  Less Fuck  That's not  It's been a while  That album's got Remedy on it  I know  That's not my favorite album 
[02:23:00]  Though by then  Alright but I'm gonna turn you on  To a song that I  Fucking  Black Moon Creeping  That's right  Okay yeah  Give me Black Moon Creeping  Tell me this isn't a great song  Alright  We don't have to play the whole thing  Better than Black Creep Mooning  I know  It wasn't the Breeders  Georgia Satellites  The Breeders  No  Georgia Satellites  I can't ask you  You don't remember that  All T-Storm has is the live version  Huh?  He's only had his live version 
[02:23:30]  I swear  That's the only one in there  Why wouldn't he?  Let me  I'll try to find it on  Yeah Black Moon Creeping  Give me a little Black Moon Creeping  Well yeah  It's the live version  One of those songs  That should have been all over the radio  And wasn't  This will be good  I want to do a radio show  Called all the songs  That should have been all over the radio  But weren't  That's going to be the name of the song  What would your top picks be?  I don't know  You just fucking threw that at me  I'd have to  I'd have to think about it  You brought it up  It was your idea  Oh no  Oh  Listen to this crap 
[02:24:00]  This wannabe Rolling Stones  Bullshit  Look at the monica  This sounds like a Woodstock recording  Original  It's 1969  Woodstock  These guys wanted to live in the 70s  That's obvious  With our brain  Hippie shit  This is why  Yeah  No  Daddy found it on YouTube  Sleep in high 
[02:24:30]  Sleep in high  Sleep in high  Sleep in high  Sleep in high  And let me get to know your language  If I believe  Oh  Oh  I see  I would hate to be around for the dawn  Let it kick in, Anthony  Come on  Sleep in high  Get ready for the kick  I liked it better when it was called Bad Company 
[02:25:00]  I hate it  I hate it 
[02:25:30]  Why  It's not doing anything for me  Huh?  It's not doing anything for me  It's so generically just  You're killing me  It really is  You're killing the Black Crow fans out there  It's just fucking  It's fucking  Half Rolling Stones  Half Stevie Ray Vaughan  Half fucking  Oh no  Okay  That's one and a half  I like it  I like that tune  Yeah  Black Moon Creeping  Do you like it?  I dig the rhythm of that song  I dig it 
[02:26:00]  Someone's saying  Sonic Youth is a pot band too  So that would have made sense  Black Crows and Sonic Youth  Well look  Don't get me wrong  I've listened to Sonic Youth  While extremely high on pot  But  The drug that drives them  Is not pot  The drug that drives them  Or drove them  Was heroin  Heroin  Hence the lack of commercial success  Exactly  At the time they couldn't get out of bed  Exactly  Hence all their album titles  Look at any Sonic Youth album title  You're like  That's heroin  What's Sonic Youth 
[02:26:30]  The big number?  I don't really  I don't really know Sonic Youth  That big number?  I know it when I hear it I guess  Some of those  But  They had a couple  Like moderately big  They had that song with Chuck D  From  What's that album called?  Dirty  Diamond City  That was one  Sonic Youth  Diamond Sea  I really don't know  What the fuck was that song called? 
[02:27:00]  Danny  With Chuck D  And Sonic Youth  Cool Thing  Cool Thing  That was the big one  Let me hear a little of that  That's a cool song  Travis  A little of that  Trav  Only the live version  Yeah what do you got?  I have an hourglass  Just sitting there  Waiting  Alright  Alright we got it  This is not going to be it  Here's our video  Cool Thing  On Postmodern MTV  What the hell is this? 
[02:27:30]  Oh goo  That was me in the show  Nirvana kind of borrows this sound  And  They're looked at as geniuses  When this shit was out there  Right?  Yeah no  They just made it  They're the 
[02:28:00]  They really are the prototype  For Nirvana  Of course they are  I am not  I'm not seeing this  Going well with the black crows  Definitely not  Now that I'm seeing the video  I'm listening  Especially when  When Chuck D  Would come out on stage  It would be the first time  There was a black guy  At a black crows concert  Yeah  At a white blues band  It wasn't the 
[02:28:30]  Screaming cheetah  Wheelies  Of course not  But Nirvana was looked at  And Kurt was looked at  As brilliant  He was just copying  The sound of the music  He was listening to  That was it  Not just Nirvana  This like sounds like  Fucking  Nirvana just made this  Well mainstream  90's bands  Huh?  This sounds like  12 other  90's bands  I love Nirvana  But Nirvana took  Nirvana took  The  Catchiest  And most infectious 
[02:29:00]  Parts of Sonic Youth  And the Pixies  Put it together  Because the Pixies  Are one of my favorite  Bands ever  But like the Pixies  Have so much  Why would you like  The Pixies?  Oh dude  They're sick  Are you kidding me?  Name a song  That's sick  Yeah  Almost every song  I'm serious  I love all their shit  The Pixies are great  You would probably  Like the Pixies  Do you not like them?  I probably would  You don't like them?  I mean I know the name  It hurts a little bit  To say it out loud  As a man  The Pixies?  Yeah  Yeah that name  Kind of steers you 
[02:29:30]  Away from that  Did you have a Pixies  T-shirt?  No  Because they have  For such a cool band  They have the worst  Fucking t-shirts  I've ever seen  MGMT had shitty shirts  I was almost ready  To buy a fucking  Shirt for once  I was so psyched  For the Faith No More  Reunion tour this summer  And I went to it  And  Oh come on  Faith No More  Come on  Why?  The one song  Oh that's the worst song  Oh you're that guy  Yes it is 
[02:30:00]  That guy  Oh  I'm sorry  The rest of the world  Thinks one song  But Joe thinks  It's the worst song  That was the one  Where they started  Sucking man  Because it got commercial  No that was their  First hit  And then everything  After that was great  They were great  After the hit  Like much like  Aha  Right  Take on me  I follow you on Twitter  That was in Brooklyn  Right?  Yeah  Yeah  Did you take pictures there  Or something?  Or maybe someone else did  Did I take pictures at the show? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah  And maybe someone else did  No but I  But I know you were there as well  The Faith No More Reunion show  I ran into a couple creeps  At the show actually  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Horrendous  No it was fucking insane  What was their song?  Epic  Epic was the big one  Yeah  This is the one you don't like?  No the song stinks  Why?  It's just cheesy  It's like a rap rock song  I don't dislike it  I just like  It's so overplayed  Probably the first time  Second time you heard it  You were probably like  Alright that's cool 
[02:31:00]  It fits the time  Yeah  That little rap  Rappy thing  Yeah they did it first  I give them that  Right?  Sort of?  Yeah  It's you know  Play  Danny  Can you play  What a Day  And see if A.O.P. likes it  I bet you like this song dude  This was on the only station  That really rocks  Oh of course it was  Yeah it was a biggie  For that one  You got it? 
[02:31:30]  I bet you like this song  This is  I hate it  I hate it  Give it a chance  Alright  Here it comes  Not really a sing-along 
[02:32:00]  You can't really sing-along to this one  I like one you can sing to  I would listen to this  But I wouldn't go out of my way to  You know what I mean?  I was a sick fan of them  Through college man  Were you really?  I was obsessed with them  This is crazy person music  What do you like?  It's very simple  I'm very simple  I put on lithium  And just listen to fucking  Old 90's music  I just picture you 
[02:32:30]  I picture you sitting in that big house  Alone with a bottle of whiskey  With Gordon Lightfoot playing  Gordon Lightfoot  Carefree highway  I don't need that big city  I know  I love that song  Sun down  You better take care  Is that what I'm listening to?  That's a great song  Can we hear that?  Just in that hot tub  Yeah, yeah  In the big jacuzzi  Just playing like  Friggin old songs  Here I am 
[02:33:00]  Yeah  Nice  Picking up pieces  Of my sweet shadow dream  I so put this on my iPhone  I gotta put this on my Sonos queue  Hey Danny  What are you doing, man?  Nothing  What are you doing?  Listening to Gordon, bro  Come on over 
[02:33:30]  Hey, why don't you come over, Danny?  I'm drinking a few beers  Listening to some Gordon Lightfoot  And the jacuzzi  Just got his greatest hits  What was that shit  The Rosa was playing  On the show today?  Fucking  No more stuff  It was dog shit  It's not that far off  This is music  It's not that far off  Exactly  That's funny  I like how you picked this song  That's great  Hey Joe, is it true that 
[02:34:00]  Is it true what?  Smells Like Teen Spirit  Was the Pixies ripping off  Nirvana ripping off the Pixies  Yeah, Kurt Comayne said that  He said when he wrote that song  He was trying to write a Pixies song  Really?  Mm-hmm  Which one?  Smells Like Teen Spirit  The big one  Yeah, which Pixies song  Was he trying to write?  All of them  Every single one of them  You know the Pixies  Which one sounds the most  Like fucking Smells Like Teen Spirit  It sounds like  If Smells Like Teen Spirit  Wasn't as produced as it was 
[02:34:30]  It would sound like  An average Pixies song  Yeah  Which one  But that's the thing  You know all the songs  Give me a  Like, you know, like Debaser  Or, you know  Play a Pixies song  Like Debaser  Play Debaser  Debaser  Yeah  I like how music breaks  Like, listen how the verse  Goes into the chorus in this  That's what I'm talking about  Like that whole thing there 
[02:35:00]  Like the Pixies  They always do that  It's like  Like their documentary  Was called  Loud Quiet Loud  Yeah, yeah, yeah 
[02:35:30]  I didn't hear this  Yeah, like all their music  Is like  This isn't the best example  But they bring it down  And then they bring it way up  And then they bring it down again  Like that Monkey Gone to Heaven song  I definitely see the influence in that  Yeah  I actually don't mind that  Oh, they're fucking awesome  Like this is  I would like the Pixies  I would like the Pixies  I never really listen to them  Like they have to  Posthumously change their name  Or something  Are they still around?  They did a reunion thing 
[02:36:00]  A couple years ago  But they're not together  That's  Frank Black's still out there though  He's the guy  Kevin from Connecticut  Saying we know  Here Comes Your Man  Yeah, that's a  You definitely know that song  Yeah  I think that was in a couple  Fairley Brothers  They're like a band called  The Pixies  And they have a song called  Here Comes Your Man  Yeah, yeah  I love that  The Pixies were huge in England  We know that  So scurvy  Shut up  I know the Pixies are  Huge influence for a lot of bands  I know that much  You know this song, right? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, I've heard this song  Yeah, this has been in like  I've heard it  Shit loads of stuff  What's amazing about these bands though  Is like  It happened with the Pixies  It happened with Faith No More  And it happened with Pavement  They reached a certain  Did you not put Faith No More in there?  No, no  I'll accept the other two  They reached a certain  Faith No More was a one hit wonder  Hold on  Take it easy 
[02:37:00]  I know what you're doing  I know what you're doing  You're trying to get me here  My name is  You're trying to get me here  Name a second Faith No More song  You're doing Professor X  And Magneto right now  I know you're playing around in here  Xavier  And I'm not  Let me in  I got my helmet on  I've had an open mind  About everything else you've said  I never got into Faith No More  That other song  You turned me on to  Sure  I would listen to that  Yes  But these bands  Like they reached a certain  Cult status or whatever  Almost  I get little more than cult status  When they were together 
[02:37:30]  And then they broke up  Ten years goes by  They get back together  And all of a sudden  They're selling out  Like  Dude, when I saw Pavement  When they were still together  I saw them at like  The Trocadero in Philly  Toward the end of their career  That's maybe a thousand people  Maybe  Yeah  At tops  Dude, they played  This week  They played a show  At the Brooklyn Waterfront  On Sunday night  It was packed  Five sold out shows  At Central Park  At that stage  How the fuck  How the fuck does that happen  Like they get  That's what happened 
[02:38:00]  To the Pixies  They were playing  Smaller venues  They left  Came back  And they were headlining  Like Coachella  It was like fucking crazy  Like people get rabid  About it  It's so weird  It is weird  Yeah, maybe I should take  A ten year break  From comedy  I thought you were  Aren't you in the middle of that  Why would you set yourself  Up like that  I know, I know  I started with a hiatus  But here's a question  So Pavement  That 
[02:38:30]  Obviously  Obviously the youth  Have to be rediscovering Pavement  Joe  Because you're not  You don't have middle aged guys  Selling out these fucking shows  I gotta be honest with you  The two nights I was there  They were  They were  Maturing hipsters  They weren't young people  Yeah  Maturing hipsters  Yeah, they weren't  Do you consider yourself  A hipster?  No  No, but you know  What's funny to me was  He wants to be a hipster  At the Brooklyn waterfront  Everybody was throwing  All their trash 
[02:39:00]  There were trash cans everywhere  And everybody was just  Throwing their beer cans  And shit on the ground  And I go to my friend  I go  These hipsters are really  Fucking green  Until their favorite band  Is played  Yeah, then they just  Fucking throw shit around  I don't got time  Cut your hair's coming on  This fucking can out of my face  Time to be green, man  Hipsters  Yeah  You know what?  I'm not into the hipster thing  No, it sucks  I'm shocked  Yeah, I know, right?  I don't even know what bands  Come to the New York area anymore 
[02:39:30]  Every band  I'm losing it  Because something like that  I probably would have  Checked out  Why not?  I've heard of them before  Dude, they're playing  Three more nights  Two more nights in Central Park  You can still go  If you want to see it  Joe's still at the point  Where he knows  Like the bands  That are coming in  And where they're playing  How many nights  Probably recite this  Set list  I love those guys  They opened up with  Oh, totally that guy  And they just go through  And then it was like  The fucking  First encore  The second encore  Knows every song 
[02:40:00]  On the set list  I'm totally that guy  I can recite  Like the set list  Really?  Then I hate you  That's fucking weird  I always hated that guy  To me  When they compare  The set list of each show  Well, when I saw them  They didn't do it that way  But that's the fun  They actually flipped  Those two songs  That's crazy  They would do that  Then the second night  They opened with  That's the fun of the show  Like, I don't understand  When somebody goes to a concert  And I go, what'd they open with?  And they go, I can't remember  It's like, you can't remember  Like, that's the best part  Of the show  Like, that's the money shot  Of the fucking show 
[02:40:30]  Right, when the lights go down  Opening song  Why does every band  Have to suck at the  Three-quarter mark  Of their concert?  It does  Why?  You know what?  They start out unbelievable  It's the dynamic  They give you a little  Sit-down time  Which is nice  But then the sit-down time  Continues  Because then it's  Horseshit  And then the last quarter  Of the show  They finish strong  Every band does it  I don't think, dude  I don't think  Well, first of all  I think there's just  The general energy flow  That the show's gotta go in  You know what I mean?  You gotta dip at some point 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, they have a dynamic to it  But I also think  That's us getting old  So you have to purposely suck  I think that's us getting old, dude  Nah, man  I even remember  As a young kid  Going to shows  It's like, why?  Why are we sitting now?  There's no reason to sit  You need a break  You can't, you know  What do you want it?  Robin Williams energy  For 90 minutes?  Sit down  I wanna sit  And I wanna see  Sit down in the front  But all of a sudden  I'm tired  At every show  It comes that point  Where you see the entire place  Slowly sitting down  Like, oh, okay  It's time to sit  For 20 minutes 
[02:41:30]  I like that little break, man  I don't like  I don't like  It's usually the new songs  They're trying out  Unfortunately  Oh, yeah  You know what the worst is  When a band opens  With a new song  It's like, what are you doing?  Stop it  You put the new shit  In the middle  Yeah, yeah  Don't fucking open  With a new song  Unless it's on  Every radio station  Then you can, I guess  Then it's popular  Right, right  Yeah, I can't stand that  Opening up with a new song  Yeah  Closing with a new song  I saw a band  A couple weeks ago  That closed with a new song  Oh  Who was it?  It was the Bouncing Souls 
[02:42:00]  They're a punk band  But, like  They have so many  More songs  Oh, is that why  You couldn't come over  My house?  That's correct  Yeah, I remember that  What'd you have going on?  A little fucking Gordon?  Eh, a little Gordon Lightfoot  What are some of those  Other Gordon songs?  I was playing  Read My Mind, I think  Actually  Read Your Mind  What was that?  I only know those two  I know  Oh, you said that one  I'm sorry  Yeah, and if you could  Read my mind  Yeah  You should have seen  When we threw on  Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald  For a while  What a great song that is 
[02:42:30]  I fucking love it, man  I love it  It's great  You want to come over  And fire my guns  To the Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald  We'll just play that  Yeah  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  And I went to the boat  And we cast off the line  It's a whole fucking epic 
[02:43:00]  I was listening to the best of  When we did this  And just ripped this song apart  For an hour  And it's like  It's the sinking of this ship  In real time  This fucking song  Like, get your goomy  Is this  Is this his  The day the music died?  This is his epic?  Absolutely, yeah  He picked a ship  That no one knew  Or gave a fuck about  Who cared about  The Edmund Fitzgerald  You don't know how many shipwrecks there were  Oh my god  Forget about it  He just picked one obscure one 
[02:43:30]  Why don't you run with the Titanic?  Right  The one that we know  Was that one taken already?  Yeah  Everyone knew that one  This is 20 years before James Cameron  Throw on a fucking Titanic 2  Nobody would have cared  The ship was tossed on its three hour tour  As the minnow took on some water  The professor took a lifeboat  And went with Gilligan  But the skipper, he stayed with the ship  Hey Gordon, as your agent  I need to advise you 
[02:44:00]  Did you see what Dylan did  With that song Hurricane?  We need something like that  Yeah  You got something you really care about  That you can sing about for 15 minutes?  You know  The Edmund Fitzgerald, man  What?  Who's Edmund Fitzgerald?  Nah, it's a boat  Don't you wish you were at that pitch meeting?  It sunk  Who's Edmund Fitzgerald?  Who's Edmund Fitzgerald?  He brings in encyclopedias for everybody  I have pamphlets right here  Right  Very interesting  He hands them out to all the record executives  Now, hear me out, man 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, Gorg, do me a favor  Shove this song idea up your dickhole  And go write another thing about a highway  Would you please?  The dawn came late  And all right  Here he goes  And the storms of November  Some asshole we found out  From a special on Discovery  Left the fucking hatches open  And that's why it sunk  Dummy  Less to do with the storm 
[02:45:00]  Than a stupid crew man  And the hatch was left open  And they were dead iron ore  Which isn't light  This is why  This is like that Irish shit  This is like Irish music  It's like  Yeah  It's something when you're so fucking shit cocked at the bar  Yeah  You're like, yeah, let's just sing something over and over for 20 minutes  Like, what else are we gonna do?  I'm fucking wasting  There's no change in the music at all  Yeah  It's just, you know 
[02:45:30]  Yeah  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah  I could, I'd play this  Here we go  This is the song a leprechaun sings to you 
[02:46:00]  Before he gives you a riddle about his treasure  About his gourd  Or kills you  We should replay the original version of this  Oh, God  The time we fucked with it  Don't they sing this in, though, yeah  Don't they sing this in Lord of the Rings?  Where they go to that tavern?  Oh, Joe, thanks for giving us material today, man  This is crazy  Joe DeRosa is gonna be at the Gotham Comedy Club here in New York City  This Friday and Saturday 
[02:46:30]  A lot of shows, too, man  At the Gotham Comedy Club this Saturday  Joe DeRosa will be there  He could sing anything to that song  Five shows of pussy jokes and say in the cunt  In front of his patterns  You mentioned Hurricane, that's a good song  That's a fucking great song  Yeah, I love the Dylan  It's fucking great  You know, I gotta say, though, I'm not a big Dylan 
[02:47:00]  Don't crucify me  What about subterranean homesick blues?  I'm not gonna crucify you  I know he's a genius  I think that motherfucker, too, he's not  You don't like fucking Dylan?  No, I don't like anybody  How about his music?  Tremendous respect  I have a great respect for the guy  I just don't like listening to his music  Why?  It's like the Stones  Like, I think they're an amazing band  But I just never want to listen to it  Yeah  Worst concert I ever saw?  Bob Dylan  Really?  Oh, yeah  Really?  Was it his last Christmas album tour? 
[02:47:30]  The fucking audacity of that asshole  Audacity?  Well, that's what it's about  The audacity of this fucking guy  I've told him that story, too  It was way back in Rochester, New York  Finger Lakes Performing Arts Center  Early 90s, I'm thinking  And I'm like, holy shit, I get to see fucking Bob Dylan  Dude, he rearranges all his songs  You don't even know what you're hearing  Really?  And then someone's like, that was subterranean homesick blues 
[02:48:00]  And you're like, really?  No  He changes it so much, you don't recognize the song  You have to pick up on the lyrics and go  Oh, I see what he's doing here  So does he change the melody and everything?  This is a memory that goes way back now  But like Rolling Stone, all that  He just fucking redid it  And people were basically booing  They're like, what the fuck, dude?  Could you sing one that sounds like what we know?  Well, yeah  I don't mind when they get experimental with some of their shit  But not the whole concert  Yeah, Ant's not a fan of that at all 
[02:48:30]  I hate when they vary in the least bit from the album  I want to hear it exactly like it sounded when I heard it  Yeah, you know  And don't turn the mic toward the audience ever  Oh, I can't stand that  I can't stand that  Because I know 90% of the singers do it  Because they can't hit the fucking note  Yeah, I get angry about that  And Metallica, one of the best bands I've ever seen live, ever  One of the best shows ever  And Hetfield delivers, he can do it  Oh, yeah  But there's certain songs where he really just lets the crowd take it 
[02:49:00]  And it'll be like Master of Puppets  Like, Master of Puppets  But I want to hear  And then the crowd goes  Pulling your straight  You know  Yeah, yeah, yeah  No, I want to fucking hear you sing that part  I know  Do they give you a check on the way out?  For helping out the band?  Yeah  Do they have everybody a dollar or something?  Yeah  Well, the crowd sings it  And then Lars accuses everybody of trying to steal their music  Yeah, exactly  There's nothing worse than  You know  Yeah  You don't want to hear the audience go  You know it's sad but true 
[02:49:30]  You know that line?  Yeah, exactly  That's like  That's like the fucking line of the song  Yeah, yeah  Not fucking the audience yell it out  I need help from my girl right now  I'll write her  Uh-oh  We were at a street fair  And there was a horrendous band playing  And we were walking through with the kid and stuff  Just enjoying our afternoon, whatever, right?  And this band, hoping they can make it  They're doing covers  And they did exactly that  Where they put the mic out  And no one sang 
[02:50:00]  Oh, that's great  It was the biggest douche chill moment I've seen in a while  I forgot what song it was, though  It was some really lame-ass, who-gives-a-shit fucking song  Not as good as the Warrant fucking  Oh, yeah  What's the Warrant thing?  Warrant, reunion  Like, and it was  And the drummer's like fucking, you know  Still doing the whole spinning the sticks  And fucking the head's going  And he stands up and like fucking  And throws his sticks into the crowd  There was no one there 
[02:50:30]  You heard the stick go  Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink  On the floor  Yeah  No one caught it  Because he threw it past the crowd  That was scorched next to the stage  Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink  You heard the stick hit the funnel cake  At the state fair stand  That they were fucking playing in front of  That's so embarrassing  Exact, yeah  They're the exact opposite  We were talking about before  You're like, there's less people here  Than when you guys were together  Yeah  They just  Those 80s bands can't really get it together 
[02:51:00]  As far as the  Secondary hair bands  They don't get  Dude  Oh, the craziest  Craziest  You want to talk about crazy  So crazy you had to take your headphones off  Yeah  Yeah  Because I got to get into this thought here  Head bugs  The  Head bugs  Head bugs  I got  Head bugs  They talk  Fuck  Oh, VH1  I was watching like  Top 100 hard rock acts  Or whatever  And they were  They showed a clip  One of the acts was Skid Row  And they show a clip from an interview 
[02:51:30]  Like from a year ago  Of Sebastian Bach going  Yeah, man, you know  I'm still out there touring, man  You know  Not with Skid Row  I'm solo  And he goes  You know  There was a little while  Where I got knocked out of the box  By, you know  Like Nirvana  And stuff  But hey  In the end  Rock won  What?  What the fuck?  He was on Celebrity Fit Club  He didn't win anything  First of all  Rock lost  First of all  It's like  Dude, you're literally talking about Nirvana 
[02:52:00]  Like if that  Like you're taking  He blew his head off  Out of the fucking equation  Right, right  That could have contributed to them  Like not being around  Yeah  Him killing himself  Right  Yeah  What a dolt  Yeah, he made it sound like  He dropped a new album  And that's why Kurt Cobain  Put the fucking gun in his mouth  It's like  Yeah, his genre never came back  After fucking  Kurt blew his brains out  What?  The best thing I ever saw with Skid Row  Was an interview they were doing  And they were talking about the 
[02:52:30]  The heyday  And just bottles of Jack Daniels everywhere  And shit like that  And then they showed him touring  Recently  And they're packing up the Jack Daniels  Like pouring it all together  Back into one bottle  And they used to just leave the Jack  In the dressing room  Right  Hit the bus  And just take off  Now they're packing the booze up  And like taking the sandwiches and shit  From the dressing room  They really just 
[02:53:00]  Oh, that's great  Oh, that's fucking hilarious  Yeah, things kind of changed  Rock stars act like your Nana  Can I go  Can I go back to Dylan for a second  Because this guy reminded me of something else he does  Go ahead, Matt  White Plains  Oh my God  I waited outside in the rain for two hours  To see this guy  He comes on stage  Doesn't say a word to the crowd  Plays  He could have been singing in Chinese  I had no idea what he was doing  Stops  Doesn't even look at the crowd 
[02:53:30]  Walks off stage and leaves  Why everyone's sitting there getting stalked and wet for two hours  He's a legend  Fuck him  Yeah, he doesn't acknowledge the crowd  I do remember that  He kind of just looks down  Or, I don't know  He just  I'm so annoyed too  With every celebrity  That like runs  To be in his shitty movies  That he writes  And they literally will say things like  I just want to speak his words  It's like  He's not Christ  Like  I want to speak his words 
[02:54:00]  I'm glad you're speaking them  Because I can't fucking understand them  When he speaks them  When he says it  You don't know what the fuck you're saying  Exactly  I know  I wanted to punch my own dick earlier  When I'm like  Does he change the melody?  What fucking melody?  Does he rearrange the mush?  The weirdest thing with Dylan  Was like  All of his songs  And then there was  Lay across my big brass bed  Which is my favorite Dylan song  He's like  He just  Actually you hear every word 
[02:54:30]  It doesn't sound like Dylan  And everyone else is  What the fuck?  What was that one song  He decided  I'm going to be articulate  Yeah  It's funny how articulate it gets  When he's talking about pussy  Lay, lay, lay  Now he's trying to get laid  All of a sudden  It all clears up quick  Doesn't it?  Does he still do his radio show?  I was a fan of his radio show for a while  I haven't heard it in well over a year  I just forgot about it one day  He had a radio  Oh that's right  Yeah but he played  A lot of weird shit  A lot of people 
[02:55:00]  Don't even know  This is Dylan  I didn't  You know  I guess I knew  But I didn't know  This is like  If that makes sense  Like he makes  It doesn't sound like him  Right  He's like  Lay  Lay across my big brass bed  He's not like  Lay, lay, lay  Lay across my big brass bed  Yeah  Do you ever hear  Isaac Hayes do this?  No  There's an Isaac Hayes cover of this  Probably a lot more  Fucking  Funky  Funky  Yeah  Groove to it  Yeah but it's  It's still this song 
[02:55:30]  You know what I mean?  And then it gets  It gets up high  Whatever colors you have  In your mind  It's like singing  I show them to you  You know what?  If you just  If you played this right now  And said who does this  I don't think I would have  Came up with Dylan  Now that I think about it  Yeah  No  I think I would have  Been tricked  I would have thought  It was Gordon Lightfoot  Even though we know  It's Dylan  Yeah  It sounds like  Seriously  Yeah yeah  A little bit  A little bit  A little bit  So if you're  Playing at my house  Stay with me 
[02:56:00]  Danny what are you doing man?

[02:58:30]  That's just dumb  On his part  Quit while you're ahead  Why would you do that  Quit while you're ahead  Quit while you're ahead  Means hanging up  Before you finish  Dialing this fucking number  Dude  Being around  All of you guys  Has gotten me  To the point  Where when I'm  Even when I'm  Killing on stage  I want to just stop  I'm like  I don't trust  That I can keep  This going right now  I can't keep this  Pace up  Something's gonna bomb  Eventually  I want to just  Fucking leave  Holy shit  We were  We were sitting here

[03:10:30]  Hanging out  You can drink  It's great  Which is when you make  Your most sensible  Dining decisions  By the way  It's like 3am  Hammered off your ass  You're gonna eat  Some real healthy food  And then pass out  For 12 hours  Yeah  Just so it can sit there  With zero metabolism  And just absorb  Into your body  Yeah  And you're trying  To hit on chicks  You got barbecue sauce  Over your fingers  You're fucking drunk  Oh shit  Worst burger ever  For my bowels  Was Jackson Hole burgers

[03:39:30]  Fine  With  I  Have  To  See  The  First  Episode  I  Don't  Even  Care  About  The  Old  Characters  Because  You  Got  A  Whole  Bunch  Of  New  Ones  But  I  Was  Such  A  Fan  But  Then  The  Show  Went  Away  For  So  Long  We  Figured  It  Out  Yesterday  I  Think  It  Went  Away  For  18  Month  That  Start  Scaring  Me  I  Think  Wow  All  These  Guys  Had  To  Move  On  To  Other  Projects  By  Now  HBO  Was  A  Little  Slow  To  Pick  It  Up  After  The  First  Season  And  Jody  And  Myself  The  Other  Guy  We  Both  Went  On  To  Other  Projects  Other  Movies  And  Then  They  Picked  It  Up  And  We  Really  Enjoy  Working 
[03:40:00]  On  We  Have  A  Blast  With  It  It  It  Just  All  Of  Our  Buddies  January  This  Year  And  Then  Just  Went  For  It  And  We've  Been  Working  On  It  I  Guess  For  This  Whole  Year  Now  I  Guess  We're  Almost  Finished  Yeah  I'm  Just  Glad  It's  Back  It  Had  A  Cult  Following  So  I  Don't  Really  Understand  Why  HBO  Took  So  Long  To  Pick  It  Up  For  Second  Season  And  Then  I'm  Watching  You  And  Every  Every  Movie  Out  There  I'm  Like  There's  No  Way  He's  Going  Back  To  East  Bounding 
[03:40:30]  Now  But  Of  Course  You  Have  And  We're  All  Happy  For  That  HBO  Does  That  Man  They'll  Take  Like  I  Remember  They  Did  That  With  Curb  A  Couple  Times  It  Was  Like  Over  A  Year  Before  It  Came  Back  That  Takes  A lot  Of  Balls  To  Think  That  The  Fans  Are  Going  To  Stick  Around  That  Long  For  Some  Of  Of  Show  I  Think  With  That  Show  We  Ran  Into  A  Lot  Of  Trouble  When  We  Made  That  First  Season  Once  You  Start  Turning  Episodes  In  I  Don't  Think  They  Were  Prepared  For  What  We  Were  Doing  They  Didn't  Really  Know  If  That  Character  Would 
[03:41:00]  Work  Since  He  Was  So  Unlikable  So  I  Think  The  Jury  Was  Out  Whether  They  Wanted  To  Be  In  Business  With  Us  Or  Not  But  When  People  Kind  Of  Responded  To  It  I  Think  Since  It  A  Lot  Of  People  Have  Found  It  And  Yeah  So  They  Gave  Us  Another  Shot  This  Season  And  They  Been  Amazing  Like  They  Let  Us  Do  Whatever  We  Want  And  Have  Been  Nothing  But  Supportive  So  It's  Been  Really  Cool  Working  With  The  First  Episode  Out  Out  Funny  You  Gotta  Settle  Something  For  Us  And  I  Already  Know  The  Answer  But  What 
[03:41:30]  Point  Off  And  On  For  Months  I  Mean  She's  She's  She's  A  Beautiful  Woman  But  There  Are  People  In  Hollywood  That  Have  A  Nice  Body  Part  And  They  Use  Them  In  Movies  And  TV  Shows  You  Know  A  Pair  Of  Good  Tits  Danny  McBride  I'm  Not  Talking  To  Kenny  Powers  I'm  Talking  To  Danny  McBride  Wore  Those  Stunt  Tits  Okay  I'm  Going  to  Level 
[03:42:00]  With  You  They  Were  Yeah  That's  So  Disappointing  That  I  Was  Like  Almost  Running  With  A  Boner  To  The  Movie  Theater  To  See  Machete  Cause  I  Heard  Lindsay  Lohan  Showed  Her  Boobs  In  It  And  Somebody  Was  Like  It's  Not  Her  Tits  And  I  Was  Like  Fuck  That  Movie  Yeah  Shows  A snatch  Getting  Out  Of

[03:43:30]  Amazing  To  Watch  Steve  Little  On  The  Set  This  Year  Because  Usually  When  People  Do  Nude  Scenes  You  Know  The  Whole  Crew  Standing  Around  The  First  Thing  You  Want  To  Do  When  They  Yell  Cut  Is  Get  A  Robe  On  Just  Get  Out  Of  There  You  Know  And  And  He  Kind  Of  Found  This  Sense  Of  Like  Confidence  Like  After  His  Sexy  He  Just  Kind  Was  Standing  On  The  Set  Nude  Just  Like  Kind  Of  Looking  At  Everybody  Button  His  Shirt  Up  Really  Lowly  Like  He  Was  Empowered  By  It  Sounds  Like  You  You  Have  A  Great  Time  And  She  Was  Pretty  Good  As  The  Hooker  Was  That

[03:44:30]  Be  Nice  Danny  You  Don't  Have  To  Comment  But  I'm  About  To  Say  Something  That's  Going  To  Make  You  Very  Happy  Okay  You  Are  Way  Funnier  Than  Steve  Carell  That  Is  Not  Big  Shoes  To  Fill  Never  Got  To  Steve  Carell  My  Friend  Never  Got  It  You  Don't  Like  The  Corral  Don't  Like  I  Like  The  When  He  Was  On  The  Daily  Show  I'll  Give  him  That  And  I  Like  The  First  Season  I  Know  You  Have  To  Say  That  Danny  You're  A  Big  Hollywood  Guy  And  And  It'll  Be  Noted  That  You  Said  That  So  Don't  Worry  About  But  I'm  Saying  You're  Way  Funnier  Than  Steve  You  Tell  Me
