<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them with frequent vulgar and sexually explicit jokes.  The show began with a post-game analysis of NFL playoff games, focusing heavily on Brett Favre's crucial interception and the controversial overtime rules.  The hosts vehemently criticized Favre's play, repeatedly using phrases like "beat the shit out of him," and proposed various alternative overtime rules.  They also mocked Governor David Paterson's reaction to the game, making fun of his blindness.  The Jets' loss to the Colts and Peyton Manning's performance were also discussed.  This segment included several callers offering their opinions on the games and rules, often contributing their own crude humor and tangents about regional foods like lutefisk and bacalau,  a poorly received Saints fight song, and the quality of pizza in different regions. One caller, Brooks, briefly mentioned a family christening coinciding with a football game. The hosts also extensively mocked the seemingly absurd bet between the mayors of New York City and Indianapolis after the Colts' victory.

The show then shifted to a discussion about a dessert compared to nuclear fallout, followed by a sports statistic from a caller, Kevin from Connecticut, about Brett Favre's interceptions. The hosts briefly touched on a forgotten radio bit ("toot-a-ly-doo") before discussing *Avatar*'s box office success and the merits of 3D technology.  This led to a critique of Hollywood remakes, particularly the upcoming *Spider-Man*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Karate Kid* remakes, and the perceived trend of casting Black actors in these remakes. The discussion included a caller noting James Cameron's resemblance to the Quaker Oats man. The conversation then turned to Gary Coleman’s arrest and other celebrity mugshots (Nick Nolte was mentioned), followed by speculation about Brad and Angelina’s rumored breakup, with Ian Halperin, a frequent guest, mentioned for his earlier prediction.

Halperin then called in, reiterating his Brangelina breakup prediction and detailing his theory of how it would unfold, mentioning rumors of Angelina Jolie having affairs with both men and women.  The conversation descended into vulgar jokes about Jennifer Aniston’s alleged body odor.  Halperin also gave updates on Tiger Woods’ sex rehab, predicting the end of his marriage.  The segment concluded with a review of *Up in the Air*, criticizing its plot and excessive product placement, and clips from Conan O’Brien's final show on NBC, featuring Will Ferrell and a Lynyrd Skynyrd performance.

A significant portion of the show focused on a scathing review of "Up in the Air" from a caller named Jimmy, who vehemently criticized the film's plot, acting, and product placement.  The hosts and other callers largely agreed, using highly offensive language.  The discussion also included equally harsh critiques of the "Sex and the City 2" trailer and the Haiti telethon, punctuated by an anecdote about a caller vomiting into a popcorn bag during a "Sex and the City 2" preview.  Ozzy Osbourne's upcoming in-studio appearance was mentioned, along with a discussion about a woman damaging a Picasso painting.

Another segment heavily featured listener calls about the Haiti telethon, focusing on celebrity appearances and reactions, with repeated jokes about Jennifer Aniston’s alleged “smelly cunt.” A call with a Presbyterian pastor who spoke with Steven Spielberg during the telethon was played.  The discussion shifted to the death of "Chemical Ali," then back to the telethon with more listener calls and jokes about celebrities like Lucy Liu and Jack Nicholson.  The hosts speculated on the cost of securing a celebrity call. A call discussing a granddaughter with spina bifida elicited crude jokes.  The segment also discussed Andy Dick's arrest for alleged sexual assault, a hand grip product with sexually suggestive puns, and the Jersey Shore cast's salary demands, interspersed with listener calls and off-color jokes about Snooki and Christina Aguilera, and a hoax involving Rickroll emails to a Christian TV channel.

The show concluded with a discussion about reality TV, specifically praising *Joe Schmo*, lamenting its cancellation, and focusing on Snooki, with a caller, Jason, claiming she's Chilean and adopted, leading to sexually suggestive comments about her appearance.  Ticket information for upcoming Opie and Anthony shows was announced, along with breaking news about a potential John Edwards sex tape.  The show ended with further sexually explicit comments about Snooki and a failed attempt to find a penis pump infomercial.

[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name.  Shit Radio.  All right.  We hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh my gosh.  And his face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butthole is.  That's funny.  This is Shit Radio.  And it fucking stinks.  It stinks.  I would imagine a lot of people are sleepy this morning. 
[00:04:30]  I would imagine a lot of people are sleepy this morning.  From all those fucking football games over the weekend.  From all those fucking football games over the weekend.  Watch a little football.  A lot of Monday morning quarterbacking going on today.  Not really though if you think about it.  Yes.  The games ended like they were supposed to end.  No.  But you'll get the Monday morning quarterbacking on some individual plays.  The Brett Favre play at the end of the game.  That was a biggie.  That fucker should have ran that ball.  I think everyone's in agreement.  Yeah.  And then he throws that interception.  Force an overtime.  And then forget it.  Saints win. 
[00:05:00]  Did they get the ball at all in overtime with the Vikings?  Uh, no.  Saints did they win?  No.  They did not.  And I don't believe in the Jets game they should have gone for that long field goal.  I think they should have just punted.  Because that ended up being a touchdown for the Colts.  Which one?  I'm so confused now.  I believe it was like the first quarter, maybe the second.  He missed two.  Yeah, he missed two.  I know that.  But there was another long one where it was like, dude, punt the fucking ball.  Just punt it.  And they wound up running it back for it. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, that was like a, I think that was going to be a 52-yarder, right?  Yeah, but fucking punt it.  That's in range.  You're doing good.  No, I don't think they should have done that.  Doesn't matter.  The Colts were the better team.  I know, I know.  I'm just saying individual plays, obviously.  I think that was kind of a silly thing to do.  I mean, Peyton Manning throws for almost 400 yards.  You're not going to win.  You're not going to win the game.  Yeah.  You're just not going to win the game.  True.  I think the biggest.  That's off.  I think the biggest play of the weekend, though, was the Brett Favre thing. 
[00:06:00]  Brett Favreau.  Throwing that interception when it looked like he could just run down the sideline for 10,  15 yards.  And then they could fucking kick the field goal and go to the Super Bowl.  When you've been assaulted, literally in the legal sense of the word, assaulted by another  team the whole game, I think he was a little scared to even run.  Right.  They beat the shit out of him.  He took some shots, didn't he? 
[00:06:30]  Oh, my God.  Did he take some massive hits.  And he didn't even have the ball at that point.  Like, there were so many late hits.  They were snapping, and he was like, boom, just throw.  Just get rid of the ball.  It's hysterical.  Beat the shit out of him.  Can I play again?  I want to see if he really could have run.  And, yeah, look, it's wide open.  All he has to do is get to that 30-yard line.  You're right.  You're right.  But there was a player.  I don't know if he could have gotten that far.  He could have gotten out of bounds over there.  Yeah, but he's already at the 40.  Even if he gets to the 35, they have a shot. 
[00:07:00]  A 52-yarder because it's the end of the game, too, so they have nothing to lose.  They go for it at that point.  Yeah.  A long field goal.  At least he gives you a chance, right?  Yeah.  Because they never got the ball in overtime.  Which is another thing they're bringing up.  A lot of people are all pissed at that overtime rule.  The sudden death in football, it shouldn't be.  You win that coin toss, you're in pretty good shape.  You win the coin toss, yes, yes.  I'd like to know the stats.  Overtime stats, how many teams that win the coin toss win the fucking game? 
[00:07:30]  Danny's good, but I don't know.  Are you that good, Danny?  Danny's fucking good.  Danny goes, yeah, I think so.  Look at him go.  Look at him go.  Because it shouldn't be that way, dude.  It should, you know, they should be able to play for a limited time.  Give him what?  Give him a quarter?  A few minutes?  Whatever.  They probably should play a short quarter.  Short quarter?  Yeah.  You knock a couple minutes off the quarter, maybe.  Because it's like you win the coin toss, you get into field goal range.  Hey, thank you.  It's the only way to stop a tie from going on, though.  Because if you allow... 
[00:08:00]  I've heard the argument where both teams should get at least one possession.  But field goal, field goal.  Touchdown, touchdown.  All right.  Then there's no way to guarantee that it tied us in the game.  How about this?  Short quarter, then sudden death.  Then sudden death.  Because then at least you give, you know, both teams a chance to score.  A chance, maybe.  Fox was saying that Favre had a clear 10 yards to run.  Maybe.  Ah, all.  And they blamed it on the Democrats?  And Fox, what?  Yes.  Enjoy the Jets shirts, fucking Haiti. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, Haiti's going to love those.  And the Viking shirts, for that matter.  Right.  Enjoy the NFL shirts, Haiti.  I'm happy my Saints are in.  I mean, it's been a long time coming.  I've been suffering for years.  Who do you want in the Super Bowl, Saints or the Colts?  Saints, because they've never gone.  That's true.  Never been to the Super Bowl.  Yeah, so I didn't hate seeing them go.  I just kind of felt bad for Favre.  Yeah.  On paper, it looks like it'll be a fine Super Bowl, though, huh?  Yeah.  Two high-powered offenses going at it.  They usually say a nice defense wins the Super Bowl, but I guess maybe not this year. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Because you've got two teams that just love to freaking score.  Am I going out on a limb saying Manning's pretty good?  He can seem to toss the ball to his pals.  I was in a hardcore Jets environment yesterday, and you could just feel it in the room, like  at the end of that second quarter, the wheels were starting to get wobbly.  They weren't falling off yet.  But you knew there was a problem with the wheels as you're riding down the highway.  After the first quarter, you're like, holy shit, look at these Jets. 
[00:09:30]  Jets played all right, man.  They're fucking doing good.  This is great.  And then second quarter, by the end of it, you're like, hey, hey, hey, no, they get in  the locker room.  It's still a close game.  It's close.  But everyone's voice was getting a little higher.  We could do it.  It could happen.  It could happen.  Fuck.  John and Georgia might have the math problem solved here. 
[00:10:00]  Let's go to John and Georgia.  Johnny.  It's 53% of the time the team that wins the coin toss wins again.  53%.  That's a lot less than I thought it would be.  Yeah.  I assumed it would be higher than that.  But you know what?  There shouldn't be any chance with the coin toss.  You know what I mean?  Well, now from 2000 to 2007, regular season, there have been 124 overtime games.  And every single game except one, I believe it says, the team that won the toss elected 
[00:10:30]  to receive.  And those receiving teams won 60% of the time and tied once.  Now we're starting to look at a nice advantage.  They're probably figuring, look, your defense has to get it done the first.  It's sudden death is kind of exciting.  You've had four quarters.  You've got to do something.  But it just...  Extra inning, same way.  Although both teams...  Yeah.  Do both teams get it up in extra innings?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  You've got chances.  It just comes down to a coin toss and a field goal so many times, it seems. 
[00:11:00]  I don't like that it comes down to the coin toss.  Figure out who gets to choose if they want to, you know, receive or whatever.  Some other way.  Where they have to use their football skills.  Well, total offense, I don't know, whoever had a...  There's got to be a better way than just deciding on the coin toss, you know what I mean?  That's just pure luck.  Give it to the team that maybe played a little better in the actual game, stat-wise, or something.  That'll be rough.  I don't know.  I think they should just let them, you know, duke it out for another short quarter. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I was just reading just now, what some people would like to see happen is to, instead of  the first to score, it's the first to score six points, so that way a field goal can't  win it.  Oh, you need two field goals.  So you would need two field goals or a touchdown.  Oh!  You know what?  That works.  That makes fucking sense.  That fucking works right there.  First to score.  But again, I think the problem is you're going to wind up...  That works.  ...with a tie at the end of that quarter.  One field goal, one field goal.  Or, you know what?  Bring out the skinny field goal of, uh, uh, how about it? 
[00:12:00]  What?  You gotta, like, thin out the fucking...  Uprights.  Uprights.  Uprights.  Thank you.  It's just the size of a football.  Bring out the skinny ones.  And you can't punch it through.  You have to actually fire it out of your asshole.  That would be new special teams.  Imagine they bring out the skinny uprights.  Half the size.  All right.  Let's see how good you are now, fucker.  I like the six-point rule.  I like the six-point rule.  That's a good one.  Because you need a field goal.  Then the other team will go and go, look, we get a field goal. 
[00:12:30]  And then they get...  See, that would make you go for that fucking touchdown, too.  If one team gets the three points, right?  Now, the next team, you're going to want to score a touchdown.  Because if you just score a field goal, then the other team gets it.  And they get six points.  So it forces the second team up to try for a touchdown.  Who said Toyn Koss?  Was it me or you?  Could have been any of us.  Oh, my God.  Toyn Koss.  Who said it?  I got the biggest two-chilled. 
[00:13:00]  Could have been any of us.  Who said Toyn Koss?  Toyn Koss.  It's coming in too many times.  I don't even want to know, man.  I'll find out during the replay.  Ah, shit.  I would bet money it's me.  I don't know.  I could have done it.  I've said it a few times.  Once you say it a lot.  Fuck.  Ah, whatever.  Hey, man.  The games were on late for morning show hosts.  That's a late night 10.30 on a Sunday.  Quarter to 11.  Whatever the fuck it was.  Two games, you know.  Two.  Yeah.  Two.  I want to say two good games, but. 
[00:13:30]  Jets game was great for the first half.  Colts is better.  Jets game was great for Jets fans because you're going to hang in there.  But the average fan is probably done with that game, you know, pretty much in the third quarter.  It's over.  You can see it.  You can see the whole momentum turning.  When's the Super Bowl?  Two weeks.  What's the date of that?  Huh?  What's the date of that?  Uh, two weeks.  Third.  I would say the seventh.  Oh, okay.  Cool. 
[00:14:00]  That would be my guess.  Hmm.  Big game.  Let's go to Brian in Philly.  Big game.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Brian.  Just a simple, simple suggestion.  Just make the field goal kicker illegal in overtime.  So they, so you could only score a touchdown to get points.  That's even.  Well, no, I mean.  Take too long to break the tie.  Yeah.  What?  Touchdown, touchdown?  Yeah.  No, you're saying just make, you know, you can't, you can't kick field goals in overtime.  Nah, I like the six-point rule.  Yeah, you gotta get something from watching down the field a little bit. 
[00:14:30]  That makes sense.  I like the six-point rule.  And then if the other team can't pull it off, then, you know, the first team does it  again, and then they deserve to win.  It's not, at least, at least the other team gets to touch the fucking ball.  Do you think that call was interference late in the game yesterday?  That set up the Saints field goal?  Uh, I didn't see that one.  I thought they should just let them play hard in overtime.  I guess, I guess it was, but they could have kind of let it go. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, they, I think they shouldn't make as many, uh, unless they're obvious, you know,  calls, if you're trying to bulldog the quarterback with his, with his face mask or something.  Well, that's what they were doing.  Perhaps, uh.  Brett Favre.  Brett Favre took so many high hits.  He's a fucking tough guy, man.  Laying on his back, just fucked up.  He's a tough guy.  He's gotta be.  Absolutely.  Eight years old, he's out there getting pounded by, by thugs.  Yep.  By young thugs.  Let's say hi to Brooks, uh, the trucker. 
[00:15:30]  Brooks.  Oh.  He was here.  Good morning, Brooks.  Saw a truck once when I was a boy.  Let's get to the important question.  How was the christening?  Well, my brother did the right thing and made sure that, uh, we were at, back at his house  and time to fucking watch the Jets game, but.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  That christening thing is a waste of time.  Holy shit.  Kid doesn't even know what's going on.  Mm.  In the church. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, so who cares?  Yeah.  Uh, what are you gonna do?  I don't, I don't have much, I don't have much christening material, to be honest with you.  It was a christening.  I got to hang out with my family, which is always good.  They're all good eggs.  And, uh, you know, they lucked out, though.  My brother lucked out because this was a 3.30 start.  Yeah.  I thought it would be a 1 o'clock start, which was exactly when the christening started.  That would have been a problem.  That would have been a major problem.  But then you got the priest making Jets jokes and stuff. 
[00:16:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Let's get out of here.  You know, we got a game to watch.  God doesn't want that.  God doesn't want him talking about the Jets.  Joking a little about the Jets.  Did he give a prayer for the Jets?  Didn't work.  No, he didn't give a prayer.  But he wasn't that brave.  That's all I have on that.  What do you want from me?  Uh, let's say hi to Barry in Indiana.  Barry.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, uh, you know, with the football, what I think they should do is they should, uh,  have a club, a field goal kickoff in overtime. 
[00:17:00]  A few kickers get out there, start kicking field goals.  And every time they make one, they move a little bit further back.  And the first one to miss, that team lose.  That's like hockey, man.  Yeah, nobody wants a shootout.  I'm done with the hockey shootout.  We'll talk about that as the hockey season gets deeper and deeper into the season.  I'm not a fan of the shootout anymore.  But, I mean, I think you're onto something.  I think what they need to do is get, uh, the field goal kickers out on the field, right?  Yeah.  Right.  It's just, it's just the field goal kicker.  He's got a tee and the ball, both guys. 
[00:17:30]  And it's full contact between the two guys.  And the first one that's able to make a field goal from outside, I don't know, 35 yards,  that team wins.  With the guys, like, just completely...  Coming down on them.  Just completely assaulting each other.  They're trying to set up their tee.  Yeah, well, I make an even challenge.  Make the quarterback kick the field goal.  Then all of a sudden it turns into MMA and stuff.  You know, they're just beating the crap out of each other, hoping the guy will stay down 
[00:18:00]  the ground so that, then he can set up his tee and his little ball and kick it through  the uprights.  The skinny uprights, remember.  That's right.  Thank you, Barry.  All right, guys.  Peace out, man.  All right.  Uh, let's go to Rob in Connecticut.  Rob.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, buddy.  What you should do is go to the, uh, college rules.  You know, when, uh, 14 gets the ball on the 30 and, uh, you go from there and you go  back and forth until somebody wins the game.  Yeah, college has it figured out a little bit.  They, they, they do sort of what you're saying, Ant.  Yeah?  Yeah, both, uh, teams get the ball.  So.  The other thing, uh, with the Vikings game, there was absolutely fair. 
[00:18:30]  Vikings got the call with a coin toss and they lost it and things took over and won  the game.  Yeah, the Vikings did make the call.  That's right.  And lost the coin toss.  But you can't, to lose a coin toss and, and then the other team gets a pretty big advantage  is just, I don't know.  It doesn't seem right.  It really doesn't.  And look, I don't, I don't like the Vikings that much.  It would have been just kind of cool to see the Vikings in the damn thing.  You know, I'm, I'm, I get beat up some more.  That guy, I don't think he could have taken a Superbowl.  Well, that's why a lot of people say I have a sports curse. 
[00:19:00]  It really is.  I always go for the underdogs.  I'm a big underdog fan.  I always go for the underdog.  I wanted a fucking Jets Viking Superbowl.  That ain't happening.  No, it certainly wasn't.  All right, Rob.  Look at Brett Favre just limping off the field.  Yeah.  He played right to the end.  He was just like, how?  He had a pretty good game too, right?  He had over 300 yards.  Damn.  There's a great picture in the paper of Governor Patterson.  I saw that too. 
[00:19:30]  I'm so glad you're bringing this up.  He's got his hands up like he's shocked.  And it says, Governor Patterson reacts while watching Jets AFC Championship game against  Indianapolis Colts.  Why doesn't it just say listening to?  Of course.  Look at that.  He's facing the refrigerator.  He has no idea.  Right now, he's looking at the handle of a refrigerator.  And he's yelling, go Sanchez.  It's like it's a Bud Light commercial, Governor.  That's on. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, look at him.  I hate to watch the game with him.  Yeah!  What happened?  Nothing.  Just trying to fit in.  It just starts cheering, hoping it matches up to the play on the TV.  He's got his jersey on.  He's backwards.  He doesn't know.  It's not even a real Jets jersey.  It's an Emerson Booser jersey from 1969.  More importantly, what was the mayor's bet? 
[00:20:30]  We didn't talk about the mayor's bet.  Do they have the big mayor's bet?  Between New York and...  What did our dumb mayor here in New York City bet?  It's got to be so just embarrassing.  I bet you it's going to be a nice douche chill.  I think...  What did the mayor's bet?  I think the mayor's bet that Patterson will walk around wearing prescription glasses if the Jets lose.  And they'll do something about Down Syndrome in honor of the Mannings' face if the Colts lose.  Mannings are all ugly.  I think if the... 
[00:21:00]  They've got a lot of Super Bowls under their belt, those motherfuckers.  Holy shit, do they?  I guess it says something about being ugly.  I mean, they weren't able to date in high school.  They didn't get...  Okay, well...  I had a nice concert, but I just didn't feel like getting there.  Watching you say that, it was like watching a carpet unroll and you're running to try to get to the end of the rug and it just wasn't happening.  I'm tired for once, man.  I'm usually never tired.  Basically, you know, they didn't date in high school, so then they have more time to... 
[00:21:30]  Oh, you're not trying to get...  Throw the ball and...  Oh, no, you're not.  Well, now I'm just going...  I'm not even going for the joke.  Now I'm just going with a fact.  Were you the first time?  I don't know.  Did you sound like you were making a statement?  No.  Yes.  Yay.  Yes.  I had a nice, ugly concept that I just couldn't get together.  Let's see.  If the Jets won, Mayor Ballard would have sent Bloomberg's shrimp cocktail from St. Elmo's Steakhouse.  If Colts won, which they did, Mayor Bloomberg is going to send Ballard pizza from Danino's Pizza Place. 
[00:22:00]  But if the Jets won, they also would have gone into Indianapolis and completely closed down the Indianapolis Speedway and set up chairs for the homeless to sit in.  Asshole.  Pizza would be cold by the time it gets to Indianapolis.  Of course it will be, dummies.  The mayor bet is just so...  It's hack.  Bet a blowjob.  Make it really worth your while there.  Loser sucks the winner's cock.  Or vice versa if it's San Francisco, Vermont.  But why can't they get creative? 
[00:22:30]  Why does it have to be a food bet every time?  Why?  I know.  It's always some stupid New York...  Hey, New York pizza!  Against what?  Really?  And like Jimmy said, by the time it gets down there, someone really is going to eat it?  For real?  Yeah, who's eating that, by the way?  Who's going to eat the shrimp cocktail after it's traveled?  Traveled!  Philly, it's a cheesesteak if there's a Philadelphia team.  Call me silly.  Go ahead.  Is Indianapolis known for its shrimp?  No!  And it's a shrimping industry. 
[00:23:00]  It doesn't seem to me like a thing you'd want to get from Indianapolis.  Shrimp.  Well, let's get a Colts fan on the line.  I bet you it has something to do with Indianapolis.  Well, it might have something to do with it, but as far as edibility...  I don't know, man.  I mean, look at it.  I don't see one fucking piece of water that would have shrimp in it around there.  Where do they catch it?  They catch it on Route 74.  Danny just keeps going out with Google Earth, and the closest body of water is like one of  the Great Lakes in Chicago. 
[00:23:30]  The closest body of water is Chicago.  I just assumed there was water somewhere near my...  No, they actually eat land...  What the fuck?  They eat land shrimps.  They hang out.  They burrow into the shoulder of Route 74.  The very famous land shrimps.  They have little feet.  Why would they send shrimp?  There isn't a fucking...  They're landlocked.  Let's wait for the answer.  I guarantee a Colts fan will explain why...  I see two reservoirs.  Why shrimp.  I see two reservoirs.  I don't think they have reservoir shrimp. 
[00:24:00]  They probably raise shrimp in their toilet bowls or something.  Is that what they do?  That's horrific.  Is there a river?  Do shrimp live in rivers?  There's no shrimp.  There's no crawfish.  I don't know.  I don't even...  Hold on.  Where did fucking stupid Forrest Gump...  Wasn't it a river that he was trying to catch shrimp in?  Can't you catch him in a river?  No.  I think he was down in like Louisiana or something.  Oh, the bayou of Louisiana.  Okay.  Maybe like at the mouth of the old Mississippi.  But I don't think in Indianapolis you're getting shrimp. 
[00:24:30]  What are they...  You don't know.  All right.  It's a dumbass bet.  Exactly.  Is that the way you took that?  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, congratulations on your fine victory yesterday.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, boys.  Hey, man.  Yeah, they really took it to him, right?  What about the big fuck you to the Indianapolis Colts fan?  I think you owe us an apology.  I fucking...  I've congratulated all you motherfuckers on Twitter last night.  All you motherfuckers.  That's a good apology.  I was definitely rough leading up to the game, but in the end I said, hey, congratulations.  That was nice to you faggots.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I gotta fucking check that Twitter thing out, I guess.  I even exploited my little fucking nephew from the christening to make a little video about  how the Jets fans felt.  So, look, I did everything I could for you.  Hey, the shrimp cocktail thing is from St. Elmo's.  It's a famous steakhouse.  It's not that they catch the shrimp in Indianapolis, Jimmy.  It's just that they have them flown in daily.  Well, then how about...  Yeah, but that's then steak from a steakhouse because flown in daily is not like where they  get some shrimp and you get it like that day and it's gotta be frozen and flown and... 
[00:25:30]  I think your mayor sucks.  That's a stupid bet.  He does suck, but he's not blind like your governor.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  No one else holding that high an office in this country is blind.  I think Patterson's the only blind governor.  Rules.  And they make the horseradish sauce right there.  They grind it up...  Right, Woody, hold on.  They make the horseradish on-premises?  That's unheard of! 
[00:26:00]  Dude, I knew there was a place in this country that made horseradish on-premises.  You gotta fly it in from Indiana.  And they buy the bread from within three hours of there.  My God.  Freshest food ever.  Impossible.  You still haven't explained...  I'm losing it here.  All right, look.  I gotta get another Colts fan because there's no way that's the explanation.  That they're known for their shrimp cocktail and steak at this St. Elmo Steakhouse, but 
[00:26:30]  it's still flown in shrimp.  You would still...  Yeah, you would still send the steak over the shrimp.  Send the steak.  You know you're gonna be able to get some fucking beef out there.  You don't see shrimp as an entree.  Yeah.  You don't send the appetizer.  You send the entree.  New York, known for good pizza, no matter where you are.  For real, though?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's get into it.  It is.  For real.  That's for real, yo.  A little too thin for me.  I like that.  I like Western New York pizza, believe it or not.  A little thicker.  A little thicker.  That's your upbringing.  It's a little meaty. 
[00:27:00]  I'm not from...  Well, I guess I spent...  You spent formative years there.  I did spend too much time up there.  I probably fucked you up in your pizza palette.  Your pizza palette's fucked.  It's too thin, and then it burns your fucking mouth.  The roof of your mouth.  Tasty.  I want a slice of pizza right now.  Pizza makes my mouth cry.  Sparrow pizza?  You're going with Sparrow pizza as the best New York pizza?  No, it's funny in the office.  It was Michael Scott.  He's talking about going to...  He's excited to go to New York for his favorite New York pizza, and then it's him outside of a Sparrow.  He's in Thomas Square and he's walking around and he goes, let me... 
[00:27:30]  I'm going to go in and get some of that famous New York pizza, and they show him walking to a Sparrow.  Fucking asshole.  They have some nice...  It was still pretty funny.  They have some nice spaghetti, actually.  Sparrow.  Sparrow?  Sparrow?  Sparrow.  It's good when you're really hammered at like three in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah, you shove anything in your mouth.  That's the only thing open.  Exactly.  You shove anything in your mouth.  No one has ever had bad pizza.  Oh, yeah.  You've had bad pizza where you actually go, this sucks.  It's just not like when you...  Again, when you eat it in New York all the time or when you're used to it, it's like then  you have a piece that's like somewhere and it's like too much sauce is too saucy. 
[00:28:00]  You've traveled around, Jimmy.  Worst pizza in America.  Hard to say.  I mean, I haven't eaten much of it in LA.  California, man.  California.  Oh, yeah, because they fuck it up with all that...  No, no.  With all that shit.  The thing is, if they fuck it up, then at least they could call it some kind of California  pizza.  Even Chicago, you know, they got a deep dish pizza.  It doesn't taste like fucking pizza, but it's good because it's just kind of a different thing.  So California wants to throw vegetables on there, but if you try to get a New York-style  pizza in California, it sucks. 
[00:28:30]  The dough is like crusty, like bready chalk.  It stinks.  There's a pizza place called John's in the village that's supposed to be amazing.  Yeah.  Wow, I shouldn't even have thought that much until I said it.  I mean, it's true, but who cares?  I was just trying to come out with a John's joke.  Oh, John's.  Yeah, that's why you would be there.  Nothing computed.  They fucking put the pizza through a little hole in metal.  You have to eat it. 
[00:29:00]  There you go.  John's pizza.  Fucking A, man.  You don't get to eat it.  You just kind of suck on...  It rolls off in there.  Yeah, they squeeze it in your face and the fucking pizza oil drips under your chin.  Then you go home and fucking lie to your wife and kids.  You kiss your kid with dried seeds on your face.  Look where Danny comes.  Oh, Danny, you found that.  That's nice.  The guy's got a pizza, a whole pizza on his lap with a hole cut down the middle and his  lovely lady's blowing him.  Going right down on him there through the pizza. 
[00:29:30]  And he looks like a lighter David Patterson.  She has giant earrings.  Yay.  Well, that's so he can hold on.  Right, guys?  Hey.  People want to know what about the Chicago pizza, that deep dish pizza thing.  I don't mind it.  I like it.  But it's something completely different than pizza.  It's not like you're getting pizza.  You're getting Chicago deep dish.  You're getting a lot of cheese.  Fucking pizza cake.  It's like a pizza cake.  Good stuff.  What is this guy?  Let's go to Barry in Ohio. 
[00:30:00]  Barry.  Yeah, boys.  Talking about football and pizza right now.  Yeah, well, you know.  Indiana's known for fucking corn.  That's it.  That's why they have lame bets with the mayors.  Why not just ship a whole bunch of corn?  Yeah.  Big ears.  Get creative with your dumb corn.  I used to do some of your corn.  Right.  Very well.  Touch it out.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks for ruining our entire fucking morning.  With your stupid bets.  Let's go to Bill in Jersey. 
[00:30:30]  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  You love the show.  Thank you, Bill.  Yeah, you guys missed the quote last night.  Patterson was on the news, and he was saying how when he was watching the Jets game back  when they won the Super Bowl against the Colts, he was sitting in front of the television.  Yeah.  Well, was he always blind, or did he become blind?  Maybe he could see back then.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, was he?  We don't even know about his blindness. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Well, I think he became blind.  I don't remember now.  I don't know.  He looked at Lot's wife or something.  Something biblical happened to him.  He lost his sight.  It was on Christmas, and he fucked a jackal.  It was something creepy.  Yeah, I don't know.  Did he become blind?  Oh, let's see.  Danny's looking at his biography.  Oh, boy.  Long-suffering Jets fans, though.  If they would have won, it would have been the first time they were in the Super Bowl in 41 years.  Mm-hmm.  41 years.  I didn't even... 
[00:31:30]  I guess as a Jets fan, you do realize that, but you don't really think about it.  And then you go, oh, my God, it's been 41 years.  41 years.  Well...  And the Saints haven't even been a team for 41 years, I would imagine, right?  No.  They'll be good next year, though, if they keep the same team.  Jets?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, man.  In the end, the Jets had a great year.  But, I mean, you have these news ladies on TV going, let's keep positive.  They had a really good year. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, my God.  No one's thinking that right now.  Exactly.  So shut up, brood.  Holy shit.  When summer hits, then they'll start thinking about how they had a great year, and now we're  moving forward.  But right now, it just sucks.  What, Ed?  How does that happen?  At the age of three months, Patterson contracted an ear infection, which spread to his optic  nerve, leaving him with no sight in his left eye and severely limited sight in his right.  From an ear infection? 
[00:32:30]  God, that's frightening.  So he could probably see a teeny, teeny bit.  It's like maybe shadows.  Yeah, I don't know.  Can he see the TV at all?  Like a big set?  Could he watch the game at all?  It looks like he was watching something.  The picture on the paper, it looks like he was watching something.  Does he know he's a...  God, that would be terrible.  How bad would it be to go to a Super Bowl party with Governor Patterson, and he sits right  in front of the TV fucking up everyone else's view, and no one is willing to tell him to 
[00:33:00]  fucking move out of the way?  Governor, could you just move it over a little bit?  Tim, Massachusetts.  Hey, boys.  I don't know if anyone brought this up or not, but with the Colts making it to the Super  Bowl, do you think that the whole resting your players thing is going to catch on to the  last couple of games of the season, just going to suck?  Maybe.  I mean, you know, Colts were smart.  Bad question?  Bad answer.  Well, the rest of their guys, they made sure they kept them healthy, so, you know, who 
[00:33:30]  am I?  I said it was a dumb move during the season, but what do I know?  You think the Colts beat the Saints, though?  It's going to be a hell of a game.  Yeah, I think so.  You can't...  God damn that, Manning.  Breeze is fucking solid, dude.  Yeah, I know.  Breeze is fucking solid.  Oh, no.  Let me go to the phones real fast.  Let's go to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Jimmy James.  Hey, wait, please. 
[00:34:00]  Hey, boys, I just wanted to point out how much Indianapolis sucks.  They are shipping...  They get shipped in every day from the nearest ocean port, which is New York.  Oh, really?  Oh, great.  They're sending it from New York to Indy to throw some horseradish in the  box.  And they're shipping it right back.  So, basically, this dumb bet, all they provided was the horseradish. 
[00:34:30]  Fucking Indianapolis.  Hey, you guys got a good fucking football team, but your logic sucks.  Hey, uh...  Just to put horseradish in the box.  Sounds to me like these shrimps are taking a bunch of plane rides for no reason.  Hey, that's why I'm watching the game with Patterson.  You just put him in front of the microwave, and every time he dings, he goes, oh, they must  have scored again.  Okay, I should have stopped at one. 
[00:35:00]  It's all right.  It happens.  It's a fine phone call.  Let's go to Adam in Indiana.  Uh, Indiana.  Oh, my God.  Indiana.  Indiana.  Uh, Indiana.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, you know what?  All it is is like, you know, it's a famous restaurant like Morton's, and, you know, they  have the shrimp does come in from New York, and they're famous for their stupid horseradish.  But, you know, they fucked up, and they sent kettle popcorn when the Bears went to the  Super Bowl to Mayor Daley, and everyone made fun of them, so they didn't want to do the  kettle popcorn again, and fuck the Colts, man. 
[00:35:30]  I can't stand them.  I wanted the Jets to win, so...  All right.  But it was an embarrassment, so that's why they sent the shrimp this year, so...  What is...  Now, what does Minnesota have?  Uh, shit.  A lot of lakes, that's all I know.  I mean, I don't know.  What do they have to bet?  I think they, uh, have to send Prince...  New Orleans, what do you mean?  They have to send Prince down, uh, to New Orleans.  Him and his dumb fight song.  Ugh.  Oh, my God, it was that horrific.  That was really bad.  And then he...  All right, boys, function now. 
[00:36:00]  And this is how stupid Prince is.  So he makes this fight song for the Vikings, right?  Do you know that it was almost impossible to find on the internet, because he wouldn't allow  it on the internet, basically, at first?  Why?  Is he gonna sell it?  I don't know.  That's stupid.  We were lucky to get a copy, but a lot of people couldn't...  Were we?  A lot of people, especially on Friday, couldn't find it.  Yeah.  Because he was shutting down fucking websites and shit.  What an asshole.  It's like, dude, a fight song, if you're gonna make one of those, you want to get it out  to everybody immediately. 
[00:36:30]  A little fidget.  A pain in the ass.  I was listening and watching some of those sports shows, and they're like, we'd love to  play this for you, but it's copywritten, and Prince, and this, and that.  There was all sorts of complications with Prince's fight song.  What a dummy.  This guy wants to add his two cents, because his team won.  Ryan, Indianapolis.  What's up, Ryan?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  First time calling into your show, just wanted to let you guys know, a hell of a game yesterday.  Go Colts. 
[00:37:00]  You know, we're gonna come into Miami and beat those Saints up.  Well, wow.  It's gonna be a...  They are, not we.  I like the we.  There was an article on...  There was an article on the we in the paper.  I think it was Phil Mushnick, who hates everything.  But he went after Mike Francesa.  So that's a weird thing, because both those guys are douchebags.  And Mike Francesa was beating up one of his guys that makes a hell of a lot less money  than Mike, because the guy's like, I think we could do it. 
[00:37:30]  He's a Jets fan.  And Mike's like, we, you're not part of the team, being a papa's ass.  Hold on.  And then Phil Mushnick, the beauty of Phil Mushnick, he goes, oh, really, Mike Francesa?  When Bill Parcells was running the team, you said we a lot, and he had a team fucking jacket  that he wore on the air.  Like he's part of the team.  Like he was part of the team.  And what's so phony about that is that, like, it is just a common thing in language.  You say we.  You don't mean it.  It's like, you're picking on a guy for doing that.  It's like, we, you asshole. 
[00:38:00]  Criticize that is stupid.  Yeah, you're not part of the team.  Why are you saying we, dog?  Shut up.  It was in yesterday's papers if one of the boys down the hall could find it, because it's  great, because he just beats up Mike Francesa, which none of us are going to complain about  in this room.  Of course not.  He's a pompous douche.  He really is.  Mushnick's a twat, too.  Mike knows his sports.  You've got to give it to him.  But he's a pompous asshole.  And I say we a lot, and I think everybody that says we when they're referring to their 
[00:38:30]  team, I think we're fully aware that we have nothing to do with it.  That we're not on the team.  Right.  I say we when I talk Islanders a lot.  Yeah.  Like, I'm going to put on the skates and get out there with the boys.  I don't feel any bruises or anything from yesterday's game on me anywhere.  I think I'm okay.  I understand what I'm saying when I say we, so relax.  But Francesa being a hypocrite about it is classic.  I mean, he actually had a team jacket that Bill Parcells gave him back when Parcells  was running the team.  What a guy.  He would brag about knowing Parcells and the coach. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  Remember all that shit?  Let's go to Pat in Staten Island.  Pat.  Pat.  Good evening.  Same goddamn name.  Same joke.  That's in Staten Island, and it's great pizza, but you can't even take, you have to eat  it in the bar itself, because when you take it home and it sucks.  So just shipping it across the country, it's really going to suck.  It's del Giorno.  Yeah, the food bet just sucks. 
[00:39:30]  It's just, it's so done.  It's hack.  It's been overused.  I mean, Danny, do you know what?  Maybe you can find the first mayor's bet, because the first mayor's bet when they did the food  thing, now it's original.  It's like, oh, that's kind of cool and different, right?  But now, many years later, it's just stupid.  It's just dumb.  Did you get the quote?  Jimmy, here it is.  Mike Francesa scolded one of his minions.  He says, what's with the we pom-poms? 
[00:40:00]  You don't work for the team.  You're not we.  You're a sportscaster.  You can't say we.  We.  Friday, he also mocked the caller for referring to the Jets as we.  Gadzooks.  And then, yeah.  Was it Mushnick?  Yeah.  Mushnick then goes, Gadzooks.  During the Bill Parcells Jets years, 1997 through 1999, Francesa not only referred to the Jets  on the air as we, he wore a Jets team jacket. 
[00:40:30]  What an ass.  Mushnick's a prick.  First of all, Gadzooks.  They're both pricks.  The fact that Mushnick would remember that, he should also just be fucking killed in a  house fire.  He's an asshole.  Well, we should explain for the rest of America.  Phil Mushnick, you know, obviously a sports columnist here in New York.  Yeah.  But the guy fucking hates sports, so we don't even know why he's still writing about it.  I don't, I've never seen, I don't read him regularly, but I read here and there.  I've never seen him talk positively about sports.  He seems to hate everything.  Right.  Like, he's not a, he's not, it doesn't seem to me that he's a happy man. 
[00:41:00]  Well, he wants it to be like the old days.  Meh.  When he was probably on his dad's knee watching the sporting event.  Ugh.  Light.  Let's say hi to Daryl in Louisiana.  Daryl.  Morning, boys.  Morning.  Ant, you get your scar yet?  No, the goddamn, my guy got the email back that said, um, stupid thing is, um, was sold  already.  So I'm still waiting. 
[00:41:30]  I just got back from shot.  It's going to be April and May before you see him.  Uh, anyway, uh, the Saints have a lovely, uh, new fight song.  Have you heard it?  It's Party in the M.I.A.  It's a takeoff of Miley Cyrus.  It's atrocious.  Oh my God.  We got to find it.  Yeah, please.  Nothing.  You love horrible songs.  Nothing worse than the football song to pump up the team.  Oh, and look, some lovely shoehorns go in there.  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, I got to check  it out.  Great.  It is douche chills from the max.  If you go to YouTube and just, uh, do Party in the M.I.A.  I think we found it already. 
[00:42:00]  It's a bunch of stills.  Oh, you rule.  Thank you, Daryl.  We're going to check it out right now.  All right, thanks.  And this is for the Saints, I guess?  It's pretty heavy.  Yeah.  Wow.  Grooving.  Sounds like the fucking beginning of, like, an early 80s sitcom.  It started way back in 66 when they announced that we would have a team.  It was 21 years that we had to wait till we fulfilled our playoff dreams.  Back on the scene and we're headed to the party. 
[00:42:30]  In Miami, gonna grab us a Lombardi.  Superdome gone crazy.  Put your hands up, baby.  We had to wait so many years, but now we earned it.  Feel the pressure feeling nervous.  It's like Buddy D up on the radio.  And the Who Dat song was on.  And the Who Dat song was on.  And the Who Dat song was on.  So I put my hands up, the crowd getting loud.  Saints going all the way.  Precious city say yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Who Dat nation say yeah.  So I put my hands up, the crowd getting loud.  You know we're going all the way.  Yeah, it's a party in the M-I-A.  Throwing the ball like he's a gun with triggers.  And Marty draws a bunch of girls getting played through the game.  And I'm black and gold.  That is horrible.  Really, really, really, really bad.  That's got to be a radio guy.  God damn, come on.  That came from a radio guy. 
[00:43:30]  It has to.  It's abysmal.  Let's say hi to Sean in Albany.  Hey, Eric, you were asking what Minnesota has.  They actually had Minneapolis have what's called a Juicy Lucy.  Which is a burger where the cheese is infused into the middle of it.  Man, don't fuck with pizza or cheese.  No, there's a burger.  Oh, burger?  I don't care.  Burgers, too.  Leave the burger alone.  Dude, they infuse the cheese into the burger.  I don't want to eat infusion.  I don't like it. 
[00:44:00]  Eat infusion.  You're not a fan of infusion?  No.  Of anything?  No.  No.  All right.  By the way, I'm watching that five clip again.  There was a defender that would have cut him off.  I'm pretty sure he would not have gotten 10 yards.  He might have got back to the line, but I don't think he would have gotten 10 yards.  But he's already at the 40.  So if he's tackled at the 40, now you're looking at a 57-yard field goal.  Okay?  All he had to do as he moves forward, he doesn't even have to really get to the 30 to give his team a chance. 
[00:44:30]  35.  35.  35.  That's a 52-yarder.  That's a biggie.  Yeah, he should have.  I've noticed a lot of times these quarterbacks will not run ever.  Like, sometimes you see, look, the sideline's clear.  You can run the angle.  Just make the first down even in some occasions.  And then they just fucking throw it away.  He probably didn't want to get hit anymore.  You brought that up.  Oh, no shit.  They beat the shit out of him.  Someone's got to put a montage together of all of the fucking hits he took, because 
[00:45:00]  ouch.  John in Smithtown.  John.  Dude, that's the same fucking song the Phillies used for the World Series.  Miley Cyrus is the sports anthem fucking song of the decade.  It's ridiculous.  The Phillies used it, too?  Fucking gay.  That's bad.  You know that Miley Cyrus is teaming up with Bret Michaels.  What?  For what?  Because she needs another hit.  Why?  She's doing all right.  She needs another hit, so she's redoing every rose has its thorn. 
[00:45:30]  Yep.  With our pal, Bret Michaels.  Great.  So, in other words, Bret's going to be fucking Miley Cyrus.  That's pretty much.  And giving her the herp.  Oh, giving her whatever he's got.  I don't know what he's got, but it can be good.  But we love the guy.  Let's go to Brian in Carolina.  Brian.  Hey, Hope.  What's up?  Hey, brother.  Listen, Anthony was asking what they have in Minneapolis.  Yeah.  The delicacy is something called lutefisk. 
[00:46:00]  It's a slimy, nasty fish that they think is, like, the greatest thing on earth.  Your true Minnesotans eat lutefisk.  Have Danny look it up.  It's gross.  What does it taste like?  I've heard of this.  It tastes like week-old catfish.  Oh, my God.  Why would anyone eat that?  Just because you find something that's moving doesn't mean you have to eat it.  Yeah.  Correct. 
[00:46:30]  Some of this shit is meant to be left alone.  It's horrendous, huh?  They kind of, like, grill it or sear it.  It is horrible.  It is horrid.  Can we find this fish in New York City?  Somebody has to try this.  Somebody has to.  Look at the picture of the damn thing.  It's nasty.  Yeah.  But if you go out there in Minnesota, they all dig some lutefisk.  Lutefisk.  Yeah.  Horrible.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  All right, brother.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye, boys.  Punching out.  Yeah.  That's why I don't get, like, that bacala.  Like, that Italian fish that's the dried fucking crap.  Would you want fresh fish?  I don't know.  I don't know that fish.  Bacala.  It's called bacala.  Bacala.  Bacala.  I don't know.  Some kind of bacala.  Isn't that close to a dessert?  Yeah, where?  Is that it?  Look at it.  It just looks.  Yeah, see?  Look, it's all dry and nasty.  I fucking love eating fish, but I wouldn't eat that shit. 
[00:47:30]  That's what Italian is always saying.  Hey, why?  She smells like a bacala.  Would you eat that?  No.  No.  I'm annoyed my mother would prepare it.  Shut up.  You don't understand.  A lot of people, they don't know how to prepare the bacala.  My mother, God rest her soul.  She could make a bacala.  And makes you go, I like a man.  Bacala.  All right, let's say hi to Steve the truck.  Oh, sorry. 
[00:48:00]  Steve, what are you hauling today, buddy?  Oh, Jed Hooker.  Steve.  Hello.  Steve, the trucker.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, Steve wants to turn us on to the Colts song, which is on YouTube.  It's called Let's Stomp.  Let's see what the Colts song is all about.  Let's stomp.  As Danny finds out, let's go to John.  John.  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton and Danny and one of the interns is more than. 
[00:48:30]  And what's up?  All right.  Lutefisk is dry codfish.  And how they reconstitute it is they soak it in lye.  Wow.  That's horrendous.  They soak it in lye.  And it's nasty.  It tastes like bleachy.  It's almost clear.  You can almost see through the shit.  Holy shit.  Who the fuck's eating that?  I sort of.  How poor do you have to be to eat the. 
[00:49:00]  What is it called?  The Lutefisk?  Lutefisk.  How poor do you have to be to eat that shit?  I sort on that Andrew Zemern show.  Whatever his name is there.  Get a fucking tuna steak if you want fish.  Disgusting.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, she's going to defend the Lutefisk.  What is it again?  Lutefisk?  Yeah.  Lutefisk.  Ann, you're going to defend the Lutefisk?  Lutefisk.  Yeah, I am.  All right.  Because when it's not pronounced Lutefisk, it's pronounced Lutefisk. 
[00:49:30]  How do you pronounce it again?  Oh, my God.  Lutefisk.  Lutefisk.  Lutefisk.  Lutefisk.  Lutefisk.  So you like Lutefisk?  Yeah.  So that means it's Norwegian or Swedish.  Is it a Swedish delicacy?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, it's Swedish.  It's kind of like the Italian bakalana way.  But the guy said they soak it in lye.  We soak it in either oil, and then garlic, and then they cut into small pieces, or they  make a cream sauce and serve a cream sauce. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, my God.  That sounds horrendous, Ann.  But you can get it at any specialty.  If you go to Whole Foods.  Yeah.  Oh, Ann, I don't care for that.  It's Swedish Jimmy, everyone.  I don't care for Lutefisk.  I like to catch it myself.  Where do you go?  The fjords?  I do.  I don't like the Lutefisk.  You're not a fan of that?  I don't.  And it's put in oil. 
[00:50:30]  Uh-oh.  It's starting to sound like Caribbean Jimmy.  No, it's not.  It's Lutefisk.  Wow.  God damn.  He's holding it together.  Yeah.  He's holding it together.  I love it.  It gets caught in my high cheekbones.  I like cocoa.  Wait a minute.  Coco.  That's good.  Oh, Swiss Jimmy. 
[00:51:00]  Let's say hi to Dan in Nebraska.  Dan.  He's out of his fucking mind.  Dan.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hello, Dan.  I'd like to thank Dan for damn near killing the show before I got on the air and sweet  tips for saving it.  What's that?  What happened?  He's just reviewing all the callers that came before him.  Oh, okay.  Not bad.  What up, Dan?  I just wanted to say, you know, Brett Favre did get his ankle taped up earlier in the  game.  It's a goddamn miracle he was back out on the field. 
[00:51:30]  He is one tough motherfucker.  Oh, you know what?  Maybe he couldn't run because you're right.  He did limp off.  Yeah.  He limped off the field a couple times.  He couldn't.  Maybe he couldn't run.  40 years old.  Yeah, they said his left leg was fucked.  That's the best quarterback ever to be 40 years old playing the NFL.  I mean, he got a respect to it.  That's a hell of a compliment.  He's a great quarterback, Sharpie.  He's not the best ever.  All right.  Enough of that shit, my man.  You got a hold of yourself.  Yeah.  What else is he doing?  He conquered Rome.  Why don't you have some lutefisk?  Yeah.  Have some lutefisk.  Spear it on your balls and try to get someone to lick it off.  Try to get a fucking Tomcat to lick lutefisk off your balls. 
[00:52:00]  And stupid Anne's defending the lutefisk.  I know.  That's because that's why Anne likes it.  She takes two fingers full and she dollops it on her taint and allows the fucking local  Tomcats to fucking...  All right.  We got it.  We got it.  All right.  We're in Jersey, Rob.  What's up, Rob?  How you doing, man?  Hey, we're doing all right, Rob.  You're one of my favorites, but I think you're a bit confused.  Bakalavah is the fish.  Bakalavah is the dessert. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  I knew it was close.  I was trying to remember what the letter was that I was missing in there.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  I would eat the bakalavah, Anne, but not the bakalavah.  Bakalavah, yes.  Bakalavah.  No.  That's like flaky.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's flaky.  Which you don't like.  You like cakey, not flaky.  Sometimes I prefer flaky over cakey as in an apple turnover, which is flaky.  Fuck.  Is there anything better than a goddamn apple turnover?  No!  I'm buying.  Get a round of apple turnovers for everybody.  Oh, they are so good.  I hate flaky. 
[00:53:00]  It looks like my dessert has dandruff.  I fucking despise flaky desserts.  I hate when flecks of dead skin come off my crust.  Oh, look.  It's shedding like a snake.  How delicious.  It's an apple with dandruff.  It's good stuff.  It's not good stuff.  It is good stuff.  Flaky.  Yeah, flaky.  Cooked just right.  Cooked just right.  So it looks like nuclear fallout blowing off the top of your fucking dessert.  Stinks.  Done to a turn.  Yeah, it's delicious if you enjoy eating fucking what got bombed in the 40s. 
[00:53:30]  Besides that joke in the fucking, in the 2010s.  In the 2010s.  They put that joke in a DeLorean.  Oh, fuck.  I couldn't think of Hiroshima.  Yes.  Or you could have gone with Nagasaki.  I know.  I almost said Tokyo.  I'm like, no.  Well, they got bombed.  Kevin from Connecticut has the stat of the day.  Stat of the day?  Did we even ask for it?  Or mindless nonsense.  Nonsense.  Okay. 
[00:54:00]  Favre's last passes for the Vikings, the Jets, and the Packers have all been interceptions.  Beat that one today.  All right.  Fun fact.  That's a pretty good stat.  That's a fun fact.  His first passes were all for seven-yard gains for each team.  Huh?  What happened?  He's flying.  No, I'm not.  His passes.  I'm not even looking at him.  His passes for the Packers, Jets, and the Vikings, first pass he ever threw for each  team was all seven-yard games.  Gains?  Gains.  Seven-yard gains.  Except for the Packers and Jets. 
[00:54:30]  He's such an asshole.  All right.  Let's go to Spanky in North Carolina.  Spanky.  Oh, the Pope is a Saints fan.  Toot-a-ly-doo.  The story is with the name Saints, because they're kind of going to the end of something.  Who the fuck didn't do the Pope bit this weekend?  I forgot about it.  Who the fuck didn't do a toot-a-ly-doo?  How do you forget one of the better bits you've done in recent memory?  What?  That thing was amazing.  I just forgot.  Oh. 
[00:55:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  The Pope likes sudden death over time, toot-a-ly-doo.  How do you forget the bit?  You have the entire audience doing it all weekend, and the guy that came up with it forgot about it.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo. 
[00:55:30]  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  A toot-a-ly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Very good.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Um, Avatar.  Toodly-doo.  Ready to sink the Titanic, by the way.  Toodly-doo.  Two million dollars shy of becoming the highest grossing film ever, ever, ever.  How great would it be if it falls short?  W-T-F.  How great would it be if it just falls short?  Yeah, like eight dollars.  Yeah, like no one goes now. 
[00:56:00]  They just, they're done.  Yeah.  That's pretty amazing.  Pretty fucking fast, too.  Titanic took a little longer than this.  It certainly did.  A little.  I'm exaggerating.  It took a lot longer.  What is it?  I hear the story sucks a dick.  Dude, you gotta-  The 3D is like amazing, but it's like a niche thing.  You gotta go see it.  I understand I gotta see it.  Cause it's-  I'm waiting for a special screening.  I want the 3D version, man.  I, I, but like-  You gotta go see it.  Is it, is it that like fucking amazing that the 3D makes it past Titanic in fucking ticket sales? 
[00:56:30]  Without the 3D.  With a shitty story and shitty-  I'll answer.  I saw the movie.  Without the 3D, the movie doesn't do as well as it's doing.  Well, then it's a gimmick.  It's a gimmick movie.  Well, I don't know if it's a gimmick movie, though, because they really knew how to use the 3D for once.  Well, then anything-  Then take any movie, make it 3D, and it should gross that much?  Well, tell the filmmakers these lazy fucks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well-  Make Crazy Heart 3D. 
[00:57:00]  Make fucking Up in the Air in 3D.  George Lucas wants to take all the Star Wars movies now-  I saw this.  And make them fucking 3D and re-release them.  Why does he just fucking stop it?  This guy cannot stop jacking off over his Star Wars movies.  No, you're Star Wars.  I fucking can't stand him.  We bought every version, but it's time to fucking pack it in.  He wants to put all black actors.  We got it.  Right.  Hey, by the way, they're rebooting-  They call it a reboot, these fucking cocksuckers in Hollywood.  They're rebooting, which means just redoing the same story, Spider-Man and Jurassic Park. 
[00:57:30]  What are you talking about?  They're going to redo Jurassic Park and Spider-Man.  Why Spider-Man?  That's not even that old.  Because they're fucking uncreative jizz buckets.  What are they going to do to Spider-Man?  You mean they're going 3D?  Without Sam Raimi, without Tobey Maguire.  What are you talking about?  With who and what?  And what are they going to do?  Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire both dropped out of Spider-Man 4, so instead of just doing  a sequel, they're referencing this as a reboot.  So all of a sudden, instead of Spider-Man 4, it's just going to be a new Spider-Man franchise  out of nowhere.  That's a start-up.  Yeah.  I get you.  I don't have to start the same fucking story over again. 
[00:58:00]  No one cares.  He gets bitten by a spider, and then web stuff comes out.  And what else?  Jurassic Park.  Yeah.  Jurassic Park, especially for the time, was done very well.  You could watch it now and go, all right, the CGI's gotten better and stuff, but for  the time?  What are they going to do now?  Oh, here comes a Tyrannosaurus in a van.  He's driving.  He's honking.  His tail's coming through the roof.  Just make a new dinosaur movie.  Like, the dinosaurs all become office workers.  Well, they're doing that, too, with the Karate Kid.  You know about that.  Well, they're making him black. 
[00:58:30]  They sure are.  Karate Kid's black.  No.  Yes.  No.  They wouldn't do that.  What's his name's son, right?  Yeah, Will Smith's son.  Will Smith's son.  And your son.  Why not?  Attempting to make a movie.  Why not just make another karate movie?  There is no creativity in Hollywood.  They are just churn out the same few stories over and over.  Yeah.  God.  It's easy.  And now it's take the old stories and put black actors in them.  And that's their idea of being original. 
[00:59:00]  That is original.  God, they stink.  That's the official trailer for the new Karate Kid?  I hope so.  That better be.  If this is Daniel-san, you're fucking up Schitt's Creek, my friend.  They already have a trailer up for the Karate Kid?  It's coming out soon.  June.  Dre, are you ready?  All right.  It's got to be a little urban.  Here we go, yo.  But this wasn't a black movie.  We're on a quest to start a new life.  You're going to China?  Welcome to Beijing.  Why is he going to China? 
[00:59:30]  Look at that, Dre.  Beverly Hills.  We always talk about living there.  Yeah, but I think we're talking about the other one, Mom.  You need to over-explain the joke, really.  You got it.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Nasty Chinese kid.  Big fight with the black kid.  And he's kicking the black kid's ass.  He is home.  Oh, black kids get his ass beat by Chinese kids.  Oh, shit.  Oh, and here comes the new Mr. Miyagi, I guess.  Who is this?  Any way to stop him.  Chinese guy.  Any way to face him.  Okay, so it's the same story. 
[01:00:00]  I will get you.  Uh, it's Jackie Chan?  Jackie Chan?  Yeah, motherfucking Jackie Chan, motherfucker!  Take up your jacket.  Kick it down.  Put it on.  You ready?  Kick it off.  I already did it.  Jacket off.  Oh, here we go.  Wax on, wax off.  Strike!  Pick up your jacket!  Oh, come on.  Instead of wax on, it's pick up your jacket.  Pick up your jacket.  Give me a break. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, shit.  Enough.  And now the evil dojo.  And they're dancing.  What is it?  This blows!  Why am I so upset?  I don't know.  It's just more shit.  I hated the original one.  Ugh.  Wow.  It's good.  I'm Star Wars.  You're Yoda, and I'm like a Jedi.  He killed a fly. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, instead of catching it with the chopsticks,  see, he smacks it with a fly swatter,  and then he picks it up with chopsticks.  In the original, did he catch it with the chopsticks?  Daniel did in Mr. Miyagi's not dressed.  And he was kind of pissed off that he did.  But it was paint the fence, not pick up the jacket.  No, I know.  I remember all that.  I wish Mr. Miyagi was sexually abusive.  Okay.  Squeeze the ass cheeks.  Finger to the backside.  That's how you blind your opponent's eyes.  Wipe a comb off.  And your right hand swoops out. 
[01:01:30]  Bite the pillow.  Show me jiggle the balls.  That's like what you do to the guy.  You just grab his nuts.  It's not even, like, figurative.  Show me.  Keep a secret.  Nice.  Let's go to Bob in Georgia.  Bobby!  Hey, Eric.  What's different about Avatar is that it's not 3D in the traditional sense of stuff comes out at you.  It's that it adds depth to behind the movies.  So it's like you're, it's not where they have somebody drops a pair of keys and then all of a sudden it's rushing to it. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, I didn't know that.  I thought the 3D would, like, a pencil come at you.  Or the ball would shoot it to him and he'd hit you.  Oh, sorry.  Let me go eat more lead paint.  Dang, no!  What are you talking about?  Why are you getting mad?  Because I've been to 3D fucking movies.  Please, you haven't enjoyed this, uh, this, uh, make-believe world of Pandora yet.  Pandora. 
[01:02:30]  With Pandora, 2 million, that, that fucking Hurt Locker was great.  That deserves accolades.  Accolades!  Someone, someone needs credit.  I, I think it might have been Jimmy Fallon said that James Cameron looks like the Quaker Oats guy without the hat.  Are you kind of taking on that look?  Pretty fucking good line about James Cameron.  That's a little mean.  All right, the phones are lit about movies.  We're going to take a break.  Uh, Jimmy saw Up in the Air.  I did!  I want to hear his review of Up in the Air. 
[01:03:00]  Don't say anything until we get back.  I won't.  90% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.  I'm, I'm really looking forward to talking about this movie.  Gary Coleman.  You gotta see his mugshot on TMZ.  We'll talk about Gary Coleman.  Is he still in jail?  Uh, I don't know.  On, like, $1,200 bond?  Let's find out.  If he is, oh, we gotta help him out.  We could get him out of jail, right?  We could get him out in a second.  We'll wire transfer some money over there, and we'll own that motherfucker.  I'm ready to say that Gary Coleman's mugshot could be the best one yet from a celebrity. 
[01:03:30]  Uh, uh, I don't know.  And you remember some of the famous ones.  I'm, I'm talking about, uh, what's his name from 48 Hours, uh, uh, fucking, uh.  Nick Nolte.  Nick Nolte.  Hey, Convict.  A lot of people think Nick Nolte right away, but.  There's your goddamn dinner, Convict.  Wait till you see Gary.  Oh, God.  Wow.  I can say some things right now that would just get me thrown off the air, but is it true?  Look.  Look.  He has, uh, evil eyes. 
[01:04:00]  What's he doing?  He's got evil eyes.  He's turning gray.  He's like a vampire.  Well, fuck it.  His circulation isn't that gray.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  It's still not far to go.  Look at a little ishy.  You know, toes, head, ears, toes, head, ears.  How fucking hard is that?  There's nowhere to travel.  I don't know.  All right.  And other things.  Brangelina might be over.  Oh, no.  Conan's last show. 
[01:04:30]  Got some thoughts on that.  How did Ian, uh, not get that scoop about Angelina?  He's in the paper.  What?  He gave the scoop on our show.  About Angelina and Brad breaking up?  He did say that.  When he came in to promote the book.  Did he?  Were you here when he promoted the book?  I don't listen to him.  He was spot on.  He came in to promote the Brangelina book.  I remember that.  I forgot what his time frame was, but he said something like, within six months, they're done.  Really? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, he nailed it.  I'm stunned.  I mean, if...  How could someone so annoying be so on the mark?  See, Steve, that's probably what you should have in front of us today.  Yes!  If everyone's talking about Brangelina and this guy was on our show saying they're going to break up,  that should be right in front of me.  I was doing a webcam, girl!  I'll get right on that after I get right off this cock.  Ian Halper nailed it.  Yay!  As much as he's a fucking pain in the ass, the guy fucking knows his shit. 
[01:05:30]  Damn.  He had exclusives on Michael Jackson that came true.  Now the Brangelina stuff looks like it's coming true.  He says Tiger Woods.  He heard the audio of the sex tape.  He said, what was the name?  She Lazy Dog?  She kept calling Tiger in the videotape?  Yeah, yeah.  Something Snowball or...  No, not...  He kept saying Snowball or something?  Or something.  Or Snowconing or some shit?  Yeah, I don't know.  No, Ian Halpern's quoted on like page two or three in the paper today.  Really?  Over this Brad and Angelina stuff.  You would think we'd have the clip when he was on our show, but that means...  That means... 
[01:06:00]  That means...  Filling your own fucking blank right there.  Asshole!  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Sphincter!  What's up, everybody?  Monday.  We'll get through this, right?  Oh, is that what we gotta do?  Get through a Monday?  Gary Coleman arrested.  All over the news.  What?  Domestic violence?  Violence.  He was on our show, too, saying how he's happily married. 
[01:06:30]  It's all just bullshit.  Everything you know is bullshit.  Gary was on our show going, yeah, I'm finally in love, man.  She treats me right.  Blah, blah, blah.  Fast forward, what, six months and domestic abuse charges for Gary Coleman,  who a few people are calling the Black Yoda, if you've seen the mugshot.  Hey, we did our sports break, kind of.  I mean, we'll go back to the football games a little bit, but something that was lost in  the mix.  The New York Knicks. 
[01:07:00]  Here in New York City, we got two horrendous basketball teams.  We got the Nets.  What's the Nets record?  Last time, when I was still paying attention, they were like 2-28, I believe.  But the Knicks, not much better.  And yesterday, they lost to the Dallas Mavericks, who sat Jason Kidd, or Jason Kidd's hurt.  One of their star players, obviously.  Yes.  The Knicks lost by 50 points.  Lost by 50.  128-78.  Worst. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  Worst home loss ever, I think, for the franchise.  You could really stop watching the game at some point there, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much.  It's one of those, I really don't have to sit around and watch them foul each other  in the last two minutes.  But they're lucky, because everyone was watching the football, so it's kind of under the radar  that the Knicks lost by 50 yesterday.  Nets are, no way.  The Nets are what?  Someone says, I can't believe that, though.  3-40.  Yeah, that's about right.  That's about right.  Are you kidding me?  That's about right. 
[01:08:00]  3-40.  And then the guy goes, look it up!  Like, he's all mad at me.  Look it up!  3-40.  I bet you, you throw a college basketball team in the NBA for a season, they'll win more  than three games.  Yeah.  Do you realize they've only done three games better than I could do by myself?  Yeah.  There are teams that could just go out there and do better than that.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  No, I think so.  That aren't in the pros.  Hey, we got a big star on the hotline. 
[01:08:30]  What?  He's our pal.  He's our friend.  It's Ian Halperin, everyone.  Ian!  Hey.  Good morning, guys.  How are you doing?  What's up?  Look it up!  Look it up!  Pussy on the internet!  It's everywhere!  Look it up!  Ian!  Man, you do me better than myself.  Yeah.  Somehow I doubt that.  You just put a ribbed.  I was walking in New York last week, and somebody was doing that same imitation.  But obviously not as well as you.  Obviously. 
[01:09:00]  Let me tell you something.  The bottom line to hear...  Wait, wait.  Will you slow down a little bit?  I just want to say, it's easy to do you, Ian.  You just add a little douche to your voice.  Oh, jeez!  That's what Joe Nicolini said, too.  It's easy to do me.  So, Ian.  Ian, you're in the paper today.  Congratulations.  And, you know, it's some of the stuff you said on our show, but no one was paying attention,  I guess.  That this Brangelina...  Yeah, you know, they always make fun of me when I make these predictions, just like Jackson.  And I made this Brangelina prediction on your show. 
[01:09:30]  And here's the deal.  I've had over 1,000 media requests my agent has in the last 24 hours.  And, again, I'm giving this to you guys exclusively.  All right, Ian, we've got to slow you down again.  There's no way you got 1,000 requests.  Jimmy just looked up.  Over 1,000 media requests to my agent in the last 24 hours.  Does that include blogs?  Because, you know, the thing is, I'm a journalist who's known all over Europe.  They always call me all the Europeans, the Americans, and the Canadians.  See, I'm international, guys.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  They've been going nuts.  But here it is.  Google it.  Google it.  1,000 media requests.  Let me say this once again, exclusive to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And here's the deal.  Yes.  What I'm saying is Brad Pitt will follow the script of his good buddy Guy Ritchie during this whole affair.  And he's during his own impending divorce to Madonna when the couple repeatedly denied the story until they made the official announcement. 
[01:10:30]  That's what Pitt is going to follow here.  And here's the way, here's how it's going to play out.  I think that Brangie's going to appear in public probably in the next week, sending the public the message that the rumors are totally false.  But the difference is here, the couple isn't married.  So Angelina can't get herself photographed in public without her ring, as is customary in these Hollywood breakup scenarios.  But as I predicted on your show and in my book, you'll soon start seeing an escalation in these stories, some even in the mainstream press, and some citing unnamed sources that Brad's drinking and pot smoking has gotten way out of control. 
[01:11:00]  And this couple is toast.  I spoke to one of a mutual friend I have with Brad Pitt yesterday.  He said he assured me Pitt's wanted out of the relationship for at least six months.  Wow.  Wow.  Done, huh?  There, too.  Now, there's a rumor that Angelina there was having an affair to the point where some maid, I think, saw Jimmy would appreciate this. 
[01:11:30]  Plastic sheets?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, well, apparently, yeah, she had a guy up in her hotel room.  Look, I wasn't in the bedroom with her, you know, but she came out recently and said they have an open relationship.  That was really the telltale sign that it's all over.  Brad Pitt would never put up with such a charade.  And they're toast.  Whether or not she's had an affair with this guy, I know she's definitely had women up in her bedroom in the last few months. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  There's no doubt about that.  My sources have told me that, who are in the house.  In the house.  So, once again, exclusive to Opie and Anthony, yes, the Pitt-Jolie relationship is over.  They may try to put up some sort of facade, just like Guy Ritchie and Madonna.  When they split, you know, they denied the split.  They appeared in public, and a few weeks later, it all played out.  And, as we know, they were toast. 
[01:12:30]  And that's what we're going to see here.  What about Jennifer Aniston?  For the females listening to our show today, and they're all Team Jen, does she get back together with Brad Pitt?  No, I think Jennifer Aniston needs a good night in the sack with Anthony.  That's what we'll wait for.  There we go.  She has no sex life whatsoever.  Me, you, Betsy.  There's no actuality.  You know, there's something wrong there with Jennifer Aniston.  Well, Ian, you want to...  Well, Ian. 
[01:13:00]  Here he goes.  This is our theory.  No, this is Opie's theory.  This is our theory, and you can run with this, with all the media.  Are you doing we, like we and the Jets, and we and our...  This is my theory, Ian.  Opie.  I think Jennifer Aniston has a smelly pussy.  God damn it.  Well, I can you not.  People have told me that.  And again...  God, listen to this guy!  No, Google it, Google it.  Google it!  I swear...  Smelly pussy, Jennifer Aniston.  You'll see it, you'll see it, you'll see it.  Jennifer Aniston has a smelly pussy. 
[01:13:30]  Smells like...  What was that fish from earlier?  Buckle off.  Buckle off.  Google it!  When I wrote my book, she did not dissuade anyone from cooperating with me in her camp,  and several people did tell me that.  Brad didn't like going down on her.  And you might be kidding, but I think there's a bit of truth there.  The whole cast of friends.  They're the same thing.  Smell.  You know, we haven't seen Jennifer Aniston for some reason since Brad Pitt hooked up  with her in a serious relationship. 
[01:14:00]  It's all been, you know, smoke and mirrors with her.  So you're saying my dumb theory might be right, that Jennifer Aniston has a smelly pussy.  Well, when I wrote the book, several people in her camp came up with the exact same theory.  Unbelievable.  You just said.  What?  People close to her.  Does it smell like a loot fist?  Well, who else has she been with?  What's his name?  Do we know...  John Mayer.  John Mayer.  Why can't we ever talk to John Mayer anymore?  He got too popular.  Yeah, he got too big for us.  It happens. 
[01:14:30]  Can we, like, just ask him one question?  I would love to ask.  Dude, was it or wasn't it?  I would love to ask.  That will settle the whole thing.  I would love to ask that.  Vince Vaughn.  Apparently, Vince Vaughn ran for his life the second he went down on him.  Jesus.  How do you not like Ian?  Come on.  Vince Vaughn.  Google it.  Ian, I got to tell you.  People either love you or hate you as far as you coming on our show.  I was going to say people either hate him or despise him.  No, but...  I'm not running some sort of popularity contest.  I'm just trying to...  Really?  There's some people out there that have been turned, though. 
[01:15:00]  That's what I'm saying.  And all kidding aside, I stand by, you know, this exclusive I gave you this morning.  They're going to play it out exactly like Richie and Madonna.  The Niles are going to, you know, be flying.  But as I said on your show several weeks ago, this couple's toast.  And they're not going to laugh.  Angelina, she's just a lunatic, huh?  Well, you know, she has tried to clean up her image.  I give her that.  And I do believe her humanitarian efforts are sincere. 
[01:15:30]  Whoa, whoa.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Ian, we've got to have a conversation.  Not a monologue here.  If she is a humanitarian, why didn't she show up in that Haiti thing?  That's right down her fucking, right down her hairy box.  Right down her alley there.  In her wheelhouse.  In her wheelhouse, per se.  Well, for say, Angelina's the type of chick sometimes, she's just going to shut her mouth  and just open her womb.  And I think it was one of those days.  You know, she fell out with Brad Pitt, and there was no way they were both appearing on that show. 
[01:16:00]  And Clooney's very tight with Pitt for years.  So he had to have one or the other, and obviously it was Brad Pitt.  That makes perfect sense.  But she would like to, you know, help out Haiti, I'm sure.  I'm sure she would like to adopt half the country to help out.  Yeah, you know, look, that's Angelina Jolie.  She, six kids involved, of course, the relationship.  But Pitt had no idea what he was getting himself into here.  He's never had one child before, and all of a sudden he adopts a whole, you know, a whole tribe. 
[01:16:30]  Brad Pitt has six kids.  What's wrong with him?  He was like this Hollywood stud, and he wakes up, what, five years later, he's got six fucking kids.  Six kids, and people hate, they hate each other now, apparently.  It's a Sonny D commercial in his house.  Unbelievable.  Again, the kids, that's been the big problem.  Because, and I admire them, they've tried to do this secretly behind the scenes 
[01:17:00]  and look out for the best interests and the welfare of the children  instead of running this through a whole public, you know, a whole public charade here.  And they've done that, but there's six kids,  and I hope the welfare of the kids are going to be looked after.  But with Angie Jolie, you never know what's going to happen.  See, one day she's, you know, Mother Teresa, and the next day she's just the devil.  That's how she works, and that's what Pitt couldn't put up with, her temperamental attitude.  It just drove him, his family, his friends over the edge. 
[01:17:30]  And just look at him today.  One picture's worth a million words.  A million?  I want to thank Ian Halpern for calling up and giving us exactly what we could have read in the paper today.  It's just amazing.  But he's credited in it, too, you know.  He's credited for saying those things.  Give us something that's not in the paper.  Do you have anything on Tiger Woods?  Any new info?  More women should be coming out, apparently. 
[01:18:00]  I will say he's had well over 100 women on the side.  Nice.  I mean, that's horrible for Tiger Woods.  We've seen about 12 or 15.  There's dozens more.  Dozens more.  Any hint of him and Jennifer Aniston hooking up?  Ooh.  I don't think so.  That would cure him of the pussy.  That smelly Jennifer Aniston pussy.  You are speculating.  Ian, just back me up.  He's the king of this shit. 
[01:18:30]  Right, Ian?  Hey, look.  You know, sometimes.  But the thing is, my stuff comes true.  I predicted Jackson.  Unfortunately, I predicted Jackson's death to the day.  Well, not to the day.  With the West Coast time conversion.  And this one, on your show, I predicted...  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  I do this because I'm able to get the story that no one else can get.  I get into their camps.  I get into their homes.  Wait, wait.  You know, sometimes I get into them.  Wait, what did Danny find? 
[01:19:00]  Danny found something that's entitled, Jennifer Aniston Might Smell Really, Really Bad.  And it's an article here.  Dude, I'm telling you, we started this rumor.  Come on.  We did it as a goof like a year ago.  People have said that in the past.  Either Jennifer Aniston, Rosario Dawson, or some other chick is a complete and utter stink pot, according to Sex and the City hunk, Jason Lewis.  I guess he went out with the two of them. 
[01:19:30]  He said, when asked whether a woman's physical attributes had ever been a deal breaker for him, Mr. Hotness admitted a past girlfriend sent him running for fresh air.  He says, I was in a particularly malodorous girl, with a particularly malodorous girl once.  Beautiful, but really stinky.  She had every body odor.  I remember thinking, your arms stink.  Your breath stinks.  Oh, God.  Even your hair stinks.  I had no idea what to do. 
[01:20:00]  I remember asking a female friend, what do I do?  Slip her acid fillia?  I don't know.  When I cook for her?  I guess that's some kind of...  That cleans out the pussy.  The pit couldn't go down on her.  It's the bottom line.  He told that to friends.  He just could not even think about it.  The bad breath would kill me, but the vagina smelling a little strong and the armpit odor would be fucking great.  The breath I can't handle.  Wow, that's amazing.  Have you ever had a bad pussy for real?  A real bad...  Not like just a sweaty, they just worked out type. 
[01:20:30]  I'm talking bad pussy.  Yeah, I've had a couple of bad ones, which I don't like.  Cheesy is disgusting.  I doubt she...  I'm sure Norton's had a couple of them.  Oh, dude, you have no idea.  I've had some fucking...  I've had ones that were like dribbling white stuff.  It was awful.  It was like a Greek salad.  Yeah, see?  That's almost...  I'll tell you one thing.  I once had one in Bulgaria, of all places.  I ran for my life.  Google it.  Google it.  Bulgaria.  It's really dirty smelling pussies in Bulgaria. 
[01:21:00]  Ian Halpern, stinky pussy in Bulgaria.  Google it, Google it, Google it.  Jordan from Scranton, PA...  Well, why don't you continue with your radio show there, Ian?  I'd rather give Saddam Hussein a blowjob, I remember saying, than going down on this woman  again.  Did you?  No.  All right.  Jordan from Scranton says, wait, Opie, are you suggesting that Jennifer Aniston's box smells  worse than the Perkins waitress pussy?  Oh, wow.  What do you think's worse, Ian Halpern?  The Perkins waitress that Tiger Woods was allegedly with, or Jennifer Aniston's box? 
[01:21:30]  Well, no, I think Barbara Walters.  You know, I think if I'd have to take Aniston or Walters, I'd still go down on Aniston.  Would you...  Let's slow down a little bit.  Would you eat Barbara Walters' box in?  Jesus Christ, Opie, stop even asking that.  Jimmy, would you?  What's that?  Barbara Walters, would you go down on it?  Nah, not since her last Richard Pryor interview.  I would eat Babs' pussy in 78, which she had Pryor on the couch. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, but 78, that's 30 years.  Yeah, exactly.  I have no desire to eat her box now.  Maybe I'd be a cuckold in liquor cream pie after she fucked the married senator.  Get her fucking out of your mind, man.  How many years ago that was?  She interviewed Castro, right?  I don't know.  Did she?  I don't know.  Yeah, then you got a liquor box.  Jonathan interviewed Castro.  My manager interviewed him.  Nothing but respect for anyone that talked to fucking Castro.  I bet she went down on Castro.  Yeah.  What do you think, Ian?  I think so. 
[01:22:30]  Unclip.  Google it.  I like Norton's manager, by the way.  Yeah, he's great, right?  Your studio.  Yeah, Jonathan rules.  You know, I think if I had my choice, I'd go down on Aniston.  I mean, just getting down on Walters, man.  I mean, I don't know, man.  Hey, Ian, before I let you go, what do you got on Tiger Woods and the sex rehab?  Is it going well?  Is it just a smoke screen?  What's your thoughts?  What are you hearing?  Well, it's his last shot.  He's only doing it to try to get back together with, you know, pass things up with his Swedish bombshell. 
[01:23:00]  And they're going through all the motions, but it's never going to last, that marriage.  You know, again, a sex addict, as Norton could tell you, as Anthony could tell you, it's always two steps forward, one step backward.  And, you know, they're toast.  They were saying on TV over the weekend it takes five years to cure a sex addict.  You can't cure.  There's no cure for it.  Or maybe the, maybe the, maybe the, or get it to a place where it's mad.  Maybe.  Like, people come out, like, all married men, we're just a bunch of horny fucking bastards, 
[01:23:30]  you know?  And the bottom line is, once you, even if you get someone like this chick, this Swedish  chick, she's hot as hell, still, we're never satisfied.  So why even bother getting married?  Like they say that, it is right.  Every man would love to be in one situation.  Every man, man, man.  Having a part of his life.  Two steps forward, you slip on a load.  So what did we learn from Ian Halperin today?  Jennifer Aniston's box might smell. 
[01:24:00]  Probably stinky.  And that there's plastic sheets or something.  Plastic sheets, yeah.  You didn't explain that, Ian.  The paper said plastic sheets.  What is she into if she's got a maid finding plastic sheets?  Is she taking some kind of fat-burning pill at night?  This is Angelina we're talking about.  That was in the paper today, too.  Yeah, look, again, I wasn't in the bedroom, so I'm reserving comment, because my stuff has  to be based on first-hand information.  You know what?  You know, the bottom line here is, I say she's had women coming in and out of her bedroom  the last few months. 
[01:24:30]  I've heard rumors about this guy, but I haven't confirmed them, so I really don't want to comment.  Thank God.  And that's why Ian's so good, because a lot of people want to fucking, you know.  Prove you wrong, but so far, so far they can't, Ian.  I'll tell you, the next few months I'm going to make another major prediction on your show  exclusively to you guys.  I'm working on it right now.  Aw, hell.  After you talk to the insider and everyone else.  By the way, I have something good for you right now.  Oh, no.  If you can do it, I don't know, I could give your producer his number, but you know who 
[01:25:00]  first told me that they're going to split?  Remember that crazy judge in the Anthony Cole Smith case?  We should give him a call.  He'll talk to you right now.  I have his phone number.  Remember Larry Seidland?  Oh, Larry, who Larry, who there was the rumors that him and the lawyer were having homosexual  stuff and then they sued the author?  Yeah, the whole whatever.  Remember the crying judge in the Anthony Cole Smith case?  Yeah, vaguely.  That's such a current story. 
[01:25:30]  I appreciate that.  Yeah, I see him right there.  Bald-headed guy.  Oh, yeah, that guy.  I remember Larry.  Yeah, he'll confirm everything.  He's the first guy who told me, because he was an expert in Florida on family courts,  and he examined them for me for my book and said, based on, they have every symptom of  a couple that's falling apart.  Oh, wow.  You got anything on Watergate?  Watergate.  Jesus.  Really?  Yes.  Jordan wrote from Scranton again. 
[01:26:00]  He goes, LOL.  I wasn't in the bedroom, so I'm reserving comment, but all of my sources tell me Brad wouldn't  chow down on our box.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Yeah, well, that's what Aniston, Aniston's access to her camp, and she made the mistake,  because Opie, I don't know if he knew this or not, I don't know your relationship with  Aniston, Opie, but the bottom line is, Aniston's friends, several of them told me that, that  he just, you know.  I finger-popped her once, Ian.  Really? 
[01:26:30]  I believe you, Opie.  I said you're better looking than Brad Pitt.  I've met both of you now.  All right.  And you definitely have one.  All right, relax.  As far as the...  She's got my ass on.  She's got a nice 40-year-old ass.  She's 40 now, Ant.  That's Jennifer Aniston.  I'm just looking, going like, well, maybe there's some kind of...  A lot of these chicks, you never know.  It was recently revealed that Zita Jones, she says she's 40, she's really 50.  No, really.  No, really.  Constantly in Hollywood.  Go to date of birth.  It's right there. 
[01:27:00]  I lie about my age, but only by two days.  Martin says he's like 35.  He looks about 25.  No, I'm 41.  I'm July 19th.  But I always say July 17th, just to be cheeky.  Oh, there you go.  You're a cancer, Norton.  I certainly am, yes.  Norton.  Very smart people.  Well, we're also homebodies, and we're attached to our mothers.  And we tend to do well with other cancers.  And we tend...  You know, there's a lot of...  I don't really believe in a horror ghost, but I guess I kind of fit the bill.  Hold on, Ian.  You've got fans calling in. 
[01:27:30]  We've got cigars and scotch.  Cigars.  Hey, as much as Ian sounds like a gossipy buffalo bill from Silence of the Lambs, he's really  starting to grow on me.  Yeah, you're turning these people around, Ian.  They hated you at first.  Again, it's not a popularity contest, but look, let me ask you guys all a question.  This is going to be about pussy.  Jolie goes up into your studio right now, butt naked.  Who is not going down on her right now, if you had the choice?  Wait, who?  Anniston?  Anniston?  No, Jolie.  Oh, yeah, that's a no-brainer. 
[01:28:00]  I'd go down on her if she had Magic Johnson's dick in her.  She did once.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Funny you should say that.  My sources are saying.  I'm going to email Anniston and tell her she needs a night with Anthony.  That's it.  That's what might shake her up a bit.  That'll test it out.  I'll see.  I'll put some smell sensors or something around.  What do you got on...  All right, I guess you're done.  When are you going to give us this big exclusive after you talk to everybody else? 
[01:28:30]  I'm still working on it, but I'll make the next prediction on your show.  How about we hint?  No, I can't give a hint because then we'll have 200 other journalists chasing the same story.  Gotcha.  You're a smart man.  All right, sir.  Are you done?  Yeah, I'm done.  Thank you, guys.  You know, Baruch Hashem.  Have a great day.  Did we wake you up?  No, I'm just about to take my daughter to school.  You have a daughter?  You're like a nice father and all that?  Yeah, man.  She can sing. 
[01:29:00]  She's eight years old and she's an amazing singer.  Yeah, she just signed a contract.  Look it up.  And that's my life.  You know, parenting and...  And fucking celebrities' lives.  I'm like just parenting and pussy.  I'm totally different.  I'm just looking for the right woman.  Where are you calling from?  I know I'm not going to tell you.  I'm going to have 300 people show up right outside my door right now.  Really?  It's enough.  I'm so far from you guys.  I'm walking the streets and people are stopping me, telling me they hear me on Opie and Anthony. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  I mean, it's radio for fuck's sake.  I know.  The fuck?  Get us that TV show.  What do you need?  My whole undercover persona is going right out the window with you guys.  It certainly is.  All right, Ian.  All right.  Good talking to you, man.  All right.  Okay.  Peace out.  Take it in.  Peace out.  Google it.  Love you.  Fucking Google it.  That fucking guy.  Dude, I'm going through the Aussie book because we have him tomorrow.  Yeah.  I'm fucking laughing out loud just reading a story about how he had to shit and wipe his 
[01:30:00]  ass with curtains in someone else's house.  Jesus.  Is that cleaning it out?  Dude.  Is Jennifer Aniston in a pool?  Yeah, in a pool.  And she's kind of on the edge of the pool and floating a little bit.  And I don't know.  I can't see how.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Something's up with her because she wants to be married and have a kid and she just can't  find a.  Every guy.  What is up with her?  Tosses her to the wayside.  Every guy seems to.  All right.  We'll do a quick break. 
[01:30:30]  Get into some other things.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  So you guys see Conan's last show?  Nine.  Missed it.  Yeah.  I can't see you right last.  What?  It was pretty good.  I am.  Yeah, man.  I mean, a lot of people are writing about Conan saying the real Conan came out in the last  couple of weeks.  He did a seven share to Letterman's 2.5. 
[01:31:00]  Seven share to, yeah, like a 2.5.  I think, yeah, a little, whatever, yeah.  So you say you got to do your last show every night.  No, you can't.  It wouldn't be the last show.  Unless there's like five different networks a week.  One last show, one first show.  Is the seven share good?  That's a lot of people.  Oh, my God.  How many million is that?  No, I know it's a good one.  It might be seven million.  A million bazillion, I think.  But, yeah, Conan the last couple of weeks seemed to relax.  And a lot of people saying, well, that's the Conan we know and love. 
[01:31:30]  The highlights from the last show, Neil Young came out and did Long May You Run.  Yeah.  Which was really good because I'm a big Neil Young fan.  But I got to tell you, Neil Young starting to look old.  Ironic.  Starting to look old.  Yeah.  Neil old.  Did Conan have anything memorable to say in his, how did he, what was his final sign off  in the monologue?  Well, we do have, we have his final address.  And then he brought Will Farrell out.  Farrell?  Farrell.  Farrell, yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Farrell.  Farrell.  And then they did Freebird.  I am?  With Conan fucking playing the guitar because a lot of people wonder if that was Conan.  Conan fucking could play a guitar.  God damn.  Did he play some slide or was he?  He was, he was.  Oh, Dan?  Yeah, he was playing.  I mean, he was gone.  You know, he was switching back and forth between rhythm and lead.  But he wasn't doing the slide.  Yeah.  And someone else.  They gave him a lead near the end.  But in general, he was doing most of the rhythm.  There's a lot of people jamming out.  Yeah.  I didn't recognize all the people, but it was, you had Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top. 
[01:32:30]  I saw him.  Oh, shit.  I saw Beck.  Yeah.  Beck was part of the band.  Max Weinberg, of course.  And then you had Ben Harper.  Oh, that was Ben Harper.  Fuck, I knew I knew that guy.  Damn.  And Will Ferrell was on lead vocals.  He had a wig on looking kind of like he's, you know, part of like a Southern Rock band.  Of course.  A little scared type thing.  And he had his chick out there that was like nine months pregnant and he's making out with her.  And she's like a hippie broad.  And then they did Freebird straight up.  Wow. 
[01:33:00]  Did it sound good?  It sounded pretty damn good.  And then by the end of it, Will picked up the cowbell and went a little nuts on the cowbell.  But still keeping it real.  People laughing when he got the cowbell?  Yeah.  But I don't think they were going for a laugh at the whole thing.  They were just jamming and having a good time.  And that's how they ended the Conan O'Brien late night experiment.  And it's already in the paper that most likely he's going to be at Fox.  Yeah.  And that's why when he was talking on Friday, you know, they're like, Conan took the high road. 
[01:33:30]  Conan, nothing but class on his way out.  You have class and you take the high road leaving a job when you know you have another job.  Yeah, job to go to.  What are you going to be mad at?  I mean, because if you have nothing, trust me, it's a little different.  I mean, we're all just human in the end, right?  You're going to be a motherfucker as best you can if you have nothing to go to.  But he knows he's going to be okay.  Plus, he's walking away with anywhere from, what, 32 to 35 mil for himself? 
[01:34:00]  Not bad.  And then a few million for his staff thrown in there for good measures?  Not a bad payday.  So this is Conan's final address to the audience.  You guys did not hear this.  So why don't we play this for you guys?  Ladies and gentlemen, before we bring this rodeo to a close, I think a couple of things should be said.  There's been a lot of speculation in the press about what I legally can and can't say about NBC.  And this isn't a joke. 
[01:34:30]  To set the record straight, and this is true, tonight I'm allowed to say anything I want.  And, no, it's not a joke, but thanks, sir.  Tonight I really am allowed to say whatever I want.  And what I want to say is this.  Between my time at Saturday Night Live, the late night show, and my brief run here on the Tonight Show, I've worked with NBC for over 20 years.  Yes, we have our differences right now.  Yes, we're going our separate ways.  But this company has been my home for most of my adult life. 
[01:35:00]  I am enormously proud of the work we've done together.  And I want to thank NBC for making it all possible.  I really do.  A lot of people have been asking me about my state of mind.  And I'll be honest with you, walking away from the Tonight Show is the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  So, making this choice has been enormously difficult. 
[01:35:30]  This is the best job in the world.  I absolutely love doing it.  And I have the best staff and crew in the history of the medium.  I will fight anybody who says I don't.  But no one would.  But despite this sense of loss, I really feel this should be a happy moment.  Every comedian, every comedian dreams of hosting the Tonight Show.  And for seven months, I got to do it.  And I did it my way, with people I love. 
[01:36:00]  I do not regret one second of anything that we've done here.  And, yeah.  And...  You just couldn't have cut your mouth.  I help, you know, I encounter people when I walk on the street now, or just, uh, who give me a sort of a sad look.  I have had more good fortune than anybody I know.  And if our next gig is doing a show in a 7-Eleven parking lot, we will find a way to make it fun. 
[01:36:30]  We really will.  I have no problems.  I don't want to do it in a 7-Eleven parking lot.  But, whatever.  Finally, I have something to say to our fans.  Boring.  This massive outpouring of support and passion from so many people has been overwhelming.  Stop whining.  The rallies, the signs, all this goofy, outrageous creativity on the internet. 
[01:37:00]  Uh, the fact that people have traveled long distances and camped out all night in the pouring rain.  It's pouring.  It's been pouring for days.  And they're camping out to be in our audience.  Really.  You...  Now.  Here's what all of you have done.  You made a sad situation joyous and inspirational. 
[01:37:30]  So, to all the people watching, I can never, ever thank you enough for the kindness to me.  I'll think about it for the rest of my life.  And all I ask is one thing, and this is...  I'm asking this particularly of young people that watch.  Please do not be cynical.  I hate cynicism.  For the record, it's my least favorite quality.  It doesn't lead anywhere.  Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get.  But if you work really hard, and you're kind, amazing things will happen. 
[01:38:00]  I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.  I'm telling you.  It's just true.  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  Good evening.  That was great, though.  That was a great sign-off, man.  It was a good sign-off.  Really, really good.  He knew he was going to be okay, and he's going somewhere else.  Makes it a little easier, I think.  Yeah.  Kind of.  You can't not like the guy after that.  Oh, no.  There's no way to not like him. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  That fucking go home and get your fucking...  I wasn't expecting that.  That clip is always funny.  I know.  I don't know what it is about that one.  It's never not funny.  And then Will Ferrell came out.  You want to hear a taste of Free Burnett?  All right.  You know, we'll do a movie review together.  And then we're doing the up in...  Yes.  Up in air.  Up in the air.  Yes.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's make something amazing happen right now.  Now, here to close out our show are a few good friends led by Mr. Will Ferrell. 
[01:39:00]  Conan.  Conan, I just want to thank you for having me and my lady Dawn on tonight.  And if you're wondering, yes, she is with child.  I want you to strap on your axe and get over here.  Let's lay this sucker down.  What do you say?  Do it! 
[01:39:30]  Let's lay this sucker down.  One, two, three.  And is Free Burnett an easy song to sing?  Yeah, it's not that difficult.  I mean, if you can stay on key, you know.  Because Will did a pretty good job.  It's not a high song.  If I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me? 
[01:40:00]  It's not a high song. 
[01:40:30]  Things just couldn't be the same.  Because I'm as free as a bird now.  And this bird you cannot change.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:41:00]  And this bird you cannot change.  Just walk away.  But I am this bird you cannot change.  Lord, no, I can't change.  What do you think, Ant?  Yeah, he's trying to twang it up a little and make kind of a bit of it. 
[01:41:30]  But it's good.  But it's good.  There's a cone in there playing guitar.  That's kind of cool.  Beck dressed like a hillbilly.  He looks like hillbilly.  He looks like hillbilly.  Though this feeling I can't change.  Well please don't take 
[01:42:00]  Maxwell Albert looks like Leno  Cause the Lord knows  I'm super blind  But if I stay  With you girl  Times just couldn't  Make the sight  Cause I'm as free 
[01:42:30]  As a bird  How about you?  But I am this bird  You cannot try  Oh  I am this bird  You cannot try  That's easy to talk  That's old, motherfucker  Lord, Lord  I can't change 
[01:43:00]  Lord, help me  I can't change  Hey, this is 200 songs  For Max Weinberg to play  I can't change  Yeah  I can't change  I can't change  I can't change  I can't change  I can't change  Yeah  Yeah, he's just kind of 
[01:43:30]  He's giving it his all, right?  He gets to hear it  calling on the lead guitar now  What's that guy's name  From ZZ Top?  That Billy Gibbons?  His beard is going bald  His beard is going bald  He's got a long beard  Oh, shit 
[01:44:00]  Look at Conan go  Wow  That's Conan  He's got a long beard  Hold on 
[01:44:30]  That's a good way to wrap it up.  Yeah.  Different. 
[01:45:00]  That's a good one. 
[01:45:30]  That's a good one. 
[01:46:00]  It's not bad, right?  Nah, it was a great way to end it.  It makes you want to hear the original.  Yeah, well, I don't fucking want it.  You forget how goddamn good that Freebird song is, huh?  That was a good ending.  That was a good way to go out.  Yeah.  Very original.  Plus, he'll have the show back on and listen to you. 
[01:46:30]  Within seven months, he'll be most likely at Fox doing his thing.  Fox.  Good for him.  Good for him, I say.  What are you going to do?  Fucking guys battling it out.  It's up in the air.  It's late night talk shows.  Stop.  Jimmy, nice segue.  Oh, I'm just saying.  I heard your segue.  I didn't mean to.  Up in the air, yes.  Jimmy tweeted that he saw Up in the Air and hated it.  Now, I could tell just from the trailer that this movie was a piece of shit. 
[01:47:00]  You said the same thing about Avatar.  No, no, no.  I didn't say it about Avatar.  I never said that.  I said, I don't think Avatar deserves to be in the position it's in, even though I haven't seen it.  Okay.  But, up in the air, it's like watching any other movie trailer that I could look at and go,  I will never see this movie because it just looks like a bucket of romantic comedy shit.  It's a fucking chick flick.  Yay!  See, I could tell.  I didn't know it was a comedy until there's a scene where George Clooney falls in the lake. 
[01:47:30]  It's a fucking hunk of shit.  And I tweeted that it was, I couldn't believe it got 90% whether there's Oscar considerations for this film.  The reviews are ridiculous on this movie.  Yeah, Clooney's winning awards.  It stunk!  I saw Up in the Air about a month ago and I talked about it on the show and people were beating me up.  I'm like, whoa, what the fuck?  Am I missing out on something?  And now Jimmy's with me, thank God.  He's a motivational speaker.  No, he's not a motivator.  He does that on the side.  I know, I'm trying to say it. 
[01:48:00]  It's like his side is a, he has the fucking, it's some backpack speak.  Empty your back.  It's a meaningless, pointless fucking side story.  You didn't like his take on the motivational speech.  It was garbage.  It's an anticlimactic movie.  He basically talks about a backpack and like, you know, you got too much in your backpack.  So you got to lighten the load in your backpack.  It's like, shut up.  Who fucking can we get it?  You're the eligible Arabic looking bachelor.  You're in hotels a lot.  Fuck you and your fucking frequent flyer status.  The whole movie was a commercial for American Airlines and how great the Admirals Club is and how great Hilton Hotel. 
[01:48:30]  It was in.  Really?  The product placement in this movie.  It was one big fucking commercial.  For you idiots that thought this was a work of art.  See, Admiral Club and Hilton just in the trailer.  The fucking embarrassing product placement in this, in this movie.  And that fucking girl who played the chick that he fucked in a hotel.  They have like this really horrible flirty scene where they're sitting there.  And you know, she's like a guy.  She even walks like a guy to prove that she's a business gal.  And they're sitting there with their cards.  And they're comparing cards in the hotel. 
[01:49:00]  Ah, you have an American Express Black.  Ah, you have the Hilton Honor card.  Yeah, but I only go with this.  And it was fucking awful.  They were bragging by how many cards they got.  Yeah.  Which person had the better cards and stuff.  A little flirty scene.  From all their traveling around the United States of America.  But George Clooney's life is very empty.  He lives his life on the road, Anthony.  When he goes home, he goes home to an empty apartment.  And boy, if that doesn't tell you a lot about his character.  Yes, and what's the problem there?  He has no furniture in his apartment when he does, you know, go home every once in a while. 
[01:49:30]  He plays a guy who goes around and fires people for a living.  He's one of these people that the company will hire him when they don't have the balls to fire somebody.  And he's a motivational speaker on the side.  So his job is to go there and fire them.  And the basic push of the story is he's always on the road.  And his company wants to cut down on his travel.  Because he wants to become one of the 10 million mile people on American Airlines.  And where you get like a lifetime executive club status or whatever the fuck it is.  And it's been a while.  How many people got that status?  Seven, including him.  Because he gets it at the end of the movie. 
[01:50:00]  So I hope I blew it for you.  Who gives a shit?  And you get to fucking...  Here's your big prize.  You get to meet this fucking cheese dick in a mustache who works for American Airlines.  That's what's his name?  Who?  I always forget his name.  He was the fucking father in Mask.  Oh, Sam Elliott.  Exactly.  Sam Elliott.  Oh, Sam Elliott.  Yeah, with a big fucking mustache.  He's so stupid.  It's everything you thought it would be.  Beef.  It's what's for dinner.  Everything y'all thought it would be.  It was one attempt at a moment after another. 
[01:50:30]  I didn't give a shit about...  Then there was the wedding scene.  It was a whole bunch of rotten, boring stories thrown into one long, rotten, boring story.  And I didn't...  Even the firing montage about the people that were firing.  They were interesting, you know, to see the people getting fired.  This is fucking fruity Hollywood trying to show the working class and the fired people  in America how in touch with you they really are.  How you're not being overlooked.  God bless you, Jimmy.  It was shit.  Because I was like, what is the big deal about this dumb movie? 
[01:51:00]  And the girl who played the side...  The new young girl with the overacting, awkward girl with Eddie Munster hair.  And she was like, you know, oh, you know, a relationship is supposed to be...  Her acting was terrible.  She might be good in Twilight.  She was awful in this.  She's ugly, too.  That's not...  I guess she was supposed to be a plain Jane type.  But it was the forced, awkward girl.  The overacting, awkward girl.  It was just awful.  And people that were trashing me on Twitter for smashing this movie...  They were trashing you?  A bunch of these fucking man pussies thought it was great. 
[01:51:30]  But feel free to call in and defend it if you want.  Wow.  It stunk.  Let's say hi to Jason in Virginia.  Jason.  Hey, boys.  Hi, Jason.  I'm pretty sure this movie was done in the 80s and it was done right.  It was the first time playing strange in automobiles.  What?  That sounds just like Del Griffith.  Well, it was a comedy.  I mean, that was actually a real comedy.  This was exactly what critics like.  It was a soft, non-threatening, romantic comedy that didn't offend any of their sacred cows or sensibilities. 
[01:52:00]  That's why critics love this hunk of shit.  Terrible movie.  Up in the air.  Yeah, it wasn't good.  Danny McBride was fun.  I will not see it.  Even Danny McBride couldn't do it.  There was no reason for him to be in that movie.  He plays a fucking groom.  Well, yeah, because like his...  I don't know.  George Clooney goes home for his niece's wedding or something.  His sister.  Sister's...  What's the movie?  Sister's kid's wedding.  What's the movie poster?  No, his sister's wedding.  What's the movie poster look like?  Sister's wedding.  You sure?  Yeah, it was his younger sister.  Okay.  And I didn't give a shit about the wedding or the conflict that Clooney helps them out 
[01:52:30]  of and the fucking dumb older sisters of the thing and she goes dramatically, welcome  home.  Oh, shut up, bitch.  The guy goes home for maybe 10 days a year.  His life is on the road.  You don't like it.  It was...  Dude, it was enraging.  And I'll say this for my girlfriend.  She fucking didn't want to watch it and she despised it before I did, which was one  minute into it.  Wow.  We hated this movie and the music was terrible.  And you got all the way to the end even though you hated it?  Well, I think if I'm going to bash it, I should see the whole thing.  Wow, fucking hell. 
[01:53:00]  So, the music in it was unlistenable.  I don't know if you can...  What was the music in it?  I don't remember any of the songs now.  Exactly.  I'm trying to think.  It stunk.  And the montage of him looking down at individual cities.  Dude, it was so embarrassing that...  Oh, they did that?  Oh, yeah.  This was a commercial, a product placement commercial for Hilton and American Airlines.  And there's one line where they're talking about the cards going back and forth.  I said, she said something about, oh, you always fly the same.  And he goes, well, there's no weakness in loyalty or whatever. 
[01:53:30]  He gave like some company line.  It's like, oh, come on, man.  Shut up.  Did you see the twist coming?  Yes.  From about five minutes into the movie, I said it to my girlfriend.  Really?  Absolutely.  I saw it coming.  Yes.  They telegraphed that from 300 miles away.  Oh, no.  A heartbreak is coming.  Yuck.  I heard.  Yeah.  No, I'm just trying to protect for the listeners because we spoil way too many movies.  I fucking blew it in my say now message, the ending.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  Let's see how to Johnny Death.  Johnny Death.  Hey, you know, there's not much left to say because Jimmy just covered everything.  I saw it with three friends and three chicks, and the chicks hated it even worse than we did.  It's a chick flick.  No, but the women hated it as well, which is kind of refreshing, man.  Because you'd think the women would just eat up that crap.  And they didn't.  And for a movie called Up in the Air, I felt, oh, God, this was bad, down in the fucking dumps afterwards.  By the end of the movie, I was thinking to myself, what was the point of this movie? 
[01:54:30]  Like, I don't really understand.  Was there a hidden message?  What were they trying to accomplish that is getting 90% plus reviews on Rotten Tomatoes?  I'm sorry, but I think that pissed me off more than anything else.  What?  Why is this film in the top five, in the top 10% on every fucking list?  But then you get mad.  You're like, what?  I guess I just don't get it, man.  Man.  The guy had no life and never is going to.  But it didn't matter. 
[01:55:00]  Fuck him.  And all those people that they were firing, I just, this movie should have been more about them.  I just didn't feel anything for them.  I didn't feel anything for his plight.  I didn't feel anything for the new corporate awkward girl, the phony, awkward girl that Hollywood loves.  They love the hot, I'm way too hot to be awkward, but I'm phonily pretending to be awkward.  They love the fucking phony nerd image in this shitty town.  How about getting a real ugly girl to play that part?  Get a real fucking nerd. 
[01:55:30]  It was like shallow hell.  They couldn't make a statement about beauty unless they had fucking stupid Gwyneth Paltrow make it.  Get me a fucking fat pig to make the statement, you shallow cunts.  They went as ugly as they could.  You know what I mean?  They went pretty close.  You can't go too ugly in Hollywood.  Nah, nah.  So I feel sorry for the actresses where they go, you're just ugly enough.  You want like precious in there.  Yeah.  Well, let Steve Buscemi make a statement about beauty.  A lot of chicks love Steve Buscemi. 
[01:56:00]  You like Jason Bateman as the corporate douche boss?  It was alright.  I mean, and Galifianakis had like one scene.  They were fine.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, he was a non-factor really.  I mean, his scene was funny.  He was one of the guys that got fired.  He was okay.  He did a good job with it.  Huh?  Before I punch out, I'd just like to say all they needed to do was fire the audience during  the first five minutes of that movie.  I just thought, dude, I didn't know it was a comedy.  It was everything I hate in a movie.  It was like attempting to have a message and attempting to have a bunch of, a bunch of 
[01:56:30]  messages.  I despise light-hearted rumps.  I loathe them.  And just, what about the montage where Clooney's falling for her?  Taking her back to his high school and showing.  Oh, where they break into the high school and walk around and you're supposed to feel  something?  Oh, yeah.  No.  And you're supposed to feel something for this guy?  Like, wow.  He's finally getting in touch with values.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck him and his school.  And fuck that masculine broad he was hitting on.  He finally found someone to trust.  He's going to take her to his old high school.  Exactly. 
[01:57:00]  And they're making out where he made out with girls 30 years earlier.  Exactly.  And then they're watching basketball practice and nobody notices why the two 50-year-olds  are watching a bunch of high school students practice.  Right.  She's probably whispering in his ear how she's going to fuck the black center.  He's a cuckold.  It was a terrible movie, man.  I hate it.  It didn't move me at all.  There was one anti-climax after another.  It was trying so hard to have moments and it failed on every front.  I agree.  Wow.  That's fucking great. 
[01:57:30]  What's that?  Best review of the year, little Jimmy.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm with Jimmy on this one.  Big time.  Horrendous movie.  Big time on it with Jimmy.  Dude, it made me angry.  I love movie critic Jimmy.  I would love to do that for a living.  But you know what?  That was very accurate.  That's very accurate with a few funny lines in there.  But it was, you didn't, there was no point to the movie.  Once they did the Hollywood flirt with a couple flirts and then after they fucked the next  morning, Clooney and her, where are you going to be?  And they both, they're like, they're both sitting across from each other at a desk and 
[01:58:00]  they both open their exact same size laptops and the backs of the laptops meet and then  Des Moines, not busy that way.  Oh, the two busy people connecting.  No one interacts like that.  You're missing one detail, Jimmy.  What?  She's wearing his shirt in the morning.  Oh, I didn't catch that.  Oh, God.  That old dad.  It's not surprising.  She was fucking masculine.  Hey, wow.  There's a chick that travels.  Just like the boys.  Hey, I got my Amex black card.  Hey, I got my Hilton honors card.  And they continually show him walking to the first class line and zipping ahead of everyone. 
[01:58:30]  And they continually show him checking into the Hilton's honors thing, zipping ahead of  everyone.  And there's one scene, you fucking, you product whore fucking movie, where there's a people  on line at the Hilton and he zips ahead of them and the girl goes, hey, what about us?  And he goes, well, I'm an honors member.  I check in first.  That's a commercial.  All that was George Clooney for Hilton's honor.  It was a way to get money from fuck, I guarantee you, they got money from Hilton and American 
[01:59:00]  Airlines.  Well, that's what they do now.  But I don't mind some product placement.  That's not an emplacement.  That is an endorsement.  It was worse than fucking that Hanks movie with FedEx.  That embarrassing commercial.  Oh, fuck.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  I went at the same studio, did those?  It was not bad, though, because their plane crashed.  But it was about FedEx and about, you know, just about how great it was.  Watch the beginning of that Hanks movie.  What's that Hanks movie?  Castaway.  Castaway.  All the things that are said about MX that are positive.  Watch the beginning of that fucking movie.  You're going to want to vomit when you're looking for it.  Your plane crashed. 
[01:59:30]  And one last thing.  Everyone was like, what about her ass?  Oh, look at her ass.  Because there was a scene where...  Oh, that was good if it was hers.  It wasn't.  It was a stunt ass.  It came out in the press.  Yeah?  And her ass doesn't look like that.  Aniston's?  They had to bring in a stunt ass.  Aniston was not...  Who was it?  Aniston's ass did they show?  Was that it?  Just smell-o-vision?  Scratch and sniff the screen.  Victor, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, look.  I get and understand your show, but Jimmy is an aspiring actor.  And I would think with Hollywood being a kiss-ass place that it is, I would not be trashing the director. 
[02:00:00]  Even though I know the movie sucked.  I mean, I didn't even see it.  But listening to Jimmy, you know, I don't even want to see it.  I don't know who the director is.  Well, he probably knows who you are now, though.  Who cares?  No, they don't care, dude.  Jimmy's not going to sell out.  No!  My acting is fucking mediocre or awful to begin with.  What am I going to do?  Be in a movie with Clooney?  He is a good actor.  Did he do a nice job in this?  Yes!  He was good.  But who gives a shit?  There was a boring movie, and I'm not a fucking great actor. 
[02:00:30]  I'm a comic.  Let's go to Andy in Cleveland.  Andy?  Yeah, actually, I had a double torture seeing this movie because I had to sit through the  preview of Sex and the City 2.  Oh, fuck no.  Is that out?  Not yet.  It always hit me in the arm because I said it very loudly.  Now I know why the popcorn comes in bags and proceeded to vomit, fake vomit, in the popcorn.  You've got to go on that, my friend.  Find the trailer, dude.  Find the new Sex and the City 2 trailer.  We've got to hit that one up if we're talking movies. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, I wonder what it's about.  Oh, here it is.  Speaking of up in the air.  Come on, let's get some volume.  All right.  Hold on one second, though, David.  What do you want to say, Andy, before we let you go?  The only fascinating thing about the movie, the only good thing, was watching the firing  scenes because on the actual movie channel, they had an interview with the director, and  he said they actually interviewed people who had been fired in this town where they shot  most of the movie, and if you watch some of them, they're so nervous just talking about 
[02:01:30]  the situation of being fired.  The one woman actually broke into hives and stopped breathing in her interview, and you  can see her in the film, and her neck just is totally like a fucking strawberry patch.  It just goes up, and she can't even get through the concept of having to act out.  Were those real people that had been fired?  That's what he's saying.  No, they weren't acting?  Okay, that's cool.  Yeah, but good.  One good minute.  If they had balls, they would have fired people for the movie.  Thank you, Andy.  We're going to check out the Sex and the City trailer, then get back to your phone calls 
[02:02:00]  because now everybody is fired up about Up in the Air, a movie that George Clooney  might win an Oscar for.  He's never going to win it, by the way.  Here we go.  Where's the music?  Come on, right?  Starts with the music?  It's boofering.  Come on, come on.  This summer, get ready to carry on.  The way it's spelled.  Oh, no. 
[02:02:30]  The opening shot of her coming out of a fucking building.  A stall.  Yeah.  She walks out of a building and somebody has to ride her through Central Park for 50 bucks.  And you thought you'd never seen it in a million years.  And just when you think you've seen it all, it hits you.  You haven't seen anything yet.  The friendship, the fun, the fashion. 
[02:03:00]  Get carried away.  Get it.  What a dog.  Far away.  Oh, they're in Egypt.  They're...  Oh, stop it.  Just stop this.  Sex in the city, too.  Sometimes you just have to get away with the girls.  I hope Al-Qaeda gets them and cuts their heads off. 
[02:03:30]  Now, Anthony.  Yay.  Yeah, they're walking through Egypt.  I hope they...  I hope in the opening scene, they walk into a pyramid and a rock falls and they suffocate.  And then the entire rest of the movie is the Egyptian government trying to figure out how these trespassers got in their land.  It's a whole movie about some fucking legal battle.  Yes, again, it has nothing to do with them.  The first minute of the movie, they get horribly killed.  Yeah.  And then they fucking...  They die of suffocation. 
[02:04:00]  And at the end of the movie, there's like a big court scene going on.  And they're dragging four bodies with white covers on them out of the fucking crypt.  And they wind up finding another king's tomb thanks to them.  Those nosy whores.  Well, they actually think that she's a mummy.  A king.  A horse of pheresis.  The whole movie, the Egyptians are trying to ride.  Sarah Jessica Parker is thinking she's a camel.  She has to keep convincing them, I'm not a camel.  I'm not a camel. 
[02:04:30]  I'm not a camel.  I fucked a camel one.  Speaking of camel cock.  On film.  We weren't talking about camel cock, you fucking idiot.  And she finally convinced them she's not a camel.  And then she accidentally spits on their windshield.  Speaking of spitting.  Alright, we get it.  You're a slut.  Who the fuck?  And that movie will do just great.  Yeah.  Because dumb bitches will fucking go see it.  Yuck.  Let me see.  Okay.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see. 
[02:05:00]  Okay, let's go to Matt and Houston.  Matt and Houston.  Hey guys.  My chick and I saw this movie and we're like, wow.  The woman who plays the lead is pretty attractive for an older broad.  Turns out she was born in 1973.  What?  She was like 34, 35 when that movie was built.  No way.  Are you serious?  George Clooney's love interest through the whole movie.  She does look like she's pushing 50.  And this guy's trying to tell me that she's actually 35, 36 in real life. 
[02:05:30]  I really felt bad for a poor guy like Clooney.  Flying first class all over the country and getting pussy.  Wow, that's terrible.  Poor good looking Clooney with his big eyebrows.  Enough with him.  Looks like the fucking king of Egypt.  Fucking creep.  Enough with him.  God almighty.  How are you supposed to feel bad for that guy?  Ah, he's finally going to find love with his 10 million first class miles.  Shut up, cunt.  Let's go to Uncle Luke.  Show me a guy that looks like the father from Mork and Mindy. 
[02:06:00]  Flying coach.  Show me Conrad Janis trying to get fucking pussy in Oklahoma somewhere.  And then he got a story.  Yeah.  Uncle Luke.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, you know, it took a while to get going, but I did get into it.  I kind of liked it.  But, like, they fucked up the ending so bad.  Like, it ended, like, three times.  And it had a perfect time to end it.  And I was like, please end.  And it didn't.  It just kept going.  I was like, fuck, man.  It was so close.  I don't know.  Well, Hollywood just, they just wimp out with these mainstream movies. 
[02:06:30]  And Crazy Heart, fucking Jeff Bridges should have been dead at the end of the movie.  But they had to cop that out, too.  We need more people to see the movie.  Then we'll discuss that one next.  You just blew it.  Nah, not really.  Not really.  I, I, I.  Who gives a shit?  No, no.  Give me a few more days, and then we'll talk about Crazy Heart.  Maybe a few more people are going to see it.  But they did.  I mean, you want to talk about copping out.  They've totally copped out in Crazy Heart. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  I'm just trying to think of.  All right.  Like, what could have happened there?  What?  At the end.  Of what?  Copping out of Crazy Heart.  Well.  I didn't say it, but I'm just trying to figure.  I mean, it's a, it's a pretty good movie.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's not bad.  I mean, it's, it's a little slow, but that fucking Jeff Bridges knows how to act.  That fucking guy knows how to act.  Holy shit.  Go see Crazy Heart, Jimmy.  I will.  And then we'll discuss it.  And then you guys start getting trailers.  Discuss.  You guys start getting, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
[02:07:30]  Some copies.  Some copies, I mean.  Yeah, I'm working on it.  Uh.  Screeners.  Let's say hi to Blake in Wisconsin.  Blake.  But I would never see that fucking George Clooney piece of shit.  I knew right away I am not fucking seeing that.  But some of these movies are worth seeing just for the show.  So you can beat the shit out of them.  I can't even sit through.  I would, I would fuck.  I couldn't sit through it.  Honestly, if we didn't have a radio show, I wouldn't see half the stuff I do.  But then you see it so you can beat the shit out of it.  Blake, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, I was just, uh, calling about Jim's comment about putting, uh, real ugly people in movies. 
[02:08:00]  Um, I just spent the weekend at the Mall of America.  I could see ugly people anywhere I go.  I'm paying money to save pretty people.  Well, there's reality TV stars all over.  Really, Sarah Jessica Parker is about my limit to ugly people that I can deal with.  Well, if you're paying money to see pretty people, then your level of entertainment is obviously what it is.  Then don't ever belt.  If you want to pay to see pretty people.  I don't want to go and see ugly people at the movie theater, dude.  So you enjoy looking at George Clooney on the big screen. 
[02:08:30]  Okay, then you want a fucking bullshit message given to you by really good-looking people  pretending to understand the plight of someone who doesn't get laid.  Or, you know, come on, stop.  No, you're right.  Uh, Glennon Paltrow, it was, uh, that was a clutch fuck.  But, uh, I don't know.  I like Anne Hathaway.  All right.  I'm not saying I don't like Anne Hathaway.  And I don't even say good-looking people shouldn't be in movies.  But I'm just sick and tired of supposed to feel sorry for these people.  You know, I don't feel sorry for any. 
[02:09:00]  Look at the cast of Cuckoo's Nest.  If they cast that movie today, every one of those fucking mental patients, they would never cast Danny DeVito.  They would never cast any of these.  They would all be good-looking, you know, uh, fucking sulky, unshaven Hollywood types.  Bunch of shit.  The people getting fired and up in the air, that was some good shit.  Yeah, they were all ugly.  They were all ugly.  I deserve to be fired.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  We're going to move on.  There's too much going on here right now.  We'll go to Mike in Florida.  Mike?  Hey, I saw Book of Eli.  Hey, guys. 
[02:09:30]  Book of Eli.  I saw it this weekend.  Have you guys seen it yet?  No, I'm not.  It's terrible.  It is, huh?  Is it getting bad reviews?  I think it is getting bad reviews.  I don't know.  I mean, there's nothing even to spoil about it except for one thing, whether, um, I don't  know, whether he's blind or not.  I can't figure that out.  Book of Eli, I got confused because there's a movie out, or was out, or coming out soon  called The Road, which was an amazing-  I saw that, too.  The Road was an amazing book.  I was looking forward to the fucking movie.  Omar from The Wire's in it. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, I never saw this.  It never hit my theaters, and I live in New York City.  Where the fuck was this movie being shown?  Uh, it was on my computer, is where I saw it.  That everyone does.  It was good.  It was good.  It was depressing.  They did a good job giving you a feel for the post-apocalyptic world without spending  a lot of money.  Right.  So I give them credit for that, but, I mean, it was kind of depressing, but it was a lot  better than Book of Eli.  I never give credit to a studio for doing something on a low budget. 
[02:10:30]  I don't care how much it costs.  Isn't that the director doing that, though?  Being able to be creative enough to do that?  Nah, it's the studio, also.  If you have a cap on spending, then you have to.  Oh, then fuck the studio, because there were good people in that movie, so.  It was like, what was a good movie?  It was that Stephen King movie that Frank something, uh, remember the guy, the director  came in to promote it, about the, uh, yeah, he came in, and the movie was about  the, uh, the fog that came, the mist, oh, the mist, oh, the mist, that was a good movie.  The movie was even darker than the book, but the fucking, the budget was low, and the 
[02:11:00]  monsters were, oh, it was actually a guy with monster gloves on, who's terrible.  It really is, his movies, they cannot, they can't make the monsters look good.  No.  In any one of his movies.  I don't get it.  Fuck, that was a good review on, up in the air.  I wanted more people who disagreed with me to call in, because they were on Twitter,  so I don't mind listening to them.  Yeah, I got beat up a little bit when I first started talking about that.  Yeah, yeah, when you first, if I recall, when you first talked about that.  You were like, you just don't get it, man.  No, when I, I first remember you saw it, and started talking about it, I think you were 
[02:11:30]  giving it some kudos, my friend.  I don't think so.  Might have to pull the clip and hang you out to dry.  I got it.  I got it.  I just didn't want to hear from Clooney.  Why not give me credit for good stuff for once, instead of just killing me all the time.  No, no.  I'm trying to think if I did now.  I'm just saying, you might have gone, it was good, but.  I was trying, I don't know, I was, maybe, I didn't go, I didn't go all in like Jimmy  did, that's for sure.  But I definitely had problems with him.  Jimmy apparently loved it. 
[02:12:00]  I think what I said, Ant, I think I really did say, my main point about Up in the Air  was, what was the point of this movie?  Oh, yeah.  And then people were like, you don't get it, man.  You don't get it, man?  Ugh.  Ugh.  Just be pussy whipped and go to a fucking chick flicker.  Exactly.  And like it, because you have to.  Hey guys, Andy Dick's in trouble again.  Oh no.  We're going to talk about him next time.  That guy's unpredictable.  We're going to, uh, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma,  ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma. 
[02:12:30]  and then we're going to talk about this  fucking piece of shit woman that  fell on a Picasso  did you read this one  no but I saw it on the news  did you read this one  why do you hear this story  this fucking idiot  and then the Haiti telethon  we might talk about that a little bit  they raised I think close to 60 million dollars  Jesus  my favorite part though was  the big Hollywood stars talking to the average  Joes  but it was great 
[02:13:00]  here's Julia Roberts  and she's just talking to some housewife  from the midwest  imagine the joy she must have there  and relating to her  this is Julia Roberts  me and my husband were saying the exact same thing last night  when we were pulling out of our gated  huge mansion  thank you  I said the same thing to my husband  while I was jerking him off with an 11 carat ring  on my finger  what did you say trailer trash  what did you say  fucking gutter white lady 
[02:13:30]  this might work then  I'm not sure  I was thinking this might work  it might not  and then someone's like  oh it's a pleasure to talk to you  Mr. Spielberg  and Steven Spielberg goes  well it's a pleasure to talk to you as well  you know I  I'm interested in making movies myself  right  are you  are you really  let me sit down with Spielberg  and pitch my fucking idea  alright we'll give it a try next  we'll talk about the Haiti telethon  Haiti  Opie and Anthony  hey let's not forget 
[02:14:00]  Ozzy Osbourne  will be in studio tomorrow  Ozzy Osbourne  yeah Jimmy's been  perusing his book  and doing nothing but laughing  his little ass off  at Ozzy's book  loves the book  yeah we did the  the old football talk earlier  yeah  what else you want us to say  Colts were the better team  the better team 
[02:14:30]  they came with the game face on  they came to play  yeah  yeah  hell of a year for my Jets  they're my Jets  and  I own the team  does no good though  the old  nice year  almost did it  next year  doesn't help  fuck we were like  we were one half away  from a Super Bowl appearance  the first one in 41 years  and now we're probably  going to have to wait another  yeah  god knows how many years  to get that close again  hell knows  it was a good ride though man  a lot of fun the last few weeks  with the Jets 
[02:15:00]  now I can completely focus  on hockey  it's all about hockey now  hockey  holy shit  who is that  that's little Emma Watson  really  yeah  bo bo bo  from the Harry Potter movies  she's all grown up  she's trying to glam herself up  a little bit  yeah  she's got hips  like a little nine year old boy  she looks great there  but in general  she's just alright  yeah  I think she's just alright  you saw the  the Harry Potter movie  right  the latest one  no I have not seen  the latest Harry Potter movie  I still have to catch up 
[02:15:30]  with  eight of them  oh really  yeah well  really  really  hey  Jimmy did the old  Pope  the Pope thing  of course he did  where the fuck  am I going here  where's the  okay  Jimmy did the  the Pope  the Pope bit  on Friday  and we all were doing  the  he was just doing  a little  totally do  totally do song  and Jimmy goes  oh I forgot I even did that  which is just a shame  because it's a great bit 
[02:16:00]  it really is a great bit  if you didn't mention it  I never would have  thought of it again  the Pope  so Derek took  the Pope song  I mean  he made it into a song  actually  that's what Derek does  because Jimmy was just  riffing about things  the Pope does  basically  and then Derek  grabbed the raw audio  raw audio  and came up with this  oh the Pope wears  a pointy white hat 
[02:16:30]  doodly dood  he says things  about God  that are nice  oh the Pope  speaks Latin  doodly doo  oh the Pope  lives in Rome  yes he does  oh the Pope  likes God  a whole big bunch  oh the Pope  enjoys the view  from the balcony  doodly doo  and the Pope  leans his head  out the window  and boos  at synagogues  oh the Pope's car  has a piece  of plastic on it  oh the Pope 
[02:17:00]  really digs  Mel Gibson's movies  the Pope says  T H  after a lot of words  to sound holy  and the Pope  likes a Bible  in the hotel room drawer  the Pope wears  a pointy white hat  doodly doo  he says things  about God  that are nice  oh the Pope  speaks Latin  doodly doo  oh the Pope  lives in Rome  yes he does  I'm fucking  a good singer  that's a hit  you probably  have more songs 
[02:17:30]  that get more airplay  on the radio  than a lot of bands  that should be  getting airplay  I sing quite a bit  it's my second passion  after shit sculpting  after making  historical figures  out of liquid shit  it's singing  I actually like  a good solid one too  I did an amazing  Lincoln once  with a real fiber log  that stovepipe hat  a little easier  with the fibrous  than  much easier  the stovepipe hat  always collapses  flu shits are no good 
[02:18:00]  flu shits are no good  at all  unless you're doing  tsunami stuff  or ocean  ocean paintings  or abstract  yeah  kind of modern art  modern art masterpiece  you know what  I'm going to go  with the seg  speaking of art  ah  she puts the ass  in picasso  but picasso  picasso  but it's picasso  what would it be  before that  if without that  it would be what  pico  yeah  she puts the ass  in picasso  that's a dumb headline  masterpiece  if she didn't fall  forward  it would be  picanto  although the article 
[02:18:30]  starts off fine  it says  a klutzy art lover  this story rules  tripped on  onto  ok  a klutzy art lover  tripped onto  a rare picasso  painting at the met  tearing a hole  in the century  old masterpiece  jesus  first of all  how do they  display it  what do they  just have it  up there  yeah really  what the fuck  it's hanging  like a fucking  like a target 
[02:19:00]  on the shooting  range  how about you  cover that  with glass  so fucking  candela  can't fall  into it  yeah really  it's a picasso  you fucking  idiot  what a stupid  bitch  the unidentified  woman was  attending an  adult education  class Friday  afternoon when  she lost her  balance  and stumbled  into the  actor causing  a six inch  tear in the  bottom of the  canvas  the piece  called the  actor  do you know  how shitty  you feel  when you fall  into a picasso  i'd feel bad  if i tripped  and fell in  on paul stanley's 
[02:19:30]  paintings  fortunately the  damage did not  occur in a  focal point of  the composition  that's very  artsy  the focal point  of the  composition  six inch  tear how do  they fix that  wouldn't it be  funny if some  guy just came  over and put  just tape on  it  fine  they'll probably  spend ten years  fixing it now  they'll get it  fixed  the damage can  be fully  repaired  the actor's all  skinny  how can it be 
[02:20:00]  fully repaired  if it's a rip  right it can't  be fully repaired  right  but i mean  if you take it  on  antique road  show i think  they're gonna  notice sorry  yeah uh this  would have been  worth a lot  if some  dummy didn't  sit on it  what phase was  that uh when  he was going  through the  blue phase  the actor has  on blue  shoes  no no  it's not his  uh final phase  before he died  that's for sure  uh first of all  there's a few  things about this  pablo picasso  created the actor  an unusually large  painting measuring 
[02:20:30]  about six feet  four six feet  by four feet  wow and the  dummy tumbles  into it  in the winter  of 04  art 5  art 5  it depicts  an acrobat  striking a pose  and marks a  transition  oh  to the artist's  uh rose period  the rose period  she fell into a  six foot painting  yes  what a fucking  clod  i didn't see it  i thought it was  the real actor  dunce  how do you fall 
[02:21:00]  into a six foot  masterpiece  what an asshole  it's true  it's a masterpiece  and she fell into it  she should have  her name changed  to fucking asshole  legally on her  license  asshole  comma fucking  you know what  fucking a  keith  we have the best  listeners ever  and i really mean  that  because they pick  up on the stuff  that we should be  at times  keith jay from  niger falls  because what  do they say  they said that  uh 
[02:21:30]  uh  this will be  fully repaired  right  yeah  so keith jay  writes  what is  picasso  going to  come back  and fix it  you know what  happened  this reminds me  of something  embarrassing  i did too  yeah  there was a  monet  and i ran  through it  like the wily  coyote  thing does  and there was  just the outline  of me  you thought it  was a tunnel  it was an  accident yeah  but they fixed  it right  jimmy  uh  they did  yes  yeah  that's good  to hear  they just had  me stand  there  like i was  part of the  painting  oh uh 
[02:22:00]  rick has a  very very  good question  uh rick in  missouri rick  are they going  to be bringing  the painting  to ted's  art repair  emporium  yes they are  yeah ted  you're going to  be fixing  the picasso  painting  i certainly  am  i told them  though to  ship it  to fold it  up and put  it in an  envelope  and mail it  to me  well that  doesn't sound  like it would  be safe  yes i'll  unfold it  quietly and  carefully  i'll have  this thing  fixed in a  jif gregory  how long is  it going to  take uh  probably about a  minute and a  half  send it right 
[02:22:30]  back here's  your picasso  you can't do  that  sure you can't  nobody looks  at the back  how much do  you charge to  fix a masterpiece  like this  picacho painting  four dollars  depends on how  much tape i have  to use  sometimes i'll  fold the tape  up under where  you can see it  on the front of  the painting  so you'll know  it's been repaired  and i'll also  sign it  how is your  business going  to make money  oh i just do  a lot of  painting fixings  how many a  year  oh approximately  35 for 40  oh that's not  a lot of money  it certainly is  you'd be surprised  how many people  fall into  picassos 
[02:23:00]  one every  1600 years  stupid bitch  what a  clod  holy shit  what a  clod  oh god  i hate that  painting by the  way that  fucking skinny  long necked  idiot painting  you don't like  that no the  actor's got the  fruity hands on  the head  he has his  hands out like  kind of like  this it's  terrible do you  like picassos i  like picassos  i don't like when  he started putting  the nose on the  side of the head  and all that weird  shit but he did 
[02:23:30]  do some stuff that  wasn't weird  some skinny  asshole with  blue shoes  fucking dumb  rocket boots  nice fucking  rocket boots  he's wearing ace  freely's uh  exactly the  actor  it's the actor  i'm pretty uh  basic when it  comes to paintings  i like your  portraits you think  the old school  stuff like that  sure that's  fine by me  uh nothing  nothing too  wacky  anthony likes  it simple like  hitler ice skating  in a santa hat 
[02:24:00]  there's nothing  wrong with that  scott s from  quakertown  remember the day  we ripped the  painting  i like a good  black woman with  a huge afro so i  could look over my  toes  base on my bed  yeah i like that  too  those macadamia  nut toes  fucking scatman  crothers  coke logic writes  she probably burst  through the painting  like a college  football banner  what a quad  yeah like me at 
[02:24:30]  the end of uh  that show on  ifc  all right  remember when i  ran through the  fucking  oh yes  jimmy the wrestler  what was your  character's name  again  just uh jim the  animal norton  yeah yeah  uh what else we  got on this the  artwork which was  donated to the met  oh that was a good  decision huh  back in 1952  hung in a second  floor gallery without  incident until  friday so it was  it was hanging  there for well  over 50 years and  no one bothered it  until this clod came  along put it behind  glass the painting is 
[02:25:00]  expected to be repaired  in time to go on  display in the  exhibit of some of uh  250 picasso works  that opens april 27th  fuck i'll be there for  that why is he so  famous he painted  i can see if he  painted one that has a  shitload of paintings  i don't know why i  don't know why that  shit is famous i walk  through museums every  once in a while and  you're like why is  this why is this one  really famous and this  one over here is not  it's the same thing  uh well there it is  the scatman brothers  i like that one that  was great says 
[02:25:30]  something talks to  you oh you know  what i i do remember  this story john in  queens go ahead john  good morning boys hey  hey i don't know if  anybody brought it up  yet but uh i read a  story once that steve  winn had this  multi-million dollar  painting that he was  selling to somebody and  when he brought the  people in to show the  painting so he put his  elbow through it that's  a true story if we  steve winn put his  elbow through it yeah  why would he make a  joke and want the  paintings to laugh  it was a mona lisa he 
[02:26:00]  said come on smile you're  conned you're embarrassing  me  watch it out boy  he cut the mouth out so  he could kind of talk  through it  how do you elbow a  hole in a painting  there it is it's right  here or maybe he would  do that maybe he would  act like an old school  actor all the time and  someone would say  something he'd go  his elbows would kick  back  how do you do that  oh no  so there you go that  dumb bitch  messing up a picasso

[02:46:30]  my jew god  or your stupid  faith god  help out in  this way at  this time  no it's it's  the most important  time to help  out because you  know the most  important thing of  course is to get  everything on the  ground  yeah  uh and right  and what they  really need is  money money and  medical personnel  yeah they need  antibiotics  unless it's the  buildings  they need a lot  of things  you know they  need uh you  know something as  small as solar  flash you know  solar powered  flashlights  yes yes  and generators  and things that  just adjust  to try to  somewhat rebuild 
[02:47:00]  the infrastructure  which would also  get more people  more doctors  closer to the  people who need  the help  i know a girl  they called her  solar class  but it's it's  it's such a  disaster  and you know  what you've done  and what your  congregation is  doing we really  appreciate  uh yeah my  congregation has  donated also but  we're hearing a little  snippet of hope on  the radio like more  water is available  today and different  things like that  exactly and there's  some really smart  people there on the  ground helping out  so you know i get  very encouraged  when i see how  much intelligence 
[02:47:30]  is really operating  and disseminating  all of the  the vital materials  that need to get  to the people who  need it the most  every single day  it sort of builds  my confidence that  it's being handled  very well  it seems like  they're doing it  the right way  the best way they  can  exactly  exactly  well listen  thank you so much  reverend for what  you've done  well thank you for  answering calls  and making people  saved in this way  okay  take care  have a good weekend  you too  bye bye  are you here

[03:08:30]  and he was on  one of  ah fuck  I did it again  look at you  and he was on  one of Dr. Drew's  fucking attic shows  I guess he's back  partying  patty time  he was down  in West Virginia  and this is what  happened  we're talking about  Andy Dick  over the weekend  who had a less  stellar  less than stellar  weekend  he was arrested  in West Virginia  after you know  allegedly he grabbed  a man's crotch  and then repeatedly  began groping  and kissing him  according to police  in West Virginia  he was performing 
[03:09:00]  at a club  he ended up  at a bar later  according to the  police report  he quote  unexpectedly  and without invitation  started sort of  harassing this one  patron at the bar  that's his mug shot  kind of looks almost  like a publicity photo  well you know  the key now  these stars say  you gotta smile  for the mug shot  knowing that it's  gonna be broadcast  everywhere  but you know  these are serious  charges  I mean these are  felony counts  and Andy Dick  is actually on  probation already  stemming from a  July 2008 incident  in California  where he ended up  getting charged  with battery  and drug possession  so he was already  sort of on the hook  legally 
[03:09:30]  and now this happened  in West Virginia  and who knows  what's gonna happen  to his career  but who knows  what's gonna happen  in terms of the  legal process  moving on  yeah it really has  been a messy  couple of years  for Andy Dick  I've never found him  funny  I don't know  he's a little off the wall  newsreader  I never really found him  funny  yeah I'm sure  gives a fuck  what you thought  maybe a little gossip  guy  I don't find him funny  but you know  I don't honestly know  anything he does  I really don't know  one thing he's done  but he does either  I don't think he does  anything  what  Andy Dick  he was on news radio 
[03:10:00]  alright  what like an actor  he was news radio  he was an actor  a comic  I don't really know  what he's done  in a long time  if you were a comic  Opie  like you're longer  from who  oh my god  remember that  more abuse from you  to me  no  Anthony  why the  what's wrong with you  we're getting along lately  why the abuse  oh my god  that's a famous  old line  who said that  as a matter of fact  you're the only one  who remembers  because you like  when people beat me up  so you're right  what's wrong with you

[03:11:00]  Lady Gaga  Ozzy Osbourne  and  and Barry  Barry  get the fuck out of here  that's funny  what happened  well it looks like  somebody knows  what they're talking about  there's where the confusion  may come in  holy shit  yep  what the fuck is that about  are they going to sing together  I don't know  I hope so  you said  hey this isn't a  Barry Manilow concert  of course I did  and it was at Ozzy  did he actually say that  I think so 
[03:11:30]  did he actually  did he  you know something  I'm not sure now  just because they're going to be together  on Kimmel  doesn't necessarily mean  that Jimmy said that  we don't need to hear it now  we all know we're going to hear it tomorrow  so we're really not sure  you said it  Steve from Bayshore  said Barry's going to bite  the head off the cock  Steve  and he's going to make the balls  like bat wings  he's going to stretch them down  god damn  Steve from Bayshore  the funny fuck  what do we have on that Andy Dick story  so if you squeeze some guy's 
[03:12:00]  fucking dick  you can get a felony assault  he can't be touching no dick  but he says it's not true  why don't that guy  just punch him in the face  I don't know  Andy Dick seems like  the type of guy  you can take down  pretty easily  you can probably hit  and put him out  pretty quick  if it's a big fucking  black gangster  you might not  try to punch him in the face  Andy Dick don't get that pod  touching his  his wee wee  his penis  friends junk  it's a man's penis  being touched  speaking of grabbing

[03:21:30]  supposedly  but  the G&R  people saying  fake  that they  didn't come  out with that  story  it's a  rumor  but they  would say  that  they look  kind of like  assholes  of course  it's true  I guarantee  they did it  well I can't  guarantee shit  you have a mic  in front of you  it seems like  something they would  do  Axl seems to be  a complete  fucking lunatic  a dush  hey  and then  speaking of music  sad day  that great band  Scorpions  oh yes 
[03:22:00]  are disbanding  after next album  and tour  oh  what  that's not  so they're doing  a farewell  bullshit  that's just to get  some attention  for their next  album and tour  and then  you know  it goes  very well  and they go  you know  we've decided  to do  one more  album  exactly  so that's just  a crap  announcement  for real  cause I mean  after next album  tour  that's at least  a year  to 18  so  why announce it  so that means  they're still  going strong  ass bullshit  and uh 
[03:22:30]  Jersey Shore  cast wants  ten thousand  dollars per episode  that thing is done  they're getting  hundreds I guess  a couple of hundred  per episode now  they want  ten thousand  per episode  and  they'll probably  get it  I don't think  they will  but these guys  you want to talk  about a shooting  star  holy shit  a year from now  no one's going  to be talking  about the  Jersey Shore  people  it pretty much  peaked  very quickly  I like  I was all  about it  for a second  if I may say  all about it  but uh  this is just  kinda 
[03:23:00]  eh  once you see  the girl  get punched  how much better  is that gonna get  there's a lot  of punching  going on  Ronnie  knocked  somebody out  yeah  but this is a better  show on TV  now  the guy  that lives  in his parents  basement  and he's  trying to get  a broad  is that a good  show  yeah I don't  know the name  of it  Sam's watching  it too  and it's like  uh  and they had  a softball game  yeah  and an idea  where I'm like  why the fuck  didn't we do  this idea  at our  fucking softball  game  first of all  no one wants  to see us  play  they want to  see the  broads play  yeah  so we had  a softball  game  one team  was called  meatballs

[03:24:00]  we're told  the cast  rejected the  offer  and made  it clear  they would  still stand  together  and hold  out for  their prize  though they  didn't say  what it was  they are  really stupid  because this  show could  work with a  whole new  cast  a whole new  cast  they could  get more  characters  it says  MTV made  a new  offer of  $10,000  an episode  there are  12 episodes  in the new  season  so you're  talking 120  G's  but so far  the cast  hasn't responded  goodbye  the second  season is  going to  just suck  goodbye  you could

[03:33:00]  directed towards  this channel  which only wants to  help our fellow  members of the  flock  when will people  learn that God  will never give  them up  never let them  down  never run around  or hurt  fun  I mean she's  right isn't  there  yes I mean  I'm afraid I  smile at that  one because  there's been an  onslaught of such  emails coming in  and that's from a  song you see  so it could be  that someone's out  there just trying  to have a laugh  but actually  I'm not I don't  want to diminish  if it's a genuine 
[03:33:30]  email  fucking Rick  rolled  Rick rolled in an  email that's  fantastic  the next one  was  should we  give it away  no try to  figure out  what this  one is  there's someone  who's written  a story here  it's a long  one  it says I'm  a nearly born  again Christian  and would like  to share my  story of  salvation with  you  I was born  in West  Philadelphia  and also  raised there  I spent most  of my days  playing basketball  on the playground  but also  chilling out  and relaxing  but then one 
[03:34:00]  day a couple  of guys  who were up  to no good  started making  trouble  in my  living area  I ended up  getting into  a fight  which terrified  my mother  as a result  she sent me  away from  West Philadelphia  to the most  peaceful area  of Bel Air  oh okay  fresh  I think  yeah I think  there's someone  there's some  Mongolians  on the system  fresh  prince of
