<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts' characteristic vulgar banter, quickly shifting to a discussion of James Gandolfini's death.  They dissect the outpouring of grief online, analyze TMZ's sensationalized reporting on a supposed pre-death tattoo parlor visit, and delve into memorable *Sopranos* scenes and the show's cultural impact.  A clip from *Inside the Actors Studio* featuring Gandolfini is played. A caller, Max, a *Sopranos*-themed YouTuber, calls in, initially expressing grief and mimicking Gandolfini's voice.  His conversation takes a dark turn as he reveals his daughter was raped, connecting this trauma to his emotional response to Gandolfini's death. He further discusses his often sexually suggestive *Sopranos* videos and impersonations. The segment continues with the hosts and Max engaging in highly vulgar and sexually explicit conversation about Gandolfini's legacy and the emotional impact of his death.

The show then transitions to a discussion of a past broadcast where they harshly criticized a Bobby Moynihan *Saturday Night Live* Drunk Uncle sketch, unaware Moynihan was a fan. They replay audio of their critique and a subsequent interview with Moynihan, acknowledging the awkwardness of their initial judgment.  They speculate on the reasons for their harsh assessment, mentioning Jim Norton's possible influence and the context of the benefit performance.  The conversation meanders through various unrelated topics including a hockey game, a news report's awkward commercial break, numerous off-color jokes, and anecdotes from their show's history, all punctuated with vulgar language and offensive humor.  They briefly play a song, mention upcoming tour dates and podcast episodes, and conclude the segment with a discussion of possibly having Moynihan as a guest.

The next segment focuses heavily on E-Rock and his reaction to a song, "Big Fat Guy," written about him by Sean F., along with the gift of Goldfish crackers.  The song is repeatedly played, with E-Rock expressing displeasure and calling Sean F. a "psychopath" despite the gift.  The hosts then discuss a podcast promo overloaded with Sean F.'s E-Rock songs. A significant portion is dedicated to a Tom Papa sketch featuring Amy Schumer and Matt Damon, with discussion of Papa's connections to other celebrities (Jerry Seinfeld, Clint Eastwood), including a clip from Seinfeld's "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" showing Ricky Gervais's fear of Seinfeld's driving. A soundbite from Lyle Chipperson's "Porno for the Blind" is played.  Elijah Wood, a guest in the studio, discusses his work on *Wilfred*, *The Hobbit*, and *Maniac* (described graphically, including an "Achilles slush" scene), press junkets, talk show experiences (Letterman, Arsenio Hall), and his views on *The Tonight Show*'s changes.  The segment ends with further discussion of E-Rock's Tequila and Donuts stunt.

The show continues with a discussion of the new Black Sabbath and Daft Punk albums, interspersed with other topics. E-Rock is mentioned playing music, including a track requested by Elijah Wood.  Ricky Gervais, a guest in studio, delivers a humorous, often vulgar critique of Opie and Anthony's work ethic and absences, using strong language to comment on their performance and compensation. A Dollar Shave Club advertisement airs.  Anthony calls in to playfully address Gervais's comments and explain his absence. Gervais discusses his views on comedy, offense, and comedians' responsibility to their audience, again using strong language, and his weight loss journey.  A detailed discussion of the UFC ensues with Gervais offering insights and opinions.

The final segment features Gervais discussing freedom of speech, offense, and their often-misunderstood relationship. He argues offense is collateral damage of free speech, differentiating between choosing not to consume content and attempting to censor it. He uses the analogy of a comedian's stage as their "church."  He discusses the misuse of "militant atheist," the burden of proof regarding God, and differing reactions to jokes about sensitive topics like rape, the Holocaust, and pedophilia.  Notable moments include his anecdote about a woman's refusal to laugh at a rape joke unless she knew no one in the audience had been raped, his witty retorts to those misunderstanding his comedy, and his use of hyperbolic examples (Hitler's words vs. genocide). He discusses humor's role in processing difficult subjects.  The discussion shifts to Gervais's David Brent YouTube videos and the absurd negative reactions he receives online, likened to criticizing town notice board notices. The segment concludes with promotion of *Life's Too Short* and *Derek*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fleshly.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten egg from Sue.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning, everybody.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, there we go.  Ah, yeah.  It's so weird when a celebrity dies.  What?  Sometimes you feel really fucking close to the guy, even though you've never met him.  Celebrity died?  What happened here?  Fucking Twitter blew up yesterday afternoon.  Ah, yeah.  With the news of James Gandolfini. 
[00:02:30]  This one fucking hurts, right?  There was a time you're like, ah, that kind of sucks.  I kind of liked him in this blah, blah movie or whatever.  But this one, man, you can see it on Twitter.  People are really, really fucking bummed.  Yeah, when you have a character that he played like that, like Tony Soprano, you know, every  Sunday.  Yeah.  There you were.  Yeah.  What's gonna happen?  What is that?  What's the deal?  What's he going?  And, uh, yeah.  Or marathoning that shit where you're like, oh, God, I gotta just do one more episode. 
[00:03:00]  One more.  Yeah.  And that one more turns into five.  Exactly.  Six, seven.  It was, uh, you know, it was the character he played.  Right.  Let's, let's, let's be honest here.  I think a lot of people are more upset that Tony Soprano is gone.  Right.  Of course.  Than James Gandolfini.  It's terrible.  But, you know, we get very attached to, uh, characters.  The character.  The character.  51 is way too young.  Jeez.  And they, people were saying with all that wheezing and how fucking big he had gotten 
[00:03:30]  and stuff.  It's like, eh, I don't know.  They, they had a couple, uh, pictures of him posted and he looked like he was dropping  weight.  Really?  Recent ones?  Yeah.  I don't know.  TMZ had to like try to make a stretch that he was in a, in a tattoo parlor, you know,  uh, looking at tats and he was going to come back with a special design.  Really?  And that was, uh, I don't know, a couple months ago.  And I'm like, what does that have to do with what happened in it?  Yeah, there you go.  Shopping before death.  Oh God.  But it turns out he was in the tattoo parlor like two months ago. 
[00:04:00]  Oh.  But they make it look like this is what he looked, you know, what he was doing a day  before he died.  Yeah.  He did look thinner there though.  Yeah.  That's what I was saying.  He does look thinner there.  I wonder if he was taking something when he was working out or dieting.  Sometimes there's things, supplements or things you take while you're dieting can cause  your heart and give you a heart a problem.  I like the speculation.  Nice.  He was just an unhealthy guy in general.  Yeah, I am.  And he died of a massive heart attack in Italy.  I think they could just leave off the word massive. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I know.  What is that?  Massive.  They love saying that.  Right.  What does that, what does that headline say, Sam?  It just says shopping before death or is there more to it?  Tattoo shopping before death.  So you go, wow, this is what he was doing the day before.  And then you read a little bit and you realize, no, this was back in what?  The photo was taken on June 1st, which was like three weeks ago.  Okay.  So he wasn't shopping before his death for a tattoo.  Right.  God, these fucking people like to stretch everything. 
[00:05:00]  What's an exclusive?  Yeah.  What's this?  He went tattoo shopping three weeks ago.  It's not like he was having chest pains while he was in there.  Right.  Ugh.  But I clicked on it because I'm thinking, oh, okay, this is the picture they took of  him the day before in Italy or something.  No.  Yeah.  This picture is three weeks ago and it was in another country.  Yeah.  It was over there in Italy.  Apparently you didn't read all the details.  Oh.  Oh.  The actor was extremely excited about a new tattoo he was planning.  Okay.  Oh.  That was kind of the big juicy. 
[00:05:30]  But that's three weeks ago.  And who cares?  I didn't do anything.  Is it a tattoo?  That's stupid TMZ.  Did it say I ordered for the table underneath the tattoo?  Eastside Dave's tattoo.  Eastside Dave's tattoo is very valuable to him.  Oh, yeah.  The owner says Gandolfini was in great spirits during the visit.  Oh.  That's good that he was three weeks ago.  I'm wondering how a guy is almost a month before heart attack.  Yeah.  He was in a good mood three weeks ago.  I would assume he would be.  He had a pretty damn good life. 
[00:06:00]  Or if he wasn't, that would be fine, too.  It has nothing to do with...  But I got tricked.  I clicked on it.  And then I just started yelling at my computer.  I'm like, this is three weeks ago.  Three weeks ago.  It has nothing to do with the story.  Of course not.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  Very sad.  He didn't even have a real plan for a tattoo.  No.  He promised to return later in the month for a full session, but didn't tell the guy what  he wanted.  So now the headline is that James Gandolfini was in the market for a mysterious new ink 
[00:06:30]  job before his death.  Oh, God.  What are you doing?  There's nothing for them to talk about other than that.  He's dead.  So talk about what his life was like.  Right.  He wasn't...  Who cares if he's going to get a tattoo?  They want the exclusive angle.  How about you talk about how he's one of the greatest actors of our time?  Period.  And he was just going to continue adding to his legacy.  He was a great actor.  Yeah.  So what was he doing over there in Italy?  He was vacationing with his young son.  A young son in the car. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  And he was a really young one.  He was in the sun when it happened?  I guess.  He was over there with his son.  That's all I know.  Oh.  Jeez.  And then, yeah, he's got a very, very young daughter.  And Italian food is very rich.  A daughter that's only a few months old, I believe.  Yeah.  With his new wife.  That's his kid?  Yep.  Yeah.  He was in the middle of a guy's trip.  Him and his son.  Yeesh.  Oh, horrible.  Awful.  Just really sad.  Yeah, it's pretty bad right there. 
[00:07:30]  Did he get a guy's trip?  His son just graduated from eighth grade.  Ah.  Oh, your father's your hero.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's like, you know.  He's not just some shitty dad, but he's like Tony Soprano.  Everywhere he goes.  Although, yeah, you remember.  You're not so young.  You don't remember.  Oh, yeah.  Everywhere he goes, he gets respect and treated great.  The kid was probably looking forward to this, too.  Father-son trip.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Making it hurt.  Can you imagine that?  No, of course.  Father-son trip to Italy and how shitty Gandolfini would feel leaving his son there. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Fucking terrible.  Yeah, and then the kids, they're like, hey, I'm in fucking eighth grade.  Now I'm alone in Italy with my fucking father's body.  Oh, Jesus.  Ah.  Yeah, so what does he do?  Stay in the hotel while the mom comes, you think?  You don't send him back alone, right?  His mom jumped on a plane.  Okay.  Yeah, but he's just sitting there.  Yeah.  So what do you, what was it, it doesn't say what they were doing yet. 
[00:08:30]  Like, was it a hotel or was he?  I'm sure a lot of shit will come out today.  Oh, yeah.  Were they out and about?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm sure he wasn't out and about because how we live these days, there would have been  a picture online with him on the fucking ground somewhere.  So I'm sure he wasn't.  TMZ exclusive, I bet.  Of course.  Well, but TMZ doesn't have the exclusive, so they're talking about him tattoo shopping  three weeks ago in L.A., which has nothing to do with Italy.  How about you talk about him and his son did that morning, if you know anything topical? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, they don't have anything.  That's why.  So they're stretching and reaching for straws here.  James Gandolfini bought a hat once on the set of True Romance.  Right.  It's got nothing to do with what just happened.  They had this scoop three weeks ago and decided, well, now it's a hot story.  Now we've got to run with this.  Run with it.  Go with it.  Lead with it.  Yeah.  Well, that's just weird that we just started talking about The Sopranos again, only recently.  What the fuck's that about?  We, uh, I bet if you look back, though, we always are just recently talking about The  Sopranos.  Yeah.  We're like, we never stopped. 
[00:09:30]  Anybody from The Shining or The Sopranos?  There's a couple of shows, if anybody dies, it's got something to do with us.  I guess he was going to receive an award at a film festival.  Oh, I'm getting that from The Dark Knight.  Dark Knight, 8425.  So he took his son over there.  Yeah.  Wow.  Have they received the award yet, or were they there early?  I don't know, man.  That blows.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  I was also yelling at the TV.  I almost tweeted.  I'm Piers Morgan.  You know, he did a whole hour on James Gandolfini on CNN last night, and he just kept going 
[00:10:00]  to the medical dude and was like hinting, like, you know, he had problems in the past, and  you know, just trying to say that, you know.  Yeah.  Trying to figure out how he died, and making it sound like, you know, he wasn't living  a healthy lifestyle.  And I'm like, who gives a fuck?  He just died.  He's one of the greatest actors, certainly character actors of our time.  So why don't you focus on that?  All that other shit will come out in a day or two.  Piers is an asshole anyway. 
[00:10:30]  But it's like he was just, he was doing that tabloid shit.  That's that English fucking mentality.  And I understand they gotta do that tabloid shit.  We do that tabloid shit.  But it was too fresh.  Just fucking talk about the man, and how he influenced, how he watched TV, and how HBO  changed after The Sopranos.  Yeah, that pretty much was the death knell for fucking network television, and the stupid  fucking series.  Where everyone was like, really? 
[00:11:00]  I gotta watch this?  Where they're not speaking honestly, and using real language.  And then Sopranos comes on, and you're like, oh, well.  You know, the network's turned it down.  Really?  Yeah, Sopranos.  I'm glad.  They would've ruined it.  Of course they would've ruined it.  They would've ruined that amazing show.  Every dialogue line.  The little line, Cousin Junior, my, yeah, you sister's cunt.  Yeah, yeah.  All these hilarious things they said would've been, ah, you sister's tootsies, boo.  Oh my god, can you imagine?  They would've wrecked it.  I want him gosh darn dead. 
[00:11:30]  What?  What?  Gosh darn.  We probably would've been talking about James Gandolfini today if it was on network TV.  That would've been canceled after fucking...  Oh, one season.  One season because the ratings weren't good enough for him.  Fuck network TV.  Yeah, I do have a little baby here in the picture.  Only a few months old, I believe.  Oh, boy.  Less than a year.  Fuck, man.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, this was depressing.  Yeah, this one was just fucking...  That's sad.  Yeah, everyone's got their little statements. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, everyone's got their statements.  Right.  From the cast.  All the fucking news people got their fucking two cents to throw in.  Stupid Mika.  Yeah, I saw nothing.  NBC.  Was he on TV?  Yeah, she actually said, I actually watched The Sopranos like no one else did.  Yeah, like we couldn't believe that you would.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was the biggest show on TV, dummy.  You should've watched it.  Of course.  If you're on TV and you do like pop, you know, news slash fucking pop culture, you should  watch everything. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, she knows nothing.  Oh, God.  I don't know why she's so hateable.  Gives a fuck.  She really is hateable.  We watch it for like a couple minutes before our show.  Yeah.  And every morning, she's just fucking hateable.  Can't stand her.  The sensible hairdo.  We should change to the new morning show on CNN with that big bitch.  Oh, it's a giant fucking woman.  She is huge.  She is giant.  The top, what is it? 
[00:13:00]  The top five Tony Soprano scenes there.  Yeah, I think.  Oh.  How long are these?  We got video of like three of them.  Ah.  Which ones do they list as the top five Tony Soprano scenes?  That's him with his mom right there on the stretcher.  Yeah, this one.  Oh, yeah.  That was great.  That was a good one in the hospital after his mom supposedly had a stroke.  And then the second best fight ever between Tony and Carmela.  And of course, the final scene.  Right.  Wait, the best fight. 
[00:13:30]  The final scene wasn't one of his best scenes.  But that fucking fight.  Probably the most memorable.  Is that the fight when, oh, they're really letting each other have it in season six, I think?  Well, she's a ridiculous actress, too.  Oh, is that a great one?  She's amazing.  Oh, this one, sure.  It's in the pool.  It's going to cost you $3.  Okay.  Oh, this is not what would be good.  You know what, Tony?  It's done is done.  We are where we are, and it's for the best. 
[00:14:00]  Just for the record, or it might even interest you to know that I might actually have gone  on with your cheating and your bullshit, if your attitude around here had been even the  least bit loving, cooperative, interested.  Whose idea was whitecaps?  Just a bigger version of an emerald ring, so you can keep on with your other life.  You don't know me at all. 
[00:14:30]  I know you better than anybody, Tony, even your friends, which is probably why you hate  me.  Hate you?  Well, don't worry.  I'm going to hell when I die.  Nice thing to say to a person heading into an MRI.  You know, Tony, I've always been sorry I said that. 
[00:15:00]  She annoys me.  You were my guy.  She's so good.  Yeah, it's not her.  She's so sweet.  Her short hair, dude.  Nobody can make me laugh like you.  Camilla, who the fuck did you think I was when you married me, huh?  You knew my father.  You grew up around Dickie Moltisanti and your Uncle Eddie. 
[00:15:30]  Where did you get off acting all surprised and miffed when there were women on the side?  You knew the deal.  Jesus.  And your mother can talk all she wants about what's-his-name in this fucking chain of drug  stores.  You and I both know that the other boyfriend you were debating marrying was,  Jerry Toofy, with his father's snowplow business.  And we now know that that wouldn't have suited you at all.  You really don't hear me, do you?  You think, for me, it's all about things.  No, no, no.  I forced all this shit on you. 
[00:16:00]  What you really crave was a little Hyundai and a simple gold heart on a chain.  You were so fucking hateful.  Can I tell you something, Tony?  Oh, boy.  Don't pretend like I got a choice.  Last year, I have been dreaming and fantasizing and in love with Furio.  Every morning when he'd come to pick you up, I would look forward to it all night long in 
[00:16:30]  bed next to you.  Oh.  Those nights when you were actually in the bed.  And he would ring the doorbell.  I felt like my heart would come out of my chest.  He would smile and we'd talk.  And then you would come down the stairs.  And I felt probably like someone who was terminally ill.  And somehow, they managed to forget it for a minute. 
[00:17:00]  And then it all comes back.  He talked to you all.  Poor you.  He made me feel like I mattered.  You know, you asked me here today, what Irene's cousin has that you don't have.  And I thought about it because it's a pretty good fucking question.  And yeah, she's sexy enough, even with the one pin gone.  But that's not it.  I could converse with her because she had something to say.  I am here.  I have things to say.  Besides bringing the fucking chairs down and then deciding to live in trust. 
[00:17:30]  She's a grown fucking woman who's been kicked around.  And she's been on her own.  And she's had to fight and struggle.  Unlike me, is that it?  Who the fuck wanted it like this?  Who the fuck pissed and molded just the idea of me with a fucking real estate like this?  Free to sit back for 20 fucking years.  And fiddle with the air conditioning.  And fucking bitch.  And complain.  And fucking bitch.  Bitch, bitch, bitch to me.  To your priest.  Fuck it. 
[00:18:00]  This is like a real argument, man.  Oh my God.  This is a real argument.  Yeah.  She's making valid points and he's just fucking angry.  Who knew all this time you wanted Tracy and Hepburn?  Well, Tony, what about the thousand other fucking pigs you had your dick in over the years?  The strippers, the cocktail waitresses.  Were you best friends with all of them, too?  You fucking hypocrite.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:18:30]  That's like, I feel like I'm a kid again.  Holy shit.  The spaghetti should hit the wall at this point.  Two amazing actors.  Holy fuck.  You are.  There wasn't one fucking part of that where you felt like you're watching a show.  Right, right.  It's like, oh, he didn't get that right or that line didn't seem sincere or something.  Wow.  That was perfect.  Her fucking face during that.  Wow.  That's every argument I've ever lost. 
[00:19:00]  Valid points and just scrambling for something.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  He's yelling, fuck it.  And she's hitting him with fucking devastating blows.  I wanted to fuck the ponytail guy that works for you.  Oof.  Oof.  This was a fucking really active show, man.  Amazing.  Not exactly a news flash, but...  No, no, but, yeah, it's...  A few people on Twitter, because you asked, I guess they were sightseeing in Italy, and he 
[00:19:30]  died in the hotel bathroom.  Okay, wow.  That's coming out a lot now.  I'm not sure if that's official or true.  I hope he didn't go out like Elvis.  Right, right.  I hope he didn't go out like Elvis on the old can.  So.  What was, uh...  The...  What he just, uh...  Oh, what the fuck did he...  Oh, what he just told...  When you watch how an actor plays stuff, like, when they were outside, right there, and you  can't see this, but this argument started in the pool area.  In the pool, yeah.  And he gets out, and he's got a cigar, and she goes, is that why you hate me?  And he's smiling. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he goes, hate you?  And he's smiling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, what a fucking...  I would never, of course, over-the-top shithead.  I would have been angry.  Hate you!  But that's why he was great.  He just...  Yeah, yeah.  You wouldn't even have gotten...  It's like, oh, that's why you hate me.  Hate you.  Right.  Hate you.  Instead of hate you.  And he's like...  He's smiling.  What?  That's how real people fucking argue.  Yes.  That's exactly how real people fight.  Yeah, that was...  Petey Falco.  I mean, we gotta acknowledge her as an actress. 
[00:20:30]  Fuck.  I think she was the best pure actor in the series.  It's sickening how good she was at that.  Yep.  When she's thrown...  Remember the fight they have in the...  Because fights are not...  They seem like they're really easy to do.  Just yell at each other.  But they're not easy like the way these guys did it.  The subtlety.  Oh!  You're looking at two people that are supposed to know each other intimately.  Every fucking thing about each other.  So when they fight, you know, they know each other very well.  So it makes the dynamic different.  And they pulled it off amazingly. 
[00:21:00]  And she wasn't afraid to look bad.  Like some actresses would want to, you know...  Well, I'll get you through my hair and my makeup.  She looked like utter shit right there.  Yeah.  Right.  She looked like she had been crying, upset, not taking care of herself very well.  And the little subtle faces.  The smirks.  Like Tony didn't even have to say anything, but he'd just smirk and give eyes like, really?  Right.  Fucking great.  And I was listening to a clip how Gandolfini was explaining how he got up for these type 
[00:21:30]  of fucking scenes.  And he said he would not sleep for two days to get really just ornery.  Or he would drink six cups of coffee because that would drive him fucking insane.  And sometimes, I don't know how true this one was, but he would put a rock in his shoe.  I heard that from actors.  Oh, really?  He would put a rock in his shoe.  You know how annoying that could fucking be.  God.  Just little tricks he did to kind of get up for some of these scenes.  It's a big, fat shoe.  Oh, oh.  I thought you said he'd put a rock in his shoe. 
[00:22:00]  Let me...  Oh, a rock.  Wow.  You've heard other actors say that about him or that they've done it, too?  He...  I guess in an interview, he said that stuff.  What a great trick.  Yeah.  I would just put on my angry face.  All right, remember, it's grr.  I'm angry.  I'm angry.  No dynamic to it.  You just play the whole scene at ten, angry.  You're just pointing up in the air.  Yes.  You didn't want that!  Take two, Jim.  All right, you didn't want that!  You know you're playing angry the next day, so you make sure you get a good night's sleep. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Not Gandolfini.  You know he's going to look like shit because he's been up for two days.  God, that son of a bitch was good, man.  Amazing.  It's really just...  It's just sad.  It's on all the TV.  I mean, it's just the big story.  I guess they've got Frank Vincent on the phone talking about it.  Yeah, we should...  Do we get him on?  Man's man's guide to a man being a man.  Is we're only getting some soprano angles on this one?  We can, yeah.  I mean, we should. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  I'm sure we could get Max.  Frank Vincent.  Max Cook.  Oh, my goodness.  You know, Max, what's he going to do now?  He's like, shit.  I was a bestseller, and Tom Popper came over and just told me, and I was actually, I saw,  you know, just with another comment, he's like, yeah, dude.  And it's really weird when you hear, like, a celebrity guy.  It is what it is, but this one really did feel like, oh.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, definitely.  It's a tribute to how well he fucking played that character.  Yeah.  You're just like, oh, I know that guy. 
[00:23:30]  I know that guy.  You know Tony Soprano, right?  Yeah, sure.  Right.  You know that guy?  You know all his little fucking foibles?  Everything.  And then, oh, he's dead.  Oh, shit.  Well, oh, but he was my friend, kind of.  Yeah.  I can't believe he was only 51.  No.  He always looked kind of middle-aged, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Because when he was doing The Sopranos, he was probably in his early 40s then, because  that show's like 10 years old now.  Yeah, all the 30s.  30s. 
[00:24:00]  Late 30s.  When did the shows hit?  99.  Yeah.  Oh, 99 even?  Fuck.  14 years, right?  That's almost, yeah, all right.  He's 14.  He's 14, 37.  Jesus.  He's in at 37.  He did a lot of shit for soldiers, too.  He really loved soldiers.  He did those Iraq specials on HBO.  Yeah.  He was the guy who really cared about soldiers.  Yeah, worked for Wounded Warrior.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He did his fucking good guys.  Okay.  Here's another one.  A little trick that Gandolfini did. 
[00:24:30]  Tom in New York City.  What's up, Tom?  Morning, guys.  Good morning, buddy.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Tom.  One of the seasons where they had the episode where he had food poisoning.  Yeah.  And he kind of got delirious and he was sick.  In order to prepare for that, he spent like two or three hours in a bucket of ice water.  Not just a bucket.  You know, one of those big ones that you get, you know, like when you have a pool party and  you get beer, fill it, you know what I'm talking about.  And he would just, he sat in this thing for like two or three hours until he was shivering 
[00:25:00]  cold, freezing, in order to play that opposite sick fever that he had.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So, but how long was he cold for after?  Because you think you'd warm up as soon as you're under the blankets.  Oh, no way, man.  You get that chill going.  It doesn't go away quickly.  He was probably doing it in between takes.  Oh, sure.  Can't you just remember how it was when you were sick?  Just be like, yeah, I remember being sick once.  All right, I'll do that.  That episode was fucking, it made you nauseous to watch it, how well he played it. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Laying on the floor like that, like, oh, he looks sick.  Artie comes in, tries to talk to him about the food, and it wasn't his food.  How great was that guy?  Artie Bucco was an underrated part of that show.  I can't remember when he had a shotgun on Tony.  He was going to shoot him.  He was going to shoot Tony.  Everybody's watching going, Artie, you're not going to do anything.  Put the gun down.  He was a simp.  What a zero.  He was a simp.  He was in love with Adriana. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, he was in love with a few beer, and then he was in love with that other one that was  ripping off the fucking place.  And then the other guy that worked for Tony was fucking her, and he kept talking like he  was all in love with her, trying to sweep her off her feet.  He was white knighting her.  Yeah, and one of the fucking low-level guys.  I think it was, what was it, one of the fucking Doogie Houser's friends or something.  Is that the one he got his hands stuck in the fucking hot oil at the end?  Oh, I think that was, right?  Was that him? 
[00:26:30]  I think so.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  Thank you for your phone call, sir.  Indeed.  Thank you, gentlemen.  All right.  You buco.  Oh, hey, look what I made for you today.  Oh, put the menus down.  I made something special for you.  Right in the middle of conversations, and he would come over and start talking about  some bullshit.  That moment.  Oh, what a terrible.  Dude, there's one moment where Gandolfini is telling him about what's wrong with his  right, and it's the episode about how annoying Artie is when people are eating.  And there's that one moment where there's a guy telling a joke to his girl and to the other 
[00:27:00]  couple, and that asshole walks.  It annoys me to this day.  As the guy gets to the punchline, he walks over and goes, oh, do you like the button  when I cut up myself?  He just starts telling a boring fool.  You're like, shut the fuck up.  Who cares?  God, they got it so right.  They really did.  I would love to know what James Gandolfini thought when he was like, okay, I got this mob series  that I'm doing, and the script for episode one is all about him being sad that the ducks 
[00:27:30]  are leaving.  Yeah, yeah.  How do you look at that and go, what is this fucking show about?  As an actor, he probably looked at it and went, this is fucking amazing.  Yeah.  It's nothing like I've ever read before.  That's why the show is so great.  Yeah.  It's good.  I just explained why The Sopranos was successful.  That's why people listen to this show.  That's to be enlightened.  That's right.  The Sopranos will be a hit.  Mark my words.  And now most people like the ending, too.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  I remember the outrage when it hit, but I kind of like it now, man.  Yeah.  And we won't be getting a movie or anything.  Yeah.  Wasn't there a talk?  There was talk about that for a while.  Who was going to be in it, though?  I mean, they're all dead.  Christopher's dead.  I mean, Sharipa's character died.  That's true.  It's like, what are you going to do?  Wasn't he going to be fucking, you know, Tony at Disney World?  They probably would have done a reboot.  Just make believe all that shit didn't happen.  Make a movie.  Started off from, like, the end of season four or something.  Whatever.  I don't know. 
[00:28:30]  Alternate timeline like Star Trek.  What happened?  You're lost.  Yeah.  Lost.  Right.  Yeah.  Gandolfini on Inside the Actor's Studio.  That was a really good interview, man.  That was really fucking good.  Have you ever seen an actor talk differently, like, as differently from his character as  Tony and Gandolfini did?  Oh, I know.  It really is weird.  In the early Sopranos, he didn't have the real heavy Tony voice.  Yeah.  He kind of grew into that.  But it was never what it is when he's just talking in an interview. 
[00:29:00]  You're like, what the fuck?  That is it.  It's always been strange.  Stop putting on that funny voice.  Right.  Who's this gentleman?  Yeah.  You got a clip?  Yeah.  Let's hear Tony as James Gandolfini.  He has created memorable port.  James Lipton. 
[00:29:30]  Looks like Tony Soprano there.  Easy, easy.  Tonight, we add to our sizable New Jersey contingent.  His words.  That includes Kevin Spacey, Meryl Streep, Ed Harris, Bruce Willis, Nathan Lane, Michael  Douglas, Susan Sarandon, Chris Reeve, Tom Cruise, John Cavalier.  Where were you born?  Westwood, New Jersey.  What are your parents' names? 
[00:30:00]  Santa and James.  And where were they born?  My father was born in Italy in a place called Borgotaro.  And then when he was two or three, he came here.  My mother was born in America.  So weird.  He pronounces his arms.  She was six months old.  And then came back when she was about 20.  And do you still have roots in Italy?  Are there?  Yeah.  I have a lot of cousins.  Oh, boy.  All that.  Oh, Jesus.  Enough about Italy.  There is a farm, isn't there, outside Milan?  Oh, boy.  Oh, man. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, we own some land of a mountain that my family has owned for a long time.  It's, um, basically there's a lot of snakes and things on it, but it's there.  And it's Italian.  It's land.  It is.  What language was spoken in your home?  Italian, but when they didn't want us to know what they were talking about.  So they didn't teach it to my sisters or myself.  And what sort of music was played in your home?  A lot of, like, um, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[00:31:00]  My father used to, um, he used to wear sandals with black socks and shorts.  And, uh, these boxer pants went up to here.  No shirt and a hat.  And would put the tarantel on and go out and cut the grass.  The speakers would be outside.  Holy shit.  Much to my mother's horror.  It was pretty good.  Many of our guests have expressed strong feelings about the effects of their roots on their lives and craft. 
[00:31:30]  For millions of people around the world, you've become quintessentially Italian.  Was that heritage emphasized in your home very strong?  Yes.  How so?  I didn't know anything else.  I mean, I...  I see.  So I can't really compare it.  I mean, you know, the big, uh, Thanksgiving dinners, the big Christmas dinners, Italian food, um...  What was your father's profession?  He was a bricklayer, a cement mason, and then he became the head, uh, custodian of a high school. 
[00:32:00]  And did your mother work?  Yes, she was the head lunch lady of a high school.  You had siblings, huh?  Two older sisters.  And their names?  Lita and Joanne.  Were you a well-behaved kid?  Up to a point.  What point?  High school.  Most of our guests encountered TV and movies when they were very young.  Did they play a role in your life?  Yeah, sure.  Yes.  Yes.  The Sopranos crew seems familiar with the Godfather dialogue. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  There are frequent quotations.  The generation before he was principally inspired by Brando.  Was De Niro of interest to you?  Sure.  Mean Streets is one of the things that I saw ten times, like in a row.  I just sat there.  I just thought it was great.  Everything about it.  That was the first movie that...  You just sit here and watch this all day.  Movies that affected me seem to have to...  We're just fucking...  Lipton is a great fucking interviewer, man. 
[00:33:00]  That's fascinating.  Oh, is he good?  Yeah.  And, I mean, he doesn't sound that different.  No, it's the R's and more of just a jollier tone in his voice.  Yeah.  And he's shy.  Yeah, yeah.  He comes off as a little...  Yeah, his body language says shy, right?  Yeah.  Man, that just sucks.  Yeah, it does.  A great loss for everybody.  A lot of big actors are shy.  Oh, yeah?  Are you shy?  Are you shy? 
[00:33:30]  No.  No.  But a lot of big actors are shy, and a lot of actors who stink aren't.  Hence my lack of shyness.  Oh, God.  We got someone on line three.  Chloe Paines.  Hi, who's this?  I fucking died.  Oh, no.  Is that what I fucking wanted?  I'm 51 fucking years old.  What, are you fucking kidding me?  I still had fucking work to do it on it.  Fucking shattered. 
[00:34:00]  And I'm glad I died in Rome.  It's kind of poetic if you look at it.  Jeez.  Wow.  Wow.  What happened?  Let me tell you something.  I'm a gluttonous son of a bitch.  But more than that, there might be other elements.  Things I can't talk about.  I know one thing, man.  I had to take an Ambien. 
[00:34:30]  I mean, look.  A lot of famous people die that you don't know.  Who are you?  Who the fuck is it?  It's Max.  I know.  I was just enjoying that James.  That was exactly what Gandolfini would have sounded like if you were.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck, man.  My heart's pounding there for a second.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Yeah, so how are you dealing with this?  I mean, it's going to be terrible.  No, I had a full emotional shutdown. 
[00:35:00]  Like, I denied all news.  You know, forgive me, because I just arose and I pounced on the chance to call you.  But I just couldn't believe it.  I was in total shock, and it really, really hurt, and it didn't make sense.  And, you know, all of a sudden, I started to think, I can't make any more Tony Soprano videos.  Oh, man.  Oh, now you've got to make them. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  See, I'm torn, though, fellas.  I mean, what do I do?  I mean, do I respectfully stop?  Or do I keep going and come off like some kind of opportunistic dick?  Well, people can look back at your YouTube and see you've been doing it.  Right.  I mean, uh...  Yeah.  You know.  It's an homage.  I would do it.  Right, an homage.  It's an homage.  But it is amazing.  You keep the character alive a little bit.  Like, what Max is saying is, and we all do this, we all think, how does it... 
[00:36:00]  Like, I'll tell you one of the first thoughts I had when I heard he was dead, is, fuck,  I should have come back that day and met him.  I wish I had...  Because he was here one day at three, and I was doing something legitimate for work.  But I remember going, like, I want to go back and meet him, but I think I couldn't.  And I was like, fuck, I was so mad.  Right.  And I go, God, I wish I would have come back and met him.  It's like, you automatically think of my little being affected by it.  Right.  It's such an unimportant thing.  I'm glad I never met you.  I've got to be honest. 
[00:36:30]  Everybody thinks I'm a four-loving guy.  I'm fucking not.  Leave me the fuck alone.  I'm miserable.  Oh, shit.  That's another thing that, again, I think he probably would have said exactly like that.  Exactly.  Look, I appreciate it very much.  But can you back the fuck away?  You're invaded my personal space.  I'm in no mood.  I mean, this was a guy, listen, this was a guy who gave us, you know,  the greatest performance ever.  I said to my wife last night, I'm like, Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 
[00:37:00]  made me want to become an actor.  Gandolfini, he made me stay an actor because I wanted to stop acting 4,000 times.  And every time I saw him go, I just said, nope, I've got to keep going.  Jack Nicholson in Cuckoo's Nest made me want to fuck an underage redhead.  I like your style.  So you took an Ambien last night, Max.  You're out of your mind, huh? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Have you guys ever taken one?  No.  No, no.  I've heard about him, though.  No.  Holy shit.  They say we have the same effect.  They help you sleep.  Yeah.  But it's one of those things where you're suddenly standing up in the corner of a room  like a horror movie.  No clue how you got there?  What's that?  No clue how you got there?  No clue how you got there.  You're standing there and you wake up.  I've done a little sleepwalking on it.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that shit's dangerous. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  It's fucking dangerous.  A lot of people are known to get in cars and drive and...  Yeah.  Or start cooking or whatever the fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, Nicolini did that once.  She started cooking and left the pan on the fucking stove and just started on fire.  And doesn't remember.  Not a clue.  That's where I remember that from.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember where I remember that was the one.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You know, environmentally, can I just say that it was all just apocalyptic around here  when the news came down that Gandolfini was dead. 
[00:38:30]  I have like a five-car intersection or five-lane intersection up at the corner, and there  were huge accidents there.  Streets were closed down.  There were sirens.  I'm out walking my dogs, and there's like some bald, shirtless, kind of crack-headed looking  kid from Texas.  Hey, excuse me, sir.  Hey, excuse me, sir.  And I'm like back away.  And the best thing you know, when I get up to my front door, he's passed out under the  call box with like a wet wetness on his crotch as if he pissed himself. 
[00:39:00]  And then there was some guy banging drums really, really loud, and cars were re-rendering  and ending each other.  Ambien!  Are you still on Ambien?  What?  What are we going to do without Gandolfini?  Panic.  What are you going to do?  You're going to fucking shit your ass down and shut the fuck up!  What the fuck?  You could do a bunch of videos as Kevin Finnerty. 
[00:39:30]  True.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  He did.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, yeah, he did one of those.  I don't remember.  Kevin Finnerty.  That's what I wound up watching last night, because I sat down, I had some wine, and I  went and joined the club, and I fell apart at the end.  What, are you kidding me?  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  Very emotional.  Yeah.  How disgusted with you is your wife? 
[00:40:00]  How tired of this is she?  Now all bets are off.  Yeah.  She understands that this is a really big blow.  His wife has had it.  It's like, I can't believe, again, everything's kind of blowing up on the YouTube, and, you  know, the things people are saying, well, it's up to you now.  It's up to me now.  Yeah, you've got to do a post-mortem.  Of course you do.  I think a lot of people will be seeing your YouTube videos in the coming days, because 
[00:40:30]  now they're going to be searching out all sorts of Gandolfini stuff.  Yeah.  You know?  I was only 51.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Doesn't make any fucking sense, huh?  I just had a little girl.  Now what?  I never wanted to be one of those deadbeat dads that's not around to take care of the  kids.  I got to tell you something.  This really fucking hurts.  I was having a good time, even though it was a bit of a crank. 
[00:41:00]  What did Brad Pitt say?  Is he all right?  Nah, he's really upset about your passing there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He's got a lot to be upset about.  Look at him with his zombie movies, his long blonde hair, this Adonis.  He's a good guy, though.  I got to say, I enjoy playing off of him.  Did a couple movies they got him in me.  He sounds just like fucking scary.  Yeah, I think you're still feeling that one. 
[00:41:30]  Wow.  Well, it's, what, four in the morning over there.  He's in the middle of his ambience sleep.  He's in Hollywood, for the people that don't know.  Max.  Yeah.  Oh.  Man.  Man is right.  What do you have to say about all the people that are really, really, really sad?  I don't know.  I feel really bad for him. 
[00:42:00]  Then again, I'm sort of floating around in these vapors here, and I don't know what's  going on yet.  I mean, I can't tell you there's life after death.  Because I don't know yet.  Give a man a minute.  It's not like you're boarding a cosmic train.  He's fucking ambien.  Well, did you see the light?  People talk about the light.  People talk about the light, don't they?  I saw AJ, I saw Meadow, I saw Carmela. 
[00:42:30]  I saw them young, and then as I started to ascend further up into the sky, they started  to get older.  And then I saw babies.  I didn't recognize them.  It's very weird.  And then, it's like that night at Holstens, when everything went black.  That's the thing.  I feel like Tony Soprano died when it all went black.  I'm one of those guys. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, he's back.  Max's back.  Oh, cool.  Max is back.  Wait, who are we talking to?  Max or Tony?  Oh, Max is back.  He goes in and out.  Max, did you like the ending of The Sopranos with Don't Stop Believing?  I did.  I did.  A lot of people say, well, no, it just means, you know, that's life, and it ended.  And it goes on, and you just can't see it anymore.  And I'm like, nah.  Black is black.  And there were so many signs, and it just feels better that way. 
[00:43:30]  It's kind of easier that way.  Sort of like, you've already mourned Tony Soprano, you know what I mean?  But there's a man behind that guy.  And it's Shugato Feedy.  I don't want to fucking be dead.  I want to watch my little girl grow up.  This sucks.  Jesus.  Let's not mention all the food I'm going to miss.  The food and the beverages and the lifestyle. 
[00:44:00]  I got very comfortable.  I got a lot of respect.  But I was tortured.  Come on.  You've got to be pretty fucked up to play a part like that.  Tony Soprano.  I believe it's on the phone.  It's amazing.  It sounds amazingly like I'm very, very creepy now.  It is creepy.  Now it's creepy.  What's even creepier is that we get a call from Gandolfini from the afterlife, and some ass keeps showing up. 
[00:44:30]  And taking the phone from him.  Okay, you've got to go.  Max, they don't want to hear you.  They don't want to hear me.  I know.  I know they do.  But you're very upset.  And you're on Ambien.  No, you're on Ambien.  Now you're going to go listen to his schizo talk.  You know what this is going to do? 
[00:45:00]  It's going to completely discredit my past appearance.  No, wrong.  Oh, my God.  We're loving this.  You can't lose your best.  At least you'll see Christopher when you're there.  Fucking A.T.  Welcome.  Get your fucking ass up here right fucking now.  And let's go for a fucking ride.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to miss him.  What about A.J.?  I mean, you think A.J. is going to be all right with your passing there, Tony?  I don't know. 
[00:45:30]  I'm going to be fine.  I want money.  I want money.  I've been saying that all day.  Just walking around my house.  I want money.  The eyes really wide.  I'm going to be fine.  It's not fair.  I knew he would die eventually, but not like this.  So now what?  I don't want to lose my bedroom.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Mike in Philly wants to ask Tony a question. 
[00:46:00]  Mike, what's up?  What's the guy's name again?  Max?  Yeah.  Max, don't ever talk in your real voice again.  You've got to video yourself immediately and go order a sandwich with everything on it and  it'll go viral within hours.  All right.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  You probably should make another video.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to, but I got to wait a little bit and let this die down.  I don't think so.  No.  Why would you let it die down?  I think you should turn on your camera right now while you're on Ambien.  I'm cashing in on it.  You know?  This is what I would do.  Take another Ambien immediately as you're setting up the camera.  Make the room extremely dark with one light.  Just one light.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you're just kind of fucking talking about your life and what happened.  That fucking would go viral immediately.  Or how about you're standing there and the light, the one light is shining on you like 
[00:47:00]  you're looking into the light and you don't want to go yet.  It's got to be very shadowy, this video.  So take the Ambien, get that camera set up and let's do this.  Yeah.  You're in a black room.  There's a fucking spotlight on you, like a small spotlight.  You're like looking into the light.  Or probably lit from behind.  So it's kind of a little mysterious.  He doesn't want to go into the light or something.  Yeah, he doesn't want to go.  With that voice of yours.  Because you do such a great impression of him. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  Even though I know you're just some guy from fucking L.A. who sounds like a guy who passed  away, it was still interesting to listen to.  Absolutely.  Well, I did write a script a couple weeks ago, which is really eerily about this.  So it makes it even more compounded now that it's all gone down.  What was the script about?  It's basically Carmela telling T he's got to go.  Well, because he's dead, that he's got to let go. 
[00:48:00]  Because he goes to the fridge and there's nothing in there for him.  He doesn't understand.  Carm, what the fuck?  You got to keep the meats on tap.  What's with the fucking yogurt?  No gabagool?  No gabagool!  No gabagool!  Yeah.  She says, you got to go.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  I live here. 
[00:48:30]  And she's like, no, you don't.  You don't live here anymore.  You got to go.  Where am I going?  What am I doing?  I'm fine.  I can take care of everything.  I've got it covered here.  I've made changes in life.  I can do it.  But you need to get out of here.  Okay.  What if I'm scared?  Well, it's going to be okay.  You're not going to go to hell.  I'm not going to tell the whole thing, but it's that. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Again, creepy.  You need to work on the Carmela voice.  Oh, I got another girl to play Carmela.  Oh, I know that.  Yeah, I would hope so.  She's really good.  She has blonde hair.  She's perfect.  Although I did like your Melfi.  That was pretty goddamn funny.  You did Melfi?  Yeah.  You know a lot of guys got really turned on by Melfi?  I would get secret emails like, hey, do you do that all the time?  Yeah, really?  Oh, god damn sick.  What the fuck's that about? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, if you see Melfi, I am the ugliest woman that ever walked up.  Yeah, who got turned on by her necrophiliacs?  Fuck.  Well, there's one video where I shake my ass and I do like a huge seductive dance for Tony.  And it's me sitting on a couch watching myself shake my own ass at me.  The lines blur often.  And I started to get all of these weird side emails through YouTube. 
[00:50:00]  Hey, Max.  You've never met me before, but my name is John Guggins.  Oh, creepy.  I really, really love when you do Melfi.  Do you think you can make more of those videos?  You could probably do like Melfi masturbating.  No.  That would be wonderful.  Jesus.  People are twisted.  No kidding.  Oh, the whole world's fucked, man.  I swear.  How do you guys stay so happy?  You're all miserable?  Yes. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, we're pretty miserable.  Oh, my God.  I didn't see you as Melfi.  This is creepy.  Hold on a second, Max.  We got to play a little bit of this.  We're going to start from there?  Is that fine?  Sam?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Go ahead.  Pretty weird me even being back here.  It was like a bad breakup between us last time.  Fucking stung.  I told you I was sorry.  It was an act of self-preservation.  I was protecting myself. 
[00:51:00]  I thought I was being manipulated by a sociopath.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Who the fuck is a sociopath?  This day and age?  You're very angry.  I did.  And you're still very hot.  A little scruffy around the chin, but you know I've always wanted to bang you.  Them legs, that ass.  Oof.  It's like an associate of mine always says, marron. 
[00:51:30]  Let's talk about you.  You said that you needed to see me.  You said it was urgent.  Oh, it's fucking urgent, all right.  It's, uh...  It's my daughter.  You fucking hit the Melfi thing perfectly.  Yeah, the hands.  That's so...  Something, uh...  She was so annoying.  She was, uh...  She was attacked.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  She was fucking raped the other night after work. 
[00:52:00]  And you want to know the fucking best part?  Number one, she's fucking colorblind, so she didn't get a look at the guy.  And number two, she's too fucking fearful of being politically incorrect.  I'm so sorry, Anthony.  It's horrifying that your daughter was raped.  Jesus.  More than you know.  I'm feeling fucking helpless.  I'm not used to that.  She's walking around with no answers as to who the fuck ripped her uninvited, and I gotta  sit here with this toxic fucking bloodlust.  Being raped is a devastating experience for a woman. 
[00:52:30]  Ah, what the fuck would you know about it?  I happen to know everything about it.  Oh, my God.  You was raped.  When?  It was a few years ago.  Not that I can get into details, but...  He was never brought to justice.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You know who he was?  I...  I...  Who was he? 
[00:53:00]  Who the fuck was he?  I can't...  I can't tell you.  The wig.  Wow.  Jesus, Max.  What the fuck?  I see why people wanted to fuck you.  What legs on, Max?  Oh, yeah.  And just to, like, drive it home, I wore women's panties underneath the skirt.  Ah.  No one's ever gonna see that, but if you feel like...  If you tuck all your junk in that sweet satin, you're feeling kind of ladylike.  You're preaching to the choir. 
[00:53:30]  Why didn't you shave your goatee?  That's what made it so creepy, but it works, obviously.  A little scruffy around the chin.  Melty.  Yeah.  What happens then is Tony goes out and kills her rapist.  Right, yeah.  Because no one ever got that satisfaction on the show, you know?  Nope.  But that's part of the beauty of the show, is as frustrating as it is that Tony wasn't able  to kill him, like, that's what life is like. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Like, they really knew how to leave you hanging.  Sometimes they did it, I think, because the storylines got weird, but in that case, they  could have easily had Tony kill her, and they didn't.  You don't get that satisfaction, which was part of the genius of that show.  And we would have loved that satisfaction.  Fuck, yes!  You would love that guy to have been killed.  Pretty fucking brave to not do that.  Yeah.  Max, wow.  Bowler hat on YouTube, if you want to see Max doing Tony Soprano and everybody else  from The Sopranos.  Unbelievable.  Very good, sir.  How's the ambient?  Hey, guys. 
[00:54:30]  I'm so glad I got to talk to you again.  I'm sorry I wasn't more prepared, but...  I'm a mess.  You're a mess.  I saw this one really hurts.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've been locked into the nuances of this dude for years and years and years.  And there's always all the Tony stuff that, like, no one ever sees, like, you know, birthday  messages or, like, you know, could you read me back something that I wrote to you as Tony  Soprano?  I don't do that stuff anymore.  But in the beginning... 
[00:55:00]  Really?  You would do that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Any favor anyone wanted.  Just the fact that they were giving me any kind of attention.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  And then I had to...  I mean, if it wasn't for Tony Soprano, I would have never learned how to get a rhinoceros  skin with the hate.  Hmm?  Oh, with the...  You mean a thick skin from all the shitty comments?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was the NBA talking again.  Anyway.  Fellas, I gotta say, you do a good job over there. 
[00:55:30]  I just hope everyone's getting along.  I hope those serious bathrooms are clean enough for you.  I hope at night you're going out, and you're having some beverages, and you go home to your  families, because that's all it's about.  It's also about watching horror movies.  What?  Horror movies?  Horror movies are good.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I like watching horror movies, because everyone's a fucking asshole in a horror movie.  You can cathodically watch them all fucking die in horrible, violent ways. 
[00:56:00]  So by the end, you're tired, you've seen a lot of death, a lot of blood, and you feel  pretty good.  You have to call us every day on Ambien.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  I don't usually take these drugs.  Don't think I'm some kind of drug at Ambien.  No.  No.  No.  Now I leave again?  Yeah.  You got to go. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  All right there, Max.  If you want to call us later, we'll certainly take your phone call if you want to call back.  All right.  If you've got other thoughts on this whole thing.  But it's Bowler Hat on YouTube.  Max Cook.  It's Cook, right?  Yeah.  Even though it looks like Koch.  Yeah.  That's because my dad was a cop who died before I was born.  So I didn't want to lose that last name as much as it sucks.  Oh, okay.  I'm the last Cook male.  So fuck it.  Keep that shit. 
[00:57:00]  A lot of death.  Yeah.  And we'll put the link to Max's YouTube channel on our Facebook page for everybody.  Max, thank you, brother.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  A salute.  All right.  A salute.  Oh, wow.  And they were just showing us some wounded warriors, like veterans.  Yeah, yeah.  He was on HBO.  It was really great, man.  Right.  All right.

[01:13:30]  Listen to some clips  And then what happened  He found his name  In one of the clips  Oh no  And said I gotta hear this  We're fucking idiots  Oh no  He's a  Blunder on his part  To click that link  Yeah  He got excited  Like holy fuck  I'm a fan of these guys  And they're obviously  A fan of mine  Yeah cause they're  Talking about me  Unfortunately  You were not talking  About him kindly  In the clip  That he listened to  Oh  And it was a long clip  Oh  I believe it was 
[01:14:00]  About an hour that day  Probably  A good hour beating  Yeah  Yeah  And he wasn't  By the way  Searching for himself  He was searching  For you guys  Uh huh  Just to have a laugh  And then got excited  Like holy fuck  They talked about me  This is amazing  I didn't know this  This is like a childhood  Dream come true  And then he had to  Hear us bash him  For an hour  That's about right  Yeah  Oh  And he was in here  Yesterday  He was up  Yeah yesterday afternoon  Uh huh  And you talked to him 
[01:14:30]  I did  I got to interview him  But how did that come about  I just had an interview  Scheduled with him  Oh okay  It's drunken uncle  Yeah  I don't even know  His real name  Bobby Moynihan  Bobby Moynihan  He's huge on SNL  He's been there a while now  He's a staple on SNL  He's going into his  Sixth season  On the show  Uh huh  And I guess the bit was  It was at one of those  Benefits right  It was at 12  There's a picture of him  And the garden  It was out of context  Was it the  Sandy Relief concert 
[01:15:00]  Yeah  Okay yeah  1212 concert  And he went up there  With uh who  Seth McFarlane  Yeah it was  I'm sorry  Seth Meyer  Yeah sorry  So Seth Meyer  And him uh  Did a drunken uncle  In front of a  Live audience  At Madison Square Garden  Yeah  On stage  And it bombed  It went over  Like a fucking  Strong breeze  See because it was  Sandy Relief  Yes  And we had to point out  How bad it was  He followed Kanye West  Who also  Completely took the crowd  Out of the show 
[01:15:30]  Kanye West  Stunk that night  I think that probably  Hurt these guys  But you know  Look it wasn't a great bit  And it might be a funny bit  On SNL  But in that particular  It didn't work  It's hard when you're  Scripted like that  To have to be married to it  Yeah  What did we say  We weren't that bad  No you were horrible  Yeah really  Really mean  Really  Very mean  Really  Yeah  Yes you were  It's always hard  When you're mean  To somebody who likes you  Yeah prove that we were mean  What are you talking about  Well  We're here a little bit  You liar  Billy Joe was on 
[01:16:00]  But the genius  That was SNL's  Drunk uncle  Anthony  Came on  Right after Kanye  Anthony  Wow  SNL should be embarrassed  That was it  Before the show  I'm like  Opie  Oh this is uncomfortable  Can I point out  That this is not even  Light hearted ribbing  No no  This is just terrible  Like Opie  Oh I feel really bad now  I am mad  Like what the fuck was that  I remember trying to  Call these guys off  And stop the bit  And they wouldn't 
[01:16:30]  Maybe I just keep playing  Some way  Oh this is so terrible  Yeah  And this guy  And he's a fan of ours  For real  Not the guy next to  Drunk uncle  Right  Drunk uncle himself  Is a huge  Opie and Anthony fan  Okay  Oh man  It was  It was  Our guys came to us  And said hey man  We got this bit  It's called Drunk uncle  The person would be fired  It's like what  That was in front of  Two billion people  Last night  Every so often  You had to remember  You had to remember  Every so often  It's like oh yeah  This is going out 
[01:17:00]  To the world  Every channel is showing it  Yeah  And it just makes me feel  Like you know what  You see how I try to  Chime in and just  Give facts  Yeah yeah sure  Come on guys  Every channel is showing it  Like let's  Yeah you're trying to move on  Yeah quit mucking up the works  Stick to the news here  Yes  He could be on SNL  Could do that  You know what  The person listening to  Our voices right now  You could be on SNL  They should  It turns out the guy  Yeah whoops  That last night  Maybe they should  He's one of Jimmy's bits 
[01:17:30]  Yeah that would be  The time for it  Yeah  Jesus  I don't watch SNL anymore  So what  Is that one of their  Benchmark characters  Because that was  I don't either  Terrible  I mean everyone was like  Holy fuck Kanye West  Is out of place  And his sound  Didn't sound right  Whatever  And then  Then he was led off the hook  By Drunk Uncle  Drunk Uncle  Oh good  Oh you found Drunk Uncle  Good news  Oh boy  Very good news  Alright  Who plays Drunk Uncle  Bobby I think his last name 
[01:18:00]  Is Moynihan  He's one of the  Oh no  He's the new chubby guy  On SNL  Ah the new fat guy  Oh  Horatio Sands  Body fascism  Oh my god  Body fascism  I didn't realize  I jumped in on it  A little bit  This is so bad  I wouldn't even care  But now knowing  He's a fan of ours  I feel bad  Big fan like from childhood  Now I care  I feel bad  When he was just  Dreaming of making it  Like and just fight it  He was like  Well at least I have  My favorite radio show  Opie and Anthony  Oh see I feel bad  That's all though 
[01:18:30]  We moved on I'm sure right  Yeah well I don't really  This break is just  I knew this was you guys  I remember I kind of  Like that bit  And then I'm hearing you guys  Bash it  And I'm like alright  I'm in a awkward position  You did not move on  You sure  Let's check the clip  Alright  Didn't he do one of  Jimmy's bits  I think he was doing  The  He did the first  Jimmy bit  Did he  Yeah the construction site  Yeah  Where they're talking  To the chicks  That are walking by  And they're talking  The Chipperson  Kind of bad joke guy  Oh yeah  Or bad line guy  Wasn't he doing  Pause  Remember we had 
[01:19:00]  Our suspicions  Oh no  Now we have the connection  We bashed him  Now we can't accuse him  Of ripping off  Jimmy  But we had suspicions  That this guy  Ripped off one of  Jimmy's bits  And we're like  Well that's crazy  We're you know  We're big headed  We're being big headed  That they would even  Be paying attention to us  But now it turns out  The guy  Is a fan of the show  So he may have heard  Jimmy doing his thing  And maybe kind of  Oh now he's being  Inspired by Jim Norton  He was inspired  This break started  As us  You know 
[01:19:30]  Seeing how nasty  We were to him  And now we're  Going to accuse him  Well in the end  We stick up for Jim Norton  Because I remember  How upset Jimmy was  Because one of his bits  Was absolutely on SNL  It was twisted  And a little different  And we were like  What the fuck  They gotta be listening  To us over there  Yeah I've had a couple  Of Chip Bits show up there  And it's very frustrating  And now it turns out  The guy is a fan  Of our show  So it wasn't as far  Fetched as we thought  At the time  From the Chipperson part  I thought Daniel Craig  Was doing the Chipperson part 
[01:20:00]  I think he was  Yeah  I think he was  The lead off guy  Yeah but he was  He was the main guy  Yeah  Okay  They've come to accept  Weak lines as okay  In SNL  Like really soft  It doesn't have to be  Dirty or all edgy  But it seems like  They've accepted  A lot of weaker lines  Than they should  Yeah  Like there's a funnier line  You could put there  Absolutely  I know it's live TV  And it's fucking  Once a week  And it's a lot of work  But some of it  I'm like  What are you guys doing  It's awful  Mmhmm  Very fair criticism 
[01:20:30]  By me at that point  Oh was it  And non-specific  Who knows who  You were talking about  Yeah they've come  Who's they  The powers that be  Have come to accept  Weak lines  Meaning I'm saying  That the actors  Probably have much  Better ideas  Oh is that it  Specifically Bobby Moynihan  Yeah  Okay  Really  Oh boy  Something special  Something special  And something tells me  We're not going to turn around  Like we did on the Sandler song  With this one  Imagine it's so hilarious  And we're like  Oh okay  Long attitude  No  We have blinders  On with Sandler 
[01:21:00]  It turned out  That song was alright  Yeah  Fair enough  Alright let's hear  The drunk uncle  Joining me now  Is the perfect symbol  Of the holiday family experience  Imagine him listening  I saw three drinks  Come sailing it  Into my mouth  And I spilled on my shirt  Merry Christmas everyone 
[01:21:30]  Alright give it up  For drunk uncle everybody  Hello  Is he trying to do  Party line  Tell us  Until you enjoy the holidays  It really kind of looks like  Oh you mean when I get to  Spend all my money  On crap that nobody wants  Hooray for me  I mean what happened man  Kids used to dress up  For Christmas  You know  Before we opened presents  We had to put on  Tuxedos and a cake  We had to do it  Nowadays  You can't even say 
[01:22:00]  Merry Christmas anymore  You know  You gotta say  Hey baby Jesus  Are you on Foursquare  You know  Is there  Is there a room  At the inn  With wifi  Pause  Were you telling me that  Or was the clip telling me that  That's the clip  Oh  Opie's now eating  Anthony's burying his hands  In his face  Yeah yeah  And I'm just pinching my shaft  I'm very  I'm very embarrassed  Anthony's humiliated  I don't  Oh god this is embarrassing  I wanna  I wanna hear what we said about it  That was Opie on the tape  Saying pause  Yeah  Cause we had some things to say 
[01:22:30]  We heard enough  Yeah apparently we were gonna say  Like what a terrible crowd  Yeah yeah  Unfair  Yeah  He knows he's bombing  Cause he's adding the you knows  Oh man  That's a guy going  Holy fuck this is not working  How did they think  I don't think you know  Is in the character  Look at Jimmy's face  He's covering up  It's painful right  This is in front of  Two billion people  Oh  It's  He's  Bombing  It's  Bombing  Yes  It's really uncomfortable right 
[01:23:00]  Yeah  You have that like  Uncomfortable feeling  But you don't blame the audience either  You're like  Yeah  The lighting's not cool  No the material's not there  It's terrible  Wow  Alright we're back  That was  This is now  All I'm doing is imagining him  Like searching this out  Or searching out an Opie and Anthony  Just a random bit  He wanted just a fun Opie and Anthony  And going like  Oh cool  They're talking about me  And this is worse than he ever could have expected  This is a terrible deconstruction of his bit 
[01:23:30]  Jim went out of his way  Yes  To say you cannot blame the audience  Right right right  Justin is like  Well the audience really wasn't there  And then Jim's like  Yeah yeah  You can't blame the audience  It's the material  It was bad  I'll say that now  It wasn't a particularly  It was a weird thing  Like it just  It wasn't meant for Madison Square  No no it wasn't  No no no  Because it's a bit that you're too married to the diet 
[01:24:00]  Like on a stage like that  In that type of atmosphere  I think you have to have a little more flexibility  In what you're doing  You have to be able to  SNL never breaks the wall  And I think in a bit like this  You might have had to break the wall  And go this is really bobbing  Yeah  It might have been funny if he had dressed it like that  Like this is going nowhere  Maybe yeah  Let's hear some more  I'm sure we'd be  It's almost over  I would much rather have just heard Seth  Talking about something 
[01:24:30]  Funny or not funny  I would have still been interested to hear it  Let's uh  Maybe it gets better  Maybe it gets better  I like Seth  Is there  Is there a room at the inn with wifi?  Netflix me  Netflix me  Netflix me  You know what kids need to put in their Netflix queue?  An honest day's work  Alright Drone Goggle  Now  Were you affected at all by Hurricane Sandy?  I mean 
[01:25:00]  My ex-wife was named Sandy  She broke her hip last week  Is she going to be okay?  I hope not  Oh no come on Drone Goggle  Every marriage ends in tears  Burf  I mean kids  Kids don't even give thanks anymore Seth  They just give each other Pokemons and HPV  Oh Drone Goggle  That's not nice  Speaking of HPV  I saw Pearl Jam backstage  That was a nice group of ladies  Jeremy spoke in class today 
[01:25:30]  Oh that's good Drone Goggle  Yeah I mean the way things are going in this country  Jeremy's going to be speaking Chinese  Oh right Drone Goggle  I think you're a little too drunk  Oh  I'm not too drunk  So I wasn't prom king  Okay  So I wasn't  The NBA dream team  Okay  No yeah  So I'm not 
[01:26:00]  JC West  Okay  So I'm not  Too fast too furious  Tokyo draft  Okay  Come on  That's not me  That's not anyone  Alright  All joking aside  Here's what you viewers at home need to do  I want you to make a sex tape  Okay  And send it to Sir Paul McCartney  No don't do that  Care of England  Nope  P.O. Box England  Don't do that  New York 
[01:26:30]  1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-6-9  That's not his address  Merry Christmas everyone  Merry Christmas everybody  Enjoy the rest of this show  Drone Goggle everybody  Oh  One minute left  You got Jake  Jake Gyllenhaal looking like a fucking homeless guy.  It bombed worse than I remember.  That, yes.  Really bad, right?  That was horrible.  Oh, my God. 
[01:27:00]  All kidding aside, hey, drunk uncle, how about you start with a little kidding?  Yeah.  Wow.  Did that bomb.  I love that it just made everyone uncomfortable.  Wow.  Made everyone uncomfortable in the room.  Yes.  I see it out there in Radio Land.  People are tweeting.  Could you pause this?  Oh, my God.  Could you pause this for a second?  We're back live.  We're back live for this incarnation.  Yep.  Aren't we just doing it over again?  Aren't we just playing?  Just playing it again.  And listening to how bad it really was? 
[01:27:30]  Well, this is the clip that he had.  I know.  He searched out and listened to it.  Yeah.  And now he'll be like, oh, okay, I talked about it.  I addressed it with Sam.  Right.  And told Sam what big fan I am.  And then now we're just doing it all over again because we're all sitting here listening  to the replay of the replay.  Cringing.  Yeah.  It really did bomb very badly.  Let's see how we wrapped it up that day.  Okay.  All right.  This is about six months ago. 
[01:28:00]  And the lines weren't good.  That's the problem.  The lighting was horrible.  Did he just make that up, you think, on the spot?  No, no, no.  It looked like he was reading the teleprompter at one point.  He might have went off book a little bit, but it looked fairly, you know, or maybe he  had a cue card.  I don't know how SNL does it, but ooh.  The weird thing about SNL is they feel like if they can get a character on television  multiple times, it's like this cultural thing that people would get.  Like it used to be.  Ah, right.  Yes, yes.  But it's not.  Roseanne, Rosanna Dan.  Exactly.  But it made you laugh back then. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, the material was there.  The writing was there.  That's a horrible character, and the writing stinks.  We're back live here.  It's the day James Gandolfini died, just in case you're wondering what I mean.  Well, I just want to hear how bad it was that day.  Well, you really brought it home, didn't you?  I don't remember.  Yeah, but you didn't leave any room for interpretation.  No, no.  That's a terrible character, and the writing stinks.  That's the one that was the nail in his coffin.  He's like, well, it was a rough set.  It wasn't very good.  Oof. 
[01:29:00]  But you just kind of summed it all up.  You're going out of your way to not only say that it was the wrong place and the wrong  time for that character.  You're saying the character is terrible, and you said earlier in the clip, if somebody pitched  you to this character just for this dumb radio show, you would be fired.  I acknowledge it's a dumb radio show, and can I defend myself?  Sure.  This was before I knew that he was a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  That's what makes it worse.  We would have been open and honest. 
[01:29:30]  That was your gut feeling.  We would have smoothed out the edges a little bit that day.  Did you realize you only heard a murmur from the audience the whole time?  It never changed the dynamic of the audience.  You never heard...  There was a little bit of a gain when he mentioned Pearl Jam.  Right.  And McCartney, yeah.  Yeah, McCartney.  The rest was just...  Like people were talking amongst themselves.  They gave up on even paying attention.  Oh, yeah.  See, we're just cashing it again.  Because there wasn't even boos.  They weren't even annoyed enough to boo.  They just said, ah, fuck it. 
[01:30:00]  Let's go get a beer.  Well, I'll say, they probably wouldn't boo at a charity event like that.  Like, they might, but...  Oh, they would.  Madison Square Garden in New York City?  Come on.  Let's...  I want to hear how this clip...  Yeah.  We have less than a minute left from that day.  Oh, my God.  Six months ago.  Lorne Michaels should be ashamed today.  Okay.  Okay.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Right when we kick back in, Opie comes up with another fucking cruise missile.  But see, the anger that day is because of you, Jimmy. 
[01:30:30]  Because I know where this all started.  Yeah.  So I wasn't going to fucking, you know, sit back on this one.  Wow.  Because Jimmy, I saw it in his face.  The frustration that he's...  He felt like SNL was kind of ripping him off a little bit.  Yeah, not on that one.  Or taken from him.  No, I know, but I know it was this guy, you know, in another skit.  So this is where the venom's coming from, because I know how frustrated you were. 
[01:31:00]  You come up with this very original character, and next thing you know, it's sort of on SNL  in a slightly different way.  Fuck yeah.  And the writing stinks.  Lorne Michaels should be ashamed today.  Probably is.  Well, he wrote...  He signed off on that, I'm sure.  You know, they probably went to him and said, look, you got a few minutes on this, you know,  this concert.  What do you want to do?  Yeah.  And he had to be the one who said, let's do the Drunk Uncle thing.  Seth, do Drunk Uncle.  No.  Okay. 
[01:31:30]  You think even Seth Meyers was like, oh, God.  They must have known, like, when they started, like, oh, boy, this isn't going well.  Sure.  He just kept calling him Drunk Uncle.  Yeah.  Oh, Drunk Uncle.  Oh, Drunk Uncle.  Anything to have more Seth words and less Drunk Uncle words.  Like, oh, Chip, or oh, Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul would have been a great addition to this.  Oh, really?  Yes.  It would have bombed, but at least it would have made this radio audience enjoy it.  That guy's on SNL, and we would never have him on this show.  I would never have him on that show. 
[01:32:00]  Holy shit.  And if you just tune it, ah, you gotta listen to the replay, because.  Oh, is that brutal.  That was the worst thing that could have been said.  Dude, it's one gem after another.  I have to say, Opie was the most ruthless during this.  It was so mean.  This little deconstruction.  I was sticking up for, I know where I was that day.  Wow. 
[01:32:30]  I was sticking up for our pal, Jim Norton.  Thank you.  I was very fucking mad, because it was like two or three weeks in a row where we're like,  what is SNL doing?  They're biting off Jimmy a little bit.  And then you say that on your radio show, and everyone's like, ah, shut the fuck up.  Who, like the SNL guys are listening to you.  But then we have the connection.  The guy turns out to be a huge fan of our show from back in the day.  This guy thinks that you're very talented, Opie.  Oh, my goodness.  And you said Lorne Michaels should be ashamed, and that you would never have him on the show.  I love that.  I gotta hear that line again. 
[01:33:00]  Every line gets worse.  Because it's...  It's so bad.  Just when you think it's gonna wrap up painlessly, the last 20 seconds are fucking atomic bombs.  Oh, God, that's so bad.  Can you imagine going through YouTube?  No one of the guy knows us, or whatever, likes what we do.  It makes it so much fun.  Imagine looking for, like, a funny clip.  Like, you just want to laugh.  Right.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh, my favorite radio show brought my name up.  Love this.  And then you click on it, and your favorite radio show is advocating for you to lose your job. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  Says that they would never have you on as a guest.  No.  Not funny, not entertaining.  Right.  Just...  Oh, wow.  This is bad.  For Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul would have been a great addition to this.  Oh, really?  Yes.  It would have bombed, but at least it would have made this radio audience enjoy it.  That guy's on SNL, and we would never have him on this show.  No.  I would never have that guy on.  Wow, that was really uncomfortable. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  It's not good.  Oh.  That's it.  That's the end of the clip.  Wow.  So that's Bobby Moynihan.  Yeah.  And if you're just tuning in, listen to the replay, please.  But basically, we found out that he's a huge fan, Sam Usain, of our show.  Sam did an interview with him.  And to his credit...  You know, we're about to play that audio.  It gets better now.  Before the interview started, I was introduced to him.  He was like, Sam Roberts, this will be on the Opie and Anthony channel.  And then he immediately said he was a big fan, and immediately said, you know, those 
[01:34:30]  guys, I found a clip of them on YouTube.  They didn't like my...  12, 12, 12, 12 performance.  That, like, stuck in his head the most out of anything.  Sure.  All the going to our appearances or whatever, liking the show, listening, those moments where  you knew where you were when you heard a certain bit and things like that, all went away.  And he just remembers that.  Well, he has to know that that didn't do well.  Like, as a performer, especially a guy like that who does live TV. 
[01:35:00]  Jimmy.  Not even shit on him.  There's a difference between knowing you didn't do well and listening to people that you've  admired over the years, taking drunny diarrhea shits on everything you hold dear.  Yeah, but in all honesty, he had to know in that moment.  Like, I would love to ask him in that moment, how long into that did you realize we are  in trouble?  Uh-oh.  Like, was it the first line, or is there something you'd...  Because, like, as a stand-up, I'll do a bit.  And I'm surprised if whatever line I've chosen is the opening line doesn't work, because it's 
[01:35:30]  usually the line I think is strong.  So then I'll go into the second line, and when that doesn't work, sometimes you'll even  jump ahead and pull out something that you know is a fucking punch.  And when that doesn't work, you're like, sink-a-roo.  You're in trouble.  I'm in Dutch.  And I'm wondering with him...  When that moment was where...  Uh-oh.  Was it after the opening song?  Or was it one line in?  Where you just don't hear anything in reaction?  I think he talks about it in the clip.  Oh, good. 
[01:36:00]  But why wouldn't you just acknowledge...  I don't understand that.  You're bombing so badly, why would you just continue and try to get to the end of the  bit?  Wouldn't you just say, you know, just blow up your spot?  Well, was he a stand-up or just a sketch guy?  He was not a stand-up.  See, a lot of times sketch guys are very...  What makes them good is also what dooms them, is that they are married in that moment to  the scene, and it's also why they do scenes well when they go well, because they don't  break them.  Right.  It's only...  Yeah, he only ever did sketch and improv.  Yeah.  All right.  So...  Yesterday he came in, and Sam interviewed him. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Must have been comfortable.  That's when we learned that he was a fan of ours.  And I intended to kind of just ask him how that night went.  Uh-huh.  I had no idea that it was going to be in this context.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So here's the audio from yesterday.  Brand new audio.  With Bobby Moynihan, who plays Drunk Uncle.  Thing.  But I didn't know that you were a giant Opie and Anthony guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've been listening for years.  And we were talking, and you've heard their take on Drunk Uncle at the 12-12-12. 
[01:37:00]  I think I found it on YouTube.  I was just looking up Opie and Anthony stuff.  I can't do this.  Did you hear the part where you said he's been listening for years?  Years.  Yeah.  Well, like I said earlier, we hear that a lot from celebrities, and then you realize  they're just saying that.  I can always...  They're just saying that.  It sounds like he's not...  He's 100% telling the truth.  Yeah, yeah.  Looking up Opie and Anthony stuff, and saw my name.  For your pleasure.  Like, you're like, ah, I just like to laugh. 
[01:37:30]  Well, I just got serious again.  I hadn't had it for a while, and then...  Can you pause?  Can I tell you what I hate about Sam in this fucking interview?  Sam knows that he's not guilty in this clip of anything.  So he can pretty much just cheerlead and go, so what happened on the clip with Opie and Anthony?  Because he knows he didn't say anything.  That's the beauty of Sam, though, man.  Troublemaker.  He's not going to hide.  I love it.  No way.  That's what I like about Sam.  He doesn't hide.  Why would he hide?  He didn't say anything.  No.  No, but he's...  I don't hide when I point out other people's murders. 
[01:38:00]  If you raped somebody, I'd be happy to talk about it.  You're like, ah, I just like to laugh.  Well, I just got serious again.  I hadn't had it for a while.  And then started listening again and got back into it, and then was looking up stuff on YouTube  and saw my name and was mortified.  I was like, oh, no.  What have I done?  But they were talking about that I did the 1212 concert as Drunk Uncle.  Yeah.  And it did not go very well.  What's it like to go up there?  What's it like to bomb at Madison Square Garden?  Oh, it's the best.  Did you know that was going to happen, though? 
[01:38:30]  The second I walked in the door, I knew it might not have been the best idea.  So you're in the Drunk Uncle outfit.  Standing in the Drunk Uncle outfit.  Chelsea Clinton is standing there.  You look like an idiot.  Every single rock god is in a room, and you have makeup on, and you're holding a fake drink.  It was a wonderful thing to be a part of.  Of course.  But the lasting scar will last forever.  Yeah, I found a video where they were bashing me.  Opie and Anthony were bashing the performance, and rightfully so.  You found that.  I completely agree with everything they said. 
[01:39:00]  But that was a rough night.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he seems like a good dude.  That really, but again, he knows, you have to know.  That's interesting.  Stan has to show the humiliation of knowing you have to go out.  Like, that's fucking, oh, my God, I don't belong here.  I cut the clip down just for our purposes, but he also, I mean, he went on to talk about  how the teleprompter just kept going and going, and he just wanted it to end.  He was watching everybody just stand up and go to the bathroom, and he said it was horrible. 
[01:39:30]  That's brutal, man.  Did he talk about, and this is what I'd love to ask him, the moment you finished and walked  backstage, like, who did you see, and what were the, because walking backstage after a  shit performance, you probably wouldn't make eye contact with anyone.  People just don't look at you, or you look down.  Well, they'll say, hey, good job, it's great, man, great job, or I'm wondering what people  said to him.  Did everybody ignore him?  Did he get a picture with McCartney, or was he too ashamed?  Like the scene in Private Parts where Fartman walks back and Ozzy goes, what a fucking asshole. 
[01:40:00]  Fucking asshole.  I don't remember that.  Yeah, that was funny.  Ozzy was in that?  Mm-hmm.  Fuck.  That was the shy Howard that comes back.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Hi.  You're fucking asshole.  I bet you Drunk Uncle had the same experience.  I'm sure he did.  Very similar to that.  And he told me off the air, he described it in more detail off the air. 
[01:40:30]  I believe he said he was listening to you guys and wanted to tear his heart out of his  chest.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  We got to get him on now.  Oh, we do.  We do.  Now we have to get him on.  Even though we said we would never have him on.  No, you said that.  Oh, okay.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  Well, now there's a connection there.  We got to have him on.  Oh, yeah.  And I told him the secret.  I was like, you know, those guys will never talk badly about you again. 
[01:41:00]  And if you go on and you say, I heard when you made fun of me, you were right, it's  the last time they'll ever say a bad word about you.  That's right.  So I think we're trying to get him from next week or something.  I wouldn't beat him up if he came in.  No, fuck away.  No.  No.  Not with everything we've learned here today.  He's a talented guy.  I know what I'd probably say.  Sure.  Looks like you sobered up.  Fucking place will go nuts.  When?  After that. 
[01:41:30]  A little later.  I have to add.  Oh.  Well, you know.  Well, I'm officially now on his side.  I'm in his camp.  I'm a fan.  You like the drunk uncle.  I'm a fan.  Yeah.  If they like us, we like them.  It's as easy as that.  And it's not like he's successful or anything.  He's got SNL, but then he's also one of the main voices in the new Monsters, Inc. movie.  Is he really?  Yeah.  He probably is successful.  Well, you know what?  I saw the drunk uncle sketch in context on the Weekend Update on the show. 
[01:42:00]  And really, it wasn't that.  Way to smooth things over.  What are you doing?  You sound like your parents making up right now in 1972.  It works under the context of, oh my God, is he Guy Fieri?  And he does a great Guy Fieri.  Oh, let's hear his guy.  You know what?  I want to see that.  Let's try to turn this whole fucking thing around today.  If he does a great Guy Fieri and he makes fun of that whole rock and roll shit like we do,  then we're all in with him. 
[01:42:30]  Maybe we just got to embrace a different character.  Maybe.  And see it like Anthony said, in the proper context.  All right.  We're doing this cold.  I've never heard his Guy Fieri.  So this could go really bad.  That's a commercial that they can't load for 20 seconds.  I can't load.  Even when they can't load the commercial, you still have to sit here and wait.  He's got the flame shirt, the spiky blonde hair.  He does have that very deep voice.  And I guess he acts like Guy Fieri. 
[01:43:00]  That's exactly right.  Which is rock and roll.  Tomorrow the New York Giants take on the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.  Back this week.  All right.  Here with some ideas on what to serve at your Super Bowl party is the Food Network's Guy Fieri.  Fieri.  He's got the sunglasses in the back.  Seth Meyers cutting wires using pliers. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  It all rhymes.  It rhymes.  Guy, I'm excited for these recipes.  Are you ready?  I was born crazy.  Full throttle.  Now, one of my favorite parts of any Super Bowl party is the fingerball foot food.  Oh, I think you mean football finger food.  Nope.  I got it backwards on purpose, much like my sunglasses.  Protect your neck.  Nice. 
[01:44:00]  That's right.  Yeah.  The key to Super Bowl food is having a theme.  So what better way to get ready for the Giants versus the Pats than with a giant pat of butter.  Coming up at 9 o'clock, Elijah Wood.  Elijah Wood?  Yes.  Yes.  I think Ricky Gervais is coming in today.  We think at 10 o'clock.  That's right.  Stay there.  I have an announcement.  Can I do an announcement?  Oh, sure.  It's a very special announcement.  Sure.  We'll get back to that in a second. 
[01:44:30]  Anti-social comedy tour is sold out.  Oh, good.  Amy, Artie, myself, and David Tal will be doing a second show July 20th.  Nice.  I saw Amy last night.  She's looking rather lovely.  Shua.  We have a billboard outside of Lincoln Tunnel.  I know.  You said that when you was in.  Nice.  It's terrific.  I haven't driven by it yet.  That's amazing.  July 20th, 10 p.m. show has been added.  This one will probably sell out at the Sands in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  So, please come.  And when we get back, maybe I could talk about my big acting thing last night. 
[01:45:00]  Ah.  Jimmy got to act with an A-lister.  Don't say anything.  For real.  Oh, boy.  I want to guess.  For real.  I want to guess.  And so did he.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Elijah Wood on the way.  And, oh.  The Opie and Anthony podcast.  The brand new episode is up there.  People are loving the 8-track porn bit that we put on this week's podcast.  Oh, yeah.  Doesn't that feature Patrice O'Neal? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  It does.  So, you get to hear some Patrice O'Neal, too, man.  Just killing it when we went over the 8-track porn.  I haven't heard that in so long, man.  Yeah.  That and Liberace's ex-lover, Scott Thorson, with his lies.  You all bought it hook, line, and sinker.  We did.  Oh, I know.  We did.  We did.  I had a couple little suspicions, but then later that day, I had a lot of suspicions  about what he was saying.  Scott.  Scott, do I make you happy?  Oof.  Would you come into my mouth?  Eh, let's make out. 
[01:46:00]  Looks like someone's up there.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  My morning breath.  Let me put that in my mouth with my morning breath.  Jesus.  I'll suck over my own morning breath.  Big and unclipped and lumpy.  Ha, ha.  It was lumpy.  Fucking silicone cock.  Yeah.  Lumpy prick.  It's a great name for someone.  Lumpy prick.  Yeah.  Lumpy pricks.  P-R-I-X.  We'll be here Tuesday.  All right.  Why didn't I just let you go to break?  Now I'm bombing.  And the Opie and Anthony nugget, of course. 
[01:46:30]  This week, it's butt plug.  So go get the latest podcast.  Opie and Anthony.  The podcast is a brand new episode every Wednesday.  Yeah.  When are we going to play the Guy Fieri impression?  We were...  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm easy. 
[01:47:00]  I'm easy like Sunday morning.  Lionel Richie.  That's why I'm easy.  I'm easy like Sunday morning.  Oh, man.  It's his birthday.  How old is old Clay?  64.  What?  Wow.  Jimmy knows this shit. 
[01:47:30]  That's pretty good, Jimmy.  That was a guess.  Well, you guessed right, sir.  I'll take a guess.  Danny Aiello, who I just saw at Colin Quinn's one-man show.  Ah.  What, a couple weeks ago at this point?  Yep.  Aiello.  And I saw him walk out of the theater, and I'm like,  God damn, does Danny Aiello look good.  He's 31.  He's 31 years old today.  Is this a typo before I say what I'm going to say?  It says he's 80.  Wow.  Is that possible?  It is possible.  No. 
[01:48:00]  Then again, it's possible he could be 150.  No, I think that's got...  I would bet we're off 10 years.  He's 80 years old.  I just saw him.  He didn't look 80.  He looked good?  No.  Are you positive?  Yeah.  He's always looked 80.  Yeah, that's true.  No.  He's never looked young.  No.  Danny Aiello.  He looks like fucking Dominic Barber there.  Yeah.  He looked great.  He was at Colin's show laughing his fucking ass off.  Yeah.  And Colin, good news, they're going to continue with the show, right? 
[01:48:30]  He wasn't sure where it was going a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  I saw Colin last night.  Is it moving uptown a little bit?  I want to say the Jubilee, the Cherry Jubilee.  Peter.  Did you say Jew?  There's a one-man show about the Constitution.  I mean...  Yeah, ho-hum.  It's really...  It's fucking brilliant.  It's brilliant.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Very topical, too, in this day and age.  Yes.  Many people don't know their rights. 
[01:49:00]  I can't get enough of the Ben Stein clip to this day.  I know.  Every time I see him on TV...  Oh, I always think whenever I see him now, I hold a grudge.  He's just a dirt guy.  Because he's an asshole.  He's a douche.  Well, it sounded like...  But what you meant to say, what you meant by that was to Jew down.  That's right.  Shut up.  Oh, Chip.  My mother always said that.  Be careful, Chip, but a Jewy Kikeburger's will take all your money.  Jesus, Chip. 
[01:49:30]  Come on, man.  She told me that.  She goes, if you ever want to see how many Jewy Kikeburgers are somewhere, roll a penny,  they run out for it, Chip.  That's very offensive.  And it's stereotypical.  And there's no reason for that type of language.  She was helpful.  She's a marvelous woman.  No, you're terrible.  And she raised an awful, awful child.  It's so funny when I talk to Jonathan, my manager, because Chip is just so racist, and  he fucking...  But Chip's not hatefully racist.  He's just...  He's just stupid.  He's repeating what his dumb, fucking, fat, cankled mother said to him as he fuck black  guys in the room. 
[01:50:00]  And he'll just say that to Jonathan.  Jonathan's very funny with Chip.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You saw when Chip scared Jonathan at the Tonight Show dressing room?  No.  Did you see that one?  I think I saw that one.  Oh, you never saw that one where fucking John...  Which features Jonathan Branstein?  I don't think so.  But that's how he...  That's how he...  Oh, I did see it.  Yes.  It was very funny.  That's how he interacts.  Yes.  Jonathan's very funny with...  Yeah.  It's patience and...  You gotta be patient with Chipper.  Yeah.  That's open. 
[01:50:30]  That's not the one stupid cocksucker.  That's a good one from last night.  Shut up.  Yesterday.  Yeah.  He wants to know if he went to Ben Stein Club.  Eh.  Next time we bring it up.  We bring it up a lot.  At some point.  Because we gotta talk about E-Rock's Goldfish.  This is great.  Now, E-Rock, now you gotta love Sean F.  Oh, I don't.  Why?  Of course, Sean F is the guy that makes the E-Rock songs.  We're waiting for another creation. 
[01:51:00]  Can we play the latest one?  Do we have to?  Yes.  I do like that one.  The latest.  This one.  Yeah, this is the one he came up with a couple weeks ago.  It's called Big Fat Guy.  Right.  Wow.  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  His titties are big and round.  Slobo.  You rarely see him moving.  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  He's never gonna lose a pound.  He's so mad.  He's so mad. 
[01:51:30]  Slobo.  You rarely see him moving.  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  His titties are big and round.  Slobo.  Slobo.  You rarely see him moving.  You rarely see him moving.  He's never gonna lose a pound.  Slobo.  Slobo.  Slobo.  You rarely see him moving.  Slobo.  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  His titties are big and round.  Slobo.  You rarely see him moving. 
[01:52:00]  Slobo.  Sex Bagel is a big fat guy.  The reason why I love the song so much  Because Sean F's like a fun-loving guy  And he has passion  Expand your palate  Oh, which one is that?  Oh, that's the one that leads to what happened today  Yes, of course  It's a big hit  But he sells it  Oh, he does  He's just jovial and happy to be singing about Iraq  He's not singing lackluster  He works for it  And Iraq gets so mad  So angry  Poor Iraq 
[01:52:30]  And you're still mad even though he sent you goldfish today?  Why would I enjoy this?  Oh  Why?  Because it says right on the box  Enjoy some goldfish  You don't enjoy that he went out of his way to get you personalized goldfish?  No, he's a psychopath  Did anyone tweet the goldfish yet?  No, we got him yesterday and I wanted you guys to be the first to see them  It's wonderful  I didn't even know you could do this  But you go on the goldfish site  Oh boy  This is plugola, man, right here 
[01:53:00]  This is payola shit, okay?  Oh boy  Oh no  Make sure the goldfish people know  Because a whole bunch of people are going to do this now  You go to the goldfish site  And then you can get like a picture of your kid  Or in this case, E-Rock  On the goldfish package  Uh-huh  And they actually used a photo of E-Rock  While he was drunk on tequila  Oh, right  Yeah, that's a great one  And it says  Enjoy some goldfish, E-Rock  This looks like it's like a real product  Yeah  And then on the back it says  Enjoy some goldfish, E-Rock  Thank you for making snacks a hit  Enjoy some goldfish 
[01:53:30]  But stay away from the shotgun cake  Sean F  Mmm  You know what those two guys  You're not appreciative, man  Of anything, E-Rock  Yeah  I'm so appreciative of all this bullshit  Watching the show yesterday  Yeah  They saw E-Rock walk out of the studio over there  Down the hall  Yeah  And they were like  You know, he's not as fat as everyone said  That's why I love this thing  He goes, he's not even really that fat  I go, I know  Who said this?  I know  The two chubby guys  The two guys that were watching the show from outside yesterday 
[01:54:00]  Oh  But I've heard that a lot from people that don't know you and the show  They know the show  And then they come in and they go  E-Rock's not fat  I go, but that's the best part  That's why I love this so much  Yes  When Brendan Burns was in here  He's a comedian from England  Yeah  He did the after show  But he's also a big O&A fan  E-Rock walked in  He goes  That's fucking E-Rock?  He's not fat at all?  Exactly  Someone said that to me at your party 
[01:54:30]  That's the best part  Is that they have to come up to you and say you're not that fat  That girl that kept falling down  I walk in and I had no idea who she was  She comes over  Oh, it's so great to put a face to the name  You don't look like anything like they talk about  See?  Yeah  Exactly  Oh, E-Rock  Oh, E-Rock  The just that he has to deal with it is hilarious  That's  Well, why don't you show some appreciation?  I mean, Sean F. went out of his way and made this  He made custom-made boxes of goldfish 
[01:55:00]  For you, E-Rock  For you  Hell, not for me  No one gave me any of these  I gave you one yesterday  No, you did not  You would not take it  Why?  You showed it to me  You said, hey, look at what he made  Is that the problem?  You want your own box?  I don't want any of them  Are you hungry for goldfish and now you're cranky?  What do you mean you don't want anything from him?  I don't want anything from him  All this guy does is give, give, give  Yeah  True  Slopbo  See, that doesn't help 
[01:55:30]  Oh, sorry  It's so catchy  Wait, Sean F. wrote  I'll read it again  Thanks for  Thank you for making snacks a hit  I'm not sure if I know that one  I didn't make this a hit  He's never gonna lose a pound  Slopbo  Slopbo  You don't know if you've heard snacks?  No, I'm not really sure  We all heard it  It's in the fucking podcast promos  Actually, not the new ones  The new ones  It was replaced by Big Fat Guy  Because that's what we need  Just make sure we know it  I think I know it  I mean, Sean F. is saying it's now a hit 
[01:56:00]  And he sent Goldfish because of this  I'm not really sure if I know that one  A hit  How's it charting?  What royalties is he getting from that?  It's pretty angry  He looks very angry  What bothers you so much about this?  You  Me?  We're all in on this one  You started all of this  True  And then you keep  Lighting the flame  And encouraging the shit  Well  And then you giggle like 
[01:56:30]  I don't know what's going on here  You did Moynihan  Where is this coming from?  He gets very  Wow, and you're not even drunk  He's very sensitive  Very sensitive, yes  You really haven't heard snacks?  No, I really haven't  Yes, he has  Everyone has at this point  Why don't we give it a listen?  You don't want to be caught  Looking like an asshole  Not hearing one of the hits  Thank you, Sam, for sticking up for me  Someone has to  Inspire the goldfish  Right  Alright, well this is what the song sounds like  Wait, wait, wait 
[01:57:00]  Who farted?  Who do you think?  You didn't fart?  No, I'm amazed you'd have to ask  Of course I did  I dropped a stinker  I want you to say it like that from now on  It's horrible  Who dropped a stinker?  It's horrible  That's the one under the table  Yeah, because you don't got that  You don't have this one  When I aim right  It sneaks under the table  When I aim left  It circumvents  Yes, it goes around a man  It's a disaster  Wow, Jimmy  Oh, come on  What is that based on?  What did you have? 
[01:57:30]  It doesn't smell like cum, I hope  No  Wow  Oof  Oh, come on  Don't try to butter me up  Can we hear the song  That Sean F. is referring to here?  Sure  You guys are talking about snacks  The cookies and cream Oreo  Eric brought you guys some snacks  Yes, this one is s'mores  This one is vanilla cupcake  No, why?  I'm trying to lose weight  When I'm walking with snacks  All eyes on me  Cookies and cream 
[01:58:00]  Yield big titties  Want a flavored goldfish?  That shit's delish  Eat all you see  Get fat like me  Come on now  Snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks  Snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks  Snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks  Enjoy some goldfish  Snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks  Snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks  Enjoy some goldfish  You want, I can bring some cake tomorrow  Cake? 
[01:58:30]  Only if it's shotgun cake, can you eat it?  Now it all makes sense  Why we got the goldfish today  See?  Full circle  Full circle  That's what we're about on the Opie & Anthony show  That's broadcasting  He's bringing it all around.  Snacks, snacks, snacks, snacks.  Are you guys aware that, you know how you told Troy,  make sure you switch up the podcast promo so that it stays fresh?  Yeah.  Are you guys aware that Troy is simply putting new Sean F. E-Rock songs in the course?  Are you aware that it's longer than any clip of Opie and Anthony in the damn promo? 
[01:59:00]  Opie and Anthony podcast.  20 seconds of a song about me.  Oh, yeah, there.  Here's the material.  Those songs aren't even on the podcast.  Brilliant.  It's just pure lunacy around here, always.  Troy did tell me while he was working on the promo  that he was trying to get everything into it as quick and short as possible  so he would have the most time for E-Rock songs.  Wait, can we hear it now, the promo? 
[01:59:30]  E-Rock, do you have the promo all lined up in there?  This is for our podcast.  Right.  New podcast every Wednesday.  Let's keep pushing that out there.  How's this one doing?  Give me a minute, let me find it.  Quite well.  It's doing well?  Features Patrice O'Neill as we talk about E-Track porn from probably six years ago probably.  Yeah.  I remember it like it was five and a half years ago.  I think I got it.  Elijah Wood coming in in about 20 minutes.  All right, I got it. 
[02:00:00]  Is that a movie or something?  Yes, and Wilford season three.  Oh, yeah.  And he has a movie called Maniac.  And he was in The Hobbit for, I think, two minutes, right?  At the beginning.  Yeah.  He had a little taste in that movie, though.  Oh, I didn't remember that.  Yeah.  Yeah, really quick in the beginning.  Let's hear it, E-Rock.  Let's hear it.  Well, well, look at us.  We got a podcast, finally.  It's a miracle.  Original bits from the show.  This is so illegal. 
[02:00:30]  Classic material.  A whole lot of fucking going on here.  And, of course, the Nugget.  Sex Bagel is a big, fat guy.  His titties are big and round.  Slavo, you rarely see him moving.  Find the Opie and Anthony podcast on iTunes and at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  That didn't demonstrate any of your material.  Not really.  No.  They're just random drops of you saying something.  Right.  And then 20 seconds of slobo. 
[02:01:00]  Slobo.  You don't like the podcast promo, Eric?  Troy, thumbs up on the podcast promo.  I just walked on by.  Soundproof, bro.  Good job.  Troy, good job.  A good job.  Good job.  We did a very good job.  Yeah?  A delightful good job.  It's good.  It's good, yeah.  You did a very good job.  Dude, we bow to you.  We bow to you on the podcast promo.  Good job.  Are you feeling me, Pat?  Totally feeling it.  I'd like to just spotlight the Nugget. 
[02:01:30]  You bow to him?  I bow to Troy Kwan.  Would you say that's one of the finest promos ever produced?  It's amazing.  It's selling the podcast perfectly.  Cool.  Good job.  Cool.  Eric disagrees.  I mean, I guess the majority gets the vote, though, right?  E-Rock's very ungrateful.  He's not appreciative of everything that's going on around here.  I get this.  For him.  E-Rock thinks that you spend in that promo too much time focusing on E-Rock songs.  On E-Rock.  Troy, as a production genius, why don't you explain?  Well, I mean, I just, you know, one of the exciting things about the podcast is the Nugget. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  It's setting the world on fire, Opie.  Huh?  The Nugget.  I know.  It's setting the world on fire.  Yes, it is.  And you guys spend a lot of time talking about it, and a lot of people are getting excited  about it with the podcast.  Sure.  Right.  So I wanted to spotlight some of the good Nuggets.  And a lot of work goes into these songs.  I mean, you have to admit that Sean does a great job with them, so.  Did you get some goldfish?  Oh, that's great.  Thank you.  Do you understand now E-Rock?  No. 
[02:02:30]  Why not focus on what's going to be in the podcast that's put out?  Oh.  In the end, we don't care.  Right.  I think his issue is that so far you've been highlighting only E-Rock songs, most of which  aren't even on the podcast.  Well, one of them made it.  But not the current one.  That was five weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get to the current one, though.  I'm sure it'll be next week.  I'll be an open Anthony Nugget.  What the hell?  Well, Eric's just ungrateful.  Yeah.  True.  I've been saying that for the last half hour.  It really is.  Yeah.  The guy who goes out of his way makes special goldfish for him, and he's mad. 
[02:03:00]  He gets all this attention, and he just has to be shitty about it.  It's like, dude, relax.  Why are you shitty about it?  You're not coming?  No.  And you're happy when people see you, and they go, you know, he's not that fat.  That's nice, right?  Plus, he got his favorite snack custom-made.  Right.  And I'm sure his Twitter followers are going up.  That's what he cares about.  You know what I mean?  True.  People are finding out about E-Rock.  Want to know more about E-Rock?  As you eat the E-Rock goldfish. 
[02:03:30]  These are delicious.  Specially made.  Yeah.  Thanks to Sean F.  So, as long as Sean keeps going, the promos will still be sparkling.  Nice.  All right.  You're going to focus on this kind of stuff for the...  Well, yeah, because the content's great.  Oh.  At the end of the day, that's what it's about.  Great content.  Yes.  Well, thank you, guys.  You can't deny that, E-Rock.  We got some great content coming in.  I guess not.  I want to hear about Jimmy. 
[02:04:00]  Oh!  And his...  Last night.  Last night.  You know, I do Tom Poppers.  Yes.  Live radio shows sometimes.  Radio shows.  They don't turn me around.  People stop breathing, waiting for the end. 
[02:04:30]  So, Tom told me that a well-known, popular...  Actor may be doing it.  Ah.  So, the sketch was about privacy.  And it was in front of a full house at the Village Underground.  Very packed house.  Right.  And so, it starts off where Tom introduces me. 
[02:05:00]  You know, we're joking around about privacy.  I'm saying my fans are bothering me.  You know, I'm acting like I'm a big shit.  And then Amy Schumer comes up and thanks us for doing little bit parts  in our show.  You know, kind of humiliates us.  And we're talking about how famous and what big shots we are.  Sure.  And then... 
[02:05:30]  One of Tom's friends.  Oh, my God.  Do you stop breathing for a second?  Yes.  Sure.  Sure.  A big actor.  Yeah.  Who Tom had said he might get to do the show.  Whoa.  Was set to come up on stage while Amy and I were talking.  Drunk uncle?  Damn it.  No, we couldn't get him.  Hey. 
[02:06:00]  But Tom said that he could probably get this guy.  And he did.  It's so annoying.  It's so annoying.  It's exhausting.  The anticipation is killed. 
[02:06:30]  So what happened?  Well, we were in the middle of the sketch.  And lo and behold, Tom's famous friend comes on stage. 
[02:07:00]  Who is it?  I shouldn't blow the surprise.  Oh, my God.  Wow, really?  No, I'm kidding.  It was Matt Damon.  Whoa.  Matt Damon and...  Because I figured it'll get people to listen to the radio show.  It was a great surprise for the live one.  People are already twittering about it.  But it was Tom and Amy and Matt and myself did a sketch.  Wow.  Can we play the sketch on our channel?  I'm sure once we upload it.  That's great.  Yeah, we've got to do that.  The whole episode destroyed. 
[02:07:30]  And Tom Papa's writing this stuff, huh?  Yeah.  It's called Come to Papa.  And it's on...  I don't know what...  It's like a throwback to the old radio shows.  And there's a live audience.  And it's like the Village Underground.  They come for the show.  They come for it.  They know what it is.  They get it.  Right.  And he just gets guys from the cellar to do it with him.  And Matt Damon had been at one of the shows.  I didn't know he was there when he was there that first time.  And Tom said, yeah, he's going to do it this week.  And we did it.  And it's really, you know, we were all funny. 
[02:08:00]  But he, like, murdered.  Yeah.  And it's weird when you watch a guy who's such a fucking good actor.  Because it is acting.  I mean...  Sure.  And he's just natural.  And I might break down the fucking wall saying Matt Damon's a good actor.  But he was genuinely good in that situation.  He didn't ham it up.  He was just...  He's been in a couple of movies with Tom also.  Yeah, I think he was in...  Tom's got famous friends.  It makes me want to...  He's got, like, legit famous friends.  I hope Tom fucking loses a leg in a skiing accident. 
[02:08:30]  He's got a lot of famous friends.  Fucking Eastwood.  Seinfeld.  Eastwood.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Jim Norton.  Exactly.  This really goes off the cliff quickly.  Tom has two famous friends.  I don't count Seinfeld because he's a fellow comic, even though he was very famous.  Really?  He's a comedian.  Yeah, I mean...  I think Seinfeld transcends the comedian world.  All right, so he's got three famous friends.  You're right.  Yeah.  No, I saw how Seinfeld...  Saw Tom Papa at the Colin Quinn thing and went right up to him like, Tom! 
[02:09:00]  Very happy to see Tom Papa.  Went out of his way to, you know, go say hi to Tom.  When Seinfeld...  He's got that web series where he takes another comic or just an actor or whatever the fuck  and then they drive to get a cup of coffee.  Comedians having coffee in cars?  Is it funny?  I really have not seen any of them.  The fucking Gervais one's hilarious.  Right.  Gervais is so petrified of driving with Jerry.  Jerry's driving a little fast in a little sports car, you know? 
[02:09:30]  And Gervais is just hysterically funny because he's genuinely scared.  For real?  Genuinely scared.  Yes.  Wow.  And Jerry is laughing his ass off, scaring Ricky in the car.  It's very funny because you know you've done this with your friends at some point where  you're driving and they're like, hey, hey, knock it off!  It's in a little Austin Healey.  How much is one of those?  I don't know.  They've got to be pretty expensive. 
[02:10:00]  This is a car if you want to say, I really love British sports cars and damn it, I will  go down with that ship if I have to.  Jerry.  Hello.  Ricky.  Who's that?  Jerry.  Oh, hi, man.  How's it going?  What are you doing?  Oh, I'm sitting here.  I think I've got irritable bowel syndrome.  Oh, gosh.  That is irritating.  Yeah.  Do you want to grab a coffee?  Yeah.  Great idea. 
[02:10:30]  I'm Jerry Seinfeld and this is Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.  Today, my guest is my good friend Ricky Gervais.  He's a very funny, silly English comedian guy.  He's just funny.  He makes me laugh.  What do you think?  It's great.  English.  Is it?  Is it?  I don't know anything.  You don't know anything about cars?  No.  Is this a seatbelt?  Jerry is such a car guy.  I think it's a death trap.  It's a tiny car, huh?  Yeah, very small.  There's no way there's a little airbag in there, is there? 
[02:11:00]  There is, but you have to blow it up.  Quick, we're going to crash.  Right.  Well, I'm a very nervous passenger, so let's...  Did you eat?  I had some cereal.  That's so sweet.  What?  What kind of cereal?  We can't be running out of stuff to talk about already.  If we're going into detail on the cereal, we're struggling. 
[02:11:30]  Look at this guy.  Nobody can explain why the homeless have such fabulous hair.  I like the fact that you start with no one can explain.  Like, scientists have been working around the clock for the last 25 years.  They've spent billions of government dollars, but they've not come up with anything.  Like, who commissioned this scientific study?  Okay, here we go.  Now he's...  Be sensible.  Oh, Jerry. 
[02:12:00]  Sorry.  Are we in the Italian job?  Why are we doing this?  Oh, no, that made it worse.  You...  Jerry!  For f***ing sake!  Tim f***ing going 70 miles an hour!  We're not going 70!  Jerry just laughing at him.  He's genuinely scared.  Oh, Jerry.  Jerry!  Oh, God.  Jerry, why is it so funny to fight in a pro-  Grown man?  Fear is funny. 
[02:12:30]  Fear is funny, yeah.  Especially when it's not fake.  We're so used to fake fear.  Everyone always acts scared, potentially scared.  Don't worry about it.  I'm in a tin bucket with no suspension.  Oh, Jesus.  When was the last time you were this scared?  Doing award shows and potentially ending my career is my...  That's my adrenaline rush.  I work for the Golden Globe Committee.  And this entire thing is a ruse to get you to do the show again next year.  And I'm just going to keep driving you in this terrifying car until you agree. 
[02:13:00]  He is scared.  Oh, God.  I just like how he goes, Jerry!  Yeah.  Jerry!  Yeah.  I drive that fast.  Yeah, Chipper.  Fuck, yeah.  Guy who adds nothing.  Well, Chip's got a new bit.  What?  Yes, there's a Chip bit.  Yeah, of course.  Going to go to break with the Chip bit.  Is Elijah Wood here?  And then we're going to talk to Elijah Wood next.  Yes, that's what we're going to do today. 
[02:13:30]  Welcome to another Viscous Entertainment production of Porno for the Blind.  Narrated by sex god Lyle Chipperson, this is Farrah, Backdoor Teen Mom.  She's sucking his pekka.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now she's still sucking his pekka. 
[02:14:00]  Now she's back there.  She stopped and now she's sucking his pekka again.  She's holding his pekka.  Now she's looking at his pekka.  Now she's back up.  He's got his pekka in her.  He's playing with a clit with his pekka inside of her.  He's got his hand on her leg and his other hand on a clit and he's putting his big pekka inside of her.  She's moaning because she loves his pekka.  She's got her head on a pillow while he slams a cooter with his pekka. 
[02:14:30]  That's a cool picture right there.  You can see her butthole and his pekka slamming in and out real fast.  Now it's out.  Now it's in.  Now it's out.  Now it's in.  Now it's out.  Now it's in.  He's holding her butt cheeks while he puts his pekka into her really hard and fast.  Now he's moving her hair because it's on her shoulder and he's holding her hips and he's putting his pekka in her pussy really hard.  He's giving it to a good fucker.  That's the way I fuck. 
[02:15:00]  Why the fuck did we use that guy's voice?  Thanks for listening and be on the lookout for more Porno for the Blind releases from Viscous Entertainment.  The Opinion Anthony Show.  The Opinion Anthony Show.  What's serious that's out?  We're very happy to have Elijah Wood back in our studio. 
[02:15:30]  And Jimmy making them laugh pretty hard, man.  Yeah, we're just talking about travel and getting your trips paid for.  How long are you off on this press thing you're doing?  Are you just this week or are you going for a couple weeks? 
[02:16:00]  It's just till Sunday.  Okay.  Could you just say what you said off air?  Because I think that's hilarious.  Well, I didn't even really mean it to be funny.  I just said that I have a...  It's like whenever they pay for you.  You can always pay for you to do press.  They fly somewhere and you hang out for a couple days and do your thing.  Yeah, it's FX and the movie company.  You know, take care of them.  Right.  And I just said it's free license.  I literally feel like it's a vacation.  So I tend to act out sexually a lot when I'm doing promotion.  I really do.  But then you said, because I feel like I'm on vacation. 
[02:16:30]  But it does.  It feels like everything's paid for and they treat you nice and they pick you up and you're done, Earl.  It's fucking great.  It feels sexy.  It really, it just feels like what better way to end the day than by dehumanizing some poor drug addict.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Oh, God.  Never going to think about these trips the same way again.  No.  No, but yours is probably a healthier way of doing it.  Wilfred season three premieres tonight.  That's great.  Every Thursday at 10 o'clock. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  On FX, which is great, man.  Where did the show leave off?  I'm trying to remember now.  The end of the second season.  It left off with the revelation that this drawing that he finds with Wilfred, like a childhood drawing with Wilfred in the corner, that he drew it.  Right.  And so we actually start this season with him analyzing what that potentially means.  Nice.  As he's in this sort of existential questioning nightmare.  I have a theory about the show, which I'll ask.  Do you ask Elijah about it off air?  Oh.  Not on air.  No spoilers? 
[02:17:30]  I don't want to wreck something.  Well, that's a spoiler.  If I'm right.  He doesn't have to nod or anything.  Well, there isn't actually a definitive answer yet.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Even amongst the creators.  Like, I have a theory.  I think the writers have a theory, but no one has actually said, well, this is definitively it.  Okay.  Because even Jason, like, Jason thinks that Wilfred is a magical being.  Hmm.  I don't agree with that.  But I think for Jason to play the character from a truthful place, he has to think that the character's real. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  That seems scary that they don't have it figured out yet, though.  Hmm.  Where they're kind of just, they have it figured out, right?  They might have an idea.  I think they have it figured out.  It's not like Lost-ian, you know, where they were, like, making it up as they went along.  I think the conceit is probably what the conceit is.  Okay.  But it is up for interpretation.  And I think the reality is we'll never actually really tell you.  Because I think that kind of ruins what the show is.  Everyone wants to be told. 
[02:18:30]  Everyone wants everything wrapped up in that nice package.  But then when it is, then it's like, oh, that was kind of a letdown.  And obviously with what happened with James Gandolfini dying, you think of The Sopranos and how that ended.  Right.  And people were like, oh, what the hell is that?  And then as time goes by, you realize how brilliant that ending was.  That ending was incredible.  And what did you want?  A slow motion Sam Peckinpah kind of shootout in the place?  It just would have been, eh.  You know, so.  Yeah.  You're right.  There is something to be said for not giving people exactly what they think they want. 
[02:19:00]  Totally.  At that moment.  See, I think my idea is probably wrong, man.  What's that, Jim?  I thought they were going to show a faraway shot of the dog walking away, wearing, like, a hat, like at the end of Silence of the Lambs.  And it says, I'm having an old friend for dinner.  And that's the last time.  What awful endings to movies you have.  I know, I really do.  I love a good awful ending.  Just something that totally wrecks the whole fucking vibe.  I think it's a bit like Harvey.  Did you ever see the movie with Jimmy Stewart? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  The rabbit.  Yeah.  So he's got this best friend that no one else can see, but only he can see.  And at the end of the movie, he gives Harvey to somebody else.  But they never explain what Harvey is.  Right.  So.  You assume that it isn't a real thing.  It's, you know.  Right.  Some kind of mental thing.  Well, does the person take Harvey, or do they go, what is this?  You're handing me air.  Well, no.  This doctor actually sees Harvey and needs him to better his life.  You've seen that movie too, Ant, huh?  Yeah, that was a long time ago. 
[02:20:00]  It's a classic.  It's a great film.  Yeah.  Ant has seen everything.  Literally.  It's unbelievable.  Are you a big movie buff?  I grew up on TV, movies.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's just forever.  Tunnel-visioning television as alcoholism raged behind him in the living room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There were, you know, parental discussions going on.  Discussions.  While I just focused.  That's not happening.  No, that's not happening.  The spaghetti hits the wall. 
[02:20:30]  They were just discussions.  Yeah.  They were discussions.  Heated debates.  Parental discussions.  Yes.  They were very passionate about their opinions.  That they threw in the word, you're a fuckface every so often, while giving their opinions.  Well, just to pepper the line a little bit.  Block it out.  Just focus on Crest.  Toothpaste is the best toothpaste.  We're the other genius.  He's the fucking greatest recall for television.  TV was like, you know, growing up, that was my entire life.  Go outside.  My mother used to have to throw me out of the house to get me out.  I was just fixated. 
[02:21:00]  Everything.  Commercials.  Mm-hmm.  I just would love watching commercials over and over again.  The old cigarette.  Before they banned cigarette commercials, a little kid just sitting there, you know,  doing the, singing the Tijuana Smalls jingles and Doral.  Remember Doral?  With the taste chambers?  Taste me.  Taste me.  No one else remembers.  Taste me.  Take a puff and let me do my stuff.  See, this is what we're talking about a lot.  Yeah, they were like, he's a rain man.  It's incredible.  No one else remembers Doral's?  Doral's had these filters on them, and they were plastic, and they had like a hinge and 
[02:21:30]  a clip.  So it used to dissect the cigarette, and as a kid, I was like, opening it up and making  believe it was a space capsule and shit.  Yeah, it was fucking great.  I was a psychopath.  They said there's a fine line between genius and douche.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Yeah, but then you say, remember Doral's?  No one else remembers.  There might be like five other guys out there.  I don't remember those.  I don't remember those.  I don't remember those.  Do you remember cigarette ads at all?  I do, yeah.  Marlboro, man. 
[02:22:00]  Mostly.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember those, but I'm sorry, I'm just poking with my finger.  I don't remember the ads on TV, though.  I don't think I remember some of them on TV.  Oh, yeah, they were on.  Yeah.  Absolutely, they were on.  Yeah, and they were cool, you know?  Especially the ones that marketed to like teenagers and young adults.  Yes, they knew what they were doing.  They were really cool.  They knew what they were doing.  Kids were partying and smoking.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  Cartoon characters.  Yeah.  You looked badass smoking cigarettes, if you were watching that commercial and thought 
[02:22:30]  that.  Now, if you look at kids that are smoking, it looks so retarded.  It does, right?  Yeah, they're sitting there, and they don't really know how to hold it, or when to take  a drag.  You think we knew how to hold it properly?  No, we looked ridiculous, too.  You know, what are you going to do, though?  Of course.  You've got to go through that phase.  I want to ask Elijah about The Hobbit, man.  Me and Jimmy saw it.  We loved it.  I know you were only in it for a couple...  Yeah.  How long?  Maybe five minutes?  Five minutes, something like that, yeah.  Yeah, the beginning, which was kind of cool, because it was kind of like, oh, I remember 
[02:23:00]  that from, you know, Lord of the Rings.  That's when he leaves to go and meet Gandalf to take a little ride up.  That's the cool thing.  It's literally like 15 or 20 minutes before that first scene in the first movie.  Yeah, it was awesome.  Did you like it, The Hobbit?  Yeah, I loved it.  It's amazing.  I loved it, man.  And you know what it was also?  It was like with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, watching each one.  After The Hobbit, right when the end comes, you're like,  Oh, fuck, it's a trilogy!  That's right!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  God damn it, how long do I have to wait? 
[02:23:30]  I know.  Yeah, you get like the dragon little eye opens and things are kicking ass.  Oh, man.  The eyelid.  Yeah, yeah.  Now we've got to wait a year?  It's about a year, right?  It's a year, yeah.  Yeah, so it'll be December this year.  Solid.  All right, we're getting there.  Solid year, yeah.  Well, they're done with it, right?  We're about halfway through.  They're done making it.  No, well, they shot all of it at the same time, same thing that we did for Rings,  but then they, midway through the editing process of the first one, they realized that they  had to split it into three films, so they had to go back and shoot additional footage 
[02:24:00]  for the third film and I think a bit for the second, which we did on Rings.  We continued to shoot even after the fact, because they would basically have the luxury  of looking at a cut, see what's missing, see what isn't working, and then add new stuff.  Was there instances where technology itself would kind of advance and then you'd be like,  well, now we've got to do that over again or we've got to at least put it in post-production  in some way, shape, or form?  I think that did happen. 
[02:24:30]  I think initially, actually during the film, they were shooting footage of fire.  For the purpose of using that and to digitize that, over the course of the shooting, they  wrote the program for fire, like a better program for fire.  So it's better fire than fire.  That happened along the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Watching the documentary, all the footage that came with the DVDs and everything, you realize...  You could get lost in those documentaries. 
[02:25:00]  Totally, man.  I spent weeks watching those things and you realize how at the forefront of that technology  Peter and all the people involved in it.  It's still rolled up.  It's amazing.  Oh, yeah.  It looks great.  It does a little data.  It really does.  Yeah.  And now you've got a movie also, Maniac?  Yeah.  And this is a remake of a movie from...  1980 film.  80s.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's a little dark.  Yeah.  Just a little.  It's a tad dark.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  It's basically about a serial killer.  It's about a guy who stalks women and kills them and keeps their scalps on mannequins.  It is honestly the weirdest film I've ever jerked off to.  But I got to tell you, there's a...  But you did it on vacation.  That's true.  But there was scalping in it.  And there was one in particular...  They're all really fucking graphic.  But there's one in particular where it just...  It violated me. 
[02:26:00]  Like, it was...  And I'm saying that in a good way.  It was really uncomfortable to watch.  And gore movies don't ever freak me out.  But there was one where it's like, he's really fucking scalping this woman.  And you know he's not.  But it was...  Which one was it?  I want to say it was the second one.  Not...  Not the, uh...  The girl in her apartment.  The young girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it was that...  It was something about the way they shot it.  With the straight razor.  Oh.  Yeah, I think that was the second one.  Yeah, it's brutal.  And you could hear it.  You could hear it. 
[02:26:30]  Crunchy.  And you could see it being lifted off.  Kind of like, almost like a moving head.  And it was just...  The sound design on that was really brutal.  Horrendous.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you play an absolute fucking creep.  Yes.  Yes.  What a dirty fucking...  I'm like, why do chicks want to bang him?  His fingers and hands were dirty.  Red knuckles.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Even his hands are creepy.  So, yeah, there was some really, really great gore in that.  I quite enjoyed that.  You normally play a likable guy.  For the most part, I suppose.  For the most part. 
[02:27:00]  So, that's continued.  Anything?  Anything different you had to do?  Psych yourself up?  Or is it pretty much, hey, here's my part?  Well, this was an interesting role because it was largely not on camera.  The movie's actually in a mostly POV.  About 80% of the film is in POV.  Was that the way the 1980 movie was too?  No.  Oh, okay.  No, which is partly why I wanted to do this.  Because I don't love remakes, specifically movies that don't do anything different or  don't have a perspective that's unique. 
[02:27:30]  So, the fact that they wanted to shoot this in POV and that the killer would only really  be seen in Reflections was really exciting.  So, therefore, the approach is a little bit different.  And it was kind of largely technical on set, except for those very specific character moments  where you see the character.  And then a lot of it was re-recorded.  Like, all the dialogue we re-recorded.  And I felt like the real character work happened there.  Because it's all of the stuff of, you know, a sense of presence, his own inner dialogue.  And I was able to kind of work with the nuances of what the character was.  But it was a lot of fun. 
[02:28:00]  There was a couple of moments where they do it where all of a sudden the camera's just  looking at you in the parking lot.  And it was like, I wonder why they did that.  I didn't mind it, but I was like, wondering.  So, the kills, the idea behind that was this notion that, you know, people talk about having  out-of-body experiences.  Some serial killers have referred to that.  So, it was kind of a nod to that.  And a way to see the character do those sort of heinous things.  And there was a great Achilles slush.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  That's one of the most brutal things in the movie. 
[02:28:30]  Those are terrible in movies.  There's been a couple of them.  Yeah, Pet Sematary is a good one, too.  So, where, uh, old Herman Munster got.  Herman Munster.  But this is a brutal one.  And she's wearing heels, which is just perfect for an Achilles slush.  And it's a gash.  The way it was shot and those scenes were really, really well done.  It's very difficult to make me cringe watching a movie physically.  Because I've seen real live things, I don't know, live leak or whatever, that are worse.  And, uh, these were really fucking horrible. 
[02:29:00]  I think what's interesting, too, is that as an audience member, to a certain degree, you're kind of complicit in what this guy's doing.  Because you're looking at everything through his eyes.  You're in it, yeah.  And that's, that was exciting to me.  The idea that you'd be made to feel a little bit uncomfortable.  Yeah.  You know.  You also, and plus seeing you do it and knowing it was you.  And then seeing your reflection.  It was, again, it was a very out of character.  Even though you're playing a character, everybody knows you.  And it's, it was definitely odd to see.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it was nice.  Cool.  I love to see guys doing that. 
[02:29:30]  I always wish Eddie Murphy had played a rapist or a murderer because he, you know, he's a good actor.  That does sound, that does sound a little odd.  But no, but you know what I mean?  Because Eddie's a really good actor.  But he's always playing the same likable dude.  Like, uh, like, you know, you always, you always enjoy him and he's great.  Yeah, he's great at what he does.  But he's a talented, like, Pryor played, you know, different serious roles.  I wish Murphy would have done that because I think it would have been a tremendous shock to the system.  Yeah.  I mean, I think as an actor, it's, I certainly can only operate this way that I have to do things that are different than things I've done before. 
[02:30:00]  I just have to continue to challenge myself.  And, and also it, by doing other things that people aren't as familiar with in regards to what you've done before,  it also just helps to create more opportunities to continue to expand.  And, yeah, there is that word comic actor that, uh, if some, sometimes people have tried to go from that to serious acting and they've literally been laughed at.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  I thought Jim Carrey has made a couple of great jobs.  Jim Carrey did a pretty good job.  Robin Williams.  Robin Williams, of course.  Yeah, he's a fucking, yeah, Robin Williams.  He's a Juilliard train, but I mean, yeah, he's really good at serious acting as well.  Adam Sandler, not so much.  But has he tried?  However, however, Punch Drunk Love.  Yeah, yeah.  His performance in Punch Drunk Love was phenomenal.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I might have to give you that one.  It's great.  Yeah.  Mm.  I kind of like the one where he has his twin sister.  That was, that was serious, right?  What was that film called? 
[02:31:00]  Jack and Jill.  Jack and Jill.  Well, yikes.  That was uncomfortable.  The trailer was uncomfortable to watch, even.  Well, it wasn't funny, so if it was, he was acting, it wasn't as a comic actor.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's a big jump.  All right, he had one.  Yeah, it's got to be.  All right, he had a bomb.  He had one bomb.  Oh, please.  All right.  He's blown us off, so you can see where this is coming from.  Oh, no, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  He's made for our show.  What were the seeds of discontent?  No, no reason.  He used to call our show here and there, but no reason. 
[02:31:30]  We're perfect for, you know.  We just get our feelings hurt.  Yeah, we really do.  Like, Adam Sandler blew you guys off, and I'm here?  Jesus Christ, I'm leaving.  Dude, as I was walking into the studio, I was like, man, I come here every year.  I'm here for Wilfred.  It's kind of awesome.  Yeah, that's great.  I love it.  It's a great show, too.  TV interviews are so weird, too, because here, you're good on this show because it's  a free-form just chat, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  But a lot of guys come in, actors, or musicians or whatever, and they don't know how to do  more than seven minutes because they're so used to a quick character discussion. 
[02:32:00]  Well, it's about this, and how was it?  But, oh, the crew was a hoot.  You know, boom, boom, boom.  It's out there.  And they don't know how to do, like, a regular...  To actually interact with people and have a normal conversation?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of them don't.  It's really weird, man.  That's funny.  Yeah, it's frustrating.  It's conditioning, I think, probably.  You know, you just get conditioned to a certain thing, and that's what's expected of you.  Right.  I don't know.  You've been doing this for...  I find it more comfortable to have a real conversation, because sometimes those, like, 
[02:32:30]  late-night talk shows, they can be great, but there's also, like, a format.  You know, you have a pre-interview, you actually get, you know, the segment producer comes up  to you and says, so this is what we're going to talk about.  So you kind of have to, like, fit within these parameters.  Yeah.  And I like when that gets thrown away, and you can actually just have a genuine interaction.  There's much less pressure associated with the audience.  I think some of the most classic moments on those talk shows are when the script went out  the window, and they got off on a tangent, and they have a real moment and a real conversation,  and those end up on the highlight reels and everything else. 
[02:33:00]  So, yeah.  Fallon's really good at that.  Yeah, yeah.  I feel like every time I'm on Fallon's show, I have a real conversation.  Yeah, yeah.  We just go off on a tangent, and it's wonderful.  He's great.  He's awesome.  I love Fallon.  I'm nervous about the Tonight Show, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I love him so much, and I'm so excited for the opportunity, because it's a huge opportunity.  But I love what he's so created an amazing niche for himself with his show, and I feel  like he's really defined what that show is.  And my concern is that what that other show needs, because of the time slot, because of 
[02:33:30]  the history that that name has associated with it, and the audience that watches that  show is so different than what the people that watch Fallon's show.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm glad they're keeping it in New York.  I feel like that'll help continue to...  That'll be different, because we haven't seen that in many, many years, obviously.  Yeah.  I get what you're saying.  He'll have to go a little more mainstream with his bits and stuff.  I worry.  They maintain that they're not going to, and I'm sure it'll be an awesome show, but  I love what he's done. 
[02:34:00]  You've been doing interviews and stuff forever, for years, your whole life.  I mean, starting as a very young actor.  When you were put in that situation where you would have to sit down and conduct an  interview as a child, thinking back on that now, do you go like, boy, I really handled  myself well, or are you like, oh boy, I'm just a dopey kid out there?  How do you see yourself as a child, having been put in that situation?  Do you think you did a good job? 
[02:34:30]  I haven't watched any of those interviews in a long time.  Really?  My memory is that I handled it pretty well.  I actually remember being on David Letterman's show, and I knew going into it that David was  kind of petrified with kids on the show, because he was worried that they wouldn't talk.  Right, right.  You know, so he ended up driving the conversation, and I remember he asked me a couple questions,  and I just started answering, and he kind of cut me off and started, because he just  wanted to keep it going.  Yeah.  And I stopped him, and I was like, man, you're cutting me off. 
[02:35:00]  And I was like, I don't know, maybe 12 or 13 or something.  Wow.  And it was pretty great.  Like, I just remember actually having a genuine banter with him.  The audience must have lost it at that point.  It was pretty funny.  He probably liked it, too.  Letterman probably liked it, too.  He probably liked the little stem.  I think he did.  I think he did.  My memory is that he did.  Yeah.  I was on the Arsenio Hall show, too.  Wow.  Yeah.  Way back.  Jeez, that is going back always.  How old were you then, you think?  Man. 
[02:35:30]  I think I was probably 10 or 11.  Wow.  Arsenio.  I'd have to go back.  The radio flyer days or something.  Around that time.  Yeah.  What year is that?  1991, 92.  Did you ever do Carson?  I did, yes.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  That's nice, man.  I know.  He's not even that old.  No, that's what I'm saying.  It's a great one.  To have done Carson.  I think I did Craig Kilbourne, too.  Wow.  Remember him from the original host of The Daily Show?  Yes.  Wow, that's right. 
[02:36:00]  Then he spawned his own show for a while that didn't really go anywhere.  And then Jon Stewart did something with The Daily Show.  Yeah, he came from MTV.  Yeah, yeah.  Stepped into something over there.  It's kind of amazing because it almost erased the memory of what that show was.  Absolutely.  It's so established that it's something else.  And Fallon, I think Fallon will do well because he's different than Kimmel.  Like, Fallon is truer in his nature to what The Tonight Show is than probably what Kimmel does or what Letterman does. 
[02:36:30]  I think Kimmel and Letterman might be more similar and Fallon and Leno might be more similar.  I think you're right.  Yeah, I think universally, I think Fallon's more acceptable to the American public.  People like him a lot, man.  He's very fresh-faced, nice.  They love him.  Yeah, he's not doing anything on there that anyone would really find offensive.  No, and there's a goodness to him.  He connects with everybody.  He doesn't have a bad bone in his body.  He's a genuinely nice guy.  He's one of the most enthusiastic dudes I've ever met.  Right?  Yeah.  He's so psyched. 
[02:37:00]  He's so psyched.  He's so psyched.  It's great.  And it's coming.  It's so genuine, man.  Yeah, yeah.  It's awesome.  It's great.  It's hard to have.  I've only done his show once, but it's like, you can't have a bad interview with him because  I know he just probably jinxed my next appearance.  He's fucking a bomb.  Death.  But I'm doing it tonight.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  He does have such enthusiasm, and he's a fun guy.  It's like, he wants it to go well, and they all do, but he's not jaded at all, and he's  not going to leave you hanging.  He was a very fun guy. 
[02:37:30]  He said, just come on the show sometime.  I was like, all right.  I never follow up, because people are just being polite.  But the next time I saw him, he's like, how come you haven't come on the show?  I really wanted you to come on.  He was being very genuine.  So I was like, immediately.  And I just said, what's your cell number?  And I just...  And I became, what about Bob?  I just hassled him.  Begged.  You said you were me on your show.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy.  Just following up about the show.  He's back.  Here's my pride and joy.  Oh, yeah.  Rupert Pupkin.  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Marvelous.  So you start tonight.  How many episodes of Willard do you have?  Will Wilford, I'm sorry.  That's all right.  There are 13 episodes, and there are two tonight.  Two that air.  The first two, I guess.  The first two.  Yeah.  That was a real TV insider, I am.  The first two are airing today.  No, no.  It's the first one or the last one.  The first and the seventh one.  You watch all the in-between ones.  How did they get to the end?  Yeah.  You kind of watch the rest of the season to figure it out.  Yeah.  The fill-in-the-blank 11, we call it.  I am an idiot.  It's got to be more comfortable for you working than it is working on the standard networks. 
[02:38:30]  You get away with a lot more and stuff.  We were talking about that earlier because of, again, the Sopranos and stuff kind of  really put network television in the toilet because they showed what you could do with  The show almost started it all, you know, between that and Six Feet Under.  Oh, right.  Because we're in a golden age of cable TV now.  Right.  It's extraordinary.  And they paved the way for, you know, the writers and the directors and the actors from 
[02:39:00]  the film world to come onto television now.  It used to be like, oh, you don't want to do television.  If it hadn't been for those shows, we wouldn't be where we are.  It's really incredible.  HBO kind of really paved that ground.  Chris Albrecht and Carolyn Strauss, who started, I mean, they're doing well now, too, with  HBO with Game of Thrones.  Oh, God.  Dude, I'm obsessed with that show.  Yeah.  Obsessed.  I really want to sleep with Khaleesi.  Well, who doesn't?  Jesus. 
[02:39:30]  Come on.  Or any number of the women on that show.  Absolutely.  And half of the men.  You just want to hang out in the whorehouse in King's Landing?  Oh, that's all I want to do.  Just.  As long as someone's paying for his trip.  Do you remember the one, right, exactly.  Do you remember the one scene where they put that young guy with all of the whores, and  then they came back saying that he didn't have to pay for it.  Yes, I do.  And they wouldn't, she wouldn't reveal why.  Yes, I do remember that.  God, bastard.  I remember that well. 
[02:40:00]  And I've always wanted to be that guy.  And I've never been that guy.  Except on vacation.  Except on vacation.  What?  They're saying we have to wrap up.  I don't know.  He's very busy.  You got a lot of press.  What's going on?  He's got to leave?  He's got a live interview at 930.  With who?  With who?  With Cosmo.  Oh, forget.  You don't have to worry about Cosmo.  Stay here.  You don't have to worry about Cosmo.  He's talking into a tin can, and there's attached to a string on somebody on the other end. 
[02:40:30]  Sorry, I nut this shit on Cosmo.  You just did.  Terrific.  Terribly.  They've been very nice to us.  No, have they?  Yeah.  She came in and drank tequila with us.  Oh, that was her.  I forgot her name, though.  Of course she did.  Do you guys drink tequila in here?  We try not to.  Well, no.  E-Rock decided to do a bit called Tequila and Donuts on a Friday.  And he got, how many shots did you do, E-Rock?  I think it was 13.  13 shots of tequila.  Oh, my God.  And then proceeded to tell us all what he thought of us. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Oh, fantastic.  I got the old, I know you don't like me, but I really want you to.  And then...  Oh, the truth just came out of me.  And then his crying.  He started crying.  Was this on air?  Oh, yes.  Fantastic.  It was so embarrassing.  That's crazy.  It was wonderful.  At one point, we go, why are you crying?  He goes, I'm not...  He didn't know he was crying.  No!  I didn't even know.  And the tears were pouring down his face.  I didn't even know that.  It wasn't even a little bit.  It was pouring.  Oh, it was terrible.  That's excellent.  It was wonderful. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, it was utter humiliating.  Horribly wonderful.  Horribly wonderful.  But anyway, Taylor from Cosmo came in and she did some shots.  We're just fucking...  We're just making jokes.  We like her.  Yeah.  So she'll do a great job with you.  Yeah.  Let's promote properly.  Elijah Wood.  We like Elijah very much.  He's Wood Elijah on Twitter.  That's right.  And Maniac, which really is a very disturbing film.  It's June 21st, it opens, and I saw it.  And again, I don't get squeamish very easily, but there were a couple of moments in that  film that were honestly violating. 
[02:42:00]  It's on iTunes, too.  Oh, okay.  Really?  Simultaneous VOD release.  Okay.  And Wilford, the third season premieres tonight at 10 o'clock.  There's episodes one and six are on.  Fucking asshole question.  I'm also DJing on Sunday at the Firefly Music Festival.  in Dover.  Just throwing that out there.  Really?  You're becoming a well-known DJ, too, right?  I don't know how that happened.  I've been DJing on and off for like 10 years, and it's always been something that I've done 
[02:42:30]  just for fun.  Right.  I never really took it seriously until people started to take it seriously.  And now you have to take it seriously.  But it's still an extension of my love of music.  Do you play the Macarena?  That's always a hit at the party.  Everybody does it.  But I play with records, which, you know, these days, less and less people seem to be playing  vinyl.  A lot of your tweets are music-oriented.  Yeah, yeah.  And really, really informative.  But that's got to be something.  If somebody's just fucking rolling on X and they go into the club and it's like, 
[02:43:00]  fucking Frodo is spinning tonight.  It just loses their mind.  They just turn around and leave.  Like, I got to go home.  I care.  I'm just hallucinating.  He's going, yeah, yeah.  It's happening.  What the fuck?  Have you played any of the new Black Sabbath?  I've listened to it.  I listened to it streaming on, I think they streamed it on iTunes.  It sounds remarkably like Old Sabbath.  Yeah.  I need to give it another listen to find the merit in the new songs. 
[02:43:30]  Just on a sonic level, it's very much like the old...  Yeah, number one in the U.S., number one in England, Germany.  Rick Rubin's great at being able to capture what the essence of, especially for artists  who haven't made something like they used to in a long time, he's great at capturing  what they're all about.  Apparently, he sat them all down and played them their first couple of records.  They're like, okay, guys, this is what you were.  This is what we're going to try and accomplish.  Wow.  Which is fucking smart. 
[02:44:00]  It's great.  Forget about all the in-between stuff.  Ozzy, forget about that mullet-headed disco phase you went through.  Yeah, forget that Bette Midler look and shot in the dark.  But yeah, it worked.  He got them to go back.  It's great.  He's a brilliant guy.  It's a lot of the things that you're familiar with.  The drum sounds are a little different.  A little bit, yeah.  But I still think they made a good choice with Brad Wilk.  I mean, if they had to pick a drummer, I mean, they picked a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  And that was Rick's call.  A solid, competent drummer.  All right, kids.  Did you guys love the Daft Punk record?  I didn't listen to it.  Oh, my God. 
[02:44:30]  It's Album of the Year.  Really?  Yeah.  Daft Punk?  Mm-hmm.  You just called it Album of the Year.  I think it's the Album of the Year.  I give it to 13.  Well, let's play a song from it, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Don't play Get Lucky, because everyone knows that song.  Yeah, we all know that one.  Play Giorgio by Maroder.  That's a great song.  Yeah?  Yeah, play.  Starts with a G, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  You got it?  Hang on.  And Elijah Wood requests.  This is kind of cool. 
[02:45:00]  E-Rock.  It's in here.  Hold on.  Yes, it is.  Of course it is.  Why wouldn't it be?  All right, let's play this.  What the hell?  Elijah Wood, thank you so much.  Thanks, guys.  It's always a pleasure.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Thank you.  When I was 15, 16, when I really started to play guitar, I definitely wanted to become  a musician.  It was almost impossible, because the dream was so big that I didn't see any chance, because  I was living in a little town, was studying.  And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician, I thought, well, now I 
[02:45:30]  may have a little bit of a chance, because all I really wanted to do is music, and not  only play music, but compose music.  At that time, in Germany, in 69, 70, they had already discotheques, so I would take my  car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe 30 minutes. 
[02:46:00]  I think I had about seven, eight songs.  I would partially sleep in the car, because I didn't want to drive home, and that helped  me for about almost two years to survive in the beginning.  I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s, the sounds of the 60s, of the 70s,  and then have a sound of the future.  And I said, wait a second. 
[02:46:30]  I know the synthesizer.  Why don't I use the synthesizer, which is the sound of the future?  And I didn't have any idea what to do, but I knew I needed a click, so we put a click  on the 24th track, which then was synced to the Moog modular.  I knew that could be a sound of the future, but I didn't realize how much the impact would  be.  The O.P.  and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  This is The O.P. 
[02:47:00]  and Anthony Show.  What is this?  Tiny snails.  All right.  You thought it was dance music at first?  No, I don't mind it, but I meant what not as in could you say it, but why?  Why are you so upset?  We've played this a million times.  Why are you upset about it?  I'm nervous, because Ricky's coming in.  You know him.  He knows you.  He likes you.  There's nothing to be nervous about.  That's even worse.  It's always easier for me when they hate me, because if they like me, I'm going to blow 
[02:47:30]  it.  But if they don't like me, I can do no wrong.  When you have somebody in here that's like Ozzy or Ricky Gervais who knows who you are,  who likes you already, who's like, oh yeah, I'm going to go hang out with Jim, it's more  nerve-wracking to you because they might not want to be your friend anymore?  What tipped you off?  When I changed continents when Ozzy walked in?  I just don't understand how it could be more nerve-wracking after they know you.  Do you realize I went to a six-hour difference time zone when Ozzy walked through the door?  You're a creep.  No, I'm not nervous.  Just so you could come back a week later and interview him again. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, I'm fucking mad at my mind.  You interviewed him like six times in the course of two weeks.  I did, and look at the album, number one all over the fucking world.  You're welcome, Savage.  Because of Jim Norton.  But no, I was saying we should have played a Ricky song, but he's not coming in yet, so that's  fair, because he's got the series David Brent Teaches Guitar, which we'll talk to him about.  Yeah, it's this great YouTube series where he's brought back the character from the office,  the British office, and is teaching people guitar as the character.  It's brilliant how much he has mastered that character, and like nothing can just bring 
[02:48:30]  it back.  No, and I'm really happy that he did, and I think we think he's here now.  He's one of my favorite people to talk to.  He's always fun.  I think he's a great interviewer.  He's very conversational and casual and funny.  I'll get this out of the way before he comes in.  Sure.  You know about razors, right, Jim?  Of course.  You know your razor doesn't need a vibrating handle, a back scratcher, 10 blades.  Jim, have you noticed the price you pay for new razor blades?  That's what I talk about.  It's how much?  That's all I talk about.  Is that in pesos?  Oh, God, you're right.  And you're doing this. 
[02:49:00]  Answers and questions don't correspond.  And you're doing this every month for the rest of your life.  Well, this is your Dollar Shave Club moment.

I like the way they end that without redundancy.  Right.  Jesus.  Just hammer it.  Hammer it home.  I don't know what to do with this extra Dannon.  I had a Dannon yogurt plain fat-free with some tasty blueberries, and now I have an extra. 
[02:50:00]  Maybe offer to share it with Ricky if he'd like to share a yogurt.  You know what?  That's a really choice idea, as they say in New Zealand.  Have an intern get two spoons.  Yeah.  You want to share a yogurt?  Then share a yogurt with Ricky.  A couple of men sharing a yogurt.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Have you watched the last episode of The Office yet?  I remember a long time ago you always said that you never watched the last episode of The British Office.  Oh, my God, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You did eventually.  Oh, yeah, I've seen it a hundred times.  I made myself wait because it was such a good show, and the show was so incredible that I didn't want it to be over. 
[02:50:30]  And I knew I had that one more thing to watch.  But I eventually watched it, and it was fucking masterful.  It's one of the great endings of any show ever.  It tied everything up.  It wasn't cheesy.  It was believable and funny, and it gave them all, like, this is what would happen to these people.  But it just kind of stayed true to what happens to real people, which is why I'm so obsessed with that show.  But he's also promoting.  Is he promoting anything, really? 
[02:51:00]  Derek.  Yeah, in September.  Will be on Netflix in September.  He has another show.  Yeah.  He did extras.  He did The Office.  Now he's got Derek.  He's got that show with Carl.  Yeah.  Pilkington.  Yeah, Pilkington.  He does a lot of...  Oh, and of course, Life's Too Short.  Life's Too Short on HBO.  It really irritates me, because I have no projects whatsoever, and I would like to have a project with Ricky.  Maybe you could pitch it to him.  Maybe I could be like...  Hey, Ricky, you ever think of...  I could be like your American friend.  We go around.  Right.  That's all I have so far. 
[02:51:30]  But it would be funny.  It would be funny.  It would be comedy.  Yeah.  We just travel and kind of get to know each other and the world at large.  Here he comes.  That's my idea.  I think it sounds pretty good.  That's a great idea.  I think that he'll enjoy that.  Hello, sir.  Ricky Gervais.  How's it going?  Hello.  We're on.  We're on, yeah.  Yes.  Well, let's talk about this.  You're on.  Yes, we are.  And what's this show called?  It's technically The Old B and Anthony.  Right, so...  Why do we need them?  If they're not...  If we can do without them at all, why are they ever here, is my question. 
[02:52:00]  You sound like me in every contract negotiation.  Yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  I mean, it's like...  It's not the first time, either.  No.  It's not the first time.  They can just leave.  Why?  Why are they...  Why are they...  I've got a bad back.  I've got a chipped tooth.  That doesn't wash in the army.  I mean, how many hours do they do a week?  Twenty.  Twenty total, but...  Children do that in a day in sweatshops in Third World.  That's right.  And they don't complain.  You're the man.  Thank you.  What...  I mean, you're treated like an idiot here. 
[02:52:30]  Like a schmuck.  Do you know what I mean?  I do, yeah.  And it's like...  I kind of never phrased it that way to myself, but now that I think of it, you're right.  Seriously, what have they got?  What...  I don't even know which one is Opie and which one is Anthony, just first of all, because  I don't think I've ever really known.  Opie is the handsomer of the two.  The blonde.  It's always...  You always go with the blonde.  And Anthony is kind of the rugged, kind of workman, Italian guy that sits on the left.  I know, I know, yeah.  So, okay, which one's hurt their back and which one's got a chipped tooth?  Opie has a bad... 
[02:53:00]  He's getting an MRI on his...  I think it's actually technically his shoulder, which he's had major shoulder problems.  I've got a really bad shoulder.  I've had a shoulder for three weeks.  And where am I?  Here.  I'm sitting here.  You're doing radio.  I'm sitting here, as scheduled.  Doing your job.  Do you know what I mean?  I do.  I don't know...  What...  Just out of interest, why have they got the job?  What are they...  How are they qualified?  Why...  Why is it not the Jim Norton Show?  This has been my question for a few weeks now.  I've known you for a while.  And I think...  And you've grown.  You've sort of blossomed.  I think of myself as a little bit of... 
[02:53:30]  I suppose...  Pygmalion, it reminds me of.  Because you were like...  You were fat.  You were stupid.  You were disgusting.  Do you know what I mean?  You were...  I do, yeah.  You were revolting.  If I'd have touched you, I imagine it would have been...  Sort of...  I don't know...  Acidy.  Or something.  Just slimy and sticky.  Yeah.  And unpleasant consistency.  Just like...  Sort of like...  Uh...  Come from a crime scene.  Do you know what I mean?  Oh, did I touch it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He did.  Right?  Do you know what I mean? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  And now, look at you.  You're the man for me.  You're funny.  Thank you.  You're smart.  Thank you.  You're reliable.  You're here.  Less fat.  Yeah.  He's just...  You know, you've worked out.  Smart body.  Smart mind.  And you are qualified to do this.  You know, you're a comedian.  You've got a qualification.  You're out there every night.  Right?  Thank you.  Where are Opie and Antony?  This is the question we're asking.  Is anyone listening to this show, by the way?  I would hope so.  I think we maintain an audience. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Really?  I don't think the audience is relying on them being here.  What are the audience?  I mean, are they homeless?  Are they in prison?  Who listens?  Who is listening at 10 o'clock in the morning?  I think it's a...  They can't have jobs.  No.  No.  Not good jobs, anyway.  No.  But then again, you know, Opie and Antony, they're not at work, so I can't really blame  anyone, really.  Opie and Antony have great jobs.  They can leave.  They can come and go and say, please.  20 hours a week.  How much do you think they get paid?  I've never found out, because I know that... 
[02:55:00]  It will just make me put...  I'll fucking open my veins.  They'd be embarrassed by it, surely.  Yeah.  They must know.  They must know.  Whatever it is, they must know they don't really deserve it.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  They're not here.  Yeah, it's in their eyes.  They're not here.  They know it.  It doesn't matter whether it's a million or...  They're not earning it today.  This is the thing.  They're doing nothing for it.  Whatever the amount is.  They're not here now.  I don't know...  I mean, will their wages get stopped for today?  Or is it like, oh, no, it's all right. 
[02:55:30]  Do extra...  Oh, I can't do Thursday.  Oh, we'll do...  Whenever.  Yeah.  Whenever.  Make it up.  When.  When is my question.  When are they going to earn their money?  Well, one has the shoulder and Ant's got the tooth.  You know, they're injured, I guess.  How does this make you feel, though?  I mean...  Healthy.  There's nothing wrong with me.  So you've had to...  You've held this show together.  Yeah, I mean, a lot of people have just said that.  The glue.  Yeah.  Well, there is no Gervais leadership quality around here that's keeping these guys in their 
[02:56:00]  spots.  I'd kick ass.  You would?  There'd be a few people just laid off.  I'd give them...  You know, I'd just get rid of them.  I'd be generous with the package.  Yeah.  I'd say, how much do you want?  Just get out of my sight, because you disgust me.  It would be nice to see the two of them groveling.  Please don't make me redundant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what...  Tell me in your...  You've worked with them, both of you people.  I've only seen them now and again. 
[02:56:30]  Sometimes I see them when I turn up.  We're on the way out.  Yeah, yeah.  You're coming in.  They're going home for the day.  Yeah, they pick up a kid or there was a flood or something.  I mean, we're not talking Noah here.  We're talking a dripping tap, probably.  Yeah.  Just like, this is not...  Oh, I've had a road accident.  I've not had all my teeth knocked out.  I can't eat.  Yeah.  Right.  I've chipped a tooth.  Yeah.  Could wait.  I've got a chipped tooth.  I didn't even go to the dentist.  You don't need to.  You have a bad shoulder and a chipped tooth right now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  You sound fantastic. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Cheers, man.  So what's their best qualities?  What have they got?  Um, I would have to say that their best quality is they've picked a reliable third person who  allows them to go gallivanting.  You're the man.  And you're the man.  What would you, what would it take?  What would it, what would you, if you, if I were to put you in charge of this?  I remember a story once of Brian Adams, right?  He bought a house in, uh, London and it was near a pub and it was a really rowdy pub and 
[02:57:30]  it annoyed him, right?  So he bought the pub and he closed it down.  That's what I want to do to this place at the moment.  You want to buy?  Yeah.  Just because they weren't here.  Just because someone, I feel that I want to, you know, because of syndication, I've got  real fuck you money.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  It's mental.  And I do world tours.  I don't, I mean, I, I don't even see the audience.  There's light in my face, but I'm just thinking that's another million dollars.  No.  And I count up. 
[02:58:00]  And I'm, I know one thing I haven't got kids.  I'm certainly not going to waste it on charity.  Yeah.  So I want to spend, and I want to spend every dollar before I die.  So no one gets any of it.  Sure.  Okay.  Absolutely.  Okay.  You earned it, you enjoy it.  So I want to do shit like this.  I want to pull stunts like this.  I'm going to buy Sirius, close it down, right?  And then just see them wandering around the streets for a couple of hours.  Bewildered.  Right.  Just fucking bewildered.  So what happened there?  Oh, Richard just bought it and closed it down.  Why?  It'd lose money.  Yeah.  He's got it. 
[02:58:30]  What's he doing?  He's watching you from that building over there laughing, masturbating.  That would be it.  That's what he's doing.  And they would wonder what happened to all our opportunities.  And you'd say you didn't show up for them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they start crying.  Plenty of time to take care of the back and the tooth then.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  All your appointments will be filled now.  So, uh, yeah, we could do, what else, what else would we find?  Or you could just, if you didn't want to spend all the money on buying Sirius, you could just  buy out their contract and then say, look, I got a podcast, I'd love you to do it. 
[02:59:00]  And you'll offer a lot of money.  And then you make them do the podcast and then you just play it to an empty room.  No one gets to hear it.  I've always wanted to do that with Celebrity Big Brother.  Just put them in there and then put them in for like eight weeks and then come out and  say we won't film it.  We actually, we have a phone call.  Oh, really?  Anthony.  Anthony's on the phone.  It's easy, really.  Yeah?  Anthony, welcome to the show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Very nice to speak to you.  Rick, your face.  Hi, boss. 
[02:59:30]  I'm going to have you on the program today.  I'm driving and I'm listening to you.  And Ricky doesn't seem to understand.  First of all, we've been there for our show.  Oh.  You book yourself to our show after our show's over.  Oh, really?  I would love to see you do that.  Like, hello, hello, Jay Leno.  Yeah, that's not nice until like midnight.  So, man.  So, what are your hours then?  So, this... 
[03:00:00]  I'll stay a little later.  I'll come on your show then.  But you'll be a fucking undedicated wanker if you're not there when I show up.  So, what's your hour?  What's your actual hours then of your show?  Six to ten.  So, I always come home at the end of your show.  So, I always just think you've left.  Oh, that's amazing.  Oh, I feel that.  I feel that.  I owe you an apology.  You keep booking yourself after our show's over. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, hello, Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah, what time's your show over?  I'll drop on by.  Oh, that's amazing.  Oh, so I should...  What time should I...  So, I should get her at nine next time then, should I?  Nine would be perfect.  For Joe, Ricky, nine would be great.  And I didn't mean those things at all, boss.  I mean, I'm hoping the tooth is fixed and you're healthy.  And right as Dodgers for this after, as we say.  Oh, great.  Bye-bye to you guys.  You got me laughing my balls up. 
[03:01:00]  Have fun, Ricky.  I'll see you next time.  See you later, man.  Maybe I'll stay after school.  See you later.  See you about a quarter to ten next time.  Okay.  We'll have a good time.  All right.  Bye-bye.  See you.  All right.  Cool.  I guess, yeah, we didn't really mention that...  No, the show's over.  Technically, the show's over.  I never knew that.  Yeah, it's over time.  Oh.  Well, that's all still rolling.  So, technically, whenever I...  I think he was on the A.B. and Anthony show, I wasn't. 
[03:01:30]  Whose show is this?  What are we on, then?  We go until...  The show is on until ten.  Everything still stands.  This is still a fucking shamble.  Absolutely.  If you didn't even know when a show ends...  It's an abomination.  The whole thing really is.  And let's be honest.  If his tooth was healthy enough to make your phone call,  it would have been healthy enough to stay here and talk.  He sounded fine.  He sounded terrific to me.  So, people are listening now, are they?  Yeah, they just leave the channel on.  Somewhere, right?  And we replay all day.  People just...  I don't know what they're doing somewhere with...  But Roland also doesn't say when he, you know, emails you or calls you, 
[03:02:00]  he doesn't say,  no, you can't come in at ten, that's when the show's over.  You just say, I'll come in at ten.  He goes, okay, yeah, sounds good.  And you just show up thinking...  So, I'm doing this because people, what are you saying, were too scared to tell me that  I've got the wrong time.  Roland, specifically.  Like some sort of ridiculous, weird, little self-confessed deity on an island somewhere.  Like, some bloke in a robe who thinks he's related to God.  So they go, whatever he said, yeah, it must be...  I look at my watch and I go, no, it's 11. 
[03:02:30]  And everyone looks at theirs and it's not.  And they go, yeah, it is 11.  And they all change their watch.  That's exactly it.  Roland reacts to you the way Dennis Hopper reacted to Colonel Kurtz.  In Apocalypse Now.  That's how Roland feels when he talks to you.  Right, okay.  Yeah, I don't know, he wants to come in at ten.  He's coming in at ten.  But what we do is...  The show will go late sometimes.  Sometimes we go until 11 o'clock if we want to.  Or other times, like four days a week, Sam just does an hour here.  And on Wednesdays, I do an advice show, which is really catching a lot of buzz.  Advice, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:03:00]  That's amazing.  Yeah, very good advice.  So what sort of things do they say?  We thought it would just be a goof at first, like they would call up and, you know, I would  just give silly advice.  But there's a lot of people with marital sexual problems.  Oh, well, if there's one person I'd call, it's me.  That would be, yeah.  If Hannibal Lecter's not available, then not as my man.  We give the same advice, you know, just bite her face and then stand on the cart.  It's, or, you know, drinking and drugs, because I quit that, so they don't know. 
[03:03:30]  You know, they call about that.  And it's really, you know, it's just kind of fun.  And Sirius wanted to give me a raise, but they couldn't just give me a raise.  So what do they ask you about?  What do they ask you about drinking drugs?  What's, what, just...  Well, I want to stop.  What do I do?  I'm having trouble.  I'm struggling.  And what's your advice?  Um, you know, fucking man up and continue.  I like that.  I'll say go through.  There's not enough of that.  There is not enough of that.  And it's, well, I was going to just pull yourself together.  Yeah.  Oh, stop fucking whinging.  Pick yourself up by your bootstraps.  Yeah.  I know, yeah.  And all these new diseases as well.  Yeah, obesity. 
[03:04:00]  That's not a disease.  That's not a disease.  Let's stop.  Let's nip that one in the bud.  Obesity is not a disease.  98% of all obese people are because they ate too much and they didn't do enough exercise.  Under 2% are through things like some thyroid problems, some cancer drugs, okay?  But 98% are fat people.  And they all say it's, I've got, no, no, no, no.  98% of fat people is because they ate too much.  So let's, that's, that's done.  That one's done.  I want to lose weight. 
[03:04:30]  I'm obese.  Uh, eat less and do more exercise.  Next.  You don't think people can be addicted to food like they are to drugs or whatever?  Who isn't addicted to food?  Right.  What, what, what, what animal is not addicted to food?  We are dependent on food, aren't we?  I'm addicted to air, I keep breathing.  I keep breathing and then I breathe out.  I breathe in, I take the oxygen in my alveoli and I take what I need to get into my red blood  cells and I, I, then I, then I, then I ingest CO2. 
[03:05:00]  I'm addicted to it.  Of course you are.  Right.  You have to be addicted to, it doesn't count.  It's a saying to you.  All these people that go, oh, so I'm addicted to sex.  That means you got caught and now you're going to go in the priory for a week.  That's all it means.  There's no, you're not addicted to sex and food and air and water.  It's ridiculous.  I think I'm addicted to sex.  Well, yeah, don't do that now, though.  It's not healthy.  What are you doing now?  It's not healthy.  Yeah.  Yeah, good job.  This is radio. 
[03:05:30]  That's how I show.  I'm happy to see you.  Yeah, I don't think I'd be good at it as an agony aunt.  How much weight did you lose?  Because you lost a good amount.  You look great.  About, um, 70 go serious.  Yeah.  It's a compliment.  A compliment.  Yeah, good question.  Yes, Jebais mused.  Yeah, about 20 pounds.  Oh, you look good, man.  But anyone who's lost weight, it's harder to have empathy for people who talk about losing  weight because we've had to go through it.  I didn't have empathy when I was fat.  I knew why I was fat. 
[03:06:00]  I was fat because I ate too much.  I didn't know how to exercise.  And then I'd then, and you'd tell yourself, oh, oh, I'm not too fat.  I'm not that fat.  Or, or, oh, I'll burn it off tomorrow.  And you'd lie to yourself, you know, but you know all the time.  You know all the time, you know, when you, it's simple.  It's just simple.  Yeah.  You get fat if you're taking more calories than you burn off.  And you make the decision whether you care enough.  I didn't care enough.  I thought, oh, that's all right.  It's all right being fat.  And then gradually you do care enough.  What finally happened?  What was the final moment of clarity or whatever that you were like, eh? 
[03:06:30]  Probably about the 50th time in my life after a binge of about eight sausages, I was saying  to Jane, I'm having an heart attack.  She was going, you're not having an heart attack.  I think I am in a sweat.  And so I thought 48, this is getting silly now.  Right, right, right.  You know, 48, you know, my uncle, my uncle died at 51.  My granddad died at 51.  You know, they smoked a little bit and drank, but they're a little bit overweight.  But it's always possible. 
[03:07:00]  Whatever you think, you know, it's always there.  It's always a little, you know, niggle in the back of your head.  So that's what I thought.  I thought, oh, I want to live longer.  I want to live longer to eat more cheese and get drunk.  You know, I haven't given up anything.  I've done it with exercise.  Oh, you started exercising.  Yeah, yeah.  So I still eat and drink too much.  But then I think, right, that's.  Oh, you said that last time that you exercise for the next day.  Like you like what?  I'm going to exercise, get it out of the way.  And then.  So I'm just sort of maintaining.  Yeah.  What's that?  Skinny laughing.  Skinny laughing.  Did you always talking about you, Roland? 
[03:07:30]  We rate you, mate.  Yeah.  We gave you a good beating.  We rate you.  So then are you more frustrated than when people say I can't lose weight?  Because you hear that from people.  Oh, I just can't lose the weight.  I don't know.  I can't lose it.  Well, they're right.  If, you know, they can't.  Because they would.  Right.  Or they don't care enough.  Right.  I mean, I just think it comes down to that.  As I say, 98% of the time, you're, you're, you're, this is indisputable.  98% of the cases, you're taking more calories every day than you burn off every day. 
[03:08:00]  And what happens is, if you don't burn it off, it gets stored as fat in a subcuticle layer.  And that's what getting fat is.  It's pure, pure biology.  There's no, you know, there's ways to do it.  Run, fat burn, cardio, weights, you know, um, diet counts, counts for about 80% of it.  It's easier to diet and lose weight than it is to eat like I do and work out.  I have to work out like Rocky.  Yeah.  Because of the amount I want to eat and drink.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, if you die. 
[03:08:30]  You fucking lose the fat cells if you're still eating.  It's really hard.  I eat like a fat man.  I eat like a fat greedy pig.  You just enjoy it too much.  And then I, then I work out the next day.  Yeah.  How long is your workout?  Um, I do an hour, but I do weight.  So I've built a bit more muscle, which burns fat at rest.  So the more muscle you've got, the more you can eat.  Do you have a trainer?  Uh, what?  Do you have a trainer or do you do it?  Once a week.  Oh, you do it.  Okay.  But it's like having a cleaner.  I train hard all the way weak.  So I, so I look good to him.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which works, which works, you know? 
[03:09:00]  Right.  And then you get slightly addicted to it, I suppose, you know?  Um, there is a physiological, uh, thing that runners get after a certain amount of time.  Endorphins kick in and you, it's like a little, little.  Runner's high, they call it.  You feel better.  Yeah.  You feel better.  Sometimes if I'm, oh, I'm fed up and I'm stressed and I don't feel like I run, I'll go for a run.  I feel better.  See, I don't run.  My cardio is shit.  Like, I can do, like, I have two different trainers that I work with.  It's hard to schedule.  Jesus.  Yeah, I just, I.  You turn them off to get sick to each other.  Yeah, well, you know, she had me doing this, so you might want to have me doing that, you 
[03:09:30]  know?  Yeah.  Whichever one gets to sleep with me first.  Right, you also got the two hottest trainers.  Yeah, I do.  That work at your facility.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, women.  They motivate me.  I have a bloke who's a skinhead.  I guess that's a motivation.  Yeah.  I'm a bit scared of him.  I'm a bit scared.  He's a boxer.  Do you box?  Yeah, that's what I do, yeah.  That's really good.  Yeah, because, and also, I like it.  So, you know, if I do things like a treadmill, I can do ten minutes.  I'm too bored.  Right, right, right.  It's just boring. 
[03:10:00]  So you've got to be doing something, yeah.  But do you spar?  I used to hit the heavy bag until I hurt my elbow.  I didn't miss any work because of it, but I did hurt my elbow.  So you're here.  Yeah, of course.  I'm still here.  If you just prop it up and you fucking keep talking.  Right.  Absolutely.  Right.  Do you hit the bag or do you actually spar with him?  I do a bit of spar on pads.  I have sparred.  I've even had a fight, which was awful.  Why was it awful?  It was awful because I was a fat bloke.  Oh, so you didn't play.  Yeah, I was, that was like the, yeah.  I mean, I thought the only risk was that I, my heart exploded. 
[03:10:30]  I've always liked boxing.  I love UFC at the moment.  I was just going to ask you that.  I'm going to LA July 3rd to tape something and I'm like, I'm trying to find, I'm trying  to get Bob Kelly to go to Vegas with me because Weidman is fighting Anderson Silva and it's  one of my favorite things to do is go to UFC.  It's fucking awesome.  I've never been.  I've never been to a live one.  It's amazing.  Really?  Have you ever been to a live fight?  Like watching them walk out, man, that fucking wall, especially with the championship fight,  like when it's silver, there's nothing that can feel like the feeling of these two guys 
[03:11:00]  going in the ring.  It's great.  It's so real as well.  It's so real.  And I think Dana White has done an amazing job.  He's brought that sport, you know, from what was like, it looked a bit seedy, like, you  know, bar room cage fighting or something.  Yeah.  And he's made it like, well, I think it's one of the fastest growing sports.  I like his attitude to it as well.  You know, you're not good enough.  Two people, you're not, I'm stopping your purse.  Yeah.  You're not good enough.  He's brutally honest. 
[03:11:30]  Well, you know, it's legal in the entire, all of Canada and all the United States except  New York.  This is the last state?  This corrupt shithouse of a state is because of the cuddle reunion in Vegas.  They're fighting it here and they have like, it can't get past the assembly, the assembly  floor for a vote.  Um, so literally Dana tweeted a map of all of Canada was green and all the United States  was green except for New York state is red.  It's the only place in the Northern hemisphere where it's not legal.  I think, I think because in the face of it, it looks more brutal and more violent than 
[03:12:00]  boxing.  The gloves are smaller, you know, there's kicks, there's, but then when you think of  it, when anyone can't defend themselves, it's stopped.  Yes.  Immediately.  There's more blood because the cuts happen because less padding.  Yeah.  But a boxer gets hit in the head a thousand times and the brain is right on against that.  It's much, much more dangerous than getting a cut above the iron and getting it stopped  or, you know, breaking a toe.  It's much more dangerous in a way.  Boxers are trained to learn how to take blows to the head.  Yeah.  Like that's where all the brain damage and everything comes from. 
[03:12:30]  These UFC guys, like the minute you're choked out or you're tapped out, like nobody's breaking  a bone because right before their bones break and they're tapped out, it stops fighting.  You're tapping out, it stops fighting.  Exactly.  Yeah.  But it looks more brutal, I suppose.  Yeah.  Kicks straight away look more brutal than punches, don't they?  Yeah.  And the R in a way.  And it seems like, looking at it from the outside, it seems like anything goes because  you can just do anything whereas boxing is super rigid.  Which isn't true, of course.  Of course not.  There's lots of rules.  But then again, you know, a kick to the head, it's over anyway then. 
[03:13:00]  Sure.  You don't stand a thousand kicks to the head.  No.  They go asleep as they're standing.  A little bump, a foot hitting you in the head at high speed.  There's just a pile of humanity that falls to the floor.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  No, but I do like the attitude of it as well, that it's, you know, it's no nonsense.  And I think the show, as a reality show, which it essentially is, you know, when you see them  living together and arguing, I think it's a great insight and it's also real. 
[03:13:30]  I remember the first time I saw it, I turned on, I didn't know what it was.  And I think it was, it might have been Chris Lieben, drunk.  Yeah.  Fighting everyone in the house.  I thought, what is this?  This is the reality show I want to see.  Kicking the doors off the hinges in the house and hopping over the walls.  I thought I was hooked.  That should have been the trailer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're all killers.  They can all fight.  That's the beautiful thing of it.  If somebody throws down in the house, every one of them are in the same weight class and  every one of them can fight. 
[03:14:00]  Like, you can't even be a bully in the house.  No, exactly.  And also, I love the fact that it's such mixed styles that, you know, you've got these people  that have got one strike and it could be able, then you've got, they're up against  a wrestler or a jiu-jitsu expert.  Or, you know, I think it's, it's, it's great.  It's probably my favorite sport at the moment.  And mine too.  And you can't always look and see, like, sometimes you look at the guy, the guy who's classically  built like a gladiator.  He's cut up.  He's got an eight pack.  And then you see a guy who's in decent shape, who's a little thicker, but you can't just  look at the in-shape guy and go, he's going to kill the other guy.  Who's the guy?  Who's the mountain guy? 
[03:14:30]  Roy Nelson.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Now you'd think that he, he was an out-of-shape guy.  Right.  And he did exactly what everyone said he was going to do.  He's sort of, he lumbered forward and he did this just ridiculously natural punch.  Yeah.  He, that overhand right is deadly.  Yeah.  Incredible.  But he just lost though, because the, his, like he took a fight on short notice with the  guy, I think.  And he lost like last week, but he, he, he can't get knocked out.  He has a head like a fucking water buffalo.  He cannot be knocked out.  So he lost on a third round decision.  He's three round decision.  He just didn't.  He was really, yeah, I think his cardio was a little bit, cause he seemed like he was 
[03:15:00]  so, cause he just puts his hands up and then goes to the overhand right.  And I think he just lost wind after the first round.  Maybe he had a chipped tooth or a sore, a sore shoulder.  Yeah.  Oh, it's, I don't work Fridays.  Yeah.  Maybe it was that.  Yeah.  It's after 10.  I can't fight after 10.  Do you think they're more compelling when the guys hate each other or do you just watch  for the sport?  I don't care how they feel about each other.  I never, I sort of believe it more with them than I ever do with boxing.  Uh-huh. 
[03:15:30]  I believed it with Tyson.  Right.  Um, but I, I'm always cynical when it's two, it's two guys, you know, we've, we've got  a few really good boxers in England, but we, we haven't got that many, we haven't got  as many world champions as you.  So when you see two people that aren't number one and two arguing, you think they're boosting  ticket sales a little bit, you know, and I, I think they've got to get themselves in  that place.  You know, they can't, and it's also, it is a bit boring if, you know, even the best 
[03:16:00]  boxers in the world, some of them don't make a lot because they haven't got the receipts,  you know, they, they, they might win, but you want, you do want, you know, extroverts  or do people, yeah, Lennox Lewis, I mean, what a great fighter, but amazing, not a great  promoter, but what do you think your opponent, oh, he's lovely.  Yeah, I know, yeah, I'm a Puget specialist, you want to hear, you want to hear Tyson say,  I want his bone to go through the back of his neck, right, pierce his brain, you know,  you go, well, this is going to be a good fight, if that guy is going to try and put that bloke's 
[03:16:30]  nose bone in his brain, you know, that's, he's promised to murder him, yeah, someone just  got in trouble for saying, now, what was it, he said, it was a fight, who was it, um,  Was it UFC or was it boxing?  No, it was boxing, and, uh, and he said something like, uh, uh, oh yeah, I'm gonna, um, I'm  gonna, it was a term that you use, um, Murder him, uh, I'm gonna, it was something like, yeah, 
[03:17:00]  I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna absolutely go for it, I'm gonna kill him, you know, and  he was in trouble, and I was thinking, well, one, that's, he doesn't mean it literally,  and even if he did, this is two people trying to knock each other out, it's like, who's  getting sensitive?  It's kind of the gig, isn't it?  Exactly, yeah, but, uh, uh, yeah, it's, um, it's funny how people, uh, the, the promotion  game is everything, really, because there's so much, there's so much money now you've got  to make, because everyone wants so much money from it. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, or you're, or you're not valued, I mean, uh, there's nothing worse for the, uh, the  establishment than, like, when a guy like Larry Holmes is champion, I'm sure they made money  with Larry Holmes, but they, he wasn't likable, people just didn't like Larry Holmes, especially  after Ali, um, and a monster like George Foreman, and then you see a guy like Holmes, who's just  kind of quiet, or Michael Spinks, these guys aren't great promoters.  Well, it's funny, because both, both those, Holmes and Lennox Lewis were voted one and  two, um, best, uh, jab of all time. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, yeah, Larry Holmes had a left jab that was like a fucking sledgehammer, and I guess  Lennox did too.  Yeah, yeah, which of course is fantastic, but people want to see flying hooks and uppercuts  and finishes and, yeah, or at least the promise of those, like, is it like, like Chael Sonnen  from the UFC, like, he's a good fighter, but he talked his way into main event fights,  do you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, but then it is, is, the money comes from it being showbiz, that's why, that's  why, you know, um, the, the, athletes don't make the same money as boxers, because it's 
[03:18:30]  how fast you can go.  No one's booing at, um, Usain Bolt, because he didn't win in style.  You know, you, you, you, okay, you were, you went the fastest, but, um, you weren't  bowed by anyone, you weren't, you know, there was no flurry at the end.  Right, right.  You know, you should, you know, it's, uh, all they can do is, is win, and that's it, you  know, I quite like, I quite like the definitive nature of that sort of sport, though.  Did, uh, did he pass the line first?  Right.  No ambiguity, there's no voting.  Right.  It's not like, you got a 3.2, oh. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  You know, it's like.  You are the fastest man in the world.  That's it.  It's objective.  If we can find somebody to run faster than you, they'll be better than you.  And there's bad, there's obviously bad refereeing decisions, and, you know, um, so there, there,  there's always a little bit of ambiguity with that, but, again, that's why knockouts.  Yeah, you never leave, and Dana says that, don't leave it in the judges' hands.  If it's close, you can't leave it in the judges' hands, because they do make the wrong moves  sometimes.  You gotta knock the guy out.  I mean, that's the way to win the fight.  That's not to, you must take that, um, in court, though. 
[03:19:30]  That's only in, uh, that's only in UFC.  Yeah, yeah.  In court, this is the wrong thing to do.  Yeah, don't leave it in the judges' hands, no, never.  Yeah.  You, uh, so you wanna go to a fight.  I mean, uh, there's one in Vegas, July 5th, and, uh, I mean, they have them, like, once  a month, big events, but the Vegas one is a big event.  Yeah, I bet.  It's always fun.  It's De Silva and who, is it?  Uh, Anderson Silva, and he's fighting against Chris Weidman.  And, uh, I think Weidman's undefeated, and they're saying he may be, beats, uh, Silva.  So, it should be a good fight.  I like, I like this show. 
[03:20:00]  The first half of it was slagging off.  Yeah.  Two people who weren't here and not meant to be here, and I didn't know that.  No one told me.  The next half of it was promoting UFC.  Like, Dana White needs us.  They're going, oh, thank God.  Two people on the opening, not opening, they weren't there.  Really gave us a great build-up.  Yeah.  But it is, uh, well, talk about the language and, like, where they say, like, don't, he  got in trouble for saying I'm gonna kill, uh, this guy or whatever it was he said.  I mean, uh, now you do stand-up, and what, what are you feeling about, because I know how 
[03:20:30]  I feel about the language policing that's going on in stand-up, or the obsession over  terms and all this stuff that people are giving comedians?  Uh, well, I think, um, it depends.  I mean, I assume you're talking about offense.  Yeah, or what people find are offensive or inappropriate, and-  Well, offense isn't a case of right and wrong, is it?  It's about, it's about, um, feelings, and feelings are personal.  Um, I think you've got to, you know, comedy comes from a good or a bad place, you've got  to know, you know, what side you're on. 
[03:21:00]  Um.  But, um.  I can't believe it.  Now Roland's talking.  I know, Roland, he does it a lot.  It's rude.  It's unbelievable.  Roland, he'll come in and dare people to look at him.  Unbelievable.  Um, so, uh, I- I mean, you have to take everything.  When people say to me, I ask comedians this all the time, is there anything you wouldn't  joke about?  Right?  Firstly, the answer's no.  There's nothing you- you shouldn't joke about.  It depends what the joke is.  Okay?  But people don't say that to writers. 
[03:21:30]  They don't say to a- uh, novelist, is there anything you wouldn't write about?  Well, no.  So we know it's about how it's treated.  So, they assume that, um, comedians treat things without, um, care, due care and attention.  They're, like, not considered.  Like, they have no morality.  I- I see this all the time on Twitter.  Um, this- this people who think that, uh, uh, they say things to me like, um, uh, so,  are you never offended by anything?  I say, of course I'm offended by things. 
[03:22:00]  But, it's personal.  But what I'm offended about isn't the same as you.  You know, you can't- it's not objective.  And you don't want people penalised for being- for offending you.  You don't want them to get in trouble if they offend you.  Um, no.  Well, it- it- again, it- it- it- you have to be specific.  You can't really talk in the nebulous because it's too difficult.  So- but, um, uh, uh, so, in my show, I deal- the- the big thing is that very often,  with- particularly with taboo subjects, which is what we're talking about, um,  very often people mistake the target of the joke with the subject of a joke. 
[03:22:30]  And they're very rarely related, particularly in comedy, particularly if it's mildly satirical,  and particularly if it's a good comedian who knows what they're doing.  Um, so, uh, people's, um, they get stiff when you talk about, you know, race, disability, religion.  Okay?  But wait.  Wait.  Because everything I deal with is- is in those taboo subjects.  And you- you talk about- like now, we're not trying to be funny, we're talking.  And so we're- we're using all those terms. 
[03:23:00]  No one's- no one's angsty.  No one's going,  but they're- because they know there's not a joke.  We know that we're discussing it, and they know that, you know, you can talk about those subjects.  But when it comes to a comedian, and obviously, very often, comedians aren't being themselves,  they're being a heightened version, or they're being, uh, provocateur,  or they're trying to take the audience to places it hasn't been before,  and people get confused.  And I think that it comes down to people getting it or not.  And, uh, I- I sort of-  I want to sort of say to people, 
[03:23:30]  you not getting my joke isn't my problem, really.  Where about the-  I shouldn't even be defending it.  I shouldn't even be talking about comedy as a comedian.  I should, you know, but I do, because I like to do it as an interest.  But I'm not talking about this as an expert, or as a- as a professional.  I'm talking about this as- as just a person.  Because I like- I like discussing these issues, and, you know.  And we all know the difference between-  and this is what bothers me about people's fake outrage.  I don't believe the outrage.  Because we all know the difference in intent,  when someone's intending to make you laugh,  and the difference between that and when someone's making a serious statement. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  There's a different intent,  and a different effect you want it to have on the audience.  Absolutely correct.  And they know that.  And they pretend they don't know it.  Well, I think comedy is a- as an intellectual pursuit.  And I- I think as soon as it gets emotional on purpose,  i.e. with intention from the comedian,  it stops being funny, and it stops being comedy.  It starts being rallying.  I mean, I've had- I've heard some comed-  so-called comedians come out,  and they say things like, um,  what are we gonna do about all these immigrants?  And it gets a round of applause from the audience.  They think, well, that's- that's not a joke. 
[03:24:30]  Right, there's no punchline.  That's political.  That's just you putting your agenda across with like-minded people.  You know, that- so, I'd say that- and then very often they say,  well, do you think that's so-and-so joke?  I wanna say, well, it wasn't a joke.  Mm-hmm.  You know, um, like Michael Richards going crazy,  uh, you know, he was- he was stressed,  it- it- someone upset him,  he wanted to hurt that person's feelings, right?  Yes.  Uh, that wasn't comedy.  I think he stepped outside of comedy.  I'm not disclaiming it, because I'm a comedian, 
[03:25:00]  I wanna say,  I think he did something other than comedy.  He was reacting angrily as opposed to being funny.  Exactly, yeah, yeah.  Well, he wasn't being a comedian.  He was being a bloke,  who was a- he stepped out of character, almost.  And we're all- we're always in character a bit  when we're, you know, we're being a comedian.  Sure.  And we want the audience to make that leap with us.  What- what about the idea-  and somebody hit you with this on the phone  earlier this week,  like, the responsibility that you have for-  because you're talking to an audience.  So, like, let's say the audience 
[03:25:30]  doesn't get your nuance,  or doesn't understand what you're saying,  and takes the context of your joke and-  Well, but- but- well,  I don't think you should legislate against stupidity.  Uh-huh.  Because there's only so many nods and winks to cameras  before you're not doing anything special at all.  If- if everyone gets what you say,  there's not much to get.  What- why do we want everyone to understand?  Why do we want to talk to a groom full of adults  who have paid a hundred dollars  the same as we talk to a five-year-old?  You know?  Yeah.  You talk to a five-year-old 
[03:26:00]  because they have to get what you're saying.  It's important that they understand  what you're saying without ambiguity.  Uh, with- with no frills,  with no- with no agenda,  with no, um, double meaning or level.  Don't- don't put your hand in the fire.  Why not?  Don't.  Don't put your hand-  Do you understand me?  Don't put your hand in the fire.  Yeah.  That's not my job as a comedian,  to tell them not to put their hand in the fire.  Not to fucking spoon-feed them, exactly.  Yeah.  Yes.  You know?  I- I- I- I've entered a contract here,  and the contract is,  I'll say what the fuck I like, 
[03:26:30]  and if you don't like it,  don't come again.  Or just get up and quietly go,  like, the people with the whole Tosh incident  about the rape joke,  and it was like,  that woman was wrong because she heckled.  Like, I always-  I thought that she had every right  to get up and leave,  because if you're not enjoying something,  you should just leave.  But not to take control of the show.  It's not your business to do that,  because you wouldn't do it in a movie theater.  Let me tell you,  if she was in a movie theater,  and she was in, say, uh,  or watching, uh,  she wouldn't dare stand up  and throw paint on the screen  if she saw something she objected to.  Or she wouldn't put her hand  in front of the projector 
[03:27:00]  so nobody else could see it.  She would just leave.  But because you're in the room with her,  people feel entitled  to make you know their opinion.  Well, that's the difference, again,  between freedom of speech and censorship.  Censorship isn't turning off your own telly.  That's up to you.  Censorship is making everyone else  turn off their telly  because you don't like  what's on the telly.  And that's a big difference.  And I think  people sometimes get confused  with what freedom of speech is, 
[03:27:30]  you know?  Um,  basically,  I think offense  is the collateral damage  of freedom of speech.  Some people don't get offended  by anything you say.  Somewhere, somewhere,  they might not get it,  they might not care for it,  it might not be their cup of tea.  And that's fine,  you know?  But they have the choice.  You know,  as a comedian,  I don't go around  knocking on doors  and sitting on people's surface  and shouting my shit at them.  They've come into my world.  They've come into my church.  Do you know?  Yeah.  They're going to hear my sermon.  That was a great way, 
[03:28:00]  sorry to not understand,  but that was a great way  to phrase it.  Offence is the collateral damage  of free speech.  That's a really good way  to say it.  And people don't understand  free speech either.  No, they don't.  They think that means  you can do anything.  I say about freedom of speech  is one of the most important things  that we have  in a civilized society,  freedom of speech, right?  And I have to explain to them,  and I say,  why do you block people?  I say,  well, that's up to me.  Your freedom of speech  isn't your freedom to be heard.  Right.  Or, 
[03:28:30]  even if you're heard,  listened to,  or even if you're heard  and listened to,  taken seriously.  The freedom of speech  ends with you saying  what you want.  And it's the same principle  as you saying  that they came to your church.  Like, if you're tweeting  something out,  you don't intend  for the world to see it.  You intend for those  who follow you to see it.  Exactly, yeah.  You've come to my door  and you've complained  about what I'm saying  on my sofa.  It's like,  just leave quietly.  You don't have to do anything.  Just go home.  Just block me, whatever.  Right.  And this is what an idiot says 
[03:29:00]  as well about freedom of speech.  And they say,  oh, what?  So Hitler was right?  No, because he wasn't  saying things, was he?  He was killing people.  That's not saying,  that's doing.  Yeah, and his intent  was not to make you laugh.  It was to rally people  to genocide.  Right.  Big difference  between that  and what our...  Genocide is not covered  within the boundaries  of freedom of speech.  That's doing what you do.  Yeah, and you know,  if Hitler just went around  saying shit,  fine. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  It's allowed.  If he just went around...  If the worst thing  Hitler did was say awful things,  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay, he's a bit of an idiot.  I don't want to be his friend.  Right.  But...  He's allowed to say it.  As long as he doesn't  put any of that into action.  You're okay, Hitler.  You're okay with your  funny little mustache.  Don't do anything,  though, will you?  No.  Okay, because he's illegal.  His first murder.  His first murder.  Oh, you haven't stepped  them out there, mate.  Yeah, yeah.  You did the line.  You did it.  Yeah, but we're talking,  you know.  It's another phrase  that annoys me  as well.  Militant atheist. 
[03:30:00]  Militant atheist?  Uh-huh.  Well, you mean  I said stuff.  That's what...  That's what a militant  atheist is.  Yeah.  I'm going to go  onto a crowded tube station,  unbutton my shot,  and talk about science  and shit.  Yeah.  It's a horrible army.  Yeah.  There's so many things  I want people to know.  What militant means,  what freedom of speech is,  what...  What, um...  Oh, the burden of proof.  People...  There are people  who tweet me things like,  you can't prove  God doesn't exist. 
[03:30:30]  Nope.  No, I can't.  Yes.  Great.  I say things like,  you can't prove  Santa doesn't exist.  They go,  that means ridiculous.  Of course he doesn't.  Well, that's insane.  It's ridiculous.  Of course he doesn't.  Man with a white beard  doing shit in that time.  Don't be fucked on the bollocks.  Really.  You're great on Twitter, man.  You really...  I love the fact that  as famous as you are  and as big as your career is,  it's like you don't worry  about saying the wrong thing  and you don't...  I love that you...  As long as you're honest... 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  ...you can't be held  accountable, really.  Um, in that...  That Tosh,  what's his name?  Daniel Tosh?  Yeah, I didn't know  about the joke or anything.  It was raging  and people were asking me,  what do you think about Daniel Tosh?  I said, what's happened?  Said, uh, rape joke.  It shouldn't be a rape joke.  There's no...  You should never joke about it.  I said, well,  it depends what the joke is.  I'm like, no,  of course it doesn't.  You should never rape...  And then someone sent me a tweet  and she said,  I will laugh at a rape joke  the day I know  that no one in that audience  has been raped.  And I just tweeted back,  what a strange door policy.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:31:30]  I don't know that way.  Two, please.  I certainly...  Can I just ask you a question?  Have you been raped?  I have, yeah.  You can't come in.  I'm sorry.  It's a policy.  It's not me.  No, because there's a woman  at the front  and she's only going to laugh  if she knows that  no one in the audience  has been raped.  So, uh...  That was a great one.  Yeah, I remember that  very specifically.  But, like,  what an ass she is  to say that  because that means  you won't laugh 
[03:32:00]  at a drunk driving joke  or you won't laugh  at a pedophile joke  or you won't laugh  at any type of  domestic violence reference.  Also, what is a rape joke?  You know,  I wouldn't, you know,  I'm not...  I don't find rape funny.  It's not.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's one of the worst,  hideous things.  But there's so many  levels to get...  I mean,  technically,  the door policy joke  is a rape joke.  Well, if that's a...  Yeah, exactly.  I think.  Yeah, exactly.  I think so.  I think they mean  the subject of rape  as opposed to... 
[03:32:30]  Again,  if you're laughing  at someone who's been raped,  that's not a joke.  That's just,  you're a horrible,  nasty...  I don't find it funny.  There are some people  that would find it funny,  but they're serial killers  and rapists.  Right.  OK.  And the thing is,  again,  stupid people  treat jokes about bad things  with the same fear and loathing  as intelligent people  treat the actual bad thing.  And they're not related.  You know,  a joke about a bad... 
[03:33:00]  That's what humour's for.  To get us over bad things.  That's exactly what,  evolutionarily speaking,  a humour...  So it gets us over bad shit.  If you can't joke about bad shit,  there's no point joking about good shit.  Yeah,  because it's already happening.  We don't need it.  We don't need it.  It's already good.  Everyone likes a balloon.  Who gives a shit?  It's like,  laughter is this drug  that cures bad shit.  It's a drug here.  It cures good shit.  I don't want that.  Yeah.  I like good shit.  Yeah.  I want some of that cures bad shit. 
[03:33:30]  Well,  laughter's the best medicine.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Those people,  a lot of them aren't dumb,  but a lot of them aren't dumb.  A lot of them aren't dumb.  A lot of them are...  Dumb is almost  letting some of them off.  Some of them are dumb,  but some of them are  so self-centered  in their opinion.  And there's a real self-centeredness  that comes with it  and a self-importance  about what I feel  is appropriate is appropriate  and what you feel  is appropriate is not.  And I'm the arbiter of that.  Well,  they don't like a comedian  having this superpower  of freedom of speech  and exercising it so well. 
[03:34:00]  Right.  They can't stand it.  I mean,  these are the people  that go to comedy shows  with the intent  to catch you doing something wrong  and catch you saying something  you weren't supposed to  so then they can blog about it  or they can, you know,  tell the world  that you shouldn't be doing  what you do.  Yesterday,  someone tweeted me,  there is a cure for cancer.  It is called praying.  And I sent back,  your application  for chief of oncology  at this hospital  has not been successful.  Right?  Sure.  So,  so that's a clear joke  about how stupid  it would be 
[03:34:30]  if we took praying  as a cure for cancer seriously  as opposed to  all that stuff  that cures cancer  that we've researched,  right?  Someone gets involved  saying,  oh,  so you're laughing  at the fact  there's no cure for cancer.  Nope.  I'm laughing at you  because you're  a stupid fucking idiot.  Right.  So you don't get  what I was saying.  Basically,  he's angry  on false pretenses.  Yeah.  I've had it happen to me.  Someone in the paper  has said,  look at this terrible joke  and they've done the joke  and it's wrong.  They've got the joke wrong. 
[03:35:00]  It's so important.  Every,  every aspect of a joke  is important.  The syntax,  the semantics,  the rhyming,  sometimes even some  of the visual aid  that comes with it.  Taken out of context,  it's fr-  the better the joke,  the more fragile it is.  Well,  sarcasm doesn't read in print.  You know,  um,  I'm happy he died  reads terribly like,  oh yeah,  I'm happy he died.  There's a tremendous,  that was me acting,  there's a tremendous difference  and people know that  and we have that common  bond of language  but people,  what I hate about people  is they pretend  they don't know it 
[03:35:30]  because the bigger goal  is to get you to not say  what they don't like.  Exactly.  And that's all it is.  And some people,  you know,  again,  there's,  in a Venn diagram,  there'd be lots and lots  of overlaps  but some people  are genuinely angry  and they don't know  why everyone doesn't  find the same things  wrong as they do.  Yeah.  Then they just want  to retweet.  Then they just  don't like you.  Then they just want  to say something  because no one listens  to them.  Yeah.  Ever.  That's often,  that's often the case.  An excuse to be heard.  Absolutely.  An excuse to be heard.  They're frustrated  that they're not heard 
[03:36:00]  like we are,  that they haven't got  that platform  so they want to bring us  down a peg or two.  And if they say,  if you say you're sorry  and if you've wounded  somebody,  when people are wounded,  what's wrong?  Talk,  we'll listen to you now.  Yeah.  People want to pretend  that they're wounded  by somebody's words.  Well, yeah,  I had many complaints.  You know,  I used to work  in a public sector  I used to work  at a university  and they had a complaint  and sometimes  they just couldn't  believe you called  them back.  They go,  oh,  don't worry about it.  They wanted to  talk to someone.  Yeah.  They wanted to be heard  and, you know,  that's all,  they were happy.  They were happy. 
[03:36:30]  You know,  and I think that is  the case sometimes  but I did a show  Madison Square Garden,  okay,  so a lot of people  I did jokes about  race,  the Holocaust,  Anne Frank jokes.  Oh, no.  Pedophile jokes,  everything.  I got a letter  from a society  saying,  oh,  we loved your show.  We found it there.  We were very disappointed  at the joke  about Anne Frank,  right? 
[03:37:00]  And I said,  but you understood  the satire  behind the famine joke,  the pedophile joke,  the racist joke.  You understood that  because it wasn't  your thing.  Right.  But you can't get  over your thing.  You think,  well,  why is,  you know,  I'm the same  with some things.  I don't like certain  jokes about certain things  because I can't  get over them  emotionally.  You know,  I don't,  but I've got to  keep that quiet.  I've just got to,  you know,  you've got to take  the rough with the smooth,  you know?  And you can understand 
[03:37:30]  on that intellectual level  that if their intent  here,  here,  and here  was not malicious,  here it probably  wasn't malicious either.  Yeah.  You know?  Just because you don't  like that being brought up  doesn't mean that  this guy was  trying to hurt your feelings.  No,  exactly.  And that's what it feels like.  That's what offense  feels like.  Offense feels  that why is he  having a go at me?  And you've got to  step back from that  and go,  well,  he's not having a go at me.  He doesn't even know you.  Yeah.  Unless I name you.  Right.  You know,  I think that's,  that's,  that's one thing  I don't do 
[03:38:00]  too often.  I don't say,  well,  one,  I,  I,  you know,  again,  it depends what the target  of the joke is.  And sometimes,  even if you name someone,  they're not actually  the target of the joke.  They're instrumental  in getting to the target of the joke.  So I can understand  why someone  would feel bullied  if,  God,  he just got on stage  and talked about,  I mean,  I imagine why  Opie and Antley feel.  Yes.  There's no ambiguity there.  Spent 20 minutes.  Exactly.  Trashing them.  Them specifically. 
[03:38:30]  They've got a point.  They've got a point there.  But if I was.  What's more offensive,  you,  you bashing them  or their coworkers  applauding behind you?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Oh,  are we dead?  Yeah,  exactly.  Um,  so I think  it's,  you,  you have to take  the personal out of it.  I think,  you know,  and I think  the better the joke  is,  the more universal it is.  Or if they admitted  what they're really doing.  Like,  I would respect people  if they said,  you said something  I don't like  and I really don't want  you to be able to say it. 
[03:39:00]  But there's a,  there's a self-centeredness  in that honesty  that they won't do.  So what they have to do  is create,  even to themselves,  a reason that seems legit.  Well,  here's why you shouldn't  make fun of race.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  But here's why you shouldn't  make fun of drunk drunk.  Everyone has a reason.  No one ever just comes out  and says the truth,  which is,  I don't like it  and I don't want you to say it.  There's an ugliness in that.  Well,  I think there are reasons  you shouldn't make fun of race  because no one can help their race.  But you can make fun  about race.  You can make jokes about race.  Right.  But you shouldn't make,  you should,  I don't think you should, 
[03:39:30]  this is what I'm saying  about the target  and the subject of the different.  You know,  the reason why  you shouldn't have a go  at anyone for anything,  they can't help.  And the reason why  real racist jokes  aren't funny to me,  and not because I'm offended by them,  because they're not true.  As soon as someone says,  why do Mexicans da-da-da-da,  that fact is usually spurious.  It's not a true fact.  It says there's an injustice to it.  Okay.  Do you know what I mean?  I do. 
[03:40:00]  I don't know if I agree,  but I do know if you agree.  Well,  if someone said,  why are Swedish people  all paedophiles?  My first thought is,  they're not.  Oh.  I can't,  now I can't laugh  whatever the punchline is.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah,  and Jim wanted to move  when you were there.  I was just saying,  yeah,  I'm gonna fucking  go for dual citizenship.  So,  I think,  I think,  again,  the joke fails.  If every part of it  is totally untrue,  it's rallying,  and that would be,  that to me would be people  wanting,  you'd need them to all agree with that. 
[03:40:30]  Hey,  all the Swedish people  paedophiles,  for it to be funny  or get around applause.  And so,  it fails,  it fails purely  on a comedic level to me.  Okay.  Not on a political one.  Right, right.  Do you know what I mean?  I do.  And you're also not saying  that people should get,  the important thing for me  is if somebody,  there's certain jokes  I don't like too.  Yeah.  But if,  I've never called for anyone  to be penalized for them.  And so,  I never have a problem  with people saying  they don't like certain  type of jokes.  No.  Or they don't think,  like I had a debate  with a feminist  and who I actually wound up 
[03:41:00]  liking on an FX show.  We talked about rape.  You just said that  like it was a surprise.  I went in there  with all the prejudices  you would have.  I was surprised though  because her opinion  and mine are vastly different  and we didn't change  each other's opinions  but we had a respectful discussion.  I think I saw it.  I think I saw it.  I think it was,  yeah.  It was on,  yeah,  it was online.  Yeah,  it was great.  It was great.  But,  you know,  the thing was  she wasn't calling  for people to be censored.  She had a very tricky argument.  We just didn't see eye to eye  and the frustrating,  everyone comes to a crossroad  in a debate  where we realize 
[03:41:30]  we're not going to change  each other's minds.  So do we say,  okay,  but that's when people get angry  when we don't get our way  and can't change our mind?  As I remember,  and I don't want to misquote her,  but as I remember,  her worry was  that I think she had a term  called,  um,  Rape culture?  Rape culture,  yeah,  where,  uh,  the assumption was  if it's all out in the open  and it's okay to joke about,  um,  it desensitizes people  and can cause,  uh,  an environment  where rape wasn't so  heinous and terrible  and, 
[03:42:00]  and I don't believe that.  I don't either.  I don't,  I don't think anyone  has ever gone,  and I saw a funny,  uh,  rape routine.  I'm going to try it tonight.  Right.  I don't think that's ever happened.  I don't either.  And,  and I think that's a big misconception,  big,  because,  because we can joke  about terrible things  that we're somehow condoning it  is totally untrue.  And I,  I,  I couldn't find  the actual bad things  that I joke about  more offensive  and more disgusting  and want them to end more  than anyone I ever know. 
[03:42:30]  But that doesn't stop  me joking about them.  That's the challenge.  To me,  that's almost what  the beauty of being a comic is.  It was like,  I,  I did jokes about the beheading  in,  uh,  in Britain.  And the point was,  Okay,  that's too much.  The point of the joke was,  it had something to do  with the way,  uh,  radical Islam treats women,  which was negative.  And,  uh,  but people,  they,  like you say,  they grow,  the minute they hear.  Well,  I need to hear the joke.  Yeah,  you need to hear,  you need to hear,  exactly,  it depends.  And you,  as you said,  you,  you said joked about it.  And, 
[03:43:00]  um,  and that's the important thing.  Uh,  at no point,  I did,  do I imagine you ever condoned  that,  that act of violence.  No,  and people know,  and people read sarcasm,  and people,  you know,  it's like a lot of times,  and there's been times  where I've said things  that I didn't sincerely mean,  but a lot of times,  the joke is in the ludicrousness  of the opinion.  Of course.  Like,  people know,  and every reasonable person knows  that you don't mean that.  You just,  it's like if you say  your dick is eight feet long,  nobody actually says,  no,  it's not,  and means it literally.  They're fucking morons.  Well,  some people are morons. 
[03:43:30]  Some people don't,  don't understand it.  And,  and,  and I do that.  And,  um,  as I say,  you sort of play a slight character.  And,  uh,  I think people get to know  the thing you're playing.  I,  I,  I started with sound up  and on TV playing a character  that I'd said all the wrong things,  but everyone knew that,  you know,  I came down politically on the wrong side.  I say things like,  Nelson Mandela,  um,  what a great man.  It used to get a round of applause.  Just saying that,  I got a round of applause,  like,  in the right audiences.  They just clapped,  just clapped his name.  25 years. 
[03:44:00]  Uh,  he's been out now about 20 years  and he hasn't re-offended.  I think he's going straight.  Which shows you prison does work.  But they knew that was wrong.  They knew that was back to front week.  Yeah.  On stage.  I get it.  He's misunderstanding,  you know,  so they,  they understand some things,  but it's not their thing.  Right.  It's not their thing.  The whole thing,  that's just so weird  about what's happened with the internet  is that,  cause like,  you would think,  you're putting out so much content  on the internet now,  and you would think  that that would be 
[03:44:30]  the ultimate sort of,  this is where I put my stuff.  If you like my stuff,  here's the link to it.  If you don't like it,  you never have to click it,  you never have to see it.  It's not on your TV,  it's not going to pop up at you,  and none of that's ever going to happen.  But,  people even more so  than anywhere else,  of course,  seek out what they don't like,  so they can write a comment,  so they can tweet you some,  of course,  nonsense.  So they think that,  they think everything's personal,  yeah.  Yeah.  They,  they,  basically,  the,  the,  the Twitter,  if you follow someone,  you've got to imagine  that you're standing by a notice board  in the middle of a big town, 
[03:45:00]  and someone comes up  and puts up guitar lessons,  right?  Mm-hmm.  And then they're standing there  and they go,  but I don't want to learn guitar.  Right.  Well, no,  it's not,  it's not actually a,  I don't want to learn guitar.  I want to learn that.  Yeah.  I don't,  I don't do,  oh,  for fucks.  And so they forget  that they're standing by the notice board  in the middle of a big town.  Right.  Just keep walking,  you'll find Vangelis in somewhere.  There might be Vangelis in somewhere.  I don't know. 
[03:45:30]  Well,  why tell me,  I wasn't talking to you,  honestly,  I wasn't talking to you.  So yeah,  everyone takes everything personally,  and everyone thinks  that what they care about  is what everyone should care about.  Right.  And that,  that's a,  that's a given.  I would imagine,  though,  when you put out something  like the David Brent guitar lesson videos  that you've been putting up,  like,  there's nobody  that's going to be offended.  Like,  are there,  is there any negative response  that comes from something like that?  Well,  people say,  well,  yeah,  people,  some people say things like, 
[03:46:00]  this is the worst guitar lesson  I've ever seen.  No,  people don't take it seriously.  Yes,  they do.  Well,  I'm starting to think.  Of course they do.  I've been,  you've,  you've got to be on Twitter  and you've got to read  more comments left on YouTube  to,  to know that the human race is fucked.  Yeah.  It's.  Apparently.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You,  you,  you know,  I'll tell you,  Jim Norton is in the top 2%  of great humans.  And that's saying something.  Thank you.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's right.  Smart,  articulate,  uh, 
[03:46:30]  rather handsome,  not hands,  classically handsome.  Oh no,  and you're symmetrical.  Right,  right.  There's a roundness.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like two pairs on an oval,  but it somehow works.  Yeah.  You,  but I'm starting to think though,  with the David,  because I've,  I've watched the guitar lesson,  of course,  and I'm starting to think that  it's like,  it's,  it's more,  David seems to just like to segue  into playing his songs.  Well,  that's it.  I think people don't,  people don't even understand  that,  that people,  that,  that they,  you know,  the,  the YouTube is perfect for David Brent. 
[03:47:00]  He can't believe his luck.  He was stitched up by a documentary team.  He went in the wilderness.  He still wanted to be famous,  but now he's discovered,  you can just put your own stuff up there.  And again,  he's hijacking his own thing.  Right.  Because he went there to do that lesson,  but actually,  he wants to talk about,  and he,  he takes questions from people,  and he stitches himself up with the questions,  because he hasn't looked at them properly.  And it's just,  it's not even like it's another crew this time.  No.  It's his own deal.  He's in charge,  which is,  again,  which is good and bad.  Now,  the thing about that is, 
[03:47:30]  because he's in his,  his,  his element,  you know,  he's in charge of his own destiny.  So he's a bit happier,  you know,  he's a bit older,  he's a bit wiser.  Um,  so I've got to find things that niggle him.  He hasn't got a boss coming in and ruin it.  He's doing his lunch hour.  He's a rep,  you know,  so he's got to stitch himself up.  He's spending his lunch hour making YouTube.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So,  so,  uh,  you've got,  you've got to eek it out.  So he gets these questions,  and he,  you know,  he,  he can't believe he's talking about himself,  but then he remembers something,  and it'll annoy him. 
[03:48:00]  It'll annoy him,  you know.  So,  David Friend's got to be poked by a stick somehow.  Uh-huh.  And,  you know,  when you're by yourself,  he's got,  it's his own mind that has to poke him.  I guess,  I didn't even think that.  It becomes difficult,  because there's nobody there to point out the platoonary.  No.  Like,  there is nobody that I relate to here.  No,  exactly.  So what do you do by yourself to annoy you?  Read comments on YouTube.  Right.  So,  and that's how,  so he takes his expression.  So,  you know,  and of course,  99% of people are idiots. 
[03:48:30]  So that wins,  because it annoys him.  It,  he doesn't get the respect he deserves.  But where's he looking?  He's looking on toilet walls.  Of course.  And that's what the internet is.  Getting offended by someone leaving a comment,  or tweeting you something,  is like going to every toilet wall in,  in the world and going,  how dare they say that about me?  You know,  again,  it works both ways.  Yeah.  You know,  you mustn't get offended.  Even if it's you by name,  they don't know you.  I mustn't get offended by someone saying your shit,  and they spell that Y-O-U-R. 
[03:49:00]  LAUGHTER  There's nothing,  better than a grammatically incorrect insult.  It's wonderful.  The greatest retweet you could ever have,  is when you just correct someone's grammar,  as they're insulting you.  Oh,  oh,  sometimes,  I,  I said to one,  one,  I'm going to do the book of my favourite tweets.  One,  one said,  you dumb atheist,  spell atheist incorrectly,  if we, 
[03:49:30]  if we come from monkey,  why are there still monkey around?  I just,  I think I tweeted,  I want to give this tweet a Nobel Prize.  But yeah,  anger,  mixed with indignant ire,  and bad spelling is the best.  Right.  Yeah,  they're funny,  they're instantly funny.  Yeah.  Oh dear.  There's a great moment,  by the way,  one of the videos of,  I think it was,  Space Man Came Down,  which is,  just the songs themselves, 
[03:50:00]  without even the guitar lessons around them,  are so wonderful.  Well again,  they're not,  they're not comedy songs or such,  they're not spoof songs,  they're inappropriate for David Brent to be doing them,  particularly,  if he's meant to be,  he's got a job,  right?  So,  um,  one of my favourite things in pop music,  is when,  there's a different motive,  right?  This is not for someone to dance to,  or,  chill out to,  or,  you know,  woo a woman to,  this is someone who's trying to end racism in three and a half minutes,  in the key of C, 
[03:50:30]  or,  to bring down a fascist regime,  you know what I'm thinking?  Right,  okay,  uh,  E minor,  E minor for fascist regime,  and so,  that pomposity of everything,  it doesn't matter if it's David Brent or Bono,  always makes me laugh a little bit,  you know,  the fact that I can,  I can,  you know,  change,  I can end racism now,  just like Paul McCartney and,  um,  Stevie Wonder ended it with,  uh,  Ebony and Ivory.  Of course.  But they're believable songs though,  the thing about the songs is,  they're not written,  over the top crazy,  they're like,  they're legit, 
[03:51:00]  like there's parts of them where you go like,  ugh,  like oh god David.  Oh,  if they were real,  they'd be excruciating.  But that's the beauty of it.  Of course,  yeah.  And that seriousness that he,  Is this for me?  It certainly is.  Was it really?  Of course.  We didn't want to ask you,  how is it just,  I can't,  I've got my shoulder.  Wow,  music on,  oh I really have,  I can't play it.  No?  No,  I've actually,  I haven't done my shoulder in there.  Oh no,  now I feel like I could play it like that.  There you go.  I can't,  pretty girl on the hood of a Cadillac, 
[03:51:30]  yeah,  she's broken down on freeway nine.  I take a look and get her engine started,  leave her purring and I roll on by,  bye bye.  Free love on the free love freeway,  the love is free,  the freeway's long.  I got some hot love on,  the hot love highway ain't going home, 
[03:52:00]  cause my baby's gone,  she's gone.  So again,  not a comedy song,  but it's a song about Brent going across America.  He's never been,  in the context of what it's in,  because he's singing this song like he's this touring musician.  Of course,  yeah.  And he couldn't be further from it.  And it's just such a ridiculous fantasy of like breaking down,  you know,  uh,  yeah.  She's dead.  She's not dead.  Yeah.  Oh, 
[03:52:30]  look at that.  I can't even play him.  I show,  oh,  what would I do if I was a real pop star?  It's so great.  You are a real pop star.  I take the day off.  Yeah.  We have to promote for you too,  because we have not,  of course it's Ricky Gervais on Twitter and YouTube.com slash Ricky Gervais.  I can't get enough of David Brent being back.  Life's Too Short,  uh,  to wrap up,  uh,  especially as July 5th on HBO.  5th of July,  with Val Kilmer,  like you've never seen him before.  Honestly,  you will love it.  He does,  he's,  uh, 
[03:53:00]  yeah.  You saw him out.  He's,  he's great in it.  It's really funny.  Okay.  Yeah.  Uh,  I think it surprised people.  Oh,  good,  good,  good.  I'm glad to hear that,  because we've heard a lot of weird things about Val Kilmer.  It's good to hear about him in a comedic sense.  I didn't think it was weird at all.  I think he's really sweet and sincere,  and he's funny,  and he's really dry.  He's really dry.  You know,  the people who have been through the meal of Hollywood and everything.  Um,  but he,  he,  uh,  he's great in it.  He's really great in it.  Yeah.  And Derek,  he's coming to Netflix.  12th of September. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't got,  have I got you the copies of that?  No,  we've never,  never got copies.  Right.  I would love them.  I'll get,  I'll get you them.  You're not allowed to show opening up.  No,  I won't.  They wouldn't get it anyway.  So do a review.  They'd be too busy.  They'd feel really frustrated.  They can't believe it.  This is like,  this is like,  um,  do you ever do that thing when you're at work?  You,  you wish that you could undermine your boss all the time.  Like,  you'd get the deals and he wasn't to be part of them.  This is like that,  isn't it?  Yeah,  it certainly is.  This is like,  you're like Michael J. Fox in The Secret of My Success.  Yeah, 
[03:54:00]  I'll know something they won't know and I won't,  uh,  cue them in.  Yeah,  exactly.  Um,  well,  that was fun.  That was lovely.  Yeah,  you're probably my favorite guest.  It was really,  I'm really happy you came and,  uh,  it was,  it was really great having you.  Which one's Opie and Anthony,  what way round is it?  Anthony is the more,  the rugged,  like the,  the,  the more,  the workman.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  The ruggedly Hanson.  Yeah.  And Opie's the blonde,  uh,  across who's got more of the boyish looks.  This sounds vaguely homoerotic though.  I know you've got to do a description.  It was good.  You've got,  you deserve his nipple.  The ones that,  whose nipples harden as the breeze comes through a bathroom window at seven o'clock in the morning. 
[03:54:30]  The highlight just hits his eyes like that.  It was weird.  It was sort of too descriptive.  Believe me,  if I would have,  do you know what I'd have said?  What?  Um,  one's got dark hair,  one's got blonde hair.  Yeah,  but I just,  they're more to me than that.  They're my mortgage.  Thank you.  The great Ricky Gervais,  and,  uh,  thank you so much.  Yep.  YouTube slash Ricky Gervais,  Derek on Netflix in September,  Life's Too Short,  July 5th.  Thanks a lot,  Ricky.  Bye-bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show,
