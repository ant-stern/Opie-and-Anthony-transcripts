<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with playful banter between Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, quickly shifting to a discussion about their listeners, ranging from the average person to potential serial killers. Opie recounts a bizarre five-hour Times Square trip with his nephew, encountering Black Israelites, the Naked Cowboy, and a human statue.  An email from program director John Minnelli unexpectedly reveals a foot fetish and praises a recent foot-related segment, sparking a lengthy, humorous discussion on feet, including listener calls detailing various foot issues.

The show then transitions to a segment mocking Hallmark cards addressing sensitive topics like miscarriage, cancer, and homosexuality. The hosts read several cards aloud, reacting with shock and humor to their often insensitive phrasing. A caller recounts receiving a "dead dog" sympathy card, and another female caller discusses her large feet and her own foot fetish.  This segment includes simulated recording sessions with sound effects and the repeated phrase "I was only joking," escalating into increasingly absurd tangents.  The hosts acknowledge the controversial nature of their discussion, hinting at more cards to be read, but the broadcast cuts off before they can be.

The next segment begins with continued riffing on insensitive Hallmark cards, including one with a pop-up black python, accompanied by racially offensive language.  The hosts also critique Jim Carrey's David Caruso imitation, calling it a "hack."  In-studio guests Rich Voss and Bonnie announce Bonnie's pregnancy.  A significant portion focuses on teasing Rich Voss about his weight gain since quitting smoking, involving weight-guessing and jokes.  Jim Norton joins via phone, participating in a pop quiz featuring frequently used show terms and mentioning upcoming performances in Addison, Texas. A Britney Spears Chia Pet commercial airs, prompting jokes about her shaved head.  Further discussion revolves around Bonnie's pregnancy and Rich Voss's perceived unpreparedness for fatherhood.

Audio clips from "Jackie the Knife Girl," a previous guest featuring sexually suggestive content with knives, are played, leading to a discussion about YouTube's censorship of her videos. The conversation returns to the Hallmark cards, continuing jokes about cancer and speculating on Hallmark's reasoning.  They then discuss a man who broke into his neighbor's apartment with a sword, believing a rape was in progress, only to find the neighbor watching pornography. The segment concludes with a mention of Roland's upcoming appearance, a truncated sex offender story, and promotional information for Chicago appearances.

The show then covers a news story about Mark Sullivan, a sex offender who printed child pornography at a library on Valentine's Day.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Bonnie, and Roland joke about the incident, speculating on Sullivan's actions and motivations, including details from his search history. A game ensues where Roland describes movies using one word at a time.  This segment features humorous anecdotes from Rich Voss (mistaking Daryl Strawberry for another Black man) and Opie (taking nude photos from library books). The show also covers the hosts' past experiences, including near-legal trouble involving underage girls, a chaotic studio incident with intoxicated female guests, and discussion of Break.com.  Numerous listener calls are incorporated throughout.

A substantial segment focuses on Break.com, its content, and management challenges.  The hosts discuss various videos, including one of a woman defecating in a hot tub (3 million views), another with a young girl's inappropriate comments ("wiggles"), and a video titled "God Hates Fags." They discuss complaints and content removal.  Brian from Break.com guests, discussing website financials, bandwidth, advertising, and viewership (1.5 million daily visitors).  Tangents include a head-shaving contest for $1500, a rat leg in a cookie box, FDA-permitted rat hairs in meat (allegedly 16), Bonnie's pregnancy, Opie's relationship dynamics, penis-related jokes, and a story about a cigarette-related death. The segment concludes with discussion of the "plus minus" game, overtime, and upcoming events;  an audio clip of a woman defecating in a bag and throwing it at a truck window is teased but its airing remains uncertain.

The show's final segment briefly covers plans for a St. Patrick's Day gathering at FH Riley's, potentially including a chaotic show and karaoke, mentions a new MySpace design, and the possibility of giving away shirts.  Discussions touch upon time constraints, a "bonus show," and a wet hot dog smelling like tuna.  No guests are mentioned in this segment, which concludes with a Bowdog sponsor mention and the website address ilike2listen.com.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Shut up!  No!  Opie.  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton.  Look at his face. How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Vagel. 
[00:00:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I was only joking.  I am open.  Oh, it might be a little loud. 
[00:01:00]  It was a little loud.  Trying to wake everyone up a little softer lately.  It was loud.  It's time to wake up.  It's going to scare everyone.  You got to lean over and just go, wake up.  Wakey, wakey.  Well, here we are.  Hi.  What do you envision when you talk to these fine folks out there?  A lot of people waking up right now.  They're hitting their alarms.  They're hitting the snooze.  They're turning down the volume just a little bit. 
[00:01:30]  They start their days with the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you envision, Anthony?  They're in their beds right now.  It's very dark.  And they just turn us immediately off.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't turn it down when your alarm goes off.  You have to just shut it off.  Then when you get up, maybe go into the bathroom and get ready.  Hey, everyone's got a radio in the bathroom, right?  You know the average American?  The average American wakes at 6.30 a.m. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, a little average American trivia.  That's right.  Is it average American trivia Thursday?  Might as well be.  Well, why not?  Give us a call.  1-866-313-FREE.  What the hell?  I feel like we have something else to do today.  We'll do some hack morning show bit.  That means we can kind of call it in for 28 more minutes.  Most people aren't even awake yet.  They set their alarms for 6.30.  We learned that just minutes ago.  We wake a lot of people up is what I'm getting at.  And you wake up a lot of single guys living in their basements of their parents' house. 
[00:02:30]  You're waking up the young couples, a few older couples, lonely guys in general.  And then I envision that we're also waking up a serial killer somewhere.  We can only dream.  Hopefully that he's a fan enough to leave our names or a bumper sticker on one of his victims.  We like to think that it's all nicey-nice and that we're entertaining American, all the nice people. 
[00:03:00]  But we're entertaining a creep out there somewhere, some horrific individuals waking up to our voices right now.  You think it's going to just be like you said, nice people getting ready to go to work?  And for the most part, sure, that's what it is.  You know, the 9 to 5-ers.  There's one or two out there that have choked a hooker.  Yeah, trying to figure out what tie to wear.  No, it's not just that.  We're waking up some horrific people as well.  Someone that, for years, just wakes up, head in their hands, crying, thinking about what he did 20 years ago. 
[00:03:30]  Can't get over it.  Why?  Wondering if today's the day he gets to knock on the door and they figure out the crime.  They found the DNA.  Right.  Found a piece of hair and some cold case files been working on this 24 hours a day for five years.  Five years.  He realized at the crime scene that he had gloves on and everything, but he scratched his head really fast.  Everything.  He knows he dropped a hair or two.  I know there was, I felt a scratch on my neck and I believe there was some DNA under her fingernails. 
[00:04:00]  Every day he's just looking at the cars go by his house, wondering if they're slowing down because they're taking a look at him.  And now he knows he's screwed because this show's on to him.  Right.  It's like, oh, if Opie and Anthony are on to me, the police are knocking on my door at any minute.  Oh, we're on to you, that's for sure.  We're on to you right now.  Yes.  Well, it's the Opie and Anthony show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  I'm a little tired today.  A little tired.  What happened?  I had to hang out. 
[00:04:30]  Not had to.  I got to get that negative crap out of my vocabulary.  I had to.  I was only joking.  I was hanging out with my nephew, Carson, yesterday and my sister-in-law.  And we had a good time.  Carson.  We spent like five hours in Times Square.  Holy Jesus.  Five hours in Times Square.  Five minutes down there.  Did you, did you, what is he, nine years old?  He's going to be, yeah.  Did you set him up in front of the black Jews that do nothing but yell at white people? 
[00:05:00]  That's what I would have done.  The Israelites.  The Israelites.  Oh my God, are they angry black people?  Oh, they're the greatest.  They're angry black people.  They say that they are the true tribe of Israel and all they do is stand there and berate  white people.  They call them the devil.  And yeah, it's just really some of the most hardcore racist crap you'll ever hear in your  life.  And it's funny because yeah, Times Square is a tourist.  That's where the tourists go. 
[00:05:30]  So there are children walking by and these people are just yelling about the devil and  how we've stolen everything and we're going to burn in hell and they are the only true  religion.  I know what little kids, you know what's silly about that?  So you got that going on and a half a block up, you got a naked cowboy playing guitar.  The naked cowboy.  And you have the black guy painted like a statue that just stands there for a half hour  and then moves his arm and scares people. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, you want to see how quick they can move?  Reach for his money.  Yeah, reach for his money bucket.  Not even in a joking fashion because some people do that like, oh, watch me.  I'm going to try to take some of the money out of the bucket.  I'm going to make a move.  No, take the bucket and run and you'll see statue guy turn into a human being guy that  wants his money back.  Very fast gentleman.  But naked cowboy in his stupid underpants taking pictures with all the fat housewives  from across America.  He's got to wear three pairs of underpants because he was wearing one pair and the police 
[00:06:30]  said it was too, he was showing off.  Too see-through?  Yeah.  Too see-through-ish?  He was showing off.  Yeah, but it's a, and they just lose their minds as they're getting their pictures taken  with him.  Oh, it's the naked cowboy.  Boy, we've had him on our show.  He's a zero.  He's a bore.  He really is a bore.  I used to work at Viacom doing the MTV stuff or VH1, me and Florentine were doing something  and the black Israelites were outside the building.  They're right there. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yep.  And it was great because I was smoking back then so when I'd go out for cigarettes or  lunch, I used to love to stand there and watch them and just smile and nod.  Like you agreed?  Oh, I couldn't get, enough of it.  There was never heard wisdom like they were saying.  Nothing annoys them more than a smiling, happy white face just nodding.  Oh, yeah, nodding.  Good point.  Because their whole job is just to aggravate every white person that walks by.  Oh, yeah, they just want you to hate them.  Well, they're getting rid of most of that stuff in Times Square.  They're really pushing everything out.  I mean, it is, it is. 
[00:07:30]  Even that?  They're trying.  You don't get the, you don't get the tortured ching chongs anymore in Times Square.  The Falun Gong?  The Falun Gong crew.  Falun Gong.  Yeah, they've taken up base downtown a little bit more.  I don't understand.  They get tortured for doing yoga in China.  Like, I don't, and don't call.  I don't really care.  There's who really does.  I've been trying to figure it out on my own because, you know.  No one cares.  You walk around New York City and you pass these people and they're like,  jail cells and they got fake injuries on them and they look like they're suffering. 
[00:08:00]  They put them in like these bamboo cells and carry them around and they put like makeup  on themselves to look like they've been beaten.  Yeah.  And they go, this is what is happening in China to Falun Gong.  So then I'm thinking Falun Gong must be some political party or something and maybe it  is.  And like I said, don't call.  I don't care.  It is.  But then you read a little bit and it has something to do with yoga.  So you go, well, then just stop doing yoga.  If this is going to happen to you, that's all I know.  Just stop.  You've got a government over there. 
[00:08:30]  The backward dog or whatever the hell it's called.  All powerful.  I don't.  Stop doing the warrior one pose.  What are you doing?  What?  They don't like that in China.  They'll beat you for it.  You know what you tell the Falun Gong?  People go, just find out about their cause.  You go, look, where can I donate to the Chinese government?  And I really like what they're doing.  Yeah.  So they've taken up base somewhere else.  But it's always gotten me.  It's like, why in New York?  I mean, there are people working here on a daily basis.  Does everybody have to come here to protest? 
[00:09:00]  Protest in your own country.  Show some real bravery.  Do that old stand in front of the tank scam in Tiananmen Square like that one guy did.  Be a hero.  One brave guy.  Where's he, by the way?  Oh, where is he when the cameras got shut off?  Oh, he's missing a foot.  I guarantee it.  At the very least, at some labor camp somewhere.  And he held up his arms, so you can imagine those are gone, too.  Yeah.  Anything he used to block the tank is gone.  It's just his head.  He lost a foot and two arms. 
[00:09:30]  That's what they do in that country.  So I'm in Times Square checking out all this stuff, and I'm at the M&M shop.  Have you been to the M&M shop in Times Square?  Is it the candy or the wrapper that they're paying tribute to?  Oh, I have no idea.  The candy there, yeah.  It's the M&M shop, huh?  If you ever go to Times Square, if you ever get to New York City, go to the M&M shop.  You'll have a ball.  What's going on there?  Every color of M&M you could imagine.  Ooh.  And big, big, huge tubes.  And then you just...  And fill up your little baggy. 
[00:10:00]  Sounds unsanitary.  How is it unsanitary?  You can't get into the tubes.  You have to pull the lever, and then the M&M's fall out into your bag.  Okay.  I thought it was like some kind of grabbing of the M&M's.  Mm-mm.  Okay.  So we're like killing some time in there.  I'm into that.  And it's leading to my BlackBerry going off.  I got to communique from our own John Minnelli, program director of Free FM here in New York City.  We've been beating up on John pretty good the past few days. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Because he beats up on us through emails.  Yeah.  We have like a love-hate relationship with him right now.  I think he respects us.  We respect him, definitely.  But we're not really connecting right now whatsoever.  Yeah.  And we know we just have to follow our hearts.  But the emails are getting really, really funny.  Because yesterday, we're like, look, you got to tell us what's good about the show.  Enough with what's bad about the show.  Anthony and I know what's bad about the show before anyone else tells us. 
[00:11:00]  I would like to know some of the things that are working.  Some things that are working.  So not so we could do them 20 times exactly like we did them.  But get the basic gist of what's subject matter, the presentation of it, things that work.  That way we can build off of that.  Sure.  That's it.  So...  We don't need our asses kissed.  That's not what it's about.  It's about telling us what's working so we can continue on that road.  So you got the email in front of you.  The setup, Tom Chiasano came in here yesterday with his braces and bored the hell out of everybody with his Van Halen knowledge. 
[00:11:30]  Which, by the way, now I'm hearing he was wrong and I was right.  Now, according to Steve, one of his buddies at SoundScan or Polestar or one of those organizations...  One of Steve's buddies, though.  Steve, really fast, really fast.  What's the latest info on the Van Halen thing that Tom and I argued for what seemed like an hour yesterday?  It was about...  Two minutes?  Three minutes.  Yeah, okay.  Tom was wrong. 
[00:12:00]  Well...  They didn't have a very accurate track of album sales back in the 70s and 80s.  And according to SoundScan, Roth sold just over 5 million.  Hagar sold closer to 7 million.  Now, here's the problem.  That's because there was an accurate...  See, because my buddy taught me about stats.  Ah.  As soon as you said that they didn't have, you know, good keeping of the stats.  Yeah, with SoundScan back then, what does that mean?  It means that he could have sold more. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, could have, but according to actual records that people have taken...  Actual records.  Through SoundScan.  Doesn't he have two in the top ten of all time, Roth?  Yes.  Yeah.  Van Halen, the first album, and 1984 are both in the top albums of all time.  Then how could he just sell...  How could he just sell five billion albums?  Well, this is since they've been keeping track.  See?  No.  No.  Not buying it.  Yeah, now I don't know what to think.  How could two of the top-selling albums of all time equal less than 7 million?  It just does.  What? 
[00:13:00]  I don't know.  How could that happen?  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Bah, bah, bah, bah.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Just sing, Steve.  Bah, bah, bah, bah.  I was only joking.  Oh, all right.  Okay, Steve.  Thank you, Steve.  He's only joking.  Forget it.  It's not worth really getting into.  We're still just trying to figure out who sold more records.  David Jonathan Van Halen or Sammy Hagar.  This explains it.  The info that we just heard from Steve, it's from information he got off of Break.com.  Because he believes everything he watches on Break and YouTube and all those other sites. 
[00:13:30]  You cannot find a fake video as far as Steve's concerned.  Nothing's ever staged.  They're all real.  Yes, they are.  Yes, they are.  He still believes in the Blair Witch, by the way.  Oh, anything.  Wonderful documentary.  Shaky camera.  It's a wonderful documentary.  I feel bad for those women crying.  Yeah, the shaky camera proves this.  Exactly.  Does this.  So we had Tom in here, and I said, let's see John Minnelli critique Tom Chiasano. 
[00:14:00]  Tom's appearance.  And his appearance on the Opie and Anthony show.  So without further ado, here is the email from John Minnelli after yesterday's show.  This was it.  Greg.  Greg, CC'd with me, but Greg.  Hi, Greg.  You were wondering if I would say anything about Tom's visit this morning.  Obviously, what Opie just talked about.  Actually, when I started here, I admitted to him that I told you when you first came here 
[00:14:30]  that I thought you should keep his visits to a minimum.  Reason being, one, he's closely associated with Howard Stern.  Two, he usually came with bad news for the show.  John.  P.S.  Here's the P.S.  Listen to this P.S.  I think Simon, apparently implying that Seacrest is gay, is almost akin to a contestant taking 
[00:15:00]  a knife to Simon.  So I'm glad you talked about Idol.  See, he's referring to another email.  That's what would make Idol, you know, interesting to talk about.  Someone took a knife to Simon.  And I thought it was very entertaining.  I also loved Boardroom Jimmy, who doesn't.  That's just fantastic.  And Anthony's riff on poker players.  I guess how I was talking about how they all would rather look like professional poker players  than actually know how to play the game.  Yeah.  Or concentrate on the game. 
[00:15:30]  Uh, and then his last sentence, really liked the foot fetish segment, too.  That's why I wanted to read this email.  Yeah.  All right, John.  So I wrote.  Nice.  I wrote back to John, who knew that John Minnelli liked feet?  He's got that foot fetish.  Good old John Minnelli likes feet.  He liked the segment.  And why?  He said, I really liked.  Really liked.  Saved it for last.  Yeah.  That's like the end as on the credits. 
[00:16:00]  Basically, he can't help himself.  He's got to talk about feet.  Talk about feet.  Thank God they're talking about feet.  That means I can talk about feet.  Really liked the foot fetish segment.  Really did.  Boy, did that give me a visual last night.  I would suggest you guys do a foot fetish Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  You think he, like, sucks on feet while wearing that tie of his?  Not only on feet, but on the feet of a prostitute.  Oh, you think? 
[00:16:30]  A dead one.  Wearing a Clark Gable dinner jacket.  Whatever the hell he bought.  Gary Cooper.  Who did he?  Red Buttons.  He bought some dead guy's dinner jacket.  We know that much.  William Frawley.  They actually opened a coffin and took it off William Frawley.  Hey, Rick.  He walks around with a dead guy jacket that he's very proud of.  Whose was it?  Do you remember?  I want to say Spencer Tracy.  No.  I think it was Gary Cooper.  Was it Gary Cooper?  I'm going to go with Gary Cooper. 
[00:17:00]  Gary Cooper.  Maybe we should listen when he tells us these interesting stories.  Cary Grant?  Cary Grant.  Sure.  Why not?  Those two confused.  I think Spencer Tracy.  I don't know why.  Spencer Tracy?  Spencer Tracy.  I would have remembered that.  I don't know.  It was a famous guy.  So he's leaning over.  He's like, you know, caressing the foot and he's sucking on the toes.  That awful tie of his is getting in the way.  He's nude, wearing nothing but an awful sports coat and that tie.  Sucking the toes of an African-American.  Only African-American because prostitute of questionable gender. 
[00:17:30]  See, we got to talk about feet all day now for John Manelli.  Oh, isn't that horrible?  Just so he can like us.  Maybe we'll have girls call up and just talk about their feet all day long.  I really liked that segment.  That's exactly what he wrote.  I really liked the segment on feet.  Oh, John, I'll take a shower.  Oh, that won't be necessary.  No.  Ooh, a toe jam.  Keep the mud a little dirty.  You think he'd give us a little pedicure? 
[00:18:00]  Like he has a little pedicure set just waiting.  Waiting on his nightstand for that special night.  No, he carries around a little baggie full of cotton balls and things of that ilk in his pocket.  Ilk.  To put between the toes as he paints the nails.  Slowly.  P.S.  Please keep your feet a little dirty.  I like him that way.  He just corresponds through emails.  Like with everybody.  So he's got to do it with his female friends that he's got the foot fetishes with. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, wow.  This little piggy went to market.  This little piggy stayed home.  This little piggy had roast beef.  This little piggy had none.  And this little piggy went.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  His back probably looks like Denzel in glory.  Dirty John. 
[00:19:00]  Look at his computer, huh?  Do a search.  Just feet dot JPEG.  See how many hits you get.  Let's say hi to Rick in Michigan.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Rick.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I was just calling about your guys' little comment about New York and the whole, you know,  white devils and all that kind of stuff.  So I just visited there, and I didn't experience any of them or the statue guy, but about two  seconds on to Times Square with my mom, we got approached to buy some cocaine.  Wow, in Times Square? 
[00:19:30]  What year was this?  Huh?  What year?  What was I doing there?  What year was this?  Oh, this was last week, man.  Oh, last week.  Okay, because back in the day, that was normal.  Business as usual.  You couldn't even go a block back in the day.  You still get it in some of the places you go downtown.  You'll still get a few guys approach you.  Yeah.  He looked more successful than me.  That's the part that sucked the most.  He was.  The lucrative drug business.  What do you do?  Yeah, what do you do?  I'm a machine operator. 
[00:20:00]  Say?  Sell drugs, my friend.  Well, Ian and I are looking for some new drug mules, if you want to apply.  A mule.  I've done that before.  Oh, have you?  Now I'm doing the whole trying to be a member of society and work.  Going legit?  All right.  What are you working on?  A bridge port?  Huh?  What are you working on?  A bridge port?  The what?  I thought you were a machinist.  Yeah.  I paint bolts all day.  It's not a good existence.  Knows nothing.  I know.  You're really, really, really awful.  Awful caller.  Awful caller. 
[00:20:30]  Thank you, Rick.  Put him on the stamping machine.  Blindfolded.  All right.  We got lots to do.  The jacket, by the way.  This just in.  Gary Cooper.  James Cagney jacket, my friend.  James Cagney.  Yeah.  You dirty rat.  You sucked her feet.  He's got a dead guy jacket.  Dead guy jacket.  It's creepy.  James Cagney.  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.  That guy.  Why James Cagney?  Because that was the only jacket he could get.  I'm sure he'll let me know in an email. 
[00:21:00]  It's like some type of, like a tweed jacket, I think.  Isn't it?  Isn't it a tweed?  That's very tweedy.  Tweed went out when, pretty much when World War II ended.  Yeah.  I think everyone gave up their tweed.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We got Boardroom Jimmy making an appearance today.  We have Roland stopping by to play Hollywood Oscars Password.  I want to hear that.  We also have the brand new Hallmark cards. 
[00:21:30]  Travis went to a little card store yesterday and picked up the brand new Hallmark cards.  You've heard about these, right?  No.  You know, they decide to have a few more subjects.  Oh, a few more subjects on their cards?  You know.  They're not selling enough during every holiday and the addition of holidays and birthdays.  Secretary Day.  You got Valentine's Day.  Birthdays, right.  Sure.  Your anniversary cards, all that, right?  Well, new Hallmark cards deal with miscarriages. 
[00:22:00]  That's right.  Stop it.  You could get a card for someone that had a miscarriage.  Stop it.  For cancer.  Stop it.  And for being gay.  There's a card for being gay?  And Travis picked out some of the better ones.  I got them in front of me.  We'll have to read these a little bit.  Oh, you got quite a few.  Oh, my God.  Look.  He picked them out.  Yeah, I was drawer at home.  Wow.  Yeah, we got a lot to do. 
[00:22:30]  On a subject matter.  Also, we got the audio we asked for yesterday.  Some audio of Jackie, the knife girl.  Oh, goodie.  A little taste for the people that have never heard this.  A girl that likes having knives dragged across her nude body.  And it leaves nice scratches.  Yeah, little scratches.  No blood, just some scratches.  Just enough.  Because the knives are really, really sharp.  The sharper, the better for her.  And it makes her moan really, really loud.  You just gently hold onto the handle and drag it across her body.  And she moans and loves it.  And it leaves little scratches on her.  And if you don't feel like waiting for the audio, I don't blame you.

[00:23:30]  Right back into it.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  We have Penn in New Jersey.  What's up, Penn?  Good morning.  Funny MF-er, Mr. Norton.  Hi.  Ooh.  Good morning, O&A.  What's up, Penn?  Good morning, ma'am.  I got something you guys can think about for the rest of the day.  My big toe.  What's wrong with your big toe?  We want girls to call about their feet, not guys.  Yeah, what the hell are you doing?  I want to hear about my ingrown toenail with the moist pucks and dry blood that I get 
[00:24:00]  my stock every day.  I got to pull it off and kick it.  You got to drain your big toe every morning?  Every morning for about three months.  Not every morning, every day, every night.  Going through the day, sticking to my stock.  Why don't you have that tended to?  I don't have the time.  You don't have the time.  You're not going to have the toe.  I listen to you guys 24-7.  That thing is going to get infected. 
[00:24:30]  They're going to lop it off.  I let my dog lick it.  It gets clean.  All right.  Thank you, Penn.  We found out John Minnelli, the program director, he loves feet stories.  Yes.  Feet.  Foot stories.  Whatever.  It was in an email.  He likes the foot fetish thing.  I really liked the foot fetish.  So, we really need girls to call up today and talk about their feet for Mr. Minnelli.  Okay.  You want to pick a Hallmark card here?  Pick a card, any card. 
[00:25:00]  We got about 10 of them today.  But if you haven't heard, these are the new Hallmark cards.  I swear, this sounds like a radio bit, like a morning zoo would do.  Well, no.  They wouldn't get this outrageous where you write silly cards.  But these are real cards from the drugstore.  We've become a very touchy-feely society.  Certain things are best kept behind closed doors in private just to, you know, maybe  the family and friends can deal with it, but not with a Hallmark.  How impersonal.  If you want to send a note to somebody with an affliction or that it just had some kind 
[00:25:30]  of adversity in their life, wouldn't you handwrite a note?  Or at the very least, in another cold, cruel, insensitive manner.  Text message?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Text message.  Or something.  Like, Hallmark cards, any kind of cards, they've always been a little odd to me that  you're taking someone else's words.  And people have, you know, done bits on this and stuff.  Taking other people's words, and then you pick out one that kind of is similar to your 
[00:26:00]  situation and give it to them.  And then when people read the card, they go, oh, that's beautiful.  And they look at you like you wrote it.  Obviously, you didn't.  Some poet wrote it.  Well, we just got past Valentine's Day.  And, yeah, that's what everyone does.  You go up and down like, ah, this one says it all for me.  This says it for me right here.  But that's also the people that did a little advanced planning.  Now, I'm admittedly one of the worst people with cards.  I don't give cards to anybody.  I just don't remember. 
[00:26:30]  Mommies and girlfriends love cards.  You know something?  Me and my girlfriend have made a little arrangement about the card thing.  If we remember, if it's convenient for us, we'll do it.  If not, we don't.  And neither one really, you know, we don't care about that.  But relatives, I don't know.  I assume they would like to get a card from me.  They don't.  There have been times where I've had to run into a store, zero hour, and look through a ravaged card rack of nothing but crumpled envelopes. 
[00:27:00]  And one or two cards where I've had to go to the ebony collection and give my mother a, say, mama, you know, thank you for raising me without a daddy around.  And, you know, or it's got the loving couple.  I remember giving one to a girlfriend years ago where it had the loving black couple with the big natural afros.  It's like, yeah, baby.  I think the front said, yeah, baby. 
[00:27:30]  And you open it up, and it was, you know, some kind of thing for an ethnic couple.  Yeah.  But it was all that was left.  You know, I'm very bad with cards.  I go Spanish.  You do the Spanish?  Yeah.  Just, I figured, oh, I'm being silly, not lazy.  Very goofy.  I used to do gimmicky things like with my mother for her birthday.  I would get her a bunch of cards that added up to her age, but they were like for one years old and three-year-olds.  And, like, I'd get a bunch of those and sign them, like, with my left hand holding it like a brick and just write, like, to my mommy. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  You know, she'd be like, oh, that's adorable.  Well, this is.  Don't make a disgusted face.  I love my mommy.  I know you do, but just the adding up.  Yeah, I had to add up all the, I had to figure out mathematically or it's not funny.  It's not funny anyway.  Well, now you have a lot more reasons to get cards for all these things that are happening in your world.  And I brought up the Valentine's Day thing where you're looking and, you know, everyone does this and you find one that kind of says it for you, right? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Using that same philosophy, you have, like, let's say a friend that's losing their hair because of cancer treatment.  Are you going up and down that section and going, oh, this one right here says it all.  This one's perfect.  The one above it doesn't quite hit it quite right.  Do you get, like, because I know I do this, do you get the serious you have cancer card and then the funny you have cancer card? 
[00:29:00]  Because I know I usually like to get both for birthdays, you know, you get your girlfriend the nice sweet card and then you get a funny one that maybe has a little sexual innuendo there.  Hey, if you want to buy a cancer card, you know, God bless you.  But how much money does Hallmark need?  I think Anthony said it right.  You get a blank card and you write some nice little personal note in there if you really want to go down that road.  Oh, man, for something as sensitive as things that these cards that you're holding over there cover, perhaps a handwritten note to be delivered with some cookies and maybe a pat on the back and a kiss on the cheek. 
[00:29:30]  Or a bucket for them to throw up or a hat or a wig.  We've got, like, five or six different topics here.  Or an offer on their crib.  But here's the one we were talking about, hair loss during cancer treatment.  It's inappropriate.  Hair loss during cancer treatment.  Okay.  So you've got a buddy. 
[00:30:00]  I'm trying to move on.  I know you are.  A coupon for room repainting.  I'm just trying to save our jobs.  Let's move on.  It's Hallmark's fault.  It is Hallmark's fault.  All right, so you've got someone that's going through cancer treatment and they're losing their hair.  This is an actual card.  We did not write this.  You could go to your local card store and find this exact card.  Okay.  The front of the card, very orangey. 
[00:30:30]  Kind of...  It's like the color of your skin.  Kind of orangey.  Kind of like big fingerprint orangey.  Yeah, it's a little textured type.  Textured orangey card.  And it says on the front, no one said it would be easy to lose your hair.  But knowing you, you'll find a way to turn this situation around and use it as a badge of honor.  A sign to the world that your treatments are working.  There you go. 
[00:31:00]  Then you open it up and it says, and when this is all behind you and your hair grows back,  you'll be able to say with assurance that every day is a good hair day.  Ah, when your hair grows back, when this is behind you and your hair grows back, your nails will be growing too.  That'll be the only thing that'll be moving on you.  Because it's not going well.  Dot, dot, dot.  Sorry.  Permanent.  Yeah.  Bed head.  Let's go to Jeff the trucker.  Jeff, what's up?  Yeah, hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  A couple weeks ago, my parents, Collie, died, and my wife came home with a dead dog card, 
[00:31:30]  and I couldn't believe it.  I shook my head and walked away.  Is that a dead dog card?  You could get a dead dog card?  A goddamn dead dog card.  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem.  It was a sympathy card.  Can you read it to us?  I don't have it.  It's already mailed.  Oh.  I just saw it and laughed.  I couldn't believe it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Alicia in Michigan.  Alicia, what's up?  Hi.  Hi, Alicia.  Hi. 
[00:32:00]  Um, yeah.  You guys wanted me to call in about, like, feet or whatever?  Or whatever?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Our program director loves, uh, well, loved the section yesterday on, uh, foot fetish.  On foot fetishes.  Uh, why don't you describe yourself a little bit?  Okay, I kind of have a foot fetish myself.  But anyways, um, I got really pretty feet.  The only problem is, is they're really huge.  And we're, like, a size 11 and guys...  That's not...  But you sound like you're kind of petite.  Yeah, I'm, like, 5'9", and I have these huge feet. 
[00:32:30]  And it's, like, really hard for you to find dress shoes, because for, like, a chick in dress  shoes, it's, like, an extra whole size larger.  So then it's, like, I got to go to pay less.  So for size 12 women's high heel shoes, it's really bad.  Wow.  Wait, are you heavy?  No, actually, I'm not.  That's pretty sexy, actually.  I don't mind a girl with big feet if she's not...  If she's big.  If she was 5'2", you'd just look like a duck.  You want her to look like Big Bird?  No, no, no, no.  I look like a clown, man.  Walk around with big old... 
[00:33:00]  Clown shoes.  Clown shoes.  Yeah, just getting big clown shoes that explode.  Have fireworks in the front.  Pinwheels.  Mad magazine feet.  You ever see Mad magazine feet?  Yeah.  They all bend.  They bend.  And what...  So how old a girl are you?  I am 24.  24, so you stopped growing, thank goodness.  And are you all proportioned?  Yeah.  Your upper half and your lower half and your feet?  Yeah.  Man.  Wow.  And you have a foot fetish?  You go with guys that have foot fetishes and they like your big feet? 
[00:33:30]  No.  No?  What, guys don't like your big feet?  Or are you a lesbian?  My boyfriend does.  He thinks it's kind of funny.  He picks up on me all the time.  But he says if I ever needed to put a boot in his ass, I'd be the one to do it.  Mm.  Well, big feet joke.  Yeah.  Are they like nice?  Are they smooth?  Yeah, they're nice and smooth and everything.  And I paint my toenails black, so yeah. 
[00:34:00]  With a big roller?  Hey, what do you like about feet?  What do I like about feet?  Yeah, why the foot fetish?  We're trying to learn what that's all about.  We're trying to learn about our program director.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well, because I learned, like, I use some massage people and stuff that all your nerves  in your body is, like, actually all on your feet.  But when you rub somebody's foot, you're actually, like, making your whole body feel kind of  better.  It's kind of...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I never bought into that whole thing. 
[00:34:30]  Reflexology, right, you mean?  All right.  All right, Alicia.  That's about all we're going to get from you today.  We got a couple of laughs in, so we're going to move on.  Okay.  Thank you, Alicia.  We appreciate it.  Yep.  You ever buy into that whole thing?  No.  Because I've seen the charts where it's like, you're all these nerves and they show, like,  you're...  They show, in the arch, there's a big little, like, a square dotted line and it says liver.  It's like, touch here and make your liver better.  Or touch here for your head or ears. 
[00:35:00]  Right below the toe, that's for your ears.  How about just rubbing your ears?  You know where my sensitive area is?  My...  It's right there on my...  And that makes my brain very, very happy.  Right at the end of it.  You know why I don't buy into all that crap?  Because let's say you're just on the couch messing around with your girl's feet, giving  her a little foot massage.  Yeah.  You could be doing all sorts of damage.  Right?  You don't know.  You don't know?  I'm no professional.  What did I do? 
[00:35:30]  Right.  I just screwed up our liver and our kidneys.  Right.  One of our kidneys shut down.  I was just trying to give her a foot massage.  That's why I don't buy...  Because I've seen those charts, too.  And it's like, yeah, behind the little toe, it takes care of the pancreas and this and  that.  The pancreas.  Like, what if you're just messing with the little toe?  Are you shutting down that organ?  Are you helping it?  Now you screwed it up.  Are you helping it too much?  You made it go into overdrive.  Foot massage.  Yeah, all right.  No foot massage.  You could, man, a foot massage.  All right.  Pick another card, Jimmy.  I'll just throw you out the window.  Pick another card from Hallmark. 
[00:36:00]  The new Hallmark card.  There you go.  Pick a card.  All right, Jimmy.  What did you choose, Jim?  Of course you chose that one.  It looks like a lovely card.  The front of it has a little picture.  What it is, it's a very, like...  Silhouette-y.  Silhouette.  Very artistic photo of a child on a swing.  And the child is swinging forward.  You can't really see the child because the child's kind of in silhouette. 
[00:36:30]  And there's like the sun is kind of right in front of the child.  That's why the child is silhouetted.  So there's this bright white light.  I bet I know what this card's for.  Of course you do.  And the child...  There's a reason you can't see the child.  The child is swinging...  He's swinging in heaven.  Into the light.  Into the light.  Well, it's a sheet.  He's in heaven and...  It's Carol Ann.  He's on a...  She's on a swing.  Go ahead.  It's to parent...  This is the little post-it that somebody wrote to sum up with the card.  It's to parent dealing with troubled child.  Troubled child. 
[00:37:00]  Troubled.  Oh, okay.  And it says, children bring us a lot of joy.  But sometimes they bring heartache too.  Oh.  When you open the card.  I care so much about you and your family.  I'm thinking about you and hoping things will get better.  What an insult.  What an insulting card.  What a busybody mind your own goddamn business card.  Your kid has to really screw up if you get a card like that sent.  Don't kid him. 
[00:37:30]  That isn't like you got a C in math card and you send the troubled child.  That's your kid is in jail.  Or your kid's 15.  You haven't seen her in three or four weeks.  When she does show up, she's on crystal meth.  Crystal meth.  Just like...  Introducing you to her new boyfriend, Tyrone.  Tyrone.  Like, that's the card you get if you walked in on your daughter in that scene in traffic.  Oh, man.  Don't get me started.  Just pretty much get that card.  You know I love that scene.  Oh, that's a horrible scene. 
[00:38:00]  That is a horrible, horrible scene.  When Michael Douglas, right?  He's right at the door.  He's at the door.  He walks in and just sees that black drug dealer guy going at his little girl.  What did he do in that scene?  And she's all drugged up.  I don't know if he ever saw them actually having sex.  That was the beauty of the scene.  Well, he came to the door.  He was at the door.  Yeah.  The black dude, the really black dude.  I think he heard it.  They made sure he was a really black dude, by the way.  You know, Hollywood knows how to fool around with that stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And the really black dude is talking to Michael Douglas at the door. 
[00:38:30]  He's looking for his daughter.  Get out of here.  And little does Michael Douglas know is that right in the next room is his very white daughter.  Oh, yeah.  Completely naked in a drug haze.  She had just gotten...  Just railed by the very, very, very black guy.  Black drug dealer guy.  Yeah.  All right.  But that's when you send that card.  Oh, please.  You're so right.  Who would send that card?  Who would send that card?  You'd be a busybody, unless it was so blatant and obvious, like it's in the newspaper, that 
[00:39:00]  your kid's in jail for plowing over school children, drunk.  All right, Anthony.  And maybe.  Pick a card from Hallmark.  I'll go with the blue one here.  All right, Anthony.  Pick the...  These are the new Hallmark cards.  I thought I was safe with the blue one.  No, you're not safe with any of these.  It should have been pink.  Oh, I see what one you picked.  I should have known if you would have stuck all these colors out the...  See, one side is blue, and I thought it was basic blue.  If you would have stuck this side out, I'd have had a little more indication as to what  this card is about. 
[00:39:30]  And it's spelled blue.  B-L-E-W.  Yes, it is.  It's from the Robert Reed collection.  Well, this one, obviously.  Being gay.  Oh.  How?  One of the most difficult things we can do is to show our true selves to the world.  Yet, you found the courage to say, this is who I am. 
[00:40:00]  Open it up.  Smells.  There's no telling what changes will follow.  But living with the strength that comes from being everything you are brings its own rewards.  And you deserve all of them.  Not certain of the changes that will follow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rapid weight loss.  Yeah.  You lose your friends, and you're going to lose weight. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  At speed.  You're going to need the card that Opie read.  Oh, my God.  Once this sarcoma kicks in.  It should be one of those pop-up cards.  Like, you open it, and it's a closet with a person tipping out of it.  An angry dad shaking his fist.  A crying mom.  Yes.  A pop-up card.  It's a young lad leaving home.  His father's screaming at him out the window.  You get that card with the real estate section.  A pop-up card. 
[00:41:00]  That would be hysterical.  The closet opens.  The guy tips out of it.  And it's all in one nice motion as you open the card.  The real effeminate guy tips out of the closet as dad shakes his fist, and mom holds her hands up to her eyes  and shakes uncontrollably while she weeps, hoping for that grandchild she'll never have.  All right. 
[00:41:30]  We got a good one.  Oh, man.  We'll give this one to Travis.  Let me see.  Wow.  All right.  Some great phone calls coming in.  A lot of girls calling in with their feet.  Oh.  With their feet.  And we got more Hallmark cards on the way.  Yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  You are the driver infected.  What's up, Effers? 
[00:42:00]  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Tell a friend, will you?  It's the Opie virus spreading across America.  We're in the middle of talking about these new Hallmark greeting cards for some twisted things that happen to you and your loved ones.  Yeah, just some, you know, tragic events or just lifestyle issues.  Anthony nailed it, too.  If you're going to get into one of these touchy sets, get a card that's blank inside and write a little note. 
[00:42:30]  Some stationery.  Buy some stationery.  But you need Hallmark to find the words to show your sympathy because your friend has cancer.  It's kind of a cop-out.  Oh, the cancer section.  Nah, this one doesn't quite do it.  How big is that, too?  It's not like Mother's Day, that section, where it's real big.  I'm sure it's just like a little section.  It's hiding.  It's hiding in the shadows.  Yeah.  Are those little cards all together under, like, some kind of special...  Who bought them all?  You know, that's what we've got to figure out. 
[00:43:00]  Where are the cancer cards?  What are the cards right next to the cancer cards?  Is it the gay card?  Are they all, like, special interest cards all in one?  Gay cards right next to Happy Anniversary.  Miscarriage cards right next to You're Expecting.  Well, you don't want...  No, you don't want to put...  You don't want the miscarriage card next to the one first year card.  Right.  The card that's shaped like the number one with a candle on it.  Dude, can we go down to the store and rearrange the cards?  I want the miscarriage cards right next to the birthday cards, announcing that you're 
[00:43:30]  first birthday.  Oh, that's horrid.  Travi?  Hold on, hold on.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  Still.  Yeah.  What's up, Travis?  Travis?  Yes.  These cards now, where were they?  They were in a section all by themselves.  All by themselves.  Yes.  And were they prominently displayed? 
[00:44:00]  No, they were actually in the back of the store.  In the back of the store.  Yeah, because they don't want it.  They don't want these cards creeping anyone out.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be happy stuff when you're buying cards.  Did you ever go to the back of a store to, like, the far corner and see the crap they  got there?  Garbage.  They haven't been able to get rid of.  If you know anything about marketing, all the really good stuff is right there when you  enter a store.  Yeah.  But if you want to have fun, go to the back of these stores and look in the far corners.  I saw a show once where they were talking about supermarkets, and you don't even realize 
[00:44:30]  how cutthroat that business is.  The guys that supply, like, Del Monte and the name brand groceries, they will fight with  other people for shelf space.  That's at eye level.  The eye level shelf space, that's your prime real estate in supermarkets.  And there have been, like, payola issues in supermarkets where the suppliers actually  kick back money to the supermarket to have that placement.  Where's the John Jeff section? 
[00:45:00]  Oh.  Way low?  The lowest shelf?  That's, like, the lowest shelf that's real thin, too.  It's, like, only, like, six inches high, so you can't even see it.  Never mind reach for it.  It's, like, where the Goya beans are.  And we don't feel like explaining the John Jeff thing today.  On the floor.  We'll explain on another day for the newbies.  Yeah, how do you find a car?  I'm sorry your son is gay and the host of an awful show.  Oh, mate.  Yeah, that's going to be a great hallmark. 
[00:45:30]  Enjoy your trip to Thailand.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Inbred in Ohio.  Inbred.  Hey, what's up, y'all?  Hey.  Hey, man.  What's up, Inbred?  Hey, instead of a car for the gays, how about a singing telegram?  You have age.  You have age.  Yes, you have age.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have age.  You've got the age.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here.  It isn't clear, but what we're certain of is you have age. 
[00:46:00]  Yes, you have age.  Not HIV, but full-blown age.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  But full-blown age.  It's not HIV, but really full-blown age.  I'm sorry.  I wish it was something less serious.  But it takes you've got the age. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  That's a fantastic song.  I love that one.  Jimmy, you want to pick another card?  These are the brand-new Hallmark cards.  Oh, I don't know.  Real cards.  Pick a card, any card.  There you go.  This one can't be good.  These cards are just uncomfortable for everybody. 
[00:47:00]  Why would you send this card?  I don't know.  Yeah, it should be just personal drop-by with some cookies and cake.  Well, certainly not Similac.  This is a light purple card.  Any picture on the cover?  It's like a little dark purple, like, flower outline.  Yeah, it's like an outline of a flower with this blue, like, almost light at the top where the petals are. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  And here's what it says.  It is difficult for others to understand the depth of the loss we feel.  For the child.  How about three inches of toilet water?  How's that for a depth?  I was only joking.  All right.  It's okay.  I was only joking.  All right.  It's okay.  Oh, they mean by depth.  They mean the sorrow.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I was only joking.  I don't want to read this one. 
[00:48:00]  For the depth of the loss we feel.  For the child who will never be born.  Oh.  You would actually send this card to somebody?  Or you send these cards out to everybody?  That's horrible.  The poor parents are, like, you know, going through a tough time, and that's got to come in the mail?  Oh, what did I get?  A little card?  Oh, this might take my mind off of.  Usually when you go to your mailbox, and right around your birthday, or Christmas, and you see what's obvious, a greeting card, you get more excited inside. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, what's this?  You don't want to open up cards and read this crap.  Oh, no.  There's more.  It says, it's difficult for others to understand the depth of the loss we feel for a child who will never be born.  This is, even those closest to us may wonder why we can't seem to get over it.  Lovely friends.  Really?  This is, get over it.  What they don't understand, this is, you open the card, and it's like a light turquoise inside.  What they don't understand is how we already, ugh. 
[00:49:00]  How we what?  Let's move on from this bit.  Ah.  That's a good one.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  This needs to be read today.  What is Hallmark doing?  They need money this bad that they got cards like this?  What they don't understand is how we already loved that little one, and love never ends.  Oh, I didn't know it was an audio card.  You open it up, and it's an audio card.  Yeah, it's the thing of the future.  They put a chip in there.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Though the dreams and plans we had must be gently laid to rest, we each must take our own time 
[00:49:30]  and in our own way find the strength to let hope be a part of us once again.  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  It's all right now.  If you need someone to talk to, I'm here.  That is twisted.  I was only joking. 
[00:50:00]  We came up with a new way to use that clip.  Oh, no. 
[00:50:30]  What?  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  It's all right.  It's just a joke.  You guys can understand.  It's just a joke.  I was only joking.  There you go.  You're only joking.  All right.  It's fine.  Oh, my God.  I was only joking. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, wait a minute.  Okay.  Here it is.  The final mix.  Now, it's not the final mix.  The second?  Hold on in.  Not the final mix.  I'll help you. 
[00:51:30]  After the drum thing.  Give it to me.  Okay.  Okay.  Ah!  Ah!  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  It's all right.  Just...  Oh, brother. 
[00:52:00]  Look, the point is...  What is the point?  The point is...  There's no point to this.  Look, we'll agree to disagree, okay?  All right.  Let's just agree to disagree.  We'll agree to disagree.  We're really pissing off some people right now, and I don't blame them.  But the reality is, why...  What?  I'm just looking...  Okay, well, let's see.  All right.  Oh.  Ah. 
[00:52:30]  I hurt you.  I was only joking.  Oh, okay. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, we're only joking.  It's just a joke.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  Razzle-dazzle.  I just wanted to mix it up a little bit.  Sorry.  I just...  Whatever.  You're going to be okay. 
[00:53:30]  All right, look.  Let's...  I have to direct this.  It's going to go.  All right.  Am I in on this one?  Yes, you are.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You're fired. 
[00:54:00]  You're not suspended.  You're not on temporary leave.  You're fired.  All right.  Listen.  It's all Hallmark's fault.  Oh, wait, wait.  I was only joking.  All right.  I was only joking.  It's a joke.  It's fine.  All right.  The point is... 
[00:54:30]  That Hallmark is the twisted one here.  Can you dig that?  I'd do the chip card.  They actually have cards for these awful things.  All right.  How about we pick another?  I don't want to.  All right.  All right.  Well, maybe we should get rid of the other card.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:55:00]  John did want more sound effects.  Well, he got his sound effects.  There you go, Johnny boy.  All right.  Can we just...  Can I read this one really fast just to get rid of it?  Get it out of the way?  Get throw away?  Yeah.  Get this one out of the way.  Throw this one in the garbage with the other one.  Just clear the list.  All right.  It says, I have known you in my dreams, little one.  And there you will forever be loved.  Saying goodbye to what might have been the hopes and dreams that grew more real every day.  Brings in added sadness in the depth of pain. 
[00:55:30]  Wishing you gentle comfort for your sorrow.  Holy crap.  So that ends that subject.  There's a card for that.  Thanks to Hallmark.  All right, Anthony.  I got a couple more to choose from.  Fantastic.  Listen.  Listen.  Okay, listen.  I see the last three here.  Okay, listen.  Listen.  No, I'm not.  Kidding.  All right, listen.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  We really want a lot of listeners to our radio show. 
[00:56:00]  But if you're a female, I got a suggestion for you.  You might want to go somewhere else for another minute or two.  Because the last three are a doozy.  Boy, I wonder what the pink card is.  Here you go, Ed.  Here you go, Ed.  I was only joking. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Only joking.  All right, why don't you pick one?  Let me pick a new one.  Thank God we only have three of these Hallmark cards left.  All right.  I'm picking this one.  Oh, Christ.  No.  You picked the pink one.  Why did I have to pick the pink one?  Women.  Women.  Women.  Women.  Wake up. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Move on.  There's nothing to see here right now.  Move on.  Just move on.  Please leave.  We're telling you to leave.  Kiss my fat ass.  No, we're telling you to leave right now.  All right.  Pink card?  It's a pink card, yes.  We'll save the other two for later in the show because we can't.  All right.  This is a real Hallmark card, by the way, because people are writing going, you guys are making  these up.  No, you can go to your card store and find these exact cards. 
[00:57:30]  This collection is called Journeys.  It's encouraging words along life's way.  Okay.  So whether, you know, life does throw you those curve balls.  Oh, boy.  Do they have one for that?  I have them, but they curve.  You're a fighter, a survivor, an inspiration.  Oh, no.  And this is kind of ironic.  Keep that close to your heart now and always. 
[00:58:00]  Since something else isn't close to your heart anymore.  I was only joking.  Is that all the card says?  Yeah, that's it.  It's a simple.  It obviously is for breast cancer.  It's got the pink.  It's very subdued on the pink card.  You can see the pink ribbon.  That is the sign of support. 
[00:58:30]  I, sorry.  Can't think of anything funny.  No, boy.  Funny just slips by me on this.  Yep.  You know, my pop-up card idea is just going to go by the wayside.  Yeah.  The card is very lopsided.  Oh, it's not.  It's perfectly even both sides.  Look at it close.  No, man.  You can't even put that one on your mantle. 
[00:59:00]  It keeps falling over.  You know how you got to give it to the person?  Like this.  All right, listen.  Only this part.  All right, listen.  Let's leave.  All right, listen.  That was only joking.  Okay, it's all right.  It's just a joke.  Oh, sorry.  Everything's good now.  I try to put it back together.  All right, listen.  Give him half a card.  Oh, wow.  That is horrible.  Well.  Well, we got two more cards left. 
[00:59:30]  Have one for crying husband?  We have two cards left.  Yes, two cards left.  Thank God.  That we'll get to after the break.  Oh, damn it.  We also have, hopefully, Boardroom Jimmy checking in today.  I don't know if he's going to stop by.  Don't make a brief appearance because that can hurt people's throat.  All right.  And we also have Rich Voss and Bonnie.  They're going to join the show next.  We got a little game we're going to be playing with Roland today.  Yeah, I'm excited about this. 
[01:00:00]  It could either be great or completely awful, just like Roland.  Look at us doing bits like Preston and Steve.  Yeah, we rule.  We're good.  That's horrible.  You can't.  Oh, my God.  People are making up their own cards, and they're really awful.  Yeah, well, there's other stuff to do, too, but I forgot already.  What, what, what?  What do you got?  This one says, sympathy card. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  It says, in deepest sympathy, I'm sorry to hear your daughter a...  Hey.  What a Negro.  I thought the beep took care of it.  Isn't it?  You open a card.  It's a pop-up card.  You open it, and there's like a nice suburban house, and a black python just falls out of  the daughter's window on the card.  Isn't it an audio card? 
[01:01:00]  Don't you have the audio of that card there, Anthony?  Oh, you might...  Hey, where are the white women at?  No, that ain't it.  No, that ain't it.  Do you have the audio?  Of course I do.  For the audio card of the card you just read?  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down slut.  It is not a sin to get rid of a dirty stain.  Wasting your time with a black...  Huh.  A Negro.  Oh, my God.  Anyone else see Jim Carrey doing the David Caruso bit on Letterman? 
[01:01:30]  Like, six months after the whole world did the bit?  Hello, exactly!  Yeah.  How does he get away with that?  And everyone's laughing and laughing and laughing like it hasn't been done by pretty much everybody  at this point.  I mean, everybody.  And he walks on to Letterman with the glasses and does the whole David Caruso one-liner bit.  Yeah, it's pretty, um...  Pretty, uh, hack now.  It's one of the videos that is, uh...  It's one of the top videos on, I think, YouTube.  Sweeping the nation.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:02:00]  Lots to do today, so get us out of here for a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Still to come.  Yeah.  Rolling.  Doing, uh, Oscars...  Password.  We're gonna try something new today.  People are going, Oscars, Password?  How...  What is...  I've never...  More like, uh, the $25,000 pyramid.  It's more like...  You're right.  It's $25,000 pyramid. 
[01:02:30]  I'm sorry, Anthony.  You're right.  I had the wrong game show.  But even that, it's...  It's so revolutionary.  Ooh.  That, uh, I don't think people even understand what it is yet.  All right.  Well, basically, you're right.  Uh, he's gonna pick a movie out of a hat.  Yeah.  A movie that is nominated for an Oscar.  Yep.  And then he's gonna, uh, just, uh, use words to describe it, and we gotta try to figure  out what movie he's talking about.  But that's how he reviews movies.  Now, you might be sitting there going, boring.  Yeah, you're right.  But with Roland, you're not right.  When, uh, you ask Roland to describe a movie that he's seen... 
[01:03:00]  He's so vague all the time.  Yeah.  Like, he sees a movie, and he'll be, um...  Like, what...  Yeah, yeah.  How was the movie, Roland?  Oh, great.  Well, what was great about it?  Um, acting.  Action.  Drills.  Um, stunts.  It's like he's sitting there on the $25,000 pyramid.  Yeah.  Just trying to, um, pass.  So we'll give it a shot.  Whatever.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:03:30]  Hey, uh, Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Pop quiz, sir.  Pop quiz.  Pop quiz.  Some of the words that we like saying on the Opie and Anthony show.  Um, Neil.  Neil Burtz.  Very good.  King Cullen.  Good.  Waldbaum's.  Waldbaum's.  And, uh, oh, Christ, what was the other one?  There's two more.  Two more.  Two more words we love saying on the Opie and Anthony show.  You got it.  Come on, Jimmy.  Come on.  Come on.  Fatso.  Fatso, right? 
[01:04:00]  Uh.  Uh.  What are they talking...  Who's mumbling back there?  I can hear you guys mumbling.  Gotta be E-Rock.  Trust me, we're not that good.  That would...  Wait.  You guys just...  All right, whatever.  What was my other word?  Huh?  Oh.  Why are you helping him out?  Wow.  Nathaniel.  No.  Yes, it's Nathaniel.  He's a queer.  Queer.  Right. 
[01:04:30]  Hoping to add more, uh, words to the list that we like saying.  I think I have one.  You do?  Yes.  All right.  Improv.  No, that's where you're going to be performing over the weekend.  Very good.  Addison, which is a suburb of Dallas, blah, blah, blah.  All weekend long, though, right?  Tomorrow, tonight through Sunday.  They're great down there.  They love little Jimmy Norton down there.  It's a great place.  There's all like nothing but disgusting massage parlors.  I love Dallas.  It's filthy.  I've seen Jimmy and Dallas at least two times.  Maybe three times.  We're like an alternative couple. 
[01:05:00]  Two lonely men getting on a plane.  I've got a card for you.  Yeah, I've got a card here.  There.  Sorry you're off the air and gay.  We gave it to each other.  In 2003.  What?  Like.  Well, we would travel the country together.  We were off the air.  It was a little depressing.  Where's your headphones?  Yeah.  Sweetie.  We've got Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio here.  Your haircut looks weird.  It's not bad.  You look bad.  I just got a card yesterday.  We went and had our nails done together and I got my hair cut.  What did you look like?  What?  Me?  Caesar? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  I bring you news from the door.  It's like Caesar, yeah.  That's like the early Clooney.  I kind of like it this way.  I said, look, I got 15 minutes.  Make me as gay as you possibly can and let me get out of here.  It is kind of gay.  I thought you were talking about your career.  I got 15 minutes and they're over.  You got your nails done?  You do that a lot?  No, I used to and then I let them go.  You know, once I quit smoking, I started kind of like biting them a little more.  Just picking on them and then I let them go.  But yesterday, you know, just to keep her company and pretend things are still going well, I went and sat with her like a friend. 
[01:06:00]  I did it once as a goof and it was just really boring.  There was nothing to it.  I could care less what my nails looked like.  It wasn't pleasurable or nothing.  And the Asian lady goes, you know, I want a massage.  I don't want a massage.  I don't like them touching me.  Like when I get my hair cut, they go to wash my hair.  I go, can you please do it as fast as possible?  You don't like the scalp massage?  Are you kidding me?  What did you say to that lady?  It all depends.  The place I get my hair cut, I'm convinced she's hitting on me at this point. 
[01:06:30]  It all depends.  It all depends how she massages my scalp and my neck and my shoulders.  Don't want a guy shampooing your hair.  No.  Because some salons have a guy that does the shampooing and it ruins the entire experience.  I sit there and my shoulders are up by my ears and I'm just like, get this all the way.  Get it done.  Get it done.  Get it done.  And then when there's a girl doing it, not even that it's a sexual thing, but it's just so much more relaxing 
[01:07:00]  to have a girl massage your scalp like that and wash your hair.  What's wrong with the guy doing it?  Shut up.  First of all, I even told this girl, I said, can you wrap it up already?  Because I get too tense or something when they're just...  Why?  Why?  The girl's fine.  Huh?  The girl's fine.  It's nothing sexual.  It's like nice and relaxing.  It's like a little scalp massage.  But when a guy's doing it, it's just got to get it over with.  I guess it's a prison rape.  Rich likes when a guy shampoos his hair.  I don't like anybody just touching me.  You're disturbed when a girl does it, so you got to like it when a guy does it. 
[01:07:30]  When he massages my hair?  Yeah, yeah.  You're turning into a psychopath.  You do know that.  No.  Don't massage me or touch my hands.  What's the matter with you?  Well, you know, you go there.  It's a manicure.  I don't like when they touch my hands.  They have to.  She goes, I'll do lotion and lotion your hands and stuff.  Well, but why are you there?  Just to do my nails.  I don't want to massage them yourself.  You just want to buff.  Come on.  How can they do your nails without holding them, though?  I went to her.  We had a spa thing.  What?  No, I heard something. 
[01:08:00]  Bill Maher had a makeup artist that said that she wasn't allowed to touch his face.  Like she couldn't actually touch his face.  Really?  Just the makeup could touch it?  Yeah, just the...  She could only use her left hand.  Everyone's weird.  That's good.  Huh?  The problem is you're afraid of any human contact because you're a lunatic.  How about...  There's nothing wrong with non-sexual human contact.  Well, no, no, because when I used to go to certain types of meetings...  There's nothing wrong with sexual human contact, either.  When I used to go to certain meetings, right, and they would come up, oh, give me a hug. 
[01:08:30]  Don't...  I don't know.  I'm a hug.  If I knew how to hug, I wouldn't be in these meetings.  Well, there you go.  You know, don't hug me.  I want to hug.  Get off of me.  Did you ever hug to get drugs?  Huh?  Did I ever hug?  I did a lot more than that, I bet.  Did you ever get...  Well, he was hugging, but it was the back of a gentleman's legs.  And the gentleman was hugging the back of your head.  I don't know.  I'm just not into it.  Why did I make that so obvious?  You're a whole touchy and...  All right, listen. 
[01:09:00]  We got a quick Britney thing.  This thing is making its way around the internet.  Is it?  I don't know.  Let's listen and see if it's good or not.  From the people who brought you Chia Pet and the Chia Tree, it's Chia Brit.  Br-br-br-br-Britney.  Just smear our special Miracle Grove, add Red Bull, and watch Britney go from shorn to  reborn.  I'm back, y'all.  Wow.  It even works in two places.  Look at that bush.  Available at Hyde.  Oh. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  Oh, my.  I tell you something.  How did that not go in?  I was only joking.  There's nothing I can say today  Now that's going to be half the bad  Awful  I get it  Because she's shaved her head  Way to go for the obvious one  How about using some  Clever  I guess she's not going to do Saturday Night Live with Dice now 
[01:10:00]  Alright  That's a good reference  20 years old  Nora Dunn  Oh  Bonnie's belly's growing  You see that  What  Huh  What beer  There's a dumb little slobbering baby in there  Oh my god  We got a card for that  Oh no  Thank god that we did the last segment  Before you got in here

[01:11:30]  Well the ultrasound shows  They're already bigger than ours  How far  Yeah  This is good news  I'm almost five months  Very close  Are you showing  Oh wow  Yeah  Are you kidding me  Let's see  Whoa  Hey there's a baby  Yeah  That's like one of those guts  You guys have the same gut  Because you quit smoking  Oh look at how Rich is in salt  Rich is in salt  He's sucking it  You're sucking it  You're sucking it in

[01:20:00]  It's Jackie  A girl  Used to come into the studio  Way back when  About five  Six  Seven years ago  I don't even know anymore  But over at  N.E.W.  When we run over there  And she has a fetish  She likes knives  And not only  Likes to look at them  And touch them  But she likes having the blades  Dragged over her body  You know  You loosely hold on  To the wooden handle  She liked like a bread knife  A serrated bread knife  Which is really  Really sharp  Really sharp  And you don't need  Much pressure 
[01:20:30]  And you'd loosely  Hold the handle  And drag it  All over her body  And it would leave  Little trails  That look like  Cat scratches  All over her  And she would  She'd love this  I hope she doesn't  Go out with Josh Blue  Oh  I'm not even  I'm not even  Going to  Acknowledge that  It wasn't bad  It did her something  Josh Blue is the  Comic that has the CP  Yeah  So he's moving around a lot  Oh see  Okay  So the knife would  Really  I didn't  I didn't 
[01:21:00]  That was a very good line  If people knew  Who Josh Blue was  Yeah  It took too long  To  Yeah  Yeah  Access  You should have said  Hepburn  Or Ali  Ah  Michael J. Fox  Michael J. Fox  Would have been a good one  Ali  Don't you  Muhammad Ali  Would have been a good one  Abstract  You know what I mean  Hepburn  Hepburn  If she was holding it  In her teeth  Maybe  Yeah  Not a good one  Not a good one  How about Reagan  We dig him up  And he could be in the joke  Well  Sorry fatso 
[01:21:30]  Hey  One of the words  You like saying  Fatso  Hey  Fatso  You might ask  Why are we playing this  Okay Ralph  Well we're playing this  Because you know  Britney Spears  Crazy chick  Crazy chick  She left for rehab  By the way  Everyone's talking  About that today  And we want to try  To do crazy chick day  Yeah  We want to have  Crazy broads up here  So we figured  We'd break one out  From the archives  To maybe motivate  Some of these women  To come in  To do their  Crazy chick stunt  For us  You know what  I think we need to  I think we need 
[01:22:00]  Guys or girls  That know crazy chicks  Yeah  To bring them in  Yeah  Because crazy chicks  Probably wouldn't come in  But you can bring them in  Because you ever  Talk to a crazy chick  That just like  Rambles on about crazy stuff  Yeah  That's fantastic  That would be cool too  That is great too  Where they're just talking  About things  And you're like  What the hell  Are they talking about  Yeah we don't  You don't need to do anything  That nuts  Doesn't have to be a crazy stunt  You just gotta sound crazy  Alright well here's  A little clip from  Jackie the knife girl  Let's see when he gets

[01:24:00]  I ruined it  What a way to end though  Bravo  I'm listening to that clip  We're back live  And we didn't ask  Many questions  Back in the day  Guy wanted to come in  With really sharp knives  With his chick  And she gets off  By having the knives  Just kind of  Dragged across her body  Gently cutting her skin  And that was good enough  For us  We didn't ask anything  I didn't care  He could have just  Murdered her live  On the air  Would have been great  Imagine like right  In the middle of it  He just plunged it  Right into her chest

[01:25:30]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Dylan! 
[01:26:00]  You're an ass!  Everyone's mesmerized!  Dick!  Everyone jumped!  God damn, was that funny!  What the hell, did we change roles today?  It wasn't me, you can't remember me! 
[01:26:30]  You ruined it!  Oh no!  You ruined it!  Alright, we're back live.  I ruined everything.  Just when I was getting good, Anton was just messing with the girl.  The video's up on opianthony.com, it's amazing.  It really is.  We got like, I don't know, like ten of those videos or something.  She was in all afternoon.  Have we contacted her or no?  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't. 
[01:27:00]  It's probably like, what do you do?  Oh, I'm a stay-at-home mom.  I just love the life I'm leading now.  Oh, that was ages ago.  Oh no, I haven't done that in years.  Yeah, we did try to call some of the chicks from the old days when we first got back on radio.  Yeah.  We just heard horrific things.  Well, I just got, it's me and the kids.  I love the kids.  You know how that's going to happen, Bob.  Well, I just had triplets.  I had triplets, so I got my hands full.  But I could come up and do your show again. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, that moan.  Rich going to walk around with the little playpen thing you got to walk around with everywhere?  What's that?  I can't wait to see you.  Well, what's that?  It's called being a dad and having to do things.  You know something you did 20 years ago?  Before they had all those things?  When you just put a kid in the front seat and use your arm as the seatbelt?  Bonnie's going to, like, get one of those doubles.  You in the back, the baby in the front, you're going to push both of you around.  Bonnie, you do know this is completely life-changing and, like, that's it. 
[01:28:00]  Why?  Because all of a sudden you have to, like, have responsibility.  We're not going to be good parents.  Oh, okay.  No.  All right.  At least, see, that's honesty.  Not going to be good.  We're just going to leave home alone.  Tweezers near the socket.  Try to keep it alive.  That's a good thing.  You set the bar low like that and you can only, there's no disappointment.  A lot of times, you know, if the kid has a hard life, they go on to do great things. 
[01:28:30]  So, you know, I want to give them that.  Got to give them a good story.  Right.  All right.  We have to take a break.  Our communique coming in.  YouTube sucks.  Another reason why YouTube sucks.  They removed No Filter Paul's accounts because he uploaded the first two Jackie the Knife  girl clips and we loaded up two clips where she's not even nude.  Just knives, brawn panties, and moaning.  And they not only got rid of those videos, they got rid of his entire account. 
[01:29:00]  YouTube sucks.  Get break.com in here.  That moaning was great.  Why didn't Paul, something that questionable?  Because now we know, we've known for a while YouTube sucks.  They just, something that questionable, you should make a new account.  Just stop with the, if you have 200 videos, now it's at this point.  I'm issuing a statement to everybody that puts O&A videos on YouTube.  If you have an account with 200 videos on it, 100 videos, and you put something even questionable 
[01:29:30]  on there and they remove your account, I don't want to hear it because you're an idiot.  You're the idiot.  Get a million different accounts.  Make another account, put it on there.  So you save your other videos.  So you save it.  You know, this has happened how many times now?  Did you take the remove my account?  It's the eighth time this has happened to eight different people.  But they have no problem showing the latest Lonely Girl 15 clips.  Enough of her.  How many times can you jack to that anyway?  Stop.  A lot.  They're trying to do a new thing with her and a house and I don't know. 
[01:30:00]  It's all fake.  They're trying to make a movie.  She's 45 years old.  She's young.  All right, listen.  She's young.  When we get back.  Yes.  We have the final two.  Ooh.  Yeah, okay.  Barney, you could stay in for this.  Good.  I'm looking at the cards.  The new Hallmark cards for some very, very touchy subjects.  We got the last two we'll do after the break.  And Roland with the pyramid game.  Yes, we got to get to that.  Is he here? 
[01:30:30]  Yes.  All right, we'll do that next as well.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio.  We got Jim Norton leaving for Addison. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, the improv tonight through Sunday in Texas by Dallas.  In the Dallas area, of course.  And by the way, can I point out that Rich had an interesting point?  Yeah, go ahead.  You actually made sense about where you want to start sleeping.  What do you mean it makes sense where I want to start sleeping?  Oh, my God.  Don't bring this up.  Wait, what happened?  Oh, what I was talking to Rich about.  It actually made more sense than Bonnie doesn't think it makes sense about.  Go ahead.  That I was, like, checking into, you know, like, how they have storage garages in, you know, storage. 
[01:31:30]  Like, I used to have a storage garage in Jersey.  It was, like, 50 a month.  Then I saw storage garages in New York.  So you figure if you get a place for, like, 100 a month, right, and you put a couch or something in there.  Yeah, I see where this is going, yeah.  You have a couple hours.  You want to kill time.  You just go.  Instead of getting hotels, you just hang in the thing.  It's like a walking garage or something.  You know what I mean?  You.  Let me translate that.  He wants to get a storage unit as a crash pad.  Right.  In New York. 
[01:32:00]  A storage unit.  I'm not saying, because, you know, you're not going to rent an apartment if you only come in.  But if you say you've got an audition and you've got three hours to kill in between or something.  So you've had one audition in the three years I've known you.  Let me just do some math.  What about, like, I'll just pick one problem out of a hat here.  What about a heat?  That's one I didn't even bring up.  There's countless more. 
[01:32:30]  No, there isn't.  Oh, yeah, I know.  They have lights in them.  You put a fan.  You can put a light in.  You know how the lights you put in, a socket with a heater.  Oh, that's good.  Not with a heater.  Why don't you just bring in a barbecue and shut the door?  Why don't you back up your car while you're at it?  Yeah, back your car and just pump the exhaust in.  Yeah, because that's warm.  I just mentioned it to her, like, all of a sudden I'm crazy.  I mentioned it 50 times.  That is crazy.  He got a little obsessed with it.  You also know that the owner of said facility would probably frown on people crashing in their little storage spaces. 
[01:33:00]  So I said he'd always have to come up with an excuse.  You know, I've got to go through those pictures again.  It's going to take me a few hours.  Obviously, I'm not going to do it.  Obviously.  Now you're not.  I was never going to do it.  He'd be calling his boss.  That boss, the fat guy's here again.  Every time I talk, there's an echo.  All right, listen, we've got to move on because we've got Roland standing by. 
[01:33:30]  He wants to do this $25,000 pyramid thing.  Park your car in there with a head in it.  What if you do in the bathroom?  All right.  We talked about this.  We got the audio.  Jim Carrey, the last person to do the David Caruso bit.  We did it.  Who else did it?  Greg Ferguson, I think, was doing it.  David Caruso did it.  Everybody was doing it.  The video was up on YouTube and break as a montage.  Very funny.  And finally, Jim Carrey thought he should do it on Letterman and bring it to everyone's attention. 
[01:34:00]  We've got a nice, real, intense close-up here.  Okay.  David Caruso.  David Caruso.  Well, I guess we've found our man. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  He's kidding, right?  He makes like $20 million a picture.  Still?  Well, not on this last one.  I think he took a little pay cut.  He's getting $23.  Yeah.  He used to be an English teacher.  Uh-huh.  I before E.  Yeah.  Except after C. 
[01:35:00]  Played a part where Rogan runs up on stage and yells, right?  So, it's yelling at him.  It's a psychopath.  It's kind of creepy because everyone has seen this done already.  Like a million times.  Oh, it's funny.  Very nice.  I hear he's doing cartoon voiceovers.  Cartoon voiceovers.  I wonder what that would be like. 
[01:35:30]  I did.  I did.  I did to you, putty tat.  How many of these are there, by the way?  No, we're done.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It went on all night, but we're done.  Holy Jesus Christ.  But isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  Is he making believe no one saw this on every other show?  Even on our dopey radio show?  Do you know how many people across America were probably turning the televisions off in their storage facilities? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, television, yeah.  All right, well.  Bring one in.  20 million a movie.  Well, there you go.  He's innovative, that Jim Carrey, I've got to tell you.  We've got two cards left from Hallmark, the new Hallmark cards.  These are real cards that Travis went out and got.  They decided to expand and try to make more money.  It's all about money.  They went into some areas where I believe it would be more sensitive to just write a card yourself. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  They take out some of your stationery, your nice cross pen, and jot down a little message to somebody who's grieving or just one of these situations that they're making a card for.  It seems a little inappropriate for Hallmark to just stamp out a card that's about something so sensitive.  And some of the cards we read already this morning, one for miscarriage, one for hair loss due to cancer treatment.  Cancer.  We had the breast cancer one.  The breast cancer one.  You're gay. 
[01:37:00]  You're gay.  And you're coming out.  That was the pop-up card Jimmy was talking about.  Lovely pop-up card.  Wouldn't they just say sorry about your cancer?  Now they're going to start going sorry about, you know, the effects.  It was, yeah, sorry about the hair loss.  It's like, I'm not really worried about the hair loss.  I'm worried about my liver being eaten away.  Yeah.  This is the one for a troubled child.  This is one for a troubled child.  Yeah, a troubled child.  And they got little rhyme schemes, too, just like all the other cards.  No.  I swear to God.  All right.  Jimmy, you want to read one of the last two? 
[01:37:30]  I can see that one's orange and one's purple.  So I don't know.  He's taking the orange one.  Orange with a little flower on it.  A little flower.  A little flower.  See the front?  That flower is on a lot of them.  Mm-hmm.  It's an orange.  Cart.  Orange.  It's orange.  And it has a little flower that raises up.  It's really pretty.  Yeah, it's covered in, like, plastic that, like, Grandma has over her couches, kind of  plastic, to protect the little actual cloth flower.  You know what's creepy about that plastic that's covering the card? 
[01:38:00]  There's a little note inside, I swear to God.  It says, remove the plastic before you put in an envelope.  Why?  I don't know.  Oh, it's supposed to protect the flower?  I guess.  Yes.  All right, Jimmy.  I wish I could make things happen for you the way you want them to.  I know how much a child would mean to you.  Ah.  I'm still hoping and believing for you and keeping you in my heart. 
[01:38:30]  Too bad you're shooting blanks.  I made the last line up.  Get out of here.  Someone stop him.  He's incorrigible.  Now I get the pull the plastic off the card bit.  Was that an actual thing?  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  Because, oh, I thought you were joking.  No, it has a little note.  Obviously, perhaps what the gentleman should be doing is pulling the rubber off of whatever  he's...  Yeah, pulling the plastic off something else.  Remove wrap before placing an envelope.  Is that what you're saying? 
[01:39:00]  He should actually take that as advice.  That's the problem they're having as a couple.  Remove the plastic.  Not removing the wrap.  And they're speaking in double...  Double entendre there.  The envelope.  Remove the plastic before you put it in the envelope.  In the envelope.  And look at...  You missed this.  Look at this little thing on the back here.  It says, do not throw card in her face and hair.  You got to handle these things sensitively.  Very sensitive.  I hold in my hand the final card. 
[01:39:30]  No Johnny Carson?  All right, here.  The final card.  There's...  All right, wait.  I got some...  Oh, God.  I got some music for this one.  I love the first line.  Wait, open up the card.  This must be about...  It's an audio card.  So you just opened up the card.  Well, first of all, tell me if I'm right or wrong.  This has to be about divorce.  I just read the first line and dealing with my divorce, I know it has to be. 
[01:40:00]  It says, talk about a C word.  This is the actual card, yes.  And it says C word.  It says, talk about a C word.  So I'm thinking of my ex right now.  There's only one C word.  Yeah.  Totally.  Uh, crummy comes to mind.  Wish you weren't feeling that way.  But some good words start with C. 
[01:40:30]  Like courage.  You have lots of that.  Comfort.  You're wished a bunch.  And caring.  You're surrounded by it.  Don't forget coughing.  Don't forget...  I don't understand.  Oh, God damn you.  It's a cancer card.  Yes, it's C.  The C word is cancer.  See, you know why?  You can get a cancer card thanks to Hallmark.  You might think, like, just looking at it, you might think, like, how... 
[01:41:00]  You know, this is a little vague, but if you have it, I think you know what it means.  I think it's like, what could they possibly mean?  Does the doctor give that to you?  That's how you find out.  That's what I'm saying, that the doctor gives it to you.  There should be a bill in there.  That's what I'm saying.  Leave it to the Jew.  There should be a bill in there.  Charge him.  Come to my office.  It's in a storage facility.  C for coughing.  Oh, God. 
[01:41:30]  Doesn't chemo storage C, too?  Yeah.  I think you're right.  Cough up blood.  You're right.  Oh, boy.  And caring.  That's wonderful.  C word.  All these cards just remind you of what you have.  Yeah, we're getting pretty sick with these cards, obviously, but how sick is Hallmark  for putting these out there?  And it's, yeah, you think if you were close enough with somebody that you know about their 
[01:42:00]  condition, you're concerned about it, you write off a card in your own hand about, you  know, hey, I'm here for you or whatever.  But to say, talk about a C word, crummy comes to mind.  That's like if you hurt your elbow at the softball game.  Yeah.  Ow, this feels crummy.  I got a cold.  That's pretty crummy.  Crab.  You know, cancer isn't quite crummy.  It's, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, right.  When cancer comes to mind, that's it.  Jeez, and crummy isn't the word.  Crummy is like you were supposed to bring your kid to Toys R Us and you didn't feel like 
[01:42:30]  doing it.  Oh, man, that's a crummy thing to do.  After a few Saturday nights, I know a few beers, I felt a little crummy the next day.  There should be a card after that card saying, sorry, I gave you that card.  Sorry for the lousy Hallmark card I gave you.  It was very insensitive.  C is also for crackers and chicken soup.  That's all you'll be eating.  And crummy is your shirt when you can't quite finish what you're eating.  You're too weak.  The cancer card should be a series of cards that start really, really small and get bigger 
[01:43:00]  and bigger.  Oh.  Send one every week.  That should be it.  We hope this is growing on you.  Oh.  There should be a funny one.  Because I was saying before, you know how you have the serious card?  And for Valentine's Day, you get the serious lovey-dovey card and then the funny card.  Yeah.  So you can have one like this, and especially if they have something like a brain tumor,  let's say, which would be awful.  You have one like this, and then you have another one that says, sorry about your brain cancer. 
[01:43:30]  And you open it up, and it's that lettering that looks blurry.  It's really not.  Or the series of just printed that way.  Or the cancer cards, a series of cancer cards.  The first one has just the little words, and they just keep getting bigger.  More and more and more words.  Oh.  Very wordy by the end of it.  Or they should have a speaking card.  Sorry about your brain.  You open it up.  Oh, sorry to me, Revaldo cancer.  That is crummy. 
[01:44:00]  That is crummy.  How about a pop-up card where, like, when you open it, there's a smiling guy, but as  you open it, the hair comes off, and the smile is a frown.  Or the cancer card.  At least you're not black.  Hold on, Rich.  Hold on.  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  It's all right.  It was just a joke.  Cancer card.  How horrible.  That is, it is, it is horrible. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, did we throw this away?  We didn't need to.  We got them all?  Yeah, they're right here.  Except for the, uh...  Yeah, we gotta get these online.  There's one that isn't in good shape anymore.  There's one that's only half of it.  There's one that's just anymore.  There's the one.  They actually made a...  Oh, they're over here.  ...for breast cancer.  They had what?  They had a breast cancer card.  Yeah.  Only...  Really?  Yeah.  Show them the breast cancer card.  Something happened to it, though.  It's in two parts.  I know.  It got ripped in half.  It got, uh...  Horrible.  Just take one half, read it, take the other half, and throw it in the dumpster at Sloan 
[01:45:00]  Kettering.  Oh, my God.  What?  You always had bad boobs anyway.  The breast cancer card should be one of those cards that just doesn't open.  It's just, uh...  You know those cards?  They're, uh...  There's no inside there.  Suzanne Sumner's resume's on the back of this.  Suzanne Sumner?  Yeah.  Wait.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're so wrong on everything.  Why?  Suzanne Sumner. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Break this down.  What?  Who did you mean?  Who had the...  Uh, didn't she have the breast cancer?  Suzanne Sumner's?  Oh, yeah.  I don't think Suzanne Sumner or Sumner's or Sumner's had breast cancer.  She had cancer or something.  I don't...  Who had the breast cancer?  Did she?  Olivia Newton-John?  Olivia Newton-John did.  But the one with the thigh master?  She treated herself.  Sumner.  She...  What?  She treated herself, and then she wrote a book about...  She did? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  How do you treat it yourself?  Who did?  Carrot enemas.  Suzanne Sumner?  Carrot enemas?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That worked.  The other day, Rich goes, how do you spell clope?  I go, what's a clope?  Oh, no.  He goes, you know, you put it over your shoulders.  A clope.  Clope and dagger.  A clope?  Oh, my God.  I played Scrabble in it.  You're a dope.  Oh, you really are as dumb as they come.  It's mind-boggling.  Oh, we love it.  We can't get enough of them.  He's a dope. 
[01:46:30]  Clope.  Oh, my God.  Well, you must be a treat at Scrabble.  Oh, my God.  He plays it all...  It's so weird that you would want to...  Why would you want to do that?  ...play something all the time that you're so bad at.  And he gets so angry.  He slams at the desk.  He thinks that the game is cheating on him.  The game is cheating.  It's not even an electric game or anything.  It's a tile.  We should give you a card.  C is for body.  C is for crummy.  For the marital choice you made.  Let's say hi to Tony on Long Island.  Tony, what's up? 
[01:47:00]  Hello.  Let's go, Tony.  Come on.  All right.  I said, how about the cancer card for brain tumor?  Sorry you got this card, but we should remember it anyway.  It's not any more or less awful than anything that we've been saying, so...  All right.  We got a quickie before we get rolling in here.  A Wisconsin man broke into his neighbor's apartment to save a woman that he thought  was being raped, but he could not have been more mistaken.  Oh, no.  James Van Iveren heard a woman screaming in a neighbor's apartment. 
[01:47:30]  Armed with a three-foot-long sword, Iveren broke down the door to the apartment and rushed  in, but he only found Brett Steighorst watching an adult movie really loud.  Oh, no.  And you know he was probably...  Uh-huh.  You know he was probably, you know, doing what you do when you watch an adult movie.  What?  Your bills?  Very loudly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You do...  Here's my lipo.  Here's that one.  Oil bill.  Watching an adult movie really loud. 
[01:48:00]  He comes in with his three-foot-long sword and starts pointing it at me.  What a coincidence.  You had your sword out, too.  Sword fight.  He swung his sword at me.  I shot mine on him.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Shoe damage.  Shoe damage.  He comes in with a three-foot-long sword and starts pointing it at me and going, where  is she?  Where is she?  There was obviously nobody else there.  Iveren has been charged with three misdemeanors, and despite the incident, Steighorst says he 
[01:48:30]  does not have any plans to stop watching adult movies.  Well, thank God for that.  I'm sorry I walked in on your porno from Hallmark.  We know what C stands for.  I'm sorry I blocked it.  What do you got, then?  More to the story?  Yeah.  The guy actually had to...  When the cops came, he had to play the part in question for the cops.  Couldn't they just look around the room and see if there was a girl there?  I don't know, but...  Oh, well, the cops obviously wanted to just see... 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Show me where he is.  Yeah, show me which part.  All right.  What were you doing, sir?  That's great.  Yeah, go ahead.  Sit on the couch and show us.  When we get back, Roland's going to do $25,000 Pyramid.  Yeah, sort of.  With movies that are nominated for an Oscar.  Do we have to try to figure out what movie he's talking about?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's going to pick one out of a hat.  Out of a hat.  Yeah.  We have a big Lincoln top hat.  A big hole in it.  I hope there's the one movie, the Chicago Improv this weekend, that movie. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, Rich Voss and Bonnie going to Chicago.  You doing Steve Dahl's show?  Do you do radio up there?  I guess do radio Friday morning in Chicago.  Whose show is it?  You doing morning radio in Chicago?  Oh, I don't know.  We'll do some radio.  It's cold in Chicago.  Bring a clope.  Chicking on Steve Dahl's show.  On WCKG.  The club set it up?  Yeah.  I don't know what the club does.  I know I turned down one radio show there.  This layer of fat should keep him warm.  I turned down.  For Chicago. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  A little Eskimo you look like.  He is a dope, but I highly recommend you go to see Rich Voss and Bonnie in Chicago.  Oh, yeah.  For everybody listening in Chicago.  The Improv.  Yeah.  The Improv in Chicago.  What's that?  What show did you turn down?  They asked me to do Man Cow.  I never would do that.  You're not even on in Chicago.  You're not even on in Chicago anymore.  Then why did they ask me to do it?  That joke's on you.  Joke's on you.  He showed up.  Hello, Man Cow.  He doesn't have a Chicago affiliate.  I mean, maybe he's got a bullhorn that he's. . .  I think he's on the internet there or something.  Oh, great. 
[01:50:30]  What am I going to do next?  View Master?  No.  What?  All right, listen.  Roland's next.  It's Opie and Anthony and everybody else, including old Jimmy North.  Yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Right back to it.  We're going to try to squeeze a few more things in before we go over to XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:51:00]  Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio today.  We got Roland.  He's waiting in the wings.  Well, why is he waiting in the wings?  Because we got a dumb sex offender story.  I like the smart ones.  This guy is a dummy.  What did this guy do?  He offended sexually?  Oh, boy.  Well, I would like to tell you.  Oh, no.  We're on time constraint.  All right, here it is.  Over the years, he's changed his looks many times.  But it seems this convicted sex offender on probation keeps slipping back to his same old ways. 
[01:51:30]  Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.  Workers at the Hingham Public Library say this is where they spotted level three sex offender Mark Sullivan on a computer printing out child porn on Valentine's Day.  On Valentine's Day.  You don't even need a joke there.  That's adorable.  I was only joking.  Okay, it's all right then.  Wait, kiddie porn pictures, library, printer, Valentine's Day. 
[01:52:00]  He's printing them out.  You don't look at the positive.  At least she's level three.  How many levels are there?  You've got to level up.  It's like EverQuest.  Level 60 sex offender.  What the hell is level 10?  I don't think any of us want to know.  All right, there's more to the story.  Out from the printer popped an image of a young child, pre-adolescent child, in the nude.  The library director says the worker tried to take it away from Sullivan, but says he ripped it out of his hands. 
[01:52:30]  Immediately, he recognized we had a problem.  When Sullivan left the library, workers say they traced his search history and found his name because they say he looked it up.  He actually went into the Massachusetts sex registry list, put his own name in there.  Library workers matched the name to the face and called police.  What a dummy.  Right away, we saw that there was a problem.  This guy, yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  He's a mine.  No ass.  He turned around and came back when he realized he didn't have the bottom half of the picture.  Yeah, could you give me back the piece in your hand that he put his name in the search engine?  Give me the piece that has all the goodness on it.  Oh, what a dummy.  The piece that got me to level three.  Yeah, right.  I was level two without this.  How great is this?  Why did he put his name in?  You don't even know what it is because it's only half a picture?  You're like, what is it?  It looks like a young pig's mouth.  No.  Oh, God. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  Addison Improv.  Jimmy Norton.  Great way to spend Valentine's Day at the library printing out kiddie porn.  Well, lips to God's ears.  I didn't know you could print stuff out at the library.  Some of these stories, you don't even need to help it along.  And you know the computer isn't right near the printer anywhere.  No.  Like, I'm sure they have a community printer.  It's not like every cubicle or wherever he was has a computer, a printer, a scanner. 
[01:54:00]  So it's like it's got to – it's networked.  So you got to send it to a printer.  And then do you run to get it out?  Or do you just wait?  You got to go into the mind of the sex offender.  Yeah, what is he thinking?  Is it like –  It's like, okay.  And go.  All right.  This one's good.  And print.  Yeah.  All right.  Excuse me.  Where's the printer?  Where's the print?  Oh, it's around the – okay.  And then you just stand there waiting like someone else has got theirs queued up, so they're waiting. 
[01:54:30]  And you smile and give them that little smile nod.  Like, yeah, you're waiting too.  Just waiting for my child pornography to come out.  Be a minute.  What are you doing?  Taxes?  Yeah.  Well, it's coming up.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Level five, he drills a hole in a Dr. Seuss book.  Rich Voss.  Improv Chicago.  That's a library.  With Bonnie.  Of course.  All right.  Here we go.  We got the last part of the story here.  This part is great, too.  They also say he'd been searching a Russian child porn website, one that required a password. 
[01:55:00]  And it gets worse.  His history, they say, turned up a curiosity with buying police uniforms.  The thought that, you know, he could be using things he saw on eBay to purchase and then impersonate a police officer was more troubling.  That's pretty alarming.  It was pretty alarming.  But it's good to know that the fast action of the staff here at the library caught the library.  I just think it's awful.  It's disgusting. 
[01:55:30]  I can't see how anybody can be so stupid as to do something like that.  Boy, we really got a lot out of the witnesses there.  That's stupid, is it?  Right.  Thank you.  Am I the only one thinking meddlers?  Yeah.  Bud-inskis?  Stupid librarians got to tackle these creeps now.  The librarians.  Thank God for the librarians.  How bad a pedophile are you when you get busted by the library?  Yeah, the library gets you.  No Chris Hansen sting.  How bad a pedophile are you when you don't have your own computer and printer? 
[01:56:00]  I mean...  Yeah, right?  What kind of level three pedophile is he?  There were the old days.  I must say, I used to go to the local library when I was a kid and go to the photography section.  This was before the internet, my friends.  You've got to get it where you could.  And I would go to the photography section.  There would be nude photographs.  And I would rip them out of the books and fold them up and take them home.  Rip a book?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  And I would use them.  Anthony, level one.  Yeah, level one.  Well, no, they were women.  They weren't.  They're old.  What do you think?  They got kiddie porn in books at the library?  This guy's got to print it out.  They do if you have a good imagination.  These were women.  And they were, you know, it was old books in the 70s.  So, I mean, oof.  They used a lot of black ink on those pages.  We broke into the library when we were, you know...  Library, of course.  We called it a library.  We were bringing it to a library.  Because we thought it was... 
[01:57:00]  Like, we waited until they closed.  He didn't know what it was.  What's in there?  Ouch.  What are these things?  He heard the lie part.  He thought it was a place to sleep.  You know, if you just put a couch, you wait for a...  Hey, we got Roland in.  Yes, Roland.  What's up, Roland?  We haven't heard from you in a while.  Yeah, good, good.  Been going to the movies since then.  What's up?  Yeah, good, good.  How you been, Vos?  I...  I'm Roland, sorry.  So, you've been going to the movies. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, I saw Breach.  You saw Breach?  Yeah.  At...  How is it?  That was really good.  Really good.  You gotta talk right to that mic.  I can't...  I can't turn you up any louder.  Oh, it was really good.  Ah, really good.  Oh, wait.  We got your music.  Roland's theme song.  When you need radio gold, he's the one that you call.  With happy movie reviews, wears his shirts extra small.  The one you can count on the book, I guess, for a session.  But ends every single sentence he says in a question.  No pronunciation, soft-spoken and mumbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic and he crumbles. 
[01:58:00]  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonadeus, Bonadeus, check him out Friday wide.  He's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  I don't know.  It's in one channel and it's in two, then it's in one.  That's all right.  Well, today, here's his theme.  Yeah.  $25,000 pyramid.  Hey, people want you to say his name. 
[01:58:30]  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  All right.  Do you know what you're doing here, Roland?  I think so.  I did Google.  I didn't know what $25,000 pyramid was.  I Googled it.  I'm like, oh, there it is.  You know what the basis was?  Yeah.  Steve told me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's like a thing.  It was either a phrase or something. 
[01:59:00]  I don't know.  It's a thing, an item.  And you'd have to describe this to your partner who couldn't see what this was.  And you could only use one word at a time.  Like you couldn't say, you know, if you're describing driving a car, you'd have to go like gas, brake, steering wheel, turning.  Road.  Oh, steering wheel, maybe.  Meh, meh.  Oh, yeah.  Road.  Driving a car?  Yes, yes.  You couldn't say driving a car.  You know, that would be meh.  Steering wheel, just two words, right? 
[01:59:30]  But it might be one word.  Check.  We don't have time.  And as we do this with the movies, they're nominated for the Oscar.  Yeah.  Like, last king of Scotland.  Don't say, king.  Okay.  King of last.  Scotland.  Edy, I mean.  Edy.  You could say that.  Edy.  Well, all right.  Yeah, okay.  Sure.  All right, so pick a movie out of my hat.  We'll try this out here.  This is Roland.  You just got to look at the movie.  Don't show anybody. 
[02:00:00]  And just give us one.  Is this all play?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But go ooh, ooh, ooh when you have a guest.  Oh, okay.  Let me just do my guy.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Yeah.  Okay.  Patrice's mating call.  Okay.  Morocco.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh.  Jim Norton?  Oh, no.  I screwed up.  I was going to say the Rich of Washington story because I think you said Morano. 
[02:00:30]  All right, another one.  Mexico.  Mexico.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Babble.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, this is really exciting.  These are just all Oscar contenders.  It seemed like a great idea.  See, I think what Roland should do is just try to describe the movie in like, you know,  like almost review it, but in your inimitable one-word fashion. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Thrilling.  All right.  Spelling.  Because you could even figure out one word that makes it obvious to us.  Yeah, that would make it obvious.  Next movie.  Suspense.  All right, here we go.  This is much better, right?  Suspense.  And saving the bits.  Well, let's see.  Intrigue.  Boston.  Oh, oh, oh.  Suspense.  Suspense.  Wait, wait.  Suspense. 
[02:01:30]  Suspense.  Uh, Bonnie.  The Departed?  Yeah.  Oh.  Ah.  The Departed.  Are you guys getting points?  Yes.  We have, uh, uh, Opie has a point and Bonnie has a point.  All right.  And you never have a point.  Absolutely.  Oh, God.  We're about to.  Oh, God.  Only when you say, I'm fat, people go, you have a point.  Oh.  What?  Just a little chubby.  He'll get rid of it.  You're portly.  Just a little chubby around the belly.  Did you go to the bathroom yet today? 
[02:02:00]  Could be that.  Oh, my God.  Mom.  All right.  Roll again.  Next one.  This one is going to be a tougher one.  Um.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  No one saw it.  What?  Dreamgirls.  Um, no.  Wait, no one saw it.  Hold on.  Uh.  It's a wrestling move?  Oh.  I have Nelson.  See, you're, but you can't say it's a wrestling move.  And I saw that movie. 
[02:02:30]  It was one of the best movies of the year.  I didn't see it.  Wasn't it?  I loved it.  I heard it was good.  I'm going to.  Oh, because I knew ooh.  Well, he, he screwed up.  Oh, okay.  All right.  One word.  One word.  Not long descriptions.  No, sorry.  Yeah.  Rhymes with, uh, Paul Nelson.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Any time.  Um, Spanish?  Um, subtitled? 
[02:03:00]  Um, um, uh, uh, uh, Mel Gibson movie?  No.  Oh.  Kidding?  Ooh.  Magical?  I said, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Magical what?  Magical?  Um, uh, oh, oh, oh.  Trees?  The fountain.  Trees?  The fountain.  No.  The fountain.  Trees?  No.  Magical?  I'm going to stick with the fountain.  Oh, wait, wait.  Magical.  The screw.  Uh.  Magical Spanish trees.  The fountain.  Oh, I know it.  Jesus Potter. 
[02:03:30]  No.  I don't know the name.  Animals?  Um.  Animals.  Oh, oh.  The, the, the, the kid movie.  Jumanji.  No.  Um.  House?  Horse gag.  Animals?  Horse gag.  Let's see.  That's a descriptive house.  Roman.  It's only a few films.  What?  Like, uh, like a Roman.  Roman.  A guy that sounds like he has a stroke. 
[02:04:00]  Uh.  Um.  Kings.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, why?  No, no, I didn't have it.  He didn't have it.  What did you, indigestion?  What was that?  No, I, I bailed on it.  Oh.  Oh, oh, wow.  It must have been bad.  What was it?  I, I.  What were you going to say?  I don't remember.  Let's go.  Ah, you're not.  I need a point.  Jesus.  Um.  Good luck.  Okay.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Spanish.  Spanish.  Um. 
[02:04:30]  The fountain?  Come on, young Lou Duver.  Uh.  It's a.  It's a.  Talking animals.  Um.  I don't know.  Oh, that, um.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Oh, yes.  Okay.  Labyrinth.  Yeah.  Panslambra.  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  One more, because this is just, uh.  This stinks.  This is like a blind date, and the first half of an hour, you're going, oh, I got to get  out of this.  This is real.  Yeah.  The second it starts.  How do I get out of this?  The second it starts, you're just like, oh, this is really bad. 
[02:05:00]  At least we can take pride in the fact that we had two hours and 50 minutes of good radio  today.  Good radio.  And we finish up with limping across the finish line.  All right.  One more, Roland.  Come on, Roland.  Let's bring it all in.  Let's go.  One more.  All right.  Come on.  Here you go.  All right.  Pick a good one.  We're going out of the hat.  Out of the old hat.  Oh.  Oh.  Magic.  Oh, the HIV.  No, no.  Uh-oh.  Smoke.  Oh, I got it.  Ta-da.  The HIV story.

Real fast.  Sonny in Boston.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Hey, I learned that Richard Ross' baby could have been conceived at the Travel and Virus  Show at Camden, New Jersey.  Backstage.  You guys did admit you had sex at the ONA Traveling Virus.  Oh, yeah.  Backstage at the Camden Show, which was, I think, September 5th. 
[02:06:30]  Anything to it?  Actually, no.  It was a little later than that.  How would you know?  I know exactly when it was conceived.  I was out of town.  All right.  Well, we tried a new bit.  It sucked.  What can I tell you?  I'm not going to sit here and make believe it was good.  But a lot of fun today.  Rich Ross and Bonnie.  Improv in Chicago.  Chicago Improv.

[02:11:30]  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Out of touch.  Out of touch.  Out of touch.  Out of touch.  Out of touch.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM. 
[02:12:00]  Opie  Anthony  I'm dead  James Norton  I like yogurt  Robert Reed  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road 
[02:12:30]  The second half of the show begins now  Welcome to XM Satellite Radio  The second two-fifths  Or something  I don't know  Whatever it is, whatever we damn well decide it to be  Sometimes it's two and a half hours  Welcome to the last tenth of the show  Welcome to the end  We got Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio  And Rich was going to tell us a Daryl Strawberry story 
[02:13:00]  But we said save it for the air  Yeah, I just want to hear it  It's not a great story  I mean, years ago at Caroline's  They had this contest for  Like a Death Jam contest  With all black comics and I was in it  Of course you are  And Kenny Anderson from the Nets  Was one of the judges  And then yesterday I'm standing at the hotel  In the lobby right next to  And I go, that's Kenny Anderson  So I go, oh, that's him  I go, I think you saw me at Caroline's 
[02:13:30]  Oh my God, you had to turn it around to you  That's the Rich Voss way  That's great  And he's looking at me  What?  Huh?  I go, didn't you play for the Nets?  Right?  He goes, no, that's not me  And then I look over  And somebody else walks up  It was Daryl Strawberry  Oh no, you just mistook him  For some other Negro  Not even the right sport  You all look alike to me  You must be good at sports  Yeah 
[02:14:00]  You're black  I figured you played basketball  Didn't you recognize the nostrils?  Geez  Wow  Biggest nostrils ever  Daryl Strawberry  Well, so then in my head  I'm thinking, well, this guy  You know, I wonder if he's in recovery  And I said to him  Well, I don't watch sports  Since I quit gambling  And I wanted him to say  Well, I quit drinking  And I was going to say  Well, I just got 21 years  That didn't go any further  And then a lady from behind the counter  Brought my underarm deodorant  That I went down for  And he just looked at me  And walked away 
[02:14:30]  You do understand, like  You know, you knew he was in sports  And stuff  But it's Daryl Strawberry  It's not like  Like, even people that don't really  Know a lot about sports  Know Daryl Strawberry  I mean  I know, that was  Yeah, that's kind of one of those  Embarrassing moments  That you seem to have a lot of  Do you know me?  Did you see me at Caroline?  And the guy's probably thinking  What, was Caroline some bitch  I did coke with?  That's what you had in common 
[02:15:00]  You actually had stuff in common  With Daryl Strawberry  You could have talked about  Coke benders with him  And actually, like  Bonded with the guy  The only thing he wanted to talk about  Wow, your nose is built for cocaine  You didn't make that leap  To smoking it?  Yeah, what's your problem?  What's wrong with you?  Why would you have nostrils like that?  Yeah  You're all set  Yeah, but that's why he has  Hoover up  Big balls at a clip  That's why his habit was so expensive  You're right  It was just  Just to coat the inside of his nostrils  They would always pass him the mirror last 
[02:15:30]  Fuck, Daryl's here  Shit  How much do we have left?  Send him out for more  He's got to be clean by now  He looked good  He was walking around  With a Louis Vuitton bag like mine  Yeah, but you're not a professional athlete  A man on his arm  On the other arm  What do you mean?  I'm just saying  He didn't look like he was  Still out there  What do you think of his bag?  Rich Voss' bag  His  His man bag  Louis Vuitton  I bought it for him  Yeah  You really  Wow  Okay, here's the thing  I just don't see it  Do you see it? 
[02:16:00]  It's beautiful  Well, the new version  Okay, but here's what happened  Is that I bought  For Christmas  I got him a computer bag  A Louis Vuitton  Made for a computer bag  And it was too small  For his computer  So we went back  And tried to find a new one  And the one that would fit his computer  And stuff  So they didn't really have any more  So he got a racquetball bag  Yeah  Which was much too big  So I assume the third one  Was just right 
[02:16:30]  And he laid down  And went to sleep  And the fucking three little  Goldilocks and the three bears story  With your Louis Vuitton fucking bag  This one's just right  Yeah, he went back  The night  You know, after he got back  From O&A  Oh, I know  He was crucified  For coming in with that fucking thing  They made fun of my bag  I was like, what  What kind of bag  Goes and takes a bag  To show his buddies anyway  He was excited to show us  He really was  Yeah, and it was probably 
[02:17:00]  Devastating to him  That you guys  Oh, it was  If I would have came back  And said they made fun of my old bag  You would have thought  I was talking about you  Oh, ba-ba-ba-ba  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba  Why you  I showed you  All day long, folks  But it's like  Live with Rich Voss  Huddle, huddle  I was so proud of him  When I walked in  That would work  If your wife wasn't  As old as your daughter 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, I know  Jesus  You could go so many ways  To abuse your girlfriend or wife  Absolutely Burns and Allen  You know  Old woman joke  Yeah  The old bag  Well, here she is  Now let me pull a prop  Out of a steamer trunk  What the fuck are you doing?  Take my wife, please  Take my wife, please  But I gotta tell you, folks  Do ya?  All right  Right on  All right  Oh, poor Bonnie  All right 
[02:18:00]  All right  We got some stuff  Walking around with a  Miniature, driveling idiot  Inside of you  No, just wait  No, then the baby  Has to start correcting Rich  Yeah  It shouldn't take long  It's a cloak  It's a cloak  Daddy  Daddy  What did I say to the doctor?  He goes  Oh, we're getting the ultrasound  And I said  Is it a boy or girl?  And he said  Well, we can't tell  The sex of it yet  And Rich goes  Can you tell if it's black? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah  And the doctor's like  This serious Jewish guy  You know  He doesn't understand  Jokes like that  Rich doesn't care  He doesn't read that  Sort of thing  And people  He just keeps hammering stuff  Until they finally come around  Part of this is based on reality  You've got a little paranoia  When it comes to your wife  All I think about  Is the neighbor  That knew what the tiles looked like  In the kitchen  And that has boggled me  Every other thing 
[02:19:00]  I had an answer for  And was saying  Rich, you're out of your mind  Paranoid  That one thing  Is stuck in my mind  Like  How did the fucking neighbor  Know the tiles  Okay, but he  He's still out of his mind  With that neighbor  We were at the gym  He's like  He's at the gym  I knew you were staring at him  So to get him back  I was like  I go  See you later  To the guy  And I said it  To the wrong guy  It wasn't even him  In the long run  He won't be the wrong guy  The whore of the gym  Just waving to guys  All pregnant  Funny 
[02:19:30]  He's a slut  Pregnant  I told you  She got you the V's  Oh, if there is a headliner  With a Z  What have we done?  I can't wait for you  To be a father again  For the third time  Of a baby  Are the daughters  Are your daughters  Still drinking and banging?  Is my kids  And banging?  That's what you told us last time?  I didn't say that last time  I said  What disturbing stuff  Do I say at the dinner table? 
[02:20:00]  Oh, he's wrong  Wrong, wrong  She's doing good  They discovered drinking  That's kind of scary  The older one  A little  How old are you dating?  Little Linda's pot  No, 14 and 16  16 and 14  But no  She's going to her prom  She goes  Can I stay overnight  Down the shore?  No  You know  I said maybe the senior prom  Not, you know  A junior  Going with a senior  To a prom  You don't stay  Down the shore overnight  Do you know  Do you know  Your 16 year old  Yes  In three years  Can pretty much 
[02:20:30]  Start dating  Old radio guys  What?  Oh God  How gross  Oh God  It would be horrible  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  Hey, how you doing Rich?  You want to come on the show?  Yeah  Hey Dad  Well, her teachers  Already go up to her  And say  Oh, I heard your dad  Said this about you  On the radio  And stuff  Really?  Oh, really?  Gotta watch them  Yeah  Gotta watch those teachers 
[02:21:00]  Alright, we move into  Some good stuff here  Rich's daughters are cute though  I've seen pictures of them  They're very attractive  They're really hot  They got  Jesus, what's wrong with you?  I was trying to be nice  Just saying they're a cute girl  I hope he's ready to go to the library  And download pictures of them  Could you print these out, please?  They don't like knives on their bodies  Do they have fake IDs though?  Do they?  No  Give them up for our show  Huh?  Never stopped us before  Yeah, never stopped  You should bring them on sometime  Yeah  Make sure Ralphie Mae's here 
[02:21:30]  To clear the air  Wait, what is that?  It's an old gag  Ralphie Mae  Have saved our show  We might have been in trouble  With some underage girls  Only back on the radio  For less than three months  And we almost like  What dopes  We decided it was good  To get back into radio  And get a frozen Jaeger machine  And start drinking  And have girls come into the studio  To do things  And really not check their IDs  And something might have  One just didn't have an ID 
[02:22:00]  But we assumed  Let's just put it this way  One of the girls was so hammered  She tried to leave the studio  I know this is a visual  But she walked where you are, Rich  Behind Anthony  Oh, no  Trying to find a door  Trying to find a door back there  In the wall  Oh, my God  On the fifth floor  Oh, my God  She kind of walked through the wall  She's like  Ah, just drop  So instead of trying to help  Everyone was like  I could fuck that now  Oh, my God  That's how it turned out  She thought she was in the laughing set  Yeah  She's going to open the door  And Jimmy's cock is going to be in 
[02:22:30]  She just wandered around  I mean, if you were here  To see the studio  I mean, there's nothing that says  There's a door  No  Whatsoever  No  Anyway  What was Ralphie May's part in all this?  He ate him  He ate him  He ate all the evidence  Well, after he  You know, had a thumb up  One of the  Anyway  After he was treating one of the girls  Like a bowling ball  Well, one of the girls  Apparently 
[02:23:00]  Must have eaten something bad  She had what appeared to be food poisoning  And was vomiting  And she might have been naked at the time  Yeah  And it may have been outside the studio  Outside the studio on the sidewalk  Coming into the building  She could have been naked vomiting  We don't know for sure  Which even in New York City  Where no one's surprised at anything  Might bring the police  And sirens  And sirens and an ambulance  And when the ambulance driver  Driver  Ambulance driver  They love being called that 
[02:23:30]  When the EMT  EMS  It was the police  What do they want to be called?  The cops  It was actually the cop  That we had to impress  Perhaps  Smelled more than just the bad food  That she had  That gave her poison  Maybe the cordial  She had drank  With her  Lunch or breakfast  Because I believe it was  Six in the morning  He became suspicious  As to what she might have been doing  What was his name?  Vincent D'Onofrio?  Yes  And Jimmy was nowhere to be seen 
[02:24:00]  Because I believe he was hiding  The other girl  In one of the back offices  He had her in protective custody  In an office  Because we didn't want the situation  To get out of hand  And then there may have been  Something to do with a freight elevator  To smuggle people out  A back door  And one of the officers  Happened to be a fan of Ralphie Mae  So Ralphie  Was able to talk  To this gentleman  And keep things  All nice 
[02:24:30]  And nice  But did he  Did the officer  If it did happen here  Would he have known  Who you guys were  And he would have probably been  Oh  Everyone was ready  For arrest  Oh  It was pretty much  But we don't know  Everyone would have gone to jail  If anything like that  Would have happened  But we never would have let anything  This is just things  That may have happened  So how long does Ralphie's pass last  He was just in  He was just in last week  I know  We were supposed to go to  Dinner with him last week  That is a lifelong pass 
[02:25:00]  There should be a plaque in here  Yeah  And yeah  He is a good guy  We were barely back on the radio  And we're like  What are we doing  We just  We just sat out over two years  Yeah we actually  We're being dumb  We got such a scare over that one  That we all sat down  And kind of went  Look  We really got to watch ourselves  Because we all have the potential  Of just  Not only  Were the girls out of control  Using the Jägermeister machine  I think  They got 
[02:25:30]  They took the Jägermeister machine out  And they took the whiffle ball bat  Whiffle ball bat  And the one girl  May have been hammering  The whiffle ball bat  Into the other girl  Yeah  To a point where it was like  Oh my god  What is going to happen here  Where  Who knows  What kind of cervix damage  That might have been done  That's why the whiffle ball bat  Up there  Is in a glass case  We retired it  It's retired  It's nothing but a memory now  That's right  Wow  It's like  Yeah it's like  The babes bat  You know  Sounds like  Luke Gehrig's bat  You don't play with it  You just leave it in the case  It's famous  But the one girl 
[02:26:00]  Ah  Walking behind  And they try to find a door  It is funny  Because when we were  The funny part about that  If you're in the studio  There's a huge window  That shows you  That that's the way  Wow  To freedom  Right there  Then the glass door  Is you know  All glass  Any extra time  But she couldn't figure out  Yeah  At the exit side  Yeah  She decided  It had to be  Over here somewhere  Behind the equipment  Oh was she gone  Um  When we were in a  Kansas  Was it Kansas 
[02:26:30]  I saw a girl  Trying to  A drunk girl  Trying to get out  Through a mirror  Oh that's good  Could someone tell this  Shit to get out  Of my fucking way  I can't get through the door  Uh  To our defense  Yeah  You know this whole thing  Those girls did show up  With a band  And they had been drinking  Before they showed up  Oh yeah yeah  Remember  And  Oh  It actually is the truth  No it is the truth  For how loose of a defense  That is  If they had fake ID  It's not your fault  No it is the truth  Uh  They were definitely 
[02:27:00]  Well on their way  Fake ID  Well on their way  Oh god  They should have brought  Fake pubic hair too  I'm teasing of course  See  I think I saw some wisps  The beauty of this show  What's real and what's not  Yeah  Who knows  Who knows  Well good for Ralphie  That's you know  That's just a  A great one in a million shot  Two in a million  Thank god  Thank god we found  A Ralphie May fan  That was a cop  I saw you  I think it's easier 
[02:27:30]  I guess the cop was wearing FUBU  I think it's easier  To win the lottery  No he's funny man  He's funny  He can  He can take a little  Abuse or a lot  Yeah that's true  A little ribbing  He wouldn't be on our show  He can take a ribbing  The one that tips over  The Flintstones car  That's a hot joke  Sorry Randy  He's like  Oh  Hey you want to hear  Something fun  What's that  Yeah  This is fun  Okay that's enough  Okay say it now  We don't like  Spooky niggles  See there's too many  Sparky niggles at the party

[02:44:00]  Fuck themselves  And their fuckholes  Sparkling wiggle  Fucking YouTube  Okay that's enough  Okay say it now  We don't like  Sparkling wiggles  See there's too many  Sparkling wiggles  At the party  There's so many  Sparkling wiggles  At the party  See  No sparkling wiggles  Here  No sparkling wiggles  Here  Now get a job  Sparkling wiggles  Here  It's all  Falcon wiggles  It's time  For another  Opie and Anthony  Show  Scream along  Shut up 
[02:44:30]  Shut up  Okay  Terrific  The Opie and Anthony  Show  All right 
[02:45:00]  We're back  With the Opie and Anthony  Show  This is really cool  We got Brian  From Break.com  In the studio  We're huge fans  Of Break.com  Appreciate it  We're pretty much  Cursing YouTube  On a daily basis  At this point  Because we're so  Frustrated by their  Stupid rules  Yeah I feel you  On that one  YouTube is  They're a monster  But they're pretty  Corporate now  Of course they're a monster  But yeah  Well yeah  You just said it all  I mean one of our guys  Got his whole account  Deleted again  Yeah  Something that is  Questionably  Everything was like  Pixelated out 
[02:45:30]  I guess  They weren't even shown  They weren't even shown  It was just the girl  With the knives  Being dragged along  You know what happens  Someone will see it  And they'll try it  And they'll die  And they'll sue  And that's what it is  So blame the fucking lawyers  But YouTube  Why do you say Jews?  That's what I meant  What I hate about YouTube  They have this policy  If you put up a video up there  That they don't like  They don't  They should just get rid  Of that one video  They delete your entire account 
[02:46:00]  Yeah well I think  They've got the problem  Of they've got so many  People on there  With so many videos  And so many accounts  They can't take the time  To respond to one email  From somebody saying  Why did my video get removed?  So with break  If there's something  Questionable  Like Steve's emailed me  A couple times  Because his videos  Got taken down  Or whatever  Oh I thought you meant  For a date  Well how do they  Monitor all those videos?  How do they monitor  All you know  I mean there's millions  And millions coming in  It has to be so many hits  Before it even makes  A difference right?  Well YouTube relies  Pretty heavily on that  On that like  Mark is inappropriate 
[02:46:30]  Button I think  Yeah  And so do we  We our site has a  Like we use our community  To monitor  The just submit detection  As well  But pretty much  When you're talking about  Thousands and thousands  Of videos on a daily basis  You can't expect  To catch them all  So you have to rely  On your users  To mark everything  Brian  Go ahead  I just want to know  How you like  Dreamt this up  Was it you?  Somebody else?  You go  Ah let's do this  Because it seems like  A lot of  A lot of  Entry level work  As far as getting  Servers up  And bandwidth 
[02:47:00]  Like what do you  Pay for bandwidth charges?  It started off  In a garage  And it was  You know  It was just a guy  In his garage  In Chicago  Sitting there  And he started  Posting videos  That his friends  Thought were funny  And then  Sort of snowball  So I mean  It's like every  Internet story  It just starts off  Something hits  And then it snowballs  Into  Why doesn't Steve  Have that story?  Boundary  He was  He was  He got  Abort early on  People got lost  From his site  Because I tried  To make the website  As ADD  As this radio show  And that's where  I went wrong  The show Lost 
[02:47:30]  Is based actually  On Steve's website  You know what  Steve's problem is  And I think  He's learning  He's starting to learn  From some of these sites  When you see  Something interesting  And you click  On the link  The video comes up  Instead of  Eight times  You have to click  Onto eight different links  And eight different pages  Before a video comes up  Well that was what we did  Over the last couple years  We got with guys  Like Brian  And other people  That had these  Massively popular websites 
[02:48:00]  Showed them  Foundry  And said  What are we doing wrong?  And like  The list of 300 things  You have to change  Immediately  You ought to start  A website called  What not to do  When running a website  Dot com  I've done it all  Well one thing  We were just talking about  Is that  When I first started  Talking to Steve  About a year and a half ago  The videos he was sending me  Had these huge  Foundry music  Huge  Thank you  Believe me  We told him that  We told him to calm  The fuck down with that  It makes it hard for us  To like  To post them like that  Of course  Now when it's like  Touch spinner on the top 
[02:48:30]  And the bottom  We have no problem  We have no problem  Promoting anybody  I mean  We love it when you guys  Talk about it  So we're going to put up  Anything  Well we got Jackie the knife girl  We want on the front page  Today  On the front page  That's the one I was showing you  Oh yeah yeah  I can do something like that  Yeah that's probably fine  I heard you say monitor  You guys are  You can put anything on yours  Right  On your  I mean  They got their own rules  But they're not as crazy  As YouTube  The Jackie the knife girl  That's the video  YouTube said no to  That's why we  That's the  Yeah so we want you  To throw it on the front page  And we're going to  Just talk about 
[02:49:00]  Break.com all day tomorrow  All day  I'll put it on the front page  Yeah I can put it on the front page  At 12 o'clock  What videos are the ones  That you've seen  That really take off  Well yours took off like crazy  Yeah  And I didn't even expect that  I honestly  That was ridiculous  I know  He sent me that video  And I was like  Eh 200,000  Yeah  Installing Vista to his shredder  Because it wasn't working on his computer  But so many people got pissed off  With Vista  Yeah  And it hit a nerve  And it got posted on  I'm sure a ton of blogs  And then the Mac and PC people 
[02:49:30]  That always have a battle  Kind of picked up on it  It got linked to a bunch of other sites  So that kind of  Yeah  Took off  But  By the way  At one point  Almost two million views on break  That's fantastic  Anthony's video  And these guys also helped us out with Baby Bird  Because YouTube  Oh yeah  Fucked us with Baby Bird  They yanked it  We promoted  I'm not going to lie to you  We promoted it  It was earlier on  Where we  Before we saw the light  So we told everyone to go to  You know YouTube  To see Baby Bird  They yanked it on us  Yeah  And we had replays going all day  And we were driving traffic to them 
[02:50:00]  And you helped us out  Threw it on the front page  And that video got close to two million views  Yeah that went insane  Yeah  That one got insane  But the video  Going back to your question  The video that I'm sure you guys have seen  In there on XM right now  So I can say whatever I want  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  The girl that takes a shit in the hot tub  Yeah  Yeah  Alright let me ask you about  That is so fake  I think it's completely fake  Thank you  And I saw it 24 hours  Before anybody else saw it  Because it was sent to me exclusively  And I was like  I'm not posting that  Because as soon as I post it  Everyone's going to be like  This is not real  Fake 
[02:50:30]  This is not real  It's still fake  Which I was wrong about  Everybody posted it like the next day  And they loved it  Yeah it was huge  The lighting  And just the acting  Of everyone jumping out of the hot tub  I was like  This is so fake  That one frustrated me  Yeah  Because everyone was buying into it  You know what I love about these sites  Is when something isn't fake  And you'll always get  In the comments section  Dude that is so fake  Yeah  30 pages were fake  It's become like a tradition  On break  For people to be like  Oh this is so fake  Even if that's real 
[02:51:00]  They'll be like  Oh that's fake  That's fake  That guy didn't really puke  In his mouth  That was computer animation  That was graphics  They said about baby bird  A little bit  Yeah  Something we're trying  What did you hear my daughter  Say wiggles  Oh yeah  Great video  Which we  That's a biggie  I posted that  Thinking nothing of it  I was like  Ah it's a funny video  People think it's funny  People have senses of humor  Right  It's just a little girl  Our parents are obviously into it  We got so many complaints  About that video  Complaints  People writing us  I'm sitting there  On my Blackberry  My Blackberry's going nuts  People saying 
[02:51:30]  I will never come back  To your site  This is abuse  This is all this other stuff  If you don't take this down  The next 24 hours  I won't come back to your site  That's like after 10 emails  And normally we don't think  We don't even care  But we got 150  200 people saying that  And normally you think  If you get 100 emails  If you get 10 emails  It's probably 1,000 people  If you get 100 people  It might be  Yeah  10,000  100,000 people feeling that way  So we had to take it down  But the kid thinks  That she's saying something else  Yeah  Yeah  The mother is the most offensive thing  In that whole clip 
[02:52:00]  Back it up slightly  That hot tub thing  3 million views  3 million  3 million views  And that's before we had  We only for the last  You know  9 months  Have had really  Accurate  Tracking  So I'd probably double that  Yeah  Wow  Let's go to Ken Ball  He said you made him a star  Ken Ball  What's up?  It's Kendall  But Sam with Adam's  Trouble with that  I just wanted to thank you man  We had a project down here  The God Hates Fags video  A couple weeks ago 
[02:52:30]  And YouTube took it down  After one day  And we were able to get  A million hits  Just off Break.com  Yeah it's a funny video  Another one that started  You know  150 pages worth of comments  Normal video has like  250 pages worth of comments  Wait what is this video?  I haven't seen that one yet  What's it called?  God Hates Fags?  Yeah look under  Go to Break.com  And look under  Donnie Davies  Oh it's that song right?

[02:53:00]  Tough way to ask the question there  Alright you answered the question  Okay  Yeah  You answered the question  But there's a lot more  I mean it's not just a joke  I mean these guys  And I just help them out  But these guys are really serious  About trying to get message out there  And that sort of thing  It's really good satire  And what's the name of their group?  The Aryan what?  Alright  How do you guys  Like make money?  Is it just  Mostly you know  Advertisements  Advertisements? 
[02:53:30]  I don't know if you've noticed  In the last six months or so  We're starting to  You know bumper the whole site  For movies like we just did  For Norbit  Which we'd like to  Single handedly take credit  For their making all that money  But  Jesus somebody has to  Take credit for it  I know right  It looked awful  I'm sorry  It's becoming a lot easier  Because there's all these  Movie companies out there  Who are trying to reach  Men 18 to 35  And they're not watching TV anymore  And they're all coming to break  So  Oh a lot of video sites  I can't imagine  The bandwidth cost  Because there's  Millions of 
[02:54:00]  Friggin videos up there  And you know  I know compression's  Great these days  But it's still gotta be  Before YouTube at school  They were paying  A cool mil a month  A mil a month  Just on their bandwidth chart  Wow  I have no idea  What ours is  But  Yeah if you're in a garage  That's one thing  When you start getting  The bills in the mail  You gotta start coming up  With a way to make money  And then you get people going  You sold out  You guys sold out  Putting ads on  I never saw an ad on this  Well excuse me  I got bandwidth charges  Remember back in 
[02:54:30]  This was like 95  96 maybe  I got a website  And it was all HTML  And I  You know  I'm just posting pictures  And even video  And there was like  No compression back then  I'm putting up  Like AVIs and stuff  It's just huge files  And I got my bill  At the end of the month  And it was for like  $2,500  For what normally costs 
[02:55:00]  Like 19 bucks a month  And I got like  This $2,500 bill  And you only had like  Three videos  And maybe five pictures  What is this for  And you go  Bandwidth  What's that  I thought I just  Put stuff up  And it was cool  That people downloaded it  And then I put  Click throughs on  Back then you could get  Away with click throughs  And I just got yelled at  Just got yelled at  By people  I'm like  Don't you get it  Penny a click  And you had it up  Getting some righteous checks  Absolutely you were  The old days

[03:08:30]  Yeah  Hi John  How you doing guys  I used to  I used to  Work in a meat shop  And one of the regulations  Is that the FDA  Did allow  16 rat hairs  Per package of meat  16 rat  Per  16 rat hairs  Like a tuft  That's a tuft of hair  That's a lot  That's a patch  That is  That's a thatch  That's Bonnie  That's Bonnie  They only have 16 hairs  16 hairs  I don't know  That would be a little  Oh wait a minute 
[03:09:00]  Alright we're over here  We can talk  Over here now  Alright that reminded me of something  We gotta try to keep it clean over there  So because she's pregnant  You're not  What going down on her?  Yeah  No no no  You said something during the break  And I forgot that  You think it's gross now  No I didn't  You did?  No  Oh god  No  Yeah you were getting coffee  No  I didn't say that  You fucking asshole  Oh wow  Bonnie's getting coffee  No  No  I don't  Oh Bonnie's crying 
[03:09:30]  No  Bonnie's getting coffee  I'm carrying your baby  Listen  Are you talking to someone in the audience?  Shut up  I'm carrying your career  Oh  Wow  How does it go?  Why do you get mad at me?  That's a joke  I like going down on her  But it's  So here's the but  Is it changing?  Are her parts changing down there?  Not really  It looks a little more meatier  But it's not really changing  It doesn't  It doesn't  Wait for the big water slide ride 
[03:10:00]  That the kid's gonna take  A little more swollen  For the record  I've always had fat labias  Yeah  The way I was built  I don't know  Maybe it's just  I don't know  It kind of looks more like an airbags now  They're setting up  They're setting up the scaffolding down there  Getting ready to go  Construction guys all around the air  I-beams swinging along  Riveters  Like old school  Like when they built the Chrysler building  A line of  A line of guys 
[03:10:30]  Having lunch at the top of her back  Sitting there  Just sitting there  Cat calling the women  There's some guy in the corner  With that hat selling papers  Bonnie's great all about it  Bonnie is wearing a goddamn  Newsy hat  To the 40s lady  It doesn't go with a hat  It's a dumb thing  The hat is so  Look I'm gonna have a baby  What's the big deal about it?  That is  Women have babies all over the world 
[03:11:00]  God damn it  40s broad  The tough broad  That's the one she plays  With the tough hat  Yeah  Smoking  While she's pregnant  When aren't you allowed on flights?  I don't know  After five, six months?  No I think it's actually like seven months  Alright so when you get to that point  You're not allowed to do the show anymore either  Why?  Same problem  Wouldn't that be great?  But wouldn't that be good to go into labor?  If her water would broke  And we made an intern come in here  And rub it on his face  That's what we would do 
[03:11:30]  Oh wait I think my water's gonna break  Quick don't hold it in  Quick get in here  Get one of these idiots in here to get under her  All of a sudden we're  Yeah they drink it with liquor made or Kool-Aid  All of a sudden we're passing out straws  If someone eats the afterbirth  They get a pretty open Anthony t-shirt  You can't  One lucky listener will get to chew through the umbilical cord  Oh my god  Razzle dazzle  Alright listen 
[03:12:00]  Let's make a promotion out of your pregnancy  Let's go to Chris in Georgia  Chris  Hi how's it going?  Hey there Chris what you got?  I just wanted to say my friend  He used to work for a certain franchise  That we all know  That they allow 10% horse meat in their burgers  See  McDonald's  I think that's a lie too  See I told you  Yeah  That's true  Old Barbro might be in a burger you know  I was also gonna tell Voss  I took your advice  I quit smoking man  Oh really how long has it been? 
[03:12:30]  It's been ever since I called you up that night  You were on that Saturday  It's probably been about three weeks now  Oh that's the night when Bonnie and I  Did this successful show that Saturday night  Yeah  Yeah I was the last caller  Oh you were the boring guy  Oh I'm sorry  The boring guy  Just kidding  Good congratulations  Like I'm somebody  The boring guy  I only quit eight months ago  I was the boring guy  And why'd you leave him on for three hours?  Oh  Oh wow  Space

[03:13:30]  Like the  Inside every Hershey's kiss  Is a little rat shit  No they figured out  They can't keep the rats out of these factories  Yeah  So they had to allow for some of this stuff  There's probably like  More rat shit  I'm telling you  I read a whole article on this one  In the air  In the dust  You didn't find it on Snopes right?  No  They're keeping it a mystery  Have you guys ever had rat shit nuggets?  No  Rat shit  You came out of the gate  It's a cereal  No  It's a cereal  God you are killing  Yeah  Good night everyone  I've gotta go 
[03:14:00]  She's only missed one  It's a baby  This is true  It's a baby  Can't a girl fail once in a while?  God  Show how the baby  Show how the baby  How you teach him to put his hand out  And do that thing  Scratch my leg  Oh  It masturbates me  It's like a little magic trick  You can just sit there  With your hands behind your head  Relaxing  Alright then  Come on  The doctor  When we took her to the doctor  He's like a funny guy  And he's looking at you  And he came out with a rabbit

[03:16:30]  Jerry doesn't know  And just  She realized it was more of the same  No Jerry  She's just a girl from the street  She doesn't know  Our relationship  Get out of my fucking house  He wants us to go  That was great casting  Cause that's how  Jerry Lewis  That's how everyone said  Everyone was like  He wasn't acting  That's just he's a prick  He's just a dick  Talks like that  To the paper boy  When she met  Christopher Reeves  When he was a dick to you  When you just wanted  To say hi to him  I saw him in a hardware store  And I just wanted 
[03:17:00]  Was he getting bolts  For the chair  I just wanted to  To say hi  And you know  Just to meet him  And um  I thought he was  A total asshole  But then  I realized  It wasn't Christopher Reeves  It was a vacuum  God damn  You so tricked me  I so thought  You actually met him  In a hardware store  In his little wheelchair  I thought maybe  It was before  He got paralyzed

[03:35:30]  It's worth playing again  Because we really want  More girls to do this  So this trucker  Pulled over  We really want more girls  To do this  Yeah because it's  There's something  Really funny about this  I understand  A girl takes a dump  In front of her man  He's bitching  And complaining  And then  She gets it into a bag  She ties up the bag  And this is where  The audio begins  Right  Alright cool  Okay I'm tying the bag up  Did you hear it?  Yeah  Do it again  Do it again 
[03:36:00]  Okay  Come on  She's throwing her shit bag  Against the window  Look we all got a good laugh  Now is that real or not?  It says real  Alright one more time  Throw it against the window?  Yeah  Okay  It's really starting  To sync up the truck  Okay  Here we go  How do you not find that funny? 
[03:36:30]  That's our new bit  That is funny  And for a new bit though  We have to get another person  To do it  That sounds like one of those things  That only one person  Would ever do  Yes Danny?  So you're looking disgusted  For a moment  No no not disgusted  It just reminded me  Of a story  Of something that happened  To me when I was a kid  I was  We were all hanging out  On our usual hangout block  And one of the older kids  Came by in a car  And he jumped out  Like it was like  A big emergency  Sort of situation 
[03:37:00]  And he hops out  To the back seat  And he hands me a bag  But not like a  Grocery bag  It was one of the thicker  Like a gap style bag  And he's like  Dude hold this  Hold this for me  I'll be right back  I'll be right back  So he hops in his car  I think you know  Where this is going  Yeah  So they all  They all take off  And I'm sitting there  You know  In front of a store  With some friends of mine  Just holding this mysterious bag  And wondering if he's ever  Going to come back  For it or not  So about 15 minutes  Goes by  And I decide  Screw it  I want to see  What's in the bag  So I untie the knife  And it was a big fat shit 
[03:37:30]  A big load  But even funnier than that  Was the guy  Who had initially  Gave it to me  Comes back  Like another 15 minutes later  And he obviously  He knew the jig was up  The shit was out of the bag  Yeah  So he took it  And he held it  In the palm of his hand  And ripped the top  Of the bag off  So it was just his palm  Then a layer of plastic  And a big shit  And then proceeded  To just smash it  Onto one of  Onto one of the storefronts  That was on this block  And it probably 
[03:38:00]  It probably sat on the window  Smushed  For  I don't know  At least six to eight months  And we would just watch it  Slowly get smaller and smaller  As the seasons passed  Oh  Wow  Fucking  Than just got pwned  Oh man  Oh your story  Just fucking  Bit ass  Compared to the  Danny shit  You were the warm up act  You mean the story  I was using to stretch  While Danny did his work  And you know  Great shit story Danny
