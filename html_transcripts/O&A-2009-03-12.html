<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties, a brief period of echoing near the microphone.  Opie then sarcastically welcomed new listeners to the satellite radio show, warning them of the uncensored nature of their content, including offensive jokes, particularly targeting Asian people, contrasting their freedom with mainstream radio's limitations.  They discussed Heath Ledger's posthumous Oscar win, with Opie expressing disappointment over his absence, quickly escalating into a vulgar exchange between the hosts.

The show then delved into their PalTalk experiences from the previous night, describing encounters with underage girls being harassed and a woman engaging in sexually suggestive behavior.  A significant portion focused on criticizing news personalities like Keith Olbermann, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Rush Limbaugh, dissecting their perceived biases and the performative nature of their on-air personas.  A caller defended Limbaugh, arguing his criticisms targeted Obama's policies, not the man himself.  The hosts also engaged in explicit commentary on Britney Spears' appearance, referencing photos and speculating on her lifestyle and plastic surgery.

Kenny, a staff member, gifted Opie boxing gloves and washed his truck, leading to discussion of Kenny's personality and a "handling fee" for his services.  A caller shared details of a South Park episode satirizing the Jonas Brothers, transitioning the conversation to Family Guy and the Parents Television Council's criticism, specifically citing an "11-way gay orgy" scene.  The hosts criticized the PTC's hypocrisy. This spurred a broader discussion on censorship and protecting children's sensibilities, further devolving into vulgar and sexually suggestive comments.  They also discussed a scene from the Harvey Milk movie depicting spanking, engaging in humorous speculation about the actors' experience filming it.  Throughout, they interacted with callers, incorporating their comments into the discussion.

The show continued with Opie recounting a morbid joke involving fellatio, leading to a graphic discussion of the act.  They then discussed an online feud between listeners Steven S and Blue Heeler, noting the show's popularity on Google Trends and the ironic timing of Steven S's increased exposure coinciding with the feud's end.  They offered darkly cynical and humorous commentary on the live coverage of Bernie Madoff's transport to court, suggesting violent scenarios and expressing concern over potential repercussions for their comments.  Finally, they discussed upcoming guests: Colin Quinn, Waddle, George, and Terry Schiavo (with comments about her condition after being taken off life support), mentioning a planned interview about a TV show about warriors, but expressing disinterest in favor of horror movies, ultimately telling Terry Schiavo not to come.  The entire broadcast was characterized by highly vulgar language, sexually explicit content, and offensive jokes.  David Dallas was mentioned as a caller, but no other guests besides the hosts were explicitly named as being in studio.

[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio bad boys.  Radio bad boys, Opi and Anthony.  Fishmen. 
[00:04:00]  This Heath Ledger, I mean, there was going to be no surprise there.  It was so obvious he was going to win.  And I was disappointed.  I thought we were going to see a corpse.  Too soon.  Too soon.  Did you quit smoking yet?  No, I didn't quit smoking.  Why don't you guys attack him like you attack me?  Quit smoking.  We don't care if he dies.  They care about you.  Why don't you shove it?  Shove it like your mother did.  Shove it like your mother takes it.  Your mother, that whore. 
[00:04:30]  That whore.  Think of your mom.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  You know what she does?  She's an effing whore.  She takes it in a dirty spot.  A dirty spot's a big, gaping one.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Shoe.  How nice.  I want to say hi to all the new listeners.  What does that sound?  You hear an echo, right? 
[00:05:00]  No, I hear like a...  You got an echo?  I hear like a...  I thought you were just breathing into the microphone.  Something bizarre.  No, no.  You still hear it?  It's gone now.  I think you just went...  No, no, no.  I didn't.  You didn't do that?  I swear.  It was like...  It sounded like something brushing on the microphone.  Like a coat.  It might have been your...  You haven't shaved?  No, no.  I know better than...  I know the fucking one fist rule.  I don't know.  We're hearing something...  There's a speaker on back here, which we can hear.  Is that it?  Yeah.  There you go.  That's all it is.  All right. 
[00:05:30]  That's what it was.  I was in the middle of welcoming all the new listeners.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  Well, Grace.  I ain't doing no fucking podcast anytime soon.  What?  I say not fuck them.  They understand.  They understand I'm doing that in jest.  I heard that a lot of people are signing up for XM, Sirius XM, whatever it's called right  now.  Which is good news.  Actually, maybe you call us if you're listening to us on satellite for the first time.  It would be nice to get a little feel for what's going on out there. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  There are people that just listened exclusively on FM.  Right.  And then they come over here and they listen and go, oh my God, they're not being beeped  out.  What happened?  They're going to get in trouble.  Did I hear them do an Asian joke?  That's crazy.  My God, man.  Because we taught them that Asian jokes are a no-no.  Yeah.  And doing the accent is a no-no if you work on regular radio.  I know.  You can't do that anymore.  That's insane.  We'll do whatever we want. 
[00:06:30]  Every day we got to do just.  Hi.  Hi.  Every day.  Hi.  Every day.  Just the over-the-top Asian accent.  It'd be funny if Anthony got really sensitive and just started dumping us every time we did  an Asian joke.  Yeah, and I got the button right here.  Hey, now.  Jimmy.  Insensitive.  He becomes a do-gooder.  Do-gooder.  That ain't happening.  Nope.  You should have seen the abuse that was going on last night on Pal Talk.  What happened?  Oh my God.  What happened?  Well, apparently since Lost wasn't on, we were in essence lost for something to do. 
[00:07:00]  Okay.  Everyone, because a lot of times we go into the lost room on Pal Talk and everybody kind  of trades like theories of what they think is going on.  So you're watching the show.  As they're jerking off?  With a bunch of people.  No, there's no jerking off.  You're in your mom's basement.  She might catch you.  I just picture, I don't have Pal Talk or anything yet.  Maybe I'll go down that road eventually.  You think it's just a big jerk fest?  I just picture it's like just jacking 24 hours a day, but there's themes. 
[00:07:30]  Like, well, today as we jack, we're going to watch Lost.  Lost jacking show.  It's the lost jacking show.  Sorry.  No, it's one of those deals.  It's kind of cool and geeky in a way that you can, you almost have this little communities  depending on what you're doing if you're at home.  If you're just sitting around drinking, you know, people are sitting around drinking.  Hey, what are you drinking?  You know, you hold up your bottle of Bud or whatever it is.  And then lost room, you go in there and it's like a commercial comes on and you're like,  holy shit, you know, do you think this is happening or that? 
[00:08:00]  Kind of a discussion like that.  And then last night, nothing was really going on.  So we were hanging out in one of the basic rooms that we usually hang out in and what  appeared to be very young, two young girls were on from, I believe, Indiana.  I think they were 17 years old and they were just being trashed by the room.  Why? 
[00:08:30]  Trashed.  I don't know.  Well, one of them was like, had a little bit of baby fat on her.  Right.  But it was, and I kept telling her, I go, you are right at the limit.  And at that age, that's not good.  I go, you could teeter each way anyway.  They didn't have a lot of clothes on?  No, they had plenty of clothes on.  Oh, okay.  They were sitting there on a couch smoking like nonstop.  And then the other girl looked like the red-haired boy from Harry Potter. 
[00:09:00]  Ron.  Ron was his name or something?  Yeah.  Looked like Ron.  And she was smoking like crazy.  And then we find out she's pregnant.  What?  It just, this turned into one of these soap operas where, and of course, the very sympathetic  room was just like giving her advice about how she should just have it ripped out of herself  and, you know, just keep drinking and everything.  It was one of those situations though where it went on for hours. 
[00:09:30]  Are they fans of the show?  No, I doubt it.  I think they just popped in the room.  That's what happened.  They just picked the wrong room.  They picked the wrong room.  Oops.  But they stayed for hours.  Right.  And then everybody got bored with them once the Scottish chick came on and started putting  her ankles behind her head.  Hello.  Yeah.  She had a good accent.  Hi, guys.  You want to smell my stink hole?  You can barely understand her.  And she's there with her ankles behind her fucking head. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And yeah, so Paltog was pretty entertaining last night.  Nice.  Very good.  Yeah.  God, I watched The Situation Room.  I missed out.  Oh, The Situation Room.  Sounds like you had a situation in the Paltog room.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  I was telling Ant, like, every once in a while, I don't do it every night because it'll drive  you nuts, but I'll-  Sure, go.  I'll watch it.  Well, that, why not?  Sure.  I'll watch all the talking heads. 
[00:10:30]  I'll go from CNN to Fox to MSNBC, right?  Yeah.  I was telling Ant just before we went live that I should agree more.  I'm not saying completely, because I think I'm in between, like, a Keith Olbermann and  a Sean Hannity, if you really want to know.  But I probably lean more toward a Keith Olbermann.  Yeah.  But I fucking hate the guy.  I think he's the biggest douchebag on TV by far.  So it's almost like he might be saying something that I agree with, and I still, like, ugh, 
[00:11:00]  I hate you.  Yeah.  And then I go over to Sean Hannity, and I don't really agree with a lot he has to say,  but I like him.  I like how he discusses things.  He makes me maybe think about how I think.  Mm-hmm.  Like, he's thought-provoking.  Yeah.  Which makes me very confused.  Very confused.  Because I should be, like, one of these guys, rah, rah, Keith.  Ugh.  But Keith Olbermann is such a pompous ass.  He really is.  That it's hard to relate to him, even if you agree with him. 
[00:11:30]  It's hard to say, yes, I agree with him, because you don't want to agree with such an incredible  douche.  He's just the worst.  And now he's using, like, morning show slash radio war tactics.  Yeah.  And Bill O'Reilly, I probably hate more than Keith Olbermann, which is, I hate to say that,  but Bill O'Reilly's a jerk.  But Keith Olbermann's, like, taking a page from our book and radio in general, and he's 
[00:12:00]  playing, like, Bill O'Reilly's audio on his show and trashing him and stopping the video  and then commenting.  Picking it apart.  Taking a few jabs at the fact that Bill O'Reilly might have gone into a back room at a strip  club once in Thailand or something.  I don't know.  Thailand?  Yeah.  But, you know, and I was thinking, God, if Keith Olbermann was on the radio, attempting  that radio war shit, he would get destroyed.  It's all cute on TV, how he takes his little shots and plays the video. 
[00:12:30]  But he would be in way over his head if he did that shit on radio.  Do people realize that even these talking heads and a lot of these guys, it's not 100% them  on the air?  Just like anything else.  Right.  It's show business.  Right.  It used to be news, but now these guys are completely editorializing.  They're not reporters.  What do they actually call them, besides assholes?  Well, I don't know.  They call them something else. 
[00:13:00]  They're not reporters.  They're not journalists.  They're not newsmen.  They're commentary, something like that, because it's their own opinions that are being thrown  in.  But most viewers still don't understand that.  Yeah, I know.  They think this is the news.  I should think this.  Yeah, exactly.  I should think this way.  They're trying to make you think their way instead of maybe presenting this stuff, and  then you as a human being that could think for yourself, you make some calls for yourself.  They love saying things like, we report, you decide, but they're shoving their opinions 
[00:13:30]  down your throat.  What amazes me is that Bill O'Reilly calls his show the No Spin Zone.  No Spin, and it's like the rotor on a helicopter.  Thank you.  He spins it his way.  He's a whirling dervish.  And if you agree with Bill O'Reilly, that's fine.  I don't even care, because I don't even give a shit about Keith Overman either.  No.  But to call your show the No Spin Zone as he's spinning, like Ant said, like a fucking  tornado, and no one calls him out on this. 
[00:14:00]  Nobody.  It's just a thing that you've got to understand that these guys are in show business.  So they go on and put on a show that isn't, they don't have to adhere to the rules that  reporters are supposed to adhere to, and anchorman and things like that.  So they can say whatever they want and present it however they want, so they'll do it in  almost a shock jock fashion, where they rag on the other guy.  Sure.  Or they'll twist around facts to better suit their opinion. 
[00:14:30]  It's a show.  Do you think that they're like that off the air all the time, when they're just sitting  at a bar drinking, and someone comes up and just starts debating them on something?  I honestly think Keith Overman plays that role all the time now.  I don't know.  Because he's like, he's, yeah.  I don't know.  You think as soon as the cameras are off, he's a whole different person?  Dude, do you honestly think when he's filling out that fucking tax return, he's enjoying 
[00:15:00]  his new upper tax bracket Obama fucking plan?  Oh, I understand that.  Or is he going, motherfucker, I gotta pay this shit?  Yeah, I understand that.  And do you think other things, he's just not bashing, and do you think there's certain  things that, even Hannity, you know, or-  Well, Hannity said something last night.  O'Reilly.  Let me jump in for a second, because they were having a 401k discussion yesterday, and he's  like, yeah, just like anyone else, I'm worried about my 401k, and I'm like, all right, Sean, 
[00:15:30]  guy probably makes tens of millions of dollars.  Shut up.  It's all relative.  I'm sure he is.  Yeah, but he was trying to make it like, I'm a regular guy, just like you, worried  about my 401k going away.  He's got, I mean, sure, no one wants to lose money.  I bet he's got an 802k.  Yeah, in a way, it's relative, and if you have 10 bucks, you don't want to lose 10 bucks  no matter how much money you make.  I understand that.  But he's the type of guy, if he lost his complete 401k, if he even has that officially, 
[00:16:00]  he's going to be all right.  This economy's not going to suck someone like Sean Hannity away.  You know what the odd thing is about this economy and this recession bordering on depression?  It's not the lower class earners that are really as worried as the upper class.  It's the people with money that are more worried.  First of all, I think they have more to lose. 
[00:16:30]  Secondly, I don't think they've ever been more vulnerable to losing a lot of money in  a quick period of time than they've ever been in this country.  You don't know what to do with your money if you're a wealthy guy.  Do you leave it in the bank?  The banks are failing.  What happens?  I got more than the FDIC is going to insure in the bank.  Oh, what happens if it fails?  Do I put it in the market?  Ah, the market!  I've been watching my bank accounts very closely the last two or three months. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  I never did that before.  I'm like, whatever.  Whatever.  I've always been like that.  I'm not a money guy.  It's like, all right, I'll throw it in the bank, whatever.  I don't even look at statements.  Really?  Every once in a while I do to make sure there's no one at the branch taking a little off the top.  You don't want to end up like, oh, Dane.  Yeah, no kidding.  You better keep your eye on your cash.  No, that's one thing I was always smart about.  No one has that type of power.  No one.  But also, I'm just like, ah, keep throwing in savings accounts. 
[00:17:30]  I check it every once in a while.  And every once in a while I go, oh, wow, doing all right.  Hey, hey, look at that.  Because you can't take that stuff seriously.  Nah.  Because tomorrow, eh, you don't have it anymore.  No, that's just it.  Whatever.  So you kind of pay attention to what's going on economically.  But the point being, those shows are just ridiculous on both sides.  Yeah.  On both sides.  Because I watched all, last night it was all Keith Overman and then all of Sean Hannity. 
[00:18:00]  And it was just like, oh, my God.  Like, how about we work a little bit to work, just work together a little bit.  That'll never happen.  I mean, Keith is like, rah, rah, rah, over here.  And Sean's like, rah, rah, rah, against the people that Keith Overman was just trashing and vice versa.  They depend on each other for their own mutual survival.  Do you think the hardcore conservatives want the liberal left to go away?  Then they're out of work.  I don't mean politically. 
[00:18:30]  I mean entertainment-wise.  Sure.  With these shows.  The best thing that happened to Rush Limbaugh was Obama being elected.  Of course.  The guy pretty much disappeared for the entire Bush administration.  He went from Clinton where he made his bones when Clinton was elected.  And that's when you really started hearing about Rush Limbaugh.  He had a great run.  Eight years.  And he had eight years of Clinton.  And then Bush got elected.  And you don't want to hear somebody lambasting the left when they're powerless.  So it got to the point where no one was really talking about Rush. 
[00:19:00]  They were talking about his pills and his bionic hearing.  And all that shit.  But they gave him a new ear pretty much.  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  He's got a wire out of his head or something into his ear.  And now, though, they're talking about him again.  The president's talking about him.  Washington's talking about him.  This is a dream come true for him.  So regardless of what you think of how Rush is saying he wants Obama to fail, he is happier than a pig in shit that he got elected. 
[00:19:30]  And this is where I get frustrated by all this stuff because exactly what you just said, Anthony, they're not honest.  I'm just going to tag what you said.  Not only does Rush Limbaugh not – doesn't want Obama to fail, he's hoping he gets reelected.  Of course.  Yes.  Yes.  People are like, you're crazy.  No.  Rush Limbaugh not only – I bet he even secretly votes for Obama. 
[00:20:00]  He gets in there, I'm casting my vote –  Think about it.  For John McCain.  Right.  And I go in here, okay, where's the – I wish I had my beep.  Where's the lever for the –  Oh, my God.  It's beep.  All right, I don't know where –  Where's the lever for the beep?  There it is.  I'm casting my vote.  Right.  Excellence in broadcasting.  The Rush Limbaugh vote happening now as I go into the voting booth. 
[00:20:30]  Of course I'll be voting for John McCain.  Yeah.  As I pull the lever.  Wait, it is a secret ballot.  Right.  So let me close the curtain now and make my vote.  All right.  One more vote for the –  Who else?  Liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal.  There we go.  Vote for –  Yeah, I'll give the old abortion – 
[00:21:00]  Anti-abortion vote.  I'll throw that out of the window.  Abortions for everybody.  There's my vote.  That's why all these guys are just full of shit.  Rush Limbaugh wants Obama in office for eight years.  You know what it is, though?  It's not full of shit.  It's his job.  If he was honest, he would fucking lose all the credibility that he has with his listeners.  His ditto heads.  He would lose –  Does he still call them ditto heads?  I don't even know if he does. 
[00:21:30]  He would lose all the credibility with them if he said, yes, I want Obama.  This is what he does.  He hopes for one thing.  Right.  And then preaches about it like it's the worst thing that ever happened.  Yeah.  But meanwhile, for him, it's perfect.  Of course you want that.  I know some of our listeners are called pests.  Yeah.  But then there's a whole bunch of people that listen that just don't have a name.  I mean, we got to start naming our listeners.  Asshole. 
[00:22:00]  I mean, he's got ditto heads.  What could we have?  We have retards.  Yeah.  Tards.  Tard heads.  Tards.  Maybe we'll –  Shit heads.  Maybe we'll come up with that.  You guys are misquoting Rush.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, no.  Right?  Oh, no.  David Dallas, how are you, David?  He didn't say he was going to vote for the –  How are you guys doing?  What's up, David?  Yeah, listen.  Everybody's misquoting Rush.  Yes, they are.  If he says he wants Obama to fail, he means that he doesn't want his agenda – he wants 
[00:22:30]  his agenda to fail.  Do you know how many times I've –  It was with communism.  Sir, do you know how many times I've actually defended Rush and said that exact thing?  Do you listen to the show a lot, a little, or none?  A lot.  Okay.  And have you heard me say that Rush Limbaugh was so misquoted by the liberal media that  he didn't say he wants Rush to fail?  He said if he succeeds, this will be a country that Rush does not – will not identify as 
[00:23:00]  the United States anymore.  It will be a socialist nation.  Right.  So he wants him to fail so the country can be prosperous as America, like the way it was  supposed to be when the Constitution was written.  I understand exactly what Rush said.  I'm not misquoting Rush.  You don't have to jump on everyone that talks about Rush and say I'm misquoting him.  I quoted him perfectly.  I didn't misquote him either.  No.  You're oversensitive.  My point is that, yeah, he wants his policies to fail, but he wants his policies to fail for 
[00:23:30]  eight years.  Go to Dealey Plaza, old Dallas.  He wants him to –  Have fun.  Do a recreation.  He wants him to hang on just enough to get reelected, though.  Yeah, that's what he wants.  Because that's good for Rush.  That's good for business.  Great for Rush.  What they leave out is that he said if – if he does this and this, then I want him to  fail.  Then I want him to fail.  Yeah.  It's if the government kind of taking over the banks and the auto industry and the government  running everything, if that's his idea. 
[00:24:00]  Socialism.  Yeah.  He doesn't – Rush Limbaugh does not want socialism in this country.  It doesn't work in any other nation.  So why would it work here?  Right.  Even the Democrats, though, are kind of, like, shitting on Obama's policies.  A few.  And then there's this other – like, he's taking these little rules that you can use  as president to almost do line-item vetoes on certain things. 
[00:24:30]  So a bill will get passed and then he'll pull out things that the Republicans put in  there, things that he doesn't like.  And he was – him and the Democrats were ripping the shit out of George Bush for doing  the exact same thing.  The line-item veto.  And he's doing it and nobody's questioning him on it.  I read a small little article on it yesterday.  What do they veto?  It's amazing what this guy gets away with.  What do they veto?  There were two items in the budget that he vetoed.  They were pretty small little items, but he deemed them unconstitutional.  Nice.  I like that. 
[00:25:00]  And as a president, you can then do a line-item veto like that.  But it's ridiculous that the Republicans can help out, write a bill, he can get sent it,  and then just say, no, no, no, no.  Transparency, my ass.  We can get back to that, but you were just saying this and it's on TV.  You said Britney Spears looks hot again.  They just showed video.  No, I – well, I don't know how all that – oh, is this new?  Is that new video right there?  The picture in the paper, yes.  In the cage?  No, that's her fat suit.  Thank you.  That's her fucking fat suit. 
[00:25:30]  That was a while ago.  No, that's the latest tour right there.  Dude, that was her fat suit.  I remember seeing that thing.  That's her fat suit.  That wasn't – that was not from –  What do you mean her fat suit?  I saw that video months ago.  So that video is before she completely trimmed back down?  Yeah.  I was talking about in the paper today.  Well, they showed a video, and it looks like her latest tour, and she looks awful.  Yeah, she comes down on the cage.  But the picture in the paper looks really, really good.  Because she's wearing this thing.  It's like a one-piece old granny bikini that she's wearing.  You know, there's Britt's comeback. 
[00:26:00]  She was at National Coliseum last night.  See, that doesn't look bad.  She's wearing some kind of stupid circus outfit.  But I think the Daily News had the picture where she's in her bikini.  And all I was really commenting on was that half her vagina is hanging out of her bikini.  And that – right in the Daily News?  Yeah!  Yeah!  It's wonderful.  Really?  Yeah, it's smooth as a silk.  Look.  Look at it. 
[00:26:30]  It's on – turn your workbooks to page 18.  Mine are over there still.  Of the Daily News.  And check that out.  Let me take a look.  Look, she's obviously meatier than she was before she had the baby.  But that's not bad right there.  Right?  Look at her on page 9 of the post, though.  She's losing her shape.  She's dressed like fucking Sergeant Pepper's meaty cunt band.  That's a stupid outfit.  And her breasts, I think she had them reduced.  I think she had some breast reduction, like took the implants out or some shit. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, you think?  Because it looks more natural.  I don't know.  She's not looking as bad as she looked.  Yeah, but we remember what she used to look like.  And I think it's just that she – I find her kooky accessible now.  Well, she's perfect for you.  If you actually find five minutes that you could sit with her, you're fucking going to be her boyfriend.  That's just the way it is.  You just need five lousy minutes.  You need the giant black security guards that she has. 
[00:27:30]  You've got to slip past them for five fucking minutes to talk to her.  And the next thing, you're the paparazzi.  You're holding hands.  You're driving away in fucking exotic cars with people snapping through the windshield at you.  Five fucking minutes with her.  How funny is that?  I swear.  Five minutes is all you need.  And all of a sudden, she gives you the key to her, man.  You're the guy then.  Who is this guy?  Because I didn't know Strauss was in yesterday.  And I believed him.  He's like, oh, dude, I thought I could have her.  And he could have. 
[00:28:00]  And he said I was only with her, what, an hour or something like that?  If that, yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  But in that five minutes, you've got to be quick because the bouncers are going to be coming back.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You've got to make her cry in that five minutes.  That's the key.  It's like a video game.  You've got to get in without setting off the alarms so you can talk to the boss.  Because if you set off the alarms and those big black security guys come over, you're done for.  Next thing you know, you're wearing some kind of Hollywood sunglasses.  You're holding her hands.  Yeah, you're holding hands.  You're walking. 
[00:28:30]  Going through the malls.  Britney's Mystery Man.  Who is it?  If it's you, all of a sudden, you don't even know us anymore.  Like, hey, guys, can please, please, me and Brit.  Britney with a shock jock?  Could it be?  That would so happen.  Shocking boyfriend for Brit.  What Would Tyler Durden Do has a ton of new Britney bikini pictures.  Of course they do.  Chris of Michigan.  There we go.  WTDD.com.  Look, she's beefy.  Yeah, she's definitely beefy. 
[00:29:00]  But you know something?  She looks better than she did.  I wouldn't call that fat.  I'd call it teetering.  Right.  She's teetering on the edge.  And for two kids, you know.  You could see the belly needs still a little work.  She needs some crunches, like severe.  But nowhere near a lasagna belly.  No, the breasteses look nice in that little blue bikini top.  Yeah.  Anything else there, Danny?  Any other picture we might want to see? 
[00:29:30]  Because it's always good to see two.  You can't just depend on one picture.  Right.  We need a side view.  Yeah.  You need something else.  Yeah, the side view.  The side view would be nice.  The back is good, too, because you've got to look at that ass.  Let's see.  That's nice.  All right.  All right.  See, there's no problem there.  Yeah, but when any girl bends over, their ass looks just amazing.  It stretches out a little bit.  Right.  Any girl?  I don't know.  Most girls.  All right.  Rosie O'Donnell. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  Jesus.  Is one I think of.  All right.  You got my point.  Jesus.  Is this the side view there, Danny?  Yeah, yeah.  The side view.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just the belly.  It's just the belly.  The legs look okay.  The ass looks all right.  Her tits are fine.  But she has a big pot belly.  See, we could have done it.  I wish I had some pot.  We could have done a morning show for Now FM, see? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  We could talk to the kids about Britney.  Yeah.  See, we're doing Britney breaks.  What about the Jonas Brothers?  How many men want to have sex with them?  You were taking your calls.  How many men do they want to have sex with?  Wow.  The real question.  What the hell is going on there?  I certainly have no idea, but come on.  Wow.  There's some suspicions there.  Are there?  What do you think?  Has there been speculation?  Dude, they're like the next Beatles.  They got girls all over the place and they're wearing promise rings? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Please.  What's that about?  They're a little...  You wear the promise ring like when you get older and no one gives a shit about you or  your music.  I have a promise ring.  She'll get her one.  A promise noose.  You guys want to give Stalker Patty a promise ring?  Yeah, let's get her a promise ring.  That's hilarious.  So, yeah, just to really seal the deal.  That's really funny.  On her stupid virginity.  Yeah.  Is that an old picture? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Of course it is.  That's an old Britney picture where she looked all innocent.  She's looking up at the camera, very smiling and sitting in kind of an innocent but provocative  pose.  A year after that picture is when she was in her prime, though.  With her legs open.  She was sucking dick back then, though.  Is that hot?  Who's fooling who?  You think all that was bullshit?  All that whole innocent stuff was bullshit.  I think her prime was when she did the MTV Music Awards that one year when she was dancing  with that big snake around her neck. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  She looked ridiculous.  That was really good.  I remember watching a whole fucking HBO special of one of her live lip synchings.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even call it a concert.  And she had her little sister playing the younger Britney.  Yeah.  That one, right?  That was nice.  Wasn't that 01 or 02?  That was back in AEW.  And now the little sister is a mommy.  And she was in a bathtub.  Remember that whole thing?  Mm-hmm.  Brought a bathtub out and... 
[00:32:30]  Remember it, Annie?  We all just talked about it like, oh, my God, did you see that last night?  Like a bunch of fags.  We're just talking about the Britney concert.  Remember at WNEW, management thought we were sickos because they'd come into our office  to talk about something, and there would be Britney Spears posters all over the world.  Oh.  Yeah, Britney's...  Yeah, look at that.  Look at her there.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at those little fat legs.  God damn.  Look at the guy in the front.  Looks like he's fisting her.  Yeah.  That picture.  Oh, wow. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Speaking of which.  That's nice.  My fist is back to normal.  Oh, did you put on the fucking piss glove?  No, I didn't yesterday.  I actually went and got...  Kenny actually surprised me with some nice boxing gloves this morning.  Kenny?  Brown nose!  Ew.  Just waiting for me at my door.  Here you go, G.H.  If you want to punch me in the head with him, feel free.  He wants to be liked so bad.  He BBMs me.  We learned that yesterday from, thank God, from Now FM. 
[00:33:30]  A lot of BBMing going on.  Oh, and Facebooking and tweeting and everything else.  So, Kenny, BBM me.  He goes, I left brand new boxing gloves at your front door.  Enjoy.  He's too much, man.  He just wants to be part of the gang.  Love me.  Right.  Please love me.  2 G.H. with love.  Here he comes.  Look at him. 
[00:34:00]  And he got me two kinds.  Really?  What did you get me, Kenny?  Because I just threw it in my apartment.  I was like, oh, whatever.  I got to go.  I don't have time to look at this crap.  I got you fingered and fingerless gloves.  Nice.  Plus the gel wraps.  Nice.  So you don't hurt your precious knuckles.  Precious.  And wrist wraps to support your wrists.  Yeah?  Yeah, because I need you in shape.  But that's too much stuff.  I just want to punch things.  Get some stress out. 
[00:34:30]  You're going to get splints in your wrists if you don't put something on them.  Really?  Yeah, you're going to fuck your hand up.  You got to put something on them.  I need you to be able to sign checks.  Exactly.  Just pay me.  And Anthony, I washed your truck this morning.  No way, Jose.  Well, Jose didn't do a good job, but I washed it.  Tell me about it.  I don't think they like drying that big truck.  No, they don't.  No.  At this time in the morning, they don't want to do anything.  No.  This is the time where these places want to just mellow out, drink coffee, whatever. 
[00:35:00]  You know what?  I'm going to plug a place.  It's Great Neck, the car wash in Great Neck.  Right there on 25A.  That's good for the people listening in Kansas.  You know what?  Fuck you, Kansas.  You got your own car wash.  Exactly.  Drive here and get it washed.  This place, you're pulling, they will spend, to the point where people get annoyed, like  they start looking at their watch going, Jesus Christ.  I got to go, right?  But you know, if you're going into this place, you're going to have to wait because it takes 
[00:35:30]  a long time.  They go over the whole goddamn thing, the rims, everything.  Oh, it looks fucking beautiful.  Nice.  Nice.  So what?  The Hispanic gentlemen don't like going over that whole thing, right?  I think they just wipe it down with dirty rags.  Yeah, that's what they do.  Did you know he was doing this for you?  No.  See, this is what Kenny does.  But that is what Kenny does.  All I wanted Kenny to do yesterday was put air in my tire so I had enough to get home  so I could get my tire fixed.  Right.  And Kenny gets the tire fixed. 
[00:36:00]  Aw!  When he takes my car, usually I throw water bottles in the back and stuff like that.  And he takes all the bottles out and throws them away.  And he also brought back what caused the flack tires.  Yeah, so he could see.  Because I like why I'm looking at a good screw that was in your tire.  Cody in Indiana.  Cody!  D-H-E-H, I've left you to box and close at your front door.  That'll be $49.95 for a pair and a $0.38 handling fee. 
[00:36:30]  Handling fee.  Cody knows about the handling fee.  The handling fee.  And we all don't mind that Kenny has a handling fee because he does a lot of little things  for all of us.  But the handling fee is embarrassing to look at.  $0.79 handling fee.  It's like, just round it up to a buck.  No one's looking at you.  But it wasn't worth a dollar.  I'm not worth a dollar.  My handling.  The handling fees.  You like the handling fees, Jimmy?  I certainly don't.  No.  I don't acknowledge them. 
[00:37:00]  Handling what?  Yeah, it's an itemized thing.  Billy gives us.  Who looks at it?  But if you do, you'll see the handling fee.  And it's just for ridiculous amounts.  And then he tells you if it's a certain amount laid, it's up this much percentage.  Oh, yeah.  Like he's fucking.  Yeah, he's a.  Like he's con ed.  I go over those things with a fine tooth comb.  I do.  Yeah, yeah.  I certainly do.  Nope.  Nope.  That was your treat.  Well, that's Kenny, though.  He's like over the top nice, but also he could easily turn into a loan shark like that. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, he's very good.  Oh, if you're late with the pig.  G.H., I'm going to have to bust your legs.  Right.  I don't want to do this, but I have to.  Racist joke on picks.  I must say, though, that you gentlemen treat me very nice and you're very generous to me.  And I thank you for that.  Well, thank you for being such a moron.  You might want to call Steve Brady. 
[00:38:00]  My pleasure.  When the next pill comes, compliment, $2.  That's probably right.  Am I paying you for the gloves or was that a gift?  Because we have this weird relationship that there's a friend thing happening, too, so there's, like, gift-giving.  Gift-giving.  I'm paying for it.  Gift-giving?  It's not your birthday yet.  What are you, crazy?  I want to make sure we get it out of the way.  All right.  Let's go to James in New Hampshire.  James.  James.  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, last night's New South Park was about the Jonas Brothers and their promise rings. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, shit, really?  Can we get some of that audio?  It's fantastic about how they're using the promise rings to sell sex to eight-year-old girls.  Eight-year-old?  They all, South Park will always take it to the extreme.  It could be, you know.  Yeah, go ahead.  They turned Mickey Mouse into basically Tony Soprano because the boys don't want to wear the rings anymore.  And Mickey Mouse comes in and starts beating the ever-living shit out of them. 
[00:39:00]  And it's fantastic.  And the whole time he's trashing the kids and beating them up, between lines he's giving the Mickey Mouse giggle.  Right.  Oh, it's disturbingly funny.  You've got to get the clips.  All right.  We're going to go find those.  Check that one out.  All right.  Later, boys.  Thank you, sir.  That's a show that I just stopped watching for no reason.  And then people will call up with how funny the show still is.  You just do that every so often, though.  I just got to start watching South Park again.  You do that every so often. 
[00:39:30]  You just stop watching something.  And then after a while, you catch an episode and go, I did that with Family Guy for the longest time.  I just stopped watching.  And then recently, I've been popping them on and laughing my balls off.  Well, Family Guy's in trouble.  It's hysterical.  That dumb parent group is on their case.  For the PTC?  Yeah, the PTC.  Fucking assholes the parents tell me.  For what?  Is filing an indecency complaint with the FCC against Fox's Family Guy.  For.  March 8th episode include.  That included, and this is from the press release, bestiality, orgies, and babies eating sperm. 
[00:40:00]  It's a cartoon.  Shut up.  Unfortunately.  Fox treated viewers to everything from an 11-way gay orgy.  An 11-way, it was called?  Yeah, see, Peter was on some experimental drugs.  And the side effect was that he was gay.  That's awesome.  So it was his fantasy to have an 11-way.  An 11-way.  What did the 11-way look like? 
[00:40:30]  It was behind closed doors.  But let's say the drug picked a very inopportune time to wear off.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Oh, my goodness.  Yes.  I got that DVR, and I'm watching that immediately when I get home.  11-way gay orgy to baby Stewie eating a bowl of cereal with horse sperm instead of milk.  Look.  Peter said specifically, some of the milk in the fridge might be horse sperm.  Not all of the milk in the fridge is horse sperm. 
[00:41:00]  Why would there be horse sperm in the fridge?  Well, because Peter was trying to breed his retarded horse.  It was a really good episode.  God damn that family guy.  Too bad Seth is such a boy when he calls our show.  If that isn't enough, the show's leading character is also shown fantasizing about his wife and moaning while a horse licks his bear behind.  Holy shit.  Clearly, the explicit content was not isolated to one instance in one segment of the show. 
[00:41:30]  It permeated the entire program.  Those assholes.  People find it entertaining.  Leave everyone alone, you fucking bunch of holy roll of shitheads.  Plus, it's on Sunday at 9 p.m.  Well, and I'm glad we get an opportunity to tell the people what the PTC is all about again today.  We like to make sure you guys are educated about this group.  The PTC is urging its purported 1.3 million members, this is what they do, by the way, to file FCC complaints against Family Guy.  Here's the problem.  Most of those 1.3 million members never saw the episode that they're going to be complaining about. 
[00:42:00]  Don't they know, though?  Aren't they looking at it differently now that they know where most?  I think over 99% of the FCC complaints come from that group.  Wait, you're 100% right.  Over 99% of all FCC, from that one shit dick group.  I think now the government or the FCC actually takes that into account.  They're like form letters.  Yeah, you can't do that.  This group got away with murder because they were smart.  They social networked their members and like, okay, now we're going after this show for doing this. 
[00:42:30]  It doesn't matter.  You didn't see this show.  And they'll send hundreds of thousands of complaints on a show that they never fucking saw.  We're never offended by.  They were told that they should be offended.  So that's why they sent in a form letter.  Parents watchdog group.  Yeah.  Which goes against the whole FCC.  What is it?  The local standard?  No, what is that one term they use?  It's too early.  It's supposed to be the community standards.  Community standards.  Thank you, Anthony. 
[00:43:00]  And that's not a community standard if it's a lot of people sending form letters that never saw the show.  No.  Now, if, and I still don't agree with this, but if Olsen Family Guy gets a lot of complaints from a whole bunch of different individuals that aren't part of any group, then the FCC would be like, whoa, what the fuck?  They're upsetting the community.  Right, right, right.  But they're not getting it from the community.  They're getting it from an organization.  Exactly, exactly.  Oh, God, are you?  Yeah, the form letters.  It's amazing how they fucking let them get away with so much. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  It's over 99%.  But I bet you the FCC liked them because simply there's the chance to make money with them.  Oh, my God.  I mean, because the more they complain, because you have to have a complaint before I think the FCC can act.  Yeah, yeah.  So they're getting complaints and they can fucking try to throw fines at the radio stations.  Has anyone gotten that $365,000 fine?  I don't think anyone has gotten that since that fine's been put in place.  That wasn't the point.  They were never going to actually enforce that. 
[00:44:00]  No?  The point was to scare the fuck out of everybody.  Well, they did because...  To make sure everyone would play nice.  They made the companies back off.  Yeah, they don't give a shit that they've never thrown that complaint at somebody.  It wasn't about that.  It was the threat.  They did their job.  Extortion.  They scared the shit out of all the broadcasters out there on regular radio, regular TV, and what not.  Mafiosa tactics.  Of course.  I love it.  Seth MacFarlane was asked to comment about the PTC, the Parents Television Council, last year. 
[00:44:30]  Very gassy today.  Too much coffee or something.  Oh, yeah.  This is Seth.  Oh, yeah.  That's like getting hate mail from Hitler.  They're literally terrible human beings.  I've read their newsletter.  I visited their website.  And they're just rotten to the core.  For an organization that prides itself on Christian values, I mean, I'm an atheist, so what do I know?  They spend their entire day hating people.  They can all suck my dick as far as I'm concerned.  Nice. 
[00:45:00]  Seth MacFarlane.  Good for him.  That's a good one.  See?  Good.  Yeah, right on.  Why can't he say stuff like that when he calls our show instead of being off?  Instead of just, well, we do that.  Good for him.  That's the way you should deal with them.  Yeah.  Suck my dick.  And then they'll be like, oh, he actually used an expletive of performing fellatio because  they can't write suck my dick in their little newsletter.  Yeah, right.  They'd have to report themselves.  That would be hilarious.  Oh, we made a mistake. 
[00:45:30]  We got to report ourselves.  We have to report it.  Everybody, just put on your Nikes and cut your testicles off and poison yourself.  We're all good Christians, so now we got to report ourselves and kill ourselves.  I hope that...  Who's the head of that organization?  Some guy?  Tim something?  I don't...  Whatever.  We can go outside and find out.  Oh, no!  We'll explain that after the break because we're going to do a whole segment on that.  We got an update on Tim after the break.  Yeah.  Really fast.  Who's this...  We don't have a name on you.  Family Guy episode was hilarious?  Yeah.  Jim from Canada. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, Jim.  Welcome aboard, Jimmy.  This family...  You know what?  Yeah, go ahead.  This PPC or whatever, they can fuck off.  They put disclaimers every time saying not for, you know, sensitive viewers, parental discretion.  So if you don't like it, you can fuck it back.  Change the channel.  Yeah.  What is the use of putting the disclaimer that they make these people put on?  They make these shows put disclaimers beforehand saying that material is inappropriate  for young children, language...  At the beginning, the show is raided because of language, sexual content, blah, blah, blah.  What's the use of putting that shit on if you're just going to be... 
[00:46:30]  If you're going to get in trouble from some group fucking watching?  Or not even watching, just one person getting info on it and sending it out to their entire group.  And I completely agree with Anthony that, you know, why do we have to cater to the children all the time?  And I'm more of a fan of having kids and stuff than any of these guys, but the fact remains...  Uncle Paul.  You know, why do we always have to cater to the children when there's a lot of adults out there that really enjoy their TV? 
[00:47:00]  Dude, these groups have no concept of adult entertainment.  And I don't mean fucking adult entertainment like walking into a strip club or a peep booth.  I'm talking about entertainment that is completely fine, could be on television, that caters to adult sense of humor.  Why does everything have to cater to children or be safe for children, child safe?  Just stop it.  I want to fucking be entertained by something that isn't this milquetoast bullshit that is safe for the kids. 
[00:47:30]  Go fuck off.  It's really frustrating because, I mean, if you choose to have kids, it's hard work.  Yeah, and part of that job is making sure they don't see stuff that you deem harmful to them.  I don't want to say most people, but a lot of people don't want to do the work after having the kids.  So guess what?  Then all these other groups have to step in and raise your fucking kid for you, which is bullshit.  And by raising your kid, they mean screw over everyone else that wants to have some type of adult conversations, adult entertainment. 
[00:48:00]  And now we've got to sit there and watch kiddie shows.  Right.  I want to see Dora the Explorer bent over and fucked in the ass.  Hey, now.  Who doesn't want to see that?  By fucking Yafit Kodom.  Yafit Kodom.  And this is where the fucking, they're a very conservative group, and this is where the conservatives completely fucking lose me.  It's like they want less government, less government, unless it's with your entertainment or who you stick your dick in.  Yeah.  They're the same people that will say, well, you can't have pornography either, even though that's not like, the excuse for this is, well, it's over the general airwaves. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  People could see it.  Well, how about pornography that you have to go out and purchase?  Well, we don't want that sold.  It's like, it doesn't matter how you get it.  They don't want you to have it.  It doesn't matter.  They just don't want you to have it in the privacy of your own home, behind locked, closed doors, not near a school, not near a church, not near whatever, and they still don't want you to fucking have it.  I hope that's not too political a rant for a whack bag.  Oh, shit.  Those fucking dopes.  What happened?  Just, I don't mind, you know, the message boards. 
[00:49:00]  Get too political.  There's one where the one guy's telling me, I keep changing my opinion.  It's like, sorry.  Changing your opinion?  Sorry, I'm not a fucking slave to any party loyalty.  Sorry, I go back and forth with certain.  Oh, my God.  What are you talking about?  Would I take that as a compliment, dude?  I would take that as a compliment because it means that you're not, yeah, you're not sided to one side, right or left, cemented there by some fucking lunatic. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, Jimmy, there's nothing wrong with being wishy-washy.  I don't.  Waffling is fine.  I think being a bit wishy-washy is perfectly acceptable.  Being a sunflower in a hurricane, I'm very proud of that.  But no.  Oh, wishy-washy, Jim.  It's wishy-washy.  It is actually wishy-washy if you're constantly changing to appease other people or to get out of something.  Right.  But, you know, it's like you fucking, you kind of, you flow and ebb, as they say.  You do.  And your opinions change, yes.  There are some liberal ideas that I actually agree with, conservative ideas that I think are bullshit. 
[00:50:00]  And I will occasionally change my mind based on new information.  Bullshit.  You're a staunch Republican.  No, I'm really not.  You're a staunch.  I come off that way.  You're a staunch.  I'm not.  I play one on the radio.  I'm like a doctor.  I play one on TV.  He's not that staunch, though.  Anthony actually wants abortion to be mandatory.  Yes. 
[00:50:30]  He's a staunch Republican that doesn't agree with some of the big issues that they all agree with.  But, like I said, homo marriage, I could give a flying fuck if those guys want to bang each other left and left.  I always thought you would be against the homo marriage thing.  Love the homo marriage.  Why wouldn't you?  Who cares?  Yeah, I don't care.  It is such a who cares issue to me that I don't fucking give it a second thought.  If gay people want to get married, I find it hysterical when the news covers it and you're watching two burly men holding a fucking bouquet 
[00:51:00]  and kissing each other.  It's a scream.  It's a howl.  It's a panic.  It's a panic.  I love it.  Two fucking women that look like men making out, kissing each other, giving each other rings on their chubby, fat little lesbian fingers.  I love that shit.  They're women.  It looks like David Bowie in Spaulding Gray.  It's a horrible eye, but it's entertaining as hell.  Get married.  Who cares? 
[00:51:30]  I'm Harvey Milk.  And I want to recruit you.  And then the...  What was it?  A playful spanking?  A playful...  Oh, it was such hijinks in Harvey's bed in that camera store where you could fucking skate to the bedroom on the jizz on the floor.  You could fucking Hans Christian Andersen your way into the bedroom because he fucked anything that moved.  Yeah, he was a bad boy.  Jesus H. Christ.  That guy... 
[00:52:00]  You don't swing at every pitch there, Harvey.  Every single one.  Sometimes you let one fly by you.  That Harvey Milk outside of his place after his boyfriend leaves is some fucking drugged out Hispanic youngster.  And he invites him into the camera store to talk politics with him a little bit, I guess.  He swings at all balls.  Yeah, all the balls he's swinging at.  The next scene, they're frolicking.  Yeah.  They're frolicking completely nude on a mattress and playfully spanking each other's buttocks as one is trying to get away from the other. 
[00:52:30]  But, Harvey, I have you.  He's grabbing him by the ankles, pulling him back and playfully spanking his behind.  You know, we all have our lines.  In that movie, I'm like, all right, all right, okay, all right.  I'm like hanging in there and they're like, all right, that's my line.  The playful spanking was my line.  Was that?  I think...  Yeah.  It was when Sean Penn did the one and only deep... 
[00:53:00]  The kiss?  The deep mouth kiss.  It was when I was like, uh, all right.  You know what it is?  I was expecting that kind of.  Well, you knew there was going to be a few of those.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was like, all right.  And then that, to me, it brought out the Sean Penn part.  That was where it departed because he did a great job of becoming another character.  Right.  But that part, all I could think of was, holy shit, here's Sean Penn kissing another guy.  Right.  It kind of almost took me out of the movie with him doing such a great job as Harvey Milk. 
[00:53:30]  The part where he's spanking his lover was so playful and gay.  That's what got me.  Just spanking.  A little spanking.  You know if he flipped over that unclipped fucking huge jiggle?  He was playfully swatting the buttocks of his lover.  Yes.  Of his male, his gentleman caller.  Playfully swatting the buttocks.  Swatting.  I like to look a lot deeper at things.  Do ya?  And I'm thinking Sean Penn, right? 
[00:54:00]  Let's go with that scene.  He's playfully spanking the dude in bed.  I'm like, is there anyone on set going, oh my god, he does that a little too well.  He's really getting into that.  Wow.  Is that real acting chops or what the fuck?  Is that based on something that we don't know about?  You gotta think someone is thinking that.  And do you just run off and wash your hands immediately, Purellum, just to look like,  eh, it was just all of a man-ass?  I think I would just, of course, start picking my nose.  Or do you go to craft services and start like deep-throating hot dogs with the smell 
[00:54:30]  of onion on your hand?  You take the hot dogs, you dip them in pudding, and then you walk around going, and you laugh.  And you laugh.  But you think as an actor, you throw a little something in there that shows, oh, nah, I'm  hetero.  I'm really just acting, obviously.  I fucked Madonna.  You make believe, like, wait, do you spank it?  Like, what?  Yeah, how do you do this?  Like, would a gay guy do it this way?  Can we get the gay consultant in here?  I'm a little confused instead of just going, oh, I know exactly what I'm doing. 
[00:55:00]  You're not doing it right.  Right.  All right.  Yeah, the gay coach.  Like, they have a voice coach and dialect coach, things like that.  You have the gay coach for how you spank another man's hiney.  Because the one man tried to crawl away, but then Sean pulled him back and playfully swatted  Oh, did he ever.  The tender backside of his gentleman collar.  Creepy.  Anthony, someone is reworking your Harvey Milk line.  Yes.  I mean, it's not yours, but you do it very well.  Oh, Kevin from Connecticut, who's pretty much our number one instant feedbacker these days. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  Steven S has dropped down to third.  I'm Harvey Milk, and I want to...  Oh, I messed it up.  I'm Harvey, and I want to milk you.  Fuck.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Ruining Kevin's great line.  Another flub.  I'm Harvey, and I want to milk you.  Nice.  We've talked about this break, but we've done, like, this subject before, but I actually asked  the audience last night, and it was a bizarre thing about, would you rather kiss a guy lovingly? 
[00:56:00]  Like, I was talking about prison rape.  Would you rather kiss a guy lovingly, or would you rather suck a dick?  Like, what would be easier for you to do?  What did your parents say?  Well, my father said, my father too quickly said, suck the dick, before I even got the  question out, which really bothered me, because I said, would you rather, and he didn't know  where I was going.  I was going to say drive a Ford or drive a Chevy, but I said, would you rather, and dad  went, suck the dick, and I'm like, yes, that's what I was going to say.  Suck the dick or die. 
[00:56:30]  You know, dad's always chomping the gun.  No, it was, uh...  There's just no answer to that.  Well, it's just, you know, the crowd was like...  So you're in prison.  Oh, you said this to the crowd?  Oh, yeah, I was on stage.  And it was, uh...  It was, like, what would be worse, because the kissing part is, it's more the view.  Like, the fact that you're kissing, of course, I talked about the hand holding the head,  and how I'd probably just stare at the eyebrow of the other man, but, like, if you suck  in the dick, there's really no good view either.  It's like, what are you looking at, the belly button or the toes?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's like ten little, ten things just accusing you. 
[00:57:00]  And then, you don't want to shut your eyes, because you don't want to look like you're  enjoying it.  Right.  But you don't want to watch.  You don't want to see what you're seeing when that's happening.  I'd hate to be sucking the dick, and you see the toes point down like you know he's trying  to cum.  When you're clenching your I gotta cum muscles.  Oh, my God.  You're clenching those I wanna cum muscles.  Oh, my God.  What are those connected to, that that works?  I don't know, but in order for me to cum sometimes, my tootsies are pointed straight out. 
[00:57:30]  You have to, like, stretch certain muscles and clench your ass, maybe, or do the deep  fucking thrust.  Yeah, they were a little uncomfortable.  That's fucking funny, too.  Yeah.  Who actually presented that to the audience?  That's great.  Oh, it's fantastic.  You're an asshole.  I'm very pleased with myself.  I'm very graphic.  Yeah, I bet.  They weren't happy.  Steven S1 wants to know.  Well, Steven S, you are third. 
[00:58:00]  Blue Heeler's number two at this point.  Yeah.  Let them fight it out a little bit.  Internet wars.  They were goofing on.  Social networking wars.  They were goofing on Steven S last night on PalTalk saying, Steven, shouldn't you get  to bed?  Don't you have to get up and do the show rundown?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Oh.  How perfect was it that the show rundown was like, I heard it went all the way up to  number two.  Yeah.  In Google Trends.  So Steven S finally gets this massive exposure for what he's doing. 
[00:58:30]  And then.  And it's over.  The other.  The other shoe drop.  Yeah, we'll talk about that next.  This is a good place to take a break.  We got an update on Tim.  And we have an update on what they replaced us with.  It's official.  Oh, fantastic.  I was going to say they're rocking.  They're not rocking.  They're playing the pop music.  Watching Bertie Madoff on his way to the federal courthouse in an SUV.  They have a helicopter, I guess.  He seems to be speeding, doesn't he?  Yeah, no kidding. 
[00:59:00]  They're in an awful hurry to get him there.  Yeah.  What do they got?  Like cars following him and helicopters?  Cell phone video.  Jesus.  Yeah.  We know what it looks like.  A guy in a car.  Yeah.  There's nothing.  It's blacked out windows, so you can't even see him.  Well, that's the latest thing.  A fiery wreck would be fantastic.  How would it be?  Terrific.  Would that be?  To just see a firing Bernie Madoff.  Ow!  Ow!  Running out of the vehicle on fire.  He is speeding.  And people are gathering at where?  The federal courthouse for his arrival? 
[00:59:30]  They're passing everybody.  A thousand bucks to anyone who punches him in the face today.  I don't think you could actually put a physical threat out for money over the air.  I'm a radio shock jock.  I was joking.  That's shocking.  I was joking.  It's a parody.  Yes.  Look at him.  He's hungry.  Who's driving this drunk?  Who's the drunk at the wheel?  By the way, because I don't want to get fired.  Please don't do that.  I don't feel like getting fired.  No.  It was easy to get fired when you had two jobs.  Now when you have one, oof. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Oof.  It's a little rough.  Oof.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll see what Bernie Madoff is all about as he makes his way to federal court.  I want to see a cop do a pit maneuver on him.  Yeah.  Just flip him over.  Colin's coming in today, too.  Colin?  Quinn?  And also, Colin will be in a little while.  And also, Waddle and George.  Right.  Nice.  And Terry Shappert.  Oh, Shivo.  No, no.  Terry Shivo, we were going to have in.  Her wheel in those bones.  Yeah.  They're smarter than they were before they pulled the plug.  Yes.  And then we were going to fucking, her brain, or as I call it, a Jasper. 
[01:00:30]  Is that the right word?  An Aggie?  Is Jasper right?  The Marble?  Yeah.  I think they were Jaspers and Aggies.  And he'll be in.  I didn't see the Warrior TV show, but.  Oh, yeah.  Did you see it?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You didn't see it?  No, no.  I did.  It was good.  Did you really see it?  Oh, it's fantastic.  What is it about?  It's about warriors over history and how they.  The only reason we said yes to them, because you were supposed to watch it. 
[01:01:00]  You know what?  Half the fun is learning about the program from the star.  That's the only reason, though.  We said, fuck this guy.  And he goes, no, watch the show.  I'm going to watch the show, or I'm going to pop on Starship Troopers in the big screen.  You tell me.  Giant bugs fucking chopping people in half on an 11-foot screen or a fucking warrior show  on regular TV.  And we reminded you three times.  Oh, my God.  Fuck that.  Oh, that's going to suck later.  Do you know what I want to see?  Tell Terry not to show up.  I want to watch fucking horror movies on 11-foot screen. 
[01:01:30]  Tell Terry and his stupid warriors to beat us.  Oh, he's like a Special Forces guy.  Whatever.  Yes.  I'm not tangling with him.  Whatever.  Yes.  Whatever.  Tell him to take out that window and hit the streets.  Hit the bricks running.  Yeah, we don't need you today.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
