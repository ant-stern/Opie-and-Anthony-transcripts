<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often interweaving them with vulgar language and offensive humor.  The show began with a discussion of the 2008 Democratic primaries, focusing on Barack Obama’s success against Hillary Clinton, President Bush's endorsement of John McCain, and speculation about Obama’s potential victory.  This transitioned into commentary on the controversy surrounding MSNBC’s David Shuster's use of the phrase "pimped out" regarding Chelsea Clinton, including the subsequent apology and reactions from Hillary Clinton and Keith Olbermann.  The Grammy Awards were heavily dissected, with commentary on winners like Herbie Hancock and Amy Winehouse, and significant mockery of Kanye West’s acceptance speech.  Other news items covered included Roger Clemens' wife's alleged PED use, Nas's Grammy attire featuring a racial slur, and Tony Bennett’s rambling red carpet interview.  The hosts also briefly touched on their “Black History Month” segment, featuring the Jive Dudes from *Airplane*, and the death of Roy Scheider.  A staffer, Tim, was mentioned as being present in the studio.

The show then featured an in-studio interview with rapper Nas, whose new album title used the n-word, sparking a debate about its usage and censorship. This was followed by Jim Norton sharing a humorous anecdote about cleaning his rifle in bed topless, which frightened his girlfriend.  Listeners called in, and the show briefly mentioned Bill Burr’s upcoming appearance on *Letterman* and animated downloads on iTunes.  The criticism of Keith Olbermann's apology for David Shuster's comment resurfaced, with the hosts highlighting its perceived hypocrisy.  The show also included a segment on a "How to Look Your Best Naked" article and television show, featuring mockery of the show's premise, host Carson Kressley, and its portrayal of overweight women, interspersed with listener calls and humorous tangents.  The “FU Line” segment and a comedic Black History Month tribute to Sherry Shepard were also included, along with another mention of Roy Scheider's death and a discussion of a 1968 "Pie Face" commercial.

A segment featuring a stripper named Amber trying on bras followed, with humorous descriptions of ill-fitting bras and their effects on body shape.  The show then discussed the deaths of Roy Scheider and Heath Ledger (including morbid details of his burial), and Pat O'Brien's return to rehab, with sexually suggestive jokes.  A graphic description of hockey player Richard Zednik’s neck laceration dominated a portion of the show,  compared to a Tarantino film,  leading to discussion of Vince McMahon's involvement in the NHL and jokes about staging violence for entertainment.  Gary Galley's similar incident was also mentioned.  Other news segments covered a high school basketball team forcing a teammate into sexual acts, Heather Mills' divorce from Paul McCartney, child abuse charges related to a home circumcision, an “Oscar Moments” segment referencing *No Country for Old Men*, a Chicago radio host suspended for an anti-Semitic remark, an Iraq War veteran missing after a PTSD trigger from *Call of Duty*, the upcoming US Presidential election, John McCain's war experiences and use of the term "gook," and (again) Bill Burr's upcoming appearance on *Letterman*.  Finally, Anthony's new hybrid car was discussed, including humorous anecdotes about an encounter with an old man and comparisons to *The Truman Show*.  The show concluded with reminiscences about the lax security and societal attitudes of the 1970s, including anecdotes about drunk driving and lenient police interactions.

A significant portion involved listener calls recounting questionable or illegal activities from their pasts, often set in the 1970s, including encounters with police, a driver's ed instructor drinking while teaching, a history teacher allowing students to fire a .50 caliber musket, and widespread gun ownership in high schools.  Comedian Bill Burr appeared in-studio, and the conversation shifted to a news story about a murdered transgender prostitute,  followed by graphic commentary on an S&M club incident. The discussion then veered into various sexual fetishes and preferences, with explicit descriptions from a caller and Mistress Roxanne, a phone sex worker who joined the show. Mistress Roxanne engaged in a phone sex role-play with a shy intern, Adam.  The segment concluded with more listener calls and jokes about the murdered bride.

A phone interview with Mistress Roxanne followed, discussing the legality and company policy surrounding the portrayal of various sexual acts on air, including age play and incest (stated as a joke).  The conversation covered her experiences, unusual client requests, the connection between S&M and sexual gratification, and the training involved in her profession.  Callers phoned in, one mimicking "Uncle Paul," another introducing "super kids."  Mistress Roxanne provided her contact information, and the segment concluded with more off-color jokes and comments.  A school shooting in Memphis, Tennessee was also mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go, screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infinite DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  They all gives you a strip club advice,  And then you go and see The Little Mermaid the next day.  It's not like I went with a gay guy.  It's your girlfriend, Dad.  It was you. 
[00:01:00]  I think if you were touched inappropriately,  you would make it like a quick pop song,  like the Beatles used to do in the Love, Love, Me, Don't.  Yeah, right.  They're like, sit, freeze.  Tell us what happened.  I had a patient who was a college student  and was really, really depressed,  and he killed himself.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Finally.  My God.  Wow.  That's a long intro.  No kidding.  What time is it, Tuesday?  That is a long production piece here in New York City.  What, they didn't have another Zeppelin song to play?  Let's play another Zeppelin song.  Get us to 6 o'clock so we can start our radio show.  Yes.  Hi.  Good morning.  All right, what the hell is going on out there?  You got Herbie Hancock winning Album of the Year. 
[00:02:00]  What year is this?  And you got Barack Obama winning Maine.  What year is this?  What is going on in this world?  Maine.  Did the...  I guess the black vote really came out in force in Maine.  Both of them.  Barack won Maine, huh?  I guess all the moosin' kept the white people home.  Moosin.  All the moosin'.  And apparently he also won the urban Mecca known as Nebraska.  I told you, bro. 
[00:02:30]  It's over.  It's over.  A perfect storm is forming.  Yeah.  Even I'm seeing it.  Barack Obama is now kicking Clinton's ass.  Even I'm seeing it.  Although they say it's neck and neck.  Yeah, but...  It's really not neck and neck because there's a lot of states coming up that Obama is definitely  going to win.  And she really needed to win some of these states over the weekend.  Yeah, she's just crying now to try to get the vote.  Presidential.  Huh?  No.  Presidential and she cries.  She's crying.  She thinks getting emotional and seeing people look at her like a human being is a good thing. 
[00:03:00]  Maybe once.  Tear up a little bit.  She is just bawling now at the drop of a hat.  She's replaced her campaign manager, if you've noticed.  Yes, I did.  From a white woman to a black woman now is her campaign manager.  I think that is a racially strategic move.  And she's now using a Cain West song as...  Cain West.  As opposed to Kanye.  I say Cain.  Oh, okay.  Because I'm white.  Okay. 
[00:03:30]  It looks like Cain to me.  Cain West.  All right, Kanye West.  Sure.  Yeah, he's...  What is that?  The official song?  Yeah, the official song for the Clinton campaign.  The campaign is now a Kanye West song.  Yeah, she's trying to get it together really fast here.  She's trying to get the urban...  With the black people.  And this is really bad.  McCain, who is being criticized by the party for not being conservative enough, has picked  up an endorsement that is sure to put him over the top.  Like I said, a perfect storm is forming.  Here's another piece right here. 
[00:04:00]  President Bush has come and put his support behind McCain.  I guess President Bush really wants Obama in the White House.  It's...  That's the kiss of death right there for a candidate.  It just goes to show...  Now the Democrats could just come out and go, if you want more of the same that we've  had under Bush, you just vote for McCain.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Huckabee.  Huckabee.  He's still trying.  It really doesn't have much of a chance.  Yeah, but he's going to try to save the party. 
[00:04:30]  Save the party.  That's the only reason he's still in it.  The only party they're saving is the one that's being thrown at Obama's when the election's  over.  Huckabee.  Well, it refuses to bail out.  McCain, his wheels are starting to get a little shaky.  They're getting a little wobbly.  Yeah.  McCain is going to fall apart in the next month or two.  You watch.  And Hillary's got to throw in five mil of our own money to keep our campaign going with  people not being paid.  And Obama is breaking records with collecting money. 
[00:05:00]  It is over, Johnny.  We are really looking at the first African-American president in the United States history.  No, it's not.  You think he wanted George Bush's endorsement?  Bush is like, I'm going to endorse you.  He's like, you want to take the weekend and think it out?  Yeah, you really might want to just think this over.  No rush, sir.  Yeah, there were a lot of groans in Washington when that happened.  They were really trying because McCain isn't coming across as a conservative.  And for some reason, the Republican candidate has to be a conservative for some reason. 
[00:05:30]  It's ridiculous to think that.  So Bush came out and said, oh, McCain is a true conservative.  Great.  That'll help him.  So what are we going to be looking at come November?  Obama.  President Obama.  It's a Obama.  I started that.  President Barack Hussein Obama.  That's right.  Is that what we're looking at?  The United States of America. 
[00:06:00]  President Barack.  He won Maine and Nebraska.  OK, I know.  Let's say that again.  Maine and Nebraska.  Yeah, it killed poor Roy Scheider.  Yeah, Roy Scheider.  Roy Scheider, if you're just waking up, is dead at 75.  It sounds like what?  Skin cancer?  Oh, he had all kinds of the cancer.  Did he?  Oh, yeah.  He had like three different types over the past few years.  Pieces were falling off his body.  But Roy Scheider, some of the headlines as you wake up, is dead at the age of 75. 
[00:06:30]  Of course, one of the stars of Jaws.  Now people are talking.  Is it a cursed movie?  Actually, they're not.  He died.  Yes.  Dreyfus will someday.  Yes.  That's right.  And Robert Shaw died.  And the Spielberg has done nothing since.  And of course, the shark died, too.  Yes, the shark is dead.  Yeah.  Curse movie.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  Perfect time in Iraq.  Get that off the air. 
[00:07:00]  What's he playing?  If that was Jaws music, I'm going to go over there and bite his computer string.  Can you turn that light on, my love?  I can't see no under.  Why are the Jaws music way late?  It was playing.  It was just low.  Oh.  Well, if it was playing, but it's real low, then it really wasn't playing.  Thank you.  I want to thank the people of Maine.  We have now won on the Atlantic coast.  We've won in the Gulf coast.  We've won on the Pacific coast.  And we won in between those coasts.  His Maine victory comes just one night after he won contests in Washington State, Nebraska, and Louisiana. 
[00:07:30]  Next, Obama and Clinton will square off in Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. Tuesday.  Both candidates have been campaigning in the Potomac States, trying to round up last-minute support.  Despite Obama's weekend victories, Clinton still has a slight lead in the delegate count.  The candidate has to get 2,025 delegates to capture the Democratic nomination for the White House.  1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock.  But rock around the clock tonight!  Put your glad racks on and join me, hon. 
[00:08:00]  We'll have some fun when the clock's rocks.  When we're gonna rock around the clock tonight.  Rock tonight, yeah.  Rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight.  Race ward!  Race ward!  Race ward!  I was only joking.  Race ward!  I was only joking.  Race ward!  I was only joking.  Rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the rocks tonight.  Race ward! 
[00:08:30]  I was only joking.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  Oh!  Oh!  Race ward!  Race ward!  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  We're gonna rock around the rock tonight.  Rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the rock tonight.  Rocking around Barack. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, it's 8, 9, 10, 11, 2.  I'll be going strong and slow with you.  We're gonna rock around the rock.  We're gonna rock around the rock tonight.  Say pull, pull this.  Yes.  We're gonna rock around the rock tonight.  Revolution, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning.  That's an attention gift.  Woo-hoo!  Let's rock around Barack.  It's happening. 
[00:09:30]  It is happening.  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out the bushes!  We're gonna rock around the rock tonight.  We're going to rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're going to rock, going to rock around Barack tonight.  He stinks and I don't like him.  Let my people go.  And there you have it.  Yes, Obama with a fine, fine weekend. 
[00:10:00]  You hear what's going on with Chelsea Clinton too?  Yes, a little controversy.  I love controversy.  But there's a lot of people out there that are just out of touch.  Yeah.  The whole pimp it out thing is part of language now.  Yeah, it doesn't literally mean you are a pimp and you are pimping out a bitch.  It's an expression that is used when somebody is using someone for a specific purpose for their own means.  And the Clintons were being accused of pimping out Chelsea, their daughter, for Hillary's sake. 
[00:10:30]  You know, get her out there.  It kind of trying to get the youth vote, I guess, away from Obama.  She's very articulate.  She's young, obviously.  And it's a good strategic move for them.  But if you say they are pimping her out, apparently you get suspended. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It's a very bad thing to do because people took it literally.  Like Bill is out there on the street corner.  Like there was going to be a lot of eye shadow.  You like that?  A lot of mascara.  He's in a doorway.  Yeah.  Like Harvey Keitel in Taxi.  And, yeah, they got a little mad.  Yeah.  And what's his name from CNBC?  David Schuster.  Fred Fired.  Well, then you get, we'll get into it in a second. 
[00:11:30]  But, yes, before we, we've got to back up slightly.  I forgot about this.  Rob in D.C.  Go ahead, Rob.  Hey, morning, boys.  Good morning.  I just wanted to let you know that Obama won a Grammy last night.  He's unstoppable.  Yeah, this guy can't lose, man.  He's unstoppable.  He also got a Grammy over Bill Clinton, I believe, right?  I think Bill Clinton was up for a Grammy, and so was Obama.  Yeah.  And Obama beat Clinton again.  In the hip-hop category?  In the hip-hop.  Yeah.  What category?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  What was this fun category? 
[00:12:00]  They did something there.  What was this category?  Spoken word.  Spoken word.  Books on tape award, basically.  That's pretty much it.  Someone got a books on tape award.  And the Grammy for the best book on tape.  The ending's not nominated for that.  Yeah, I don't know why, Jimmy.  Come on.  Leave it.  All right.  Here's the actual comment that was made on MSNBC.  All right.  Let's hear how.  She's working for her mom.  What's unseemly about that?  I mean, during the last campaign, the Bush twins were out working for their dad.  I think it's great. 
[00:12:30]  I think she's grown up in a political family.  She's got politics in her blood.  She loves her mom.  She thinks she'd make a great president.  Michelle Obama's out there for her husband.  But doesn't it seem like Chelsea's sort of being pimped out in some weird sort of way?  No.  She's there.  Listen, if she didn't want to be there, she wouldn't be there.  I mean, give Chelsea a break.  That is one of the most innocent remarks I've ever heard get criticized.  That means nothing.  Pimped out is an expression that is just being used, especially by the youth of America. 
[00:13:00]  Yes, the youth.  Pimped out.  And then this is Hillary reacting to that.  You know, I am a mom first and a candidate second.  Are you?  Oh, boy.  Get the tissues out.  She forgot what she is.  No, she's a mom second, a candidate third, and a C first.  You can't get to B if you don't start at A, Hill.  I'm amazed you had time to actually speak in between all those tears.  Yes.  All those tears. 
[00:13:30]  But I want to be president.  But it was my turn.  It's like voting for Timothy Hutton and ordinary people.  We get it.  You said.  Constantly.  All right.  Enough.  You know, I am a mom first and a candidate second.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  I'm a mom first.  Well, guess what?  Mom first.  I don't want to vote for a mom first. 
[00:14:00]  No.  In the White House.  No.  See, you may be a mom first in your brain, but you don't want to tell potential voters  that you're.  Actually, I'm a mom first.  So if Chelsea skins a knee, I'm going to have to blow off the big meeting down there in  D.C. with whoever.  Yes.  Sorry.  I'd love to find out more about that Middle East situation.  But Chelsea's she needs a little talking.  But Chelsea's mom.  But Chelsea's home from work today with a with a fever of 102.  So I got to be a mom first.  I got to be a mom first. 
[00:14:30]  I got to know.  I got to pack her lunch.  You can't be a mom first when you're the president.  You know what you are?  The president first.  That's right.  That's it.  Look at Bush.  I mean, the guy aged 80 years.  Oh, my God.  It's a mess.  Because he was the president first.  Yes.  What he is first.  Well, I'd say he didn't do a good job.  But I mean, he at least at least he looked at is the only thing he he was supposed to  do.  Right.  Here's here's Hillary.  You know, I am a mom first and a candidate second.  Oh, boy.  And I found the remarks incredibly offensive. 
[00:15:00]  You know, I can take whatever comes my way.  That's part of what I signed up for as a candidate.  What about your husband getting a little treat in the Oval Office?  I think that there's been a troubling pattern of comments and behavior that has to be held  accountable.  So I have sent a letter to the head of NBC expressing the deep offense that I took and 
[00:15:30]  pointing out what has been a troubling pattern of demeaning treatment.  And I would expect appropriate action to be taken.  Oh, my God.  There was are they going to fire this guy?  They just trying to get the sympathy is what she's doing.  She wants a little sympathy.  She wants moms to gather around her and say, look, yes, I agree with that.  I have a daughter.  I'm going to vote for her now.  Well, let's not forget.  I'm his work for MSNBC.  This is on MSNBC. 
[00:16:00]  So, you know, probably probably the guy has to get fired now.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  And which would be ridiculous.  Now you got Schuster.  He he had to go and apologize for his remark.  Last night during the show.  Last night during the show.  Last night during the show.  Last night during the show.  Oh, where's my apology?  I got to read it.  I said something that might have been deemed a foul.  Last night during the show. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  You know, he's all nervous having to do this.  So, he wanted to really sound like he was full of energy and didn't mind saying it.  Don't you know you're supposed to just read Apologies?  Just read it.  Just read it.  Read it with insincerity.  And then crumple it up in the background and hear it hit a wall.  Exactly.  And then move on with the radio.  I mean, the show.  What?  We know you don't mean it. 
[00:17:00]  We know you don't mean it.  Linger longer.  Last night during the show.  Ah, baby, baby.  Last night during the show, I spoke about Chelsea Clinton.  I love this guy.  Last night during the show.  I talked about Chelsea Clinton.  Last night during the show, I spoke about Chelsea Clinton and noted the affection that so many of us have for her.  I love her.  Phone calls she has made to superdelegates to convince them to support her mom. 
[00:17:30]  In describing this effort, I used a phrase that was inappropriate.  The C word.  Now, that would have been inappropriate.  And I said I'd like to F her.  What a...  Oh, this guy's...  How smarmy.  Oh, just smarmy.  That's the word.  And he can't even say pimping out.  No.  Yeah.  I used the term oopsie.  Yes.  I used the term pimping out, which normally is what you do with a prostitute.  We want her to go perform sexual favors and give you the money. 
[00:18:00]  This was inappropriate.  When did I say this?  Yeah, what?  When did I say this?  Last night.  I don't do impressions.  That one's an easy one, though.  Come on, Jimmy.  Try it.  Last night.  However...  Last night, Sam.  I apologize to the Clinton family, the Clinton campaign, and all of you who were justifiably  offended.  I made comments I shouldn't have. 
[00:18:30]  No music.  It's brief.  Here it is.  A phrase that was inappropriate.  And I apologize to the Clinton family, the Clinton campaign, and all of you who were  justifiably offended.  All Americans should be proud of Chelsea Clinton.  And I'm particularly sorry that my language diminished the regard and respect she has earned  from all of us and the respect her parents have earned in how they raised her.  Did he punch her?  That's pretty much the only thing that justifies that apology. 
[00:19:00]  Wow.  He apologized to everyone.  God.  In the whole world.  Way to know pop culture.  That pimping out thing is being used all over the place these days.  And first...  And she wasn't paid.  Chelsea's not getting paid to, you know...  No.  ...to talk on her mom's behalf.  She's just calling up the superdelegates.  Meanwhile, the superdelegates are on the phone.  And she's calling him up and, you know, trying to get her mom in there.  She'll win.  Do superdelegates raise superkids, do you think? 
[00:19:30]  Superkids, yes.  A race of superkids.  I'm Chelsea Clinton, though, only because she's completely...  She's awesome, man.  ...stayed out of the...  Like, she talks to no press.  Yeah.  Which I like, because she just completely will not acknowledge the press.  Occasionally, she is caught canoodling, which is nice.  Sometimes she'll canoodle.  Kind of hot.  Yeah, very sexy.  When that happens.  Naughty presidential girl.  Well, hard to get in there, isn't it?  It doesn't end there.  Boy, I bet.  I got one more clip here.  Keith Olbermann. 
[00:20:00]  A man I hate.  Yeah, I really hate him, too, now.  I hate Keith Olbermann.  He's a...  Yeah.  He talks a good game behind closed doors to bosses and stuff when he has a TV show  to express his disgust during a situation.  I'm talking, of course, about the Ima situation.  He came...  Yeah.  Behind the scenes, he was yelling and screaming that Ima should be...  He fired.  Yeah.  Because he was too scared.  He wasn't sure how much power Ima's had.  And then when Ima's was officially fired, then he went on the air and said, well, I was 
[00:20:30]  instrumental in this.  I was talking to the bosses behind the scenes in his office, yelling and screaming that  this man should be fired.  You have a TV show every night.  Why didn't you say all this right off the bat?  Hence, the hate for Keith Olbermann.  He's a phony.  Jealous that Imus was obviously more known than he was on that network.  Yep.  And Imus was the big dog, and he wasn't.  Right.  And he's just a pontificating jerk-off.  And, well, he has to get involved with this.  Of course.  Of course.  Because I guess he's the main guy at MSNBC now.  I don't know.  And now you have probably heard that on this network yesterday, my colleague David Schuster, 
[00:21:00]  discussing Chelsea Clinton's role, a first for her in her mother's campaign, asked a  guest, quote, doesn't it seem like Chelsea's sort of being pimped...  This isn't his story, man.  Quote.  Well, he's got to attach himself to it.  Quote, doesn't it seem like Chelsea's sort of being pimped out in some weird sort of  way?  At the greatest possible respect for David Schuster's work, his reporting for this show and others  is assiduous and excellent, and his political insight is keen.  Big words.  All that being noted, it was still an utterly inappropriate and indefensible thing to say. 
[00:21:30]  What?  Clintons have every right to be furious, hurt, and appalled.  Many of us here have similar reactions, ones that transcend political parties and politics  itself.  Holy Jesus.  David has been suspended.  It remains only for me to apologize without limit to President Clinton, to Senator Clinton,  and to Ms. Clinton on behalf of MSNBC.  We are literally, dreadfully sorry.  Oh, go back yourself.  Dreadfully sorry.  What a worm.  Could you imagine us ever saying we are literally, dreadfully sorry? 
[00:22:00]  No, this is the type of guy you would have gave wedgies to on the playground.  Just a goody two-shoes running to the teacher.  Trying so hard to come off as a, as a spokesman for the network.  Yeah.  The guy who's going to set it straight.  I'll set it straight.  I literally, dreadfully.  What the hell did they, did he say?  Nothing.  It wasn't that bad.  He said nothing.  In the context that it was said, it's not that bad. 
[00:22:30]  And, and MSNBC is barely the news, so why don't you relax?  I mean, who's, who's really watching?  You're one step above like MTV.  Don't, don't try to act like you're a real news organization.  Wow.  Dreadfully sorry.  Dreadfully.  Isn't he just a deuce?  How about this?  We're literally dreadful.  You could stop there.  Can we, can we, can we cut that up?  They're literally dreadful.  Oh, he just sucks.  They all suck.  Cause then people are going to think that we like O'Reilly. 
[00:23:00]  He's just as bad, if not worse.  O'Reilly's a jerk off too, but at least O'Reilly, I'll say this for him as much of a, he's not  as big of a, of a, of a worm as Oberyn seems to be.  He just seems to be like one of those behind the scene little bitches.  They are both bad in different ways, like equally as despicable in different ways.  O'Reilly is just an ass.  I see him, my personal opinion of him is that he, uh, fibs, he's a fibber and he backpedals. 
[00:23:30]  But, but, uh, his facts are his, but it's the no spin zone.  No spin zone.  But it's the no spin zone.  You throw up from the spins just watching his show.  I get a little nauseous.  It's, he spins everything.  Yeah.  When you call your show the no spin zone, that means you're spinning a lot.  You are just like a top.  He is spinning round and round.  Right into the suck zone.  You're in the no spin zone. 
[00:24:00]  Whoa.  Really?  Broadcast live from the teacup ride.  Right.  Must be the perspective inside the teacup.  Yeah.  I guess if you're in the actual teacup.  Relative to the teacup, I'm not spinning.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  Oh, I hate them all.  Anyway.  All right.  Well, that's, uh, that, that's how we start today.  We have lots to do.  We have, uh, Grammy, uh, stuff.  A little bit of that after the break.  We also have, uh.  I call her Grandma.  Grandma?  Yeah.  Oh. 
[00:24:30]  Thank you.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I get yelled at.  I get yelled at on a radio show one time before I did you guys ever.  This is like, you know, 10 years ago.  I called up this radio show in New York.  They're from Cincinnati, Ohio.  And they were doing, uh, you know, the Grammys.  And so I had no radio experience.  So I called in and I was doing my Keanu Reeves sucks jokes.  And they're like, uh, and, uh, I knew I was in trouble when they said, uh, I heard  them off air talking in the phone.  They're like, all right, should we call them the grandmas instead of the Grammys?  Okay, we'll call them the grandmas.  And then they brought me on and I was like, this is going to be ugly. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, swing and a miss, swing and a miss, swing and a miss, swing and a miss.  Strike one, strike two, strike three.  Didn't go well.  You know what the bit is?  A lot of radio shows used to do the Grammys and they would have grandmas call in and sing  the nominated songs.  No, they wouldn't.  Oh yeah.  Can I give it up?  Stop.  Yeah.  They would call it the Grammys because you would call your grandma.  Yeah.  I think I got to leave the business.  So all of a sudden it would be a, uh, uh, uh, like a popular hip hop song. 
[00:25:30]  Your Grammy is channel, uh, 11 here locally still showing that hockey clip.  Yeah.  We'll talk about that after the break.  Yeah.  That's a good tease.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hit that button, you rock, before I punch you.  You know what everyone else is talking about?  ONA Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Moving fast today.  Uh, Shirley Truck Driver from Tennessee writes, 
[00:26:00]  No Spin Zone brought to you by Rats Round and Round.  Mmm.  I like that.  Mmm.  We got instant feedback all over the place.  We got one on ONA Radio dot com, uh, dot com?  Dot com, that's the new one.  Dot com?  Dot com is the new one.  On A Radio dot com, but I don't think that's the one we actually look at.  No?  And we don't have any bosses, so, ah, I don't know what to tell you.  Then we got a website that is named after this show.  We're not allowed to promote that.  Ah, I don't know what to tell you about that one. 
[00:26:30]  It's a wacky world.  But I think on that one, we got the instant feedback that we do read.  So, you make sense of all that.  Oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop.  Phone number.  That works.  877-212-ON-A.  We got a Grammy moment here from Tim from down the hall.  An O-N-A post-Grammy moment.  It was an upset at last night's Grammy Awards when Herbie Hancock took home the statue for  Album of the Year for his River, the Joanie Letters. 
[00:27:00]  I wish I had a river.  I could skate away on.  Oh, no.  But it was Amy Winehouse who ruled the evening with five Grammys, including Song of the Year  and Record of the Year for her autobiographical song, Rehab.  They try to take a note to rehab.  I said, no, no, no.  Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you won't know, no, no. 
[00:27:30]  The sultry sounds of Amy Winehouse.  A Grammy moment.  I'm Tim, the guy down the hall, on the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, well.  I wound up liking that one.  I didn't plan on it, believe me.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm a big fan of them.  Oh, what do you think they're going to do?  When he does it live in front of us, it feels like I'm looking at a famous person.  Absolutely.  This is the voice guy.  Well, the Grammys were last night, and boy, were they exciting, I got to tell you. 
[00:28:00]  Wow.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it was just like last year, the year before that.  Just the music changes a little bit.  Yeah, same garbage.  A record of the year was, yeah, Rehab by Amy Winehouse.  And then you had album of the year, Herbie Hancock.  What?  What?  All I know of Herbie Hancock.  He's a one-hit wonder.  Is that song where the mannequins were mechanical mannequins on the video back in the early 80s. 
[00:28:30]  And E-Rock's got it right here, right?  Why wouldn't you have it?  What's that called?  Yeah, what was the song called?  All right.  I'll just wait two seconds.  I think we're making changes.  No, it wasn't Axl F.  Hold on, hold on.  Same time about.  Man, we're making changes this week.  What happened? 
[00:29:00]  We need another guy in there.  I'm not even kidding.  Wow, are we pulling E-Rock?  We got to pull you, E-Rock.  I'm telling you.  E-Rock's getting pulled.  You're going into the basement to work on archives because you suck so bad.  Wow.  You know we're talking about Herbie Hancock today.  Why wouldn't you have that song ready to roll?  Because I have the other song.  Why would you need both songs?  You need the one we're going to obviously talk about.  The one that everyone knows.  And then you get the one that he won a Grammy for. 
[00:29:30]  Like that's like, that's college radio crap.  You realize you're in the big leagues, right?  Of course we're going to talk about the one hit he had back in the day.  So wouldn't you get that ready and ready to roll?  We should pimp him out.  Literally.  Literally pimp him out.  So people can have sex with him for money.  You got it now?  Oh, wow.  Great.  Right?  Yeah, this song.  Oh, oh. 
[00:30:00]  Remember this one?  In the video?  The little legs were swinging around.  Yeah, he just won for it.  25 years later, whatever the hell it is.  Well, yeah, this guy.  He won album of the year for something that doesn't sound anything like this.  People kind of like this.  There it is.  This is some cool crap.  I like this.  He doesn't think it's cool crap anymore.  No?  Because this is all he's known for.  And supposedly he's like a legit artist. 
[00:30:30]  Ah, go screw yourself.  You made this.  People liked it.  That's right.  Deal with it.  I like singing this at karaoke bars.  Do you just go...  Ask for instrumentals.  Well, all right.  Enough of that.  All right, so he won for this song or this album.  Do we know what the hit song was on this album?  Iraq, you can't hang about it.  What?  Get a mic there, Iraq. 
[00:31:00]  What?  What's the hit song, Iraq?  I don't think there was a hit song for it.  Well, I didn't hear it.  It's like an album of...  And I bet you're looking it up now to see if there was a hit song on this album, right?  All I have is a self-titled one, but I don't know.  Because you didn't think we would actually ask that question today on our show.  Oh, you are so moving into the basement.  Oh, no.  We need people that are willing to think.  But this is my cubicle.  I stay here.  Iraq, the question was... 
[00:31:30]  No, the basement, no, no.  Was there an actual single off this album?  And your answer was, I don't know.  But it's my stapler.  It's my stapler.  Moving to the basement.  What is this?  This is the song.  This is not the song.  What is it?  This is the self-titled song.  I'm not yelling at you.  I'm just yelling at the fact that this can't possibly be a song on the album, that one album of the year.  This is jazz, like.  I mean, this is a jazz record. 
[00:32:00]  It's great, but it...  It stinks.  I mean, if you like jazz, I don't like this.  It stinks.  I agree.  I was trying to be cultured.  Don't be cultured.  All right, you're right.  Well, you beat me out of that position pretty quickly.  He bitch slapped me out of that position.  With your own line.  With your hog.  I was sitting there talking.  He slapped my face with his hog.  And I'm like, you're right.  I'll sit over there.  Who is this?  Oh, this is the song.  River, the Joanie Letters.  Herbie Hancock.  This was album of the year. 
[00:32:30]  And it was a great year for music, too.  And they give it to some obscure song that 99.9% of the listening audience has no clue about.  Is this F music?  Hell yeah.  It's good, though.  I mean, I'm...  Yeah, it is good.  No, it's not.  You put this on when you want to get your freak on.  I couldn't listen to this.  I stopped my style, even to be very honest with you.  All right, I'm not.  Thank you.  I have a couple of things here I have to take a brief issue with. 
[00:33:00]  I like the fact that...  What's the difference between best album and best record?  We don't know.  What is the difference?  We really don't know.  We've been trying to figure that out for a long time.  We even asked that same question last year, and someone answered it, and I still don't  know.  And we don't know.  Yeah, we forgot.  I think one might be for the writer of the actual...  I don't know.  Of the song, and then the other is the actual song.  Help them.  Song of the Year, by the way, was Rehab by Amy Winehouse.  Best new artist, Amy Winehouse. 
[00:33:30]  He basically won everything.  Yes, Jimmy.  I was very...  I was...  I'm a little annoyed that...  Guys, as dumb as they come.  He's flustered now.  The icky thump by The White Stripes beat the remake of Working Class Heroes, which I just...  I've never heard that song by John Lennon until recently.  Oh, really?  I'm so...  I'm an older gentleman.  How have I not heard that?  It's all I want to hear lately.  And, uh... 
[00:34:00]  By the way, Icky Thump by The White Stripes is an amazing album.  Okay.  And it won Best Alternative Music Album of the Year.  This is the song?  Yeah.  You like The White Stripes?  Um, I don't listen to them, but they're good.  I pretty much have liked everything they have put out.  Almost every song in every album.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't, o, the thunk, sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah, when I jump in my head, got a bump when I hit it on the radio.  Redhead, cigarita, looking dead, kept the sweat, and need a bad, an Espanol.  Yeah, give me a drink of water, I'm gonna sing it on the car...  He was Zeppelin.  All right.  What else you got there, Jimmy?  E-Rock, my question, of course, I'm very sad that Ozzy did not win for I Don't Want to Stop.  The Pretender by the Foo Fighters, that song. 
[00:35:00]  Can I hear something?  That's the song that won.  Maybe it's good.  I don't know.  Mm-hmm.  He's sweating over there.  He's under the gun.  Hey, shaky fingers.  Stairway to heaven?  Exactly.  This is a good song, too.  Keep you in the dark, you know that you're pretty. 
[00:35:30]  Keep you in the dark, and so it all.  I hope this gets hard rocker.  I'm sure it'll kick in.  It's, you know.  I bring this up all the time, but who thought the drummer from Nirvana would be bigger than Nirvana? 
[00:36:00]  Sold more albums now, right?  Yeah.  Foo Fighters must have sold more albums than Nirvana at this point.  Must.  Yeah.  It can't even be close.  Yeah.  Is he saying his role thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  You're a talented bastard, that guy.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes, hey, Ope, if you like the White Stripes, you should pick  up the Raconteurs and Wolf Mother.  Yeah.  Way ahead of you there.  Thanks. 
[00:36:30]  Way ahead of you on that one.  That was good.  I can't say that.  I love Wolf Mother.  Bruce Springsteen.  You're like McCartney.  You should pick up wings.  Right.  All right.  Thanks.  Thanks for the tip.  Thanks for the tip.  I like to be turned on to new music, but that's an easy one.  Yeah.  Bruce Springsteen won a bunch of things.  Best Rock Song Radio Nowhere, which is a Songwriters Award.  Oh, he's mumbling more now than ever. 
[00:37:00]  He's trying to update his sound.  He's trying to do a Foo Fighters thing.  I like it. 
[00:37:30]  It's better than the other Bruce I've heard.  I don't like it.  No?  No.  Not bad.  Yeah, nice little.  That's a toe tapper.  Yeah.  I mean, it's all right.  I guess he ran out of Jersey songs.  Yeah, they're saying it's more than all right because it won for a bunch of things.  Best Rock Song, Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.  With the saxophone, we get it.  Yeah, that is annoying.  That just ruins it. 
[00:38:00]  Right there.  Ruins it.  Who enjoys the saxophone?  Clarence.  I was driving since I missed you.  All right.  I like that.  Oh, he was driving there.  I played all day.  Radio No.  Listen to 101.5.  In Jersey.  Wah, wah, wah.  It's a radio no more.  I'm driving down the coast.  Shut up. 
[00:38:30]  Well, you think he'll turn into a Jersey and Anthony.  Of course.  Going to the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.  Place hasn't been relevant in friggin' 20 years.  Yeah.  Best rap album.  Walking down the boardwalk.  There's nothing here anymore.  I'm irrelevant.  Well, there's something there.  Wah, wah, wah.  And then the only other highlight really last night was Kanye West. 
[00:39:00]  He went for Best Rap Album, Best Rap Solo Performance, Best Rap Performance.  I mean, it just goes on and on.  He had a big night.  Wasn't he in a big competition with Fitty about who was going to have the best album and most  albums sales?  Yeah.  I guess Fitty lost that one.  Big time.  Kanye's a bit cocky.  Yeah.  So this was his acceptance speech.  I think they all are.  Huh?  Rappers.  Yeah, rappers.  Oh, hey, hey.  Oh, cocky. 
[00:39:30]  Okay.  Okay.  This is him during his acceptance speech and then, I don't know, the music started,  you know, getting louder and he yelled and screamed to turn down the music.  It wasn't done yet.  And for once they said, whoa, okay.  I'm thinking a white dude does it.  You know, then they're cranking up the music.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, I need some time here.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun.  Get off the stage.  We'll be back with the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.  Sponsored by.  After these words.  But, you know, rap guy, you're going to turn down the music. 
[00:40:00]  Scared white guy at the controls is going to turn it back down for him.  Just let him talk.  It definitely feels good to be home, hear the Grammys.  You know, we snuck in about four years ago, four or five years ago.  And now we basically made this our new place of residence.  And is this the Obama acceptance speech?  In a state, you know, with the music game, they say, like, you know, you can't sell records.  So a lot of people say hip hop is dead. 
[00:40:30]  Not just Nas, but, you know, a lot of.  No one said that.  No, the people that sing it are dying.  Wait, hip hop isn't dead.  Who says hip hop is dead?  I know.  Hip hop is dead.  Are you kidding me?  Top ten songs every week.  Most of them are hip hop songs.  Top ten downloads are pretty much all hip hop songs.  They said hip hop would never come.  Who?  Who are these people?  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear that.  Who said that?  Some guy you overheard on Metro North? 
[00:41:00]  No one said hip hop was dead.  Hip hop's a fad.  Actually, there was one band that said that.  Kajagugu.  Oh, wow.  They're waiting there.  They're just waiting in the wings.  Yeah, they're waiting.  For that sound to come back.  For the big comeback.  Too shy shy.  Hush, hush.  People just said, like, the art form wasn't popping like that anymore.  You know, I wanted to cross the genres and show people, you know, how we could still express  ourselves with something fresh and new.  And that's what hip hop has always been about.  You know, coming out with new sounds and stuff.  So, always so common. 
[00:41:30]  Like, man, you got to time the album out better.  You can't drop them at the same year as me, man.  You got to.  This is my award.  He's really cocky.  He doesn't sound humble at all.  I'll wait till you hear what he says.  Right.  The second half here.  And for Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse.  Come on.  You're going to play music on me?  For Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse.  If I don't get to get up here for an album of the year, you deserve it just as much as me.  I deserve it, too. 
[00:42:00]  And just to say something about my mother, I appreciate all the support.  I appreciate all the prayers.  It would be in good taste to stop the music then.  I appreciate.  Oh, boy.  It would be in good taste and in your best interest to stop the music.  I appreciate everything.  And I know you're really proud of me right now.  And I know you wouldn't want me to stop. 
[00:42:30]  And you want me to be the number one artist in the world.  And, Mama, all I'm going to do is keep making you proud.  We run this.  You know what?  Erick just brought this up.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Kanye was crying at the VMAs because he didn't perform on the main stage and he wasn't winning.  He was calling it racist.  You know what?  I understand he was talking about his mom.  But how about you talk about her instead of saying how the Grammys is your new place of residence.  Or how about you instead of that crap about how someone said hip-hop was dead when no one said that. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, use that time to talk about your mom.  That was just manipulative.  Wait.  John's going to explain the whole hip-hop is dead thing.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Man, I just wanted to put it out there that Knox had that album last year or two years ago or whatever.  He said hip-hop's dead.  And he made some pretty good points on it.  Just pull that up.  Get E-Rock on that one.  Thanks.  We all look at E-Rock. 
[00:43:30]  No.  No.  No, I don't think that's going to happen.  Why don't we take a break?  Why don't we do that?  Okie doke.  Hey, still to come, of course, our honoree for Black History Month for today.  Oh, yes.  Just in case you miss Fridays, we've got to replay Fridays as we go to break here.  It's Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today. 
[00:44:00]  Today, we honor Norman Alexander Gibbs and Al White, best known as the Jive Dudes from the hit film Airplane.  Mack a self-approach, slick, a great amount of back, lot of farmers down, not take T.C. Ben, man.  Hey, you know what they say, see a broad to get that booty, yack'em.  Leg it down, smack em, yack'em.  Oh, got to be.  Yo.  Our sentiments exactly.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:44:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show, phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Talking about the Grammys a little bit before we move on.  A little bit more, I should say.  Tony Bennett.  Yeah.  Has officially lost it.  Tony Bennett.  It's official.  Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.  They're asking him questions.  Still sounds smooth.  Well, they're asking him questions.  Yeah, he sounds smooth, but he's not answering the questions.  Yeah.  He was on the red carpet, and they're asking him very simple questions, and he was giving 
[00:45:00]  answers to other questions in his head, I guess.  We got an example of that.  Listen very closely to the actual question.  And now, Tony Bennett is joining us.  Hi, Mr. Bennett.  Very nice to see you.  How are you?  I'm Susan.  Hi.  How are you, Susan?  Nice to see you.  How are you?  Wow, it's a hot one out tonight.  Yeah, it's warm.  Yeah, yeah.  I was just talking to Seal asking who we'd love to collaborate with.  You brought up your name.  Anyone you would love to collaborate with that's out on the scene right now that you're just 
[00:45:30]  a fan of?  Well, I'm looking forward to Beyonce and Tina Turner tonight dancing together right here.  That's a good one, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oops.  Why, um, why did he say that?  I don't know.  And then he kind of had this to say.  Yeah.  Do you sing to your wife?  How often do you sing to your wife?  What's that? 
[00:46:00]  How often do you sing to your wife?  Oh, she has some good taste, so I always do the best songs for her.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, well, thank you, Mr. Bennett.  It was nice to see you.  Thank you very much.  He was having a little problem, I guess.  Yeah, he was.  And then we move on.  This was very interesting.  George Lopez had a funny line at the Grammys last night.  But if you do it on a morning show on the radio, you would be fired before noon. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  It's just so stupid how this crap works.  It amazes me.  It'd be deemed racist.  This is what George Lopez had to say last night.  How great a country is this?  The only place where a white woman and a black man can run for the president of the United States.  That's right.  That's fine.  To ensure that nothing ever happens to either one of them, they should appoint a Mexican vice president. 
[00:47:00]  He's implying that an assassin would not go through with his plans because if there's a black man  or a white woman in office, America would rather have that than a Mexican.  Because they're hated more. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because Mexicans, for some reason, wouldn't make a good president.  And that's what he implied there with that statement.  How good would you be if you'd so totally and completely and utterly fired, literally, utterly, disgustedly fired?  They would get the Zeppelin record, run it in, push play and yank you out of your seat.  You can't sit here and imply that Mexicans are so incompetent that an assassin with his hatred of a black or female president would not go through with it 
[00:48:00]  because he would hate the fact, even more so than a woman or a black president, that a Mexican would be president.  We could say that, though.  What?  We wouldn't get in trouble for that.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  How?  All right.  Let it fly.  I think if they want to guarantee, if Hillary or Barack Obama, they want to get elected, they want to stop an assassin from doing anything, 
[00:48:30]  you get a Mexican vice president because that would frighten the assassin more.  Mm-hmm.  How is that going to get us in trouble?  Oh, Jimmy, they're taking him away.  He just fell through a trap door.  It's like, it was like an old, Eddie Murphy did a joke like that when Jesse Jackson was running.  Exactly.  About him just running back and forth doing his speech.  Yeah, yeah, doing his speeches, running back and forth.  And it's not even Lopez's joke, by the way.  It's coming in here.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, man, what's up?  Yeah, if you guys find, this was a bit like a few years back that Dave Chappelle did on, sorry, like verbatim, almost, like line for line. 
[00:49:00]  Really?  Called him Vice President Santiago.  Yeah.  Wow.  Can we find the Chappelle joke?  That would be nice.  I don't, I'm sure that Chappelle didn't steal it, but I don't think Lopez is a thief.  That might have been one that Lopez was doing for years, too.  Yeah.  Are you sticking up for George Lopez?  I like Lopez a lot, yeah.  All right.  And then CNN had a nice moment that they decided to blow off yesterday.  They were doing their own red carpet coverage. 
[00:49:30]  And who was it that walked on the red carpet with, who was it?  Who was it?  A shirt with the N-word on it.  Naz?  Naz.  Naz.  Naz.  Naz.  Naz.  Naz.  Naz had a N-word shirt.  Yeah, with the full word.  Full, and it wasn't, you know.  And it wasn't ending in A. It was the word.  No, it was the big one.  The N-bomb.  Do you think a white artist would have been allowed into the Grammys with that on?  Are you kidding me? 
[00:50:00]  Are you out of your mind?  Look at that thing.  And they zoom in above it.  Well, they must have been like, oh my God, get the camera off of it.  Get it, oh my God, you can see the word.  No, they're zooming out.  They're making sure the N-word shirt is being seen on CNN, because they understand how outrageous  that is.  No, they threw up a graphic.  They keep zooming in.  A graphic.  And they all have the N-word shirts on, the three women he was with.  Why?  And the CNN reporter just not even acknowledging what she's seeing. 
[00:50:30]  Why would she?  Why would she?  Not even acknowledging that a guy is wearing the N-word shirt to the Grammys.  It's just another case of just the phony cowards in the media.  Like, why wouldn't you address that?  Just say, I'm noticing your shirt.  Isn't that offensive?  We've reported a lot of stories where that word has been found offensive and shouldn't  be used, yet you are wearing a shirt with that word on it.  How great.  Yo, I can say whatever I want, because I'm Nas, mother...  Would it be great if she said, I love your... 
[00:51:00]  Please tell me where I can get that shirt.  Where can I get that shirt?  My kids would love that.  I'd love that.  And do you have a hat and scarf to go with it?  That shirt, I have to have it.  Wow.  He is just...  He's very proud of that shirt.  He's sporting the shirt nicely there.  But I don't...  I think it's cool.  He should be able to work and call his album that.  You're right.  It's just amazing.  The white reporter, too scared to even acknowledge that she's seeing that.  Oh, she did say something? 
[00:51:30]  To him?  About the shirt?  Oh, God bless her then.  We're wrong today.  What else?  Can we ever listen to something before we talk about it?  No, we just comment on it like we know what we're talking about.  That's our job.  I apologize.  Whether we do or not.  I don't.  I am appalled.  I am disgusted.  Literally.  Disgustedly appalled.  Disgustedly.  I am dreadful.  Dreadful.  All right.  Well, we're waiting for that audio to come in.  Wow.  Don't buy him.  Yeah.  In other news, Roger Clemens' wife is on the roids, huh? 
[00:52:00]  Or the human growth hormone.  Allegedly.  Allegedly, yeah.  That came out over the weekend.  This is Brian McNamee.  My God.  I'm sure he hangs out with Keith Olbermann.  Some reports coming in that she may have used some growth hormones, whatever the hell they  call them, steroids, before she did a magazine shoot.  Yeah.  For Sports Illustrated.  Sports Illustrated.  They had a big spread where they had wives of famous athletes.  Looking to get a little definition maybe. 
[00:52:30]  Trimmed down.  Bulk up a little.  Why not?  And if her husband was doing them, you would think he'd go, hey, you want to, you know,  I'll jab you one and you'll look good for your magazine shoot.  It's possible.  I don't know.  I think Roger Clemens did do it, personally.  Just looking at the evidence and the kind of guy he is.  I would say yes.  The kind of guy he is.  The kind of guy he is.  What kind of guy is he?  The kind of guy that, like, you know, picks up bat pieces and throws them at people. 
[00:53:00]  Broken bat pieces.  Yeah.  He just seemed to have a little rage in him.  I don't know.  Hey, let's say hi to Chris in the Bronx.  Chris.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Actually, the shirt that he's wearing, that's actually going to be the name of his album.  Yeah, which, again, is ridiculous.  Hey, God bless him.  I was hoping someone was going to do this.  There's a lot of attention for that word right now.  Put out an album that's named after that.  You're going to get a lot of exposure. 
[00:53:30]  My only thing is this, though.  Do you know what label's putting it out?  Because, again, I would love to.  What label's putting it out?  And, like, stores are going to sell it, but are they going to wrap it up?  Like, again, would they?  Yeah, you can't just display that all over the place.  My God, people would go crazy.  It's more like he's an artist that, you know, he's a different kind of artist, so he's kind  of doing it more for the art, not for, like, album sales and things like that.  Not for shock value?  Yeah, no, that's definitely going to attract attention, but I just wanted to call and let 
[00:54:00]  you guys know.  Hey, thank you, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Are you black?  No, no, I'm actually Boricua.  Boricua.  What is that?  That's like, um...  What?  You're Puerto Rican.  Yeah, I'm Puerto Rican, 100%.  So why can't you...  You can't say Puerto Rican anymore?  No, we just say Boricua because it's more of a culture thing, you understand?  Well, now we do.  Boricua is more of a, you know, an American thing, but, you know, I still accept it. 
[00:54:30]  Okay, cool.  Hey, is Nas actually a good...  Thanks, sir.  Is he a good rapper?  No, yeah, he's one of...  He's actually...  He's actually one of the best, and the longevity in this kind of business, in the hip-hop business,  he's been around for a long time, just like LL Cool J.  Okay.  And he also came out with Hip Hop Is Dead.  Hip Hop Is Dead.  LL Cool J.  I like the way he said that.  He announced the album's title after a performance on May 18th, 2006, in a late September interview  on English DJ Tim Westwood's radio show.  He said, Hip Hop Is Dead because we, as artists, no longer have the power. 
[00:55:00]  He went on to say, Basically, America Is Dead.  There's no political voice.  Music Is Dead.  Our way of thinking is dead.  Our commerce is dead.  Everything in this society has been done.  That's where we are as a country.  And your fire hits dying.  Love Indiana Jones.  And then album sales, you know?  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We got the audio from him walking the red carpet with the N-word shirt.  This is how it went down.  This is Nas.  He's got his back turned.  He doesn't know we're on air.  We're live right now. 
[00:55:30]  How you doing?  How you doing?  Making a statement here with your t-shirt.  This is the name of your upcoming album.  Yeah.  What kind of response have you gotten on the carpet with this?  The carpet?  I haven't really been paying attention, but so far, like with all you guys, it's just  been open-mindedness.  And I appreciate that.  What kind of message are you hoping to send with that new album and with the title?  It's all the experiences we go through every day of all ethnicities.  Black, white, and different.  Stop it.  I got my friends here, the actress, Danya.  I got all my crew here. 
[00:56:00]  We've all at some point felt discriminated on, you know, whether it's in Dominican Republic,  whether it's in China, whether it's in Iraq, with soldiers getting their heads blown  off for reasons we don't know why.  And, you know, the meaning of the word is supposed to be ignorant.  So there's money being made off us poor, innocent, so-called ignorant people.  So no longer are just black people today.  It's also me and you.  They bleeped the word out, though.  Isn't that weird?  They show it.  But then they bleep it out when he said it. 
[00:56:30]  Or did we bleep it?  Or did we bleep it?  Oh, my God.  We got to bleep it.  Something off CNN.  Wait, who said to bleep it?  We've been told to bleep it every time.  Yeah.  That was a news story.  That's a story.  That's lies, man.  That's off CNN.  That's CNN.  I mean, what are they going to get us in trouble to say we were playing CNN audio?  We don't have to bleep that ass.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  There you have it.  That's the explanation to that thing.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  I had a fun little experience over the weekend. 
[00:57:00]  What happened?  You know, you people are calling me crazy and stuff, and I understand.  But my girlfriend gets out of the shower and walks in the bedroom, and she goes, okay, now I'm scared.  See, I was laying in bed, and I had been to the range a few times and decided I needed to clean my rifle.  So I was cleaning my rifle in bed as I was just kind of propped up on the pillows and cleaning. 
[00:57:30]  And even she now is going, okay, now I'm getting scared.  Especially when you start asking her questions as you're cleaning.  So where were you yesterday?  I just thought it was kind of funny that she is getting a little frightened.  That's a weird visual, man.  Yeah.  Were you naked?  I had shorts on, but, you know, I was topless. 
[00:58:00]  And I'm just watching, and the line of fire was on.  And then I'm just kind of cleaning out things.  Yeah.  It was fun.  Why in bed?  I was in bed.  I was in bed.  And why get up?  And I had all the stuff right there.  And I'm like, you know, it needs a cleaning.  So I just, I'll take it apart.  I understand, like.  Field stripping in bed.  I understand cleaning up your iPod or something. 
[00:58:30]  You know, getting rid of songs that you don't care about.  Stuff like that.  But cleaning a gun in bed.  You got to kind of, you know, keep your weapons clean.  Yeah.  Ready to rock.  There you go, Charlene.  So your action is beautiful.  Anthony talks to his rifle.  Yes.  Yes.  I talk to him.  Oh, no.  Is there an animation of me?  Shooting a computer.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Let's go to Malik in Jersey.  That's the latest animation that you can download. 
[00:59:00]  What?  iTunes?  Yeah.  If you go to iTunes, you go to the podcast section.  We got free animated downloads that have something to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  Basically, Coke Logic is animating our bits.  And you can download them for free through iTunes in the podcast section.  Very cool.  Yes.  Hey, Malik.  What's up?  Yo, what's good?  What's up, Norton?  Hey, Malik.  Yeah.  The whole thing with Nas and using that word and everything is that the whole thing that  he came up with the whole concept of hip-hop is dead is because what he's trying to say 
[00:59:30]  is that the culture of hip-hop, you know what I'm saying, the DJ, the breakdance, and  the graffiti, the whole element of hip-hop is dead.  So he was like, being that the art of hip-hop is dead, he's going to start coming out with  albums that their names are controversial to raise people's awareness of the art of hip-hop.  So that's why you come out with albums like hip-hop is dead, the N-word, you know what  I'm saying, blah, blah, blah.  See, I have no problem with him doing that.  It's like, good for him.  He's an artist.  He can do what he wants. 
[01:00:00]  It's only the reaction is so selective from certain people.  That's all it is.  I got no problem with him doing it.  Good for him.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, definitely.  Jimmy, you're 100% right.  Oh, and by the way, Jim Norton, I want to say big up to all Trini and Jamaica, massive,  you know what I'm saying?  Oh, thank you.  I don't know what he said.  I just answered in Jamaican.  We just talked.  All right, good.  Thank you.  Let's go to Syracuse.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, Brian.  Let's go, Brian.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  I'm calling shenanigans out of Anthony, man.  Man, what do you do?  Lay down plastic on your bed, man? 
[01:00:30]  You know how damn dirty it is to clean a gun.  You're especially going to break it down and get all them solvents out and get it all over  your $4,000 sheets.  What are you, crazy, man?  I had a towel over my lap, and I did it on the towel, and my hands got a little dirty, but  the bed didn't get a little dirty.  I know how to clean a weapon.  All right, he's gone.  It was a little frightening.  Hey, we found the Chappelle joke, so this is what Lopez said last night. 
[01:01:00]  Hold on one second here.  How great a country is this?  The only place where a white woman and a black man can run for the president of the United  States.  That's right.  To ensure that nothing ever happens to either one of them, they should appoint a Mexican  vice president.  Anything bad happens? 
[01:01:30]  Vice President Flacco.  We'd leave it at the White House, but with blue trim here.  And this is Chappelle.  I don't want to be president because I'm black.  That doesn't make it too hot for me.  I mean, you know what I mean?  I think there could be a black president one day, but you don't want to be the first one.  I mean, second or third, that's fine, but that first nigga better watch out.  I'm going to tell you that right now.  I'm too hot.  I mean, I'd be the first black president.  I don't think that nobody would really, really hurt me. 
[01:02:00]  I'm sure somebody would want to hurt me, but I don't think they'd touch me because my  vice president will be Mexican for a little insurance.  You know what I'm saying?  You can shoot me if you want, but you're just going to open the border up, so you might  as well leave me and Vice President Santiago to our own devices.  Ain't that right, Santiago?  C.  C. 
[01:02:30]  Wow.  Funny dude, man.  Yes, that was.  Chappelle has great timing.  It was so much better when Chappelle just told that joke than the Lopez version.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm only saying I don't think Lopez stole it.  I don't think that's Lopez's forte.  No?  No.  No, no.  Well, that was pretty similar, though.  Exactly, but again, I'm only going to say Lopez might have been doing that for 15 years.  Yeah.  I don't think Chappelle would take it.  So you called Chappelle a thief?  No.  Not at all.  No.  No, Dave has very good integrity. 
[01:03:00]  You're a diplomat.  I like you.  But if I thought one of them was stealing, I would say it.  Well, no, it's weird, though.  Our listeners knew that it was a Chappelle joke, so don't you think George Lopez would  have known it was a Chappelle joke?  I didn't know.  I didn't know that Chappelle did it before he did.  Ah.  Before he did.  It's a little weird.  Don't forget, I'm a comic, too.  I never heard it.  A lot of times, comics don't listen to each other, man.  Sometimes we do.  Right.  And other times, you really don't, because you don't like-  You don't want to.  Yeah, he might have, but-  All I'm saying is, if it was one guy and it's a feedback, I'd understand, but as soon  as we played that Lopez joke, people were like, bam, that's Chappelle's joke. 
[01:03:30]  They may know more about other comics jokes than a lot of working comics jokes.  That's interesting.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Cool.  We got Bill Burr standing by.  He's joining the program tonight.  All right.  He's doing Letterman tonight?  He's doing Letterman tonight.  That's very, very nice.  I like Bill.  I want to hear his take.  Coming in from Hollywood to do Letterman.  I'm sure there's some conspiracy involved with the election.  Election.  Dode.  Dode.  Bill likes to sit back.  Dode.  And then he has always these weird theories, but they somehow make some kind of sense.  Of course they do.  He talks me into a lot of these conspiracy things where after he leaves, I'm like, jeez, 
[01:04:00]  I think Bill had a point there.  I got to look into this a little bit further.  There's gas in our urine.  He's absolutely right.  We could fuel our cars with it.  Yeah.  And he's a Pats fan, so we'll get his take on the Super Bowl a little bit.  Well, maybe not.  We'll see how he's doing with that whole thing.  We're going to slice his Achilles before he walks in.  Yeah, I know.  Let him hobble in.  I know.  Let's go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have seven new voice messages. 
[01:04:30]  First voice message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big f***ing cue to my f***ing boss.  Thanks for only giving me a 50-cent raise after a year and a half, you f***er.  I hope you go bankrupt.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big f***ing cue to a guy I work with.  Alan, you're a f***er.  Everybody knows it.  You're ugly.  You smell funny.

[01:05:00]  Hey, Timmy, f*** you.  Next message.  Hey, it's Rob and Augusta.  I want to leave a big f***ing cue to Sandy, the girl that I picked up at the bar.  Hung out with her for a couple of weeks.  She liked s***.  Gave me great s***.  And then just blows me off.  What's up with that?  F*** you, Sandy.  Next message.  Hey, this is Mike in Stockton.  And I want to give a big f***ing cue to all the hookers on Craigslist to try to pull the bait and switch.  I'm not going to f*** you if you don't look like you do in your picture. 
[01:05:30]  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big f***ing cue to my neighbor who keeps calling the police and having my car towed.

Get the f*** out of the house and get super aged, you bitch.  Next message.  Yeah, I gotta say f*** you to Jack Daniels, you son of a bitch. 
[01:06:00]  I punched my mother.  End of new messages.  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Bill Burr joining the program.  It's going to be on Letterman tonight.  Let's not forget about that.  Ooh.  It's going to be on Friday.  Oh, your tape today?  Yeah, it tapes to...  Oh, they do that tape thing.  Yeah, I'm on the late one. 
[01:06:30]  I'm glad you jumped right in there then, Bill.  Okay, so Friday we'll see you on Letterman.  Absolutely.  Great tapes today.  Great.  Roy Scheider.  Dead.  Dead.  75.  I guess God needed a shark hunter.  What did God need in this case?  Not him.  He's just an old guy with a few diseases.  So he's dead.  Jimmy very pissed off and I don't blame him.  Got to bring it to the show, Jimmy.  This behind-the-scenes stuff is driving us nuts.  I didn't realize this, but the guys are actually looking for it now, but Keith Olbermann, who 
[01:07:00]  I just can't tell you how much I hate this smug boar, who crucified his own co-worker for  saying that Chelsea was pimped out, apparently on page 7 of the Post.  Jimmy, can I slow you down a little bit?  Because people are just waking up.  I want to replay that.  Yeah.  Who was it?  David Schuster?  Yes.  On MSNBC, I said that Chelsea Clinton is being pimped out, yes, for the Hillary campaign.  And he had to apologize, and that wasn't good enough. 
[01:07:30]  For some reason, Keith Olbermann is now apologizing for his co-worker in such a smug way.  This is how it went down.  Now you have probably heard that on this network yesterday, my colleague David Schuster,  discussing Chelsea Clinton's role, a first for her in her mother's campaign, asked a  guest, quote, doesn't it seem like Chelsea's sort of being pimped out in some weird sort  of way?  Now, the greatest possible respect for David Schuster's work, his reporting for this show  and others, is assiduous and excellent, and his political insight is keen.  All that being noted, it was still an utterly inappropriate and indefensible thing to say. 
[01:08:00]  The Clintons have every right to be furious, hurt, and appalled.  Many of us here have similar reactions, ones that transcend political parties and politics  itself.  David has been suspended.  It remains only for me to apologize without limit to President Clinton, to Senator Clinton,  and to Ms. Clinton, on behalf of MSNBC.  We are literally, dreadfully sorry.  And this is the reason why we hate, or most of us in this studio, hate Keith Olbermann. 
[01:08:30]  Go, Jimmy.  Trying so hard to be eloquent.  Using big words.  Trying so hard.  Oh, I get it.  You're smarter than me.  Trying so hard to be the eloquent spokesman who sets it right.  And this is why I just, I hate his parted hair, first of all.  He looks like John Edwards, but slightly more irritated, because he apparently said the  same thing about a general.  And this is what he said.  There's a date here and everything.  September 20, 2007.  Apparently, he said, in pimping General David Petrius, or whatever, in a violation of everything 
[01:09:00]  in this country, blah, blah, blah.  So he used the expression, so he understands that it's like a pop culture way of speaking.  It's not literally, you mean pimping her out, putting makeup on her, send her out the door  to have sex for money, and then bring it back to the Clintons.  So he knows, it's almost like the Giants are going to kill the Patriots.  Like, now that's, I'm not saying that to rub your face in the bill, but I'm only saying  that's like, nobody thinks the Giants are going to murder the Patriots.  It's just kind of like the pop culture way we speak. 
[01:09:30]  Yes.  It's our language, our common language understanding.  So when you say pimp out, it just means using somebody for your own gains.  Yeah.  And that's pretty much what he was insinuating that the Clintons are doing with Chelsea.  So I was wondering, we should have kind of, hopefully we would have had that because it's...  Well, it was buried in the paper today, Jimmy.  Why would we have that?  And, and...  That would be a tough find.  Even though she was brought up in front of us in the White House as a little kid, she's  not a little girl anymore.  Right. 
[01:10:00]  She can handle herself.  She can handle it.  Yeah, it's not like you're saying this about, uh...  She's old enough to be pimped.  To be pimped out.  And hot enough.  It's...  I'd give her 150, 200.  She gets points.  She gets points just for being the Clintons' daughter.  Yeah.  Like, like that right there, even if you don't find her attractive, the thought of having  any kind of contact like that with her would be a little more titillating because of the  power base of her parents. 
[01:10:30]  And, and again, this is, uh, not to...  Because I actually do like her.  I like the fact that she stayed...  But why is she untouchable?  She's now...  Off limits.  Yeah.  Like, she's now speaking up in the campaign and she is an adult and it's like, look...  Now she's fair game.  If she is, is, uh, stumping for her mom, she is then fair game for any criticism.  And if somebody wants to say she's being pimped out by her mother and father to go out there  and, and phone, do phoners to these superdelegates to try to get them on board, uh, then you can 
[01:11:00]  absolutely say that the Clintons are, figuratively speaking, pimping her out.  But again, that's not pointed out.  And this, this smarmy, smarmy hypocrite the guy is.  He just, uh...  I have to go look up assiduous.  I don't do...  Assiduous.  I really want to use that today.  Assiduous.  He just wanted to show that he's smarter than you.  With assiduous.  He's so smug every night on that dump show.  All I know is whenever you say the word, you have to pronounce every letter.  Assiduous.  I thought it was residuous. 
[01:11:30]  I don't see.  I don't even...  I said that so clearly I could spell it from the way he said it.  Uh, Clint Day from Dallas writes, dreadfully sorry should be reserved for squashing infants  with tires.  Yeah, he apologized like something really horrible was done.  And it's like, eh, come on.  Uh, what did he do?  I remember a few years ago somebody said, uh, they were talking about a game coming up  and one of the athletes said, yeah, this is going to be a war.  And then he had to apologize because we were at war.  Or don't you think during a time like this, it's like, oh, shut up. 
[01:12:00]  We spend more time in this country apologizing for crap that, first of all, you don't need  to apologize for.  And secondly, the people that are apologizing really don't mean it.  No one really gets on and does a public apology and means it.  I'm sorry.  It just doesn't happen.  I've apologized numerous times.  I've never meant it.  I've never meant it in public.  You know, when people say, do you apologize for this, that or the other thing?  I'm just going to be honest.  No, I've thought I was right every single goddamn time. 
[01:12:30]  And I was forced to make an apology.  I don't, I don't apologize.  Yeah.  We do our thing and, you know, hope for the best, you know, at home, it's different.  Apologizing.  Even if you don't mean it, you got to say you did dreadfully.  Sorry.  I'm dreadfully, literally, dreadfully sorry.  Whatever.  Whatever.  What else is going on in the world today?  We got this how to look your best naked crap from a gay guy, by the way. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, by the way, if we ever do have to apologize in the future, I just want to tell the listeners,  I don't mean it.  All right.  If we ever have to, and it looks like I'm being sincere and really apologetic, I'm not,  and I never mean it.  Like they really believed us last time.  Oh, please, stop.  Assiduous, by the way.  Worst acting ever.  Sharp, caustic, his assiduous criticism of the book.  Oh.  Was keen.  Thank you, Sam.  Is that the audio?  Keen.  Oh, wait. 
[01:13:30]  Whoa, whoa, wait.  Really?  This is a good find.  Okay, so let's play the Oberman thing again.  Oh, God, do we hate this guy?  This is Oberman apologizing about his colleague.  And now you have probably heard that on this network yesterday, my colleague David Schuster discussing  Chelsea Clinton's role, a first for her in her mother's campaign, asked a guest, quote,  doesn't it seem like Chelsea's sort of being pimped out in some weird sort of way?  And the greatest possible respect for David Schuster's work, his reporting for this show 
[01:14:00]  and others, is assiduous and excellent, and his political insight is keen.  All that being noted, it's so an utterly inappropriate and indefensible thing to say.  The Clintons have every right to be furious, hurt, and appalled.  Many of us here have similar reactions, ones that transcend political parties and politics  itself.  Liar.  If it has been suspended, it remains only for me to apologize without limit to President  Clinton, to Senator Clinton, and to Ms. Clinton on behalf of MSNBC.  We are literally, dreadfully sorry.  And remember, Chelsea's an adult. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Because he's about to use the same term.  We're pimping.  It's amazing.  She is an adult, and everyone knew the context in which it was used.  God almighty, why are you so groveling?  My favorite part of that is how he apologizes without limit, which means if Hillary said,  come over and be my maid for a month, he would say yes.  He would have to.  Because there's no limit to his apology.  Because he's that dreadfully sorry.  Dreadfully. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  Well, this is Keith Overman.  Phony!  This is Keith Overman going back in time just a year or two.  What year was it again, Jerry?  DeLorean.  Oh, just a few months ago.  Yeah.  Okay, this is Overman, who did that apology for his colleague there.  Mr. Bush, you have hidden behind the general's skirts.  And today you've hidden behind the skirts of the planted last question at a news conference  to indicate once again that your presidency has been about the tilted playing field,  about no rules for your party in terms of character assassination and changing the fabric 
[01:15:30]  of our nation, and no right for your opponents or critics to as much as respond.  That, sir, is not only un-American, it is dictatorial.  And in pimping General David Petraeus, sir, in violation of everything this country has been  assiduously and vigilantly against for 2020.  He loves it.  He's trying to blur the gleaming radioactive demarcation between the military and the political.  Looks like someone got one of those calendars. 
[01:16:00]  Word of the day.  Big word of the day.  Today's big word of the day.  It's assiduous.  What a dope.  What a funny.  Wow.  Pimping.  And he said it like pimping.  Oh, that is a great word.  That just makes you bristle.  Yeah.  Somebody uses that word.  He uses it all the time.  Assiduously.  Assiduous.  Honey, this steak is assiduous.  Just uses it wrong.  Right.  As long as he's using it.  Right.  Don't stop.  I'm getting close.  But it tastes assiduous.  Assiduous. 
[01:16:30]  And you're right.  The Fox is the only network that's biased politically.  Not at this.  No.  No.  Only Fox.  I think they're really balanced.  Yeah.  I find.  There you go.  There's the hypocrite right there.  He used the same example.  He used it.  Pimping.  He used it worse.  In a worse way.  Now, I don't think he meant that President Bush was putting this guy out on the street,  having him have sex, and then collecting the money.  I don't think that's what he meant. 
[01:17:00]  Even though he is a douche, I don't think that's what he meant.  Wait a minute.  I get it.  Hmm.  What?  In criticizing Bush, he was criticizing a conservative.  But, when you're criticizing Chelsea Clinton, you're criticizing.  Aha.  Oh, right.  See?  It's a different party.  The Democrats.  Okay.  Now I get it.  Okay.  That makes sense.  Both adults.  The general's an adult.  Chelsea's an adult.  Both making their own free choice.  The general joined the military.  Chelsea is speaking freely.  No one touched Chelsea for years. 
[01:17:30]  And when her mother was campaigning for a senator, she didn't get up and give speeches.  She didn't talk because pretty much her mother had it in the bag.  You knew she was going to win.  Now this one's getting real close.  So she's dragging out every possible thing she can.  One of which is the daughter that is well-liked in this country.  So if she gets up there and speaks on her behalf, why can't somebody criticize that by saying that she is figuratively speaking, of course, being pimped out by her parents? 
[01:18:00]  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong with that?  It was a direct – literally, he said Bush was pimping this guy, and you aren't the Clintons pimping her.  It was a direct parody.  Yeah, of course.  A parallel.  And one is okay.  And one's not.  And one gets you suspended.  And puts out an apology that should be reserved for accidentally killing a family.  It's just – it is no place for that apology. 
[01:18:30]  Let's go to John in New York.  John.  Hey, John.  I wonder if there's a world record for the most syllables in a sentence.  There's a lot of big words in that sentence.  He used big words.  He sure did.  All right.  Thanks.  Cigars and Scotch.  What's up?  His monotonous use of the word assiduous is dreadful, and I suggest you break out the  thesaurus and start apologizing on his behalf.  With a thesaurus?  Big thesaurus apology. 
[01:19:00]  It was a writer's strike.  So he had just –  Yeah.  I'll turn this into an apology.  Assiduous.  He loves that word, though.  Oh, boy.  Hold on, man.  We got a supporter, I think.  Dennis in New York.  Yes.  Yes.  Good morning, fellows.  Yes.  I would like to say this unabashed reviling of Keith Olbermann is both capricious and arbitrary.  We have a smart listener.  Wow.  Thank you, man.  I'm glad you agree. 
[01:19:30]  I'd like to linger momentarily.  Oh, that is very funny.  Thank you, sir.  Frunkus, fellows.  Frunkus, indeed, Frunkus.  Let's go to Joe in Denver.  Joe?  Hey, good morning, but what the hell does assiduous mean?  Assiduous.  It means sharp and caustic.  And here's an example.  His assiduous criticism of the book.  Yes.  Of the book.  He criticized it in his sharp and caustic fashion.  Sharp and caustic. 
[01:20:00]  That book sucked.  That is assiduous.  What did you think of that book?  It was shite.  Jimmy?  Yes.  Do you think Keith Olbermann likes using the word assiduous?  I don't think he likes that word.  I think he loves it.  Ah, the catchphrase.  There was a bullet wound, and there was assiduous around it, Sam. 
[01:20:30]  How could there be assiduous around it?  Sharp and caustic?  Yes.  That's right.  I think the knife was assiduous.  It was cut with an assiduous blade.  Oh, what did that result in?  Murder.  You almost forgot.  You almost forgot his catchphrase.  I know.  That's his big Jim C. catchphrase.  You almost forgot your catchphrase.  It's one of my favorite impressions he does.  I do.  Quincy.  I know three lines from it. 
[01:21:00]  He only does three lines, but they're fantastic.  And he was dreadfully sorry.  He was assiduous.  Let's get Anthony in New York.  Anthony.  Great club menu bastard.  Good morning, guys.  Thanks.  I was just wondering.  I haven't heard from Tyson in a while.  I wonder if he knows how to spell assiduous.  Assiduous.  Y-Q-R-P-L pound sign and an exclamation point.  Assiduous. 
[01:21:30]  Assiduous.  I got into her assiduous, and she charged me with rape.  Wow, there's a linger-longer.  You think the pimping reference was incorrect, Mike?  No, that was legitimate.  Legit.  L-B-Q-R-A.  Legitimate.  I have been getting...  A lot of people are being assiduous with me.  What does that mean?  That means I get charged with rape again. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, I should use the more one.  The queen of England is an assiduous hole.  Well, let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Holy crap, Ant.  Thank you.  I thought assiduous was a kind of tree.  Oh, okay. 
[01:22:30]  Well, whatever.  The password is assiduous.  What?  I'll take assiduous for a thousand, Alex.  What my stroke was.  Assiduous.  No, that would be under hilarious for a thousand.  We change gears with this.  Turn the handles, hear them click.  You'll never know when you'll be hit.  It's Pie Face. 
[01:23:00]  Ask your mom for some cream.  Pilot high in the scream.  Now you spin, watch the snore.  Never had such fun before.  It's Pie Face.  Something else you can do.  Play the game without the goo.  It's Pie Face.  Pie Face, the goofiest, funniest suspense game.  Just reset the mystery handle, load the sponge with water,  or ask mom or dad to put on topping or foam.  The spinner tells you the turns to take.  But watch out, it's Pie Face. 
[01:23:30]  It's a game and it's new.  Get your face full of goo.  It's Pie Face.  With spinner, mask, and pie thrower.  Fun for you and grown-ups too.  Pie Face from Hasbro.  Is that real?  Is that a game?  I don't even remember that one.  And I remember everything.  1968.  That kind of flopped.  Okay.  Yeah.  I guess they thought, wow, it's funny.  Kids just love watching those pie-throwing things.  Look at the video. 
[01:24:00]  We'll put it up on onaradio.com.  Oh, is that it?  You put your face in, like, a little hole in a piece of cardboard.  Yeah.  And then you crank what amounts to a hand holding a pie.  Self-inflicted Pie Face.  And it slams it into your face.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  That's nice.  Oh, you spin something and then, what?  I think it tells you how many times you have to turn your thing.  Yeah.  Oh, so the more you've got to turn it, the more chances you're going to get pie-faced.  You're going to get goo in your face.  Oh, that's great. 
[01:24:30]  That's right.  That's what parents want, huh?  Yeah, way to teach kids how to get goo in their face.  What a mess that would make.  You do it with a nice hot shepherd's pie or a pot pie.  Right.  Pot pie face.  Scald your child in the face.  Remove those zits.  I can't think of a rhyme.  It's Pie Face on YouTube, and we'll link it later.  Hey, Frank in Brooklyn, what's up?  Hey, it's Fred from Brooklyn.  Oh, Fred, what's up?  Whatever.  Of course it is.  I don't care about your name.  We know that.  How you doing?  Good.  You guys are ragging on Keith Olbermann unnecessarily. 
[01:25:00]  I personally think he's supercalifragilisticexpialidus.  Wow.  Big words.  Yes, you've got to use it.  Yeah, if you're calling this show today, you've got to use big words, please.  We want to up our game a little bit.  Keith is supercalifragilisticexpialiduscious.  Douchous.  Yes.  Clutch Baltimore.  Boo.  Wow.  Do you know my scalp is tingling? 
[01:25:30]  I kind of liked it, Jimmy.  How far into the word did you get that you realized the end was just not going to really?  Super.  What killed him?  It was a bomb.  A bomb went off and it blew his mouth out.  Get my member's holy jacket and my flat-ass girlfriend.  You don't have to put the music on every goddamn time.  On my way, we get it.  Let's go to Baltimore. 
[01:26:00]  Clutch, what's up?  Hey, I just want to mention that he was actually pimped out by his network for using that apology.  Yeah, that apology was.  Yeah, he was pimped out by MSNBC.  See you, boys.  Very good.  How ironic.  Good observation.  What irony.  We got Bill Burr in the studio.  He's going to be on Letterman on Friday.  Tonight.  No, he's taping.  Taped tonight.  Oh.  And they showed on Friday.  Were you out of the studio?  Oh, you were out of the studio.  I was out of the studio.  I didn't realize.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we did.  And also.  I want to know what Bill's working on.  Like, in his head.  I want to know what you're working on as far as conspiracies. 
[01:26:30]  After the break.  Any kind of problems that you have.  The whole election thing.  I want to tell you what your take is on that.  We have a nice cumia argument.  Yeah.  After the break.  But it's Black History Month.  We have today's honoree.  Yes.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes,  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor outspoken, loving mother and panel host on The View, Sherry Shepard. 
[01:27:00]  Is the world flat?  Yes.  I don't know.  What do you think?  I never thought about it, Whoopi.  Is the world flat?  I never thought about it.  You never thought about whether the world was right?  No, because I'll tell you what I thought about.  How I'm going to feed my child.  Well, you can do both.  How I'm going to take care of my family.  The world.  Is the world flat?  Has never entered into.  That has not been an important thing to me.  Sherry Shepard, your words never fall flat on our ears.  I don't think anything predated Christians. 
[01:27:30]  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Phil Byrne Studio.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  Still a lot to do today.  We got men hiring proposal planners for Valentine's Day.  Huh?  Proposal planners now they got?  Yeah.  Instead of just wedding planners and everything?  Yeah.  Planner for everything. 
[01:28:00]  We could go down that road.  And then Anthony brought this to our attention.  How to look your best naked.  Yeah.  It's in the paper today.  How to look your best naked.  And it's a little list.  Top ten, I guess.  A list of what you could do to make yourself look and feel better about your nude body.  Sit-ups.  Yeah.  Well, that's what they should do.  Exactly.  Exercise.  Exactly.  Genetics.  Genetics.  But no, this is just a fluff piece written by, what's his name, Queer Eye Guy, Carson. 
[01:28:30]  Well, this is the problem.  Everyone has insecurities.  Let me read the first paragraph about how they look in the buff.  Thankfully, we now have Queer Eye for the Straight Guys, Carson Cressley, to make us feel good about our bodies.  Here's the problem.  He's making women feel good about their naked bodies.  Have you seen the show?  He doesn't know.  I refuse to.  Oh, it's brutal.  Maybe we should get audio from it.  He doesn't know. 
[01:29:00]  He'll have some really hefty girl.  Thank you.  And he'll put her in bigger panties than she was wearing and then say you look great.  And then he just picks up this fat mess and sort of bounces her around like she's a big baby.  And she's going, I feel great.  And it's one of the most horrific things you've ever seen.  I was watching with my girl and she was punching me in the shoulder so hard because I was dying laughing.  And I'm going, she's, she's, she just, he just put bigger underwear on her.  Can we get this audio?  Oh, that's great.  Bill, you want to put a lace parachute around her? 
[01:29:30]  And then I'll just say, oh my God, where you've been all my life?  Bill, you want to produce this radio show?  We pay well.  All right.  Until the writer's strike is over.  The writer's strike is over because we need a producer, man.  Why don't we have the audio?  Dude, that's like my awful pasty white legs that everyone makes fun of from May to September of every year.  And all of a sudden you give me a little bit longer Jordan shorts, but you still see my awful pasty calves.  Right, yeah.  Oh my God, I feel so much more tanner. 
[01:30:00]  Well, here we go.  So Cressley's new lifetime show, How to Look Good Naked, takes the average women and shows them just how to make the most of what they've got.  And to be honest, it's hard to not feel great about yourself with Carson gushing all over you.  It's a gay guy, though.  What does he know about the naked freaking female body?  Gushing all over you is a little scary.  Right.  I don't like that part.  But what if you can't get him into your home?  Cressley has come up with 10 tips for daily news readers on how to fall head over heels in love with your body just in time for Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  Way number one, stand in front of Bob Kelly. 
[01:30:30]  This is all ridiculous stuff because it is about hefty women.  The woman in the daily news, picture of her, she's a big fat broad.  And do little things that make you feel pretty, is what he says.  Looking cute is feeling cute.  That's all there is to it.  No, it's not.  And they don't have to be big things.  It could be a day at the spa.  It doesn't have to be that.  It doesn't have to be a day at the spa. 
[01:31:00]  It could be something as quick and easy as pedicure or manicure.  Those little indulgences that tell your brain that you're worth it.  It could be a little box of Dunkin' Munchkins.  Right.  Or a big box or 20 of them.  But the whole thing is it says it doesn't matter what you can't see, that you can't see a physical change.  You'll feel it yourself.  Like, no, you're still fat.  You're still found unattractive by the majority of people out there.  You're a burden on a plane. 
[01:31:30]  There's plenty of other things.  You spill over into the next scene.  Yeah.  So doing little things to make yourself feel pretty ain't going to do it.  Look in the mirror is number two.  No, really take a look.  Be honest with yourself.  That's what they say.  On the show, the ladies stand in front and center, in the nude, in front of a three-way mirror, under fluorescent lights.  But you can do something similar at home.  But put post-it notes on your bathroom mirror. 
[01:32:00]  Take a good hard look at yourself.  Write down one or two things about your body that are great.  Next time you look in the mirror, you won't focus on your jiggly upper arms, but on your great boobs.  And you'll think to yourself, wow, I look great.  You know what this sounds like?  This sounds like they're fixing up like a dilapidated house.  And they're just sort of painting like the porch.  Yeah, yeah.  Paint the porch and that way.  It's got hardwood floors.  Yeah.  It's a great area.  If you paint the front door a bright color, you'll feel better about walking in to the disaster that is behind the door. 
[01:32:30]  Wait.  Look in the mirror.  And behind yourself, green screen African planes.  And a little bird on your back.  And a herd of rhinoceros.  A bird on your back.  You'll feel pretty and slender.  And little post-its all over the mirror.  You see, number three.  Get comfortable in your body.  Yeah.  Vacuum your living room in the nude.  It just makes it more normal and makes it more comfortable with your body.  But please close the blinds.  Yes.  Well, that's what they say. 
[01:33:00]  They go, just make sure you have some good quality blinds on the window.  Or not.  Oh, I get it.  Wow.  So people can go, oh my God, there's a fat broad vacuuming.  And she's naked.  Do your housework in the nude, especially scrubbing the toilet.  And then jam your finger down your fat throat and lose a few of those tons, you silly goose.  Just look out who's behind you when you vacuum under the couch.  John in New York has a great one.  John, go ahead.  Some people that have watched this show. 
[01:33:30]  Yes, John.  At one section of the show, they put these big broads in these, like, tinted outfits.  And they look like one of them old salamis that are hanging from the ceiling in the meat.  They make them look like salamis?  It's a little stuffed in.  Maybe a bologna.  I don't know.  Maybe not a salami.  I'm with you.  I like the visual.  Thank you, sir.  It messes.  Here's one that really gets me, because this is the give up factor.  Yeah.  Clean out your closet.  Don't worry about fitting into your skinny jeans. 
[01:34:00]  Invest in some clothes that make you look and feel really sexy.  Get something in a great color.  A pretty cashmere sweater in a sweet, pretty color can do wonders.  So that's pretty much, take your skinny pants.  Yeah, poncho or tint.  Take your skinny pants and throw them away.  Give up on the idea of ever fitting in them again.  That's the give up factor.  No.  Take your skinny pants.  Look at them and say, I got to get that skinny again. 
[01:34:30]  That way you'll look sexy.  Don't take it from a homosexual.  He's really not going to know what guys find attractive on these women.  He's parading around fatty.  He's thinking if he gussies them up in some colors that regular hetero guys are going to  be head over heels.  No.  Get something in a great color, which would be kind of like brown at the bottom, and  then it tapers up into green, and then it comes into white on the top of your hat like  a mountain.  This way you'll blend in with the scenery. 
[01:35:00]  Dress like a mountain.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  Hang a Sherpa in your closet.  Let's say hi to Pat and Belmore.  Pat, what's up?  I was going to say, gentlemen, that what Carson Cressley doesn't realize is that window dressing  is not going to create a Pygmalion-esque transformation.  I'm punching out.  I told you.  You got to use big words today in honor of Keith Overman.  That douche.  What other ones are good here?  Love yourself.  That's always a good one. 
[01:35:30]  Even on Valentine's Day, the first person you need to love and focus on is yourself.  Know that you're worth loving.  That's right.  It sounds like somebody's alone on Valentine's Day.  Exactly.  Even if you're alone, staring in that mirror, putting Post-it notes on about your boobs.  You're at home loving yourself while your husband's at work banging the secretary.  She's just crying on Valentine's Day.  Know that you're worth loving.  As you're on your hands and knees nude, eating a Whitman sampler like the pig that you are.  Not even using your hands. 
[01:36:00]  Just eating the paper that comes with it and everything.  On a little side note, don't forget others love you too.  If you have a great photo of yourself from a sexy night out, have a friend write something  nice on that photo telling you that you look hot or have amazing legs.  So you're supposed to take a picture, give it to a friend and go, could you write something  good on the back of this about me?  Hey, this looks like a nice restaurant you're in.  You'd look great laying on a plate with an apple in your mouth. 
[01:36:30]  Nice pic.  I loved you in Charlotte's Web.  Some picture.  That's all, folks.  Keep it in your purse and pull it out as a reminder if you start to feel down on yourself.  What a pathetic friggin' mess that is.  If you've got to go into your purse and look at a coerced statement written on the back of  a photo that you took of yourself.  Of a picture where you might look like you're a three.  An old picture.  I like number eight.  Take care of your skin.  Take a great exfoliating bath. 
[01:37:00]  I'm just picturing like a yak, you know, and they're itchy and they rub up against a tree.  Rub against an exfoliating tree.  If your skin feels pretty and sexy, so will you.  Really?  Sexy is as sexy does.  That's what mama said.  Retard.  Do things that make you feel alive.  Do activities that make you feel sexy with your clothes on.  Like raping a buffet.  Do that.  Taking two giant platefuls of food back to your lonely table. 
[01:37:30]  Dude, anybody could write this stuff.  Feeling beautiful is thinking beautiful.  Just look in the mirror and say, I am beautiful and you will feel more beautiful.  Can I have my check, please?  Yeah, you just did it.  Anyone can do this.  Tease your hair up.  Let me bounce you around the room.  Yeah, you'll feel better.  I'll do these activities, sexy activities with your clothes on and you'll feel better with  them off.  Go dancing or go flirting and get your endorphins pumping. 
[01:38:00]  And your appetite.  Do endorphins come in Entenmann's donuts?  That's what you want.  A big fat girl in the club all pumped up and looking for a hog.  Trying to flirt.  Nothing worse.  Just stop.  So where are you from?  Ringling Brothers, you're hired.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, you're on the O.P.  I'm a circus worker using an exfoliating brush on you.  Go through four or five loofah sponges on your awful body so they're smooth like marble. 
[01:38:30]  Have a friend hose you down with some perfume.  Try not to trample him.  Stand naked in the yard like in Pulp Fiction and just have somebody wash the sweat off your  back fat.  And wear sexy lingerie all the time.  Nice lingerie will make you feel beautiful.  A fab bra and underwear are your foundation for the whole day.  If you have granny panties and a torpedo bra on, you're not going to feel hot no matter 
[01:39:00]  what else you're wearing.  Have a good friend measure your ass crack.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Brian, what's up?  Brian.  Hey guys, hey, I was wondering if any of these girls are about a size 14.  They're about a size 14.  Where'd you?  Let's go to Brian in Dallas.  Sorry, sorry, Brian.  Help a gentleman put a couch in the back of his van.  Brian.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say no amount of clothes is going to fix a paucity of pulchritude. 
[01:39:30]  Thank you, Brian.  Wow.  He went to the alliteration too.  Yeah, I like it.  Rub the lotion on your skin.  Do this whenever you're told.  And put the lotion in the bucket.  Wear sexy leopard skin.  And if you don't have that, just borrow the curtains of a Puerto Rican.  These are all just crap.  Like Bill said, you can just make them up yourself. 
[01:40:00]  Feel good about you.  That's the most important thing.  Look in the mirror and say, I'm worth anybody out there.  Really?  Part your hair on the other side.  Give yourself a makeover.  Go out and come home as disappointed as you do every day.  Get some clip-on earrings and hang it on your other chin.  Embrace your double chin.  Dress it up. 
[01:40:30]  That's right.  Learn to do John Candy's voice so you can look and sound like him at parties and make everybody laugh.  Sean in North Carolina has one.  Sean.  Go to the beach for the day, but put up little notes letting Greenpeace know you're okay.  You're okay.  Nathan in Massachusetts, what's up?  Hey, yo, I was just wondering, does Jimmy still have around his little box of tender sentiments?  That just sounds like what he needs right now.  I forgot about that.  They do sound like Jimmy's tender sentiments.  They're tender sentiments for fat brats. 
[01:41:00]  For fatties.  That's right.  You're not fat.  The planet is just small.  And again, the gay guy is the worst guy that's going to tell a fat woman how to be sexy.  Because the bottom line is, lose weight.  You're going to get chubby chasers.  No doubt there.  You'll get some chubby chasers.  Fat chicks get laid all the time.  It's chubby chasers, though.  You're a fetish.  You're not looked at like a human. 
[01:41:30]  You're not looked at like a girl that guys are attracted to.  You're a fetish, like a foot or water sports.  When you decide to finally get the gym membership is when you become a fetish.  Yeah.  You're literally just...  Just a fetish.  An average guy isn't going to look at you, but there's guys that like feet.  There are guys that like water sports, they're called.  Things like that.  And there are guys that like fat broads. 
[01:42:00]  You're a fetish.  Go to the gym.  Men will have sex with you if they're afraid of abandonment.  If mother left when they were young, they'll be happy to hop on you because you'll never leave.  Will you?  Let's go to Corrine.  Corrine, what's up?  To feel sexy, match your bridle to your feedback.  Yeah, see?  You can make up your own at home.  Mindy in Arizona.  She used to be 350 pounds.  What's up, Mindy?  This is all crap.  None of it works.  It only works if you're really fat and don't want to lose any weight.  I used to try this stuff all the time and I thought I looked really great, but I was a cow. 
[01:42:30]  Okay?  It doesn't work.  It's the lazy way out.  It really is.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You know, it takes hard work.  It means eating a few salads every once in a while and doing a few crunches like Bill said to start this bit.  So, you know, this is the lazy way to come up with a little tender sentiment.  Yeah, yeah.  Just make you feel good about it.  And there's this whole thing going on with fat people.  I'm not talking about chunky girls, something like that, because, you know, everybody likes a little bit of something. 
[01:43:00]  Some people like emaciated girls and some people like them a little chunky and everything in between.  I'm talking about fat girls.  You see them out there and there's this whole thing now where it's completely acceptable.  It's accepted.  You're not to criticize it, make fun of it.  The clothing stores are putting out lines where they can feel like they're being sexy, but they're not.  And it's just, like you said, the lazy way out. 
[01:43:30]  Just go to the gym.  Absolutely.  Don't eat.  And any time you ask them, oh, no, I had a salad and I had this.  I'd love to follow them around with a camera one day.  You'd probably eat the camera.  We got a problem.  We got someone complaining.  It's Brett in Canada.  Brett.  Yeah, so I find that the way that you, the reprehensible way that you are speaking of the pituitary Rubenesque women is arduous, assiduous, reprehensible. 
[01:44:00]  And?  And so forth.  So forth.  Thank you, Brett, from Canada.  Ant loves chicks with breasts bigger than his head, right?  No.  You do?  I'm not into, no.  What have I ever been into girls with, like, giant breasts?  I don't like that look.  I just don't like that whole look.  North Carolina checking in.  Sean, what's up?  Giant stripper cans.  Remember, remember, convex mirrors and 40-watt light bulbs are your friends. 
[01:44:30]  40-watt bulbs.  Yeah.  Fun house mirrors for everybody.  Alaska is your friend for six months out of the year.  All right.  We got to get audio from this show.  This sounds like.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oot.  Listen to the homosexual try to tell the girls how to dress.  Hey.  That'd be sexy.  Tim down the hall decided to play the bleep game with the audio.  First, get a schlong.  The MSNBC audio, Chelsea being pimped out.  Yeah.  Tim took that audio and did this. 
[01:45:00]  Edit a few bleeps.  And, Bill, there's just something a little bit unseemly to me that Chelsea's out there  calling up celebrities saying, support my mom.  And apparently she's also calling these superdelegates.  Hey.  She's working for.  That's not the right track, unfortunately.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Obviously my fault.  Here's Schuster with a few bleeps.  And, Bill, there's just something a little bit unseemly to me that Chelsea's out there  c***ing celebrities saying, c*** my mom. 
[01:45:30]  And apparently she's also c*** these superdelegates.  Hey.  She's c*** for her mom.  What's unseemly about that?  I mean, during the last campaign, the Bush twins were out c***ing for their dad.  I think it's great.  I think she's grown up in a political family.  She's got politics in her blood.  She loves her mom.  She thinks she'd make a great president.  Michelle Obama's out there for her husband.  But doesn't it seem like Chelsea's sort of being pimped out in some weird sort of way?  No.  She's there.  Listen.  If she didn't want to c***, she wouldn't c***. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, give Chelsea a break.  I think it's great.  Again, Michelle Obama's out there c***ing for her husband.  What's the big deal?  Oh.  Good beeps.  Good beeps segment.  Tim from down the hall.  Who's actually working on the show as the show goes on?  Live.  Good man.  Good man.  How to look good.  Naked clip.  Is it good?  All right.  Well, we got some audio from this show we were just discussing.  Beautiful.  Oh, good.  We'll do that after the break.  Let's not forget Bill Burr on Letterman this Friday night. 
[01:46:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony?  Man, a lot going on today.  Hey, you know that commercial we just played about a half hour ago for Pie Face?  Yeah.  You want to tell the people just in case they're just tuning in, Ant?  Yeah, it was a game.  Back in 1968, I think it was put out, called Pie Face.  And little kids would put a pie or some whipped cream or whatever on this little hand that was pressed down. 
[01:47:00]  I guess it was spring activated.  And they'd put their face in a little cardboard thing with a circle cut out for their face and crank this handle.  Break their nose.  Yeah.  And after a while, their hand would unlatch and spring up with the pie and smash them in the face with it.  And we'll have the TV commercial from 1968 up on onaradio.com later today.  Well, Sam took it and did the beep game with the original audio that we just played.  Yeah.  So keep what Anthony said in mind here. 
[01:47:30]  It sounds a little different, by the way.  Yeah.  With the beeps.  I'm sure.  It's the face.  The goofiest, funniest game.  It's a game and it's new.  Get your face full of goo.  It's the face.  Something else you can do.  The without the goo.  It's the face.  Fun for you and grown-ups, too.  Face from the school.  That's different. 
[01:48:00]  Wow.  That was a suggestion by one of the listeners.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  That makes it sound a little different.  Yeah.  So easy sometimes, this radio.  It's all you have to do to get a laugh.  All right.  We got audio of that show we were just discussing with.  Discussing.  Discussing.  With Carthin.  Yes.  What is the name of the show, Bill?  The one you would laugh at with your girl.  Oh, the.  Gay guy and fat chicks. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I don't know what it's called.  Something like that.  Anyone know what it's called?  Let's ride this into the ground.  And he means the fat girl.  Like she's a steer.  What's it called, Danny?  Bulldog.  It's How to Look Good Naked.  That's the name of the show.  Oh, okay.  I look good naked.  And it's a gay guy showing you how to look good naked, ladies.  Good luck to you.  That's right.  How does that make sense?  Put a metal stall in front of you and then cut a hole, a glory hole in it, and you look  terrific naked.  Negative. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Audio.  Take off your top.  Just to let you know, 85% of all women are wearing the wrong size bra.  85% of women wear the wrong size bra?  You took your top off like a stripper named Amber.  I mean, like it was like in a second.  So it's not deep enough in the cup because the underwire needs to lay against the rib cage  in order to give it to the lip.  Just to let you know, only 10% of the support should come from the strap.  90% of the support of the bra should come from the band. 
[01:49:30]  And when the band is.  No, it was just, it was such devastating information.  All right, let's try some bras on.  This gives her that nice, dramatic plunging effect.  Just going back to this, when you were seeing, you know, those rolls here that you were so  concerned about, when you have the right bra, you don't have those rolls.  No, you do.  Body, wrong bra.  You cannot tell me that this doesn't make you feel hot.  See, he doesn't understand that we have to deal with this crap. 
[01:50:00]  Like he's, he's never going to go there.  So to him, it's like, oh, you're fixed.  Look, you look great.  He doesn't have to take that bra off and see that mess.  If you're wearing a bra that gives you those rolls, they're called back breasts.  You ever see those?  They pop up and they look like they're breasts on the back.  Well, he's talking about the front too.  It's like, it's called ripple boobs.  What?  Really?  It kind of ripples out.  It doesn't matter what you're wearing.  You're still going to get those.  The bottom part of a jack-in-the-box. 
[01:50:30]  Accordion stomach.  Accordion.  Lasagna belly.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  I really don't think, I don't think a bra is going to help that.  No.  Wrong bra.  You cannot tell me that this doesn't make you feel hot.  I love this outfit on me.  Okay.  You still can't verbalize it.  Okay.  Let's get you out.  Miss.  It's fun running around in our underwear all day, isn't it?  Turn all the way around here.  This is very flattering on the butt.  A little cheeky on the butt.  I feel really sexy. 
[01:51:00]  You feel sexy?  Yes.  You feel sexy?  I know.  Oh, my God.  She's come too.  Do you see how they like coax the person into saying it?  Yeah, just say it.  You cannot tell me that you don't look sexy because if you do, then this show is pointless.  Do you feel sexy?  She's not sexy.  You're hot, right?  Say it.  You're hot.  You're not fat anymore, right?  Right?  This show works. 
[01:51:30]  She's a mess and you're lying to her.  You're building her up.  She's going to get trashed.  Yeah.  You know what?  Now she's going to walk into a club and rather than have that, yeah, I know I'm fat, but  you know, kind of vibe.  She's going to come in there with like an attitude.  Yeah.  Just like she's an eight or a nine.  And she's going to leave gravely disappointed.  Dreadfully.  Yeah, sexy!  It's all in the right bra.  You put it over your mouth like a surgical mask.  You won't be able to eat.  What else is going on today? 
[01:52:00]  Well, fill your bra full of food.  We did the Clemens wife thing.  We did Roy.  We lost Roy.  Roy Scheider.  Scheider from Jaws, 75.  Hey, what age do you not feel bad?  Say Heath Ledger died at 28.  You feel bad.  75.  It's not tragic.  Roy Scheider, 75.  Don't feel bad.  It's still tragic.  75 is young these days. 
[01:52:30]  Nah.  It really is.  No, no, but you don't feel bad.  Oh, I don't care about any of them.  It's young.  I don't feel bad about Heath Ledger either.  Who cares?  I was going to creep out by it.  You were creeped out by it?  Yeah, just like the whole thing of somebody could fast forward your life.  Because, you know, if you die, okay, like within a week you're in the ground.  Yeah.  So if you went to like a fortune teller, where am I going to be in a week?  Oh, God.  You're just in the ground.  You're morbid, man.  Yeah, that's what I'm just thinking.  It's creepy.  That is creepy.  Heath Ledger, it took two and a half weeks to get him in the ground. 
[01:53:00]  That body was just rolling around a pine coffin for two and a half weeks.  They finally buried him.  Well, they had to, you know, go through all the tests and stuff and fly him back to...  Well, no, they had to take him to L.A. first.  Yeah.  And then they went to Perth.  Of course.  Australia.  What else?  We did the Chelsea thing.  Pat O'Brien back in rehab.  Yeah.  What's this for?  Is it drugs or is it that sex problem he's got?  Oh, no, no.  It's...  I think he's admitting to Alki Hall.  Oh. 
[01:53:30]  I thought he was making more of those phone calls.  Those fun phone calls.  He's...  Me, you, Betsy, a prostitute, cocaine.  Let's go.  Me, you, Chelsea Clinton.  Chelsea Clinton.  I hear the Clintons are pimping her out.  No, it was figurative.  I don't care.  Someone named Chelsea.  Me, you, David Schuster.  Keith Olbermann.  Undisclosed reasons.  Undisclosed reasons.  O'Brien and his doctors felt this is the best course for maintaining his sobriety.  Wait a minute.  Let me straighten everybody out here.  You don't maintain sobriety by going to rehab.  You have to go and get your sobriety back. 
[01:54:00]  See, no one says, well, I'm still sober.  Time for rehab again.  It's so I can maintain it.  You maintain your sobriety through doing certain footwork and following suggested steps and calling certain people.  That's how you maintain it.  You begin the process by going to rehab.  So, apparently, old Pat has tumbled face first.  That's what I'm guessing.  Also, the hockey thing.  We haven't even talked about the hockey thing.  No, that is...  The skate to the throat.  Have you seen it yet, Bill?  I saw the...  You saw the...  Yeah, I saw it at a bar last night. 
[01:54:30]  They were playing it on the news this morning.  A lot of times.  And from every angle.  And slow motion.  And all you see is a skate come up.  Hit a player on the neck.  Like, he grabs at his throat as he falls down.  And blood gushes in a line.  Yeah.  A continuous puddle line on the ice as he's falling down.  Wow.  It's just pumping out of his neck.  And they showed that over and over again.  You know, he fell down, but the blood hit the ice before he did. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, it did.  That's how fast that came out.  Because it was pumping out of his neck.  You know how...  His heart must have been beating like crazy anyway.  He's playing hockey, for God's sake.  Yeah, it's on YouTube.  This thing is going to be viewed like crazy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you see that?  It's like Tarantino film.  It's Richard Zednik.  So what happened?  He must have hit his jugular?  Look at this.  Yeah, it looks like it.  Right on the side, right?  This thing right here.  Boom.  God, man.  Yeah, he's in bad shape.  And then he skates off the ice really fast.  That blood...  ...comes out. 
[01:55:30]  It's so much blood.  Instantly, too.  What do they do?  Like, how do you stop that bleeding to get him anywhere?  I guess they always have an ambulance there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  You've got to do it...  I would think...  You've got to stop it immediately, though.  Look how much blood he lost in the first half a second.  I don't know if they got his jugular.  Jesus.  Yeah, he'd be dead.  That would be insane.  He'd be dead.  Much darker colored blood.  Yeah.  That has to be his jugular.  Look how fast it comes out.  What else could it be?  It could just be any vein or artery in there. 
[01:56:00]  I don't know, not if it's out that fast.  It's a blood pack.  Vince McMahon is doing the NHL now.  Yeah.  Blood on the ice.  That's right.  We're going to get some skates slicing some necks over here.  It's WWE hockey.  You're bleeding.  The XHL.  XHL.  I tried it with football.  It flopped.  That's right.  It flopped.  Thanks.  Don't be an Anthony.  But now we're doing it with hockey. 
[01:56:30]  No rules.  They could skate around with razor blades and cut each other on the neck.  That's what I want to see.  Women goalies.  They could be raped in the crease.  That's right.  Raped.  Wow, Vince.  That's an insane idea.  I am at sight.  And you're fine.  I'm dreadfully sorry.  Dreadfully.  I want to apologize to anyone I offended by my nude, raped, goalie comment. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, I didn't say they were nude before.  Well, they're going to be nude.  That's right.  Nude.  Completely naked.  Everything's going.  Breast.  No cups.  The video will be up on onaradio.com of Richard Zednick getting slashed.  You know what that reminds me a long time ago?  To the neck.  Bruins game.  Gary Galley.  Same thing happened to him.  Not in the neck, though.  Somebody cross-checked somebody so the guy's feet came up and basically kicked this. 
[01:57:30]  Gary Galley.  He had a scar going, like, started above his lip, went right through his lip.  Oh, man.  The greatest one ever was the goalie.  Was it the Sabres goalie back in the day?  I forget.  He was just bleeding.  Oh, yeah.  He got sliced right across the entire throat and was just bleeding.  Oh, yeah.  That is a sick, sick tape.  I think you can still find that on YouTube.  Did he die or no?  They were able to stitch him up, I believe.  No, I don't think he died.  He came back out for the third period.  No.  Hockey, man.  Hockey.  That's what they do in hockey. 
[01:58:00]  Look at me.  No.  We got to try to find that one.  That one is insane, too.  In other news, high school male basketball team, oh, boy, made player have sex with teammates.  Oh, wait a minute.  Basketball team?  You know what?  That's just bad parenting.  Sex with teammates.  Okay.  Teach your kid how to say no.  Right.  Teach your kid how to say some things just aren't worth it.  How bad do you want that varsity letter?  Yeah.  Is it really that important?  How much fun is pond hockey?  I mean, come on. 
[01:58:30]  Isn't that better?  Three members of a freshman high school boys basketball team are expected to be charged  Monday with gross sexual imposition after an alleged assault on a teammate.  Insidious.  Insidious.  A police officer wrote in a report that the alleged victim said a teammate made him have  sexual contact with another teammate.  He said touch his ball bag.  Is that what he said?  You think it was just something almost okay?  What do you get in that bill?  Oh, is that a sick shot? 
[01:59:00]  Here it is.  This is a hockey goalie gets slit and cut up.  This is, yeah.  He doesn't know what to do.  Oh, my God.  The blood from today is worse than this blood dripping out.  No, it's not because the ref's not even looking at him.  The guy's bleeding out like a stuck pig alone in the corner.  Yeah, he's bleeding out.  And a couple of guys are ready to duke it out.  They're ready to throw the gloves off.  Yeah, we'll get that up on onaradio.com later, too.  The cameraman couldn't get further away from that, too.  He's just like, ooh, let me pan out.  Oh, he's bleeding immediately.  Wow.  Right from the neck.  He grabs his neck.  But it's spitting out. 
[01:59:30]  It's like a line of blood, man.  It's a stream coming out of a...  And no one is paying attention.  He's off to the side bleeding.  Not even the cameraman.  They finally get help on the ice.  And then didn't the guy have to come out with the scraper and starts...  Because the blood froze on the ice?  Yeah.  You got to scrape that off?  Yeah, that's back when they had guys doing that.  Now they have like those ice whores that go out.  Yeah, ice whores.  They're like 16-year-old girls.  Yeah, they fill in the little holes.  It's great.  The Islanders started that tradition.  And now all the other teams do it, or most of the other teams do it. 
[02:00:00]  I can't stand that moment.  Ice whores.  Heather Mills is going to represent...  Oh, sorry.  I always yell out, have some respect for yourselves.  Like, what are you, the old codger?  Have some respect for yourselves.  Granddaughter of mine would never be out there.  Why?  I just hate how they just think I'm such a moron that I can't even be talking about the game  during that moment.  Like, I need constant entertainment.  There's a stoppage of plays.  Get some whores.  Get some whores out there.  Have them clean up the ice. 
[02:00:30]  That's brilliant.  That's the experience.  By the way, going backwards, Paul W.  from Austin writes, he effing skated off the ice.  How do you guys glaze over that?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was...  Well, you'll do something like that.  In that situation, it's very hard to just kind of relax and lay down.  You're going to run.  I'm sure on the ice.  It's cold.  Yeah.  Everybody...  You ever hear of, you know, people when they're shot, they always wind up running somewhere  and collapsing on a stoop?  Yeah, before...  You never get shot and go, oh, let me call a cab. 
[02:01:00]  Hello?  Yeah, I know I'm here.  I'm shot.  You try running somewhere.  Just, I got to run somewhere.  Fight or flight.  Flight takes over.  Yeah, flight takes over and...  Boop.  You just kind of die.  That's all your brain's saying, skate.  Skate.  Skate.  Just skate.  Skate away.  In other news, Heather Mills is going to represent herself in the divorce case with Paul McCartney.  Why is she doing that?  So she could talk to him.  She's going to be the one like...  Oh, boy.  That's great. 
[02:01:30]  So that's going to be interesting.  Man faces child abuse charges after home circumcision.  I wonder...  Wait a minute.  I wonder if that will work.  Like, are you going to tell the jury that you and I never said this?  Or did you ever say to me...  That might actually work, man.  I don't know.  It might be harder for him to lie.  And her inflection may be able to get a lot of points across that a lawyer wouldn't.  Like, did you ever hit me when you were drunk?  No.  You didn't.  There was never a time we were sitting together and you hit me when you were drunk. 
[02:02:00]  In the pantry?  Yeah.  There may be a way for inflection to do it without being caught in court.  To work both ways.  To the jury.  Remember Colin Ferguson when he was defending himself?  I have more respect for him, actually, than I do for her.  But yeah, it's a bit of a different case.  He went out there and he was like, now, and he would talk about himself as the defendant.  He'd say, now, when the defendant pulled out a gun, tell me what happened next.  And then the witness on the stand went, well, I saw you pull a gun out and you pointed it at me and you shot me. 
[02:02:30]  So it really didn't work very well with him trying to separate himself from...  So I shot you.  Yes.  Yes, yes.  Okay, so you're saying the defendant, you shot me.  Yeah, Heather Mills is not denying that she's the ex-wife to me.  Do you recognize the pogo stick in this courtroom?  Looking right at you, love.  Love.  Love.  Yes.  Old Stumpy.  Did you not have a nickname for George? 
[02:03:00]  Did you not refer to him as Tapioca Under the Hat?  I'd like to settle.  I can't do the rules.  Settle.  That looks bad.  He was me friend.  He was me bloke.  He was me mate.  But you called him old puddin' head, didn't you?  Imagine if she starts talking about the sexual practices, if she can somehow tie that into abuse or tie that into her case.  You could really embarrass a guy because he's a private guy, man. 
[02:03:30]  He doesn't want his...  That'll get you to go to that back room and settle real quick.  Oh, man.  What happened?  That's a beetle, man.  He should not have to go through.  Oh, it's an old beetle now.  Exactly.  Hire a hitman.  Good lord.  He's got some residuals, right?  Residuals.  He'd end up in prison.  Imagine that.  Paul McCartney in prison.  Put potholes in front of her house.  Just watch her attempt to walk and that leg snaps off.  Just standing there looking at her like she's silly.  Hires a hitman to break a knee. 
[02:04:00]  He hits the fake leg.  Does nothing.  She still showed up.  You hit the wrong one, mate.  Blimey.  We're starting a new bit.  What's that?  We'll debut it here.  Oscar moments.  Because we had so much fun with Grammy moments.  Yes, we did.  With the gang.  So now we're going to be doing Oscar moments.  All right.  Here's the first one coming in from Derek.  The O.B. and Anthony Show presents Oscar Moments. 
[02:04:30]  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films.  Today's Oscar moment comes from No Country for Old Men.  Well, look.  I need to know what I stand to win.  Everything.  How's that?  You stand to win everything.  Call it.  All right.  Heads in.  Well done.  Don't put it in your pocket.  Sir?  Don't put it in your pocket.  It's your lucky quarter.  Stay tuned for more Oscar Moments presented by the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:05:00]  Now, I hate to be critical.  I know what you're going to do.  I don't know what bothers me more about that clip.  A, the fact that Kenny is actually a better actor than Voss.  Or B, the fact that he says, good, good job, before the coin hits.  Before the coin hits.  You hear him say that, and then you hear a clink, clink.  Good job, 30 seconds.  Clink, clink.  That's what I say, kid. 
[02:05:30]  Dummy.  Oh, yeah.  Bethel Kenny was at least had some kind of acting chops.  Roland, actually, he has that natural nervousness.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where it works in that situation.  And doesn't in life.  We love Roland.  Okay.  Chicago radio host suspended after anti-Semitic remark.  Go ahead.  Make my day.  Yeah?  What?  I usually have one sugar, but it's this year.  It's a lot of sugars in it today. 
[02:06:00]  Came back to see you.  We're going to need a bigger vote.  Oh, right.  You ever seen 52 Pickup?  That's a great Roy Scheider movie.  You ever seen that?  Uh-uh.  Oh, my God.  You guys got to watch it.  He's married to Ann-Margaret, and they blackmail him with this girl he's seeing.  And it's Clarence Williams III, and two other guys.  And they kidnap his wife.  And the guy puts heroin, gives her heroin, and bangs her when she's all doped up.  And then he gives her back to Roy Scheider.  He goes, that's a fine bitch you got there, sport.  Oh, God.  She's old, but she still cooks. 
[02:06:30]  You know what's going on?  Oh, wow.  Sport.  He calls him sport.  Judo.  Judo told me that Roy actually one time when he hosted SNL way back in the day actually  tried to come out and do stand-up.  And he said it's horrific.  I don't know if you can find the clip.  Oh, we should find that.  Yeah, if you find it.  That'd be good.  Like, really overselling the jokes and just completely bombing.  And if we had the clip, that would...  Yeah, that would really tie it all together.  I'm an idiot. 
[02:07:00]  That would mean someone actually looking up Roy clips before the show today.  Right, Iraq?  Why would we do that?  Yeah, of course not.  Should this guy have been suspended?  Chicago Talker, sidelined.  From WMVP, weekend talk host Chet Koppok, has been suspended for comments he made on  the show earlier this month.  In exchange with co-host Ben Finfer, he was asked, how do you spell Jewish?  To which he responded, M-O-N-E-Y. 
[02:07:30]  I don't get it.  Spelled wrong.  Yeah.  That spells my head doesn't spell Jewish.  In a statement, this cop, Pac, had to apologize, and he said, I made an offensive comment I  truly regret.  I sincerely apologize.  He's off the air until February 23rd.  Well, what kind of show is it?  I mean, is it a legitimate news show or is it a comedy show?  Or is it a goofy show?  I don't know.  And by the way, anyone that says, how can you spell Jewish?  What was the set of it?  Do we know anything about this show?  Mm-mm.  Yeah, why would that question be asked? 
[02:08:00]  Do we have any audio of that?  Like, like...  Because I really lobbed it over the net.  Yeah, he kind of just, here, take this.  Take this and get suspended.  What kind of legitimate news guys go, by the way, how do you spell Jewish?  For the sake of the story on the air.  J-E-W-I-S-H.  Thank you.  Thanks.  We'll be back.  I was using an H and a B and a couple of E's.  Thank God you straightened that out.  What's the matter with these people?  But he got suspended.  And, wow, some of the people here on PalTalk are spelling it in ways that would get them more than suspended. 
[02:08:30]  Really?  Yes.  And then, finally, I think we have time for this really interesting story.  Family and friends of a missing and injured Iraq war veteran are afraid he's covering his tracks.  24-year-old Eric Hall of Punta Gorda has been missing for a week.  He recently stopped taking his pain medication for a leg injury he sustained in Iraq.  He also may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to his family.  His family also says just before he disappeared, he was playing a video game that may have brought back some painful memories. 
[02:09:00]  You want to guess the game?  Medal of Honor?  Call of Duty.  Call of Duty, yes.  Yes, Call of Duty 4.  So the guy's playing Call of Duty and that might have, you know, triggered something in his brain.  Oh, boy.  And then he went missing.  Maybe he was just listening to Bob Kelly's babbling on it, and that was too much for him.  Just had to get away.  Wow.  Yeah, well, the game, I wonder.  I wonder if you're a vet.  You've been through all that crap. 
[02:09:30]  You start playing that game.  A lot of death.  You know, shooting, snipers.  Me.  I don't know the game.  Oh, it rules.  Come on.  It rules.  It rules.  How old are you?  I'm old enough to say it rules.  I'll never stop saying it rules.  You really are just a big teenager.  You've seen the game?  I'm a jerk.  It rules.  I play it all the time on my Xbox.  More to the story, which is kind of creepy.  After playing Call of Duty, Eric Hall just got up and said he had to go.  He rode away in a motorcycle that was later found on a roadside, still running. 
[02:10:00]  Just, like, got off his motorcycle and left.  Walked into a swamp.  He had been hallucinating and having flashbacks, yeah.  Wow.  Yee.  So.  That's nasty.  And you can't blame the guy.  He was injured over there fighting the war.  During the same incident that he was injured, he witnessed his best friend being decapitated.  Oh, okay.  By the way, we're just under 4,000 dead.  Oh.  Something they like to kind of, like, brush under the old rug. 
[02:10:30]  But we're heading toward 4,000 dead over there.  That's all.  That's all I want.  You know that people deserve freedom.  And they want it.  Yeah, of course they do.  4,000.  I'm sure they do.  4,000.  Democrats are focusing on the election now.  So, they have other priorities.  And the war they said they were going to stop.  Nothing.  I still want to see Obama get in.  I really do.  I want the economy to go back up.  I don't know if that'll help, but it couldn't hurt. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Well, good luck.  It's just going to be a big distraction.  If Hillary or Obama gets in.  It's a big distraction.  It's going to be exciting.  It is.  It's going to be exciting for everybody.  Exciting?  Yeah.  Yeah, comedians.  It'll be good for us.  McCain will be a bore.  But, oh, Hillary won't be.  Neither will Obama.  McCain's backstory is unbelievable.  Just reading it in Newsweek.  He can't raise his arms beyond a certain point for being repeatedly broken during captivity.  Just beaten. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, it was just brutal.  He had, like, bleeding in his stomach from having, you know, a percentage of rocks in his diet.  I mean, the guy just went through unbelievable.  Do you think the Asian Americans feel like they would be best represented by him?  Yeah.  Or do you think there's still this grudge that he holds just looking into Asian people's eyes?  There's no way.  There's no way you couldn't be.  You want to talk about flashbacks.  Yeah.  There's no way.  No, that guy, he went through.  He's like the real Rambo.  He literally was like, this is how they tell the story anyways. 
[02:12:00]  Like, he was flying towards his target.  He knew there was a missile locked on him, and he did the Star Wars.  Stay on target.  Stay on target.  And he thought he could get away.  Last time, right as he dropped his bomber, it, like, blew off his right wing.  And the second he ejected, he was going so fast, he immediately broke both arms and one of his legs.  Lands in a swamp.  A North Vietnamese guy came up with his rifle butt, broke one of his shoulders, and then it said, stabbed him with a bayonet in his ankle and groin.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:12:30]  This is uncomfortable laughing.  That was his welcome to Vietnam.  That's how it started.  Wait, he landed both arms broken and a leg broken?  He landed, like, parachute.  No, no, no.  He ejected from the plane, and I guess the force of it.  That broke his arms and his legs.  Immediately broke both arms, one of his legs.  He lands in the swamp, and then, you know, just for good measure, to add to the, oh, my God, I'm a POW now.  The guy breaks his shoulder and stabs him a couple times with a bayonet.  How long was he at POW for?  Something like five and a half years or something.  Five years he was at POW? 
[02:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  And beaten constantly during that period.  Yeah, because he comes from, like, a military family.  Like, his family was, like, ridiculous, like, fought in just about every war.  And the family also had this watch that they would pass from generation to generation.  So he had to deal with that, which was very uncomfortable.  No, it's unbelievable.  I'll be damned.  That's unbelievable.  Man, every day. 
[02:13:30]  So you think, like, when he's got to meet with an Asian group as president of the United States, he's going to give them the time of day?  Dude, they must have, like, one of those filters around the mic so he can just, out the side of his mouth, have a little Tourette's, just yell out some bad stuff about Asians.  Well, he got criticized, and really, consider this before you dump out of it, because this is in the news.  He got criticized for using the derogatory term gook.  I remember that, yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Using that term to describe his captors and the people that beat him.  And was then criticized for it, and he said, I'm never going to call the people that had me captured and tortured me anything but that.  Good for him.  So, you know, he's sticking to that one.  He says, he's not calling all Asians that, or even all Vietnamese that.  Just, he meant his captors, the people that beat him on a daily basis, will always be that to him.  Who criticized him?  Asian groups, yeah.  I know.  Go through that, and then tell me if you wouldn't make up a good name for who did that to you. 
[02:14:30]  Dude, my eyes were watering up, reading it, like, not crying, but just, like, just, like, thinking of the king.  The horror.  Oh.  Wow.  Watering up is what we define as crying, Bill.  No, no, you know, it's more like you look in the sun and that kind of thing, you know, that kind of, there's all kinds of different watering.  I cried, it's beauty.  You cried, it's beauty.  All right, we got to get out of here.  Come on.  We're going over to XM.  Bill Burr's going to be on Letterman on Friday night.  Friday, that's right.  Taping tonight, but it's going to be shown Friday. 
[02:15:00]  And I'll be in San Francisco this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  It's a holiday weekend.  What I call it, Sandy Franny.  Sandy Franny.  I'm kidding, of course.  Oh, that's good.  I like Frisco.  Yeah, Frisco.  Yeah.  All right.  Have a good day, guys.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.B. and Anthony. 
[02:15:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony. 
[02:16:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony. 
[02:17:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  You guys were all having the entire time I was in L.A. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  They were pissing me off every time I called back.  Yeah, it's not bad.  It's like 40, 45.  I'm like, damn it.  I know.  That annoys you when you're away.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  I get my fucking ears shot.  I'm sorry.  You all right?  I got to mean to yell while you're talking.  Yeah, I just sat down.  That's the worst feeling, man.  Yeah, when you're away on vacation and stuff, and it's some nice warm place, you always  hope where you live is freezing cold.  Oh, you want the apocalypse.  Yeah.  And then they're like, no, it's been real mild.  Do we around?  The second you left, dude. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, you're like, God damn it.  Yeah.  Bill said, remind me to tell you what an old guy, did he say?  Old guy said about my car?  Yeah.  As soon as we left the other joint, Bill's like, oh, I got it.  Yeah, I got the hybrid, the Prius.  Of course you did.  But I got to tell you, for LA, it literally is the perfect car.  I drove it to Vegas.  Once we got to the mountains, dude, it was awful.  I was driving up the hill, and it's like, ah, coming from my mind.  I was like, what the hell is that?  Literally, it was the engine screaming. 
[02:20:30]  Like, screaming in pain.  It was ridiculous, man.  Like, I forgot it has like a 1.6 liter with this, you know, this electronic gizmo.  But I'm telling you, it's great for city and everything.  So, just because, you know, Anthony, you've been trashing my car.  I'm literally going to the gym.  And it's this cute, you know, this old guy.  Everybody loves an old guy, and he's just sitting there.  And as I get out of the car, I go walk by.  He goes, hey, excuse me, excuse me.  I'm like, what's up?  I thought you wanted, like, directions or something, my help across the street.  He goes, I got to ask you a question.  How do you like your little wind-up car? 
[02:21:00]  And I'm so bad in the moment.  I should have been like, how do you like your depends, you old fuck, right?  But I literally just answered him.  I'm like, oh, you know, it's great in the city.  I just had this long, stupid conversation with him.  Not even realizing this old fart was just trashing me.  Insulting you, and you're just giving him answers?  Yeah.  Yeah, I like it.  I was saying earlier, hey, I heard your mother's a whore.  Well, she's always been sociable.  What a fucking moron I am. 
[02:21:30]  What's worse than when someone insults you and you forget, oh, yeah, I do this for a living.  Dude, I am so bad.  Like, I'm like, three minutes later, I'm like, did that guy, hey, you just called my mother a whore.  I should have said something.  Should have defended her there.  I came off looking like an ass.  Oh, yeah.  I was on the treadmill, like, for the rest of my workout.  I just kept thinking of snappy answers that I should have said.  Oh, yeah, that you should have said.  But didn't.  How is the wind-up car?  Dude, I got to admit, it's an undefendable car.  If you're going to say it's a gay-looking car, I can't defend it. 
[02:22:00]  They can just make them look cooler.  You know what?  I didn't realize.  Honda has one that actually looks...  It looks all right?  That actually looks like a car.  It has full-size tires.  Yeah, you got those little skateboarders.  All I want to say is if you're going to take it for a test drive, make sure there's a hill or something.  Yeah, go up a hill so you can hear the engine.  Just screaming at you.  And is there a huge, huge savings on gas?  Huge.  Huge.  Huge, yeah.  Like, everybody knows I was paying like $45, $50. 
[02:22:30]  I'm like $27.  That's the time when you just smile.  And that fills your tank up, and then you can just drive around for just as long as everybody else.  Yeah, and if you know how to drive the car, you can drive for like fucking two weeks.  Really?  Oh, dude, it's awesome.  You know how to drive the car?  Like, you can't be gassing it?  No, I know.  Yeah, because if you stomp on the gas, then it switches over to gas, and then you'll...  I can't say just go through it like a regular tank, but it'll definitely start going down.  Like, I know a guy, he's a maniac.  He goes, dude, I'm not really seeing the savings.  And it's just like, you're driving like a moron. 
[02:23:00]  If you drive any car, basically is what I've learned through reading about this, you drive  any car like a maniac, and that even includes like stomping on the brakes, you get like  way less than what they projected, which of course, when they drove it, is completely  on flat land.  Yeah.  It's like a tailwind.  Optimum circumstances.  Two scientists pushing the car at the same time.  A sail on top.  Yeah.  No resistance whatsoever, right?  They, uh...  Yeah, no, I know that, but some people, like, I'm pretty aggressive with my driving.  Uh, I'll just say that, like, I'm, I'm kind of on the gas a lot. 
[02:23:30]  Um, if there's a spot that's opened up and I see it's closing, I kind of zoom up a little  bit, and then I got to step on the brakes, get over, jam on the gas again.  So I'm going through probably twice as much gas as I should be.  Yeah.  But, see, I don't have the patience to drive one of those hybrids like that.  Do you, do you, like, does this, do you give the gas very slow and, and kind of just...  No, you just don't, you don't, like, first of all, when you have a 1.6 liter, there's 
[02:24:00]  no point in stomping on the gas.  It's not going to do anything?  You know, it's like throwing it into, like, like an ice bath.  You just feel like, I'm like, fuck!  But, um, I'm telling you, but, like, dude, stop and go traffic is basically, like, traffic  is so fucking ridiculous.  It's absolutely ridiculous to have a nice car in LA unless you work, like, the night  shift at UPS.  That's the only time you can actually use the highways for what they were meant for, you  know?  Yeah, driving fast.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Or you're just stuck in traffic.  No, out there, it's literally, I was saying, no, the traffic out there, it's, you haven't  been...  No, no, in traffic, your car does, does well?  Dude, it's fucking awesome.  Yeah, because, like, when you're going that slow, it just shuts off.  It's all electric.  Totally electric.  It's like a golf cart.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It really is.  Just a fancier golf cart.  Aren't you afraid it'll break down, though, and just run out of spark?  That would scare me.  Dude, it's a Toyota.  You're kidding me?  They're like cockroaches.  Those things never die.  It just keeps, it'll just keep going, but...  Yeah.  I gotta tell you, the traffic out there, it's like, you remember that, the Truman Show,  every time he, the movie, every time he'd try to figure it out and try to get 
[02:25:00]  off, they'd start, like, a fire, and there'd be all this stuff coming in.  That's literally what happens out there.  You're finally going to be able to make a left, and then there's, like, somebody  walking across the street, and it can't just be, like, a regular young person who  can walk at a brisk pace.  It can be, like, some old Vietnamese lady with, like, one of those unpicking rice  hats, and you're just sitting there like, really?  Really?  This is the person?  It's just the hybrid.  That's holding up everything.  It's not going to hurt her.  I'll just go.  I'll just go right over her.  She'll get up.  Yeah, I'll bump her out of the way.  Hey, we allowed you to go buy real fast with that comment you made, Anthony. 
[02:25:30]  Sean in North Carolina, go ahead.  I'm not saying he's got an aggressive style of driving.  That's kind of like Hitler saying, yeah, I've got some ideas from social restructuring.  Oh, well, a little.  I'd say it's a little aggressive.  That's all.  Although, I want to say hi to the guy in the pickup truck, because I was driving out to  my mother's out there, exit 60-something, way out there on the expressway.  And I like getting out there pretty quick, so I took the rocket ship there yesterday.  And the guy in the pickup truck with a wow sticker, and I kind of pulled up past him, 
[02:26:00]  and he knew who I was.  Then I proceeded to just do 110 miles an hour to get away from him.  So why do you want to thank him for that?  Just for waving.  He kind of gave a good wave, a little thumbs up, a little recognition.  He had a wow sticker on his car, which was nice.  I saw a lot of him yesterday on the way out there, which is nice to see.  Yeah, absolutely.  So still pick him up.  How did he happen to see you?  Because your car's on MySpace?  Well, yes, maybe that was it. 
[02:26:30]  With the license plate?  See Anthony's car in the back?  Zoom.  I'm on the radio.  Fans of the show know what I drive.  He bought the first one, basically.  And there's now five out there.  So pretty good odds.  Some Acura tried to be a fast guy.  Like, I love when people, and this isn't, I'm not racing people, but it insults me when  a crappy, like, car where the spoiler's on the back, and you can tell that somebody... 
[02:27:00]  You can tell a snobby.  These people are beneath me.  Somebody probably is driving it of some other ethnic background that is, stereotypically drives  these smaller cars, and puts spoilers that are three feet high on the back, and spray  paints their rims gold, and stuff like that.  It's probably one of those.  Shoes?  Yeah, exactly.  And he was trying to keep up with me, and I was stuck in traffic, so I really couldn't  do anything.  But then once it opened up, you gotta show him. 
[02:27:30]  You do have to...  Just slap him around a little bit.  I gotta show you that it was stupid of you to even think you're keeping up with me.  So I took off really fast.  Hey, if we actually had a race, my car and your car, how many minute head start do you  think you could give me?  An hour.  If we were doing the quarter mile, just give me a look at an eight second head start.  Yeah, I could give you an eight second head start and still feed you.  That'd be a great YouTube video.  So... 
[02:28:00]  Just gotta communicate, MSNBC not talking yet there, Jimmy.  Sorry.  That's alright.  Not talking.  We're trying to get MSNBC on the show today, because of the Keith Overman crowd.  Left messages and emails out to their PR department.  Yes, we are trying to get them on to ask some questions.  This is a good day for Bill to be here, because he likes looking at sports.  You like looking at old time sports, too, for the most part, right?  Yeah, I love that stuff.  You love the days when there were bench clearing brawls in hockey.  Yeah, the benches faced each other. 
[02:28:30]  When fans destroy the field after their team won the championship, you go old school with  this stuff, right?  Anthony, and I remember this, I don't think Anthony remembered this, because he brought  this up in the office today.  There's a story on Stadium Memorabilia, and they're talking about how fans took tools to  Yankee Stadium back in 1973.  Do you remember this?  No.  They were remodeling Yankee Stadium, and the fans were aware of that, and I think they  were going to remove all the seats and put in new seats that were a little more comfortable. 
[02:29:00]  So, fans actually went to Yankee Stadium back in 1973 with tools so they could take their  own seat home.  Oh, my God.  And nobody did anything.  I know.  I was saying.  You probably walked in with a tool belt with a hammer hanging off the side.  I was saying, was there any security for anything in the 70s?  Like, you just kind of walked through a metal detector at the airport.  That was it.  All your friends and family could go up there to the gate with you.  And then, this situation, you're taking tools in to Yankee Stadium so when they shut it down 
[02:29:30]  to rebuild it for a couple of seasons, you could just take whatever you want and walk  out with it.  Which they did.  Like, now...  People have stadium seats from 1973 all over.  That's like when Hank Aaron was doing, like, the home run chase, you know, Pete Babe Ruth.  He was getting death threats on a daily basis.  He hits the home run.  There's, like, drunks running out on the field, slapping them on the back and stuff.  The guy's heart's going a mile a minute.  Is this the guy?  Is this the guy?  Is this the guy that's been writing me write? 
[02:30:00]  It's ridiculous.  There was no security.  There was no...  Like, I was reading, like, as far as, like, hijacked planes and that type of thing.  Like, back...  I think as much up until, like, the early 70s, I don't even think there was metal detectors.  I forget, I can't quite remember, like, when they actually put those in.  You just basically went to the airport and, you know, with your mutton chops and Fu Manchu  and you just walked right up to the gate.  Yeah.  Just walk right up to the gate.  And I remember that, like, friends and family could be right there and go, okay, bye.  They'd greet you when you got off the plane. 
[02:30:30]  He used to always meet...  Yeah, meet my dad.  Right there.  Hey, how you doing?  You didn't have to be on the flight to go through the security.  You could just go and grab...  I remember grabbing my parents.  Some guy tried to look at my penis in the airport bathroom.  Years ago.  Nice.  That would happen.  Did you let him?  No, I left.  Aw.  I went out and smoked a cigarette uncomfortably.  Fucking teased.  And saw mom and dad and neglected to mention it.  But their son's delicious cock just got stared at.  Some guy with a fucking beard.  But you could really just do anything you wanted. 
[02:31:00]  You could literally have, like, a box, like, on a cartoon that said TNT on the side of it.  Yeah.  Like, some hell with that, sir.  Is that a bomb?  No, no, I work for the network.  All right.  Like, hospitals with the smoking kills me, too.  They're just walking around in the hospital room, and the doctor would be smoking.  Yeah.  They'd be hanging out on the side of your mouth.  Ah.  People in the waiting rooms just smoking, in the ER, smoking. 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  We finally figured out it's a fucking hospital.  At least not in here.  Going back to the stadium seats, by the way, back in 73, when Yankee Stadium closed for  two seasons to be remodeled, fans carried tools to the last game of the season and tore  the place apart.  Okay.  Seats from the old Yankee Stadium before the mid-70s renovation were sold for $7.50.  Today, a mint-conditioned version of those seats sell for $2,500.  Nice.  It's a big jump up.  Sure is.  Who the hell would pay for that?  I've never understood that sports memorabilia. 
[02:32:00]  My dad does that.  Actually, you know something?  Old school stuff I could see buying.  But my dad will buy new stuff, not realizing that it's an industry now.  He'll call me on Bill.  Bill, you're not going to believe this.  Are you ready for this?  I got, I'm telling you, I got an official Manny Ramirez jersey.  Are you ready for this?  He's like all excited.  Autographed.  And I'm just like that.  He's fucking sitting at a table.  You probably signed 700 in that hour.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  You and 700 other people have that jersey.  Now I have this worthless jersey.  It's not going to be worth shit.  It's actually worth less because there's writing on it.  Dude, he's got all that.  Like a Movan jockstrap.  It's like that.  Nobody cares.  Hey, Cornhusker from Iowa.  In 1987, I went to Washington National Airport to say goodbye to my cousin.  I was at the gate, but she had already boarded the plane.  The airline person let me on the plane to say goodbye to her without screaming in any way. 
[02:33:00]  On the plane.  Amazing.  Could you still do that?  Wow.  Showstopper.  Yeah.  Because we're all thinking, what?  No.  Travis has stuff like what?  My dad actually has a huge collection.  We bought two seats from Memorial Stadium, where the Orioles used to play.  Do you sit in them?  No.  Do you ever just sit in them?  Somebody sat here and watched Boog Powell. 
[02:33:30]  Who gives a fuck?  Oh, it smells like beer farts.  What a shitty piece of memorabilia.  Somebody who never played baseball.  Some regular jackass sat here.  Sat here.  Sweating his ass off during Boog Powell.  A bunch of jackasses.  We have a brick from Memorial Stadium.  And we have dirt from the infield.  Wow.  Which is really from the infield.  Of course it's not.  Yeah.  No.  Who cares?  I remember my dad got me an autographed framed picture of Muhammad Ali.  And to prove its authenticity, they had a picture of Muhammad Ali signing a picture. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, there you go.  There it is.  That was my picture.  I love a certificate of authenticity that they come with.  Does this have a certificate?  Like the people would go, no, it's fake.  We're going to put one in that says so.  Yeah.  Fucking.  Isn't that big stupid gold seal?  Yeah.  Like you're a second grader and you spelled all the words right?  They just stamp it right on there.  And it doesn't prove anything, those certificates of authenticity.  It's just somebody that filled something out.  Yes, this is authentic, number blah, blah, blah. 
[02:34:30]  They stamp it and throw it in with the crap you just bought.  And not to be an asshole.  His signature was completely smooth.  Really?  Yeah.  And the guy's got Parkinson's.  I mean, I don't know how he.  That would be rough.  Fucking memorabilia like salesmen.  I think so many of them are thieves.  I love when they catch these scumbags.  That's why I like getting stuff signed.  Like when I know it's signed by the person.  It's like, I don't know why I'm saying that like it's an original thought.  I like an autograph that's actually signed by the person.  By the person that you're thinking is the autograph it's from. 
[02:35:00]  Speech.  Yes.  Yeah.  Boo.  Hey, Madam Misty, do you want to make a speech?  Speech.  We might be on to something here about the 70s.  Halitosis kid from Baltimore.  He writes, what about getting pulled over after a couple of beers only to be told by  the cop to go home and be careful?  The 70s rocked.  Plenty of those stories.  Go straight home.  Sleep it off.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Or get in the car.  I'll drive you home if you're that close.  70s, definitely a very good decade.  In general.  I heard one, they pull the keys out and the cop threw it, not far, but kind of off the 
[02:35:30]  road into the grass and goes, just go to sleep.  He goes, you'll find that when it gets light out.  You'll find your keys.  And just left them there to sleep.  They used to also just take your keys and come back in a few hours.  They should come back.  Oh, yeah.  What the hell were they thinking?  They worked with drunk driving.  Deaths were up like ridiculously high.  You couldn't get hurt in those cars.  Those things were huge.  That's where Global Warming started.  All those drunk drivers slamming into all those trees. 
[02:36:00]  Those huge cars.  You ever see those films in school?  The hamburger on the highway films?  They were all those big, heavy vehicles that didn't have the crumple zones and all the  technology that we have now.  Also, you just got the steering columns used to go directly from the like pinion box on  the wheel to the steering wheel.  So it was an amount.  It amounted to like a fucking javelin that was your steering wheel was on the tip of a  javelin that whatever you hit, it would just go right through your chest. 
[02:36:30]  And I saw pictures of this one guy who was in a pickup truck and he was slumped over the  wheel.  The steering wheel was bent like a dome.  Right.  It had bent down and it was in his chest.  It was just like it was impaled on the steering column.  Was he dead?  Fuck yeah.  Gone.  Just completely fucking dead.  They were horrible cars, those old ones.  I remember being in the passenger seat, no seatbelt, my father driving, and a fucking 
[02:37:00]  metal dashboard, not covered with any kind of foam.  You knocked on it.  It was metal.  And no seatbelt.  So when he jammed on the brakes, he put his magic dad arm up that, you know, is good for  point one mile per hour.  Anything over that.  And you're just flying into the dashboard.  Yeah, that's good if you run over a gum wrapper.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The dad arm out.  Anything else, you're fucking paralyzed.  The dad arm is not going to protect you.  Breaking his arm in the process, too. 
[02:37:30]  Exactly.  So your chest, your teeth, and his arm all shattered.  And his arm all busted.  Hey, I don't want to miss this moment.  Matt in Melrose, he writes, speaking of no security, there's a saucy picture of my dad  in the Globe, Boston Globe, of him tackling Robert Parrish right on the court after the  Celtics won a playoff game in the 80s.  Wow.  And I was tackling him, huh?  Just tackling him.  You would be beaten to a pulp, taken to jail, and you'd be really in trouble.  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  The horses would come out.  What's that one where Chris Shambliss hits that walk-off home run?  Playoff game against the Royals.  Yeah.  He could barely touch all the bases, right?  Yeah, he could barely.  I remember another one, Reggie Jackson trying to zigzag into the dugout, lowering his shoulder.  Oh, yeah, driving into some people.  Some accountant just gets drilled into the on-deck circle.  With a famous Bobby Thompson.  The Giants win the pennant!  The Giants win the pennant!  I think it was Bobby Thompson, right?  He gets to the third base, and they all mob him, and everybody's having fun.  They're like Hank Aaron trying to run around with his fucking awful, fat, suburban guy gut 
[02:38:30]  after hitting that home run.  Remember Hank Aaron?  The fucking guy's running with him.  Matt in North Carolina.  North Carolina loves this radio show.  We've got to go down there.  As they should.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  All right.  Listen, back when I was in Cub Scouts, I was probably 12 years old, the local cop.  Come from a town of about 1,200.  We go out to the country, and he goes, yes, you know, he was the Cub Scout leader, but 
[02:39:00]  he was also the local sheriff.  He said, you know, we go outside, and he goes, well, let me shoot your gun.  So he's sitting out there, and we're shooting at fish in this river.  So you're shooting the cop's gun?  Yeah.  He was just, I mean, he was just like an old, fat bastard.  See, those were the days they didn't even have to count the bullets.  Now you fire off your gun, and there's lots of paperwork.  Back then, it's like, yeah, yeah, why don't you shoot my gun a few times?  Good old 70s.  I'm telling you, we're on to a bit here.  The good old 70s.  Hey, you let him shoot his gun. 
[02:39:30]  Thank you, Matt.  Nothing mattered.  Yeah.  It really did.  You caught the clap, you high-fived someone, you washed your dick off, and you kept going.  Fucking men were men.  Fucking.  You didn't even go get treatment for the clap.  You just fucking bled it out like a man.  Grab that fucking porcelain until it's wheezed itself through your system.  Let's go to Tom in Philly.  Tom.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  We were drinking.  It was like 1979, 1980.  Cruising around, drinking in the snow.  Volkswagen Beetle.  I hit an embankment, flipped over. 
[02:40:00]  Beer cans came out, flipped the car back over, cranked it, took off.  Cop pulled us over, nailed us for littering.  $200 fine.  You got littering from the beer cans that fell out of the car?  Yep.  Oh, that's great.  The good old 70s.  Let's say hi to Dave on Long Island.  Dave.  In 1978, I had my first car was a 58 Chevy.  I drunk drove into a telephone pole, and all I did was bent a fender in the bumper.  Let's go to Jay in Newark. 
[02:40:30]  Jay.  Guys, back in the 70s, Washington Square Park was the biggest party place.  You go there on the weekend, it would be filled with people, guys walking around with bags,  huge bags of weed right out in the open.  You could get anything you wanted.  You didn't even worry about cops or anything.  It was like right in the open.  You did whatever you wanted.  You got acid, anything.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah, they'd come up and ask you, you know.  Right when you pass by them real slow, they'd be like, you know, weed, weed, weed, weed. 
[02:41:00]  Mary Jane.  Weed.  Mary Jane.  Mask, mask, mask, mask.  You know how they do it now when you walk by?  They go, you all right?  You all right?  Really?  Yeah, they say, you all right?  How do you know this?  Because I walk by Washington Square all the time.  Yeah, but don't you think?  I would just think people are concerned about how I feel.  How do you answer that, Jimmy?  No, I'm not all right.  I'm fine.  Thank you.  My foot hurts.  Okay.  They'll say, what's up, man?  And I'll say, what's up?  It's a courtesy.  I'll say, hey.  And they'll go, you all right?  And they'll go, yeah, I'm fine. 
[02:41:30]  I go, I'm all right.  Yes, I'm all right.  You have to let them know you're being courteous, but you're not fucking saying you're all right  because you want drugs.  I'm, what if you say, ah.  Street survival.  101.  101.  Yeah.  I don't know how you learned that.  I had a scary thing one time.  I was walking by Washington Square, and there was some undercover narcos doing something.  And there was a couple guys they were looking at, and I happened to walk up with these guys  along McDougal, and fucking these undercovers pulled over like a van, and they grabbed me  with these two guys.  And this one cop, he's every fucking bad cop, every frightening cop, shut the fuck up and 
[02:42:00]  get up against the fucking van.  And the one guy tried to smart mouth him, and oh, was he a fight?  He grabbed his back and pushed him up against the guy.  You want to go to fucking jail, asshole?  I'm a cop, you idiot.  And I was like, I was like, be very polite.  And he's like, what are you doing?  Or what the fuck are you?  He was really nasty.  I'm like, oh, I'm a comedian.  I'm just going to the comedy show to do a spot.  And he's like, oh, okay, you can go.  But the other guy tried to get smart with him. 
[02:42:30]  Like, what, did I do something, officer?  He's one of those voices, too.  Oh, you don't do that.  You can't sass some shithead.  This is a fucking sitcom you're watching.  It's almost as bad as saying, I know my rights.  Yeah, they never want to hear that.  I know my rights.  And your rights will be available to you in court.  Right now, this is my fucking show.  I can do whatever I please to you.  The judge is going to believe me.  Yeah.  No matter what happens, I'll look around.  Any video?  I don't see any.  So I'll pummel you a little bit. 
[02:43:00]  We'll take you down to the station house where we have a room with no cameras where we can  really get in there and fuck you up.  Have some fun.  A lot of phone calls coming in.  We got Ron in Montana.  Ron, what's up?  Hey.  I wanted to tell you about our driver's ed instructor.  Okay.  He was a great guy.  We used to drive over the big hole because he liked to fish like crazy.  He would drink beer the entire time.  Well, I'm losing you. 
[02:43:30]  No, you're not losing us.  We're stupefied at this point.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Mark in South Carolina.  Hey, guys.  You rock.  Hey, we had an eighth grade history.  We're talking about the Revolutionary War.  Our teacher brought a .50 caliber musket into the classroom, and to show us what it was  like, he took it outside the classroom, let every one of us shoot a .50 caliber musket. 
[02:44:00]  You don't see that happening anymore.  No, no.  Oh, no, no.  But that was the coolest thing.  I mean, there's a bunch of little kids, the guns longer than they are, you know, blowing  their arms out, making smoke.  It was awful.  I loved it.  There used to be shooting classes in high school.  Like, high school students could shoot, and you would bring, believe me, this is before  my day, but the guy at the gun store was telling me this, and you would see students 
[02:44:30]  on the subway with rifle cases, just on the subway, and they were going to shooting class,  and like, it was nothing to see high school kids with rifles in the subway.  Could you imagine walking in the subway with a rifle now?  It just ain't ever going to happen without you just being shot.  Yeah, but nobody ever did anything either, right?  No.  Is anyone else?  No, there wasn't.  No one.  I doubt there was one shooting from these kids.  They were just going to school. 
[02:45:00]  It was like going with your pencils, except you go with the gun.  Is anyone else disturbed by Kenny's earmuffs?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Yeah, I was a little disturbed earlier by them.  Put your earmuffs back on.  He's 6'5", and he's wearing earmuffs.  Look at this, Mike.  I'm cold.  He's listening to his iPod.  No, his fucking little walkman.  WDMV.  There's just something creepy about a 6'5 guy wearing earmuffs. 
[02:45:30]  Earmuffs.  I'd need to keep my ears warm.  Kenny, why not a hat?  No?  You don't do the hat?  No.  Anybody can wear a hat.  I understand.  He's so big that his heart can't pump the blood up to his ears, so they get cold.  You know, he has a big thoroughbred heart.  Oh, for sure.  Secretariat.  They're going to weigh that thing when he dies someday. 
[02:46:00]  It's more powerful than your Prius engine.  Yeah.  Oh, exactly.  Put his heart under the hood.  Let's go to Darren in North Carolina.  Darren.  Yes, guys.  I have a story.  Back in about 93, a buddy and I had been drinking.  Decided that we needed to leave.  So we headed out.  We get about a couple miles up the road to get a patch of ice.  My Jeep spins around.  So we're pointed back in the direction we came from.  Don't really realize it.  Get up the road about a mile.  Officer pulls us over. 
[02:46:30]  I can't really communicate with him.  So my buddy just tells him, yeah, we're headed back to the apartment.  He says, okay, get your asses there safely.  I wake up the next morning laying in a puddle of vomit.  My Jeep's still running.  All the doors open.  The 70s.  I was distracted because we're having a phone problem.  Yeah.  We had a phone problem last week.  There's still a phone problem today.  So I don't know.  Why don't we take a break?  What's wrong with the phones? 
[02:47:00]  It makes that feedback-y sound.  Something's turned up.  Yeah.  All right.  Bill Burr in studio.  He's doing Letterman on Friday night.  It's Opie and Anthony.  There is a new element of vulgarity.  Opie and Anthony.  It's outrageous.  Fuck you.  Move.  Anna.  Fuck you.  Damages our children.  Go fuck yourself.  And diminishes their future.  Oodle.  Oodle.  This is a tragedy for the society.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:47:30]  Thanks for checking us out today.  We appreciate it.  On a Monday.  Yuck.  Let's go to Buffalo.  It's Jeff.  What's up, Jeff?  Yeah.  Am I on?  Yeah.  I think so.  I got a story from back in the 70s.  I live out in Chitawaga next to Buffalo, New York.  Opie probably knows where it is.  Back in about 73, I was rolling down Union Road.  I was dropping. 
[02:48:00]  I saw something behind me.  I was face-to-face.  I couldn't even see it straight.  And I just didn't want to pull over because I didn't really feel like getting in trouble.  But about four miles down the road, a Chitawaga police officer pulled his car right in front of me.  I damn near hit him.  Wales are beaching themselves all over the world because of this phone call.  Sorry about your call, dude.  We're not fucking with you.  We're very frustrated because our phones are not working.  Our phones suck.  Can we get Mars in here?  We said that an hour ago.  We asked for this 20 minutes ago.  We should really tear down a wall. 
[02:48:30]  We're ready to completely lose our minds.  It's one little thing after another.  It's driving us nuts today.  The phones started messing up last week.  Why aren't they fixed yet?  Sorry, Jeff, but it's too distracting to go to the phones.  We don't need phones.  We only have every line lit, and they have good stories about what we're talking about today.  But don't worry about that.  We're such great broadcasters.  We'll have to do a show without the phones.  Thank you, Washington.  Thank you, Don Wicklin.  Thank you.  Is Mars in today? 
[02:49:00]  Carolina's got good stories, too.  Yeah.  Third grade teacher chewed tobacco in class.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jason.  Let's see if this will work.  Jason, Carolina, what's up?  Hey, man, my third grade teacher used to chew chewing tobacco during class.  He'd read us stories and spit.  It was great.  Yeah, see, the 70s.  Yeah, go ahead.  Can I give a shout-out to him in case he's still alive?  Yeah, well, if he was chewing tobacco in the 70s.  Yeah, Mr. Brannon in Arizona, Tumbleweed Elementary, you rock. 
[02:49:30]  All right, you rock.  Yes, he did.  He's probably dead.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry, Texas, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, right.  Back in 1978, we was leaving the lake.  Police pulled my mom and her friend over, told us to get off the side of the trails in the truck and lay down in the back.  Air mattresses were back there.  My mom took two of us, put us in the front.  After the police pulled us over, we left, hit the interstate. 
[02:50:00]  Air turbulence got up underneath the mattress and threw three kids out of the back of the truck.  They die?  Two of them did.  Jesus.  And then what did the cops say?  Funny story.  All right.  Pick up those dead kids and get yourself home.  Get home.  Don't worry about it.  I don't want to do the paperwork.  Why would you share such a horrific story like that?  Because it was great.  I didn't like one of them.  Wow.  Damn.  We used to get loaded in the back of a pickup truck when I lived out in California there. 
[02:50:30]  My father.  When you were six.  No, no.  A little older than that.  When I was six or so, my father, he rode motorcycles.  And he'd just pop me on top of the gas tank.  And I'd ride around like that.  Nice.  And if anything ever happened, I'd be so dead.  But the pickup trucks are great.  All the kids would just be loaded into the back of a pickup truck.  And just go down the freeway.  Sure.  Why not?  You know, you're doing 65, 70 miles an hour. 
[02:51:00]  There's seat belt.  What?  You don't even have to crash.  When the brake got hit a little too hard, all the kids would smash up against the front  side of the bed.  And then when the gas got hit too hard, you'd all slide down and hit the tailgate that could  just open.  I remember the tailgate also, yeah, on a few bumps, the tailgate would just open up.  Like, ah, the tailgate's open.  We had a dog jump out on the freeway.  Dead?  No, it rolled really a lot and cut himself up. 
[02:51:30]  It's the 70s.  And then just ran over to the side of the road.  That's what I'm trying to get out of there.  And kind of just sat there.  And, you know, hey, blue, blue dog, come here.  And got back in the back of the truck.  That's what you called it?  Or that's what you did?  Is that a blue dog?  So you made him feel all better with his skin.  Yeah, he was hurting.  We want to take his mind off of it.  Give me that pink lipstick.  I'll show you.  Come on.  Oh, God.  Mark in Canada.  Here's what happens when you suck a dog's dick.  Okay.  At first, he's like.  He doesn't like it.  And all of a sudden, he goes. 
[02:52:00]  Mark in Canada.  He settles in a little.  Mark, what's up?  Our high school still operates a gun range within the school.  Really?  Yeah, .22 caliber for local Army and Air Cadets.  But it's Canada.  You're not allowed to have, like, guns.  Yeah, right?  You're only allowed to have health care.  Yeah, well, they're those N-fields that N-fields that N-fields love so much.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, this is a good story in the paper that Bill reminded us of.  The tranny? 
[02:52:30]  That was, what, stabbed to death?  Yeah.  Mistaken identity?  Oh, no.  Well, what is this?  Nesha was just one of the girls.  What paper, buddy?  Well, we got Daily News, page 20.  Nesha.  Sinesha Stewart was not your everyday sight in the Bronx, a six-foot man in high heels  and lipstick, but was accepted as family by those around the victim, loved ones said  yesterday.  So they were shocked to learn that their 25-year-old transgender neighbor was stabbed to death Saturday 
[02:53:00]  by an ex-con who told cops he flew into a rage when he found out his date was not a  woman.  Wow, she was passing.  Oh, you think she is?  No, I'm saying, if he didn't know.  Well, Nesha was a friend of the whole building, a really nice person who didn't deserve that.  I called him her out of respect.  Police responded to her dispute.  She was stabbed several times.  They arrested Steve McMillan, who was still inside Stewart's apartment.  He was waiting to be arraigned on murder charges late last night. 
[02:53:30]  Police sources said McMillan was a John who flew into a rage after discovering Stewart,  a prostitute, was not a woman.  So does this guy get off or what?  No.  Why not?  You can't commit a murder because somebody fucking has a dick.  What about the psychological trauma?  Yeah.  What?  He went insane when he saw a cock when he was...  Shanisha was...  Yeah.  It was Sean. 
[02:54:00]  She had breast implants and other plastic surgery to look more like a woman.  False advertising right there, I think.  Right?  False advertising, you can get away with it.  Yeah, you go to the business bureau, but there's no reason to joke on that.  A lot of people saying that it was very obvious, like, when she turned around, that it was a  man.  Oh, yeah.  Dressed like a woman.  Those booty shorts and the ball sack hanging on the side.  Right.  Exactly.  Dead giveaway.  Hi, daddy.  Big pool of blood on the floor and all over the bed.  Oh, the caked makeup over the whiskers? 
[02:54:30]  No matter how close you shave, you just can still see it?  Yeah, the whiskers.  For God's sake, you can't cover those up.  Transgenders have been wearing that HDTV makeup since forever.  That Conan O'Brien just caked on.  Pink spackle.  So that happened.  And then some S&M club here.  New York.  There was a story over the weekend.  You read that one?  Yeah.  The guy almost died.  Well, he's going to be brain damaged. 
[02:55:00]  He's going to have brain damage.  What did he do?  Went to an S&M club.  He's a regular.  And they pretty much hung him up.  His feet were kind of touching the ground.  I guess he was handcuffed.  He had high heels on.  What else?  I don't know how he was suspended.  Some kind of hood or something.  And he was suspended.  What if his high heels broke or something like that?  Oh, really?  And his feet?  She came to check it out in 20 minutes.  Right.  And he was blue in the face.  Hanging by the neck.  I don't know. 
[02:55:30]  Was he hanging by the neck?  Do not know.  Do we have that story?  Yeah, that was a biggie over the weekend.  And I learned something.  That S&M clubs are pretty much legal.  Jimmy, you know anything about that?  Why?  Because it's not sexual?  It's not sexual.  Sure you can.  They're totally legal.  So this guy would go in there and he would hang for hours in these dungeons and stuff.  Yeah, he liked to be hung.  That is like the exact opposite of like claustrophobia.  Yeah.  Like how you could actually hang.  I would be freaking the fuck out.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:56:00]  I'd be like, there's no way.  Put a goddamn hood over my head.  Yeah.  Then handcuff me to a radiator.  You know how do you fucking mind that?  These guys love modification.  There's guys that love to be smothered.  Well, they'll put them on the table and they'll like saran wrap their entire body with their  hands down, including their face.  Oh, my God.  Put little breathing holes.  Yeah, like a straw or something.  The mistress will smother you with her ass and then pull off and let you breathe.  You really could die.  Wow, that's fucked.  Breath play, they call it.  You ever see the thing where they put you in it? 
[02:56:30]  It's like a plastic sandwich and then they suck the air out and you're encased in plastic.  And then there's something that goes in your mouth to breathe, but you're completely encased  in plastic.  Can you imagine if somebody was into that, what do you call it, breath play, was actually  involved in an earthquake and the whole house collapses and they're trying to rescue him.  He's in there.  No, it's okay.  I'm loving it.  I'm all right.  This is the ultimate fantasy.  Leave me alone. 
[02:57:00]  I'm all right.  Yeah, he's covered with bricks, but he has an erection.  We don't get it.  Okay, here you go.  So, unidentified patron of a Midtown S&M club, he was bounded and suspended from a  ceiling while wearing women's high heels and a neck choker.  He was hospitalized in critical condition Friday.  Like the gimp, probably.  While an accident is the most likely cause, police say they're investigating whether he  was the victim of a crime.  Why is he, by the way, unnamed?  Because he would go to the club without ID or anything.  They're trying to figure out who he is. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, he is.  He was a regular.  They knew him, but they didn't know his real name or anything.  He just kind of showed up with, I forgot what they said, like just money in his pocket.  God, I hope it's a comic that I know.  Heath Robinson was for him.  The man was found at 130 inside the East 33rd Street Club known as Nutcracker Suite.  The Nutcracker Suite.  An artistic innovation, wearing his pants but not carrying any identification, police  said.  He's listening to critical condition. 
[02:58:00]  He was discovered in apparent respiratory distress after a club worker checked on him  as he was suspended from the ceiling and noticed that his hands looked blue.  And they didn't arrest her, the mistress that was in charge of this whole scene.  She's, uh, why wouldn't they arrest her, Jimmy?  They might get her for some kind of gross negligence, but it's not a crime.  He volunteered for it.  He wanted it.  Um, but it'd be manslaughter, I think, if he dies.  It's not, again, some kind of gross negligence.  I don't know why, but it's not illegal.  It's sexual activity.  You're probably jerking off in many cases, but you're not fucking. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  Unfortunately, they don't fuck you.  So how, so you're hanging from a collar, basically, or like, but you're, like, but your  toes are touching the floor.  How is that sexual?  I don't get it.  How does that help you out?  It certainly is, but I don't understand it.  I don't know, like, when you wrap yourself in plastic and you got breathing holes, how  is that sexual?  Like, I don't, I don't understand that.  If it's a connection to being a sexual thing.  I do, I, you got me.  I mean, I just don't understand it.  Yeah, some people.  I was always jerking off. 
[02:59:00]  Huh?  I was always jerking off all stuff.  If they were facing me or pissing in my mouth, I was always jerking off.  I was.  Sad to say that actually really, I don't know, as creepy as some of that shit that you're  into, I guess it makes sense on some level.  But as far as like that, just being tied up, having somebody stick like a dish rag in  your mouth, turns you on in a sexual way, right?  I don't comprehend it.  We're going to have to get someone to explain that.  I wonder if it has something to do with being a baby. 
[02:59:30]  I was watching something interesting on Lost where they were, you know, John Locke, who  knows everything, was just covering the baby.  But he tightened the blanket around the baby.  He said only when they get older do they like to not be restricted.  But when they're very young, they like to be restricted.  Like it makes them feel comforted, like in the womb or whatever.  So I wonder if it goes back to that.  It has something to do with that, I'm imagining.  Like you feel somehow weirdly comforted.  Like I know you're getting your info from Lost.  That's nice.  Well, I mean, I also know that it's a big fetish.  It has to represent something. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  I don't know what.  That could be something like.  I mean, why do I, why do I drank piss?  Was I thirsty?  Drank piss?  No.  Yeah, what's that?  Why did I drank piss?  Yes, I don't know.  A drink.  Why did I drink?  I drank it.  Past tense of the verb to drink.  Why did I gargle with piss like it was Lavoris?  Because of that.  Wasn't there some girl, like when you were younger, you told me a story about some girl  and she smelled pissy. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A guy and his sister actually, the boy and the girl.  I was very young.  I was like second grade.  I'd get them both to sit on my face separately in their jeans.  And I would just smell their crotches because they always piss their pants.  In second grade?  Yeah, maybe first.  I fucking love that.  It's true.  What a sick little story.  I was going to say, when were you ever just not this little pervert running around?  You were just like walking around.  Seven or eight.  Getting to school in a bathrobe when they still thought it was cute.  He's got a big heart on under it.  Oh, look.  He's like Rodney.  He's walking around Dangerfields. 
[03:01:00]  A little kid with a Cialis heart on it in his robe.  Let's go to Vegas.  It's Ron.  Ron.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  You're all over here, man.  You've got to have a sex talk show, I think.  I want to know what's sexy about the logs dropping on your chest.  Oh, I wouldn't know.  I imagine you wanted to do that yourself while you're jerking off.  And after you come and you're wiping them off, you go, what was sexy about that?  300, madam.  All right.  And Richard, Wisconsin.  Can I say, I think there's a certain sexuality with a woman that seems disgusting, let's just 
[03:01:30]  say.  Golden shower, whatever.  Brown showers.  Any of that stuff that people are into.  I think part of it is the privacy of it all.  You're seeing something so taboo.  And it is such an intense.  It's oddly intimate and intense, as gross as it sounds.  But there was one mistress I used to do golden shower with.  And this motherfucker was sexy.  She just, dude, she just got it. 
[03:02:00]  She would put a pussy right over my mouth.  And she would, it would be right over my mouth.  Dude, she was immaculately clean.  And she would just go open.  And I would open and she would fill my mouth and she would go swallow.  She was so fucking sexy.  Oh my God.  That is fucking nasty.  Oh God.  It's nasty if you're not into that.  Wow, there you go.  What would you rather have?  Would you rather have choice?  You're going to have that horror?  I love how Jim tries to like.  But there's a lot of people out there right now.  I know what you mean.  He tries to convince us how sexy it is. 
[03:02:30]  And we all look around the room like.  So sexy.  And then she would swallow.  So sexy.  Be still.  And then she'd just take a dump right on my chest.  It was so sexy.  Oh, it was great.  No, be still is hack.  She knows better than that.  She would say open.  It was so fucking sexy.  Because I've said that to girls.  I like saying that to girls.  And then she took a meat thermometer and shoved it in my asshole.  And just went deeper, deeper.  No, no, no.  And I went good, good.  It was just this sexy.  He's filling it up right now as he's talking about it.  And twist it around three times.  Just three times.  Yes.  And then unsnap it. 
[03:03:00]  And it would just have that little slow funny scrotum unwind.  No.  Slow funny, huh?  I'm really dominant sexually.  Like I'm not a sub at all.  Well, that's pretty sub when she's telling you what the fuck to do with her piss in your mouth.  Dominate.  Yeah, and I wanted to do it.  She was dominating in a way.  It was from the neck up, man.  That's what it's all about.  She was fucking her vibe.  Do you understand?  That was the beauty of her.  No, I don't.  No.  We're trying to understand.  There is no way I can understand a girl pissing in my mouth.  Do you ever want to have somebody wrap you up in cellophane just so you can hear that urinating sound as it hits the... 
[03:03:30]  No, I can't comprehend that.  The aluminum foil.  Why have something in the way?  Right, Jimmy?  Right, exactly.  Cellophane.  What am I, wasteful?  What am I, what is this, waste nut, what nut?  What do you think, he's a rookie?  I'll fuck it, I'll put my mouth anywhere on a girl.  Anywhere.  But as far as piss goes, that's not...  Piss is fucking clean, man.  Go to the bathroom, take your piss, come out.  It's clean.  And I'll go right in there. 
[03:04:00]  But don't piss while you're doing it.  I don't comprehend anima stuff.  I don't comprehend blood.  Like fucking, they call them ruby showers.  I don't comprehend fucking...  What do you find, an ulcerated fucking prostitute?  She started off on Wall Street, she couldn't handle it, so now she's blowing people.  There are guys...  Wait, wait, Jimmy, you can't just casually say ruby shower.  I don't...  That's a tampon.  She sucked a tampon or she puts her blood in the middle.  I don't get it.  I can't...  To me, that's...  But that's a ruby shower?  Yeah, repugnant. 
[03:04:30]  I've never involved in that.  Well, Roman showers are very popular where a girl pukes in your mouth.  That's...  I couldn't ever do that under any circumstance.  Oh, ruby shower.  He knows all the lingo and blurts it out like, nah, it's a ruby shower.  Like everyone knows.  Ruby, ruby, ruby.  Hey, man, as long as you're not fucking animals or kids, whatever.  Do what you want.  Kid animals.  All right.  I wouldn't mind.  I almost get hit with a strap on one time.  I was tempted, but...  Really?  Yeah, she was one of the fucking sexiest people ever.  She was a dirty, dirty motherfucker, man. 
[03:05:00]  She would do all fetish stuff.  She would put a pussy in my mouth and go, no, swallow your wife's piss.  She'd piss in my mouth.  And then she'd fuck me.  She was like a weird type of dom where she did full service.  It's very, very rare for them.  Swallow your wife's piss.  She fucking ruled.  At a girl.  At a girl.  All right, well...  Okay, Jimmy Norton.  Ladies and gentlemen, good to be at the Borgata.  I'll be in San Francisco this weekend. 
[03:05:30]  That's all normal in Sanny Franny.  There you go, Con.  Sanny Franny.  Sanny Franny.  Let's go to Connecticut.  Let's see what Michael has today.  Michael, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Hey, Jimmy.  I was just thinking back to when you were all freaked out about Earl's chewed up pen.  Then you'll drink fucking hot hooker piss.  I really don't get the fucking connection.  It's obvious right now.  Here's another pen with tooth marks in it.  Oh, boy.  That's good.  I fucking specifically said, I don't want a pen with tooth marks in it. 
[03:06:00]  Here it goes.  And here's what we do with the pen with tooth marks in it.  You see that, Bill?  Oh, no.  No, I don't see it, actually.  That's where it goes.  And now we put it back in the pen pile.  So can I go back in the pen pile, please?  If Earl wants to chew pens, let him chew that one.  Oh, my God.  It's so gross.  He sticks the pen up his ass.  Yeah, but that's the good sign.  I promise.  Put that back.  He wants to chew pens.  Let him chew that one.  If you could bring me an unschewed one, please.  And, yes, sir, chewing pens, if it's your own pen, it's fine, but it's being shared. 
[03:06:30]  It's disgusting.  And, yes, I realize it's a bit inconsistent with my thinking.  All right.  There you go.  There's your answer.  Chris in D.C., what's up?  Hey, Air Force Survival School.  When we teach the pilots whenever they're out in bad conditions, if they're injured and  there's no other way to do it, urine is very sterile.  It is, of course.  And if they have wounds that they need to rest, they should urinate in those wounds in order  to clean them.  Absolutely, dude.  It doesn't say rub hot pussy juice on it. 
[03:07:00]  It's just fucking take a piss in it.  That's available, of course.  Hey, real quick throwback to the John McCain thing.  Do you guys know that he was initially offered at five months into his incarceration as a  POW, he was offered to be released because of his father's status as an admiral in the  military, and he declined it.  Really?  And stayed for the entire six years because there were other guys there that had been  there longer than he was, and that's your story.  Wait, why would the Vietnamese have released him because his father was an admiral? 
[03:07:30]  Exactly.  That is exactly why.  Out of respect for his military family and because of how high-ranking his father was  in the U.S. military, they had offered him a release, but he declined it because there  were other POWs that had been there longer than he was.  Well, do you think that the U.S. military...  He could have been gone in five months.  I'm sorry.  Do you think the U.S. military tried to cut a secret deal because of his father's power?  Maybe.  Like something that we don't negotiate, but they were negotiating, and then maybe he said,  no, I can't do it like that?  Yeah, maybe.  I wonder.  No, but he turned it down.  That's the point. 
[03:08:00]  And it's in his book.  It's all documented.  But more importantly, did he ever drink piss?  I'd love to talk with Johnny M.  Johnny M.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Jim.  Yes.  Jimbo.  I'm right here.  What does it taste like, Jim?  Popcorn.  You stink.  Popcorn.  It tastes like popcorn.  Truth.  It tastes like popcorn.  It really does, man.  It can be very salty.  If it's really salty, I don't like it.  I like it when it's more clear with a tinge of salt. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, God.  It's just making me cringe thinking about it.  It's filthy.  Urine is not clean.  It is.  It's hygienic.  I'm telling you, Bill.  Trust me.  I'll try to drink my own.  Because now I need to know.  Here's what you do.  You want to break yourself into it.  You're the girl.  You tell her, look.  Just don't wipe it off when you're done.  What if she has, like, chlamydia or something like that?  Well, that's different.  You're going to get this.  What does that taste like, Jim?  Guacamole?  I think chlamydia is a bad example.  Jim is disgusting.  Stop trying to make it mainstream.  It's horrific.  It's very topical. 
[03:09:00]  You can, you know, if you get a scratch on your knee, I mean, you know, why have a band-aid  when you just whip your dick out and just let it run right down your leg?  What if she discharges marshmallows?  What does it taste like?  I don't know.  Cocoa?  Any type of venereal disease is a problem.  That's a problem if you're just eating a pussy.  I'll bet you if you're eating a pussy and she has chlamydia, it'll have more of a disgusting  taste than if she pisses with chlamydia.  Absolutely, which is why you don't go to prostitutes.  Well, I'm regular girls, man.  I've had regular girls whiz in my mouth.  And a dominatrix is not a prostitute. 
[03:09:30]  There are actually, there's a lot of them.  But you said that girl actually fucked, too.  Oh, two different girls.  One did, yeah.  I'm talking about the one who fucked, too, Jimmy.  Okay, yeah, she was great.  I'm saying her urine was not clean.  I'm saying it was horrific.  Unclean urine.  She'd spit in my mouth and everything, so if her piss wasn't clean, the rest of her best  It probably tastes like a Dr. Pepper.  But, dude, she was clean.  I never caught a V.  I've never had a venereal disease in my life.  I just got tested again.  Never have I had anything.  You know what, Jim?  Jim is like the reverse of, you know, those high school films where the person, the girl  has sex for the first time and it's unprotected and she gets, you know, AIDS or HIV. 
[03:10:00]  He's like the exact opposite.  I fucking have hookers piss in my mouth.  He doesn't get anything.  He's invincible.  No, I'm not.  I've actually been more careful than people think.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, man.  Hookers pissing on you.  In my mouth.  Slices the bottom of his feet and just runs through a third world village.  Doesn't get anything.  He's fucking a hole in the ground in Calcutta.  What's wrong with this kid?  African gentlemen jerk off on open wounds.  Gino from Philly. 
[03:10:30]  Actually, sperm is, African sperm is very clean.  Yes, yes, very hygienic.  Gino from Philly writes, I heard herpes taste like tater tots.  And Bill Kaye from Philly.  Hey, no, the reason they would have offered to release McCain was for propaganda reasons.  The gooks, he writes this, wanted to use it as an example to other U.S. soldiers that they  should not fight for country where one soldier gets preferential treatment.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah, the whole time he was there, they were trying to coerce him to go on camera or something 
[03:11:00]  or sign something that said he was like an air pirate or something like that.  Arr.  Yeah.  Something like that.  All right.  And let's say hi to Josh.  Those balls cost him five years of his life.  Go on TV and make this statement.  Then when you're back in America, just go, ah, that was bullshit.  Everybody knows it's bullshit.  Nobody believes a hostage is being genuine.  Oh, I guess the Americans are imperialist pigs.  He said it with the gun at them.  I know.  With all his broken arms and legs and ribs. 
[03:11:30]  As he's blinking, help me.  Morse code.  Yeah, very believable.  Yeah, I know.  You really wouldn't have to coerce any sort of confession.  You get me to say anything.  Just don't break my arms again.  Sure.  Josh in Minnesota.  Josh.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, we're going to come see you up in Minneapolis next month.  We're all going to piss in a squirt bottle so if you get sweaty on stage, you can drink  some piss to cool yourself down.  Atta boy.  Some piss-sicles.  That show's almost sold out, sweetie, so get your tickets.  Awesome.  Oh, we did.  We got front row tickets. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, good.  Enjoy the show.  A couple other things here.  We got a bride that died during the first dance.  Wow.  Is that bad or did that just save him a lot of trouble?  Oh, God.  Happened in Florida.  How old was she?  Kim, last name, looks like Greek name.  Kim, blah, blah, blah, blah, wanted a real-life version of the film My Big Fat Greek Wedding,  which played in the background as friends fixed her hair and makeup before her own marriage  ceremony.  Wow. 
[03:12:30]  Started off good.  But less than an hour after she and Teddy...  My Big Fat Greek Heart Attack?  Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, God.  Teddy F.  Carb...  We're wed.  Kim crumbled in her husband's arms during a Greek song that means love me.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  At 36, Kim was dead from...  From?  From.  From?  Cardiac arrest.  Heart disease.  Oh, okay.  I, uh...  What was that?  Wow. 
[03:13:00]  Yes.  Too bad Jackie Mason wasn't there.  If he was there, it would have been wonderful.  We don't know.  Is it a funeral?  Is it a wedding?  We don't know.  She's grabbing, she's dancing, she's falling, grabbing her chest.  Good impression, Jim.  Is this there?  Lower, please.  Yeah, exactly.  Jesus, who's listening to us?  Dogs?  Cut.  Here they are, the first time as husband and wife.  Falling in love.  Aw, adorable. 
[03:13:30]  Please welcome Mr. and Mrs.  Great name.  Daddy's little expense.  Oh, God.  Hey, uh, this gets better if you want to play along here.  So, Kim, she carried blue and white flowers during the ceremony.  the colors of the Greek flag, as she exchanged vows with her husband there, 
[03:14:00]  a 43-year-old carpenter and Navy veteran.  They had met three years to the day before the January 19th wedding.  During the couple's first dance, Kim complained of being lightheaded.  The husband there thought his wife, a diabetic, needed sugar, but she collapsed.  Take my whole life, for I can't tell, falling in love with you, my brother's love. 
[03:14:30]  Sniper from Whackbag writes,  So is there a wedding song, Cutting Crew, I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight? 
[03:15:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  All right, well.  It would be funny if the groom was one of those guys who just didn't know how to get out of a relationship.  He's just sitting there going, God, how the hell am I going to, I can't believe I'm going through with this.  Yeah, why am I getting married?  And he did.  Fell out of love with her three years ago when I first met her.  Should have been a one-night stand.  I only did this because her parents pressured me into this.  You know what if they stood to the chicken dance afterwards?  Like, as they're fucking toe-tagging her in the middle of the fucking... 
[03:15:30]  Come on, people, we paid for a DJ.  Let's try to make the best of this.  Yeah, let's make the best of it.  Anybody got any requests?  We got an extra entree.  Anybody else want seconds?  Don't let that distract you.  We're going to have the bride's friend rub cake in his face.  Oh, my God.  Well, you want to know how he consoles himself?  He consoles himself by reading a list of 101 reasons why I love you that Kim gave him their first Christmas together. 
[03:16:00]  I probably shouldn't read that.  Number one, you make me smile.  Number 98 is especially difficult.  It reads, you're the one I want to grow old with.  Oh.  Oh.  Number 99 was really depressing.  You're a great dancer.  Number 100 sucked.  You make my heart feel strong.  Oh, God.  Number 101 really was awful.  You always know what to do when I'm feeling lightheaded.  Instead of calling the ambulance, you hand me a fucking Snickers bar. 
[03:16:30]  That's awful.  Thanks, really.  At least I won't be hungry as I hit the floor.  All those recents.  You know how to combine events.  That was reading number 51.  So he did the whole wedding slash wake.  You're a real fucking multitasker.  That's what I love about you.  Let's say hi to Michael in Houston.  Michael?  Hey, man.  I heard that during the first dance, he said, honey, have you ever heard of an F5? 
[03:17:00]  Ooh, linger longer.  Very good, sir.  Let's go to John in North Carolina.  A lot of North Carolina calls today.  Really amazing.  What's up, John?  Hey, guys.  Hey, it would be real easy.  They can just take all the flowers from the wedding and drag them over to the funeral.  Absolutely.  Just go to Yahoo Maps.  Fucking maps.  We got where to take it.  Change all the cards from congratulations to condolences.  Yeah, just a fucking pen while you scratch it out.  White out on the card. 
[03:17:30]  It's a wedding cake, but with tears near it.  Simon from Virginia, number 67.  You always remind me to take my heart medication.  They're singing that funny song.  Oh, the bride grabs her chest.  The bride grabs her chest.  Number 105.  Oh, the bride grabs her chest. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, the bride grabs her chest.  All right.  This was a good one.  This was a good one.  Last one.  This was a good one.  Oh, that's a horrible sound. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, that'll be okay.  Great song. 
[03:19:00]  Dave B. from Philly writes, I heard she died during Daddy's Little Corpse.  Oh, no.  That's not right.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Let's say hi to Devon in Virginia Beach.  Devon.  Kevin in Virginia Beach.  But the husband told her she looked drop-dead gorgeous today.  That's funny.  Let's go to Rich in Wisconsin.  Hey, Anthony.  Yo.  It could have been your all-time favorite dream, Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Cumia. 
[03:19:30]  You know what Julie says?  Everybody was going over to the table and very discreetly taking back their envelopes.  I won't be needing this.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  What's up?  Hey, bu-bu-boys.  Hey.  I wanted to know, was her song totally eclipsed with a heart?  Eclipsed by Bacon Fat.  We go to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Something old, something new, something borrowed. 
[03:20:00]  I guess you were something blue.  Oh, God.  Jeez.  John, Michigan.  Hey.  Oh, you forgot to ask if a dude from Wisconsin was a kid.  I'm just a little tired.  Number 42.  Did she love deep fried fatty foods?  God, I suck.  Yeah, sorry.  You had it.  You promised to love and honor until death do your part.  All right.  That was quick.  Yes. 
[03:20:30]  You can have time to think about it if you want.  Reception.  Of course.  No need to rush.  Number 13.  You make my heart skip a beat.  Justin B. from PA.  All right.  Well, how many jokes can we make about this?  A lot more.  You think?  I think so.  You take my breath away.  Well, now people are coming up with the wedding songs.  Bob and Cincinnati.  I heard their wedding song was Take My Breath Away.  She's got Betty Davis eyes, but William Frawley Hart.  William Frawley. 
[03:21:00]  Let's say hi to Joe in Ohio.  Joe?  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you for remembering.  It's been a while.  Hey, when they were consummating the marriage, he says, what are you going to do, just lay  there?  Oh, now I suck.  Oh, come on.  It wasn't that bad.  Jeez.  Let's say hi to Martin in Missouri.  Martin?  Hey, I want to know if they called G.P.S. 
[03:21:30]  Lindy Lunker.  Let's say hi to Johnny in Cleveland.  Johnny.  Hey, what's going on there, guys?  Hey.  The ironic thing was that he was the one who was afraid to take the plunge.  Wow.  Yeah.  What?  Is this show being done on a highway outside of Rochester? 
[03:22:00]  Thank you, Seth.  I didn't get it.  There was a 30-some-odd car pileup outside Rochester.  Jesus.  Right.  I know.  She was suffering from cold feet and everything else.  Let's say hi to Chuck in Philly, Chuck.  Wow, you look great.  Who did you need a bride?  The coroner.  Sam.  That's all God.  Sorry, Chuck. 
[03:22:30]  It was a good line.  That's all right.  They barreled right over you.  Sorry, what did you say, Chuck?  That's all right.  I know.  It was just basically that God needed a bride.  They found wedding cake all over her lips, Sam.  She was dancing and she fell down.  Well, gee, Quinn, shut up, Sam.  Your genitals are tiny.  Get my members-only jacket.  I'm going to drive by an explosion and then dust again. 
[03:23:00]  Why would a coroner do that, Jimsy?  Isn't he supposed to stay back at the lab and do the autopsies?  Why are you always doing the acts?  That's easy for you to say, but I think she was murdered.  Oh, okay.  Murder.  They found Fudgy the Whale in her vagina, Sam.  I think it was murder because the cake only came with the groom standing up and the bride 
[03:23:30]  was lying face down on the top of the cake, Sam.  Hey, Lieutenant Mountahan here.  Get away from me.  Your action is inconsistent with everyone else on this show.  Jimsy.  Let's go to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  You had me at...  Let's go to Fistful of Yen. 
[03:24:00]  Fistful of Yen.  Hey, love you.  Love the show.  They're doing a movie based on this called No Weddings and One Funeral.  Lance in North Dakota.  Lance.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Hey.  I'm going to kickstart my heart. 
[03:24:30]  For what?  Jimmy, what's going on over there?  Hold on, hold on.  Jimmy's like on the floor.  His chair's my fucking...  Because these headphones have a cord, which is where I can actually stand here and then  go broadcast at Lincoln Center with.  That would be a long distance for the people that aren't close by.  Always get fucking caught on the wheels.  I know, man.  And I'm always getting tangled up.  There are some days I fall on the floor because the cord is tangled up in my feet, around  my dick. 
[03:25:00]  Look at what he's trying to do to free you.  How did I get so tangled up?  What was I doing?  I was just talking.  Was I pretzeling and no one was telling me?  He's pretzeling again.  Keep it under your hat.  Pretzeling.  All right.  We got a mistress on the line.  Mistress Roxanne.  Do we know her?  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Hold on.  Here we are.  All right.  Mistress Roxanne, how are you?  I'm doing great.  How are you?  Good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Where do you work? 
[03:25:30]  Well, I'm an independent mistress and I rent space in Midtown Manhattan.  Okay.  Do you do ad calls or in calls or both?  I do both.  Okay.  Yellowtreats at AOL.com.  Pardon me?  I was just saying you could email me.  You might have a customer.  What's your name?  Mistress Roxanne?  Oh, yes.  Roxanne, you heard the story about the guy, brain damage, turned blue over the weekend  here in New York at the Nutcracker Suite.  Yes.  All we're trying to figure out is like some of these fetishes are really bizarre and we're 
[03:26:00]  trying to figure out how they're sexual in nature.  Well, um...  For example, a guy hanging from a dog collar for hours on end and that's all...  How is that sexual?  I don't get it.  Well, to many people it's not sexual in nature.  It's therapy in some sort of way.  Um, you could go through from childhood experiences.  Many of the clients that I see come and talk to me about their personal problems or things 
[03:26:30]  that are going on in their life and then, you know, they have certain things they like.  Some people like feet.  Some people like to be spanked brutally hard.  Um, one guy told me once that to be beaten really hard was because he never got spanked as a child.  And he wanted to see what it was like.  He used to hear his friend get hit, um, every once in a while. 
[03:27:00]  Because he lived next door and I guess the window would be open.  So what do you...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  What do you think it was that made it...  Was it the connection he felt that other boy had to his mommy?  Possibly.  Yeah, it could be that.  And, um, it's all the thought of missing out on something.  And some people, um, are big time...  You know, I've dominated everyone from famous people to politicians.  I never would say who they are because expression is always a must. 
[03:27:30]  But, um, some people like to dress up like a lady.  Like, this man in high heels.  I mean, they don't dare tell people they're a cross-dresser.  Many of the people are married.  Hey, are you a MILF?  Yes, I am.  Is that you?  It says, uh, Baltimore, uh, D.C. and Philly?  Pardon me?  Is that your ad where you call it MISDRESS but you spell it M-I-Z?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  M-I-Z.  Yeah.  What kind of fetish do you specialize in?  What's your favorite? 
[03:28:00]  And what don't you do?  I do a lot of role play, um, and blogging.  And I, and I'm pretty good at bondage and hog ties.  Do you do showers?  Um, no, I do not.  I, you know, there's a lot of things some people do, but that's one of the things I do not do.  You think that's disgusting, right?  Ruby showers, you think, are gross?  Well, um, I would never do that.  Although, you know, a lot of people have done this with their boyfriends or... 
[03:28:30]  What do you think of a guy that might like a log in his mouth every once in a while?  Uh, that's not my thing.  That's awful, right?  But, you know, there's something for everyone, you know?  Can we role play a little bit?  Can we try some role play?  I've never role played.  All right.  I'm also a phone sex operator, too.  Okay, how about, um, now, I'm going to say this.  I'm going to say, um, um, could you get the audio, and I want you to say, I'm too busy.  Oh, God. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, God.  What kind of, uh, what kind of role play do you, can we do?  Well, we got Adam here.  He's never kissed a girl.  You know what?  Oh, the little...  Get Adam in here.  Yeah, that's a good call.  We're calling him to do something nice for this kid.  Hold on, sweetheart.  We're going to get somebody for you.  Okay.  Yeah, we should get her to do something with Big A.  What's a sexy word that you refer to the penis as?  Well, I call it, I don't know if I can say it on the air. 
[03:29:30]  Yes, you can.  It's a satellite radio.  Yes, you can say whatever you want.  Oh, I call it a little pussy if it's really small.  Yikes.  I mean, you know, that's about it, you know, because it's all different, you know, things.  But, um, I don't know.  I don't really call it anything.  I just, I just basically pick them or, you know, say terrible things, you know.  Basically stomp your high heel into his little pussy. 
[03:30:00]  It's a person.  Little Willie.  I call it Little Willie usually or something.  All right, we have, uh, we have an intern in here.  His name's Adam.  He's never kissed a girl.  Um, you're 22?  I forgot.  22.  He's 22 years old.  Uh, and he's never kissed a girl.  He's a weirdo.  You want to do some phone sex with, uh, Mistress Roxanne?  I would, I would love to.  You want to sit down so we don't see your raging heart on?  Okay.  He won't have a raging heart on unless at the end of, like, at that wedding he would have. 
[03:30:30]  Well, we think, we don't know what's wrong with Adam.  Something's up with Adam.  If you could get him to sport some wood, then I would, I would guess that you're pretty damn  good at the, at the, uh, the phone sex.  Looks like he's going to testify.  Yeah.  All right.  How do we get this going?  Adam's on the phone with you.  Well, um, he's got to tell me what he's into first.  Or what he thinks he's into when he's alone by himself.  Okay.  Okay.  Uh, what I'm into is, uh, is pornography. 
[03:31:00]  Um, I like, I like to, uh, I like to touch myself.  Um, usually, usually around five o'clock.  Why?  You pencil it in at a certain time.  Hold on.  He's telling her nothing.  He's telling her nothing.  No, I, I'm in, I'm into, uh, she's asking what you like sexually.  Yeah.  Uh, what I like sexually, um, I like, uh, I like ass.  Um, I like, uh, I like, uh, I like a nice body, uh, that, that is properly taken care 
[03:31:30]  of.  Uh, uh, when you, when you look at the porn, what pictures, what kind of porn are you looking  at?  Um, I look at, um, milf hunter porn.  Milf hunter.  And, uh, and, and just, uh, a variety of porn.  Um, Asian.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Blonde, brown.  It doesn't matter. 
[03:32:00]  I feel like, yeah, it's just porn.  Yeah.  Now, um, now, have you ever thought of a role play?  I, I've never thought of a, I, I kind of like the, the whole teacher role play thing.  You know, like, uh, like I, like I got a bad grade.  I got to go clean the erasers.  All right.  So what's your name again?  It's role playing.  My name is Brad Getz.  Adam.  His name's Adam.  Yeah.  Adam.  Adam.  You know you have to stay up to school this evening, don't you?  Up to school, don't you? 
[03:32:30]  I, I do?  Yes.  You know, I saw you picking up Susie's skirt the other day, and I don't really like it.  You even pinched her ass.  Yeah.  Susie was a, uh, was a real bitch.  Hey, watch your mouth, young man.  You know what?  What?  This, this is the state of Texas, so there's corporal punishment here.  Ooh.  And your parents signed a waiver.  So you know what? 
[03:33:00]  Yes.  I think I'm going to put you over my knee, maybe.  You've never been spanked?  Uh, when I was a small child.  Yeah.  Well, but before that.  No.  I'm going to make you, you know, how old are you now?  Are you, how old are you now?  You're like, um, 19.  22.  You're 22.  You're going to college. 
[03:33:30]  When's the last time you got laid?  I've never been laid.  You haven't?  You're still a virgin?  Yes.  Well, maybe that, now I understand you a little bit more.  Haven't you ever thought about what it would be like?  You know, what are you looking down my shirt for?  I, I...  You keep looking at my cleavage.  I apologize.  You know what?  You should never have seen that before.  Maybe I should unzip my shirt a little bit for you just to see what it looks like. 
[03:34:00]  Just to, you know.  Now I'm going to put your hands on my zipper and I want you to unzip it.  My jacket.  You see that bra?  It's got all the lace on it.  Isn't that pretty?  Very.  You know, what I want you to do is just touch the outside of the lace right now. 
[03:34:30]  Can't you feel the warmth of my breath?  In your hands?  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  It's...  And then I keep going.  As a, as a...  Boring.  She just tapped out.  No.  No, she wasn't bad, though.  I don't know.  I usually do it faster.  I do it faster.  But I was, like, nervous, too.  I've never done this on the air before.  Oh, my God.  You know what I never noticed?  He sounds like Adam Sandler.  Bleep! 
[03:35:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, Adam.  Yeah, yeah.  No, but I mean, it's difficult to do this, like, on the spot.  Can I try it with you?  I mean, he was a little too shy.  I kind of like one...  Yeah, Jimmy's good at this stuff.  Do you do incest role play?  Adam, thank you.  Thanks, Adam.  Do I do what?  Incest role play.  Well, I don't discuss that.  I don't discuss that.  Well, I'm saying I wanted to try some.  I don't...  It's actually illegal.  No, it's not. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, incest, you said.  Incest role play.  I've never done that.  Do you think you said incense?  Yeah, what do you think I said?  No, no, no.  No, I thought you meant...  Incest?  To say that you are...  No, no, no.  To say you are underage.  You're not allowed to say you're underage.  Yes, you are.  First of all, I'm saying incest, but you're allowed to do age play.  Of course you're allowed to.  You're allowed to show children murdered in movies.  They don't charge you with killing a kid.  You're actually allowed to...  No, no, no.  No, but actually there's certain legal things. 
[03:36:00]  I mean, not that I don't do it.  I do, but I wouldn't do it on the air, you know, because, you know, there's certain things  that...  Can you get Roland in here?  You're not allowed to.  You're allowed to portray something.  We all know you're an adult.  Everyone knows you're an adult.  No, I do know that, but there's certain...  With the company that I work for, I'm not allowed to, you know.  Just say it's company policy. 
[03:36:30]  Don't say it's a legal thing.  It's not a legal thing.  No, no.  I mean, it's a company policy.  It's a future act.  For the, you know...  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You just suck.  But that's what I do all the time.  I mean, that's like...  You just stink on ice.  There's nothing...  Nothing sexier.  They won't let you do...  Hold on.  They won't let you do, like, young age play?  No.  How about if I pretend I'm young?  No, even if you pretend you're young.  I mean, you know, but that's what you get a lot. 
[03:37:00]  How about just regular incest, then?  Like, if I have a whole mommy-son thing, can we try that?  Because I think that's very sexy.  It's very hard to find anyone who could do the real...  I would never want to really do it with my mom, but it's cool to find someone who could  do it.  Yeah, yeah, people who wouldn't do it...  Yeah, it's their taboo of...  It's their...  It's just being taboo.  Well, can we try some?  Pardon me?  Can we try some?  Oh.  I mean, I can joke around a little bit, yeah, but... 
[03:37:30]  Mommy.  Mommy.  I've been really bad.  Um, hmm.  What have you done?  Can I have a pen for a second?  Huh?  What happened?  Um, I didn't clean up my room like you told me to, and I was really bad in school today.  Well, you know what?  This keeps happening over and over.  You know, I'm going to just ground you and keep you in the closet or something.  You know?  What do I have to do? 
[03:38:00]  Hmm?  Um...  What's going on?  Why do you think you keep doing these things?  Because I'm three.  Oh.  I'm only kidding.  I'm only kidding.  You know what?  I'm all...  No, I'm teasing you.  I'm teasing you.  I'm not into incest at all.  I'm just joking.  I kind of set you up for that.  We do have a lot of callers, I think.  Yeah, we certainly do, Jimmy.  Um, that are just going to be...  Yeah, but, uh, before we get to the callers, so...  So...  When you go to, like, an S&M club and you get these weird things done, it's...  Does it...  How does it... 
[03:38:30]  How does it connect to sex?  We don't get that.  We kind of asked that earlier, but you didn't really explain it.  Well, it's...  Some...  It's not really necessarily sex to some people.  It's...  It's just like...  It's just a naughty thing that's been going on in their mind that they want pain or that  they like pain.  Right.  Um...  It's all different people, you know?  Yeah.  It's...  Come on.  Has anyone ever, uh...  Hold on to your hats.  Pinch you, pinch you, and, you know...  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And the nipples, and it kind of, like, was loud. 
[03:39:00]  Go to the phone, sir.  Right, right.  Yeah.  You know, some people like that.  And it's amazing how that just turns into something, you know?  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, you know...  Yeah.  Somebody pinching you, kicking you in the balls.  What was the...  Oh, when guys have that, when guys want to be trampled on, a lot of them end up, um...  Liking it because they were kicked in the balls as a kid.  Sure, sure.  So they listen to physical graffiti.  And it was a remembrance of a girl that they had a crush on.  As a mistress, what was the strangest request you got?  Oh, the strangest request. 
[03:39:30]  To be mummified.  Oh.  He was wearing, like, a total, like, wetsuit.  Oh, really?  He mummified it for three hours, only a tube out of his mouth.  Uh-huh.  Um, and, you know, of course, you have to watch constantly.  Sure, sure.  You know, you have to make sure you're in the room at all times.  Sure.  And that's why I was surprised that somebody would...  I mean, you know, when you're suspending somebody.  But, um, regardless.  Uh, yeah, mummified for three hours. 
[03:40:00]  So you think they're going to go to jail?  All right.  Uh, no.  You want to take some phone calls, or...?  Yeah, and then the man, after that, after being mummified for three hours, I hung him  upside down by his feet, you know, beating him, and put electrodes on him.  Do you have to take a course to make sure you do this properly?  Oh, yes.  No, you have to know what you're doing, you know?  You get trained.  It's like a CPR class.  They've got, like, half a torso laying on the floor, right?  No, no.  This is the proper way to hang a body from their feet. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, you know what?  Now, don't do it the other way, or they'll die.  You ask people, you ask people, too.  Like, do you have any medical problems?  You know, you want to make sure, because it's supposed to be about having fun.  How long can you hold your breath?  Sure.  Well, Mistress Roxanne, I haven't seen interest like this in quite some time now.  Yeah, the phones are lit.  They certainly are, Anthony.  Let's say hi to, which one do you want to go to?  Probably Steve, I guess.  All right, let's go to Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve, what's going on? 
[03:41:00]  Hello.  Hi, how are you, Steve?  Hello, Mistress.  How are you?  I'm a little shy.  I've only dabbled a bit.  I've never actually talked to a Mistress, but I've been very, very curious about it.  Mm-hmm.  I kind of want to be, like, mummified while I scroll, scroll, scroll.  Is it possible for, like, a mummification fantasy to be done?  I'm like, I don't know.  I just want it to be mummified somehow because, basically, that's how productive I am at work.  So I figured I might as well at least be, like, hello? 
[03:41:30]  Yes, I'm listening.  I'm sorry.  I'm just, I'm a little bit shy.  A little nervous there, Steve.  I'm kind of looking at myself in the mirror with tattoos.  How do you feel about mummification, and is it very dangerous?  Because I'm always afraid of my nose getting clogged.  Well, yeah.  You have to be careful.  I mean, you wouldn't start out with complete mummification right away.  You'd have to start out first with breath play.  Mumm, I have had sex in your mouth at a Greek wedding in Florida. 
[03:42:00]  Mumm, I'd like to spank this woman with a tractor trailer.  I only, I only do this when you want it.  Mumm, this woman satisfies my boring fetish.  I never dominate those people who don't want to be dominated. 
[03:42:30]  It's all about having fun and being naughty.  I'm sorry about that.  Every once in a while we get a prank call that comes in.  Yeah.  So you were saying, Mistress Roxanne, we're trying to take this very seriously today  because, you know, it was a very interesting case that happened over the weekend here in New York City.  No, it is very unfortunate.  Yeah.  And I think part of it might have been due to not proper training.  You know, it's like, you know, I don't know.  I just don't know what to say. 
[03:43:00]  It's just a sad, unfortunate thing that happened.  Yeah.  But, yeah.  As we just, so what's the number one fetish you really get involved in?  Well, I do a lot of mommy role play.  Mommy role play, right, right.  Yeah, that's the thing, and medical role play.  Yeah.  Medical.  What did you do before this job? 
[03:43:30]  Well, I do acting.  Many, many actresses are doms.  You what?  I'm acting and sing.  I act and I sing.  Yeah.  Acting?  Yeah.  Oh.  Do you do any of the urine stuff, though?  No, I do not do that.  Is it a problem you have with the diabetes?  No.  I just, I'm just not into it.  There's certain things some people are into.  What kind of mommy things do you do? 
[03:44:00]  Oh, oh, you mean diapers and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought you were going back to the other thing, the shower thing.  No.  Oh, you know, things.  Yeah, I do various types of things.  It's like, you know, you've got a bottle, you know, you feed them, you know, sometimes.  Do you ever, like, openly laugh at these creeps?  Oh, of course.  Oh, my goodness.  But when you're not supposed to be laughing at them.  Why don't you just keep talking?  No problem. 
[03:44:30]  Lots of times I just sort of choose to come in.  Sometimes people have, like, a two-part question, but that's okay.  You do whatever you have to do.  I think you need a spanking, miss.  Got to spank the boring right out of you.  Now, Valentine's Day right around the corner.  Do you get a lot of couples for Valentine's Day?  Well, I didn't even, like, finish my question that time.  What?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, I guess you could talk now.  No, no, I cut off.  It sounded like I couldn't hear you for a minute. 
[03:45:00]  No, I was right there.  No, my cell phone cut out.  Now, what did you say?  Valentine's Day!  Yeah, what about it?  Is business good?  Yes, usually.  Yeah.  Because, you know, people are lonely, or some people just want to do something crazy.  Right.  Like a heart-shaped box, putting their ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you do couples, or what?  Of course. 
[03:45:30]  I do a lot of couples training.  Yeah.  Because a lot of times the guy's into it.  They're drinking ruby port on the Today Show, I swear to God.  Chocolate and wine.  They're drinking ruby port.  Oh, God.  As in a ruby shower.  All right, let's say hi to Paul.  Paul?  Hello, mistress.  Oh, is this Uncle Paul?  Yeah, how are you?  Hey, Uncle Paul.  Mistress Roxanne, Uncle Paul's a faithful listener to this show.  He's terrific.  Hello. 
[03:46:00]  Hi, how are you?  I have to take issue with you saying that the age play isn't proper,  because I've been involved in many scenarios where the age play was used.  How could you say that's against the law?  I think that that's...  No, no, no.  Because, you know, go ahead.  You talk.  I was just finishing up.  It's all about you.  No, I know.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  I'm just a caller.  What do I know?  I had ADHD. 
[03:46:30]  I didn't take my medicine yet.  You're too much.  Humsicle.  So how could you say that's against the age play?  Only during...  It's a contract I have with the phone people that I...  This fat bitch should be attacking Roy Scheider in a boat. 
[03:47:00]  Ramone.  The Clintons should be pimping this blimp out to SeaWorld.  Ramone.  If she won a Grammy, her name would be Herbie Fatback.  You sound like one of the clients that I have. 
[03:47:30]  Mistress Roxanne, I apologize.  Did it sound just like Uncle Paul, everyone?  That usually calls the show?  That's so weird.  No, that guy sounds just like...  I think I know who he is.  Yeah, how would you know that guy?  Because he's a guy that does phone pranks.  Really?  Really?  Really?  Oh.  What kind of phone pranks?  Oh, just calls up various places and...  Yeah.  He calls us a lot, though.  All right, you finish up.  No, he calls us a lot, though, and he always disturbs.  We try to have a serious conversation with somebody, and he goes in to different people. 
[03:48:00]  It's kind of irritating.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  There's a very good question coming in from Scott in Boston.  Scott, what's up?  Yes.  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you?  Pretty good.  You're talking to Mistress Roxanne.  Go ahead, Scott.  Yes, Mistress Roxanne.  I was just curious if you were suggesting that we raise super kids.  Oh, that's a good question.  That you what?  Yeah, that we are.  You were suggesting we raise super kids.  Right.  That's a very good question, Scott.  Mistress Roxanne, yes.  I don't know what you mean by that. 
[03:48:30]  Of course you've heard of the phenomenon of super kids by now.  Yeah.  No, I haven't heard that.  Really?  I haven't heard of that.  And you call yourself a mistress?  Yeah.  I mean, I am a mistress.  I've been doing this for 10 years.  Mm-hmm.  Are you up on the latest stuff as far as, you know, the S&M fetish world goes?  Well, I go to some parties in a while, but I don't know what super kids is.  I haven't heard that.  You don't know what super kids is all about.  Bill, why don't you explain to Mistress Roxanne what super kids is all about? 
[03:49:00]  It's a new phenomenon.  Sure.  Yeah.  It's these kids who are actually born with male-sized, adult-sized genitalia.  Oh, wow.  And they make them run track, and they try to give them the Jordan shorts, but sometimes  they don't, so it gets a little weird.  Why are you laughing?  You're serious?  Yes.  You haven't heard of super kids.  Yeah.  They have large genitals. 
[03:49:30]  No.  And they're only going to get bigger after puberty.  And there's adult males out there who, like, wish they were a super kid, so they kind  of go back and make believe they're a kid with giant, like, genitalia.  Oh.  No, I've never got a request for that, ever.  You're very specific.  You don't seem to be, like, you know, user-friendly, like, across the map.  Right.  In fact, you know, if I could be so bold, you're kind of ignorant in some areas.  Yeah.  The whole thing with the super kids thing is the embarrassment of having giant genitals 
[03:50:00]  as a kid.  It freaks the mothers out.  I've never had anybody talk to me about that.  And you've been doing this for 10 years, and you don't know what super kids is about.  That is really fucked up, man.  What'd you do before this?  No, it's not.  Not really, because my clients that I have are not into that.  I think you're probably a bit lazy when it comes to maybe, you know, making sure you're  up on, you know, what's going on out there, because super kids is something that's been 
[03:50:30]  going on for about a year or so now.  No, because I don't have a request for it.  It's a phenomenon that started overseas.  Nobody's going to judge you if you say you've only been doing it, you know, for, you know,  six years or weeks.  I've been doing it for 10 years.  I've been doing this for 10 years, but if somebody doesn't have a request for it.  Whoa, why are you so defensive here?  Super kids, we all know.  It's really odd.  No, you know, because you must be really into reading up on everything.  No, we do a radio show.  We do a radio show.  We talk about everything, and we've had many discussions on super kids. 
[03:51:00]  Well, I don't have satellite radio.  Well, if you just Google it, I mean, you can...  I'm sure you're just orbiting you.  Yeah, I mean, I'll Google it.  I'll check it out, but I've never heard of it.  Yeah, Google that.  Why don't you?  Usually people want to be laughed at for being too small.  You're responsible.  Right.  All right.  So how do we end this?  Well, we appreciate the call.  And, I mean, it was kind of helpful to have you on because we didn't really have anybody 
[03:51:30]  else calling about fetish.  Yeah.  Well, I have my 800 number.  Where can they get a hold of you if they want a fetish session?  Okay, it's 1-800.  Well, I wouldn't give out the number.  Yeah, you might not watch it.  You don't really sell yourself that well.  We have a lot of listeners.  What website?  It would actually hurt business, I'm thinking.  No, no, no.  This is my phone session business.  My phone.  Okay.  Yeah, no.  Well, hey, she wants to give out her number for phone session business.  Why not?  Why would she at this point?  She's going to get a lot, I'm sure.  Yeah.  From this segment. 
[03:52:00]  That's good.  I say you give it out if you want to, madam.  Madam.  Yeah.  1-800.  Hey.  2-7-5.  2-7-5.  5-3-3-6.  8-6.  All right.  extension 0-4-4-4-8-9-5-1.  It's very convenient.  It's easy to remember.  Oh, mighty.  What are you, the star of Lost?  Or it's Mr. Roxanne on Night Flirt. 
[03:52:30]  Roxanne.  Stop it.  Do you think, though, like...  What's your real name?  Yeah, what is your real name?  What's your real name?  Deirdre.  What is it?  Molly.  You sound like a Deirdre.  No, I'm sure you're good at what you do.  You're a MILF, and you're probably into spanking.  I mean, I'm sure you're good.  Do you ever slip a finger in there just to show somebody who's really the boss?  Yeah.  For real.  Like, you're spanking him, and a finger goes in.  You're like, ah, look who made an appearance.  And they go, teehee.  Oh, you're being a naughty boy, aren't you?  I am.  I actually have a piece of strop on my pants.  Hey, yeah.  Ah, you're being a naughty boy. 
[03:53:00]  I like you.  You could also be found at stupidcunt.com.  Is that true?  I don't think so.  Let me look.  You're not being nice, are you?  That was rude.  That was, uh...  You need to be disciplined.  That was just an error.  Somebody, uh, emailed that in.  Well, that's all right.  Yeah.  What's the web address if they want to get you?  The real one.  Pardon me?  What's the web address if they want to reach you?  What's the real one? 
[03:53:30]  Isuckatmyjob.com.  No, they can write me on my email address.  It's, it's, it's, it's M-I, it's Mistress Roxanne, M-I-Z-T-R-E-S-S.  Noddingoff.org.  R-O-X-Z-A-N-N-E.  Yeah.  At A-O-L.  You misspelled Roxanne, though.  R-O-X-Z-A-N-N-E.  I mean, Mistress.  Right.  And Mistress is spelled wrong, too.  It's M-I-Z, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many Mistress Roxannes are out there?
