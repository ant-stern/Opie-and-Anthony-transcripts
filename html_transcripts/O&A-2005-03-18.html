<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM202 broadcast began with a recap of their successful St. Patrick's Day live show from the Hard Rock Cafe.  They discussed the challenges of juggling a live bar audience and their radio listeners, contrasting this positive experience with past difficulties encountered during other live broadcasts.  The show's success led to the announcement of another live broadcast at Bill's Bar in Boston on April 11th, coinciding with the Red Sox-Yankees opening day game.  Listeners were encouraged to help promote the event, given Opie and Anthony's upcoming two-week vacation.  The hosts revealed that their "best of" shows airing during their absence would include new material and interviews by Bruce Kelly, featuring Pat from Munaki.

Opie detailed his struggles booking a solo trip to Atlantis in the Bahamas for Easter week, while Anthony briefly discussed his own, less complicated vacation plans.  Humorous anecdotes from the Hard Rock show followed, including a listener accidentally wetting themselves and stories about their security team, Kenny and Master Poe, handling unruly patrons.  Opie also described his daily Manhattan commute on rollerblades, and the hosts touched upon the rivalry between the whackbag.com and opianthony.net message boards. A caller, "Flea," unsuccessfully attempted to schedule a news segment due to the impending vacation.  The broadcast frequently used offensive language.  Finally, the show concluded with the announcement that Bill Burr would be a guest, filling in for Jim Norton, who was expected to call in later.

[00:03:00]  The A.P.N. Anthony Show XM202  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites to fight the forces of evil. 
[00:03:30]  The A.P.N. Anthony Show XM202  The A.P.N. Anthony Show XM202  I want to be known as notorious.  No!  A.P.X.A.K.  A.P.N. Anthony Show XM202  Everyone is always in my way.  A.P.N. Anthony Show XM202  And B.C.A.P.A.P.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  A.P.N. Anthony Show XM202  That looks like quirly spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  You ever see him yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it excites.  Paukatosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up. 
[00:04:00]  And armed with superhuman powers.  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens, average heroes.  Those quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are just mixed.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  We look like assholes right now, man.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law. 
[00:05:00]  O-N-A body rock.  O-N-A body rock.  O-N-A body rock.  Surely you can't be serious.  I am serious.  And don't call me Shirley.  Let's do it!  Of course there's something wrong with him.  He's a Negro. 
[00:05:30]  Bueller.  Bueller.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Get his mind to P's and Q's, buster.  And remember who you're dealing with.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:06:00]  O-N-A party rock.  O-N-A party rock.  Like, I gotta adjust my volumes here.  I don't know.  Yeah.  They were messing with something while we were broadcasting live from the Hard Rock Cafe yesterday.  No.  Paddy's Day.  Really?  I think so.  The levels are really, really hot.  I don't know.  Whatever.  They're gonna fix all that when we go on vacation, so.  That's right.  We did set a goal.  When we get back from vacation, we're gonna be off the premium channel.  Yeah, that's gonna be nice.  And, uh, our goal is to bitch much, much less. 
[00:06:30]  Lesser is gooder.  I wasn't gonna say not bitch.  No.  Because we always have to bitch about something.  It's our nature.  We're incapable of not bitching.  Stop.  How you doing, Anthony?  Very good.  Have you...  A little sleepy.  I was gonna say, have you recovered from yesterday?  A little sleepy.  It was weird drinking that early.  Because, uh, I pretty much nursed the Bloody Mary the whole morning, you know?  It's a pretty big one. 
[00:07:00]  Pretty strong.  But still, you know, nursing.  I didn't want to get hammered at nine in the morning like some of our listeners were for  St. Paddy's Day.  We were at the Hard Rock doing it up yesterday.  Oh, my God.  I never expected that many people, excuse me, that many people to show up for our first broadcast.  Yeah, it was very cool.  Our first live broadcast.  And Anthony and I were sitting in the studio here preparing for today's show.  And, uh, we went to each other.  Didn't we make a rule years ago that we would never do another live broadcast in front of  our fans like that?  Yeah, we figured we'd separate. 
[00:07:30]  We were either gonna do a live show somewhere, or we're gonna do a broadcast somewhere, but  not the two.  Yeah.  We didn't like actually going, having a live crowd, and doing a broadcast at the same  time, so we rarely ever did it.  And I go, eh, why did we do that yesterday?  And he goes, well, I think we just forgot.  I think over the time that's gone by, we forgot.  Because usually, it's a complete disaster.  It's very difficult to entertain a bar full of animals and do a radio show at the same 
[00:08:00]  time to entertain the people that are listening.  The people in the bar completely forget that you're on the air, and you have a lot of people  to entertain besides them that are just in the bar.  They get very self-centered and selfish, Opie.  They want to have us all to themselves.  To put it in perspective, the crowd that was there yesterday represents less than 1% of  the total audience listening to the program.  Way less than 1%. 
[00:08:30]  Way less.  It's a fraction of a 1%.  But to them, you know, because they're there, they think it's all about them.  It's all about them.  And you know what?  It was all about them, and they gave us great radio.  Yeah.  So if we sit there, and we're actually doing a break that doesn't involve the live audience,  they start getting a little restless.  Yeah.  And rambunctious.  Yeah.  And in the past, that's been a complete disaster.  There was one point, there was a lull in the action early on in the broadcast, and I'm  sitting up there going, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no. 
[00:09:00]  And this was before the bar opened and all that.  I'm thinking, this has a recipe for disaster.  I knew we were fine once the bar opened.  And then all of a sudden, we turned the corner, and we never looked back, and the gang in Washington,  they called all night long saying it was the best show we've done for XM Satellite Radio.  That was a fun one.  And, I mean, it was one of those where everybody there had a good time, and the people that  were listening at home enjoyed what they heard and actually wished they were down there.  Yeah.  And I guess we'll be doing more live broadcasts.  I mean, we hit the road to do stupid things. 
[00:09:30]  What?  Oh, I know.  All right.  Thanks, Ben.  This just in, Ben.  I know.  Wow.  Kind of important memo.  Thank you, Ben.  It was actually timely.  What?  It was timely.  You said we were going to do more live broadcasts.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to hit this in a second.  Thank you, Ben.  Yeah, we'll do more until we really screw it up.  Well, yeah, the point I was going to make, I guess it was such a success yesterday, I  guess we have to go back to doing the live radio show in front of fans.  I mean, we hit the road to do stuff.  Like, Mardi Gras wasn't really our crowd.  We're just kind of looking from a balcony at the debauchery, you know? 
[00:10:00]  Yep.  When we went to Vegas, there weren't really a lot of fans around.  When we went to Los Angeles, not a lot of fans around.  Yeah.  This was the first live broadcast that we did in front of our fans in years.  It was, you know what it was?  They were closed events that we have done these live broadcasts at.  You know?  You go to the electronic show.  Those are, you know, electronic geeks.  You can't just come off the street and walk into that place.  Yeah.  Same thing with the poker thing.  You can't just walk in to the poker thing.  Although some did.  Yeah, some did.  Some of you lunatics could figure anything out, so. 
[00:10:30]  But this one was, for the most part, you know, hey, listeners, come on down.  We're doing a live broadcast.  And, boy, man, what a crowd we had.  I had so much fun.  Usually I stress out big time in those situations, but I had a lot of fun.  And it was great to meet a lot of people.  And, you know, we saw some old faces, some new faces.  Message board people that show up that they introduce themselves as their message board name.  They don't even give their regular names.  And I was kind of, I was meeting some of the guys from the message board going, 
[00:11:00]  Wow, you're, yeah.  You're that guy?  You're that guy.  I'm like, you're famous.  I've been reading your posts for years.  Great stuff.  So it was a little give and take yesterday.  And now they're already discussing on the message boards.  I think the next live event, we need to wear t-shirts with our names on them.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, I think that's the big thing.  They're going to come up with some kind of message board t-shirt.  And then each one will have the name on the back.  I guess like a jersey or something, you know?  Why don't you just write p-t-on it?  All of a sudden it'll say p-niggity on the back of a shirt. 
[00:11:30]  I don't know.  That's a little much.  Cigars and scotch.  I think the names on the shirt, a little much.  I think you can just walk up to each other and figure it out.  If you're wearing name tags, it's closer and closer to being a Star Trek convention.  You know what?  I think they're going to do it, though, because the complaint they had was, you know,  there's so many people there and you don't really know which ones are from the message board.  Well, I was reading some of those posts where it was like, you were there?  I didn't even know you were there.  If they knew, they would have hung out with them, spoken with them. 
[00:12:00]  But a lot of these people didn't even hook up.  I think they're going to take it to the next level.  Yeah.  Shirts or some kind of thing that they could, you know, know others are there.  I was hanging out at the bar for a little while after the event was over, and that was interesting also.  You had, like, Master Poe was there, you know, working security.  And some guy comes in, and, you know, we had, like, that little circle.  We were hanging out at the bar, but there was, like, a circle of people, 
[00:12:30]  and we were exchanging ideas and conversation across the circle.  You were just exchanging shots.  Who were you kidding?  I was having...  You were exchanging ideas at the bar.  A little Jack and Ginger and, you know, hanging out, exchanging little ideas and talking.  But you have that circle set up, and some guy with a big, like, backpack thing comes up  and just walks in the middle of the circle.  And we start, you know, hey, what?  Walking right in the middle.  The Poe quickly removed him from the situation. 
[00:13:00]  It was quite nice to see.  I like that stuff.  You like that?  Although the best removal of the day had to be Kenny.  Kenny removed some guy that, like, kept going.  There was an area in the Hard Rock.  It's a small hallway kind of off the main floor.  And when the show is over, that's kind of where we go to get out of the way  while they set up for the signing that we do.  Yeah.  So we're hanging out back there, and no one's allowed back there.  It's kind of...  Not that we're so important, but it's kind of an area of the Hard Rock that the public isn't allowed in. 
[00:13:30]  And it gives us a chance to breathe.  Yeah, while they set up the area.  Because you really don't have a moment to yourself in those situations.  So you need to kind of go somewhere where you can think things over  and figure out what you're going to do next and things like that.  Kind of assess the show with each other and stuff like that.  You know, do our drugs, bang our whores.  Yeah, sure.  Living that rock and roll lifestyle.  Oh.  And this guy came back, and apparently Kenny had had some problems with him before  trying to get back into that area. 
[00:14:00]  So he comes back, and he's talking to me.  He's got, like, the drink in his hand, and he's talking to me.  And I'm just kind of, like, smiling and chatting with him and stuff.  Kenny comes up behind him, grabs him by the back of his neck.  With one hand.  With one hand.  And the guy was a rag doll at that point.  Kenny's just taking him.  You can see his feet kind of brushing the floor a little bit.  But Kenny just manhandled him out of that area.  It was great to watch. 
[00:14:30]  It was great to watch.  It really was.  Kenny is just amazing when it comes to removing people.  It's always great to watch, as long as it's not you, you know.  Of course.  If it's you, it sucks.  Oh, that sucks.  While you guys were in the back there, I was standing by the stage,  watching him bring the guy from the hallway.  Yeah.  Kenny's still holding the guy with one hand, removes the velvet rope,  puts him back there, puts the rope down, and goes,  please do not cross the line.  And then walks back to you guys.  Were we behind a velvet rope? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, we, yes we were.  It's, fuck.  What am I going to tell you, man?  Anyway, Anthony, for the fans, mark your calendar.  The next live broadcast will be live at Bill's Bar in Boston on Lansdowne Street.  Ah.  April 11th.  We're going to do the show from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. that day,  because it's opening day, and it's the Yankees' Red Sox.  It's going to be just an absolute zoo up there.  A mad house.  But that's going to be the next live broadcast in front of our fans. 
[00:15:30]  So we're going to need your help.  Wow.  You know how we talk about spread the virus?  Well, this is a situation where we need you to spread the virus,  because we're going to go on vacation.  We're not going to be able to promote this too much,  except for dumb promos in the middle of that stupid worst of crap  that we're throwing at you while we're away for two weeks.  Hey, we're adding in some little tidbits of new material during those best ofs.  Yeah, the faithful listeners should understand, you know,  in the 6 a.m. hour we do like a best of.  Yeah.  But Anthony and I give you new material, because we're setting up all the bits now. 
[00:16:00]  Little new stuff.  And sometimes they're funny, sometimes they're whatever.  Sometimes it's just setting up, and sometimes we get rambling on a subject.  Yeah, sometimes it's a nice brand-new nugget.  Who knows?  Of ONA information.  So we already started that, and then when we do the worst of,  when we go away for two weeks, we're setting up all the bits.  We go on some new rants.  Then we've got Bruce Kelly that interviewed us.  He interviewed a bunch of people that make the show as good as it is.  He was there yesterday? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, he was interviewing all sorts of people,  and all that's going to be mixed into our worst of when we're gone for two weeks.  So I think this is going to be the first time we go away  where it's going to be really, really interesting to listen to the worst ofs.  You know what's odd?  I'm really going to have to bring the MiFi with me on my little cruise  and listen up, because I know he interviewed Pat from Munaki yesterday.  Yeah.  He actually interviewed, as he was interviewing him,  we were asking to have Pat come to the stage,  but Pat was busy with his interviews.  Yeah, Pat was meeting the press backstage. 
[00:17:00]  Right, right.  He was meeting the press.  You know when the guys, they win their Oscar,  or the ladies win their Oscar,  and then they have to go back and do press?  Uh-huh.  Well, Pat did what he did on the stage, which we'll get into in a little bit,  and then he had to go backstage and meet the press.  Yeah, meet the press, and we were asking for him out on the stage,  but he was much too busy with his interviews.  I'm going to want to hear that, though.  So spread the virus for us.  Our next live broadcast will be live at Bill's Bar in Boston.  That's Lansdowne Street.  That's basically right behind the Green Monster.  Yep. 
[00:17:30]  You want to talk about O&A Party Rock.  That street is just nothing but a party 24-7, basically.  O&A Party Rock.  It'll be April 11th, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.  You know, that's the key to this.  It's going to be a different time to broadcast the show.  East Coast time, obviously.  Yanks, Red Sox.  It's going to be just a zoo, and we need your help to get the word out  so we can hang out with some fans up there, right?  Yes, some of the Baston fans.  Our return to Boston.  Yes.  Our return to Boston.  Ben's already getting all giddy about the whole Sox-Yankees thing and the ring. 
[00:18:00]  He just keeps talking about the rings,  how the Sox are going to be presented with their World Series ring,  and it's going to be right there in the Yankees' face.  Yeah.  So what?  And you know what?  These live broadcasts, I think we're on to something,  and they're only going to get bigger and better, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  We threw that one yesterday together, honestly, in a week.  Yep, pretty quick.  We really did, and a lot of the people that usually would come to those things,  they had other gigs going on.  So, I mean, the next one's going to be better, 
[00:18:30]  and it's just going to grow from there.  I have this idea.  I want to take this show to the smallest town in America and broadcast live.  Wow.  What the hell is the smallest town?  I have no idea.  Maybe some dumb little town in the middle of Nevada.  Because I'm sure there's probably a town with five people living in it.  One of those ghost town type of places.  Really?  Yeah, and then see who would, you know, road trip to do the broadcast with us.  What if Jim Backus comes and locks us up in a jail cell because he thinks we're trying to jump his claim 
[00:19:00]  and leaves us in the jail?  Can't get to our station.  And takes off with our station wagon.  It's just a thought, just an idea.  Can you imagine, though?  I hear you.  You know, just drive out in the middle of the desert in Nevada to some small old ghost town.  And, you know, a lot of truckers would, you know, would detour.  As they're driving through.  Maybe Roswell.  Maybe we could broadcast from Roswell, New Mexico.  A lot of the faithful listeners, I think, would road trip to something like that.  Yep.  Maybe have a concert in the middle of the desert like they do. 
[00:19:30]  That one thing they do every year?  I forgot the name of it, but...  Not Burning Man.  Where everyone gets naked in front of a big fire.  All those old hippies.  They get naked and they just do drugs all weekend in the middle of the desert and bands are playing.  So...  Despicable.  It's just a thought.  Yeah.  But I think it would be fun.  Maybe we do it in the summer when, you know, a lot of people possibly have some time off.  When it's 125 degrees in the desert.  Well, why not?  Eh, why not? 
[00:20:00]  We don't make it easy for ourselves ever.  Ever.  So what were some of the highlights yesterday from this broadcast, Anthony?  Well, from what I'm hearing...  I could go down the list.  I mean, we made a whole list and it's just...  Being there live is one thing.  You know, you could see what's happening and stuff.  But the people that were listening, they enjoyed the guy wetting himself and Pat from Unaki.  Yeah.  And the chick.  I just started looking at the pictures up on whackbag.com and opianthony.net.  But I think those are the two message boards that are taking off. 
[00:20:30]  There's a bunch of others.  They're trying to make their name for themselves.  And slowly but surely, they're moving up.  These are the networks, though.  Yeah.  Those are the networks.  And the other ones are like the small little channels.  Sure.  They're the public access channels and things like that.  They're trying to be the big boys.  And it's funny.  Whackbag.com and opianthony.net, they just battle all the time.  Yeah.  Even though they have a common like.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But there's two different sacks.  There's an XM serious thing going on there.  S-E-C-T-S, by the way. 
[00:21:00]  Huh?  It's like an XM serious thing going on with those two.  Yeah.  And then the rest of them are like, it's like the battle of, Whackbag is like a Home Depot.  Uh-huh.  And then the other ones are kind of like the mom and pop hardware store.  Just trying to stay alive.  Just trying to sell a few nails and screws every day to make the rent.  And then, you know, you get a Whackbag in there where it's, ooh, look at that.  There's lumber over here.  Yeah.  Everything I need right here in one place.  Yeah.  No, you got the two superpowers, opianthony.net and Whackbag.com. 
[00:21:30]  And they just battle it out.  Yeah.  They make fun of each other.  Yeah, they can't stand each other.  Like, we don't need to post as much as they do on Whackbag here at opianthony.net.  Let them post all they want.  I don't have to post a hundred times on this website just to prove I'm a fan of the show.  It's really funny, the battle that goes on with these guys.  Very serious, these guys.  Oh, yeah, they are.  So, anyway, yesterday at the Hard Rock, we did our St. Paddy's Day broadcast.  And the line started at 5 a.m., first of all. 
[00:22:00]  Well, Ben called me up.  Where's Ben?  Where's Steve?  We should get everyone in here to kind of recap what happened yesterday.  Ben called me up and said, Anthony, there's like 50 animals out in front of the Hard Rock.  And this was real early in the morning.  Yeah.  Because he called me at my hotel room, Opie.  My hotel room.  Where, you know, you were joking that I was staying at the Four Seasons.  That's where I was staying, people.  I didn't want anyone calling me. 
[00:22:30]  I don't want to be disturbed.  You've got to see that hotel.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I never stay there.  It's just the fact that the hotel I usually stay at was booked solid.  Well, now that I live in New York City, I don't get to, you know, stay in these great hotels anymore.  Why would you do that?  You've got to play.  I've stayed in just about every hotel in New York City.  No joke.  Yeah.  I mean, dozens of them over the years.  Maybe I should just, like, spend a weekend in a hotel.  Spend a weekend.  Why not?  Why not?  Stay over at the Four Seasons. 
[00:23:00]  So the lines start at 5 a.m.  Ben's calling you.  Ben called me and said, there's animals over there.  Do you want Poe to meet you somewhere?  And no.  I just want to.  I kind of like that.  I'll pull up.  I'll get out.  Say hi to the crowd.  And walk in the door.  I definitely enjoy the security when it matters.  But sometimes I'd rather just be alone.  Alone with my chick.  You know, at the poker thing, remember when we were out in L.A.? 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was me, my girlfriend, and Master Poe walking around after you guys all left.  We wanted to hang out and see how things ended with the poker game.  And, you know, have dinner, whatever.  And we're walking around, and everyone left, and Poe said, you know, I'll hang out.  And I said, like, three or four times, I was like, Poe, we're fine.  Don't worry about it.  We'll be okay.  And he is so, you know, into the security job that he wouldn't leave. 
[00:24:00]  So it was, you know, me, my girlfriend, and Poe hanging out at the casino all night.  And, you know, another circumstance, Ben calls and says, you know, there are animals out front.  Do you want to?  No.  I'll just walk in.  I don't need a security guy with me all the time.  I need when we show up in the morning, outside, right by the front door is fine.  You know, I don't need.  It's kind of weird how it's all changing for us.  Yeah.  We're not used to this.  We're not used to this attention.  Well, I could not appreciate more what you do as far as security goes. 
[00:24:30]  It's fantastic.  There are certain circumstances.  It makes me feel completely safe.  There are times, though, where I feel I'm fine.  And I'll say to you, Poe, I'm fine here.  And you can then have fun the rest of the night, whatever you want to do.  You sure?  You know, I'm positive.  Like, when we were out in L.A., you could have gone with everybody else.  It would have been absolutely fine. 
[00:25:00]  It was just me, my girl, and, you know, we kind of want to hang out at the casino.  I understand and I appreciate the security and everything.  But, you know, there are times, eh, I'm okay.  Well, I spoke with Kenny and I told him that I wanted to rub shoulders with some of the martial artists in the area.  Yeah.  And he said, yeah, sure, no problem, as long as, you know, these guys are going back with us.  And I said, well, I'll find out.  And when I found out that you were staying, I said, okay, I'm taking care of Anthony. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, there will be times where I will say, Poe, I'm okay.  And I'm sure there will be times where you'll say, no, I feel I am needed here for security.  But in certain circumstances, eh, it's all right.  Yesterday, I was fine.  A few listeners at the bar.  I like the way you got rid of that one guy, though, in the circle.  Poe, Anthony's beating around the bush.  He doesn't want you to meet him at where he parks his car.  No, I don't think it's necessary.  That's exactly what he was telling me off air. 
[00:26:00]  I was not.  I was saying it's not necessary.  You said you'd rather go up to seven.  You'd rather just take the walk by yourself and get your head together.  I do like that.  Exactly.  Well, tell him.  Tell him what you were telling me.  In the morning, by the front door, fine.  There you go.  Because as I walk from the car to that, I'm in such a state where I'm just, I want to go back to sleep,  that I kind of just need to get my head together.  Not a problem.  And I could see you down the street, and I could see you, and I feel safe.  I see you down the road, and I'm like, hey. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, because there's no one else around still.  Well, there was one guy standing smoking a cigarette in front of the church one day.  That's over there.  And Poe walked past him and actually gave him kind of a, how you doing?  It scared the shit out of this guy standing there.  Because Poe, very intimidating looking in the morning.  Well, he's dressed like he's in the game Counter-Strike.  Counter-Strike.  It's exactly like, I like the people that photoshopped him into some Counter-Strike pictures.  Yeah, I saw that.  But it's frightening.  And he goes up to the guy and is like, how you doing?  And the guy just kind of stood there with a cigarette in his mouth shaking. 
[00:27:00]  And I tricked Poe today.  Because he's just waiting.  You tricked him?  Yeah, definitely.  Because I saw him from a distance.  He just stares across the street.  He's really good at this, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  And he's just waiting for the cab to pull up.  Uh-huh.  I get a cab across the street, and I run across the street, run right into the building usually, right?  Yeah.  And it's all good, right, Poe?  Absolutely.  Today, I'm just rocking and rolling down the sidewalk on my rollerblades, man.  Spring is here.  Do not be looking for any more cabs, Poe.  Look for a guy on rollerblades. 
[00:27:30]  That's my means of transportation from now on.  Yeah, that's incredible how you go in between cars.  Yeah.  Very powerful.  Well, yeah, I was telling him that I'm one of those idiot skaters.  Extreme!  Extreme!  No pads.  I'm the guy that, I mean, actually, it's happened a few times.  As a matter of fact, Ben's father called Ben one afternoon and goes,  I thought I saw Ope on his rollerblades zigging in and out of traffic on Park Avenue.  Great.  You're the guy who's...  So Ben calls me up.  I'm like, yeah, I was over there, as a matter of fact. 
[00:28:00]  I went to lunch, I went to see my brother who works in that area.  And I go, yeah, that was me.  And Ben goes, well, my father was a little nervous for you because he saw you zigging  and zagging and jumping up on the sidewalk back into the street.  Oh, yeah, dude, I'm dumb.  I'm the guy.  You're the guy they're going to have to have a discussion about whether they should pull  the feeding tube out.  I'm the guy that rollerblades on the streets of Manhattan, yes.  And every once in a while...  I have an Ope and I have an accident on the rollerblades. 
[00:28:30]  Every once in a while, I will grab, you know, the back of a truck, too.  A little skitch?  A little skitch action, so...  Yeah, that's incredible how you do that.  I used to roller skate when I was younger, and I can't do rollerblades.  So I went flying down the sidewalk, had a nice little stop right in front of Poe, said,  good morning, Poe.  This is how I'm going to be arriving to work every morning.  Take note.  And I got Poe this morning because he walked up to the corner.  He walked west.  I was getting worried.  To the corner. 
[00:29:00]  And I was coming from the east side today because I stayed in town, so I walked up.  Well, he came into the studio.  I was reading the newspapers, and he's like, Anthony, where were you?  Yeah, and you were out of breath, like you were running around looking for him, making  sure he wasn't being gang-raped in an alley somewhere.  See, Poe, now, if you were at the door, Poe, because when I pulled up, I was like, where's  Poe?  I'm here at the door.  There's no Poe.  Yeah, I was on 7th Avenue getting worried.  See?  So...  ONA Party Rock!  ONA Party Rock.  ONA Party Rock. 
[00:29:30]  Indeed.  What happened to this part?  To what?  No, this is the brand new one from yesterday.  ONA Party Rock!  Yeah, listen to the crowd of animals.  What a zoo that was.  All right, Poe.  Yeah, we had a great time.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  We'll talk to you a little later.  All right.  We got a guy from Cringe Humor probably pissed off because we didn't get enough points.  Oh, boy.  Flea, what's up?  Hey, what's up, everyone?  Hey.  Well, hello?  Yeah, go ahead, Flea.  Oh, sorry.  Yo, Opie, I met you last Saturday at the Owl Tree. 
[00:30:00]  Do you remember?  Um...  No.  Oh, you don't?  No, you probably didn't make a good enough impression.  Oh, shit.  Because I'm like a Rain Man-ass Anthony.  Yep.  So what's up?  No, I wanted to come in and read the news.  Oh, yeah, I remember you.  You're really...  Yeah, I remember you.  You're really annoying, actually.  Wow.  Oh, thanks.  No, you're like a super fan, which was cool, but then you wouldn't shut up.  This call's going great for you, Flea.  Oh, great.  All right.  So is it okay if I do it next week? 
[00:30:30]  Like, I come and I can just...  What?  You want to come in and do the news?  Yeah, for next Thursday.  Because I emailed you guys, but you guys take forever to read them, so I just decided to call.  Um...  Yeah, you probably should have gotten a hint, but...  You want to come in Thursday?  Yeah.  Hmm.  What?  Yeah, you can come in two weeks.  Two weeks.  Uh, sure.  In two weeks?  Yeah, two...  No, two weeks of vacation.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Damn.  Oh.  Too smart for me.  Um... 
[00:31:00]  Nah, I don't think so, Flea.  Oh, fine.  Thanks.  Actually, we've got a girl coming in today that, uh, is going to do the news topless, Anthony.  Are you kidding?  Jim Norton set this up before he left for West Palm Beach.  He'll be at the improv all weekend long.  Hi, Daddy.  I'm here to read the news.  Great.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Daddy.  That would be the bit.  That really would be.  That son of a bitch.  That would be the bit.  Oh, man, that would be really funny.  Probably would do something like that.  I wouldn't put it past him.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're just, uh, warming up. 
[00:31:30]  It's the O&A show.  Don't forget, we really are going to need your, uh, your help on this one because we  will be away and we've got to promote.  Promote, promote, promote, spread the virus, spread the virus, spread the virus.  Right.  Assault on the media, assault on the media.  Get all that done while we, uh, tan ourselves somewhere.  Actually, I have nowhere to go.  You're screwed.  I'll get into that in a little while.  You had about a year to plan this vacation.  Because I told you a year ago I was doing.  Let's call it six months because we weren't sure we were going to work.  And then when we knew we were working, then yeah. 
[00:32:00]  From that point, I knew exactly when we were going to have a vacation.  Yeah, this was planned before I actually, before we were working.  Well, here's the deal.  I guess we'll get into it now.  So, Mike, I decide I'm going to go to Atlantis.  Yeah.  Very nice place down there in the Bahamas.  I'm going away by myself this year, and I just want to read books, swim, snorkel, drink a little, gamble a little.  All at the same time.  Maybe even do a little scuba diving.  Yeah.  But that's about it.  Work out a little bit if they have a nice gym.  I figured Atlantis is perfect. 
[00:32:30]  Everyone said, yeah, Atlantis, Atlantis, Atlantis, and the Bahamas, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Roll a blade on the sand.  Roll a blade on the sand, sure.  Why not?  Maybe even take up my old pot habit.  Oh, smoke a little ganja?  No, I never really got into the pot.  But maybe just have a toque here and there.  It's been many, many years.  Mellow the fuck out for once.  Smoke some Cubans?  Cuban cigars down there?  Nah.  No Cubans.  Whatever.  Just mellow out.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  So I go online.  I call my travel agent.  I go right to the website.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Stupid me forgot that it's Easter week.  A lot of people go away.  Yeah.  It is booked solid.  I'm trying everything possible.  Because now I have my mind set that I want to go there.  I want to go there.  You know?  It's the OCD kicking in, too.  They had nothing available.  Absolutely nothing.  Sometimes you go, all right, I understand you don't have any rooms. 
[00:33:30]  Got any sweets?  I'll take a sweet.  I'll take whatever.  A little something.  A little something.  I want to stay down there for like 10 days.  I mean, I wanted to escape and just get away.  Yeah.  And now I'm screwed.  I don't know.  I think it's going to be like this on every island now.  Oh.  So Club Soda Kenny's working on it for me.  For his travel agent.  And hopefully they'll figure something out.  You're going to wind up in Asbury Park.  Oh, my God.  Laying on a blanket right off the boardwalk in Asbury Park.  Dude, this is my whole life, though.  I wait until the last minute on everything. 
[00:34:00]  Last minute guy.  On everything, Mike.  That's you.  Why plan ahead when you can do it last minute?  Well, this time I get screwed.  Should have come on the cruise with me and my family.  No.  I would have had a darn good time.  Actually, I would have had a good time.  Yeah.  You got an opening?  You're crazy.  No, that thing's been booked up forever.  I couldn't even upgrade.  I wanted to upgrade to the room with the piano in it.  Dude, there's got to be someone that you don't really want to hang out with. 
[00:34:30]  And then I could slip into that spot.  Let me think.  Get rid of a cousin or somebody.  No.  Why?  No, I don't really think there's anybody I don't want on this thing.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't read?  Pretty close.  It's family.  You know how family is all.  I'm kind of family?  No.  What kind of family?  You're like Tom Hagen.  Family and all.  But push comes to shove.  All right.  Anyway, as we go to break, yeah, we're going to need your help spreading the virus on this one. 
[00:35:00]  We're going to be live at Bill's Bar doing a live broadcast in Boston, Lansdowne Street, April 11th, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.  That's the East Coast time.  You figure out the math for the rest of the country.  It's opening day up there in Boston, and it's the Yankees and the Red Sox.  So it's going to be a great, great broadcast.  So we need you guys to help get the word out there for us, okay, because we're not going to be able to promote while we're away.  Right.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  What the f*** was that? 
[00:35:30]  I'll beat up a check for you.  What?  Eh, eh.  Oh.  Eh, eh.  Ow. 
[00:36:00]  You're not going to do it.  You're not going to do it.  You're not going to do it.  Okay, watch this.  It's me, baby.  Get out of here, twat.  It's me, baby.  Stupid frigging twat.  This is a turn-off.  This is a turn-off.  Go for the throat.  Let me just show you how serious I am.  Can't you like to suck my ass?  Hit in the coffin.  Howdy, faggot.  You son of a bitch.  I don't know why.  I just did it right.  I just did it right.  Yeah!  O.B. and Anthony. 
[00:36:30]  XM 202.  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Now this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need a little controversy,  because it feels so empty without me.  I said this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need a little controversy,  because it feels so empty without me.  All right.  It's the O.A. virus spreading across America. 
[00:37:00]  Thanks for checking us out today.  Greatly appreciate it.  Kind of just warming up.  We have Bill Burr coming in, sitting in for Jim Norton today.  Hopefully we'll hear from little Jimmy Norton later on in the program.  He's snoozing.  You know how nice the weather is down there?  He's got the life, I'll tell you.  He can do the show whenever he wants.  And then he takes off to all these cool places and does comedy, and then he comes back. 
[00:37:30]  It's great.  Although I was watching TV in the hotel, Opie.  Big plasma TV they have there at the Four Seasons.  And I was watching the weather, and I saw Miami area, major, like, thunderstorms and really sick weather,  and all I was thinking is Jimmy flying into there.  So I'm going to want to hear his take on his flight in, because I heard it was really supposed to be really bad.  Well, Ben just handed me a note.  Jim will be calling in at 8.30. 
[00:38:00]  8.30 we can expect a Jimmy call?  Yeah.  And then I was watching the Discovery Channel, or one of those goddamn channels.  It would be a National Geographic channel.  And they have this show that I love, but I hate.  I love it, hate it.  Same time, because I'm very interested in it.  It's the air disasters.  It's a show like Seconds to Disaster, or one of those things.  And they take you through an airliner crash.  And they use computer animations. 
[00:38:30]  They use cockpit recordings and reenactments of what's going on in the cockpit and the cab. </pre>
