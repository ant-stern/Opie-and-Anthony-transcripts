<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – engaging in sarcastic self-deprecation, referencing their history of controversy and FCC violations.  They briefly mocked the public's overreaction to a light snowfall before launching into a lengthy discussion about Howard Stern's lawsuit against SiriusXM.  This segment involved detailed complaints about pay disparities and past conflicts with management, specifically mentioning Scott Greenstein. They speculated on the lawsuit's motivations and potential consequences for the company.  The conversation unexpectedly shifted to a scathing critique of Steve Martin's banjo music, only to be surprised by its unexpectedly high sales on Amazon and brief Billboard chart presence.  This was followed by a segment featuring a viral Honey Badger video. The show then turned to a discussion of Lawrence Taylor's legal troubles, expressing skepticism about the claims made by Gloria Allred, his accuser's lawyer.  This led to a satirical and vulgar commentary on various women's causes, culminating in a humorous exchange about "saving Congo clits."  Throughout this initial segment, there was constant sarcastic banter with producer E-Rock, who seemed less than prepared.

The second segment began with a discussion about changing gender roles and the obsolescence of tasks like darning socks, transitioning into a humorous anecdote about a sock ripping during a shower.  This segued into more vulgar criticisms of Gloria Allred's legal tactics.  The hosts then discussed the Japan nuclear crisis and the potential threat to the Indian Point nuclear plant, comparing earthquake risks between the Pacific Rim and the East Coast.  This transitioned into strong criticism of President Obama's perceived weakness in foreign policy, particularly regarding Libya, contrasted with the perceived decisiveness of previous administrations. The conversation further devolved into a discussion of the decline of American cities like Detroit and Camden, attributing their downfall to industrial decline and racial tensions.  This again served as a springboard for renewed criticism of SiriusXM management and Howard Stern’s lawsuit. A caller, David from Israel, offered a differing perspective on Obama's presidency, arguing for prioritizing national interests over public opinion. This sparked further debate about presidential responsibility and public influence. The segment included a humorous, and offensive, discussion of Jewish accents, followed by talk of Jim Norton's television appearances and the hosts’ own careers. The segment concluded with further SiriusXM discussion, birthday shout-outs (including Shaka Khan), and a discussion of bad movie sequels, mentioning *Arthur 2: On the Rocks*.  The segment was rife with vulgar and offensive language and sexually suggestive jokes.

The third segment featured Jim Florentine as a guest in studio. Florentine recounted a harrowing two-day hiking trip gone wrong, detailing their unpreparedness, the hardships encountered (freezing rain, treacherous cliffs, a bear encounter), and their eventual rescue.  This led to a discussion about emergency preparedness, including satellite phones and "go bags."  Florentine then described his elaborate go bag and his plan for escaping a hypothetical New York City apocalypse via boat. Callers shared their own (often unrealistic) apocalypse survival plans.  The conversation included further discussion of preparedness, a humorous tangent about Florentine's pool leak, promotion of Florentine’s work, and a brief mention of Elizabeth Taylor's death, all interspersed with crude jokes and offensive language.


The final segment started with humorous and irreverent reactions to Twitter posts about Elizabeth Taylor's death.  The hosts read and mocked various tweets expressing grief. They also speculated on a sexually suggestive hypothetical afterlife scenario involving Taylor and her ex-husbands. This transitioned into a discussion of Chris Brown's meltdown on *Good Morning America*, with clips played and commentary using highly offensive language to describe Brown's behavior and Robin Roberts' questioning.  Stephen Lang, actor from *Avatar* and *Conan the Barbarian*, was a guest, discussing his experiences filming *Avatar*, maintaining his physique, upcoming projects (*White Irish Drinkers*, *Terranova*, and *Conan the Barbarian*), and personal preferences.  He shared anecdotes from his acting career, including a negative experience filming in Hazard, Kentucky, and a misquote by Larry King.  Lang, the hosts, and Jim Florentine (who was also present) discussed their views on the apocalypse and escape plans.  Florentine promoted his new release and recounted a prank involving a wheelchair and heckler.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense, though.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You're the crazier, the better.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The show.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  How's everyone today?  How's everybody?  They're not answering.  Do you answer?  How are you?  For years, they've never said anything back.  Like, when I say, hi, good morning.  Yes, talking to you.  How are you?  But I want to be like that commercial. 
[00:01:30]  For that commercial for, I think it might be a sleeping.  Morning, early birds.  Oh, you ever see that?  The fake radio chick kind of thing.  And she's like, morning, early birds.  She's all smiling.  Get out of here.  That's not how it works.  There's no smiles.  Especially around here today.  With a big smile.  Wow.  This place is very angry.  Is this place angry? 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  Is this place hurting?  Yes.  There was an angry face on this building when you walked in today.  Mm-mm-mm-mm.  Oh, silly goose.  Feeling great.  There you go.  Someone answering us back.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You represent the audience today, silly goose, in Mineola.  That's great.  Well, what a fine spring morning.  And I say it every time.  I just would love to strap a segment of railroad track all around my vehicle and go on a driving insane rampage and smashing people off the road onto the shoulder. 
[00:02:30]  Because it was snowing.  It was snowing this morning.  There was snow.  Technically, there was snow falling from the sky.  It was the wettest, fluffiest snow you'll ever see.  It was wet.  It was fucking...  The air temperature wasn't even above freezing.  33.  Now, if you take into consideration the temperature yesterday and the day before and stuff, we never broke through freezing. 
[00:03:00]  Mm-mm.  So, the ground, and especially the pavement...  You didn't go outside yesterday, did you?  No.  It was beautiful out.  Well, I went outside to get into my truck.  But it was in the 50s yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gorgeous.  Did you say it never went below freezing?  Yeah, it never went below freezing.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Yesterday.  I'm the asshole.  I'm sorry.  So, the roads are still warm, and snow is not even...  The second it hits, it's gone. 
[00:03:30]  It's water.  Right.  It might as well be raining, is what I'm saying.  Right.  People were driving with their hazard lights on, because they can't fucking drive when snowflakes are coming down,  because they think instantly it's going to be a sheet of ice.  It just is infuriating.  What, did everyone do bad in science class?  I think they did.  You can't figure shit out and go, this is a fluffy wet snow, and then you look down and go, oh, it says 34 degrees right on my car. 
[00:04:00]  Look at your thermometer.  Now, let's see.  Freezing's 32.  The highways are usually a little warmer to begin with, right, Ant?  I know.  You know that.  And, Ope, let me tell you something.  I think the people that are very good at science and mathematics are the worst drivers out there, too.  Enough said, enough said.  Why?  Well, because, you know, there's certain students that do very well in math.  Asians!  Oh, my God.  Look, we beat up everyone today.  We took care of the Asians right off the bat.  They're set.  Enjoy your slam, Asians. 
[00:04:30]  We could have got a lot worse with you.  Oh, hold on a minute.  Yes, yes.  Sirius is coming in to take more money from me.  Hold on a minute.  Wait, what happened?  They need more money.  Hold on a minute.  They need a little more?  Yeah, my wallet's over there.  Just take what you need.  Just have them take it.  Just leave it open.  That's what I did.  I actually just left a spare checkbook here.  Yeah.  And I signed all the checks.  Yeah.  And then I just left it on the table.  It's kind of like Santa Claus.  We just leave our wallets around.  Take what you need in the middle of the night.  That's it.  Whatever you need.  Right.  I'll just say this much. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And I'm talking for myself because Ant gets very nervous.  There's a lot of people really mad today.  Because they haven't had raises in a really, really long time.  Most of our staff hasn't had a raise in, what, four years?  Something like that.  Raise?  When me and Ant signed our last deal, it was truly a shitty deal.  Truly a shitty deal.  But we had no choice.  That's what it came down to.  We had no choice. 
[00:05:30]  Still making a very good living, by the way.  God bless.  Yeah, I'm not going to deny that.  Thank God.  But there's a lot of people that haven't had a raise in a really fucking long time around here.  And as everyone will know by the end of today, Howard is suing this company.  Well, his company is.  Howard Stern's company is.  But that means Howard's suing this company.  It's a technicality.  Yeah.  And I just go back to Scott Greenstein yelling and screaming in my face.  Right.  Because right around negotiations, this place, there was a rumor that there might be a bed 
[00:06:00]  bug problem.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Being a huge fan of Twitter, and I wander around this place with my HD flip and my camera phone,  I saw a memo that I thought was hilarious that was on our office door.  And I don't think it said bed bugs, but it made it sound like we could be fired, like  something was going on.  Yeah.  Don't go in this office.  And I got yelled at and screamed at.  That's not good for the company.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[00:06:30]  You can't just tweet a picture of a memo that says this place might have bed bugs.  That's really bad for this company.  Are you a team player?  I need to know.  Are you a team player?  Team.  No eye.  Just in my fucking face.  No eye.  And I wake up this morning and wonder if Greenstein is going to walk down to the special section  of this floor and ask Howard if he's a team player.  Because certainly, certainly having Howard's face on every channel this morning with big  fucking font graphics.  Howard Stern sues Sirius XM satellite radio. 
[00:07:00]  Like there's no mistaking, there's no mistaking what the story is.  Right.  You know when they say the headline should be the grabber with the who, what, where, when,  all that, all that information?  Yeah.  There's no mistaking what's going on.  When you see Howard, you don't go, hey, I wonder what this story's about.  Yeah.  I want to, I have a question for Greenstein.  Is he going to get in his face today and say, how is this good for the company?  I don't think so.  The stockholders are mad.  They don't want this out there.  I'm talking about myself, you know, all the shit that went down six months ago.  Yeah.  Phone calls and Bob, Bob yelling at me because Greenstein's yelling at him and then Greenstein's 
[00:07:30]  yelling at me, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  What I did was come kind of team.  Oh, there's, there's been plenty of instances where we've been, you know, called on the carpet,  as they say, for certain things.  Yeah.  For example, if we were suing the company, we would not be here right now.  I don't think we have our asses in these seats.  We would not be here.  We would not be sitting here if we all of a sudden filed suit against the company.  Could you see it? 
[00:08:00]  That's classic.  My question to Scott Greenstein, who's real brave and gets real red in the face when he's  screaming at me.  Is he going to knock on the, I'm sorry I use this word, Ed, the compound that is the Howard  Stern area?  Yes.  On this side of the building.  The other side of the building, yes.  Are you going to march in there and go, you know, this is really bad for the company  that your face is on every news channel this morning?  Because remember, when I tweeted a dumb picture of a memo that said that this place possibly  has bed bugs, you were in my fucking face. 
[00:08:30]  It actually held it against me and said that maybe we would have made a little extra more  if I didn't do that.  Yeah.  That was told to me, by the way.  Sue everyone.  The punitive damages here that you're giving me.  And people...  I was very hurt.  My feelings were hurt.  And my shoes fell off.  And I sue everyone.  Is it punitive?  Punitive damages here.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. 
[00:09:00]  My head was bashed apart, Robin.  Yeah.  Look, we're still making good money, but these people walking around right now, they got  to be livid.  They got to be livid.  And this is my opinion on the whole thing, because as I was walking in, everybody was  asking for my opinion, Ed.  So might as well tell the masses.  You know, if this is part of Howard's deal, then I have no problem with Howard Stern, believe it or not.  Yeah.  He makes a shitload of money, but it looks like there might be some money owed to him that is part of his contract. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And if that's the case.  That's the case.  I don't know what it is, but yeah.  Because there's a bunch of people that are really mad at Howard, like how much money does this motherfucker need?  Look, if it's part of his deal, it's part of his deal.  I don't know the ins and outs of the whole thing, but I know if I had a contract that said I was supposed to get a certain amount of money or stock or anything like that, and then I felt that I was not getting it, I would absolutely go to them and say, I want this. 
[00:10:00]  And then if they said no, you would have to litigate to try to figure it out.  So I don't think my beef is with him.  No.  But the fact is, I don't know what the deal is with the company's side.  I haven't heard any of that.  I don't know if it truly is in his deal, because we aren't privy to such things.  No.  Yeah, absolutely.  We know that.  We don't know what his contract's about.  You're right. 
[00:10:30]  He's tearing the ass out of me.  But now us talking about this will be in trouble.  Of course.  Even though Howard's face has been on.  I've seen it 12 times already.  I'm keeping track.  I'm keeping track.  Where it just shows him and says, suing SiriusXM.  How's that good for the company?  Because we've been told that a million times in our careers.  But I don't think we've ever been on TV with the letters, suing, and then put the company we're working for to talk. 
[00:11:00]  Suing the company you're working for, and then you're still there.  Look, here's the deal.  I mean, the place, SiriusXM, decided a long time ago that this place is all about one guy.  That's what they decided.  I'm not even going to comment if it's right or wrong.  They decided that.  Right.  Okay?  So, you know, good luck to you.  Have fun with that.  Keep up your good nature.  They wanted to pay one guy a shitload of money and pretty much have everyone else work for minimum wage.  It was pretty much banking the entire company on one guy. 
[00:11:30]  One guy.  It's like, we're going to bank the entire company.  We're going to, this is one guy.  He's the guy.  We're going to, if the company sinks or swims based on this one guy.  And now.  That was their strategy.  Right.  And then they're surprised when the one guy turns around and bites them.  Right.  Right.  So, you know, XM's philosophy at the time wasn't that.  You know, they'd spread it across the board.  No, no.  That's why.  They had a lot of things going on.  And they paid a bunch of, you know, talented radio guys, you know, reasonable money. 
[00:12:00]  Reasonable.  You always want more, no matter what you do for a living, you know, but the fact is, just  so everyone knows, me and Ant make pennies compared to Howard.  That is a fact.  So when the merger.  I'm not crying poverty, but we make pennies compared to Howard, and I swear to you, our  audience is not that far behind his.  No, not at all.  And that's why it's infuriating to walk in here every day and have to look at that, you  know, that guy, I'll just say, wow, did I almost say something down the hall.  I would love to know if he's banging on that door today and yelling and screaming in his 
[00:12:30]  face saying this is not good for the company, because he is technically the guy that's in  charge of everybody in programming, right?  Yeah, supposed to be.  What were you going to say, Ant?  I'm sorry.  No, I forgot.  Anyway, I was just reading that.  This is one thing that...  This is where you're getting the most of the meat of this, I think.  Let me read this one.  Let me say...  Right?  I'm thinking of it before.  I could sum this up without really saying much. 
[00:13:00]  Basically, all the ones that were over there, what are over here now?  They're over here now.  So, he wants to get paid because everybody's over here now.  Oh, so it looks like he has a bonus structure.  What's that?  Because they didn't offer us any type of bonus.  For the first time in our careers, we didn't get a bonus.  We got a bonus.  What was our bonus?  That if we didn't bring in subscribers, we would be fired. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, really?  That's pretty much it.  Our bonus was, if you don't get in here at 4.30 in the morning and sign your fucking contract,  you could kiss this place goodbye.  Oh, my lord.  That's what I got.  No bonus structure whatsoever.  Because why do that to a show that's doing exactly what they were brought on to do?  But he's got some kind of bonus structure based on subscribers.  So, when the company merged, now the XM subscribers should be under his bonus structure. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And if that's the case, this company owes him a shitload more money.  Let me think about that for a minute.  Now, when you absorb a company, you absorb the pluses and the minuses, the liabilities and the assets.  So, let me think.  Yeah, well, they can't really tell who's subscribing for what, so he just gets it across the board.  Like, if they all of a sudden got another 10 million subscribers just because of the merger. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  The complete acquisition, by the way, not merger.  The fucking absorption of XM.  Oh, it was an absorption.  I think we're the only ones left from XM.  Yeah, I think so.  In this building.  Anyone else work for XM that is in this building?  I saw Bob Edwards himself last week.  Wow.  But he doesn't, he was just visiting from Washington, right?  And Wickland, I see him sometimes.  Yeah, but they brought a whole bunch of managers in from XM because they had to for the merger.  And most of those guys have either left on their own or they're just gone. 
[00:15:00]  See, here's what happened.  Here's what happened.  The XM people were there, right?  Which, by the way, can I, sorry, Ant, because a lot of guys lost really good jobs.  Those guys were really talented.  Yeah.  And I haven't seen, I haven't seen talent that comes close to the guys they decided they didn't need after the merger.  That has to be said for all the people that we lost in the last two years.  Sorry.  I'll shut the fuck up.  No, it was, I was just doing a bit, actually. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, you were?  Yeah.  Can you put up the bit fucking paddle?  It was a bit.  I'm sorry.  It was just that the XM people.  Sorry.  But then the serious people came in and they did so much fucking, they changed the whole look at XM.  Money became no money.  Bonuses became no bonuses.  Your old, old, old employer got fucked over by Sirius. 
[00:16:00]  Yes, Sirius.  And now, now tell me, am I lying?  They did so much fucking.  Shit.  Wow.  Very good.  I interrupted that.  I'm an asshole.  Nah.  I'm an asshole.  It just sounded like I was going into something. 
[00:16:30]  It sounded like you were going to, yeah, do some real shit.  By the way, Bob Edwards was interviewing people in the dark and thought it was funny.  No, we thought it was funny.  Like, he probably didn't think it was funny, but all of a sudden we were going somewhere.  We're walking together and we see Bob Edwards and we notice that he's in the fishbowl and he's interviewing.  Who was it, Eric?  Steve Martin?  Steve Martin.  Steve Martin.  With the lights off.  Dog tongue, the lights on.  I do not like the light. 
[00:17:00]  So just to add to our, wait, Steve Martin decided to do NPR instead of like a high profile show.  That makes total sense.  It's not even NPR.  It's like the fake NPR.  Yeah, that makes total sense.  I don't know the details.  Steve Martin's a cunt.  Enough with Steve Martin, the jackass.  And I hear he's like, he's doing interviews and he's, I'm on fire today, brother.  What's he doing?  If I make it to 10, I'll be really surprised.  I'm just letting you know now.  He's making the rounds with his stupid banjo.  That was years ago. 
[00:17:30]  And he doesn't want to really talk comedy.  Well, good thing.  Who the fuck is going to buy your banjo album, you idiot?  I haven't heard him talk comedy in years anyway.  Can we hear a song from his dumb banjo album?  Oh, no.  What's wrong with these guys?  Well, you know who else has a fun album coming out?  Who?  Pearl Jam himself.  Eddie Vedder.  Don't make fun of Eddie Vedder.  He has his ukulele songs coming out.  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  He's not doing ukulele.  Does he just sit there and think, how could I best fuck with people's minds? 
[00:18:00]  He's bored.  Again, it's not.  And this is what I've heard from resident Pearl Jam aficionado himself, Travis Taft.  He said, look, this is not Pearl Jam.  It's just Eddie Vedder, some solo stuff.  Tip-toe through the tulips, through the garden, where the Vedder every day, tip-toe through  the tulips with me.  We have the new single.  You want to hear it?  It's great.  Is it really ukulele?  No, he's not.  He's doing a whole ukulele album.  It's awesome.  The ukulele sucks.  Fuck the ukulele.  I've never heard a ukulele that was good. 
[00:18:30]  And I love Eddie Vedder.  And I know you're a big Pearl Jam fan.  No, it's really good.  And I know that Eddie Vedder's bored because he's been singing the same songs for over 20  years now in concert.  He tries to mix it up a little bit by throwing in a Who song or something, Ant, but...  Tiny Bubbles!  Wow, you found it.  You came up with a second ukulele song?  No, someone else did, and I looked.  We should get a raise just for that, that you know more than one ukulele song.  Tiny Bubbles!  Well, they blow around like bubbles! 
[00:19:00]  What are we doing?  We doing Eddie Vedder ukulele?  Yeah, I don't hear Eddie Vedder ukulele.  And where's that Steve Martin crap?  This is Eddie Vedder.  This is great.  I'm so glad he rocks a listener.  Oh, now he's upset.  I'm falling harder than I've ever felt before.  I'm falling fast while hoping I'll land in your arms. 
[00:19:30]  Cause all my time is spent here longing to belong to you.  Look, I'm going to do this for everybody else because I own this button.  Boo!  But that doesn't make me feel good today because I'm a big Eddie Vedder fan.  I like his voice.  We'll go see him.  He's going to do a solo to it.  You want to go?  Yeah, I would. 
[00:20:00]  Wow.  Is he going to do Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town?  Hey!  Don't turn it down.  Keep playing.  All right.  What is he rock doing?  Go home.  Why would you fade out the song?  I'm not really feeling this.  Oh, yeah, you are.  You just got to listen.  Shut up. 
[00:20:30]  This is going great.  I can't believe you're not doing a little toodly-doo.  You could be...  Oh, my God!  You could be playing with Eddie Vedder.  I don't know the song yet.  Just riff in the background.  Oh, my God!  I don't know the song yet.  Oh, soon it comes. 
[00:21:00]  I've been dreaming, but I've been longing to be long.  I've been dreaming, but I've been longing to be long.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  damn you figured it out i was just riffing along with it a little bit just jamming with a little 
[00:21:30]  eddie vetter and his ukulele see that was good i like his voice i really like his voice when he  slows it down i know when he's screaming do you i like that  I'm all angry.  You're just like everything.  Everything. 
[00:22:00]  I can't wait.  What's your favorite Pearl Jam song?  Song?  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  I don't know.  What if Eddie Vedder did the music for the new 24 movie that's coming out?  Oh, it'd be great.  Would you just cum in your pants at the movie theater?  Next summer, probably, yeah.  Yeah, I bet.  I wouldn't be able to handle myself.  Oh, forget it.  Maybe Rearview Mirror, just because I love that song live.  Yeah, right on, man.  How many times have you seen Pearl Jam?  12?  You've seen Pearl Jam 20 times?  12 or 13 times.  You're like in that crazy person fucking number.  Oh, there are people way crazier.  To me, anybody that sees one band more than 10 times is a crazy person. 
[00:22:30]  Well, no, because Pearl Jam mixes it up.  Do they?  Yeah, they really do.  It's different every time.  It's different every time.  It's kind of like the Allman Brothers.  They riff and go off on little things and stuff that makes it worthwhile.  I'm serious.  They're doing a whole festival.  I'd love to beat up Travis with you, buddy.  A whole festival?  Yeah.  What's it called?  Pearl Jam 20.  Pearl Jam-a-palooza?  Yeah.  They've been around 20 years?  Yeah.  You know that I've never seen Pearl Jam?  You have to go.  Three of my favorite all-time bands I've never seen.  Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana.  Three biggies in my life. 
[00:23:00]  Well, you can only see one.  I better hurry.  There's only one left.  I know.  I've never seen any of those bands.  You've got to go see Pearl Jam.  And I've been to hundreds of concerts, but for some reason it never worked out with those  guys.  Yeah.  Those three bands.  I don't know why.  You ever see Alice?  Never saw Alice in Chains.  You saw Pearl Jam.  I know that.  I saw Pearl Jam.  Look.  How is this good for the company?  I'm going to say it every time it pops on TV.  Hey, Scott.  How is this good for the company?  It says Howard Stern.  Remember when you busted my balls?  Howard Stern suing SiriusXF.  How is that good for the company?  But, Opie, what's the story about? 
[00:23:30]  We don't have the volume up, so it's very hard to see what the story is.  We're doing some of that this morning, but, yeah, Howard Stern's still on the air until  2015, by the way, with his new contract.  We know his first contract was half a billion bucks.  Not a bad deal if you can get it.  How's Wall Street looking?  How is Wall Street looking?  Yeah, how's that good for the company, sir?  How's our futures?  NASDAQ up?  With all due respect, how's that good for the company?  Fair is fair, right?  Tweeting a memo about bed bugs was really bad for the company.  Bugs! 
[00:24:00]  Hey, we got the Steve Martin thing.  Oh, we do?  Yeah, him and his...  His banjo?  How about...  Are you asleep today?  I think someone's asleep at the switch.  Hey, we got some Steve Martin.  Bang, bang, bang.  Can we set it up a little bit?  I'm going to the left hander.  Get him the fuck out of there.  Oh, shit.  I don't have any patience for him today.  Oh, shit.  The bullpen.  Why aren't you awake yet?  What were you doing last night that you're not awake?  I am awake.  How are you awake?  We didn't even set it up yet.  Why isn't Sam not in today? 
[00:24:30]  I wonder why he's not running down with that smile on his face every time.  He's just laughing at himself.  Oh, okay.  What were you doing?  Here he comes.  What were you doing all night that you're kind of sleepy today?  Nothing.  I did nothing last night.  How many hours of sleep did you get?  Five?  Your voice sounds a little...  No, you're out of it today.  I can tell.  You can tell?  Yeah, I'm razor sharp today.  Trust me.  I can tell.  E-Rock, what happened?  We were setting up the big thing and you hit the music.  And then you just start playing it.  What were you thinking there? 
[00:25:00]  Do you even realize you did that?  Just trying to get into your mind.  I realized I did that.  When you said, oh, we have the Steve Martin thing.  And then you faded out Eddie Vedder for no reason.  It made no sense to just fade it where you did.  What?  Suddenly.  Maybe I'm not razor sharp today.  I love that one.  I just haven't heard it in so long.  I think Anthony's razor sharp.  I napped and I stayed up late.  I'm almost razor sharp.  That's pretty much what I did.  I'm almost razor sharp.  I spent eight hours re-fucking booting my tricester. 
[00:25:30]  All of a sudden, someone from management appears and offers no support for the radio program.  They just seem to try and be justifying their jobs.  But that doesn't stop this radio show.  That's right.  Well, that one sort of makes sense.  All right.  Out of nowhere, a nagel appears.  Uh-oh.  The show swerves to avoid it, but there's no hope.  The nagel is just too big and has made too many mistakes.  Whoa.  You see that?  The most scramble to get a hold of the situation.  Sam.  Sam, you always know what's going on around here.  Sam. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  By the way, when was the last time you got a raise?  A significant raise was...  Like a real raise, not a cute raise.  Cute raise.  Exactly.  What do you got on E-Rock today?  Well, I mean, he's flustered.  What's the scuttlebutt on E-Rock?  He's very flustered.  Because you started...  He doesn't do well with tasks first thing.  Oh.  All right.  Oh, he assumes that we're just going to kind of chill the first hour.  Right.  And that gives him an opportunity to wake the fuck up.  But because we're razor sharp today and jumped right into our show, he's way the fuck behind us. 
[00:26:30]  Especially because he gets here like 5.53.  So it's like, you know, you don't have time.  Oh, no.  You can't ease into the day.  Is that what time...  See, I'm not really up on when everybody gets here.  What time...  Does everybody get here at like 5.53?  No, no, no.  I get here between quarter to five and five.  Oh!  So that...  As well as...  I mean, and then Travis gets here about the same time.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So you're fine with him showing up at 5.53.  This is... 
[00:27:00]  I mean, he's kind of my, you know, superior.  I wouldn't be disrespectful.  So there's still a four in the time number when you're here.  When I scan my card...  Four, four, five.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's just four something.  And then there's a five when E-Rod comes.  Actually, two fives.  Five and then a 50.  Sometimes three.  And then a three.  Sometimes three fives.  I mean, yeah.  There have been...  Sometimes it's four, depending on what month it is.  It'll be times where I will have been here for over 60 minutes. 
[00:27:30]  Really?  Sure.  Something like that.  Something like that could occur.  All right.  But no, I just say because...  But that's because you're not...  You don't have the skill set that E-Rod has.  Yeah, he's probably more organized with his time.  E-Rod can do the same type of job in seven minutes that you do in an hour.  Really?  Yes, he can, sir.  Okay.  So, yeah, you're looking at a man that can really economize with his time.  Because then you asked him for the Friday song before the show started.  Uh-oh.  And he's not...  He had to rush around to find it, and he couldn't find it.  Is that a task, one of the things he doesn't do well with in the morning of the task? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, he's tasking with something.  Then he's looking through all his CD piles.  He couldn't find it.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I mean, you know, had to burn him another one, and then he had to run it up here.  And so now it's like, yes, I'm already to do three or four things.  Speaking of pieces of shit, we were just...  No, no, I was saying we were looking at the Best Buy starts taking advance orders for  RIM's playbook tablet.  How about an edge-to-edge screen, motherfuckers?  There's like an inch around it.  Yeah, why would they do that? 
[00:28:30]  That is all just black nothingness.  No one wants that.  That's the iPad killer.  Well, it is.  We know that, but...  You gotta, like, hook up your phone to it to get email?  Yeah, to get email and...  What a clusterfucker.  Wait, my iPad has a border?  Oh, but look how big it is.  The screen's bigger, though.  Oh.  There's all goods in there.  Cut it in half and keep the same border.  Right.  Oh, I see.  All right.  Are we ready for the Steve Martin song?  I don't know.  Now he's getting frustrated.  He doesn't know when to hit the button, either. 
[00:29:00]  Because he feels like you guys are picking on him.  We're not picking on him.  He's behind today.  Everyone sees it.  Maybe he'll tell us why.  I like being able to watch him on the TV here.  That's a great view.  He can't come in at 5.53 and assume that he's wide awake and ready to go.  I feel like I'm watching a live-action Simpsons, and that's Homer in the reactor.  Maybe he works out in the mornings, and that's why he comes late.  Let's make this...  Oh, but now you're really just being mean, right? 
[00:29:30]  What do you mean?  That's what people do, right?  Oh, no.  Iraq, we should allow you to comment on this whole situation.  Iraq, comment.  100% right.  All right.  He works out.  There's a man.  Oh, it's very visual.  We got the picture of Homer.  Homer is behind the...  And he's got like a little board in front of him.  The board, the console, and he's got both his hands on his head, and he's looking like,  I don't know what to do. 
[00:30:00]  Iraq, you can see the humor in all this, right?  Right?  Sure.  Iraq, you're a big Simpsons fan.  Could you do the Homer pose for everybody?  I can't see it.  He's got like his hands on his head.  The famous shot of Homer with his hands on his head.  See, that looks like you're on the board.  Oh, we need a picture of that.  Someone's got to get a picture of that and put both of those together.  That's classic.  Ah, right on.  All right.  So here's Steve Martin.  Yes, here's Steve Martin.  I guess he's doing banjo. 
[00:30:30]  He really thinks that people are going to give a fuck about his stupid banjo, and he won't  do any real radio shows.  How do you think he's...  Because he wants to focus on this instead of maybe making jokes.  Also, by the way, one of the worst Twitters to follow.  He's off?  I don't follow him.  He sucks on Twitter.  Is he...  Does he think this is going to sell?  This is his second album.  A second banjo album?  Yeah.  How'd the first one do? 
[00:31:00]  In terms of banjo albums?  Probably pretty well.  I don't think that's it.  Like finance.  I would love to know how it did.  Is it the number one banjo album of all time?  It's got to be.  I mean, how many are there?  I don't know, man.  I think it did fairly well.  Does he sing, too?  I don't know.  Well, let's listen to Steve Martin.  What's the name of his banjo album?  Banjo.  It'd be good if it was just called Banjo.  I think this one has birds in the title. 
[00:31:30]  It's called Banjo's Down There.  The Crow.  The Crow?  The Crow.  It's a movie, Eric.  Why is it called The Crow?  This is the only banjo album of Steve Martin's that's showing up in here.  Oh, really?  There's like 12 tracks.  What's the name of this song?  Daddy played the banjo.  Yeah, we've played this song before.  We've played this before?  Yeah, we played this like last year when he came out with it.  How is that possible if the album just came out?  No, no, I think the one that Eric's going to play is from the old album.  Yeah, because this is the first album.  It's called The Crow. 
[00:32:00]  New songs for the five-string banjo.  The five-string banjo?  Oh, now I think it's good.  Oh, so we don't have the second banjo album in the system yet?  No, this is just the original one we did.  Oh, fuck.  What are some of the other songs off The Crow?  Daddy played the banjo.  Pitkin County Turnaround.  Oh, my God.  Hoedown at Alice's.  Oh, my God.  Featuring Steve Martin on vocals is late for school.  That's featuring Steve Martin on vocals.  The new album is called Rare Bird Alert.  Ah, my God. 
[00:32:30]  Another bird thing?  What is that?  Do you have late for school?  Nope, that one's not in here.  And that's one where he's singing on.  Is it online, maybe?  Don't buy it.  Don't give this fucking twat of money for his stupid banjo album.  I haven't heard this yet, but the last track on his new album?  Yeah.  King Tut.  No way.  Banjo version of King Tut?  You think he did a King Tut banjo?  Oh, God.  Please, no.  Please, no.  Did he do King Tut? 
[00:33:00]  Okay, I found select cuts from Rare Bird Alert, and I found King Tut.  Oh.  Is this the new album?  The banjo King Tut?  All right, let's hear the banjo King Tut.  Let's hear Banjo King Tut.  A little nostalgia.  By Steve Martin.  Oh, God.  This is going to be bad.  Yeah?  Is this live?  Oh, God.  I can't. 
[00:33:30]  If I'd known that line of... 
[00:34:00]  I'll take all my money and bought me a museum, King Tut.  Oh, dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This can't be happening.  Gone in Arizona, moved to Babylonia, King Tut.  Hey.  Like, um.  Like, um.  I hate you. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, that's funny.  I'm funny.  It's over, Johnny.  I was only joking.  This is going great.  Oh, my God.  No fucking way.  No fucking way.  No fucking way.  No fucking way. 
[00:35:00]  Does anybody remember laughter?  Thank you.  Get back.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Oh, you get the solo.  Great.  Great.  This is good stuff, right?  No, it's good.  It's good.  Really, it's good.  Oh.  Ah, it's good stuff.  Look at my name. 
[00:35:30]  Now, when I die, I don't think I'm a nut.  No?  Don't want no fancy funeral, just one like old King Tut.  King Tut.  You look like assholes right now, man.  King Tut.  His sister was his mommy.  Asshole.  Arizona, moved to Babylonia, he was born in Arizona.  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole.  King Tut.  Why would you clap for that?  Well, because they paid money.  They go in there and see him.  Hundreds of dollars, I'm sure.  What's the single off the album? 
[00:36:00]  You got that in the system?  The single?  Jesus Christ, that was awful.  Holy shit.  Painful.  I have no idea what the single is off of this one.  I mean, I have a single on a band.  There's one with Paul McCartney.  You know, they probably have one song they push out there for the one station that might play banjo music.  There's no way there's a single.  There's a song here with Paul McCartney called Best Love, if you want to try that.  Is Paul McCartney singing?  I don't know.  It just says Steve Martin and Paul McCartney off the Rare Birds album. 
[00:36:30]  Rare Birds.  Why Rare Birds?  I can't stand him.  Rare Bird Alert.  Rare Bird Alert.  Why Rare Birds?  Maybe he's the Rare Bird.  Is it?  Yeah.  Everybody going to dance tonight.  Everybody going to be all right.  Ching-a-ching-a-ching with a stupid banjo to make it even better.  Do you want to hear more banjo from Steve Martin?  I just want to hear a little of that.  Okay. 
[00:37:00]  Banjo, worst instrument ever?  Yeah.  Bagpipes, too.  You don't like bagpipes?  Nah.  Bagpipes are great.  Some of the guys can rock the bagpipes.  Some of the guys can rock it, though, Ant.  Yeah, but there's nothing you can do with a banjo.  It's just...  Things were nice in California.  Loved our trip out to the coast.  What? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, my God.  No way.  That's overall.  Wait, what?  Wait, stop this song.  No way.  That's on Amazon.  First of all, you can't beat up Paul McCarty's voice ever.  Nah, he just sounds good.  Yeah.  What is this?  What did you find?  I've clicked over to Amazon because I wanted to buy Steve Martin's Rare Bird Alert for my  iPod.  Yeah.  And I notice here that Steve Martin's Rare Bird Alert is number two bestseller in music, 
[00:38:00]  folks.  No.  In all music.  Yeah, well, it was number one in bluegrass, and I'm like, well, it's got to be number  zillion in all music.  But no, number two.  You're sure you're in the all music category?  Bestsellers in music.  Should I do it again?  I'll just stop from the homepage.  No, no, no.  I believe you.  Give me the top ten.  All right.  You got Adele, I guess that is.  Adele is number one.  Who the fuck is she?  Who is Adele?  She's popular.  Then you got Steve Martin.  Steve Martin.  Steve Martin.  And then Jennifer Hudson.  Jennifer Hudson.  He's beating out Jennifer Hudson with his banjo album. 
[00:38:30]  Duran Duran.  Duran Duran.  Chris Brown.  Chris Brown.  Chris Brown is an asshole.  Green Day.  Mumford and Sons.  Strokes.  Radiohead.  Radiohead.  Adam Lambert.  No.  Glee.  Get the fuck out of here.  Fucking Steve Martin's number two with a banjo album.  I know nothing.  I've lost faith in my knowledge of everything on earth.  He's beating out all.  Everything except that one broad.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Holy God, no.  He's beating out Radiohead.  He's beating out Jennifer Hudson.  20 days in the top 100.  Get the fuck out of here.  Do people think it's comedy?  Maybe I should check Billboard.  Yeah, check Billboard.  I can't.  I think it's because he got Paul McCartney.  I can't fathom this.  What do we know?  He's still an asshole, though.  I'm losing.  Let's not forget.  I'm losing my mind.  Wow, man.  People will just buy shit.  Why would they buy that?  Why would they buy it to the point it's beating out Jennifer Hudson? 
[00:39:30]  I don't.  Jennifer Hudson and her pancake tits.  Stop with her being hot.  I was one of those guys, but I turned the corner when I saw her move.  She pushes those things up.  Now, Billboard's a different story, huh?  Well, let's see the Billboard.  Billboard's a different story.  Billboard doesn't fuck around.  What do we got?  Exactly.  Keep going.  Keep going down.  That's right.  I was starting.  This might not be updated, though, because I think it just came out last week. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, God.  You're a buzzkill.  I don't know.  Nah, I'm just defending Steve Martin.  It's freaking me out.  Why would you defend Steve Martin?  I would honestly, I would rather have Steve Martin a number two than some shitty pop album.  Do people think they were buying Angry Birds?  Maybe.  Maybe they thought they were buying the app or something.  I don't know.  I can't fathom that.  It's freaking me out.  He's not even up on the top fucking 50 now.  Well, you know what, though?  That kind of leads me to believe that Travis might be right, because it doesn't take a lot  to chart anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  So he should have. 
[00:40:30]  What?  You don't think it's updated?  Probably not updated.  He'll probably debut at number one.  I mean, if he sold 25 albums, it's going to show up on the Billboard Top 200, so.  I'm stupefied.  Oh, here we go.  Bobby in Alabama.  Hey, Bobby.  Bobby.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Steve Martin played on that Foggy Mountain Breakdown, which is like the best banjo song ever.  Well, that is true.  Do you know the song?  Yeah, I remember going to the depot out there in California when I was a kid, and there was 
[00:41:00]  kind of a couple of banjo plays, and they would play this Foggy Mountain Breakdown or  something?  Yeah.  I think the number one song is the mongoloid that played the banjo in Nam.  Everyone knows Foggy Mountain Breakdown.  No, really?  Everyone knows that song.  And by the way, you got an ACDC fan defending the bagpipe.  Let's not forget Long Way to the Top.  Oh, right.  You got some good bagpipe in there.  So, well, I want to hear the song that you say everyone knows.  Everyone knows. 
[00:41:30]  Guaranteed.  Even if it's not Steve Martin, just punch up Foggy Mountain Breakdown banjo, and yeah,  you'll know it.  You'll definitely know it.  Bonnie and Clyde.  This is Bonnie and Clyde, I think, during the...  Yee-hoo!  This is like...  Black people never want to hear this song close to them.  If, like, a black guy's walking through the woods, and he starts hearing this, like, in 
[00:42:00]  the distance, way in the distance, it's like, aw, shit.  Get the fuck out of there.  Maybe in a pickup truck?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With tinted windows?  Yeah, just get the fuck out of there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know this.  Yee-hoo!  More importantly, someone has a comment about E-Rock.  Oh?  Todd of Missouri, you can turn that down there, E-Rock.  He doesn't want to turn it down.  Yeah, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  We're trying to figure out why E-Rock's a little off today. 
[00:42:30]  You got something?  Yeah, I think he might have been up all night on YouTube watching his brother, the Honey  Badger, eat, and eat, and eat, and eat.  This is the E-Rock.  He just doesn't give a shit.  The E-Rock doesn't give a shit.  Look at Sam and Danny.  They do all the work, and they say, thanks, stupid.  Oh.  He eats, and eats, and eats, and eats.  And there he goes.  Look, he's eating pizza.  Can we find the Honey Badger?  We have to play that.  The Honey Badger.  We should have tweeted this weeks ago, this fucking video. 
[00:43:00]  It doesn't make you laugh at it.  Yeah, yeah, there's something about it that's just funny.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah.  It's on our Facebook page.  It's his delivery.  It's on the Facebook page, Opie and Anthony?  That's good.  Good news.  Thank you, sir.  We can go to break with the Honey Badger one more time.  We'll play the whole fucking thing, too.  You don't need the visual.  I know.  It's an over-the-top, what I would assume, gay guy talking about nature.  It's a nature film narrated by, you know, instead of the usual narrator, you have a  gay guy narrating it.  And in this clip, he talks about the Honey Badger. 
[00:43:30]  A lot of Honey Badger clips in this.  The Honey Badger.  Okay.  Whoa, what happened?  Well, I guess that's the original.  Oh, really?  Ah, that was the actual narrator.  Your humble narrator.  Oh, not gay guy, Honey Badger.  Oh, no.  Search by, uh...  Go to our, uh...  If it's on our Facebook page, no?  Yeah, I mean, we can...  Yeah.  All right.  It's on.  All right, here.  That's funny.  That's the slow-ass sloth. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, the slow-ass, uh...  There we go.  This is the Honey Badger.  Watch it run in slow motion.  It's pretty badass.  Look.  It runs all over the place.  Whoa, watch out, says that bird.  Ew, it's got a snake.  Oh, it's chasing a jackal.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, the Honey Badgers are just crazy.  The Honey Badger has been referred to by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most fearless animal in all of the animal kingdom.  It really doesn't give a shit.  If it's hungry, it's hungry.  Ew, what's that in its mouth? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, it's got a cobra.  Oh, it runs backwards.  Now, watch this.  Look, a snake's up in the tree.  Honey Badger don't care.  Honey Badger don't give a shit.  It just takes what it wants.  Whenever it's hungry, it just...  Ew, and it eats snakes?  Oh, my God.  Watch it dig.  Look at that digging.  The Honey Badger is really pretty badass.  They have no regard for any other animal whatsoever.  Look, and it's just grunting and...  Ew, eating snakes?  Ew, what's that, a mouse?  Oh, that's nasty.  Oh, they're so nasty. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, look, it's chasing things and eating them.  The Honey Badgers have a fairly long body, but a distinctly thick set, broad shoulders, and, you know, their skin is loose,  allowing them to move about freely.  And they twist around.  Now, look, here's a house full of bees.  You think the Honey Badger cares?  It doesn't give a shit.  It goes right into the house to bees to get some larva.  How disgusting is that?  It eats larva.  Ew, that's so nasty.  But look, the Honey Badger doesn't care. 
[00:45:30]  It's getting stung like a thousand times.  It doesn't give a shit.  It just, it's hungry.  It doesn't care about being stung by bees.  Nothing can stop the Honey Badger when it's hungry.  Oh, what a crazy fuck.  Look.  Ew, it's eating larva.  That's disgusting.  There it is, running in slow motion again.  See?  Now, what's interesting is that other animals, like these birds here, they just like to wait  around until the Honey Badger's done eating, and then it swoops in to pick up the scraps.  It says, you do all the work for us, Honey Badger, and we'll just eat whatever you find. 
[00:46:00]  How's that?  What do you say, stupid?  Look at this bird.  Thanks for the treat, stupid.  Hey, come back here, says the Honey Badger.  Birds don't care.  And you know what?  The jackals do it, too.  Look at these little dogs.  They're like, thanks, stupid.  Thanks for the mouse.  See you later.  The Honey Badger does all the work while these other animals just pick up the scraps.  At nighttime, the Honey Badger goes hunting because it's hungry.  Look.  Here comes a fierce battle between a king cobra and a Honey Badger.  I wonder what'll happen. 
[00:46:30]  Look at this.  There's the Honey Badger just eating a mouse.  And then look.  Get away from me, says the snake.  Get away from me.  Honey Badger don't care.  Honey Badger smacks the shit out of it.  And the snake comes back and it lashes right at the Honey Badger.  Oh, little does the Honey Badger know, FYI, it's been stung.  It's been bitten by the snake.  So while it's eating the snake, ew, that's disgusting.  Meanwhile, the poisonous venom is seeping through the Honey Badger's body.  And it passes out.  Look at that sleepy fuck. 
[00:47:00]  Now, the Honey Badger's just gonna pass out for a few minutes.  And then it's gonna get right back up and start eating all over again.  Cause it's a hungry little bastard.  Look at this.  Like nothing happened, the Honey Badger gets right back up and continues eating the cobra.  How disgusting.  And of course, what does the Honey Badger have to eat for the next three weeks?  Cobra, the Honey Badger.  That's 866-969-1969.

[00:48:00]  You got Lawrence Taylor, man.  What a guy that just was getting a whore.  You know, if that's his cup of tea, whatever.  And they send over some whore.  And he pays money and has sex with her.  And then it turns out that she's 16.  And now Gloria Allred is this chick's lawyer.  And she's painting her up as this poor, unfortunate girl that was beaten by the pimp. 
[00:48:30]  And forced to go there and suck LT's cock.  Bullshit!  God damn, I'm calling shenanigans.  Really?  I'm calling shenanigans.  You're taking that side.  Yeah, I'm taking the side that this chick was a prostitute.  A prostitute?  Like she was too young to understand what she was doing.  Yeah, right.  A fucking 16-year-old prostitute.  Believe me, she knows what the fuck she's doing.  I don't want to hear anything about her underprivileged life or any of that whore shit. 
[00:49:00]  Stop.  And LT's just like, hey, whatever.  Now he's on the fucking sexual deviant list.  Well, I have a comment on that.  But shouldn't there be a – there should be degrees of the sex list.  Sex offender, there are.  There's one, two, and three.  Oh, there are.  Yeah.  Yeah, but one, two, and three means nothing.  Shouldn't it be almost sex offender?  Almost sex offender, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  He should be in the almost sex offender category because 16 is now pushing close to legal.  Well, he's level one, I think.  Yeah, but level one, that don't mean nothing to me.  If I saw someone in my neighborhood was an almost sex offender, then I'm thinking, okay, it was a teenager approaching being legal.  Right.  Because to me –  And a prostitute, taboo.  Yeah, because to me, sex offender means – what I'm thinking when they say sex offender, oh, LT did some horrible stuff to a baby. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, went to a fucking nursery school and pulled his cock out or something.  Right.  So I want to suggest almost sex offender for Lawrence Taylor.  Almost sex offender.  He's still a dirtbag, though, man.  He's had a shitty life since –  Oh, yeah, he's a dirtbag.  For a long time now.  I'm not defending him in any way, but I sure as shit ain't defending her either.  She's a fucking – she's a prostitute.  I don't give a fuck.  If you fucking call up a whore and they send up over some chick, what are you supposed to do? 
[00:50:30]  Ask her for proof?  Ask her for fucking, you know, how old are you?  No, you pay her money and you fuck her and that's what happens.  Unless he was looking for something a little different.  I don't know.  Just saying.  I don't even think – you know what?  I don't even think there was any allegations that he said, could you send over a 16-year-old.  Okay.  I think it was just like, send over some fucking whore or whatever.  Something good.  Send over a whore.  And then Gloria Allred.  Yeah, why is she involved with this? 
[00:51:00]  Because she's a fucking kent that just has to get involved in what she believes is women's causes.  Meanwhile, you know, real women's causes she doesn't fucking pay attention to.  She just likes these get-her-name-in-the-news, see-if-she-could-make-a-few-bucks kind of shit.  I can't stand her.  What's a real women's cause?  I don't know.  How about you champion the cause of – I have no idea. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know any women's causes.  I could give a shit about women's causes.  I have no idea.  When we allowed them to vote, that was a very dark day.  Smoke cigarettes.  That's a very dark day for – for guys everywhere.  For dudes.  Yeah, there's plenty of other things she could be doing that I think would be more representative of helping women than hopping on the bandwagon of some prostitute. 
[00:52:00]  How sad are we?  We don't even know one woman's cause.  There's got to be one out there.  Like that needs legal help?  Yeah.  And isn't really there?  Let's really think.  Do we know one woman's cause?  How about Congo clits?  Congo clits is a good one, man.  Clits in the Congo.  That's a good one.  Get over there and help these women hold on to their clitorises.  Can we get t-shirts made?  Save Congo clits.  Save the Congo clits. 
[00:52:30]  Hard to say.  We might need to jazz up that – the saying.  We're going to have to put it through the Charlie Sheen filter.  Oh, the Sheen-o-nator filter?  Yeah.  Because Congo clits.  Save Congo clits.  Yeah.  How are we going to get that in on TV?  Oh, then they'll never take it.  Huh?  They'll never take it for television.  Can we offer it to TV to see what they say?  Pro-choice, Ant?  Hmm.  Well, are you asking me or thinking that would be a good cause for her? 
[00:53:00]  I don't know, Janine.  Be a little more fucking concise.  This isn't Twitter.  You could fucking – you know, you could type out a few more words.  Christ.  What are you, sleepy?  Wow, you're mad too, huh?  Oh, sorry.  Doing my nails.  Well.  Well, that's what broads do.  That's what you broads do, huh?  While we're getting ready to bring home the real money, you broads are getting your nails done.  Well, we're bringing home the bacon.  That's right.  You're cooking it up in a pan. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, and doing your nails.  Actually, they don't even cook it up in a pan anymore, these broads.  No.  They want too much.  Go ahead.  We bring home the bacon, and now it just sits there.  Now we've got to cook it up.  I want you to darn my socks.  When's the last time a woman darned a sock?  I don't even know.  I don't even know what it is.  I'll be honest.  I just laughed there because I know it's funny.  I don't know what that means.  It's an oldie term.  I just know that women took like these tennis ball kind of things, and they'd put them in  the sock when the sock had a hole in it, and they would sew it like that. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, okay.  Because the ball would keep the sock kind of the right shape to sew it, and they'd call  it darning the sock.  Darning the sock.  I don't know why it was darning.  I don't know where that came from.  I remember here.  Or a light bulb they would use.  Oh, look at that.  Some other person saying.  That's crazy.  Yeah, a light bulb.  I just remember hearing it from the Honeymooners.  Doesn't she cook your dinners?  Does she not darn your socks?  Not anymore. 
[00:54:30]  That was Carlos teaching him to mamba.  Not anymore, man.  No.  We bring home the bacon, and it just fucking rots on the counter.  Now you just fucking, you just get new socks.  Yeah.  You ever go to pull your socks up, and you didn't dry off good enough for the shower because  you're in a rush, and you pull your sock, and the whole thing just rips?  It goes, like, the whole top of the sock comes off, and it's just the dumb part of the sock  is sitting on your foot, and you have a garter around your leg.  What's the dumb part of the sock? 
[00:55:00]  It just looks dumb because it's hanging off like a fucking used condom off of your foot,  and the other part because you were trying to get it to come on, but the whole back  just ripped right off.  I hate that.  People want to know how old you are, that you came up with all these weird old terms.  I watched the Honeymooners.  Is that where that comes from?  Yeah, I watched the Honeymooners.  It is a terrific show.  It certainly is.  It's one women's cause.  Wow.  A woman's cause.  It's nothing like the National Organization of Women Get On or Gloria Allred. 
[00:55:30]  There's got to be something that, but they just leave that shit alone.  I don't know.  She's making money on a hooker now that, you know, she's the pimp.  Now you're the pimp, Gloria.  You got a fucking hooker, and now you're going to make some bucks on her while she's turning  what amounts to a trick in a courtroom?  Oh, that's good, Anthony.  And who's paying Gloria? 
[00:56:00]  LT.  She's got to get paid.  How is he paying her?  Oh, guaranteed there will be a civil lawsuit now.  And the pimp.  The pimp is going to get sued.  Everyone's going to get sued.  She's going to make money.  This hooker, this whore, is going to make money.  And Gloria Allred is going to get a percentage of it.  Because she's the mouthpiece, the lawyer.  Yep.  Japan nuclear crisis.  I swear they just had this headline.  Could it happen here? 
[00:56:30]  News has to go local.  They were talking about the Indian Point nuclear power plant here in New York.  And they're saying, like, oh, we got to look over the safety precautions because we don't  want a situation.  It's like, I don't think an earthquake and tsunami are really things that might happen near  the Indian Point nuclear power plant.  You know, there are other unforeseen things, but that's what life is.  Unforeseen shit.  But I don't think we got to worry that an earthquake and tsunami are going to make a  disaster.  Isn't there a fault line close or something? 
[00:57:00]  Those East Coast fault lines are the dumbest fucking things when people go, oh, there's  a fault line.  It's not the Ring of Fire.  The Pacific is very fucking primitive.  It's crazy.  Ring of Fire.  It's crazy.  And they're saying that San Francisco is due because of the Ring of Fire.  Yes.  Did you see that?  Oh, yeah.  See where you got the one in, where was the first one?  That other earthquake or something.  Where was the first one? 
[00:57:30]  One of those, Australia.  Was it Australia?  Yeah, the big one down there in, what do you call it, Australia.  And then, was it Australia?  Yeah.  And then South America?  And then Japan?  It's going around?  Yeah, it's going around.  And now they're saying San Francisco's next.  It's going around.  I don't know about that.  They are due for what they call the big one.  But that's that whole fucking, the plates are moving like a motherfucker over there.  It's all lava and shit.  We ain't got no lava on the East Coast. 
[00:58:00]  No lava.  Maybe if I had some lava.  You know, the TV really scares you with the big ones.  Yeah.  But we just had a big one in Japan, and it sucks and all that, but we survived it.  Japan didn't fall into the sea.  We survived it.  It sucks.  It came to Japan.  It's a mess.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They got some shit to take care of now.  Yeah.  But when you watch these sci-fi shows, and they talk about the big one, they're talking  about like the whole city just sinks.  You see California crack off of the United States and just fall into the ocean. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Is that going to happen?  I don't think so.  I'm going to fix my shit.  You're leaving?  I don't blame you.  I'm out of here.  I don't blame you.  I just get up.  I don't fix the chair.  I hate when it's in all the way.  I noticed the offices down the hall.  Very dark today.  Are they a little empty?  Very dark.  Are people not showing their face?  Very dark.  Is Bob Edwards doing some show prep or something?  I have to go talk to management.  I have to go talk to management.  Dim the lights. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's kind of creepy, but I don't see anything happening here with the nuclear power plant  or earthquakes or tsunamis, to tell you the truth.  I think we're pretty good as far as that goes.  Yeah.  We just got to worry about terrorists.  Terrorists.  They're not done with us.  We're number one target on that list.  Yeah.  They're not done with us.  They're not going to be happy about that whole...  Libya thing.  Libya thing.  And now you got the Yemen guys stepping down. 
[00:59:30]  Got the Yemen president stepping down.  Yemen.  Yeah.  He said, fuck this.  I'm out.  I'm not going to get fucking dragged out of here.  I'll leave first.  So he's leaving at the end of the year.  Another one of those end of the year guys.  End of the year.  He's out.  Wow.  Farrakhan was really fucking pissed at Obama.  He was yelling at him.  Well, that puts you in a quandary, sir.  Yeah.  Who do you dislike more?  Am I going to agree with Farrakhan?  Who do you dislike more?  Let me think.  I don't like either of them.  I know that. 
[01:00:00]  So I'm trying to think...  But I'm forcing you to tell me who you dislike more.  This is a tough one for you, buddy.  I think...  Do you hate Farrakhan?  Farrakhan?  Or Obama more?  Well, I never liked Farrakhan.  But there are some of his ideology that I agree with.  I do.  I agree with certain things that he says.  Obama?  I don't think I agree with anything he says.  Because he's black? 
[01:00:30]  No, because he's just a weak president.  He's a weak president.  He's wishy-washy.  He can't commit to anything.  He...  This whole military thing...  And I've been reading a lot of shit.  People giving me shit like, oh, if it was George Bush, you would have a big hard-on that they were bombing.  It's like, yeah, it's not George Bush.  Here's a guy that ran on the platform of getting out of Iraq and getting out of Afghanistan and closing down Guantanamo. 
[01:01:00]  And now he's involved in a military action that the United States has taken the lead on on an Arab country with the mission being to rid the Libyan people of a tyrannical dictator.  If that doesn't sound like Iraq, that's exactly what happened.  At least George Bush tried to cover it up with those weapons of mass destruction.  But this is like...  And then the whole thing with saying, well, the United States is taking the lead now, but we're going to hand it off to one of our other coalition members, by the way, which is maybe three. 
[01:01:30]  And the other coalition members, especially France and England, are saying, hey, we don't want this.  Hey, you're in charge.  So now we're like, who are we supposed to dump this off on?  If England doesn't want to take the lead and France doesn't want to take the lead, we're kind of now stuck with being the head muckety-mucks here. 
[01:02:00]  And Obama, sorry, not a wartime consiguiere.  I don't see him as being a wartime president.  President, very wishy-washy, very which way the fucking wind's blowing, that's which way he goes, and not really committed to doing things like this.  And I don't think he really knows what he's doing with this situation.  That's my take on it.  There you go.  I have nothing. 
[01:02:30]  I have nothing.  That's just it.  I'll tell you this much, I don't think he wants to be fighting any wars.  No!  Which kind of shows, I don't know.  I think he gets a lot of pressure from other people.  But he doesn't know how to make that stand where he goes, this is what needs to be done, this is what I'm fucking doing.  He's like, kind of got pushed into this.  Do you think the president has that type of power nowadays?  If you're that type of president, you do.  You think?  You need to fucking rack some head in that Oval Office when you're talking to people, and I don't think he does it. 
[01:03:00]  I think he can be pushed around very easily.  But he's a, yeah, well, he's a peace guy.  I don't think he wants us to be in any of these places.  So why are we?  And that makes me think that he doesn't have as much power, or that particular office doesn't have that much power anymore.  The office does.  I think the office does.  You think it does?  I really do think it does.  Like the old days?  With the right president in charge.  When we're fighting the world wars?  Look when you have, whether you agree with it or not, when you had your Bush, your Cheney in there, 
[01:03:30]  they did a lot of shit that people did not like, didn't want done, but it got done.  You know?  Congress didn't want it done.  A lot of people, you know, especially toward the end.  So you think the office still has a lot of power?  I think the office has the power, but I don't think, if the person doesn't know how to wield that power, it's...  Or negotiate around some things. 
[01:04:00]  Like, don't you think the office has lost a lot of power since JFK?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A lot of people think that's, like, the turning point where the president just didn't have as much power as the guys that came before him.  Yeah, because the public opinion started really mattering, and I don't mean public opinion as far as the illegal votes and things like that.  I mean, just the polls.  They started paying attention to all that, and the press really started getting in there.  And I'm not saying this is a bad thing either. 
[01:04:30]  I'm just saying this is the way it was.  The press started getting in there and exposing a lot of things.  And we held up every politician like they were infallible and trustworthy.  And then the press started exposing people.  And then you had Watergate, which made the presidency a complete joke.  And now, you know, you just hope you get a guy in there that is strong.  America, without being the world police, because that's not a good thing.  America has to still be a strong powerhouse in the world. 
[01:05:00]  Its leadership has to be very strong.  And Obama does not have that.  Never has.  Never fucking will.  He's not a foreign policy president.  And he's absolutely not a wartime president.  So if he wants to enact all kinds of social programs and tax the fuck out of everybody and get the deficit up to $5 trillion, that's what he's good at.  But as far as, you know, leading as a strong, powerful American president and showing leadership in the world that is respected in the world, it ain't there. 
[01:05:30]  How many of the trillions is Obama responsible for?  A lot of the trillions.  A lot of the trillions?  A lot of the trillions.  We do know after Obama's gone, the trillions will continue to go up, right?  Well, there were a lot of trillions.  I'll even give Clinton credit.  There was a lot of money in the deficit before Clinton.  And Clinton was able to clean that shit right up.  Had a surplus.  Cleaned up some of that shit.  Had a surplus.  And then GW came in.  And he chalked up quite a fucking deficit. 
[01:06:00]  But you got to look at the situation.  We were fucked.  Nobody was saying, let's not spend money on defense and anti-terrorism and intelligence around the world.  We spent like motherfuckers because our homeland was literally bombed for the first time.  So, yeah, the cost of wars and military actions and stuff like that, yeah, it rang up a hell of a tally. 
[01:06:30]  But to then just build on top of that by trillions of dollars and still blame it on the last guy is ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  You know why I don't like talking politics?  Why so?  And that's why I won't go on Sean Hannity.  You were right when you told him that.  Oh, no.  It's kind of like the Yankees and the Red Sox.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Yeah, you're not changing anyone's mind.  And I just can't argue.  I can't argue with anyone that doesn't want to listen. 
[01:07:00]  That is never going to listen.  And that's why I find it entertaining to watch people do it, and you're certainly very, very good at it.  But it's like if you're a Yankees fan, it's like, all right, march up to Boston and try to convince a Boston Red Sox fan to be a Yankees fan.  It ain't going to happen.  It ain't going to happen.  Do you like the sport of it?  It's a debate.  It's a debate, yeah.  I don't think it's a debate because when I watch all these – I do watch a lot of this shit.  I go from Chris Matthews to Sean Hannity.  I'm all over the place. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, I do a little of the situation room, even though he's more of a situation than debating.  Whatever it is.  His fake situations until recently.  And I just watch people not even listen and then wait for their turn.  Yeah, that's usually what happens.  And that would drive me nuts.  I just like getting my own opinions out there, and it's kind of cool to have forums where you can do that.  When you're on Hannity, you completely understand when he has the lib on with you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You completely understand that she's not going to listen to a word you're saying, right? 
[01:08:00]  No.  And vice versa, right?  No, they just need that foil.  They need the two people going at it.  Right.  If everyone just sits there and agrees with each other, it becomes like, oh, I get it.  So you need that liberal in there with the conservative, the gay guy with the anti-gay guy.  God bless you.  I just can't do it.  I like doing it.  I like being here, but you're like, this is what I'm about.  This is what I believe in.  And this is my point.  And we have the forum here on radio and TV. 
[01:08:30]  What if the two sides work together a little bit?  It can't happen.  Ever, right?  It really can't.  I don't know if it ever really did.  Was there a time it did, you think?  I think a time it worked better.  I think people were a little more into the interest of the country than the interest of themselves, maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe it just looked that way more than actually was that way.  I think it's been bullshit since day one.  Yeah, yeah.  I do.  I think you got a lot of really rich white guys that made believe they were taking care of their fellow men. 
[01:09:00]  Well.  And, you know, they had their own interests.  Yeah, the black guys got their own issues, believe me.  Look at Charlie Rangel, fucking, with impunity, just skips his taxes.  The head of the fucking Ways and Means Committee.  And that motherfucker wasn't paying his taxes, and he skates and wins overwhelmingly in his dumb district with his dumb fucking constituency, voting for his dumb, crooked fucking ass. 
[01:09:30]  Ah!  Ah!  I hate it.  Ah!  And then you got Chicago, which is a wreck, because of that whole, all that Chicago good old fucking little gang that they got over there.  Detroit.  Have you seen what's happening in Detroit?  Lowest population since 1910 or something?  They are leaving like rats, leaving a sinking ship.  I was just reading that.  All that's left there is criminal elements. 
[01:10:00]  Criminal elements!  Well, that just happens to our cities over time.  Why?  No jobs because the automotive industry left Detroit.  Well, that would fuck up a city like Detroit.  That's true.  But you know something?  There was a time when shipping was really important.  If you go down, like, the coast from, like, Buffalo, and then you kind of, you know, go south along the water, there's all these old factories and mills. 
[01:10:30]  And Buffalo was a happening city, but, you know, things turned and changed and pretty much killed that city.  So, see, I'm thinking there are other...  Like Detroit's supposed to survive with the auto industry taking a shit?  So, when one industry dies, instead of, you know, invention and innovation and building up Detroit to be something else, why did Detroit have to be Motor City forever?  Why does it have to be the place that builds cars?  Why can't it have turned into something else and, you know, build fucking windmills? 
[01:11:00]  Do something.  But then, it just turns into this impoverished place where no one gives a shit about the city, the surroundings, each other, where they live, and it becomes a fucking dump.  You're talking about Sirius?  Oh, shit.  I didn't realize that.  I was.  I can answer your question by talking about this company.  Yeah.  Why didn't they do things differently?  They counted on one thing.  One thing, like the automotive industry.  Detroit counted on one thing.  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  And they assumed it was going to be around forever.  So, when that took a shit, of course they're in a bad spot.  Of course they are.  This place is counting on one thing.  One thing.  One thing.  We're not building windmills here at this company, are we?  Building windmills.  That would require some kind of federal aid program.  Something like Obama proposed.  No, dummy.  Shut up.  Look, Zach, let me tell you something.  When invention and industry was happening in the old days, I'll call it, they didn't ask for government handouts to fucking subsidize their shit for the most part. 
[01:12:00]  It was people believing in an idea and investing in it because they felt strongly about it, felt that they would make a positive return on it.  And it was some kind of gizmo or gadget that was good for the country and good for employment.  And it would build cities. 
[01:12:30]  Cities were built around these industries that popped up.  Because we were very crafty, the Americans.  Very clever and could build things and produce and export.  And then it just turned to shit.  And then once one industry died, the whole fucking area died because no one came up with something new.  There's a bunch of cities, we could get a list going, where they just went away because that industry died.  Yeah, the industry died.  And that's what's going to happen to Detroit.  Why would they think of another industry? 
[01:13:00]  Why?  I don't know.  The car thing seemed like something would be around forever and they were doing very well with that.  Yep.  But then everyone left except for people that really aren't building things.  Well, that's when...  They're destroying things.  That's when the zombies take over.  The zombies take over.  Detroit is the closest to becoming...  Zombie invasion.  You're right.  They're the closest.  Closest.  Who's second, you think?  If you're...  Camden. 
[01:13:30]  Camden.  Camden's pretty good.  Yeah, but did they ever have an industry?  Probably years ago.  I bet you they did, though.  What did Camden have?  Because they're right on the river, right?  Years ago.  So they're probably one of those...  I bet you if we looked up Camden...  Yeah.  Please do that, Danny.  I bet you they were a happening little city.  Yeah.  And then whatever industry it was, went away, and that was it.  That's what happens in America.  That's what happens.  I'm telling you, man.  You take a drive, like I said, down the shore, outside of Buffalo, you'll see this shit.  Yeah.  And these towns, these little towns south of Buffalo were happening in the turn of the 
[01:14:00]  century or wherever the fuck.  Industrial history of Camden.  Tell me when Camden was happening.  Well...  And for what reason?  From 1901 through 1929, Camden was headquarters for the Victor Talking Machine Company.  Oh, the Victor!  The old Victrola!  I'm on my way, I'm gonna stay, I'm going Hollywood, what, what, what, what, what.  Is that what would happen?  Yeah, because those things never worked. 
[01:14:30]  Well, it was a start, though.  Yeah.  We had to start somewhere.  But that was...  So that was the headquarters of the Victor...  The Victrola.  Back in the day.  The Victrola.  Sure.  From what year to what year?  That was from 1901 to 29.  That means right around 25, the bottle fell out.  But hang on.  And they try to hang in there for another three or four years.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yes.  Also, from 1899 to 1967, so that's a pretty good run, Camden was home of the New York  Shipbuilding Corporation.  See, that's what I'm talking about. 
[01:15:00]  Shipbuilding Corporation.  That's 70 years.  So you gotta think Camden did really well during that period.  Sure, sure.  I bet you there were a lot of people with a lot of money in Camden.  Probably.  All money bags.  And then we don't need the shipping as much as we used to.  So that area dies.  And why didn't they start thinking of something else then, Ant?  Harumph.  I'm in the head of the New York Shipping Corporation here in Camden.  Harumph.  Harumph.  And then they...  Yeah, they didn't think of anything else?  Well, it says at Camden's peak, there was 10,000 workers employed at RCA with another 40,000 at 
[01:15:30]  the New York Shipbuilders.  So they...  So, and then by 69, I guess all that fell apart.  So since 69, Camden has been losing jobs and residents for a quarter century due in large  part to urban decay, highway construction, and racial tensions.  Wait, what do you mean since 69?  1869?  No, no.  1969?  Wait, what was the shipbuilding?  From what to what?  I got confused.  From 1899.  Oh, it was 1899.  Through 1967.  To 67.  The USS Indianapolis was built there. 
[01:16:00]  So...  Wow, how about that?  So, in the 60s, Ant, that place was still happening.  Yeah, during the Vietnam War, I guess.  And now it's a shithole.  Now it's just a shithole.  Well, racial tensions.  People were proud to live there.  I'm sure, for a while.  Oh, I'm sure they were very proud.  And that's where it's happened.  They'd go to work.  And that's what's happened to Detroit.  They didn't have anything to fall back on.  Yes.  Here it is, the wonder of Camden.  The wonder of Camden, New Jersey.  Look at that. 
[01:16:30]  There goes another ship.  Bound for the Huns in Germany.  Go get them, boys.  And here's the Camden nightlife.  Tripping the light fantastic at the many wonderful clubs full of white people.  Ah, listen to the tunes made in this factory, the RCA Victor factory.  Look at all the people working.  There you go.  Spin the record.  Play a tune.  Let's dance.  Camden.  One of the golden cities of America. 
[01:17:00]  The sparks flying at the shipyard.  Showing that another big ship going out.  To help our boys battle the Japs.  There it goes launching the Indianapolis.  What a wondrous sight here in Camden.  The golden city of Jersey.  Camden.  Isn't it wonderful?  As the years go by, we see Camden is building and building. 
[01:17:30]  It's just an amazing place to live.  Ah, here's a cotillion full of white people dancing and singing in gowns and tuxedos.  Isn't it wonderful?  Oh, uh-oh.  Oh, uh-oh.  Wait, what's this?  I haven't seen one of these before.  Hmm.  I wonder what's, uh, what's happening to lovely Camden.  Well, one factory shut down, but that's okay. 
[01:18:00]  You can guarantee another will pop up in its place in no time.  Hey, what the hell is this?  You said you weren't selling to those people.  Wait a minute.  The house next door to me was sold to, hey, Camden.  You want to go in a time machine and fast forward a little bit?  Let us fast forward a little bit and take a look in our time machine at Camden now.  Struggle, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, my dear lads! 
[01:18:30]  Holy shitcakes!  Get the police!  Get me back to the 30s!  Oh, my God!  You get...  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please call the police.  I am scared of you.  Back to the 30s.  I am safe and light. 
[01:19:00]  I guess they did have some kind of industry.  Yeah.  Ah, boy.  Well, there you go.  The death of a city.  Yeah.  Camden's a perfect example.  Jesus.  People were doing very well there for...  Now you don't want to go.  ...for almost a century.  They had a century of niceness.  Now you never want to go to Camden.  And that's what's happening with Detroit.  And they had nothing to fall back on.  No.  No company that looks...  Really looks at anything to fall back on.  I think racial tension has a lot to do with things, too, because you really don't want 
[01:19:30]  to move a business in where there's, you know, racial tension.  And in the late 60s, early 70s like that?  Oof.  Look out, people.  Oh, wait a minute.  What is this?  Howard Stern, Sue SiriusXM saying promised stock bonuses weren't paid.  Oh, okay.  That's just on Squawk Stories on CNBC's stock thing.  No one that's in business or in the market really watches that.  Yeah, I'm sure Scott Greenstein's fine with that one.  But he certainly wasn't fine when I tweeted a picture of a memo that said that we might 
[01:20:00]  have had bedbugs.  How dare you?  Because he yelled and screamed.  His face got extremely red that day.  And he said, how is that good for the company?  But I'm sure this is fine for the company as they discuss it at length now.  Now they're having a conversation on the premier stock market channel.  I wonder if Scott's going to knock on Howard's door today and yell and scream in his face like  he did mine.  Good job.  Any news is good news.  You think he'll say that?  Right. 
[01:20:30]  And I also wonder if we sued the company, if we would be sitting here today.  No.  Of course not.  We'd be home for sure.  God damn, man.  I don't know.  That's how they decided to run their company.  We're nobodies.  No.  In this world, we're certainly nobodies.  No.  We'll have another world, though.  One of these days.  We'll have another world.  One of these days.  So, oh, we have David in Israel. 
[01:21:00]  David.  My David.  David.  We'd all be dead if it wasn't for my David.  Yes, David.  Good morning, Anto.  How are you?  Yeah.  I hate Obama as much as you do for many reasons.  You call him wishy-washy.  If you do what the people want, and Americans are fed up with us going into wars, and he's  now saying he's not going to stand up and go in there, isn't the president supposed  to do what we want him to do?  So, people are fed up, and he's not going to do it.  If people want us to go in, then he'll go in.  No.  The president is not supposed to do what the people want him to do.  That's a misconception. 
[01:21:30]  The president is supposed to do what's right for the country and what's best for the country.  We elect him thinking, based on his campaign promises, that he's going to do the job we  need him to do.  Because we can't predict what's going to happen to our country and the world.  So, we hope we're putting the best guy in that can deal with a constantly changing environment.  He's not that guy.  We don't put presidents in to do the people's bidding at the drop of a hat, because people 
[01:22:00]  don't agree.  They're always split.  If you do what the people want, it's not going to be 100%.  You're going to be pissing off at least half the people.  So, he's supposed to do the right thing for the country.  What is right for the country, regardless of what he decides, is strong leadership.  He don't have it.  I agree.  But what's the point of voting?  Just put in a dictator that's going to do the best for everybody.  No, no.  He's voting based on what he thinks he's going to do.  He's going to do a good job.  Right. 
[01:22:30]  And based on what they want.  No, no, no.  You think...  They're voting based on his policy, based on what he says he's going to do, and they  like what he says, because he's doing what the people want.  No, you would think...  Then who would ever have voted for an income tax?  Do you think when they first got income tax, people were like, all right, I'm glad I voted  this guy in.  This is great.  No.  It's for the best of the country.  They did it.  What?  Before they started ripping those off in the beginning taxes, it makes sense.  Now it... 
[01:23:00]  I'm sure the people didn't like it when it was first enacted, my friend.  I'm sure they all didn't like it.  Hey, we're going to start taking a skim off of your fucking money.  You like that?  Yeah!  No, they didn't like it.  But it was something that the president and Congress and everybody that was elected  had to enact for the greater good of the country.  Now, I'm saying, regardless, going into Libya, not going into Libya, either way, it doesn't  fucking matter. 
[01:23:30]  He's not a strong leader on the international front.  If he wants to, you know, push around Americans and force them into having the government up  their fucking ass at every turn, he's great at that.  I'll give him that one.  But when it comes to leaving our borders, he's not respected in the international community.  He's not looked at as a strong leader.  He's looked at as a pushover. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  I agree with you.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Well, I got a question for David in Israel.  David.  What is it that makes you sound so Jewish?  There is almost a Jewish twang to his voice.  Yeah, I don't understand that.  It's that Israel thing.  What makes you sound so Jewish, David?  Can you answer that?  Opie, Opie, you got me once.  I'm not falling for it again.  No, I'm not hanging up on you.  I really want to know.  What is that?  Because I go down to my B&H store there.  Yeah.  And man, they know how to sound real Jewish in there, too.  Do they?  What is it, though?  They're not a crutch. 
[01:24:30]  That's the language of the Jews.  There is kind of a thing.  Yeah.  That is almost a Jackie Mason.  Do you got an extra part somewhere in your...  An extra part?  You're shaggy.  Do you got an extra part?  Jimmy the Greek, that was it.  Do you got an extra little something in your vocal cords?  See, what the Jew has is an extra bone in their jaw so they could talk more about bargains.  All right, Jimmy the Greek.  All right, live from Israel, David. 
[01:25:00]  What makes them sound so Jewish?  I don't know.  It's like an accent.  It's almost like a dialect.  It's a dialect, like a black dialect.  Jewish people have a dialect.  Italians, like hardcore.  You go to fucking Brooklyn and talk to Italians there.  They got that whole fucking, hey, what's going on thing.  Yeah.  It's just a dialect, yeah.  People have them.  I don't understand so much.  You can't really comment on it, though, because it comes off as being insensitive, racist, and 
[01:25:30]  kind of, you know, like you're pointing out something that is right in front of your face,  yet you shouldn't point it out.  You didn't sound like a Jew-y Jew.  You absolutely did.  My David.  We made fun of the Asians and the Jews.  Asians, Jews.  And the blacks.  Blacks.  Well, that could just...  And the blacks.  You could actually just put that as a sticky every day.  Oh, really?  The blacks?  Yeah, put it up as a sticky.  Well, that's what people think, anyway.  They think I'm a hardcore raging racist that just can't stop railing against the black community. 
[01:26:00]  Meaning they're not sure yet?  Some of them aren't.  Yeah.  Jim Florentine's going to join the show next.  It's been a while.  Yes!  And, of course...  I call him J-Flo.  J-Flo.  Yeah.  He should go with that.  And Jim Norton, of course, not here because he's being a big star.  A big star doing a Tonight Show.  And what other show is he doing?  One of them Chelsea shows?  Oh, Chelsea Handler.  Yeah? 
[01:26:30]  He's on the Chelsea Handler?  I think maybe today he's doing Chelsea Handler.  That's with Liv Tyler.  She...  I was looking at her.  Well, she's no kid anymore, I guess.  Because it has something to do with American Idol.  Oh.  You know, he actually, when I interviewed him, he said,  one of his daughters wasn't supportive.  That's right.  And we didn't know which one.  So maybe it's...  Oh, God.  I guess one of Steven Tyler's daughters, not supportive of him going on American Idol?  Is it Liv Tyler or the fat Liv Tyler?  Well, you could have went with a supportive joke and did a fat joke. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, shit.  I didn't even think of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't either, obviously.  No.  Hey, Norton was on the Tonight Show last night.  We got a little taste for the people that maybe didn't stay up to see it.  I don't like when you...  You know, that taste thing works sometimes.  But when you're talking about Jimmy Norton, I don't want a taste of Jim Norton.  No?  No.  What do you think it tastes like?  Cum.  Cumzies.  Cumzies.  Always.  I don't think there's one part of his body you can lick where you won't taste cum. 
[01:27:30]  Taste cumzies.  Jimmy did a little something for spring break, and we got a little, I guess we can't say taste,  a little...  A little tidbit.  A little tidbit for everyone.  What's your name, buddy?  Chris Gooch.  Hey, Chris.  Where are you from?  Minnesota.  Minnesota.  Now, is this your first spring break?  This is my first spring break.  You enjoying it?  Oh, I'm loving it.  What are we going to do about Gaddafi?  Gaddafi?  I don't even know who that is.  It's a venereal disease.  Oh, we get tested for that at Planned Parenthood. 
[01:28:00]  I've had syphilis once, Gaddafi twice.  Now, how do you think your generation can kind of help us in the future?  Because we're kind of in a mess right now.  The state of the world is not good.  Well, you know, just go to school, keep it real.  Hear that?  Keep it real, Jay.  Keep it real, and we can save the world.  What do you think we can do as a country to avert disasters in the future, like Spider-Man  the musical?  I would honestly have to say, first off, it's all about Batman. 
[01:28:30]  So I think the message is, keep it real, and it's all about Batman.  Oh, I know why this is being played, and it freaked me out.  Rick Okasik.  Yeah.  Rick Okasik.  He is 62 years old.  62.  Holy shit. 
[01:29:00]  62.  No way is he 62.  Yeah.  He's always looked 62.  Yeah.  He's a guy that always looked old and ragged.  62, the new wave guy.  New wave pop guy.  I remember as a kid, that album coming out in, like, 76.  Yeah.  The Cars in Boston pretty came out, like, the same year, and they were a monster album.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, both those albums were all right.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Crazy.  And that guy hasn't put a pound on in friggin' 40 years.  No.  We, because we can't finger chicks anymore, we do birthdays.  On the air, yeah.  Just in case you're wondering why we're doing birthdays.  There's no insertion policy unless you're Howard Stern.  Another thing, by the way, that is much different.  Well, also, when you can insert your dick in management's ass, it's insertion, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's allowed to insert his dick wherever he wants.  We were saying, like, how fucked up would it be if, like, we decided to sue the company? 
[01:30:00]  Do you really think we'd still be sitting here doing a show?  It's just amazing.  And the halls are abuzz.  Abuzz.  Abuzz on the Howard News.  Because so is the news.  Which can't be good for the company.  And our stance, we did about a half hour on it to begin the show, if you want to hear the whole thing.  Listen to the replay today.  But you know what?  If it's in his contract, we don't even blame him.  No.  We don't blame him.  If it's money he feels is owed to him, then there you go.  That's what you get. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  That's the deal these guys made.  Run a company that revolves around one guy and see how that works out for you.  Mm-hmm.  Have fun.  But the halls are abuzz.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's on every news channel and everything, so it's not like it's under anyone's hat at  this point.  But knowing how radio works, they'll tell us to shut the fuck up, even though the whole  world is talking about it.  That's how they do it in radio.  Hoping that if we don't talk about it, maybe the whole thing will go away. 
[01:31:00]  And we're just leaving our wallets open today, if you want to add your wallet to the counter  over here.  Well, you know.  So they could just come in and take more money from us.  Take some cash.  Just take whatever you need.  The staff.  Everybody else.  Why not?  I heard a rumor about Eddie Trunk and what they try to do to him.  Oh, yeah.  I heard tell something.  Our pal Eddie Trunk.  I don't know how true it is.  I don't know.  But supposedly they were trying to knock him down, salary-wise, and he wasn't making much  to begin with.  It doesn't surprise me.  It really is just abominable.  Well, Eddie's going to be in here soon, so we'll ask him about that. 
[01:31:30]  What's up, Florentine?  What's going on?  Yeah.  Oh, we didn't do the rest of our birthdays.  What?  Shaka Khan.  Shaka Khan.  Shaka Khan.  Remember that song?  Shaka Khan.  Shaka Khan.  Shaka Khan.  Shaka Khan.  Shaka Khan.  She's an ugly 58.  She only had that one hit, though, right?  I don't even know if that was...  Were they just singing about her, or was that her band?  I don't even know.  Is it even a her?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a her. 
[01:32:00]  Right?  Yeah.  And would you?  No!  You wouldn't do Shaka Khan?  No, she's wild.  Florentine, I already know you would say yes to that.  You know, you've got to build up the resume.  Oh, that's rough.  I don't know.  I've done worse, but that's...  That's, like, weird.  I can't even see where she begins or ends or anything.  No.  A lot going on there.  Okay.  Whoa.  Would you?  That's a more recent picture. 
[01:32:30]  That's hard.  Oh, she looks like a fat Diana Ross.  Yeah.  Doesn't she?  Definitely.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at that ass.  All right, well...  That looks like a fucking fake suit.  Now you're losing me.  That's going to take me a three-day Cialis to maybe do that.  Let it sink in.  And that thing with those Cialis is, like, you don't just automatically get an erection.  You have to be aroused, so...  Oh, really?  That's how that works?  Yeah.  The all-day ones, I guess?  Yeah, you just don't...  I don't look at you and get an erection because I'm not Cialis. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one that they advertise where you take it and you're ready at a moment's notice.  You know?  Yeah.  They show the old wife and the old husband sitting there,  and it's in the kitchen, and she's, like, cutting up some fucking broccoli or some shit  or some peppers, and he brushes against her, and she kind of turns her head and looks  at him, and then, you know, normally she'd get that look like, huh?  And then go like, oh, that's right.  He's got fucking a piece of linguine between his legs.  Yeah, but now he's got a...  But then they look all fucking like, yeah, okay, we're going to be doing some of that 
[01:33:30]  fucking...  He's got that big turgid penis now.  You ever see the one where the guy's going to the doctor and his reflection is hounding  him about his fucking...  Yeah.  ...his limp dick?  Yeah.  He's like, come on, ask the doctor.  No, I don't want to.  He's talking to the window.  Right.  He's fucking talking to the window about his dick.  Come on.  He goes to the doctor.  Come on.  You know we're both sick of your lack of heart, Audra.  Come on.  Why wouldn't you tell your doctor, look, doc, I can't get a rod.  Give me a pill.  Yeah, give me a pill today.  Is that really?  There's other stuff that's a lot worse. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That you tell your doctor.  But he's like talking to his reflection.  He goes, all right, I think I will.  And then he comes out and the look the wife gives him, whether they're having dinner or  some shit, she touches his hand and gives him a look like, thank God, I'm finally going  to get some cock.  Those commercials are just like the worst fucking...  But really, meanwhile, they've been married like 30 years.  They don't want to fuck each other.  They don't want to, exactly.  They're like 63, 64.  He probably just lost all their money in the 401k in the friggin' stock market.  They're miserable. 
[01:34:30]  They both have to go back to work at the fucking local path mark.  You think they're smiling and go, oh, what the fuck?  Yeah, she can't wait to come home from her job as a greeter at Walmart and suck on that  fucking half-hard dick.  He lost all their money because he gambled it.  He tried to put it in safe stocks and now their fucking retirement money's wiped out.  Oh, yeah, she wants to fuck.  And he wants to sell us for the younger women in the neighborhood, obviously.  He wants to look around and fucking jerk off just thinking about the neighbor or some  shit.  Not his dumb wife. 
[01:35:00]  God, we're so much misogynistic around here.  Well, because we don't know much about the broads.  Nah, we're trying to figure that out today.  We're trying to figure that out today.  One women's cause.  Yeah, like a woman's cause that isn't...  We don't really know any.  Do you know one, Jim?  Isn't championed by other women just to elevate the other women's thing.  Like, women are really concerned about it.  It's not like...  Because I was talking about Gloria Allred with this whore that fucking sucked L.T.'s dick.  And it's got to be a majority, too, because abortion... 
[01:35:30]  You know, the women will argue...  Breast cancer.  Yeah, I mean, that's a no-brainer, though.  Yeah, but just...  Well, not a no-brainer.  Well, not right.  Anyway, they...  That's...  You know that people are going to be against that.  Yeah.  Of course.  Is that a women's cause?  Breast cancer?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's like...  It's more of a guy's, because it's like, oh, man, my chick just lost her tits.  Yeah, that's bad.  That would be bad.  I bet a lot of guys leave women after that.  That would be horrible, too.  Jesus.  Well, that was when supposedly Favre was messing around with that... 
[01:36:00]  Right, right.  ...when his wife was back in Mississippi with a second round of breast cancer.  Yeah.  Yep.  That's fucked up.  I mean, I've done some shitty things, but I think that's going over the line.  I've done some shit.  Is that your line?  Yeah, because when your wife's back in Mississippi with the kids, and she's going through chemo...  Yeah.  ...and you're texting, like, some 21-year-old and showing a picture of your little mule...  His little dick.  I would just jerk it and go to sleep.  Yeah, yeah.  Just get the jerk out of the way?  Get it out of the way, and then you're like, oh, good, I'm glad I didn't go out. 
[01:36:30]  So let me go back to the playbook.  Yeah, good.  No, I could just fucking...  Yeah, concentrate on the game.  You could save hours in your day if you just fucking jerk it and...  You know what I mean?  Just leaves your mind instantly.  Yeah.  You're just like, oh, good.  Oh, okay, good.  That's gone.  That's over with.  Fixed that problem.  Instead of hunting for hours.  Exactly.  He's had a great line in one of his albums.  He goes, I was thinking about buying a $50,000 car when I woke up.  Then I jerked off, and I went back to sleep.  I never bought it.  It's perfect.  It really is what we're all about. 
[01:37:00]  I saw this show.  He was talking about that horrible mastectomy thing.  I saw this show years ago.  It was a movie called First You Cry.  Oh, why?  And it was before even Lifetime.  I think it was like an ABC Monday night movie thing.  It was First You Cry.  And SNL, when they had balls, actually did a skit on it on the guy.  It was the guy's side, First You Cry.  And he was all upset that his wife was losing her tits. 
[01:37:30]  It was on SNL?  Yeah, yeah.  That was years ago.  When did First You Cry come out?  Can we find this?  Who was in First You Cry?  Mary Tyler Moore and Anthony Perkins.  Anthony Perkins and Mary Tyler Moore.  Mary Tyler Moore.  First You Cry.  Wasn't she?  Yeah, that was a big one.  Isn't she one of those funny ladies?  Why is she always making these serious dramas?  Well, that's what she did after...  To show that she had another side to her?  Mary Tyler Moore show.  Yeah, yeah.  I hate that shit.  Like stupid Steve Martin and his banjo. 
[01:38:00]  Fuck him and his banjo.  Get on a stage and tell some jokes.  His dumb banjo.  Stupid banjo.  Ordinary People was the other movie she did.  Yeah, I know.  Where it was all serious and she was all freaked out.  Martin hasn't done stand-up since like 81.  I don't know how good he would be.  You don't think he could get back to it?  A little dated?  He's funny.  I mean, but I don't know.  You know, he used to have a lot of props and arrow through the head.  Is he funny?  Boy, that'd make people laugh.  I don't get it.  Man, I wish I started comedy back then.  Yeah.  I love him, man. 
[01:38:30]  He's a legend, but...  When was the last time you walked around and said,  Wow, did you see Steve Martin in that movie?  Blah.  What was the last one?  Well, yeah, you're right.  But the old ones are phenomenal.  Sure.  What is it?  Planes, Trains, what the hell?  Automobiles, yeah.  He played more of the straight guy in that, but...  He was amazing.  Yeah, the angry, cranky guy.  He had a great movie.  I liked that one.  Yeah, then he did some...  The Jerk.  The Jerk was good, but then he did some of those...  All right, after Planes, Trains...  The Corny White Guy That Doesn't How to Dance, one of those movies. 
[01:39:00]  Let's go to his IMDb.  After Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, was Steve Martin in a good movie?  A good, funny movie?  He was in, like, Rock Sand.  He did The Father of the Bride, but he was more of a straight guy in that.  Yeah.  True.  Parenthood?  No.  I wasn't buying that one.  What else has he been in?  The Jerk.  Then you got A Wild and Crazy Guy, the TV movie.  God, The Man with Two Brains.  God, was that awful. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah...  Which way are we going?  We have to go up?  Jerk.  We have to go up?  Yeah, we gotta go up.  All right, we gotta go up.  The Jerk 2?  Three Amigos.  Wait, there was a movie called The Jerk 2?  It says a TV movie, so...  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  No, what was that?  Come on.  By the way, when we talk about bad sequels, and you know we do Caddyshack, and then,  of course, Caddyshack 2.  Yeah.  And why don't we ever mention Arthur, and the second Arthur, where they try to have a sober Arthur?  Arthur...  I was just talking about that with some people the other day.  On the Rocks, it was called.  On the Rocks. 
[01:40:00]  Arthur on the Rocks.  Because we always talk about really bad sequels, but we never bring that one up.  You know what's good?  Arthur was about a guy, obviously, drank too much, rich, spoiled, and then he finds some  kind of, you know, redemption and fucking, when his butler guy dies and shit like that.  And his drunkenness was just enough irresponsibility for him to clean up and be like, yeah, I think  I gotta be a responsible guy.  And it was fun drunk and shit.  And then Arthur on the Rocks was, even as, while you're watching the movie, you're just 
[01:40:30]  thinking, wow, this guy's got a problem with his drinking.  It wasn't funny.  Right, yeah.  It was just kind of like, oh, now this guy, this should be intervention.  You know, he's real.  The first one's hysterical.  So this is the trailer for Arthur on the Rocks?  Oh, okay, of course.  The wonderful, lovable Playboy is back.  Hello, my beauty.  How you do this with such dignity is what baffles me. 
[01:41:00]  Thank you, sir.  He's Arthur.  Oh, boy, this looks so bad.  We were happy, weren't we?  Oh, sure we were.  Then we met.  You must hate those things.  They tried some of the same jokes.  Hit the bullet, hit the bullet.  And he's broke.  Arthur's just lost $750 million.  This was back when $750 million was considered a lot of money. 
[01:41:30]  They actually tried to do the exact same scenes.  What would you do if you were me?  The word B comes to mind.  We're looking for somebody who's honest, not afraid to learn, not afraid to do a little hard work.  Well, Hank, if you hire me, I'll help you look.  Dudley Moore.  They said the city would eat me alive.  Now look at me.  I have my own pale.  I have my own squeezy sponge.  I'll show them all.  Liza Minnelli.  I should have married you for your money.  John Gielgud. 
[01:42:00]  I think I've come just in time.  Arthur 2 on The Rock.  What can make you feel this way?  Myself.  Myself.  Myself.  Wow.  That was painful.  Okay.  So now put yourself in Dudley Moore's position.  He probably did 10 with Derek.  Whatever.  Bo Derek.  Bo Derek.  So he does this one.  So then he probably gets, they offer him like $3 million to do Arthur 2 because the first  one was a hit.  Do you take it?  Even though you know it's a shitty script. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's only done a couple films.  I think you take it.  At that point.  Do you have to just take it and realize you're just going to, it's going to be shit?  Maybe I can ad lib on the set, make it funnier.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you start thinking like, yeah, you talk yourself into it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, the first one was great.  We just kind of, same characters.  Yeah, I think it could work.  I think these guys don't care if they're in a bad movie, a lot of them.  We've talked to enough people where you get the feeling they don't want.  Well, Michael Madsen, but that's about. 
[01:43:00]  I think even in the end, he doesn't care.  He just knows the game.  No, that's what I mean.  He doesn't care.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He knows the game.  You know, you're going to be in a couple really good movies and you're going to be in  a bunch of shits, just how it is in Hollywood.  Yeah, I mean, audiences are very forgiving.  You know, you could do a couple duds and then.  Yeah.  Even De Niro's at that point.  And then if he comes out with a great film, the last 20 he's done, people are going to  forget.  We're waiting for De Niro to come out with something good, but as he gets older, it's  kind of hard to picture him in one of those good roles anymore, you know?  I don't know. 
[01:43:30]  Everything.  Like, stop trying to be funny.  Stop with the comedy thing and just be a mobster.  Just be a gangster.  You do that so well.  I know he does.  He's got one more good role, I think, that he's going to have.  You think he's got one more that's going to make us forgive him?  Yeah, we're going to forgive him for that.  All that shit.  I couldn't even see that one, 88 minutes or whatever, the one with Al Pacino.  I heard how bad it was.  I'm like, I'm not even going to, I'm going to pretend that didn't exist.  Jimmy loves how bad that is.  Fucking Norton loves how bad that fucking movie is.  Can't stop talking about it. 
[01:44:00]  Sometimes the really bad movies are really good.  I know.  Really good to watch.  And then the new Arthur just looks horrid.  Every trailer I see for it, I'm sorry.  It just looks fucking awful.  And I think you're right.  I think he doesn't drink in this as much as, like, I don't think it's drunkenness.  I think he's more retarded than drunk in this one.  Yeah, I think he's irresponsible.  Because showing someone drunk and having fun is very bad these days.  You can't do that.  Well, you could ask Russell Brand when he comes in.  You just gave Roland a heart attack down the hall. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, why don't you tell him?  When's he coming in?  Soon.  You could say all that to Russell when he's sitting in Jim Florentine's seat.  Is he?  Let's see if he got the balls.  I don't think he's going to.  I would.  I would.  I would say it.  You would say it?  Oh, I'd say, hey, great movie.  Fucking asshole.  And also, our management, me and Norton's management company, produced the new Arthur.  They produced the old one, the original.  Oh, really?  I don't know if they did Arthur 2.  So why aren't you in it?  I don't know.  If they filmed it in New York 2.  Why not?  Yeah, shit.  We said, can we just throw us in something?  I'll be the hot dog vendor. 
[01:45:00]  You guys are funny.  Why not?  Nothing.  Nothing, huh?  That sucks.  It's bullshit.  That's the way it should work.  Yeah.  Can we get rolling down?  Nepotism.  To come down the hall.  I want to see when Russell Brand is scheduled.  April 8th is when it comes out.  So he'll be in that week, probably.  Well, maybe.  Oh, it might be when you're not here.  I'll be on my cruise.  Motherfucker.  You might be off the hook.  I'll be on the cruise.  You might be off the hook.  I'll call in from the ship.  I have a satellite phone.  I'll call in just for that.  You can't get service out there.  Oh, I can.  Satellite phone? 
[01:45:30]  Phone.  Oh, yeah?  Satellite phone?  No problem.  I learned after being lost in the woods on a hike with my chick years ago.  He was...  Hold on.  Yeah.  You were 200 yards from your car.  You just didn't know what...  No, I wasn't.  You just didn't know what direction the car was in.  He makes it sound like he was on the Apple East.  So if you're in a bunker, I was.  If you were getting bombed and you're in a bunker, it's going to work?  Well, no.  You need a line of sight for the sky.  How far...  As long as you're outside, you're okay.  How far were you from your car in the end?  Real far.  Come on.  We were walking for all day and actually two days away from the car. 
[01:46:00]  Why two days?  Because it was the day we were hiking and then we had to spend the night in the woods and then woke up and the whole next day in the opposite direction until we hit another trailhead on the opposite side of the mountains.  Why would you turn around if you went a whole day without finding your car?  Because there were some rock cliffs that we climbed down and I knew, my chick, not me, I knew she wouldn't be able to climb back up.  So it was one of those point of no return things. 
[01:46:30]  Like in a video game where you drop off and you know you can't go back any further.  Gotcha.  So it was that.  We dropped down and climbed down these rocks knowing that we couldn't get back up and had to just continue going.  So after that happened, I decided I am getting a fuck.  Because you know what it's like to look at your cell phone and be like, here's your connection to the outside world.  I'm lost in the woods.  I really want to talk to somebody.  Oh, look at that.  It's fucking useless.  What if you climbed a tree?  I tried.  I tried. 
[01:47:00]  You did?  Oh, yeah.  I tried everything.  There was no fucking signal.  Were you scared?  Whatsoever.  I started getting a little.  I wasn't scared at all the first day.  Uh, into the, when it started getting dark, I started getting like, I don't, I started  thinking we're not going to be able to get out of here tonight.  Like you can't hike in the dark.  This was, I mean, rock cliffs, cliffs and fucking, uh, uh, everything.  Logs everywhere.  You couldn't fucking walk in the, in the dark.  So I'm starting to think, I think we're fucked. 
[01:47:30]  So I knew that there was a, I saw a sign that said lean to, and it had a little directional  thing.  And I guess a hunter's little lean to, and I wanted to make that by the time it got night  and we just made it by the nighttime.  It was pouring rain and, uh, cold as fuck.  And we woke up in the first like break of light and, uh, went to stand up.  But you actually were, were able to sleep?  Um, no, I wasn't able to sleep.  I kept looking and, and get, this is great.  We went out so unprepared.  This is like one of those dumb motherfucker things to do. 
[01:48:00]  Can I ask you something real quick?  Yeah.  Why would you go hiking?  You don't seem like a guy that hikes and definitely would have checked too.  Nope.  I'm not.  Like I could see you going with a couple of buddies, pitching a tent and just drinking  beers.  Yeah, whatever.  Exactly.  Like in the backyard.  Eating some steaks.  Right.  Who, who do you think wanted to go hiking?  Me or the chick?  Of course.  I fucking got talked into it.  Once again, easily influenced by a, by a woman.  And then she, we get up to the top of this one little mountain thing where she goes, 
[01:48:30]  all right, we'll eat, go, we'll stop here.  We'll eat lunch.  So lunch, all the water, everything, because we're, we're not that far.  So we go through everything.  And then she goes, Oh, I remember as a kid, when we used to come up here, we took the way  up that we came, but then we went down this way.  And all I was thinking was like, why don't we just go down the way we came up?  And then I started getting the look like, and I'm like, all right, we'll take the fucking  way down.  You remember when you were fucking like six years old.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  Great.  So we go down that way.  And I started knowing like really quickly.  I was like, are you sure?  And she's like, yeah, I'm positive.  And then after we did a couple of those drop-offs where we couldn't turn around, then I was  like, I started going, do you realize we're going back up a hill right now?  I go, it just changed.  We're now going up again.  I go, the up isn't out of here.  We went down.  We never went downhill and then uphill.  And then she's like, you look, all right, forget it.  Forget it. 
[01:49:30]  Keep walking.  Was there a lot of bitching going back and forth at that point?  Or were you working together as a team?  At the beginning, it was a weird.  There was a whole metamorphosis of emotions and all kinds of things that happened.  Because at first, it was very, we were, like, I was annoyed that she did this.  And I was annoyed at myself for going along with it.  When did you finally look at her and go, this is all your fault?  I never said that.  You wanted to.  I wanted to.  Boy, did I want to say, I fucking told you. 
[01:50:00]  We should have went down the way we fucking came.  This is the dumbest fucking thing.  It's textbook fuck up.  Was it early in the relationship where you wouldn't say that, you think?  Yeah, early enough.  Yeah, early enough.  Because you know if it was, like, a year or two in, you would have been called a cunt and everything.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It would have been one of those deals.  But it was just kind of like, okay, whatever.  So I went down and started walking up the hill and I realized we're fucking lost now and couldn't find a way out.  We found the lean-to, went to sleep.  I couldn't sleep, though. 
[01:50:30]  And get this.  It was freezing fucking cold now.  Cold rain.  She had a little fucking Jackie O red jacket.  And we had to try to share that to cover ourselves because it was freezing cold.  And all I was doing, and there was this, like, fog in the woods.  And all I could do was look out of the lean-to into where you can't see anymore.  And I'm just waiting for something.  It's like a Stephen King novel.  Something to come out.  And rationally, you know that, like, look, odds are nothing's going to come out of there. 
[01:51:00]  That doesn't help you, though.  It doesn't help.  In that situation.  I didn't want to shut my eyes because I imagined I was going to open them and a bear would be staring me right in the face or something.  So I just had a, I barely got any sleep.  Woke up.  Now, we've been walking all fucking day over rocks and things where your ankles are really taking like a beating.  They're going in directions they never go.  So, and from the cold air and wetness and stuff, I went to stand up and fell right the fuck down.  I was crippled.  I couldn't fuck.  Now I'm really starting to think, holy shit, I'm not going to be able to get out of here because I can't fucking walk. 
[01:51:30]  I'm crippled.  I'm going to be dragging my ass out of here.  And after getting up and standing up and walking around like I had a broken hip, I finally got enough, like, motion and blood back in my ankles and shit and the muscles moving where I could walk.  And for water, thank God it was raining because we found this one fucking tree where the top was split open and it acted like a funnel and just like a waterfall was pouring out of this tree. 
[01:52:00]  I was like, oh, thank you, God.  What kind of bacteria did you get from that?  I didn't get anything.  Fucking got really good.  The water was delicious.  It was great.  Now, we all have our breaking point.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happened.  No, no, no, no.  What would have it taken for you to say every man for themselves?  Because we all have it in our brain.  You think you don't, but you do.  There reached a point where I did crack a little bit.  We're walking and I honestly thought we were going to see something soon. 
[01:52:30]  And when we didn't, we rounded a bend and it was just more wilderness.  I just started going, motherfucker, shit, like cursing like a fuck.  This is bullshit.  We're fucking lost.  This is bullshit.  And she's just standing there knowing not to say a word.  And so we kept walking.  I shook it off, kept walking a little.  And I noticed I was just walking further and further in front of her.  Like I wanted to.  Now I just wanted out. 
[01:53:00]  So I'm kind of chugging a little more.  And she's just kind of walking and I had to keep stopping and going, come on, come on.  And then a black bear came walking out.  Like it was a little one, but it was one of those.  You ever see a black bear?  They're like very round.  I've never seen one.  They're very round and fucking fat and kind of like jostly and stuff.  You really saw a black bear?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember this part of the story.  Oh, yeah.  Walked right in front of the fucking trail we were on.  So I'm like, oh, God, fuck.  What do I do?  I go, I got to find some kind of stick just in case this thing turns around. 
[01:53:30]  So I see this log on the side of the trail.  I pick it up.  The thing just goes.  It was like oatmeal when I picked it up.  Just this rotted, wet fucking piece of oatmeal.  And then I'm standing there just like there's nothing I could fucking do.  If this thing or if the mother was around or some shit, done.  You got to think the mother was close.  Yeah.  So we waited for the thing to move on.  I said, just don't move.  And then we kept moving.  And finally, I found this little box on a tree with a little hinge and stuff, like a 
[01:54:00]  little mailbox.  And inside was a pencil and some paper.  And I guess you were supposed to like, if you're fucked.  So I put our names on there.  I was like heading this way down the trail and popped it in there.  And then about another two hours later, we came to a trailhead, popped out on a road,  found a ranger station with this stoned ranger kid in there.  That's like, oh, can I?  And we're fucking disheveled.  And we walk in and they had already known that we were missing.  Like the word was out that we were fucking missing.  How was the word out?  Because her mother was expecting us. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, okay.  And she called like the state troopers and everything.  And like the word was out that we were missing.  Usually it doesn't end well.  I know.  Well, it did.  So we walk into this trooper, this ranger, and he's like, can I help you?  And I'm like, yeah.  What do you think, asshole?  We're disheveled.  I go, yeah, we were lost in the fucking woods all night and shit.  He was like, oh, where?  I was like, I don't know.  We were lost.  We were back that way.  It doesn't matter where.  I go, I know where we started. 
[01:55:00]  It doesn't matter where.  So I go, I know where we started.  Could I get a ride back to our vehicle?  And he's like, well, I really can't leave.  I'm like, dude, we were fucking, like, it's either this.  I go, there's two scenarios that could have happened.  This, me walking in, or you go and you hear about the two dead people in the woods?  Can I have a fucking ride?  So he got us in the car.  He got us a ride back to my vehicle.  And there were two trooper vehicles there, a rescue vehicle. 
[01:55:30]  There were all kinds of things.  And we come pulling up in a car.  Hi.  Hi.  We're back.  How far were you away from your vehicle?  We were fucking miles away.  Really?  We had walked probably in two days, maybe 15, about 15 miles.  Holy shit.  You were 15 miles away from your car?  15 miles away from the car.  Oh, man.  You were a little off.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, take this way.  I remembered it when I was six.  Sounds like you were on the Appalachian Trail.  Does it go through that area?  I don't even know where I was.  I was on some dumb hill she used to climb as a kid. 
[01:56:00]  So how long were you supposed to be there?  Like two days to hike?  No, it was supposed to be an afternoon.  Oh, just an afternoon.  It was just to go up this hill, eat lunch, back down the hill.  Were you back in four hours?  Were you planning on banging?  Yeah, probably.  Did you guys talk about it or no?  No, not banging on the trail.  Probably when we got back to the place where we were.  I don't like, you know.  And the weather wasn't really good.  It was kind of drizzling and shit.  Okay.  So there was going to be an after hike banging.  You didn't bang one out on the lead two?  Not on the lead two?  The lead two?  No, no. 
[01:56:30]  If I could have gotten a rod then, I would have been Superman.  Holy shit.  Did you drop a deuce like in the two days that you guys were lost?  No, I think the nerves keep the shit in for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of get that nervous.  But then the second we, the first thing we found was like a campground with water fountains  and sinks and shit.  It was just like, I never sucked down so much water in my life.  And then, yeah.  And you didn't have to go either when you were lost?  No, no.  It was really kind of a just, you have one mission. 
[01:57:00]  It's just get the fuck out of there and don't die.  Right.  So, yeah.  They gave us like the little blanket things at some fucking bar and drove us back to the  house.  Took a little report and we were done.  But after that, I was like, I am never going anywhere without a satellite phone.  Imagine, though, imagine if you're like walking way ahead, you're so aggravated where no, she's  like, I got a shit.  And then she has to go.  And then there's, of course, there's no toilet paper.  No toilet paper.  You guys didn't prepare for that?  No, we didn't. 
[01:57:30]  She's like, what am I going to use?  And you just have to stand there and wait, waiting a longer.  I probably would have had to like give her my underwear to wipe with.  I would have ripped my underwear.  I'd have ripped my underwear into sections and saved it for toilet paper.  Florentine has weird scenarios.  No, that's something that could absolutely happen.  Who gives a fuck what anyone smells like when you're lost in the woods?  No, because you can't hike with shit in your ass.  Because if someone wants to go hiking with me, I'm like, all right, we're banging at  least twice.  You're going to be up against a tree if I'm going to go walk through the fucking woods. 
[01:58:00]  We're fucking.  I'm a grown man.  We're fucking.  Wear some of those fucking clothes.  Yeah.  That's a great story.  Yeah, that was the last time I fucking went hiking.  I'll never hike again.  I like hiking.  There's no reason.  Fuck that shit.  But the thing with the black bear.  Yeah.  Now you let the black bear pass by and you saw it kind of disappear, right?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you think there's black bears right around every corner now?  That's what I was thinking.  That would scare the fuck out of me.  And then from that point on, I was.  I was looking everywhere like, where the fuck is the next monster in these woods? 
[01:58:30]  I like being in the woods, but you start looking a little too deep in the woods and  and then your mind gets fucking weird.  Now the idea of going into the woods without a fucking gun and a satellite phone is retarded  to me.  Like, I don't know why I even did that.  The only problem with the satellite phone, is it getting smaller finally?  Yeah, they're pretty small now.  They are?  Yeah.  How small?  I got one in my bag.  You want to see it?  Yeah, let me see.  Can you text?  He's got a go.  He comes in here with a go bag now. 
[01:59:00]  That's not radio stuff.  This is your magnesium and your Flint fire starter.  Oh, so this is in case there's some attack in the city while he's here?  Yeah, I can start a fire on Fifth Avenue.  In case the zombies and the Puerto Ricans act up.  You never know.  He's ready to go.  One never knows when these people are going to start, when the race war will happen.  I'm not kidding.  I got like one of those.  It's a natural disaster kind of stuff.  Jim.  You got a whole food thing in there, like they have in the army that you can just eat?  Yeah, yeah.  MREs, things like that.  Do you have any of those?  I got some food. 
[01:59:30]  See, I come in with an iPad, do a radio show, and he's preparing for the apocalypse.  I got a cliff bar and a water.  Yeah.  A cliff bar and a water.  Look, he's got his go bag right here.  There we go.  We unzip this right here.  This is just the little go bag.  I have a good go bag.  And this is what he's willing to show us, by the way, Florentine.  He's got some other shit in there that he's not going to take out.  That's kind of big.  It's big, but it's not fucking, I'm not toting it around for fucking, it's even bigger when  you pull the engine off.  Look at the fucking huge shit.  But that's a satellite. 
[02:00:00]  Is it charged?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that a carrot top prop you're walking around with?  It's like Wall Street.  It is a Wall Street phone.  Oh, bye.  It pretty much is as big as the Wall Street phone.  And I have a solar one they use in the first Arthur.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a solar panel charger.  Do you have a getaway plan to leave the city, like if there's an attack?  Yes.  I have a getaway bag, too.  I did a whole show on it on Live from the Compound the other night.  But do you have a whole plan, like how to get out, which highways you're going to take?  You can't take highways. 
[02:00:30]  I think it's all dependent, though, on what's happening.  Like, it's like, is it a nuclear plant or is it some kind of natural disaster?  Is it people just fucking, you know, society gone awry?  I don't know.  I just like having shit just in case.  All right.  Rush hour traffic around the city is horrendous.  You think when there's an apocalypse you're actually going to be able to get on a road?  But he's already prepared.  He's going to be the first one in his car and out.  I just got to get out.  Is it a bicycle to get over the bridges or a boat or a helicopter?  He'll get a cab and go, he's 500 bucks, just take me over to George Washington. 
[02:01:00]  Get me into Jersey.  Traffic's going to be at a standstill.  You're going to be too busy looking at the flying saucers in the air.  I don't care.  I'll fucking take a boat.  I don't give a shit.  That river.  You need a boat.  And by the way, I did show in the go bag the most important thing is a gun.  Because with the gun, you could get anything else you need.  See?  Louis C.K. was talking about his gold.  He goes, yeah, you know, he goes, I like always carrying a piece of gold with me, a little gold piece, 
[02:01:30]  because if money becomes worthless or something happens, he goes, you could always get something with gold.  I go, that's why I like having a gun, because I could take your gold with the gun.  You're not wrong.  So the gun and communication is like your two biggest things.  One of them wind up radios, you know, so you can hear what's going on.  Then there's little packs of food and water, little water things, water filtration systems.  Who's going to be the asshole to do a radio show as the apocalypse is going on?  Wouldn't that guy want to get out, too?  Somebody probably would. 
[02:02:00]  I think it's more like, you know.  Somebody's going to stay behind?  Yeah, you'd get some info.  There's hardcore radio guys.  There'll be Twitter, though.  Eddie Trunk would be on.  You've got the Twitter, though.  You'd be fucking rocking to some metal tunes while you're trying to flee the area.  What about the Twitter, though?  You don't need that shit.  Twitter?  You just need the Twitter.  I don't think anyone's going to be tweeting, either.  You don't think?  No.  I don't think I could tweet on the satellite phone.  Wow.  Good point.  No Twitter.  That's just for the worst-case scenario.  But there's other levels of it.  Like, do you just have to get out of the immediate area because a nuclear plant is fucking doing something? 
[02:02:30]  Did you bury your boat in the woods yet, like I suggested?  Did I bury?  Every good plan has a boat stashed away somewhere.  No, I didn't have that.  I could take a boat.  I could go to the North Shore and just take a boat.  How?  If all the boats are taken by all the guys that got there before you?  No one's going to take all the boats.  You have to have a secret boat?  I'm telling you.  Scott, do you understand there are guys with families that own these boats that have to get their kids together and the wife and then get shit?  I'm ready to go.  The second something happens, I'm gone. 
[02:03:00]  Have you timed how quickly you could get to the shore?  Three minutes.  You probably have.  Three minutes.  So you would head towards Long Island?  Fire in the hallway.  You would head towards Long Island instead of, like, Long Island Sound.  Because if I'm home, I'm home the majority of the time, which I live on Long Island, I would head to the North Shore, grab a boat, and fucking head to either Connecticut or what?  I'm just going to tell you that everyone's heading in that direction.  So trick the zombies and the Puerto Ricans, go the other way, to the ocean.  South Shore?  Yes.  No one's going South Shore. 
[02:03:30]  Here's the problem.  It's a lot farther to get to some kind of land, and you've got to go through some heavy-duty waters.  North Shore, you go across the Sound, you're in Connecticut, now you could cut over, you could do a lot of shit.  See, I'm thinking north.  I'm going north.  Maybe even Canada, if you have to.  Why not bury a jet ski?  What?  How do you bury a jet ski?  Then how do you dig it up?  Well, not bury it.  You know how they had the comm...  You don't have a shovel in your bag?  Oh, I do have a shovel in my real go bag.  It's in my real go bag, which is at home. 
[02:04:00]  This is just a quickie.  But the go bag I have at home has a military...  One of those shovels, they're like as big as your hand, but they fold out, and you screw  it, and boy, you're digging foxholes.  You ain't fucking around, Jim.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, I got a bunch of shit in there.  Filter devices, all kinds of fire starting equipment, because, you know, I could start  fire even if shit's wet.  This shit's of magnesium, shit burns like 5,000 degrees.  Might be on to something.  You've got to just be prepared.  You know why? 
[02:04:30]  Now I throw it in the closet.  It's in there.  And if something happens, and you're like, fuck, it's right there.  And you're the first one out the house, first one heading to your escape route, and other  people are trying to collect up fucking canned goods?  All right.  Blow me.  I didn't realize the interest in this.  I just turned to my left for the first time.  Go bags are huge.  In a half hour.  Go bag.  The phones, they have a lot of questions for you, sir.  Let's go to John in Alabama.  We got Jim Florentine in studio, by the way. 
[02:05:00]  John, what's going on?  Hey, who the fuck are you going to call?  Yeah, that's true.  Who am I calling on the satellite phone?  You going to call Katie Couric?  I'm calling the radio station that I get on my wind-up radio.  I'm going to request a song.  It's a good question.  Who are you calling if an apocalypse is going down?  I'm on the chopper for Mel.  Look, would you rather have communication or not?  I'm not calling.  I'm not calling.  Look, look.  Hey, dummy.  I'm not fucking calling a friend of mine to see what he's up to tonight. 
[02:05:30]  You can call whoever you might need to call at the time.  You don't know.  It's a very fluid situation.  So you go with your fucking Verizon plan or your AT&T and try to dial away.  Or if you do hear something where there is someone or something or some place that could be helpful to you, 
[02:06:00]  you try to figure out where you are while I'm just pulling up my fucking latitude and longitude on my phone  and telling people where I am so the chopper can get me.  Blow you!  Me!  What?  All right, let me say hi to Ron in Georgia.  Ron.  Ron.  What's up, Ron?  Come on, boys.  Love you.  Love your show.  Quack, quack.  I do Ironman training to prepare for the apocalypse if it ever happens.  Ironman training?  2.4-mile swim.  Yeah.  2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike, and then a 26-mile marathon. 
[02:06:30]  I'm ready for when it happens.  That'll only get you 25 miles away.  That's great.  While you're huffing and puffing, I'll blast you one.  Right.  Thanks to Ronald Reagan for my military training.  I am prepared.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  I think you need a little more than that.  That's not in your bag.  A 12-mile run, a 25-mile swim.  No, no, but I do work out.  Oh, yeah.  Let me say hi to Matt in Ohio.  See the guns?  Hey, Ant, I just want to make sure you have a handheld chainsaw. 
[02:07:00]  Have you seen one of those?  Yes, I did there.  I have one of those, as a matter of fact.  It's like a chainsaw blade.  You don't have to say it, as a matter of fact.  We just believe you.  It's like a chainsaw blade.  So what do you think you're going to need that for?  Well, if you've got to bring down a little tree or something.  I was under the impression of a tree.  You might have to cut a tree down.  Where's a tree going to be in your way?  Well, you know, you might need it for some kind of shelter.  It's New York City.  No, no, no.  You're out.  You're out of the cities.  There's no city.  You're out of the cities.  You're not out of the city.  So if a tree falls on Connecticut Turnpike, you're going to come out of your car and cut it. 
[02:07:30]  I've got to get in.  You might have to.  You take your rowboat across the Long Island Sound, right?  Rowboat?  And it's still cities until you get past Hartford.  There's no trees until you get past Hartford.  But see, that whole situation is going to be bad.  Everyone's going to be in fucking traffic and bullshit and everything.  You've got to go to a place where you know, like maybe a little northeastern parts.  But then you're in some rough waters, sir.  No, no, not past the point.  Oh, okay. 
[02:08:00]  You're going up and then north, and then you've just got to deal with the woods.  And hence, you know, the little...  So like Providence, Rhode Island, maybe somewhere up there.  Well, you've got to keep going further.  Maybe Vermont, New Hampshire.  In the woods.  But Vermont's not connected to the water?  No, no, in the woods.  No, you've got to go overland at that point.  Okay.  But where does the chainsaw come in?  Like, where do you think the...  Let's say you're in the woods, right?  And you've got to set up shelter, and you need some wood.  You need some sticks to make poles and stuff.  But if there's like a radiation fallout, the woods isn't going to help.  Well, you've got to get as far away from the plant as possible from the radiation. 
[02:08:30]  Are you talking nuclear war kind of thing?  Because then we're really...  Hold on.  We're on a map now, thanks to Danny.  So you can't go all the way out east to get in the water.  I'm going to stop at the Mohegan Sun and play a few hands of blackjack.  See, Danny's pointing at the easternmost point of Long Island.  He's not going to go in the water there.  There's no way he would get to that point.  How about I just go straight across to Bridgeport?  Bridgeport!  Yeah, and then I continue north.  Look, there's nothing there.  It's all green. 
[02:09:00]  Well, there's a lot of green to the left of Bridgeport.  And a lot of black.  Or how about I go in and up the river, and then I go up the Hudson.  You're going to want to deal with 95 during the apocalypse?  Thank you.  That's what I keep telling them.  No, I'm crossing right over it.  Where's the Connecticut River?  Crossing right over it.  Connecticut River's a good river.  There's a river there?  How about I go west?  How about I go west and then go up the Hudson?  Now, whose boat are you taking?  I'm stealing one.  And you're going to know exactly where to go?  Yeah, there's plenty of marinas.  I know where all the marinas are on the North Shore. 
[02:09:30]  I've been to plenty of them.  Where are you going to find the Keys?  Keys schmieze, motherfucker.  It's a boat.  If you can't hotwire a boat, you're a retard.  You know how to hotwire a boat?  Yes!  It's easy.  You ever see fucking...  I have no idea.  It's not even like a car with a goddamn dashboard you've got to get into.  So why Keys?  What if the boat only has like a quarter tank of gas, and it's only going to go for about an hour?  There's gas stations.  No one's going to be...  During the apocalypse?  There's gas stations right there.  All along the marina.  You don't think my bolt cutters are going to fucking be able to cut the padlock off of that thing?  Bolt cutters, chainsaws...  And believe me...  Shovels. 
[02:10:00]  You're a landscaper.  Do you have a weed eater?  I'll be edging for the apocalypse.  I'll be edging until the apocalypse.  And...  If I come wheeling up with an AR-15 and a couple of fucking 1911-45s strapped on me,  I don't think all these guys at the gas station are going to be armed that quickly.  The trick is...  And let me tell you something.  And this is the reason I have everything ready to go.  The trick is speed. 
[02:10:30]  You have to get the fuck going before everybody else decides I have to get going and gather everything up.  So leave now.  That's a good idea.  I'm out of here.  You might want some hedge clippers, too, because if you're in the woods and the pats aren't clear...  Check out some hedge clippers?  Yeah, just...  That's heavy for a go bag.  This guy wants to help you with your sat phone.  He's got a lot of numbers already programmed in there.  Go ahead, Bill.  In Missouri.  Hello, Bill.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  I'm just going to back Anthony up.  I guess you got iridium, right? 
[02:11:00]  What?  Yeah, yeah.  You're both iridium, yeah.  No, I put Department of Justice in it.  I put...  What are the three?  I have Department of Justice, Fox News, and...  Oh, the Pentagon.  You do a little research on the Internet, you can find their...  Ah, see?  There you go.  Oh, you have a sat phone, too, sir?  Yeah.  See?  An iridium sat phone.  And he programmed in very pertinent, very good government...  Why is the Pentagon pertinent?  Because then you can say, hey...  Who the fuck is going to pick up a phone at the Pentagon during the apocalypse? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, they're always there.  They don't go home.  They're like fucking...  So you're going to tell them you're in the woods of Vermont somewhere?  I'm just going to say...  You're going to call the Pentagon.  I won't tell them where I am.  I'll just be like, hey, you got any updates on what's going on?  On the zombies?  You know, somebody...  And he goes, oh, wow, we haven't gotten many calls.  And I'll say, yeah, because not many people have sat phones with the Pentagon programmed in.  And they'll be like, okay, well, here's what's happening.  Sat phone call, regular phones?  Call soon.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I didn't know.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:12:00]  It's very handy.  Very handy item.  But how do you call...  See, you have a sat phone because the regular phones aren't going to work.  So if you call a regular phone, how are they going to pick up your call?  Well, that's just it.  If you have a regular phone, then you're shit out of luck.  So you have to get other sat phone numbers?  No, if it's localized, if it's a localized problem...  I think you're...  I think you're...  I think you're...  I think you've got holes in your plan.  No, I do.  You don't even have a plan.  If there's an apocalypse, do you think someone's going to be answering the phone at the Pentagon?  Maybe.  Nah.  Maybe one guy. 
[02:12:30]  We left the maid.  Because Washington's going to be in disarray.  Because Washington will be a mess.  Yeah.  It'll be a mess.  Yeah.  Think about how surprised they're going to be when the damn phone rings.  Imagine that guy.  Who the fuck is this?  That's fucking Bill.  Right on, brother.  Oh, that's funny, man.  His delivery was perfect that night.  Yeah.  See, you can pick it apart.  And I understand a lot of people...  Okay, okay.  Keith says drive south to him. 
[02:13:00]  Boat is always fueled with all provisions.  That's right.  Okay, Keith, the cop has a boat.  I told you.  Go south.  On the south shore.  So I can hit the south shore.  So all we need to do is just pick it up out of the driveway and dump it in the water.  And we'll be set.  Oh, it's not fucking in the water yet?  What is this?  A seasonal Armageddon that we got to deal with?  We got to make sure his boat's in the fucking water?  Keith.  It's not good for the apocalypse.  Fully fueled, yeah.  And I got a very important call coming in.  Yeah?  I really do.  Okay.  Because you're talking about the apocalypse.  This guy wants to tell you how hard it was to leave after Katrina. 
[02:13:30]  Which is a little different than the apocalypse.  Oh, don't even get me started.  Mark in New Orleans.  Before Katrina, trying to get out of New Orleans.  Yeah.  It was, you know, a normal trip across the Gulf Coast.  We have a house in Pensacola.  It was like three hours.  It took us 18 hours on the highway going 10 miles an hour.  Oh, my God.  That's fucked up.  With a week's fucking notice.  With a week's notice that it was coming.  The road was clear, you motherfucker.  And how many people in New Orleans had cars? 
[02:14:00]  Yes.  A million people that live in the metro New Orleans area trying to evacuate.  How many fucking million people are there in New York?  When did you try to leave, sir?  Don't lie, because I'll know.  We left like a day and a half before the...  All right.  And they knew it was swirling in the Gulf, headed your way.  And everyone waited and waited.  That's what I'm talking about.  Rapid deployment.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  But you're going to have to guess when that is, Ant.  You've got to use your instincts.  If the apocalypse doesn't tell you when it's coming, it's going to be here.  No, but the second you see danger, that's when you've got to start making your move. 
[02:14:30]  Those are the people that fucking make it.  Yes, Opie, hand up.  Did you read the headlines today?  There's danger around us.  Not right around us.  It's on the periphery.  Can we break out a window and scale down to the street?  You're better if there's no notice, because you're already prepared.  I'm ready to go.  If there's no notice, that's when you're going to get fucked.  Right, that's when I'll be fucked.  Like you're saying, you're going to be the first guy.  You're going to be leading the pack.  Got to get out immediately. 
[02:15:00]  Take your go bag and go.  That's it.  Strap yourself up.  A lot of ammunition, a lot of firepower, and a lot of food and water.  Any bottles of liquor in there?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Captain Morgan.  The big, big jug of Captain Morgan.  That's heavy.  Because you've got to disinfect.  Pete in Vermont.  And a medical kit.  Yes, I have a small medical kit.  With some band-aids.  Well, no, it's a little more than just the medical kit.  You got iodine for the radiation?  I don't have iodine on tablets.  You better fucking buy yours.  I don't have those tablets for the radiation. 
[02:15:30]  Pete in Vermont has a very good observation.  He's telling me to stay the fuck out?  Nah, sort of, Pete.  All right, what's up?  Hey, Ann, about six minutes ago, you were lost in the woods with your girlfriend, scared  of a bear cub, and now you're going to come up here and face the apocalypse?  I wasn't prepared then.  I learned my lesson through experience, sir.  None of us wanted to point out that it was a bear cub, by the way.  That's a great point.  It was a bear cub.  But I learned.  Now I'll never go anywhere without a gun and a sat phone. 
[02:16:00]  You got a mirror on your gun?  For the people coming from behind, somebody wants to know.  No, you got to have a wingman there to cover your ass.  You're not waiting for anyone else.  I got to take Keith's boat.  There'll be other people in my group.  Yeah.  How many bullets you carry?  I swear, I'm looking.  I've been thinking about that.  Yeah, because that's important.  Ammo's very important.  So I think I'll load up a lot of .45. 
[02:16:30]  I think .45 is good.  And .45 is pretty common if you've got to ransack any places that you might be able to  find some ammo.  You don't want some exotic ammunition or anything like that.  So, yeah, I'm thinking .223s and some .45.  Yeah.  That's about it.  Maybe three or four different pistols just in case you've got to dole them out to a few  people.  You know.  You know.  Sounds like a party. 
[02:17:00]  Your to-go bag sounds like it's going to weigh 200 pounds.  Well, you know what?  It's very long.  For how much is it?  No, that won't last long.  Believe me.  If there's an apocalypse, I'm drinking.  It's fairly light for how much shit is actually in it.  There's those little packets of water that will last five years without opening them.  And they're good for, you know, the emergency.  Like, that's the last case scenario before you drop dead. 
[02:17:30]  But then there's also filters where you could take, like, a standard water bottle like this  size and refill it and filter it 250 times through there.  And you could take shitty water and it filters all the bad gunk right out.  Just things like that that you might have to deal with.  Okay.  I'm just saying.  We got another guy here.  He has a Tom Cruise scenario for you.  Oh, right?  Ross in Atlanta.  What's up, Anthony?  What's up, man?  How can Tom Cruise wrap up Armageddon in three hours with a bad script and two kids and you 
[02:18:00]  need a, you know, a 300-pound pack and an arm?  That's because that was bullshit.  Bullshit!  This is the real deal I'm dealing with.  I'm prepared.  Things happen.  I got a shitty house in Atlanta here you could buy if you need a backup place to go stash.  A safe house?  I need a safe house.  Every good video game has a safe house.  You need a safe house.  You got safe houses out there?  Where you can sleep.  I don't have a safe house.  I know one good place, though.  Yeah?  I know one good place.  And I could even say it because no one would ever be able to find it. 
[02:18:30]  What is it?  It's an old silver and turquoise mine in the Mojave Desert.  How the fuck are you going to get all the way out there?  You got to fucking be creative.  Now you're talking about aircrafts.  No, you got to be creative.  You got to somehow get your ass out because that is where no one's fucking going.  And, you know, you got some shelter.  Now, what would you take there?  Would you take the boat to Connecticut?  I think I would take the boat across Route 66.  No, you'd have to then overland. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, you'd have to go, depending on where the catastrophe is.  You know, if it's north, you got to go south.  If it's south, you got to take the northern route.  You got to be able to, you can't have a set plan.  You know, you got to improvise, adapt, overcome like the Marines say.  I hear you.  You know?  What are you going to do?  Let's go to Robert.  Robert.  Hey, let me talk to John Connor Cooney, please.  He's right here, sir.  Hey, Anthony, your boat idea is a good idea, man, because, you know, all watermen do not 
[02:19:30]  ever leave their boats empty in the marina.  Every boat is always filled because they don't want water and gas.  That's true.  That's right.  So, see, your plan for the boat is a pretty good idea.  Of course.  I've been thinking about the boat.  That part's in good shape.  Or how about jacking a fucking plane?  Not so good.  You're not going to fly.  I know.  Not totally.  It's simulators, but I don't think you know enough.  I took an experience, the world of flight course. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  That's pretty good.  I got to actually hold the yoke.  How long do you think it's going to take you to hotwire a boat?  That wouldn't take long at all.  I don't think.  No?  No, no.  Once you get in there, the wiring is pretty simple for the ignition.  It's like old school car ignitions on a lot of boats, especially old ones.  Oh, let me see.  I'm getting another communique.  I have five cases of 40 cal and three cases of 45.  Can I come with you?  I would be proud to have you, Mike.  Oh, nice.  Let's just say that. 
[02:20:30]  That would be some good firepower, having Mike.  The question I got for the people that are escaping the apocalypse, where are you actually  running to?  Because aren't you running to a place?  You're running to survival.  But aren't you running to a place where those people are running?  No, no.  See, here's the problem.  America is fat and lazy and unprepared and thinks nothing can ever happen.  And what you will see are the fattest refugees you've ever seen in your life going to either 
[02:21:00]  Mexico or Canada, whatever.  But big lines of people that look like they're from the show, Heavy, Hoarders, things like  that, with canes, with little dogs, walking on these roads to nowhere.  And there will be a few, select few, that are scattered about the country, taking care  of business, as they say.  TCB.  So that we may continue.  You're really losing your mind. 
[02:21:30]  What?  Because it's happened.  It usually happens like every 10 years we have the apocalypse.  Well, probably a little longer.  The world's ended 17 different times over the last 200 years, so I can understand.  All right.  Perhaps past performance is not indicative of future result.  But look, you never know.  My whole thing is you just don't know the future.  If everyone's running away and being chased, why wouldn't you stay put?  And then, like, you know what I mean? 
[02:22:00]  Because where?  Your houses aren't going to be safe.  Yes, it is.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Because the people that are in charge of the apocalypse, they're chasing people the whole  time.  No, this could be bad.  So if you stay put, they think your house is empty because you ran away.  No, see.  And then you're sitting nice in your compound.  Are these people going to go house to house?  Well, again, it all depends on what the emergency is, where it is, how contained or  widespread it is.  There's no definite plan of leaving the house, let's say.  See, I might just stay in my house. 
[02:22:30]  There's no definite plan.  You might have to defend your home.  That's why I think you should start digging the tunnels I told you about the other day.  Tunnels?  Yes.  You have a private house to start digging tunnels.  Why dig them if they're finished, my friend?  Why dig them if they're finished?  You got a mini compound under your pool?  Ah, you never know.  You never know what's going on over there.  Maybe that's where all the water goes.  That's where the water in my pool goes.  You fuck it up.  Motherfuckers, I got to find where that water goes.  90,000 gallons?  Where could it have gone?  Oh, my God.  I think that dead tree has been drinking the whole thing. 
[02:23:00]  I got a tree dying in the background.  What house is trying to figure out why their basement is full?  Wow.  Right?  Thank God I'm not on the downhill side of my pool.  Holy shit.  Did you really lose 90,000 gallons?  It was full.  I just checked under the cover.  It's completely empty.  No.  It's a built-in pool.  No.  Yeah.  No?  Yeah.  Where the fuck's the water?  I don't know.  Wow.  Someone stole it.  I think it's the main drain.  Well, it has to be.  But no neighbors are knocking on, hey, do you have a leaky pool? 
[02:23:30]  Because my house is a wreck.  How would they know?  It would just be like, well, we must have a leak.  One of the houses right around you?  But it's probably slowly leeching through their cement basement walls, and they don't  even know where it's coming from.  Someone in your neighborhood is pissed.  They don't even know.  They're probably like, wow, why is this chlorinated water coming in my...  Oh, my God.  No.  I don't know where it's going, to tell you the truth.  I'm going to have it fixed, though, hopefully, before the season opens up and I refill it.  Right.  But my water bill was atrocious last year.  I didn't know because I have an auto fill, and it just kept filling it up and filling it 
[02:24:00]  up.  And it was leaking out and leaking out.  And then I got my water bill, and it was 90,000 gallons of water I had gone through.  And it cost me like, $420 water bill.  I went through 90,000 gallons of water.  You know, yesterday was water day, too.  Was it?  Yeah, for the world.  I have a hell of a carbon footprint and a water footprint and everything else.  I don't know what the water day was all about.  What's that?  I don't know.  I'm confused.  A lot of people saying, let's shower together.  It's 75% of the planet.  Stop with your water shortage. 
[02:24:30]  It's desalination plants.  People are stupid.  Don't worry about the water.  This place is going to be spinning just fine without any of us.  That's what I think.  All right.  We should take a break.  Yeah.  You're all set, though, for the apocalypse.  I'm set.  I'm ready to rock, as they say.  Florentine, what are we promoting today?  I see you've got something nice here, huh?  Yeah.  A new Meet the Creeps out today.  Volume 3 featuring Club Soda King.  Is that to give out?  This is good for the apocalypse, too, to watch.  Yeah, I'm going to put this in my go bag.  You might have a little DVD player when you're in the woods in Vermont. 
[02:25:00]  You know what?  Once I come across some people after Civilization's been gone for a while, I could just reflect  it in the sun, and they'll go, ooh, and give me food for it.  You know, when people forget about DVDs.  Available today at jimflorentine.com.  Pick it up.  Kenny's on the Club Soda.  Kenny's on the Club Soda.  I see that.  It's from Club Soda, Kenny.  Oh, my God.  Kenny.  And then this weekend, Jim Florentine will be at the Hartford Funny Bone.  Look at that.  Right in my go bag.  Nice.  There you go.  I feel honored.  It's going in there right next to the grenades. 
[02:25:30]  More with Jim Florentine and Stephen Lang coming by today.  What time is Stephen Lang coming in?  Who is he?  Stephen Lang.  He's the guy.  He was the, isn't that guy that was the sergeant?  Oh, the avatar guy.  The sergeant and avatar.  Oh, right on.  The big soldier guy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That guy.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, I knew he was coming in.  Yeah, he's got a couple of things. 
[02:26:00]  I just didn't know his name.  He's got a couple of things going on.  He's the big marine guy from Avatar.  Right.  The badass.  Yep.  That's him.  Okay.  And we'll talk about Chris Brown next.  Stay there.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Liz Taylor has died at the age of 79.  This was our favorite song.  Is that why you're playing it?  Yes.  Exactly.  That's the tie-in.  Yeah.  She loved this.  Oh, Liz. 
[02:26:30]  Poor Liz.  She's dead.  I guess Michael Jackson needed her, huh?  Oh, yeah.  They were asshole buddies, weren't they?  Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom.  Yeah, she's dead, though.  We know.  What did she die of?  What did she die of?  Anyone know?  No, huh?  I will guess.  She's had health problems for like 30 years.  Yeah.  I will guess.  I'm going to go with the old heart failure. 
[02:27:00]  It's funny.  She started getting health problems after Rock Hudson banged her.  Ah.  That was a long bout with AIDS that she had.  Holy shit.  How long ago did she die of congestive heart failure?  Very good.  No, she's dead.  And by the way, we beat CNN on the Twitter.  CNN with Dad, we got to confirm shit, is really fucking them up.  Yeah, fuck the confirmation of anything.  And I can't take responsibility. 
[02:27:30]  Everyone was tweeting this.  Everybody.  And CNN finally said, okay, Liz Taylor's dead.  It's too late now.  You're the news.  You're supposed to be the first one to tweet this.  Not some schmuck from Georgia.  What are they doing?  Yeah, 79 is not that bad.  She was 79?  I thought she was older, to tell you the truth.  Wendy, what age do you want to die, Anthony?  Ah, fuck you.  Jesus, Florence.  No, because if he's got a plan about friggin' apocalypse, I'm thinking he's probably about  70.  I think when you start fucking really getting a little falling apart, you notice that you're 
[02:28:00]  like really fucking losing it.  I'll tell you what's going on, man.  A lot of guys die at the age of 74 or 75.  Am I wrong, Ant?  We see it time and time again.  If you can make it past 74 or 75, you're going to live well into your 80s.  You bring the average up?  The 74 or 75 is a brutal couple of years for guys.  Look it up for yourself.  That's the hump?  Look it up for yourself.  You get past that, there's a good chance you're going to make 90. 
[02:28:30]  Really?  You don't die at 77.  You die at 74 or 75.  You don't hear like 81.  No.  Yeah, once you make it that far, you usually skate into the 90s.  Look it up.  74 or 75 are bad years for men.  I wonder how many people die in their 80s, because that is kind of weird.  And then you make it to late 80s.  Early 80s, not so much.  I know this shit.  That's interesting.  I don't know.  Danny's looking up statistics. 
[02:29:00]  75 wouldn't be bad.  Oh, that's Liz Taylor wheeling around in a fucking wheelchair.  Yeah, she deteriorated in the last couple months badly.  That's only Liz Taylor would fucking do.  What the hell is that?  Would you?  For the story.  You have to.  You have to.  You have to.  I love Florentine.  It's just like, you have to fuck anybody, really.  Well, you know.  I don't like playing the would you game with Florentine, because his bar is very, very high,  man.  He just.  He.  Is there a situation where you would say no to the would you question? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  There's some situations.  But, you know, I don't know.  To a guy, it's like building up a nice resume.  You know, some Hall of Fame numbers.  You might not have a lot, but, you know, you fuck like an Elizabeth Taylor.  That's like, you know, get in the game winning hit in the game seven of the World Series.  Right, right.  You came through your Edgar Renteria, who's won two World Series with big hits.  Never even considered the Hall, but like, man, that fucking guy came through in the clutch.  You didn't have the great numbers.  Yeah.  So that's the way I look at it. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Because then when you're, you know, when you get older and you, you know, settle down,  maybe you want to have wife and kids, you just know, hey, I had a Hall of Fame career,  or I was pretty close.  I was an underachiever.  And then when you're on the porch at 75, right before you die, you tell your grandkids,  I fucking look up Elizabeth Taylor.  Yeah.  I fucked that.  I fucked her.  What year?  Don't ask.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's, that's one of those.  It's like, uh, cause you could get her in her old age, but not in her prime.  Yeah.  Even that construction guy, remember she married that construction guy, got her. 
[02:30:30]  Yep.  He lost his house.  He had a shitty house after that marriage.  He lost his house.  I just saw an article on that guy.  What was his name?  Uh, he had the fucking feathery hair.  Like Larry something, I think.  Larry.  But you know, if a construction guy can get Elizabeth Taylor.  Oh yeah.  That anyone could have.  Yeah.  You could have.  Put in the work.  What was his name?  Cause I swear he lost his house recently and they said Liz can't help him.  For, what?  Furtensky.  Furtensky. 
[02:31:00]  Larry Furtensky.  Yeah.  He had that fucking rowdy, roddy, piper hair.  Yeah.  He looks like rowdy, roddy and they live.  Time was not kind to this guy cause they had a recent picture of him.  Oh, did they?  Wow.  Did he lose his curly locks?  He looks a lot different.  That's Liz and Larry's wedding, exclusive pictures of the cover of People.  With Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson was there.  Oh yeah.  He was, uh, what?  The best freak.  Maid of honor. 
[02:31:30]  She was married like seven times.  Oh yeah.  Just a whore.  Richard Burton like two or three times.  Yeah.  She was one of those.  It's like, uh, you know, uh, that whole Hollywood, marry 8,000 men multiple times.  And Richard Burton was like a raging alcoholic too.  Oh yeah.  She married him again.  Probably smacked her around.  She kind of liked it.  He's drunk.  Fuck you.  I think she kind of liked it.  If you go back to that, I think you kind of like, you know, there's, you got a little  freaky side to it.  That's when you're allowed to and nobody said anything.  Oh, no one said anything. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  It was just.  She's wearing a little more makeup under her eye one day.  She goes out to get the mail and none of the neighbors even questioned her.  At the Brown Derby.  The waiter at the Brown Derby puts her in a dark lit booth.  To cover up some fucking dosing.  Some world of hurt that fucking Mr. Burton might have done.  Yes.  Oh, that's great.  The Brown Derby.  So we lose, uh, we lose Elizabeth Taylor today.  Ah, hey, they know it.  We hardly knew ye.  Yeah.  Adios. 
[02:32:30]  Goodbye.  She, uh, she hung in there for quite a while.  Like, I thought she was going to die years ago.  She'd been dying for years.  Who's that she's with?  Now they're showing all our clips.  Now we got to look at her.  Okay.  Here we go.  I'd rather look at fucking Libya.  See what's going on there.  So sad about Elizabeth Taylor.  She will be missed.  Oh, is it the Twitters?  I love, I love reading Twitter when someone dies.  Death Twitters, the serious ones? 
[02:33:00]  Here's one.  Heaven has gained another angel.  No, someone didn't actually put that.  Oh yeah, they did.  People are fucking weird, man.  I'll be having fun with this later.  You never notice because you don't hang out with people that would be like that.  But through Twitter and shit, you're able to see that people are just fucking weirdos.  Yeah.  That's coming from me.  Oh, here's one.  You ready for this one?  Yeah.  You will forever be beautiful.  How does...  No, she's going to rot in a box.  Right. 
[02:33:30]  She's going to be in a box.  There's no beauty in rotting.  No.  There's none there.  At some moment, that jaw is going to drop when she dries out and the bone goes, like  in an Indiana Jones movie.  Here's one with dead seriousness in the tweet.  I know you and Michael Jackson are just having a blast in heaven.  Michael Jackson's in heaven?  What the fuck?  And then this guy goes, I'm taking a personal day.  He's just so bummed.  He's taking a personal day.  Come on, that's not true.  I swear to God. 
[02:34:00]  Come on, that guy's got to be gay.  Got to be.  And there's no...  No...  What's the word?  Irony?  No.  No irony behind this?  He's not taking a personal day.  Yes, he's bummed out.  He's taking a personal day.  Believe me, it's the snow.  It's not Elizabeth Taylor.  That's why he's taking a...  I don't mind a corny, you know, the little cliche, R.I.P.  You know what I mean?  I don't mind that.  You know, you put rest in peace, but whatever, like that.  But these scenarios of this heavenly get-together.  But who's not resting in peace?  I know, but...  You all rest in peace, man.  Out of respect, I don't mind that one. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  But not like, you know, oh, you know, a comedian dies.  Oh, he's up there with George Carlin right now.  They're cracking jokes.  No, they're not.  Yeah, they're cracking jokes.  Really?  Are they?  No.  I don't think so.  Princess Jess writes, oh my God, Elizabeth Taylor has died.  So, so sad.  Oh.  R.I.P.  Liz, you were one amazing lady.  Oh.  Why is it sad?  She had a great life.  She almost made 80.  That's a nice contract.  Richard Burton belted her in the mouth right at the pearly gates.  Yeah.  Just fucking unloaded on her face. 
[02:35:00]  Get the fuck in here.  I've been waiting for years to fucking get you up here.  Haven't had a warm dinner in decades.  Get the fuck in here.  Can't get arrested in heaven.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Let's see what else is coming in.  Any other sweet...  A lot of so sads.  Is there a hashtag going on for this?  Hashtag Miss Taylor?  R.I.P.  Elizabeth Taylor.  Oh, wow.  That's what I'm reading right now.  But also, they started National Velvet as well.  It's a trending topic.  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  Let's see what it is.  National Velvet. 
[02:35:30]  Her movie when she was merely a teen.  I can't wait to read the celebrity ones, because they're just obnoxious about this shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to read one from Norm MacDonald.  Have you been reading Norm's tweets?  Norm rules.  No.  Norm is great, man.  I don't know.  I didn't even know.  You didn't know?  I've got to follow him.  Norm MacDonald is one of the funniest motherfuckers.  And it hasn't stopped.  He's great.  Let's see if Gilbert tweets about Elizabeth Taylor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  Let's see.  Well, you know, that would be...  I think that would...  The white female he's allowed to pick on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He could pick on that.  He just, you know...  That sucks that he got fucking in trouble from that shit.  It's like, meh.  I guess he should have known better.  What are you going to do?  It's funny how all these highly liberal celebrities are coming out and supporting Japan, and they're  having, you know...  Oh, yeah.  The little TV telethons that are answering the phones to raise money.  Where's that?  I don't know.  Where's that?  It's weird.  I haven't heard of anybody.  Sandra Bullock donated a million dollars. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, she did?  Nice.  Other than that, I haven't heard of anybody.  I don't think they need money, though.  It's weird.  Why do they need money?  Yeah, they kind of don't need money.  I guess, you know, for...  They're the third largest economy in the world.  Yeah, they got cash.  Like, if something horrible happens in America, do we actually need money from other countries?  Would be nice.  Never do, though.  I don't know.  What do you think?  After 9-11, they were fucking, you know, oh, let's chip in some money.  Yeah, they were paying money to buy shit.  I don't think they need money yet.  Buying all our fucking property.  The Chinese.  No more good ones coming in. 
[02:37:00]  They're all just saying, so, so sad.  Terrible.  Oh, my God.  Here's a good one.  She's with Richard now.  Oh.  The true love of her life.  Oh, come on.  Are you serious?  She's got an ice pack on her eye right now.  It's like, really?  I just got here.  Can you let me put my bags down before you belt me one?  Fucking burden.  He hit her and went, wow, this now truly is heaven.  Yeah, that's the shit you should be tweeting, not fucking, she's with Richard Burton now. 
[02:37:30]  Give me a break.  Didn't they, this fucking.  She's got seven other husbands up there.  Yeah, yeah.  Who does she go to?  Yeah, well, which one does she go to?  You know, does the other guy get jealous?  How does that work in heaven?  Yeah, that's why that heaven thing is really strange.  I was waiting for you.  Oh, really?  So it was I and I and I and I.  It was what happens to the guy that's married to his wife for 40 years and she passed away  and then he gets remarried like two years later.  Yeah.  And has a second wife for like 15. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  And then they, you know, she dies and then he dies six months later.  So he's got two wives up there.  Who does he go to?  Danny's saying that gang bang in heaven.  They allow it.  They allow the gang bang.  And the girls aren't jealous anymore.  All of a sudden, they're crazy emotions.  No, there's no jealousy in heaven or anything.  Yeah.  Well, what the fuck is that?  Guys, here's one.  Yeah.  R.I.P., Elizabeth Taylor.  Say hi to M.J.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:38:30]  If you can get him off that boy in heaven.  Yeah.  So there's no jealousy in heaven then.  So you can like be there with your wife for 40 years and go, oh, and her friend's there.  And you're like, oh, you know what?  I always wanted to fuck her.  I'm going to fuck her right in front of her.  Yeah.  She's going to go, okay, just tell me when you're done.  I'm going to go get a drink.  Yeah, I'm fine with it now.  It's really what about that fucking Titanic, that movie Titanic?  Didn't the old broad wasn't she married at some point in her life?  Because she had like a daughter, right?  So then she dies and she's back on the fucking Titanic with the guy that she was with for 
[02:39:00]  fucking 10 minutes.  And the husband that she spent all that time with that was dead.  Where's he?  Yeah, where is he?  He just gets his shit out of luck.  God, are you right?  He put in the years.  Yeah.  What a faggot I am.  What am I talking about that for?  Do you really want to see your wife after 40 years?  You know, she passed away, you moved on.  No.  Yeah, and then do you look like you did when you died?  So now is it old Liz Taylor and like Richard Burton from years ago?  Or do you get to pick when the fuck? 
[02:39:30]  All right, I want to be like when I was 29 or something.  It doesn't make any sense.  Oh, you're all of a sudden healthy?  Yeah.  She doesn't have a heart problem now?  Yeah, she's not in a wheelchair.  What is that?  It's all bullshit.  That's what I say.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  We'll see when the apocalypse was going down.  That's right.  Well, you guys will.  Let me know because I'll be in the woods somewhere in Vermont being chased by a bear.  We're not closing in on you.  You'll be saying your prayers.  Yes.  I'll continue reading the Liz Taylor tweets, but we also have to do the biggest story of 
[02:40:00]  the day, Chris Brown, before the Marine guy from Avatar comes in here.  Stephen Lang.  Stephen Lang, yes.  He was great in Avatar.  Yes.  He was also...  He'll be in the upcoming Conan the Barbarian movie.  Yes.  Chris Brown.  Wow.  What a dummy.  He was just about over this Rihanna thing and he lost his mind yesterday on GMA.  Or right after his interview with GMA is when the real shit went down.  Uh-huh.  And Robin Roberts was just asking him some questions about Rihanna. 
[02:40:30]  And he was getting like a little uptight during the interview.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And supposedly she asked him before, a producer asked, can he ask about Rihanna?  He said, okay, before the interview.  Right.  So she knew to ask those questions.  Ah.  And so, yeah, well, he just showed that he does have an anger problem.  Yeah.  He finally showed the whole world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got an anger problem.  He was able to kind of sweep that away a little bit, but now, fuck.  He's fucked.  You go on there with a cliche answer.  Hey, man, I put a, you know, I got help. 
[02:41:00]  I put a pass to me.  Right, right.  You know, I'm moving on and, you know, hopefully.  Yeah.  That's all you got to say.  But he can't get through the anger.  He was so fucking mad.  He was throwing, what, a chair through a window and glass was falling down to the street in Times  Square, very, very close to where we broadcast, as a matter of fact.  And then took his shirt off.  Took his shirt off and this was like a raving lunatic on the streets for a while.  I hope David's okay.  Breaking news.  Bus blast in Jerusalem.  Where's our David?  David, call back David.  Two dead after explosion in Jerusalem. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Here's Robin Roberts.  Brings up the last time she talked to Chris Brown and asked about what's changed.  Chris Brown riding high.  Brand new CD out.  Fame.  It's out today.  Already has three number one hits, a fourth one climbing the charts, and the album is  number one on iTunes today.  It's a far cry from the last time the two of us sat down, just months after he pled guilty  to felony assault.  He took responsibility for hitting his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, and has spent the last two years  rebuilding his life and career. 
[02:42:00]  My hair has grown a great deal since the last time I saw you, too, Chris Brown.  How are you?  I'm pretty good, yeah.  Everything's good, yeah.  And thank you for sitting down for just a moment before.  It's all about the music.  I think your fans are here, but you have been very good about talking with me a little bit  about this because we've gone through it and talked about it when I went to your home.  What's going on now is that recently the restraining order against you that Rihanna had issued has been relaxed.  Have you all, you can go to events and be in the same room. 
[02:42:30]  Have you all seen each other, been around each other?  I mean, not really.  I mean, it's not really a big deal to me now as far as that situation.  I think I'm past that in my life.  And I think today is the album day, so that's what I'm focused on.  So everybody go get that album.  And that is something that we are here to talk about, but thank you very much for willing  to do that.  He's so sick of talking about Rihanna, but look, man.  Hey, he belted her.  You belted her?  Yeah.  What do you expect?  So, you know, Robin Roberts just keeps bringing it up. 
[02:43:00]  Fame.  F-A-M-E.  Yeah.  What does that stand for?  Fame.  Forgiving all my enemies and definitely fans of my everything.  And that meaning, like, you know, being able to go through everything I went through  and show my fans that I love them, you know.  That's what it is.  And fans of my everything.  When you say forgive all your enemies, who do you consider your enemies?  Just anybody.  Naysayers, haters, whatever the case may be.  I just think, you know, being positive and promoting that is what I'm about.  And that's what I'm going to do.  Yeah.  But you can understand how some people, you know, that was very serious what you went 
[02:43:30]  through and what happened.  And even the judge, though, afterwards said that you had served your time as far as the  community service and that and move it on.  But have you been able to?  How have you been able to?  I've been focusing on his album, you know.  I think this album is what I want people to hear and I want people to really get into.  So definitely this album is what I want them to talk about and not the kind of stuff that  happened two years ago.  I understand that.  I understand that.  And thank you for allowing me to go back that way because there have been a lot of people 
[02:44:00]  that were tweeting about it.  You just keep bringing up that fucking album.  Yeah.  I didn't realize GMA had those sound effects during the interview.  Oh, that wasn't a sound effect.  That was him punching her in the face because she wouldn't stop asking him the same dumb  question.  He wanted to talk about the album.  She doesn't want to answer.  She wanted to know more about Rihanna because she was going for the moment, obviously.  Yeah.  She wanted to get a rise out of him.  He's a scumbag, but really, what more could he add?  I think he is a scumbag.  Like, what more can he add to this whole thing, though?  Like, she fucking, so what, we all know what happened. 
[02:44:30]  He beat the fuck out of her.  He went to court.  He got what he got.  And, like, what more is this bitch fishing for?  Yeah, all he has to say is, look, I had a bad night that night.  My dad used to beat the shit out of my mom.  Ah, that's a good one.  Supposedly it's true.  And, you know, I learned from it.  I went to therapy.  I, you know, did my community service.  And that's never going to happen again in my life.  That's all you got to say.  And there's really no more else to say about it.  Just do it like that.  No, have that prepared statement going in.  Yeah.  And my album. 
[02:45:00]  I had a tweet yesterday.  I said, good to see Chris Brown has taken out his frustration on his founding career on a window and not Rihanna's face.  See, he has learned.  He has.  He throws chairs now instead.  He throws chairs and windows instead of punching a bitch.  But, you know what, in this guy's defense, a lot of guys have beat up their women before.  But now with TMZ and all this stuff going on, the pictures on the internet, you know, he's, if he would have done this ten years ago, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal.  Yeah.  There's a lot of guys that have done that before, you know, beat up their wives.  And the pictures weren't all over TMZ and every site as soon as they came out, too. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what they got now.  He picked a bad time to give her a punch.  Back in the old days, you could belt abroad.  And finally, Robin asked Chris about the people standing by him.  This is the last clip.  And then all hell broke loose.  Unfortunately, not on live TV.  But you do see the people that are out here.  And it is about your music.  And they have stood by you.  So, through thick and thin.  So, what is it about the music for you that helps you? 
[02:46:00]  You know, it enables me to, you know, escape and be able to reach my fans.  Because I think when you come to mainstream America and you come to different places in the world,  people always want to, you know, bring what the situation we're bringing up now.  And I think eventually it's just about my fans, you know.  It's not about that.  Like, I'm doing this for my fans.  So, I could care less what anybody else thinks.  Well, no, you cared a lot.  I could care less.  It got to you.  And then you destroyed the...  Chris Brown's got, like, a whole fan club on Twitter.  If you say something bad about them, they attack you. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, really?  I think after this, because I did it again, because I've done it before,  with his bad sweater vests and his bow ties that he wears,  how corny and awful he is, and his music.  And they always come at you.  But I think after this, they're like, there's too many people tweeting about him.  They can't...  They can't come at you.  They can't fight the battle right now, right?  All right.  Well, there you go.  Actually, Stephen Lang is here.  Well, let's bring him down.  Let's bring him in.  He's here.  Yeah?  Want to bring him down now?  Or you want to take a quick break?  What do you want to do?  We should take a quick break. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  We'll do a quick break.  Stephen Lang from Avatar fame, of course, and other things.  We're going to find out what he's up to.  He's promoting white Irish drinkers.  White Irish drinkers.  Yes.  So we'll talk about that and other things.  Stay there.  Series 197 XM 202.  The virus.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:47:30]  Hanging with Jim Florentine today.  Meet the Creeps, Volume 3, out today, featuring Club Soda Kenny.  I got my copy.  I can't wait to go home and check this out.  You got to see the bit where it's on my website, JimFlorentine.com, where I'm in a wheelchair  playing a comic in Vegas on one of those big stages.  And Jamilson's heckling me.  And I tell him to fuck off.  He's like, oh, really?  He comes on stage and throws me off the stage in the wheelchair into the crowd.  Because he's like, I'm funny than you.  And he's like, I'm just trying to do my job. 
[02:48:00]  And he picks the mic up as I'm laying there.  And he's like, so how about these penny slots in Vegas?  He starts doing an act as people are trying to pick me up and put me back in the wheelchair.  And no one recognized that was you?  No, I had a bad fishing hat on.  And I was all, no, they didn't know.  We did it a couple years ago, but they had no idea.  And how did you set it up with the club?  I knew the club and a friend was the emcee.  It was like an open mic night on a Monday night.  There was like 15 people in the audience.  Wow.  Nice.  Brutal.  And he dumps me right out of the wheelchair.  It's beautiful.  Give me one more bit for Meet the Creeps straight.  Club Soda Kenny. 
[02:48:30]  We go into a pizza place, me and Jamis, and we say, how much is a pie?  The woman goes, 15 bucks.  I'm like, wow, that's a lot.  I go, hold on.  I call another pizza place.  I go, can I order a pie?  Club Soda Kenny comes in as a pizza guy with another pie right in front of the girl at  the counter.  So I'm going to order a pie.  I'm like, yeah.  I go, how much?  $9.99.  She goes, you can't get a pie.  I go, well, you guys are 15.  He's only nine.  She goes, well, you can't eat it here.  I'm like, well, you guys got tables at his place.  She goes, you can't order a pie.  Wow.  So then we look at it.  I go, oh, there's no pepperoni.  So Kenny's like, hey, miss, can you put some pepperoni on this pizza, please? 
[02:49:00]  That's awesome.  And the funniest line is she's so aggravated, she's like, fuck you, get out of here.  He goes, come on, miss.  One pizza guy to another.  Like there's some camaraderie.  Oh, that's good.  That's awesome.  I love that bit.  That's fucking fun.  Very cool.  It's on jimflorentine.com.  Anywhere else you can get it?  Probably when you hit the road, right?  Yeah, I'll hit the road, yeah.  You're selling them after your shows.  This weekend, Hartford Funny Bone for Jim Florentine, right?  Yep.  All right.  Long Island in April, Bolton Center, and then Mexicali Cafe. 
[02:49:30]  And also, you're a really good one to follow on Twitter.  Not all you comics are good to follow, like Anthony has brought up, but Florentine's a  good one.  What's your...  Mr. Jim Florentine.  It is.  Okay.  I knew it was a little different.  Mr. Jim Florentine.  Mr. Jim Florentine on Twitter.  Definitely worth following.  Let's get Stephen Lang in here, please.  Yes.  Mr. Lang!  Hi, Stephen.  White Irish drinkers.  We're a little behind today.  I apologize.  You had to sit in that green room a little longer than you wanted to, I'm sure. 
[02:50:00]  It wasn't green.  It wasn't green.  It's just a crappy office.  I don't know why they call it that.  I don't know why the hell they call it that.  You lost your green room.  Yeah.  Yeah, we did.  It's an office now.  That's this company.  How did it feel to be in one of the greatest movies of all time, sir, Avatar?  Pull that headphone down for him with its side.  You all right?  I hate those headphones.  They should be...  Did it pinch your ear?  Ow!  There you go.  I'm good.  Sorry, what was that?  How was it like to be in one of the greatest movies of all time, Avatar? 
[02:50:30]  It was good, man.  It was a great movie.  Good gig.  It was a lot of fun to do.  It was a good gig.  It was...  When did you guys know that it was...  First class all the way, you know?  When did you know it was going to be as big as it turned out?  I guess after the first week or so, when it just sort of rolled...  When it grossed millions upon millions of dollars, I guess.  The first opening was in London, and people went just berserk for it, so we had a clue  then that it was pretty good, you know? 
[02:51:00]  But that's easy.  I mean, when you were filming it, did you have an idea that maybe this could be something?  No, no, no.  We thought it might crash and burn.  Yeah, because a lot of it in front of Green Street...  You know, we were getting trashed all over the place on the internet, for one thing,  which, you know, those guys with Cheeto stains on their fingers and shit.  Wait, you get haters, too?  And they were calling, you know, Smurfs...  Oh, shit.  Right.  Dances with Smurfs and stuff like that.  Dances with Smurfs.  And, you know, you read it enough, it's like, no, no, I hope not.  But then when I saw it, I knew it was kicking. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, yeah, because that was a...  That's a big one.  What about...  And you saw it the first time in 3D and everything, and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I watched it with Jim, and we had a screening, and it kind of...  You know, I hadn't seen anything.  We just work on it.  When you work on it, it's all sort of disembodied and...  Yeah, green screen.  What are you looking at, dots on the wall?  I was just...  I was pretty blown away by it.  Now, the one thing that's pretty obvious, you're obviously in good shape, but in the movie, 
[02:52:00]  you were a lot bigger.  I was about 30 pounds heavier then.  Damn.  Oh, so, okay, because we were trying to figure out if that was special effects or what.  Special effects.  No, I don't know.  It was just a lot of hard work.  You know, I was getting...  I got up at 4 every morning.  I was in the gym.  I ate a lot.  So you had to beef up for the role?  Yeah, I just got really big.  Protein.  A lot of protein shakes.  Yeah, I was lifting very, very heavy weights.  And since then, you know, I'm playing stuff that's a little leaner right now.  Right, right, right.  So I wanted to...  Yeah, it wouldn't quite work if you were a big, burly guy and what you're playing. 
[02:52:30]  It's just, well, it's hard to keep the muscle.  It's easy to keep the weight.  Right, right.  It's hard to keep it in the right place.  That's some discipline.  You think you could do that?  Get all ripped for a movie role, Jim?  For the right price, absolutely.  For some avatar money.  Yeah, for avatar money, absolutely.  When you get old, though, like me, you just, you know, you wake up early.  So it's easy.  Is that it?  You just get up early?  Yeah, it's easy, yeah.  Just to take a piss.  As long as I'm up, I might as well wake up.  I might take a little human growth hormone, HGH.  Yeah, why not? 
[02:53:00]  Along the way.  You take it for six weeks of care.  A lot of guys tried to turn me on to human growth hormone.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, clearly, it gets results.  But I don't like to do needles, for one thing.  Yeah.  And that's so funny, the character you play in Avatar, and it's like,  I don't like needles.  Ah, they hurt.  Now, White Irish Drinkers?  Oh, yeah, it's a new one.  And what is this about?  I'm intrigued by the title.  It's a cool picture. 
[02:53:30]  It's a little indie.  We did, which sounds patronizing, but it's not.  It was made on, you know, on the cheap.  But a beautiful script.  Really, it's, you know, a quote, coming-of-age story.  It's two brothers, 1970s Brooklyn.  I played a father, a longshoreman, an alcoholic, abusive.  But, and they're trying to break out.  One of them is kind of attracted toward the dark side, crime.  And the other one, he's a good boy.  And it's, so it's sort of an age-old story. 
[02:54:00]  It's kind of a tribal story in a way.  But it's played out really charmingly, I think.  And audiences dig it.  That sounds cool.  So we're going to open it on Friday.  And, you know, opening a couple of theaters in New York, a couple in L.A.  And then they're, whatever they're doing with it, trying to.  That's kind of the, yeah, the new thing to do is, like, just kind of smaller films, limited  releases, cheaper budget.  You go from, you go from Avatar, like the biggest budget, corporate kind of movie. 
[02:54:30]  And then, yeah, going to do an indie, just open it up in a few places.  You know, whatever it is.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, one of the actors in it with me is Peter Rieger, you know, from Animal House.  Oh, right.  Yeah, we just saw him on one of the news programs.  And Peter says when, he says, you know, when the camera rolls, they all cost the same.  And he's right, you know.  Yeah, that's true.  I think so.  Yeah.  Whatever that means.  Oh, that's good.  That's interesting.  I forget.  Because we saw him the other day, and we're like, oh, I wonder what he's been in.  And, yeah, they actually showed some old clips from Animal House, too. 
[02:55:00]  And Karen Allen, who was also in Animal House, plays my wife in it.  Oh, damn.  Wow, look at that.  Bringing them together again.  That was the one that Donald Sutherland was banging, right?  Yeah, Donald Sutherland was having sex with her, and he walked in.  Donald Sutherland is not in White House.  He's not in it.  No, he's not in that one.  I did a picture with Sutherland years ago with Charlie Sheen, actually.  What movie was that?  The Shadow Conspiracy, it's called.  You don't want to miss it.  Oh, okay.  I'll look for it on Netflix. 
[02:55:30]  It's a real stinker.  It was the opposite of Avatar.  Now, you know your stinkers when you see them?  Well, you know, I shouldn't say that, because I didn't see it.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  You didn't even see your own movie?  But I could smell it a mile away.  You knew it was coming?  He played Babe Ruth, too.  Really?  Yeah.  He played Babe Ruth.  91.  I did that for NBC.  Oh, shit.  And it's a wonderful movie.  Been in a few things, haven't you?  And another situation where you had to gain a lot of weight. 
[02:56:00]  But that was soft weight.  You didn't have to fucking lift for Babe Ruth.  I was 189, because the movie started in 1919, the year he got sold to the Yankees from Boston.  He was 189 pounds at the time.  He put on the weight during the ensuing years.  Then we used these sort of graduated pads.  Oh, okay.  So you didn't have to get yourself all fat.  Well, I was heavy.  Yeah, heavier than you would have liked to have been.  Yeah, I was pretty chunky.  You don't worry about your health when you have to do things like that?  Like, yeah, I'm kind of boosting my cholesterol over here. 
[02:56:30]  No, I've got to say, back in the 70s and 80s, I really did not worry about my health at all.  Yeah, huh?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Having a little bit of fun, were you?  Because I thought I was immortal.  Yeah.  Well, you're doing all right.  I'm still here.  You're still here.  So how did you get into it back then, into acting?  Oh, I just, you know, as a kid, I'd watch things like The Lone Ranger and Robin Hood and Sergeant  Preston of the Yukon, and I thought, I want to do that, you know? 
[02:57:00]  Sergeant Preston of the Yukon.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I think I missed that one growing up.  Yeah, I don't know that one either.  I just wanted to, and, you know, watching Errol Flynn movies.  It was just guys, people jumping around with swords, bows, and arrows, and riding on horses.  Sort of appealed to you.  Kissing Olivia de Havilland, you know, which I have not gotten to do.  And like Flynn.  Yes, exactly.  And like Flynn, baby, that's right.  Exactly.  And I saw that you were the guy, now we played this clip a lot that was on Larry King, when 
[02:57:30]  Larry King had his famous misquote of, you can't handle the truth.  What did he say?  It's true.  What did he say?  Larry was a great supporter of that show.  You know, I was Colonel Jessup on Broadway with the thing.  And Larry loved the show.  He had me on, and he misquoted it.  He really misquoted it.  I think it was, you don't know the truth, or you wouldn't know.  You don't know what you're talking about.  You wouldn't know the truth if you fell over it. 
[02:58:00]  I said, well, actually, it's you can't handle the truth.  I'm trying to find the clip.  That's it.  It's a classic.  We missed Larry.  We used to beat him up all the time, man.  I tell you, I did him fairly recently, and there were like four of us.  It was Cameron and Sigourney and Sam Worthington and myself.  And Larry was great.  He orchestrated it beautifully.  I mean, the guy could do a great interview, I think.  Yeah, yeah, he was kind of, like, with lines like that, he wasn't so good. 
[02:58:30]  He would come apart every so often.  But, yeah, he did know how to handle an ensemble interview.  You've got to forgive him, though, don't you, Tate?  Of course.  The guy's been in the business forever.  Actually, you don't have to forgive him.  Get out of the business.  We could forgive him, but we could also play the clips of him because it was very entertaining.  When we've done that, it's like, oh, boy.  I see that Liz Taylor passed away.  Yes, we seem to have lost Liz Taylor.  The only experience I ever had with her was I was on a plane with her one time and engaged  eyes with her. 
[02:59:00]  And I can tell you that she had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen on an actress.  She always had the, a lot of people have said that.  She was extraordinary.  Her and Lucille Ball, most beautiful eyes.  Beautiful when Richard Burton wasn't putting his fists into them, I guess.  Well, you know, you know how it goes.  Well, hey, he wasn't known as the nicest guy to be married to.  What am I going to say?  Look, he's given us, he's given us, not quite Camelot at that house. 
[02:59:30]  He's given us a nice moment.  Well, it was a nice moment.  I was just trying to bring a little reality into it.  I'm saying something nice about Liz Taylor.  I know.  Of course, it had to turn to shit.  We all know she, we all know she took a few to the face, but we don't have to tell  Richard Burton was, you know.  He didn't.  Who hasn't?  Yeah, come on.  Come on.  Especially in Hollywood.  Let's move on.  It's like the thing to do.  Steve's like, I'll play a little bit, but you do realize I was an avatar, assholes.  You know, I got Conan the Barbarian. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  As he shamelessly pitches his project.  No, that guy was reading that, too.  Now, what is this about?  You're going to be in Conan the Barbarian?  It's coming out in August.  I'm Kalar Zim, the baddest-ass warlord who ever walked the planet.  All right, well, that's pretty cool.  Anyway.  Who's Conan?  His name's Jason Momoa, and he is good.  Yeah.  He's a total stud.  He's the kind of guy that chicks, women are going to love, and guys are going to be non-threatened  by it.  They're going to like him as well, you know.  I think he's going to do great.  Yeah, big guy.  And, of course, obviously he's going to be compared to Arnold, because that's kind of 
[03:00:30]  a...  Yeah, he is, but he's very different.  He's big, but he's much lighter than Arnold.  You know, Arnold was kind of blocky.  Yeah, just a tad.  Would that be a way to put it?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, this guy is...  I just think he's great.  He's really barbaric, too.  Where was that film?  We made it in Bulgaria, which is where you go to do barbarian films.  Is that where you go?  I never knew that.  A lot of roasted meat there, you know, and stray dogs.  Is it harder to...  Because I would imagine doing something like Avatar, you're treated pretty nicely, a nice 
[03:01:00]  trailer and things like that.  When you're in Bulgaria filming a movie, I would take it like the...  They took great care of you there.  Yeah?  They took wonderful care of me there.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Is there a Bulgarian film association that comes in?  Yeah, film Bulgaria.  No, but they have great crews there.  They work really hard because, you know, there's a heavy-duty unemployment, so they're  thrilled to have their jobs.  But there are a lot of great craftsmen. 
[03:01:30]  It's a good place to make a picture.  Yeah.  I think it's got its challenges, of course, but I've been in many worse places, believe me.  Really?  Where's, like, the worst place you had a film?  Hazard, Kentucky.  Sorry.  Really?  I did a picture with Seagal.  Worse than Bulgaria?  Yeah, I did a picture with Seagal down in Hazard, Kentucky.  Yeah.  Which film was that?  It's called...  It's a little number called Far Down Below.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that was one of his later ones.  Yeah.  Far Down Below.  It's Far Down Below.  Aptly titled, I might add. 
[03:02:00]  That part of Kentucky, worse than Bulgaria.  I think the town itself was based on a feud, was founded on a feud, like a Hatfield-McCoy  type thing.  And you could actually feel the kind of, um, the negativity and the hatred in the air  all the time there.  And nobody, the entire time I was there, nobody was ever nice to me.  Oh, shit.  And I lived, I lived in a place, and it had this weird name, like, you know, the Fleur  de Lis, or something sort of French thing down in Hazard, Kentucky, and there was a yellow  jacket nest on my window, so that was a bad thing. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, that's, I can't open the window.  But that was, you know, maybe they've cleaned it up, maybe they've solved their problems,  down there, but that was not a great place.  Probably not.  If it's based on a feud, I don't think they clear that thing up in a few years.  What, did you like anything about Bulgaria, before we move on?  I loved Bulgaria.  But what did you do when you weren't filming?  You get to check it out a little bit?  Oh, I worked out.  That was it?  Pretty much.  I read a lot.  I walked on Sofia, which is the capital.  I went to the, I went to all the things to see there, and that took an hour and a half. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, really?  What's the big thing to see there?  I don't even know.  Well, the cathedral, I guess, and they probably have some relics there, you know, some bones  or something.  But if you get out into the countryside, first of all, the Black Sea is beautiful.  Of course, I wasn't there, but I'm told.  So I'm told.  There are lots of wonderful fields there, you know.  That's a lovely field out there.  Look at that.  The grass and everything.  Many goats. 
[03:03:30]  It's, you know.  Well, it sounds nice.  It is.  It's a lovely place.  The people are splendid.  The food is, you know, it's okay.  It's all right.  It's okay.  But it's a good place to make a movie.  Is the beard for a role very Hemingway?  This is for Terranova.  It is.  My new thing with, it's a series for Fox, which Spielberg is producing.  Well, that's, well, that's pretty good.  It's a time travel. 
[03:04:00]  What's that about Mr. Involved in a lot of stuff right now?  Yeah, it's like, I'm busy.  Hey, listen, I'm riding a wave.  What can I tell you?  That's great, man.  What's that one about?  Don't break my balloon.  No, no, please.  It could end at any time.  You know, it's funny, because we were talking about Arthur before, and Dudley Moore did Arthur  too, and it was really bad.  Like, at that point, when he was rolling, he only had a couple films under his belt.  Do you take that Arthur too with a shitty script for, you know, a few million, knowing it  sucks, but cash in now? 
[03:04:30]  Well, the answer is no.  Oh, really?  Really.  I believe the answer to that is no.  What if they came to you with a fire down below two?  Well, go with Avatar, obviously.  Well, Avatar is going to be a monster.  Yeah, that would be a monster.  There's Avatar two and three, which are being, you know, readied even as we speak.  Definitely.  Did you already do your part for Avatar?  Oh, no, I shouldn't say we, because, you know, ostensibly I'm dead.  Right.  Ah, they bring you back.  You were too good at Avatar.  You never know.  You never know.  You don't know. 
[03:05:00]  Sure.  They bring you back.  Who knows?  But, no, I think you've got to be careful about what you do.  I mean, as long as you know the reason.  You do something for money, that's one thing.  You know, you do it for location.  That's another thing.  But, basically, I do things right now.  Like, I did, I certainly didn't do White Irish Drinkers for the money, and I didn't do it  for the location, which is Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, which, you know, I can go there any time I  want.  But the script was so moving, and the role was so challenging to me. 
[03:05:30]  It was a spooky role for me to play, because, you know, this guy is a fairly dark character,  I think.  Who plays the kids?  The kids are terrific.  Boy, the new fellas.  The young guy is Nick Thurston and Jeffrey Wigland, and they are just splendid.  They actually brought tears to my eyes when I saw the work that they did, because, you  know, see young guys who, and these kids are sort of looking up to me on the set, but I  got so much from them.  It sounds kind of Pollyanna, but it's true. 
[03:06:00]  I just thought they were great.  Yeah.  And I think they're going to do really well in the business, you know?  What's the Spielberg project you were just talking about?  Terranova.  It's a series, time travel.  I play Commander Nathaniel Taylor.  That sounds pretty cool.  I like time travel stuff.  Yeah, I travel back 85...  It starts in the year 2149, and I travel back 85 million years through a little tear in the  time space.  85 million years?  That's what I said.  Jeez.  That's going back a ways.  Okay.  85 million years, and I found a colony called Terranova, and I attempt to, you know, create 
[03:06:30]  a new civilization and fight dinosaurs at the same time.  Damn.  Wow.  It's a hoot.  It's great.  Wow.  Damn.  No, believe me.  I like that.  It starts next fall.  I love time travel shit.  It's great.  Let me ask you.  If there's an apocalypse, do you have an escape plan?  You're talking about the comet?  No, I'm just talking about, like, a real escape plan, because we were talking about 
[03:07:00]  the comet.  Making fun of me.  Oh, you mean right now?  Yeah.  Like a go-bag.  Do you have a go-bag?  Oh, no.  But I worry about apocalypse now, because my career is going well, you know?  So something's got...  It's like that T-shirt, you know, nuclear blast going off, and I've got a thought bubble  going, how will this affect my career?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  I mean, where are you going to go?  Well, that's just it.  I have no idea.  I'll go home.  Well, you'll just go home?  I told you. 
[03:07:30]  Just go home.  I'll go upstate, you know?  Upstate, all right.  Yeah, see?  You go upstate, just away.  Away.  I'll pour a couple of vodkas with my wife.  There you go.  Toast at each other.  Captain Morgan.  Have a little, you know, something to eat.  That sounds nice, right?  There's no boats in your escape or anything like that, or satellite phones.  Who are you voting to?  Don't look at me.  Look at that.  He's making fun of me.  There's likely to be a lot of water involved if there's an apocalypse. 
[03:08:00]  Well, that's a good point.  So I don't want to be on the seas.  Right.  No, I didn't think of that.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to think of these things.  That's a good one.  I thought of the satellite phone, the weaponry.  What's the satellite phone?  Show them.  Hey, how are you?  Well, just in case you've got to call somebody and you don't get cell service.  Show them.  Show them your satellite phone.  Well, he's seen satellite phones before.  I have a satellite phone because I got lost hiking with a girl once and vowed that I would  never get lost again without some kind of communication. 
[03:08:30]  So I have a satellite phone now.  But it's also good just in case you have to get in touch with somebody if there is some  kind of catastrophe.  No, you're right.  If you're walking along and you get your foot caught in a bear trap, you should be able to  call somebody if you're too much of a wussy to cut your own foot off.  To cut my own foot off.  Well, I wouldn't be able to do that.  Although I do have things in my...  You have the chainsaw?  I have the saw and a medical kit and everything.  It's a go bag.  It's something to grab real quick just in case the proverbial shit hits the fan. 
[03:09:00]  If something apocalyptic does happen, are you going to go for the chainsaw?  No, a little too messy and noisy in Hollywood.  I'd rather just stick to a couple of 45s and things like that.  My bottle of Captain Morgan.  A little Coca-Cola.  The Captain is making a comeback.  It really is.  Have you seen this?  It's such a great beverage.  I really do enjoy it.  And that's a good word, too.  Yeah.  Beverage.  Beverage.  Yeah.  Because it's not just a drink. 
[03:09:30]  It's so enjoyable in so many ways.  I love Captain Captain.  I do.  And the vodka.  He likes the vodka, too.  What kind of vodka do you like?  Any in particular?  I like Kettle One.  Kettle's good, yeah.  You know?  And I'll tell you, I love Smirnoff.  Smirnoff?  A lot of people...  I mean, it's a great...  It's a really good vodka.  I know.  Yeah.  A lot of people are like, oh, that's old school.  It consistently wins in taste tests.  Ah.  The Smirnoff diet.  Smirnoff.  Smirnoff is good.  And I like to say it also. 
[03:10:00]  Smirnoff.  Give me Smirnoff.  Very good now.  Where are you originally from?  Queens.  You are from Queens?  Queens, New York.  Oh, damn.  What part?  What part?  A lot of Queens guys.  Yeah.  Queens.  I'm from Jamaica States.  Jamaica?  It's a very nice spot.  Jamaica.  Yeah.  So were you, what, Mets fan, I guess?  Well, you know, I came up rooting for the Yanks, and then the Mets came, and I, of course,  started to root for them, but I never lost my love for the Yankees.  For the Yankees, yeah.  Because, you know, also, I'm of that generation, you know, Casey was the manager, right, for 
[03:10:30]  the Yanks, and then Casey went over to the Mets, so it was sort of a...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A very natural thing, and you have to understand that the Mets represented no sort of a threat  to the Yankees at all.  I mean, it was possible to love both teams.  And in the Mayor's Trophy game, I used to root for the Mets, and when they met in the  World Series, of course, I root for the Mets, but I still, you know, I love the Yanks.  Yeah, I've always been a Yankee fan, but if the Yankees get knocked out, and for some 
[03:11:00]  reason the Mets are still in it, I would root for the Mets.  I never subscribed to this, you gotta root for one or the other.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I love?  I love New York.  I really do.  I'm from New York, and if it's New York, I root for it.  That's the way it is.  So you remember then in Queens when the Jets were playing at Shea Stadium?  I do.  I went to the game.  I remember Broncos.  I used to go to those.  You know, Joe Willey.  I remember when they were the Titans, for God's sake.  Emerson Boozer.  Em Boozer, and Jim, what was his name?  Sherm Plunkett, who was the only 300-pound lineman in the NFL at the time, right? 
[03:11:30]  It was really weird thinking that I watched football at Shea Stadium, though, you know?  Yeah.  I went to one game, I saw the Denver Broncos and the Jets play.  I remember going to a game, my dad took me, and I was horrified in the bathroom, because  I had to go to the bathroom, and it was just a giant room with a trough in there, and I  was just like, eh, I don't like this, all the crowdedness.  You know, that's a very apt metaphor for Shea Stadium, which I've always characterized 
[03:12:00]  as the biggest municipal urinal on the planet, you know?  It's about the size of it.  And now that it's gone, I don't miss it at all.  I thought you were going to get nostalgic for a second.  No, no.  Have you been to any games at Citi Field?  Yeah, I like it.  I actually like Citi Field.  I've sat in a number of places, and it's a pretty good ballpark.  And the new Yankee Stadium?  I haven't been there.  It's beautiful.  I mean, I kind of, a lot of people are like, oh, I don't like the idea that they're tearing  down these older stadiums and putting the new ones up.  So they're beautiful, and they kind of build them with a very retro look to them, and really 
[03:12:30]  you could see the game, you could hear the announcements, there are places to shop.  You know, they're making money off of it, I know, but I just think it's a lot more comfortable.  Why the hell should you just sit, not be able to see the game, not be able to hear anything?  It's uncomfortable.  You can't get anything to drink or eat.  So I kind of like these new ballparks.  Well, I mean, I think it's fine they rebuilt it.  I mean, I guess it would be very tough for Fenway, or for Wrigley, for example, to do 
[03:13:00]  that.  But Yankee Stadium, I don't know, I miss it, but whatever.  Yeah, it was one of those things where you're like, nostalgic for two seconds, and then you  go to the new one, and you're like, okay, screw the old joint.  This is pretty cool, yeah.  There's no line in a bathroom.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to have to piss at a trough.  Ample, ample bathroom space.  It's an amazing place, holy shit.  Where do you live now, is it?  I live, well, I live half in Manhattan, up in Harlem, and way up, you know, in a little 
[03:13:30]  village.  Way up?  In Columbia County.  Oh, really?  Yeah, which is quite nice up there.  Okay, that's, and, you know, come back and forth.  Getting out of the, you're not like a city, you're not really a city guy?  No, I'm in town a lot.  Oh, you are?  I love the city, but I love to go up there, and my wife loves to be up there, and, you  know, gardening, and stuff like that.  How does that work when you're on a movie set?  Did your wife come with you?  Are you gone for a few months?  Well, she didn't come to Hazard, Kentucky.  Right.  Lucky her.  She came to Bulgaria for four days.  Right.  I was there for ten weeks. 
[03:14:00]  She said, should I come?  I said, come for no longer than a week.  And, but, you know, going to Australia next month, and she's coming to Australia.  Oh, wow.  The time, so it's all about location, and, you know, we're together a long time, so it's  not like we're going anywhere.  You know what I mean?  I mean, if I don't see you for six months, it doesn't really affect me.  It's not like you're going to come home, and she's going to be gone.  As a matter of fact, it only makes it better.  It makes it better, absolutely.  Is this the first time to Australia, or?  No, I did a picture there about ten years ago, and then we were there filming the first 
[03:14:30]  couple of episodes in November and December, right before the, you know, the fiasco, the  catastrophe.  Yeah, yeah, because they had their earthquakes and floods and everything else.  Amazing.  It was terrible there.  Yeah, we had some bad weather.  We went to a place to film.  We went thousands and thousands of miles to encounter the worst weather possible.  Perfect.  Yeah.  Always happens.  You, uh, uh, the people that, that's one place, like, I always wanted to go.  It seems like the people are really kind of cool, especially to, uh, Americans. 
[03:15:00]  They like us there.  Yeah.  And they're, which is nice, because, you know, it's easy to go to a lot of places on the  planet now where we're not the ugly American.  Yes.  But they like us there a lot, and they're, they're not unlike us in a way.  There's something kind of, um, I don't know, they're very embracing, they're very, uh,  uh, gregarious in their way.  They're, uh, they're a lot of fun.  They're good people.  Well, kind of the same kind of people that were thrown out of where they came from. 
[03:15:30]  And, uh, you know, England, of course, get out of here.  It's a lot of prisoners.  Hit the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I guess, uh, I always wanted to go down there though, but, uh, boy, that trip just  seems like a bitch, you must, you must first class it, right?  No coach, no coach for you.  Well, I mean, it's part of my deal.  It's part of my deal, Wade.  That's my deal.  That's my deal.  Well, uh, wow.  What a lot of projects and, uh, looking forward to, uh, your, uh, resurrection and, uh, Avatar  2. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  I'm not saying, I'm not saying anything.  You mean Avatar 2?  Avatar 2.  Avatar 2.  Let's make it official.  He's going to be in Avatar 2.  We all know.  Nothing official.  Come on.  Don't blow the gig for him.  Stop it.  Give us a scoop for once.  We need a scoop for one of you guys.  You know, the minute I know, I'll give you the scoop, but I, I, I, and I just want to  say Tombstone, of course.  Oh, well, law don't go around here.  Oh, damn.  That was a good movie.  Oh, hell yeah.  Let's not forget.  That was a damn good movie.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I like that one.  Anytime that one's filmed. 
[03:16:30]  Where was that filmed?  Uh, we filmed that, uh, we were in Tucson for about, uh, four months.  We used to film in a little town called Mezcal, which is about 50 miles away.  Wow.  That was a, that was a quite a shoot.  That was real old time.  And that shoot.  Yeah, yeah, it was.  Great movie, though.  Anytime that's when I watched it.  Only time I ever ended up in the hospital was after that shoot.  Really?  I had a barrage of kidney stones because I realized I hadn't had a drink of water in  over four months.  Wow.  Living on tequila.  All right.  I like this guy. 
[03:17:00]  I think he likes, I think he likes his drink.  No, I'm good now, but that was method acting.  I'm good now.  To the stupid.  You know, you have to.  Yeah, but we got to mention Tombstone, of course, too.  Stephen Lang, very cool.  Yeah, Stephen Lang, White Irish Drinkers.  That's, uh, out this Friday.  Friday, yeah, it's going to be open.  Go see it.  It's a good picture.  It sounds cool.  I like the smaller, I like the smaller films these days, to tell you the truth.  But it's got a big heart.  It's got a big heart.  That's cool.  Big heart.  What a great selling point. 
[03:17:30]  Wow.  You've got to come back and see us, all right?  Thanks for having me on, fellas.  You're welcome.  Stephen, thanks so much.  It's great to be here.
