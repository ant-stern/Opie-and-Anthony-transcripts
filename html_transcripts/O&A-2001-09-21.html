<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous recounting of a false fire alarm in their building, focusing on their building's fire warden, Earl, whom they accused of abandoning his post and fleeing before them.  This was followed by a caller, Mike, thanking Opie for intervening in a workplace situation involving racially insensitive jokes by a coworker, Jeff Norris.  The hosts then discussed graphic videos of Taliban executions from a website, transitioning into a segment heavily featuring listener calls filled with highly offensive language expressing anger at Hillary Clinton's perceived disinterest during a presidential address.

A significant portion of the show was dominated by a profanity-laden argument between Earl and Psycho Mark, regarding the delivery of beer kegs to Ground Zero – Mark having succeeded where Earl allegedly failed.  This argument escalated with calls from Mark’s brother and other listeners, involving accusations of incompetence and personal attacks.  A conversation with stockbroker Dave provided market analysis following the September 11th attacks, discussing specific stock prices (GE, Goldman Sachs, Disney, Intel, and Exodus Communications) and the overall uncertainty.  The segment concluded with more discussion about the false fire alarm and Earl’s perceived failings.  Throughout this section, numerous callers contributed to the chaotic and offensive atmosphere.

The show continued with further stock market discussions, interspersed with listener calls and a studio guest, Paul Mercurio from *The Daily Show*.  A caller recounted a story about his severely devalued Exodus Communications stock.  The hosts also acknowledged the public's appreciation for New York City's firefighters and police officers.  A call from "Dice," attempting a serious commentary on the terrorist attacks, was repeatedly interrupted by the hosts, resulting in Dice’s angry hang-up.  WWE advertisements featuring The Rock and Booker T. were aired.

A phone interview with Mike from the band Stained followed, discussing their career, relationship with Fred Durst, and their feelings about the attacks, concluding with promotion of their upcoming tour.  The show then included more stock market talk, a debunked rumor about Kurt Angle's paralysis, further comedic bits, and commentary on the somber post-attack mood.  Mercurio shared anecdotes about *The Daily Show*'s response and Jon Stewart’s emotional monologue.  A caller impersonated Tony Soprano, and Frank Caliendo called in, discussing his career (including *Mad TV*) and the challenges of maintaining comedic tone amidst the emotional climate.

A subsequent segment focused on the aftermath of September 11th, including discussion of Jon Stewart’s *Daily Show* monologue.  Mercurio, visibly sweating profusely, was the subject of jokes.  Numerous phone calls followed, including one promoting a comedian's show, another criticizing Opie’s pen-tapping, and Scorch providing an update on a bizarre “douche or dressing” segment.  A substantial portion mocked poorly-made listener tribute songs to the attacks, using harsh and derogatory language.  The hosts also promoted a comedian’s show benefiting firefighters.  Jay Moore called in, discussing the events and a personal incident involving federal marshals.  Extended, chaotic interactions with Dice, involving bizarre benefit telethon ideas, occurred. The segment concluded with more commentary on the bad tribute songs and the aftermath of the attacks.

The show’s final segment began with a nonsensical spoken-word piece referencing September 11th, war, and random imagery, followed by a rhyming game that devolved into inappropriate rhymes.  A "What Did We Learn on the O&A Show Today?" segment featured listener calls sharing humorous and bizarre takeaways, including anecdotes about the Pope's laminates, a salesgirl's supposed Spinal Tap connection, and Mercurio's sweating.  Audio of "Donkey Earl" fleeing the building was played.  The show concluded with promotion of Mercurio's appearance at Bananas comedy club and further off-color remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York.  Nude team.  Oh man, I want to get in her pants.  What did you just say?  Nude team.  Oh man, I want to get in her pants.  Call 911.  Opie and Anthony.  Home of nude team.  I don't know how this show made it past the censors.  Right when you think we've gotten as sick as we possibly can, we take it to just about illegal. 
[00:00:30]  Daddy, I love when you touch my bad place.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  866-277-4.  Wow. 
[00:01:00]  I don't have to tell anyone that this city is on edge.  Oh yeah, our building was just evacuated.  Well, I got a problem with Fire Marshal Earl right off the bat today.  Isn't Earl great as far as being the fire?  What is it exactly?  I don't think it's Marshal.  He's the Fire Marshal.  Of the floor.  Of the floor when Pete, the engineer, isn't around. 
[00:01:30]  And Pete's not here today.  So it's Earl's job to make sure the staff of WNAW, our radio show here in New York, is out of the building.  Right, that everybody gets out of the building safe and sound, which means Earl should probably be the last person that comes out of the building, right?  Yeah, so we're on the 9th floor and we're preparing for our radio show.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let me set it up here.  And all of a sudden, Anthony and I are like, hey, what's all that noise outside the building?  Yeah, a lot of noise. 
[00:02:00]  So we climb up and look out the window, the big, huge windows we got.  Everyone is out of the building.  Everyone, except for our office.  Yeah.  And now there are fire trucks coming from all directions.  I'm like, wow, there's something big going on down there.  Yeah, I wonder what's happening.  I wonder what's happening down there.  Turns out to be our building.  Yeah.  It was so, I guess it was so scary that our sister station, which is upstairs, 1010 Winds.  1010 Winds, the news station here, fled. 
[00:02:30]  Literally, they fled.  Dropped everything and ran.  It was a ghost town upstairs.  They dropped everything and ran, not walked, ran out of the building.  Yeah.  They did everything you're taught not to do and run.  Right.  Well, do you blame anyone at this point, you know?  Not really.  So then all of a sudden, we're like, well, look at the crowd, look at the firemen.  And we finally realize it's us.  Matt Devote, one of the sales guys, he's on his cell phone calling us going,  but guys, oh, you're still there.  I was calling, hoping you wouldn't be there. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  They've evacuated the building.  What are you guys doing?  And we're like, what?  We had no clue.  So then who ran into the office?  Jeremy, I guess?  Yeah.  And then we found out that it's Earl's job to make sure we all get out of the building,  and Earl's down, you know, saving his own ass.  Earl, what is your title?  No, that's not true.  What's your title?  I'm like assistant fire warden.  I don't know.  Warden.  And that's it, assistant fire warden.  When Pete Johnson is not here, you then become? 
[00:03:30]  The head fire warden.  Right.  So, and I did say.  H. Nick.  Hey.  As far as the fire warden goes.  Melanie works at the front desk.  She came over.  She said, Wins is being evacuated.  The second I found that out, I went into your office.  I told Stinky, get out.  Let's go.  Earl, did you yell, feet don't fail me now?  No.  And you fled the building?  No.  You didn't yell, feet don't fail me now?  I could have sworn I heard that.  Stinky, is this true? 
[00:04:00]  Did he come into the office and tell us to get out?  I don't think so.  I said, let's go.  And someone said, don't be a puss.  I'm staying.  No, Earl.  The fire warden should be the last one out of the building.  Did you say, Lordy, Lord, help me?  No.  As you fled the building?  Was there an Earl-shaped cutout in the wall where you ran through it?  Like a cartoon?  I couldn't figure it out.  You're the fire warden, and you left all of your people. 
[00:04:30]  We had no clue, Earl.  I said, we're answering.  I poked my head in the office.  I went, we're on fire.  There's a fire.  Let's go.  We're answering email.  We're watching Bush's speech over our shoulders.  You guys couldn't care less.  You were, like, just standing, looking out the window.  You were, like, where's the marshmallows?  No, no, Earl.  At that point, we're, like, wow, what is going on that there's so many people outside?  We didn't know it was our building until everyone started looking up, going, look at those two idiots looking down at us.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Hi.  Not only that, Earl, what about all of us over here by the studios?  You know, it's on the other side of the building.  None of us knew anything.  Did you alert the entire floor?  That I didn't do.  That's your job.  Well, people are a little sensitive to this stuff in the city right now.  I'm just saying that when Melanie came to our side of the floor.  Give him your bullhorn, Anthony.  You should have this bullhorn on you at all times.  Do a drill.  Do a drill.  All right.  All of a sudden, you find out through whatever channels you use that there's a fireman coming to the scene here. 
[00:05:30]  No, I heard this.  There's a fire on the 13th floor.  Please evacuate me.  Okay, you heard that?  All over the building.  We don't get that in our office.  It was everywhere.  You couldn't.  I was sitting on the chain.  We did not get that announcement in our office.  I heard it.  It's not piped in on us.  Where's Soundproof Studios, dude?  Right.  Because at this point, if it's someone, you know, toasting marshmallows on the 12th floor, I'm out of this building.  Unless the studios are on the air, everyone hears it. 
[00:06:00]  We did not hear it.  I'm telling you.  And that's something we've got to look into.  Didn't hear it.  But I heard it.  Can't you run up and down the halls with the bullhorn at least and, you know, warn people?  Could help us out, Earl.  Yes.  No?  A little help, Earl?  No?  Comment?  Anything?  Nothing.  You got nothing.  Comment?  Mike, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  We're on the 15th floor over here, and we were just as dumb as you guys.  We didn't leave either.  Well, we didn't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we heard it was on the 13th floor, and we still stayed, except for our receptionist, Monica, 
[00:06:30]  who was pushing people down the steps to get out like everybody else was.  And what was it?  It turned out to be a fault.  It turned out to be like nothing, or just something that stayed straightened out, I guess, pretty quickly.  But they had the fire department here, yeah.  Oh, they had many trucks here.  And it was what a sight, because we could see from our office building on the ninth floor, Earl.  Well, as we're looking outside the building, I heard someone from that office said, oh, don't be such a puss, I'm staying.  Don't be such a puss, I'm staying.  But you're right, though.  We heard the 13th floor, and we're thinking, do we want to stay? 
[00:07:00]  You want to stay?  Well, no.  No, you're above the fire.  Of course you don't want to stay.  We were ready.  I was packed and ready to go.  Did you see the scene outside the building, though?  No, Monica did over here.  Well, what happened was, after they took care of whatever it was, the firemen are now exiting the building,  and there has to be over 1,000 people outside waiting to take back into the building.  That's what she said.  And one by one, the firemen were coming out of the building, and all the people from this building were just clapping.  Applauding them. 
[00:07:30]  It was like the rock stars were walking around down there.  It was amazing.  It was a teary-eyed moment.  All right.  Let me go, guys.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Firemen after firemen leaving the building, and everyone just breaking out into a huge applause.  Everyone's applauding.  As they're going back to their trucks.  Firemen are like rock stars now.  Yeah.  It's something, you know?  Everywhere they go, you see the, if you drive around Manhattan, you see the trucks going wherever they're going,  back to the firehouse or the scene of a fire, whatever.  And people on the sides of the road are always waving now. 
[00:08:00]  They're giving them a lot of support.  Well, it was really emotional.  It was last.  Really emotional, because some of the trucks that showed up, they're from the firehouse, very close to here.  They lost a bunch of guys.  But thanks, Earl.  Thanks for helping us out, making sure we get out of the building.  I got to say something about this building that we're in.  It seems to be bursting into flames all the time.  Like, I've never been in a building where more fire alarms have gone off.  The other night, the alarm went off.  It's always, you know, oh, there's a fire, or, you know, leave the building, firemen are investigating something. 
[00:08:30]  Man, some kind of, what are we in, a papier-mâché building?  All right, so that was some excitement just before the show today.  A little bit of excitement.  All Earl knows is that he got out okay.  Hello?  Thanks, Earl.  Earl, we've got to take the job away from you.  No offense.  Yeah, you're not a good fire warden.  I don't feel good with you being the assistant fire ward.  Dude, that's one office.  Earl.  We've got a whole...  Earl, it's going to take more than let's go. 
[00:09:00]  We had another person coming from the other side of this building saying, evacuate the building.  To who?  I didn't hear.  Didn't stick in their head in the soundproof studios we're in.  Earl, you should be running up and down the halls with that bullhorn screaming, get out of the building.  Right.  Fire alarm went off.  They're evacuating the building.  No, Pete's not here.  I understand.  But when Pete's not here, you have to step up.  That's not his primary job.  His primary job is the engineer of the station.  You tool.  Oh, it's coffee.  All right, Earl. 
[00:09:30]  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  Yo, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Peace, my fellow American brothers.  Yes.  Check it out, man.  Yesterday, I mean, Opie, did you stop Rich Voss from making comments?  You know what I'm saying?  Because I heard, like, Rich Voss talking about when you're talking to Earl.  Voss wasn't in yesterday.  Jeff Norris.  Oh, Jeff Norris.  Yeah.  And, you know, I heard a comment about swinging from the trees or something like that, and  I thought I heard you say to Norris, you know, cut that crap out.  Yeah, I did.  And, yo, I really appreciate that, you know, because, you know, my brother, he's in the 
[00:10:00]  military, and, you know, he had to ship out.  And, you know, when, you know, you got all these, one-third of the military is black  brothers, you know, and at a time like this, we need to be all connected.  I know your show gets down like that, but at this particular time, I appreciate that you  did that, man.  Well, it wasn't even, you know, I don't know, because Ant and I are guilty of trying to have  fun, but what it was was it wasn't at all clever, so it was like, Norris, cut it out.  Exactly.  You know, you're doing third grade really bad stuff right there.  But he's going through some tough times, so. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you, brothers.  Peace.  All right.  God, I got a website up someone gave me.  Yeah?  That has these video clips of what they do over there in Afghanistan, the Taliban.  Oh, my God.  I'm just watching.  I mean, they fill their little stadium up with people, and then they go into the middle  and kill their people.  What?  The public executions.  They slit their throats.  They shoot them.  It's amazing.  And this is real video? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Here's like an older...  It's none of that fake faces of death crap?  No, no.  It's real stuff.  Sounds like Latin.  Like, I'm watching a firing squad thing here, and there are two guys lined up in a firing  squad.  It looks like they didn't divvy it up equally.  So one guy went right down, and the other guy is kind of still rolling around a little  bit.  Ugh.  You want to give out that website?  Awful.  Let's see.  Yeah, I guess so.  No WWW, it seems. 
[00:11:30]  So it's just R-A-W-A, R-A-W-A, R-A-W-A, 3.hackmare.com, H-A-C-K-M-A-R-E, Hackmare.  So it's R-A-W-A, 3.hackmare.com, and then go to their movies.  You got movies of the public executions.  Public executions, an Afghan woman burnt by her husband.  That's great stuff. 
[00:12:00]  Public executions, refugee camps, and the people mass graves in Kabul.  Taliban uses cranes to hang men in public.  Let me check that one out.  Frank, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  Despicable people.  Oh, and hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Watching the speech last night like everybody else.  Yep.  Did you guys catch the puss that was on Hillary's face the whole time?  Ah, yeah, what was that about?  She looked like she had something sour for lunch, dinner, breakfast, everything. 
[00:12:30]  It's great that everyone's true colors are coming out through this crisis.  Yeah.  And everyone noticed that she could care less that she was there while the president was speaking,  trying to rally everybody to his cause.  She's like talking to Schumer the whole time.  Yep.  When they're clapping, everyone else is clapping like this.  Yeah, yeah.  Very fast.  And she's like.  Ah, I'm going to go home.  Yeah, whatever.  My roommate had a great line about what she was going through in her mind while she was with that look in her face. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Bush Sr. got a war.  Bush Jr. got a war.  And what did my president get?  Hummers in the Oval Office.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Thanks, Frank.  She's an embarrassment to this state.  Yeah, it's a shame.  I guess, you know, it wasn't her event, so she felt jaded.  We've got to be careful, though, because every time we trash Hillary, you know,  the email goes crazy that we don't know what we're talking about.  Oh, really?  We shouldn't talk politics, and we should shut our big mouths.  Ah.  Well, she's got her supporters.  She did win. 
[00:13:30]  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, how are we doing today, guys?  All right.  All right.  I just wanted to jump on the Hillary Bash and Wegg, and also, I was hoping to be the  first one to bust her bubble.  But she looked like such a effing smoke-faced C on that TV, boy, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  I hope it comes out what her problem was last night.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It looked like she just got done kissing her husband, Chuck, after he was carpet munching  on her.  You know what I mean?  It was a very important speech last night, and she had to know that the cameras were  going to be catching her in the audience. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I turned on her wife, the only thing I could possibly think it was going through  her mind was, my bill could do it so much better.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Clinton's happy he's not in office.  Gore's happy he's not in office.  I think we're all happy he's not in office, but I'm glad we got the guy in office that  we have right now, because I think he's got the boss to step up to the plate and do the  job.  Yeah.  Well, I'll have to wait and see.  So, and another thing on Rudy Giuliani.  Yeah.  Seeing as our aunt's a cartoon fanatic, what do you think about the yabba-dabba-doo thing?  Do you think he's been duplicated, or what? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, he's been duplicated.  Definitely.  He doesn't sleep, the guy.  You just see him all the time.  I think there's a few of them.  He's everywhere.  They've cloned the mayor.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  So he could be everywhere.  Yeah.  You guys rock, man.  Take care.  Fire, man.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  Let's move on to Bobby.  Bobby, what's up?  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  You had the fireman right there.  Earl had to just carry the kegs out to the truck.  I didn't even think of that.  Operation Infinite Beer was a success last night, by the way.  Yes, with the help of Psycho Mark, he did what he said he was going to do. 
[00:15:00]  He got the beer in.  Whoa.  Earl.  Earl, relax.  Easy.  Easy.  Easy.  Look at the face.  I know.  He's all pissed.  Earl, you've got to admit.  You've got to admit something.  Oh, my God.  You weren't able to get the kegs down there and Psycho Mark.  Yeah, because he's laminated up to the wazoo.  Of course he can get it in.  T-minus 10 seconds before Earl loses his effing mind. 
[00:15:30]  What do you mean?  See, I was smart enough not to go back the third time.  John Rossi went.  He goes, and he came back.  He hates Mark as much as I do now.  And he said, yeah, he's got all these laminates.  He would say he's like the Pope.  What do you mean, press laminates?  Yeah.  Well, you have press passes.  You've got to know how to talk.  Are you trying to say the Pope has a lot of laminates?  Yeah, I have never seen the Pope with laminates.  Pope walking around with backstage passes around his neck.  Backstage pass to God's mind. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, he's got the VIP laminate.  Yeah, he made a hat out of all of them.  The special VIP, not the one that only gets it backstage.  All access, mother effer.  The Pope has laminates.  The Pope has laminates, according to Earl.  No, I didn't say that.  So now I think.  You said he had more laminates than the Pope.  No, I said he was like the Pope.  You think the Pope's people are handing out other backstage passes to the hoes?  So when he gives his little address up there, he looks down. 
[00:16:30]  You get me her.  Bring her back.  Right.  Look at the blonde up front.  Get her.  Wonderful.  All right, Earl.  Put words in my mouth.  Mark was laminates.  Mark, I talked to Mark late last night.  He was laughing openly at you.  Why did I care less about Mark Walsh?  Well, the guy, Earl, all I'm saying, I'm looking at the facts here.  The guy came through where you.  He walked up to a barrier, said, hey, I'm with Fox. 
[00:17:00]  He had all these laminates.  Let these guys in.  What's the problem with Mark?  It's a pain in the ass.  That's what his problem is.  What has he ever done to you?  Yeah.  Earl?  Mark, he always seems to be bashing you, but sometimes I got to admit, he's got reason.  I mean, like yesterday, it was just a class A cluster F because I went, he calls, he goes,  can we send it down, right? 
[00:17:30]  I'm like, okay, who do I see?  Where am I going?  I was like, fine, I'll do it.  Where are we going?  He gives me nothing to go with and then yells at me for not knowing.  You didn't show the initiative that he showed in getting it there, though, Earl.  Tell me where I'm going.  Mark is a true American hero.  I think Mark came through where you did fail.  It's a true American ass.  He delivers changers.  Bobby's even getting some shots in at Earl today.  Hey, can I get an FU? 
[00:18:00]  What do you want?  Yeah, go ahead.  I want to send out a big FU to Air Force Express who gave me double the work on a Friday.  Well, you guys got some backup there, huh?  Yeah.  At least you have a job this Friday, Bobby.  That's true.  Have a good weekend, guys.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Oh, my God.  Get a napkin.  Get a napkin.  We better take a break.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what did you do?  Pete's going to kill me.  I just poured coffee all over the board.  Oh, no.  What did you do?  Are we going to start going? 
[00:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's going to short circuit at any moment.  Radio 101 right there, people.  You don't ever hold your coffee over a board.  At least it wasn't a total dunking.  Did you see how...  Looks like a couple of channels.  What are those used for, Opie?  Oh, commercials.  We don't need a button.  Oh, are they commercials?  Yeah, we don't need these buttons.  Oh, man.  That's bad.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner, will make your penis grow.  Right.  It'll just jump all over the place.  You see how the coffee was falling in slow motion? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I couldn't handle it.  I saw that.  All right, we'll take a break.  We've got to clean out the board.  We've got lots to do today.  We have more bad tribute songs to play.  How many more have we got, Rick?  About five or six?  About five or six.  We've got a clip of Jay Moore.  What's that about?  It's something I found on the web.  Okay.  Beyond the Glory.  Oh, we like the Beyond the Glory stuff.  We've got some Dice vs. Dice from the other day.  How about getting Earl pissed off a little bit there?  That was nice, right? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, will that help you?  We can use that.  Okay.  Okay, good.  Oh, wait.  Cycle Mark's back, too.  Oh, good.  Hey, I think you'll be able to finish that song after all, Rick.  Cycle Mark's back.  Yeah, really.  After this?  To Rod.  Don't change the dial.  It's going to get very interesting.  Opie and Anthony.  Bunch of perverted crackers.  Right?  Oh, what?  It's hard to listen to us trying to talk teen girls into doing stuff with each other?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, hi, Anthony.

[00:21:00]  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  So, some 41 fat lip.  That's an happy song.  That song's an happy song.  Psycho Mark checking in.  Mac, a lot of people confused.  Every time we have Psycho Mark on now, people write us emails and stuff and say,  Why do you have Psycho Mark on the show?  I thought you were pissed at him for suing you. 
[00:21:30]  Psycho Mark didn't sue us.  He used to work for us about a year ago.  We got fired for having a couple have anal on the boss's couch during one of our Sex for Sam contests.  And he got fired.  We didn't want him to be fired.  They fired him.  His voice was still being used on this station.  So, he retained a lawyer and got money he felt he was due for the station playing his voice.  Had nothing to do with our show.  We were a little taken aback when he first did it. 
[00:22:00]  But, on the other hand, how the hell are you going to keep a nut like this off a show?  We love the guy.  It's a credit to his talents as an effing lunatic.  And someday he will be back full time with us.  Absolutely.  We just got to figure it out.  But, he helped us out with Operation Infinite Beer last night.  Yes.  As we went off the air, we weren't sure if the kegs were going to make it to ground zero.  And shortly after we went off the air, mission accomplished, right?  Mm-hmm.  But, Earl and Psycho Mark still just going at it for whatever reason.  Earl just bashed Psycho Mark. 
[00:22:30]  For some reason, Earl really, you call him an a-hole and stuff.  I don't understand what the problem is between you.  Maybe we can fix this.  Psycho Mark.  Yes.  Mark.  Hi, guys.  I'm calling from Champs Deli right down here at Wall Street.  Earl, you got a real problem with me or something?  Are you really being that un-American that you've got to bash me on the air?  It has nothing to do with being American or un-American.  It's just like...  Please.  Don't start, Earl, all right?  You did the most un-American thing last night by bailing out and pussying out and going back with the beer.  You're a complete un-American African-American. 
[00:23:00]  How about giving some sense of direction, a point person, some clarity on what is going on?  What?  Well, you're talking nonsense, Earl.  It's senseless babble out of your mouth.  Senseless.  You're just the most un-American person in my world.  Rehab.  Hello?  He just said rehab.  He goes two words, Mark.  Rehab.  Rehab.  I got a job, you dumb bastard.  I'm working.  Who needs a freaking rehab?  You need a mental... 
[00:23:30]  You need a therapist, Earl.  Are you calling me mental?  Oh, who's the one punching the dashboard when he couldn't get a class?  I'm a star, even though I'm not.  What?  I just work a camera for Fox.  Yeah, well, so what?  I'm making more money than you, you dumb bastard.  You've been there for ten years, and you still got the same damn job.  Yeah, but at least I know my worth, and I know my place.  I don't pretend to be something that I'm not.  Your ass stinks just like everybody else's, Mark.  That's why I have a job. 
[00:24:00]  That's why I've been moving up and working, huh, Earl?  You've done for yourself a lot of ten years.  Oh, you went from getting coffee at Fox to working a camera for Fox.  Yeah, well, at least I wasn't looking a bag of Scott Beauty's hair bag for ten years.  Whatever, Earl.  Look, all you did yesterday was the most un-American thing.  You gave up.  Yeah, I'm un-American.  Yeah, you did.  You did.  You gave up, and you went back.  You pounded the dashboard because you couldn't, and you didn't try a second time.  Whiskey-soaked, gin-soaked, cocaine-filled brain.  What? 
[00:24:30]  Cocaine, marijuana, cocaine, hash, everything.  Put it in my eyeball.  I don't care.  I'll do my job ten times better than you.  You F.  Mark, you sound a little upset.  I'm a little upset?  You're damn right I'm upset.  My neighbor was destroyed.  And you didn't help one bit.  You whipped out when the call came.  I did not whip out when the call came.  You absolutely did.  You couldn't get through.  You gave it one shot, and you gave it to your old drive.  We were turned at by friends of yours, law enforcement officials.  Yeah, you're a boss.  Because you go up to a law enforcement official, and you piss them off before you even get there 
[00:25:00]  by driving the van up at 100 miles an hour.  I've seen the way you drive, Earl.  You drive like a mental case, and they probably saw you coming and thought it was a block.  I drive like a mental case?  Nobody wanted to ride with you when you drove the van.  No kidding, because you're a city boy.  You shouldn't be driving.  Whatever, Earl.  I'm just very disappointed that you gave up so quick.  You gave up in, like, the weakest of the weakest.  I'm famous.  And I was like, who the F are you?  Who the F am I?  I'm just saying. 
[00:25:30]  You gave up, Earl.  You didn't give it a shot.  I'm a state trooper saying, I'm like, well, Mark Walsh.  And you walked away, and you went back down the other way, and you didn't give it a second shot.  I'm famous, even though I'm not.  Oh, listen to you.  Is that all you can say, Earl?  Just copy me.  Well.  Guys, tie a rope around his neck and push him out the window for a fratner aside, and not stand up.  Have another drink, Mark.  I ain't going to have a goddamn drink.  I'm going to hunk the bottle at your head.  Mark, we have your brother on the phone. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, boy.  That's just what you need.  Another alcoholic.  He wants to talk to Earl.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim.  How's it going, guys?  All right.  Hey, Earl.  I've got to just say one thing.  The last time I was in New York City, you were going to a wow sticker giveaway, and you got arrested or something.  They pulled you out of the car.  They fished you.  You couldn't even get to that thing.  Now, you see my rose of crack and all that stuff, but yet he got the beer down there, too.  You can imitate him and all, whatever you want to do, but he still got the beer down to the police guys. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, because he had proper credentials.  That was my whole point of this whole thing yesterday.  You're talking about being a father in order to reorder.  He walked up, and he had the balls to go up to the guy and say, he witnessed it.  He had credentials, Tim.  He had credentials.  He had proper credentials.  What do you have, Earl?  You don't have any credentials at all?  I thought you worked at the radio station.  You don't have any credentials at all?  You don't have any press passes.  That is a federal disaster area.  There are certain credentials that you need to bring stuff to.  You don't have press passes, though.  We said.  Earl, you don't have press passes. 
[00:27:00]  You don't have press passes.  Not proper ones?  No.  You don't have press passes because you can get any press passes.  I don't know if there's proper, improper ones.  The one that I have is for a non-emergency.  This is obviously an emergency.  The same press passes that I've been using the entire time, Earl, has gotten me past the line a thousand times.  You don't be happy.  You work for a TV network.  Of course you're going to do that.  You should cut your balls off now, Earl, because you don't have any, okay?  If they're there, then I'd be a mystery balls because I don't know where they are.  You've got none.  Kill yourself now.  Get in a coffin and die. 
[00:27:30]  I'm not going to win against two walls.  Earl, you should start drinking right now.  Do yourself a favor.  Go get a hooker and get laid, you stupid virgin.  At least I don't bang no listeners, you...  Earl, calm down.  Earl, calm down.  Earl, you're just a wimp and you just can't face reality.  That's all there is.  I'll show you how much I'm a wimp.  You're un-American and you're a scum guy.  Just stay away from me, Mark.  Okay, all right, fine.  That's fine, Earl.  I'll stay away from you. 
[00:28:00]  You know why?  Because I'm down here.  I'm down here.  I'll help her out.  Just stay away from me, Mark, because I guarantee you someone will get injured and it won't be me.  Come on down.  I'll push you under the...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Earl, why did that comment bother you?  The hooker comment?  No, the hooker comment...  I'm just...  I'm trying not to get angry.  That's all.  Oh, yeah?  No.  Don't forget, I'm a little bit bigger than my brother is.  All right, guys.  Guys, thank you very much.  All right.  Enough said.  Mission accomplished.  All right, Mark and Tim.  Tim and Mark.  God bless.  See you guys.  All right, bye. 
[00:28:30]  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Thank you, Earl.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Are you all right, Earl?  No, I'm not all right.  What's wrong now?  What do you want to make you better?  You all right?  Did you have fun last night?  Yes, I had fun last night. 
[00:29:00]  All right, Earl.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, Earl.  Just get some work out, that's all.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Jim from Jersey writes on the instant feedback, Anthony.  Yes.  I heard about this, and I wish I saw this on TV.  I was at the Flyers-Rangers preseason game at Philly last night.  They put the speech on during the second intermission.  Yeah.  For the president.  And went to turn it off at the start of the third period.  Yeah.  But the fans went crazy and were chanting, turn it on, turn it on, turn it on.  The Flyers organization turned it on, and 19,000 people watched the speech cheering and 
[00:29:30]  chanting USA.  After the speech, both teams lined up for a handshake, and they called the game a 2-2 tie.  Yeah.  Nobody complained.  It was the most amazing sports incident I ever saw in my life.  Yeah, I heard about that.  I don't know.  You go to a hockey game.  You want to see some masks?  And then you want to, I don't know, like, then you want to watch the speech?  You could have stayed home, I mean.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  Well, they needed to hear it.  Glenn, what's going on? 
[00:30:00]  You were there?  No, but, yeah, I just wanted to make sure you guys heard about that.  If the Philly fans don't want to see sports and they want to see the president, you know  the...  That this is pretty serious.  Yeah.  The Philly fans don't mess around.  Instead of seeing a Flyer-Ranger game, wow.  If that doesn't prove how serious it is.  Yeah, especially with Lindros on your team now.  Yeah.  Well, I'm an Islander fan, so I have my own hell.  Sorry to hear that.  All right, Glenn.  Thank you.  No problem.  Late.  All right, bye. 
[00:30:30]  Earl?  Oh, man.  All right.  We're trying to move on from the Earl thing, but...  Jerome, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say that I think it's kind of, you know, Earl's problem.  He's been having a bit of issues lately.  Issues?  Yeah, with the whole keg thing last night.  Yeah.  And he couldn't even mention to you guys that something was going on in the building.  Kind of, you know, someone needs to go through therapy for that.  Yeah, Earl, you want to talk to someone?  No, I'm fine. 
[00:31:00]  You sure?  I just have low tolerance for stupidity.  It almost sounds like he's trying to cry, but not really, you know?  I think you shirk your responsibilities sometimes.  No, I don't just shirk any responsibilities.  Well, you're the fire marshal warden guy off of the floor, and we had firemen come into  the building today, and you just left everyone to burn.  I didn't leave everyone to burn.  Yes, you did.  You were out on the sidewalk.  We're in the office wondering what's going on outside.  You were looking...  Never mind.  Then we looked out the window, you're right, when we heard all the commotion, wondering  what was going on.  And noticed everyone looking up where we were. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  And then, you know, you could say what, all the hows and whys about it, but, you know,  you didn't get that beer down there yesterday.  You know?  You went twice.  I think there were bigger issues going down there than whether or not beer was getting there.  The mission failed, and you were in charge of it.  We replaced you with Psycho Mark, and it got done immediately.  Well, let's...  The listeners want to try to calm you down.  All right.  Doug, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Who was the brain genius that made Earl the fire marshal?  Yeah, Earl, who made you...  Who made you the assistant? 
[00:32:00]  I didn't...  The assistant fire warden.  I had nothing in that decision.  I think it was based on senior...  Hey, Earl, what grade did they teach you to become incompetent?  Back in third or fourth?  Oh, you look good, Doug.  What?  Yeah, you say, I'm Doug from Springfield.  Guess what?  No one cares.  Oh, really?  Like, everybody cares about you?  You think you're a tough guy, right?  You hang up on me because I want to call through.  That's the only strength you have.  You call every show.  Hey, I think I'm a big fan of the show.  Goodbye.  He's a big fan of the station.  What are you hanging up for, Earl?  Earl, why?  I didn't hang up on you, Doug.  No, no, Earl.  Why are you running away for, Earl? 
[00:32:30]  Because I don't deal with losers.  Well, talk a little louder.  Get a job, Doug.  Take the sausage out of your mouth.  I'll buy you a nice gal, Earl.  Yeah, get a job, Doug.  All right.  I do have a job.  All right.  And I do a lot better than you do your job.  I'll guarantee you, I'll come in on a Monday, and I'll do anything you could do better,  which is nothing anyway, so.  Come on.  Challenge is on.  All right.  I'll come in Monday, and I guarantee you, I'll do your job blindfolded better than you do it.  Bring it on.  Not that you do anything.  I'll do a chart at Laverne and Shirley in anything you do. 
[00:33:00]  You do nothing.  You got nothing.  Remember what happened to them when they thought they could do a radio show?  That's what you do?  No.  I didn't say I did.  What do you do, sir?  I'm just pointing out an example, Doug.  Sir, what do you do, sir?  I'm in the promotions department.  Promoting what?  Nothing?  I'm a service director.  That's an easy job, promoting nothing.  Well, you lick a few envelopes.  It's the only thing you do lick, bud.  Well, first of all, the interns do the wild mail.  See?  Knowing nothing about the radio station, thinking that you...  Why do you hate me, Earl?  How come you hate me?  I don't hate you.  I just dislike you.  There's a difference.  You're in your voice. 
[00:33:30]  There was a big difference.  I just hate these Monday morning quarterbacks thinking that they know everything.  Who's talking about football?  What are you, crazy?  Where are we talking about football now?  It's a figure of speech, you...  Ass.  You want to be a football player now?  It's a figure of speech.  What about the figure of speech?  If you use that mask between your ears called your brain every once in a while, you would  know what that means.  Why do I want to be a quarterback?  I didn't mention anything about playing football.  I did play football, though.  You're just stupid, Doug.  Just admit that you're stupid.  Just say it.  I'm an idiot, and I'm stupid.  Good lineman. 
[00:34:00]  You don't know what...  You're just stupid, Doug.  I'm not a virgin, though, like you.  Say that to you.  Again, something you know nothing about.  He doesn't hit a nerve.  Because it's not true.  What's not true?  You're obviously not doing anything.  You're going to go to the radio station all day.  Why do you want to be a Monday morning cornerback?  It's a figure of speech.  Football's played mostly on Sundays.  What are you talking about, Earl?  You know what you're talking about, Doug?  Ron and Fez are on in two and a half hours.  You can call them then.  Well, so what about Ron and Fez?  All right, Doug.  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Okay, bye.  There you go.  Doug from Springfield.  Doug from Springfield.  Helps out our show.  We like Doug, girl.  Hey, Rhett.  You're assistant to the assistant fire ward.  Hey, Chris, you're next on the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How are you guys doing today, right?  Yeah, Earl looks like he's going to lose his mind any second.  Hey, Earl, let me ask you a question real quick, all right?  You can't hang pictures.  You can't deliver beer. 
[00:35:00]  And you can't get people out of a supposed to burning building.  Don't you understand why you work there?  Have you figured out yet why you work there, what your position is?  Why don't you take a hit from...  You know what you're talking about?  You have an absolute no...  You don't have no clue.  Hey, Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, why don't you take a hit from South Park and change your name to Tolkien?  Oh, Earl.  I have no...  I don't watch the shows.  I don't know what to do.  Oh, Earl.  You should get a hit from the guys.  You'll get it all figured out from then. 
[00:35:30]  All right, leave Earl alone.  We like Earl.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Why is everyone calling up Earl and bitching him out?  Oh, I love Earl.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me explain something.  I can't deliver...  We're trying to...  First of all, people are dying.  People are dead.  They're digging up dead.  They're trying to get in food, supplies, and other things.  They don't give a rat's ass about beer.  I didn't have any credentials to be down there.  We had no business being down there.  You don't have any... 
[00:36:00]  We're just trying to prioritize things a little bit.  Earl, how do you get into other promotions?  We had no point person.  We had no...  We didn't even know where we were going.  Earl, you got to checkpoints, Earl.  And then the person who put this together gave us no clue on where to go.  Earl, you got up to checkpoints.  How do you get into other promotions?  You have a press pass, aren't you?  Aren't you talking to the press pass and say,  I'm a black girl from the L.P. and Anthony show?  And they didn't give a rat's ass about it.  Federal agents did not give a rat's ass about a show based in New York. 
[00:36:30]  You don't get it.  It's a federal disaster area.  This is a...  I give up.  All right.  Ben, who's homesick today.  Oh, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  How you feeling?  A little bit better.  Are you feeling better?  A little bit better.  Ben's lips turned blue in the office, so he sent him home.  Ben, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, before the show, starts shivering in the office.  He's got goosebumps.  His hair is standing up.  His lips are blue.  And he's, like, sitting in his chair shaking. 
[00:37:00]  He looked like Robert Downey Jr. from Less Than Zero.  Right.  And...  Don't joke.  I mean, I'm not even joking.  Goosebumps, hair on his arm, standing straight up, blue lips.  Blue lips.  And he's, like, shivering.  And it was warm in the office.  Even a sick Ben wants in on this one.  Ben?  Yeah, I have to say that out of the whole radio station, out of everyone there, I'm probably  better friends with Earl and Mark than anyone.  And when I tell you I've talked to both of these guys separately about this, I really think  we're going to have a problem.  They both want to, like, beat the crap out of each other. 
[00:37:30]  Mark is completely pissed.  Earl's completely pissed.  I really think we're going to have to keep them separated.  I've never seen, especially Earl, ever like this.  And I've pissed Earl off many times.  But never, like, I've seen him the last 24 hours.  Yeah, Earl.  Did you break anything in the last 12 hours?  Yeah.  Didn't he yell at Ben yesterday?  Like, he said, get away!  Yeah, I asked Earl to come to the party last night.  I said, you know, Earl, you've got to move on. 
[00:38:00]  And he screamed at me and said, get away.  And, you know, he was angry.  And then Steve and Stinky tried to get him to go.  And then finally, when I got to the party, Open Jeremy told me to call him.  And we called him.  And he said he wasn't coming.  He had work to do.  And I said, you know, everyone wants you here.  And, you know, he finally showed up.  But he's...  I've never seen Earl like this.  And I've known Earl a long time.  More than anyone there, so...  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  See you later.  All right.  Bye.  All right, we've got to move on, Earl. 
[00:38:30]  You're going to be all right?  I'm fine.  One more, you're saying?  Andrew?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, how can a guy with no motion be in promotions?  I've heard your Sunday night show.  You have nothing to crow about.  Yeah, what's your profession?  Don't worry about what my profession is.  I'm asking.  What do you do for a living?  I drive a truck.  Exactly.  All right.  Next call, please.  I make a lot more money than you, Earl.  Yeah.  Lucas Luz.  No.  No one is going to beat that line today. 
[00:39:00]  We might as well go home now.  The line of the day.  How could you be in promotion if you have no motion?  Okay.  Next road show when everyone's asking me for a shirt.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Have a good weekend, guys.  All right, Andrew.  Take care.  Bravo.  That's too funny.  Hey, Chuck, you're next on the O&A show.  What's up?  Chuck.  Speak.  Chuck?  All right.  We lost Chuck.  Joe?  All right.  Dopey ass.  What?  You there?  You there?  Hi, it's Joe. 
[00:39:30]  All right, Joe.  What's up?  Hey, I've got a new name for him.  How about affirmative action, Earl?  Affirmative action, Earl?  Earl, comment?  Earl's been here for many years.  We like Earl.  Earl, don't lose it, man.  Earl, take a deep breath.  He always seems to...  We like Earl.  Earl's like the cockroach.  Doesn't matter how many nuclear blasts happen in here and cleans the place out.  Earl's still stays here. 
[00:40:00]  He remains.  Lives on.  You all right, Earl?  I'm fine.  Take a deep breath.  We don't want you losing it today.  Why does Keith the Cop want in on the Earl thing?  We really have to move on.  I don't want to see Earl lose it today.  Keith?  Keith?  I cannot think of one cop that if you pulled up with a van full of beer, that would have  said, no, you can't get in.  He just probably pulled up just like Earl always does.  He probably says, oh, hi, how you doing, I'm with N.E.W., and the guy says, no. 
[00:40:30]  Keith, may I interrupt for a minute?  Go ahead.  First of all, I was not driving.  Second of all, we fully explained our purpose there.  Uh-huh.  You weren't driving.  You were probably sleeping like you do at every sticker stop.  If I pulled up in a police car and I saw you at a sticker stop, you were sleeping.  We fully explained our purpose for being there, and it fell on deaf ears with every single...  You've got to work it.  Psycho Mark works it.  He worked it, and he got it done.  Every single cop we pulled up on, they said, no way are you getting into this area. 
[00:41:00]  You got to work.  We worked it.  What am I going to say?  We worked it.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, Keith.  Yeah, I'm losing you guys.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  There you go.  Let's keep the cop.  No, we got to move on.  Yeah.  We spent way too much time on Operation Infinite Beer.  All I know is the beer made it, okay?  It was a success.  Sorry to say, but no thanks to Earl.  Right there, Earl.  You all right?  I'm fine.  All right.  No, man.  I'm pretty effing fombs.  I'm okay. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  We got to take a break.  All right.  We really do.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel out your sister, feel out your  sister, feel out your sister.  Opie and Anthony.  You guys are awesome.  It's like I got a lift.

[00:43:00]  This Station, 1027 WNEW, New York.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show in the New York area.  You can call us at 877-692-1027.  Hey, is that benefit, that star-studded benefit tonight?  Tonight, yeah.  And who's going to be...  I don't understand how, like, they said all these entertainers get together, but it's  people like George Clooney and stuff.  What are they going to do? 
[00:43:30]  Like, you know, singers, I know, can come out there and sing.  But what are they going to act?  What they're going to do is they're going to come out and make us all cry.  Is that what this is all about?  Oh, yeah.  It's from 9 to 11 on every channel.  Seems like every channel is going to cover it.  So you're not going to be able to get away from this for another night.  See, Andrew Dice Clay, I think he's a little pissed at us because...  They took my idea.  He called us and he wanted to do the radio thong.  I have an idea. 
[00:44:00]  We get all the stations together and we have a radio thong.  We love the guy, but he's insane.  Because we're trying to tell him, Dice, they're doing this already.  No, no, no.  We do different.  They're doing the telethong.  Telethong.  And then it's going to be on pretty much every radio station in America.  So that's pretty much your idea already in the works.  All the networks, HBO Showtime, MTV, VH1, and a bunch of radio stations. 
[00:44:30]  So then after that, after this star-studded event with the creme de la creme of Hollywood,  then Dice will put his together.  That seems a little silly now, doesn't it?  Yeah, we're going to have to get Dice on the phone today.  They took my idea.  Well, I got some Dice clips.  Do we?  Yeah, the serious Dice trying to get us all pumped to do this radio thong.  Yeah.  And Anthony and I are sitting here and thinking in the back of our head,  wait, this is already happening. 
[00:45:00]  It's already in the works.  Yeah, what is he doing?  But before we get to that, stockbroker Dave is calling.  Come on.  All right, there you go.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, boys.  What exactly has been going on down on Wall Street?  What's the feeling?  And do you see any end to the bottom here?  Does Sticky need an assistant?  Yeah, that bad, huh?  Well, there was a late rally, though.  I got CNN on, and I saw it going from 200 to down only 140. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, we tested 8,000.  I think it's 8,075.  Dave, 9.30 this morning.  I turned on the TV, and it just dropped, what, 200 right off the bat today, right?  It was down 400.  Yeah, but right away it was 200.  Right away.  Oh, my God.  Well, the futures were down 36.  We came in knowing they were going to be down 200.  They stopped for a second, and then they got slammed again.  Basically, everyone thinks it's going to be World War III.  And until they're sure of that, we're not going to turn around. 
[00:46:00]  I mean, just today, they tried to rally them.  We were up 50 bucks at one point.  Everybody gave a loud cheer.  But then they slammed them again, and they finished.  Where the hell did they finish?  Down 140.  Tell me, what's the volume?  NASDAQ down 47.  2.3 again is the volume.  So it's massive volume.  But you're getting stocks here that are just 50% from what they were a couple of weeks ago.  Yeah, Dave, that's what I'm talking about. 
[00:46:30]  If you're in this for the long term, there are all the, I guess, the stocks that have been around for many years.  You know, that I would think would be a great buy.  And I can't agree with you more, but the bottom line is nobody has ever seen anything like this.  Right, right.  You sit there and say, what you're saying is common sense and logic and guaranteed you're going to make a lot of money.  But right now, if anybody has an opinion, you know, it's a big deal. 
[00:47:00]  There are stocks that are way undervalued right now for what they're doing.  I just can't agree with you more.  I mean, give me a stock.  If you take, all right, GE.  Okay, GE is getting the S kicked out of it.  GE closed.  Let me see what it did today.  Closed at $31.  Oh, my God.  How about Dell computers?  Dell's over the counter.  I can't get that.  Hewlett Packard. 
[00:47:30]  Hewlett Packard, $14.  Oh, my God.  Micron.  $21.  I mean, these stocks two weeks ago were twice as much.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  And I can't see these not coming back eventually just based on the fact that they're worth more than they're showing here.  It's not like, you know, the dot coms where they weren't worth what they were selling for.  And that's why those took a dump. 
[00:48:00]  These are worth.  And reason is out the window right now.  I know.  It's out the window.  But it seems to me it is a great buying opportunity.  A year from now, you're going to say, yes, I had the opportunity to buy Micron at $21.  The opportunity to buy GE.  Exactly.  I mean, GE is the greatest company in the world.  Right.  If you don't buy it now, when will you buy it?  And the thing is, if GE, if we get to the point in this country where GE never recovers, we're screwed.  Exactly.  Because it means we are done as a country, pretty much. 
[00:48:30]  Exactly.  So, I mean, it's a no-brainer.  Yeah.  Right now to get in on these discounted prices.  Dave, you seem kind of happy considering.  Yeah, you want to be happy.  See me at two hours after six bong hits, two martinis, as many volumes I can swallow.  So, anyone making money shortened this week?  I'm sure they did.  I mean, but the specialists down here, nine out of ten have lost money.  Yeah.  You know, if the firms are staying afloat, we'll deal with it. 
[00:49:00]  And that's the bottom line.  But you got, I mean, Goldman Sachs.  It looks like a split, a reverse split.  I mean, it was, where is Goldman Sachs sitting at now?  So, you got the employees there.  It's $27.  Hey, there's a guy that wants in on this, Mark.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  All right.  No, I was just listening here to Stockbroker Dave regarding GE.  I just found it odd to talk to the, you know, the opportunity to come right out and tell  everyone what GE did today.  Yeah.  The stock was down below $29, and then it popped right back up $2 after $10.40 on their 
[00:49:30]  earnings and their guidance going forward.  GE is a major company, a big conglomerate, and they are going to benefit from this.  There might be short-term pressure like there is all across the board, but, I mean, that's  something you guys O&A should look at.  So, I think that's why I said GE when Dave asked me about a stock.  That seems to be a no-brainer to get back into.  Absolutely.  And it's the greatest company in the entire world.  Hey, hey, Infinity Broadcasting. 
[00:50:00]  Just buy it and don't look back.  Don't look back.  Don't look back.  And you can start to take a look at Disney when things settle down.  The Bass Brothers got a margin call yesterday.  They had to sell, how many millions of shares yesterday?  The Bass Brothers.  Disney dumped a bunch, man.  They dumped a bunch.  I mean, if you're the Bass Brothers and you're getting a margin call, everyone else is there.  But that, you know, but that, again, is another, Disney's another company that, I mean, where  are they going?  Are they, is Disney going to fold? 
[00:50:30]  No.  Disney's closed at $17.87.  $17 frickin' dollars.  I remember when they were bitching when it went down in the 30s.  $17 for Disney.  Oh, man.  Guys, I just want to say something to the cops and firemen.  We've had probably a couple hundred come to the floor.  And every time they come in, they walk in through 11 walls.  They get a standing ovation.  And as they walk through the entire floor, I mean, the whole New York Stock Exchange is  applauding and shaking hands with these guys. 
[00:51:00]  It's weird what's going on in the city.  You weren't listening earlier, but we had a fire scare in our building today, Dave.  Oh, man.  And everything turned out okay.  But there was over 1,000 people outside the building.  They evacuated the whole place.  And the firemen are walking out.  And one by one, the whole crowd is just applauding.  Yeah.  Isn't it awesome?  And everyone is, like, crying outside and stuff as these guys come out of our building  one by one.  Yeah.  I just want to say, if any cops or firefighters are listening right now, if you come to the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange, please look me up.  And I'll give you a guided tour. 
[00:51:30]  I took open, Anthony.  They'll tell you.  I'll give you the royal treatment.  Because you guys are heroes.  And you get treated like heroes when you come down here.  A lot of them are ringing the poles and bells.  We would love to come back ourselves.  Come on, boys.  You know, you've got an open invitation.  The guys down here could use it.  We'll wait for you guys to rally a little bit.  But my heart goes out to those guys.  And guys, please look me up when you come down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  All right.  Cool, Dave.  Have a great weekend, brothers.  And thanks for keeping everybody going.  Thanks, Dave.  Hang in there, right?  All right, boys.  Be well.  Monday's another day.  Love you, boys.  All right.

What stock is that?  Exodus Communications.  Ah. 
[00:55:00]  Exodus, huh?  Exodus.  Make your own joke.  Wow.  That's telling.  Oh, man.  Exodus Communications, people.  36 cents.  I just bought a cup of coffee with what's left over.  I'm going to get 100 shares at least.  Is that an Afghanistan communication company?  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  Buy Afghani's dicks.  Let's go to Stockbroker.  His cash just made an extra this, Peaks.  Let's go to Stockbroker, Tony.  Tony. 
[00:55:30]  Guys, stop the madness, please.  After four o'clock, I can't listen to this anymore.  Talk about vaginas.  Wowing.  Boo.  Then the gynecologists call up and get mad.  Look at you.  Yeah, I know.  This guy's been working all day.  He tunes us in when he gets out.  We're talking about stocks.  We're talking about stock, people.  He's trying to forget about this guy.  I call out of my office, and I'm like, I can't wait to put O&A on.  I've got to go now and fire a $2 million client.  I just can't stand listening to them anymore.  I'm on my way to the house.  All right, Tony.  Hang in there. 
[00:56:00]  Have a great weekend, all right?  Husbands, please.  Something.  All right, we'll do something.  Yeah.  We want to play the dice club, actually.  Yeah.  Dice came up with this idea, the radio thong.  Excuse me.  He called the show the other day, and got a clip of Dice being really serious, trying  to rally the troops, and we're trying to tell him, Dice, the idea's already out there.  They're doing it tonight.  They're doing the telethon.  It's going to be on all the radio stations.  Telethon.  But he didn't want to hear that stuff.  So Dice was getting really serious, and we decided to help him out with some music behind 
[00:56:30]  him, and then he couldn't take it.  Yeah.  So check this out from the other day.  The greatest country in the world, and even though this thing happened in New York and  in Washington, we are all connected, and that's what makes us the United States.  And this thing that happened, in my opinion, in the greatest city and the greatest country  in the world, you know, has to be taken care of.  You know, and I don't like when I hear people saying, you know, we were a great country.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:57:00]  We were, we are, and always will be the greatest country ever.  That's bravo.  And, you know, I just want to say this, and then we can talk about whatever you want,  because, you know, I mean, you know what happened is awful, and I knew that the day  or two after, there wouldn't be that many people listening.  Right.  You know, I mean, but you know what, I, you know, I am from that city, you know that.  I'm from, I'm from Brooklyn, and, and stop playing the music. 
[00:57:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  If you, you gotta stop playing the music, really, I'm gonna get mad.  I think it's a nice background.  You know, well, I'm having a hard time thinking when you do this.  Nice, it's the national anthem.  Yeah, we're feeling it right now.  No, I'm just trying to say something to you.  This is the one time I'm calling in, you know, serious, and you're jerking me around here.  No, well, you know, I liked what you were saying, so we figured a nice background music for it.  All right, well, shut it off. 
[00:58:00]  Anthony.  Yeah.  Anthony with the buttons.  I don't have a button.  I'm not playing this.  What do you want?  What do you, what do I gotta give you, jokes?  No.  I'm not gonna go into that now.  I liked what you were saying.  Continue talking about the filthy animals.  All right, why can't they teach driver's ed and sex ed in that third world country?  It's too hard on the camel.  I mean, what kind of jokes?  There you go.  What do you call a, what do you call a chink and a jap driving around in a Trans Am?  The gooks that has it. 
[00:58:30]  You know what I mean?  What do you want?  What's better than ten fingers on a piano?  Two lips around my organ.  We're not doing jokes today.  You know what I mean?  Oh, I like that.  No, I'm just trying to talk about this thing.  Hey, I'm hanging up.  No, don't.  I'm hanging up.  I want to talk about this telephone.  Don't hang up.  All right.  Now, you're gonna be right.  You know, you think it's a big joke.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, but you got all these kids out there. 
[00:59:00]  I'm not talking.  I'm hanging up.  No, Dice, don't hang up.  I'm hanging up.  You're getting me mad.  It's almost over.  You can't cut it off in the middle.  It's the National Anthem.  So it's almost done.  Listen to this note.  This is from the Chicago Yankee game last night where Mrs. Butterworth got up and sang  that great version of the National Anthem.  There we go.  All right, Dice.  You know something?  You guys are morons no matter what.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.

And then you click on, uh, Movie Clips, and I just watched these people, uh, sawing somebody's  head off.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Great, uh, great video of, of the way they treat, uh, people over there.  That government.  That, that disgusting government over there in Afghanistan that will soon have a, a rain 
[01:04:00]  of bombs on them.  Not soon enough, though.  Hey, we gotta go to the High Line, man.  This is pretty cool.  Hey, Mike.  Yeah.  Hey.  Opie and Anthony, man.  What's up, man?  The guitarist from Stain checking in.  That would be me.  How are you, my friend?  I'm doing well.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  We've been better.  Yeah, I hear ya.  You know?  I do.  Where are you right now?  I'm home, actually.  Springfield area?  Springfield area.  Nice.  Exactly.  We miss Springfield. 
[01:04:30]  Come on, do ya?  Yeah, we did some things in Springfield.  I remember, I remember you guys.  Oh, yeah.  You remember us from our Boston days?  I do remember you from your Boston days.  I was a working scrub back then.  What were you doing back then?  I was, uh, actually, I was a HVAC engineer.  Come on, get out of here.  I wouldn't lie to ya.  That's exactly what I did before I got into radio.  Shut up.  I was a tin knocker, man.  Oh, really?  Hell yeah.  Right on.  I'd, uh, install everything. 
[01:05:00]  The units, the ductwork.  Give it to me, I'll install it.  How many, how many, uh, stitches you get from, uh, cutting yourself on, on sheet metal?  No, that wasn't my deal.  I would actually do the, uh, digital control system.  Oh, service guy.  No, I would actually, I mean, I had a degree in engineering.  I would design the stuff and sell it.  Oh, wow.  That's a nice gig.  I was out there in the trenches, you bastard.  Yeah, I did that too, though.  I mean, I worked for a real small company.  So I would, I would bid the job, get the job, design it, install it, service it. 
[01:05:30]  We did that too, but it was called a side job that our bosses didn't know about.  Right, there you go.  And they also didn't know they were sponsoring half the job, too.  You got their truck out there using all the tools and, uh.  What the hell, you know, if, uh.  Why not?  If some, uh, metal made it into the truck and made it to a side job.  Well, this sure as hell beats, beats being a tin knocker.  Oh, tell me about it.  How do you go from a tin knocker to one of the biggest bands out there now?  Yeah.  How does that happen?  Yeah, what was your break?  Everyone's heard of the luck I got into, but, uh. 
[01:06:00]  Uh, Fred Durst.  Come on.  Yeah, he discovered, pretty much discovered you guys.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Brought us to the right people and, uh, really gave us a shot.  And, uh, you know, we just kind of took it.  Yeah, but wait, wait, wait.  But you had to get to Fred Durst.  I mean, there's a million bands in the Springfield area.  Mike was, uh, doing, uh, the installation of Essential Air at Fred's house.  No, actually, we were, we were gigging around a lot in, in New England.  And, uh, uh, Limp Bizkit, this was like right after a $3 bill came out. 
[01:06:30]  I was doing a gig in Hartford and some friends of ours in a band in Connecticut called up  and, uh, in a band called Sugar Mill called up and said, hey, man, we got this gig.  You guys want to open for Limp Bizkit with us?  They were like, absolutely.  And, uh, so it was pretty much through that meeting that, you know, we hooked up with Fred.  And, you know, he gave us the opportunity, uh, to play, well, which we did that night.  And I liked what we did.  Mike, a little known fact, Anthony and I, uh, pretty much did the first interview with Fred Durst. 
[01:07:00]  Really?  Swear to you, man.  Yeah, when they were just kicking around.  They were just getting some, uh, some buzz with, uh, that song Counterfeit.  Counterfeit, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh.  It was about the same time that we played with them.  No kidding.  Yeah, exactly.  Anthony and I, uh, this will bring back memories for us.  We were doing this, uh, this radio thing in Framingham, and, and Fred showed up, uh, and  hung with us, uh, that afternoon when, when we let the turkeys loose, Anthony.  Yeah, I remember that.  And, and he was with us when we were pretty much getting attacked by our own listeners. 
[01:07:30]  By, uh, uh, uh, uh, they were throwing rocks, sticks, and ice balls at us because we scammed  our audience that day.  And then any good listener should do.  And he was, he was pretty cool, you know.  It was weird because then as time went on and he, uh, uh, uh, Biscuit just took off.  He was cute.  One of the biggest bands in the world, right?  He was like, God damn, man, why can't we get him now?  We almost had him recently, but, uh, some politics, uh, played into it, but, oops.  Got ya.  So, what's going on, Mike?  Nothing.  I'm just, just really glad to be home. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, we've been on the road since, like, February.  So, we did a tour in February with Godsmack, another Boston band.  Yeah.  And, uh, that was great.  Yeah.  We know them well.  Yeah, right on.  Of course.  Hey, I gotta tell you, the new Stained album is my favorite.  I'm cranking it every single day.  Seriously.  Thank you, man.  No joke.  Every day.  I mean, every song on that album is amazing.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  I think you got four or five more songs that can make the radio, no problem.  Right on.  Thank you very much.  We were all happy with it when we finished it. 
[01:08:30]  I mean, it was, uh, it was kind of questionable when we were making it, but when we finally got  it done, we all, you know, we all kind of sat down and looked at each other and went,  wow, man, this came out, this came out pretty good.  Why was it questionable doing it?  Oh, it wasn't.  It was just, uh, the thing was when we, when we went out to LA to record it, the songs were  really just kind of in this like, uh, baby stage and they really needed to grow and mature  and it was, they kind of went through this growth process in the studio as, as we were  recording them.  And, uh, uh, they just, you know, as things kept getting done and, and adding what we felt 
[01:09:00]  the songs needed, they just kind of, kind of took on a life of their own and, and turned  up into what they are now.  And, uh, it, but it was really, there was, there was a time there in the middle when we  were just like, all right, is this, you get too close to what you're doing sometimes.  Yeah.  And then you, you listen into it 18,000 times over and over and you go like, God, is this  great or does it suck?  You just start to question yourself and you, and you really lose sight of, of what you're 
[01:09:30]  doing sometimes.  You really need to step away from it and come back to it.  And, and there was a couple of times where we just took a couple of weeks and said,  you know, look, we're going to, we need some time.  We're going to come back to it.  And, and we did.  And, uh, when we finally finished it, I mean, I remember leaving Miami, we finished it right  before Christmas last year and coming home with a CD and, and listening to it on the  plane and going, wow, I, I think this is a really good record.  Do you think?  It's being played everywhere.  I mean, how does, how does that make you feel?  Some bands get, you know, they're not into that.  Others obviously are, but I mean, in the New York area, there's got to be, 
[01:10:00]  I don't know, 20 stations that are playing your stuff.  That's, that's crazy.  I mean, the thing is, you know, if people want to play it and people want to hear it,  that's cool.  I mean, I, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't weird that people say they hear us in between  like Britney Spears and NSYNC.  That is weird to me.  But I mean, you know, if, if people want to hear the songs and they appreciate it and  they can get something out of it, then listen to it, you know?  Yeah.  Hey, is it true Fred Durst thought you guys were Satan worshipers?  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  I kind of, I kind of jumped over that story because it's been told a million times.  Yeah.  The first time that we, we played for them, he, uh, he pretty much snapped on us because,  uh, we had, uh, independent CD.  We were pushing around New England and selling at gigs.  And there was some pretty, uh, graphic artwork on the cover.  Yeah.  It was a picture of a bloody cross and a Barbie doll.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  And he, uh, took a fence and threw across the bar.  You guys are whacked.  Tried to have us thrown off the bill.  And, uh, you put a greased naked woman on all fours wearing a dog collar. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  That's cool.  I'm down with that.  The Bible thing, forget about it.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  Well, how's this whole thing affecting, uh, the band as far as, uh, playing and whatnot?  Uh, you know, I mean, the shows, the shows have been great.  I mean, the crowds just seem to get better and better, which is, uh, I mean, man, we  were even touring on the last record, Dysfunction.  I mean, we were all, that had, you know, pretty much achieved what we wanted.  I mean, we're playing these, you know, a couple thousand theaters and the shows were 
[01:11:30]  always great.  And it's, it just seems to get better and better.  Were you done, were you done with the tour, uh, last Tuesday when this happened?  The, the terror attack?  We actually left New York about three days before it happened.  We were in, we were in New York for the video music awards.  Right.  And, uh, man, I could see the World Trade Center from my hotel window.  Yeah.  And, uh, I, I just, uh, I was, uh, I was exercising that morning and I heard something  on the radio and I didn't really know what they were talking about.  I turned on the TV, unfortunately, in time to see the second plane. 
[01:12:00]  And, uh, I, uh, I don't think I left the couch for a good three days just looking for information.  Information overload, man.  Yeah, totally.  I was an information whore.  I just wanted it.  And, uh, it was, uh, it's just incredible to me, man.  I, I can't, I can't believe that somebody has that much hate.  Yeah.  To do something like that.  Yeah.  You know, it's very, very hard to believe and, uh, really put us in a situation where 
[01:12:30]  we have no choice but to do what we're about to do.  Yeah, I, I agree, man.  We've got to make some kind of a statement.  Have to.  Yeah.  There's, there's, there's nothing else that can be done.  Some scary times for everybody.  It really is, man.  The thing is, there's just such an uncertainty in the future and, and what, what it holds  where, whereas before all this happened, you know, I mean, everybody was, you know, you  go to work, you do your job, you try to do the best you can and, you know, everything  seems, at least on the surface, okay.  And then you don't know that there's some psychopath out there plotting against you. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  And these poor people that, their biggest mistake was to get up and go to work that  day.  Right.  You know, and, and then the firefighters, the same thing.  I mean, they just tried to save these people and it's just such a waste.  Yeah.  Well, we hear that, you know.  Well, let's try to move on to some happier things.  The family, uh, I, I know there's no way to say into this, so.  No, there's nothing, but you guys are playing, you guys are playing the, uh, family value  tour this year. 
[01:13:30]  Yes.  Who else is on the bill?  Well, for the people that don't know, STP's headlining, it's STP, us, Lincoln Park, Static  X, and, uh, it's been Deadsy.  That's going to be great.  Yeah.  I'm, I'm really psyched, man.  It's, it's so cool to be able to go on tour with, with bands that you're actually a fan  of too, you know, and, uh, and look forward to going out and watching.  And we've been very, very fortunate to, to be on tour with a lot of bands like that.  And, uh, you know, just to be on the same stage with STP is, is awesome.  Those guys are amazing.  When is the family value tour hit in Boston? 
[01:14:00]  Um, the 27th.  20th.  Or is it in Worcester?  Where is it?  October, yeah, it's in Worcester, October 27th.  And tickets are going on sale, what, Saturday or something like that?  Yeah, this weekend.  I think tomorrow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Hey, this guy has a question for you.  Hold on.  Um, Anthony.  Yeah, what's up, man?  You're on with Mike from Stain.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Mike?  How you doing?  I don't have a question.  I just want to say, you know, like, I'm 22 years old now.  And, like, I think, if I look back on it, you know, if I was a kid, like, 15, 16, if  I had Stain then, you know, it would have, like, made things a little bit better, you 
[01:14:30]  know?  Like, I look back on the songs you guys have now, and I can just, like, feel better,  you know?  Thank you.  I hope they're helping you now, or, you know, again, something.  Well, yeah, I can look back on it, like, make sense of stuff, you know?  Like, especially, like, songs like For You and stuff.  Sure.  Sure.  Like, anybody, like, nobody has it, like, easy growing up.  I just think, like, Stain now is, like, kind of like Life of Agony then.  Right.  I just think it's, like, it's more direct now.  Like, Stain is, and you guys are just, like, like, specific instances.  It's just awesome, man. 
[01:15:00]  Thank you, man.  I'm glad you appreciate it.  Well, do show dressing.  Later, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Take it easy, Anthony.  All right, Mike.  Oh, Mike.  Well, hold on.  Let me get rid of him.  Okay.  There you go.  Well, Mike, thanks for calling the show.  We appreciate it.  No problem, man.  Hey, what's your favorite song on the album?  Don't give me a hit.  I'll play it.  I'll play any song you want from the CD.  Oh, boy.  For 14 Cities, my friend.  For 14 Cities.  Well, you know, actually, the new single, I mean, I'm not even just saying that. 
[01:15:30]  It's probably one of my favorite songs.  Fade.  Yeah.  I really like that one.  For you, the last track is really cool.  Take it.  I like Take It.  Well, you tell me which one to play.  I don't care.  Potty mouth there, Mike.  You got potty mouth.  You can't make it.  I'm a father.  I like them all.  So I can't.  I don't even really have a favorite one.  You can't make a decision, Mike.  I can't.  What can you do with the language we're not allowed to use on the air and have to jump  out?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I thought we were off the air. 
[01:16:00]  We're going to get along just fine with you, Mike.  Yeah, right on.  All right.  We'll help you guys out.  Well, like you need the help.  We'll play Fade.  Now, you know what?  Honestly, I really dig that tune.  Okay.  Yeah.  I really like that tune.  All right, man.  And I'm not just saying that because, you know, that's why the tune's out there, because  we like it.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I hear you.  Well, next time in New York, we'd love to have you on the show.  There's a lot of politics that go on with this radio crap, but we would love to see  you guys.  Isn't that ridiculous, though?  Totally. 
[01:16:30]  It's kind of silly, but we're working on it.  Mike, thank you so much.  Good talking to you guys, man.  All right.  And have fun with the Family Value Tour.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow for the Worcester date.  All right, Mike.  Yeah, good.  Take care, man.  Thanks.  Thanks, man.  Good to see you.  Mike from Stained.  And as we go to break, we'll play Fade for everyone, okay?  Cool.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine steak.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:17:00]  Theater of the Mindless.  Anthony, oh to go.  Oh to go.  Oh to go.  Oh to go.  This is the oxygenated distilled drinking water, right?  Yeah, distilled water.  Very healthy for you.  Somehow they get a lot of oxygen in the water and you don't lose space.  Right.  It's not just like, you know, they put half the bottle full of water and half full of oxygen.  No.  And the silly point, look, yeah, the oxygen's in the water.  Not much water, but lots of oxygen. 
[01:17:30]  It's in the water.  And it's distilled water, which is very healthy for you.  I didn't know there was oxygen in water.  But it tastes like just distilled water.  Doesn't taste very good.  But when you have oxygenated distilled water, it tastes great.  So refreshing.  And it gives you that needed oxygen, doesn't it?  Does it taste like water?  Yes.  Okay, that's all I need to know.  Like crisp, clean water.  Mmm.  But it's got more oxygen in it.  Oh to go. 
[01:18:00]  That's right.  Your coffee replacement will perk you up and taste great.  Oh to go.  Now, the station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York.  Hey, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  If you're not in New York, we've got a few phone lines open right now.  866-2774.  Wow. 
[01:18:30]  You know, I'm distracted.  I've got to go to Mark.  Why?  Because he's a friend of the show and I want to make sure this isn't true.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Did you hear about the WWF latest tragedy?  What?  Kurt Angle was paralyzed from the neck down.  Stop.  Who's telling you this?  What are you talking about?  I've seen it last night.  Did you guys watch SmackDown last night?  Wait, was that a joke, Mark?  No, it's the truth.  Yeah, if you go to any of the wrestling news websites, it's all over. 
[01:19:00]  Just go there.  Wouldn't it be on the news like it was when...  Well, he didn't die, man.  Come here.  Yeah, just go, all right?  Whatever, Mark.  People love their rumors.  Well, the guy's been on our show a bunch of times, so, you know.  He's lying.  We obviously can't confirm that.  I don't know what Mark's deal is.  WWF website.  There's nothing about it on there. 
[01:19:30]  Stop it.  All right.  Let's move on, then.  I just want to make sure that that wasn't the truth.  People in their goddamn rumors.  In the studio.  I'm so alive.  I'm so alive for the very first time forever in blue jeans.  You like P.O.D., huh?  Yeah, I guess he likes P.O.D.  Neil Diamond likes to pick ass.  Big P.O.D., yes.  I'm so alive for the very first time in America. 
[01:20:00]  America, they come into America today, alive.  Gary.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, more on in the day, I just called up about Angle.  Yeah.  That was taped, and if they would have kept running the show, Angle came back at the end  wearing a plastic fake neck brace, taunting Austin.  All right.  Thanks, Gary.  No problem.  Wow.  I appreciate that.  Phone's got the runs. 
[01:20:30]  I know, but we're, you know.  We're all friends with Kurt.  Right.  Paul Mercurio, one of our favorite guests in the studio.  He works with The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central, and, man, that was pretty  tough last night, watching Jon Stewart just kind of...  Did you believe the tie he was wearing?  Bang!  Oh, my God!  Are you insane?  The guy poured out all his emotion.  He has no emotion.  No.  Yeah, it was unbelievable.  It really was.  Yeah.  First of all, just you guys, awesome radio the last ten days. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, really?  That's my one moment of sincerity.  Now you're both queer.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You suck.  No, really awesome.  I thought you had the right tone and touch.  Because we've been struggling with it.  Yeah.  In a news format, we don't know what, you know...  None of us know what to do.  We're going to walk there with a couple of chimps for a half hour.  Exactly.  Watch them juggle.  Jon said something that was really good last night.  He said that we are...  Oh, how did he put it?  We're in the back seat of America.  Throwing spitballs.  Throwing spitballs and stuff.  I was like, you're so right.  In the back of the classroom.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Exactly.  But he said it was in the back of America or whatever.  Yeah, we're sitting in the back of America shooting, throwing spitballs at kids in a classroom.  Yeah, because we don't know how to be serious.  Ant and I know how to just be goofballs, you know?  And I didn't even get at that.  What?  Hey!  I love it.  Paul, how do you warn that crowd for a show like last night?  There we go.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, when Jon comes out, I want you to seem really somber.  He's just going to be sitting at his desk.  There's going to be no intro music.  When he starts tearing up, I really need you to be absolutely silent. 
[01:22:00]  This is how you do it.  You go, thanks for coming out to The Daily Show, everybody.  We're really happy you're here.  Just a couple things to get out of the way.  If you have any beepers or cell phones, you have to turn them off.  Not that it matters anyway, because death is inevitable.  Join the show.  Oh, God.  That brings it right down.  Yeah, that'll put everybody in that melancholy state.  You just basically say, Jon's going to come out and he's going to cry like a pussy for  ten minutes.  Oh, God.  No.  I told him how great it was.  Oh, my God.  I don't love my job anymore. 
[01:22:30]  The guy was very sincere, man.  He was so honest.  For anybody out there, the show was basically unscripted.  We did, if you saw it, we just, Jon did his thing up front and it was just amazing unscripted.  And his thing with Martin Luther King and like.  Yeah, that was.  I don't know why you're laughing.  Amazing.  No, I, I, because someone on the screen, I got to let him in, because I love our listeners.  They pick up on everything.  Paulie, go.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I want to talk to Tony Soprano.  I hear him on the radio.  I got to, I'm a big fan.  Oh, okay.  It says on the screen, yes, Tony Soprano's back. 
[01:23:00]  You mean it's just Paul McCuricrome?  Paul McCuricrome.  You don't talk to Tony Soprano's friend like that.  Man, that is.  Uncle Junior.  That is amazing.  Uncle Junior, how is the C?  How is the big C, Uncle Junior?  You know, I'm hanging in there, Tony.  I got the ass cancer, Tony.  Wow, the man is comic genius.  The moron bacala.  He wasn't able to get my appointment with Dr. Kennedy.  Uncle Junior.  I don't know what to do.  Uncle Junior, I got a roasted pepper and Capacol sandwich. 
[01:23:30]  Would you like some?  Put it in a blender and make it into something I could put in my ass cancer.  I got the ass cancer, Tony.  I need an enema.  Did you see Uncle Junior?  Did you see, I don't know if I'm doing me or Tony right now.  No, you're obviously doing Tony.  I can hear it.  It's dead on.  It's dead on.  So anyway, oh, John.  Yes.  So I thought it was amazing.  It was good.  Not because I worried.  It was like, what are you going to do? 
[01:24:00]  I don't know what you're doing.  I was waiting for Mo Rocker to pop in.  Hello.  John, stop crying.  What do you think of my suit?  Hello.  Hello.  How's that for a topper?  That's the ghost of Mrs. Muir.  Well, we spent it.  Lewis enjoyed that.  By the way, he may be calling in.  I told him I was coming on.  Really?  I don't know where he is in the country.  He's probably hiding under a desk, that pussy.  I'm sure.  Yeah, he's not coming out of hiding.  He's paranoid. 
[01:24:30]  We have no idea what he's going to do next week.  Normally, oh, my God.  Because it seems so trivial to be talking about water skiing squirrels right now.  Right, right.  Look at the squirrel.  He's water skiing.  People have better things to do with squirrels.  Yeah.  Well, it's like he's in the studio.  I know, at the lab.  That's the lab.  And, yeah, so we kind of just, it was like surfing the wave.  It was him.  It was we.  It's so presumptuous.  We didn't really do anything.  We sat around and read the paper for a couple of days. 
[01:25:00]  There's nothing to do.  There's nothing to do with it at all.  Yeah, how are you going to goof on that?  So now, the show will be, we're on again Monday, obviously, but it's going to be different.  We're not going to, we can't, you know, you can't go after Bush.  You can't go after, we're, not only do we parody the news, but the people who cover the news,  you can't really go after them because you're doing a pretty good job.  Soon.  Yeah.  Soon.  I think you can start chipping away at that.  I don't know.  CNN, if he takes any longer pauses, I'm going to fly down where he is and hit him in the face with a sledgehammer.  He's so, he's so melodramatic.  It's like, and that was the weather. 
[01:25:30]  Judy, and Judy's neck.  Jesus.  Can we get a fun together to fix her neck, Judy Woodruff?  It's like, it's like an alligator fell asleep on her neck.  It's long and wrinkly and ugly, ugly, bad.  She should wear high collars like Michael Douglas.  Notice Michael Douglas wears high collars?  Yeah.  By the way, his abortion brother, Eric Douglas, was at a comedy club last night.  Can we seriously, can we, can we do something about, can we send them over to the Afghans? 
[01:26:00]  Can we make them our point guys?  It's tough, right?  Being Michael Douglas' brother.  He didn't come with his little gay dog.  What a homo.  Is the Daily Show going to start utilizing that video phone technology that CNN has used?  The delay?  The delay is amazing.  The kind of where the question gets asked and then you can go in and make yourself a hero  and come out and get the answer.  You know, I feel so bad for the guy on the other end.  I know.  It's CNN.  It's Time Warner.  It's the biggest company in the world.  It has more money than God.  And the guy's hanging out there, Aaron Fletcher, whatever his name is, Rob Fletcher or something. 
[01:26:30]  How is the Taliban reacting to Bush's request to hand over Bin Laden?  Right.  And he's, but you can see him.  That's the greatest thing.  You can see him shaking his head.  Yes.  And right when he goes to talk, I would love the anchor guy to go.  And another question.  Because that will screw him up forever.  When they volley like a retarded ping pong match, the, no, you go, but, but, but, I got 
[01:27:00]  it.  Could you shut, could you, shut the, shut the, you stupid mother, and they're going back  and forth.  All right.  We'll be back with him and his stupid video phone.  Wait, can we get him another blue shirt?  The guy has one blue shirt.  One blue shirt.  Am I the only one in the country who's the same guy hasn't changed?  Yeah.  Where's he doing laundry, though?  Yeah.  He's in Afghanistan.  Well, he's doing laundry with the rest of the towel.  He's beating his, he's beating his, he's beating his blue shirt with a stick.  I was just watching CNN. 
[01:27:30]  They're beating effigies of America.  Well, they got those big sticks that look very menacing.  Exactly.  The very menacing stick is no match for a missile.  Here's a tip for you, you nutjobs, you Taliban-y nutjobs, you wacky kids.  When you're burning somebody in effigy, maybe you want to stay away from the long robe  clothing because it catches fire in the bottom.  It works its way up.  They're like running through the fire and then they realize, not a good idea.  Not a good idea.  Because I'm on fire.  Woo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo.  It was like a Three Stooges sketch. 
[01:28:00]  I tried to burn an effigy, and I burst into flames.  Damn you, damn you, Rayon.  Help me.  I curse you today, Rayon.  I said cotton.  The devil's from the West made Rayon.  Number 27 reason to take my wife's tentacles out.  Biatch.  Look how much I'm sweating.  What's wrong with me? 
[01:28:30]  You guys are too nice to mention it, but I am sweating like a pig.  It's uncomfortable.  What is wrong with you?  I walked over here.  I was behind.  I was later than I wanted to be, and I go to the side door, and it's closed.  There's three entrances to get into this building.  Very secure building now.  It's very secure.  There's a guy, your security guard's sleeping on a cot doing nitrous.  We had a fire scare today.  Barney Fife downstairs.  Now, Barney, take the bullet out of your pocket and put it in your gun.  Good job, Ange.  And so I had to sign in, and then I was running, and then I was upstairs. 
[01:29:00]  And then, you know when you tell yourself not to sweat?  Well, of course you sweat.  You sweat then.  Yeah.  I got nowhere to go with that.  Well, we got to get Frank Caliendo in on this.  Frankie.  Frank.  Hey, how are you guys?  What's up, buddy?  Not much.  Hey.  Check it in and see how you guys are doing.  Well, all right.  We've been better.  Tony Soprano's doing well.  Thank you.  Paul Mercurio in the studio, Frank.  Did you hear his dead-on impression of Tony Soprano?  Yeah, that was excellent.  Oh, my God.  It sounds just like him. 
[01:29:30]  Hey, Carmela, pass the juice.  Look at it.  I got goosebumps right then when you did that.  I got to get something to wipe my face.  I'll be right back.  How about a quilt?  What?  I don't know.  I don't know what you want.  What is wrong with you, man?  Hey, huh?  I got no respect.  I got to tell you.  I had a slow elevator, and I was jacking.  I gave myself a little light jack on the elevator.  What a light jack?  My God.  So, Frank.  You're like Whitney Houston in a sauna.  Wow, how skinny and sick.  I'm sorry. 
[01:30:00]  I'm sitting there.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into the Whitney Houston.  No, she can't.  And she can sweat.  So, Frank, what's going on with you?  Well, you know, in the midst of all this stuff, it's kind of a weird time.  We've got the premiere of Mad coming out this week.  Mad TV.  Mad TV.  Now, you're in the cast now.  Yeah.  This is my first episode.  Congratulations.  Thank you much.  And I'm in a little bit.  I do a little Pacino, and next week I'm in quite a bit more.  You need anybody to do a Tony Soprano?  They actually have a Sopranos thing in the, we have it, I guess, in the first episode. 
[01:30:30]  They're rerunning that, I don't know if you guys saw it last year, but they did the Sopranos  on PAX.  Oh, no.  That's a great idea.  And it's just all like the bleep outs and everything like that.  And, you know, the funny thing is, it's kind of the same joke for the whole sketch, but  it's so good that you keep laughing the entire time.  So, it's really good.  But, you know, I've enjoyed it there, and I've had a lot of fun. 
[01:31:00]  And no Madden yet, but we're working on that.  Oh, yeah.  For football season, when he really gets out there, you know.  Yeah.  And it really kicks in.  I wonder how they're going to deal with all that stuff, this.  I don't know.  I've been holding my breath for Pat Sumrall's observations.  I don't know about that.  I'm thinking Madden could help Tom Brokaw on the nightly news.  On NBC.  Yeah, nightly news.  With the diagrams of the battle plan.  He has had such a hard time, poor Tom Brokaw.  Osama bin Laden. 
[01:31:30]  Osama bin Laden.  Hey, if you try and say the words better, people will understand you more.  Great broadcasters are like great football, and if you're not a great speaker, it's hard  to be a great broadcaster.  But Joe Montana wasn't the greatest athlete.  Hey, that's what...  You think the American people would mind if me, Tom Brokaw, just call him Osama. 
[01:32:00]  I don't think they're going to mix him up with Osama Jones or Osama Smith.  If his last name was Smith, it would be a lot better, but it isn't, so it wouldn't be  better, and that's why I'm sticking to football.  Well, if Ashley's halibut to turn over Osama bin Laden, that is a horrible little lisp to  try to work your way around on a nightly basis.  His mouth moves in ways only someone having a grand mal seizure can get their mouth to 
[01:32:30]  those distorted things to try to work those words out.  When he saw the centers going down, it was like, great, is this Osama?  I can't pronounce Osama.  I can't say the little word.  The end of the sentence is like he's having an orgasm.  Yeah.  I saw Brokaw for NBC.  Oh, no.  My problems with Osama.  Oh, God.  Oh, please.  There's somebody underneath that desk?  Could that be the answer to the question, whatever happened to Connie Chung? 
[01:33:00]  Judy Woodruff with that skanky neck of hers.  Yeah, they're all getting a lot of FaceTime, though.  All the reporters.  Because they love, you know, before this happened, they were all talking about how the news  organizations were getting bad ratings.  There they go.  There they go.  Now they could be happy.  What do you think of Paul is on there, Paul?  She's hot.  I do her.  Paul is on.  Paul is on on CNN.  She's a little like...  I don't like the smirk on her face.  She's a little pompous.  Exactly.  A little pompous.  A perpetual smirk. 
[01:33:30]  Exactly.  You know, first of all, you're not even a natural blonde.  Let's start there.  She hasn't washed her hair in about a second.  And I know she's not a natural blonde.  I've been there.  You guys had a little tete-a-tete, as it were?  A little tete-a-tete.  Yeah.  You say it so easy.  You give her $2 million, you give her $2 million over here.  Yeah.  That's a real conflict.  Yeah.  She didn't have a nice rack.  You think she put some of it up top.  Pack them in.  So, Frank, you're getting a good write-up in TV Guide, my friend. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, did you see that?  Yes.  Congratulations.  Oh, thank you so much.  You know, I don't know what...  You know, I'm going to be honest with you.  I don't know how to act right now.  Because I feel like there's some good things happening in my life, you know?  Right.  And then you think about...  And I'm just being honest with you guys.  You feel a little guilty.  Yeah, I do.  Is that wrong?  Not at all.  Yes, it is.  Absolutely.  For the love of God, leave me alone. 
[01:34:30]  Why do you guys have to?  Yeah, it's weird for everyone.  We don't know what to do with this show.  Yeah, but to tell you the truth, you guys sound like you're having fun.  I think you've done really good shows.  Some radio stations I've been doing, you know, some around the country.  And, like, the one thing they ask me is, how do you go on and do it?  And I said, well, I just believe that I've been put on this, you know, earth to make people laugh.  And there's other people like that, too.  And that's just what I want to do right now.  Is it rough, though?  And you're going to the clubs? 
[01:35:00]  I've been going up at the Comedy and Magic Club.  And the audiences there have been awesome.  Yeah, I've been out the last few nights here in the city.  And they've been great.  I mean, that's like that stool that hit me in the head.  Other than that.  I think part of it is, if they're going out to the Comedy Club, they want to get a little bit of relief.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, just like the people that went to the Daily Show taping yesterday.  They just want a good laugh.  I warmed them up by saying, anybody have any cancer they want to talk about?  Oh, God.  Dead baby.  Anybody run over a dead baby?  Exactly.  Just to lighten the mood. 
[01:35:30]  Poor John, man.  No.  Did you catch that, Frank?  See John Stewart on the Daily Show?  No, I didn't see it.  Wow.  I mean, he did a great job.  He really did.  He talked for all New Yorkers.  And he was eloquent, you know.  Martin Luther King.  And the thing at the end where the set, he said basically, Frank, he said the way, from  where I sit, my apartment is in the village, I can see the World Trade Center.  It's gone.  But now I see the Statue of Liberty and you can't beat that.  It was just tremendous.  Yeah, that's phenomenal.  Yeah, it was really phenomenal.  It was pretty powerful.  If it wasn't goofy John Stewart saying it, it would have been so much more profound.  But no, he did really, he was very honest and wasn't afraid to let his emotions show, 
[01:36:00]  which is the sign of a true fag.  No, a true man.  Of course.  It goes to show you, like with Letterman and everybody, how brilliant of people these  people are.  You know what I mean?  All these, the speeches that the late night people and stuff like that have given, they've  all been fantastic.  You have to be more than a comedian.  You have to be a broadcaster.  What do you guys think of Dan Rather crying?  That was tough, huh?  It was tough, but I liked it. 
[01:36:30]  I thought it, I kind of admired him for being honest.  When he grabbed Letterman's hand, though, it was like, well, Letterman grabbed his arm.  Was it?  Yeah, it looked like Dan reached over with his hand to grab Dave's hand and then Dave grabbed  his arm.  Yeah, that was at the end.  In the middle, he grabbed his first time, I think, Dan grabbed Dave's hand.  Yeah.  It's almost like when Grandpa would get busted up about something and go, give me a hand.  I hate seeing anyone older than me cry.  That's my rule in life.  Yeah.  If you're older than me, I don't want to see you cry in front of me.  That's why I always feel comfortable punching my wife. 
[01:37:00]  He's younger than I am.  He's younger than you.  There's a parameter.  I have a certain level of ethics.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  All right, Frank, we'll let you go.  Well, thank you, guys.  You're going to come see us soon, hopefully?  Yeah, I'm going to be out at Bananas in the second week of October.  And so we'll come see you by then, hopefully.  Frank Caliendo.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  I have the worst cold on earth.  I've been trying to do impressions for the last two weeks, and everybody sounds like somebody with a cold. 
[01:37:30]  No, we look forward to checking you out on MADtv this weekend.  Hey, thanks, man.  It's really a very funny episode, too.  Cool.  All right, Frank.  All right, thanks, man.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All our friends checking in today.  Frank Caliendo, Anthony.  There he is.  I think we got the clip from Jon Stewart talking about the Statue of Liberty.  Oh, yeah?  The view from my apartment was the World Trade Center. 
[01:38:00]  And now it's gone.  And they attacked it.  This symbol of American ingenuity and strength and labor and imagination and commerce.  And it is gone.  But you know what the view is now? 
[01:38:30]  The Statue of Liberty.  The view from the south of Manhattan is now the Statue of Liberty.  You can't beat that.  So we're going to take a break, and I'm going to...  You ever think you'd see the day that you hear something like that coming from Jon Stewart?  We've had him on the show a bunch of times. 
[01:39:00]  If that isn't a...  Are you ready to laugh moment?  Wow.  He really did a great job last night.  What were you guys...  You know, what were you guys thinking?  What was the whole...  Well, it was really quiet.  I mean, afterwards, you know, during commercial break, everybody was down in the studio.  Were all the chicks that work at the Daily Show crying and stuff?  Oh, Jon.  There were guys...  I mean, it was really moving.  And again, everybody's standing around.  And you're just looking...  I can't even look at you in the eye.  You start making me laugh.  That's what I thought was when he's uncomfortable, though, Paul. 
[01:39:30]  I know.  And everybody...  It's very uncomfortable to talk about this type of thing.  Yeah.  What happened was, for the entire commercial break in the studio, all the staff that was  there, nobody said a word to anything.  Everybody just sort of stood there and just took it all in.  It was amazing.  It was just amazing.  That was a powerful moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Matt, what's going on?  All right, everybody.  When we come back from...  Hold on, hold on.  Jon's going to come out now.  I really appreciate you.  You really sounded sincere in your utter, complete silence. 
[01:40:00]  Now, what's up?  What's up?  Long-time listener, first-time caller.  All right.  Actually, just calling to plug Mr. Mercurio.  Next Saturday, I'm going to see him with, like, 40 guys at Stress Factory in New Jersey.  Oh, thank you very much.  Really excited.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Paul kills.  We're going to be right in the front, about, like, 45 people, the 8 o'clock show on Saturday  night.  All right.  We'll talk to you.  Matt, right?  Is that your name?  That's right.  I'll get you.  I'll chat you up, man.  Thanks for calling.  That's really nice of you.  I appreciate it.  All right.  You guys are doing great.  Thanks, Matt. 
[01:40:30]  Let's go to Vinny.  Vinny, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, Ope.  Were you sitting next to John Stewart with a bottle cap?  Yeah, I said the same thing.  We watched the tape in the office, and John, in between trying to get his breath and everything,  he took those delays to try to get his composure, and he was tapping his pen on the desk.  And all I can think of is, Opie does that all the time, and it annoys the crap out of  listeners.  It annoys the crap out of everyone.  Hey, Ope.  Yeah.  I never noticed it.  When you went down to Paisano's last night, did your T-Rex arms get in your pockets? 
[01:41:00]  See ya.  All right.  No, it cost me a fortune last night.  What was your party last night?  Just a...  No, we were just kind of hanging out.  It cost you a fortune.  It cost Sandy a fortune.  Well, who do you think gives her the money?  You idiot.  That's Opie reaching for that wallet.  Oh, those little T-Rex arms.  That is God's joke right there.  Those big, beastly creatures with the big teeth, the huge legs, and they got those little arms 
[01:41:30]  trying to get the wallet.  Opie, we're getting coffee now.  Everybody pitching for coffee?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  Opie?  All right.  Come on.  No, we had fun last night.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We're going to get a douche or dressing update from Scorch.  He's on the line.  Thank God.  We'll explain that to Paul.  Paul Mercurio from the Daily Show.  Douche or dressing.  In the studio.  Also, Anthony, we've got to play some of the really bad tribute songs. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, we went into this yesterday.  A lot of people like this.  We've just been pounded with these things.  So we can play a few more really bad ones.  I'm sure there are people that have written some really good ones.  It's very touching.  Do you guys have the air conditioner on in here?  Are you okay?  I don't know what's wrong.  Do you need a doctor or something?  See?  Thank you.  That was coming through your shirt.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Paul.  This never happens.  By the way, I can't get my wife pregnant either. 
[01:42:30]  No, I can't.  We've been trying to have another kid.  I can't get her pregnant.  Really?  No, not that the medical people say that there's anything wrong.  I just can't step up.  I don't know what it is.  The two may be related, man.  It looks like you're dripping sperm right now.  You know, it's true that the testes do have to stay at a lower temperature.  You know what it is?  I have new boxers on.  Is that?  No, that's okay.  No, we don't need to see your boxers on.  Because they're probably drenched in sweat.  I have a new banana.  Do you need some quinine for your malaria? 
[01:43:00]  No, it's not what they hate people.  Bastards, turn the heat, the air conditioner on.  Look at the front of his shirt.  Shut up.  The sweat stain is starting to look like a map of Afghanistan.  You know what's strange?  Earlier today, Ben had to leave.  You know Ben.  Oh, I heard.  Yeah, he slipped through blue or something.  They were blue and he was freezing cold.  Yeah, see, there's something going on.  I don't know what's going on.  I'm getting a little scared.  I don't, listen, I don't sweat like this normal.  The CDC have anything to say on those?  I think everyone's got the captain trips. 
[01:43:30]  You don't have the air on.  That's the problem.  All right, turn on the air for Paul Mercurio.  Thank you.  Anthony, so we'll come back.  We'll play some more of these Bad Tribute songs.  That's going to go into a delirious, fever-based hallucination.  Of course, what I'm drinking is actually helping the situation.  Sam Adams.  There you go.  Break the fever with alcohol.  Yeah, dehydrate your body more.  The listeners love in the Bad Tribute songs.  We'll do a few.  So as we go to break, because we've got to get the mood back up a little bit, can we play  Gay Marco's tribute song?  Oh, God. 
[01:44:00]  Gay Marco called in with a song, and it was a little dance number show tune sounding thing,  of course.  Who would expect anything different from him?  So in case you missed it yesterday, this is our buddy, believe it or not, Gay Marco.  Hey, Mr. Ben Laden, listen to me.  You're messing with the land of the brave and the home of the free.  It's a show tune.  It's a show tune.  It's a show tune.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something? 
[01:44:30]  We just keep it nice.  In the military, you might get shot by a great big fairy.  So poor little Osama, you should have listened to your mama and not been such a big bully.  We're going to kick your butt in.  Hang on to your turban.  Our bombs are going to do you in.  It's just about time for you to pay.  Watch out for the big bad USA. 
[01:45:00]  You're a girl.  That was the best song we heard today.  Wow, there you go.  I'll say it.  You know something?  I bet it's even better.  That's a winner.  I bet it's even better with the dance number.  How did you know?  I was dancing all over the room as I was singing it.  Oh, God.  Top hats, canes.  The Roaring 20s.  I could see it now.  Like a Busby Berkeley musical.  The homo faggot queer. 
[01:45:30]  Have you ever seen the people that listen to the show?  Bobby and Anthony.  Toothless, drunk, and white trash.  Ah, you got drool.  Hey, Anthony, WWF Unforgiven on pay-per-view this Sunday, huh?  This Sunday.  Brought to you by Clearasil.  Sorry.  Own call, Steve Austin.  Continue his reign as WWF champion.  Oh, well, Kurt Angle, an Olympic hero, of course.  Regain what was once his. 
[01:46:00]  Order WWF Unforgiven live this Sunday.  Pay-per-view.  Brought to you by Clearasil.  Plus, the people's champion, The Rock, takes on WCW owner Shane McMahon.  And former champion Booker T in a two-on-one handicap match.  At stake, The Rock's WCW championship.  Will Shane O'Mac and The Book be enough to take the title back from the great one?  And once an inseparable tag team.  Now, brother against brother.  Christian against Edge.  Christian jealous of Edge's success.  It puts these former seven-time tag team champs against one another for the intercontinental title. 
[01:46:30]  Don't miss a minute of it.  It's WWF Unforgiven on pay-per-view this Sunday at 8.  Call your local pay-per-view provider to order.  And if you're in New York City, see Unforgiven live on the 30-foot screen at WWF New York.  Call them up, 212-398-2563.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, with the bar, the bang, the dang, diggy, diggy, diggy. 
[01:47:00]  Diggy, diggy, diggy, diggy, said the boogie, said up, jump the boogie.  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never been so good.  Diggy, diggy, diggy, said the boogie, said up, jump the boogie.  Forever in blue jean.  Diggy, said the boogie, said up, jump the boogie.  In America.  My name is Neil. 
[01:47:30]  If you're not in the New York area, 866-277-4WOW is your phone number.  Cracklin' Rosie, get on board.  We're going to ride till there ain't no more to go.  Hey, Keith, what's up?  Hey.  Is it me? 
[01:48:00]  Keith, you're on the radio.  Yo, you hear me?  I hear you.  Yeah, go.  Oh, yeah, sorry.  I thought you had a better connection.  Hey, you know, I'm all four firemen.  Don't get me wrong.  See, it's great these guys volunteer to have a living, have a job, where they're running  the bills, and they're saving people, they're putting on fires, and it's great.  Uh-oh.  But they've got piss poor ideas when it comes to fund rates.  Why is that?  These guys are standing in the middle of a divided highway, holding up Russia.  Are you inconvenienced, Keith?  Hold on.  You're just cursed.  We're going to strap you to a missile and send you into Afghanistan. 
[01:48:30]  Keith, I'm sorry, are the firemen raising money for victims, for families of the dead  firefighters, is that inconveniencing you a little bit in your commute?  Is that what it is, Keith?  You're a little inconvenienced, right?  Yeah.  You're a douchebag.  Oh, then I completely understand with his inconvenience.  Does he get me inconvenienced?  I'm moving right on.  I'm not even going to address that.  There.  I'm done. 
[01:49:00]  That's what Tom Brokaw would have done.  I'll hang up on him.  You are a tool, my friend.  You're a tool.  Ball with the ball, the bang, the bang, the bang, the bang, the bang, the bang, the bang.  We need a douche or dressing update.  My name is Tom.  Hey, Scorch.  Douche or dressing.  Douche or dressing.  Hang on one second.  You'll probably hear my dog bark.  See, there you go.  Hey, there's a dog. 
[01:49:30]  There's a dog.  Hey, can I do it?  Yeah, everything's going cool, man.  Let me, if I can, I've gotten, people have called around from Sacramento that have been  listening that said, hey.  Are they digging the Scorch, man?  It's just kind of, well, people I've worked with or people I've been, my mother's hated  me.  She hated the fact I've been on radio until all of a sudden one of her clients, they said,  Scorch is your son, right?  And she called me up.  She's like, are you being on the radio in Philadelphia?  See, you are the, you are probably the most well-known jock that is in one city, and that  is Syracuse. 
[01:50:00]  And I owe it all to you.  Around the country.  People know Scorch.  Scorch.  Screw all that crap.  Everyone needs an update.  How did douche or dressing go for that?  Okay, douche or dressing, it was actually very good.  The first time we did it, I stuck to just the vinegar and water in the Italian dressing,  because that's, for right now, for the first one, it was good enough.  We probably had 30 people, including 11 girls.  Give them away tickets to a rock on Rawl's show, and you know, there's one in every crowd.  So, at the end of the whole thing, this guy, I had one pair of tickets left, and I'll drink  it, and of course, it was the douche, and he enjoyed it. 
[01:50:30]  It kind of looked like a very interesting sidewalk chalk by the time we were done.  Could he tell the douche from the dressing?  We mixed, believe it, we mixed a little bit of oil in with the vinegar and water douche.  It really, truly, if you guys want to do this, it really has the texture of Italian dressing.  You should do yeast infection or ranch.  Oh, ouch, that's great.  Good night, everybody.  I will have to use yeast infection or ranch.  Yeast infection or ranch. 
[01:51:00]  Well, Scorch, we're going to pass on the douche addressing.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  That's your bit, man.  My show is not based on bits.  I'm not like a hokey, top 40 kind of DJ.  Thank you very much.  I needed that.  What are you going to be doing on the show on Monday?  I don't even know what I'm doing on Monday.  I mean, Thursday's going to be good, because Thursday, I've got Don King coming back, and that's  You've got Don King coming back.  You've had Don King on before.  Yeah, Don King is actually, you give him the 35 minutes to talk, and everything's cool.  He's the man.  Well, we can't even get Don King.  How come we can't get a convicted killer on our show? 
[01:51:30]  You know, you don't have the crackpot producers like I have here in Central New York.  I guess not.  But how is everything down in the city?  Is everything cool?  No, it's not cool.  It's not cool.  I mean, obviously, it's not cool.  I don't know if you've heard, but...  There was an incident?  Yeah, there was an incident down here.  I don't mean cool like that.  I mean, like, is everything kind of somewhat getting back to somewhat...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Little Italy, yeah.  Little Italy looks like a ghost town.  Yeah, things are getting right back to normal. 
[01:52:00]  Scorch, there's been a huge chunk taken out of the pinnacle of the free world.  Yes.  But everything's fine.  And no, I swear I've been taking my money in the middle of the street, man.  But I don't want to complain.  I don't want to complain.  Yeah, there's still good food, plenty of it.  I think Scorch is great at small talk.  You're real good, you know.  So how's things going on?  What's new?  How's things going with that one leg you have left?  Everything okay with that?  Hey, what's going on?  How's that stock market? 
[01:52:30]  I heard he lost a couple of bucks.  The king of the understatement.  Scorch, it's a disaster everywhere around us.  Yeah, we were in Little Italy last night.  Yeah.  And I swear to God, usually you walk down Mulberry Street.  Yeah.  This time of year, too, they got the festival.  They got the San Gennaro feast going on, which has been canceled.  So usually, nice early fall weather or whatever it is.  It's still summer, technically.  I don't know.  Anyway, I think we're into the Indian summer phase. 
[01:53:00]  Nice weather, let's just say.  And the tables out on the sidewalk packed with people eating in front of these restaurants.  There was no one, I mean, even in the restaurants, to the point where you walk by, usually one  of the waiters, a maitre d' from another restaurant will go, sir, would you like a table?  You know, and now I'm going up the road.  So last night, it was like, please, can you sit?  I have my daughter here.  Why am I French?  I have my...  That makes up my accent.  That's how distraught...  I have my daughter here. 
[01:53:30]  Suddenly, you're in Paris in World War II.  We were the resistance.  Well, that's how distraught they are.  That's how they've got.  You see, they're so...  Maybe that's why no one was going in.  They wanted an Italian restaurant.  There was a French suit out front.  I am such a dick.  Oh, we have the Italian cuisine.  Meatball.  Hey, you want the le meatball?  Oh, what a dick.  Hopefully next week, we'll head, I don't know, where we're going to head.  We have salad with douche on it. 
[01:54:00]  Ranch or yeast?  All right, Scorch, we just want to check in to make sure everything went well with douche  or dressing.  Yeah, it was actually okay.  Have you guys noticed yourself looking up in the sky at every single plane that flies  by now?  There's no air traffic over Manhattan anymore.  Nothing at all?  No, I think they are diverting any plane, so it's about five miles away from Manhattan.  That's something I talked about this morning.  It's amazing.  Everybody, virtually every single person said it. 
[01:54:30]  It just, not that they're going to be frightened of death of every aircraft that flies by, but  every airplane that flies by they're looking at.  So how many biplanes fly over Syracuse every day?  Well, we've got those pedal planes.  Is that what it is?  An ultralight?  Yeah, you know, but everything.  Five o'clock, Charlie?  So happy birthday to me on Sunday.  Hey, thank you very much for letting me be the most unknown known DJ in the world.  No problem, Scorch.  And you guys have a great weekend.  Happy Rush Shanna.  Happy Rush Shanna.  Totally nude radio.  Scorch.  Kingdom of Naked.  On the Kingdom of Naked.  God bless you both. 
[01:55:00]  All right.  By the way, I'm not sweating anymore.  Hey, Jay.  Did we lose Jay?  No, he should be there.  Jay Moore.  Hey, Jay.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Scorch is flying a biplane?  Well, it's a long story.  What is he, Thurman Munson?  How bad am I that I go to Scorch instead of Jay Moore?  No, that's okay.  I enjoyed listening to him.  And you know what I got out of it?  I thought Neil Diamond doing Kid Rock was about as good as it gets.  And I got news for you. 
[01:55:30]  Tom Brokaw is about as funny as it gets.  Tom Brokaw might have to start singing.  My name is Tom.  That guy is hammered.  I like that.  NBC Nightly News.  Look at my mouth during the broadcast of NBC Nightly News.  It looks like I'm trying to do a tongue twister with a mouth full of Novakine.  My shoulders are getting thinner.  It's amazing.  Who's that?  Mercurial?  Yeah, buddy.  How you doing, man?  How you been?  Are you in L.A.?  I like when I recognize comics before the jokes come out.  Are you in L.A.?  Yeah, I'm in L.A. 
[01:56:00]  My wife's home, finally.  Yeah.  Did I tell you guys what happened to my wife's plane?  No.  Hey, what airline is the F-ing airline?  Do they serve snacks?  Do they serve snacks?  Fly F air.  I am so sorry.  That's right.  We got to do that.  I get a little passionate when it comes to my number one freedom, my beautiful wife.  All right, so what happened?  Sitting there for two hours, all of a sudden, 15 federal marshals with shotguns come on and  arrest five guys off of her plane.  Really? 
[01:56:30]  The three of them turned out to be on the FBI's watch list.  The other two were running up and down the aisle, sniffing everyone's ass as they hold  their luggage.  Was this an LAX?  No, this is at JFK.  I think it made the news, actually.  But I was on the phone with her the whole time, and I was freaking out, but I'm like,  oh, no, honey, this is completely normal.  They're doing this now.  Yeah, yeah.  It's normal.  They're showing you how safe it is.  Baby.  She should have drove back to L.A.  Yeah, taking a drink.  Well, she's here, and she's safe.  God bless her.  Wow. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, I want to ask you guys something.  Yeah.  It's not often you can find a beard as attractive as your wife.  Yeah.  I mean, as far as gay guys go, I have it good.  You really do.  Because when I do feel like having, like, heterosexual sex, I got that ringer.  That's great.  So as far as gay actors go with beard wives, I have the hottest beard wives.  Kelly Preston has nothing on Nicole Ann Moore.  So what were you going to say, Jay?  October 7th, I'm doing the Beacon Theater. 
[01:57:30]  Right.  With Stephen Lynch.  With Stephen Lynch and Michael DiNicola.  Mm-hmm.  And I wanted to invite you guys down, and I wanted to make it, I wanted to make it, I  want to make sure everyone knows it's not a plug.  I want you guys to know, I really feel passionate about this.  I'm not going to make a dime on this show.  Everything I make, I want to give Colladder Company No. 1 on 43rd Street, which was Rescue  Company No. 1 on 43rd Street, which is right next to my apartment.  All those guys lost their lives. 
[01:58:00]  And, I don't know, I just thought it would be great if we could all rally together and  go out, like, just have a big American party October 7th.  Well, you know, we'll be there.  Hell yeah.  Take all the money.  I'm not going to make a dime.  It's not like, hey, come on out and line my pockets.  Right.  You know, we don't have, these guys shouldn't be in the median for quarters.  I'm going to give them a big check, or cash, or whatever I'm going to give them after this  Beacon Theater date.  We're going to take all the money, and we're going to hand it to them.  They want to buy beer, fine.  They want to buy a ladder, fine.  But they're going to have it. 
[01:58:30]  Maybe they get a ticket on that F-air line you were talking about.  F-air.  They do serve snacks.  That's great, man.  That's very cool, man.  Good for you, man.  October 7th, Beacon Theater with Stephen Lynch, Mike DeNicola, and Jay Warren.  Yeah, we'll hang.  Yeah, man, and all that money is going to the fire department.  I'm not Rescue One, baby.  I'm not doing that for my checkbook, baby.  What's right is right.  That's my idea.  I was going to do that.  I was going to get in the coffin.  I was going to do a benefit.  I was going to do a benefit for Philip Morris. 
[01:59:00]  You should have heard him the other day on the air.  The guy wants to do a radio phone.  He goes, I want to get together with you guys.  You set me up in Los Angeles with a radio station.  I'll be out there.  You guys here.  I'll get all kinds of celebrities.  And we're going to raise money on a radio dung.  Me, Wheels, Cheese, and Nicky.  Everything.  That radio dung, da-dung, dung, dung.  And we would die. 
[01:59:30]  And we're like, hey, guys, I think someone's doing that.  We've got every major network and cable station.  Dr. Dre just gave a million dollars.  Dr. Dre.  The telethon's on tonight.  We're like, Dice, someone beat you to it.  Someone kind of beat you to it.  The moment with Dice that I loved was when you started playing the music behind him.  Oh, yeah.  And just in the middle of this really eloquent speech, you just now go, stop the music.  Stop the music.  Like your father getting mad at you.  Wasn't it?  Like a switch went off, which means if the emotion's that close, you know what I mean? 
[02:00:00]  It was like, how deep were you into that thing you were talking about?  What else was great is when we started playing the Dice clips, and he turns around and starts  going, I'm not going to argue with me.  We have a short clip of that.  We've got to play it.  Jay, hold on the line.  I want to hear it.  Hold on.  Here it is.  Dice arguing with himself.  We're playing clips, and he's just arguing with himself.  Check this out.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Henry, don't stop you.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hang the phone up, you skank. 
[02:00:30]  Hang the phone up, you skank.  I'm not going to argue with me.  I'm not going to argue with me today.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  No, you don't.  You see, I'm not going to do that.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Stop it.  Don't talk to me like that.  I'm over here now.  Excuse me.  I'm over here now.  Hey, I'm over here now, because you said I'm over here now.  Oh, excuse me.  I didn't know you were everybody.  Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo. 
[02:01:00]  Boogaloo, boogaloo.  Boogaloo, boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Look what I did to you.  Again.  Yeah, well, maybe I'll do it to you this time, big shot.  Nice.  Be nice.  Nice.  Don't tell me to be nice.  I came in here with my lady, you open your mouth, and I do this to you, and everybody  goes with their hand, and then you hear this.  I like the tape dice.  I like the dice on tape.  You like the dice on tape? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  I don't even understand the way I talk.  Now they don't know if it's me or the tape.  You got so much stuff on me, you could just piece together conversations.  Yeah.  Look what I did to you again.  Wait, let me do it with it.  Tell me when.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Here I am.  Ready?  Hang the phone up, Drew.  No, that's not one.  Which one?  The other thing.  The other thing for you, said what? 
[02:02:00]  About him now.  Can we get back to him now?  You know, everybody's going to think this is a goof.  It's not going to be set up.  You know what?  And now that we've talked about it, somebody else is going to do it, and you're going to  look like idiots.  All right.  Stop it now.  God damn.  You're going to look like idiots.  There's Dice off.  You're going to look like idiots.  Arguing with himself from the show the other day.  I'm not going to argue with me.  Hey, we lost Jay.  What happened?  Oh, crap. 
[02:02:30]  I didn't hang up on that.  Where'd Jay go?  All right.  Well, we should take a break anyway.  That's really nice of him doing that.  That's great.  And we've got to play a couple of these bad tribute songs before we get out of here.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  How about we take a quick break, and we'll do that next, okay?  Roy.

Corey, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say first off that I'm sorry what happened to your town.  And you guys are doing a hell of a job.  And I just, I have a fear that I don't think it's going to be as brutal as we want it to be, which I think I should just wipe them all out. 
[02:05:00]  But the one reason why I'm really cold, I know a bunch of people, I know everybody's heard, a bunch of, you know, just keep going on and on about bombing, bombing, bombing.  But you cannot get through to Schlocko.  You cannot get through to him at all.  He will not pick up his phone.  And, you know, I didn't realize how fake it was until you guys opened up my eyes.  And I'm going to Tool tonight at Great Woods. 
[02:05:30]  And I hope I can get a BCN.  I hope I can get a bunch of stickers for a while and just load them up on their truck.  But you guys are doing a great job and keep it up.  Thank you, Corey.  You're welcome.  Thanks, Corey.  You know, the weed's kicking in.  That's cool.  All right, Corey.  Thank you.  There's Corey.  That was good because it gave me a little more time to just zone out.  I was in a whole other, like, dimension.  You needed a transfer for that bus ride. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  I slipped into a completely different dimension where things had five dimensions for a split second.  I swear to God, I was there.  It's been a long week and we're running out of energy.  We've got to get through five more World Trade Center tribute songs.  Oh, this will re-energize me.  This is my favorite part of the show this week, Anthony.  Of course it is.  We've been having a lot of fun with the songs that are being sent in to every radio station in America.  I don't think there's enough of them out there.  Now, you know, we understand that people are pouring out their emotions and expressing them. 
[02:06:30]  We understand all that, okay?  Yeah.  But come on.  These songs suck.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Hey, Dice.  Yeah.  Hi, Dice.  All right.  This is what I got for you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I've been working on this thing.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  You're sitting down now?  We're sitting down.  All right.  Number one, I got Fabio. 
[02:07:00]  You thought it couldn't happen.  I can't throw.  With the goose or without.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  You got to reenact the bird.  Wait.  I got more.  With the goose in the face or not?  I got more.  You got Fabio for the radio talk.  We got Fabio with that bird.  When Fabio rode that roller coaster and got hit in the face by the bird.  Yeah, so we're going to reenact that.  Could be the funniest moment ever in television.  Listen to me now.  We're going to reenact that for the people watching.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  A lot of visual things. 
[02:07:30]  We got to work it out somehow.  A visual for the radio.  Can you get Ramchop?  No, you were talking about dogs.  Dogs.  Hi, guys.  Let me tell you who I got now.  Yeah.  Benji agreed.  We got Benji.  Oh, Benji the dog.  Benji the dog.  Because remember the other day you were talking with dogs?  The dogs.  One of the lassies.  I don't know which one.  The one with cerebral palsy?  Yeah.  I'm trying for the top lassie.  Hip dysplasia.  Okay.  And then we got that air bud dog. 
[02:08:00]  He says to me like this, I'll do some of the...  There we go.  Thanks.  We can go on with the show now.  We'll be playing some of the tribute songs today.  Why do I feel that number is going to ring again really quick?  Well, can we maybe get a portion of one of the bad tribute songs on before he calls back?  Now I get you.  Now the city's been having a lot of trouble with their phones with this whole thing.  Yeah, I know.  I feel bad.  Air bud.  Weather...  Oh, here he comes again. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, boy.  All right.  What happened, Dice?  Dice, what are you doing?  Don't play games.  You're wrecking our show.  Don't play games with your hangups.  You're wrecking our show.  What do you mean wrecking the show?  You know, there was no big deal when we were only on in New York.  Now we're all over the country and you still have that bad phone.  You're telling me I had to go get down.  Yeah, and you got Fabio?  I got more.  You didn't listen.  Did you see the lineup of this star-studded event that's going on tonight? 
[02:09:00]  What star-studded event?  Can you get Jeff Speakman?  Who?  Who?  What star-studded event?  Hold on.  There is a benefit going on on every network, on the TV, on radio, on cable, where celebrities  are going to raise money.  See, I thought they stole it.  You see what happens?  Because you weren't serious.  No, no.  I knew somebody would steal this thing.  They planned this, and it's going to be a big telethon.  When did they plan it? 
[02:09:30]  After we spoke about it?  No, beforehand.  I think you heard it.  And you came up and thought it would be a good idea because you heard it.  No, I didn't hear nothing.  You know me.  I think you did, Dice.  I got all my information from my friend.  So how are we going to compete with the likes of George Clooney?  And Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks.  What's he going to do?  Mariah Carey singing Hero.  What do we got?  This is our first nothing.  We got Benji.  This is our first performance.  Mariah Carey is going to have an emotional breakdown on the telethon. 
[02:10:00]  Since the loony bin, right?  That's how committed she is to this.  Who's not going to want to see that?  And we got one in the last days.  You don't even know which one.  You know, I'm trying.  Get the one with mange.  You're the one that pushed the dog thing.  I didn't even care about the dogs.  And by the way, Air Bud only has three legs.  Air Bud's dead.  He had three legs.  He had three legs, but then he died.  Oh, the humanity.  All right.  Well, we'll do things.  You know, there's a lot we can do.  Who do you got? 
[02:10:30]  Can you auction off the postal uniform you had on that Fox TV show?  Yeah, I got a lot of things.  When you were just Andrew Clay?  Yeah, we got Bill.  I dropped the dice.  Come on, you know that was for cash.  Drop the dice, nicey-nice.  Nicey-nice.  You know something nice?  That's the best thing I've heard you say.  You know, that's the honest dice right there.  I did it for the cash.  Shut up.  You know, why do you show up every day? 
[02:11:00]  I hear you.  F for the cash.  That was my whole idea with the radio song.  That we do something that isn't about the cash.  Yeah.  You understand?  Yeah.  Yeah, what?  Hey, are we going to get Wilson the volleyball from...  I can't believe they took our idea.  When's this tell it to happen?  I think you can get a salesman from Foot Locker to come on.  Tonight.  Tonight?  It's huge.  It's multi-network telecast.  Dice, Dice, do we or...  I don't understand.  Nobody told me about that.  I got a key grip coming in from Ford Fan Lane. 
[02:11:30]  Do we or do we not have Wilson from Castaway?  We don't want any of those.  Listen, who's Wilson?  Everyone knows Wilson from Castaway.  You didn't see Castaway?  Do we have Wilson from the radio song?  Movie.  Oh, the movie with Tom Hanks?  Yeah.  Where you been?  He's a volleyball.  It pulls us up on the ice.  You know how I am.  Where you been?  What do you mean where I've been?  Where you been?  Where you been?  Now I see where we're going with this. 
[02:12:00]  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Which way?  By the way, happy birthday.  To who?  One of you.  No birthdays.  No one's birthday.  Happy face.  Tell me it's one of your birthdays.  Happy face is wrong.  Man.  Hey, are you doing, um, are you doing, um, uh, another Ford Fan Lane movie?  I don't know.  Am I?  Are you?  Or what?  Let me see.  What's that, Opie?  Uh, ask him if there's a sequel to The Adventures of Ford Fan Lane that's coming out.  Buick LeSabre.  Who just said ask me? 
[02:12:30]  Why couldn't you ask me?  I'm reading something.  This guy says Max from San Francisco.  wants to know if you're, uh, if there's a sequel coming out.  I don't know.  If there is, I don't know about it.  Maybe they won't cast you.  Starring Pauly Shore.  Yeah.  Hey, the whistle, I'm fulfilling.  I think that would work.  Hi, you want jokes?  How can you, how do you know, wait, let me get it all together in my head. 
[02:13:00]  Take some oxygen.  How do you recognize a head nurse?  Do you, she's the one with dirty knees.  Bop!  Bop!  What?  Why do elephants have four feet?  Because eight inches isn't enough.  Bop!  You're probably scaring your cat.  How do you keep a moron in suspense?  Say nothing!  Bop!  No, you're not.  You're just supposed to say nothing. 
[02:13:30]  Right?  You're supposed to say nothing.  Because how do you keep a moron in suspense?  And the guy goes, how?  And then you say nothing.  And then you just don't say a word.  You don't say nothing, but we're on telephone.  So you could.  I've got to explain it.  But you can't explain it.  It takes away from the joke.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  There was no...  So we'll do a lot of those.  I'll repeat those.  We should make you negotiate with bin Laden.  Please.  You know what I would do?  You know, I'll tell you this right now.  All right.  Like if I was the president.  Yeah.  You know. 
[02:14:00]  Which is perfectly conceivable.  Yeah, well, I'm a leader, my friend.  You know what I mean?  I'd know what to do.  Okay.  All right.  What would you do?  Well, number one, I'd come on.  I'd say it like this.  You know, I look at the camera, like he did.  Right.  And I go, you know what we're going to do to them?  I don't even want to say what we're going to do to them.  Very concise.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's how angry I think.  It doesn't clutter the mind.  Exactly.  So you let them know you're going to do, but you're not saying what you're going to do, 
[02:14:30]  because then everybody's going, oh, this is bad.  And then you end it with, Bob.  Yeah.  Oh, wait, let me try it again.  All right.  You know what we're going to do to them?  I don't even want to say what we're going to do to them.  Bop!  It's not bop, it's bop.  There's a big difference.  Which way, bop or bop?  I like the bop.  Bop.  No, it was bop.  We like the bop.  Let me try it with a bop.  All right.  You know what we're going to do to them?  What? 
[02:15:00]  I don't even want to say what we're going to do to them.  Bop!  Yeah.  It's bop.  I like bop.  Yeah, bop might be one.  Try bing.  Bing?  No, no.  That's like when you're in bed with a chick, you only use that.  Just go bing.  Like after you give it a kiwi cream, you go like this.  Is that with the hair or without?  You go like this.  Yeah.  Bing.  Like what I did to you.  You don't have to drive behind it.  No, no.  You know what I mean?  More of an accent on the bing. 
[02:15:30]  You're going to make the hair down there stand on end, you know what I'm saying?  No, I told you that joke.  Yeah.  What did I make the hair down there curly?  Why?  Why?  So don't poke in the eye and bop!  So what are you doing there today?  We're hanging out.  Hey, I got one for you.  How do you keep Dyson's?  Hey, why do you got to be me to do me?  I can't do me.  I can't do me.  Boop!  How do you keep Dyson's suspense? 
[02:16:00]  There you go.  All right.  Can we play one of these bad tribute songs?  Boop!  A boop!  Boop!  The listeners need to hear another bad tribute song.  Of course.  And he's redialing right now, you know.  There he is.  Oh, come on.  All right, hold on.  Can we get one in?  Bing!  We got five of these.  Boop!  Boop!  When you answer it, answer it.  Like Dyson's with Tourette's.  So I'm online at the bank. 
[02:16:30]  I gave a guy, guy.  And I got my tongue up this chick.  He's a good guy, guy, guy.  He's a good guy, guy, guy.  Boop!  I'd like it medium rare.  Boop!  Boop!  Dyson's, it's like you and Tourette's.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  I'm on the phone.  Boop!  What's up with the boop?  Get out of here.  You talk to everyone like that.  I'm calling about my account balance.  Hello?  A boop!  I want to know if my car's done in the shop. 
[02:17:00]  A boop!  Anything like that?  What's that?  Well, I was just yelling at somebody.  Well, Dyson, what do you got, man?  We got to do the show.  Yeah, but I'm here.  We got some awesome songs.  What?  So what are you doing?  You should get Wally Cox for your...  What is this?  Who is this?  Yeah, who's the imposter on the air now?  Oh, wow.  We got the...  Hey, Dyson, what's up? 
[02:17:30]  Hey, I don't know why you hang up on me and then you put an imposter on.  What's going on, Opie?  No, I'm sorry.  I thought...  Yeah, who's this now?  Yeah, who are you?  Bump!  Hey, Blumbo!  Get out of my freaking phone time!  Yeah.  Who's this guy now?  Yeah, I'm Dyson.  You're not Bump!  No, no, no, no.  You're not.  I'm nobody now.  Yeah, you're nobody.  I'm somebody.  I'm Dyson.  I'm over here now.  You're nobody.  Bump!  I'm over here now.  Bump!  He said you're somebody.  No, you're not anybody. 
[02:18:00]  I'm somebody.  Excuse me.  I'm not your somebody.  You're an imposter.  Bump!  You know who you are now?  Who am I now?  Look at this.  Who are you now?  That's you.  Who are you?  Yeah.  Who am I?  This is you now.  Oh, this is you now.  This is what you are.  This is what you are.  Uh-huh.  Bump!  No, Bump!  I'm over here now.  I'm here for you.  Hey, hi.  Hey, ho.  I'm glad.  It's your main.  Hey, Dice.  Yes, it was open. 
[02:18:30]  I'm glad the real Dice finally called in.  I'm talking to you.  I got my own family.  I'm talking to you.  Enough of them.  All right.  Don't pick Dice up again.  All right.  Can we play the tribute songs?  Yeah, let's play some.  All right.  Where are we going?  I got the list right in front of you.  All right.  We're going to play a song called Never Again?  Yeah.  Never Again.  Fabulous.  Touching me already.  Great.  I know.  We understand these guys are, you know, they're pointing out their emotion and they're  expressing themselves.  But these things stink.  And we said on the radio all this week, why would you want to feel sadder? 
[02:19:00]  We're all sad.  And everyone is trying to make you sadder.  Paul, on The Daily Show, will you be getting in front of the camera like John did and talking  about the view from your apartment, the brick wall with the flashing red hotel sign?  No?  The hotel sign was put out for one minute.  It is a tribute.  It is a tribute to.  For one week, they are not admitting anyone with clap into the hotel. 
[02:19:30]  The clap.  Okay.  The clap.  Clap.  Clap.  All right.  So here's Never Again.  Never Again.  Oh, yeah.  Ain't that America?  Something to see, baby.  Something's never changed.  Yeah.  We're still the land of the free.  Oh, stop it.  You want to play the game?  You think we can play the rhyming game? 
[02:20:00]  Free.  C.  And no one can ever keep us from B.  You just need the word.  I say C.  C?  Okay.  Yes.  C.  Go ahead.  But it's different from now on.  A different kind of liberty.  Liberty!  God damn it!  All right.  We're on alert.  Proud and self-reliant.  Oh, stop.  Reliant?  Reliant? 
[02:20:30]  Defiant.  And we'll be defiant.  Defiant.  That's obvious.  Defiant?  Yes.  Defiant.  Boring eagle, not a sleeping giant.  Giant!  Wow!  You are such a disappointment to your family.  Son.  Never forget.  Never forget.  Stand tall.  Never give up.  He's the call.  Ah.  Never surrender.  Be a proud American and swear to God. 
[02:21:00]  Never again.  Ah.  There you go.  American.  Never again.  All right, let's play another round.  Here we go.  Get ready, Rick.  After it happened, I saw them laughing in the street.  All right, stop it.  Street, street, street, street, street.  No, no, I got to think about this now.  We're going off half-cocked.  We can't be discreet.  Street, street, street, street, meat, beat, meat, beat, meat.  We're going to send our fleet. 
[02:21:30]  Fleet, fleet.  A feet.  A secrete.  Secrete?  Yes.  Deet.  What about deet?  Isn't that the stuff that gets rid of deet?  Bugs.  Bugs.  Feet.  What are we rhyming with?  Street, right?  Oh, street.  Buddy Pete.  Watch out for my buddy Pete.  I think that's it.  Street.  All right, well.  I'd say beat.  Defeat.  All right, defeat.  I'll say defeat.  That's defeat. 
[02:22:00]  Time to even up the score.  And watch them cower in defeat.  Yeah!  We got one!  We got one!  Yeah!  Finally!  All right!  Finally!  Nice!  I was going to go for my buddy Pete.  But defeat.  All right, continue.  Let's get a little more.  Their fate is sealed.  Our strength is showing.  Showing.  Glowing.  Glowing!  Glowing.  Glowing?  Showing. 
[02:22:30]  Snowing.  It's winter's coming.  It's going to snow.  Showing.  Flowing.  Our pride is going to be.  Our pride is going to be flowing.  Glowing or glowing.  Showing.  Glowing.  Showing.  Flowing.  All right, let's go with glowing.  Blowing.  Blowing.  No.  Glowing.  Why does it always have to be what you want?  The winds of freedom will be blowing.  Something like that.  I don't mean like a BJ.  No, I know that.  All right, let's go.  All right.  All right. 
[02:23:00]  Blowing.  I'm going to say blowing.  You can say flowing.  I'll say blowing.  We can feel their fear as our pride is growing.  Glowing.  What about growing?  Why didn't we think of growing?  That's so obvious.  We stink as a group.  What rhymes with bump?  All right, hit it again.  All right.  Those who hurt our daughters and sons.  All right, is it the same line?  Never forget.  Stand tall. 
[02:23:30]  Never give up.  Heed the call.  Never surrender.  Be a proud American and swear to God.  No.  Never again.  Never again.  All right, here we go.  One more verse.  Time for action.  Time to strike back.  All right.  Time for justice.  Hit it.  Time to strike back.  Time for justice.  No, time to strike back.  Doesn't it rhyme with back?  I don't know. 
[02:24:00]  That was a weird verse.  Yeah, that was a weird verse.  Keep playing.  I hope nothing rhymes with back.  I'll rewind it.  No, that's all right.  Go.  And revenge.  Revenge?  And revenge?  That don't make sense.  No.  Time to show them just who we are.  Bring their evil to an end.  Revenge.  Never forget.  All right, here we go.  Forget.  Stand tall.  Never give up.  Give up.  Heed the call. 
[02:24:30]  Beep.  Never surrender.  Be a proud American and swear to God.  You know the first people we've played this for?  I'm going to shatter again.  Sears.  What?  Exactly.  The first people we've played this for was like his mother is on.  She was praying to his mother and he thought it was beautiful.  Never again.  Will this song be played?  All right, that's done.  When's this song going to be played?  Never again.  Never again.  All right, let's move on to the next one.  American Grace. 
[02:25:00]  American Grace by Paul Jones.  The one we just played was by Steve Bryant.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America.  Oh, boy.  One of these.  We had an actual tragedy.  The news.  This guy taped it on a reel-to-reel.  Listen to the quality of this.  Watson, come quick.  I knew it.  It's Amazing Grace.  It's Joe Cocker. 
[02:25:30]  You know, we don't have to go in and bomb.  That's horrible.  You know what the trick is?  Joe Cocker.  We don't have to bomb.  No.  Because they believe that these militant Islams believe that they're going to go to heaven.  So let's create a heaven for them.  Take one of those guns they use in the wild to stun animals.  Let's stun four of them and make them think they're dead. 
[02:26:00]  Put them in a white room.  And you have Sandra Bernhardt come in and work out her new one-woman show for them.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No.  Stop it.  That is not heaven.  We are so wrong.  Where are my 70 virgins?  It's you.  And then when Sandra needs a break, you bring in the chick from Weakest Link.  Goodbye.  You let that bitch go at it for a while.  Well, we could just get the paving cruise.  Just paving.  Yeah.  They go in at night.  They work at night the best. 
[02:26:30]  They're all sleeping.  They wake up.  It's a bunch of strip malls.  Whatever works.  I like the bombs better myself.  Any more?  Yeah, we got one called I'm Raging.  I'm Raging?  I'm Raging.  Another bad trivia song.  Raging Cajun.  Since I was young, boy.  I'm Raging Cajun.  I'm Raging Cajun. 
[02:27:00]  It reflects now through these short moments.  Which plague our open eyes.  Sounds like Crosby before the liver transforms.  Eyes?  And then I cry out.  Skies?  And then weep in wrongs.  I swallow my, my helpless day.  And who do you think you want to drive planes into my perfect home? 
[02:27:30]  What?  At least if you're going to do a tribute song, make it so we can hear the words.  Apparently his studio, his recording studio is a dumpster.  Yeah.  Well, you get off, and will you pay?  Oh, whoa.  Because I'm raging, I'm hating, the face pasted on the TV.  That's what Mama Cass sounded like before she choked on the ham sandwich. 
[02:28:00]  And bomb that terrorist land.  Because I know you, my, my vengeance, we stand up a nation.  Okay.  Wow, that was incredibly bad.  That was so bad, it was good.  Thank you.  Did it come all the way around to be good?  It came good.  It was so bad that all of a sudden you look on the other side and it's like, hey, it's back to go.  What happened?  It's so good.  What happened?  It's sing, he sings because he loves. 
[02:28:30]  That was the Naked Cowboy.  I'm raging.  He was doing that between support calls for H. Hewlett-Packard.  There was a little downtime.  Nobody's office jet was broken, so he had time to record a song.  Which one's this?  This one's called A Call to Solidarity.  Nice.  Resolving.  An American kicks the ass out of every other country.  Resolving.  An American kicks the ass out of every other country.  Journeys. 
[02:29:00]  Two thousand.  Journeys.  Two thousand.  Two thousand.  8.30 a.m.  September 11th, 2001.  The sun glistened upon two towers at the corner of an island on the edge of a metropolis.  Filling with men and women, workers and employers, some drew their shades, while others enjoyed the prism of the Tuesday light.  The West Coast, still asleep, while middle America turned to the horizon.  Is that Ed Hall from the Tonight Show? 
[02:29:30]  Is that Ed Hall from the Tonight Show?  Buildings, people, and trees split the light and changed its direction as it came from the heavens above.  What?  While four airplanes cast shadows on the earth that would soon bring darkness to a nation.  Is this a book report?  September 11th, 2001.  The world can't change.  Today we've had a national tragedy.  You have people jumping out the windows.  I knew a disaster was about to change.  Yeah, this really exists since a moment.  Over 200 years, wars have come and gone. 
[02:30:00]  Threats have been met and conquered.  And people have been looked in the face and sent back to hell.  For over 200 years, America has grown from its simple roots.  I think I was being brainwashed.  And Kevin Eubanks in the NBC Man.  I think I was being brainwashed.  Bop.  Okay.  Bop.  All right.  What's the next one?  War?  That was really bad.  War.  Good God, y'all.  What is it?  Is it done to that one?  War.  No.  Good God, y'all. 
[02:30:30]  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing.  Coming to America.  Cracklin' Rosie, get on board.  All right.  Another one, Anthony.  They're coming in like crazy.  War.  Shadows grow so long before my eyes.  I think we should hold hands.  What the hell?  Perhaps we have something.  Fireflies. 
[02:31:00]  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  I think there would be an inappropriate time to use that.  We need a talk box for it.  Then what, man?  Do you feel this darkness?  Okay, good.  We can play the rhyme game, maybe.  Is a soul shining bright?  To write?  Fight, fight, fight.  Glowing truth through the blindness.  Light, light, fight.  Spreading wings for the flash. 
[02:31:30]  Flight!  God damn it.  Ah.  That's very instrumental.  It'll give you time to reflect on his last verse.  This is like the Aaron Brown of music.  The battle's growing closer.  The battle's growing closer.  There's a quick flash to night. 
[02:32:00]  Okay, night, night.  Now it's got to be fight.  Of course.  He already used flight.  No, I'm going to say light because he's doing night.  Light?  Night, light.  That's, I'm going with light.  I got to go with fight again.  All right.  Fight.  Bite?  This bite.  I'm going to say, boop!  I told you not to bite!  I'll say fight.  Oh, where are you going?  I want might.  You want might?  All right.  Wow.  That's good.  Stupid enough.  Joining up with other soldiers.  There we go.  Fight.  Come in. 
[02:32:30]  We come together for the fight.  Yeah, winner!  Pick up the gun.  We've been hit by surprise.  Surprise.  Surprise.  Creamy thighs.  No?  No?  No?  It might not even be a rhymey line.  I'd say eyes.  The chorus.  Watch out for the smelly flies.  Surprise.  Surprise.  Disguise.  Disguise.  Disguise.  Disguise. 
[02:33:00]  Be brave, my friend.  No, the enemy tries.  Die.  Goddamn enemy tries.  What?  The enemy tries.  Oh, my God.  Oh, who saw that coming?  To back in our hearts.  With hatred and lies.  Flies.  It's a few rhymey words.  Which one of which we picked.  Surprise.  Guys?  I'm going with creamy thighs now.  This time we will not lose. 
[02:33:30]  Chocos are not easy.  I said I do.  I said I, guys.  You said I.  Earlier, but earlier.  I missed it.  It was the wrong one.  But I guess.  I saw him, Paul.  Puff.  Pick up your gun.  We must not want to go.  Live in the way of the way.  Let the enemy bring.  Don't you want to survive?  Alive. 
[02:34:00]  Survive alive?  Don't you want to survive?  Don't you want to survive?  Take it back down, John Lennon.  Underneath is darkness.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Now, here it comes.  It's a soul shining bright.  Bright.  Bright.  Again, with the ite.  Again, with the ite sound. 
[02:34:30]  Might is a person.  They've already used fight.  But he's going to use it again.  It's fight again.  I'm going to say flight.  Flight.  It's stupid.  How about sight?  It could say sight.  What do you think?  Might?  Fight.  I'm going to say might.  I'm going to say might.  Might.  Might.  Might.  I'm going to say flight.  It's fight.  Something about taking flight.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  It's I have no sight.  Is that it?  I think he really wants to let us know he's blind. 
[02:35:00]  How about it's every man's right?  Oh.  Don't fly a kite.  Yeah.  Blowing truth through the blindness.  Sight.  Sight.  It's going to be night.  We come together for the night.  It's the same line.  That's lazy.  That's crazy.  Do not ring that bell.  There's no creativity there.  Oh, my God.  It's a rip.  To use the same line again.  Pick up the gun. 
[02:35:30]  Pick up the gun.  We've been hit by surprise.  Keep me by the end.  Oh, we're on the end of the drive.  All right.  Well, there you have it there.  Enough of that.  Why don't they have some nice, easy songs that we play the rhyming game to?  We better take a break and come back with a quick game of what did we learn on the O&A show today?  Already?  Yeah, believe it or not.  Nothing you've imagined has prepared you for this. 
[02:36:00]  Hey.  Oh, come in here.  I'm gay.  I just barked mouth.  He said sit on it.  So I did.  Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.

[02:37:30]  Time to play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll start with Angela.  Angela, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Today I learned that the Pope has a lot of laminates.  Ah, yes, we did learn that.  Nice and early.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Come see us soon.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  I want to thank Paul Mercurio for stopping in today, too, Anthony.  Yes.  Thanks, guys.  From the Daily Show on Comedy Central.  Bananas this weekend.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Plug that.  Bananas this weekend out in Hasbro, Kite. 
[02:38:00]  It's going to be a good show.  Bop.  Bop.  Rob from Staten Island.  I learned three things.  I learned two new words, re and hab.  I learned Lisa, the sales girl, used to manage Spinal Tap.  I learned if you're sweating too much, wear a quilt.  Ah.  Hey, there you go.  Tommy writes, I learned French guys are trying to open restaurants in Little Italy.  Another time, I learned the best way to fame and fortune is to be a tin knocker.  A lot of people say, and I learned that the Pope has a lot of laminates.  Mike writes, today I learned that you don't need motion to be in pro motions. 
[02:38:30]  Promotion.  Ah, foo-foo.  Could be the best instant feedback of the day.  Hey, Earl should have thrown the beer barrels down the street like Donkey Kong, and the federal  agents could jump over them, and the firefighters could smash them open with their hammers to  get the beer out.  Now that would be a hell of a sight.  Do you have audio over here?  Let's see if that rings a bell. 
[02:39:00]  Here goes Earl.  Oh, he's getting the kegs through.  Oh, look at the FBI's jumping over him.  Or, someone's coming with hammers.  Oh, good, the fine men are breaking them open with their axes and getting the beer out  of it.  Thank God.  Donkey Earl.  Whoa, that FBI agent almost got Donkey Earl.  We are getting a look from Earl through the door right now. 
[02:39:30]  This is hate Earl day.  Oh, he knows.  He knows.  Uh-oh.  He's heading back to the NEW van to finish the game.  There he goes.  Oh, I'm getting to ground zero.  He's rolling the kegs.  Oh, now he's looping around, I think.  He's trying to loop it.  Uh-oh, and here comes Psycho, Mark.  Yeah, game over.  Damn.  Linda, what did you learn on the show today?  Hi, guys.  I learned two things.  One, Opie has a new gig.  He plays the bottle caps on The Daily Show. 
[02:40:00]  And also, Paul Mercurio sweats sperm.  Wow.  Did I make the radio?  Cool.  You're right.  Thank you, Linda.  Thank you.  Good night.  All right.  I didn't think that line made the radio.  Maybe I can get you pregnant.  Pluto.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that recorded dice.  It's actually brighter than real dice.  Oh, nice, Pluto.  Thank you.  Colonel Sanders, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I got a few here.  Yeah.  When Ant gets out of sorts, he turns French.  And when Opie sees the bill, he turns into the most terrifying of dinosaurs. 
[02:40:30]  And how did the birds get Fabio and the goose?  And the most obscure one is, thank God for the ambiguous pregnant Chad.  The ambiguous pregnant Chad.  Yes, yes.  Thank you.  Very obscure.  Thank you, Colonel Sanders.  Later.  All right.  Bushes.  Let's go out to Sacramento, California, Anthony.  Dave.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  What did you learn on the radio today?  I learned that Earl screamed, feet don't fail me now as he was running out the building. 
[02:41:00]  Amen.  He absolutely did.  Very good.  See you.  Thanks, Dave.  See you later.  You guys suck.  All right.  Bye.  Is that what happened, too?  Is that we have audio of Earl leaving us behind?  The fire department showed up earlier.  And he's the fire warden for this floor.  Oh, my God.  So here's Earl's warning to get out.  He just ran away, I think.  Yeah.  He's jumping over people.  Earl not alerting anyone, trying to get to the fire exit. 
[02:41:30]  He is stopping to have some keg beer right now.  Yes, that is rolling down the stairs after.  And, yep, out the front door.  There he goes.  Leaving everybody behind.  Good job, Earl.  Anthony, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, I learned that two groups and a Trans Am is the groups of hazard.  Bop!  Oh, look what I did to you.  I did.  Oh!  Bop.  Oh, no.  Dice is a politically incorrect joke for yesterday. 
[02:42:00]  We're going to hear bop in our sleep now.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I bop, you bop, and a bop, we bop.  Um, bop.  Um, bop.  Um, bop.  Um, bop.  Um, bop.  In the stoop.  Hey, Chris, go.  Hey, I learned that one American virgin.  Yes.  That's what Psycho Mark called him today.  All right.  And finally, Todd, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, I learned that, uh, Opie and Anthony have little or no rhyming ability at all. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  That happened.  If I ever write a song, you guys won't write it for me.  I'll write it myself.  Thanks.  All right, Todd.  Thank you.  See you.  I learned Pauly Shore is starring in The Adventures of Buick LeSabre.  That's good.  We got to get out of here.  Yeah.  Another, uh, we want to thank Paul for stopping by.  It's always a pleasure.  He's going to be at Bananas this weekend.  With, uh, Dom.  Yes.  Yeah.  Another funny man.  Saturday night, Dom's going to be there, so it'll be great.  So if you're looking for a little distraction, that's a direction you could head. 
[02:43:00]  You'll definitely have a good time.  Okay?  Thanks.  Tell John Stewart we said hi.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Thanks for having a lot of fun.  And, uh, guys, you know what we're trying to do.  We're just trying to distract you a little bit.  A few chuckles.  Yeah.  A few chuckles here and there.  And I hope we did that today for you.  Awesome chuckles.  Chuckles.  Chuckles.  Boy, I could go for some Italian, uh, food.  Ah!  Why don't you come here?  Have the best pasta in the world.  Do you have cannoli?  Yes, cannoli.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you guys Monday at 3.  Cheers. 
[02:43:30]  Hello.  Hope you had that.  I mean, one is funny.  You want a sis?  I hated my grandma.  Bitch.  Precious this.  The Opie and Anthony Show. </pre>
