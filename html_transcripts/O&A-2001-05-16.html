<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a protracted segment focusing on intern Brian, who arrived at work with a dramatic bandage and eye patch, claiming a motorcycle accident.  His inconsistent story, lack of specifics, and past absences fueled suspicion among the hosts and staff.  Despite initially refusing to remove the bandage, citing glass in his eye and doctor's orders, Brian eventually confessed to fabricating the injury.  The bandage and patch were removed, revealing no injuries.  The segment involved numerous listener calls, including one claiming to know Brian's doctor. A listener vote determined Brian would remain, but under continued scrutiny, notably forced to keep wearing the eye patch.  The hosts expressed amusement and frustration.


The fallout from Brian’s deception dominated further discussion, provoking heated debates about his potential dismissal and the breach of trust.  Opie and Anthony utilized the situation for comedic effect, employing mocking and insults.  Multiple calls advocated for Brian’s immediate dismissal.


The show then transitioned to a game where guest Brittany attempted to guess the profession of guest Jay Moore.  Brittany initially believed him to be an intern, leading to humorous misunderstandings.  The reveal of Jay as an actor (with credits including *Jerry Maguire*) provided a comedic conclusion to this segment.


Following this,  the show returned to the Brian saga with additional listener calls, followed by listener calls sharing military anecdotes filled with offensive language targeting various nationalities.  The hosts then mentioned their upcoming Hard Rock Cafe appearance.


A subsequent segment featured a discussion between Opie, Anthony, and producer Spaz (Kevin), who expressed a desire for a closer personal relationship outside of work.  The hosts playfully teased this request. The conversation explored differences in male and female friendships and the awkwardness of forcing a friendship. Reggie, another show employee,  phoned in to speculate on Spaz's motives.  This led to discussion of Spaz's book, his recent birthday (and a listener’s positive review of a birthday card Spaz sent), a past charity event where they were hit with golf balls in hockey gear, difficulties donating to charities (including a story about their general manager, Bruce Mittman, using a derogatory term for the recipients of their donation to the Minority Homeless Veterans Association of Boston), and the fallout from a past on-air segment, "Hi, Mom, I'm Gay," including a playback of the segment and discussion of a subsequent meeting with a gay rights organization and Bruce Mittman's reactions. Chara briefly commented on receiving a birthday card from Spaz.


The broadcast concluded with a recounting of an April Fool's prank gone wrong involving the fabrication of Boston Mayor Menino's death.  The prank resulted in significant backlash and threatened their jobs.  Bruce Mittman ("the midget") attempted damage control, secretly arranging a photo opportunity with the mayor.  Dada Dave devised a further appeasement plan:  Opie and Anthony would be placed in stocks and have pies thrown at them.  Dave ordered 500 pies without consulting them.  Opie and Anthony refused, leading to Dave's anger and a PR strategy backfire.  A revised plan involved taking the pies to a children's cancer hospital.  Upon realizing the children were terminally ill, including a child on life support, Opie and Anthony felt the situation was exploitative, left the pies, and ultimately viewed their subsequent firing as a positive outcome.  The segment contained frequent homophobic slurs and other offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey guys, what's up? It's Opie. We got f***ed. We're in court.  So I hope you're enjoying this worst of crap. Trust me, we're not happy. We're not here.  We'll be back on the radio tomorrow.  Also want to remind you guys, we're going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe after tomorrow's show. 
[00:00:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:00]  The patch on his forehead, a huge bandage.  And he swears that he was in what, a car accident?  Car accident. A motorcyclist, I guess, hit him.  R, maybe, R.  We'll think he's like faking.  Now there's been some speculation as to the validity of your injuries.  Everyone was speculating during the day that I'm wondering if it's real.  Because some people have looked under the patch.  I have not looked under the patch and said there's nothing wrong with the story. 
[00:01:30]  What happened to you?  Yeah, what happened?  He got hit by a motorcycle.  You look completely ridiculous.  You got hit by a motorcycle.  Yeah.  But not you personally, your car.  My car.  Okay, so you're driving.  Driving me from the left-hand turn.  You're making a left.  And the motorcycle decides I'm going left in there.  He decides to do what?  To pass on my left.  Oh, to pass on your left.  Yeah.  So you're making a left, he's passing you on the left, and he runs into what?  My driver's side.  Your driver's side door.  So what happened?  Wait.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  My head goes through my driver's side window. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, it did?  Yes.  How fast did he go?  I don't know.  22 miles an hour.  Mm-hmm.  And you're making your left?  Yes.  And he hits your door, your head goes through the window?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Yes.  So you hit your head, and what happened to your eye?  Uh, glass got in it.  Glass in your eye.  And what happened underneath that patch on your head?  Uh, that's, that's where my head went through the windshield.  What kind of injury, uh...  Just, just, just a couple scrapes.  Couple of scrapes.  Yeah, sort of hard head.  Anything, any, uh, hospital?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  You went to the hospital?  Did they stitch your head up or anything?  I stitched my head up a little bit.  Uh, washed out my eye.  Washed out your eye.  Why the patch?  Because, uh...  Arr.  I can't really...  Arr.  I can't really open up my eye, so...  You can't open it?  No, not, not well, because it's, uh, glass in the eye.  Kind of hurts, huh?  Yeah, a little bit.  Can we look at the, uh, scratches on your head?  You got to see them.  No, I really can't take it off.  You can't take it off.  I don't know why I did.  What?  Okay, no, no, I'm still...  Look, I'm still willing to believe this. 
[00:03:00]  I'm still willing to believe this.  I'm still willing to believe this.  I need a patient over there.  You, so, you, you, you got scratches, but they had to be stitched.  How many stitches did you get?  Three stitches.  All on one cut, or two on one cut?  All in one cut.  All in one cut, three stitches.  Is there any way to lift it up to take a look underneath?  If you really, I'd rather not.  I mean...  All right, Ben, Ben, for you.  I'm trying to take it off out there and rub your eye.  Well, you were...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The bandage on his head. 
[00:03:30]  Well, lift up the patch of it.  Yeah, let's look at the eye.  I really can't open up...  I've shown Rick before, I really can't open up my...  I always do.  You just, you can't really...  He's blinking that, that eye's blinking a lot.  I have a question.  Yeah.  All right, Rick, to you.  You said you had glass in your eye.  Yes.  How come you were rubbing your eye before if there's glass?  Because it bugs the hell out of me.  Oh.  Didn't they get all the glass out?  Yeah, they did, but it scratches.  It scratches the whole eye.  Scratches, huh?  Scratches in your eye.  Yeah.  Well, that happens. 
[00:04:00]  The cornea gets scratched open.  Yes.  And it takes time to heal.  And that's the only injuries you had was the glass in the eye and the stitches above your patch?  Yeah.  Yeah, my driver's the window shattered.  Let's see the stitches.  I really can't.  I'll come in.  The next time I'm here, I'll show you the scar.  You know, it would be totally...  No, don't do it, Steve.  You know, it would be...  I'm covering my head now.  It's going to hurt.  You know something?  Wait, we've all had stitches.  You can take the...  My doctor told me not to.  I don't want to get infected. 
[00:04:30]  I swear...  No, I'll cover my head now because I don't want to put anybody in the studio.  No, no.  Don't worry.  No one's going to pull it off.  No, no.  Really.  No one pull it off.  But the thing is, this would totally be resolved just if we saw suspicious.  Because I must say, everyone has been talking behind your back saying that you're faking it.  It is very suspicious.  Now, Rick, was there something behind, like, I heard a story that he couldn't make it in one day.  He couldn't make it in.  Well, last week he never made it in on Monday, which was the snow day, saying that, you know,  the trains weren't running. 
[00:05:00]  Well, that's fine, but...  But, you know what?  Monday wasn't that bad and trains were running.  I didn't say the trains weren't running.  I couldn't get to the train station, but...  What hospital was there?  Northern Westchester.  Northern Westchester.  Okay.  Emergency...  I mean, I feel like...  All right.  What?  What?  Like an idiot.  No, no.  Don't ever feel like an idiot.  Everyone's looking at me really funny.  Well, just take the patch off.  Show us the stitches and then we all look like idiots.  But I really would rather not because...  I will show you the scar.  No, because you might cut yourself and get sick. 
[00:05:30]  No, I didn't.  I'm empathetic.  Thank you.  When he first came in, he said he didn't want to take the patch off because he still has  glass in it.  Right.  Well, I think there probably is...  That's what he said to me.  Is there glass in it?  This is a little weird, man.  I'm telling you.  You were rubbing your eye.  Because it's issues because of the strap.  I think this kid came in with a fake injury, man.  No, come on.  No, I'm still...  I totally am willing to believe you.  How about we all put...  Now, here's a little more of what happened last week.  All right, Rick.  Wednesday, he was supposed to be in.  Yes.  I never got a phone call. 
[00:06:00]  He knows my number.  He's left me messages before.  Well, Rick, come on.  Nothing...  I don't like calling you either.  No.  When was this accident?  It was at my hometown.  Where?  I went Wednesday.  My car...  And that's why you didn't call Rick?  Yeah, it really was.  But how come you found the time to call Steve?  All right, hold on.  No, AJ from the other show.  Here we go.  You guys are willing to listen to me.  All right, let's...  I'm just trying to figure this out because...  I understand.  Do you get me?  It sounds a little...  All you have to do is pull down the bandage. 
[00:06:30]  I will show you...  And then we look like tools.  All right.  On...  Oh, my...  Wednesday.  We've all had stitches.  All you have to do is go like this.  Show the edge of the stitch and boom.  What's going to happen?  I'll show you on Wednesday.  This is when we come on to Wednesday.  All right, let him talk.  Now, what happened?  My car...  Steve, you got something on this?  No, I'll let him tell his story.  Your car?  My car...  I left a dome light on in my car so my car didn't start because the battery was dead.  Okay.  And when I got it jumped, I was on the way to the station.  That's...  I called when I found out my car was dead.  Okay. 
[00:07:00]  And then on the way to the station...  What did you call?  I accidentally called Steve.  And your whole head went through the windshield?  No, the side window.  The side window.  Because the motorcycle hit him on the side, so it threw his head through the side window.  What was the name of the guy on the motorcycle?  We can't give out memes like that.  Well, we can always dump it out.  Ben?  Well, you know what I love about this, too, is that he can't find to call any of us.  And I love the excuse that our interns all of a sudden have.  I don't know the number.  I'm actually going to be in defense of this, too, because I really... 
[00:07:30]  I have trouble calling because I don't know anyone...  But Obi's number.  But, Ant, we fixed that problem weeks ago.  We all gave him phone numbers and said, this is the...  You've got to call us.  Mike has a good point.  And I've been hearing from Jeff.  All right, all right.  All right, that's boring.  But Mike has a good point on line nine.  And, uh, well, let me...  We'll go to Mike.  All right.  Mike, what's up?  It's WNAW.  Dude.  Hey.  What happened to the dude on the motorcycle?  And why was he out on Wednesday in the snow and the rain on a motorcycle?  It makes no sense.  It wasn't raining and sunny on Wednesday. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  It was crappy out Wednesday.  It really wasn't.  All right.  What happened to the guy on the bike?  Yeah, what happened to the guy on the bike?  He really just...  His...  My car was more destroyed than his.  But what happened to him?  Wait, the guy had to go flying.  He really didn't.  We weren't going that fast.  But wait, what happened to him?  He came from...  He was just kind of...  And he left?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, he...  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I have an accident report.  I'll break it.  Hold on.  If you guys...  Wait, you have an accident report, too?  That's fake, too? 
[00:08:30]  Yes, that's fake.  Wow.  I know people have fake.  If you guys will...  I think it's a plot for airtime.  It's working.  Let me tell you.  It's working.  Now, he hit the door.  It was enough for...  Let me just get this straight.  It's enough force to physically move the vehicle enough that your head...  It moved your car enough.  Yes.  Because in order for your head to go through the driver's side window,  your car has to move to put your head through the window. 
[00:09:00]  It's not your head that moves.  When your head goes through anything, it is the actual vehicle moving into your head.  So, he hits your car with enough force to move the vehicle so your head goes through the window.  Yes.  Basic physics.  But nothing happens, and he rides his motorcycle away?  Swear to God.  I have an accident report.  Oh, Brandon, it's not fake.  It's nothing...  Is your car here?  No.  How did you get here?  Train.  How did you get to the train station?  Car.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, listen. 
[00:09:30]  Hey.  This guy is so full of it, he doesn't want to show you the stitches because he doesn't have any.  I know.  There's no reason now.  I work in the emergency room.  There's no reason now why he can't show you those stitches if he has them.  Hmm.  And that's like a...  Where did you get that bandage?  Out of your face.  Plain reed right around the corner.  I can't hear you.  You have to believe me.  It's barely on your forehead.  With this one, this one's a straight one.  It's kind of popping off.  We might be able to even look underneath.  And will you agree that maybe you might see some swelling in that area? 
[00:10:00]  You can't tell because the bandage is huge.  But even around his eye.  Jerry.  How his head went.  Hey, Jerry.  Hi.  Yay.  I just got into a car accident and I got 50 stitches across my eyelids and they didn't  put any bandages on me.  No, it's not on his eyelids.  Oh, no, because...  No, he's got...  This is what he's got.  He's got a patch over his eye because he had a little glass in there and he scratched up  his eye, even though you can't really tell when he lifted up the patch.  And then he has a bandage above the eye where he has some stitches. 
[00:10:30]  A bandage is above the eye.  What make motorcycle is this, sir?  Well, put it this way.  I just received 50 stitches.  It was a Honda.  No one drives a Honda.  It was a...  I drive a Honda.  People drive the Honda.  People drive the Honda.  It was a Honda and he hits the door.  What did he say to you after he hit you?  Are you okay?  Are you okay?  And then he took off.  No.  I mean, he waited around for the police.  He waited for the cops.  All right.  All right.  That's why I have a police report, which I will bring to you next time I'm here.  See you guys. 
[00:11:00]  All you have to do is show us the bandage.  I don't...  Everyone is like...  Rachel.  Okay.  Yeah.  What's up?  People's heads don't go through driver's side windows.  Well, no.  It can happen.  It can happen.  How can a motorcycle driver drive away if it hit him with enough impact to make his head...  Well, that's what I'm saying.  A lot more damage would be done to the guy.  And he turned his head so it was head-on.  Don't buy it.  No way.  All right.  I got something for him. 
[00:11:30]  Okay.  It looks like you have nice, poofy, shampooed hair.  Did you take a shower recently?  I washed my head.  I didn't take a shower.  Did it take off the bandage?  No.  I was told not too much.  I'm scared.  That's a dry bandage.  But it's not wet.  It's not wet.  It's soggy.  It would be all messy.  I washed my hair.  That is a brand new bandage.  But wouldn't it come off if it got wet a little?  It hasn't yet.  How could you keep it from getting wet washing your hair?  Because it's very good question, Opie.  Thank you.  Okay, you're right.  Detective Opie.  Let's see.  Take the bandage. 
[00:12:00]  No, I don't want to take that bandage.  You've got to take that bandage.  I mean, and considering how much he's touching it and pushing on it, it doesn't work.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  Hi, Brian.  Hi, Anne-Marie.  Hi.  Hey, what happened to him?  Well, I don't know about the accident because I wasn't working whenever he got in the accident.  But I can tell you, he's very accident-prone.  Hang up, Anne-Marie.  Hang up the phone.  Why not?  What's the matter, Brian?  Keep her on the phone.  I work with her.  Trying to figure this out. 
[00:12:30]  What do you mean he's accident-prone?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, fine.  Tell them about the incident.  The other incident.  How many incidents have you had, Brian?  Oh, my God.  We're on to something.  Tell them about the hot boiling water on my crotch.  He can tell them that.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, that's right.  He can tell them that.  He's a regular over at the Hudson Valley Hospital.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He's like, he falls.  Well, you know, like, a lot of people can fall down the stairs, but Brian can actually fall up the stairs and get hurt. 
[00:13:00]  Like that Munchausen by proxy syndrome.  Only without a child, he just does it to himself.  All right, hold on, Anne-Marie.  For the attention.  You do that?  What town was this in?  Uh, Yorktown.  I live in Yorktown, yeah.  Yorktown.  Okay.  Uh, Bill, you work in Yorktown?  No, no, no.  I live in Yorktown.  But listen.  Okay.  I got a friend that's a state trooper.  Yeah.  Was it the state trooper that helped this kid?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a friend that's a state trooper.  He would have told me.  He just came on a motorcycle to see me.  He would have told me if there was a motorcycle accident. 
[00:13:30]  Besides, there's so much sand on the roads, especially right after the blizzard,  there was no way that anybody's driving a motorcycle around here because you'd be dead.  I've seen people drive a motorcycle.  I have the police report, I swear to you.  I'll bring it in next time I see you.  All you have to do is take the bandage off.  I don't know what...  What police department?  Like, what area?  Is there any way we can call right now and verify that there was an accident?  What road did it happen on?  Yeah, what road was it?  What road was it?  It was in Pleasantville.  What road?  What road? 
[00:14:00]  Pleasantville Road.  Dude, you came to work making an accident, man.  Dude, hold on.  Maybe I'm embellishing it a little bit.  That's scary.  You're embellishing a little bit.  All right, now we're getting on to it.  What is embellishing a little bit?  We work with a bunch of...  What's embellishing a little bit?  How much is embellished?  Be honest.  No, I really got hit by a motorcycle, Mike.  Maybe my head didn't go through the window.  Was this last...  All right.  Maybe the head didn't go through the window.  So it hit the window.  No, well, I think... 
[00:14:30]  So there's no glass in your eye.  There is glass.  From where?  What broke?  No, my window did break.  But my head and my nod went through the window.  It might have been his...  Wait, let me...  Mike.  Mike, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I just can't water glass for a living.  Yeah.  All right?  It takes almost a hammer to go through a side window.  They're not meant to break.  Right.  This guy must have got creamed if he could have even come close to get his head through a  side window.  So you're saying maybe it was the guy?  The motorcycle guy's helmet?  Maybe it was...  From across the car?  But he just drove away?  No.  He was fine. 
[00:15:00]  I have the accident report.  I'll give you the guy's number when I get home.  I'll call you.  So then what...  If your head didn't go through, what's on your head?  It was the glass shattered onto my head.  Okay.  All right.  It hits.  Glass shatters on your head.  And it is enough to...  Oh, lift it up.  Lift it up.  Lift it up.  You've got to lift that damn thing up.  You've got to...  I'm dying to see this now.  Lift.  It's got to be...  I really don't want to.  I can't do that.  I'm feeling really...  That's the purpose here.  We're trying to...  We're working this out.  We're working with...  We're working with single white male. 
[00:15:30]  We're working through this.  You're effing freak.  Keith, the cop.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We're trying to recreate the accident scene here.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's a cop.  Here's a cop that's been on many...  Yes.  Details.  I've seen many accidents.  So what you're saying is you're in the left-hand lane attempting to make a left-hand turn?  No.  I'm in my right lane making a left-hand turn.  Making a left...  It's a legal turn.  Okay.  Wait, you're making an illegal turn there?  No, no.  It's legal.  Are you in the turning lane? 
[00:16:00]  You're going left.  It's a one-way street.  One lane.  I mean, not one lane.  I'm sorry.  One lane each direction.  Yeah.  Okay.  So it doesn't matter left or right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Pleasantville Road.  What university is there?  Quickly.  Quickly.  Each university.  Okay.  All right.  University.  Pleasantville Road.  And you're at an intersection.  What road are you turning on to?  This is a familiar route because you're on your way to work.  I was on your way to work and school and all that.  You take this every day.  So Pleasantville, you make a left on...  Manville.  Manville.  Manville.  Okay. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  Approximately how far back is the motorcycle when you make the turn?  Probably like 20 feet.  And he passes you over the double yellow.  I think what might have happened was that his foot...  What he said was his foot slipped off the brake pedal and he kept going into my car.  His foot slipped off the brake pedal.  He didn't use the hand pedal.  Doesn't use that front brake.  So his foot slipped and he went in.  So it was just...  So he's almost like next to you.  Yeah.  And he builds up enough speed to fly into your car and even shatter a window and fly off his 
[00:17:00]  motorcycle so his helmet hits the window.  On any cut under that bandage.  Okay.  You don't, do you?  No.  Okay.  My...  Yes, Scott.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I'm going to...  What is it?  It's a scratch.  It's a scratch.  Yes, I'm going to embellish a little bit.  So you embellish with the stitcher.  Then you can take it off.  Hey, it's a cut.  Did you indeed go to the hospital?  Yes, I did.  Take off the bandage.  You can take it off.  It's embarrassing because it's likely to get anything there. 
[00:17:30]  Don't even be embarrassed.  Just take...  Can you see a cut on my finger, too, if you really want to?  You can redeem yourself, but just be honest and take the bandage off.  We'll laugh at you and then we'll move on.  We'll laugh and we'll move on.  Let's go.  I want to see a cut on my finger.  Take the bandage off.  Just the bandage on your finger.  Just the one on your head.  Take the bandage off.  You've got to take it off now.  Here it comes.  It's going to hurt.  Let's take it off.  Let's take...  You see that?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Turn your head.  I am scared for my finger.  Dude, I was honestly expecting maybe a cut. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, at least a little cut.  A little cut.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  I mean nothing there.  There's nothing there.  Dude, there is nothing there.  Holy ass.  There's absolutely nothing there.  I am scared for my finger.  People, I can't stress you enough.  Like not even...  There's not even an abrasion.  There's nothing under that.  I saw...  It went from three stitches to a head going to the window and there's nothing under there.  Because that is skin.  That is skin on the same side of each... 
[00:18:30]  It does not look any different.  There is not even any swelling or anything.  Dude, there's nothing.  Nothing hit...  I have a piece of work.  Okay.  Was it Earl's Friendly's video game on the motorcycle?  Was that it?  Earl's Friendly's video game on the motorcycle?  Now let's go phase two.  Dude, take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  You don't need the patch.  Take the patch off.  Open your eye.  No, I really can't open my eye.  Open your eye.  That is true.  It's not tearing.  It's not red.  It's not red.  The whites of your eye are white.  I can't even open my eye. 
[00:19:00]  How many fingers?  I can see...  Not in my right eye.  I can see five.  Close your right eye.  Open the other eye.  I can't.  Open the other eye.  Open the goddamn eye.  There's nothing wrong with your eye.  Please don't do this anymore.  I swear.  You're scaring eyes.  Open your stupid eye.  Open the eye.  Open the eye.  Single white male.  Open the eye.  There's nothing wrong with it.  You have nothing on your eye.  I swear to you there's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing on your forehead.  You had a huge patch.  There's nothing on your eye. 
[00:19:30]  You're saying you couldn't even take the patch off the shower.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Holy S.  That is the best.  All right.  It's opening up.  Yeah, it's opening up a little bit.  All right.  I swear if you guys...  It's opening.  Yeah.  All right.  Open it up.  You embellished about the eye.  Open it.  No.  Pull the bottom lid down a little.  That really does hurt.  Well, pull it down.  I just want to see if it's red.  Pull the bottom lid down.  Now, open the other eye.  I can't open up my eye.  Hold it open.  That really does hurt.  Take the pain.  Hold it open a little. 
[00:20:00]  Hold your eye open.  I want to see if there's any irritate...  Look, it's totally white.  Dude, do you see any red?  I swear to God.  It looks like his other eye.  There's no red.  There's nothing wrong with you.  I mean, there are a little bloodshot, but his other eye is bloodshot, too.  There's nothing wrong with you.  But please wear the patch.  Feel free to wear the patch.  Where's my parrot?  Please feel free to wear the patch.  All right.  Look at how he's freaking out over here. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, and what...  Who the hell screams these people?  Not only that...  What's up, bud, man?  Brian is a little weird.  Do you remember the first couple days you showed up to work, he, like, brought in pies  and was buying us coffee and was just...  Well, that's nice.  You want to make a good impression.  I'm not going to delve off into any other directions here that don't have any validity  with this case that we're working on right here, the injury case.  The injury case.  I still got to know, did you embellish with the motorcycle gun?  No.  I have the police report. 
[00:21:00]  I will bring it in.  All right.  We are looking forward to seeing the police report.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for the frigging half-hour radio.  Steve, you're not going home early today, are you?  No.  Okay, good.  Not at all.  Steve, we've got to get at least a still picture of the unveiling of the police.  Okay, what were you working on before we pulled you in?  Nothing.  Nothing?  I'm checking out his feedback. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  Okay, great.  We'll let you continue ahead on your job.  All right.  You can wear the patch if your eyes are hurting a little bit.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  That was great.  Take your bandage with you.  We don't want to get any infections from all the blood on there.  That is great.  What's the matter?  Nothing.  I'm a little hurt.  You're a little hurt.  I feel like an ass.  Well, you know something?  Open your eye.  And then we can, like, move on.  You're still, like, faking that you can't open the eye. 
[00:22:00]  The thing is, I understand you feel like an ass, but when you do certain things and they  don't pan out and there's consequences, the one consequence is looking like an ass.  Yeah.  So you did this, now you move on and you learn.  That may be embellishing when things happen.  You said you had stitches.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Nothing at all.  Next time, you fake a knee injury, you wrap it up in an eighth bandage, no one could call  you on it.  You just say, it hurt.  I hurt my leg.  But a head wound is like, wow, that's a tough one because it's right there.  And the patch, you know something? 
[00:22:30]  If you adjust the head wound, maybe that way, but then you add the patch, it's a little  much.  Okay.  A little much.  We might have believed if you just had the patch or the bandage.  Not both, though.  The bolt would put it over the top.  But next time, a leg injury, back injury, something you can't really say, take the bandage  off.  Jay, dude, stop talking to this guy.  Call security.  Hide behind something.  You'll never see your freaking accident report.  He's lying.  He's a psycho, bro.  All right? 
[00:23:00]  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait.  He says he feels like an ass.  That's because he's busted.  Now he's about to strike.  You're not going to strike, are you?  I have a hand.  All right.  Can we check his clothes and stuff?  For real.  You're not going to go crazy, are you?  Oh, he is, man.  Get rid of him.  Do you want any guns?  No guns.  Do you have any guns on you?  No.  Do you have any needles in your pocket?  Okay, let's frisk them over.  I'm not going to get stuck in here, am I?  Can we check his clothes for weapons?  I don't think he's carrying any weapons open. 
[00:23:30]  You thought he had stitches.  No, we didn't think he had stitches.  But, you know, I would think he was just trying to garner a little sympathy.  Are you the man of a thousand faces?  Excuse for the day off.  All right.  We can move on now.  All right.  Thank you very much.  You can go back to or whatever.  And don't feel too bad, you know.  You pay, you know.  You do something.  It doesn't pan out.  You pay.  Now you'll forever be the eyepatch guy.  What good message board name could it be? 
[00:24:00]  Captain Psycho.  Captain Psycho.  I'm honored.  All right.  All right.  Well, continue with looking at instant feedback.  Thank you.  You're good on.  You can turn around and there you go.  There you go.  There he goes.  Out the door.  Watch.  Don't hit your head with the door.  That would hurt.  Lock that studio door.  Holy S.  Where the hell are you finding these people?  That was great. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, guys.  What's up?  It's Opie.  We got f***ed.  We're in court.  So I hope you're enjoying this worst of crap.  Trust me.  We're not happy.  We're not here.  We'll be back on the radio tomorrow.  Also want to remind you guys, we're going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe after tomorrow's show.  Right after the show at 7 on 57th between, what, 7th and Broadway, Ben?  Yes.  Hey, Ben's still here.  He has to run the board.  Sucker.  See you guys tomorrow.  We'll see you at the Hard Rock tomorrow night, all right?  Peace.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Wow.  It's another WOW sticker stop. 
[00:25:00]  Black Earl will be at Sipperstein's Route 46 West.  Load.  I need your stickers.  These are booze.  From 1027.  WNEW.  All the news you need to know.  And boom.  This is WOW, the WOW radio station.  WNEW.  Yeah, it's the ONA show.  212-757-1027.  You know, you've got to get Stinky in here. 
[00:25:30]  I'm proud of Stink.  He's becoming more and more honest as he continues working on our radio show.  He was, Stinky was a little, uh, what, shy?  Shy at first.  Wouldn't really speak his mind, but he has changed.  Stink?  One of our favorite smartasses back in the office after the show.  Stink, what are you feeling right now with this kid?  I hate him.  I don't want to see him.  Oh, wow.  He lied to me, like, constantly the whole day before the show. 
[00:26:00]  Really?  I was asking him, you know, what happened?  Oh, I got stitches.  I can't show them.  My eyes got glass in it.  It's like, you know, what am I going to do?  A little scary.  And you're a little, like, uncomfortable now.  Yeah, I don't want to talk to him.  So you guys are like, I'm uncomfortable.  Yeah, you've got to be a little sympathetic, I'll be.  I mean, there's a reason that he's doing this, you know.  So I'm not out here to save the world and stuff, but I kind of know there's some kind  of reason that it's going on.  Anthony.  Yeah.  There was a reason why Joel Riskin did what he did. 
[00:26:30]  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying I'm not getting behind him.  There was a reason why that kid shot up the school in San Diego.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And it was because when he lied one time or something, people just jumped on him, maybe.  Yeah.  People are tuning in halfway through and going, what the hell is going on?  It went from an A-team type crash.  Why don't you explain really fast?  Summarize.  I know. 
[00:27:00]  Summarize what happened.  Well, Opie, our intern came in today.  Yeah, he...  What's his name?  Brian.  It's Brian.  He came in.  He had a big bandage on his forehead.  Huge.  Huge.  Yeah, very big bandage.  It took up half his forehead.  On his forehead.  And an eye patch over the left eye, his left eye.  Claiming he had it in an accident with a car and a motorcycle.  He was making a left.  So he went out to get coffee or something.  And we all started whispering in the back office. 
[00:27:30]  We're like, holy yes, the guy's shaking.  It just didn't seem...  Didn't add up.  Didn't add up.  He was trying to get off of work, I think, or an excuse for not coming in.  Because he didn't show up Wednesday.  Is that it, Rick?  Didn't show up Monday or Wednesday.  Didn't hear from him at all.  Yeah.  So basically...  And Rick's just a prick to work for.  So he, like, really rags these guys.  Basically, he should be fired.  But he had an excuse.  And the excuse was that he was in this accident.  Yeah, he...  Hence the patch on his eye and the big, huge bandage on the forehead.  And the big bandage on his head. 
[00:28:00]  And people were calling him on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, in the office.  We were talking.  And then we decided we'll just go on the air and hash it out.  Well, he comes in and says...  He was making a left.  The motorcycle was going straight around him.  They crashed.  His head went through the driver's side window.  Cutting his head.  Requiring three stitches in the ER, Opie.  And he had glass in his eye, which scratched the cornea.  And that's what the eye patch was for.  After some questioning about some things that didn't quite pan out... 
[00:28:30]  Everyone is scared now.  Look at everyone's face.  It might have been embellishing.  Don't look at the last side.  Everyone's in the studio.  He might have been embellishing.  He's the only one outside the studio now.  And that door's locked.  Breathe down.  So he said he might have been embellishing the story.  Who comes up with this crap?  He wouldn't take the bandage off his eye, off his head, off his forehead.  He wouldn't take the bandage off.  No one's going outside.  No.  So no work's being done.  He said he didn't want to get infected. 
[00:29:00]  He was lying right there standing in front of us, saying,  I can't take it off.  It'll get infected.  My doctor said no.  My doctor said no.  When we finally did get him to take the bandage off, because he said he was embellishing,  and his head did not go through the window,  it just some glass broke from the motorcycle guy's helmet hitting the window,  or whatever, he got cut.  We wanted to see the cut.  He finally said he was embellishing, took the bandage off.  Opie, there was not even a ding.  There wasn't a scratch where if you scratched yourself on your head because you had an itch, 
[00:29:30]  there wasn't even that red that you had.  I have more of a mark on my face, you probably noticed today, from a washcloth,  because I scrubbed too hard.  Look, over here, he doesn't even have that on his forehead.  You get more marks just from shaving.  I can't stress to how much of a mark there was nothing.  And then the eye patch comes off.  He was blinking real hard with that eye, saying that there was glass in it,  even though there wasn't glass.  But the eye started loosening up, and he pulled down the bottom of the eye, 
[00:30:00]  and there was no red at all, no red in the eye.  So, obviously, he made up the story because he missed Monday and Wednesday,  and now no one wants to leave the studio to work.  It was a story.  Let's go back to Anne-Marie.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  How are you doing?  All right.  Well, I can tell you that Brian probably, when he gets hurt, see what happens is, 
[00:30:30]  he's kind of afraid that it's going to be worse than it really is.  Anne-Marie, he wasn't hurt at all.  Oh, but I bet you he thinks he was.  I wouldn't put it past him.  I bet you he poked himself in the eye a couple times before he came to work.  No, he didn't do it on purpose, but he gets, like, he's very tender.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, if he gets, like, a headache, you know, he's got a brain tumor.  Oh, like a hypochondriac kind of thing?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  But that's...  Yeah, and we call him Briar the Liar.  Oh, what do you call him?  Briar the Liar.  Well, because he exaggerates a lie?  Yeah, a little bit, yeah.  Jesse?  Yeah.  You remember when he said he had to take a day off because he had surgery on his head  or his brain?  No, it wasn't his head.  What?  What?  Something like that.  It was his foot?  Yeah.  He said his brain.  You're right.  He said he had surgery on his head.  Well, maybe his head is...  All right, let's go.  Get Briar.  Briar, what happened?  What happened when?  You had surgery? 
[00:31:30]  On my ankle, yes.  On your ankle?  Yes, that was true.  And that was true.  What happened?  I've got nothing I'm going to say.  Well, now you know what it is.  It's the boy that cried wolf thing.  You can't blame us now for not believing certain things.  Earl, stay in here.  Stay in here.  Get sticky in here.  Now, what happened to your leg?  To your ankle?  I tore my leg.  What happened?  I tore my leg.  I tore my leg.  I mean, it's playing basketball.  Playing basketball.  And you got an operation done.  It doesn't look like you're too active.  Do you have a scar on there? 
[00:32:00]  Is there an operation scar there?  Yeah.  On my knee.  All right, let's see.  He was playing basketball, Michael Jordan.  Brian, you...  All right.  Brian, you told me it was when you tripped.  I thought you said ankle.  I thought you just said ankle.  Wait, I thought you just said ankle.  You said ankle.  I did.  I'm just...  All right.  I don't see any surgical scars.  What do you mean?  Wait, where's the scar?  How long ago was this done?  My surgery scar was done a while ago.  But my knee...  But what's the recent one?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, guys.  When was this? 
[00:32:30]  When was this?  This is like...  A couple weeks ago.  Remember when...  Remember when you guys made a quick comment that someone tripped over the door?  He tripped over the door.  Oh, that was Brian.  I remember that.  And you said you came in and you said you had to have, like, your ankle...  You, like, tore a ligament.  I didn't tore a ligament from that.  What are you...  I don't even be writing you.  I don't want to see my...  I'm not trying to write...  Where is the surgery scar that you had from this recent operation that was two weeks ago?  It was, it was orthoscopic, so you're not going to really see it.  Where?  Oh, no.  We have no surgery scars over here. 
[00:33:00]  Wait a minute.  It was orthoscopic.  So...  What do you got?  A mole.  A mole!  It's a mole?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  It's not a mole.  Okay.  Now, Brian, haven't you also been going to physical therapy every Friday?  Yes.  I have the...  For what?  My ankle.  For the ankle.  Yeah.  So you have the orthoscopic surgery. 
[00:33:30]  So you have the mole on.  Yeah.  The mole.  And this therapy is where?  It's in...  Peekskill.  Sorry.  No, Peekskill.  Peekskill.  And what do they do to help you out?  Put me on different machines.  Although I'm not very active, as it'll be said.  They put me on machines that make me...  On machines?  Yes.  Because your ankle, what do they say is actually wrong?  I tore ligaments.  You tore ligaments?  Yes, a lot of them.  So now you, like, walk and do things, treadmill or something.  Yeah.  Threadmill, like, machines.  Okay. 
[00:34:00]  But there's no scar?  No.  That's amazing.  It's new, Serge.  All right.  Where's...  Bring Jesse in here.  Epilogical Brian's a new nickname.  Mark from LeBron.  Get everyone in here.  Get Sticky in here.  So, okay, you had that surgery.  Yeah.  But it was nothing with your brain or your head?  What was that, Jess?  You said...  See, Ben, I don't remember exactly, because it wasn't, like, a big deal, but you said you 
[00:34:30]  couldn't come in one Friday.  I don't mean...  I feel bad, because I'm like...  Oh, whatever.  That's cool.  You said you had, like...  You needed surgery on your head.  On your head?  No, no.  That was Rick making a joke at me.  He said I needed a lobotomy.  No.  Oh.  No, no.  You said it to me that you had head surgery.  I never said I had head surgery.  I'm just kidding.  Rick said that.  Brian, Brian, when you make a joke, that means it's not real.  All right.  Well...  Oh, my goodness.  I missed work one day.  All right.  Here's the deal.  There's a lot of people very uncomfortable right now, so we're going to have a little vote. 
[00:35:00]  What are you going to vote?  Who wants Brian to go home today?  Yeah.  What?  I'm not voting that.  You lied.  You lied with me.  Who cares?  I'm fine with it.  I don't care.  I think it makes for a great radio.  What, you want to toss a diamond in the rump like this out the door?  No.  I said go home today.  Today?  Yeah.  No.  I think he's doing a great job.  Thank you, I think.  Come on.  You're going to get more stories if we live.  This is great. 
[00:35:30]  Hands up.  Who wants him out today?  Today?  No.  I say I'll put my hand up, too.  Oh, you want to go home today?  Steve?  Take care of the eye?  You're cool.  Well, you're big, and you know how to handle yourself.  I don't know.  He's not going to...  There's only three people that want him to leave?  No, you're being honest.  Let's be honest.  Why don't we get out of the room?  I'm being honest.  I think it's fine.  I'll turn my back, and I'll put my hands against the wall if you guys want to leave.  All right.  Turn your back, because maybe someone doesn't want to see that. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, a secret ballad?  All right.  Who wants it to leave?  Yeah, look.  Four votes are going up right now.  Four and four.  I had mine up before.  Just been serious.  Earl?  It's to you.  The deciding vote.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No way.  The man that can't do anything right.  Earl's not going to vote him off the island.  That's his brother, man.  Earl still thinks he's a virgin.  Earl, I like you.  I can't believe you guys wanted to stay today. 
[00:36:30]  Why not?  I feel bad.  Screw feel bad.  I'm still an intern.  I didn't want you to vote me out.  Kids effed off.  Why did you do it?  Can we ask that?  We really have an answer to ask the why.  Why did you go through this elaborate accident scheme?  Intimidation.  What do you mean?  Everyone had a story on the show and you figured you needed one?  Yeah, sure.  No, I don't know.  What intimidation?  Wait, you are intimidated?  I'm intimidated by the show. 
[00:37:00]  You're intimidated?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you get into this?  Yeah.  Because it is a tie.  It's four that want him to go, four that want him to stay.  I'm telling you that we're going to the listeners.  I'm sorry.  I'm screwed.  Clear the phone lines.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two, four.  Okay, we've got nine phones ringing.  And that's what's going to decide it.  I still got a note.  Was there ever an accident?  Yes, there was.  Was it in the last calendar year?  Yes, it was.  Now I can't even believe that.  Now I can't believe it. 
[00:37:30]  I'm bringing the accident report.  I want to get it.  And I interrupted you.  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say.  You were saying you were good.  Oh, you're intimidated by the show.  Yes.  Now, why is, I'm sure anybody, yes, when you first came here, it was a little rough, a little intimidating.  Yeah.  All right.  And how did you deal with it?  I'm still dealing with it.  What are you guys talking about?  But you just come in, you do your job, you hang out, you get your barbs in where you can, you kind of, you mix it up with us.  No, like you just don't say any.  I would wait until you guys would talk to me.  And I didn't bring food. 
[00:38:00]  Okay.  But that was a nice gesture, my friend.  That was a nice gesture.  But now, how did you feel this was going to help you?  Because I felt like if I didn't come up with, if I didn't elaborate on my injuries, you guys wouldn't believe me.  Well, you put you over the top of that.  But why did you come up with the story at all?  It wasn't a story.  It really didn't.  I mean, what?  Oh, it's a story.  You don't have stitches.  Okay, that wasn't a story, but the accident was true.  Take the patch off your stupid eye. 
[00:38:30]  Take the patch off.  God.  I'm not going to play along now.  Take the patch off.  My eye really does bother me.  I really can't take all the patches.  His eye bothers him, old bitch.  You guys are all insane.  Don't.  I have a patch cornea.  If you shine a light in the person's eye, it kills.  Yeah.  You don't want to do that, do you know?  We're not shining a light in his eye.  We're starting the voting.  Okay?  The listeners will be fine.  I'm packing up as we speak.  Oh, Dave. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Have you heard the last hour of radio?  Yeah.  Okay, what do you think?  I think the guy's a pathological liar.  You've got to get rid of him.  A patho.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Take care.  One bell.  Stinky.  Make sure Stinky keeps track.  Okay.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike?  Mike.  I'm sorry, man.  This guy's crazy, but he's funny.  No.  That's what I'm saying.  All we want to know is should we send him home,  today, right now?  No, no.  This is really entertaining, man. 
[00:39:30]  I'm listening.  All right.  Stay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to another Mike.  Mike?  Keep him there because two words, Ted Kaczynski.  Thank you, Mike.  Have you been known to be violent at any time?  No.  I'm sorry, Tika.  Exactly.  And he's a liar.  That's what they said about Joel Rifkin.  No.  So you don't have any aggression or anything?  You guys are insane.  Well, everyone says that one day I might just, you know, snap up.  Oh, God.  Let's get people around.  You're insane, Anthony. 
[00:40:00]  And there's no gag anymore.  I can't believe you guys want him here after what we just heard.  Oh, wait.  Earl's raising his hand now.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter because you were a pussy when we needed you.  So now the listener's going to decide.  Troy.  Yeah.  Hey.  Keep the guy.  See, everybody.  F you all.  This is the V vote.  I love it.  F you all.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry.  Fire him.  He's a fairy.  Fire him?  Yeah, fairy.  He's a fairy. 
[00:40:30]  Fire him.  All right.  Okay.  We're running out of votes here.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, now I know why my instant feedback's never getting on the air anymore.  Fire his ass.  Fire his ass.  It's 3-3.  All right, guys.  Bye-bye.  Three votes to go.  Mark from the Bronx saying he should have used the Chewbacca defense quickly,  that it's just so ridiculous that you must have quit.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Dom.  Hey.  I say keep him.  I think he's got a fast Q on our hands.  F and B.  You guys suck.  No, that was a cheap.  Please, no, don't let him leave today. 
[00:41:00]  It's only 5 o'clock.  That leaves in two hours to come back with weapons.  Michael.  Hey, what do you think?  I think he should go.  All right.  He's like the guy at the ski rods with the fake cask.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  It comes down to the one final vote.  Here it is.  Don't let me down.  Wayne?  Yeah, that's me.  All right.  How you doing, O.A.?  You will decide Brian's fake.  Fake.  Honestly, I know his doctor before I vote.  What?  I know his doctor. 
[00:41:30]  You knew his doctor?  I know his doctor.  I can verify for it all.  Conflict of interest on the voting, but...  Oh, but it's Bones McCoy.  Bones McCoy.  Where's the other...  It reveals anything that's going to happen to him before he comes into work.  All right.  Everyone, Harry, Bonnie.  You just saved your ass.  All right.  Wayne, it's...  Keep the nut.  You...  Keep the nut.  Keep the nut.  You know...  Maybe put one of them security bracelets on him so you know where he is all the time.  Well, can I take off my patch now?  He stays.  Keep on your patch.  I mean, he got a stoker, Patty, then, you know, still around. 
[00:42:00]  So now you're going to admit that the patch is sinking.  You want to take it off now?  That was a joke.  I'm sorry.  Wayne, thank you.  You let me down, and I was going to give you something for voting him out.  You're going to give me something to vote him out?  No, now I can't.  You voted to keep him.  Brian, I'd appreciate it if you were going to look me in the eye.  Or even...  Don't even come 20 feet away from...  Don't even enter the studio for the rest of the show.  Okay.  This is the show?  Okay.  I can do that. 
[00:42:30]  And do not be in the office after the show's over.  Uh-oh.  Until I leave for the train.  It's like Michael Corleone in the train.  You're nuts.  Look at me.  You're dead to me.  Wow.  I'm going to pull you back out of the studio now.  This is...  You guys let me down, man.  What's the matter, O?  You don't like me?  You're saying you love the cycle factor.  Every time something happens, you go, I love the cycle factor.  We just got an hour of cycle factor.  Now it's like hit the street.  Oh, God. 
[00:43:00]  What?  There he comes.  What?  Come on.  What?  You don't find this very entertaining on a very psychotic level?  You don't have to deal with them.  Look at these guys.  Look at Stinky and Jeff.  They don't even want to go outside the studio now.  We're never going to talk to them again.  You're the talent, man.  You know?  You have the talent.  No, the problem is it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I wanted them to go.  And one mistake.  Then we went to all you guys.  It was four and four.  Then we go to the listeners. 
[00:43:30]  And the listeners let us down.  Or my side, anyway.  Ben, are you happy?  No.  This sucks.  Get him home.  You're a frigging freak.  Thank you.  That is mental.  That whole story we just heard is beyond cycle factor.  That's mental.  All right.  Send him home for the day.  We can't.  And then we will talk about it.  No, we can't.  Why?  We did it the fair way.  Oh, I know we did it the fair way.  I'll accept the results.  I'm just pissed. 
[00:44:00]  I'm pissed at the results, but I'll accept them.  Well, the voting should be whether he should be fired or not.  We don't need good radio that bad is all I'm going to say.  Look at this guy checking in.  Make him wear the patch as long as he still works in, no matter how long it is.  Like, he's always got to come in now with that patch.  If he doesn't, he goes home.  Yeah, tell him that.  No, I'm serious.  He's got to wear the patch always.  No, the day he shows up without the patch, I swear to God, you've got to send him right home.  No joke. 
[00:44:30]  Rick, go tell him.  No, that's got to come from Rick.  Rick hired the immunitarium.  Very good.  Michael from Kenton Falls.  He said that.  Tony, what's up?  Oh, before you start ripping on me, I agree you should have sent him home today.  I tried.  But, dude, this kid has got problems, bro.  And, dude, we've listened to your stories about your family.  Yeah.  Dude, my friend's pregnant wife works with your brother, Quinn.  You think yesterday here on Friday's show she didn't look at him in a different way?  Wait a minute. 
[00:45:00]  First of all, first of all.  Dude, I agree, bro.  You're also yelling at me.  I've never faked an injury.  I know you have.  No one in my family faked an injury for sympathy.  All right?  Bro, nobody's questioning your integrity, bro.  But this kid has got problems.  He needs a nap scheme.  Maybe a permanent one.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Not you, Ope.  The kid.  Oh, I heard you.  Dude, man.  I don't know, Ope.  Nice knowing you, bro.  This kid's going to whack you and stinky first. 
[00:45:30]  Later, dude.  All right, Tony.  Nice knowing you, brother.  Ah, Tuttle from New York.  Final test.  Does Brian like Huey Lewis and the news?  Look at my business card.  The color is bone.  Rob, what's going on?  Yo, fire his dumb ass.  You're calling stinky a rat, though?  No, because I thought the camera was answering the phone.  Oh.  Dude, stinky rocks, man.  Stinky rolls.  Yeah.  This makes him a stinky personal bitch.  All right.  They can do stupid things.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Rob. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Look, Steve, you're all uncomfortable.  No, this isn't going to wait.  He's got to go home today.  Oh, because...  No, because, like, Michael...  Here, Michael...  Now you're all uncomfortable.  Michael online, too.  Ope, change your diaper.  Opie.  Yeah.  What is your problem?  We're a grown man.  We're not...  Because the kid is effed up.  Opie.  Not even in a good way.  Not even in a way we could, like, exploit on the radio.  Who cares?  You can take him down, all right?  I saw you on XFL.  I mean, you're not some little small wimp.  Who cares? 
[00:46:30]  He definitely won't shoot me, buddy.  He doesn't have to bandage himself.  So what?  See, now Ann wants to send him home.  But you know what?  Ann, it's 50 words.  Keep him.  He's entertaining.  I'm just saying, if it's going to interfere with the show, then he's got to go home.  No, see, I'm not happy with the decision we made, but we made the decision.  I have to live with that.  Yeah, but you're fine.  Yeah, but you're crying about it.  Who cares?  Michael.  Keep him away.  Michael, you...  Stinky!  God, someone will back me up.  Stinky, talk to Michael.  Everyone is uncomfortable now. 
[00:47:00]  How are you going to look at this guy or, like, at the end of the show, go to the office  and sit down next to him?  Michael, Michael, the guy had a bandage on his forehead claiming he had three stitches.  After about an hour, he finally took the bandage off.  Guess what?  There wasn't even a scratch.  Isn't that a little mental?  Did he have a Jeffrey Dahmer look to him, or what?  Did he have one eye?  Did you see it?  I mean, come on.  You should be here whining about this for 20 minutes.  Move on.  All right, we'll move on.  Thank you.  Okay.  If I was him, I would leave on my own, out of embarrassment. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know what he's just doing.  He's just sitting there now.  I know.  He's just sitting there.  No one's talking to him.  He's afraid to come by the studio door, even.  Hey, don't go home.  What?  Don't go home.  Oh, you're not going to make me do that.  Oh, I will, but then the listeners will lash out at me.  Call me aside, baby.  It comes from you.  They'll go, okay, cool.  All right.  Tell them to go home.  I can't do that.  What am I? 
[00:48:00]  Tell them to go home.  Tell them to go home and not to go back.  Get out of here.  Come on.  That's not my job.  I don't hire and fire.  Well, that's Rick's job.  Rick should show some backbone.  Oh, see?  Come on.  You're pushing it off onto me.  Well, who's who's?  Hey, the name on the sign says Opie and Anthony, and you're Anthony.  Look.  Yeah, his name's first.  Look.  Oh, you're going to pull that. 
[00:48:30]  That's the first time you ever pulled out.  In this situation.  Just for the record, we've never played that before.  It works, though, in this situation.  Yeah, but you know we've never played that before.  Look, I already spelled out how I feel about this.  Look, if I'm not looked at as a crybaby, I'll do it right now.  No problem.  Oh, seriously.  Hank, what are you thinking?  He's at home.  What are you going to do anyway?  He can't do anything now.  He just has to sit there.  You know what?  I don't really care what people think of me. 
[00:49:00]  Get him in here.  Yeah, make sure he doesn't go in the studio.  Brian.  Yeah.  You're outside the studio about what?  He says 20 people.  Right.  That's what I asked you.  So for the first time, you're following rules.  The Opie restraining order.  Can we do the prison visit up?  Yeah, you want to do it that way?  Yeah, get him on the phone.  All right.  No, because then, no.  No, I can do it this way.  Brian, you're making a lot of people uncomfortable.  I can tell.  I'll leave you on the phone. 
[00:49:30]  That's okay.  I understand.  What?  What?  I understand.  You understand that?  Yeah.  We don't know if we want you back, though.  What?  I'm going to lie?  That was so tough.  Well.  Do you understand there has been a breach of faith here?  Don't you find it a little weird, the whole thing?  You're still wearing the patch, and you don't even have an eye injury.  You have an injury, though.  That's what you don't understand.  What's every injury?  You said you had an injury on your forehead.  There's not even a scratch.  My head was smashed apart, and I lost my shoes. 
[00:50:00]  So you're about 19 feet away.  Okay.  Yeah, move back.  Thank you.  God damn it.  You're awful.  I'm mean.  I'm mean.  The guy said...  No, I see what you're calling you.  What up, Jeff?  I don't know.  Both of you are 100% right.  What?  Stank, am I right?  You are.  Ben, am I right?  100%.  Thank you.  200%.  You're not going to ask me? 
[00:50:30]  I don't care.  I know you don't care.  That's all right.  These are good cookies.  Who wants them to come back?  Not everyone at once.  Wow.  That hurts.  How's it going to be different any day?  You know, tomorrow?  Well, I'll cry.  You're different.  Yeah, you're calling.  Is the injury going to be healed?  You're calling sick half the time anyway.  Is this going to crush you?  Not that much, but it will.  A little bit, because I like you guys.  Oh.  I mean, you can still look... 
[00:51:00]  It's hard to tell you here.  Oh.  I mean...  Be tough, be tough.  I'm talking to myself.  Would we have to worry about you coming back here and shooting everybody?  I don't like being blunt with this thing.  Now, is there anything that might happen?  Are you going to shoot everyone?  No, no, no.  No shooting going on.  Sam?  No.  You can still listen to us through the radio and stuff.  Let's see how things go.  You can step back a little bit.  Hello.  I think you just sound fine to me. 
[00:51:30]  I don't foresee any problem with him coming back.  So, Brian, why don't you...  You're not going to kill anybody, though, right?  No.  Nobody's going to be...  No threats, no threatening emails or anything?  Nothing at all.  What?  Nothing at all.  Nothing at all.  Did you sign something?  Yeah.  When you started working here?  Yeah.  Okay.  Brian, you're not to kill anybody?  Yeah, I didn't read the fine print, but I guess...  I think that was in there.  Brian, I'd feel safer if you weren't around.  You know, it comes from this breach in faith. 
[00:52:00]  We all trust each other here, and we don't lie to each other.  And then when a lie is made like that, we're like, hey, where does it end?  You know what I mean?  Okay.  Oh, I'm the guy.  You just made me the guy.  I just said that.  I've gotten that speech before.  Oh, no, you be the guy.  Well, we're going to go back to my cooking.  I don't care.  And beer.  Hang out.  Cookies and beer.  I'm fine.  We'll leave the door, Jaren.  We'll revisit this.  You're not fired.  You're on what we call a permanent layoff.  Oh, I've been laid off. 
[00:52:30]  All right, Rick, why don't you kill Brian the door?  Oh.  What?  Jeff?  That's terrible.  No, you guys are all right.  No, I think about it.  He's all right?  No, you guys are all right.  No, I think about it.  Why?  What were you thinking before?  I just felt like it was like mean.  Yeah, I mean, I feel so bad, but I mean, look, I'm kind of elaborate just to, you know,  we don't, and I, and I don't have to, we don't work with them.  It's someone like Spank.  I can see it in his face.  He's not happy.  Ben's not happy. 
[00:53:00]  I'm not happy.  I'm not happy.  Rick's not happy.  Yeah, I see.  That's what I mean.  I see the, you don't have enough brain cells to figure out that the guy's a psycho, psychopath.  Right.  You're working with him thinking everything's fine.  Brian, any final thoughts?  Oh, oh, oh, God.  Hey, you want to make a good statement?  It's been, it's been real.  Do you feel this is justified?  Somewhat.  If I brought in the case report, would you guys still become BS? 
[00:53:30]  Oh.  Well, I have a problem with the stitches that weren't there.  Yeah, even if you are in some kind of an accident, like the stitches not being there is a little weird.  Okay.  Not only that, if you really have an accident, then fine.  Call us until you have an accident.  But don't not call us or call other people in this building and then show up the next day that you're supposed to be here to work with an eye patch, a captain's hook hand, a freaking bandage on your head.  A parrot.  I'm surprised you didn't want to hop off your own leg just so you can limp in here. 
[00:54:00]  That's crazy.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break, Brian.  So, thank you.  Well, you know something.  What?  Send him home today.  And then let's really discuss this.  Because, you know, you know what it is.  Come on.  Have a little, you know, compassion.  I have compassion.  I just, I feel bad somewhere inside.  How old a guy are you?  What?  He's 20.  You didn't F up to tell a few wacky stories when you're 20?  But I F stuff so many times.  And Rick's been a lot cooler than that.  You didn't come in with a fake injury.  That's what I mean.  I'm on your side. 
[00:54:30]  I'm saying, Rick's been a go-to when you pull up.  Single white female territory.  It's weird if I could figure out why you did it.  I really still don't understand why you would do it.  Is there some kind of an issue you got?  Are there other issues?  It's hard to scream across the studio, but it's a matter of being really afraid of you guys  and being intimidated.  You're 19 feet away.  Is it an attention thing?  No.  You don't crave attention?  No.  Maybe?  No? 
[00:55:00]  Hmm.  Dude, you look ridiculous.  You're standing there with an eye patch that you probably don't need.  Oh, probably.  He's warming up to you.  All right.  We've got to move on with the show.  Okay.  So, look.  You go home for the rest of the day because he can't think under these circumstances.  And we'll get back to you on the long term of this.  Sure.  I just want to see it.  All right.  That's all.  And it's just letting you off the hook lightly.  No, I'm not.  I'm really interested to see it.  You'll get your phone call tomorrow.  Oh, thank you.  Look at the act.  Oh. 
[00:55:30]  I want to see it.  That's all.  All right, Rick.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you, Brian, for your service to this flying radio show.  Let's take a break, regroup, and do something different.  You've got all the tact of a rake.  We always bring this show to a hall.  Oh, reaching hall.  I'm playing.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Oh, it's fantastic. 
[00:56:00]  It's that beautiful Whistle now Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Those are real.  Whistle now.  How about that woman, Mr. Pete?  Shut up.  Ah, yeah.  Sexy girls.  Sexy girls.  You have stars.  Wow.  Social boobs.  Booth.  Spicy boobs.  Yes.  He just got wowed.  Wow.  Listen to the music.  That night.  Don't be an answer.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:56:30]  It's world renown.  It's Whistle now Wednesday.  It's Whistle now Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Those are real.  These are important.  Okay.  It's Whistle now Wednesday.  It's Whistle now Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whistle now Wednesday.  Huh?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  It's Opie.  We got f***ed.  We're in court.  I hope you're enjoying this worst of crap.  Trust me.  We're not happy. 
[00:57:00]  We're not here.  We'll be back on the radio tomorrow.  Also want to remind you guys, we're going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe after tomorrow's show.  Right after the show at 7.  On 57th between, what, 7th and Broadway, Ben?  Yes.  Hey, Ben's still here.  He has to run the board.  Sucker.  See you guys tomorrow.  We'll see you at the Hard Rock tomorrow night.  All right?  Peace.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Wow.  It's another wow sticker stop.  Black Earl will be at Sipperstein's Route 46 West in Lodi, New Jersey, this afternoon. 
[00:57:30]  Wow.  430 to 530.  Get some stickers.  See some food.  From 1027.  WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Here in New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  Now, this is 1027 WNEW.  We got a party going on today in the studio, huh, Anthony?  I'm hoping.  Yes.  I just received some brand new shots of Abigail. 
[00:58:00]  Whee!  Okay, that is sad.  Why is it sad?  It's sad.  She's just a little girl.  Oh, he's team?  No, he's no little girl.  I've seen the picture.  That is no little girl.  Okay, the picture doesn't look like a little girl, but she's still a little girl.  But her father's cool with it.  Oh, yeah, that's healthy.  Okay.  That's it.  No, no, no, no.  That, have you seen the picture?  That's wonderful.  Okay, that's what's wrong with America, people. 
[00:58:30]  No, this is everything that's right with America.  Why, you think that's wrong?  Well, I guess because of her age, right, Brittany?  Yeah, with her age.  She's not naked.  Brittany, what do you think?  Yeah, she's like in a bikini.  You got a real name like Perry Farrell in 1989.  Her dad picked out the vest for that photo.  He probably took the picture.  No, the dad picked out the vest.  Okay, that's even worse.  The motorcycle leather vest that she's wearing with nothing on her.  Abigail is dressed.  You've been sitting here babbling.  I'm sorry, I can't hold it anymore.  I have to leave you get poured a weenie because nothing was... 
[00:59:00]  Hey, nothing was coming out of your mouth.  I get more information when I call the freaking White House.  I got it.  I got it with Brittany something.  No, I couldn't take it anymore.  Okay, okay, I'll get a starter.  Where can I tell you the answer?  All right, Brittany.  Okay.  All right.  Well, this one, that one.  The other one.  Jesus, Henry.  Shut up.  You want to help me out?  Shut up.  Brittany.  Yes.  What are you doing?  Do you know who this raving lunatic is?  They asked me what I did for when I was an intern.  I don't know.  I told them I was an intern.  I got them in the water.  That's why I'm just asking who I was an intern. 
[00:59:30]  Ah, that must be the problem.  Oh, you're not an intern.  No, no, no.  You've never...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Don't say anything.  This is too good.  Brittany, what...  You're not an intern?  No.  What did you think he did for the radio show?  I don't know.  Please tell us.  Please tell us.  It'll make our year.  Yeah.  What did you actually think you did?  Just be honest.  Okay.  I'm glad you got him, like, water and stuff.  Water book!  It'll put a book!  But what you're missing is they asked me what I did. 
[01:00:00]  I said, I'm an...  I told her that.  Yeah.  I said, I'm an intern.  I got everybody water.  And then I came into the studio to sell it.  And I said, does anybody need water while I'm up?  And Kevin said, I'd love a water.  I said, okay, I gotta get water for Kevin.  Anybody else need anything?  Oh, my God.  He was being nice.  I was playing along.  Just string him along.  So you really thought he was, like, an intern or, like, whatever for the show?  Yeah, I didn't know who he was.  He's the water boy.  It's my favorite.  So, okay, so what do you do?  You tell me?  You tell me?  Oh, my God.  You're just on the air all the time, too.  No, I'm in town.  I live somewhere else. 
[01:00:30]  Sorry.  I haven't heard so far.  All right, hold on.  20 questions.  I've never been on it.  All right.  It's a very interesting job.  Try to figure out what he does.  Well, I'm guessing he's an intern, too.  Get the bell.  Get the bell.  Get the bell.  Wait, wait.  How many questions are we going to give?  I thought it was just open.  Ten.  All right.  Ten questions.  Obviously, you're on the air.  You're a DJ person.  That's your first question.  How many questions are we going to give her?  Ten.  Ten.  Ten questions to figure out what he does.  That's the first question.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  He's not officially a DJ.  All right.  All right.  Yes or no questions, Brittany?  Are you a reporter?  No, there's two.  Oh, are you...  You said you're a comedian.  Are you a comedian?  No, no, no.  You're a comedy, Dolphins.  That's funny.  Come on.  All right.  We'll give you some credit there.  All right.  All right. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, do you work for Penthouse?  That's five.  That's four.  You really don't know what he does.  This is great.  Okay.  Keep asking.  I'm so sorry.  Look at the glasses.  Wait.  How many questions?  Five?  Five.  Five to go.  Why else would you be in this room?  Yeah.  Why else would he be here?  Okay.  Can I have my water, please?  Yeah, I'll get some water.  All right.  Hold on, don't wreck it.  No one wreck it.  No, don't say anything. 
[01:02:00]  Don't get any questions.  Don't wreck it.  I thought you couldn't get more in the wing.  All right.  I'm looking at Lynn Thomas with her f***ing out in Penthouse.  And Lynn's going to be down at Hooters.  56 and Broadway.  And then it's Brittany.  Give a good.  It's like looking at the pebbles on the phone.  I'm going to hurt my feelings. 
[01:02:30]  I wouldn't have offered up that information.  All right.  This is a good game, though.  I love this game.  Four questions to go.  Four questions to go.  Figure out what he does.  Yes.  Okay.  For the record, my ego.  Work with the questions that you, you know, have to write in.  Comedian and ego.  All right. 
[01:03:00]  Oh.  Here you go right to get a point from that.  Okay.  Are you somebody famous?  I waited.  Oh, my God.  Are you a guest?  Not, you don't work with the show.  Are you a guest on the show just for today?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that could go either way.  You do all the time.  No one, not today.  No one invited me.  No, no one invited me.  No, he's usually a guest of this program.  He can come by any time he wants, just like Eddie and probably you if we make it through 
[01:03:30]  this show.  Leave a message on my machine when she's coming.  Oh.  No, I'm kidding.  All right.  All right.  We won't count that.  That question's bad.  We won't count it.  All right.  The answer's no.  Uh-oh.  All right.  All right.  Two questions.  All right.  Here's your show.  Eddie and Brittany.  You're a guest, Brittany.  Two questions to go.  What does Jay do?  Do you want to give me a hint?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  You're going to estimate the psycho factor.  No hint.  All right.  That's enough.  Are you usually on TV?  No.  Keep it in the buzzer.  I'm not usually on TV.  What?  You're on TV.  Stop. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  She's thinking of, like, sitcoms and stuff.  What?  No, no.  I'm going to say yes.  Okay, yeah.  Yes.  Every Sunday, he'll...  Oh.  I'm going to say yes.  One question to go.  Wow.  You don't know?  It's a stimulating radio.  Are you close to knowing, or you have no clue?  I have no clue.  Who this is sitting here.  I'm sorry.  I have absolutely no clue.  You know, they've been calling me since I've been here?  You know who my name is?  My first name? 
[01:04:30]  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I love this.  One question.  It might all come together.  One question.  This might go in.  Guess what Jay does.  You're on a comedy show?  That's it.  Okay, who are you?  We're not going to tell you.  I work at Joey Paisano.  Can I do the commercials for Joey Paisano?  Do you like movies?  Movies, Brittany.  Yes, I do.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:05:00]  Have you ever seen him in a movie?  Do you like...  Wait, wait, wait.  Do you like Tom Cruise?  Yeah.  That's Tom Cruise.  Have you...  Have you seen every Tom Cruise movie that's been made?  That's a good idea.  No.  I like where you're going.  No?  You haven't seen every one.  What Tom Cruise movies have you seen?  Ask her if she likes somebody else.  Oh, God.  Okay.  All right, hold on.  Let's see what Tom Cruise movies she's seen.  A Tom Cruise movie.  Don't jump in if...  No, no, no.  We'll go with it. 
[01:05:30]  Okay, I saw a vampire movie he was in.  Yes.  One of those...  Oh, Cocktail.  That was the movie he was in.  I don't know why you can't get guys to sleep with you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm not...  Okay, Tom Cruise.  I can't even think of what he's doing.  All right, all right.  I know he is.  Well, if we started Tom Cruise and we lost you,  there's pretty much a post-game for the rest of the afternoon.  All right.  Have you...  With, like, a vampire or something?  Somewhere?  Have you...  No, I'm not.  And then he's with Cocktail.  Have you seen any...  What movies have you been to recently? 
[01:06:00]  Oh, oh, oh, good.  Have you been to any new movies?  Yes, I went to Almost Famous when I got out of the house.  All right.  That movie.  Okay.  But, you know, and I didn't see any while I was in the house,  and I was busy with work and stuff.  I had to find stuff before, so I didn't...  It's been, like, months and months.  Did you ever see any Jennifer Aniston movies?  No.  Christopher Walken.  She's not a friend.  Christopher Walken.  You know Christopher Walken?  How about Scott Wolf?  Scott Wolf.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I don't know who you are.  Have you ever seen any Scott Wolf movies?  Kevin Spacey movies. 
[01:06:30]  Kevin Spacey.  Okay, so apparently you're an actor.  No.  No, yes, you are.  No, why help her out now?  We've got her on the run.  Okay.  She was this close to seeing if I worked for the Department of Park.  Kevin Spacey.  I like Kevin Spacey.  Are you in the Batman?  Are you in the Batman?  He was...  So, okay, what was the latest movie you were in?  No, no.  Let me say this.  He gets water for them.  He's in a movie that's out now.  Oh, what one?  You tell me.  You tell what?  Being that you were an intern, I have absolutely no idea what movie you were in. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, my God.  That is great.  I got Big Kev watered in the...  Hey, Kev, are you hydrated?  You know why?  Because that's a hot part of the issue.  I busted out the Sandler impression.  Okay.  Have you ever watched older episodes of Saturday Night Live?  I am Garrett Morris.  What?  I am a black cocaine teen that thinks aliens are trying to hypnotize me. 
[01:07:30]  Look, I didn't make it up.  Okay, I'm trying to figure out if I'm having more fun now or when you were trying to pry gossip out of me from Big Brother.  They're both pretty painful.  All right.  Brittany?  Yes.  No clue?  She's got no clue.  No, he's an actor.  We're going to link together co-stars and you link together the movie.  Oh, no.  Don't do this because I don't...  Don Cruz, Jennifer Aniston, Christopher Walken, Kevin Spacey, let's see, Angelina Jolie.  Scott Wolf. 
[01:08:00]  Scott Wolf.  Okay, did this come out this summer?  Because if it came out this summer...  No, they're not all in the same...  I think your headphones are too tight.  I have been locked in a house all summer.  I've been very busy since I've been out.  90 days.  Okay, I don't know if all these people are in a movie or not.  Tell me some slack, man.  I was in a movie called Jerry Maguire.  Did you ever see Jerry Maguire with Tom Cruise?  Yes, I did.  You saw Jerry Maguire?  I don't remember.  Where he's a sports agent guy.  Right?  I fired Tom Cruise.  Do you remember the guy that... 
[01:08:30]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  No more virgins.  No more virgins.  No more virgins.  Put it in the bathroom.  Jesus Christ!  Put it in the bathroom.  Put it in the bathroom.  Put it in the bathroom.  Put it in the bathroom.  Did you see Picture Perfect with Jennifer Aniston?  No.  Okay.  Brittany, that's Jerry Maguire.  Did you ever see Go, the movie Go?  No.  Paid Forward.  Paid Forward.  New movie.  No.  I didn't see that.  The little kid dies.  Okay.  I don't even know what this is.  It ruins the end of his life. 
[01:09:00]  Okay.  We'll go see the flick now.  No, the upside.  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  I got stuff from my reel.  It dies.  You should have seen it already if that ruined the movie for you.  Do you like football?  It's on Fox every Sunday morning.  Okay, yeah.  Fox every Sunday morning.  Fox Sports Net.  Fox Sports Net.  My new passion.  And, of course, one of these Saturday Night Live alumni.  And I did Suicide Kings.  Suicide Kings?  Did you ever see that?  Nope.  Did you ever see Oliver?  Nope.  Oh, that's not the keeper.  Paulie? 
[01:09:30]  Did you ever see Paulie?  Mafia?  You guys.  Did you ever see Mafia?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Yeah, we're digging demon.  Soldiers.  MPB's lip service.  Please know me.  Hey, Brittany.  Do you know who Andrew Dice Clay is?  Yes.  And if you walked in the door, you'd go, wow, that's Andrew Dice Clay?  Oh, that's nice, man.  Oh, now you've gone too far.  I've got to revert back to last week's shows, everyone.  It's easier to recognize, like, a quick flash in a pen character than it is, you know? 
[01:10:00]  Well, I'll be here.  Everybody knows Judy Canuda and not David Tell.  You know, David Tell's a steady, strong guy.  That's it.  David Tell.  I probably would only know him, though, Andrew Dice Clay, because of his voice, you know?  Right.  Yeah, huh?  Okay, honey, sure.  I can't know what he looks like, but I know his voice.  You don't know what he looks like?  Eddie, Eddie, I mean, I know his good job in general.  Where do you think?  I don't think you've been locked in a house for 90 days that was on camera.  Where were you locked before that?  Oh, you're saying no one minute.  You're going to show you grew up in a freaking Skinner Box.  Seriously, I didn't really have, I mean, I just, I worked, and I went to school, and 
[01:10:30]  I don't know.  And I was the only one in the room that got the reference.  That's why we love you.  All right.  Okay, well, I'm excited.  Oh, there you go, Brittany.  That's Jay Moore.  Jim Norton, what's going on?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, Norton.  Hey, Norton.  As far as what Jay does for a living, the entire country has been asking that question for  three years.  And as far as not seeing you in Jerry Maguire, apparently she didn't have a freeze frame on her  DVD.  Oh, man. 
[01:11:00]  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  You're funny, Tony.  Wow.  You stopped him in his tracks with that one, Jay.  Dad can be awful about me when I'm not there, so I have to say things out quickly.  That's not true.  That's not true.  When you're not here, I always say you're funnier than Dice.  I'll see you guys later, man.  I just wanted to call real quick and, you know, I just wanted to find out who this person was.  Hey, Jim.  Yeah.  Go yourself.  Go yourself. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  It's S.  Right.  He doesn't understand the rules here.  I'll see you guys later.  All right, man.  See you, Jimmy.  We definitely got to take a break.  Jim Norton.  Very funny, man.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Sounds good.  All right.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  It's Opie.  We got f***.  We're in court.  So I hope you're enjoying this worst of crap.  Trust me.  We're not happy.  We're not here.  We'll be back on the radio tomorrow.  Also want to remind you guys we're going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe after tomorrow's show.  Right after the show at 7 on 57th between what?  7th and Broadway, Ben?  Yes.  See, Ben's still here.  He has to run the board.  Soccer. 
[01:12:00]  See you guys tomorrow.  We'll see you at the Hard Rock tomorrow night.  All right?  Peace.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Wow.  It's another wow sticker stop.  Black Earl will be at Sipperstein's Route 46 West, Lodi, New Jersey, this afternoon.  Wow.  430 to 530.  Get some stickers.  These are booze.  From 1027.  WNEW.  The power.  The wow sticker. 
[01:12:30]  There's a carpet around next to me.  Whip out your can.  Pull out your fun bag.  Let's do anything for it.  Do it.  Do it now.  The wow is.  It's fabulous.  Opie and Anthony.  Even homos like seeing boobs in kind of time.  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, if the president was in Vietnam.  I know.  I saw that on the news.  He's taking this little trip to Vietnam.  And I guess it's some kind of goodwill trip that he's taking. 
[01:13:00]  He's just wasting time.  It's so obvious that this guy is.  He's out.  You know, regardless of who they put in there now.  But that whole debacle.  Looks like it's going to be Bush as early as tomorrow.  Well, we'll see.  Watch.  Watch what happens.  It'll go on and on forever.  But Clinton now, he would never have done something like this to this extent.  Because he should get bashed for this.  The guy is a disgrace.  And the veterans that served in Vietnam ought to, well, they already can't stand him. 
[01:13:30]  But they really should be up in arms now.  Because what the hell business does he have going over there and shaking these people's hands?  And smiling and laughing at them.  And I was thinking about this.  It's as if you get a bunch of your friends together, right?  And they're going to fight with a bunch of other guys.  And then one of your group of friends runs away from the fight.  And your friends get their asses kicked.  Then a little while later, you go over to the guys that beat up your friends and start shaking hands and smiling. 
[01:14:00]  Taking pictures.  Then your friends look like they turn around and go, what?  You effing tool.  Does this have something to do with Clinton being a draft dodger?  Hey.  Oh.  You're quick now today.  Look at that.  The big yellow ones.  I had the firm and I was going to school.  But now, 30 years later, he steps off Air Force One and now he's in Vietnam.  This, ooh, scary.  Wow, look at this.  Ooh, look.  A place selling McDonald's and Coca-Cola. 
[01:14:30]  Petrifying.  Landed in a, oh my God, Air Force One.  It's a hot LV.  Hot LV.  Red smoke.  No, there's nothing going on.  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  No, no.  You missed all the action now.  Mr. Clinton.  What?  I got my little radio here.  I'm like the radio man.  Hot.  Zips in the wire.  Hold that perimeter.  Snake and Nate on my pod.  No, none of that's going on anymore.  God damn slopes.  No.  Play the music when we come into the airport, Air Force One. 
[01:15:00]  Play the music.  Drive the slopes crazy.  See that one running?  Go ahead.  Put the pontoon right up her ass.  I'm going to smoke me some weed.  Hey, this is great.  You ever do a shotgun?  I swear, this is great.  Look, we're here in our bunker.  Let me just crack the shotgun for you.  There we go.  Look, now I'm going to blow the smoke in through the magazine. 
[01:15:30]  And you just smoke it out of the barrel.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Feeling good.  Hey, this ain't your show alive.  This ain't your show.  Look, I'm firing out the door of Air Force One. 
[01:16:00]  Down on the rock caddy.  This is like if no one shoots back.  I'm trusting.  Mr. President, how can you shoot innocent women and children?  It's easy.  You just don't lead them as much.  God damn, this is a blast with no one shooting back.  God damn, look at that dude.  I even shoot the water buffaloes.  I don't care.  Whatever it takes.  Leave that goddamn door open.  This is so much fun when I know they can't shoot back. 
[01:16:30]  That's right.  Psycho Mark's out here with me.  Where's that little napalm slope girl running down the street?  I'll take her out.  You're a little too late.  What?  Mr. President.  What happened?  Where'd everyone go?  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  Now, the war's over here.  It smells like victory. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  The dog wants to talk to me.  You're getting the finger banging.  Old Mary Jane Bunch-a-Rod to her pretty pink panties are over.  No, no, no.  Don't tell me that.  I'm the president.  Hey, look who it is.  June.  God, come on.  Goddamn.  Come on.  Everyone goes home.  No one left behind.  No one left behind.  Where's the Charlie I heard about so much? 
[01:17:30]  I love it.  Open up that front door.  Let's go, boys.  Woo-hoo.  God, I love this.  Get up, you dink.  Tim Dolly, love you long time.  Come in.  Come in.  I thought that goose had a grenade, but it was just a Big Mac and a pizza.  But, hell, these things happen in more times.  Unbelievable. 
[01:18:00]  Go on.  No more Yankee, my country.  I love this.  Knee deep in the rice paddy.  Wait, what's he going for?  Oh, it's just a piece of rice.  Sorry.  Come on.  Let's do the whole village.  Let's do the whole village.  Holy ass.  You ever see a head come apart like that?  Yeah, I really think I can. 
[01:18:30]  30 years late.  I'm in combat.  This is great.  Why did I miss this?  It's so easy.  I don't know what I was so scared of when they told me to report.  And I ran off to England because this is just a piece of cake.  You take your big jet plane, you fly low.  Look at this.  There's another five.  I just walked out of.  Groovy.  Why would he pick Vietnam? 
[01:19:00]  He's got two months to waste.  And he goes over there.  I'm going to call in an airstrike.  Come on, boys.  Come on.  Oh, look at that.  It's a beautiful man.  It's just a beautiful man.  Unbelievable.  This is a lie.  Get the claymores.  Nothing's going on anymore, you idiot.  Goddamn surrounded by gook arms and legs.  Fly over the Hanoi Hilton.  Everyone goes home. 
[01:19:30]  Everyone goes home.  Everyone goes home.  Oh, boy.  Come on.  We've got to take a break.  Jesus, man.  Kenton in Vietnam.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  It was on the news.  Huh?  The submarine thing. 
[01:20:00]  That's a pretty wacky story.  It's getting better and better every day, too.  Well, like I said, new details come out every day.  They just trickle a few things out.  I'm sure the military would love to just keep everything quiet with this thing, but they can't.  There were civilians on board this sub, and they were off of Hawaii, somewhere in the Pacific, and they did one of those power surface maneuvers they do. 
[01:20:30]  They just blow the ballast tanks, and the thing comes up like a fish, doing that, like a dolphin.  And, oops, Jack Trawler was right above him.  You could say Jack, Rick.  It was an acceptable term back in the 40s.  So it was colored, but I guess we can't use Jack.  You could use Jack.  Jack Trawler.  I hate political.  In the water.  It wasn't Chinese.  Rick, they were Japs.  Rick writes Chinese.  Look at how politically incorrect you are. 
[01:21:00]  I don't care.  They're just chinks.  They have slanty eyes.  They're slanty eyes.  It's all the same.  That was a Jack Trawler.  And the sub comes up, and what luck.  The sub came up right underneath the boat.  Oh.  Sunk it in, like, nine minutes.  Now, it just sounded at first, like, oh, that's tragic.  You know, the sub comes up.  Then it turns out there were some civilians on board.  The sub.  Yeah, on board the sub.  Yeah.  But they said they weren't near any of the controls or anything.  Then it comes out that one guy is at the helmsman station. 
[01:21:30]  Fuck, they were like soldiers or the seamen behind them.  You said seamen.  Both posts up by the helm were taken by civilians.  Then it turns out it seems every post was manned by a civilian, but there were one of the guys that was supposed to be stationed there right behind him watching.  The guy that actually did the ballast blow maneuver was a civilian.  He pulled the lever.  So, they said they checked. 
[01:22:00]  They looked through the periscope.  They did their sonar check.  The sonar check, an hour before, showed the boat.  It was there.  They knew it was there.  Then the sonar guy left.  They said he was distracted by a civilian on board.  Whoops.  Yeah.  Oops.  Oops.  Here's my theory.  They had a little fun.  They got some civilians on board they want to show.  Does your theory have anything to do with O.J. killing anyone?  Yes.  O.J. was working the captain's head because he had cut it off like a puppet. 
[01:22:30]  Of course, reverting back to the...  Prophet's a ship.  Who cares about the slanty-eyed bastards?  It's O.J. and Joel.  Reverting back to the beginning of the show.  Okay.  Go ahead.  So, I'm thinking some civilians on board.  You want to show off a little bit?  Command and a sub.  You got all the guys in there.  Wouldn't it sound close to like, hey, watch this.  We are going to pop up in front of this trawler and scare the bejesus out of these Japs.  Just watch.  It's going to be great.  For a goof.  For a goof.  Imagine that.  You're sitting in a trawler. 
[01:23:00]  You're like, oh, very good.  We learn fish.  We learn put net in water.  Bring up a stripper.  And a few spheres and other things that Americans find cute and don't want cared.  Bring up a net.  And then...  So, for a chuckle.  Why not?  Imagine that though.  It's just out in the water.  And for a goof.  And you would F your pants on the side.  Oh, my God.  You're just sitting there.  All of a sudden, this huge submarine comes flying out of the water in front of you.  Godzilla!  Oh, no!  Godzilla! 
[01:23:30]  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Sorry.  Oh, no!  You know, just scare the hell out of him. 
[01:24:00]  Be a goof.  Yeah.  But since the sonar guy wasn't right there, I guess they figured, well, it's got to be close by.  It can't be right over us.  wrong oh right over him and uh took a big chunk out of it and it sunk in like nine minutes  bunch of people have died a lot of people lived though there were some the survivors  water is so cold 
[01:24:30]  i'm here hold on i'm here hold on to you  hang hold on check  little tiny riff what's that i hear as the icy water put me in a daze is that serene dion  that huge camera toll in the side of our boat  when we get to america you will be in the yankee cranky shop 
[01:25:00]  or in their saran  or work at sushi restaurant  what the hair was that  it was so nice when you draw me on the ship  you like a naked drawing i do of you  you like a naked pigeon 
[01:25:30]  yes but why you make a rag so short and ass so frat  that's how you rook  you all rook that way  ring bear  ring bear  i am the emperor of the world  this is a short movie nine minutes wrong and we sunk  crap 
[01:26:00]  not even time to send up a frat  not even time to whip up a frat  you're going to whip up a frat  the line  oh yoshi on boat  yoshi go both ways chinese and japanese  oh we all went in the water  boat went down nine minutes  that's when sharks come cruising  i guess about seven o'clock first ones came  and it's like they're pounding and pounding 
[01:26:30]  you hear high pitched screaming and harrowing  harrowing  but they just keep pounding and pounding  rifer's eyes like a geisha girl's eyes  you are  you are  i believe that's so powerful  you are  throwing me the rocking chair one  i will not stand by 
[01:27:00]  as you perform something out of a half-half-thouse  top  see you on the pitch  i won't stand here while you cut that thing open  and watch that little tongue twang  boy  four out all over dark  a rice bird dead ahead  What's that tragedy?  Uh-oh, shots come cruising.  I'll never put on a life jacket again. 
[01:27:30]  Are you ready to go back?  You're ready to go back.  Big shot.  Look like a big hand roll.  I'm cruising.  Caves go in the water.  Chang-tang go in the caves.  Farewell in the door.  Do you fare?  Chang-tang-bang, ready? 
[01:28:00]  And amazing.  As he went down, the band kept praying and praying.  The band prayed on.  Many died that day.  But there were some far-fifers.  I dedicate this song to the brave men and women of the S.S. Chang-tang.  I'm the swan, swan, swan, swan, swan. 
[01:28:30]  I'm the swan, swan, swan, swan, swan.  King, swan, swan.  That's my heart, Will.  Very dishonorable.  I came over the water.  I crap myself.  Very dishonorable.  Let's go to the phones.  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Every time we had civilians on board, we used to go crazy showing off. 
[01:29:00]  Wait, you were on one of those subs?  Yeah, I did eight years on a ballistic missile sub.  So you would show off on a civilian missile.  Watch us talk on that.  This one's great.  So you would show off on the civilians.  What would you do?  Well, we used to do what they called angles and dangles.  We used to go down really fast and go deep and then pull it back up.  And one time we had such an upward angle that we lost all our navigations.  Everything went offline because we had too steep of an angle.  Ah, who cares?  All right. 
[01:29:30]  It's like, ah, what a ride.  Who cares?  We need navigation.  It's the sea.  There's nothing out here.  Watch the civilians wrap themselves.  They used to be crazy.  Boy, that's funny.  You're hilarious.  Very funny.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Crack the boat open right to fortune cookie.  What up?  Hey, man, I was in here for four years.  And when you come back from Hawaii, like San Francisco, you pulled a tiger cruise.  And you can bring, like, three of your family members to ride on board.  And you got little kids driving the ship.  You got the old geriatrics. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, my God.  This is great.  What did you do?  Oh, no.  I was going to get on the way to sell pieces of the trawler on the home shopping.  Yeah.  All right, buddy.  Let's go to Chuck.  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, I was in the military for four years.  They let my father drive an aircraft carrier.  He's a phone man.  Oh, come on, man.  Come on.  Is that true, though, Brian?  Yeah, man.  Like the guy said, man, they take you from Hawaii to San Diego warehouse station.  And on the way back, they do a bunch of tours. 
[01:30:30]  They took him up to the bridge.  The guy watched him.  And there he is.  He's got pictures and everything of him steering a thousand-foot, billion-dollar aircraft carrier.  Look, I'm driving.  What's that?  All right, guys.  You rule.  All right.  Later.  Who's driving both? 
[01:31:00]  Who's driving submarines?  It's Eric Hartman.  Ah, Rudy, what's going on?  Uh, 1982, I was running a 148-foot supercruiser off Montauk Point.  About 100 people on board.  We had a submarine come up right in front of us.  That's great.  And I know I s***ed myself.  Oh, hey, oh, hey.  Hold on, hold on.  A submarine came up in front of your boat and you crapped yourself.  Yeah.  That's got to be intense looking. 
[01:31:30]  We're doing about 26, 28 knots on a 148-footer.  I do believe we have audio from that day.  It's not right for us.  No, how close was it?  Uh, came up about, uh, within 100 yards.  Had my feet up.  You've got to think they do that crap on purpose because they're bored out there.  That's not right.  They're supposed to put up a warning before they come up.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Jep sub, slam two torpedoes into our side.  They're going to pay back a b***h. 
[01:32:00]  If I knew that would happen, I'd go to Reeve.  I'd turn around.  Chief, what's going on?  You guys make me rock so hard.  I'm going to drop crouching tiger in me, come on up.  Let's go to Marianne.  Marianne, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  I just called because, um, I knew I kept my mouth shut long enough about wanting to hear  some Yoshi bits that he'd eventually turn up somewhere.  And there he was on the suburb, um, on the, uh, fishing ship. 
[01:32:30]  Who knew?  Yeah, Yoshi on, uh, the Titanic.  I was just delivering some 20, 20.  My little bicycle on the deck of boats.  I was going to pet her back to Manhattan.  Oh, that's my guy.  I love you, Jack.  I know you rubbed me.  There's plenty of room on that door you're floating on.  I never understand why you want to rat me on. 
[01:33:00]  And then when we all die, we end up back on Japanese trara.  All young again, waiting for another submarine.  What?  Very, very touching tribute to those people. 
[01:33:30]  God damn it.  Oh, sugar stays out to the waist.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, they were hit with a boatload of semen, too.  Well, they was.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  They're really skinny as owls.  Look at the chinks.  That's what he is.  Uh, Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys, how's it going?  Good, man.  Anyhow, I was in Coronado.  I was coming back on a tiger cruise on Destroyer.  About 400 guys or so.  We let somebody's, the captain's father, actually drive the ship.  So we're coming through underneath the Coronado Bridge, and this other boat was coming right 
[01:34:00]  for us.  Come right for us.  He's coming right for us.  So anyhow, we're coming right through it, and the captain goes, you know, we're telling the  captain, you get a little close.  And he's like, no, he'll move.  This guy's coming right for us.  And sure enough, they hit us.  The whole thing goes all the way down.  Now we stop the ship.  Now we stop the ship.  And then we stop.  Everything comes in.  The border, everybody comes over trying to get this guy out.  But it is a true fact.  They do let people drive the ships on a tiger cruise.  That's just amazing. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  I guess it happens every time, but when they come up and nail a Japanese trawler.  It's pretty, it's pretty bad.  All they would have had to do is feed some spinach to the ship.  Right in the engine.  Would have kicked the subs ask.  Wait a minute.  Hey, Stinsky, load up my bowl.  Wayne, what's up?  Hey, man, listen, I was in the Navy during NAMM, and I remember being at sea in the North  Atlantic and firing salvo rounds over top of a Russian fishing ship just for the hell of 
[01:35:00]  it because, you know, they were out there, and we were firing rounds over top of them.  They were on the radio talking back to us in Russia.  We had no idea what they were doing.  I was on the quarter deck listening to this.  Were you on the weed?  Were you on the weed?  Were you listening to the Jimi Hendrix music blasting and firing rounds?  Yeah, Hendrix a little bit, you know, Hendrix a little bit of deep purple, you know, and  You take away all the death and destruction, NAMM just looked like one big party.  It was on the earth. 
[01:35:30]  Some cool equipment and plenty of drugs and nice rock music.  There you go, Daddy-O.  I swear to God, you know.  And, you know, as long as you still talk like you live in the 70s, people leave you alone.  I swear to God, man.  All right, Wayne, thank you.  All right, let's take a break, huh?  Bye.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Hey, guys, what's up?  It's Opie.  We got f***ed.  We're in court.  So I hope you're enjoying this worst of crap.  Trust me, we're not happy.  We're not here.  We'll be back on the radio tomorrow.  Also want to remind you guys, we're going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe after tomorrow's show. 
[01:36:00]  Right after the show at 7 on 57th between, what, 7th and Broadway, Ben?  Yes.  See, Ben's still here.  He has to run the board.  Sucker.  See you guys tomorrow.  We'll see you at the Hard Rock tomorrow night, all right?  Peace.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-1-W-N-E-W.  Wow.  It's another Wow sticker stop.  Black Earl will be at Sipperstein's Route 46 West, Lodi, New Jersey, this afternoon.  Wow.  4-30 to 5-30.  Get some stickers.  Bees and booze.  From 1-0-2-7-1-W-N-E-W. 
[01:36:30]  Хорошо.  It's the only show. 
[01:37:00]  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Yeah, Superfly singing along.  I am Superfly, man.  What's happening?  What up, brother man?  212-757-1027 is our phone line. 
[01:37:30]  I just watched this in the studio.  Yeah.  What is this one all about?  Hold on, hold on.  I'm just a flaming fag.  One of those.  Rick always likes pulling the clips of us saying we're fags.  Sort of justifies him being, I guess.  All right, so I just walked into the studio and Anthony was laughing his ass off with him.  What the hell did I miss?  Well, I'll tell you something.  We didn't have our own spaz here for, what, two days? 
[01:38:00]  Was it two days?  Was it two days that we were spaz-less?  And the phone suffered.  And I think everybody was in sort of a weird mood.  Yeah.  It's like when you have to take your beagle to the vet and he's got to stay over.  You go home and there's just something missing.  Something missing.  Oh, there's no one crapping on the floor or eating the furniture or, you know, you don't  got to feed it and it's a pain in the ass of walking and the fleece.  But something's missing in that house, isn't it?  You feel a little empty. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  An empty feeling comes upon you.  And then we realized it was spaz.  Spaz is the catalyst of this radio show.  Not two seconds after I walk into this studio, me and Ben are just laughing our balls off at  spaz telling us about his couple of days off.  All right, can I back up before you tell that story?  Yeah.  So everyone knows by now I'm in a lot of pain.  Yeah.  I'm really dead back and I was home last night.  Phone rings and it's spaz.  He calls you at home?  He just calls me at home.  I don't think he would ever call me at home. 
[01:39:00]  And he calls me at home and I'm like, why are you calling me at home?  He goes, well, I noticed you have a relationship with everyone else on the show.  So I figured I'd call and see what's going on.  That's great.  And I'm just on the couch in pain, you know.  That is fun.  Oh, effing great.  And he goes, I don't want you guys to think I'm really stupid.  But I am.  You know, that's spaz we can review.  You don't really think I'm stupid, do you? 
[01:39:30]  No, not at all.  No, not until he started talking about his little...  All right, wait, wait.  Get spaz in here.  This is just classic.  You got to hear from his own head.  Spaz.  Hey, spaz.  Welcome back to the fold.  Lift up that mic.  Thank you.  Is it true you're now calling me at home because you want to have a relationship with me?  Not in a sexual...  Not in a sexual sense, but you feel like I have relationships with everyone else that works on the show.  Hey. 
[01:40:00]  And you kind of felt a little left out so you decided, you know, maybe to break the ice you'd call me at home, right?  I just thought I'd get a little closer to the show.  And spaz, why didn't you give me a call?  Yeah, right.  I don't have your number.  Everyone knows just to leave you alone.  Just leave me alone.  I'm best just left alone.  I show up for the show, do the show, then leave me alone again.  Like in spaz's head, he debates, hmm, should I call up at home?  But when it comes in, it's like, no, he just knows I just will not call him at home ever. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Spaz, you want a little relationship with the show?  What are you doing this weekend?  What am I doing this weekend?  Any plans Saturday?  Um, I'm working...  Any plans maybe Sunday?  No, not at all.  How'd you like to hold my alarm?  Huh?  But Spaz, you think I have relationships with everyone else on the show?  And you just feel like we haven't been connected lately?  I just want, like, an outside relationship.  Like, just maybe hang out maybe once. 
[01:41:00]  Maybe once.  Hang out?  No, just so you can get to know me outside of work most.  You mean, like, hang out, have a few beers?  Yeah.  Maybe talk about the colored...  What?  I think he's talking more like going to Chuck E. Cheese and going into the ball cage.  No.  I mean, like, he's 23 now.  He's 23.  I think you can handle the ball cage at Chuck E. Cheese.  Now, um...  It's bad.  What would you like to do outside the station?  None of us have lives outside this radio show. 
[01:41:30]  We're boring.  No, just, like, hang out, have a couple beers, kick back, shoot the breeze.  You know, just talk.  You know, just...  Just talk about things.  What's going on in each other's lives.  Just connect.  God, me and Ovi don't even do that.  We used to do that, but now it's like, uh-huh.  We used to do that.  I don't even live near you anymore.  Well, that's the big problem with that.  But, uh, so we'd go out and we'd drink beers, and I wanted to have lunch last weekend, but  you were busy.  Yeah.  That old dad. 
[01:42:00]  I was busy.  Well, I spend most of the week these days in the city, and he wanted me to come all the  way back in the city on a Saturday to have lunch with him.  I'm like, on a Saturday?  It's not going to work.  Well, that's like a day off and everything.  Maybe after, uh, after the show, start off with a couple of beers at a bar somewhere or  something.  Yeah.  Smash, give us, like, a scenario.  So you call me up and say, hey, Ope, let's, uh, let's go get some beers.  Yeah, let's go hang out.  Uh, wherever you go to get beers, I would come down.  Hello, Ovi? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Uh, Greg, if I may call you.  Yeah.  Hi, this is Spice.  Hi, Kevin.  Oh, oh, okay, Kevin.  Kevin, yeah.  Um, listen, uh, I'm not doing anything, um, this weekend.  I'm wondering if you want to meet me in Philly for a Tuesday.  Yeah, I'm going to be here anyway.  So, uh, all right, and then, then what happens?  Like, no, we just talk and see, uh, you know, you get to know me outside of the show.  You get to know a little bit more about who I am. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Can I mow your lawn?  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Huh?  All right, I guess we can do that.  Oh, wow.  Can I tape the whole thing for the radio?  Yeah.  I just thought it'd be better if we knew each other a little bit more.  Well, that's probably worse.  It's the best left on those working relationships.  You don't want to get in my pants, do you?  No.  Let's just get it out on the table.  Get to know me. 
[01:43:30]  I need some hot man, bro.  That's what girls say.  Get to know you better.  Guys just, like, hang out.  No, I just want to hang out.  Like, guys hang out.  It's not like a big planned thing.  You're just like, hey, well, you're done.  Guys just hang out.  They don't, like, you know, say, I want to get to know you better.  You just kind of hang out and then, I don't know.  Get to know how you started off your career a little bit more.  I think we went through that on the air, didn't we?  Yeah, but it's different off the air.  Yeah, it's not as personal, is it?  Yeah.  Forty hours a week isn't enough?  No, but, I mean, outside, it should just kick back. 
[01:44:00]  I want to spend more time with you than the girl I'm living with, than Sandy.  Yeah, but I think you should know me outside of the show.  Really?  And I should know you outside of the show.  Is there something to know?  No, but, I mean, what do you want to know who you're working with?  I work at Bell Laboratories.  I'm actually a rocket scientist.  There's something you should know about me. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Matt wants to know if you're gay.  Matt.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Dude, is he gay?  He sounds like my crying girlfriend.  He's unbelievable.  I want to hang out with you.  I want to hang out with you.  What's wrong with you, Spad?  The guy's just, guy's just like, all of a sudden, it just happens.  They hang out.  They don't make plans or anything.  You finish work, and you say, oh, you want to go grab a beer?  And you go grab a beer. 
[01:45:00]  You don't make plans.  Girls make plans.  Girl chicks make plans.  Right.  Chicks make plans in advance and all that.  Guys, it just happens.  You see out at the bar, oh, I have to go to the bathroom.  You want to come with me?  Look, all right, Spad, this is how it works, okay?  All right.  I'm staying in the city tonight.  Yeah.  We're thinking of maybe just going to get some food after work.  Is that okay?  You want to join us?  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  There you go.  That's what you do.  Okay.  You don't go like, hey, what are you doing Saturday?  You know.  I just like to know what I'm doing. 
[01:45:30]  What are you going to be wearing?  I mean.  I just like to know what I'm doing.  All right.  Well, don't wait.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Oh, my goodness.  I'm not kidding.  Reggie, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  There's an ulterior motive here.  The ulterior motive is he used to be able to say he just worked with you guys and hook up. 
[01:46:00]  He wants personal friends with the Opesta, you know what I'm saying?  Well, he's a friend of ours.  I know, but he's using you guys.  It's not so much.  The funny thing is, it's, you know, the Opie and Anthony show.  Exactly.  But obviously, Spaz is, I don't know, drawn more to Opie, feeling that he should have this  relationship with Opie.  You're like the third wheel now.  I feel withdrawn from you.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I've got to let you go, Reggie.  It's getting better in here. 
[01:46:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  One minute.  He's very sentimental.  He should be right in Hallmark class.  Yeah, okay.  Thank you, Reggie.  You feel what toward Anthony?  Withdrawing.  He feels withdrawn towards me.  Why?  I feel like this is blockade because I remember there was one plan Anthony was saying on the  air that the only people he talks to were you and then sometimes Reggie can talk just  about the show.  He talks to no one else.  Yeah.  I figured that he doesn't want to take any calls from anybody else.  I feel like he's putting that blockade towards, around him, towards everybody else.  Okay.  Finally, Spaz is right. 
[01:47:00]  And just don't talk to anyone, though.  But believe me, I would love to call him just, you know, sorry.  It's just that we only know each other, like, in work mode as coworkers.  I like to know each other as friends, too.  You know, outside social.  Maybe you could, I don't know, hook me up at one of those hotel rooms you get.  Yeah, we've got to get back into that.  Oh, this is too funny.  So, Spaz, okay, look.  We probably are going to get a bite to eat after work.  You can join us. 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  That's how it works.  I'd love to.  You would love to.  I'd love to.  Just don't sit next to me.  Can I tell you both of them?  Sit, like, on the other side of the table.  How am I supposed to talk to you?  Why do you want to talk to me?  Oh, my God.  Even when we go out, we go out all the time after the show, and we don't talk.  We just sit there and eat our food and get drunk.  I always end up talking to Earl, but that's no fun.  Get the hit.  You goof on stuff, that's all.  We have, like, a kiddie table when we go out.  It's pretty funny. 
[01:48:00]  We have, like, the...  Not saying the main guys, but, like, Rick, Ben, Psycho Mark, me, Ant when he goes out  with us.  And then we have, like, a kiddie table that has, like, stinky black girl and fat.  It's a kiddie table.  So he's trying to get into the conversation, and he's just not paying attention.  But they're at the other table, and they try to get involved, but it's just not working.  That's a short one.  I want to break that barrier.  You want to...  I want to break that barrier. 
[01:48:30]  Have you been going to, like, counseling or something?  No, I just feel like we should know each other more.  Oh, there's the barrier.  Broke right through it.  Guys, Ant and I are, like, pretty good friends.  We've been hanging for seven years.  We don't need to get to know each other that well.  Yeah, we know each other.  We know each other.  You just...  When you hang out with guys, you just know them.  Yeah, but I feel that I want to work with you guys for a long time,  so I feel like I should get to know you as best as I can.  I love the revelations that come out.  All right. 
[01:49:00]  So, it's so cool.  Well, let's start with a little dinner tonight, okay?  That'll be great.  Okay.  Now it's going to be awkward.  After the show, it's going to be...  Yeah, it's totally, like, awkward now.  Now Opie's going to be totally paranoid to be left alone.  What's that?  You know why?  I'll tell you something, because it started out hanging out,  people going out.  You know what this is turning into?  A frigging date.  It's a date.  It's turning into a date.  Even though there's...  You know...  Because I don't feel like abusing you.  I know there's nothing gay about this, 
[01:49:30]  but now you put me in an awkward situation  where I'm going to feel like,  oh, God, now I've got to sit next to them.  Now you've got to talk to them.  We're going to walk in the restaurant.  Now I'm going to have to purposely make sure you sit close to me  so I can, like, you know,  make me believe I care about what you have to say.  Hey!  Hey!  Whoa!  Hey!  How's the mood going?  How is my family?  I don't even know.  How is Sandy doing today?  How is Erica doing today?  We should be asking these questions.  We should be asking these questions. 
[01:50:00]  No one cares.  I don't care.  Be quiet, sir.  All right, so now we've got the awkwardness of,  after the show, we're going to dinner,  and I'll make sure you sit close enough  where I can ask you a couple awkward questions.  How would you like to move my law?  Huh?  I know you're not going to touch me,  but it's not even that.  He's got to tell me I'm not going to touch you.  Oh, man!  Oh!  No, just so you get to know this out.  And, for the love of God, come out with us tonight. 
[01:50:30]  Okay, terrific.  It'll give us a whole show tomorrow.  This is great.  This is just some great,  great, funny stuff.  I'm not gay.  We're not saying you're gay!  You're giving us an opportunity to, you know,  abuse you and say you're gay for the next half hour,  but it's even weirder the other way.  That you care that much.  I care about you guys as friends.  No one cares about me that much.  I care about you guys as friends and as co-workers,  but I only know you as co-workers. 
[01:51:00]  I want to know you guys as friends.  Spaz, you know how you make the line  between co-worker and friend?  And this is an honest way to assess it.  Seriously.  If this job ended tomorrow,  after like a week of calling and talking to each other about,  oh, my God, I can't believe we all got the boot,  would we ever hang out again?  Now, you've got to seriously assess this.  Me and Ope, I could honestly see, yes, hanging out.  Going, we'd have to look for a new job.  Yeah.  So, that.  I would hang out with Rick 
[01:51:30]  because I'm going out with his sister.  Right.  That's pretty much the only reason there.  Ben, Psycho Mark,  you know, it would be nice to think  that we would actually keep in touch,  but in time, you know how radio is and stuff.  Once you lose, like the people at AAF up in Boston,  we don't speak to one of those people.  I'll go back to my gang at BAB.  Yeah.  We were real tight,  and I don't see any of them anymore.  So, there's a workplace camaraderie that goes on,  but as far as the really getting into the personal life,  you know, my friend, let's say,  Joe Currier, Adam Ferrara, 
[01:52:00]  they don't work here with us,  but we have a very good friendship that goes over the years.  No matter what happens at my work,  I'm still friends with them.  See, I don't know if that's going on yet.  I'm not saying it might not,  but the way to make dates like this  isn't the way to really get it going.  Hey!  If the show broke up tomorrow...  I would see Opie.  I would see Ant, and I would see Rick.  Rick wouldn't see Ant much.  Probably not,  unless we all got another gig together.  And I would definitely not see Ben,  Psycho Mark, or you again. 
[01:52:30]  Probably not.  Within a...  Yeah!  It'd be like the phone calls about,  oh my God, you know,  how's it going?  You know, got any leads on the job  or something like that?  If I saw you in the park,  drunk on a park bench,  I might say,  hey, what's up?  You'd run away.  You know?  I'd talk to you if I bumped into you,  but the reality is  I probably wouldn't hang out with you anymore.  Yeah, it's like a working relationship  where you're very good friends at work,  but that's pretty much...  I mean, nothing against you as a person,  but that's just how it goes.  There have been some very good people  and very good friends at the workplace 
[01:53:00]  that we just don't talk to anyone.  That's the nature of the beast.  We worked in Boston for three years,  and we had some pretty close relationships,  with people at the station  and outside the station.  I hang out with one of them.  That's it.  Yeah.  Not even a phone call?  Every once in a while.  No.  Call me.  You want me to call you?  Call me.  Yeah, it would have been nice  because I keep calling you  and I don't...  I get one of these calls.  Oh my God, dude,  it sounds like a dick.  Oh my God.  No, I call you. 
[01:53:30]  Dude, are you stalking him?  No.  It's just that I'm trying to get to know him.  Oh.  Okay, I'm getting a little jealous of Spock.  Why do I have all the psychopaths after me?  I'm not a psycho.  Why doesn't Anthony have the psychopaths?  I call him if you give me his number.  Yeah, that's why.  He's an incredibly talented individual.  Latch on to him.  Why doesn't he latch it on to me?  I'm not latching on.  It's just that I want to...  I feel like I don't know you. 
[01:54:00]  I feel like I don't know you.  These are words that come out of a girl's mouth  when she's pissed off about how the relationship's done.  There are people in my family that don't know me.  My girlfriend doesn't know me.  I come home and stare at a TV.  She wants to talk to me.  Swear to God, he has a vagina.  It is so funny.  It's the way a girl talks when the relationship isn't going well.  I don't know you.  I want to get to know you.  Why don't you open up to me?  Why don't you call me back?  Are you working on an unauthorized bio or something? 
[01:54:30]  No, it's just...  You're working on a book on the Opie and Anthony show?  No, not about the Opie and Anthony show.  You need some background?  Wait, wait, wait.  You're letting you know...  Wait, stop.  Stop.  Did you hear what you're saying?  You're working on a book?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Does that have something to do with Ant and I?  No, but it's based on characters in my life.  Holy mother of pearl.  Oh, they're in his head.  Baz, thank God you're back.  Yeah.  Thank God.  We missed you. 
[01:55:00]  Big homo.  All right.  You're turning into something that is not.  I'm not homo.  I'm not...  I'm not even going to work that angle.  No.  There's so many other ones.  I don't have a doubt.  It's just...  It's a little weird, though.  I understand that.  Guys just don't get to know other guys, really.  They just have this...  You hang out.  This unspoken thing.  When you hang out with guys, you nod.  Oh, wow.  That was a great play on the TV.  Give me another beer.  It's not like guys...  Look at the boobs on that girl.  That's guy stuff.  You're thinking of the guys that are like the guys in chick flicks, you know, that hang 
[01:55:30]  out with their friends and discuss things in depth, cry on each other's shoulders.  You want to, like, you know, start calling me on a nightly basis and start gossiping  about everyone and...  No, I don't want to bother you that way.  I mean, like...  Bother you other way.  No, once a week will be nice.  I can't talk to you once a week.  A weekly phone call.  Dude, do I call you at home once a week?  Maybe.  Maybe on a Sunday I'll be like, hey, how was your weekend?  Yeah.  You know. 
[01:56:00]  The most I hear from Ann is maybe once every two weeks.  But that's because he withdraws from people.  I withdraw myself from people.  That was a psychologist.  The reason is I have my friends.  That's it.  I'm done.  I'm done making them.  The reason is because after, you know, spending a week trying to put on a talk show like we  do, you know, the last thing I want to see is you guys.  Talk about it.  You only have seen me for a year and like two or three months.  You've known Anthony for six years.  So you've gotten to know Anthony a little bit better than me. 
[01:56:30]  I want you to know me, too.  I want you to know me.  But, but, but, Baz, I'm going out with Anthony.  I can't, I don't, like, doesn't it sound like he's trying to be like my new girlfriend?  Yeah.  I have a girlfriend already, Baz.  I'm not trying to be anything.  I just want us to be tighter friends.  If it doesn't work out, if it doesn't work out with Ant and I, I'll consider it.  I mean, what do you want me to say?  He's probably sitting home.  I can just picture it. 
[01:57:00]  It's an Opie and Spaz show.  We don't need him to make sure.  You don't need him.  If only Opie could see my hidden talent and Anthony would just disassociate himself with everybody  to the point where Opie gets fed up and he leaves and then Opie would say, Spaz, here's  this phone call.  Hello, Spaz.  It's Opie.  Anthony left.  And I want you to come on board and I want to call it the Opie and Spaz. 
[01:57:30]  Wait, no, no.  The Spaz and Opie show.  That's what I want.  He needs me.  Now, Baz, this is it.  When Ant and I go our separate ways, that's it.  I'm done.  All right.  No more radio shows.  Are you for reference?  Yeah, you can do that.  There you go.  That's why I'm playing the stock market like a crazy man.  Just in case.  I'm not saying cut Anthony off altogether.  I'm just saying just another two. 
[01:58:00]  So he can continue his friendship with Anthony, but you want to be in his life, too.  This is classic.  You didn't have another stalker working five feet from me.  I'm not stalking you.  It's just...  Stinky, Stinky just came in the studio.  Stinky, call me.  You left out, Bob.  Spaz, were you stalking this radio show before we hired you?  I actually...  I only tuned it in the day before my interview.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Hey. 
[01:58:30]  Woo.  Hey.  Woo.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  There's some great instant feedback coming in.  Mike from Queens.  Hey, Opie, can me and my girl double date with you and Spaz?  Mark from Jersey.  I think Spaz wants to hang with you guys so that you will stop making fun of him.  I think he thinks that if he becomes your friend, you will find it harder to make fun  of him.  Maybe that's it.  No.  You only know me as Spaz.  You don't know me as Kevin.  Okay, Spaz. 
[01:59:00]  So we're going to start with a little dinner tonight, right?  Dinner will be great.  Okay.  You guys want your own table?  Someone better bring the DAT recorder tonight.  We're going to get a table and I'm recording my conversation with you.  Yeah.  I have to.  Sounds going to be awkward.  Oh, Rick, you can't sit there.  Spaz has to sit there.  I know.  I don't want to sit next to you.  I want to sit across so we can play footsie.  Spaz sounds like Carl from Caddyshack.  You know, just hang out. 
[01:59:30]  You know.  Cannonball.  Cannonball.  Got that going for you.  All right.  Well, people checking in.  Oh, no.  It's the new sensitive Spaz.  Was I okay on the phone last night when you called?  Yeah, it was okay.  It was okay.  What did you expect?  I told you I was in pain.  I shared.  I told you how much pain I was in with my back, right?  There was one part of the conversation which I didn't, I thought was a little bit, you know, 
[02:00:00]  you know, uh-uh.  Oh, no.  And what part was that?  Like, like the part when I said that I'm not really that dumb.  And then, and then I, you said, okay.  And I thought, like, you were just passing it off as a meaningless comment.  But meanwhile, it, it, it was not a meaningless comment.  All right.  I, you did say, you just wanted to tell me that you weren't as dumb as everyone thinks.  Yes.  Okay.  But, you know, you just, I thought you just passed it off.  And it, it kind of got me, you know, a little, you know, a little upset, maybe thinking a little. 
[02:00:30]  And so I thought I'd approach you with it.  Is that like another April Fool's joke?  Yeah, right?  It's got to be.  You know, and it's tough because I love you so much and you don't, you don't love me.  All right.  Uh, Opie.  Yeah.  Uh, this fax just came in for my friend Joe Curry.  Yeah.  Plankfoot.  Yeah.  Uh, Ant lets me for some wine and cheese.  I think we're drifting apart.  What?  So I, thank you for, I, I think, uh, Spaz is opening up a whole new realm of sensitivity  with friends.  Know how many guys are shaking their heads out there? 
[02:01:00]  When you want to be friends with guys, it just happens.  You don't make plans.  You don't have to get too deep.  You don't call them at home, really.  Unless you say, hey, uh, hey, Opie, Bill's having a cake party Saturday.  Uh, you don't, you want to go?  Great.  You would never go to a cake party with me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Do you have any other friends besides us?  Yes, I do.  And what's his name?  All right, listen.  All right, Spaz, we'll try to be friends. 
[02:01:30]  Okay.  It'll start tonight at dinner.  That'll be cool.  All right.  We won't put, we won't put you on the, uh, at the kiddie table.  You'll sit at the big boys table, all right?  Cool.  Tom from Long Island.  Hey, Opie, bring a rubber.  And then Eric from Jersey is, is, uh, quoting me.  It says, Spaz, it's not you, it's me.  Oh.  Cranky Ass from Midtown Rides.  Cranky Ass.  Hey, Opie, will you call me tonight? 
[02:02:00]  I'd ask him, but I feel withdrawn from him.  Yeah.  Everybody's withdrawn.  Are you my pal?  Well, we also have to talk to him about, uh, why we brought him in in the first place.  Obviously, the conversations go awry when he comes in here.  Yeah.  But, uh, he had his birthday.  Was, uh, when?  Monday?  Yesterday was my birthday.  Spaz, now if you're calling me at home on your birthday, why wouldn't you share that with me?  I slipped my mind. 
[02:02:30]  You're going to send me a card?  My birthday's coming up.  I have my birthday's coming up.  I've been written down.  I just don't have your ages.  Oh, you don't want to know our ages.  What, do you want a card with the age on it?  Like, uh, you know, you, today, you're five.  I keep track, you know, I keep track of people's ages.  What?  I don't think they, why?  I don't think I know how old people are.  Oh, my God.  Well, I like to say young, because nobody's ever old.  Hallmark, Hallmark doesn't, Hallmark doesn't make cards for our ages.  Yeah.  I think they stop at 13.  So, Jerry, at 13.  And that's not anything that, like, anyone really asks or needs to know on a card. 
[02:03:00]  You just send a, if you feel like sending a birthday card, like if we knew it was your  birthday, I wouldn't be like, so you're 23, like a little handwritten, hey, 23, you know?  I mean, you just send happy birthday, Kevin, you know?  I say happy, then the age, birthday, and then I do, like, a little thing.  Like my nana.  That's what my nana would do.  What do you mean you do a little thing?  You're at 12 today.  Well, next year, you're a teenager.  What do you mean you do a little thing with the age?  I play on the age, and it depends on the age.  I play, like, a little, like, like, try to make a little joke, kind of, like. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, my.  He's got jokes.  I just try to do something, you know, to make the card live.  I think you watch Martha Stewart before you get here, don't you?  No, I don't.  Try to do something with the card.  Maybe a little play on the age.  Yeah, happy birthday, F face.  Spaz said earlier that he's working on a book.  Spaz's book title, Men Are From Mars and I Am From Venus. 
[02:04:00]  Let me tell you guys something, man.  You know, this radio show doesn't need writers like all the other top radio shows in this town.  No.  Because we have our listeners.  You guys come up with better stuff than anybody that we would hire to write this crap.  So now, we were going to talk about his birthday and what he did on his birthday.  Let's go and see it from Jersey.  Hey, yo.  Try a Let's Be Friends Vermont teddy bear.  Another one from the listeners.  You guys are the best.  Or give a bearcaster a call and get Anthony the withdrawn bear. 
[02:04:30]  So you might tell.  How would you like to move my lawn?  Huh?  Okay, terrific.  Hey.  Woo!  All right, listen.  Come in.  What starts with tonight, someone bring the tape recorder because I'm recording my conversation  with Spaz tonight.  You're not going to feel awkward if we have a dat player running.  The tape rolling.  No, but just open.  Talk.  Talk to me. 
[02:05:00]  Open up.  Talk to me.  You never talk to me.  Oh, no.  Chara.  Chara is in the studio.  I want to defend Spaz.  You want to defend Spaz?  Because he gave me a birthday card last week.  All right, last week was your birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  How old were you or you don't want to tell anyone?  I was 23.  23, okay.  So he had something cute to say about 23?  No, yeah, he was very nice.  He got me a nice Christmas card also.  He really knows how to write cards.  He's so nice.  Read the card.  You can read it. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  Can't wait for Spaz.  Spaz reading card.  Happy birthday.  Why'd you write question marks after happy?  Because that means my age.  Wait, keep reading.  Yeah, okay.  I have no clue how young you are, but you look 18.  Well, there you go.  Thank you.  I hope that you get all that you wish for on your birthday because you deserve it.  You are a fellow Aries and a friend.  Oh, very into the astrology thing.  I hope that we will remain friends for more birthdays to come. 
[02:06:00]  Stay wonderful and happy birthday, Kevin.  Wow, handwritten.  That's nice.  Are you my pal?  Well, no, that is very nice.  You're into the signs, right?  Yes, I am.  I'm a Gemini.  Yes, your birthday is in May.  I think I would say.  I know what day yours is.  May 23rd.  We make a great couple.  I don't believe in astrology, but I am, what they say about Gemini, about being like a 
[02:06:30]  psychopath and split personality and edgy and all that, it's all me.  I'm a true Aries, too.  Great.  All right, listen.  I'm going to try and ram you into, you know.  All right, man.  Yeah.  We do have to take a quick break, but.  Yeah, we got to talk about his birthday.  He went out, stayed at a hotel.  Stayed in the city.  You know how sometimes you decide to stay in the city?  And he grabbed a hotel here in the city.  You never guess which one. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  I mean.  It is a good story because I walked into the studio, like I said, about 40 minutes ago  this started, and these guys were laughing their balls off.  We just went off on a tangent here, but we have to get to the reason why we have Spaz  in the studio.  Yeah.  He spent his birthday in the city.  And spent a bloody fortune.  I guess we could say that.  Right?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have the story next.  Stay there.  You have 30 seconds to roll.  Whip on out.  Whip on out.  Whip on out.  Whip on out. 
[02:07:30]  Wow.  1-0-2-7-W-E-W.  Oh.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, Anthony.  Remember when we did the, um, we stood out in the driving range at the golf course.  We dressed up in hockey equipment and other stuff and stood out on the driving range with  about...  Would you consider this the wackiest fitness ever, though?  We try not to do wacky fitness.  This was probably one of the zaniest things we've done. 
[02:08:00]  Yes, a little wacky for us, but it was cool.  It was for, like, a charity.  You know what?  And this was before Jack asked, and we have video that they would play on MTV tomorrow  because it was pretty sick.  But I remember I was so, uh, scared of getting hit in the junk that, um, I took a big steel  frying pan and duct tape right off of my trot, and I will never forget the sound it made  and the, the, the relief I felt when one of the shots, a line shot, man, right off the  frying pan. 
[02:08:30]  Oh!  It made a bong sound.  I looked down and saw, when I had a duct tape, it hit the duct tape and made, like, a hole  in the duct tape where the golf ball hit, and it was right where my sack was.  Now, you guys don't understand how scary this was.  We were in full, like, hockey goalie gear, frying pans on our junk.  We had every inch of our body...  Right, uh, covered with chest, arms, legs, heavy, heavy pads.  We stood about 100 to 120 yards away, and we had...  Had to be 50 guys.  I was going to say, like, 40.  All right, 40 or 50 guys all hitting golf balls at the same time in us. 
[02:09:00]  And some of them real ringers.  I mean, that could slam these balls.  The line shots that just stay five feet off the ground for 200 yards.  Yeah.  All those things that just...  Woo!  And you defy gravity.  You see it coming at you, but it's coming so fast, there's no way you can move.  And it hits you, and you're just convinced you're dead.  Yeah.  No joke.  You're like, oh, my...  I'm done.  And you're amazed.  And then you're like, wow, that didn't hurt.  It's really bizarre.  The first one that hits you, you're all scared and stuff.  And then the first one that hits you, you're like, oh, wow, that didn't hurt. 
[02:09:30]  But it's going to hurt when it hits me on the kneecap.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about the ones that would just whiz by our head?  Oh, yeah.  And you would hear the sound of...  Oh, my God, it's a TIE fighter.  Yeah.  That was pretty scary, though.  Maybe we'll have to pull something wacky out like that again, Opie. 
[02:10:00]  I don't know how wacky it is, because it was really scary.  Yeah.  It was fun for the people that were doing it.  And there were times we got hit, it knocked us right over.  Like, boom, we were, you know, knocked right over.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Yeah.  We can do it again.  We did it for a charity.  It was for a good cause.  We raised a lot of money.  Yeah.  And like I said, it was fun for the people that were doing it.  I mean, if you're at a driving range, what would be more fun than aiming at people?  Yeah.  It wasn't really.  You know, who hasn't taken shots at the poor ball collector guy in the little cage golf cart? 
[02:10:30]  And remember, we started like 200 yards out.  Because even though we were like, you know, had all this padding on, we were still scared.  And then we got a little braver.  We kept moving up, moving up.  And we got about 100, 110 yards away.  It was our closest.  It was just insane.  Insane.  It's so funny when you take a shot on the, take a shot on the course and you see a ball's  going to somebody.  The poor!  Stupid thing to yell. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, how about look out!  Holy ash!  The thing's just going right for them.  And they're just standing there.  And you see the whole thing happening.  That lands a foot away from them.  They give you that what the F look.  Horrible.  They either step on your ball and hit it back to you.  Yeah.  I'm really terrible at it.  So I don't know where the ball's going.  And stop it right for us!  I don't know where it's going after I hit it.  So just say, hey, look out.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'd pay some good money to knock a few balls at you. 
[02:11:30]  That'd be hysterical.  Yeah, was it called, what was it, take a shot at Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, because we take a shot at everyone else.  Yeah, it was the gag.  Your chance to get revenge.  You could do it like, you know, 50 bucks for gay Marco.  You know, 100 bucks for stinky.  You know, 500 bucks for you guys.  Yeah, I would consider doing it again.  It was scary, but I would do it again.  And those shots, five feet off the ground, worm burners.  Yeah, I know.  Dicious.  Thanks, Jeff.  Take it easy, guys.  Okay.  Wait a second.  You mean a Boston charity actually accepted donations from your show? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  How's that for a topper?  From Cheryl.  Someone that pays attention.  Ho, ho, ho.  How's that for a topper?  Yes.  Ho, ho.  Charities usually don't take our money.  Which amazes me.  I mean, we've talked about it.  It just amazes me.  Yeah.  Anytime we try to do a charity.  You want to have free money.  We try to do a charity.  No one ever wants our money.  So screw it.  Now we just go out and have fun.  Like our road show that's coming up.  Really fast.  When we were putting out Demented World, we had to find a charity. 
[02:12:30]  And what was it?  The Jimmy Fund, Ben?  The Jimmy Fund.  Who solicits donations in movie theaters.  I mean, you'd be sitting in a movie, waiting for the movie to start.  The lights would come up.  Someone walks in front of the theater and goes,  Hi, I'm blah, blah, blah from the Jimmy Fund.  We're going to send a couple of people to walk around to guilt you  into using your remaining Jujubee money to help cure Jimmy.  Right.  So we contacted Jimmy Fund because we're in Boston.  And that's the hometown, I think, of the Jimmy Fund, right? 
[02:13:00]  All right.  Did you say Jujubee?  No, I'm going to get to the Jujubee story in a second here.  Jujubee?  Remember the Jujubee story?  It felt like a napkin.  What?  The Jujubee?  We won't say who said it, but we've got to tell the story.  Bruce Mittman, why?  All right.  Good.  So we approached the Jimmy Fund.  We're like, hey, we're going to put out this CD.  It's going to sell like hotcakes.  We're going to make a lot of money.  We'll give you, I think it was like a dollar or two bucks a CD. 
[02:13:30]  We're going to just give to the Jimmy Fund.  It's like getting 50 grand for nothing.  50?  It was over 100.  For a dollar a CD.  Yeah.  It was over 100,000 in the end.  Jimmy Fund said, no, they didn't want to take our money.  So we're sitting there like, you'd rather, you know, watch kids suffer with the cancer  and stuff than take our money.  It may take a life.  Yeah.  They proved by their actions they would rather have children suffering with cancer than  accept Opie and Anthony's money.  Over 100 grand.  Yeah.  We were just floored that they wouldn't take our money. 
[02:14:00]  So we started calling other charities in Boston.  No one would take our money.  Nope.  To make a long story short, Demented World, if you look closely on the labeling of our CD,  that's like three years old now, the charity we finally found was the Minority Homeless Veterans  Association.  Veterans Association.  Right.  Not even the homeless vets, it was the Minority Homeless Vets.  Minority Homeless Vets.  Of Boston.  Of Boston.  It's not even for New York. 
[02:14:30]  No.  They got...  There's not many minorities in Boston.  They got all the money.  They got all the money.  Because that was the only charity that would take it.  And the check presenting ceremony.  Right.  With our boss.  We didn't have to go, but yeah, we sold a ton of the CDs and it was time to, you know,  pay the Minority Homeless Veterans of Boston the big check.  The big check.  So our GM at the time, Bruce Mittman, has to go down to their local headquarters and present 
[02:15:00]  that five foot by two foot big photo op check.  Now, he was pissed off at us at the time for something.  I don't even remember.  We were getting in a lot of trouble back then.  We just never got it back then, especially.  So, we're doing our radio show and Bruce Mittman comes walking into the studio with  the big check.  And he goes, I don't know why I'm doing this for you guys, but I got to present this check  to a bunch of shwuggies.  Oh! 
[02:15:30]  Shwuggies!  When he said that, I lost it.  And the picture of the...  Good.  But here's this little Jewish guy.  I swear to God, he's three feet tall.  The picture, it's out there somewhere.  I don't think it made the main papers, but like a local paper.  Yeah.  There's a picture of our midget GM, because he was like, like Anthony said, about 5'2",  5'3", sitting there, putting on a fake smile, surrounded by a bunch of shwuggies.  Shwuggies!  As he's holding the big check.  These are like some ancient Tuskegee Airmen pilots that are just like standing there going, 
[02:16:00]  I remember back on P-51, I was in on a Mustang, went on to something, me and a squad of the  shwuggies swept down on the goddamn dragon.  I'm back there for the future.  Let me tell you about it.  We win the war.  And there's this three-foot little Jewish guy going, boys, boys, I don't know how I get  stuck presenting the check to the shwuggies, but...  The shwuggies!  I will never forget that word.  It was Boston.  Everyone talks about that. 
[02:16:30]  Screen name up for grabs today.  Shwuggie.  Shwuggie.  Shwuggie.  I don't even know how do you spell Shwuggie.  Boys, boys, my shwuggies.  That guy was classic, man.  Let me tell you something, I remember a storm on the beaches.  The guy would just like, we'd have these just rocking shows with corn and Limp Bizkit.  He'd be backstage smoking pot with us.  This guy was the most like business guy, but he was a midget. 
[02:17:00]  And he drove this big friggin' suburban.  He had the biggest car in Boston.  Because he was so short.  And we used to joke on the air that he needed a stepladder to get into it and stuff.  Yeah, you'd see the door open and one of those rope ladders unroll.  No joke, because he looked ridiculous behind the wheel of this truck.  Yeah, and then at the shows, because we used to do a lot of the parties with the bands and stuff up there.  Corn-plated a few and stuff.  And there's Brucie just partying it up like a madman with everybody. 
[02:17:30]  Hey, boys, how you doing?  Any pot boys?  Boys.  That's what he calls boys.  B-b-b-b-boys.  Boys.  Have you seen Ozone?  I need some pot boys.  Boys.  He lived in the nicest town.  Yeah, he lived in a really like snootin', highfalutin' area where there were no shwuggies at all.  No.  No shwuggies.  Here he is.  Ooh!  Ooh!  I'll never forget him walking into that studio that day with a big check. 
[02:18:00]  I've got to present this check to the shwuggies.  The shwuggies.  Is that horrid?  He sounds like Ted Knight.  Boy.  He definitely sounds like Ted Knight.  We've got to bring it to the shwuggies.  Right.  Is that clear?  Carl, what's up?  Hey, I know where the term four came from.  I don't know about shwuggie, but I can tell you where four came from.  Yeah.  He used to work at a golf course during college with this old Scottish guy who's kind of like that McTavish from Caddyshack. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  He says the Scots used to have these battles.  No, you're a geek!  That's right.  You know, that gopher, gopher, Danny.  Ah!  They used to fire cannons when they'd fight between the clans, and before they'd shoot them, they'd yell before the cannon.  So the guy's a duck.  After a while, they'd get tired of yelling before the cannons.  They just said, four of the cannons.  And then finally they said four, then they'd stop shooting at each other and start playing golf and yell four.  So not a lot of yucks, but that's exactly what it's called.  How about that? 
[02:19:00]  You know, in those days, they called it golf without the L.  Golf without the L.  I haven't seen that movie in two weeks.  It was given to me by the Knights of St. Andrews.  But I got it from a Negro.  I got it from a shwuggie.  It looks like I'm a rat.  It's in the hole!  Let's go to Steve.  A lot of Steve's checking in today.  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm laughing my ass off over here.  The proper pronunciation for that word, the Yiddish derivative of that is shwuggie. 
[02:19:30]  Shwuggie?  Yeah, yeah.  Shwuggie.  But he would be shwuggie.  Shwuggie.  Shwuggie, yeah.  It's a Yiddish word.  Basically, the best interpretation, it means shadow.  It's a slang word for black men.  I've got to give this big check, boys, to the shadows.  Yeah, you guys are a little picked ass.  The shwuggies.  You know, we never told that story on the air.  He goes, Bruce, he was unbelievable.  Yeah, because here we are doing a nice thing for the minority homeless vets of Boston. 
[02:20:00]  What about the time we had a meet with the gay guys?  We had a meeting with three guys from the gay, lesbian, you know, GLAAD or whatever.  And because of some of the gay-oriented things we were doing on the show.  What gay bit?  Oh, I know what gay bit.  Can we play the bit?  Which one was it?  Hi, Mom, I'm gay.  Hi, Mom, I'm gay.  All right, hold on.  Mom, I'm a rope-swallower.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By O.P. and Anthony.  Surfing New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island. 
[02:20:30]  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  Okay, where were we?  Talking about, I don't know how we got on that, but talking about our old GM, Brucey Mittman.  And all the meetings we used to have to take with certain groups back when we were up in Boston.  The Fagolas, the Shwoogies, all the groups.  Behind closed doors, though, it was hilarious.  The fact that we needed, the only charity we could find was the minority homeless veterans of Boston to give money to. 
[02:21:00]  There's no one else, the Jimmy Fund didn't want our money, didn't want our stinking money to help kids with cancer.  They'll solicit movie theaters so you could throw your popcorn money into a can.  But they didn't want $100,000 from Opium Anthony.  Blood money.  Like taking it from a terrorist.  So, yeah, we got the minority homeless vets of Boston on board. 
[02:21:30]  And when we finally got the money to give them from CD sales, a substantial sum, we sent our GM over there.  We were busy that day to give them the big check, the big photo op check.  Hey, look at that.  And he said, there's a shot of us in our little goalie gear.  Oh, yeah, let me see that.  On the inside cover of the Menoworld.  Let's see those pictures.  And he said, why do I have to go and give the check to the shwoogies? 
[02:22:00]  The shwoogies.  Shwoogies.  After we were on the air, you know, telling everyone how nice we were and how cool we are  because we were raising money for the minority homeless vets.  And then behind closed doors, he was pissed.  That's right.  He had to deliver the check to the shwoogies.  Yeah, there we are in our hockey outfit with the frying pan.  Let's see.  You can see the frying pan taped to my crotch area.  All right.  Anyway.  Anthony, I remembered the third story, by the way.  Oh, you did? 
[02:22:30]  Two words.  What?  Cancer kids.  Oh, no.  Not a funny story, but we'll explain in a minute.  God.  First, we had...  It was Bruce Mittman's idea of getting us out of some serious trouble.  Yeah.  Go hang out with cancer kids.  That'll make everyone love us.  See?  If we have a photo op and use poor children.  Hold on.  Go to the gay thing first, and then we'll get into cancer kids.  Well, we were... 
[02:23:00]  We'll finish up the segment on our old GM, Bruce Mittman, the midget.  And we did...  We did Hi, Mom, I'm Gay.  Simple game.  A guy calls up his mother and says that he's gay.  It's harmless.  Let me play it.  Okay.  And then we'll tell you what happened after this aired in Boston.  Right.  All right, Bob.  Are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm Gay?  Absolutely.  Totally.  Now, I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Ever.  Are you gay? 
[02:23:30]  No rope swallowing.  All right, Bob, let's give it a shot.  All right.  You got to try to convince her, man.  All right, I'll be right back.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Hello?  Mom, can you hear me down?  Yeah.  It's Bobby.  Bobby?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah, well, you sound awful funny.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Hey, Mom, you sitting down?  Why?  I got to tell you something.  What?  Don't get nervous. 
[02:24:00]  That's what might be me that I tell you.  I was going to tell you when you called earlier today.  Yeah?  I'm gay.  Oh, you're full of s***.  I'm a twinkie.  I swear it.  Bobby, will you stop it?  You know, I have enough aggravation.  What?  How come you never believe me?  Because I don't believe you.  Why?  Well, you just had a child, Bobby.  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but...  Bobby.  What?  Are you trying to be funny? 
[02:24:30]  I'm not.  I got to tell you, you know, I just don't feel right.  I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Bobby, are you with Donna?  Not at the moment.  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  Hey, you can tell your father that.  I'm not even going to bring it up.  All right.  You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people.  So what's the, you know, what's all of a sudden?  Well, it was to throw everyone off, you know?  Bobby, I don't believe it.  However, you know...  You still love me?  I've had enough heartache.  I think, you know...  You still love me? 
[02:25:00]  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh?  Bobby, what the hell are you doing?  Drinking?  No.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No.  I was going to spring it on him tonight.  Yeah, that's nice.  Yeah, you do that.  Stand a long distance away, will you?  I will.  Out of arms reach.  Bobby, don't give me that balloon, please.  You break my heart when you do things like this.  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  All right.  All right.  I love you. 
[02:25:30]  See you later.  I love you, too.  Okay.  Holy Jesus.  Dude.  I got to get back there quick, man.  She's going to put a knife on her wrist.  You better do that.  Hey, Bob.  Yeah.  Bob, I'm gay.  I'm gay.  That sounds like the manliest dude around.  I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, Bob.  I'm gay.  That'll explain the rough throat.  Yeah, I'm a twinkie, Bob.  That's a twinkie.  That's how I got the throat is bad, Bob. 
[02:26:00]  And there you have it.  Hi, Mom, I'm gay.  Mom, darling.  Mom, Bobby.  It's Bobby.  It's Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  All right.  So we played Hi, Mom, I'm gay.  And all of a sudden, a bunch of gay guys, this organization, comes out of the woodwork saying,  do you know how difficult it is for a guy to come out of the closet?  This should not be made fun of.  It's a very tough time for them to tell their parents.  And you're making light of it.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Give me a big C.  So if that happened down here, our boss would say, go F yourself. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  They would say that.  Right.  What's up there?  No.  Yeah.  They folded and they set up a meeting.  They set up a meeting between these gay guys.  Gay guys.  Yeah.  And us.  Hey.  In the boss's office.  Hey.  I have the boss sat there.  And the boss in front of everybody is like, we have to meet with the gay, lesbian alliance 
[02:27:00]  of whatever.  And then we get behind the closed doors and it's like, all right, how long is this going  to last?  He goes, I don't know.  The faggot isn't here yet.  He should be arriving shortly.  I'm sure the queer isn't going to take up much of your time, boys.  The homo faggot queer should be leaving well before showtime, boys.  So then you fast forward another half hour and we're now in the boss's office with the  gay guys.  The gay guys.  And the boss with his arms folded looking at us like he's pissed.  Yeah.  So he's got to look like he's all aggravated with us as the gay guys. 
[02:27:30]  And we're sitting there like, you son of a bitch.  Ten minutes ago, you're calling them faggots.  The gay guys are handing us pamphlets and books.  Dittos.  Dittos.  All kinds of reading material about how hard it is to come out of the closet.  Remember, they wanted us to read a book.  I forgot, but it was like Bernie's story.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was about him coming out of the closet.  That's a book.  We're like, we're not reading a book.  Like, do you think we're going to read this?  Oh, do you think we're actually going to sit and read this?  But we were just sitting there all dopey. 
[02:28:00]  Okay, yeah, we'll go through this.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  And finally, we just said, look, we've got to go.  Finally.  And Bruce, he gets up.  Thank you so much for enlightening us on the trials and tribulations of homosexuality  and the various hardships one must endure.  And the boys are now more sensitive.  I believe they're more educated.  Thanks for coming by and enlightening my boys.  Okay, goodbye.  Okay, the bunghole pirate's gone, boys. 
[02:28:30]  You can now go back on the air.  Please lay off the fags today.  Maybe hit the shwoogies.  You know, you boys are never in trouble with the spics.  I'm very proud.  Boy.  Mick, what's going on?  Yeah, you guys got this guy on tape.  I've got to hear this guy's voice now.  The guy did our show a couple times in New York.  In New York, when we first got here, he came into New York to do some business,  and we had him on the air.  And they're going, how are my boys?  I wish I would have heard it. 
[02:29:00]  We'll try to dig up some tape on him.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right, buddy.  Bye.  Boy, some gooks are calling, complaining about some of your various Asian bits.  You know, as we were kind of getting our thoughts together during commercials,  and I'm thinking about it, and things are coming back to my memory that I blocked out.  Because this was just one of those things that I didn't want to be part of.  It was horrible.  We walked out.  We walked out.  We did walk out.  After they brought Billy.  Little Billy. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  All right.  Little Billy.  Stop it.  We showed we had hearts that day.  Oh, we finally reached our limit.  Boys.  Like, boys, boys.  He was always trying to run block for us in his own inimitable little way, the little midget.  And it would be all PC in front of the person.  But then he'd turn around and, you know, call them shwuggies or faggots.  The faggots have left, boys.  You can resume bashing the faggots. 
[02:30:00]  Well, we finally come to the famous prank.  Yeah, when we did that mayor thing, said the mayor was dead, and we were on the verge of getting fired.  We didn't get fired that day.  It went a good week before they actually fired us.  So in that week, Brucie is trying to do damage control.  Now, it's not working.  The mayor was so pissed off.  But they came up with this idea.  Well, you've got to tell everyone that they hired a PR firm. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, they hired a PR firm just for this, to try to make us look good.  To make us look good and put out the fire so we could keep our jobs and continue rocking walls.  Now, if you remember, Opie, when we got in trouble, Brucie and Dada Dave got together  and decided that they were going to approach the mayor, Mayor Menino, and say,  look, the same mayor that we just told everyone died in a car accident, April Fool's.  Look, we'll go into Boston, put the boys in those stocks, those old stocks where you put 
[02:31:00]  your head and your arms through and you're locked in there, and the mayor that we said  was dead will throw pies at the boys' face.  And everything will be okay after that.  And then that's fine.  This is the idea that Dada Dave came up with.  So that's all okie-dokie.  He told the midget, look, I can handle this.  I've got a great way to get us out of this.  Great way to get us out of trouble.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  We had news crews camping outside our residence.  Yeah.  And this is going to take care of it. 
[02:31:30]  Just a bunch of our listeners and the mayor throwing pies at our faces.  We're in a stockade.  So get to this.  Get this.  Before they even check with the mayor or us or anything, Dada Dave goes and orders about  500 pies.  500 big cream pies.  Real pies.  Not whipped cream and tinfoil pie tints.  Real pies.  He wanted us to get hurt.  They were like big lemon meringue pies, apple pies.  The reason why the old pie gag works is because all it is is whipped cream.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  But he, no, real pies.  He's going to throw real pies at us.  500 pies he orders.  So now we get on the air when we find out about this.  Yeah, go ahead.  The next day.  I just got to jump in.  Because we didn't really get fired April 1st.  We did the show.  We were on the next day.  April 2nd.  April 2nd.  We start getting wind of this pie scheme.  So we go off and say, we're not doing this.  We are not going to go in stocks and have pies thrown at us by anybody.  Dave comes running in all pissed off. 
[02:32:30]  You don't tell me what you're going to do.  I'm trying to get damage control here.  This is off the air.  He starts yelling at us.  I'm trying to help you guys out and do damage control.  You don't get on the air and say you're not doing that.  And you're so tame.  Oh, he was screaming.  You don't do that with me.  Because I said so.  All raging pissed off.  500 pies he was.  It was Davey.  It was Davey Dearest.  Davey Dearest. 
[02:33:00]  Because he was screaming there.  You'll get hit with these pies.  Because he was screaming in that same cadence.  Yeah.  Brucey, get the pie.  And you know what, Ant?  I have that audio on it, Dad, somewhere.  And to this day, I cannot find it.  And it drives me nuts.  Probably the most valuable piece of tape since the Nixon Watergate tape.  Without a doubt.  And I will find it eventually.  Yeah.  But before you move on with the story.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Now, if we back up here.  We told you guys that they hired a PR firm, right?  Mm-hmm.  The midget, Bruce Mittman, who loves the shruggy so much.  Boys, boys.  Remember what he did to the mayor?  He looked up the mayor's schedule.  Yeah.  Because it was all about damage control and then putting out the fires.  So Bruce Mittman figures if he could get a picture of himself shaking the mayor's hand.  Oh, right.  Because what the PR firm does is they have their...  No, this is a true story.  They have their own camera crew and stuff. 
[02:34:00]  So they'll go to events, take pictures, and then they'll put it in the paper.  This story was so hot, it was...  He hired basically a paparazzi.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, any paper in the New England area would buy this photo of the general manager  of the station that just pulled the most amazing, sickest, ridiculous prank shaking the mayor's hand.  Uh-huh.  It was gold.  So, freaking the midget finds out the mayor's schedule.  I'm looking up the mayor's schedule, boys.  I will fix this for you. 
[02:34:30]  The fat Dago will be very happy.  So he camps out where the mayor's going to do an appearance or whatever, whatever he's  doing.  I forget exactly.  Mm-hmm.  The mayor comes out of his little meeting.  There's Bruce Mittman, runs right up to him.  And there's the paparazzi.  Yeah.  Even though it was a PR firm, but it was a paparazzi guy going, kick, kick, kick, kick,  kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick,  snapping pictures like crazy.  Yes, it was in all the Boston papers the next day.  Yeah.  Bruce Mittman shaking the hand of the mayor. 
[02:35:00]  Which infuriated the mayor.  Infuriated.  Because the mayor had no idea who the midget was.  He thought he was just shaking a, you know, just a regular schmose hand.  He thought I was welcoming him to Munchkinland, boys, boys, boys.  So that infuriated the mayor as well.  So then, so now they finally check.  Dada Dave now calls the mayor's office and says, I have 500 pies.  I have the boys.  We're going to do this, right?  And the mayor's office just goes, are you out of your effing mind? 
[02:35:30]  Do you think we're just going to take our anger with them and what they did and how they  hurt the mayor's family and turn it into some wacky radio stunt prank thing?  No, take your pies and shove them up your ass.  That's pretty much what they said.  Yeah.  So now, 500 pies ordered.  Opie and Anthony in trouble.  Damage control not working.  PR firm, PR firm phase two now. 
[02:36:00]  Right.  Okay, we'll take lemons, make lemonade.  We got 500 pies.  What can we do with 500 pies?  We'll send Opie and Anthony to the children's cancer hospital to deliver the pies to the  little dying children.  Like that's what.  A great photo effing op mother effer.  That's, that, yeah, that's what dying kids want.  Pies.  So now we're going to use kids with cancer to try to make it so O and A can keep their  goddamn jobs.  Right.  And we were so, you know, we got to say it. 
[02:36:30]  We were so shell shocked.  We kind of just went with it.  Dude, we were going wherever they said at that point.  We were just, what?  Yeah.  We've, okay, every, every hour they're running promos on the news and the updates on where  we are, what we're doing.  How does the mayor feel?  When are they going to get fired?  Are they fired?  Who knows?  This is our lives.  And we're, we're just like freaking out.  We were like Stepford DJs.  We were just like, oh, okay.  All right.  Whatever.  And we really didn't know what they were doing.  They go, just be at this hospital at this time.  There's going to be a photographer there.  So we're like, okay, they didn't tell us about the cancer hospital. 
[02:37:00]  I think, all right, there's a kid with a broken leg.  We'll shove a pie in his arm and we'll leave.  Right.  I don't know.  We go there.  This stuff is done all the time, by the way, by these PRs.  Oh, yeah.  When you see some schlep jock standing there with, you know, hugging little crack babies,  you think he wakes up and goes, well, I think I'm going to go hug some crack babies today.  No, that guy has a story to tell.  He's trying to get himself out of some trouble.  Right.  So in most cases, I'm sure there's good-hearted souls.  We go to this hospital. 
[02:37:30]  There's the truck, 500 pies in the truck.  And they start bringing them in.  They start bringing in the pies.  We're in the lobby of the hospital.  Now, the people that worked at the cancer hospital, they didn't know the whole story.  They really didn't know who we were at this point.  No.  They really thought that you and I and the radio station was doing a good deed.  That's all they knew at first.  Now we're standing around waiting for the photographers.  Right.  And they got the pies just loaded all the way up to the ceiling.  Pies.  As far as the photo op goes, it was quite impressive. 
[02:38:00]  So now they go, okay, let's start bringing the children in.  Right.  All right.  So like I said, kid with a broken leg.  At this point, we still think it's just a regular, oh, look at that.  Little Mary just got her tonsils taken out.  How cute.  Hopefully you can enjoy the lemon meringue.  But you can't eat the crust.  Your throat still hurts.  They start wheeling out kids with the clumps of hair coming out.  The baldy heads. 
[02:38:30]  Look.  Look.  Dude.  We're not telling the story for a joke.  No, this is what happened.  So I'm looking at Oprah like, oh, my God, these are dying kids.  No, no, no, no, no.  But I got it back.  We did not know at first.  We're still thinking, well, okay, they're in bed shape.  No, I'm looking, and in my head, I'm thinking, oh, my God, they're dying kids.  I'll tell you when I found out.  When?  All of a sudden, even though this was like April 5th or so, okay, all the kids are around the pie stacked up to the ceiling.  We're still waiting for the photographer.  That was the reason we waited for them all. 
[02:39:00]  And all of a sudden, there's little Mary looking just like Cindy Lou Who, and she's like the leader of the cancer kids.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, they're like little impish little kid, short, little cute kid, still cute, okay?  And you look at her, you're like, oh, it doesn't seem like anything's wrong with her.  And they go, Mary, why don't you sing a song?  You think the rendition of Ziggy doing Silent Night is beautiful? 
[02:39:30]  This girl, like an angel.  And all the cancer kids joining in, right?  The kid choir?  Hey, hey, hey, it's the cancer kids.  It was a cancer kid choir, yes, right?  So she's like in this voice from heaven.  And I'm really getting into it.  I'm like, wow, that's kind of cool, you know? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  All of a sudden, one of the helpers, the nurses, whatever, bends over to me and whispers in my ear, goes, you know, Mary's not going to see Christmas.  No.  Because it was April, all right?  What happened?  I was just talking to her.  She was just singing.  You're kidding.  Mary's not going to see Christmas.  So I look at it.  I think at this point, seriously, I turn white as a ghost, like, what the F are we doing here?  Yeah, they're there.  And now all the cancer kids are looking at Aunt and I like we're heroes because we brought all these pies. 
[02:40:30]  We brought a bunch of pies.  And we're like, we're not this nice.  We're not nice.  We're not doing this out of the kindness of our hearts.  We're using these kids.  We were thrown into the situation, did not know, and they think we're heroes.  And we're like, we are scumbags.  To use kids like this to try to save our necks, the station puts this goddamn thing together.  Now we're still waiting for the photographer.  Right.  And then the nurses go. 
[02:41:00]  And I don't mean to laugh.  I'm laughing because I'm uncomfortable because I don't want to be known as a dick for this story because this is an insane story.  The nurses go, okay, why don't we get Billy?  So it's like, well, why isn't Billy here with the rest of the kids?  Why don't Billy just get wheeled out or walk out or use the crutches and come out with the rest of the kids?  Why don't we get Billy?  It was sort of like, get the gimp, the gimp sleep.  No, no.  He was the only kid that wasn't there. 
[02:41:30]  We're like, why isn't Billy there?  Suddenly I hear a low hum down the hallway.  Here comes Billy's electric.  It wasn't even a wheelchair.  I don't know what this was.  It was a rolling platform.  It was like a wheelchair with just a head hooked up to tubes and wires and other devices to keep little Billy alive.  And the reason he didn't join the kids in the beginning, the cancer kids, is because basically, you know, he only can muster up enough energy to maybe be awake for five minutes. 
[02:42:00]  He's like your cell phone's NICAD.  You know?  Stop it!  You don't want to keep it on all the time.  You just want to turn it on when you've got to use it or the battery will not.  Now they bring, uh, yeah, they wheel little Billy in.  Billy down the hall.  Now it's complete.  The smile on the kid's face, I'm like, holy, uh, at this point we're like, so you've got to go through it.  Well, the photographers get there.  And, uh, me and Opie start having a conference.  We're like, this is the wrongest thing. 
[02:42:30]  We have never done anything so wrong.  Because on the radio when you're talking, yeah, we say stuff that's really off the wall and wrong.  But then to just be directly involved in something like this, they are using the dying children to take a photo op with us to try to, in some way, spin it in the paper that we're good guys.  Right.  And should keep our job.  Right.  So we just turned around and said, no, this ain't it.  And, uh, we walked.  Walked. 
[02:43:00]  Took our pies, too.  Little kids didn't get it.  No.  We left the pies.  And the kids didn't know we walked.  We were like, no, no, we were like, here you go.  We're presenting these pies.  Yeah.  And that was all fine and well.  But, uh, it was so depressing.  And then we were so friggin' pissed at them for putting us in this position at, uh, management and the PR firm that we just went, you know something, you guys do whatever you want.  We're not doing another thing.  If we get fired, we get fired.  F it. 
[02:43:30]  And they got mad at us because we walked.  Because we walked.  We missed the little photo op to use the dying children to try to save our necks.  That's like just gunfire breaks out.  You pick up little Billy's head and try to block the shots.  That's what it was like.  What?  It was.  Little Billy's still alive, by the way.  He's on the phone.  Billy.  Ooh.  Ooh.  It was horrible.  It was.  And, of course, the story ends.  We did get fired.  And that was the best thing that ever happened. 
[02:44:00]  And we took it.  Best thing that ever happened.  Boys, boys, I'll try to hire you back, boys.  Why didn't you take pictures with the cancer kids, boys?  Boys, why not take pictures with those little dying craps?  Proofy.  All right, cool.  Let's, uh, let's try to end on an up note.  Too late.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll be back in just a bit.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:44:30]  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W. </pre>
