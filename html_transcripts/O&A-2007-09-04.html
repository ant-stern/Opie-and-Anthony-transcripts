<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast begins with the hosts returning from vacation, making light of their controversial reputation.  Their initial conversation is a rambling discussion of recent events, including a dismissive mention of Hurricane Katrina and the Red Sox World Series win.  This segues into a scathing critique of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon, mocking its outdated format, Ed McMahon's declining health, and the perceived disparity between corporate donations and actual impact on muscular dystrophy.  They play clips highlighting McMahon's awkwardness and mention Jerry Lewis's use of homophobic slurs.  The hosts then speculate about Lewis's health and the telethon's future.

A substantial portion of the show is dedicated to the Larry Craig sex scandal, with graphic descriptions of the police sting operation and the alleged "signals" used for soliciting sex in men's restrooms. The hosts use explicit language and detail gleaned from online sources to describe gay sex practices in public restrooms.

The show then shifts to the news that Jimmy's book has been banned from a Mississippi library, and they discuss a billboard featuring Jimmy partially nude.  They briefly touch on a potential Led Zeppelin reunion, speculating about the band members' current abilities, with Opie adding a personal anecdote about meeting Robert Plant. A staff member's "huge announcement" is teased but left unresolved at the end of this segment.

A later segment includes a live recording of Robert Plant singing "Whole Lotta Love," which the hosts vehemently criticize using vulgar language. This transitions into a discussion about a legal dispute concerning the use of a Fox News sound effect ("stinger").  They receive a phone call from Eric Logan, their XM Satellite Radio boss, who explains Fox's request to cease using the sounder and his attempts to mediate the situation. The conversation includes jokes about Logan's alleged bathroom habits and a conspiracy theory about a cover-up between Fox and XM.

Other segments feature a humorous overreaction to a minor shark sighting, promotion of a staff member's comedy show, and a game where the hosts and listeners guess which staff member is associated with various (often sexually suggestive and crude) vacation anecdotes. This section also includes extended mockery of a Miss Teen South Carolina's geography answer and a comedic bit about a seminar on gay bathroom sex. Eric Logan is the only guest besides the hosts and staff.

A further segment focuses on a staff member's trip to Niagara Falls (treated humorously as a foreign country),  more staff vacation misadventures (including a possible photo of an underage girl), and celebrity gossip, particularly about Owen Wilson's alleged drug use and salacious details of Paula Zahn's purported extramarital affair from a tell-all manuscript. The hosts rib Kenny about his Niagara Falls trip, speculate crudely about staff members' actions, and share increasingly explicit details about Paula Zahn's affair. The arrest of a Disney employee for child pornography is also discussed. The segment concludes with continued discussion of Paula Zahn, mention of upcoming live broadcasts, and complaints about technical difficulties in their new XM studio, which was promised but not ready upon their return from vacation.

A significant segment is dedicated to "Electric Eel Entertainment," a pay service providing pre-recorded outrageous phone calls and guest appearances. The hosts suspect a caller of promoting the service.  The discussion then touches upon on-demand programming, leading to the playback and analysis of numerous clips from Electric Eel's demo reel, showcasing fabricated calls with shocking, offensive, and sexually explicit content, including references to child exploitation and sexual acts with elderly women. The hosts react with varying degrees of shock, disgust, and amusement.  Howard Stern is frequently referenced, specifically a "Queefer girl" segment. The hosts highlight the deceptive nature of these calls and the service's intention to create controversy. This section also includes discussion of a New York Post article about Howard Sternâ€™s dentures,  a Monica Lewinsky/Bill Clinton song parody, and a previously created song, "Hey Masturbator," along with a clip from a comedy bit by former colleague Rocko, focusing on a letter to a sponsored child.

The final segment includes a story about Rocko, a significantly overweight former colleague, destroying Opie's TV.  They discuss finding old videos of Rocko's show, promising hilarious content.  The hosts then delve into a listener's disastrous blind date story involving the exposure of a penis, leading to more crude jokes.  One host recounts kissing a man and the ensuing humor. The hosts reminisce about Rocko's radio show antics, including excessive food orders, yelling at interns, taping his breaks, and giving away a car. A "100 grand bit" is mentioned. The segment also includes Goo Goo Dolls music, discussion of a "line of the day" contest, mention of Jim Norton as an upcoming guest, jokes about their exhaustion, and mention of Dave Douglas's firing (in which the hosts played a role) and Ozone, a former colleague who owns a Miami Beach restaurant.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We are being held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on. 
[00:00:30]  I can't believe he said that.  Opie and Anthony.  Catch all the baseball.  Oh, nice.  Oh, that was him.  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst show I've seen.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the roll.  On the roll.  I'm glad we didn't fix that during the week that we're off.  Good morning, mother effers.  How are you?  Good morning.  All back.  Look at us.  All refreshed.  But how do they know we're back?  Because you have to say the date.  All right.  What's the date today?  That way everyone knows we're live. 
[00:01:30]  November 2nd, 2004.  No.  What?  What happened?  That isn't the date.  This is not the best of.  And I hope it never is because now people will be confused.  Happy birthday to Roger Clemens.  He's 40 years old today.  Shut up.  What?  What happened?  No.  No.  Well, it's Tuesday.  Congratulations to the Red Sox winning their first World Series.  Wait a minute.  What?  What happened?  It's not.  In many, many years. 
[00:02:00]  No.  Big day for Boston today.  We're live.  What?  Stop it.  People are going to tune out and go,  Bando.  They said they were going to be back.  Very exciting day.  We're going to find out if OJ actually killed those people.  Wow.  They're really going back.  All right.  All right.  Dewey beats Truman.  All right.  All right.  Let's get serious here for a moment.  Can you believe it was Kristen who shot him?  I have no idea. 
[00:02:30]  Come on.  Looking at the news,  there's some dumb little hurricane off the coast.  I don't know.  Hurricane Katrina or something.  Doesn't look like it's going to amount to much.  Look at that vegetable, Terry Schiavo.  Can't believe she's still alive.  I wonder.  I wonder what she's going to be like in a few years.  Of course.  Come on.  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  September.  Which means it's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Fourth. 
[00:03:00]  September 4th.  1999.  2007.  Is it really September 4th?  That's what the prep says.  Didn't we go away?  Boy.  September just went.  Flew by.  What is it now?  October?  Well.  That stupid sun knows what it's doing.  I'll tell you that much.  I know.  Anyone else notice it got a lot colder as soon as Labor Day hit?  What's that about?  It just knows.  Creepy.  It just knows when one day to the next.  August to September. 
[00:03:30]  All of a sudden it's more shadowy.  Yeah.  It's dark.  And then I was.  And the humidity drops.  And then I'm going to bed.  I'm like.  It's dark out.  What happened?  It was nice and light out.  When we got here it was light.  When I went to bed it was light out.  Now it's back to living like a goddamn vampire.  I spent one night of the vacation just looking at prostitutes and I swear I was going home.  It was six in the morning.  I'm like.  You know what?  It's getting darker a lot later. 
[00:04:00]  Just looking.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're back from vacation.  Our phone number is 877-212-O-N-A.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  What else is it?  It's Palmer Tuesday.  It's Far Away Phone Call Tuesday.  It's Door is a Jar Tuesday.  No.  We got rid of that one.  We did.  Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday.  Or Wake Up Your Spouse.  Yes.  And it's Make Up Stuff Tuesday as well.  It's E-Rock's Crappy Pixelated Camera Tuesday. 
[00:04:30]  E-Rock.  Three times.  Huh?  Three times.  I don't know.  We have so much to talk about that we don't even know where to begin.  To be honest with you.  Ant and I were just riffing on the Jerry Lewis telethon in the office.  We didn't even know that it was happening.  Put it to bed.  Everyone does know.  No one knew it was happening this year.  It was one of those things when you were growing up, especially, I was going to say 
[00:05:00]  especially in the New York area, but that's kind of dumb.  Yeah, no.  It was just one of those things like back in the, I guess, late, mid to late 70s or throughout  kind of the 80s.  People knew it was on at least.  Pushing into the 90s a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe.  This thing is still going on.  This is a mastodon stuck in a tar pit just waiting for the trunk end to sink.  Yeah.  There is nothing left of this.  It is a prehistoric, dated blast from the past that should just be put to sleep. 
[00:05:30]  I was trying to find some clips to show Anthony because Ed McMahon, who's pretty much a walking  corpse at this point, him going back and forth with Jerry Lewis, I was mesmerized.  Some witty repartee back and forth, I bet.  I was trying to find some golf yesterday, just mellow out.  Got back from vacation a day early, and I wanted to sit around and just watch a little 
[00:06:00]  golf, right?  And I'm flipping through the channels.  I'm like, oh my God, the Jerry Lewis telethon.  So I took a peek, and Ed McMahon talking to Jerry Lewis, I thought it was an SNL skit.  I really thought, you ever watch TV and you know it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed  to be what it is?  Yeah.  And you start thinking, I think this could easily just be thrown on SNL as a skit.  Yeah.  Without anyone imitating these people.  Ed McMahon actually introduced the chairman of MDA, Jerry Lewis, to Jerry Lewis. 
[00:06:30]  There was one point he was introducing the next guest to Jerry Lewis, which would be Jerry  Lewis.  Jerry, here's Jerry.  Here's the chairman of the MDA, Jerry Lewis.  And that sucks, because Ed McMahon made his bones as an announcer, you know?  Yeah.  That's what he did.  And now he can't even talk.  His voice cracks a lot.  And he had a little, he had slossy.  He had sloppy, like loose denture. 
[00:07:00]  I was going to say sloshy jaw.  Loose dentures that he's trying to hold in with his tongue.  My Effortent doesn't last as long as we're on, Jerry.  And speaking of Effortent, their check for $2 billion.  And we were also talking about how the corporations, these, see, they set records every year.  And God bless them.  They made another, they made them another $63 million, you know.  I mean, what are we doing for, the last charity we did, we raised a few hundred thousand dollars  for a hurricane Katrina victim. 
[00:07:30]  But here's the deal.  We're doing as much as they are.  They've done nothing for the lumps in five years.  Right, nothing.  They're still sitting in the chair, their legs rolling up like the Wicked Witch under the  house.  It's not doing anything.  But the thing is, people contributing aren't, isn't the reason that there's so much money  going in and they're setting records every year.  It's all the corporations out there.  Corporations.  And they're so afraid to be that corporation that goes, all right, look, we're pulling out 
[00:08:00]  this year.  Look, man, we've been giving money for 30 years.  Disease is, you know, times are tight.  The disease isn't getting cured.  So you get the same guy that comes up, uh, Jerry, here's a check from the McDonald's  Corporation for a $600 billion, billion dollars.  Jesus Christ.  Do you know what we can do with this one?  We can open up a door.  God, I could have bought 10 more mansions for myself.  I can't believe I didn't get a bonus this year because we, yes, Jerry, $600 billion from 
[00:08:30]  the McDonald's Corporation.  Here's the giant check.  I hope you go effing choke on it.  No, I hope the kids, for your kids, Jerry.  And it's like, hi, uh, well, General Electric, Jerry, would like to contribute, um, $60 billion  to, oh my God, we had to lay off 18,000 people.  We had to lay off 18,000 people because we couldn't afford it.  Because we don't want to be the one that, because we can't pull out of the goddamn Jerry 
[00:09:00]  Lewis telethon.  We want to, we don't want to be the first one to acknowledge that this is going to take  a while.  Big front page.  McDonald's doesn't contribute crap, leaves kids in wheelchairs.  Right.  You know, they don't want to do that.  So, Jerry, to you and your kids, we like to contribute.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there was people shooting themselves in the boardroom last week when we looked over  the bottom line, but here's $160 billion.  I'm still wondering where our donation went from last year.  Where the hell did that go, Jerry?  Huh? 
[00:09:30]  What'd you do?  Where'd it go?  Can that kid walk?  No.  Can you please tell us where our donation, that big donation, went from last year?  $160 billion.  The kid's still in a chair.  Oh, he's got a better chair.  You can work it with a joystick now.  That's fantastic.  It's just a dated thing, too.  I threw in Jerry Lewis for the hell of it into, you know, break.com.  And just to look at it, because I was trying to show Anthony this clip. 
[00:10:00]  If someone has it, please send it in.  It's Ed McMahon introducing, like I said, Jerry Lewis to Jerry Lewis.  And then the banter back and forth with these two guys, wow, was just brutal to watch.  And I'm trying to find the clip, and I'm seeing old clips of the Jerry Lewis telethon when he was young and vibrant.  Oh, yeah.  Like, back 85, they had some clips.  And he's hanging with Sammy Davis Jr.  He's got his greasy black hair, jet black dyed hair or whatever the hell it was.  No, he really did stay up the whole time, and he was drinking martinis during commercial. 
[00:10:30]  And that's when it was on for, like, you know, the whole weekend.  Now it's like, all right, we have 10 minutes on the Love Network.  The Love Network.  And they're like, oh, we're into minute six.  I'm exhausted.  The Love Network consists of three channels now, one of them being Telemundo.  And they had some big gets this year.  Maybe instant feedback can help us or pal talk.  We saw a clip where they said, thank you, Joanne Worley. 
[00:11:00]  Joanne Worley, thank you for showing Joanne Worley.  She was one of the regulars on Ronan Martin's Laughin' in 1968.  Why are you thanking Joanne Worley?  She had nothing better to do.  Oh, Joanne Worley.  Thank you, Joanne Worley.  And thank you, Rich Voss, for sending that audition tape.  We didn't have room for you this year. 
[00:11:30]  But maybe next year.  Maybe next year.  Rich Voss, it's Rich Voss.  They are just, it should be put to say, what actually should have happened?  Don't take this the wrong way.  Norm Crosby, they're coming in.  Thank you, Bill.  Norm Crosby was on.  Not that I have any ill feelings or ill will toward Jerry Lewis,  but the truth of the matter is the guy probably should have died already.  And they should have replaced him with some younger guy that could have hipped up the telethon.  Because they still have big bands. 
[00:12:00]  You don't wish Jerry Lewis actually would die.  You just wish he would die in the sense of maybe giving up the hosting duty.  No, I'm talking dying.  Dude, I'm not wishing death on him.  I'm saying at his age and one of the medical problems he's had,  he probably should have died a couple of years ago.  Yeah, he's had some close calls.  And then they would have put some new guy in there that doesn't have a big band intro every time.  It's like, it's like Benny Goodman is running this goddamn thing.  They got to hip it up a little if they want to get some younger viewers. 
[00:12:30]  Guaranteed, the only place this is on every year is in drooling old folks' homes and mental institutions.  Watch the telethon because no one's watching this.  I guess Bill Watts because you got the big gets.  The big celebrities this year were Joanne Worley.  Joanne Worley.  Norm Crosby who has the weirdest freaking comedy act ever.  Because he can't hear.  And then also, let's not forget, Tony Orlando without Dawn. 
[00:13:00]  Tony Orlando with no Dawn?  Without Dawn.  Aw, that's a shame.  Jerry Lewis telethon, co-host and guest, MDA national chairman and telethon star Jerry Lewis.  Joined by anchor Ed McMahon and co-host Jan Carl.  Who?  Tom Bergeron.  Allison Sweeney.  Honk your horn when you know any of these people.  Honk your horn.  I'm serious.  Who the hell are these people?  Tony Orlando, we should get a few honks there. 
[00:13:30]  Billy Gilman.  He's hard to get.  Isn't he that kid with the angelic voice that was like 12?  He's probably like 30 now.  Isn't that who that is?  Who's Billy Gilman?  I think Billy Gilman was that little, that little ephor that had the voice of an angel.  Yeah.  No?  Maybe?  I have no idea.  Norm Crosby was a big get.  Bob Zaney and the Muppets.  All right.  There he is.  Billy Gilman.  This kid was like a little fella. 
[00:14:00]  Just a little thing.  Now he's a man.  All right.  Honk your horn if you know any of these people.  This year's on-air talent includes Celine Dion.  Well, of course we know Celine Dion.  Montgomery Gentry.  That's a bit of a drop-off.  Christopher Milani.  He's an actor.  Shut up.  Mariska.  No, no.  Him and Mariska.  You know that?  Mariska Argette.  Argette.  Are both actors.  What show are they on?  They were on the show.  Richard Belzer.  Oh, wow.  A long order.  Okay.  Hey, Tony Danza was there. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  Thanks for writing my bit, Jimmy.  I want to, you know, give a couple of bucks to old turner plagues if I could, Jerry.  All right.  Thanks for writing the bit, but do you know?  Well, people out there know who they are.  All right.  But, all right.  Tony Danza, we know.  Ivanka Trump, we know.  John Madden.  Vanessa Williams.  Michael Urie.  Son of Mr. and Mrs. Urie.  They left the N out.  Ace Young.  Bear in the Big Blue House.  The Commodores. 
[00:15:00]  Ah, the Commodores.  I want to see how many original members of the Commodores.  George Wallace, John Tesh.  John Tesh.  Lance Burton, Louie Anderson.  Ah, Louie Anderson.  Oh, good.  These kids in the chair are better off than my childhood.  I'd rather have MDA than an abusive alcoholic father and an enabling mother to turn me into  this fat mess.  That wheelchair looks handy.  My legs are tired with every stamp. 
[00:15:30]  His whining act.  Did he sop up the sweat and throw it at the cripples?  Maureen McGovern?  What did she sing?  Did she sing, There's Got to Be a Morning After?  Is that what?  For the original Poseidon Adventure?  All right.  Wow.  Okay.  It could be.  How about Ron Lucas, R-O-N-N Lucas?  Yeah, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Lucas, as Jimmy brought up earlier.  And then, of course, the casts of Grease and Legally Blonde and Much, Much More. 
[00:16:00]  Ah, I like the Much, Much More part.  A little too early for the Much, Much More.  You should have gave us one get there.  There you go.  Damn.  And then Jerry Lewis, of course, a lot of controversy today because he used the old F-word for gay folk.  The old F-word for gay folk.  This is a little bit of old school Jerry chiming in.  And this is some of Jerry's, like, oh, when him and Dino and old Frank used to hang out,  they'd throw around those words that we can only use letters for now, just hanging out at the bar, backstage. 
[00:16:30]  You know, they're just slamming back martinis, slapping their dames and making fun of the gays.  Oh, calling Sammy a one-eyed N.  Hey, you N, don't be an F.  Bring me a C.  Oh, of course.  You know, and God bless America, man.  The guy raised another $63 million. 
[00:17:00]  We're not going to be talking about that today.  This clip is making its rounds.  It's making the rounds on YouTube.  Maybe you should let the guy slide.  He just freaking raised $63 million more.  But this is what we're talking about today.  We're into hour 18.  Look how good he moves that camera over here.  Son of a gun.  Wherever I go, he goes, let's see what you do with this over here.  Oh, your family has come to see you. 
[00:17:30]  You remember Bart, your older son?  Jesse, the illiterate faggot?  No.  No, no.  And then he looked so confused, like, what did I do?  Like an old man that crapped himself.  That's what he looked like.  He was like, oh no, oh no.  Jerry Lewis, he made another joke and he got nothing.  And he actually looked at the crowd in shock.  And he said something like nothing on that.  And he was so pissed off. 
[00:18:00]  Nothing.  But he was slurring his words.  Like, he was slurring through that.  He's bad.  I hear he's miserable.  Miserable.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've heard that he's just a miserable guy.  Yeah.  Well, I think he's stuck.  I think he felt like, well, this will be something I'll do maybe for 10, 15 years.  He'll cure it.  I'll be a hero.  And then I'll move back.  Move on to my movie career.  I'll move back into movies or something else.  But now, because it's the same thing with him.  He's stuck.  He can't, like, oh, I'm stepping down.  But Jerry, you're the face of MDA. 
[00:18:30]  You can't step.  Oh, my God.  I can't even talk.  I'm dying.  I'm dying.  I'm dying over here.  I'm dying.  He's been doing it for, it's got to be 30 years minimum.  Minimum.  Someone get the total.  Stance is 34, right?  34.  I think 40.  Oh, 40.  40 years this son of a bitch has been doing this.  That poor guy.  40 years.  40 years and no cure.  Selene.  Think of everything they've cured in 40 years or at least gotten some type of treatment that works. 
[00:19:00]  When a kid has muscular dystrophy, hit the chair.  It's the same thing back in the 40s.  Here's today's bit for the people that like, you know, surfing and helping out the show.  So, first of all, when did the telethon start?  What's the year?  We need the year.  And then we've got to figure out all the stuff we have cured and figured out in that time period.  Haven't we gone to the moon?  Oh, yes, yes.  Since then?  Yeah, yeah.  Probably. 
[00:19:30]  If it's 40 years.  1966, everybody.  Oh, yeah.  Hell, yeah.  Is there any way to find out what we have cured since 1966?  66.  66.  Everything but muscular dystrophy.  Dude, even the AIDS thing, they figured out some things.  Cancer.  Just slow that crap down.  A lot of strides made in cancer.  Just amazing.  But muscular dystrophy is like, you got it? 
[00:20:00]  Ah, here, the kid's in the chair.  Put him in a chair with wheels on it.  Yeah.  What did we do 40 years ago?  Put him in a chair with wheels on it.  Bill from Waterford, I guess he was all over the marathon over the weekend.  He said that this is the 42nd telethon, and they've raised over two...  The big V?  Two billion dollars.  Two billion dollars for naught.  We got to start asking questions. 
[00:20:30]  We got to start asking some serious questions.  Tuberculosis cured in 1971.  All right.  I don't know.  They found a cure.  Oh, man.  No more polio, but polio was before 66, no?  We're right around there.  I had the last year of polio vaccines in 68, I think.  Those are the ones you got in your arm?  Yeah.  68 was last year.  That's how you can tell how old someone is.  If they make that little mark.  If you don't have that polio mark, you're...  A little mark.  Stupid medicine. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Did they give that to you?  What do I got?  I got one.  We all got one.  I mean, two out of three of us.  Mine's very light.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  We're just getting started here.  We're back from vacation.  It's September 4th, 2007.  Me and Jimmy are touching feet.  Oh, God.  Me and Jimmy's feet are touching.  Dude, I was openly laughing about that senator crap.  What's his name?  Larry Craig?  Larry Craig.  Larry Craig.  The dirty boy.  Naughty boy?  Oh, and a naughty, naughty boy. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  You see that cop in the sting operation?  You look like Eminem.  How would Larry resist?  That kid was good looking.  I feel bad for the cop.  What?  Did he pull that duty?  Duty?  You know, one of the cops that helps us out from time to time, his whole gig when he's  not here is hanging out in a Port Authority bathroom catching pervs.  Off the job, you mean?  Huh?  That's his gig.  He has to hang out in the bathrooms at the Port Authority.  He was telling me all about it one day as we were doing the walkover. 
[00:22:00]  Really?  I swear to God.  I'm like, just who gives a crap?  These poor cops have to sit on the stall all afternoon and all night waiting for a creep.  All right, we'll get into it next.  We've got lots to do, so.  And also, does someone around here have some exciting news?  Yeah?  Ah.  Somebody here has exciting news for the Opie and Anthony show?  Someone in this very room has an exciting announcement. 
[00:22:30]  That's a nice tease.  Something that might have happened to them during vacation?  Yes.  Yes.  Are we getting a nod?  We're getting a nod.  And also, Sam and E-Rock went to SummerSlam together, and I heard it was just a hoot.  I heard one story that just had me roaring in the office.  All right, we'll take a quick break.  I didn't even put it on the list, but I've been banned.  My book has been banned from a library.  What library?  Congratulations.  That's what you want, Jimmy.  In Mississippi.  By the way, man. 
[00:23:00]  Mississippi Library?  Well, go figure that one out.  By the way, I was driving home from the Outer Banks on, what day was it?  God, I lost track of days.  I guess Sunday.  And I saw your billboard.  I laughed my ass off, man.  Isn't that great?  Jimmy's naked body with just a little towel on it is on a huge billboard.  A little moist towelette.  On the New Jersey Turnpike, man.  I was laughing my ass off.  It is really funny.  I think we got a picture of that on the website.  Yeah, it's despicable.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:23:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  How's everybody?  You all right?  What's up, bitches?  Our phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Good morning, Philly.  Trying to get me a little homesick for a vacation playing this kind of music.  Got a little reggae to it. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Down in the Caribbean.  I was in the Bahamas.  Drinking coconut drinks and dirty bananas.  Just like Senator Craig.  Well, I found the wide stance thing, man.  Oh, God.  The wide stance.  Well, Larry Craig, he's a senator where?  Out of Idaho?  Right?  Yeah, right.  Republican senator out of Idaho.  Is it Iowa or Iowa?  Idaho.  Idaho.  Idaho.  Idaho, Udaho. 
[00:24:30]  Senator Craig resigns over sex scandal, apologizes for distraction.  He calls it a distraction.  That's a little distraction.  Disgraced Senator Larry Craig resigned yesterday, apologizing for the unwanted distraction caused  by his arrest on charges of trolling for sex in an airport men's bathroom.  That's a crime trolling for sex in an airport bathroom.  Like, if two guys were outside, you know, and they're so inclined to be gay, wouldn't 
[00:25:00]  you be able to just go up to them and go, hey, what are you doing?  Want to go out?  You want to have sex?  Whatever.  Like, why is it in an airport bathroom there's a problem?  Just because you're late for a flight or you're delayed and you're in a rush, you don't want  to have to fend someone off.  Like, yeah, what time am I boarding?  What?  It's the last thing you need. 
[00:25:30]  Is that what it is?  The last thing you need, you're trying to, you know, rid yourself of those hot wings from  the night before.  You're just miserable.  That makes sense, then, because it's a person who is not, doesn't want the advance.  Yeah, but if it's two guys, like, kind of signaling, because I hear this whole thing  is a big signal thing.  There's hand signals going off like a third base coach, but I don't know if it's that  you're not into it or it's two gay guys, but I could see if you're just trying to catch  a flight and some guy's, like, got his foot under there, tapping you, hey, buddy. 
[00:26:00]  What?  No.  Thank you, but no.  Could you hand over some toilet paper and you put your hand under there with some toilet  paper and blam, there it goes.  Now you take the toilet paper back with you.  What I found funny about the story is that there's an actual cop and this is his whole  gig.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking, what the hell did the cop do wrong that he has this patrol?  Yeah, they probably laugh at that one.  Oh.  Especially when you get, like, a Larry Craig.  Yeah.  Well, I apologize for what I have caused. 
[00:26:30]  I'm deeply sorry, said Craig, who did not repeat his angry assertion from last week that  I am not gay.  I've never been gay.  Not gay.  Don't call me gay.  Never been gay.  Gay.  Not gay.  Gay.  I just like the taste.  He couldn't say he wasn't gay more.  In shirt sleeves and holding hands with his wife, Suzanne.  Of course.  Craig said he wanted to pursue my legal options in attempting to withdraw his guilty plea in  the airport incident last June. 
[00:27:00]  But his court case would be an unfair and unwanted distraction to Idahoans expecting a full-time  senator.  How is it a legal quandary when someone arrests you and says, hey, were you in the bathroom?  And you go, no, I wasn't guilty.  I'll plead guilty.  I'll plead guilty.  How does that happen?  Why would you?  You wouldn't.  That's just it.  You would fight this.  This isn't some guy who's been on trial and appeals for 10 years going, all right, I'll  cop a plea.  Right, right.  Can we just get done with this?  The guy was in the station for, what, two minutes? 
[00:27:30]  All right, you got me.  No, it wasn't even that.  When they probably broke out the old videotape and said, look, dude, we can do it your way  or we can do it our way.  Look what we got.  We can make this easy for you, buddy.  Yeah, you'd fight it.  You would definitely fight this.  Are you thinking there's more evidence that could come out?  Obviously.  Obviously.  Why else would you go, all right, all right, let's just get this over with.  Yeah.  I don't want to drag this one on for too long.  You don't want your family to see this, do you? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, God.  There were pictures.  Despite Craig's bitterness, he has no one to blame but himself, said Patrick Salmon, president  of Log Cabin Republicans, a group that advocates for gay and lesbian equal rights.  His explanations were incredible, said Salmon, referring to Craig's contention that he bumped  the foot of an undercover cop in the next men's room stall because he had a wide stance in  using the bathroom.  That's his excuse. 
[00:28:30]  I would have believed it more if he said, in college, I was a center on the high school  football team and I was having a flashback.  Right.  A wide stance.  How wide of a stance do you need to touch another man's foot underneath the stall partition?  That is a great, great excuse right there.  Here's what they supposedly do.  One guy, the guy that wants to initiate the action, this would be Larry Craig, would do 
[00:29:00]  this.  He sits down and taps his foot a couple of times.  Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  Then the cop knows this is a signal.  He's a cop.  He's briefed on this.  He's told before he goes in, he goes, what'll happen is, the signal is, someone's going to  tap their foot.  That starts the whole thing.  So he's tapping.  Can we slow this whole thing down a little bit?  Yeah.  Yeah, because let's get, the police dude is in the stall waiting.  Just waiting.  For an hour, two hours.  And you know the horrific things he's got to like hear and smell as he's hoping to catch 
[00:29:30]  a creep?  Oh, it's got to be horrid.  It could be the worst job in America.  Although you don't have to excuse yourself to go to the bathroom at any time.  You can just, you're just sitting there and you're like, oh God, just a businessman from,  you know, Pittsburgh in the next stall.  Oh God.  Tuscaloosa.  Right.  Yeah, puts his briefcase down, been on a plane just eating horribly all week.  Oh God, here's some dude from Philly that had a Philly cheesesteak.  Oh yeah, the meal on the plane. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, this guy had big scrawled.  Here comes a chili dog.  Right.  You just got to sit there and hear and smell this crap all day.  Deal with that one.  But anyway, go ahead.  So the cops are told, you know, the tapping foot is what initiates it.  So when the foot taps, and that's what Larry Craig did, tapping his foot, the cop then slides  his foot over.  So it's not even that Larry Craig had a wide stance.  The cop then sees the tapping and slides his foot over close to the other guy's foot, but 
[00:30:30]  doesn't touch it.  Now the other guy that was tapping the foot, now he moves his foot over and touches the  other guy's foot.  When this touch is made and then no one moves away, because if you're just some regular guy  and some other guy touches your foot under the stall somehow, you're not going to just leave  your foot there.  So now the big deal maker is where Larry Craig then takes his hand and kind of wraps it around 
[00:31:00]  the bottom edge of the partition and moves it back and forth, back and forth, kind of  rubbing the bottom of the partition.  And then that's supposed to be a deal maker.  There's your deal maker.  And that means I would like some gay bathroom sex.  You can isolate that if you want.  I smell promo!  Could this be Tim's first promo since back from vacation? 
[00:31:30]  Can I ask how everybody knows this?  I don't know.  It's amazing.  It's like some kind of code, like they're breaking the Navajo code we used in World War  II.  But how do two gay guys, one's a senator from Idaho in Minneapolis, and one's a guy, say,  from Florida, how do they know that three caps equals the hand under the...  Right.  Yeah.  How the hell do you know?  God.  Oh, from cruising websites.  Squirt.org.  Squirt.org.  It's an organization?  I don't know.  Cruisy Restrooms? 
[00:32:00]  Cruisy Restrooms, also known as cottaging in the UK.  We'll be cottaging this evening, yes.  Cottaging.  Are you cottaging?  Yes, I would like to cottage with you.  How do you...  A good way to find out whether a restroom is cruisy...  I guess that's a restroom that you could do this kind of thing.  Look for graffiti on the stall walls if it's cruisy.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You might not want to go to squirt.org.  Uh-oh.  Oof, Jesus.  All right. 
[00:32:30]  Then again, maybe you will.  Wow, that's got to hurt.  The one time we actually want a Foundry logo.  Oh, my God.  I'll put a watermark on everything.  And maybe more.  It won't just be water, my friend.  All right, anyway.  Yeah, to find out if it's cruisy, look for graffiti.  If it's a cruisy, you should be able to see all types of writing and drawing suggesting that there's action there.  Generally speaking, washrooms with two sets of doors are always the best. 
[00:33:00]  You can usually hear the first door giving you time to cover up before someone comes through the second door.  There you go, like an airlock.  Well, what if the cop is already in there?  Exactly.  The urinals.  If you're cruising the urinals and there's someone beside you that you think is hot,  you might just give him a glance and see if he can strike eye contact.  Most straight guys will never look at you while you are doing that and using the urinal.  If you can get some eye contact, this might be a good time to start playing with certain things a bit. 
[00:33:30]  If he starts doing the same, you have a live one.  It's like fishing.  It's like noodling.  It's like fishing.  Well, what bait am I going to use today?  You got to jiggle the bait around or else the fish ain't going to bite.  Do you need advice on a website for this?  One is look at the graffiti and see what it says.  And one is if a guy looks at you while you use it.  Who doesn't know that?  This is pretty obvious.  Who wouldn't know that that's a signal? 
[00:34:00]  Well, now we go to the stalls though.  Oh, yeah, this is where the action happens.  Many cruisers go for the handicapped stall if there is one because it offers the most room  and often the furthest one down at the end of the washroom.  Once you can pull your pants down, this is a good sign that you're open for business.  Once you pull your pants, oh, so that people can see it from underneath.  Couldn't that also mean that you're just using the bathroom properly?  Could be, but here it is. 
[00:34:30]  Here it is.  And this is from Squared.org.  If there's someone beside you...  All right, hold on, hold on.  Yes.  The one above.  Yeah, the one above that they didn't highlight is hilarious.  Who knew this was going on?  Ah, more and more public restrooms have automatic toilet flushing devices.  Take a couple of sheets of toilet paper folded, spit on the edge, and cover the electronic sensor.  That way you can lean forward to check out other people that are trying to get the same type of satisfaction. 
[00:35:00]  That's kind of weird.  They did it in two words.  You did it in a sentence.  Yeah.  Another like-minded gentleman.  Without the toilet automatically flushing.  Wow, that's handy.  What a buzzkill.  Oh, my...  Damn.  God, that looks really...  You just want to take a little peek-a-roo.  Just a little peek.  You want to lean down and peek. 
[00:35:30]  But you know there's people on the other side of the bathroom.  I've got to be really quiet.  I've got to be really quiet.  Oh, God.  Wait, it looks like there's one under here.  Oh, my God.  Let me bend over.  Damn.  It looks out your kidney.  Just the telltale noise that you're behaving weirdly.  Right.  You're drawing...  The one time you have to be quiet and discreet, you're just drawing attention.  What's that man doing in there?  Nothing.  You've got a thunderstorm in there.  Son, just leave, son. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  Now I'll move on to the good highlight.  Now, here it is.  If there's someone beside you, try tapping your foot once and see if he taps back.  What if you just have a song in your head?  Oh, God.  You know?  You just tap...  You got your iPod on.  You're just tapping your foot.  You're just tapping along and all of a sudden, like, why is this guy handing me over a trombone?  If you're tapping into this, though, on your iPod, that's a different story.  Good point, sir. 
[00:36:30]  Good point.  Yeah, you're just tapping your foot.  You're just trying to enjoy some music.  In your mind, you hear, umbrella, Ella, Ella.  And the next thing, you see a fleshy Senator Manhand waving at you.  You're beautiful.  You're beautiful.  You got me suicidal.  Let me just tap my foot.  Yeah.  Try tapping your foot.  See if he taps back.  If he does, move your foot closer and do it again.  After a couple of taps back and forth, you're usually in luck.  Clearing your throat can also be a good way of letting others know. 
[00:37:00]  Clearing your throat of what?  Of letting other guys in the restroom know you're there.  I can just see the fun that's going to happen in the bathrooms here today.  Why don't you just make a neon sign?  Tap, tap, tap.  It's just like a tuberculosis ward.  And then, oh, they have pictures of the stalls.  Those are your basic stalls.  If there are no glory holes. 
[00:37:30]  Wow.  Never seen one without one.  What places am I going?  I'm not teasing.  Of course.  Go for the under the stall action.  Make sure that if you are.  Wow.  All right, let me just see.  Underneath the stall that you are flexible enough to quickly get up and recover.  All right.  If you're using just the space between the floor and petition, and there's two guys doing certain things. 
[00:38:00]  You better be in a yoga class during the week.  You know what you got to do?  You got to look like you're trying to limbo underneath the stall.  That's pretty much your job, is to look like you're limboing under the stall.  And the other guy has to look like he's trying to start a fire from embers.  That's pretty much the look we're getting from two stalls.  Yeah, limbo, limbo.  Tap, tap, tap, tap.  If there are holes, glory holes, you pretty much don't need any info for that. 
[00:38:30]  Many guys just share the same stall.  That's got to be risky.  You may need to get creative to find ways to conceal the fact there are two guys in the stall in case an uninvited guest appears on the scene.  That means cop.  I've heard of one guy standing in an empty shopping bag.  How well another guy takes care of him.  That was the old crinkle crinkle.  That was the old lad bag.  The lad bag. 
[00:39:00]  Where there's somebody who's confused and frightened in the bag.  Right.  Just spinning around.  And stomping around.  You don't want to stomp your little feet in the bag because that makes a crinkle crinkle sound.  What's happening to me?  Crinkle crinkle crinkle crinkle little bit.  That one is good if you're shopping in a mall or something.  It just looks like you're going to the bathroom and there's a shopping bag in front of you, yet a gentleman is standing in the bag.  That's right.  It's genius.  You've bought yourself some public embarrassment, a drug cocktail 25 years down the road. 
[00:39:30]  But by the way, don't be a silly goose and get the clear bag.  That's a genuine mistake that people make because they get the clear plastic.  Older washrooms might have a toilet tank where you can sit down while another guy does something.  So, you know, you would be sitting on the tank.  Well, they used the word chowing.  Yeah.  Let's just use your imagination.  And someone else, though, that might look suspicious because your feet would be pointing the wrong way as you're sitting on the toilet. 
[00:40:00]  No, no, no.  If you're sitting on the tank.  You're sitting on the toilet tank where you can sit while another guy.  He's standing in front of the toilet.  So it looks like the guy is actually, if you looked under you, you would just see a guy at the bottom of his feet facing the toilet.  Oh, my God.  This could be proper, too.  And then it said, I'm sure you have some ideas of your own.  Perhaps.  Like maybe you wink at each other and then you go to a motel.  Find a room.  And save yourself the embarrassment of being arrested for having sex in a toilet where people are going to the bathroom. 
[00:40:30]  And trying to catch adjoining flights.  And look, I'm not going to say I've not been a filthy person.  How, with the odors in those rooms and the sounds, how do you enjoy yourself?  Think of the odors and think of who's.  You really must have the urge.  Because, yeah, I'm with you, Jimmy.  That's like a fine rose.  And it's like bouquet.  That is true.  It's like somebody spraying cologne onto the straw. 
[00:41:00]  Well, here's CNN reporting on cruising.  All right.  Welcome back, everybody.  Welcome back from vacation.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Welcome.  Uh-huh.  Well, there you go.  Our first F up.  That didn't take long.  Let me try this.  Less than an hour.  Let me try this again here.  All right.  A lot of people suggesting that Mike Rowe should do a dirty job on this. 
[00:41:30]  He's running out of dirty jobs.  I took a pee class night.  I did, too, yeah.  And you saw him making caramel popcorn or whatever, caramel corn.  Yeah.  He's got people.  Like, what's dirty about that?  He's soliciting at the end of the show is to have people call in and give him dirty jobs.  He goes, because, you know, we've kind of run out.  He's being pretty blunt about it.  He goes, look, we ran out.  He was making caramel corn in Philly somewhere.  That's not dirty.  That's tasty.  How about the guy that swabs out the glory holes with alcohol at the end of the week in  the bathrooms? 
[00:42:00]  Are they that nice and clean?  Well, I mean, there's got to be someone that cleans the bathroom.  I think the police officer was taken out in the airport bathroom because for years.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  That doesn't sound too good.  All right.  Well.  That sounds low.  Yeah.  All right.  Get that one back.  Maybe we'll use it later.  There you go.  Larry Craig, though, his excuse, he uses a wide stance in the bathroom.  But it doesn't explain the tapping.  He did that exact tapping routine.  Tap, tap, tap.  He's into it.  You know what I love about this whole story is the fact that the whole story is hot. 
[00:42:30]  is the fact that he's one of these Republican, just like hard, religious, against gay marriage.  Now, I don't care which way you lean on that one.  It doesn't matter to me.  And I don't even care if the guy wants to be a Republican or not.  It's these holier-than-thou people that get caught.  And you care about the hypocrisy of the whole thing.  It's the hypocrisy, and I love when people trip over their own unit because it happens  so often with these people.  Oh, I was on my way to a great political career when, whoops, I tripped over something. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, jeez.  And I tripped while I was yawning, and guess what wound up in my mouth?  Good for him and Mark Foley, who's another one, that Republican senator, and who was against  a online porn.  Yeah, they're all against all these things that people can control, and 99% of the people  can just look at and enjoy and whatever, whatever you're supposed to do with it, you know, grab  a hole and take care of business while you're looking at the internet, whatever.  It doesn't mean you're out in bathrooms doing the old tap dance, doing an old soft shoe 
[00:43:30]  so you can get a little in between flights.  Come on.  Can you imagine working like you're in the middle stall, there's one on the left?  You're like Cab Calloway doing Minnie the Moocher.  You're scatting under this door.  Gregory Hines was arrested today in a mix-up.  He was hoofing.  What do you guys think?  Should we send E-Rock to a...  Oh, God, if he got arrested.  We should send him and see if it works. 
[00:44:00]  You know how funny that would be?  That would be really funny.  All right, we got to take a break.  Tap, tap, tap.  Can you tap, tap your foot, E-Rock?  Especially if, like, Eric walked out of the stall and they saw him and they went, forget it.  Yeah, forget it.  I'm not interested.  Sam, we should send.  My type.  Because that kid would be, believe me, he'd be J-Lo in one of those places.  J-Lo.  Sam walked in, music would actually play over the loudspeaker.  He could tap and flick a quarter with his ankle at the gay guy next to him.  A kid from Nickelodeon. 
[00:44:30]  I love that episode.  All right, quick break here.  It's Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  It's also Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday or Wake Up Your Spouse Tuesday.  Well, Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  And, of course, the big get today is the Rock Scream Tuesday thing.  But Make Up Stuff Tuesday, we got to do early.  Well.  Right?  Well, this is the last time we mentioned that.  Yeah.  Make Up Stuff Tuesday.  How's that?  So you make something up.  Don't make it ridiculous.  Right.  But, you know, make it good.  So people that tune in later on and don't know it's Make Up Stuff Tuesday really think it's real. 
[00:45:00]  And someone on the staff, the O'Brien Anthony staff, has a huge announcement.  Yep.  Whoa.  Should we do the huge announcement next?  Hello?  Should we do the huge announcement next?  Yes.  I'm just trying to look over and see where the huge announcement comes from.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  You know what?  I almost cursed.  We missed the angle here.  Dave in Alberta.  Go ahead, Dave.  Dave.  Yeah, I saw that one.  He was doing a Larry King. 
[00:45:30]  So how important is the foot tap?  So you're tapping your foot.  And then what do I do?  I reach under and rub the partition.  Is this enjoyable to you gay people?  Stupid Larry King.  How enjoyable is it to have a mouth on ****?  Is it good?  All right.  It's funny when you say this. 
[00:46:00]  Someone has a big announcement.  All of a sudden, Steve's going to run in.  Okay, okay.  All right.  It's not so big.  Everyone knew.  What?  Oh.  I've spit on many tissues and put them over many sensors.  All of a sudden, you see like a hand with big fat Lebanese fingers and a bunch of silver  rings chinkaling-a-linging at you under the bathroom stall.  So his fingers are all callous from rubbing the bottom of partitions.  Yes.  Perfectly.  Perfect dexterity on those fingers. 
[00:46:30]  Yes.  During like website stuff.  I type out Morse code.  All right.  I'm that good.  We got a break.  Our phone number, 877-212.  Big announcement.  Next.  On the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.N.A.  Now I messed up the phone number because you went like that there.  So let me do this.  877-212-O-N-A.  Now you in.  Big announcement.  Coming up after this.  And unfortunately, the big announcement is going to be during the segment that is Makeup  Stuff Tuesday, and no one's going to believe anything. 
[00:47:00]  Let them try to figure it out.  Figure it out yourself.  It's going to get very interesting today.  I guarantee that.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  It's O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:47:30]  It's O.P. and Anthony.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Our phone number, 877-212-O-N-A.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  You can get the instant feedback link off our website. 
[00:48:00]  But Sonny Farrelly brings up a very good point that made me really laugh hard.  We were talking about the foot tapping and the cruising in the men's rooms and stuff.  And Sonny goes, how do you get that done in New Jersey?  Because all the stalls are bricked from floor to ceiling.  Yeah, they're starting to just brick them off.  That's how bad they want to keep the gay out.  That now they're using cinder blocks.  And blocking you off from other men.  Now they're tunneling through.  They're tunneling under like the great escape. 
[00:48:30]  Like in Gaza, like in Israel.  Yeah, they get through.  He's tunneling under.  There was a day it was just like there was no boundaries or borders, you know.  And slowly but surely, a few years have passed.  And now it's brick walls in between the stalls.  I dig.  I dig so I can get homosexual sex.  I dig.  Uh, this just in. 
[00:49:00]  This just in.  Yes.  Led Zeppelin getting back together.  Ugh.  Weren't we recently talking about this?  And I believe it was you, Opie, that said, uh, thank God Led Zeppelin's like one band that  decided they weren't going to try to put themselves back together under Led Zeppelin and tour.  Right.  And now they did it.  Yeah.  Supposedly they're, uh, going to be making an announcement that any, any day now, any hour, 
[00:49:30]  the rumor is swirling.  Yeah.  They, they just, I guess they see all these bands doing this and making boatloads of cash.  And they figure, eh, why not?  I'll tell you why not.  Because you're not Led Zeppelin anymore.  Uh, and, and you certainly wouldn't sound like Led Zeppelin.  As long as the singer is okay, uh, and the guitar player, I guess, um, eh, you're all right.  It'd probably be all right.  It's weird.  Cause I was talking about, um, Jimmy Page on the way home from, uh, North Carolina. 
[00:50:00]  That was a long drive, man.  Ran out of things to talk about.  All of a sudden I'm talking about Jimmy Page when I saw him back in 19, uh, 19 aught, what?  And probably around 88, 89, he was doing some kind of solo thing.  Yeah.  And he had a lead singer that kind of sounded like Robert Plant.  And, uh, the rumor back then was that Jimmy Page couldn't play anymore.  Really?  Cause he was so like, uh, either effed up or his ears were shot that they actually had  a guy, this is now a rumor, but it was a pretty strong rumor that he had a guy off to the  side playing the leads. 
[00:50:30]  And that Page was...  He's got cancer.  Right.  And that Page was really pretty much just playing more like a rhythm guitar on stage.  And, and the real, uh, the real playing was, uh, being done on, on, on the side there of  the stage by some young, young gunslinger.  Some young buck.  So now this news comes out that Zeppelin's getting back together.  And the first thought was, can Jimmy, you know, Page even play anymore?  Can he play?  Um, I, I think so.  But, uh, it's, Robert Plant's the problem. 
[00:51:00]  Robert Plant's the problem here.  We've heard he can't, he can't do it anymore.  He really wasn't able to do it back in the heyday.  Not live.  In a studio, he could record those albums.  It was great.  But live, it was never as good.  And now, forget about it.  Uh-huh.  Been a long time since I rock and roll.  Been a long time since I rock.  And give it to the crowd.  Yeah.  Oh, don't toss it to the crowd.  Stop it.  Oh, Coverdell and Page.  No, this was something else that Page did. 
[00:51:30]  Help me out.  I know there was a Coverdell Page thing, but there was also Page on his own doing something.  Look it up.  Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely.  No, I.  A whole lot of love.  I want a whole lot of love.  I want a whole lot of love.  I want a whole lot of love.  Way down, it's...  Woman.  You need... 
[00:52:00]  Uh, Led Zeppelin promoter warns fans against touts.  Touts?  What's touts?  I don't know, but I think you get that from touching the bottom of the petition.  I got the touts.  I don't know what that is.  Led Zeppelin promoter Harvey Goldsmith has warned fans to watch out for touts trying to rip them off,  but has not denied the British rock band will be reforming.  I bet some people are printing tickets as we speak.  Just print them out and start selling them.  Dude, Zeppelin!  Right.  Dude!  Make a fortune.  And then you get there and go, my ticket's not good. 
[00:52:30]  There's no Zeppelin without John Bonham.  Come on.  Who?  At this point, who?  Come on.  Who are any of these guys?  He was 32 when he died?  Yeah.  He looked like he was in his mid-40s.  He had a hell of a 32 years.  Man.  You know, who was able to go on?  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, true.  The who went on, and then, uh...  The police sound great.  They sound like they never took a break.  I don't know, man. 
[00:53:00]  And it's not like Bonham's out there doing something else where they could get him, like in stupid Van Halen.  Yeah.  He's just dead.  You can't...  You gotta...  If the guy's dead and his son's gonna do it...  You're kidding.  They're saying his son's gonna do it?  Jason, yeah.  Which makes, you know, if he's good, he's good.  Man, I met his son a few times.  What an ass.  Really?  What an a-hole.  All right, we get it.  Your father's John Bonham.  Why don't you do something for yourself?  Ooh.  He's...  Oh, God.  What an ass.  Why was he a jerk?  Just arrogant?  Oh, like you wouldn't believe.  Like he was rock royalty.  It's like, all right, relax, dude.  Well, the prince of rock royalty. 
[00:53:30]  Huh?  He's a prince of rock royalty.  Well, yeah, he thought he was rock royalty himself.  Well, we'll see how he sounds if they do get together.  He's a broken rubber of rock royalty.  So that's breaking today.  That's one of the big...  We might see Led Zeppelin on a stage again.  And I told Ann, I'm like, 20 years too late.  I'll even say 15 years too late.  Maybe early 90s, it still would have been something interesting.  But it's 2007.  I know. 
[00:54:00]  Enough already.  What are you doing?  Look at his giant head.  That's the loving shot.  I'm looking at a picture of Robert Plant.  Jimmy and I got pictures with Robert Plant, and his head is probably the biggest head you'll  ever see.  It's a giant head.  We look so gay together.  Like, my head is disgusting and fat in my neck.  And he's got like a half a cutie boy smile, but a lock of his hair is just like draped  across the face.  And you're snuggling, you're nuzzling his neck.  I am.  You should be arrested.  I mean, Robert Plant has those sleepy eyes. 
[00:54:30]  Yep.  He's got those bedroom eyes for Jimmy.  Look at that.  He really does.  Yeah.  He's wearing those tight Led Zeppelin slacks.  Of course he was.  And then you see my picture, and he's horrified because I grabbed him in the hall, and he's  like not happy to be taking a picture with me.  Look at that.  Look how big his head is.  It's giant.  My head is half the size of his.  You look like you're posing next to Mount Rushmore.  Nah, whatever.  It's pretty cool to have a picture with Robert Plant, though. 
[00:55:00]  Pretty cool.  Pretty cool.  Got him signed, too.  That's a biggie right there.  Master Poe.  Name a bigger rock star.  Paul McCartney, obviously, right?  McCartney's bigger, but that's about it, though.  That's about it.  You wouldn't even put Ringo big.  Nah.  Ringo's part of the Beatles, but...  No, Robert Plant.  Poor Ringo.  Robert Plant bigger than Ringo Starr.  But not as big as Paul McCartney.  Nah, I can't.  Mick Jagger.  Mick Jagger.  Yeah, there you go.  Mick Jagger's bigger.  Bono, bigger than Robert Plant.  No.  I think Bono is. 
[00:55:30]  No.  A whole different era.  And I love you, too.  And I prefer Plant.  So many bands were influenced by Zeppelin.  Not many bands being influenced by you, too.  No, you're right.  That's how I look at it.  Oh, we got...  With status as far as being a massive rock star in the world, I think that Bono is more  recognizable everywhere in the world than Robert Plant.  Yeah.  I would still...  He is big.  Chechnyan rebels like you, too.  But again, they might like Zeppelin, too.  He is big.  You want to hear a little?  Let's see if we got some Robert Plant.  This is live? 
[00:56:00]  Hold on, love.  We just thought before vacation, we failed miserably.  Is this going to be good?  All right, let's go.  Robert Plant, Whole Lotta Love.  That's...  That's...  Well, that's not the hard part.  I'd see that.  Wait, wait.  Come on.  It's easy to make fun, but I'd see that. 
[00:56:30]  When is this from?  73.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, that's affected right there.  Oh, this is 2005?  I'm not buying it. 
[00:57:00]  Sing it like the record, Robert.  I'm not buying it.  I paid my money.  Sing it like the record.  What are they making stew in the background?  It's bubbling.  Yeah, there's something on boil.  Yes.  I play the rolling boil.  That's the sound Larry Craig heard in the stall next to him.  Oh, see, listen to that.  Oh, boy.  It's not that bad. 
[00:57:30]  No, it's bad.  It's not that bad.  Dude, it ain't the goddamn song.  It's not that bad, though.  And it was love, love, love.  Love.  Where's the love?  Come on, go.  What's a big one?  Way down inside.  That's not bad.  That's not a singing thing.  That's a screaming thing.  I want to hear him sing the goddamn words up as high as he did. 
[00:58:00]  He will.  Screw him if you're charging $8 billion a ticket.  This is his solo man, too.  He's probably being experimental like this last time.  No, he's not.  He's being an asshole.  He'll get to that part when the chili's done.  Oh, my God.  This is over eight minutes long.  Yeah, the stew has to cook for a while in the background.  Football season right around the corner.  Got to get the chili done.  See, I couldn't sit through this crap.  I just want to hear the hooks of the hits, the way they sounded,  and leave this psychedelic bull crap to your basement. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, we're all doing crystal meth these days.  We don't need the psychedelic crap.  There's no LSD left.  Right.  I'm not going to sit there and listen to this  while I'm doing cocaine.  Now what?  No!  No!  No!  No!  Shut up!  He's dancing to sexy.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Does he break into it?  Here we go.  At some point?  How much time left?  Is there still a big guitar solo? 
[00:59:00]  There's still three and a half minutes.  Oh, my God.  He's got to go into it.  And he's going to go,  Oh, a lot of love.  Why are you allowing these studio musicians to have any more time than, like, 30 seconds?  He's got the microphone and chord held mock guitar style.  His head's back.  He's got the armadillo in his trousers kind of poking out.  And he's, like, doing that whole grooving thing.  I'm not paying for that.  And these are studio musicians just backing them up.  It was just Robert Plant. 
[00:59:30]  Here we go.  Here we go.  Where are we, India?  What's this?  This wasn't on the record.  Yeah, it sounds like Yoko Ono.  Anthony and I used to do a bit.  I love that old bit we did.  Agent Plants.  Oh, wait.  Oh, my God.  Wait, what happened?  How much time now?  Two and a half minutes.  What happened to Way Down Inside, Woman, You Need? 
[01:00:00]  See, you took such a long break.  He was able to get that first line out.  See?  I think it sounds good.  What?  No, listen.  What the hell is this?  I'd see this.  I'd see this.  No.  No.  Anybody can do this part. 
[01:00:30]  This is easy.  Does he do Way Down Inside?  We're never going to know.  I'm going to shut it off right now.  I'm going to shut it off.  I'm going to shut it off.  I'm going to shut it off.  I'm going to shut it off.  I'm going to watch what I do.  I'm going to hear it.  Don't.  What the?  Woman, you need jazz.  Need jazz?  Here it comes.  Rock Scream.  Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[01:01:00]  Rock Scream Tuesday.  That isn't the way it goes.  Rock Scream Tuesday.  It sucks.  I don't want to hear the reasons why or anything else, but that just stunk.  I think you got to give the guy a little break.  No, I'm not giving him anything.  He's an older gentleman.  I'm not giving him anything if he's charging $200 a ticket for the nosebleeds.  He's an older gentleman.  You don't want to see Muhammad Ali get in the ring.  Oh, yes, I do.  I bring up a good point.  More than I want to breathe.  I'm going to see that.  With a young dicey. 
[01:01:30]  Are we done?  What?  30 seconds.  30 seconds.  Come on.  See, it's all, everything's down.  This is with this band, though, where he did this weird experimental stuff.  Now, believe me, if he could sing like he did, he would have.  He can't.  He hasn't been able to in years.  It's not good. 
[01:02:00]  I want to be with you on that one, Ant, but it's not that bad.  Dude, it's horrid.  It's not that bad.  I'd see it.  Horrid.  Look.  Great.  I just saw Robert Plant.  Wow.  You used to be in front of an audience at Madison Square Garden.  Now it's in front of 30 people.  I'm in D.C. in front of the likes of Don Wicklund.  Stupid Don Wicklund.  Trying to tell everybody don't get a picture with him and don't have him sign anything.  Yeah, all right.  He's rock royalty. 
[01:02:30]  Did Wicklund say that?  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  I couldn't be bothered.  I love the rules they give you.  You work for the company that brings Robert Plant in and they're like, no pictures.  Yeah, okay.  I will get fired trying to get a picture with Robert Plant.  Oh, I know.  Somebody helped us so much that day.  Was it Jody?  I think somebody helped us tremendously.  I think it was her.  Well, it wasn't Don.  It wasn't like...  This just in.  Hey, hey!  You can't use that anymore!  What?  Hey!  How about that one? 
[01:03:00]  How about that one?  Give me a goddamn break.  Fox might be suing us because we used their stupid...  Fox is mad that we're using this.  This just in.  Fox is a tool.  Like, what?  We're having a little fun.  How come they can use your images with their job...  Exactly.  ...and they can't use their license with your job?  Exactly.  Let's take this all the way till not just they call up and say, could you not use that?  Let's see how far this goes. 
[01:03:30]  Donnie Wicklund, don't just pass on a message and say, oh, they got mad at this, that we're using it.  Let's see how far.  Here I go.  Special investigative report.  Let's see how far Fox goes in the sound clip standoff.  I think we mocked them so bad before break when we were doing that elevator bit.  Well, we just kept using it over and over and over again.  There was a, well, there were some legal documents that were sent our way. 
[01:04:00]  Were there documents or a phone call or something?  I want to know.  Before someone tells me I can't do something that I love doing and it's fantastic, that  sound is great.  Give me the goddamn reason.  Well, why don't we get Don Wicklund on the phone and find out.  Is that Don on the phone?  Get Don on the phone.  I want to know what happened because I was far, far away and I heard all sorts of rumblings  that Fox was really, really mad at us because we were using their stingers.  Using their stingers.  Yeah.  Stop.  Yeah.  Why?  Because we're using it for fun and not to panic at people every 10 seconds? 
[01:04:30]  Shark loose off Coney Island.  It was a minnow.  A guppy.  A guppy was in the water and you guys are like, oh my, get out of the water.  They're like Chief Brody shooting cyanide bullets into the water because they say a shark is  in there.  Some lifeguard picked it up by a gill and was like, oh, is this what you're talking about?  For the people that don't know here in the New York area, Rockaway Beach, I guess, you  know, a very popular spot. 
[01:05:00]  I saw the Sunday paper and they said they had some kind of, what was the headline?  Someone found the headline.  It said Jaws.  Jaws, of course.  And they showed the, they had a close-up of this shark that made it look like it was  like a, I don't know, an 18 foot great white.  Yeah.  It was taken with a macro focus.  And then you flip through the paper and then you get perspective on how big the shark was.  And it turns out the thing was maybe five feet and it was a thrasher shark, which won't  do much harm to you.  It might hit you and leave you a bruise with its tail.  Yes.  With its tail. 
[01:05:30]  It could leave a little scar on your arm.  The dumb daily news made it look like the, you know, we had a Jaws situation in Rockaway,  Rockaway Beach.  It wasn't?  Hey, you can't use that!  It's not.  They're going to get mad!  Good.  How many times have they pissed us off sitting here?  Yeah.  Give me a break.  Yeah.  Ah, hey!  My cantaloupe just arrived.  How many times did they sensationalize, you know, you and I on their stupid Fox News channel? 
[01:06:00]  How many times did you hear that stinger?  Coming up, don't be shot, shot, doctor, idiots again.  Right.  Oh, thanks.  They sensationalized us.  Why can't we sensationalize your stupid stinger and dumb stories?  How many times have they shown the picture of the radio in a car and played our voice?  Nya, nya, nya, nya.  Is that Don on the phone?  Get Don on the phone.  Yeah, so we had some kind of shark sighting.  Where's Wicklin?  Tell them if they find them around the grounds of the Washington complex to put the stick 
[01:06:30]  with this pointy thing on it and the bag down.  And the garbage can be picked up later.  Just put that stuff down and get to a phone.  We want to talk to you.  Yeah.  The toilets can be blocked up later.  Yeah.  Cinder blocks can be stacked.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So the shark thing was no big deal in Queens there, Rockaway Beach.  It was such a non-story.  Turns out I think the shark got hit by a motorboat.  See?  It was disoriented and it came into shore. 
[01:07:00]  Poor little guy.  And then they talked about how tough New Yorkers are because they just rolled the shark back  into the water.  Yeah.  Real tough.  Yeah.  Do that with a great white.  First of all, 90% of New Yorkers can't swim.  Right.  It's amazing to go to the city beaches and watch people drown.  Watch the lifeguards.  The hardest working lifeguards are on the beaches in New York City and the public pools.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  They sink like rocks.  Rockaway is just a bunch of 60-year-old people like up to their waist smoking. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  For a little exercise.  Hey, go back to that story, the shark story.  What's the headline though?  You got to find me the front page of the Daily News from Sunday because this just says shark  washes up at Rockaway Beach.  That's who gives a crap.  But the Jaws dropping drama.  I get it.  Began at 1056 when swimmers alert lifeguards that the creature was wiggling near the shore.  Wiggling.  Yeah.  If something's thrashing at the shore.  You know why it was wiggling?  At the shore.  It was trying to get some freaking, you know, get itself back in the water. 
[01:08:00]  I breathe this stuff.  Could you put me back in it?  Oh, here it is.  Here's the New York Post.  I didn't see the Post headline, but it's good.  Shark, Jaws terrifies Rockaways.  Look at the picture on the cover.  Get out of here.  No way they did this.  Jaws, Shark terrifies Rockaway.  It was a five foot thrasher that was injured that was kind of laying on its side.  Dude, here's the picture they got on the cover of the Post.  It goes from the absolute bottom of the newspaper and the fin goes up into the Britney Spears story. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  It wasn't big enough to fit on the paper.  Go Daily News, bro.  And his mouth is all because he's yawning, the shark.  He's just tired.  Yeah.  There was nothing menacing about this thing.  Nothing.  And it's even, you know how far you had to zoom in?  Oh, I know.  To get it to cover that much of the paper?  Oh.  No, that's the day after.  Bunch of phonies.  You can't even see teeth in his mouth.  No.  He has like old lady mouth.  He's like, eh, eh, eh, go to this one. 
[01:09:00]  He's telling someone it's chilly outside to wear a sweater.  It's chilly.  Let me tell you about my 10 billion grandchildren.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Jaws dropping drama.  Jaws dropping.  I saw the fin and I was like, oh my God.  That's a great quote there.  It's a good one.  Great quotes by people.  Eh, whatever.  I saw the fin.  I was like, oh my God.  Good one. 
[01:09:30]  Good one.  That's like the quote from the guy on the news this morning that there was an explosion.  An explosion.  They show a graphic, first of all.  And this is why I don't care about things like this.  They show a graphic of an explosion.  They say an explosion in New York City.  They showed the skyline of New York City and a huge explosion taking out half of Manhattan.  Yeah, it was a graphic.  With pieces flying all over.  Yeah.  Half of Manhattan was a thermal nuclear explosion.  That was the graphic.  And it turned out to be what?  A pipe bomb? 
[01:10:00]  It was pretty much an M-80.  At a dance studio?  It was nothing.  At some dance studio.  And this guy that they're interviewing goes, well, I heard a loud boom.  And it sounded like, I can't even describe it.  You just did.  You said you heard a loud boom.  And then he's sitting there going, how do I describe it?  And we're laughing at this idiot.  It's a thresher, not a thresher? 
[01:10:30]  All right.  Thresher shark.  Thresher shark.  Sorry about that.  So, all right, well.  Hope there's no teeth in its mouth.  Yeah, not a tooth in there.  It's not, it looks like a big fat nurse shark.  Yeah.  There you go.  Pansy shark.  What's sad is a lot of people out there depend on their local newspapers for real news.  And they get this crap.  They get this crap.  They're making it to a Jaws story.  It's a five-foot thresher that was injured because I think a jet ski hit him.  We tried to bite someone and they punched it and it slunk away, humiliated. 
[01:11:00]  All right, I apologize, I apologize.  I'm sorry.  Ow.  I need the headline from the Daily News.  Maybe we'll find it.  I don't know.  It's coming.  Two seconds.  Now, the Newsday called it a two-foot shark.  Two foot.  That's not even a shark.  A two-foot shark.  You're right.  It isn't a shark.  That's a shh.  Well, look at that.  The post made it look like Jaws, though, because they did the extreme close-up.  Is this the one?  They went big on that close-up, man.  Yeah.  Shark in Queens.  Ocean empties as shark swims up on beach. 
[01:11:30]  The ocean empties?  And New Yorkers put it back in water.  That's how you know it was like a little fruity shark when a bunch of just like lowly pedestrians  toss it back.  Yeah, just throw it back in.  I feel bad for the guy.  Beat it, stupid.  Back.  If it was a big shark, they'd be pounding it with rocks over the skull.  Wait, people couldn't like hoist an 18-foot great white back into the water.  No, you wouldn't touch it.  No, of course not.  Pictures with it.  All right.  Throw up gang signs in front of it.  Dude, these people were raping the shark, throwing it back in, pulling a train on it.  Tapping its fin. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Hey, we were supposed to do the big news thing this break.  Oh, God.  Someone on staff has a huge announcement.  Big announcement.  We'll do it after the break?  Yeah, let's do it after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I can never do one of these.  The first one was good.  Ready?  Bob Kelly.  That's all.  September 20th to the 23rd.  8 p.m. shows.  Improv.  East Bridge Street.  Pittsburgh, PA.  The Stacks at the waterfront. 
[01:12:30]  Ooh.  The Stacks.  You ever go to the Stacks?  It's under a bridge, and they put like a cheesecake factory and an improv, and all of a sudden  it's the hip place to go.  But anyways, I'm going to be there.  So come out, Pittsburgh.  I haven't been there in like four years.  Last time I was there, I got paid 800 bucks, and eight people showed up.  So you son of a bitches, come on out.  Improv.  No, what is it?  Improv Pittsburgh.  That's right.  Go to improv.com or call 412-462-4233. 
[01:13:00]  Biatch.  I'll go to my mind space.  Since you've been gone, I've been in a trance.  This heart needs a second chance.  Don't say it's over.  I just can't say goodbye.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rock and roll.  Good morning. 
[01:13:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  For everybody in Philly, keep listening to WYSP, please.  We're heading down to Philly for the last date on the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  It's the last one, huh?  Philly is the final stop, and I don't know if we're going to do it next year.  This could be your last chance to see this for a while.  It's a week from this Thursday and Friday.  Not this Thursday and Friday.  We're going to a week.  Listen to YSP because you've got many, many opportunities to kind of join us for the festivities.  They've got a full schedule for us. 
[01:14:00]  They want us to have a Phillies game.  They want us to broadcast live.  We left, obviously, two days down there.  Then you've got the tour.  Yeah, I looked at our pending schedule and was like, geez, this doesn't leave much time  for even sleep.  For breathing.  For even sleep.  Well, it's going to be very exciting.  So we love going down to Philly.  Keep listening to YSP.  They'll have all the details on what's going to happen next week, late next week, okay?  Right.  Yeah, Car Crash Comedy is the big one.  We've got to find someone to open up the show down there in Philly.  That coward, whoever his name was. 
[01:14:30]  I forgot already.  Whatever.  I don't want to lie.  I'm not afraid.  Shut up.  We're trying to get Logan on the phone.  He's going to explain the Fox thing.  You're just tuning in.  Fox told us to stop playing their stinger.  We've been playing it for a while, man.  It's part of public, like popular, what the hell's the word I'm looking for?  Culture.  Thank you.  Ding. 
[01:15:00]  Popular culture.  That stinger.  What stinger?  It's known as that one.  See?  And they didn't take kindly to the fact that we used it over and over again during our elevator  coverage when one of our boys was stuck in an elevator before break.  We had an intern stuck in an elevator, and we kept checking back to him, and we just used  the stinger, the alert stinger, probably no more than they do over there.  And by the way, the intern, because a lot of people came up to me during break, whatever 
[01:15:30]  happened to him, he died.  Yeah, he died in there.  Yeah.  Suffocated.  It was very, very tragic for him and his family, but we don't really care.  Not real tragic for us, though, because the show goes on.  We haven't missed a beat.  I don't care.  All right.  I got my cantaloupe.  But anyway, during that coverage, we used the Fox stinger over and over and over again,  and Fox got really pissed that they called Eric Logan, the guy that really runs XM Satellite Radio.  Why won't Eric come on? 
[01:16:00]  Oh.  He's right here.  Elo.  Hi, guys.  Welcome back.  Hi, boss.  It's Elo.  Hello, Ant.  How are you?  Good.  I'm too bad I missed you at our lovely dinner down here, by the way.  Yes, I had to.  What did I have to do?  Nothing.  I don't remember.  You had nothing to do.  I had something to do.  All right.  My girl had her gallbladder taken out.  We went back to the room and ate it.  With a nice guillotine. 
[01:16:30]  First of all, you're assuming Fox News is mad.  I think that, listen, they've asked us not to do it.  I got the phone call.  Wait, wait.  Wait.  This just in, Eric Logan says Fox News mad, but have not asked us to not use it.  All right.  Okay.  And now, this just in, we have Elo on the phone saying this.  Yes.  Huh?  Stop using the sounder.  Now we're being told not, all right, this just in, we're being told not to use the sounder? 
[01:17:00]  Don't use the sounder.  Wait a minute.  Why?  What sounder?  This sounder?  Wait, this one?  Or this one?  I think it would be anything that would classify as a Fox News sounder.  All right.  Now, why?  Is this breaking news?  What happened?  This is exactly what, I got a phone call.  We're getting an important, and Eric Logan got a phone call. 
[01:17:30]  From who?  From who?  From a colleague who is the head of programming at Fox.  Up later, we'll tell you who that colleague was.  No, that's fine.  Oh, we won't?  It's a cover-up between Fox and XM.  Right.  It's a cover-up.  Okay.  He requested.  Uh-huh.  Well, actually, what it was, was that, Dwight, could you ask the boys to stop using it? 
[01:18:00]  And I said, I'd be more than happy to.  He could ask.  This just in, he asked.  So when did you tell him that you have no control over us?  I was sufficiently satisfied with the email dialogue that subsequently ensued after my request.  Yeah.  Which clearly has not happened.  And I anticipate further action and calls from them today.  Further calls?  Further calls.  Wow. 
[01:18:30]  That's breaking news.  Yeah.  Further calls.  And we'll tell you what is in those calls later in the program.  During your top secret phone call, did you tell them that, look, I can't control these guys.  Did you call us a-holes?  You know, those.  Oh.  I said, there's no need to take it any further.  I'll make it go away.  So clearly, I've demonstrated the fact that I can't.  Elo powerless.  As they go into merger talks. 
[01:19:00]  There are some things which I can exert enormous amounts of control, and there's others where I have zero, and here we are at zero.  I can't wait to see your inbox.  Were you and him actually talking through email, or were you just kind of like talking under the stall?  Tapping your feet and rubbing the bottom of the partition.  Partition.  I didn't mean that.  I had my iPod on you. 
[01:19:30]  Tap, tap, tap.  Did you know about that tap, tap, tap thing, Elo?  I can't comment on it.  Oh.  Elo embroiled in a sex scandal.  We did notice how many times I went to the bathroom at Charlie Palmer's with Don Wicklin, though.  Oh, Don Wicklin.  Elo calling Don Wicklin gay.  Wicklin has a partition in his office, separating it from the other cubicle.  You look at my new office, Jimmy. 
[01:20:00]  There's a big, you only see like the bottom two inches of my feet.  Oh.  There's a big hole between his office and the one next to it.  One of the greatest Elo moments ever was our whole staff was like at lunch or something  and Don Wicklin was there and Don decided he was going to announce that he got engaged to everyone  and Elo, I think he might have had a few wobbly pops.  He goes, but I thought you were gay.  He said it in front of the entire staff.  Wait, wasn't that on the air? 
[01:20:30]  How embarrassing.  Well, now it is, but.  No, no, no.  Oh, but I think that was on the air, actually.  No, no, no.  We told, the story was at lunch and then we told the story.  Oh, then we told it on the air.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, my God.  Well, you know.  Thanks for the breaking news there.  Yeah.  Thank you, Elo.  That was, that was.  I just, I'm just, I'll let you know when I get the phone call from Fox where they,  I take the next step of action to make us stop doing it because it is their trademark  and it's not fair use.  Is it?  We can't legally use it.  We can't.  Are you sure?  Watch, because all I got to do is that. 
[01:21:00]  Like, I just got to hit a button.  No, you can't.  I know it's a button to you, but it's their trademark, so you can't use it.  Yeah, well, enjoy the two hours of phone calls that we just gave you.  Yeah, as if I had nothing else to do today.  Hey, how come they can use images of ONA, but ONA can't use something from them?  Yeah.  Well, I think it has everything to do with what is news and that is their trademark.  The images, the images, you guys are public figures.  That sounder is not a public image or a public sounder. 
[01:21:30]  It is their proprietary sounder.  CNN can't use it.  This one?  Or this one?  I'm not sure, but I think both of them would qualify.  Oh, damn it.  I was hoping to get one.  Who owns this?  I don't know.  You can use that one all you want.  Yeah.  I don't want to.  Maybe that one could be for the breaking.  I'm excited about the news.  What's the big story of the show?  That we can't use that.  And stop hitting the button. 
[01:22:00]  Stop it.  Oh.  What button?  That one.  No, I think you were talking about the other one.  That one you can still use.  That one you can use.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You mean this one, right?  That one you can use all the time.  Use that one all you want.  All right.  Just not this one.  Or this one.  I hope it's not per occurrence.  It's going to cost you guys a bundle.  Yes, Elo. 
[01:22:30]  Sorry, I couldn't hear you.  Okay.  My phone's ringing.  That's a problem.  Elo's phone ringing.  Tell you about it.  Call us back with the update.  Well, if I still have an update to give you, I'll call you back.  All right, Elo.  All right.  Well, I'll call you back.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, Eric.  There he goes.  That was Elo.  Oh, I smell meeting.  E-Rock?  What do you got for us today?  E-Rock.  Hello.  Hi, E-Rock. 
[01:23:00]  How was your vacation?  It's our own Eric.  I heard you had a fine date at SummerSlam with our own Sam.  That I did.  You went to SummerSlam.  SummerSlam.  SummerSlam.  I would call it SummerSlam.  SummerSlam with Sam.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, it was a lot of fun.  Was it?  Mm-hmm.  Sam?  How was SummerSlam with E-Rock?  It was great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you remember, just before break, we got, what, two tickets to SummerSlam? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Actually, we got one ticket to SummerSlam.  Oh, really?  And then we kind of bitched about it.  There was one ticket in an envelope that had already been opened, and then another one put  in the pocket, or at the house of the staff member who had received the two tickets.  Ah.  The weeks before.  Two whole tickets.  After all that promoting we did for-  There we go.  WWE.  That's good.  Wonderful.  They were good tickets.  Yeah, but-  Maybe the others were lost in the big fire, the fire in the limo. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  But here's the problem.  The events got blown up.  Sam, huge wrestling fan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rock, huge wrestling fan.  Yes.  What to do.  What to do.  Yeah.  So they had to go together.  Yeah.  They went together.  And I would imagine both were not happy about that, right?  It was all right.  Yeah.  You two aren't the best of friends.  Did you tap your feet next to each other's seats?  Where'd you guys meet?  Did you guys go together, or did you meet there?  No, no, no.  We met at the seats there.  Yeah.  You didn't travel together?  Nah. 
[01:24:30]  Why would they?  What a couple of dicks going to an event together, they just meet there.  You met there?  Yeah.  I was already there.  I got there a little early, and he was-  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the phone call to E-Rock.  Ah, E-Rock probably called and said, let's go together.  And you're like, ah, I just happen to be a mile from the stadium.  Yeah.  I'll meet you there.  Yeah.  Now, I'm not really-  I don't know a lot of what's going on.  Mm-hmm.  But I do know that there was like a big moment.  Yeah, there was at SummerSlam. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  The big advertised moment was Triple H's return.  Triple H's return.  So this is like the big moment in SummerSlam.  Like eight or nine months.  Right.  It was like since January.  One muscle ripped off his body that had a heel.  Yeah.  There's only something like sick happening with him.  I'm sure there's music, right?  Oh, yeah.  The entrance was the-  I mean, the entrance music probably started and it was like, wow, like the place goes  wild.  So when you talk about SummerSlam, this is the big, like we like to say, the big get. 
[01:25:30]  This is the reason to go.  This is going to be the one thing everyone talks about that went to SummerSlam.  This is watching the Grand Slam, watching the knockout, watching the, you know, this is  the park.  Like if you go to the message boards and stuff and find out what happened at SummerSlam,  this would be the headline, right?  Yeah.  The crowd went wild.  Okay.  Wow.  Don't even really remember much of, uh, much else that really went on during SummerSlam.  Not even the match really.  Just the fact that nobody had even seen him.  He hadn't come out for an interview.  He hadn't come out, yeah, for nothing. 
[01:26:00]  Nothing.  Just the big, finally, there he is in person.  And there he was.  Yeah.  Pretty huge.  Yeah.  I mean, he got a little smaller, but still huge.  I mean, he's a big guy.  He is a big guy.  He did his thing where he spits the water and everything.  Oh, no.  Did he?  Sure.  Wow.  His big entrance.  And, E-Rock, what did you think of the whole thing?  E-Rock, uh, yeah, we got Sam's take on it, which is great.  Yeah, what did you think of the whole Triple H coming back?  Yeah, how was that?  Wrestling for the first time in nine months.  Um, I was at the top of the stairs.  Being held back by the guy who checks your ticket for the right section. 
[01:26:30]  Because, um, I was getting a pretzel.  You were getting two pretzels.  Yeah.  And, um.  You big.  And because the lights were off, they wouldn't let anybody walk down the stairs.  Oh, fat boy needed a snack at that time.  Boy, you need a little snacky to tie you over.  Aw, sweetie.  Two of those giant pretzels and a big ass.  And a big, with a souvenir cup, big, big souvenir cup of soda. 
[01:27:00]  And you need a wheelbarrow to bring back to your seat.  You're like wobbling, trying to pull your ticket out with two fingers as the guy's telling you no.  Chubby wrestling fan trying to get back.  Oh, and there's the big moment where Triple H comes out for the first time.  There he is with a huge soda and two pretzels at the top of the stairs.  He's trying to clap with a soda under his arm.  By the way, these guys had amazing seats.  Well, that Sam took advantage of.  Yeah.  I didn't want to, like, I wanted to not come back and make fun of E-Rock at all. 
[01:27:30]  Because, you know, he did some stuff for me and, you know, talked to the guys and got the tickets and everything.  And then he was gone.  He was like, I'm just going to get some food.  And I was like, okay.  And then, you know, Triple H's opponent came out.  And I was like, if he misses, then I have to bring it to somebody.  And then Triple H's music hit.  And then he came back to the seat once Triple H was firmly in the ring with his two pretzels and jumbo soda. 
[01:28:00]  I come running back.  I'm like, I hear the other guy come to the ring.  And I'm like, all right, I'm just going to make it.  Triple H's music hits.  The guy puts his arm out right in front of me.  He says, you have to wait until the lights come on.  So I'm standing there peeking from the curtain, watching Triple H walk back to the ring.  Did you have your Hulk outfit on at this point?  Your Hulkster in heaven shirt?  No, but Sam was proudly wearing a SummerSlam t-shirt.  Oh.  I wasn't wearing it.  I bought it.  I don't wear the shirt to the event. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, that's silly.  Yeah.  When that happens, right?  Yeah.  You and your two pretzels.  Did you call Dr. Smith and spit in his face before you did that?  That's not on the...  You put a diet book up and throw it out?  That's not on the Fat Smash diet there, E-Rock.  That's what they're getting at.  What was going through your mind when you walked up to that concession stand and said,  oh, those pretzels look good.  I'll have a pretzel.  Wait.  I love his arms.  Wait, wait.  He told us before break, F the diet.  Yeah.  Okay, what were you thinking?  Let me have two.  I didn't have lunch that day, so I'm kind of starving. 
[01:29:00]  So I was like, all right, I'll get two pretzels.  And then I start running back.  Oh, we know that part.  I just want to know what's going on at the concession stand.  What other...  The concession stand was directly next to our gate.  Oh, really?  Oh, that must have been handy.  Did you have other fine dining while you were there?  No, that was it.  That was it?  Yeah.  You got the sound effect, the fox thing?  Oh, what?  This one?  This just in.  Wrestling is fake. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  Iraq is a carb whore.  Iraq, anything else you want to talk about?  Sam made a friend at SummerSlam.  He was very chummy with this little four or five-year-old heavy Hispanic kid dressed as  Ray Mysterio.  Yeah.  He was flipping out the whole time, so I was trying to...  He was a creep.  Iraq, though, also made a friend.  He was sitting next to the guy who won the WWE's biggest fan contest.  Oh, no!  He was sitting next to Iraq. 
[01:30:00]  And this guy was from California, I guess.  And he happened to work in radio.  And Travis thought that I should bring to everyone's attention that I made the observation  that it was Bizarro Iraq from the West Coast.  Bizarro Iraq.  But, so, I'm talking to the guy.  He's telling me about the contest, how much money he won.  So, I tell him who I am, where I'm from.  He heard the Friday show.  He's like, yeah, about Mick Foley.  Everyone was talking about it over the weekend at this FanFest thing that they had in New York. 
[01:30:30]  Of course they were.  I go, oh, really?  I grabbed Sam's arm.  I'm like, this is the guy.  So, now the guy's talking over me trying to meet Sam.  Can I ask why you'd ever admit to that guy that you were in radio?  Why wouldn't?  Were you trying to impress him?  Yes.  Yes!  He should have only seen this side of your face.  Why would you even acknowledge him?  Exactly why?  Why?  He was talking to him through the entrance of the main event and through the mansion.  He was talking.  They were having a conversation. 
[01:31:00]  I'd rather talk to a little, mysterious kid.  That kid ruled.  Hey, have you given back the money to Dr. Ian Smith yet?  No.  Yeah.  That's going to have to happen.  I think that was going to pan out.  We do have to take a break.  Oh, damn.  Come on.  The big show announcement next, finally?  There is.  Come on.  There's a huge, huge, huge announcement, right?  Yeah.  Biggie, biggie.  A big announcement from one of the staff members.  Yep.  And, uh...  Can we just do it next?  Can we go into lockdown?  Let's just...  Lockdown mode. 
[01:31:30]  Lockdown.  Where's the lockdown?  I don't know.  Let me find lockdown.  Oh, I got it.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, that's not lockdown.  I'm sorry, Elo.  I'm sorry.  It said lockdown.  Here it is.  Oh, Elo.  I'm sorry.  Damn.  Ah, yes.  It's called Fair Use.  Thank you, dude, on your mobile.  You cannot trademark sounds.  You copyright then and use in a parody.  What?  You cannot trademark sounds.  You copyright then and use in a parody.  It's called Fair Use Fox is a Box of C's. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Here's...  We're going into lockdown.  Lockdown.  After the break, someone on staff has a huge announcement.  We go right to it.  Yes.  Lockdown.  See?  Oh, lockdown.  Lockdown.  It's an opium, Anthony.  Lockdown.  It's an opium, Anthony.  Lockdown.  No new material.  Well, we do this because we all have ADD.  Lockdown.  No phone calls.  Don't look at the instant feedback.  That's it.  Wow.  Don't look at the websites. 
[01:32:30]  No one leaves this room.  Steve going back into the closet.  See?  We're taking the whole studio down to the basement of this fine building.  We're in lockdown mode.  After the break, someone has a big announcement on this fine radio show.  Okay?  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back from vacation. 
[01:33:00]  Well rested.  Last time we spoke, we were a day away from the PNC show.  The ONA travel and virus comedy show at the PNC was a huge success.  Okay.  Something like 12,000 people were there after you count the comps and all that.  We got one more show down there in Philly, what, a week from this Saturday?  15th.  It is, yes, 15th.  And that'll be it.  We told everyone to write down something that happened to them on vacation. 
[01:33:30]  We were supposed to have a special guest on the traveling virus in Jersey, but he canceled  on us.  What happened?  We were going to surprise everybody with Brian Regan.  Hey.  I guess we could say it, right?  Yeah.  What happened?  Then there was some kind of conflict at the last minute.  I don't know what happened.  We thought that would be a great thing for everybody in Jersey.  Yeah.  Will there be a surprise in Philly?  You never know.  Yeah, Lewis came.  Lewis Black was great. 
[01:34:00]  Lewis Black.  Oh, yeah.  Anyone else notice the huge tour bus that Lewis had out back?  Yeah.  Everyone else is like, you know, carpooling and taking buses back to the city.  And all of a sudden, Lewis is like, well, see you guys later.  And he jumps into this massive tour bus with other cars following him, and he took off.  And he actually only sits in the front seat with the bus driver.  The rest is used for booze and cigarettes.  What an alky.  I love him.  I'm so glad lockdown works so well.  All right.  All right. 
[01:34:30]  That's hysterical.  We're in lockdown.  All right.  All right.  You guys suck.  We do have a quickie, though.  We got to get to it.  Miss Teen South Carolina answers a question.  I can't believe you.  They did the Miss Teen thing.  But we were in lockdown.  And Miss Teen South Carolina answers a question.  Oh, this is good.  She's actually a bright girl.  Yeah, listen to this.  Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S. on a world map.  Why do you think this is? 
[01:35:00]  I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have maps.  And I believe that our education, like, such as in South Africa and the Iraq, everywhere, like, such as.  And I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S. or should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries. 
[01:35:30]  So we will be able to build up our future for our children.  Thank you very much, South Carolina.  Oh, but she's adorable.  But she's adorable.  Holy mother of our Lord.  Let me see her because she is dumb as dirt.  She gets a pass, though.  Look at her.  What a dunce.  Holy Jesus, is she a babe.  She is lovely, but she could be the dumbest person in the world.  What?  That could have been the most babbling explanation of anything I've ever heard. 
[01:36:00]  She's, like, dyslexic and nervous.  Oh, it was everything.  What'd she say?  Wow.  What was her answer?  Such as?  Something like there's not enough maps in the world or something?  Well, South Africa.  South Africa and Asia needs our maps.  So United States Americans, U.S. Americans.  Well, no, she said a lot of people don't have maps.  I don't know what it is.  Enough about the map.  Take your clothes off. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  She definitely gets by on those looks, man.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She ended a sentence with such as.  Such as.  Such as.  Such as my and my.  Do you want to hear that again?  That's what it should have been.  All right.  Let's hear that.  Yeah, please.  Let me hear that and I want to see her as she says it.  Because she is a dope.  Have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S. on a world map.  Why do you think this is?  I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out. 
[01:37:00]  U.S. Americans.  Let's let's let's.  U.S. Americans.  The answer was.  Like there's other Americans, not.  Well, there's Central Americans, I would guess, South Americans.  Yeah.  We're talking about the United States.  You said U.S. Americans.  U.S. Americans.  Listen.  That U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't 
[01:37:30]  have that.  Some people.  And I believe that our education, like such as South Africa and the Iraq, everywhere like  Iraq, such as, and I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S. should  help the U.S. or should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries.  So we will be able to build up our future for our children.  Thank you very much.  So will what the future blow up? 
[01:38:00]  Build up.  Oh, build up.  Build up our future.  Wasn't it one in five Americans can't find?  Yes.  Yeah, that's.  So why is she talking about the rest of the world?  Because she's a dope.  She is an idiot.  And if you notice in the clip, at the very end of the clip, when the announcer comes in  and tells her, thank you very much, you could just see the look on his face.  It's just.  Oh, he's like, thank you very much.  He's dummy.  And you know what that look was?  We made you two.  You know, me being a vagina American, I'm stupid.  As he was talking, he should have just put the mic cord around her neck and just slowly 
[01:38:30]  tightened it.  Oh, darn.  He from Connecticut.  I'm guessing she's part of that one fifth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So does everyone have their announcements in from?  She gets by on her looks.  All right.  Where's the announcements?  Here's the announcements.  All right.  We got the announcement.  The official.  The hat of announcements.  Some will be bigger than others, I believe.  Oh, yeah.  But we all have something from our vacation, I guess, to share.  All right. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Well, the first one has been pulled out of the hat.  I'll go back at that.  I don't know.  Are you going back with that one?  Because I don't want it to be obvious.  All right.  Now we're going to start over.  I don't want it to start.  Okay.  Went to...  Sorry.  Went to Disney World and got lots of Disney character pictures. 
[01:39:30]  Don't raise your hand in the studio.  I think I know who that is.  All right.  We've got to read all of them.  This is for the audience.  All right.  All right.  What is...  Just got to read them.  I effed...  No.  Stop it.  I effed... 
[01:40:00]  Well, that's a derogatory term for a certain ethnic race.  It says, I effed...  Yeah.  And you can fill in the blank.  Fill in the blank there.  Beep your horn if you think you know.  Someone in this room had sex with...  Someone.  Someone else.  This happened to someone on vacation.  I would guess that is.  Mick Foley said he was my friend.  Aww.  Who said that?  I wonder who that is. 
[01:40:30]  I struck out...  There's another announcement from vacation.  I struck out?  I struck out with an entire bar full of women and punched a light post.  All right.  I think I know who that is.  Wow.  Another one coming in?  I certainly know who it's not.  Another one coming in?  I called my mother a sociopath and she walked out of the restaurant.  I hope everyone's keeping track of these and trying to put them together. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  It's like one of those tests where you have the statements and then the people's names  and you got to show a line between each one.  All right.  Like an old test in the fifth grade.  Moving on.  Took picture of underage girl in bikini.  There's a lot of illegal activity going on here. 
[01:41:30]  I fucked, uh...  You don't...  Hey!  Hey!  How about potty mouth on the air?  I had a good line, too, but I just messed that one up.  I hope the new dump guy got it.  I hope he wasn't yawning with his arms over his head.  By the way, we don't have Al anymore.  No.  Yeah, breaking in the new dump guy. 
[01:42:00]  Al decided to work for Boomer Esiason.  What a dumb move that was.  I hope Boomer punches him.  If he did make...  The next announcement from vacation.  Did the guy get it?  The new guy?  Yeah.  What's his name?  Jiven.  Oh, Jiven.  Oh, good work, Jiven.  Brother.  Brother, brother.  Brother, Jiven.  Jiven?  What kind of name is Jiven?  I got that on my shoe in a rest area.  I'm like, hey.  Hey, I was just tapping into my iPod.  Now I got some Jiven on my shoe. 
[01:42:30]  What were you doing?  Your breath smells like Jiven.  The next announcement over a break here.  I told my girlfriend to get all of her crap out of my apartment.  Wow.  This is a mystery.  Another one from vacation.  Someone typed it.  Oh, it has to be Kenny.  Went to a foreign country on vacation. 
[01:43:00]  Tight.  Anonymous.  And finally, I got engaged.  These are the announcements from vacation.  Wow.  That's a biggie.  These are the announcements from vacation.  That's not, that's a biggie. 
[01:43:30]  Hmm.  There you go.  I'm looking, let me look around the room.  Who got engaged over a break?  Let me see if a lot of people were betting I was the one with the underage picture.  All right.  So once again, here's the announcements.  They're betting it was you.  I'm wishing it was me.  Went to Disney World and got lots of Disney character pictures. 
[01:44:00]  Went to a foreign country on vacation.  I told my girlfriend to get all of her crap out of my apartment.  Took picture of underage girl in bikini.  A very busy vacation here.  I called my mother, a sociopath, and she walked out of the restaurant we were in.  McFoley said he was my friend.  I struck out with an entire bar full of women and punched a light post.  I got engaged, and I effed a... 
[01:44:30]  Somebody of a different race.  So how are we going to do this?  All right.  How are we going to do this?  Because obviously the big one is all...  That's a life-changing event.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely, because if you date like that, people look at you weird.  Exactly. 
[01:45:00]  How are we going to do this?  Hmm.  Can we all guess?  Yeah.  It'll take some time.  Hey, the answer to feedback is hilarious.  Opie is the voyeur, so I say he is the pedophile snapping pics of kids.  F you, Kevin.  Someone's saying Disney was Anthony, because a lot of people know that you like going to  Disney, Ants.  Yes, I do.  Jim Norton and the apartment one.  That's from Burton, Philly. 
[01:45:30]  Hmm.  Wow.  Who got engaged?  A lot of people are speculating I got engaged.  A lot of people speculating.  A lot of people speculating that I was the one that effed a...  Big duties, Jay.  I was in a very romantic place.  Yeah?  Casino?  Yeah.  I consider it romantic.  I have a love of money. 
[01:46:00]  Hmm.  A lot of speculating going on.  How are we going to do this?  Someone's suggesting that one of those is Sam's girlfriend that put in a suggestion.  The lovely Jess would never do that.  Well, we could get...  Call him that evil word.  Well, we could get two out of the way. 
[01:46:30]  How about we get two out of the way?  Okay.  We'll do the rest after break, because we got...  The obvious one here is Mick Foley said he was my friend.  Yeah.  That's so obvious, Sam.  It's got to be Sam.  He already said he went to SummerSlam.  He did.  He said he was my friend at the virus tour.  It was great.  Oh, it's a virus tour.  Yeah, we were talking backstage, me and Mick.  And, yeah.  He said he was my friend.  How did that go down?  He just out of nowhere said he was your friend?  Well, no, because he said something to me about my diet or something. 
[01:47:00]  And then I said, yeah, yeah.  And then I said, I'm telling all these guys that we're friends now.  And then he said, we are friends.  Oh.  What's he going to say?  That's cute.  I was like, this is great.  Look at the nice casual picture of them just talking backstage.  That's nice.  And, you know what's funny?  Mick had a moment backstage at PNC.  He was talking to some of the exotic dancers.  Yes.  And they were huge fans of Mick Foley.  Who isn't?  Well, he walked to his car to get action figures for the exotic dancers kid. 
[01:47:30]  Did he F a, um.  No, no.  Hey.  Okay.  I'm just, I don't know.  I don't know who's writing these things.  The, uh, I F'd a blank.  Is that a real one or does someone like get.  Is someone being silly?  Oh, boy.  What?  Come on.  What?  Well, can I say who raised their hand? 
[01:48:00]  Well, I was reaching for something.  I was waving.  Tim.  Jimmy raised his hand.  I don't know what that means.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't want to know.  I don't want to know.  Did it involve foot tapping?  No.  No.  Oh, okay.  But perhaps a little, uh, a little.  Meep, meep.  Oh, okay.  Wow. 
[01:48:30]  How, uh, how was it?  Expensive.  Oh.  Are you serious?  Oh, well, you know.  Well, then you can't be the other one.  Right.  That's interesting.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, hold on a second.  Are you tired of singles bars?  Are you looking for a sure thing? 
[01:49:00]  Introducing Anthony Cumia's seminar for man-on-man bathroom sex.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  You're cruising the urinals, and there's someone beside you that you think is hot.  You might just give him a glance and see if he, uh, can strike eye contact.  In his seminar, Anthony will instruct you how to find the best places to go.  A good way to find out whether a restroom is cruisy.  Look for graffiti on the stall walls.  He'll even give you insider tips on how to find that special partner. 
[01:49:30]  If there's someone beside you, try tapping your foot once.  It's man-on-man gay bathroom sex with Anthony Cumia.  Now he moves his foot over and touches the other guy's foot.  When this touch is made and then no one moves away, I would like some gay bathroom sex.  What?  You're not a tapper?  Anthony Cumia has other methods of making yourself known.  Clearing your throat can also be a good way of letting others know. 
[01:50:00]  Anthony Cumia's seminar for man-on-man bathroom sex.  You gotta jiggle the bait around, or else the fish ain't gonna bite.  Now, in a rest stop near you.  I can just see the fun that's gonna happen in the bathrooms here today.  Ha ha ha!  Very good.  Alright, Tim.  Alright, my new seminar.  Yeah.  It's great.  Keep that close.  We'll play that one again.  Alright, we'll get this one out of the way, too.  Went to a foreign country on vacation.  I went to Niagara Falls. 
[01:50:30]  Ha ha ha!  Did you lift up his right leg first?  What?  Forget it.  It's an old rhyme.  Yeah.  Oh, slowly I turned?  No.  No.  How was Niagara Falls?  It was a cool thing to see.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's really nice to see.  Was that the first time you were in a foreign country?  No.  No, I've been there before, and I've been to a couple others.  But that's the best I could, you know, come up with for this thing. 
[01:51:00]  Did you do the Maid of the Mist?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was pretty cool.  Did you go to the museum and look at all the people that went over the falls?  Yeah, that's...  You have a nice museum there, right?  Yeah, and you go through the tunnels behind the falls, and they have all the pictures  of all the people, and...  Oh, wow.  You know, they have one of those sky things.  You go up...  How long was the Maid of the Mist ride?  No, it's like a half hour.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to put on...  They give you a raincoat, because you get soaking wet.  Well, they gave you that, so you didn't soak up the whole falls in your hair. 
[01:51:30]  If I can remember, they tell you, like, how much water goes over the falls, like, per  minute, but I don't remember.  It's a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just leave it at that.  It's too big for you to figure out.  Yeah, it is something I recommend.  Everybody should see that once in their life.  Yeah.  Tomorrow on the show, can we, like, wet down your head?  All right.  We really want to see what it looks like.  I'm looking at...  All right.  So, you went to a foreign country, also known as Niagara Falls, which is probably 100 yards 
[01:52:00]  from America.  Jesus.  Wow.  Well, it's actually a foot from America, or an inch, if you really think about it.  So, you stay in a nice place, nice place?  Oh, yeah.  On the Canadian side, it's got nice hotels.  My hotel was right across from the falls, had a beautiful view.  Did you go up the CN Tower?  No.  Where's that?  Toronto.  Isn't that in Toronto where you are?  No, no, no.  Toronto's still, like, if I remember from back in the day, it's still a two-hour ride 
[01:52:30]  or something.  Oh, okay.  This is like, I flew to Buffalo, rented a car, you drive a half hour, boom, you're there.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Boom.  I went to a foreign country, Buffalo.  It's pretty much North Buffalo.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but you got to, like, go through customs, and the Canadian custom woman was so annoyed  at me.  Yeah.  Why?  Because you go, they're like a toll booth kind of thing.  Yeah.  Toll booths.  But you're, you know, like, you used to drive in, like, in New York, going through the toll  booths.  You're, like, right on everybody's bumper. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  But you got to stay back and stop, because there's cameras that, like, take pictures of  the license plate.  Right, yeah.  And when I went through, I was right on the guy's bumper, and boy, did she chastise me.  Like, hey, hey, hey, here.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, she's like, you know, you didn't see the stop sign.  I'm like, nah, I didn't, you know.  And you do know that Niagara Falls is actually in New York, right?  Yeah, but I was.  You didn't really go to Niagara Falls.  I was on the other side.  Well, I guess maybe you could go, but not really.  There's not much to go.  The actual Niagara Falls is in New York. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, but I went on both sides.  There's not much to go.  You saw the other side.  On the New York side.  The New York side blows.  There's not much to go.  Man, do they get.  Terrible.  Boy, do they get screwed as far as that whole thing goes.  Yeah.  They would love that money coming in, pouring in.  Yeah.  How long do you get through our customs?  It's like 45 minutes, an hour, and you're stuck on a bridge, you know.  I'm thinking like the bridge that just collapsed in that other place.  It's the Peace Bridge? 
[01:54:00]  Rainbow Bridge.  Rainbow?  I think there's a Peace Bridge, too, that you could cross to.  Yeah.  But then you got to go up the river, I think.  Me and Otto walked across that bridge.  Nice.  We were doing a Buffalo gig many years ago.  It was so unromantic.  I'm that stupid ventriloquist hiking across the bridge, looking at water and walking back.  Please don't call him a ventriloquist.  Please don't call him a ventriloquist.  There's a nice new casino in Niagara Falls.  Maybe you could play it.  They got a nice showroom and everything.  Yeah.  Hey, Alex from New York City, it's a few gallons of water that goes over the falls.  That's a lot more.  Perhaps it's more than that.  Perhaps more than that, Jim. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  So Kenny was the one.  Wow.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Who knew it would be Kenny that went to a foreign country?  All right.  So what's left?  All right.  What's left for there after the break?  The biggie.  The big get.  I got engaged.  The big one is the someone got engaged.  Took picture of underage girl in bikini.  Right.  I called my mother a sociopath and she walked out of the restaurant.  Okay.  I told my girlfriend to get all of her crap out of my apartment.  Right.  I struck out with an entire bar full of women and punched a light post. 
[01:55:00]  I have to.  All right.  Did that one already.  Yeah.  You got that one.  And went to Disney World and got lots of Disney character pictures.  Mm-hmm.  We'll figure out who wrote all those down after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Is that true?  They dumped out of that?  He did not have to dump that. 
[01:55:30]  It's not illegal.  That's part of the whole bit, you dummies.  God.  It came from Tom.  One of Tom's big no-nos.  Yeah.  Well, I understand that.  But what you're saying right there is not illegal.  I can understand.  Yeah.  It's dirty.  I can understand that.  But if it's on the background of a picture, you know, that's what I'm...  And there's clothing on.  Yeah.  And there's no sexual...  It's a beach.  For the love of God. 
[01:56:00]  That's annoying.  And somebody's taking pictures of people, and in the background there's something that  you see later on.  Oh, God.  Give me a break.  That's ridiculous.  All right.  Well, we'll throw that one to the side for now.  Sure.  We'll figure out what to do with that one.  We're in the middle of reading...  Oh, God.  Reading things.  Effing radio.  Reading things that happened to the staff over vacation.  And then we're trying to figure out who did what.  Jackasses. 
[01:56:30]  The next one is I went to Disney World and got lots of Disney character pictures.  Whoever that is should be shot.  I would think Ant's because Ant likes the Disney.  No, that ain't me.  But I know where you went on vacation, so I'm out.  I'm out.  You were in the Bahamas doing the...  Yeah, I took a picture of an old man bending over and showing his yam bag in a Speedo.  That's what I took a picture of.  Since I can't say what I did take a picture of on the radio. 
[01:57:00]  Holy mother of Christ.  You weren't saying anything sexual.  You weren't saying anything inappropriate.  Of course I wasn't.  I'm taking a picture of everyone I'm hanging out with.  And in the background was a girl probably 15 years old in a bikini.  There you go.  You're going to dump out of that too?  Is that a biggie?  Is that a biggie, Tom?  Jesus Christ.  It's not like I said anything bad or wrong.  A Chris Hansen is going to bash in the door here. 
[01:57:30]  Or I was setting up a photo studio somewhere in a seedy hotel.  Holy Christ almighty.  Give me a break.  The word underage can imply 17 years old.  17.  Hell, they had the Miss Teen contest, right?  That's right.  And they were all in bikinis.  Are they all 18?  Is that the age of the Miss Teen?  Yeah, break.  I don't know.  Whatever.  No.  How about this?  If JonBenet Ramsey were one of those photo things, one of those kid pageants, you could 
[01:58:00]  say I took a picture of an underage girl in a cowboy hat.  Is that going to get dumped too?  Yeah.  When it's a perfectly allowed thing?  That'll get dumped.  All right.  I don't know.  Got to have a little chat, I think.  Because I think, again, personal feelings are getting in the way of this radio show.  If someone's got a problem with that, I would understand, put the way it is.  But that's called radio.  It's called making it sound real funny and kind of, you know, intriguing. 
[01:58:30]  Something the listener will go, holy Jesus, who did that?  Not like I'm setting up a tripod in my hotel room and leading him in with popcorn, you dumbass.  What a dummy.  Cotton candy.  Cotton candy.  Whatever.  Whatever.  What did the witch use for Hansel and Gretel?  That's why I had Hansel and Gretel, and then I put them in the oven.  But no one likes popcorn in that movie anymore.  No.  I will be honest, though.  Maybe at a movie.  That's about it.  I found jujubees to be very effective.  Yes.  What a bunch of dummies. 
[01:59:00]  What a bunch of scared dunces.  Yep.  A bunch of frightened little men.  Enough.  All right.  On the instant feedback, we got Dennis D. from Jersey.  He writes, well, that's, oh, okay.  I talked about Kenny going to a foreign country.  He went to Niagara Falls.  Yeah.  And Dennis writes, well, that's not appropriate at all.  Kenny's stuck on a rainbow bridge.  You didn't like the name of the bridge, right, Kenny?  We know where your head's at with things.  You weren't too happy that you were stuck on a rainbow bridge.  Because rainbows are bright and cheery. 
[01:59:30]  No, I was just nervous because the bridge just collapsed, and they got all that weight  on the bridge from all the cars waiting to go through customs both sides.  Oh.  Scary.  Yeah.  All right.  And he also writes, Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Ah, the first one after the break, after the big vacation.  Here it is from Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Kenny went to Canada but never left the state of confusion.  That's good.  All right.  Well, moving on.  Who went to Disney World and got lots of Disney character pictures? 
[02:00:00]  Iraq?  No.  Iraq, where did you go to vacation?  Um, I went to Disney World.  So is this you?  But this is not me.  No, that is not Iraq.  We have two Disney World travelers on this staff.  That is repugnant.  I go to Disney World.  Three.  Even more repugnant.  And no, I don't go for that.  Jesus.  I dress in a Tigger suit.  Anthony's favorite ride is it's a small world after all. 
[02:00:30]  That's right.  Oh.  Oh, get this.  Where's my camera?  I got to snap some pictures.  I got to shine up my shoes.  Oh, quick.  We're heading into the little Mexican section where they're all wearing sombreros.  Oh, this is wonderful.  Oh, look.  The boat's just zigzagging through.  Is this appropriate if I snap a picture of the It's a Small World ride?  It's a small world, all right.  And a hot one. 
[02:01:00]  Maniacs in this business.  Maniacs.  Shining up your shoes in the hotel room.  Tim was at Disney World as well?  What's wrong with these people?  We're Shark Ducks.  Shark Ducks don't go to Disney World.  Disney World stinks.  All right.  Who got their pictures with the Disney characters?  Yeah, I see Travis walking up to the microphone.  Yes.  Why?  It's fun. 
[02:01:30]  It's not fun.  Who doesn't want their picture with Mickey?  Me.  It's fun.  It's great.  And you know something?  I want to share it with Pal Talk.  Thanks.  There they are.  The wife and I went on our belated honeymoon.  Aw.  All right.  Look, they're wearing the husband and wife little top hat with the ears.  That's what Travis has.  And then the bride veil with the ears.  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:00]  Wait, wait.  Why would you do that?  It's...  And we all now have them as our desktop backgrounds on all our computers in the office.  We have them on our iPhones.  It's just...  It's everywhere.  It's sweeping the nation.  Oh, my God.  Oh, those hats should be removed by Oswald.  White Mickey Mouse ears with a veil and black Mickey Mouse ears with, like, kind of a top  hat thing.  Yeah.  A smaller top hat.  I'll say, she looks very cute.  She's adorable. 
[02:02:30]  You happen to look like the preacher from Poltergeist.  He looks Amish.  God is in his holy tem.  I didn't wear it that long because it didn't...  It was too big for my head.  Well, you wore it long enough to take a picture with every character in Disney.  Well, that's long enough.  Not the hat.  Not the hat.  Not the hat.  My favorite one.  At some point, I guess the photographer said, put your hands together like you're holding  something in your hands, but put your hands together.  So, they did that, and then they superimposed a little cartoon Tinkerbell. 
[02:03:00]  Look, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Look, Jimmy.  There's a little cartoon Tinkerbell in there.  Oh, and if that isn't enough, there's another one where Lisa is, like, cuddling a fake baby  as if you were holding a baby.  And Travis is to look over her shoulder like he is looking at the baby.  And then they superimpose a cartoon of little baby Simba.  Why couldn't they be funny about it and say, okay, look, Lisa, look like you're crying and 
[02:03:30]  stand with your legs apart.  Travis, you stare and look at the floor and then put the baby there.  And she's crying looking down, and your hands are up like, oh, well.  What do I know?  What do I know?  They don't have that sense of humor at Disney.  Yuck.  There it is.  Is there any other ones?  Oh, there's plenty.  I love the fact that Travis...  Are these on the old website?  They're on my MySpace.  What's your MySpace?  Why don't you get a few friends today?  They're adorable. 
[02:04:00]  It's no chances, Travis.  But I can give them to Eric.  He can put them up.  And there's Travis getting a big hug by Mickey.  You don't say no when Mickey asks for a hug.  No, you just punch his stupid mouse face.  You just see that stupid, big, fake shoe tapping underneath a bathroom stall.  He has Dudley Moorfoot shoe.  Mickey has a club foot like good old Dudley.  Old pudding skull.  Hobson, I sneezed and my brain's leaked out of my head. 
[02:04:30]  I've got brain cancer and a club foot.  I'll alert the media.  Will you, you old queen?  I can't remember my own name.  Wow, that's terrific.  All right.  It's a little joke.  Was 10 a movie you did or how many pounds your right shoe weighed? 
[02:05:00]  Old stump foot.  What am I doing?  This is his IQ after the diagnosis.  Should we move on to the next one?  Sure.  All right.  I struck out with an entire bar full of women and punched a light post.  Hmm.  Who's trying to pick up girls failing and getting violent about it?  Barful would be the key.  Barful.  Keyword is bar. 
[02:05:30]  The key word.  Keyword is bar on this one.  Oh, definitely.  I have my pick.  Danny, step up to the mic.  Yeah.  You sure you guys don't want to guess someone else first?  Ah, no.  Not even.  All right.  You got me.  I'm surprised the way you get drunk.  You didn't try to pick up a lamppost and punch a girl.  I may have.  It was one of those nights.  What happened, Danny?  What happened?  Well, I was in Texas. 
[02:06:00]  Why?  Texas?  For vacation.  But why there?  We had three people go to Disney.  What part of Texas?  Austin.  Austin's rocking.  Yeah, it's a pretty sweet town.  So, yeah, I just went there with friends.  You struck out in Austin.  Oh, yeah.  And the girl's actually really cute down there, too.  It's a big college town.  Yeah.  We went to a nice piano bar and sung our brains out and got pretty junk.  What song did you sing?  Oh, everything.  You know, piano bars.  You just sit there and sing along with the guy and the girls. 
[02:06:30]  What happened, though?  What were some of the shoot downs?  It wasn't so much that it was a definitive.  It's like, you know, when you're just kind of standing there and...  Just nothing vibing.  There was conversation, and then now it's just that awkward,  I'm not saying anything, you're not saying anything.  Like, I'm not even going to try to go any further with this,  because I know that I've already lost the battle.  So then you leave, and you're...  Yeah, lots of just, all right, well, I'll catch you guys.  Oh, yeah, I'll catch you.  Actually, there was one part where I had offered to purchase these lovely ladies 
[02:07:00]  a couple of drinks.  Oh, okay.  That's a nice icebreaker.  And they said, oh, you know, we got to go.  And then they...  And then they didn't go.  They got up and left.  You chased them out.  Now, how did you...  When did you punch the light post?  Well, that was when closing time in Austin is pretty early.  It's only 2 o'clock.  Oh, damn.  So we were leaving.  Only a true alcoholic, by the way, says it's pretty early,  because I'm thinking 11.  It's 2 o'clock, like in most places in the country. 
[02:07:30]  Well, I mean, New York.  New York's great.  New York's great, yeah.  So we were headed back to the car, and I was kind of walking ahead,  just not feeling so terrific about myself.  And I threw a fantastic punch at a light post.  And you can kind of see it's still kind of swollen a little bit.  Whoa, it is a little puffy.  Wow, that is puffy.  But that happened a week ago, so it had a whole week to heal up.  Dude.  It just looked like one giant knuckle.  Wow.  And it still hurts.  I'm such an ass.  Yeah, that isn't a good thing to do, is punch something. 
[02:08:00]  No.  You've got to think, one second before you let that punch go,  should I be doing this?  Like, I knew as much.  99% of the time, you'll say no.  As my fist was flying at 40 miles an hour, I was like,  this isn't going to be such a great idea.  By the way, moving backwards, backwards.  Backwards.  The Disney worker found with baby porn.  Yeah.  This is sick.  Well, they should screen anyone who works there relatively carefully.  Of course.  I mean, they'll find a lot of that creep work there.  All right, really, really fast.  A lot of people like putting themselves in those situations. 
[02:08:30]  It's quick.  21-year-old Tony Guerra shook his head and turned away from our camera  as agents from the FBI's Innocent Images Task Force  arrested him at Disney's MGM Studios on Thursday.  A federal search warrant quoted him saying,  I love babies, during a chat session on the photo-sharing website called Hello Google.  Good old Hello Google.  What the hell is that?  It almost sounds like someone just joking.  Well, what's your camera? 
[02:09:00]  But was there pictures exchanged?  They don't just arrest you for saying that.  I love babies.  It was arrested, though, at MGM.  Did, like, Keystone cops come and get him,  and people were taking pictures?  Goofy with a sheriff star.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Brrrr.  An oldie-time car.  Sharing website called Hello Google.  The search warrant said Guerra asked an undercover officer posing as a mother  if she had molested her own children,  then sent 63 still photos and four videos of child pornography  that's too graphic to describe and feature children under the age of six. 
[02:09:30]  What the?  This guy should honestly just have a gun put to his head  and he's just being shot.  He asks one question and then dumps a boatload of porno over the internet line to her.  Well, it wasn't her.  It was an undercover cop.  Yeah, yeah.  I love babies can be a very nice, healthy thing to say.  I love babies.  Aw.  You just said that.  What a creep this guy is.  I've never heard.  He's six.  I swear to God, I've never heard the term baby porn before. 
[02:10:00]  Nah.  Never heard that before until this story hit today.  Investigators said they've already found roughly 5,000 images  as part of a preliminary search of a computer in the Kissimmee apartment  where he's rented a room for the last three months.  A Disney spokesperson told Eyewitness News,  We take allegations like these very seriously.  Tony Guerra has been placed on unpaid administrative leave  pending the outcome of the charges.  Leave.  What's scum?  His name should be Danny Download.  He's a busy boy. 
[02:10:30]  5,000 images.  Good golly.  Jesus.  I don't really...  I think it's disgusting what he likes,  but hats off to the internet connection.  It's obviously very fast.  Wow.  If he's guilty of that,  if that's really his and he's trading those,  they should just put a gun in his head and just shoot him.  Oh, boy.  We got some cliffhangers, don't we?  This is just going to piss off a lot of people.  Well, you went off on the tangent about...  I had to. 
[02:11:00]  I was being dumped out of.  Which was very, very funny.  Unjustly.  Danny's story was interesting.  Kamara on the show.  We had everybody write down something that happened to them on vacation.  Still left.  I got engaged.  I called my mother a sociopath,  and she walked out of the restaurant,  and I told my girlfriend to get all of her crap out of my apartment. 
[02:11:30]  We'll find out the answers tomorrow, I guess.  We ran out of show.  A lot of the stations, they just leave us early, so...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, gotta get to that classic rock in the 90s.  Oh, yeah.  Classic rock that really rocks!  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  Oh, boy, they're going to be mad.  They're already mad.  Oh, boy, they're going to be mad.  All right, guys.  So we got two more hours on XM for the rest of the country? 
[02:12:00]  Yes.  Take care.  See you tomorrow.  And for everybody in Philly especially,  especially, keep listening to WISP.  They got all the details on our big visit  that's going to happen late next week.  Broadcast live Thursday and Friday.  They got the last virus show on Saturday.  Could be the last one for a while.  We might be taking a little break.  So I would encourage people, if you're close to, you know, Camden,  to get yourself a ticket through Ticketmaster.  Virus tour, one word on MySpace for all the info. 
[02:12:30]  All right?  Right.  People are pissed.  Some lockdown.  Oh, they are mad, I know.  We got some of it.  We got the big ones out of the way.  There was still some fun material there, man.  So you got a couple cliffhangers.  We haven't had cliffhangers in a while.  Nothing wrong with a good cliffhanger.  Relax.  Who got engaged?  Huh?  Huh?  Who got engaged?  We'll find out tomorrow.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:00]  The virus is spreading.  Look at us now.  Does it sound all right to you?  I hope so.  Sounds a little bassy.  Here we are on XM Satellite Radio.  With the new equipment and everything and the new studio.  Yeah.  Probably what it is.  Yeah.  We're tweaking and fiddling.  In our brand new XM facilities.  Brand spanking new XM facility. 
[02:13:30]  Like they did.  They promised after their vacation.  They said when you get back from vacation, you will have your brand new XM facilities.  And here we are.  Sitting in the new studios.  The people on Pal Talk.  They did an amazing job.  The people on Pal Talk obviously can look in and get the first glimpse.  Yeah.  What are they saying so far?  Of the new studio.  They're saying E-Rot's cam is pixelated.  I can't see.  Oh boy.  Is what one of them is saying.  Oh boy.  Saying wow. 
[02:14:00]  Huge.  My XM audio sounds as though it's being played from a recording from an 8-track.  Yeah.  It sounds very bassy.  I don't know.  It's a little bassy.  I don't know why.  Let me see if I can get the cameras are a little different in here.  But there's.  Whoa.  Look at that dude.  Wow.  Wow.  There it is.  You're.  Wow.  Look at the camera just moving by itself.  What are you doing over there?  Isn't that great?  Well it's a state of the art camera equipment now.  Very, very cool.  And we got.  Very cool.  Jimmy.  There it is though.  And yeah. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you.  XM.  Thank you.  And thanks to all the fans that came out for the first walkover.  Oh my God.  It had to be at least 100 people.  I didn't think we were going to get over here in time.  It had to be at least 100 if not more.  Yeah.  So there you go.  All right.  Well.  Yeah.  I hope that was believable.  Yeah.  Dude when you guys come back I'm telling you.  New studio.  It's a guarantee you can bank on it. 
[02:15:00]  What happened?  You can bank on it.  Shut up.  I have.  I knew all along that there'd be delays.  That's it.  Wow.  Wow.  That's it.  It's amazing because they were able to create an exact replica of the K-Rock studio.  Right.  Is what they did.  Right.  Like right down to every little detail.  Yeah.  So we're comfy.  I knew it.  Why don't we get Don Wicklund on the phone.  Find out what the fuck's going on.  Where's our new studio that was guaranteed to us when we got back from break. 
[02:15:30]  They're like it's perfect.  Do you guys go on vacation and come back to a new studio?  Tell Wicklund to drop the toilet brush.  Take the rubber gloves off.  And tell us why we don't have a studio.  Mm-hmm.  I um.  Is Owen Wilson okay?  We didn't talk about that at all.  I forgot about that.  Dude.  The paparazzi have been following me around for a fucking week.  Oh.  They're going.  Oh.  There he is.  Trying to get an exclusive picture of Owen Wilson.  I had to keep saying I'm not Owen Wilson.  There he is.  Stop already. 
[02:16:00]  Look.  My nose ain't effed up.  He's coming out of the apartment quick.  Get him.  I'm not Owen Wilson.  See.  He's crazy.  He doesn't even know he's Owen Wilson.  You ever.  People think I look like Owen Wilson.  I'm like.  I don't really see that one.  No.  I don't see that one.  I'm sorry.  Who thinks that?  Owen Wilson man.  What a bad boy he was.  What a fucking.  And you know what's really funny is the guy he was hanging out with.  He's a guy I've talked about who I think is brilliantly funny.  A guy named Steve Coogan is apparently a very bad boy. 
[02:16:30]  He's a British guy.  According to Courtney Love, Stephen Coogan was the one that gave Owen Wilson the.  The dope.  Oh.  That's what.  The harrowing.  Ah.  The harrowing.  Well.  Steve Coogan did a show which my girlfriend turned me on to from England called The Alan  Partridge Show.  And he is fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  He plays an awful talk show host and it's like there's canned laughter with no audience  but it works. 
[02:17:00]  It's a truly funny fucking show.  Oh now I gotta check that out.  There's a couple of seasons of it.  Yeah.  But the second season or third season where he is just they show his life he's living  in a little trailer and he's doing radio.  Right.  He's just.  I want to hug him.  I'm like God.  I want to see that now.  I guess Kate Hudson blew off Owen Wilson because she realized how bad his drug problem was.  That's what I was reading over the last week and.  Who knew.  And it sounds like he was one of these guys that kind of did his thing.  You know maybe maybe a pill or two here. 
[02:17:30]  Maybe a little drinking.  This is what I'm seeing.  I don't know for sure.  And then all of a sudden he was introduced to the H and man he just.  Wow.  Well heroin is such a great uplifting drug.  You always hear that from people.  He went head first.  Yeah but there are people that are on H and they just you don't even know it.  Really.  A lot of rock stars and stuff and they could still function and then others they just go  head first.  Just lose it.  Blam.  I don't look like the blonde guy from Air Supply Dan. 
[02:18:00]  The blonde guy.  How do you know what the blonde guy from Air Supply looks like?  Did he really try to kill himself or was just some kind of bullshit like thing?  Dude he was really fucked up supposedly on the H and he did a little cutting.  I wonder.  He was a bloody mess and I guess Luke Wilson found him.  A bloody mess.  His brother Luke found him.  You think it's because of Kate Hudson is a cliddling with this Dax guy who's really dishy?  Dude we had Dax on our show.  We couldn't wait for him to leave the studio. 
[02:18:30]  He was a bore.  Oh Dax?  Yeah.  She's going out with Dax?  Yeah.  We couldn't wait to get him out.  He was.  He sucked.  But I mean.  On the show.  That's the guy that she's been.  Wasn't she.  Was she with Chris Robinson while she was fucking Owen Wilson or no?  She.  I don't know.  While they're promoting you, me, and Dupree?  There's some.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe that was the problem.  But supposedly Chris Robinson couldn't keep his.  Oh no.  In his pants.  I don't know.  All in his pants.  Okay.  I think it meant couldn't keep it hard. 
[02:19:00]  No.  There's all sorts of rumors that Chris was doing a little of that cheating.  She went and did her little cheating with Owen Wilson and then found out that Owen was  on the dope and then she moved on to Dax.  Oh boy.  And man, we met Kate Hudson and Chris Robinson back in Boston.  Yeah.  And they were like the perfect couple there.  Were they happy?  If we're speaking about couples, were they implying in the paper that Paul McCartney is  like going out with who the fuck? 
[02:19:30]  Renee Zellweger.  Renee Zellweger?  Renee Zellweger?  Can you tell I go to PerezHilton.com?  Jesus.  Dude, I don't want to start with you.  E-Rock's got something to add.  E-Rock, please.  It was Renee and Christy Brinkley.  Nah.  At the same time?  I didn't hear the Christy Brinkley.  I didn't hear Christy Brinkley.  I just saw Renee Zellweger and Paul McCartney having a second dinner together and like kind  of getting close.  Well, no, Anthony.  It was at Jon Bon Jovi's end of summer bash out there in East Hampton.  Oh, I thought it was P. Diddy's white party. 
[02:20:00]  And Jon Bon Jovi decided to join the house band.  We got to fucking read this shit.  Dude, I read it now.  I'm fucked.  TMZ.com, baby.  I'm there.  And then know what happened?  Bruce Springsteen was at the party and Paul McCartney and Roger Waters.  Wow.  Yeah.  And somebody else.  And they all took turns singing.  They made a little super group on stage.  Wow.  And guess who was in the audience just losing their mind, having a great time? 
[02:20:30]  Um...  Hoo-hoo Howie.  Really?  Was just loving life.  Damn, I missed it.  St. Paul McCartney and Jon Bon Jovi and Roger Waters all in the same band.  Must have been something.  I hope he didn't hoo-hoo too much because then his dentures would have fallen out.  His false teeth would have flown out of his head.  Supposedly, he wears dentures.  That's another thing that's...  Did you see that?  That's in the gossip column.  That was hysterical.  Who the hell is this?  Hello? 
[02:21:00]  Tunt!  Tunt!  Hello?  Tunt!  Hello?  Not getting reception?  No, I get reception.  You just don't get an answer.  Oh.  Because it's a machine calls you.  It's a machine and then they wait to see if someone's talking or if it's another machine  and then it hangs up.  Yeah.  And it's an 888 number so it's one of these goddamn service calls.  I'm so disgusted with people calling me.  All right, throw your phone.  Uh, 888, uh, 5-some-5-something.  Oh, and if PalTalk people know who that is. 
[02:21:30]  Hmm.  Uh, throw your phone.  It doesn't...  I've called it back.  It doesn't...  Throw your phone.  You're not able to call back.  No, I love my iPhone.  By the way, uh, Dave from Mass, he's right.  Entertainment gossip needs to be followed with no homo.  You're right.  Ah.  And I do not look like Ellen DeGeneres, you ass.  No.  My old haircut, maybe.  Dude, I thought...  Maybe the old dude that I was sporting.  Perez Helton looks gay.  Perez Helton?  Tardy rumors, bud.  Did he say Perez Helton or Perez?  Oh, Perez. 
[02:22:00]  He looks a little gay.  Hmm.  There was the rumor that was in the paper.  I did read that.  That, uh, somebody was over at Howie's, uh, house in the Hamptons.  It's always a maid or something.  And, um, they had to go up into the bedroom.  The master bed.  No one...  Oh, it was some kind of...  Like a reporter or something.  I don't even know what the fuck it was.  But they were wandering around the house looking for a bathroom or something.  They end up upstairs in his bedroom and look around and there were choppers in a glass  on, on the night table. 
[02:22:30]  Or next to the sinker in the bathroom.  I don't know.  Yeah, there were choppers in the, like dentures.  There were dentures in a glass of water.  I will say that his voice has sounded...  There was...  I swear to you.  I listen to audio like that when the guys, the shows are going back and forth.  Wait a minute.  Are you...  You're going to admit that you listen to Howard?  Are you crazy?  No, no, no.  Wow.  You're not supposed to ever admit that.  You're a crazed fan.  In all honesty, I've only heard it on...  Fucking troll.  ...when it's been played on this show.  That's true.  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  It sounded a little bit like there was something with the voice. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, it really did.  I didn't know, like, uh, just something.  Yeah, something, something going on?  Yes.  Hmm, interesting.  I don't know.  All right, well...  I'll have to look into that one.  Oh, there was some other gossip that...  There was something going on with a little more Howie gossip with the fake caller.  Did you listen to the audio of that?  Why, why, why?  People, they have, like, the same guy calling in on two different occasions, plugging his  cable TV show.  All it is is him going, dude, it was great, and let me... 
[02:23:30]  And bringing up details of the shows, and Howard's just going, yeah, yeah.  That's great.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, fantastic.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it's a great service.  It was like a commercial that the guy did, a caller, twice, and it was the same guy.  He has fake callers call in and praise his cable show.  Really?  Yeah.  And the cable show is a complete disaster.  And people are saying years ago, he just would have gone, like, shut up.  Or it's kind of calls, like, if we get that people start kissing our ass like that, 
[02:24:00]  Opie goes, what do you like about the show so much?  And then click, because the fucking audience gets bored shitless over having your ass kissed.  Right.  Supposedly it's a disaster, that whole cable venture he went into.  Anyway.  Oh, the other gossip is that...  Gossip.  Howard K. Stern.  Yes.  And Larry...  Burkhead.  Burkhead.  We're sucking each other's cocks.  Larry Burkhead.  What a mess, that whole situation, man.  They got caught, supposedly, sucking each other's cocks. 
[02:24:30]  Sucked that cock.  And know where this is coming out.  The Daily News printed it up in the paper last week or something, and Rita Crosby, or C...  Rita Crosby, right?  Rita Crosby.  From MSNBC.  MSNBC, straight across me.  Hi, I got the news.  To which, you know, I think about...  I guess she finally got that last polyp that shut down her voice, because she got fired  or let go from MSNBC, so she decided to write a book on the whole Anna Nicole Smith thing.  And she's basically claiming, I believe, this is what I read, that those two were sucking 
[02:25:00]  each other's cocks and got caught.  Well, she said...  Sucking them cocks?  I read that there was a video of them blowing each other, and Anna Nicole would watch it.  They said, lay out and watch the video.  Oh, watch the video?  Yeah.  Of them two together.  So apparently, if it's true, that's what I read, that she would watch it.  That's...  Do you love me more than all the cocks in the men's room?  Pilled out for that girl.  Oh.  What a disaster.  Do you love me more than all the stars in the sky? 
[02:25:30]  We're so gossipy.  Oh, boy.  What a gossip show we do.  Oh, boy.  But Rita Crosby, that...  That...  That...  That...  That...  That...  That...  That...  That...  That...  That...  She gets fired, and now she's doing a tell-all book on Anna Nicole Smith.  There you go.  I don't know if she got fired, but she's no longer on MSNBC.  Is she in there?  See.  We have to get audio.  We don't have it yet.  But I would like to get some...  Maybe not today, but talk about Paula Zahn, apparently her wonderful marriage.  She's a naughty girl, it seems. 
[02:26:00]  Could be a naughty girl.  Apparently, one who loves to rip the Opie and Anthony show, should they be fired, apparently  likes...  Apparently.  Apparently.  But isn't she supposed to like...  With her husband.  With her husband.  See, she's a married woman.  Ah.  And there are allegations being made, certain allegations being made, that perhaps she's  in some extramarital affair.  Yeah, apparently, that's what they say, and... 
[02:26:30]  Oh, that's...  Naughty Paula.  That's not good.  That's all right for a shock jock.  Hey, hey, Paula.  Paula's a fair shock.  Where's my Paula Zahn?  Paula Zahn's teed-off hubby didn't know that Steamy didn't...  Wait, all right, wait, wait.  Thank you, Sam.  Wait, wait, let me do this.  Steamy.  Paula Zahn's teed-off hubby didn't know that Steamy's sex trips between his wife and an old  pal were par for the course for years.  Okay, who's the husband?  Because teed-off and par for the course, it's a golf thing. 
[02:27:00]  We got a golfer.  Is he a golfer?  The illicit years...  Oh, real golf.  The illicit years-long love affair between Zahn and business big Paul Freiborg was sizzling  even as Freiborg hit the golf links with Zahn's real estate magnate husband, Richard Cohen.  Mm-hmm.  Richard feels betrayed, one pal said, and he only found out the truth from a tell-all manuscript.  Zahn wrote that documents her relationship.  Hey, you guys speak up.  Oh. 
[02:27:30]  Uh, from a tell-all manuscript, Zahn wrote that documents her relationship with Conti Group  CEO Freiborg.  Oh, so she wrote a manuscript about it.  Oh, you naughty...  Wow, she writes down her little...  So then...  Let me pencil.  Wait.  So then, I took his balls into my mouth and sucked on them.  He treated my asshole like a punching bag. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, it's a lurid and shocking handwritten account of their relationship, said a friend  who asked not to be identified.  I remember making a noise like this.  As my lover made this noise.  Motherfucker!  He treated my eye sockets like two separate wombs and became buckets full of them while 
[02:28:30]  I rapidly blinked out the seed and judged Opie and Anthony on my Cornwall CNN show that  nobody watches.  Cunt?  Did I call...  Cunt, you are.  Cunt.  Did I really call Zahn's husband a real estate magnet?  That's fine.  A magnet.  No, it is.  He's a cunt magnet because he attracted her.  Whoops.  Whoopsie.  Fucking rotten bitch.  Sources declined to discuss any details of Zahn's love book or where exactly he was found 
[02:29:00]  except to say she was indiscreet.  Ooh.  The former CNN anchor's affair with Frye became public knowledge in April when it was  announced that Zahn and Cohen were parting ways after 20 years.  Oh, so she was apparently or allegedly fucking this guy while she was...  I didn't know if it was before the marriage.  That's what they're saying, Jimmy.  That's what they're saying.  Oh, wow.  Dirty...  And she wrote it down.  What a...  Oh.  Maybe you shouldn't worry so much about Opie and Anthony being fired.  And you should keep your marriage legs closed.  Cunt.  Dirty cunt.  Oh, she really, really tried to lead the way to get us fired again. 
[02:29:30]  Yes, she did because apparently...  She had her people hanging outside this very studio every single day with those stupid  cameras.  Well, he told Friends her affair just took his heart out, the pal said.  Friends said Cohen had believed the relationship was a recent development, but Zahn's book shows  their relationship was much more long-term than Cohen had ever suspected.  Oh, I can't wait till this gets out.  This had been going on at least a couple of years, another friend said.  It clearly spells out the relationship. 
[02:30:00]  There's no mystery.  It had plenty of detail.  Look at this next line, yeah.  The friend described the book as something like a high school girl would write.  It's childlike and devastating.  Wow.  So she was all frothed up, all lathered up over this guy.  Wow.  Wasn't her husband, too, the guy who lived in the building with that rare bird, the fucking  hawk that Eric went to see?  Yeah, hawk went for hawk.  It was hawk for hawk. 
[02:30:30]  It was something we did.  Wasn't that the fucking...  Some stupid named thing.  Wasn't that the building that had the rare bird?  Yeah, yeah.  Her husband was like the...  What do they call the groups that...  Conservationists?  No, no, no, no, no.  What?  Cunt?  No.  Oh, no, no, no.  She's a cunt.  Cunt?  He's a cunt's magnet?  He attracts cunt's?  He's the head of the board.  Co-op board.  Oh, okay.  Co-op board.  And at the time the pair hooked up, Colin and Freiburg were playing golf together. 
[02:31:00]  Blooberies.  Their families spent time with each other.  So apparently their family...  While eating blueberries together.  Eating blueberries.  Bloobery.  So they're friends.  The husband's playing golf.  And apparently, judgmental piglet wife is doing dirty things with Mr. Freiburg.  And writing them down and jotting them down.  Jotting down what?  Today.  Jotting down what?  The illicit details.  With who?  With...  Between Paul...  Oh, between... 
[02:31:30]  Between cunt and Freiburg.  Freiburg.  Today's the day.  I'm gonna give up my ass.  Mr. Freiburg.  I will marry you.  Hey!  Hey!  Paula!  Paula!  I wanna fuck your ass!  I love Mr. Freiburg.  He's so dreamy.  Oh!  Oh!  School to be...  He treats my cunt like a navy vessel and deposits semen in it. 
[02:32:00]  She puts a smiley face.  It's cnn.com.  She said it's childlike, so...  Yeah, exactly.  She put little hearts over the eyes.  Today, he pissed in my...  In my...  In my...  What else has an eye?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  He put his...  He put his dick between my tits.  And the dick and the tits have little hearts over the eyes in a schoolgirl fashion.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue. 
[02:32:30]  He took a shit on my chest.  It was like stew.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  I'm a cunt.  How about you?  Dirty, dirty Paula.  I love it.  Freiburg, a father of four.  Freiburg.  Freiburg.  A father of four is now getting divorced from his stunning wife, Josebeth.  Josebeth?  Apparently, he met her in a Bible.  Josebeth.  Josebeth! 
[02:33:00]  Zahn, 51, and Cohn haven't yet filed for divorce papers.  And Cohn's friend said they were trying to work out an amicable agreement until Friday  when Zahn socked him with a lawsuit demanding he account for the whereabouts of her estimated  $25 million in earnings.  Apparently, she was too busy to look after them because she was sucking the dirty CEO ball  bag of Mr. Freiburg.  Apparently, she was too busy to look after her earnings because she was attacking the Opie 
[02:33:30]  in Anthony's show and licking the withered asshole of Mr. Freiburg and jotting it down in a tell-all  book, which I don't know how her husband found it.  Maybe she had it in a file in her folder on her computer called Cunton Freiburg.  And he looked.  The suit accuses Cohen, who's acted as Zahn's financial manager since 1986, of putting much 
[02:34:00]  of her money into highly liquid limited liability companies.  Apparently, the only liquid she liked was a salty beverage fired from the cock and balls  of the said Mr. Freiburg, fired between her tits, dot that eye with a little heart and  child-like fashion, into her cunt-slash-mouth.  Both are the same thing. 
[02:34:30]  Should the Opie and Anthony show be fired?  I don't know, but neither one of them cheats do they, cunt.  Dirty little cunt.  We've been waiting to have some dirt on this bitch.  Oh, you filthy.  She spent day after day trying to get us fired when no one else gave a shit about that  story that happened to us.  Couldn't stop bringing other women and empowering other women on.  And apparently, allegedly, naughty little piglet was doing things with a sea.  But who was she naughty with?  I don't remember. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, Phil Freiburg.  Paula Zahn, her niece for Freiburg.  If I may borrow a bit.  It also charged that some of her earnings had been diverted to Mr. Collins' individual  account for his own use and benefit.  Maybe he was paying for therapy because his wife was acting as a cum receptacle for the  said CEO.  We're trading assets. 
[02:35:30]  That's right.  He was making a few deposits himself, wasn't he?  Paula Zahn was super bad.  Paula Zahn, away to the boss court, g-g-g-g-g.  Because she was super bad.  Mr. Freiburg, apparently while they were playing golf, he was using her cunt as a hole to deposit  his ball in.  The naughty, naughty Paula Zahn wrote it all down in childlike schoolgirl fashion, even 
[02:36:00]  though she's 51, and her cunt looks like something old.  Looks like there was some balls of fury.  A source close to Cohen and Zahn was actually the one using smoke and mirrors.  I'm sorry.  A source close to Cohen said Zahn was actually the one using smoke and mirrors in a bid to  try to weasel out of their prenuptial agreement.  Ah.  She wants one way or another to break the agreement and to go after his entire net worth, the source 
[02:36:30]  said, of the out-of-work TV personality.  Is she off the air?  I don't know.  She's done.  Oh, good.  Apparently the almost 52-year-old gunt trying to get radio jocks fired should have been busy.  She was displaying appalling behavior.  G-g-g-g.  Maybe, uh, hey, Paula, that HD, uh, TV's a bitch, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Paula's on the chopping block since HD can't hide her wrinkles. 
[02:37:00]  Uh, almost done here.  Richard would like to end this in keeping with total regard for the prenup, which will still  leave her a very wealthy woman with tens of millions of dollars.  The source also angrily denied a report that Cohen refused to come to terms.  All right, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's nonsense.  It's called, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, she's a cunt, a seed, a drog, draining his  large ball bag into my mouth and gargling with it before kissing my husband. 
[02:37:30]  Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Zahn's lawyers.  Wait a minute.  I don't think that was part of the story.  God, I think you want to worry.  I'm on to ya.  I apologize.  I don't want to bore the listeners.  I'm just trying to zip through the details.  Zahn's lawyers, blah, blah, blah, blah, 52-year-old twat looks 60, blah, blah, blah,  obsessed over radio shows, should have been keeping her legs closed in the marriage bed.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, bah, Con, 51, plus I, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  sea in hair, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, brah.  Hair stood up like a porcupine husband's chair.  What is that?  It smells like my buddy. 
[02:38:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, while they're turning  off.  I shouldn't have written it down in heart's little I.  L-O-L, like schoolgirl, blah, blah, blah, blah, con, con, fire.  See, I can't die.  Dying fire.  I can't do the voice, but Bill from Waterford.  Paul Azan went to suck on a Halloweenie.  Halloweenie.  Halloweenie.  I love that.  A little bit.  Oh, Ron Fess.  That was great.  What does Goldblum say about it? 
[02:38:30]  Goldblum?  What am I missing here?  Why are so many Jews involved?  Wait, let's say hi to Nick McHenry.  I don't get this.  Nick, what's up?  Yeah, good night.  Guys, I was just wondering, what does our good friend Jeff Goldblum have to say while  Paul Azan?  Oh, wow.  See, we're a little slow.  We're just getting back into the story of a thing.  I'm not sure.  And a rock scream.  Rock scream to boot.  Nice.  Yes, let's go to Jeff Goldblum. 
[02:39:00]  Goddamn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunt.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Well, I don't mean to say I'm cunt.  Can I just say that I...  Paul Azan didn't want her husband to find out that Mr. Redneck had her knocked off.  According to her manuscript, she wrote,  Mr. Fryerborg chains me down like a stuck pig and uses my mouth like a pocket puss. 
[02:39:30]  Her husband wasn't happy to read this.  I'm so happy.  I know.  Isn't that great?  Speaking of cunt...  Oh.  I'm so happy.  Samantha from Sex and the City.  Come on.  Speaking of cunt...  Speaking of cunt to my asshole.  Jesus.  Why don't you leave a little to the imagination there, Samantha?  Oh, boy.  Imagination.  I just want to imagine a big cunt of my ass. 
[02:40:00]  There you go.  Oh, Samantha.  Right.  You're so wild.  You're the wild old bag of the show, aren't you?  Aren't you?  You fucking unlubed old sack.  Speaking of cunt.  Yeah.  So we're all out here to lunch just sipping on our little coffee at some hip, trendy restaurant  here in Manhattan.  And sharing secrets.  Sharing little secrets.  So what did you do last night?  I must have sucked 20 cogs. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, Samantha.  Oh, you're the wild one, aren't you?  You're crazy.  Well, I pushed the elevator button last night to go up to my room.  What happened?  20 guys fucked me.  Wow.  Wow.  You're just...  You just get fucked at every turn.  You're just edgy, aren't you?  Speaking of turning, I'll turn around and let him fuck me.  Oh.  Boy.  Wow.  You really shocked us with that little secret, Samantha.  Shocking.  Boy.  Is that the word? 
[02:41:00]  I can't sit through one advertisement of that fucking show.  TBS has sex in the city.  Do they?  Do they.  Oh.  They go around the table.  There's some cute little secrets.  Yeah.  Samantha.  Jesus.  Samantha.  I love ass sex.  Oh, why so much ass sex?  Well, my fucking uterus fell out 10 years ago.  So all, the only hole I have left that even resembles a pussy is my asshole. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, Samantha, you're wild.  And I would stretch that out last night with that black guy.  I met at yoga class.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah.  Speaking of yoga.  Speaking of yoga.  I can now bend in a new position where I could suck a dick and fuck in the ass and the pussy  at the same time.  Thanks to yoga, if there's no cocks around, I could eat myself out. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, Samantha.  Oh, you're just a wild one.  Oh, you're wild.  Would you like some more tea?  Oh, tea?  How about teabag my face?  Oh, Samantha.  Yuck.  I was watching that show.  Awful me writes, opiate impressions as John Ritter is to breathing.  Thank you.  Oh.  Oh, that's not nice.  First day back from vacation.  Yeah, give us a break.  You break my asshole. 
[02:42:30]  God damn my brother.  God bless Elmo for coming up with that application back in the day.  Love that one.  Because usually when you say speaking of or something, you're kind of going to make it  subtle, but she, it was always something over the top.  I got to go shopping too.  Speaking of shopping.  Let me tell you what happened in the dressing room.  I had three cocks in my ass.  I stuck the mannequin head in my pussy. 
[02:43:00]  We get it.  You're saucy.  You're a saucy old broad, aren't you?  Salt of the earth, aren't you?  That's it.  Not shy in the least, are you?  You're a cougar.  Oh, the guys are all still hefty, aren't they?  Yeah, sure they are.  Dude, how funny is cougars now, man?  See, before someone came up with the whole cougar thing.  Cougar.  There were women out there a bit on the older side. 
[02:43:30]  They dollied themselves up, painted up their faces, and they were looking for young cock  in the bars.  I was in a restaurant the other night, and I saw nothing but cougars at the bars were  walking through.  I was laughing my ass off.  Because now it's like, they have to know they're cougars, and everyone's looking at  them laughing.  They have cougar nights at bars.  Cougar night.  Where it's like, here come a bunch of old broads.  Come on, young guys.  You just want to get your dick wet?  Easy pickings.  By the way, I feel much better.  Awful me. 
[02:44:00]  He wrote back.  Thank you, Awful me.  He writes, I put the winky eye.  Okay, thank you.  Speaking of winky eye.  Oh, these are the fake Howard TV callers.  Are they good?  Well, he's obviously a guy plugging.  Can I tell you another trend in radio that is very disturbing?  And we haven't done it, and we will not do it.  And maybe some people could help us out with this bit.  Where there's a service where you could get people to call your radio show to kind of 
[02:44:30]  like get the phones going and talk about really, really outrageous shit.  Yeah.  Yep.  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't have a really good example.  Maybe someone out there does, but it's something like just over the top.  Oh, of a...  And you can't prove if it's real or fake, and then it gets other people calling.  It's dirty, dirty.  One guy really used to do this a lot.  Still does, right?  I don't know.  Douchebag.  What's up with that little thing? 
[02:45:00]  Do you know?  What's that?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Okay.  Eric, you're on the air.  Howard, I wanted to take a second and tell you an experience about Howard TV.  The experience is amazing.  The great thing about Howard TV is that...  Listen to this.  Holy shit, it's a commercial!  It's a fucking read.  Is this...  Wait, all right, but...  No, he took it as a call.  This isn't taking...  This isn't like...  This is like if you listen to the other side of the program when we do live reads.  This is a live read.  Let me tell you about such and such. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  And you try to make it sound natural.  By just going like he's on the air.  Right.  The other night I wasn't feeling well.  Usually I turn it on to go to sleep.  And I come into the menu.  I go into the menu.  And you have more opportunities to watch shows there than the whole cable television network itself.  So I go through the menu.  And I see...  I got a choice.  I can watch the Scott Bale interview. 
[02:46:00]  Now he's just sitting here listening to this and going...  Right, right.  This goes on.  He's letting him babble about this because it's a fake caller.  They're in cahoots together.  It's some guy, yeah, that's calling up in cahoots.  It's a commercial for his pay service.  This is O.P. Anthony, Jim Norton, Hilton.com.  Yes, we're exposing.  We're exposing everybody now.  ...interview.  Right.  Or I could watch the world's strongest naked woman. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  That's a great episode.  You know...  So I'm sitting here and I'm coming down with the flu and I don't feel well.  And I'm thinking, should I jerk?  By the way, listen closely to the voice.  Yeah.  Because then we just happened to have another guy that called in about this.  Yeah.  That sounds a lot like the guy you're listening to.  The same thing.  And it's the same name.  Yeah.  Can I...  Didn't even change names.  ...dark off before I go to sleep?  In that case, I would watch the world's strongest naked women.  Absolutely.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  And I say, you know, I'm going to go for Scott Baio.  Okay.  You know, so I start to watch the Scott Baio interview because it was amazing.  You're a genius.  Click.  And, uh...  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm about 10 minutes into it.  I said, I'm going to go jerk off and go to sleep.  I get off of the Scott Baio interview.  I go to the world's strongest naked women.  Oh, my God.  Who cares?  I get the business out of the way.  I wake up the next morning and I go right back to where I left off of Scott Baio. 
[02:47:30]  That's what on-demand programming means?  Oh, listen to his teeth.  What is that?  Listen to the teeth.  Dude, there's something fucking going on there.  Listen, listen, listen.  He probably didn't brush his teeth for 20 years.  Ah, then there's a problem.  Listen, listen to the teeth.  I go right back to where I left off of Scott Baio.  That's what on-demand programming means?  You hear that?  That's what on-demand programming means.  Wait, I got to hear that again.  Back to where I left off of Scott Baio.  That's what on-demand programming means.  Oh, he's getting used to something. 
[02:48:00]  The plate clicked.  That's what on-demand programming means.  So, let me get this straight.  The guy jerked off to Scott Baio.  Wait, that's all I got from that.  What the fuck is that?  God, they're going to have to reset their fucking clock on the message board.  That's worth it, though.  That's what on-demand programming means.  The boobie.  That's what it means, boobie.  Early bird special. 
[02:48:30]  Plenty of food.  Good food.  Plenty of it.  Oh, my goodness.  Who did you finish on?  Which girl?  Which girl?  The one with the big meat curtains.  Yes.  Beautiful, right?  Yes.

Oh, wow.  Wow.  Welcome to the Howard revolution.  He can't even say revolution anymore. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  What's next?  Big Swifty Lazar glasses?  Swifty Lazar.  Those ones that De Niro's wearing at the end of Casino.  Those big black ones.  Wow.  Dave from Mass, is this Howard Voss?  Actually, that's coming in a lot, but I read the first one.  I'm sorry.  It sounds differently than the, honestly, God. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, my God.  I haven't heard his ears.  I know.  The thing is, oh, we listen to him.  Is that, is that, is that.  But the reality is, I haven't listened to him in a long time.

[03:01:00]  oh boy well he's desperate because he's desperate because he's getting people uh to call in and do  like pretty much what amounts to a commercial is he losing more subscribers or teeth uh could you  i don't know i can't speak to that only the numbers only the numbers yeah all right all right  going back to electriceelman.com howard stern guest book by electriceelman.com  the breast test this is a bit i guess howard did back in uh january of 2005 
[03:01:30]  howard took a call from a woman named janice whose husband left her after she got a breast reduction  she said she used to have huge breasts 40 g's but she started to feel that her husband only loved her  for her boobs she said he loved to look at and play with them and she wanted to test him to see if he  really loved her without consulting him she decided to get her breast reduced all the way down to an a cup  she told her husband the day before operation and he freaked out and left her janice is upset because  she feels this proves her point howard said he would have left her too for the following reasons 
[03:02:00]  no guy wants to be tested if she needed to get her breast reduced for a medical reason or it was just  something she wanted to do she should have discussed it with him first instead she got the operation out  of spite she took away something her husband loved and derived pleasure from how could you blame him for  being pissed off that's what howard said janice kept trying to defend herself saying that her boobs are just  going to end up sagging anyway so she wanted to prevent it and besides her new boobs looked nice  but howard said that didn't matter all that mattered was that she had her breasts reduced just to piss off 
[03:02:30]  her husband and it worked marty told janice that he saw a girl once at frank's chicken house in new  jersey named busty heart and she had size triple m breasts and seemed perfectly happy so basically this  is a uh this is a false phone call yeah a phone set up by electricealman.com just to create the  uh to get discussion going right so when if somebody calls and has a subject then you could  all go off on the subject but you know that the call that's coming in is is fake it's a made-up call  it's written yeah and you pay money for the service according to steve this guy's been trying to get

[03:04:30]  of a fake caller uh a listener named angela called in to say she felt all priests should be castrated  before they joined the priesthood in order to solve the molestation problems facing the catholic church  that's outrageous while fred and robin noted they didn't agree with angela artie commented  he thought if priests were allowed to have sex not only would they not touch children but more men  would want to become priests in the first place giving fodder to artie god bless him yeah that's about 
[03:05:00]  it well there you go yeah congrats how did we get into that tangent oh the uh fake call huh i was  wondering how we got there and it was the fake call from uh the guy yeah pimping out uh the cable  show yeah whoo whoo whoo robin where's my paladine something's going on there something  is going on there man they're not brave enough to admit it so they're like saying a housekeeper 
[03:05:30]  or somebody may have may have found somebody someone's not brave enough to print what they  they know as as in my opinion as fact what i read was somebody went upstairs did you find that  and saw the uh false teeth in a glass can you find that real fast it's pretty funny actually  wow yeah that is rough uh wow uh 
[03:06:00]  what aren't you able to like get some teeth drilled into your head or something not if you got some  bone uh oh is that the problem dude clean your teeth oh the shit that could happen to him man  yeah you wish you don't want you wish it was just that you could get some new teeth because they  look good the new teeths yeah and you could get them like stuck up into that jaw you wish that's all  that's all they're gonna do you got a fucked up grill yeah yeah yo there's something wrong with 
[03:06:30]  your choppers yes oh there oh thank you travis we've been waiting for howard stern wears dentures  question mark it's missed i got mystery molars how about i get mystery molars all right well  say mystery molars because that one's better obviously mystery stupid orbit cast makes it  boring bah all this murder talk is so boring and complex let's instead turn our focus to something 
[03:07:00]  far more important howard stern's teeth or according to the new york post the lack there  of a discovery was made by a crew member on a photo shoot for hampton's magazine that accidentally  got lost yeah right and uh and i i all right i guess this crew member was uh doing a photo shoot  he accidentally got lost and then they write parentheses yeah right and ended up in the master  bedroom bathroom i know that when i get lost in someone's house the first place i'll head for is the  master bath because it will undoubtedly lead me to safety what in the midst of my confusion i tend

[03:29:00]  just knowing that a guy does that there's a cleverness to what he's putting on a play by himself  yeah yeah that's brilliant there's a difference between that and fucking people know that too he's  not trying to pull the wool over the joke oh good point sam in the outer banks uh arrest uh  the arrest has to be made on thursday that's when the arbitron weekly diaries end yeah that's a  good point uh there i just read that i don't even know if that's true to be completely honest with  you uh let's say hi to shane in kansas shane what's up hey i want to cancel my subscription to xm uh me

I wanna hear Jimmy's, yes.  I gotta say, I was gonna tease it, but it just makes me sad.  I know.  You know what?  Listening back, it is.  Watch me spin this, though.  All right, go ahead, try.  This proves to those fuckers out there that have to be on the message board. 
[03:40:30]  Dude, dude, I used to listen in Boston, but they suckers suck now.  I'm gonna start finding bits to prove that this show is way better than it used to be.  And we used to play that fucking, probably three times a show.  You really, honestly, you play that a lot?  Oh my God.  Dude, it was requested like crazy.  Dude, and that thing, other radio shows across the country played it like crazy. 
[03:41:00]  All over.  It ended up on the internet under Adam Sandler's song.  And it's just...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you want?  Nothing.  See, don't dance to it.  Don't dance to it.  The Macarena was a giant song when we did that.  I remember I was doing stand-up.  It was giant.  I was doing stand-up when it was out.  I remember hearing a lot of awful comedians talk about it.  Right.  If we still play...  What are you doing?  I'm requesting it.  Why are you playing it again? 
[03:41:30]  John in New York, he writes, I wish it was longer.  Oh, there you go.  Hey, Masturbator.  See, it's Hey, Masturbator instead of Macarena.  You want to smack the monkey?  I can give you good advice.  Hey, Masturbator.  Go, Jim.  Sounds like he's doing it.  He's jerking off.  He's doing all that jerking.  See? 
[03:42:00]  He's going to come on it.  Hey, Masturbator.  Hey, Randy from Manchester.  Masturbator was the shit back in the day.  Best thing on the WAAF Unusual Suspect CD.  There you go.  See?  I found that recently.  Yeah.  Dude, we should track through that.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Someone remind me to bring in the Unusual Suspect CD.  Oh, what?  You got it?  That was what Dave does.  Wow.  Let me see.  I don't know what the sheep are in there for.  You know what, though?  Dude, we want to go late today, but then they're going to cut shit off for the fucking 
[03:42:30]  replay.  So now we're going to have to wait for this tomorrow.  Fuck them in there.  Fuck holes.  Hey, Masturbator.  See, now it's a bunch of terms.  Do you guys mind?  I'm trying to enjoy.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Hey, Masturbator.  I'm trying.  Oh, I think that's a...  Hey, Masturbator.  Oh, yeah.  Give it to me.  Yeah, I think the sheep was just...  I don't know why it was turning it.  Dude, I got to play one thing for you.  Oh, no.  Get this shit off. 
[03:43:00]  This is so inside, but don't worry.  We'll make it...  Is it Rocko?  Yes.  I know you're going to do this.  Explain Unusual Suspects for people out there.  Okay, we put out a CD.  Well, no.  Me and Ope first.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We wanted to put our fucking CD out, and all of a sudden, Dave Dickfuck didn't really  understand what we were about and what we were doing.  The genius that was him, Masturbator.  I don't think you guys could actually pull off putting out a CD, so we're going to make 
[03:43:30]  a station CD.  Right.  That's what it was.  So it was acoustic performances from bands that came through the radio station, and then  it was comedy bits from all the shows that were on AAF, and all these guys are either,  well, one show's still rotting at the same fucking place, rotting, and our careers speak  for themselves at this point.  Rocko's selling used cars somewhere.  I'm out in Worcester selling cars, dude.  Ozone, who was a great guy, I believe, has retired from the business, but a very talented 
[03:44:00]  guy.  I'll never say anything bad about him.  And who was the other one?  Who was the other far?  I think that was it.  We were.  That was it, I guess, right?  Yeah.  So this is Rocko's bit.  Well, now, we had a hand in bits, right?  We have one, two, three, four bits on this CD.  Oh, look at us.  Rocko had won. 
[03:44:30]  That's all I could find, dude.  He had it in a lot of shit, but they even, back in the day, were like, oh, fuck, we got  to represent, he's got to represent somehow.  Rock hole.  So they put this Rock hole bit on it.  Rock hole.  Which one is this?  Oh, Rocko was the worst.  Remember, I wish we could find the Chinese restaurant one, but it's not that.  It's, remember this, Ant?  Letter to Miguel.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:45:00]  Hey.  Letter to Miguel.  Rocko.  Rocko used to, like, do so much shit to his calls where you'd hear the same response.  You're like, hey, Wang, you know, why don't you deliver the fucking food when I want it?  And the guy would go, yes?  Yeah, you're an idiot.  Yes?  You'd hear, like, the same tone of yes.  He'd take three words that he got from a phone call and make a half-hour call out of it. 
[03:45:30]  We put Donna Summers, that famous clip.  Donna Summers.  That phone call on this CD.  Tina, the Tina phone call.  Yeah.  Our Tourette's phone call.  Yes.  That was huge on our Dementor World CD, which we ended up putting out after the CD.  A mere couple months.  Thanks, Dave.  But we still sold, like, well over 100,000 copies in the Boston area.  Eight-hour CD signings.  It was ridiculous.  Yeah, dummy.  Proving Dave Dickless wrong. 
[03:46:00]  And most of the tracks on that Dementor World CD, he's still proud of a mere 10 years later.  Right.  All right.  Here's a letter to Miguel.  Rocko.  From Unusual Suspects.  My name is Rocko.  And over the weekend, I was watching television, and I'm watching the commercial for sponsoring a kid.  So I called up, and I told him, I want to sponsor a child. 
[03:46:30]  And I'm writing him a letter, but here's what I got so far.  Dear Miguel, how are the things in your village?  Is the drought over yet?  I'm just sitting here playing Nintendo.  It's about 95 degrees outside, and I have the AC on cube, so I stay nice and cool.  My mom is such an asshole, she made me clean the pool.  We had this huge party at the house with tons of people, and there was so much food,  we had to put it in our second refrigerator downstairs. 
[03:47:00]  And it just sat there for two weeks and spoiled.  We had to throw it all away.  What is it?  When you go outside, do you still have to pee outside?  Or do they have toilets yet?  How's the insect problem?  I heard it's pretty rough over there.  I'm going to send you a can of off.  When it rains outside, does your mom make you guys mudslides?  Right back soon.  Rocko.  How's that?  I can feel the caring. 
[03:47:30]  I do care, damn it!  Not only does Rocko suck, he's a dick.  No, no, no.  Dude...  Good lord.  That...  And I mean this, that could not have been intended to be funny.  No.  No, that was devoid of comedy.  It was a comedy vacuum. 
[03:48:00]  Someone is reminding that there is another track in this.  Like, I can't really see it because it's been like...  Yeah, very long.  Oh, it's...  It's been copied, so it's hard to read.  But I swear to God, this is on here.  Someone remind me and I looked again.  Rocko's surprise date!  Oh, no.  Can we please hear it?  I love...  I love listening to old Rocko stuff.  Hey, what's up, dude?  What a tool.  This guy was a treat and a half. 
[03:48:30]  This guy would order a buffet for the restaurant across the street.  Remember what he did to your TV back in the day?  Oh, my God.  What a douchebag.  See, even back in the day, we were trying to bring TVs into a radio station so we could  play off what, you know, maybe is going on on TV.  You know what I mean?  Like news and just fuck around with just doing like a little mystery science theater crap.  Yeah, yeah.  So I got a little, one of these little portable TVs, you know, a little nine-inch portable  and we'd plug it in and watch TV as we did the show.  And really, you know, it's commonplace now, but really no one was doing this. 
[03:49:00]  We were watching TV on a comedy show and commenting on it.  So Rocko used to call the place across the way, the Marriott or something, go, could you  send over some steaks and some fucking pasta and salads and all kinds of shit.  He would fucking have his show catered.  Safe to say he weighed well over 300, 350 maybe.  That was a big fat fuck.  Probably close to 400.  So they must have been fucking around using my TV.  So they placed the TV on what was, that night, a big bucket pile of ice. 
[03:49:30]  To keep some of the food.  To keep the food cold.  And they put my TV on top of the ice.  And the next day, it was in a bucket of water.  My TV was in a bucket of water because ice does melt.  Were you mad?  Yeah, I was really pissed.  I picked up my TV and water just poured out of everywhere. 
[03:50:00]  And it didn't work.  And I wasn't making a lot of money.  So it wasn't like I could just, you know, go out and get another TV.  I was very angry.  By the way, now that I moved into my new joint, I found the Real Rock TV videos.  Oh, did you?  There's a few online on YouTube.  Anyone have a VHS recorder still?  What?  One of those.  Do you really?  You might want to bring it into the office if someone has it so I can start.  I'll bring some in tomorrow.  Yeah.  You will laugh your ass off.  I saw some on YouTube. 
[03:50:30]  They got a couple of us on YouTube.  Only one or two.  I got a few pretty good ones.  I got every episode.  Yeah, that we got to see.  I got every fucking episode.  Spud's Buckley?  Oh, no.  I don't know who that is, Jimmy.  Dude, let's hear Rocco's date.  All right.  Surprise date.  Surprise date.  Hey, Wad, get back in the kitchen.  Fucking Rocco.  That's a really good side story.  Just one of the many problems people have.  You got a problem, dude?  Talk to me. 
[03:51:00]  Horrible fucking story.  Talk to me.  Making out with some chick.  Nice.  No, I thought it was good.  Everything was good and dandy.  I swear to God, I have no idea.  Yeah.  I guarantee somewhere in this phone call, you're going to hear, dude.  Someone's commenting, hey, Ant, what about the Rocco gym?  Hey, baby, come on up here and show me your Bert and Ernie's.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Would he say that? 
[03:51:30]  Oh, time and time again.  He should have called the guy up and said, hey, get up here and show me your Jim Henson.  He also gave away a Toyota.  Yeah.  It's a toy Yoda.  Dude, I don't care what the bosses say.  I'm giving away a Toyota.  Wow, Rocco, that's outrageous.  You could get fired for that.  I don't care.  I'm a rebel. 
[03:52:00]  I'm giving away a Toyota tonight.  Lock the door.  Lock the doors.  It's a boss call.  Tell him I'm not here.  I'm going to give away a Toyota.  Yeah.  Which was a takeoff on our 100 grand bit, which was pretty classic for the time.  How do you try to improve on 100 grand by giving away a toy Yoda?  Toy Yoda.  Here it is, dude.  You want a toy Yoda? 
[03:52:30]  Get it?  It's a Yoda.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right, here we go.  The surprise date.  I guarantee there's a dude somewhere in here.  Dude.  Just one of the many problems people have.  You got a problem, dude?  Talk to me.  Horrible f***ing story.  Talk to me.  Make it out with some chick.  Nice.  No, I thought it was good.  Everything was good and dandy blonde hair.  Beautiful.  Everything's flowing.  Everything was flowing very well, I might add. 
[03:53:00]  What happened?  Did she have a penis?  She had a f***ing huge penis, man.  Dude.  Dude.  Ha, ha, ha.  And I swear to God, I did not hear it.  I haven't heard this in f***ing.  Even when we got the CD, I never played the other guy's tracks.  Dude.  I knew how awful they were.  It was always dude.  Everything was dude with him.  Dude.  Awful.  What an awful way to wreck the joke.  Yeah.  Let it f***ing sit there for a while.  He should have said something like, what, did she have a little facial hair?  No.  Yeah.  And a penis. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, just.  Why would you say it?  He said it.  He said it, you dummy.  A bit anxious, huh?  He was a bit anxious on that one.  Very well, I might add.  What happened?  Did she have a penis?  She had a f***ing huge penis, man.  Dude.  It wasn't a good thing.  Get out of here.  Let me tell you something.  It was not a good thing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Dude, you were holding a penis in your head.  I would have kicked somebody's ass.  Kicked some ass?  I fell over.  I almost died. 
[03:54:00]  Did you puke?  Did I puke?  I was puking today for crying out loud.  I kissed a f***ing homo.  You kissed him?  Yeah.  We were making out and everything.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You were making out with a guy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And you probably liked it, you little freak.  What do I do, man?  It's not funny, man.  Dude, you stuck your tongue down a dude's throat.  Dude.  Dude.  You stuck your tongue down a dude's throat, dude.  Dude, you dude it, dude, dude, dude, dude. 
[03:54:30]  Dude.  Fucking rock hole, man.  Ha, ha, ha.  You were making out with a guy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And you probably liked it, you little freak.  What do I do, man?  It's not funny, man.  Dude, you stuck your tongue down a dude's throat.  Dude, no, man.  Wait.  And you liked it.  At first, yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It ends?  What?  Okay, terrific.  Did it just end like that? 
[03:55:00]  I guess.  And dude.  He's terrible.  Fucking Rocco.  Dude, but I mean, he's like, he's fucking terrible.  So awful.  I've never heard anybody that funny.  It's, yeah.  Oh.  And we had to share a CD with these.  Oh, the memories.  That's great.  Good times.  Good times, man.  Good times.  Good times.  Yeah.  He used to come on after us when we were doing the afternoons.  And he would just be yelling about getting food. 
[03:55:30]  It was like, there was nothing about, yeah, he did like 7 o'clock, 7 p.m.  So, we'd get done.  And there was nothing about what he was doing or, he would just be like, hey, get some,  hey, cow head.  Get some fucking buffet.  Who was this other intern?  He just used to yell at these guys.  I don't know.  Where the fuck are the condiments? 
[03:56:00]  I need ketchup with this burger.  Half the time, he wasn't even there for half his show.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Remember that?  He's too busy doing his other job.  Dude, just hit, just, I'm going to stand with music.  Just play this call.  Like, he'd take a call.  He would do an hour and let the interns, like, fucking run the board.  Yeah.  And then leave.  He would tape his breaks.  He'd tape his breaks.  Go, all right, dude, after Godsmack, play this. 
[03:56:30]  And then go into this.  I'm gone, dude.  And then play me after this, dude.  Make sure you play it exactly at 1110, because I say 1110 during this, dude.  Yeah, don't fuck me or you're fucked.  Dude.  He's awful.  Yeah.  He was god awful.  And Dave Douglas treated us all like equals.  We were so frustrated.  Look for Rocco on XM202. 
[03:57:00]  XM202.  And this is on the CD, too, for all you Goo Goo Doll fans.  Hey, we have a line of the day?  Sure do.  I hope it's Rocco.  Dude, you put your tongue down another dude's throat, dude.  I forgot all about that dude crap until today.  Dude.  All right, we'll play this instead of some dumb commercial about a discount or whatever.  Let's tell him about the discount, Harry.  All right, we'll play this. 
[03:57:30]  I don't even know what the product's for.  I just hate that commercial.  What is this?  Hope, if you want, I'll go through the archives to find the show where you read about Rocco getting  fired from AAF.  What's that about?  He spent pretty much the whole show reading this article from Boston just celebrating  that he was fired.  Oh, right.  And then we were gone like a few months later.  The best part, we had moles at AAF, and we announced Dave Douglas' firing before he  got fired.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  We knew.  We knew it was going down, and we announced it on the radio while we were on in Boston, 
[03:58:00]  and Dave Douglas thought it was just us fucking around with him, and actually, he had to  take the long walk down the hall and get fired.  Can I make a point, Iraq, that you just put the wrong date up there?  Yeah, I know.  Because they couldn't have been reading something in September of 2002.  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks.  Unless Hope and I were reading it to each other on the phone, and I was reading it to...  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks for reminding us.  Yeah.  Ozone.  Eventually moved to Miami Beach, where he owns and operates a restaurant, scrap bar, and 
[03:58:30]  smokehouse.  Is that the name of the place?  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  We've been trying to hunt him down for a while.  Yeah, Ozone's great.  Ozone midget sighting.  That's from John Osterlin.  Ozone.  Ozone.  All right, listen to this while we get line of the day together, from the unusual suspect  scene.  All right, dude.  This was on our show, I believe.  Goo Goo Dolls, before they were huge.  Oh, yeah?  Good name.  It's better than a commercial.  Listen in.  We'll have line of the day in a sec.  And even though the moment passed me by, I still can't turn away. 
[03:59:00]  Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose, get tossed along the way.  Letters that you never meant to send, get lost and thrown away.  Now we're grown up orphans that never knew their names. 
[03:59:30]  We don't belong to no one, that's a shame.  You could hide beside me, maybe for a while, and I won't tell no one your name.  And I won't tell them your name. 
[04:00:00]  Scars are souvenirs you never lose.  Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?  Did you get to be a star? 
[04:00:30]  Don't it make you sad to know that life is more than who we are?  You grew up way too fast.  Now there's nothing to believe.  When reruns all become more history. 
[04:01:00]  A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio.  And I won't tell no one your name.  And I won't tell him your name.  And I won't tell him your name. 
[04:01:30]  And I won't tell him your name.  I won't tell him your name.  I won't tell him your name.  I won't tell him Tyrand Friedman said.  And that I won't tell him your name.  And I won't tell him your name.  I can never know him.  You're lying.  And your name is sad.  Why doesn't he win?  And I won't tell him your name.  Thanks to Matt Friedman said.  He won't tell him your name.  Until next time he won't tell him your name.  And he won't tell you anything.  He won't tell him why.  But that's a Magazia Show.  What you love do?  I think about you all the time 
[04:02:00]  And I don't need the same  It's lonely where you are  Come back down  And I won't tell them your name  I know it's not. 
[04:02:30]  Ah.  There you go.  Goo Goo Dolls.  Name.  Live on our show back in the day, about ten years ago.  Line of the day, and we'll get out of here.  Right.  Here you go, Iraq, until tomorrow, my friend.  The Unusual Suspect CD, back in its vault.  Come on, dude.  Some great stuff on there, dude.  Oh, dude.  Rock hole.  I'm going to pick my radio co-host out of a stadium, dude. 
[04:03:00]  That's what he did.  Just happened to be a radio guy that we almost hired, but there you go.  It's like, I'm going to announce a ticket number.  And whoever has that ticket number, that's who's going to be my co-host.  And it was a, what a coincidence.  It's a guy that has a radio background.  Wait, what if they lived out of town, or didn't want to do radio?  Oh, Jimmy, stop thinking.  What if they didn't want to do radio?  But they knew who it was. 
[04:03:30]  It was all fixed behind, already.  But what if it was a guy who was, like, what if it was an eight-year-old?  Now, that would be funny, to really do it.  You know, when you get right down to it, this business blows.  It really, really does.  Well, how come nobody just tells the truth?  I don't know, man.  It's just all liars.  Why are they talking phony voices?  I, uh, everyone's lying.  I don't get it.  All right, we got a line, uh, line of the day, line of the day, la, la, la, la. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, boy, I hope I get one today.  I got my marker out in there.  Where is it?  Oh, what do we got?  One line of the day, and we get to go home?  Two runners up.  Oh, my.  Jesus H. Christ.  We've been on for two straight hours without a break.  But we're mailing it in.  We certainly are, Jimmy.  We certainly are.  Whoopi.  Hold on.  Whoopi's on the deal.  Ew, with that thing. 
[04:04:30]  Is she pregnant?  Yeah, she's pregnant again.  Hasselbeck?  Yuck.  My girlfriend wants to slap her so bad, man.  And I know it's going to happen.  I can't wait.  She thinks she gives women a bad name.  I agree with her.  I want to titty fuck Barbara Walters and scream at her.  Ew.  While I'm titty fucking.  Jimmy, couldn't you do that?  There's a phone caller so we could get some outrage going.  Who would be outraged?  Nobody.  You could probably tie her tits in a knot and stick your dick in the knot.  Like, tie it around your dick. 
[04:05:00]  I like Joy Behar.  By the way, my girlfriend will not slap Elizabeth.  This was a little fantasy she had.  Mine will.  So everyone relax.  Punch her.  My girlfriend has actually written on message boards and she's going to, and I quote, drop  kick Barbara in the clit.  Why?  Because she also likes fun, bro.  Whoopie isn't pregnant, you dummies.  Yuck.  Who would fuck that?  Here's your runner-up line of the day. 
[04:05:30]  One of two.  Roy.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to put on, they give you a raincoat because you get soaking wet.  Well, they gave you that so you didn't soak up the whole falls in your hair.  A little dry hair joke.  I want to say to Fast Freddy, you're welcome, sir.  You're welcome.  Wowza, he writes.  We may actually get five minutes of bonus time after vacation.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Radio Gods.  Smartass. 
[04:06:00]  Dude, we didn't take a break, though, so you got to figure that in.  Right.  You know.  Yeah.  We should have taken three breaks.  That's a minimum of five to seven minutes per break.  We gave you guys an extra 20 minutes of radio.  It doesn't look like it because it's only 11.04.  But trust me, that's how it works out in the end.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  What kind of name is Jiven?  I got that on my shoe in the rest area.  I'm like, hey.  You should have left that roll a little more. 
[04:06:30]  I like how you used it as an example.  It was funny when you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are we doing?  The song should be playing.  Oh, yeah.  Line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[04:07:00]  It's E-Rock.  I had three cogs in my ass.  I stuck the mannequin head in my pussy.  Yeah.  Two gold stars.  You got it.  You're just being nice.  That was a good one.  That was good.  All right.  All right.  Let's hit it.  As they say. 
[04:07:30]  So hit it.  That was my out.  Yeah.  So hit it.  Ah!  That was my out.  Yeah.  But I was doing it also.  I was doing it the way they did.  Oh.  Jimmy?  I know how to take us out.  Sham-a-lam-a-ding-dum-how.  I'm going to.  All right.  Good.  She's a cunt who had an affair of Farber.  The CEO said.  CEO Farber.  What was the word you used?  Word.  No.  You said stead. 
[04:08:00]  The, uh.  Oh, boy.  Stead.  The what?  Ah, wait.  Oh, wait.  Uh.  It was a little.  Fucking.  I'll listen during the replay and I'll laugh again.  I don't remember.  Whatever.  Arr.  What's on tomorrow's show?  Tomorrow, we got fucking Jim Norton in studio.  We got Fan and fucking Travis and Danny, if he's not hungover.  E-Rock's neck.  Sam.  E-Rock's neck. 
[04:08:30]  Robbin  Robbin  Robbin  Robbin  Tell him Fred 
[04:09:00]  Hello Fred! Hello Fred! Fred! I invented everything!  I invented everything! </pre>
