<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony "After ONA Live" broadcast, hosted by Sam Roberts, began with a heated, profanity-laced argument between Roberts and Chip Chipperson, resulting in Chipperson's dismissal from the studio.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of a Rashad Evans interview, focusing on anecdotes about Evans' "Uncle Billy."  This segued into a surprisingly popular call-in topic: black squirrels.  A call from Ann mentioned Anthony's swimming plans.  A call from former employee Danny, wearing a Sam Roberts shirt, served as a promotion for an upcoming Opie and Anthony live show in Cleveland.

Next, P. David Ebersole and Todd Hughes, director and editor of the documentary "Hit So Hard" about Hole drummer Patty Schemel, were interviewed. They detailed the documentary's creation, utilizing Schemel's extensive home footage from her time touring with Hole, which included appearances by Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love.  Several callers, including frequent caller Chippa, phoned in with questions about the documentary, prompting discussions of Courtney Love's relationship with Dave Grohl and the challenges of balancing Schemel's story with the prominent figures in the footage.

The show concluded with a segment about Opie's encounter with a homeless man named Andrew.  Opie destroyed a cake Andrew was displaying, generating laughter and outrage among the hosts.  This was followed by a commercial for Steven Singer's Mother's Day roses, further discussion about Jim Norton's purported childhood experiences, a bizarre Kiss-related fantasy, and additional commentary on Roland's Twitter activity, specifically his posting of pictures of E-Rock's home and belongings.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  3SXR  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Everyone's talking business.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Roland trying to pitch guests over there.  What's going on?  I think it would be beneficial to release the image beforehand.  I can hear what you're saying.  Something about an image. 
[00:00:30]  What?  Something about an image.  I'll tell you what we're talking about.  Put my mic on.  It's on.  We're talking about what are you drinking out of your full cup?  Looks like a bunch of Smurf cum or something.  You said that already.  Yeah, I did, but the mics weren't on.  Where are they, cocksucker?  You're a fucking dickhead, shit.  What?  Fucking watch your fucking language.  You're an asshole.  Piece of shit.  Fuck you.  One day, somebody's going to punch you in your fucking mouth.  Yeah, I hope you get fucking punched in there.  I don't want to get punched.  Well, you're going to, you idiot.  Fuck you, piece of shit.  Moron.  Fuck you.  Get the fuck out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Nobody thinks you're funny. 
[00:01:00]  Everyone thinks I'm fucking funny.  Nobody does.  Fuck you, you piece of garbage.  Why don't you get out of here and think about Troy's cock some more?  Why don't you go think about Troy's cock?  It's fucking big, I bet.  I would suck it a lot.  What?  Just.  Chip.  Get out of here, dude.  Just getting weird.  It's a pleasure hearing from Chip Chipperson on After Hope and Anthony Live.  866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969.  What did you learn today on the Opie and Anthony show?  I just learned that Chip wants to suck Troy's dick. 
[00:01:30]  That's one thing I learned on today's show.  I learned a black UFC dude as a white uncle.  Yeah, Uncle Billy.  That was my favorite part of the Rashad Evans interview, the Uncle Billy stories.  And doing the voice and everything.  He's a psychopath.  How many times do you think Rashad Evans has stepped into a cage and envisioned Uncle Billy?  How many times do you think one of our old interns is now a UFC fighter because of all  the shit that we put down there?  Oh, Uncle Sam, Uncle Danny. 
[00:02:00]  It's also like I was, I guess, I guess I had my perception skewed because I was thinking  of like Rashad Evans, even when he was in like elementary school, like in fifth grade.  Like he couldn't beat up a adult UFC fighter, but I figured he was just born like a UFC caliber  fighter.  So in fifth grade, he could beat up everyone in fifth grade.  I think that that's probably the case, too.  I mean, I knew guys back in grades, not grade school, I guess, but like junior high.  And you just knew they were going to be the bruisers like they were just the guys like 
[00:02:30]  they already had the genes.  They were they never worked out a day in their life, but they were cut.  You know, he was probably one of those guys, too.  But then how could he get picked on by Uncle Billy so much?  I don't know.  There's a there's a weird thing that happens just because not not there's not like a physical  intimidation.  Sometimes when someone's older, it's just the fact that they're older.  Yeah.  Is enough cooler.  Like you want to be cool.  That's just enough for the intimidation factor to kick in.  If he tried to fight back, he probably could take Uncle Billy.  Oh, yeah.  But I mean, but at the same time, Uncle Billy, you know, has 15 years on him. 
[00:03:00]  So that just that unknown, that that that X factor of the unknown, I think probably scares  the shit out of you when you're a kid.  How frustrating, too, that Uncle he finally gets a shot in and Uncle Billy and Uncle Billy  goes, oh, this is stupid.  I slipped.  I did that to myself.  I knew a kid like that.  I knew a guy growing up.  He told everybody that he was a karate guy.  Like he was like not a ninja.  He never went around claiming he was a ninja, but he said that he knew like Taekwondo.  He knew martial arts.  Yeah.  He would always do the poses and stuff.  Like his boss.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  So I knew this guy and and he just finally we were all sick of it. 
[00:03:30]  We all kind of hung out in the same group and we knew him and he never was hanging out  in our group.  But we, you know, we knew him and he knew us and whatever.  So one day he was talking all sorts of shit about his karate fucking shit.  And one of my friends was just like, can you jump on phones?  Was just calling him out and said, all right, let's do it.  Let's spar right now.  And my friend just took him down to the ground immediately within 10 seconds.  But then but then the kid karate guy, he was pulling that shit, too.  He's like, oh, no, you see what happened was I was in a weird stance and then my balance 
[00:04:00]  and it was just like, just shut the fuck up.  You got your ass.  Yeah, you would know about the stances because I'm a karate guy.  Like, I know it was a real fight.  You're going to get up and say, oh, well, hang on.  Let's refight because my stance do over, do over.  That one didn't count.  I also learned that black squirrels are the strongest of the squirrels.  I learned that if you want people to call into a radio show, talk about squirrels.  Because people love talking about squirrels.  Boy, oh, boy.  When it was like, where are there black squirrels?  These phones were fucking lit.  Yeah.  Lit up.  Stump Brain emailed me. 
[00:04:30]  Stump Brain, our producer from K-Rock, he emailed me a picture of a white squirrel from his  backyard.  You want to you want to talk to Rashad Evans?  There's three people on the phone.  Do you have black squirrels in your county?  You can't even get through.  Yeah.  I mean, look.  Squirrels are entertaining.  It's serious business.  Ann, in Long Island, what did you learn on the show?  What did I learn on the show?  Yeah.  Well, I learned that Anthony's going home to go swimming because it's the first day of  summer.  A cop-out.  Yeah, I guess.  Great. 
[00:05:00]  You listened to the last five minutes of the show?  No, no, no.  That's not true.  That's not true, Danny.  You know what?  Danny, I'm a wonder.  Where have you been?  You got fired.  Yeah, I got fired.  And then they took me back on as like a creative consultant.  Mm-hmm.  But more, they got me doing like Jay Thomas stuff and stuff like that.  All right, because I was worried about you because I hadn't heard you for a long time.  Because I do, I am, I know you don't believe me, but I am a very, very faithful listener.  I don't believe you.  No, I don't believe it either.  Fuck you.  Well, anyway.  Well, this is how.  Fucking liar.  Well, this is where I am.  The reason I called us to let you guys know, actually, let Sam know that on this beautiful 
[00:05:30]  first day of summer, I am wearing my not Sam shirt.  How many X's come before the other one?  Oh, why would you say it?  It's a small, smarty pants.  It's a small.  A small, extra large?  No.  Like a shrink?  Like you took a 5X and put it through the dryer a few times?  And I'm sure any extra room that gets taken up in that T-shirt is just for them titties.  Right, Ann?  Yeah, there's no stomach in there, I'm sure.  There's not.  How dare you, Danny?  Look, I've been to live events, Sam.  I've been with this show for eight years. 
[00:06:00]  I've seen the kind of women that the show attracts.  Why generalize?  My eyes don't go to live events.  That's right.  Because I'm a closet Opie and Anthony listener.  There's a whole slew of gorgeous women who walk around in Sam Roberts T-shirts that  don't go to Opie and Anthony live events.  They're out there.  Well, you know what?  This is a perfect opportunity for all these cute chicks out there that listen to Opie  and Anthony to prove all of us wrong and show up to this live event that we're doing  in Cleveland.  Opie and Anthony show live in Cleveland Friday the 27th.  It's an afternoon show this time, 4 to 7 at the Hard Rock Cafe with a before Opie and 
[00:06:30]  Anthony live with Sam Roberts.  I didn't even know how I got roped into that.  Yeah, I don't know how you did either.  It just appeared on the paper.  And I said, oh, I am?  Oh, but look, the event is 21 or over.  So, Sam, what if there's like really hot 20-year-old girls that want to come to this?  That's what's going to happen.  And those are the girls who wear the Sam Roberts T-shirts all day.  Right, so I should expect a whole bunch of big, fat 21-year-old slobs, all right?  Exactly.  All of the gorgeous women are just under that age range. 
[00:07:00]  Plus, I don't know if they're in Cleveland.  But...  Well, I'm in Long Island, about two miles from Anthony, so I don't know what to tell you.  I don't know either.  All right.  Thank you, Anne.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Take care.  Goodbye.  Larry in Texas, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hollywood prime time, Sammy Sweetheart Roberts.  I can't express again how much you got a hose over the busted open show.  That's good, Sammy.  I've heard.  I've heard.  It is true.  You were hosed. 
[00:07:30]  Well, I learned that Jimmy's taken a lot of shots to the face.  And Sammy, for the small thing, in Transylvania County, in western North Carolina,  is the home of the white squirrel.  There you go.  It is not an albino squirrel like in Illinois to have albino squirrels.  This is a true white squirrel.  I have them on our property where my wife lives in the mountains.  We have white squirrels on our land.  They're a true white squirrel.  Black squirrels.  All right.  All right.  Larry, it's not squirrels.  It's not that I get it.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:08:00]  I'll talk to you later.  Always a pleasure hearing from Larry from Texas.  Well, Danny, I don't know if you heard about this, but, you know, Patty Schemmel from  Hole, that's how you pronounce that name, right?  Schemmel, the drummer.  I think Schemmel.  What?  Sal.  Schemmel.  I don't know.  I don't know the bandmates by name.  Just read up on something, Sal.  I need you to know something around here.  I'm pretty sure you could just say the drummer from Hole.  She's putting out a documentary.  You guys can come in.  Those guys can come in. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, that's them out there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's putting out a documentary.  Yeah, exactly.  I was like, Danny, I know your predilection is just to say something awful regardless of  the situation.  She just put out a documentary called Hit So Hard, and it's basically following her.  She found all this lost tape of when she was touring with the band.  Come on in, guys.  Sit down wherever is comfortable for you.  Welcome to After Open Anthony Live.  This is P. David Ebersole or just David?  Well, you know, just don't call me late for dinner. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  P. David Ebersole and Todd Hughes.  David, I'll call you David because calling you P. David would just be odd.  You're the director and editor, and you guys both wrote the documentary together.  That's correct.  Well, first of all, what does it mean to write a documentary?  Does it mean to structure the story?  Yeah, we had 40 hours of Patty's home footage that she took when she was on tour during  Live Through This, when she lived with Kurt and Courtney for a while.  And then we had another 40 or so hours of interviews with all the band members, with other people that had toured with Hole. 
[00:09:30]  So, you know, we basically sit at our computers and take all that, and you try to write a script from what people have already said  and put it in an order that makes sense and is compelled.  We start from kind of like an outline of knowing these are the important beats.  We know that these are sort of the tent poles of Patty's story.  Yeah.  And so inside of, like, you know, our editing program, we create bins that are like, so here's the part about this, here's the part about this. 
[00:10:00]  You throw it all together, and then you start to craft the story out of it.  And so, so documentaries are written, yeah.  Yeah.  And Patty, as we said, is the drummer from Hole.  Correct.  And this is when she was filming, just for herself, when the band was enormous, correct?  Yeah, and actually it was before social media and everyone had a telephone.  She had, like, one of the world's first video cameras.  Uh-huh.  So she, you know, you see the audience coming to watch Hole at these stadiums.  Well, not one of the world's first.  Well.  Yeah, I mean, there were a few before, but it was before everybody had a flip camera. 
[00:10:30]  A few times.  But it's amazing when you see the crowd shots at the concerts and everyone's not holding up a phone.  Right.  Everyone's just watching the show and not posting anything.  So it was unusual for back then.  Guys, Patty was given a camera for her for Christmas, and so what she did is that she took it with her.  Everyone else was journaling or taking pictures or all those kind of things, and she used her camera as a way of just recording what was going on.  So she'd hand the camera to crew, to people, to anybody, and say, just film it. 
[00:11:00]  It's amazing seeing it.  Like, you're a friend of hers for a long time, David, correct?  Oh, Todd and I together.  Both of you together.  Yeah.  So I was watching an interview.  She brought you this footage, but she just wanted it digitized.  Like, she didn't plan on putting out this documentary.  What did you think when you started watching all of this footage?  Well, it was really completely by accident, as you say, and what we were doing was just helping her,  and then she would start telling me all these stories that were in and around the footage. 
[00:11:30]  First of all, the footage was amazing, and there are all sorts of things where you're just like,  I cannot believe that the camera is here while this is happening.  I mean, whether they're backstage before a concert and Courtney is destroying her birthday cake,  or, you know, we have some stuff in DVD Extra Features, like they're at Thurston Moore's birthday party backstage,  and everybody's there singing happy birthday to them.  And there's all sorts of things where you're just like, I can't believe the camera is here.  Yeah.  And then there were things about Patty and her journey and what she went through that were just heartbreaking. 
[00:12:00]  She was, you know, she would get off of stage from having played in front of, God,  I don't know how many people that is when they're at those huge festivals,  and she turned the camera on herself to document her own misery, she was saying,  because she just felt so awful at that point.  She had, you know, been hooked on drugs and gone through the ringer,  and she felt like, this is the moment that you've been waiting for, and here I am miserable.  And we were like, wow, there's a story in this that's outside of just sort of saying,  these are somebody's home movies, this is the, we could craft together the story of someone's life and rise. 
[00:12:30]  And that's where the writing and everything comes in.  And all of what they went through.  So, yeah, it was fascinating.  And then, of course, there is that footage that is private, personal footage  from when she lived with Kurt and Courtney with the baby.  She's amazing.  I mean, you never see them that way.  You just never get to see them that way.  A bunch of people are calling, and one of, Chippa is a regular caller to the show,  and one that says he's a fan of Hole, wants to ask something to you guys.  Chippa, you're on the air.  Hi, does this have a lot of stock footage in it, or is it, like, all different stuff? 
[00:13:00]  I was, documentaries are hard.  It's got a ton of...  I was going to make one called A Day with Chippa.  Chippa thinks highly of himself.  No, but it's like, when you make a documentary, you've got to film everything, right?  Like, you just start making filming and footage and stuff, and then when you got the footage,  you just tape it all together, and you're like, whatever, right?  Like, just film.  Well, we were just really lucky because what happened is that Patty delivered us this,  literally, a gold box full of our... 
[00:13:30]  Patty Schemmel, who is the drummer from Hole.  So she came with, like, literally a gold box filled with, you know, never-before-seen stuff.  Yeah.  Right, it was a solid gold box.  Yeah, literally, a gold box.  They had broken out of Fort Knox, and I had to carry it.  And luckily...  I know it was a documentary, because I watched things.  I was watching a movie one time, and I'm like, how long is this?  And I might have said, Chippa, stop chibber-jabbering.  Thank you, Chippa. 
[00:14:00]  Thank you.  Anything else real quick before we get back to the interview?  Yeah, I wanted to know, when they was Hole, was they ever going to call themselves Half?  Semi-circle.  Thank you very much, Chippa.  All right.  I hung up on him.  Thank God.  We're talking like human beings.  How did you...  So you get this incredible footage of Kurt.  And how did you, though...  Because you knew that this was Patty's story you're telling.  And it could easily turn into, oh, I've got to see that movie, because I've got to see what Kurt said. 
[00:14:30]  But, like, how did you keep it Patty's story without, you know, without completely disregarding that footage?  Our first cut was four hours long.  Jesus.  Because we wanted to include everything that her footage touched base on.  They played the Molson's Ice Polar Beach Party with Metallica and Ruka salt up at the North Pole.  Do you remember this?  Not really.  And it was just a, you know, a thing from Molson's Ice Beer.  And it's an incredible story. 
[00:15:00]  And we have all this footage.  But in the four-hour cut, it really was pretty easy to go back.  Does this pertain enough to Patty, or is it just cool?  Right.  You know, so we...  Is a lot of that stuff going to be on DVD extras and stuff like that?  Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff coming, yeah.  We've got, like, about an hour of footage in DVD extras.  But the issue about the footage with Kurt was that, you know, it does pertain to Patty's story.  And that was always our litmus test.  Like, how do we draw this back in?  And, you know, Patty was a good friend of Kurt's before they were all famous. 
[00:15:30]  They were just sort of pals who hung around, you know, gigging up in Seattle.  He was a roadie for the Melvins.  And that's how they got to be friends.  They ultimately come together into this kind of, you know, rocket ride of fame.  And some people survive and some people don't.  And, of course, you know, Kurt, to the world now, is known in this incredibly iconic way.  But to Patty, it's her friend.  Right.  And so, you know, for her, the emotional connection to that.  And then, especially right afterwards, Christian Pfaff, the bassist from Hole, also dying of an overdose. 
[00:16:00]  Just what meant that these people were living on this razor's edge.  And that, if you could feel that going into the story, then you also knew that Patty was in the same place.  And Kurt was closer.  I was in one of the trailers or something.  I didn't get to see the movie because, you know, I haven't been out to see it yet.  Where can people see it?  Right now it's playing all week at Cinema Village in New York.  We open in L.A. on April 19th.  We're doing a huge, big concert and opening at the Vista Theater Movie Palace in Silver Lake. 
[00:16:30]  It's awesome.  Sia's going to sing.  And also, you know, it's going to be really awesome.  And then it plays for another week in L.A.  Then San Francisco the 27th.  Then we go on and on.  So we're rolling out to cities, Chicago.  But all our schedule is on hitsohard.com.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hitsohard.com is the website.  Kurt was closer to the band members in Hole at one point than his own band.  Is that right?  Well, I mean, the fun part of our movie is that, you know, Courtney Love is in it. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  And is interviewed and what she says is very much filtered through the mind of Miss Love.  So Patty says, you know, how close was I to really being in Nirvana?  She's like, Nirvana is an awesome band where Dave Grohl is the drummer and he's an awesome drummer.  So she's like, you know, I played with Kurt.  We had a lot of fun.  And is there true, you know, is there pillow talk truth to the idea that Kurt and Courtney were talking about whether or not Patty should be in Nirvana?  Hard to say.  But but towards the end, again, because she felt so comfortable with Pat. 
[00:17:30]  He felt so comfortable with Patty.  He felt so comfortable with Roddy Bottom from Faith No More, who hung around them a bunch at that point, too.  You know, he was he was not having a lot of friends when things were difficult at the end.  And they were people who were there that he felt like he could talk to.  So, you know, I don't I don't know if there's a if if there's a them against them kind of issue that happened.  But certainly Patty had a lot of access to being able to be his friend.  How much influence did Kurt have on Hole? 
[00:18:00]  When you can especially, you know, when Justice Hole was getting big, that first album, you can hear it.  It sounds like you can hear Kurt a bit in the music.  Well, I think there's you listen to music of that time period and they're all having a ton of influence on each other.  Yeah. But, you know, Todd and I are a husband and husband team.  You know, how much influence do we have on each other's filmmaking?  A ton. Right.  You're living with somebody. You're working with somebody.  You care about what they're doing.  You know, I'm reading his stuff. He's reading my stuff.  We're talking about it.  It's like you're kind of like that's just of course there's some influence in it. 
[00:18:30]  But if you talk to the band members of Hole, which, you know, we which we were lucky enough to be able to do,  they wrote their parts. They worked on their on their songs.  They know what their music was.  And Hole has an incredibly distinct sound that does not sound like Nirvana.  I mean, there's a there's a depth of material that I think was happening because there was an excitement going on in a household full of talent.  Yeah. Did Courtney do new interviews for this or was it just the other footage? 
[00:19:00]  She did it for she did. She did an interview for the movie, which is great and awesome and generous and really private.  And she, you know, just me and Todd in a room interviewing her like a conversation.  She really was honest and great.  And she's shown up. She's been really supportive.  She gifted. She and Eric together gifted all of the music rights to the movie so that the movie could happen.  It's all for Patty. It's not for me. Todd, believe me.  But it's good because she's shown up to the events.  It's not that tension that was there isn't really some of it's been alleviated. 
[00:19:30]  You know, it's impossible not to be in love with Patty Schemmel.  And Courtney is one of those people.  So she's so she she's been really helpful. She's been great.  That's good. Paul actually wanted to ask a question real quick.  Paul, you're on the show.  Hello. Hello.  Yeah, Paul.  Hey, it's Paul Hargis.  Why did Courtney love why she always yelling about Dave Grohl?  How come they don't like each other?  She was saying that he was all doing this and that with Francis Bean or something.  Francis Bean, the Twitter controversy. 
[00:20:00]  I ain't finished.  What happened?  Do you know, I have to say that I don't there's no way to really answer that question about what it is that that keeps the tension between the two of them.  I mean, they're two, you know, strong, powerful individuals who have their own opinions about about the world.  We don't we don't have any insight into into what it is that keeps that kind of thing alive.  She talked about it in the documentary.  Did anybody say, hey, what's going on with you and Dave Grohl over there? 
[00:20:30]  Because there's so much back and forth.  And last name's Grohl.  We you know what?  Hold on a second.  All right.  Paul, your fans love you.  Yeah, I guess so.  Thank you, Paul.  Okay.  Goodbye, Paul.  You got.  Okay. 
[00:21:00]  Thank you, Paul.  I'm going to hang up on you now.  They're a hostile group that listens to this channel.  I don't know why it is.  I was just looking at you, not at us.  Yeah.  So that's good.  I was just looking at the news breaks for here.  And they actually have Courtney Love reunites with Hole.  I was going to ask you guys about that.  Were you guys there?  When was that?  It was the other night.  It was Friday night.  Friday night when Hole reunited out of nowhere.  Well, and it was all, it was, it was the after party for the hit so hard premiere.  We already knew that the three members of Hole were, were coming to play. 
[00:21:30]  They had been rehearsing and putting things together.  And very last minute, we got the, the text of like, Courtney wants to come.  And it was like, send a car and she's going to come on over.  So they had.  You guys must have been flipping out.  They had songs.  They had things that were rehearsed.  It was, you know, it was a beautiful, amazing moment.  I mean, for the fans in the audience.  We were flipping out, but other people there were doing cartwheels.  And if you've watched the video, you can hear this girl screaming like, oh my God, I love you. 
[00:22:00]  It's amazing that Hole has, you know, their fan base is so.  Devoted.  Yeah, that it's been close to 20 years at this point.  15 years since they've played together on stage, this lineup.  Since they've played together on stage.  This is the classic lineup of Hole, you know, with, with Eric, Melissa, Patty and Courtney together.  You know, there have been other lineups, but it's the one that people consider the classic lineup.  And like you were saying in the movie, hit so hard is the name of the movie.  Um, it's Patty's story and Patty was a severe drug addict. 
[00:22:30]  Um, and there's, there's footage of her in that state that she took and she shot and she kind of, did she, was she protective of herself?  Did she want to see things before you put it in or was she kind of trusting with you, with you guys?  She was super trusting with us.  But remember, this took us four years to make and from the first time we sat down and showed her a cut that clearly was very uncomfortable for her to see herself that way. 
[00:23:00]  It took a lot of trust for us that we were telling the story as well as it could be told to allow us to use that footage and show people what she was going through.  And it's, you know, it's hard for everyone to watch.  But she went into it with a ton of bravery and with an idea that she wanted her story to finally be told, uh, that she felt like that, uh, that being honest to the core, uh, because she talks all the way about, you know, being homeless and how she survived on the streets, uh, that that might end up helping young people who then found themselves in a similar position. 
[00:23:30]  And so she just said, you know what, if I'm going to do it, I have to do it.  Yeah.  So she, the, there is one very famous piece of footage that she says was not allowed to be in the movie whatsoever.  And it's Patty in female drag wearing a dress and a wig.  And she was like, okay guys, and that's not in the movie.  And that's just sheer embarrassment.  Um, what was, you know, going through all this tape for both of you, what was the most amazing thing to see? 
[00:24:00]  Because, I mean, it's good to hear that Patty wanted everything shown because it's like, you don't get, especially as fans, you don't get an experience to see any of this, let alone all of this.  What was the most amazing thing that you guys saw going through it?  Well, Patty is a comedian.  So there was a lot of really funny stuff.  For me, it was just watching these home movies on your television at home.  And is that Fred Schneider?  Oh yeah.  Oh, are those the Go-Go's?  Yeah, we were touring.  You know, they were backstage hanging out. 
[00:24:30]  And it's like, wow.  Sonic Youth, Pavement, uh, you know, Offspring, Metallica, Veruca Salt.  Like all the people who were just like, oh yeah, yeah, oh, I think they were there.  I think they were hanging out.  Yeah.  So that was part of it was just to get to see the backstage culture that was, that was there.  Well, it's always amazing to, to see these and like curtain people.  Hey, you interrupted me.  Hey.  To see these iconic people.  And they're humanized.  Like they're like hanging out.  And you're like, I didn't think these people hung out. 
[00:25:00]  They're just performers and they're deities and they're whatever they are.  And their dressing rooms look really crappy.  And, you know, it's really hot.  And they're all sitting around one fan and splitting the one deer.  I think that was the most amazing thing about the footage.  And this goes all the way to the sort of, you know, amazing never before seen curtain Courtney stuff, which is that they, they get portrayed on this certain iconic level.  And for us from the beginning, one of the things that we thought was really interesting about even making this movie was to rehumanize, make people, you know, real people that were friends with each other that went through an experience. 
[00:25:30]  And so to identify with Patty in the end and then to think to yourself, wow, if I go through something really difficult, I can survive.  You kind of have to get into that level of saying this is just a regular person who had things come at them that attacked them from Kurt, you know, to Patty.  So that's why I say that's why we really felt like that footage fit in.  Because you need to bring Kurt Cobain back down to the level of understanding.  He's just a guy who was in love, who had a baby, who was an incredible creative force. 
[00:26:00]  And his stuff got taken and put up on this crazy platform that was very hard to get through and survive.  Yeah, I mean, it was an amazing era in music and pop culture and everything.  And just the clips that I've seen, I'm dumbfounded that even exist, and this is the first time we're seeing them.  So I would definitely encourage everybody to check out the movie.  It's called Hit So Hard. What's the website again? 
[00:26:30]  Hitsohard.com.  Hitsohard.com is where you can go to it.  Thank you guys for stopping by.  Absolutely.  And we wanted to play Opie's Encounter with Homeless Andrew.  We mentioned it on Friday, and we didn't get a chance to play it.  So you got that over there, Iraq?  Yep, all good.  All right.  Hitsohard.com.  Check out the movie when you get a chance.  Thanks again, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  After O&E Live.  Is this Andrew?  Hey, Andrew.  Wow, where's it been?  How you doing, Andrew?  I love watching the decline of Andrew. 
[00:27:00]  Andrew, where the fuck you been?  Andrew, they're taking your spot over there.  The guy took your spot with a box and a cat.  And my spot is a lost spot.  Well, yeah.  They're taking Rob last day.  Paid that to me on his money.  Are you cold?  Are you cold today?  I'm cold.  Of course I'm cold.  Oh, you're a little drunk.  You look a little woozy today.  You look a little drunk.  No, I'm not drunk, but I had a couple of views.  A couple when?  About an hour ago?  Last night.  Oh, last night?  Yeah.  Partying with the guys?  What's in the box? 
[00:27:30]  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  Oh, what is it?  Wow, that looks good, but I am not touching it.  You eat it, Andrew.  No, it's some kind of a cinnamon cakey thing.  Oh, I had to walk away.  Oh, no.  I'm leaving.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, he didn't do that. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, he did not do that.  I'm there.  Oh, no.  He did not just fucking.  Oh, no.  You knew it was coming right when I was.  Hey, let me see that.  It was a full cake.  It was a full cake.  He opened it up and was offering a slice.  Opie grabbed it, put it on the sidewalk, and jumped as high as he could and landed on  top of the cake.  Oh, no.  Opie throws money at him, and as it's going towards him, the wind picks it and blows it 
[00:28:30]  down the street.  Oh, no.  He's like, just go fuck yourself.  As soon.  Oh, is that awful?  Oh, I know.  As soon as you put it down, I actually walked away, and I saw you jump up, and I walked  away.  And just heard that smashing of cake under his feet.  You are despicable.  Oh, what a piece of shit.  Oh, that was his whole meal for like a week with that cake.  He was happy to show everyone the cake. 
[00:29:00]  He goes, look.  Both feet landed right in that cake.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that was beautiful.  Oh, it was so cringe-inducing, yet fun to watch.  Oh, my God.  You are horrible.  Please get that video up on YouTube immediately.  Thank God it was on tape.  Oh, no.  Oh, that is going to be a great download, man.  Right when he grabs, I got it right when Opie said, oh, let me see it.  I'm like, that cake is fucking gone. 
[00:29:30]  That cake is dead.  You know where I knew I was in trouble?  When I heard, what's in the box?  Oh, dude.  Watch your back, bro.  What a horrid man.  Dude, you have fucking issues.  We got a good video?  God damn.  You got issues.  That makes me just so happy.  Wow.  He was so proud of his cake.  It was all like sliced and everything.  Oh, my ribs hurt.  It was all pre-sliced. 
[00:30:00]  He was so proud of his cake.  Oh, that was a fucking fantastic cake.  Two big feet.  That was a holy grail for homeless people.  It was an unopened, plastic-covered, sliced clump cake.  God, that looked good.  I'm fucking starving.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the poor bum.  You know what I'm so looking forward to?  He was offering everyone a piece.  Anyone keeping score now?  Opie's feet has claimed a cake and a dog.  But that was both feet center and the plastic popped. 
[00:30:30]  Right in the middle of the cake.  It was such a good jump.  The plastic popped.  And the cake squeezed.  Of course, she doesn't want to laugh, but.  After ONA Live.  Never, ever gets old.  Opie stomping home with Andrew's cake.  Here on After Opie Anything Live.  Big thanks to P. David Ebersole and Todd Hughes for stopping by.  They made Hit So Hard, which is the Patty Schemmel documentary.

What was going on with your voice there?  When?  In the middle of the read.  You started...  And then came right back.  I recovered nicely.  Yeah, you did.  I had some spit in my mouth.  That's what happened.  Next time, I need you to come in here and drain it while I'm doing live reads because I can't be...  Well, you don't need to be professional.  I mean, they eat and stop in the middle of reads to, you know, spit into the garbage can or yell at somebody. 
[00:33:00]  Do you know what after Opie and Anthony Live is, Eric?  It's excellence in broadcasting.  That's the standard I hold myself to.  Excellence in broadcasting with Sam Roberts.  Since when?  Since always, Eric.  Oh.  Since always.  That's what I learned today.  What?  The after show is excellence in broadcasting.  Well, it is.  By the way, speaking of sheer excellence, Troy and I took some time while the show was on today to work on a bit with Club Soda Kenny. 
[00:33:30]  I was getting a lot of tweets all weekend about people who had the Call Me Maybe song stuck in their head.  I got those too, yeah.  Yeah.  Let's just say Club Soda Kenny has the fever too.  I'll leave it at that.  But let's just say tomorrow...  Wow, you converted somebody.  Tomorrow we're going to have something to play for you.  Now, I was surprised that you guys calling in when we were talking about the Hit So Hard movie, the whole documentary, you guys were all angry. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, I don't know, Paul Hargis seemed to have a problem.  Chippa had a problem.  I don't know what the deal was with those guys, but I almost wish I hadn't taken their call.  I thought they were going to ask legitimate whole questions.  Apparently not.  They did, a little bit, have a Jim Norton vibe to them.  I don't know what that was, but a little bit of a Jim Norton vibe.  Today, when we had Sugar Rashad Evans on, Norton took a punch from him, a couple punches actually, one in each arm.  I believe Opie will have the video for that up on Opie Radio on YouTube probably later today, I would think. 
[00:34:30]  He's a very timely guy.  They may have it up on UFC at some point.  They were in here taping.  UFC, and I guess they were from FX, I don't know what now, but UFC themselves, they were in here with giant cameras.  I was in here on my bootleg $35 Best Buy tripod and my, you know, bottom-of-the-line handy cam,  while these TV guys were in these tripods that you couldn't knock over with a tank and giant size-of-a-person television cameras. 
[00:35:00]  It was an amazing thing.  I was just glad we had this lighting in the studio.  Thank God we had it on time.  Otherwise, we would have looked like real assholes in here.  Real two-bit dopes.  As opposed to every other day.  That's right.  But, Jim was, uh, he got hit twice.  And ONA started talking to him about, look, Jim, this is a weird thing.  Like, you obviously like to get hurt by the guys you look up to.  They referenced a fantasy that Jim had about the band Kiss.  Jim is a huge fan of Kiss. 
[00:35:30]  But he's always wanted them to hurt him and love him.  E-Rock, you found the original story, right?  Of Jim telling the Kiss fantasy?  Of Kiss, yes.  His dream when he was a kid?  This was mixed, it's cut and pasted together, I think it sounds all right.  It was mixed in between Village People, Kiss, Helen, Jimmy Robinson.  Like, there was five different stories going on at the same time.  He had a weird childhood.  He was obviously molested by a lot of different people.  A lot of different people. 
[00:36:00]  Like, I'm saying a weekly molestation was what I would think happened.  He says no.  He says no, but he wouldn't remember, would he?  If you were getting molested every single week, I think that would be a memory you would  at least try to wipe out.  I think you would remember it if it was every week.  No, that's what the thing is.  It's so, if you got molested once, you would probably remember it because it was traumatic.  If you got molested once a week, that is so bad and humiliating and painful, that's  what you're going to want to wipe out.  Well, what happens when a guy gets molested when he's a kid? 
[00:36:30]  He has weird fantasies about his idols.  This is Jim talking about his dreams of kiss here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  So, the Village People.  They were good lives.  Sister Sledge, We Are Family, was a big hit.  We didn't enjoy Sister Sledge.  Did you have Village People posters in your room?  I might have.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  What did you dress up like?  No, I didn't dress up.  Oh, that would have been cute.  Jimmy went dressed up like a little cowboy or something. 
[00:37:00]  No, I think Glenn was one of the guys, too.  I don't remember all their names.  Of course, it was Glenn.  There was the construction worker, of course.  I didn't know they were gay.  I didn't get it.  I didn't know Village meant 14th Street to Houston.  I mean, I didn't realize that.  You thought it was like a village.  Like a village of cool people.  Right.  Where all men worked and sang.  Cool people.  They were cool.  The Indian was my favorite.  Growing up, the Indian was my favorite.  I thought he was the coolest.  Yeah.  Dude, I was about 10 and I knew they were gay.  And I didn't even know what gay meant. 
[00:37:30]  No, I was very young.  I didn't understand.  I didn't know that.  I just knew that's not how they dress when they're out on the street doing those professions.  I didn't know.  All these things add up, though.  The Monster Rain, this, the playing asteroids for a...  I was a weirdo.  You were a weird little kid.  Don't say was.  I used to fantasize.  It bothers me that you think there's a was in that sentence.  Kiss were my heroes.  Kiss in the 70s.  Well, Kiss was all our heroes.  And I used to fantasize.  I bought every Kiss album.  So did I.  Well, it was bought from me.  But I used to fantasize about Kiss.  Not sexually, but that they would come to my house. 
[00:38:00]  I had a problem that they wore makeup.  I was a little uncomfortable with the Kiss makeup thing.  No, that's why I liked them.  That's why.  Because they were like superheroes.  They were like superheroes.  I got to hear this fantasy.  That they would come...  This was a recurring one.  That Kiss would come to my apartment and hurt me and kick me down the stairs and beat me.  And then hug me and love me and make me feel better.  You're kidding.  No.  To please tell me...  Oh, no.  That was a...  This is a joke.  That was a recurring fantasy.  It was never sexual, though.  It was about...  Like, I don't know why I associated...  Because I had a pretty normal household.  I always associated that uncomfortability with love. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Have you ever met his parents?  They're very nice, normal people.  They're the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Never abusive.  They were really great to grow up with.  So where did this come from?  Oh, my dad drank a little abusive.  Why would you have this fantasy that Kiss...  Don't know.  Kiss comes to your house.  Now, do they knock?  Or are they just there?  Don't remember.  I can just remember my steps in my house and picturing Paul and Gene and all of them loving  me and making me feel better and hugging me and telling me I was a good boy.  But they're the ones that beat you.  That's the oddness of it.  The Kiss thing. 
[00:39:00]  You'd be a Kiss fan.  That's fine.  But you would be a Kiss fan without the images of them beating you up and then...  Granted, it's bizarre.  ...coddling you and saying it's all going to be okay.  And hugging...  I told you, I got my picture with Kiss recently.  The first time I'd ever met...  I mean, with Gene, I was starstruck.  You were scared you were going to get bitch slapped by Paul Stanley.  Dude, when he...  Did Paul and your band of Stanley to bitch slap you?  He didn't bitch slap.  Oh, in the thing.  He put it...  Behind the...  Behind the...  Your fantasy, did he hold your head close to his puffy hair chest?  No, dude.  It wasn't about sexual stuff.  Hello, everybody!  Dude, he...  Black God of Colonel Jim and Naughton! 
[00:39:30]  He, from behind me...  I had the photo.  You could see the photo.  I'm standing there.  He reaches around behind me and puts his arm on my chest.  This is last November.  I tilted my head and put it on his bicep.  It was like a childhood hero thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was like...  I almost held his arms.  I didn't do it.  It was your fantasy come true.  It wasn't about sex.  I'm not a...  You know, I don't want to touch Paul Stanley, but it was like...  I...  It was like a superhero.  That's another part of the weirdness.  He would like for you to touch him.  Yeah, probably.  That's another part of the weirdness.  If you said you had some kind of physical attraction and it was a sexual thing, it would 
[00:40:00]  be disgusting to me, but...  But the thing is, it's creepy.  Yeah.  That you just wanted them to say, you know, to like your company and love you and...  Yeah, and be my friend and hug me.  And beating you.  After kicking me down the steps and beating me up.  After ONA.  Live.  And I just love the Paul Stanley voice.  Hello, everybody!  That was Jim and his twisted, dark fantasies.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  That's how old that bit is.  How old?  2004.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  That's how...  Eight years ago?  No.  No.  Well, yeah.  2004 was eight years ago.  It would be...  It would be eight years come November for that bit.  That's crazy.  Do you ever feel that way about Hulk Hogan when you were growing up?  No, I never had visions of people coming to my house to make me feel better or better  to play or anything.  What about the genius Lanny Poffo?  The professor? 
[00:41:00]  You know, he could suck his own dick.  Yeah.  You knew that?  Yes, because you brought it up multiple times, including talking to him, I think.  I asked him about it.  Yes.  He said, well, can you?  And I said, no.  And he goes, that means you've tried.  You are a genius, Lanny Poffo.  What's been up with Roland on his Twitter tweeting pictures of your house and your backyard?  I have no idea.  But I get a lot...  I get people either like, I want to come over, there's a fight between me and Ann who has 
[00:41:30]  the better house, or I fucking hate you.  Roland's been tweeting pictures of luxurious pools and houses and balconies and rooms and  just saying, hey, look, everybody, at E-Rock Radio's living room, at E-Rock Radio's  pool.  That's two...  Who knew I had a biodome?  By the way, that's two Twitter plugs that I should not have given you.  What?  At E-Rock Radio on Twitter?  Ah, you snuck in another one.  Well, you should have probably done Club Soda Kenny on Facebook, then.  Roland.  There's more pictures coming for the fans than once he's house in the Star Wars collection. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, that was the other thing.  Oh, right, right.  He tweets this picture of a giant collection.  Roland tweets this picture of a giant collection of Star Wars toys.  It's just a part of Eric's collection.  And he goes, this is just a part of Eric's collection.  And Eric puts Star Wars in the background.  He kind of rub it in.  You got people who work here now retweeting Eric saying, you like Star Trek or Star Wars?  And Eric's like, no, I don't know what he's talking about.  Or my favorite, though.  Hold on.  Annabella came to you and go, did you see his kitchen?  Holy fuck!  Annabella's a talent booker here. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  She was shocked by his kitchen.  Roland posted a photo saying this was my Star Wars collection that got picked up by  multiple fan sites.  Roland, what is up with your Twitter?  You have a powerful Twitter.  I do.  I'm a New York Habitatist now following me.  They retweeted my pictures.  Well, you got E-Rock's Star Wars collection getting tweeted in the news.  You have Governor Christie getting tweeted in the news.  Yeah.  Are you an eye reporter?  Is that what it is?  Now I tweet something.  I look at all these Twitter, these news sites retweeting. 
[00:43:00]  I'm like, what's going on?  All right.  Let's go down.  We'll check the AP.  We'll check Rolando's 99 on Twitter.  It's hilarious.  We got all the scoops today.  Yeah, because one diehard Star Wars geek fan, they said they want to come up with me, Eric,  and shake his hand because he's almost as equal to him in Star Wars geekdom.  Almost.  He's almost there.  But I'm on the Twitter.  Eric, well, his wife might get mad.  But Eric bought a DeLorean, like, Back to the Future, that I'm going to tweet. 
[00:43:30]  It's in his backyard.  Whoa, Eric, congratulations, Moneybags.  I'm going to tweet that later.  Have you actually been to Eric's house?  Yes.  I took pictures.  Those were the pictures of from his house.  Then how come?  No, I'm going to tweet some more from Florida.  I went to Florida and took pictures of his house.  How come when I go into your office, there's a web window open with a Google search that says,  Fancy House.  Big Star Wars collection.  The other day, he was searching for images for waterfalls. 
[00:44:00]  People actually believe this, even though one of your tweets was,  Whoa, guys, look at Eric's biodome in his backyard.  Eric's wife is very, like, she's green.  She goes green.  You have a biodome in your backyard, Eric?  Apparently.  I haven't gotten to that section of the house yet.  And also, he has a panther.  He has a pet.  You have a pet panther.  A baby black panther.  Wow, that's amazing.  Aren't you worried that it's going to grow up and maul you?  No, they love him.  They do.  They give him lots of love and everything? 
[00:44:30]  Just like Skeletor.  How was the, uh...  That's right.  How was the, uh...  How was the whole interview?  I didn't listen to it.  I had to go run downstairs.  So you didn't hear the calls?  No, I figured.  There were a couple of fans called in.  Uh, one was Paul Hargis, who didn't like that I was interrupting him and being a smart aleck.  And, uh, Chippa called in.  Not, uh...  Was it Edgar?  Edgar did not.  I was expecting Edgar to call in.  But what happened was, I was talking to them while the bit was playing on their way out. 
[00:45:00]  And, uh...  And they go, yeah, I said, thanks for coming in.  That was great.  You know, it really does look amazing, the documentary.  And they go, yeah, thanks for having us.  Sorry your listeners are so mad at you.  Oh, yeah, well...  Oh, who's that other character?  Hey, hey, hey, that guy.  I thought you were going to call in.  Josh Goodnaturedly.  See, I thought you were going to call in.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Well, listen.  We have to go.  I know that, Eric.  I was winding down.  Also, for the fans, I'm on Twitter.  I got, uh, new pictures of Eric's home in Florida that he just bought. 
[00:45:30]  So you have that to look forward to.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  They got a big show, as always.  And we'll be back with more of this. </pre>
