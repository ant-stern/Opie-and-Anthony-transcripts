<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' usual boisterous introductions, employing their signature suggestive nicknames.  They immediately transitioned to discussing the impending New York City snowstorm, contrasting the anticipated level of preparedness with that of Oswego, highlighting perceived disparities in resource allocation between wealthier and poorer regions.  The conversation quickly shifted to their internal frustrations with their employers, detailing a strained relationship between their terrestrial and XM radio operations.  They described a lack of communication and support from management, exemplified by a dismissive phone call concerning their planned two-week vacation, using the analogy of a mechanic fixing a Ferrari with only pliers to illustrate their creative limitations.  Their dissatisfaction extended to the quality of guests offered to them, characterizing the process as a transactional exchange forcing them to interview undesirable guests to secure more high-profile individuals.

The show then delved into the media coverage of Anna Nicole Smith's death and the ensuing paternity claims surrounding her daughter, expressing disgust at the sensationalism and opportunistic behavior of those involved, particularly focusing on Howard K. Stern's tearful million-dollar interview.  They segued into a discussion of Zsa Zsa Gabor, utilizing quotes from Cindy Adams' New York Post column to paint a humorous, and unflattering, picture of her life and her significantly younger husband. This segment included numerous crude and graphic descriptions of Gabor's physical appearance, using terms like "rotten old corpse," "Play-Doh bones," and "fat pig," interspersed with humorous Gabor quotes.  Mongo the Trucker called in briefly, followed by a short audio clip of unclear content.

Opie then shared extensive details of his divorce, recounting numerous negative experiences and detailing his ex-wife's erratic behavior, anger outbursts, and public embarrassments, including anecdotes such as her falling into sewage at Watch Hill and a fight with his brother at his wedding. He also described her long, "claw-like" fingernails.  The discussion transitioned to Valentine's Day cards and the challenges of writing romantic messages, prompting listener calls offering suggestions and further off-color jokes about relationships and marriage.  A clip from Tyra Banks' show featuring a woman with trimethylaminuria ("fish odor syndrome") led to more jokes about the condition.

A caller's offensive remark about learning initiated a segment on a woman with severe body odor, detailed in graphic terms, followed by more listener calls with off-color comments on the woman’s smell.  Listeners then called in describing what they learned from the show, with responses ranging from humorous to crude.  The hosts discussed an advertisement for a push-up bra for larger women, making several fat-phobic jokes.  They announced Otto and George's upcoming appearance on David Letterman and discussed their own popularity and criticisms, along with a popular Anthony-created YouTube video.  A significant portion was dedicated to a discussion of 1980s one-hit wonders, interspersed with vulgar jokes.  Comedian Ralphie May was in the studio during this portion.  The segment concluded with further discussion of their YouTube video, their relationship with listeners and management, and additional vulgar jokes and anecdotes.

A chaotic in-studio and outside-studio interview with Steven J. Backman, a toothpick artist bumped from the David Letterman show, followed. They discussed his intricate toothpick art, featuring recreations of landmarks and celebrity portraits.  Numerous phone calls interrupted the interview, and a running gag about Backman being a Marine sniper due to his precision emerged.  A news story about a 10-year-old girl charged with assault at a Target was also mentioned.  The conversation included numerous off-color jokes and homophobic and racist remarks.  Ralphie May was again mentioned as being in the studio.  Backman's agitated reaction to his artwork being shown online without permission culminated in a physical comedy scene involving him grabbing his portfolio and attempting to leave, leading to a comical chase and standoff involving the hosts, staff, and Backman’s artwork.  The segment concluded abruptly with the hosts discussing the unfolding events outside the studio, Backman's distress, and the staff's playful pranks.

The final segment detailed a prank involving an "Asian guy" visiting the studio.  The hosts and crew secretly placed mustard on him, leading to his visible distress, temporary departure from the studio, and eventual return.  The guest's online presence (40 million website hits in three months) and his profession as a toothpick artist ("toothpickart.com") were discussed. The hosts expressed discomfort and embarrassment about the prank's escalation, noting that some crew members left due to the discomfort, and that poker chips were thrown at the guest.  The segment ended with self-deprecating remarks and discussion of their upcoming appearances and schedules.  The overall tone was chaotic and profanity-laden throughout the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton.  Look at this face, how do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you. 
[00:00:30]  Sex Vagel.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Thank God.  Did I just hear a new intro to the Opie and Anthony Show?  Thank goodness.  I do believe that was brand new, huh?  It's a virus. 
[00:01:00]  One more of that.  How is everybody this morning?  I think the word is ducky.  Just ducky.  Just ducky?  Ugh.  Time to wake up.  Wake up, everybody.  Wake up.  Your alarm just went, don't eat that snooze.  No, no, no, no, no.  You have work to do. 
[00:01:30]  Get up.  I see you're reaching over, hitting that snooze alarm.  Get up.  If we're going to be miserable, everyone's going to be miserable.  Miserable.  Miserable.  Got a dark cloud looming over our heads for later. 
[00:02:00]  Our first snowstorm is coming to New York City.  Ah, yeah.  It's just horrific.  So there's dark clouds looming.  Oh, it's just like living in Oswego, New York, you dummies.  If it goes okay, we'll get about four inches in the city, right?  Before it changes over to rain and washes it all away, and there's no problem.  But they're juxtapositioning the Oswego storm with our storm. 
[00:02:30]  I love the juxtaposition.  They'll show like 12 to 15 feet of snow, whatever the hell they're up to in Oswego.  There's a reason people live in Oswego, New York.  Why?  Because they're poor.  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  Poor people tend to live where it snows above your house.  Here's the rule of thumb.  If you have to use a snowblower on your roof, move.  Yeah, you see people doing that.  We've talked about this from time to time on our show. 
[00:03:00]  A long, long time ago, our ancestors figured out all the cool places to live.  Yeah.  The good places.  There's a reason why they decided not to build New York City in Oswego, New York.  Yeah, because it's miserable.  Like, who knows, probably a century and a half ago, they said, you know what?  This area gets a lot of snow.  We're not going to get a lot done between December and May. 
[00:03:30]  Most of the time is going to be spent buried in.  Yeah.  Especially back then when they didn't have any of the cool stuff to clear the snow away.  Oh, it's just classic when they're on their roofs like that, shoveling and snow blowing.  Oh.  Anyways, anyway, they're kind of showing the latest footage from Oswego.  And then they seg into the local douchecaster here in New York City.  They are.  And they're hinting.  They're trying to make it look like the same thing might happen here. 
[00:04:00]  Well, snow on the way.  Is it really?  Do we have anything to worry about like Oswego, New York?  Well, there's a Chang Wang over at whatever her name is over on the west side showing that the salt spreaders are all loaded with salt.  The plows have the plow blades on the front so they're ready to go.  And she said, this is good news for everybody.  Good news.  Because if they weren't ready, everything would ice over and we would just be stuck. 
[00:04:30]  But like we have for the past 30 years, pretty much, I would say, safely, 30 years.  Was she thinking that?  There's never been a problem.  Was she thinking that maybe this time around the fellas wouldn't do their jobs?  The guys would hear that there might be snow and just go, ah, you know what?  Leave the plows in the garage.  We're going to just, nah, salt, screw it.  I want to see people slide around.  Yeah, well, so whatever.  We're getting a little snow.  Don't worry about it. 
[00:05:00]  Well, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Freedom.  Freedom.  Freedom.  Where do we begin?  We could begin with the fine phone call I got as I was trying to get dinner last night.  Oh, God.  When they love you, they love you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Kissy, kissy, kissy.  That's what it is.  Anything you can do.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[00:05:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  Ugh.  And then when things are a little shaky, oh, boy, do they turn.  Oh, they turn.  Everything becomes a major malfunction.  They become nudges.  Nudge.  And party poopers.  Party poopers.  Nudges and party poopers. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, but when we first started back on regular radio and the ratings were way up.  Hey.  Hey.  Whatever you want.  Guys.  Hugs and kisses.  Now.  Expensive dinners.  Now.  Phone calls.  Bad phone calls.  What are you?  What?  Really bad phone calls.  Barely a hello.  How you doing?  How have you been?  No, none of that.  None of that.  Right to the point.  Right to the point. 
[00:06:30]  It's right to the point guy now.  That's who you get on the phone.  I can tell you this much.  We're in a really, really bizarre position.  We work for two companies.  I think people know that by now.  We do a show for XM Satellite Radio, and we're also on regular radio.  The first half of the show, which a lot of you listen to right now, is on regular radio.  And then we continue over at XM.  And we work for two companies, but the two companies don't have any real desire.  To even acknowledge the other one.  To communicate. 
[00:07:00]  Or work together.  Yeah.  Or communicate.  Yeah.  It's the nature of this beast.  I once tried to mention something XM was telling us over here.  And this person said, I don't want to hear that.  They don't have my best interest at hand.  Yeah.  Like, oh, this is just great.  It's not one of these storybook romances.  It's sort of a relationship out of necessity.  Mm-hmm.  Is how this whole thing started out. 
[00:07:30]  You know?  You got, all right.  Look.  We need this.  You need this.  Here you go.  Here's the common denominator.  Let's somehow figure this out.  But let it be known, I don't really like you.  I don't want to talk to you.  And this is where we're in a weird position.  Every day we leave here right around nine.  Mm-hmm.  And we go over to XM where there's nothing but praise and love all around.  They just love us over there. 
[00:08:00]  In constant contact.  Because God knows how they calculate who's listening and how many people.  Right.  God only knows what kind of witchcraft they use over there.  They help out the show whenever we want.  They never say no.  We pretty much get away with murder over there.  Let's be honest.  Well.  And then we're over here.  A little water drinking contest.  Yeah.  And we're over here in the beginning of the morning where it doesn't feel that good,  to be quite honest with you.  It just doesn't feel that good. 
[00:08:30]  It's a weird situation.  It doesn't feel that good.  You know, we were obviously brought in to bail out a failing franchise.  To bail out the entire radio.  You know, they got...  No, dude, to bail out the entire radio division.  Yeah.  Okay.  They got Howard in there, of course, many, many years, doing very well.  He goes over to satellite.  They put David Lee Roth in. 
[00:09:00]  That was a disaster.  So they had to bring someone in with a name.  So they bring us in.  And we absolutely could get the job done.  We want to do that.  That's what we wanted to do.  But it is just the obstacles that are there.  And then they say, no, sit down.  Let's talk about the obstacles.  There's no talking about them.  There's no...  It's at the point...  It's just that talk.  It's just that talk to make you feel a little better.  And then it goes right back to pretty much what it is.  Oh, don't say there. 
[00:09:30]  Go ahead.  I equate it to a mechanic, a very good mechanic, being told to do all your work with just a pair of pliers.  Everything you need to do, well, you're a mechanic, right?  We'll fix this car.  This used to be a top-of-the-line Ferrari.  It was in great shape.  It's broken down now.  But we want you to make it back into what it was.  Here's a pair of pliers.  Could I use a socket wrench? 
[00:10:00]  It said, no, don't even talk about the socket wrenches.  Don't bring them in.  What about some diagnostic equipment?  We're not allowed to use that.  It's company policy that there are no socket wrenches or diagnostic equipment to be used.  You have a pair of pliers.  Use those.  But it's very difficult to work with just a pair of pliers on that.  Look, we'll work with you.  What kind of pliers do you need?  No, we need more than pliers.  We need the ability to put the car up on a lift and check the undercarriage and sometimes put our finger in the tailpipe of the car. 
[00:10:30]  That's right.  That's what we need.  But for some reason, we can't even diddle the carburetor.  It's not allowed.  But let's talk about it.  Yeah.  I'm done talking.  We know where it's dangerous.  We don't want to take our mouths and put them over the tailpipe and just suck on the tailpipe, breathing in until we kill ourselves. 
[00:11:00]  It's not what we're looking to do.  No.  We just want the tools to fix the car.  We want to be able to look under the hood.  Under the hood.  We can't even look under the hood.  Can we lift up the hood?  We can't even look under the hood.  And look at what every guy wants to look at.  The engine.  Take a good look.  Make sure it's lubed up real nice.  We can't even bring a car in here and lift the hood.  No.  Maybe shove something up the tailpipe to make sure there's no debris in there. 
[00:11:30]  That's all we're asking for.  A little freedom to fix this car.  So when we first started back on regular radio, the ratings were very nice.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Yeah.  And then there was praise.  Hey.  Whatever you guys want.  I don't care.  Oh, this went so well.  God, I don't care as long as the ratings are where they're at.  Do whatever you want.  Went so easy.  And we've made some hints. 
[00:12:00]  We've had a couple months here that it's a little...  Depending on what city you're listening from.  Yeah.  Some cities are doing fine.  Some cities were just destroying and others are just...  Unfortunately.  But some of the cities that are bigger markets.  Yeah.  So now, the whole, ah, whatever you guys need, has been replaced with a very rude phone call  yesterday.  My, ah.  And getting dinner. 
[00:12:30]  And it's one of the bosses.  And I go, hello?  And he goes, is it true that Anthony...  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  That's not...  He goes, is it true that you guys are taking two weeks off in May?  Hoo-hoo.  I'm like, uh, yeah.  Well, this is unacceptable.  Huh?  This is one of the voices that was, ah, whatever you guys need.  Now it's right to the point.  Not even, hi, how you're doing.  It's just, is it true?  Is it true? 
[00:13:00]  I go, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  And then he goes, I go, yeah, it's true.  And he goes, well, no one takes time off during the spring book.  No one, including morning guys.  Especially two weeks.  No one does that.  We have a problem.  And we need to talk right after the XM show today.  I go, look, man.  Anthony booked a cruise with his entire family that live all over the country.  He booked it a year ago. 
[00:13:30]  I go, this is a bigger problem.  No one is commuting, uh, communicating.  Yeah.  No one is communicating.  How many, you know what?  The listeners knew.  The listeners knew about this.  I think you booked.  Before management does?  I think you booked the trip before, uh, we even got back on regular radio.  Yeah.  Because over at XM, there's no spring books and fall books and summer books and winter books.  It's just whatever they do to figure out who's listening. 
[00:14:00]  Who knows?  I don't even want to know.  I think they got a clipboard and a pen and they're just checking if they see antennas on  the cars as they're going through tollboots.  I think that's their ratings.  There's one.  Write it down.  So beyond rude, beyond just in my face.  I'm like, hey, man, you know, I haven't even booked anything.  But first of all, yeah, call me.  I go, why don't you call?  And that's what I said.  I go, look, I'm not the one going away. 
[00:14:30]  Why aren't you calling Anthony?  Yeah.  And he didn't call you, obviously.  He goes, I figured I'd call you and we'll, and I guess we'll talk after the XM show.  And he goes, I hope he goes, I hope we can work this out.  Oh, oh my God.  Oh, well, hope of working things out.  Great.  No means there's hope.  There's, there's a chance of not working this out.  No.  It was that I hope as in, you know, I hope you're smart enough to see how serious I 
[00:15:00]  am about this phone call.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Same guys though.  Hey!  Hey!  Order whatever you want.  What do you think?  We've been born yesterday.  We know this crap.  Seen this before.  Oh, boy.  So then I had to call Anthony last night and give him the fine news.  So I'm just in a...  I'm in a funk right now. 
[00:15:30]  And we're not...  Oh, am I in a funk?  And obviously, we're not looking for sympathy.  Ant's not looking for sympathy.  Are you kidding?  But this is the deal.  It was something that you booked a really long time ago.  And they're just finding out about it now?  If anyone tries to see this as trying to get sympathy instead of just being honest, getting  on the air and telling our listeners what's going on, I swear, please come down here.  I want to shoot you in the head.  Who could possibly interpret it that way? 
[00:16:00]  It's just...  This is what's happening.  Here, we're telling you what's happening.  I am just disgusted.  A year in the planning, this thing.  A year in the planning.  Probably the last of these family cruise things.  The last one.  This is it.  It's a big one.  Usually, we only take a week.  It's a big one.  Going around the Panama Canal and everything.  It's a two-weeker because you want to go... 
[00:16:30]  It's a two-week.  It's going to be a big one.  Yeah, there you go.  A little family and big thing and, you know...  And it's just so effed up because the faithful listeners know that we had to take three days  off to go to Vegas to talk in front of, I don't know, who those people were for five  minutes.  I don't know what that was.  Yeah, but that was for five minutes.  For a five-minute conversation with a room full of nerds.  But that's okay for some reason.  We took three days off, but for some reason, that's okay. 
[00:17:00]  Well, we weren't in a book, they would say.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I would argue that point, no problem.  There you go.  No problem.  There we go.  Oh, God.  So here we are, sitting again with some just weird issue.  With the dark cloud over our heads.  The weird issue.  And sitting here doing a show with a meeting after the show.  That's wonderful.  Oh, is this a treat. 
[00:17:30]  I love the meetings when they're just good meetings.  Just sitting there.  Oh, do I adore a good meeting.  But now this one, knowing we're just going to walk into a firing squad like that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  Not fun.  By the way, I'm doing okay.  Huh?  Oh.  I'm doing okay, by the way.  Just in case anyone was asking?  Just in case you wanted to ask.  I'm doing just fine.  You're not right.  I'll be fine. 
[00:18:00]  In the end, I'll be just fine.  No problem here.  So then I called John Minnelli.  Then I'm fishing everybody out last night.  Trying to see where this is coming from.  Yeah, doing a little investigative reporting.  Well, I'm just like, you know, I'm like, when are we going to get help from the company  to help the radio show?  You know, a few bus ads and a few commercials were all nice.  Hunky-dory when we first came on board. 
[00:18:30]  But what about the just radio 101 stuff?  Like, I don't know.  The company that we work for has the Super Bowl.  And we did nothing for the Super Bowl.  Yeah, tickets would have been good.  Tickets to give away.  A big, huge TV to give away to watch the Super Bowl.  Maybe we go down there and broadcast.  Maybe we send someone from their staff down and broadcast.  They had free reigns.  It was their Super Bowl, basically.  CBS had the Super Bowl, not the NFL.  Well, it's the NFL's thing, whatever. 
[00:19:00]  But it's CBS.  Yeah, it could have sent some people.  And I'm like, don't you see a problem here?  Do we even have a prize closet?  Do we have the basics that every radio show needs?  If somebody calls.  Cool things to give away.  And exciting things to talk about where the marketing team might be.  I hear they're out.  They keep saying they're out giving out wow stickers.  I'm like, great.  What else are they doing?  What else are they doing? 
[00:19:30]  Where is the prize closet?  And then I got nowhere and I'm like, you know what?  I got to go eat.  I'm annoyed.  And I just gave up.  Which is not a good thing, by the way.  You don't want me giving up.  It's barely.  What, the prize closet?  Really?  Do they have one?  They have a prize closet?  What kind of stuff's in there?  Yeah.  I think some old CDs from like 2000.  When this station used to be rock, there's a few CDs in there. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  That's about it.  Can we go into the prize closet?  I want to see exactly what we have.  I'll find out if we can.  This is New York City.  We broadcast from New York City.  We should have a prize closet.  You can't even close the door.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, help me close the door and get a lock on this thing.  You try to shut it.  I'm going to kick in this big screen TV that's hanging out.  And you get up top there because there seems to be some kind of big wad of cash falling out. 
[00:20:30]  Just shut the door.  Okay, look.  Open the door real quick.  And I'll thrust my hands in and push that car in.  And you shut it.  Look, I don't want to sound stupid today.  It's not one thing that's going to make everything better.  No.  There's a lot of little things that need to happen to make this show successful, to make this radio station successful, to make this format successful.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  It doesn't help that we have to follow that crap show from L.A. before we're on.  Probably the worst radio show I've ever heard.  I know.  And the reason it's on before us is because they're just trying to save stupid money.  Hire a homeless guy for New York City and have them sit in front of a mic for six hours.  I'd listen to that.  It might be the new morning show.  But it's all these little things that need to happen.  You've got to take pride in what you're doing as a station. 
[00:21:30]  You've got to get a marketing team.  You've got to get prizes.  You've got to loosen the chains as far as how we speak on this type of show.  It's like one of those sim games.  It's like Radio Station Tycoon.  You've got to get everything.  If you wrench down a little too much on something, it's going to make a problem somewhere.  Right.  You've got to balance everything.  It's all this balancing act that you've got to do.  And it's things like you've got the Super Bowl. 
[00:22:00]  How about some giveaways?  How about a prize closet?  How about relaxing some of these dumb rules so we can actually do what we know how to do?  See, they hired us and they thought that was good enough to save the whole radio division.  It's not good enough.  We're saying it today.  It's not good enough.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  We presented lots of ideas that just get knocked down.  So, you know, we do the best we can with what we have. 
[00:22:30]  But everyone knows the show we do and the show we want to do and the show that is successful that we do.  By the way, if the ratings were up in some of these other cities, I would have never got that phone call yesterday.  Wouldn't have been an issue.  Have fun!  Give me back a souvenir, will you?  Yeah, you have a good time there.  But then the ratings go down.  Oh, what are you doing?  Hey! 
[00:23:00]  Hey!  Hey!  It's all horse crap.  Great meeting.  Hope we can work this out.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  Just wonderful.  That didn't take long.  And it might as well have been a hang-up after that.  It might as well have been a hang-up.  Just fantastic.  Couldn't be better.  Son of a bitch.  Is it true you're taking two weeks off in May? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  It's been true for a year.  It's been true for a year, and you probably should have known months ago.  Yeah.  And if you were communicating with XM when we came aboard, maybe these are the basic crap you could have found out very early on.  I know how long ago they were informed of this because I told Ben the days.  I remember telling Ben that I'm taking vacation. 
[00:24:00]  And here are the dates.  Everyone knows.  That's how long ago that was.  Jesus Christ.  Over at XM.  Over at XM.  Well, they're not communicating.  No.  So, you know, that'll work.  That'll work in the end.  Not communicating.  All right.  We got a lot to do today. 
[00:24:30]  Yes, enough of that.  Horse crap.  I'll wait to laugh at the show.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Yeah, sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Jimmy's Tain from Syracuse.  Boring.  What do you say, Al?  Jimmy's Tain from Syracuse just writing,  Boring.  Boring.  Sorry.  How stupid are you to still have the channel on this station? 
[00:25:00]  You're a dummy.  How would you, wouldn't that be great if that douche went in and was mad at something  and just started conveying how angry he was to maybe a coworker or a friend or something  and his friend just went,  Boring!  in his face.  This isn't,  I'm sorry, this isn't supposed to be some kind of bit or anything.  When things happen on this program,  we just talk about them.  Behind the scenes,  things happen.  You want, 
[00:25:30]  you want hacky radio?  Tune in earlier.  Tune in before this show.  You'll love that program if that's what you're looking for.  It's not on in all the markets.  Oh, what a shame.  Because some of the stations we're on are smart enough not to carry a dump show like  that.  What a shame.  Boring.  Yeah.  Jimmy's taint.  Boring!  Change the dial, ass.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O.N.A. Uncut and live. 
[00:26:00]  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  O.P. and Anthony!  Ah, you're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, if you have something, 1-866-313-FREE.  We're kind of talking about the snow that's coming toward New York City. 
[00:26:30]  The Northeast.  No big deal.  They're actually interviewing a dude that's in front of like a big mound of salt.  Yeah.  Oh, the news just stinks.  And they're showing plows.  Like they do every year.  And we're also noticing that the weather douche.  Yeah.  He's adjusting his forecast a little bit.  Yeah, the lines of where the 1-3 and the 6-8 are, it's kind of moving further away from the area. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  So the 1-3 is more of our area now.  The weather, they start by making it look like it's going to be a complete disaster to get you watching, get you talking.  Yeah.  And then as the days go on, they slowly move where this disaster snow is going to be until it's completely out of the viewing area.  Yeah, they know beforehand.  They just want you to watch.  There's no big news. 
[00:27:30]  So they got to take it up with some kind of weather thing.  So if there's even an inkling of a storm somewhere that might hit our area, they know in advance that it's not going to.  And conveniently, they do a story about Oswego just before they do the local forecast.  Yes, yes, to kind of tie it in and make it seem like it could be this worth, this bad.  It could be 10 feet of snow.  Because they do believe most of the people watching the news are just a bunch of dummies.  So if they see 10 to 12 feet of snow, some fine footage from Oswego, and then go into a quick local weather report, you're going to get confused at home and go, 
[00:28:00]  That's going to happen to us.  That's coming here?  I need to go get some canned goods now.  And milk and eggs and bread.  Stock up like Little House on the Prairie people.  And I'm hoping that Obama can be president.  Am I insane?  Of course I am.  People still prepare like it's 1820 when a storm comes.  And I'm hoping, stupid me, that Obama can be president in this country.  Thank God I brought my powdered milk.  Thank God I had powdered milk. 
[00:28:30]  When was the last time people really got snowed in in this city?  We got snowed in.  Even like any major, major city.  I understand Denver recently got a huge blizzard where the airport was closed down for a couple of days.  But it's not like it was years ago where when it snowed and you got like two feet of snow, your road didn't get plowed for days.  Yeah, they got it figured out in the year 2007. 
[00:29:00]  All you have to do is look at Buffalo.  They live with this crap every winter.  And it's not a real problem.  It's kind of a hassle.  They're used to it.  Yeah.  We had the most snow ever in Central Park, what, last year?  Yep.  Most snow ever.  And within three days.  And one snowfall.  It was business as usual.  And that was the most snow ever.  Yeah, the streets were all plowed.  When I think most snow ever, I'm thinking buildings collapsing, massive casualties.  Finding people dead in their houses from starvation because it's been weeks. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  That people haven't been able to get to them.  When the snow finally melts, it's just bodies everywhere.  Oh, my God.  Should I help?  I don't know.  Bodies.  You look at the equipment the city has now.  They pick up the snow with bulldozers, put them in these melters, and then the snow melts inside these things and goes to water and it pours into the river.  No, it's amazing.  Times Square.  That's why Times Square, you don't see snow in Times Square when it snows.  They melt the snow and it's just like it is on any other day. 
[00:30:00]  I'm glad you're bringing that up.  Last year, when most snow ever, Times Square within a day, you couldn't even tell it ever snowed.  Yeah.  They clean that up fast because there's a lot of money that is being made down there.  Wait, melt it.  That's brilliant.  I never knew they did that.  Oh, yeah.  What's a melt it look like?  It looks like a big dump truck.  Oh, wow.  And then they just dump it in there and it's heated and it melts the snow and it just goes right into the river.  Once again, three-year-old Uncle Anthony a question. 
[00:30:30]  Does the snow hate being melted?  No.  Snow has no feelings.  The point is we have it figured out in the year 2007, but people will be at the grocery stores all day today preparing for this big nothing.  They'll talk to the people, too.  So what are you doing here today?  Well, I heard it was going to snow, so I'm here to get my bread and my milk and my eggs, and you're going to live on French toast for what?  Look, they adjusted again.  Now it's snow rain, snow sleet rain, snow sleet freezing rain. 
[00:31:00]  See, all that was just snow.  But see, now they're adding rain to the forecast and they're going to start moving this band of bad weather further, further, further north until, of course, it's Oswego again.  Dude, they're 100 to 200 miles is the all-snow line now.  Yeah.  They've moved it to about 100 miles away.  100 miles north of the city?  That's conservative, man.  I think that's – they're showing basically Binghamton, if you know where Binghamton is as far as New York City goes. 
[00:31:30]  So, yeah, that band of snow was right over New York City.  Now it's way up near Binghamton.  And we got this, like, purple-y colored band that means freezing rain for a minute and then sleet and rain.  By tomorrow, it's going to be a blue band.  Isn't it?  Of course it is.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, good morning, boys.  How you doing today?  All right, Sean.  I was watching the news this morning.  Same douche reporter with the same people buying shovels again. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  What's funny as a news program, why do they go out and get that shot?  Just use the footage from last year.  Last year.  Because someone will watch it and go, that's last year's shovel.  I know that's last year's shovel.  I already bought this year's bottle.  Pulling the wool over my eyes.  Tools.  Hey, what were we bitching about yesterday?  By the way, you know, we go in, like, trends here.  We go in – what's the word I'm looking for? 
[00:32:30]  We'll bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.  And then we won't bitch for a long time.  And then we'll bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.  Just think of us as your girlfriend with her period.  That's us.  We go through our phase, but then we're fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then we're nice to hang out with.  But then we'll get a little bitchy.  Right now, we're having our period.  Yeah.  Get Club Soda Kenny to go to the drugstore.  You know what I mean?  Have him get some tampons for us. 
[00:33:00]  It's a bit heavy this time around.  What do you say, Al?  Can we talk about that?  God forbid.  Kids might be listening.  God forbid we tell the kids why mommy's a complete ass a week out of the month.  Hey.  What happens?  Yesterday, we were talking about guests for the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yes.  Cool.  Right.  I want to throw this at Roland's head. 
[00:33:30]  Your Blackberry?  Yes.  Because I just got the latest guest that is being offered to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Let me guess.  Let me make this perfectly clear.  We're on 25 radio stations right now, and we're part of XM Satellite Radio.  We're one of the biggest channels on XM Satellite Radio.  We're heard all over the country, thanks to XM, all over Canada.  So you would think we would get some big names for this radio show.  Right.  The police reuniting.  Everybody wants to jump on that story for a day or two. 
[00:34:00]  We've had all the guys.  Well, two out of the three guys on our show.  The Grammys just happened.  Maybe we have a little Grammy angle.  Get one of those guys on our show, right?  And we bitched about this yesterday, that our guests stink.  The guests were offered.  We don't take.  We could sit here on a daily basis with someone in that chair right behind me that you could give a flying crap about.  And we did it.  And we did it for quite a while.  And you heard a lot of those. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  And we were doing a lot of those because we were promised other things if we did those interviews.  And then the other things never panned out.  Yeah.  You know, the A-listers.  Uh-huh.  If you talk to this D-lister and this C-lister and this nobody, we'll finally get you like Danny DeVito in studio.  We're like, okay, all right, we'll take the hit as long as down the road we get some top-of-the-line guys.  It's like a hot girl going, look, I'll bang you, but you've got to sleep with my fat friends first.  Yeah, here's my lineup of fat friends.  Take care of them. 
[00:35:00]  And then I'll be in to see you.  And the hot chick is never available.  Oh, so yesterday we just bitched about that, didn't we?  Yeah.  So I'm thinking if I'm the guy that's booking for the radio show, and I don't even know if we blame Roland directly or the company he works for.  I really don't know.  I don't know.  There's like nameless, faceless people over there.  We've never met.  But I'll tell you this much.  XM pays this company to get guests on our show. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  It's a pretty penny, too.  It's a lot of money.  A pretty penny?  It's a pretty penny.  That's right.  All right, Mr. 1914.  So they have a job to do.  It's not like they're doing us a favor.  XM writes a big check every month to book this show.  So I'm thinking after we bitched and complained yesterday and pretty much showed everyone we're not really happy about it, that maybe the first guest offered since then would be something where we would like raise our eyebrows and go, hey. 
[00:36:00]  Hey.  Hey, this is a little interesting.  That would be a nice guest to have on the show.  This is – wow.  Who saw this coming?  So who could it be?  I'm so curious now.  Is it De Niro or Walker?  Because I've been asking about those guys.  Yeah, that would be good.  Well, it's –  Probably De Niro.  And nothing against this guy because he does a terrific job.  He really does.  Actually, I like both these guys.  We're being offered Kenny Mayne. 
[00:36:30]  Kenny Mayne.  And Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, who we've probably –  Talked to him on the phone numerous times.  And he gives us interesting radio.  And I'm sure we could, you know, we could get five or ten minutes out of him if we wanted to.  But we already know Mark.  And Kenny Mayne.  Yeah.  Kenny Mayne, of course, you know, he's a sports guy.  He's a sports guy.  And Thad pointed out – thank you, Thad.  This is the worst time of year to talk about sports. 
[00:37:00]  The worst.  After the Super Bowl, for about a month, it is boring in sports.  Nothing going on.  Hockey is kind of doing their thing.  It's not close enough to the playoffs yet.  The NBA, the same story.  Football, they had the Pro Bowl.  You know what is happening in baseball?  Pitchers and catchers.  They're talking about spring training.  Well, just the pitchers and catchers.  Yeah, yeah, just pitchers and catchers.  Are down there in Florida.  Sexy.  What the hell are we going to talk to Kenny Mayne about this time of year? 
[00:37:30]  There was a reason they came out with the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.  Because this time of year, there's no sports to really talk about.  And they had a magazine to sell.  And that's where the idea came from.  Like, hey, why don't we get girls in bikinis and we'll sell that issue?  Really?  That's how that?  Oh, yeah.  Because they realized that their circulation dropped drastically down this month.  Because there's no real excitement right now.  So someone who was brilliant got the idea to get a swimsuit issue together. 
[00:38:00]  To get people to buy the magazine.  I think people still buy the swimsuit issue and think it's sexy.  Boy, that's sexy.  It's worth a peek every year.  All right.  I like it.  I like my women with some clothes, Jimmy.  Look at her trunks.  Oh, boy.  Who's calling me?  Huh?  Should I take it?  Yeah, of course.  It's blocked.  Hello?  Hello?  Too late.  Too late?  I let it ring too long.  Anyway, so we're being offered Kenny Mayne and Mark Cuban. 
[00:38:30]  So you're mad because we're probably being offered them both at the same time and we have to make this tough decision.  So glad people listened to us.  That just throws his blackberry.  I'm so glad people are paying attention and maybe trying to help us out.  Wait a minute.  I got a private call, too.  Huh?  At 647.  Uh-oh.  That's interesting.  I've got a private call.  Uh-oh.  Where's yours? 
[00:39:00]  Do you also have an ad in the men's section of Craigslist?  Wouldn't that be a coincidence?  Oh, that was our out.  That's not the perfect guy for you.  That was our out.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  It's cool.  I showed the Norton clock.  50 minutes until I said something amusing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  The Norton clock.  That was odd.  All right.  I got to go check my phone now.  That we would both get a call like that?  Uh-oh.  I bet you got a call. 
[00:39:30]  Maybe we're getting fired.  Private?  I got to go check my phone.  No one fires you at 7 o'clock in the morning.  Oh, yeah?  Oh.  How long have you been on radio?  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony's Virus.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:40:00]  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show.  A little mellow Metallica to wake up to.  Maybe not so mellow.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-3.  Can we, uh, can we stop grieving this prostitute, please?  Can we stop?  What happened?  Apparently not.  I'm tired.  And Nicole, I don't care that she's dead.  Really?  No.  Yeah, who does? 
[00:40:30]  There's pictures of her sleeping with the Bahamian, whatever he is, Bahamas minister.  He's still, like, in bed with him or something.  No, man.  They're trying to make that picture more than it is, though.  That's what's pissing me off today.  You don't think he slept with her?  Huh?  You don't think he had sex with her?  I don't know if he had sex with her, but that picture is just an innocent picture.  Like, she decided to live in the Bahamas, and the guy obviously stopped by, and they're  trying to claim this proves that they had sex.  But there's a guy in the room just taking pictures, probably Howard K. Stern, taking pictures 
[00:41:00]  of Anna Nicole Smith in bed, because that's where she's spent the last ten years.  They're fully dressed.  They're fully dressed, and it's obvious the guy is, like, awkwardly, like, leaning into  the picture onto the bed, like, you know, trying to get a picture.  That's all it is.  You think this is one of those, he just walked in, hey, how's everything?  Something.  Take a picture with me.  And then, oh, Anna's in the bedroom, watches him go say hi.  He goes in, and everyone else follows.  Oh, make a great picture.  Yeah, then he gets on the bed and leans into the camera, and, you know, the stupid, I hate 
[00:41:30]  the news.  I know we spend a lot of time saying that on this show, but I really do, because now they're  all saying, well, this proves, look, look at these, look at these racy, spicy pictures.  Yeah.  It's an awkward picture.  The guy's obviously leaning in.  Yeah, she probably grabbed him, like, leaning in to take a picture, and she, come in, lay down  with me.  That's the latest on the Anna Nicole Smith thing.  These pictures are in every paper today. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, do you see my point, Jimmy?  It doesn't mean she didn't have sex with the guy.  I have no idea.  I just don't like the fact that he really looks like Idi Amin.  Oh, my God, I know.  Yeah.  Well, we know whose baby it isn't.  No, that's for sure.  Yeah.  Because there was, right when I saw that picture yesterday, I'm like, oh, what is this,  another guy claiming to be the father?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, well.  Oh, he can't be.  There's not even a possibility here.  Well.  What is it, up to five guys?  Five guys?  You're not having fun with this story, how ridiculous it's getting? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, of course, man.  But she's just, it's now like real grief that people are feeling.  What a hure.  What a hure.  What a hure.  Like she was a.  But think about it.  Who's really grieving?  Although, like, John Travolta was on one of the entertainment shows last night saying  that he's bummed out that she's gone.  I'm like, what?  Why, was he using her as a beard?  She wasn't into Scientology, was she?  Here's the latest.  A former bodyguard.  Nothing to care about.  Who worked for Anna Nicole Smith said on Monday that it's possible he is the father of infant  Danny Lynn Smith. 
[00:43:00]  Alexander Dank.  Dank.  Who had worked as a bodyguard for Smith told the television news magazine Extra that he  had an affair with Smith and that it's possible he is the father.  This is just turning into a real comedy.  That's great.  There are so many people coming forward.  Please tell me Vegas is doing something with this.  Like Vegas odds.  Please tell me.  I don't think it's Howard K.  No.  I don't see him being the father. 
[00:43:30]  He's a cuckold.  He'd probably like to watch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know about this Zsa Zsa Gabor husband thing either.  He just seems like he wanted to throw his hat in the ring.  He's going to take a paternity test though.  That was the latest news on him.  Then the...  Oh, and backing up really fast, Howard K. Stern.  We all saw that interview where he's in tears.  They've been playing it all over TV.  Yeah.  He was paid a million dollars.  The insider slash entertainment tonight. 
[00:44:00]  It's the same show, but it's two shows.  Who could keep track?  But they gave him a million dollars for that exclusive crying interview.  Yeah.  So don't get all choked up when you see him all emotional.  A million bucks.  He got a million bucks.  That doesn't happen where a guy walks in.  He starts talking about this woman he loved and starts crying.  And the station goes, or the show goes, oh, look, hey, hey, here's a million.  Here's a million. 
[00:44:30]  That'll make you feel better.  Just spend it in good health.  That's something that's negotiated.  Lawyers are involved.  They tell their client.  Things go back and forth.  So then he gets on the show and, oh, oh, a million dollars.  Oh.  Well, the insider had the inside track.  Of course they did.  Because they were the only ones that gave a crap about this woman.  They were doing, like, interviews with her for the last year when the rest of the media is like, yeah, whatever.  Yeah, they had a bunch of clips.  Whatever.  But then she dies out of nowhere. 
[00:45:00]  And then all of a sudden the insider looks great because they've been, like, following her for the last year.  They got all the clips and all the dirt on her.  Yeah.  All the dirt on her.  You want to hear some of this dumb interview that he got a million dollars for?  Yeah, let's hear what a million bucks he'll buy.  You would think if you're going to do an exclusive interview with this guy and give him a million dollars,  you would think maybe you would get better audio.  You'd mic them?  Yeah, maybe you would mic them better.  Howard says Anna's mom will never get the baby. 
[00:45:30]  She's just as bad, too, in this soap opera.  I'm going to take my baby.  I'm going to take Anna's baby.  Never.  Never.  On the private flight to see Danny Lynn, Howard, still in deep emotional pain,  talked about his quest to keep her out of the hands of her grandmother, Virgie Arthur.  I got out of bed, so I'm going to make sure that Anna's wishes are carried out.  He sounds doped up. 
[00:46:00]  Doesn't he sound doped up?  He's whiny.  He's like, I'm going to make sure.  Eh, I'm the father.  Louie Anderson.  A million dollars for that.  Well, it goes on.  Damn it.  She just despised that woman.  Despised that woman.  As long as I have one breath left in my body, that woman will not see the end of it.  Talking about Anna Nicole Smith's mom, obviously. 
[00:46:30]  And then the clips go on.  You got him talking about how they were planning a real wedding.  Howard and Anna Nicole Smith.  And he talks about appreciating his friends in the Bahamas.  Just a bunch of blah, blah, blah.  But he got a million dollars for that.  How good of a relationship could they have had if there's five possible fathers to a kid who's less than a year old?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, how close could they be?  What kind of great relationship did they have?  Did you watch the Anna Nicole Smith reality show?  It was the best train wreck TV show ever, way before Danny Bonaduce. 
[00:47:00]  It was unbelievable.  And he was obviously just like a friend that she would just kind of like, oh, Howard.  Like she knew that he was deeply in love.  Oh, Howard.  Deeply in love with her.  And she didn't want anything to do with that guy.  But obviously, for whatever reason, she made him the baby's father.  Put him on the birth certificate or something?  I would be surprised if they even had sex ever. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, he seems like one of those kind of whiny, like just hanging around her to kind of get some, be part of the in crowd.  And hope that maybe he could get a piece.  Yeah.  But then he's just got to stand there and watch other guys doing her.  Watching as everyone else is banging her.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, we don't know for sure.  I want to keep it safe.  Don't want to slander anyone.  There's pictures of her and Charles Dutton in the paper today. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Charles Dutton.  I think it's safe to say that she had a lot of sex.  Are we allowed to say that today?  Or is that too crazy, too edgy?  Yeah, I think she did.  In my personal opinion.  Yeah.  In my humble opinion.  And then you guys were talking about, sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know about him either.  Although, you know, who knows?  Well, there's a great little piece in the paper today.  Cindy Adams, who I'm surprised she's still alive and writing, but she is. 
[00:48:30]  In the New York Post, she continues to do her little column.  And we're learning a lot about Zsa Zsa Gabor this morning.  Last Zsa Zsa was really in the news was years ago when she slapped that cop, right?  That was Zsa Zsa, not her sister, right?  Ava.  Her sister had the class, right?  Ava was the one that, wasn't she on Green Acres?  It was Zsa Zsa.  Now, Ava, good boy.  Ava was Green Acres, and she was the one that was kind of a little more in control.  Yeah.  And Zsa Zsa was the out of control one. 
[00:49:00]  Ava dead, I do believe.  Mm-hmm.  And Zsa Zsa's still kicking.  Yeah, barely.  We were wondering how old she was.  Turns out she's how old?  We found out yesterday she's going to be 90 this year.  90.  And this prince dude, self-made prince dude, kind of like making yourself a king of something.  How could you be a self-made prince?  It's a title.  You can't just, it's like saying I'm the president.  Just, of what?  You know how old Zsa Zsa Gabor is? 
[00:49:30]  Her sister, Ava, died like 12 years ago.  Ooh.  So the prince is 59.  Right.  And it's like her eighth husband or something like that, and she's 90.  Of course, darling.  Enough with the darling.  What a C she must be.  Darling.  You guys want to learn about Zsa Zsa today really fast?  Certainly.  All right.  But Cindy Adams writes, I've spent years all over the world with Zsa Zsa Gabor.  Have you?  In those days, this blonde confection, hair like a cloud, was one of the most glamorous 
[00:50:00]  figures of the day.  Hair like a cloud?  What?  That's that old lady, like, bouffant, hairspray, puffy, cotton candy head.  Nothing natural about it.  Hair like a cloud and a brain to match.  What's classy about her, though?  She couldn't make a marriage work.  She was just an old hose bag.  You're a Hungarian whore.  This gets really good.  Jimmy's going to love this.  Wife of a Hilton.  Lover of a Playboy.  Was she wife of a Hilton?  I guess so, yeah.  Inventor of outrageous sayings like, to be sure you can keep your man home, shoot him 
[00:50:30]  in the legs.  Ah, she's out of her mind, that one.  Shasha has a pistol in her day.  You got to take your nap after her.  Of course.  And if you break up with your fiance, always send back the ring, but keep the stone.  Did Cindy Adams just sound worse, quotes?  Shasha's an ass.  She once said, if you want salad, ask the waiter. 
[00:51:00]  So you want to know what Shasha's all about today?  You ready for this?  Yeah, let's see what this, uh, this pistol.  I need bank one.  She sure sounded, uh, full of life and vim and vigor.  Oh, yeah.  She certainly is.  Vigor, Jimmy.  I didn't, I said vim and vigor.  Yeah.  Oh.  Today, Zsa Zsa exists as a prisoner in her Bel Air mansion.  A prisoner?  What happened?  She could sit. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, she could stand.  But she remains cloistered in her room.  In bed.  In bed?  Oh.  Because I'm sitting there like, why is this prince having a press conference just casually  talking about how he had an affair with Ann Nicole Smith for 10 years?  Yeah, isn't his wife going to be mad?  And I'm thinking, because no one has thought of Jar Jar Gabor in at least a decade, you're  thinking, oh, man, she's going to be pissed and kick him out of the house or something.  She's slapping cops.  She's going to smack this guy silly. 
[00:52:00]  She doesn't even know where she is at this point.  She sees no one.  Goes nowhere.  She watches TV.  She watched the clownish performance of her husband of 20 years.  Announced he might have been on the conga line that could have fathered Ann Nicole's baby.  How does she know she watched this if she doesn't see anybody?  I guess she has a personal relationship with Jar Jar Gabor.  I think she's full of crap, too.  She's got a personal relationship with Jesus. 
[00:52:30]  Jesus.  Please.  Friends swear he's never, never, ever, never mentioned Anna to anyone.  Of course not.  No.  That's what guys do when they have affairs.  They don't talk about it.  Ixnay.  Ixnay on the fact, eh, that I'm banging, eh.  The hot secretary, eh.  That's some great pig Latin.  I stink.  Uh, Jar Jar's body is impaired.  Her mind, not.  She is devastated. 
[00:53:00]  Thank God.  He would try to claim paternity of Anna Nicole Smith's child.  If those two desperate for limelight beings ever, ever hooked up, it would not be between  their bodies.  Hmm.  What?  The link would be what the other might do for them.  For them, not to them.  She would bring media attention.  Something nobody else on this planet seems interested in giving him.  I know firsthand he's tried to sell a book on his life with Jar Jar.  He would give Anna a title. 
[00:53:30]  Something besides train wreck.  He himself has the title of prince.  You get that by inheriting it, marrying it, or in some European market, buying it.  It's for grabs.  Jar Jar in those old days would order him a bout.  I was in that house when she told him, go upstairs and put on your blue blazer and gray pants.  Ah.  He obediently trotted upstairs and put on his blue blazer and gray pants.  Blue blazer and gray pants. 
[00:54:00]  You know, maybe this prince had it and said, you know what?  Yeah.  You old bag.  Enough of this bat.  Young.  Ooh.  Now they're laying in bed with legs that probably look like veiny linguine just sitting there.  Oh, imagine what that devastated body looks like.  90 years old.  She hasn't left bed.  How it smells in that house.  Oh.  And I go, ah, pardon me, darling.  He was 39.  She was 70 when they got married.  Nice.  20 years.  39 and 70.  39 and 70. 
[00:54:30]  What's that about?  You think they consummated that marriage?  Hopefully, once she was asleep.  Come on, darling.  What are you waiting for, darling?  All some bats flying across the room.  I'm a prince.  There you go.  You've been knighted, whore.  You lift the covers after they're done, and it looks like when a building is collapsed 
[00:55:00]  by a demolition team, that duck comes out of the blanket.  Well, guys, now he's in charge.  When he leaves, he padlocks the mansion's gates.  Good.  Maybe he doesn't want any.  Yeah, right?  It is Zha Zha, after all.  She was pretty damn famous in her day.  What kind of valuable jewelry that he's going to get after she drops?  He alone has the key.  The gate phone is disconnected, so she doesn't know if anyone even has tried to visit. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, yeah, people are just clamoring to visit with this devastated sack of bones.  Her longtime maid is gone.  Well, there's no more work to do.  What are you doing?  She stays in bed.  He monitors her phone calls.  Whether their prenup was since torn up, who knows?  Torn up.  That's Cindy Adams today.  Wow.  She said, I'm a marvelous housekeeper.  Every time I marry a man, I keep his house.  Oh, she's a motherless housekeeper. 
[00:56:00]  Every time I marry a man, I keep his house.  Keeps his house.  That's great.  Good.  I'm glad you lay in there, and I'm glad your mind is sharp as a tack.  I'd hate to think she was, you know, crazy and didn't know that her body was just wasted away.  All right, here we go.  We found...  Is this the quotes?  You guys want more Zsa Zsa Gabor quotes?  Oh, yeah, please.  Saucy.  To be loved is a strength.  To love is a weakness. 
[00:56:30]  She's profound.  What is it to be a C?  Yeah.  God almighty.  She's been a professional C her entire life.  A man in love is incomplete until he is married.  Then he's finished.  A man in love is incomplete.  As a woman, you have to choose between your fanny or your face.  I chose my face.  Her fanny.  Fish.  How old are you?  I'm just going to refer to an ass now as a fanny. 
[00:57:00]  I'm changing the way I speak.  Fanny.  The husband gave her a choice.  The fanny or the face?  She had to make a quick decision.  Well, they look the same.  Geez.  At this point, who could tell the difference?  Darling, I don't want that in either place.  You have two choices.  You said it, whore.  I got your quote right here.  Your fanny or your face.  Hey, I was starting to like this prince all of a sudden. 
[00:57:30]  I thought he was a douche.  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore.  You got two choices.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  Uh, I have never hated a man enough to give his diamonds back.  She also said, when asked how many husbands she had, Zsa Zsa replied, you mean, other than  my own?  You'll do what I want you to do, your own slut.  You hear that?  Yeah.  When a husband she had, Zsa Zsa replied, other than my own.  Oh, she's talking about Keith.  There's a girl, man, Rob, there. 
[00:58:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Macho.  Macho.  Husbands are like fires.  They go out if unattended.  Well, whoops.  Yeah.  Well, she is quite knowledgeable.  Whoops.  Fannies are like faces, and in the last 20 years, nothing has been wiped off either.  That was a rotten old corpse.  Oh, God.  Imagine what that fanny looks like.  Oh, it's awful.  Like it's been thrown through a fanny.  It probably looks like a beanbag chair that has no air or stuffing in it. 
[00:58:30]  Like when you roll it over, it's just kind of flat and soft.  Old doily ass.  A girl must marry for love and keep on marrying until she finds it.  Never complain, never explain, was another quote.  That was her.  I want a man who's kind and understanding.  Is that too much to ask of a millionaire?  Ah, she got what she said.  Are you still reading quotes?  Yeah, it's pretty funny, actually.  That was just Opie talking.  She got what she deserved.  She had a couple of funny quotes, though. 
[00:59:00]  I got to credit.  That's pretty funny.  Not bad.  Did you have a writer?  Probably.  Yeah.  Some old guy, Saul.  Old socialite.  Around the house.  I always said marriage should be a 50-50 proposition.  He should be at least 50 years old and have at least $50 million.  When in trouble, take a bath and wash your hair.  When in trouble.  She could actually go right down the drain right now in the toilet.  Her skin and bones are such mush.  Oh, darling, help me. 
[00:59:30]  You just see her like up to the thighs is like down the drain.  Her whole Play-Doh bones.  That's like the old lady from The Shining at this point.  She's just awful.  Do you know she was 50, 40 years ago?  Wow.  Do you know how old she is?  How old is she?  50, 40 years ago.  You know, you feel a little old when you celebrate your 50th.  You feel like that was a milestone.  She was 50.  What is it?  She was huge like 40 years ago.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Like as a sex pot.  I guess.  She was 50.  Let's say hi to Mongo the Trucker.  Mongo.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  Do you think the prince noodled her bippy?  Franco.  Hey, they're asking for the CSI clip, Anthony.  You got it?  Oh, yes.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  Let's.  Well, thanks, E-Rock.  Way to pay attention to what's going on with the show.  I will go over there and smack your headphones off.  Just do it anyway. 
[01:00:30]  Let's see.  I've ever hated enough to give his dines back.  Samus, she had John replied, you mean other than my own?  I love this bitch.  Tone of happy.  Tone of happy. 
[01:01:00]  That's terrible. 
[01:01:30]  I'm sorry.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:02:00]  Who's the baby's father?  Snow is on the way.  The police reuniting.  I didn't realize how fat she got me.  I just saw old footage.  What a porker.  Oh, yeah.  She was giant.  I like her more now.  Of course, she did that trim spa thing.  Cool.  Giant.  She was a fat pig.  Made a lot of money for trim spa because people were like, what? 
[01:02:30]  Yep.  She looks like what now?  Little do they know, there might have been something else helping the loss of the weight.  It could have been.  That fridge, methadone, Worcestershire sauce, yogurt.  When she walked out of the bathroom, it must have been like a nuclear weapon.  No blockage there, huh?  No.  It's close to the right behind her.  People in the living room would go, what is that?  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[01:03:00]  1-866-313-FREE.  Got to do it really fast.  That's quick.  Now, that makes it sound like I don't want to do this.  But I do want to do this.  Yeah.  That was brought to my attention.  Oh, right.  People get what I'm talking about.  Just conversation.  When you say we got to do something, it makes it sound like you really don't want to do it.  Does it?  Oh, you got to go to a meeting after work. 
[01:03:30]  Now, that makes it sound like I don't want to do it, and I don't.  All right.  Do you guys use the 1-800-PRO-FLOWERS?  I just use them online.  I'll pay for it.  I don't want to.  You did?  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want any favors?  No, I don't care.  No favors?  You don't want any favors from these phonies?  These phony balonies?  And that way you see how it really works.  I'm sure it's good.  I just don't know what to write on a card ever because you get to write it on a card on a computer.  What do you put?  Did you put?  Because Valentine's Day is tomorrow. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Did you put, I love you?  No, I put, thanks for effing me.  Please tell me that's what you're right.  No, I couldn't.  If I thought it would go through, I would, believe me.  If I thought that they would keep it.  Dude, I get whacked because Valentine's Day is tomorrow and then her birthday is in five days.  You don't get whacked.  Why?  You spend less money.  You think?  Yeah.  Not this early in the relationship.  But you spend less money.  Over the years, you'll spend less money if, you know, this is going to be a long-term thing. 
[01:04:30]  Over the years.  Buy her a bridge gift, like one thing, give it like the 17th in between the two days.  There you go.  You'll do a little less for Valentine's Day knowing you have the birthday.  I'm telling you.  You save money in the end.  Is that?  I've known people that have been with, well, ah, it's, ah, whatever.  I don't want to blow up somebody's spot.  But, you know, they get screwed in the end.  When you have a birthday very close to a major holiday. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  In the end, you save money.  Because it's not as special, maybe, because there's the other thing going on, so there's  like two things.  Yeah.  I don't know what to put.  Yeah, I put I love you, of course.  Aw.  Aw, but you don't know what to put before that.  Dear, sweetie, baby, dear, not dear.  Not dear baby, no.  Just baby.  Is it baby blank?  Sometimes you do a baby doll or a baby.  No, it's a real baby. 
[01:05:30]  Baby needs changing.  So you're putting baby, uh, uh, so how long have you been together, technically?  We started seeing each other a couple of months.  Though it has only been a couple of months.  It seems like forever, you see.  I love you, Jim.  Imagine just putting the most heinous Valentine's Day card, and not to somebody that has a sense 
[01:06:00]  of humor that would get it, but just really to one of these, like, housewives that just  don't have that type of sense of humor, and just put that, it seems like it's been a lifetime  with you, you see.  Let's blow up everyone's...  Oh my God, what is he doing?  I should send one to my mother, from my father.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't do that. 
[01:06:30]  That's what I was getting at.  We should get all our O&A pass to just send out cards.  Oh, is that great?  Sign it, from me.  Because we're not going to be able to figure out what their real names are, so just write,  from me.  From me.  I'm sending in this card today, because I have to.  From me.  From me.  How funny would that be?  Just a mass mailing of Valentine's Day cards. 
[01:07:00]  Wait for me in the bedroom.  I didn't include a vase.  You know where I want to stick these.  Thanks for nothing.  But you wrote something on the card?  Just one line.  Just one quick line.  Yeah, because I mean, we say nice things to each other.  I'm always like, hey, you know, you're nice.  You're nice.  Are you going out?  Are you doing anything?  I don't know if we are tomorrow. 
[01:07:30]  I know for the birthday we're going out to dinner.  Yeah.  I don't think we made plans for tomorrow.  Yeah.  Going out on Valentine's Day is ridiculous.  Yeah, plus some things.  So you've got to go like the night before or after.  She told me this weekend I went to a gig, so we'll hang out.  We'll go very early.  Take a horse ride.  Have a brunch.  She loves brunch.  I hate it.  I did a brunch last year.  It worked out perfect.  Brunch stinks unless you drink.  Yeah.  When you're drinking, brunch is the best thing.  Used to do brunch in Huntington.  Yeah?  Right kind of near F.H. Riley's over there in Huntington. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  My brother's restaurant, 400 New York Avenue?  Yeah.  Yeah?  It was right there.  It was a place for brunch, and the actual food bill was something like 40 bucks for like  four people, and the booze bill was $380, and this was Sunday morning.  Yeah.  Ooh.  The Bloody Marys. 
[01:08:30]  He had a drink because he was miserable.  True.  Oh, did I ever.  No, he drinks to have fun.  Yeah, this is great brunch, you piece of crap.  Give me another mimosa.  I'd like to have a mimosa tree with you wrapped around it.  It's an actual tree.  She was just a shrew, huh?  Oh.  Oh, boy. 
[01:09:00]  What?  Oh.  I mean.  God.  I can't.  You know when people say, you know, usually over time, you only remember the good times.  You barely remember those bad times, so it makes, like, nostalgia seem, you know, you  get nostalgic about things.  And it makes old times seem better than they were because you're only remembering the good  and not the bad.  I cannot remember good.  I have no recollection of any real good times. 
[01:09:30]  But you were married for 10 years.  10 years.  Not nine years.  Nine years.  And I don't really remember, I remember having good times when I wasn't with her, like,  like during those nine years, like hanging out with friends, doing the show, things like  that.  But I don't remember actually sitting down and having one good time.  Not one.  No, that's just it.  I'm trying to find one. 
[01:10:00]  Would you be sad if she died?  I will be a thousand percent honest with you.  No, I would not be sad.  I don't wish death on anybody.  That's an awful thing to carry around with you.  You know, so I wouldn't do that, honestly.  But if God forbid something were to happen, I wouldn't be sad about it.  I wouldn't be sad.  Would you cry?  No, I wouldn't go to the funeral.  I wouldn't do anything.  She's nothing to me. 
[01:10:30]  How much time would you spend with the news?  With the news?  Of that particular news.  Of that event?  Yes.  We're on to something else.  What do you want to talk about?  What would your reaction be?  Hmm.  Yeah, let's see.  You'd probably know first.  Why would I know?  Because you'd probably get some kind of message from somebody that knows her, being in the  Huntington circles.  I don't know about that.  You might.  An old friend of hers.  I honestly don't know what she's been up to. 
[01:11:00]  No, no.  I know.  But if it's something like that, if she was up to death, you might get a phone call.  I'm trying to think.  It might be.  Maybe.  What about the ex, maybe?  No.  No?  No.  No.  No.  No.  I mean, even under that extreme circumstance.  No.  No?  Well, she might then have someone call you.  Probably.  I don't know.  You'd probably find out.  Just because of the Huntington connection?  Yeah, the Huntington thing.  It's all right.  We find out.  You're in the bar business.  So, you know, they'd all go into mourning. 
[01:11:30]  They'd fly their flags at half-mast.  Half of them would be out of business.  Fly their taps at half-mast.  Their taps.  Going out of business.  We can pour beer and play taps at the same time.  Just see, bar for sale.  Bar for sale.  Sorry, guys.  Only half a beer for everybody today.  I'd find out.  Only pouring half beers.  Half beers today.  I'd go, I'd go, hmm, wow. 
[01:12:00]  How'd that happen?  Yeah.  And then I'd be curious as to how it happened.  And then I'd go, oh, well, I better stop the automatic payments.  Here's a question.  If you could choose, obviously you'd never do anything, but if you, in some grand scheme  in the universe, could choose how it would happen.  Like, say God came to you.  Choose how it would happen.  And said, this is your choice.  How would you want it to happen?  That's too much responsibility.  But like, if you had to.  For man.  For me.  For one man. 
[01:12:30]  Man.  I'd say, if you threw dice onto a bunch of different choices, what choice would you want  to have happen?  I'd like something ironic.  Oh, I'll answer.  I'll call on Greg.  On the way to the bank, trying to cash an alimony.  An alimony check?  Yeah.  Something ironic.  Yeah.  I would like something ironic.  Knowing my pal Anthony would have to be something ironic.  Something a little twisted and ironic.  Yeah.  Where you would have to go.  On the way.  That's kind of funny.  Yeah.  That's kind of funny. 
[01:13:00]  I didn't want to say it, but.  You don't want to look like a complete ass, so you'd be like, oh, that's kind of funny.  Yeah.  If you think about it.  Isn't that odd?  She was going there to.  You know, she didn't make to the bank.  Does that mean that that's hers?  Wait.  The bus she was on to go to the bank with the big check did what?  Wow.  That's kind of funny.  That's kind of funny and interesting.  So, what's new? 
[01:13:30]  Happy Valentine's Day, everyone.  Happy Valentine's Day.  I can't remember one good time.  I just don't.  That didn't involve, like, other people, and the good time was with the other people and drinking and, you know, hanging out, party and things like that.  This was just an incidental cancer.  Right.  An incidental cancer on the good time. 
[01:14:00]  A malignant tumor on the good time that could not be removed and still is there.  Isn't it nice to be in a happy and healthy relationship?  Yes.  Do you write romantic stuff on cards?  I can't picture you being romantic.  Me?  I think you'd be very lovey and dovey, but do you, like, actually sit down there when you write something?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Isn't it lovey-dovey?  I'm a writer.  How could you be lovey and dovey?  Could someone just be dovey?  Yes.  That's silly if you're just dovey without being lovey.  That's if you're kind of a faggot and you're like birds at the same time. 
[01:14:30]  You're just coo.  Yeah, you're just coo.  Coo.  I'm being dovey, honey.  Coo.  Coo.  And then I'm going to crapple over your patio.  You'll put up plastic owls to keep me away.  Coo.  How do you know the noise doves make?  I don't know.  I've shot a few in my day.  I used to go dove hunting in California, twist their little heads off, and skin them.  Aw.  So, wait, what did you write that's romantic?  What's something you'd write that's romantic, like that's nice? 
[01:15:00]  I'm not sharing.  Come on, something.  It doesn't have to be something you've written, but just something you could think of writing.  Something soft and sweet.  Mmm.  I'm trying to think of something that I actually didn't write.  What, that's something you wrote?  It's not bad.  No, no.  I'm a sap.  Sweet.  You've got to write, sweetie, comma, indent, and then just write what you feel. 
[01:15:30]  That's right.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  Well, maybe not those words.  Something with you complete me.  Aw.  That's a good one.  I wish I would have known that.  See, I didn't write that at all.  I wrote, thank God I was a complete person before I met you.  Thanks a lot.  I used to have a lot more fun before I met you.  That's true.  Dear baby.  Is it wrong? 
[01:16:00]  Baby.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How about baby, comma, thank you for saving me a fortune in hookers.  I don't think she'd like that.  All right.  You complete me.  That's good.  I should have thought of that.  Oh, Chris has a good one, I guess.  A good ironic way.  All right.  Let's go to Chris in Queens.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  How you doing, my friend?  And I just thought it'd be so ironic that your wife would get hit by an MTA bus with 
[01:16:30]  a big free FM billboard with you and Opie smiling.  Now, that would be interesting, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  That would be fantastic.  Crossing the street with that big check in her hand.  And here comes a bus with the big ONA sign on the side.  On Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Let's go to Shwuggy, Shwuggy.  Hey, guys. 
[01:17:00]  What's going on?  Hey, Shwuggy.  Hey, Ed.  After listening to you for all these years, I need to know, was your wife a looker?  A looker?  Was she good looking?  You never described what she looked like.  She was average.  I'll give her that.  You know.  I was a tin knocker.  What was I gunning for?  A supermodel?  I had no idea how you were going to answer that.  She was average.  Hey, Opie.  Just a question for you, man. 
[01:17:30]  You told the story about Sandy and Ant's ex.  Think those two were getting it on at all?  She pulled a carol on you from Friends?  I have no idea if those two even talk.  I have no clue.  Because you said they were very good friends and they kind of turned on you.  Well, that doesn't mean that people are involved in a lesbian relationship.  Jesus.  It just seemed, I don't know, they were on a cruise together.  I mean, come on.  I think that was more a way to get back at me.  That was a good one, too.  Gotta give her that.  Jesus.  God bless them if they're having fun with each other. 
[01:18:00]  Whatever.  Took my Amex card and went and took Opie's ex-girlfriend on a cruise.  How'd that happen?  By taking my Amex card and putting a...  Why didn't you refuse the charges?  I paid you back.  It was like done or something by the time I found out.  I felt so guilty.  I'm like, I had nothing to do with this, but here.  Yeah, O paid me back.  I was in my own hell.  I'm like, here.  His share of it.  But isn't that stealing? 
[01:18:30]  No, there's no stealing in that.  Oh, marriage, man.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  There's no stealing in marriage.  Stealing.  And a marriage gone wrong.  There's no stealing until it's final.  How much did it cost you, the whole vacation that you didn't want to...  I don't remember.  I blocked that out of my head.  Yeah, it was a few G's.  And that was after taking the 40 G's.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I know.  So it's awful.  A lot of G's.  I was going G's all the time.  G's.  G's.  All those G's.  G's. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, this is such a good day before Valentine's Day conversation.  Look, I'm getting all nostalgic.  I'm getting all misty.  My eyes are welling up and tearing, thinking about all the G's.  I love the fact you went, eh, she was average.  Eh, it was.  I didn't get it.  She was just average.  She was average.  She looked better at the beginning, you know, the whole thing.  Back in, like, I guess it was the late 80s, somewhere around there. 
[01:19:30]  And then it was just, you know, you could do a few shots too many.  And those...  God.  Where's my beep?  Where's my beep?  Because I can't even...  I can't even...  Those goddamn...  Nails.  Holy...  What the... 
[01:20:00]  Was she thinking?  About those...  Nails.  What do you mean?  They were so long, they started kind of, um...  Curving.  Dude.  Ew.  She had this friggin' obsession.  And I don't know if she still does or not.  With these nails, that would be as long...  Half the length of her fingers themselves.  Giant.  Claw-like.  He's not lying.  That you usually see on big, fat African-American women. 
[01:20:30]  I would go with two to three...  Two inches?  Huge.  Easily two inches.  Huge.  Did you think it was kind of cute?  No.  Never liked the nails.  Did you ever tell her?  Hated the nails.  Why would I want to invite that upon myself?  Why, Opie, would I invite that hell upon me?  Um, hey, you know something?  I was just...  Here's my opinion.  Why don't you sit down and have a shot?  I mean, let me, uh... 
[01:21:00]  I don't...  I've seen this, by the way.  And would always have to try to soften the beaches  before he had to say something that might be construed as controversial.  Unpleasant.  Unpleasant.  I know there was a phase back in the 80s at some point.  Let her drink a little bit.  All right.  Take a few more sips.  Now I've had my drink.  I know the 80s, at some point in the 80s,  it was kind of in to have long nails.  A lot of girls had, like, these talons for a while. 
[01:21:30]  It's now 1996.  Maybe you should cut them down a little.  You could still have, like, nails and go to the nail place  and, you know, have them done.  Get the manicure and everything and paint them and everything.  But maybe they could be a little shorter to...  Oh, short like your...  Is that how long you want them? 
[01:22:00]  As big as that excuse for a...  Now, look.  There's no need to get personal stuff.  It's just my opinion.  The people I see really don't wear nails like that anymore.  So, why don't you go f*** yourself?  I'll wear these...  Look, how about I chase you around the house  and go to scratch your eyes out with the f***ing nails? 
[01:22:30]  I hope this is funny for others.  Happy Valentine's Day, f***ing head.  Because I live this.  Wait.  Oh, with the nails.  So, she would never, like, really compare...  Like, make fun of your size, would she?  No, no.  I was kidding about that.  I know how that affects Jimmy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  You know, fast, the fun drained out of the room for me.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  No, no.  I just thought that would be the ultimate insult for a minute.  I don't even really remember the...  Wouldn't be insult...  She wouldn't really insult me as much as just get belligerent. 
[01:23:00]  And there wasn't...  If there was an insult, it would kind of be refreshing  because it would mean there was a thought process going on.  It was just these things like,  Yeah, why don't you go f*** yourself?  Why?  And then I'd try to be reasonable.  Logically, tell me...  Try to tell me why I should go f*** myself.  Because it just...  Like, why are you saying that?  I did nothing...  Ten minutes ago, everything was fine. 
[01:23:30]  Now, I should go f*** myself.  What happened in those ten minutes?  Ten minutes, five minutes, whatever it is.  You could go f*** every minute.  See, you're not making sense.  I'm not making sense.  F*** you.  You're not making f***ing sense.  What changed?  I really tried to get her to say,  what changed over ten minutes besides ten shots?  I don't mean to laugh so hard.  This is like...  He's...  Oh!  He's nailing this.  Like, you wouldn't believe.  And I've logically tried to explain... 
[01:24:00]  How many times did I...  Didn't work.  Never worked.  And I used to hang out a lot back in the day, and socially, how many times did I look at  you and go, what happened?  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  Everything was just...  Like, what happened?  I went to the bathroom so many times.  Like, I hope you go to the bathroom and come back.  I'm there.  I'm watching the same stuff.  I'm like, what happened?  Did you, like, sign something to her? 
[01:24:30]  I did nothing.  I did nothing.  And it would be just like, hi.  All of a sudden, I'm like, what happened?  I, uh...  Like Dr. Bellows.  You'd be like, Dr.  I, uh...  But just a second ago, and then...  But Major Nelson, I looked over here, and she was fine, and I came back, and...  Well, she's a belligerent.  What happened, Major?  But then I...  But...  I saw there was...  There was a woman there two seconds ago, and now she's telling you to go... 
[01:25:00]  ...yourself, like...  Major Nelson!  He's always so confused.  That was Opie.  What happened?  I...  I...  I came back.  I would be so confused.  Like, what could have possibly happened?  Oh.  Wow.  It just got brutal.  Much fun.  Happy Valentine's, everybody.  And if you're planning on getting engaged, a lot of people do that on Valentine's Day,  uh, congrats.  Congrats.  I was your pal back then.  We would drive together.  I've said this before. 
[01:25:30]  We would be pulling up to Ant's old crib, and I go, you want to take a ride around the  block?  And he goes...  Yeah, maybe we could stop off at the bar.  And then I'd go, so do I.  Yeah.  Little does the world know what's going on.  They think we're just rock stars.  So do I.  Oh.  It was miserable, huh?  I was so miserable.  It would be completely...  It was completely done.  Like, it was just... 
[01:26:00]  It was just done.  People thought we had the greatest lives.  Well, you know, career-wise, of course we did.  Yeah.  Of course we did.  But, uh, there were times where all I wanted to do was, like, not be in that house.  Yeah.  And, uh, I'd walk in, and, uh, remember the candles?  She thought that was going to save the marriage.  We would pull up to the house.  She thought this was going to save the marriage.  We would...  Oh, it was a candle. 
[01:26:30]  We would...  I can't even talk.  We were...  I forgot about this.  I know what he's going to say.  Oh, it was horrible.  We would pull up to the house, and there would be candles lit all over, like, you could see  it from the street.  And for a split second of joy, I thought the place was in flames.  And it wasn't Hanukkah.  It wasn't...  Hanukkah.  And it's not Jewish.  It's like, why the candle? 
[01:27:00]  I asked.  I'm like, Anthony, why the candle?  What are candles doing all over the place?  Like, the lights are all out, because we, you know, obviously we did afternoons, so when  we get home, especially in the winter, it would be dark out.  Yeah, we'd finally make it back to Huntington around 11.  Around 11.  I don't know what the hell time it was.  But we'd pull up to the house, and it's just lit up like when Carrie got back from the  prom.  You know?  I could see your dirty pillars.  Let's go in the closet and pray. 
[01:27:30]  So he'd pull up to the house, and I would just go, oh, no.  I'd go, oh, no.  It's candle night.  It's candle night.  She thinks this is going to do it.  Lighting candles.  She thought that would, like, make the whole scene romantic.  Meanwhile, romance was the last thing.  What was waiting for you inside?  I never asked you that.  The candles.  Mm-hmm.  Dinner.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:28:00]  And then frolicking, if she wanted some type of frolicking.  But what I would do would be eat dinner.  The candle light would kind of be disturbed by me turning the television on.  And then I would work my way over to my desk going, blowing out the candles to the desk,  boot up Half-Life, and play.  Because that's what you had, Half-Life. 
[01:28:30]  That's what I had, Half-Life.  You had Half-Life.  Wow.  Maybe that's why I enjoyed the game so much.  So you figured, might as well play the other half online.  Oh.  You just hear me walking.  Blowing out candles along the way.  It's over, Johnny.  I'm the potty pooper.  That's me.  Shut up.  You don't want to make love?  Oh, dude.  Make love.  The greatest reaction.  Stop it.  He was pulling up, and he would just have this look on his face like, oh, no.  Like, oh, no. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, not candle night.  Jesus, no, not candle night.  Not candle night.  Because in order for there to be candle night, I think she would have to be half in the bag.  So it was candle night.  And you'd come high.  How you doing?  Oh.  Doing a lung test.  Yes.  Let's see how many I could blow out in one breath.  Did you say I love you a lot?  Uh, no.  No.  Especially, like, toward the end. 
[01:29:30]  There was just, you know, maybe one of those, love ya.  Those stand-in for I love.  When someone says I love you, and you get love ya.  Love ya back.  You get that?  It's over.  It's just over.  Me too.  Yeah.  Me too.  Oh, you get a me too.  Love ya.  Me too.  I love myself.  Hate you.  Love me.  Followed by a...  Back at ya, kid. 
[01:30:00]  Back at ya, kiddo.  Well, happy Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  Let me just...  You and yours.  Let's wrap it all up by just wishing everyone for tomorrow happy Valentine's Day.

No, it doesn't stop during the commercials. 
[01:30:30]  I was going to say, just in case you were wondering, he hasn't stopped.  I finally had to say, whoa, whoa, save it for the air.  It doesn't stop.  Jimmy asked him a question.  Jimmy, what was your question again?  I don't remember.  What was it?  Oh, did she ever embarrass you in public?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, you said that she would start drinking.  I'm like, did she ever embarrass you in public?  By the way, this is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, it was like her job.  It was an occupation.  It was her job to annoy you in public.  The public embarrassment factor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Again, it was, you know, hanging out at a bar or something.  And she'd be fine.  A couple of drinks.  And then, wham, it would just hit.  And it was over.  It was just, you know, a totally different person.  And I bring up one time at Fire Island.  I used to go out to Watch Hill out there. 
[01:31:30]  Take the family boat.  Nice, big, what was it, 38-foot Sea Ray.  Nice boat.  Take it out there and just park it in a slip and sit and party all weekend long.  It was good times.  Go out with the band.  And we'd set up and do a gig at the bar over there.  And I had some really good times over there.  And it would just always end up, again, in one of these fiascos. 
[01:32:00]  And the thing about the boat, getting on it.  Now, this had been going on for years.  My mother and Sal and everybody, all the friends had been going to Watch Hill for years.  They all had their boats.  All the friends had boats.  And to get back on the boat from the dock, there's a little gangway.  This thing is probably a couple of feet wide.  And it would go from the dock to the back of the boat.  And you'd walk up. 
[01:32:30]  It's very short.  The boat is backed right up to the dock.  So it's very short.  But you had to walk over to get to the boat.  Well, one evening, as she was walking back onto the boat, we hear a splash.  She fell off the gangway into the green sewage water that everyone dumps their crap boxes from the boats into.  You know, their baby diarrhea. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the crap that comes out of the boat, out of the bilge.  Oil and gas, I'm sure.  Yeah.  She comes up looking like one of the Exxon Valdez penguins.  It's just full of oil and crap and gook.  Actually, I think someone had to stick their hand in and grab her and pull her out.  Okay.  And the wall of these docks that when they go down below water are just stuck with barnacles. 
[01:33:30]  So she tore up the side of herself so bad.  And it was the water so murky that it got that cat scratch red.  You know, and when you get a cat scratch, it's like, oh, it's a little scratch.  And then the next day, ah, medic.  Looks like your arm's going to fall off.  That's what it was like over one whole side of her body.  Just fell right in.  Tipped over.  I was watching the whole thing, too.  She just walked, kind of went, like, sideways. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, she splashed down.  Right in there.  Got pulled out.  I fell in the water.  Yes, you did.  I can't believe I fell in the water.  I can.  Yeah, I can't believe it either.  It's terrible.  Did you try to help her out?  No, other people were there to give her a hand before I could actually get over there.  Yeah, Natalie would, really.  I just kind of, I was actually looking for the keys to start up the engines. 
[01:34:30]  It's on the dock.  It's on the dock.  Wait for it.  Wait.  What are you doing?  Why are you starting up the engines?  Propellers could be a little dangerous.  But that's, she embarrassed you?  Oh, because she did that, that would be an embarrassment.  Yeah, everybody was watching.  The thing is, no one had fallen off of this thing in years.  I mean, it's something you just didn't do. 
[01:35:00]  And people, believe me, were hammered.  It's something you knew when you walked up that gangway.  Even if, you know, you were all teetery on the dock,  you kind of lined yourself up and then ran for it.  So, like, sheer momentum would carry you over.  How far of a walk was it?  It was probably three feet at the most from the dock to the back of the boat.  Three feet over a two-foot wide gangway that you would kind of run up.  You know when you've got to get across something that's slim? 
[01:35:30]  You kind of, if you run a little bit, you get across it easier than if you tried walking across.  That's kind of what you did.  You just kind of gave it a little hop, skip, and a jump, and you're on the boat.  And wham, halfway through.  It's like she's on the Golden Gate Bridge.  It's a gangway.  And bam, right down into the water.  Oh, what a great moment that was.  Memories.  All right.  Soaking wet and bleeding with oil all over her. 
[01:36:00]  Would she ever start shit like around your family?  Jimmy's a potty mouth.  That's not too good.  I love it.  What happened there, Jimmy?  What do you say, Al?  I hope you got it, Al.  What do you say, $40,000?  You just saved the company 40 Gs.  Al, it's $350,000.  Oh, holly, holly, holly, holly, holly. 
[01:36:30]  What do you say, Al?  He got that one.  I'm sure he did.  That's an easy one.  That's easy crap.  That's pop fly.  Yeah, that's like a boring.  I'll catch this.  That's not bad.  I'll catch this with one hand.  One hand looking down on the run.  As I'm looking at the babe in the stands.  I'm bored.  Shagging.  You're running back to the dugout because you know the inning's over.  Just grab it.  I thought this job would be a challenge.  Anyway, what were you saying, Jimmy? 
[01:37:00]  I was wondering, like, I know your mom and I know Sal, and I'm saying, would she ever  get weird or uncomfortable around your family, like, loud and embarrass you and start to  fight?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  God, that had a start.  Let me think.  Oh, at my wedding.  I kid you not.  She got into this screaming match with my brother.  At your wedding.  At my wedding.  To the point where my mother went, what the is wrong with her? 
[01:37:30]  This is wedded bliss.  This is on the wedding day.  Did your mom say that to you?  Yeah.  She goes, what the?  What the?  Yeah, we got it.  We got it.  I got it.  She'd be, what the is wrong with her?  I was like, oh, well.  And then, you know, it started my nine years of making excuses.  That was it.  I'm glad I got to start on day one.  My nine years of making excuses. 
[01:38:00]  Well, you know, it's big day.  Had a little bit to drink.  So, you know.  A little bit crazy.  You know.  Oh, yeah, that.  Oh.  Because apparently my brother was trying to pick up on one of our cousins that were down  from Massachusetts.  Isn't that what your family members are supposed to do at a wedding?  Of course it is.  Of course.  Check out the new talent and see what you can get.  Of course.  Sneak into the bathroom and make waterheads.  Right.  You pull the old Sonny Corleone up in the bedroom. 
[01:38:30]  That's what weddings are for.  So, Joe is.  Sonny.  Yeah, be right, town.  So, Joe's scooping out the talent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she, for some reason, found this disrespectful.  Scooping out.  I know.  Scooping out.  I tried to say that.  Checking out.  Whatever.  Scoping.  Scoping.  I meant to say, sure.  Scoping out the talent.  Scooping.  Wow.  Dude.  Yeah.  I think she didn't do an incest reference about families that aren't related.  I enjoyed that, actually.  But it didn't make sense because Anthony's family wouldn't have been related to her family, 
[01:39:00]  so they wouldn't have made waterheads.  I just.  I was totally.  True.  Both of us went down together.  You were thinking that brother Joe was picking up his own cousin.  Yeah.  I'll help you out.  All right.  So what happened?  So what happened?  So Joe was, like, trying to pick up someone from her family?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, believe me.  It's Joe.  Would have just been, you know.  Thank you.  Good night.  So, yeah.  She found this, like, disrespectful to do on the wedding day. 
[01:39:30]  This grandiose wedding.  Yeah.  This grandiose class wedding.  That was happening.  It was not a time or place to try to pick up a family member.  This grandiose.  What do you think you're doing, you f***ing?  I'm a c***er.  I'm a c***er.  I'm a c***er.  It was just like Princess Diane's wedding.  Oh, of course.  It had all the features.  I only wish it ended like her life did.  This grandiose wedding.  Flesh.  Weren't you, like, married in a basement or something? 
[01:40:00]  A basement.  It was the actual wedding took place in Northport.  As a matter of fact, right down the road.  I wouldn't know this until later, but right down the road from Opie's house in Northport,  where you were living when you were working at BAB.  Which church?  It wasn't a church.  It was a justice of the peace that lived down there.  It was some guy's house.  I went to a guy's house.  To get married?  To get married.  And this old guy comes out of this back room with his wife. 
[01:40:30]  That he just banged?  Yeah, no, no.  He's like some old guy.  They're probably swingers, though.  Maybe.  This is how they pick up couples.  Maybe.  You never know.  And so he comes out.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Everything was signed.  And that's it.  I was married.  I was hoping, like, I would read in the paper that he was a fraud.  Like, for years, I was looking for his name.  He's going, please.  Like, fraud.  Justice of the Peace.  How many wedding marriages aren't real?  And I'd be like, oh, please be this guy. 
[01:41:00]  Please be.  Damn it.  You're looking at the certificate, hoping they spilled Anthony wrong.  Yeah, just some glitch.  I don't like when you get, like, a parking ticket.  Get out of a ticket.  My car's red.  Wow, this is a blue car.  Right.  I'm out.  Got my age wrong.  This is great.  So justice of the peace.  Yeah.  And that's how the whole thing was supposed to happen.  But then she started getting this bug about, you know, well, my mom wants to come down and see.  And then because that mom wants to come down that, you know, then my mother has to see because she'd feel left out. 
[01:41:30]  And then if these two are going to be there, then this one.  And before you know it, there was a lot of people with nowhere to go for a wedding because I didn't have the proverbial pot to in or a window to throw it out of, as they say.  So we had this huge bunch of people and nothing to really do with them.  No planning went behind this.  So it was just like, ah, we'll go to the bar my mother works at and set up some kind of chafing dishes with some ziti in it. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Awful, huh?  Bon voyage, couple.  Have a good one.  Godspeed.  Some ziti and a Carvel wedding cake.  There's nothing worse than a bar wedding cake.  That was me.  And it was married in Northport and honeymooned in East Northport.  That was it.  Honeymooning Comac.  What a mess. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, so that was it.  It was a justice of the peace.  And then the big argument, because then we all went back to the house we were living at and there was a carryover of the party there.  And that's where the big blowout with my brother happened.  And I'm making excuses already.  Like, oh, yeah, well, you know how it is.  But knowing your brother, he wasn't disrespectful.  He was just trying to pick up a...  No.  It had nothing to do with...  He was just trying to pick up a girl at a wedding. 
[01:43:00]  It had nothing to do with being disrespectful.  It's just...  It's what guys do at weddings, first of all.  It was not...  But, you know, this is the unreasonable thing I was talking about.  Right.  What are you doing?  My God, Brian.  Yeah.  And she went up.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  It's all coming back to me.  It wasn't only...  Because my brother was at the point where he just turned around and said, you know something?  F*** you.  And just walked away from the fight. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, boy.  So she walks up to my mother.  Oh, boy.  My poor mommy is sitting on a couch with duct tape on the arm.  I can't even look.  In a house full of cat hair.  In this little crap hole basement apartment.  Yeah.  She's sitting on this couch.  Yeah.  And my brand new bride walks up to my mother, gets right in her face and goes,  Your f***ing son is a f***ing... 
[01:44:00]  F***ing son is a f***ing son, and my mother is just like sitting there and looks at me like,  Excuse me?  You know, I've been around a few too many years to have to put up with this kind of s***, Anthony.  Didn't you learn from me?  Yeah.  Didn't you learn from me?  Right.  So glad you picked up on that life lesson.  She started yelling at my mother, calling my brother an a-hole. 
[01:44:30]  Oh.  And I'm like, Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  This is not going well.  How glad are you?  More booze!  How glad are you that you never had kids?  I could not be happier.  And how did you escape that one?  I don't know.  Luck of the draw, my friend.  Fanny or face.  Luck of the draw.  Fanny or face.  Well, we know what it shows.  Back to Zha Zha rules.  Fanny or face.  How long did you date this chick for? 
[01:45:00]  Because I didn't know any of your...  It was...  Let me think.  But you don't know his ex?  No, I met her one time at your dad's leg, actually.  It was the only time I ever met or saw her.  I didn't know what she looks.  I wouldn't remember her as she walked in this room.  Was she surprised you weren't serving cocktails?  Jesus.  So how did you escape the old children?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know. 
[01:45:30]  You figure nine, well, eight years.  Just luck of the draw, I guess.  Timing.  Because at some point, because she wanted to have kids, too.  So at one point, we went to this...  In Boston, went to this fertility clinic to see if one of us had a problem.  And I had to give a little sample.  And they checked it out.  And mine checked out fine.  They're like, look at them.  Look at them.  They're swimming.  There's plenty of them. 
[01:46:00]  It's like a party going on.  They all got goatees.  They're ready to go.  They're ready to go.  They're ready to fertilize.  Maybe they knew.  They saw it and went.  One of them held all of them back.  Wait, guys.  Boys, boys.  Hold on.  Boys, stop in your tracks.  Look.  I know you want to do this.  The egg is right here.  But I implore you.  Don't touch it.  It will be years of misery. 
[01:46:30]  Turn around and go back the way you came.  C-A-M-E, Al.  Oh, it's the same way, isn't it?  Sorry.  Send that back the way it came.  You think they would try to just avoid it altogether and go, all right, look, aim for the thighs.  It was one of those situations where, yeah, I got checked out, and then I guess we never pursued it past that as far as checking out to see if everything was okay. 
[01:47:00]  So she just assumed you were the problem.  I don't know.  Well, you were always the problem in her eyes.  Perhaps.  Perhaps that was it.  I was just the problem.  In her eyes.  What I could do, no right.  Right.  That was pretty much it.  Dude, I can't get enough of this.  I can't comprehend it.  Because it just keeps happening. 
[01:47:30]  See, you know how I can't comprehend a lot of the things?  This is how I feel when you talk.  Like, you can't possibly.  You're looking at me like.  Yeah, this is what it looks like, Jimmy.  Yeah, this is what it looks like.  Wait.  Is this a tranny story?  I get it.  This is why.  I don't know why.  And I don't know why I stayed in it that long.  It just, it just, years kind of went by.  And then once the radio gig came along, I was so fixated on that. 
[01:48:00]  That's what I tell people.  That it just didn't matter.  I could, didn't matter.  I could care less who I was married to at that point in my life.  That's what I tell people.  Because they ask me.  Because I stayed in my relationship way too long.  And I'm like, I think Aunt and I were in, we were in the same place.  And we were like going for this radio goal that it was like, ugh, problems, but whatever.  Just focused on our careers.  It made it.  I might have been out of my marriage sooner if I didn't get into radio. 
[01:48:30]  I think I might have been out of it sooner.  Right.  But, you know, who knows.  We were taking on the world.  So it was like, oh, that crap was secondary.  It was like, oh, I'll get to that eventually.  We don't have a major change too.  What?  When you're doing like, when you're doing a big gig, you don't need like a major personal  life change too.  Sometimes like leave the status quo.  It's like, all right, all right, all right.  Well, that didn't even matter either to me.  Like, especially we had just gotten the gig and everything and it was brand new, like  radio to me.  I'd never done it before. 
[01:49:00]  So any problems in the marriage was offset by, I don't care.  Honestly.  I'm frigging going to a dream gig.  And honestly, if we were in good relationships, we would have still had to put all that on hold  and make some sacrifices because this was it.  It was happening.  We were in the moment.  It just made it easier because that was what it was.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  We had to work our asses off back in the day.  Now we don't work at all.  This is beautiful.  Wedding day.  I can't believe she yelled at my mother on our wedding day.  How long did you make work? 
[01:49:30]  I forgot about that.  Oh, right, right, right.  It had to be about, let me see.  It was just short of a year.  Oh, wow.  It's kind of short of a year.  What happened?  Yeah.  It was short of a year that we were going out.  But again, I had said before, I had thought it was time.  You know, for me to get married.  I was, I had to be a big boy.  I had to be an adult.  I used to go down to the bar where my mother used to work and sit down and everybody that  was there, I was still like Rosie's kid. 
[01:50:00]  You know, I was like, hey, Rosie, get your kid a drink.  And it's like, well, I'm still just, I'm Rosie's kid.  Like, I'm not a guy.  I'm not going to be a guy until I start doing like, I'm not going to be a man guy until I  start doing man guy things.  And getting married is one of them.  So I figured now is time to do that, you know, get to get a house, do things that you're  supposed to do when you grow up.  And then I realized, oh, this growing up crap is for the birds.  I'm going to stay a man child.  Okay. 
[01:50:30]  There's a lot more to get.  Oh, of course there is.  First, I can't believe that he was a codependent.  I can't believe Anthony was a codependent.  This is ours.  And I have to say, how did you ask?  How did you ask?  I can't picture him being.  Oh, that story is just funny.  Oh, we've told that one.  It's ridiculous.  It's one of the saddest, most ridiculous, unromantic stories.  We've got to save for another time.  Yeah.  We're late.  We've got to go sell some more crap.  We'll be back. 
[01:51:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  What's up, guys?  Hope you're enjoying the festivities today.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  A few minutes left.  Tyra had some terrific guests on her show the other day.  Did she?  How did she turn it around to talk about her?  Well, she was talking to girls that had that fish odor syndrome. 
[01:51:30]  Trimethylaminura.  To your skin stinks, right?  All that stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So we got that.  And we got English TV portraying Americans as stupid.  All right.  What do you want to do?  I like to hear the fishy thing, I think.  Fishy thing?  Yeah.  It's always funny when women smell like fish and have no control over it. 
[01:52:00]  Shower after shower, it doesn't matter.  They get right out.  Fish.  Right out of their skin, out of their pores.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The neck, the face.  Dummies trying to wash up fish are in the water all the time.  You take them out, they still smell like fish.  It's not like a shower's going to help.  You smell like a fish.  That's right.  You're dirty and God made you that way.  Accept it.  Accept it, breeder.  What is it, a chemical that's released?  Yeah, there's some kind of weird chemistry going on inside them and it comes out their pores. 
[01:52:30]  You would think the obvious joke about that, but it's not.  It comes out of everywhere.  It comes out of their sweat, their breath.  Everything is just fishy.  So it's not just one area?  Yeah, and it is, you know, all areas, so you're also getting that treat.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  Well, here we go.  We meet Tammy.  Before I had trimethylaminuria, I was a go-getter. 
[01:53:00]  I remember having confidence and being outgoing.  I was a huge people person.  Life is much different now.  I feel held hostage to my odor.  By far the most devastating part of this disorder has been that I've lost my ability to do what I love,  and that is to teach.  Kids tell me that, teacher, your smell makes my tummy hurt, and those kinds of things begin to take a toll on you, 
[01:53:30]  and now I'm at the point where I never want to leave my home.  Teacher, your smell makes my tummy hurt.  Oh, that's brutal.  All you want to do is mold young minds, and they're physically ill around you.  Their tummies hurt because you stink.  So happy.  Hey, wait, what?  Now, what?  I didn't know you could catch that.  You're not born with it?  No, you have to be born.  You have to be. 
[01:54:00]  I think you're born with it, and then, you know, it kind of pops up after a few years, maybe.  I guess it just took a long time for someone to tell her that she smells.  Or maybe once you go through puberty and you have all those changes and stuff, that's when it happens.  Or maybe it just happens anytime.  I don't know about this.  I don't know either.  It's ironic.  I was going out with a guy named Gil.  Okay.  I had to say it, though.  And he was always suspicious.  Well.  Hey, wait. 
[01:54:30]  Can we get one of those people in here?  Something fishy about you.  Oh, yes.  It's your being.  By the way, Tammy doesn't like to fly.  Tammy, why?  Tammy, you begged us to let you drive all the way from Washington to Los Angeles.  You did not want to get on a plane.  Why is that?  Why?  With TMAU, your odor is so offensive and it's so widespread that it's easy to be able to offend the entire airplane. 
[01:55:00]  The entire airplane.  The entire airplane.  The 747, the biggest airplane there is.  An entire airplane, a conference room, an auditorium.  It's a very unusual odor that people don't understand.  They don't understand that it's that widespread.  So an auditorium.  An auditorium.  Like this room.  Like this room.  You could have been the whole room.  If I sit here long enough, your entire audience will be able to smell me. 
[01:55:30]  What a treat.  Kill her!  Next is Giant Stadium.  I can't even go to the Super Bowl.  It's genetic.  It worsens around puberty and menopause.  And there is no treatment.  Oh, yes, there is.  Our Bud Dwyer had it.  The old baggie with a pistol in it.  Eat that, stupid.  It'll take care of everything.  Swallow this, stinky.  Well, after Tammy said that, well, Tyra said this. 
[01:56:00]  Panty party!  She thought it must have been panty party time.  It's got to be panty party time.  Panty party!  Well, she handed the panties out and people put them over their face.  They didn't have to smell old stinko.  By the way, we're getting ready to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll get an early one from Justin in New Hampshire.  Justin, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  I learned nothing because learning is for queers.  Boy, Justin. 
[01:56:30]  Frankus.  Boy.  And Frankus, of course.  Are we still allowed to say that word on the radio?  Or is that the next word that'll be off limits?  I use it on TV all the time.  That's right.  It's accepted in the community.  Don't understand why the...  And that wasn't even used in that context.  Yeah.  Enough.  Don't understand what's going on here.  I don't really understand.  Oh, you just reminded me.  Me.  Ah, here's Tyra.  Asks if the smell comes from her...  Wow. 
[01:57:00]  Going out on a limb.  And where does the smell come from?  Because I would, you know, to be as respectful, but to be honest, you know, when there's like  these jokes about women, you know, like, oh, she smells like fish.  And we know that that smell can come from your private area.  That's true.  And for me, it is.  It manifested as a vaginal odor.  And it just, no matter what I do, I always have that odor. 
[01:57:30]  Now...  So is it all coming from your vaginal area?  It started off that way.  And now it comes out through my body pores, too.  Everywhere.  Everywhere.  Through everything.  Every pore of my body.  What did this girl look like?  There's only one thing to say.  Same.  Same.  Same.  Same on you.  Ah, Sam.  God.  What did she look like?  Because if she was the least bit attractive, that is the funniest joke God has ever played. 
[01:58:00]  She was...  She wasn't bad looking.  Yeah, not bad.  She seemed psychotic because she kept twitching and opening her eyes really wide.  Yeah, you would, too.  You would, too, if you smelled like fish instead of had a head full of candy.  That's right.  All your candy would smell bad.  How awful would that be?  Have a Jolly Rancher.  It's fish-scented.  I don't like fishy Jolly Ranchers.  Good to see you made it to work today, Sam.  Yeah.  Good to see you stopped in.  No broken headlights or anything that shut down your whole brain?  Hi, Daddy.  Did Dad drop you off?  Send you up on a little lunch? 
[01:58:30]  All right.  That's true.  Little brown bag.  Another early, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned that fanny her face prevents children.  Fuck it!  Fanny her face.  That's the birth control method we're using.  Yeah.  All right, we got one more clip.  So she's kind of hot?  Ugly.  But she can go out to, like, a bar or something and get picked up and then, wow. 
[01:59:00]  Is she average with really long nails?  All right, here we go.  Temperament of a piranha instead of the scent?  Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.  Yeah.  And you're in the house most of the time because you don't want to offend people.  She calls it the aquarium.  Because I don't want to offend people.  And because of my own, you're just tormented. 
[01:59:30]  I mean, I just can't begin to tell you the level of torment that you endure with this.  Come on, give us some of those tears.  It's an effect that you should not smell.  And when you have a smell that you can't get rid of, it's tormenting.  And because I can never smell myself, I never know if it's okay to go out.  So I don't want to go out.  Should I get a bird like miners do?  If it drops dead in the cage.  A canary, yeah.  A canary in a coal mine.  A canary in a coal mine, yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Wow, that sounds like an awful disease.  It's awful.  Oh, well.  Someone's saying she ought to...  Sucks to be Tammy.  She ought to get Summer's Eve tartar sauce.  Let's say I had a bat on Long Island.  Bat.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Good morning.  Hey.  I was watching that yesterday with my wife.  I got home early from work.  Yeah.  You know, buggy-eyed weirdo, let me tell you.  Buggy-eyed weirdo?  Well, you would look like that, too, if all you smelled all day long is rotting garbage. 
[02:00:30]  You would have to make that this face.  And she was getting those oohs and aahs from the audience, like, ooh.  Tammy makes this face, don't they?  This face.  They call her Clammy Tammy.  Flicking around, and there's...  I looked at my wife, like, what are we watching this for?  Oh, because it's just great TV.  I want to smell one of those.  I want to get one of those people next to us.  Now we should get one in.  We have to.  Are we allowed?  Are we allowed to?  Yeah, as long as they keep their clothes on. 
[02:01:00]  Can we get a fishy, smelly woman in here?  I don't know if we're allowed.  How about a bounty?  We put out a bounty.  That's right.  I'll make it half a market all day again.  I'll tell you that much.  I'll put up $100.  You put up $100.  They're $300.  That's right.  Come on.  You just come in.  We smell you.  You get the hell out.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  So a quick couple of what did we learn?  Scoot from New York, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, guys.  I learned that 40 years ago, Josh out with 50.  Peronkis.  Thank you. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I see what's going on.  Nick in Philly.  I learned that if you suck on a tailpipe hard enough, you're going to die.  You're going to die.  That's right.  Well, we're getting ready to leave.  I learned something.  And go to the place where they really, really like us.  And I got an email waiting for us at XM today.  Yeah.  Cotton candy.  Oh.  Birthday cake, even though it's no one's birthday.  Pony rides.  Pony rides.  Party balloons.  Yep.  Hats. 
[02:02:00]  And smiles.  And things to open.  Ew.  What is this fatty?  Well, they're advertising the push-up bra for the fatties.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Yeah, you better cover that up.  Even the fat girl knows she better cover that up.  Oh, look at those knees.  It's like elephant legs.  A push-up bra.  It's just two red forklifts.  And look, they've got to make believe that she's sexy.  That's this old gag. 
[02:02:30]  See, even a regular girl could look good if you have the proper lingerie.  These are big girls.  And they're wearing lingerie, which really trims them down and makes them.  Who cares if they're flattest pancakes?  That's not bad, though.  You could use a push-up bra and make them look sexy.  Look, these are the hottest fat girls you're going to get, though, Jimmy.  You've got to realize this.  These are the absolute hottest fat girls you're ever going to see.  They're models.  Yeah.  So when Fatty sees this and decides she's going to buy it, it ain't even going to look like it does on her. 
[02:03:00]  No.  Thank you.  Two quick things.  Can I get out real quick?  Oh, please.  One, I'll be in Lancaster this weekend.  What?  Lancaster.  Help me.  I'll be in Lancaster this weekend.  Lancaster with the Amateur.  Going to the Italian villa.  And I just found out Otto and George is on Letterman tomorrow night.  Wow.  I can't be happier for anybody than I am for Otto and George.  What the hell is he going to say?  It's going to be the greatest four minutes.  Oh, don't miss that.  Holy Jesus.  Yeah, we love Otto and George.  I mean, seriously, let's put out an alert. 
[02:03:30]  Please watch Letterman tonight and check out Otto and George.  Oh, tomorrow night.  I think tomorrow night.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Tomorrow night and check out Otto and George.  It's about time.  Otto and George on David Letterman tomorrow night.  And we couldn't be happier for Otto.  Our pal.  Maybe we'll call him.  Can we get him in here or talk to him tomorrow?  Just to see if he's nervous and all that.  He's probably going to be a little nervous.  All right.  We'll try to get Otto on the show tomorrow.  But once again, Otto and George tomorrow night on Letterman.  That is huge for him.  We're very, very happy for Otto and his little puppet, George. 
[02:04:00]  Also, there's a clown over at XM.  A clown?  A clown.  And he's going to do juggling and ride a unicycle.  And we're going to all get face painted.  Yeah.  Our faces are going to be painted.  I want a star.  I thought you meant our security.  Would you like a balloon, gentlemen?  All right.  We're going over to a happy place.  If you're not joining us, have a great day. 
[02:04:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're going over to a happy place. 
[02:05:00]  We're going over to a happy place. 
[02:05:30]  We're going over to a happy place. 
[02:06:00]  We're going over to a happy place. 
[02:06:30]  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place. 
[02:07:00]  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  We're going over to a happy place.  THE END 
[02:07:30]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe. 
[02:08:00]  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards. 
[02:08:30]  We have the effect of talent all PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:09:00]  Good morning, X-Mers.  How are you today?  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.  No shit.  What?  X-M Satellite Radio.  It's on the satellite.  It's on the satellite and it's a happy place.  For now.  And then they'll be pissed at us and the other place will love us. 
[02:09:30]  Whatever.  It's amazing.  Whatever.  They're like tag team assholes.  Tag.  Uh-oh.  Your turn.  Your turn to love them.  To shit on them or love them.  Here.  I don't want them.  Spin the wheel.  Who's shitting on us and who's loving us?  Is daddy loving us or is it mommy?  Oh.  Whatever.  I don't even know which is which in this business.  Okay.  We got lots to do.  We really do. 
[02:10:00]  We got Ralphie Mae outside studio.  Yep.  We got the best of Mike Tyson.  It's a fine video that's on.  Best of?  Where's this one?  Gorilla Mask?  He's putting on a best of album.  How many hits did he have?  It's a video on GorillaMask.net.  It's a video of all his greatest lines.  It's on Gorilla Mask.  That's funny.  I find that funny all in itself.  Tap, tap.  And then we got kids ruining a romance.  And we also have the top 20 guitar heroes according to Rolling Stone Magazine. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, not a list.  And Steve is pissed off though.  I wasn't going to go with the list today, but Steve's like, where's Steve Vai?  Where's Steve Vai?  Exactly.  Where is Steve Vai?  Shut up.  I love this list.  Do you?  Uh-oh.  My friend is on it.  Who?  Your good friend.  My fucking, my pal is very high on this list.  Yes, he is.  And from what I know, I don't know enough about his music, to be honest with you.  From what I've heard, it's deservedly so. 
[02:11:00]  Of who?  Of your friend?  Mm-hmm.  I just, I know, I know like some of the songs, but I don't know a lot of his extensive guitar  work.  Wow.  A lot of these guys, I don't even know, man.  But number one in Rolling Stone.  Is this, but this says top 20 new guitar guys.  New guitar guys.  Oh, that's why I know Steve Vai.  So, Steve Vai.  You dope.  Steve Vai.  Yeah, he's not new.  It's 20-some-odd years ago.  What about Steve Carr?  Steve Vai. 
[02:11:30]  Where the hell's he been?  What?  Can I just get one of those?  Why?  There you go.  Wow.  Rolling Stone.  All right.  My God.  Congratulations to John Mayer.  I'm on the cover.  I was sitting right there.  Number one for Rolling Stone's new guitar guys, Mayer.  John Mayer.  God damn, man.  He knows how to play the blues.  Blues making a little bit of a comeback.  Yeah.  A little bit, a little bit.  In these trying times, blah, blah, shit.  I like the blues. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, he's supposedly a great, great style blues guy.  Feels better.  Yeah.  B.B. King likes them.  All these fucking great guitarists.  I'm so jealous.  Famous people never like me.  Aw.  You know who likes me?  Fan and Travis.  Edward Norton likes you.  Exactly.  Not enough to come in the studio and give me a handshake, though.  Apparently not.  Yeah.  Hey, can we bang your broad?  Oh, sorry.  If they were asking me, I was going to say yes.  Jesus.  Whatever makes you happy.  Whatever makes you happy, bosses.  Before Valentine's Day, I was just trying to be shocking. 
[02:12:30]  You're a shock shock.  I was shocking, wasn't I?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We got a couple out-of-towners checking out the show today.  You can still come by and hang and check out the show just because we're not doing the  walk for another, I don't know, like month.  Can my stupid video get, it's got 1,070,239 views on break?  I'm obsessed with your video, Anthony.  305,000 on YouTube?  Your video, as far as YouTube goes, is the number one Opie and Anthony video now, surpassing 
[02:13:00]  Bill Burr's fine performance down there in Philly on that stage.  That is amazing.  Bill Burr had the number one Opie and Anthony video.  You are in the top slot.  If I would have known, I'd have done a little more production on it.  You installing Vista.  It looks so indie.  Vista, right?  Yes, Vista.  Stupid Vista.  And just when I thought the video was dead, it's getting viewed, I was going to say like  crazy, which I love to say a lot, but the views have gone way up in the last couple 
[02:13:30]  days alone.  Should I push it with a follow-up?  No, no, no.  No sequel?  No, don't go for the follow-up hit.  Follow-up doesn't work.  No, no, no.  It worked for a lot of the thematic YouTube things, like that girl that just babbles.  Lonely girl?  Lonely girl.  Worked for her.  No.  Maybe I could be one of these YouTube people.  You're a one-hit wonder.  I'm a one-hit wonder on YouTube.  No.  I thought so.  No, we should do.  There are so many bands out there that had one hit.  I want to hear the follow-up hit. 
[02:14:00]  How can we get that done today?  Follow-up hit.  It's hilarious, the drop-off.  It's beyond hilarious, because the one hit is like, wow, this song is awesome.  Of course they had to have another one.  And then the second one is kind of like the retired version of the one-hit wonder.  Okay, what was the second song that Dexy's Midnight Runners put out?  There you go.  We can start there.  Come on, Eileen was huge.  Right.  We're going to need some help.  I just watched VH1's One-Hit Wonders over the weekend, last weekend, so I kind of know 
[02:14:30]  a few of them.  You do?  Yeah.  Tommy Two-Tone, 867-5309.  Jenny.  867-5309.  But congrats on the video, by the way.  Jennifer.  It's unbelievable.  Yes.  Wow.  Break.com, 1.1 million views.  I'm over a million views on that.  And you're closing in on the Baby Bird video on Break.com.  On Break.com, the number one Opie and Anthony video is Baby Bird.  Followed by, I think, someone getting pwned.  Pwned. 
[02:15:00]  I think Craig getting hit with the kickball got a bunch of hits, over a million hits, and  then you.  But you're moving up that list really fast, too.  Moving up the charts.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is something.  See, I struck a nerve with that because a lot of people are pissed off.  And then it keeps going because they get annoyed.  They look on the internet for something that, you know, other people annoyed with Vista,  and then they find that video.  Well, the best is the comments because now they're in different languages.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  It's starting to go worldwide.  Wow.  That's pretty cool, man.  They're calling me an asshole in like every language now.  The Hines of language is Chinese.  And that's what makes me laugh when reading this stuff because we all know Anthony a lot  better than these people that are assuming stuff about your computer skill.  Like computer prowess.  And Anthony's way up there.  When it comes to the average man, you're way up there.  You know what you're doing around a computer, and these people really think you're just a  dope.  I'm a noob.  They call me noob.  That's leet speak. 
[02:16:00]  I'm a noob.  I'm a noob.  What?  Not a noob.  Exactly.  Snap man from Whack Bag.  I'm a boob.  You're a boob and a roob, but not a noob.  Let's see.  Aha's follow-up to take on me was, the sun always shines on TV.  The sun shines on TV.  Sun shines on TV.  It's got, they're always the hit kind of sideways.  Yeah.  Like they try to recapture the hit. 
[02:16:30]  We have some coming in?  Uh, Bill.  Bill.  We have the follow-up to Come on Eileen by.  Oof.  It's Wipe Off Eileen.  It's called, uh, Jackie Wilson said it's a live version.  Oh.  A live version.  Jesus.  Jackie Wilson said.  And then in parentheses, I'm in heaven when you smile.  Ugh.  Ew.  I thought I was go take a shower, you daffy bastard. 
[02:17:00]  You filthy whore.  Right.  All right, let's hear a little of Come on Eileen, first of all.  I bet he won't have that.  Oh, God.  Why is he still in that position?  Why?  That's all I want to know.  Oh, look, now he's all upset.  Is he on the phone?  Who, Bill?  Yeah, Bill.  Bill has trouble finding things quickly.  It's true.  You know why?  He had a tough act to follow.  I got to give Derek, uh, credit.  Where is Derek?  Derek was always very good.  Derek, uh, passed away some years ago. 
[02:17:30]  Hopefully it was because he's wearing those faggoty shoes.  Open-toed, sleigh-stacked feet.  Died of toe aids from his shoes.  Derek basically said, I'm too good for this job.  Yep.  Get someone else to do it.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm busy.  Derek is always locked in production now.  Yeah.  He's a production guy.  He's uncomfortable in studio.  So when I go in there and have to do a read, it's Derek I get to look at.  All right, we got, uh, come on, Eileen, Bill?  All right.  I was just kidding, Bill.  Relax.  Yeah, Bill's got to relax.  He takes that very seriously. 
[02:18:00]  He takes everything seriously.  You're a good boy, Bill.  There's no joking with Bill.  And now he's looking at me like, what?  What?  Trust me, we just know at this point, Bill.  You see little thin lips all tight.  All right, let's hear it.  Come on, Eileen, Bill.  Here we go.  That's good.  Who doesn't remember this?  Right.  Ah.  You're home of rock and roll.  How many times they play this on BAB?  My God. 
[02:18:30]  Fanny, your face.  Fanny, your face.  All right, we got that one.  Yeah.  All right, there's come on, Eileen.  Irish rock.  So did you have the follow-up, too, there, Bill?  All right, so that was a massive song, obviously. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, huge hit.  Everyone knew it.  I had no idea they actually had another song that, uh, that, I guess,  got a little play on the radio.  Right?  Give that one a listen.  And what's this called again there, Dan?  Jackie.  Jackie Wilson.  Why would this work?  Jackie Wilson.  Why would this work?  Are we on here, Bill?  All right.  Jackie Wilson said,  That Bill's an ass.  Thank God there's no ratings over here.  We can just relax and laugh at ourselves.  Jackie Wilson said, and then in parentheses, 
[02:19:30]  I'm in heaven when you smile.  All right, let's hear this.  All right.  This is the follow-up to Come on, Eileen.  Oh, this is like an old song.  It's a remake.  It's a remake.  You can't have a follow-up that's a remake.  That doesn't really gauge that.  This sucks fucking balls.  They showed what this guy's doing now. 
[02:20:00]  He was laying down on a floor,  barely covered with some feathers,  and almost nude in some kind of gay show tune shit.  Like the guy just lost his fucking mind  after, I guess, Come on, Eileen.  Wait, he's a gay dude singing about Coming on Eileen?  I gather he's some kind of homosexual. 
[02:20:30]  Let's go to the homo expert.  Travis was grabbing the mic.  I thought you wanted to get some info.  No?  All right, no.  You know nothing about this subject?  It looked like you were going to chime in about this.  Oh, he was just reaching for water.  Unfortunately for Travis,  we thought it was something different.  Unfortunately, the water is stored in Bill's cock.  That's what it looked like he was reaching for.  A pulp dispenser.  So now we have the follow-up to Soft Cell.  They did Tainted Love. 
[02:21:00]  Tainted Love was a giant, huge hit.  All right.  What's that say?  Bedsitter.  Bedsitter?  Bedsitter is their follow-up.  That was the follow-up to Tainted Love.  Bedsitter.  All right, let's hear Bedsitter.  I bet there's a whoa in the song somehow.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah.  This wasn't the 80s, was it?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Homo porn. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Nice.  Sloppy party bottom.  Sunday morning going flow.  I'm talking to the radio.  A little bit of a drop-off, huh?  Just as bit.  From Tainted Love.  Memories of the night before.  Out in club land, having fun.  And now I'm hiding from the sun.  Waiting for a visit.  Derek Forrest. 
[02:22:00]  Of the sort.  I'm here for sure.  The Tainted Love part.  Tainted Love.  Oh.  Tainted Love.  Here it is.  Nothing is drinking.  Nothing is staying.  And now I'm all alone in Betsy's land.  My only home.  This is what, like, XM 80s plays.  It's like, how about playing the hit? 
[02:22:30]  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  Who knew?  Damn.  Who knew?  That stunk.  That really was bad.  What's up, Ralph?  That had that fish disease.  Yeah.  Ralphie May in studio.  Hey, man.  Thank y'all for playing horrible music on my way in.  Yeah, why not?  I don't want to be brought on to something cool.  Brought on to the fucking second song that the Tainted Love band put out.  Yeah.  It's off to sell.  Anyone can kill when there's cool music in the world.  All right.  Let's see what you got now, funny boy. 
[02:23:00]  Dance, fatty.  Dance.  Make this funny.  Got another example.  Oh, right, said friend?  Yes.  What was his song again?  I'm Too Sexy.  It was I'm Too Sexy.  Is that really a song?  Do we have a little taste of I'm Too Sexy?  You want a little taste?  Could you just say, could we hear a little?  I thought it was like a gap.  Fan of your face.  You just chose face.  Oh.  Oh.  You just wanted to dance a little bit.  Yeah.  Well, I'm reading this amazing thing from Manolo, but now I can't. 
[02:23:30]  You just got to move.  Yeah.  It's a catwalk.  On the catwalk.  It's a catwalk.  I take it up the ass.  Yeah.  Most times on the catwalk, they're fucking pushing an IV and wearing an open-backed little  little hospital Johnny.  I guess.  I am too sexy for my land.  Too sexy for my land.  I take it in my can.  I want to hear the part where he goes, it hurts.  Is this the dance version? 
[02:24:00]  I am too sexy for your party.  Too sexy for your party.  The way I'm disco dancing.  I'm a model.  You know what I mean?  All right, dude.  My little turn on.  That is awful.  What are you laughing at?  The title of Right Said Fred's follow-up is, Don't Talk, Just Kiss.  Yeah, baby.  Nice.  We're talking about men here. 
[02:24:30]  Great.  Can we hear it?  I'm too sexy for...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Stereo.  Wow.  This just sounds gay.  This is the sound of gay.  Too sexy for my... 
[02:25:00]  Come on.  That's too sexy.  Let me loose on you.  Inch by inch.  The one and only reason.  It's fun, fun, fun.  By inch.  I said, well, baby.  Well, baby.  We've only just begun.  So don't talk.  Just kiss.  We'll be all...  They're the same stupid, I'm too sexy drums and everything.  Don't talk.  You've got to think the record company's like, oh, shit.  A one-hit wonder.  Great. 
[02:25:30]  Baja Men.  Who Let the Dogs Out?  We all remember that song.  Oh, who could forget?  Yeah.  Played everywhere at everything.  Weddings.  Ballgames.  Who Let the Dogs Out?  Yeah.  Who Let the Dogs Out?  Oh, God.  I still fucking cringe.  Who Let the Dogs Out?  Jimmy's dancing again.  It's fun.  Who Let the Dogs Out?  It's a fun song.  When the party was nice, the party was...  All right.  Oh, that part stinks.  He's ready to hit the hook.  I never...  They ought to play that at the funerals of children that get mauled by pit bulls. 
[02:26:00]  How great would that be?  How great is it?  You absolutely...  That is exactly what I was thinking about how funny it is if a kid get ripped apart by  a dog.  And you just play that?  Why with a bad song do we go to child mauling death?  Child mauling.  Because we're in a bad mood so everyone else should be.  That's right.  Suffer, kid.  And their hit...  A follow-up?  Um...  You all dat.  You all dat. 
[02:26:30]  Right?  Rip off of the token song.  Yes, I knew the answer to that.  Yeah.  I was up with the moon and down with the stars and the party was carrying on. 
[02:27:00]  All the girls were outside kicking sand, sipping on mojitos.  And all the boys were standing around nursing a cold one.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
[02:27:30]  want to hear. Now we all know  this hit. This song  was giant.  One of the biggest songs  of the 80s. I'm sketching.  Oh, I'll be drawing the video  for me. There he is.  Oh, there's the bad race car guy with the wrench.  Look out.  Oh, he hit him. I'm sketching. 
[02:28:00]  I'm sketching.  But Opie, look, he's moving and he's banging.  He's trying to get out of the comic frame.  I'm sketching.  New frame, new frame. Sketching and sketching.  Don't let him get out of the comic frame  because he's a faggot.  Keep the queer within the square.  Everyone knows this one.  I know a little something about A-ha.  Yeah.  Massive in Europe. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Selling out stadiums to this day.  Here it is.  Take on me.  Take on me.  Song no one can sing.  You can sing to a certain point.  On me.  Some people could do this.  I got the high now.  Okay.  Let's hear it.  You're a little sharp.  A little sharp. 
[02:29:00]  That was a little pitchy, dog.  A little pitchy.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  I'm sketching.  I'm sketching.  Yeah, some people are reminding you that Hasselhoff is also massive in Europe.  Good point, good point.  Doesn't get much points to Europe.  Well, it's kind of weird, though, because, you know, one hit wonder over here, massive rock  stars over there.  Yeah.  All right.  What's the follow-up to that dumb song?  Sorry.  Every Window on My Thing Just Crashed.  Ah, that's the name of the song.  Is that it?  No, that's...  How did they know that computers are going to be so big and words like Crash?  They were visionaries. 
[02:29:30]  They went from comic strips to windows.  Wow.  The sun always shines on TV.  Wasn't that the fucking other one?  No, this was the one we started with, but we never got to it.  Oh.  So here it is to follow up to Take on Me.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Fucking ballad?  Yeah.  Every faggot has a soft side. 
[02:30:00]  Couple skate, couple skate.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Couple ska.  This kicking at any time?  You wouldn't know.  Good.  You're all man, Sam.  I knew it.  Travis, does this kick in?  See, I was...  Yeah.  I'm surprised we're asking him today. 
[02:30:30]  You're wearing the A-Ha concert shirt.  I know.  Oh, that's a weird note.  Sam's appreciating the gothic sound of the keyboard.  All right.  Something's going to happen here.  I feel like I'm shopping at Hot Topic.  Yeah.  Yeah, now we're dancing.  Jimmy's dancing.  Ooh.  Nice.  This is an 80s movie montage music.  Yes.  Montage. 
[02:31:00]  See Tony Montana buying Gina the fucking hair salon?  Yeah, yeah, this is it.  Take it to the limits.  Take it to the limits.  Give me that.  This is absolutely 80s montage music.  It is.  All right, enough, Phil.  Thanks.  Sorry, Kenny.  That song wasn't even close to take on me.  Don't take my new bit, Jimmy.  That's my...  I won't.  I want that.  Hurry up!  Give it to me.  What are you doing?  Why am I last online?  Thank you, Kenny. 
[02:31:30]  How come you didn't help Ralphie out?  He's like, yes.  No, I didn't want anything.  All right.  I didn't want anything.  Thank you.  Last thing I want is all the guys on the web to go, look, Fatty's eating again.  No, I don't want to say that.  I don't want to say that.  Are you kidding me?  That's the top thing they would say.  That'd be the nicest thing they'd say.  Look at Fatty at the trough.  I don't think they would do that.  Might be in a private room where you can't see.  All right.  What do we got there, Phan?  Next up is Iron Butterfly. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, Inagata Davida.  Oh, Inagata Davida.  Inagata Davida, baby.  Let's play the whole thing, man.  Sure.  Let's just take the morning off.  Yeah, fuck it.  What time is it?  Yeah, baby.  Here we go.  That's a revolution, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Can someone put some acid in my smoothie?  If you are.  Man.  If I'd have become better prepared.  Inagata Davida.  Oh, man.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Dude.  Oh, no.  Inagata Davida, baby.  Inagata Davida, baby.  Seems like Stray Parker.  Or is it Matt at the phone?  Which one does the singing?  Yeah.  Inagata Davida, baby.  Alabama man.  All right.  We get the point.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  How long is that fucking song, by the way?  Depends what version. 
[02:33:00]  This version's eight minutes, uh, 18 seconds.  Eight minutes.  You fucking drug-addicted shitheads.  Who sings that?  Iron Butterfly.  Iron Butterfly.  I think the original version's 17 minutes or something, right?  It's the radio edit.  It's eight minutes.  Wow.  It's eight minutes.  Yeah.  There's a whole side of it.  It's a wrap.  Let's go.  What's the follow-up to Inagata Davida?  Inagata.  Good.  What is this?  Do we know the name?  We're going to get a Sandlot reference.  Soul Experience.  Oh, yeah.  Soul Experience. 
[02:33:30]  Must be a song about rape.  Why?  Soul.  I don't know.  Oh, because you think it's because it involves black people?  Or even S-O-L-E because you kick her before you rip her.  Just a cheap black joke I was trying for.  They seem to be the easiest ones to do. 
[02:34:00]  I sort of remember this song, no?  Not at all.  Listen to the hook.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  What is a spinal tap?  And oh, how they dance the little children of Stonehenge. 
[02:34:30]  It sucks ass.  I'm waiting for some Jim Morrison poetry over that.  Yeah, groovy.  That's the worst.  All right, we get it.  You know, I have never seen Spinal Tap from beginning to end.  Oh, my God.  I swear I have it, too.  I bought it, so I want to see it.  Run, don't walk.  Oh.  And go get that movie.  Tell them.  Any more we want to go for?  You just say when.  We got Thomas Dolby.  I know a lot of Thomas Dolby.  She Blinded Me With Science was a big one.  Yeah, but then he did have a second one that was a semi-hit. 
[02:35:00]  No, was that it?  One of my submarines.  I don't think that was it.  Is missing.  No.  That's what we have.  I don't know.  No.  I got the follow-up, right?  Yeah.  I don't think that was the follow-up.  Give him a little listen.  What else?  Thomas Dolby actually had a couple others.  This is Nakamura.  You're beautiful.  Woo-oh, woo-oh, woo-oh, woo-oh.  She Blinded Me.  I hated this in the 80s. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, my God.  This was huge.  I know.  Miss Yakamoto, you're beautiful.  You're beautiful.  Certain VJs on MTV would play this shit, and they would never play, like, fucking Aussie  videos.  Like Martha Quinn.  This was the new sound.  I know.  Scions.  I was yelling at you.  I was a boy.  You were just a young boy.  I was scared of the change.  All right.  We got this song. 
[02:36:00]  So, you want to play one of my submarines?  Yeah.  What the fuck was that about, by the way?  You could sing about anything in the world, and you're talking about a submarine missing?  What the fuck does this mean?  But I don't think this was the hit.  Follow-up.  I don't know, but I really want to do drugs right now.  They would help.  It's a lot of good drug music.  Hyperactive.  Very good.  Thank you, Dave, from 6 to 8.  That was it.  That was probably the follow-up. 
[02:36:30]  Hyperactive was the follow-up.  This is what Dan was playing back in the day on his multiple-level keyboard.  Did you have the keyboard guitar?  Yes, when I was 6.  I was digging regularly.  All right, let's wrap this up with one real good cheesy 80s follow-up.  Do you want hyperactive?  No.  No.  All right.  We figured it out on our own. 
[02:37:00]  We don't need the listeners to actually know what it sounds like.  We're still looking up.  No, I don't care.  All right.  Fuck them.  You might be on something, though.  They teach you to bring everyone into the conversation.  Make them feel like you're talking to them personally.  Let's put up pictures of our average listener.  Yeah.  In front of us.  So we can know who they're talking to.  I'm on a no-armed burn victim.  What did y'all mean with a consultant?  Is that why you're talking like this?  What?  Adult school.  What happened?  Adult school?  Like, you have to focus on your listeners? 
[02:37:30]  Yup.  Like that?  Some PDs would make you take a picture and put them in front of you so you could know  who you're talking to.  So when you're doing your break, you could actually look at somebody.  Did Brother Weez make you do that?  No, man.  No.  Brother Weez is one of the cool ones.  Yeah.  We had a PD in Boston, and we actually had to make a profile of the average listener  listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  What kind of job he had, what kind of chick he had, what kind of car he drove. 
[02:38:00]  Remember that, eh?  What a douchebag.  This guy had a whole profile.  Like we were profiling for a listener.  Right.  All I wanted to do, I wish it was the future.  I'd have put a picture of Tub Girl up there.  Yeah.  Here's who we're talking to.  This fucking brown mud geyser.  Like we were the FBI all of a sudden.  We're profilers.  We're just trying to fucking make a living playing some stupid records.  Leave us alone.  Yeah.  Leave us alone.  Wears clown makeup.  Likes children. 
[02:38:30]  Has a Chicago accent.  Yeah.  Buys a lot of lye down at Home Depot.  He used to get so excited because we'd get all the answers right.  Like he was surprised.  I'm like, I don't know.  He's probably between 18 and 25.  Oh, good, good, good, good.  No shit, Sherlock.  What do you think I was going to say?  52-year-old balding guy?  Or how about the truth?  He's a 15-year-old snot-nosed fucking kid.  Because that's what we saw everywhere we went. 
[02:39:00]  All imitating Kurt Cobain.  That's who we talked to.  So, shut up.  Shut up is right.  One more?  What do you got, Dan?  We're looking for one more.  We have Meredith Brooks in the meantime.  I know you're looking for 80s.  She did the song Bitch.  I don't like the lyrics.  Remember her?  I'm a bitch.  I'm a liar.  I'm a punt.  I'm a bunker.  This is the follow-up? 
[02:39:30]  This is the original.  I hate the world today.  You're so good to me.  I know that I can't change.  Hey, I'm stupid.  Tried to tell you, but you look at me like maybe I'm an angel.  I get it.  You're empowering.  Yeah.  Look out, everyone.  Stand aside.  Yesterday I cried.  Must have been relieved to see the softest side.  Yeah.  I can understand how you'd be so confused. 
[02:40:00]  I don't envy you.  They say dice all over the world, just like screaming.  Yeah, you go, girl.  You tell them.  Come on.  I'm a bitch.  I'm a lover.  I'm a child.  I'm a mother.  I'm a sinner.  She can do it all.  That's right.  That chick can rock.  She can cook, fuck, and fight her.  There's nothing in the truth.  Yeah.  Wouldn't want it any other way.  How about I punch you in the fucking eye and we see how you... 
[02:40:30]  See how many things come off your fucking list.  I'm a cunt.  I'm a bore.  I'm a blemish.  I'm the workforce.  I'm a shitty driver.  I'm a toilet plogger with tampons.  Yeah.  I ran out of awful things.  That's awesome.  No.  Why would you? 
[02:41:00]  I'm an anchor.  I'm a killjoy.  I'm a...  The follow-up is, I'm alone raising these kids.  I shouldn't have fucked the NBA player.  The follow-up is, why are you wrapping me in a tarp and throwing me overboard?  I'm a bitch.  I'm barnacle food. 
[02:41:30]  Do you want the actual follow-up?  Oh, now we need to hear it.  What's the follow-up to bitch?  What would happen?  What would happen?  Right now I would turn the channel.  That's what would happen.  Click.  Oh.  There.  Electricity. 
[02:42:00]  I...  Do I...  Hey, don't I know you...  This is big in the strip clubs.  This song?  Yeah.  You've heard this?  Yeah.  Rugged?  Rugged clubs, yeah.  No, no.  Slow call?  The girls would come out and crawl out.  Oh, gotcha.  The crawl.  The crawl.  Do they act like they're writhing in pain?  Right.  You wish they were?  You wish they were. 
[02:42:30]  I can't even make sense of this.  Yeah.  All right, enough of this.  You speak and I don't hear you.  Thank you.  This is...  It's a good bit, though.  It has potential.  Yeah, I like it.  I like it, too.  It gets a little nostalgia in there.  Yeah.  Makes people remember.  I remember that song.  And then it shows how shitty the artists were.  We didn't pick the best songs, though.  I mean, we got to get those real crazy one-hit wonder hits from the 80s.  I think we need a good firing.  Okay. 
[02:43:00]  We have an English...  Jeez.  Sorry.  80s.  He's talking in my ear.  An 80s hit.  Modern English.  See, we can't even prove that went on.  Yeah.  Modern English?  That's going to be my new thing.  Modern English.  Every time I flub, I'm going to go, oh, I'm sorry.  Someone was talking.  Someone was talking.  Who was that?  That's a good one.  No, no.  I was distracted.  Why would I take responsibility?  And Bill won't object.  He'll just look thin-lipped and angry.  I actually have used that one.  By the way.  Utah mall shooting. 
[02:43:30]  What?  I'll be in the middle of some dumb, stupid story that I'm lost in, and I'll also go,  what?  I'll go, oh, I got distracted.  Somebody on the phone.  I've done that one before many times.  Actually, some fan.  I'm in good company.  What do you got?  This is Modern English.  They did Melt With You.  Stopped the World.  Yes.  They used to play this song three times as you went and saw them in concert.  We did, really?  I saw them warm up for some, but I can't remember anymore. 
[02:44:00]  They played it three times.  And I think the third time was our long version.  Yeah, the extended version.  I know they follow up to this, too.  I swear to God, I didn't look.  Something, the follow up to this is something, uh, uh, hands across, or across hands, or,  or, uh, across America.  Bill's shaking his head. 
[02:44:30]  It's not what our sources say.  Uh, um, oh, uh, I know this, though.  No, you don't.  Uh, uh, shit.  Land.  What?  Fuck.  Um, the back of rates.  What is it?  I'll start the world back up.  Across the ocean.  And freeze?  Damn it.  Do they have a song called Across the Ocean?  They should all be just the reverse of the title of the original.  Like, like, maybe Nana's is 66 Luftballons, because she just turned the numbers upside 
[02:45:00]  down.  Give me those ribs.  All right, what is it?  Um, after the snow.  Ooh.  Luca lives in the basement.  Wow, I don't know this.  She abuses people upstairs, old people.  I hate the sound of this shit.  Yeah, this was so much better than, uh, a guitar. 
[02:45:30]  Huh?  How'd they get away with, like, throwing the guitar away in the 80s?  Putting that ridiculous keyboard fucking synth shit in there.  The guitar was replaced by this awful keyboard in the 80s.  All right.  There was just, uh, and any movie in the 80s just gets dated the second that music kicks  in.  Doesn't matter how good the movie is.  That and the big cell phone.  Giant.  That's the late 80s. 
[02:46:00]  God, I was watching something as recent as, uh, as recent, but relatively speaking, the  X-Files movie was on, and they pull out, like, bricks with antennas on them.  Like, talking into them.  It's like, what the fuck is that, a Vietnam fucking field phone?  We've got Charlie in the wire.  Yeah.  Someone's cranking something a few yards away.  Charlie's in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  It's a lovely fucking war.  Yeah.  What about this one?  I don't have an exact movie, but they'll, uh, they'll open up their cell phone, and 
[02:46:30]  to look cool, they'll pull the antenna out.  The antenna.  Look at me.  High tech is what I'm all about.  Like, I think Scully would always, like, pull it out with her teeth.  Yeah.  Right, right, right.  Like, that was cool.  And then it's like, what is that?  Oh, an antenna.  We used to have those on phones.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Forget.  Big block of a phone, too.  I was watching, um, Lethal Weapon, and every time something bad happened, they would do  that guitar lick.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's nothing more 80s than that guitar lick. 
[02:47:00]  That's horrible, yeah.  When, you know, he's throwing into the water, and he looks over at his girl, and she's floating  in his leather jacket.  Yeah.  It is an awful little, uh, indicator that something bad happened.  Yes.  Sadness time.  Nothing beats the, um, Lone Wolf McQuaid, though.  uh that was a movie with uh chuck uh norris was in that and whenever anything would happen 
[02:47:30]  uh there'd be whistling  and his wolf died and they killed his friends his fucking like wife his kid everyone died and he  was like trying to keep the peace but they killed his fucking wolf and that's the line that's when  he went all right i'll kill my fucking friend my partner this guy that but my wolf and he's  standing there looking at his sunset like and the whistling started up and then he just went on a 
[02:48:00]  killing spree now we got a problem you kill my fucking wolf now now i'm pissed now we're rocking  now i'm now we're rocking uh ralphie where are you gonna be i'm uh this weekend i'm at uh poughkeepsie  uh bananas on friday and hasbrookite bananas on uh saturday very very good that's uh full of  bananas all right lines up bananas all right we'll see you guys tomorrow  what what happened qf in a goddess and go now we'll we'll be back i promise we got a couple more

[02:49:00]  fucking manoli thing you cringe when you listen to the replay though it's like because i've done it  so many times too we pay attention we don't pay attention to everything everyone says so someone  will say a line and then if opie does something like that and reiterates what we're playing a little  later uh you throw the same line out the guy looks at you like i said that like 15 minutes ago and  then you listen to the replay and the part comes up and you're like oh no that's funny though it is 
[02:49:30]  very best part is that i'm stealing them i'm just hoping that no one remembers no one yeah oh i  completely know you said it earlier i'm just you ever listen to the replay and you know uh it's coming  up where you're just completely just we're off we're bombing and you gotta turn it off once you  throw it on ethel or something or top tracks like just what are you doing ah i had just  yeah you know i don't i i don't feel like they don't want to listen to this anymore yeah or if  you know a part's coming up where you're you killed you like all of a sudden just casually start 
[02:50:00]  turning up a little listen to this listen to this part here or you talk loudly if it's one bad line  or two bad lines yeah my girlfriend will be in the car and so it's old and here comes the gem like  and then i said so honey you want out the window oh there's a starbucks yeah and then she's like what  i mean you know nothing i'm nothing it's just yeah yeah  why the traffic today has been a little rough try to cover up your stupid line yeah oh look let's uh

[02:58:00]  up here so let's uh start with some mike tyson the guy got bumped from letterman man why is that a good  sign well it depends on what he got bumped for i mean was it bumped for a major news story  he's a guy that makes toothpick sculptures true is that what it is yeah the guy who uses tongue  depressors bumped him wait a minute does seinfeld have another disc releasing this week yeah did  kramer go off on some chinese rant he's a chink all right let's hear my tyson oh yeah oh no more soda pop 
[02:58:30]  oh come on  what are you chewing on oh that a boy oh no oh no oh shit oh no all right oh no the distinct  pingy sound ping sound how much money of a dodgeball how much money do i have on me today 
[02:59:00]  i think this deserves a fist that's your camera we want a fist we want something that's a little  different than the usual what uh what type of sculpture is it does he have is it uh the white  house or was he gonna be up here soon where is he there was one on his card i guess it's only one  we saw so where is he sort of a fabergé egg i think he's coming out from downstairs fabergé egg  yes type uh thing made out of how long did it take him to make it probably we'll find out all 
[02:59:30]  this stuff it's pretty interesting fascinating this is impromptu guest day i think ramon might have to  uh yeah well i don't know i don't know yellowstone might go out we'll see we'll feel it out i think i  know your throat probably his throat probably hurts from yesterday yeah i can't stay in character  stuff how ron and fez do it so easily  i got a i got a quickie  a 10 year old girl is arrested and charged with assault and battery after a brawl inside a 
[03:00:00]  dorchester target police it went by really fast this is a 10 year old girl oh you did hear that  part yeah sure that's what got my dick hard  a 10 year old girl is arrested and charged with assault and battery after a brawl inside a  dorchester target police say the fight broke out when a 22 year old woman accidentally bumped into  the young girl witnesses say the victim was kicked over and over in the head and stomach  that's just saddens me i guess that to hear something like that to know that violence is the first 
[03:00:30]  reaction to you know something so minor target says it's working with boston police to help resolve  the matter the victim was treated and released from a boston hospital as for the young girl she faces  criminal charges 10 how do you beat a 10 year old beat up a 20 year old how's a 22 year old let a 10  year old beat you up oh dorchester she's 10 in ghetto years yeah i know that's that's gotta be a little 
[03:01:00]  different fine kindergarten age in life yeah what they didn't say is that that 22 year old lady like  stepped on two of her babies the 10 year old babies yeah what happened you know mama bear and all step on  my baby my child that's my child ghetto years is a real thing by the way it really is steve where's  toothpick guy uh... wait what are we waiting for what are we waiting for he's got to fill out the paperwork 
[03:01:30]  gentleman i did hear something uh pretty racist about um black uh girls in puberty why they they enter  puberty earlier and people said it is because of all the hormones that are put in chicken and the  fact that they eat so much chicken i think that's happening with everybody is it yeah with uh milk milk and  chicken chicken and beef and all that stuff yeah yeah yeah i just heard about the chicken and i found it funny 
[03:02:00]  hilarious it's very funny hormones and fucking in grape soda  yeah grape soda and cheetos  uh i think a watermelon  let's go to uh a trucker  a trucker okay trucker trucker are you named trucker  uh i'd just rather use that as my name i'm calling you just with a word of caution okay okay  as a marine corps sniper you're taught to make two thick sculptures to steady your hand 
[03:02:30]  if you fuck up this guy's sculpture there is no telling what he will go to all right so you're  saying that perhaps because he does this he's could be a marine corps sniper because one of the  snipers uh training i guess is is to make these things which would probably steady your hand uh  working with little toothpicks teaches you to exercise your breathing etc right oh i never knew  that were you a sniper sir yes sir ah okay we're looking at this guy i'm a working man were you ever in 
[03:03:00]  the shit this guy uh it doesn't look like he's a it looks like he's taking a two a few shots to the  head himself he's been sniped in the head a few times a few loads if you know what i mean he's from  the face or fanny division yeah that's right we're saying he's queer you don't want this guy out of  pose reach that's all i'm saying all right well you don't know it's not everybody that sculpts toothpicks 
[03:03:30]  exactly sniper my friend sometimes you're just a faggot i'm sure some people on the court like to  crochet does that mean we should never attack an old woman with needles she might be a  fucking marine uh where's this guy uh poor guy who's going to be on letterman and now he's uh  going to be part of this disaster that's i don't want to learn about this guy i want to see how he  was booked on letterman where is he do you got a bio it's coming i need a bio his art was well

[03:06:30]  that's a shame oh no but uh he was so eager the uh yeah the late show people were kind enough to fly  him out to tape this segment and then uh didn't air his segment so we stuck in new york for a few  more and what was he just walking around manhattan and who saw him i saw him across the street at duane  reed uh he was showing people his photos of him with biff henderson oh right and from the uh 
[03:07:00]  apparently he made a big um a big piece of biff henderson in toothpick art really so he was showing  the uh and that was probably every guy the people at the photo center that was probably what he was  going to show on on david letterman uh during the taped segment and they never aired it no  are they gonna air it at some point you didn't explain why they didn't air it well this is these  are all the questions we'll be able to hey uh bio there it is all right read away read away

[03:08:30]  great and uh what happened oh turn his headphones up yeah what happened was uh i was filming yeah  and we did uh you know the rehearsal and everything was going fine and it kind of ran out of time  oh it's okay nah being bumped from something like that you're so excited to be there and everything  you know but it it's good experience and uh yeah every minute why didn't they air your segment what  happened uh they ran out of time oh what exactly is it that you do like how did this 
[03:09:00]  come about how did you learn were you ever in the military like how did you learn toothpick art no  um basically what i did uh was i started creating a dna molecule out of beans and toothpicks in the  second grade for a science project and then i got into uh cable cars and all sorts of things but i  could show you wow what i do here you uh that's cool oh you do do some kind of abstract that actually  reminds me of when i was a kid and i set up my hot wheels track with a little loop well this one's 
[03:09:30]  called sidetracked sidetracked yeah it's sort of like a looping uh track thing made out of toothpicks  right and uh how long would one of these take you they take weeks three weeks three to four weeks  last uh march through may i had a solo exhibition in the lobby of the empire state building really  and i've got and you included we've seen your uh empire state building on your website yeah you  already checked that's very impressive how long did that take oh that one took four months i'd imagine  four months yeah everyone could see the artwork online at toothpickart.com sure we'll we'll send 
[03:10:00]  a lot of people there today well why us you heard about our show well actually um if i can tell you  how it happened i met eric uh at a game bar no  eric uh eric's been known to be sidetracked to once or twice he doesn't keep his private life  private eric and we know we you know it's that's all i met him at duane reed pharmacy across street  i was making photos of me and biff uh-huh and uh he overheard me talking about late show yeah hey my 
[03:10:30]  buddy that's his mo he's a ventriloquist i said oh okay yeah i said by the way i'm in town if you  want have me come over i'll do your show that's how that's his line on guys he's used that one  over at duane reed plenty of time so feel flattered believe me that's all right yeah so where's your  art with you or no yeah oh oh oh what happened what what what oh no no no no no video no video of 
[03:11:00]  your art why not of this piece because this is the one that was supposed to air they said if i show it  then i won't be able to get back on oh my god this is a biff that is a toothpick rendering of biff  yeah out of uh 32 toothpicks and glue just 32 on the uh do you have any wow that's cool yeah so this  is just uh i use the needle nose pliers to bend the toothpicks did you i use a straight edge raised  blade to trim the ends and then i glue them down just with glue do you do you use some kind of water  to bend them no um believe it or not my goodness actually crimp the toothpicks and i get to the 
[03:11:30]  curve that i want to very smooth curve of his his domed head would you say like i mean i mean i  used to draw when i was a kid if you had to take to distinguish between that and drawing i mean would  you typically want to like is for you is it more of something that you would say sketch or is it  perhaps no um it's something because of that right now but what create so it looks like the actual  rendering um and that's the main thing because dude you're holding up a toothpick of a guy's head 
[03:12:00]  actually it looks a little like jimmy norton exactly i don't have a toothpick on his nose  jimmy can you hold that up in the air for me so i can see it i don't trust myself holding up  no toothpick on that's good so how long did that take you to do this one usually takes between about  eight nine hours eight and nine hours to do that right right and did he have to sit for you or do  you have a picture i i worked off a photo a photo right and it's pretty accurate uh representation 
[03:12:30]  yeah it's got to be priceless at this point well who knows yeah let me um but i've done one of like  president you're dead you're dead yeah let's put that away do you have any with you really yeah  i mean i i mean the actual things uh no i actually was here uh just for you know six days just right  letterman deal and then wow i might like i said before i had a show in the lobby the empire state  building last march through may i had all my work there hey uh can i get a picture with biff uh yeah 
[03:13:00]  i would like that jimmy could you hold up the picture of biff well i mean i want to get a picture  wow well if you don't mind we'll hold off on that for a moment why uh i could explain why they  told me not to use any images of this if i want to get back on the show so oh you don't want to  yeah i hear you then i won't be able to get back on the show i hear you you want to get back on what  if it's a picture for my personal collection well how about if we take a picture of something else  that i have here no because those are just pictures oh well you know what maybe i can make  i got some toothpicks in the hotel room maybe i can make you while i'm here  here that'd be interesting could you make sam like actual weight yeah out of three toothpicks 
[03:13:30]  why not if you if you made i want a picture with biff how about we take a picture of opie  and you can make one of opie and then you come back in and then we could take pictures of that  i can't have a picture with biff yeah unfortunately not not a bit but how about me no oh no i want a  picture with biff well you know what maybe we can work this out somehow oh and can you work it out 
[03:14:00]  yeah no i can't work anything out what am i the uh diplomat what if i promise i wouldn't give the  picture to the papers or anything uh on our website i can't do that because they told me not to put the  photograph on my website so we'll lay low on that right now strict rules yeah well i don't feel like  talking oh don't be grumpy don't be mr grumpy but on on that you interview this yes sir on a positive 
[03:14:30]  note yeah um don't look at me i don't care oh he's hurt he gets very he's very very testy if you  give me a photo of yourself yeah i'll make the piece i want a picture with biff oh okay but what  were you going to say about the um uh basically everyone can again visit my art online at toothpick  art.com yeah i can create anything out of toothpicks i can create anything can you anything that's great 
[03:15:00]  if the price is right i'll do it the price is right people actually pay okay these pieces range like  would you say that you go by the hour or is it something that you charge by the size or is it  something that you charge by the difficulty or is it something that you charge um it's a combination of  all three um basically how long it takes the subject matter really what is going to be used  do you know beforehand like like say say someone to commission something yeah for example i did one 
[03:15:30]  of lou dobbs i did one of lou dobbs with cnn um i was commissioned by a new york executive lou dobbs  yeah of course how much would that empire state building go for that's 25 000 25 000  wow how many toothpicks are in there uh seven thousand four hundred and seventy let's do some  math that would be about three thousand dollars a toothpick mm-hmm about yeah maybe who knows yeah  well how's your am i right can we see that band help me can we see the biff again sure yeah let's 
[03:16:00]  see the three dollars a toothpick yeah three dollars times seven i was saying three thousand dollars a  toothpick wow i'm an idiot jimmy how does the biff feel like you could feel like oh i don't know i  wouldn't trust myself yeah what do you what kind of glue do you use uh just regular elmer just yeah  you got it okay i'll give him a plug oh why not he's elmer's glue yeah so this is  crafts how do you keep it so clean on that black background you don't glue all over yeah it would be 
[03:16:30]  all like boy i've been doing a long long time i think have you what what you do is you put a very small  amount of glue yeah and and then you kind of smear it with your finger uh-huh and that's that's how  it works that's really hold on two uh seconds okay i just have to okay cole that's okay these guys  are co-hosts they know how to do this thank you where are you going um out here i i don't i'm not  artistic uh when i was a boy i would steven i think it's funny that steven seems pretty confused why 
[03:17:00]  are you confused steven uh i'm not confused i'm here i'm having a good old time yeah how long you  been doing toothpick art i've been doing toothpick art for 35 years oh my god how old are you you look  young 40 you look much younger oh so you started five i started when i was five wow so just like  crafts like have you ever like diverted into like a macaroni stage uh no i usually well people tell me  you know stick with the toothpicks if you're if you're lucky with them and if you've been yeah you got 
[03:17:30]  it right just keep on going with it right right right man so do you guys have a project for me  is there anything that you i mean maybe we could take out a steak and start popping it with toothpicks  or something i actually dude i actually hold on um what do we got out there we got i'll be right  back um we got we want we want to get is how many can you get interns um how many people can you do on  one paper like on one i mean i could do probably four or five i've done the early show from cbs there are  five people how long would that take you it takes a while like one two hold on two seconds two seconds 
[03:18:00]  one two three  i don't know man you know dude yeah i like it the uh the whole toothpick thing i do like it  do you ever use the other backgrounds besides just black uh no i just use black to kind of show the  detail because if it were on like white you wouldn't be able to see it oh sorry sorry yeah 
[03:18:30]  so you wouldn't be able to see it if it was just on white right right oh man that stinks i know  that's horrible so um this is the funniest thing um wow yeah radio's not easy is it folks no um wow  did they leave you in the cold here or what yeah yeah this is the uh this is the torture i uh i'm curious 
[03:19:00]  uh so uh why did you pick biff uh because david letterman people do him all the time yeah and uh  they thought have you done day letter i did david letterman you want to see him yeah yeah here we go  of course is he available on your website he's on my website oh so so you start in with dave i  actually the first one i ever did was a dave letterman picking his teeth with a toothpick  and then from dave i got into like president bush and tiger woods barry bonds uh billy crystal and 
[03:19:30]  then i did one of biff because i i wanted to get on the show so i thought if i do one of biff might  be a good way of getting on the late show with david letterman so not doing letterman wasn't enough  to get you on right you had to bring in i had to bring in biff unbelievable yeah wow have you ever  thought about doing leno uh i've thought about them but i've never a lot of toothpicks oh man to do  the chin right i think it would take quite a few what was that i don't know i don't know but uh 
[03:20:00]  man are we on or yeah so could you do one of anna nicole smith i can can you do one of her skinny and  fat and then fatty and then skinny again yeah i can then like uh uh dead again yeah whatever you want  all right that's good i think i'd like one of those yeah if i was going to commission guys if i was  going to commission uh a uh toothpick could you do one of a barack obama i could do one of yeah easy 
[03:20:30]  but like like so it would just look like a puerto rican i don't think so i think i could get some  good details out of them really uh-huh ah this computer i would die well you're not going to  commission one ralph you know if you could do five guys on one i don't know if i could take five guys  me on one it might be too much it's too busy yeah i don't think so oh no why so quiet yeah what's 
[03:21:00]  going on here nobody's talking yeah i'm trying to get my computer to work  no it's back here no the laptop adult you always have problems that piece of shit no no  there it is five people on the same paper all right sure oh the laptop so uh what happened 
[03:21:30]  nothing what happened what did we brought the show to a screeching halt dude i was out finding guys  i want i got him and him and i want bill and i want we want five of the guys the under guys yeah  so guys what's going on what happened to the biff  the biff was just they put it away he put it away he had it up the whole time he just can't have it  he gets mad can't have it i don't i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to before how much would i sell 
[03:22:00]  them for i got a couple here you have more than one biff yeah oh how much would you sell it for oh it  depends how much it's worth it i actually don't know i mean i'm asking yeah i don't know these pieces  are about two grand for uh two celebrities are two grand and then for uh but like biff's not a  celebrity oh that's pretty good yeah no wait let's see what you get for two grand 
[03:22:30]  that's it's nice do you get like a letter of authenticity that's pretty nice authentic what  well it's obviously the guys i don't know what to ask about toothpick art i i'm not artistic um  um it's like two grand is a lot of money okay so let's let's make a deal no no no it's not that  i want to buy i don't know who biff is oh i've done one of george bush um i've been do you have  that with you i have it on my website actually toothpickart.com jimmy look at the biff and see if 
[03:23:00]  you would just you know pay two thousand dollars for that i'll look what i like about them is you  can see where he puts the little marks to make it bend that's pretty cool if you look close really  yeah it has all the detail i mean Pablo Picasso was good at that making like curves i know right  see you get a bit of toothpick artist like uh can i see the can i see the curves on the real one i  won't touch it i don't want to touch it my hands i've been whacking my bag 
[03:23:30]  there it is wow how do you get to bend dude turn around i use a needle nose pliers dude yeah  i use a needle nose pliers and toothpicks and every time i crimp the toothpick you'll see like a little  don't you just break toothpicks left and right oh uh no i use a basically i use a straight edge  razor blade to trim the toothpicks and i use a needle nose pliers to bend them it's a lot harder than it  actually looks by looking at the piece it doesn't look like it takes a lot of time but actually now 
[03:24:00]  definitely it's a lot you have to wet them first no i don't wet them i just need i just use a needle nose  pliers if you crimp them close enough i guess you get a nice smooth arc exactly yeah what does  crimp mean crimp meaning to like bend something to like pinch it but how do you pinch it with a  razor i wish i had a toothpick here to show you and you know oh that toothpick guy doesn't have a  toothpick he's got some toothpicks and just like how do you not have a hotel room so you have to travel  with toothpicks yeah you rock will go with you yeah yeah but um like i said before i make these line 
[03:24:30]  drawings and they're they're very popular people love them because they look they bring people  happiness yeah and people can relate to them because they know what they're looking at i mean  maybe sometimes abstract oh we got toothpicks oh man good job now open it up and show like where you  would like make sure or something okay like show the picture how do you do crimping he's gonna i don't  know how to crimp you go like this i'm gonna pretend i'm crimping with my pliers but i'm gonna use the 
[03:25:00]  you're using uh your nails let me try it with another toothpick i'm gonna try crimping too  hey maybe you know what you guys have given me a good idea maybe i'll get away from the needle  of those pliers and just use my finger why not so here we go all right hold on how's mine hey you're  hired yeah mine didn't come out too bad no mine's not doing you you're a better crimper than i am see  what you do is you kind of give it a but that doesn't look anything like the biff i mean it'll look 
[03:25:30]  like them when i'm done sure i'm not a good crimper see you just kind of i'm not a good crimper  i made the i was trying to crimp it and it wasn't i didn't look at mine  uh no you're doing fine i made the gold i'm not very good at this yeah oh you're great at that  it's like i broke my right we're learning all about i made the golden gate bridge  today on the opening anthony show yeah i mean you made the golden gate bridge is 13 feet long  there was a very funny documentary about that recently i know about people coming too 
[03:26:00]  god with how did i laugh that was that yeah it wasn't the suicides that were fun it was like  just the family reactions who's calling who keeps calling you're a busy guy i know big in demand  yeah i got a lot of calls who is that it's probably somebody with gunk in their teeth they  can't find anything to pick it out wait he's taking a phone call i got a piece of chicken  can you send some art over he's taking a phone call during our show sure luke  we're out in two countries countries i need you all right 
[03:26:30]  so here we are yeah all right so what's uh you married man uh no a single cool oh we can't take  pictures we're looking no unfortunately we can't how about if you promise not to put him on a  website if you want i can't do that guys he wants to get back on the show yeah i want to get back on  the show totally yeah i don't blame you for you don't want tv baby tv yeah but you guys are hot i mean  look i just came into a great show let's how many bits do you have huh how many bits i have uh 30 
[03:27:00]  three bits but all different versions obviously because you didn't know what version they wanted for the  the segment so yeah right so which other one i'm smart oh i i actually created a larger piece uh the  other one is smaller and then i created one on like a paper do you when you when you create something  do you ever just kind of say look like when you do like the abstract art or the other stuff do you  ever say like i just kind of want to create something but i'm not exactly like it's not you know like 
[03:27:30]  i i don't have like all right this is a definable goal or right you know well you know because of  that yeah i mean sometimes for example i used to make just cable cars for many years oh my god  you are a busy man you're a busy busy artist i'll let it go i'll let it go yeah let it go yeah  um basically i've worked on pieces before just for example like cable cars recreating different sizes and 
[03:28:00]  i got involved with the fine arts museums in san francisco right a lady there was saying you know  why don't you use your imagination and create things that are out of the norm why create things that are  existing why not sure use your imagination to create abstract that's how i got into abstract  you ever do uh like dirty art just for a goof like a maple thorpe out of uh size queen yeah i've  thought about it but uh you know it's funny big money like a huge like penis cock or something  yeah yeah i don't know about that yeah yeah clockwork orange that sculpture yeah yeah

[03:39:30]  used for this kind of stuff the other two computers aren't really used they've never been that reliable  no just because that time has an awful virus doesn't you know obviously it can't that one computer  can't do everything those other computers have never been really good at certain functions  what the fuck i know they've always shut down i'm trying to update them trying to update them  but when you network the three together and one starts antagonizing the other yeah that there's  those can those other two computers have always been you have computer problems or anything you use 
[03:40:00]  computers at all yeah i do you use computers for your art yeah i built the whole website myself oh you  did yeah oh okay you're you're very talented that's pretty cool mac or pc i did all the uh photography  i do all the uh news releases mac guy right release mac no actually pc oh i don't know yeah i'm gonna call  that really yeah well all right  that's something well just walking by good sync two computers this one's shot yeah this computer here 
[03:40:30]  the one right here that you're looking at obviously is shot obviously shot because uh i'm gonna have to  take it out of the studio if that other computer acts up yeah it's no good it's no good then there's  that one much lesser computer that kind of wants everything to work but it's scared  are you more calls uh plenty of calls wow hello so jimmy why don't you take a look 
[03:41:00]  oh you have the wrong number who's that no problem what was it rico what frederico man somebody got  your number dude i mean ramon frederico yeah a lot of spanish people here in new york spanish thing  all right there's i like spanish almost there all right well uh  see the one computer 
[03:41:30]  it tries to network with the other one  yet it doesn't want to connect dude that's a problem that's been going on for years the one  computer is completely ready and the other two computers just keep fucking it's the other one  yeah the other one's ready the other one's got the other two can't network in  we also do a tech show also yeah yeah they got two four let's get six  really good at the studio wow and uh can we just get a picture that's all i want obviously you 
[03:42:00]  you can tell something's going on here i just want a picture with the with the biff you got it right  there huh no i want to be in the picture with biff oh like you're like you got your arm around  them or something we were on letterman so when were you on letterman swear to god look it up uh  we could show you a video where can we show them the video of us on line in this it was great we  were on in uh december december no we no that was uh leno we were on leno as well you were on  letterman in august oh right there there you go weekday mornings our next guest can be heard on both cbs 
[03:42:30]  radio and xm satellite radio from the opian anthony show here's opian anthony that's the actual cue card  and then we we weren't bumped my friend we were brought out that's a shame i got pumped you know  what he wants i know what he wants too because we did this um you know that uh uh i know you can  do it with the uh stupid light light up light bright looking things and they thought they were bombs  yeah we got one of those and we took pictures of it uh like it was a real person you know to 
[03:43:00]  celebrity pictures you put your arm around them kind of a thing and i know he takes pictures with  everybody he's like celebrity hound how about a picture of me and you so come on what about this  guy what about but he wants like the biff picture like it's a real person you me and biff  look i'm cleaning my hands and everything because i know how valuable what do you want the photo  for what's what's up to put on the website i think i think it's pretty cool i think me and you  would be after what about like if we don't put it up on the website until after like when will you 
[03:43:30]  know if you're going to be on i would think they would let me know within the next week or two  week or two they're going to probably fly me out again that'll be holding it a long time i know  but but i have an idea what's your idea my idea is to take out the portfolio  and take pictures of us with the portfolio yeah but we want the actual art and uh we did give you a  lot of plugs on the show i mean i appreciate pictures of a picture but you know i promised the  guys i'd lay low with it until i get back on the air we know you put it online yeah but uh you know 
[03:44:00]  i mean that piece is actually a little different than what i've got here oh oh what's different  about it yeah it's a larger image of it i created this one in all fairness in all fairness they can't  really tell that so when they're saying don't show it they probably because the size is something  you really can't tell on a picture they probably just don't want you doing another tv show um yeah  i would assume well they said you know just lay low with it so that's why i promise i'd lay low  all right you guys understand i mean this is radio i mean we're using our voices they call it 
[03:44:30]  communicate yeah i know it's a fun show though i i'm very it is ridiculous isn't it i mean it's  great i mean i've never been in a room with the like uh six guys talking on the radio it's not  talking on the radio it's just six guys talking on the radio have you ever met a too thick artist  before that's no i have no without a cracker in the middle oh man so overall what do you think of  the art i think it's pretty cool i think it's pretty damn cool it's uh yeah original thank 
[03:45:00]  you very much like that empire state building thank you i appreciate it all right something  labor of love all right ah labor of love so there's a lot of labor it's like what we do here  well i mean look someone has a full-time job they'd like to make 50 grand a year and why not make  all money doing art all right yeah oh this damn thing are you still having computer glitches  over there constant oh many of your videos are opening what happened just the past few videos 
[03:45:30]  not all right should we thank steve for coming in or what oh absolutely thank you very much for  having me on the show it's been an honor sir thank you so much thank you and a continued success thank  you and best of luck thank you so much with you why i'm too big everybody go i'll say i'm just  getting we're in break all right we're in break thank you very much all right sorry about that that  was cool it was just i signed an agreement they say don't do it so yeah it's all right yeah that happens  was it was okay for the error so far yeah it was it was kind of boring to be honest with you 
[03:46:00]  yeah because we uh well not that it didn't suck or anything it wasn't like that it was boring because  you didn't we thought you had more pieces like we thought you had like the empire stout i mean  i was just in the pharmacy all i had was oh yeah yeah yeah no no no but you have like i'd be more  than happy to fly out with pieces i mean if you want it take care of the trip i'll come out here  i'll do whatever you want yeah anything yeah have me make pamela lee i'll do anything you want  pamela lee who's that pamela anderson oh pamela anderson nah she's not but i could do you guys 
[03:46:30]  know she's not hot fly me out she used to be put me that's a straight guys like  what airline they fly out america would have a realistic yellow hue i know coach like yeah  that would be the person a gay guy would point out as like someone that's hot oh yeah you know  i know you saw something i'll get in a lot of trouble if i was gay and i wanted to make believe  i'm not i'd go oh that pamela anderson is a hot broad you know yeah that would be that that would  be the example i would use just to throw off the scent in the room you know i've never heard a phone
