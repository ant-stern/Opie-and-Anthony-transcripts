<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a phone interview with an Elvis impersonator (“King”) promoting a CD of covers by deceased artists.  The hosts unsuccessfully attempted to convince him to perform in their bathroom, referencing Elvis’s death location.  They then played, and seemingly destroyed, his CD.  The show transitioned to a discussion of Derek Jeter vs. Mike Piazza’s attractiveness, fueled by a Daily News article, and included a crude phone call from “Mad Dog” offering his opinion.

A substantial portion focused on playing audio from a previous show featuring “Christian,” a “prude” from Oklahoma, who was punished for failing to appear topless and bring beer.  The punishment, orchestrated by staff member Rick, involved forcing her to watch a video of an elderly woman having sex.  The hosts and callers debated the ethics of Rick’s actions, with varied opinions expressed.  This segment featured audio of the hosts encouraging Rick’s actions.  The show concluded this section with a bizarre call from “Bill,” who claimed to be disoriented after a car accident, giving inconsistent locations including Disneyland and Jupiter.

The show continued with a discussion about perceptions of Harlem, marked by stereotypical and racially charged jokes from Opie and Anthony.  This segment included calls from a police officer who expressed fear driving home at night and Starks from Harlem who challenged the hosts' negative views.  A lengthy, offensive comedic bit featuring a fictional, crude Popeye character followed.

Next, Celine Dion's retirement announcement prompted a mocking reading of a listener's letter and an over-the-top, sexually suggestive Celine Dion impersonation by Anthony, referencing the Titanic.  The show then shifted to CB radio slang and Anthony recounted a disappointing CB radio date with “Dreamweaver,” whose online persona misrepresented her appearance.  The show briefly mentioned a "What's in My Pants" segment before moving on.  Their attempts to find a dark-skinned female caller for this segment were peppered with racially charged jokes.


The "Guess What's in My Pants" segment featured Laundra, dubbed the "first African princess" to play, rubbing a phone on her genitals while the hosts guessed the object. They ultimately guessed correctly.  The show then segued into graphic, offensive jokes about Sean Connery and spousal abuse.  This was followed by criticism of the MTV Movie Awards and Sarah Jessica Parker’s hosting, leading to a surprising call from Sarah Jessica Parker herself.  Initially angry, the conversation became amicable, with Parker inviting them to the *Sex and the City* set.  The show ended this section with more discussions about children's sexuality and crude humor, along with a rambling call from Arthur about losing his car.


A subsequent segment tackled children's sexuality, prompted by a news article about kindergarten sexual activity.  The hosts engaged in crude jokes, including a Barney-themed child molestation scenario.  “Spaz” shared his early sexual experiences, and the hosts discussed a perceived correlation between such incidents and less affluent neighborhoods.  The show then covered Otto and George’s negative experience on another radio show, followed by repeated playings and jokes about a song, "Insects," performed by "retarded children."  This sparked an angry exchange with a caller, “Denise,” who expressed outrage, resulting in a profanity-laced argument.  The hosts and George mocked Denise's complaints.  The segment continued with more calls, sexually explicit jokes, and insults.  Otto and George remained in studio throughout. The show concluded by playing and discussing OJ Simpson's new website, "askOJ.com," and its promotional video, followed by more vulgar jokes and banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  OP. What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going to change the station? That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  OP and Anthony. We've just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  1027. WNEW.  Oh. Yeah.  All right. I'm upstairs now with the king.  All right. With the king.  Yep.  All right. He's in our lobby. We're going to try to figure out if he's worthy enough to come down and hang with us today, Anthony.  All right.  All right. Here he is. 
[00:00:30]  Hello.  Hey, King.  Hello.  Hello there.  Hello.  How's it going?  King? King?  Yeah.  Is this the king?  Yeah.  Okay. You sound like the king. I hear that voice. Now we've got your seedy graveland.  Do you like it?  Um, yeah, it's great.  It's, uh, it's, uh, quite, um, different. Um, I guess the concept is you're the king, uh, singing other people's songs that are dead. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah. And we played Come As You Are in Sweet Home, Alabama on our show already.  Thank you.  Uh, getting rave reviews by our, by our listeners. And, um...  They like it, yeah?  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's great.  So why imitate the king?  Well, it's someone I have loved and admired since I was seven years old.  Do you know why we have you on the phone?  No. Why?  We're trying to, uh, decide if you're worthy or not to come down here and hang with us. 
[00:01:30]  And so far, you're, you're, you're not winning the battle.  All right.  I'm serious.  So what else could you give us?  We do, uh, several acoustic songs.  Yeah. So you're gonna...  And answer any questions that you want to have answered.  Well, there's not many questions we want to ask, uh, an Elvis impersonator.  Are you an Elvis impersonator? Do you dress up like Elvis and stuff?  Well, I wear a black leather costume. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Similar to the one that Elvis wore in a 60th TV special.  You sound very excited.  Well, I've been up for 4.30 this morning. I'm exhausted.  Yeah, I have.  We, we had so many, uh, planes delayed on us.  Mm-hmm.  In Chicago.  And, uh, it's been a real long day.  We're setting up a special studio for you, King.  Right.  Yeah. So I'm worthy then.  Well, I don't know if you're worthy yet. I think you need some stack or two.  Well, here's our plan.  This is a good idea. 
[00:02:30]  Here's our plan.  We want you to do a couple, uh, at least one song from your Gravelands CD.  Yeah.  But we want you to perform it in the bathroom here at N.E.W.  Can you do that?  In the bathroom?  In the bathroom, on the potty.  We're setting up a microphone and everything.  Yeah, we'll have a mic in there for you.  On the potty?  Yeah.  No.  Headphones and stuff.  So, well, you don't have to take your pants down or anything.  You've just got to sit on the toilet.  No.  And, uh, play your song.  No, I don't want to do that. 
[00:03:00]  Why not?  Because I think it's sick.  Why is that sick?  Because it...  I heard there's good acoustics in the bathroom.  Because Elvis Presley died in the bathroom.  Well, yeah, that's the reason we want to do it.  Yeah, that'll give it more of a...  The ultimate, uh, tribute to the, to the king himself.  What do you say?  No.  We'll negotiate this point.  We'll, uh, we'll plug...  They want me to sing from the bathroom.  We'll plug your CD.  We'll allow you to play a couple songs.  Elvis died in the bathroom.  It's like the king on his throne. 
[00:03:30]  And they're saying, uh, they wanted to talk to me on the phone first to see was I maybe worthy enough to sign into the studio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you think?  I'm worthy enough to go to the studio, no problem, but I don't want to sing from the bathroom.  Why not?  That'll be neat.  We have a mic in there and everything.  I'm not going to sit on the toilet and sing.  On the toilet and sing?  No.  See, now, it doesn't sound like you have much of a sense of humor about you.  Are you a funny guy? 
[00:04:00]  A fun guy?  Or are you very serious?  Uh.  You're a pretty serious dude.  I would say, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, having five children.  Dude, it's a...  And a mortgage is pretty serious.  It's a goof CD, so we're going to goof around with you.  What can I tell you?  It's a goof CD.  A goof.  Goof.  Not good.  Goof.  It's kind of goofy.  Goof.  Goofy?  Goofy.  Wouldn't you think?  Yeah.  Like, it's kind of...  Don't you think it's a little weird?  Like, I would think you would have this tremendous sense of humor. 
[00:04:30]  It's a fun, warm-hearted CD.  Um, it was okay.  I mean, I thought the music was good.  I thought the impersonation needed a little work, but...  Well, that's your opinion, your intent to it.  So what do you say, King?  No.  We got the studio set up?  No.  It's a great...  It's a great room, acoustically?  Ah, no.  I don't want to sing from the bathroom, sitting on a toilet.  Is that just because you would never sing from a bathroom? 
[00:05:00]  It's out of respect for Elvis Presley.  Out of respect for Elvis?  I think Elvis would be into something like this.  No.  Come on, we wanted you to, you know, be naked in there.  We'll take that away, so you just have to sit on the toilet.  No, I don't want to sit on the toilet.  Why not?  I just explained why.  What if the lid was down?  Yeah, the lid will be down.  I don't care if the lid's down or up.  You don't have to, like...  The cubicle door's open or closed or whatever.  You don't have to take a dump when you hit the high notes or something, you know?  We're just looking for you to sit on the ball. 
[00:05:30]  We'll have a mic in there, headphones.  So that's how Elvis Presley died, is it?  I guess, that's what they say.  That's what they say, but I don't think it was during his performance of a song.  Come on, you're an Elvis impersonator.  Yeah.  You do other people's dead songs.  Yeah?  So you should have a sense of humor and do this.  And then we'll plug the CD and everything.  Yeah, but it's not the derogatory humor.  It's a...  Hey, King, you're making money off other dead artists' work. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  I'm making money.  I haven't made any money.  You know, you sing...  I haven't made any money.  How do you know what money I've made?  You sing a Nirvana song, a Leonard Skinner song, an ACDC song, a Jimi Hendrix.  Excuse me.  You are making money off other dead people's work by playing the records on your radio station.  Yeah, and we'll spin records from the bathroom, too.  James Cameron made the film Titanic.  So you want to start accusing him of making money off people dead.  Oh, we hit a soft spot, I believe.  We're not accusing you of anything. 
[00:06:30]  All we're saying is...  We're just saying if you're going to sing other people's songs that are dead, that you should  have a sense of humor to perform them on the toilet.  As Elvis.  No.  As Elvis.  No.  Elvis died on the toilet.  Get it?  No.  Are you, like, in love with Elvis?  I've explained that I don't want to get on the toilet and sing out of respect for the  memory of Elvis.  Are you in love with Elvis?  Is that it?  Like, you have this love for him?  Yeah, fraternal love.  Anything wrong with that?  A fraternal love?  Anything wrong with the fraternal love?  What is...  Or have you found a way to make money off his name? 
[00:07:00]  What?  Just asking.  Elvis seemed to have had a sense of humor.  Yeah, he had a wonderful sense of humor.  Great sense of humor.  Yeah, and that's kind of a weird sense of humor thing to perform.  One of the songs sitting on the toilet.  No.  No?  So what do you say, King?  I've already told you about 20 times.  I thought we could talk you into it.  What?  I thought we could talk you into it.  No.  See, I guess you didn't really know much about our show then, huh?  No.  We have every artist that ever comes into Opie and Anthony's studio performs from the bathroom. 
[00:07:30]  That's right.  No.  And it's just a coincidence that Elvis died on the toilet.  We didn't even take that into consideration.  No.  It is kind of the way it's set up.  Well, all right.  So your final answer is no?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  I guess we could play your CD from here then.  Well, it's up to you.  Would you like to hear me play it?  Well, I would like to go into the studio where you are and perform the songs. 
[00:08:00]  Well, no, no.  The deal is...  We can't do that.  The deal is you perform from the bathroom or that's...  No.  All right.  Well, then I'll play your CD here in the studio.  Why can't you let me go into the studio and perform the songs last?  Because we want...  It's much more fun if you do it in the bathroom.  Yeah.  No.  No?  You sound intense, man.  What?  You sound like you're going to cry or something.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm not fine.  You sound intense.  All right. 
[00:08:30]  Do you ever lighten up or loosen up or laugh or something?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  Not now.  Don't have a sense of humor, huh?  It doesn't sound like...  All right.  Well, would you like to listen as I play your CD here in the studio?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, King.  There's pieces of CD all over the studio.  Well, do you think you're the one that has to clean it up?  Yeah, that's all right, though.  It was worth it.  All right, man.  Have a great weekend.  I will.  All right.  See you. 
[00:09:30]  Bye-bye.  Oh, my God.  I don't think that step was necessary, Opie.  What?  I understand he wasn't going to sing from the bathroom, but Rick's got to go deal with this.  Why is everyone leaving me?  I don't know.  I think you were a little harsh. 
[00:10:00]  No, he was being rude to us, too, man.  All right.  We got to take a break.  I thought he was going to sing from the bathroom.  I swear to God, I thought we were going to get him to sing from the bathroom.  Well, that would have been fun, right?  Yeah.  What was the big deal?  He seemed to not want to do it because of Elvis.  Elvis died on the toilet.  All right.  So, out of his love for Elvis.  What happened?  I thought we were just having fun.  When Paul is all up, you treat them like, you know, good people. 
[00:10:30]  You don't talk down to them.  Hey, fuck you.  Jesus Christ, shut up.  You idiot.  You're such a loser.  Hey, fuck you.  What a retard.  You're high.  What, are you, stupid?  Hey, fuck you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Speaking of baseball, did you see the article in the Daily News today?  You've got to get this point of view across, I guess.  Baseball diamonds are a gal's best friend. 
[00:11:00]  Wow.  The hunk-o-meter.  Yeah, they're pitting Jeter against Piazza.  Obviously, for a hunk.  Who's the biggest hunk?  Who's the biggest hunk?  Yeah.  Jeter or Piazza.  She's got a bunch of stats and everything.  This is Cheryl Connelly from the Daily News.  You know, this lady smokes crack.  She has to.  She's writing a whole article on this, right, Ant?  Yeah.  And where he'd take you for a weekend getaway.  Dirk Jeter.  This lady assumes that Dirk Jeter would take you to meet his mom. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  I don't care that he plays for the Yankees.  Is that what he calls his penis, mom?  Exactly.  I'll take you to meet my mom.  She's delusional.  He's a guy, for Christ's sake.  Where'd she live, the Comac Motorist?  Her brother.  Odds on getting to third base with Dirk Jeter.  Only if you're a pop diva who can hit the high notes.  Oh, ho, ho.  I think she's trying to be wacky.  Wow, that was worth being on page nine of the Daily News today. 
[00:12:00]  Is this sports?  Odds on getting to third base with Piazza.  Only if you could dress flashier than he does.  Does any sports fan really care about this?  I guess she's catering to the ladies or something.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Imagine a mad dog on a van.  Today we're taking phone calls.  Hey, you know, who's the biggest hunk?  Come on, look at the Jeter at Piazza.  You've got to give Jeter a lot of credit.  I mean, he's got a nice ass.  Look at him.  Hey, mad dog, are you trying to tell me you're bored with taking phone calls about the Mets and the Yankees? 
[00:12:30]  Well, this is in the paper today.  I think it's sports over the end of the day.  Over the end of the day.  What would you like to talk about?  You know, concerned sports.  Would you like to talk to some of your listeners today?  Yeah, why not?  I think we can take a few phone calls.  All right, why don't you throw the topic out there?  Well, who's the biggest hunk?  Jeter at Piazza.  Yeah, I've seen them both.  I've been looking at them.  Jeter, I've got to give Jeter a yes.  But Piazza's got the arms, and I think Piazza's a little hairier. 
[00:13:00]  I prefer my men with a hairy chest.  And not enough I like Piazza, he's squatting all the time, being a catcher.  Yeah.  Hey, you don't want the testicles dragging in the dirt like that.  It can make calluses, and I don't think I want to handle callus-y testicles.  You know what I mean?  That's right, Dwork.  And, gee, you know, he's been with some hose bags in his day, but I think I could turn him around.  I'd take him in the backseat of my toy rotor.  Toy rotor.  So who would you give the rusty trombone to? 
[00:13:30]  Well, you've got to go with Piazza on the rusty trombone.  Because I'm not reaching for the testicles.  I'm giving him a reach-around.  But you've got to figure out what a catcher is squatting and a lot of air blowing through back there.  It's not going to stink.  It's maybe a Jeter who's standing up a lot.  All right, let's go to the phones, all right?  It's a great topic for your show today on WFAG.  All right, Joe, you're on the air.  I'm not going to mad dog on the bed.  Hi, I'd just like to say that Meister Piazza has the best ass.  What are you talking about?  You've got to give Jeter the ass. 
[00:14:00]  No, no.  I'm an ass man.  I know.  Jeter's got the better ass.  Oh, come on.  Come on, my friend.  Ain't that bunch of steel?  You don't see him there when he's behind the plate.  Crouched down or bent over like that.  It gets me so excited.  Oh, oh.  Thank you, Joe.  We never had a big cause like this on a van.  As far as hairdos go, I don't know, I kind of like the coiff of Piazza's button.  Better than that short thing of Jeter's button.  You don't like that wacky beard of Piazza's or the wacky sideburn? 
[00:14:30]  No, I like a little bit of hair on my thighs.  You know, I don't like the short hair that Jeter's got.  No.  But I give him the ass.  Okay.  And I'm okay.  That's right, dog.  I've undressed both of these with my eyes.  And, you know, I've got to give, like I said, the ass to Jeter's chest and arms to Piazza.  Nice, strong, manly arms.  No surprise you like the Giants.  Oh, he could probably. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Piazza, I know, if I'm in a sack with him, he could throw me around like a little spinner.  You know, a strong upper body strength.  But I think Piazza would be a lot more sensitive to my new feminine needs.  That's right, dog.  Joe, you're on the air with Mad Dog.  Is this Mad Dog?  Yeah, I'm not going to Mad Dog, Joe.  Out of bed.  How you doing?  What do you think, Joe?  I think that Jeter's better.  Hey. 
[00:15:30]  Can't curse on the radio show.  Oh, brother.  This is just getting bad.  That was pretty funny, too, Tava.  That didn't make the air.  All right, let's take another break here, all right?  All right.  Are you done, Mad Dog?  No, baby.  Why don't you bring Imus in with you today?  Oh, jeez.  You want to go there?  No.  I've got my big fag cowboy hat on my lap here as I'm looking at Piazza. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And it's growing.  Yeah, that guy gets the wrinkle out of my neck.  You know, we've got to talk to Rick really fast here.  Yeah.  On the instant feedback, Randy from Tarrytown, New York.  He writes, I just saw that punishment video with Ricky. 
[00:16:30]  Holy jeez, what a chokehold he had on that prude.  Oh, yeah.  I saw the clip, Rick.  I haven't even seen it.  All right, go over there and check it out on Anthony's computer.  Clip up on the...  I'll explain it while Ant gets the clip.  We don't even want to talk about her anymore, but we have to this one last time.  Christian, the Oklahoma prude, came down.  She promised that she would bring beer and get topless for us and hang out in the studio.  We said, cool, we like seeing naked breasts.  Come on down.  She comes down and she turns out to be the biggest prude ever to appear on the O.P. 
[00:17:00]  Anthony show.  Yeah.  So we come up with this punishment.  We make her see the 100-year-old lady having sex, a video that Steve from the unofficial website  brought in yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  And Rick is making her watch this video.  Yeah.  And he's really being forceful, which is kind of a good thing.  But, Rick, look at the hold you have on her.  Do I want to see this?  I don't know.  Just look at her go.  That is so...  Yeah, watch this. 
[00:17:30]  Now watch this.  Here she goes.  She's going nuts now.  Come on, look up.  Look, look, there you go.  He's like, look up.  You want to take your top off now?  You want to take your top off now, don't you?  You must have your fingerprints around her neck, Rick.  What's wrong with you?  Go into the other studio and get the real audio so everyone at home can hear it.  We got the audio of Rick and the prude watching the 100-year-old lady having sex, and Rick  is just forcing this poor girl, now I feel sorry for her, forcing her to watch this video. 
[00:18:00]  I don't feel sorry for her at all, but, boy, that Rick, huh?  He's got a couple issues, maybe.  All right, Rick, go ahead.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And what's that?  That is the man in his penis.  So disgusting.  Come on, watch.  Sit straight and watch.  Oh, God.  Watch it.  Don't you turn your eyes.  Don't you look away.  Look at that.  Oh, that's so disgusting.  Look at it. 
[00:18:30]  Look at it.  Look.  Yeah.  You like Grandma, right?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Is that what you look like with your clothes off?  Huh?  Watch.  What's wrong with you, Rick?  Oh.  Don't you turn away.  Look.  Look at her.  Look at her.  At this point, you're grabbing her around the neck.  Look at her go, yeah.  Look at her go.  Yeah, this is your punishment.  No, I can't.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  This is your punishment. 
[00:19:00]  You wanted it.  Oh, my God.  You want to take your top off now?  You want to take your top off now, don't you?  Jesus, Rick.  What's wrong with you?  Come on, look.  Keep the hands down.  Oh, look.  She's getting it hard.  Look at her go.  Look.  Look.  Isn't that great?  Look at that.  Like a freaking...  Oh, look at her go.  Oh, oh.  Here, look at this.  Watch this.  Watch this shot.  Yeah, look at this.  Watch that.  See that?  It's like an assault going on. 
[00:19:30]  Look at her go.  You like it, right?  Don't you?  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  That's good, right?  No.  Is that the way you like it?  Yeah, look up.  Look up, look up.  Oh, you're missing it.  Look at them go.  Look.  Check it out.  No.  You want to take your top off now?  Come on.  Yeah, you do.  Look at them.  Look at them.  That could be you and Grandpa.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  This could be you in 60 years.  And then the whole time he's got her in a chokehold. 
[00:20:00]  Look up.  Look up.  Look up.  Dude, you're spiting me.  Look up.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Oh, my God.  That is so disgusting.  She's going to have dreams about that tonight.  That.  Yeah.  That is so disgusting.  That is so disgusting.  Watch.  Watch this shot.  I mean, the fact that I've never really seen a porno before.  Look up.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Look up.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, my God.  A little pumpkin pie right there.  Look at it.  Look.  Look.  You will look.  You want to take your top off now?  I'll stop the tape.  Take your top off now.  I'll stop the tape.  Take the top off now and you won't be scarred for life.  I promise.  No.  No.  I promise.  No.  Look.  Look up.  Look at her.  Yeah, Grandma's getting some more.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Uh-huh. 
[00:21:00]  That is so horrifying.  Well, Rick, man.  Rick, what the hell's wrong with you, man?  I don't know.  That's pretty disturbing to listen to.  That video is up on Steve's unofficial site and you can see Rick.  I mean, you had her in a chokehold.  Dude, she was fighting me.  Fighting?  Yeah.  It's not one of the guys.  I didn't have any rope to tie her down with, so I had to hold her in place.  Now you're bullying around, like, prudes from Oklahoma.  Rick checking in on the instant feedback of Rich.  Rick beats his wife. 
[00:21:30]  That's all he writes.  John, what's going on?  Big F you out to Rick, man.  What?  What did I do?  Rick, you're a bully, guy.  You got to stop beating up women.  And then you got to...  You're beating on opie.  Now you're beating on women, guy.  You got to slow down, man.  Well, beating on opie and beating on women, same thing.  Rick is like that psycho guy from the movie 8 Millimeter.  Is he into snuff flicks, too?  Yeah.  I'm telling you, Rick.  And then you were, like, trying to pry her eyelids open.  She was not looking at the film.  Frank, what's going on?  I think Rick the homo's spick might have been a dominatrix in his past life. 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  Bob from Queens checking in.  It sounds like Tubby Tom and his wife at Christmas.  Oh, fuck.  Watch the film.  Come on.  Anthony.  Yeah, I got to ask a question.  Yeah, hit it.  Could Rick hear you from the other studio?  You guys were yelling at him.  Oh, yeah.  No, I couldn't.  Oh, you couldn't hear him?  Couldn't hear you at all.  Oh, because we were trying to make you stop yesterday.  No, you guys were yelling at him to make her look.  Yeah, you were.  But if he couldn't hear that, he's a sick bastard. 
[00:22:30]  Joe, what's up?  Hey, Rick, what happened?  The guy who gave you gay crabs used to do this to you, so now you're beating on chicks?  Yeah, that's what it was, dude.  Oh, man.  All Rick needs is a wife-beater t-shirt with a few mustard stains on it, and he's set.  Paul, what's going on?  Yo, man.  That's cool, man.  Rick's not a bully.  That's excellent, man.  Too bad he didn't have any rope, man.  He should have tied her to that chair.  Keep her in that headlock.  Me and go watch that film.  Rick, you're the man. 
[00:23:00]  Awesome to these people.  Thanks, dude.  Paul, I don't think you understand how bad this film is.  You can't comprehend how bad it is to see a 100-year-old lady having sex.  Is she really that old?  Dude, she's a fossil.  All right, let's say they lied and she's really 88.  I mean, come on.  Yeah, it's really bad.  Well, yeah.  It is as bad as it gets.  Is she a hot 88 or is she a hot 88?  What's the story?  How do you determine a hot 88?  That's what I need to know.  Well, I'm going to check it out when I get home on the unofficial website. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  We're power to you, Rick.  All right.  Aaron from Long Island, where did Rick learn his negotiating skills?  Oh, Jay.  There's some guys that think that Rick did a good job, though.  Tony, what's up?  First of all, Rick's totally right.  This girl is a whore.  Yeah.  She didn't take off her clothes like she was supposed to.  She let us down two days in a row.  I say you slap her with a two-by-four.  She says everything she got.  Rick might be into it, but she was a lot more into it.  She was loving it.  Everybody was right today. 
[00:24:00]  This girl is a slut and a whore and is into the dominatrix.  Rick, get her with the knife, baby!  All right, Tony.  Jesus Christ.  Pete, what's up?  Yeah, Opie, you're real quick to bash Rick for making the girl watch the video.  Don't you like the old chicks?  I mean, you kiss your grandmother with an open mouth.  All right, listen.  I think I got over that fetish yesterday.  If there was any doubt, I think I got over it yesterday, okay?  Okay.  Because if you see the video we saw yesterday, trust me, it's done. 
[00:24:30]  Your grandma's making videos now?  You ass.  That's pretty good.  All right.  Mike.  Hey, Rick, what's your favorite announcer?  Marv Albert.  Yes.  Watch that film.  Yes.  Is your favorite hockey player, Tennis Ponson?  Beat your wife Ponson?  Beat your wife.  Natalie thinks it's our fault, Anthony.  Natalie.  You guys are bashing Rick.  Right.  And you guys were the ones telling him to make her watch. 
[00:25:00]  You got him all riled up.  I didn't hear that in the audio portion of that.  Oh, I heard it.  I was listening.  We did tell Rick to make her look, but we didn't say, hey, Rick, strangle her.  Because Rick is, like, forcing her and we're cheering him on.  There was just a bad scene in here again yesterday.  I got audio of just you guys cheering.  Just you guys cheering.  Saying, yeah, she's not looking.  Pull her hands away from her eyes.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we were wrong, too.  Uh-uh.  You want to hear a little bit of it?  Uh-uh. 
[00:25:30]  I don't even want to hear it.  Accessories to the fact.  Is that it?  I don't want to hear this.  Here it is.  All right.  All right, listen.  All right, listen.  This is the punishment.  Pull her hands away from her eyes.  Make her look at it.  Yeah, pull her hands away.  Make her look.  She's covering her eyes.  That would be Anthony.  Shut up.  Come on.  Rick, make sure she looks.  Pull her hands away from her eyes.  She's covering her eyes.  Rick, pull her hands away from her eyes. 
[00:26:00]  Make her look at it.  I'm serious.  That's OP, too.  Guilty.  She's watching the 100-year-old woman get bagged.  This is her punishment.  She has to look at a lady that's 100 having sex on a videotape.  Make her look.  I'm serious.  Make her watch.  Make her watch.  This is bad.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Guilty.  You can learn a lesson from this 100-year-old lady.  Make her watch. 
[00:26:30]  Make her watch.  Pull her head up.  Look up.  See?  You see?  Oh, no.  You're being a puss in there.  Make her look.  See?  She's covering her face.  She's covering her face.  Wait a minute.  I didn't say that.  I did not say that.  It's in a ring.  I saw my voice.  Rick sounds like a porn star.  You like that.  Trust me.  This is a real punishment.  Because if you saw this video, pull her hands away from her eyes. 
[00:27:00]  She's pretty.  Oh, she's horrified.  She's horrified.  I think.  Look up.  Look at it.  Make her look, Rick.  Make her look.  Look at it.  Make her watch.  Get her back.  Get her back in here.  She's never seen porn before.  Look up.  Look up at that shot.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  All right.  All right.  She is lost.  She's got her eyes shut now.  She's got her eyes shut completely, Rick. 
[00:27:30]  Pry them open with a hammer.  You can tell the prude is disturbed.  She is very disturbed.  She's wiping her eyes.  Make her look up, Rick.  Oh, that's it.  One last shot, Rick.  For God's sake.  Rick's watching.  Look at that.  Accessories to the fact.  Yes.  That's bad.  All right.  I think she's learned a lesson, Rick.  Now, don't bring her back in here. 
[00:28:00]  No?  No.  Keep her out in the lobby.  Maybe she'd want to...  Keep her in the lobby with the mops.  That's the line.  All right.  I don't know.  It seemed like Opie was a little more rambunctious than I was.  It's...  I got to save myself here.  We're back live again.  That was audio from yesterday.  I'm going to take the fifth.  Too late.  Until I talk to my lawyer.  I don't think that was my voice from yesterday.  I think you doctor it somehow. 
[00:28:30]  Dan, what's the instant feedback saying now?  I'm not even going with that.  I think it's down.  Yeah.  I can't seem to get any instant feedback here.  Anthony again.  All you effing guys need wife-beater T-shirts.  All right.  Mobile and Anthony.  You dribbling pukes!  1027-WNEW.  All-Time Association, let me help you.  Hello?  I have this number in my wallet.  I don't know where I am. 
[00:29:00]  You don't know where you are?  I have this number in my wallet.  Your Lord?  I don't know.  I'm at a phone booth.  Give me the phone number.  It's not on here.  There's no phone number on the phone?  Let me look.  What phone?  You're calling from a phone.  Is there a phone number there?  Yes, there is.  Could I have the phone number?  I believe it's the age.  Hold on the phone.  Can you hold on?  Don't hang up.  Hello?  Yes, can you hear me?  Who's this?  This is a cell.  Can you hear me? 
[00:29:30]  Hello?  Don't hang the phone up.  Hang up?  No.  Do not hang up.  Hold on, please.  Don't hang up.  I'm going to put you on the phone with someone else.  Hold on.  Hang up what?  No.  It's cold.  You're cold?  I'm colder, yes.  I know.  It's cold like Brazil.  This is a weird thing.  Do you know?  I believe I need a change.  Stay on the phone.  I'm wet.  You're all wet?  Yeah, I'm wet.  Okay.  Well, you just stay on the phone.  I need a change in and my nurse isn't here.  And do you know the phone number you are? 
[00:30:00]  Can you tell me the number?  I'm going to walk across the street now.  No, stay on the phone.  Who's this now?  My name is Judy.  What's yours?  I call my name's Bill.  Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  Hi, Sam.  You sound a little lost.  I'm going to walk across the street now.  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't  talk to you.  Whoa!  Hey!  Hey, Bill.  Hey!  Hello!  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please? 
[00:30:30]  This is Judy.  Is this Bill?  Where's Sam?  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Oh.  Sam knows I hate coffee.  Well, maybe he went to get you a coffee and he said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now.  A lot of cars.  I'm going to cross the street now.  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street.  All right.  Here I go.  I know.  I can't talk to you.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go. 
[00:31:00]  Are you talking on the phone, Bill?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, we should have called the police while we had him.  What did he do when he said?  He's still here.  He did.  He probably was pissed off.  He did not hang up.  He put the phone down the wall.  He blocked the phone.  He did not hang up.  Oh, my God!  Somebody call an ambulance!  I told you.  Now, this is horrible.  My God, he looks awful.  Jesus.  Who is this?  Who am I speaking to, please? 
[00:31:30]  Somebody call an ambulance!  Help over here!  Somebody have got his!  This is horrible.  We're calling an ambulance.  Can you give me the address?  He's a mess!  They've got hit!  Someone call an ambulance!  Don't touch him!  Leave him down there!  Hello?  Can you give me...  Tell me where you are?  It's too late!  It's too late!  This...  This...  Man...  Spirit all over the road!  Can you tell me where you are?  It's too late!  I thought you got a shovel!  I will get a shovel. 
[00:32:00]  Where are you?  It's too late!  It isn't too late!  It's too late!  What do you mean it's too late?  It's too late!  It's the late!  It's over there!  And it's also...  Oh!  I can't help you if you won't tell us where you are.  You can't help anymore!  Just bring a shovel!  Can you tell me where you are right now?  Disneyland!  In Disneyland!  Can you tell me where in Disneyland? 
[00:32:30]  Pirates of the Caribbean!  And the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.  I'm okay now.  You're okay? You got all pulled yourself together again?  A car hit me and I feel fine now.  Oh, I'm so glad you feel fine, Bill.  You had me really worried.  That's all Bill needed was a little bumper.  Can you tell me where you are, Bill?  Jupiter.  On Jupiter.  Planet Jupiter.  Is there a street number or a name on planet Jupiter? 
[00:33:00]  Twenty-three Jupiter.  Twenty-three Jupiter.  Twenty-three.  Okay, do you live there?  Send a cab.  I would happily send a cab if you tell me where to send it.  To tell them to make a right at Venus.  Right at Venus.  And it's Jupiter, twenty-eight Jupiter.  Twenty-eight?  That's what I said.  Okay.  And what are you doing there now?  Masturbating.  Oh, I see. 
[00:33:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  One, oh, two, seven.  W-N-E-W.  And it's Opie and Anthony and Adam Farrar sitting in on the show today.  Having lots and lots of fun.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we get some brewskis in here?  Sure.  We just moved into a new office.  We had to get a second fridge.  Yeah.  There was a refrigerator in the office that we're moving into, but we're taking the one  that was in our old office, and that's going to be the beer fridge. 
[00:34:00]  Just the beer.  Sounds sensible.  Well, it's a full-size Westinghouse refrigerator.  Just the beer fridge.  And then there's some little cubby hole with some ice in it for food.  There's some cold-cut drawing, throwing out.  We have our priorities.  You know, you can't get beer bowls anymore.  Remember the beer bowls you used to get?  I think I had them last weekend after a full night of drinking.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Well, maybe.  You know the beer bowls?  Not your own personal ones, but the one for public consumption. 
[00:34:30]  Right, the beer bowl.  How old are you?  What'd you have in mind?  And you're still buying beer bowls?  You want me to buy your beer?  What, are you going to hang out in the woods?  You're a pisser.  You get them for lunch.  Not a beer bowl.  It's a keg.  I'm not messing around.  I remember the parties where someone,  Hey, I got a beer bowl.  Cool.  Come on, we'll go over to Bison's house.  He's got a beer bowl.  A beer bowl.  We used to get them at the apartment.  You were always terrible.  I'll tell you one thing.  Yeah, these guys used to live together.  I'm strictly like a bud guy. 
[00:35:00]  I like a nice ice-cold bud coming out of the fridge.  I hated when people would come over,  Adam,  with a six-pack of warm Meister Brow.  We have LeBats.  Meister Brow.  The master brew.  And put it in the fridge.  And then pop a bud.  I know those guys.  I was, well, okay.  How much money did I make, Mr. Radio Man?  Oh, yeah.  I was raking in a fortune setting up above-ground pools. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, no, I was bringing in more money digging holes for fences.  You were?  No, I wasn't.  You were making more money than I was, pal.  I wasn't.  And then you went to that lucrative selling binoculars job.  That was a good one.  What are you doing, Adam?  I'm selling binoculars.  And then the all-time favorite of mine,  when he comes over my house with a water filtration system,  now he's in the water filtration business.  Him and Jimbo.  You can be a millionaire.  And I have found the future. 
[00:36:00]  He turned into Ralph Cramden.  I swear to God.  You're right.  Norton, get down here.  All of a sudden, I'm Norton.  He's trying to sell me on this idea.  Water filtration, Norton.  Look, it's the wave of the future, pal.  Mr. Monaghan will back us.  All you need to be a millionaire is turn to rent.  Turn to rent.  He's telling me about this blue cylinder  that goes either under your sink or right there next to the faucet  in a decorative canister.  And it hooks up to your system and filters your water. 
[00:36:30]  You know how many impurities are in your water, pal?  Look at it.  There's sea monkeys floating in there.  And then I'm telling him, well, what does this entail?  What do you have to do to get into this business,  to hook these things up?  Are you installing them yourself?  Do you hire a crew?  He goes, all you got to do is this.  And he makes the hand motion of turning a wrench.  That was it.  That's all he ever told me.  That's your key to the future.  Key to the future.  The turn of a wrench.  A quarter turn of a wrench. 
[00:37:00]  I go, well, what does it take?  What's the initial investment?  What do you have to do?  Where do you keep the equipment?  Turn of the wrench.  Turn of the wrench.  He turned into Ralph friggin' Crandon.  You're right.  Tableau on pizza.  Wave of the future.  Glowing a dark wallpaper.  Chef of the future.  We'll get a commercial, pal.  Maybe we should say something about spearfishing.  But that was the best one after that.  And then he chose comedy.  I think you chose comedy as you were doing the water filtration. 
[00:37:30]  I was a dishwasher.  Last straight was I was a dishwasher.  Oh, was that it?  Yeah.  Look at all the occupations, Adam.  You were the air conditioning guy?  Yeah, I did that.  Thank God I got out of that.  But no, I think you always made more money than I did.  No.  You could afford the Budweiser and not the Meisterbrow.  How do you figure?  And what's the difference?  It's not like Bud, you're buying Dom Perignon or anything like that.  But it always was a little more than the Meisterbrow.  But I hated that.  Guys that would bring warm Meisterbrow, put it in the fridge and pop my cold Buds. 
[00:38:00]  Take your Bud.  I had to have money for the bread pudding.  What that damn bread pudding?  Used to live over at Greenlawn, an area of Greenlawn that was really, really turning ethnic very quickly.  And a palatial place you had.  We used to call it the Anne Frank Suite.  Yeah, I know.  Very nice.  You had to move the bookcase.  We'd go to the deli around the corner and you'd have to put on your flag jacket.  I swear to God, it was bad.  Near Sam's Pizza? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Over there.  It was bellow.  Where one road divides, I swear, it's like all of a sudden you're in Botswana.  It was, I swear to God.  And they're angry they lost the soccer finals.  It was really bad.  Yeah, it was bad.  And the place was like the honeycomb hideout.  It was like this little shack and this lean-to.  But he had his Budweiser.  Don't touch his bud.  Sitting on the couch.  Like the king.  Get out of the way.  It's my spot.  My beer.  He's like Daffy Duff. 
[00:39:00]  Mine, mine, mine.  Down, down, down.  Go, go, go.  When I first moved in, you could go to the deli.  When you first moved in.  He was a squatter.  When he first moved in.  Like there was a ceremony in a truck.  I paid the first month's rent.  Yeah.  The landlord died.  And people drive by and go, nobody can live there.  We used to duck.  You were in the house a few times when we saw the landlord's car pull up.  Yeah.  Shut the lights in the TV.  Duck behind the windows.  He peeks in.  Yeah.  And we'd have to hide.  And you want to know what's funny?  He would look in his living room and go, nobody lives there. 
[00:39:30]  No one could possibly live in that squalor.  But when we first moved in there, the neighborhood was still okay.  And you could go to the deli and get things.  You know, I would like a ham and Swiss on a hero with mustard, please.  Okay.  Right away, sir.  Would you like coleslaw with that?  Yes.  Before it turned into the bodega?  All of a sudden, oh.  I'm walking in.  I'm looking at foods.  It's like, what?  What is this?  Zebra?  It's a zebra meat.  Bean pie, my brother?  Yeah.  I didn't know. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, look.  Opie's hair of the belt.  Opie's going to bell me.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to watch out for those delis with the zebra meat.  There's black people.  No, but the neighborhood turned really quick after that.  And the whole line of stores now is boarded up.  And the funniest part about the neighborhood, the police station was three blocks down in the corner.  They never went down that street.  No.  Hell no.  The cops wouldn't go down there.  I got a family.  I'm not going down there.  They were better on.  Yeah, no.  Why would you want to drive down there?  Oh, man. 
[00:40:30]  That was, we had a lot of fun at that place.  That is very funny.  Remind me about it, because I don't remember any of it.  Yes, you do.  It all is a blur.  I remember we used to hide stuff, because there was holes in the walls.  So, like, you could put stuff in the walls and everything.  Here comes the landlord.  Ditch the computer.  Put it in the wall.  How about the time I dropped the camcorder down a hole in the bathroom wall into the ceiling of the downstairs apartment?  Because they used to fight all the time down there and recorded everything that happened. 
[00:41:00]  Are you like Chuck Berry?  It's on the TV.  Yeah.  We got it hooked up to the TV.  It's like, ah, look at him fight.  Come on.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, he was like a mad scientist.  Kind of like that scene in Revenge of the Nerds.  Yeah.  That was it.  That was you.  And he was up there drinking his butt going, look at that.  She ain't going to take any more of this.  Watch.  She's going to hit him.  See?  What did I tell you?  We drop it through.  They had a hung ceiling downstairs.  So, at first, I had to drop through a string with a barbed hook at the end to lift the ceiling tile up a little bit. 
[00:41:30]  And then we laid the camcorder down and just watched them yell at each other.  It was funny.  While he was setting this stuff up, we'd be, like, humming the Mission Impossible music.  Or I was going to call him Anthony MacGyver.  Oh, yeah.  All kinds of stuff.  Muff Diver.  Muff Diver.  I remember the night I spent in jail.  And I came.  I had to come back after that.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yeah.  Now, Adam, why did you have to go to jail?  We played a gig, actually, at the...  What was that little bar by the OTB?  That was another Get Rich Squishy. 
[00:42:00]  I got a tip.  Some water purifiers.  Eighth race at Aqueduct.  Our ship is coming in.  Dumblegs in the eight.  What's the horse you bet on that died?  Yeah, died in the backstretch.  But I mean, really died.  And he brought out a bulldozer.  And then dead.  Dropped dead.  Animal House had a heart attack.  Adam just looks at me and goes, I'm never betting with you again.  Slep rock.  I had it to die.  I made a fortune.  I bet it to die.  Win, lose, or die. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, we did a gig, and we were coming home, and you got arrested with some chick.  No, the girl got arrested.  Right, the girl got arrested.  Yeah.  She got arrested for drunk driving, and I was in the car.  So the cop pulls her and goes, look, she's drunk.  You got to drive the car home.  I said, look, you know, I had some drinks, too.  I'm not getting in this car.  You're locking me up, too.  He goes, no, come on.  Just follow me to the station.  I said, oh, okay.  She was the girl with the big D's, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she was a...  Weren't you dating my sister at the time?  No, I wasn't. 
[00:43:00]  No, this was PD.  Oh, okay.  Post-dawn.  All right.  So we go in there, and she's arrested, and the guy comes out, and the cop comes out and  goes, look, she's got to sleep it off here.  And I said, to be honest with you, I had some drink.  I don't feel comfortable.  I better sleep it off with her.  Yeah.  He's still trying to score.  I figured out, can we get a private cell?  So she's sleeping it off, and I'm there.  It's the middle of the night.  What am I going to do?  Call my parents?  Hi, I'm not arrested, but I'm in jail.  You know what my father would say?  Stay there.  Stay there, right.  So I'm playing cards with the cops there at night. 
[00:43:30]  We're just sitting there.  I knock with a four, Garrity.  I want a couple of dollars playing poker with the cops.  And the cops start, like, you know, just nailing me when he goes, you're missing out on some  prime rodeo time.  She's going to sober up and not want any potty.  Hello?  Yeah, I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way. 
[00:44:00]  1027 WNEW.  And, by the way, if you haven't tuned in the news, Khalid Muhammad got his cute little  permit for his little million youth march.  As the mayor likes to call it, the 6,000 youth march.  6,000?  It's not a million people.  They didn't show up.  It's about 6,000 people.  He's being kind.  I think there were a couple hundred last year.  Yeah.  Yep.  So, when does it start?  11 o'clock, Saturday morning, on Malcolm X Boulevard, up in Harlem, if you feel so inclined  to show up. 
[00:44:30]  Malcolm X Boulevard.  Stay away, Whitey.  Stay away, Whitey.  Cracker alert.  Cracker alert.  No cracker zone.  It is a cracker-free afternoon on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem this Saturday.  When was the last time you were up there?  Who are you kidding?  Who, me?  Been a cracker-free zone for many years.  I was just up there, um, let's see, when was I up in Harlem?  Yeah, Rick makes a good point.  Yeah, Friday.  Friday, on my way up to Massachusetts.  You were up?  Because I had to cut through Harlem. 
[00:45:00]  Oh.  How many red lights did you go through?  I don't pay attention to traffic signals up there.  Oh, no.  I don't pay attention to roads.  Yeah.  I will drive on the sidewalk.  Well, you can't.  I mean, I'm going up on the sidewalk at one point.  There's some woman who's like, whoa, my baby, look out for my stroller.  Crazy-ass, hog-ass cracker.  And it's like, whoa, look out.  You can't even tell where the roads are in that.  Oh, my God.  I had, like, the whole front of my grill was Colt 45 labels from when I was just going through garbage pails and stuff. 
[00:45:30]  Why?  Why?  Rick makes a good point about the Million Youth March.  It's going to start at 11 a.m., and it's going to be done at 11.01.  Wow.  As soon as Khalid Muhammad opens his damn mouth.  Yeah.  And we must kill the white.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  All right, everybody disperse.  What did he say last year?  He said, grab the cops' guns and use them against them.  How is this guy getting another permit? 
[00:46:00]  Right.  If somebody can say that, and then you wonder why cops shoot, this guy was telling people if the cops come in to break up the controlled riot, I guess, I don't know what the hell, to grab their guns and use them against the cops.  Yeah.  What the?  How do you say that, and then the next year you're granted another permit?  Freedom of speech, Anthony.  Unbelievable.  Hallelujah.  Freedom of speech.  And Khalid's like, yeah, my brothers, yeah, rise up, rise up, grab the gun. 
[00:46:30]  Ooh, the cops are here.  Let me run out the back where I won't be seen for months.  The guy disappeared.  Oh, man.  Reverend Al staying away, too?  Yeah.  He makes all the black leaders of the 60s and 70s really proud.  Doesn't he?  Oh, my God.  Khalid Muhammad.  Khalid Muhammad.  I don't know.  He won't.  Guess where I won't be Saturday.  Come on.  Um, Malcolm X Boulevard. 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  Malcolm X Boulevard.  All right, Vanjie.  We love Vanjie.  Oh, wait.  I didn't go to Vanjie.  Hold on.  Vanjie, who lives in Harlem, on the line.  Vanjie, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  All right.  We haven't talked to each other in a long time.  Uh-oh.  You sound upset, Vanjie.  No, like, first of all, why are you talking about, like, we got country roads up here?  What, where did you go through?  No, it's not, it's not country roads.  I think you missed a point.  No.  Wait, wait, no.  I'll be completely honest with you. 
[00:47:30]  When, when, uh, um, a white person like myself, I'll speak for myself.  Go ahead, Opie.  When I'm driving through Harlem, I am scared S-less.  Why?  So, so, so what I do, and, and, and Anthony does it too, we drive through red lights and  get the hell out.  Well, what's this?  Because I don't understand, because I don't understand it.  You know what, there's part of the, let me, let me, let me fill, let me fill you in.  There's part of the, um, you know that, that white conspiracy?  What white conspiracy?  Well, there's a white conspiracy against black people, remember? 
[00:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  See, part of it is we can run through red lights in black neighborhoods and we just wink at  the cops and they let us off the hook.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I had to fill you in on that one.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  But that's part of the white conspiracy.  Oh.  But what streets are you going through that you're so terrified?  You know, when I'm going, like, uh, you know, back up to Boston and visiting stuff,  I just can never find that damn FDR, man.  Oh, we can have a visit.  All of a sudden, I'm like on first av or something, I'm like, oh, oh, there's got to be an exit for 
[00:48:30]  the FDR around here somewhere.  Oh, no, I'm in the hundreds.  Oh, no.  Listen, guys.  Oh, my God.  That's 138th Street.  How'd I get up here?  Right.  Hey, this don't look like Midtown anymore.  Where are the people in the business suits?  Right.  What?  But listen, the street.  Oh, the paranoia that goes through your head.  I'm just being honest with you, Angie.  I really don't know why.  Because you go from east to west on 125th Street. 
[00:49:00]  It's all stores.  You've got Starbucks, Pathmark, and all that stuff.  And it's nice.  So I don't know why you should be terrified.  I don't see the stores.  Because the hour I drive past, all those big grates are down in front of the windows.  Uh-huh.  And stuff.  You know, because they pull down the big locked grates.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I swear, I was driving through there Friday.  It looked like a scene out of my video game Kingpin that I was playing.  Like, it just looked frightening.  You guys exaggerate.  Angie, but we're just being honest. 
[00:49:30]  I swear, there's not much of a bit here.  This is what we do.  The funniest line is Anthony going, oh, my.  That's 120th Street.  Aw, now I'm up in the hundreds.  What happened?  Right.  Where's the bridge, for God's sake?  Right.  I got to cross a bridge to safety.  Well, listen.  I need safety.  Next time, if you come up here, I'll escort you through.  Will you?  And you can walk through and nobody will bother you.  I would like to try that.  But I'm telling you, I'm paranoid.  I mean, there's white people that live up here. 
[00:50:00]  All the way up, Ray.  I don't care.  What's that?  There's white people that live up here.  Oh, no, there's not.  Yes, there is.  Oh, you stop spreading that rumor.  Oh, come on.  For real.  You know that.  Yeah, they're called pimps.  No.  I could be.  Wow.  You're crossing the line.  Isn't that terrible?  Oh, that was just a joke.  No.  Well, you know something?  I don't know much about Harlem.  Because any time I've been up there, it's been at night when I'm driving to get to a bridge.  And I don't really stop and look around. 
[00:50:30]  Believe me.  And I don't make any eye contact.  And I leave about five car lengths in front of me just in case I got to make one of them quick getaway.  Just in case someone, you know, get out the core.  You know?  No, but it's not that bad.  Get out the core.  Well, there's a difference, though, because...  Oh, never mind.  I don't know.  It's bad.  No, it isn't.  In my mind, it's bad.  And I still got my stupid mask plates on, so it's just like, oh, brother, here it is.  Hey, I'm a muck.  Hi.  Hi, brother. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, no, I'm just down from Worcester, Massachusetts.  I need directions to the...  What's that?  Yeah, firearm.  Listen, we're so uncivilized.  We've never seen a white shirt.  Hey, look, I'm raising the roof.  I'm like you, homie.  Can't we all just get a...  Put the knife away.  Could you put...  Please put it away.  Oh, man.  All right.  All stop.  It's all stereotype.  We're just having fun, Vanjie.  I know.  I guess today, there was the Polish people.  Today, it's such equal opportunity.  No, well...  Hey, well, no, let's look. 
[00:51:30]  We did rag the Mexicans earlier in the hour.  Oh, that's right, with the peppers and the men.  And the Hasidic Jews.  There were a couple jokes that came in for those folks today.  Oh.  Okay.  So, no.  Okay, because I was wondering when we were going to get our chats.  Take us up to Harlem one day and give us the tour.  I want to see the Apollo Theater.  I want to see...  Did I say the Apollo Theater?  Yeah.  Well, it...  What else is up there?  If you're going to take us for, like, a drive in your neighborhood, would you mind if we did it in an armored tank?  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now on Malcolm X Boulevard. 
[00:52:00]  If you look to the right, you'll see...  Oh, look at that.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you reach under your seat, you'll find your Kevlar.  Put on your vest and your helmet.  This is for your safety.  As we drive down Malcolm X Boulevard, you may hear whizzing next to your ears, which you might think is a mosquito or a fly.  These are actually small arms fire that are going right past your head.  Do the tour buses really go up there? 
[00:52:30]  No.  Yes, they really do.  Every day.  Okay.  And, of course, we'll be disembarking from the bus to go on the attraction ride here.  It's a roller coaster we call Crack Whore Mountain.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you look to your right, there's Huggy Bear's Wild Ride, where we'll be leaving the bus and going into an authentic 70s-style tentmobile.  Well, pink Cadillac, you'll all get a complimentary hat with a big Worcester feather on it.  Thank you for taking Harlem Tour Lines, where our motto is, it's Ike. 
[00:53:00]  Know what I'm saying?  Mike, what's going on?  How you doing?  All right.  No, I just wanted to tell you guys, like, I'm a cop, and I go home at night at midnight, and I'm scared.  I got a gun on me.  I blow the lights, too.  He has a gun, and he blows the red lights.  You blow all the lights, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Cops got to be pretty cool with that.  Like, if you see some guy blowing lights in a bad neighborhood, and you pull him over or something, it's got to be like, hey, you know, officer, come on. 
[00:53:30]  Look around.  You know, help me out a little bit here.  He's got a little flack.  You know where he's coming from.  Come on.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Well, you know, it is a small percentage of people, but I think the image that some of these towns have,  you know, a little scary.  Let's hear from Starks.  Starks.  Yo, what's up?  You're from Harlem?  No doubt.  Yeah.  Listen, y'all killing me over here, man.  I understand.  What's the matter, Starks?  We're just being honest, though.  We get a little nervous when we drive through Harlem. 
[00:54:00]  What do you want from us?  Yo, I work in the projects, man.  Nothing but nice people in Harlem, you dig?  Yeah.  All right.  Nothing but nice people, man.  Well, help us out.  We'll listen to your side of it.  Has it changed?  I don't know.  Harlem, you got to try to drive it through Harlem, all right?  It's like, it's a different scene now.  It's not like back in the days, you hear stories.  Yeah.  Maybe that was true.  I don't know.  Well, maybe it's changed like Times Square's changed, you know?  There's no more spot in everything.  It's like Disney.  Maybe Harlem's like Disney.  Do you have a Disney store in the middle of Harlem? 
[00:54:30]  Disney.  Not really.  Well, we got Magic Johnson open up everything over there.  Magic Johnson with his movie theaters, right?  Yeah.  Off mark.  I hear they have bulletproof screens at the movie theaters.  Yeah, you're killing me.  You can bust a few caps into the movie.  Hey, Starks.  Yeah?  How far you have to go to get to a Popeye's fried chicken?  There's one up there somewhere.  Yeah, there is.  Yeah.  Well, what...  Popeye's, Kentucky.  What do you want?  Well, Starks, what can you tell Whitey about Harlem that we don't know?  That we don't know.  Listen, y'all got more respect than a regular brother up there. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Trust me, ain't trying to get a bad rap, you know?  Yeah.  Well, check it out.  I work with white boys all the time in Harlem.  They cool.  They can hang.  So we should just come up, visit and stuff?  Why not?  Check it out.  Bring plenty of cash?  You think we could do a live broadcast from the middle of Harlem?  Yeah, come to Starbucks.  Starbucks.  Starbucks.  You guys will walk by laughing at us.  Look at the white boys in Starbucks.  Yeah, right? 
[00:55:30]  White boys.  Well, I don't know why they put a Starbucks in Harlem.  I don't think we could afford it.  We have to be educated, you know?  We're ignorant.  We are ignorant.  We got to get up there and then take a look around because I'm just going off of what I heard  and what I see when I'm driving through very late at night.  It's very scary.  Right.  Yeah, what's the deal with that cop talking about he's scared?  He is.  He's going to get the hell out of Harlem then.  He says he's scared when he drives home.  He has a gun.  He goes for the red lights too.  Yeah, he's full of s**t.  He's only going 150 if he gets some head.  Starks, you got some chops to you, man. 
[00:56:00]  We want to hang with you.  You call back any time.  All right, no problem, dude.  You're funny though, man.  Yeah.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thanks, Starks.  All right.  Bye.  Starks trying to give us the other side of it.  We obviously, Opie, we don't know anything about Harlem.  We don't spend time up there.  How can we make any kind of a sense?  That's what we're pretty much proving here.  Rosa, very pissed off at us.  Rosa.  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  Well, I mean, I'm black. 
[00:56:30]  I'm from Harlem.  What's the deal?  And you're listening to our show?  Yeah.  Man, I think that's awesome.  Somebody got to listen to it.  So help us out.  We don't understand Harlem is what we're pretty much saying here today.  Yeah.  Why is it that you don't understand Harlem?  The people up there, it's just the skin is dark.  We're naive white boys.  We don't know about up there.  What is it that you don't know?  What do you want to know?  We get the image like a lot of people have that it's very scary.  And if you go up there, something bad will happen to you.  Well, I was born and raised up there. 
[00:57:00]  And there's nothing going on up there.  People trying to survive.  What do you think?  You're black.  So, and you're white.  And your point.  So if we go up there, it's like, are we going to be looked at as victims?  Oh, please.  Is somebody going to look at you like a victim?  Are you walking up there with guns and stuff?  No.  You know, I don't know.  If I'm walking around and we just want to find the FDR, that's all.  You don't know where the FDR is?  No.  Honest to God, all of a sudden I'm in the hundreds and I'm getting really scared and  I don't see a big sign for the FDR.  Well, I mean, I can't see why y'all have a problem. 
[00:57:30]  I mean, I know people live there who are white and live in Harlem.  Well, you're shining some light on the situation today.  We've got to go up there.  You've just got to be open-minded and stop listening to the same old crap all the time.  All right, Rosa.  All right, guys.  Y'all be cool.  We're going to try to understand it.  That's all.  That's why we brought it up on the show today.  We've got to get up there, man.  All right.  That's what you do.  You've got to do a broadcast from up there.  All right.  We'll do that.  All right.  All right, Rosa.  Bye.  Bye, Rosa.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's happening?  Hey.  I can tell you guys, I've been up here 14 years. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah?  They love the white boys.  The girls down there, they know one thing.  Benefits.  You know?  They love your ass for that.  And the brothers down there, they stay clear.  They don't know if you're 5-0 or not.  I'm early.  You can walk the streets, bro.  Yeah?  In and out of the buildings.  They don't do a thing to you.  You know, in stocks, man, stocks, you're cool, bro, but you're lying.  There ain't nobody working in the projects.  All right?  They use the same garbage on the back of the truck and ride around and around and around. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  Oh, man.  See, this is the kind of stuff we hear, so we don't know what the real deal is.  Oh, it's all right, though.  I have no problem going up there.  I'll go up there.  Oh, man.  We'll work something out.  Ain't nobody going to bother you up there.  We're going to bring, like, a DAT recorder,  and we're going to record our day in Harlem.  That's it, man.  You want to do it?  It'll be like the Blair Witch Project.  We'll find the tape years later.  And it's the day nobody going to come to me.  What was that?  All right, man. 
[00:59:00]  All right, man.  Josh!  All right, man.  Josh!  All right, man.  Thank you.  Oh!  Oh!  Wow, that's funny, man.  It's a pile of crack pipes outside our tent.  What does it mean?  I'm sorry I came up here.  I'm sorry.  What is that?  Oh, my God. 
[00:59:30]  What's that sound?  Oh, my God.  Josh!  Josh!  Josh!  Josh!  Oh, man.  I can't breathe.  What a mess. 
[01:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, if you read the paper today, Popeye's getting married.  I got married to Olive's girl.  Yeah, she's a looker, huh?  Oh, she's quite the looker.  What do you...  Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Now, Popeye, what do you see in Olive Oil?  I mean, she really doesn't have a body.  Well, she's slenska.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[01:00:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Some pussky.  What?  What?  Pussky.  What is pussky?  Oh.  Figs get right out yourself.  Oh, God, God, God, God, God, God.  Olive's girl has a love-glee pussky.  Oh, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God.  Oh.  Popeye, I don't think you can say pussky on the radio.  Put my mighty hands around her skinny little butts.  Oh.  Her skinny butts.  And then I gazed into her Pusky. 
[01:01:00]  You can't say Pusky on the radio.  I could say whatever I want.  I'm Popeye.  Pusky, Pusky, Pusky.  Well, blow me down.  She spent all that time with Brutusk.  I thought she was going to stretch out her Pusky.  Popeye, you're going to get us fired. 
[01:01:30]  I guess you're peckskin' quite the punch guy in.  You can't get fired for the word Pusky.  It ain't even a word.  I've never heard the word Pusky before.  It's a fun word to say.  Pusky.  It looks like you're excited because you're going to finally be able to bed down olive oil. 
[01:02:00]  We're going to go on a Hunskey moon.  I'm going to tixker on my boatsk.  I'm Popeye the sailor.  She's a little flat chest kid.  Yeah, just a little.  A little shy in the titsky section.  Not too big on the titskies.  You can't say.  But she makes up for it with the Pusky.  And that narrow little ask. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  She's got quite the lips to ask on her.  But I'm dreaming of the Pusky.  Oh, well, blow me down.  Oh, well, I'm going to get a hold of that in the hotel's room.  Hey, Popeye, I was always wondering this question.  Yes?  Does your unit get really big when you eat the spinach like your biceps?  Of course.  And I got a big tattoo of an anchor on it.  Oh. 
[01:03:00]  Oh.  And it disappears sometimes.  Whenever it ventures towards the Pusky.  Hey, all right.  Come on.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You just can't say that word on the radio.  Oh, God.  Why not?  I don't know.  Look up Pusky in the dictionary.  Is he allowed to say Pusky?  Oh, God.  I could say whatever I want.  I ain't no big Wusky, and I'll say Pusky.  I'm Pop's guy, the sailor man.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Hey, well, there you have it. 
[01:03:30]  I ain't no big Wusky or Pusky.  It's never seen Pusky.  Oh.  All right.  Well, congratulate me.  Are you going to invite Brutus?  No.  I'm not inviting Brutus.  To the wedding, no?  He might try to steal me girls.  I see.  He's always doing that in the past.  What about, uh...  And Olives would always go with her.  What about Wimpy?  And Slutsk.  What about Wimpy?  Oh, Wimps...  Wimpski?  Yeah.  He's a homosexual.  Always in a search for meat. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, good, good.  I'll gladly pay you today for a hamburger tomorrow.  Or whatever the hell's you used to say.  Wow, Wimpy's a homosexual, huh?  Wimpy's a homosexual.  And Olive Oil has a nice, uh...  Olive's girl was a whore until she married me.  I see.  And now it's just me and Olive's Pusky.  Oh.  Oh, got to give her some implants. 
[01:04:30]  Because she's a little shy in the titskies.  You said that already.  Oh.  All right.  Well, do you want to hang out with us for the rest of the show, Popeye?  I'll stay, but I gots to go to my Hunsky moon.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm rip-roaring, look-skin-forward to some Pusky.  Oh.  Wow.  All right.  Where did Anthony go?  He doesn't like Popeye or something?  Oh. 
[01:05:00]  Opie, by far the most effed-up individual on the O&A show.  I'm pulling out my junk.  Hey, kids, this is called black comedy.  But you think your life is in the crapper?  Yeah.  What's the O&A?  That's his worst.  1027.  WMW.  It's a very, very sad day. 
[01:05:30]  We lost a great one.  An icon.  An icon.  Television icon.  Television icon.  They're saying there wouldn't have been a cop's or world's dangerous animals.  Oh, really?  If there wasn't first Alan Funt and Candy Camera, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  I used to watch it all the time.  Alan Funt dead at the age of 84.  Do we have any of his music?  Yeah.  Wayne is least expected.  You're elected.  You're the star today.  Yeah.  Smile.  You're on Candid Camera.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  That's right.  I remember that.  Look at that.  I'm tearing up.  We took our Candid Camera and put it here in a casket where my corpse will be rotting.  Don't be surprised if sometime, somewhere, someone steps up to you and says,  Hey, Alan, you're dead.  That's so wrong.  Why?  He'd probably like that.  They should do, like, a final Candid Camera stunt with him. 
[01:06:30]  With Alan Funt in the casket?  Here I am in a casket.  In a funeral parlor.  But that isn't a funeral, director.  It's actually Fanny Flann, playing the bumbling funeral director.  Watch the horror of my grieving family as she knocks the casket over.  And embalming fluid pours out of my ass.  Oh, look at that.  See?  It just splashed Fanny in the face. 
[01:07:00]  Here I am after a few days of rotting.  They put me out on the street against a lamppost like a bump.  Look at the horror of the people passing by as they smell the stench of rotting death.  See, that woman just fell down.  Isn't that funny?  Hey, the cop on the corner is played by Maury Amsterdam. 
[01:07:30]  After a week, my limbs are falling off.  Watch as someone drives their car around the block with my legs sticking out the bottom of the car door.  I'm dead.  I was pretty fat toward the end.  I had an Alan Funt bunt.  He was always getting in on the act. 
[01:08:00]  Now, in addition to candid kids,  watch in horror as my head is on a table of a kindergarten class.  The kids screaming in horror.  Oh, an extra treat.  A bird's pecking out my eyeballs.  Look at the screaming in horror of the children. 
[01:08:30]  Well, Anthony, that's not the way I want to remember Alan Funt.  Well, I think you would like to be involved in one last stunt like that.  One last Kenny camera stunt?  One last candid camera.  Come on.  What's Fanny Flagg?  As the funeral director, huh?  Watch as they put me in a gay bar as a passed-out gay man,  and I take it in the keister.  Come on.  You want to tune in?  What is it, Weekend at Bernie's with Alan Funt starring? 
[01:09:00]  Weekend at Alan's.  Come on.  Here we are in a bowling alley.  Watch the horror of the bowler as their ball knocks the pins down,  but my head comes back in the ball return.  Oops, watch my eyes.  Come on, you wouldn't watch.  Well, I remember this.  Al, what's up?  Yeah, he made a couple of X-rated candy cameras.  Yeah, he made a video store. 
[01:09:30]  What was that?  It was on Playboy Channel or something.  Unless there was other ones that people forgot about  where I administered the jackhammer to certain people.  Watch as Fanny Flagg is bent over a table  as I pound her with the jackhammer.  In this next clip,  people pass by an ordinary lobby of a dental office  as Adrian Barbeau gives Jimmy Stewart a rusty trombone. 
[01:10:00]  Look at the horror.  Don't be surprised if sometimes, somewhere,  someone steps up to you and says,  Hey, bitch, cover your gash.  Watch the fun as this crack whore dies swallowing her own vomit.  Laugh along with Fanny Flagg and Maury Amsterdam. 
[01:10:30]  Well, there he goes.  Godspeed, Alan.  Godspeed.  Alan Funt dead at the age of 84, Anthony.  Yeah.  Our haunting tribute.  Don't be surprised if sometime, somewhere,  someone steps up to you and says,  Hey, Alan, you're dead.  We were talking about this yesterday. 
[01:11:00]  Celine Dion, she's retiring.  Stop.  Don't even talk about it, Obey.  I get all to a gum.  Yeah, Celine.  Which is a complete joke.  She's going to go away for two years,  and then she's going to come back.  She's going to be bigger and better than ever  for all those fat housewives.  Her big comeback.  She'll have her big comeback.  She's not retiring forever.  She's too young.  There's nothing else she's going to do.  No.  She's going to try to start a family.  Yeah, she'll be back.  So Oprah Winfrey made a huge deal about this.  Oh, oh, stop. 
[01:11:30]  Was it yesterday?  On yesterday's show, they had Celine Dion.  Oh.  I hate this song, man.  This is dedicated to the people of the Titanic.  All of those who perished.  Every night in the morning.  Beneath the icy waters of the North Atlantic,  I send this song out to all the people  and to the survivors.  Those who were able to live on with their lives 
[01:12:00]  after the great ship went down.  You stole another bit from me, you bastard.  Yeah, that's obvious, man.  I used to do that one, man.  I don't do many.  Come on.  The brave people who could survive the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  In their boats, watching the mighty Titanic  slowly slip beneath the surface of the water.  This song goes out to them.  The survivors.  Anyway. 
[01:12:30]  But she sings perfectly.  What a tool.  Her voice is all effed up, but she sings perfectly.  Yeah.  Perfect English.  Listen to her.  Anyway, do we have the letter from the Oprah Winfrey show?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, where is it?  Please.  So here it is.  It was a tear fest on Oprah yesterday.  And they read this letter from this guy.  Well, we're going to mock this guy.  So I want to say in advance that he's okay now.  Yeah, he's okay.  It's just, I mean, I don't care what you got.  I'm sorry about that.  But you sound like the biggest pussy in the world. 
[01:13:00]  This guy does sound like the biggest pussy in the world.  And during the cry fest,  they had this guy read his letter that he sent to Celine.  We've received a lot of mail from viewers  who've been moved by Celine's music.  Brian Kloos was watching our show the last time Celine was here  and wrote us this letter.  Take a look.  Dear Oprah,  I'm sitting in my hospital room  going through a bone marrow transplant for lymphoma.  I'm a grown man crying  after watching Celine Dion sing the theme to Titanic on your show.  She loved me. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, Celine.  Celine.  I found out about Celine in one of your previous shows  and fell in love with her music, voice,  and great attitude for life and family.  And camel top.  At that time,  I was just diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Ow.  Hearing Celine sing some of her songs had me bawling.  Her song,  Because You Loved Me,  couldn't have hit home more perfectly 
[01:14:00]  about the way I feel about my wife, Kathy.  Listening to the song,  wasn't sure where my future was going,  how I was going to survive the cancer  and fight it and things like that.  It just really hit home.  After the show,  I went right out and bought the CD  and gave it to my wife.  To this day,  Kathy and I can't listen to the song  Because You Loved Me without crying.  She's a strong, loving woman.  She's a special, special lady.  Special lady.  So, I couldn't imagine a day without her. 
[01:14:30]  She's everything to me.  Brian and Kathy,  we thought your letter was sweet.  We wanted to do something special for you.  So,  you're going to her final performance.  Oh!  Listen to Ulta.  I am so happy for you guys. 
[01:15:00]  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're going to be there  for the final performance.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  You know,  I got to jump in here.  God forbid I was, you know,  had a cancer scare, Anthony. 
[01:15:30]  God forbid, really.  And, you know,  like this guy,  he decided he needs to go see Celine Dion.  Yeah.  You know what would be better than that?  Being able to watch Oprah  at Sunday brunch.  Yeah, that's what you want to say.  Oh, if I had my choice.  If I had my choice, Anthony.  Went through all the chemo, you know.  My hair's in patches all over my head.  Oh.  Am I going to see Celine Dion sing the Titanic song?  No.  I want to see Oprah Winfrey at Sunday brunch. 
[01:16:00]  That's when I know Oprah cares.  I want to see Celine.  Jesus.  Oh, more Celine.  I don't want...  Oh, he's sensitive.  I want to be home  and do some cooking  and stay home  and have no schedule  and no pressure  and say,  let's go for a picnic  and drive my own car  and pick my own tomatoes.  Pick my own tomatoes  and give myself a frontal wedgie  every day. 
[01:16:30]  It looks like I have ass in the front.  Buy some new yo-yos  for the front of my pants.  My pants sink deeper than the Titanic  in the front.  A crevice in the front  when I wear my jump pants  that is deeper than the crevice  made by the iceberg  in the mighty bow of the Titanic.  It actually looks like  I was straddling the iceberg  and the bow of the Titanic  struck me right in my camel toe.  That's what made this big gully 
[01:17:00]  when I wear my tight jumpsuit.  You see my tight jumpsuit  and my pelvis bones  that jet out?  I am the iceberg.  The Titanic slammed into my crotch  at approximately 12 knots.  The man in the crow's nest yelled,  Hamilton, dead ahead!  But the mighty Titanic  could not stop.  It hit my groin at 12 knots,  ripping open many watertight compartments  and leaving me  with a hatchet wound  unlike no other. 
[01:17:30]  This goes out to the survivors  who, before they sank,  before they got into their lifeboats,  were able to take one last look  in the lights of the distress flares  and see my camel toe.  The camel toe  that brought down  the mighty Titanic  on her maiden voyage.  Can you believe it? 
[01:18:00]  Who thought  a gash could bring down  a mighty ocean liner  like the Titanic?  They called it unsinkable.  Now, Celine,  how many people  lost their lives  in your crotch?  I believe it was  750 people  died  because of  my camel toe. 
[01:18:30]  If you look,  some nights  when I am in concert  with my tight jumpsuit,  you can see  on each thigh  HMS Titanic  and anchor wounds.  Now I know  why Leonardo DiCaprio's  face was blue.  It was from the smell.  Hold on, Jack!  The ship thought  unsinkable  and iceberg-proof  not to be 
[01:19:00]  camel toe-proof.  The yo-yo ice muggle  could take down  the Queen Mary.  But that  goes out  to the survivors.  Those who are  able to live on  and make their dreams  come true  and get the  nightmarish image  of my groin  out of their head  forever.  I'm quitting show business.  Uh, Fred!  Anthony has a serious  future as a Celine Dion  impersonator.  When you say the word 
[01:19:30]  survivor,  this song  is dedicated  to  the Titanic  and its  fearless crew  and passengers.  Not just those  that perished  in the icy waters  of the North Atlantic,  but also  to the survivors.  All right, Fred,  that's funny.  God damn it,  is that funny, man?  I don't even care 
[01:20:00]  if anyone else  is laughing.  That is,  that's some  top-shelf stuff  right there, man.  That is,  that's where  it's at.  All right,  because of that  Celine Dion bit,  that went on  for 20 minutes,  we have to go  to commercials again.  A commercial break.  We apologize.  I am not going  to sing anymore.  Opie,  Anthony,  if I may just  cut in for a moment.  Yeah.  Of course,  you know I am  ending my singing career.  Yeah.  I have made people 
[01:20:30]  very happy with my voice,  but I am stopping  for a time  so I may do  other things.  These things  that I am doing  will help people also.  I am going to be hired  by the  National Baseball Association.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  Yes.  Baseball will need me  to model the new  catcher's mitt  out of,  out of my private area  because it looks like  I have a catcher's mitt  down the front  of my jumpsuit.  And, of course,  look for me  at high schools 
[01:21:00]  as the bicycle rack.  I will be appearing  on the next Fox special  with Robbie Knievel  Oh, really?  Yes, he is going  to jump  my mighty hatchet wound.  You've seen him  many times  try to jump  school buses  and whatnot.  Yeah.  This is the most  dangerous jump  of them all.  I believe it would be  a brand new world record.  Yes, from labia  to labia.  Okay, thank you.  Very difficult.  All right,  thank you, Celine.  And I will be doing  a new movie.  A new movie, huh? 
[01:21:30]  Yes.  Celine will be  in the new Batman movie.  Oh, yeah?  My genitals will be  in the new Batcave.  Shut up.  Shut up!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  You guys have 
[01:22:00]  superior ratings  to beyond belief  right now.  The OVN  Anthony Show.  Thank you.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  And used to pick up  a little CB horse.  This was...  Come on, man.  Remember the big  CB radio craze?  I was like in my  early teens.  And it was a way  to get girls, you know?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:22:30]  Breaker, Breaker 1-9.  Go ahead, good buddy.  Yeah, Breaker for a radio check.  You're coming in  four by four, good buddy.  Thank you.  And then you're sitting there  like, what else can I say?  Come back.  I'm 10-10-10-8  on the side  waiting for you,  good buddy.  Yeah.  Because I didn't drive,  so what was the use?  You're just sitting in there.  It can't be like, you know...  I'm double nickels  all the way. 
[01:23:00]  Looking out  for the Smokies.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  We got some  pretty seat covers  here today.  Down the old  blacktop  keeper between the ditches.  Good buddy.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  I did that.  What else can I say?  I'm just on the CB.  What was your handle, Ant?  Oh, I got to explain this.  This just never...  Explaining never works  on this show, does it?  I was living in California 
[01:23:30]  at the time,  and I was very equestrian.  I had a horse,  and I used to ride  and my handle,  because I ran a rent string.  This guy I knew  had a rent string,  so he used to take  these Marines  from Camp Pendleton  that wanted to be a cowboy  for the weekend  and guide them up in the hills.  So I was like the guide.  And I'd take them up there  and then go down,  back down the hill  and get the next batch  and bring them up.  And so I was the wrangler 
[01:24:00]  with you.  Hey, good buddy.  You got the wrangler.  Good buddy.  The butt wrangler.  Ah, shut up.  What was your handle?  Uh, Diamond Dust.  Diamond Dust?  Fang!  That's worse than...  What's Diamond Dust?  That's worse than Butt Wrangler?  It wasn't Butt Wrangler.  It was the wrangler.  Because a wrangler  was a guy on a horse  that got together 
[01:24:30]  the livestock.  Diamond Dust?  I don't know.  Hey, you got the Diamond Dust.  Hello, Diamond Dust.  Butt plug, you out there?  Good buddy?  Go ahead with your little cute story.  What?  Got your ears on?  This is a rubber duck.  A rubber duck, did you?  Big fan, come on.  You shake the trees  and I'll rake the leaves  good, buddy.  For sure, for sure.  Oh, God.  Clean, clear the flag.  Oh, God. 
[01:25:00]  I'm kidding.  Oh, shut this off.  Yeah, we definitely  got the front door.  Yeah, buddy.  We got us a convoy.  We got a convoy.  I was a kid  looking for chicks.  Were you in a roller skate?  Hey, is it  a chick in a roller skate?  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hey, take her down  to Double Nickels  up by the interstate,  good buddy.  We got a Kojak  with a Kodak.  Good buddy,  taking pictures,  giving away invitations. 
[01:25:30]  I'll be back.  I got to go  10-100.  Yeah.  Did you see any  Tijuana taxis out there?  We got us  a Tijuana taxi.  Whoa, I just got  passed by a crazy man  on a crash rocket.  You better watch out  for the Smokies.  All right, come on,  everybody.  All right, all right.  Meet you up  with the Chokin' Pukes. 
[01:26:00]  All right, the Wrangler.  Well, explain  the rest of your story.  So then there was  this girl  that I used to  communicate with  on the Citizens Band,  and her handle  was Dreamweaver.  You dick.  Oh, Rick had to get  the song and everything.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver,  this is the Wrangler.  You got your ears on?  And she sounded hot. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  So I invited her  down to ride horses.  It's a key,  ladies and gentlemen.  She sounded hot.  What did he look like,  Ed?  Oh, shut up.  All right, go ahead.  So I was all excited  for my little date,  and I saddled up  my horse  and the other horse  and kind of  shut up.  Dreamweaver.  I'll meet you down  at the stable  at 2 o'clock 
[01:27:00]  in the afternoon.  This is the Wrangler  over and out.  Dreamweaver.  You're an ass, man.  I saddled up my horse  and I spent time  brushing the horses,  making sure they look  all good and everything.  And then I saddle up  the other horse  and I take the reins  and put her on the saddle horn  and I'm kind of  trailering the other horse,  you know,  down to meet her  by the riverbed  where we were going to ride.  Well, 
[01:27:30]  she comes  walking up  and I see kind of  in the distance  and I'm like,  okay, that must be her.  All right, now, wait, wait.  Now, you did say  that you had the 10  and everything  and you were hoping  to score in the woods, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I packed like a whole thing.  Saddlebags are all packed up  with a couple of beers  and I had bedrolls  and a tent  just in case things went well  because we had a bunch  of hills to ride up in  and stuff.  I'm going to camp out  with my Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver,  tell your mom 
[01:28:00]  you're going to be  spending the night,  Dreamweaver.  Tell her you're  at a friend's house  because we're going  to camp out.  This is the Wrangler  over and out of 10-10-10-8  on the side,  Dreamweaver.  Looking forward  to my little date.  Yeah.  Well, she comes up.  Even before I was  gravely disappointed,  the horse that had  a carrier looked pissed.  I wasn't sure  if I should take  the saddle off of the horse,  put it on her  and let the horse  ride her.  Dreamweaver. 
[01:28:30]  She was huge.  Alright.  Yes, I was  gravely disappointed.  Dreamweaver.  I'm a dreamweaver.  I'm a dreamweaver.  Are you a Wrangler? 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  Please don't be  dreamweaver.  I'm dreamweaver.  Alright, let's  go for a ride.  So we went like  up and down the riverbed  for about an hour.  I was like,  oh, look at the time.  Here I had like  bedrolls on the back  of this thing.  It was like,  I was Paul Ingalls  going up to  Walnut Grove.  I was going to go  over the river  for a week  to go get supplies  for the family.  I mean,  I had this thing  packed out  like a pack mule.  You were ready to rock.  I was like a prospector. 
[01:29:30]  I had crap  hanging off the horse.  Oh, look at the time.  You were ready to rock.  I was ready to rock.  You were a dreamweaver.  I had firearms.  I was going to hunt  her food.  And I realized  looking at it,  I'd need to beg a moose.  So, you know,  we used to hunt.  You hunt little rabbits  and stuff.  Feeding the heart  would be forget about it.  Gee, okay.  No, there's not many  bison left on the plane.  I could live off  your thigh  for a couple of weeks.  I can't breathe.  Oh, it was horrid.  I was so disappointed 
[01:30:00]  because she's talking  that she, you know,  oh, yeah.  I look like Tatum O'Neill.  Yeah, sure you do.  Great.  So I let her,  you know,  I let her off  and she rode off  into the distance.  You didn't do the drive-by?  How are you going to do  a drive-by on horseback?  Well, I'm the only guy  with two horses,  one empty.  Are you wrangling?  No.  No, just looking  for another girl.  You should have tried  to, like,  meet her in town 
[01:30:30]  or something,  did the drive-by  to see what she looked like.  The whole thing was riding up  like Clint friggin' Eastwood, dude.  I understand.  I had the whole look.  You've got to remember something.  I'm a kid.  I'm, like,  maybe 13 years old.  And this was  mid-70s.  I had cowboy attire on.  Believe me,  this was in San Juan,  Capistrano, California.  A very equestrian town.  Used to ride.  This was what we did.  You know?  And I'm like,  I had firearms on me.  I swear to God,  I had a pistol. 
[01:31:00]  Just in case I had a fight  for her honor  for any bandoleros.  Meanwhile,  they'd have been,  you keep her.  We'd no honor.  Maybe she could pull the wagon.  Oh, man.  But this was like,  I was so pumped up for this  and so was she.  Pumped up.  But, uh,  yeah,  it was very disappointing.  But,  to bring it all back  to the beginning of this story,  she was a girl.  All right.  I haven't laughed at her  in a while.  My eyes are teared. 
[01:31:30]  This song brings back  memories every time I hear it.  I gotta tell you,  to this day,  when I hear Dreamweaver,  I think of the whole day  how happy I was  and psyched  and how disappointed I was  riding back to the ranch  that day.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Very good story, Ann.  Thank you, Woppy.  Woppy.  Keep your hands  or waste me a pant.  Ah, too late.  And Anthony.  I'm just a flaming fag.  More stupidity  on the way.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:32:00]  2757 1027.  It's the O&A show.  Bunch of ladies on hold.  They want to play  What's in My Pants  and they look like  African princesses.  Yes, good.  We've never done this before.  I want to hear what the  different in the sound is.  We'll talk to them  in a sec,  but you got something?  Yeah.  You know that contest,  I guess,  M&M's is running?  If you open up M&M's  and it's various colors  in there that aren't  the normal M&M colors,  you could win a million bucks.  It seems an inmate  at the Purgatory  Correctional Facility  in Utah.  Thought he won. 
[01:32:30]  You got this bag of M&M's  for helping out  with the chores.  God, prison must really suck.  There you go.  You're going to mop up  inmate crap  from the toilet.  Yeah.  And here's a bag  of M&M's for you.  You got the M&M's  from the vending machine,  Anthony,  on the way back  to his cell,  I guess, huh?  No, they actually,  one of the guards  gave it to him  for doing such a good job  cleaning up.  So they gave him  a little bag of M&M's.  Cleaning up what?  Yeah, I know.  So he opens it up  and he sees all kinds  of different colors  that he's not used to. 
[01:33:00]  And the other inmates,  see, I wouldn't have known  better.  I'd have eaten them, right?  Yeah.  The other inmates are like,  oh, you might have,  I think you won a million bucks.  That's the contest.  Because he saw blue ones  and the yellow ones,  the colors that aren't  part of the M&M's.  And it's a fix-up  the mix-up contest  or something like that.  So it said  he's a first prize winner.  And the prize,  the big prize  is a million dollars.  So there you go.  First prize winner.  Right.  That means I won  a million dollars.  So there's a little bit  of an outrage  that a guy in prison  is winning 
[01:33:30]  the million dollar  M&M prize.  But it turns out,  Opie,  that first prize  is first prize.  He did not win  the grand prize,  which is a million dollars.  But wouldn't it be,  wouldn't the grand prize  be first prize?  No, it must be like  first runner-up.  Oh, okay.  You know?  First prize  is not grand prize.  Grand prize,  million dollars.  Million dollars.  Now you gotta think  first prize,  it's gotta be pretty good,  right?  Yeah.  It's a free 16-ounce bag  of M&M's. 
[01:34:00]  That is your name.  Goddamn Cartman.  That rocks.  Yeah, so he didn't win.  He won a free bag  of M&M's.  Yes.  Thinking you got  a million bucks  and you got a bag  of M&M's.  That's too bad.  Mother efforts.  That's kind of like 
[01:34:30]  thinking you won  a hundred grand,  Anthony,  and it turns out  to be a candy bar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Yeah!  We won!  We won!  We won!  I'm gonna buy  a truck.  I've got a piece  of crap for truck.  I'm gonna get  a new one.  I'm gonna get  a new truck.  A new truck.  How are you gonna  do that with a candy bar?  What?  What?  What?  What a tool.  Now we gotta play  the damn thing. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, it's quick.  I love it.  Rick, get that real fast.  It's along the same lines.  This guy must have been like,  damn!  The guy, by the way,  is only serving  one year  for attempted  possession  of methamphetamine.  How does that?  How do you get  attempted possession?  I grabbed for it.  Attempted possession?  I didn't reach it  and they arrested me.  Yeah, what's that?  Attempted possession?  I guess he was trying  to buy it,  but attempted possession.  You attempted to possess.  Don't you have to have  the drugs on you, though?  I guess not anymore.  You could get arrested 
[01:35:30]  for conspiracy  to deal.  Like, say you're in a bar  and somebody comes up to you  and goes,  hey, you know where  I could get some blow?  And you go,  um, I think that guy  in the corner.  Ugh.  And they go,  just off the hand,  you just go,  I think that guy  in the corner gets some.  And he goes over  and gets some blow off of that.  You get arrested  for conspiracy.  You're effed?  You're effed.  Ugh.  I know someone  that happened to.  It just,  he pointed to somebody  in the bar.  I think we've all  been asked, too.  Where can I get some blow off?  You just shut your mouth, man.  I don't know.  Ugh. 
[01:36:00]  Arrested for conspiracy.  All right, Anthony,  here's our  100 grand prank call, okay?  Right.  Hi.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig  from Waltham.  Hey, Craig,  guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  Oh, no way!  He did it!  I won!  I won!  Oh, no way!  You're kidding, right?  107th.  Oh, wow!  107th caller,  congratulations.  100 grand!  Oh, my God!  You just won  100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what  I'm going to do with that?  What are you going to do  with 100 grand? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, man, the first thing,  I have this old...  Oh, I cannot...  Jesus, I've got to calm down.  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner!  I'm the winner!  Well, what are you going  to do with 100 grand?  I got this...  Oh, man,  I got this s*** box  for a truck.  I've got to get a new one.  A new truck.  Oh, that...  Oh.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going  to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going  to do that with a candy bar?  We just gave you  a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What? 
[01:37:00]  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f***  you've been saying?  I've been listening  to f***ing radio  for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are  fucking two days.  Hey!  Hey!  Congratulations, man.  Oh, no.  I think it's funny.  I mean, hey.  Well, yeah, we pulled 
[01:37:30]  that little prank  on somebody.  Yeah.  Let's go to Amanda.  Amanda?  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, Matt, what?  Oh, yeah.  You're a sister.  Fine.  Ebony princess.  We can tell by the voice.  We've played this game  many times in the past.  We don't feel like  playing today,  so don't challenge us,  but we can just tell  from the voice.  Okay.  There's a certain dialect  that the people  of African descent have.  It's just like  anything else.  If you see,  like a lot of people  in the Jewish community,  you can tell 
[01:38:00]  by the way they talk  that they're Jewish.  It's just the way.  Italians.  You go to Brooklyn  and you start talking  to an Italian,  you're not going to know  he's Italian  by the way he's talking.  Hey, come on, huh?  What are you talking about?  Hey, where's my eye rock?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Hey, come on, nooch.  You know?  It's nothing bad.  It's nothing.  Some people would have you  believe that that's bad  to even say it.  It's just the way it is.  Yeah, we've played  this game in the past.  We're like 90% correct  on guessing nationalities 
[01:38:30]  by just the voice.  So what kind of sister  are you, Amanda?  I am a mutt  who's in college.  You're a mutt.  I'm a mutt.  That's the best way  to put it.  What's your background?  My mom's side  comes from Europe  for the most part.  There's a lot of French  but my dad's side  is mostly Haitian.  Haitian.  So you are a mulatto?  Yeah.  See, we want dark.  Yeah, we need...  We want...  Like... 
[01:39:00]  We want, like...  Like...  I want right off...  Right from Nigeria.  Yeah, we want...  You know?  We want...  If we're going to play  What's in My Pants  with a sister,  we want dark.  Yeah.  How light are...  How dark are you?  Cafe latte?  Yeah.  We're looking for, like,  black coffee.  Yeah.  Sorry, no black coffee here.  I want a girl that, like,  you see on the Discovery Channel.  That type of African woman.  We're looking right off the boat.  We're looking for grape soda.  Oh, wow.  I'm talking real. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  You're lost.  All right.  I think we're going to let you go.  You're not dark enough.  Okay.  But thank you for, you know,  calling up the show today.  You know the shows that you watch  on Discovery  with the guys that wear  the big cones on their...  The big carrot sticks  on their schweens.  Yeah, it sticks out like...  And they hunt monkeys.  Yeah, it sticks out three feet.  Yeah.  And the women are walking around  and they're, like,  making the soup out of grubs.  Yeah.  And they're, like,  nursing a kid.  And, you know,  they're weaving things. 
[01:40:00]  There's flies all over.  You ever see that  on Discovery Channel?  Sure have, Anthony.  If that's what we want.  That's it.  If you have...  If you have...  If you have ancestors  that still, you know,  use...  to communicate...  That's what we're looking for today  to play...  Guess What's in My Pants.  Right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Let's see if Elizabeth qualifies  on line of nine.  Elizabeth!  Unfortunately, I don't. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, really?  Why?  How dark are you?  I'm, like, a Carmel.  Oh, we're looking  for Florida Evans.  No, I'm a Jamaican girl.  That's the role.  I'm Jamaican Carmel.  Wow, that's hot, though, Ann.  Are we going hot  or dark?  Well, dark is hot, too, though.  We gotta go the whole route.  You got darker and picky.  You started out,  you want black,  now you want off the boat.  What do you think?  All right, hold on.  Let's see if anyone's darker  than you on the line, okay? 
[01:41:00]  We want Amistad.  I'm talking dark.  We're talking Manute Bull.  Mickey Rivers.  Mickey Rivers.  That type of dark.  Let's see how dark Tracy is, though.  What do I say?  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, Tracy.  What's up?  What's up, ONA?  How are you?  I'm chilling.  Oh, you sound dark.  Yes, I am dark, baby.  You sound dark.  Yeah.  I'm the black coffee  you've been looking for.  Oh, man.  Ah, yeah.  Ah, yeah.  Tell us a little bit  about yourself.  Well, um, 
[01:41:30]  uh, 34, 24, 36.  You got that, eh?  Yes, I do.  Mm-hmm.  Baby got back.  Yes, he does.  Yeah.  And how dark are you?  You're talking as dark  as black coffee, or?  Um, I'm not so dark.  I'm dark complexion, yeah,  but I'm not gonna go  as far as for, like,  that model or whatever  who's, like, she's black.  Now, what about  the hair on your head?  Oh, I have, like,  straight hair.  Straight hair?  Like, my shoulders.  Is it natural  or are you processed?  It's processed, baby.  You know. 
[01:42:00]  What happens  when you don't do  any process?  Well, I get my hair  done, like, once every week.  Look like Kizzy?  No.  Ha, no.  That's funny.  It don't get, like, nappy,  but it gets, like, curly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So you sound dark.  I'll put some coffee  in your cream.  Ah.  Yeah, now we're talking.  There you go.  All right, hold on, Chasey.  Okay.  Let me just try Laundra.  There's some possibilities here.  Laundra.  Laundra.  Hey.  What's up, Laundra?  How you doing? 
[01:42:30]  Hi.  Hi.  How the hell  are you gonna name Laundra?  Oh, ask my parents.  I don't know.  Ask her parents.  Ask her parents.  I gotta do  the Laundra today.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You guys got some fun names, man.  Yeah, I think I'm what you're looking for.  Yeah, how dark are you?  Almost like a licorice stick.  Whoa, that's all right.  It's a bell.  Yeah.  All right, so we got black licorice, Anthony.  Yeah, that's good.  That's what we were looking for.  Give us a visual. 
[01:43:00]  What do you, yeah, what do you look like?  I'm about 125, 5'6", and long black hair.  Of course, it's fake.  Procic.  What do you got to weave in?  Yeah, you could say it's glued on, baby.  Glued on.  What does your natural hair look like?  My natural hair?  Yeah.  You don't want to know.  Like Oscar Gamble?  Why aren't you proud of your natural hair?  Shut it up, okay?  We live in America.  Oh, wow.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:43:30]  You should be proud of your nappy hair, my sister.  Rise up, my sister, and be proud.  I am proud.  Yeah, but you cover up your hair with that weave.  Because I look better that way.  Don't you know you were just trying to look better for the white devil?  I've been watching the cable access, the Brooklyn thing.  Yeah, and those guys are on there all the time preaching about it.  I was a star in it, do you see me?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right, Ann, do you want Laundrie to play What's in My Pants?  Absolutely.  All right, Laundrie, are you ready to play What's in My Pants? 
[01:44:00]  Yes, I am.  All right.  You're going to pull down your pants and do what we say, right?  Yeah, they're kind of laughing at me.  That's all right.  Hold on, we've got to get the theme song on the radio.  Okay.  Oh, this ain't a good one, though.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  Help me.  Somebody help me. 
[01:44:30]  Help me.  Help me.  The Lord alone, he's desperate.  Do what he say.  Do what he say.  The African version of Guess What's in My Pants with the lovely Laundrie.  Hopi, we are going to have to change some of the selections.  Yeah, what are the regular selections for What's in My Pants?  Okay, we have the triangle.  We have the mohawk.  We have the Hitler mustache.  Yes. 
[01:45:00]  And we have the wood floor.  Wood floor, sure.  So now we're going to change these.  The triangle is now going to be the Don King.  The Don King?  Yes.  The big Don King.  Okay.  I was thinking more like Oscar Gamble.  Oh, yeah?  You know when Oscar Gamble would put his Yankee hat on and the hair would fly out the sides?  Okay, this is open for discussion.  We could have the Oscar Gamble.  I think we all had that baseball card when we were young.  The Oscar Gamble.  He would try to get that Yankee helmet on. 
[01:45:30]  The Afro would be flying up the sides of the helmet.  I'm thinking if a girl's really, you know, hairy, that could be flying out the sides of her, you know.  Okay.  So let's go with the Oscar Gamble.  Oscar Gamble.  I hate to, you know.  This is for the triangle.  Okay.  All right.  Don King is out.  All right.  Now we need for the mohawk.  The mohawk.  Now it could, Mr. T could be the mohawk.  Yeah, I think that.  I would think that's close enough.  Mr. T is the mohawk.  All right.  I got one for the wood floor in. 
[01:46:00]  Okay.  I don't know.  Do you have a suggestion?  Well, there are a few.  There's the Michael Jordan.  Okay.  Or the shaft.  All right.  I'm just thinking to stay on the same line as like the wood floor.  So I'm thinking like a blacktop.  Blacktop.  Very good.  Blacktop.  Blacktop.  Blacktop.  Very smooth.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Now we just need something for Hitler mustache.  We could do Billy Dee Williams mustache.  Ah, the pencil.  He's got that little pencil thing going. 
[01:46:30]  That's good.  Quite a Hitler mustache, but that could work.  Someone suggested the Clyde Frazier, Anthony.  The Clyde Frazier?  That's pretty good.  He had some wacky styles going on in the 70s.  Okay.  No, whatever you want to do for the Hitler mustache.  No one really has a good Hitler mustache.  The Montel Williams mustache?  Montel Williams.  Kind of like a little Hitler mustache.  It's kind of that marine mustache thing he's got going.  We're just not hitting it, man. 
[01:47:00]  No.  Someone's got it out there.  We can't play until we get the Hitler mustache equivalent.  Well, do we have the rest?  The basic triangle is now the Oscar gamble.  Talking very hairy.  The mohawk is the Mr. T.  Okay.  And for wood floor, it is black top.  But we cannot find the equivalent of the Hitler mustache.  Where it's just that tiny little strip.  Yeah.  I hate when we're stumped. 
[01:47:30]  That's a tough one.  Because there's not really anybody that has that style.  Oh, the Little Richard.  Yeah, the Little Richard.  That's good.  All right.  We can play.  Who's that?  Pete from Queens.  Thank you.  Pete.  Pete from Queens.  We are taking the Little Richard.  Little Richard.  The Hitler mustache.  Yeah, that's not bad at all.  All right.  Laundra.  Woo!  Yeah.  It is the most...  No, I can't believe it.  Woo! 
[01:48:00]  There you go.  Another example of why this is the most interactive radio show in America.  Yeah, look at that.  Pete just helped us out from Queens.  Thank you, Pete.  Listeners always helping us.  All right, Laundra.  Yeah?  It is time, finally, to play What's in My Pants.  The Shirley Hample.  No, I have a good one.  What?  No, you don't tell us.  Don't tell us what you have.  No, I'm not telling you what I have.  Okay.  Well, let's get the pants off or down.  Yeah, get that phone ready.  All right.  All right.  You're unzipping those pants? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  You got to let us know what's going on because this is radio.  All right.  All right.  I'm opening a button and I'm sipping down my pants now.  What kind of panties you got on?  Bikini.  Bikini.  Woo!  A bikini.  Lovely.  Woo!  Yeah, K-Mart special.  K-Mart special.  The blue light special?  Yeah, you can see.  Yeah.  All right.  Are you down to your panties?  Yeah.  I'm ready. 
[01:49:00]  You guys ready?  You ready to play?  Yeah.  Where are the panties?  The Aunt Bunny mustache.  What?  You want me to rub it on my panties?  I don't want to kiss Aunt Bunny.  No.  Goonie Google.  No, we're just making sure the panties are off.  They're down.  All right.  They're down.  That's fine.  All right.  Yeah, you're ready.  All right.  Why don't you talk her through this now?  All right, Alondra, the way we play, you will rub the phone on your most intimate of areas  as per our instructions.  Then we will guess what you have in your pants, the Oscar Gamble, the Mr. T, the Little Richard, 
[01:49:30]  or the Blacktop.  Okay.  And once all of us have decided and we ask you, you will then reveal what you indeed  do have in your pants.  In the first ever African princess, guess what's in my pants?  Yes.  Okay, Alondra, if you would, please rub in an up and down motion on your most intimates.  All right. 
[01:50:00]  You guys got it?  All right.  Now, side to side.  Okay.  Hmm.  Well, I might need that again.  Yeah.  I need the side to side a couple more times.  All right.  One more time.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Interesting.  Okay.  Now, Alondra, if you would, in a circular motion.  Very slow.  Okay. 
[01:50:30]  Hmm.  Oh, no.  What are you thinking, O?  What are you thinking?  That just tricked me.  Yeah.  Woo, this is tough.  That tricked me, that last one.  This is tough.  Okay.  Hmm.  Ah.  All right.  Who wants to go first?  I'll go first.  Opie, we'll go first.  Remember, Alondra, don't reveal this until we are all done and we ask you.  All right.  You heard the sounds, Opie.  Would you like anything repeated, maybe?  I'm, yeah.  I need the side to side again.  I'll give you the side to side. 
[01:51:00]  Laundra, if you would please, the side to side.  Okay.  The circular motion got me all left up.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Hmm.  Okay, I got it.  All right.  Open.  Anthony, I'm going to go with, don't say what it is, Laundra, until we're done.  All right.  I'm going to go with the Oscar gamble.  He's going with the Oscar gamble.  Okay.  All right.  I guess I'm up, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  That side to side is very tricky. 
[01:51:30]  I'm torn.  I'm very torn here.  But I am going to go with the Mr. T.  Going with the Mr. T.  Which would be the Mohawk.  Yes, yes.  Okay.  And let's get Rick in on the game.  I think I'm going to go with Little Richard.  Wow.  We have a split decision here.  I thought I heard a second.  Interesting.  No one thinking the black top, which it very well could be also, because I was kind of  drifting that way a little bit. 
[01:52:00]  But all right.  Opie is saying Oscar gamble.  I am saying the Mr. T.  And Rick is saying the Little Richard.  Laundra, if you would please tell us, what is in your pants?  Okay.  Well, I would call it a Velcro patch.  Straight down the middle.  Straight down the middle?  Yeah.  Would that be the equivalent of a Mohawk or a Mr. T?  Mr. T.  Yes.  A Mr. T.  I was, the side to side, I was hearing some inconsistency.  The Velcro patch.  That's what it was.  The Velcro patch. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, I was hearing, like, a little bit of a different sound that it would skate over  when it hit the Velcro patches.  That's how they put it.  But she has a Mr. T.  Great.  That's wonderful.  In the first ever African princess, guess what's in my pants?  Laundra.  Thank you so much.  All right.  I love you, guys.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Come on, help me. 
[01:53:00]  I got it from a Negro.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  No, no, no.  He's desperate to what he's saying.  What he's saying.  Yeah.  Kusa.  Kusa.  Hey, Laundra.  Yeah?  We want to give you something for playing today, okay?  Okay, thanks.  I don't know what the white man has to offer you, but hold on the line, okay?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Laundra, the lovely Laundra, the first African princess to help us out with our guess what's 
[01:53:30]  in your pants game.  What?  That was exciting.  That was awesome.  I like it.  Someone is suggesting the next time we play, we should name the Hitler mustache the Ethiopian.  That's bad.  I pity the poor fool.  Try to get in his vagina.  The Mr. T.  Congratulations, Ant.  Thanks.  I was very torn.  I thought also it was going to be what you said.  Yeah.  The Oscar gamble.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony? 
[01:54:00]  I would love to play the same game with a bunch of Asian ladies.  That could be fun.  The Moe, the Moe, the Moe Howard, the Moe Howard, and the Pete Rose.  Let's do the Charlie Chan.  The Charlie Chan.  That could be fun.  We'll do the Asian version one of these days, okay?  A haul.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk. 
[01:54:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  And cut.  Anthony Bud Light.  Ah, Bud Light.  I think he's going to need a Bud Light.  Calm him down a little bit.  Take the edge off.  We love Bud Light.  Drink it all the time.  It's New York's cold, easy-to-drink beer, isn't it?  Bud Light's not watered down like other beers.  We're proud Bud Light drinkers, as are our listeners.  No lime needed with Bud Light?  Have one today.  Bud Light's the life of the party, isn't it, Opie?  Hmm?  Making a Bud Light all summer long. 
[01:55:00]  Drink it when you're watching the Yankees, the Matts.  What more do you want me to say?  Bud Light.  Drink it.  I'll be slamming back a bunch of Bud Lights when I find out if Ewing was definitely traded or not.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  He's gone.  Don't worry.  I'm stressing, man.  I'm stressing.  Who cares?  Because he is gone.  He will not be a Nick next year.  Anthony, anyway, why don't you finish up the Bud Light thing?  Make it a Bud Light all summer.  Drink Bud Light.  Have one today.  We're looking for a few good enemas. 
[01:55:30]  What the hell are you talking about?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1027 WNEW.  Yes.  Oh, dear.  Smack my bitch up.  Send this out to Sean Connery.  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to smack my bitch up.  I guess they don't want him knighted. 
[01:56:00]  They want to strip him of his knighthood.  Yeah, I guess it's a big story in, what, the post today?  Yeah, even after he's, uh, let's see, yeah, he's supposed to be knighted by the queen, but  they want to strip him of it because, uh, well, for years, it seems he's just been smacking  his bitches up.  Oh.  Come on.  What's wrong with that? 
[01:56:30]  Come here.  Come here, you lovely little thing.  Come here.  Come here, give us a kiss.  You stupid bitch.  God, Sean Connery is, uh...  Well, it's quite an honor to be knighted, and they feel like they shouldn't, uh, give  it to someone that beats his women.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, there was controversy with him, uh, back in, I guess, the early 90s.  He was, uh, on an interview with Barbara Walters and said, uh, he could imagine hitting his 
[01:57:00]  wife two years after he said that he tried to justify the statement in Vanity Fair.  Well, let's be honest.  I think we could all imagine hitting our woman.  Oh, my God.  There are times you really do want to do it, but there's something that tells you in the  back of your head that it's not a good thing to do.  Well, he tried to explain it by saying, uh...  Sometimes you do get pissed, and you imagine a lot of, uh, a lot of things, Anthony.  He says to Barbara Walters, uh, about the Barbara Walters interview in Vanity Fair, I was really  saying that to slap a woman is not the cruelest thing you can do to her. 
[01:57:30]  It's much more cruel to psychologically damage someone.  I'm not right, you slut.  I'm gonna take a crowbar and smash you in the face with it.  I told her to shit.  What, what?  In the chair.  Oh, oh, oh, sit.  Sit down.  You say sit, very, uh, unusual.  I have this speech impediment with my S's.  I see.  Come here. 
[01:58:00]  You're lovely.  Now sit.  Sit down.  The fire smacks you.  Bloody bitch.  Yeah, yeah.  This is a great little, little, uh, I guess story on what happened years ago.  Uh, his wife at the time, the sultry Diana Salento, uh, became friendly with a hotel waiter.  The actor ordered her to go to the hotel suite. 
[01:58:30]  Go back to the suite and sit there and wait for me.  You're saying sit, right?  Sit.  That's what I said.  Sit.  Sit in the chair.  Yeah.  Diana Salento.  She became friendly with a hotel waiter.  So I said, go back to the hotel and sit and wait for me.  Uh, she went there.  Uh, the actor returned to the suite and allegedly, uh, allegedly, allegedly delivered a brutal beating.  Connery hit her, not with the flat of his hands, but with fists full between the eyes. 
[01:59:00]  Jesus.  Another blow follows the first and then another and another until Salento falls back onto the bed.  Her face, a bloody mess.  The next morning, the face of one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation was ballooned up like a puffer fish.  He beat the crap out of her.  What a douche.  Take that.  Talk to a waiter.  I'll get back to the suite and sit there and wait for me. 
[01:59:30]  You just don't know.  I'm losing my hair and it pisses me off.  That's what it is.  Going bald.  Hair's falling in my face, you bitch.  You're false.  God damn.  Boy, that sounds pretty brutal.  You know, in the face like that.  My women, I like to actually hit them with, uh, phone books about the body so they can't tell. 
[02:00:00]  Uh, I had a good idea.  Remember Ike Turner?  Yeah.  From Ike and Tina Turner?  Yeah.  She would beat her with a car antenna on her body so she could perform later that night and not be all boozed up.  See, Sean Connery doesn't know the final odds of beating your woman.  You've got to punch her internal organs like the universe, imagine me.  But I like the hotel room thing. 
[02:00:30]  That's good.  I and Mike likes the hotels.  Because then he don't have to clean the blood up off his own floor, off his own house.  Well, what does Sean Connery think of, uh, Mike Tyson's advice there?  Oh, Mike, just go shit in a corner.  Sit, right?  That's what I say.  Why you keep questioning me?  I just want to make sure.  Of course I'm saying shit.  Sit down.  I don't want them dumping out of the show if you're, if you're really saying sit.  Sit down.  Yeah.  Sit.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  Like in a chair.  It's that speech impediment, right?  That's what it is.  Something with my, uh, S's. 
[02:01:00]  I have a hard time saying shit.  I like that O.J. Simpson.  A good man.  What's wrong with that?  Sometimes you, you just imagine that.  You have to shit and concentrate.  Sit down in a chair and concentrate.  Sometimes I just like to sit down on the toilet.  Wow.  Yeah, so I guess they're going to try to take his knighthood away. 
[02:01:30]  I don't think it means the same thing these days, people.  What's the big deal?  Didn't Paul McCartney get knighted?  See him on armor on top of a horse jousting or anything?  Maybe it meant something in the old days.  Anthony Hopkins, right?  Yeah.  He's a knight now.  Sir Anthony Hopkins knighted.  Yeah, now, could you send them all into battle?  Like the old days with big maces and swords.  Could you see that?  Get over here.  No.  Chopped my hair off.  It's only a flesh wound.  That's great.  The queen will give me a sword. 
[02:02:00]  And I'll beat my wife over the head with it.  Bitch.  Sit here.  Sit.  Paul McCartney going into battle.  Swinging a big battle axe.  Please.  What does the knighthood mean anymore?  Swinging the spike ball.  You know what the old knights used to do?  Lock up that snatch.  Remember that?  That's not abusive.  They used to put those chastity belts on them when they went into battle. 
[02:02:30]  So the farm workers and stuff couldn't come by and bang them.  Well, then maybe Sean Connery should be knighted.  It's chivalry.  Shut up.  Get back to the suite.  Get back to the suite, you bitch.  And sit there and wait for me.  I hit you with my knight's sword.  And a big mace.  And that big hammer.  From Braveheart.  Remember that big hammer they came to guys' head in?  I smacked my bitch up with that one. 
[02:03:00]  Shut up.  Go with your waiter, friend, you whore.  Wait for me there, all bloody, and then I'll slam my yam bag against your ass.  I'll be at laugh your balls off in the picture.  Sitting on stage.  In a stool.  Sitting.  That's what I said.  Why do you keep correcting me?  I just want to make sure.  Well, thank you, Sean Connery, for stopping by today.  Elton John's a knight.  Jesus Christ.  He's going to go into battle with a dildo.  A big dildo.  He should be a dame. 
[02:03:30]  I'm going to beat that bitch Elton John.  Come here, Elton.  Yes, you scream like a bitch.  Talking to that waiter.  Get back to the sweet shit and wait for me.  I'll stick a gold finger in there.  A whole gold fist.  Money penny.  Money penny, get over here.  Shit there and let me smack you.  I like my martinis like I like my women.  Shaking. 
[02:04:00]  And then punch.  Shaking, not stirring.  Q, what kind of inventions do you have for me today?  Something I can remotely beat my wife from miles away?  Just with the push of a button?  Or an ejector seat?  So she can sit there and I can eject her right out of the car?  Q, suck it.  Wait, give me a pad.  Wait, we still have Sean in here.  Give me a pad.  Give me a pad.  Yes, yes. 
[02:04:30]  Quick, go.  Write faster, Opie.  Sorry.  I'm reading here.  Money penny.  Look what I did to you again.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  It just sounds funny. 
[02:05:00]  Dopey and Anthony show.  I think that might be part of the problem with society today.  Oh, I believe we're the problem.  Geltic, you stupid bitch.  1027 WNEW.  I was watching the MTV Movie Awards.  That blew it off.  Which saw, ha ha ha, so bad.  So friggin' bad.  They had that Sarah Jessica Parker hosting.  She was horrible. 
[02:05:30]  Ruth Buzzy in a dress.  Her face is looking like Ruth Buzzy.  And she's like parading around.  She kept doing costume changes every like five minutes, you know.  She come out in a new dress.  And she's showing off like she's all hot and everything.  But, you know, you should keep those clothes on.  Exactly.  In L.A. Story and a few years after that.  Her boobage were getting like all flat.  And like, it just wasn't working for me.  The last few years have not been kind to Sarah Jessica Parker.  Not working for me.  And then everybody that was there. 
[02:06:00]  Like all the big celebrities that show up for the MTV Movie Awards.  They're just there to hawk their movies.  That's all.  They had Samuel Jackson talking about Shaft.  He's wearing a Shaft hat.  He's up there Shaft this, Shaft that.  M.R.F.  They had to bleep every other word he said.  And then they had a, what's his face there?  It's in the Patriot.  Oh, Mel?  Mel Gibson.  Yeah.  Mel Gibson.  I'm on first name basis with him.  Mel.  Yeah.  Mel.  Mel.  Mel.  Mel-y Mel.  They had him because he's got a movie coming out. 
[02:06:30]  It's all a bunch of crap.  Anybody that didn't have a movie coming out wasn't going to do the movie award.  And it was obvious.  They were just there to hawk their movies.  There were no highlights at all?  Nothing.  It was boring as hell.  Boring.  Adam Sandler came out and read a little acceptance thing like that was written from the kid from  Big Daddy.  Uh-huh.  And that was mildly amusing until it really started going too long.  He always goes too long.  And that was it.  In those award shows.  That was it.  Like that was the highlight if you can even call it that. 
[02:07:00]  Who do we have on the line?  Hey, you want to talk about the MTV Video Awards?  Dude, this thing sucked.  It sucked.  It was so bad.  I know.  I mean, I thought the South Park skit would save it.  It sucked too.  Yeah.  It was kind of funny when the gladiator killed Kenny.  And they're like, wait a minute.  Timmy.  Yeah.  And then Timmy was in there.  Timmy.  Oh, really?  They really tried to play that Sarah Jessica Parker thing off like it was going to be  funny.  But she was so bad.  And she can't talk like naturally. 
[02:07:30]  It was obvious that she's reading from cue cards.  And all the MTV thing was supposed to be like the hip alternative to award shows.  And they all act like they're like it's the Oscars or something.  They're reading off the teleprompters.  They can't carry on a conversation with each other.  It was ridiculous.  The first few years of the MTV Movie Awards were pretty good.  It was cool.  You didn't know it was going to happen.  Now it's structured and it's like every other award show.  It sucks.  They think it's like, oh, we're hip.  Look, the presenters come down on a slide from the back of the thing. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  That's cool.  That's different than the Oscars.  And then they step up to the podium and start giving the same long-winded dopey ass speeches.  It used to be the anti-award show.  Now it's just another award show.  It's too bad.  It sucks.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks, bro.  All right, cool.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Hey.  Hey.  Who's this?  You're not Sarah Jessica Parker. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, these are the fellas that were just trashing me.  Are these the guys?  Are you Sarah Jessica Parker?  I am indeed.  Now how do you prove that?  How do I prove it?  I don't know.  How does one prove their identity with the phone?  It does sound a lot like you.  I got to say that.  Do you listen to our radio show?  No, I don't.  As a matter of fact, my trailer driver had it on and I was fortunate.  The timing was absolutely beautifully fortuitous for me.  Sarah Jessica, I got to say your performance on the MTV Movie Awards, fantastic. 
[02:09:00]  I thought you did a great job.  I loved the costume changes, especially the one at the end.  You're such a puss, Ant.  What?  It's Sarah Jessica Parker.  You don't have the balls to actually say to me what you said to your maybe limited audience?  Come on, buddy.  Limited audience?  Come on.  We get more people listening to this show than watching that Sex and the City.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you certain of that?  Positive.  I watched the...  Hey, guys, listen, listen.  I watched the...  Take it easy.  It's all right.  You're absolutely entitled to an opinion. 
[02:09:30]  I just thought it'd be...  I just thought maybe I'd put a human face to, you know, some trash talk.  I thought it'd be helpful to you to actually make it less abstract and more of a person.  I thought you were really hot in L.A.'s story.  Hello?  That means the world to me.  Thank you.  Thanks.  So what do you guys do?  You're DJs on the air in New York City?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your chat show host?  Yeah, that's all we do.  We're not as famous as you or anything.  No.  You know.  But listen, what I wanted to do, what I actually wanted to do, because I actually don't know 
[02:10:00]  you guys and I don't actually listen to the radio only because I don't have time,  not because I'm an elitist or I think I'm above it.  Why don't you come to...  I simply don't listen to the radio that much.  Yeah.  What I thought I might do, since you've hurt my feelings so terribly, and since I actually am  a person with feelings, and you seem to have an idea about me that I'm sort of hideous  and awful...  What?  What did I learn about?  Hold on.  Hold on.  What else I do?  Let me finish, fellas.  What does she want to do?  Let me have mine.  What do you want?  Perhaps what I do is I would invite you to the set if you're interested in comedy.  We're shooting in New York City, as you know, with our tiny little audience show 
[02:10:30]  called Sex in the City, which is just bigger than ever.  I saw the season premiere, and I enjoyed the whole Staten Island thing you guys did this  past week.  Thank you.  Well, thanks.  That's big of you.  Thank you.  What I thought I'd do is, if you guys are brave enough, I thought perhaps you might want  to come to the set and pay a visit and actually see that I'm not a deformed, awful-looking  person.  Oh, my...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  And he said it actually...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  He forced me to toot my own horn, and I will say this. 
[02:11:00]  We didn't take it that far.  I have never been one that had been accused of being stilted in her speaking.  I have made numerous appearances on Letterman for God knows how many years.  Sarah, you seemed a little stiff.  Sarah...  I'd hardly be accused of being a stiff person.  Wait, we're just too...  Let me just...  Let me finish.  We're just two schmucks on the radio.  Let her finish.  What does it matter what we say?  Let her finish.  I think it's a rather daunting experience.  We have a personal taste.  That's all.  I think it's a rather daunting experience to be the host of an award show when one has  not made a living nor a practice of doing that. 
[02:11:30]  And I think that perhaps if you met me, you might actually discover that you like me.  You might actually be on my side.  You want to come down today?  We're...  No, no, no.  We have some listeners.  I work 18 hours a day.  I think you have to come here.  I think that's the best you can do with men is to tod your little seat down to my set.  Come visit me and say hello.  Oh, look.  Now she made me feel all bad.  I know.  You should.  You should.  You guys take pot shots and you don't realize we're people.  Man, we've got...  You're asked to do something.  Would you turn...  Would you say no to the FB award?  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me... 
[02:12:00]  Whether or not you knew you had to do something.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  We didn't say you were hideous or anything.  Yes, you did.  Not really.  We just said...  Yes, you absolutely, without question, inferred that calling me Ruth Buzzy, calling me old.  I thought it was quite flattering when I said you're starting to look like Ruth Buzzy.  You damn people aren't supposed to listen to these goddamn jokes.  You really think whoever you are, whichever one you are, you really think that calling  somebody Ruth Buzzy is a flattering comment?  You need to get out more often, my friend.  It's called humor.  We're just trying to have fun.  You think people that heard that comment really go, oh, yeah, she's looking like Ruth Buzzy? 
[02:12:30]  We're heinous.  Wait.  We're heinous.  We're heinous.  I imagine you are, and so you're still lashing out with rage.  That's what it is.  With rage you are.  Come on, boys.  Come on, we're on the set one day.  We're two just, you know, radio talk show hosts.  You shouldn't...  Don't be scared of me.  You shouldn't...  Don't be scared of me.  I'm not scared.  You're going to have Matthew punch us in the nose?  Listen, Matthew is so above punching you two in the nose.  Wow, we got to you.  Who are we?  You're like a big, famous Hollywood star. 
[02:13:00]  You're just two local shock jocks.  You actually are real people with feelings, and they work really hard.  And granted, am I a flawless person?  But no.  Do I go and fix it and become something else?  I'm not.  That's who I am.  And because I'm fond of it, you know.  Can we play What's in Sarah Jessica Parker's Pants right now?  It's a game we play.  I think it would be a good way to break the ice and make peace.  You take the phone and rub it on your most intimate of areas, and we guess how you're groomed.  Let me ask you a question.  Yes.  Let me ask you a question.  I can't believe we got to.  I'm thinking. 
[02:13:30]  I'm thinking.  You're delighted to know.  You just made my day.  Aren't you guys just kind of delighted to know that when you actually trash someone,  that there's actually a person listening, and they have to be like...  No, I hate that.  I hate that.  Yeah, we're going to have to reevaluate the entire program now.  It kind of makes you feel like crap, doesn't it?  Honestly, no, it doesn't.  It's just so easy to do.  No, Sarah, Sarah, if you'll let us talk, it doesn't change my opinion at all.  I don't care.  We're just trying to have fun and make people laugh.  We're just two local shock jocks.  You're a Hollywood star, and we got to.  I'm not a Hollywood star.  I'm a New Yorker. 
[02:14:00]  I've lived here my whole life.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm a working actress.  That's what I am.  You're not...  I dig.  I dig that you put me on the air.  Yeah.  I dig that you put me on the air, and I'm not...  I'm not saying you're not entitled.  It's the first thing I said.  I just want you to know there's a person.  Are you going to...  There's a person attached.  Are you going to cry?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm a grown woman.  She won't cry.  Maybe secretly we think you're really hot, and we're frustrated that we can't get you.  You guys want to come visit me?  Or no?  And we can't have sex with you or something.  We'll come visit you as long...  I'm sorry.  Don't go overboard.  You guys want to come visit?  I'll come visit you as long as you don't get us beat up or anything. 
[02:14:30]  No, I just want you to meet the crew, and I want you to meet everybody that I work with.  Oh, that's going to just be ugly.  And we'll get all beat up and everything.  Why not come and be in my environment?  How about we meet in the middle somewhere?  Neutral territory?  Yes.  Like Sweden?  Man, I'm starting to like you all of a sudden.  Like Sweden?  She's feisty.  You're feisty.  I like that.  Well, unattractive women tend to be feisty.  No, Ruth Fuzzy never gave me a boner.  You do.  Okay?  Please, fellas, don't try to backpedal that much. 
[02:15:00]  No, we're not backpedaling.  You're getting on the good side.  I wanted you to know that there's actually a human being connected when you guys...  I know it's funny, and I know it's charming, and it's amusing to the listeners, and I've  laughed at things in the past, too.  But I just want you to know there's a person.  That's all.  Opie's the mean one.  I'm nice.  I don't know which one's which, and I sort of don't care because you guys sort of did  a tag team thing.  No, you care because you called in.  I do care.  I do care what you said.  So you just heard our voices in the background in between, you know, filming Sex and the  City, and went, oh, my God, they're talking about me? 
[02:15:30]  Where were you when you heard us trashing you?  We're sitting downtown on Chamber Street.  Right.  In the surrogate court building, which means I'm surrounded by authority.  Right.  So anyway, I have to go to set.  They're calling me at set.  But I just wanted to...  Can we have all our listeners bring down flowers to apologize or something?  I want you to bring down flowers.  They didn't do anything wrong.  They're just happy listeners.  Trust me.  I think...  Right?  Huh?  No, they're on our side.  They all feel the same way.  You feel good.  No, no, no, no.  Someone on line nine is calling us pussies. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You can't win.  Because now we're back.  Listen, thank you.  Thank you for letting me call.  You're men for listening.  I appreciate it.  And I'm dead serious when I say come down to the set and visit.  You don't have to come today.  We're shooting until mid-August.  We're here in New York City.  Could you hold on?  Our producer will just get info.  If you could just give it to somebody on that end, we'll try to figure something out.  I look forward to meeting you.  And I secretly do watch Sex and the City, even though I can't admit it on the radio show.  It's kind of a chick show.  No, it's not, man.  And you are the hottest on the show.  The blonde I don't like at all. 
[02:16:30]  She was naked in the firehouse this week.  These are the people I work with.  I dig her.  I dig her.  Yeah, but I...  She's a trash talk to me.  I'm not going to jump on your side.  No, but I'm just giving my opinions again.  All right, but don't be kidding me.  She was naked through that whole first episode, and I wasn't feeling it.  I was hoping you were going to get naked with that politician, the controller.  I'll never get naked.  I never have, and I never will.  No?  It was pretty close last night on the movie awards.  All right, why don't you produce the information so I can go to set and not get fired?  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes.  Sarah Jessica Parker. 
[02:17:00]  She's calling in.  Well, you know, she's got some balls there.  Comes calling up and defending herself.  Man, this show has come a long way.  You know, it used to be safe where we could trash people, and it never gets back to them.  Yeah.  I think our audience is getting too big, Anthony.  Yeah, we got to leave this city.  If we were in Tallahassee, you know, no one would care.  They go line to Sarah Jessica Parker.  I'm like, there's no way it's Sarah Jessica Parker.  It's Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yelling at us.  Opie. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  You should be a little nicer next time.  The scary thing.  I bet you we go down there, and we see her, and we just go, oh, my God, she's knockout gorgeous.  She's so hot.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh.  She just made us eat crow, practically.  Screw the rat.  Yeah, I know.  It's so hard to just, because everyone can call up and say, you guys are pussies, why don't you, you know, it's one thing to say stuff on the air.  It's another when they call up and call you on it to, like, keep going. 
[02:18:00]  I think we held our own, though.  I didn't back down too much.  No, I totally pussied out.  I got to be honest with you.  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  I totally pussied out.  I do like it when her hair is down.  When she pulls it back, it's not as sexy, Anthony.  Yeah.  But we love Sex and the City, right, Ant?  It's one of my favorite shows.  I can't believe she heard us trashing her.  Hey, are there any other celebrities listening today? 
[02:18:30]  We'd love to hear from you, and we'll give you our opinion on you.  Yeah, and then you could rub it in our face.  Right.  God, we're just two dopey, like, local talk show guys, and we got to, like, a Hollywood starlet.  With our stupid opinions, Anthony.  Made it feel bad.  Yeah, see?  And I'll go on record to say, Ant and I are nothing to look at.  We know that.  We never sit here on the radio and say, hey, you know, GQ called, and they want us for a photo shoot.  But I'll tell you one thing.  If MTV Movie Awards called and wanted me to host, I wouldn't be strutting around in clothes trying to look all hot. 
[02:19:00]  You know.  You just didn't like the MTV Movie Awards, and she was what, the host?  She was the host, yeah.  And I think, and I still said, she came across as a little stiff, I'll be.  Okay.  A little stiff.  Any other celebrities like to call up today?  We'd love to talk to you.  In her defense, she said that she doesn't do that by trade.  And she thought it would be an exciting, fun thing to do, like in hosting the MTV Movie Awards. 
[02:19:30]  So she did it.  And who am I to say that she came off as stiff?  I think all next week we dedicate the O&A show to Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yes.  It'll be the We Love You Sarah Jessica all week next week.  Okay.  We could do that.  We'll get a Sky Rider.  We'll put a heart up over Central Park.  We'll get our listeners to send flowers down to the store.  Let's make up some bumpers saying that this week is the Sarah Jessica Parker Love Fest week.  Love Fest week.  Oh, boy. 
[02:20:00]  I didn't feel bad, though.  If she's listening, I didn't.  We're just trying to have fun and have some, make people laugh.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I heard her voice.  I knew that was her right away.  I felt guilty, man, for laughing at what you guys were saying.  I was like, holy mackerel.  I know.  It's very rare someone calls us out on something, and I'm like, there's no way that Sarah Jessica Parker will take time out of her busy day.  She just hosted the movie awards, even though they taped that a while ago. 
[02:20:30]  But I'm sure she's doing press, post-press.  She's filming Sex and the City.  And I'm like, there's no way she has time to call up because two wacky DJs in New York said something bad about her.  It's like telling your buddies you're with this chick, and all of a sudden she walks in a room.  We just got snagged is what happened.  We got snagged.  We were called out, and then I, for one, folded.  I folded.  Oh, I hate that.  They're not supposed to be real people.  They're just cagged. 
[02:21:00]  Whatever.  Repeat.  Yeah, you guys are such pussies.  Tripping over your own tampon strings as you're backpedaling, you two little women.  Hey, I got a good idea.  The next Sex and the City, maybe they can have all the girls bend you guys over and just rape the hell out of you women.  We'll be violated with strap-on devices on Sex and the City.  Sex and the City has become one of our favorite shows right behind Survivor. 
[02:21:30]  What a mess.  They're not supposed to call.  I'm like, there's no way a lady's going to, like, imitate Sarah Jessica Parker well.  I could tell by the voice.  Wait, wait, wait.  Rick just had a...  Did you talk to her or she put you on with someone else?  First, I got an earful from her.  What'd she say to you on the phone after we hung up with her?  She asked if I was proud to be working for you guys.  Oh, you gotta see.  And I had to admit that, no, I wasn't.  Not at that particular moment.  Oh, you're a pussy, too.  Look at you.  Hey, I learned from you guys.  Oh, we got off on the wrong foot with Sarah Jessica Parker. 
[02:22:00]  Now we're going to have to make it up to her.  I'll be honest.  I don't have the balls to go down to the set of Sex and the City and meet her and confront her.  Oh, have a bunch of hot chicks laughing at us.  Yeah, that's not emasculating at all.  Because we never claimed to be freaking, you know, models or anything.  Oh, no.  And you know Matthew's going to be there.  He's going to try to punch us in the nose because we trashed his woman.  Dude, can we get a couple of, like, GQ model guys to go down there as Opie and Anthony? 
[02:22:30]  Come on.  Come on.  That's perfect.  We'll pay him.  They'll be dressed to the nines and stuff.  Right.  Welcome.  Hello.  I'm Opie.  I'm Anthony.  How are you?  Sorry, Jessica.  We got to take a break, Anthony.  Okay.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Stupid.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people. 
[02:23:00]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  W-N-E-W.  Where is my car?  I can't seem to find my automobile.  They seem to have taken it from me.  Hello.  Yeah, we're here.  Hello.  I am Arthur.  Yeah, we figured that much out.  I race cars, play tennis, and fonder women.  But I have weekends off, and I am my own boss.  Hey, where the hell's my car? 
[02:23:30]  Don't you hate me as you, Annie?  Well, a lot of people do.  I can't believe they took my car.  I should have let Bitterman drive.  Help!  Whoa, Arthur.  What happened?  Hello.  Yeah, what happened?  Well, with my car, I was on my way to Long Island to see Susan.  Yeah.  You know, in the right light, she's quite beautiful. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  But you can't always depend on that light.  Ha-ha-ha.  You know, Susan said a real woman could keep me from drinking.  It would have to be a real big woman.  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Keep falling down.  You all right?  Hi, Linda!  No.  Don't you hope Harry's wife?  Yeah, we all do.  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Hobson...  Hobson is very angry with me.  Yeah?  When the officers stopped me, I fell out of the car! 
[02:24:30]  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Is that the funniest thing you've ever heard of?  Ha-ha-ha!  I fell out of the car!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Bitterman, do you want to double your salary?  Well, then, open that door!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  I think now I should be going to the hospital.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  All right, then.  And where the hell's my car?  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha 
[02:25:00]  What should I have them take next? 
[02:25:30]  Maybe the rose.  Maybe, yeah.  I'm going to look.  Oh, there's my car.  There he is.  Oh, you're a hedge.  I think now I should be going.  Hobson's taking the knife out of the cheese.  You think he wants a piece of cheese?  Arthur.  All right, there he goes, everyone, Arthur. 
[02:26:00]  Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Lois, what's going on?  What about those kids having oral sex in the bathroom or something like that?  Yeah, we can talk about that.  It's in the Post today.  How about that?  Yeah, there's an article by Andrea, I don't know, Pizer, Pizer, Pizer, whatever.  It says, kindergarten sex games, one mom's nightmare.  Yeah.  Now, Ann was talking earlier about dry humping in elementary school. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, like sixth grade, though.  You know, you start rocking around that age.  Some of the kids, you know.  I'm a late woman, man.  Even in kindergarten, there was a little bit of action going on, but it was just showing.  I remember walking to a girl's house and showing behind.  Showing hiney.  Showing hiney.  I did the show me your hiney.  I'd go to the house.  And the mother would come to the door.  And I don't even remember, you know.  Oh, can you and Mary come out and play? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, okay.  Went around back by the porch and kind of went, you know, in the corner.  And she'd pull her pants down, and I'd look at her ass, and she would want me to do the same.  She'd do that.  You know, that was like, hey, thanks.  Thank you, honey.  That was sex.  That was sex.  That was pretty much it.  Oh, got to go for a six-year-old, right?  Got to go.  All right.  So, this article, kindergarten sex games, one mom's nightmare.  I can't believe this is going on in the public schools, Anthony.  I can.  I can.  Seriously?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:27:30]  Get out of here.  Dude, let's just say, because I don't want to get into anything.  Uh, that's, uh, I don't want to make this discussion change gears, but there's a certain segment of society.  Oh, no.  Where this is happening.  Oh, no.  Let me just say that.  It is.  Sound the alarm.  There's a, I'm not going to say what segment.  Oh, no.  I'm staying out of things.  Wada doodle.  I'm staying out of trouble today.  I believe it's the Irish.  It is.  Yeah.  The kindergarten Irish are getting drunk.  No. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, my God.  I know.  It's queued up.  I might have to go to that.  Oh, no, no, no.  Yes.  You bastard.  All right.  Listen.  All right.  So, the article starts, uh, as she sent her five-year-old son to kindergarten in Tony Riverdale,  Shoshana gave him a gentle warning.  Sorry.  It's just a funny name, I guess.  Boy, if that doesn't help Anthony's argument. 
[02:28:30]  What?  Anyway, I didn't say anything, I didn't say anything either.  Shoshana gave him a gentle warning.  Yeah.  Her five-year-old son, uh, going to kindergarten.  Never let an adult touch you there, is what she said to her five-year-old.  Okay?  Yeah.  And then, uh, the little boy heeded his mom's advice, but her words didn't go far enough.  Slowly, the stories trickled out of PS24 in the Bronx.  Alarming stuff.  The boy talked about games in the schoolyard. 
[02:29:00]  Naked games.  Hmm.  Games also were played in the school bathroom, involving acts more commonly associated with  the President of the United States than with five-year-old tots.  Ha!  What, were they signing bills into law?  Ha!  I believe the five-year-olds were, uh, well, doing what, you know.  Well, with alarm, Shoshana realized that the males who posed the threat to her son were  not adults, Anthony.  They learned it from me, okay?  They learned it from me.  Uh, let's see. 
[02:29:30]  Her precious boy was being sexually molested by other five-year-olds.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  My husband...  Do you like having your back rub?  No, no, it's another five-year-old.  Oh, okay.  We're not talking pedophiles here today.  My husband and I were in shock, Shoshana told me.  I was crying.  Never in my life did I imagine that this could be done by other kids.  Timber!  Shoshana, this doesn't sound right.  Shoshana, a travel agent worker, originally from Israel? 
[02:30:00]  Hey!  Wow.  Where did that happen?  I don't know.  That screws everything up.  She thought she could trust her son in public school.  So she talked to other parents about what was going on in this school.  The revelations were astounding, Shoshana said.  A mother with a boy in kindergarten told Shoshana that another child had grabbed her son's junk in the schoolyard.  Whoa!  A third mother relayed a similar tale about group sex play in the bathroom. 
[02:30:30]  Hmm.  Wow.  Some blame the media.  Enough with blaming the media.  Some blame the internet.  Internet.  Five-year-olds on the internet going to porn sites, right?  You read down on that one?  Where?  Where are you going?  Some blame the media, the internet.  Right.  Or the parents.  But how can you explain a pack of seven-year-old Harlem boys who recently forced a little girl to perform oral sex?  No, I can't say it. 
[02:31:00]  I can't say it.  I just stopped myself.  You know what?  For the first time, I just stopped myself.  You don't have to be, uh...  You don't have to be so obvious.  What?  Who...  Please, is there somebody who doesn't know what we're talking about out there, please?  Anyone?  Let me know.  Let me know.  Come on.  Right.  Timmy doesn't.  My goodness.  Oh, Rick, don't even.  The NOW organization checking in, it's that damn wow. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, that's what it is.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Yes, that's...  That's the evil out there.  Well, I think they learn it from their parents.  Or parent.  You know what I mean?  If there's a kindergarten kid, and he's in an apartment building or something, and mom's is a...  Mom is a...  Mom's.  ...is having the sex and stuff in front of everybody.  Uh-huh.  You know, sometimes that happens. 
[02:32:00]  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Well, Ant, that certain segment of society you speak of, aren't they 17 still in kindergarten?  Oh, my God.  Stop.  Oh, my God.  I gotta hang up on him.  I apologize to our faithful listeners.  No, not one description of anybody that we're talking about is gonna get through today.  I swear to you.  Wendy, what's going on?  Hey, um, foreplay in first grade.  Hmm.  Catholic Grammar School.  Uh, teacher put two desks together. 
[02:32:30]  I was sitting next to a boy.  And it was not sexual at all, to be honest with you.  I really didn't know what that was at that time, but kind of playing around with the old hand down there.  What, him on you or you on him?  Him on me.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  And what was it, the teacher?  No, no, no.  Oh, oh, it was another student.  No, another student, but the teacher had us sitting in a bag next to each other.  In first grade, he was petting the poodle?  Yeah, first grade.  I didn't even know what, you know, it was really wrong. 
[02:33:00]  I just, we were just curious.  How about that?  I don't know.  Well, that's it.  Where were you, uh, you loose girls when I was in first grade?  All right, thank you, Wendy.  You're welcome.  Let's go to Jesse.  Jesse, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Um, my sister's in junior high school, and a whole bunch of her friends got caught in  the hall giving hummers to a whole bunch of demonstrate guys, and now they're having  assemblies and stuff that they have to teach the kids that it's wrong to do it in the 
[02:33:30]  high school.  What a great school that would be to go to.  Oh, my God.  Wasn't happening in junior high?  Like, you'd have to work and get a girlfriend and, you know, go through all the proper channels.  It wasn't like, uh, oh, there's the third period bell.  Let me just, uh, get a quickie and then go into class.  Or collect enough money from your paper route, Anthony.  Yes.  To go buy one.  Wow.  That's going on, huh?  Pretty sick. 
[02:34:00]  Thank you.  Welcome.  Bye.  Bye.  Somebody just, I guess, the girl that was telling the kindergarten story with the boy that  was, uh, petting the photo.  Yeah.  Dale from Jersey saying, I'm betting wood floor.  Yeah, sick biz.  All right, we got a counselor on the line.  Tom, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I got a good one for you.  Yeah.  When I was younger, I was a camp counselor.  I was, like, a counselor in training.  So, uh, we're at the pool.  One of the lifeguards, I'm talking to her, and so if we look over, there's two little boys 
[02:34:30]  just sitting up against the fence.  They're, like, kissing each other and touching each other all over.  We walk up to them.  We're, like, what the hell are you guys doing?  They go, oh, nothing.  We're just playing googies.  Playing googies.  I was, like, what the hell is this?  Playing googies.  Yep.  I, S-U-NOT.  Very good.  Um, Joe Soprano checking in, Anthony, from foundrymusic.com.  These are the kind of people that yell in the movie theaters, right?  I don't know.  Oh, jeez.  Joe just trying to figure out who you're talking about, Anthony. 
[02:35:00]  Uh, Glenn, what's going on?  Hey, Glenn.  Yes, hey, what's happening?  What's up?  No, I see you can't blame the little African-American kids.  They probably, you know.  All right.  But they probably got junk like grown-ups, you know?  We're not talking about anyone specifically here on the program.  No.  Hey, Brian, what's up?  Hey, guys, how's it going?  Good.  Um, I just wanted to, you know, add in, you know, I'm almost 30 years old, and this is 
[02:35:30]  nothing new.  You know, this stuff goes on all the time.  When I was six years old, I, I had a girl, you know, I, I remember I had her in the bathroom,  and I was like, I was telling her to kiss, you know, my junk, not, no, I didn't say junk,  you know, I, I was telling her to kiss it, and then by the time I was 10.  You kiss it, you kiss it, you dirty mom.  By the time I was 10, I, I had a girl, you know, suck my, my junk, you know?  So, I mean, uh, uh, and, and, you know, I didn't get it from my parents or anything. 
[02:36:00]  I just think it's kind of like instinctual, you know, like you just.  Instinctual?  Really, Spaz?  Well, I don't know.  Instinctual.  Well, all right, that's, they got me there.  That's a Spaz-ism.  Um, no, I think it's instinctive.  You know, I, you know, I, I think it's instinctive that, you know, you, there's certain,  there's a, there's a sexual instinct that you have, a sexual drive.  Right.  You know, I don't think it comes from, like, you know, the internet or the wow or anything like that.  Yeah, but there, it might be instinctual, but, uh, you know, I, I believe you kind of know in your head 
[02:36:30]  what's appropriate and what's not, even in kindergarten, you know what I mean?  Like, like the, the showing each other the hiney thing, even we at that age knew that no one could see us do it,  because it was, it was kind of like a taboo.  Not right to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  Well, all right, I just wanted to chime in, guys.  Take care.  I love your shop.  Thanks, Brian.  One time at band camp.  That was a great, great scene. 
[02:37:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  It always seems like, uh, it's in the schools that aren't in the best of neighborhoods.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen elsewhere.  I'm just saying every time I read about it, seems to be a certain neighborhood.  That's all.  I had no clue I could get action in kindergarten.  You couldn't.  How do you know?  I, what do you mean?  What kind of action?  You big gang BJs in the bathroom?  That's what the article said. 
[02:37:30]  You couldn't even go to the bathroom in kindergarten.  Wasn't the bathroom like in the same, it was in the classroom.  Right.  You raised your hand, you went to the bathroom, you were done.  Did you remember to wipe your mouth?  You know, new little rules.  We're going to learn about BJs today, boys and girls.  Hi, it's your old pal, Barney.  No.  Show Barney where the person touched you.  Look at that.  Look at it grow. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's turning a shade of purple just like Barney.  Oh, boy, oh, boy.  We're having fun today, kids, aren't we?  Here comes Baby Bop.  Oh, boy.  He's got a dinosaur in his pants, too.  Oh, yes, do, boy. 
[02:38:30]  Now, just keep kissing.  That's it.  You kiss him all over.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to do you right in your Harry Potter.  No.  Now, don't forget to swallow.  Bye-bye.  And remember, I love you.  The purple-headed monster.  And it's not Barney.  Look what I did to you again.  Dude, I love you.  Bend over, Baby Bop. 
[02:39:00]  I'm going to slam your back door.  Come here.  Come here, Mary.  This is called prison lube.  That's what we used in the joint.  Suck it.  Suck it, you bitch.  Look at Barney's yam bag.  It's big and purple. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, boy.  Remember to always drink your banana juice.  Just like Baby Bop.  Okay, girls.  We're going to play on the monkey bars as Barney lays here underneath,  looking up to spot you.  Oh, look at that dirty little whore.  Oh, boy. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, Rick, get out of here.  Just leave.  You are disgusting.  All right, Crazy B from Jersey.  Crazy B from Jersey on the instant feedback.  I can one-up all these callers, Anthony.  All right.  When I was in the womb, I would reach down and, you know,  pet mommy's panty perch. 
[02:40:30]  Great.  Louie Anderson checking in.  I still play googies.  Show me googies.  Yeah.  No, we ain't playing.  Turning googies into comedy.  Yes.  Googies.  I usually get a big load of googies in my mouth.  God damn, Louie.  Okay, we have to take a break, Anthony.  Oh, sure, sure. 
[02:41:00]  Yes, yes, we do.  You guys sometimes, like, piss me off, okay?  1027 WNEW.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  How are you?  Look, I'm a little sick of you guys saying that you're going to play something.  Yeah.  Then you go to break.  I know.  Then you do another bit, and then you go to break.  Yeah, that old gag.  I know.  It doesn't happen on purpose.  You're doing it all the time, though.  You're starting to sound like other people. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Well, what happened?  I'll be honest.  We want to play the insect song from the retards.  It's great.  If you haven't heard yet, we're going to play it.  We're going to play it here, okay?  All right.  That's cool, then.  Are you going to play it?  Yeah, right now.  We would have played it if you didn't call, but now we've got to take a break.  No, I'm kidding.  No.  No.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You rule.  Thank you.  See you.  We should get Otto and George in here, because he needs to hear the song, too.  Yeah, this is amazing.  Well, we want to get Otto on the air with us here, because this is right down his sick  and twisted alley.  Thanks, Rick.  His fucking lovely wife. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It's Otto, Anthony.  Yes.  And his puppet, George.  Of course, George with him.  Greetings.  Always by his side.  What I don't understand is this is radio, and he really doesn't need to bring George  in to do this bit, but he does anyway.  I don't know.  Can we get any more fat tourists on the streets here so I can't walk up to this goddamn radio  station?  Don't you love it?  Hi, George.  You've got to get a syringe with AIDS in it and start sticking it in him.  Get out of my way.  You've got to do all in A. 
[02:42:30]  Wow, George.  We missed you, George.  You know, I really missed you guys.  No, I said I missed George.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, shut up.  They missed George.  No, we missed Otto, too.  I'm just his liaison.  I just want to say to all your listeners that you guys are really great.  I've done a lot of radio recently, and it stinks everywhere.  It's horrible.  Anyone you want to name?  Yeah, man cow in Chicago.  What a bag of douche this guy was.  You know?  And plus you're on in the afternoon, and I got, you know, one of the things I like about  showbiz is he's sleeping late. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  I'm getting up earlier than a farmer now to do these radio shows.  And then they leave you sitting outside, and this guy had a tremendous poster of himself  in the front office.  Can you believe that?  What a conceited, untalent prick this guy was.  Yeah, yeah.  Just really.  I love you now.  He is such a dick.  Otto, do you see any posters of Aunt and I around here?  Please.  No, you guys are just there.  We have nothing.  We have stupid wow stickers.  That's it.  No, it's very, you guys are just in here working and being funny, mostly, which I respect 
[02:43:30]  for four hours a day.  This guy said nothing, you know?  And then he started going, oh, comics are all bitter, they're all angry.  And then he started ranting about this guy, Craig Shoemaker.  He's doing the same 20 minutes for 10 years.  I go, well, what should he do?  You know, it's a great 20 minutes.  He's touring the country.  You know, he can do your job, and you can never do Craig's job, you know?  Right.  This guy really stinks.  So.  You know, on top of that, he ripped off or whipped him out Wednesday.  Did he?  Yeah.  That just infuriates us. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, he's just nothing.  Absolutely infuriates us.  He's an ass.  Yeah, he really is, man.  I hear he's, like, really nasty when they go to break and stuff.  Yeah.  Like, to his work, the people that he works with and stuff, he's very, he yells at him  and crap like that.  Yeah, I just got, I just did not click with this guy immediately.  And then I kind of clammed up, and I wasn't talking.  And he started panicking.  I saw him grabbing tapes, like, what am I going to do?  He thought he had an hour, you know, that I would try and, you know, fill for him, hopefully. 
[02:44:30]  Right.  But, um, that's great.  That was my reaction.  I just clammed up and gave him nothing instead of convincing him, you know.  Good, good.  That's hilarious.  It was horrible.  If something doesn't work in our show, we're like, eh, whatever, that didn't work.  We'll, uh, I don't know, we'll move on to something else.  But you guys are never at a loss for words.  This guy had eight, like, sidekicks, these retarded misfit crew that he has.  Yeah.  It was just pathetic.  I don't know who he's trying to imitate, but he's not even close to being a second worst or whatever.  He's a horrible, horrible person.  There you go. 
[02:45:00]  O-N-A rule.  An endorsement for man crotch.  Yeah.  And George isn't saying anything.  George, did you have a bad time on another radio show there?  Pussah!  Yeah, you see that?  We got that one?  Pussah!  Pussah!  Pussah!  You don't need it.  Dooling Pussah!  Otto's all fun.  No, we don't need it anymore.  That's like our most popular sound clip now.  People love the...  Pussah!  One question.  I haven't been listening since you first came on. 
[02:45:30]  What's that thing, uh, birthday, that I hear all the time?  The guy goes, birthday.  What is that?  Birthday?  What is that?  Hmm.  I don't know which one you're talking about now.  Sounds like a retard saying birthday.  Oh, Timmy?  Yeah.  Oh, this guy.  Timmy!  That guy?  No, it's another thing.  It sounds like birthday.  Oh, my God.  You don't know what I'm talking about?  Oh, Corky?  It's probably a Corky clip.  Corky, yeah.  From Life Goes On.  Oh, okay.  Because I didn't know what it was, but I laughed anyway. 
[02:46:00]  That's always good.  Yeah.  Anytime there's, uh, retarded, uh, children.  Yes, yes.  Now, speaking of, uh, retards, we got to play this song because people are going to get  pissed at us.  Yeah, I heard that guy, yeah.  Uh, did you hear, uh, the insect song earlier?  No.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Uh, why don't you explain to Otto what this song is all about?  Okay, uh, a group of, uh, retarded children at a very special school somewhere.  Uh, somebody thought it was a good idea to gather them all up, get some really bad synthesizers  and, uh, drum machines, and, uh, have them sing songs about, uh, whatever weird stuff 
[02:46:30]  is going on in their deficient brains.  And, uh, the result is just pure magic, I would, I would say.  Yeah, so we debuted this song, Insects, about two hours ago.  Insects?  I guess they did just picture bugs crawling on them in their head or booms or something.  Wow.  So we're trying to get this song stuck in everyone's head today so they'll, they'll be humming  it in the middle of the night and stuff.  Okay.  So.  We have to listen to this together.  Oh, no.  Insects. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  It rocks.  A little bit of an 80s Miami lifestyle.  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  You're kidding me.  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  Insects will get you.  Yeah.  If you accidentally fall in the water, you're in trouble. 
[02:47:30]  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  You better watch out for the insects to get you. 
[02:48:00]  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  What is he saying?  What is he saying?  What is he saying?  Right on in the trees.  In the water, you're in trouble.  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  You better watch out for the insects to get you.  You better watch out for the insects to get you. 
[02:48:30]  You better watch out on the insects to get you.  You better watch out on the insects to get you.  Almost done. 
[02:49:00]  Spice, little spice, you steal your food.  We don't like them.  Shit is coming.  Get a dog, baby.  Get a dog, baby.  Everybody.  Nice note.  Here we go.  You better watch out on the insects to get you.  Shut up! 
[02:49:30]  You better watch out on the insects to get you.  You better watch out on the insects to get you.  You better watch out on the insects to get you.  You better watch out on the insects to get you.  There you go.  You better watch out on the insects to get you.  Marissa writing Stop the Insanity.  I can't take this anymore.  I'm not reading that, Opie.  I'm saying it.  I can't take this anymore. 
[02:50:00]  You better watch out on the insects to get you.  Oh, my God.  Why did you choose him as the lead singer?  Like, they got the backup guys.  And then, was this guy the best guy they could come up with?  He's the guy with the 612.  He's great.  Also, we're getting emails from people.  Is this the sound?  Butt sex.  That's the one.  He's saying butt sex.  Oh, butt sex?  Birthday.  Birthday, butt sex.  Whatever.  Butt sex.  It makes you laugh. 
[02:50:30]  Who cares?  Who is that?  A guy from South Park.  Mr. Garrison.  Mr. Garrison, the teacher.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Hey, this is it.  Vagina.  Oh, okay.  Now I know who that is.  Butt sex.  Not birthday.  Birthday, butt sex.  Birthday.  You get it confused all the time.  Yeah.  Butt sex.  Yeah, so that song is sweeping the nation.  That's a winner.  Quincy Jones should be very proud.  Yeah.  He should produce their next CD. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, man.  People will be humming that in their sleep tonight.  The flies will eat your food.  That's the only line I got.  I heard something about mosquitoes and cucarachas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then spiders.  And something about drowning.  And falling in the water.  Water, right.  And spiders getting you or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can just imagine what's going through their heads if they come up with that.  Do they have bugs?  Mickey and the mentals?  Is that the name of that group or anything?  Oh, my God.  Just going by the name The Retard. 
[02:51:30]  Did George like that song over there?  Oh, really good.  Really good.  Yeah.  All right.  Singing retards.  Yeah.  Boy, this six to seven hours is really slipping here.  Oh, man.  What?  You didn't find that funny, George?  What are we going to do next?  Knock soda cans together?  Coming up at 6.15, knocking soda cans together.  Yeah.  Not a bad idea.  That wasn't bad.  Six to seven hour songs are in line near that next time.  Singing retards. 
[02:52:00]  I won't be able to sleep now.  All right.  Hey, George.  Are any f***s coming up here?  I waste my time.  You missed the boobage.  We had that yesterday.  Goddamn yesterday, we had girls on all fours, and we were throwing cherries into their bong.  Oh, really?  Into their hoops.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Oh.  Did I miss that?  Yeah.  Now, instead, you're hanging out with a bunch of sweaty guys.  Yeah.  Guys again.  Yeah.  We're here with the Weight Watchers group here singing retards.  No, it's good. 
[02:52:30]  It's good.  It's okay.  George, can you help us out?  We got a couple of complaint calls about the retard song.  Okay.  Help us out, George.  Hey, what's your problem?  Denise.  Yes?  Hello?  What's your problem, George?  Well, I mean, it's sad.  I mean, you know, really.  What's sad?  About the retards.  You know how many people have problems in this world?  Well, they're enjoying themselves.  They're expressing themselves.  What?  You're making fun of them?  They're enjoying themselves?  We're laughing.  What are you going to do?  It's tragic.  You're not laughing with them.  You're laughing at them. 
[02:53:00]  There's no cure for mental retardation.  You don't laugh at them or it's you're in pain.  So you shouldn't make fun of them.  Why?  They don't know.  They don't know.  They don't know we're laughing at them and not with them.  Why are they putting out a CD?  Yeah, right.  They're putting out a CD.  It's you guys making putting out a CD.  Who put the CD?  Make fun of these people.  They put the CD out.  That's an actual CD.  What do you think?  People are going to buy the CD, put it on with their family and smile and go, this is  so nice.  Or go, this is a retard.  Be real. 
[02:53:30]  You know, why don't you guys be real?  It's an actual CD by a bunch of high school retard kids.  Well, you know, there's a lot of mentally retarded people out there.  Who's retarded in Denise's family?  Be honest.  Come on.  There's nobody retarded in my family.  It's you.  It's you, Denise, isn't it?  It's you, Denise, isn't it?  Mother Nature.  It's Mother Nature.  I'm not a chick.  I just want to know somebody who works in a school with these mentally retarded people.  Oh, okay.  And I don't think it's nice at all.  So you're banging a guy that works in a school? 
[02:54:00]  No, I'm not banging a guy that works in a school, okay?  You're banging a woman that works in a school?  You're marrying a guy that works in a school.  Oh, you're marrying a guy?  And you guys are, like, f***ing totally disgusted.  Whoa.  Yeah.  You got to watch.  Oh, you got to watch the language.  You hear that?  Look at her.  She cursed.  She cursed.  What the f***s?  Wait a minute.  Now George is cursing.  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Just because the listener curses doesn't mean you can curse, George.  Wow.  And that said, you laughed at the retards.  Go make a bun cake or do something with yourself. 
[02:54:30]  You're ready to walk.  George is very pissed off.  How do you really feel, George?  Come on.  Come on.  That wasn't funny, singing retards?  I hope for a Christmas album.  What is her problem?  Like a listener said earlier, you know, you don't ask blind people to drive.  You shouldn't have retards singing and putting out CDs.  Retards singing.  Of course we're going to laugh.  And then you hear the mouth on her.  She's trying to be all nice and sweet.  And the first time she gets a little angry, she's throwing the F word out. 
[02:55:00]  What if she gets upset with one of her husband's retarded students?  Yeah.  She might turn around and just say, hey, you effing retard.  Yeah.  And the kid will cry.  Does someone who's profoundly retarded know when someone's laughing at them or with them?  No.  I'm going to kill you.  I can't take that.  I swear to God, if you've got somebody that's really retarded, are they going to know when  they do something if you're laughing at them or with them? 
[02:55:30]  No, they don't have a clue.  No clue.  The people that aren't retarded that are in this situation will be upset.  Right.  Not the retarded person.  Right.  They're smiling at everything.  They're smiling at a train wreck.  Singing retards.  Get a tape recorder.  Yeah.  All right.  George is just very, very pissed off today.  Very pissed.  He's cursing up a storm.  Brian, what's up?  That was the funniest fricking song I've ever heard.  How could she be complaining about that? 
[02:56:00]  Because she's a whore.  I can't believe she called it.  Who was it?  Someone said it right on the nose.  They said that somebody in her family is retarded.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You have to be because that song was hysterical.  Why put out a CD?  They don't want you to laugh at them.  Exactly.  I don't understand.  People think you're going to pop that CD in it while you're driving your car for easy  listening music.  Or put it on at a party or something like that.  That is made to put in and laugh at.  Hey, man.  I just got to tell you.  I'm coming home to Garden State Parkway. 
[02:56:30]  I put my wow sticker on my car yesterday.  I got wowed on my way home.  Hey, congratulations.  Oh, I'm so excited.  It's the greatest show I've ever heard.  Congratulations, guys.  Thank you, Brian.  Thanks.  Psycho Mark loving George, the puppet over there.  He got a spank at the f***ing daddy.  I need to lick some of his.  That guy's way too happy.  None of this is making the radio today.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Lewis, what's up?  God, what an annoying little freaking Muppet. 
[02:57:00]  What a Muppet?  It's a puppet.  Little freaking Muppet.  Hey, hey, hey.  Doesn't this stupid piece of wood have a job being a toothpick on the weekend for a fat guy?  Why is it always the same lame joke that these guys have to die?  Toothpick.  Wait a minute.  That was good, sir.  Now, swear your car into a pole and taste your own blood.  Sir.  Dude, I got to admit it. 
[02:57:30]  The puppet's freaking funny.  Of course it is.  The puppet's freaking funny.  Thank you.  I'm sure the puppet will get a job on his own and leave that loser behind.  Laugh at the retards and hit a pole.  All right, Lewis.  Take care, dude.  Bye-bye.  Otto and George, one of our faves these days.  I don't know which part of that call to believe.  Or take as an insult.  Paychecks and pussy and retards.  Oh, my.  We're setting a new dumping record today.  John, the dump guy, has dumped six times in the last two minutes. 
[02:58:00]  Thank you, George.  He wasn't eating at that chicken place again, was he?  No.  No.  The other kind of dumping.  Yeah.  Now, George.  Yes, sir.  Do you have kid touchers touching you?  What's that?  Kid touchers?  What'd she say?  I don't know.  He is a little small.  He might be mistaken for a child.  Are you mistaken for a child at times and have kid touchers touching you and offering you candy?  No members from Nambla. 
[02:58:30]  Show us on the doll where he touched you.  Oh, child molesting?  Yeah.  Now I'm against it.  You get blood on your clown suit.  Yeah.  That's not good.  That's not good.  Holy cow.  That's not good.  No, I wasn't saying you were doing the kid touching.  Oh.  Oh, me?  I was saying, like, yeah, middle-aged men touching you.  I should get that lucky.  How come I don't get laid when they're wilding out there?  Somebody's squirking the water.  Pull my pants down already.  I'm lonely.  The Puerto Ricans. 
[02:59:00]  I never knew you could do that in New York.  I see a lot of asses I want to make naked.  I don't do it.  God bless the PRs.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Yeah.  God bless the PRs, Opie.  Man cow sucks.  What a bag of douche that guy was.  You're getting warmed up now, George.  A douche nozzle.  Oh, did he suck?  Conceited zilch. 
[02:59:30]  A big life-size or full-wall picture.  Yeah, it was the size of a building.  That's great.  His grinning face is annoying.  I'm too pompous.  That's very pompous.  I mean, there's other comics.  Joe Miller is sitting there for an hour and a half.  They keep going, would you want coffee?  You want water?  You want coffee?  No, I want to go in the air, and then I want to go back to bed.  Yeah.  You know, I only have maybe an hour in the morning where I can do anything remotely funny.  After three coffees, I have maybe 45 minutes where I'm awake enough that I can speak. 
[03:00:00]  And that was spent sitting, twirling my thumbs in his outer office while he was taking phone calls.  It was really rude, you know.  And looking at a poster of him.  Yeah.  That's great.  And then when I got in there, he wouldn't even talk to me.  He was still taking calls.  Just a jerk.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Well, you crack us up.  Old Dirty.  A Dominican on the line.  Our pal.  OG, what up?  Yo, what up, Troy?  What up?  Antonio with the new hairdo, my man. 
[03:00:30]  Jesus.  Chilling or what?  Yeah, I'm chilling, G.  Dirty.  Uh-oh.  I'm chilling, money.  Hey, O.D.  Yo, what up, Troy?  George wants to talk to you.  Who, the puppet?  Yeah, the puppet.  Man, you can drink.  I seen you at the party, man.  Jesus.  You like that, right?  Yeah, leaving with Coronas.  That's cool.  Yeah, he was trying to steal Coronas from the party.  He stole Coronas at our last road show.  I know.  Yo, how many times am I going to have to clarify the point?  I did not steal.  Whatever.  What party favors? 
[03:01:00]  What do you got for George today?  We're talking about the Wilding and Central Park and other fun things.  Yo, man, wait a minute.  Keep touching.  Yo, let me tell you something.  You're still in a Corona when you hopped the turnstile on the way home?  I tried to drink it before I hopped the turnstile.  That's cool.  I don't want to drop my Corona on the way down.  Is he outside with a knife?  No, no, it's a phone call.  Okay.  Because they carry knives.  They don't all carry knives.  The ones that don't carry knives have plastic explosives.  Yeah, I'm going to kill this puppy. 
[03:01:30]  I want to kill a puppy, you know?  Oh, my gosh.  Yo, listen.  Just chill.  Yeah, just chill.  You better chill, George.  The pussy is free because of the crap course money.  They don't ride them like that anymore.  How dirty?  Why did he call them all dirty?  I don't know.  I don't know what's making the radio.  The Puerto Rican parade was great.  You're just ripping into O.D.  20 million Puerto Ricans, six cars. 
[03:02:00]  Easy.  Psycho, Mark.  Psycho.  Oh, God.  This is debauchery mania.  Prostate exams for everyone.  We're hanging out with Otto and George.  We highly recommend everyone go see Otto and George tonight.  Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy, warming up, right? 
[03:02:30]  Actually, Tuesday he's working with me.  Oh, he's just going to hang out with you.  He's just going to hang out with you.  Oh, when you say Jeff Norris will be there, I'm figuring he's going to do a few minutes.  He makes himself known, but he's not really on the list.  But last time I actually got him on by badgering them for about an hour.  All right, very good.  Hopefully you'll have another 14-year-old in the front row, like the last time we saw you at Caroline's.  14-year-old girl in the front row.  He's saying, F this, see this.  I can't hang my hat in Brooklyn. 
[03:03:00]  George, you having a good time today?  Yeah, this is good.  I'm enjoying myself.  Yeah.  This ain't too bad.  Yeah.  This is nice.  The cappuccino machine's working.  Yeah, everything's good.  You keep looking at Psycho Mark.  You have a problem with Psycho Mark?  Got a hammer over there.  What's he doing?  Well, that's the mallet.  We've been smashing CDs lately.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I thought he was going to do some kind of a Gallagher act where he smashes a big watermelon or something.  Where do you smash them?  Right there?  Yeah, right there.  Listen to this.  This is painfully loud, and the CD disintegrates. 
[03:03:30]  We love destruction in this place.  Let her rip?  Yeah, let her rip.  Look how huge the mallet is.  It's hilarious.  There's one last Bruce CD.  Oh, one last Bruce CD?  All right.  Okay.  Listen to this.  Listen to this, Otto.  Yeah.  I got a shot of plastic in my pecker.  I got a shot of plastic.  Springsteen sucks anyway.  Can't start a fire without a spark.  No s***, you dumb doll from New Jersey.  George, oh my God. 
[03:04:00]  We want these jokes on the radio.  No one heard the punchline now.  Yeah.  And then his big song, born in the USA, born in the USA, born in the USA.  One more time for the brain dead.  What's the name of that song?  Loser.  Write a new song, you jack-off.  Oh my God. 
[03:04:30]  Dancing in the dark.  Got a shot of plastic in my elbow.  You have an opinion about everyone, George.  What do you think of John Rocker?  He's coming back to play the Mets soon.  Oh, the racist guy?  Love him.  Love him.  Love him.  Did you ride the subway lately?  I'm on a f***ing toilet.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You just cursed again.  We dumped out again, George.  I'm just so loose here.  Now, I'm looking at the dump button.  It is not lit anymore. 
[03:05:00]  We could be going to a Van Halen song once again today.  Oh, really?  All right, so I guess we asked you about John Rocker and George.  You love him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, the subway stuff.  You said something about the subways being full of brown people or something like that?  Yes, it was about people.  Is he wrong?  No.  No.  So?  It's not a racist remark.  He's observing what's going on.  It was something about people with blue hair and then queers with AIDS. 
[03:05:30]  And what else did he say?  20-year-old girls with four children.  But still, that covers the subways, I think.  You know, he's a great athlete.  You know, if anybody asks him a question, it's a stupid thing anyway.  What's an athlete going to tell you?  They're just jocks, you know?  Yeah.  They have nothing to say.  Supposed to know something else than a throw-ed-the ball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  He's got a point.  Not as angry as I would have liked, but he's got a point.  Well, I don't curse, though.  No, no, you don't. 
[03:06:00]  You get logic from me.  You get humor and filth from this one.  Someone said we ought to put the retard song in the thing instead of the Van Halen song.  So when we do run out of dump, instead of going to the Van Halen song, it goes to the retard song.  There's actually a decent percussionist in there somewhere. 
[03:06:30]  There's something going on in there, yeah.  It's going to synthesize the drums.  It's called a Casio.  A Casio conga.  It's so sad.  Oh, man.  All right.  Goddamn.  That's awful.  The Lost Classic from Mickey and the Mentals.  Satan from Hell.  George will be the first puppet in Hell.  Oh, all right.  Oh, very funny.  Man cut his hair to look younger so his girlfriend could introduce him to her parents. 
[03:07:00]  I got to say, even though I don't read all of them, I've read every one of your, you know, we don't read them on the air.  Every, like, fifth instant feedback is the same old gag.  Very funny.  Some girl asking, I hear all the jokes.  How old is your girlfriend?  I will go on the record right now and say, she is 15.  What?  Is that bad?  What?  Is that bad, George?  No, not if you're in show business, no. 
[03:07:30]  15, geez.  You like banging the young ones there, George?  Sure.  Yeah.  Sure.  Get the Snoopy vibrator.  They like that.  They like that, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Ah, God damn.  You're a twisted F, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Dolly, what's up?  Hey, nothing much.  I really wanted to come and show you guys my big breasts.  I want to come to the studio, hopefully. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are you the girl from earlier that was wowing people?  I do wow them a lot.  You have the 44 eyes?  I'm a 38 eye.  38 eye.  Yeah.  I have the Guinness record for having the largest natural breasts in the USA.  Wow.  Hi, this is my sexy voice.  Hi.  What are you, Minnie Mouse?  George is a little pissed off at you and your big breasts there.  Hi.  Hi.  I get it a lot from girls. 
[03:08:30]  They're always screaming at me because I don't cover up a lot.  And they're like, put on some bras.  And I don't really go out with bras.  No, huh?  No.  Why should I?  Do they fall to the floor?  No.  They're very firm.  Yeah.  Put on some bras?  How many this shit's got?  Well, put a bra on.  Get a catcher's mitt.  You want to come in tomorrow?  We'll recognize you when you show up at the front door.  Now, do you actually hold the Guinness record for the largest natural breasts? 
[03:09:00]  Really?  I do, yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  How many times have you been TF'd?  Oh.  Yeah, the TF is like the big feature when you bed this chick, I bet, right?  What's TF?  A lot.  T-F-ing?  A lot.  Wait, wait.  Oh.  Yeah.  We had to give Otto some sign.  You grab the T's, you squish them together, and you F the hell out of them.  Yes.  T-F-ing.  Okay.  See, we could get around all those laws.  Everyone knows exactly what we just said.  George, are you into TF-ing girls with big boobs?  What is your website, sweetheart? 
[03:09:30]  I want to give you a plug.  Uh-oh.  Is that dirtylittleskank.com?  What is that?  It's princessdoll.com.  Princessdoll.  Yeah.  Princessdoll.  Yeah.  Dot com.  What's on your website?  Well, at the moment, I just have some pictures.  I am working on it.  Big nipple with a hot **** laying on it.  Daddy's little girl.  I'd like to strangle her. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Well, you want to come in tomorrow, Dolly?  Sure.  There she is.  Yeah.  There she is.  All right.  Well, I'm looking at her picture.  Let me punch up some more.  Her younger years.  Turn this around, Ann.  Let me take a look, too.  Real fast look there.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  There we go.  Touch my schmeckle.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  You got some big hooters there.  All right.  Thanks.  And how old are you in the younger years picture?  I'm 18. 
[03:10:30]  Yes, you are, aren't you?  Yes.  I'm going to recent pictures, but now our whorebag listeners have invaded the site.  Slowing it down to a snail's pace.  Horny little bastards.  Do you do any boob tricks?  Well, I can shake them around, and they can go round and round.  Can you hold things underneath them?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Can we get a scale and weigh them?  Yeah.  You can do that.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  And then we'll have listeners guess how much your boobs weigh for a prize.  Holy smoke. 
[03:11:00]  Look at her on the beach.  Let me see.  Turn that around.  Look at that.  Wow.  That was taken last year, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Will she smash a CD with one of the...  Hey, how about that?  Yeah.  Smash a CD.  Oh, God.  Let me pop that one up.  I'm going to full-size this picture here.  Oh, you whore, horny listeners we got.  Yeah.  Look at them.  The site's getting pounded.  Look at this top picture.  Wow.  Those are huge.  Now, will you remove your top when you come in?  Sure, definitely.  I want to love you guys. 
[03:11:30]  Definitely.  Are you Spanish?  No, actually, Middle Eastern.  Middle East.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Egyptian.  So, you're safe over there, right?  You know.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm American.  I'm American-born.  Oh, okay.  So, I consider myself...  You ever get mistaken for a cow over there?  Oh, no.  I don't think I look like...  Yes, you do.  God, how could you mistake me for a cow?  You're a silly fat cow and a whore.  George. 
[03:12:00]  You've got to excuse George.  George, he's a little angry today.  Just kidding.  Why are you mad at me?  I like you.  He's an angry puppet.  I'm only kidding.  I'm only kidding.  He's an angry puppet.  He's angry at everyone.  Yeah.  He's only four foot, three foot tall.  Look at those jugs.  Right here.  You lube that area that I'm pointing at right there.  Wow.  Oh.  All right.  Just take your C and you slam it between these T's and your F and F until you see all  over them. 
[03:12:30]  Could you get something beside French's mustard with the hot dogs at the 7-Eleven?  All you got is that watery yellow stuff, you know?  Can't you get goldens?  You're Indian, right?  Oh, God.  I hate the yellow mustard.  Get that brown stuff in there.  Do something besides show the ****.  I will.  I will.  I'm working on it.  Whole country starving.  You're over here showing the knockers. 
[03:13:00]  Get to work.  Oh, my God.  Well, why is he so upset?  People are starving in the street and eating rice.  She's going, look at that ****.  Here's my website.  I'm a whore from India.  We got yellow mustard.  Kill yourself.  I'm not a whore.  I love to dress sexy.  Yeah.  Yeah, Gandhi did, too.  He got shot in the belly for his effort.  He's a very angry puppet that you're speaking with.  You must understand.  You're going to be here tomorrow. 
[03:13:30]  Get that watery yellow mustard.  You must understand.  I'm afraid he might attack me.  Disgusting **** relish.  That ain't going to make it.  Silly fat cow.  Bull.  All I have to say is, man, you got to hear the unedited show.  Oh, my God.  I know George, man.  He's off the hook.  There she is laying on the trunk of a car.  Yeah.  There it is.  Dotheadwhore.com.  That's easy to remember.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:00]  Dotheadwhore.com.  Look at my jugs.  My whole **** country is starving.  Again, again.  Just wait until we replay this with the bleep shint.  Look, once again, the dump button, completely dark.  Yeah.  And John is on the button, freaking out.  We are so close to hearing Van Halen.  He's having a nervous breakdown back there.  How come they set, like, female children on fire in India?  It went like they want a male child.  I'm not from India. 
[03:14:30]  I'm not from India.  Where are you from?  I just told you.  My mom is Chinese.  My father is a Middle Eastern Egyptian, and I'm an American-born.  And a knee of the Jews with big jokes.  And a knee of the Jews.  All right.  We have to take a break.  Why don't you say goodbye to George?  Bye, George.  Goodbye, darling.  I'll be masturbating to an old Dick Van Dyke rerun tonight.  The website did nothing for me.  Oh, my God. 
[03:15:00]  Well, what kind of website do you like, George?  I don't know.  She looked like something that wandered out of an Oscar Mayer plant.  Silly fat cow.  Dothead.com.  You dick fat, silly cow.  Kill yourself.  All right, now.  Oh, my God.  You're killing me.  You're killing today, man.  You're freaking killing.  Wandered out of an Oscar Mayer.  This is WNEW, and this is Otto and George, and you're listening to Olteny and Anthony, 
[03:15:30]  and that's too much f***ing information for one f***ing thing.  Have you been to askoj.com?  Yeah.  You were checking it out before the show today.  No, no.  Yeah.  askoj.com.  This is great.  It's not up yet.  It's up, but it's not up.  All the buttons aren't working.  Bezzy, what's that website about?  Well, ask O.J. 
[03:16:00]  Hey.  Rude, rude.  We're going to have the publisher of this website on our show tonight.  Actually, O.J.  Hi, O.J.  How about some butt sticks?  Hey.  Rude, rude.  Hey, Rude.  Ask O.J.  Can I say something?  Yes.  I'm really getting it to Ron and Pez.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Well.  Hey, and we're getting it to you.  Take it however you like, but those guys are doing a very good job at night on this fine 
[03:16:30]  radio station of ours.  Yes.  They really are.  They're keeping me entertained.  Hey.  I have a girlfriend and a fiancé in Canada.  You hear that one?  Yeah.  That he starts doing?  Yeah.  And I'm like, yeah, what's his name, Fezzy?  Hey.  It's pretty funny, man.  Hey, where'd you get that?  Hey.  Shut up. 
[03:17:00]  I have a fiancé.  I have a fiancé in Canada.  I swear.  If you haven't checked them out yet, they're doing a great job.  When are they on?  I don't even know.  No.  You are gay.  It's 11, right?  It's 11.  I would choke the chickens, whatever.  You idiots.  Hey.  Cut it out.  Cousa.  What's that?  Anyway.  Vagina.  What's that?  Butt's sake.  Oh, okay. 
[03:17:30]  Penises.  Yeah, okay.  So, Fezzy.  Yes?  AskOJ.com.  Ask OJ.  I think he's getting a bad rap.  Goddamn.  Yeah, Ask OJ.  It's a whole thing.  One of the greatest football players to ever play the game.  That's how he's built here on the website. 
[03:18:00]  Not murderer.  Also centered in one of the most profound trials of American legal history.  Still, involving him in the trial, but not saying he killed two people.  If you have questions, he's ready to answer them.  And then they have a little did you know section.  Which, strangely, doesn't have...  It's got OJ was awarded the Heisman Trophy, leading rusher, first player to ever rush over 
[03:18:30]  2,000 yards in a single season.  OJ inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 85.  Did you know that, Opie?  Yes, I did, Anthony.  Well, that's written right down here on the website.  I guess they ran out of room for killed two people.  Did you know OJ killed two people and then flew to Chicago and made like he didn't and blamed it on the police?  Yes, but it seems he's going to have a live chat on askoj.com. 
[03:19:00]  But it's going to cost you 20 bucks to get in to ask him questions.  He's selling personalized autographs of NFL memorabilia signed by OJ just for you.  Would you give this guy a dime?  People will do it.  Pay 20 bucks so you could say...  Okay, here it is.  OJ, did you kill Ron and Nicole? 
[03:19:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  That was well worth the 20 bucks right there.  You've got to think I got my money's worth on that one.  You've got to think.  If you think about it, really.  Really.  Poor OJ.  Poor, poor OJ.  He's just scorned.  Let me hit one of these buttons.  No, no, it's under construction.  This site is under construction. 
[03:20:00]  If I get a hold of my webmaster, I'm going to cut his throat.  This should be up.  I've got to make money.  Free event notification.  Would you like to be notified of upcoming OJ events?  Please enter your email address.  I entered mine.  I want to be updated.  I will be murdering my next blonde hose bag.  If you would like to watch on askOJ.com, leave your email address. 
[03:20:30]  Did I mention I almost cut the bitch's head off?  We just forget too quickly, you know?  I think we do.  We really forget.  I don't know.  I think people hate him.  Yeah?  I think the tides have changed on him.  Download the OJ Escape from Los Angeles game.  Waka, waka, waka.  You control the white bronco on this website as Al Cowling drives, and I try to get away  with my gathering up cash and passport points. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, I have a gun.  Oh, no.  The damn news cop just spotted me.  I have to change my route like I was going to my mama's house.  We are presently looking for OJ Simpson.  Remember that one?  The guy's holding the press conference?  Yeah.  OJ, we're supposed to surrender.  We are presently looking for OJ Simpson. 
[03:21:30]  Okay.  Look at that.  I ran over a Robert Kardashian stashed the murder weapon in a golf bag power pill.  That ought to make me last longer.  Jump the wall and chip golf balls.  While you don't acknowledge your own blood on the driveway.  Uh-oh.  That's bad.  I seem to have dropped some DNA in front of the murder site. 
[03:22:00]  It doesn't matter.  For some god-known reason.  It just doesn't matter.  Oh.  The glove does not fit.  You must acquit.  AskOJ.com.  And, Anthony, you have something else on the AskOJ.com website?  AskOJ.  Yeah, it seems there's a little video clip that he explains what this website's about  and what this live chat is going to be about 
[03:22:30]  that this is going to cost people 20 bucks to get in and ask OJ questions.  So, no further ado.  Here's OJ.  Hello.  I'm OJ Simpson.  I've been invited by PublicCrossing.com to be the subject of their first live webcast.  You'll be able to talk to me and hear me live on the internet, uninterrupted, unedited.  It's something I've been looking forward to for a long time.  Now, when you type your questions in, please keep me sure they're concise  because I want to answer as many as I possibly can.  Incidentally, with the exception of my young kids, there's no subject that's off-limits. 
[03:23:00]  Any one of my trials, what's going on in my life today,  and even my theories of what happened on June 12th.  And for those of you who are concerned, I'm not getting paid a dollar for this.  I'm doing it because since she was mad, I didn't want to go one-on-one with you.  That is so lame.  You know, time has just made everything fade, and it's a damn shame. 
[03:23:30]  Do you remember the testimony?  Do you remember watching it?  Do you remember the limo driver?  It was the best TV ever, Anthony.  Do you remember the limo driver who saw O.J.?  That just sat out in his limo by the gate,  and he was supposed to pick up O.J. to take him to the airport,  and he's just like, hello?  O.J.? O.J.?  Is this intercom work?  O.J.?  The limo's here, O.J.? 
[03:24:00]  O.J.?  I guess I'll just sit in the limo and wait a little longer.  Yeah, 20 minutes later.  O.J.?  O.J.?  Let me ring the bell.  Uh, hello, O.J.?  Hello?  Oh, wait, look at that.  It looks like O.J. dressed in black going into the house.  O.J.?  O.J., I see you.  O.J.? 
[03:24:30]  O.J.?  I see you.  You're in black.  You just came by the side of the house.  Now you're going in the front door.  O.J.?  All right, I guess I'll just wait a little longer.  A little longer, yeah.  Hello, O.J.?  O.J.?  Let me try the bell again.  Hello?  O.J.?  O.J., look, I know you're in there.  I saw you come into the house dressed all in black.  Hello?  O.J.?  O.J.?  O.J.?  Try the horn again. 
[03:25:00]  O.J.?  O.J.?  And finally the door opens.  Hello, hi.  How are you doing?  I was chipping golf balls.  Right.  O.J., no, I saw you.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  I was sleeping and then chipping golf balls.  And I cut my finger.  How did I cut my finger?  Chipping golf ball.  I was taking a shower because I had a lot of blood dirt on me.  O.J., I saw you go.  No, no, no.  Remember that?  The guy, the limo driver saw O.J. dressed in black go into the house. 
[03:25:30]  And they found a blood trail the exact place he said he was walking.  Ponderous effing ponderous.  No, no.  And I like how O.J. says that.  Do we have that potted up again?  Yes.  The computer.  Any one of my trials, what's going on in my life today, and even my theories of what happened on June 12th.  My theory, I swear, it was a flying saucer. 
[03:26:00]  I want Mulder and Scully to investigate because I know that aliens don't like sunglasses.  Dan from Yonkers, O.J.'s theories are almost as good as Spaz's science theory.  It's just insane.  The same thing.  Along with my theories on what happened.  See, I believe that the aliens came down out of a black hole.  O.J., do you believe that whales have sex with submarines as well?  Yeah, they got us.  We must stop the sonar.  You could question me on sonar and deflector shields and giant mosquitoes that chopped up my wife and Ron Goldman. 
[03:26:30]  It was a giant mosquito with encephalitis.  But I want to add also, she was going to die anyway from cancer because she was joining the Yankees.  What a friggin' moron.  Does anyone remember?  Please, say that you remember how shocked you were when they said not guilty.  I know it's six years later, but you need to join me to clone spiders and sheep. 
[03:27:00]  To better protect my future girls from my knife-wielding.  You remember his car outside with blood on it?  Oh, brother.  He had no alibi for where he was.  I got McDonald's with Cato, and I had to borrow a 20 from him. 
[03:27:30]  Remember that?  But then I dropped him off.  He went to eat, and I went to go kill Ron and Nicole.  Oh, I mean, I went to chip golf balls and take a shower and take a nap.  Yeah, that's where I was.  That's the limo driver.  Okay.  Okay, come on.  I've been out of here 20 minutes.  I know you're in there.  I saw you dressed in black.  You're in a black, like, jogging suit, and you went inside. 
[03:28:00]  Why didn't you come over here?  It's the car, OJ.  No, no, no.  And I was so upset by the news of her death, I cut my finger.  Coincidentally, in the same place I cut when I was cutting her throat open.  Damn OJ.  Please, let's not forget.  20 bucks.  OJ should have called Spaz beforehand to help him plan the perfect murder.  See, he didn't cut a symmetricized cut on her throat. 
[03:28:30]  But because the cops found his wife dead and blood leading into his yard and jumped the  locked gate.  Whoa, that negates everything.  That's tampered with the scene.  They found my blood and jumped it somewhere.  I don't know how they got so much of my blood and her blood and everyone else's.  And shoe prints from my Bruno Mali killing shoes.  And my club, which doesn't fit. 
[03:29:00]  I have arthritis.  AskOJ.com.  He's got sports scores up there like he never killed two people.  I know.  It's a website from somebody you'd never know killed two people.  There's no reference to it whatsoever.  No.  Just that he was in like the most profound trial in American legal history.  Like he was the victim.  Yeah.  It almost makes it sound like he was this victim and he got off.  He got his just desserts. 
[03:29:30]  Ask OJ's little picture of the face.  Ask me.  I'll slit your effing throat.  It could be a website from anybody.  But no, he killed people.  Let's see.  The Cods.  Wadsworth undergoes knee surgery.  Out six to eight years.  He's got the sports news.  Yeah.  That's it.  OJ killed two people.  That's hilarious. 
[03:30:00]  All right.  Yeah, we have to take a break.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Hey, this is Sandy.  Syndication when Opie puts a ring on my finger.  My wife is not born yet.  1027-WNEW. </pre>
