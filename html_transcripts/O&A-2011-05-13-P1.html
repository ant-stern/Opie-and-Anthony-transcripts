<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious rant about a disgustingly filthy Target bathroom stall, featuring a "toilet paper nest" six inches high.  The hosts lambasted the photo-sharing service "Lockers" for obscuring the image with a Green Hornet advertisement, advocating for listeners to switch providers. This segued into a broader discussion on the appalling state of public restrooms, filled with anecdotes about their own experiences with urine, feces, and even boogers.  The use of toilet seat covers was also debated, with at least one host expressing strong disapproval.  A recurring segment focused on chain emails forwarded by their older relatives, highlighting the absurd political jokes, conspiracy theories, and often false statistics contained within, showcasing the generational gap in internet literacy.  Listeners called in to share their own public restroom horror stories and contribute to the chain email discussion.  The hosts mentioned upcoming guests Jim Jeffries and Kurt Metzger.  Earlier in the show, they also previewed the appearance of Ian Halperin and his "goddesses," along with Jim Norton.


The show then transitioned to a discussion of Roger Waters and David Gilmour's surprise Pink Floyd reunion performance of "Comfortably Numb," speculating about the motivations behind it, particularly financial gain. This led to a graphic discussion of the hosts' severe allergies, followed by a humorous, morbid tangent about cavemen's hardships. A listener, Cassius, called in to discuss the potential downsides of LASIK surgery, prompting a lengthy discussion of the hosts' own experiences and the death of a doctor who had performed the procedure for them.  Kathy Griffin's negative LASIK experience was also brought up. A news report about a mother giving her eight-year-old daughter Botox sparked outrage and a segment dedicated to sensationalized "news teases," with listeners encouraged to submit examples. Several examples were discussed, covering topics like sex offenders, cancer, and the supposed link between houses and weight gain.  The show concluded this segment with further discussion of news teases, the state of modern FM radio, the death of Osama Bin Laden (and the lack of released photos), and an anecdote about a bizarre New York City scene.  Jim Jeffries and Kurt Metzger were again mentioned as upcoming guests, with anticipation of a potentially explosive interaction with Ian Halperin and his "goddesses."


The next segment started with a discussion about viral videos, contrasting mundane content with videos featuring nudity and racial slurs. The hosts then described videos they had filmed of young magicians who had been guests the previous day, focusing on the video quality and the magicians' performances. One female magician was noted as being extremely attractive, but her acting was criticized. This transitioned into a discussion about acquiring helmet cameras to record altercations with cab drivers, comparing GoPro and Canon models.  The topic shifted to audio quality for podcasting while biking, and then to an awkward past interview with Justin Bartha on Ron and Fez's show, with audio clips played highlighting Bartha's perceived unfriendly behavior.  The hosts speculated about the reasons for Bartha's attitude.  A brief discussion about the controversies surrounding Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend and child pornography followed, leading into a discussion of age of consent laws and an offensive anecdote from one of the hosts.  The segment concluded with the hosts expressing frustration over their lack of raises and respect from management, hinting at potential future changes in their broadcasting situation.  They also discussed Eastside Dave and his online videos, and a tangent on the popularity of Fonzie from *Happy Days*.


The show continued with a further discussion about *Happy Days*, its evolution, and the character of Fonzie. This led to a discussion about aging and sexual preferences, including jokes about the lack of old-lady porn. Kurt Metzger joined the show in studio, mentioning his work at Caroline's Comedy Club. Ian Halperin then arrived with two women he called his "goddesses," promoting a film about Charlie Sheen. He detailed his "undercover" methods of gathering information, implying access to details of Sheen's personal life and drug use.  This segment was heavily laden with crude and sexually explicit jokes and comments from all participants, including aggressive insults and offensive remarks. Halperin's prediction about the Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver divorce was also discussed.


Finally, a segment with Ian Halperin ("His Highness") featured a highly provocative and sexually charged conversation involving vulgar language and descriptions of sexual acts.  The conversation involved Halperin's sexual exploits and relationships with the women,  and speculation about the sexual preferences of others, including Shaquille O'Neal.  Numerous crude jokes and sexual innuendos were present throughout. Halperin promoted his film, "Charlie Sheen: Hollywood Black Book," and the conversation touched on Ashton Kutcher replacing Charlie Sheen on "Two and a Half Men," and a discussion about race and racism (with apologies offered for offensive language). A caller added to the vulgar and sexually explicit nature of the conversation. The segment ended with the guests singing "Love Train," and Halperin breaking a microphone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just, like, hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, good morning. Welcome to the...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, see, their service just sucks a dick.  Oh, now, come on. We work here.  There's no way you should be saying that about...  Oh, oh, the photo service.  Yeah, uh...  Wow.  What service was this? 
[00:01:30]  Which photo thing are you using?  It's the photo service you use for Twitter.  You have quite the selection.  And some of them really suck the high, hard one.  Uh, somebody...  Somebody's...  The one service I was using switched over to lockers.  L-O-C-K-E-R-Z.  Yeah.  I'm putting them on notice.  Ooh, that's a bad one.  I'm dropping them, and I strongly suggest a lot of our listeners drop them.  Because I was just quickly going to show you a picture of a nice toilet nest. 
[00:02:00]  Yes, I saw that, by the way.  Oh, you saw it yesterday?  Yeah.  Toilet nest.  And, uh...  And there's a huge ad for the Green Hornet covering the picture.  Yeah, what?  It was bad enough when you get a little advertising in the corner here and there.  Yeah.  Now it's to the point...  Do they really think this shit's going to fly with people in the year 2011?  They're just going to...  Everyone's going to get the fuck away from lockers if this is what you're going to do.  Unless it all gets pop-ups on it, like every single one of the photo servers. 
[00:02:30]  And then we're just screwed.  Well, of course.  And eventually that will happen because, you know...  And why are they advertising the Green Hornet?  The movie's doing that badly?  How...  When did that come out?  Oh, maybe on DVD now?  Is that what the...  Yeah, it's probably on the...  So then I have to skip...  On the DVD.  Then I have to skip the ad, then you finally see the toilet nest that I...  That's disgusting.  By the way, people are wondering if it was in a Target.  Yes, I was in a Target yesterday.  You had to take a shit in a Target?  I didn't do that. 
[00:03:00]  Literally?  No, I didn't think you did that.  Oh, okay.  All right, yeah.  But you had to take a shit in a Target, though?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The bathroom was actually really clean except for this one stall.  That's what was so bizarre.  That's a wreck.  Like, people are just piling up toilet paper on top of other people's toilet paper, making  this massive toilet paper nest.  Is that what that is, though?  It's massive, because...  Dude, my picture doesn't do it justice, because the toilet paper, you know, blends in with  the toilet seat, because it's all white.  The back here, that's six inches high. 
[00:03:30]  I'm not even joking.  But now, if you were...  Six inches of toilet paper in the back.  But if you're so afraid of the germs and everything that you put the toilet paper on there so your  ass doesn't hit the seat, wouldn't you be afraid of the toilet paper?  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.  From someone else?  That's what I'm saying.  Then they're adding toilet paper on top of the toilet paper.  Yeah, but why wouldn't you kick it into the toilet, flush it, and start anew?  That's why I took this picture.  This is bizarre.  I mean, it makes no sense.  We've all seen, you know, toilet-ness in our lifetime. 
[00:04:00]  But this one was...  I'm calling it the greatest one ever.  And I guess that's why Lockers has to fucking, you know, have a green Hornet head over my  picture.  How do these germy people, like, leave something like that?  Like, they're so...  Why would you leave it like that if you're so germy?  I don't know.  And what's really strange, there were three stalls, right?  Yeah.  The other two stalls were pristine.  I'm going to use the word pristine today.  Pristine.  Really nice.  So that's the...  So why... 
[00:04:30]  Disgusting stall.  Why did someone insist they got to keep piling toilet paper up on the nest and use this  stall instead of the other two that were fine, plus the fact that there was no one really  in Target to begin with yesterday?  Did they leave a log in there, too?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it's just...  Yeah, a lot of people thought that was my log.  That is fucking disgusting.  Yeah.  I guess when you blow up the picture, you can see that the back of the toilet seat is pretty  damn high with toilet paper.  Dude, I...  This is bizarre.  I honestly have to believe that's one crazy person. 
[00:05:00]  You think?  Yeah, yeah, I have to.  It's got to be like...  It's got to be OCD, right?  One crazy person just going nuts with a shitload of toilet paper.  We live among animals.  That's crazy.  That is like something you'd come by in the forest.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just, ah, look, we've tracked down where he shits.  But...  Yeah, I didn't know you saw the picture, so I was popping it up and then this lockers...  I forgot what it was, because I don't pay attention to these picture sites.  Yeah.  But they switched over to...  Lockers was Plexi. 
[00:05:30]  Plexi, okay.  Well, lockers sucks a fucking dick, and I'm moving on, and I really hope a lot of the  listeners move on.  Yeah.  And then if we go to YFROG or fucking Moby or something else, and they start this shit,  then we'll move on again.  Yeah.  Because you can't have a full ad over your pictures like that.  Like I said, it was bad enough when they were kind of in the corner and stuff, but you  could deal with that.  Yeah, now you can't even see any of the picture until you click through their ad.  Right.  Ah, pain in the ass.  Yeah, I knew. 
[00:06:00]  I just knew that it was too good to be true with just Twitter and what, MySpace fucked  it all up, right?  Yeah, once they find a way to monetize it...  So they'll fuck up Facebook, they'll fuck up Twitter.  But the good thing is, new shit comes along.  I'm hoping.  Like once people get pissed off at the way things work, like fucking, you know, all the ads  and spam and bullshit, move on.  Can we all take dumps in one toilet today, and then that's going to be my last picture  that appears on lockers.  I'm going to go, this is what I think of your shitty service. 
[00:06:30]  Click here.  Can we do that, Danny?  Can we like put yellow tape up around one fucking stall?  Just shit in here.  We all want to shit in one toilet bowl, and that's going to be my last picture on lockers.  I took mine in the hotel room, so I'm empty.  You're good?  I'm all empty.  Do you wake up and shit?  Sometimes.  Yeah?  Sometimes.  It's weird.  It's either right before or right after the show.  But after the show, I have to go home, so, you know, after I get home.  You don't like shitting in public? 
[00:07:00]  No, it's not one of those phobias, though.  I don't blame you after you see this.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of people thought this was in Sirius.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.  I've seen Sirius bathroom.  We get toilet nests in Sirius, but nothing like this.  In Sirius, we have the pleasure of working with animals that like to fucking pee all over the seat and on the walls at times and on the floor.  Yeah.  This is the fucking animals that work among us here.  I don't understand the disgust.  This is a pretty nice corporate environment. 
[00:07:30]  You know, we have our issues, obviously, but in general, it's a nice place to work.  You don't expect urine on your fucking toilet seat.  Piss.  Shit left in the toilet.  I don't understand.  There's not a public toilet around that you can't flush with your foot.  Mm-hmm.  So if you have this phobia of touching the flush knob, which, obviously, you know, you don't want to touch that fucking thing.  Yeah.  Use your foot.  Yeah.  Smash that thing and go down.  Who fucking takes a shit, wipes, then gets up and leaves and just fucking leaves it there? 
[00:08:00]  I can't fathom that.  And just so you know, because people will beat me up, I'm the type of guy, when I was taking the Long Island Railroad, right into one of those bathrooms without toilet paper, I would sit my ass right the fuck down.  Oh, yeah.  Right on the graffiti-ridden fucking toilet seat.  So I'm not shy when it comes to fucking germs.  Trust me.  But when it gets to this point and actual urine and feces that is outside the toilet bowl, who are these people we work with? 
[00:08:30]  Just fucking flush.  Even if the nest is left there, it's like, all right, there's a shitload of toilet paper, you're a fucking freak.  Yeah.  But, like, to just leave your dump in the bowl.  How about just sit on the toilet bowl?  Like, what's wrong with you?  Yeah, exactly.  That's another thing.  I don't make the nest.  I don't like to just sit down.  Like, I can't just rush in and, you know, sit down because that's like, because, look, people piss all over the seat.  I just don't feel like sitting on someone else's piss.  Exactly.  So I'll wipe the seat down.  Right.  But that's the extent of my cleanliness in the bathroom.  Like I said, man, I've sat on graffiti fucking toilet seats. 
[00:09:00]  No problem.  No fucking problem.  Because when you pull that toilet cover down, and then you put it down, you feel like, no offense to the women out there, but you feel like a broad.  Like a bitch.  Yeah, you just feel like a bitch.  Like you're sitting on some kind of maxi pad or something.  I've never even, like, pretended that I was going to use one of those things.  Yeah.  And, like, I think the only reason I might have taken one out of its little cardboard holder is to, like, blow my nose because I feel it's funny or whatever.  I don't know.  But I've never, I've never for once considered using that.  And, you know, the center is removed and it falls into the water. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, there's a whole gimmick.  Yeah.  It falls into the water, but it's hanging there.  And then, let's get really gross.  The dump begins and you hear your dump hitting the tissue paper.  You feel like such a bitch.  Like a bitch.  That's supposed to automatically suck it down when you flush the toilet.  Yeah.  So I, you know.  Oh, really?  See, I don't even know.  Yeah, yeah.  You're supposed to rip it off or something.  No, it's supposed to dangle into the toilet water a little bit so that when you're done and you flush, the water grabs it and pulls it right off of the fucking thing. 
[00:10:00]  And so you don't end up with a giant nest of those fucking things.  It's an engineering marvel.  Oh, who thought of that?  It's like, we can't have this thing because there'll be 20 of them just sitting on a toilet seat.  What do we do?  How it's made.  Yeah.  Let me see if I can go back to the picture now.  Let me see if I can go back to the picture now without a pop-up ad.  Without an ad?  Oh, boy.  Did I deal with their stupid pop-up ad?  Yeah, you would think if you dealt with it once.  They fucked with the wrong person, man.  We have influence here, and I'm highly recommending that we find another picture service. 
[00:10:30]  Well, you know what I've got to tell you, though?  I've clicked through twice already, like on an actual PC web browser, and I'm not getting any ads.  Well, on the fucking iPad, the Green Hornet ad popped up.  Oh, shit.  Is it an iPad issue?  I don't fucking know.  No, it happens on phones, too.  So maybe not on the PC.  I don't know.  I don't think it happens as much on my MacBook.  Damn.  So, whatever.  That's fucking disgusting.  And I was saying earlier, I'm not a germaphobe where I won't take a dump in a public toilet. 
[00:11:00]  I've left plenty of logs in public toilets.  But I'm just more comfy at home.  Yeah.  You know?  Especially if you're going to have one where you've got to take a little time.  You're going to be sitting there a little while, scrolling through some tweets, things like that.  I like being home.  In the comfort of your home.  Oh, it's so nice.  Uh, let's say hi to Steve in New Hampshire.  Steve.  Yes.  Oh, wait. 
[00:11:30]  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  One of the things that fucking sucks about lockers is that you can't save the image onto your phone.  At least not on the Android.  But if you do download it, and you try to open it, it thinks that it's a fucking Atari game.  Well, all right.  So we're done.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  What do you use?  WideFrog?  I don't even know, to tell you the truth.  I switch it up every so often, but I think I am WideFrog, yeah.  I think you're WideFrog.  I'm going WideFrog or Moby.  Fuck lockers.  Fuck their assholes. 
[00:12:00]  Where do they come up with these names?  Yeah, Plexi.  What's the WideFrog?  Plexi sells their service to these fucking cunts.  They made their money.  God, I'm fucking frustrated with this.  On your aggravation, they're making their money.  Yeah, but you could collect points, and that could...  Shut up.  Your ad is covering up the picture.  I want to look at a fucking picture, not play a game.  Yeah, exactly.  Figure out a fucking gimmick.  Rich in New Hampshire.  Rich.  Hey there, Rich.  Hey, man.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Now, when you take a large deuce, okay, it's like a sense of pride and accomplishment. 
[00:12:30]  We want it to stay there for as long as it possibly can.  So, you're saying when people leave it in the bowl, and you walk in there, and there's  a big turd in the toilet, it's because he's so proud of it.  Nah, it's an animal marking their territory.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Yes, because we all have cell phones.  So, you know, when you do get a good one, of course we take a picture of it, and of course  we have to share among our friends.  But that is a sign of aggression, leaving your shit. 
[00:13:00]  It is some kind of a weird serial killer thing, like where they pose the victim.  They pose their fucking shit.  And they're posing the victim for shock value for the person that finds it.  Nice.  It's like CSI.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Yeah, Mike.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  You know what's disgusting also is when you go take a piss and there's a fucking shitload  of boogers on the wall.  Oh, God.  There's just boogers everywhere. 
[00:13:30]  We get the boogers on the wall here, too.  We do get the boogers on the wall.  And here's the irony of that whole thing.  There's toilet paper right the fuck there.  It's right next to you when you're on the bowl.  There's no reason to swipe it on the wall of the stall.  And if you're at the urinal, there's toilet paper right behind you in the stalls.  So grab a fucking handful of that and wipe your snot in it.  Or just flick it into the fucking urinal.  Or in the urinal.  Well, there you go, if you want to, you know. 
[00:14:00]  They'll melt.  They'll melt.  Whatever they do.  They'll hang in on the fucking little mint on the bottom of the urinal.  And once again, man, just so you know, the type of guy I am, when I used to do spring  break, the elbow room down there in Fort Lauderdale, I went down there once and the lights were  out in the men's room.  Oh, sexy.  And there was a line.  It didn't stop anybody.  And you walk in and the floor was really wet.  And because it's spring break, we're all just wearing whatever fucking flip flops and shit. 
[00:14:30]  And you feel the moisture and you realize the moisture is urine because no one can find  where to pee.  Yeah.  Because there was like a fucking, what is it called there?  A trough.  A trough.  You can't use the...  So people would just go in there, assume no one was close and just start peeing on the  floor.  And you can't use the sonar that you use in the toilet water when you could hear it.  Exactly.  It's like, okay, I'm on target.  But doesn't it scare you when you're using the sonar to take a leak in the dark and you  hear it and then you start hearing nothing slowly and you're like, which way am I turning? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Which way do I go?  Do I go south or north?  I don't know which way to go to get the sound back.  So I'm not shy.  But when you see someone else's booger in front of you as you take a leak, fucking gross.  It's just disgusting.  And that's probably another reason, again, not for the germ's sake, but just the disgust  sake.  It's nicer to go at home.  This guy carries a bottle of Clorox with him to clean the seat before he shits.  That's crazy.  Jeremy, this is...  You don't need that.  Jeremy is shitting.  Are you just trying to get on the air today, Jeremy? 
[00:15:30]  No, I'm dead serious, man.  Because your sports teams suck.  I have a phobia with public bathrooms.  So I carry a bottle of Clorox bleach and a spray bottle and some wipes.  And boom, I can take a shit wherever I want.  Where do you carry that?  In your man purse?  Where do you fucking carry...  Exactly.  I have a gigantic nap sack that I carry around.  Oh, you take naps?  No.  That's called a backpack.  It's called a backpack.  Another good thing to do with the bleach, you want to spray a little bikers with a spandex.  My napsack.  We don't...  You know what a spandex that them bikers wear that ride at 10 speeds? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hot.  And if you spray them with that bleach, it will disintegrate whatever that is off of them.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  Clorox.  I don't know about that.  That's getting carried away.  Wife went to the...  This is nice.  Look at this.  Mike and Howard Beach.  Go ahead, Mike.  Yeah.  Good morning, guys.  Hello.  Listen, my wife works in a school.  She's a teacher, and she went to the women's bathroom, and the teachers were in a lounge.  And the last person that used the bowl in there, they left a log in the bowl, and the best thing was, there was no toilet paper in it. 
[00:16:30]  Maybe they used the rest of the toilet...  Oh, I see what you're saying, because the toilet paper would be in the bowl.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah, there was a fucking problem there.  Someone's walking around with swamp ass.  Oh, God.  Even though the phones are lit, this is the last call we're going to take, because I don't think anyone's going to beat this today.  Hey, Tom in New Hampshire, go ahead, Tom.  Morning, boys.  Morning, Tom.  Hey, I used to work in a place up in New Hampshire right down the street from the state prison. 
[00:17:00]  So they hired all the halfway house folk, you know, paying $30 an hour to come in and do the, you know, menial labor.  Yeah.  They used to go in the men's room, take a shit, dip their finger in it, and write graffiti on the wall.  Inhuman shit.  I completely buy this.  I believe it.  Oh, yeah, that sounds like something prison.  I believe this one.  You could actually see the little trails of, like, the pads of the fingerprint in this shit.  I used to go next door when I had to use the bathroom and use the bathroom next door. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I've, you know, I've shit in some places, you know, the famous beach shit and all that.  That's disgusting.  You know, that's just way too much.  Get a finger in it and just start fucking.  Way too much.  Working your art.  Yeah.  Work your art.  We don't have to continue this, especially after that phone call.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  And the other thing I was showing at just before the show, and I'm bringing this up  because I think all of us can relate to this, we all have older family members that have 
[00:18:00]  discovered the internet.  Yes.  They have discovered the internet, everyone.  How long have we been using the internet?  Oh, my God, since.  I started at BAB.  That goes back to, I'm answering the question I asked you.  I'm sorry.  How long?  You go way back, actually.  Way back to, yeah, 300 baud modem.  So I'm talking like the late 80s, I guess.  Late 80s.  Wow.  Okay.  So, yeah, we've been doing the internet more or less 20 years, right? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  That's about right.  Some maybe 15 years ago.  Yeah.  By 15 years ago, most people were starting to, you know, look at this internet thing.  But we have older fucking family members that have discovered recently the internet.  So they're sending shit that we all sent 10 years ago.  Oh, my God.  They are just discovering this stuff.  All those cute jokes and why chocolate is better than fucking men or whatever the fuck 
[00:19:00]  that one is.  It's what used to be sent around on mimeographs.  Right.  And Xeroxed.  They used to Xerox these comical things and pass them around the office.  And you'd pin them up in your little cubicle.  Yeah.  And now they get to pass them around with phones and computers.  Yeah.  Well, the first thing, I have an uncle that is a hard...  Always an uncle, by the way. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  He's a hardcore Republican.  Mm-hmm.  So he likes to send chain emails to the entire family about how bad Obama is.  Right.  And I want to write the fucking guy and go, look, idiot.  We have a huge family.  I don't even know how many cousins I have on one side.  It's got to be, if I had to guess, at least 30.  Yeah.  And we have a huge fucking family.  And this guy, I guess, is just assuming that everyone's a Republican and hates Obama  in our family.  Yeah, yeah.  The odds are that's not possible.  But he just assumes that, well, you're huge. 
[00:20:00]  You've got to be a Republican and you've got to hate Obama.  It's usually the Republicans and conservatives that send those things around.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I very rarely see them from liberals, which, I don't know, it might be a good tactic  Most of them that I've read from my uncle and other sources are fake.  Like, you read them, and believe me, I'm no fan of Obama.  I don't think I really have to tell the audience that.  But when you get one of those things, it's like, in 1998, Obama vowed to kill every white 
[00:20:30]  baby born.  Here's the proof.  And I'm like, I look on Snopes and it's like, well, it says here he never vowed that.  You were hoping it was true, weren't you?  I was hoping it was true, but you find out he never vowed that.  And you look at it, and then you try to send a thing back to everybody and go, look, I  checked Snopes, here's the link.  And you never hear about it again until the next one comes that, again, is equally as  false.  Sure.  And, you know, safe to say I'm not a Republican.  My dad was a big-time Republican. 
[00:21:00]  I think most of my brothers are Republicans.  I'm really just kind of in the middle.  If I had to say, I'd probably lean more Democrat if you really give a fuck about.  But I don't care enough to really, like, fight on either side.  But anyway, so he sends this shit, assuming we're all Republicans to begin with, which  is horse shit.  You want me to read the one he sent today before I get to the other one?  He sent two.  Two today?  Boy, he is enjoying this, isn't he?  And it's one of those chain emails that go on forever where you don't even know what 
[00:21:30]  it's about yet because of all the forwards and the CCs, and then you think, okay, it'll  finally start here, and nope, it's a whole bunch of other forwards and CCs because it  came from somewhere else, and you'll eventually get to what the fuck this thing's about.  And then you think it's a tiny little thing, and you get to the bottom of that, and then  what is this thing called on the right?  It goes back up to the top, meaning there's more shit to read.  More shit to read.  That's the more shit to read thingy on your fucking phone.  Another thing I don't like about that is you look at all the people that this is forwarded 
[00:22:00]  to and came from, and now they have your email address.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Because you get a whole fucking page of people it went to and came from, and now they're  like, oh, wait, look, I got Opie's email address.  I don't really have an email address.  I don't even know these people.  And my voicemail's not set up.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm becoming really strange.  You're off the grid?  Sort of.  You want to get off the grid?  I mean, as much as I tweet and all that, you really can't get a hold of me. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  I have a corporate email I don't even check anymore.  I wouldn't.  I wouldn't use that.  Because I moved on to my Atrix.  I've never used the corporate email.  I kind of take a peek at it every morning, make sure the company didn't blow up.  And I guess family members try to use that, but I don't really read all my emails anymore.  And people are really frustrated because I haven't set up the voicemail on my new phone.  So it just rings.  And then I get to see who called me.  And they don't get to leave messages.  They don't get to leave messages.  It's fucking perfect.  So anyway, this is one that came in from an older family member. 
[00:23:00]  Did you see the Diane Sawyer special report?  They remove all items from a typical middle class family's home that were not made in the USA.  There was hardly anything left besides the kitchen sink, literally.  During the special, they're going to show truckloads of items USA made being brought in to replace everything.  And we'll be talking about how to find these items and the difference in price, etc.  And then it just goes on and on and on and on. 
[00:23:30]  It's pages.  And on.  Look at this.  And on and on.  Oh, my God.  It would take me 20 minutes to read this.  And on.  Plastic eggs to celebrate Easter.  Made in China.  Yeah, because they're made in China.  So you better not get the plastic eggs.  And then you think you're at the bottom.  Look, the cursor goes back up.  Whoop.  More.  And then it says, pass it on, America.  Pass it on.  America.  Pass it on, America. 
[00:24:00]  There are certain.  Send this to everybody you know.  Now, the only reason I bring this up, this is shit that we all dealt with when we first got into the Internet.  My point is that the old people are way the fuck behind and still sending this shit out to everybody.  There are certain themes with these things, too.  There's that one, like the America, bi-American thing.  Then you ever see the one where it's like,  Last year, a young Iraqi boy walked up to a soldier and asked,  Why are you here?  The soldier said,  And it's this soliloquy of this soldier speaking so eloquently to this young Iraqi boy 
[00:24:30]  and telling him and convincing him why he's there.  And you realize it's just a made-up fucking story.  Of course.  And who doesn't know it's not fucking made up?  Someone was standing there transcribing this spontaneous conversation between a soldier and a young Iraqi boy.  Of course.  And then it finally makes its way to me and 20 other schleps on fucking line.  So, I do want to read the next paragraph. 
[00:25:00]  It was interesting that Diane said that if every American spent just $64 more than normal on USA made items this year,  it would create something like 200,000 new jobs.  Now, hold the phone.  That sounds great, obviously.  You're holding the phone.  I am holding the phone.  All right.  What's that stat now?  If you spend an extra...  $64.  $64 a year.  But obviously, see, you taught me about stats.  That means every American has to do that.  Right.  And then you get to 200,000 new jobs. 
[00:25:30]  First of all, you would be lucky if 1% of the people do that.  Yeah.  After a huge campaign.  Right.  So then it's 1% of 200,000, which would be, what, 2,000, I guess?  So, 2,000 jobs.  And what kind of job are you getting for $69?  64?  Yeah.  If the same amount of people spend that much in a year, doesn't it only figure that that's  going to be the only amount of money that goes toward the job?  It sounds great, but it has to be every American, and then you get to 200,000 new jobs. 
[00:26:00]  Do the math.  That's impossible.  It's impossible.  You're never getting everybody.  But then my older relative has to pipe in.  He goes, I was buying food the other day at Walmart, and on the label of some products,  it said, from China.  For example, the R family brand of Mandarin oranges says, right on the can, from China.  Mandarin?  That's China.  My relative is Andy Rooney.  I was shocked, so for a few more cents, I bought the Liberty Gold brand. 
[00:26:30]  Do you think that much when you're buying anything?  Or the doll, since it's from California.  According to that math, each job created pays $98,000 a year.  Well, yeah.  I mean, if we're talking $64 times the population of the United States, which is 307 million people,  and then you divide that by 200,000 jobs, and each job, so that's the pay.  So that's $98,000.  That's a great job.  That's a good job right there. 
[00:27:00]  I'll take that.  Give me.  Somehow the companies and the government are taking their fucking taste.  Come on, guys.  Buy those oranges made in America.  I was shocked.  So, yeah, he bought the California brand, and then it goes back into the Diane Sawyer thing.  Oh, God.  Are we Americans as dumb as we appear, or is it that we just do not think while the Chinese  knowingly and intentionally export inferior and even toxic products and dangerous toys and  goods to be sold in American markets?  Look, man, when you go to the supermarket and you see Mandarin oranges that are cheaper, 
[00:27:30]  that's all you give a fuck about, because we're all trying to save a little money.  Sorry, but that's why that's never going to happen.  Yeah.  You know?  It's going to be a revolution for people to start paying more money for Mandarin oranges  just to try to do the right thing.  I'm looking at one right now.  You got one from an older relative?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got one.  I would love to call this guy out, because he's got a download.  This guy loves sending these around to the entire family. 
[00:28:00]  I've got so many of these.  What's going on?  Let's see.  Announcing legislation to crack down.  Here's an Obama one.  These are pages and pages.  Oh, what's this one?  The Fence.  I guess that's about immigration.  And here's everybody that's forward.  And then here's my...  See?  I got the same thing.  Let's see.  That's why I wanted to finally bring this up. 
[00:28:30]  I'm going through it.  And then it's like, you can't get any more accurate than this.  Which side of the fence?  If you've ever wondered which side of the fence you sit on, this is a great test.  If a Republican doesn't like guns, he doesn't buy one.  If a Democrat doesn't like guns, he wants all guns outlawed.  If a Republican is a vegetarian, he doesn't eat meat.  If a Democrat's a vegetarian, he wants all meat products banned.  And then, look, with that theme, it goes on and on and on. 
[00:29:00]  Is that more examples?  And then, well, I forwarded it.  How about you?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  If a Republican reads this, he'll forward it to his good friends so they can have a laugh.  A Democrat will delete it because he's offended.  Well, I forwarded it.  That's what it says.  Good for you.  It's like, I think we all get those.  Well, I got another one.  I got another one.  And look at all the forwards. 
[00:29:30]  I don't even know half these fucking people.  I recognize some relatives.  And then, who are these people?  Look at all these fucking forwards.  And then it gets to a little gasoline humor.  Ah, you know something that's topical?  Yes.  Everyone's talking about the price of gas, so you gotta give them that.  Well, you got the fuel gauge, right, in this cartoon.  A little gas humor for everybody.  Yeah.  Thanks to one of my older relatives.  This is how I need to start my day.  You know how the fuel tank, you know, goes from full to empty? 
[00:30:00]  Well, this one goes from $45, which is full, down to $0 when it's empty.  And it just shows you how much money you're losing.  As you're driving.  Right.  Instead of, you know, full and empty, half a tank.  It shows you dollar value.  The next one I don't feel like reading.  Sorry.  Because the print is tiny on my fucking phone.  It's a three-panel cartoon.  How the fuck are you supposed to read that on a smartphone?  Three-panel cartoon. 
[00:30:30]  And then the next one, I could do this one.  Police artist sketch of robbery suspect.  Would you like to see who he looks like?  Well, let me see.  It's a gas pump.  It's a gas pump.  It's robbing you.  Because we're getting robbed.  And that's the robbery suspect.  He had to send that out to everybody, I guess.  Watch out.  That's it.  He's quite the card.  On this one, I can't fucking read.  Your uncle's quite the caution.  Oh, and then this one is just a cartoon of a gas pump once again. 
[00:31:00]  And the sign on it says, spend your tax refund here.  Ah, see, you're not winning.  Gas humor, everyone.  Gas and tax humor.  And it's all in one.  And then you got a tow truck with the tow truck guy.  A little confused.  Yeah.  Befuddled, I dare say.  Oh, befuddled.  And there's a driver in his car.  Obviously, he can't fucking drive anymore.  And the tow truck's like, what the fuck?  It doesn't seem like anything's wrong with the car.  And then the driver has to say, oh, I'm not broken down.  I just thought you'd be cheaper than buying gas. 
[00:31:30]  I get it.  I get it.  Oh, gas humor.  And then you got the gas prices.  We've all seen that as you drive up to the gas station.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  On the big boards outside.  What is it, like 438 and 9 tenths, whatever the fuck it's up to now?  Well, this gas station says LOL, 9 tenths.  Oh, see?  Oh, my God, 9 tenths.  OMG.  And then premium, of course, is what the fuck, 9 tenths.  WTF, and then 9. 
[00:32:00]  Gas humor rules.  That's great.  Oh, and then you got a young couple.  You know how they get registered when they're getting married?  Well, this couple says, we're registered at Shell Mobile BP in Texaco.  Ah, that's what the wedding gift should be.  Gasoline.  I'm embarrassed to say this is one of my relatives.  Picture of the year.  Wait a minute.  What is this one?  Oh, I got to scroll.  Hold on.  I got to scroll through all the text before I get to picture of the year. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Let's see.  Which one is this?  It's the, oh, it says the new Bill of Rights, and it shows Obama with his, he's got a big  thing of the Bill of Rights up on the wall, and he's just X-ing out your rights.  Well, of course.  That's him.  Because that's what he wants to do.  Yeah.  And it says, I wanted, I voted for the old gray-headed white guy, and I got the, oh, 
[00:33:00]  don't blame me.  I voted for the old gray-headed white guy and the hottie from Alaska.  These just keep coming in.  And by the way, here's all of them that are being sent to me.  Wow.  I searched for him, and this is just one page.  Is that, is that like an uncle or an heir or somebody?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, uncle.  So it is someone from your family.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the point I'm making, because I don't get these anymore.  But because the older people, once again, the theme here, they're discovering the internet. 
[00:33:30]  This is what they feel like they need to do with this new power they got.  Oh, my God.  Here's, here's two people filling up at a gas tank, and one guy is whistling a happy tune  as he fills up his gas tank.  Now, why would he do that?  And the gas prices behind him say, regular, lots, plus, more, super, don't ask.  That's the gas prices at this gas station.  Don't even ask.  So the one guy is whistling, like, you don't give a fuck.  Why is that? 
[00:34:00]  Because he has a tiny little smart car, a little fucking hybrid or something.  Oh.  And then the guy with the big fucking Anthony Comey SUV to the right says, ah, shut up.  Because he's mad because he's got to pay so much for gas.  But, uh, Opie, you know, I'll, I'll trump you with this one right here.  You will.  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh, start your day with a little smile.  Here are some bumper stickers.  Oh, no.  That are going around.  Look, look at all the bumper stickers.  And this is, and I just want to make it clear, this is from a family member, right? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who knows that you kind of do this for a living.  Oh, yeah.  That at this point you should know what's funny and what's not.  Seen them all.  Okay.  Are you better off than you were four trillion dollars ago?  That's a good sticker.  So far this change sucks.  Uh, diversity.  It killed 13 at Fort Hood.  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  That's crazy.  Uh, you can't fix stupid, but you can vote it out.  Oh, Osama and Obama both have friends that bombed the Pentagon. 
[00:35:00]  I don't know.  I don't even know.  I don't get that.  You don't really?  No.  Osama and Obama both have friends that bombed the Pentagon.  Does that mean Obama's a Muslim?  I guess.  Is that a Muslim joke?  I don't even know what that one is.  Liberal logic.  Terrorists have rights.  Christians don't.  Mm-hmm.  Obamacare.  Freedom not included. 
[00:35:30]  And then it's got the fucking hammer and sickle of communism next to it.  Obamacare makes me sick.  The real change.  Vote out your congressman in 2010.  Well, apparently they did.  That worked.  Yes.  So, which goes to show how old this fucking thing is, too.  And they're still sending it around.  It's not even a topical.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, speaking of bumper stickers, I was just over  the Hudson River at this Target. 
[00:36:00]  Taking a shit.  Taking a shit.  Well, I took a shit in the other stall, yeah.  Ah.  But I was driving to the Target, and I get to a light, and there was a guy, and I'm trying  to think what type of car.  It was like a pickup with the fucking back shit.  Like it had like a camper shell on it or something?  And he had a sticker on the back that said, Fuck France.  And I pulled up to him, and yes, I had my HD flip, and I couldn't fucking push record. 
[00:36:30]  Because I'll admit to people, yeah, there are times I feel like I'm going to get the shit  kicked out of me so I don't go there.  And I wanted to ask the guy, Why fuck France?  And it's killing me to this fucking moment I didn't ask the guy.  Well, we all hate France.  To the point you drive around with a sticker that just says, Fuck France?  Did it look new, or was it a sticker that probably could have been around when France  was pulling those shenanigans during the-  Very good question, and you might have just answered my fucking thought process here.  Because it was a little older.  Yeah.  So I guess maybe, yeah, when the whole Freedom Fries thing was hot. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, Freedom Fries, things like that.  Maybe that's when he got his Fuck France sticker.  Yeah.  So it did look a little worn.  But man, wow.  I have a Nixon's the one sticker on my car.  Yeah, yeah, it's a little old.  People get taken aback when they see that one.  I wanted to ask this guy, but he looked like he was a fucking problem, man.  He probably would.  If you go around with a fuck anything, like just the word fuck on your car, you pretty  much don't give a shit what people see, how they feel offending anybody, things like 
[00:37:30]  that.  I was taken aback.  Yeah.  And yeah, we do some edgy shit.  It is kind of odd on the road.  It's pretty harsh.  Because you got to figure, who's going to see that?  Like, the car full of nuns.  Right.  Cops, maybe, might see it and be offended and pull you over.  Right.  You don't want to put up any red flags like that.  And then, you know, people care about the children.  Right.  So they're seeing that and have to explain now what Fuck France means.  Just Fuck France.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:38:00]  A kid learning to read.  He's like reading the stickers.  Fuck France!  Yeah, oh, no.  What did he do?  Where'd you learn that?  Bumper sticker.  I learned it from that car, okay?  One last side of gas humor.  Because if shit happens, how about that sticker?  That's a new one.  There's your gas meter in your car, right?  Ah, your little, yeah, your little gas gauge.  Gas gauge or whatever.  And, you know, part of the gasoline humor.  I can't read half of them because, like I said, the print's too small.  But this one I can read.  Why don't you take your two fingers, touch the screen, and open it up.  All right, asshole, I can do that with this phone.  Oh, oh. 
[00:38:30]  But like I told you, no one gets to email this phone.  Ah.  No email on this phone.  That one's pristine.  Yes.  Yeah, let's keep it pristine.  I keep all my stupid relatives on the phone that's not going to be around too much longer.  The shitty phone.  The shitty phone.  And, you know, it has the F for full and the E for empty.  Sure.  But then the needle is on the bottom half of the gauge.  Oh, also.  So when it says full, it shows wallet on the bottom.  Oh, so.  So your wallets are almost empty every time you're full. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  But then when you're almost empty, that means you have money.  So there's the problem.  What do you do and what do you do?  You got to fill it back up and empty your wallet.  Exactly.  It's a combo wallet gas gauge.  Exactly.  Forward that one.  Come on.  You want that one?  Yeah, yeah.  Forward that one.  That's a good one.  We could send that one around to everybody.  Oh, yeah.  We should.  I would love to know what the rest of my family thinks. 
[00:39:30]  Like, I got a forum here.  My brother just blatantly writes back, do not send these fucking things to me.  I don't give a shit.  They're bullshit.  Stop it.  I don't care about fucking politics.  Like, he gets nasty with it.  And then they just continue.  You know, I was thinking about this the other day.  A lot of people think the youth of America are passing the viruses around. 
[00:40:00]  No.  It's the old people.  They're passing the computer viruses around like motherfuckers.  And they're passing around the sexual fucking viruses.  Yeah.  Because, you know, they've discovered Viagra and all that shit.  And now they're out there divorcing their wives for 30 years and have no clue what you could get out there.  Fucking some hewa.  So don't be mistaken.  It's old people passing the viruses.  Not the young.  We know how to, you know, make sure our computers don't have viruses.  Yeah, you don't click on that fucking thing.  Old people will click on anything if it looks like something they would like. 
[00:40:30]  Like, hey, look.  Coupon.  Hey, click on this and win a free something for old people.  And they'll click on that fucking thing.  What is the EXE?  Should I click on a dot EXE?  I'll click on it.  I don't even know what it means.  But I have to get my Jitterbug phone.  She's sucking young cock out there.  That's all disease ridden. 
[00:41:00]  Don't you love when you get that email, whether it's in your email or on Facebook or whatever,  and it's just like, attention, if you get anything from me from this website, it's not me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I love getting that.  I just laugh and laugh and laugh.  Yeah, the panicked, I've been fucking hacked email.  I'm so glad I've never had to send one of those to people.  Like, hey, sorry, everyone on my contact list, my shit got hacked.  It's not me.  I got hacked and it's sent out a virus.  Don't open it.  I got one of those the other day.  It's like, you know, you know, this person has tagged you in a photo on Shopee Bag. 
[00:41:30]  Shopee Bag.  I'm like, whatever the fuck Shopee Bag is, that's nothing I want.  Who's clicking Shopee Bag?  That's great.  Shopee Bag.  That sounds horrible.  That is awesome, man.  So there you have it.  Oh, Ryan in Jersey.  Ryan.  Ryan.  I got a really good one for you guys that I got.  Gas station.  Price of regular arm.  Price of super leg. 
[00:42:00]  It's costing an arm and a leg.  You get it?  Have you seen the one with the gas pump and it's got the slot machine handle on the side?  Oh, that's good, too.  Like, yeah, look at this.  You're just going to dump money in.  You're not gambling.  No, you never get the free gas.  No, ever.  It doesn't give you gas.  I guess they're assuming that you're gambling and you always lose in the end.  So that's what's going on.  That's just dumb.  That is dumb. 
[00:42:30]  I mean, there's hacky humor and then there's just dumb.  Believe me, a lot of it is just dumb.  That's just dumb.  And fake.  Fake quotes.  Fake pictures.  You know what's going to spread around?  They were talking about that.  It's going to spread around a lot of viruses.  Is that fake Osama pictures?  The Bin Laden pictures.  Of course.  And especially if they ever do release it, there's going to be so many fake ones.  It's like, oh, here it is.  Oh, OK.  Let me click on that.  And then you're going to get, you know, the Osama Bin Laden virus. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  I believe we're going to see that shit.  Yeah.  You think some?  I totally believe it.  Some politician gave a pretty graphic description of what he saw when he looked at the picture.  You know, this came out yesterday and I meant to ask you, but we were so busy yesterday.  The guy didn't even know how a fucking, how a bullet goes into a head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As far as an exit wound and an entrance wound, I guess.  Yeah.  Is that how you say?  Yeah.  He didn't know what it was.  He didn't understand because he said he either got shot in the front of the head or the back 
[00:43:30]  of the head or near the ear, I guess.  Yeah.  He was like, did it go in his ear and come out his eye?  You heard that, right?  Or in his eye and come out his ear?  It's obviously went in his eye.  In his eye.  Because brains, he said brain matter was coming out of his eye and like drooped across his  head so it looked like part of his skull was missing.  And his quote was kind of strange, too, because he said something like the bullet went in and  then exploded, like almost as if to insinuate that it was some weird, like special Navy SEAL  bullet that like stopped in his head and then exploded. 
[00:44:00]  And then exploded.  Like a cartoon bullet?  Kind of.  But it's just a transfer of energy is what it is.  You use a certain round and if it goes in your eye, the shock wave and compression that's  happening in your head, it's probably going to come out the weakest point, which would  be the eye socket that you just put a hole in.  So the brains can fly out the entrance.  I'm just surprised a high ranking politician doesn't understand that shit. 
[00:44:30]  They don't know anything.  They really don't understand.  Politicians really don't understand shit.  I agree with you.  And a lot of them, most of the work is done by pages and interns and shit to gather information.  It's like, here, I'm going to write a bill or I'm going to study this bill, but I don't  want to read through all these thousands of pages.  You do it and give me a synopsis of the whole thing.  I don't think so.  So they're trusting like fucking the shitheads we've had in here.  The same thing with the laws. 
[00:45:00]  Every time I hear about a bill or something where they have to go through like 10,000 pages  in a day and then the next day they're signing shit.  They got to sign it and vote on it.  Are you fucking kidding?  Do you even know what's in there?  No.  And many times.  No, they don't.  I believe that.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to fucking write that and forward it to my entire family.  But now that they're showing some high-ranking politicians on both sides.  And they're talking about it.  And then it's going to spread from there a little bit.  I think they're kind of softening, what, the beaches? 
[00:45:30]  And then I think eventually we see it.  Then we see it.  And it came out today that, like we said, fucking over a week ago, that all those Navy SEALs  had cameras on their helmets.  Yeah.  The whole fucking thing was recorded.  Yeah, recorded with helmet cams.  But everyone involved had a camera rolling.  Yeah.  Everyone involved.  I'd love to see that.  Holy shit, so would I.  I did not love to see that shocked look on bin Laden's face before his eyeball pops out  standing there in his underwear, apparently.  He was shot in his underwear.  How he got in his underwear, I'll never know. 
[00:46:00]  But that's what I'm suspicious, not suspicious about.  It's not even the joke.  Yeah.  Because why not show, and I'm not going conspiracy here, I'm sorry.  I really believe we shot fucking Osama bin Laden when they said they did, which is what, about  10 days ago now, whatever it is.  Why not show a quick still of him just standing there before he got killed?  Oh, man.  Why not?  Because that's kind of ruthless.  Is that?  They'd be like, this is the last second. 
[00:46:30]  I think it's worse seeing him alive the second before he gets killed.  There's a good answer.  Then it would be, because then you're almost humanizing him right before he gets killed  instead of just showing him dead, you know?  I think you just might answer my question.  And then there's another thing they could do.  He's laying there, dead.  Take the graphic gruesome part, if you want, and pixelate it.  Something, right?  His eyeball, so you could recognize his mouth and beard and all that shit. 
[00:47:00]  And then, you know, you could squint and kind of see the pixelated.  I think the White House had every intention of releasing that photo, and then they got  calmer heads and said, wait a minute, let's not release it.  We've got to figure this shit out.  Yeah.  And I think they know that they kind of have to.  Eventually they have to.  They have to show the picture.  Well, thank God.  Just because they say all the reasons why they didn't release the picture, that could  all change.  They could come up with reasons why now they have to show it. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  So, you know, I don't buy it.  Well, thank God.  You know, the terrorists saw that we didn't release the picture and aren't doing anything  bad.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, wait.  They just blew up a bunch of people in Pakistan.  Pak.  Pakistan.  Pakistan.  Pakistan.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  I don't think.  I didn't buy that shit.  I knew either way they were going to, you know, there was going to be some repercussions.  This is going to be a lot more, by the way.  It's a recruiting tool.  Just us going to work and fucking fucking and having women drive and shit. 
[00:48:00]  That's all recruiting tools for these people.  When will they get that through their fucking head?  You're not going to get a sane Muslim that is going to go insane because they see that  picture because we killed a leader in a radical Muslim operation.  It's the way of life we lead.  Yeah.  It's not appreciated and liked. 
[00:48:30]  And we are infidels and we must be killed no matter what.  Unless we assimilate to the Borg, they're going to keep trying to kill us.  It doesn't matter if we put pictures out.  Don't put them out.  Kill this leader.  Don't kill them.  They just don't like us.  I agree.  And Al-Qaeda.  Pass it on.  They got to do it on American soil, though.  There's an Al-Qaeda guy right there.  Someone out there that's going to be considered a rock star because he's going to be the one  that's going to be the guy that does something.  Yeah.  I mean, Pakistan, whatever.  Pakistan.  We don't give a fuck about them. 
[00:49:00]  Al-Qaeda.  I mean, the average American doesn't.  So Al-Qaeda needs to do something in America.  And unfortunately, it's going to happen.  I miss Rumsfeld and Bush saying Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda.  The way they said that.  Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda.  Yeah.  Stupid Obama with Pakistan.  We barely hear Al-Qaeda out of Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda.  So he says it too, like, you know.  Who says it like that?  Goddamn Obama.  He says it like that?  Yeah.  He's like, you know, we have to make sure Al-Qaeda, it's very, you know, regular guy. 
[00:49:30]  I like that kind of, yeah.  Rumsfeld was always good.  Al-Qaeda.  Yeah.  He'd squint.  Disgusting Al-Qaeda.  Squinty-eyed.  Oh, he's the best.  A damn lizard.  Missed that guy.  Is he a lizard?  Because we should send that to our family.  I feel bad for you because you were having a really good, solid political interview with  the guy.  It couldn't have gone better, dude.  I loved it.  He just blew up your spot.  I loved it.  And that was the way it was supposed to work. 
[00:50:00]  Trust me.  I'm not saying that you didn't have.  Oh, yeah.  But people forgot that it was really having a very solid interview with the guy.  Oh, I was so psyched to talk with Rummy.  Asking the right questions.  And Louie just swooped in with his, you're a lizard.  And knocked you off the front page.  Oh, it was great.  It was fantastic.  All right.  We should break.  Yeah.  I got to eat.  We invited Jim Jeffries back because what the fuck?  He's not around often.  He's a funny guy.  He should be here in about an hour.  And I think he's bringing, and then Kurt Metzger will come in because he's warming up 
[00:50:30]  for Jim Jeffries at Caroline's this weekend.  Kurt Metzger is a funny fucking dude, man.  Yeah.  Get him in here.  Trying to fit him in more.  Bring him over.  And then Ian Halpern's coming in.  Oh, no.  You warned the audience.  And he's bringing his goddesses who I think we really beat the shit out of last time.  So now we got to see him in person.  At least we get to see him now.  So this could get a little interesting later on, man.  Oh, Christ.  He's bringing two goddesses with him.  The ones we beat the shit out of, do you remember? 
[00:51:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  That was a couple months ago.  Good.  So.  I don't know.  Ian Halpern.  And then we get into some other things.  Sinus.  Tear.  Ugh.  Oh, God.  I think we got to talk about Brock Lesnar and Tyler Woods.  Yeah, that's fucked up, huh?  We had a good Game 7 last night.  Got the Bulls moving on.  Yeah, we got some shit to talk about.  But first, we got to eat.  Yeah.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Follow the Opie and Anthony Show online. 
[00:51:30]  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Opie Radio.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Nice.  Friday, huh?  Yes, it is.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  That's it.  Did that song go away?  Yeah, that's done.  Done.  Done, done, done, done.  Hey, did you see the boys got together to do Comfortably Numb last night? 
[00:52:00]  Or two nights ago?  I don't know how that London shit works time-wise.  What?  Yeah, fucking viral video.  Roger and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, who's here?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Roger.  No way, though.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's everywhere.  Well, I want to...  In London, they did Comfortably Numb together.  I want to see that.  Roger.  Roger Waters.  Waters and, uh...  And the other guy. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, my God.  What the fuck's wrong with me?  It's the other guy.  Well, I don't want to say the other...  What's wrong?  The fuck?  Uh, Gilmore.  Gilmore, of course.  Jesus.  David Gilmore.  Yes, of course.  David.  My David.  Uh, this thing, uh, was a big surprise for everybody, yeah.  Damn.  They did Comfortably Numb.  They reunite at a Roger Waters show.  Don't they not like each other?  But the funny thing is, when you click on this video, Roger Waters is certainly still 
[00:53:00]  doing the whole...  Wow.  The whole wall thing.  Look how fucking tall that wall is.  Jesus Christ.  Enough with the wall.  We get it.  How many years are you going to do this?  It's like 30 years.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John.  Oh.  Is the wall now just a big screen they could flash shit on?  It probably isn't even there.  I don't know.  It looks like a big screen that they now just show the wall. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, they, they...  They project a wall on a...  Backdrop?  Let's hear.  I want to hear the chorus.  The chorus.  The stupid audience has to sing along.  Right.  We got to do your job.  Thanks.  Yeah.  It would be pretty cool to see that there.  I think this album is almost 40 years old, right? 
[00:54:00]  Jesus.  Early 70s?  I'm guessing.  Really?  72.  Yeah.  Somewhere around there?  No?  Yeah.  Someone who knows music way better than me.  75?  75?  No, not the wall.  The wall was 79, right?  Oh, you know what?  Yeah.  That person's correct.  I'm thinking the band in general.  Yeah, right.  This song is only, okay, a little over 30 years old.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're right.  And listen to how good it sounds.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  And this is off of a fucking phone.  Right.  The original wall tour was 80, 81.  Oh, really?  80, 81?  Yeah.  The album did come out 79, I believe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that guy's right.  It's only the second time they've done this in 30 years.  Really?  Really?  I didn't know that.  So I guess it's a real big fucking deal.  Yeah.  I think if you're a Pink Floyd fan, this is huge.  And what was the occasion?  Yeah, what was the occasion?  What does Rolling Stone say? 
[00:55:00]  They were in London.  They're like, hey, you know.  Yeah, you don't need an occasion.  Hey, why don't we do this, bloke?  Let's do this.  I think the occasion is they saw their bank accounts are slowly dropping.  Was that it?  Like their fuel tanks and said, you know what?  Why don't we fucking pump up our bank accounts a little bit?  Because just them appearing together, I bet you, made people go out and buy Pink Floyd  shit.  It's like when Christopher Guest came running out on Spinal Tap at the end.  They bring him back on stage after they split up. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  The place went wild when they did Sex Farmer.  And then everyone fucking had to buy Spinal Tap.  Working on a sex farm.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the screen.  Wow, that's fucking wild, though.  Yeah.  There's videos everywhere today.  You'll find it.  These bands are probably like, man, if we had this shit back in the day, as they called  it, the day.  As I recall, Pink Floyd actually had a wall that had to be constructed. 
[00:56:00]  It was made of blocks and bricks of, I guess, some kind of styrofoam or whatever.  And then a giant flying thing would come down a cable and crash through.  Now you could just fucking do it all.  You could go and scream the whole fucking thing.  Yeah, now you just fake it.  Yeah, why not?  Looks great.  So, yeah, that's something everyone's talking about today.  Yeah.  Doomsday, May 21st, huh? 
[00:56:30]  When is that coming up?  I guess we've got one week left on Earth.  21st?  One week left.  Are we going to work the week or just enjoy ourselves?  Well, if we believe the Earth is ending, then I think we should be the last show.  If a bunch of people believed that, last show.  I think we should close it down right now, man.  Yeah.  Why not?  Oh, my God.  That was the closest I've ever come to sneezing without sneezing.  I swear I thought I was going to sneeze.  Right.  I hate that. 
[00:57:00]  I know I'm driving everyone nuts around here by saying it every day, but this fucking  allergy season is just, it has destroyed me.  I never get affected by allergies.  And you're getting a little bit?  A little bit.  Yeah.  I'm noticing like stuffy nose and watery eyes and shit.  I'm like a chemist at home.  I'm trying to figure out the combo that's going to get rid of this shit.  You need like an AIDS cocktail for fucking pollen?  Oh, yes.  Pollen.  I'm trying all sorts of fucking combos, man.  Today it's Claritin D, which seems to be helping. 
[00:57:30]  Ooh.  I woke up this morning, complete red eyes, slits, and just so much snot.  Yeah.  I couldn't hear.  In your ears?  My ears, my nose.  I got what looks like a goiter on the side of my neck because my fucking gland is so swollen.  Ow.  It's just a nightmare.  Hurt to swallow?  And I come in here every day going, all right, don't bitch and complain because everyone's  had it with you and your stupid allergies, but I can't help it.  Yeah, it sucks.  It's a fucking, it's been horrible this year. 
[00:58:00]  Fucking horrible.  They said worst one in.  Yeah, worst one ever.  How do they know ever?  Well.  I'm sure there's a dinosaur somewhere sneezing his ass off.  That was, that was really sneezing a lot.  I hate that worst.  Ever.  In history.  Worst ever.  Because we don't, because we're so pompous.  We've only been recording history, I don't know, depending on what you believe.  A thousand years.  But what about the thousands of years before that?  Somebody was probably.  What are those records?  Some caveman is like waking up.  Oh, man, my nose is itching. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, sure.  I'm running nose.  And I would assume before we built all these cities and fucking towns and track housing,  I imagine the allergies were even worse because there were more green shit around.  Come out of your cave, it's just nothing but bushes and green shit.  Right, right.  You're absolutely going to be sneezing.  Right.  Oh, those poor cavemen.  You only think of like saber-toothed tigers and shit that they had to deal with.  How about the simple things?  Allergies.  Allergies, calluses.  And not being able to see and no one fucking invented glasses yet. 
[00:59:00]  That's the thing that really trips me out.  You just had to deal with bad eyesight.  That's what trips me out when I think about cavemen.  Because we all think about cavemen, right?  Oh, we all do.  There was some good shit.  I mean, you got to fuck whatever you wanted without any repercussions.  They weren't as hot as they are now.  I understand we kind of need laws, but wow, what a great way to live.  But you did have to duke it out with somebody else that wanted to fuck her.  True.  And like, you might die.  Well, you only lived until you were 17 or something.  Oh, yeah, please.  You were a grandfather at 12.  I mean, yeah, there's a downside. 
[00:59:30]  Get it while you could.  But I always think about that.  There had to be cavemen that couldn't see shit.  Yeah.  With all that craziness going on around them.  Oh, man.  Like, what is that?  Right.  Is that a fucking bush or is it something that's going to kill me?  I can't even swing a club at it.  I can't see.  I can't see, god damn it.  A saber-toothed tiger jumped at me.  Right.  You can't get glasses.  Pulling a hammy probably meant your death back then.  Oh, man.  Because without a good hammy, man, you're... 
[01:00:00]  You can't run.  You're in trouble.  You couldn't run.  No.  If you smashed your finger with a rock, you're just done.  You'd die from it.  I think so.  I think you'd die from shit like that.  Yeah.  Maybe we're a hearty bunch, though.  Oh, god bless the listeners that care about me.  But I've tried all this shit.  I've tried the Zyrtec.  Have you?  I've tried everything.  I got Ziz...  What is it?  Zizol, I think it's called, from the doctor.  Zizol?  Zyrtec?  The stupidologist wants me...  I gotta be a shot guy.  Really? 
[01:00:30]  You need, like, a needle?  Yeah, my nickname at home is Bubble Boy.  Makes me feel like a fucking man.  The moops.  My whole family calls me Bubble Boy.  Oh, Bubble Boy's sneezing again.  But I gotta do shots, I think, for three straight months every week.  What a pain in the ass.  And just when I'm willing to give in, then the allergies go away and I forget until next year.  And it's like, ah, I could deal with it.  It wasn't really that bad.  Right.  Whenever anything goes away, you forget how bad it was.  True.  It comes back.  And then you go, ah, I'll deal with that.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  I kinda like our caveman bit we're starting up here.  I like that.  The poor caveman, really...  It's very organic.  I think we could go with this one.  Just had nothing but, like, rocks and little logs and stuff to do.  And what can you make out of a rock?  What if you're born without hearing as a caveman and just walking around your caveman neighborhood  and having no fucking clue what's behind you?  And they probably had no idea, like, what that meant, if somebody can't hear, so they  probably just clubbed him over the head and killed him.  I said, fuck that.  Yeah, fuck this guy. 
[01:01:30]  Then why did that continue?  This guy's an asshole.  He's not even listening to me.  Then why did that continue through time?  What, that we club and kill the deaf?  No, no, no, no.  But if you're a caveman, you're like, you've decided as a caveman society, if you fucking  can't hear, you gotta die.  You're useless, yeah.  Then aren't you knocking that fucking DNA and that gene wave of it down?  Well, I guess it's something you can't beat out of people.  Yeah.  That whole thing.  Many different causes, I gather.  Another thought, because we're talking about allergies for a second, and I won't move on.  I won't bitch.  I apologize ahead of time. 
[01:02:00]  But when you have, like, a weird thing, like allergies or something, you want to go back  in time and see what fucking ancestor fucked something they were not supposed to fuck.  That genetic string that fucked you up.  Because that's where all this shit comes from.  Yeah.  You had a fucking ancestor that couldn't keep their dick out of the shitty fucking women.  I guess there was something to be said.  Or vice versa, I don't know.  Something to be said for selective breeding?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  It would have kind of been nice if everybody just did away with people that had bad genetics. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  And just have one race of people that were healthy.  Yeah.  Good genetics.  Sure.  Longevity.  Sure.  Why not?  Very minimal diseases.  Yeah, I know.  Blonde hair.  Blue eyes.  I almost got the blonde hair.  But I got a little red in it, which means one of my ancestors fucked some weird thing in  the past, too.  You're saying we should raise a nation of super kids?  Well, yeah.  You would love my kid, man. 
[01:03:00]  He's just a little fucking Hitler youth looking.  He's a Nazi propaganda.  Little kid.  Nazi propaganda poster.  Dude.  Yeah.  The blondest hair ever.  Yeah.  Ever.  He almost looks albino when he's out in the sun.  He's so blonde.  That's what you need.  And fucking the bluest eyes.  That's it.  Put a little Nazi hat on him.  Take some pictures.  You know what?  He'd be adorable.  Everyone knows I want viral shit to happen in my life, viral videos and viral pictures.  Kid's going to need a job someday. 
[01:03:30]  Trust me.  I know I could get a few viral videos out of him.  There you go in there.  But getting glasses makes your eyes worse and worse.  Oh, yeah?  What is that about, Cassius?  Cassius.  Hey, guys.  What's making you laugh?  I like how he just, hey, hey.  What's making you laugh?  I know we're kind of doing a little pot talk here.  Hey, hey.  Don't pot talk.  No, I often think about this because you were talking about cavemen and, like, what did 
[01:04:00]  people do before glasses?  Like, because I'm really nearsighted and, like, it's very common.  And I started checking into it.  There's a little video on YouTube.  If you just put in myopia, you should be able to find it.  But it's like, when your vision first starts going bad when we're kids, they send you to  the eye doctor, you get glasses, and it's just, it, it, all it does is make it worse.  So it's like, we just keep needing vision correction over and over, and it just, all it does is 
[01:04:30]  make the vision worse.  Yeah, I've heard that with certain, and I think with certain type of vision problems, that  might be true.  But there are other things, like, you know, that just happen, where, you know, you're reading,  you need reading glasses or something.  Think of the poor caveman.  And he, he walks up to that wall where they've been drawing buffalo and shit and planning  out their hunt with the sick figures, with the spears and stuff.  And he's looking, going, I don't even know where I'm supposed to be. 
[01:05:00]  Which one is, could you help me out here?  Which blob am I going to be in this hunt?  Yeah, what is that?  And he fucks the hunt up because he runs out too soon.  Well, we got the eye shit figured out.  Anyone that's young, they're not sponsors anymore, but anyone that's young, and you're wearing  glasses or contacts, you're just stupid.  This LASIK was amazing for me.  But now that I'm a middle-aged guy, now I'm having some problems, which the guy told me  a long time ago, what happened?  And I got it late in my life. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  If you're, like, 20, you could go easily 20 years with crystal clear fucking vision.  Great vision, no glasses.  And then maybe eventually, when you do get in your 40s, they talk about reading glasses  and shit, and that's kind of where I'm at now.  But not the reading glasses.  I have to use them for driving.  I just need longer arms.  I get it?  Because it's here.  What about the problems, the risks of LASIK, Opie?  You know, in a lot of people, it causes...  You know what?  Me and Ant turned on probably thousands, seriously, thousands of people to LASIK back when we're 
[01:06:00]  at NUW, the fine Dr. Filatoff, who's no longer with us, which kills me, because he was becoming  a friend of mine.  Just a great fucking guy that left way too early, full of life, and he gets the pancreatic  cancer.  Healthy, and within a year, he's dead.  Unbelievable.  Horrible, horrible story.  But anyway, what I tell people, because they always come to me, because they remember the  live reads from the past, you've got to find a guy that's been doing it a really long time. 
[01:06:30]  If you get a newbie, that's where you're going to have the problems.  But if you've got an experienced guy, the odds of them fucking up anything is almost nil.  But it's not necessarily...  I'm not talking about fucking it up, but I'm talking about it's real common for people to  have halos at night and...  Not the people we turned on to, because they went to a guy that knew what he was doing.  I'm telling you, thousands and thousands of people, I swear to you, not one person ever  got a hold of me and said, you know, my eyes are fucked up. 
[01:07:00]  Thanks a lot, dude.  Wow.  Not one.  I would assume there might have been a few, because just the odds say that it can't be  perfect no matter what, but the odds are overwhelmingly...  You're going to see great, and you're not going to have issues.  Maybe they all died.  Died from horrible eye surgery.  Died at the hands of Dr. Philopoff.  Yes.  He was actually a serial killer, and that's why they had to take him out.  Yes.  The government took him out. 
[01:07:30]  Every single one of them dead.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I know when LASIK became really popular, because when me and Ant first started,  started doing those live reads, it was kind of just growing.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, Dr. Philopoff used to have to take his patients to Canada and Mexico, because it  wasn't legal in the United States, and then they made it legal in the United States, and  it was a really good business.  So a lot of guys went, believe it or not, to Florida, and were taught how to do LASIK,  and next thing you know, they're flying back to New York or Jersey, and they're fucking  working on your eyes without not a lot of experience. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  So just find someone that has done it for a long time.  I remember when they had a, it was a radial keratotomy years ago, where they would actually  kind of make these little incisions on your cornea away from your pupil.  Yeah, they used a steak knife.  And try to, they would just gouge at your eyeball.  Yeah.  Yeah, actually, a Navy SEAL would shoot you in the eye, and it would cure that eyesight 
[01:08:30]  problem.  As long as you didn't move, you were fine, but you weren't allowed to move or blink.  Don't move.  You'll die.  Well, you know, I remember the comedian, Kathy Griffin.  Comedian.  Yeah, right.  Comedian.  Comedian.  Can I stop you for a second?  I don't know what I think of her.  What do you think Kathy Griffin is?  To me, she's just there.  I think she tries way the fuck too hard to be the edgy comic.  But is that her gimmick?  I don't know. 
[01:09:00]  Like that.  I don't know.  I know.  She was funny on Seinfeld on that episode where she was doing the Jerry Seinfeld.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was funny back then.  I know the gays love her.  Is the devil.  Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.  Sorry, I didn't see her on that.  That's fantastic.  She's such a bitch.  Oh.  And she has become, she's so hard to look at now with all the work she's had done.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what you're thinking about.  Dude, you just led us to our next fucking thing I want to talk about.  But first you, Cassius.  What were you saying?  She had the LASIK or some kind of a corrective surgery done and totally fucked up her eyes. 
[01:09:30]  And she had to, you know, go to like two or three other eye doctors and have it fixed.  But on her website, she had, there's all this like warning about LASIK.  And there was, it would lead you to a site with all these eye doctors who have done the LASIK, who were offering it.  And she had all their photographs up of each eye doctor. 
[01:10:00]  And they were all wearing glasses.  Like not one of them were not.  All right, that's, that is a little fucked up.  Yeah.  But look up, look up the myopia little video on YouTube.  It's, it's, it's pretty funny.  It like explains, you know, wearing glasses fucks you up.  I'm sure three people will do that thing.  Oh yeah, we'll get right on it when there's pornography to be seen.  Exactly.  Let's watch a medical video on YouTube that'll entertain everyone.  Yeah, yeah, it's great.  On a Friday of all days.  No, it's funny audio. 
[01:10:30]  It's only like a minute.  No, I'll check it out.  It's hysterical.  Thank you, Cassius.  Yeah, man, thanks a lot.  Thanks.  A regular to the show, I pay attention.  Cassius calls a lot.  I just know that name.  Hey, the guy said Kathy Griffin is hard to look at because of all the surgery and shit she's done.  Probably the Botox.  Yeah.  Did you see the video of the worst mother alive?  Oh, with the eight-year-old, I guess?  Yes.  Yeah.  Is that real?  I don't know.  But there's a mom giving her eight-year-old Botox. 
[01:11:00]  Botox?  That's great.  To get rid of some, what, fucking wrinkles or something?  Is she getting wrinkles at eight years old?  You know, like...  Is that...  The video's real, right?  I didn't see it.  Okay, I don't know.  Danny's really good at this shit.  Let's see if this is the real deal.  Botox for an eight-year-old.  Well, it says it.  Oh, it's ABC News.  ABC News?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's the San Francisco mom who is injecting her eight-year-old daughter with Botox to get  rid of wrinkles.  And she insists that she is not the only mom who's doing it. 
[01:11:30]  Lara Spencer spoke with the mom, Carrie, and her daughter, Brittany, in a GMA exclusive.  And Lara joins us with that story.  Hey, Lara.  Yeah, shaking your head.  It does sound unreal.  A mother injecting her eight-year-old daughter with Botox to prevent wrinkles the little girl  thinks she has.  And it didn't stop there.  The mother has also waxed her little girl's upper leg area to keep up in the intense world  of kiddie pageants.  I sat down with the girl, Brittany, and her mom to learn exactly how young is too young. 
[01:12:00]  I do it, but it hurts sometimes.  By the way, your dog is ugly.  The pain eight-year-old Brittany describes doesn't come from falling off her bike or losing  a tooth, but from this, Botox injections administered by her mother.  Is that illegal?  Can you show me where you do it?  Can you point on your face?  Yeah, sometimes I do it right here.  A little bit.  And what do you do it for?  Look at her mom.  She's just a big, fat pig.  All those pageant moms are fat pigs trying to rip her life for an eight-year-old. 
[01:12:30]  It's sick shit.  Like wrinkles and it just...  Your kid isn't a pageant-looking kid either.  No, not at all.  Believe me, I watch them all.  Little Miss Perfect Pageant.  Brittany's mother says she started giving the injections to keep up with the beauty-take-all  world of the pageant circuit, an idea she says was planted by other pageant moms.  And they were just telling me about the lines on her face and how, you know, a lot of 
[01:13:00]  the moms there, they're giving their kids Botox and it's pretty much like the thing.  I'm not the only one that does it.  Oh, good.  A lot of moms do it.  What a piece of shit.  Well, then, that makes it okay, then.  Making the big impression on the lines on her face and stuff.  Well, the pageant kids...  The lines on her face at eight?  The pageant kids, you just got to give up on.  You can't save them.  You can't save them or their moms.  You show the lines on her face aren't just pillow creases.  She wakes up and it's like, ah!  You just start injecting pillow creases on your face and be gone in ten minutes, but 
[01:13:30]  Botox!  The mother looks retarded, by the way.  She does.  Like retarded.  Just slightly off, right?  But you're 34.  I mean, I'm just wondering...  I've been doing it for a long time.  That's a 34-year-old woman?  Wow.  What the fuck happened to her?  You're an esthetician.  Part-time.  Where do you get the Botox?  Steal it.  I do not, like, put that out there.  Go.  I do have a trust and source where I get it.  Oh, really?  But you'll allow them to show you injecting your daughter?  Behind me.  I'm sure the authorities won't have a problem with that. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  These photos, taken during one of Brittany's Botox treatments, capture just how uncomfortable...  Kids got ice all over her face, ice bags, gauze.  I'm going to say it another ten times.  It hurts.  And I get destroyed and...  I get destroyed?  What?  A little.  You do.  Just because the mom has a shitty life.  Where is the Department of Social Services?  I don't know.  Child welfare.  It's a long story, so we'll stop there. 
[01:14:30]  Wow, a real long story, huh?  That's a big feature.  What are you kidding?  They probably teased the shit out of that one.  Well, that's a...  Coming up on ABC News, Botox for eight-year-olds?  You know why?  Da-da-da-da.  May sweeps?  May sweeps, yes.  We're in the middle of May sweeps.  So they've got to get sexy things.  They've got to get outrageous things.  They want to evoke people's emotions.  We've got to bring back the news tease, because May sweeps...  Yeah.  I'm seeing some news teases again.  Great one.  I was watching Bowling for Columbine again the other day. 
[01:15:00]  Just to be annoyed?  Yeah, sometimes I watch things just to be annoyed.  And there are some parts of that movie that are pretty clever and done well.  I'll give them that much.  It's a fun movie, but I don't take it seriously.  Yeah, I'm not taking it as a law.  But there's that part where they get to all the news teases.  The society...  What is it?  The something of fear.  Culture of fear. 
[01:15:30]  Culture of fear.  Thank you.  I actually read that book.  Culture of fear.  Changed my life.  Yeah.  It really did.  And you realize, bah, not bad.  One of the books I read when we're not on the air.  And I said, holy shit, the media's full of shit.  Eh, not bad.  But they were just going through one after another after another of these just ridiculous  headlines from the news teases.  And it's just fantastic how they do that.  And especially like May sweeps, yeah.  They love pulling out the underage stuff, teen things. 
[01:16:00]  And they're the first ones that get on anybody for exploiting sexuality, especially in teens  and things like that.  But they're the first ones to do it.  Yeah, of course.  And you'd never hear about it if they hadn't put it on their news program.  Of course.  We might as well do our Hall of Fame of news teasers today.  Oh, I love it.  We haven't done this in a while.  Yes, this is for the sweeps.  Danny, can we bring this back?  Can we start?  Oh, we don't have interns. 
[01:16:30]  This was grunt work for interns.  Not really.  It's just like, I can find the news teases, but I need to know where they are.  So it's impossible to find them if you don't know about them.  Yeah, that's true.  Can the listeners send them in?  They can absolutely.  Well, you know what?  If they could send them in, that's great.  But if they could also, like telling me about a news tease is great.  But if you know what station and what the news tease was about, that's even better because  I could actually get like keywords.  So like, if you know it's about toddlers in a car, say, hey, there was something about  toddlers in a car on WPJX in Memphis, Tennessee. 
[01:17:00]  Let me know all that stuff and then I can try and hunt it down and grab it.  What email?  I don't even know.  Where should we have these things sent anymore?  I don't even know what's a good place for this.  Steve C.  Use Opie Anthony at SiriusXM.  Let's do that.  Yeah.  Opie Anthony.  Opie Anthony.  Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  Putting like news tease in the subject header.  Because I want to start up this bit again because we love this fucking thing.  But why not?  We haven't done it in a while. 
[01:17:30]  We got our Hall of Fame of news teases.  It's quick.  We'll go one after another.  Trying to scare people.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  We've played hundreds of these over the years.  And these are the best of the best.  We only have eight of them.  One of them.  That's great.  Thinking that you're going to have a sex offender right there next door to you.  Yeah.  It sounds like it's going to happen to everybody.  It sounds like it's a village of sex offenders.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How a twist on the predator law could shut down religion. 
[01:18:00]  That, I don't understand how anyone wrote that and rolled it on a teleprompter.  That doesn't even make sense.  If you were the newsreader, wouldn't you go, what?  How do you shut down religion?  You can't shut down religion.  And we've had wars that can't shut down religion.  And we've had that clip.  We've had that clip for a while, right?  Yeah.  Religion still rolling right along, right?  Oh, that's right.  Still rolling along, yep.  Still rolling along.  And by the way, I don't think there's sex offender town. 
[01:18:30]  I don't think sex offender-ville opened up.  That never popped up.  No, that never popped up.  That is good that we play these because we could kind of look back and see, did any of  these things happen?  Oh, good.  A new little twist on this.  Yeah, yeah.  Could frequent hiccups be a sign of cancer?  Watch News 8 at 10.  Are they?  I don't know.  It could probably, it probably, if you have esophageal cancer or something like that,  it might get the hiccups, but it doesn't mean that hiccups, it doesn't mean that hiccups  will mean you have cancer, but it does mean that if you have a certain type of cancer, 
[01:19:00]  you might get hiccups.  Like, it's different.  It doesn't mean that.  It's scaring everyone, that hiccups.  Or you might get hiccups if you drink soda too fast.  Right.  There's a big drop-off there.  Yes.  Are you normal?  Thursday at 11 on News 8.  I love that one.  Are you normal?  I gotta tune in.  I think I am.  I don't know if I'm normal.  I better watch this guy so they can tell me if I am.  We gotta bring this bit back so we can answer the Hall of Fame. 
[01:19:30]  Here's another one.  The problem solvers have uncovered sexual predators sent to live in our nursing homes.  Do you really know who's living down the hall?  Could this happen to your mother?  That's about time she got some action.  Why not?  Yeah, right?  What the hell?  Been a while.  Whether she wants it or not.  Could your house be making you fat?  Tomorrow, CBS 2 News at 5.  How does your house make you fat?  I don't know.  He runs on vacation. 
[01:20:00]  How does that happen?  How does your house make you fat?  Think.  You're pretty good for shit.  I'm trying to think, is it the design where you would have to pass the kitchen to get  to the bedroom and it makes you kind of open the fridge and eat before you go to bed?  Is it something in the air?  How does your house make you fat?  How does your house make you fat?  I can't eat the Twinkie machine. 
[01:20:30]  There's Twinkie machines in your house.  That would be very bad.  You take a shower and what?  Whipped cream just comes out?  Yeah.  You don't know.  What the fuck?  In your house.  Somebody help me out.  Now, I'm trying to picture the reporter doing the story, right?  They're going to a house and they'll go, all right, let's show you now, if you don't  go out, if you don't have a place to exercise, uh-oh, is your house making you fat?  All I had to do was type in house making fat. 
[01:21:00]  Wait, before we-  And this was an article from like last year.  Wow.  So I guess this is one of those slow news topics.  I think it's for women's health can help you lose weight.  Wait, I don't want to know the answer yet because I'm trying to fucking figure this out  on my own.  How could your house make you fat?  I think it's the layout.  I'm going to go with the layout of your house.  But not everyone has a new modular home or whatever.  But they're not saying you could fix it.  They're just saying, is it making you fat, I think. 
[01:21:30]  I think if you lay your house out in a certain way where you're passing by the food in order  to get to things you have to get to, like a bathroom or this or that, and you come out  of the bathroom and you just, you know, open the fridge.  What about a lot of automatic stuff?  Think remotes.  Yeah.  A lot of remotes, so you're not getting any exercise.  You're not getting up as much.  Something about no exercise.  Okay.  Okay.  What about if you got nice air conditioning?  Does that...  I love air conditioning.  Oh, my God.  How does your house make you fat? 
[01:22:00]  Are we going to be surprised by the answers?  I didn't read it.  Is your house making you fat?  All right.  What do you got in your house?  You got heat.  You got AC.  You got lights.  What could the lights do?  You got...  Unless you're eating them.  I don't know.  This is a weird one, man.  The other ones, we could tell you why, but...  Yeah.  This one was always...  This one always got me like, what?  All right.  What's the answer?  Let's see.  Number one.  Turn up the lighting in your kitchen and dining room. 
[01:22:30]  Dim lights make food look more attractive, which encourages binge eating.  Ah, so if it's dark, you're just going to dig right into any shit that's in your fridge.  That's bullshit.  Ah.  Let's see.  Avoid painting the walls red, yellow, and orange in the kitchen and dining areas.  These colors may make us hungry.  May make us hungry.  I've been around a while now.  I've never walked into a kitchen that was red, yellow, or orange, first of all.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  It's pretty much bland colors in there, right?  Yeah, and if it's yellow, it's not like, oh, boy, the walls are yellow.  I'm starving.  What do we got back there?  It says to use blue, like silverware, or blue plates, or blue everything, because apparently...  It makes you blue.  Blue.  I'm not hungry anymore.  There was some study where people who dined in a blue room ate 33% less food than those  that ate in a yellow or red room.  Why?  That doesn't make any sense.  But why?  Oh, my God.  I don't even know what... 
[01:23:30]  I'm trying to even tell you the color of my kitchen.  I guess it's white.  I got a lot of different colors because of the cabinets and everything, but...  I will.  Okay.  Downsize, it says here.  Extensive diet research shows that people eat what's put on their plates.  Ah, well, of course.  And that, by the way, has nothing to do with the house.  Nothing to do with the house.  Well, this one says stay out of the kitchen.  Oh, okay.  That's some good advice.  There you go.  Just board it up.  I would board it up and never go in there again.  Just get rid of the kitchen. 
[01:24:00]  Leave it like, I don't know, the room of a child that's died.  Just shut the door, lock it, throw the key away.  A lot of these are diet tips, not...  Yeah, they're not your house making you fat.  You can't have a house without a kitchen, asshole.  Dumb fatties blaming their house.  Well, you should also spray lavender on your bed pillows, folks.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  It says studies show that natural remedies like lavender can help promote healthy sleep  cycles, which in turn may help promote weight loss.  Yeah, sleeping promotes weight loss?  Really?  I'm embarrassed to say it, but I have a little lavender in my bedroom. 
[01:24:30]  Do you?  A little lavender?  I have one of those smoke machines that pops out a little lavender scent.  Yeah.  A scent to try to relax a little?  Yeah, we walked into one of these fucking hippie yoga fucking spiritual new age fucking  places.  And they got me, though.  The stupid thing with the...  What is it?  The mist?  Yeah.  It's blowing, and all you do is put a little lavender oil on top, and it heats it up or something.  I don't know.  And then you see the little cloud of lavender mist, and you walk into this place, it smells  awesome. 
[01:25:00]  That's kind of cool.  So they got me.  I said, I need one of those.  I like the idea that lavender is a color and a scent.  It annoys me.  It's like orange.  Orange.  Orange, yeah, yeah.  I got orange, too.  Mint.  We could do this all day.  Hey, what's your favorite scent that's a color out there, folks?  But is mint really a color?  Yeah.  It's green.  It's a color.  It's not like, ah, that smells like green.  What a shitty car.  That's an ugly car.  What color is it?  Mint.  Yeah, I think Danny's right.  I would just say green. 
[01:25:30]  Mint green.  Mint green.  It's a color.  It's forest green.  I had a forest green truck once.  Forest?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  My first SUV, my S10 blazer, was forest green.  I used to follow that one through wine dance, right?  Yeah, you did.  Yeah, I remember that.  When the fucking shootouts were happening.  That's great.  Orange is a good scent for my little mist machine.  Oh, yeah?  You like that, too?  Yeah.  Little orange.  And before you beat the shit out of me, I don't know where the mist machine is these  days.  Oh, you lost it? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, it's been a while.  But I did have lavender scent for a while.  You know, sometimes I just put the dumb oil on my pillow and say, fuck the mist.  Let's just get some good smelling pillows, because I don't want to smell my bad breath  anymore on my pillow.  You drool.  Keep your pillows full of drool.  Right.  Keep simple workout equipment around the house.  Just laying around?  What, so you just pick it up and do a little set?  I like that.  I'm not even going to say the joke, but having dumbbells around your house, that's okay. 
[01:26:30]  Why is he on vacation?  I know.  You're like, could you hang out in my house?  Why?  Well, they say we need dumbbells around the house.  We need dumbbells around the house.  Oh, he would hate us.  Get rid of fat clothes.  Again, this isn't your fucking house.  What is fat clothes?  Women often have clothes that span in sizes.  Oh, baggy shit?  This makes it easy to gain weight.  Yeah, they keep their fat clothes.  I guess if you're fat, you don't want to get rid of your fat clothes, because then you'll  have no clothes.  A lot of people don't want to get rid of their clothes, because they spent money on their 
[01:27:00]  clothes.  Right.  So even though you did a diet and you got down on a nice weight, you're like, oh, man,  but I spent like whatever on that fucking jacket.  I could wear a belt.  Yeah.  I'll wear a belt with it.  Yeah.  Decorate slim.  What the hell does that mean?  Keep a magazine clipping, women's health, perhaps on your fridge.  Use this visual to help you imagine how you will feel when you achieve your goal.  Again, that's not really a house thing.  That's a fucking stick something on your fridge thing. 
[01:27:30]  And how are you going to see it if you're supposed to stay out of your kitchen?  It's so stupid.  They're stupid.  They told us to stay out of the kitchen, but then put shit on your fridge.  Move your fridge to your bedroom.  Right.  We don't have to do the rest.  It's just dumb.  Oh, it's dumb.  We're in the Hall of Fame of news teasers, because I think we're finally going to bring  this bit back.  So this gives everybody a little example of what we're looking for.  Yeah.  Not the basic news teas.  They've got to be over the top, and then you get a hold of Travis and Danny at opianthony  at SiriusXM.com.  Okay?  Right.  We've got two more in our Hall of Fame. 
[01:28:00]  We only have eight total.  And the ingredients in shampoo that can make a boy develop breasts.  Tonight at 10.  That's just stupid.  That's fantastic.  That's just stupid.  That is so alarmist.  How much shampoo would you have to use to grow breasts if there was a little ingredient  in there?  I just picked some boy with head and shoulders just rubbing it into his tits.  Right.  Come on.  Once again, the ingredient, what?  Is it like whipped cream or something?  What is it?  You can't help yourself and you've got to fucking eat it while you're shaking your hair?  I don't know.  No, it goes into your head.  It goes into your head, does it? 
[01:28:30]  That's dumb.  Is it a hormone that's in certain shampoo?  And how much do they grow?  Make you grow breasts.  You get just giant double D's in one day.  You wash your hair.  You go to bed.  You wake up.  You've got giant tits.  And as a young boy, is that bad?  You could just play with them.  Remember our old friend, the breast hypnotist?  Oh, God.  We should do some old school bits one day.  Oh, God.  This goes way back.  But I knew he was a carny and full of shit. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  But you got these women to come in and they would just talk about their breasts.  Oh, my breasts got bigger.  Do you think they got bigger?  Can you take a look?  And then they were measuring them and you could tell.  And they're squeezing each other's breasts to see if they fucking got big.  And of course, me and you were like, oh, yeah, they got bigger.  All right.  That's wonderful.  Are you sure?  How about I punch them?  They swell up.  And they're bigger.  This hypnotist would fucking do a little mumbo jumbo.  Yeah.  He's like, it's increasing the blood flow.  And then they would take a measurement with a tape measure and pretty much cinch it up 
[01:29:30]  and squeeze their tits down when they first measure it.  And then when he's done, it's pretty much hanging, barely brushing their tits.  You've gained two full inches around you.  Because it's part of the carny game.  Everyone wants to believe.  So if you're the one having your breasts measured and you know the tape's a little loose,  you're not going to be the bra that says, hey, tighten that up.  No, you're going to go, oh, my breasts got bigger.  You want to believe they got bigger in the end?  Yeah.  It was brilliant on this guy's part.  Yeah.  He was one of these radio guys that, well, he was hired by literally every radio station 
[01:30:00]  in America.  That was his job going from station to station to station.  And what, did he have something he was selling?  Oh, I think the tapes, right?  The tapes, yes.  His tapes that you'd put them on and relax and listen to them and your tits would get bigger.  He said they would get even bigger.  He goes, look, I only got an hour on the radio, and look, you gain a third of an inch,  but if you do this...  Yeah, step right this way behind the curtain and see if the tits get bigger. 
[01:30:30]  If you do this regularly.  Ladies and gentlemen.  When I'm not around, well, how do you do that?  Well, you've got to buy one of my cassette tapes.  Buy my tapes.  Are people still doing that type of radio?  Like, are there?  Or did that dry up for all those people?  Because we used to have those guys on and other, like, similar hacks selling their shit.  I was certainly a student of radio, and I realized the other day I was driving to Long  Island, and I see it in my car.  You've got the satellite, and then you've got the AM, which I do a lot for news, and 
[01:31:00]  then there's that weird FM button.  I'm going, I don't know.  When was the last time?  I swear to you, it's got to be since we were at K-Rock.  Wow.  Yeah.  I swear to you.  So I finally hit that FM button, and I spun around the dial here in New York to see what  the fuck's going on.  What's going on in radio?  Wow.  Wow.  It's just a disaster.  Wow.  It's all just pop music, first of all.  Pop music, and more pop music.  Nothing compelling, no talk, really.  No, nothing.  Nothing even in between the songs. 
[01:31:30]  Absolutely nothing.  Personality is gone.  And, you know, we don't have to sell this shit to the people listening, but you notice  how much different the sound sounds, too.  Yeah.  It's uncomfortable to listen to.  Wow.  Because you're so used to, you know, digital with the satellite and all that.  I would love to get in on the conversation with you, but I don't think I've listened  to FM even during K-Rock.  I was barely listening at that point, too.  I can't even tell you the last time I hit the FM button.  Wow.  It's all about, yeah, AM news.  And then these dummies, they still haven't figured out after all these years that you 
[01:32:00]  shouldn't take your commercial breaks at the exact same time everyone else is.  Because that's when everyone goes to try to find something new.  Find something else.  So what, they're not brave enough to, they don't believe in their product enough to break  the mold?  We can't do that.  It's got to be this hour, this part of the hour, yeah.  Because the song ends, DJ comes on with complete nonsense.  They haven't said anything relevant in, I would say, at least 10 years, except for a handful  of shows over the years.  Yeah.  But now, no one is allowed to say shit on FM radio. 
[01:32:30]  So I'm like, okay, now I want to go see what other people are doing.  And every station was in commercials at the exact same time.  That is so stupid.  Why would you do that?  I would break that mold, because all those other stations, those people, they just want  to hear something that's not a commercial.  You're too scared.  Do you think a program director has the balls to go into his boss and say, I want to change  where we fucking break?  No, no.  And then if someone did, like, have the balls to actually do it, and something happened where  it didn't work out, he'd be fired in a week. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then they'd go back to the normal thing, because they don't want to give anything time.  Yeah.  A bunch of fucking hacks.  The final news tease from the Hall of Fame is this one.  Sex offenders may be in your house.  And I love it.  Getting fat?  In your house.  Sex offenders may be in your house.  Well, obviously, it could be the cable guy, the plumber.  It could be whatever.  Oh, is that what they're going at?  Of course.  Yeah, that's true.  Anybody you hire to come in and do a little maintenance.  Do a little work in your house? 
[01:33:30]  Of course.  It could be a sex offender.  I prefer to think that there just might be one there.  Yeah, like, you didn't know?  You just haven't found him yet.  You haven't found him?  He's, like, hiding somewhere?  How creepy is that?  Oh, shit, I better check my house.  There's a sex offender in there.  Hey, we're right.  He's in my attic.  Haven't looked in the closet for a while.  Fuck!  Yeah, you're right.  Get out of here, you!  I think I watch the news.  Yeah.  They make it sound, yeah, like he's just walking around.  Right.  So let's do news teases again if we can.  If we get this going, I'd be very excited. 
[01:34:00]  And if anybody wants to send him in again, it helps a lot.  Even if you don't have the file, just describe it and we can try to find it.  So the city, the local call letters.  And you know what, too?  Tell us what it actually was about, because a lot of times we get left hanging with a  good tease and we don't know.  Yeah, we do kind of like to know what the story was.  Right.  Because we like to try to figure it out.  Like, the house getting fat thing is just dumb.  Yeah.  And I apologize to Travis and Danny in advance, because now they're going to have to deal  with a lot of shitty news teases that someone thinks is good. 
[01:34:30]  This is great.  You see this one?  All right.  So OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  All right.  Jim Jeffries should be here very soon.  Kurt Metzger, a very funny comic who's doing very well on his own.  He's warming up for Jeffries at Caroline's this weekend.  And Ian Halpern with his goddesses.  You might want to stick around for that, because Jim Jeffries likes to be confrontational.  Ian Halpern likes to be confrontational.  Goddesses are going to have sticks up their asses from the last time we had them on the show. 
[01:35:00]  They're going to be angry.  It could be a recipe for disaster.  It's a news tease.  Let's talk about Brock Lesnar next.  Let's talk about Roger Daltrey next.  Let's talk about Ashton Kutcher next.  Roger D is in the news.  And let's talk about the latest Bin Laden shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  He was, I got to say this before the break.  I can't help myself.  He was allegedly killed in his underwear?  Yes.  That came out yesterday?  Yeah.  That came out yesterday.  That he might have just been in his drawers there, walking around in his drawers and got 
[01:35:30]  popped in the face in the undies.  Wow.  You think he had like piss stains in the front?  He didn't look like he was in a very clean place.  Just a bunch of drips?  Laundering his underwear.  Yeah.  A lot of Bin Laden drips.  I think they don't want to, their quandary is this.  They don't want to show the death picture because he probably looks so pathetic.  We might feel bad for him?  Well.  Well, show fucking pictures of people jumping out the building first.  No, I understand.  Show the picture of him dead. 
[01:36:00]  I want the death pictures, but I'm just saying, if he was in his underwear, he's got the sad  gray beard, probably haven't showered in a while, probably just droopy skin in general.  I had a Smithsonian channel on yesterday, and like out of nowhere, I'm just watching  some documentary on fucking planets and stuff like that, and it was kind of cool.  And then, you know how shows don't go to commercial anymore, really?  They just, one show goes right into another show?  Mm-hmm.  That happened, and there's the World Trade Center, and then, and I'm like, motherfucker, 
[01:36:30]  man, ah!  Like, ah!  I know if I'm in that frame of mind where I kind of want to see it in a documentary that's  kind of covering the whole thing, I'm prepared for it and shit, but like, that shit just,  when it's thrust in your face like that, I was, uh, it gave me goosebumps, and I had  to grab the remote real quick and get the fuck out of there. 
[01:37:00]  Tough to see.  I don't like that at all, and that's why I want to see the death pictures, too, because  I really don't give a shit about this motherfucker.  Of course.  I could give a shit if his whole fucking head came off.  Of course.  Because I still, ten years later, get that feeling when it's thrust on you like that.  Right, of course.  We shouldn't be seeing these pictures.  Fuck yeah.  I could, I could handle the planes hitting, handle it, I'm not saying, you know, I could  handle the buildings falling, because that was, that was so amazing.  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  Horrible.  Don't get me wrong, horrible, but so amazing that that could even happen, it's like, what?  But the one thing, and I'll say it again, those fucking people jumping, that's my line.  I can't watch that shit.  Because it becomes something.  I know when the planes hit, killed a lot of people.  I know when they're fucking collapsing, killing a shitload of people, I get all that.  But to see just the individuals one by one jumping, that's where I can't handle it.  Because you start putting yourself in that mindset of what the fuck does it take to have 
[01:38:00]  to do that, and you don't want to, you don't even want to think that for a second, that  you would have to do something like that.  Right.  So yeah, that freaks you out.  But it's also the sound, like, the street-level cameras of the planes flying in, and one building  burning, and then the other plane coming in, and just hearing, like, the screams, and oh  my gods, and holy shit, like, you hear people cursing, and stuff.  Like, that gets me like, fuck, I get so mad again. 
[01:38:30]  And you know, I might piss off some people in America, but hearing New Yorkers say that,  Yeah, yeah, believe me.  Isn't that weird?  Because we were brought up around, you know, we were born in this area, and I did radio  all over the fucking place, but spent most of my time in the New York area, and Long  Island, and all that.  The building had been bombed already once, so it was kind of like, blah, blah, blah.  But to hear that type of reaction from New Yorkers, like, we've talked about it, a guy  can walk down the sidewalk with a knife in his fucking neck, and most people won't even  turn and look, because they've got places to be.  There was a guy last night, we, after Red Eye, we went to, of course, we went to one of 
[01:39:00]  the local gin mills, and had a couple of cocktails, and there was a guy in the middle  of the road that we were on, it was, I don't know, like 48th, something like that, and he's  in the middle of the road with two shopping bags, playing the harmonica.  Nice.  And cars had to go around him, but he's just, but no one stopped, no one asked, are you  okay, what are you doing, do you need help?  Everyone was just walking down the sidewalks, cars were veering around him, and he's just 
[01:39:30]  playing the harmonica in the middle of the road, pacing, back and forth.  It's the weirdest fucking place.  Why don't you film that shit?  You're driving me nuts.  No, I was very, uh, we were actually talking and said, Opie would have filmed that.  Yes.  And I'm just like, ah, Guinness, please.  I can't pass that shit up.  You gotta film that shit, you're driving me nuts.  But that's just it, it's like, no one was filming it, no one was talking to him, and  that's part of like, living around here is the total desensitizing of the outrageous. 
[01:40:00]  I film my stuff mostly for people that don't live in New York, because of what you just  said, most people don't give a fuck.  They don't care enough to pull their cameras out and film it, you're right.  I mean, you gotta be naked, yelling and screaming, Jew, and the N-word on the fucking subway,  and then they'll pull out their cameras, like we showed you the other day.  Ran.  But the other shit, eh.  Yeah.  Nah, it's not important enough.  Not good enough.  Eh, it's just a guy playing the harmonica in the middle of the road.  Speaking of videos, we had those young magicians in yesterday. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  Gotta explain something.  We filmed all the tricks.  The guy turning the dollars into hundreds came out really well, and I made him redo it  for Kenny outside the studio.  The video's worth watching, because Kenny is the worst audience ever for anybody.  We all know that.  He could give a fuck, even though it was pretty amazing to see this up close and try to figure  out how he does it, because obviously it's a trick.  Yeah.  I love the people.  It's a trick.  Obviously, he has the doll.  Yeah, we know.  We know it's a trick.  We weren't amazed by his magical powers. 
[01:41:00]  I'm embarrassed by some of the comments that I see on these videos.  Yeah, we know it's a trick, idiot.  But what you want to do is try to figure out how it's done, because it's pretty fucking  amazing when you see it three feet in front of your face.  Yeah, and things are changing.  When something changes right in front of your face that fast, you're amazed.  Yeah, but you're not thinking for a moment that it's real magic.  It's real magic.  So I filmed that, and I filmed the kid with the balloon and the cell phone, and the kid  did a pretty good job with that trick.  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  And those are both up on my channel, but the other two didn't come out well.  That's why there's no video.  Yeah.  The Asian kid did a hack trick, unfortunately, because he's-  Little foam things that can change sizes, and you could squish a bunch of them in someone's  hand, and they won't even know that there's 10 foamy things in their hand until they open  it.  And it's a shame, because he was the best magician in the documentary.  He was amazing.  But the girl, I could give a shit if she was fucking doing the, look, I'm pulling my thumb 
[01:42:00]  off.  You know the trick?  If she came up to me and said, I got your nose, I'd be like, she's the best magician  ever.  All right.  We can put-  She was probably the hottest thing walking around on the planet.  She was-  She was retarded hot.  She was beautiful, man.  Oh, God.  All right.  You know what?  Then I'll put it up, I guess.  Yeah, you should.  Her acting was bad.  Her acting was terrible.  Magician acting, by the way, is usually pretty bad anyway, but she was over the top. 
[01:42:30]  But she lives in L.A., Malibu.  Of course she does.  You would think she would have taken an acting lesson by now, living out there for her magic.  Just wear a bikini on the beach.  And then her-  I'd like to see her naked.  Yeah.  And then it involved a magazine that was worn.  I was just-  Yeah.  So I figured I can't post that.  But now you're right.  I guess I should have posted just because she's so hot.  Just for the hotness factor.  You've got to post that.  And then they're just going to rip her apart for her bad acting.  For her bad acting and bad turn.  But who cares?  All right.  She's what they call a babe. 
[01:43:00]  You're right.  We'll try to put that up.  In the day.  A babe.  Try to put that up sometime this weekend.  Helmet cam.  You know something?  I was looking at some of these goddamn things down at B&H.  I want to get one of these for my drives.  Because I can't pull the phone out every time I have an altercation because I'm in an altercation.  But I always have altercations.  So if I could strap a fucking camera to my head, it would be unbelievably entertaining.  Why aren't you doing that?  I know it.  But I've got to get one of those.  How big is the helmet cam?  Because I was looking at some... 
[01:43:30]  They're pretty small, man.  I need some fucking undercover cameras.  Do you?  Yeah, I'm going...  Nanny cam?  Something like that?  No, I need one with goofy glasses.  Oh, goofy glasses cam?  Yeah, because I've got some ideas.  But every time you fucking show the HD flip, people, you know, they know...  They clam up.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, you've got to get them in their natural habitat.  But where is that at B&H?  I didn't see that...  I saw that at B&H.  Where do you go?  Upstairs?  No, you go to the consumer video part.  Yeah, I know.  And then, you know the glass case where they have accessories for the consumer video part? 
[01:44:00]  It's like people behind a counter?  Yeah.  You go there.  Why there?  I don't know.  Because they kind of hide them back there.  That's where I got the case, the underwater case for my Canon camera.  Can I get the big, goofy glasses?  I don't know if they got the big, goofy glasses.  I would assume you could buy the goofy glasses with the camera.  And how big is the helmet cam?  Helmet cam is like a little fucking tube, almost, that goes on the side of like a bicycling  helmet.  But you could put it on a headband or a visor or a hat. 
[01:44:30]  How big is that?  You could put it anywhere.  Look, you can see goggles next to it.  Oh, okay.  See, it's small.  This thing is pretty small.  It only weighs like 5.3 ounces, it says there.  And it's very good quality.  Oh, yeah, look.  That's it on a bicycling helmet.  Oh, let the fuck on.  I don't wear a bike helmet.  This one looks pretty sweet.  It's 1080p.  That's pretty sweet.  But I was thinking, I've got to get one of these because I'm constantly yelling at ethnic  cab drivers and saying horrific things to them.  And I think it should be captured on video. 
[01:45:00]  Yes, do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  You could totally mount right on your dash.  Yeah, but the thing is, I want it somewhere on my head.  So when I turn and roll the window down and start yelling at the cabbie.  You get it on a pivot, though.  Yeah, but see, I'm so quick on the draw to turn and start yelling that I couldn't really  turn.  It's got to be my line of sight.  Yeah, I agree with you.  My line of sight.  I would fucking attach to my Yankee hat on my drive home.  I don't care.  I'd clip it right on the side and be like, I'm driving. 
[01:45:30]  Does that thing have clips?  You could probably get an accessory.  I'm sure there's something.  I could give it the presidential solution, as they call it, and rig something.  I just upgraded my fucking camera.  I can't wait to start playing around with it.  Oh, that thing's great.  That Canon thing.  Yeah.  I picked up one of those.  The VU.  What's it called?  The VU.  It starts with a V.  Yeah.  That model.  It's great.  It's ridiculous.  I fucking love it.  HD.  I love it.  Some real deal shit. 
[01:46:00]  That's great.  Look at that fucking thing.  Oh, that's the...  Nice.  Yeah, that's the one for the head.  A couple of hundred bucks.  You're in.  I'm fucking...  I'm yelling at cabbies.  I'm fucking yelling at pedestrians.  Oh, my God.  All right, Dan.  I got to help you out.  Yeah?  I got one of these things.  Go ahead, Cliff.  Hey, it's called the GoPro HD, and it's got a vehicle mount.  You can mount it right to the front of the Mustang.  It's all in HD.  You get like an hour of footage.  Frickin' awesome.  All right, listen.  I have a GoPro, because it's a sporting camera. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Because I do a lot of biking in Central Park, and I had an idea to maybe possibly podcast  for my bike, because I want to do it different than like Ant and other people.  So I figured I have all these stupid thoughts when I'm riding loops in the park.  So I'm like, I'm going to get one of these GoPros, turn it on, fucking talk, and show  what the fuck's going on in the park.  Just let it rip, yeah.  And then edit it into something, and maybe it'll work.  It's just a dumb idea that maybe it will never fly.  The audio on those things, Cliff, suck.  Oh, do they?  Yeah, it does. 
[01:47:00]  See?  So you can't have that.  Can't do that.  It's made...  If you mount it to the front bumper of the Mustang, it looks like a frickin' movie.  He is right.  Oh, that's cool.  These cameras are amazing, because what you do is you, like he said, you put it on the  front of your car, a lot of mountain bikers use them, surfers, you know, all the outdoor  sports.  The video this thing takes is amazing.  He's right.  Yeah.  It looks like a fucking movie.  But I mean, what they need is one where you can get some good audio, too.  Yeah, yeah.  So I can't use mine, because I need to talk through my shit. 
[01:47:30]  Because I'm not doing amazing things on my stupid hybrid bike when I'm doing loops.  All right, punch it out, boys.  I'm going to pick one of these things up.  The helmet cam?  Yeah.  Yeah, I need that.  I need it, too, for the Poconos thing we've got going on.  21st.  Get the...  I'm telling you, get the Pro?  Yeah.  Just for that.  Because that, you don't need audio.  You fucking put that on the front of your bumper, your Mustang, or whatever.  Well, I'm also going to take the little Canon up with me, and...  But I'm telling you, you have the money. 
[01:48:00]  Get one of the...  What is it again?  GoPro?  Yeah, GoPro.  That really is a cool camera for sporting shit, as long as you don't care about the audio.  And it will pick up enough audio if you're on a racetrack.  Taking the Mustang to the track.  You've got to see the video on this thing.  It's really good, Ant.  Bring everything.  Oh.  Yeah, they're totally cool with you recording whatever you want.  Film anything.  That's cool.  I want to get a few cool shots, like the quick, the camera set up right on the side  of the track when you pass by.  And I do want to take the Canon and put it in the middle of the track and go over it. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, nice.  Because that would be a really cool shot, too.  And I think my aim's good enough that I wouldn't fucking crush it.  I might have to go up there.  And if you did.  I might have to.  And if I did, eh, fuck it, I'll get another one.  I might have to go up there, because this is where you kill me.  You see cool shit, too, and you're not fucking filming it, man.  Oh, no, I'm going to film the shit out of this.  Believe me, this one's getting fucking a lot of coverage.  And helmet cam, too, which will be fucking cool as shit.  Really, listen to me, though.  Get the GoPro.  It's just, you throw that on your car.  Right on the front.  And forget about it, because it'll film everything. 
[01:49:00]  That's cool.  And then use your other cameras for all that other stuff.  I'm telling you, you'll have a great video.  Nice.  All right.  Jim Jeffries has sat down.  We're going to take a break.  We've been talking for an hour and a half, Jim.  He's just waking up.  I can see you in your face.  Ah, yeah.  All right, we all.  Jim Jeffries will be at Caroline's all weekend, and we'll talk to him next.  212-757-4100 for tickets, if they're even available at this point.  I'd be surprised if they are.  We'll continue.  The virus.  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:49:30]  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com.  Opie and Anthony.  Roger Daltrey.  Wow.  Taking Tommy on U.S. tour.  What?  Yeah.  Again?  What the fuck?  Is it just him by himself?  Oh, wow.  Really?  He got Pete's approval.  He got Pete's approval.  He's probably like, Pete, I want to do this.  Oh, I'm not sure. 
[01:50:00]  Pete, right?  Most of it?  Oh, well, you want me to fucking...  Yeah, you run all of it.  I got your hard drive here.  Can I do this?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, mate.  I got your hard drive.  That was an obscure old reference, but a good one.  How the fuck did you get away with that one?  Well, my friend has a routine about that, which is always the whole idea that he said, oh,  I was writing a book about it.  Yeah, so he was researching.  Because everyone's heard what the doctors have done, and everyone's heard what, let's  hear what the rock gods have to say.  He's researching. 
[01:50:30]  He got away with it, man.  He knew some people.  He called in some favors.  That's a biggie over there in England, isn't it?  Well, it's also the fact that people were going, oh, I'm friends with him, and I'm sure he's  not a pedophile.  Yeah.  Are we sure that anyone's not?  You know what I mean?  Like, I'm friends with a lot of people, and I've never officially met a pedophile.  Right, right.  I assume that I know some.  You probably know some, but it's like, wait a minute.  But I've never officially met one.  Yeah, he never pulled me aside and go, hey, check this picture out, you know? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, it's always very clandestine.  And, yeah, Roger Daltrey, or Pete Townsend got away with it, but then you look at Gary  Glitter, I guess his lawyer wasn't as good.  Well, no, see, Gary Glitter kept on pushing the argument, though.  Gary Glitter got away with it, and then, oh, got away with it, off to Thailand on holiday.  Why do we have to get rid of the great song, though, that we hear?  Come on, come on.  Actually, at every sporting event, you do the fucking rock and roll part one.  They brought it back. 
[01:51:30]  They did bring it back.  Yes.  Oh, they just changed the name or something, right?  Yeah, they called it, like, Stadium Song or something like that.  You sure they brought it back?  Yes.  Yes.  I thought that you guys never lost it.  We always used to laugh about that in Europe.  Yeah.  It was like a big thing that you guys, when you got excited.  No, they got rid of it for a while.  After he pulled those shenanigans with the kiddie porn, they weren't using it anymore.  It wasn't just kiddie porn in the end.  Oh, no, he was fucking kids in Thailand.  Yeah.  I like how the way he got caught was there wasn't an investigation. 
[01:52:00]  His laptop started to get a few viruses in it, so he took it in for repairs.  What a dummy.  Yeah, that happens when you look at a lot of porn.  Why do you think I have a Mac?  Right.  Actual children fell out of his computer.  New children.  Yeah, if you're a pedophile, you should be throwing away your computers like you do your old socks.  Why would you ever bring it in for repairs?  What's wrong with you?  You just shove it in a fucking MRI machine and crank it up.  That should be the price of doing kids. 
[01:52:30]  That's the price of doing kids.  One laptop every fucking six months to a year.  You're accountants.  You're going through a lot of laptops.  Yeah.  Believe me, it's a lot cheaper than the alternative.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Being an old rocker, you know, you really got to get through this.  You know, me and Ann are convinced.  And who was in recently talking about Thailand?  Oh, the guy from Hangover 2.  Yeah, yes.  By the way, I guess we were supposed to beat that guy up because he had a bad experience with Ron.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah.  I heard about that, but it was after the fact. 
[01:53:00]  Justin Barthor.  Justin, yeah.  Justin Barthor.  He seemed quite nice to me.  I thought he came across nice, and I guess Ronnie had a tough time with him, right?  I don't know.  He was promoting National Treasure.  This is what I got off.  And Ron turned it around, and they got along.  Oh, okay.  But I have no idea.  Well, fuck, and you know, we almost got bad info.  I know, yeah.  If you could listen to the whole Ron interview, you would think that they had a bad time,  and we were supposed to beat him up.  Ronnie could take care of his own problems.  Oh, please.  Ronnie doesn't need any help. 
[01:53:30]  Man's a mercenary.  And I do remember listening to that interview.  It was National Treasure, and I remember it got really fucking weird.  But I think I didn't make it to the end where they turned it around either.  Oh, why did it get weird?  What got weird about it?  How did he get into an argument about National Treasure?  Yeah, really?  That film wasn't very realistic.  What are you saying to me?  I'm not going to speak out of turn, because I don't know exactly.  I just remember it got...  Telling tales out of school?  Yeah.  It got just a little weird.  Right, Sam?  Yeah.  How did it get weird?  That's all I want to know, is like, what was the vibe that wasn't good? 
[01:54:00]  If he's the guy I'm thinking of, I remember the interview, it was a few years ago, so it  made sense, because Ron was commenting on him being young, and he would have been...  You have the clip?  He was young in that movie, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you got the clip?  Look at this shit.  Yeah, it's about three minutes, but I think it starts almost immediately.  Oh, okay.  I didn't make the connection that I was the guy.  Me neither.  Until after, and I was checking my Twitter.  He waited a long time, though.  He waited a long time?  Us or Ronnie?  Ron and Phil.  But that just happens.  I don't know how to tell people. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, no, no.  There was an hour, though.  Yeah, but some talk shows you fly all the way in from L.A., and they bump you.  He must have gotten there.  Because Letterman wants to do a longer bit or something.  Sometimes you buy a hooker, and she's just not there.  It doesn't show up.  There's just no one to complain to.  They're not unionized properly.  No.  He must have gotten there early, because Ron does his interview.  No, Ron.  He's like clockwork.  Yeah, Ron doesn't fuck around with that shit.  But the other producer.  Yeah.  Hello.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl messed up.  Oh, Earl messed up.  Earl messed up.  Of course it was Earl. 
[01:55:00]  Because in general, we don't like people to wait ever.  But, I mean, sometimes we might be into something that's working, and you sacrifice a guest maybe  waiting a little longer.  That's the only time, but we don't do it on purpose to fuck with the guy.  I'd love to hear this awkwardness.  All right.  We got a guest coming in, Fez.  That's right.  It's Justin Bartha.  He is going to appear in National Treasure 2, Book of Secrets.  That's opening nationwide Friday, December 21st, co-starring Nicholas Cage. 
[01:55:30]  You can go to nationaltreasure.com for more information.  Who's this guy talking, by the way?  Here comes Justin in right now.  How you doing, man?  I'm good, man.  Congratulations.  Congratulations to you.  Congratulations.  Thanks.  Love, Ronnie.  You're here in New York City on an ugly day.  It's a beautiful day.  Yeah.  This is going to be an easy one with Justin.  Are you picking up for that?  Yeah.  He doesn't seem to be arguing every point.  Jesus Christ.  Just get into the studio. 
[01:56:00]  Call brain and say good work.  Okay.  Yeah.  Justin's here.  Brand new movie out.  And it's...  It's a good movie.  It's a fun movie, I got to say.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I promise you this.  You'll have a good time.  Yeah.  That's what they pay me to say.  So, the last time the National Treasure was about what?  Oh, thanks for watching the movie.  It was about...  Wow.  I don't know why this fucking guy came in here with his... 
[01:56:30]  Pause this.  Wow.  This is the one being the cock.  Whoa, man.  Did you hear him say about his coat?  Nobody would take his coat?  I remember Ron specifically mentioning that he got pissed off because he walked in and said,  I just got here and nobody's taking my coat for me.  Really?  Yeah.  He said it in that clip.  No one's taking my coat today either.  Roland's moving his head back and forth.  Listen, we had a good time with Justin Barth.  I didn't get a feeling that he was a douche like he's coming across in this clip, certainly.  I will...  I don't know...  Maybe it's the environment he walked into. 
[01:57:00]  I will tell you something, though.  But Ronnie has nothing to do with it.  No.  Ronnie was being a...  But sometimes you can act like a bit of an asshole and you have to check yourself afterwards.  Yeah, yeah.  There's plenty of times in my life where I've gone, I was the cunt in this place.  Oh, I was the asshole.  Shit.  I'm amazed it's the same guy.  Dude, dude, but...  Now, I was...  Yesterday, during the interview, there were a couple of instances where he really wasn't  elaborating much on something.  Like, his answers were very short and you're left...  Like, you were waiting for a longer answer to maybe come up with the next question. 
[01:57:30]  So there was a little gap there where it was a little nervous for a second.  Like, uh-oh, is this going to be like...  Yeah.  This guy's not really talking.  But then we just kept talking about other things.  Then we started talking about our own fucking lives and showing...  And he joined in and it was all fun.  But you could tell, like, when Ronnie said, oh, this is going to be an easy one, it was  because he just said, it's a beautiful day.  And then it was over.  He was also young here, so maybe since this movie, publicity...  Young, dumb, and full of cum?  Exactly.  Yeah, yes, Sam. 
[01:58:00]  Well, shape up.  Why didn't he go to Norton yesterday?  Thanks for seeing the movie.  Because Norton openly admitted he didn't see Hangover.  Because maybe now he's been told.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck around in the interview.  And secondly, I'm not going to trash the guy.  We had a good time with him.  We really did.  But I didn't feel a problem with him.  No, this isn't a trash at all.  But this is really interesting to hear, you know, the same guy on Ronnie's show from a  few years ago.  I love the set of balls on Ronnie, too.  And I'm sure Ronnie had every right to do what he did, obviously.  So much fun to listen to.  I would love to know his side of the story and what made him all pissy when he came in.  But Hangover 2 doesn't need any promotion. 
[01:58:30]  It's going to do fucking ridiculous numbers.  So we kind of blew off the movie, really, yesterday.  We were probably talking about prostitutes in Thailand.  Yeah, Thailand.  That was the extent of it.  And the movie takes place in Thailand.  So it was relevant to the movie.  And the guy was in Thailand.  So he was able to talk about some of the sex shit that goes on.  That's what made it good.  But I think what tipped well out was...  I had sex.  They never got AIDS.  It's fucking great.  I just like to bring it up.  And you know.  I'm invincible.  You just had the fucking test done.  No AIDS.  What I love about that story, you know now. 
[01:59:00]  I know now.  Yeah, yeah.  Like 10 years later, you finally go, oh.  I've been losing hair for years about it.  I mean, I'm telling you, straight down.  My AIDS says, one time I sort of, as an AIDS test in my mind, there was a girl that I used  to shag.  And I really used to fuck her in every hole, this bird.  And then she left me and started dating another guy.  And she had a kid.  And I'm like, they must test them before the kid comes out.  Oh, so you're hoping other people get tested.  And since you haven't gotten a phone call.  Yeah, see, the thing is, if she's had a child with no complication, if I had AIDS, she had 
[01:59:30]  AIDS.  Like, it's not a foolproof method.  There'd be some doctors who would frown, but I think I'm correct.  Well, I don't think it's a guarantee that if you had AIDS and had sex with her, that  she was going to get AIDS.  There's riskier sex than that, where you're fucking her in the ass and shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And cutting her.  And cutting her.  Cutting her.  Jesus.  I was coming in her open wounds.  Jesus. 
[02:00:00]  Cutting her.  What the fuck?  Let's go back to Justin Barthol from a few years back on Ron and Fez.  Same guy we had in yesterday.  Had a good time with.  You backed it up a little bit, Travis?  He had a problem with.  Slightly.  On the Ron and Fez show, though.  Yeah, that's years ago.  The rest of this clip, it's great.  So, the last time the National Treasure was about what?  Thanks for watching the movie.  It was about.  I don't know why this fucking guy came in here with his attitude.  I don't understand.  It's almost behind enemy lines for you, brother. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, my God.  This is not one.  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  What makes we're more interesting radio than Conflict?  For how?  We were having fucking interesting radio.  You're invited to come in and plug your movie.  You can.  I'm going to do that right now.  Yeah.  Okay.  But if you want to come in here and hang out with us and talk, you can do that.  I thought we were all just having fun and joking around.  We were having fun and joking around before you came in.  Ooh.  And, you know, you could take your coat off outside, too. 
[02:01:00]  Take fucking seven minutes to take a coat off inside.  Dave.  Wow.  It's funny.  There's a fucking show going on.  I didn't realize that I was going to be like this, guys.  I just got in.  I'm sorry.  Well, I mean, you came in with the man right off the bat.  With the man?  Yeah.  What does that mean?  You came in with attitude.  Ah.  Well, I was just joking around.  It wasn't a serious attitude.  I thought that's what this kind of show was.  Ooh.  So you'd have...  Oh, well, thanks for listening to the show, folks. 
[02:01:30]  Well, I mean, I didn't see your movie, and you acted like somehow I fucking let you down.  I was just joking.  I didn't expect you to see the movie.  You didn't let me down.  You didn't let me down at all.  Ooh.  Oh, my God.  Would you like...  Can we start over?  Can I apologize for that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is uncomfortable.  I'm sorry, guys.  I didn't mean to have an attitude with you at all.  Love it.  Fucking love it.  I'll tell you what.  I'm not saying National Treasure now.  Okay.  So tell us all about your movie.  Okay.  It's a sequel to National Treasure, which is a movie that came out a few years ago, and it's 
[02:02:00]  starring Nicolas Cage, and it's a treasure hunting movie.  It's an adventure movie in the spirit of Indiana Jones.  All right.  Now, I did see the first one, and that one was all about Philadelphia, right?  It took place a lot in Philadelphia, yeah.  So this one, what happens?  Well, we go international.  In this one, we go to London and Paris, and it's a lot bigger in scope, a lot more action, 
[02:02:30]  a lot more adventure.  All right.  Oh, this is so funny.  Yeah, we're not going to be able to get over this, are we?  What's the two-pass feel?  Not at all.  I'm having a great time.  Fucking Ronnie.  That fucking rules.  I have the next minute and a half if you want it.  It's a separate clip.  I don't know what happens.  Holy shit.  That fucking Ronnie rules.  I completely...  His voice is condescending as fucking it.  Yeah, he's like, now we've got a thing.  That's great.  Hey, I was just joking around. 
[02:03:00]  I completely remember this now.  I didn't realize it was the same guy.  I didn't know what type of show this was.  I think Ronnie is probably the most honest motherfucker ever to be in any entertainment medium.  For him to just go, yeah, we're not going to be able to get over this.  It's a great moment.  Holy shit.  Fantastic.  Of course I want to hear at least the beginning of the next clip.  It's a great moment.  Just in case...  How much do you miss Eastside Dave here?  I know.  How much do you miss the fucking guy?  You take your coat off outside. 
[02:03:30]  What's fucking wrong with you?  I know Ronnie's got some good guys around him now, but fuck.  Eastside Dave.  I'm not trashing anyone else that's on that show.  That's great.  That Eastside Dave shit is fucking gold.  What's Dave's website?  We ought to plug it, too.  Eastside Dave country?  Eastside Dave country?  He does videos that fucking make me laugh my balls off.  Absolutely.  And I'm not sure if they're genuinely funny or they're funny because I know Dave.  I can't figure it out.  Maybe you think they're funny because you think Dave is really cute. 
[02:04:00]  Dave's cute?  Is it because Dave's hot and has blonde hair and puts a banana on his face?  I caught so much shit for that yesterday.  Someone wanted me to turn you on to another girl that does videos like that.  Goofy cute with the one with the big boobs.  Is she the one that does like a cat sometimes?  The Japanese word of the day or something?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  You know that one?  I've seen her.  I've seen her before.  You like her, too?  She's not as goofy.  She does the Japanese word for the one I saw, exercise, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then she does fucking push-ups and shit. 
[02:04:30]  And she's into Hello Kitty stuff and things like that.  Yeah, I've seen her before.  Not as good?  No, not as good.  That blonde is fucking great.  Right.  I like that blonde chick.  And by the way, a lot of people were tweeting her saying that we were talking about her.  And she goes, oh, she commented.  And she said something like, I love you guys or something.  So me and Jimmy.  Me and Jimmy's name was up there.  And then Jimmy fucking tweets like, oh, just love me a little more than Anthony.  It's like, oh, now you're coming around, you cock? 
[02:05:00]  Fucking Norton, man.  Fucking Norton.  She didn't even mention me?  Nah, you were really being harsh on her, I think.  What the fuck?  I wasn't being harsh on her.  Jimmy was being fucking the prick.  He was the cock blocker.  The second the radar, the second we were on her radar, Jimmy turned around and fucking was like,  hey, love me a little more than Anthony.  Motherfucking Jimmy Norton, huh?  Fucking Jimmy Norton. 
[02:05:30]  Motherfucker.  You motherfucker Jimmy Norton.  People out there in Twitter land are confused.  Roger Daltrey was not the pedophile.  No.  Wow, we don't know.  We don't even know if Pete Townsend was because he got away with it.  But people are confused that Roger Daltrey was the one that had problems with the computer.  No, my friends.  That was Pete Townsend.  Do not make that mistake.  Roger was very careful about his pornography.  They're doing Tommy, which is outdated.  Yeah, isn't that kind of a... 
[02:06:00]  It's even just hard.  I'm into pinball.  It's hard to buy one.  Well, no, it's happening.  There's a trend in music now where these bands are going out and just playing one album.  Yeah.  All the way through.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's becoming kind of a thing.  Is he going to update it like, I'm an angry bird wizard?  Wizard, there has to be a twister.  Angry bird wizard.  It's like, just kind of updated to the new games.  I just bought a pinball machine. 
[02:06:30]  You did?  Yeah, I fucking love pinball.  I love pinball.  It's fun.  I love it too, man.  I love it.  There's only one company that still makes them stern out of Chicago, man.  It's fucking great.  Yeah, all the other ones shut down.  Only one left in the world.  And they've just got a Tron one that's just been announced yesterday.  I look at it on the internet.  Neutron?  Neutron pinball machine that looks pretty fucking shit hot.  My favorite fucking pinball machine ever was at any W.  That goddamn Terminator game was great.  Oh, I thought you were going my direction. 
[02:07:00]  What?  Oh, the Rolling Stones one?  The vintage Rolling Stones pinball machine?  The pinball machine sucks.  That sucks.  It's so old.  There's a brand new Rolling Stone one, which was the last one they brought out before Tron,  which has like a little moving Mick Jagger, but that sucks balls as well.  I got Spider-Man.  But the best machines are the Twilight Zone, Adam's Family, and Medieval Madness are your best three.  Oh, I got to get that pinball machine.  That I want in my fucking bar.  That was one of the best fucking machines ever, the Terminator fucking pinball. 
[02:07:30]  Terminator 3 is better than that one.  Is it?  Really?  It's a better machine, yeah.  Terminator 3.  It has the guns and it has the thing in it.  Get the CPU.  In the back glass where it goes up and down.  I love that one.  Get the CPU.  Run.  Run.  We have to get the ball around and fucking run.  Jim Jeffries in the studio.  I love the Rolling Stone vintage pinball machine so much.  It's got a beautiful back glass, but it's a shit guy.  You know what?  It broke nicely when I took a sledgehammer to it.  Yeah, you took a sledgehammer to it.  I had some old school Rolling Stone fans and gamers that wanted my fucking head. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  They were pissed that I took a sledgehammer to this fucking thing.  What's that going for?  $3,600?  It's collector's quality.  So why don't you get one for your basement?  I am.  Get the Terminator 3.  Terminator 3 is better?  Terminator 3 is a better one.  Dude, it better be better because I loved the fucking Judgment Day one.  It was great.  Terminator 2.  Pull out your credit card and buy it right now.  That's perfect for you.  Buy that, bitch.  Your bar area.  I can never enjoy or purchase. 
[02:08:30]  I'm about to purchase a pinball machine, but I can never purchase a pinball machine up for  a movie that I didn't like.  I would never be able to have a Terminator 3 pinball game ever.  The thing is, the pinball machines hold their value.  You buy one, they're the same.  As long as they keep in good shape, I would gather.  It depends what one you get.  That one will hold.  It's about $3,600.  But it would have been like $3,000 brand new in its day.  But don't you need a mechanic?  Yeah.  No, no.  I've got a...  I mean, how the fuck do you fix it?  I've got a guy. 
[02:09:00]  You've got a guy.  You've got a guy.  You've got a guy.  You've got a guy.  I've got a guy.  We all have a guy.  That's all you need.  My guy's Kevin Dillon's personal assistant.  Oh, really?  As long as you've got a guy.  Terminator 3.  People say it is correct.  That's the greatest pinball machine.  The one you talked about.  See, man.  From any W days.  I know.  Your one's a more classic one, but that one's better play.  I've got to play the Terminator 3.  I haven't played that one.  But playing Terminator 2, it was one of the best playing games.  There was so much shit going on in that fucking game. 
[02:09:30]  It was great.  Hey, and our old pals are on MSNBC right now.  Remember Matt and Trey when they used to do our show all the time and no one knew who  the fuck South Park was?  What are they doing?  They're doing the Book of Mormon.  Oh, right.  Book of Mormon.  They're the Book of Mormon guys.  14 Tony nominations.  How the fuck did the South Park guys get 14 Tony nominations?  Because they're...  Come on.  Seriously?  They're amazing.  They're very talented.  It's nice to see other people getting gray, huh?  A little bit, right?  Wow. 
[02:10:00]  A little bit.  Sorry, we're still doing that.  And what you think with that South Park money,  they might...  The one guy there might...  Get some medicine or some follicles.  Get some follicles.  You got South Park money.  Take care of that shit.  Matt and Trey.  Yeah.  It is the thing.  If I didn't want to be an actor or something,  my hair could go to shit.  You wouldn't give a shit, right?  The more money I make, the more women I sleep with.  It doesn't really come down to looks...  To the hair or anything.  This is the whole thing that they think that...  When I was 20, I was the best looking I'd been in my life.  And women who were 20 wouldn't fuck me because they'd call me immature 
[02:10:30]  because I'd live with my parents or something like that.  Right now, I haven't matured a fucking day in my life.  You might have went backwards.  I am the ugliest I have ever been.  But my bank account's at its highest.  And I'm fucking the best looking woman in my life.  And now you are.  You are the man.  I fucked someone the other day that was born in the 90s.  That's ridiculous.  Fantastic, right?  Yeah, but it's such a vivid era for me, the 90s.  Yeah, vivid.  It doesn't even fucking...  You remember doing things like when that girl was born. 
[02:11:00]  Like fucking other people.  Right, right.  When she was born.  Yeah, yeah.  When she was born.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow, that's crazy.  And you feel like you're doing something illegal.  Like that girl didn't know what a cassette was.  You know, it was just that level of really...  I literally once had to check on state laws.  Yeah.  I had to check with one girl on a state law.  Turns out you can't punch any of them.  And the fucked up thing, and I've said this before, 
[02:11:30]  if a girl is 17, let's say, and she's in New York State,  you can have sex with her, no matter what your age is.  Right.  Age of consent.  Yeah.  But you can't show her any type of nudity or pornography.  No.  On a computer, and you can't photograph her.  But you could take her to bed, and fuck the shit out of her.  Yeah.  But don't let her see any nudity around in photographs.  No, I agree with that.  I...  Hey, believe me.  I'd rather have the fucking part than going through a photo album. 
[02:12:00]  16 in Australia, across the board.  All right, I'm moving, officially.  I'm renouncing my patriotism.  This is what I always say, because America, I think,  is the only country that has the 21 drinking age.  And every time you have that debate with someone,  when they talk about it, everyone else in the world has 18,  everyone always uses this example.  They always go, if you can send someone to war with a gun,  as they're being fired on, at least the person can have a beer, right?  Yeah.  No. 
[02:12:30]  Throw that fucking argument out the window.  Also, if you can be gang-banged by eight black guys,  give that girl a beer.  Legally.  Legally.  You can be banged.  At 18, you can have 15 guys come on your face at once.  I think she's going to need more than just a beer.  Give that girl a shot of tequila.  Just for the pain.  Just for the pain alone.  She deserves it.  Hey, can we finish up the Ronnie thing?  I'm a little obsessed with that.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I know we're getting tons of stuff, which is great.  Yeah.  Plus, we have Ian in his, as Danny writes,  I'm sorry to throw you to the boss, 
[02:13:00]  but I love the word, and I can't take credit for it.  Oh, trollops.  I love the word.  Ian in his trollops.  Sorry, Ian.  His trollops.  Don't you guys ever use that word?  No.  Rarely.  Oh, my mum throws that word out like it's no one's business.  She's a trollopist.  She goes, you bring that trollop over to this house one more time.  It sounds better with the accent.  I eat trollops.  It's Brendan and trollops.  I love it.  It is a good one.  Oh, I thought everyone used it.  I'm bringing it back to you.  That's good.  Yeah.  I think with this accent, I can actually call a trollop a trollop to her face, 
[02:13:30]  and she'll think it's charming.  That one is ripe for bringing back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're right.  All right, back to Ronnie.  So there's another clip we don't even know.  Yeah.  But Justin Bartha, who we had a pretty good time with yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  It was great.  Hangover 2 is coming out soon.  Yeah.  He was barely in the first one, let's be honest with each other.  Maybe he'll be in this one more.  I had a tough time with Ronnie when he was promoting National Treasure 2.  Yeah.  And here's one more clip, quick.  So the last time the National Treasure was about what?  Treasure.  Thanks for watching the movie. 
[02:14:00]  It was about...  I don't know why this fucking guy came in here with his attitude.  You know, it just might have been cut for another show.  Right, right.  Just give her a shout-out.  That's all right.  It was fun to listen to again anyway.  Yeah, we...  I don't know why this fucking guy...  Fucking Ronnie.  He's great.  Don't fucking do that to Ronnie.  Ah.  He's usually pretty cool under pressure.  He is.  He was great.  Don't fuck with him.  And like I was saying, Eastside Dave, hearing him in that clip is great.  And his videos, he's insane. 
[02:14:30]  You see the one on the beach?  I saw the one on the beach.  Playing the guitar?  I saw the one on the beach.  I saw this...  When he does this fucking house, this old house.  I'm Dave Vila.  Vila.  He's the fucking...  He's out of his mind.  He should be making money.  And, yeah.  Stupid he's not.  He makes those...  Oh, I remember him.  He's the guy who ate shit in front of us.  Yes.  He wiped his ass with a bit of toilet paper, then put it in his mouth and ran around.  And that's why he's not making money.  Could you crank the sound up just so I could hear what he's saying on this one? 
[02:15:00]  Hello.  I'm David McDonald.  And welcome to my website.  Welcome to my website.  He's jumping around his yard.  Like a mental patient.  He has a lovely yard.  He's crazy.  He's nuts.  The guy is insane.  So what is his actual occupation?  Unemployed.  I don't know.  He does...  He's doing shitty radio.  Is it an AM radio, is it?  I don't know.  It's a cracking looking webpage. 
[02:15:30]  But it is a good looking webpage.  Absolutely.  Very cool.  He's doing shitty radio.  Frames are making a big comeback.  Frames.  It's all frames.  Where he can't be crazy.  He's got to play straight on the radio.  Yeah.  So he does all his insanity on these videos.  And once again, the company just didn't feel like giving him a raise, which was, in the  end, nothing.  No one would even notice if he got a raise.  That's how little he wanted.  I know.  And they wouldn't give it to him, so he had to leave.  I don't understand that at all. 
[02:16:00]  He couldn't afford to come here anymore.  So he was asking for a raise basically to cover expenses so he could afford to come  here.  And they said no.  And when management can't see that that is a talent that should be on the show, you  know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like they don't know enough about the show to realize he is the fucking guy.  No, they must not.  No.  Or they would have been, he's definitely worth giving extra money to.  I was just talking to someone that's been here, how long did they say?  Six years, I think? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  He hasn't had a raise in six years.  His job title changed where he has way more responsibilities.  You know this person I'm talking to.  I can't throw him under a bus.  But they refused to change his job title because if they do that, then they'll be forced to  give him more money.  So he's making the same exact money even though he has way more responsibilities and his job  title actually would be different.  Because their philosophy is, we all know what the philosophy is around here.  Pay one guy.  Pay one guy.  That's their philosophy. 
[02:17:00]  And I'm not, you know, if you think it's going to work for you, fine.  And I'm not even bitching about Howard because if we could get that deal, we would fucking  take it in a second.  Of course.  But that's their philosophy.  But the thing is, their philosophy is also, if you don't like it, leave.  We'll just get somebody else in here for the same money or less money.  But they don't understand that you can't do that with talent.  Okay.  It's like, you could do it with somebody that's in sales.  I understand.  Somebody that's fucking doing some of the billing things.  Whatever.  But you can't take an on-air guy, especially like Dave, that was just hysterical, funny, 
[02:17:30]  people loved him, and use that same formula that we're just going to, well, leave.  We'll get someone else.  You can't just come up with another guy like that.  Well, and with that said, you know, we've been in this building over two years now.  We've seen people leave.  Yeah.  And the people replacing them, it's a lower level.  And that's why we have a bathroom that is...  That looks like monkeys are in there throwing shit against the wall.  Because they're basically hiring...  That's what they're hiring.  They're basically hiring monkeys now. 
[02:18:00]  Jesus Christ.  And I'm not talking about the, you know, I'm not going racist with this.  I'm just saying...  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  Intellectual.  Intellectual.  Intellectual.  We are...  No, I mean, yeah.  They're like apes going into the bathroom.  We were talking about that earlier.  Just shitting.  Yeah, yeah.  And like, not even flushing.  And I understand you don't want to touch the flushing thing, but use your foot.  Like, just...  How do you walk out of a stall with a big load of shit left in the bowl?  Between me and you, they offered me a radio thing, and I just sort of... 
[02:18:30]  Here?  Yeah, the money was so appalling.  Oh, it's an insult.  That I went and did a podcast, and I'm earning double that for my living room.  Right.  Why wouldn't you...  So why wouldn't you do that?  You're absolutely right.  Yeah, yeah.  Good for you.  There's no surprises here.  That's where we're heading.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  That's where we're heading.  Gearing up.  Either together, separately, or a little of both.  I don't know, but that's where we're heading.  Gearing up.  Because it's not going to make sense at the end of this contract to continue doing it this way. 
[02:19:00]  You can be guessing my one.  Huh?  That's fine.  We're heading that way because they don't respect us.  We haven't had a raise in three years.  Yeah.  And we've grown the audience, certainly.  Our agent had to come out of the last negotiation we had months back, beat to shit just to keep  the status quo.  I mean, really.  And he had to fight like a motherfucker.  Just to get us where we were.  And it's like, please.  It was so insulting. 
[02:19:30]  I don't even know why we walked in this building.  And why?  Because you got to hear, well, everybody, everybody's taking a cut.  Yeah, everybody.  Not us, motherfucker.  We took our cut already.  Yeah.  But then they wanted us to take it down another, to about 40% of where we were.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  So we know where we're heading.  There's no, you know, disillusions here.  Oh, please.  I'm not continuing under these circumstances.  No fucking way.  I probably got $300,000 of broadcasting equipment in my basement at this point.  And it's, and I'm having a guy come in and putting light, he's putting lighting trusses 
[02:20:00]  in that room in the studio now so I could hang the lights and don't have to have them  on light poles anymore.  Right.  This is going to be just fucking ridiculous looking.  Yeah.  He's ready to go.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking A.  You two breaking up.  Is that what you're telling me?  No.  No.  It's one of those deals where it's like fucking.  No, the Opie and Anthony brand is what it is.  Yeah.  We'll figure out what that means next, but, you know.  We'll be on monitors from our own houses just looking at each other.  Hey.  It can't continue this way.  It just can't.  That's what they do with Bob and Tom show in LA. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's a.  I can't live in Seattle on a fucking.  He's on a TV set.  No, he lives in an island off Seattle.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Not even like in Seattle, like in a lighthouse or some shit.  That's awesome.  So he doesn't leave?  Yeah.  You just hear him through the thing.  Hey, Jim.  Good to have you on the show, Jim.  Is there a visual on him?  They don't even have a visual?  They don't Skype or anything?  There's not even a fucking camera in the camera.  There's nothing.  Why do you do that?  I didn't know who he was.  I went and did that.  Wait, Bob and Tom or Kevin and Bean?  Kevin and Bean.  Kevin and Bean, right?  Kevin and Bean, yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Kevin and Bean.  They do it that way.  They haven't seen each other in person in years.  They see each other maybe a couple times a year.  I saw them both together because we did the Gibson Ampli Theater gig.  Me and Bill Burr and Doug Benson, if yours.  We did this gig for charity out there.  And they sort of were getting reacquainted with each other.  Oh, you've lost weight.  Oh, Jesus.  And they do a show every day.  Every day.  Every day with each other.  Fuck.  Wow, yeah.  How did he swing that?  Like, how do you go to your boss and say, look, I just want to stay home and I'll still 
[02:21:30]  do the show.  And how do they go like, no.  Why don't they say, no, you got to fucking be here.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they got, you know, they got their feet planted nice out there.  I'd love to stay home.  Of course.  I would do it from my bed.  I would have a studio rigged up where on my night table is a mic stand.  And I would swing it in front of my face, laying in bed.  Yeah.  I would do stand-up comedy from my bed. 
[02:22:00]  If I could just have like a little garage door that I pull up and the audience is there.  And I'm going, sleeping in, what's all that about?  Can I?  That's brilliant.  You should just do that.  Sleeping in, what's that all about?  You should just, you should sell that as the latest tour you want to do from your living  room where these comedy clubs actually have to just put a screen up and do it.  Oh, that's fucking great.  I bet you some of those fucking comedy club owners would go with it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You want, getting back to Super Agent Bob. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Bob Eatman.  Bab.  I apologize, Bob, if you're listening today.  Don't, don't, don't talk about that.  Oh, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  Okay.  I'm not.  That thing.  I doubt he's listening because I think he only catches us every once in a while.  Yeah.  Doesn't he kind of look like Henry Winkler's corpse?  Oh, right.  Holy shit.  Hey.  Fonzie, the least cool human that's ever lived.  Ever.  Ever.  Oh, I'm a, whatever, I'm a 32-year-old man that lives in a studio in Milwaukee in suburbia. 
[02:23:00]  Upstairs.  I hang out with kids at a milk bar.  And when I see them, I say, come into the toilet with me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's, he's the coolest guy.  He's the coolest guy.  First of all, I don't know if there's a cool person that lives in Milwaukee.  So, right.  Who's the 35-year-old retard hanging out with a ginger kid?  The loser.  You're going, hey, Mrs. I used to be a biker, now I do nothing. 
[02:23:30]  And he's always threatening violence, but you've never seen him fight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you're allowed to have one ginger friend, but if you have two, then people start looking  at you like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, Ralph Malfe, right?  Ralph Malfe.  You can have one.  Richie and Ralph.  And then when you've got one brunette friend and he's called Potsy.  You know.  Potsy.  That's the weird thing about Happy Days.  I remember watching it religiously as a kid.  I don't remember, and enjoying it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember ever once laughing at Happy Days. 
[02:24:00]  I don't remember Happy Days.  So why did we enjoy watching it?  I don't know.  You're right.  I don't, I've never laughed at that shit.  You look at my birthday pictures when I was eight.  Me and my friends are all Fonz-ing up in the picture.  Like we're all like, got the thumbs up.  Yeah, yeah.  When we were eight around the cake going, hey.  You know what I mean?  Fonz-ing it up.  Fonz-ing it up.  Nice.  And you just go, but I don't remember anyone ever sitting there going, oh, ho, ho.  Mrs. Cunningham, stop it.  You're killing me.  That's so fucking true.  Nothing, nothing funny happened.  I don't know if this myth is true, but when they had this spinoff, Joanie versus Chocci. 
[02:24:30]  Versus Chocci.  No, Joanie versus.  Joanie loves Chocci.  And that was the fourth or fifth episode when there was domestic violence, Joanie versus.  But anyway, when it was Joanie loves Chocci, they reckon to this day it's still the number  one most watched pilot of all time in either Japan or China or some Asian country.  Wow, really?  Because the word Chocci means penis.  Oh, right, right, right.  I don't know if it's Joanie loves penis.  Joanie loves cocks.  Joanie loves cocks.  Yeah, yeah.  And they thought it was going to be something completely different, some anime looking bitching. 
[02:25:00]  Instead of that horse shit.  Yeah, instead of that garbage.  But do you like the visual on Super Asian Pop even?  Yeah.  Fonzie's corpse.  Henry Winkler.  It has to be Henry Winkler.  Yeah, it is Henry Winkler.  When you see him out of the Fonzie character.  Have you ever seen the Bronze Fonz in Milwaukee?  They have a Bronze Fonz?  It's a statue of Fonzie that's on the river called the Bronze Fonz and it's life-sized  and he is going, hey.  Well, he made that city, man.  Is that it? 
[02:25:30]  That's it?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow, they shine that fucker up nice, don't they?  The thing is, when you're drunk and you walk past it, you could easily start a fight  with that.  Wow, that's creepy, man.  Yeah, it's extremely creepy.  That's really fucking creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's Henry Winkler with it.  The thing is, it doesn't have a little fence around it or anything.  It's just standing there.  Rocking out on the street.  Rocking out.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  It looks nothing like him, by the way. 
[02:26:00]  Of course.  His face looks nothing like him.  What the fuck does it look like?  It looks like a villain from a Guy Ritchie film.  It looks like Tay Zandé.  Yeah.  Fonzie, I liked Happy Days.  The first season was done on film.  It wasn't done in front of a studio audience.  They did use canned laughs, but a lot of shows did then.  So it had a film look to it.  They did a lot of outside locations.  It wasn't just the Cunningham House and fucking Arnold's and shit like that. 
[02:26:30]  And Fonzie wore fucking like a windbreaker.  Yeah, he started off in a little white jacket.  And just barely said a few words.  He was the cool guy that just gave these little dumb words of wisdom to the three dopey nerdy guys.  Yeah, yeah.  And then it turned out like everyone liked Fonzie.  So he had to become this superhero where by the end he had like magic powers.  Oh, he was jumping the shark.  That's where it soon comes from.  Yeah, he jumped the shark.  Exactly.  And it just became so dumb.  And just the other day, as a matter of fact, it came on. 
[02:27:00]  And it was one of the last few where no one was left.  It was the neighbor guy from fucking Married with Children.  Oh, Ted McKinley.  Yeah, him.  Something like that, right?  And then like fucking Joni's friend was a lead.  Oh, um, um, uh.  Jenny Piccolo.  Jenny Piccolo was a show of what she looked like.  And she was a lead character.  But they were desperate.  They never showed her when the show was happening.  Everyone was gone.  Laverne and Shirley were more popular.  They used to just be Fonzie's day.  Yeah.  Were the Cunninghams still together? 
[02:27:30]  Yes, it was the big thing.  Like, the big thing was, uh, was Howard Cunningham.  Like, he was the big and, uh, what's his name?  Tom Bosley.  Do you remember like when Fonzie got married?  Like, he met that girl?  Like, he was married.  And then in like, in the really early episodes, like the first four episodes, when there used  to be an older brother in the Cunningham.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they just stopped talking about him.  Chuck just went away.  Yeah, like a war happened or something.  They decided, yeah, maybe he was one of the first advisors that went into the NOM.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  And it never came back.  They realized he didn't test well.  So like, fuck, let's just make believe that never happened.  We should take a break because we're, everyone's backing up.  We got Kurt Metzger outside.  Yeah.  Who's, uh, helping you out at Caroline's, right?  Yeah.  I only got the same very briefly last night.  Ooh, what the fuck, dude?  Give me that.  Wow.  Motherfucker.  Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange Anniversary Edition.  Nice.  40th Anniversary Edition.  Uh, two discs, new special features.  That was illegal in Australia right up until the mid-90s.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:28:30]  Clockwork?  Yeah.  There was something about Mind Control.  Because of the rape scene?  The rape scene and Mind Control or something.  It wasn't allowed to be aired.  I remember my brother had like a bootleg, uh, Betamax version of it that we watched.  And I thought it was going to be the most horrific film ever because it was the only  banned film.  What a great movie, man.  This is so fucking cool.  Yeah, he'll be here on the 26th.  Oh my.  That is the shit, man.  Oh, my uncle, uh, has got a quote on here.  Oh yeah?  Robert Hughes.  He works at Time.  Oh.  Uh, it says, so inventive and powerful that it could be viewed again and again and yield  up fresh illuminations. 
[02:29:00]  Look at that.  Mm-hmm.  That's the same thing that Pete Townsend said about the webpage.  Fucking blue, man.  But my uncle made a fucking, he's made the quote on the, uh, Malcolm McDowell.  Malcolm McDowell is going to be in, uh, our very studio.  That's, that's fucking cool as shit, man.  Yeah, it is.  All right.  So we got Kurt Metzger.  We really got a break.  And we got Ian Halpern and his trollops.  His trollops.  Coming into the studio.  Can't wait to, uh, see Ian.  Always a pleasure to have Ian, uh, in studio.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B.  Anthony.  You're going to learn all this crap when you get a house.  Kurt Metzger in studio is helping out, uh, Jim Jeffries at Caroline's.  Yes.  212-757-4100.  I think, uh, I'm going to have a whole crew come tomorrow night, by the way, Jim.  Excellent, man.  Excellent.  Which means, uh, some of the paying customers are going to have to be booted, so I got to 
[02:30:00]  see.  It really bums out Greg Charles when he has to tell a paying customer they got to stand  up against the back wall.  Not in the bathroom, though.  Hey, did those ladies last night, those Canadian ladies that look like...  Oh, they loved it.  The old birds in the front.  Yeah, they were cool.  And they came to see you, specifically.  Yeah.  They were, they were, a group of six women who would have been in their late 60s, I reckon.  Are fans of...  Are fans of mine, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  And they all came along, yeah.  Would you finger pop them?  I, I don't know what that means, but sure.  Or...  Oh, did I finger them?  No, would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Like, what would you...  Not at their menopausal age.  I don't know.  Just Harry and Lou.  Wait, Jim, you're kind of sick, though.  What would you do with them?  What would they...  With 60-year-olds?  Yeah.  Nothing.  I'm not that sick.  Who's the sick one?  I'd rather...  Oh, it's Joe DeRosa, right?  Oh, yeah, DeRosa.  Oh, yeah, DeRosa likes...  He likes all broads.  I don't like all, but...  I have a theory on that, is that whole thing when they go, men over 80 can't get erections, 
[02:31:00]  and it's like, yeah, they're fucking 80-year-olds.  You know what I mean?  So simple.  It's so simple.  It's like, where's all this old lady porn?  What are these old men watching?  Yeah, yeah.  And why isn't there so much old lady porn?  DeRosa is watching that old lady porn.  Oh, DeRosa wants to watch it.  But I'll watch some MILF porn.  I mean, I really will, but I got a limit.  Yeah, but MILF porn's like a 30-year-old woman.  Yeah, yeah.  It is.  I'll go up to, like, 50, dude, if they look right. 
[02:31:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  You were looking at a 50-year-old the other day, and you said it was all right.  You said it was all right.  That's one in a million.  It's an anomaly.  That's like finding an old fucking peach and going, this one's not too bad.  You're still going to eat the nicer peaches.  You want the nice peach.  I think I could eat around the bruises.  My whole take on it also is, if you live to be old, there's plenty of time to fuck old. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  You know, when you're in your 70s, you're probably not going to be getting any 20-year-old fucking...  I just know, when I was 10, I liked 20-year-old women, and people used to joke about, like,  oh, he's into the older ladies, and I'm 34 now, like 20-year-old women.  20-year-old, stay in there.  It just never fucking changed.  It's like, I always want a Ferrari, but I can't afford a Ferrari.  So when I'm 50, I'll get a Ferrari, and I'll fuck a 20-year-old, and people go, oh, look  at that pathetic man going through a middle-aged crisis.  Yeah.  Achieving goals, my friend.  That's what it is. 
[02:32:30]  Ian Alpern wants him badly, so...  He's brought two birds with him.  I kind of vaguely know.  He's written a book on Michael Jackson that was very well-received.  Is that the one that says he's just a gay guy?  Yeah.  That's his book?  How does he find this information out?  Obviously, he goes undercover as Andrew Dice Clay, and they let him in anywhere.  How do you incorporate that Dice look?  Obviously, just like Corey Feldman's Michael Jackson family would let him in. 
[02:33:00]  Let's bring him in.  That's hilarious, dude.  Yeah, well, let's...  All right, get him in here.  This guy is...  Well, I don't even know how to describe him to anyone who hasn't met him.  Well, he's...  Jewy?  Jewy.  I think he brings a lot of hot girls around because he's very confused about his own sexuality.  His own sexuality?  Well, we don't know.  And he's a girl?  I don't know.  Allegedly.  He's alleged that he has.  He's got goddesses now.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, here he goes.  Ian Halperin.  Ian.  It's been a while. 
[02:33:30]  And the ladies and his ladies.  That's my twin brother.  How you doing, my friend?  What's up?  How you doing there?  Ian Halperin and the two lovely, lovely ladies.  He was here one time you were here.  That's right.  Was that the same Paddy's Day, though?  I question your sexuality.  I was wasted on ecstasy.  I thought you guys met.  I thought so.  And he's just babbling.  No one knows what he's saying.  Oh, he's talking into a mic that ain't on.  He's got girls that are on his arms. 
[02:34:00]  He's literally, it smells like a strip club in here now.  He's trying to make his...  It's like the new level manager of a strip club energy.  He's got a turtleneck and a chain in the whole thing.  Isn't that a fun gag?  Yeah.  The mic comes off.  Ian, what's up?  He's holding...  My dick.  They're all wrapped...  How are you doing?  Jesus.  They're all wrapped in wires from microphones and headphones.  All right, let's get the promo out of the way first.  Uh-huh.  I have another movie airing tonight.  Airing tonight? 
[02:34:30]  Yes.  And where is it airing?  Uh, in the States on the TV Guide channel.  All right.  Why aren't these movies ever in theaters?  Dude, you know what?  Yeah.  If you'd see the paycheck I'm getting, you would like...  This airs in 90 countries.  Yeah, I'll fucking matter.  What is the movie?  Simultaneously.  Take a guess what the movie is.  Um, let's see.  It's what's on Channel 7 between 9 and 11.  Is it House?  No, hold on. 
[02:35:00]  Let me get...  I'm not going to let you trash my employer TV Guide in the States.  I would never...  They have Curb Your Enthusiasm.  I got a question.  They have Spin City.  I've watched it.  Can I...  And they have His Highness.  If you're not going to listen, then we've got to kick you out right away.  If you're on the TV Guide channel...  Opie, I can't see you.  I can't see you.  I have to see you.  I just want to ask this.  Do they give you the common courtesy of giving you the full screen or is your movie being  played with the fucking programming?  The programming guy.  Like a John Henson shirt.  That would really suck. 
[02:35:30]  So they give you the courtesy of giving you the full screen on the TV Guide.  Let me answer my idol.  Opie is one of my idols.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Of course.  No, really.  Yeah.  You know, again, anyone who has lasted in this business 10 years plus,  both you and Anthony, I take my hat off to you.  We laugh at 10 years.  Now, look.  Yes, it's in my contract.  They take off all of that, you know, what's on and this and that.  Right.  When His Highness comes on, it's full screen.  And what is the feature going to be?  It's Charlie Sheen. 
[02:36:00]  Charlie Sheen.  So you did a little Charlie Sheen kind of...  It's not a little one, baby.  It's not a little one.  Okay.  It's a play zone.  It's going to go bigger than my jacks.  What did Charlie Sheen play?  Charlie Sheen.  All right.  Where did you...  I got Emilio Estivizid.  Now, where did you get the info?  Who did you talk to?  All right.  Let me tell you something.  What did you...  What can we watch on this and learn that we have not already learned about this film?  All right.  First off...  Yes.  Everyone connected to CS is in this film.  Mm-hmm.  You have all his goddesses. 
[02:36:30]  Like M.J.  Yeah, Charlie Sheen.  You have all his goddesses.  Uh-huh.  I'll tell you one thing.  Did you talk to Brie Olsen?  Now, you got Brie to open up about...  I love Brie Olsen.  Brie Olsen's like one of my...  I infiltrated Charlie's camp.  No one takes it up the hospital.  She does it with such comfort and ease and then talks like a child.  Like she's got the voice of a four-year-old.  Oh, that's fantastic.  And it's just, yeah, put it up my ass.  I've got nothing to do.  That's hysterical, man. 
[02:37:00]  All right.  So, Trie.  Yeah, we got...  I heard you infiltrate.  You infiltrated?  Yeah, I infiltrate.  I went undercover.  I've been living with some gods.  How do you go undercover?  Well, look at me.  Do I look...  Did you go undercover as a straight man?  I'm really...  When I go undercover, man...  Is there gay Jew nightclubs?  Yeah, there you go.  You know, every time I come on the show with this guy, I like this guy.  I became a fan of his the last time...  Yes, Jim Jefferies.  ...we were on together.  Very funny guy.  A year ago, we were on together.  Every time I do a film, I have to see Jim Jefferies in studio upstage me, but that's  cool. 
[02:37:30]  I'm a big fan, Jim.  Thank you.  Congrats.  I saw your pick up in Times Square.  You're performing somewhere there, right?  Yes.  Caroline.  Caroline.  All weekend long.  That's...  Hey, I'm a big fan, dude.  And what about Chicago?  You're doing Chicago?  Is that what you were saying there?  I'm going to do the Chicago Comedy Festival coming up in June.  Well, I know the CEO of the Chicago Comedy Festival, Just for Laughs, Andy Nolman, a very  dear friend of mine.  A dear friend.  I love that.  A dear friend.  We're good people.  I grew up with Andy, and I'll tell you something.  When you go to Chicago, go visit my peeps. 
[02:38:00]  They own a restaurant called Jedi.  Yeah.  It will be the best grub you've ever had.  Ask for Tom.  Tell him his highness sent you, and the meal's on the house.  I'll be all right.  I'll be all right.  I'll be all right.  Fucking rule.  Hey, Ian, so you...  Yes, Opie.  Yes, Opie.  You were infiltrated.  How did you infiltrate?  Yeah.  Well, I've been living with goddesses.  Did you want your protective vests of blackjacks to get in?  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, I love this guy. 
[02:38:30]  He's peeking out from behind a castle made of...  Dude, look.  You are just living vicariously through his highness.  When was the last time you got laid?  Dude, I was...  No, he just showed me a picture.  I don't even want to bring it up.  We fucked in the dressing room last night.  I know.  You guys looked like it.  Oh, shit.  I see the stains.  As I said that me and Kurt fucked in the dressing room, he started wanking.  Infiltrate.  Let's go.  Yeah.  How did you infiltrate?  In this movie, first off, you will see Charlie's personal drug dealer on camera. 
[02:39:00]  How's that?  And I give him a polygraph.  And he fesses up to it.  I gave Charlie's...  I give him a polygraph exam, and you're going to see the results of the exam.  His personal madame, she's in the movie, too.  Everyone in his camp...  Again, I'm the leading guy in the world in undercover.  Everyone knows that.  I've written many books, many films.  And, you know, as you see, I'm not undercover today, though.  These are my beautiful goddesses.  I'd like to introduce them to you, Anthony. 
[02:39:30]  I see that short.  We're literally under the cover of these girls.  You are buried under a pile of these girls.  Yes.  How much did you pay them to come with you today?  Oh, damn.  What are you implying?  Opie, seriously, your lines are getting old.  You got his highness here.  How much?  Show some respect.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm not saying they're hookers.  Jim, let me see Opie.  He's got a nice poem.  I can't see him.  He's a good-looking guy, Opie.  There he is.  Hey, girls.  I want to ask you, women.  I reckon you paid him in shiny objects. 
[02:40:00]  Who's better looking?  Who's better looking, Opie or Anthony?  Oh, please.  Of course.  It's a Hall and Oates thing.  You're better looking at Hanks.  That's just a lie.  The one on the left, you're wearing some pink Betty Boo underwear.  How can you see it?  Because I have supervision.  Oh, shit.  She's got pink underwear on?  Yeah, I was looking at that.  Betty Boo underwear.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was looking at that.  You were looking at that?  The black skin.  Yeah, the way she was set.  It really popped.  It really popped.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You never would have seen that.  No.  You didn't introduce us to your goddesses. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, let me introduce you to the goddesses.  And who are they and what are they all about?  All right, this is goddess number one.  I'm Giselle.  And what do you do, Giselle?  We're lovers, basically.  That's all you do.  Do you make a living out of that?  It's enough for me to know if you guys find out.  We're trying to find out.  Now we're asking a question.  Does his highness treat you well?  He treats us very well.  And, you know, listen, it's like early in the morning.  It's early in the morning.  We were partying all night.  You know what I mean?  We're just like chilling.  Coke?  Were you taking Coke last night? 
[02:41:00]  Were you on drugs?  No, no, no.  Then why are you so awake?  What happened?  Why wouldn't you do that?  No, no.  We were partying.  You know, we're just chilling right now.  What kind of partying though?  We were karaokeing and we frolicked in the sheets.  Karaoke.  Karaoke and frolicking.  And frolicking.  Yes.  That sounds fun.  I like a little karaoke and some frolicking.  And let me introduce you to the goddesses.  Fro-ry-oke.  Yeah.  Olivia.  Olivia.  Olivia.  Olivia.  Olivia.  What do you do with Ian?  And be more specific than your friend.  I just be hot.  She's a Latoya Jackson look-alike. 
[02:41:30]  Really?  You think so?  No, come on.  There's no comparison here.  Look how natural she's.  Take off the shade.  Show them your beautiful...  Yeah, she's hot.  I mean, come on.  No, no.  Latoya Jackson, man.  These girls are not hot.  I'm only joking.  I'm only joking.  Fred Flintstone wouldn't even fuck Latoya Jackson at this point.  So, you know, really.  Oh, that's amazing.  Would you fuck Latoya?  And I love Latoya.  She's one of the nicest person I've ever fucked.  I would.  Just to taste what Joe Jackson tastes like. 
[02:42:00]  I would like to lick up that power.  Anyone that can control that many kids, I would gargle Joe Jackson's cum.  She needs to be able to manage five black children properly.  By the way, we got on our screen here Ian in bed with our own Troy Kwan.  Oh, right.  At his bed-in for his...  That was the bed-in.  For his governator book.  By the way, in your governator...  Oh, they're making out. 
[02:42:30]  How nice.  Ian, in your governator book, did you talk about how this marriage was a shame?  I predicted it, dude.  What did you say?  I said within one year they'd split.  There's a big story coming out tomorrow.  I've had over 200 interview requests.  I've only given one.  It's coming out in the Daily Mail in the UK tomorrow.  But I'll say this.  I predicted it.  They're calling me Hollywood's Nostradamus, whatever.  I said they'd split within one year.  Who's they?  Who is called...  And who pronounces it Nostradamus?  Who's they the media?  Nostradamus.  It's the chick on his left side of the line. 
[02:43:00]  You guys, you know...  I think you might have predicted that one.  You guys all are living vicariously this morning for his highness.  We're a little jealous.  And I was going to give Anthony a piece of the action after the show.  Oh, again?  The wrong color for Anthony.  If he keeps insulting me, the best he's going to get is Sam Roberts, right up the ass.  Yeah, yeah.  But the girls might not be Anthony's taste, is all I'm saying.  Well, I stick pretty much to white chicks, but the one on the right's pretty light. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, she's light.  You wouldn't take either of those?  Well, either of those girls are pretty hot.  You wouldn't take either of us because he's gay.  I don't know if we would take him.  That's the opposite.  Yeah, yeah.  That's okay.  You wouldn't want one of them to take you?  Just a big, meaty clitoris fucking you in the ass, Anthony.  A meaty clitoris fucking me in the ass?  No. 
[02:44:00]  Wow.  I don't think so.  That's got to be the name of my next band, Big Meaty Clitoris.  I'm a fucking...  Olive wants to say something.  Go ahead, Olive.  Severe racist.  Go ahead, Olive.  Olive?  Olive?  She does have an olive complication.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, I have no doubt if you guys are boring me.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How come we bore you, but you hang out with Ian all day?  I didn't have to pay for it.  Yeah, see?  At all.  Yeah, see, that's fucking the shit right there. 
[02:44:30]  Living vicariously.  Ian.  Vicariously, this son of a bitch.  So, Ian, where'd you get these girls, though?  Where would one get these girls?  We are living together.  We've lived together for about...  How long have we lived together now?  Like eight months.  So?  Oh, three of you live together.  We've known each other for a while, but...  Then who were the other girls that were on the phone with you last time?  I have backup goddesses.  Do you sleep in the same bed, or...?  Of course we sleep in the same bed.  Do all the other men coming over to visit him, does that bother you? 
[02:45:00]  Amazing, amazing.  Like, is there someone that's cum shooting across that bed while you're sleeping?  It looks like the Matrix.  The only cum shooting is...  No wonder this guy's just playing Carolines.  Oh!  No, really.  Wow.  The jokes are getting old, but I'm a big fan of gyms.  Oh, boy, this ain't good.  I want to cast Jim in my next film.  The jokes are getting old.  These are all off the cuff.  That's all right.  But Jim, it's early in the morning, because I know when you're at Carolines, you slam it.  I do, yes.  You're world class.  He's not slamming it today, though, huh?  No, he's a bit off. 
[02:45:30]  It's just going to make him work hard.  The jokes are a bit stale.  Listen, we talked to Charlie Sheen's drug dealer in this movie, of course.  Yeah, on the record.  On the record.  That's good.  Did you meet him at the same projects you pick your women up at?  No!  Exactly.  Oh!  I think you're facing a project.  No, you didn't.  Oh, at least it's white.  Oh, boy.  Anthony, come here.  Come here a second, Anthony.  No, no, I'm sorry.  I'll stay here.  I need you here.  I need you here.  Don't get too close, Anthony.  You'll catch something.  I got to stay here. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, he's got to...  I don't want to catch poverty.  We can't leave his post.  You know, you're going home today with your left hand.  Yep, I am.  I'm going home.  How's I pay for it?  On your four-inch ruler.  Yeah.  And you're going to...  All that you're going to be thinking of is his highness fucking...  His highness what?  End of the month coming around, waiting for those checks to come in so you can pay the rent?  You and your two roommates?  What's the matter?  Can't have a...  The fucking TV Guide Channel not paying the rent, is it?  You got to pick up two roommates?  Anthony...  Is that what the fucking deal is? 
[02:46:30]  Anthony...  Ian and Alperin?  You're so funny, Anthony.  Let me tell you something.  Of course I am.  I'm a fucking hoot.  This is great.  I'm really ugly.  Oh, my God.  Hey, hey, hey.  Those jokes are getting a bit stale.  Yeah.  I love Frustration.  I love Anthony.  I wish him all the best.  He's one of my idols, too.  I got to ask you.  First of all, these are different girls from the last batch you had.  And is it true...  Hold on.  Is it true one of them asked you what your favorite food was outside the studio? 
[02:47:00]  Why would they ask that if you guys are all living together?  No, because we're going to another restaurant.  Because he's always eating my pussy, so I wouldn't know.  Oh.  Pretty much.  Looks like a wallet.  Give me a kiss.  Give me a kiss.  So his favorite food's leather.  I used to imagine how costly I have to push his face.  I'm not going to let you guys insult these beautiful women here and myself.  I'm not insulting them.  You know, they're highly educated.  Hold on.  They have masters.  Degrees.  Oh, mass.  Massa.  They're on a different platform.  Massa degrees.  Massa degrees.  Although, I do like the Tutsi better than the Hutu. 
[02:47:30]  I'm just saying.  I was offended by that.  I'm Australian.  Well, one looks a little more Tutsi and one looks Hutu.  You know, Anthony?  I don't even know what that means.  Are you speaking English?  No, no, no.  Are you speaking English?  You're African cultures.  I know you're African cultures.  African cultures.  I know it.  Fucking the peanut guy.  I know it all.  Fucking George Washington Carver.  The peanut guy that ripped off our president's name. 
[02:48:00]  I know all that shit.  You're just jealous because you can't handle it.  Is that the first white president?  I don't think you can handle caramel.  I think that's the problem.  What?  Caramel.  Believe me.  You can't handle caramel.  I can handle it.  Anthony, you couldn't even handle Jill Nicolini, His Highness' leftovers.  I handled Jill Nicolini.  You got into His Highness' leftovers.  Tell me you didn't.  I handled Jill Nicolini for an entire summer, my friend.  Yeah, but she had miles of His Highness cocking her when you got there. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, really?  Miles and miles of His Highness in there.  Oh, boy.  Miles.  Every time you kissed her, you were kissing His Highness' cum.  Yeah, well, you were kissing about 18 Islanders, so.  I think we both, you know.  And Charles Wang, the owner of the Islanders, that's a good point.  I think we all shot and scored.  Who got to Jill Firth, Garth Snow or His Highness?  I have no idea.  His Highness.  I don't know.  We don't care.  I don't really look into the sexual history. 
[02:49:00]  Garth Snow and the legendary radio host Anthony were doing His Highness' sloppy leftovers.  I'm sure after she had you, she washed herself with a toilet pad.  Yeah, I'm sure something happened.  By the steel wool, just trying to get the shame out of her.  Did she ever tell you about this dude?  Huh?  Anthony, did she ever?  Did she ever tell you about you?  No, no, no.  I never heard about it.  It was, well, no, I didn't know him until after we were broken up anyway.  That's right. 
[02:49:30]  So he came to me and said, oh, you went out with Jill.  So I wasn't able to ask her about him because we had already, I'd already cheated horribly  on her.  There's no way in the world she was just going to bring him up.  No, no.  Well, let me tell you about this wonderful man I was with, Ian Swapra.  Listen, I know a bunch of dudes, I know a bunch of versions of Ian.  Like, I met a bunch of, like, Jewish hustler dudes that are, like, insecure and, like,  you know, not, like, bad, like, you know, I don't hate him, but, like, you know, he's  trying, right?  Right.  And there's always, like, I'm always curious of these girls that, like, fuck with him. 
[02:50:00]  Like, I just want to ask him about.  It's almost like the girls are sweet, almost.  Like, they're going to get sick of this.  Oh, yeah.  This ain't going to last long.  It don't matter what the hell.  Listening to his horse shit.  For a guy with a small dick and a small bank account, you sure have a fucking big money.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Now, let me tell you something, dude.  Let's compare bank accounts.  Let's compare who got laid the most in the last month, and then let's talk.  But until then, have you ever written number one? 
[02:50:30]  New York Times bestsellers produced movies all over the world?  How do we do that?  I'm a teenage.  Ian, when I was 16.  Yes, baby.  You lost his virginity?  I tried to suck my own dick, and I got past the helmet, dude.  Oh, damn.  That's a true story.  I believe you.  Congratulations on that.  I believe you.  I'm looking at your shoes, and your dick is sticking out.  Like, what are we trying to prove?  Why would they be sticking out of his shoes?  Well, something's hanging right in his pants, though.  That means he's got a really long dick.  Yeah, but they should be sticking out of his pants.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:51:00]  Sticking out the bottom of his pants.  Sticking out of his shoes.  It means he's like a protest deformity.  Who has a hard-on in here?  Opie, are you hard yet?  No, I'm not.  Danny's got a hard-on.  Danny's got a hard-on.  Because Danny likes the ghetto booty.  Opie's a married man with a kid.  He's a great father.  Doting dad.  But I'm not dead!  Danny, you like the booty?  The ghetto booty?  Usually, but I haven't seen theirs, though.  Can we see your booties?  First of all, we're not ghetto.  Or do we have to pay like Ian's?  First of all, we're not ghetto.  So let's get that straight.  We're not ghetto. 
[02:51:30]  What makes you not ghetto?  Can I see your booties?  What makes you not ghetto?  You guys are like bar mitzvah boys at a strip club for the first time.  You can hear the way we speak.  Do you sound ghetto?  Do you sound ghetto?  What do you have a master's degree?  I'm from another country.  That's kind of ghetto.  To tolerate a dude like this?  He's not ghetto.  Because he has a movie on the TV guy channel?  That's very ghetto.  TV guy channel.  One of the girls has feathers out of their head like Mr. T.  That's fairly ghetto.  That's a little ghetto.  Yeah, you're all wearing the long feather earrings.  They're making a comeback, though.  But not your look.  You look great.  But I'm just saying, just to be on this guy's lap is ghetto. 
[02:52:00]  Like, I've got to survive, so I'll have to deal with this for a little while.  Who said we need to survive?  There's no reason you would put up with this for free.  Right, right, right.  There's got to be something.  There's nothing better for five seconds.  Yeah, we know that much.  It's got to be something.  I don't even dislike them.  You just do so much little class.  What have you produced, dude?  I've never even heard of you, Schlemiel, before.  You know, seriously.  Now he's throwing fucking Yiddish out there.  The black chicks love the Yiddish.  What the fuck is this guy?  This guy's got balls. 
[02:52:30]  You know, I'm about to clock him.  I'm a martial arts expert.  And if he opens his mouth, he's going to go.  Come here, sister.  Let me blow a little schmutz in your face.  You are not going to insult my beautiful goddesses.  Enjoy that schmutz.  You've done nothing with your life.  You've got a bank account the size of Opie's penis.  First of all, we're...  Oh, damn, the double insult.  What do you mean?  I got a small penis, but don't make me fall out.  Opie's the only one being nice to you.  Why are you?  Damn, what the fuck?  I'm the only friend you've got in this room right now.  I'm a fan of Opie.  And besides...  Opie's a mentor to me. 
[02:53:00]  I've always said that on my Twitter.  My penis is not looking good.  He's one of the most solid guys in radio.  You've never fucking tweeted about me.  My penis isn't looking good right now because I'm on a lot of allergy medicine.  I know.  So it makes it a little soft and not sad looking.  But in general, it's a nice piece I got.  That's why we've got to get you some multivitamin, the wellness formula.  Listen, Ian.  Infiltrated.  Yes.  So how do you infiltrate the fucking camp of Charlie Sheen?  Look, when you walk into Kentucky Fried Chicken, you don't ask the colonel for the recipe.  Well, you pick up girls there.  If I would tell you how, all you've got to do is watch the movie tonight. 
[02:53:30]  Obviously.  Stop it.  Stop it.  You're being roasted.  Wait for your fucking question.  What the fuck?  I've never seen someone sing so and so bad.  You're still giving your answer.  Right.  See, what he's suggesting is these girls came from Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Just in case you missed it.  You've got to watch the film and then it's going to be the best film you've ever seen.  See, he's not going to give details.  Better than The Wizard of Oz. 
[02:54:00]  Better than The Cogfather.  Ian Alvarez never gives details on these movies.  He's constantly making us wait.  Have you seen his movies?  I saw one.  I'm not going to tell you how I do it.  Which documentary was the one that came out before this one?  Which one did you do?  The Michael Jackson film.  Yeah, I saw Michael Jackson.  Played in a hundred countries.  Yeah, it was decent.  I mean, it was good.  I'll watch it.  I've got to give it to him.  You know, that one was decent.  He had great subject matter.  This one's better.  Anthony, this one's better.  Is it better?  Yes.  Really?  Yeah, this is the best one.  Do you get to talk to Charlie?  You'll see tonight. 
[02:54:30]  Can you imagine the two of them talking at each other?  No.  I'll say this about Charlie.  Charlie's the smartest guy in Hollywood I've ever met.  Really?  He's the most clever.  Leaving a great, highest-paying job with Opie in here, too.  Highest-paying job in Hollywood, and he leaves, and he's the smartest guy ever.  And he's doing a live show that allegedly sucks balls.  You only wish you'd be with Live Nation with thousands of people screaming, come on, Charlie  Sheen's number one.  They're screaming for their money back because they were robbed. 
[02:55:00]  They're worse.  They ripped off Michael Jackson, AEG.  They listen to his stupid poems like he was fucking Colonel Kurt.  Yeah.  His dad has to hack him up now.  Oh, you guys all wish you'd have the...  See, you guys all wish you'd have the pussy, the bank account, and the charisma of Charlie  Sheen.  Why do you think I don't have achievements?  I can't keep talking to four guys who aren't...  There's so much distress in this room over there, that's why I'm sitting here.  Yeah, right?  What do you think?  So, I have no achievements.  We're on the same fucking shell.  How do you think that happens?  Yeah, but... 
[02:55:30]  With your amazing achievements and my no achievements.  But you haven't got ghetto whores on your left, Kurt.  Ian just leans over and starts making out.  First we're ghetto, but now we're whores now, right?  Oh, shit, I didn't even notice he said that.  I was like, oh, yeah.  You're not invited.  Well, I'm looking at one right now, so I guess there's my room.  You are not invited to the wedding gym.  I think they're very hot.  I'm not invited to the wedding.  That's a shame.  I'm having a fried chicken for a while. 
[02:56:00]  We're having a traditional Jewish wedding, and no one's invited here except Sam Roberts.  You better not be a buff, I assume.  What are your mom going to eat at all?  Opie's going to give me a wedding.  If you're having a traditional Jewish wedding, your mother would kill herself.  Oh, right?  Stop it.  Ian, what's your Twitter?  What, are you going to get yarmulkes with weaves in them?  Twitter.com forward slash Ian Undercover.  Motherfucker.  Ian Undercover is going to hang whitefish in the windows.  I'm not saying they're not beautiful, Ian. 
[02:56:30]  Listen, I don't think they're beautiful girls.  I'm tweeting a picture of Ian and the bitches right now.  Ian and his other bitches.  Ian Undercover is a compliment.  Look, I said what I'm going to say, you come in, you sit on a guy's lap in a thing.  What am I, I'm just, you know.  You're just, you're just, you're just, you're just, you're just, you're having fun.  You're calling it as you say it.  We're having fun.  You don't know about fun.  I'm having fun.  Oh, shit.  Why are you so stiff?  What are you so stiff?  Oh, man.  It's not, listen, it's not stiffness.  What I'm saying is, you can't say he doesn't. 
[02:57:00]  That dude gets on your nerves.  There's no way he doesn't.  Oh, dude.  Be more like Ian.  Don't be stiff.  No way.  Here's the deal.  I've heard enough of this, dude.  I believe his bank account is much.  I believe it's very bad.  I believe you 100%, dude.  Until you write a number one New York Times bestseller, I can't talk to this guy again.  Until you produce a hit movie, until you do a killing stand-up routine, we have to do  We have our fucking skill sets, fuckface.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:57:30]  You know what I mean?  Like, you can't do stand-up comedy, you fucking prick.  Let's settle this in the ring.  Until you do a best-selling thing, your life's a fucking shame.  You're nothing.  You're a homosexual covering the...  You're so funny, your jokes are so old.  You know what?  Your jokes are so stale, Jim.  How are they stale?  You've been doing the same jokes for 20 years, man.  What?  You're not doing any original material.  I've been in the comics for 10 years. 
[02:58:00]  And you just said how funny it was.  And you're so fucking frustrated.  You have your hand on your cock right now.  I tweeted a picture, so if you want to see what these bras look like.  The girls are trying to break out the karate, Ian.  As opposed to Ian, whose books are like fucking Mad Libs.  All you do is put another celebrity's name in, the drug dealer, the fucking thing.  It's the same fucking book.  You must just punch up book one on fucking Word and just punch in the various celebrity names.  You got it.  Is that pretty much your formula?  You realize the secret of his harness.  Here I am.  I'm deep undercover in Charlie Sheen's compound. 
[02:58:30]  What?  Are you?  Really?  Yeah.  So how did you get in?  I'm not going to reveal the tricks of the trade.  The tricks of the trade?  I got in and literally...  Reveal the tricks on your lap.  Literally got in.  Who's turning tricks for trade?  What do they have masters in?  I want to know.  Yeah, what are your masters in, girls?  Yeah, what do you get to go to school and what are your masters in?  They're not going to tell you where they went to school, but tell me.  No, we're not going to. 
[02:59:00]  What?  What's so secret about that?  We're smart.  Just know that.  We're smart.  I'm not denying it.  Listen, we're smart.  I just want to know what you're a master in.  When you want to know about the movie, you'll see it.  If you want to know about the movie, you'll see it.  If you want to know about the movie, you'll see it.  You would always bring it up.  No one would keep that a secret.  Right, right.  Why would you keep that a secret?  Why would that be a secret?  Because we're chilling, man.  Because you don't have one.  Honestly, no black female that had a master's degree would not immediately snap into telling  you the degree where she got it from.  It's like you said that ghetto thing.  She'll just for information.  I got a degree in something, something. 
[02:59:30]  That shows you that I don't have to prove anything.  Hold on.  That's racist.  Dude, that's bigotry.  Seriously.  Let me tell you something.  Seriously, dude.  Those three minds are a terrible thing to waste.  No, no.  I'm going to have to call Al Sharpton.  Al Sharpton, who I love.  I'm going to the race ride police Al Sharpton to boycott this douche.  Because that's racist.  Oh, damn.  Why is that racist?  Stop.  Maybe I'm just playing a race card.  I love Al.  I might just know a lot of people.  No, dude, dude.  You can't insult people like that. 
[03:00:00]  I'm not insulting them.  That's racist.  That's racist.  That's racist, dude.  Dude, racism's like cancer.  You don't know when you have it.  Holy shit.  I wish I had cancer now.  I wish to God that I had cancer.  I wish you had cancer, too.  Wait a second.  If there's one person who is not worthy of breathing on this planet this morning, I'm looking  right at him right now.  I don't want to breathe.  And I don't wish bad for anyone.  Can't help with us.  But seriously, I wish you had testicular cancer this morning.  Wow.  I got with a bad case of the cancer just the other day. 
[03:00:30]  I knew I had it right away.  I was saying the N-word left right in the back.  We want to do a meditation here for a second.  What?  Because this is getting a bit crazy.  Oh, radio meditation.  That's great.  Hey, that's crazy.  I wouldn't.  That's racist.  Oh, like they're kissing.  Look at this.  They're calling your goddesses the grossesses.  No, we get home.  The grossesses.  They only wish.  Everyone's sitting at home right now.  We're in their cars.  Looking out the window.  One hand on the wheel.  One hand on their cock.  Thinking of the goddesses. 
[03:01:00]  And that's for Tom.  Do all three of you fuck at once?  Oh, yeah.  Good question.  What other way would there be?  I just told you.  So, can you two girls stop making out for us in front of the Jew?  We don't get out like that.  You know why?  No, we're not going to do that.  I actually thought...  Do you know why?  Because that's what you want.  I knew you were going to say that.  I actually thought he would fuck her while you made the pancakes.  Holy shit.  While I made the pancakes?  Yeah.  Anthony L. Shark.  It's an entermonial joke.  I don't give a shit.  That's racist, dude. 
[03:01:30]  I don't want to have to...  It is racist.  Yes, you're right.  It's racist.  I can't believe you got to explain that to me.  Anthony brought some racism perspective.  That's the problem with this show.  It's terribly racist.  When you go to the courthouse looking for justice in Anthony's eyes, you see just us.  No, I think justice is another one of these chicks.  Come on.  Every time he opens his mouth, there it's fun.  We're up later in Harlem.  Justice and hope are coming.  You only wish you lived half the way these women lived.  I don't mind.  What type of tenement do you douche his liver? 
[03:02:00]  Tenement?  The girls won't kiss each other because they hardly know each other because the three don't live together.  A slumlord like you.  Or known by a guy that sounds very much like you and has a very similar name.  I am going to take it to the streets with these two.  I'll take them on together, these two.  Take it to the streets.  What were you?  We're going to do it old style, schoolyard style.  Let's settle it all outside.  Holy shit.  Where did you girls go to school?  That's all I want to know. 
[03:02:30]  Hunter College.  All right, Hunter.  Okay, where'd you go?  I'm not going to say.  You're not going to say?  You have not got a degree.  I don't have to prove it.  See, the thing about it is you don't need proof of everything.  Let me tell you something.  I don't have to prove anything.  I'm a hot chick.  I got the kindness.  That attitude is destroying America.  No, listen, listen, listen.  I don't have to prove anything.  I'm a hot chick.  I'm a hot chick.  What do I have to prove?  It's not a thing of proof.  It's just conversation.  You bought me an anniversary.  It's conversation.  I don't even have to prove that you're a hot chick. 
[03:03:00]  Can I tell you what you're here to prove?  You're here to prove that he's not gay, basically.  That's literally what you have to prove.  You're not hookers.  Why?  Because you want my cock in your mouth?  It ain't going to happen.  No one can do that job.  It ain't going to happen.  If we were hookers, you wouldn't be able to afford us.  Oh, shit.  Let me tell you about garbage folks.  First of all, she's absolutely right, number one.  Number two.  Not for that much.  I would never pay that much.  I could have fooled the problem.  I just couldn't have fooled the medical pills afterwards.  You know, in comedy, you get all that stuff for free? 
[03:03:30]  Puts!  I don't have to pay for something.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want to pay homage to my idol, Greg Opie, Anthony Hughes.  I want to pay homage to my idol.  You can't afford medication for something you've already got, man.  I just want to say, Opie, Opie, I've got to say one thing.  You're in a different class than everyone else here.  Yeah, of course I am, man.  I respect you.  I love you.  I think you're a world-class man.  No, that divine talk is not going to work, sir.  Anthony, no, no.  I'm not trying to kiss your butt.  Ian Halpern.  And I still love you, too, Anthony.  Thank you.  Love you.  Thank you.  You don't like these two guys?  Thank you, Your Highness.  Not me.  You don't like these two guys? 
[03:04:00]  You know what?  I'm a big fan of Jim.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I recommend anyone to see his show.  The other guy I've never even heard of, he's going to get to know me very well when  I step outside.  Oh, shit.  I'm a martial arts expert.  And then, who said, I want Sam Lina to put it on YouTube.  Because nobody comes in and be racist to my women.  I'm racist.  And also Jim, Jim's a world-class entertainer.  I was the one that said they aren't ghetto.  I meant they're off.  Did you make racist comments?  You're going to have six brothers outside shoving their cock up your ass and Shaq style. 
[03:04:30]  Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, don't fuck with the brothers, man.  And it's how I miss probably.  Yes, dude.  Jesus.  Hold on.  I got a question.  Hold the phone.  Could you show us one karate move?  Because none of us believe you've got karate shit.  Oh, you don't believe that?  Let's step outside.  I don't want to go on you, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Why do you want to step outside, Kirk?  Am I going to have to punch through his vest of half-refaction?  No.  Did you have one girl draped?  It's really a martial art black belt,ux. 
[03:05:00]  I like how the thing was, it was not these guys are going to beat you up.  In his brain, it went to straight to, and they're going to be cumming on you.  And they're all going to be around you.  And they're going to have muscles rippling.  And they're going to hold you down.  You won't know what's going on.  What's going to happen outside?  First of all, why is the hostility of me?  I was the least...  You made racist comments.  I was the least...  Racist comments, dude.  Attacking these girls.  Come on, Kurt.  Kurt, I'm going to draw the line.  I did attack him.  You were pretty racist, Kurt.  Kurt, you were taking a little too far.  I was doing it with humor, Kurt. 
[03:05:30]  All right, let's...  I was doing it with humor, Kurt.  Let's get some makeup.  You're a good guy.  I will put my headphones on.  We will.  Yeah, give me five.  Give me five.  We're friends now.  We're all hooked up.  Listen, I've never had anything against you.  That's not the reason he's holding each fist at me.  Kurt, I've got to protect my goddesses.  I'm a big proponent of African-American culture.  Are you?  And anyone...  Are they African-American or African-Canadian?  Oh, that's a good question.  Dude, I have British goddesses.  I have U.S. goddesses. 
[03:06:00]  And I also have Chinese goddesses.  What's the name of your British goddesses?  This is my American version.  What are all these girls the goddesses of, by the way?  What is that?  I didn't know if you are from that.  It's a viable question because he's a Canadian.  What's the name of your British goddesses?  I'm not a Canadian.  I'm a New Yorker.  Okay.  New Yorker.  I'm a New Yorker.  I'm from Georgia.  I gave you something.  From Georgia.  Georgia!  So what's the name of your British goddesses?  Lana.  Your mom.  And Christina.  And they were on the show last time.  Your mom.  Your mom.  I'm from Australia. 
[03:06:30]  Well done with that degree, sweetheart.  Only the longest two points.  You want me to play some?  Fuck.  That is funny.  That's a good one, Jim.  Now you're getting it, baby.  Oh my God, Jim.  Now he's not so stale anymore.  See, as time goes on, he gets hotter.  People are begging for a karate move.  You got to show one.  Just none of us are believing it.  I'm non-violent until it gets violent.  Oh, shit.  You were just threatening me.  You don't start it, but you finish it.  No, that's outside, bro.  You were just threatening.  He was threatening. 
[03:07:00]  That's outside.  Outside.  We're taking it to street level.  What does that entail?  Do you square off?  Do you square off downstairs on the sidewalk and just start duking it out?  What do you do?  What's your fucking move to get into a fight?  I'm a pacifist, but I have three black belts.  Because when you do what I do, you've got to know how to handle yourself.  Two of them are sitting next to you right now.  I think I'm going to like Kurt better now.  He's more of a man. 
[03:07:30]  Are you circumcised, Kurt?  Yeah.  All right, then I'll get you some Jewish goddesses.  You want to see Troy naked again, Ian?  Listen, I was not trying to destroy you.  Troy's one of the best DJs in New York.  But do you want to see him naked again?  Troy is good people.  He's a straight arrow, just like Opie.  Would Troy like to get naked for Ian again?  I don't know.  I don't know what Troy is.  I want to tell everyone, all kidding aside, I want to thank Opie and Anthony for having  me here today.  Oh, thank you, Ian.  The movie's on TV Guide channel tonight. 
[03:08:00]  Tonight, what time?  10 o'clock and 9 p.m. Central Time.  Yeah.  And I ain't going to disappoint tonight, bro.  This is a Major League movie.  Major League.  Charlie.  You know, Charlie took batting practice the other day at Dodger Stadium, and he hit one  out.  Really?  He's a great ball player.  There you go.  He could be hitting better than Passat is hitting right now in the Yankees.  But he was a pitcher in my career.  You know what's with Passat?  I think we've got to get rid of him.  The guy is just...  He's clutch.  Come on.  Yeah?  You still want him on the team?  Yeah.  The current catcher...  Check this out, Anthony. 
[03:08:30]  The current catcher, I'm good friends with his father, Russell Martin Sr.  He used to be...  He's a world-class sax player.  He used to be...  He played in the metros in Montreal.  That's how he supported Russell Martin to become a ball player.  Oh, you're a Canadian, dude?  Yes, I am.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I saw I even had tagged you.  You know how sad it is.  That's okay.  You're never playing the Just for Life Festival again.  It's a nickname for black people.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, dude.  Oh, now it all makes sense, right?  Oh, man.  It's all coming together now. 
[03:09:00]  He's living the Canadian dream right now of coming to America and doing this.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Especially the Canadian Jewish dream, dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, have you ever fucked a French-Canadian checker?  I have, yes.  No.  I know Jim has.  Oh, actually, you know what?  I was in Ottawa.  We got French-Canadian whores from, like, next door.  My French-Canadian girl is one of the loves of my life.  And she married a daughter.  That's better than mine.  I was doing coke.  I was at this comedy club.  Oh, no.  I only met her once. 
[03:09:30]  I was doing coke as well.  You ever try to get blown in Canada and, like, Ottawa or something?  Fantastic.  The coke in Canada, fantastic.  Well, these people got it for me, but none of them did coke.  I just assumed they were going to hang out with me, the people who worked at the club.  They go, oh, we don't do that.  They just were nice and got me blown.  Wow.  So I'm just by myself.  Yeah.  Very nice.  And some weirdo guy that played, like, Canadian football in Toronto is like, I'll do coke with you, eh?  Oh, yeah.  So we're just hanging out alone in this, like, really shitty penthouse, like a Canadian idea of a penthouse. 
[03:10:00]  Just a moose head.  Yeah, it's just like.  And an easy boy chair.  Dude, I'm on the fold-out bed.  The other comic's in the bedroom.  I'm with this weirdo.  And he goes, let's get some whores, eh?  I'm like, all right.  And I'm all coke out.  Jesus.  So whores show up.  Trusting lad.  There's two of them, right?  One of them, like, both, like, half again, like, pretty hot, right?  One of them is really hot.  And he jumps on that one immediately.  The other one is a little bit heavier, okay?  But not bad.  She was fat.  She was fat.  Looks a lot like my sister.  Let's put it this.  Oh, no.  The heaviness on issue. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, I like your sister.  Look her up on Facebook.  She's lovely.  Oh, that looks like your sister.  Do you look like a guy who fucks your sister?  Well, I couldn't.  Honestly, I don't think I could.  Well, I'm all coke out.  I think you have.  Let me finish the story.  No, just tell me.  Have you ever fucked your sister?  Holy shit.  Let her finish the story, ADD.  You know, honestly, God, this story is not even, like, to glorify me.  And a dude's trying to down me in the middle of a story of how I'm a piece of shit.  We're trying to down you.  I'm in the middle of a story of how I'm not above anyone.  Of how you're a piece of shit.  And he's got to, like, you don't have to knock me down a peg, dude. 
[03:11:00]  It's, like, literally not necessary.  You fucked your sister.  Oh, my God.  All right, long story short, I fucked my sister.  Just admit, you fucked your sister, and then I'll move on.  You fucked your sister.  I don't even know I'm dragging this out.  I fucked my sister.  So coke is a terrible joke.  Holy shit.  I called her a goddess several times afterwards.  Ah, there you go.  As long as you did that.  Why is it everybody just pays a whore and calls her a goddess now?  Like, that's what you gotta do.  You're a god.  Like, is that how you fool girls into... 
[03:11:30]  You know, like, when you see people that love pimps.  Like, that's everything's pimps.  They're fucking slave owners.  Right.  Is that all they had to do in the South was dress up in a fucking Polak outfit and have  a giant cup?  You look like a guy who dreams every night.  And make the fucking slaves call him daddy and that'd be cool.  Is that it?  And then Don...  Holy shit.  That piece of shit Don Juan.  That guy's a slave owner.  That's right on the money.  And this guy's an aspiring slave owner from fucking Canada.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You really are.  You know what, dude?  I love you.  Are we gonna fight again?  But I think it's time Shaq gives it out to you from behind. 
[03:12:00]  That's what you need.  And why do you want to...  I tell you what, his fantasies are all these man-fucking-you.  Shaq's a good friend.  I live in the same building as Shaq's X.  Shawnee, she's nice.  They hate him, right.  They hate him.  Oh, the fans hate him.  You remember Troy, Ian?  Troy's a man.  I want everyone to check out Troy.  Tuesday nights in Manhattan.  He's a world-class DJ and a world-class person.  Wow.  He's an artist.  Troy, Troy.  Do we jive, man?  Yeah, Ian's a man. 
[03:12:30]  You guys make Ian's a man?  Have you guys made out shit?  Troy, Troy, come here a second.  He's a man.  I got a compliment, Troy.  What an endorsement, Troy.  What do you think of my goddesses, Troy?  They're gorgeous.  Listen, I've known Troy for five seconds and he already sucks balls.  No, Troy.  I didn't know he was Canadian, number one, so it takes a lot of the edge off because that's 
[03:13:00]  really, you don't realize how Canadians are.  They're very sensitive and shit.  And this is like, I wouldn't even attack his fucking ego, dude.  I tell that to Jim Carrey, Martin Sheen, John Candy, Wayne Gretzky.  And they all do the speech, dude.  The speech of the famous Canadians.  The famous Canadians.  I love it when you go, what have you contributed to society and they just bang on about maple syrup?  Have you ever put Canadian maple syrup on your girlfriend's little pussy? 
[03:13:30]  No.  Because it's the way to go.  I know, Anthony, you've ever done that?  I wouldn't want to get some type of sugar.  I'm going to send you pure maple syrup.  You're a great infection for that.  I don't want a sugar, man.  You don't pour things on these girls, dude.  We do everything.  I get girls that don't need confectionaries on their pussies.  They taste good naturally.  Because we think pussy tastes good without putting shit on it.  That's because you're boring, man.  Whatever you have to do to make the pussy taste good because you don't like it.  That's boring.  You're doing the same thing every night. 
[03:14:00]  That's why when your girlfriend's fucking you, Anthony, she's closing her eyes and thinking  of his highness.  Oh, really?  Absolutely.  Is that it?  Or in your case, absolutely.  I could think of 10,000 other people they would probably think of before you.  Let me ask the callers, who would they fuck, his highness or Anthony?  Get him on the line.  Get him on the line.  Let's take a poll.  Get him on the line.  They're all men on the line.  All men, they'll go for Anthony.  Hi, this is Brian from Minneapolis. 
[03:14:30]  All right, if you could shut up for a second.  I love Anthony.  Did she really believe that was you?  I'm going to take Anthony to Scandinavia with me.  All right, here's the host.  Hold on, Ian.  You want to talk to some callers?  Mark in Indiana.  Mark.  Yeah, man.  You got these women sitting on your lap.  You're a true pimp, dude.  Hey, dude.  You know, that's the nicest thing you've ever told me, Mark.  And I'll tell you one thing right now.  I know you're unemployed, broke, and living vicariously through his highness, but any time  you're in Manhattan, dude, come look me up, and we'll go out for coffee with the goddesses.  If you want to meet the girls, just walk around the street, you'll find them. 
[03:15:00]  You'll find us kicking his ass.  Hold on.  Oh, no, you didn't.  I just want to profess my love to my goddesses live.  Wait, Mark has something else for you.  Hold on.  Just let me.  I love you both so dearly.  Oh, yeah.  You make every second worth of money.  Actually, he meant to say, I love you both. 
[03:15:30]  You're very dear.  Look, they can't even look in his eyes.  They look down because it's uncomfortable for them to.  Mark.  I got something for the goddesses.  Yes.  All right, ladies.  So, you got your master's degrees, right?  That's amazing.  And you're using them how?  By sitting on some douchebags' laps?  Oh, man.  He's calling you out.  All I have to do is be hot.  It's called having fun again.  I don't have to fucking work like you.  It's called having fun.  It's a fucking job.  Just because you have to the master's doesn't mean you have to be a stick.  It's called having fun. 
[03:16:00]  I'm going to have to the master's because you probably won't be making a job.  more money, so they should do this.  I'm going to talk to you like you're real people for a second.  You're saying this is the best you can do doing a master's, just so everyone knows.  Yeah, that's the best you can do these days in this economy.  All you have to do is be hot.  Class of 2012.  Mine's still in progress.  Okay, thank you.  Let's say for a second that you are hot.  You're saying all you have to do is hot.  You're not going to be hot forever.  So, what's after?  We have a master's.  You don't need to be hot forever.  Duh.  This is fun.  Until then, I'm going to have a good time. 
[03:16:30]  We don't need it.  We have a master's right now.  It doesn't matter.  Good degrees, sweetheart.  Once you're 40, you're on the fucking pile if you haven't already joined the workforce.  Who said you didn't work?  Who said that?  You're working right now.  I've been working right now.  Yeah, when they were 40.  Yeah, dude.  They did hold up pretty good by 40.  See, how many kids am I supporting?  Oh, yeah.  We will have babies together.  Five of them are already dead from crack.  Oh, Jesus.  Again, why was I attacked as the racist of this show? 
[03:17:00]  I didn't say anything about color.  I just said that the girls look like...  I didn't say anything about color.  Jim, when was the last time you blocked...  Why has it always got to come to race?  When was the last time you banged some hot chocolate?  Me, yesterday, and then the day before that.  Yeah.  I believe you.  In his mind.  Me?  No.  I literally...  I just...  You look like a guy who doesn't lie.  I'd like to keep it that way.  Yeah.  Mine was Haitian.  You're not the only oil derrick in this place. 
[03:17:30]  You can't even get homeless from the Congo, Jim.  Oh, shit.  Apparently you can't.  In the Congo, you rape.  You know, Jim would be the only guy going to the Congo  and going home with a hand on his dick at night.  Jesus.  Jesus.  I don't want to...  You want to come to the Congo with me, Jim?  Is Congo a nightclub?  Yeah, I think he's talking about  the horribly impoverished, war-torn country  where everyone's raped and everyone has AIDS.  I've got gigs tonight.  If it's nightclub, I want to go on.  I think they call them goddesses while they do it, 
[03:18:00]  so it's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  They're goddesses over there  as they're cutting their clit off  with a fucking garden weasel.  Wait, wait.  With a garden weasel.  Wait, anyone could have said scissors  and you would fucking...  With a rusty machete would have been enough for me.  Oh, no, but a garden weasel.  They do it over there in the Congo.  It's the fucking cap from the sacred Coca-Cola bottle  from the gods must be crazy in a rock.  Yeah, that's all. 
[03:18:30]  That's surgical equipment over there.  Yes, Ian.  No, I don't want to go to the Congo.  I just want to thank you again for a beautiful morning.  And I want to thank you  because, you know what?  It was nice looking up that girl's skirt this whole time.  It really was.  It might have been for you.  I was closer.  The smell's been horrific.  Maybe she closed your mouth.  Holy shit.  That's hilarious.  I'm not posting that stereotype now, are you?  Oh, Ian.  Oh, Ian, what's he saying?  No, they're diamonds, man.  They're beautiful.  They've got the nicest snatches you can imagine. 
[03:19:00]  They're like silk.  And I'll say one thing about both of them.  Give me a little kiss here, baby.  Can I say a lot of those pussy rules depend on diet.  I just got to say, these women are just angels.  They're goddesses.  It looks so natural when you guys kiss.  It looks so natural and comfortable when you guys are kissing.  Do you just say that you're really wrong?  Why don't you kiss him with your tongue?  Look what she bought me for my birthday.  What?  Oh, really?  A big watch, and I assume you'll lose up one of them. 
[03:19:30]  That's great.  Would you get that when the John was sleeping?  You got it.  You got it.  That's how they make their money, stealing jewelry off wrists.  Oh, my God.  How much of that came out of Charlie Sheen's home?  I think it's time.  I was only going to get Shaq to give it to Kurt, but I think I'm going to get Shaq to give  it to behind.  How much of that used to belong to Charlie Sheen's goddesses?  Opie's immune.  Opie's cold people.  Why are you so obsessed with gay sex, Ian?  It's weird.  They're obsessed with gay sex.  No, you're obsessed with gay sex.  They're obsessed with gay sex.  Come on, so kiss these girls with tongue.  Like, give them a real passion. 
[03:20:00]  You don't have the truth, because we're pecking.  We're not doing the real thing.  Don't prove it to me.  Prove it to him so he doesn't have to act this way.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.  He can stop being this way if you prove you love him now.  You're perfect for radio, dude.  Are you going to do the eye, but I have a look for radio?  You got a radio look, dude.  Okay.  Ian, do you have a boner right now?  You want to feel it?  I don't know.  Try it.  Try it.  Jim Jeffries will.  I'll feel it.  If you've got one, come on.  If you've got one.  Come on over.  I've got two girls saying, I will put my hand on your crotch if you have a boner.  Get up, Jim Jeffries.  Get up.  You don't have a boner. 
[03:20:30]  You ain't going to touch his highness's crotch.  You're going to get it from Shaq.  I'm going to get my friend Shaquille O'Neal to give it to you from behind before we go.  Everyone's getting fucked in the ass by Shaquille for some reason.  Shaq can give it to you.  He used to give it to Shawnee.  I'm saying that these girls can't give you an erection.  Shawnee lives in my building.  Come on, clutch.  I fuck you in the air.  Jim, get up and feel the boner.  These girls can't give him an erection.  No.  No way in the world, bro.  Or anyone with tits.  It's not going to happen for you. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  How do you girls know when the time is up?  That's why they gave Ian the big watch.  So they can see the hands from anywhere.  It can't be after it comes.  You'll be living with him for the rest of your life.  Man, these guys are all going home alone with their hands on their small bricks.  Tell them what we're going to do the rest of the day.  Hold on.  She's going to tell you what we're going to do the rest of the day.  This is how his highnesses live. 
[03:21:30]  They're not traitors, right?  We're going to watch I Love Lucy and we're going to frolic in the bed.  I Love Lucy.  I'm amazed at that.  What is frolic?  We like old stuff.  We like old stuff.  That's right.  Black and white on the bed and the TV.  Yeah, frolic.  Look it up in the dictionary.  We're going to go back and watch My Fair Lady as he cries to show tunes.  Old Jewish guy accents.  Yeah, that's fantastic.  Old Garment District accents.  Why don't you watch Burst of a Nation and fuck her from behind?  Rob's yelling retribution. 
[03:22:00]  Would you fuck Lucy?  Lucy looks a bit like Opie.  Lucy looks like Opie.  Where the fuck does he come out with that?  Seriously, I've never seen them together.  That was just dumb.  Lucy came back as Opie.  Jesus Christ.  That was just dumb.  Oh, God.  Yeah, no, I don't know.  That wasn't even funny.  Yeah, it was just dumb.  That was ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  Some of these listeners are even worse than I am, by the way.  Well, they want to know if they're trannies.  I just want to get to know.  No, they're not trannies.  Look at the Adam's apple.  Look at the Adam's apple.  Someone's actually asking if Ian has to paint his dick yellow before they'll suck it. 
[03:22:30]  What does that mean?  What?  It's a horribly racist joke.  Oh, I thought it was like when you send a canary into a cave to save them.  That makes no sense.  Yeah, what does that mean?  I get the canary thing.  That's great.  But what is the...  Mine was more abstract.  I was going to take Jim and Kurt to the final taping of Oprah, which I'm attending at the  United Center, but they're losing their appeal.  There's a banana joke. 
[03:23:00]  I didn't know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why would I want to go to the final recording of Oprah?  Because you've never been on the show, dude, and the scientists can get you on the show.  I never wanted to be on Oprah.  And people will finally hear of you except for ten douches outside Caroline's.  So let's just review your dream life that you lead.  Jim's cool.  I've watched you a shit sitcom I never enjoyed.  Jim's got a legion of fans.  He's followed by something called frolicking, which is probably you just showing them shit  you bought them.  Oprah's hot, brother.  Followed by going on another show I never gave a shit about.  Like, I don't envy any part of your life, dude. 
[03:23:30]  Not one part of this looks fine.  I know.  That's because you like being broke.  You like living in a shack.  Honestly, God, my life is awesome.  And you like to have your hand on your dick and try to suck it every night.  That's a good life.  And you're collecting social security while you're working under the table at Caroline's.  I like how you guys, you like to have your hand on your dick.  And I also love that.  Who doesn't like that?  How do you think I'm going to go for this show?  You're a guy with small hands, small feet.  Other men hate this.  That says a lot.  My hands and feet are huge. 
[03:24:00]  Let me see the hands.  He does have big hands.  He almost has down-sounds and grass.  You can say what you want about Kurt, but he has the hands of a retarded man with growth.  He looks like a homo erectus, Kurt.  You know, I don't even think Kurt's well from this world.  Well, that's homo erectus as a man, so what are you talking about?  And once again, homo.  You want to know what he wanted to see in his hands?  He loves just getting into the homo erectus.  He wanted to see if one of them would fit up his ass.  Kurt in school?  Does he even get a little kinky, girls?  Does he want you to strap one on? 
[03:24:30]  Let's walk down Times Square.  I'll walk down with these two douches.  Right down Times Square.  Let's see who gets recognized more.  Can I tell you?  In Times Square.  I'll tell you what.  I'll come up to you.  I go, we love you, Andrew Dice Clay.  I bet you all get recognized.  Can I tell you something?  The black girl that I banged for free by the way?  The black girl that I just banged for free?  She puts a vibrator on my nuts, dude, while she blows me.  Whoa.  Do these goddesses do that?  That's crazy.  Do they put a vibrator on your nuts?  On your nuts while she's fucking...  No, you don't need a vibrator.  Obviously, you don't need it.  What is it to get it up? 
[03:25:00]  Like, what is he doing?  I put a picture of loot for Rigno in front of his face while I blow him.  You need technology.  Your kindness just uses physiology, but you're using modern, sophisticated technology.  No, this black girl date, dude, was awesome.  What I'm saying is, it's an extra little twist.  She did that for free, dude.  Right, for free.  See, I play saxophone.  No, she just did it.  I'm trying to explain it to you.  And I'm good with my mouth.  Is that what they call it in the homosexual community?  Playing the old saxophone.  I don't know what you call it.  Jack-jim-a-phone.  Jack-jim-a-phone. 
[03:25:30]  Yes, yes.  He's a saxophone.  That's all you need to know.  I mean, fingering, blowing.  Yeah.  Fingering.  You're so convincing.  Blowing, spitting.  Give some of that money.  All right, let's stop all this schoolyard humor.  Let's get through this.  Let me give a plug for my film tonight.  TV Guy Channel, 10 o'clock, 9 p.m. Central.  Oh, my God.  People are going to be looking to see what else is on anyway.  It'll just come on.  Dude, stop interrupting me.  Literally, people are going to turn on the TV to see what's on.  And they'll just be there.  I'll actually promote my film so my bank account could keep killing yours. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  TV Guy Channel tonight.  These chicks don't come cheap.  Do Jews really do that?  They do.  10 p.m. Eastern Time, 9 p.m. Central Time.  It's called Charlie Sheen, Hollywood Black Book.  And this is His Highness checking out of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's been great.  I love these guys.  I'm going to nominate.  There's only one other DJ, I believe, too, to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It's my good friend Joey Reynolds and the late Wolfman Jack.  And I want all of ONA's listeners to get them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. 
[03:26:30]  Let's go on a campaign.  Let's get on that website and nominate them.  Thank you, Your Highness.  Thank you.  Always a pleasure, baby.  Your Highness, please don't beat me up outside.  Anthony, if you were three years younger, I'm the doctorate.  I got your back, Kurt.  I got your back.  Thank you, sir.  Your Highness, can you forgive me for before and not to have me with your karate?  I imagine Your Highness fighting you out on the street will be like this scene from West Side Story.  A lot of dancing.  I like to live in America.  Your Highness, can you please also not have your friend, Shaq, reap my ass. 
[03:27:00]  What are the goddesses that are going to sing?  I hear they're very rhythmical.  Imagine if he had such a good friend that he could get him to fuck you in the ass.  That's a good friend.  You always bring Shaquille O'Neal into it.  Because I might have played my last game for the Celtics.  I'm at the end of the career.  I've got nothing to do.  What am I going to do?  Rape Kurt. 
[03:27:30]  That's fucking helping you move.  You've got to get out of the house.  You've got to do something.  You can't retire.  Are you going to watch my film tonight?  No.  Why not?  Oh yeah, you go to sleep like 7.30 or something to wake up for this miserable low-paying show.  I'll be on the Crossword Puzzle channel.  And by the way, today's Friday.  He doesn't even have to be up and he's still going to watch your shitty fucking program.  By the way, great job releasing that three weeks after anybody gives a shit about the Shaq.  We killed Bin Laden.  All this shit is happening. 
[03:28:00]  Dude, I was losing.  Dude, if Bin Laden wasn't dead, I'd replace him with Shaq.  You should do an inside story on Bin Laden.  He's dead.  Why don't you do that?  He's gone.  Yeah, yeah.  A bunch of infiltration.  He dumped his body.  The way they're going to dump yours in the ocean is the last Western journalist to talk to Charlie Sheen.  Oh, that would be great.  Just watching his head get sawn off by O'Chair.  By the way, Aston Kutcher is replacing Charlie Sheen on Two and a Half Men.  Aston Kutcher is replacing Charlie Sheen on Two and a Half Men.  Is that a done deal?  Yes.  It's in every paper today, Ian. 
[03:28:30]  But Ian's saying it's definite.  It's a done deal.  Done deal.  It is a done deal.  Oh, boy, you're really killing us with this gossip.  Which gives me more time to bang them.  Tell me, is there a royal couple getting married?  Yeah.  And Bin Laden's about to be killed.  And then he's going to give it to you up the ass before he dies.  That's his death wish.  Oh, shit.  And then we're going to both throw you off the plank.  You're going right into the deep blue sea, baby.  And then two sharks are going to be munching on your crotch.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm retired from comedy.  One shark on Bin Laden.  One shark on your fucking small dick. 
[03:29:00]  I'm just being burned so much.  Right in the deep blue sea.  How do you top it?  You're right.  I can't come back.  You are the highest.  Jim, give me a kiss on the lips.  On the lips.  Let's see.  Have you ever given a man a kiss?  I don't particularly want to, you fucking homo.  Give me a kiss, baby.  It's either me, a kiss on the lips, or Shaq giving it to you from behind.  I got it.  Take Shaq.  Why did the boy have to choose?  I'm teasing.  I've never kissed Jim, man.  Look at all those marks on his lips. 
[03:29:30]  I wouldn't mind.  He's clean.  He's the only guy I know with stretch marks on his lips.  Oh, wow.  No, you didn't even go there.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  And I tell you, those girls have got stretch marks on their lips.  Oh, God.  Can you imagine?  All that Shaquille cop going in there?  With fucking flaps hanging off him?  Oh, yeah.  Imagine that.  I think that would be the biggest.  These girls are in for such a treat later.  The biggest YouTube video would be Shaq.  Someone said the end one.  Shaq giving it to Jim from here.  That would go viral.  I don't think you know how YouTube works. 
[03:30:00]  They're not allowed to have sexual content on their site.  Yes, you can if you click.  The joke's on you.  No, no.  The joke's on you, bro.  Wow.  If you click up on 18 and over and you give your email and password, you're in.  I said at last the joke's on you.  Ah, so now the joke's on you.  I'll take the joke on you.  Guys, who's the joke on you?  No returnsies.  Sorry.  Jim, Jim.  No returnsies.  Jim, you're going to be telling these jokes like George Burns when you're 98 years old.  I'm running your clue.  The same fucking lines.  What you say to me, bounce off me, it sticks to you. 
[03:30:30]  How does it feel going home every day to an empty bank account?  Oh, damn.  Someone dropped the N-bomb.  How does it feel every day going back to an empty soul?  Or to an empty sexuality that you can't live with?  Let me tell you a poem.  Time's the essence, the essence of life.  Immune visions of light.  Your long hair now.  What's the magical mystery prince that danced?  They're looking at their watches.  He's laying there.  This is the one where she puts all the chocolate from the conveyor belt in her mouth.  This is a great one.  Shut up.  Stop talking.  Stop talking.  They shot it all on one camera and one time. 
[03:31:00]  This is great.  Let me tell you about this.  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  What's your name?  Riccardo.  Yeah, yeah.  Ricky Riccardo.  Sam, are you going to be in his highness's next film?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  I'm doing a behind-the-scenes Jesse Arnaz.  It's real topical.  You got it.  See?  You guys know it all.  He's going to follow Shaq around.  You know more about me than my zombie inside documentary.  Yeah.  Fuck, you said it first.  Shaq rape documentary.  Shaq rape documentary. 
[03:31:30]  Shaq rape documentary, yeah.  Are you guys on coke right now?  It's going to be shown on Animal Planet.  Cheap crack?  No.  No.  No, I don't think so.  Some of you look like you're on the load.  Aston Kutcher gets Shane's gig.  It's on the TV.  Now it's official.  Now it's official.  Wow.  Ian Halpern.  Ian Halpern.  That's why they call him his highness.  Ian Halpern.  That's why it's his highness.  Ignore his in every paper today.  Ian Halpern.  Nostradamus.  Nostradamus himself.  You better leave on that note, Ian.  Because I can get on that note.  On that note, we're out of here. 
[03:32:00]  I want to wish everyone good Shabbos.  It's amazing.  Good Shabbos to all my faithful fans.  Nostradamus of Hollywood.  I want to thank Obi and Anthony from the bottom of my heart for letting me promote TV Guide  tonight, 10 p.m., 9 p.m. Central.  Thank you, chicken George.  And it's called Charlie Sheenholl in the black book.  And let the goddesses say one last word.  All right, kids.  Just say what you really feel.  Remember, this is the last time you've ever been on radio.  Say what you actually feel in the world.  Okay.  Let's go.  I don't feel anything.  Of course you do.  You're dead inside.  Of course you don't.  You're with the kids.  You did that to you, your uncle. 
[03:32:30]  Of course you don't.  You don't.  You don't.  I've met a few hookers in my day and feelings in one of their big attributes.  What uncle took the feelings away?  I'm sorry that the N-word was...  These girls aren't hot.  I didn't hear the N-word.  They said the N-word.  I didn't either.  I didn't say the N-word.  I didn't hear it.  Somebody said the N-word.  I think Ian Halperin did.  Let Giselle have a word.  Let her go.  Yes, thank you.  Okay.  I will say it was fun hanging out with you guys.  You're hot.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  I had fun...  Got something to plug?  Ian's an asshole with your fist. 
[03:33:00]  Ian's great.  Let me tell you something.  Ian's great.  Okay.  Your Highness is amazing.  We're going to go to Miami soon.  We're going to have fun.  It's all about having fun.  We have fun.  We're here.  We're having fun.  We're here.  It's early as hell, but we're showing out.  Can you see you one day having a child with this man?  Your life really going that far with him?  I don't know.  Maybe.  I mean, that's the future.  We're living in the present right now.  You've got a master's in liar.  There's like...  There's...  Who knows?  You know what I'm saying? 
[03:33:30]  In the future, who knows what's going to happen?  Would anyone say Ashton Kutcher would be leaving two and a half men?  Like years ago, who would say that?  Yeah, leaving.  Yeah.  He's joining.  Oh, that was as big as 9-11 for me.  Let's remember.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but no one knows what's going to happen in the future.  I remember where I was when I heard him say that.  Oh, I remember where I was as well.  Laughing at a repeat of two and a half men while simultaneously crying.  And I apologize.  Holy shit.  To a certain funny NSAID.  Ian, if they were offended by the N-word, I apologize.  I'm not offended because it's ignorance and I don't... 
[03:34:00]  You know, I don't think...  I ignore ignorance.  Somebody in here said the N-word.  I'm sorry.  Hold on.  I've got to clarify.  Who said...  He's certainly not a racist.  What is this N-word?  I don't believe Anthony's a racist, even though he sounds like one.  Did we call one of them a nincompoor?  These two schlamils I'm not sure about.  I assume you mean nincompoor.  Yeah.  NINCOMPOOR.  Sorry for the N-word.  That was a little ugly in here.  So you're just apologizing because you know I'll go to Al Sharpton and he'll pull a Don Imus  on you guys.  And I would never do that to you guys because I love you guys.  I would thank you.  But tone it down with the racism. 
[03:34:30]  Wow.  Because I could get you off the air in a heartbeat.  Yeah, keep talking.  I will start protests outside this fucking studio with every motherfucking in Harlem,  in Spanish Harlem, in Chicago, in Indiana.  They'll be right here and we'll get you off the air.  But I wouldn't do that to you guys because I love you.  How are you going to get them all together?  How are you going to do that?  Yeah.  You're going to unite the whole black community.  You can't do it on the internet.  Half of them don't have computers.  If Glenn Beck could rally millions in Washington, his highness could certainly get...  Did he get millions? 
[03:35:00]  I don't think he did.  Oh, yes, he did.  If you clapped in all the social media, online viewers, you're talking millions, baby.  You only wish you'd make one day paycheck what Glenn Beck makes.  I really don't.  I really don't give a shit.  You do, dude.  You're so broke.  Are you shitting me, dude?  Dude.  I'm not that...  You know...  Dude, you...  Dude, imagine I don't work.  You look so fucking desperate.  When I came in here, I thought you were homeless.  I was going to give you a few bucks.  What, were you going to start dating him?  I was like, hang on.  Shaq, don't write no homeless, man. 
[03:35:30]  We don't know.  It'll be in the documentary.  We'll find out.  Yeah, it's Charlie Sheen tonight.  That really is the ultimate, like, pathetic fucking...  Yes, baby.  Yes, Anthony.  Why don't you do this, Sophie?  You didn't pay, man.  Hold on.  But do we get paid?  Do the big out.  Do the big out.  Do the big out.  I want to hear from the co-owner.  Oh, it's like, hey, doesn't Hitler suck?  And it's like, well, he making money, though.  He keeps the trains running on time.  But do we make the train run?  Do we get paid?  Hey, do you think slavery's wrong? 
[03:36:00]  Don't hate the playoff.  Hate the game.  That's a good one.  You got me laughing, baby.  Well, it's too bad I'm so broke, man.  I could not probably do these jokes if I had a job or a form of some kind.  It ain't no joke to be stone broke.  Oh, Jesus.  Shalom.  Never heard of you before.  It's amazing.  Let's do some karaoke.  I'm not that broke, dude.  Give me a song.  Yeah, karaoke.  All right, give me some Midnight Train, the Georgia.  No, I'm going to take one of you to take us out with a little. 
[03:36:30]  I'm trying to save me in money, and I'm telling them to leave.  Give me Love Train.  He tries to pay for another hour.  Love Train.  How about I'm in the mood for dancing?  All right.  How about discrepancies?  How about his writing men?  Join hands.  It's a love train.  Love train.  People all the world.  Come on now.  Oh, my God.  Join hands.  Let's hear it.  All right.  Love train.  Come on now.  Yeah, cranky.  I got to hear it.  I will try.  People all the world.  Join hands. 
[03:37:00]  Let's get on beat, guys.  Let's get on beat.  It's just a love train.  Love train.  Form of Shaq train.  People all the world.  Yeah.  Shaq train.  Come on hands.  It's just a love train.  Start a love train.  You already got two porters.  The next time I'm in will be England.  Yeah.  Is that what I call on?  Come on.  Come on.  Come on to Germany.  Tell all the folks in China, in Russia, too.  Yeah.  Shouldn't he be singing the love train right out of the fucking studio?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Take the love train out. 
[03:37:30]  Holy shit.  Get on board now.  Yeah.  Let's sing, baby.  I'd like to sing it right up here.  I hope this derails.  Join hands.  Come on to love train.  Love train.  Come on.  People all the world.  Join hands.  Yeah.  Nobody's coming.  Love train.  Love train.  We're just studying microphones. 
[03:38:00]  That's brothers and women in Africa.  Yeah.  Tell all the folks.  Tell all the folks in Egypt.  Give us that in red.  Not train.  And Israel, my people, too.  When I think about the human Oreo centipede they're going to form later.  What?  Save on the road, man.  That blue road in the end is going to just die.  I'm clapping.  And if you did it, I feel sorry for you.  Actually looks like a broken human now.  As Ian's train goes under the sign that says, R beat, Mock's free. 
[03:38:30]  Look at what it says above his bed.  Ian's bed says, R beat, Mock fry.  Mock fry, yeah.  Oh, he's poor girls.  Ian broke the microphone.  Ian broke the microphone.  Ian, you fucked up.  That makes perfect sense.  The microphone just died.  Don't touch the wet end.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened to his mic.  Yeah, I don't know what happened over there.  Oh, well.  Listen, it happens. 
[03:39:00]  Girls, if you go in his house and you find the remains of the other goddesses in a closet,  just promise me that you will leave and call someone.  And don't be afraid.  And if the goddesses have dildos attached to them like they've got cocks, don't be alarmed.  I don't know what happened to his mic this week.  Well, you know.  Shit happens.  It probably just died.  I want to thank Ian for stopping in today.  What, like those girls' souls?  Ian, do the big out, because you're good with the big out.  Ian, do the big out.  The big plug. 
[03:39:30]  I will get up for you guys.  Oh, here he is.  All right.  The girls are leaving.  Ian's leaving.  Those girls are hot, dude.  I don't know why people are leaving.  Ian, we're all going to be checking out the TV guy's channel.  You don't like this one?  Yeah.  I don't like that one.  All right.  You're listening to Sirius Radio, Opie and Anthony's show.  We're on every morning, Monday to Friday.  Not waiting.  This is how I'm just checking out.  Everyone have a good weekend.  Hope everyone gets laid out there, and to all you people, peace out.  All right.  Big out, Ian.  Big out.  All right.  Thank you.  The comedy stylings of Jim Jones. 
[03:40:00]  We're Caroline's, dude.  Jim Jones and Kurt Metzger.  It's a great show, man.  Caroline's all weekend.  212-757-4100.  Come and see them broke asses doing things and just not getting laid.  Watch it all day.  But they're both brilliant comedians, and I wish them the best.  And I'm big fans of both of them.  Hey, honey, you fell off my lap.  Your soul's everywhere on the floor.  What are you doing this for?  And the encore Shaq fucking you both in the ass.  Yeah, and Shaq is going to come up and fuck him in the ass. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, Mother Hubbard.  Oh.  Who said the N-word, by the way?  I'd stay tuned for my documentary.  I don't remember saying it, but it may have sucked out.  Yeah, you're going to get a Shaq attack.  I didn't think it was me.  Who said the N-word?  Who said the N-word?  That's the only foul.  You hear any N-word.  It's the only foul shot Shaq always makes.  Yes, the one up your ass.  And you say the N-word?  No, I didn't drop the N-bomb.  By the way, do you remember over the last factory when I had that ban the N-word project?  Right, yes.  And I was like, great.  I was like, oh, wait, the word?  Oh, wow. 
[03:41:00]  I did that joke at that club.  Come on, that's great, man.  I did that to them at Times Square Arts Center.  That's funny.  By the way, no one said the N-word.  I was just trying to really get it crazy in here.  Oh, what are you talking about?  I was freaking the fuck out.  I thought they were just going to go.  Because I wanted to say it the whole time.  But maybe you slipped.  I was thinking it a few times.  I didn't know whether my inner voice was my outer voice.  Oh, Ian's back. 
[03:41:30]  We're out.  There goes his highness.  There goes his highness.  It's only fun.  TV Guide channels.  Charlie Sheen will be tonight.  Sounds amazing.  It was fun.  He didn't make that fun.  He's such a cock, isn't he?  He really is.  Isn't he just like...  He drives people nuts.  He's a fan fucking hated.  What he does is you say something off the cuff.  Oh, these are old jokes.  Oh, old jokes.  How did he tell three old jokes?  Yeah, yeah.  He's a...  I understand your dick is two inches from the floor.  You've got stretch marks around your mouth and you're stale. 
[03:42:00]  That was from the Ron Jeremy joke book.  I've been doing a documentary about him and his jokes.  TV Guide channel.  The light one, the darker bird, she seemed to be sort of into...  The crow?  The darker bird.  Do you know that's what a song...  She's the nicer one.  The darker one's the nicer one.  She doesn't fully understand what she...  The other one, she knows what she got into.  She knows what she's into.  When she said, I feel nothing...  And has no regrets.  That was her little telegraph.  I know what this is.  She knows.  The other one felt crushed as a person.  Yeah, she's a nice...  The other one's a nicer girl.  Yes. 
[03:42:30]  Escorts, guys.  Oh, yeah.  They're escorts.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they got into it because I've...  Have you ever been with escorts, but they're not paying for them, but you were their boyfriend?  Wow.  Wow.  If you know...  I can't say that.  Yeah, this girl that I used to see was like that.  And it's funny, man.  They're really like some kind of damaged kids.  Oh, shit.  If you know somebody like that, like, all that shit they do with a guy like that is always  for show.  I mean, they have one guy, they'll be who they are with, right?  And I am broke, by the way, and I've always been that guy. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Even fucking Delfino that was on.  She was a stripper when I met her in Philly, like, paying my way through college.  And I used to go sit at the strip club, and I'd watch these guys give her money, be  her friend.  Did you have a girlfriend?  No, no.  She'd buy me drinks in front of these fucking guys.  Oh, wow.  That are handed her money.  And then we had a computer, because these guys would just drive computers and shit  over, like, and I'd be like, dude, what are you doing?  It's fucking amazing, dude.  And he's that guy.  He's that guy, yeah.  He's that guy.  Well, the thing is, at the beginning, it must feel good when he comes to you and goes, we're 
[03:43:30]  just going to go on a radio show.  You don't even have to fuck me.  And you're going to get paid.  And you just got to sit on my lap.  It's like the first thing he's got to say to them, you don't have to fuck me.  And they're like, well, we don't have to fuck you.  You're like, this is easy money.  And then they get an Australian guy just going, you fucking whore.  And all of a sudden, I would have loved to suck his little due cock.  I would have done it.  And now they're going to ask for more money.  They didn't realize the price they were paying, not fuck it. 
[03:44:00]  They're in the lift right now going, that was horrible.  I feel like one of them is.  I couldn't even make up a degree.  The high yellow one's fine.  I'm as dumb as a rock.  She couldn't make up a master's degree.  She couldn't even think of a subject that they might have a degree in.  I'm not going to tell you.  Yeah, she was going, oh, brickwork.  No, fucking, is lawyer, is that one?  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  I think gun repair was my favorite.  Gun repair. 
[03:44:30]  Is tattooing one?  Can you do it in tattooing?  Yeah, HVAC.  Well, I did get to keep my own set of tools upon graduation.  He's running from the cops into gray.  We're going to start our weekends, boys and girls.  Yeah, what a great Friday, man.  These guys killed for us today, man.  Jim Jeffries and Kurt Metzger, both in Carolina.  Big crew tomorrow night going there, so I can't wait to see you guys.  Excellent, man.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100, but I don't know.  This show's going to sell out, so I'm going to get on the phone immediately.  We were almost sold out last night. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, you believe me.  You're going to fucking sell out.  But no great Charles.  He'll shove some people up against the walls and stuff.  In a good way.  In a good way.  Of course.  In a good way.  That's fucking great, man.  Standing room, it's worth it for these guys, right?  Pisser.  All right.  That was fun, man.  Thanks, guys.  It was a blast.  That's great on the show.  It was awesome.  Come on.  I love that.  I've already lost my voice.  I know.  Just yelling fucking horrid things.  It's great.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I know.  Isn't that sad? 
[03:45:30]  That's so great, dude.  If that wasn't the guy that fucking...  That's better than showing the body.  That is better than showing the fucking body.  It is.  To see what he's really like, that's more humiliating.  Look at the extension cords on the walls.  He had 700 euros strapped to his body just in case he had a fleece.  That's like 1,000 American dollars.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like...  How long is he going to go with that?  I know you can go pretty far in Pakistan and watch a couple of cricket games along the  way.  You're not getting on the tube in London for that big boy.  No, no. 
[03:46:00]  Ah, shit.  Yeah, that's...  I always think all dictators...  If you wouldn't want to be a dictator, it always ends up with you in a hole with a  briefcase full of cash.  Just going, I used to live in a castle.  I used to fucking have a castle.  What the fuck?  What the fuck happened?  I like how Osama lives in the homeless.  Guys, where's my curly slippers?  I had golf carts, everything.  I haven't eaten Turkish Delight for fucking months. 
[03:46:30]  This is bullshit.  Dude, did you notice that...  I played one prank on New York, and now...  I'm in a hole.  Now I'm in a hole with money strapped to my chest, and I'm dying my beard.  I got a 1973 Zenith television in front of me.  Dude, his house looked like the house those girls grew up in.  I always think when they found Saddam Hussein in that hole, it looked like that scene from  The Life of Brian, where they found the guy with the juniper bushes. 
[03:47:00]  The fucking call.  This is a great video.  You ever see that What's Osama been watching?  You could put in the URL of a YouTube video, and it comes up on the television.  Oh, really?
