<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began by excitedly announcing their upcoming guests: Bill Burr, Ginger Lynn, Mick Foley, and Chris Morris.  A large segment of the broadcast focused on a review and preview of the British comedy "Four Lions," a film depicting four inept suicide bombers.  Opie and Anthony lauded the film's dark humor, contrasting it with what they perceived as the overly politically correct nature of American comedy.  They debated the film's potential reception in the US, acknowledging the controversial subject matter.  The hosts also discussed their frustrations with YouTube's censorship policies, citing examples where their own videos were removed while content from radical Muslim clerics remained online.  Their conversation veered into anecdotes about their interactions with billionaires, a documentary they'd seen about evangelical Christians in the Midwest, and their surprising enjoyment of a Christian comedian.  Throughout the show, Opie and Anthony employed frequent use of vulgar language and offensive jokes.

[00:02:30]  talk to this guy i thought it was just a basic booking uh there's a movie out called four lions  we got an advanced copy i i watched it jimmy watched it and uh and sammy uh watched it there  and man what a great fucking movie huh i had heard about this uh it's about four let's just say four  bungling suicide bombers and it's a comedy and ain't from from england and i remember we had talked  about it right six months ago which meant i don't know if that meant it was out or if that was just a 
[00:03:00]  little trailer they were showing for it well i would imagine it's the type of movie that's gotta have  like a grassroots thing happening to it you can't just shove this into a million movie theaters no  this this should be in every theater in the country it's fucking hilarious it's british it's a british  comedy it's that british hilarious yeah and uh america pc no america uh just doesn't make comedies  like like they like they do in britain i don't hold back as much in britain in general and for them  is like black and white is here like they're they're even more pc with islam in britain than they 
[00:03:30]  are here so this is even more amazing that this guy did this i think he i'm guessing he did he did  do it in england fucking it restored my faith in comedies i love i love this movie loved it i was  thinking that like like england is worse when it comes to uh placating to the muslims than we are here  yeah much uh so how how do they get away with that and do you think this would uh widespread in  the u.s like opening in in a lot of theaters do you think a lot of people would be like oh oh what 
[00:04:00]  is uh like not get it it's not it's not it's very dialogue heavy as far as the humor which is great  uh really funny bungling moments that are just bumbling idiots they're idiots and but they they  believe in their cause they believe in their cause they're they're jihadists and uh i won't give  it away but they're looking for a place to blow themselves up that's what they're looking for  yeah uh and that's what the movie's about these four guys five guys one of them is pretty smart 
[00:04:30]  the guy was kind of running and the frustration he has with dealing with these fucking idiots  trying to get them into a training camp in afghanistan and they really good man they fucked  that up we could say that much they fucked up a lot they fucked up uh their training overseas they  had to come back home with a with an excuse of what went wrong so then they decide they're going  just do it locally yeah that he just yeah he just decides to i will do this really great though  and they all have just info that's wrong  i'll have to check that out i do i could not recommend a comedy higher than this yeah i uh i 
[00:05:00]  loved it i loved it i don't want to give too much away it's only opening in new york and la i think  which again it's depressing that a great comedy like this well they're going to see how the numbers do  and if if enough people go out and see it which i doubt will happen unfortunately because the  movie's getting great reviews on rotten tomatoes uh then they would open it other places it's really  smart it's really different um and there's a couple of great moments it's just really it's not just 
[00:05:30]  dialogue i mean there's some really funny shit and there's some things that happen in this that  you'll probably never see happen no in an american comedy ever yeah ever no uh can we talk about the  neighbor the woman um yeah i think so sure just giving away the one thing where they're they're  going to their sort of like hideout to you know plot and plan a little bit and the neighbor catches  them so they kind of have to admit they're all gay and they're going to have gay sex because they 
[00:06:00]  don't want anyone onto them because she also goes you're you guys are gay she's like no i know what  this is and they got like chemicals in the room and there's five islamic men it's like i know what  this is they're like uh and then you're thinking they're going to kill her right and she's like  you're all and she's she's you're all packing something like she used the word for fag in  england right right and and the guy's like uh he's the guy's like yeah we're gay we are we are it was  very fucking funny man but they all five these islamic jihadists had to pretend they were homos 
[00:06:30]  yeah really good just to protect their plan yeah i think this guy did a lot of things that would  really upset islamic oh yeah yeah well we're gonna have to ask him about that yeah there's no way  this went completely unnoticed it couldn't have 87 positive reviews on rotten tomatoes which means  it'll do 500 people in the theaters because i love it so much no kidding yeah yeah because we love to  observe and rapport and that did nothing in the theaters and it was way better than mall cop  i never saw a lot of cop but i just i tried mall cop i tried it yeah i i didn't get to the hour mark 
[00:07:00]  before i had to leave and i was really trying to get through the entire movie i really was yeah  but uh observe and rapport way better mall movie than the fucking mall cop sorry adam ferrara we  love you is he in that yeah and ellis mate was in there as well and he knows i told him kevin is  i like kevin a lot too it doesn't matter he don't care i mean he was in a blockbuster movie  what do we know we're stupid we're the ones that are stupid not everyone that went and enjoyed the  movie right yeah i believe um oddly enough england is trying to get a bunch of youtube videos removed 
[00:07:30]  of radical muslim clerics uh spouting their shite that's why that's a weird line too man so uh  yeah yeah opie's videos it's what you pointed this out it's your video couldn't be on youtube  islamic clerics are on youtube yeah i've had a bunch banned over the last year that guarantee  that some of youtube it just doesn't like you know bill schultz that you do red eye with i showed  his open wound in his back remember that fucking thing that could have been mercer or whatever it was 
[00:08:00]  nasty fucking wound i shot that they yanked that one as well because somebody i think somebody  yanked that but they allow this shit on on youtube somebody doesn't like you at youtube if that's  personal guaranteed that's personal yeah whatever i mean you don't mean that has to be just doesn't  make sense no it doesn't make sense but they are their own entity they could do whatever the fuck  they want yeah it's but it's really annoying sucks yeah we drank with the fucking uh guys that  started youtube in vegas the little asian guy yeah i'm sure and they're editing all the videos 
[00:08:30]  no of course yeah but if you get in touch with him though it might help i forgot his name no i think  he uh i think he sold yeah it was bobby lee it was bobby lee yeah and bobby lee is fucking  crazy yeah he's out of his fucking mind he sold youtube like four years ago we were drinking  with him right around the time he was selling and becoming a like multi-billionaire or something  we always get to to party with the billionaires for a moment or two yeah for a second big price 
[00:09:00]  line i've never met a billionaire to my knowledge oh really no they're assholes i'm i think probably  and utter assholes are they they don't share they don't share any of their money with anybody  we were paying for the drinks hello you're gonna make a fucking billion dollars tomorrow  how about you buy around really i don't know i don't even remember i'm so stupid and gullible  making shit up for the radio i hate myself really no we did hang out we did hang out with him he and  drink a little bit with the guy but whatever i was watching a documentary about the evangelicals 
[00:09:30]  on hbo and and oh my god just the midwest and and what's what's going on that it was just these uh  these people driving through and and videotaping all these giant crosses and the lord will come  giant billboards everywhere and then going to these church things that are in 35 000 seat arenas  where uh a minister whatever it is gets up there starts yapping and and the people do that look they 
[00:10:00]  put their arms up shut their eyes and look up at a big smile on their face and and and then they ask  you know why does everybody look so happy and and they answer like well we know that uh life is  eternal through jesus and um we have great family lives and bloody bloody blah right and why wouldn't  anybody be happy and they got to put a little disclaimer at the bottom that one of the ministers  they were talking to was uh removed for sexual misconduct it's just like of course he was 
[00:10:30]  of course he was they all look like these creepy ghoulish something's fucking wrong with the white  guys black guys i did not see one black fellow in the entire wow uh documentary the the best though  was uh because they show you know everybody knows about christian rock bands and whatnot uh the best was  jimmy the the christian comic this guy was a hoot oh we got let me tell you was he funny so so let's play some 
[00:11:00]  clips of this yeah i would love to hear the christian comic the christian comic how do we hear this guy  uh he's probably on there yeah but is that guy he's got a little spiky hairdo or something  he's uh he's he's like preaching and just because of the way he's delivering it he thinks it's funny  is it and the people in the crowd like no are they laughing yes is it i don't think i don't know if 
[00:11:30]  that's him you got to realize i grew up ultra conservative christian um very very conservative  like we didn't it's like that's been cool about traveling around and seeing different churches and  how people worship god again the creativity of god is amazing um you know like i've never seen  anybody sing with their hands up till the first tour we were talking about during the break but  the first tour i did was with clay cross and i i did a 15 minute bit and i started walking up the  the aisle and clay got up and started singing i surrender all and i remember walking by this lady 
[00:12:00]  who was so lost in worship that she was singing with her hands up lifting holy hands of god and i  never seen that before when i walked by her and i just you know didn't know what she was doing  i know i thought she wanted a high five  that's that's that's your  Thank you. </pre>
