<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the "After ONA Live" segment hosted by Sam Roberts.  This segment featured a studio discussion with Bob Kelly and other unnamed individuals. Sam attempted, unsuccessfully, to engage the studio personnel in conversation.  The discussion then veered into Bob Kelly's surprisingly high tolerance for various bodily fluids—boogers, cysts, and pus—though not feces. Sam recounted his recent Netflix viewing, which included movies and wrestling documentaries.  A purported ghost encounter experienced by Bob Kelly, involving a recording of a voice possibly saying "Paul," was debated.  A lengthy, humorous, and vulgar hypothetical horror movie plot was devised, culminating in Sam's character's death and Bob Kelly's survival.  Bob Kelly's resemblance to wrestler Lord Tensai was noted, leading to a detailed and morbid discussion of the Von Erich wrestling family's history and the tragic deaths of multiple family members.  Several studio interactions occurred, including some people walking out, and an intern's repeated failure to recall the show's content.  The segment was rife with crude humor and vulgar language.

The show then transitioned to a segment focusing on professional wrestling.  The hosts reminisced about the Freebirds wrestling team and discussed the dire health situation of Kamala, a wrestler known for wrestling barefoot, highlighting the amputation of his right leg and the impending amputation of his left foot.  They lamented the lack of financial security and support many wrestlers face post-career.  The conversation shifted to the current state of the wrestling industry, contrasting the past's lack of opportunity with the present's improved financial prospects for wrestlers. Edge's retirement and his unconcerned attitude towards potential acting roles were mentioned.  Anthony promoted his upcoming stand-up shows in Chicago and his podcast. The segment concluded with a brief mention of Carly Rae Jepsen's recent studio visit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Serious XM  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  There's a party going on in here.  We're on the air.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I hope he's still in here, but I don't know if he knows we're on the air.  He's turning around and walking out. 
[00:00:30]  You failed.  I failed at what?  At what?  If I say, then you win.  I'm going to acknowledge that.  You were trying to engage all the people that were in the studio to continue with you,  and everyone ignored what you just said.  Who specifically do you think I was trying to engage the most?  I'll talk to you.  I'm already saying that I'm going to lose by bringing this up.  Opie and Jim. That's two.  You didn't fall for it. I didn't fall for it.  It looks like you did.  I didn't fall for it.  How are you doing, Steve? 
[00:01:00]  He's just staring a hole through me.  You're alone today, sir.  No, no, no.  Jim.  You touching Bob Kelly all day today was my favorite thing to watch.  People didn't even pick up on it.  Oh, he's walking out.  Danny.  Danny, you're going to follow suit, huh?  You son of a bitch.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  To find out what did you learn. 
[00:01:30]  Eric's just pointing at people.  Sal.  Eric is now the opposite.  Oh, the interns are coming.  Oh, Bobby's coming back, Kim.  Yeah, call me up and tell me what did you learn today.  Today I learned that Bob Kelly is okay with boogers and cysts and pus.  It's just shitting assholes he doesn't like.  He's okay with everything else.  But now, Eric, did you know that Bob Kelly was not okay? 
[00:02:00]  I mean, of course, we all knew that he was not okay with shitting assholes.  But I thought that he was going to puke when he saw that booger video.  I thought so, too.  We all learned something.  Bob, we were all very surprised today.  Why?  We didn't know that you were okay with boogers and stuff like that.  I mean, I wouldn't be okay, I don't think, live.  But I used to eat boogers.  You did? For how long?  I was a booger eater.  I didn't eat them.  I actually just licked them and wet them and sculpted them into a perfect pearl. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, that was my, you know, people, I told you, I said this on the air before.  Yeah?  Yeah, I used to, instead of sucking my thumb, I would suck my two fingers, pick my nose, and roll the booger on my upper lip.  I thought, yeah, that's so gross, dude.  Yeah.  Would you do it now?  I used to save boogers.  Where?  Like, I'd pick, like, in the morning, like, if I had a good one, I'd pick it and put it under a desk, or under a railing, and then run home after school and peel it. 
[00:03:00]  No, it'd be there.  Oh, God.  And peel it off?  Yeah, we didn't have a maid.  It wasn't like the fucking house was closed.  What did you do?  I'd take it off, and then fucking put it back, and then roll it up, and...  Oh, you'd play with it, like, hours later.  Play with it again.  Hours later.  It was like a toy.  That's disgusting.  I had a kid from a poor family.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, we had to...  Oh.  A couple people...  You say potato, I say potato.  I guess so.  Yeah.  Nate, you know, I stole the what did you learn bit.  You know, Opie and Anthony used to do it?  Yep.  At the end of the show? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, of course I know it.  I've been here longer than you.  Well, you're looking at me with a blank face, like, uh, yep, as long as there's no follow-up  questions.  Everybody looks at you with a blank face.  Well, why is that?  I don't know, but my phone is gone.  Oh.  I got it.  It should be in your bandolier.  Why did you put it in your pocket?  Because I was using it.  I was playing chess, uh, chess, chess with friends.  Bob is walking around with his bandolier on.  I can't help it.  What am I going to do?  Carry it?  But he's putting, but he's putting his phone in his pocket.  You also, you didn't have to leave.  I don't know why everybody looked at you like the bosses looked at you like it was  weird for you to be in here during the commercial day. 
[00:04:00]  No, I don't like being, I don't like hearing any of that secret shit.  There was no secret shit.  But even if, if there was or wasn't, I don't like hearing, you know, any secret shit.  I don't want to know anything.  You just want to be on the air.  I don't know.  I just don't want, it's none of my business.  I don't want to know shit because then if somebody, if something was said and it was  leaked and I'm the only asshole and I'm the one who, yeah, I'm getting assassinated.  But all that's going to get leaked is like Roland mumbling through guest pitches  and stuff like that.  Yeah.  I don't want to know who he likes and who he doesn't like.  None of it.  No, because then I know that it happens with me and you guys go, plus then if one of us leaks 
[00:04:30]  it, we could be like, I don't know, Bob Kelly was in here.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It all comes back.  Yeah.  You guys can wrap me up.  Um, anyways, dude, I want to talk about the fucking, what do you want to talk about?  I want to talk about this goddamn, the triumph and tragedy of the world-class championship  wrestling.  Really?  It, I watched, first of all, Netflix is ruining my life.  How's it like Netflix?  The iPad, the iPad is ruining my life.  I'll say the iPad.  Because Netflix doesn't have that much stuff on it.  Yeah.  But that's the problem. 
[00:05:00]  I'm watching shit.  Just because.  This is, of course, this is the dumbest intern that we have right now.  It's all right.  He just knocked his head.  Wait, wait, watch it.  What did you learn on the show today?  That puss is salty.  Again, from the last half hour of the show.  He doesn't listen to the show ever.  Like, you think I'm bad writing notes during the show?  This intern, I ask him every day, what did you learn on the show today?  This is Jeff Spicoli, the intern.  And he doesn't remember.  Yeah, he's the shitty intern, but he's a good human being because he doesn't listen  to the show.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not corrupting him. 
[00:05:30]  Um, so what, so yeah, Netflix, cause you're, so you just end up watching shit because you  have the ability to.  First of all, did I just step on this whole, what did you learn bit that you're trying to  do?  We do it every day.  It's enough.  Um, yeah, well, Netflix, it's this, there's not that much good stuff on it, but there's  a lot of shit movies, a lot of shit documentaries and you'll watch them.  Cause it's all, it's, I know it's not free.  Technically you're paying eight bucks a month.  So it's almost more.  So you have to get your money's worth.  Like I gotta get my eight bucks a month worth. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  But it's like at, at two in the morning, you know, when you put a, a, one of those  WWE fucking things on it, you just watch it.  You can't not watch it.  Like they're kind of documentaries, but half of them are done in the wrestling characters.  So you don't like, it's like.  Yeah.  Well they did.  They just have a curtain in the background and a light and they have Mick Foley.  He probably wailed out around nine of them in a day.  That's it.  You could tell that they just sit Mick Foley down for like nine hours and just have them  talk about everything conceivable that they might do a DVD about. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Cause he's tired by, and some of them he's tired.  I don't know.  I mean, Rod, he was cool.  He was good.  Uh, Piper's pit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm tired.  He's a good guy.  You know, I don't know what you want from me right here, but, uh, cause so that's what  you watch wrestling documentaries.  Well, I, well, the, the, they, they, they have a lot of good.  This one was great though.  I got, I mean, stings was the worst I've ever seen.  I watched that cause you called in when I was doing the Saturday show.  You called in, you said, you got to watch it.  So I watched it.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  It was the worst thing.  If any of you have Netflix go on, it's called like sting moment of truth or something like  that.  It's terrible.  It's a TNA thing.  No, it's a, it's a sting documentary that I think an independent one.  He made himself.  Oh yeah.  Cause sting is in it and it's like, it's told through a college newspaper reporter that  somehow has access to backstage at the big wrestling match.  And he goes in with sting makeup on to do a college newspaper interview with sting. 
[00:07:30]  And sting does it now tells the story of his entire career.  That's normal.  Yeah.  It's all.  I'm just going to give you a rundown of what I've watched the last few days.  Please do.  Okay.  Ready?  Here we go.  You're ready.  Okay.  So we get psych, which is my, I love that.  Favorite show.  One of my favorite shows on TV.  It's on USA Wednesday night.  Tonight is the last episode of the season.  Is that upset you?  It's a, no, I, and it's coming back.  It got picked up already.  Nice.  Fucking funny show.  All right.  Very funny. 
[00:08:00]  Uh, then I, the rise and fall of the Irishman, the gun down.  What's what is the gun down?  Yeah.  The rise and fall of the Irishman was a documentary about the, you ever see the  Irishman, that movie that just came out about, I don't know, the angry Irishman  or whatever the fuck it was called documentary about this Irish guy in Cleveland or some  shit.  Then the gun down.  One of the worst fucking Westerns I've ever seen.  And this is all just because you have access to it.  Yes.  Cause the girl had fake lips and fake tits.  It's like, they didn't have that back then.  In a Western.  Yeah.  You can't be Angelina Jolie lips and have fake tits. 
[00:08:30]  And it wasn't even attractive.  Even if you could have that then, it wasn't attractive then.  Yeah.  Like they had a whole different set of standards.  Yeah.  Like a fat bitch back then.  Most of the bitches have to be fat with one thin bitch.  Right.  You can't have a Western.  You can't have, you have to have like, everybody has to have that flat, stupid hair and the  girls have the, the, you know, just some fat fucked up titties.  Yeah.  Fat ass.  This, this chick was a stripper, but in the 1800s.  The 1800s.  She wouldn't have been attractive then.  Black death.  Fucking terrible. 
[00:09:00]  What's black death.  It's just fucking terrible.  It's a, it's another, uh, like a fucking crusade piece, you know, but the girl's a  witch or, but she's, she winds up not being, I don't know.  It's just fucking stupid.  I knew I had to give up Netflix when I was going through movies and they had like the  butterfly effect three was one of the new releases.  Right.  And I was like, man, that sounds shitty, but you know what shitty movie I'd like to watch  the butterfly effect one.  So I searched it and they don't have it.  Just butterfly effect three.  They don't have two.  They don't have one. 
[00:09:30]  Just the third one.  I watched the limelight.  What's the limelight documentary on the guy who opened the club.  Limelight.  Ugh.  Boo.  Why would they make it?  Oh, it just stinks.  And the, uh, the edge, the decade of decadence.  Those are just matches.  Thumbs down.  You didn't like it.  Three of them.  There's three of them.  There's three discs, but it's all matches.  Thumbs down.  Yeah.  You thought you were going to get like a documentary.  I want to know why you quit.  I want to know what happened.  I want to know why you fucked the dude's chick.  They actually are just, they're putting out a new edge DVD. 
[00:10:00]  That's the.  It'll probably be on Netflix.  What's his name?  He took his girl.  Matt Hardy's chick.  Yeah.  His is good.  Yeah.  That's a fucking good one.  Yeah.  And then, um, I watched, uh, Case 39.  I don't know.  What was Case 39?  I don't know.  Is that the scene work for your NYC 22?  No, no, no.  You're like, oh yeah.  No, I didn't.  Gotta get into the police mentality.  I did no scene work for that show.  Uh, Insidious.  Actually, DeRosa.  Good movie.  That was an actual movie.  DeRosa turned me on to that.  That was an actual movie.  Fucking great scary movie.  Yeah? 
[00:10:30]  Ending a little weird, but if you want a really good scary movie that's free on Netflix.  What am I doing right here?  What do you see me doing?  I'm taking notes.  Writing down the title.  As you should.  Insidious.  Good fucking movie.  Day ghosts.  Day ghosts.  Scary.  Oh, is that the movie you were talking about on the air where you were like-  On the air.  Somebody was talking about a movie on this show.  Yeah.  That, like, it had day scares in it.  I don't know, but day ghosts are the worst.  Because then it's like, even when it's daytime, you're still scared.  What the fuck, man?  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Ghosts on- there's a witching hour.  Right.  Okay?  If you watch the Ghost Hunters or any of those shows, from fucking- from 11-  Oh, by the way-  To 3.30 in the morning is when the ghosts come out.  I have never found a ghost on any of those shows.  That's not true.  I've never seen him find a ghost.  Full-body apparition on the Ghost Adventures.  What did the apparition do?  He walked.  So, it was a shadow.  No, it was weird.  It was a full-body apparition.  He was at the- actually, I was there two weeks ago at the Woshee- the Woshee Club or 
[00:11:30]  something like that.  I'm a member.  I forget the name of it.  It's the Millionaire Club in Virginia City.  Oh, why are you a member of that?  Uh, it's 20 bucks.  Oh.  Yeah, I'll join.  Any- I'll become a member of anything for $20.  The fucking Chicken Head Club.  Just so you can have a card and say I'm in.  Yeah, Fat Pussy Lip Club.  I'm in.  20 bucks.  Yeah.  I'll pay my dues.  I love Sunflower Seeds Club.  I'm in.  How much?  20 bucks?  I'm in.  You got me.  I'm in.  Um, we give the Thumbs Up Club.  Just guys that go around giving thumbs up to people to make them feel better. 
[00:12:00]  Thumbs up.  I'm in.  So, there was a full- he wishes he was in.  He doesn't have the 20.  Ah.  There was a full body apparition?  Full body- they went to the- this- in Virginia City they spent the night.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, I actually caught a ghost.  Uh, I caught a ghost.  You caught one?  I did.  What did you do with it?  I got an EVP of a ghost.  Where?  It's on my phone.  Let me see it.  I can't see it.  It's an EVP.  It's a-  Oh, it's the voice.  It's the voice.  And, ah! 
[00:12:30]  Was it the pipes?  No.  There's no pipes.  How do you know it was a ghost?  I-  Lookit.  It was- it was nobody in the room.  Uh-huh.  And, all of a sudden, when we played it back, and I didn't even hear it while we were doing  it.  When we played it back, we heard, ah!  You were with Ghost Hunters?  Uh, no.  It was with me, the manager of the comedy club, and some lady and her daughter.  So, what if it was just something on the recording?  Like, if you didn't hear it.  What?  What?  Like, anything.  It could just be a glitch.  Well, we were in a back room called The Crypt, where they used to keep all the dead bodies. 
[00:13:00]  And you know, if ghosts are gonna hang out somewhere-  It's The Crypt.  It's The Crypt.  And they- they used to put the dead bodies in there because of the winter.  The ground was too hard to bury them, so they'd leave them all winter long until the  summer, in this thing in the back of the hotel, The Crypt.  Sure.  And all the miners and shit.  And we were in there, and that's where-  What did you record it with?  My iPhone.  Okay.  The ghost recording app.  On your iPhone.  No, there's no ghost recording app.  You just used a little voice recorder on your iPhone.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  And it picked up- what did it sound like?  What?  Is he upset?  Do you wanna hear it?  Yeah.  I have it right here.  Yeah, I do.  I don't know if you can hear it.  Well, if you can't hear it on the recording, I don't think it's really worth much.  Well, I think you can hear it.  Ready?  I hope so.  I don't know.  Ready?  Ready?  Did you ask a question?  Are you asking a question?  Ready?  Go ahead, you ask.  Okay.  Is there anybody here with us?  If you are, can you tell us your name?  Right here. 
[00:14:00]  Did you hear it?  I heard a noise.  Did you hear it?  I did hear a noise.  Is the fire alarm going off right now?  I'm gonna give you the setup.  It's a fire drill.  Oh, okay.  I'm gonna give you the setup to that, okay?  Just know that it was me, it was me, the manager of the club, that woman, and her daughter.  That's it.  You know what happens here, Bob?  I know we're talking about ghost stories right now, but what happens is there was a fire  drill, but they don't make you go out to the fire drill if you're on the air.  Really?  So when there's a fire drill, everybody runs in on the after show, and that's when I become 
[00:14:30]  the most popular kid in the world.  Yeah, what's going on?  Everybody wants to be a part of the fun.  What's up, Troy?  What's up, buddy?  I caught a ghost on my recording.  I was listening.  What did you think?  There was no way.  Hang on, ready?  Here we go.  Now, I'm in the crypt.  Oh, Danny's shutting the curtains down.  I'm alone.  I'm alone.  It's getting very scary in here.  Okay, wait, wait, wait.  Intern, turn off the lights.  Turn off the...  Well, we'll still have these spotlights on, but still, turn the lights off.  Nah, I'm alone.  Oh, yeah!  Me, the manager of the club, a woman and her daughter, a young daughter, and that's it. 
[00:15:00]  And there's an older couple in the other room.  That's it.  Oh, no.  There's nothing, all right?  Ready?  Here we go.  Can you...  If you are, can you tell us your name?  Can you tell us why you're here?  Did you hear it?  It sounded like a baby in the other room.  Yeah, it sounded like a baby in the other room.  Yeah.  Okay, that'd be fine if there was a baby in the other fucking room. 
[00:15:30]  Was there anybody else in the house?  There was an older couple in the other room, but here's the deal.  They didn't scream.  They didn't make a noise.  They didn't make a noise.  I know, but you know what happened is?  What?  The floorboards creaked.  That's a...  That...  You're saying...  Hang on.  You're saying...  That could've been an old lady holding in a sneeze.  I'm gonna actually record.  Ready?  Okay.  I'm gonna actually record.  You ask a question, right?  You ask.  Okay.  Is there anybody here with us?  If you are, can you tell us your name? 
[00:16:00]  He said Paul.  No, he didn't say Paul.  I wish...  He went Paul.  I wish Paul was a ghost.  He went...  He went Paul!  Well, he is sort of a ghost.  I wish he was.  Um...  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I don't think that's a ghost.  He said Paul.  No, I think the floorboards might have said Paul.  There's no floorboards.  What was...  There's the wind.  There's no wind.  We're in the crypt.  There's no windows.  It's...  It's dirt floor.  It wasn't coming from the room. 
[00:16:30]  It was far away.  Yeah, but it...  There was nobody else...  And we didn't hear it when we recorded.  We didn't hear any of that shit.  Because it was so quiet.  Because it was from another room.  I wouldn't hear...  You didn't hear that until you played it back.  Until we played it back.  We did not hear it until we played it back.  We didn't know that the iPhone is specifically good at picking up noises.  When you make a voice recording into that iPhone, you're like, holy shit.  It picked up on the noise and didn't record all that background shit.  Yeah, but what?  So it heard...  What?  A little noise.  The ghost.  Not a ghost. 
[00:17:00]  Paul!  No.  She went, what's your name?  He went, Paul!  Paul!  Yeah.  Paul is my name!  Why didn't it come over to you then?  There was enough energy.  And that way you could walk over and be like, Paul.  Dude, I don't know.  I'm just saying.  I picked that up.  Okay?  We didn't hear it while we were recording.  If somebody screamed like a muffled scream, we would have heard it.  I know.  That's why you know it wasn't a muffled scream.  It was a floorboard creaking or some wind blowing in another room.  That was not a floorboard creaking.  There was no floorboards creaking.  You did not have a ghost encounter. 
[00:17:30]  And that's what I'm saying.  All these ghost shows that have...  You know what I hope?  I hope the ghost, I hope it attacks you.  Why would you say that?  I hope it...  No, this is what I hope.  I'm actually willing, I'm wishing, I'm praying that the ghosts come to your house tonight  and attack you.  I don't think if you believe in that.  Why would you wish that kind of negative energy?  Because I want you to believe.  I want you to be humble, Sam.  Or a ghost rape.  I want you to know.  I'd love for you to get raped.  I want you to know.  You know what negativity...  Like Bob or Hershey?  You know what negativity breeds?  It breeds more negativity.  Really?  All that negative energy you're sending to me, it's only going to be thrown back to you. 
[00:18:00]  You don't want that dude.  You don't want it.  It's not going to be to me.  It's going to be to you because you don't believe.  If you watch any horror movie, any possession movie, the guy who doesn't believe, and when  the person who does believe throws that at him, it comes to you.  Yeah, but guess what?  Now it's going to come to you.  Guess what?  You die so that the people who kind of believe start to believe.  I'll die.  That's fine.  I'll die.  But I want you to be haunted.  I want you to be possessed.  I want you to...  I actually...  I want you to have shit move. 
[00:18:30]  I want you to be attacked.  I want a full fucking demon to possess you.  That's horrible.  You mean not like a ghost?  Like paranormal activity?  Actually, I don't want it to possess you.  I want it to possess somebody in your family.  Like who?  Your mom.  Why would you say that?  She's such a...  Oh, she's nice too.  Oh, your dog.  I don't have a dog.  I have a cat.  You can't.  I hope your cat gets possessed.  That's fucked up.  He's a brother.  Oh, your brother.  Fucking great.  I hope you were over there.  His eyes are rolled back in his head and he's spider crawling upside down on the ceiling.  That'd be horrible.  That'd be great. 
[00:19:00]  But I don't think that would ever happen because that's a fictional movie you're describing.  But I hope your brother lives, but you die.  Why?  Out of fear.  Just have a heart attack and die of fear.  Just so other people won't be so fucking naive.  I'm naive.  You need to die so other people can learn.  You think that sound was definitely a ghost named Paul?  What do you think, Troy?  I don't know.  You think it was a ghost named Paul?  No.  I mean, look.  It's one of those things I think if you try to tap into it.  I think if you try to go...  It's like a Ouija board.  Like if you believe in the Ouija board, you'll make it move and it'll say crazy shit.  But if you don't believe in it, it won't.  You know, I think if you try to tap into that... 
[00:19:30]  I don't want to do that.  You believe...  Thank you.  I got one.  I got two.  What about you?  No, no, no.  Troy did not agree with you.  Troy did believe.  He just said if you believe in my...  No, I think if you...  He's trying not to get possessed.  If you try to seek more of it and search that out...  He is.  He's looking for a loophole so he doesn't get possessed.  He's trying to be...  He's neutral ghost.  Yes, he is.  I've heard things.  I've been in situations where I've heard things and I've just ignored them and said they're  not real.  First of all, in the horror movie, Troy's the first one to die. 
[00:20:00]  Absolutely.  Because he's the best looking one in the room.  Yes.  You're the one to get chopped in half.  You're the one to actually get some pussy, almost.  So who's the hero?  Who's the hero?  Is it Sex Bagel?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry to say, no, you're not the hero.  You're like the goofy guy.  It's going to come down to Sam.  First of all, I'm going to save...  My sacrifice is going to save you two.  Me and Travis.  Okay?  You're going to wind up disappearing.  Like some fucked up things happen.  You disappear.  We never know what happened to you. 
[00:20:30]  Until the end of the movie.  And you can tell too, because Roland's character is not fully developed.  He's just this weird, goofy dude.  Right.  He just disappears like, oh shit, we thought he got attacked, but we don't know.  And it comes down to you two.  But I save both of you, but one of you becomes possessed and evil and attacks the other.  I think it'll be Travis.  I think it'll be Travis.  And then you survive right at the end.  But I have to die to...  I fight the demon.  Because in the end, I'll be like, oh my God, Bob was right the whole time.  And I'll look and I'll be like, wasn't he Travis?  And then Travis has the eyes rolling back and I'll go, no! 
[00:21:00]  And then you kill him.  And then you live.  And as you're walking out, we see that Roland was hiding.  Yeah.  Okay.  He hears you, flips out, thinks it's the demon, and chops your fucking head off.  Wow!  Because he doesn't know.  That's a terrible ending.  What a downer.  But Roland lives.  He walks out and he's like, oh shit.  He's a stupid head.  Yeah, but then the guy that we didn't care about through the whole movie, because he was  hiding the entire time.  He's the one who lives.  He's the one who lives.  You're terrible at writing these.  I'm T.J. Miller.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  There you go.  T.J. Miller.  You have to die.  He's what's his face in summer school.  I'd watch that movie.  I'd watch that movie.  I'd watch it.  Eric, do you believe in the ghosts?  Yeah, I believe in something.  I don't think like physical ghosts, but I believe there's shit that's around you.  Like what?  Burgers.  Who said that?  Danny.  Danny was a fucking asshole.  All right.  We'll listen.  Danny, do you believe in ghosts?  If they made fucking tour posters.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know. 
[00:22:00]  I don't believe in ghosts until it's really late and I'm scared somewhere at night, then  there's definitely ghosts.  But right now when I'm in a room with a bunch of men, there's lights on.  There's no ghosts.  That's what kind of bugs me is that the ghosts are always old white people from a certain  18th century.  You never see like a disco ghost.  Right.  Like with roller skates and a headband.  It's not like somebody who just like died six years ago of a coke overdose.  Ghost.  I don't see any ghosts wearing hammer pants.  Right.  It doesn't happen.  Yeah, you never see those ghosts. 
[00:22:30]  Black ghosts?  There's never really any black ghosts.  Yeah, there's no like caveman ghosts.  Explain that, Troy.  It's just, I think it's just energy.  When you die, your energy goes somewhere.  Oh.  So if you try to tap into that energy.  Yeah, but you don't think black people have black energy?  Yeah, but I don't think there's a color.  Because why else would they walk like that?  There's no color.  I mean, they make it out like that in the movies, but it's just energy.  Yeah, but Bob is saying that on Ghost Hunters, they saw a ghost.  What color was the ghost?  Was it a white guy or a black guy? 
[00:23:00]  It was, they don't know.  It was an apparition.  Exactly.  All right, so here's the deal.  They have one of those cameras set up in a room, a stationary camera all night.  Yeah.  And it films everything for like six hours.  And it's night vision.  So the guy comes in the room, you see him walking, and then he walks out.  And then behind him, a guy walks behind him, but clear.  Like, and there's only three people in the house.  A guy walks behind him?  It's like a person.  I would say person, human being, or some figure shaped like a human walks behind him 
[00:23:30]  through the camera, past the window, where he just walked.  And the light doesn't get, you know, you can see an actual person walk through it.  I would quit ghost hunting forever.  You've never watched Ghost Hunters?  I watch all the time.  They never catch anything.  No, no.  They never find any ghost.  Well, we thought we might get something this time.  But we didn't.  We got some weird sound.  They get that stupid sound like you have on your phone.  Ghost Hunters actually, you had on video, you can see it.  The guy's walking and something pulls his shirt.  You can see his shirt actually get tugged.  Yeah, but do you think it was like a loose nail? 
[00:24:00]  A nail?  Like a loose nail.  No, I actually think it was like a shoelace he had in the front that he pulled and it  actually...  You don't think they doctor any of that up when it comes in because they make it look  a little more realistic?  Of course they do.  They went to...  Like the ghost adventurer guys are just...  If you look at all the other ghost shows, okay, here's the deal, is that they have  a crew.  They have a camera guy, a sound guy, probably three camera guys, two sound guys, a producer  following them.  Right.  The thing that I like about the ghost adventure guys is it's only three guys. 
[00:24:30]  So there's no camera crew?  They're the survivor man of this shit, not the Bear Grylls.  Yeah, they don't fuck around.  There's nobody else but three dudes.  Right.  They stay in all night.  They get locked in.  They don't get to get out.  And that's why they end up with tapes of somebody's stomach growling.  And they provoke.  Like the guy, Zach, is this muscle jacked up dude.  Who cares?  He's a ghost.  Yeah, but most people, they go like this. 
[00:25:00]  They go, we don't provoke.  This guy's like, attack me!  Attack me!  Did you see the one where he's in the kitchen?  Throw me the plate!  Yeah.  Yeah, he's like an axe.  He's like, attack me with the axe!  He's at Lizzy Borzen's house.  Yeah.  Chop my head off!  Which I think is just amusing.  I don't think they're real.  He got scratched by a demon.  It was a nail.  Was it a loose nail?  Yeah.  No, it was the trinity.  There's three scratches.  The trinity?  The demon.  The demon's scratch.  There's a demon trinity?  Yeah, the scratch is three scratches. 
[00:25:30]  I want to go ghost hunting with you.  I set it up at this Wosu club in Virginia City.  Are you a member?  I talked to the lady.  Suzy, I'm a member.  $20.  Okay.  And you can join too on the website.  I would join up if we could go ghost hunting.  Dude, we get to go, but if you're a member, you get to use the pool table.  Oh.  And does it price off on the drinks?  Oh, I agree.  You get money off on drinks.  Sounds like the $20 pays for itself.  And you get to just, yeah, it pays for itself after time.  After, of course.  Not the first time you go there.  No, no, no.  After time.  I'll do ghost hunting with Bob in a second. 
[00:26:00]  Okay.  I set it up.  This lady.  We should go ghost hunting in Cleveland.  Yeah.  What?  We're going to Cleveland at the end of the month.  We don't have any bits.  Oh.  Yeah.  Just go to the town.  Go to downtown.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking ghost town that is.  Actually, the first mall I stayed in the hotel there, it's the first indoor mall in  America was in Cleveland.  Really?  Absolutely.  And it's a fucking weird hotel.  There's ghosts in that hotel.  Why don't you come with us and we'll find them. 
[00:26:30]  And we'll get them on your iPhone and they'll be like, I'm Paul.  No, it's Paul.  Paul?  If you hear it.  But there's a place, but we can go to the Wosho Club.  I actually talked to Liddy Sue.  She said we can come back, stay the night.  Ooh.  We can stay the night in the crypt and upstairs.  So you become a member.  They're using the money for the memberships to finish the upstairs.  Oh, it's not done.  It used to be a millionaire club.  Only millionaires could belong to it.  And it was whores upstairs and the bar downstairs. 
[00:27:00]  Well, you still have to be a millionaire.  I mean, who else is going to come up with a 20?  Well, a millionaire in 1850 was 20 bucks.  They should have upped with inflation.  No, don't do that, dude.  No, 20 bucks, man.  20 bucks, man.  Yeah, this place is fucking haunted, man.  I'll go with you.  It's fucking haunted.  So everything Bob's saying is true.  That's true.  $200.  You got to be a member for $20.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  $200?  $200, your group gets access to the crypt.  Yeah, $200 to stay at night.  But they said, because I talked to the lady, we can do it for nothing. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we got, we got con blanc.  Ooh.  Wow.  So we can go for nothing.  I'll go.  I want to keep it.  You want to go?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, I'm getting a four man team together.  I'm on.  Remember when we did paintball?  We need a skeptic.  I'm the skeptic.  You're the skeptic.  Fuck you, Paul.  Fuck you, Paul.  Do you know how happy it would make me if we really did this?  And he really got possessed by a demon.  Like, it was just an awful night of just ghost, crazy demon shit.  You know why that would never happen? 
[00:28:00]  Because they don't exist.  Skeptic, oh shit.  I'll go to get drunk.  You can now.  See, we don't do that at the worship club.  Should we buy their t-shirts before going?  Of course.  Everybody's got to wear their worship club t-shirts.  I'm telling.  They have t-shirts.  Do I get a discount on that because I'm a member?  I think so.  Can you hook me up with a discount?  No, you've got to become a member.  I'll become a member.  It's $20.  God damn it.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  It's the best $20 you're ever going to spend.  When you walk into the Wosho club, when you go there in Virginia City, you get discounts  on drinks. 
[00:28:30]  And access to the pool table.  Bob.  There's a room.  It's a Wosho, the millionaire member club.  You can't go into the pool table without it.  Yeah, but you've got to pay the $20 to be in the millionaire club.  You have to pay the $20.  Okay.  What about this thing that $1,000 will get us?  Well, come on.  $1,000 will get you a sucker button?  A $1,000 donation will entitle your group to a full overnight investigation in one of  the West's most haunted venues.  A shirt that says asshole is what you want to ask.  Your group name is also included on a plaque on display in the museum.  We can make our own plaque for another $30,000.  Easy. 
[00:29:00]  We don't need to pay the $1,000.  Look, here's the deal.  Did you say we can make our own plaque?  For like $30,000?  Yeah.  But I don't think you can hang it on the wall.  Yeah, we could.  Well, on this wall, but not the Wosho club wall.  Oh, what's that wall?  Well, I told you.  I got the hookup.  I got the hookup.  We'll be good.  Who else is going to join the four-man team?  Who else is in?  I'm so there.  You're right.  So we got Trav.  Who else?  I think we can make it a five-man team if other people...  I'll go.  All right.  Yell at the ghosts.  You think Opie has said he wants to go ghost hunting?  Yeah, we'll bring Opie.  Of course.  We need somebody with some fucking credibility and fame. 
[00:29:30]  You're right.  To make sure it's free.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah.  We need an actual millionaire in the Millionaire's Club.  We need an actual millionaire.  What about you, Troy?  I hate that shit.  You don't want to fuck up your hair?  You're not going to go?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what ghosts would do to Troy.  He'd mess his hair up.  Mess it up.  There's no place to plug in my blow dryer.  Fuck that, dude.  I hate that shit.  I hate trying to...  I don't watch horror movies.  No.  Fuck that.  I've been scared.  Why?  I don't know, man.  I just don't like it.  Really?  Life's scary enough as it is.  And he just got his nose done. 
[00:30:00]  He doesn't want them messing it up.  Oh, you got your nose done?  Yeah, I got my septum fixed.  Well, and...  And some cosmetic surgery.  My nose is crooked.  Why'd you get cosmetic surgery?  No, it's not cosmetic.  He's very big.  He's very big.  You're a beautiful man.  Why would you have to go follow him?  Sam embellishes on the air all of the time.  For everything.  Sam embellishes?  Yes.  That's bullshit.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, come on.  Now, on the shit show that Sam embellishes?  Completely embellishes.  And then tells Opie and Anthony when I'm out that I went in for fucking nose surgery. 
[00:30:30]  You went to get a cosmetic surgery.  Went in for cosmetic surgery.  I'm recovering for surgery the next morning and my Twitter's blowing up that they're fucking  destroying me on the air because of getting cosmetic surgery.  Well, you did.  No, I didn't.  Why'd you get cosmetic surgery though?  No, I didn't get cosmetic surgery.  I broke my nose really bad in a fight and it was crooked.  Whoa.  Was it a fight over pussy?  No, no, no.  What was the fight over?  It was a fight over who gets his second first dick.  Who was sexier?  No.  Who had the better hair?  I have the better hair.  No, you don't.  They started fighting each other and the agreement was no hits to the face.  No hits to the face. 
[00:31:00]  He fought with a poster of Elvis over who had the better hair.  No, I got into a fight with a guy I used to be in a band with and he broke my nose  really bad.  You know what Katie Lang wants to look like.  So it was not cosmetic.  It was.  I mean, cosmetically to fix, my nose was crooked on my face.  I have a crooked nose too.  Get it fixed.  But you also, you shaved a bump down.  I broke it up.  You got the crookedness fixed.  Yeah.  That's very cosmetic.  No, it was a bump because of the break.  Why did you get your eyelashes fixed then?  Exactly.  Why'd you get them shaped?  Because my eyelashes are fine. 
[00:31:30]  Why did you get every...  Do you notice a difference?  Yeah.  No, you don't.  Aesthetically or personally?  Both.  Aesthetically, I do.  Personally, you're still the same bro.  But aesthetically, I do.  No, you could compare the pictures of both the old and new nose.  He doesn't look like he's the same guy.  No, he looks different.  No, fuck off.  Because my nose is now on the right spot of my face.  Well, it looks different.  I don't know where it was.  Exactly.  You looked great before, but now it's a whole new thing.  Yeah.  It's alright, dude.  So it wasn't cosmetic.  I mean, a little cosmetic to fix it.  Yeah, okay. 
[00:32:00]  Now we're starting to...  You just admitted it.  No, but I can breathe better now.  Okay.  That's good, dude.  Look, man.  You want to be as good looking as you possibly can be.  It's all good, dude.  These fucking assholes don't realize that.  Look good to feel good.  Huh?  Look good to feel good, right?  That's right.  Even if you have to get cosmetic surgery.  No, it wasn't.  It was more so to breathe.  Well...  Now I can breathe.  I hope you breathe in a ghost.  No.  Me?  No.  I hope you get possessed.  I hope you get a full demon possession.  I'm not going to.  I hope whatever ghosts are in your house watching you that are not open to you right 
[00:32:30]  now, I tell them to open up to you right now.  You know what?  I'm using my psychic ability, I'm using to tell them to attack you.  You know what my psychic ability is doing right now?  Telling them to go fuck themselves.  See?  Yeah, that's why they're mad.  Now they're coming out.  Tonight, watch what happens tonight, Sam.  Oh, shit.  Nothing's going to happen.  You're going to be alone tonight, and you're going to be there, and all of a sudden you're  going to hear a noise, and that's the first ghost.  There's going to be four ghosts that visit you tonight.  Yeah, four.  There was three. 
[00:33:00]  No, that's the other show.  Don't believe in it.  It won't happen.  Okay.  No, that doesn't work.  No, it won't.  Because you're going to say, I don't believe in it.  This isn't real.  This isn't real.  Right, but you're going to know that you believe in it.  Like when my bed starts bouncing around.  The devil is coming for you.  The devil?  No, he's not.  You think he's got bigger fish to fry at this point.  No, he doesn't.  The devil has that much free time.  Yeah, he's like God.  He can do a lot of things.  Omnipotent.  He can multidesk.  Multidesk. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like the same thing.  A demon is coming for you tonight.  And what's the name of the demon?  Paul?  His name, he doesn't have a name.  He's coming.  There's something coming for you tonight.  You'll hear it.  You'll hear it.  Imagine this really happens.  I'd love it.  All that's going to happen is I'm going to hear the same thing I do every night.  The cat yelling from outside the door.  That's not the cat tonight.  No?  It's a demon.  Is it going to sound like a cat though?  I told you, your cat will be possessed. 
[00:34:00]  How do you know it's not a cat at the Washu Club?  Right.  It could be a cat.  Exactly.  I hope you get a time.  Because it's not as cool to think it's a cat.  Is that what it is?  It's cooler to be like, oh, there was a ghost.  But it was probably a cat.  It was probably a cat.  The cat that said Paul?  It didn't say Paul.  It said meow.  It sounded like a cat saying Paul.  Paul.  It said...  Paul?  No, it said...  There was no cats.  Meow.  That's what it said.  That was the noise.  Meow.  How much time do you get left on this show?  Well, we actually...  Turn on the lights.  It's weird in here. 
[00:34:30]  Who's getting scared?  No, we're done talking about ghosts.  You're getting scared.  You're getting scared.  Because it's coming.  That's better.  Sam, look at me.  Yeah, okay.  It's coming.  No, it's not.  You can look at me like that all you want.  You have no power.  He's looking at me, not blinking, like he's summoning some power deep into my soul.  Uh-oh.  Now his eyes are rolling back a little bit.  You do look demonic like that.  It's because he's coming.  You do look demonic.  So what else do you watch?  I don't like...  Danny's got good ones, but he's saying them off mic. 
[00:35:00]  What the fuck?  Is this your first time on radio, asshole?  We're all just friends.  We're all friends.  Dude, I wanted to talk to you about the Von Eriks.  Yeah, what else do you watch?  First of all, I love that Brock's back, but I think that this cocksucker needs to learn  that he's not in the UFC and stop punching people for real.  He did on Raw.  Brock Lesnar.  You saw him?  He punched John Cena in the mouth.  You literally saw him remember, oh shit, not UFC.  And then he punched the canvas.  Yeah, he's like, okay, no body shots only.  Because he punched him directly in the mouth.  His teeth were bloody. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, he was trying to fucking win the UFC championship.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He really socked Cena in the mouth.  And Cena's not used to that.  No, but he loved it.  He did.  Yeah, it reminded him of his own fucking Boston days.  He was like, yeah, let's do this shit.  No, we're over at fucking Punky Hill Community College.  I got fucking sucker punched.  He doesn't have to play up to little kids right now.  He's getting punched in the face.  But I saw that you.  Well, also, you know, while you're talking about what's going on right now.  Yeah.  You know, everybody who watches wrestling and listens to this show.  Yeah.  Is flipping out over this Lord Tenzai Bob Kelly connection. 
[00:36:00]  It's it.  I saw the tweets.  Yeah.  Would you get some Japanese characters put on your face just for the photo op?  Well, I could just go and get his fake ones.  Oh, yeah.  They have to be fake, right?  Yeah, definitely.  But how do they not come off?  How do they not sweat off?  I don't know.  I don't know what they use, but they're not real.  Yeah.  But he.  I can't.  I can't deny it.  He looks like you, dude.  I exactly like me.  You could get all tattered up, though.  Yeah.  He looks exactly like me.  I can't fucking deny it.  I would love to fight it.  It's just me. 
[00:36:30]  Travis, is this the first time you're seeing him?  That's the second one is the best one.  What is it?  Troy.  It's fucking me.  It really is me.  It's uncanny.  And you do have a wide enough jaw that you could fit three chin piercings in below your  bottom lip there.  Just like him.  Are you summoning more spirits right now?  No, I'm just waiting.  I'm not.  I'm going to help you with your slam.  Would I have to laugh at your fucking mean things?  No, but you could talk to me a little bit.  Oh, I was trying. 
[00:37:00]  I was just.  I was waiting for the laugh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really does.  I mean, you can't.  You can't fuck with it.  He looks exactly like me.  Is that how you would wrestle, too?  That's a face you make.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I would use.  I was.  He's using the claw, which he's bringing it back, which is from the Von Erics.  That's right.  That's right, Bobby.  He did not to.  Wow.  Look at him.  He's actually fake ninja stuff in the ring like he would do.  Yeah.  He's doing fake ninja shit.  But that's like I told you I was watching that.  What's it called?  What was the show I was watching? 
[00:37:30]  The world class.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  So, yeah.  You were watching the WWE documentary on world class.  My God.  The Von Erics.  That's a Netflix.  You must see.  Yeah, it's the most.  It's so sad, but so interesting because you remember all the wrestling you forgot.  Yeah.  As a kid, all the guys.  I think because, you know, you think it's just the WWF or WWE your whole life.  You forget that there was other, this whole, the Von Erics, the Kevin and. 
[00:38:00]  In the 80s.  Carrie and.  The Von Erics ruled it.  There was.  God.  Kevin Von Erics, Carrie Von Erics, Fritz Von Erics was their dad.  And Carrie, his body, like he was like the next generation physically.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, Carrie Von Erics was the one who made it to WWF.  He was fucking like physically.  Oh, my God.  But people don't realize like they just think they think about, you know, the old Von Erics  stuff and whatever.  They don't realize that this family.  Oh, my God.  If anybody is haunted by demons, this is the family. 
[00:38:30]  I mean, the brother died.  The oldest brother died.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  We'll take that.  And this was like this was this wrestling family was like the biggest shit in Texas.  The biggest.  And beyond Texas.  Way beyond Texas.  I used to watch him.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You'd watch the fucking Von Erics, the tornado.  What was his?  What was his tornado?  Texas tornado and the rose.  And it was brilliant.  They had the largest selling venue at the time.  They sold that.  The stadium.  The stadium. 
[00:39:00]  The baseball stadium out.  Huge.  And but I never knew what happened to him.  Yeah.  I knew that some people died.  Some of them died.  I watched this documentary on Netflix.  I mean, what a fucking because the whole documentary, you don't even see it coming  because the whole documentary is like the lead up.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  They're the biggest thing in wrestling.  They're all family together and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Then all of a sudden.  One dies.  One dies.  And then all of a sudden.  Another dies.  Commit suicide.  Yeah.  One almost dies. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Almost dies.  And then he goes back and says, fuck it.  Takes himself out.  Yeah.  He almost dies.  And then he survives that to commit suicide.  Leaves a note.  And then another one that wanted to be a wrestler couldn't.  Because he had some weird bone brittle disease.  Yeah.  He fucking knocks himself out.  Right.  And then the one guy.  Wait, no.  Then the fucking Kerry gets into a motorcycle accident.  The main guy.  The star of the family.  He was the young one that was going to be the national star. 
[00:40:00]  The national star.  I mean, looked great.  Yeah.  Was un-fucking-believable.  Beautiful hair.  Yeah.  Gets into a motorcycle accident.  They compound fracture of his foot.  They fix it.  He stands up in the middle of the night and ruins all the nerve shit that they fixed.  They have to amputate his foot.  They fixed his foot.  An adonis.  He didn't even think about it.  He was probably high or something.  And he just stood up in the middle of the night.  Stood up.  And it crushed his foot. 
[00:40:30]  Fucked up all the surgery they did.  Had to cut his foot off.  And then he still triumphs.  Makes it to the WWF.  He wrestles in cowboy boots.  Right.  With a fake foot in it.  With a fake foot.  And then he takes himself out because he was going to jail.  And he doesn't just take himself out.  He goes to his father's ranch.  Goes to a tree.  The tree.  And he goes, hey, I'm going to sleep under the tree.  No.  Let me see that gun that I bought you a year ago.  I'm just going to go target practice for him. 
[00:41:00]  I'll be back in a minute.  Goes out to his tree.  Puts it to his heart.  And fucking blows himself away.  It's crazy.  And it's.  There's.  There was.  One guy left.  There was.  Six.  Von Eriks that were involved in wrestling.  There's one left.  One left.  Kerry.  No.  Kevin.  Why.  Would you.  I'd hide.  Just.  I would fucking hide.  Um.  Walt watched it.  What's up, Walt?  You're on after OB and Anthony live.  Yeah.  I was just going to. 
[00:41:30]  I'm just essentially echoing what Bobby said.  I watched that thing on Saturday night.  I.  I felt like crying out.  And I thought it would be a good, fun, old school wrestling show.  Yeah.  And I'm.  I'm watching this horrible tragedy.  Even though I knew everything that was going to happen.  It was just horrific hearing Kevin talk about it the whole time.  Yeah.  It just ripped your heart out.  It was terrible.  You're watching it because you're being like, yeah, the Von Eriks are the shit.  The Von Eriks are going to be the next big thing.  Even as you're watching it, you're like, yeah, it's all about the Von Eriks.  Yeah.  What can stop them now?  Yeah.  And the whole family is either drug induced or gun induced suicides. 
[00:42:00]  Fucking gone.  Three of them committed suicide.  Cool.  That's mental illness.  Yeah.  That's that's like.  But you don't see that degree of mental illness.  And like usually one person in the family gets it.  Not every single.  Not all of the brothers.  Okay.  I get.  Look at usually the goofy looking one gets it.  Right.  All right.  Like the one with the brittle bone disease thing.  I get it.  And the other one too.  The other one that got the operation and got sick in Japan.  Yeah.  The cockeyed one.  Yeah.  With the red hair.  Yeah.  I get it.  He goes to Japan. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  He goes to Japan.  Yeah.  And he's going to be the next big shit.  Yeah.  And then he gets sick.  He gets sick and he loses all his muscle.  Loses that.  And then he kills himself.  Fucking fuck.  Boom.  There's one left.  Your one guy left is Carrie.  It was so sad.  And to learn too that their teeth.  They had horse teeth.  Every single one of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's these fucking huge chicklets.  And they don't age well.  No.  Because those teeth just stay big.  Like when you're.  I think Kevin looks all right. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to be what 60.  I guess he looks all right based on the way the rest of his family is done.  Oh boy.  Jesus.  What a.  But that was a documentary.  And they went into detail.  And who was the other.  What was the.  What was the other team that they went against?  The Freebirds.  The Freebirds.  I forgot how awesome they were.  The Freebirds are all kicking.  One of them writes for Smackdown now.  They were fucking great.  Yeah.  The.  When he walked in with his little.  Vests and his bow tie.  His big Confederate flag.  Like everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And then they had the.  The.  Who's the crazy African.  Kamala.  Kamala.  What are you.  You want to hear.  You want to.  You want to get bummed out again.  What happened.  Do you know what's going on with Kamala right now.  Now what.  Kamala.  You know.  He wrestled.  He's a big fat African guy.  He wrestled.  Bare feet.  I mean originally.  At some point.  And bare feet.  You know.  We ruined it.  And.  Yeah.  He now.  First.  He got diabetes.  He had to get one of his right foot taken off. 
[00:44:00]  God.  Then.  He had to get the whole right leg taken off.  Jesus.  And just now.  His son went on some radio show.  Kamala Junior.  And said.  He's going to have to get the left foot taken off too.  Well.  I mean.  The waist down.  Yeah.  Wrestling is a sad fucking industry.  When you.  From.  Back then.  Back then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just sad to see.  Cause nobody.  There was no money to be made.  And anybody that made money didn't save any of it.  Yeah.  That's a sad thing. 
[00:44:30]  Like.  At least the wrestlers now.  Um.  Avenues for them to go down.  Yeah.  And.  The company will kind of bring them back.  And write.  Or whatever.  It's good to see super.  Uh.  What's his name.  Um.  Steamboat.  Yeah.  And.  Edge was in here.  Yeah.  He said he's never wrestling again.  But he said he doesn't miss any of it.  And he's got plenty of money.  He's just retiring in the mountains.  He just made a movie.  Yeah.  He made a.  That looks.  You know.  Another Netflix.  I'll watch it.  Yeah. 
[00:45:00]  Cause it's shit.  And he was like.  Well I don't want to sound like a douche.  But if it falls in my lap.  I'll take it.  Fuck yeah.  But I'm not going to go audition for nothing.  I'm not going to pound the pavement.  Yeah.  I don't need to.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Absolutely.  If I.  Look.  If I had that money.  I'd move to Cleveland.  Yeah.  Where you can buy a mansion for 150,000.  Well.  Be the king of Cleveland.  Bob.  You made.  You made it through the entire.  After opening.  Anthony live.  Show's over.  Oh my God.  All right.
