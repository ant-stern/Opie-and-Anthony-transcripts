<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts looking at old photos from their radio careers, noting the significant increase in photos taken since their days at WNEW compared to earlier stations. Opie's drastically different appearance, specifically his formerly jet-black goatee and hair, was a point of discussion.  This led to a shocking revelation:  Opie unearthed photos of them participating in a bizarre stunt at Faneuil Hall for Comedy Central â€“ they were human bowling balls, rolled down a ramp into oversized pins.  Neither host remembered the event, sparking amusement and discussion about its absurdity, the size of the rolling sphere, and the fact that the audience wasn't specifically there for them.

The conversation then veered into other outrageous stunts, including a particularly painful one involving being pelted with golf balls on a driving range while wearing hockey goalie gear and frying pans duct-taped to their crotches.  They recounted the pain and near-misses, highlighting the stunt's later imitation by other radio shows.  This prompted a reflection on the current state of radio, contrasting their own history of outlandish stunts with the modern focus on firings for inappropriate comments.

Briefly, the hosts mentioned posting pictures of themselves cleaning their ears on Twitter in response to Dice Clay.  They also showed photos from their early WAAF days, commenting on their youthful appearance and the surprisingly long lifespan of their broadcasting equipment. The segment concluded with Opie teasing a story about a disturbing TV show he had recently watched.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop job.  Opie and Anthony.  There's only like one picture of you and I in the WBAB studio.  Yeah.  There's only a few at the WAF studios.  And then there's tens of thousands in the WNEW studio.  Yeah, that's when we really kind of decided.  That's why it's kind of fun to find the older ones from like AAF, because those are like rare.  Yeah.  And you look exactly the same. 
[00:00:30]  Nah, I'm a little gray.  That's what it is.  A little grayer, bud.  The gray, the gray him.  Because I look and I see a lot of pictures of you with a goatee and it's just like jet black.  Yeah.  I got to get like Bobby Kelly and use the medicine.  He says, I use the medicine.  Yeah, you had a, you had a.  How can I explain this?  Your, the, the, your color black was black.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Does that make sense?  Yeah, it was like black, jet black.  It was like jet black, which you don't see often.  Because most people that have black hair technically have dark, dark brown hair.  Yeah.  You know that, right?  But with you, I think it was, I, I, officially black hair.  It was black hair.  Like jet black.  Like midnight black.  Black goatee.  I found a picture.  Like I'm going through this box of pictures last night.  I found a picture.  I have no recollection of us doing this.  Did, did you know that you and I were human bowling balls? 
[00:01:30]  Think about it.  Wait a minute.  I think about it.  I block these things out many times.  Like I'm looking at these pictures going, wow, what happened next?  We did the douchiest of douche, douche radio bits.  We were human bowling balls in Faneuil Hall.  Do you remember this? 
[00:02:00]  I have completely blocked this out.  Do you have a recollection?  Like when I, when I saw the pictures, I'm like, oh my God, then it all came to me.  But if someone would have talked to me only a mere 24 hours ago, I would have said, there's  no effing way that Anthony and I were human bowling balls.  Dude, I have absolutely no recollection of this.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  And you know, it was some kind of comedy central thing. 
[00:02:30]  Comedy central came to town.  I guess they needed shock jocks.  I don't know.  Were we hypnotized to do this?  Because first of all, I can't imagine we did it.  Well, although back then, uh, well, I just don't, I don't remember.  What did it entail?  It entailed.  It was a, uh, a huge, huge bowling ball.  It barely looked like a bowling ball.  It was a, it was a sphere. 
[00:03:00]  A big sphere.  That you sat in and you got harnessed into.  Nice.  There's no way we did this.  And then we were rolled down a ramp into bowling pins that were human size.  No way.  No way.  Yes.  I defy you to show me a picture of me strapped in this device.  Well, well, my friend, you just blew up my Twitter because later on today, because I, I, I didn't want to put it up last night.  I was like brain damaged. 
[00:03:30]  Dude, I, when I saw it, I couldn't believe it.  I, I got the, I got the chills of the douche variety.  I'm like, Oh, maybe I should just rip these pictures up.  No one will ever know.  I would have remembered that.  And it was a huge crowd.  And I, the crowd wasn't there for us.  There's no way.  Cause we just started in Boston.  Couldn't have been there.  Cause I'm looking at the crowd and they're obviously there for something else.  And we just happen to be there.  I mean, we'll be honest, you know, we, we've, we've drawn huge crowds over the years, but this one wasn't ours.  Wasn't ours.  No way.  Okay.  We were just like, you know, they might've had, they might've had TV cameras there or something. 
[00:04:00]  I am trying so hard.  I'm racking my dream.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  Cause I know you're not going to remember this.  Strapped.  We were like individually strapped in a sphere and then rolled down a ramp.  Yeah.  At Faneuil Hall into bowling pins.  Yeah.  And I got, and, and, and we were broadcasting.  Was it near the, the front, like where we usually stop a cab at Faneuil Hall to get out?  Was it like right there? 
[00:04:30]  It was right in the middle.  It was in the middle.  Okay.  See, so I got in the middle where, where they don't have, uh, you know, cars or, or any of  that.  Look, I, I, I swear to you, this is not ringing a bell whatsoever.  I think it was one of our first like months up there.  So we were just happy to be there.  So whatever this radio station said we would do, cause we had no love.  Oh yeah.  No, no.  I know that.  That's what happens at radio.  You know, every radio guy has to do crazy stuff until you get a little leverage and then 
[00:05:00]  you tell them to go F themselves.  And let me tell you something.  I genuinely was happy to be there.  And, and I like when they'd come up with those gags, I'd be like, all right.  Yeah.  This sounds great.  Cause you know, it's, I, I didn't have to get up and do construction.  So I was happy to do those things.  But I, I swear to you, I would have remembered something like that because I'd have been  like, I gotta like, you were definitely throw up or something.  The picture of you, it's not as obvious that it's you in there, but I could tell. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  We've been around a long time.  Well, cause I have other pictures where it's the same like shirt you have on.  Yeah.  You know, I can't really see your face in the picture I got, unfortunately.  Oh, the one, one of me though.  Oh boy.  It's you.  Oh yeah.  With a microphone.  I'm just ready to broadcast as I roll down this ramp.  I, I can't, I can't.  I'm trying so hard.  Was it, was it warm out or cold?  Was it winter, summer? 
[00:06:00]  I think it was like spring.  I think we were only there a month, maybe.  Maybe in there a month.  It was, so it was, it was after we got back from LA.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we, and then we, oh yeah.  Cause we got short sleeves on and stuff.  Bowling ball.  Boy, I cannot wait to see these pictures because.  You know, they're not the greatest, but I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll put them up.  I didn't need a blurry Bigfoot picture.  Just something to jog my memory.  What I should have done was just brought in the whole box today for you.  Yeah.  To check out.  I found some stuff yesterday. 
[00:06:30]  I'm like, what?  Wow.  Yeah.  I figured I'd bring that up today for you.  Human bowling ball.  You and I did human bowling ball.  That's the exact type of radio bit.  We would beat the crap out of anybody for doing.  You know what?  You got to bring, um, bring the whole box of pictures in and we'll get some, uh, you  know, some scrub.  That's what I call the interns scrubs.  Yeah.  Uh, to a scan them into my computer.  I'll bring my little scanner in.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  And just so I have, have those online.  Yeah.  Cause, uh, I, I guess I need to run through it and, and just go.  Ah, as all the memories come back and I, I curl in the fetal position with a nosebleed  cause brand new memories are coming into my head.  And the looks on our faces, it looks like we were really, uh, really into it too.  Like, all right, come on guys.  We were good at faking that.  No, I don't think we were faking because we had no leverage.  I know we had no leverage. 
[00:07:30]  We had to do what we had to do.  You got to do a little sacrificing.  Loved doing it.  Didn't we?  I remember the, the, the golf ball thing.  I can't find those pictures.  That's the ones I want to find.  Yeah.  We're still in the middle of a driving range with a hockey gear on and frying pans in front  of our groin area to duct tape there.  And, uh, we let people just tee off at us.  That wasn't a hack bit.  That was fun.  That bit, that bit was copied by so many radio shows after we did it. 
[00:08:00]  Cause it, cause it made one of the radio trade magazines, which is the kiss of death.  It was always the kiss of death for us.  Then everyone does it.  Well, there's a R and R and FMQB.  If you get your picture in there doing some amazing radio, something no one else has ever  done.  Great.  Next thing you know, a month or two later, it's completely blurred cause every other radio  show in America does the bit.  You notice that just doesn't happen anymore.  That's like a dead thing in radio.  Well, just doing like the, yeah, the crazy stuff that made the papers and things like 
[00:08:30]  that.  Now it's pretty much just this guy said something stupid and he's getting fired.  That's the only radio thing you've read about in recent years.  Right now it's, you know, that, that part of it is just dead.  Remember the golf ball stunt though?  Yeah.  That was scary.  I remember getting hit.  We were well padded, but when you get hit by a golf ball after someone hits it with a  driver.  Oh yeah.  And we were only a hundred and, uh, we were between a hundred and a hundred and twenty-five  yards out.  About a hundred and twenty-five yards out. 
[00:09:00]  Something like that.  Yeah.  It, uh, you felt it.  It was, I mean, what was even scarier was the golf balls that were just missing.  You're just whizzing by your head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those were creepy because you, when you got hit, you knew you had padding on cause you  felt the golf ball hit, but it didn't give you that pain.  Like you didn't have padding on when it whizzed by your head.  You got that feeling like when you were on the golf course and someone like teed off.  Oh yeah.  And, uh, and it whizzed by your ear and you realize, Oh, that could have cracked my skull 
[00:09:30]  open.  Yeah.  And when, and when you got hit, you wanted to just start screaming bloody murder and then  realize, Oh, all right.  You're, you're well protected.  But just the thud it makes and the clang that that one made when it hit right off my  frying pan.  Cause, uh, I was thinking I could wear a cup, but I'm thinking a cup isn't strong enough.  And if you get hit in the side of the thigh and the cup moves over, it's going to hurt  anyway.  So I just took a frying pan, a giant black frying pan and duct taped it, uh, right over  my groin area. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, one hit, it was a direct hit and you just heard like a bong.  It was like a, a Chinese gong sound, uh, where I would have just been, we both had, we both  had the frying pans.  I think you came up with that, which was a great idea.  We, we, we were dressed like hockey goalies for the most part, but yeah, I found, uh, I  found, I haven't found those pictures.  I'll, I'll find them though.  So these are boxes that I've had in my basement in Huntington for like off and on for 10 years 
[00:10:30]  before that, it was in a basement up in Boston.  Before that it was in my mom's house.  These boxes haven't been opened and it's like, it's like time capsules.  We're listeners pushing us down the ramp.  Oh, no, no.  How are we being propelled?  I, I, I think that like the Comedy Central people, I, I'm not sure if it was filmed or  it was, where it was another failed pilot attempt that we were part of.  How many of those have we done over the years?  Quite a few failed ones.  Yeah, no kidding.  Where they don't even acknowledge that we did anything for them. 
[00:11:00]  That's always, that's always a pleasure.  Thank you, Comedy Central.  I'm trying to remember this.  I don't, I would have remember being strapped into something like that.  Well, remind, someone remind me, I'll bring all these pictures in tomorrow.  Got to.  All right.  And also in honor of Dice, you know, with this Twitter thing.  Yeah.  Remember he was saying like status?  Yeah.  I'm cleaning my ears.  Yeah, I got a few of those last night.  So I did a cleaning my ears tweet last night.  It was, it was the biggest hit.  Pictures and everything? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I had, I happen to have a jar of Q-tips and I'm holding one.  So you see my hand holding one and then you see the jar of Q-tips and it says, I'm cleaning  my ears with Q-tips.  Why not?  It was a huge hit last night.  Yeah.  People, people love hearing what you're doing.  Doesn't matter how stupid it is.  There it is.  Cleaning my ears with Q-tips.  Oh, look, there are the Q-tips.  Wow.  And people could go, those are the Q-tips.  He's actually cleaning his ears right now.  Yeah.  I feel a little closer to Opie. 
[00:12:00]  That was in honor of what Dice was saying yesterday because everyone has to update their status.  Yes.  With their Facebooks.  Status.  And what's not.  So, all right.  Yeah.  Oh, show them the AAF picture.  Opie Radio on Twitter, by the way.  We're finally social networking our butts off here.  Look at that picture.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Look at the jet black hair.  Yes.  That's all it is. 
[00:12:30]  Your hair is darker in these pictures.  That's it.  I look like I'm 17 years old.  Yeah.  You look like a young child.  And I wasn't even that young at that point.  Danny.  Oh, yes, yes.  The coolest thing is that you're still using the same equipment that's in that photo.  Yeah.  You know what?  Look, that's the same board.  Oh, my God.  I think it's the exact same board.  Oh, how sad.  Is that the exact same board that we're using right here in New York? 
[00:13:00]  I don't think it's yours.  I think it's my board.  I think that's the one I'm using.  It's that one right there?  Yeah.  Wow, dude.  Because that picture is easily 12 years old.  Yeah.  We've bitched about the old equipment we're using here in New York where we got wood and stuff.  Our stuff is framed in wood here.  And there it is.  There it is.  A picture from years ago with all the wood.  Yeah.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  Seems like yesterday, doesn't it? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, boy.  Sure does.  Not much has gone on since then, huh?  Look at the innocence of us in that picture.  Oh, naive new recruits ready to be sent over to the NOM.  Now look at us.  We can barely look at each other or talk to each other.  What the hell happened?  Oh, my God.  You laugh because you know it's true.  877-212-ON-A.  You've got to talk about the show.  Oh, my God. 
[00:14:00]  I watched a TV show last night when I was going to bed.  That is just so wrong.  Right.  So wrong.  Lost?  No.  Lost I watched.  It was pretty good.  Yeah.  A lot of time traveled and stuff.  Yeah.  But, no, it was after Lost.  Yeah.  So DVR'd Lost.  And watched that.  And then I turned on this program.  And I guess they were playing three episodes in a row.  Yeah.  And I was watching just going, oh, my God.  This is the wrongest show I've ever seen.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  I thought the police were going to barge in on me.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  You'll explain next.  Of course I will.  It's a tease.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
