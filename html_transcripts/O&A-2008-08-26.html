<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the Democratic National Convention, focusing on Ted Kennedy's frail appearance, the convention's perceived lack of energy, and a reported plot against Barack Obama involving arrests near the convention.  The hosts also debated whether Obama was considered "black enough" by some in the black community, referencing opinions from Spike Lee and rappers.  Further political discussion touched on the upcoming Republican convention, Hillary Clinton, John McCain's campaign strategies (including using Democrat primary soundbites), and the hosts' distaste for Michelle Obama, particularly her facial expressions and her children's waving at a screen showing Barack Obama.  This political commentary was interspersed with a repeated showing of a video of a man, Pat Duffy, receiving a brutal kick to the groin, accompanied by discussion of technical difficulties playing different versions of the video.  The hosts also noted staff member Steve's decision to shave his graying facial hair and commented on John McCain's attempts to appeal to broader audiences through appearances with Daddy Yankee and Misty May, as well as Madonna's controversial comparison of John McCain to Adolf Hitler.  They strongly disapproved of this comparison.  The exceptional baseball skills of nine-year-old Jericho Scott, causing his team to forfeit games, were also discussed.

The show then shifted to a segment heavily featuring listener calls about the perceived coddling of children in youth sports, focusing on Jericho Scott’s situation and expanding into a broader critique of what the hosts viewed as a generation of "wimps." Callers shared anecdotes about overprotective parents in various youth sports.  The conversation veered into unrelated tangents, including humorous and offensive discussions about wrestling, its perceived homoeroticism, and the cruel dog fighting practice known as "trunking."  The hosts also mentioned an upcoming guest, Steve Coogan.

The Steve Coogan interview followed, promoting his film *Hamlet 2*.  The conversation covered his roles in *Tropic Thunder* and the *Alan Partridge* series, reviews of *Hamlet 2*, and his experiences with British tabloids, including rumors of a relationship with Courtney Love.  The interview became tense when questions unexpectedly touched upon rumors linking Coogan to Owen Wilson's drug use, causing Coogan discomfort.  Post-interview, Opie and Anthony discussed the awkwardness, blaming their research team, "Primetime Sam Roberts," for the lack of clarity regarding the Owen Wilson rumors.

A subsequent segment saw the hosts engaging in self-deprecating humor about their past interview faux pas, recounting uncomfortable moments with guests like Craig Newmark, Gene Simmons, Alan Robert, Owen Wilson, Courtney Love, and Al Pacino, often referencing rumors and anecdotes.  They played a song, "It's Cold in the D," and a world exclusive new Metallica song, "My Apocalypse," alongside other audio clips, including a video of a woman delivering a knockout punch.

The final segment included a discussion about an embarrassing photo of a caller, Steve, from his past in a rage rock band, along with a recurring humorous running gag about a listener’s mispronunciation of "Coin City."  The hosts mocked audio clips of Tyra Banks discussing *Tropic Thunder*, and concluded with vulgar jokes, including one about Hillary Clinton's weight, a discussion of a Taekwondo kick to a referee, and repeated promotion of the Ron and Fez show. Throughout the entire broadcast, profanity and highly offensive language were frequently used.

[00:00:30]  I got a piece of the Berlin Wall, and it sat in my apartment for a while,  and no one gave a crap, so guess what?  I don't have a piece of the Berlin Wall anymore.  You threw away a piece of history.  Hell yeah, I did.  I've been tired for 12 years, for the love of God.  Al-Q-Dosis.  One time, the best conduct rate I ever got was a C-,  and the teacher wrote in Brothers' Gift next to it.  Ha, ha, ha, yes. 
[00:01:00]  That was nice and flat.  Jimmy.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  There it is.  Come on.  Will that ever work?  And it's really low.  What?  They don't want us waking people.  Oh, it's you?  That's why.  Oh.  Is it supposed to be A or B, Tim?  Yeah, why would it be A?  Oh, it's B. 
[00:01:30]  It was pushed into the B position.  All right.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony's Show.  Hi.  Call number 877-212-O&A.  Lots to do today.  On this fine, two for Tuesday.  Ugh.  That means twice.  Twice the fun.  What?  It doesn't.  And twice the knowledge from Stunt Brain.  Yay.  Stunt computer.  Stunt Brain couldn't even get Ted Kennedy's age right.  No.  He's in his 60s.  60s?  Did he go Wikipedia?  I guess 70. 
[00:02:00]  What did I say?  74, 75?  I had it.  Yeah, he's up there.  He's going to be 76.  Man, as a guy, if you could get to that 74.  Yeah.  That's the scary ages to get through.  74 and 75.  You get through 74 and 75, you're going to live to like 90, 95 years old.  You'll glide in?  Yeah.  No one dies in their 80s?  Not really.  It's 74.  Look it up.  74, 75 are the key ages for men.  Yeah.  A lot of guys go right around those two ages. 
[00:02:30]  Yes.  Speaking of which, so Ted Kennedy talked last night.  The Democratic National Convention.  Yeah, he got up there and he was kind of let out by somebody.  They led him onto the stage and he kept walking.  They had to turn him around and go, no, Ted, the podium's that way.  Well, he's got half his brain missing.  He's got a big brain tumor thing.  He's got something wrapped around his arm.  Yeah, his left arm had a bandage on it, his hand, and his right hand was shaking like the tremors going. 
[00:03:00]  But he got up there and, you know, he was inspiring his Democratic buddies there.  Well, they were saying on TV last night that, wow, this convention, well, I'll use my own words, is boring.  Yeah.  They were saying, they don't have a plan.  They don't have a focus.  The first two hours is just garbage TV.  And the next thing you know, they're like, whoa, rumors are swirling that Mr. Kennedy is going to come out on that stage and speak. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  He wasn't supposed to do that.  And I guess they got him from a loading dock or something with a golf cart and got him right close to the stage.  And then he got up there and talked.  Yeah, I love the fact that they portray this as a big surprise.  He landed the night before.  Everybody knew where he was.  They had a motorcade, take him to the convention, bring him in the loading dock, put him on a golf cart.  It was no surprise Ted was going to be there.  They had a chair set up for him. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Ted thought he was golfing.  They put him in the cart.  He was asking his caddy for a club.  Aaron, what time do I tee off?  Eh.  I'll lay down.  You hit the tumor out of my head with a seven iron.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Well, the old lion did well last night.  The old lion they're calling him.  Yeah, the old lion.  Yeah.  You know, when you get Carolyn Kennedy crying, whoo. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, she's seen a few things.  That family has seen a few things, yes.  It's their share of tragedy.  Yeah.  They've turned tragedy into politics.  Man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah, so they brought him out.  And, of course, Michelle Obama.  I missed the Michelle Obama.  She was a biggie last night.  Came out with the kids. 
[00:05:00]  And they talked to a big giant screen TV with Barack on there.  I don't understand why.  Why isn't Barack there?  Like, isn't it his convention?  He's the headliner.  You can't, you don't bring out Zeppelin as you're still trying to figure out where your  seat is and you're getting your beers and your popcorn.  Oh, but.  He's the headliner.  Putting him on the big screen was good.  You sure that's the reason?  Or will we only be seeing Barack Obama on big screen TVs from now on? 
[00:05:30]  Especially since they uncovered that plot yesterday.  Wow.  What plot?  Oh, there were a couple of gentlemen in the Denver area.  Some high-powered rifles, scopes, apparently wearing just little Nazi rings and stuff.  And it was uncovered through a traffic stop.  One of these guys kind of, it didn't, felt like doing a little rolling stop, I guess,  through a red light. 
[00:06:00]  No.  And they pulled him over.  They asked, I guess, what, you know, what are you doing here?  You got these rifles?  Are you planning on doing something to, at the convention?  And the guy goes, affirmative.  Oh, they're starting early, these guys.  He was driving erratically.  Yeah.  If you had this on your mind, that you want to get this done, why would you drive erratically?  He was probably, I know this.  I know you're a bit nervous.  I'll put it in terms you can understand. 
[00:06:30]  Sometimes a game comes out at GameStop, and I'm so excited.  I'm driving like, oh, my God, I can't wait.  And I'm driving erratically, because I'm just thinking of getting home and popping the game in  and just enjoying myself.  That's how these guys felt with what they wanted to do.  Well, it was a game to them, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, here's the story.  Oh, yeah.  Here's the story.  Well, three Colorado men are under arrest as federal officials investigate possible threats  made against presidential hopeful Barack Obama. 
[00:07:00]  The first arrest was made Sunday during a traffic stop.  28-year-old Theron Gartrell was nabbed outside of Denver.  Police found two rifles, including one with a scope inside of his truck,  along with a bulletproof vest, some ammunition, and walkie-talkies.  Now, two other men were arrested at hotels.  One was allegedly caught jumping out of a sixth-floor window.  Further details are going to be released at a news conference later today.  Wow.  Yikes.  How many are we up to?  First day of the convention.  Isn't there another?  There was another one or a couple others already? 
[00:07:30]  Really?  Two weeks ago, they found a guy in Denver dead in a hotel room with a pound of sodium cyanide  in the room.  And he happened to be from Somalia with a Canadian passport.  But there was nothing strange about it.  It was just for his head.  Yeah.  He wasn't selling.  They're going to have to get Obama one of these Dr. Evil lairs to live in.  In the middle of a mountain somewhere, right.  Just going to see this guy on television.  Could he be the first closed-circuit president? 
[00:08:00]  President.  Yeah, that never goes out anywhere.  On demand.  The guy is just, I mean, think about this country, this country's history.  First black president, although some black people aren't calling him black now.  That's another controversy.  But first black president.  What are they calling him?  Very controversial.  No, they're saying he's not black.  He's not a black president.  A lot of rappers, a few rappers have come out and said that he doesn't cater to black people. 
[00:08:30]  He doesn't convey the black ideology.  Why?  Why is that?  And then Spike Lee came out in his defense.  Spike Lee believes in what he calls the one drop, not theory, but principle, I guess.  If you have a drop of black blood, you're considered black.  That's what Spike Lee says. 
[00:09:00]  And, you know.  Spike Lee is a crazy person, though.  We all know that.  Of course he is.  He's a crazy person.  What about what rappers were saying that?  It's in the paper.  I forgot his name.  You know, it's some wacky rapper name, so I can't keep track of those names.  But he said that Barack isn't catering to black people and acting.  Pretty much saying he isn't acting black.  Well, they want like a Flavor Flav type guy.  They want him shucking and jiving on the stage.  They basically want Flavor Flav for president. 
[00:09:30]  He said he'll do anything.  That's what he said also.  He'll do anything to get elected.  He'll pretty much kiss ass on Whitey.  It's just like, well, what do you think?  Guy's going to step in there, you know.  In full rap gear.  Like Easy E.  Right.  Circa 1990 or something.  That's cranking up.  How funny would that be?  Yeah.  Some NWA.  Yeah, boy.  Some NWA old school.  They're watching too many bad movies where the black guy becomes president and he's all 
[00:10:00]  like, yeah, I'm the president.  Right.  Yeah, that doesn't quite really work.  When they finally announce Obama later in the week, it's going to be the whitest song  introducing him.  Yeah.  That's another thing.  We've talked about this before, too.  When you watch a movie and you see like black pilots, fighter pilots.  And in the movies, it's like, yeah, he's on target.  Boy, I shot him out the sky.  And then I watch the Discovery Channel.  I watch the military channel. 
[00:10:30]  I see plenty of black pilots and they're like, well, the mission started relatively easy.  We flew over the airfield that we were supposed to take out.  It's like, yeah, that's the guy.  That's the fighter pilot.  He's got to be able to speak to people over the radio.  Right.  Not shucking and jiving.  We've got to go to Carson City.  Rob, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys that Obama, he's getting threats now.  And the KKK is one to think that he is very black. 
[00:11:00]  That's where our biggest problem is going to be.  I can guarantee it.  The KKK?  That's a pretty old organization.  It's probably going to be the Nazis.  It's going to be one nut.  There will be some extremist, maybe an extremist group that will send one of their guys out  or something like that.  The Secret Service is going to have their hands full with Barack.  I mean, it's just the nature of the beast.  It's the way it is.  That's just how it's going to go. 
[00:11:30]  So they're going to have their hands full.  And you can tell.  I mean, day one of the convention and they're getting plots, all kinds of guys, rifles and  stuff.  That's just amazing.  Yikes.  Why are we doing this convention, Stunt Brain?  It looks like a complete waste of time.  I'm one who says it is, but apparently we can't get a virtual convention together and  do it in an afternoon.  It's got to be four days of partying, flying 50,000 people in, burning up the environment.  Gigantic waste of time and money. 
[00:12:00]  We know what's going to happen.  And a lot of tears last night for Mr. Kennedy.  Tons of tears.  But the weird thing, going back to the not black enough thing, Ted Kennedy said, or not  Ted Kennedy.  Ted Kennedy's black?  Like Jesse Jackson said a year ago that Barack was acting white in the terms of the attack  on the strippers.  Remember that?  And then just in January, Andrew Young said he was not acting black enough.  So where's this coming from?  Because it's amazing how black people, it's like they complain about white. 
[00:12:30]  It's like, stop being obsessed with your own race.  We get it.  And he's the first black president.  And if you don't behave a certain way, white people are going to say you're too black.  Or if you don't behave a certain way, you're not black enough.  Shut up.  Yeah, we're just trying to warm up to this right now.  Guys trying to get elected.  Yeah, down the road maybe we'll be ready for a Flavor Flav type president.  Do you think so?  Right.  But right now, give us a break.  We're trying to warm up to this idea.  When Ted Kennedy turned his head last night.  Whoa.  Oh. 
[00:13:00]  What did you hear?  Sloshing.  Wow.  Did you see the side of his head?  What?  They cut out his brain!  The hair is completely missing on the left side of his head.  Really?  Oh, you didn't see that part.  Well, they got to get to it somehow, I guess.  Oh, my God.  I didn't see that, no.  He looked pretty good from, you know, looking right at him.  But then he kind of turned to the side to wave.  And it was a horror show on the left side of his head.  Obviously, you have a giant head, too.  Big, bloated, alcohol head.  The guy does. 
[00:13:30]  He's got a big, fat head.  And he wants to be down there in Washington in January.  Oh, does he?  And everybody in the crowd last night were like, well, you know, that's Ted.  He's the old lion.  He'll be close.  Arlington National Cemetery.  He'll have a good view from the top of the hill.  Jesus Christ.  He'll have one of the best views in Washington.  We hardly knew ye.  Yeah, it's not looking good for Mr. Ted Kennedy. 
[00:14:00]  No.  They said he came from his sickbed.  Really?  Yeah.  It was one of those moments, though.  People are going to remember.  Yeah.  I think you just heard the last, you know, public speech by Ted Kennedy.  His last hurrah.  That was it right there.  So they'll show that during all the retrospectives that they do on his life,  where they show some of his speeches.  Yeah.  And then that'll be the end.  And then his last speech given.  He was a fighter right to the end. 
[00:14:30]  Who knew it would only be two days.  He was working for his country right to the end.  Try to make America a better place for you.  And all the politicians that come out.  He dedicated his life to civil service.  By the way, one of the four guys, if I could believe instant feedback,  one of the four guys arrested in the assassination attempt of Mr. Obama.  Well, it didn't get to that point right.  Yeah.  His name was Adolf.  No.  That's what they're saying. 
[00:15:00]  His name, you think he changed it because he likes how white it sounded.  Yeah.  He probably changed it.  No one names their...  How do you...  What a coincidence that the parents would name this little baby Adolf,  and he'll grow up to be a white supremacist Nazi.  You know, it's...  I think he kind of took the name.  Yeah.  Why, guys?  Why?  Yeah.  There are some angry people in this country that really do not like diversity,  do not like new ideology, 
[00:15:30]  and do not like the idea of a black president.  So they'll, you know, go to great lengths to keep that from happening.  Yeah.  What do we got on the old schedule for the convention today?  Yeah, who's speaking?  We got Hillary speaking today, or...  Yes, today is Hillary's day in the tank.  And it's all...  You know, that Hillary, what a...  Just...  C...  C-word.  C-word.  C-word.  C-word.  She's got to make this all about her still. 
[00:16:00]  She was speaking to the news and to some supporters,  and she's talking about how she will release her delegates,  and she's going to get up there and say that  they should vote for Obama,  and they...  Like, it's all about her.  She could drop off the face of the earth right now,  and her supporters are either going to vote for Obama or not,  depending on what she says.  What's Hillary say?  Who should I vote for?  But that's basically how it always has been. 
[00:16:30]  Ah.  You know, a candidate drops out and then goes,  well, I'm going to vote for,  and now that means you should vote for.  It's part of the process.  Well, the problem the Democratic Party has  is that they were all against each other at one point  when they were trying to get the nomination.  So they have all of them bashing the crap out of each other.  Yeah.  And now all these things are coming up in McCain ads.  Yeah.  McCain is just showing them at debates  while they're giving speeches, 
[00:17:00]  talking about how awful the other candidates are.  I got one of those right here.  I'm a proud Hillary Clinton Democrat.  She had the experience and judgment to be president.  Now, in a first for me, I'm supporting a Republican,  John McCain.  I respect his maverick and independent streak,  and now he's the one with the experience and judgment.  A lot of Democrats will vote McCain.  It's okay.  Really. 
[00:17:30]  Oh.  I'm John McCain.  Of course you approve.  I thought that was going to be one of those.  I know.  We don't have one of those yet,  but we started with that one.  She's a bad actress.  It's okay.  There's some horrendous acting going on there by that.  Louis Beans.  Vote for McCain.  Louis Beans.  Here's the thing.  And then his hand shakes and his face shakes a little,  and there's nothing. 
[00:18:00]  Here's the thing.  First of all, there'll be no second of all.  Yeah.  What Anthony was getting at, though,  yeah, McCain is using some sound bites  where Hillary is, you know, trashing Obama.  Hillary and Joe Biden.  Like, all of them were just beating the crap out of each other.  And the biggest thing with Obama was his lack of experience.  And they jumped on it when they were trying to get the nomination.  And that's something that McCain is using a lot of,  saying that he doesn't have the experience to be president.  And now you've got his own party members in McCain's commercials saying, 
[00:18:30]  hey, this guy doesn't have the experience.  It is a pretty effective, I think, tool that they're using.  Well, Obama has experience now, though.  It's been another year.  Of what, campaigning?  Yeah, but since they said that, he's got another year under his belt.  He's on tour.  Under his belt of being on tour.  Right.  I don't know what he's done in his real job.  He wasn't at work.  No.  No.  None of them were.  Right.  He's got experience, though. 
[00:19:00]  He's been reading.  Hey, how was Michelle Obama's speech?  Was she good?  I cannot stand that woman.  Right.  I don't like her face.  I don't like the things she does with her mouth.  She does some thing with her mouth that annoys me.  All right.  So she doesn't have luscious lips.  And they parade the kids out to wave at the big screen TV at Daddy.  That was quite a moment.  Ooh.  That was a nice hugging moment.  They're waving at a frigging flat screen with Daddy on it. 
[00:19:30]  They're waving at Mac's headroom.  Yeah.  Daddy in the vault.  Yeah.  He's going to do the entire term from a vault.  Yeah.  He's with the missiles somewhere.  In a missile silo.  He's with the missiles in the middle of a desert somewhere.  I want to get the things Anthony doesn't like about Obama.  You don't like the way her lips go when she talks or the way the kids wave at Dad?  I didn't like the way the kids waved at Dad.  Well, that's not really a family man.  So that makes perfect sense. 
[00:20:00]  I don't like this Michelle Obama.  I think she is a phony.  She's a lot more – I think she's not as open to all this new ideology as she likes to put across to the people.  She looks more polished, though.  I think she's –  That last time.  Yeah.  I think she's very, very much into black causes, which could influence the president. 
[00:20:30]  Which – well, yeah, you never know.  These wives, they get in there, they start yapping.  Hillary had an influence on Bill and so did Nancy Reagan.  Especially when she had something to hang over his head.  Holy Jesus.  He did everything she said after that one.  I'm amazed we didn't get that health care thing after.  Yeah.  I know.  At first –  After the old catcheroo.  He had nothing to say about it.  One stained dress later, he's like, oh, Americans need to have everything.  Just listen to Hillary.  She knows.  Hey, before we move on, because we've got to take our first break, this Chuck Schumer. 
[00:21:00]  Well, what is he?  He's a senator, too, right?  Yeah.  He's the senior senator for New York.  Sure.  Of course he is.  This guy is in love with Hillary Clinton.  Oh.  Yep.  Nose constantly buried.  Just thwock.  Where you going, Hill?  You lead the way.  I'll be –  I'll be right here behind ye.  Well, listen to –  He's like a Labrador retriever meeting another dog. 
[00:21:30]  In the back of that pantsuit.  Oh, God.  What a kiss-ass.  And he's the senior senator.  Is he in love with this broad –  Well, listen to this.  Is there some aspect to this that Hillary herself has not been able to control?  I mean, there are people who clearly feel strongly about it, and no matter what her signals are, want to make a stand. 
[00:22:00]  There are a few outliers who will be never happy, but the overwhelming majority of Hillary delegates here at this convention –  and I was the first senator to be for her and the last off –  but the overwhelming majority are going to be for her and for her big time.  What do you think her role will be now in this –  Sorry, for him and for him big time.  We were for her big time.  Now we're going to be for Barack big time.  Old habits die hard.  Exactly.  See, he still wants Hillary as a little confused. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, I know.  For her.  I mean him.  My life for you.  He's got one of those sicko serial killer shrines of her set up in his house.  But I love you.  It's like in Caligula when he was really sick.  Some guy walks in just to try to get Caligula to like him, and he goes,  I would give my life so Caligula would be healthy to Jupiter.  And then Caligula pops up and went, Jupiter accepts.  And they took the guy out.  Kill him.  Oh, is that a great scene. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, what a face.  Jupiter accepts.  Great.  All right.  First break, 877-212-018.  We've got a lot of phone calls coming in.  We'll go to the phones next.  Stay there.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony show.  I want to try something right now.  For the next 15 minutes, we're going to take your poop stories at 877-212-018. 
[00:23:30]  Poop stories for the next 15 minutes, 877-212-018.  We were talking politics, and the phones were like non-existent.  It's kryptonite.  Yeah.  It's phone kryptonite when you talk politics.  But, man, you talk about poop, and those phones are...  Oh.  Get a ringin'.  They light up.  There you go.  You got two already.  They love their...  Amazing.  ...love their poop stories. 
[00:24:00]  You know, we were kind of talking about the Democrats, but John McCain.  Yeah.  I don't know how we got to this point where it's John McCain or Obama.  This just amazes me.  The greatest country in a...  I was going to say the greatest country in America.  The greatest country in the world, and we're down to John McCain and Obama.  It doesn't seem right.  It is just an odd chain of events that brought us here.  There seemed to be other candidates that were a little more reputable on both sides. 
[00:24:30]  But we get caught up in the, you know, what else are you going to call it?  The cult of personality.  We kind of love celebrity.  We like something a little different and a little scary at times.  We just like doing that.  We like things that are like movies.  We like to feel like we're in a little movie.  Interesting things to talk about.  You're absolutely right.  But they got footage on TV this morning, John McCain hanging out with Daddy Yankee.  Daddy Yankee?  He's like the big reggaeton star. 
[00:25:00]  Great.  That's who he's hanging out with.  What is he trying?  You know something?  Don't try so hard to appease everybody and make everybody your pal.  Go with your core constituency and just don't worry about it so much.  I can't stand when people do these phony things like meeting people they would never in a thousand years be around.  I guarantee John McCain has never heard Daddy Yankee's music. 
[00:25:30]  Of course.  I love Daddy Yankee.  Right.  What?  Should rather take a rifle butt to the head again than listen to Daddy Yankee.  That's what the reporters should be saying, though.  I got a question.  Yes.  Mr. McCain, could you sing one Daddy Yankee song?  No.  Actually, when they told me I was meeting Daddy Yankee, I thought I was going to see Yogi Berra.  I didn't know who they dragged out. 
[00:26:00]  Some Hispanic gentleman.  He was also hanging out with the hot Misty May.  Yes.  From Beach Volleyball.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, he's a Beach Volleyball fan, I guess.  Sure he is.  He probably doesn't.  I bet you he didn't even know what sports he played in the Olympics.  I bet you someone had to tell him.  We got Misty May.  She won a gold medal.  Beach Volleyball.  She's going to hang with us today.  He thought it was Beach Volleyball.  That's what they call the women's sports.  I'd like to see him try to go up for the spike.  Hands are straight out. 
[00:26:30]  He can't even play the game.  Hey, by the way, that was just a test.  You can hang up.  We don't want poop stories today.  Yeah.  But you're absolutely right.  Yeah.  It just proves our point.  We're trying to get a little intelligence out there.  Or what we think is intelligent.  Yeah, we talk about the most important thing probably going on in this country right now.  The election.  And the phones were dead.  You say poop stories, phones light up.  Phones.  Ding, ding.  And that's why I love this radio show. 
[00:27:00]  It's all right.  People listen.  I just don't like calling when we talk about this stuff.  Yeah, Daddy Yankee hanging out with McCain.  So that's terrific.  When is he going to pick his vice president?  It was supposed to be on Friday on his birthday, but he hinted yesterday it could be Sooner.  Well, he's stupid.  Who's that?  This is the week.  Bill Sooner.  Bill Sooner.  Very good.  His name is Bill Sooner.  I don't like that guy.  This is the week for the Democrats, so it wouldn't be kind of dumb to announce this week. 
[00:27:30]  I think it'd be kind of cheesy.  Stick to your schedule.  You know, let them have their day and then go do your thing.  You got what they call last licks.  You know, you're up last.  So let them do whatever they got to do.  They'll get a little rise in the polls because that always happens after the convention.  And then the Republicans come in.  They whoop it up and have a big party.  And then their polls go up.  Because for some people, I don't know what it is.  They could sit in front of a TV watching convention and go, ah, now I'll vote for that guy.  Now I like this guy.  And then they watch the Republican one and go, wait a minute. 
[00:28:00]  Now I like this guy.  I got to vote for this guy.  That's America.  The polls are ridiculous.  Steve's face.  Oh, yes.  Oh, I know.  Steve shaved his stuff.  All of his facial hair is gone.  You don't like it, Jimmy?  I don't know.  It's weird.  It is weird.  It looks, it's fine.  He's got a very, he's got a baby face.  Yeah.  A little baby face. 
[00:28:30]  Steve is actually a little boy.  And he had to grow all that crazy facial hair to make himself look tougher.  He's just a little fella inside.  Yeah.  With a very soft heart.  What made you decide to shave it?  Gray hair.  A lot of it in my sideburns and my goatee.  And I just looked at it and I was plucking them out one by one.  I'll just dye them.  I don't want to dye my beard.  I mean, I'm already losing the hair on my head.  I'm getting gray hairs on my sideburns and my beard.  So I figured I'd give it a shave.  You are way too vain.  I am.  I am horribly vain. 
[00:29:00]  There's not a person here that would say, wow, Steve's going gray.  I know that.  This is all self-inflicted.  It's not even a clue.  It would sound like we said he's going gray.  Huh?  It would sound like we said he's going gray.  Oh, yeah.  Why does everything rhyme with that when it comes to you?  I have no idea.  It's just I walk into a room.  I don't think there's any bear traps, but boom, there goes one.  Of course, they're all over the place.  I want everyone on the staff because you're so smooth right now.  Uh-huh.  I want us to have warm Crisco oil and we can all soak our hands in it and just give you 
[00:29:30]  a good crispy slap.  It's actually not that smooth.  I have about eight hours growth on it right now.  That full goatee will be back in a week.  And knowing you, you're going to grow it right back.  Yeah, knowing me, I'm going to be completely vain in the opposite direction and grow it right  back because I'm all self-conscious now.  You know who was using the hair dye stuff on the beard was Lemmy.  Oh.  Because when Lemmy came to, when we were doing the poker thing and we talked to Lemmy, I 
[00:30:00]  was looking at him because we were pretty close there and it was completely gray for about  a quarter of an inch from his skin and then it got black, like jet black, but his roots  were completely gray on his beard.  It's odd.  Very obvious.  A lot of those guys do that.  It's a quarter of an inch of gray hair and then it's black paint.  You don't want to see your favorite band with gray hair.  Let's see in Jimmy Page with a full head of gray hair, old lady gray hair.  Yeah.  It's deeply depressing. 
[00:30:30]  Weird.  Just dye that even if it looks stupid.  Plus, most of these guys you only see, like Lemmy, you only see on stage.  You're seeing them from...  Yeah, you're not going to notice a quarter inch of gray hair.  You know, people aren't getting up that close.  And then when they do, they look at that Coco Puff on the side of his head and they don't  look at his beard anyway.  I think Lemmy's coming into the show soon.  So you can talk about his Coco Puff right to him.  I saw him when I was at the Brooklyn show.  I just saw him briefly before the motorhead went on and they bring me back to see him and 
[00:31:00]  he's just sitting there with no shirt reading a Clyde Barker novel.  That's what you guys do before you go on.  He's such a weirdo.  He really is out of his mind.  He's like a gentleman just sitting there.  A gentleman.  He is a gentleman.  Jack Daniels and potato chips.  Jimmy, you know he co-wrote a lot of those hit Ozzy songs from No More Tears?  Yeah, I know.  I mean, he's got a lot of great songwriting credits.  He's an excellent writer.  He's just a man who drinks a lot.  Of course.  Yes.  Isn't there a Motorhead CD coming out today?  Motorizer?  Wow.  Is that today?  I believe so, yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, it was today.  I thought it was next week.  Yeah, and then you've got the Tiger Woods golf coming out.  That's way more important than a Motorhead CD.  Oh, my God, yeah.  No.  You'll hurt your thumbs with Tiger Woods golf.  Yeah, I got sore thumbs from playing too much Hot Shots golf the last few days.  Hey, Red Sox playing their final regular season series at Yankee Stadium starting tonight.  Yeah, what are the Yankees?  Five games out of the wild card.  Something like that.  Behind the Sox, so they're going for a series.  Well, it's the last year of Yankee Stadium, so every week it's like, well, this is the 
[00:32:00]  last time the Kansas City Royals are going to be in town.  Whoop-dee-doo.  This is going to be the last week that Joe Torre thinks about Yankee Stadium.  Enough.  Yeah, we get it.  Let's move on.  So they got all the big Red Sox, Yankees highlights in the paper today.  All the great things that happened when the Red Sox came to town.  Fantastic.  So there's some good reading in the paper if you're a sports fan.  Am I, dude, am I crazy?  Is Madonna, did they show that, or does she really have McCain right after Hitler? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But is it tied into a bunch of, are they showing a bunch of people in a row?  Yes.  They're doing a bunch of despots, and McCain is in there, and then they do the same with  heroes and Obama.  You know what?  Yes, she is.  Stupid old, liberal, you're a liberal old lady, and you're really out of touch.  Totally out of touch.  The guy took torture so his other POWs wouldn't be demoralized.  He could have left the POW camp early.  Yeah.  Whether you like McCain or not, to compare him to Hitler, it's like, you stupid old bitch. 
[00:33:00]  What a stupid, irrelevant old lady.  The comparison of anyone to Hitler, except maybe that war criminal over there in friggin',  not Chechnya.  Wolfovich?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was a pretty, ooh, he was a pretty bad dude.  But, I mean, comparing anyone to Hitler, eh, you're kind of bringing down, you know, the  damage Hitler did. 
[00:33:30]  You know?  It's like McCain, Hitler.  Nah, I don't think so.  There's a big drop-off between number one and number two.  There's a big drop-off there.  Who would be the number two?  Number two?  Yeah, Milosevic.  You would go with him?  I don't know.  Stalin, wow.  As far as horrific?  But Stalin, it was so secretive.  What about Pol Pot?  Pol Pot.  Pol Pot, yeah, yeah.  Cambodia.  Wow.  Yeah, that was some heavy-duty stuff.  Plenty of skulls to go around.  I'm sure there's warlords, too, that would follow him up there.  The Khmer Rouge, yeah.  I'm sure there's a few warlords whose names we don't know, we just know the results. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Well, McCain is lashing out at Madonna today.  John McCain's campaign hit back at Madonna on Sunday after the pop diva kicked off her  world tour with a concert that bracketed the U.S. presidential candidate with Adolf Hitler.  McCain's campaign...  He's touring with Hitler?  What?  Spokesman.  That's what it sounded like.  Tucker Bonds angrily condemned the segment of Madonna's concert on Saturday that appeared  to draw a comparison between McCain, Hitler, and Zimbabwean strongman Robert Mugabe.  Mugabe, yeah.  But it's just like such an ill-informed, stupid old lady thing to do. 
[00:34:30]  It's like, we get it.  You're an artist.  You're for the liberal.  We get it.  She's been doing this her whole career, though.  But it's like, you cornball.  You old bitch cornball.  Yeah.  Going for the easy target.  Oh, McCain.  He's a dictator.  Is he really stupid?  And I bet the audience just hooted and hollered while they, woo, woo.  Yeah.  Woo.  Madonna. 
[00:35:00]  Woo.  Yeah.  Woo.  Woo.  Sounded like a lot of sirens.  She's done.  She's still trying to wear these sexy outfits on stage.  Look, man.  I wouldn't touch a 50-year-old, but you got to give it to her.  No, you don't.  For 50, you got to give it to her.  The photographs that they take.  Look at that photo.  Put it up on onadradio.com.  What about if, show it from the front.  I think she's sexy.  If she took her clothes off in a room in front of you, you would be disgusted at what you 
[00:35:30]  saw.  Well, there would be a ligament problem.  She's got zero body fat.  Yeah.  Which on an old broad like that, just, ugh.  I'm obsessed with ligaments.  That's the difference between young women and older women.  I'm not a fan of the ligament.  I'm not a fan of the ligament either.  You're right.  Have your ligaments removed.  Even a girl that tones her body a little bit, you know, it's okay.  You don't really see the ligaments because there's still some like what we like to call  baby fat hanging around.  Right.  But you get a little older and those ligaments start to become very obvious. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  So, Madonna's apparent swipe at McCain came during a performance of the song, Get Stupid.  Oh, I get it.  I get it because, ugh.  Towards the end of the song, pictures of Beatles star John Lennon, former U.S. Vice President  Al Gore, Indian Gandhi, of course, and McCain's Democratic rival Barack Obama appeared.  And man, I bet you they were applauding that like you guys said.  Of course.  She's such a predictable old bag. 
[00:36:30]  Just shut your mouth.  The guy, why would you tie him into that?  Are you that shallow as an entertainer?  Like that's always a Republican.  That's what he is.  Hitler.  Stupid bitch.  Shut up.  Yeah.  What did he do that you would equate him to Hitler?  Look at, look at, come on.  Look at that disgusting picture.  Get that picture up on ONA Radio.  Get out of here.  This frigging old hack.  Ugh.  With her affected English accent now.  She's a punch in the nose. 
[00:37:00]  She really is a phony.  Sorry, McCain's not like your fruity polo wearing ex-husband.  Yeah.  I really wish we would have got her brother in here just to listen to him trash her.  No wonder her brother hates her.  Yeah.  There's rumors that she kind of supported that book, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's, yeah.  I heard rumors that she kind of, kind of, eh.  I love how she reinvents herself every so often.  Was part of that whole book thing.  Just for the controversy.  She loves when people talk about her.  Her legs look like tree roots that start growing out of the ground.  Yeah.  Where there's all sorts of stuff going on. 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  I don't want to see a 50-year-old broad dressed like that, dancing around.  I just hate her right now.  If I want to see that, I'll go to the tender trap.  Are they old over there?  Ugh.  Hey, they're fans of the show, though.  I know.  I'm kidding.  Maybe it's the hours when you go over there.  Tugging any local Long Island strip club during the daytime.  You know.  Well, they're going to...  Day stripper.  They're going to call in now and defend themselves.  Sorry.  I bet you they've got some fine young...  Love your establishment.  They've got some fine young snakes. 
[00:38:00]  They've been in there in quite some time.  Hey, is Sam around?  I think we've got the crotch shot video figured out finally.  Primetime Sam Roberts, you mean?  Yeah.  We want this to go...  We want this one to go viral.  Sam, you recut the Pat Duffy video with the Russian broad?  Yeah.  And what do we got?  It's just the nut shot.  It's in slow motion and it's on YouTube.  If you look up, Pat Duffy kicked in the nuts.  Kicked in the nuts.  There you go.  And we'll link that on onaradio.com.  Yep. 
[00:38:30]  Just in case, here's a taste of the audio from that video.  That is just...  It's really amazing.  Listen to this noise.  I swear to God, he wasn't wearing a cup.  Nothing.  Nope.  He took a fine shot to the groin.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Give me one more.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One more.  You're crazy.  Wait.  Good audio.  All right, guys.  Here she goes.  Go.  Holy crap.  I'm leaving.  Holy shit. 
[00:39:00]  I'm leaving.  You're like feeling his pain.  Holy shit.  Dude, I'm dizzy.  And I didn't even get hit.  Wow.  How the fuck can you take a shot like that?  They are fucked up.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  What?  Who gave us this?  Dude, I can't...  Dude!  Wait a minute.  I think it's...  Yeah, it's my fault again.  There were three S-bombs.  Did they get that done?  Two F-bombs.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, Jiven's finger's okay.  How the hell?  No, it's my fault.  Oh, no.  See, I get fired.  I get fired today.  We're going to have to keep an eye on what version goes on this because that happened yesterday.  Yeah, look.  Because there's two versions on the same disc.  It's totally my fault.  That has to be typed better then.  With much more emphasis put on clean and dirty.  Yeah, highlight the thing.  No, no, no, no, no.  What we need by now is never to have this in front of me on this side of the show. 
[00:40:00]  Not that I'm making excuses for myself.  I should have known, but there's no reason to have this as a temptation even to play.  Yeah, why would that be on the disc at all?  Have a different disc burn for the other side.  Yeah, let's...  Christ almighty.  Let's start that tomorrow.  Did they get that down the hall so I could, like, breathe?  All right.  They got that.  All right, here's the clean version of Pat Duffy getting kicked in the groin.  Give me one more. 
[00:40:30]  All right, hold on.  All right, hold on.  One more?  You're crazy.  Wait, good audio.  All right, guys.  Here she goes.  Go.  Holy crap.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  You're, like, feeling his pain.  Dude, I'm dizzy, and I didn't even get hit.  Wow.  How the f*** can you take a shot like that?  They are f***ed up.  Because I deserve it!  Opian Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  Opian Anthony.  Opian Anthony.  XM212.  The virus.  Call the Opian Anthony show.  866-WOW1-WOW.  What the f***?  Wow1-WOW.  Cell phone and PDA users, send your message to feedback at opiananthony.com.  All right, I'm going to start breaking stuff.  Seriously.  Watch this.  All right.  Don't hurt your foot. 
[00:41:30]  Don't break your shoe.  Okay, it's broken now.  Wow.  Now it's...  Now we need a new one.  How many times up to say it?  It usually works, though.  No, now we need a new one.  No, I mean, that usually works in getting a new one.  Now we do need a new one.  Now we need a new one.  Holy Jesus.  What was that, by the way?  This is the CD player that's been messing up...  for like months. 
[00:42:00]  Now we need a new one.  Oops.  How much of an old lady am I?  Don't hurt your foot.  Watch your foot.  You could hurt yourself.  Yeah, it has an error.  Error.  Put it on my bill.  I'll buy a new one for the stupid company.  Ooh.  God.  Yeah, hit me up.  All right.  Back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to everybody.  How you doing? 
[00:42:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  I think I broke my toe  because I'm wearing the wrong shoes to kick stuff to.  Yeah.  I'm not even kidding.  You need your steel toe boots.  My toe is killing me.  I'm stupid.  And the phones are shot today, too.  Yeah, the phones are broken, apparently.  Just like two lines work.  We could get phone calls from our XM audience.  We can't get phone calls from our regular audience today.  Jiminy Cricket.  We knew something was going on because, I don't know,  we had a good conversation about Ted Kennedy and all that 
[00:43:00]  to start the show, and the phones are not ringing at all.  People like getting involved.  So forget about giving out that phone number.  You all right, Jimmy?  My nose hurts today for some reason.  No?  Are you okay?  Yeah, it's just sore.  Oh, good.  I couldn't sleep last night.  I'm just worried.  I get worried.  I watched the final Generation Kill installation.  I haven't seen the final one yet.  Can you believe it?  That's good.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was a really good series.  Let's see it.  Yeah.  I love that show.  I didn't love it.  I liked it.  Yeah, I thought it was very good.  Yeah, it was well acted. 
[00:43:30]  Good characters.  I didn't know if your toe is busted.  I'm not even kidding.  If you can't bend it without excruciating pain.  How about I can't breathe without excruciating pain?  All right.  That could be a problem.  You have to pirouette on your right foot.  Yeah.  That's what I always do.  But I think I have a toe damage.  I picked the wrong day to wear sneakers.  I usually wear boots.  That would have come apart really nice, and I would have saved my toe.  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry.  Can I point out what a phony I am?  Yeah.  My friend texted me.  I'm so glad to hear that you hate Madonna. 
[00:44:00]  You have a signed photo of her in your kitchen, right across from your signed jitter photo.  Jimmy never says that he adores these people or can't dislike them.  He just likes having signed pictures with them.  My name should be Worm Norton.  I am pathetic.  All right.  You got to take those down now, Jimmy.  No, I don't.  I'm coming over today to take those pictures away.  You shouldn't have them up in your apartment.  Can I tell you how funny Sarah Silverman is?  She was at the cellar last night.  She just went in and did a spot. 
[00:44:30]  Mm-hmm.  She is – how could anybody not think she's funny?  Yeah, I think she's very funny.  God, is she hilarious.  Was she talking about the all split?  No, she didn't.  No?  But I didn't see her entire set.  I was looking at the monitor, and she happened to be on.  Yeah.  I didn't know she was going on.  I ran Jimmy Kimmel.  She's not a – Iten.  Some get well card for hysterectomies.  She's just so goddamn funny.  She's just –  What the hell's that?  That's her ass. 
[00:45:00]  That's Sarah's cheeks?  Wow.  Wowee.  She doesn't have an atrophied butt.  No, Sarah always had a good body on her.  She dresses down on stage like she wore flannel and jeans.  She doesn't try to –  Sexy herself up?  Yeah.  Does she have a nose job?  I don't know.  I mean, she looks the same as she's always looked to me.  Yeah, maybe when she was younger.  Maybe like when she was a teen or something.  I don't know why.  Well, Silverman.  Jesus.  What?  I'm just saying.  What type of talk is that? 
[00:45:30]  It's talk that a lot of people –  People?  Of a certain descent?  And it could be Italian because Italians tend to have a large schnozzolist too.  My cousin got a nose job when she was like 18 years old.  She didn't want a big nose.  I'm just saying.  There are certain ethnic backgrounds that are known for certain physical attributes.  Why is that a problem to say?  Why?  Because it's not true.  What?  Oh, damn it. 
[00:46:00]  Run this business.  It's so effed up that you can't just say things sometimes without having to worry about catching flack.  Isn't it true?  We're not all the same.  We're not all the same.  Eventually, we will be.  Hmm?  Yeah, that's what we're working for.  You think?  Yeah, we're going to all be the same color and have the same nose sizes.  I mean, there's no bad or good thing about it.  Some things are just fact.  It's the way it is.  Is it weird for me to say Asian people's eyes are different than Italian people's eyes? 
[00:46:30]  Well, some Asian eyes aren't different.  No, but they are.  The majority are.  Yeah.  It depends what kind of Asian you're talking about.  How's that?  Well, without getting into it, some Asian cultures have different eyes than other Asian cultures.  And the one Asian culture, their eyes aren't that much different than ours.  They're very, like, almond-shaped.  That's the other Asian culture.  Mike?  The one where the Olympics was. 
[00:47:00]  Oh.  No, Chinese.  Have the weird different eyes than a basic what?  No, but any Asian culture, Korean, Japanese.  Japanese.  They're very almond-shaped eyes.  Japanese, not so much, my friend.  Yeah, I think so.  Not as much as where we had the Olympics.  I'm telling you.  You can see different.  The Japanese people look different than the Chinese people.  You can't usually tell the difference.  Koreans look differently.  But Asian eyes are different than Caucasian eyes.  Right.  It is what it is.  It is what it is. 
[00:47:30]  Evolution.  So why can't you just, like, bring it up?  And there are certain other ethnic backgrounds that have certain physical attributes.  It's just the way it is.  So what I was saying was perhaps Sarah Silverman got a nose job.  It just looks like she had one.  She kind of looks like she's got a very nice nose.  I didn't know today was the Let's Get Fired show.  I had no idea.  You could have told me before I came in today.  There is nothing wrong with what I am saying.  And why wouldn't we do it in the beginning of summer where we could go away to some nice 
[00:48:00]  places for a while?  Well, I figure the weather gets a little cold.  We could go down to the Bahamas.  All right.  All right.  The smashing of the CD player messed up our rhythm.  How's your foot?  It really, whatever.  It's fine.  I'm not going to cry.  I did what I did.  Do we have any audio of Michelle Obama's speech at all?  Yeah, we're working on that there, Jimmy.  We were going to play something from Ted Kennedy, but nothing really stood out.  It was a good speech.  It was a visual.  Well, the visual wasn't even that bad.  Well, when he turned his head and it looked like Charlton Heston's buddy in Planet of the 
[00:48:30]  Apes with a shaved head.  Cut out his brain, you bloody baboon.  I said, now we know how John F. Kennedy would have looked if he survived the assassination.  Yeah.  How his head would have looked, because that's what Ted Kennedy had going on last night.  But you know what?  The network news, I've been watching the big screen behind Anthony all morning long.  They refused to show the shot of Ted Kennedy from the side, where it was kind of disturbing  for a lot of people.  Because when you see him straight on, he looks very, very normal. 
[00:49:00]  Extremely normal.  Actually looking like his pops.  You forget that he was JFK's brother.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Because you forget.  Because the Zapruder film is this weird thing.  It's like, I was reading, what's his name, Bugliosi's book, and he goes step by step over  every moment during the assassination.  Yeah.  And he goes over all of what Jackie was doing.  And you just see Jackie crawling on the car and get a piece of the head, and it's just  like this thing we've seen.  It's ingrained in you. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  But you forget, like, this was a lady whose husband had just got shot, and just like  she was holding his head, and she wouldn't let him come out of the car, because she had  his brains in her hand.  It was just really creepy.  But it really humanized it.  This book is great.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm going to read that.  You actually feel sad reading it.  Like, oh, yeah, I forgot.  This is like, the Kennedy assassination.  It's just this thing I was born knowing existed.  Oh, I felt sad just seeing the video myself.  I didn't need to see it in words.  No, reading it's really, really humanized.  That's such a horrific video.  How old would JFK have been? 
[00:50:00]  He's 60.  Well, Teddy's 75, so he would be, what, in his 80s?  Are you sure?  80s?  Maybe 90s.  Well, it was his younger brother, but...  Well, 63, he was how old?  He was about 42?  He probably had 87.  42, let's call it.  Yeah.  So that's 45.  Wow.  He's that much older than Ted.  He had at least 10 years on Ted, huh?  I liked when the Weekly World News would have pictures of him now, and he'd be like, oh, 
[00:50:30]  this exclusive shot of JFK.  Here he is in a wheelchair, and they'd have, like, a picture of JFK, but you could tell they  really badly photoshopped him gray and old.  Yeah.  He's still alive.  All right.  Moving on.  We were talking about this during the break, and it's outraging a lot of people today.  You got a kid.  He's nine years old, and he's really, really good at baseball.  He's a pitcher. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  He's so good that, basically, he's been banned from the Little League team.  Here it is, our wussy nation, where the parents must cuddle their children and not allow them  to play against somebody that's better than them.  Perish the thought they actually play this kid and get better at hitting against him, and  actually makes them a better athlete.  But they'd rather just, no, he's too good. 
[00:51:30]  My child can't play against him.  His name is Jericho Scott, and he's in a league of his own.  That's what the paper's saying today.  Yes, Jimmy?  I'm just reading this.  I want to throw up.  Yeah.  The parents of a nine-year-old prodigy pitcher say their son is being unfairly punished for  his mastery of the fastball, because other teams in the Baseball League of New Haven refused  to share the diamond with him.  Other teams refused to hit against the kid.  That's great.  And know why?  Because the kids are scared to face the nine-year-old's fastball.  Does he do a little chin music? 
[00:52:00]  I think so.  Brush him back a little bit.  Parents on rival teams contend that Jericho Scott's pitches are just too fast for his  peers, and that he should play a different position.  They're just such scumbags, these self-centered parents with their stupid, mediocre children.  They say other kids are too intimidated even to step up to the plate.  Then get your kid out of the dumb league and have him do some of that finger painting,  or make him into a ballerina.  Field hockey.  What if you hit the ball too hard?  Are you going to tell me a line drive coming at you? 
[00:52:30]  If you're playing shortstop, a line drive coming at you is going to come a lot faster  than a pitch.  Recently killed a kid in a line drive.  You lose one or two every year.  Yeah, of course.  What can I tell you?  All the baby turtles aren't going to make it to the ocean.  No.  Here you've got the next Roger Clemens up there in New Haven, and they want him to...  That's like saying, hey, Roger, you're too good.  Could you play right field?  Goodness gracious.  Could you just play right field, please?  Yeah, some team forfeited, rather.  Did you say that already?  No, we're not up to there.  It's unclear how fast Jericho throws since his pitches have never been clocked, but everyone 
[00:53:00]  agrees they are as accurate as they are swift.  So he knows how to throw without throwing at the kids.  He's throwing strikes, basically.  He's a prodigy.  Jericho Stanley has already retained an attorney and is threatening to sue.  Yes, Danny.  I don't know.  I guess that's from the local New York paper.  The Associated Press is reporting that his fastball tops out around 40 miles an hour.  That's it?  Well, for a nine-year-old.  A nine-year-old, that's...  That's it?  Jesus.  He's got to eat his Wheaties.  What a wimp. 
[00:53:30]  I understand how tough it is to be against someone better than you, but that is part of  life's lessons, said the attorney.  There you go.  Last Saturday, a rival team forfeited rather than face the willpower fitness team and  Jericho's fearsome pitches.  Jericho left the mound in tears because neither he nor his team could play.  A little crybaby.  He's nine!  He's a little crybaby.  Jericho is heartbroken and blames himself for his teams not having a chance to compete.  Another game is scheduled for tomorrow, but it's unclear whether that game will also 
[00:54:00]  be canceled.  It's amazing how these coaches and parents can't teach these little Connecticut sissies  to stand there and swing a little earlier.  Take it.  We are raising a generation of wimps.  When I was growing up, I was a pretty good athlete, but I got to tell you, I wasn't good  at baseball.  And I joined the Little League team, and I was one of these kids that was scared to get  in the batter's box.  I was.  I have no problem admitting it.  Guess what I did?  I didn't tell my dad, hey, we got to go make sure these people throw it in slower. 
[00:54:30]  I moved on to another sport.  Yeah.  But nowadays, you don't move on to another sport.  Everyone has to adjust around your weakness.  That's crazy in America.  That is scary, having a fastball thrown at you.  I was never into it, man.  Yeah.  I mean, I would play pickup games with my friends at Washington Drive School, going  local for everybody in the Centerport area.  But when it came to, like, organized Little League, I was a wimp in the batter's box.  Absolutely.  So I moved on to basketball and other sports that I enjoyed much better. 
[00:55:00]  But now they adjust accordingly.  You can't play.  The good kid can't play because the other stupid – it's because the parents are just  so wrapped up in their children.  It's such an unhealthy being wrapped up in their kids.  They can't just say, look, you got to go up and just lose.  Yeah.  Go up there.  Yeah.  Learn to hit.  Learn to hit this kid.  And then you'll look good.  But no.  He can have a sporting career ahead of him, being a great pitcher. 
[00:55:30]  And he probably won't.  By the time he's 18, he'll probably be sick of it and fat.  Doing drugs.  Who knows?  But, yeah, you take a kid like that and you make sure he, you know, reaches his ability,  right?  Yeah.  Kids can't play, you get them out.  Play a different position.  Because my son can't hit very good.  He doesn't want to get the batter's box.  Play a different position.  Parents are the worst.  God, they all think their kids are so special. 
[00:56:00]  Not all.  Not all.  That whole league.  Generalizing.  Not all.  Unfortunately, it's what's going on with America in general.  It's a minority that's taking over.  Is it?  Taking over for the majority.  Yes.  Dude, well, if we had phones working today, this would be a great topic.  I'm telling you, the parents would come out of the woodwork going, we are so effing frustrated.  In our town, this is what's going on.  We do this bid a lot.  These dumb parents.  It's not, I'm telling you, it's not the majority.  But the minority are getting a lot done.  They fight at hockey games. 
[00:56:30]  They're just so obsessed with their children's athletics.  It's so irritating.  Yes, Mike?  If you were the coach of this kid's team, wouldn't you schedule him to pitch every game?  Of course.  Hoping to get a season of forfeits and say, yeah, we won the championship.  We didn't have to throw a pitch.  They should go.  You know, Rob on Long Island, let him make the point.  We got XM calls coming in today.  That's all we got today.  Rob, what's up, buddy?  I know you hate soccer, but when I was a kid, that's all we did was play soccer. 
[00:57:00]  We trounced the New York State Cup for three years in a row.  They made us play two years up against our two years above our age group so that we would  actually not destroy everyone.  And we still made it to the semis, but that's how they dealt with us.  We were too good.  They made us play kids that were two full years older than us.  You know, I think as far as this nine-year-old goes, they should just put them up in the  bigger, you know...  The majors.  Oh, yeah.  Let him play in the majors with his 45-mile-an-hour fastball.  That'll discourage the little effer. 
[00:57:30]  There you go.  But in this case, maybe you let him, you know, pitch for the 12-year-old league.  You know, if he's that good, because he might not be learning anything at that level at this  point.  Learn how to make kids look silly.  But the team shouldn't be forfeiting.  No.  40 miles an hour for a nine-year-old is amazing.  I think so, too.  I mean, Clemens is a pitcher, adult pitcher's pitched 95.  I mean, that's a great fastball.  90 miles an hour fastball is really good. 
[00:58:00]  So he's like...  He's almost halfway there.  He's nine.  At nine.  Then again, you don't double every year.  A little arm.  Yeah.  A little arm thrown that fast.  Jesus.  Let's go to Anthony in Oceanside.  Anthony.  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, just like Opie always said, the Chinese are coming.  That's why they won more gold medals.  They don't do this.  They don't raise wimps.  You're best before you're out.  Simple as that.  These parents make me sick.  I've been saying that for a long time, and I think the Olympics proved that. 
[00:58:30]  I mean, if the Chinese saw this nine-year-old kid, they would be...  He would be playing in their major leagues.  Of course.  He would be in some baseball, like...  Gulag.  Well, I was about to say something else, but yeah, you nailed it.  Yeah, he would be just...  He would have to say goodbye to his family at this point, and they would just have him  pitching 24 hours a day.  Take him away.  But in America, we tell them, no, you better play right field or somewhere else, because  you're too good for that position.  Guess what?  My kid can't play hockey, but he can throw the hell out of a football, and that's just 
[00:59:00]  the way it is.  He's not going to be a hockey player, period.  End of story.  And that's what parents should understand.  I say it all the time, because I've got a lot of nephews and nieces.  I go to a lot of these sporting events, and you see the kids that have no business being  on a baseball field, and then you see the ones that have some skills.  So as a parent, you're going, ah, maybe it's time to make them into a ballerina.  Yeah, they should pick their juice boxes and go home.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, the phones are finally working.  See, we got listeners.  I was terrible at sports. 
[00:59:30]  Terrible.  So what'd you do, though?  You moved on to something else.  I was into science with my telescopes and microscopes and rock computers.  What's a rock computer?  Oh, it was a little thing where I would take a rock and do little experiments on it, and  then based on the results, I would know what kind of rock it was.  Rock computer.  I think I had one of those. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Then I had a, this was before, you know, video games, it was like an airplane flying  thing, and you had a string, a nylon string from like a tree, about 50 feet down to the  controls, and you hooked a little plane on the string, and you had to steer it into the  runway, but it was just guiding down a string.  Like, where's Microsoft Flight Simulator when you need it?  I think, I think rejection is really, really good when you're growing up. 
[01:00:30]  I really, I really did.  I had plenty of that.  By the goddamn gym teachers that, you know, I just wasn't into sports, but they just hounded  me.  Hounded me?  Get dressed.  Get in your uniform.  Oh, you mean my shorts and t-shirt?  Call it a uniform.  Especially those ages, it's all about figuring out what you're good at.  Yeah, well, sports weren't it.  So you, but you moved on to other things.  Certainly did. 
[01:01:00]  And figured out what you were good at.  Hot.  And that's what, that's what the teachers should be moved on to.  That's what the teachers, the parents, the coaches should be teaching the youth.  Yeah.  All right, you're not good at baseball.  That's okay.  Let's, you know, why don't you try this or that, you know?  Uh, let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  The whole thing with this is ridiculous.  I coach Little League Baseball.  I coach Pop Warner.  I mean, baseball's gotten so baby down with pitch counts and you can't pitch if you catch.  It's crazy.  And I played college baseball myself. 
[01:01:30]  There's no way, that's why, you know, you see all the people from the third world countries  become major league baseball players.  We've been baby down baseball so bad in this country.  Yeah, because they're not watering down their, their youth programs.  Exactly.  They're encouraging the best players to be the best.  Watch the, if you saw the Little League World Series during those, if you go over the weekend,  you had a kid from Louisiana throwing 81 miles an hour, which is the equivalent to 105 mile an hour fastball.  And how old is the kid?  12? 
[01:02:00]  12.  Oh, can you imagine?  So in three years, you know, in three years compared to the kid up in Connecticut who's throwing 40,  this kid's throwing double the, you know, twice as fast.  Wow.  Very nice.  And also, you know, think of this, if it's in a Pop Warner game, you, oh, you can't play  running back, you run too fast, we can't tackle you.  You gotta go play line.  You can't do that.  That's ridiculous.  Right.  Right on, man.  Thank you, sir.  Joe and Marilyn, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Joe.  And to me.  Oh, your birthday too, huh? 
[01:02:30]  God bless.  Yeah, it is.  Thanks.  The birthday bit.  Hey, listen, guys.  Nine-year-olds in Little Leagues only pitch from 40 feet.  Oh, really?  So this kid at nine years old throwing 40 miles an hour is the equivalent of probably close  the 90-95 from 65, from 60 feet, six inches, which is a major league distance.  Can we get the little effer in here and then try to hit off the kid?  Hit off him, yeah.  Great. 
[01:03:00]  Let's try to get the little effer in studio.  I'd be scared he'd hit me.  Oh, absolutely.  Even better.  Give Jimmy the wiffle bat.  Yeah.  Oh, you mean like we did in the old days?  The Motley Crue Challenge?  He'd love it.  Me and Steve.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  A quarter inch left for me.  We say hi to Larry.  Hi, Larry.  Hey, how you doing?  Larry.  Larry.  And at nine years old, I mean, 40 miles an hour is not that fast.  I mean, I coach Little League and my son's on a travel team.  And that's what you're facing in these travel teams is, you know, between 35 and 45 miles 
[01:03:30]  an hour.  It's nothing special.  Yeah.  And, you know, the same thing with everybody else is saying.  They're watering down baseball.  They've got to let the kids go out there and play.  If they can't play, go pick another sport.  Let them play baseball.  Let them excel.  And if they don't do good, they don't let them go play fit and field hockey.  You know, that's what it is.  There you go.  Very good.  You know what I'm saying?  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Billy in Tennessee.  Billy.  Hey, fellas.  I just want to chime in on this.  Please, please, please.  When I was growing up, I'd fell in all sports.  Got a little cocky.  My dad put me in wrestling. 
[01:04:00]  I got my high-end kick for the whole first year until I got better.  Gay sport, by the way.  He didn't allow me to quit or anything.  Yeah, gay sport.  Yeah.  Wrestling.  Yeah, the gym teacher was trying to get me into wrestling because I was the weight they  needed.  And I'm like, ah, no thanks.  Yeah, that in gym class.  I didn't, you know.  One day, we go in and say, oh, we're going to wrestle today.  And I'm like, all right, what the hell is this about?  So the mats are all out.  And this big douche, I have to wrestle him. 
[01:04:30]  And you get in that position where you're on all fours.  And the other guy's got his arm around you and on the one arm.  And then this stupid gym teacher goes, and I got thrown around the mat.  He grabbed me at one point, that between the legs grab.  What is that?  And like, just smashes me down on the mat.  I went like, ow!  Like, as he was grabbing my junk.  And it hurt.  Like a tiger grabbing a gazelle. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, I was just down in a second.  You were just being shaken about.  And then he gets up after he pins me or whatever the frig it is.  He sexually abused me.  He gets up and he looks at me and does this neck twist from one side to the other.  Like, yeah, that's how I kick ass.  Stop it.  You frigging, you like grabbing sweaty men in tights.  You had to go to the nurse's office for a rape kit.  For a rupture.  After you're wrestling. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Well, that is the weirdest thing.  You're growing up, right?  And the hormones are a-rage.  Yes.  You got all sorts of things going on in your body.  The girls aren't icky anymore.  No.  All hell's breaking loose inside your body.  And then you got a dumb gym teacher encouraging you to get on a mat with another guy.  Yeah.  What?  All right.  You get the bottom.  Right.  He gets the top.  It's like bottom and top.  And now we're rolling around on a mat and touching, like touching any place goes. 
[01:06:00]  Sure.  They grab ass.  They're grabbing, like, around the- that one move where they grab under- between your legs  from the back and grab the front and try to flip you over.  It's like, of course you're flipping me over.  I'm in pain.  This is a torture move.  Yeah.  Oh, wrestling.  Yuck.  Sweaty guys on a mat.  Let's say hi to Chris in Boston. 
[01:06:30]  Chris.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, listen.  I got the same issue as this kid's parents.  Listen, my six-year-old son plays T-ball.  And every time we play a game against these other teams, all parents complain that my kid  hits the ball too hard.  So it's like, he's six years old.  You know what I mean?  How do you hit the ball too hard at six years old?  Six years old.  They'll move all the kids to the other side of the field, let my son hit the ball, and 
[01:07:00]  then move all the kids back to their positions.  I was like, Jesus Christ.  Stop being pussies.  Play the game.  They're six.  I say holla to that, my friend.  Yeah, at least you don't have the kid that they go, easy out, easy out, easy out.  That's got to be nice for the parents.  Oh, God.  Nothing worse.  Get him into something else.  Nothing worse than when they move the outfield into the infield.  Bring it in.  He can't hit.  He can't hit.  Bring it in.  Easy out.  And the parents are just like, the father's, my son's a pussy. 
[01:07:30]  Ah, yeah.  All right, look, the phones are really good.  We're going to go right back to the phones after the break.  Yes, don't go anywhere.  Yeah, please don't, because the phones are finally working two hours into our radio show.  So stay right there.  If you're on hold, we think you're good enough to be on the show.  So stay there for us, okay?  New socialism starts in sports.  What's this about there, Stunt Brain?  The parents want everyone to be the same.  Yeah.  No big winners.  I'm telling you.  This is a slippery slope.  Hold on, though.  I go to a lot of sporting events. 
[01:08:00]  It's not every parent.  Yeah, but most parents are frustrated.  Like, why are they running the league like this?  Why does this one parent have so much power in our town?  Why don't they speak up?  They try to.  Why don't they beat up the one parent that's being a douche?  It's easy to say that all parents are into this.  I'm telling you, it's not the truth, what I've seen.  But the control has already been handed over.  The kids are not taught that there is a Darwinian experience in life, that winners and losers happen.  And then when they get to college or they get to the office and they don't win, they're like, what happened? 
[01:08:30]  I won everything.  Nobody lost.  We're all winners.  And this is translating right on down to what you're hearing from Washington when they're talking about shared prosperity, that a company can't make too much money.  Well, there is a minimum wage in this country.  There is not a maximum wage.  But we're headed that way.  And they're going to start taking things away from people who do too well.  We are becoming wimps.  This is a dangerous thing.  And they're starting to indoctrinate the kids.  I tell you, people, if we don't uphold the principles of capitalism, we are headed towards communism. 
[01:09:00]  I've got to go lay down.  Penn and Teller on Bullcrap did a great job of talking about how they attacked the anti-war protesters.  And they say commerce is the best way to avoid war.  People are buying and selling from each other.  That is a weird basic respect.  That's true.  You know, capitalism is basically what they're saying prevents a lot of fighting because you're making money off each other. 
[01:09:30]  They're like, it's not about anything but that.  And they were right.  It's like you look at the countries that are getting along.  Well, we're selling and trading with each other.  Who's into this?  Who's into this shared prosperity?  Obama.  Obama's the one who said we need to start taking away from some of these oil companies who make 8% profit.  Yeah, the number looks big, but they only make 8%.  You make 8% as a businessman.  You're barely getting by.  So the shared prosperity thing is a really dangerous socialistic principle in terms of upholding what we stand for as a capitalist society. 
[01:10:00]  You know, there's a good thing that is happening with the high gas prices.  Anyone else read this today in the paper?  No.  Good thing coming out of the fact that gas was $4 a gallon for most of the summer.  What's that?  I'm going to tell you next.  Look what I do.  You know, Jimmy?  No.  I'll tell you about a good thing that is happening because gas is $4 a gallon.  People aren't drinking it?  Oh!  Opie and Anthony.  We're going to go right back to the phones. 
[01:10:30]  The one guy I wanted to go to just hung up.  Ain't it always the way.  Basically, he, in his town, if you beat a team by too much, you have to take like a sportsmanship class or meeting.  You have to learn about sportsmanship.  Yeah, boy.  That sucks.  We're just embracing people's weaknesses and almost apologizing for being successful.  It's this stupid guilt thing in the U.S. 
[01:11:00]  It's the same way we are around the world.  We're just too apologetic.  We're just sissies.  Silly.  Where did that start?  Well, Carlin's brilliant, his brilliant attacks on the baby boomers and just how soft, because they were handed everything.  Carlin did a thing about how after, how they were given everything in the 60s and they took it all and then they just, they got really soft.  And that's who he blamed it on.  I agree with him.  All right, let's go to the phones before we lose these people.  Well, Susan in Boston, listening on BCN, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:11:30]  Hi, how are you?  Good, Susan.  My son plays Pop Warner and he plays, you know, he plays hockey.  And this whole mercy rule thing and no winners and losers, it's all about the parents.  Because the parents can't handle watching their kids lose.  My son, he's gotten his ass handed to them, 12 to 1.  They deal with it.  And the kids forget about the loss like five minutes after it happens.  And it's all the parents that can't deal.  It drives me crazy.  Yep.  Yeah, they got that mercy rule. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Like, stop the game.  Well, it's fine.  But it's like parents that have to do their jobs.  It's like they want everybody else to do it for them.  It's like sometimes you got to explain to your kid, hey, look, it happens.  You're not that good at this, but you're enjoying it.  So what?  Walk it off.  Yeah, that's what I say to them.  You know, sometimes you're not going to win.  Even when you play as hard as you can, you're still going to lose.  It happens.  It's life.  And that's, thank you.  And that's life.  And that's why I think it's important that the kids learn the lesson early.  Sometimes you stink. 
[01:12:30]  You know, sometimes I think parents in general don't want to see their kids upset or sad.  So this is how they work around that.  When you should embrace the sadness and teach them, well, this is what life's all about.  Yeah, and sometimes you just got to play a little harder next time, and you still might not win.  But that's okay.  You know, you'll learn how to come back from something like that.  Right on, man.  All right, let's go to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, I'm an umpire for Little League Baseball.  I see it all the time. 
[01:13:00]  They tell us not to.  We can't call a kid out on strike three.  We can't, you know, we pound him out.  Strike three, you got to say.  Oh, that's strike three.  But we don't do it.  But going back to the mercy rule, I had a game that was 33-2 in the third inning.  Well, I think the mercy rule should come into effect if you're winning by, like, 50, let's say.  Yeah.  But their mercy rule is, like, 10 runs or something.  It's 10 runs after four innings, but it was only the third inning. 
[01:13:30]  And I thought I was getting tired, so I called the game because of darkness, but it was still light outside.  But this guy's hilarious.  It's hard even on the umpires because, you know, we have to play both sides of the field there.  You got to let the kids play, and then they don't want you to, you know, be embarrassed or anything.  But it's a tough life.  I agree with you guys, though.  We are raising a bunch of sissies. 
[01:14:00]  When I was in the championship game in Little League, the Royals, we were not that great, but we made the championship, and we lost.  I believe it was 13-2.  We got our asses.  Oh, close.  Beating.  And I was up last.  It was one out in the ninth inning.  There was a runner on first.  And I was so awful as a hitter that they had the runner go.  I had two strikes on me because they figured even if I did hit it, it would be a weak double play ball.  So the runner ran, and I just flailed impotently at the ball. 
[01:14:30]  Strike three.  And then they threw him out.  Championship game is over.  You were the last out or pretty much the cause of the...  Yeah.  Because I couldn't make contact.  I'm not like would have made up that much...  Doesn't matter.  It's the point.  It is the point.  You were the one that screwed it up.  I'm the same boy that once hit a dribbler, and it went up the first baseline, and it was foul, and I just stood there in the batter's box, and everybody is screaming,  Run!  Go!  Run!  No!  I was so embarrassed because I'm like, it's a foul ball. 
[01:15:00]  And then I just saw it roll back fair, and you've never seen anyone just take off so late in the game.  The pitcher was already picking it up and throwing it by the time I broke out of the batter's box.  I got like two feet, and I was just out.  You were awful.  Sucked.  So I worked out okay.  I mean, you know, from there, you move into alcohol, drugs, and that thing.  Self-hatred and comedy.  Yeah, there you go.  Let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to say, these parents are stupid. 
[01:15:30]  I mean, they have a chance for their kids to play with what could be one of the greatest  baseball players of all time, and they're taking it.  Oh, my kid's not good enough to play with them.  I mean, so look at Tiger Woods.  If someone told Tiger Woods when he was young playing golf, oh, you're too good.  You're playing football.  What would he be now?  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Well, how about they don't do it in school?  Like, when a kid is too smart in math, he's embraced, or she's embraced.  They don't say, ah, could you dumb it down a little bit?  Why is that acceptable?  They give out awards. 
[01:16:00]  They give out for best math, best science.  So why don't they just ask you to dumb it down so the other kids don't feel stupider?  How great would school be, though?  Yeah.  If everybody got A's, more time to, you know, play some of that tonsil hockey.  Let's go to Craig in New Hampshire.  Craig.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I used to coach back for 10 years.  I coach all the kids, like 15 through 18.  And I tell you, parents call these kids big time.  I had this one kid.  His mother came up and said, he goes, he cannot play first base or catcher because if the ball hits him, he's going to bruise very easily. 
[01:16:30]  So I'm like, I go, okay, then why is he playing baseball then?  And then I had another kid.  My coach and I were sitting there.  I was like, what the heck is going on with this kid?  And come to find out, he was a left-handed kid, but his father refused to buy him a proper glove.  So he was throwing the ball right-handed.  Well, yeah, because if you're left-handed, you're the devil.  Yeah, exactly.  And I'm left-handed.  So I went to the father.  I go, hey, I have a glove.  I'll let him borrow for the game.  He'll have to go buy one.  He goes, no, no, you've got to stay right-handed. 
[01:17:00]  I go, you've got to be kidding me.  My kid's no freak.  Oh, yeah.  And the sad thing is, I put him out right field.  I have my center fielder playing right center right next to him.  And I go, whatever you do, catch the damn ball.  I don't want him touching the ball.  Oh, it was a circus out there.  And I tell you, the parents nowadays, they call their kids, they think that.  And also, too, after a bad game, they go, oh, you did great.  Don't worry.  You struck out three times.  Don't worry.  You made contact.  And I tell you, the parents, that's why I got out of coaching.  I have two daughters right now who are eight years old, and I won't coach them at all. 
[01:17:30]  I'll coach them at home, but I won't do the team aspect.  I'll let them, with the parents, do it.  I'll do the thing at home with them.  How many, what percentage of the parents do you think are just ball busters and real  pains in the asses?  I probably dealt with about 60% to 70% of them.  Wow.  They're overly concerned, right?  They're overly involved.  Oh, yeah.  I'll get phone calls at 11 o'clock at night.  After a game, they're signed at 10 o'clock.  I get a phone call from my father.  I go, well, how come my son didn't play today?  Well, let me see.  Your son showed up late for practice, and especially these kids have started getting  their licenses. 
[01:18:00]  They're driving now, so they think they're cool.  And these kids don't think they have to come to practices.  And I tell you, the most frustrating thing I ever dealt with, I mean, I went bald pretty  much and have gray hair in 10 years.  And I'm only 28 years old.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to move on because the phones are just really lit.  Jim in Lindenhurst, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I used to coach peewee football for the Leavittown Red Devils.  And one year.  What's funny? 
[01:18:30]  What have you guys played?  No, no.  It's a peewee thing.  No, of course.  Peewee football.  It was.  Sounds ridiculous.  It was quite brilliant.  Go ahead, Jim.  Not a problem.  Yeah, no.  One year, I had a parent from another team come up and petition to me.  They wanted one of my kids removed from the team.  Why?  Because he hit too hard.  Because he hit too hard.  They were petitioning to get him removed from your team.  Yeah.  Because he hit too hard and he was bruising the other players. 
[01:19:00]  What are they, pieces of fruit?  Apparently, that's what they must think they are, is pieces of fruit and padding.  Right.  So, some of these parents are absolutely ridiculous with how much they coddle their kids and,  oh, poor baby, oh, poor this.  Give me a break.  You want this kid to play a sport, you know, let him play the damn sport.  And then go play another sport that they might be good at.  Not everyone's going to be a good baseball player.  Seriously.  Or football, you know.  I mean, the kid hits hard.  He's seven years old. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  You know, I mean, please.  All right.  Parents' stupid dreams.  It's more than most on the field, too.  Right.  Thank you, Jim.  Let's go to Greg on Long Island.  Greg.  How are you doing?  I was one of those kids in junior high, I guess, that had no business being out there  in baseball.  So, I picked the outfield all the way out there, and there was a little stream in the  woods.  Oops.  And some stupid kid actually hit a ball way out there, so I grabbed the ball and I threw 
[01:20:00]  it back into the field, and I was like, good, that's good enough for me.  Now I can go play with the frogs.  And I played with the frogs right through the period was over, and I get back out there  and there's nobody in the field.  And I was about 10 minutes late for my next class.  Accounting?  I don't know what it was. 
[01:20:30]  Just an assumption.  Sounds like you're still playing with the frogs, sir.  I wasn't successful in that class either.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  Chuck in Jersey.  Chuck.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How's it going?  Good.  Years ago when I was playing Little League ball, my dad wanted to coach.  And he went to the town rec center and he told the people he was interested, and they  said, that's great.  What can you teach the kids?  What's the one thing that's most important?  And he says, I want to teach the kids how to lose. 
[01:21:00]  And they all just looked at him like, what are you, crazy?  And he's like, you never see a sore winner, do you?  And believe it or not, they wouldn't let him coach because of that.  Because he thought losing is a good thing.  It's probably the extreme, though.  Just wants to lose every game.  Right.  Go out there and don't do anything.  I'm going to teach them how to get into male relationships and bottom.  Right.  This is where we're leading to this whole phone conversation is developing here. 
[01:21:30]  Watch this.  Scott in Boston, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, I just thought I'd talk about how pathetic some of these parents would get.  And I've had an 18-year-old actually show up with his mother for a job interview.  Wow.  For what?  What was the job?  For a forklift operator.  And he brought his mommy?  That's sad.  What did she have to do with it?  He's going to fail.  I hope you guys.  She wanted to make sure he didn't say anything stupid or help him get the job. 
[01:22:00]  It's just terrible.  I hope you guys gave him a forklift wedgie after mommy left.  Or just drove it into his chest and killed him.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Dave in Medford.  Dave.  Good morning, guys.  How are you doing?  Good morning, Dave.  You know, Opie, you said something half-kidding a little while ago.  I'm a school teacher.  And you said, you know, like, oh, wouldn't it be great if everybody gets an A?  That's somewhat the way it's become.  The average grade has really become, if you're an average student, a B, B+, and if you're  doing something a little bit above average, you're maintaining around an A average, at 
[01:22:30]  least in, you know, the area where I work and some of the areas around me.  That's the way it is.  I always got the not working to his potential.  Yeah.  That was what I got.  Even not working to his potential, you're still passing.  You're still doing fine.  At least today it is.  I mean, the coddling has really gotten pretty extreme.  I passed in stuff.  Elementary school, I'm talking about, you know, when I was a little kid.  Uh, my report cards were always like, it was good, but then they always had to turn the 
[01:23:00]  screws on me.  Like, oh, Anthony is very, um, uh, nice.  He plays well with the other children.  He's a good, uh, uh, student.  He listens.  Uh, but Anthony is not working up to his potential.  Okay.  You know what my potential is.  You're like 24 years old, the teacher, they always seemed older back then, but you realize  they were just dopes that were just out of college.  Yeah.  Barely older than yourself. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Well, a little older than me, but you know, and then, and then you're like, my potential.  How do you know what that is?  Come here.  I'll show you my potential.  You little bitch.  The inflated way is give them this inflated sense of self.  And then they don't understand why they're getting booted out of college within the first  semester or, you know, two semesters end.  Well, sir, it's like I always say, spare the rod, spoil the child.  I say that often.  Yeah.  Even out of context.  I'll just say it in the middle of a discussion about something else. 
[01:24:00]  We got, this person got, uh, says they were so bored that I got disrupted others.  Oh, really?  There was always those things on those report cards.  I don't even know if they have those like that anymore, but, uh, this was like first  grade through sixth grade or something or fifth grade, they'd give you the report card that  you'd have to take home and get signed.  And there'd be little comments from the teacher.  Disruptive.  He has a, uh, seems like he doesn't, uh, nap much. 
[01:24:30]  That was another one.  Like, oh, tired, tired during the day.  Maybe, maybe he got a good night's sleep.  Yeah.  I think it's, it's better to not nap during the day.  Right.  I mean, you're like responsible and you're going to bed at a decent hour.  Responsible.  You're in third grade, but your mommy's making sure you go to bed.  Yeah.  Instead of staying up all hours of the night.  Hey, we got to go back to wrestling.  Cause you, you made fun of wrestling.  We got a wrestling coach on the line.  All right.  Chris in Jersey.  What's up?  Here we go.  How you guys doing?  Defend your, defend your homoerotic sport. 
[01:25:00]  Actually, I'm not going to defend it.  I think it's pretty funny.  And if you're not involved, I could see how you kind of could see it that way.  But the good thing about wrestling is you can't have sort of forced winners or, uh, you can't  protect, uh, the kids from learning.  Uh, if you win, you win.  It's a one-on-one sport.  And, uh, you know, top and a bottom.  You actually get more points for kicking the crap out of somebody. 
[01:25:30]  So it's kind of a good thing in that way.  And that there's no way to sort of have parents involved saying, oh, you know, uh, you can't  beat him that bad or he shouldn't be wrestling because he's too good.  So, uh, just wanted to say, you know, with these other teams.  Yeah.  You're just missing the point, though.  When you're like a kid growing up and you got hormones of raging, you know, now you're  being forced to touch another boy.  You're like, ugh.  Yeah, I don't know about it.  I don't know about making kids do it who don't want to do it. 
[01:26:00]  I think you would get a lot more guys into wrestling if you, if you made them wrestle.  And I don't know, like, like what the Knights used to wear back in the day, some armor, a  lot of armor.  So, so you don't, so don't, so you don't have your elbow in a soft, mushy area.  All of a sudden, it's just the whole sweaty man on man thing.  That is just the biggest turnoff.  Jesus, your face is in his armpit.  All right.  He's got a good hold on him.  It's like, yeah, he certainly does. 
[01:26:30]  Look at that.  They just feel that like the UFC and stuff.  I love it.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Look at it.  Look at where his head was.  It was right in his junk.  Now he's, now he's doing a thing that that's gay porno.  A couple of men.  And you know, you just smell like another man when you're done because it's just rubbed all  over you.  Oh, that wrestling.  A couple of men just kind of getting tangled up.  Yeah, right.  You know, the Greek used to do that naked.  Of course they did.  By the way, they would wrestle naked.  They're all tangled up. 
[01:27:00]  It's kind of hard to determine who the winner is.  They both win as far as I'm concerned.  Settling things like men.  Oh, those Greek.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  We appreciate it.  Did anyone else see what's going on in Greece?  A lot of ASEC's.  ASEC's.  Well, you know, the Olympics were there in 2004.  They did a piece on NBC over the weekend to show everybody what happened to the old facility  or the facilities.  And they're just all, most of the places are just rotting away in Greece. 
[01:27:30]  Really?  Yeah.  They built a stadium.  What was it for?  Softball?  Softball.  Softball.  Like a state-of-the-art softball stadium for the 2004 Olympics.  And it turns out that no one plays softball in Greece.  So this place is just rotting.  How is it that Greece also has stuff that is still there after thousands of years, yet  something from the last Olympics is falling down? 
[01:28:00]  Well, they just show that they're not keeping up with these places.  But maybe they're just used to, yeah.  They're keeping up with the Parthenon?  Maybe they're just used to seeing just crap everywhere they look.  So they're like, to them, this is normal.  More ruins.  Right.  This is great.  People love coming to Greece to see ruins.  It's about time we have brand new ruins.  I'm sick of looking at the old ruins.  You're right.  People don't like looking at new buildings.  They come here to look at old buildings.  You're so right.  We're making new ruins.  I thought it was outrageous, but I think they know exactly what they're doing over there. 
[01:28:30]  They're just building new ruins.  Stupid me.  Hey, do we have time to squeeze in some trunking?  Is that a wrestling move?  Ah, trunking.  Trunking.  Trunking is...  He's trunked him, obviously, as he screams in pain.  He loses the match.  Trunking is all the rage, my friend.  You want to guess...  Trunking?  Oh, by the way, the gas thing.  I forgot to tell everybody.  Yeah, I was going to ask about it.  Okay.  Oh!  One thing that is coming from the fact that gas is over $4 a gallon this summer.  Mm-hmm.  Yes. 
[01:29:00]  Less people are dying on the roadways.  Is that good?  A lot less people are dying on the roadways because there's less cars out there.  Less cars.  So a good thing happening because gas is so high.  Less traffic, right?  We are probably talking to someone out there that was supposed to die this summer.  Gee.  But because gas was $4 a gallon, you are still alive, my friend.  Mm.  Yes.  Wow.  They should save a lot of lives and make it $100 a gallon.  Yes, they should.  It's now $7.55 and I have officially been bombing for an hour and 55 minutes. 
[01:29:30]  You stink.  I don't think, I don't notice how goddamn awful I have been all day.  My apologies to the audience.  I have been terrible since 6 o'clock.  Oh, Jimmy.  But ill-timed comments, not insightful or funny, just stupid. 
[01:30:00]  But you didn't go home.  Dude.  You're still trying.  Right.  You're still trying.  You know, you're stepping up to the plate.  Not like these wimps were raising out there.  And missing.  Dude, I literally, I haven't had a base at all day.  It has been nothing but laughing at everyone else's jokes and bombing horribly.  I'm sure you'll rally back.  You always do.  The last hour is going to be yours.  Oh, yeah.  Quarter to 11.  Watch out, folks.  We got Malik from The Hood, Asbury Park, checking in. 
[01:30:30]  What's up?  Yo, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, Malik.  Yeah, I mean, I think this thing with the Little League and Pot One only happened in the suburbs.  Because I know out in Asbury Park, you know, the Pot Warner team, these little kids, they go to the Super Bowl every year because they bang hard.  Their parents are telling them, if you don't hit this kid hard, then I'm going to hit you when you get home.  My little nephew's 12 years old, and he's out there every Sunday playing with 30-year-old men getting tackled.  Malik's on to something. 
[01:31:00]  Because, you know, back in the day, I became pretty good at basketball, and we had to play the black teams.  And, you know, you got kids that's 12 years old that's touching the backboard, and they're dunking at 11.  He's not even joking.  How do you play guys that are dunking at 11?  Dude, he's not even joking.  We would play Amityville, Wyandanche, Malvern.  Oh, yeah.  Going local for Long Island.  They understand.  And these kids were dunking and stuff.  And you wanted them to, you know, check their birth certificates. 
[01:31:30]  Like, it's like, come on, how is this kid still in high school?  You know what's so cool about that, though?  It seems unfair, but their children got such a kick out of watching them play that it was well worth it.  Yeah, I mean, that's why I think the differential with the sport, you know, it comes into, like, different neighborhoods.  Because I know you got, you know, your suburban areas.  You know, you have your soccer moms.  Don't hit my kids.  They're going to bruise in the hood. 
[01:32:00]  Yo, look, that's all a part of the game, baby.  If you don't get knocked down, you know what I'm saying?  You ain't playing the game right.  Get your head back in the game.  Turn your helmet back around from, you know, the side angle.  Yeah.  Let's rock.  That's how we play.  You know what I'm saying?  No, it's funny.  I've told the story a couple times, but I think it was Amityville where they had a curfew.  So we had to have the basketball game before darkness set in.  They're under a curfew.  And I went to a pretty white high school, Harborfields. 
[01:32:30]  Pretty white.  We had some black kids, and we had a couple kids on the team.  And they would strut down the hall like they were ghetto, and they would wear the latest fashions of the day that the brothers were wearing in the hood, right?  Yeah.  And then we would go to Amityville.  And then you would look for support on the bench because you're, I'm not kidding, as a 15, 16-year-old, you're scared to death.  Yeah.  Because you're not used to this atmosphere.  You're playing against men.  Right.  Grown men.  So I looked down the bench.  His name was Cornelius for a little support. 
[01:33:00]  Like, what do we do, bro?  Cornelius.  This is your world.  I swear to God, that was his name.  I'm like, this is your world.  What do we do?  And he was just as scared as Whitey.  Yeah.  Just as scared.  He was a fake ghetto kid in our high school.  Yeah.  Completely fake.  Because when it came down to helping us out, he didn't know what to do either.  Remember, one of the perceived black people from your school was Mariah Carey.  Yeah, true.  It's about as black as they got in Harborfield.  Yeah.  She ran the gang.  Yeah.  In Asbury Park. 
[01:33:30]  They don't have night games in Asbury Park because it may be shooting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's not the only reason.  All right.  I said she ran the gang.  Yeah, I know.  I should be just shocked.  All right.  Thank you, Malik.  I know we got to take a break, but we got Josh in Indiana.  Josh.  Hey there, Josh.  Morning, fellas.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Aw.  Thank you.  I'm going to.  I got a story about wrestling in middle school that backs up what Ant said. 
[01:34:00]  I was in the sixth grade and my father intimidated me into trying out for the wrestling team  of which I had no idea what I was doing, and it always seemed kind of homoerotic to start  with.  So I'm at a meet, and I have to wrestle a guy that's older than I am.  Yep.  Yep.  Yeah.  And, well, let's say he put me in a half Nelson, and when, you probably don't know much about 
[01:34:30]  wrestling since it is homoerotic, but they flip a person over via a half Nelson on their  back, and when he did that, his junk was directly in my mouth.  See, that's not a sport.  You're right.  It's horrible.  They are just covering each other in any way possible, and, yeah, very inappropriate areas  end up in your face, and it looks like you're, you know, when you see one guy in his stomach 
[01:35:00]  and the other guy's trying to flip him over, and he's spread eagle on top of him?  Yeah.  What is that?  Yeah.  One man flipping another.  Yeah.  All right.  Let the contest begin.  Answer me this, then.  Why weren't there more gay guys in high school doing the wrestling?  Who knows?  Well, come on.  You had the theater kids.  Why weren't they also wrestling?  Those were the known gay guys.  Why weren't they a two-sport?  Let me tell you.  When you get football teams that go off to football camp and abuse some of the kids with 
[01:35:30]  pine cones, they're hiding something.  Yeah.  They're hiding a little thrill that they get.  There you go, Jimmy.  That's right.  8.02, 122 minutes into the program.  Finally a double.  That was a nice one.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Josh.  Thank you.  When we get back, we're going to tell you what trunking is all about. 
[01:36:00]  Trunking?  Mm-hmm.  I can't figure that out.  We have to promote our guest.  We have Steve Coogan today at 8.30.  What?  Steve Coogan from Tropic Thunder and Hamlet 2.  One of the funniest shows ever.  I'm Alan Partridge from England.  Great.  Probably could have done a better job promoting that.  Good.  Let people know he's coming.  I just mentioned the name of the show, and then you went to it.  Notch your teeth, and the star brain stood there. 
[01:36:30]  Describe what everyone did.  I love the...  He's got a hand on the button.  He's looking at the monitor.  I love the listeners that get so mad when all we're doing is trying to make jokes.  Danny Miller from Philly, he writes,  You fags, you have WWE wrestlers and UFC fighters in all the time  and are so afraid to say controversial S,  but now you're making fun of teenage boys that do the same thing.  No, not the same thing.  Chuck Liddell wrestled, idiots.  We know that's stupid.  We're just making jokes.  We all were in that position in high school, and it was awkward to try the wrestling thing. 
[01:37:00]  I don't remember seeing anything in WWF or E that was like that.  Maybe a couple of things, but not that prolonged just laying on top of another man.  What about the great, what was his name, where his finishing move was to rub his big, huge, sweaty butt in your face?  That was funny.  That was funny because the guy having it done to him didn't sit there and take it. 
[01:37:30]  It was just like, you know, he was disgusted.  All right, we'll get Sam, our wrestling expert, in here.  He'll come up with some of the...  Sometimes Sam Robertson.  Some of the homoerotic finishing moves that the WWE has.  Okay?  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton, 877-212-ON-A.  We got...  What do we got, Jimmy?  We got Steve Coogan coming in in about 15 minutes.  Nice.  830, yeah.  He's...  Hamlet 2 and Tropic Thunder. 
[01:38:00]  Tropic Thunder.  He plays the director and really a funny part.  And he's a really famous character in England, Alan Partridge, which if you guys haven't seen that show,  if they would release the stupid DVDs on a format that fits American DVD players...  That would be nice.  I never saw that show.  Hilarious.  Now I'm going to go search that out, Jimmy.  Very cool.  There was something else.  Oh, yeah.  Finishing moves in the WWE.  And said they're not doing that right.  We're looking at the X-Pac Bronco Buster. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, the Bronco Buster.  Yeah.  All right.  That's pretty bad.  Can we get that up on ONA Radio?  All right.  ONA Radio.com for all the visuals we talk about on the radio show.  The Bronco Buster.  All right.  Really bad.  And it was Rashiki that did the butt thing.  Rikishi.  Rikishi.  I'm sorry.  That would rub his big, huge, sweaty butt in your face.  Yeah.  To humiliate you some more.  The stink face.  The stink face.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, Sam.  Any other weird ones in wrestling? 
[01:39:00]  Well, I mean, moves like the Power Bomb, where you've got to have a guy sitting on your  shoulders with his torso facing your face.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty bad.  Yeah.  And then the old tombstone pile driver where the head and the...  Is right.  Yeah.  The guy's head is upside down.  Yeah.  You're almost like 69 in position.  Sam, I want you to come up with the top five gayest wrestling finishing moves ever.  Okay.  For tomorrow's show with video, and we'll put it up on onaradio.com. 
[01:39:30]  But I will also add that these finishing moves, when pulled off, are very effective, too.  Of course they are.  Of course they are.  Hence the name.  Yeah.  We're wrapping up with sports and stuff.  It all started with this nine-year-old that no one wants to play against up there in New Haven.  JC, what's up?  Because he throws 40 miles an hour for a nine-year-old.  Yeah.  Hey, boys.  How are you?  Good.  Hey.  I play basketball for the youth league, and we played a team.  We lost 80 to 23. 
[01:40:00]  They had a kid that was 6'3 and could dunk.  He just ran up and down the field.  He's 6'3, he could dunk, and you're in the 13-year-old league.  Jeez.  All they would do.  It sucked.  This kid was on steroids.  This kid isn't the kid of being on steroids.  That's nice.  Well, why not?  Either that or he's 20.  Thanks, JC.  All right.  It's watching out.  All right.  Very good.  Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Yo.  What's up, boys? 
[01:40:30]  Hey.  Boy.  Dodge ball.  And they don't allow it in school anymore.  And I know that if I ever have kids, I want my kid to have the fun of having a rubber ball slammed in his face.  Don't you feel the same way, Anthony, when you have kids?  Of course.  Well, Anthony's not going to have kids.  I'm going to have kids.  But, yeah, dodge ball was a staple in school.  You know, you got to play that.  Jimmy, you okay?  You okay today, Jimmy?  Well, am I okay today?  My nose is very sore, but other than that, I'm okay. 
[01:41:00]  His nose is sore.  Oh, sweetie.  All right.  You guys have a great day.  Punching out.  Apparently, I have cancer of the funny bone.  Oh, no.  There's a cure for that, though.  Yeah.  Another day.  Yeah, I know.  You're fine.  Another day is the cure.  Wednesday is the cure.  Dave in Jersey.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  One more.  You're real.  Yep.  Well, I think I've got the most homoerotic wrestling story there is.  Okay.  I started wrestling early, like around age seven. 
[01:41:30]  And our coach taught us a move, and I kid you not, called the Saturday Night Ride.  It's originally called the double-leg grapevine.  Now, yeah, exactly.  Can we look up the double-leg grapevine or whatever to see if it's on YouTube?  Yeah, go ahead.  So, you got the guy who's pinning the other guy down, wraps one leg around one leg, wraps  his other leg around the other leg, spread the legs, and arch your back. 
[01:42:00]  That is the most homoerotic move in amateur life.  Wow.  That is a bad one.  I kid you not.  And we would laugh every time they said, it was Saturday Night Ride.  And we would all just laugh at it as we did it, because it was probably the most gayest  thing you ever saw.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him.  The guy's, like, pumping.  He's thrusting.  Exactly.  And that's really a move?  That's really a move.  You actually see that in wrestling. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  That is a dumbass move.  And Sam left out the most homoerotic finishing move in wrestling.  It's by a wrestler known as Norman Smiley, and I kid you not, it's called the Big Wiggle.  He takes his opponent, sends him over in front of him, gets behind him, and then he  puts his hand down his own front and starts playing like he's spanking the guy in front  of him on both sides. 
[01:43:00]  And he rides him, and he rides the guy around the ring.  And I'm sure you can get video on that.  Oh, I got it.  Look at that gay move.  Those are the two most gay moves in wrestling altogether.  Thank you, sir.  Good phone call.  Dave and Jersey.  Dave and Jersey.  All right, before we take a break and get to Steve Coogan, we have to talk about this  trunking.  Something else that's going on today.  Yeah, what is trunking?  You're not going to believe it.  Is it sex?  Uh, no.  No? 
[01:43:30]  No, no, no.  This is trunking.  Anyone with a heart for a dog will hate hearing this.  The latest low in dog fighting.  It's a shock.  It's called trunking.  I don't like the sound of that.  Trunking involves fighting, but the battles take place inside a car trunk.  New Jersey SPCA investigator Corporal Al Peterson has been investigating this newest  atrocity and details what few can imagine.  Two fighting dogs be put inside the back of a trunk.  Then Corporal Peterson says the battles take place in a dark parking lot, or perhaps the 
[01:44:00]  dogs are driven around by someone called the referee.  Music up loud so the battling animals aren't heard.  What the hell?  Where's the entertainment in that?  Just shoot people.  You can't watch.  You open up the trunk.  And whoever's dead, whichever dog is dead, loses.  And then you get a nice surprise.  Did your dog win or not?  As the music's blasting.  I bet it's not the Doobie Brothers. 
[01:44:30]  Might be, though.  What's happening at the Doobie Brothers?  That's true.  All right.  We'll give you that.  Let's not forget.  The referee will go in.  They'll check out and find out who's the winner, who's the loser.  The winner?  The dog left inside the trunk alive.  I think they should put those people in the trunk and let them fart it out.  Kevin Marshall knows about animal abuse.  As a puppy, his adopted pooch Ashley was found in the trash.  I think it's bad.  They should just let the animals go.  Animal advocates wonder what will humans think of next.  The newest way to be cruel is a crime. 
[01:45:00]  But the thrill of the kill has not stopped it from gaining popularity nationwide.  We know it's going on not only in New Jersey.  We found that it's going on in Chicago, Detroit, many urban and major cities.  Just say it.  Yeah.  Many urban cities.  Many urban cities.  What the hell's that? 
[01:45:30]  Reporter.  He's a reporter.  Oh, the reporter actually got in the trunk of a car to do the story?  We have a lot of videos for ownaradio.com.  This guy's doing a report.  Is that the audio we just heard?  I'm not sure.  Okay.  And the reporter started his piece inside a trunk sideways discussing this trunking thing  and then had the cameraman, I guess, just, you know, close the trunk door, so now he's  inside the trunk.  Oh, they're just the worst. 
[01:46:00]  Let's go to Matt in New Jersey.  Matt.  What's up, boys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey.  I used to wrestle, and when I was in high school, I got paired up in practice with a homosexual.  And he didn't come out of the closet until after the fact that, but we started off one  day, and he pinned me and kissed me on the lips and said, you're pinned.  I just freaked out.  I freaked out in front of the whole, you know, wrestling room and just started calling him 
[01:46:30]  all these bad names.  And he got kicked off the team right hand in there, but it was really, really weird.  And I also had another time where a friend of mine was getting pinned, and his father  ran on the mat and just pulled him right off the mat.  So he didn't have to get pinned.  That's an exciting story there.  That was pretty amazing stuff there.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  Scott in Jersey, what's up?  What's up, boys? 
[01:47:00]  Eight.  Hey, that has to be the worst reporter ever.  The dog who's alive wins.  Yeah, you think?  Yeah.  Well, maybe they flip it a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  The big surprise is that the dead dog wins.  Oh, yeah.  That would be the winner.  Yeah.  No, you're right.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Something tells me this isn't happening a lot.  What?  There's trunking?  Yeah.  This doesn't seem as entertaining.  You know, for people that are entertained by that, as the ring and, you know, the dogs 
[01:47:30]  and being able to watch.  Who would volunteer their car?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't the dogs just talk it over?  Go, look, no one's looking.  What are we doing?  When they open it up, let's just jump out and take off.  Or why don't you play dead?  Your turn to play dead.  Yeah.  I'll bite his hand.  We'll run.  Yeah.  Hose it out every night like Henry Hill had a hose out the back of his car.  Bury Billy Bats.  We hit a skunk.  Can anybody hear me?  I don't get this.  I'm like, I've never called this show. 
[01:48:00]  What's going on?  I don't get it.  Oh.  You don't get the show?  Can you actually hear me?  Yes, we can.  Yeah, Bridget.  Oh, my God.  That's so cool.  See, I don't know.  I'm listening to you guys.  Oh, yeah.  And about the wrestling thing.  I wanted to mention, when I saw that on the television for the first time and I was  watching with my guy friends, I had to literally think twice about them actually  being gay because the things that they were doing on the show that.  Steve Coogan has arrived.  We're going to take a quick break and we're going to get him on the radio next. 
[01:48:30]  Opie and Anthony.  It's an Opie and Anthony show entertainment news minute with Hollywood actor Michael Madsen.  What was the biggest piece of shit you were involved with?  This show.  Oh, damn.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:49:00]  We've got to get right back into this.  It's the Opie and Anthony show in studio.  Steve Coogan.  You might remember him from Tropic Thunder, a movie that's doing very, very well at the  box office right now.  Loved Tropic Thunder.  Thank you very much.  We saw an early screening of that and it was so good.  It's the first movie I've seen in, I can't even tell you how long, where I actually went  back a second time and saw it again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it stands.  It's going to do well on DVD though.  Yeah.  You play the director in Tropic Thunder.  Yes, I do.  And well, enough people have seen it. 
[01:49:30]  I mean, you get blown up in the movie and they're holding up your head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I stand on the line.  I make a big speech.  Part of the joke is that you figure I'm going to be one of the central characters and then  I stand on the landmine and literally blow up.  Yeah.  And then they just kind of start showing off your head.  I think Ben Stiller's like, look, this is a prop head.  And he puts his fingers inside the skull and now he's licking blood and like, look, this  is just prop blood.  And then Ben Stiller makes the faces like, oh, this is real. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  But that's got to be creepy to see your head like that.  Yeah.  They did a big cast of your head to try and that's to make a replica head.  They kind of, they swayed you in these sort of plaster of Paris bandages and you have to  breathe through straws stuck up your nose for 45 minutes.  That's got to be great though.  It was a comic though.  Just to know you're going to get killed in a movie, like finally something different  than just doing like, you know.  Oh, it's great.  It's a funny role.  And also if you're going to leave a movie, then you should go out literally with a bang,  which is what I do.  Because you're really not expecting it.  You're a, I'm a fan. 
[01:50:30]  I mean, my ex-girlfriend turned me on to, before she left me, turned me on to, I'm Alan Partridge.  Wow.  She has double good taste.  Very hurtful.  She's a, it's really, really a funny series, man.  Really funny series, but it doesn't, they have to put on DVD the format where it works  here because it doesn't seem to work here.  You have to buy a special, like the DVD player has to play like whatever format you guys use  in England.  I know they did, they did release, they released the, they released the second series on American 
[01:51:00]  Format recently.  But one of the series they have, but it's the BBC are kind of, you know, they're not the  most hyper-efficient of organizations.  It's so great though.  I mean, you play in it, it's like a, such an ass, Alan Partridge is.  It's such a great, I'd say that and, and, and Gervais and The Office are probably the  best portrayals of horses' asses I've ever seen.  That's great.  Yeah.  No, I think you're, I agree with you.  Ricky Gervais runs me a pretty close second.  Yeah.  Nice, I like that.  I like your attitude.  Wow, you're pretty serious.  I was told you were kind of wacky.  Oh, no, no. 
[01:51:30]  We're not wacky, that's for sure.  Wacky.  Waka waka.  You got it.  That was a good line by, uh, by Mr. Coogan.  We didn't know who was serious or not though.  No.  Well, you can't ever tell, you know, I'm kind of quite dry, especially at whatever time  it is.  Yeah.  So, uh, you got a great review in, uh, in Hamlet 2.  Uh, did you read this review in the, uh, the guy said, this is, this is like, it's, it's  like always a catch 22 and they give you a good review because the language just kind  of makes you want to smash their faces.  But it said, mostly though, there's the endlessly resourceful, endlessly inventive, bedazzling 
[01:52:00]  Mr. Coogan.  Ooh.  Okay.  Bedazzling.  Yeah.  And I didn't even, uh, I don't even know the guy.  I've never met him, you know, so.  All right.  Well, they really loved it.  That's pretty nice.  Yeah.  It was a hit at, uh, Sundance and they said it's, uh, never since, since Death of a Salesman,  uh, never has a failure been so entertaining.  But it was a great review of the film.  Yeah, no, they've been pretty kind to me.  I think, uh, it's kind of, it was, I just, it was a good, but it's a great script.  You know, Pam Brady wrote it, the Team America and South Park and, uh, uh, and so, you know, 
[01:52:30]  it's got that kind of level of humor and it's pretty close to the bone, pretty risque.  Um, and we got to ask the basic question.  So what's it about?  Yeah, exactly.  Hamlet 2.  I play, uh, a drama school teacher, a failed actor who's, uh, from, who's been in LA trying  to get work and goes to Tucson to become a drama teacher and, uh, in the back end of  beyond and, uh, they're going to close down the drama department and he decides to save 
[01:53:00]  it by writing a sequel to Hamlet.  Um, uh, in which, uh, Hamlet builds a time machine, goes back in time and saves everyone's  life and, uh, meets Jesus Christ along the way.  Um, and, uh, in the beginning of the movie, you sort of get a tone of what he's about  because he's putting on a stage production, uh, with the students, a stage production of  Erin Brockovich, uh, at the school.  So he's kind of, um, he's, that's where he's coming from.  He's sort of super earnest guy.  He thinks he's an inspirational teacher, you know, like, uh, he keeps quoting dead poet 
[01:53:30]  society and dangerous minds.  As, uh, saying, saying that that's, that's what he is, you know, and, uh, those films  are kind of like models for him.  So, uh, yeah.  And, uh, and he's, he's a horse's ass.  It satirizes inspirational teacher's movies, but, uh, kind of becomes one in the end as  well.  A Dangerous Mind with, uh, Michelle Pfeiffer, which she did the worst Southern accent.  She was like kind of in and out of her accent and it was, it was that Coolio song was the,  uh, the theme song.  Yeah, yeah.  That really sucked.  What a great movie to parody.  The bio they gave us on you, um, it's really weird, the information we get. 
[01:54:00]  They said he claims to have a, a bad temper and be an angry person in real life, but you  think it makes you funnier.  I mean, how, how true is that?  Like, do you try to keep the anger?  Uh, yeah.  Well, he's just, there's something about this kind of navel gazing.  You know, you get a lot of like, uh, those, those, those West Coast people who talk about  their emotions constantly.  And he's one of those guys.  No, I mean you.  Oh, me?  Yeah.  You're all.  I mean, you.  Personal question.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, do I channel?  Yeah, of course.  I mean, all the parts of me that are an ass, I channel into what I do. 
[01:54:30]  You might as well.  They're kind of useless qualities unless you kind of employ them in some way.  And so that's what I try to do, just to put them into the work.  But are you really an angry person in real life?  Um, I mean, no, I'm not, no, no, I'm not that, I don't have the energy, I guess, to  be, to be angry.  I just get, I'm just, I prefer to be someone who's rather than angry with life.  I'm just like kind of constantly slightly irritated by it.  Were you tired of doing Alan Partridge?  Are you sick and tired of that character?  I mean, after, I think it was 14 years or whatever it was?  Uh, well, kind of, but I've not done him for like six years. 
[01:55:00]  Uh, so, so, but then I'm going on the road in the fall in the UK doing sort of, doing  live comedy all around, all around the country.  And, uh, I'll be doing the character in that.  So I do like a bunch of characters on stage live and I'll be doing that like round kind  of, you know, arenas and live venues.  Well, you're massive in England.  It's a huge, huge show in, in, in England.  And, uh, have you found that it's kind of harder to be, uh, is the success here been  as easy to come by or, cause it seems like the shows take off there and then a couple  of years later they get replayed here and they do really well. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Uh, it's, well, it's, it's kind of, uh, uh, it's actually been quite good here because  I've kind of, in England, when you become successful, you get associated with the thing  that made you, that made you a success.  And, uh, that can be kind of like a double-edged sword because it stops you being able to break  out of it and do other stuff and have preconceived notions of you.  Um, but then, uh, but, but over here, uh, a lot of directors and, uh, actors are kind  of, um, wanting to work me in a different way.  And I, I write a lot of my stuff and I'm collaborating with people. 
[01:56:00]  I'm doing some, I'm doing a series for HBO with Justin Theroux who wrote Tropic Thunder.  So, uh, I've got a lot of stuff, uh, that's, that's kind of, uh, is different from  what I've, I'm established, uh, uh, doing in the UK.  So it's kind of, so it's actually my anonymity here that, uh, I had sort of, uh, uh, for  quite a while, uh, it's kind of enabled me to do different stuff.  Can you do an American accent?  I do one in Hamlet too.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is it tough?  Uh, yeah, but I got a coach, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I always see that in the credits.  But I'm not going to audition for you right here.  No, no.  Go see the movie.  That's why I'm here.  I wasn't even going to ask, you know, I was just wondering, uh, how difficult that is.  And I always see on the credits, you know, vocal coach and, uh, accent coach, whatever  it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, uh, I think Anthony really wanted to hear the American accent.  No, no, I'm fine.  I'll wait till the movie.  I'll watch, I'll see the movie.  Cause it always amazes me.  A lot of times you see guys in movies and girls in movies and you watch the movie and don't  think twice about it.  And then you see them in an interview and they're like, you know, it was a wonderful experience. 
[01:57:00]  What happened?  A couple of the guys from the wire, from the HBO show.  Wow.  Yeah.  Dominic.  Totally different in real life.  Deep English accents.  Yeah.  Uh, Gary Oldman.  I never would have known he was, he was British if I didn't hear him talking in an interview.  He always playing, you know.  Yeah.  He always plays American.  That's right.  Yeah.  Some creepy drugged out American cop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a tenant with a bad Coke habit.  He's like, right.  Bensonhurst somewhere.  And then you hear him.  He's a polite, he's a polite, uh, English gentleman.  English gentleman.  Yes.  Sure.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, going back to Tropic Thunder, what do you think of the special interest groups 
[01:57:30]  having a problem with, uh, uh, well, I think, uh, I think all comedy is, uh, you know, you  have to sail close to the wind and, and it's, uh, being, having edgy comedy is about being  risque and, uh, the, the target is not, you know, the target of the, that, that comedy  is quite clearly pretentious, um, sort of award-seeking, egotistical American actors.  Right.  Uh, who kind of, in some ways, exploit those people to get the awards.  Uh, that, that, that was the kind of target of the joke.  That's the satire. 
[01:58:00]  Um, so.  But with that, they, they yanked down a lot of the, uh, promotional material for the movie  because it, it featured, uh, the Simple Jack character that Ben Stiller played.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which was so disappointing.  It's like, why do they cater to these people?  Why do they fold?  Uh, well, I think they could, it's not, it's not a case of, because, because you have to  counter the argument, uh, rather than just run away.  If you just run away and keep quiet, that's like almost a mission of guilt.  And I think it's not.  I think the movie's totally defendable, so.  Are they as bad over there about the humor?  Because we've become, Americans have become really hypersensitive. 
[01:58:30]  Uh, I know in England, I think there's certain racial things that are probably, like, with  Muslims, and, I mean, that's kind of like probably the way black-white is here.  Yeah.  What are, like, the real sacred cows over there that they, they really cry if you go after?  Uh, I think they, they're actually not that bothered about religion per se.  Um, they tried to make it an offense to, or to them, they tried to make blasphemy an offense.  At one point, the government were going to introduce some law whereby you couldn't offend  anyone's religion, which would have sort of ended the careers of probably 70% of, uh, comedians 
[01:59:00]  in Britain.  You know, um, sacred cows, I guess the kind of, uh, uh, Muslim thing people are super paranoid  about, you know, because of, uh, race relations in Britain.  There's a little bit of that.  But, um, but, but, but, but, and I have to say, I mean, you say that Americans kind of,  maybe you think they're more conservative, but you look at something like South Park,  uh, they, I, they pretty much go after absolutely.  Yeah, but Jimmy brought this to our attention a while ago.  If you're a cartoon, you could get away with a hell of a lot more than, let's say, this radio show. 
[01:59:30]  Very good point.  Especially a big money-making cartoon, you know, they, uh, they flew under the radar for  a while and got very popular and it's hard for a network, especially like Comedy Central  to take on such a successful show.  So they get away with it.  That's very true.  Very true.  And it can be explained, no matter how heinous their episodes are, and I love them, that  they do try to do, uh, it's done in satire.  It's done in satire.  It's also not mean-spirited. 
[02:00:00]  That's the other thing is where the comedy comes from.  If the comedy seems to be peddling hate or it's mean-  Yeah, yeah, then there's a problem.  Then it's illegitimate, but they always come around and do something.  Mm-hmm.  And also, I think the, the, the South Park is a good example.  I think human, you can do it in, if you create a character that's very strong, you can kind  of get away with murder.  And I have done that in Britain with Alan Partridge.  He might say something which is offensive to women or offensive to some special interest  group.  And the joke is that he's, uh, he doesn't realize it's being offensive.  The fact that it's offensive is the point of the joke. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  So there, there's a way of doing it, but you need to establish, uh, some people just  don't get that.  Like you're goofing on the character that's saying this because it's so preposterous that  no one in their right mind that lives in a society, a civilized society would say this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And that's where the joke is.  But you get people that just don't get it and they just see it on the outside and go,  oh, wow, he's saying something racist or sexist.  Like you say, there's certain things you're just not allowed to speak about.  And that's just, that's just dumb.  In some ways it kind of like, that makes people, it encourages fear and people not talk 
[02:01:00]  about kind of issues.  Yeah.  Sometimes if you, if you address kind of, you know, like a latent racism, uh, that, that  is the kind of sort of the, that, the, not, not the out and out, out racism, but the  kind of subtle kind of understated racism.  And you put that into comedy, it's a way of airing it and people can go, oh yeah, I've  seen that.  Oh yeah.  Maybe sometimes, uh, you know, that, that we're all guilty of that kind of, uh, you know,  racism.  So I think it's, it's, uh, it, you know, you can use it in a, in a comedy can be used 
[02:01:30]  in a very positive way.  The subtler side of racism, like the little, the little stuff, like a lot of times like,  and I caught myself doing this, like if black people are walking towards my car, I'll  like slam all the locks down and scream and run a red light.  Okay.  That is subtle.  That's better safe than sorry.  No, that's very subtle.  Comedy, for some reason, you can't get away with things you can get away with in other  things like drama.  Uh, you can get away with, um, portraying blatant hate and racism as part of a character, as part 
[02:02:00]  of a storyline.  But comedy for some reason is really, um, they, they look a little deeper into it and  they, I don't understand why.  I don't understand why that, uh, that is either.  I think it's cause I think maybe what it is is people understand that laughter is incredibly  powerful.  And if you can get someone, if you want to make a point and you get people laughing, it's  kind of like whatever the point you're making is, uh, you've kind of won the argument.  You know, it's, it's, uh, it's a really powerful thing. 
[02:02:30]  If you make a, you know, you get people laughing about, I mean, even in politics, like the election  right now, if you, if you make, uh, some, if you make a kind of a joke about your opponent  opponent and get people laughing at that joke, it's incredibly empowering.  It's sort of, it shows that you're the guy who makes the joke is the guy in control and  everyone else is laughing.  I remember, uh, God, Hitler having him just screaming and howling at Nuremberg.  Oh, did he have them laughing?  Yeah, they were rolling in the aisles.  I bet you, as we think about Hitler though, there's gotta be times where Hitler tried jokes 
[02:03:00]  that didn't work.  Oh, I'm bombing.  He probably tried to go off the cuff once in a while.  Do you know what?  I, I, I kind of doubt it with, uh, kind of doubted.  I don't know.  That's a, that's a, it could be a German thing.  I'll get accused of xenophobia now by saying that Germans aren't absolutely hilarious.  And I think they are, but not maybe in the way they intended to be.  Boy, that grudge is still there, isn't it?  English, German, uh, little grudge.  Well, funnily enough, the English used to get on very well with the Germans before the 
[02:03:30]  Second World War.  It was the French we traditionally didn't like.  Right.  Um, I think it's kind of, I think we've kind of, we've kind of found our way back into  that niche recently with the French.  It's good to hear.  Yeah, the French has always been the people who were traditionally mistrusted and the French  mistrusted us and I think our food and behavior is odd and we think their, uh, sense of humor  and, uh.  And sexuality.  And, yeah.  Bathing habits and military history.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[02:04:00]  You, uh, in, in, uh, 2006, there was a big, you know, rumor that you and Courtney love.  I mean, you know, I got to ask about it because it's, it's kind of hot if you were hooking  up with her.  Uh, well, I, uh, the only thing I have to say is, uh, uh, whatever she said about me  online, um, uh, well, first of all, don't believe everything you read online.  And also, if, if, if you're quoting her, I have to say that.  No, no, I'm not.  I actually don't, I don't know where.  Oh, really?  Oh, I don't know what she said.  Oh, really?  Um, I would just say, uh, anyone who does read anything online that comes from, I'd say  that if, if you're interested in sort of, uh, the veracity of a story, you're supposed 
[02:04:30]  to check the credibility of the source.  Okay?  You get what I'm saying?  Check the credibility of the source of the story.  Um, uh, beyond that, I've, uh, I've, I've really nothing to say because, um, if I do,  uh, then I'll sort of, I'll, I'll open the floodgates to a soap opera that may be entertaining  to other people, but deeply dull to me.  Well, what is this?  Okay.  Can you say, cause I didn't read it.  Was she badmouthing you?  Because now the way you're saying that, it sounds like she might have badmouthing you.  Well, uh, I didn't hear.  Well, um, if I, if I, uh, we're going to go around circles here cause I'm just saying that 
[02:05:00]  I'm not going to say anything else about it and you're asking me a question about it.  So by the way, this is the wacky part.  Yeah, no, it's good.  I can feel the joy and the cold sweat, uh, simultaneously, uh, happening beneath my  clothes.  Um, so, uh, so where were we?  So that's it.  That's it.  You know?  Um, all right.  Um, that's a no comment.  That's a no comment.  That is a, yeah.  Well, I, I'm only asking cause I really, this is all I have on.  Jimmy! 
[02:05:30]  No, no, no.  I'm not even asking.  Go on.  It just says, uh, that, that they filed a two week long fling apparently and that was  it.  Although this claim has been dismissed by both parties.  That's all.  I didn't agree that she had written anything bad.  So when you said that, of course.  Right.  If that was the nicest thing that had happened, I'd be, I'd be, I'd be full of the joys of  spring.  Let me ask you a hypothetical question.  If you ever had sex with a girl who was known to be whacked out and did a lot of drugs  and she bad mouthed you, would you still want to have sex with her?  Um, hypothetically, probably not. 
[02:06:00]  Hmm.  Okay.  This is going really well.  This is going so well.  We're just kind of chatting.  I didn't realize that was such a, it's obviously a, all those personal things are silly.  Well, look, the British tabloids are notoriously worse than they are here.  I mean, and they've been kind of, I guess.  Aside from you.  Well, that's why I'm not.  I'm teasing, Jimmy.  I like him.  Jimmy, I love him.  That's, that's a great thing, having your cake and eating it.  It's like, it must be terrible when you, when, oh, then it's just like, what?  You know what?  The worst, the worst thing, a way of saying, you're an asshole. 
[02:06:30]  Does it hurt when people say that?  You're a jerk.  Does it hurt when people say that?  Well, there's no, but the thing is, is I'm a comic.  Look, my life's an open book.  I mean, I've died hookers the whole nine yards.  So to me, none of it's a big, big deal.  I mean, especially if it's been brought out in the press.  Um, none of it, it's all to me.  It's just silly.  But, uh, you know, I asked about it.  But now it's uncomfortable for everybody involved.  Let's talk about Elizabeth Shue, who, uh, she's in the movie.  And, uh, how good was her ass in, uh, Leaving Las Vegas?  How sexy was that scene? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, she looked very good in that.  Great, yeah.  You don't remember her, no?  Oh, yeah, of course I do.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  It was fantastic, yeah.  And she dropped some weight.  She had a little baby fat on her before that.  I think she looked good in Leaving Las Vegas.  Yeah, she did.  She looked pretty good in Hamlet 2 as well.  All right, now we're all uncomfortable, and it's kind of,  Awkward.  No, not at all, Jimmy.  I wasn't trying to be awkward.  I was just asking.  She was great.  I made out with her.  It was fun.  Um, uh, on screen, not off screen.  Um, there was no drugs involved. 
[02:07:30]  Uh, and, uh, we had a good time, and she was funny,  and she made fun of herself.  She plays herself in the movie.  And, um, that was all, that was all jolly, jolly good.  What about, uh, what is the worst rumor that the British tabloids have gotten a hold of  and ran with that just absolutely wasn't true?  That, that, what was the thing that made you the angriest?  Um, that I, uh, picked my nose.  You know, that was the thing that made me the angriest.  Yeah.  They have a picture? 
[02:08:00]  Yes, they did.  Were you just scratching?  I was just scratching, and I was picking it, and that's...  A booger-eating nose picker, and...  But everyone picks their nose, though.  Yeah, exactly.  So it's a big deal.  But it was kind of, they caught me doing it in a car in L.A., actually.  Wow.  Digging deep.  Yeah, they just sort of wired the picture back.  So that, that made me angry.  Mm-hmm.  Well, as long as I don't accuse you of eating it, picking is one thing.  Eating is a totally different story.  Yeah, it is, yeah.  I like the, uh, British, uh, tabloids because of the, um, the nude, uh, pictures.  That's kind of, like, it's kind of a cool thing that they got there. 
[02:08:30]  And you don't mind, like, breasts on TV every so often.  That's true, yeah, we're pretty, uh...  And we're all stuck.  We're just such a, ugh, when it comes to that.  God forbid.  They could show, they could show dead bodies on the news, uh, when the children are home  from school, uh, but a breast, for some reason, is just gonna, gonna wipe out the face of the  earth.  Wipe out civilization.  Yeah.  I know the body count can be as high as you like, um, on TV, but you can't show a breast.  Um, and don't get me wrong, I love violence. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, do I love violence on television.  Yes, but it's nice to balance it with a bit of sex.  Exactly.  You gotta be able to balance it with sex.  I mean, what are people primarily looking at on the internet?  They go well together, like, you know, egg and bacon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sex, violence.  Mm.  Mm.  Just ask our own, uh...  What, we gotta go?  Yeah, it's time to go.  I was just saying it, Pat Duffy.  Loves that sex and violence stuff.  I'm sorry, I got awkward and uncomfortable.  I like this.  I'm gonna just let it just...  Awkward and uncomfortable?  A little bit, yeah.  I've been having a grand time. 
[02:09:30]  No, but I can tell he's a little.  He thinks that we were kind of, uh, out to ask him, uh, but it's just not the truth.  I ask for the British tabloids because I, they just, they're notoriously awful.  You know?  Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of them, but, uh, you know, they sell tickets for me, so I, I, I'm,  well, I'm not too, I'm so unhappy.  Obviously, it's a sensitive subject that, uh, we didn't know.  Uh, we could say that much.  We didn't know we were, you know...  All right, drop it.  Is it a Cove 22, though?  Is it, like, a love-hate relationship with them?  Because as, as revolting as they are, they do, again, they keep you in the spotlight. 
[02:10:00]  I think the paparazzi here...  Well, not so great, because I don't think, you know, I think it depends what you're saying.  Like, the paparazzi, like, uh, might put people in the spotlight, but it doesn't help  you actually get more people into, to, into the theaters.  That, that's more about reviews and stuff like that.  People don't look at people in People magazine and go, wow, they're, they're, they're walking  out with that, they're stepping out with that girl, I'm gonna go see their movie.  It doesn't work like that.  So, by and large, no.  I mean, uh, no, it's, I, I kind of, I think that the, kind of tabloids, uh, the, uh, kind 
[02:10:30]  of evil incarnate, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, kind of evil incarnate, yeah.  All right, there you go.  Steve Coogan, Hamlet 2, uh, opens wide this Friday, right?  Yes, it does.  Yeah, it's in theaters now in select places here, maybe Los Angeles.  A couple of the major cities, but Friday, you can see it everywhere.  It is getting as really good as it is.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We're heading over to XM Satellite Radio.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Great.  I love you, man.  I love you, man. 
[02:11:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I love you.  I love you.  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you. 
[02:12:30]  Thank you. 
[02:13:00]  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  Now the fun begins.  It's Opie and Anthony on Sirius XM Radio. 
[02:14:30]  Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Wow.  I love the first appearance of tabloid Jimmy.  He sure made one hell of an impression on Coogan.  What did Coogan say?  As soon as the mics went off, I enjoyed the banter.  Yeah.  Enjoyed the banter.  Well, we got to explain what happened.  Well, we got to explain what happened.  I guess I heard that Mr. Coogan might have had a bit of a panic attack live on our show today.  Well, talking to Jimmy will do that. 
[02:15:00]  And Jimmy...  Tabloid Jimmy.  Tabloid Jimmy.  On the case.  I'm really in a fucking horrible mood right now.  And I'll tell you why.  During the interview, because I'm a fan.  I like Steve Coogan.  Before he came in, he was friends with Owen Wilson.  Really close friends.  And there were rumors circulating that he had been involved with getting Owen drugs.  There was just all these rumors that had circulated.  Rumor and speculation.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That Owen Wilson's problems might have started with Steve Coogan. 
[02:15:30]  Right.  Or have been helped by him.  Or...  Exactly.  And I can understand why he wouldn't want to go into that.  A, because it's his friend.  And B, for legal reasons.  Could be some legal ramifications.  To me, that's not even a cunty avoid the subject thing.  That's one of the ones you'd have to...  You know, you got to kind of avoid.  Right.  Fair enough.  So I had no problem with that.  And he rarely does interview Steve Coogan, by the way, because of that.  He doesn't want to deal with that.  Well, now he won't do anything.  No, but this is why I'm really, really irritated, because I would have avoided that.  Because, and again, I like the guy. 
[02:16:00]  It's not about getting him in here and douching him.  So on the prep, we all get prep sheets.  And I read the emails last night, and it was mentioned, the whole tie-in with Owen Wilson.  And on the prep sheet, it says, we have a bunch of information.  We get one of these beforehand.  A little bit about Hamlet, too.  A little bit about his life, claiming to have a bad temper, an angry person.  And here's what I have about Courtney Love.  In August 2005, the News of the World stated that rock star Courtney Love had claimed to be pregnant with Coogan's child, following a two-week-long fling the pair allegedly had while staying at the same hotel, although this claim has been dismissed by both parties. 
[02:16:30]  That's what I have on Courtney Love.  Seems kind of innocent.  Eh, you know, did he, you know, she's a rock star.  Did he bang her?  Did he not bang her?  So that's why you went and asked him about Courtney Love, basically.  But now...  Nothing about the drug thing.  No, I didn't realize it was...  This is all just, you wanted to know if he fucked Courtney Love and how it wasn't.  And I'm annoyed at the prep sheet, but I'm also annoyed at myself that I didn't know this. 
[02:17:00]  Because it just stopped him in his tracks.  Oh, yeah.  But that's why I said I'm a comic.  My life is open.  I've gotten hooked.  I couldn't understand why it would be a big deal.  Well, did you hook up with Courtney or didn't you?  I thought that's what they had denied.  Maybe they were friends.  It had been speculated that they had sex, and they did.  Whatever it was.  So now I get this sheet.  I asked for more information, obviously, because I asked Roland afterwards.  I'm like, why did he get mad about that?  He goes, well, that was a tie-in to Owen Wilson. 
[02:17:30]  But who knew?  I should have.  And I'm fucking...  I'm just annoyed I didn't do my homework.  And if we're going to get a prep sheet, and she's going to be mentioned, I just kind  of wish that that had been on the sheet.  Even in parentheses, you might...  Whatever.  This is what I have.  This is offline.  I don't know where Sam got this.  Wilson's drug use was so frequent, it was even the cause of his moment.  Memorial Day breakup with Kate Hudson.  And his friends are placing the blame squarely on Wilson's newfound best buddy, British actor  Steve Coogan.  And this is what...  I went through it with Steve Coogan's former girlfriend, rocker Courtney Love told us. 
[02:18:00]  Oops.  I was just at a rehab, and he was right there with the drugs.  I tried to warn Owen.  I tried to warn his friends.  I hope from the bottom of my heart that Owen stays the hell away from that guy.  Wow.  Okay, so...  That's why when I said, well, what did she say?  He just panicked.  He was like, I'm not answering another question.  That's what that was about.  So he wasn't being a douchebag, but I was getting angry at myself.  I'm like, why is he being a dick when I'm really not...  There are two Courtney Love stories here. 
[02:18:30]  One is the story of him having sex with her for two weeks, the pregnancy, that.  And then the other one is this Owen Wilson drug thing.  He must have thought you meant that.  Of course he did.  Of course he did.  And that's why I was kind of, I was just whatever.  So I'm not, look, I'm just annoyed.  I'm annoyed the way it was put on the prep sheet, and I'm also annoyed at myself.  And by the way, continuing with the Owen Wilson thing, Kate Hudson banned Coogan from 
[02:19:00]  Wilson's house while they were dating.  She knew he was bad, so to speak.  Wow.  And look.  Seems so gentlemanly.  The bottom line is this.  Any type of accusation is like, hey, you're fucking, you're coming to America, you want  to make films and all that stuff, and he's one of the biggest stars in the country, Owen  Wilson.  Yeah.  And then you're accused of fucking giving him drugs that make him almost kill him.  You know, that could be a bad thing.  It could be.  To have on your head.  So you probably want to avoid that, and that's fine. 
[02:19:30]  But I'm just, I'm really annoyed that the pregnancy thing.  Cancel all my fucking interviews.  Yeah, you're not going to hear from him anytime soon.  Yeah.  He, his face, like just, he was in a panic mode, it looked like.  Yeah.  A little bit of a panic attack.  Yeah.  Steven S. from Bayshore, I love the faithful listeners that understand this show in and  out.  Line of the day was opening the exit theme seven minutes early.  Yeah, I noticed that, too.  Fan-fucking-tastic, sir.  I'm glad you did that.  And everyone's looking like, wow, the show's over?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:20:00]  We had so much time left.  I could feel myself getting so aggravated.  I should have let it go, to be honest with you.  But I was also getting aggravated at myself, because, like, I wasn't, and I'm actually  glad in hindsight I didn't, because now I know what it was about.  Yeah.  But I was like, you have to be attacking this person.  Why is he, like, I should be attacking this person for not, and I'm glad, again, I'm really  glad I didn't.  I didn't know the Courtney Love slash Owen Wilson tie-in myself.  I don't follow that shit. 
[02:20:30]  So they asked an innocent question about the tabloids.  What's the worst rumor they ever made up?  Like, you know, all right, let's just shit on them for a little bit.  That's all that was about.  Right after the show, I apologized to Jimmy.  I'm like, Jimmy, I'm kind of out of it today.  I wish I was there with you, because I would have went.  I basically told Jimmy I would have went after him, too, because it was such a weird, like,  just answer the dumb question.  Who cares?  But now that you have more info, then you understand where he was in this whole thing.  Yeah.  And I mean...  Especially because, I don't know.  I mean, we got to play the game a little differently these days, and when someone goes, 
[02:21:00]  look, you get Steve Coogan on the show, but you really, he would appreciate it if you  didn't mention Owen Wilson.  We kind of gave our word, and we were pretty good with our word.  And I didn't mind not mentioning it, because of the obvious reasons.  Yeah, he's not going to want to talk about something that could get him in trouble legally.  Yeah, that's not a celebrity being a pussy.  That's just common sense.  So, whatever.  I was really mad at myself, and I'm just annoyed that it seems so innocent.  Don't beat yourself up, sweetie. 
[02:21:30]  But I also, on the other side, don't want a guy who I like, just as a performer, to think  that I fucking brought him in like some fucking cunty radio guy to go, oh, let's ask the  big question.  Yeah.  And just know you're not going to get an answer and just try to fuck with a guy.  That also irritates me.  I like when we lead some of these guys to the slaughterhouse.  I'm Ted the Uncomfortable Interview Guy.  I just wish I would have known.  I'm Ted, and I don't know what I'm doing.  I should just get my picture taken and stop trying to be an equal. 
[02:22:00]  You did get your picture and autograph, though.  Yes, you did.  What a ballsy move.  I didn't care.  Get him all sweating.  I got to see that picture of you shaking and sweating.  What did he say after the show?  He ran out of the studio.  I still didn't know by that point.  I didn't really get to say goodbye to the guy.  I still didn't know by that point.  Right.  So, I said to him when he walked out, I'm like, dude, I wasn't trying to sandbag you.  I thought maybe something weird happened in a relationship with Courtney Love.  So, that's all that was about.  I'm like, I wasn't trying to sandbag you.  He was just really quiet.  He didn't say anything dicky.  He signed the DVD. 
[02:22:30]  He was cool about it.  Too asshole.  No, no.  He wasn't a dick.  He was fine.  But I think on some level, he probably knows that it wasn't intentional.  At least I hope it was.  Yeah.  If it was intentional, I would have fucking been a prick about it.  Yeah.  I was like, why is this uncomfortable?  I couldn't get why it was.  Well, there you have it.  Now we can.  They've said some bad things about Mr. Coogan.  Yeah.  Which is, again, for anyone in Hollywood to blame anyone else for them partying is fucking ludicrous.  Sure.  Anybody who's partying, and I'm, you know, as me as a recovering addict, you know, you  get partying because you want to party. 
[02:23:00]  That's it.  I'm also mad, Jimmy.  I'm mad that I started the Rage music.  Nah, well.  Right when it was getting really good.  Oh, I am so, I couldn't have been happier.  When that music kicked in, I was like, thank you, Jesus.  I really was debating in my head.  It was like the devil and the angel were on my shoulders.  I'm like, do I hit it?  Oh, this is good.  No, don't hit this.  I, um, because he was having a good time before that.  He's, you know, he's, again, he's like, whatever, but he was having a, he seemed to be enjoying  himself. 
[02:23:30]  But that, uh, I could just see the vibe completely change and get completely uncomfortable.  Yeah, man.  Hey, by the way, we got people, uh, you know, cause you're, you're good at the interview,  Jimmy.  Tim H from Columbus.  I'm not good at the interview.  I suck.  Well, that's where I'm getting at.  Tim H from Columbus, Ohio writes, Jimmy's interview with Eric Clapton.  So Eric, how's your son doing these days?  Oh, oh no.  Dude.  I did that with Gene Simmons the first time he was in.  I'm like, so how is Star Stowe?  And you laughed cause you thought I was, cause the name was so weird.  You thought I was joking.  Yeah.  Star Stowe was a, was a playboy playmate, very sexy, who he did a chopper photos shoot 
[02:24:00]  with me.  It was a really famous Gene Simmons shoot, you know, for Kiss fans.  And then there was rumors that they were having sex and she was so hot.  And, uh, well you laughed when I said, how is Star Stowe?  Cause you didn't know like, well, no, she was a person.  And then he goes, that's not funny.  She died.  So I asked the question, meaning it sincerely.  Yeah.  Cause you said to me, how come you're not asking Gene any questions?  Open laughs.  Laughs.  Thinks I'm kidding.  Gene thinks that we're laughing at the girl. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  It's like, I am just, I should.  Fuck her.  Can we get that?  I don't have a best friend.  Nah, who cares?  Dude, I don't even remember this.  Gene Simmons is a douche.  Can we try to find that?  One of the guys, could they find that?  Cause now I got to hear that.  Well, he talked about her, but it was just a laugh.  Cause he goes, well, that's not funny.  Right.  I don't remember.  I do vividly.  I think I was laughing cause that's all you had for your hero.  You're probably right.  And, and he thought, okay, now I get it.  And he thought I was laughing cause you know, we're sick fucks.  Uh, Chris Rabb writes, wow, Jim, you're having an odd day.  Good luck, bro. 
[02:25:00]  Love you, man.  Get Greg out of the studio.  Yeah.  I really should have.  Just sit there.  Cause you're honestly, and again, he kind of, I gotta be honest.  He kind of scared me, that guy.  Alan?  I mean, I was scary about him.  I don't know.  Did you think he was going to give you drugs?  Yeah.  Dude, he's funny, man.  I got a weakness.  His fucking show is funny.  Yeah.  Funny, man.  It's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  Alan Partridge show.  It's hilarious.  There was something about his eyes.  Then he must be a good actor.  There was something about his eyes that kind of scared me. 
[02:25:30]  Very dry.  Yeah.  There's some like, there's some anger in those eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's something going on in those eyes.  That dry English thing.  Mm-hmm.  Some people can transcend it.  Yeah.  Others, they just, wow.  Stay on that dry thing.  You kind of, you can't interview them.  It's very hard.  It's like pulling teeth, as they say.  Well, again, sometimes.  Or knocking them down their throat like Jimmy does.  John intentional.  Jimmy, I know.  I'm just teasing with you.  I would almost, if it was, that would be fine, but I hate, I hate that I was unprepared 
[02:26:00]  for something.  I didn't know something.  I'm just, it's a fucking...  Why should you hate that on this day, as opposed to every day we're in here?  John Thompson from New York writes, you realize you're insulting a fucking genius.  He had nothing to do with Owen Wilson being a faggot.  We don't know if Owen Wilson was a faggot.  I think Owen Wilson's gay.  I don't think he's gay.  He's always with chicks.  Mm-hmm.  I just, you know what it was?  It was that Philippe Petit, whatever the fuck his name is.  Philippe Petit.  Afterwards, I was annoyed at myself because I liked the guy, and I'm just, I'm kind of 
[02:26:30]  annoyed at myself because I give my, I give people I like way too much leeway.  In this case, it was, I'm glad it happened that way because I would have felt like a  complete cunt afterwards if I had gone after a guy and that's what it was about.  I would have felt like a total jerk-off.  So who do we blame for the prep sheet?  Sam made it up.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Oh, primetime.  He did an email mention that.  So it's not like he didn't mention, it did mention an email.  Now the prep sheet, that last part of the prep sheet was, was, was fucking stupid, but 
[02:27:00]  he did send it an email.  So I'm not going to say he didn't because he did.  Um, I didn't realize it was a link.  I should have checked it.  Oops.  Yeah, but again.  I blame primetime Sam Roberts.  For the prep sheet, whoever wrote it, he wrote it up.  It was shit.  Primetime.  The last one.  But the email was, was handled properly and that's my fault.  Primetime.  Primetime.  And me being the one talking on the air, it's ultimately my responsibility to fucking  know that.  Mm.  Um, you know, can you picture fucking Charlie Rose not knowing that?  And no, I don't want to be Charlie Rose, you fucking cunts on message boards.  I'm only saying that anyone, anytime you're talking to somebody. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  You should know what you're talking about.  And I'm aggravated that I didn't.  Well, I think, uh, probably right there today blew your chance for the Edward R.  Murrow award.  Yeah.  Uh, I don't think you're getting it this year.  Edward fucking R.  Norton award.  Fucking belong where I belong.  Bunch of fucking liquid shit and sewage floating by.  I, uh, I'm just annoyed.  There was a weird vibe with him as soon as he came in.  Yeah, maybe.  He seemed a little uncomfortable.  We've been, uh, rocking with the interviews lately.  That one was just a weird one. 
[02:28:00]  That was our first weird one in a while.  But, but he was laughing and getting, like, it seemed like he probably expected a morning  zoo crew.  Yeah, that's what I think he did expect.  Well, who said that we were wacky?  Someone might have told him that's a wacky show.  We were kind of, we were kind of just talking, getting into it.  And then he's probably like, all right, what's the vibe here?  And there's guys walking in, taking pictures.  It's a weird atmosphere to walk into.  It's not like when you do an interview and it's just one guy and you.  Yeah.  When you walk in with a, you know, what you would think would be a morning zoo, because you  don't know.  And there's a bunch of guys just kind of seriously asking questions. 
[02:28:30]  Yes.  Yes, sir.  Yay.  Fix it out a little bit.  Yeah.  I was really irritated.  And I know, because I've been in different radio shows and been interviewed, so I know  what's comfortable and what's not.  So I wouldn't fucking, whatever.  That was not?  No, it was very uncomfortable.  But I'm annoyed that I fucking, like, with that French fucking tightroper, he was being  cunty about, we didn't know his name or whatever, and I should have hit him for being cunty.  But I honestly didn't recognize him.  I'm like, oh, it's just who he is.  Then afterwards, I'm like, oh, yeah, he was being a douche. 
[02:29:00]  The Philip Petit.  And I should have fucking addressed that.  I'm not afraid to have confrontation.  I've had confrontation with people.  It's not about that.  You've seen it before.  I love confrontation.  You've seen it before.  I live for confrontation.  I tend to be more confrontational with fucking larger people who I think are trying to fucking  alpha male me.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm just really, I'm just whatever, man.  Fucking disgusted with myself.  But how do you really feel, Jimmy?  I'm not really sure.  Disgusted with myself.  Don't beat yourself up.  Disgusted with myself.  You do.  You bring your A game once a month to this show. 
[02:29:30]  And every day, every day, and then something happens in one interview because of a mix  up in paperwork, and you're going to beat yourself up.  I won't allow it, young man.  I won't allow it.  This just made it look like the two, like, because I was having internet trouble anyway  yesterday, which again, had nothing to do with me not reading that email or not going  to a link.  Weren't you voted best interviewing boy?  I was, but it was between me and a guy whose voice box had been torn out by a pit bull. 
[02:30:00]  So he would just sign questions to people who didn't speak then.  Hey, what were those emails we got?  Did they say that Courtney had accused him of being responsible for Owen Wilson's?  I would assume that would have been in the thing.  I didn't open the link.  I don't have any sense again.  Moron Steve Coogan.  Moron?  Don't call him a moron.  Wait, wait.  Went through enough today.  Promoting Hamlet 2, Hamlet 2, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:30:30]  Alan Partridge, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Interesting email.  Blah, blah, blah.  Oh, you're looking at the email.  Okay, good.  I'm getting there.  Hold on.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Angst, angry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Think he's got that temper thing?  Here we go.  Yep.  Oh, boy.  Maybe you should have read the email last night.  Oh, jeez.  I just glanced at it.  Oh, jeepers.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez, Margie.  In August 2005, the News of the World stated that rock star Courtney Love had claimed to 
[02:31:00]  be pregnant with Coogan's child following a two-week-long fling the pair allegedly had  while staying at the same hotel, although this claim has been dismissed by both parties.  Now, that was on the prep sheet.  Yes.  Then the next Sam Roberts sent an email literally a minute later.  Roland has said bringing this up would be a bad idea because he's seen other interviews  go bad.  And he says, Coogan will just deny it as not true and close off, but I should at least  mention it.  When the Luke Wilson suicide thing came out, people said his drug use was because he started 
[02:31:30]  hanging out with Steve Coogan.  Here's the link.  So I read that.  That's what I read.  Again, Roland really advises not to talk about it.  Hence, it's not on the one sheet, but there it is.  So I do believe Sam thinks that's two different stories.  Yes.  That's to me.  That's how I read that.  Because he put the Courtney Love in like, that's OK, but this isn't the Owen Wilson  thing.  Right.  So if I didn't go to the links, I read the emails.  I mean, I'm actually I'm answering a lot of the emails and read them.  But if you're just reading the emails, to me, that might have just went to a video link 
[02:32:00]  or whatever.  He's usually that, you know, this is what you said about the Owen Wilson thing.  Now, Sam Roberts, be honest.  Did you think that was two different stories?  No, I could see in hindsight, I should have in the email.  What is a hindsight?  That's when you look back and you have the the knowledge of what happens.  But you can look back then and go, oh, if only I knew.  Yeah, I should have specifically said there was a connection. 
[02:32:30]  But I knew that.  Yes.  If I didn't say that there was a possible relationship between him and Courtney Love.  Stupid.  That people would have said, why didn't we know if you didn't know the other thing?  Shut the fuck up.  Because there was no way to mention this without him thinking we were going there.  And again, this is two different Courtney Love stories.  Exactly.  She claimed that he got her pregnant.  Yeah.  Right.  And she also claimed separately that he had something to do with Owen Wilson's car problem.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  No wonder he wouldn't want to talk about her.  Sure.  Yeah.  He pretty much.  He's a tattletale.  He pretty much doesn't acknowledge the Courtney name at this point.  No.  Let's say hi to Matt on Long Island.  Did we find the Gene Simmons thing yet?  Are we still looking or did we give up looking?  Gave up looking?  Good.  No problem.  It's not like the new bosses are listening.  Matt on Long Island.  What's up?  Hold on.  Is anybody looking for the Gene Simmons?  E-Rock.  Who's looking for it?  Okay.  Go find it.  Matt on Long Island.  Hey, Jim.  You're a great interviewer.  You remember the time you interviewed the guys from X-Files and you asked them about their 
[02:33:30]  off-Broadway worst?  I am the fucking worst.  That was funny.  I got to give you that one.  One of the greatest uncomfortable moments ever.  I'm like, is he asking him about his acting skills?  Yes.  It's Chris Carter.  Chris Carter, right?  He's the creator.  Jim, that was a funny one.  On the off-season.  Sorry, but that was it.  So, Mulder, on the off-season.  Or I could call him Scully.  Did you really think you were talking to Mulder?  Be honest.  I didn't know the name, but I thought that they were two of the stars. 
[02:34:00]  Like the main guys.  Yeah, basically.  And I figured Duchovny must be one of the other guys.  Sure.  I figured we got these two and then there's Duchovny.  I don't know who the fuck they are.  Is he Scully or Mulder?  I don't even know.  Oh.  I don't know.  Duchovny?  Yeah.  Oh, Mulder.  I certainly have made my faux pas.  Anthony's the only one perfect in this trio.  Yeah, thank God, right?  Never have a trip up.  I acknowledge I make some good faux pas, but I enjoy when someone else faux pas.  Am I the worst?  I enjoy when someone else faux pas. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm such a fucking...  Yeah, but you know what?  I'm caught between...  In this one, I should have known better.  But I'm still annoyed at myself with that Philip Petit interview for not addressing the  fact that he was being fucking cunty.  How was he being cunty?  He just was...  It wasn't again.  When he said his name, I'll tell you, I remember, and Jimmy and I, you weren't there that day.  No, I was out.  Jimmy and I, we were big fans of this guy, and I even went...  I said, Philippe Petit, and he corrected me. 
[02:35:00]  Most people say Philippe Petit.  So I purposely was trying to say his name right, so I said Philippe Petit.  And what did he say?  When he corrected us, dude, the nuance was so slight, I'm like, you've got to be fucking  kidding me.  And at that point, I'm like, why aren't we ripping this guy's voice box out of his throat?  What was it?  Like, Philippe?  Something.  So subtle that only the French would know.  Only the French listeners, all five of them, would have known that we mispronounced this  douche's name.  I'm...  And to this day, I'm pissed that we didn't go after this guy. 
[02:35:30]  I am, too.  I am, too.  I'm mad at myself.  And again, I asked him about Alan Robert, or Alan Robert, who's the guy who climbs.  I'm like, well, you know, I was asking about another guy, and he was like, well, I don't  know him.  Just being a little faggot.  And I show him like you're lying.  You do know him.  Because he's French.  I just, I'm really mad that I didn't dress like a cunt.  Oh, look at Obama.  It's a big ass.  What?  What's her name?  She's got a nice ass.  Michelle Obama.  Michelle Obama has a nice ass.  She has an ass that is just... 
[02:36:00]  She's wearing a dress, too.  So that goes in a little further by the bottom of the leg, where the leg meets ass.  That's a nice ass.  She's got a big ass.  Jump in the trunk.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Did you say...  Tap daddy.  Where's my song, Danny?  Come on.  Oh, no.  What'd you do?  Yeah.  Don't go beating yourself up, Jimmy.  I'm disgusted with myself.  I can't tell you.  To try to please me.  That's all right, because we're all...  I love you just the way you are.  It's all right, because we're all disgusted with you. 
[02:36:30]  You should be.  Aw.  Well, I certainly am.  No.  What?  No.  Fucking fanboy faggot I am.  And unprepared to boot.  Be one or the other.  Unprepared fanboy.  Jesus Christ.  But you got your picture and your autograph, my friend.  But I really do.  The show, the guy's show, the Al Park's character, is fucking brilliant.  I mean, it really is hilariously a funny show.  Are you going to put your Coogan picture right next to your Madonna picture after you  trashed her?  Nah.  The wall of hate?  I don't hate him. 
[02:37:00]  I'm not even annoyed at him.  I'm annoyed at me.  I know.  But we learned that you hate Madonna, but you have an autographed picture of her up in  your apartment.  I really do.  I really...  And she's right next to Derek Jeter, who you also hate, right?  The wall of hate.  I love that.  It's either Jimmy hates them, or they hate Jimmy now.  Oh, Jimmy.  No more Mr. Nice Guy, man.  No.  And this is not about him.  I'm glad it went the way it did, because it could have been worse.  Jimmy, I want an up top for that.  No more Mr. Nice Guy for you.  Up top.  There you go.  Up top. 
[02:37:30]  I'm with Jimmy.  No more Mr. Nice Guy.  You?  Yeah, I've been too nice lately.  Really?  Oof.  No one's going to want to come in here.  I must be sick today, though, because I was like, man, I should have let that happen today.  It was...  You know what bugs me?  I was going to go, ask him, ask him about Owen.  Oh, shit.  Can I tell you something?  Hmm?  I was there.  I was so aggravated, not realizing the tie-in. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  That I was there.  And I'm really glad I didn't do it, because I would have felt like such a jerk-off, like  finding out all the facts afterwards.  Yeah.  Wait, someone is reminding us of another interview you did.  I don't remember this one.  I just suck, man.  Can we get a montage of Jimmy moments?  Jimmy interview moments?  Gotta have the dress about the dress.  The dress, the dress.  When you got the dress at the mall, something with a dress.  Yeah.  Love that one.  Faggot.  So we all have our great interview moments where we just suck a big fucking hairy hog.  Yeah, but I have nothing but those. 
[02:38:30]  Mr. Coogan, something about the drugs.  The drugs, there was something about drugs.  Owen, the drugs.  Ah, Pittsburgh.  And that's why he sarcastically said when I asked about Elizabeth Shue, oh yeah, we were  doing drugs.  Like, I guess he was just being sarcastic because he figured that's the road we're doing.  Yeah.  Why didn't we go?  We should have went all in.  We were slight in at that point.  We didn't know.  You might as well go all in.  Didn't know.  I'll tell you why.  Oh, does this have something to do with the Owen Wilson thing?  What was that about again?  Because we just meant, or Jimmy just meant, you know, the sex with Courtney, not the fact 
[02:39:00]  that she said that you just about killed Owen Wilson.  Holy shit.  Damn.  Let's say hi to Mike in Pittsburgh.  Mike.  Good morning, buh, buh, buh, buh, boys.  Hi.  Do you remember that mundane interview you did with Craig from Craigslist and how...  Hold on.  Can I slow you down?  That always makes us feel good when you hear...  Remember that mundane interview?  That mundane interview.  That we had to sit through out here in Radio Land? 
[02:39:30]  I thought he just remembered what day of the week we did it and said that Monday interview.  Right.  I didn't think we were being insulted.  All right.  Yes.  I sort of remember that mundane interview with the guy that started Craigslist.  Yes.  Yes.  And you kept saying...  He kept calling him fag under his breath and Anthony had to get louder and louder to  cover up Opie's insults.  Yeah.  That's right.  I've done that for many years.  What's wrong with that?  Oh, nothing at all.  Good job, Opie.  Well, because he was being such a dick that day.  I'm like, all right, I'll show you dick. 
[02:40:00]  Exactly.  Prostitution is what we come there for and he doesn't want to admit it.  Oh, that's what it was all about.  He was so downplaying the whole prostitution...  Don't even call it prostitution.  Using Craigslist to hook up angle.  He was like, oh, it's a great place to go to get furniture and an apartment.  I'm like, all right.  But what about the sex thing?  That is a very small part of what we're about.  That's right.  Thank you for the reminder there, Mike. 
[02:40:30]  He probably has to say that because otherwise he's knowingly let prostitution go on his...  All right.  Can we get the boys together to do Uncomfortable Interview Day?  When can we get that together?  Just pieces.  Not the whole interview, but just Uncomfortable Interview Day.  By the way, the Gene Simmons interview was in 2001.  What?  We're going way back.  That was the first AEW.  Oh, yeah.  That's where that happened.  Oh, well, now Iraq knows where to look.  Tippi Tom was in that day.  Jeez, I don't remember.  Singing.  It's definitely a good show, then.  Yep. 
[02:41:00]  Yep.  Tippi Tom, yeah.  Yep.  People say you do a good Osborne interview, though, Jimmy.  Perfect every time.  I'm just a fanboy.  Perfect every time.  I get nothing out of people, which is fine.  That's not what my job is, but then I shouldn't talk to them.  It's fucking...  I'm just...  Aw.  I'm just...  I'm really...  For real.  I'm just disgusted with myself right now, and I should be.  40 years old, like a faggot with a fucking camera.  You are so tough on yourself.  But accurate.  But I'm accurate.  No.  You're too tough on yourself. 
[02:41:30]  The most accurate person I know.  He's too tough on himself.  No, the most accurate person I know.  No, but I really am.  Jesus.  I am.  I fucking...  I'm good to myself, and I deserve it.  And I'm fucking harsh on myself, and I deserve that.  I got a song for you.  All right.  Coin City Yourself at home.  That did cheer me up a little.  What a British accent that is.  I've been singing that all night.  Yeah, we need a montage.  People are requesting montage of uncomfortable interviewing moments. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  We need that.  We've all had them, so we can just pull them out.  It doesn't have to be strictly one person.  Jim Norton.  No.  You know, we've all had them.  We all have our weird techniques.  Oh, of course.  You like to ask questions with both your hands on your chin, so...  Like this.  Anthony's position.  Is that me?  Yeah, because you...  Do I do this?  That doesn't feel familiar.  No, it sounds like you're doing that.  Yeah?  You get fanboy-ish.  Oh, no.  When girls come in here, it's a total fucking write-off for me. 
[02:42:30]  I lose my mind.  You forget that you're doing a radio show with others.  I can't ask real questions and stuff.  They're all goofy, and I giggle like a chick, and my voice gets all high when I talk to  the girls that I like in movies.  Yeah.  I'm a fucking faggot.  No.  Not right.  Let's say hi to Ben in Arizona.  Ben.  Ah!  Ben. 
[02:43:00]  Yes?  What's up?  I just wanted to point out one of Anthony's little faux pas when he fell asleep interviewing  Drew Curtis from FARC.com.  Oh, was that when he was in?  Yeah.  All right.  Hasn't been back since, by the way.  Wow.  Good friend of the show, and that, you know...  All of a sudden, Anthony turned into the other million people that were listening.  Not exactly a ball of energy.  I like the sight, but Jesus, you know...  I don't think that's good for the resume.  And they tend to fall asleep as you're interviewing them. 
[02:43:30]  Hey, I want to do that show where the host could possibly fall asleep in the middle of  the interview.  Who makes up the headlines over there at FARC?  Yeah, but you know what, man?  You'll at least call people out.  But, like, in that case, I don't think he should...  Again, blaboring a dead point, but now that I know the whole picture...  Yeah.  But, like, when Star came in...  Oh, I fucking went after him.  You really did.  And it stopped him from doing that.  Like, he was being a dick at first, because I think he mistook us being nice to him as 
[02:44:00]  being fucking, like, like, oh, we're in awe of you.  No.  He walked in and said, kiss the ring.  And basically what he was trying to say is, I have now officially done the craziest thing  in radio, kiss the ring.  I go, kiss my ass.  Well, you called him out for being...  And then he was fine.  We've all done the call out.  Yeah, but on that one, you really called him out, and...  Oh, yeah, I did play German Speeches once.  Oh, whatever.  Oh, right.  With the guy from Hogan's Heroes. 
[02:44:30]  Oh.  Robert Cleary?  Cleary, Clary.  Yeah.  Something like that.  What about that porno girl that was in Deep Throat?  When you started playing the porno music over her sister's phone call?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  To raise money for her funeral.  She was dead.  It was Linda Lovelace.  She had done Deep Throat, the movie, and regretted it her entire life.  She dies.  We get Linda Lovelace's sister on the phone to talk about raising money for a funeral, because 
[02:45:00]  she died broke.  And Opie starts playing porno music behind her sister fucking talking.  And just asking all questions about Deep Throat.  Oh, God.  That was a bad one.  Wow.  That could be worse than playing the Hitler clips over...  I haven't heard that one in a while.  Robert Cleary?  Robert Cleary's interview.  My favorite ever, though, as where I sit, I'm sure we all have our favorites.  And you were lucky enough not to be part of it, Ed.  The Ed Asner interview is still one of my favorites.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, well, I heard it.  I heard the clips of it, or the replay of it.  Yeah, I was busy playing poker.  Me and Joe Rogan and Jimmy, you were playing poker.  Steve the Whistler was a good one, too.  Fuck.  I see that.  God, did he just get...  I see that whistling douche in my neighborhood all the time.  Do you?  Yep.  Does he whistle as he walks down the street?  Yes, he does.  What about...  Shut up with your whistling.  I remember there was a pretty lengthy silent game with Mr. DVD where he kept calling back. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, yes, Mr. DVD.  Six times, I think.  It was another horrific interview.  What's her name from Laverna Shirley?  Cindy Williams.  Cindy Williams.  Travis reminded me of the toothpick guy that came up here the other day.  Toothpick guy.  We've had some really horrific moments.  The toothpick guy is one of my biggest disappointments ever.  I wanted to smash that toothpick guy so bad, and I just couldn't get him to hand it over  to me.  Yeah.  And then we spilled mustard on the Asian guy as he was coming into the building. 
[02:46:30]  What's his wee shit?  The guy that had a walk in the building with mustard all over his hair and his suit.  He didn't know where he came from.  Probably thought a big fucking...  Big giant fucking Duffy bird shit on him.  We got away with that one, by the way.  Yeah.  Because he was trying to find out.  Oh, he certainly was.  Yes.  You're right, Jimmy?  We're trying to make you feel good.  We're talking about other moments.  Did you see what happens? 
[02:47:00]  No matter what happens, we've all been douches, but I'm just really disgusted with myself  in that area.  You had your Chris Jericho moment.  That was right up there, man.  That was right up there.  That was a good one.  Guys that are bigger than me, for some reason, I'm more comfortable having confrontation with.  Because you're a tough guy.  It's not that, though, at all.  The guy could have murdered me.  Jimmy's a tough guy in front of a microphone.  I don't get like ever trying to physical with...  No, no.  You fucking berate them with your wit.  I just tend to get very defensive if I feel like someone is trying to use their size over 
[02:47:30]  me.  I don't know why it's that way.  Like, why would I be confrontational with him or with the pen the first time he was in?  Like, I don't know.  I'm just annoyed at myself for my inconsistency.  I really am.  It was a bad interview.  It was an uncomfortable interview.  And I'm just mad at the way I did it.  You're, you're, you're, you're only human.  I know.  I am.  Yeah.  Um, the TMZ kid is reminding me of the, uh, of course, Richard Jenny interview.  Oh.  But someone else is, uh, reminding us about Jimmy's, one of Jimmy's greatest interviewing 
[02:48:00]  moments.  Uh, the first Ramon bit when we were, when we were talking to one man, uh, star Wars  guy.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, one man star Wars guy.  We were so awkward as he was doing his thing.  Boy, have we had some real shit on this show.  Can we get some of these?  I want to play some of these.  Yeah.  Like just some of these uncomfortable moments.  Just a moment or two.  Yeah.  A couple of moments would be good.  Yeah.  Jeff Ross on the next dance with stars. 
[02:48:30]  I heard about that.  And he's really, that's a legit.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Completely.  I read that too.  Good for Jeff, man.  He's really fucking, that's what a, that's a big thing, man.  That show is, we hate it, but that show is massive.  But he's got a bum hip.  Massive.  He's got a bum hip.  And, uh, I, I didn't, he doesn't seem the dancing type to me.  We should get him on the phone and see what that's about.  Um, I think Kim Kardashian is going to be one of the cast members too.  I am.  Yep.  With that ace. 
[02:49:00]  She got some jump in the trunk.  Yep.  Oh, oh.  Jesse Ventura, Jimmy.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That, for some reason.  One of your greatest moments.  Yeah, it was a good one.  Under those circumstances, I'm fine.  He took on an ex-marine that basically said, you know, don't sleep because you'll be dead.  Navy SEAL.  You got to sleep sometime.  Let's remember that, Jimmy.  Under the, no, but I'm not, I, under those circumstances, I'm, I'm actually, uh, when  it's a heated debate about something or an argument, I'm okay. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Um, but it just, like, like this situation or the French situation, I'm just, I'm shit.  Mm.  Hey.  Not as a person, but as an on-air person.  Well, that's debatable.  But, uh.  Poor Jimmy.  No, I believe, dude, 100% I'm a good.  He's beating himself up.  But accurately.  Not for, not for pity.  But because I'm really thinking that.  Chester's liver is reminding us, and I don't remember this one, the speed reading interview,  or the speed reader interview.  Oh, I kind of remember that.  What was bad about that one? 
[02:50:00]  What did we do wrong with that one?  I think the pages were coming out of the book.  Not sure.  Chester's liver.  You got to help me out.  I don't remember that one.  The speed reader interview is a classic, too.  Why?  Oh, the first time The Rock was on the show, yeah, it was really uncomfortable.  Oh, that was.  The Leslie Nielsen interview, but that, that should have got more legs.  Oh, the Tucker Max interview, which got some, um, coverage lately on, uh, recently on Gawker.com.  Yeah, they did just mention that on Gawker.  Someone else was, someone was asking me about that. 
[02:50:30]  That fucking Tucker Max with his fake stories, and he's becoming huge because of it.  Uh, they might even be making a movie out of, out of that book of his that is full of  so many lies in our humble opinion, and we called him out on it on our show.  I, um, it was really weird because that moment we all realized at the same time, we were all  completely with the guy.  We were rolling, enjoying him very much, and then when you kind of feel like you're not  in on it, like, like, he's really talking to us like we're fucking dummies and we're  going to believe this. 
[02:51:00]  Right.  Yeah.  What do you expect?  Then you got to turn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Burp.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, people are just saying, Jimmy, you know, don't beat yourself up.  No, I should, and I'll continue to because it's accurate.  Oh, no.  I'm not beating myself up like, oh, I don't have talent, I'm not a funny guy, but in this  one, uh, my, my self-disgust is deserved.  Yeah.  Tommy Lee, of course, yeah, that was a, that was a solid moment. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  We showed him, he's massively huge, and we're still fucking doing radio.  Hey, though.  We show these people in the end, don't we, Ian?  Yes, we do.  Remember when we told The Rock that we'll be more famous than him?  Yeah, that worked out for us, didn't it?  You didn't really say that, did you?  Oh, yeah.  Something like that.  It got so ugly with The Rock.  I'm like, you know, you're just like one of these, you're, I don't remember exactly,  but basically it was like, you're, you're a wrestler. 
[02:52:00]  You're, you're going to come and, you're going to come and go.  We'll always be more famous than you.  Yeah.  We're such fucking cocky assholes, and boy, that worked out, huh?  Oh, always.  I think he's starring in his seventh blockbuster movie.  Yeah.  It's never going to work.  And we lost another three markets overnight.  Wonderful.  That shit made a sailor.  Just barreling towards success. 
[02:52:30]  We're just assholes.  We actually told The Rock what, what was up.  Yeah.  We're doing that Q Wrestling thing.  This is where it's at, my friend.  Yeah, you keep doing that.  Injure yourself.  You'll never get anywhere.  Could you find what I said to The Rock?  All right, we found the Gene Simmons thing, Jimmy.  So this goes back to 2001.  Was this the first time that you interviewed Gene Simmons?  Yep.  Because Ann and I, early on in our NEW career, we were lucky to have the entire band in, 
[02:53:00]  and you weren't talking about uncomfortable.  We were freaking the fuck out.  And this was a little later down the road, a couple years later.  Jimmy's now doing our show.  And we're laughing at Jimmy because, like, Jimmy, your hero's here.  You haven't said shit.  And this is how it went down.  Gene, thank you.  Had a ball.  This has been a pleasure, especially for Norton, who said nothing.  Norton, come on, say something.  I was just very happy to see you.  One question.  What can I ask him? 
[02:53:30]  Can I push in your cheek?  You've been a fan for over 25 years.  Yeah.  One question.  We met, and I want to get a picture.  There's not one question you want to ask him.  Something that he can answer.  Can you still talk to Star Stowe?  You know, it's not even funny.  Star Stowe passed away.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Great question.  That's the one name I remember from the 70s.  Jesus.  Star Stowe was a beautiful playmate.  Playmate.  In 70-something.  She was gorgeous.  She's never going to come back now.  But, you know, she had a wonderful life, and unfortunately, it didn't last long enough.  I'm sorry to say.  She was the girl from the, I think, the chopper poster. 
[02:54:00]  Gorgeous.  Gorgeous girl.  Beautiful.  Nice.  Even being innocent.  All right.  Thanks for bringing the show down, Norton.  I just, that's the only name I could think of.  Oh, good job.  God, do I suck.  I remember, I remember that you laughed in that, but you didn't, he just thought I was  kidding.  Who was laughing, like, during the whole thing?  Was that just you now, or?  Yeah, because it's just hilarious.  Yeah, that, I added the laugh today.  I couldn't help it.  She's dead.  She's, she's, she's, she's, she's, she's dead. 
[02:54:30]  Shut up.  Gene.  Had enough of Gene Simmons, for the love of God.  And he came back, though.  Over and over.  Of course he will.  Over and over.  If he's got something to plug, he'll be back.  Ugh.  Douche.  Okay.  Well.  Should we take a break?  Well, if somebody's got to piss or eat.  Why was the Donna D'Erico, or Derrico interview uncomfortable? 
[02:55:00]  You guys got to help us out, because we don't, we got memories like goldfish here.  Remember that?  No.  And Chester's liver didn't help me out yet.  Why was the Speed Reader interview uncomfortable?  I don't remember any of these.  All right.  We'll find out the answers to those two questions, and we'll do other stuff after the break. 
[02:55:30]  Dweezler on Instant Feedback.  Nick, Anthony?  Yes.  They remember one of your uncomfortable moments.  What did I do?  How about when Ant asked Cal Ripken Jr. about Kevin Costner?  Ah, see, because I didn't know about that situation.  That was you, my friend.  And someone brought up, why don't we bring up the Kevin Costner thing?  And I was like, I had no idea what it was.  So I was like, hey, what's with the Kevin Costner thing?  There was a real strong rumor that Cal Ripken Jr. found out that Kevin Costner may have been 
[02:56:00]  with Cal's wife, and he was in the middle of a fine hitting streak, or a game's played streak.  Where they decided to make believe the lights weren't working at the stadium, so he could  actually go home and see what the hell was going on.  Right.  That was the rumor.  And Snopes said no to that rumor?  Yes.  Snopes said that's not true.  But he doesn't want to talk about it whatsoever, and you brought it up to Cal Ripken Jr. 
[02:56:30]  Whoopsie.  The great Cal Ripken Jr.  How the fuck am I supposed to know about goddamn Kevin Costner and Cal Ripken?  Mm-hmm.  I didn't think it was some kind of a seedy little, you know, love triangle rumor.  Mm-hmm.  I know.  All right.  All right. 
[02:57:00]  It's so cold in the deep.  How the fuck do we post to keep peace?  What's all on a nigger's mind?  Merkin' and doin' time.  It's so cold in the deep. 
[02:57:30]  How the fuck do we post to keep peace?  What's all on a nigger's mind?  Merkin' and doin' time.  Mason, he was like a brother to me.  Shit, we all used to slang.  Blades from trees, playin', drinkin' games and shit.  Always in the big thing.  This is an exclusive, by the way.  This is the music Obama's coming out to on, what, Thursday?  Yeah.  Yeah, is it? 
[02:58:00]  He's really gonna fuck it up Thursday.  He's gonna come out to this music.  Just all of his votes.  Gone.  What song should he come out to?  Hmm.  Either 911's a joke or...  No.  I don't think that would help him.  What would it be, though?  Say, ah, what the hell.  I don't think that would help.  I want to see how tolerant America really is.  Let's see how loyal these white voters really are. 
[02:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  I'm having memories of what we used to do.  But now we're gone, we can't do what we do.  Donny, donny, donny, for the fuck we grew it so proud in the deep.  How the fuck do we post to keep peace?  What's the D?  The D?  Yeah, does anyone know what the D is?  I get the cold part.  I know what it is, you guys want to guess?  Dick.  What's the deal?  It's cold in the D.  Oh. 
[02:59:00]  Detroit?  I'm thinking in the hood.  Oh, Detroit.  Detroit, motherfucker.  It's cold in the D.  Well, fuck yeah, it's cold in the D.  Is the mayor still walking the streets?  Maybe you start there.  Maybe the mayor should stay out of trouble.  I have my finger on the pulse of urban America.  We'll fall on a nigga's mind.  Working at your time.  It's so cold in the D.  Cold in the D.  What's wrong with the D?  It's cold.  It's cold. 
[02:59:30]  But it's summer.  It's fucking cold in the D.  Is it, like, figuratively?  Where are we at?  Because it's a comfortable day here in New York.  But it's cold in the D.  In what way?  I don't know.  Johnny N. from New York City is suggesting that Obama comes out to fuck the police.  Oh, that'll be a good one.  Did you see just one guy, the sound guy, just going, switch?  Sound guy can fuck it up for everybody.  Switch. 
[03:00:00]  He'd be a legend, though.  Oh.  Would he ever.  Of course, Pat from Menachee suggests that he comes out to the Jefferson's team.  There they go.  Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama. 
[03:00:30]  Obama.  Yeah.  Coming out, making his way onto the stage with wife Michelle.  Walking like George.  Yeah.  Wife Michelle and her amazing traps.  And the family's two children walking out on stage now.  Yep.  Greeting vice presidential nominee Joseph Biden, who Barack humorously calls that honky. 
[03:01:00]  Anyone else notice that Joseph Biden is maybe five years away from looking like that old  guy that looks through the screen door in Poltergeist?  You're all gonna die.  That's scary.  All right.  Let me get back to this cold in the D, E-Rock.  Of how we used to hang and bang.  It was never no complaining being in the D.  It's bad for your health.  How the fuck is supposed to...  Terrible.  Why are they complaining in the D? 
[03:01:30]  Because it's cold.  Yeah, but they don't have a mayor.  They can get their way with whatever the hell they want now.  It's hard to keep the peace.  They don't get the man.  It's hard to keep the peace.  And it's all on a nigger's mind.  What are you doing?  But he's reciting the lyrics.  I'm just saying.  That's why it's so cold.  Please tell me that was lyrics you just recited.  What do you mean cold?  Like, not literally cold, right?  It's like, it's cold.  She looks pretty bundled up there.  I don't see how she's going to be cold.  Oh, wow.  Is that it?  She's got the chopped meat hair and everything. 
[03:02:00]  Holy shit.  Damn.  It's cold in the D.  It must be cold in the D.  Holy fuck.  Oh, shit.  It's cold in the D.  Got my Mercedes.  14-year-old Mercedes.  Yeah, that's an old fucking piece of shit Mercedes.  It's Foss's car.  Look at my new Mercedes.  Yeah, look at this great camera work and special effects.  If it's cold in the D, why isn't she inside?  Yeah.  The whole video shot outside on the street.  It's cold in the D.  Most people understand if it's cold in the D, you go inside for a while. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, why don't you wrap in D as indoors?  They're dancing now.  How about we do another Obama song?  Ladies and gentlemen, you're the next president of the United States of America, making his  way to the stage, Barack Obama.  Ah. 
[03:03:00]  There it is.  He's not getting hassled or hustled.  My favorite part is when she really screeches it out.  Where's that part?  Yeah.  Is it coming up?  Oh, yeah.  Good times.  Easy credit and rip-offs.  Good times.  Scratching and surviving.  Good times.  Hanging in a jar.  Good times.  Yeah.  Make me lucky we got on.  Here we go.  Good times.  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  Hell yeah.  Good times.  What is the line?  Easy credit what?  Rip-offs or something?  Easy credit what is it again?  I think it's rip-offs.  Yeah, we could do that one next.  Yeah.  Uh, but it's cold in the D.  The paper's when these niggas won't you well.  It's hard in the D when you're trying to keep peace.  Now you can rest my niggas.  You don't have to worry about them sex niggas trying to throw sex in sex and give them distress.  You know you don't know what's right. 
[03:04:00]  That's why the niggas tried to.  How could you tell?  She could be one of the ugliest fucking bitches I've ever fucking seen.  She has raggedy Ann hair.  Holy shit.  It's hard to take care of yourself when it's cold in the D.  In the D.  Why isn't she wearing an H on her head?  If it's so cold in the D, put on an H.  You N?  How about some E-M?  Oh shit.  Fuck no.  Oh fuck. 
[03:04:30]  All right, listen.  It's cold in the D.  I see my niggas gone to that better place now.  I know your mom, your man's going through something.  They'll be okay.  All the real niggas gone and the worms are left.  So cold in the D.  How the fuck do we supposed to keep peace?  What's all on the niggas' mind? 
[03:05:00]  So what is she trying to say with this song?  I don't know.  It's tough to keep the peace.  It's cold in the D.  What's going on?  Yeah, it's tough to keep the peace.  What?  Is it cold?  Or is there a problem in the community?  I know Russia invaded Georgia.  Are they going to invade Detroit next?  Yeah, it's cold in the D.  And how do you keep the peace?  What are they talking about?  Gang violence?  I don't know.  They're dancing.  Is that her son there behind her?  I don't know.  It's probably too cold in the D. 
[03:05:30]  Why is everybody fighting in the cold?  Just fucking behave yourselves.  Oh, her name is T-Baby, by the way.  T-Baby.  T-Baby is, ugh.  Is that terrible?  As in 10th baby.  He just goes up a letter.  Be E-Baby next.  Wow, T-Baby sucks a dick.  It's cold in the D.  All right, let's get back to It's Cold in the D.  It's so cold in the D. 
[03:06:00]  It's so cold in the D.  How about you write more lyrics so we don't have to keep hearing the It's Cold in the D part.  You know, call me crazy, but it's going to be tough to get airplay with the how-the-fuck lyric.  It's a lyric.  It's all on the niggas mind.  Smirking at one time.  We all were together.  It was Mason.  Rest in peace to you, big baby.  M-Daw, T-Baby, Tyrone, Antoine, Baby, Marie, Moe Dog, D-O, Ray-Ray. 
[03:06:30]  Rest in peace to my nigga, Ray-Ray.  We get it.  It's cold.  Ray-Ray, it's cold.  Put some fucking gloves on it.  Shut up.  Ray-Ray ain't hearing nothing, man.  No.  Ray-Ray's in the G.  Oh, well, then it's cold in the sea where he's fucking laying.  This part of the song isn't fun. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, now we're back to the fun.  This is fucking abysmal.  We're almost done.  Cold in the D.  Danny looked through the glass there into the producer's studio and started laughing 
[03:07:30]  his ass off.  Oh, let me see.  What, what, what, what?  Oh, look, you know.  Oh, come on.  That phone call would get us fired.  Let them play the home version of the O.P.  Anthony show.  Figure out what the T stands for.  So cold in the D.  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage, the next president of the United States of 
[03:08:00]  America, Barack Obama.  Oh.  Barack making his way on the stage, apparently with a basketball and rerun.  Did you hear, did you see what song they played for Ted Kennedy yesterday?  Um, let's see.  What was it?  We're rifling through.  It was a, I know. 
[03:08:30]  Uh, Presidents of the USA lump.  Oh, God.  I think it was, uh, Still the One, was it?  I don't know.  Still the One?  Was it that?  Still the One.  Oh, Stunt Brain doesn't work over here, so we don't get knowledge over here.  Just that political knowledge.  Yeah, that's true.  The Beatles, I'm fixing a hole where my brain leaks out.  No?  I like it.  Oof.  Ah.  You're still the One.  Was it still the One? 
[03:09:00]  Why did my iPhone just kick me offline?  It might have been still the One.  All right.  This doesn't sound like the song they'd bring him out to.  And cut.  All right.  Your life will soon be done.  It's so cold in the day.  Who's not singing that all day long?  It's so cold in the day.  It's so cold in the day.  How'd you find that one?  I don't know.  It was just on one of the...  Someone's saying we need to play Cake Farter or Cake Fart. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, enough with the Cake Farts already.  Is it bad?  Well, it's just a girl farting on cake.  Oh, that's it?  It's been sent to me a thousand times.  Yeah.  A thousand.  I think we made our point with the Obama song.  Yes, we did.  Yeah, there's plenty of them.  It's so cold in the day.  In the day.  Are we still broadcasting?  Yeah, apparently.  If you want to have Cake Farts, you can do it.  Here's Cake Fart, Ant.  What is this? 
[03:10:00]  Enjoy the Cake Fart.  Here we go.  There's a cake.  All right.  There's a cake.  An awful layer cake.  You know what I like the most?  What?  My buck teeth.  Cake Farts.  Cake Farts?  What is that?  Well, we're going to find out, Anthony.  She's licking the cake.  She's wearing a little top.  Let's get this done.  Is she wearing a bottom?  Why is she trying to make this sexy?  Looks like she got big ass.  She's probably not.  She's leading you into doing something gross.  Cake Farts.  She looks...  Damn, she has a nice fucking little body.  I don't know.  She kind of looks big on the ass a little.  Yeah, she's not that great.  She's got the tiny boobies. 
[03:10:30]  You guys are nuts.  She's a juicy fucking grump.  What about her teeth, Jimmy?  Cares.  Have her open a can after you fuck her.  What do you say?  Why don't we do it?  Yeah, we're going to do this cake fart.  You do that cake fart.  I like that fucking...  Jesus.  All right.  She's squatting.  I'm filling up.  She's farting on the cake. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, now all the icing came up and it looks like shit on her ass.  Oh.  The puckering ass.  Here we go.  Danny, I kind of like it.  I'm sorry.  Cake fart rules.  Yeah, but I know that you...  Well, could you imagine what would have happened if I said, here, oh, play this. 
[03:11:30]  It's great.  Right.  Here's cake farts.  It's called cake farts.  You would have been like, what the fuck is this?  I love how her asshole looks like an opera singer.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Oh, she's done with the cake farting.  No, I don't think so.  What a fucking ass she has, man.  Are we doing cake shitting in a second?  Dude, I swear, I'm filling up.  Yeah, you like that?  Why?  That's comedy, not sexy, Jimmy?  I think there's another one called pudding.  She got an ass that I guess you could fucking...  Dude, she's got an ass for days.  Pudding farts?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Never ends.  Same chick?  Different chick?  What are we looking at?  I don't like she's wearing panties.  Uh-huh.  Tell me.  Doesn't that smell delicious?  I can't smell it, dummy.  Much better with my fart smell on it.  Someone's suggesting peanut butter fire.  Oh, I thought this was all for the treatment.  Peanut butter fire.  Dot com.  Oh, there we go.  Underwear's off.  All right, now we're getting something.  Sitting in the pudding.  Jesus.  That's great. 
[03:12:30]  Come on.  Fart.  Okay, now.  Here, come and get your pudding.  That's right.  A nugget flew out.  Oh, shit.  A nugget flew out.  Oh, no, it didn't.  She fucking goes to fart with pudding on her ass, and it's vanilla pudding, and a fucking  piece of shit flies about a foot and a half. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, my God.  That's the price you pay.  Can they see this out there?  You guys can see it?  Oh, I'm sorry.  No.  Wow, Jimmy's filling up.  Why are you filling up over a pudding fart?  Jimmy's filling up.  It's her ass.  It's something about her.  It's really sexy.  It's so cold in the deep.  In the deep.  All right.  Look at this shit.  All right, watch, guys.  For the live audience.  Pudding fart.  She fucking lost a milk dud. 
[03:13:30]  What was the other one?  Peanut butter farts?  Peanut butter farts?  It was all the same girl?  I don't think so.  I don't think so either.  That's a franchise.  B Fitz from Staten Island is calling her Freddie Mercury teeth.  Yeah.  Well, she's got Freddie Mercury blood.  I'll fuck her.  There's peanut butter farts.  She'll have it after you're done.  Oh, she's sexy.  All right.  Someone's spreading peanut butter right on her asshole with a little knife.  Kind of like how you put peanut butter on a celery stalk.  On celery, right.  He's really getting it in there.  Yeah, you know, you want to spread the peanut butter around. 
[03:14:00]  Evenly.  You don't want too many calories and cholesterol with your peanut butter.  Here we go.  All right.  This girl's a pig.  She rules.  She's trying to push the air through the peanut butter.  She is a gassy bitch.  She's fucking.  She does roll in such a weird way. 
[03:14:30]  It's so cold in the day.  She's for dinner.  Helium balloons.  Wow, that's a good find.  Yeah.  Good find.  Someone's suggesting meatloaf farts.  Meatloaf farts?  Why?  Meatloaf farts.  Can we get girls to come in and do this?  Let's find her.  She might be local.  We want to have girls come in and shit on a table, too.  Yeah, a glass table, Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Glass table.  We've got to keep it clean. 
[03:15:00]  Otherwise, it'll be silly.  At this point, it doesn't matter, though.  We only have, what?  40 days?  How many days are we down to?  I think it's 33 or 4.  That's it?  I think so, yeah.  What?  Let me check.  What?  It's so cold in the day.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  What are you...  What is this?  No, I really don't think you should...  Oh, my God.  What is she doing?  Meatloaf farts?  Those are fake farts, by the way, people. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  We live in the world of real.  Meatloaf farts is a fraud.  That's right.  Not like pudding farts and cake farts, which are real.  35 days.  35 days left?  35 days, 13 hours, 33 minutes, and zero seconds.  Don't make me hit that button.  Everyone just shuts up.  It's so cold in the day.  Oh, that's my...  That's our meatloaf.  It's all over here.  Oh, my God. 
[03:16:00]  Do you see this?  I'm depressed now.  And her acting is so good.  Sorry.  How are you sorry?  Like, she didn't know she was going to do it.  Yeah.  You put meatloaf on a chair and flops your pussy  and asshole on it.  That's where sorry doesn't work.  Yeah.  When you're completely naked putting your asshole in the dinner.  And then she does it again.  Your asshole's on the meatloaf when you're farting.  Right.  Where's the accident part?  Right.  Sorry's like, oopsie, I spilled water.  I recognize that fart from the machine.  The last one. 
[03:16:30]  They're fake.  We've all farted on a meatloaf, but it usually happens when you're not expecting it to.  Sure.  Of course.  Like, you're in the living room and someone puts a meatloaf under your ass while you're  watching the game.  I'm with you, Jimmy.  And you fart.  And you fart.  You don't know.  Then you say, I'm sorry.  The best is when you can fart into a jar and put the lid back on real quick.  How long does that last?  Like, a few minutes.  Yeah?  Why doesn't it last forever?  It, um...  I don't know.  Hey, Russian broad, you got any tricks today?  Good question.  We got Russian broad out there today.  What?  Maybe she could fart on some food products. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Russian broad, you want to fart on food products for everybody?  What do you got today?  Anything?  You guys are becoming a hit on YouTube with the kicking of the groin.  What's the search for the kicking of the groin video again?  Pat Duffy kicked in the nuts.  Kicked in the nuts on YouTube.  It's getting some nice views today.  Of course.  I think it's got like 8,000 views between YouTube and Foundry.  What?  It's pretty good.  That sucks, actually.  We've gone a million on solo videos.  In less than 24 hours? 
[03:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  24 hours.  The first 24 hours is very important.  Extremely.  The life of a YouTube video.  Yeah, baby bird video got close to a million the first day.  Yeah.  Yes.  I got about two, two and a half million now on my...  All right.  Stop being a braggart.  ...stellar, um...  Vista.  You're being a braggart.  Yeah, I am.  It's so cold in the deep.  What's up with this Metallica song, Danny?  I don't even have to compromise my dignity.  Which one do you got there?  Because you got two.  Yeah, but you reached the geek culture.  Yeah, I did.  That's what I do now. 
[03:18:00]  That's the new one.  That one just hit this morning.  How is it?  No one is right here yet?  Honestly, I heard like the first...  Are we the first station or radio show playing this Metallica song?  I don't think...  I think there are a few stations that have played it, but it's so early.  It's so early that...  It's so early.  It's so early.  We need someone that listens to Squiz.  Is Squiz playing My Apocalypse?  No, they can't because it's not in Dillette.  I had to pull it off of...  I had to pull it, yeah.  So this could be a world exclusive?  This could be an XM exclusive.  Can we play this instead of taking a break?  Or is that going to be true?  Yeah, no, we can do that.  Yeah, we can do that.  All right, motherfuckers.  That's what we do.  It's both, Hopi. 
[03:18:30]  Jimmy, you didn't sing It's Cold in a D.  I don't care.  Is this new Metallica?  Brand new.  All right, so we're going to be listening to...  It's so cold!  It's horrible drumming.  Horrible drumming by Lars, I guess.  We like Lars.  As per Danny.  We like the Lars.  He sucks, is what Danny says.  He's a bag of shit.  He's a bag of shit.  I feel for Lars because...  Well, because...  It's so cold in a day. 
[03:19:00]  Metallica, my eclipse?  My...  What is it called?  My Apocalypse.  My Eclipse.  My Pockyclips.  Maybe I should tell everybody at this point that I'm very lightheaded because in between  shows I shit my brains out to the point it was water.  Coin City yourself?  I think I'm dehydrated.  Yeah.  Yes.  What are they listening to?  Coin City yourself?  These fuckers are doing their own show on the bleachers.  What are you watching? 
[03:19:30]  The motherfucking Russian broad is showing her...  She's holding fucking court.  She's holding court and showing everybody the kick to the groin video.  Someone's a kicker in the cunt.  I'll buy shoes.  Hmm.  All right.  Are we going to get girls in here to fart on stuff?  Shit first.  Shit first?  You got to go fart before shit.  Shit on the table.  On the table.  We got to go table shit.  We always say we're going to do these things.  We never do them.  Let's get a...  By the way, XM51 has been playing this all week eight times a day.  Well, then I'd love for someone to show me where it is in XM's master computer. 
[03:20:00]  Unless they're playing it off of...  They're probably playing the other song.  They just...  This was...  No, he's thinking of the other song, The Day That Never Comes.  That's been getting the shit played out of it.  This Metallica just released this morning.  All right.  Literally.  We'll play it instead of commercials.  Hey, by the way, I want to thank pear-shaped wrestling fan from Melbourne.  Oh, let's thank Eric.  What is that?  Oh.  Eric.  He's been trying to turn us on to a video.

It's on right videos, I believe.  Why'd you knock the motherfucker out?  This guy's been writing this in all morning long.  Hip-hop Jimmy.  What happened, Greg?  Oh, Jimmy.  Some guy thought he could take a punch.  Copy-paste, copy-paste.  It's kind of like that girl that punched D-Rock and almost knocked him down, I should say.  She punched him in the belly.  Look at this.  If it's the same video I'm thinking of, I think this girl was in the Olympics. 
[03:21:00]  Knocks out drunk guys.  And that's the beauty of this video.  Hot chick knocks out a drunk guy is the name.  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  I guess it's buffering.  Is it buffering?  Yeah.  Buffering.  Loading.  Oh, this is a different one.  Never mind.  What is this?  Sorry, I apologize to that guy.  Come on.  This guy.  This guy dares his chick to punch him. 
[03:21:30]  All right.  He got knocked the fuck out.  No one can fall like that.  That was no bullshit.  He hit his head on the fucking garbage thing.  No one can fall like that because your reaction would be to put your hands up.  Oh, my God.  That's a good one.  That's right videos?  Ah, good.  Find the other one where it's the Olympic girl.  Well, someone out there will have the link.  Wow, she socked them.  Some Olympic girl hit this guy at a party and he went down.

Like how did that come up?  I don't know  She was singing all kinds of  Lyrics from high school plays  Or not high school  Like junior high  And elementary school  And she had her terrible lisp  Oh that's  Where she talks like this 
[03:32:30]  And she was singing with the lisp  Like Cindy Brady  Really?  Coin  Coin city itself?  Coin city itself  Oh my god  I'm mute  Ah shit  Oh wow  This is too funny  That's all the thing of all day  I know  That's all I was thinking  All last night  That today  That's why I'm just  Coin city itself  Because it doesn't make any sense  Coin city itself

[03:35:00]  Wow that was a big girl  She fucking gave up  Big girl  Big girl  What a fatty  Hey uh  We don't have to  We got some Tyra audio  It's quick  We got three quick clips  Want to do this before we get out of here  What's she doing  Well Tyra  We brought it to everyone's attention  That she likes to make everything about herself  No matter what the topic is  Yeah no matter how tragic someone's story is  That they're telling  Instead of getting into the moment  That the person is conveying to Tyra  Tyra has to top the person 
[03:35:30]  Right  And say well I had something happen  When I was  Right  Blah blah blah  Well we were on vacation unfortunately  Because we would have had Ben Stiller  And Jack Black in studio  Promoting Tropic Thunder  But they went on Tyra's show  That's what Roland says by the way  I don't know if we would have got them in  I think we might have  Then again the movie doesn't need any help  So probably not  Tyra's show  We only talk to the people that  Have a project that needs help  Really need help  You can tell if the movie's gonna blow  If we're talking to the stars 
[03:36:00]  If we're talking to them  It's grossing $400,000 worldwide  Coin city itself  Oh Bob  Coin city itself  Straight to DVD  We do suck  That's great  First clip  Tyra talks about watching the movie  Tropic Thunder  And mentions that  Because she's also a producer  Her eye for film 
[03:36:30]  Is quite sophisticated  Oh is it?  What does she produce?  I can't believe the racist thing  I almost said  Oh wow  It almost came out  Dude  It was awful  Because I was like  I was at home  You know how you just yell stuff  At the TV  Yeah yeah  Oh my god  Here we go  So we all saw the whole movie  Didn't we?  I can't remember  It's awesome  You don't understand  It's funny  Because I'm a producer too  You know what I mean  I look at movies  And I'm like  Yeah  No editing's wrong 
[03:37:00]  This  I was like  In the chair  Leaning forward  Then like this  Oh my god  Really?  You like it?  That's good  What does she produce  Besides probably a bad odor  Out of her vagina  What?  Yeah  Has she produced anything  Worth mentioning?  What does she produce?  We're all technically producers  Exactly  Come on  I like to produce  A load of her cheeks  Coins  Coins  To yourself  Oh  Oh  It should be 
[03:37:30]  Coins  To yourself  The president  Her production credits  Include America's Next Top Model  The Tyra Bank Show  Australia's Next Top Model  That isn't producing like a movie  What a dumb fucking cunt she is  Stylista  Producer I 
[03:38:00]  We all did a movie together  Ben Stiller mentions Tyra  You got something in it?  No  Alright  Keep going  I'm just looking for how much money she makes  And what she is  But I can't see where I find it  Oh boy  Warning  Warning  Sealed  Alert  Sealed  Warning  Warning  Warning  Oh boy  I gotta do it  What?

Goddamn rich cunt  I kill rich cunt  It's all in the timing  He stinks  And I don't like him  I know Jimmy  In this next clip 
[03:39:00]  Ben Stiller mentions Tyra's pretty  Tyra tries to elongate that topic as long as possible  Oh I bet  Hey guys out there we can hear you in here please  And then interrupts the interview to discuss her makeup  You know what?  They don't get to participate anymore  Goodbye  Who the fuck is yapping  Who the fuck is yapping?  Who the fuck is yapping?  Who the fuck is yapping?  Yap, yap, yap  The Russian broad is holding court  Well tell everybody to shut up out there because the mics are now off  Hey shut up broad  God  Fuck 
[03:39:30]  Speaking of cunts  Your joke made me laugh  So that Kenny told me  Of course Kenny told me  It's an old joke you probably know  Of course it is  What do you say to a woman with two black eyes?  Nothing  She's already been spoken to twice  Coincidia self  Lippy  Coincidia self  A misogynist  That made me laugh so much 
[03:40:00]  Because he laughed when he told me  She's already been spoken to twice  That's a fucking funny joke  I don't think it's a stretch to say that you're the prettiest person in the movie by far  Thank you so pretty  No, my wife is in it  She's pretty too  And you're the only two women really in the movie  I'm like the second prettiest  No, no, you're like equally pretty  I don't understand  You're pretty in a totally different way  You're in trouble  You just dug yourself a deep hole 
[03:40:30]  My wife is really pretty  And you're like, you know, you're Tyra Banks  Your wife is like white pretty  And I'm black pretty  Exactly  But I have on so much makeup  No, you look good  Like I'm wearing more this season  Because my makeup artist says that I need more  Because it like  Why?

[03:41:00]  All right, whatever  Tyra gets cute  And as a surprise  Introduces to Jack Black and Ben Stiller  A Photoshop Tropic Thunder poster  With her face on it  Well, let me show everybody the poster  This is the poster  That's all around town  Every single place  Lovely, gorgeous poster  Yes  But your movie studio  They contacted me  Because they wanted to also reach  A really strong female audience  Right  Particularly the Tyra audience  Yes  And so this is another campaign  That they have coming out really soon
