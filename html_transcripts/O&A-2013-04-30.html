<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in crude sexual banter before transitioning to a discussion of Jason Collins' coming out as gay.  They displayed varying levels of indifference, questioning the news's significance and speculating on reactions within the NBA, referencing Charles Barkley and the differing perspectives on homosexuality within the black community and athletics.  The conversation included Chris Broussard's controversial comments on homosexuality and religious views, sparking a debate on freedom of speech and religious expression.  They also speculated about other closeted gay athletes.  This was followed by a discussion about a man losing $2600 at a carnival game, leading to speculation about rigged games and various scams.  The Jason Collins story continued, incorporating reactions from President Obama and Bill Clinton, and a brief jab at Hillary Clinton's perceived insincerity. The overall tone was irreverent and profane.

The show then moved to a discussion of "The Cowhead Show" and its $18 million lawsuit stemming from a photo of a child with Down syndrome paired with "Retarded News" on their website.  Opie, Anthony, and E-Rock criticized the euphemistic news coverage and predicted Cowhead's firing. This was followed by a discussion of the *American Psycho* Funny or Die parody featuring Huey Lewis and Weird Al, accompanied by graphic descriptions and vulgar language.  Studio guests included Mike Baker, a former CIA operative, and Nada Bakos, a subject of the HBO documentary *Manhunt*.  Music was played, and various anniversaries, including Vietnam War anniversaries, were mentioned. The Cowhead situation was revisited, interspersed with further off-color jokes and tangents.

The next segment focused on Sam, a radio personality passed over for a job at a new Entertainment Weekly radio channel despite positive feedback. Opie and Anthony expressed outrage, using highly offensive language, criticizing the hiring of inexperienced individuals, including a *Survivor* contestant.  The conversation devolved into vulgar comments about Gabby Douglas, Katherine Zeta-Jones, and Ronnie from *Jersey Shore*.  They launched a scathing critique of Entertainment Weekly’s decision-making and Scott Greenstein's management, complaining about broken promises and the magazine's influence.  Technical issues with on-air graphics were also noted.  Mike Baker returned to the studio.  The discussion shifted to Baker's experiences, the accuracy of *Zero Dark Thirty*, the hunt for Osama bin Laden, interrogation techniques, and women's roles in the intelligence community.  Baker discussed his career, his role in targeting Al-Zawahiri, the aftermath of bin Laden's death, and challenges of intelligence work and counterterrorism.  The segment ended with a discussion of Baker's post-CIA life and his views on 9/11 conspiracy theories, all interwoven with Opie and Anthony’s sexually explicit and offensive interjections.

A subsequent segment featured Neda Bakos, a former CIA analyst, discussing the challenges of finding Bin Laden in Tora Bora, counterterrorism in mountainous regions, and intelligence assessment.  She recounted an anecdote about a visit from Vice President Cheney.  The conversation moved to the Boston Marathon bombing, with Mike Bigger offering analysis on potential additional suspects, foreign influence, and media reporting.  Russia's potential role, Benghazi, drone strikes, and Obama's policies were also discussed.  The segment concluded with plugs for a Bin Laden documentary and stand-up comedy appearances, interspersed with off-topic banter about Idaho and a humorous attempt by Roland to pitch the owner of Modell's as a guest. Profanity and discussions of sensitive topics were prevalent.

The final segment heavily featured listener calls, initially focused on Modell's "Gotta go to Modell's" jingle.  A listener suggested the owner of Moe's Southwest Grill (mistaken for Modell's) as a guest, leading to a discussion about securing guests and potential trades.  The conversation shifted to 9/11 conspiracy theories, with a caller presenting an unconventional explanation about plane debris near the World Trade Center, prompting a debate on missing video footage and alternative explanations for the Pentagon attack.  Other tangents included Roland's jersey collection, upcoming show events (food court and "Taco Day"), and callers' personal anecdotes.  The show ended with a promotion for Steven Singer's gold-dipped roses, now available in Canada.  The overall tone was informal and crude, with frequent interruptions and humorous asides.  No studio guests were present during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio, Antonio, and now a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yes, they're entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls. 
[00:00:30]  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little.  What?  He's dang over here, don't listen to dang over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Woo!  Choo-choo. 
[00:01:00]  Hi.  Leaving the stitching.  Oh, yeah.  Nothing better than a good stretch.  You know?  Holy fuck.  That is good.  What's that about?  I don't know.  This feels fucking good.  It's got a fucking buildup, a payoff.  Oh, man. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  That is good shit right there.  Blowjob has his beak, though.  Ah.  Well, yes it does, Jim Norton.  Blowjob is greater than stretch.  You may be right.  But a good stretch is just a nice little pleasure.  Yeah.  In the morning.  Yeah.  So we got a gay guy in the NBA, huh?  Gives a fuck.  This is such a fucking...  Who cares?  It's the top story everywhere.  Right.  And who gives a shit?  Who cares? 
[00:02:00]  Why is this a story in this day and age?  A story?  Why the fuck is it even an issue?  Hey, he's gay.  Good.  Good for him.  Not good.  Good for him.  Fucking great.  Who gives a shit?  Like, who cares?  And it's okay for people to say not good, by the way.  Yeah, fine.  I think it's fine, and I also think...  I don't give a fuck.  As long as they don't do anything to fucking hurt his ability to, you know...  Do his job?  Enjoy his life, his career, anything like that. 
[00:02:30]  You could not like the gay lifestyle.  You could find it repulsive and disgusting, if you want.  That's fine.  But you know what?  You can't infringe on his rights in this country.  Or on his personal life.  As long as he's not, you know, pulling out his pecker during an NBA game because he can't  handle all the men around him.  And I think that's what a lot of anti-gay people think.  Of course that's what they think.  They think... 
[00:03:00]  Oh, and that's what they say.  That's what they say.  What they think, though, is that they're getting so turned on by gay men...  Right.  ...that they can't even look at them or know they're gay without somebody looking at them  and going, hey, are you gay?  Right.  Me and Ann were discussing the whole locker room thing because they're like, well, you know,  I'm going to be uncomfortable in the locker room knowing there's a gay guy in there.  Yeah.  If you're a real guy, you don't give a fuck.  Who cares?  You don't care.  Plus, they're already there anyway, whether you like it or not.  Thank you.  And that's what Charles Barkley said last night.  Bravo.  We're getting the clip. 
[00:03:30]  So Barkley basically was saying, look, there's been, you know, we all played with gay players.  We all know there's gay players.  Yeah.  But, you know, that's their business, so we never got into their business.  It's not up to us to, you know, give you a list of who's gay in the NBA.  Who's the gay?  But we all have played with NBA gay players.  Yeah.  So this isn't really that big of a deal after all.  No.  It's just sad that the guy's Jason Collins, and, you know, a lot of people saying he's brave to do this. 
[00:04:00]  Sort of.  I mean, he's at the end of his career.  Yeah.  And I believe he's been released by the Wizards.  Was his last team?  And there's a very good possibility he's not going to be playing next year.  Mm-hmm.  This might be it for him.  So, you know, technically he's an active player announcing he's gay.  But, you know, he absolutely waited to pretty much the end of his career because he wasn't brave enough to come out in his prime.  That's got to be a tough place to come out, too.  Fucking show business is one thing where everybody's understanding.  But the athletes, man, there's a different mentality. 
[00:04:30]  Athletes don't understand.  Yeah.  There's a, especially in the black community, there's just this big thing about gay that isn't really accepted as much in the black community.  And obviously a lot of athletes are black guys.  So you get this fucking environment of, of ear.  Well, the NBA, too, because a lot of, you know, there's a lot of, you know, I don't want to say thugs.  They're not thugs.  They're just, but they're guys that came up in fucking. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  In those neighborhoods.  And like, those are the guys you're hanging out with.  Exactly.  And that's probably not a very comfortable place to go.  You know, guys, sit down.  I want to share.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's probably not the easiest group of guys to do it.  You're not going to get like, oh, we sympathize.  You're going to get, damn, you did something.  Motherfucker.  I think in general, if you have a neck tattoo, you might be against the gay.  The gay.  In general.  In general.  In general.  But this always stirs up this big thing.  And I don't know. 
[00:05:30]  I just don't even think it's necessary.  Just let people fucking, you know.  At this point, it shouldn't be necessary.  But for some reason, it still is.  Being gay is such a personal thing.  Aside from the flamboyant, which is obviously the minority.  The flamboyant fucking wearing the assless chaps and fucking on one of those Halloween parade floats.  Well, that's why they got to clean up their own community, though.  Because that gives them a bad name.  It does.  It does.  We have talked about that.  You're right.  That is the minority. 
[00:06:00]  But that's what's pushed out there, usually.  Right, right.  The gay pride parade is, wow, is that a freak show, huh?  Yeah.  But for the most part, it's a personal thing that, you know, people, you might know that  they're gay, but you couldn't just on the outside see from the way he works or the way,  you know, he fucking drives his car or whatever.  So who gives a fuck?  Who cares?  It's like commuting and finding out that there's gays around you also commuting. 
[00:06:30]  Gay drivers.  Ah, you.  Why, I oughta, yeah.  The gay commuter.  Yeah.  The commuter.  This fucking car's right up my ass the whole time.  Right.  Whoa, whoa, that figures.  There's gay guys all over the road.  Yeah, yeah.  And they can't help themselves, and they're nude as they drive, you know, to work.  Yes, yes.  Wow, look at them.  Oh, they're out there.  Fuck.  So stupid.  It is.  Really, it's just dumb.  It doesn't make any sense. 
[00:07:00]  And people are saying they're going to be relentless to him on the road.  Yeah.  But the problem is, I think he might just about be done.  Is he done?  He might squeeze another year out.  Maybe.  Like, who cares?  Maybe, but, you know, this could be it for him anyway.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Can't wait to play the Barkley Clips.  He was great on Anderson Cooper last night.  He really was.  Oh, Anderson Cooper.  He basically said, there's been gay players in the NBA, and we all know it.  Yeah.  They already know it. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Always has been, he said.  Yeah, there's been gay guys in all sports forever.  The guys that play with them, for the most part, know.  Once the guys come out, though, the fear of being outed is probably not as, the threat of being outed is probably not as great.  It wants a few guys.  Yeah?  Yeah, especially in sports like football and basketball.  Baseball is a sport, but it's just not.  You expect the gay to be in baseball, right? 
[00:08:00]  The gay.  Less, I would say more so than football or basketball, yeah.  Even though that may be silly of me, but for some reason, I think it would be harder for someone in football or basketball.  I don't know why I think so.  Yeah.  And on the other end of the spectrum, I guess a lot of people are getting, not a lot of people, but who's that guy from ESPN?  He's catching some shit for what he said.  Broussard or something like that, right?  Chris Broussard, right? 
[00:08:30]  Now, if you're going to allow people their religious ideology and accept, you know, the holidays, accept what they believe in, religious freedom,  then if you ask a religious person what they think about gays and they give you an answer you don't like, well, tough shit.  First of all, you ask them.  Secondly, that's part of their religion.  I know gays don't like hearing it.  I know a lot of progressives don't like hearing about religion at all and shit, but the fact of the matter is, 
[00:09:00]  if you're adhering to a certain religion and that religion says, and you've even interpreted that religion to say that we don't accept gays,  then that's just as good as I fucking have to eat unleavened bread and I fucking, you know,  I have to do the sign of the cross there when I fucking kneel or something.  But it's just part of the religion.  So if they don't want to like it, and again, doesn't mean you have to be accepting or you like it,  but, you know, you can't let your religion affect the way the guy lives his life. 
[00:09:30]  But you don't have to accept it.  You don't have to like it.  You don't have to be this guy that has to say that we love, you know, we love the gay lifestyle.  Is there an actual clip or was it in an article?  Yeah, there is a clip.  It's Chris Broussard from ESPN.  You want me to watch it now?  Yeah, let's see what that is.  He released a statement overnight, by the way.  Did he?  Oh, yeah, he's panicking.  Yeah.  He's panicking.  Oh, of course.  He's seeing his fucking career go up.  This morning on the eastbound side between Randall Aveliwick. 
[00:10:00]  But again, these guys do have the right to their opinion, even though I think it stinks.  If you're religious and you don't like gay people, I think you're kind of a douche.  But you can't punish people because they don't, as long as it doesn't affect how he does his job, you can't punish him for feeling that way.  I said what he said was absolutely ignorant.  People are like, ignorant, it's in the Bible.  Exactly.  Yeah, you got to kind of fucking, if you're going to respect other people's goofy religions, you got to accept that part of it, too. 
[00:10:30]  And that's kind of what he said in his statement.  He didn't apologize for what he said.  He apologized for it becoming an issue.  But these people aren't living a perfect religious lifestyle, by the way.  As they say, it's in the Bible.  They're breaking rules left and fucking right.  But this is one rule they especially don't like.  So they point that one out.  In this country, we like accepting, a lot of people like accepting the fact that Muslims enjoy blowing things up for their religion.  It's accepted by many people in this country, apparently. 
[00:11:00]  They don't say we can't talk about it.  Don't fucking, don't lump them all into one category.  Don't say that they're violent.  Don't jump to conclusions.  Don't jump to conclusions.  I got a gay disc right here, so this is perfect.  All the gay stuff right here on one disc.  Nice, the gay disc.  The gay disc.  Chris Broussard explains to ESPN that homosexuality and premarital sex is against Christianity. 
[00:11:30]  Okay, all right.  All right, so a lot of us sinned by having sex before marriage there, right?  Very, very sinning over here.  People are sinning all over the fucking place.  So what are you talking about?  Very sinning.  He mentioned in his article, Jason, that he is a Christian as well.  So what's your take on that?  Well, personally, I don't believe that you can live an openly homosexual lifestyle or an openly premarital sex between heterosexuals.  If you're openly living that type of lifestyle, then the Bible says you know them by their fruits. 
[00:12:00]  It says that, you know, that's a sin.  And if you're openly living in unrepentant sin, whatever it may be, not just homosexuality, adultery, fornication, premarital sex between heterosexuals, whatever it may be,  I believe that's walking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ.  So I would not characterize that person as a Christian because I don't think the Bible would characterize him as a Christian. 
[00:12:30]  There you go.  The guy should absolutely not be fired.  Not at all.  He was asked his opinion.  You might not agree with what he had to say, but, you know, certainly he has the right to say it.  This is a prime example of freedom of religion and freedom of speech right there.  Yeah.  Prime example of the ability to say something that offends certain people, but you have the right to say it and should not be penalized for saying it.  And he didn't he didn't he didn't blast the guy and he didn't say anything.  The guy's terrible.  He said, hey, premarital sex, all that. 
[00:13:00]  So he kind of lumps it all into the same category.  The Bible says it's a sin, so I say it's a sin.  You want to burn in hell for the pleasures of your cock?  Exactly.  So up to you, my friend.  You want to make a three-pointer and then sink that larger than average thing into the hiney of another gentleman?  You can talk to God about it.  But he has the right to say that, even though I think it's silly, but he's got the right.  Of course he does.  Why is there any shit being given?  Why?  Why do we fucking cry about people not being honest?  Oh, and then when the guy's honest, we allow him to we hang him out to dry, hang him out 
[00:13:30]  to dry.  Yeah.  One guy on Twitter is like, I hope is, you know, I don't agree with what he had to say  and I hope his bosses fire him.  Oh, why would you even?  No, you don't want that.  You don't want that because eventually, you know, they're going to go after something that  you are passionate about.  Would you prefer that he lies?  Yeah.  We would prefer he lies.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  He gave a bullshit answer.  Typical American.  I don't want that.  Why aren't politicians honest?  Why does everybody lie? 
[00:14:00]  Here's an example.  Right now, the guy telling the truth.  Yeah.  And you want him fired for it.  That's the truth.  I think he I think he stinks for the way you feel.  Absolutely.  I think he's a douche.  I think the biblical shit makes me sick, but he's got the right to feel the way.  You know, it would have been a great answer for him right there.  So what's your take on it?  I'd love to tell you my take on this, but I can't because there's a bunch of babies and hypocrites  out there that could possibly get me fired for my thoughts on this.  So you know what?  I'm going to pass. 
[00:14:30]  You know what?  We're heading toward that world.  Yes.  Where that would be the answer.  We're kind of in that world already.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, we are.  We're kind of in that world because, you know, this is a huge headline because only everyone  once in a while someone actually steps up and goes, all right, you want to know  my opinion?  Here it is.  Yeah.  Here it is.  You're not going to like it, but here it is.  Yeah.  You're right.  I mean, when fucking, you know, Sal came out as being gay, I didn't care.  I didn't either.  Who cares?  Sal's a good guy.  You know, and he didn't even have to say it.  He just fucking, you know, got in his underwear and felt up a gay man right here in the studio. 
[00:15:00]  I wonder why he had a wizard's jersey.  I don't even think about it.  He still does his job.  Right.  He still does his shitty job.  Right.  There you go.  He does his job very shittily.  Being gay, he couldn't do it any worse.  Yes.  Straight gay.  He still does his shitty job.  See, nothing has changed with Sal.  That's right.  Then you had Charles Barkley on CNN with Anderson Cooper. 
[00:15:30]  What was your reaction?  Well, the first thing, I was happy for Jason because, you know, people should get to be who  they want to be.  But knowing there's a gay player in the NBA, I think anybody who'd think they'd never play  with a gay player is an idiot.  I played with several gay players.  It's their own business.  And I think they should get to be who they want to be.  I think that's the first time I've ever heard an athlete say that.  Yeah.  Bravo.  He's played with gay players.  I mean, and he knows that every fucking player out there knows that they played with gay players. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Good for you, Barkley.  There was rumors.  And this is a rumor I heard years ago.  Do you remember years ago when Robbie Alomar spit in the umpire's face?  I remember at the time there was a rumor.  And I really, I don't know, I think he's been married since then.  He might have been bullshit.  Right.  That he was gay.  And the rumor was that the umpire had said something really anti, some nasty slur.  And then Robbie had spit in his face. 
[00:16:30]  Because you remember that that went away.  Like, he got in trouble for it, but not the kind of trouble you'd expect someone to get in for spitting in an umpire's face.  They might have had a closed-door meeting.  Like, look, this is why I did what I did.  Yeah.  And that, again, that might be total bullshit.  Right.  But that's the only time I've ever heard of it in baseball.  Even rumored.  Yeah.  Did I cover bases well on that?  Yes.  Yes.  I don't think I've ever heard an athlete come out and say what Barkley has said, that we played there.  I thought that was very interesting.  And then Barkley continued.  Charles, do you think the fans are ready for this? 
[00:17:00]  I mean, do you think the sport is ready for this?  You know, I think your question is great because Doc Rivers says something today.  I think he's going to be at peace in the locker room.  I think we as jocks have gotten a bad rap for a lot, for a lot of years.  I've heard all these talking heads for the last few years talking about these guys will be uncomfortable.  In the locker room, first of all, they're going to be safe in the locker room.  We've all played with gay guys.  We're going to welcome them with open arms.  I think society is more homophobic than teens in locker rooms. 
[00:17:30]  The thing that's going to be interesting to me, I think it's all right for guys to disagree or say they don't like gay people.  That, to me, is going to be the great debate.  I've been pro-gay marriage for a long time.  But right now, if anybody comes out and say they don't, they're uncomfortable with a gay teammate, they're going to get crucified.  He's right, too.  I think that's unfair.  I think this is going to open up a great debate.  Hopefully, some more guys will come out. 
[00:18:00]  If they want to be free, they deserve to be free.  But I think that's going to be the interesting dynamic of this whole thing, Anderson, because obviously some people are uncomfortable around gay people, and they should be able to say that.  That is absolutely right.  Some smart stuff there.  Did Charles come out as a grammar assassin?  Did he technically come out and say it, that he hates grammar?  Holy shit.  You know what, though?  Charles is a no-bullshit cut-to-the-chase guy. 
[00:18:30]  Well, he certainly is.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Maybe he's right.  You know what?  None of us are into a team.  Maybe he's right.  Maybe in the locker room it's not what we think.  You know, maybe it's part of it, but maybe players know so much more than we think they know.  Just suiting up, sucking each other's dicks.  Yeah.  I mean, if we, like, they know it.  Obviously, you're playing with a guy all that time.  Absolutely.  They know it.  They see who he's leaving with at the end of the war.  Absolutely.  He's bringing a friend on the road.  Who he's not leaving with. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  He's fucking, yeah.  Pictures in the locker.  Yeah.  Just open it up.  It's fucking just.  Yeah, but his pictures are like Kareem, so they can't say anything.  Like, well, he's a ball player.  Yeah, so maybe they haven't, because you really haven't heard anybody blasting.  You haven't heard them outing, even secretly outing people on teams.  They haven't been doing that to each other, so.  All right.  And then Mike Francesa.  Oh.  What did Mike have to say?  Well, he had this to say.  I really don't care. 
[00:19:30]  It means less than nothing to me that there is a gay player now out in the NBA.  SI going to reveal this this week.  And I don't know why.  I guess a, you know, dramatic attempt to sell a magazine, I guess.  I guess.  I guess.  He's sort of getting in a little trouble for that sound clip right there.  But he's downplaying it.  Saying that they're doing it just to sell magazines.  Oh, really?  But in a way, you know, it is going to sell a lot of fucking magazines. 
[00:20:00]  That's the same reason we're talking, is to sell.  That's the same reason he's talking.  And that's the same reason every newspaper is printed.  Right.  Yeah, it's commerce.  Stupid ass home.  Obviously, that's why they're doing it.  That's why anybody does anything.  Right.  He's got the gay face.  Yeah.  Oh, we brought up the fact that our old intern slash employee, Spaz, from years ago, from  NEW, used to do a bit about how he could tell that people were gay just by looking at them  because, as he said, they had the gay face. 
[00:20:30]  The gay face.  And you look at the picture of this guy.  Absolutely.  Dude, he's got the gay face.  Well, yes.  Why did the picture?  Spaz would certainly say that.  It's very soft and tender and smiley and sensitive.  They should have showed him playing in one of those moments where a fucking NBA player  is like, that's what they should have showed.  That's the other side of this.  He doesn't really have many moments on the court.  Oh, no?  Not a lot of people are talking about Jason Collins and his skills in the NBA. 
[00:21:00]  They still should have showed that picture.  I think he averaged around three, three and a half points a game, something like that.  Oh, no.  Did he?  Oh, yeah.  He's not that great.  He's been around a while, but played for the Nets and no one even knew.  So, whatever.  Just a picture of him crashing up against the border, doing something that, like, that's  because that's what you don't expect.  Like, this is the face of a guy smiling with his hands up.  It's like a fucking portrait.  Like, that guy's gay. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, okay.  I can kind of tell.  I would never put my hand up like that for a photo.  Under your chin?  No.  Under my balls.  But they should show him doing something that's not a stereotypically soft, gentle...  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Yeah, that would be more the stereotypical florist or interior decorator shot than a basketball player.  Show him doing a basketball player thing, and then people will go, wow, I looked at  that guy, and I never would have thought. 
[00:22:00]  I guess I can't judge him.  You know, right now you're looking at it going, yeah, I get it.  Yeah, I'm sure he's gay.  Oh, he plays ball?  Okay.  Yeah.  The story is because he's a basketball player, so show him playing basketball.  More Francesa.  Yes.  I mean, we all realize that there are plenty of gay people in America.  You've got to figure some of them are playing sports.  Sports.  The fact that they don't feel comfortable enough to come out, we now have to force them out  or push them to come out. 
[00:22:30]  I mean, so, or whatever reason, but now we have a player in Jason Collins.  Who has been a, you know, a journeyman player in the NBA.  Now admitting, as he looks to stay in the league, and now if he doesn't stay in the league,  it will all be considered that he's been run out of the league.  But admitting now that, or at least now, coming forward with the fact that he is homosexual.  Why?  I have no idea. 
[00:23:00]  I guess you'll have to read the story.  I guess I will when I get a chance.  I mean, I have the story here.  I'm not compelled to run and talk about it or read it.  I really don't care.  I can't be any more honest.  I don't care.  He makes a good point there.  I believe he's been released, so if another team doesn't pick him up, yeah, people are  going to go, well, the reason was because he's gay.  They didn't want him on their team.  Meanwhile, he's pretty much on his way out, you're saying? 
[00:23:30]  Odds, yeah.  Odds are pretty good that he might not be playing next year if he does.  Did Iverson retire, by the way?  Yeah.  He did, okay.  Well, then he came back, and I think he's finally retired, retired, I believe, yeah.  Why did you mention Iverson?  I just thought of him before when I was thinking of tattooed players, and I just mentioned him  now.  I just wonder what happened to him.  I wonder, I understand things like gay people having a problem coming out in public because 
[00:24:00]  of the stigma put on them, whatever.  But I think when they say they have a problem coming out to their parents and stuff, that's  an odd thing to me, because it would have to boil down to a personal shame of what you're  doing and what your lifestyle is, that you can't go privately to your own parents or your  family.  Because a lot of gays say, oh my God, the biggest thing that I've heard is, do you know  how difficult it is for a gay person to come out to their family? 
[00:24:30]  Well, society did that, though.  But isn't that your own image of gayness and your being gay and gay lifestyle, that  you have this shame that you can't even come out to your parents about it?  Like, where does that part come from?  And it's different than coming out in public.  You know.  Parents are probably harder.  I'm guessing that they're harder.  But why?  I had to throw in I'm guessing.  But if gays are so, like, want everybody to accept gays and be accepting and they 
[00:25:00]  themselves are proud of being gay and stuff, then why is it such a problem to come out  to your parents and loved ones?  Now, I can understand the public thing because of the stigma.  But privately, it has to boil down to your own personal shame of the lifestyle.  It's easy to say that now.  But now, you know, go on a time machine and say that exact same statement in 1993. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  There was a lot of shame in society.  And that probably played into your own fucking head.  Plus, you have old school parents that never, you know, understood, you know, they didn't  even understand the Beatles.  They're going to understand that you put your dick in some man's ass.  You know what I mean?  But until, I know, I don't know if I'm fucking.  I don't know, but it's a shame.  I understand what you're saying.  And I think it is becoming easier.  Yeah.  But we only got to this place very recently where there's a lot less shame associated 
[00:26:00]  with it.  Yeah.  And I don't even know if it's.  Society shame, I'm just saying.  If it's shame or you're afraid of how your parents are going to react.  Like, even if you feel good about yourself.  Yeah.  To people, their relationship with their parents is very important.  And if you know that your father feels a certain way or your mom or whatever feels a certain  way about something, even if you feel okay with it and you can go, yeah, I'm going to  live this way, knowing that you may do damage to your relationship with your parents or that  they may feel something, even though you feel good about it, it still may be a difficult  thing to do.  So then how could you assume or how could you expect society, people that don't even know 
[00:26:30]  you or care about you, to be accepting if you don't even think your fucking parents  are going to be accepting?  Well, you can expect it and want it and demand it.  It doesn't mean it.  What do you mean?  It's like you, you, just because you know people aren't going to be accepting, you don't  want to be, uh, you don't want people telling you you can't do anything.  No, you could know people aren't going to be accepting, but you can't expect people to  be accepting.  If you, if you have doubts over your own loved ones, you can't expect people to be accepting.  You can't gain acceptance by just saying, accept me. 
[00:27:00]  You know what I mean?  That's true.  Like it's very, it's, it's such a weird position to be put in as, as a nation and as public.  I think a lot of people don't have open-minded parents.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just don't.  Yeah.  I'm just playing.  I'm, I'm, I'm playing both sides here.  You talk about your dad a lot, right?  Sure.  Was he an open-minded guy though?  No.  So, you know, no. 
[00:27:30]  So if that was you, yeah, you would have had an easy time telling your pops in his words.  If I came home with a faggot or a nigger, I was dead.  Dead.  So what are you talking about in your own, in your own family?  You understand it.  Yeah.  And you're not like that.  Like as much shit as you talk, as much nonsense as you talk, you don't care about gay people.  Like you, I mean, meaning you're not homophobic.  You don't, you don't dislike gay people.  No.  But I, dad was batting 50 with a, batting 500 with what he said. 
[00:28:00]  But Ann, I think you're answering your own question.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  But there's a lot of people that have parents like, like your dad.  So how the fuck are they going to, you know, tell their, their father they're gay?  But, but then how could I expect anything less from anyone else?  You know, I, I, I.  Maybe you're right in like, hey, how can you?  Because at home it's like that.  But, you know, you understand that.  You're, that's a great point.  Your, your dad.  Right.  Like if you were gay, you couldn't, even if you love your dad and you admire him and, you know, but you know, that's how he was. 
[00:28:30]  You couldn't tell him.  You son of a bitch.  Oh man.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  So you, you can expect society.  Because don't forget, I think the word acceptance is overused.  Yeah.  I think the problem is not, we need to be accepted.  People need to like her.  It's, the bottom line is people are legislating.  We're fighting for people to be able to live the way they want to live. 
[00:29:00]  Uh huh.  I think if, if there was no, if, if the rights were equal across the board.  Yeah.  I don't think people would be talking about his acceptance as much because it was like, hey, I can do what I want.  I can marry who I want.  I can, I can get the same benefits as everybody else.  So how you feel about it is valueless to me.  But there are two schools of thought there.  There is the business angle, the very technical slide rule business angle of this guy does this job, so we'll give him this much money and stuff, no matter if he's gay or what. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Then there's the personal, more artistic angle, which is I don't like gay people or I like gay people.  I guess the word is more than acceptance is tolerance because you have to tolerate things.  You don't necessarily like it, but you got to live with it and you got to deal with it and you can't hold it back or anything.  So, but, but the thing is to, to, I don't know, I don't think it could be expected to have people accept you.  Of course not.  You know?  Of course not.  But I think that's, that's what a lot of civil rights groups, a lot of, um, uh, gay rights groups and stuff that they're going for. 
[00:30:00]  They're going for a world where they are looked at and, and like everyone else accepted based on their merits.  But there are people that just hate fucking gay people.  Right.  It's crazy.  I completely agree with you.  But yeah, I think it's a fair thing to want in America.  I think it's fair because we are so busy telling everybody else about human rights and about living a certain way.  We have the right to demand that of our own government.  You can't tell people how to, how to write or feel though. 
[00:30:30]  And how to like somebody and not like somebody.  And the fact is there are a lot of people that still are not accepting of this lifestyle.  Yeah.  Which is so silly.  Just to get the Jason Collins info.  I don't know if I said he was released.  If I did, I was wrong.  He's a free agent.  Free agent.  Which is a little different.  So, you know.  So he doesn't, he doesn't really have a contract.  Yeah.  Like he's looking for, you know, his next team or to be re-signed by the Wizards.  And I think if people could govern without their personal feelings getting involved, I don't think this whole acceptance thing would be a problem. 
[00:31:00]  It's almost like if people's personal dislike of gays and that lifestyle didn't dictate the way they voted or didn't dictate the way they voted or the way they passed policy, then it wouldn't be an issue.  But that, unfortunately, is not the way, that's where acceptance means something.  And we were talking about Obama because Obama, you know, tweeted or, you know.  He actually called him on the phone.  Oh, he called him.  Okay.  Like a nice little rah-rah, good for you type thing. 
[00:31:30]  But the fact is, Obama only accepted the gay very recently.  Yeah.  Well, he's another one.  His religion.  I would love to know what he really thinks because I think he does it for votes.  The Reverend Wright fucking liked gay people?  No.  I don't think so.  I think Obama was pro-gay, and I think that Biden inadvertently fucking said that before the election.  He was pro-gay.  If he's pro-gay, why didn't he say it a lot sooner than he did?  Yeah.  He had four years to say it.  Because he's worried about votes.  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  Sure.  So what's real? 
[00:32:00]  Is he pro-gay or not?  What's real?  Good luck.  I think what they do in the second term, what they say in the second term is probably more real because they don't have to fight for the election as much.  And it's too bad that they have to think that way.  Yeah.  But as we see, you know, you speak the truth, and they want your fucking head.  So it's a weird world we fucking live in.  Yeah.  Bill Clinton supports Jason Collins because Chelsea went to school with Jason Collins.  Oh, really?  So Mr. Clinton probably knew way before most that Jason Collins was gay. 
[00:32:30]  How's that twinkle toast doing?  Yeah.  Every time Chelsea would come back after a basketball game, Bill would pure all her hands.  And Clinton turned around.  I don't think Clinton was ever that against gays either.  Again, these guys are all trying to balance what's going to fuck me in the voting and where can I be honest?  You know, Clinton doesn't give a fuck.  Yeah.  He doesn't hate gay people.  So America doesn't want to be talked to honestly, I guess.  No.  No.  We hate honesty.  Because we attacked Hillary Clinton for wearing a different baseball hat every other fucking week, depending on what city she was in. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  She liked what?  The Chicago Cubs, the Mets?  I'm a Cubs fan!  She liked the Cubs...  Really?  She liked the Cubs...  Go Yankees!  No, she liked the Cubs, the Mets, and the Yankees.  Yeah.  And we all accepted, like, okay, cool.  But, you know, if she came out and just said, I'm a Cubs fan because I'm from there or whatever the fuck...  You'd respect her more.  I'm not going to vote for anyone based on their fucking sports teams. 
[00:33:30]  But she felt like that's the way to play that.  Yeah.  Because, you know, if you say you're a Yankees fan, and, you know, that means you're going to...  She's a giant phony.  That one.  There it is.  The Yankees and the Cubs hats.  Yes.  She's a phony.  A phony baloney.  Well, she's going to run.  Yeah.  Who are going to be the big ones?  You got Clinton and maybe...  I think she's going to run.  She's a little old, man.  And Governor Christie.  They're hinting that she's going to run.  Yeah, Governor Christie might, though.  What do them lady parts have to do with getting old in the presidency, huh? 
[00:34:00]  What about that?  Menopause.  Are we good with a menopausal president?  I don't know.  What about that dried up old uterus?  Does that do anything?  I know a guy, you know, they fucking have their nuts and shoot jizz and shit like that.  Right up until they drop dead.  A woman, though?  Ooh, those ovaries.  Like sun-made raisins in there.  Just trying out.  Like a couple of dates. 
[00:34:30]  Let's see.  The only reason Obama sided with gay is because Biden forced him to.  Yeah, we said that.  He was too scared to say that.  I just hate that our politicians are too scared to say what they really fucking feel.  Which means...  It's ridiculous.  We are hateable as a public because we punish them for it.  Yeah, of course.  It's really sad.  Yeah, it's anybody.  We just punish them for honesty.  We ask for their opinion.  Yeah.  And then when they give it to us and we don't like it, oh, we lose our fucking minds. 
[00:35:00]  How fucking stupid is that?  We deserve what we get.  Every liar in office, we absolutely deserve.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, this ESPN guy, as much as I think what he said stinks, he should not get in any  trouble for it.  None.  None.  Not at all.  Not an iota of trouble.  And gay groups should finally, like GLAAD or any, and I know that they're fucking hardcore,  man, but they should really support this guy's right to say what he wants. 
[00:35:30]  Because I think that they missed the point on that.  Like, guys like that, he's not saying, I want gays killed and I want them out of the NBA.  Like, you would get more open dialogue and more honesty and you would turn more people  around on your opinion if you were more reasonable and they didn't feel pushed into a corner.  If GLAAD and groups like that were a little bit more reasonable with allowing people to  speak their mind without targeting them, more people would go like, all right, these are  guys just like the people I know.  Well, you know, it's, I think it would, uh, it make, it would make them as a group harder 
[00:36:00]  to feel discriminatory against.  Yeah.  If that makes any sense.  Yeah.  Cause it's that, that whole angle where, you know, you can't even say stuff like that.  That really gets like, you know, cause it turns, it makes people go, no, fuck you.  Like every, what I want.  Every joke, whether it was some studio head, this woman wanted all homophobic dialogue,  taken out of scripts.  It's like, shut the fuck up.  Great.  What are you doing?  Should we just have every interest group go over every script?  To make sure nothing's offensive in there and then see what spits out the other end? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  That crazy.  Let's see.  Well, the gay is, uh, the big story today.  It's unbelievable.  Everyone loves the gay.  It's on every fucking TV.  Yeah.  Uh, let's see.  And all these fucking news people, not so much the people reporting it, but the people  doing commentary.  Yeah.  Oh, they're all just doing the eggshell fucking tap dance.  Oh my God.  Everyone has the potential to get fired for what they say over this. 
[00:37:00]  So you'll just see these people really doing the old tap dance-a-rooney.  Goes back to our point.  They're scared shitless to, you know, say what they feel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As soon as you go a little too far, man, they come after you and then your bosses don't  fucking support you.  Right.  Period.  In the end, your bosses do not support you in this business.  No, no, no.  They'll-  The real time they used to.  They will fucking sell you out and let you go in a second.  Right.  Um, I saw this story in the middle of our conversation on The Gay on TV. 
[00:37:30]  A man lost his life savings playing carnival games.  What?  He deserves everything he gets.  No.  And I see him.  He's got this big stuffed-  What?  One of those dumb stuffed bananas.  That he's, like, pushing down the street?  Is that a banana with dreads and a fucking, like-  Rasta hat?  Rasta hat on?  What a horrible prize.  What happened?  To his credit, his life savings was $2,600.  $2,600. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  And he lost it.  Oh.  He lost $2,600 on carnival games?  What was he trying to win with his $2,600?  I guess a banana with rasta dreads.  Well, then mission accomplished.  Look at him walking down the street with his-  Man, he's got a kid.  He's got a kid.  Right.  Can I see this asshole?  You want to watch the story?  Yeah, let's watch the story, because I-  He won the kid?  Where's that carnival?  That's a good prize.  Uncle Paul, no, he won the banana.  Oh, this poor kid.  I know.  His dad spent $2,600 getting a fucking giant banana. 
[00:38:30]  What a carnival game.  He's growing up with an ass for a father.  Yes.  Yes.  Fucking idiot.  This is an unbelievable story, but it is true.  A New Hampshire man says his trip to the carnival was a horror show that left him out $2,600.  As New Hampshire Bureau Chief Michael Rosenfield shows us, the man says he was conned at a carnival  on a carnival game.  Conned.  Look at this asshole.  Come on.  He says he lost his life savings, $2,600, on a carnival game like this one, and all 
[00:39:00]  he has to show for it is this stuffed banana with dreadlocks.  Pause, pause.  You've got to be shitting me.  Get this on our Facebook page.  Hope you're in Anthony.  The banana's got to be fucking six and a half, seven feet tall.  Yeah, it's big.  That's a big goddamn banana, and it's got a giant Rasta hat and dreadlocks in the eyes.  But who doesn't know at this point that those games are really hard to win?  Of course they are.  You look at that and like, I don't understand why the fucking softball isn't going in the 
[00:39:30]  bucket.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  It keeps bouncing out.  The milk bottles are right there, but the ring won't go around the neck.  Everyone does it as a goof.  Like, all right, I know these are all rigged, but I'll give it a shot because it's kind of  fun.  Can you imagine the carny that was sitting there like, oh, you want three more balls?  Yeah, I did.  You do?  Okay.  All right.  Three more.  He probably fucking 300.  Maybe he fell into that scam.  Wait, 2,600.  How much do you think?  A buck?  Two bucks?  How much for three balls? 
[00:40:00]  Two dollars, say?  Probably two.  I don't know.  Maybe the story will tell us.  Five bucks.  You know what, though?  It might have been that scam thing where they just keep coming up and going, no, take  three more.  Three more.  Go ahead.  See if you can do it.  $2,600?  And then, but they keep giving like three balls and the guy throws it and he's like,  oh, so close.  Right.  And then he goes, dude, dude, here you go.  Here you go.  Right.  Throw it through.  And you whisper it almost like, look, here you go.  Right, right.  Try it again.  Try it again.  And it's like, oh, like it's free.  And then when you're done and you get ready to walk away, he goes, hey, hey, fella.  Right.  It's 2,600 bucks. 
[00:40:30]  2,600 bucks.  They Virgil'd him out of it.  Yes.  Who brings their life savings in cash to a carnival?  Well, I do, but.  Am I about his credit card?  No.  No, you can't use credit card.  I don't know, let's go back to the big reveal, because that could be one of the funniest  things.  I like how he described it.  In months.  This big banana.  And then they show it.  This is an unbelievable story, but it is true.  A New Hampshire man says his trip to the carnival was a horror show that left him out $2,600.  As New Hampshire Bureau Chief Michael Rosenfield shows us, the man says he was conned at a 
[00:41:00]  carnival.  Conned.  By a carnival game.  Don't con me.  Henry Gribom says he lost his life savings, $2,600, on a carnival game like this one.  And all he has to show for it is this stuffed banana with dreadlocks.  You're expecting to win a few things and, you know, let the kids have a good time.  It just didn't turn out that way.  Gribom says he attended a Manchester carnival run by Fiesta shows and wanted to win an Xbox 
[00:41:30]  Connect in a game called Tubs of Fun, where contestants toss balls into a tub.  When he practiced, he says it was easy, but something changed when he started playing for  the prize and the balls kept popping out.  It's not possible that it wasn't rigged.  Gribom says he kept trying to win back his money by going double or nothing.  He dropped $300 in just a few minutes, then says he went home to get $2,300 more and soon  lost all that as well. 
[00:42:00]  He has nothing to try about.  What a dumb motherfucker.  This guy is stupid.  Henry Gribom is stupid.  He went home to get more money?  Who does that?  He has zero fucking legs to stand on.  He could have went, lost the $300, went and bought an Xbox, and still had some money left  over.  Of course.  But he's an adult with a child, and after spending $300 on a carnival game, he still hasn't gotten  to the point that he's at now, which is this had to be rigged. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  But hey, how much did he think the giant banana with the dreads cost?  Wait, why'd you say Xbox?  Was he trying to win an Xbox?  Yeah, they said.  Oh, he was trying to win an Xbox.  They said he was trying to win an Xbox.  Oh, I thought he was trying for the giant banana.  How much did he cost Xboxes?  I don't know.  $300 or so.  $300 or so.  So he could have just bought it.  What if you don't?  Could have bought it.  For what he lost in the first place.  What an idiot.  But then I guess they were saying you could go double or nothing and win your money back. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, man.  They snucked him coming.  Is it legal to say double or nothing?  I don't know.  Oh, I guess he would get all his money back.  What did they do to the tub?  Okay, I got it.  Well, he gave him a job.  Hey, behind the board.  It's a tub.  Well, we got a guy on the line who used to run carnival games.  Really quickly.  Gary, what do they do with the fucking tub?  Hold on.  Before he does this, I need to put out the disclaimer.  He is the first caller of the day.  Right.  Which means what he says will be completely inaccurate and probably just an out-and-out lie and will be refuted by at least five or six callers to continue. 
[00:43:30]  Okay, thank you, sir.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Gary.  I love the intro.  You know, part of this has to be how shitty this guy can play.  I know when I ran a theme park, we ran about 30% cost of goods.  Disney on the phone.  You ran 30% what?  It was about a 30% cost of goods.  So that stupid banana probably cost the carnival about $40. 
[00:44:00]  So, you know, they take in $120, $150 for everyone that they give out.  So how shitty was this guy as a player that he had to spend $2,600?  But my question is simple.  He was playing, I guess, it's softballs into the bucket that's kind of tilted toward you.  Yeah.  It's almost, what would the angle be?  Yeah, it's not.  You get a little backspin on the softball.  You hit the front lip.  No, I understand.  I understand how you could possibly beat the game. 
[00:44:30]  You've got to, like, really barely get it into the lip and hope for the best when it rolls in with a little backspin.  I understand that part.  But what makes him bounce out so many fucking times?  Because if we put a regular bucket in here with a couple softballs, we're going to win most of the time.  Oh, bro, I could show you every single game where there's an angle.  Well, tell us how they do it.  That's what he's asking.  That's what my question is.  Thank you for not disappointing.  They're spring-loaded.  They're spring-loaded.  The softballs aren't regular softballs.  There's usually a rubber core in there that make them bounce all over the place. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, yeah.  And what's up with the bucket?  What's up with the bucket?  The bucket gives you maybe an eighth of an inch in diameter around.  It has to be a perfect throw.  No, no, no.  It's a big bucket.  Forget it.  The second guy will help us out.  Now, the question is...  Sam was absolutely fucking right.  We got conned into taking this call.  Like, absolutely right.  I love the first caller of the day.  Was the practice ball a regular softball, and then they give him a rubber ball middle?  Maybe.  No, they're all shooting.  Okay.  So, what is it about the bucket that makes the ball bounce right out? 
[00:45:30]  It's usually those milk jugs, and they're metal.  No, no.  No, it's not that game.  No.  It's not the big milk, metal, milk storage jug and softball.  It's a bucket.  It's a...  Yeah.  And the cardings know exactly how to do these games, so they're the ones that do it, and  showing you how easy it really is.  If the bucket was sitting on the floor, it would be easy.  Right.  You'd just throw it in. 
[00:46:00]  But it's turned on its side, and it's barely, like, the ball almost rolls out anyway.  It's a weird angle.  Yeah.  The angle's maybe 10 degrees, 15 degrees, would you say, right?  There's springs behind...  It's nailed to...  That might be right.  ...bywood with springs behind it.  It bounces right out.  But wouldn't you hear, like...  Wouldn't you hear, like, boing?  Wouldn't you hear a noise?  Boing, yeah.  What is this?  Three stooges playing?  Not every spring has the boing sound.  Like a boner.  Everyone would be going, who's got a boner? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  I hear bo-yo-yo-ing.  All right.  Let me...  Thanks, Gary.  Let me go to the second caller.  All right.  Second caller.  All right.  This is Chris in Canada.  Chris, please just explain the softball thing.  It's a plastic bucket.  And, Chris, could you please start by saying, that last caller was an asshole.  Yeah, he was a total asshole.  There you go.  Thanks.  The thing is, what they do is, you might miss the first shot, but when they throw...  You throw that first ball in, the guy will throw another ball in.  As soon as you throw your ball in, it will absorb the impact of the first ball and stays 
[00:47:00]  in.  So when you throw your practice shots, your ball will actually stay in.  But when you throw it and there's no other balls in the bucket, they bounce out.  Oh, wow.  So having a ball in there...  Oh, yeah.  Absorbs everything.  Wait.  I'm confused, but every time I've played, there was never a ball in there when I was practicing.  Somebody take them out or something.  To show how easy...  Huh?  Anytime I've been out there, the guy always...  He throws a ball in first from his...  He's closer, obviously, to the bucket. 
[00:47:30]  And, you know, then he leaves that ball in and he says, he tosses you a ball.  Here, you try one.  See how easy it is.  Oh, wow.  What a nice trick that is.  So maybe the ball...  Most of us don't even realize that.  The ball hits the other ball instead of the spring-loaded back, right?  Yeah, exactly.  And is it spring-loaded?  And why no boing sound?  Boing.  I'm asking for Jimmy.  I'm asking for Jimmy on that one.  Boing.  I played a carnival game once.  Oh, Chippa?  Yeah, it was like there was little water bottles standing up and there was no, like, lids on them. 
[00:48:00]  And it was from 50 feet away and you had to throw a basketball and make it land perfectly on top of the water bottle and stay.  Yeah?  How'd you do?  I lost a lot of money.  It was $50 a ball.  That really sounds impossible.  Yeah, it was really far.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like 60 feet.  You had to throw it and make it land just on top of it and stay.  Jesus.  Could it bounce on the ground a few times? 
[00:48:30]  No, no bouncing.  It had to land directly on the water bottle.  Come directly down.  Empty water bottle with no cap on it.  How many people would fucking play that?  One guy.  Impossible.  Because he kept knocking over the water bottles and the guy would be like, eh, next player.  Oh, my God.  But it was just me.  Everyone's saying there's a ball in the bucket that you just don't realize because the guy does it and then leaves the ball in there.  Uh-huh.  Very interesting.  And then we got a guy from Rochester because the other guy hung up.  Alex in Rochester, anything to add to the bucket thing? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  They leave.  When they give you a practice, they leave a ball instead.  So when you throw a ball, it stays in.  But when you pay money, there ain't no ball in there.  So every time you throw it, it bounces back.  Why don't we notice that?  I don't know.  How dumb are we?  Because you can't see it the way they have it.  Everyone is saying that.  Plus, you're not looking for that, though.  But it is tilted in a way where you're standing, you wouldn't see the ball in there.  That's true, too.  So then he goes in there and grabs the balls out, and now you've got an empty bucket with the boing-boing thing. 
[00:49:30]  Boing.  Yeah, that's right.  All right, Alex.  Thank you.  Alex.  Can we see the rest of the story?  Oh, sure, yeah.  So the guy lost his life savings, $2,600, trying to win an Xbox first kit.  Dope.  Don't start.  This is unbelievable.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  It's impossible that it wasn't rigged.  Gribbom says he kept trying to win back his money by going double or nothing.  He dropped $300 in just a few minutes, then says he went home to get $2,300 more and soon lost all that as well. 
[00:50:00]  I know it's a difficult game.  I mean, I've tried it myself.  I've done it once, missed probably 20 times.  Fiesta Show says the game is run by an independent contractor who's worked for Fiesta for years.  It's interviewing the contractor to see what happened.  Are there any scams at all with any of the games?  Not that I'm aware of.  We've had a lot of these game operators with us for years.  The traveling carnival is now setting up here in Derry, New Hampshire, but you will not see tubs of fun. 
[00:50:30]  Fiesta says the independent contractor that runs the game is not allowed to set up while an investigation is taking place.  Because you get caught up in the whole double or nothing, I've got to win my money back.  Henry says he went back the next day to complain, and the man running the game gave him back $600.  Henry split with the banana and the cash and filed a report with Manchester PD.  He has zero.  In my life, I happen to become that sucker.  In Derry, New Hampshire, Michael Rosenfield, WBZ News. 
[00:51:00]  Did they tell him to get the banana and carry it around with him and push it on the stroller?  He obviously wasn't coming back from the carnival right there.  So it's like, where's the banana?  We need some B-roll.  Could you just push it around your stroller with your kid?  Because that'll give the angle that you're a fucking idiot because you've got a kid and you spent that money.  And then have the banana because it's goofy.  And you know that was the safety.  Of course.  Because they did the whole interview without the banana.  Do you have that banana?  Just, I don't know.  We might use it.  We probably won't. 
[00:51:30]  Probably won't, but.  And they end up using it.  Natural-born sucker.  Yes.  And put on a shirt that shows your tits.  Could you do that, sir?  Right.  Little man titties.  What a dummy.  And he got back $600?  Well, sort of happy with that.  He grabbed the $600 and then filed a complaint.  He told the police.  Let's see what the newsreaders say after this.  They go back to the studio here.  There's a certain amount of persistence.  That's right.  And, you know, we'll see where this goes.  And a banana with dreadlocks.  How many people have that?  All right. 
[00:52:00]  Listen, we're truly sorry.  But I'm not sorry about the weather.  The weather.  We're truly sorry.  Why do you have to laugh into the weather?  I was enjoying you.  I'm not sorry about the weather, though.  I'm scared.  Don't say you're sorry.  You know he's a sucker.  Say it.  Say it on the news.  This guy's a dope.  What a dummy.  He's probably a compulsive gambler.  Do you think?  Do you think?  I bet $2,300 throwing a fucking ball into a bucket.  Yeah, he might.  That's a great fucking... 
[00:52:30]  Very insightful.  How did you not end up in the FBI?  I put pants.  The only guy is saying, why does this guy have his life savings at home?  Yeah, because it's $2,600.  It's not like it's been made through an investment.  You're pulling some huge interest off of that.  You can make some solid interest.  Half a percent on the $2,600.  I guess you're right.  You toss some balls in the buckets.  What the hell are you doing?  You spend a buck. 
[00:53:00]  You go get some cotton candy.  You head home with the kids.  Oh, you like the carnivals?  Yeah, you walk around.  You listen to a little music.  You smell some of the roasted peanuts.  There you go home.  Some of the simple pleasures, right?  Eh, just the simple pleasures.  Hey, you want a fried hot dog?  Eh, then we'll go home.  Take it easy.  You don't play any of the games?  Eh, I play a few bucks.  Oh.  You know, I bring 20 bucks.  20 bucks?  Yeah, split up.  Do you ever win?  Eh, not really.  Sometimes I want a small animal.  Eh, you give it to the kid.  What the hell do I know?  That's for you. 
[00:53:30]  What the hell do you know?  When I was your age, I had one.  Exactly.  What the hell do you know?  What a fucking dull, uneventful life regular Joe has.  But he doesn't seem to care.  No, he doesn't give a turkey.  Is our pal Cowhead in trouble?  He's probably nervous.  Oh, E-Rock.  Hello.  Is Cowhead in trouble?  Where were you, E-Rock?  Right here.  And if he is, this is more of a tease than anything else.  This is our Cowhead, right?  Yeah.  The guy we know?  Mm-hmm.  Fuck. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  There's your tease.  18 million.  Oh.  Whoa.  I don't even know what this story is, but that don't sound good.  No.  Well, we'll explain that next.  We also have Mike Baker in today.  Yes.  Former CIA operative.  Nada?  Backos?  Bakos?  Nada Bakos, I would go with.  You know, some have been lauding documentary, right?  Oh, I wish I would have known that she was coming in today, because I'm watching it.  I haven't finished watching it, but I've seen it, and I really love it. 
[00:54:30]  Ooh.  It's great.  Good.  Fuck!  I didn't realize she was into that one.  I would have finished it.  Yeah, I watched it.  Oh, you saw the whole thing.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  They get him.  Oh, good.  They get him, man?  Yeah.  Which one is Nada Bakos?  Do you bring up a picture of her, so I know which one?  Because there was a few women interviewed during the...  Is she one of the ones they interviewed, I hope?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, she's, uh...  Wait, who does she look like?  Caroline Kennedy.  I don't know.  She looks like...  Oh, I know who she looks like. 
[00:55:00]  You don't know her, though.  No, it's a woman named Becky Tetley.  She's the estranged wife of Bill.  Oh, man.  She was in 20 years in intelligence.  Yeah, this is a good...  It's on HBO May 1st.  It's called Manhunt, the inside story of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  And they, uh...  May 1st is tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  I believe.  So tomorrow on HBO. 
[00:55:30]  Women were much more a part of getting Bin Laden than they were giving credit for.  It's like...  And they say women make good analysts in the special.  And I think they do, because they just go over...  You know how fucking your girlfriend will fucking...  Oh, yes.  ...every fucking detail they gotta go over?  Yes.  Yeah, those analysts just sitting there.  All these women pawing through fucking data and information.  They targeted Bin Laden like he was a boyfriend, and they found a fucking phone number in his pocket.  Yes.  And that's how they got him.  Yes. 
[00:56:00]  Very funny.  Let's just go to break E-Rock.  Yeah.  It doesn't have to be all fucking...  Oh, fancy or schmancy.  Just hit the fucking thing.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  The OPNB Show continues in all this.  And now, these messages.  And it was dark.  So dark at night, night, night.  And we have long to enjoy. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, this big Vietnam song.  Brother to brother.  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  And we would all go down together.  Together.  We said we'd all go down together.  Why are you dissing Ant today?  E-Rock's dissing you today, Anthony.  What happened? 
[00:57:00]  Well, he's playing this because Nixon announced the U.S. was sending troops to Cambodia 43 years ago today.  Arr.  But he could have went with Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun committing suicide 68 years ago today.  Man.  That's not why I played it at all.  Oh.  Why?  This is the big Vietnam song.  Because Saigon fell to the communists 38 years ago.  Oh, all right.  Oh, is that it?  Iraq doing a little spark.  Wait, where's that?  Mord it up in there.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So there's two Vietnam anniversaries today. 
[00:57:30]  Nixon announced the U.S. was sending troops to Cambodia 43 years ago.  Yeah.  Saigon fell to communist forces 38 years ago.  Gotcha.  I apologize.  Do you remember that?  That's a child of the 80s.  Child of the 80s, baby.  Yeah, those helicopters leaving the top of the embassy, pushing them off of the fucking  carrier decks once they landed, just dumped them into the fucking ocean.  That was a dramatic video.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Cray cray.  Why no Hitler songs today for Anthony? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, what happened?  Well, I can play something into break if you'd like.  Yeah, try to figure something out.  All right.  A march?  Bring the whole Hitler anniversary together.  Some Wagner?  I personally would have went with Susu Studio myself.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's ready.  I was juggling between the two.  Were you really?  Yeah.  This is 28 years old, this song.  Susu Studio.  This is Susu Studio.  Yes.  Love that.  American Psycho. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  Do we have the Susu Studio speech?  Can you find the Susu Studio speech, please?  That's a good one.  Sam Roberts.  Have you seen the I Think It Was a Funny or Die with Huey Lewis and Weird Al?  No.  Doing the whole scene where he fucking kills Paul Allen in the room?  Mm-hmm.  It's that scene, but with Huey Lewis and Weird Al.  And it's fucking great.  Really?  Fucking hilarious.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Which one do you want to play first? 
[00:59:00]  How about The Funny or Die?  All right.  Let's do The Funny or Die.  Yeah.  Let's see this one.  Is it too much of a visual because we do radio?  No, it's, it's, the visual is good because Huey's doing all the movements that, uh, that  he did in American Psycho.  Full screen, please.  Got it.  Thank you.  Do you like American Psycho?  Mm-hmm.  It's okay. 
[00:59:30]  Although originally polarizing to audiences and critics alike, it developed a much-deserved  cult following when released on digital video disc or DVD.  There it found a second life and really came into its own commercially and artistically.  He's doing the whole fucking thing.  The movie works both as a grim examination of male vanity while also maintaining real  genre thrills.  Justifying these total shifts by placing the audience inside the head of the duplicitous  lead character.  Christian Bale's dynamite performance gives it a big boost. 
[01:00:00]  Yes.  Should we lose those games?  The role almost went to Leo.  But nobody could have brought that certain half.  He's putting the little backwards to it.  Quite like Bale.  A role he later recalled a shade of in Christopher Nolan's Batman pictures.  Hey.  Yes, Al?  Why are there newspapers all over the place?  Is that like a Huey Lewis on the News joke or something?  No, Al.  Is that a raincoat? 
[01:00:30]  Yes, it is.  He's doing a whole lot.  In 2005, Lionsgate released this.  The Uncut.  I think it's an undisputed masterpiece.  A movie so entertaining, most people probably don't listen to the best.  Most people probably don't listen to the lyrics.  But they should.  Because it's not just a great character study, but a sardonic metaphor for 1980s greed and  materialism.  Hey, Al.  Ah!  Oh, my God.  Try parodying one of my songs now, you stupid bastard. 
[01:01:00]  Hacking Weird Al's head off with a axe.  Right on, man.  Pretty good parody.  Oh, Jesus.  30-year anniversary for sports.  Wow.  Huey Lewis.  Damn!  Yeah.  Funny or die.  Bravo.  That was a huge album.  That was murder.  That wasn't funny.  Oh, shit.  Bravo on that.  It was a parody.  Who's the big...  Is E-Rock the big fan?  Oh, he loves Weird Al.  Weird Al. 
[01:01:30]  What did you think of the Funny or Die thing?  I thought it was great.  Oh.  Yeah, we learned that about E-Rock.  He's all in with Weird Al.  You like Weird Al.  Oh, he loves him.  Not just likes.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  Many times.  Many times.  Why would you see Weird Al live?  We did this already, but...  I'm sure Otto's going to call in any minute now.  I got to tell you, I would see Weird Al live.  Yeah?  Yeah, if he was sitting next to me in the studio.  Yeah.  I would see him live.  Oh.  Well, he comes out and does fat in the fat suit. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, you know, he's got a good stage show.  Oh, okay.  With his goofs on.  That's got to be tough to do.  That's the finale.  Oh, it is?  That's what E-Rock's doing.  That's the encore?  You know, Weird Al's been around probably 30 years himself.  Because I'm fat.  I'm fat.  Late 70s, yeah.  Late 70s, huh?  Really, really fat.  That's 35 years.  Yeah.  Hey, can we play the Susudio scene?  Oh, yeah.  Because this song's 28 years old today for American Psycho.  And this is the actual scene that they were parodying. 
[01:02:30]  I gather.  Such a good one.  Patrick Bateman.  This is Susudio.  A great, great song.  Personal favorite.  Personal favorite.  Oh, they can't show the full scene.  Oh, why?  Because it's like a sex scene.  Oh, man.  Oh, that was the sex scene?  Oh, I thought it was a scene with Paul Allen.  It was like flexing and... 
[01:03:00]  Which scene was the one with Paul Allen?  That was Hip To Be Square, right?  Yeah.  Oh, it's Hip To Be Square.  Damn.  That's funny.  Now she don't even know my name.  Yeah, they're just...  Now it's just Susudio.  Yeah, they're just doing clips from the fucking movie.  It's an awesome movie.  I've never seen this.  You've never seen American Psycho?  No.  You read the book, though.  I read the book twice.  And I know that there are certain things in the book that people told me weren't in the  movie, and I'm like, I'll just hate the movie. 
[01:03:30]  I just think his character's great.  Like the scene in the...  Is there a scene in the movie where he gets a hooker, and he takes a car battery, and he  fucking takes alligator clips, and hooks the car battery up to her nipples?  No.  That's in the book.  Oh, man.  Or how about in the fucking...  Is there a scene where he takes a fucking habitrail, and shoves it in a girl's cunt with  cheese in it, and puts a fucking rat in the other side?  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:00]  And Lexus goes into the habitrail, and then pulls the habitrail out, and watches it in  her stomach.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  I have not.  It's in the movie.  That's in the book.  No.  Yeah, but there's all that stuff.  Brett Easton Ellis, by the way, is fucking really funny on Twitter.  He's great.  But there's all that stuff in...  Like with the fucking...  Talk about Huey Lewis, and who else did he love?  Yeah, all those.  He also...  What the fuck?  Obsessing over the product. 
[01:04:30]  What's her name?  Who's that bitch that fucking drowned in the bathtub?  He was jacked in the fuck.  Anyone?  Cocaine?  Drowned in the bathtub?  Oh, Whitney Houston.  Oh, Whitney.  Oh, yeah.  Whitney Houston.  Yeah.  He liked her, too.  He's listening to Walking on Sunshine in the cab.  Yeah, that's true.  Is he?  Mm-hmm.  Are those two...  Did he kill these girls?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he does. 
[01:05:00]  That's one of those is the hooker.  But he's supposedly...  Oh!  I forget.  There's a funny scene.  Not funny, but...  Where he fucks...  I forget how he knocks the girl's teeth out.  He knocks all of her teeth out with a drill.  And then he fucks her mouth.  That's a funny scene?  No, the book is...  Oh, and when he steps on the dog, they probably didn't do this.  You should see the movie, though, because now I would be curious to hear what you think  about it.  Did he kill the dog of a homeless guy? 
[01:05:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  Where he steps on the dog's front paws?  Oh, the movie's...  I mean, you don't see it.  Why don't you get a job?  Yeah.  I love that.  The movie's pretty fucking brutal.  Yeah, I'm sure it is.  And very bloody.  And the scenes I'm talking about probably are rated at X.  Do you know how bad you smell?  He's talking to the homeless guy.  Did you get a job?  Ow.  Did you get a job?  Ow.  Is he racist in the movie?  No, they don't really go into that.  Not so much.  Why would they?  In the book, he certainly...  Well, he only was when he...  When he fucked.  Did he give the guy a piece of gum before stabbing him? 
[01:06:00]  I haven't seen the movie in a while.  I don't remember.  No, I don't think so.  Yeah.  I love this.  All right.  Ah!  He just screams when he drops the chainsaw on our fucking head.  Oh, Jesus.  What a great character.  He was great in that movie.  What is the...  Christian Bell.  What do you think...  Like, at the end, they said, this is not an exit.  Isn't this...  Isn't the...  Like, the cabbie, in the end, knows that he's looking for him.  Hey, you're the guy we're looking for.  We killed the cabbie.  Was this whole thing a dream or his fantasies? 
[01:06:30]  I know.  That's the big question there, isn't it?  Was it all a fucking mental fantasy?  A mental breakdown?  Just thinking about killing people?  Yeah.  We barely even know who anybody is at the end.  Yeah, exactly.  All the names have gotten so mixed up.  Yeah, the names are all mixed up and convoluted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's...  I liked it.  I love it.  It's fucking...  And he's just fucking great.  So fucking...  All right.  I'm trying to turn some videotapes.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm fucking writing a show about a CIA agent where I just solve all the crimes. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, yeah?  How's that coming out?  Fucking good.  Like Iraq's movie?  Got 300 episodes.  CIA.  Chipper in action.  Oh, CIA means chipper in action.  I'll try to help.  Yeesh.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  With that, we got a Tennessee couple suing after a photo of a son with Down syndrome used 
[01:07:30]  for a retarded news segment.  Hmm?  Mm-hmm.  What happened there?  Weird news.  Weird news.  Weird news.  It's not scores.  I heard he used weird news, the theme.  Weird news.  I got that news, too, that he got his jingle back.  He got the jingle back.  Oh, he got the jingle back.  He must have heard that we were very disappointed that he wasn't using it.  I hear there's a new PFG TV online.  We can't just keep doing it.  I know, but it's so great.  Maybe take a look just to see.  Here's the weird news.  Just up to weird news. 
[01:08:00]  There are some deranged stories that are very strange.  Yeah.  Weird news.  All right.  Here's the story of weird news.  It won't be weird.  It won't be news.  And it won't be true.  Tennessee couple sues after a photo of a son with Down syndrome used for a retarded  news segment.  So you got a Tennessee couple.  Yeah.  And they were sickened to find a picture of their son with Down syndrome used in a ridiculing  way online, and now they're suing for emotional distress and other damages.  Oh, boy.  Nashville parents, Pamela and Bernard, claim an altered image of their son, Adam, had 
[01:08:30]  been posted on various websites, including a Florida radio stations.  Yeah.  Along with defamatory descriptions and commentary, according to a lawsuit filed this month in  U.S. District Court in Tennessee.  Oh.  The picture was taken in 2004 at an art class in Nashville, according to the suit.  He was 17 at the time.  And an instructor had asked him to show off a drawing that said, Go Titans won.  Go Titans won?  Mm-hmm.  What does that mean? 
[01:09:00]  One as in O-N-E, by the way.  Go Titans.  What does that even mean?  I don't know.  Is that like number one?  Well, Tennessee, they're obviously a Titans fan.  Yeah.  And maybe one is the, Go Titans won, is maybe one was the number of the player he liked?  Who knows?  Maybe Go Titans are number one.  Maybe it's number one, but it's not said that way in this article.  Weird news.  That picture of Adam holding up a sketch ended up online via the Arts Center's website, Crane  said, but was lifted by others without permission.  Uh-oh. 
[01:09:30]  So the picture's online.  Other people decided to take it and do some things with it.  People do that.  Last to lie, a member of a watchdog group looking to end the use of the word retard put a spotlight  on Florida station, WHPT-FM, which posted the picture on its webpage for The Cowhead Show.  Oh, no.  I see that.  Oh, you don't want that.  Parents sue Cowhead Radio Show.  The Cowhead Show.  But these watchdog groups that want the word retarded ended, like, and then they start suing 
[01:10:00]  people for using the word.  Yeah.  Come on.  So, can we go to the news story from here?  Sure.  Please.  All right, here we go.  We know cowheads.  Let me go back to the beginning, because they showed Cowhead's face.  Oh, please.  Oh, boy.  Go right to the beginning here.  We sort of know Cowhead.  E-Rock really knows Cowhead.  Oh, boy.  He's a good guy.  He is.  He's a great guy.  Well, apparently not.  I know about him.  He is a good guy.  Lawsuit filed over shock jock segment.  Oh, no.  Shock jock.  Let me tell you something, though, Opie.  Yes.  Now, you know, E-Rock knows Cowhead.  We know Cowhead to some extent and stuff. 
[01:10:30]  But I got to tell you, it feels pretty goddamn good sitting on this side of the story.  I swear to God, when I see that graphic shock jock segment, lawsuit, picture, the fucking  news guy who's a little serious now, I am so glad this isn't us.  But do they tie us into it?  I hope not.  They do tie us into a lot of these shock jock segments.  Maybe not this one.  Maybe, because originally they thought the photo was of our own Eric Nagle.  Oh, that's true.  I didn't mean that, E-Rock. 
[01:11:00]  Wow, but you did.  I don't think we did.  That would be the cow body show.  The dunderhead.  The empty head show.  I'm sorry, Eric.  I love you, E-Rock.  You show it in weird ways, though.  I know.  I feel affectionate towards that sweetie.  Here we go.  You knew tonight a multi-million dollar lawsuit triggered by a local shock jocks segment doesn't  have a lot of people laughing tonight.  It has drawn plenty of criticism and a fight that comes all the way from Tennessee. 
[01:11:30]  Allison Morrow joins us live outside the St. Petersburg radio station to explain tonight.  Allison.  Jameson, these advocacy groups are calling this disturbing, and the family suing the cow head  show calls it humiliating.  This is Adam Holland in art class displaying his work.  Here is the same picture altered for Tampa Bay's cow head radio show using a word Lise  Fox fights daily.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, they don't even show 
[01:12:00]  it or say it.  These fucking cocks in the news.  They blur, they entirely blurred out the fucking sign that cow head had, I guess, put up.  If it said retard news or retarded news, that's the story.  Show the fucking sign.  Wow.  Could this cut?  Oh, good God.  Are we fucking jizz bags?  What do the signs say, Iraq?  Do you know?  Did it just say retarded news?  Yeah, it just says retarded news.  How long has it been up there?  Or retarded news?  I don't think that long.  I think maybe a couple days at most. 
[01:12:30]  It just went up?  By the way, I don't want to wait until the end of the story.  Cow head is so fired.  Are we going to have to find him a job?  Fired, fired, totally fired.  He's so fired.  He's not allowed to comment, of course, but.  $18 million.  They're going to make a deal and say, look, we're doing the right thing here.  We're going to let our guy go.  Because the $18 million is going to be on the fucking radio station.  Well, the $18 million is divided between the three people they're suing.  They're not suing cow head.  They're suing the station.  Yeah.  And then a little further in the article, there's somebody upstate New York that they're suing to.  Why?  For they using it, too? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, for using the photo.  What is the photo?  Can we see it?  We saw the photo right here, right?  Retarded news.  Oh, that's the one cow head used.  And they fucking took the picture.  They didn't show that on the news.  The news is really a fucking disgrace.  How is it?  How can you tell the story without showing the fucking?  Using a word that's the word is retarded.  Yeah.  Just say it.  Just say it.  Oh, my God.  God, the news is...  It's amazing how already the news annoys me with this.  All right, so what else is... 
[01:13:30]  I'm sorry.  Is that the mother?  Is that the watchdog group?  Jesus.  Sure.  Oh, fuck.  Police Fox fights daily.  I worked very hard to stop people from using the R word.  Fox directs the Florida Center for Inclusive Communities, which aims to make life easier for people with disabilities.  She says this photo makes life harder.  And so does the lawsuit now facing Cox Media.  Oh, boy.  Cox.  It centers on the photo of Holland, who has Down syndrome.  His parents accuse cow heads show of causing severe mental anguish by using their son's photo next to a word that makes fun of people with intellectual disabilities. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, my fucking...  Can you listen to the...  What is this, a game show?  We've got to figure it out.  Listen to the language.  Yes.  The news uses this fucking sickening...  Right.  Can you believe it?  Tell the story.  ...antiseptic language.  They're not going to...  They're not...  If you use the word in the news story, you're not using it in a derogatory fashion.  You're telling the story.  They're leaving out the biggest part of the story.  They're simply... 
[01:14:30]  They are a fucking...  Terrible.  ...race the news.  This is ridiculous.  They make fun of people with intellectual...  You know, Carlin's genius was he said how it removes all the humanity.  Yes.  Hey, there's a picture of a kid with Down syndrome, and they put the word retarded news, and the parents are very upset.  There's the story.  Yeah.  There's the story.  Retarded news.  Wow.  Man.  He knew tonight a multi-million dollar loss.  His parents accused Cowhead's show of causing severe mental anguish by using their son's photo next to a word that makes fun of people with intellectual disabilities. 
[01:15:00]  The use of this word perpetuates stereotypes.  It's painful.  But we don't know the word.  He's a typical radio shock jock competing with other radio shock jocks.  Defense attorney Joe Episcopo says the case may be difficult to win.  Joe Episcopo.  The show says it stopped using the photo and may be protected by the First Amendment,  even though Holland's parents want $6 million. 
[01:15:30]  To us ordinary citizens, defamation, what does that mean?  It means nothing.  We have no loss.  And you've got to have a financial loss to bring a lawsuit.  In this case, though, Fox says the greatest loss may not be financial.  Rather, how the picture sets back work like theirs.  Work reflected by the original picture, where Adams smiling in art class, proud and unashamed.  To be independent, to be productive, to be valued, and to be included.  Just saying. 
[01:16:00]  Now, the Cox Media Group did send out a statement a few hours ago saying Cox companies are committed to empowering individuals and families,  as well as promoting diversity and inclusion.  Oh, all the keywords.  Some fucking faggoty lawyer.  Joe Episcopo tells us likely the only way these parents will get the $6 million that they are after  is if they can prove that the Cowhead Show somehow made a profit by using their son's photo.  We're live in St. Petersburg tonight.  I'm Allison Morrow, ABC.  You know, Cowhead is so fired. 
[01:16:30]  So fired.  We're staying like that.  You know what, though?  I think a couple things you're going to depend on.  Who altered the photo?  Because if, in good faith, you're using a photo that's online and you just think that's the photo.  Jim, Jim, Jim.  Oh, boy.  You think that's a boss's man.  How logic?  Look how naive he is.  He's still the cutest boy, isn't he?  Oh, my God.  I have no doubt in my mind.  Jim, Jim.  He's fired.  Fired.  So totally fired.  They just want it off their plate. 
[01:17:00]  They don't want to deal with this shit.  Who used the picture?  Where it came from?  Goodbye.  Problem over.  Goodbye.  That statement says everything you need to know.  Diversity, inclusion.  I don't think he should be fired, but the fact is he's going to be fired by the end of the week.  That fucking photo is now attached to him.  Right.  He's attached to Cox Media.  And they're going to make a big donation to the local retarded group. 
[01:17:30]  It's called retarded group.  Whatever it is.  This in our case would be management.  I want to apologize for that.  Cox will make a huge donation locally.  Yeah.  We got rid of the guy.  Let's all move on.  You know, if the parent...  There's no tolerance for shock jocks anymore.  If the parents are really...  He's not a shock jock.  He's more than a fucking shock jock, by the way.  Parents are upset.  So why not just...  Why does everything have to be litigated?  Like, I understand why the parents would be pissed off.  Like, that's your kid.  So why don't they just call... 
[01:18:00]  And this is one of those weird times where if you do something like that and the parents  are like, that's fucking horrendous.  If you say you're sorry, you probably mean it.  If you talk to Cowhead, he probably would feel bad about that.  Like, I don't think anybody wants to take a real retarded kid and make his parents feel  bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he's that type of guy.  But the problem is Cox is not going to allow him to talk.  No.  Because Cowhead would probably go, look, I'm absolutely sorry.  And I would believe him, too.  Oh, he's apologizing, which means he's admitting guilt. 
[01:18:30]  Right, right.  The lawyers don't want you to do that.  Let the lawyers handle it.  Yeah, yeah.  Let the lawyers handle it.  That's always best for you.  By the way, you're fired.  Yeah.  So totally fired.  Then again, it also depends on the contract who runs his website.  Who the fuck does the website?  They don't give a fuck about any of that.  Yeah.  They'll pay him out if they have to.  They don't give a fuck.  He's fired.  Maybe they give him money in the end.  That's true.  Because they don't have grounds to fire him.  Damn. 
[01:19:00]  That picture's been around since 2004, that guy's name?  Yeah, people have been kind of using it here and there.  Yeah.  E-Rock, what do you know?  I know he's not talking, but what do you know?  That's all I know right now.  Is he panicking?  No, he doesn't seem to be panicking, but nobody on the show is allowed to.  To say anything publicly right now.  Does he know he's fired?  I don't even know if he's on today.  I've got to find that out.  No way is he on today.  Does he know he's going to be fired?  Is he positive of it?  I've known the guy for many years, and his answers are very thought out. 
[01:19:30]  Like the lawyer says, if anyone asks you, you paste this into your message, and that's what you said.  Tell him if he had any plans of saying or doing anything, but was afraid that doing that would get him fired, to do it.  Because it doesn't matter.  He's fired anyway.  Okay.  You don't have those regrets.  Saying it may cost him money.  Well, maybe.  Because that may violate the contract, you know.  But, you know, it's one of those things, if you have regrets and go, well, I didn't do that because I didn't want to get fired, but then they fired me anyway. 
[01:20:00]  Nah, just don't.  Yeah.  Because you're a fucking poor cowhead.  I think his website for his radio show is privately run, but it also has an interface with the Cox radio station.  Yeah, none of that matters, though.  They just want it to go away immediately.  Yeah, none of that matters.  They don't want to deal with diversity problems ever.  All they see is the picture, cowhead, the company.  Sponsors.  How do you separate the picture, cowhead, from the company?  You remove the cowhead bridge between the picture and the company. 
[01:20:30]  I mean, if that means paying them out.  Yeah.  They don't care.  Well, they're looking at a possible $6 million precedent-setting lawsuit.  $18 million lawsuit.  You could build a man with that.  There's not a radio company around that's going to support a DJ being sued for $18 million.  or part of an $18 million lawsuit.  There's no fucking way.  Correctamundo.  Not a chance.  Is this a national story, Sam?  Yeah.  It's going national, too? 
[01:21:00]  Some of the British papers.  Oh, he's so fired.  He might not even make it out of today.  Daily Mail.  On the cowhead radio show.  They may.  They use the R word.  The R word.  I know.  He is on today.  All right.  Good for him.  How do you know he's on today?  He's on right now?  No.  Well, he does afternoons.  Oh, how do you know he's on?  Because he just told me he's doing a show today.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  We were told that.  We've been told that.  Yeah, yeah.  He'll go in.  Here's what's going to happen.  He will go in.  They will be like, um, Kyle, can we see you a minute? 
[01:21:30]  We're just thinking, with all the news and stuff, it's probably best we keep you off the air today.  Right.  Today.  Today.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, we're going to have to do a suspension.  We've been told that three times, I think.  I think.  Dude, he will not be on the air today.  Let me tell you this again.  He will not be on the air today.  Uh.  And they probably have good intentions, but they're feeling the heat in the back offices.  Dude, the heat.  And they're like, oh my God.  No, we got to sit him out today.  It's in the Daily News. 
[01:22:00]  The New York Daily News.  Dude, he's not on today.  MSNBC has it.  It's a, it made AP?  He's not on the air today.  He thinks he's going, oh, come on, cowhead.  Don't be this stupid.  We're not.  He's just trying to, you know, even if they told him.  I know, but we've seen this so many times.  We're really, we really are experts at this shit.  We are, we should be fucking called in whenever this happens to talk to the jock.  Right.  And let him know exactly what's going to happen. 
[01:22:30]  Step by step.  Consultants.  Yes.  We are firing consultants.  Yes.  If you show up, you know you're done.  Right.  Huffington Post.  Right.  ABC National.  Right.  Not local.  No, they're not.  He's done.  Like ABC.news.  We're like the priest and the fucking army guy that used to show up at the door.  Hi.  I'm sorry about your son.  Yeah.  We are the bearers of bad news.  The worst thing that could happen to a high profile radio show is to get national coverage. 
[01:23:00]  National coverage.  There was a time you got the national coverage and it was great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You skated, you know, but not anymore.  Well, you're never going to hear shock jock makes good point.  They don't want to even hear you.  You're never going to.  Makes good point.  Because they label you as a shock jock so they feel like you're just a fucking animal  and that you would not have a heart or a soul or a good point.  Right.  Well, you're never going to say anything that's so funny and so poignant that they're like,  shock jock surprises everyone.  They lower what kind of a person you are by saying shock jock to begin with so they don't 
[01:23:30]  want to hear from you.  This is one of those things where, look, it was in poor taste.  As a comic, I've said a million things in poor taste.  We do it every day.  We say things in poor taste.  Of course.  It's a part of this genre of entertainment.  And it's one of those things where you just wish the parents would call and go, hey, asshole.  Yeah.  And then, you know what?  You go, and in a genuine exchange, you go, you know what?  That was kind of fucked up.  We apologize.  And we mean it.  I understand the parents making this an issue.  Yeah, I understand they're making it an issue, but not a $60 lawsuit. 
[01:24:00]  $18 million they want.  Oh, they're angry.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're just angry.  That's just by preventing the father from driving up to what the fuck is.  It's your son.  Right.  Your son.  It's funny.  Like, as much as I truly, sorry, Jimmy.  But the second point of what I'm making here is I truly believe Cowhead didn't mean to  fucking purposely hurt this family.  But that doesn't matter, right, Anthony?  Doesn't matter at all.  What happens today?  Look, we're going to sit you out today, you know, let this die down a little bit as they're 
[01:24:30]  just sweating in the back offices.  Like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, let's look at his contract.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, the lawyers are already pawing over his contract.  Right.  Because now they're hoping they could fire him without paying.  Without paying.  Because that's what kind of guys they are.  So it's like, should we call him up or something?  No, no, no.  Wait until he comes in.  We'll call him into the office and we'll suspend him.  We'll suspend him for how long? 
[01:25:00]  Indefinite.  My favorite one of all time, and we've been through a bunch of them, was the John Sykes  we're going to work this out slash oh my God, I got to leave this meeting immediately  because I just got a phone call that we're firing up.  Oh God, yes.  Remember that one?  Oh, I forgot about that one.  That asshole John Sykes.  Fuck him.  He didn't even understand wow when wow was incredibly hot in New York.  His first meeting with us was like, you know, this is wealthy, we're going to have to talk  about this.  He didn't get it.  He didn't want it. 
[01:25:30]  He came in as the new guy at CBS Radio.  And was that the Sex for Sam?  I guess it was, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sex for Sam.  There was a point they were trying, we were still naive, even though we'd been through  a major firing before this.  And they set up a meeting with Ken Stevens, me, and John Sykes comes in.  And he's like, he's really fucking pissed.  He goes like, not only do we have to deal with this situation, we've got to deal with  that wow thing.  And we're just biting our lips. 
[01:26:00]  We're not saying shit.  And then all of a sudden he gets a phone call as he's kind of like strategizing with us a  little bit here and there.  And all of a sudden you hear, oh, okay, all right, oh, all right, okay.  He hangs up the phone and goes, I got to go.  He doesn't even say bye.  He goes, I got to go right now.  And we're basically, why?  And he's like, I just got to go.  Got to go.  We never heard from the guy again.  That call was, yeah, they're being fired.  Yeah, basically it came down from upstairs.  Don't say another word to them.  Yeah, because it might affect, you know, a lawsuit we're thinking about filing against 
[01:26:30]  these fucking scumbags.  Oh, poor cow.  And he left the meeting immediately, never to be heard from again.  It's funny, man.  Like, I don't even, I've gotten tweets with pictures of retarded people in them.  And I never thought of a lawsuit, but I never really, I never retweet them because I just,  it's like, eh.  No.  And I'm not, I'm not shitting on, believe me, I certainly get how you do that.  You just, you just, you see something in a moment, it's an internet picture. 
[01:27:00]  But I never really fuck with a photo of a real retarded guy, but it's not out of fear  of getting in trouble.  It was just like, eh.  Minus.  You know what I mean?  It was one of those things where it's like, it's like, like talking about rape is one  thing, but like showing a photo of a victim, a rape victim and then mock it on.  I was like, ah, it just feels too real, but that's just a dumb decision.  He's not doing that because he's trying to humiliate the kid.  It was just a decision he probably would look back on and go, all right, we shouldn't have  done that.  This family just wants to be heard.  So to them, we're following an $18 million lawsuit, but in the end, they just want to 
[01:27:30]  feel like they were heard.  And that's where Cox steps in and says, we hear you.  Yep.  We're not giving you $6 million, but we will give a big donation to whatever charity you  want.  Yep.  Maybe the school or the home your kid is in at, is at at this time.  I don't know.  Whatever the fuck.  And we're going to fire the DJ.  Yeah.  And then the family goes, thank you for listening to me and allowing me to be heard.  And then it goes away.  Iraq comment. 
[01:28:00]  A question.  When these situations come up and especially since it happened to you, why does it the  news and everyone else knows you're fired, says you're fired, but the official statement  from the company is suspended indefinitely?  Why do they never say just the agreement's been terminated?  These people have been like, oh, yeah.  It has something to do with the contract, I guess.  Contract.  They have to paw over the contract first.  Find out what they're going to do.  They know that these fired, but they can't say it, so suspended.  And then they also want to give you hope that you're not fired so that they can get information 
[01:28:30]  as to who else was involved so they can fire them, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, because we had a famous meeting in, where was that one?  Framingham in some fucking hotel.  Where the fuck were we?  Like in a conference room in a hotel right off Route 9 in Framingham.  And Susan McDonald, who I worked with way back in the day in Rochester at CMF when I  was a fucking just nobody getting started.  She looked at me and Ant and said, okay, let's get this over with so we can get you back in 
[01:29:00]  the air.  Yeah, I remember saying that.  And all it was was questions to try to throw other people under the bus.  Who else was involved?  Yeah.  Which we did not do, by the way.  Yeah, we'll get this all out of the way.  And the way she said it, get you guys back on the air.  Yeah, because we were already in the suspended stage, but we were still under their umbrella.  So they're like, why would we fire them before we find out more fucking information?  We were being interrogated like terrorists.  Oh, I hope they're going to get us back on the air. 
[01:29:30]  And that's what we thought at the time.  Oh, I totally thought.  But they wanted to know what Dave Douglas had to do with the mayor's prank and Bruce Mittman.  And, you know, they could think what they want about us.  But the fact is, we didn't throw anyone under the bus.  Because they had nothing to do with any of that shit.  Take your pinch like a man.  We did take that pinch.  Keep your mouth shut.  I mean, I truly believe he's fired.  But if the slight fucking possibility is not.  And I say that knowing that I don't think there is a possibility.  Yeah.  Then it's going to be the sensitivity training and all that horse shit. 
[01:30:00]  They're going to go down that fake road.  That fake road.  The cow has got to make believe that he's learned a lot.  And it's just to draw such a huge lawsuit against the company and national story, national story with such a negative politically correct fucking incendiary device.  And all Cox Media is thinking is, oh, my God, the world thinks we hate retards. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  That's all they're thinking.  Yes.  So they're thinking, how the fuck do we make this all go away immediately?  The hard part, too, for Cowhead is that there's a photo of a real retarded guy.  That's where it makes it difficult, because if it was just a photo of his friend and the word retarded was being used, that's in poor taste.  That's a free speech issue.  And maybe this might be, too.  But when you take a picture of a real retarded guy, then the parents are like, OK, that's really.  You know what?  You know what it is?  It's that scene from Casino makes it harder. 
[01:31:00]  Is that what they say?  Why?  Why take the chance?  Why take the chance?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And after everybody says what a good guy he was and he's a stand-up guy, he's a Marine, eh, well, I take the chance.  Just whack him out.  Or in The Wire, when Marlo is fucking, when they're all sitting in jail talking about whether Michael was talking and he was not a young one, I don't think he's going to buck.  And Marlo just goes, you want to bet your future on that?  Yeah.  And you know he's a dead man. 
[01:31:30]  That's it.  Yeah, that's it.  One moment of doubt and you're fucking finished.  All right.  That's how it works.  We got three votes here.  What does everyone think?  Cowhead fired or skates?  I am voting with beyond a shadow of a doubt fired.  Yeah, I'm going to go with so fired.  Yeah, I mean, I think that's what it makes me say, because I love Cowhead.  He's a nice guy.  It's a funny show, too, and he's good at what he does.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah.  You know.  But in the climate, I think that that's what's going to happen, unfortunately. 
[01:32:00]  He'd be the first to skate in a really long time.  Oh, yeah.  I couldn't even tell you the last person that skated.  Oh, wait.  That dude, Mojo.  Oh, we did this guy.  He had some shit go down.  E-Rock, help me out.  MJ Kelly?  No.  No.  This was recent, a few months ago.  And we all said he was fired, and they kind of stuck with the guy.  Well, in Australia.  He was an up-and-coming shock jock in, I want to say Columbus. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, right, right.  The Tartigirl on the radio.  We called in?  Yes.  Yes.  I think he skated.  I think he was the last one.  But he had to go through the whole sensitivity thing, and he had to release a statement that  he learned a lot, and he emailed the family.  Well, he had plausible deniability, because it's a phone call.  You never know who you're really talking to.  He was able to convince people he had no idea that the person on the other end of the phone 
[01:33:00]  was slow.  Yeah.  Slow in a bad way.  Slow, right, right.  If you call into a radio show and you're slow, but it's because you're on drugs or something,  that's okay.  Right.  But if it's because you have a brain injury or was born retarded.  A little retarded.  They don't like that retarded.  Every group has one word they just want out of our vocabulary.  It empowers a group to make everybody not say a certain word. 
[01:33:30]  It is.  It obviously started with the black community.  Look, you're there.  We can't say that word.  Oh, if it's a derogatory term.  Look, you're a complete asshole if you look at a kid that's mentally challenged.  You go, hey, look at the retarded kid.  Who does that?  You're a complete asshole, obviously.  You're a psychopath.  But you can't take words away from people.  I nigh. 
[01:34:00]  The hashtag on the pad data moves the phone number.  What's wrong with that?  Can you see the phone number on the phone?  Not really.  What?  Wait, that whole hashtag.  Of course.  Yeah, the hashtag has to take precedence.  Wait, wait.  So you can't see the phone number?  Well, it says hashtag Opie Anthony on the top line, but also on the top line, I have to  try to squeeze in the phone number because we're doing a subject that might involve calls.  And on the bottom line has the topic that we're talking about. 
[01:34:30]  Wait, so what do you mean not really as far as not being able to see the phone number?  Well, the top line has to rotate so you can see everything that we put up there.  So it like scrolls?  Yeah, it'll sit there for a couple seconds.  Shut up.  Would you shut up? 
[01:35:00]  What a prick.  I hope you choke on that banana.  I know you and me both.  Oh, boy, is that funny.  I was only kidding.  Oh, God.  Well, get with the...  We should have well-timed shut up.  Get with the hashtag people because they're very excited that we have a hashtag for the  show.  Us, not so much.  Tell us it was a throwaway.  Like, yeah, cool.  Maybe this will help us a little bit.  Who cares?  But get with the hashtag team and see what they can figure out.  Come on in for the big win.  Hey, we got a shock jock production piece here, Sam Roberts. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  This is a perfect time to play it, I'm thinking.  Sure is.  Denny, Dennis Falcone.  Timmy doesn't like him.  I do like him very much.  No, but you don't like him as far as our show goes.  I do.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  What do you like about him?  I think he's...  I have a banana in my mouth.  I think he's entertaining and enjoyable.  Yeah.  Occasionally.  Yeah.  You know.  Sure.  Every time something comes up.  Well, what I would do is...  What would you? 
[01:36:00]  I like Dennis.  He's great.  His shelf life is less than two weeks.  Give him a break.  Well, here's what we do on this show.  Yeah.  We find a delicacy.  Like caviar.  Right.  And most people have caviar once in a while.  A little bit, right?  What we do is we're like, breakfast, caviar again.  But I do like Dennis, and I do think he's entertaining.  So we should rest him a little.  Not as much.  Yeah, I would...  Spread it out a little bit.  Yeah, spread it out a little bit.  Spread out your caviar a little bit, right? 
[01:36:30]  This way he doesn't run thin, and this way he's got a legitimate shelf life.  We do get overexcited when we find something new that we feel like is working.  We get really excited.  I know.  Shove it down everyone's throats for a week, and then we hate the person.  It's unbelievable.  Something that happens which just turns our spot, Tim.  Terrible.  Right.  Just awful.  So, shock jack.  Yeah, Dennis Falcone wanted to give everybody a history of the shock jock, so...  Oh, nice.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Hey, everybody.  It's your old pal, DJ Dennis Falcone.  And you know, before we can appreciate what those wild guys, Opie and Anthony do...  I know why he doesn't have a full-time job, by the way, in radio.  Why?  He has a shitty fucking voice.  It's not strong, is it?  No, it's not.  Oh.  He needs a lot of processing behind him.  Like Sam Roberts.  He was up for a pretty good gig.  Yeah, but you got the personality.  Shitty voice.  If you don't have the voice, you gotta have the personality.  Right. 
[01:37:30]  Dennis has neither.  I imagine they liked what Sam was saying, but didn't like his voice.  Like, how shallow?  That's what happened.  I know.  It's a shallow fucking idea for a station.  That was Entertainment Weekly, right?  It's Entertainment Weekly.  It's just them fucking doing shallow stories about shallow people.  But Sam would be good at that.  Yeah.  Because Sam's a fucking weird...  He knows pop culture.  He's a weirdo.  He's perfect for that stupid fucking channel.  But he's just a fucking weirdo with no emotions tied into anything. 
[01:38:00]  He's perfect for that show.  I think that's...  He's a creep.  What?  He's a creep.  But it's disgusting that they didn't want him because of his voice.  Yeah.  His lack of talent is what should sink him.  But that's...  What a shallow way to look.  Your voice is normal.  He was perfect for what they're trying to do with that shit.  That's what happened.  He would have made it entertaining, to be honest with you.  Magazine people programming radio stations make decisions, you know?  They really told you that, huh?  Mm-hmm.  That's horrendous.  And you still need a fucking break, and they do that to you. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  Why didn't the company step in and go, fuck you?  He's the right man...  You know, he's the best man for the job.  Yeah.  They probably allow you to program it.  Who gives a fuck about what the voice sounds like these days?  Well, we've got to make sure it's on brand, you know?  As long as you have the personality.  Right.  Dennis.  Which has neither...  He has neither, you're saying?  Neither.  That's too bad.  That's really a crying shame for him, because he wants it.  By the way, can you think of a better scenario than Entertainment Weekly?  Saying, listen, who's this guy Chipperson?  We like how he sounds. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God.  He's got a good sense of humor.  He keeps it clean.  Humor.  It looks like Hugh Jackman's going to be playing the Wolverine again.  Oh, boy.  That's smart.  I don't think it'd work.  I don't think...  Why don't we try it on our show?  Yeah, like, whatever...  We'll burn it out by Thursday.  What's an entertainment story that they'll be covering?  Well, we can work on it during the break.  Yeah, let's do that, and then we'll have...  We'll get some quick entertainment music behind Chip, and we'll see how it works.  Yeah, word. 
[01:39:30]  All right, we'll get all the big pop culture stories for today for you.  Yep, get ready for some home runs, cocksuckers.  Yeah.  Let's do that during the break, but first, the shock jock piece.  Hey, everybody.  It's your old pal, DJ Dennis Falcone.  And, you know, before we can appreciate what those wild guys, Opie and Anthony, do,  we've got to give a tip of the hat to those who have paved the way.  So, today, let's take a journey through the history of American Shock Chocolates. 
[01:40:00]  Now, let's set the Wayback Machine to 1968 for a DJ by the name of Snowy Hills.  He had a young starlet named Lorraine Baines in the studio.  Let's give a listen.  good morning snowy hills here on wxcf 97.3 with lorraine baines in studio lorraine  already got her hoo-haws out don't you dearie oh you know it what do you say we go ahead and  stick this can of hairspray right up the old caboose-a-roo go ahead and fill her up and a  nice caboose it is tight fit huh lorraine nothing i haven't taken before where would you look at

[01:41:00]  degree burns all over his face and body but that didn't stop him from playing the hits until  1989 when he was found to be in possession of child pornography  hey the more you know am i right just teasing keep those ears to the speakers for the next time  your radio pal dj dennis falcone that's me takes you through the history of american shock jockery  this this is the opn entry show opn entry the date is october 11th 1983 it's 7 18 p.m detective club soda

[01:44:00]  technical but no no it's i don't know i don't know if it matters in the end but in radio like  you know we're gonna do chip doing the entertainment news yeah looking at pop culture just to kind of  put entertainment weekly to shame a new channel here it's like sam that pretty much no one will  fucking listen to on a regular basis when they probably spend a shitload of money on that  uh how many shows do they have over there at entertainment weekly they're gonna have a whole 
[01:44:30]  line they're gonna have a full-time morning show full-time afternoon show uh several one-hour shows  that uh you know are on throughout the week and then uh weekend lineup too who do they sign  uh i know they couldn't give you one slot over there i did that for the afternoon show it's  that voice opie it's the voice not a great voice to it sam knows pop culture though oh but the voice  is dreadful yeah i just can't communicate yeah no no people hear it and they're like ah it's like 
[01:45:00]  audio hepatitis so who got the gig over you uh i don't know if they've officially uh hired somebody  for the afternoon show last i heard they were actually looking at two girls uh chicks maybe that's  the target demo i don't know yeah you could easily fit in that why don't you have a two girls in  you two girls one cup yeah just a cup two girls one sap there's a fucking song could be uh one hump  yeah two girls one hump or they could call the show two gals and a sam oh two gals and a sam here we 
[01:45:30]  are you think that's a good theme song oh that's not catchy and then we've got to hire a name that  has never done radio before who's the name well the morning roberts yeah the morning show that was  just self-deprecating my life the morning show is uh one of the editors for the magazine  oh and a girl who used to be on survivor which one jerry from the facts the lies jerry oh i know 
[01:46:00]  jerry pop up jerry you know her last name is mandarin uh season two maybe season three  jerry you remember jerry she was in uh maybe any w this broad pop her up season two right um  yeah maybe i don't remember or tree you remember jerry what the fuck has she done a radio that 
[01:46:30]  she's got a show i remember her remember kimmy who used to come on and let me see her naked man  remember kimmy that's 13 years ago dude shit dude that's 13 years ago crazy wow she's probably 40  now she was like was she 25 26 then oh no she was probably uh yeah 22 she was probably mid 30s  but maybe shit jerry yeah what season was she on for the people out there i don't know i guess  it doesn't matter she's gonna be dishing the dirt about tinseltown oh well everything you want 
[01:47:00]  to know about the kardashians and the lohans right that's right jerry  the survivor of the australian outback yes all right australia by nigh but but you've been waiting  for a full-time show for eight years and they just pull some survivor broad they got a voice never done  radio in my i i i don't think she's ever done radio you gotta have a little patience they're doing more 
[01:47:30]  than waiting holy fuck what the fuck do you have to do around here i don't know well it's easy to beat  the shit out of sam but i mean look we gotta take a serious angle on this what the fuck is  what else do you want from the fucking kid you have a whole you have a whole channel that you  you gotta fill up a whole lineup it's unless contractually they allow them just to make  their own lineup with no interference and then they grab some fucking reality i wouldn't even call  her a star at this point no that's the morning show uh-huh oh my god it's great keep giving shows 
[01:48:00]  the people who don't do radio yeah as a guy sits here for eight years you know working on his craft  this gary bucey interview with you uh yesterday jimmy was great it was really strong  really strong we were saying both of us well yeah i could so i could say thank you and so can you  thank you all right you guys can say thank you separately we should say we should do a show called  frickin frack i don't know what the hell sam's mean go ahead jam that's for you we're gonna go back to  abusing you now sam but uh there was a real moment there you should have got the fucking gig 
[01:48:30]  now cherish that well yeah what that moment you cherish that because you can't buy groceries with  it no and it was told to you the voice is a little fucking weird for them huh yeah they couldn't get  well everybody in radio in the radio side of things they all loved the demo they said it was  they said it was better than anybody else's so he said that to you 100 which makes it even worse  they said that his demo was the best one this is the best one and what the entertainment weekly  guy wasn't feeling your voice correct oh we're gonna fucking kill him correct i don't know 
[01:49:00]  specifically who it was i i will openly say this his life's gonna be miserable around us but it was  it was somebody at the magazine and it's a shit magazine anyway at the magazine not here well that  guy'd be walking around that's i don't know who the guy was we'll find out you find out everything  i will but that's what that's what it is they're allowing the magazine that's probably part of the  deal we can use you use our name but we get to put whoever we want okay fair enough and then in the  end and you got to blame greenstein he should have said well tough shit this guy had the best 
[01:49:30]  demo we're gonna try to find him a spot on this new channel what the company i think does wrong is  they say okay the important thing is getting the banner of entertainment weekly on here yeah but  it's like guys this is a content driven platform you're allowing these dummies in the magazine to  program their own like what are you doing like they could you're letting them put whoever they want  there like that's like saying hey as long as we have that banner we don't care how awful the content 
[01:50:00]  is yeah shouldn't the company have the say on who goes on the air how the fuck you're gonna keep  subs like that it doesn't make sense that's a really dumb way to do it and they also gave us  they gave them our studio of course they did that was promised us officially by scott greenstein when i  asked him he goes yeah we give you a piece we'll get we'll cut it to here he said that to me we were  right who else was with me i know there were other people around he goes yeah no problem we'll  cut we're gonna just give you about uh i i don't know it would have been about eight more feet i  would say he goes we'll cut it right here no problem yeah and then uh boom and they figured 
[01:50:30]  that was gonna cost 8.7 million dollars so half million well the agent didn't do anything about it  in the contracts and even without that they could still do something in this studio to make things  better like you know and make it more like a fucking the place to be it isn't as great i hate  to say it like that it's such a douchey way to say it but hey it's true though don cheedle's agent  or disney sees this show on par with rotten tomatoes as far as importance in radio and that is where the 
[01:51:00]  company needs to do more because we can't change that on the air oh i'm getting pictures of the pad  data so i guess it's hashtag op anthony and then it says 866 after it oh god what happens with the  866 does that scroll through there you see that for like two seconds and then all of a sudden it  starts rotating so it scrolls and you see the phone yeah but you know what some radios don't scroll  and so that's all they're gonna get sometimes they scroll for a moment and then they just go back 
[01:51:30]  to the xnay on the hashtag gay they thought that was a big fucking deal a big fucking move on their  part so let's remember that as far as things that they've done for us that's right you know it's like  well let's think of what they've done for well they did give us the hashtag and hashtag you know  some asshole out there and i mean that in a loving way oh when we talked about the hashtag they  actually went through and they discovered even with us discuss discussing the new hashtag yeah 
[01:52:00]  that five people used it that day all right five and they got very mad that we talked about the  hashtag so we should move on they didn't like it oh no why  it's a big thing hashtag  couldn't anybody just make one up 
[01:52:30]  i might stick my dick in that gabby douglas's face wow man she's 14  what how old is she i don't know  i don't know how old she's 17. someone said that we got to play the audio from yesterday like it got a  little weird with her it's kind of cute for a black chick what seems more controversial  when you're talking about the hashtag i know it's like it's like listen this is like listening to  fucking the sheriff in mississippi bernie they're so cute when they're young she's fucking hot man 
[01:53:00]  i mean i just think she's too young but something's going on with this guy over here what happened  he stops drinking and now he's openly admitting that he would actually have sex with a black girl  you you all right this is a progress that people don't understand are you all right this i think  this is officially the first time you've said you'd have sex with a black girl how old is she first of all  get her age she's 17 okay 17 she's legal have you said it before on this show there's oh you  might have said francine francine was always like i i would have i would have like done things with 
[01:53:30]  francine years ago and then that uh i was looking at that one in the studio down there you know that  one yeah she got a nice fucking body on her she's very i wave at her every day she's very lovely yeah  yeah yeah yeah and the old receptionist here was hot black girl oh yeah she was she was really  really pretty what happened to her because she has a white she doesn't have a black girl body that  that chick in there well she got the booty no it looks like a nice ass but it doesn't look like  it's not crazy ass it's it's a it's a baby booty it's not crazy black chick ass no way yeah 
[01:54:00]  gabby douglas got like gabby douglas got some crazy choppers on her though yeah she's got a cute  little small choppers what was the fucking 30 seconds we had to play someone fucking  wrote me said he got weird with her at the end of an interview or something oh really  yeah i forgot about that was it a race thing i don't know i don't remember she's the one that  was brought up by uh white people yep she our black family sent her off to live with white people  and they trained her to uh to uh do gymnastics right and then uh she wins the olympics and then

[02:13:30]  news every time  there's shenanigans  and hijinks going  on that's what i  call these terrorist  events shenanigans  hijinks and  chicanery you know  that's it's funny  because that's what  we call them inside  the agency too  yeah yeah  shenanigans  we have a special  task force for  shenanigans  el-qaeda is up to  more hijinks  yeah  those guys in  their fun times  yeah  oh boy  we're gonna  we're gonna give  mike baker  some one-on-one  time a little bit  but first we gotta  get to it could  either be nada  nada  it's nada 
[02:14:00]  or nadia  according to  roland  it's nada  nada  nada  nada  nada  nada  nada  nada  how you doing  nada  take a seat  right over there  next to uh  do you know  mike baker  hey  mike baker  he's a former  uh cia  he's an operative  yeah  and and he's still  and what a handsome  devil  yes  well that's why you  have me on  of course  i'm a handsome  devil  yes it brings up  the room a little  bit  i look good  sitting next to  jim  right  everyone looks  good sitting  next to me  oh jimmy 
[02:14:30]  not up a coast  promoting manhunt  the inside story  of the hunt  for osama bin laden  premiering tomorrow  on hbo  i get to see an  advanced copy  of that one  man uh  you realize  what went into  this  oh yes  a lot  a lot of  a lot of work  went into this  and i don't think  i think when you  watch something like  uh zero dark 30  uh it kind of  condenses it  you don't really get  a real appreciation  for how much work  went and how many  people were really  involved in uh  doing this  and and how long 
[02:15:00]  it took  that's what i think  is so good about  the documentary  is it really  exemplifies  that it takes a  village to do  this type of work  yeah  multiple agencies  involved as well  how accurate was  zero dark 30  as far as the  because i remember  in the in the book  about the seal  uh the seal  was it uh  no ordinary day  or whatever  no easy day  they they credit  or they said  it was a woman  who was really  targeting uh  bin laden  and you know  everybody thinks  that's such a  male thing  being in the cia  how accurate  was zero dark  30s the process  leading up to it  um i left 
[02:15:30]  before you know  they got bin laden  but um  from my perspective  zero dark 30  didn't exemplify  sort of how  intelligence works  it felt a little  bit more like  law enforcement  investigation  yeah and and a  little more uh  you know action  going on  they got it's a  movie they got  to gussy it up  because i don't  think an action  movie with a  bunch of um  you know kind of  housewifey looking  women sitting around  analyzing well i  gotta say  you should fight  back you should  right now  look i saw the 
[02:16:00]  movie i'm just  saying that a  movie gives you  the i am in such  trouble right now  a movie gives you  the impression that  there's these  schlumps bond  girls walking  around we all  look like jessica  kind of yeah then  they're kind of no  you're very attractive  believe me i'm not  talking about you  per se i was  talking about some  of the other women  in the analyst  no i can't get  it's done  before you  damn it  wow she stopped 
[02:16:30]  you oh that  wasn't even a  minute and i'm  off on the wrong  place  no i mean  well hollywood  pretties up  everything  they do  everything  we all know  that  and not all  the seals are  that hot  either  exactly  that's all  that's trying  to say  not every CIA  operative  is that it's  oh look  except for  mike baker  god damn  mike baker  gq model  mike baker  right  he dresses  gq too  what was really  interesting  out of that  for uh...  for the movie  the film  of zero dark thirty  was that 
[02:17:00]  the senate  up on capitol hill  seemed to have a hard time  understanding that it's a hollywood film  as opposed  to real world  real  because you know  they got upset about the interrogation  scenario where the filmmakers  appeared to leave it up to the viewers  ideas as to  did this work or not  right  and of course the senate  just finished putting out  a two million page  document  saying that there was  absolutely nothing gained  from interrogation techniques  yeah  and so then the senate  started demanding that the cia  come up and say  what did you tell those  film writers from hollywood  did you tell them secrets  that we didn't have 
[02:17:30]  but uh...  yeah  they kind of left it  a little vague  in the movie  how much of  how much uh...  what do they call it  some type of interrogation  uh...  they don't call it torture  yes yes  thank you  what do they call it  enhanced interrogation  that was the name of the program  yeah  how much of that was going on  to your knowledge  you got me  you got you  i think the misconception  with that  really  you know  the question keeps being asked  how much of that led up  to finding bin laden  yeah  when at the end of the day  that was just a piece 
[02:18:00]  of the puzzle  i mean there were so many  other issues  happening at the time  um  you know you're going  after the people  who are doing  the actual operational  planning  which was much more  important than getting  the figurehead  you know after 9-11  at that point  yeah  stopping plots  from maturing  well that's the interesting  part of the movie  also is you  you assume that  all right we're looking  for bin laden  the question is  where's bin laden  no  you have to look  so peripherally  to people that 
[02:18:30]  know people  that know people  that know people  and it goes back  to a messenger  somewhere  or you know  it's the most  innocent little thing  but it could lead you  to the next step  and the next step  so just very complex  uh investigation  that went on  what do you think  al-zohari  is that how you say  al-zohari  where do you think  he is  because i guess  now he's in charge  of al-qaeda right  yeah  he's he is a figurehead  at this point  where he is  i couldn't fathom  a guess at this point  brooklyn  brooklyn  somewhere in the boroughs 
[02:19:00]  yeah it'd be funny  because he's working  watching turns up there  we go like  mike told us  that was great  thanks mike  you heard it here first  yeah  what was your role  in the cia  to let people know  who you are  and what you did  um i was  i started out  as a traditional analyst  in the director  of intelligence  so that's where  the side where you write  you know publications  for the policy maker  like the president  and congress  and you're briefing  people on the hill  did you get guys  like mike coffee  yeah  oh my god  you definitely  you gotta walk over there  and just smack him 
[02:19:30]  oh my god  i'm totally kidding  i'm teasing of course  so um  then i moved over  to the operations side  and was a targeting officer  and what does that do  targeting officer  so um  you're  well your job  in the counterterrorism center  is basically looking  for terrorists  to kill or capture  would you  you'd write briefs  for the president  would you  how'd you brief them to  would you sit in the room  and  so they have  they have dedicated briefers  that are assigned 
[02:20:00]  to each principal  and i  i did not become a briefer  because i moved over  to the operations side  before i ever tried  one of those positions  but yes i wrote  many presidential daily briefs  too many  that's a lot of pressure  because you know  that you're writing  the information  to the guy  who really can  absolutely  one of the most  compelling parts  of the movie  is the fact that  there was so much  information pre 9-11  yet that one  just key  that that piece  wasn't there  to get all the info  you needed  to thwart this 
[02:20:30]  uh horrid event  uh  and in hindsight  it looks like  oh it's easy  it's all right here  but um  how much  pre 9-11  did you guys know  uh  like how close  did you get  to knowing  what was actually  going to happen  so i wasn't in  counterterrorism center  um before 9-11  i moved over  after 9-11  but  when you look  at the pdbs  that are out  and you know  you can see  some of the language  that's in the 9-11  what's a pdb  i know it is  but the audience  might know 
[02:21:00]  the presidential daily briefs  so you'll see those  in the documentary  i've read that myself  in case our audience  just for the layman  yeah  so that's  i mean  you actually see  the real pdbs  in the documentary  yeah  um  not knowing  the place and time  you know  makes  what are you going to do  how are you going to  really prepare  against something like that  at the same time  you know  you're getting  this intelligence  and that's the purpose  of the agency  is presenting intelligence  to the policy maker  so they then  can take action  upon that intelligence 
[02:21:30]  yeah  so  hindsight  you know  we didn't  no one really saw  bin laden  as that big a threat  until 9-11  did you think  the cia got  because i knew  as soon as those planes  hit i literally knew  it was osama bin laden  i remember  talking to my girlfriend  at the time  saying that's osama bin laden  i just knew it  and so there was  enough  shut up  yeah exactly  because i was pointing  at my other roommate  i thought it was him  i just didn't have  a very basic knowledge  of who was who  in the world  um  so people  so they kind of knew  that he was  a problem 
[02:22:00]  did you feel like  the cia got  thrown under the bus  uh for what happened  or the fbi  or how they  they quote unquote  didn't share information  was that  was that bullshit  that they didn't  share information  with each other  you know  there were  bureaucratic  walls up  i mean that  that was true  and um  i think the things  that they didn't  focus on  you know  as far as  you know  the blame game  it shouldn't have  been specific people  um  really the focus  should have been  on how do we  improve this  and what do we do  to make the process  better  and i think 
[02:22:30]  that continues  to happen today  where they're just  it's like the blame game  keeps going on  without really thinking  about how do we fix this  what we see in boston  what happened in boston  the blame game  and exactly  and if there's processes  in place that need to be fixed  let's focus on that first  people love a good blame though  oh do they love a good  well that was the problem  and if we get rid of that  then we won't get hit again  it gives you a sense of security  to know  that there was a problem  here it was  and if we get rid of it  or fix that problem  then we're safe  when in actuality  we're never really 
[02:23:00]  100% safe  absolutely  you know  it's kind of frightening  that's one of my biggest  the biggest takeaway  I want people to have  from this documentary  is understanding  how the agency  and national security works  there's not a crystal ball  there's no way  that you  you know  they can 100%  predict anything  so even police state  is not 100% secure  yeah  when you  when you work  in the level of security  that you obviously have  with intelligence  like you look at the pentagon  there's like levels  of the pentagon  where people can go  did you have a security clearance 
[02:23:30]  which would get you  into most places  in like the pentagon  if you work for the cia  you have to have  the highest security  clearances available  oh yeah  so you can pretty much  go anywhere  yeah you can't go  in that building  without the highest  just knock on the back door  of the white house  and get some coffee  there's separate  clearances for certain programs  something like that  so you may not  you may not be read  into certain programs  in which case  then that requires  additional tickets  to say okay  now I can  I understand this  but  yeah  oof  so why did you 
[02:24:00]  be the agency  what are you doing  freaking cool  I'm sorry  cloak and daggery  it was time  it was time  for me to go  I just started  realizing that  this was kind of  taking over my life  and I'm  it's gotta be  what are you doing now  so I'm working  on a book  trying to develop  a fiction TV series  loosely based on  my experience  and looking  for the next opportunity  and the NSA  and the CIA  there's always  the NSA  is considered  so secretive 
[02:24:30]  what's  what's the difference  in what one organization  knows  and what the other  organization knows  the difference  well they collect  different types  of information  they do different  types of analysis  you know  the CIA is focused  on human intelligence  and the NSA  is focused  on signal intelligence  are they really  intercepting all emails  and stuff like that  all of yours  oh that's fine  they just  they're like  why does this guy  keep sending out  pictures of his  junk that are not his  this guy's really 
[02:25:00]  trying to convince  somebody of something  they got a whole wall  of Jimmy's junk  in the bowels  of the NSA  the pyramid  and none of them  are mine  they're all  different sizes  oh boy  one thing also  that was  it was really  an amazing film  I really enjoyed it  the guilt  that came into play  with some of these  analysts that did have  a lot of information  but not those key pieces  to put it all together 
[02:25:30]  had this horrible  feeling of guilt  afterwards  that they  you know  did they try hard enough  did they dig deep enough  to try to find this info  how did  I mean you must have  spoken with these  people  how are they dealing  with it now  over time  did it get better  are they still  feeling that way  I think  you know  obviously  you're getting  this specific  first hand account  so everybody  had a different  reaction to that  you know  some of the  analysts  were still there  and the original  Al Qaeda analysts  they had a very 
[02:26:00]  different reaction  to how things  played out  after 9-11  some of them  didn't feel  that kind of  pressure  so  you know  I think  at this point  they just stayed  focused on their  jobs  the people  that are still  there  are still  doing this  work  do you think  women's roles  because they talk  about how women  make good analysts  but you typically  don't think of that  like you know  until recently  you don't normally  think that women  are smart enough  to be analysts  so what you're  saying Jim  no you don't  associate  like you know  whenever you see 
[02:26:30]  movies  you very rarely  see movies  where it's just  you know  a woman  pouring over data  who actually  nails the guy  it's always  you know  or Jane Bond  yeah you never  exactly  it's always some  debonair fellow  who figures it out  but do you think  like women's role  in intelligence  community  is kind of  now being seen  more accurately  that like it  should be seen  kind of  you know  I mean  because they do  men and women  all do  share the same  jobs  I mean  there's women  that are case  officers  there's men  that are analysts  who are just as good 
[02:27:00]  as you know  the woman sitting  next to them  so it's all  individual specific  I'm not sure  it's entirely  a gender issue  it's just that  starting out  in the counterterrorism  center  most of the  al-qaeda analysts  at the time  were women  they were drawn  to that work  well let's see  a woman analyze  when a text  comes in on your  phone  and she's able  to decode  the fucking  code that  you put on  your phone  find every text  find which  Facebook page  the girl is from  yeah  believe me  there's a problem  there  I think girls  make much better 
[02:27:30]  analysts  yeah  yeah  oh believe me  you're not hard  to figure out  you drink  excessively  and you hit  one one one  all right  didn't think  she'd try it  again  if I don't  change it  she'll think  I did  hide in plain sight  oh that is the  worst  did you work  for Starbucks  after the CIA  no  oh  no no  I think you meant  me  oh I thought  you meant Mike  you went from 
[02:28:00]  the CIA  to Starbucks  I worked in  their public  affairs office  for a while  yeah  she's not  pouring coffee  I don't know  that's why I'm  asking  it was a really  interesting job  Starbucks  was an  interesting job  why  I only quit  because I thought  I was moving  back to DC  and then I ended  up not doing  that so  oh man  how many years  with the CIA  almost 10  what did you do  before that  that like that  where they said  okay we think  you're qualified  to come in  and work  um  well I had done  some grad work  overseas  and I had worked  for um  some international  companies  some mining  companies 
[02:28:30]  oh boy  all right  we know what  that means  enough said  enough said  no shit  would you leave  the CIA  phone calls still  do they give you  a speech  or how do you  like what  do you have to  sign something  so you'll never  disclose what  you've learned  here or  or what is  what is it  that you do  when you leave  you get guard  rails  that you have  to stay in  between  a little  and you just  don't class  um  talk about  classified  information  timmy thinks  it's a reality  show  disclaimer  that you  got a sign  don't say  who won  the big  finale  don't tell 
[02:29:00]  him he's  dead  it seems  like you guys  are too scared  to talk  after you leave  the CIA  right Mike  Baker  no what  no but you  I mean some  people do  right some  people  you don't  you don't  hear about  guys  you don't  really hear  about a lot  of guys  actually talking  though outside  the guard  rails  occasionally  there'll be  you know  somebody who  and a lot  of times  you'll get  the anonymous  chatters  in the New York  Times  they can make  an entire  front page  story out  of anonymous  sources  nowadays  but no I  mean if you  if you've got  a sense of  patriotism and  responsibility and 
[02:29:30]  self-discipline  which theoretically  you should have  had if you got  into the agency  right then  you know you  know to keep  your yap shut  you don't talk  about things  or a real answer  they scare the  shit out of you  are you kidding  let me show you  what's going to  happen to you  if you talk  what do you  oh  Jimmy  the conspiracy  theorist  what's  with you  every day  no  we love 
[02:30:00]  Mike  he pops  in  yeah  what  why  you want  his number  right  he's a handsome  fella  Anthony was  going to say  what does  CIA stand  for  yes  oh that's  where you  work  that's  terrible  the conspiracy  theories that  have gone  around 9-11  are just  ridiculous and  stuff and  and you  having been  on the inside  and gotten  the intelligence  what's your 
[02:30:30]  take on those  people  I don't  I think  I think  conspiracies  to them  seem to make  more sense  than reality  for some  reason  and I don't  know why  yeah  no matter how  convoluted  the conspiracy  is  they'd  rather  connect  dots  that aren't  even close  to each  other  than just  look at  what was  the most  simple  explanation  when you  look at  the 9-11  conspiracies  in particular  because I've  been thinking  about this  it's like  it's like  they don't  want to  believe  that someone  can be  that evil  right  that someone  can hate  us  yes  and I 
[02:31:00]  think they  like to  think that  the government  itself  is this  umbrella  of protection  over us  that can't  be breached  so they  must have  been in  on it  have you  met this  government  yes  exactly  oh my  god  now  interesting  to read  this too  because I  kind of  became  obsessed  with  transsexuals  Jimmy does  like a good  transsexual  is there  any such  thing as  a bad  one  I think  not  I think  not  she's  uncomfortably 
[02:31:30]  drinking  her coffee  I can tell  you what  CIA stands  for in  that  situation  now  how do  you feel  about gender  Chris  you  Alzar  Cowie  kind of  became  because he  was the  one I  believe  where the  beheadings  started  that's who  you were  yeah  but that  had  happened  David  Pearl  unfortunately  KSM  was involved  with that  but I  mean  the ones  I guess  the ones  that became  this whole  you're right  Daniel Pearl  yeah  he was 
[02:32:00]  really a  frightening  guy to  me  more than  any of  them  Zarkari  was  terrifying  and they  finally  did you  catch him  or did  you help  find out  where he  was staying  when they  bunker  busted him  so  I was  part of  the  I was  the chief  of the  target  team  going  after him  and  I  actually  moved  to a  different  job  because I  needed  to  just a  few  months  before  they  caught  him  oh  man  but this  was a  good thing  like I said  this is a  team effort  right  you seem  to pull  out right  before the  big game  and I 
[02:32:30]  know that I  contributed  to all that  intel  we were  making very  bad decisions  like look  I think  he's in  France  we see  no indication  of that  there's a  guy in a  livery cab  in France  it's him  right  that was it  so how  did they  find  because there's  one thing  where they  were chasing  him  and I  remember  they got  his laptop  or something  they got  some  computer  information  I don't  know if  that actually  led to  his  but how  did they  finally get  him  he showed 
[02:33:00]  up to reclaim  it  is that my  laptop  how did they  finally figure  out where he  was  I mean I've  talked to  you know  General McChrystal  and several  people that  were intimately  involved in that  and the story  that he tells  in his book  is accurate  I didn't read it  oh well  I mean he talks  about the fact  that they were  able they actually  had a detainee  that talked  a little bit  about who he  was staying  with  who his couriers  were and  they were able  to ID  his  now those  detainees  of course  it's just  by you know  brushing their 
[02:33:30]  hair at night  and having  long talks  with them  pillow fights  and s'mores  pretty much it  yeah yeah  chatting and  developing a  relationship  with them  that's what  the FBI does  yeah  relationship  we sucked  at it  because we  wouldn't take  the time  to develop  a relationship  apparently  that's what  they say  but was  waterboarding  and stuff  like that  did it help  or did it  not help  at all  what's the  reality of that  it helps 
[02:34:00]  Mike  how could it  not help  it obviously  helps  I think Nader  should answer  that question  but I think  my opinion  is simply  that the world  is not black  and white  sometimes  you want  the tools  in your kit  bag  because  ultimately  if you tell  them what  you can do  then they'll  stay there  for the rest  of their lives  knowing what  you can do  and you never  win in that  situation  so you're  assuming you're  going to have  time to  eventually develop  their trust  or they're  just going to  lose it  because they're  in there  for so long  you've got to 
[02:34:30]  have those  tools in your  kit bag  and sometimes  they work  sometimes they  don't  but for the  Senate  Intelligence  Committee  to come out  and say  they never  ever  it just  defies belief  nothing's  never  so if you  get one of  the guys  that isn't  isn't giving  up any  information  using all  these other  tactics  maybe that'll  work  the biggest  part about  it is  you need  to keep  the uncertainty  in an  interrogation  program  but we've  told them 
[02:35:00]  what we can  and can't  do  and from  now going  forward  unless that  ever changes  I suspect  it won't  then  I'm not  going to  say anything  because they're  not going  to do  anything bad  because they  can't  but don't  they just  sometimes you  hear like they  take them from  Guantanamo  and they put  them somewhere  like there's  some guys that  were sent to  Jordan  and it isn't  that like in  a way like a  maybe their  intelligence officers  can do things  that technically  the CIA can't  if the CIA just  happens to be  sitting in so  then legally the  CIA didn't do  it  a Jordanian guy  did it and they 
[02:35:30]  don't have the  same fucking  annoying committees  who pulled his  toenails out of  the Jordanian guy  well  the bylaws are  allowed to do  that  did he talk  it's actually  a sign of  affection  Jordan  what did he  say after the  blood curdling  scream  wow  but you weren't  involved in any  of that kind of  stuff  yeah  now Alzar  Coway when  they got him  who took over  after him  because he was  killed pretty  quickly  yeah it was  his number  two  I mean he  had a whole  inner circle  that he came  into Iraq  with that he  had actually  had had in 
[02:36:00]  the 90s  at Harad  Afghanistan  so he  goes back  henchmen  or flunkies  minions  minions  lackeys  wow  so the  beheadings  do you think  that actually  because I  tell you  I performed  in Iraq  once and  it stopped  me from  going back  I did  it in  2003  and then  the beheading  started  and it  just  I was  like what  if I'm  in a  helicopter  going from  one base  to another  and we  go down  it just  scared me  too much  to go back  oh my god  yeah  Jim Norton  that would  be terrible  I know  you would have  charmed them  yeah but 
[02:36:30]  it wouldn't  even  here's the  humiliating part  it wouldn't  even put a  dent in  the comedy  community  nobody would  just blip  nothing  did that  change anything  for the way  you guys  did business  knowing that  the contractors  and stuff  were going to  face that  fate  well  all of his  brutality  you know  we certainly  had plenty  of incentive  to find him  but yeah  I mean the  beheadings  he was just  such a  brutal  person  you know  to go through  all of that 
[02:37:00]  and all the  hostages  and yeah  that was  incredibly  nerve-wracking  how long  before they  got Bin Laden  were you  out  I probably  have left  I had been  gone for at  least two  years  two years  now when  you heard  that he  was  when you  heard that  he was  killed  and how  it went  down  were you  able to  see any  of the  information  that you  had supplied  in that  mission  were you  able to  yourself  go oh  yeah  we kind  of knew  that that  was coming  or  I mean 
[02:37:30]  I knew  back in  2004  some of  the stuff  that we  had done  contributed  to  helping  find him  but  you know  when they  first got  him  my first  instinct  was this  is a good  thing  this might  be closure  for some  people  but at  the same  time  this isn't  going to  stop an  entire  organization  no no  I think  that was  a false  assumption  by some  people  that you  know  once you  get him  and then  it turned  out he's  just some  old guy  sitting there  watching  porn  little TV  watching porn  with really 
[02:38:00]  a very  limited  ability  to communicate  with anybody  either  so  you know  what good  he was  to the  organization  I think  it was  a good  kind of  taking off  the figurehead's  head  at that point  but  as far as  really  doing something  to  destabilize  the element  there  I don't know  I think  getting rid  of many  of the  core  members  has certainly  helped  destabilize  it's gotta  be frightening  for the  next guy  coming up  to know 
[02:38:30]  that the  guy you're  replacing  was driving  to fucking  dinner  and something  that wasn't  even visible  or you  couldn't hear  it  just blew  his car  up  that's gotta  be a little  nerve wracking  to a guy  when he  you know  or just  walking out  to take  out the  garbage  or whatever  it is  frightening  so that's  good  it's also  a good  recruiting  tool  because  there's  always  constant  headroom  right  yes  I know  with my  company  people always  ask  is there  a chance  to move  up  yes 
[02:39:00]  plenty  of room  for advancement  on those  recruiting  posters  that's  probably  what they  say  hey  look at that  were you surprised  he was in  Pakistan  or had you  suspected that  at that point  you know  guessing he could  have been  anywhere  wow  you really  had lost  track of him  though  after what  Tora Bora  but I wasn't  focusing on  specifically on  Bin Laden  right  how close  was Bush  to getting  him  wasn't there  one point  where they  said  that Bush  was really 
[02:39:30]  close  in like 2001  or the end  of 2002  and what  happened  why didn't  that come  you know  he just  got word  or he got  out in time  or what  was it  I mean  you may be  talking about  Tora Bora  oh of course  yeah  and that  was an  incredibly  successful  strategic mission  to go in  there and  do exactly  what we  want to  do  which  was  route  the Taliban  and  you know  try to  kill as  many  of those  responsible  for 9-11  as possible  and that  worked very 
[02:40:00]  well  but you  have to  understand  it's like  the mountains  of the moon  and so  people say  oh my god  how come you  couldn't find him  he's a tall  dude  and he's  over there  and you  should have  gotten him  and it's  the same  thing  with  everything  right  right after  Boston  now we've  got a nation  full of  counterterrorism  experts  yeah  and so  it just  happens  it's understandable  because people  are so emotionally  invested  and I think  people can't  really conceive  in their head  what that  mountain range  looks like  and you just  think well  it's a little  mountain cave  and you fire 
[02:40:30]  a missile in  and he's dead  fly over the  Rockies  and look down  and be like  well a guy  is somewhere  in that  it gets a little  complicated  but I mean  I'm from Montana  and the mountains  there are intimidating  but when you're  in Afghanistan  those are crazy  mountains  crazy mountains  stop with your  technical jargon  yeah exactly  I think he's  in the crazy mountains  somewhere in the  crazy mountains  there is a mountain  range in Montana  called the crazies  is there the crazies  would the presidential 
[02:41:00]  briefs have that  official language  in it  those are some  crazy mountains  and remember  not all Tetons  are Grand Tetons  what does she mean  when she says  we're shit out of luck  what does that mean  oh my god  did you ever make  a mistake in a  brief that you  look back on  and you say  I briefed them  and we found out  the information  was incorrect  and you had to  go back and  correct it  never  nah there you go  when you write  a product  it goes through  lots of coordination  and I  mine typically  went out to  large part of  CTC before 
[02:41:30]  because it was  touching big topics  in our office  not even a mistake  you personally made  like when you  look back  like they thought  when calling  Colin Powell  was you know  in the UN  saying that  it was a uranium  truck  and it turns out  what was it  you know  fucking  hot dog sale  that's a good  question  I was on the team  on the analytical side  at the time  looking at evaluating  Iraq's connection  to 9-11 and Al-Qaeda  and we didn't find one  did the government  press you to find  a connection  and we didn't  well I mean  we did our job  right  and it was 
[02:42:00]  we did have  an unusual  experience  with the government  I mean  having the vice president  come to the agency  is not typical  at the end of the day  we stood our ground  and said  this is our objective  evaluation of  the fact that  we don't believe  Iraq has a connection  to 9-11 and Al-Qaeda  so it didn't change  our analysis  so the vice president  came to  so Cheney came  and what did he say  hi  how are you  hi  yeah  where's that connection 
[02:42:30]  Neda  be more accurate  did he say  find a connection  and then just kind of  like please  find a connection  please  what do you got there  that was the odd part  about this right  I mean typically  when you're looking  at intelligence  you're building a picture  based on the information  that's coming in  you're not  you're not starting out  with this  conclusion  conclusion  exactly  so you know  then we're going  from there  and trying to figure  out what every  yeah  so that was  that was unusual  yeah  wow  so they  did they  I mean again 
[02:43:00]  I know hindsight  did they really believe  that Iraq was involved  or was it  now we're in this position  we kind of have to  figure out if they were  you know  I mean I can't speak  for what the administration  believed  but we told them  they were not  and they knew that  prior to the invasion  and our bottom line  had been delivered  prior to that  so the CIA  had told them  and  they still went in  they still went in  but who cares  but that makes  she makes a really  important point  which is that  the agency  people don't believe it  because of all the movies  and the books  but the agency  is very apolitical  right  you just march on 
[02:43:30]  regardless of which  administration is there  but the problem is  when that information  that you know  Nate is producing  then goes  into the washing machine  of the intel community  and over to the White House  and then it starts  getting edited  and shaped  and shifted around  and that's when  that's when people say  well my god  this is what they said  well it's not what  the agency said  right right  it was shaped  for their own devices  well don't they ask  for raw data  like you know  because Obama's been  much tougher  on foreign terrorism  than I thought  he was going to be  like as far as 
[02:44:00]  targeting people  with drones  which I love  who is it  Awalaki  the guy  the American citizen  that they said  they shouldn't do  and he was like  we're going to kill him  anyway  and they killed him  hmm  I don't know  I mean  there's been some  there's been some good  you know  but I don't see  he loves Predator drones  he loves them  he's down inside  out of mine  then he should have  sent one over  to fucking Benghazi  maybe  you know  within those hours  and hours  that went by  yeah  alright  that was a bit 
[02:44:30]  of a blunder  thanks to fucking  Hillary  didn't really help  but you know  well she had nothing  to do with  oh that's right  that paper was signed  by her  whoops  the only one  that could have  called that in  was Obama  yeah  we're talking about  Benghazi  he's the only person  that could have done that  and he chose not to  he couldn't be bothered  that was a movie  right  would these guys  campaign on a certain way  they campaign a certain way  and then all of a sudden  they start acting  a different way  is there a way  like a candidate  just doesn't get  the information  that an elected  president gets  like as the  as the candidate 
[02:45:00]  you think you would do this  and then when you're  in office  you find out a lot  that you're just  quite privy to  I mean is that one reason  that these guys  kind of change  whatever their position  is when they get  to a certain place  oh they have a learning curve  I mean that  that has  I would hope  they would learn something  once they got into office  because you get  somebody like Obama  that was dead set  against Guantanamo  we're going to  shut that down  and the first thing I do  and you know  even just withdraw  the troops immediately  and then he gets in  and I would gather  he's briefed 
[02:45:30]  and then he goes  oh shit  we can't do that  yeah  that's got to be  quite a shocker to him  yeah  well the documentary  was very good  it's called  yeah  it's a manhunt  the inside story  of the hunt  for Osama bin Laden  and it's tomorrow  night on HBO  and it's really interesting  to see all these  analysts talking  and it's very concise  which I liked about it too  it's you know  a lot of times  you get these  kind of loose ends  with documentaries  you're like  what is that though 
[02:46:00]  I want to know  a little more  it really does  walk you right through  you know  the events  leading up to 9-11  and then  after 9-11  the hunt  for this bastard  what I like about it  is it's storytelling  and it's the first hand  account  so it's  I think Greg Barker  the director  kept it fairly apolitical  because he just let us  talk about our experiences  you know  it's through our lenses  and it's for the audience  to decide whether or not  they'd agree or disagree  with the subject matter  and how we felt  but he kept the political 
[02:46:30]  discussion out of it  which I thought was  great  yeah very fact based  you know  it's not really  open for interpretation  it's here's what happened  right  here it is  from our point of view  yeah definitely  and you're on twitter  you're Neda Bakos  am I saying it right  what kind of name is it  Bakos is Polish  okay  N-A-D-A-B-A-K-O-S  I thought Greek too  sounds a little Greek  everyone does  anytime there's a K  I don't know what it is  Neda Bakos  on  I don't know how to say it 
[02:47:00]  N-A-D-A-B-A-K-O-S  Neda Bakos  that's a cool name  it's Neda right  Neda  Neda not Neda  Neda means nothing  that's terrible  well you said that earlier  no I didn't  Neda Bakos  where's it Bakos  it doesn't matter  oh you say Bakos  too many times  Iraq gets all  he thinks he's sprinkling  on his salad  I want to say  Neda Bakos  Neda Bakos  Neda Bakos  Neda Bakos  yeah  alright  very good  thank you so much  and I definitely  recommend the film 
[02:47:30]  it's great  it's going to be on HBO  tomorrow night  tomorrow night  cool thanks for coming in  and we'll be back  I want to talk to Mike  about the Boston  Boston antics  hijinks  and shenanigans  that went on up there  and a few other things  I'm here  thanks man  the Opie and Anthony  show will return  in a moment  after all  millionaires have been pissed too  I guess we're back 
[02:48:00]  uh yeah  well we don't want to  waste time here  we got Mike Bigger in the studio  yes  Mike  I want to dive right into  the Boston situation  by the way  Neda was wrong  we do have a crystal ball 
[02:48:30]  at the agency  oh she didn't know that  yeah we keep it on the  seventh floor  occasionally it gets consulted  you know  can I ask one question  can I ask one question  about the interview  yeah  uh she didn't really  answer anything  and she almost gave the  um  you know  the appearance that she  doesn't know much  well no  she  I mean  she was nice and all  but she didn't really  offer up much of anything  what's that about  well you know what  it's just  you know what it is  it's uh it's her  it's her way of  of talking about  what she used to do  I guarantee you 
[02:49:00]  she knows a lot  she's a very  very smart person  yeah  you know and  and was in there  at the outfit  at a very interesting time  sure  but you know  some people get out  and it's an awkward  thing for them  to talk about  this thing  um  I'll suck all the oxygen  out of the room  as long as I'm not  talking about  sources and methods  but there's a way  that you can talk  about your time  and there's a way  that you can talk  about what the agency  does  but you're not  releasing any  sources and methods  she's probably not  used to that  aspect of it yet  it seems hard  to talk about your job  and we've talked  to you about it  over the years 
[02:49:30]  that you have  like one of the  coolest jobs  you could ever have  and you really  can't talk about  what you did  right  occasionally  you'll find  occasionally  you'll find  that something  gets declassified  you know an operation  right  and then you're all in  like I got some stories  like you know  I'll get a call  from somebody  and say did you see  that somebody's  talking about that  and then you find  out that you really  they open their mouth  about that  and so then you realize  okay but you still  don't want to  you know you still  don't want to jump  on the bandwagon  and start throwing  shit out there  so how do you brag  I mean every  every guy likes to brag 
[02:50:00]  about whatever the fuck  so I just point to my  Johnson  but do you get together  with the guys  and over a barbecue  in the middle of a  fucking desert  so no one can hear you  fucking brag a little  you know what  you don't  you don't really  you know what I mean  no  that's gonna suck  remember that time  I pulled your ass  out of that  I think you know  what I'm saying  comparing your scars  it's gotta suck  because I know  that you probably  have some amazing  stories and you  have to pretty much  like she said  keep it between  the guardrails 
[02:50:30]  yeah  and you do  but also the thing  is you don't  you don't go to work  at the outfit  particularly  well you know  in all the directorates  but you know  I can speak  for the operations  group  you don't go  to work there  if what you're  looking for  is you know  somebody to pat  you on the back  and you know  get affirmation  constantly about  the shit  because you don't  same as here  yeah  it's not that  you need a pat  on the back  it's just like  you got  you had a cool job  and you really  got to keep  most of it  under wraps  right  with that said  what's up 
[02:51:00]  with the Boston  Marathon bombing  you think there's  more people involved  yeah definitely  wow  I think it's  well when I say  that let me  let me qualify that  I don't  I think it's  inconceivable  that anybody  at this point  unless they're  just stupid  or they're  following some  you know  policy line  would say  that Tamerlan  the now dead  older brother  didn't receive  training while  he was over  in Dagestan  right  and so  when I say  there's other  people involved  I'm not saying  necessarily  there's a  support cell  sitting in  you know  Watertown  or somewhere  that helped  him construct  these things  but what I am  saying is 
[02:51:30]  that look  the guy  they started  to self-radicalize  right  and then  because of the  connections to  Chechnya  and Dagestan  where the mom  was from  these two  if I'm a  jihadist  these are  exactly who  I'm looking  for  just like  if I'm a  Chinese intel  officer  I'm looking  for a  Chinese-American  to target  right  exactly  there shouldn't  be any mystery  there  because you're  looking for  leverage  you're looking  for some  touch point  that you can  influence them  and the  jihadists  for a long  time now  and I'm not  just talking  about Al-Qaeda  but radical  Islam  for years now  have been making 
[02:52:00]  a very aggressive  concerted effort  to reach out  and influence  usually through  social media  and internet  and the ramblings  of the psychotic  imams that they've got  to influence people  just like these brothers  and whether they  self-radicalize  through all the  work that the  extremists put out there  or whether they  actually then make  contact like Tamerlan did  and they get training  and they get some  resources  it doesn't matter  because the end game  is still the same  you get a terrorist  who commits an act  exactly  and now you've got  the guys  already here  that you're influencing 
[02:52:30]  you don't have to  now go through  the step  which is pretty  hard these days  of importing  someone to the  United States  they're already here  it's a lot easier  to electrically  connect with this  person  and they've done  this in Europe  they've had successful  attacks in England  and Spain  and France  they've even said  that this is what  they're trying to do  they've said  we need to get  people that are  already there  and the lone wolf  the bombs were  more complicated  than we first thought  you don't just 
[02:53:00]  put this together  no you would have  to try it out  a little bit  and figure out  some things  and it's not a  guarantee it's going  to work on the  first try  so they're trying  to figure out  where the fuck  were they practicing  this shit  and trying it out  to make sure  they got everything  right before they  placed the bombs  yeah not like  the pipe bomb  in a planter  kind of a thing  this wasn't one  of those  it was pretty  sophisticated  as far as  the electronic  device  but at first  the media  was saying  it's so easy  you can just  read about it  on the internet  and the next thing  you know  it's going to happen  now they're starting  to say there's no way  you really got to  know what the fuck  you're doing 
[02:53:30]  the entire media  now is all  action to action  right  how come you  weren't on top  of these guys  breaking the  constitution  and doing more  and surveilling them  when you had no  cause  that's something  the FBI's been  getting kicked  in the ass  constantly  because of this  and here's  the thing  that I'm amazed  at  a lot of the media  standing around  saying well look  the Russians  they tried to help  us  they tried to help  us  well the Russians  you know  they've had a brutal  conflict with Chechnya  for years  it's a separatist issue  they don't give a shit  about radical Islam  they care about  the separatist issue  right from their  perspective  in Dagestan 
[02:54:00]  it's the same way  Dagestan's got  a really serious  radical Islam problem  but they've got  the same concerns  there  so here's what  the Russians  have been trying  to do for  quite a while  they've been trying  to link the  separatist issue  with terrorism  so that everything  they do  in Chechnya  they can put  under the banner  of a war on terror  so they can go  in there  and blow the shit  out of the place  and say  what's the war on terror  and now the White House  has been completely  played by Putin  yet again  who you know  the White House  is now touting  well we've got  this new aggressive  cooperation with Russia  on the war on terror  Putin has got to be 
[02:54:30]  just sitting in his office  jacking off  happy as a clam  right  we can now just  do whatever we want  with these guys  with impunity  and the Russians  were wiretapping  this guy  I guarantee you  they gave a name  and a date of birth  and said  do you have anything  and I guarantee you  by that time  they already had a file  because they'd been  tapping him  and then  he goes over to Dagestan  you don't think  that the Russians  were crawling up his ass  the whole time  he's over there  they got a massive file  on what he was doing  he came back here  in 2012  and of course  they couldn't be bothered  not that we expect  our allies  to help us out  in any way  but it's the war on terror 
[02:55:00]  but meanwhile  everybody sits around  and goes  well the Russians  were trying to help  and the FBI  fucked up  and dropped the ball  yeah  I don't get it  no one digs that deep  into the story  all they see is  well the Russians  tried to help  and we dropped the ball  yeah  but God bless  those Russians  Putin's always  helping us out  well the kid's mother  said he didn't do it  oh God  that woman  and now she  apparently was on  a terror watch list  she  she had to leave the country  because of shoplifting 
[02:55:30]  there was a phone  what did she shoplift  dresses  that's it  Lord and Taylor  apparently she boosted  she went into a dressing room  and boosted  like six  six high end dresses  you know  cut the security tags  off of them  and tried to walk  out the door  and they got her  yeah she showed up  for a couple of court  appearances  and then the last one  I guess she just got  bored and she left  the country  isn't that a coincidence  too that the  the cameras on the  Lord and Taylor  outside of the marathon  were some of the  cameras used to  identify these sons 
[02:56:00]  see  conspiracy theory  little vengeance  yeah  I think it's more karma  she robbed from  Lord and Taylor  Lord and Taylor  robbed her of  one of her sons  if not both  good  and what about  the female DNA  found on the bomb  oh yeah  well you know what  that could be  that could be  pretty much anything  right  it could be  a sales clerk  who sold the thing  it could be  so why are they  releasing that like that  knowing that it could be  pretty much anything  at this point  well I don't think  you just can't keep  any freaking secrets  anymore  right  I mean the media  has got this 
[02:56:30]  this insatiable  desire for information  but where are they  getting the info from  someone's talking  somebody talks  I know exactly  they're always talking  and then the media  goes with it  right  and we saw that  from the very beginning  once those explosions  touched off  you know they were  constantly misreporting  information  yes yes  do you think  our sources are  telling us  do you think  these brothers  truly thought  they could have  been in disguise  like that  and the cameras  weren't going to  pick up a good  shot of them  or they didn't  give a fuck  I think that they  probably just 
[02:57:00]  weren't that clever  they put hats on  and one guy  had the sunglasses  on they thought  that was going  to be good enough  in this day and age  it doesn't make  a lot of sense  when you're logical  but if you're studying  this shit  and you're trying  to figure it all out  they're not Lex Luthor  that piece of the puzzle  seems a little strange  to me  yeah but that's  see the problem  is that  in fact you could  look at all these  characters  and say that  frankly  whether it's  the underwear bomber  whether it's  the ones who have  successfully carried  out attacks in Europe  none of them  are rocket scientists 
[02:57:30]  but the al-Qaeda  could care less  or the radical Islam  could care less  they get these guys  to do this  and it's not like  they're worried about  well okay  we're going to spend  a lot of time  with you Tamerlan  talking about  your getaway plan  they don't give a shit  whether he gets away  it doesn't matter to them  they don't mind  but didn't they not  take responsibility  for this or did they  al-Qaeda  no well not yet  no  why hasn't anybody  well why bother  really  and this is a far  reaching issue  this is not  we got ourselves  in a box  talking about al-Qaeda  like that's it  there's just al-Qaeda  over and above that 
[02:58:00]  is radical Islam  and al-Qaeda  is an element of that  and there's others  with the same  sort of agenda  you know  let's create a caliphate  and kill all the infidels  there's  so it's  when we talk about al-Qaeda  we do kind of  limit ourselves  there's other organizations  out there  but above it all  is this  you can't call it  a theology  but there's this  idea of radical Islam  extremism  that's out there  looking to kill  as many infidels  as possible  yeah I don't understand  why we need  this connection  with these card  carrying al-Qaeda members  when if al-Qaeda 
[02:58:30]  and radical Islam  influences these people  like these two brothers  what's the difference  it's just become semantics  at that point  no  sorry to interrupt you  yes please  here's what it is  it's because the cowards  in the government  are so afraid  at being misconstrued  as vilifying Islam  to mention that  it's a Muslim  or it's Islamic radical  pins it to the religion  al-Qaeda  pins it to an organization  it's a phony 
[02:59:00]  phony act of power  you're absolutely right  that's absolutely right  great point  I mean the first thing  we heard from the president  was don't jump to conclusions  this could be a disgruntled  tax filing  yeah yeah yeah  we heard that  all over MSMDC  yeah  well it could be  a Tea Party member  because it's a tax day  it could be  it could be somebody  I just moved to Idaho  a few months ago  it could be somebody  from Idaho  that's what they were implying  it could be my grandmother  dragging it with her cut lips  but we all know it's not  we all know 
[02:59:30]  it is a radical Islamic member  everyone knows  by the way  that is not an approved  delivery mechanism  how many times  you come across that  yeah  you hardly ever see that  everybody knew  what it was  yeah  everybody knew  don't jump  the last time  I jumped to conclusions  incorrectly  was the  was the fuck it  with the Muir building  in Oklahoma City  that was the last time  I was incorrect  I was over in North Africa  then we were doing operations  and in fact  involving Bin Laden  and you remember  when that Oklahoma bombing was  so when you talk about 
[03:00:00]  do people feel bad  about what happened  because 9-11  and then you think  did you miss a piece  of information  there were a lot  of opportunities  to tap at Bin Laden  but there was no consensus  despite when a couple  of people came out  and said  no we just knew  well they're talking  out of their ass  there was no consensus  but point being  we were doing  operations over  in North Africa  and we got that news  of the Oklahoma bombing  and our assumption 
[03:00:30]  immediately  was  yeah  it's got to be  these guys  wow  and then of course  you prove them wrong  and talk about a stunner  I still remember  exactly where I was  who I was with  what was happening  when we found out  that it was  Timothy McVeigh  wow  domestic  unbelievable  shit  how early on  were people  was anybody  clamoring  to take Bin Laden  out  was it  well before  9-11  well there were  people who  would like to  have done something  to remove him 
[03:01:00]  but  there just wasn't  there wasn't  the political will  but there also  wasn't the understanding  of  I don't know  it's tough to say  it's in hindsight  obviously hindsight  everybody's saying  we should have  crawled up  you know  the Tsarnaev's ass  and you know  follow them  and we would have  prevented Boston  but that's not  how the world works  when did he officially  become a problem  for the United States  obviously the 93 attack  yeah  but we knew  he was a problem  before that right  he was  I mean because  he was a prime  you know  financer  you know  for extremists 
[03:01:30]  and you know  certainly for  so what year was that  when he was definitely  on our radar  as a bad fucking dude  you know  shit  you'd have to go back  to the beginning  of the 90s  basically  when people really  started focusing  and paying attention  and saying  you know  there's his character  and it's interesting  because he comes  from this really  wealthy Saudi family  and he's dumping  a lot of money  into very unusual  organizations  so it took 20 years  that's why I'm asking  yeah  it took 20 years  to finally get him  but his name  really started coming up  after the first  trade center bombing  you started really  hearing about him 
[03:02:00]  and then the coal  but even at that point  there still wasn't  necessarily the understanding  as to you know  because for a long time  people thought  he was just the cash bag man  you know  yes  right  but no I mean  yeah hindsight's  a lovely thing  we should have  we should have  terminated him  you know  a long time ago  but you know  again  it's not  it's not how things work  yeah  you know  and it's not  as Neda was saying  you know  it just  it can sometimes  be very frustrating  when particularly  after the Boston attack  or any other operation  that goes out  and people 
[03:02:30]  you know  suddenly  you know  they're an expert  and they want to tell you  this is how  I think everybody  should have to do some time  in the government  or in the military  I think a one year  or two year service  I think it should be mandatory  and then you get rid of  a lot of these conspiracy  you'll get a bigger  understanding of  what's going on  has there ever been  because I always watch  and recently  I've watched  interviews with Bin Laden  video interviews  news interviews  where I guess  it was Peter Arnett  met with him at one point  and stuff  and they had camera crews  and everything  has there ever been  talk 
[03:03:00]  a little scuttlebutt  in the agency  of sending  a fake news crew  really trying to garner  a relationship  and get a news crew  in there  that his sole purpose  is to assassinate  that person  that's a clever idea  and I'm going to  I'm going to put that forward  we have a suggestion box  that's just outside  the agency  and I'm going to  drive by  and drop that off  because that's a  that's a hell of an idea  smart ass  God bless you  for coming up with that  I don't know  what the hell  we were doing  anything I could do 
[03:03:30]  to help my country  thank God  Mike I'm right on it  so what you're saying  is a news crew  a news crew  a documentary crew  right  no  it's a great idea  no  believe me  we do anything  we can do  anything the agency  can do  they will  they will consider  but there's a risk  versus gain  and there's a lot  the CIA  is the most  and people are going  to laugh about this  but the CIA  is the most transparent  intel organization  in the world  we've got more  checks and balances  on us  than any other  intel service  around the world 
[03:04:00]  and  you know  but they're  an incredibly creative  operation  and the operations  side  you know  it's amazing  some of the crap  that they do  but it's always after  this risk versus gain  right  and they look at it  so yeah  ideas like that  what you're talking about  believe me  there are sessions  where you're sitting around  thinking what's our objective  what's our task  hey  okay  who's got an idea  and you're just  throwing shit out there  right  and you'd be surprised  what I mean  some of the crap  that's happened  I have an idea  how about the next time  one of those news things  is happening  you put some sort 
[03:04:30]  of a very small  tracking device  in the camera  so when the news people  go to do the interview  you've got a readout  of exactly where they are  oh my  well you remember  what happened  just before  9-11  you know  with the Afghan  we had a guy named  Masud  who was an Afghan  well warlord  basically  but he was our warlord  damn it  and he was  a very influential character  and essentially  what happened  was prior  just prior to 9-11  Al Qaeda  blew him 
[03:05:00]  to hell  by a camera  that went  to interview him  and he had  the explosive device  in the camera  and they  you know  they touched it off  during the interview  and it was  wow  and you look at that  and that was  just prior to 9-11  but who's going  to look at that  and go  well you know what  I'll bet that's  a precursor  to flying planes  into these buildings  we took off  candid cameras  Fannie Flag  is out here  with an explosive camera  watch as the  funded hijinks  start 
[03:05:30]  what is this  tracking device  not one that blows up  yeah well I like  the one that blows up  better  yeah the old  exploding camera gag  you can't  some of these people  you just can't kill  quick enough  I hate to say that  but I don't hate to say that  it was the guy  that Israel got  with a phone  they mugged him  and they put  an exploding cell phone  in  and Mugnia  yeah  that's fantastic  held it right up  to his head  that was another thing  that was fantastic  because here we had  Hillary Clinton  was just there  was just in Damascus 
[03:06:00]  in Syria  right  talking about  how she loved  you know  oh this Assad  he's a linchpin  here to the Middle East  peace process  meanwhile Mugnia  who was one of the  one of the worst  of the worst  terrorists  was basically  living in public  in Damascus  yeah  and so Hillary Clinton  leaves  and shortly after she leaves  Mugnia's walking out  of a school function  and is just  you know  blown to shit  and you know  but there was nothing  from the White House  saying well  I can't believe Assad  was harboring this 
[03:06:30]  incredibly bloodthirsty  terrorist  that doesn't make any sense  no they didn't do it  and we didn't even get  a chance to talk about  Syria  which is a complete mess  yeah yeah  I know  yeah Syria  well quickly  do you think  there's chemical weapons  being used now  at this point  yeah I think  I think  the white foam  coming out of the mouth  Obama set a red line  yeah  and let me tell you  I got three little boys  the middle one  Sluggo  who's three and a half  if I give him a red line  and he crosses it  I better kick his ass  right  because otherwise 
[03:07:00]  I'm done  right  I'm Sluggo's bitch  for the rest of his  natural born life  and it just happens  and so  and so I think  Obama sets this red line  and now they're in a box  now they don't know  what to do  and now you're not really  they are keeping the cover  on this one  they're not really  talking about it  meanwhile it's like  well it was just a little bit  of chemical weapons  yeah  and you know what it's like  saying  it's like saying  if you use chemical weapons 
[03:07:30]  to kill your citizens  then bad things  are going to happen  but if you want to kill them  in any other fashion  yeah  yeah  go to town  yeah  that's okay  so he's done this  you know  there's all sorts  of problems here  the rebel opposition  which at the outset  of this whole conflict  over two years ago  was actually legitimate  has now been overrun  by al-Qaeda  and extremists  and others  we have no confidence  that you know  anything we do  would have leverage  on them  they're just looking  to say  look this is our next  playground  right  Assad's got  one of the world's  finest air defense systems 
[03:08:00]  courtesy of Putin  and the Russians  and so it's not as simple  as just saying  hey we're going to fly in there  the Israelis are going to fly in there  we're going to take out  these chemical weapons stores  it doesn't work that way  so they've got a serious problem  going on here  and now the longer  this goes on  also the more bad elements  get in there  on the opposition side  to get their little piece  or you know  so if they think  after this revolution  there's going to be  this stable  right  country  that's got another  you know  hey another bunch of  it's like the 
[03:08:30]  you know  situation in Egypt  yeah  how many Christians  can we kill today  yeah  thank god we live in America  oh yeah  sounds exhausting  to live anywhere else  that's why I moved to Idaho  it's  you don't have any  crises  how is Idaho  it's fantastic  what's good about Idaho  oh my god  well  the first thing is  it's as simple as pie  to get your concealed carry permit  yeah  so  and then it's the fishing  the hunting  the rafting  the climbing  the skiing  is insane  the people are terrific  it's 
[03:09:00]  you know  Boise  which is the largest  town there  is a great town  and the scenery  is fabulous  so  you know  it's  what can I say  it's a great place  it's a great place  I'm not just saying that  but you've got a huge fan base  I will say that much in Idaho  yeah  oh cool  let's go to Idaho  and we should  we should do the show  in Idaho  take a little visit  you got a big house  a big house  you know  I saw  we just invited him  to do a show  from Mike's house  I sold my house  you got a pool  what do you got  I sold my house  in Connecticut  yeah  pond's good for you  yeah 
[03:09:30]  I will say  real estate prices  in Idaho  are a little different  than Connecticut  I don't doubt  it's that whole  leaving your whole family behind  obviously better places live  but then you gotta  leave the family behind  which sucks  actually I didn't  I moved the family with me  oh the whole family  I do take this  another way though  what the fuck  does Mike know  that he's moving to Idaho  no kidding  but I didn't want to say that  I think it was obvious  to everybody in the room  I think  I want all the listeners

[03:16:00]  theories at first  and then he did  more research  and said no  fucking way  he's extremely  knowledgeable  on 9-11  everything leading  up to it  and afterwards  yeah  it's impressive  we'll talk more  playgola  what  we'll talk more  playgola later  sporting goods  shit  I need like  lacrosse stuff  I need a couple  soccer balls  and I got a  three year old  so whatever  three year old  kids are out  how many girls  are kids  how many girls  are boys  it's about half and half  so make sure  there's some little  pants in there too  kids wear little 
[03:16:30]  pants  alright carry on  alright have a great  day  what was the name  of the  not Mike Baker  what was the name  of the guest  that was in today  Nadia  what was her name  Nadia  Narnia  Nadia  Nadia  Nadia  Nadia  Nadia  Nadia  Nadia  Travis came in here  and said  well Roland said  it's Nadia  Bakos  and Mike Baker  was like  that's not her name  that's incorrect  that is not her name  yeah  just sit here 
[03:17:00]  say  it's Nada  Nada  Bakos  oh whatever  yeah there's no  I in there  for Nadia  Mike  you want a big show  the Models guy  you excited now  I know what I have  to do  what  you gotta do  what you gotta do  yeah you gotta get  some  even if you have  to go down  and buy  sporting goods  yourself  are you willing  to do that  yeah  you'll do that  yeah  it's that important  for you to get  this dude on the show  yeah  why  tell you after the show 
[03:17:30]  connections huh  they keep people happy  I guess so  I can't imagine  being in your world  you don't want to be  no  no  I mean I'm very bad  at keeping people happy  there's nothing  all that happens for me  is people get annoyed  with me  I don't know anything  about keeping people happy  that's your whole world  huh  yeah  just making sure  everybody's happy  yeah  then down the road  oh we have these  massive summer films  you get sick of it  don't you ever want to  just step away from it  and say I don't want to 
[03:18:00]  I don't want to deal  with this bullshit anymore  I'm not  I'm not going to sit here  and worry about  who's happy with me  I need to be just  just be able to be myself  the minute you think of that  you're done  that's it  that's it  you can't get into that headspace  you can  you just gotta go  okay this is what I sign up for  and you've been doing it  it's like the army  this is what you sign up for  this is what you sign up for  this is your specialty  how long have you been doing it for  two fucking long  oh my god  866  wow one wow  10 years long  you've been doing this for  10 years  oh Jesus yeah  has it aged you  yeah 
[03:18:30]  it has  that's what the doctor said  that's why I lost my hair  stress  the doctor said you  he said you lost your  hair loss was  they did all these tests  and everything  he said you have to  have a stress  he said switch jobs  I'm like oh great  I'll have more stress  have you made any friends  for what  in this job  yeah you make friends  but are they  no like real friends  not like  you probably have people  that come and go  and you probably have people  who like you today  because you can get them  on the show or whatever  but do you have any people  who you're like 
[03:19:00]  yeah that's my buddy  that's my friend  yeah about like a handful  a small handful  how quickly can you tell  when you're building  these relationships  because that's your  whole job rolling  you're the talent booker here  so all you do  is sit here  and build relationships  whether it's building  relationships with  Opie and Anthony  so you can  you know make sure  that you not only  give them what they want  but you got to know  how to talk to them  so that they can give you  what you want  slight little plagola  right  slight little plagola  in every now and then  yeah  but you have to establish 
[03:19:30]  these relationships  but then the big part  is going through  and trying to  establish relationships  with publicists  so when Opie, Anthony, Jim  say why don't we have  this guest  you know who to call  yeah or put out fires  if something goes wrong  and that happens  a lot around here  yeah  you probably have to  put out more fires  than most talent bookers  yeah  would you say that you  working for this show  is more stressful  than working for most shows  yes  why  be able to put more fires  that's it  and is that  that's the tough part  yeah  because that's 
[03:20:00]  the cost of that  mmhmm  it's a lot  now  is it  would you say  you have to put out  a fire  when you don't know  what the name  of the guest is  for instance  Nadia Bakos  nah  that's fine  that's fine  oh man  Roland just got nervous  and broke the string  his ID card was on  am I making you uncomfortable  you don't like talking  about this  no  why not  I don't know  you just don't know  who's listening  yeah that's right  and you don't know  you can't name  who's in your handful  because they'll be like  well why didn't you  mention me  and then all of a sudden 
[03:20:30]  you've upset somebody  and you can't upset  anybody can you  I took a friend  to dinner  just a friend  we were eating dinner  and I was tweeting  and like trying that  and then all of a sudden  the friend at dinner  got mad because  I didn't add her  to the tweet  like oh  I'm not important  in your life  I'm like  we're friends  so she wasn't mad  that  was it a business friend  no just a friend  and she got upset  because she said  you tweet everybody else  but you don't tweet about me  she's not mad  that you're tweeting  she's mad  that you didn't  at mention her  in your dinner tweet 
[03:21:00]  yeah  what the fuck  and you're sitting there  going look  I have to deal with this shit  every single day  of my life  I don't need  I don't need this  coming from my personal life  yeah  why  why  see like  shit like that happens  I'm like  uncle  yeah  yeah  I'm done  I'm done  I don't need dicks in the ass  at dinner  I get them all day long  and if Rob and the wizard  are listening  the plug all the things  is just a joke  it's just a joke  Rob and the wizard  those are the management  yes  well they're not luckily  but  that's true 
[03:21:30]  that's true  but assuming they were  yeah just in case  well has today  been a good day  for you  I get stuff  for this guy  it'll be a good day  it will be  you're really nervous  about the guy  from Models  what  it's a  it's a favorite thing  alright  alright  Eric do you have to deal  with anything like this  not like that  no  this seems crazy right  you have to deal  with mulch  what do you mean mulch  nothing to do with work  no Roland panics 
[03:22:00]  why did you say  you have to deal  with mulch  because I worked on  I did landscaping  over the weekend  and Roland's just obsessed  that I had to buy  bags of mulch  are you making fun of Eric  for having a lawn  no I'm just saying  it's a lot of fucking work  I guess so  but it's not like  nothing to do with  what he was just talking about  making sure that you  don't hurt mulch's feelings  so that it doesn't  cost you your career  it doesn't seem like  it's that big of a stress  on Eric's life  I know I just deflect  deflect  it doesn't work  you say things  that don't mean anything  and then we get back  to what we were talking  about a minute ago  son of a bitch 
[03:22:30]  I want to get back  to what Roland does  with all of this  there's times  where he'll get off the phone  or finish an email  and he won't even  say anything  because Roland likes to talk  and dick around  and everything  but he'll just go  he'll get up  and then he walks away  and then you don't see Roland  for half an hour  then he comes back in  and if things are going good  he walks in and goes  shut the fuck up  or he throws things  or whatever  wait wait wait  that's how you know  things are going good  he's throwing things  that's when things  are going good  when things aren't going good  Roland just kind of  walks real quickly  back into the office 
[03:23:00]  sits back down  and continues what he was doing  and doesn't really say  anything to anybody  and he's been doing that  a lot lately  he's been doing which one  the not as talkative  when he leaves the room  and then coming back  half an hour later  when other people  are looking for him  like I don't know  where he is  tough times lately for you  you know  summer brings  bags of dicks  is that an expression  in the talent booking community  summer brings bags of dicks  no it's in the bible  it is 
[03:23:30]  yeah  is that what  because it's summer movie season  yeah  well that and  yeah  it's a busy season  yeah  and so you  so it brings you  bags of dicks  yeah  because you're trying  to book guests  yeah  and they're not coming  no it's not that  it's just  a multitude of different things  I mean that's like  the least problem  like what's one of the things  in the bag of dicks  uh  if you have somebody  of authority  telling you how to do your job  and they don't know  fuck from fuck 
[03:24:00]  oh  that's  from Shinola  Roland doesn't like  when people tell him  how to do his job  I think it's shit from Shinola  not fuck from Shinola  he just said  you don't know  fuck from fuck  in Shinola  like it's shit from Shinola  who's in there laughing  at Roland so  yeah he loves it  he loves it  you don't like it  when people tell you  how to do your job  I know  well don't you think  you could do it a little better  well I could do their job  here's what I would do  Roland  if it were me  I would call the publicist  and I would  you don't want me  to say stuff like that  no 
[03:24:30]  I don't  then I don't want  in my head  I could do your job better  but you can't  their job yeah  you think you could  the person who told me this  a thousand percent  but you won't mention names  no  but it's like  because it's one of you  it's a higher up  yeah possibly  right  it's not me or Sal  is what I'm saying  no  it's not somebody  who I could just pull in here  and bust his balls  no  okay  what's up Sam  Sam  you're very eager  oh yeah  but I love  I love sitting next to Roland  it is  it is one of the most 
[03:25:00]  why  fun thing  just  just the  the gamut of emotions  that Roland  runs throughout a day  he'll come in  Roland does a thing  where he just goes  oh Jesus  I'm just like  and he'll say that  that's what he said  he'll say that line  Eric  am I right  Roland will say that line  a hundred times a day  you don't have to say  I'm just like  oh  if you're saying  oh  but I understand  but when Roland says that  I know the feeling  he's feeling at that moment  in time  you know  yeah but you could just say  oh  instead of saying  I'm just like 
[03:25:30]  oh  yeah but that's Roland's line  that's how I know  what is the line Roland  and in that moment  I know  I just give Roland  let him do his thing  he needs his space  because right now  he's just like  ah  he's just like  ah  and that's one of those moments  it's like  don't fuck with Roland  but then when he's in a good mood  you know I fuck around  then we joke around  and all that sort of shit  Roland how are you feeling right now  what are you just  I'm just like  ah  Jesus  oh yeah  yeah  that's not good  is it Sal  every time I do a saying  I probably get the saying 
[03:26:00]  wrong ten times out of ten  Satan  saying  oh  it sounded like he said  every time I do Satan  yeah  yeah yeah  saying  like what kind of saying  like um  you can lead the horse to the water  but that fella cannot drink it  why not  I don't know  why can't he drink the water  I don't know  you let him there  why couldn't he drink it  because you're a bad horse  you can lead a horse to water  but that fella cannot drink it  yeah  Joe in Illinois  the almighty Sam Roberts 
[03:26:30]  what's up buddy  hey  you know  why don't you do this  the listeners have to listen  to somebody interview  the guest  why don't you tell us  who the guest is  and let the listeners try  well  I'll be letting the cat  out of the bag  it's the guy who owns  Models  yeah  yeah  but apparently  apparently Roland tells me  he's an interesting  compelling guy  yes  he's got a lot going on  gotta go to Moe's  gotta go to Moe  because you're sitting here 
[03:27:00]  you're just trying to pitch  a guest  all of a sudden  you gotta eat all this shit  and you're just like  correct  is Models a national chain  I don't think so  I think it's  I think it's a regional  it's the east coast  yeah it's just the east coast  most of the people  wouldn't even know  what the fuck  he was talking about  but half the people  remember the management  said oh  you gotta go regional  I don't think  management has ever said that  it's a national company  Eric  they're lacking  has anyone in management  ever told you to go regional  no  no  I don't think anybody's  ever said that here 
[03:27:30]  they don't even want us  going local  no because it's a national company  we're talking to everybody  yeah it's international  well maybe somebody  in like Arkansas  will go  oh I'm gonna go to  their website now  right  I guess  because they gotta go to Moe's  I guess that's possible  because they're telling you  you gotta go to Moe's  I mean is there a  you're in a rough place  Roland  I didn't know that  Summer was bringing  so many dicks  yes  what's up Sal  it is Modell's  is it confirmed  that's Modell's 
[03:28:00]  yeah yeah  it's a guy who owns Modell's  so it's not like  it's only an east coast thing  Modell's  I think so baby  it's on the website  the weirdest thing about Modell's  is that they had that  theme song  you know that  gotta go to Moe's  yeah yeah  the one Roland was just singing  but they play it  when you're in the store  of course  they want to get it  into your head  it's so fucking  I gotta find it  I walk around this  and go  gotta go to Moe's  what are you talking about  you see most people  are sitting  gotta go to Moe's  yeah  gotta go to Moe's  you're insane  you're insane  Jeff in South Carolina 
[03:28:30]  hey Sam  I wanna do a  what did I learn today  what did you learn  I learned that Sam  is not a Dan Aykroyd  type of guy  why  cause Dan Aykroyd  pulled a favor  did that shitty ass  Teddy Shack 2  as a favor for a friend  you can't do this  for Roland  look up with him  that's true  that's true  thank you  Dan Aykroyd  a buddy  a buddy  needed Dan Aykroyd  to do  Caddyshack 2  and god damn it  Dan Aykroyd  did it for him  yeah  and go to Moe's  my friend  Will in Salt Lake

[03:30:30]  is that right Craig  Craig go back  and fuck your wife  make her satisfied  he's right though  I mean that's the only  thing I worry about  Craig's full of shit  is he  yeah his friend  just texted me  he's an asshole  Craig's friend  texted you  yeah  Craig said he's an  are you gonna add  Craig to the bag  of dicks  that's coming  for the summer  no Craig's  just like a  like a little  like annoying fly  just get away  right okay  that's well said  Justin in Indiana  son of a bitch  hey how's it going  guys  what's up 
[03:31:00]  I just wanted to say  in Roland's defense  I'm driving here  in Indiana  and I've got no  fucking clue  what Modell's is  but I went to  their website  well okay  well I guess  I guess it's  getting something  done  alright well  since we sang  the song  and that guy  from Indiana  now has been  to the website  haven't we done  the job  like aren't we  done  no you can  bring the fella  in  alright maybe  if O&A  don't take him  I will  now that we  have this whole  backstory set up  but it's gotta  be soon  I can't have  people forgetting  this radio magic 
[03:31:30]  that's been  happening this  morning  yeah and  I'll make it up  to you with a  good name  yeah good name  yeah  you know what  I'll give you  I'll give you  this other name  what name  he has a movie  coming out  he's big  is it Robert Downey Jr  because if it's  Robert Downey Jr  I'll do it  he's at that level  really  yeah  alright  so I'll give him  for you  for your Sunday show  alright  alright I'll do it  so we'll get him  here and then  I'll put time  for your Sunday show  okay  that sounds good 
[03:32:00]  Roland I think  we have a deal  what about the  Models guy  for your Sunday show  I don't think  I'm gonna do that  I don't think  I'm gonna do  Models  for the Sunday show  throw him on here  with some of the  live listeners  let everybody  have a little fun  sing the Models  song  I'll buy t-shirts  and then we'll laugh  say hey  you take them  look  we got some t-shirts  got some  Jeremy Lin  $3.99 t-shirts  are they on sale now  yeah  you feel like a fool  Roland loves all the  sports trends  so Roland  you remember Jeremy Lin 
[03:32:30]  the Asian Knicks player  he was injured  yeah Roland bought  all the Jeremy Lin  t-shirts as soon as  they came out  now  now  what do you got  a closet full of  Jeremy Lin shirts  that you're never gonna wear  well he also had  Tebow shirts  that's true  oh shit I forgot  Roland  how are you doing  with the Tebow thing  Tebow was cut  yesterday  yeah  he didn't do well  you're not  how are you doing  with it  I think he's  the same as me  he's going  ah Jesus  he's probably  saying more than that  fuck  what are you gonna do  with your Tebow shirts 
[03:33:00]  I'll still wear them  take them back to Models  you will  yeah  maybe yeah yeah  maybe when the guy  who runs Models  comes in here  ask him for a refund  yeah ask him  hey look  your teacher's  overstretched now  can I come in  money back  your teacher is  overstretched  the person who  teaches you things  t-shirt  t-shirt is overstretched  now  you're still gonna wear them  no  no I wouldn't think so  come out of the house  I was like I don't care  yeah so you have  Tebow  were you sad  that he got cut  it's bound to happen  they're gonna have  a shitty season 
[03:33:30]  this year  they are  why is that  they just have  they got rid of  everybody  well I mean  Tebow wasn't  doing anything  it's a rebuilding  year  is that what it is  yeah  that's what they  call a shitty year  Chad in Wisconsin  hey isn't Tom Modell  that Super 8 hotel guy  here at Modell's  we'll leave the light on  didn't he have a name  like that  I don't know  we'll leave the light on  for you  Ray in St. Louis  Sammy what's up  what's up Ray  hey

[03:34:30]  when are you doing  a food court  I think the 18th  of May  make that stuff happen  man  alright  and then this Friday  is Tacos Day  the guys don't know  about it yet  where  here  here  this Friday  is Taco Day  on O&A  yeah  Modell's and Taco Day  and there's surprises too  you're planning surprises  yeah  you're not supposed  to plan surprises  Roland  no  because they're  they're always  outlandish  aren't they 
[03:35:00]  two mariachis  no  yeah  don't give away  the surprises  are you really getting  why are you doing  Taco Day on Friday  Cinco de Mayo  my people  Friday's not  Cinco de Mayo  but Sunday  yes  I can't do a Monday  it makes no sense  so you're gonna celebrate  Cinco de Mayo  in here on Friday  yeah  guacamole  margaritas  tacos  mariachis  mars is gonna be  psyched  he's not  lighted  oh jeez  that's mean  he's Puerto Rican  snowy in Michigan  hey how you doing  Sam  good 
[03:35:30]  isn't the fact  that Roland's  offering you a  real good guest  in exchange  for putting Mo  on your  this Mo's guy  on your show  kind of prove  the Mo's guy  isn't really that  good of a guest  no  I think what that  says is  the guy from  Modell's  is not the  typical  guest that one  would take  maybe  doesn't make  him a bad  guest  okay  alright  I'll talk to you  later  snowy  what  I'm trying to  look at the  bible  on this bag  of dicks  and rain  I can't find  anywhere in the  bible  that says  it ain't my  bag of dicks  Romans 4  chapters 3 
[03:36:00]  through 8  okay  did you check  Romans 4  chapters 3  through 8  alright  goodbye  snowy  I'm almost  pot  Troy you were  raised religious  right  yeah  is bag  is bag  of dicks  in the bible  not to my  knowledge  I would  think you  probably  know  I think  it happened  in the  Babylon  when the  two parties  in the  Babylonians  maybe the  ancient Roman  empire  right  but that was  after  or  what were  the  the  the  hittites  the guys  that got  killed  I don't know 
[03:36:30]  what any of you  are talking  about  Frank  in Chicago  how are you  doing  how are you  alright  I just want  to explain  the landing gear  that was found  on the other  day on  Friday  right  on Friday  there was  a big story  that a  landing gear  from a plane  was found  in between  two buildings  that everybody  was saying  this is from  one of the  9-11 planes  one of the  addresses was  actually the  mosque  in 2010  that brought up  all that  controversy  right  it was  one of the  buildings  I don't know  which one  it was  located on  Murray Street  and the 
[03:37:00]  engine that  was found  on the day  of 9-11  was on  Murray Street  the landing gear  that was found  on the day  of 9-11  with the tire  on it  was a rear  landing gear  and it was  found somewhere  north of the  of the towers  and it  came from  the plane  that hit  the south  tower  flight 175  because when  you remember  and you look  at videos  you can see  the plane  was all the  way over  to the right  the landing gear  and the engines  missed the core  the reason the  landing gear  and this brings  up the debate 
[03:37:30]  about the extra  equipment underneath  175  right  and pods  what happened  was the plane  was moving  erratic  okay  it was at least  there was  three seats  two pilot seats  and a jump  seat for the  flight attendant  what are you  talking about  what do you mean  three seats  where  I'm trying to  explain the  extra equipment  and the  landing gear  all together  okay  so if there  was one  terrorist  sitting down  in the  jump seat  for whatever  reason  let's take  him out  of the  equation  so we  can fill  all three  seats  that means  there was 
[03:38:00]  two  standing  terrorists  is it  possible  that one  of the  terrorists  was thrown  forward  and hit  the landing  gear  handle  just enough  to open  the doors  but not  make the  landing gear  go down  and this  is why  the landing  gear  was able  to escape  the plane  because the  doors were  open  that is  if you look  at pictures  on the  internet  I don't know  I had to hang  up on Frank  I don't know  what he's  talking about  what is he  talking about  I guess  yeah the  plane blew  up and  then they  found the  landing gear  like a  long time  later  that's what 
[03:38:30]  happened  right  apparently  that makes  sense  the plane  blew up  in a  building  and so  obviously the  shit went  everywhere  and then  they didn't  see one  of the  landing  gears  and then  they saw  it  that's my  understanding  of the  events  I don't know  where he was  going with that  well I don't know  either  I didn't think  there was a lot  of controversy  let's go to  Anthony  Anthony  hi  I don't know  what he's talking  about  first of all  it wasn't a  landing gear  they just  found  what was it 
[03:39:00]  it was a  flap  actuator  off the  wing  it wasn't  a  it wasn't a  landing gear  that makes  more sense  it was one  of the little  hinge motor  things that  make the  flaps open  and close  from the  wing  so  come on  fucking  cock  what happened  taxi  fuck dick  oh of course  of course  he's that  person  yeah  so it wasn't  even a  landing gear  what's the  guy thinking  and what is he  how did the  guy fall on  the landing gear 
[03:39:30]  the terrorists  fell on the  landing gear  handle  that's why  I had to  hang up  on him  because he's  going  isn't it  possible  that one  of the  standing  terrorists  opened up  the door  I don't  know  yeah  what  maybe  I don't  know  I just  didn't want  misinformation  out there  on the  Sam Roberts  after show  so it's  it was from  the wing  it wasn't  a landing gear  it was  yeah  it's a wing  flap  and guess  what  the wings  were sticking  out of the  plane  apparently  that's how  they fly  yeah  crazy  christ almighty  have a fun 
[03:40:00]  rest of the  show  drive safely  I'll be  napping before  you're even  done  I know  jealous  bye  bye  I don't know  people love  these conspiracy  theories though  and you can  always hear it  because you  get so wrapped  up in them  that when  somebody explains  it  like with  that guy  obviously that  guy had this  whole thing  that he worked  out in his  head  either right  before  like it was  when those  bizarre ideas  come it was  either right  before he fell  asleep or  while he was  in the shower  and like this 
[03:40:30]  aha moment  comes because  those are when  these ideas  come to you  that you later  realize are bad  ideas like  90% of the  ideas that come  to you when  you're in the  shower or right  before you fall  asleep are  horrible ideas  but when they  come to you  at that moment  it's the greatest  idea you've ever  had in your  life  so this guy  in that moment  obviously Frank  or whatever his  name was  he calls up  and he's got  this whole thing  that he's gonna  spill out  and in his  mind we're all  gonna go  whoa  you figured it 
[03:41:00]  all out  you unlocked  the mystery  see the problem  is Sam  you've never  smoked weed  is that what  it is  a lot of times  what it is  is you get  really high  and you're with  your buddies  and you solve  all the fucking  world's problems  and then somebody  like Ant comes  along and goes  that wasn't  landing gear  Ant who's not  high  who's thinking  logically  what we call  truth telling  buzz kill  yeah  and it's like  oh fuck  but if you're  hanging  that dude's  probably stoned 
[03:41:30]  or is a stoner  him and his  buddies  and they fucking  solve all the  goddamn problems  and then somebody  comes and he's  got it  he's figured it  out  and he can't  wait to tell  you it  and then I hang  up on him  because he's  long winded  and he's like  what  how the fuck  that wasn't  supposed to  happen like  that  right  and the next  call is Ant  saying  you didn't even  get the part  right  that wasn't  it was a  thing from  the wing  obviously  it just  blew off  the wing  obviously  there's a lot  of confusion  about 9-11  and such  things  yeah  do you think 
[03:42:00]  9-11 was  an inside job  I don't know  if it  you know  it's like  one of those  things where  you know  you've been  told so many  different things  and I  think that  we may have  looked past  some things  to let it  happen  that's my  belief on it  and I know  a lot of people  get angry at me  thinking that way  yeah  but a lot  you know  a lot of times  people  just hear what  they want to hear  on both sides  whether it be  conspiracies  or whether it be  this is what the 
[03:42:30]  media is telling me  this is what it is  you know  instead of  kind of  you know  and everybody  goofs on me  for asking  questions  asking questions  but there's a lot  of questions  that are like  that doesn't  make sense  but I just  don't know  if the government  would have  looked past  a plane  flying into  their own  building  it wasn't  just civilians  they flew a  plane into  the pentagon  but again  there's certain  things that  I always  question that  are just  like  that really  don't make  sense  like what  well I mean  like why  why is there  no video  of the plane  crashing into  the pentagon  why won't  they release  that video  there's the 
[03:43:00]  choppy video  you know  you've seen  the security  there was  security  cameras  all over  the place  that  that  from  angle  different  angles  and they  confiscated  all the  all the  security  tape  because  it's the  pentagon  but why  won't they  show it  because  you can't  it's the  pentagon  why can't  why can  you not  it's a  security  issue  I mean  everything  that's  secure  you can't  just make  everything  public  first of all  and there  was nobody  there with  cameras  that captured  it  I mean  look how many  people saw  the  there were  at least  one  captured 
[03:43:30]  the first  plane  you're in  New York  the biggest  the most  populated city  in the world  but that's  just one  you're in  New York  one person  got that  plane  okay  it's the  pentagon  no nobody  had their  phone out  pointing at  the pentagon  okay but  okay they  show that  one video  but why  do they  not show  the plane  they only  show the  explosion  because  that's  what that  video was  okay so  why don't  they show  you another  one  if that's  really  what  happened  if that's  really  what  happened  why would  they just  show you  another  and be like 
[03:44:00]  look  was it  before the  iPhone  so  yeah  Troy's  talking about  the fact  that they  have outdoor  cameras that  would show  I mean I think  it is going  into the outside  of the building  not the inside  right  it's the same  reason that  on 9-11  they didn't  they barely  showed the  pentagon  all the  all the cameras  were on the  world trade  center  because you  can't  take  you know  what's the  one of the  government  headquarters  the military  headquarters  you don't  know what  kind of  classified  information is  just floating  in midair 
[03:44:30]  you can't  show the  inside of  that building  no I'm not  talking about  the building  I'm talking  about all  the surrounding  buildings around  there's all  security cameras  all around  there  that's what  I mean  why can't  you show  the plane  physically  going into  what are  you showing  me that I'm  not allowed  to see  by showing  that  you just  they want  they want  to keep  everything  all I'm  saying  it's just  it's just  one of  those  questions  that  people  just  glaze  over  they don't  want to  ask it  but it's  harder  to answer  it's an  easier question  to say  to disregard  to say  well they  don't have  footage of  the pentagon  being a  plane flying 
[03:45:00]  into the  pentagon  that they  will show  okay that's  an easier  question to  disregard  than  why would  they blow  a hole  into the  pentagon  I mean  you'd have  to figure  out why  that  why would  they blow  to disregard  why would  they blow  a hole  into the  pentagon  it's a  much bigger  question  to disregard  than any  of these  other questions  I can give  you speculation  what is it  I mean  to show  that we're  being attacked  at another  place  but they already  had the  world trade  center  but if you  show it  from multiple  locations 
[03:45:30]  it looks like  a bigger  attack  but if they  wanted to  make that  much of an  impact  why wouldn't  they show  it  show the  plane  going in  yeah  because maybe  it wasn't  a plane  why wouldn't  they have  flown a plane  into it  they flew  a plane  into the  other  buildings  there's a lot  of questions  to be asked  that people  don't want to  ask  there's a lot  more holes  exactly  in this theory  than there are  in the actual  story  what I'm saying  is there are  people that  the media  will give you  this story  and you just  take that story  and you go  this is what  it is  and then you  don't go  wait  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  you told us 
[03:46:00]  this but  what about  this  this doesn't  make any  sense  we don't  want to  ask those  questions  no you can  ask them  but then once  it's like  well no  this doesn't  make sense  you can't  nobody says  okay  you have to  get an answer  of how that  possibly makes  any sense  and that's  different what  you're saying  it's not that  nobody's asking  these questions  it's just you're  not getting the  answers to  these questions  exactly  it's the same  thing  but why don't  people demand  answers  they do  who  I'm sure  people do  people aren't  getting the  answers that  they want  that information  but why is  that information  not out there  because it's 
[03:46:30]  for the same  reason  all information  is classified  there's a lot  of questions  where it's just  like okay  look  terrorist got us  fine  but there's  still a lot  of things  that don't  they don't  all add up  it's a little  little strange  of course it's  strange because  it's never  happened before  right  and not  everything is  just going  to be  declassified  because conspiracy  theorists need  to sleep better  at night  well you  they  you know  you put it  out there  as the media  this is what  it says  and this is  what people  believe  so that's  what it is  and there's  a difference  between just  saying okay  well the media  tells me I 
[03:47:00]  guess it's true  and what  logically makes  sense here  right  logically what  happened here  and 9-11  logically  it doesn't  make sense  that it was  an inside  job  no it  but it  makes no  sense  it's very  well we  could have  known it  happened  it was going  to happen  but it did  no benefit  to us  well I  mean we  thought we  were going  to look  it was of  no benefit  what do you  mean  what benefit  did it serve  the country  I mean look  look where  we went  look we  started  we started 
[03:47:30]  wars after  this  so you're  saying  they orchestrated  9-11  but couldn't  find some  weapons of  mass destruction  to bury  somewhere in  Iraq  well I don't  know if they  orchestrated  they may have  looked past  things  speaking mass  destructions  how are you  doing Nicole  you know I  really didn't  come in  I just came in  to have some  good vibes  to get some  love  but maybe this  was not the  place to come  who's on the  hotline  it's oh it  says Anthony  on the screen  you can't see  oh no I  can't see it  sorry I didn't  see your name 
[03:48:00]  hey Ann I'm  touching your  mic  why do you  make me do  this  why do you  drive me crazy  that I gotta  call in  after I've  done a whole  show  oh my god  he's starting  talking to shit  Troy is a mad  person  here's why  these questions  that you ask  aren't being  answered  here's why  it falls in the  same category  as well  you know  Martians came  down and  blew up the  trade center  and the  pentagon  well so you're  saying Martians  did  yeah Martians  did 
[03:48:30]  I'm just  saying  why don't we  answer those  questions  that maybe  Martians  came down  you know  why  because it's  ludicrous  it's a  ridiculous  situation  and scenario  that couldn't  happen  wouldn't happen  so it doesn't  need an answer  so you're  saying  it wasn't  a missile  it was a  plane  the reason  there's only  that one  choppy video  that's the  only camera  that was  pointed in  that direction  no that's  absolutely not  true  there's no  other fucking  cameras that  caught the  plane  yes there was  and then there's  American Airlines 
[03:49:00]  plane debris  all over the  fucking lawn  there's pieces  there's an  engine  there's everything  no remember  they didn't  they didn't  find an  engine  they found  pieces  no they  didn't  and we've  looked this  up on the  show  anthony  we've looked  this up  on the  show  anthony  anthony  there's a  turbine  we've looked  this up  on the  we've gone  down this  road on  the show  before  remember  we tried  to look  it up  we found  pieces of  debris  but there  was no  huge  engines  anthony  we've gone  down this  road  before  look up 
[03:49:30]  fucking  pentagon  engine  you'll find  an engine  why did  they shoot  a missile  into the  pentagon  I don't  know  but I'm  just saying  why isn't  the video  out  that question  because  anth's  response  of  because  that was  the only  video  that's  available  makes a  lot more  sense  than saying  they shot  a missile  in  I don't  know  why  no there  was  other  video  captured  from  other  buildings  of a 
[03:50:00]  missile  being  shot  in  do you  think  no  they confiscated  all of  the  video  because  they shot  a missile  confiscate  all the  video  and  they're  not  releasing  it  there's  other  video  got out  of a  missile  hitting  the  pentagon  after all  the lies  they told  that it  was a  plane  do you  understand  that the  risk  for shooting  a missile  into the  pentagon  again  if they  had this  whole  thing  planned  out  why  didn't  they  just  fly  the  plane  into  the  pentagon  like  the  trade  center  why  would  they  choose  a  missile  it's  the  dumbest 
[03:50:30]  thing  in the  world  I  wasn't  there  I  don't  know  if  you  don't  have  an  answer  to  it  at  this  point  years  later  then it's  just a  ridiculous  there is  no answer  so you  mean to  tell me  everything  with 9-11  Anthony  you believe  everything  you've been  told and  everything  makes perfect  sense  and there's  nothing  to be  questioning  there's  nothing  that's  a little  weird  that's  a little  odd  and that  it's  been  investigated  by  reputable  sources  that tell  me  that 
[03:51:00]  planes  flew into  all these  buildings  from terrorists  that planned  for years  to do this  and actually  carried it  out  was there  a lapse  in intel  sure there  was  was it  a purposeful  thing  on the part  of the  United States  government  I honestly  don't think  so  I think  it's  what it  was  terrorists  figured out  that planes  would be a  great weapon  and flew them  into these  buildings  and it  worked  perfectly  for them  actually  you know  three out  of four  it  worked  for them  great  and how  did you  know  that's  from the  pentagon 
[03:51:30]  I googled  and there  is a  pentagon  engine  there's a  google image  of what  looks to be  a piece  of an  airplane  engine  in the  pentagon  debris  it's just  debris  it's just  a pile of  debris  google the  pentagon  google the  pentagon  alright  Troy  here's a  better  question  than the  engine  fuck  the  engine  let's  say  for the  sake  of  argument  there  is  no  engine  you're  right  where did  the plane  and the  fucking  people go  that took 
[03:52:00]  off from  an airport  with a  fucking  bunch of  people on  it  where do  they go  that's a  great  question  yet  another  question  that needs  to be  answered  oh  come on  here's the  answer  I don't  have all  the answers  buddy  you know  what the  good answer  is  you know  what the  real answer  is  they're  dead  because  their plane  crashed  into a  building  to try  to discount  all of the  absolutely  logical  things that  happen  with one  insane 
[03:52:30]  notion  makes no  sense  to it  it's just  there's  plenty  other  questions  stop  saying  questions  don't you  think  logically  it makes  more sense  that we're  missing some  videotape  than it does  that we're  missing an  airplane  and 50  people  and  there's a  hole in the  pentagon  I love  that  you're  showing me  a diagram  drawn by  an artist  did the  missile  have to  have  American  Airlines  plane  debris  in it  that's  sprinkled  all over  the place 
[03:53:00]  I don't  know  I mean  the debris  that was  Anthony  we've gone  through this  on the show  before  we've brought  up all the  pictures  on air  we've done  this  there's tiny  pieces of  aluminum  scattered around  the front  there's nothing  big  with American  Airlines  plane  logo  and windows  on it  where'd that  come from  where  find that  picture  what were you  looking at  I don't know  Roland is  showing me  pictures drawn  by an artist 
[03:53:30]  and being like  see  look  I think he's  showing you  the physics  of how it  could go in  but  absolutely  is  American  Airlines  aircraft  debris  on the  grass  and in  the actual  crash site  and before  I believe  that we  shot a  missile  into our  own  pentagon  I have  got to  know why  we would  do it  and it's  been 11  years  and there's  we've had  no benefit  of the whole  being in the  pentagon  look  Roland's  the worst  person to be  trying to 
[03:54:00]  argue this  point with  because he's  showing me  a close up  of a  fucking  airplane  it says  see  for a part  of American  Airlines  dummy  okay  yeah but  how do I  know that's  in front  of the  pentagon  dummy  there  oh god  it's from  the pentagon  I can't  believe  it's  2013  and this  is still  being  fucking  discussed  oh my  god  yeah  you know  what  you know  what I  just flew  into  my driveway  take it  easy guys 
[03:54:30]  enjoy your  nap  I'm napping  bye  bye  what did  you walk  into  Nicole  I don't  even know  what's  going  I mean  you're  asking  the wrong  girl  I don't  know  about  any  of this  shit  Troy  thinks  that  on  9-11  the government  might have  I said  might  the government  might have  shot a missile  into the pentagon  possible  why  you're  you're  you're  this is  Nicole versus  the streets  I don't know  anything about  anything about  anything  you're there  to play the hits  I'm here  to play the  fucking hits  and maybe  tell a good 
[03:55:00]  story about  blowing a guy  or something  maybe tell you  some good  partying and  sexual stories  that's all  I'm really good  for for you  for me  for you  for this  for these  purposes  right  otherwise  don't ask me  I don't know  shit about  9-11  I don't know  shit about  any of that  shit  Stan do you  think that  the government  flew a missile  into the pentagon  I didn't hear  the question  I just saw  Troy's  T-Roy's  Tats  and they  always  mesmerize  me  right  memorize you  do you  think  on 9-11  the government  our United 
[03:55:30]  States government  might  have shot  a missile  into our  own pentagon  no  okay  well  Troy  thinks  it  might  have  happened  Troy  thinks  that's  a possibility  I just  said  that they  won't  release  any other  videos  of the  plane  crashing into  the pentagon  don't  some people  think  Bush  knew  don't  some people  think  Bush  knew  about  the  9-11  planes  that he  was responsible  for the 
[03:56:00]  planes  going into  the towers  I think  most of  the people  who think  Bush  was responsible  for 9-11  could probably  have a pretty  good intellectual  back and forth  with like  you  you know  that's where  I do think  that they  might have  possibly  shot down  a plane  that makes  sense  though  I do  believe  that  that I  would  understand  because  at least  the  conspiracy  there  makes  there's  some  logic  to it  because  they  didn't  want  it  to  fly  anywhere  so they  shot  it 
[03:56:30]  if  you  look  like  you're  getting  attacked  from  different  angles  it's  like  oh  shit  New York  got  attacked  oh  shit  DC  got  attacked  oh  shit  it's  fucking  on  we gotta  fucking  go to war  now  if this  was all to  orchestrate  a war 
[03:57:00]  and then  the war  was  orchestrated  couldn't they  have done  a little  better job  of orchestrating  the war  who knows  you see  Stan we get  to a place  and he  revs it up  and we get  to a place  and then a  question gets  asked and  Troy goes  I don't know  man  there's  questions  and I  said  other  camera angles  of something  crashing into  the pentagon  that's how  this got  started  what are  the questions  look  I don't  give a fuck  about this  I really  don't  you seem  very passionate 
[03:57:30]  because you  guys come  at me  and it  just gets  my blood  pumping  and I'm  ready to  fucking  bounce  but  all I'm  saying is  there's a lot  of things  where you  just go  I don't  know why  people don't  ask that  question  it kind  of boggles  my mind  it kind  of boggles  my mind  that people  think  that the  fucking  guy's  passport  could make  it through  that explosion  I think  it's because  the alternative  which is  somebody shot  we shot a  missile into  the pentagon  just because  it's so  ludicrous  that they're 
[03:58:00]  like okay  well I guess  that must be  all the video  footage  there it is  there's your  answer  because the  missile thing  just doesn't  add up  at all  at all  I'm not  saying  but why  won't they  show the  video  the plane  the plane  not a missile  the plane boss  John in  Albany  hey Sam  I just  wanted to  remind you  that you're  arguing 9-11  with a  molly popping  DJ  are you a  molly popping  DJ  no I haven't
