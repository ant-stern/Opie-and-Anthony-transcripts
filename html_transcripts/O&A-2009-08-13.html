<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts, referring to themselves as "Poon and Peener," launching into a tirade about their frustrations with management and personnel changes throughout their careers. They express their disdain for the pressure to always be "nice" on the radio, citing specific examples of colleagues like Ron Valeri and Tom Chiasano who, after initially supporting them, left for other opportunities. This fuels a bitter discussion about their perceived bad luck and lack of consistent managerial support compared to other successful radio shows, punctuated by frequent expletives and expressions of anger.

This segues into a discussion about Anthony's exorbitant electricity bill – over $2600 for July (later clarified to be for June and July combined). This sparks a humorous guessing game among the hosts and callers, eventually attributing the high cost to Anthony's excessively heated pool (maintained at around 90 degrees).  The conversation veers into tangents about the cost of luxury, the vast difference between Anthony's energy consumption and that of average listeners, and Anthony's description of his pool as feeling like "sitting in piss."  The hosts and callers debate the effectiveness and aesthetics of alternative energy sources like solar panels (with Jimmy demonstrating a humorous misunderstanding of their function) and wind turbines, touching upon the visual impact of wind turbines and cell towers disguised as trees and cacti.  The discussion also includes listener calls sharing their own electricity bill experiences and perspectives on renewable energy, concluding with further discussion about the challenges of energy storage and the tension between economic development and environmental concerns.  The segment also includes mention of a newspaper's perceived bias and an update on a story about Dominic Barbera, although specifics are not provided.  A caller, Psycho Bob, offers a humorous, cynical perspective on the hosts’ situations.

The show continues with a discussion about the health concerns of parishioners regarding cell towers, contrasted with the hosts' assertion that household appliances emit more RF energy.  Anthony again highlights his $2600 electricity bill for June and July.  A caller, Lee, calculates Anthony’s energy consumption, leading to speculation about the power usage of major league stadiums, briefly mentioning the New York Mets and Yankees.  This is followed by a host's rant about their disgust with media coverage of a specific story, focusing on a wrong-way driver case and the lawyer, Dominic Barbera, whose defense is described as unbelievable and dishonorable.  A promotional announcement for an upcoming live show and another host's Wildwood appearance are made.  Finally, the segment ends with humorous banter about one host's upcoming appearance on Sean Hannity's show and the potential (and subsequent disappointment) of being removed from the lineup, concluding with the hosts again referring to themselves as "Poon and Peener."

[00:00:00]  I 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opi and Anthony.  I dropped Nessie in the toilet. 
[00:04:00]  That's a dark chocolate pretzel.  There's the end of it after I drop more on top of it.  I did such a bowl clogger yesterday.  I didn't even look at that at all.  She had big boobs, didn't she?  She does.  Would you have a lick of boobs if you could?  Yeah.  I could.  You know what is so goddamn good?  What?  When you said, you know what's so goddamn good, I just wanted to scream, come. 
[00:04:30]  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history, satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, let's.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Also known as Poon and Peener.  Poon and Peener with you.  Hi.  Did we play the butcher thing?  We did one time, right?  Let me give Butcher a little bone today.  Give him one more play. 
[00:05:00]  The Poon and Peener Sweeper.  Poon and Peener in the morning.  Oh, shit.  That shit is off the hook, yo.  Poon and Peener.  Cut, fuck, dick radio.  Beware, this is radio like you've never heard before.  You just know you're not going to hear anything thought-provoking or interesting.  Poon and Peener show.  Chuck Chuck's Poon and Peener in trouble today.  This time it was Poon.  Poon and Peener.  Fuck you and fuck them.  Poon and Peener.  Weekday morning, 6 to 10 a.m.  I think we should develop the Poon and Peener thing. 
[00:05:30]  That's our ultra-egos.  Poon and Peener.  Well, you still like Rape Crit?  Rape Crit.  Holy cow.  Rape Kid and Crawl Space.  Yes.  They rule.  That's the number one shock jock show in America.  It's my favorite.  Jack Jax.  How about we just go home and start our vacation?  I'd love that.  What would happen?  I'm in vacation mode.  All we would have to do is cancel some guests and then we start our vacation early. 
[00:06:00]  What are they going to do down the hall?  Yell and scream a little bit.  Yeah, they'll get mad, but they'll just yell, bitch a little bit.  And then we go on vacation.  And then that's what we do now.  So we don't got to see him for a couple of weeks.  And by the time we get back, everything's forgotten.  We don't see him now.  Exactly.  We figured that one out nice.  Exactly.  I ran into one of the guys in the bathroom.  He's like, oh, we got to catch up.  Get coffee or something.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. 
[00:06:30]  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  I go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and then he went his way, I went mine, and I don't know, that was at least a week  ago.  No coffee.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  It's amazing.  It really is.  What's amazing?  Just the whole.  The whole thing?  Yeah.  What?  I really want to change my name legally to piece of shit.  I don't get it.  Morning, piece of shit.  Hello.  That'd fit the bill, wouldn't it?  I just don't get it.  We've had the worst luck in our careers. 
[00:07:00]  We've done very well for ourselves, but we've also had the worst luck.  People we do have on our side end up leaving all the time.  Yeah.  Leaving us to other parents.  What email was here yesterday, you know that?  Oh, no, he doesn't.  I was shocked to see it.  He don't care about us anymore.  What?  No, he was in a meeting with, I think he was doing Oprah stuff.  The old days he would stop by, say hi, or at least email and say he's coming to town.  He looked good, man.  He looked really healthy.  I was happy to see him, you know.  Oh, what a fuck.  What a fuck.  Fuck him.  He looks good.  He's fucking in his suit. 
[00:07:30]  I was enjoying it.  Wheeling and dealing for Oprah.  Fuck Elo.  Fuck him, the abandoning us motherfucker.  He really did just leave him.  Oh, he ditched us like a fucking deadbeat dad.  That's what Elo is.  A deadbeat dad.  He looked all healthy.  How many goodbyes have we had?  Prick.  When Ant and I started together, it was this guy, Ron Valeri, believed in us.  He brought us to Boston.  He was excited to have us.  And literally the second day there, he's like, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. 
[00:08:00]  I'm like, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  We just changed our whole lives to come up here.  We believed in your pitch.  We're here.  We're your guys.  He goes, that's nice.  But I got a gig at Q104 in New York City.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  And he's packing his bags.  And it's been that way ever since.  People just leaving us.  I don't mind new people.  But after a while, when certain things are happening, it starts to get to a point where  you just get so disgusted with, you know.  Well, that's why we go this way after our show. 
[00:08:30]  You know, we hold our end of the bargain up.  Yeah.  That's what we do now.  We do, though.  We come in here and work our balls off and we entertain the people and then we sneak out.  We're good boys.  And someday maybe they'll hold their end of the bargain up for us.  Just in general, I'm an honest guy and I do business honestly.  And I just don't respect anybody who doesn't.  I just don't respect anybody who doesn't.  Mm-hmm.  But that's the way it's been for so long.  I don't know any other way, to tell you the truth. 
[00:09:00]  Mm-hmm.  I only know, you know, having fun doing the show and everything, but just behind the scenes,  management-wise, things like that, just getting the big old cock right in the ass.  Mm-hmm.  So I wouldn't know.  I'm like one of those beaten junkyard dogs.  That's what I feel like.  Other high-profile radio shows, they've always had the guy looking out for them.  And they kind of have that guy for their whole career.  Not us.  No.  When we get used to one guy, he's out, moving on to the next opportunity. 
[00:09:30]  And we're left with guys that don't get the show, don't want the show, don't appreciate the show.  Yeah.  Boy, are we ready for vacation, huh?  No.  It happened with Ron Valeri.  It happened.  And then Tom Chiasano takes us under his wing.  Oh, my God.  And look what happened there.  And the guy was in radio forever.  Let me just put it this way.  Tom Chiasano was in radio for his entire life. 
[00:10:00]  And we were enemies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A year ago.  We worked it out, and Tom was definitely our guy.  He was definitely our guy.  He appreciated the show.  He understood the show.  Understood it.  He knew how to make money off the show.  And we're like, you know what, Ed?  This is going to be all right after all.  Yeah.  What?  But after 30-some-odd years at one station.  Yeah, at one station.  They give him the old boot during our time.  During the time we're there, they gave him the boot. 
[00:10:30]  What a stroke of luck.  But then at that point, we're like, well, at least we got XM.  We got ELO.  We got these guys that, once again, understand us, understand the show,  appreciate the show, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It could always be better, but at least we felt we had our guys around us.  Oh, they all did.  This is great.  Well, you know, Tom's gone, but hey, the CBS thing, whatever.  At least we got ELO.  ELO's what?  ELO, what?  He's what?  At least ELO will be here. 
[00:11:00]  ELO, where are you going?  What's the suitcase?  But fuck him for not coming by and saying hi.  And fuck him for not sending a text or an email.  Nothing.  I'm glad you're feeling good and working out all the time  and training for a marathon.  I read his tweets.  That's how I have to keep in touch with my old friend.  You follow him?  There's a lot of people that don't follow, but I check out their Twitters.  Oh, I wouldn't check out his.  I'd check it out.  Fuck him.  I'm teasing, of course. 
[00:11:30]  Who do you follow?  Do you follow like celebrities?  No, not really.  Like guys on the show, like Rogan, Kevin Smith.  Yeah.  That's my two celebrities, I think.  What's that?  Oh, no.  I also, Chris Cornell.  Oh, okay.  When he was in.  If the guy does the show, then I start following him.  Oh.  And then.  We do the show.  You don't follow us.  I check your Twitters every day.  I haven't tweeted the week.  I haven't Twittered as much as I used to know.  I will officially start following you. 
[00:12:00]  No, you're not.  There's controversy about that.  But I actually, I check your Twitters every day.  And Duff McKagan, I follow.  Is he good?  I follow the guy.  No, I'll tell you what it is.  I follow people that I know I'm going to forget to check their Twitters.  How are his?  That makes sense.  Yeah, yeah.  It's cool, because he's traveling the world.  And I'm into the band thing.  And all of a sudden, he's got pictures of, I don't know, he's playing in Paris or something.  To me, that's kind of cool.  Traveling the world.  Yeah.  But that's it as far as celebrities, really.  Yeah.  I haven't Twittered in a while.  Oh, the dude from Red Eye. 
[00:12:30]  I follow Andy Levy, too, man.  Because he's hilarious.  I want to follow Gutfeld.  I'm sure he's pretty funny.  I don't follow Gutfeld, though.  I'm sure he's funny.  But I follow Andy Levy, because he's really, he knows how to tweet, my friend.  Yeah, he's a smartass.  It's funny.  Yeah, he's really good.  Very sarcastic.  Really good.  Yeah, I haven't tweeted in quite a while.  I was going to tweet last night.  Tweety, tweety, tweety, tweet.  Most of my tweets are now, you know, going to be doing well.  Guns and violence.  No, no, not even.  Well, for videos and things like that, and pictures. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, you tweet when you're doing live from the compound.  Yeah.  The only text tweets I do is plugging my project.  And then everything else is pictures or videos or something like that.  But last night I was going to tweet because I, but I didn't.  I figured I'd save it for the show.  I got my latest electric bill.  When I saw the old electric bill in the mailbox, I was like, all right, here it is. 
[00:13:30]  The latest electric bill, middle of the summer.  Now, as you remember, the last electric bill I got.  Holy shit.  For the month of June.  Right.  Um, was, uh, $1,300.  Just say $1,300.  $1,300.  You're right, Anthony.  $1,000.  I hate when people do that.  No offense.  Yeah, $1,300.  It's just easier to decipher. 
[00:14:00]  $1,300 bill.  Here you go, you fucker.  $1,300?  The last bill was $1,300.  And that was for the month of June?  And that was for June.  Now, all right, before you get into this, would August be more than July?  Because you're about to give us the July electric bill.  July electric bill.  Will August be the big one for the whole year, you think?  I will assume August will break all records.  Okay.  But, July has, we have a new record. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, so it's over $1,300.  It's over $1,300.  By how much?  Huh?  By how much?  I'll guess.  Well.  Can I guess?  Everybody can take a guess.  I think you blew by it.  I'm not going to say $2,000.  That's crazy.  But I'm going to go $1,000.  $1,000.  I'm going to go with an even $1,700.  $1,700.  I guess. 
[00:15:00]  $41,000.  Wow.  $736.  And he would know because he owns Ted's power plant.  I certainly do.  Danny actually wrote it down.  He's keeping tabs.  Yes.  I put light bulbs in the pools to heat them.  They burn out immediately.  Light bulbs in the pool.  Danny.  I have to drain the pool.  Unscrew them and screw them to listen. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, shit.  How much?  I can't believe Danny actually wrote his guess.  You got the name wrong.  41.  Jim Wooden makes such a stupid guess.  Yeah, that's Ted.  Jim guesses 1701.  Oh, you fuck.  1701.  Of course you do.  Why don't you be $1,700 on the nose?  If you're going to.  Well, we got $1,800 here on the thing.  $1,500.  I don't think it hit $2,000.  I guess $1,520.  $1,520.  The total of my July electric bill for the compound was $2,600. 
[00:16:00]  $2,600 of electricity.  I was closer with $41,000.  Are you serious?  I couldn't be more serious.  When I opened that fucker up, I couldn't believe what I saw.  $2,600 in electricity. 
[00:16:30]  You're leaving a fucking footprint the size of a fucking meteor.  Oh, it's fantastic.  I almost passed out.  Are you kidding me?  I opened it and went, I cannot even believe I'm using that much electricity at this place.  That's a factory.  No, really.  You can relate to the common man at this point.  I can as far as the common man that has a lot of lights on.  Nick C. from Pittsburgh.  Nick C. from Pittsburgh writes, $2,000 is crazy.  $1,300 is insane.  My electric bill this month was $78 for my house. 
[00:17:00]  $78.  $2,600.  $2,600 and change.  Someone wants to know if it's electric and gas.  No, that is pure electricity.  Holy shit.  That is just voltage and amperage coming into my household.  That is not gas, which is separate.  The propane.  The propane.  How do you say S-H-O-Y-N-E? 
[00:17:30]  Is it Sean?  They just spell it weird.  S-H-O-Y-N-E.  He gets some feedbacks all the time.  Now, I hope I get his name right.  Sean in North Carolina.  I think Ant has misunderstood the term going green.  Yes, going green.  It means shell out a lot of green.  I'm being asked, is the pool heater propane or electric?  Both.  Both.  The electric heater heats the pool for the most part.  The propane then kicks in if I need the jacuzzi up real hot real quick.  Then I go to propane.  But let me tell you something. 
[00:18:00]  That pool heater is a motherfucker as far as electricity goes.  Because you have to have your pool above 90 degrees in the summer.  I really don't get that one.  You know what?  No one gets it until they step down into that pool.  No one gets it.  I understand the luxury, having some nice luxuries in your life.  But that sounds just completely insane.  No, it is magnificent.  How does the pool feel at 90-something degrees?  I haven't been fortunate.  Let's say I average probably 90.  I haven't been fortunate enough to put my little tootsies in your pool ever, by the way. 
[00:18:30]  I average 90, by the way.  Not all of it this week.  I'm inviting myself.  Come on.  Not once, have I.  Every day.  Come on over.  It's like sitting in piss.  Bring it over.  No, it's not.  Everyone says that.  I'm saying that in a good way.  I average between.  Another vague invite.  I love the vague invite.  Come on over.  But I'll say this.  When I've taken Ant up on his vague invites, he's very, he's always happy.  He's not, he doesn't, you don't feel awkward going there.  No.  Even when you walk in and he's by himself in a mansion with a fucking, a gun and a fucking  ammo hat on.  It's comfortable for some reason. 
[00:19:00]  He's dressed like something out of the good, the bad, the ugly.  He's got the fucking bullets around his chest.  It's like, hello, creep.  One of my surprise.  Come on with boots and a bandolier.  It's funny.  It's like, what are you doing?  One of my surprise.  Why don't you just relax?  One of my surprise visits to Anthony's house, I was lucky enough to go to the drugstore  and watch him pick out toothbrushes and toothpaste and mouthwash.  Yeah, we took a little drive to CBS.  Very exciting.  I was really glad I stopped by that day.  I had to replace things.  I don't get the day when he's having a teen bikini party.  I get the day when he has to get stuff. 
[00:19:30]  You're buying the toothbrushes for them, you see like little cats with a ghost on the  end of it and little fucking blues clues.  You think Joseph's baby aspirin if they have little headaches.  I get the day where you make sure he doesn't have bad breath.  Great.  But you don't feel awkward going over there.  I didn't feel like, the times I was like, hey man, I'm going to come over and he ordered  food.  It was completely not awkward.  It was comfortable.  I was like, all right, he's just my friend.  It's like he's just not a good inviter.  No, I'm a terrible inviter.  But you didn't feel like he was being a phony inviter. 
[00:20:00]  Honestly, he's a bad inviter, but he's a very good host.  Yes.  He's a phenomenal kisser.  I will certainly say that.  Oh, well, thank you.  And Griswold, they're calling you.  Christmas Vacation.  Yes.  You know, if you did the whole Christmas Vacation with the lights thing, that would cost you  probably less than $2,600.  Oh, it would.  I do a lot of Christmas lights.  I'm saying Christmas Vacation where it's just over the top.  You know what it is?  Like I was saying, I average probably 90 degrees, the pool water, because sometimes  it gets up to 93, and then sometimes it creeps down to like 88, but I average about 90. 
[00:20:30]  That's why you should keep your pool open until at least November or December.  But no, because that's crazy, because now to try to heat it in that kind of weather is  very hard for what they call a heat pump, which is what I use to heat my pool.  And you can't draw that kind of heat out of cold air like that, so it would be crazy  to keep it open.  $2,600.  $2,600.  The pool heater.  What's your average bill?  That's your high.  What's your low?  What's your lowest month?  My low is probably something like 280, just short of three bills. 
[00:21:00]  So what are you paying on the average, would you guess?  See, I don't know this stuff either.  I don't know.  This is the first year I've had a pool, electric pool heater.  Dude.  That is the thing that's sucking it dry.  I don't even know what my electric bill was last month.  I don't either.  It might be big.  It might be $2,600.  I'm wearing my Woodstock shirt today.  Man.  The 40th anniversary.  I'm that type of guy.  Man.  I don't pay attention to that stuff.  Man.  I'm keeping people working at the electric company. 
[00:21:30]  Wow, dude.  See?  I'm making jobs.  Holy shit.  Obama wants to shut you down.  That water is fantastic.  I got to tell you something.  A lot of people go, hey, you know, why are you crazy?  Once you get in, you're just like, there's no, it's not hot.  You don't feel hot.  What you do is it's neutral.  You feel like you're walking into just a neutral temperature liquid.  And then when you get out or you're sticking out above or you lay on one of the mats and  float around, the little breeze that hits you. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, it's so nice and cool and everything.  You don't get out and shiver.  Yeah.  That way.  You get out and it's comfortable.  But on a hot summer day, I mean, we're going to be in the 90s this weekend.  I like jumping in a colder pool.  You are completely refreshed.  What's the average pool temperature for real?  Why don't you look that up?  I want to see how much higher Anthony is than the average pool.  Between 75 and 80 degrees is the normal, like, regular person's pool temperature.  And there's something about that.  When it's fucking hot as balls and you jump in a pool. 
[00:22:30]  It stinks.  It sucks for the first couple seconds.  Then you feel really refreshed.  I hate it.  I don't like where my balls fucking curl up into my intestines.  And you can't get past the nipple point.  And then you finally get past the nipple point.  Now your shoulders, you've got to get that under.  And you're cold.  I like jumping right in the fucking pool.  The problem with the warm water, your balls are playing.  They're bungeeing all the way down to the bottom of the pool.  No, you have to wear swim trunks with support.  A lot of support. 
[00:23:00]  You don't want to stretch those fucking volleys too far.  No, it's wonderful.  I like that.  And I know it's only for the summer.  And you think August might be higher?  August will probably be higher because we're already.  I know we're already well through August.  You know, most people.  And I've used the pool heater that has been on more than it has all through July.  I suggest a little charity thing.  The average person, their electric bill is way less than 100.  You can pay the electric bill for 200 to 300 people. 
[00:23:30]  And what am I going to do?  You have to turn everything off for a month.  Turn everything off for a month?  Blow me.  I am never doing that.  Also, the air conditioner takes up a lot.  Also, the lights, the lighting for the Live from the Compound shows take up a lot.  It's a blast furnace down there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's, oh, oh, oh, keg refrigerators.  Let me think.  The humidifier or the dehumidifier, humidifier, cooler for the wine. 
[00:24:00]  What about the refrigeration?  Refrigeration for the keg coolers.  Jesus.  I'm talking about for the wine cellar.  Oh, yeah.  The wine cellar refrigeration.  That's just running nonstop.  Oh, my God.  It's a catastrophe.  My place is shit compared to you.  I spend like a fucking, like I'm rich.  I have a nice place, but I don't have those fucking luxuries.  I like amenities.  I'm squeezed into a 10-room fucking condo here in Manhattan. 
[00:24:30]  No.  Actually, only a few rooms.  A flat.  Is there a red neon sign that blinks out your window?  Hotel.  Yeah, right.  And you hear the L train, even though there isn't one.  Be careful.  Every time you take a vacation, you get pulled from a market.  That's trash master.  Well, we don't have any other markets to lose.  Thank God.  Thank goodness. 
[00:25:00]  Let me say hi to Psycho Bob.  Psycho Bob.  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  Hey, I just wanted to go back to what you were talking about at the start of the show.  I think you've got to look on the positive side of things.  Yeah.  Anthony's got Castle Cumia.  Opie, you've got a brand new marriage and you're doing well.  And Jimmy's got more than enough money to pay for trannies.  What could be better?  Punch it out.  Jimmy would have more than enough money to pay for trannies, if not for certain things.  Mm-hmm.  I don't pay for trannies anyway. 
[00:25:30]  No.  They come over.  They're just friends.  Now they're just out of the kindness of their heart.  My bill was $43.  $43 electric bill?  Does Ant's electric bill include the heated pool?  Of course it does.  Sort of.  That's the biggest thing.  Because you've got the propane you've got to pay for.  Well, yeah, yeah.  But I'll tell you something.  The propane is lasting like the whole summer.  It's barely being used.  And they're suggesting you do a YouTube video of your electrical meter.  It's digital.  I would have liked to have seen it with the little spinny thing. 
[00:26:00]  But they probably ought to replace it because it probably sounded like a locomotive.  Would the spinny thing go flying round and round?  Oh, yeah.  The spinny thing would be going crazy.  It would break a spring or something?  Yeah.  It's digital now.  Someone's suggesting solar cells for the roof.  They're an eyesore.  They're an eyesore!  Not really.  Yes, they are.  There's big, stupid solar panels.  Fuck that.  I've got nice shingles on my roof.  Why am I going to put those goddamn things on my roof?  They're probably using the spinny thing if you're electric as a fan in the office. 
[00:26:30]  That old gag.  That's amazing.  That is really amazing.  Ant's wheel and his electric meter was mistaken for a UFO.  Yes, it would take off.  I don't want solar cells mucking up the lines of my house.  Look at that.  You put it on the back roof.  Shite.  You put it on the back roof.  I don't think that looks bad at all.  I like that.  But I'm in the back.  You're screaming.  That's where everybody hangs out.  That looks kind of modern. 
[00:27:00]  I kind of like that.  I don't mind the solar cells either, but how do you...  The thing is, how do you stop them from...  Like, if you want to just have darkness during the day, that's kind of...  Mm-hmm.  And...  What?  You can't stop the light from coming in if you want to cover them.  Oh, my God.  What?  Wait.  Are you being serious?  A hundred percent.  They're on your roof.  They're solar cells, right?  Yeah.  Does that...  They're not...  Oh, they're not windows.  It's your...  No, no.  Oh, I thought that's how...  I don't mean to laugh.  No, you can't.  I mean to laugh.  Yeah.  I swear to God. 
[00:27:30]  Jimmy never...  You barely fuck up.  They turn sunlight into electricity.  Yes, I know they do.  But I thought the one of the...  You thought they were like...  Heated, like almost...  Not magnifying glasses in the sense that they magnify anything.  But I thought that was the main principle, is that the sun coming through...  I didn't know how they worked.  Oh.  No, they just...  They just like kind of...  It changes the sun's energy light photons into electricity.  Oh, they don't go right through your roof?  I'm so stupid.  I swear to God.  I thought that your roof was like...  You could see into your house.  No! 
[00:28:00]  He goes...  He goes...  You could never turn off the lights.  That is classic, James.  I'm not kidding.  I really thought that.  First, the banana farm where the bananas grow out of the ground.  And now the solar panels that are just fucking windows into your house.  I really thought they were.  I think Jimmy's sleepy this week.  No, I think...  He's too busy preparing for that big gig with Jay Leno.  When I was younger...  I've never seen so many ha-ha Jimmys.  I swear to God, when I was a kid, my friend John Roswick lived down the street. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  And his family had like almost like a small window in the roof.  It kind of shone down...  Called as a skylight.  That's what it was.  But I always thought that's what a solar panel was.  Oh, no.  Like the heat would filter through there and somehow be trapped in the house.  There are a few ways to heat your house with solar or heat your pool or anything with solar.  One is skylights.  If you have the sun at a certain angle of your house, you could put skylights in and the sun shining through it makes it like a greenhouse effect with light coming through. 
[00:29:00]  Another way is a black background with piping going through it.  That water is circulated through.  The black absorbs the heat.  It makes the water hot.  And that could run your hot water or a pool heater, things like that.  And then the other way is electric, which is solar panels that turn sunlight photons into electricity.  How do they do that?  It's an amazing thing that uses silicon.  Basically just sand from like the beach.  And they turn that into a little plate that when sunlight hits it or any kind of light hits it, 
[00:29:30]  the photons from the actual light are transformed into electricity, which then you could store in a battery or use the light your house.  So we have this ability.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To take the sun and sand.  Yeah.  But we just don't pay attention to it.  But we don't.  Why don't we use it all the time?  Yeah.  It's being used a lot.  It really is being used a lot.  I mean, no, no.  Why do we use nothing but that?  Nothing but that.  It would collapse the economy.  What's the issue? 
[00:30:00]  They can't really figure out.  I think the issue is space per voltage.  Like you can't.  You would need a real lot of fucking solar panels to make enough energy to make up for what we use in coal and nuclear and shit like that.  We haven't come close to using it.  Well, we could.  But the technology's been there.  I mean, it's pretty much, you know, what satellites use.  They use nuclear now, too, a little bit.  Is it just not at a place where it's very convenient to have portable and stuff like that? 
[00:30:30]  No, they have portable.  And as a matter of fact, if you look at a lot of these.  What the fuck are we doing, then?  Well, if you look at, drive around, you'll see some things like those emergency police phones and things like that on the side of the highway.  And you'll see an angled black piece of metal above the box.  That's a solar panel that uses just solar energy to charge a battery that runs that utility, whether it's a light or a phone or something like that.  We use it here and there.  We use it here and there.  We just don't use it for mass consumption. 
[00:31:00]  They do have a few of them out in, like, the desert.  They use big things.  And keeping them clean is a problem, too, in areas where you get a lot of sunlight.  It's going to be pretty arid, and they would get very dusty.  But let me ask you, through clouds.  So high are people just to dust them constantly?  Clouds.  That's another problem, too.  Clouds, you don't get as much voltage with less light.  So you usually have some kind of capacitor or battery system that it charges.  Stores it, right?  Stores it.  Stores it.  And then, you know, but if you're going a while without the sun, you don't need. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Alaska, they'd be a big bus, but everywhere else they pretty much work.  Yeah, six months out of the year.  You would get enough sun to keep those things going, even if you had a bunch of cloudy rainy days.  We should use them a lot more.  Of course.  Well, we should.  A lot of proponents are saying that we should do that.  Who's saying no?  The gas company.  Fucking, I just hate everybody.  No, but that.  Mr. Cole, Ted Cole.  Cole's very good.  I see it in my stocking. 
[00:32:00]  I mess with my underpants.  But you can't just blow off one industry for a new industry.  It has to be a slow fade into the new technology.  But this isn't even new.  It's the new technology.  I understand that.  This has been around for so fucking long.  I understand that.  The sun?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The sun.  It's time to pump it up a little bit, but the problem is you can't just say goodbye to  one industry and say, this is the new industry, because that'll fuck up the economy, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a very sensitive environment there.  Yeah.  Very fragile environment, that economy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to slowly change things around. 
[00:32:30]  That's why they're saving the car companies.  You know?  Yep.  We should just let them go away and see what comes up in their place.  Exactly.  But we can't afford that hit.  Wind power is taking off more than solar panel right now.  Dude, you've seen the wind fields.  Yeah.  Or the, what do they call the, holy shit, I can't think.  What, the big windmills?  The windmills, yeah.  But the field of them?  Yeah.  When you're out west?  Yeah.  You see them there?  Holy shit.  How about the ones in Atlantic City? 
[00:33:00]  When you're driving into Atlantic City, you see those giant wind turbines?  Yeah, but out west, I don't know.  It's somewhere, I think, between Arizona and L.A., because I did that ride, and it goes  for miles and miles.  Yeah, because that's where there's some motherfucker winds.  And the windmills are just planted like it's like a crop.  Yeah.  These huge...  And how high are they?  They're farming the wind.  Oh, my God.  They gotta be fucking 10, 20 feet high.  They look like they're at least 100 feet high, each individual one, and there's just  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them as you're driving.  I forgot what highway.  That's all you see for almost an hour of driving. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, that's pretty good.  An hour you see this.  Wow, where's that?  In the Midwest?  Somewhere between, I believe, like I said, Arizona and L.A.  It's gotta be somewhere windy.  No, are they just...  Yeah, exactly.  Are they just being used for one area, or are they kind of going to a grid that's being  used in a lot of areas?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  It depends.  If you're a private owner of a windmill, you can sell the electricity back that you don't  use to the utility company, because it's gotta be piped into, you know, the grid.  I want to build a windmill in my apartment and blow on it. 
[00:34:00]  There are a couple of people trying to get them put on top of some buildings in New York.  Who's saying no?  To power certain things.  Well, it would look ugly to me.  Yeah, they don't want a bunch of windmills on top of buildings.  I don't know.  We got smoke stacks.  But I think one of them actually got an okay to do it, because it's gonna be aesthetically  correct.  The problem with this city, you got old school New Yorkers that think this place is meaningful.  New York City's a shithole.  You fucking come here, make as much fucking money as humanly possible.  Pay as much money to be here. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  And then get the fuck out of it and have a nice life somewhere else.  But there's actually old school New Yorkers that look at how beautiful New York is, and  we have to save this old building, and we can't have windmills on top of the buildings,  and we have to do this and that.  It's like, shut up.  Just be a tick to this city.  That's what it is.  Suck as much out of it as you can, and then fucking leave.  Wherever you go, it's all about making money in this city.  People just are looking for money, money, money, money.  You don't make real relationships.  I love this city.  You use this place and make as much money as possible, and then you get the fuck out. 
[00:35:00]  But put windmills up.  Like, why don't we just stop being these shallow fucking jizz buckets?  How many and where?  And there's a lot of people that don't want a shitload of fucking windmills.  Every eight feet.  A lot of people don't want windmills in their fucking line of sight.  Dude, they built a...  Too bad!  It's the old school New Yorkers.  You know that building in our neighborhood up a couple blocks?  Yeah.  That's a brand new building?  They protested that building going up for months.  Every weekend, they're out there, you can't have a new building. 
[00:35:30]  They wanted their views to be preserved.  They just wanted New York to be preserved.  They don't understand that, you know, you got the new buildings that actually make your  neighborhood look really fucking nice.  And meanwhile, how do you think the American Indians felt, you fucking shitheads, when your  buildings were going up?  Yeah, no kidding.  You think they were happy in 1920 when your building was going up?  Fuck you.  No kidding.  Assholes.  Like, they're the real New Yorkers, and anyone else moving into a big glass building is a  fake deal.  Shut up.  Yeah, exactly.  Just stop it.  But they're out there.  Paying taxes to you, you fucking pricks.  They're out there trying to preserve the old New York. 
[00:36:00]  You know, I understand you got to save some of the stuff, but most of the buildings are  just...  Who gives a shit?  Knock them down and put something nicer up.  It's a place where people shit.  This whole city is a place where people shit.  Don't you understand that yet?  Save the Empire State Building.  Save the Chrysler Building.  Save the Museum of Natural History.  Certain cobblestone roads.  All right, fine.  Right.  Oh, no, it's every building now.  I mean, there's a whole network of people.  They all are on the internet, and they go out and protest all the time. 
[00:36:30]  There seems to be a couple of people that I was looking at that have some information  on solar panels and why they're not very economical.  Like Josh in Michigan, I believe.  Sounds like a real dope to me, Ed.  Hey, Josh.  Morning, fellas.  Hello, Josh.  Hello.  What's your take on this solar panel?  I had a $1,000 electric bill a couple of months ago, and it floored me, so I did a little  research on solar panels, and one website I found said it takes 100 square feet to produce 
[00:37:00]  one kilowatt hour.  Wow.  What's a kilowatt hour now?  What does that mean?  I, to be honest, I have no idea.  Yeah, what's a kilowatt hour?  You should know this.  That's one kilowatt for an hour.  So what is that, like running an iPhone?  No.  What would that be?  Let me think.  What could a kilowatt hour do?  I don't know.  A kilowatt.  I don't know.  How many kilowatt hours does it take to, say, run a juicer?  I'm trying to think of how many light bulbs that is, to tell you the truth. 
[00:37:30]  My house, I think, used like 16 kilowatt hours for that month.  Oh, your house used 16 kilowatt hours for a month?  But how many rooms does your house have?  Oh, yeah.  Seven, eight.  All right.  So he's got it.  All right, Ant.  So it's 1,000 watts for one hour?  All right.  So if you have a 1,000 watt light bulb and you run it for an hour, that's one kilowatt hour.  All right.  A light bulb is about 100 watts.  I know. 
[00:38:00]  No, but I'm just saying.  That's 10 hours.  So that's like it's 10 light bulbs for an hour.  Or one light bulb for 10 hours.  No.  Yeah?  A 100-watt light bulb for 10 hours.  That's what 100 square feet.  So 10 foot by 10 foot section of solar panel will run your one light bulb.  For 10 hours.  For 10 hours.  Is that about right?  On a nice sunny day.  It just doesn't.  So what happens is it takes too much space and too much effort to focus.  Like, you can't just take something, say, the size of a coffee table and run your house for a week. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  Our priorities are all fucked up.  Because, I mean, our cell phones went from this, bricks, to nothing, because we figured  out how to get the batteries down to a tiny little size.  But the solar panels, oh, fuck that.  That's not important enough.  And they've had solar panels since the beginning of, like, space exploration.  Right.  They were like, oh, how are we going to power our thing?  Hey, we'll come up with solar panels.  Right.  So they've been around since, like, the fucking...  I don't even know how long they've been around.  What do you mean?  I thought they had a big cord from the space station. 
[00:39:00]  A giant, giant cord.  Yeah.  An extension cord.  And some guys just got to keep plugging it in and letting some more out.  Yeah, because Maury keeps kicking it out down at NASA.  Clumsy Maury.  He's an idiot.  He's cut his club foot like Dudley Moore.  They hate him down there.  Of course they do.  So, Josh, you don't like your solar panels?  No, they're just...  It takes too much.  They are ugly.  They're...  They're hideous.  All right, well, that's why we have to go to Bob, because he says that they revolutionized...  Revolutionized.  So you can hardly see them now. 
[00:39:30]  Is that true, Bob?  Really?  Yeah.  They sort of made it very flexible, almost like a film, to where you can...  They roll up like wallpaper, and you can mold them to any type of contour and surface, so  you can line them for every square footage of your roof space.  You're not limited just to the size of the panels themselves.  I think more and more people are at least looking into this technology.  What about thermite paint? 
[00:40:00]  Can you use that to heat your house?  I'm going to try to heat my house with thermite paint.  Shut it.  Were you there?  Were you there?  I was a Navy SEAL.  You have to sleep sometime.  Although I did like him a lot the last time we had him in.  He was fun.  Dude, I don't mind him at all.  I don't care.  Come on in.  Spout your bullshit.  It's amazing that he became a governor.  I don't got time to bleed.  Rewarding bad behavior. 
[00:40:30]  They reward good behavior.  They're right.  Psycho.  I can listen to him every day, and I can listen to Uncle Ted every day.  Uncle Ted.  Why haven't we had Uncle Ted on the show lately?  I don't know why we haven't had Uncle Ted.  Uncle Ted.  I like to buy bullets.  I like to buy guns.  I like to shoot things.  I'm Uncle Ted Sheckler.  No, you're Uncle Ted Sheckler.  I certainly am.  That's crazy.  I'm Uncle Theodore.  Uncle Theodore.  Jesse does for Sharpton.  Wait.  That's tough to do. 
[00:41:00]  He's smart.  Let me say hi to Spencer in Texas.  Spencer.  The great state of Texas checking in.  Spencer.  Good morning, boys.  How y'all doing today?  Never mind.  How's Texas?  Hey, y'all were talking about those wind farms earlier.  One of the largest wind farms in the U.S. is in West Texas.  There's 1,300 windmills.  They're about 200 feet high.  The problem with those is they generate so much electricity that there is a housing problem 
[00:41:30]  with electricity.  You know, they make so much that they have problems storing.  So they created these big generator systems, and they're actually selling electricity all over the eastern seaboard, all the way from Texas.  That's, you know.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  It generates so much power that they have a problem storing it.  How storing it, yes.  So right now they're in the process of building power lines from Texas all the way up to New York, Philadelphia, all over the east coast. 
[00:42:00]  Because, you know, they can't store it all out there right now.  Why can't they just pop it onto the grid directly?  Because it's such a desolate area out there.  There's nowhere to...  Well, they should have thought of that before they fucking popped them all up there.  No kidding.  Yeah, we do have a problem storing electricity.  It's very hard to economically store electricity because you just lose it.  So why don't you get a bunch of brains together and figure that out? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, they should.  We figure out shit in this country.  That seems to be the problem with solar panels and things like that is the actual storing of it.  Right.  When the clouds come and you've stored enough electricity and you start running on battery power, you're going to lose a lot of that.  It seems like we got the next technology.  It's just one of these...  We just got to kind of hone it and figure it all out.  Yeah.  And who cares if it looks ugly?  Half the country looks ugly already.  Just put it somewhere where people don't care if it looks ugly and then run some fucking lines there.  Speaking of not caring about ugly, you know that the phone towers are a big thing? 
[00:43:00]  There's places where they refuse to have the phone towers.  Oh, cell towers?  Cell towers because the neighborhood, man.  And it's usually a lot of rich fucks and they don't want those towers in their neighborhood.  Yep.  So then they figured out...  You had to have seen these by now.  They figured out to make the towers look like trees.  Look like trees.  But they're the worst looking trees ever.  Like when you get an artist and go, all right, look. 
[00:43:30]  Look, artist.  This is the problem.  We need a cell tower that looks like a tree so the locals don't notice that it's a cell tower.  Help me out.  And it's probably got to, you know, stand up to the weather and stuff, so...  I was driving north of the city two days ago and they're...  What fucking road was I on?  Whatever.  The hutch or something.  And they have these cell towers that are supposed to look like trees.  They look ridiculous.  They look worse than actually if you were looking at a cell tower.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  That's what happened when I went hiking and got lost.  There were no cell towers because people would not allow cell towers to be put on certain mountaintops.  Yeah, because they think their area is important.  I got no signal.  Yeah.  So I'm sitting there, you know, stuck in the... trapped in the woods without a cell phone.  That's when I bought my satellite phone.  Every winter I escape to the woods of Connecticut.  There's some really, really nice towns in these faraway places in Connecticut.  Problem is, though, it's the year 2009 and you can't... 
[00:44:30]  Like you just said, you can't use your cell phone.  And I'm not camping.  I'm not in the woods.  I'm in, like, civilization.  But the locals just don't want the ugly cell tower.  So they would rather sacrifice the use of a cell phone to live in these areas.  I don't go anywhere where I can't get a cell signal without the satellite phone now.  Got to take it with you.  If you're going to be somewhere without a signal, in the middle of the woods,  or if you're traveling somewhere that takes you over wacky fucking places where your plane crashes... 
[00:45:00]  Right.  Oh, my God.  I'm calling.  Hello.  Hello.  Help me.  Help me.  I'm alive out here.  Danny just had a picture of one of the cell towers that looked like...  Oh, they looked like...  Look at that thing.  Look how stupid it looks.  It looks like...  It looks like one of those fake Christmas trees.  A bad fake Christmas tree.  That you get.  Like...  All right.  It's a big regular tower, but they just stuck branches...  Right.  Pine-looking branches into it.  I mean, it's a very good idea, but get somebody that knows what a tree looks like to help you out.  It doesn't fit the surrounding trees at all. 
[00:45:30]  No.  It's like...  It looks better, though, than fucking, you know...  Honestly, when you see them, they don't look better.  They look terrible.  They stand out.  They look ridiculous.  I think they should wrap tinfoil around them so they look like big tinfoil men.  Tinfoil men?  He runs away.  Frightened.  Make them into big dildos or something.  I would love that.  Just something that makes you chuckle.  Ah...  Where else?  By the way, when we're done with this, before I forget, just put it on the table.  No, you can't. 
[00:46:00]  The disgusting Daily News...  What do they do this time?  ...once again refuses to mention race when it's black and white.  Ah, of course.  Yeah, we'll do that after.  Makes me fucking sick, this paper.  And...  And...  We have an update on Dominic Barbera.  Oh, yeah.  Wait till you hear the latest.  With his, um...  Wait till you hear the latest on that one.  Uh...  Thanks to people like Ant, they are running lines through my backyard to power his house.  Is that true?  Well...  Let me... 
[00:46:30]  Hold on.  Let me go to Todd in West Virginia.  Todd.  Hey, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Yes?  Hello.  Anthony, I'd like to thank you.  Yeah.  Us here in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia are getting these big-ass power lines ran through  our backyards and farms and everything.  And the best thing about it is we're not even going to take advantage of the added capacity.  It's all supporting New York, Maryland.  That's it.  New Jersey.  So, thank you, my friend. 
[00:47:00]  No problem.  It's 2009.  That's right.  Juice it up.  Flip the switch.  That's right.  2012 is right around the corner.  Who gives a shit?  I want you to hear a buzzing 24 hours a day and have three-headed children.  Are you scared?  And become sterile.  Are you scared of the year 2012?  2012?  2012.  That's supposed to be the end of the world date?  According to the Mayans, that's the latest end of the world date.  Yeah, well, the Mayans had a great civilization.  Where are they now? 
[00:47:30]  Well...  Show me one Mayan.  Let's go to Colorado.  Colorado.  You're next on the O-B-N-A-D-O.  Yes.  Good evening.  Hello.  Good evening.  Jimmy, I just have a question for you.  Would you rather have solar electricity or food on your table?  Well, that's a very challenging observation, sir.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Let me answer.  Hold on, and I'm going to challenge what this guy has to say.  Go ahead, Colorado.  I want to say what I'd rather have on my table.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy. 
[00:48:00]  A hat and a pepper shaker.  Well, I'll tell you what's happened here in Colorado is in south-central Colorado,  they took over an old 85-acre potato farm and turned it into a solar power plant that  generates less than one-one-hundredth of the power used in the city of Alamosa, which  is a city with a population of under 5,000.  That sounds like a pretty shitty move. 
[00:48:30]  Well, yeah, kind of.  Now, here's the other thing.  The county, or two counties, annexed 15,000 acres of potato farms in that area.  They're going to initially build a 10,000-acre solar facility that will provide power for  this entire valley with an option for 5,000 acres more.  But, like I said, they're with a whole bunch of farms in that area. 
[00:49:00]  So, and the other thing is keep in mind, you know, the liberals want solar power.  There was just an opportunity to build a 500,000-acre solar facility in the desert of California  that would provide power for a large portion of California.  But Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein didn't want it built because it would endanger the  desert tortoise.  The desert tortoise.  That's what Pelosi looks like.  That piece of shit. 
[00:49:30]  I can't stand her.  Well.  So, you know, just something to keep in mind.  And, you know, and the wind power is great as long as you don't mind killing birds.  Because that's the problem they have with wind farms.  Ah, who cares about birds?  How many fucking birds do you really need?  Birds.  For real.  In some areas, it's actually killing endangered species.  Who cares?  Endangered species.  Well, if the dumb bird can't figure out that he shouldn't be flying through a windmill.  Yeah.  Well, the problem is if the windmills turn too fast, the birds can't see the blades. 
[00:50:00]  And the other thing is, too, with these windmill farms, if the wind is above 30 miles an hour,  the windmills have to shut off.  Yeah, true.  They'll actually burn their motors up if they go too fast.  Wow.  That's true.  They don't shut up.  Well, you know a lot about this.  Thank you, sir.  No problem.  The only thing I was going to say is there's a lot of farmers out there that aren't making  money off their land anymore, so I would see where they would like this option.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck the potatoes.  You know?  Fuck the bad-a-tas. 
[00:50:30]  Bad-a-tas.  Bad-a-tas.  Bad-a-tas.  I don't say bad-a-tas anymore.  I'm just going to say, yeah, fuck the bad-a-tas.  Let's put some windmills up.  There are roof shingles, solar panels now.  Mass was supposed to convert to all windmill power, but got turned down because it would ruin  their view of the ocean.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that, and the windmills were supposed to be way off shore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Way off.  Way off.  We don't want a certain kind of power that's better because we want to look at water.  Dude, we really are a bunch of dumb motherfuckers. 
[00:51:00]  We do.  As human beings, the solutions are right in front of our face, but we will just fuck it  up.  We want to look at water.  Why don't you stare into the toilet?  We will just fuck it up in the end.  Yeah, we always do.  It's great.  Oh, let's go to Josh in Arizona.  Josh.  Hey there, Josh.  Good morning, fellas.  How are you?  Hello, Josh.  Hey, I was just going to talk to you guys about the cell phone towers.  You were talking about trees.  Well, down here in Tucson, Arizona, they make the cell phone towers look like huge saguaro  cactuses. 
[00:51:30]  Do they look pretty good, too?  It's amazing.  Like, you drive down the street, you see this huge cactus, you would never know, but they  pull off the top and it's a cell phone tower.  So they look good.  Yeah, they look great.  Because up here in the Northeast, the tree tower thing they're using looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think what they should do is put little blue circles on it and tell everybody it's a giant  blueberry bush.  Hang a little balloons off it.  Go to Tucson and do a show.  I would love to, actually.  Have you ever done Tucson? 
[00:52:00]  I've done Phoenix twice with Dice, like, years ago.  I never did it.  Since I've been doing radio, I've not done Arizona at all.  Phoenix gets all the good stuff.  We're the bastard child.  I would like to go to Tucson, actually.  Go to Tucson, Jimmy.  What are you waiting for?  I would.  Book it right now.  I would.  That cactus looks silly.  It's like robo-cactus.  Because they got the top off right now.  Yeah, yeah.  That does look a lot better.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, imagine hunting it.  Is this guy true?  Did he do the calculations?  Am I actually using...  Yeah, we're going there.  Wow. 
[00:52:30]  Lee in New York, just stay there.  You're one away from Lee, but there was one more.  Oh, Lee.  Yeah, the cell phone industry guy.  Yes.  Neil in New Hampshire.  Yeah, morning, boys.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Neil.  Hey, yeah, those ugly-ass pines, they're called monopines in the industry.  What, the ugly trees?  Yeah, yeah.  They got one up there on the hutch in the 684 split, probably the one you were seeing there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've seen that one.  Yeah, why...  They're a motherfucker to put up, too, and they're just ugly. 
[00:53:00]  Why can't you guys figure out something that looks better, and then maybe these snooty towns won't mind having a cell tower?  Boy, they're working on it.  Like the guy said from Arizona, they've got cactuses now that the antennas are surrounded by RF transparent material.  Right.  And they do a really good job.  I mean, you can put them in a church steeple, take the whole steeple out, and replace it with this RF transparent material, and you'd never know the difference.  Yeah, people are a little edgy about that one. 
[00:53:30]  I heard one church wanted to do that, and then the parishioners were like, eh, we don't know what the cell towers do to people.  Well, that's a good point.  Oh, yeah.  We run into that.  We're doing a build-out right now in Manhattan and doing a lot of rooftop sites.  And, boy, the stuff you hear about cancer, this, that, and the other.  Cancer?  You should only get cancer.  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't realize that everything you touch in your house, the electric, is putting off more RF energy than the cell towers are. 
[00:54:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, as you stand with your face against the microwave oven, just seeing if your food is cooking.  All right, sir.  Have a good one, boy.  Thank you.  And, finally, yeah, this is, somebody did some math on Ant.  So, wait.  Can't possibly be true.  A lot of people joining us, Ant, started the energy discussion by saying that his electric bill for the month of June.  New record.  Was $2,600.  $2,600 for the month of July. 
[00:54:30]  For the electric, not electric and gas.  Yes, just electricity.  So, Lee kind of did some math for you.  Lee?  Yeah.  Hey, Lee.  Hey, what's up?  Hi.  If you take, I just went through this with my electric company.  They're, like, ripping me off.  I'm paying $450,000, and that's an insane amount.  So, your pain's crazy.  But if you take the amount of watts you use times .19 divided by 1,000, that's how much you're paying an hour.  So, I reverse calculated that, and it works out to about 12,100,000 watts you're using. 
[00:55:00]  So, I'm using 12 million watts a month?  12,100,000.  Yeah, let's not blow off the 100,000.  That's big, too.  12.1 million watts.  12.1 million watts.  Nope.  I'm not sure.  I don't know how many watts make a gigawatt, but that might be 1 gigawatt.  I know.  That's 1.2.  How many watts does it take to fire up, like, a stadium for a sporting event? 
[00:55:30]  Oh, shit.  I want to see if it's comparable.  That's a lot of wattage.  That's a lot of wattage, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I don't think I'm putting off as much as Citi Field or anything.  No, but...  Probably winning more games.  Yeah, ugh.  The Mets.  All right.  Well, they won last night.  Leave my Mets alone.  Now, they're only fucking nine games under 500, something like that.  Yankees won.  Yeah, I know.  Best team in baseball. 
[00:56:00]  So the Sox, though.  Yeah, whatever.  Goddamn bastards.  No, what I want to know is, like, how much it costs to fire up Citi Field or Yankee Stadium.  And then we use how much you just spent.  And how long I could power.  Yeah, could you power up an inning of baseball?  How long can my monthly bill power Citi Field's lighting?  If anybody out there wants to take on that problem, that would be awesome.  Yeah.  And let us know what you come up with.  Why don't we take our first break? 
[00:56:30]  All right, let's do that.  Jimmy's annoyed.  We're going to do this.  I'll say this.  This story ruined my day.  I'm so disgusted with the fucking media and the way they report things.  Oh, I know.  And these fucking...  It's ruined my day, this story.  Well, we'll get into it right after the break, I promise.  And we'll also do the Dominic Barber thing, because he's just a...  Yeah, this new defense is really great.  We'll explain.  It's worth it.  We've been following the story of the lady that went the wrong way and killed pretty much everybody in her way.  And now Dominic Barber got involved, saying she couldn't possibly be drunk, and now... 
[00:57:00]  What a shock, a lawyer not behaving honorably.  Oh, I know.  It's really surprising.  Wait till you hear what he's going with now.  It's very hard to believe.  Lawyers don't really behave very honorably.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're very honorable people.  Dude, they're great.  The Dominic Barber thing...  ...contracts, and they're fucking ends of the bargain.  They're very good people.  Exactly.  Dominic Barber thing might annoy you even more than the story you got in front of you.  Impossible.  No, that is really annoying.  We'll see.  Impossible.  We'll see.  For anything to annoy me more than this fucking story.  Yeah.  Wow, I can't wait to get back from the break. 
[00:57:30]  It's fucking...  The story itself...  I don't even want to know until after the break.  Okay.  But the way they report it is just...  They just...  They're just shit.  Shit.  Shit.  You got a plug there, Jimmy?  That'll calm you down a little bit.  You know, no...  Tomorrow's the day, right?  That tickets go on sale for...  For October 2nd, yeah.  Tomorrow for the Bayshore.  Thanks.  Bayshore show at the Bolton...  B-O-U-L-T-O-N center.org.  But it's a noon on sale, which is just the way they do it. 
[00:58:00]  So it's like I can't...  You know, tomorrow at noon, Friday at noon for October 2nd.  It's a very small theater.  And I'll be in Wildwood this...  A week from this weekend.  Nice.  October 20...  August 21, 22.  I wish I wasn't going away.  I'm looking forward to doing Wildwood.  I like the shore.  I would love to check out the Wildwood gig.  It's a small comedy club that I kind of came up in at Casbah.  I used to go there for fucking $375 for the week.  I like walking that boardwalk down.  I love it down there, man.  I've been there in fucking 10 years.  North Wildwood or regular Wildwood?  It's regular Wildwood.  I want to say it's on Atlantic and Spicer, if I remember correctly. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  My buddy, Mark Vito, has run that club for many years.  All right.  Very good.  I just want to say quickly, please, I implore you to watch Sean Hannity this evening.  Are you on tonight?  Where?  I will be on.  Who are you on with?  Do you know?  I have no idea.  I have to...  Tell him I said hello.  Get that email.  Tell him I said hi.  I will, of course.  They've forgotten about me.  No, they don't like me.  They don't like me.  They don't like me for some reason.  Why?  They bumped me since June twice.  Oh, my God.  Because they...  Maybe I'll get bumped.  They only go with the Republicans.  No.  I'm in the middle enough, though. 
[00:59:00]  True.  No.  I don't know what I did wrong.  They lean your way.  Just say you hate Obama.  Lean his way.  Lean his way.  They're all lying on their left side.  Or right side.  Right side.  Right side.  Jesus.  I couldn't have been wronger.  50-50 shot.  Dude, but that's called completely blowing it.  Yes.  I understand that.  Yeah, and we know.  The joke meant well, though.  It had a good heart.  It just fell apart at the end. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  Poon and Piener, we'll be back. </pre>
