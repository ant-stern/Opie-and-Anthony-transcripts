<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about the film *Full Metal Jacket*, focusing on the perceived disconnect between its boot camp and Vietnam War sections.  Listeners offered explanations, ranging from the character's promotion to philosophical interpretations of the film's duality.  This segued into Sergeant Hartman impersonations and prank calls.  The conversation then shifted to violent video games like *Soldier of Fortune 2*, *Kingpin*, and *Grand Theft Auto 3*,  with detailed descriptions of their graphic content and a focus on the portrayal of terrorists.  Listeners called in to share their gaming experiences and speculate about *Grand Theft Auto IV*.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to Jim Norton's recounting of a disappointing $225 encounter with a dominatrix. He described the experience as insincere, detailing the dominatrix's behavior, attire, and the dungeon setting.  He humorously recounted specific details including the use of a "puppy pad," spitting, and the unexpected intrusion of Opie's image into his thoughts during the encounter. This segment also touched upon Norton's awkward behavior with friends and their girlfriends, showing his stomach to them.

The show then veered into a multifaceted discussion about the death and legacy of Ann Landers, including a risqu√© letter read on air and speculation on the authenticity of modern advice column letters. This was interwoven with extensive discussion of Ted Williams' cryopreserved head, featuring audio clips from family members and humorous sound effects.  Numerous Michael Jackson jokes and listener calls punctuated the segment.  This part also included a "Sergeant Hartman" prank call and a significant prank call targeting Dave Douglas, a recently fired former boss, involving a pie and a dead plant delivery.  A caller named Sean, with a world peace plan, was repeatedly put on hold, becoming a running gag. A short comedy tape from show intern Francine was played, featuring her observations and opinions on various people and things, followed by a brief news update about David Hasselhoff's hospitalization for alcohol poisoning.  The hosts frequently interrupted with jokes and impersonations. The possibility of Francine hosting a weekly segment was discussed.

The show continued with a discussion about a $170 minibar bill, leading into a drunken David Hasselhoff skit.  Hasselhoff's music was played and critiqued.  The conversation returned to Ted Williams' cryopreserved head, including a purported audio clip describing the "defrosting" process, along with speculation about his son's motivations.  The movie *Vanilla Sky* was briefly discussed in relation to the themes of freezing and cloning.  A "What Did We Learn?" segment featured callers offering comedic and often vulgar interpretations of the day's events.  Boy George's altercation with Eminem was also discussed, and the show concluded with a promotion of a nude photo contest on their website.  Multiple callers contributed to the show's chaotic and vulgar nature throughout the final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. Hey. We can't fool around with our little clip machine today because we're too busy getting new clips on the clip machine. Oh you said clip machine. Clip. Right. Clip machine. Wow that sounded close. We're getting our sounds together for our groovy Ted Williams bit that's coming up later on in the program today. Groovy. Frozen Ted. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. We started the show with that clip from 
[00:00:30]  Full Metal Jacket. Full Metal Jacket. We were talking about this in the back office really fast just a quick stupid thing. I was watching the movie coming back from LA. Yes. And I've seen the movie many times but then it hit me while I was viewing it this time. That movie's like two different movies. Two completely different movies yeah. And I want to know why. There's Kubrick he was a lunatic. But there's got to be a story. Like. Well what's his name there gets blown away by  Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Yeah he gets blown away. Yeah. And then the second movie starts. Yeah then they're in the NAM. There's no real connection to the first 45 minutes of the movie. Yeah I don't know I think he was just kind of trying to go for the whole boot camp thing. And then the Vietnam thing you know. So. Yeah but the only other person that was connected to the first part of the movie was Cowboy. Right. That was it. When Joker goes over to the NAM. Right. And hooks up with Cowboy briefly. 
[00:01:00]  Before Cowboy gets it. Buys it. That sniper scene was pretty good. I kind of dug that. That was. Yeah. That was the only scene worth watching. Yeah. The second half of the movie. And then the famous Misahani. The old. The old. The old. The old marine guy was probably the greatest character in the history of motion. That was good. What's that some kind of sick joke. How you got a peace sign on his helmet. The duality of man sir. The duality of man. But there's got to be a story there. I know Stan 
[00:01:30]  Kubrick took a really really long time to film his movies. And I'm thinking. Yeah. Maybe these guys had other movies they needed to start. And said look. I got to leave. I'm sorry. I got to leave. So halfway through this movie. I got to leave. I mean Matthew Modine looks about three years old or two. In the second half of the movie. So. Whatever. It's just a stupid thing to throw out there. If someone knows the story behind that. Because it doesn't make sense. 
[00:02:00]  That first 45 minutes. Probably 20 to 30 times. You could shut it off after that. You just saw a whole movie. No. You don't understand. With the DVD thing. That's what I've done over the years. Yeah. That's why I'm bringing this up today. Because I finally had some time to kill. And decided. You know. I haven't seen the second part of the movie in a while. And I realized why. Because it just blows. Compared to the first part. Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  He never really went anywhere after that. No. Because he was awful. I don't think he's related to Alec or any of them. No. No. No. You talk the talk. Do you walk the walk? You remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Awful. I know. I remember that movie. My Bodyguard. Yeah. It was great. Who was in that also? Ruth Gordon and Matt Dillon. Yeah. Matt Dillon was in that. Leave him alone. Moody. And the awful kid with the horrible clogged lactose intolerance sinuses. 
[00:03:00]  The little redheaded boy. Yeah. And Adam Baldwin. And Ruth Gordon. Wasn't the kid that needed the bodyguard the same kid that was in that Bill Murray movie? Don't know. He never. Oh, wait. Wait. Meatballs. He might have been. But he really didn't go anywhere after that. I mean, Martin Muller was in it, too. Chris Makepeace. Wow. Yes. Is that him? It certainly is. Wow. Where the hell did that come from? A little tussleable head of hair on him. Curly and tight enough where your hand wouldn't just slide off the scalp. 
[00:03:30]  But not so tight where you couldn't tussle the whole head. Anthony, what's going on? Hey. What's up, ONA? Hey. 
[00:04:00]  Morton, what's going on? I was just calling about, you said, Matthew Modine looks about three years older. Yeah.  When he goes to Vietnam. Yes.  You notice when he's walking down the street, he meets the guy, the lieutenant. He's talking to him looking for the, he's looking for cowboys. Yeah.  He said, I'm Sergeant Joker. So obviously he's gone up and ranked from a private to a sergeant. And that doesn't happen, you know, overnight.  I mean, that kind of lets you know that there is some time that passes. But as for like the rest of the storyline, I couldn't help you. 
[00:04:30]  All right. Thank you, Anthony. Later on.  Cool. I mean the history of the actual filming of the movie. Rob. Rob's here.  Hey, what's going on, guys? Rob, go ahead.  Rob, why don't you come in for the big win?  Why don't you join the team?  The scene you're talking about?  The big team. Yeah.  That's the point of the whole movie. It was all about the duality of man. That union thing, sir.  And that's why there's two parts to the movie.  The first part is showing how they make the men into the killing machine.  The second part was them as the killing machine. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, but the thing you have to realize is all I've ever asked of my Marines,  they obey my orders as they would the word of God.  That could be the greatest thing ever said.  But say it as the guy.  All I've ever asked of my Marines, they obey my orders as they would the word of God.  That guy sometimes is hit.  No.  You got him down, man.  Who doesn't? He's the greatest.  Nice.  How do you not?  All right, guys.  All right, bye.  Take it easy.  That big lie pit full of Vietnamese bodies?  Great.  Tommy.  What's up, guys? 
[00:05:30]  Hey, Tommy.  What's up, Jimmy?  Tommy.  Listen, I never knew there was an end to that movie.  I thought it just ended after the...  I just always shut off after that part with the boot camp.  The whole movie sucks after that.  M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.  Yeah, I never seen it in that movie.  Cool. All right, bro.  Love you, fellas.  All right, bye.  Godspeed.  Oh, my God.  All right, we'll play a Sergeant Hartman prank call.  I wish we had more of that guy, man.  Huh?  I wish we had that...  We don't have the DVD here, do we?  We'll get it for tomorrow.  I never bought it.  That's what's good about doing a show every day.  We, you know, we start on something today and we finish it tomorrow. 
[00:06:00]  Are you going to say goodbye to me, Mac?  We got part two of our whole Ted Williams thing we're planning for tomorrow.  We're actually working on this radio show.  No way.  Yes, we are.  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  My name is Jeet.  That name sounds like royalty.  Are you royalty?  Huh?  Do you suck...  What?  Do you suck...  Yeah.  Bull...  I'll bet you can suck a golf ball through a garden hole.  Jerry, my ritual battle.  Talk to you like on this phone, man. 
[00:06:30]  What you doing, man?  You don't scare me.  Hello?  What's your name, scumbag?  Raj?  Well, no...  Come on, sir.  Talk to you like on this seriously.  Hello?  Hello?  Come on, f*** yourself, or I will unscrew your head and f*** you in your neck.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's that?  You think I'm cute?  Do you think I'm funny?  Who?  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and f*** my sister.  F*** your sister.  What are you, little magnet?  You make me want to film it.  I...  Are you about to call me an a*****? 
[00:07:00]  Who are you?  Dormer Pyle.  Huh?  Dormer Pyle.  I don't understand.  Who are you?  Dormer Pyle.  Huh?  Who are you?  No f***.  I'm not f***ed.  Who are you?  You at least don't f*** yourself, or I will unscrew your head and f*** down your neck.  Anytime, okay?  Come on, let's go.  Ah!  One, two, three.  Bye.  We got a bunch of those.  We'll play during the day today. 
[00:07:30]  Jesse, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  No, Stanley Kubrick made the movie in three parts.  Okay.  There's the boot camp, the Tet Ceasefire, and then the sniper.  And there's a Mickey Mouse reference in the middle or toward the end of all three.  And there's supposed to be symbolism in that.  I can't...  I don't know what it is.  Wow, you know what, man?  I don't remember the second one.  What is this Mickey Mouse in my head?  You're right.  In the first part, right before he gets shot, and then Mickey Mouse...  Exactly.  What's the other one, the Tet Offensive? 
[00:08:00]  They're singing the song right after the sniper, and the one in the Tet Defense, there's  the Mickey Mouse, like, bobbing head doll, or whatever, like a little doll right where  the, you know where the dead chink is?  Wow, I did not...  What the hell's that all about, though?  I have no idea, but there's one in all three.  That might have been...  There was a thing Kubrick would do, too.  Obviously, he had the long shot, and he would also do something with the patterns.  I don't know exactly what...  Maybe that was just part of his...  It might not have meant anything.  Maybe that was just something he did, little weird things like that.  Yeah.  Can I sound more like a dummy?  I'm sorry to ruin your brilliant point. 
[00:08:30]  Maybe he just did that thing.  I do, thanks.  Come on.  That thing.  Wow, I never noticed that.  Good point.  All right, we're going to finish that.  Whatever.  Just a stupid, quick little observation.  We're jelly green giants with guns.  Yeah, these are great days, bros.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Happy birthday, zipper head.  It's his birthday.  How great is that?  That's your negative, Raptor Man.  I hated Raptor Man.  Stunk.  All right.  Really awful.  Hey, I was saying in the back office that you're into a new video game there, a computer 
[00:09:00]  game, I should say.  Yeah, playing Soldier of Fortune 2.  I had loved Soldier of Fortune, the original.  And two, very good.  One part of the game that really makes it great is the body parts fly off as you hit  them.  You know, it's cool to see the blood and the body go down, but when you hit somebody with  the full automatic shotgun and rip their head off, it gives you that little tinge.  There was a game you were playing.  Oh, that's nice.  There was a game you were playing about two years ago that had that feature.  Which one was it?  Kingpin. 
[00:09:30]  Kingpin.  Kingpin had that same feature.  Yes.  But now, you know, you give a couple of years in the video game industry and you're talking  leaps and bounds.  You're dating yourself if you start a discussion about Kingpin.  Right.  But this one, Soldier of Fortune 2, very good game.  The weapons are amazing.  Sniper rifle, which is always one of my favorites.  Zoom in 20 times.  There's some guy standing on a balcony.  He's looking around with his gun.  You take him out in the head.  It all depends on where you hit him in the head.  If you hit him in the top of the head, the whole top of his head on the back will fly off 
[00:10:00]  and you'll just see brain matter and blood splat against the wall.  Or you could hit him right in the eye and he puts a sick look on his face as he just drops  to the balcony.  Very cool goddamn game with great weapons.  One problem with it.  Okay.  A lot of the video games, movies, everything.  They love dealing with the terrorist angle now.  So, um, Soldier of Fortune 2, a lot of anti-terrorism that we're doing in the game. 
[00:10:30]  Going around, you're killing terrorists.  Sounds like a blast, don't it?  Who doesn't want to fantasize about grabbing some hardcore gear, getting out there, and blasting some terrorists?  Right?  Sounds like a great game.  Sounds great.  Until you realize the terrorists that I've been killing in this game are Hong Kong guys,  Colombians, which are like huge terrorists, I guess.  Ooh, they've just been tearing apart our nation.  I think they've been knocked out of the top ten terrorist list for this country. 
[00:11:00]  When is the last time Colombian terrorists have really made an impact here, where I could  give a flying F about killing a Colombian terrorist?  What I'm trying to say is, if you're making a computer game about terrorism, and you're  giving your guy plenty of great weapons to blow terrorists away, sometimes when they  have fallen down, like I'll shoot the guys and they'll hit the knees and go for that death  fall, you could take an arm off, and it's beautiful. 
[00:11:30]  The only thing is, there's not one goddamn raghead in the whole game.  Now that would make, what video game company wants to make a fortune right now?  Yeah, no one has the balls to step forward and say, hey, here's a game about terrorism,  and you get to, you know, blow away the towelhead terrorists.  Do you, are you afraid of offending the goddamn terrorists?  Is that what you're doing?  We know who the terrorists are.  They're, they're, they're from, uh, uh, the Middle East. 
[00:12:00]  So give me Middle Eastern guys.  You know, ragheads.  Give me an airport setting.  Give me some fun stuff that I can relate to that's going to make me like, oh, I just  ripped his head off.  It's fantastic.  They're just too scared.  Country's too PC.  I get it.  One of the gaming companies has the balls to do this.  I've seen a couple of games where there have been some, some Middle Eastern guys in the  game.  So, and I played those.  But it's, I'm saying if you're basing a whole game. 
[00:12:30]  But they're not committing, Anthony.  Right.  They pop up here and there.  Exactly.  They pop up.  If you're committing a game to, uh, fighting terrorists, your, your, your character is out  there blasting away a terrorist.  I want the terrorists that I hate.  All of a sudden, I'm on a goddamn, uh, junk.  I'm on a junk.  One of those boats, those, those chinky boats.  And the guy, oh, get him.  Oh, who not to wang.  I got no problem with the Hong Kong guy. 
[00:13:00]  I got no problem with the Hong Kong guy.  I think we're friends with the Hong Kong guy.  Oh, I blew his goddamn head off, though.  I rigged the whole boat.  Because we, because we never forget.  We never forget.  The grenade launcher is amazing.  Because I'll be sitting there.  I got like the, uh, I got the, the full automatic rifle.  I'm just like, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.  And then you look and go, all right, now there's quite a few guys coming at me.  Boom.  You just see the blood and heads splatter against the walls.  And it's great. 
[00:13:30]  You feel great.  You're playing a great goddamn game.  But where are the terrorists that I want to kill?  That's what I'm saying.  And the same thing with that goddamn movie.  Collateral damage.  Ah, ah.  I, I, I read, I was in the hotel.  It was on.  I'd seen every other movie in the hotel.  Was someone holding you hostage?  No, I know.  I, I always watch those horrid Arnold movies.  Ah, do it.  Ah, every movie.  Ah.  Ah, but, uh, he's fighting terrorists. 
[00:14:00]  He's a firefighter.  This was the, the lamest movie.  Here's the premise.  He's a firefighter.  His wife and son are killed by terrorists.  They're having lunch somewhere outside the Colombian consulate.  What?  When, when a motorcycle cop pulls up and leaves a bike there and he's the Colombian terrorist  and blows up the place.  His wife and, uh, his son die.  Then he goes to Colombia to hunt down the head. 
[00:14:30]  A bunch of, a bunch of pussies in Hollywood.  Yep.  And, and.  I bet you that scene was a lot different before 9-11 because that was the movie that was just  about done.  They changed the whole goddamn thing.  It was supposed to be Middle Eastern terrorists.  I guarantee it.  And they buckled under, what, who, who, who are we afraid of offending?  Who are we afraid of offending?  Because I'm watching it going, I cannot relate to the Colombian terrorism thing.  Nope.  I, you know something?  There was a point in the 80s where I really enjoyed, uh, Colombia's products. 
[00:15:00]  You know, I, I really didn't have much of a problem with Colombia.  And I still do not, I, well, I drink the coffee.  I like the Colombian coffee.  Why, why, if, if you're going to be fighting terrorists in a movie or, or in a video game  in this country, they should be the terrorists, which are the Middle Eastern monkeys.  Nah, but you know what, though?  You really can't stereotype because, you know.  Yeah, that's it.  With the exceptions, I mean, you did have 9-11.  Yeah.  And Pan Am. 
[00:15:30]  And you did have, you know, a few other things like maybe the coal and, you know, Israeli  soccer team and, you know, maybe a whole bunch of other little incidents, you know,  like the embassy bombings, or, you know, the Iranian hostages taking over.  Right.  No, you know, I mean, you don't want to, you don't want to pigeonhole anybody, though.  You know, like the Achille Laurel.  Right.  You don't want to just say that, like, you know, there's one group of people.  Sure.  You know, 1993 World Trade Center bombing.  Right.  You don't want to pigeonhole somebody caught taking explosives across to, to try to attack  the Seattle Space Needle for 2,000.  Were they, were they, uh, Asians? 
[00:16:00]  Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, they were coincidentally Middle Eastern guys.  Ah, right.  But people were right, like, hey, we don't always want to be, uh, pegged as terrorists.  And, you know, by golly, you shouldn't be.  Right.  You absolutely shouldn't be.  I don't know if I mentioned, uh, did I mention Pan Am?  Right.  Did I mention Lockerbie?  Good.  I'm glad I mentioned that one.  And I'm glad Leon Klinkhofer pushed over.  And, uh, yeah, we mentioned that.  All right, good.  They have these incendiary grenades in this game that are amazing.  You pull that pin, you throw it, it just blasts fire everywhere.  And you can see them running around, ah, ah, and as they're running on fire, what do 
[00:16:30]  you do?  You shoot them.  Oh, you'll rake the hell out of them.  Of course.  240-something Marines killed in their barracks.  But they're Colombians, Anthony.  Yeah, Colombians.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey.  Oh, that great game, Soldier of Fortune, it's phenomenal.  Yeah, I love it.  I mean, you can shoot somebody in the leg, blow their leg off.  Next thing you know, they'll be screaming and holding their leg, and at the same time,  you can aim for another body part.  Yeah, it's great.  They don't die right away.  That's what I love about this. 
[00:17:00]  The old, uh, a lot of the older video games, the first-person shooters, you'd shoot the  guy, and no matter where you hit him, as long as you hit him, he'd fall down dead.  This guy, you shoot him in the leg, and even if the leg doesn't come off, he drops his  weapon and grabs his leg, and until he feels a little better and there's a weapon nearby,  he'll just cower in the corner.  And the funny thing is...  You'd blow his head off.  And he'll start to scream almost the kind of way Arnold does.  Ah!  Exactly.  So, and he...  Then you shoot his head off, and it's blood spurting everywhere. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they get splurting blood.  It's a great game.  Yeah, I'm really enjoying the hell out of it.  Oh, and, uh...  Weapons are great.  I'm not sure if you guys have announced it, but October.  Place has already taken, uh, pre-orders for Grand Theft Auto 4.  Oh!  Yeah!  This October.  Can't wait.  Looking forward to that, Grand Theft Auto 3.  I'm a little scared, though.  I think the company's buckling under.  Do you?  I'm a little worried that they might go a little, uh, little PC with this version.  God, I hope not.  I don't have...  I don't have...  I swear I have no info, but I'm a little nervous about that situation. 
[00:18:00]  But if they try to outdo Grand Theft Auto 3, how much higher can you go?  I don't know.  Where can you go from there?  We'll have to wait and see.  All right, Dave, thanks.  Yeah, I'm going to punch out.  Cool.  That game's great.  I read something.  Some judge, um, one of the cities in this great nation, is, um, trying to legislate against  video games, and he didn't say Grand Theft Auto 3, but he was talking about games with  prostitution, carjacking, and mass murder. 
[00:18:30]  That would be Grand Theft Auto 3.  What could that be?  What game has prostitutes?  John, what's going on?  If it doesn't have child molesting, then you can just call it the Catholic Church.  Hey, John, go.  That's good.  Don't worry about concentrating on what's important.  Social Fortune 2, what they made was an engine called Ghoul 2.  Yes.  And basically, there's like 16 different, different areas, and eight alone in the head that you  can destroy.  Yeah.  So if you take out the pistol and shoot him in the eye, his eye blows off, but then you  just keep on working the face, and you can blow away half his face and see his brain 
[00:19:00]  hanging on his skull.  Yeah, I've taken out people's jaws, where you see their jaw just disappear from him,  and they're like, ah, poof, shotgun right to the midsection.  Oh, it's great.  And the other cool thing is, I don't know, but I get a little annoyed sometimes, and I  just play the game just to vent.  You take out the automatic shotgun and just keep shooting in the chest, and eventually  what happens is half their chest gets ripped off.  You see all their ribcaves and stuff?  Oh, it's amazing.  Isn't it great?  Yeah.  I love it.  Especially for a 15-year-old kid who wants to shoot at school, but that's another story. 
[00:19:30]  All right, John.  Thank you.  He wants to shoot.  Great.  Thanks.  You're going to really...  Good luck, son.  You're really going to help out the cause.  How are you going to shoot your classmates?  You just don't leave them as much.  Brian.  Another good scene.  I can't do anything right.  That guy was insane.  Brian.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, game on me.  Original play session one.  Siphon filter three.  You get to actually be in Afghanistan, and you get to shoot them solid. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah?  Siphon filter three.  Good game.  Yeah, but...  Not as good as a PlayStation 2, but hey...  Like Opie said, though, they've got to make the commitment to killing terrorists.  If you're going to have a game where they're killing terrorists, I want terrorists that I can relate to.  I want the nasty terrorists that I...  You know, it's a whole fantasy world, the games, and if you can pick up that gun and blast the terrorists,  I want them to be Middle Eastern terrorists.  All right.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right, Sean.  Listen, I had come up with a concept. 
[00:20:30]  It's a doctrine that I wrote.  It's titled The Declaration of Liberation for Diversified United Nations for the Edification and Purification of a Unilateral Society.  It's Jesse Jackson.  No, I wouldn't say that.  It's kind of a socialist concept.  I'll go over it as quick as I can.  It's a 10-year peace plan.  You take your money and you take your guns globally, your military.  You deduct it by 10% over a 10-year period.  After 10 years, you're going to read zero.  Once you read zero, it's kind of based on a biblical principle, so freely you give, so freely you receive, 
[00:21:00]  where everybody would have a six-hour day and shift to two.  And as you grow older, you work less days.  I think there's a good point, Anthony, to take a break.  All right.  It's the opening, Anthony, show.  By the way, if you're in New York City, 877-692-1027.  Yeah.  Outside of New York City, trying to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4WOW.  I've only come up with it by myself.  I really haven't gotten other people involved with me to help me out because it's kind of hard to do by myself.  On the way, Anthony, we're going to be talking more about Ted Williams. 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  His frozen head.  I think it would work.  Eddie Van Halen getting divorced.  Oh.  Boy George wants to F Eminem to hurt him.  Really distorts the reality of Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson, that freak.  Also, a couple want to try out for Sex for Sam.  Yes.  I mean, even with me and you.  I mean, if we get a DUI or we get in trouble just to come and work and guys.  What's the other thing?  Oh.  And when we get back, why don't we talk about David Hasselhoff?  David Hasselhoff having problems.  Yes.  It's not even a big deal.

You've got pressed dual-action whitening.  I was talking to somebody, then all of a sudden I was cut off.  I was just sharing an idea that I had.  Did you guys hear me?  Showtime is the home of TV's newest hit series. 
[00:28:00]  You were busted under the cap.  Somebody was talking back to me before.  They said, Sean, what's going on?  And I was talking to him.  And then next thing I know, I'm like, you with me?  And then nobody answered.  Tell me, what is going to make me think you're going to change now?  You don't think I know the consequences if I get arrested?  Well, if there was somebody there, to my knowledge, somebody said, Sean, what's going on?  What do you have to say?  And I started with a little meal.  And then halfway through it, I was like, are you with me?  You followed me?  And when I said you followed me, I didn't hear anybody respond.  Would you have in mind? 
[00:28:30]  Thought I'd take you to dinner.  Spend no more than 50 bucks, then weasel my way back to your place for a little thank you, thank you.  Great.  I'm trying to get out there to share some good ideas.  I do want you to spend the night.  In that case, let's just go off dinner so I can save some cash.  Perfect.  I don't like fooling around when I'm full anyway.  See you Saturday.  Now that isn't real refreshing?  Brought to you by the real refreshing taste of Lipton iced tea in a bottle.  Because Lipton is real, and real is refreshing.  Are you there?  1027.  You got a great show. 
[00:29:00]  W.E.W.  Okay, it's titled The Decoration of Liberation for Diversified United Nations  for the edification and purification of the unilateral society.  Follow me?  Take the good radio, guys.  Believe me.  After...  And welcome back to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Jesus.  Red Hot Chili Peppers, by the way. 
[00:29:30]  They're playing tonight on Ellis Island.  Chad, what's going on?  Hey, O.N.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, bro.  I have the mystery to why Mickey Mouse keeps showing up in Full Metal Jacket.  If you'll remember back when Full Metal Jacket was made,  obviously then and now Mickey Mouse is a big part of Walt Disney.  Well, I'm a Marine, and one thing they tell you in boot camp, 
[00:30:00]  the big cardinal knowledge of that is that Walt Disney was dishonorably discharged from the Marine Corps.  And he hates the Marine Corps, and so subliminally, he kind of just...  Subliminally.  He actually puts the Eagle Globe and anchor of the Marine Corps upside down  in a lot of his things at Walt Disney and a lot of other stuff.  So I think that was his way of getting Walt Disney back.  Probably.  How about that?  It's going a long way to get back at someone. 
[00:30:30]  No, that's a great one.  No?  Yeah, Walt Disney stinks.  All right, Chad, thank you.  Thanks, O.N.  The Marine Corps is a little more important than that stupid fag with four-fingered cartoon figures.  Hey, Sean.  Yeah.  You still there?  Yeah, I'm here.  Something happened with your phone, all right?  I don't know.  I was listening.  I was connected with you guys the whole time.  We didn't hear anything on this end, sir.  No.  Really?  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  Maybe the phone's a little screwy.  I haven't had any problems with it, though.  It says you have a wild idea on how to reach world peace, right?  Yes, I do. 
[00:31:00]  All right, can you hold on for a few minutes?  Sure.  All right, we'll get to you in a little bit, okay?  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Great.  Yeah, we'll talk to Sean a little bit about world peace, Anthony.  Sure.  He's been calling the show all day long, trying to get through with his theory.  Let's go to Ed first.  Hey, Ed, what's up?  Yo, ONA.  Hey.  Hey, I work for EB Game World.  I got some information on Grand Theft Auto IV, Vice City, and I got a game suggestion for  you, Anthony.  Yes.  Let me start with a game suggestion.  You like EverQuest, right? 
[00:31:30]  Well, I was playing that for a while until I got snubbed by my guild.  Well, I have a new game for you.  In December this month, or in December of 2002, a new Star Wars game is going to be coming  out called Galaxy.  I've heard of that.  It's like a Star Wars-based EverQuest.  That is correct.  That's going to blow.  So instead of being like a warrior and characters like that, you can be a Jedi.  Yeah.  Ed, stop kissing your boss's ass. 
[00:32:00]  You work for EB Game World.  That's the only reason you're going to shove that down our trots.  Dude, that game is going to be huge.  It's going to be huge.  But I got some information on Grand Theft Auto IV.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why is it going to be huge?  What's the name of you?  Because a lot of people that are playing EverQuest and got tired of it will check that  game out.  And if they're Star Wars geeks, they'll check that out.  It's the same basic addictive type of role-playing game.  Name one video game or computer game based on a movie that was successful.  They all blow.  They just throw them out there.  The last one, the last Star Wars Outkast that they just put out was great. 
[00:32:30]  It was a really great shooter.  They had a good lightsaber.  I don't hear a lot of people talking about the game.  Outkast.  Battlegrounds was an excellent game.  It was really good.  You know what really sucks?  Nakatomi Plaza.  It's based on the Die Hard movie.  Yeah.  Horrific.  You get like three weapons to choose from and you use the same machine gun through the  whole game.  Yeah.  Dude, you know what's a really good game?  Go out to a bar and meet a girl and get a Hummer.  That's a great game.  You only get one player, though, in that one. 
[00:33:00]  And if you die of the AIDS, you can't come back.  You get millions of men.  You just shoot them at the same time.  Who's to say Ed doesn't go out and get a trip?  Right.  I'm not talking about Ed.  I didn't say Ed.  You're talking about me?  There's other things to do in this world besides try to get sex 24 hours a day.  Mister, I haven't slept yet today.  Dude, look.  Please.  There are some really entertaining computer games out there that have nothing to do with just  stupid like fantasy things that you don't like.  You play up all night because you found a new computer game and you're excited about it  and yet you can't stop, so you play all night long. 
[00:33:30]  How about doing something a little different?  I laid in bed for two hours and 45 minutes and got back up.  No, I didn't have anything to do with video games.  I just couldn't.  See, you would probably enjoy a few of the games out there.  Get your mind off all the things.  You like strategy things?  Chess.  Maybe.  Well, something like, okay, how about, you would probably like Age of Empires.  No, I wouldn't.  All I want to do is play.  That's a cool game.  You get to build up your forces and build fortresses and then the attacking team has to  build at the same time.  And if you're built up, then you use catapults and archers and you send over armies and it's 
[00:34:00]  very strategic.  Can I wear a Burger King hat while I'm playing?  That's awful.  It's a great game.  I'd rather just play chess on the computer.  If I'm going to be on the computer, I'd rather just play chess and get my head beat.  There are games that take advantage of the technology that's out today and play a game  that you could have played back in 1972 on a computer.  Good.  Jim, there are games, though.  You know how you enjoy chess.  It's like a battle.  It's based on military, right? 
[00:34:30]  Dude.  And it's strategy.  There are plenty of computer games out there that are done very well, very smart, that  have the same basis.  You're looking at it like you're taking one part of chess and you're saying, well, it  could branch into this.  I mean, chess is black pieces and white pieces.  It doesn't mean I want to go out and get myself an interracial relationship.  But you could do that, too.  I would like that, actually, a little bit better.  All right.  Well, Ed, what do you got on GTA 4?  Well, GTA 4 is coming out November 12th.  Also, it's going to have a more expanded gameplay.  Instead of just running around the city with the larger city, you're also going to be able 
[00:35:00]  to enter buildings.  You're going to be able to kick in.  Oh, that's part of the game that was missing.  Yeah, exactly, Anthony.  I was kind of bummed about that in GTA 3, that you couldn't enter some of these buildings.  That's cool.  And Rockstar Games put out that lemon that was supposed to be, you're in a mall.  You know what, though, Ed?  State of Emergency.  State of Emergency.  We hated it.  State of Emergency.  It wasn't a bad game.  You know, Rockstar came to us with their new game, All Excited, and we can't fake it  on the air because people kind of are into what our opinions are on these games. 
[00:35:30]  And we didn't dig it.  But we got a lot of email.  People really liked that game.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, it didn't have the heat that GTA 3 did, but...  You know what it is?  Like he's saying, kicking open the doors and going into buildings.  That's the kind of thing that I thought the game was going to be all about, and it just  fell flat.  Now, if they could take the same thing like Grand Theft Auto 3 and make that, now you  can go into building.  Now you can just start, you know, tooling on people inside houses.  That's great.  Now you're talking.  Hey.  You're also going to be able to do things like go through and pillage different stores, 
[00:36:00]  and you're going to be able to run in and rob a store.  Looting, robbery, great.  Instead of just picking up a hooker, you're going to be able to force yourself if that's  legal.  Is there going to be rape in this game?  Yes, there is.  Yes.  Oh, God, no.  It's going to be the...  From what I'm reading, it's going to be the first adult-only game. 
[00:36:30]  They're not going to be able to sell it to anyone under the age of 18.  All right.  Cool.  Looking forward to it.  Yep.  Thank you.  Hey, Ed.  Yo.  Get us in the game.  Get you in the game?  Yeah.  Tell the bigwigs over there we want in on the game.  We were so close to being in GTA 3.  They called us up, and they got, I don't know, 10 or 20 hours of our radio show.  We were going to be one of the radio stations, but then they decided to go a whole different  way with the radios in the car.  That's the thing about the PC version of GTA 4. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  It's going to be available.  You're actually going to have interactive radio.  It's one of the options that they're investigating right now.  All right, Ed.  Thank you.  Yep.  See ya.  Bye.  Bye.  Sean wants to talk about World Peace.  Sean?  Yeah.  We're in a really good group about video games, so could you hold on a little bit longer?  Sure.  I'm a big video game junkie myself.  Take it.  There you go.  Oh, really?  Yeah, big time.  You know, I got some good ideas.  Um, yes? 
[00:37:30]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Andrew from Boston.  What's going on?  Yeah, um, I have this phone call for, uh, Mr. Norton.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  Um, I'd like to find out, uh, what happened to you over the weekend, the Fourth of July,  something about it not being gay, uh, thinking about Opie and costing you $225?  Yeah, what's wrong with you guys?  You were supposed to remind us of this at 3 o'clock today.  Remember that?  We got to that at, like, uh, $650.  $50?  Yesterday.  Yesterday, and, uh, it was something about Jimmy paying a lot of money, having some kind 
[00:38:00]  of sexual encounter, and at the moment of truth, right there where he gets what he paid  for, uh, something happened where Opie popped in your mind.  But you said it wasn't gay.  Right.  I am so sure.  All right, thank you for reminding us, Andrew.  You're welcome.  We've got to give you something for this.  Okay.  Hold on the line, okay, Andrew?  Will do.  You guys were supposed to remind us of this at 3 o'clock.  Yeah, what an easy practice.  I am a meaty disgrace.  I forgot.  I'm pregnant.  He has been just down on himself all day. 
[00:38:30]  We saw Jim Norton in the back office.  Um, dude, I'm awful.  You got a belly now.  You quit smoking seven months ago.  I wouldn't call you fat by any means.  He was flouched in his chair.  You just got, you just got a belly though, a little, you don't drink, but it looks kind  of like a beer belly.  This is honest to God true.  I couldn't sleep at all.  I laid in bed for almost three hours and got up disgusted and thought of throwing myself  out the window.  I was so annoyed that I couldn't sleep and I'm not being, I was honest to God in the mirror 
[00:39:00]  without his shirt singing, you fat, lazy pig, just looking at my body.  You fat, lazy pig.  You're just singing that.  But I wasn't kidding.  I was alone and I was just.  Were you singing like Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin?  You fat, lazy pig.  Looking back, it was silly, but I was singing it and looking at myself in my, I have a nice  bathroom mirror.  Look at it.  Look at me.  Were you nude?  Were you nude?  You looked like one of our contestants in the wow contest.  Oh God. 
[00:39:30]  Um, was I nude?  Yes, the contestant for a prize.  I probably was, but the mirror is only come up to my mid-track belt.  You can't see below the up and back of me scar.  I'm not talking about what you could see.  I'm just talking about the camera shot from the back, what that must have looked like.  Reprehensible.  We saw Jim in the back office.  He was so bummed he pulled his shirt up a little bit.  Yeah.  We saw him take his index finger and go two knuckles deep into his own belly button.  Dude, you don't understand.  I should be gutted.  I can't stop eating. 
[00:40:00]  Is it the eating?  You eat a lot?  It's just the laziness.  Yeah.  It's the inept, I'm not good at living life at all, dude.  I am so bad.  The only real activity you get is running from club to club doing your act every night.  And walking here.  And walking here.  And the last night before coming back from 4th of July break, paying a woman $225.  You know, I just can't go to dominatrices.  It's just not much.  Because I'm not into anything they do.  I don't want to be whipped and spanked. 
[00:40:30]  No, no.  I hate dominatrix.  I do not like that whole head that they have.  That whole, we're empowered and we're...  Shut up.  Lay down.  It just seems...  I don't mind if it's sincere, but it just seems so insincere.  And it's...  Oh, you can tell they're acting.  So it's such a margy.  Why did you pay for one, Jimmy?  I'll tell you.  Because I'm stupid.  That's that simple.  You're one of these guys...  Let me just tell you this now.  Maybe I'm wrong.  No, you're not.  You're now looking for another sexual thrill. 
[00:41:00]  You're so...  I think you might be getting not bored, because it's enjoyable,  but you're looking for just something a little different.  Am I right here?  No, because I'm not bored with...  I like straight sex, you know.  I just figured, let me...  I don't know why I did.  Why did you call a dominatrix?  Oh, no.  Because I got...  You know, sometimes you get a little bee in your body.  I don't like when they friggin' come in here and pull that act.  I wouldn't mind it if it would be real, but just, you know... 
[00:41:30]  Look, all I want is a little face sitting and some yellow discipline.  That's it.  Save the rest of the stupid talk for some 50-year-old fat guy.  I'm not interested.  You can't get that from just a call girl or something?  No, I don't.  She won't do it for you?  No, and this was just an awful session.  The girl was cool, though, but I'm just not into it.  All right, so you're doing the session with this.  Kiss my feet.  Oh, shut up.  I hate that.  When they come in here and they got the whip, say yes, mistress.  Just shut up.  Shut your face.  Just shut up.  That day Opie made one of them cry, I was dying. 
[00:42:00]  I was laughing my ass off.  One of my biggest accomplishments, by the way.  Some of them are cool, but the ones I've gone to for sessions, I've only been a couple,  have been awful.  This slob comes in with her dominatrix girlfriend, and they're pulling that whole goddamn act where,  kiss my feet, I am your mistress, and there's other guys in the studio.  Can we get that tape?  I hope so.  I was really, really drunk.  I was running a fez, right?  I was really drunk that night.  And then...  It was the dominatrix that looked like Joey Ramone.  Right, and that's what got her crying. 
[00:42:30]  Opie turns to her and goes, hey, why don't you shut up, Joey Ramone?  And who knew?  All of a sudden, that big, tough dominatrix put on fell to the floor, and she just starts  weeping and left the studio crying.  Bye-bye, dominatrix.  I ruined their whole show, because they had all this stuff planned, and one stupid comment,  and all of a sudden, they have to make up an hour of radio.  Oh, it was great.  Yeah.  And I'm not saying, dude, a lot...  If it's real, there's a real vibe to it, and somebody's really dominant, that can be 
[00:43:00]  really sexy.  I guess if you're into it.  No, but it's got to be real.  I hate shtick.  Yeah.  Like, you know, oh, you've been a bad boy, haven't you?  Did I ever tell you about the time?  I'll give off this story.  I went to an escort.  She only did hand fun.  Right.  And an awful back rub, and I swear to God, she was probably 55.  How much does that run?  50 bucks.  Oh.  She was brutal, and she was rubbing me down, and she was trying to talk sexy.  Yeah.  And I swear, she was telling me about a time she met Ronald Reagan, and I... 
[00:43:30]  This is true.  And she gives my backside a little spank, and she goes, oh, you've been a bad boy.  And it was just like, Jesus, can you try to...  She did that to Reagan?  Can you try to...  He has spanked me more.  She slapped James Brady, and he just fell.  I want a happy ending.  It's about time I shoot somebody else.  You know what?  I'm with you on this one.  I tried it.  I didn't realize what a little bad she would be. 
[00:44:00]  If it's based on reality, you could go with a little bit.  But if you know they're faking, yeah.  She was terrible.  It takes you right out of it.  And then, anyway...  I'm with you, Jim.  I'm with you.  I couldn't even finish.  So, she was just like...  It was like grabbing a wet noodle, and I just...  I'm like, you know what?  I gotta go.  Anyway, this one, the other night...  I was trying to hold on to a slippery piece of rope.  Yeah, it was almost like my mule kept ducking and going, catch me if you can.  The slimy rope you're supposed to tie to the dock.  The boat rope.  It's all full of algae.  Whoop, whoop.  I just can't get a grip on her. 
[00:44:30]  So, go ahead.  Go back to the dominatrix where my stupid name pops in your head.  My face pops in your head.  I've been depressed lately, and you know, you do things to pull yourself out,  and sometimes you're paying someone to give you yellow discipline.  And this costs how much?  $225.  So, for $220.  Now, how do you get this girl?  No details.  I mean, just how do you...  Yeah, of course.  We chat on the net.  We talk on the phone.  Oh, the internet.  Yeah.  So...  Is there a site where you can go to to just get, like...  Oh, there's a bunch of them, yeah.  Like, hookers?  Well, yeah.  They're not hookers. 
[00:45:00]  She's not a hooker.  She wasn't...  Dude, dude.  Stop it.  No, no, I will...  Stop it.  You paid her.  She's a hooker.  You paid her to do things to you sexually.  Yeah, yeah, I guess...  That's a hooker.  Yeah, but not a good one, because you can't...  It might be a part-time job, Ant.  That's it.  Will you admit she's a part-time hooker?  Oh, dude, I have no problem admitting hookers.  I just thought I was doing great with you.  It's just...  Oh, I thought I was doing great with you.  You're a hooker!  With panties on.  Yeah.  Oh, is that it?  Ugh! 
[00:45:30]  And then the yellow discipline comes.  I'm just like, let's just get this over with so I can finish and get out of here.  Really?  Yeah, there's not even a shower facility.  I'm just going to have to towel off.  Oh, no!  You told her right from the get-go here that you want yellow discipline.  Yeah, let's please not say get-go.  I just can't have this story with get-go in there.  Right from the giddy-up.  Yeah.  And she had a lot of spunk and pizzazz.  She was a real go-getter this gal.  So after she gets there and she knows what... 
[00:46:00]  We met and went to a location.  A location.  Yeah, it's a dungeon.  Which I'm not entirely...  Wait, wait, wait.  You went to a dungeon?  Yeah, but I didn't...  This is where they take...  This story's getting better.  I'll tell you, there's different rooms.  I didn't go into any of the rooms.  There's a medical room where they do, like, I guess, whatever medical stuff.  There's probably, like, the, what, they got anima?  I don't know.  I ran through...  That's the medical one.  I had to use the laboratory facility.  So I ran through.  It happened to be through the medical room, as it should be in any good dungeon. 
[00:46:30]  But I didn't even want to know.  Did they have the biker garage room?  I didn't look around, dude.  I didn't want to know.  I'm telling you, 90% of what they do there, I mean, good for them.  It's just so far...  I wish it got...  I wish I enjoyed it.  Yeah.  It's just so far out there.  It's like the one with a mummified...  Stop!  Just, you know, come on.  I mean, I really...  I'm like vanilla in that place.  Right.  That's all he wants is a little salty loveliness.  Rack!  Must be religious.  So what dungeon were you in? 
[00:47:00]  What was the decor?  No, it was a very plain room.  It had a bunch of...  It was just...  It was awful.  Come on.  It had a bunch of...  I'll tell you.  Did it have a rack?  No, it didn't have any of that because I didn't want any of that.  She knew it.  It had a closet full of women's clothes and a bunch of shoes in case you were into feminization.  Oh, they take you to that room.  Transformations.  And she would then dress you...  Gussie a guy up like...  It's called transformation?  Like a woman.  Yeah.  Which does nothing for me.  The idea of someone...  Transformers!  Homos in disguise!  There you go.  So, we're doing this session. 
[00:47:30]  I'm kissing the...  It's just awful.  There was no real sexual contact, believe it or not.  What did she look like?  She had brown hair and just a head.  How old?  26, 25.  All right.  You're right.  This is meaningless.  Okay.  It's meaningless.  I know.  She was meaningless.  Oh, okay.  But I'm laying back and when it's time...  They have to keep the room clean.  This is just when you reevaluate your life and say, are you going to lay down a pad to  give the discipline?  Oh.  And so, you know, dude, and she lays down this thing.  It looks like a Huggies. 
[00:48:00]  I'm a 33-year-old man.  Was it like a disposable diaper-type pad?  It was a blanket.  It looks like a diaper.  Oh, no.  I'm a 33-year-old man with a belly laying back on a diaper waiting for a stranger to somehow  fill this vacuum.  I don't know where this void came from.  Fill this void.  It's $225 of my hard-earned dollars in her slut sea purse.  Oh, my goodness.  This is horrible.  What did my face pop into this situation? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  How does now...  You're in the dungeon.  You're laying down.  I've been whacking.  All right.  I've been trying to get myself prepared.  All right.  Yeah, be careful.  You're getting yourself well prepared.  And let's just say I was packing nowhere near full.  Right.  Just because the whole shtick was bugging me.  You know?  Yeah.  And that person had a different stroke.  She was doing the same thing for me.  So I lay back, and finally, the yellow discipline starts.  And, of course, you know, I just...  I forgot she was spitting on me, too. 
[00:49:00]  No, stop it.  Yeah, I tried that.  Not my face, though.  That's, you know, the old...  She was spitting on...  Okay, so she's...  Without getting into any details, she's positioned where she's facing your feet.  Yeah.  Okay.  Of course, she was spitting on my chest and my mule.  So she's spitting on your mule and whatnot and administering the discipline.  Well, then she started administering discipline, and I'm like, in the face.  So I got...  You told her in the face?  Yeah, and do it.  And do it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Although, I will say, I didn't swallow anything.  All right.  I don't do that.  Well, good.  But I got some in the mouth, and my eyes, as soon as, you know, it hits...  Glad to know you know where your edge is.  Yeah, you got a...  Your line.  And I close my eyes.  You close your eyes.  And I don't...  God almighty, keg lady.  I mean, it was endless.  Really?  I was waiting for a guy in a barrel to shoot out.  Like a mare.  When you stop.  And as I'm finishing, and I mean, I'm really finishing.  Oh, so you're now... 
[00:50:00]  This got you so much that you're ready to be done.  Oh, dude.  I should have been standing outside a college in 1962, stopping certain admissions.  I...  Give everybody a second for that one.  No, I got it right away.  Oh, you did, yes.  As I'm finishing, in the middle of it, I swear to God, his dumb face pops into my head, and  he says, you got serious problems.  Oh.  I didn't...  So you see Opie saying, you got serious problems. 
[00:50:30]  You got serious problems.  Because I was...  All disgusted at you and everything?  I was...  I don't know.  I didn't stop and ask for the inflection.  I was too busy ruining $225.  Thinking of his blonde locks scolding me.  Surprised you weren't there doing Tyson, and Ben could have been there drunk.  Maybe Sting could have been there, tussling his hair.  Had the whole crew watching.  I know where that comes from, because I abuse you.  No, it was because...  Oh, my God.  It wasn't...  No, no, it wasn't...  It was...  It wasn't an abusive thing. 
[00:51:00]  It was right.  Well, I'm a friend of yours.  We talk, and...  No, no.  But there are times I'm just not a good friend.  I'll just point at his fatness.  Yeah, he really will.  And just start laughing.  And we'll be with his girlfriend, and he'll say, like, dude, show her your stomach.  Oh, God.  Why do you do that?  I don't mind, because she's his girlfriend, but it's like, it's a woman.  She's still...  I don't want a woman seeing it.  Yeah.  Even though it's not a woman that...  You know, it's my friend's girlfriend.  But it makes me happy.  I know.  I know.  A lot of things make me happy that I can't have. 
[00:51:30]  Tuttle from New York saying...  Harley Incorporation.  Norton's description of his life makes me want to slip my wrists.  Dude, I'm not feeling sorry for myself.  You know, whatever.  I'm not saying everybody should feel sorry.  You know, it's all self-perception.  That's what all life is, the way you see things.  Oh, God.  I'm mad at saying what you laid on was called a puppy pad.  They give them away at the pet shops when you get a new puppy to housebreak.  And you put them in a vestibule.  I'm glad I didn't know that, because I'm sure that the guy with the bad mustache would 
[00:52:00]  have popped in my head and sang that Petland Discount theme song right here.  And you get...  They used to say, with every puppy you adopt, get free wee-wee pads.  They were called wee-wee pads.  You were laying on a wee-wee pad.  On a wee-wee pad.  How about, with every meaty comic with an appendectomy scar, get a free wee-wee pad.  Oh.  Disgrace.  You got serious problems.  I'm sorry.  No, man.  What is this?  Jim, stop crying.  The best two nights of my life was servicing you in New York City. 
[00:52:30]  And when you say go, I'll do it again.  I have more pics for you.  I'll send now.  I won't say the name or anything, but it's...  You know this?  You know that person?  You're smiling.  Yeah?  He's looking.  Oh, yeah.  He goes, mm-hmm.  Look.  You're smiling again.  Yeah.  There's the gym we know.  All happy again.  Look at you.  All's good with the world.  I'm bad.  I've been...  First commercial break, he's going to be... 
[00:53:00]  What was that email address?  Let me...  Nah, I don't even care, dude.  I'm so obsessed.  Yeah?  Well, that's a good...  Oh, he's pinching his fat.  That's a good story.  Wow.  It's true, too.  All right.  We've got to get to Sean.  Jeez.  Sean has a wild idea on how to reach world peace.  Sean?  Yeah.  Oh, uh...  Oh, dude, we got to...  I wanted to ask her.  You there?  Yeah, hold on, dude.  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, Sean, Ben's saying we have to take a break because it's 3.55.  Okay.  Can you wait through the commercials?  Sure.  Call there.  All right, because we don't have anything planned for after the commercials, so we'll talk to Sean 
[00:53:30]  and his idea about world peace.  You haven't been waiting too long, right?  Me?  Well, I don't know, 15 minutes.  Not a big deal.  For world peace, it's worth it, though.  All right.  Hold on, Sean.  Yeah.  Please don't go anywhere.  No, I'm not.  You've got a good outlook.  You're going to be the showstopper today.  You're going to get a lot of calls for this.  I promise you that.  All right.  Oh, I know we will.  You watch.  All right, hold on, Sean.  All right.  All right, we'll get to Sean.  He's got some good stuff to tell us today, right, Ant?  Yes.  Ted Williams' bit just about done?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:54:00]  Got to talk about Ted Williams and his head in a little bit.  His frozenness.  It's getting better.  Yeah.  And also, you know, we've got to do the Hasselhoff thing, too.  David Hasselhoff.  A little bit of problems there.  You know what?  There's a great story that kind of relates to the Norton thing a little bit.  A guy that's got some problems.  Really the guy that put on probably the biggest show in the world.  And, yeah, comic.  Yeah.  Let's see how we tie in together.  He starred in Baywatch, and I paid $225 for a five to discipline me. 
[00:54:30]  You're still effed up, both of you, isn't it?  All right, Ant, we've got another Sergeant Hartman prank call as we go to break.  Christian Castleman, this is Darrell.  What's your name, fat buddy?  Who's this?  Gober Pyle.  Gober Pyle.  Do you like that name?  It's a wonderful name.  Do you think I'm cute?  Do you think I'm funny?  Yeah.  Are you all about to call me an ass?  She says, I am.  I thought I'd never hear from Gober Pyle. 
[00:55:00]  What have we got here?  Comedian.  Hey, what's your language?  You're on the national airwaves here.  Do you suck?  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I just want to be with a man who will ignore me and take me for granted, and he's only pretending  to be interested in who I am and what I think so he can get into my channel.  Dirty girls in love with you.  Opie.  And you know where a guy can get a rub and a tug around you?  Anthony.  M-N-D-W.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:55:30]  Good show today, man.  We're going to talk about Ted Williams' head again today.  David Hasselhoff's in the news.  I would think we'd even have to talk about Ted Williams' head.  Man.  I told you that son of his was a sick F.  Poor guy.  Can we just play the quote of Ted's daughter there?  Do you have it, or do I have that one? 
[00:56:00]  Where's Rick?  No, we don't have that?  Okay.  Damn.  I will bet you money it's not the one I want to hear right now.  I know.  I wanted to have it on this.  All right, play it.  Here's Ted Williams' daughter.  And it's A, not B.  Holy S.  Do you have it, Ant?  I think so.  Do I have to go that back?  All right, turn the music off.  Let's go.  This is a professional radio show. 
[00:56:30]  You got it, Ant?  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Timing's everything in comedy, though.  Why do we have to wait 40 seconds to try to figure out where the clip was?  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Ah, God damn.  And can you play the other one? 
[00:57:00]  I mean, we'll put it all together later.  Um.  The Arnold.  I don't think I have that one.  Oh, you don't have that one?  That one, I don't have.  Now, where's that one?  See, this is the problem when we prepare for a radio show.  Our stuff is spread out everywhere.  But then we don't know if we have it or don't.  Is it on that machine?  Is it on your machine?  Or is it on this machine?  I don't know.  Oh.  Hello.  All right, why don't we get to Sean Anthony?  Sean's been on hold for a little while now.  He has this wild idea on how to reach world peace. 
[00:57:30]  And I think a lot of people would like to hear his idea because, you know, we're a little scared these days.  Right, Ant?  You never know what's going to work.  Sean.  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on, bro?  What's going on, Cuddy?  Oh, damn.  This thing.  I'm sorry, Sean.  We've got to get to this Ann Landers thing real quick.  It'll be two seconds.  And how much time are you guys going to give me?  Huh?  How much time do I got?  Because I can entertain you guys for a while.  If you have a little patience, we'll give you like 20 minutes.  But you know what?  Ant's right.  If we put you on the air now, we only have about five minutes in this segment. 
[00:58:00]  And this is quick.  I'll take the 20 minutes.  You sure?  Yeah, because I've also been going through a lawsuit, and these cops are hiding evidence from me.  I can't even get...  I don't know if you guys know what a dictaphone is.  Oh, yeah.  But I can't even get the dictaphone.  I swear to God, I didn't go to court yet, and they erased...  I have it in writing.  Sean, Sean.  Yeah.  Help us out.  Just hang in there a little longer, okay?  All right.  All right, Sean, we'll be talking about dictaphones and world peace in a little while.  Stick around for that.  That should be intriguing.  Is Ann Landers dead?  Yeah, the daughter has taken over. 
[00:58:30]  Now, the daughter has taken her over.  You ready for this?  Yeah.  I saw the daughter on Larry King, I think it was last week.  Mm-hmm.  She's been writing the column since 1988.  88.  It's kind of like that band theory thing.  And you know what?  Ann Landers wasn't the first Ann Landers, Anthony.  No.  There was another Ann Landers before the Ann Landers.  Stop it.  And Ann Landers took over the name.  This picture is Ann Landers.  Yeah, that's the mom who stopped writing the column in 1988. 
[00:59:00]  Some of the papers show the picture of the daughter, finally.  Now, but I know her sister, Ann Landers' sister, Dear Abby.  Right.  Ugh.  She's got the daughter that is doing her column.  Oh, wait.  She's still alive.  Wait.  But she's retired.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  So that's the daughter.  But Ann Landers is dead.  Wait.  Ann Landers is dead.  Ann Landers is dead.  And everything I just said pertains to Dear Abby.  How can you tell them apart?  I know.  They're sisters.  And it's the same drivel.  Just busybody. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, busy, nosy body.  So you're right.  Ann Landers, this was in today's paper, is dead.  And the column goes on.  But who writes Ann Landers' column?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  All right.  Sorry.  But they still put her picture in there and everything.  It's kind of like the band thing.  You know what?  Oh, that's another tangent.  Remember our band theory?  We won't get back to Sean if we get off on a tear.  And she never gives good advice.  No.  No, no.  It's awful old lady advice.  Although there is a certain...  If you look at the real old ones that Ann Landers wrote the answers to 
[01:00:00]  and look at the newer ones, you can tell there's somebody a little more liberal in there now.  Hold on.  I'm going to defend either Ann Landers or Dear Abby.  I don't know which...  Whatever.  I know.  How about hints from Heloise?  Helpful hints from Heloise.  Dear Beth.  One of them thought it was okay to have naked teen parties.  Naked teen slumber parties.  That's right.  Remember?  A woman called...  Yeah.  That's not old lady advice. 
[01:00:30]  No.  No.  No.  Ann Landers would have been like, no, absolutely not.  That was Michael Jackson's column.  Dear Jacko.  Dear Wacko Jacko.  What did Fox have on him today with the Wacko Jacko?  God, I can't remember.  The headlines are great with Michael Jackson.  Whenever they put anything before Jacko that rhymes with Jacko, I'm entertained for hours.  The best headline on Fox today...  God, we're all over the place today.  Yeah, no big.  They're talking about the Ted Williams head? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  And they go, will it be fire or ice for Ted Williams and his head?  Who came up with that one, Psycho Mark?  Because, you know, Ted wanted to be cremated.  I know.  So that would be the fire part.  John Henry wants to freeze the damn head.  And by the way, Michael Jackson...  Can I have the clip of the daughter again?  Of course.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head. 
[01:01:30]  There's our next sound effect that will run into the ground for you.  Of course we will.  All the faithful listeners rolling their eyes.  Oh, great.  Sorry, Ann, I only have more.  Yeah, another member of Ted Williams' family.  Oh, you do.  You got that.  Speaking of the situation...  Not a good time to lose one's head.  Indeed.  That's not the way to get a head in life.  No.  It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.  He'll never be the head of a major corporation.  Absolutely not. 
[01:02:00]  Sorry, Ann, that audio just came in from the family.  Of course it did from the family.  Yeah, but more audio of the family.  Crikey!  I've lost my mojo!  Watch out.  Oh, here's the guy that's going to do the job and freeze Ted's head, Anthony.  I don't want to see that. 
[01:02:30]  Sounded like Arnold a little.  Yeah, I know.  This is as they wheel Ted into the chamber there.  To freeze his head, Ann.  To freeze his head.  Welcome home to our space.  Allow me to break the ice.  My name is freeze.  Learn it well.  For it's the killing sound of your doom.  Wow, Ted sounds a little angry.  Being frozen and all.  You know, can we get back to the Ann Landers?  Ann Landers. 
[01:03:00]  But you've got to play Arnold singing, forcing everyone to sing, I'm Mr. Freeze.  Oh, you mean Ted Williams singing?  Yes, yes.  Ted Williams singing.  Oh, yeah, Ted.  Ted.  I'm Mr. White Christmas.  I'm Mr. Snow.  I'm Mr. Icicle.  I'm Mr. Tender.  Sing, sing!  I call me Snow Lizer.  Whatever I touch 
[01:03:30]  turns the snow into crotch.  Come on, sing!  Louder, come on, sing, sing, sing!  Come on!  Yes, come on, Louder!  Another tangent.  He has the same lines in every movie.  I mentioned that.  That sounds just like the, come on, do it, do it now!  When we were watching Collateral Damage in the hotel room, I said that.  I go, you know something? 
[01:04:00]  He has the same goddamn line in every movie.  Come on!  Come on!  He's always saying, come on!  Go to the chopper!  Come on!  Come on!  Here, listen to this.  Come on.  Come on.  Do it!  Do it!  Come on!  Come on!  Kill me!  I'm here!  Kill me!  I'm here!  Kill me!  Come on!  Kill me!  I'm here!  Oh, this is Norton from the other night with the 200-0-4-0. 
[01:04:30]  Oh.  Oh, that was Jimmy Norton with the hooker.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I played the wrong clip.  Kill me.  All right.  Let me go to Mike here.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Yeah, maybe Ann Landers' daughter wants the option, Ann Landers' head.  Yeah, freezer, freezer big head.  Oh.  With that hairdo.  That, you know, 1963 hairdo.  You know, family advice from Ann Landers' head.  That's a beautiful move, son.  Thank you, Mikey.  Okay, back to Ann Landers. 
[01:05:00]  Ann Landers.  Well, a nudist family can't include aunt in the fun.  That's what the headline is.  Dear Ann Landers, my 63-year-old widowed aunt lives alone and has few friends.  We've always been close, and last summer I invited her to spend two weeks with my family.  I even paid for her airline ticket.  She was a perfectly lovely house guest.  And my teenage girls adored getting to know their great aunt better. 
[01:05:30]  Here's the problem.  We have a backyard swimming pool, and the entire family often sunbathes in the nude.  My aunt, in an effort to fit in, decided she would get an all-over tan along with the rest of us.  That could be the best sound we ever found.  I admired her willingness to show her body in front of the family. 
[01:06:00]  Her informal poolside attire didn't bother me, but apparently it was a problem for my husband and 12-year-old son.  Oh, dear.  They did not want to see my aunt walking around without her clothing and asked me to make sure it didn't happen again.  Well, my daughters have invited my aunt for another visit. 
[01:06:30]  My husband insists I tell her to wear a swimsuit this time.  I'm certain it would hurt her feelings if I made her dress while the rest of us skinny-dipped.  But my aunt was thrilled to be treated like a member of the family, and I don't want to make her feel less welcome.  Should I do what my husband asks, or should I tell him to turn his head and look the other way?  From Malibu, California.  Did she respond that the whole family should get into a car and put a hose in the window and park it in the garage? 
[01:07:00]  Dear Malibu, apparently your husband is not an equal opportunity nudist.  I do not believe it is wise to have your teenage daughters running around nude in front of their father and adolescent brother.  This time around, everyone should wear a swimsuit, period.  See, there you go.  That's the old Ann Lander's answer to that.  This family, 12-year-old son, two teen daughters, and the husband and wife just lounging around naked going swimming. 
[01:07:30]  Well, nudists do that, though.  But then...  They get naked with their kids all the time.  Whether it's at the beach or...  Do they have the nudist colonies anymore?  I don't even know.  The only pictures I've seen are the old big Earth Mama Muffs.  Those are great.  What happened to the nudist colonies?  Where they're playing volleyball, big fat guys with a schlong slapping around.  And the 70s Earth Mama Muffs on all the old hags. 
[01:08:00]  Got the kids in the sandbox.  They're doing their thing naked as mom and dad are playing a game of volleyball.  The only thing worth seeing was the fact that you might see that 18-year-old daughter at the pool.  There's something in those pictures.  But for the most part, it's just...  Ugh.  So, yeah.  There it is.  Two teenage girls.  The 12-year-old son.  The father.  The mother.  And...  The naked 63-year-old widowed aunt. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, God.  Awful.  I think now Ann Landers, or whoever's writing for Ann, is either getting scammed or they are now writing, like, fake stories to try to get it a little more titillating, right?  Well, it was a known fact that fraternities would try to get their letters printed. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, is that a wacky fraternity thing?  Well, no, it came up in an interview with one of these sisters, and they said, ah, even though we know it might be a fake letter, it could pertain to someone out there.  Hey, I'm going to write my own letters.  I'm Ann Landers.  I think they're faking it to be a little titillating.  Or, yeah, they're just getting scammed because this is right on the heels of that nude slumber party the girls wanted to have.  The teen.  The teen nude slumber party, we're talking 14-year-old girls that wanted to get together and have a nude slumber party. 
[01:09:30]  Boy, if that isn't appropriate there.  And who put the kibosh on that?  No one.  No one, Ann, or where Abby there said it was an okay idea.  It's okay, just make sure there's no guys there.  And the husband and the son were going away on a fishing trip.  And she said it was okay that they, as long as they're supervised. 
[01:10:00]  But the idiot doesn't realize that the girls that age will have cameras and take some pictures and they end up on the Internet.  And Jim's downloading them and we are and, well, you know, there's a meeting with Ken Stevens.  Andrew.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, there's a nudist colony in Jersey.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, like in Central Jersey.  I saw it advertised in a regular paper.  And what do they do?  They play volleyball and have a picnic and... 
[01:10:30]  It's expensive.  It's like $350 just to join.  It's probably Newark when they just steal your clothes.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, could you put me on hold for about three hours?  Thanks.  All right.  Thank you, Andrew.  Nudist colony in Jersey.  Is that what it runs you?  $300 and so on.  But you see, you could have saved a few more pennies.  Here's a guy.  Yeah, they make it look glamorous until the mom gets up and you see a slug trail on the picnic bench.  They're all slobs.  Mom, put the bench down.  Oh, Brian.  Yeah.  Hey, bro.  Guys, I just got a surprise of a lifetime when my 60-year-old father-in-law came home and told us he joined a nudist colony down in Florida. 
[01:11:00]  That was my reaction, too.  How are you going to feel when he gets a melanoma on his helmet?  I just hope he doesn't try to show it to me.  Guys, it's awful.  He got a newsletter, and like you guys were saying, there's nobody attractive there.  I opened up this newsletter, and I was absolutely appalled.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  Later, bro.  Bye.  I'm into nudist sites on the Internet.  You're going through, and it's all fat old guys, fat old women, lounging around with just a big, nasty muff. 
[01:11:30]  Ugh.  Who wants to go to that?  I agree.  For the occasional scene that you're going to see maybe one of their hot daughters running around or something.  A hot chick running around.  Hey, Judge from Hoboken, going back to the Jacko thing.  Yeah.  When Michael Jackson fell in New York a few years ago, the post headline was, Jacko on his back-o. 
[01:12:00]  Jacko likes young boys crack-o.  Uh-oh.  He does.  I smell bad.  Oh, yeah.  The wheels are turning.  Oh, no.  They're turning.  Shoo.  Shoo.  Shoo.  Shoo.  All right.  Shoo.  Oh, Jacko stuff.  There's not many words that rhyme with that.  Jacko.  Who came up with that?  The post?  Was it the post?  No, it was one of the tabloids.  Oh, like the Star and Quire or something? 
[01:12:30]  What, the new one?  Jacko.  I'm calling it.  He looks like one of the bud frogs.  He really is awful.  Oh, he's gone.  Yeah.  Mr. Payne.  Oh, hey.  Yes, Mr. Payne.  Jesus Christ, I've been trying to get on since you've been in D.C.  How the hell are you?  I'm doing all right.  Hey, I don't know if the story's true.  But I hear Rich Voss is freezing his jokes so he can reuse them in 20 years.  He's not even here.  Hey, I got something for Norton.  Oh, Jim likes yellow discipline.  Oh, very good.  I'm killing myself. 
[01:13:00]  Bye.  I forgot about that.  It does suck.  No, that was all right.  Yeah.  We can handle that.  All right.  Hey.  Sean?  Hey, I got a quick joke for you guys.  You know how it's time to go to bed at Michael Jackson's house?  Ah.  When the big hand touches the little hand.  Oh.  It's actually not bad.  I actually, I got something I wanted to bring to the table.  Oh.  Oh.  Sean, can you hold on?  Sure.  This is real.  This is worth it.  It's a...  Seriously?  Yes.  Sean, hold on, all right?  Sure.  I'm not goofing.  I'm not messing with Sean.  I'll take the phones and world peace with you, right?  Take the phone and declarations. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Okay.  Hold on, bro.  Sure.  Coach East, Jacko don't like the tuna taco.  Wow, that was nice.  You know, that was one of those things, it was a stretch, but it worked.  Yeah.  He was stretching, but it...  He stretched it, but it worked.  I liked it.  It didn't stretch too far.  I liked it.  All right.  Yes, Jim.  I just thought something interesting was that, you know, like there's a lot of interns that 
[01:14:00]  come through.  Yeah.  On the ONA show, most of them are very, very cool.  And I've talked a lot to one of the girls we have here, Francine, and she's actually  really nice.  And she gave me these jokes she wrote, but it was like not really in joke form, it was  more in paragraph form.  Right.  And I looked at it, and I actually don't know what I did with it, and then she put it on  a CD.  I saw her outside the studio, and she's like, she actually came in to learn the board and  put it on the CD, but there's no audience there.  So I thought it would be interesting to listen to something. 
[01:14:30]  Like as a comic?  Yeah.  You being a comic.  It's hard.  I think she's actually pretty funny.  It's just hard to do without an audience, though, because you feel like, you know, you're  just, you're speaking.  Mm-hmm.  And everyone has done that in the mirror or whatever, but it's like, it's rare you get  it.  Well, why don't we bring her in here, and...  All right.  Let's see what this is all about.  All right.  While we get her in here, Orlando.  What's up, y'all?  Even Jacko knows Rich Boss is a hacko.  Thank you, Wolf.  God damn.  That's a good one. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, God.  That's good.  Jacko.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here's...  Hold on.  Dennis, go ahead.  Dennis.  Hey, gentlemen.  What's that?  An old post headline from the Pepsi fire, Jacko Lantern.  Really?  Wow.  That's true.  Okay.  Thank you, bro.  Hold on.  I'm getting rid of everybody.  If I'm hanging up on you, don't take it personally.  Okay.  Francine, what's this tape you made? 
[01:15:30]  Filthy Dave from Jersey.  Very good.  Jacko splooched his mule juice all over Macaulay Culkin's back.  That is Bill from Virginia.  God damn.  Chris the cop, Jacko does the fudge pack-o.  After he got done...  Wait, wait.  After...  I stink!  We gave you some time, too. 
[01:16:00]  Come on.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  Something...  Come on.  You can do it.  After he left Voss' house...  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I can't do it.  Oh!  I can't do it.  Oh, we're all getting uncomfortable.  Just...  Oh, look.  I couldn't word it.  Oh, the headline on Fox News was Jacko's Attack-o.  Because he attacked Sony Music.  Yeah.  Jacko's Attack.  Or after he sucked...  Yeah, you know what?  I should just lay back and be spit on.  Here you have. 
[01:16:30]  God damn.  That's funny.  Poor results.  That's good news.  Do we have to take a break before we do that?  Uh...  I...  You think?  No, you can go.  You can roll.  All right.  We got eight things.  We're spinning plates here on this show today on sticks.  We were talking about your thing.  I just was mentioning it to the guys that you had made a thing.  Why?  Was it bad?  No, it wasn't bad.  Yeah, I didn't know you guys heard...  Did you guys hear it?  No, I haven't heard anything of it.  All I know is you want to be a comedian or something? 
[01:17:00]  I don't know.  Or on the radio?  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  Well, you're on the radio.  Congratulations.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  And you gave it tape to Jim?  No, I didn't give it to him.  No, no, no, no.  I'm about to say...  Here's what happened.  We were talking.  We rolled the elevator down the other day and she was saying she made a CD and she was  going to give it to me to listen to.  But I don't like to have the only copy of anything because I don't trust myself because  I'm an ass.  I'm like, no, no, no.  I'm making another copy.  Give me a copy.  You keep the original.  So she came in and I saw her and I asked him, I'm like, oh, yeah, I think that Francine,  did she make a copy?  Because I was going to get a copy of it. 
[01:17:30]  And he's like, yeah, she did.  So I heard like a minute of it.  Like there was a copy.  I didn't hear all of it.  I heard like a minute of it.  And what is this tape?  You're just doing stuff?  Riffing?  I'm just saying, you know, about all the things I get angry about.  That's all.  Just riffing?  Yeah, just riffing.  It's like a comedy tape without an audience, right?  Pretty much.  Yeah, pretty much.  But it's just clips.  All right.  I have it here with me.  Where is it?  Nice Jewish girl like you doing this?  I'm not Jewish.  Oh, really?  You sounded Jewish.  Oh, but she's a lovely ebony princess.  I'm an atheist. 
[01:18:00]  I heard like a...  Can you talk into the microphone, Jim, please?  You know what?  I really am zero.  Jim's walking around.  I'm sorry.  Chris from Philly, Jacko is no longer Blacko.  I had that one in the beginning and I didn't use it.  That was very funny.  Yeah, sure you did.  Uh, John.  Yeah?  What's up, John?  Hey, what's up?  It's John DelBennie from White Plains.  All right, go.  Ready?  Yeah.  Oh, my God, yeah.  All right.  It's Jacko. 
[01:18:30]  If you're 12 years old, he'll nut on your back-o.  We kind of did a back-o.  We had a back-o.  You could say something like, after Voss sucked his mule, it smelled like tobacco.  Here's Mike D from Boston.  Jacko likes young C as a snack-o.  Mike, what's up?  Mikey.  Hey.  Hey.  Am I on?  Yeah, go.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Hey, how about you'll never see Jacko with a black-o? 
[01:19:00]  Black-o.  How about Jacko married Hedda and gave her a smack-o?  I had a Nussbaum joke.  Wow.  What is this, 1978?  Thank God.  Hey, God, man.  Oh, Jacko drove with Dale Earnhardt and crashed on the track-o.  That's not...  You're missing the point.  You're sore, taking it out of the realm of what it was. 
[01:19:30]  Look, Dale from Jersey, Norton ruined it.  Why did Francine leave?  Hey, where'd Francine go?  Jesus.  Where'd she go?  Ah, Bill, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  We weren't done with you, Francine.  Okay, fine.  All right.  What's up, Bill?  Yeah, Francine wants to do an act without an audience, just like Boss.  All right.  What's...  Boss isn't even here today, guys.  What's up with that?  Come on.  All right, we'll get to the Francine tape next.  How's that?  Okay, cool. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, wait.  That means we got a problem.  What?  Sean.  Sean.  Yo.  You picked a weird day today, man.  We're, like, all over the place, but we really want to get to you.  You're not going...  Dude, you're hanging for a few minutes, right?  Yeah, man.  I've been hanging forever.  I don't know, man.  These guys are going to have to put up a second mortgage for my house for this phone call.  See that?  That's plenty of good stuff we want to hear on the air.  No, Sean.  Seriously?  Yo.  As we get closer to five, we get a bigger audience anyway, so it works out in your favor.  Yeah, I was thinking that, too. 
[01:20:30]  This is pretty good.  I mean...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Am I on the air?  You're cleaning up that language.  I'm sorry.  Am I on the air?  Yes.  Well, when you're on the air, you're not going to be able to use it on the line.  Oh, I didn't know I was on the air, dude.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Hold on.  We'll get into all that in a little bit, okay?  All right.  But you can tell by listening to the show today, we're going in eight different directions,  so just hang with us, okay?  It's basically a hodgepodge.  All right, Cousy.  Yeah, we like the hodgepodge.  Hold on, Sean.  Yeah, no problem.  You know, I would rather get to Sean than Francine.  You're telling me this tape's pretty good, Francine? 
[01:21:00]  Dude, I've heard 30 seconds of it.  I really didn't hear what it was.  The only way I know what it is is because she told me we talked, and I'm like, oh, yeah,  Steve had it.  Okay.  All right.  I have it.  All right.  Can you get it?  I'm going to...  I'll go get it.  Okay, you got it.  Can you mention it?  We'll put it on the air, and we'll see how good Francine is at doing this riffing, this  comedy, this thing that, the stuff that pisses her off, okay?  Right.  All right.  We'll do that in a little bit, Anthony.  All righty.  Also, new contestants up on opanthony.com for the wow contest. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, how many we got now?  Sacramento making a nice comeback today.  We're up to, I think, close to 90 girls.  Wow.  Wow.  So we're just about done with qualifying.  We're going to get down here, ladies.  We have about 10 more slots left.  That is it.  If we get a few over 100, that's fine.  But as soon as we hit 100, that's it for the qualifying, okay?  I'll say.  Right.  All right.  You want to do another Sergeant Hartman prank call?  I love these.  Hey, can I hear Ted Williams' daughter again?  Oh, sure.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body. 
[01:22:00]  We can freeze his head.  You're grumpy, clumpy.  What's your name, fat body?  Excuse me?  What's your name, scumbag?  F*** you.  What have we got here?  A f*** comedian.  Do you suck f***?  Do you suck f***?  You don't scare me.  I don't know, but I'll push, uh, uh, Star 58.  Star 58 and get the, the, them to record it.  Oh, you little maggot.  You make me want to film it.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. Line is there for you when life sucks. 
[01:22:30]  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-WNEW.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's go to Sean finally, man.  He's on the phone and he cannot wait because he's doing his radio sound. 
[01:23:00]  Hello?  He's on the phone.  Hello?  That was great acting ability.  Oh, yes.  Hey, Sean.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How about some timing?  Hey, it's beautiful timing.  Hey, Sean, hold on a second, okay?  We got Psycho Tim from Psycho Tim.com walking toward a, uh, a building, let's just say.  Yes.  Sean, can you please hold on a minute?  Are you guys, like, clowning with me?  Are you guys serious?  No, we want to get to you.  We're just all over the place today.  Please hold on, Sean.  Do you listen to this show every day, Sean? 
[01:23:30]  Uh, to be honest, yeah, I hear you every now and again.  Do you think we're messing with you, Sean?  I play a lot of video games.  Do you think we're messing with you?  Well, my friend Josh, who just called me up, was like, dude, they're messing with you, man.  And he goes, I called him up and he goes, I know that kid.  I'm a good friend with him.  And he goes, and you guys hung up on him.  And we got to get to, uh, Tim.  Do you have a brain for yourself?  Do you think, uh, we're messing with you or not?  I really would think not.  All right, hold on.  This is good entertainment here.  Oh, actually, it's good politics.  Sean, hold on, because now you're starting to piss me off.  We're not messing with you.  All right, good politics, gentlemen. 
[01:24:00]  I'm holding.  All right, hold on.  All right, brother.  There goes Sean.  He's going to talk about world peace.  He thinks we're messing with him.  But we're not, because we've got Psycho Tim on the line.  And this can't wait.  Uh, Timmy.  Sean, gentlemen, what's up?  What's going on, Tim?  Nothing.  I'm just entering the building right now.  All right.  You're entering.  Hold on.  You're entering what building?  Uh, a building in Brighton, let's just say.  WAAF's building.  Ah.  All right. 
[01:24:30]  I got a dead plant.  Okay.  A pie, so they can throw it for charity.  Okay.  And it balloons.  I'm going to get in the elevator right now.  It might be a few seconds.  All right.  Uh, explain real fast as he goes through the front door there.  Our old boss when we worked at, uh, WAAF, uh, the guy that, uh, did nothing when we got  fired, that spineless worm, Dave Dickless, Dave Douglas, uh, has been fired from, uh, WAAF.  Yesterday was one of the happiest days of our lives. 
[01:25:00]  And you know what the great thing is?  We knew before he even knew.  That's right.  The whole staff was saying, those guys are a bunch of asses.  I'm looking at him right now.  He's not fired.  No.  Gone.  See, we broke the news.  Right.  We did that.  And to tell you the truth.  He didn't even know when we found out.  Hi, how's it going today?  I'm here to, uh, deliver something to Dave Douglas from AF.  He left the day already?  Paid him just in case.  Because then I was supposed to deliver a droid to his hands. 
[01:25:30]  Where are you, Tim?  Uh, at the reception desk.  Oh.  At our, at our, at our old radio station there, eh?  Yeah, great.  This lady's nice enough to page him for me.  And what did, uh, what did she say?  Where is he?  Tim?  Yep.  Uh, where is he today?  I think he left the building.  Oh, no.  Christ?  Can we leave him a package or no?  No, this is from, uh, old friends.  To Dave.  Is he not here anymore? 
[01:26:00]  He got fired.  Really?  Yeah.  Did he get all the stuff out of here so far?  Did he?  What are they saying?  Excuse me?  What are they saying?  That he got fired.  He got fired.  Oh.  Well, what we did is we brought in a pie for him.  Because we wanted, for a charity, they said that sometimes at this company that, if you  do something bad, they can, they can do a, like a charity pie throwing contest.  To get their jobs.  To get their jobs.  Good.  Yeah.  Makes it look good.  PR firm type of stuff.  I was wondering. 
[01:26:30]  PR firm.  Yeah.  Let me do that.  Yeah, sure.  We got a pie in there.  Blueberry, I thought.  That usually explodes better.  And the plant.  It's a dead plant, right?  And a dead plant.  Well, it wasn't, that's all we had at the store.  Your name is?  I'm Tim.  Nice to meet you.  Yeah.  So, be sure to get this from, this is from all friends.  You can tell them who it's from. 
[01:27:00]  It's from Opie and Anthony, actually.  They're on the air right now.  Is Rocco around?  No.  Where's Rocco?  Rocco's on here?  Oh, he's on the air?  Oh.  Can't speak to him, can we?  Ask him, ask him how long is that going to last?  Ask him.  I'm from Boston.  I'm on the air right now in New York.  Ask him if there's an over and under on how many days Rocco will last with the new PD.  They want to know what the over and under is on Rocco's career with the new PD. 
[01:27:30]  What?  You don't know?  There's no predictions here at the station?  He's nervous.  He's stuttering.  You can't do it?  Come on, give us a little inside.  How's the new guy?  All right, hold on.  Someone else is coming up to get me.  All right.  Someone else is coming?  Yeah.  Who is that?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  If I hear that voice, I'll laugh my ass off. 
[01:28:00]  Get out.  Well, I can't lie to you, they've got better offices than you guys got.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  What do they got?  Security at the door there?  No, I walked right by the security guard downstairs.  He was drooling in his cup or something.  Yeah.  And the lady's right at the reception is very nice, so she's been helping me.  Right.  And Dave's left the building, huh?  I thought he was supposed to continue on for a couple of weeks.  No, this gentleman, Mike, I believe his name was, said that he took all his stuff.  Oh, he packed up that box on his desk of all of his little plaque that says Dave Dickless, 
[01:28:30]  program director, and put it in the box and left.  All right, Tim, hold on a second.  We got one of our old friends on the line.  Scorch!  Oh, isn't life beautiful sometimes, huh?  Hey, Scorch!  What's happening, my boy?  Scorch was fired by Dave Dickless many years ago.  Scorch.  When Dave sat him down and said, you're a pizza and I'm looking for a hamburger.  Yeah, it would appear that the world, Dave, no offense, you hate to see anybody lose their 
[01:29:00]  job, but you know what, Dave, Dick was there, it's, uh, I think the world is looking for  pizza right now, and you just happen to be a really bad hamburger.  How great is it?  Hey, you know what?  It's a beautiful thing.  I got a message this morning about five o'clock on my cell phone, and you guys called  and said, did you hear it, Dave Dickless?  Oh, it made my whole day well worthwhile.  Scorch, we were the ones that broke the news.  I heard you guys talking about it.  The whole staff was in denial, they're like, they're just messing, and this is just one 
[01:29:30]  of their stupid bits and jokes, and I'm looking at him right now, and he didn't even know.  We knew before he did.  This is something that I think is very interesting.  One of the trade websites said that the new PD will be taking over the duties in two weeks.  Now, I believe the way radio works, they would have liked to have had Dave in there, even  knowing they were firing him, for that two weeks, until they get the new guy, and then 
[01:30:00]  they would fire Dave.  I think we forced their hand yesterday, because we got it on such inside info that it wasn't  supposed to be released.  So, I think we kept him out of there two weeks early.  It's a beautiful thing, and like I said, you know what, you don't really want to see  any normal human being lose their job.  He doesn't qualify as that.  With him, I'm really happy he's gone.  Where did psycho Tim go?  Tim, hold on, hold on, hold on, Scorch.  Is he brawling?  Ben, what happened?  You picked up Tim. 
[01:30:30]  What was going on?  He was saying he wasn't leaving until he could talk to Rocco, and he was there just two seconds  ago, I don't know what happened.  Oh, it looks like security got to him.  Get him out!  Maybe he'll call back.  Yes, Scorch?  I've got to say, you guys just came out in Albany at my sister station, and the first  book, the first trend that came out last week, you were already marking huge gains in the  Albany market, so we wanted to welcome you to the New York Central area.  Thank you, Scorch.  And Scorch-1.com, by the way, it's up and running. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  How are you guys doing?  Good?  We're doing good.  Pretty good, Scorch.  We're good, good.  I'm glad that everything's going well.  I'm just so damn happy that I know y'all.  It makes me feel privileged.  All right, Scorch.  We'll talk to you soon, okay?  You definitely will.  Thanks, guys, for having me on.  And Dave?  Cool.  Another guy that was done wrong by Dave Dickless.  Yep.  There it is.  It all comes back.  All right, Ant.  What?  Well, we've got to get to Francine. 
[01:31:30]  Francine!  Why does she leave?  Where'd she go?  Sean!  Hey, what's going on, bro, Sam?  You know what?  What's going on?  You're looking out so bad today, it's not even funny.  Guess what the 5 o'clock bit's going to be.  What's that?  This will be you.  You're talking about world peace.  Really?  Yeah.  All right, I can fill up the gap because I'm going to talk about, I mean, this really...  Well, save it for when we talk about it.  All right.  All right, hold on, okay?  Sure.  All right, there goes Sean.  He's on hold.  We'll use him next.  Psycho Tim is back. 
[01:32:00]  Tim?  Yeah, I'm going to say, hey, what's going to happen?  They were like, wait for a few seconds until I was coming out to you.  All of a sudden, I turn around, there's like 19 suits behind me.  Like, we don't want to be broadcast.  You better get out of here.  And this old guy pushes me, and I'm like, I will knock you the F out if you touch me again.  I was like, I'm allowed to be in this place.  I'm just dropping off a gift for somebody.  He's like, you can't broadcast.  You can't broadcast.  All suits are.  He's not broadcasting.  You're making a phone call.  The idiot doesn't even know the laws.  Tell them to shove it.  We can talk to whoever we want.  You can't be here.  You can't be here.  I'm like, F you. 
[01:32:30]  I can do whatever I want to.  What are you going to do about it?  Oh, you old geezers.  So what was happening?  You were sitting there with your little plant and your pie just made it?  Your dead plant?  I turn around, and there's like 19 guys all in ties, which are the easiest guys to fight,  because you hold on to the tie when you punch them in the face.  Tim's a fighter, man.  He is.  If you've got a long hair on a tie, you're dead in three punches.  You learned that in Salve.  Yeah.  Hey, Tim, I wouldn't take that.  Go back in and fight.  Yeah, well, not to call the cops.  I heard them on the security with the downstairs, like, and not let me back in. 
[01:33:00]  All right, where are you?  You sound like you're on the road.  I'm on the road right now.  I'm on the road right now.  I'm just putting mob stickers all around right now.  There you go.  All right, man.  All right, psychotim.com, right?  Yeah, thank you, sir.  All right.  Thank you, Tim.  Bye, Angel.  Well, we go to deliver a lovely gift to Dave Dickless.  You don't seem happy today, Anthony.  And apparently, boy, they took no time in clearing his stuff out of there and throwing  them right out on his ass.  Why wouldn't they be happy at 20 Guest Street on the third floor there in Massachusetts? 
[01:33:30]  That's in Brighton.  Brighton.  Yeah.  The people of Brighton are usually very friendly and nice, Anthony.  Where are they?  What's that location?  20 Guest Street on the third floor.  Seems like they don't want any gifts today.  No gifts?  They don't want pies and gifts and plants.  Right by the brand new New Balance building.  You wouldn't want to send anyone over there.  It's right on the corner of Market and Guest Street.  Guest Street.  20 Guest Street on the third floor.  If you want to deliver your gifts.  Your gifts.  Don't deliver a gift because I'm sure they'll get them to Dave. 
[01:34:00]  He's probably in a rough time of his life right now and needs the support.  And I think we should be there giving him gifts like Psycho Tim.  He's, you know, he's holding out a, I can't even say.  An olive branch.  The olive branch, yes.  Too bad it has dog crap on it.  Well, you know, and I know how it is to be fired.  To be kicked out of the office for the last time.  And then you go home and you wonder who your friends are.  You wonder who's going to call you and lend their support. 
[01:34:30]  Who's going to call?  Right.  Say, hey, you know, sorry to hear about that.  You know, you guys did a great job for us.  No.  Nothing.  Dave, God, what a great day.  And he was supposed to be there for two more weeks.  They were going to keep it a big secret about Dave getting the boot.  Can't keep our mouths shut anymore.  Jack off.  Jack-o. 
[01:35:00]  One to go.  Fat boy, you're next.  Guaranteed, you're next.  Fired-o Dave-o.  Douchebag.  Schlocko is the next to go-o.  Schlocko.  Schlocko, Rocco, to go-o.  Go-o.  I know.  You have to put a consonant in there.  I know.  I blew it.  Vinny vowel.  Schlocko has got to go-o.  Oh, no.  It still doesn't work.  There's no K in there.  It doesn't rhyme.  Go-o.  I know.  I'm trying.  Hey, roll, roll, roll-o, your boat-o. 
[01:35:30]  See, you can do it forever.  No one wins that way.  All right.  Schlocko.  Hey.  Good luck.  Francino.  I know.  We're going to get to Francino's tape next-o.  Next-o.  I didn't even have the T in there.  Psycho Tim's calling back again.  Hold on.  I think he's at 20 Guest Street in Brighton, Anthony.  Third floor, right?  Mm-hmm.  Tim.  Yeah.  Just go right down North Beacon out of Boston.  Take a right on the market and a right on the Guest Street.  It's up on your left.  It's a big silver building. 
[01:36:00]  Not that I wasn't just there.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Tim.  I'll be waiting up front.  All right.  Cool.  Godspeed, Tim.  Tim's going to be waiting outside, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think we're going to have a little party in the parking lot today.  Big day for the O&A show.  Rocco's going to have more time in afternoons for Snack-o.  Very funny.  All right.  Sean and Francine next on the O&A show.  Let me lick that off. 
[01:36:30]  Coming soon to the O&A show.  Sex for Sam.  Three.  Three.  Three.  This is the O&A show.  We've got lots of new contestants up on opianthony.com.  The Wow Contest.  A lot of people emailing and calling saying, how do we vote?  The voting hasn't begun.  We need 100 girls.  100 girls.  That's right.  And we're also trying to put together a just blowout road show with these girls. 
[01:37:00]  Hopefully they'll figure it out down the hall and we'll have details soon.  Okay?  Right.  We haven't done a road show in a very long time in New York City.  Hopefully we'll have details soon.  And I'm getting backed up on the girls here.  I haven't even checked out some of the newer ones.  It's funny because Jay Moore is in a picture.  Which, what number?  Wow Contestant number 87, Amy from Dallas.  You're checking out her pictures.  All of a sudden Jay Moore pops up, giving us the finger.  His arm around one of the contestants. 
[01:37:30]  Keep going.  You'll see it.  Oh, when I, I, I.  Yeah.  It's not in the thumbnail.  It was hidden.  I mean, it's one of the thumbnails, but you don't see Jay in the thumbnail.  You get it?  Oh, jeez.  Look at that.  Isn't that classic?  Holy jeez.  Yeah.  All right.  So check it out for yourself.  opiananthony.com.  We really want to get a huge road show together as far as this Wow Contest goes, you know?  Get the 20 finalists.  We all party somewhere. 
[01:38:00]  I like it.  And have a good old time.  So let's get to work.  Ethel.  We like Ethel.  Lots of instant feedback coming in, Anthony.  Yes.  Andrew from Edison.  Where is the big wazoo taking the Wow pictures?  On the sun?  Tell Tom Edison out there to kill the light.  Yeah, their pictures are a little too bright.  And Cousin Brian from Staten Island.  Hey, Ted Williams has one up on Rich Voss.  He waited until he died to be ice cold.  Voss has been ice cold since the first day he hit the stage. 
[01:38:30]  Poor Voss.  Come on.  That is funny.  I'm not even here to fight back.  No.  I know.  I hate when that happens.  Where's Francine?  She's right here.  Francine.  Back into the microphone.  I'm here.  There we go.  Okay, Anthony, once again, Francine, because now it's been about 40 minutes.  We've got to re-explain this, I guess.  Well, Francine, I haven't heard this yet, but you had some studio time when?  Friday.  Friday?  Last week.  And you went in and just riffed a little in front of the mic? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, just a little bit.  Because what do you want to do with you?  You're one of our interns, obviously.  And what do you want to do?  What kind of field do you want to get into?  Well, originally I was inspired by you guys.  Ah.  Yes.  Inspired.  Yes, inspired.  And you want to get into radio or some kind of comedy?  Something like that, yes.  And you told Jim Norton that you had kind of riffed a little in front of the mic and you  threw it down on tape?  Yeah.  And I guess Jim heard, did you hear any of this? 
[01:39:30]  I had probably heard less than 30 seconds.  I just happened to walk in and ask Steve something and I remember that she had told me she was  going to put it on CD.  Okay.  Get me a copy.  And I was like, oh, dude, did you see?  Because I didn't even know she was here.  I hadn't even seen it yet.  Is this something like that would be for stand-up comedy or would it be for on air?  It sounded like it was a stand-up comedy.  Yeah.  I couldn't tell.  The first 30 seconds is basically just me going, saying nothing.  Saying nothing.  Yeah, nothing really.  And then I went on and I talked a little bit, but it's not full scripts. 
[01:40:00]  It's just pieces.  Because I didn't bring my books with me.  It was just, you know.  You got books?  Yeah.  So you just went off.  You do some of that reading?  Yeah, I read.  What you're reading for?  We got us a reader.  Not Phil Hicks.  What are you reading?  What are you reading for?  No, I'm...  I guess I read for many reasons.  What you reading for?  One, so I don't become a waitress at a Waffle House.  At the Waffle House.  Sorry.  Phil Hicks is our hero. 
[01:40:30]  Yes, Francine?  Yes.  So you want us to listen to some of your tape and give us some...  Yeah, but like I said, the first 30 seconds, I don't think it should go on there because  it's really nothing.  All right.  Well, so it's only the first 30 seconds that you're worried about?  Yeah, something like that.  Okay.  No, I'm just making sure.  Would you be up for constructive criticism?  Yes.  You guys can criticize as much as you want.  Oh, well, that's how you're going to get better.  Yeah.  That's right.  It's not like the first tape you send to a radio show, all of a sudden you get a gig. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, I didn't think...  Oh, wait.  That's how I got mine.  Yeah, wait a minute.  I had to sit with PDs and play my crap and have them yell at me over and over again.  That's how I got better.  Well, although I didn't impress one program director right from the start.  Dave Dickless.  Dave Dickless.  Didn't get the Anthony thing.  Went to Opie and said, what's with the Anthony thing?  I don't understand.  I don't really understand.  He doesn't have the radio experience. 
[01:41:30]  You know, perhaps we can get a ticket number at Fenway and get you a partner that way.  Fired!  Fired!  Fired!  Must be a little uncomfortable around those hallways today, huh?  Max, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  So, I just wanted to let you guys know, I live to BCN up here in Boston.  Yeah.  And you guys have sort of sparked a minor celebration, I think, at BCN with breaking the news that Dave was fired.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard Nick Carter, I'm sure you guys know Nick Carter, he was talking today, he was like, 
[01:42:00]  you know, if you guys notice that AAF, the DJs seem a little distracted, it's probably because they're surfing the internet looking for new jobs or something like that.  Well, it's a known fact on radio, if a PD goes and they bring in a new guy, the new guy wants to hire a whole bunch of the people he knows.  Clean house, and then they hire the people that he's familiar with and he knows his talent.  Yeah, I think Nick said something like a new broom sweeps clean.  That's it.  That's what they do.  He's the new broom.  Sweep it clean.  Guaranteed, Fat Boy is next.  Hey, Jim, you rule, dude.  Thanks, fella.  The clock continues to tick for Fat Boy. 
[01:42:30]  Schlocko on the chopping blocko.  All right, thank you, Max.  Hey, talk to you guys later.  All right, let's get to Francine's.  He's watching the ticking clocko.  So Francine wants to do some radio or maybe come stand up, right?  Yeah.  And she was brave enough to go into a studio and riff for us.  All right.  And she openly admits that the first 30 seconds.  30 seconds are a little, you know, you had to get into your groove.  Yeah, because I didn't number them.  All right, I just want to make sure people understand the first 30 seconds.  Just 30 seconds. 
[01:43:00]  And you weren't, one thing is, was this made for Eric?  Because she wasn't shy about getting it.  She wasn't like, no.  She was like, yeah, I'll go grab it, which is cool.  Yeah, it wasn't made for Eric.  It was just me just going off.  But you're proud of some of the material on this CD, it's safe to say.  Except for the first 30 seconds.  It should be the first 30 seconds.  All right.  All right.  So, you know, we'll keep that in mind that the first 30, 30 seconds blow, right?  Something like that, yes.  Okay.  Here's Francine, our new intern.  Um, the fine Jewish girl there from, uh, Dix Hills. 
[01:43:30]  From Maranek.  Oh, wait, you're black.  She's from Maranek.  Oh, okay.  Not Dix Hills.  Here's the first 30 seconds of Francine's tape.  Okay, I guess it's recording.  I always want to, like, walk into, I'll walk by one of those silly coffee places with,  like, those, those windows, those see-through windows, and just knock on the window and  wave to someone and just, just, like, run away. 
[01:44:00]  I'll just, like, walk away and pretend like nothing happened.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I guess we're all in agreement that, uh, the first 30 seconds.  What does that mean?  Uh, isn't your strongest stuff?  I just wanted to hear what I sounded like on mic first.  Oh, oh, okay.  Yeah, I told you guys the first 30 seconds sucked.  Almost like a level check.  Yeah.  What was the do-do-do-do-do-do-do?  I have to ask that.  What was the do-do-do-do-do-do-do?  I was like, you know, we want to make sure the mic is on.  Like mic check one, two, whatever. 
[01:44:30]  Opie does that before the hot wire reads.  Yeah.  When I'm not here.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Anthony from Brooklyn, you wise-ass.  So this is the better Opie we're listening to?  Yeah, it used to be a lot worse.  You dick.  Okay, so let's get the, we got the 30 seconds out of the way.  Okay.  And, uh, you're more proud of the rest of the 35 minutes of, uh, material, right?  Life goes on, right.  That was 30 seconds?  Yeah, that was the first 30 seconds.  Uh, what?  There might be another, uh, 30 seconds or not?  Can you guys just fast forward a little bit more? 
[01:45:00]  Uh, you, you want us to, to-  No, go ahead, it's fine.  Let's just play it through.  Go ahead, play it through.  Are you going to openly admit maybe the next, uh-  Yes, it's going to suck more.  The third, the, the next 30 seconds is going to suck just as bad as the first 30?  Yeah.  Okay, well, let's listen.  Let's listen.  Sometimes I get so bored.  I wish I smoked cigarettes, so I just roll up, uh, pieces of paper and pretend to smoke  and people look at me like I'm crazy. 
[01:45:30]  I guess so.  Yeah.  Yeah, smoking sucks because you stink.  Okay, right?  Well, that's an observation and a PSA all in one.  What are you guys doing?  That's like an observation and a PSA.  Yeah, with some of that observational humor.  Yeah.  Thank you.  So do you really do that?  You roll up, uh, uh-  Yes, I, I do that sometimes.  And make believe.  Do you ever do that and knock on the window at the coffee shop and make it just one bitch? 
[01:46:00]  Easy, Norton.  Hey.  Both in one.  Hey, she's just starting out.  That's a little too complicated.  And did you ever knock on the window and just run away or is that something you wanted to do?  No, it's just, you know, things I think about when I'm-  Yeah.  All right, it's safe to say, though, you weren't, uh, happy with that riff.  No, I'm not with that one.  Those are just still thoughts.  Okay.  This is not the funny part.  You're just the thoughts.  Yes.  All right.  Good thoughts.  Fewer six.  I mean, uh, no, it's good.  Let's, uh, continue with the tape here.  Why are you looking away, Jim? 
[01:46:30]  I'm-  You all right?  Okay.  All right, it's Francine, our new intern.  Riffing.  I can never figure out why people smoke.  You know, it's just this little small stick that, you know, you suck on and smoke comes out when you blow.  And I always wonder if people really weigh the options and all the, you know, stupid stuff that could happen if you smoke.  I mean, there's, like, birth defects and dad teeth, like, loss and smelliness and holes in your clothes and, like, burn down your house and stuff. 
[01:47:00]  And all that cancer.  Yeah.  Yeah, people are stupid.  Yeah, because I used to work at a gas station.  And sometimes, like, people would come in.  And the funny thing is, like, the gas station made more money in cigarettes than it did in gas.  So, it was real funny, because a guy would come in with, like, a humongous SUV. 
[01:47:30]  Be like, uh, what is it, GMC, Jim A400, DX, 2000, whatever.  And he'd be like, oh, give me a carton of cigarettes and, like, $2 in gas.  And I'm sitting there, like, where are you going, like, down the street?  You need, like, $20 to gas, because, like, you a-hole moron.  Okay.  Uh, we are past the first 30 seconds.  Um, it's still-  You're a little, uh- 
[01:48:00]  That's funny.  You're a little obsessed with the whole cigarette smoking thing.  That was funny.  I like the comedy that went along with how you're talking about the dangers of smoking.  And cancer wasn't even as high on the list as burning your clothes.  Yeah.  Did you mean to, like, put it like that?  It was-  The comedy?  Thoughts.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, yes.  Because I-  Devoid of any-  Yeah, it's like, yeah, like, the holes in the clothes.  You're right.  The holes in the clothes.  All of a sudden, you're like, yeah, it stinks.  The holes in the clothes. 
[01:48:30]  You're going to burn yourself.  Oh, and then that cancer.  That's funny.  Like, it kind of, you know, went down the, uh, list there.  Yeah.  Cancer was an afterthought.  Right.  Yeah.  And then the SUV thing, the guy, uh, you know, he's $2 worth of gas, but he buys a carton  of cigarettes.  Yeah, that really used to happen at the gas station.  I don't doubt it.  Yeah.  That's like, some of the best comedy comes from, uh, real life experience.  From, uh, comedians.  There you go.  Uh, so you're in college?  Yes, I am.  Okay. 
[01:49:00]  Uh, what fine college?  NYU.  NYU.  NYU should be proud today.  Some of the greats.  One of their own on the radio today.  What?  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  Why are they yelling and screaming outside the studio?  Okay, uh, let's go on with Francine's, um, rant CD, we're going to call it.  All right.  Another rant.  Let's give a listen.  Can't we just fast forward?  I feel real bad for, uh, mall coppers because they walk around with their little batons and  their gigantor walkie-talkies and they're so unimportant and stupid. 
[01:49:30]  And I'm like, gosh, it must really suck to be one of these guys because they  got, like, no power.  All they can say is, uh, you know, look here, uh, we think you stole something, so  you're going to have to stop until the cops come.  Yeah, and the cops do all the work because, yeah, because we suck.  We don't really have a real job.  We walk around with these stupid uniforms and that stupid stripe down their pants.  They look so dumb. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  All right.  Kids say the darndest things, don't they?  Yeah.  Has Cosby called you?  No, Cosby hasn't called you.  I could help you with your comedy.  Just wear some loose-fitting, I'll wear the loose-fitting sweatpants and you can put your  hands on the front of it.  You got the gif, honey.  You got the gif of comedy that I was told I had by Camille. 
[01:50:30]  It's fantastic.  I like how you went off on the rent-a-cap thing.  Thank you, Cosby.  All right.  We're about five minutes into this tape, right?  That's five minutes?  Yeah.  Okay.  The first five minutes sucked, Ed.  All right.  So this next one's going to be really good? 
[01:51:00]  I hope so.  All right.  Let's go.  Okay.  I've come to a point in my life where I think dating is just stupid because if you have  all these rules that make no sense, like you can't cheat and stuff, because you know  everybody's going to cheat anyway, so I think we need to be a little bit more realistic, even  if you get married.  You know, men are always going to cheat because they're just, yeah, I guess.  Yeah, because I just suggest that all women, we should just all become homewreckers and 
[01:51:30]  start sleeping with each other's husbands, because they're going to cheat anyway.  Yeah, because, yeah, because most men are going gay anyway.  I mean, like, what the hell?  I swear to everybody.  Oh, that was it?  That sucked.  No, that was...  They might have jumped out a few times there, because you've got a potty mouth. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, you're, like, on the edge there.  You're blue.  You said guys think with their, let's say, their little head.  Yeah.  Yes, they do.  Okay, it'll get better.  I promise.  Okay?  All right.  Who cares?  There's no rush.  There's no rush.  There's 524.  It's all right.  Well, the feedback is very supportive so far, sure.  Yeah.  All right.  There's no rush, because when you go to a comedy club, you know, you've got a half hour  to try to make them laugh. 
[01:52:30]  Here.  So, this next one, what do you think?  I hope it's better.  It's all right.  Don't panic.  No, you've got to be very confident.  Don't be patty-patty on us here?  Yeah.  Things are all right.  You've got to be confident.  Okay, okay.  You've got to be confident in your material.  Thank you.  All right, I'll try.  Things turn around.  I mean, so, you know, believe me.  It's pretty scary.  So far, this has gone, like, Flight 800, but, I mean, it definitely could turn around.  Are you playing the comics of Whitney High tape? 
[01:53:00]  Okay, here's our intern, Frencie.  You know what I think's really funny?  Uh-oh.  You guys with fancy cars, because they're so funny.  It's like they come up to you, and they're fancy cars, and they're all expecting you to  be all impressed, and they all say these really stupid lines, like, hey, you're real pretty.  Yeah, like, I don't know, dummy.  Yeah, and they all expect you to just come up to their car and start kissing their feet  and sleep with them the next day and whatnot. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah!  Especially ugly guys in fancy cars and more into the hot guys in fancy cars, because then  I'll probably sleep with you the next day.  Oh, Saturn.  Wow.  I probably got through with our new dump guy.  Yeah.  Well, you like hot guys with...  Wait.  Hot guys with fancy cars. 
[01:54:00]  Fancy cars and their limousines.  But ugly guys, fancy cars, no go.  No go.  But hot guys, fancy cars, you'll sleep with them the next day, you said.  Well, I don't know.  Well, because, well, this is your stage persona.  Hey, good news, Dustin Diamond called, he wants you to open for him.  Thank you.  No, that's a good lead.  Dustin Diamond.  No, he's not, he sucked.  Come on.  Wow.  He really must have sucked.  What's the next bit?  What's the next bit?  A bit?  I don't know.  That's right.  What is it? 
[01:54:30]  I don't know.  I just said stuff.  I was just talking.  This is kind of like, it was like what Pryor would do.  Oh.  Which is kind of Aaron Pryor.  Just riff.  All right.  I think the growth on his eyebrow is funnier.  But the, yeah, the feedback, very supportive though.  Yeah.  You want to read a few, Ant?  No. 
[01:55:00]  Why?  She needs some positive reinforcement here, Anthony.  It takes a lot of balls to do this.  Oh, yeah.  And it's a tape.  And go on in 21 cities.  I don't know if this guy is even, he just says, I'm changing the station.  Ah.  The A-H-H-H-H thing.  Because he's laughing too hard, Ant.  What does that say, bitch?  That bitch.  This guy.  Ant? 
[01:55:30]  I'd rather listen to Sean on hold.  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  This is pretty entertaining.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, there's 30 minutes left.  I think we could do a couple more minutes.  Yeah, I agree.  Why not?  Look at that.  30 minutes.  What does stop the insanity mean?  I don't know.  This is good if you put this on the machine with the ocean sounds or the rain.  Yeah, you're right.  This is actually stream of conscience. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, stream of conscience.  Right.  A lot of comedians do that stream of consciousness.  And sheep lovers making an observation on your observations.  A lot of things are stupid to her.  I noticed that too.  Yeah.  You did say stupid like 40 times so far.  Really?  Yeah, it wasn't like that in any mind.  But now you're doing a lot of stupid.  Change that around a little bit.  It'll certainly make your material stronger.  That might be a crutch.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  What's the next thing?  I have no idea.  I hope it gets better though.  Don't worry about it.  They're comparing me to Dustin Diamond. 
[01:56:30]  No, they're not.  They're saying that he wanted you to open for him because he's a big name though.  No, he's awful.  God forbid we compare you to a sitcom star.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  It could be worse.  I mean, you know, you've got to start somewhere.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  How about those guys in minivans?  Yeah, they're really funny because they always want to talk to me.  And I'm always like, hello, you're in a minivan. 
[01:57:00]  That means you have a family.  You have a gut and gray hairs and raisin balls.  I don't like raisin balls all over me.  And they're like, oh, you know, I'm borrowing this car from my aunt and whatever.  I'm like, I'm sure you are.  You're a loser.  You're in a minivan.  There's no way you can look cool in a minivan.  It's just not possible.  You know, you're just like the ugly guy in the fancy car. 
[01:57:30]  No play.  Sorry.  Yeah.  I have an observation.  It seems like you talk to a lot of guys while they're in their cars.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Maybe you picked the wrong occupation.  Yeah.  Why don't you move away from Hunt's Point?  Where do you talk to all these guys in cars?  Well, I don't really talk to them.  They talk to you?  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[01:58:00]  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Okay.  Minivans raising yam bags.  Okay.  Good stuff.  What do you think, Ant?  Huh?  Acting lessons.  Comedy lessons.  I think we have time for maybe one more.  Well, of course, man.  Go.  You know what?  This is definitely getting better.  Yeah.  The material is more coherent than it was in the beginning because in the beginning it  was just like random thoughts. 
[01:58:30]  I think Ted Williams is more coherent at this point.  Oh, I think so.  Yeah.  Okay.  What does I'd rather be diddled by a priest mean?  No.  And dude, I don't hear anybody comparing this to the LL terminal and LAX.  It's just that it's the first beginning was random thoughts and then it turns into something  cohesive.  It's the way it is in common.  Yeah.  I'm noticing a bunch of horrific places people say they'd rather be for some reason.  Yeah.  There's got to be Italian somewhere.  What's the next pit though?  Do you know what the next pit is?  Is there a part on the table where she goes, 
[01:59:00]  Ma, I'm working on this down here.  Ma, I got to get it together for Jerry.  I think she's a storyteller.  Oh, that style.  Yeah.  Maybe in the Cosby or Woody Allen type of style because they weren't more story driven.  You should sit on a stool on the stage, not walk around like that.  You should sit and just talk like that, like the Cos did. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  It's kind of like in the David Berkowitz.  I'm just realizing how bad it is.  Jesus.  Really?  I've heard worse.  No, I think it's bad.  Bad meaning no?  Because she's black.  Bad, right.  That's right.  Oh, bad.  This is bad, man.  Oh, you guys, I'm from like the suburbs.  I don't even, you know, speak with slang and stuff.  All right, word.  But let's do the next minute here.  Okay, let's try one more.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  I don't think it's that bad.  Dude.  See, we're having fun with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The material stands on its own, I think.  Yeah, I'd say it's, I mean, I don't know if it's fresh, but I mean, it's.  If we really thought it was that bad, we wouldn't be playing this for 21 cities, Francine.  Thank you.  All right.  So let's listen a little longer here.  You know what I can't stand?  You know, because I work in the mall and stuff.  Life, I used to work in the mall.  It's those stupid freaking seventh graders who shop at, what is it?  Not seventh graders. 
[02:00:30]  Those little, like, 10 and 12 year olds who shop at Victoria's Secrets.  I don't get it.  I'm like, what are you doing in Victoria's Secrets?  It's, you don't have boobs or ass yet, and you're looking for songs.  Why are you wearing songs?  You shouldn't even be wearing pants that fit that tight yet.  Well, where are your parents?  Well, what the hell has this world come to?  I still get all my underwear and panties at, like, Price Club, you know, 20 in a pack, 
[02:01:00]  and these stupid kids look, turn it look sexy.  It's just disgusting.  Whoa, wow, the S-word being thrown around like that.  A little potty mouth.  You see 10-year-olds in Victoria's Secrets?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Where's this Victoria's Secrets?  Harlem?  I don't know.  No, it was in White Plains Mall.  I've never seen a 10-year-old in Victoria's Secrets.  Well, they look like 10-year-olds. 
[02:01:30]  Is that what that was?  I couldn't really tell the addiction of a stroke victim.  I couldn't really tell where the mall was.  People want to know if Rich Voss owes you money and you're dodging him.  Is Victoria's Secrets a store up there?  Is it like a baby gap?  They have like a baby...  Baby secret?  Baby secrets?  No.  Get a cute little number for your 10-year-old? 
[02:02:00]  No.  What do you think, Jim?  I don't know.  I don't want to speculate.  Should we try another one?  You don't know Buddy Hinton, do you?  I don't know who that is.  Oh, okay.  He was a very famous comedian.  Somebody was asking.  Yeah, I should go for another one, dude.  Why not?  One more?  Yeah, good.  Okay.  It's Francine, our new intern.  Mm-hmm.  Riffin.  You know what else I really hate?  Man, you hate a lot of stuff.  You hate a lot of stuff.  You're an angry comic.  I would be angry.  You're like Kinnison, I think. 
[02:02:30]  It's kind of a Kinnison thing.  Yes.  A lot of angry, a lot of anger.  If he had like abandoned all humor.  Give us a...  I meant after the accident.  We're going to help you.  Give us a scream.  Like a Sam Kinnison scream.  Like, ah!  I don't know if I can do that right now.  You can.  Just scream.  Just think of the guys in the cars or any of those other things that get your ire.  Ah!  Oh, yeah.  Is that good?  All right.  Yeah, that's good.  I was saying, just think of the guys in the cars listening to this. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, really?  This is good stuff for 520.  Yeah.  On a Tuesday.  Yeah.  No, really.  All right.  More stuff that Francine hates.  Let's hear what she hates.  She already said, Noah, what else I hate.  Yeah.  I can't stand these moms who are like 50 shopping at Bebe and Delia's.  You know, you need to just stop trying to look sexy.  Or at least stop trying to look like you're 15 or dressing like your little 8th grade daughter.  If I ever go to freaking Bebe or Delia's and see my mom there, I'm going to just hide behind the racks and run out the store. 
[02:03:30]  Or yell at her and tell her, get her ass back in Ann Taylor.  What the hell are you doing shopping here?  These clothes, they have like sweetie and cutie and, you know, and bopsy all over them and stars.  I don't want to see my mom wearing that crap.  I don't want to see her looking like me.  What the hell, man?  Start dressing your age.  You're not hot anymore. 
[02:04:00]  You have like wrinkles.  And, you know, your stomach, your guts, it's just too big.  They're going to be hanging over your pants.  It's just not sexy.  Stop it.  It's disgusting.  Yeah.  You're talking about Norton in that last part of the, uh, no?  All right, I just...  I don't know what a Bebe's is.  What's it, Delia's?  You know a lot of stores, man.  Yeah.  You know a big thing about people with certain ages shopping in certain places. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  That could be like a theme for the album.  Oh, really?  Thanks.  Yeah.  They'll have, I can see the cover shot of the album.  Uh, you at the mall, there's an old lady in Delia's, and she's got Sweetie on the shirt,  and you got like your hand on your hip, and you're going with a finger at her, no, no.  And then there's an infant in Victoria's Secret.  Right, with a thong on.  And the name of the album is, Who the Heck Shops Where?  Question mark.  No, the album, Rick, isn't called Get Out This Store. 
[02:05:00]  You are a horrible man.  Okay.  I think we've run out of time.  Oh.  Unless you guys want to do one more.  One more, because that's probably...  I thought it was one more, though, because it took a while, but, you know, again, it becomes  a coherent piece after watching anything else.  What do you think, Francine?  Okay, we can do one more.  She likes it.  Francine, she's shy a little bit, but she's enjoying this, too, because she's getting her thoughts 
[02:05:30]  out there.  Okay.  Know what I really hate?  Oh, boy.  Again.  Another thing, you hate a lot of stuff.  You really do hate a lot of things.  I noticed that when I listened to it.  You might want to mix up the hating stuff.  Yeah.  No, I hate a lot of stuff.  Mix in maybe another observational humor piece.  You could open up your tracks with this clip.  Now you get the hell out of here!  That'd be great.  In front of one of those young stores.  Forever 21, you know, and there's some old broad in there.  Now you get the hell out of here!  You know what I hate?  The fact that we didn't prepare for today's show. 
[02:06:00]  But, you know, things happen.  He was banging interns two at a time.  Players couldn't get a laugh at the table.  Here we go.  All right.  More hate.  More hate.  About being black.  It's like black guys are into these gigantic fat chicks.  I'm like, you know, you marry a chunky chick now, she's going to be like 500 pounds after  the first baby, dummy.  You know, you want to get a small chick like me, because I'm not going to get fat over 
[02:06:30]  the next, like, 10 years.  I'm going to get fat gradually, but not after the first kid.  Then you want to divorce me and go for the next whore.  So, I'm tired of these stupid black guys that I date that keep taking me out to eat.  Not getting any bigger, you a-holes.  Eat it.  Whoa!  Wow, you're in potty mouth.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, raw.  We had to dump out there. 
[02:07:00]  She, um...  She's burning that S up as she eats it.  Yeah.  Yo.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  You take...  Hey!  Hey!  Wow.  You sure like that S word.  Francine Mooney, he's up there with the language.  You should stay in school and learn S.  That's right.  Yeah.  That, uh, went along with everything else you said in that.  Yeah.  This is where it gets raw.  Wait, wait.  Can you stand about black eyes?  All right, hold on. 
[02:07:30]  This is where it gets raw.  Yeah, this is where it gets better.  Nice.  Wow, you're throwing that F word around now.  Yeah, there's some potty mouth.  You got a problem with the black gentleman?  Yes, I do.  Do you date white guys?  I dated one white guy.  He ruined it for all of us, right?  No, not really.  He was Swiss.  It was my spring fling.  It was pretty good.  Yeah?  Swiss?  Yeah.  That's awful.  There you go.  No, he was all right.  Yodley hee. 
[02:08:00]  Swiss guys stink.  Why do you yodel in an Irish accent?  Yodley hee, don't you know?  Because I don't and shouldn't know what Swiss men sound like.  You know what's missing from this?  A snail slithering on the edge of a strange razor.  Are you a comedian, Willard?  Ohio River, sir.  All right, let's more stuff about what she hates about black guys.  Oh, I can't stand about black guys.  You know, I went to school for I don't know how many years. 
[02:08:30]  It really doesn't take that much to learn the English language.  I'm tired of all the slang and I don't understand it.  I'm just like, don't talk to me because you know what I'm saying is coming after, you know what I'm saying, after you know what I'm saying.  Man, I don't understand it.  Just read a book or, you know, it doesn't take that much to learn how to speak English.  We only use like a hundred words out of the freaking dictionary. 
[02:09:00]  Just learn those hundred and learn how to put them in place so that when you approach me, I know how to answer you instead of like getting all pissed off because I don't want to talk to you.  Whew, getting a little racy there.  I know what you're saying.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm big dick black.  Wow, okay.  Thank you, Francine.  Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love.  Send by grocery clerks to collect the bill. 
[02:09:30]  Unfortunately, we've run out of time.  Yeah.  We do have 26 minutes left on the tape.  Wow, that was only what?  That was a very long eight minutes.  No, just because we were making comments and stopping the tape.  That was eight minutes.  That was just eight minutes.  You stopped when it was getting better.  Oh, see?  You know what?  You're right.  Because it took a while to get warmed up.  Boom, boom, boom.  So you're saying that this next one is where you really hit your stride?  I don't know, but I think it got better as the tape went on because, I don't know. 
[02:10:00]  Well, at a certain point, you can't get worse.  I know, it was horrible in the beginning, so, yeah.  Are you prepared to take some criticism and just blatant abuse from listeners that don't like some of your material?  Not because it's not funny, but, you know, there's minivan drivers out there now that are all pissed off at you.  Welcome to the club.  Aaron from Jersey.  F you, Francine.  I have a minivan provided by my job.  I'm a liquor salesman with a 12-inch C and a six-figure salary.  You dumb whore.  You make no money and she'd be sucking D on 42nd Street. 
[02:10:30]  So, Aaron, a little angry at your minivan comment.  All right.  Yes.  And I'm sorry I put the name Aaron.  I don't care.  That's his problem if he doesn't like me.  Yeah.  Who cares what Aaron says?  Exactly.  This is just what you are thinking.  Two A's in the beginning of his name.  Now, the black guys you've dated, they want a bigger girl?  Is that what you were saying?  Yeah, but into these, you know, chicks who have, like, a little bit of a gut and, you know, 36 and this huge butt. 
[02:11:00]  They're not into the whole DAC vibe, right?  Yeah.  I was like, why do you always want to talk to the chunky chicks?  Yeah.  I think I'm pretty hot.  I'll say.  Well, there you go.  I want to talk to the girl with the brain.  Yeah.  Right.  Right?  The black men satisfy?  They're all right.  They're not that good.  You know what I'm saying?  It's a big myth out there.  They're not that good.  It's a myth?  Yes.  Oh, my goodness.  Really?  Really. 
[02:11:30]  But you've only been with one white guy.  How did he stack up?  He was all right.  How did the Swiss fella do?  The Swiss fella was good.  Yeah.  A little Swiss miss.  A little marshmallow in your chocolate.  A little marshmallows on the back.  Yeah.  It was for two weeks.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And then his family found out.  Yeah.  No, you have to go back home.  Oh.  Okay.  So, um...  Oh, you said the next one might be good?  I think that she was saying that...  It's like anything else, man.  You start to get cooking with grease, if I may. 
[02:12:00]  And after a while, it begins to pick up a little bit of steam.  A little steam.  Another cliche.  Yeah, I got angrier as the tape went on.  So, I said, there's more stuff that picks me up.  Yeah.  And that's when the rage comes out is when it gets...  And then you're cursing.  Do you room with, uh, Janine Garofalo?  No, I don't.  Because she's a lot like this.  Yeah, you've got very similar styles.  It's kind of like an alternative, uh, stream of consciousness kind of, uh, you know...  Too cool for the room.  Yeah.  Most of the people sit there with their hands in their lap, not clapping.  But there's one or two people.  Yeah, because their eyes are closed.  Yeah.  Because the material is so over the average man's head. 
[02:12:30]  Right into their pillow.  Oh, absolutely.  Right, there's, uh, there's an intelligence factor to your material.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, I, I, I definitely, uh...  A lot of time, it will be, especially if someone has their head down on the desk, it's going  to go right over, because...  You should go uptown to the Apollo.  Do, uh, uh, amateur night there.  I don't think so.  No?  They're mean at the Apollo.  Yeah, but they, it's, women, here's the thing.  Unlike us, they're pretty damn mean.  Yeah.  You know?  No, but the thing is, women who are, like, have an attitude do very well.  They do better than men. 
[02:13:00]  You get out there and go, mm-hmm.  No, no, you don't have to go, mm-hmm, because that's not her.  But if you, especially if you're criticizing the way men behave, the crowd will go with  you.  Oh, really?  Yeah, please, yes.  Yeah, I think you can shout out.  Sandman would come out with the hook.  Exactly.  No.  He always comes out.  They want to boo everybody just for the hell of it.  Yeah, but that wouldn't be a reflection, like, on this material.  They're just going to boo.  That's nothing you can do about it.  Yeah.  Was that a joke or just an observation?  I was a little confused.  No, it was just a thing.  Oh, that was, she was joking or?  No, no.  She's making an observation.  Observing something that happens up there.  Observing.  Oh, okay. 
[02:13:30]  Well, sometimes you don't know.  Sometimes.  No, I know.  Most times you know, but, you know, sometimes you have to figure it out.  Yeah, I know.  This is, uh...  One more?  All right, sure.  Why not?  This is absolutely, Rod Steiger's house right now is probably a better vibe than...  Francine, that's a funny name for an intern.  What do they call you at home?  Francine.  They call me Francine.  They call me Mrs. Tibbs.  You know what else I can't stand about black eyes? 
[02:14:00]  No, no.  This is a...  You know...  What?  Just hold on, you racist one.  Actually, no, no, no, no.  I want to hear what Hitler says.  I accidentally recorded it twice.  It's the next one, actually.  Oh.  Sorry.  Oh, boy.  That's not like getting shot twice.  Oh, boy.  Now how are we going to get to the next track?  Can we just...  I think just play.  It'll continue.  No, it will.  Of course you play and it continues.  Okay.  That's what you do when you hit play.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Forward.  It likes to go forward.  Motion.  Yeah.  Okay.  You throw something, it comes down.  Really? 
[02:14:30]  It goes up, must go down.  Well, you're good, too.  You know...  Let's hope you go up.  I want to...  Oh, okay.  I see what you're saying.  I think we need to come up with new songs that are really...  More real than the ones that are out nowadays.  Right.  All these stupid love songs.  Oh, baby.  I want to be with you.  I want to love you.  You know, shut up with all the crap.  Can we talk about some real issues here?  Like, hey, you dumped me last week, so I threw that brick at your windshield. 
[02:15:00]  You know, I blotted and...  Oh, jeez.  The language again.  Hey there, too raw for TV.  Wow.  You've done that kind of stuff?  Throwing bricks through a guy's windshield?  I've thought about it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, a lot of cursing on this stuff, friends.  I don't expect that out of it.  All the real stuff.  You know, your boyfriend's giving you problems.  You put your kids in the lake.  Yeah, you walk away.  They fall in.  Blah, blah, blah.  Songs.  Because that's real. 
[02:15:30]  Rudy.  Hmm.  Okay.  All right, Judy.  I actually think they should have Tom Brokaw makes a point.  It's like...  Because in relationships, I mean, there's a lot of bad things that happen.  It sure does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wonder if the listeners want to hear any more, because I'm starting to feel it now.  Dude, I'm feeling it.  I mean, I'm not going to say what people should do.  This is better than her old Mrs. Butterworth commercial.  Okay.  Why is everyone laughing outside the studio?  I don't know. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, because there's a delay, I think, and they're...  Oh, okay.  They're hearing some of the...  All right.  ...the comedy we just did.  Okay.  Well, that's Francine, our new intern.  Well, we could either play another bit or read from Mein Kampf.  I mean, whatever you want to do.  I think I'd rather have my head frozen.  I like that.  I envy that, Ted Williams.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Triogenically frozen.  Sometimes death is a good thing.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Eardrums just completely frozen solid.  Not a vibration of sound gets through.  Nope.  No.  All right, Francine, everyone.  Francine, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  So much.  Now you get the hell out of here!  I think I would give you a...  Passing grade.  Oh!  You can listen to the rest of it after the show.  After the show.  After the show?  I might...  I actually would listen to...  If I'm clogged, I need to loosen up.  Yeah.  I'm still on the air.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you're still on the air. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, okay.  That's what that light usually means in here.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  If everyone's sitting around with headphones on and they've got these microphones...  And we're talking into these things, yeah.  Half an inch from their face, that usually means we're on the air.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Come on, man.  That's all.  I'm just, you know, stating the obvious.  All right.  Next time, I'll know.  Okay.  All right.  Well, we've got the 25 more minutes of this.  Maybe we'll break it out on another slow...  I mean, on another day.  Oh, dude.  I would definitely.  Cool.  You know?  Absolutely.  Thanks, guys.  Maybe on another slow news day.  Thank you, Francine. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you, Francine.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There she goes.  All happy.  What a great job.  You can leave the studio now.  Cool.  Just riffing.  Okay.  I'll leave now.  Okay.  All right.  That's cool.  We've got the headphones.  Good job.  She's getting her stuff.  She's cleaning up.  She's fixing her hair.  She's walking out the door.  There she goes.  Francine.  The only problem is, if you sell that CD, how do you get a rope and a stool into the package? 
[02:18:00]  Oh, boy.  All right.  Don't ever say Jim Norton brings nothing to the show and does no prep.  I brought you some comedy.  That was...  Thank you.  I found a hot new prospect.  That's pretty good.  I brought it.  Thank you, Jim.  Hey, hey.  Just remember, payback is a bitch.  I mean, thank you for bringing that into the show.  Hey, Sean.  Hey.  We made a huge mistake, my brother.  Yeah.  We went with Francine. 
[02:18:30]  We should have went with you on the whole world peace thing.  Dude, there's an hour and ten minutes of show.  The show's not over.  There's an hour and ten minutes left.  Sean?  Yeah.  He's cool, man.  We're running late, so we've got to take a break.  All right?  All right.  Okay.  Are you well prepared?  I'm well prepared.  Are you scripted, dude, or are you off the cuff?  Well, I have some scripting, but I'd rather just go over the concept of it.  I understand, but you know what?  The last segment, we rambled on a little bit, so make sure you...  No, not we.  She.  She.  We.  And, you know, we want to make sure you get right to the point and help us out here. 
[02:19:00]  We've got to bring some energy back to the show.  Yeah, I'll see what I can do.  All right.  All right.  And we're going to do that next, so hang in there, okay?  Yeah.  Sean talked about his idea about world peace, the dictaphone, and how the cops are doing  him wrong.  Right.  Because they've got rid of...  Evidence.  Evidence.  Yeah.  Sean, you're next, man.  All right.  Your debut on the Opie and Anthony show in a few minutes.  Stay there.  Sweet.  There goes Sean.  Okay.  Hey.  New York shock jocks Opie and Anthony are now on the air.  Welcome to the wonderful world of Balloon Not Pleasure. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, if you need lube, you're a loser.  Take it like a champ, okay?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Spreading like AIDS in Haiti.  Here, check it out, the O&A show today.  Rave reviews coming in for Francine.  Oh, yeah.  My God, the listeners, they loved it.  I haven't seen feedback like this in a long, long time, Francine.  Yes.  We got a couple A-holes out there that are trying to, you know, put you down and make you feel 
[02:20:00]  bad about your stuff.  But in general, the feedback is very positive, so.  Yep.  So, congrats, Francine.  We got naked girls all over the ball field today, Anthony.  This is like Mr. Rick is at work outside.  There's three or four girls outside getting their pictures done for the WOW Contest.  We'll have their photos up very soon.  We're getting close to the magic number of 100 contestants. 
[02:20:30]  One hundred chicks.  If we go a little over, that's okay, but we pretty much want to stop it at a hundred.  Did you just give an open door to keep this going any longer?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe that's what you were just saying.  I'm just saying, I think we're going to get a hundred contestants by tomorrow, so tomorrow  could be the last day to qualify.  How's that sound?  Very good.  All right, because if the ladies are on their way to the station tomorrow and we announce  a hundred, you know, you throw them in.  Okay?  We got 89 now.  We got three outside.  And then we got a bunch outside, so.  Yeah.  And the other stations, four outside and the other stations we're on, I mean, they got 
[02:21:00]  girls that supposedly there's like three girls in Albany that have showed up.  Oh, we'll hit a hundred.  And there's a girl from Buffalo.  Her pictures aren't up yet, I'm hearing.  Can you see the rack being photographed right now?  Yes.  That's why it's called the WOW Contest.  We got some nice racks outside.  Francine, congratulations.  Seriously.  All right.  Now it was good.  Smiling and waving.  Good.  It was good.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't even read the instant feedback.  How could you?  Because I couldn't for FCC rules.  I've never heard the C word used so much in my life. 
[02:21:30]  Two Gs in that word.  Two Gs in that word.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, this one preceded by dumb 2G word.  Oh, my God, you people.  Oh.  Someone's suggesting we should have brought in some LAPD cops while she was in here doing that.  Have you seen that clip?  I want to loop it to music and just dance the night away.  Someone's suggesting we have Francine's Week in Review. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Let me ask Francine if she'd be up for something like that.  Maybe get a subject to talk about.  Sure.  Francine.  Yo, Francine.  She went down the hall.  Yeah.  Dak?  Could you not call her Dak?  I saw that movie.  All right.  We'll get her back in here, Anthony.  She's running down the hall all excited.  She's coming back.  Come on in, Francine. 
[02:22:30]  Here she comes.  Yo, baby.  Francine.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  It's coming in like crazy.  People feel like you should go the current event route.  Current event?  Doing what?  Like...  Like you put together maybe like a Week in Review, they're saying.  I'll do that.  Sure.  Every week, you gather up some of the odd stories that slip through the cracks.  Do you watch the TV?  No.  She could give her spin on the big stories.  Oh, even the big stories?  Wow.  You're giving her a lot of responsibility there.  That's a lot of leeway there, G.H. 
[02:23:00]  You want to try to do a Week in Review?  Yeah.  I usually just listen to you guys.  I don't even watch TV, really.  Oh, you got your news from the O.P. and Anthony show?  Yeah.  Well, you might want to pick up a paper.  I'll do that.  No problem.  Watch like Tom Brokaw or something and, you know, and pick up on the big stories of the  day and then write a little Week in Review.  NBC Nightly News.  You know what I hate about black guys?  Their swan of longs are so much bigger than mine.  I'll do that.  Yeah.  You'll do that?  Yeah.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[02:23:30]  I'm joined this evening by Francine.  And you know what we were doing before tonight's broadcast?  We were knocking on see-through windows and running away.  As opposed to those windows you can't quite see through.  You did say see-through window, didn't you?  Yes, I did.  Because everybody wants to pretend they're on front.  Francine, don't defend your material.  I get it.  Yeah.  I understand the see-through window thing.  I rolled up some paper and I'm smoking it like a cigarette.  Look at me.  And now me and Francine are going to go to Delia's and I'm going to get a Cutie Pie shirt. 
[02:24:00]  A little shirt to Delia's that says, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, Cutie Pie.  Did you hate that?  Do you like my gray pieces of hair?  Yes, I do.  You do?  Yes.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I sure hate those black guys.  You know what I'm saying?  Do you know what I'm saying? 
[02:24:30]  Sometimes I say, you know what I'm saying?  After I say, you know what I'm saying?  That's what I hate about them.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  This could be some competition for me if Francine gets into the news business.  She seems to have a lot, a lot, a lot, plump, plump, plump, plump, plump, tons of insight.  On the ways of the world and done with a comic spin. 
[02:25:00]  Spinning so fast I can't even see it.  Yeah, why don't we do a week in review, okay?  All right, sure.  We'll do that maybe Monday.  How's that sound?  Yeah, I'll do that for Monday.  You've got until now and Monday to put a little week in review.  So you watch the news and you go, hey, the All-Star game was yesterday.  What's up with the All-Star?  And then you comment about it.  You editorialize the news.  I'm being ripped off.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  All right?  And it has to be comedic, though.  It can't just be just me.  Oh, it'll be funny. 
[02:25:30]  I hate everything, believe me.  Well, I was kind of getting that sense, so.  Yeah.  It'll be funny, right?  Sometimes you're sitting there wondering, all right, you know.  I hope it will be as funny as some of the stuff on the CD we just listened to.  Yes.  Right?  Yes, it'll be as funnier.  Oh, good.  Okay, it'll be funnier.  It'll be funnier.  As funnier.  Okay.  No, it'll be funnier because, you know, because the CD pretty much sucked.  I wouldn't say it sucked.  I would think it.  But, I wouldn't say it because you're nice, but it's probably just that it was, you don't 
[02:26:00]  forget there was no audience there.  Exactly.  Thank God.  I mean.  No, you've got to feed off the energy, so that's why we're going to have a week in review with  you.  You come in, and you'll feel the vibe in the room, and I think you're going to do a lot  better.  You know what I hate about Dan Rather?  Oh.  He's a f***ing f***ing sucker.  See, I can work bull, bull, bull, dirty, too.  All right, Francine.  Okay.  We don't want to burn you out, so why don't you leave the studio.  That's the first time.  That CD belongs in the tub. 
[02:26:30]  Here's, honk here's.  Francine, everybody.  There she goes.  Wait a minute.  That's amazing.  Oh, I can't wait.  I don't know if people are aware of this and just generalize it.  She's got two brain cells in her head having a tug of war.  There is something sociopathic in nature about a complete lack of ability to see things as  they are.  Do you understand?  How old is she? 
[02:27:00]  I don't know.  Does anyone know?  I'm not talking about her.  I was just asking.  Garrett just walks in.  She can hear you.  I'm talking about sociopaths.  Yes, you are.  Like David Bergowitz, who's up for parole, right?  Dude, he's up for parole.  He doesn't know how awful he is.  Yeah.  Dude, he has no idea how nobody wants to see or listen to him.  Right.  And yet, he is going to try for parole.  And it ain't going to work.  No.  Hey, we got... 
[02:27:30]  He stinks.  Hey, can we do some current news ourselves here?  We're trying to segue into it.  Like half of our WOW contestants.  They're smart.  Who shows you a bad news?  Okay, Anthony.  Yes.  Big story coming out of Hollywood.  Rehab for ex-Baywatch Hunk.  Former Baywatch star David Hasselhoff has reached out for a life preserver, checking himself  into the Betty Ford Center for Treatment of Alcoholism.  The 49-year-old curly-haired hunk has been at the Rancho Mirage Treatment Center since June 26th. 
[02:28:00]  Hoffman said Hasselhoff will be at the Center for the Rich and Addicted for as long as it takes to beat the bottle.  He has a little drinking problem, Anthony.  A little drinking problem.  A little drinking problem.  He realizes social drinking had increased more than he was comfortable with, and he decided  to do something about it.  Hasselhoff had been at the Betty Ford Center in early June, but went AWOL after a few days,  according to a published report. 
[02:28:30]  So, yes, I'm sorry.  David Hasselhoff nearly dies in booze-soaked overdose.  He may watch out for those drinks.  Apparently, he drained the minibar?  Yeah, this is the best part of the story.  Hours after leaving the center, Hasselhoff was rushed to Eisenhower Medical Center in Palm Desert, California,  after drinking himself unconscious in a hotel room, according to reports. 
[02:29:00]  A guard found Hasselhoff out cold on the floor of his room after he drank all the alcohol in his minibar.  The actor was treated for alcohol poisoning.  Oh, my God.  Let's see what he had.  Three bottles of Sky Vodka, three bottles of Tanqueray Gin, two bottles of Bacardi Rum, two bottles of Cognac,  not to mention several bottles of beer and wine. 
[02:29:30]  And the tab for the minibar alone, $170.  That's when they found him on the floor.  What kind of a drunken ass, Anthony, would abuse a minibar like that?  Hey, I still leave some stuff in there.  I'll never touch the Cognac.  We got some David Hasselhoff music we want to get to in a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  He's good.  Michael, leave the driving to me, Michael.  Put it on autopilot. 
[02:30:00]  Shut up, Kit.  I'm fine.  I was the star of Baywatch.  Sorry.  Put that beep in there.  There we go.  You.  There.  All that for that.  Michael.  Michael, pull over.  My sensors are detecting a high blood alcohol level.  Shut it up, your f***ing exhaust pipe.  Michael, slow down. 
[02:30:30]  F*** you.  Michael, put the bottle down.  Michael.  Michael.  There's a Tanqueray mini bottle stuck under my gas pedal.  Drive through the park, Kit.  You know how I always loved the park.  Michael, I'm out of gas.  Could you f*** in my gas tank?  Michael 
[02:31:00]  Set my controls  And I'll drop you right up Pam Anderson  Michael how drunk have you been  During our friendship  You know you're talking to a car  Oh  You mean you're not a talking car 
[02:31:30]  Michael  Three rights make a left Michael  Where's my box of wine  He's taking the knife out of the cheese  Do you think he wants some cheese  How about brisket  I think now I should go to the hospital  Housekeeping 
[02:32:00]  You fill up my minibar  You Spanish  Oh my god  I didn't say anything bad  I was a big singing star  In  Germany  Is this a Knight Rider song?  A David Hasselhoff original?  Yes  Wow I need a drink 
[02:32:30]  Yeah  I bring an ice cast everywhere  Oh god  Man what a show  Oh  And I'm really right  Yeah  Don't the feelings show  Oh  A couple of cold ones  Don't the feelings show  Torture

[02:35:00]  Well, I'm up, I'll do what I want  I don't know if he lost his vowels, did he? 
[02:35:30]  20 on a clip  Yeah, wait, what?  Ah  David Hasselhoff having some problems  Did he really say, ain't the moon a beauty?  Oh, you were listening to the music? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, boy, is he  We were just trying to sneak in some clips there  Dude, that could be the worst song I've ever heard  No, there's a whole album full of them  I mean, that would be like comedy  Yeah  Does, yeah  Does he get a  He did a remake of some song?  Oh, we don't have that one?  I just want to hear a piece of a remake  It ain't the moon a beauty  Like, that's his original  What's crazy about him?  What song is this, Rick?  Do You Love Me 
[02:36:30]  He just wrote that  The Do You Love Me?  Yeah  The old 60s one  Oh  Do you love that one?  You broke my heart  Because I couldn't dance  No wonder he's drinking  He didn't even walk me around  Around  Wish somebody put this retard out of his misery  To let you know  That stupid voice  I really shake him down  Do You Love Me?  I can really know 
[02:37:00]  Yeah  Woo  That's great  Shut up, dummy  Watch me now  Watch me now  That's great  David Hasselhoff  Godspeed, Dave  Do well in rehab  Can we talk about Ted Williams' head  For a few minutes?  Please  Can I hear the daughter's quote again? 
[02:37:30]  Oh, of course  This is unbelievable  One of my favorites  The latest headline on Fox  Wacko Jacko  No, something about  Oh, man  His body going to court  Going to court?  The family and his body going to court  To see if they're going to burn him or freeze him  Will it be fire or will it be ice for Ted Williams?  God, we are so getting back to the swing of things in this country, aren't we?  Yeah  This is like the big, big news 
[02:38:00]  Look at the covers of the paper  We have Wacko Jacko  Here in New York  And let's freeze dad  Battle over Ted Williams' body  And here's what the daughter has to say about that  He said, well, you know  We don't have to freeze his whole body  We can freeze his head  You're like you  And they're discussing this as a serious news item on all the news stations  And don't you just picture his big, frozen Ted Williams' head? 
[02:38:30]  They froze his whole body so far, but hopefully  Have they really frozen his body?  Yes, he is in liquid nitrogen  The latest they want to bring his body back in a hundred years  In a hundred years  They're going to clone him and he's going to play baseball again or something?  Come on  Come on  What, we have audio of Ted Williams' defreezing process?  Yeah  Oh  This is our celebrity vault  Attention, stage one 
[02:39:00]  Laser cutting begins  Laser cutting complete  Stage two  Warm liquid goo phase beginning  Okay  Warm liquid goo phase complete  Stage three 
[02:39:30]  Reanimation beginning  Reanimation complete  And then what?  And then Ted's fine again  And then he's fine  That's what happens  He's playing baseball as a head  Well  It would have to be his whole body  Yeah  If they freeze his whole body and bring it back  You'll see him out on the baseball field  200 years from now  He comes strutting out of the dugout  Yeah, baby  There it is 
[02:40:00]  Ted Williams  Up to bat  That one  Towering high fly ball  It is gone  As Ted Williams makes his way around the baseless  Oh, no  Is his head  Falling off of his body?  Of course not  Here's Ted Williams walking to the plate  For his first appearance after being cloned 
[02:40:30]  The Iceman cometh  Really?  Yeah  Is he going to call himself the Iceman?  Some people get those nicknames in baseball, you know?  The Iceman  I imagine if he comes back as a head, Anthony  There's going to be a lot of head jokes  Right  Not a good time to lose one's head  Indeed  That's not the way to get a head in life  No  It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong  He'll never be the head of a major corporation  That's just cruel 
[02:41:00]  Poor guy trying to give it a shot after a hundred or so years  His pals are so pissed off  This John Henry guy too  Of course  His son's a monster  He's trying to make a Frankenstein  When Ted was alive  I think he put it in his will  Or he told his friends  You know  He wants a proper burial or whatever  Very private  As a matter of fact  He didn't even want a memorial service  Yeah, he just wanted to be cremated  And his ashes thrown over the ocean  Down there in Florida  Yeah  Instead  His son wants to freeze his head 
[02:41:30]  For all  Freezer in Arizona  That's hilarious  I know  That's where they go down there  That's where they freeze everybody  That's where you get your curmudgeon  Arizona  Here's the doctor after he unfrozed Ted there  Oh, right  You've been cryogenically frozen for 30 years  Oh, no  Only 30?  Rick, he has to be put back for 70 more years  Ted's son really is an ass  Oh, yeah  The guy is  His friends were saying that  Either he believes  He doesn't want his father to be dead 
[02:42:00]  Or he's just trying to capitalize financially  On selling Ted Williams' DNA  And cloning Ted Williams  But the technology isn't there  But how is he going to sell the DNA?  Because DNA is very tiny  DNA, people  We did that bit yesterday  I know  Okay  I know we're struggling  But we did that yesterday  Okay  We can talk about Eddie Van Halen's divorce in a second  But the DNA is so tiny 
[02:42:30]  So they've got to figure out another way to package it  Well, no  You can't just hand out empty little jars  And say, yeah, there's some DNA in there  You can put in tissue samples  Or little slides full of fluid  Anything with DNA in it  And then who knows  Two hundred years from now  A whole team of Ted Williams leaves the dugout  Groove into the bases  Yeah  Can I hear the daughter's clip again? 
[02:43:00]  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body  We can freeze his head  That's the most gruesome thing  He's now part of a monster movie  Ted Williams, who played ball, earned some money  He's a great baseball legend  He wanted to be private  And now he's part of a goddamn monster movie  No, he's part of like an Ed Wood movie  Todd from Buffalo  Wondering if Ted Williams has that Han Solo look on his face 
[02:43:30]  When Han was frozen in the carbonite  I'd be Williams  Alright, what happened in Vanilla Sky?  A movie I haven't seen  But now it's obvious that it has something to do with a head  Or cloning  Or freezing a body  Because every freaking day  Someone's saying he could be in Vanilla Sky  I thought the movie was pretty good  It was good  Yeah, but I  It was pretty good  It took like a weird turn that I wasn't expecting  I'll say  But it has something to do with a head  Or being frozen  Or cloning  Because  Why every day 
[02:44:00]  I don't want to ruin it  I don't want to ruin it  It's ruined for me  Well, it probably is ruined  Yeah  Don't worry  Because someone will ruin it for you  On instant feedback  I saw it already  Me too  I enjoyed it  Bastards ruined six cents for me  That was a good picture  Yeah, it was  It was pretty good  Hey, can I have the post?  We've got one more story to do  Sure, Angel  Unless we want to do a little more Ted Williams head jokes  Tomato  Thank you  You're welcome  Is this Ted singing? 
[02:44:30]  I don't know  He's leading the chorus  Ted's leading the chorus  I don't think it's Ted  Is it Ted?  The chiro  Yeah  The what?  The cryo  Cryo  Did you say chiro?  Yeah, I did  Yeah, it's an Egyptian  Yeah, I know  Thanks for noticing  Chirogenics  That I effed up again  Thank you  No, really, thanks  He's frozen and his nose has been shot off  All right  That's funny  Thank you  British soldier humor  Elbow  Elbow  Glad I could set you up on that one 
[02:45:00]  You sure did  Boy George, Anthony  Yeah  Is still itching for a fight  Would you mess with this guy?  Yes  Boy George?  You wouldn't mess with Boy George?  You're insane  That heroin down fag?  Yeah, I would  He's got his ass together again  Oh, yeah  He's a real tough guy  He comes from a fighting background  Oh, stop it  Really?  The 80's icon  Who recently made headlines  For punching out a staffer  At a London gay club  Is questioning the sexuality  Of macho popsters  Eminem and Robbie Williams 
[02:45:30]  This is what he says about that  Where do I fit in?  Robbie Williams  Oh  Boy George contends that  Eminem is far too pretty  To be straight  Telling Australian  Gay men's mag DNA  That any man who cares  That much about his looks  Has to be queer  Goes on to say  I'd F him just to hurt him  Oh  That's hot  Oh, wait  No, it isn't  Yeah, no, it isn't  You think Boy George 
[02:46:00]  Can kick some ass?  Yeah, I think so  Yeah  I don't know about that  Gay magazine called DNA  Make up your own joke  Yep  I didn't even notice  That was a gay magazine  Damn, Nancy's again  DNA  What  Gay people want to fit in  A little more  Why?  Why are you calling  Your gay men's magazine  DNA  When that is obviously  A slang for splooge  Glue on the back 
[02:46:30]  Would have had more dignity  London gay men  Hmm  Yeah  All right  We're going to break Anthony  Oh, there it is  Ted Williams' face  On the Vanilla Sky poster  You've got to see the movie  For that to be funny  That's great  Before it gets ruined for you  Is Tom Cruise going to be 
[02:47:00]  In like some weird  UFO spaceship  Under the water  For a thousand years  No  He gets disfigured  You know  Staring at something  In the movie  He's disfigured  It's good  But it's not like  Sixth Sense  Where he's dead  Through the whole movie  Yeah, you get to see  His good looking  His good looks are still there  He's cryogenically frozen  Through half the movie  Yeah  And you find out later  Because he's yelling  Out a girl's name  But it's just the name  Of the company  Yeah  So he's been in this  Freezing process  For half the movie  And he's just having  This lucid dream 
[02:47:30]  They call it  During the movie  Kind of a rip-off  Of Total Recall  In a certain way  About the man  Coming in  Right, right  So most of the movie  That you're seeing him in  After that point  Where he falls down  On the street  And pretty much  Gives up hope  From that point on  It is 200 years  In the future  And he is just dreaming  All this  He never saw the girl again  Yeah  Did you just ruin  The movie for me  Oh, yeah  Completely  Completely  And totally  Yeah, completely  Maybe you can watch  Something else  Other than Vanilla Sky  Ah, rent something else  Yeah  How about Q&A  Which I've been recommending  For two years 
[02:48:00]  And neither one of you  Humps will get  Nick Nolte film  Take my advice  Sorry  I thought you wanted to  You said  How does it end  No  I thought you said that too  Then he's given the choice  To either kill himself  And be dead  Or continue the dream  So he jumps off the building  Which means he wants  To go back to life  Yeah, he wants to  Come back to life  At the end  Because they can bring him  Back to life  Because he's been frozen  And he says goodbye  To the girl  On the building roof  Yeah  But I mean  You really missed much  I mean people see it  No  It's well acted  There's some cool graphics  Yeah 
[02:48:30]  Do you at least see  This stuff coming?  No  No, not at all  It's a complete surprise ending  I was like  I didn't know what was happening  Until five minutes  To the end of the movie  And I'm like  Oh, finally  All the ends are tied up  He's been cryogenically frozen  Ever since he  Fell in the street  What was the girl's name  He kept yelling  L-E  L-E  L-E  Letters L-E  Yeah, L-E  Life Extension  It was Life Extension  It was the cryogenics  But you're hearing L-E  Like it's a girl named L-E  Yeah  But it was just a play on words  Cleverly written  And perfectly disguised 
[02:49:00]  I didn't see it coming  Until I saw it  I'm like, oh my god  I didn't see it coming at all  Is that what that was?  Mm-hmm  Who the heck knew that was coming?  I will say  It threw me for a loop  Who's the doctor?  But rent it anyway  It's  Yeah  Cinematography  The cinematography  Is fantastic  I thought it was well shot  Yeah  The cameraman was excellent  Good, excellent score  Well directed  Dr. Evil, yes  Great  I want to come back in time  And steal  Ted Williams' Moju

Carmen Diaz  Yeah, Cameron Diaz  She's seeing Tom Cruise  And then she crashes the car with him in it  Yeah  And you're not sure if he's dead or not  Right  And then he meets this girl  And that's when he's disfigured  And the whole thing  You know, it's supposed to be like a big twist  Yeah, right up to the end  I didn't see it coming at all  But I mean  I mean, I'm not trying to ruin it for anybody  You can still watch it  It's well done  Oh, Paul from Centery  I'm sorry  Please, I enjoyed Titanic  I knew what happened at the end  Right, the boat sinks  Yeah  Ooh  Ooh, get mad  Yeah, you bunch of  Relax
