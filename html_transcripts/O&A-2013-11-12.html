<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts' characteristically vulgar banter about the New York City weather, quickly transitioning to a protracted complaint about persistent phone problems.  Mars, an in-studio employee, attempts to explain the technical difficulties, stemming from a Windows 7 installation error and the ensuing bureaucratic nightmare of navigating corporate email chains and absurdly detailed questionnaires to obtain a software patch.  The hosts satirize this corporate inefficiency with sarcastic and highly offensive language.

The show then dives into a news roundup, covering a fatal accident on a woman's birthday, a triple homicide committed by a former member of the Iranian band Yellow Dogs, and the racially charged statements of a 16-year-old shooter in a Bryant Park incident.  Amy Robach's breast cancer diagnosis and a possible stabbing involving Junior Gotti are also briefly discussed.  The phone issues resurface, further fueling their frustration with corporate bureaucracy, interspersed with vulgar commentary and a digression about Mark-Paul Gosselaar and his acting career.

The next segment begins with a mocking discussion of "Saved by the Bell," focusing on the characters' fashion and speculating about Screech's later life, leading to a minor disagreement with Mars about the television channel.  The hosts then announce upcoming guests: Tom Papa (referred to derisively) and Mike Buschetti (highly praised).  They also mention Mike Tyson's upcoming appearance the following day, expressing excitement about his autobiography and HBO documentary, along with a lengthy discussion about his abandoned mansion, illustrated with various photos.

The conversation then shifts to Neil Young's birthday, triggering a discussion about his music and a host's negative experience with a Neil Young-obsessed girlfriend. This leads to a discussion about their personal relationships and their designated sexual partners, followed by the playing and discussion of various Neil Young, Pearl Jam, and Indio songs.  Anthony then showcases his drunken karaoke videos on YouTube, featuring Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains songs, eliciting mixed reactions from the hosts and others in the studio. The focus then shifts to Mike Buschetti's Instagram account, particularly his short, abruptly-cut videos promoting his web series, "Tubby Man," which the hosts dissect at length.  This segment concludes with more photos of Mike Tyson's abandoned mansion, additional discussion of Buschetti's social media, a shared anecdote about a severe toothache, a brief mention of an upcoming event and a friend's death, and a discussion about an abandoned Disney resort building.  The show ends by looking at the "Abandoned Picks" Twitter account.

The next segment begins with continued discussion of abandoned places, including a futuristic-looking house in Pennsylvania, a doll factory, and Disney's River Country water park.  This segues into a discussion about tree houses, inspired by a Discovery Channel show, and the hosts jokingly brainstorm building their own elaborate tree houses.  Tom Papa joins the show, discussing his move to Los Angeles and his new National Geographic show, described as "Jackass meets Mythbusters."  He recounts some of his stunts, including dropping a bubble-wrapped stuntman and stacking a pickup truck on coffee mugs, along with the logistical and legal challenges involved.  A video of a DNA test revealing a white supremacist's sub-Saharan African ancestry is played, sparking a humorous, sometimes heated discussion. Mike Buschetti later joins, and the conversation shifts to his shaving rash, the heights of the Freedom Tower and Willis Tower, Blockbuster's closing, skyscraper window cleaning, and Tom Papa's TV show and podcast, including a story about a difficult interview with Tim Conway.

The following segment features Mike Buschetti discussing his brother’s death, his emotional reaction (while acknowledging he was drinking), and a story about his brother’s late wake-up call causing his tardiness for the show.  The conversation meanders to his experiences with wasabi, his surprisingly positive view of firearms ownership in New York, a near-jaw-breaking incident with a shotgun, his weight loss, and his dietary shift from fast food to sushi. He shares his views on the New York City mayoral election, his dislike for the city's bike-sharing program, and a confrontation with a pedicab driver.  Concerns about the new mayor's potential impact on the NYPD and crime rates are also discussed. The conversation moves to bullying, prompted by NFL controversies, leading Buschetti to share childhood bullying experiences, including nicknames, pranks, and strategies for avoiding chores. He connects his experiences to online bullying and promotes "Tubby Man," his superhero web series featuring a large protagonist who fights bullies.  The series' premise, characters (including Donnell Rawlings as his father), and visual style ("Teenage Mutant Gangbanger") are described, alongside mention of a PSA against bullying.  The conversation is punctuated by numerous off-color jokes and sexually suggestive comments.

The next excerpt focuses on promoting "Tubby Man," with clips showcasing bullying, a romantic subplot, and fantasy sequences.  The conversation frequently becomes sexually explicit, detailing Buschetti's sexual fantasies, preferences, and casual sex experiences.  His weight loss attempts are discussed, and Nick Cannon joins as a surprise guest.  The conversation with Cannon covers his family life with Mariah Carey, views on race, career, and dealing with his children.  Cannon's distinctive outfit is noted, and a comedic advertisement for Steven Singer Jewelers features Buschetti improvising vulgar lines.  The hosts interject with frequent vulgar and offensive comments.

The final segment features Mike Buschetti, starting with listener calls requesting contact information and details on sending Christmas presents to him and Artie Lange.  He discusses receiving unusual fan mail, including a Babe Ruth autograph replica.  The Richie Incognito bullying scandal is discussed, with Buschetti expressing conflicting views.  His dating life is covered, including humorous anecdotes about past relationships, specifically one with a virginal Nebraska farmer's daughter.  His social media presence and upcoming comedy shows (with Dave Hill and on Artie Lange's show) are promoted. The segment ends with shout-outs to sponsors (including Tubby Man and BulliesKeepOut.com) and thank-yous to Nick Cannon and Mike Buschetti.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy...  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's the dang open-handed, don't listen to the dang open...  Stop!  Stop with that shit!  I know, here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  It's freezing up again. 
[00:01:00]  Hi!  Hey, look at that.  There we are. Good morning, everyone.  Yeah.  Fucking cold in New York City.  Oh.  Windy in New York City.  This is the big transition, I guess.  Yeah!  To crappy, cold, wintery weather. 
[00:01:30]  We did alright, though.  Yeah, not too shabbly.  November 12th, without any real issues.  Weather-wise, we did alright.  Yeah.  I'll take this.  I like how the weather, boy, they love talking about snow, regardless of if it's going to  happen or not.  Right.  Snow for the area?  We'll let you know.  And then they talk about these areas that start snowing in, like, July, anyway.  It's like, but upstate New York, you know?  Which is part of the viewing audience.  Yeah, yeah, it's the same thing.  They get to hear. 
[00:02:00]  But they trick us into it, thinking that we're part of that snow thing.  Snow for our area!  Well, you know what you need to do?  You need to live in western New York for one winter.  You'll never bitch about winter again.  I hear it's deplorable, as they say.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  I want no part of that.  It is absolutely ridiculous up there, how cold it gets.  Single digits for weeks on end.  Lots and lots of snow.  The snow doesn't melt.  It never really melts.  That's some crazy shit.  It melts a little bit, but then the new stuff comes, and you don't see the grass until, I 
[00:02:30]  don't know, like April.  Oh, it's okay.  There's no clouds in the sky.  I don't think it's going to snow.  Oh, that's right.  It's some monstrous thing where it comes off the lake.  Lake effect snow.  It just doesn't even need clouds.  It just comes off the lake.  Lake effect snow could be the biggest pain in the ass ever.  You go out to your car every morning and have to dust it off with your little brush.  I want no part.  And then you jump in your car for lunch.  That fluffy shit.  And then you've got to drive home. 
[00:03:00]  I can't pull out a fucking ice scrape without thinking of poor Jerry Lundergaard in Fargo.  Just losing his mind after Wade fucked him over.  We don't really use ice scrapers in this area.  Not a lot.  No.  Up there, man.  If you leave your house with an ice scraper, you're a dummy.  Yeah.  Because then you have to do the old school cassette tape.  Remember the cassette tapes you would use as an ice scraper?  I've become a pro over the years at using anything to scrape it. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, the cassette case.  Or if you didn't even have the case, sometimes you'd have to sacrifice a tape you didn't really like.  Right.  Oh, fuck.  What the fuck?  Simon and Garfunkel.  Yeah, what the fuck?  I was emotional when I got this.  I'm not emotional anymore.  Abba.  Hey, I liked my Abba break yesterday.  Abba was great.  That fucking, that Waterloo song did not leave my head from the moment we walked out of the studio.  Dude, this morning, as I'm plugging in my computer here, I'm like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[00:04:00]  I can't fucking stop it.  It's happy white people music.  I woke up the first thing in my head when I woke up.  I'm getting clothes out of the closet.  Oh, da-da-da-da-da.  I think it's too late for their reunion, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I was listening to other radio yesterday, and everyone's talking about it.  Yeah.  As this big, huge thing.  But their last album came out in 1982.  82.  And they're not going to be all sexy and shit on that stage anymore, which kind of was part of the whole thing. 
[00:04:30]  That was part of the allure, wasn't it?  Right.  The legs and the little short skirts.  And the heinies that would kind of stick out a little bit once you bent over too far.  Exactly.  I don't know.  What are you going to do?  You guys want to start with some house cleaning?  What do we got?  Or what do you call it?  Like some of the shit going on around here?  Oh, yeah.  I just heard a piece of this.  And it's great.  Well, we've had a phone issue for about a week. 
[00:05:00]  Well, it's been happening a lot longer than a week.  But finally, we're trying to get it fixed.  And Tim Sabian, who's now in charge, I have confidence in the guy.  But I see that he's already in the mud.  In the mud.  He's stuck in the mud, meaning this place.  And then Don Wicklund, who's now working for the channel again.  Did you know that?  I found that out.  Don Wicklund is back.  Recently.  What's he doing?  He's helping out.  He's one of Tim's guys now. 
[00:05:30]  Tim's getting the staff together.  I like dandy Don Wicklund.  So Don's back.  He's like, oh, fuck that.  I'll get this fixed immediately.  Well, Don Wicklund is also in the mud.  He's also in the mud, meaning this place.  It has nothing to do with Don Wicklund and his efforts or Tim Sabian and his efforts.  So Mars is in studio with an explanation.  He really sucks on the radio.  But hopefully we'll be able to work through this.  Good morning, guys.  So tell these guys what you told me when I first got here. 
[00:06:00]  So there's some kind of issue with the phones.  It's like a timeout error.  And if you click OK, because it tells you, look, you're having a timeout error.  So you go, OK, and you click that, and then the phones just disappear.  And then you've got to go through this whole fucking process thing to get them back.  A rigmarole.  Right.  Well, ever since they installed the Windows 7, the associated producer...  Yawn! 
[00:06:30]  Well, because of that, the phones have a runtime error.  They have a clash somewhere.  OK, well, you understand.  We have a runtime error.  That's all that people need to know.  So Don has a patch that they use in D.C.  Over his eye.  He's a pirate.  Sorry for smoking.  So there's a patch.  And there's palapesia.  It's a fix.  It's a fix for the runtime error.  OK.  And they use it with success down in D.C. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Beautiful.  So let's do it here in New York.  So then Don was very cool, and he sent it to me.  So I sent it forward to IT.  OK.  So it's just a basic patch.  Here, we've had this issue in Washington.  We know this patch will take care of the issue in New York.  Here you go.  Cool.  Shouldn't that be the end of it?  You know how easy it is when you have a program that's a little buggy, and then they send a patch, and you're like, oh, a patch.  Nice.  And then it's like, installing, installed, good.  There.  Done.  You said it to Ike Turner.  What happened?  Right.  What happened is six pages of emails happened. 
[00:07:30]  Six pages of email.  OK.  Six pages.  This is the problem with corporate America.  That's why I bring this up.  Why is it six pages of email?  I sent it to the guy, the IT here, Joe something.  Joe something got the patch thing, saying, hey, this patch is going to work, and you're representing us.  So you're like, look, I got a solution.  Here it is.  Boom.  Boom.  So you're going through some kind of proper channel.  So then he turns around and asks me two basic questions.  One is, is the attached self-  Are you a legal immigrant in this country? 
[00:08:00]  What qualifies you to do this professionally?  So he asks me if this is an executable file.  One.  And then secondly, the second question is a real weird question, because he says, is this change?  Big as your cock.  Exactly.  Are you more length or girth?  Are you putting them both in quotes?  Let's discuss this further in the bathroom.  Exactly.  So he's asking me, will this change be applied to all the PCs running AP in New York? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, boy.  In New York.  You're asking me.  The entire city is like millions and millions of people.  So I started.  Well, the many he made in the New York facility.  Of course he did.  Yeah.  The many he made in the New York facility.  Yeah, but you're not responsible for any of that.  Exactly.  You're responsible for it, old Jim.  But you're responsible for this studio, and we got a solution, so that's all this should be about.  Well, I started writing back, you know, very sarcastically, you know, it's above my pay grade, whatever,  all this.  Sarcasm goes great in corporate emails, by the way.  No, no, it doesn't.  I stopped.  Oh.  I corrected myself, and I said, well, if this is a solution for a common problem here in 
[00:09:00]  New York, why not?  Go ahead and do so.  Uh-oh.  But I'm not the person to say yay or nay.  Mars, all of a sudden, says, yes, let it roll in all of the New York computers.  Let it roll.  Let it ride.  If the EXE question is an executable file, is that a good question?  That's a good question, because it could be a virus.  That is a good question.  An EXE file can be a really dangerous thing.  It's coming from another employee in the company.  Right.  An IT guy.  But could that be corrupted without, maybe they're thinking it could be corrupted without  the guy knowing it.  So maybe that's the only legit question. 
[00:09:30]  Fair enough.  I guess there's, you know, you have to ask a little, for a little more info.  But, I mean, look at all the paperwork he's got in front of him.  For a run timer.  Go ahead.  So then, in the chain, he adds, I guess, his supervisor.  And he gets on the supervisor, and he tells me that a ticket needs to be created for this.  A ticket?  Right.  Which has been created prior to all this.  What's a ticket for the people out there?  I don't know.  Like a work order.  A work order.  Okay.  Okay.  So then he starts, I don't know who he really is trying to, you know, berate here. 
[00:10:00]  A berate?  Now there's some berating going on.  All right.  Nice.  If it's determined that a new version of software, regardless of which software it is, required to correct an issue.  Is the word beaner in there?  That could give me an idea of what he's, who he's trying to get to.  Then a certification ticket needs to be placed with engineering.  Okay?  So now I've got to place a certification ticket with engineering.  Now, I don't know what a certification ticket is.  I know what a ticket is, but what's a certification ticket? 
[00:10:30]  And then this is a well-established process for the distribution software to corporate machines that needs to be followed.  We do not distribute software through email.  Please do not forward executables to people telling them to run them.  Oh.  See?  He's calling you an idiot.  Because what he's saying is, look, you want to give this out.  We don't just email executables because we don't know what they could be.  They're viruses.  Is it an EXE file?  Uh, it is, but it isn't. 
[00:11:00]  Don has a workaround, and he explains it to us, you know.  Okay, keep going, keep going.  Oh, my God.  So then after that, they have the work order number, and now they have people coming down to go ahead and look at our problem.  Beautiful.  Okay.  All right.  Cool.  So that should have been done.  So the first time the individual comes, he comes about 3, 3.30.  After Rana Fez, because you need the studio, you know.  Right, but they can't get into the studio.  Right.  Okay.  It's locked?  No.  It's being used. 
[00:11:30]  At 3.30?  Yes.  At 3.30?  By Rana Fez.  At 3.30?  Yes.  Were they recording something?  Well, they do it.  By, uh, you guys, uh, yeah, they, uh, they use this room as a production room.  Oh.  All right.  Okay.  Keep going.  So then, you guys keep asking me.  So, uh, so then, uh, the guy comes back, he can't get in, and eventually, but did they  know he was trying to get in to fix a phone issue? 
[00:12:00]  Or they were in the middle of something, they probably didn't even know he was trying to get in.  I believe he addressed him.  I, I'm not, I'm not sure.  He, he said that he couldn't get in.  He said they, they told him to come back.  So he comes back.  Um, and then when he does come back, that's like at, uh, let's see.  And two hours later, two hours later, he comes back.  Then Don gets on the chain and says, hey, any update?  Okay.  This is like testimony.  I like this.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  All right.  So now, remember when I said he sucks on the radio?  Okay.  That's good. 
[00:12:30]  Okay.  But I like this whole.  It's a bit wordy.  Very legal and very documented.  Mars is trying to give all the facts.  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to do.  Mars is just giving the report.  Keep going.  The report is boring, not Mars.  Thank you, Jim.  You're welcome.  There you go.  I should have said in addition to it.  All right, keep going.  So at 9.07 last night.  9.07 last night.  Good time.  Okay.  This all started yesterday, of course, at the first email that I sent out at 10.47.  Why not at 10 o'clock? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  What are you doing for that?  Well, I first of all, why not at 9 o'clock?  Let me tell you that.  Before I do any of this, I have to make sure that all my T's are crossed and my I's are dotted.  So I got to make sure that the fucking wind is blowing right.  I was chipping golf balls.  I got McDonald's out of my lawn.  All right.  What were you doing for those minutes?  I got McDonald's.  I came back.  Me and Kato ate.  And then I shipped some golf balls.  What's that?  So I got to test everything in my environment in the studio. 
[00:13:30]  Make sure everything's good.  Sure.  So by that time, I figured out it's not my problem.  It's an IT problem.  Okay.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  Please.  So then at 9 o'clock, the guy says, I visited the studio and I was not able to reproduce the  era.  Oh.  Now.  That's very important.  I want to choke this dude, right?  Because you're not going to reproduce the era because you don't have the number of callers  that are doing the show.  He's not doing the show.  It's got to be a practical application thereof where, you know, you're taking phone calls 
[00:14:00]  and that's when it fucks up.  He needs water because he's got dry mouth.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's like listening to the fucking, somebody who works in a medical marijuana dispenser.  I wish his back was getting a little dry.  So wait, Mark.  Why does he need to reproduce the era just to see if that's what it is?  Oh, that's, I understand that could be protocol.  Well, it's like when you bring that car into the mechanic and you go, it does this every  time, but now it's not doing it. 
[00:14:30]  The mechanic goes, I don't know what to tell you.  What do you do if you say, look, the engine smokes what I'm doing above 60 miles an hour?  Right.  Does he take it out and go 60 or did he go, let me fix it?  Right.  Well, he might just know what it is.  Yeah, he might know.  Or he might have to take it out on the road and then figure it out and see it happen for  himself.  So you're trying to say here, which I like, is we have a phone problem because we get  so many phone calls.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Absolutely.  I thought we sucked.  I thought we weren't doing our jobs.  I thought.  You know whose phones don't have this problem? 
[00:15:00]  Art Bell.  Oh.  Because, you know, he doesn't get calls.  Well, he doesn't get anything around here anymore.  Well, because he, you know.  His run at Sirius XM is officially over.  How did that get fucked up?  The great Art Bell.  He was very angry that he wasn't getting phone calls, first of all.  Because unlike us, he doesn't put up with shit.  Yeah.  Did he have a phone issue?  You fucking...  See, we just talk a good game and never do anything about it.  And Art Bell, he's like, fuck this, and just says, I'm leaving. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And then he knows in his mind that he'll figure it out someday.  Yeah.  That's the difference.  Is that what happened?  Was it like technical issues and stuff that fucking chased the line?  It was all the issues we have.  He hates the app.  He...  The phone calls.  What were the issues?  His audience...  He wasn't getting...  Enough phone calls.  Enough phone calls.  Because you can't just pop on this platform and have the same audience you had on regular  radio.  Oh, okay.  Maybe that was...  And he's so caller-based that it was definitely affecting his show.  But he wasn't...  Like, you know, Art Bell would do it with Michio Kaku, which I first heard him, or Richard 
[00:16:00]  Hoagland.  I think he felt he wasn't talking to anybody.  Okay.  Especially with the online aspect fucked up.  He knew that he couldn't get international and, you know...  All right.  Well, maybe Art Bell gave up a little too fast then.  Maybe that's an Art Bell problem.  It's like, you know what, dude?  Give it some time.  He was frustrated with the online app, and...  I heard he was going to have his fucking alien friends blow up the fucking satellites  to this motherfucker.  Yes.  You don't quit after a fucking month, Art.  What do you expect?  Who do you think you are?  I really gave it my all. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I mean, in fairness to the company, you've got to fucking build up a little bit  more of an audience and talk to some of these people for hours and hours and hours,  and then your shows will get online and people will come.  Relax.  The truck drivers stop calling after a while.  They sure do.  They're replaced by, you know, real people.  I'm kidding, truckers.  Shut up.  Y'all kicked the fucking...  No, I'm kidding.  Go ahead, Mars.  I'm glad you see these people.  So we're a brilliant show with a lot of phone calls, and that's why this happens.  Right.  So he came...  I heard you loud and clear.  All right.  Keep going.  He says, this is pretty much I can do, because I believe the early email from Matt, Matt, 
[00:17:00]  from that individual, Matt So-and-so, stated that the installable file should be provided  to engineering for testing and deployment.  I don't know which...  Wow.  Now we're deploying people.  Where?  To the Philippines?  You know what?  Some umbrellas.  Obama's not going to be happy about this.  Deployment.  So we're trying to get our fucking troops home.  Let's go.  Okay, so...  So then he says, lastly, that the installable file is not attached. 
[00:17:30]  It really...  It was initially with the Don Wickland, but I guess as you forward it, it disappears or  whatever.  It fucking fell off?  Yeah.  It fell off the email.  Right.  An executable file somewhere.  Yes.  Furthermore, his boss said they shouldn't be sent out via email anyway.  Exactly.  So he got that part.  Crazy danger.  Now his own worker is asking for it via email.  Anyhow, so in the last line, he says, this is the kicker now.  Can you provide engineering the data they require to process a certification install request? 
[00:18:00]  So I need your guys...  Certification install request.  What does that mean?  So I need your guys' help.  Wait, what does that mean?  We have to fill out a questionnaire.  We have to fill out a questionnaire to get a patch that they know works.  I provide you with a copy.  He's got fucking hands out.  This is great.  Take one, pass it down.  This is a pop quiz.  Oh, thank you.  Ten questions.  What time-wasting shit. 
[00:18:30]  This is fucking corporate bureaucracy in action right here.  This is why nothing gets done.  You are receiving this because you have requested a new software installation.  Please take a few moments to fill the questionnaire to the best of your knowledge.  This information will help us to complete your request.  Software certification requests are processed in the order that they are submitted and will  take up to seven business days to complete once all necessary information has been submitted.  Any changes to a pending certification request will reset the clock on the seven-day service 
[00:19:00]  level agreement.  So if there's a fuck-up, you go back to the...  Right.  It's like when fucking Ace was trying to get his casino license.  It goes back on the bottom of the pile.  I asked Tim Sabine if he's listening.  I don't even know if he listens this early.  Is he okay with it taking seven days for our phones to be fixed?  And that's if everything works perfectly.  Please provide final production version of all media and installation requirements, example  files and documentation.  The certification process is intended for all new software titles and updates to existing 
[00:19:30]  software titles.  Trial versions or software with trial licenses will not be certified.  All right.  I got it.  The applicant is a bum.  So here's the questions that we need to fill in before we can get our phones fixed.  This is correct.  All right.  Number one, what is the name and version of the software you should be certified?  All right.  Let's fill this out.  Let's go along with it.  It's going to be xmcallscreener.exe to give it a name. 
[00:20:00]  xmcallscreener.exe.  Call screener execution.  I like that.  Yeah.  I kind of like it too.  Is Sal on the phones?  Is it Sal or the delightful young gal?  Same thing.  That would be Nicky.  Okay.  Not Nicky.  What is Sal doing?  Where was she?  What is Sal doing?  Is he cutting up more stuff?  Yeah.  Was he fucking shaving his chest hair?  He turned to an arrow.  Whatever happened to the stuff he cut up yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where is that?  What is he cutting up?  What is he cutting?  What is he making a nice salad?  He's cutting up radio nuggets. 
[00:20:30]  Radio nuggets.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Don just wrote, what the hell am I getting myself into again?  Ah, welcome back, Don Wicklund.  Welcome back.  He's helping the show.  Oh, yeah.  I like Don.  I like Don.  Go ahead.  We move on to the second one, which is a doesn't matter question.  Does this software have any other names, aliases, acronyms that might be used to refer to it?  Oh, jeez.  Whatever.  Jesus.  How about say, yeah, it's the call fix.  Right.  Okay.  There you go.  It's called the new call fix.  Okay. 
[00:21:00]  Call fix.  Jesus Christ.  Okay.  Is this new software or an update to an existing software?  It would be an update.  Update.  Yeah.  It's an update.  The existing software.  The circle existing software.  There's the stuff that ain't working.  Anyone else feeling like they're back in a school?  This is good.  I do feel like I'm in school.  I don't have a pen.  Do you feel like your brain's going to explode?  I don't have a pen.  I feel like I'm, no, that's okay.  That's exactly how I was in school.  And I'd leave with my, like, the assignment for the day, fold it up in my back pocket, 
[00:21:30]  and then we'd go through the wash, and I wouldn't graduate.  Yeah, you ditto.  That's my ditto.  But this paper you could do in red pen and correct all this shit.  Oh, this crap they got going here.  This sucks.  Come on, Mars.  All right.  Number four.  What is the purpose of this software?  Help me, guys.  What does this software do?  Who is your software, and what does he do?  I have these questions.  I want them answered immediately.  What do you want the software to do, Opie?  Um, suck my cock.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's put that. 
[00:22:00]  In lieu of that, maybe fix the phones.  Fix the phones?  First and foremost, though, suck my cock.  Right.  What is this purpose of this software?  To fix the phones.  What does this software do?  It fixes phones.  Idiotic redundancy.  Oh, stupid.  All right.  Okay.  How does this software enable you to do your job?  When the phones are fixed, we talk to people?  Right.  How hard is this?  Holy shit.  Just fix the phones. 
[00:22:30]  This is a form letter.  This is what is happening all over America.  Do you understand, out there in offices, how people snap and throw their chairs through  the windows?  Of course, yes.  This is a TPS report problem.  And fucking just go home and beat their fucking wives and pets?  The easiest shit is now incredibly complicated.  You know why, too?  There's no distinguishing this from somebody in a cubicle that has a phone problem would  get the same questionnaire as a live radio show where the phones are used in a completely  different manner.  This questionnaire does not apply to this application of said phone program. 
[00:23:00]  But how is this, in a company of this magnitude and size, how is this allowed to happen?  How does somebody not step in and go, this is not practical?  This is nonsense.  This should be done on the phone, I don't want it to cover their ass, you sign a quick  work order and you get it done.  You need the two bobs in here to straighten shit out.  It should be a case-by-case basis.  It's inefficient.  Right.  Waste the fucking time.  Protocol.  Number six. 
[00:23:30]  How many people will need this software?  Holy fuck.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Hey, Mars, what's happening?  Gonna need that EXE file.  Gonna need you to go ahead and come on in on Saturday.  Do that.  Could you put 4,000 as the answer?  Well, what we can do to be unsophantized.  Just put 4,000.  We can say everybody on the platform.  Because I've seen this problem.  Oh, boy.  Now you're taking responsibility.  Now you're more testing.  No.  No more testing.  How many people need this software? 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  How many are in this room and that room?  That's it.  Right.  This show.  Every other show.  How about you say, I don't know, you tell me.  That's a good answer, I think.  Okay.  Perfect.  The next question is really good.  We should have this next question answered before our phones are fixed.  Oh.  Very good move.  Good question.  Right?  Number seven is, who is the point of contact at SiriusXM for this software?  Good question before our phones are fixed.  The point of contact. 
[00:24:30]  It can't be you, right?  No, because I think that's SiriusXM for this software.  I don't know.  This sounds ominous.  It really does.  Just put deep throat.  It's like Watergate.  Right.  I have no idea who that is.  I have no idea.  Point of contact.  They just make it so complicated where you go, ah, fuck it.  I'll just continue using the broken phones.  Right?  That's what they're doing.  And then no one has to work or do anything.  Yes.  It's everybody covering their ass in a paper trail. 
[00:25:00]  It's everybody afraid that something's going to happen, that they won't be able to explain  their way out of, and they have to have the paper.  It's unbelievable.  It's just fucking endless.  All right.  Keep going.  So what is the software manufacturer's contact information, i.e. the website support number,  et cetera?  Just answer that with yes.  Yeah.  Just write yes.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  We'll put meat spin.  Meat spin's good.  Will approves be required for the installation of this software? 
[00:25:30]  You're fucking asking me.  How about yes, asshole.  That's why I'm writing this.  You're the one.  Yes, dumb motherfucker.  That's why I'm answering you.  Yes.  Oh, my.  If so, who are the approvers?  And then you should put C-mirror.  There you go.  Yeah.  All right.  Final question, hopefully.  What is the location of the setup install files?  If on a CD, where is the location of the CD?  It's actually on Don's initial email.  That's where the file is.  But it's not supposed to be on an email. 
[00:26:00]  No.  See, Morris.  That's the problem.  That's the problem, right?  So the phone's fixed?  The phone's not fixed.  You know what happens?  Here's what happens.  They're not fixed.  We're on the seven-day waiting list.  All of a sudden, they get this questionnaire and it says, what's the location of the setup  files?  Don Wicklund's email.  Oh, it's not supposed to be on email.  Back to the bottom.  Right.  Back to the seven-day waiting list.  Holy shit.  What corporate inefficient shit.  God, I wish we could do our radio show like this. 
[00:26:30]  It would be so easy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We don't have a certification number today, so we're just going to fart into the mic.  Sorry.  We'll try again tomorrow.  This is people keeping their job.  Like, someone had to write this questionnaire up.  It's like, oh, what'd you do today?  Oh, I wrote up the questionnaire.  That's necessary whenever we're going to do a software update.  Oh, that's great.  You're doing a job.  And then it's like, oh, we have to justify our job, so.  Someone actually handed this to you, though, and said, look, you've got to fill this out.  Seriously, yeah.  That's crazy.  They sent the email. 
[00:27:00]  Well, without VXE attention.  Here's an IT guy that's going to further bore us to death.  Joe in Indiana.  Go ahead, Joe.  Hey, what's up?  So, the problem is the keywords you use in there are service-level agreement.  Oh.  That was at the very beginning.  That means your IT is probably contracted out to somebody outside SiriusXM.  Sure it is.  And this is all so they don't get sued.  Of course.  Sued? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Sued.  For what?  Was it illegally using software?  Sue everyone.  Huh?  Let's say Numbnuts IT guy installs the patch without going through the process and takes  down all the phones in SiriusXM.  Your company goes, hey, you fucked up my IT.  We're going to sue you because we pay you to do this, and you say there's going to be no  problem.  I installed a patch, and now Angry Birds plays all the time.  I can't make a phone call, god damn it.  Hey, how you doing?  This is Patch Fixer Upper.  Patch Fixer Upper. 
[00:28:00]  I tried to get something in there, jerk guy's face, and all of a sudden there was oatmeal  falling all over the place.  That's impossible, sir.  No, it's not.  My partner has a stroke face and a rock head.  All right, Joe.  The service level agreement is where they reset every seven days or whatever is so that if 
[00:28:30]  they don't follow the seven-day agreement, you can terminate the contract.  What happened?  Terminate.  I understand what he's saying.  It makes sense because it's contracted out to somebody else, and they don't want to get  sued by putting in something that fucks up the phones for everybody.  So whoever that guy is, get him here to fix it.  Yeah.  It's bullshit, dude.  If your IT's in-house, you don't have to go through nearly as many processes.  Well, how come nothing's in-house?  Why is everything fucking farmed up?  IT's in-house.  Oh, okay.  It is in-house.  Yes. 
[00:29:00]  In the hizzy.  So if it's in-house, sir, what is all this then?  Well, so the deal is that you contract out your IT because you don't want to pay him  benefits.  You don't want to have to deal with them as employees.  No, but he's saying that it's in-house.  Oh, it is in-house.  Well, you're just being fucked over by bureaucracy then.  IT is in the house.  Jimmy said it perfectly.  The mud.  There's a lot of mud around here.  Stuck in the fucking mud.  Oh, muck and mire.  Everything has to be an issue. 
[00:29:30]  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  I mean, when you put those kind of...  I mean, imagine if this were a toilet.  Just imagine.  It's very easy to imagine.  Yes.  Toilet.  You had to fill out a...  Jesus.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you very much, buddy.  Absolutely.  That makes sense.  It's ridiculous, though.  So now what happens?  We filled out a questionnaire.  All right.  When do we actually get...  The phone's fixed.  This guy almost killed himself. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, the hoop almost fell on a harlot.  Mr. Harlan Globetrotter's video.  That wasn't one of the tricks that they do?  Nope.  He went up for one of those monster dunks, held onto the rim, and the whole fucking backboard  rim and everything comes falling backwards onto him.  And the rim itself just missed his forehead.  Just missed his neck.  Wow.  All he has is a cut above one of his eyes.  He's totally cool.  Oh, look at that dramedy.  He looks armless.  I love that joke.  So now what, Marz?  I guess I got to send back the answers to the questionnaire. 
[00:30:30]  To who?  Do you even know to who?  Can you get the guy on the phone?  At this time?  Hell no.  No, but I mean...  Hell no.  Hell no.  Um, Howard has a show today.  Yeah, they'll be around.  They're only around when Howard's around.  This early.  Was that...  Whoa, what's that about, Marz?  I heard that little shot.  There's been a little poker room.  There's been certain Fridays I needed IT's help really early in the morning, but they 
[00:31:00]  can't be found, because Howard's not on air.  So they only come in early when he's here.  Yes.  There you go.  They have their priorities around here.  I know that.  But we need help, too.  Nah, not really.  As long as they have Howard, they don't need to help anyone else.  I've been saying that for years.  All kinds of shit.  They don't give a fuck as long as they have him.  All right, Marz.  So hopefully the phones will be fixed.  When do you think?  Are we in the seven days?  Are we on day one? 
[00:31:30]  Day five?  Day six?  What day are we on?  Well, past experience does indicate that after we do this on air, everybody's jumping through  hoops right now.  Expedite.  My BlackBerry's probably fucking ringing off the hook.  BlackBerry?  Yeah.  The company still uses BlackBerry.  They're the only one.  BlackBerry's shit.  Of course it is.  It's absolute shit.  They're trying to sell it.  I'd rather fucking write notes on rocks and throw them at each other.  BlackBerry is cunt.  Fucking. 
[00:32:00]  Like the whole screen shake.  That fucking storm screen.  I hated that thing.  You didn't like the little clicky screen?  Fucking assholes they were.  It's a touch screen, but it's tactile.  Yeah, you can feel like you're clicking good.  I'm trying to talk.  I want to suck your cunt.  I wanted to leave iPhones so badly because I hated AT&T.  Yeah.  And they lost.  You know how bad, like Continental and United Airlines, those pieces of shit.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Do you know how bad you have to be to lose me when I'm loyal?  Mm-hmm.  And fucking BlackBerry lost me.  You should want Galaxy S3.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, at that point.  I should say S4, but I don't have my S4.  They weren't as big, though, a few years ago.  They weren't as good as they were now.  Right.  You know, like four years ago.  Yeah.  Now they're a real option.  It's a terrific phone.  All right, Mars.  So no ETA on this.  I would say that by tomorrow they'll be fixed.  Wow.  Whoa.  I think so.  I don't share Mars' enthusiasm. 
[00:33:00]  I don't either.  No.  No.  It'll be more fucking paperwork.  But it makes you realize why guys can't get stuff done.  Even, you know, guys that ran the channel, they probably have to go through this.  Imagine wanting the console cut, how much paperwork you have to go through.  A lot of paperwork right there.  Or the wall removal thing that we were goofing on.  That would have been huge.  I was tricked to think that they were going to do something with this console.  No.  The phone is gone, though.  We had people in here with clipboards.  I thought it was a guarantee.  No.  The keyboard's gone.  They've actually moved it to the other side of the console. 
[00:33:30]  Remember we wanted it off the console?  Oh, yeah.  Now it's been moved over there.  It's just moved.  It's like how a child cleans his room.  Yeah.  You just moved the shit to another part of the room.  Behind your door or something.  That's exactly what they did here.  All right.  Whatever.  Thank you, Mars.  Mars.  Six pages and a questionnaire just to get our phones fixed.  How do people deal with this shit in their lives?  Yeah.  I mean, our problems are just nonsense, obviously.  But, you know, there's people out there that really have to deal with this crap and have no choice. 
[00:34:00]  They just have to fucking bend over and take it.  I want to congratulate the New York Daily News for probably having the most horrific front page ever.  What'd they do?  I challenge you to find a better one over the years.  Daily News has a headline here.  It says, please don't die, not on your birthday.  And you've got an old guy looking at his wife who just turned 65. 
[00:34:30]  I guess she turned 65 yesterday.  She was celebrating her 65th birthday.  A horrific car accident in East Harlem where someone went flying through the light because you can't really see the light down there because of the train tracks.  The city knows this is a problem and has been a problem in the past and will be a problem in the future because you come flying down and you can't see the light.  So you're assuming there's no light there.  So you keep going.  And what happened yesterday was a massive fucking accident. 
[00:35:00]  And then one of the, I think, a delivery truck went flying onto the curb and hit this woman that just was celebrating her 65th birthday yesterday.  Yikes.  So there's the old guy leaning over her as they're taking her away.  And he said, please don't die, not on your birthday.  And that's on the cover today.  Did she?  Oh, yeah.  She's dead.  What?  Yeah, she died.  She is?  She's dead.  Oh, that's terrible.  Just a horrific fucking story.  Oh, my God.  I don't, I don't understand the, I just don't understand the purpose of this. 
[00:35:30]  They're trying to, like, tug at your heartstrings.  Certainly, we're, uh, animals.  We're in the field of shocking people at times.  Whoa.  But what the fuck?  That's terrible.  That was brutal.  That's very mean.  Heartbreaking plea to his love hit by truck.  Hmm.  So, there you go.  Ah, terrible.  And then there's, of course, the New York Post, which has band on the run. 
[00:36:00]  Sounds fun.  So you realize that one of the band members shot the other three.  No.  No, the band members not pictured who shot them.  Oh, okay.  The guy who shot was in another band.  He was kicked out, right?  Yeah.  Was he kicked out of that band?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that what they're saying now?  He was kicked out of this band.  Oh, okay.  So he was kicked out of this band.  He was in another band.  And he killed three people.  Two.  Or two and himself, excuse me.  And he wounded a third.  Two brothers.  I think there's four guys on the cover.  They're Iranian.  And they had fled Iran.  So, band on the run.  Right.  And the two of them were brothers, I guess, who probably were the alpha males of the band. 
[00:36:30]  I'm guessing.  And the one guy that was thrown out had shot the two brothers while the other two were away.  Right.  Oh, boy.  I haven't read the whole story, obviously.  No reunion concert there.  No.  And they were doing real well in the underground music scene of...  The Iranian underground music scene.  Of Williamsburg or something?  That's taking off.  Oh, Williamsburg?  Well, that figures.  I believe that they were happening.  Is that a hotbed of activity for bands, Williamsburg?  Really?  Yeah.  In what way?  People love Williamsburg.  Williamsburg's huge. 
[00:37:00]  That's hipster central.  Good for them.  Massive music scene in Williamsburg.  Oh, you're right.  There's another guy who got shot to.  You're right.  Yeah, there was another one that was injured.  And then the guy who did all the shooting went on the roof and killed himself.  Of course.  He snuck the rifle in a guitar case.  Very original idea.  Never seen that done before.  Never.  Wow.  He must have been...  I guess they kicked him out of the band.  Yellow...  What's the name of the band?  Yellow Dogs.  Yellow Dogs.  Yellow Dogs, right.  Okay. 
[00:37:30]  I guess they kicked the guy out.  They accused him of selling off band equipment.  So they kicked him out of the band.  Oh, that's a...  I wasn't very happy.  That's a good reason to fucking kill two people.  Allah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  The guy who...  The bassist, Ali Akbar Mohamed Rafi.  Oh.  I guess he jammed with the Yellow Dogs and another Iranian underground group, the Freakies.  But Rafi betrayed his bandmates stealing money and equipment. 
[00:38:00]  You just said that, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  And that was what it was.  Right.  Calculating kill.  He was kicked out.  On Monday, he went back angry.  You kicked out my friend.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Honestly, he first shot a graffiti artist and musician.  Who frequently toured with the Yellow Dogs.  Wow.  He killed him with a single bolt to the head through a third floor living room window.  I guess he shot him.  Jeez.  And the guy then climbed through the window and strolled into the bedroom of the drummer. 
[00:38:30]  And he executed him as he laid in bed.  Wow.  He then went down to the second floor and he shot the brother of the drummer.  The band's 27-year-old guitarist.  He was hitting the chest as he sat in bed working on his laptop.  How do these guys not hear the gunshots?  Right.  I'm amazed that they didn't hide her.  That's unbelievable.  Crazy.  He fired two other brothers down the hall.  This world's just crazy.  It's ridiculous.  Indeed. 
[00:39:00]  Man.  And he was screaming as he shot one guy in the arm.  Why did you bring me over here and then throw me out?  Then he went back to the third floor where he shot through the bathroom door of two weekly  renters, Coast Guard guys, who were cowering in the tub.  At least they hid, but he didn't hit anyone.  He then kicked in the bedroom door where the free key members, they gave up Pouya.  Hoseni was hiding.  Hoseni pleaded with Rafi to put his gun down and the two struggled.  Rafi's magazine clip fell out, leaving him with a single bullet in the chamber. 
[00:39:30]  Whoops.  So the one guy who fought him was spared while Rafi fled to the roof where he blew his brains  out, which is good.  That's what you should do.  Oh, that's a one bullet.  Right.  And there's a picture of him here.  He's like, he almost looks like fucking Pete Dominic.  The Iranian Pete Dominic.  You can see him right there.  Right.  And instead, the gun was brought upstate in 06 and appeared to have been manufactured  out there.  It doesn't matter.  Well, well.  Crazy goings on in the Iranian music scene. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  Who knew?  And then moving on, I guess we're doing news right here.  The Bryant Park shooter is showing some remorse today.  That's nice to see.  Oh, that's right.  He's not at all.  Oh, right.  He's motherfucking everyone and using the N-word all over the place.  They took him out of his court appearance and he was just dropping N-bombs.  Remember how we were talking about the N-word and how some people think it's a sacred word? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Someone should tell this 16-year-old kid because he wasn't following that.  He said, fuck all you niggas.  GGL.  Yeah, yeah.  Which answer?  Giggle, giggle, LOL.  Right.  He's laughing.  He's laughing.  Oh, I thought he just went, yo, GGL.  No, he said GGL.  He did.  This is a guy who's probably so scared that he has to go away and he's posturing because 
[00:41:00]  this is the guy who was going to blow his brains out and go, I fucked up.  What did I do?  That's the real guy, the panicky, should I kill myself guy.  Now he's laughing, casual guy?  No.  He's only 16.  He shot two people at Bryant Park the other night over that coat.  Enjoying the last few days of a watertight asshole.  He said it to somebody, it wasn't over a jacket, it was over your mother.  Oh, okay.  Now we understand.  Yeah.  That's fucking good. 
[00:41:30]  Comedian, too.  It's funny.  And his father's speaking out saying that he doesn't believe his son did it.  Of course.  Parents never think their kids are such pieces of garbage.  He doesn't believe he did it.  He goes, what did he say about the weapon?  He didn't have a weapon.  He's only a kid.  Did you see him with the weapon?  Yeah, did you see him with the weapon?  Right, was the exact quote.  Of course not.  What a load of shit.  You know, he's a roach.  He's smiling.  He's all happy about it.  You raised a piece of shit, sir.  And now he's getting his comeuppance.  Where's the story?  I'm looking for it in the Daily News. 
[00:42:00]  I don't see it.  Maybe it's here.  Oh, um.  Nah, probably not.  It's on page nine.  Okay.  It's right next to the, uh, uh, the yellow, uh, dog.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Right there.  Oh, a little strip on the side of the page.  Yeah, it's good.  Well, it's a yellow background, so it sticks out, though.  Guaranteed, if it was some white guy that shot up the, uh, skating rink front page, and  they'd still be talking about it, and what we have to do about guns, and, uh, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  That's, uh, the double standard continues.  That's the press.  Well, more important today was the Amy Robach story, the Junior Gotti.  A robot?  Robach.  I think that's how you say it, right?  Did they tell her on the, she found out she had breast cancer because of a mammogram she  got on the air?  No.  Oh, well, yeah, but she didn't find out on the air.  Oh, okay.  What happened was, she said that she wanted to take one for the team, like, they wanted  somebody to get their mammogram, and she's like, well, there's no history in my family, 
[00:43:00]  but she's like, ah, I think she even said, I'll take one for the team, I'll do this one.  Oh, boy.  So she does it.  She had no, she wasn't going to do this in her personal life whatsoever, and then she  assumes, okay, I did that, made it for All Right TV, whatever, and moved on, and  then she got the phone call that she actually has breast cancer.  Jeez.  That's why I saved, hopefully that saved her life.  That's what they say.  That's what they're hinting at.  She's going to have a double mastectomy.  Jeez.  Yeah, she's like, fuck down, I'm going to be extremely aggressive, so she's, uh...  Right, get rid of them, get fake tits, and move on. 
[00:43:30]  Right, so that's what she's doing.  So that was like a moment on Good Morning America yesterday, I guess.  I'm sure...  Because then she told everybody what the hell was going on.  I'm sure it's never, never an easy thing, but at least with fake tits looking amazing  now, it's like so many women get them just because they want to get them.  It's not odd to see a woman with fake breasts, so hopefully that makes it a little bit fucking  easier.  I'm going to leave some scarring.  Yeah.  And, um, I think they've got to rebuild the old nipple.  Do they?  The nipple.  Yeah, because all that shit's got to go. 
[00:44:00]  Even the nipple's got to go?  Yeah, because it's got, for the most part, because it's got, like, the fucking, uh, ducts  in it, and, um...  I know that.  And, and, and glands that are very susceptible to that shit, so they just fucking take everything  out.  Oh, okay.  But then they're able to build, like...  They're able to build a fake nipple pretty good now.  Yeah, they, they fucking twist the skin around and, and sew it in a way that, uh, it actually  looks like a nipple.  And then sometimes they just tattoo a fucking...  Can we see this all around there? 
[00:44:30]  Can we see a fake nipple?  Yeah.  Please?  Do you lose all sensitivity?  Does it ever feel like a nipple again?  Maybe not, or...  Probably not, if the nerves aren't there anymore.  Or maybe he's being dead, I would say.  Yeah, yeah, I think it's...  Of course.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  What?  Let me see.  Oh, no, it's going to gross me out.  Why?  It gives me, it makes me woozy.  No, I didn't think of that.  Looking at disease.  Why?  How do you get through this show every day?  And then Junior Gotti might have been stabbed.  Oh, he wasn't?  Might have been.  He was officially stabbed, but... 
[00:45:00]  He was stabbed in the stomach.  But...  But they're trying to figure what the...  They're trying to figure this out.  He was just breaking up a fight between two guys.  Outside of CVS and Syossus?  Hey!  That's all you need to know.  I got family in Syossus.  Syossus!  Syossus!  Next stop, Syossus!  It's a pretty mellow fucking town.  It really is.  And he's outside of CVS, and then he takes one to the gut?  Yeah.  Stabbed in the stomach.  Is he all right?  Well, he's in stable condition. 
[00:45:30]  He's still in the hospital.  Not expected to have any life-threatening injuries.  And the police are classifying him as being uncooperative.  I don't think he was quite breaking up a fight.  Probably not.  I think somebody may have been after him, and maybe they're going to suffer some consequences.  I think it's going to be handled internally, as they say.  An in-house solution.  In-house.  Right.  He's going to fill out a questionnaire.  Oh, man. 
[00:46:00]  Did people tell you to fuck?  Questionnaire.  Ten questions.  Hey.  Who is the Jadroul in question?  Yeah.  It's the inexecutable.  Yeah.  So did someone fuck up, though?  I don't know.  With the stabbing, I mean.  I mean, he wasn't...  Yeah, how do you...  If you're going to go after him...  If you're going to stab Gotti Jr., you...  Wow.  How the fuck do you just...  Yeah, you better...  Maybe with someone attempting to rob or something. 
[00:46:30]  Who knows?  Maybe.  I mean...  Someone would know who he was?  He's not cooperating, which is, you know, obviously the way it goes with that.  Even though he says he has nothing to do with the crime families anymore.  You know.  The son of the dapper Don.  He's John Gotti.  You know, you still probably, you know, think...  You probably still think the same way about dealing with the cops.  Well, yeah, yeah.  You're not going to want to deal with the cops.  Well.  They're the bad guys that put your dad in prison that, you know. 
[00:47:00]  We hope for a speedy recovery.  That's exactly.  For Mr. Gotti.  God bless.  God bless.  Exactly.  How fucking dumb would you feel as a criminal if you were just robbing somebody and then  you realized that's who you fucking attempted to rob if that's what happened?  Well, that's like that neighbor that ran over Gotti's kid.  And it's like, oh, of all the kids I could have fucking hit.  And they said he got a bad rap.  Like, years later I read that that was, like, someone who worked for Gotti had given, the 
[00:47:30]  boy's name was Frank and he had given him, like, a scooter or something that he shouldn't  have been on.  Or maybe it was...  Your grandson Frank.  It was something faster than it should have been and the kid rode it.  It was like, almost like the guy was unfortunate that he, uh...  That is a wrong place, wrong time right there, huh?  Horrible.  Yeah.  Because, uh, rumor has it, he was, uh, dragged into a van.  Oh, really?  Never seen again.  Oh, yeah.  That was that.  And to this day, no one knows where that guy ended up. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  Which is really scary.  Yeah.  I'm sure he's not on a farm upstate running around with animals.  So there are the fake nipples.  A little tattoo.  You get the nipple reconstruction with areola tattoo.  Yeah.  Uh, nipple and areola reconstruction with tattoo.  Uh, and then you get the nipple reconstruction with skin graft to areola.  Oh, okay.  So they use some other skin.  So you either get the tattoo or you could get the skin. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Uh, wow.  Where do you get the discolored skin to make an areola?  I don't know.  Maybe the labia.  Yeah.  Take some of that labia skin.  What is it, what, what is he, Rock Dylan?  He was gesturing very large.  He goes, hey.  Ordering a sandwich?  Look at the TV behind Oak.  Because Saved by the Bell is on behind you.  Oh, that's wonderful.  He's putting his hands in the air like, why would there be Saved by the Bell on right now  in the studio? 
[00:49:00]  That's not a good show.  What?  Saved by the Bell is not a good program.  I mean, you were also how old when it came out.  Doesn't matter.  Yes, it does.  How old was I when fucking MASH came out?  I was a young boy.  I still like it.  This, it throws away your whole ABBA argument, by the way, Sam.  Yeah.  Because that is the TV equivalent of ABBA.  Right, but I'm not sitting here doing breaks on the radio about how awesome Saved by the Bell is.  You just did.  What are you talking about?  You just did.  You just said how good the show was.  What's his name?  What's his name? 
[00:49:30]  Mark Paul Gossler.  What happened to him?  We had him on.  Yeah, we've had him on.  He's done a bunch of other shows.  He's doing that fucking Turner and Hooch or whatever it is.  Franklin and Bash.  It's so forgettable.  We don't even remember who he was on.  Jesus, why would you insist?  You just had him on.  Why would you last guest?  The only time I ever mention Franklin and Bash is when I say, Franklin and Bash is still on?  I'm amazed.  That interview was a goof.  We're like, there's no way this show's going to fucking last.  Ah, boy.  Does Roller love that one or which one?  No, he likes suits. 
[00:50:00]  He likes suits.  Suits and white collar.  He's obsessed with suits.  You want to take the picture of his suits?  Is it a good show?  It's terrible.  Suits?  No, it's not a good show.  Nobody watches it.  It's trying to be like Admin, I think.  Madman?  Madman.  Madman.  Madman.  Madman.  Is it the 80s?  What year was this?  Is this like 88?  Oh, it's so bad.  Yeah, it was probably like 88, 89 until like 94.  The Black Girl, what the fuck?  What was that outfit that they would wear?  Little Scream.  How would you describe the outfit that Black Girl has on? 
[00:50:30]  That's the look of the 80s, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The shoulder.  Sort of a Janet Jackson kind of a thing.  Lisa Turtle.  This is early 90s.  Lisa Turtle?  Is she slow?  The 80s thought that sort of fashionable military attire was the way to go.  Because of stupid Michael Jackson.  Yeah, yeah.  And Janet, you know.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, 89 to 93.  Look at poor Screech.  Oh, this is 90s.  Okay.  He'd end up like fucking just destitute.  Stupid Screech.  You got an update, Mars? 
[00:51:00]  No.  Mars.  You guys digress.  Can I change the TV to where it's supposed to be?  Why?  Why?  We're talking about it.  I know, but, you know, it messed up.  Oh, no, Mars.  You skated through the first break you did with us.  Unscathed for the most part.  We're all staring at the TV you want to change.  How does that make sense in your head?  I see you're watching this and talking about it on the air.  Perhaps I should change the channel.  Do you notice that all of us are turned and looking at the TV?  We're watching that.  Right.  We're talking about it. 
[00:51:30]  It's a break.  Making observations.  It might not be working, but at least we're trying.  We're looking at Saved by the Bell and we're trying to come up with some jokes.  Oh, Mars.  All right, we should break.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Let's break.  We got Tom Papa coming in today.  If he didn't oversleep again.  Really?  I saw Tom last night.  Yeah.  How is he?  Good for him.  He's a bum.  He is a bum.  Didn't he move to L.A.?  We see him more now that he moved to L.A.  Yeah.  I don't really understand that.  And then Mike Buschetti is coming back today. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  Finally.  You like Mike?  I love him.  Mike Buschetti works with Artie Lang and if it was up to us, we would fucking steal him.  He's great, man.  He really is great.  I don't know why.  Sort of kooky.  But he's just out of his fucking...  Little nasty.  No, it's not even at you.  It's like this.  Yeah.  His point of finger is up in the air, both.  I just want to say, he wants to thank you guys.  He is so zany.  Yeah, maybe you ever jump on my pole.  So Mike Buschetti, he was great out of the box, man. 
[00:52:30]  The fucking listeners loved Mike Buschetti.  And the only reason we know that is because he retweeted every single tweet with a...  How are you?  Right.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So we'll break and get into some other shit.  Don't forget, Mike Tyson is on tomorrow.  Can I say this?  I'm reading his book.  It's fucking...  It's probably the best biography I've ever read and I'm not being polite.  It's amazing. 
[00:53:00]  So do we have other copies laying around?  I would hope so.  Yeah, we should.  We should.  I've been fucking...  It's a 600-page book, dude.  It's a real book.  It's not like...  You know, like there's some kind of celebrities put out these little shit biographies.  Like 200 pages.  This is everything he talked about in his show, but much more detail.  There's so much shit I didn't know about this book.  It's amazing.  I've decided to start preparing for interviews, so...  What?  So, yeah.  Fuck.  So if I could get a Mike Tyson book to peruse...  Is there a movie that I could watch? 
[00:53:30]  Documentary.  The HBO documentary.  I'll do that.  You didn't see that.  Yeah, that's not...  You should look at the HBO documentary before he comes in, because it was...  I'll do that.  His one-man show is really good, man.  Yeah, absolutely I'll do that.  I didn't see the HBO version, though.  No, it's probably shorter than the live version.  They probably tightened it up and trimmed down whatever.  Nice.  I got a little sad reading the book already.  Very, very good.  Wow, what's this?  Wow, that thing is a giant book.  But look at that.  It's a book.  Damn, that's a thick book.  Would you want to fuck with that guy?  I'll take his ass. 
[00:54:00]  Tyson and his prime on the back cover.  If you look through the first bunch of pictures, the first batch of pictures, there's a photo  of Tyson when he was 13, he would have beaten us up as men.  No, no, when you just go through all the pictures, like the first...  This book has two giant picture sections.  Good.  Thank God.  I love pictures.  I do, too.  But look, go a little bit, and you can see like...  At nine years old, he looks like a problem.  Yeah.  What do you mean 13?  No, but you can see the arms out of him.  That's not him at 13.  There's a picture of Mike Tyson when there's 13 in this book, and he's a fucking beast. 
[00:54:30]  Holy fuck.  He's a well-built man at 13.  Holy fuck.  Holy fuck.  Those chains are high-tensile steel.  Oh, the pictures are great.  What?  Hmm?  What happened?  What?  Hmm?  He's talking about Mike Tyson.  No, I wasn't.  Watching TV.  Oh.  Saved by the bell again, right?  Yeah.  He was allowed to have pigeons in the Catskills, I see.  Very cool.  Yeah, he loves his pigeons. 
[00:55:00]  That was nice of Cuss.  I got my pigeons.  He goes into so much fucking...  None of it's boring.  Like, none of the detail is fucking dull or you want to skip over.  It's fucking fascinating.  There was a time he was one of the most famous people in the world.  He was right up there.  I'm telling you...  He was right the fuck up there for a while.  He still can't go anywhere in the world without being ready.  No, he's still obviously very famous, yes.  But there was a time he was one of the most famous in the entire world where he couldn't move.  He talks about it.  He said it was just odd. 
[00:55:30]  You'd go overseas and just walk down the street, and shop owners would be coming out screaming,  begging you to come in.  They'd have to close off areas.  Police would have to shut down.  Like, he was a fucking phenom.  Tyson had an effect that Larry Holmes didn't have on people.  He had like an Ali effect on people.  Just this amazing attraction to him.  Right.  Have you seen the photos online of his abandoned mansion?  No.  Oh, they're great.  What?  That's right for a while ago.  They're amazing.  All right, let's do it after the break.  All right.  We'll take some time on that.  I love abandoned buildings and all that shit. 
[00:56:00]  No one's living in it?  He had a tacky-ass house.  You say that to him.  You tell Mike that tough guy.  Find the website.  That's where we'll pick up the show after the break.  This is the opening entry show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the opening entry show.  Fuck yeah.  Let's do this. 
[00:56:30]  It's Neil.  Yeah, it's Neil.  I'd rather.  Fuck that shit.  Come on, Eric.  Turn mine up.  Oh, there was the bit.  That was the bit.  Oh, E.  Neil Young, 68 years old today. 
[00:57:00]  68 years young.  The grandfather of grunge, right?  That's what they call him.  We're the godfather of grunge.  I don't know.  What is it?  Grandfather?  No, godfather.  It was the godfather of emo.  Of emo.  Oh, he's the godfather of goth.  Oh, goth.  Yeah, of goth, right.  Edgar Allan Poe was really the godfather of goth.  Oh, was he?  John Cusack.  I follow him on Twitter.  John Cusack or Edgar Allan Poe?  Edgar Allan Poe.  Oh, god.  I like that movie.  You know. 
[00:57:30]  Did you?  I didn't see it.  You never saw it?  Never seed it.  It was all right.  Yeah.  I didn't mind to see that one.  Are you a Neil Young fan?  He's a Neil Down fan.  Neil for the young.  Come on.  Well, let me tell you.  Let's do this.  You are, right?  I gotta be honest.  I didn't mind him.  Many, many years ago, I had a girlfriend that was obsessed with Neil Young, and I wound  up hating Neil Young for it. 
[00:58:00]  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Russ never sleeps?  All that shit.  Yeah.  And then, like, we got into an argument once because she told me that she would have sex  with Neil Young, and I didn't want to hear that.  Would you guys angrily sing Southern Man and Sweet Home Alabama back at each other?  Yes.  Those two dorks.  Just like the song.  Why would that bother you?  There was no chance she was actually going to have sex with...  Because I was a fucking kid at the time, and I was in that type of love that I used to 
[00:58:30]  get myself into, where I used to fucking just obsess on the girl and fucking not want  to think about anybody else even looking at them, and, you know, those days.  Yeah.  Was that her one?  Yeah, that was kind of one of those deals.  Have you ever had a sit-through one of those conversations?  Oh, see, you have, right?  And then she starts crying.  I've just heard about them on TV shows.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Oh, God.  You know, we both have our one.  Yeah.  What do you mean, your one?  The one person we're allowed to have sex with. 
[00:59:00]  I asked my girlfriend who her one was, and she said, the Giants.  Oh, see?  That's all a tinfoil, man.  I gotcha.  Good explanation.  I like when he goes falsetto, like, way up there with his voice.  Give me one of those.  Damn.  Southern man.  Keep on rockin' in the free world, man. 
[00:59:30]  Keep on rockin' in the free world.  That was a great song.  Yeah, he's a little whiny.  Did they do it?  Yeah, that's one of their big ones.  Pearl Jam loves doing that one.  I want to hear how they did, because they didn't do it better than Neil Young.  Southern man better keep your head. 
[01:00:00]  Don't forget what the good bitch said.  They love Neil Young.  Yeah.  They really do.  Well, Neil Young was the godfather of grunge, so, you know.  It all started with Neil Young, I guess.  They're big Neil Young guys.  They've done Yellow Moon before.  They do a pretty good...  Yellow Moon, nice.  Yeah.  I listen to Eddie Vedder quite often, actually.  Good for you.  I have one Eddie Vedder song on my phone.  You're kidding.  Just listen to that one.  That's it. 
[01:00:30]  Which one is it?  From Into the Wild.  A Hard Sun.  That's another cover.  God, I love that.  Well, that's originally done by Indio.  Yeah.  Indio?  Is that a guy or a girl?  I don't know.  It's a guy, I think.  Was it?  I have no idea.  That song was huge in the 80s.  Indio.  Hard Sun.  Indio, I need you so...  Oh, wait.  Honestly, it wasn't even that huge.  You had to find out.  Indio.  What is that?  Alge Radio and alt-rock stations. 
[01:01:00]  Is this Indio's version?  Yeah.  Turn this up.  I love how they do it.  I don't know much about this band.  Fuck.  You hate it, right, Ant?  I love it.  It's a guitar song.  I don't hate it, but...  It's a great song.  Yeah.  Eddie Vedder's version is good, too.  Eddie Vedder did a great version of this.  All right, Travis.  We can all agree that it's better than the Indio version. 
[01:01:30]  Everything Eddie Vedder does is fantastic.  Not everything.  Oh.  Wow.  You don't like his ukulele in the little canoe?  Ah, that's great.  Hey, Iraq, the boss said to turn this up.  Yeah, I just want to hear this part.  How about you do what the boss says?  You don't like this type of thing, is it?  Yawn.  Yeah.  He wants to take sun and replace it with cock.  You don't really like emotional songs, do you? 
[01:02:00]  Okay, yeah, all right.  Yay!  Now we're cooking with gas.  Yeah.  Everybody.  What a moon.  That's right.  Did you want to hear...  I prefer Eddie Vedder's version, I think.  Yeah, of course you do.  I want to hear them doing the...  You want to hear Rockin' on the Free World?  Yeah, no, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Guy who doesn't understand radio.  Yeah, no, I want to hear it.  Is that a good sound?  Guy who doesn't...  Oh, yeah.  Turn it up.  Yeah, what are you fucking...  Stop acting like you're an Apple product.  Go on low volume.  Go in there and kiss you.  I'm going to kiss you, Rockin' on the cheek.  Is this an acoustic version?  It's MTV Unplugged.  Jesus, who doesn't play that?  What are you fucking mixing it up a little, Rock?  What the fuck?  Just play any live version.  Was that on the playlist? 
[01:03:00]  Hey, occasionally throw the acoustic version in.  Have fun with it.  Yeah, this was meant to be heard plugged in, man.  Yeah.  This is...  This is culture?  Oh, this is...  Oh.  Did you download Abba yesterday?  Yeah, I got Abba's greatest hits.  You're just sitting around with Beavis listening to Abba?  Yeah, me and Beavis. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  And a bottle of wine.  He's probably talking to Beavis and crying in his fucking wine.  Nobody gives a fucking bottle of wine, do they?  The cat's like, oh, you douche.  Quiet.  Dun, dun, dun.  Right?  All right.  These are great pop songs.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:04:00]  They really are.  Oh, what is this?  Let me have it back on.  This is a promo.  Oh, now we...  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, this is very good.  Yeah, this is fucking good, man. 
[01:05:00]  I got no qualms about this.  Yeah, really good.  You know, you might forget, I did do a drunken karaoke cover of Evenflow, my friends.  I didn't forget.  Let's hear it.  Is it on your channel?  It's on my YouTube, for the love of Christ.  Let's do it.  I did a lot of drunken karaoke's one night, and I decided I was going to post them all and take 
[01:05:30]  the heat from, of course, the listeners and viewers.  Some people didn't like the fact that I had a glass of wine with me the whole time, and  a firearm.  Why Evenflow?  You were just driving.  Yeah, just go to my channel.  It's down there, past the 800 Beavis.  I should find that.  There it is.  Okay, there it is.  Good.  Where is it?  Let's see.  Which one?  Is that it?  There's Evenflow.  I'm a little hammered. 
[01:06:00]  A little bit too loud.  I can't see, Sam.  Oh, that's the Anthony I know?  Yeah.  The music's too loud.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, then I had to tweak the music more, you know. 
[01:06:30]  I was drunk.  That's not bad at all, man.  Oh, it's fucking Pearl Jam, right?  I would like to hear a better mix, but it's pretty damn good.  Yeah, it needs, uh...  Yeah, your vocals aren't heavy enough.  I thought you said you hated Pearl Jam. 
[01:07:00]  I like Evenflow.  Okay.  He doesn't hate Pearl Jam.  You don't hate Pearl Jam.  I like Evenflow.  Yeah, you like more than Evenflow.  Yeah, you can't just pull it off like this.  You've heard this song a few times because you really liked it.  I've heard this show quite a few.  I've heard this song quite a few times.  I don't know.  This was, uh...  You're doing a very good job of this.  Oh, and then I... 
[01:07:30]  You messed up.  See?  I messed up that.  I'm sorry.  Uh-huh, you piece of garbage.  There's like, uh...  How many did I put up that night?  Oh, was I on a tear?  And then people...  I love the comments.  Is he alone doing this?  This is the saddest thing I've ever seen was another one.  Why?  You're having a blast.  Uh, you know what?  Who cares?  Who cares if people aren't around?  Uh, do Rooster.  Uh, let me hear Rooster.  Uh, Alice in Chains.  Let's hear the Alice in Chains.  I should fucking get the game.  How come these only have like 7,000 views? 
[01:08:00]  I don't know.  Who doesn't like fucking Alice in Chains?  You mean, why don't people want to watch a man doing karaoke against a beige wall?  When everything else in the world is available to them online?  I don't know.  I can't imagine why you wouldn't be glued to this all weekend.  That is true.  What the fuck?  But it's, uh, I'll tell ya.  That's what you gotta do if you, uh, uh...  You're home alone. 
[01:08:30]  Wanna sing a little?  Why not?  Who's...  Who would...  I wouldn't want to do this.  Wait, they give you the oohs?  I'm by myself.  I'm doing half the oohs.  But they give you some of the oohs.  Yeah, they give you half the oohs.  So you can harmonize with it.  Harmonize, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you gotta do your best lean staley.  You gotta do your best lean staley when you sing this.  Well, you do.  I know it is.  But you gotta put that little twang in the voice.  You know. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Whatever.  Whatever.  They found a way to kill me.  See?  He does that.  I've got a stinging sweat.  You go, maw, maw, maw, maw.  See, Jeffrey, that leads me to the world.  You gotta do that. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, some of the comments, they're amazed that I don't spill my wine while I'm spazzing  out like Joe Cocker trying to sing some of these songs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should go on X Factor.  I should.  Yeah.  It's very good.  Although one thing bothered me a little bit.  Yeah?  It was when I shook my head.  Yeah.  I had to get it out. 
[01:10:00]  Okay.  That's not...  I'll tell you something.  I'm not doing any movements or anything to look cool.  Believe me.  But sometimes when you're singing, you gotta like stretch your neck a little.  I know.  It's a...  Is that a gun strapped to your belt?  Yeah.  It is.  Fuck yeah, dude.  Not bad.  Oh, I'm fucking rocking this one. 
[01:10:30]  I'm available for bar mitzvahs, weddings, sweet 16s.  And anything else you might need ruined by an angry drunken man with a gun.  Wait a minute.  Oh, shit.  Office firings.  Workplace incidents.  Holy fuck.  There was...  There was...  You said you didn't do anything just to look cool. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, what did I do?  Is that including glaring into the camera?  Oh, I was doing...  Well, there weren't people watching.  It was live from the compound karaoke.  But we don't hear any crowd noise.  How many people are there?  There was just me and Lil Beave.  Okay.  That's so weird.  Were you looking at the Lil Beave's eyes?  Yeah.  As you were singing Rooster?  He was sitting on the couch watching.  Well, I had to do that to acknowledge...  Because I could see...  I have a laptop set up where I could see their comments. 
[01:11:30]  And some of them, they're not so kind.  Wow.  People aren't kind.  That's so weird.  Usually they are.  Lonely old drunk.  That was a good one.  Maybe these were song requests.  Is this...  I'm looking for lonely old drunk.  Could you do a song called Sad Man with a Cat?  This is what you do on a Friday night kind of a thing.  Right.  That's sad.  And then, of course, yes.  This could be the saddest thing I've ever seen was...  It's a lot of justified comments you're saying. 
[01:12:00]  Well, I'm enjoying myself.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Can I say hi to the Birdman?  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b...  Bird, bird, bird, bird.  It's a bird.  Wait.  What's he flying?  Ah.  It's a good one.  What's up, Birdman?  I want to stick ice picks in my ears.  I'm not lying to you.  Oh, shit.  You're killing me, Ant.  I don't know, man.  I thought he did a pretty good job with that shit.  Oh, man.  See?  A little too drunk.  You can't make everyone happy.  All right.  A little too drunk.  What?  You right now on this call? 
[01:12:30]  Whoa.  He sounded soused.  John in Virginia, John.  My God, that was like the at-home scene from The 40-Year-Old Virgin.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  Except really good singing.  Oh, thank you.  It was a pretty good singing, though.  The mix is a little weird, so you can't hear Ant's voice as well as you should be.  You should redo Even Flow and have a better mix.  Well, yeah, yeah, maybe I should do that.  It's amazing.  We're complaining about the mix of a man in his basement.  He's fucking in firearms.  Just fucking around.  He was singing and also worrying about a home invasion at the same time. 
[01:13:00]  Harley in Georgia, what's up?  What's going on?  What's going on?  Hey, I just got to say, that sounded awesome.  I almost couldn't believe that was you, man.  That really sounded like any better, man.  You're kicking ass, man.  Oh, well.  Yeah, Anthony did great with Even Flow.  Well, look at that.  There you go.  It's running the gamut.  Oh, it certainly is.  What's the YouTube channel for people who want to check out the Drunken Catering? 
[01:13:30]  Yes, that is O-P-A-N-T, O-P-A-N-T, X-M.  It's also up on Facebook.  Oh, it's up on Facebook, too.  Yeah, there's plenty of other songs, maybe ones that aren't quite in the rock genre.  I think the vocal quality is the second tier of topics of conversation as far as these videos go.  They just see, you know, I'm having fun.  Yeah, you are.  Why can't that translate through the video that, well, he's having fun? 
[01:14:00]  It always comes through as, oh, my God, that's very sad.  But if you're going to sit home, how many people sit home alone?  It's not an odd thing to do.  And while you're doing it, what are you supposed to just be like, well, I'm alone.  I might as well just watch TV.  Why wouldn't you go down and fire up the old karaoke machine and have a little fun that way?  Right?  Film yourself and leave your gun on your waist while you're performing.  I'm alone.  I can't protect the front door while I'm karaoke-ing. 
[01:14:30]  From what?  Exactly.  You know what.  I don't have to tell you, my friend.  He's told us a thousand times what he means.  From what?  Dumb question.  Very good.  All right.  So it's Neil Young's birthday.  I guess that's what I'm saying.  Oh, happy birthday, Neil.  People are telling me, don't forget about this note's for you when Neil Young took on the man.  Oh, yeah.  That was like, wow, look at him.  He's fighting the corporation.  That's right.  And now every single musician has embraced the corporation. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Even, what is this?  It's Bobo puking in my studio.  Oh, that's a fun one.  Sorry, a lot of great content on the O-Band XM YouTube page.  Oh, yeah.  There's plenty of good content there.  Perfect.  Bobo was actually very civilized, this appearance, at the Halloween party.  Oh, you mean when he had an erection and dressed up as Little John from Robin Hood.  In context.  Oh.  To him growing up.  That's well-behaved. 
[01:15:30]  He was well-behaved.  Was that a year ago he threw up?  No.  No, that was the...  The summer.  Memorial Day, right?  Memorial Day party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Mike Buschetti's very excited that he's going to be on the show.  Oh, is he?  He just tweeted, hi, thanks so, so much.  How are you?  He's super excited.  Have you been...  Thumbs up.  You follow him on Instagram?  No.  Oh, God.  Wow, I got it.  Why?  His Instagrams are better than his tweets.  Why?  Because they're all Instagram videos.  Right.  They're all first person, and many of them cut off mid-sign for. 
[01:16:00]  Well, how about...  Let's take a look, Sam.  Yeah, man.  No planning as to how long the Instagram video is, and...  Yeah.  Jesus.  Oh, that's not cool.  Oh, my God!  The autocomplete for Mike Buschetti on Google.  Oh, no.  The first thing that comes up, and this is...  Oh, my God.  It's Mike Buschetti retarded.  Oh, boy.  He's not retarded.  No, that's a fair question.  Yeah, but...  Fair.  But has he ever been tested?  How do we know?  You thinking spectrum?  He's definitely on the spectrum. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  You've got to follow him.  You never want to go to an Instagram and see that.  Oh, my God.  All the exact same fucking...  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Looks like the Megan's Law Registry.  He's thanked you guys on his Instagram so many times.  Start from the first one.  Let's see how many we can play.  The most recent?  Yeah, fuck it.  Mike Buschetti on Instagram.  Hey, everybody.  I'm super excited.  I'm going to be on Opie and Anthony Tuesday, tomorrow, 9 a.m.  Coming back to the show again. 
[01:17:00]  So excited.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Everybody on the show will be on ONA tomorrow, 9 a.m., Tuesday.  Mike Buschetti has returned!  He's not even centered.  No, he's almost...  You only see one eye and his glasses are drooped down.  It's like watching a message from a monster.  That's right.  You can go through your video and choose the thumbnail on Instagram.  Sure, I know.  Look at the thumbnails that he's chosen.  Go to the next one.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, God.  Everybody, I'm really super excited. 
[01:17:30]  My new web series, created by myself and my great friend, Ken Burmeister.  Who cares?  Ken Burmeister.  Come here today on Blip TV.  You don't have much time.  Check it out.  Tubby Man premiered today on Blip TV.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Why not another take?  It's only 15 seconds.  Yeah, that looks good.  His Instagrams and, like, the fucking videos on the fucking Chuck Woolery.  What was that show?  Where they were dating and they would just cut it off and I just want a girl who likes 
[01:18:00]  mitten.  Let's do the third one.  Hey, everyone.  I'm very super excited.  He's excited.  I will be back tonight to work.  These are all yesterday, by the way.  With Audie Lang.  Can't wait to come back.  Missed everybody and missed all the fans.  Coming back tonight with Audie Lang.  On the Audie Lang show.  See you tonight.  Okay.  One more.  Okay.  This is two days ago.  All right.  Good.  Hey, everybody.  I'm very excited.  Tomorrow, my new web series. 
[01:18:30]  Of course.  Everything's exciting.  Yes, he's very excited.  You're a mercy for me.  Tubby Man launches on Blip TV.  11-11 tomorrow about a fat superhero.  Join the show and watch us.  It's going to be great.  Thank you.  Go to one like a week ago.  Just go to a random one.  Okay.  How about this one?  Does this one look good?  Yeah, that's a really good cover.  Oh, yeah.  It looks like the guy from Jacob's Ladder.  Everybody, I'm super blessed and super happy to be on the Audie Lang show for 14 months  now.  Thank you, Audie.  I love you and everybody on the show.  All my bosses in L.A., DirecTV, Chris Long, everybody, James Croningen, Chris Crane, 
[01:19:00]  and I love the fans.  Getting an award?  I'll be back Monday.  What an awful Instagram video.  It's a 14-month shout-out.  Yeah.  Oh, here's one with no glasses.  Oh, cool.  Hey, everybody.  Hope you're doing good.  It's been 12 days today.  I haven't had soda or bread.  It's so much better.  I'm doing good.  These are fantastic.  I love you.  Love all the fans.  Miss you.  Miss you, Audie.  Can't wait to come back to work Monday.  This is the greatest Instagram account I've ever seen. 
[01:19:30]  It is the best.  Do the one with the hoodie.  Look at all those.  Why do you have a hoodie?  I never put my sound on on my phone, so I usually watch Instagram videos silently.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just scroll through it anyway.  Uh-huh.  Every time you post one, the sound goes back on.  Oh, hell yeah.  Let's see what Mikey's got to say.  Hey, everybody.  I'm on my way to Valley Forge PA for the Justice Wild Comedy Club Thursday and Friday,  and I'll be in Long Island with Dick's Hell's Friday Department with Sal Gubinale and Tony  Dandalfi, my great friends as well.  I'll see you back on the other Lancashire Monday. 
[01:20:00]  Have a great weekend, everybody.  Everybody just made it.  Oh, man.  Look at this.  How about the one with the lock?  Wow, way.  Wow, look at the fucking tits on that chick.  What's that about?  It's Kate Upton from Sports Illustrated.  That's their bumper?  Or we could watch this.  I used to date her.  Is he excited?  Well, my new web series, Tubby Man, with my friend Ken Burmeister, is going to be released 
[01:20:30]  on November 11th.  Go to www.shavemetubbyman.com.  How many Ws?  www.shavemetubbyman.com.  That one needs a replay.  That's good enough, though.  Everybody's been bullied in life, one way or another, at school, at work, or whatever.  Well, my new web series, Tubby Man, with my friend Ken Burmeister, is going to be released  on Flip TV November 11th.  Go to www.shavemetubbyman.com.  www, www, www, www. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, my gosh.  Here's a well-lit one.  Leon.  Hey, everybody.  I'm going to be at the comic strip in New York City, November 11th, for Veterans Day.  November 11th, 8 p.m., the comic strip, New York City.  I'll be there, 8 p.m. show.  What?  For Veterans Day.  Come on out.  Is that last night?  We got to talk to him today.  Yeah.  You know, we all use our shit to plug stuff, obviously.  But, I mean, I want to hear more about the bread and the soda and stuff like that. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  It can't just be all plugs.  No.  Oh, my God.  This is the fucking worst thing I've ever seen.  It's great.  You'd follow this?  Oh, I'm gonna.  Oh, there's a dog in this one.  All right, let's see the dog one.  Aw.  Steps on it.  Kills us.  Look this way.  Wow.  It's not doing anything.  No.  Oh, boy.  Breaks out the peanut butter.  Yeah.  What's that?  That was awful.  That was terrible.  That was horrendous. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, this one should be good.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  He's in a car.  Hey, everybody.  The best thing I love the most about being on the Audi Lang show is Audi, everybody on  the show, the fans.  I really love interacting with the fans on Twitter and Facebook.  I love you guys.  You're a big part of me now.  Thank you so much.  Be back Monday.  Does he know he can redo these?  You know what's so great about that cutting off?  Yeah.  Is that there's like three seconds of dead air when it starts.  Yeah.  He's got no concept of time as far as how long these things go. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, hey, everybody.  Check out my great friend Dave Hill's podcast and listen to it.  It was great.  And go to Twitter and follow Dave Hill as well.  He's a great guy and he's awesome.  Thanks.  Oh, he made it.  Thanks.  Thanks.  He's awesome.  Oh, that one looks good.  This one?  We're still doing this?  Anyone.  All right.  I meant anyone.  Hey, everybody.  My new web series, Tubby Man, with me and my friend, Ken Burmeister. 
[01:23:00]  Mike Burmeister.  It's going to be premiering on Blip TV in October.  Go to www.savemetubbyman.com.  Some more info.  Tubby Man, the friend of the week.  The abrupt cutoff is the greatest thing.  Oh, the dollar bill one.  What's that?  I don't know.  That's just a prop.  Oh.  He just, this is, oh, he says, this is the first dollar I ever made.  Haven't hated another one since. 
[01:23:30]  I think had.  Had.  A little joke.  All right.  Hey, can we, I want to look at Mike Tyson's old house.  Mike Tyson's going to be in tomorrow.  Mike Buschetti's going to be in in about an hour.  And Tom Popp is going to be here in about 10 minutes.  But these are the pictures of his house that was abandoned, Travis, you're telling me?  Yeah, this was the one in Ohio.  In Ohio.  These photos were taken in 2007.  Right.  He hasn't lived there since 96, late 90s.  So the place just sat there for 10 years with no one in it?  Yeah, somebody bought it, but they didn't do anything with it.  They just bought it to have it. 
[01:24:00]  And now it's.  Steve?  She did?  No, she did.  Oh, they keep cutting her off.  Kate Upton.  Why they're showing her in a bikini.  She looked great.  He had a 10,000 square foot pool indoors.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Indoor fucking whole pool area.  It's not even just the pool.  It's like, it's an entire pool area complex.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  That's a big house.  Yeah.  Look at that pool.  Jesus. 
[01:24:30]  Where do the people go if they want to see pictures of Tyson's old house?  They just Google Mike Tyson mansion and you'll.  He's a little shock, I think.  Huh?  He's a little chlorine.  It's a little murky.  A little green.  A little green.  What is that?  Yeah, look at this.  It's like the jungle room.  Oh, God.  He's got.  I want a jungle room in my house.  It's like I have some sexual intercourse.  I always had a jungle room.  Yeah, I've been in it.  Yeah, me too.  No, you haven't.  In Graceland?  No, in fucking Tucson, Arizona.  It's not like.  Shut up. 
[01:25:00]  It's an exclusive club.  What an asshole.  I love it.  Oh, right.  Terrible red rug.  Yeah.  All the phone wiring is out.  Yeah, that's still a beautiful fucking house, though.  Yeah.  God damn, Mike Tyson had a lot of money.  Yeah.  Not so much these days, right?  You know what?  I'm sure he's still okay, though. 
[01:25:30]  He's been through so much litigation and bullshit and gotten fucked over, but I'm sure he still  has enough money.  Oh, right.  That's the living room.  Yeah, I mean, look at the TV up in the corner there.  Is that like a screen TV?  What is that?  Yeah, it's like a custom.  Custom-built fucking.  That's in the 90s, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  It's up way too high, though.  That thing probably cost 100 Gs back in the day.  Yeah.  Right?  The way he talks about possessions and women, like just literally just going out and all  you got to do is just go out and pick girls up and just fuck them.  I'm like, it's just amazing how easily it was for the heavyweight champion to fuck 
[01:26:00]  girls.  Yeah.  Fly pelican.  Oh, it's got a big kitchen.  It looks like a pizza oven.  Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, look at all that.  Oh, look at his stereophonic components.  That's his electronics behind.  Oh, man.  I could use that stuff.  Where's my VCR?  Where'd it go?  I have to look at some of my old face. 
[01:26:30]  Bathroom.  That wasn't a jungle room.  That was his bathroom.  That's a jungle bathroom.  Very dark marble bathroom thing.  Yeah, I don't like that.  Yeah, I like that shit up, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, but he probably would have candles and fucking bring girls in there and stick his dick in  their shitter.  That's what I would do.  Did he ever have sex in the tub?  Probably with and without water.  Oh, God.  Yes.  He probably fucked with the sink and the towels everywhere in that house.  He probably fucked.  Yeah.  The bedroom where the magic happens.  And the bedroom looks like the plainest room. 
[01:27:00]  That just looks like...  Oh, guest bedroom.  Okay, that couldn't be the master.  Yeah, that wasn't the master.  This is where...  It's not called the master anymore.  Oh, no.  It's called the main bedroom.  Oh, a lot of real estate people will call it the main room now.  This is where I put Robin Given's head through the wall.  It's the best punch I ever thrown.  There's a lot of under-construction stuff still.  That looked like a big TV was going there.  A big theater kind of a...  It's his basement.  ...thing going on right there, huh?  This is a fixer-upper. 
[01:27:30]  What's that, blood on the floor?  I don't think so.  No, it's probably...  That is.  It's a Banksy.  Yeah.  Team Tyson.  Team Tyson.  It's his logo.  Okay.  All right.  Damn.  It's on this basketball court.  Oh!  That's the middle.  Middle of the basketball court.  Is that a real basketball?  Let me see.  Blow that up.  Yeah, I mean...  But it was snowing.  So this is snow on the ground.  Oh, it's outside.  Oh, now it all makes sense. 
[01:28:00]  Oh.  My tooth is fucking killing me.  And then...  I got something for that.  And then...  And then Ant says his tooth is killing him.  And then it fucking turns out it's number 15.  Same side.  Same fucking top.  You got the exact same tooth hurting?  Number 15.  Number 15 in the back.  Upper...  Yep.  Upper left.  Second from the back, right?  Uh-huh.  You guys are on the same cycle.  Right there.  Upper fucking driver's side.  Well, mine started with it just breaking as I was eating hummus. 
[01:28:30]  Then I got a crown.  That is pretty hard stuff.  Then I got a crown.  And then the dentist, he got me for the crown because I really needed a root canal.  Yeah.  So then I get the root canal, and then I go back and get the crown fixed because they have  to drill through the crown.  This tooth has cost me a fucking fortune because we don't have dental.  Oh, man.  And then I got aches and pains and shit.  So I go back to the root canal guy, and he's telling me that the tooth wasn't ground down  enough.  Oh, no.  We're kind of shaking it back and forth.  I'm grinding that shit because it was a little too high.  Oh, man. 
[01:29:00]  Irritating everything.  They didn't put the fucking little piece of carbon paper in there.  Yeah, that's what he did.  Bite.  Bite down.  And then you go...  And then they grind your teeth.  And grind it down.  My dentist did that.  Yes.  Because he thought it was a little high, but it was way high.  And the guy yesterday, because he's the root canal guy, because the dentist guy can't  do the root canal shit for whatever reason.  It shouldn't hurt if it's a root canal, though.  I know.  There's no root.  I know.  But he thinks it was too high, so I was grinding my teeth back and forth.  But here's the kicker.  He goes, if this doesn't work, we're going to have to do what's called... 
[01:29:30]  No, he's going to have to send me to another guy.  Well, it's always sending you to the other guy.  What the fuck?  These guys got lazy in their schooling and said, ah, fuck.  I know enough.  I just went up to this point, and I said, fuck it.  I'm going to start making some cash.  Well, if you're a dentist, why wouldn't you be one that could do all of it?  Yeah.  So he goes, look, if this doesn't work, then I've got to send you another guy.  And then they're going to do what's called a back...  How do they...  I think he said a backwards...  Backdoor fucking...  A backdoor hip-holding.  A backwards filling where they go through the gum and then fill the tooth from the root. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, so why?  They can't drill in through the bottom.  I don't fucking know.  Or the face of the tooth anymore, so they've got to go through the gum.  That's like surgery.  Yeah, it is surgery.  It's crazy.  And then he goes, but you don't really want that.  And then he asks the question.  He goes, can you live with this?  How bad is the procedure if the guy goes...  Exactly.  And he's not even the guy doing it.  He says, can you live with this?  Well, it hurts.  Why should you? 
[01:30:30]  Yank it out.  That's what I say.  It's just a dull, stupid ache.  I notice my tooth all the time.  Get rid of it, man.  I would rather just fucking...  Let's yank it right now.  How do we do that?  Just take our dicks out and get busy.  Yeah.  Whoa.  What?  Higher hope for that joke.  Well, that was unexpected.  I didn't mean to stop the show with a bevy of hotness.  But then I'm telling Ann, and then he goes, he's got the exact same fucking tooth that's hurting him.  Did you guys bang heads kissing?  You ran in for an aggressive peck?  Ooh.  Hot!  Yeah.  And my teeth are all right, man.  I haven't had many problems over the years. 
[01:31:00]  Just a few cavities.  Next Wednesday, I go to have this temporary bridge done.  Right.  They made the real one, and then they got fitted and everything.  Ah, what the fuck.  But, uh, I swear, I've probably put a brand new, like, SUV.  Sure.  Cost of a brand new SUV in my fucking mouth, and I'm not done yet.  I still gotta get the big, uh, you know, fake laminates.  Right.  So I look like Doug Henning.  Oh, no.  That's my goal. 
[01:31:30]  How much have you spent so far on it?  I think it's money well spent, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Probably about 20 G's.  Wow.  About 20 G's.  I'm a few thousand on the one tooth alone.  Yeah.  One fucking tooth.  It's cray-cray.  A few thousand?  Fifteen crown.  Yeah, at least, at least 2,500 at this point for one fucking tooth.  And then, of course, Dr. Steve writes immediately.  Ah.  Take 600 to 800 milligram ibuprofen now.  Ibuprofen.  If it keeps hurting, they may have to extract it. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, the dull throb.  They'll go in through the gum, but what happens is you get a lot of, like, plaque and tar to build up, and they have to go in there.  A lot of times what they'll do to me is they'll rub pre-seminal fluid in my mustache, and I smell that, and it takes away the pain.  That plus an anacin.  Anacin.  Anacin.  Could Dr. Steve call today?  Ah.  He's got great stories about his ex, and I think he finally figured out a way he could tell him on our show.  Oh.  I had him over once, and we were drinking wine.  Uh-oh.  He gave me... 
[01:32:30]  The lowdown?  Oh, my God.  And there's an Abba story in there, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think there's an Abba story, so if Dr. Steve could call today, that would be great.  I think he's, um, he's supposed to be coming to New York at some juncture.  Uh, tomorrow.  Oh, is it tomorrow?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  And he's going to be on our show Friday.  Oh, okay, because I invited him to the compound there.  Ah, we're booked Friday.  We can't.  What?  I'm having a poker game Friday.  Oh, wow.  Is it Friday?  Wednesday, UFC?  Saturday.  Saturday.  Okay, I'm having a poker game and UFC thing at my house Saturday. 
[01:33:00]  Can I go?  Yes.  I'll be, you know what, I'm going to be in fucking Albany.  No, Jimmy!  God damn it.  You haven't been over the house in a long time.  I know, I'll be in fucking Albany.  Love of Christ.  When I was a kid, I was so cute, I would say Albanini.  That is funny.  It got a laugh, but I didn't know not to keep saying it, but then it stopped getting a laugh.  Right.  Do you know, I got my, uh, I was saying this earlier, I got my, uh, my fucking school tax bill.  $25,000 a year for school taxes. 
[01:33:30]  You're just realizing that?  I don't have, I don't have a kid.  You're just realizing that?  Oh, it went up again.  Yeah.  From what?  That's a lot, man.  I don't know.  24.  It makes the value of your house more.  That's their thinking well.  It brings your property value up.  I wouldn't mind if I knew where the fuck the money was going.  Well, it's going to keep kids from burning my cars and fucking shootings in my neighborhood.  How much of that money is being wasted, though?  It's extortion.  It's like, hey, if you pay us enough, it's pretty much protection money that undesirables  will not walk your neighborhood and, uh, and shoot people at fucking skating rinks. 
[01:34:00]  How do I, I need ibuprofen for real.  You need some ibuprofen?  I took some Excedrin for mine and it's fine.  The tooth hurt so much fucking yesterday.  My dude!  Yeah, give me some ibuprofen, you fuck.  He punched me!  And I can't, I can't go to your poker game because I have to, I have to go to a wake  in Buffalo, New York.  What a double depression thing that is.  Holy fuck.  I can't think of a more horrific thing to do on a Saturday. 
[01:34:30]  And I'm also watching Anthony's lonely karaoke videos.  It's very depressing.  I know you guys didn't know him, but a really good dude we lost in this business, Iron Mike  Benson.  Where'd he go?  Well, didn't he, uh...  Oh, the great beyond?  He had the big C.  And the stomach.  I worked with him in the, the Buffalo days.  I thought he had a fat wife.  The big C.  I don't know him.  It's not personal.  It's a dumb joke.  It's all good.  It's all good.  He was a solid dude, though. 
[01:35:00]  He was, uh, a lot older than me when I came to fucking Buffalo with a radio dream and he  was cool to me, so...  I gotta go up there, though, for a wake in Buffalo, New York.  Oh, my God.  That is a horrendous combination.  Oh, God.  But I think the Jets are playing up there this weekend, so maybe I could sneak a little,  a little Jets game in and maybe go to the...  Oh, there you go.  It's the best way to take lemons and make lemonade.  Yeah.  Maybe anyone got an extra ticket?  Maybe I could squeeze in the Jets, then head over to the fucking service. 
[01:35:30]  That's good, because that, uh, esophage...  Cancer of the esophagus there, does...  People look great laying in the coffin after, uh, battling that one.  Horrible.  You know.  He was only 60.  What are they?  Three pounds?  Because, uh, that's what...  That's what happens.  Yeah.  My brother's old boss there at, uh, when he was making pistol, custom pistol grips,  I guess this guy was fucking, you know, grinding away staghorn, mother-of-pearl, ivory, fucking,  all kinds of shit, abalone, to make these semi-precious, uh, pistol grips. 
[01:36:00]  And he was breathing in and pretty much eating the powder for his whole life.  Oh, fuck.  And he wound up getting that.  They just didn't know back then.  Oh, it was terrible.  They had a, like, he was talking about his...  Yeah, right!  They put the stomach, like, in his back.  They had to cut his esophagus out and, like, put his stomach in his back.  How do you pick up chicks that way?  You don't.  At that point, chicks are done.  Wait.  You don't.  Done with you.  Stomach in your back?  Why?  Is that a real procedure?  Because they had to cut his esophagus out, move the stomach up, and then they can't put 
[01:36:30]  it in your chest because your heart's there, so they move it around to the back.  For how long?  Imagine you're full and you got, like, a hunchback.  You're like, oh, I'm stuffed.  Wait, why did you go back there?  I don't know.  Well, I guess that's where they found room to put it.  The medical community likes to make you look silly during your time of need.  Oh, it just seemed, like, horrible.  And then, you know, he was kind of a hefty guy and he wound up, like, weighing nothing  when he died.  Oh, that's horrible.  Yeah, it sounds good.  Yeah.  Take that, Wichita. 
[01:37:00]  Buffalo.  Buffalo.  God, is it going to snow up there on top of it?  Oh, that's what you need, too.  Yeah, but will it be this weekend?  I'm sure it's snowing there.  Yeah.  Sure it is.  But, uh...  Sure it is!  I don't want people to be confused.  He was a solid dude, this Mike.  This Iron Mike Benson.  Solid fucking dude.  Damn, what the fuck is that?  Great guy.  What is that there, Sam?  Um, you know how Disney has the, uh, pop resorts?  Sure!  Like the, uh, pop century and the music, the little, uh, the cheap hotels. 
[01:37:30]  Cheap little resorts on site.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  They have a thing called Pop Century.  Uh-huh.  Where they celebrate the 50s through the 90s.  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Yeah.  Across a river.  Yeah.  There's an abandoned hotel.  Ooh, sounds scary.  And it's the pop resort from the 1900s to 1940.  I can see it.  That they just never did.  Why didn't they do it?  I guess they figured nobody's going to want to stay in the 1940s. 
[01:38:00]  Well, God, I wanna, I'd love going.  I'd be goose stepping around.  I love going into abandoned buildings and shit.  Do we have any connections?  Because I don't feel like getting arrested.  You would have loved the fucking, when we were in Iraq and got to go into Saddam International  I would have loved that.  It was all decorated like the 70s, like the weird green color.  That would have been cool.  Yeah, it was great.  That's not there anymore.  Oh, Travis knows a little bit about this.  I know a lot a bit about it.  I'm opening a comedy club there.  So they were planning to finish Pop Century, and then 9-11 happened. 
[01:38:30]  Tourism kind of went down, and they decided it wasn't worth it.  So they left the building as it was, up until two years ago, and then they turned it into  the Art of Animation Resort.  Oh, wow.  Right.  So it's still busy?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  You guys follow Abandoned, I think it's called Abandoned Picks on Twitter?  Oh.  Wow, a great Twitter account.  Dude, that looks like dormitories.  For a long time, you could walk over the little bridge from Pop Century. 
[01:39:00]  Where was it?  It was right across from Pop Century.  That's where the motels.  Yeah, I mean, those are the value resorts.  Oh, well, then I don't know what the fuck that is.  I stay there once.  I only stay at the upper end.  What's that?  That's for people that are going on the cheap.  That's for the poor people.  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  Still nice.  Yeah, still nice.  Look, I was poor for four years and not, so.  Oh, please.  For those who, you know, need to go on there.  Go to Abandoned Picks on Twitter, if we're talking about this shit. 
[01:39:30]  Back to Mike Braschetti.  Did you say Mike Braschetti or Abandoned Picks?  Tell Mike when he gets here, we want him to come up with three subjects that we should  talk about today.  No problem.  Because when we get him on a subject.  We're trying to work on a sales bit.  Okay, this is Abandoned Picks on Twitter.  If you like abandoned buildings and exploring, this Twitter account is amazing.  What does that say?  Abandoned power plant in Budapest, Hungary.  Right. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Just an abandoned power plant.  Look at that.  A room with a tree just growing in the middle of it.  That's how long that thing's been sitting there.  An old green room.  It's weird that that used to be a vital room.  That was a room of activity and a room of work.  Hustle and bustle going on there.  These pictures are a work of art, man.  They really are.  What's that?  You ever look at all the old, like, Chernobyl photos?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Scary.  Chamber of Commerce in Belgium.  I'm a little too excited to be.  I know.  I usually save those for New Year's Eve when I'm alone.  How horrible little theater is that? 
[01:40:30]  It's a propaganda theater in the Soviet Union.  Wow.  How'd that work out for him?  Not that great.  No.  Terrible chairs.  Just an old library, I would bet.  In Detroit.  Ah, it's Detroit.  What is that, a library?  It's the same as fucking the old Soviet Union.  Wow.  Ah, fucking Detroit.  Yeah.  Train tracks that just go to nowhere now.  Wow.  That's a prison.  Really?  French Guyana.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, abandoned pics on Twitter.  Check it out for yourself.  That's a whole fucking village. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  What is that?  It's in Italy.  And they kept having earthquakes, so everybody left.  Everybody left?  And that's it?  That's it.  Just sits there on a hill?  Yep.  How cool would that be to just wander around that shit?  That's pretty cool.  My favorite are abandoned amusement parks.  Yeah, those are good.  I'm obsessed with just the fact that there was so much fun there once, and now it's just  completely open.  Yeah.  What is that?  It's a monument in Croatia.  Oh, wow.  Croatia.  Is that, you can go in that, or no?  Well, I mean, you have to sneak in.  You've got to be sneaky. 
[01:41:30]  These are all abandoned.  Be very sneaky.  Yeah.  I don't know how to go to Croatia.  There's a, there you go, Travis.  Yeah.  An old amusement park.  A fucking dinosaur.  I could use that dinosaur.  First wheel.  There's photos of the Six Flags down in New Orleans, which they never reopened or fixed  after Katrina.  Flying saucer.  Oh, wow, really?  Yeah.  Pennsylvania.  What's that?  That's the future house.  A futuristic house in the middle of the woods of Pennsylvania that's now abandoned.  It looks like a flying saucer.  That's stupid. 
[01:42:00]  What the fuck?  Look at this shit.  What's that?  Oh, that's radio.  You can't.  Oh, what the hell is that?  A fucking doll factory.  That's cool.  All right.  That's creepy.  With the head still on the conveyor belt.  It's still there.  So those, they had every intention of completing those dolls, and then what?  The word comes down, and they just turn off everything and leave?  Doll production down to nothing.  Right.  We'll leave now.  We'll come back.  There's a park down in Disney, River Country, which they closed 10, 15 years ago, and they 
[01:42:30]  never did anything with it.  It's just, it's still sitting there.  Disney and where?  River Country sounds horrific.  River Country was great.  It was built out of-  Oh, you've gone?  Yeah, I used to go when I lived in Florida as a kid.  What was it?  It was built around a quarry.  A rock quarry.  Yeah.  It was incredibly dangerous, looking back on it.  Uh-huh.  And they closed it right around the time, right after 9-11.  They've never really officially said why it was closed, but I think there was some issues  with the safetiness of the water that was in there. 
[01:43:00]  But, uh, it's all still sitting there.  Wow.  It's just behind, you know-  I rented one of the boats.  Yeah, it was right there.  It was contemporary.  I rented one of the boats, uh, and went through the rivers down there at Disney and saw the  old tree houses that they used to have.  The old tree house resorts.  Oh, wow.  And they're abandoned.  Yeah.  Wait, they were just, they were nice places to sleep in trees?  Yeah, they were like, you know, they were kind of fake trees and everything, but they  were levitated up.  That'd be cool.  Like little condos in the trees. 
[01:43:30]  Right.  There was a show on Discovery about the world's coolest tree forts that made me want to go  into one.  Like a nice one.  I already saw that.  When?  Just now?  No, who was here?  I said-  Uh, it might have been Ice-T.  If I ever get a house, I'm building a tree house where I can nap.  Was it Ice-T or Ice-Q?  Oh, Ice-T was Ice-T.  It was Vanilla Ice.  Jesus.  It really was.  I still can't get that Ice shit right.  Fuck the Ice people at this point.  Enough! 
[01:44:00]  What's your real name?  I can't get you guys right.  I would-  Why would-  You should do that.  Yeah?  I would build a-  I would build the coolest tree-  I kind of have an aversion to tree forts these days.  Tree fort, tree house, whatever.  And it would be-  It would be heated.  It would just be one-  Make me feel gay.  One fucking bed in there, a TV.  Ooh, one bed.  Fuck yeah.  Did you see that special on Discovery?  No, I gotta see it.  Dude, it's fuck-  I would do that in a second.  When you see some of the tree forts people have built, it's like a home. 
[01:44:30]  They're fucking amazing.  A homo.  I would just hate the bees buzzing around.  Oh.  Causing a ruckus.  I don't want a man cave ever.  But I would do a fucking tree house.  Hmm.  In a second.  Whoa!  Hey!  Whoa.  Tree house master.  Fuck yeah!  Fucking heavy.  It's a little different than when I was a kid building a tree fort.  Yeah.  Where you just had to find your shit.  Find the wood.  It was always rotting wood that you just figured would be okay.  And the beginning phase of building the tree fort was the most treacherous. 
[01:45:00]  Because you had to build those braces that were going to hold the floor joists between  the two or three trees.  And you really didn't have anything to support yourself.  You used to have to actually nail two-by-fours into the tree as a ladder to stand on.  Right.  And then you would nail in the braces for the floor.  And then once the plywood floor went on, a piece of plywood for the floor, then you were  pretty good.  I will bet a lot of money that this is a problem now, that you can't just build a tree house 
[01:45:30]  in your backyard.  You can't.  Without permits and all sorts of shit, right?  I just recently read something where somebody, a neighbor, turned in another neighbor for  a tree fort.  Of course.  Because there wasn't a permit.  You need some kind of environmental thing for the trees.  Because they want their fucking taste.  Because they want their fucking taste.  For the trees.  Yeah.  Wow.  That thing is pretty fucking rad.  That looks like the Ewoks hideaway.  How great would that be?  You want to take a nap?  You go out to the backyard to your fucking tree house?  Tree house.  Or the Swiss family Robinson tree house at Disney. 
[01:46:00]  Tree house masters.  I got to check out that show.  We should take a break because Tom Papa's here.  Mike Buschetti's coming in a little bit.  And I think we just need to...  Oh, the Buschetti.  My mother used to make Buschetti.  It was fucking melting your mouth.  Oh, and I have a special announcement.  What?  If you have nothing to do this weekend, I'll be in Albany.  Jesus.  That's a horrible announcement.  Albany.  I literally...  I draw more people in this room than I do in Albany.  That sounds worse than doing a wake in Buffalo, New York.  I know. 
[01:46:30]  It'll be the same reaction, too.  I'll be in Albany this weekend.  Come one, come both.  You can go to jimnorton.com to tours and get tickets.  And the picture thing has been fixed.  There was an issue.  The pictures weren't rotating enough when you go to my site, the homepage.  So my web guy's very good.  Sit on it and rotate.  Remember that?  Sit and spin.  Hey, sit on it and rotate.  You never said that as a kid?  I did.  It's a cool thing to say. 
[01:47:00]  Tom Papa is here with luggage.  Oh.  Talk to him next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Series XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  I remember this.  This reminds me of Howard in the 80s.  That was the bed.  Ah, E. Vincent, Robin. 
[01:47:30]  E. Vincent luggage.  It was.  This is like the bed he used for a lot of commercials.  You do that so well.  I was a fan back in what they called the day.  Tom Papa in studio.  Good morning.  Good morning, Tom.  It's snowing outside.  Yes.  It's snowing.  It is.  It's crazy.  I want you to explain how we see you more now that you moved to L.A.  I'm very confused about that.  I haven't been there in a while.  We had a big going away party for you and everything. 
[01:48:00]  Like, God, we're going to miss them.  Well, this is what happens when you go to Los Angeles.  As soon as you land, you start getting offers to do things in New York.  Oh, see.  I wouldn't know.  I've been living in a hotel here in New York without my family for the last couple weeks.  Because you moved to L.A.  You moved, and then I have this show that I'm doing for the National Geographic.  Get your name in the National Geographic. 
[01:48:30]  On the cover of the National Geographic.  We suspected Tom's a big flop in L.A., and we addressed it last night at dinner.  Oh, no.  Did you?  Yes, we did.  We suspected Tom's move to L.A. was realized to be a horrible blunder.  And he's crawling back.  Yeah, he's taking, as I said last night, the tail-between-your-legs flight back to New York.  The National Geo Show.  Yeah, Nat Geo.  Me and Michael Ian Black and Seth Herzog were hosting this science show. 
[01:49:00]  And this comedy science.  Thomas, what type of science will you be addressing?  Science!  I love science!  Weird, like...  Snuckamora, you're beautiful.  Weird stuff, like, that, uh...  Jackass meets Mythbusters?  Yes!  You son of a bitch!  That was our show!  That was our show!  I'm doing it!  They finally got that thing made!  They finally figured it out!  What?  What's the name of the guy doing it?  Because I think that I had spoken to him. 
[01:49:30]  I remember that.  Remember, we wrapped a, uh...  With lawsuits or without lawsuits?  I forgot.  Uh-oh.  Didn't he say without lawsuits?  Without lawsuits.  Me and Ann were pitched a show, and he said it's Jackass meets Mythbusters without lawsuits.  It's kind of what it is.  What?  Oh, okay.  What do you do on the show?  Um, I host it.  We have to present our cool facts, and the audience votes in front of an audience who has  the coolest facts.  Oh, it's different.  So, uh, like, the other day, I wrapped a guy in bubble wrap and dropped him from the 
[01:50:00]  ceiling.  Oh, shit!  To see if he would survive.  Is he okay?  He's dead.  Oh.  And, uh...  Fun fact right there.  That's a fun fact.  You can't do it.  You win.  That guy wasn't full of shit.  I know.  It worked.  And then, uh, the other one was, uh...  I hear you need a lot of bubble wrap.  Put a pickup truck, put a pickup truck on top of, uh, like a real heavy pickup truck on  top of, uh, coffee mugs, and they don't break, because the weight is distributed evenly.  Wow.  But then when we all jumped in it and moved around, they all smashed me. 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  I wouldn't doubt it.  The dispersion of energy.  Yes, yes.  Can we go back to bubble wrap guy?  How'd you get that done with lawyers?  Um, I don't...  We're not even allowed to finger girl these days, and you're allowed to drop a guy from  a ceiling?  I, uh, yeah, they just put a guy...  It was a stuntman guy, so he probably signs away his life.  So we need girls that are stunt women.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And then we'll be able to figure them out.  We almost got that.  We were like, one letter off.  Very nice.  Yeah, because I remember seeing somewhere, it might have been Mythbusters, that you need 
[01:51:00]  a lot of bubble wrap, to protect somebody that's falling.  Yeah.  Like, from any reasonable height.  It wasn't a crazy amount.  Oh, okay.  I mean, it was a lot, but it was like the thick bubbles.  Nobody...  And it was probably...  Okay, that's where I'm asking.  Probably like this.  Six to eight inches, maybe?  I think they dropped him from like 20 feet high, though.  This was like 15 feet.  Wow.  Yeah.  He hoisted him up.  Was he hurting?  They hoisted him up to the top of the ceiling.  He must have hurt.  He was just laying in there, like, he was like a little pig in a blanket. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, a little burrito.  Yeah, and then they just dropped him.  I mean, the trick was to make sure they didn't drop on his head.  He had to drop flat.  Because his head's sticking out.  Hit as much bubble wrap as possible.  Right, exactly.  More dispersal of energy.  Why is it that you put in planes and you wrap yourself in bubble wrap if it's going down  and everybody survives?  Yeah, that'll do.  Yeah.  Wow.  You can't sell as many seats.  How about wrap the whole plane in bubble wrap so when it crashes, it's fine?  It wouldn't be practical because it would blow off.  The tape would blow off in the fucking minus 50 degree weather.  The guy's head was sticking out of the bubble wrap? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, like a pig in a blanket.  Crazy.  You should have teabagged him.  Raped his mouth.  Here's a fun fact.  My balls stink.  Bite my dick and I'll suffocate you.  Were the mugs that the truck went on, were they like dome-like?  No, they were like diner coffee mugs.  Really?  Yeah, just the white porcelain things.  I like this show.  It sounds good.  Is it on TV yet?  I like that science shit.  It comes out in January.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  With Brain Games alongside Brain Games.  I like that Brain Games show too.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, it's going to be next to that.  Watch that and boy, you'll suck me in with an optical illusion any day.  Yeah.  Like, ah, my mind's fucking with me.  I don't know what that is.  It looked like it was backwards, but it's forwards.  Those lines, there's no way they're the same length.  I know they're going to say it is, but it don't look like it to me.  Which line is longer, the one on the left or right?  I know it's the same.  I'm yelling.  I'm pausing with the tape measure on the screen. 
[01:53:00]  It is the same.  Oh, my God.  How does this work?  It's crazy.  How do they do the staircase one?  That's fucked up.  What, the one where the stairs keep going up?  Yeah.  But the other side's going...  Is that Escher?  Is that an Escher drawing or something?  How the fuck do they figure that out?  I don't know.  That's pretty fucked up.  It's science.  Science!  It really is science.  She brought me with science.  So I'm doing, uh, tonight I'm doing two of them, and tomorrow two, and then...  Do you cut a Mobius up the middle and watch it? 
[01:53:30]  If your fans want to come for free to watch the taping, there's two today and two tomorrow.  Oh, where?  Here, right down the street.  So you really had to leave L.A.  Hence the hotel.  Yeah, I really left.  And left my family.  But your family didn't want to go.  Uh-oh.  No.  You were the one that wanted to go, so they should have stayed here.  You just went there.  This kid's got to go to school.  I'm very confused.  Yeah.  It's a weird thing, because I'm here, and my wife is very unhappy about it.  Right.  And, uh...  That's what she's telling you.  She's not unhappy about it.  Oh, my God.  She doesn't have the house to herself. 
[01:54:00]  Nice, sunny Los Angeles.  Exactly.  But I'm sending pictures of, like...  You know, they put the tree up by Radio City, so I took a picture of that.  Oh.  And it's like, I can't send them home, because it just makes her more angry than I'm in New York.  It's like, to this morning, it's snowing.  It's like...  Yeah, yeah.  It's very...  It's magical in New York.  Very magical and Christmassy.  Yeah.  In L.A., it's the same old...  And they're sweating their asses off in November.  Right, exactly.  Sweaty, no Christmas cheer, Halloween.  The only way you can tell things are changing, because you go to CVS, and the displays are different. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, the displays on the...  Yeah, that's true.  That's as much spirit as you get out there.  I remember, also, when I was living out in California, you could tell it was winter and Christmas by how high the river got.  Like, the flood control things.  You'd be like, wow, it's raging.  That's winter.  Oh, Santa's coming.  Yeah.  Santa's coming.  They had a line.  Santa's coming.  The magic...  Santa's here.  The magic Capistrano River is full.  Yeah, that's gotta be fucked up for people that don't, you know, celebrate the seasons. 
[01:55:00]  It is weird.  It's constant.  It just keeps going.  We just take it for granted, I guess.  It's funny, because it gets to, like...  We woke up a couple weeks ago in the morning, and it was, like, 50.  And people literally had, like, North Face Jackets on.  Yeah, freezing.  And Ugg boots, and it's freezing cold.  Yeah, yeah.  It does change you, though.  I think something really happens to your blood, because as soon as I get here, I'm really frozen.  It's really cold now, right?  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  When you're here, you're just like, oh, who cares?  You know, and then you come back, you're like, it's so cold.  Yeah.  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  It's so cold.  And then, God forbid, it's cold in L.A. when you get back.  Would you bring the temperature with you?  You bring that weather with you?  You want to get laughs?  You say that.  You like that one?  Fuck yeah, man.  Would you bring that weather with you?  I said to them one time, I said, I wish you would have brought the sun on the darn plane with you. 
[01:56:00]  That would have been very dangerous.  The laughter ensued.  I bet.  Ensued.  These are heavy headphones.  You got the fucking...  You have the beats.  And for Tom, with that head to say that, that's a heavy headphone.  Tom's a big-headed man.  My neck doesn't need any more weight to hold this hell.  You want regular headphones?  Those things are fucking overrated.  Yeah, these are heavy.  No, I gave Mino a homeless guy on the way home.  I didn't need them.  They're very bassy, too, right?  They're incredibly heavy, and they're bassy. 
[01:56:30]  Get him a pair of real headphones.  You could count on that.  Yeah, it's bassy.  Oh, E-Rock.  Thanks, E.  What kind of shirt you got on today?  What are you doing, Eric?  Is that pop-up?  Get away from me.  Gone.  Eric, get away from me.  His hair's a little punkier.  What are you doing?  Do your duty.  Get away from me, Eric.  Is that a Popeye shirt?  Yes.  What is it?  It's like retro.  It's like Russian.  Yeah, it looks like a Russian Popeye shirt. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, it's so much fun.  How do you find a Russian Popeye shirt, Eric?  You have the weirdest find.  Whippy's wearing me shirt.  You want another hamburger?  You fat fuck.  He just came in and gave him that, folks.  Oh, my gosh.  He has another t-shirt under it, too.  He has a t-shirt under his t-shirt.  It's a Chinese Superman shirt. 
[01:57:30]  He has so many cool t-shirts.  He's got to wear two at a time.  He's a fat fuck.  I've got to play this video.  I really do.  I don't want to say what it is.  Oh, well.  We're going to find out.  Yes.  It's probably the video of the day, as far as our world goes.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Don't look at the title.  Oh, oh, oh.  Not looking.  Not looking.  Very excited.  It's one of those DNA shows, kind of like the Maury thing. 
[01:58:00]  Craig!  What's that?  This guy is a white supremacist.  Oh, and he's sitting next to a woman who I recognize that I hate white people hat anywhere.  That is...  They mentioned my name, though.  So the guy's a white supremacist, and they're doing DNA tests.  Okay, but that's what they're supposed to say.  DNA tests.  And now we're going to hear the results.  Yes.  Okay, go back, though, so you can hear the name. 
[01:58:30]  Be quiet.  Oh, God.  You can hear the name.  Be quiet.  He's ruining everything.  Craig Cobb.  Craig Paul Cobb has undergone DNA testing to determine genetic ancestry.  Okay.  86% European, and...  Give it to him.  Give it to him.  14% sub-Saharan Africa. 
[01:59:00]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Hey!  Hold on.  14% black is the white supremacist.  That woman's laughing.  14%.  Ant's face is getting angry.  You're getting angry.  This is supposed to be funny.  What's wrong?  She's chuckling like it's a joke.  She's laughing at him.  Why is she laughing so hard?  It's like, ha-ha.  So you're 14% inferior.  Is that what she's laughing at?  Like, what's the joke?  He's a white supremacist.  Oh.  And he doesn't want to be 14%.  Oh.  See, she's laughing. 
[01:59:30]  I'll explain to you.  No, I'm not going to allow Craig to laugh.  The irony of the situation.  Of course.  Big hold of this, because...  This character's not taking off.  I don't care how much you push it.  You don't...  I hate this Craig character.  Oh, this is a new one?  It's the worst one, Tom.  But the irony is that she's...  He's not who he thinks she is.  She took off.  She took off.  And it's taking you off big time.  It's a big hit.  This is called statistical noise. 
[02:00:00]  Sweetheart, you have a little black in you.  Yes.  Listen, I'll tell you this.  Oil and water don't mix.  So, hey.  Oh, that's a good one.  Bro.  Bro.  Oh, there you go.  I think they bamboozled him.  What?  They bamboozled him.  What do you mean, they bamboozled him?  Jimmy, did you...  No, I did not, actually.  No.  There's a fart wafting around here.  No.  Sam.  If I did, I don't remember it.  Sam, yes, you did. 
[02:00:30]  You sheepish look.  Sam's putting a little...  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  I'd probably fess up to it if it was.  No, you wouldn't.  Probably.  I wouldn't.  Because you're fucking...  You don't like to...  You're very effeminate.  You don't want to admit that you poof.  Searching.  I think they said that for the show, by the way.  Why?  He didn't look like he had 14%.  Why are you getting upset?  He's the whitest guy I've ever seen.  I know.  He was like...  But why are you getting upset?  It's just a silly, stupid talk show bit.  It's fun.  The woman's laughing at him.  Yeah.  It's not...  You see, you're just looking at the surface visual pretty colors of the picture. 
[02:01:00]  I'm looking deeper into the social commentary that was going on right there.  What they're really saying.  Yes.  That's believable, though.  I mean, we are all from the same fucking primordial gunk.  So we're all connected on some level.  Some primordial gunk is a little better than others.  That's true.  When I say...  But didn't they debunk that fact that everybody came from Africa?  Yes, they did.  Maybe it was Asia.  I don't know exactly where.  But I think we all come from the...  You know, similar...  Maybe not.  I think from another planet. 
[02:01:30]  I don't think it's really...  I don't think the important part is where we all sprouted from.  I think the important part is where we went after that.  What we accomplished in that time.  Let me hear rapper Ant.  It ain't where you're going.  It's where you're at.  Oh, shit.  It ain't where you're from.  It's where you're at.  Fucking Eric B. and Anthony.  Those are some good rhymes.  Yeah.  Yo.  White supremacists are fucking twats, though.  Are they?  Honestly, they are.  They're the worst, man.  They are, because most of the white supremacists are inferior white people. 
[02:02:00]  Those guys I've seen in those documentaries, they're fucking dummies.  They're not white people I respect.  They're not intellects.  They're fucking, you know, they're just lonely little men.  And I've watched them interview...  Singing karaoke alone in their basement?  Nah, but you don't know what they're doing.  Those fucking little faggots that emulate Hitler.  Like, they think...  Well, that's silly.  You know, and the great Fuhrer once said, oh, fuck you.  He fucking marched women and babies into a fucking chamber to be gassed. 
[02:02:30]  Ugh.  What?  When did this happen?  Why wasn't I told?  It was alleged.  You know, Ahmadinejad and I do not believe it, but apparently some people think it happened.  But you know what I mean?  It's like, I have just such a dislike for this fucking cornball obsession with Hitler that  these fucking faggots have.  I'm sorry, I cannot get over the wig on fucking, uh...  Oh my god!  What is that?  He's the documentary.  Ken Burns!  Ken Burns!  He's a Lego person here! 
[02:03:00]  Ken Burns!  It's a minefield of terrors and anxieties.  Oh my god!  What are you doing, Ken?  He's got a fucking Lego guy.  Paul McCartney's 1967 wig on.  No, he ordered that from the Joyce DeWitt collection.  Joyce DeWitt!  Oh, that does...  That's terrible.  What boring documentary is he pushing this time?  You know, that's the one with brains.  Yeah.  Yeah, that one was great. 
[02:03:30]  And one of the baseball ones was all right.  The jazz was good.  Yeah.  The jazz one was good?  Yeah.  The jazz was good.  All right.  Did he use his wig for one of those...  Did he use his wig for one of those things they put over the trumpet?  Some black guy's, like, got his wig in his hand.  And then he keeps it upside down on the table and they put M&M's in it.  And people eat M&M's and cheese doodles out of his wig.  And then he fucking staples it back to his fucking dumb head.  That is hilarious. 
[02:04:00]  What is that?  I don't know.  Bop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.  It doesn't look very natural, whatever it is.  Dude, it looks like he bought it on the way into the studio.  Quick, I need something on my head.  I forgot my hat in the car.  Well, there's a wig store opening in five minutes.  All right, get in line.  We'll walk in with the sales lady.  Grab the first thing you see on shelf two.  What color?  Black, I don't care.  I'm in the elevator.  Get up here quick with my new wig.  No time to try it on.  As they're micing him, he's trying on his wig. 
[02:04:30]  It's backwards.  I don't care.  I'm in studio.  Good enough.  Good enough.  Yeah, they just rubber banded it in the back to keep it on.  Holy shit.  That is fucking heinous.  That thing on his head.  What an awful wig.  Horrible hair.  Oh, God.  There's good old Ken Burns.  We had him on once.  He's a very nice man.  Oh, he sure was.  Yeah, we did a K-Rock.  I remember that.  I saw the pictures.  The joke was, I think, because he was so fucking boring.  I think we all were sleeping.  No, I believe that I just want to tell stories.  Nice guy, though. 
[02:05:00]  I liked that Civil War one.  Civil War was good.  That was a good one.  Perfect.  How about that Civil War one?  Yeah.  I did think it was quite amazing.  How was the baseball one?  I don't know.  I didn't see it.  It was good.  Yeah, the baseball one.  Everything he makes is good.  The Civil War one was good because when you think, they had no film.  I mean, it wasn't film.  So he had to do all that with still pictures.  Moving on the picture.  Moving the fucking pictures around.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, like, zooming in on certain parts of the picture and battles going on.  Like, some flute behind it. 
[02:05:30]  It was the Caneburns effect.  And then they had that one southern guy.  Dear Caroline.  Yes.  Ah, my heart yearns to see you once again.  Perhaps at the end of this atrocity, I shall return to you, my lovely.  For more of your huckleberry pie, my love.  Very eloquent writers.  They were wonderful back then.  Yeah, Shelby Foote.  That was the guy's name.  Shelby Foote.  Yeah, I said, if I was a hare, I would run, too. 
[02:06:00]  You run, little hare.  That guy was great.  They called it the Ken Burns effect, right?  Yeah.  That was a brilliant movie.  People were moving pictures around before him.  Come on.  Not with the depth he did.  They were moving it.  Didn't he do something where he took the picture again and he gave it a background depth?  Yeah.  I don't know how he did it, but.  He made some of the shit pop out.  They use that now all the time where they take the picture, they rotoscope out the guy,  and you put it in a different layer, blur the background out, and if you slightly move 
[02:06:30]  it as you pan across, it looks like you're actually circling around the guy.  What's rotoscope out mean?  They just kind of.  Just cut it out.  Yeah.  Cut it out.  So now it's three-dimensional to the background picture.  Like his head.  Like his head.  Like his wig.  Yes.  Like his dumb wig.  That fucking wig.  It looks like he was running into the studio, and one of the Halloween displays fell from  the ceiling and tumbled onto his head, and he just left it there because he passed himself  in a shiny surface and thought, wow, that looks great. 
[02:07:00]  That is, it fucking is.  One of, James, what was his name?  James Traffic, not James Trafficante, the guy, uh.  Oh, God, the, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not Trafficante, but you know who I mean, the guy, uh, the congressman or senator or whatever.  Yeah, the guy that had that fucking, uh, yeah, it's that fake fucking big hair.  It's horrendous.  What was his name?  The politician.  It's like a shiny wig.  Track, track, track, track, track, track, track, track, track, track, track, track, track, 
[02:07:30]  track, track, track, track.  To my tears.  Senator Tracker.  Senator Tracker.  I said James Trafficante, but I know Trafficante was a mobster, Sam.  Tracker, Tracker.  James Trafficant?  Senator.  Maybe Trafficant.  Yeah, or maybe Trafficant be dispersed because there's an accident or something.  and take it one step farther, cocksucker.  Yes, it is Trafficant.  The Democrat out of Ohio.  There you go, right there.  Wow, that's good hair.  Tim Sabian almost looks like that.  That fucking hair is... 
[02:08:00]  Is it a wig or a comb-over?  That's gotta be a wig.  It's a hat.  What's that cartoon character, the bear?  Remember?  Yogi Bear?  Steve C.  Smokey.  He had that hair and that face.  See, the problem is they put too much up top.  Why would you do that?  You're just building it up.  Just put a little up there.  It's a sandcastle on the top.  You know why?  Because they look in the mirror a certain way  and they just catch it.  Like, they can't see themselves from the side or the back. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  Yes, yes.  Oh, my God.  Why would you do that?  By the way, I realize the guy I've known for years  had a hairpiece recently.  What?  And it's a fucking masterpiece, his hairpiece.  I can't say who because I don't want to embarrass him.  Is he in show business?  No, no, no.  He's not a public.  You wouldn't know who he is.  He's a guy I know.  He's not at all in the business.  So let's blow up his spot.  But Kenny noticed it, too.  I'm like, oh, my God.  That's a fucking...  Do we know the guy?  No.  You know him at a motion.  Is it a hair system?  I don't know.  Does it rhyme with Alan Quinn? 
[02:09:00]  No.  I didn't say people who fucking...  Who need something to be done.  Colin couldn't have a hair...  He's got the Charlie Brown system.  I need a little adjustment.  There's lines on your head.  Yeah, trafficant.  Yeah, this guy's got a really good one.  Yeah, look at that.  Jack.  That is crazy.  Safe for your information.  I love Craig.  That's crazy.  No, but jazz was good.  You would like jazz.  Yeah, I probably wouldn't.  Oh, no.  I don't like jazz at all.  No?  No.  You're talking about Miles Davis a little bit?  Yeah, Miles Davis.  A lot of Louis Armstrong.  A lot of Louis? 
[02:09:30]  Oh.  Well, he's been working hours.  Buncha-jip-a-jip-a-jip-boo.  Exactly.  You don't like that?  I'm not a big jazz guy.  I've said it before.  Sounds like everyone's playing something different.  You don't like when they play their instruments?  Bling.  And the piano player's going...  Bling.  Bling-a-ding-dink-dink.  Bling-a-ding-ding-dink-ding-ding-dink-dink-dink.  And the horn's going...  And the drums go...  It's like, oh, they're playing something different.  Oh, yeah, the bass has got to be doing something.  That's exactly what it is. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, but they improvise.  Fuck improvise.  I can't sing to improvising.  I like a nice toe tapper that I could fucking...  Show Tom what you like, right now.  You want to know?  Yeah, Tom.  Right this second.  You ready for this?  I'll fucking love this.  Fuck yeah.  There ain't nothing else can save me.  Atta boy.  Where you at with that? 
[02:10:30]  It's happy music.  They're all playing together.  In their space age jumpsuits.  Right.  That's great.  They all fucking are playing the instruments together.  Australian optimism.  Sweden.  Sweden.  A super group from Sweden.  ABBA.  Why are they a super group?  They're not a super group.  And now, the super group from Sweden, ABBA.  They're not a super group.  A little song named Dancing Queen.  No.  No, the definition of a super group, where you take all the people from other bands and 
[02:11:00]  make a super group.  They weren't a super group.  Right.  By the way...  Now the poor bastard's like, super group, I'll take the soup.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Did we really...  The Freedom Tower is really shorter than the Willis Tower?  No.  That's a big story today.  We fucked up.  What are you talking about?  They were going for the tallest building in America.  Yeah.  In all of North America.  In all...  Building. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, but I wonder without the...  So then the structures that...  The spire.  Right.  What's the...  We're just short of the Willis Tower.  1776 it's supposed to be?  I hate that fucking...  How the fuck do we fuck that up?  Are we short or...  That's what they're saying on the news today.  That we fucked up.  Where's the Willis?  It's Chicago.  It's the Sears Tower.  It's the old Sears Tower.  Let's call it the Sears Tower.  The locals call it the Sears Tower.  Our thing is 76 stories tall.  But above it, because, you know, is the windmill...  They put the big spike. 
[02:12:00]  Inside.  No, no.  Inside the building.  In case there's a windmill, which will help with the power generation.  The reason they did that, and I get this, it's easy to say they should have built two.  Nobody would put their workforce up there.  I would love to, as a New Yorker, see the big buildings.  But what company, with that target, Chase Manhattan's going to put 600 employees up there?  Does it matter if you're on the 76th floor or the 100th floor at this point?  But it does psychologically, yes.  Yeah, it doesn't?  I think so, yeah, because I think that if you're in the middle of the building and there's 
[02:12:30]  a lot more above you, people feel more comfortable.  Again, after that imagery, no company is putting their people on those top floors.  I would work in it.  I don't think they're going to do that again.  And believe me, I would want you to.  But I mean...  Hey!  But most people are not going to do that.  I think that's the thinking, and it's going to be very hard to rent that space.  It looks great.  So they put the...  I bet not.  We're already fucking kissing Muslims in this country.  I'm telling you.  We forgot.  It's a fucking...  Everyone forgot.  It's a fucking...  Nobody would do it.  Nobody would do it.  Yeah, they would.  You see everyone on the subway, you get a job, you do what you got to do. 
[02:13:00]  Nobody would put their climbing up.  Exactly.  Nobody would put their workforce up there.  I think they would.  But why couldn't we make it the tallest?  What's wrong with us?  Yeah, a couple more feet.  Can we put a hat on top of it or something?  I'll tell you why.  How much off is it?  Because we fucking were caught up in symbolism in this dumb, shitty country, and we want it to 1776.  That's the year!  Hey, yeah!  That's the year!  You fucking assholes.  How about 2,000 feet?  How goddamn dumb are we? 
[02:13:30]  The Tower of Freedom, bucko!  1776!  2,000 feet with the spire.  How about that?  Call it fucking the New York Tower and make it 2,000 feet.  Yes, round it off.  I like it.  I like it.  Can't they just add a couple...  God, yes!  They're just gonna fucking...  They have to!  We should have let Chicago have this.  The tallest fucking building it should have been.  They should glue some popsicle sticks to the spire.  Right.  Make it tall.  It should be the tallest building by far in North America. 
[02:14:00]  Tall than the CN Tower.  How did they just figure that out?  I know.  How did they just come to that today?  They're stupid.  They're stupid.  Because they were obsessed with 1776.  Jimmy's right.  It's so fucking irritating.  So how short is it?  Does anyone know out there?  Embarrassing.  This story just hit this morning.  I don't have any paperwork on it.  Do we have anyone that has access to the World Wide Web?  No.  What is that?  I don't know what that is.  Oh, guys.  It would help your show out immensely.  Did you learn about that on your science show there?  Yeah, it's on my new science show.  Hold on.  I don't want to lose Jimmy's symbolism thing, because there's another story in the paper 
[02:14:30]  that...  All symbolism?  ...that you're gonna love.  Yes.  Guess what the last movie was that was taken out of Blockbuster?  I already know it.  The final movie rented at Blockbuster.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know what that is, too.  Yeah.  I don't know.  This is the end.  This is the end.  Yeah.  I get it.  It's probably rented by an employee.  I get it.  Once the store closes, they're brought right back so they could say that.  Right.  Of course.  Fucking charlatans, creeps.  The Blockbuster's officially done. 
[02:15:00]  Wow.  That's unbelievable.  Remember going in and getting videos?  It was a thing.  Friday night.  Let's get a movie.  It was part of your Friday night.  It was a thing.  It was kind of fun to just be in the store.  Yeah, walk around.  Not just a thing.  It was a huge part of everyone's life.  But you got to see everyone in the town.  You would socialize a little bit.  Everyone got a Blockbuster account.  Everyone was watching this movie.  There was none left.  None left.  Everyone was paying late fees because you were just too lazy to bring it back.  That was the worst.  The worst, having that thing in your car. 
[02:15:30]  I can't drive there and drive it home.  You'd look at it like a fucking monster sitting there like, oh, fuck, it's still there.  Take me back.  It's still there.  Do you remember waiting at the counter for people hopefully returning the new releases?  You ever do that shit?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck yes.  You remember that?  You'd be lucky and go, what's he bringing back?  Yeah.  And they would be so annoyed.  I'm like, no, there's one right in the bin.  And they're like, well, we still got to enter it back into the system.  Put it in the system.  Right.  Put it in.  Fucking asshole.  That's the only reason I'm here.  Give it to me. 
[02:16:00]  And then it was really late.  You'd wait until it closed and put it in the little drop slot.  Oh, with the late one, you'd just be like, yeah, I ain't fucking walking in with this.  Right.  I'm a piece of shit.  They would scold you.  They would.  Oh, this one's late.  Four days late.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, what do you care?  You're not making any money for this company.  Fuck yourself.  I have the same logic with late videos that I did with attending class in school.  I would cut for too many days to even show up anymore. 
[02:16:30]  Like, if you just cut a class one day and you show up the next day, you got to deal with  the fact that you cut that day, but it was okay.  I would be like four days in and be like, now I can't even look the teacher in the face.  Right.  That's how I was with the videos.  I'd look at it and be like, I'll take it back tomorrow.  And then you'd start looking at it going, I can't bring this fucker back.  Now it's humiliating.  This is a fucking, it's like giving the person a note that says I'm a piece of shit.  Right.  Hey, here you go.  Here's my piece of shit card.  Now I'm a freak. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Every video I pay late fees on.  Oh my God.  Hold on.  What?  We got the answer, I think.  It's coming in a couple times, so it's probably right.  Phil in Queens, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Long time listener.  I think you guys are all right.  First time calling.  Whack, whack.  They said on New York One this morning, they said that the tower without the top part of  it is 100 feet shy of being the tallest tower in America.  That's a lot, actually.  Can they just jack the building up a little? 
[02:17:30]  That's probably not much, right?  That's a couple of jacks.  Throw some dirt.  Throw some dirt underneath it.  Prop it up.  That's like 10 stories.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's 8 to 10 stories, probably, right?  I do not see that coming, seriously.  Even if you're into 1776, you're still...  With the spy...  Is it with the radio tower?  Is it taller?  I don't think they count this.  The radio tower makes it taller.  Yes.  Oh, it is.  Okay, they do count that.  Then that's what it was supposed to be.  Too tall.  But the official records, I guess, it's the actual building structure is where they measure... 
[02:18:00]  Sounds like Chicago's getting a little clever.  Not the antenna on top.  No, but with the Dubai tower and stuff like that, they always count the antenna.  Yeah.  Of course you do.  Well, the Dubai tower is pretty fucking huge without the fucking...  Yeah.  And there's also the ability of them to raise that a little bit higher.  They have something in the tower.  Yeah, they're not going to allow anyone to ever beat them.  Yeah, they have something that...  They don't tell you how much extra they have.  I'm going to guess an extra couple hundred feet.  Right.  But they can raise that tower if anybody builds right below them.  It's crazy.  No way.  Yeah.  Who cares if you're on 100 story or 76? 
[02:18:30]  It doesn't matter after 30 feet.  Yeah, exactly.  What are you talking about?  They should have just fucking went for ludicrous high.  Go nuts.  Like where you're running out of oxygen on the upper floors.  That's what they should have done.  Where fucking legitimate airliners are flying past the windows.  Because you're...  Yeah.  76.  Oh, I'm on 138.  Oh.  All right.  Sucks to be you.  All right, Phil.  Thanks for the answer, brother.  Appreciate it.  It looks great, though.  Yeah, thank you, Phil.  I have a view of it from my hotel. 
[02:19:00]  It does look good.  And they lit up the tower.  You can see it from everywhere.  It's unbelievable.  They lit up the antenna the other night, too.  Do they really?  It looked fucking cool.  All red, white, and bluey.  Yeah.  You ever go into the skybox in Chicago at the Sears Tower?  Not the skybox.  What are they called?  Yeah, it might be the glass box.  I know what you mean.  They're great.  Those things are...  Oh, yeah.  When you look down.  Oh, man.  You got it.  Oh, you've done it.  I have done it.  Pretty freaky.  Yeah.  Jimmy did it at night.  I wish I did it at night.  But during the day is better.  It's scarier.  Honestly, it's more frightening. 
[02:19:30]  You're scarier during the day?  It was cloudy when I went to it.  You know me, Opa.  I don't get scared.  A guy who gets scared all the time says that.  And you have to go, yeah, you're right, Jimmy.  I saw a show on how they clean those things.  It's pretty fucked up.  Yeah, the whole thing comes in or something.  It comes in, right?  Yeah.  And then it leaves a giant hole in the side of the building.  It just leaves this giant fucking hole in the side of the building.  But can you get to this...  Can you scoot...  It's a track that pulls it all the way in.  And can you, once it's pulled all the way in, squeeze by it and jump out? 
[02:20:00]  Yes.  Oh, you can.  It's crazy.  Because you've got to clean the other side of the building.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like a goddamn loose tooth.  Yeah.  How is your tooth?  Oh, you know what?  Fucking Steve gets an assist.  Seems like it works.  The ibuprofen worked like a charm.  Nice.  Tooth or period?  All of a sudden, your eyes actually look clearer.  Really?  Yeah, I swear to God.  I was in pain.  Your whole face was like one of those...  A squinty mess?  A little shrunken apple heads.  We were talking about how tooth pain gets you when your eye twitches.  It's the worst.  Whatever side your tooth hurts on, that eye will twitch. 
[02:20:30]  Your whole face.  It's like your salivary gland is just working overtime.  You don't know why.  You feel your heart beating in your face.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your pulse is just there in your cheek.  And then they can't help themselves.  They're looking at the x-ray yesterday and like, oh, your sinuses are clogged.  I'm like, all right, I'm not here for my sinuses.  Your dentist, shut up.  Let me tell you what other parts of you are disgusting.  Right, I'll go get my Benadryl on the way out of here, but help me out with this tooth pain.  But isn't it weird?  Like, all of a sudden, the pain feels way better.  Ibuprofen, I don't believe in this shit, usually. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, sometimes you need it.  All right.  We should break.  Mike Bichetti's here.  You know Mike Bichetti?  I love Bichetti.  It's the best.  Is there a video, by the way, of that fucking...  When they asked, talking about the cleaning of that thing?  I would love to see that.  They showed also when they brought it in and fog moved in.  And the entire floor filled up with, like, fog.  Wow.  Inside?  Inside.  It was fucked up.  Why, because they had the whole...  Yeah, they had the things opened, yeah.  Can you imagine?  Here's what I thought of that.  What would happen if you were cleaning it and someone hit the button?  And it started pushing you out. 
[02:21:30]  Like a Bond villain.  And you'd have to...  As you're getting pushed out, like, as it went right past, you'd have to hopefully grab  the top and hang on and then climb up.  And then what, Jim?  And then what?  Jim, sit there.  But can you imagine how fucking...  Put on your suction cup shoes.  Right.  Jimmy.  That would scare me so much.  It would.  Imagine you're sitting on top of that glass and then it's getting windy and you'd have  to hold on and not get blown off.  How about you're sitting on top of it and then they pull it in slowly so it's just disappearing 
[02:22:00]  underneath you.  Oh, there's nothing you can do about it.  And your friend's just throwing peanuts at you?  Oh, and they're laughing.  Well, it couldn't be.  Your friends couldn't be.  It'd be inside.  But you could see them laughing and pointing.  That should be the next death penalty.  How cool would that be?  Great.  Yeah.  They'd just drop you.  Great.  The next execution.  I can't believe they were in the middle of it.  In the middle of a snowstorm.  Yeah.  Is there any video that's in?  It's crazy.  Not that I've seen.  All right.  We're going to break.  Tom Papa has a lot going on.  Tom Papa on Twitter.  What do I have going on? 
[02:22:30]  TomPapa.com.  You can watch Tom Papa Freaked Out on EpixHD.com.  Netflix.  It's on Netflix now, baby.  Oh, man.  Netflix.  Yeah, it's all over.  So Freaked Out.  I still haven't seen that one.  I got it.  I got it.  You got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got the Netflix.  You got Netflix?  You know that Netflix takes up, what, 53% of the internet?  I was reading today.  Wow.  Video account.  Netflix basically accounts for 53% of internet traffic.  And a lot of that's my special.  No, that's not true.  Video.  Wait.  Video in general, okay, account for 53% of internet traffic. 
[02:23:00]  Netflix alone is one third of all traffic.  Okay.  Damn.  Wow.  Isn't that unbelievable?  It is.  And then you got Come to Papa, his podcast, which is terrific.  We run your podcast here every once in a while on the weekends.  I know.  I always.  And we thank you for that.  I thank you.  I think more people hear it on your channel than the other ones.  Obviously.  Obviously.  It's true.  Obviously.  All right.  And we have a podcast.  Oh.  Once a week, we throw something out there at the people.  What's this week's again?  We got Tim Conway and John Valvey. 
[02:23:30]  People are loving this one.  We interviewed Tim Conway.  What a dick.  No way.  Really?  Yes.  No.  It was funny.  In a comedic way, but also I'm like, I'm looking like, I think he's actually a dick.  Really?  He was fucking with us.  It was great.  He was?  Yeah.  He didn't like any other things?  He walks in like an old man and stands right there.  I'm pointing to the worst part of the room you can stand.  It's the black hole of the studio.  Waiting for us to say something, like, you know, move over there.  He makes believe he's senile.  Right.  And you start reacting to it and you feel bad and everything, and then you realize he's fucking 
[02:24:00]  with you and you're like, you're a prick.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah, yeah.  It was pretty good.  But not.  So we put that up on our podcast this week and people are loving it.  Oh, that's good.  And then John Valby fucking around in the Steinway store, singing really dirty songs in  that uptight environment.  So that's this week's podcast.  That's a good one.  I mean, that's last week officially, I guess, because tomorrow's going to be Patrice O'Neill.  Tomorrow we're putting Patrice O'Neill on the podcast. 
[02:24:30]  Awesome.  Go get our podcast and subscribe.  Is it a replay of something or new material?  What happened there?  Too soon.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we're back.  Oh, yeah, we are.  Damn you.  We got Tom Poppins studio.  We're back.  Should we start promoting the TV show or not really? 
[02:25:00]  Because you're just kind of taping it still.  Yeah, we're taping it.  I just did Soderbergh's The Nick with Clive Owen.  That's coming out soon.  Is that a movie?  Clive Owen.  Clive Owen.  No, Soderbergh is doing a 10 episode thing on Cinemax.  Are you an old 10?  I'm in two.  Wow, very cool.  The Nick.  I have a handlebar mustache.  Takes place in 1910.  1910?  Yeah.  Do you sell elixirs?  Exactly.  Are you an elixir salesman?  I swear to God, that is exactly my part.  Really?  Come on. 
[02:25:30]  I swear to God.  That's hilarious.  I sell, yeah, I sell, I'm trying to sell, Clive Owen's this doctor and I come in, I'm  this snake oil salesman.  I'm fucking around.  I swear to God.  It's just the mustache that conjures up that image.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah, and I'm selling elixirs.  Ah, good for you.  Dr. Corbett's brain food.  Do you have to put on the voice?  A little bit.  A little bit.  I love that whole thing.  Yeah.  Ah, here we go.  Cures, whatever airs you.  Right.  You got anything for a tooth? 
[02:26:00]  Come on, Dr. Thackeray.  Anything for a tooth?  Just last year, Dr. Corbett's brain food.  Yes.  Dr. Pepper's brain tonic made $5 million.  So popular, they're selling at fountains all around the city.  Yes.  As much a beverage as it is a remedy.  Uh-oh.  I'll bet your car has like an arugula horn or something.  Arugula.  Let's get Mike Buschetti in here.  Oh, boy.  Mikey!  There he is.  Oh, my God.  Look at this guy.  Hi, guys.  All right.  What's up, Mike? 
[02:26:30]  Mike.  Take a seat.  Hey, Mike Buschetti in the studio.  Take a seat.  We're on the air.  From the Artie Lang show, of course.  Oh, yeah.  Hi, Mike.  You're still wearing a jacket.  I know.  I love this.  You guys made me cool.  I love the leather jacket.  I started wearing a jacket.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I see that.  And, yeah, we were watching your videos on Instagram earlier.  They're great.  You got a lot of them.  I'll tell you that much.  Oh, Kenny just had me made one for you.  I just made one for you guys.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  You look a little rashy, Mike.  Are you all right?  Yeah, I don't know.  I shaved, Jim.  I cut my...  I don't know.  Okay.  Jesus. 
[02:27:00]  You got to get like a belt sander.  That's better than what I had.  I thought he thought it was poison sumac last night.  It's not, is it?  No, no, no.  I'm good.  Okay, I just shook your hand.  Why don't we get him some...  Him in his sumac-y hands?  Poison sumac.  Who says that?  You just say poison eye.  Oh, yeah.  I know somebody had poison sumac growing up.  It was like...  Really?  It looked like they were Filipinos.  It was so hard, buddy.  It was horrible.  Oh, man.  Crazy.  Were they wet?  No.  Not related to the trend.  No, of course not.  Your razor's dull.  We got to get you like a Dollar Shave Club razor. 
[02:27:30]  I know.  Like those 99 cent things, you know.  You got to change the blade once a while.  That you use 10 times instead of the one time.  DollarShaveClub.com.  That's where you got to go.  I know.  Instead of like...  And you missed a bunch on the side.  Right?  No, no.  It's there on that side.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What, do you shave while you're jogging?  No, it's not jogging, Jim.  No, it's just your point.  Do you just shave while you're laying lackadaisically in bed?  He's laying on his right side of his face while he's shaving it. 
[02:28:00]  Because that's a lot of fur right there.  Oh, God.  Let me see.  Turn the other way.  I know.  It looks like...  No, no.  The other way.  Right there.  You missed almost all of it.  You missed your whole...  Oh, it's in a rush.  I'm sorry.  You're a big star now, Mike.  You got to have a clean shave.  I'm not really a star, guys.  I'm just...  No.  I don't know where I am on the food chain in this.  People got to recognize you a lot more now, though, right?  Walking around town.  It's in the city, yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah?  Yeah?  I just got to find what women think that I'm a...  You know...  What's that?  Yeah, you need a girl.  Yeah, some...  Who doesn't, right?  Maybe in the Midwest, there's like four people in town. 
[02:28:30]  You know what I mean?  Where I'll be big over there.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Yeah, this is kind of...  What do you call that?  It's a small fish in a big pond?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You want to be the big fish in the small pond?  In the small pond.  Right.  There you go.  I'll be a fat fish no matter where I go.  You want to be the big whale in the small aquarium?  You know, I'm so ticked off from my brother.  I said it on my Instagram.  Yeah.  I'm not usually up this early, right?  I'm probably in REM sleep by this time.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm late. 
[02:29:00]  So I said, do me a favor.  Wake me up at six.  I kept, you know, twisting and turning.  Like, you know...  You're still using your mask?  Yeah, that thing sucks.  I hate that mask.  You're about to sleep apnea thing.  Oh, what do you shave with it on?  No, I look like a raccoon when I take it off.  Oh, Jesus.  It's horrible.  Really?  Yeah, he woke me up.  So I said, listen, do me a favor.  Get me up at six.  My thing's at six twenty.  I'm like, that jerk off didn't wake me up.  I'm fucking going to be late now.  There's wet as shit outside.  Yeah.  I don't care how long it would take me to get here. 
[02:29:30]  I would walk here.  You know, I don't even give a shit.  But I'm like, you know, but I'm glad to be here.  Oh, well.  Okay.  So he woke you up late.  That was the gist?  He's still sleeping, that fucking idiot.  Oh, right.  Why does he have to get up?  It'd be funny if he was dead in his bed and you didn't know it.  You just left him there so you could go to radio.  Rocky Dennis.  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah, the elephant man, John Merrick.  I was wondering why all those pillows were piled up outside of this bedroom.  My brother, I actually cried when he died. 
[02:30:00]  I was drinking.  Oh, Jesus.  I was kind of upset.  I was like, who?  Mate, when Rocky Dennis died.  I mean, what's his face?  Oh, I was going to say.  You said, brother.  You're a doppelganger.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I got at least a few of them caulkies from Life Goes On Him.  Oh, man.  Why were you crying when he died?  No, it was just, I was also drinking, though, too.  No, I was fucking.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't like it?  You didn't think it was funny?  He was pulling those fucking pins out of the map?  Oh, because his friend didn't want to go with him anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Ben was like, oh, yeah, you have a fucking six hat sewn together. 
[02:30:30]  You're embarrassing.  Getting a blind girl.  Yuck.  I wasn't sure if Dozer could really talk or he was just, I don't know.  I liked that character.  I'm like a lion.  I'm like a lion.  Fucking yuck.  A dumb lion can't catch anything with his head.  Clayton never happened to Craven for sushi.  I like it a few months ago.  I got a Craven for sushi now.  Let's go for a swim.  Yeah, yeah.  Something that I could strain through my baleen. 
[02:31:00]  Thank you.  If I mistake, I ate wasabis.  I hate hot stuff, right?  Oh, man.  If I mistake, chicks.  Oh, yeah.  He did it.  He did the finger thing.  Yeah.  Let's get some wasabi.  What happens to you if you eat wasabi?  It's like, I don't like, you know, I'm kind of wimpy when it comes to stuff.  Like, I like mild sauce or whatever and stuff, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And I ate the wasabi.  I thought, oh, this looks good.  But it was just like pistachio or something.  Oh, because it's green like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, pistachio paste.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:31:30]  And I ate it.  I'm like, fuck.  I was screaming at him.  I thought my internal organs were going to be fucking ham.  Wasabi's not really hot like pepper hot or anything.  It just, it's your sinuses.  Yeah.  It cleans your nose out.  You're like, oh, your eyes start tearing.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  I got a huge nose, though, Anthony.  That's why, you know, it just went right up to the...  Well, it doesn't really stand out.  It's all relative, I guess.  I never noticed.  Thank you, buddy.  I appreciate it.  I love watching you guys. 
[02:32:00]  I love...  Who wouldn't?  I love firearms myself.  I see a lot of guns on the net.  Oh, yeah?  You ever go shooting?  Yeah.  I used to go to range all the time when I was shot.  Wow.  You're a good shot.  That would scare the shit out of people.  It would be awesome.  You'd be like, he's the guy.  He's the guy.  Yeah, Anthony, I love it.  I went, when I was in my...  I got my permit like a 25.  Yeah?  I had it for a couple of years.  I had a...  What state?  Oh, this one.  New York?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh.  It was a little easier than to get guns, I mean, here, but, I mean, you know...  What county, though?  Upstate?  It's that I own. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, it's like a rifle and shotgun permit.  Oh, okay.  That's different.  Okay.  I thought you meant a pistol.  I wish.  I never shot a pistol in my life.  But I had a 12-gauge shotgun.  It was awesome.  Jesus.  Of course you knew.  He put it in his toothbrush holder.  No, but I almost broke my jaw with it the first time.  I was like...  Whoa.  It was cocky.  You're trying to shave with it?  More shaving jokes?  Trying to shoot the hairs off it?  No, I thought...  Would have done a better job.  Holy shit.  I thought it was John Wayne.  I was like, you know...  Oh, well.  Gacy?  I didn't realize... 
[02:33:00]  Oh, God.  I just got that now.  Yeah.  You almost broke your jaw.  Yeah, I had it close up.  Too close up there when it...  And it was like, boom.  And I was like, whoa.  Yeah.  But I haven't tried a gun since like the 80s, I think.  You would do all right with a broken jaw, though.  Me?  Yeah.  I'd lose a lot of weight that would probably be...  Well, that's sort of what I was getting at.  You better be a complete dick.  Wire that jaw shut for a little while. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, they won't see.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's weird, though.  I mean, like, people get that stomach staple, all that stuff.  It's like, lock the fucking refrigerator, fat pig.  I mean, we need a fucking band around your stomach for a minute.  Well, that's tough.  The refrigerator door opens.  Are you eating more now that you're famous?  Oh.  Oh.  It depends.  My taste buds got a little better now, you know?  Like, I mean, you know, I got rid of Wendy's and started eating sushi.  I thought I got, you know, hip.  Oh, wow.  Nice. 
[02:34:00]  What kind of sushi do you like?  I like sashimi.  Yeah.  Yeah, really?  He's on Boardwalk Empire.  You need the rice.  He's all...  I love him.  Shishimi.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I'm going to be immense.  Wait, oh, God.  Sorry, guys.  I'm a little slow and dry today.  It just sounded like...  Oh, you're doing great.  I don't know.  We asked you to bring...  We asked you to bring three things in today to talk about.  Okay, cool.  Did you make your list?  Yeah, yeah.  My handwriting's horrible. 
[02:34:30]  You guys will probably laugh your ass.  What three things?  One thing is about what's going to happen to our mayorship now.  I mean, this is...  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  What else?  Topical, very good.  Obesity.  About how fat we are today.  Okay.  Pull that one out of thin air.  It's random.  Talk a little bit about bullying, if that's cool.  Bullying.  Especially with the NFL now.  It's like, whoa.  Wow.  Those are three great topics.  Which one do you want to do first?  Topical, I would like to hear his take on the mayor.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:35:00]  Just, you know, a little take on...  Okay.  Might as well.  We got de Blasio.  Yeah.  Bill de Blasio.  Right.  Who's...  What are you thinking?  He's a bit of a lefty.  Oh, boy.  Far left.  I like...  The thing is, like...  He's a communist.  Let's, you know, put that right out there.  He's pretty much a high, I'm a communist.  And the city's been running very well the last few years.  No complaints.  Especially, no complaints.  He wants to take it in a new direction.  Right.  He doesn't like the direction we're in.  Yes.  He doesn't.  New Havana.  I don't think he will, though, because...  Oh.  It's too much money, because, like with Disney, right, they're billionaires here now, right? 
[02:35:30]  They're not going to put up with some idiot trying to get them... put them on the...  Oh, yeah?  I mean, the city, you know what I mean?  You think Disney's going to send out their hit squad?  Yeah, Disney's going to send out...  Their fucking hit squad of animatronic assassins.  Yeah, with white gloves on.  Yeah.  Three fingers.  Fat fingers don't fit in the trigger guard.  Goofy would guard him.  Oh, that'd be good.  That's true.  Yeah, Goofy showed me.  That would be funny if de Blasio goes in to meet with Disney, and Mickey's there and 
[02:36:00]  stares at him and pats his hand, and then Goofy's knife right in it, and they choke him out.  Yeah.  No, but I'm saying, because I think whoever comes in now, the city's been so good for  years, that it's going to foul things up.  I mean, like, you know, Disney's not going to lose any money.  These people here now put so much money into the city, they're not going to mess around.  You know what I mean?  So what power will they have over the mayor?  If the mayor is such a socialist or communist that he wants to do things regardless of what 
[02:36:30]  big business says, what could they possibly do?  I think it's all about the dollars, no matter what we do with this.  Ah, the almighty dollar?  Maybe they could make a problem for him.  So what do you mean?  Like, criminally, they could, like, pay some people off?  Or maybe contribute money to groups?  I think once, you know, Bloomberg's leave, so those bicycles that he put up here, you  know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  I hate those fucking things that he'd try.  Of course not.  They're adding another 4,000 more, I think. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, no, please.  They're adding like 6,000.  They're adding another 4,000.  I hate them, too.  Me, too.  I'm like, listen, Jericho, buy a fucking bike and drive it in the city.  They're running people.  Yeah, drive it yourself.  Yeah.  Today with the wet is horrible because, like, I thought it was all umbrella people.  Oh, yeah?  In the city.  Where were you?  Philippines?  There's a lot of umbrellas going on.  I hope he said it earlier.  I think it's a little late for the umbrella.  Because the people who walk around with umbrellas, it's like, yeah, that's a little late.  Well, the bikes do take up a lot of space there, Mike Bichetti. 
[02:37:30]  A lot of space.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, sometimes you get a lot of people driving, like, I call them  Euro trash.  Oh, shit.  Where did you get that one from?  Whoa.  No, just like, you know, like, drinking that $12 Frappuccinos driving a bike and, you know,  like, belittling people.  I don't really like it.  Belittling people.  All right.  I hear you.  I don't like those bikes either.  Not so much for the bikes, but for the places they put them.  They put it on, I think it's 60 or...  Taking up lanes. 
[02:38:00]  47th I come down or 48th, whichever one runs that way.  And they have it right when I turn off a third onto 48th.  And this fucking thing leaves me barely any room to do, like, 80 through because I got  to make the light by fucking Park Avenue.  Don't fuck with me.  And I hit the gas and it's like, I'm beeping the whole way because there's people crossing  the street.  Going to the bicycles.  But it gets real close.  One day I could wipe out a lot of bicycles.  Or people. 
[02:38:30]  Or people, yeah.  It wreaks havoc.  You're right, though.  You're driving, you know, like...  Isn't it nice having people on bicycles?  No, it's not.  Yeah, in the park.  Yeah.  No pollution.  Yeah, no fucking commerce.  Getting around.  No driving quickly to the cellar.  Right.  It stinks.  Places to be.  What do they call those?  Those...  The bicycle with the seat.  I was going to get in one of them.  The bicycle.  With the seat?  I'm sorry.  It's called a bicycle.  As opposed to the one without one that you prefer?  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  What a waste of time that seat is.  Yeah.  They called it with a chopper, but it's just...  It's got a fist.  I mean, uh...  What the hell is that thing where they have a seat in the middle and it's a bike, it looks  like a rickshaw, but a bicycle and those things.  Oh, the rickshaws?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, the pedicabs.  Yeah, let me give you one of them, but I don't know if I'd fit in.  Break his balls.  Yeah.  No, you'd fit in a pedicab.  See, that's different.  For a pedophile.  I'm driving halfway to the city, break his balls a while. 
[02:39:30]  Boy, imagine him walking through the pedicab area and then they're scattering.  They're all looking down on their cell phones.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm busy right now.  Oh, wow.  You need a fucking centaur to fucking pedal it for them.  See, because they get those giant animal legs.  Meaty thighs.  Those guys are shaking down people, though.  Oh, yeah.  They're all like Russian, right?  A ride could cost either $10 or $5,000, depending on who you get.  I've gotten into many a verbal spat with cab drivers. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, okay.  No, with cab drivers.  Right.  And cab drivers will back down, like, 99% of the time.  Yeah.  You'll just be like, fuck you, you piece of shit.  Fuck you.  And they're like, fuck your mother fucker.  But they won't do anything.  Right.  I got in a little bit of a spat with a pedicab driver.  This fucking guy is like, you want to fucking fight me, you cucksucker?  He's a fucking Russian guy.  Wow.  And he was like, this guy is not going to back down.  Are you in your car?  No, I was standing on the fucking sidewalk.  The same guy kept going back and forth, and he kept asking. 
[02:40:30]  He's like, 20 times.  He's like, you want?  You want?  I'm going, I'm fucking going 50 blocks.  No, I don't.  Stop fucking asking me, you asshole.  He's like, asshole?  Hey, fuck you, you mother fucker.  And I'm standing there like, uh-oh, this guy's going to go.  And then I noticed there's some cops across the road.  So I was like, ah, yeah, what's the officer?  He's over there.  You know.  I hate bullies like that, Anthony.  I hate idiots like that. 
[02:41:00]  I should fucking bring that idiot back to his third world country.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Get a table.  You're rough.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  I just like seeing people be bought at my charcoal office.  In Russia, petty cab ride you.  I don't know.  All right, so that's good shit on the new mayor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about the police in New York?  We're a little scared about this new mayor.  I know.  Ray Kelly's out.  He's fucking, he's saying he's not even going to stay until the transition.  Yeah.  He wants fucking, he does not want to be in charge under that mayor. 
[02:41:30]  And guarantee they're going to put some, you know, really lackadaisical police commissioner in there.  They're proposing that the cops could actually be sued.  Yes.  What?  If you arrest somebody and it turns out that they're off, they could actually sue the officer personally.  So why would you do your job?  We're right.  Why would you do your job then?  He's an anti-cop fucking twat.  Yeah, he's a real douchebag.  They're really worried about, they're confusing which way it's going to go and whether or not 
[02:42:00]  they're going to be able to do their job the way they did.  Because the way they handled crime in this city is the reason it was able to be pretty  prosperous for 20 years.  Yeah.  That's like the dam that's holding back the water of destruction.  It's insane how little crime there is.  Yeah, yeah.  Insane.  A city the size of New York, you look at places like Detroit and Chicago and Atlanta, you know,  those are big cities that have huge fucking crime problems.  But New York is like, because you ever see something, something happens in like, say, Detroit or even 
[02:42:30]  Atlanta or something, you look and you go, wow, the police are kind of trying to figure this  out and there's people over here and they're sending a few cops over there.  New York is like, they don't even let things get out of control for the most part.  They send people, they know what they're doing, they know exactly what they have to do to keep  a crowd in check.  And that, I mean, that keeps a lot of problems from happening, you know?  Yeah.  You don't see many rioting, not many riots going on.  There were more suicides than murders. 
[02:43:00]  Really?  Last year, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So let's change that.  Let's go to...  Yeah, let's see if we can step that up.  Let's change the crime and the economic situation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mike, what do you got on the NFL?  And the bullying.  Oh, the bullying.  And the incognito.  Now, you're a guy that's probably been bullied in your day.  Why do you say that?  What?  Why do you say that?  I would think growing up in school, were you a larger gentleman as a kid?  What are you saying?  I'm saying he's got a few extra pounds on him, Jim. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What did they call you in school there, Mike?  Oh, it started...  They called me Grasshopper in the first grade.  What?  I couldn't, like...  I wasn't too...  Smart?  No, no.  That's one part of it, but I mean...  Oh, my God.  Well, he pauses it.  I know.  No, but...  You can't pause in this show ever.  Huh?  Oh, you weren't very coordinated.  I was like, I'm still not really, but...  Yeah, yeah.  I was spastic.  They were laughing at me.  When you're in school, what were you in ballet class?  Who cares? 
[02:44:00]  I know, but they, you know...  What does Grasshopper have to do with that?  Yeah.  Just the way I would...  We were supposed to do some kind of bullshit May dance in school.  I don't know.  I wasn't doing it well, and they were laughing at me, so...  Because you moved like a Grasshopper?  Can we see the dance?  Yeah, let's see the dance.  It was a dance?  No, like some kind of bullshit thing they had us doing in school.  I hated school from kindergarten all over to high school.  Yeah, but what was the dance?  Yeah, that's school.  I don't know.  We had to dance with a partner, I think.  Like square dance?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was hard.  Swing your partner?  Things like that?  It's been a long time, but they also, what do you call it, my brothers loved playing pranks 
[02:44:30]  with me growing up.  They broke my balls all the time.  They're younger than me.  Oh, yeah?  So one day...  How does that happen?  You're supposed to beat the shit out of your younger brothers.  I did, but...  Fucking Fredo.  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  How did that work out for you?  No, but they would gang up on me.  They were the same age, like a year apart.  Jesus!  So I'd have to fight two of them instead of one guy when we used to have drunken punching fights  growing up.  Oh, wow. 
[02:45:00]  But, no, they would do things like, one time they unscrewed the light bulb in my room  and thought it was funny to throw tacks down on the floor.  They filled it with gasoline and screwed it back in.  Yeah, that's kind of funny.  No, but you know what happened?  That's kind of funny.  I fixed their wagon really good, though.  Well, why'd you fix it if they did something so bad to you?  No, but they got their asses beat after it was so funny what happened to them, because  my dad was...  Oh, that's funny.  My dad was still living at home right at the time.  Uh-huh.  So I figured, yeah, I'll be getting even with these idiots because... 
[02:45:30]  So I screamed at the top of my lungs like I was having a heart attack.  Oh, shit.  Dad!  So he came in a room and stepped on the tacks.  Oh, that's smart.  And then he's like, who the fuck did this?  I was like, those two spirits did this.  Oh, man.  Oh, they got a beating.  Damn.  I mean, and also, you know, like, I was always a lazy, fat kid, too, like, growing up.  No.  Come on.  I was like, my grandmother would, like, you know, have us do stuff.  She was like...  Oh, no.  Would you live in a tenement? 
[02:46:00]  Not like fucking everyone's there.  No, she would, like, you know, like, have a house, and she'd be like, can you help me  paint the back stairs or whatever I'd sell?  Jesus.  On purpose, I would fuck up.  I knew I could do the job.  Could you paint my pussy with your tongue?  Holy shit.  Oh, grandma.  It's good whitewashing.  Like, again?  No, I'd just fuck up.  I'd be like...  Oh, my God.  I'd, like, throw paint all over the place, make it look like I screwed up.  I wouldn't know what I was doing.  Yeah, yeah.  So they got to do the work, and I got out of it.  Oh.  Yeah, but you got out of it, but at what cost? 
[02:46:30]  She thought I was an idiot, really.  See?  Is that worth it?  No, I was worth being an idiot.  Oh, that was worth it.  Those idiots were sweating their asses off while I was inside drinking soda, you know?  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe you should have been outside not drinking all that soda.  That's, again, at what cost?  Getting out of that work.  No, my brothers and guys were brutal.  They would, like, throw, like, sand fleas on my bed one time.  What?  Sand fleas?  Where did they get that?  Believe me, they got all kinds of shit growing up.  Your novelty shop? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, well, you'd find sand fleas for your little prank.  Here's some sand fleas.  Right, sand fleas and fake vomit.  Have a good time, boys.  If you have sand fleas, you need this elixir.  Some new rejuvenation liniments.  Yeah, liniments.  Wow, fuck, sand fleas.  Yeah, they like breaking balls.  And they had me...  That's not breaking balls.  That's right.  That's blatant abuse.  Right.  That's child abuse.  Yeah, that's abuse.  Why don't they like you?  They just were jargops growing up.  Yeah.  So how does it make you feel about this whole NFL bullying, then? 
[02:47:30]  Are you on the...  They said it's locker room culture.  This is something that just happens.  It's part of football.  It's part of the locker room jock culture thing that people don't understand.  They see it as being cruel and obnoxious and offensive, but it's commonplace.  No, it's taking a thing.  These guys are football players.  They're warriors.  It's like...  Well, slow down.  They're like their own empire.  They're gladiators.  They're out there.  They want to take your face off on the field.  They shouldn't be...  Oh, my tummy's hurting me.  You know, that's bullshit, really. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  You've got to man up a little bit and take the punishment.  Well, couldn't you say the same thing?  That's coming from the grasshopper.  Yeah, the grasshopper who was square dancing and very unquist, stepping on the poor girl's  feet.  If he can take it.  There's some girl in a wheelchair right now.  How did that happen?  When I was square dancing, sixth grade.  Yeah, she has feet like a Mad Magazine character.  I mean, it's like...  How far is it going to go after that?  I mean, you know, like, it's football now.  What are they going to do to do that to the military one day?  I mean, you know... 
[02:48:30]  Well, they were already taming down the military and saying that they can and can't do certain  things.  Not like the old days.  Not like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  I know.  I love Gunny.  Oh, who doesn't love Gunny?  I know.  They just could bring him back.  I know.  It sucks.  Choke yourself!  Those are the good old days.  Now, you know, he'd probably be sued.  No, you're right.  It's crazy.  Now, like, he cursed me.  Let's go to the office.  Right.  That's considered, like, bullying.  Yeah.  I know.  It's not right.  But, I mean, bring back the old days.  I miss those days.  But you were bullied in school.  How do you like that? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, the old days sound terrible.  You missed the stepping on tags.  Oh, my God.  No, when you can, like, laugh.  Sand fleas.  Sand fleas.  You missed the sand fleas.  You covered in sand fleas.  Sand fleas.  With bleeding feet.  Bring back those days.  Who the fuck thinks about bringing sand fleas in a bag?  The good old days.  The good old days.  How many bites did he get from the sand fleas?  Oh, I was fucking, I looked like Alfred E. Newman.  I'd all shit over my body.  It's like.  Fleas are brutal.  Those were the days. 
[02:49:30]  Fleas suck.  They are the worst.  You can't catch them.  They're just, they're a nightmare.  But, you know, I mean, the good old days, like, when you can laugh and have fun.  I mean, like, something like the Frito Bandito.  I thought it was hilarious growing up.  Now, you can't even.  Oh, you wouldn't have the Frito Bandito anymore.  No.  That was, he sold the Fritos corn chips.  It was a cartoon character called the Frito Bandito.  Yeah.  No, no.  Look, he's really cool.  From the, like, late 70s, I think.  What made him so cool?  Just the way he would.  Ay, ay, ay, ay. 
[02:50:00]  I am the Frito Bandito.  Could you imagine that now?  Yeah.  What the fuck is he saying?  Yeah, no.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, they couldn't get to fucking the phone quick enough.  They wouldn't even watch on TV now, guys.  If there was blogs back then.  This Frito Bandito is very offensive to the Mexican people.  He's violating my culture.  Yes.  They wouldn't even let the phones on TV now.  What?  Why?  Because he'd be in hate mail for women's groups.  Oh, I just snap in his finger.  Oh, because of what he did to the, ay, deliquisto twins or whatever the fuck. 
[02:50:30]  I was trying to bang some guinea fucking twins on that show.  Pinky Tuscadero.  Yeah.  Oh, Ross Kelly.  I know what I'm exactly.  Why?  Yeah.  Did you like Pinky Tuscadero?  Yeah, Pinky gave me.  Leather or Pinky?  Which one?  Leather was kind of cool.  Leather did that.  Yeah, that was cool.  She did the thing with her hands where she'd do that pew pew thing.  Yeah, I was like...  It's a very Bouchette-y move.  Pinky was more the older one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Leather was the younger one.  They were both ugly, though.  They didn't pick hot broads. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, you're right.  They're like the 70s.  They were hot enough.  Yeah.  You know who had the worst fucking girlfriend or dates on fucking TV and should have had  better ones, but they were always a little too old for them and just very average, if  not below average looking?  Jack Tripper from Three's Company.  He'd be like, oh, I got a date tonight.  And this girl would show up and you'd be like, is this like a friend of the producer that  wanted to be on the show? 
[02:51:30]  So, he was never with like a really attractive girl on that show.  They were always like too old.  Someone the director could score with.  Yes.  Yeah, a little haggard.  But that older woman who came on and got me hot.  What's that?  From Mrs. fucking...  Roper?  Yeah.  Mrs. Roper.  Helen Roper.  To get into her moo-moo.  Yeah.  Mike would go like, I know she's...  Stanley's not fucking her.  No, but I mean the other one.  Lana, I think her name.  Yeah, Lana was sexy. 
[02:52:00]  Did you want to eat Laura...  What was her name?  Lindley.  Something.  Audra Lindley.  Audra Lindley.  Oh, yeah.  She was Mrs. Roper.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  You like her?  Yeah.  You know, she'd probably have a good hand job, I'm sure.  No, she wouldn't with those fucking old weathered ring hands.  A handy from Mrs. Roper.  You're reaching high.  Mr. Roper just sits in the corner and does that laugh thing that he used to do.  She's always mugging for the camera with that laugh. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Big cuckold face.  Like 1930s, like, you know.  All right, what else were we going to talk about?  The obesity in America.  Obesity.  Yes.  Well, you know, they're always talking about obesity, but they don't give us a lot of choices  when you think about it.  Now, this is a subject that's close to your heart, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little too close.  Oh, God.  I mean, like, you know.  Oh, God.  It's blood-filled walls.  Like, this weekend I was in Pennsylvania, I was away, right?  Oh.  And, you know, the only thing I had was, like, fast food stuff. 
[02:53:00]  So I basically.  It's hard.  Took the bread and just made myself a half a chicken thing with some.  Things.  Yeah.  I mean, I just took it and put it on the side.  Half a chicken thing.  I just took the bread.  The bread is brutal.  I haven't had bread or soda in almost three weeks now.  Whoa.  Wow.  You've got to update your Instagram, because last we looked, it was seven days.  That's right.  I know.  What are you drinking instead of a soda?  Just a lot of water now.  Yes, right.  That's good.  Water.  Cum. 
[02:53:30]  You've got to change it up once in a while.  I've got to pee on my back.  Water by itself is incognito sometimes.  Yeah, yeah.  You need a little flavor in there, huh?  Wow, that's pretty good.  You lost weight?  You've noticed a difference?  I lost, like, nine pounds.  Good for you, man.  Nice.  But what about obesity?  What do you got on this?  It's hard to eat healthy, is what you're saying, when you're on the road and out there.  But you know what?  It starts with even kids.  I mean, you see kids that are, like, two, three, you know what I mean?  Way, way overweight.  And their parents are, like, you know, they don't have time for them. 
[02:54:00]  They're, like, you know, taking and replacing and just everything moves quick now.  You know what I mean?  They're, like, taking all kinds of shit food and they don't even care.  You know what I mean?  And then you've got a 200-pound kid on your hand.  And how do you start?  I mean, kids.  What would you do if you had a 200-pound kid on your hand?  I'd try to get him to work out and just get him healthy if I could.  Do you work out?  I'm going to start walking soon again.  I love to go.  Oh, yeah?  It's a good start.  I'm going to start walking soon.  It's a hell of a goal.  So you're going to trade your card in? 
[02:54:30]  There's a short pier down the road.  I'm going to start walking again.  Aren't you doing that already?  Not really.  Not really.  I like goals that people have.  The hell of a goal to have.  I'm going to start walking.  I'm going to start breathing again.  You know, I just...  Forget the triathlons.  I had gone to the gym.  Fuck that bike shit.  I'm going to start walking.  It's not I am walking.  I'm thinking about starting.  What does starting walking entail? 
[02:55:00]  Just getting out of...  You know, walking past my block a little bit.  You know, then starting.  All right.  You know, starting.  I had walked for like...  I used to walk for like about an hour and a half a day.  That's nice.  But now it's...  I got lazy.  I started, you know, eating bad food and just got super fat like usual.  Oh, boy.  It's just...  It's the thought process, though.  In your brain, it changes everything.  It's how you think.  It's not just the food.  Right.  Well, it's...  You should...  What about thinking about running?  Oh, God, Tom. 
[02:55:30]  My knees are horrible.  Oh, yeah.  I think I would probably like...  Why are they horrible?  I have to do a lot of falling probably.  A lot of falling.  How many calories you burn falling?  I would think the getting up part is probably...  I don't know if they have an app for that yet.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you count the calories falling?  I think so.  I remember meeting you.  You weren't heavy.  No.  I know...  We know each other a long time.  Yeah, I am.  How long would you say?  Oh, God.  Probably 15 years?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, we go back a long time.  And you weren't heavy.  No. 
[02:56:00]  Unfortunately, I was kind of a decent-looking guy, maybe.  I don't know what...  Yeah, you were.  ...what decent is now, but...  So were you getting the ladies?  Were you putting up some numbers back then?  I made out with a couple of female comics.  Made out with a couple of female comics?  Yeah, female comics?  Which ones?  They're always known to be very pretty female comics.  Well, they were all open micers.  I don't even know if they're still doing that.  Right.  Open micers.  Right.  I chased the open mic a few years ago.  It was cool.  That is good.  So down at home, I'm like, you know, like...  I just thought of working with the Garciate, all kind of shit.  You know, you got...  He was like a...  He would just be on stage in like a t-shirt. 
[02:56:30]  Just like a tight t-shirt.  He was in...  Really?  You were in tight t-shirt shape?  Yeah.  Fuck, dude.  Yeah.  I know.  You know, I just turned into a blob.  Was there a moment?  Was there something that happened?  A tragedy?  Because I watched that show, Intervention and Hoarders and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah.  There's always some fucking thing.  Yeah.  They were fine.  It's like, oh, she was fine until like the fucking dog died or something.  Sometimes women can bring you down to your knees.  That happens to me. 
[02:57:00]  Well, yeah.  They're my kryptonite.  The trick is to do it the other way around.  Are you in a relationship now?  No, I just want to get some major cash and just chase whores after that.  I don't want to even bother with...  You don't want to...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Just have...  You like going with whores?  So you're thinking first you get the money, then you get the power.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you get the women.  Well, but you got to be careful with the money because like I don't want to wind up like  Mike Tyson's fucking some skank.  Well, you got to get the money before you can blow it.  Tyson's coming here tomorrow.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no.  Can I keep it on the artist show?  No.  Oh, we should. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, we never should.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  My job will be wired for like eight years now.  I was just saying one of your...  Then you'll lose weight.  I was just sent one of your Instagrams.  It's okay to be yourself as long as you're not hurting other people.  Be yourself.  Be cool, man.  Be yourself.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be a sheep.  Be a leader.  It's okay to be yourself as long as you're not hurting other people yourself.  That's nice.  Yeah, I believe that.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd. 
[02:58:00]  Words of wisdom.  I'll probably be a rubber band, I guess.  I don't know.  Why are you showing the rubber band in your Instagram?  Maybe.  My wrist?  I don't know.  I got to just...  Is that like a thing where you snap the rubber band if you want...  People at OCD have that, yeah.  If you want a bread or something?  If you're thinking about having bread, you snap that rubber band.  There it is.  Yeah, but I was starting to Jones the other night.  Or is it a final like a guide for a straight razor?  I got to believe.  How was Jones with you the other night? 
[02:58:30]  For Brad?  Tom?  I do that sometimes.  It's not unusual to be loved by you.  Yeah.  I was like, my bed looks like...  I'm sleeping in bed going, my bed looks like a fucking roast beef sandwich.  What's opening in the neighborhood right now?  You know what I mean?  Your bed looks like a roast beef sandwich.  I was like, fuck this.  Clean the sheets.  We don't have to recharge the way I live.  That's not mayo.  Yeah, or gravy.  Right.  Oh, shit.  I spilled gravy on the bed once.  You did? 
[02:59:00]  Of course.  Of course.  Holy fuck.  I like eating on the bed.  Yeah, that's probably not a good thing.  No.  You can see the TV from there.  I don't even watch TV.  I would assume if you're eating in bed, you're not then getting up to work it off.  Yeah.  My wife's done it.  I'm going to get out there and walk.  Well, we heard about this.  We heard tell about this.  You're still talking about it.  That you're...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm out walking.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's good. 
[02:59:30]  You're off to a good start.  So you like prostitutes more than regular girls?  Kind of in a way, because...  They'll fuck him.  What kind of prostitute do you get?  What quality?  Oh, I got to tell you, that's funny, because...  I got cock-blocked at a fucking whorehouse with my friend years ago.  So I want a pair of glasses?  That's funny.  That's funny.  Wait. 
[03:00:00]  Thank you, James.  So I got...  He cock-blocked me, because it was this, like, really pretty girl, and I was going to go  for any...  And he grabbed the first.  I'm like, fucking idiot taking that whore that I wanted.  You know what I mean?  I'm upset by it.  Did you eat her pussy right after?  No, no.  Oh, God.  So I took another one, like an older housewife type.  I figured, okay, I'll settle for this.  You know, there's nothing...  I don't want to wait here all day for her now.  You know, he just fucked her, and I've got to wait for her now.  But what happened was, a few weeks later, when he, you know... 
[03:00:30]  Uh-oh.  What happened was, now, now, every time he went to the bathroom, he fucking...  He was like, ah!  Oh, shit.  You know what I mean?  The doctor had to lift his prick up with a popsicle stick after that, and then shoot him  with some kind of shit.  I don't know what the hell you call what he got, but I was like...  Some type of sexually transmitted disease?  Yeah, just by, you know...  I was like, good, you fucking cock-blocker.  Ah, see?  It worked out in the end.  And your housewife, when, was clean?  Uh, I think she was. 
[03:01:00]  She was like...  Well, you didn't get the dick disease or anything, right?  No, but when we used to go to this place...  Jell-O come out?  You know, after going to this place, I would put my dick in peroxide a little bit, you know  what I mean?  What?  No, just, you know...  Make the hairs blonde?  Just to clean it.  Just to bleach.  Yeah.  Just to make sure that, you know, that things are still going to work good the next day.  You think that's a good thing to do?  Well, it's weird, because I go in a whorehouse and do not want to take a shit in the toilet  because they're afraid of catching something.  Who shits in a whorehouse? 
[03:01:30]  Why is that even an option?  It depends what you're eating on the way there.  Wait, would you actually go in there and shit before you saw him?  No, no.  Oh, my God.  I wanted to make sure you got all that out of the way before you walked to the front  door of a whorehouse.  I'm not shitting in this fucking spanking place.  Why would you?  Nobody would shit in a whorehouse.  No.  Have you ever shit in a whorehouse?  No.  And then you're not fresh, you know?  No, if I had to, no.  No, but did you ever feel the urge to shit and hold it?  I'd rather fucking shit in the sidewalk in the middle of the day.  Wait, so you went into a whorehouse, you had to shit. 
[03:02:00]  When you're walking.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  You went into a whorehouse, you had to shit.  Uh-huh.  And you went into the bathroom before you saw the whore and debated going?  No, I thought about it, Jim.  I'm like, fuck, these whores are bad enough.  I don't want to catch anything on the fucking toilet, you know?  But were you going to shit before you saw one, if you could?  Uh, no.  I just, but Jim, some of the ones were cute, though.  And this place was, like, in downtown, but it was only ten bucks in those days.  Ten bucks?  But we're talking about, like, Tom, like, the mid-80s.  Right.  Right.  Everything was good in those days. 
[03:02:30]  Bullying, $10 whores.  No, it was great.  Sand fleas.  But I usually stayed with one woman over there all the time, that I, my special, she was  like, I was like about 25 or 26, she had to be, like, twice my age, just like housewife  from Buffalo, I think.  You like older women?  A housewife, an older housewife from Buffalo.  She was stacked.  Wow.  She was stacked.  She was stacked.  What tits in that whore?  That's great.  Like, whoa, I fucked the tits when I was awesome, that fucking skank.  Yeah.  She's probably, like, 80 years old now, though. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And still fucking wiping her tits and crying in the shower.  She's still washing her tits with fucking a driveway scraper.  Well, one girl, awesome, from Peru.  My name is Elena.  She was awesome.  Yeah?  What made her awesome there, Mike?  She just, she growled me.  She had a nice toilet.  One of those short Peruvian girls that wear the derbies with a fucking bag of coffee over  her shoulder.  Yeah.  Thick and small.  Thick and short.  Yeah.  That's the way I like them. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  She built like Herve Villaches.  Yeah.  Perfect square.  Yeah, hair like Ken Burns' wig.  If she fucks up, you can threaten with the green card, too, you know what I mean?  You don't have to, like, put up on your shit, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  But she, uh, she was standing there, like, with a red dress.  She was snacked.  I looked at her, and she goes.  I love that.  She growled at me.  She goes, car.  So I'm like, this is my woman, baby.  Wow.  She was a hooker?  Yeah.  And what'd you do?  Did you fuck her?  Oh, God.  It was, Jim, it was fantastic.  It was fucking, uh, I still think about her occasionally. 
[03:04:00]  She sucked your prick?  She sucked it like it was falling off me.  She was so like, that little skank.  That wouldn't be a good idea.  I love that saying, but it's like, she sucked it like it was falling off me.  Yeah, but then that means that your prick was falling off like a leper, and she just  sucked it gently, and it fell off.  No, but I just love pushing that fucking head down, rubbing the head, you know, like,  like a basketball, you know?  Yes.  I don't understand why the long-term relationship hasn't worked out.  Oh, I do.  I know.  Oh, my God. 
[03:04:30]  He's a catch.  That is great.  It really is, Mike.  When's the last time you went to one?  Oh, God, Thomas.  Me or one?  Oh.  The 80s were like your peak, but do you still go now?  No.  The game has changed, Tom.  What are you going to do?  Bloomberg.  They can't just hold their head down like that anymore.  They want, like, rights and respect.  Fuck that noise.  The Peruvians have regular jobs now.  Peruvians.  Yeah.  They're asking for more money ever since they've sent all that money to cure their cleft 
[03:05:00]  palates.  Peruvians.  No, but, you know, plus, you know, when you think about it, even some high-class car  girls aren't, hookers look beat.  I'd rather have a nice woman sometimes.  Oh, yeah?  Like a regular girl.  Occasionally.  The girl next door.  Is that a...  Friends with benefits.  Friends with benefits.  But you don't want the hassle of a girlfriend.  No, you know, I don't want her to be both hagglers.  Telling you what to do.  Yeah, yeah, I don't like being ordered what to do by a woman.  Making you not eat in bed.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I just want to eat in a... 
[03:05:30]  Imagine that.  What are you doing?  Stop eating that.  You got gravy on the bed.  Why does it smell like roast beef in here?  Oh, and you'd just be like, shut the fuck up.  Blow me and then get the fuck out, right?  That's right.  Shut the fuck up, you whore.  Just do your job yet.  Oh, whore that.  It's your girlfriend you're talking about.  Yeah, Mike.  It's your girl.  You gotta know the difference.  Choke in a fucking banana and shut the fuck up.  Oh, jeez.  Whoa.  That's not going to help the obesity problem. 
[03:06:00]  No, but I...  You know, like, uh...  I kind of...  Like I said, I love...  Chicks are kind of tough.  Well, you like...  Yeah, they've got to take it to stay with you.  Oh, you like...  Like, like, uh, Pinky Tuscadero.  Yeah, like, woman to come on here.  Like, I love them the best.  You know, you know what you're getting right away.  Instead of, like, dealing with all bullshit, talking to them, and, like...  You don't want any of that emotion bullshit?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, feelings here.  You want some pussy, and that's it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I second that emotion, Jim.  Absolutely.  I'll give you feelings.  Spread them. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Right?  You want a feeling?  How about you feel my prick in your mouth?  There you go.  That's a good one, too.  I'm going to get that...  Yeah.  I feel a fucking load of cum in your mouth.  It's my motto.  Put on your t-shirt.  He wants that as his motto.  Yeah.  Oh, I love it.  Yeah.  Oh, it's that fantastic.  Mike, what's up with the Tubby Man web series?  Oh, that's cool, Anthony.  Me and my friend, Ken Barrester...  Whatever.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Why?  No, it's okay.  I screwed up.  I'm an idiot.  I'm so sorry.  Yeah, it's all right.  Don't worry about it. 
[03:07:00]  What do you call it?  We created it a while ago, and it's about a fat superhero.  Oh.  Against the Tubby Man, but the reason I made him fat was because...  Well, because you are.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  No, I would love to know why.  I can't understand why you'd make him a heavyset hero.  Why, Mike?  Right, sorry.  Give me 420 reasons.  I do apologize.  I just...  He's a superhero.  Yeah.  Everybody's like, you know, used to seeing guys like Captain America, you know, Superman, 
[03:07:30]  Spider-Man, right?  See those ones everywhere.  Iron Man.  I just saw him.  Spider-Man?  Spider-Man.  Down the village.  I actually got upset by Captain America.  I was like...  Why is that?  Who isn't?  At the end of the movie, I was like, where's that horse?  She left him in the dust.  He's an old man now, you know what I mean?  I didn't see it.  Thanks.  Wow, that's nice.  Spoiler alert.  Fuck, I'm sorry.  Oh, well, what are you going to do?  No, but...  And I thought he'd be fat because, you know, a superhero's not perfect.  Everybody has flaws, you know what I mean?  Oh, kryptonite. 
[03:08:00]  Superman's got kryptonite.  Batman's got that fucking bullshit with his parents that he can't get over.  12-foot sandwiches.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I got a 12-foot something else.  Oh, Spider-Man.  What's Spider-Man got?  Web stuff?  Yeah, but what's his fucking, like, foible?  Oh, you know what?  He can't be in love with that girl.  Oh, Gwen Stacy.  Because with great power comes something.  No, it's not that.  It's what happens is her queefs affect his chemistry because they smell and his web comes out all fucking awful and doesn't stick. 
[03:08:30]  Her queefs throw in his web.  I don't remember that part.  Yeah.  So the kryptonite is, like, fat.  Yeah, but I want him to stick up for all kinds of people to get bullied on, you know?  Like, especially kids, it's horrible with them on the net now because, you know, I mean, you've got kids hurting themselves, jumping off, I mean, it's ridiculous.  It's not like the old days, you get some tacks on the floor, and now you've got to do it.  Right, right.  Now.  Yeah.  Now it's crazy.  That's on the World Wide Web.  Right.  I know.  So it's a fat superhero that saves kids from the Internet? 
[03:09:00]  Well, no.  Is that what I'm grasping here?  No, no, you guys got to see it.  We put it up on Blip TV.  It aired yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  What was the first story?  Yeah, give us a synopsis.  Donnell Rawlings plays my dad in an episode.  He's black.  That's interesting.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good choice.  And then there's this really hot girl, Amanda.  She's awesome.  She's, like, half my age, but she's...  What's wrong with that?  You know, and I get all, like, flustered around her.  Did you fight any bad guys in the first one? 
[03:09:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, well, I got beat up in the first one.  You got beat up yourself?  But I'm going to come back to do justice.  I, you know...  Oh, who beat you up?  So, I was walking down the street, you know, coming from the grocery store with a couple  bags full of bananas.  I was walking down the street.  These guys go, hey, banana boy, and they started beating me up.  Oh, man.  Why do you need so many bananas, though?  Just have a rating on it?  Because with language like that, I don't even know if the kids should be watching it.  Good point.  Banana boy.  Good point.  No, but we, uh...  I also did a PSA for an organization called Bullies Keep Out, which is cool. 
[03:10:00]  Bullies Keep Out.  A PSA.  What'd you say?  As the superhero?  Yeah, I was dressed in a costume.  Oh, okay.  Oh, let's hear how this sounded.  I think it was like, um...  Did you change your voice for Tubby Man?  Uh...  Yeah, what's Tubby Man telling you?  Just like me, pretty much.  I mean, you can't really change...  I don't have, you know...  Let me get a little deeper.  Standard American English.  I wish that I did.  Do people recognize you when you're in civilian wear as Tubby Man? 
[03:10:30]  What is Tubby Man dressed like?  Well, it looks like a Teenage Mutant Gangbanger.  That's the costume we had in the list.  Teenage Mutant Gangbanger?  Like, uh...  What do you call it?  Is there a picture online?  I gotta see what it looks like.  Who's directing this?  Yeah, yeah.  What is this?  A friend of mine had worked for Howard.  Jake Hatz.  He worked on Howard TV.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  It's good, though.  We had some cool people in it because...  I gotta see this.  It's fun.  I gotta see this.  Yeah, it sounds good.  On Blip?  Oh, yeah.  You can go to Blip or SaveMeTubbyMan.com. 
[03:11:00]  And how long is the first episode?  Uh, six minutes.  Six minutes?  That's good.  Usually it should be like five, really, right?  Guys, you think?  Yeah.  No, the extra minutes.  The extra minutes is good.  Yeah, quality like that, you want to add.  What are you...  What are you...  TubbyMan, Defender of All Sandwiches is on YouTube.  Oh, cool.  We do.  We don't have...  I don't know.  No one's in here right now, so...  Defender of All Sandwiches.  I would like to see that.  TubbyMan, hero of the underprivileged, the bully, that everybody was rattled, picked  on in school from day one.  He's an anti-bully hero. 
[03:11:30]  I love TubbyMan.  He's going to just put idiots in their place, pretty much.  But he's a hero for the under...  Everybody's an underdog, and now he's super anti-bullying.  And he can eat a sandwich fast, but he can also take care of the villains as well.  This is a manifesto, by the way, that will be splashed all over the news when that happens.  Oh, boy.  Yes, children were found with their fingers bitten off, and a local man known as TubbyMan. 
[03:12:00]  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  All right, that sounds cool.  Yeah, well, you know, it's a noble cause right there.  I love helping people.  Do you?  Totally, absolutely.  He's got a big heart.  How about you start with yourself?  Oh, yeah.  That's the most important person.  No, you're right.  You've got to want to be yourself and then other people surround you.  Yes, yes, and then, you know, and then other people will follow.  You know, they'll see that you have what is called self-respect.  Oh.  Indeed.  Thank you, buddy. 
[03:12:30]  That's awesome.  Bravo.  I might have to Instagram that.  Oh, I see a TubbyMan costume.  I'm on Save Me TubbyMan.  What's on the front?  It's going to be a big hit next Halloween.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, you look kind of like a gangbanger, but then you have the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle  mask on, like that mask.  That mask was horrible, guys.  I thought I was going to, you know, it broke on me, actually, when they were shooting.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  How did the mask break? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  It was too tight.  The guy who gave it to me, like...  Well, of course it was.  A lot of things are too tight with me, like my shoes, my socks, everything.  Your asshole needs to be loosened up.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Nobody goes, yeah, that's cold enough.  No, no, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  That ass belongs to me.  Nobody else really.  Wow.  TubbyMan.  What's this, though?  TubbyMan.  TubbyMan.  First episode.  Oh, nice. 
[03:13:30]  Looking on the street.  Look at bananas.  Who did the theme?  My friend's musician.  Hey, why don't we see it over there?  Let's go over there.  Sam Roberts is going to take the helm.  Oh, you don't have to move there.  Do your duty.  I thought Sam would just sit on Tom Papa's lap.  SaveMeTubbyMan.com.  Mike, you're panicking.  Sit down.  What was Mike doing?  Mike's getting off.  He's like, I don't know.  No, this is about you.  You sit.  You got to move.  I got to.  No, I just don't want to, you know. 
[03:14:00]  What was that?  All right, here we go.  You're good.  Here's the episode.  Oh, here we go.  We'll watch just a little bit of it.  Let's go full screen.  Thank you so much, guys.  We're trying to get you some eyes.  Oh, is that the girl that, wow.  I can't see Sam.  Yeah, right there.  That's it.  Oh, yeah.  Nice thing.  Okay.  Okay.  Wow.  Professional.  Yeah.  Like the logo. 
[03:14:30]  By the way, did you guys pay for those aerial shots of Manhattan?  Uh, I don't think they did.  There he is.  Walking down the street with bananas.  So fast out here with his bananas.  Oh.  Yeah.  Out of nowhere.  Oh, they're bullying you.  You got David Lee Roth.  Oh, my God.  They're punching your heart.  Leave him alone.  Come on.  Get out of here. 
[03:15:00]  Hey.  Are you okay?  Oh, no.  The fat kid got full.  Who's that hot chick?  That chick used to be a dude.  She used to be a dude?  Yeah.  Does she have a dick?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, forget it.  Worthless to me.  All right, now you're coming home with the bananas, right?  And your roommate said, you're living with a homie.  I can't, man.  I got bullied.  No.  Same punks.  Same kids.  Punks?  Punks, yeah.  I got bullied again.  Pushed bananas.  Every time I go out.  Why all the different bananas? 
[03:15:30]  They took my bag off me.  No offense.  Right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's just bad, man.  We got this little stink apartment.  You want a banana?  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, okay, cool.  Hey, man, you think that, uh...  Oh, God.  I got a shot with Mandy.  She's hot, man.  Mandy from the job?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, chicks like that don't go for guys like us.  Oh, this is sad.  Oh, tender moment, Mike. 
[03:16:00]  It's real.  Now we fade to the next scene.  Oh, look at that.  A little establishing shot.  I know I haven't seen you in a while, and it's not right.  But you're the only one.  I'm the plan that I can tell.  I love you.  You're my dad.  When's the last time I seen you, son?  I keep getting picked on at work every day.  I can't take it anymore.  Bullies are beating me up on the way home every day where we're living.  Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted in one  moment, would you capture it? 
[03:16:30]  Or would you just let it slip away?  Hmm?  Dad, I'm pretty sure that was Eminem.  What do you know about Eminem?  The last time you saw Eminem was in a bag and you ate it, son.  And this girl, dad.  I really love this woman, and she's way out of my reach.  She'll never go for me.  Son, let me tell you something.  I love you.  But always remember, the sky's the limit, and you've got to keep on, keep on, keeping on.  The sky's the limit. 
[03:17:00]  And you've got to keep on, keep on, keeping on.  Birthdays was the worst days.  Now we drink champagne when we're Thursday.  Maybe your firework.  Come on.  When's the outfit?  Let your colors burst.  Make them go, oh, oh, oh.  Dad, look, I appreciate your advice.  But that last one was definitely Katy Perry.  I got a feeling that tonight's going to be a good, good night.  Ooh.  I got a feeling that tonight is going to be a good, good, good, good night. 
[03:17:30]  You remember that?  I will.  I got a feeling.  I love you, kid.  I love you, Dad.  All right.  Oh, look at that.  That was, uh, he was in the wire, of course.  Oh, look at this.  Some stock footage.  Aerial shot of New York.  Pay for that?  Hot girl.  Fuck yeah.  Oh.  Um, that's quite a pin.  Oh, thank you.  It came with my dress, actually.  Thank you.  Oh, it's okay.  Uh, do you like working here? 
[03:18:00]  Uh, it's great.  Who does that big, fat tub of goo think he is?  Yeah.  Everyone's so mean.  Talking to a beautiful girl like Mandy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That mic is possibly the dumbest idiot in the entire world.  Jesus.  I hate his face.  I hate his giant head.  Oh, giant head.  I really can't stand his disgusting baloney breath. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Nitwits like that have no business getting anywhere near a girl of that caliber.  Yeah.  He shouldn't even be talking to her.  Guys like me get with girls like that.  Yeah.  And I'm going to get with that.  Yeah.  That guy's a go of shit.  Wow.  Horrible.  Hey, maybe one day we could, um.  Ah, forget about it.  Oh, no. 
[03:19:00]  Forget it.  Oh.  The sweat.  You got flux.  I'm seeing the sweat.  This is the porn.  I love a big, round man with stretch marks on his belly.  Uh-oh.  A big, round man with stretch marks on his belly.  Mike?  Mike?  A little fantasy scene there.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  I'm going to get a bacon burger.  Okay, I guess I've got to get back to work. 
[03:19:30]  But enjoy your bacon burger.  Bye.  It's like 20 minutes.  Oh, marshmallow.  Take a look-see over there.  You see that fine girl there?  Yes.  Good.  I thought this was six minutes.  Amy, so don't even try.  I think, right?  Stop hitting.  Do you turn into a superhero?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm the only one who has a monkey.  Oh, so there's no superhero in this episode.  No superhero?  Wait, hold on.  Pause this.  Who's that nanny chick?  Do you fuck her?  Uh, she's hot. 
[03:20:00]  She's a friend, but unfortunately, you know.  Why did you bang her?  Is she a boyfriend?  No.  I took a queen song out.  How old is she?  She's like half my age.  Would you eat her ass?  No, well, you know.  You suck her toes?  Do you jerk off on her?  Kiss her?  No.  She's such a prick for money?  Feel her tits?  Yeah, do you smell her hiding?  He looks at her, though.  He's got a crush on her.  He does.  He's turning really red.  How old is Mandy?  She's got no boyfriend, right?  She's single?  I feel like I'm in the witness protection program. 
[03:20:30]  Answer himself.  Oh, man.  Do you ever jerk off thinking about her?  Yeah, that's, you know.  Oh, wow.  You want to lick her puss, don't you?  Suck her tits?  Yeah.  He's getting all embarrassed.  I bet when you hired her, you had fantasies that she'd be like, hey, he's the big boss.  I have to suck his cock.  That equation came in.  Wow.  I got a web series.  Casting couch, right?  Yeah, yeah.  A little casting couch.  Sure.  You ever jerk off thinking about her?  Thank you.  Thanks for the opportunity. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, man.  Sucking your balls.  What do you imagine?  You know me a lot better.  What's the best thing you imagine doing with her?  Yeah.  Fucking her in the ass?  Rolling her on a carpet when you're finished and disposing of her?  No.  Oh, wait.  What is it?  You want to cum in her hair?  Yeah.  That's always a good one, you know.  Yeah.  Well, Tubby Man looks exciting.  Oh, thanks.  I'm all in.  It's crazy.  It's SaveMeTubbyMan.com.  I want to see what Tubby Man looks like in the outfit. 
[03:21:30]  I'm all in.  I'm all in.  How many is she in the whole thing?  She's in the whole series.  Yeah, of course she was.  She must have jerked him off.  You're not dumb, man.  Does she jerk off?  She's very sweet.  It's like she's...  The unfortunate thing is like...  What happened?  You asked her out?  What'd she say?  No, I never...  I just...  He's professional.  Yeah.  You got to keep your business.  Oh, man.  What about her boyfriend?  I don't know if she has a boyfriend.  Probably she's a gorilla if she does.  Probably like big guys.  Come on now.  Why didn't you ask her?  I don't know.  I don't want to mix this with that. 
[03:22:00]  You know what I mean?  Well, it's like...  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, I probably do.  Oh, of course you do.  I'm kind of a wimp sometimes with that kind of shit, but you know...  Ethics...  Ethics be gone.  Yeah.  Be damned.  Just shove your fucking dick in her.  Teach her who's boss.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, but I...  I'm like that with hookers, but I can't be like the regular woman for some reason.  Oh, fucking go down on her.  No, no.  I'm just saying just...  Would you suck her feet?  No, I'm not that kind of...  I don't like feet.  Would you let her finger your ass?  Oh, no, no.  Like you said, my butt...  Oh, no.  How about if you were on your stomach and she was just fingering your ass angrily? 
[03:22:30]  Oh, I'd be fucking so pissed off.  I'd walk out of the room.  What?  You don't do that to Tuffy, man.  No, no.  I'd be like fucking fucking hands off me.  That's his kryptonite.  Oh, yeah.  And like...  You lose his strength.  Would you let her lick your asshole and then kiss you?  No, no, none of that ass stuff.  How about put a strap on and fuck you up?  Oh, oh.  What about her ass?  What about you sticking your tongue in her asshole?  How about if it stunk a little?  Uh, a little bit.  Just leaving razor stubble on her butt cheeks.  Just get it shaved properly. 
[03:23:00]  When you jerked off thinking about it, was it her sitting on your face or you making love  to her or her blowing you?  Uh, she just got done cooking me dinner like in a French maize outfit.  A French maize outfit.  Bending him sandwiches.  Oh, my God.  He has hack fantasy.  I know, right?  Yeah.  Then I looked at nudie playing cards.  No, but I really...  I was delivering pizzas for sure.  I would love to have a woman like...  I love woman in uniform like those tough chicks.  Oh, yeah?  Like a nice stacked...  A woman in uniform.  Stacked. 
[03:23:30]  Officer, like...  Like a man.  Yeah, like...  Like fucking...  Like dead Russian soldiers.  In uniform and stacked.  Like a female drool instructor.  Like that kind of chick.  They'd be like...  Like fucking concentration camp victims.  In uniforms and stacked.  Yes.  That's terrible.  I look at them in big striped pajamas.  Holy shit.  I mean, just like a tough chick.

Yeah, I'm telling you, you know.  You'd be the expert.  Nick Cannon.  Mama's baby, papa's maybe.  So you have your kids, the complexion of your kids is fairly white?  That's what we call it. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  How old are they now?  Light-skinned.  Two and a half.  Okay.  So you haven't had to explain to them racial differences just yet?  Not yet.  I think that generation's not really going to care.  All of those kids are beige.  Yeah.  When you look at it, like every new kid.  They all got something mixed.  Right, right.  There's like that whole purity thing.  That's out the window.  Sorry, KKK.  It's not going to happen.  Yeah, like they don't have to confront like racism until they get way older and have to  deal with even older people.  Yeah, but everybody except like everybody's mixed with something. 
[03:28:00]  Everyone has something in them.  There's no pure race anymore.  It's the same thing as the gay thing now.  Like nobody's got a big coming out story anymore because everybody's like, yeah, whatever.  Yeah.  Like I'm trying to live my life.  I don't care who you're sleeping with.  I just do it in your bedroom is your business.  Yeah.  I don't care.  Who's the more firm parent?  You or Mariah?  Definitely me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely me just because I'm daddy.  You know what I mean?  You got to come in.  Wait till your father gets home.  Yeah.  It's all that.  I got the loudest voice in the house. 
[03:28:30]  Right.  And especially because my daughter.  Not as melodic.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Not as melodic.  Unfortunately.  My daughter is everything that you would think a little girl is supposed to be.  Just sweet, innocent, loves mommy.  And then my son is like just grimy and needs discipline.  So that's kind of like my job.  He's the one like he'll headbutt you as soon as he meets you.  Like he's that kid.  How do you keep them from being brats?  Their mom and dad is Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey.  You know what I learned?  And I'm just learning this because they're only two and a half years old. 
[03:29:00]  But because of course they're going to get, you know, the world and have access to many things.  Of course.  But you never give them what they want.  How's that?  You give them what you want to give them.  You know what I mean?  If they come and say, hey, I want an Xbox.  No.  You just don't get it.  No, you get like a Nintendo.  Whatever's three degrees lower.  No, but you give it to them when you want to give it to them because that's the thing.  No, you know, it's all tangible items, but it's about the importance that you put behind them. 
[03:29:30]  And if they think that whenever they request something, they can have it in life, then that's when you're creating spoiled brats.  But if you can say, no, you'll get this or you got to work for this.  So when I believe you deserve it, that's when you should have it.  Right.  Like just to remind you, like everything that you want, I'm the filter.  Exactly.  It all comes through me and I make that choice.  Now, I would imagine you got so much going on.  Yeah, it's a lot going on.  But are you home all the time?  Because you have.  All right, let's go over this list. 
[03:30:00]  All right, here we go.  You now have your own award show.  Yes.  You've been, you had your own radio show, which by the way, you must be so glad to be out of radio.  I'm thinking of coming back.  Really?  Sirius XM.  I'm going to be somewhere in this building.  My God.  You're mad at seeing me every day.  I would love it.  You got the DJ thing going on.  And I have to tell you something.  Yes.  I saw you DJ.  Yes, you did.  And we were all like, yeah, he's probably no good at DJing because he's this famous guy that just gets there because of the name.  Yeah.  You had the whole place moving for three hours.  Yeah, man.  Like, you do it for real.  That's what I do. 
[03:30:30]  I actually was DJing in high school.  So, I mean, I was one of those kids that with the two techniques and the crater records and all of that stuff every weekend.  So, it's been part of my life for a long time.  But so, now you've created your own award show.  Yes.  This is the fifth year.  Right.  It's the Halo Awards.  It stands for Helping and Leading Others because, you know, I'm over there at Team Nick.  I'm the chairman.  And early on, we came up with this idea where we wanted to have the network stand for something.  And it was all about youth empowerment. 
[03:31:00]  So, I was like, yo, forget all these other award shows where celebrities kissing each other's butts.  Right.  Let's go ahead and put it all the way out there.  It's about the community and the young people.  Let's shine that light on them instead of all of the celebrities.  So, we still have the celebrities.  I mean, every year we've had everyone from, you know, Lady Gaga to Justin Timberlake, LeBron James.  You're going to let Richie Incognito present an award?  I mean, why not?  Why not, right?  Let them know.  It's all fine now. 
[03:31:30]  There's no more beef.  Right.  Everybody's on better terms now.  So, that's Sunday the 17th.  Yeah, it's going down this weekend.  The Fantinic Halo Awards.  This year we've got Queen Latifah, Josh Hutchinson, Chris Paul.  It's going to be really cool.  My God.  Then, you have a comedy special coming up.  Yeah, that comes on the day before the Halo Awards.  Now, how do you, you know, you've got on one end, so that's Saturday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's on Showtime.  Yeah.  So, on one end, you're trying to promote this, let's help each other, and let's see the kids do well thing. 
[03:32:00]  And then on the other end, like your comedy, you can't be that wholesome in your comedy, can you?  You know what it is?  It's one of those things.  I think people, because I always say I'm not a role model, because a role is something that you play.  I'm a real model.  A role is something that you butter.  Yeah, brum-tum-tum-tss.  I can open for you if you want.  He's here all week.  Yes, yes, yes.  So, you're not a role model.  No, but I mean, at the end of the day, I'm a 33-year-old man, so I'm going to talk about 33-year-old man things.  But, of course, I still represent and love to empower the youth. 
[03:32:30]  Do the Nickelodeon people, they try to get their hands in the other stuff that you're doing?  No, not really.  I think early on, like, if I would have been talking about the things that I'm talking about now when I was 19 on Nickelodeon, they probably would have had an issue with it.  But, I mean, I'm such a fixture in the game to where they know what it is, and they know the core of who I am.  You know what I mean?  So, it's kind of like even like your movie roles.  It might be one movie that I'm in that's rated R, and then another movie that I'm in that's, you know, rated G. 
[03:33:00]  You've never had any of these salacious scandals really with you.  Not really.  And you've been a star since you were a kid.  Yeah, I mean, again, it's about just moving properly.  Not really, like, dabbling in everything, you're supposed to be, but too much of anything is always bad.  So, no matter what it is, whether it's drugs, sex, don't overdo it.  So, a little bit of drugs, a little bit of sex, a little bit of work, and that way nobody really picks up on anything. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, it just balances out.  I saw when Mariah had her big song this summer.  Yeah.  And she was singing with, what's his name?  Miguel.  Miguel.  Yeah.  And she was like on some haystacks singing love songs to Miguel.  I was sitting there thinking about you.  Right.  Because you know you're always close to my heart.  And I appreciate that.  And thinking that that would drive me crazy if my wife was sitting there singing to Miguel on some haystacks like they're in love. 
[03:34:00]  Not really.  I mean, there's so many factors into that.  To where, one, I love my wife, and I love when my wife looks sexy.  I mean, that's kind of when my Mariah posters were on the wall, that's how she looked.  And, you know, I was never jealous of the guys in the video then, so I'm not now.  And then it's like, come on, man.  Like, when you know you got home tight, you're not worried about anything else.  I got you.  So you don't have to sit in the studio watching.  Like, let's make sure this chemistry doesn't go to a certain point.  Really?  I mean, Miguel's my man, but really, he's not intimidating. 
[03:34:30]  You're not threatened by him?  Yeah.  Like, if it's some other people out there.  Who would you be threatened by?  I would probably be threatened if, like...  Idris Elba?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If he...  Like, that dude who was on the haystack with my wife, I'd probably be watching a little closer.  Because he could do every different accent you can think of.  Exactly.  And he's a DJ.  Yeah.  So you'd be in a lot of trouble.  Exactly.  What is this that you're wearing here?  You look unbelievable.  Don't...  Oh, my God.  Don't let me bring him out on there.  Did you get those shoes from Liberace? 
[03:35:00]  I wish.  His would probably have, like, diamonds on them.  You have to be quite comfortable with your masculinity to wear purple socks and glittered loafers.  That's what they are, right?  Yes.  Yes, absolutely.  With fur on the collar of your jacket.  Oh, yeah.  Jacket, the fedora.  I was a pimp in my former life.  I don't know.  You look like a 1930s pimp.  Exactly.  Which is when pimps still looked cool.  Exactly.  They got all the way...  70s, everybody got confused.  But from the 30s to about the 60s, they were the dude. 
[03:35:30]  It was good.  Absolutely.  Where do you find these clothes?  You know what?  I'm a connoisseur of fine haberdasheries.  I just, wherever it is, wherever in the world, I try to have something unique on.  I need more people in my life that use words like haberdashery.  It seems more culture than anything I'm used to.  Well, they're already wrapping you up.  Oh, man.  Our time has to go.  So short.  But yeah, so the fifth annual Halo Awards are on Sunday at Nick at Night.  Yes.  And that's the one where you get to see the kids be empowered. 
[03:36:00]  Yes.  And then Saturday.  Saturday is the comedy special on Showtime.  Where we're saying F the kids.  How do comedians feel about you doing stand-up?  I know there's some comedians that think you need to pay your dues more than you have.  See, who are those comedians?  Because if you're a real comedian, you know that I've been doing this since 1992.  Okay.  And you know what I mean?  And anybody, you know, I came up in a game with cats like Jeff Ross and like, you know,  like Chris Tucker, Chappelle, you know, I opened for Chappelle, all of that stuff. 
[03:36:30]  Did Chappelle like you?  I mean, he gave you the seal of approval, right?  Exactly.  I mean, early on, I met Dave when I was like 14.  And, you know, he kind of took a liking to me because he started when he was that young.  And you do have a little more of a comics mentality than a typical actor mentality that comes in here.  I mean, the last time you were in here, I ran down a list of every radio bit you did that I made fun of.  And you were right there with me.  Absolutely.  You weren't getting weird, you know, Hollywood-y on me.  Nah, that's what it's about, man. 
[03:37:00]  I mean, at the end of the day, at my core, I'm a stand-up.  So there's nothing you can say that can really offend me because I'm going to usually have something to come back.  So, all right.  Well, watch the Showtime special Saturday, 8 p.m.  You'll be back on America's Got Talent.  Of course.  Wiling Out.  Yeah, Wiling Out is on.  When you come in, you got to come check us out over there.  I will come by any time.  Absolutely.  We start shooting in a couple of months.  Sounds good.  I'll be there.  All right.  Nick Cannon, thank you so much.  We'll take a break.  Yeah.  We'll be back.  The ONA Show continues.  Sort of.  This is After ONA Live. 
[03:37:30]  Stay tuned.  Sirius XM.  And now, The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Oh, I like that.  What did you think?  The stars were going to stop flooding in?  I didn't know Nick Cannon.  I guess he was late for some other shows.  And I was like, fuck yeah.  Nick Cannon's always welcome in my house.  We had our beef for a while.  But ever since, I don't know, I gained a whole level of respect. 
[03:38:00]  Nick Cannon came in here.  And we used to make fun of him because he used to do the radio show on 92.3 Now, which  was what K-Rock became after we left.  And so he was the prized possession of Jocktober.  I mean, I used to kill him all the time.  I would listen to his show, even outside of October.  I would listen to his show constantly just to find things to make fun of him for and just  be running in here with my next Nick Cannon bit.  He came in here one day, a couple years ago, and I started running down my whole list of 
[03:38:30]  bits that were terrible that he did.  And he was sitting there, right, making fun of him with me, justifying him.  I was like, once you do that, you got my respect.  Which is great because, you know, I mean, I'm self-deprecating myself.  Right.  You got to be.  Mike Pachetti is back.  I was telling the audience that you seemed like you got confused after the show and you  left, you took a lap around the building.  I was like, wait a minute.  Oh, did he?  I forgot.  I was like, I'm so excited, Sam.  I'm sorry.  That's all right. 
[03:39:00]  Don't even worry about it.  Take a load off.  866-WOW-1-WOW if you want to call in.  We didn't have time to take any calls when Nick Cannon was in here.  What did you think of Nick, Eric?  Great.  He was good, right?  Those shoes are amazing.  He was wearing, he came in.  I thought they were like Michael Jackson shoes, but they're purple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  They're purple, like, sequins.  You saw them.  Oh, no.  Did you see them?  He came in here.  He was wearing a fedora.  He was wearing a trench coat with, like, fur on the collar.  Oh, she had.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He was wearing, he had a three-piece suit on. 
[03:39:30]  Whoa.  And he had sparkly purple shoes with purple socks.  Would you ever wear something like that?  The fedora, yeah.  Everything else.  Not the glitter shoes?  No, not really.  You don't think you could pull that off?  I don't think they have, like, an 11 wide wide.  Is that your shoe size?  Yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  What kind of shoes you got on, Mike?  Oh.  Mike Machete's in here from the Artie Lang show.  Thank you, Sam.  These are supposedly.  Oh, yeah.  Get that leg up.  Yeah.  What kind of shoes are those?  I think they're supposed to be some kind of balanced shoe. 
[03:40:00]  I don't know.  Do you fall down a lot?  I fell a lot with them.  They're lying.  You do.  You do.  You do.  Oh, crap.  I like the suit of life out of them.  I fell more times than I did, than anything.  Right.  You're just walking down the street and all of a sudden.  Yeah, I'm taking a spill, you know.  That sucks, man.  And it must be tough for you to get back up.  Oh, Sam, forget about it.  But you got to, don't you?  Yeah.  You know what?  I should be a bodybuilder.  You know how long it takes me to get out of bed?  How long?  Get a lift of my body.  Oh, it's a lot of weight.  Yeah.  You're a lifter.  Yeah.  Let me go to Will in Pennsylvania. 
[03:40:30]  What's up, Will?  Hey, guys.  I thought I was going to Russia real soon.  Really?  Yes.  Oliver Stone thinks they won World War II.  Well, I'm actually going to Cabrera, which is about 19 miles from China.  Why are you going to Russia?  A family friend actually is taking me because she's from Russia, and she actually offered  to take me with her.  Hmm.  All right.  So what's your question?  What would you do if you went to Russia? 
[03:41:00]  If you went to Russia?  I mean, for me, I'd probably buy a new furry hat, but I'm going to leave this to the much  more traveled, much more cultural, Mike Bichetti, Mike.  Thank you, Sam.  That hat would be cool to get, first of all.  I like those fur hats.  Like, I would learn how to make bosts and, like, all the eastern pierogies, all things  like that.  First things I'd be going for.  What about the Russian girls?  Oh, man.  They're beautiful.  You like the Russians?  Very nice.  What would you do to them?  They're beautiful.  I don't know. 
[03:41:30]  They're kind of tough, too.  They wouldn't take any crap off me.  I saw my P's and Q's and be a gentleman for a while.  You think so?  They got to know me.  You wouldn't tell them to just jump on the pole?  Oh, no, no, no.  I'd be afraid of them snapping my pole off.  Okay.  Yeah.  Watch out for that, Will.  Don't let them snap your pole off.  Well, what I'm actually going to do is I'll be there for about a month.  And when I get there, I'm actually going to probably try some of the vodkas there they  have because, you know...  You like to drink, Mike, or are you not a drinker?  I've been sober since 97, Sam.  Congratulations. 
[03:42:00]  But vodka was cool.  I used to like Jack Daniels.  Brown liquor was good.  That was your poison?  It was definitely poison, Sam, for sure.  I'll bet.  Lady Trucker.  Hey, Mike.  You seem to be a wonderful commissary of the ladies.  So I was just wondering, how many women have you slept with?  Mike, how many women intimately we're talking about?  I used to have a trice with my friend's best friend's sister for years on and off.  You used to have a trice with her?  Yeah, like, you know, like friends with benefits in the old days.  I loved that, Sam, so much.  Gotcha.  Was she a dirty girl? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, to me.  I don't know how many other people she was dirty with, but you know.  Right, because you were just a friend with benefits.  There was no relationship.  It was just like, when I feel like being a filthy pig, let me invite Mike over, and he  likes that.  I liked it, but after a while, you can get attached to it, though, if you're not careful.  You gotta watch.  Is that what was happening with you?  Yeah, I started getting emotional with it, and I'm like, I don't need this crap.  These games of the heart can be very complicated, can't they?  Oh, yeah.  So what happened?  How do you keep yourself from getting attached to these women?  I just, you know, I just try to turn it off like a faucet. 
[03:43:00]  Right, right, right.  You just, ee-er, ee-er, gotcha.  What's your type of girl?  I like short chicks.  You like short chicks?  I like Italian girls.  Because you're a tall guy.  How tall are you?  I'm only 5'10", but that's...  Oh, okay.  I guess you have a big personality.  Thank you.  You have a commanding presence.  Thank you.  But you like short girls?  Yeah, definitely.  Like little short Jewish girls, Asian girls?  Jewish girls, Italian girls.  Okay.  Not the Asians so much.  No, they're beautiful, too.  Okay.  You're down for whatever at this point. 
[03:43:30]  Black chicks, you know, anybody you know.  What do you think about Nick Cannon?  He was in here earlier.  He's fucking Mariah Carey.  He's the luckiest man on this planet Earth, buddy.  And you know what?  He's got kids with her.  You know what that means?  No condom.  Whoa.  He busted in her.  How long was she married to Tom?  Tom, Tom, a while, right?  Yeah, a little while when she was younger, but now Nick Cannon is tapping that.  What do you think of that?  Would you fuck Mariah Carey?  I would, I would sell my dick to the devil to have her.  You would.  As long as the devil doesn't get to use it, right?  You just don't want control over the dick. 
[03:44:00]  He's a trickster, though, Sam, because you know what?  He'll probably, like, renege on the deal.  You're right.  You're right.  That devil.  Martin in Vegas.  Martin.  You got a, you got a, you're, it's not Martin.  Is your phone on?  What the hell?  I think you got GPS going or something.  Do I say, I'm such a clown.  Let's take a look.  Oh, yeah.  Is the GPS on?  Sorry.  Where's that directing you to?  Oh, 40, 40 feet away from me, I think.  Don't even worry about it.  I'm sorry.  Let me shut this off.  I'm so, so sorry. 
[03:44:30]  Sean in Philly.  Hey, Sam and Mike.  I was wondering if we could get Mike to do the Diamond Ring commercial again.  Well, you heard about these diamonds, haven't you, Mike?  Yeah.  I was listening to them earlier before I came on.  Yeah.  You're not waiting.  And jump in with me here.  Do your ad-lib and throw some humor in this, because that's your specialty.  Okay, thank you, sir.  You know, waiting for, you're not waiting for the holidays to hate Steven Singer, are you?  No, fuck those holidays.  That whore's going to have to wait a while.  No, why wait?  The longer you wait, Mike, the more you're going to hate Steven Singer. 
[03:45:00]  Nah, let him wait.  You know what?  It's my money.  Fuck him if you don't want to take it right away.  That's a guarantee.  Why not get her, Mike, that great gift right online at IHateStevenSinger.com?  Well, you know what?  Maybe that whore's not worth the gift.  Give her something, you know, give her an ice cream cone and shut her the fuck up.  Well, another thing you could do, Steven has a collection of silver and diamond jewelry.  Did you know that?  Let me see how real that shit is.  I don't trust anybody, because bring me one of those glasses where you look at shit through  a magnifying glass type thing.  I think he's got them in his store. 
[03:45:30]  You can see those.  You can find the perfect gift, starting from $69 and going all the way up to $8,900.  Well, $89, I thought it'd be a little, $69, but how are you going to get for that?  You can get some jewelry, but would you spend $8,900 on a girl?  No.  No, you wouldn't do that?  I would spend $8,900 on myself, buy a nice Rolex.  Oh, okay.  Okay, that's an option.  Everything in between as well.  So, you know, you're thinking $5,000, $2,100.  Yeah, probably around a few hundred dollars a month.  You don't really need, you know.  You don't need to go much more than that, do you? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, because you know what?  We don't want to wind up like MC Hammer, you know?  Exactly.  Steven makes holiday shipping so easy and affordable.  You just go online to IHateStevenSinger.com and check out his silver and diamond collection.  Are you sure that website's still working?  Come on, maybe it's jammed up.  Who the fuck knows if it's still active?  Maybe just grab the money and ran that fucking prick.  You're right.  I don't know if the site's still working.  That's fucking shyster that he is.  You don't know for sure.  You have to get the woman in your life a gift, Mike.  And you want it to be a great gift.  Fuck how much that whore we got made before, you know? 
[03:46:30]  Right.  Great gift.  I'll give her a fucking bologna sandwich, that whore.  That's true.  The more you procrastinate in buying her a holiday present, the guiltier you're going  to feel.  The guiltier you feel, the bigger the present you're going to buy.  I don't feel guilty.  That horse should be sucking a bone all the time.  Who cares?  Guilt doesn't...  Guilt comes at the end of my fucking...  My dickwad in that horse mouth.  I don't care about guilt.  So take this advice.  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com now.  Well, there's no rush.  Fuck.  He can wait a while, you know what I mean?  You don't have to rush him.  He's probably at home fucking counting his money. 
[03:47:00]  He'll give a shit about that fucking income group.  Get your holiday shopping done today.  It don't have to be today.  It could be fucking a year from now.  Who cares?  I'll be fucking closing him down if people own a lot of shit.  Who cares?  Steven always has his fast and free shipping both ways.  And with his 90-day return policy, it's truly risk-free shopping.  I don't believe that bullshit.  90 fucking days.  You're never getting money back.  He's full of shit.  You'll have to go to small claims court.  Get your money back from that fucking greedy prick.  He says that it's guaranteed. 
[03:47:30]  Steven Singer Jewelers, it's the other corner of 8th and Walnut, 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER  or online at IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.com.  I hate him as much as everybody else.  I'm such a fucking idiot.  Thank you very much, Mike.  Thank you, sir.  I think we stole some diamonds today.  Let me go to Nick in Virginia.  Hey, Mike.  Thank you for being the one that they chose to speak to the kids, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Kids are the best because...  Hey, I've got to ask you, man.  That steamy pile of shit that you guys created, is that intentionally fucking horrible? 
[03:48:00]  Or is it supposed to be...  All right, all right.  He's trying to get over on you, Mike.  Tell me.  Go ahead.  You know what?  Let him go back to working at Dairy Queen in his meth lab.  Yeah.  Whatever he is right now.  What do you think he does that's so good?  He probably sells meat out of a truck somewhere in Wisconsin.  What do you think the last time he got laid was?  Oh, God.  Does his century still count?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Mike, tell me about...  What's the web series that you've launched?  Oh, thank you, Sam.  It's called Tubby Man.  Right.  It's about a fat superhero. 
[03:48:30]  My friend Ken Burmish, the creator, with me.  And where can people find it?  Oh, it's on...  You can go to statemetubbyman.com.  And you play the lead role.  Yeah, or BlipTV.  It's on now.  Or go to bullieskeepout.com.  You decided to just keep it off YouTube?  No, we got...  BlipTV's pretty good, Sam.  They got a lot of cool people on that.  All right.  Well, I'll take your word for it.  Now, you're a guy who was bullied a lot growing up, right?  Yeah, unfortunately.  I think everybody was one way or another.  Sure, of course.  Except for the jocks.  The jocks don't get bullied.  I know. 
[03:49:00]  You know, if I looked like George Clooney, I wouldn't be here now either.  I'd probably be, you know...  Exactly.  But I learned earlier, you were a good-looking guy back in the day.  Yeah, I got to bring a picture here the next time I'm here.  I looked, you know, from my high school yearbook, people were like, whoa.  So were you a ladies' man in high school?  No, it sucks, you know, Sam, because I wish I had a time machine to go back in time because  I was super quiet and shy.  So you were just like a...  You were a good-looking guy, but awkward.  Yeah, very much.  Huh.  And now you're like, you're looking at those photos, saying, what the fuck did I have to 
[03:49:30]  be so awkward about?  I know, I'm more outgoing now, but...  And now you're a disaster.  No, but Sam, being a comic and an actor made me more outgoing, you know what I mean?  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  I mean, you're getting on stage, you're engaging with strangers.  It's really a good thing.  I mean, you know, it made me more outgoing because, I mean, like, you know, it helped.  So when did things start to go south?  When did you start gaining weight and stuff like that?  Uh, I always had a weight problem up and down from, like, high school. 
[03:50:00]  I was 155 pounds in high school.  I used to take the weight class, like, you know, gym class.  Sure.  Just the weight.  I could hang from a bar for, like, three minutes.  Jesus.  When I was 18 years old.  Now, pull your arms out of the sockets.  I can't even reach for the bar.  I'll remind you on and out.  You'll just see two severed, bachetti arms hanging off a bar.  You'll be like, I'll be decapitated on the bar.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  And then in my 20s, you know, I exercised.  And then, you know, I drank a lot.  And in my 30s, I got kind of sedentary.  I'm like, started doing comedy. 
[03:50:30]  I'm like, you know, didn't care.  Then, you know, you get a little bit older and, you know, all those.  So is that what happened?  You start drinking and then you start gaining weight.  You don't care about your appearance.  No, all those cheeseburgers catch up to you, buddy.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Because when you're a kid, you can eat as many cheeseburgers as you want.  Oh, yeah, yeah, totally.  And that's what you did.  Now, are you trying to diet?  Yeah, definitely.  It's been almost three weeks now since I had a, I cut bread out in soda.  I learned that on your Instagram.  Soda is the enemy, Sam.  I mean, people are like, oh, have diet soda.  No, it's bull crap. 
[03:51:00]  It is, right?  Same shit, right?  Same stuff.  They try to, you know, like, think about it, Sam, right?  Look at a bottle of soda.  There's a lot of sodium in there.  You know what that means?  You'll be drinking your butter off.  That's why they put so much sodium in there.  Is that right?  They want you to come back.  Think about it, right?  Oh, because it'll make you more thirsty.  Yeah, yeah.  Sodium is salt.  What does salt do but make you thirsty?  Absolutely.  I understand.  There's a high content of salt in a lot of soda now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what's the goal in losing weight?  Is it just to feel healthier?  Is it to find a nice girl?  That's one part, Sam, find a nice girl. 
[03:51:30]  And I also want to be a normal-looking human being, a somewhat normal-looking again.  Okay, I mean, that's a struggle.  That's got to be a struggle.  But now, I've got to imagine, I mean, you're on the Artie Lang show every day, right?  Oh, yeah.  Artie Lang show is a giant radio show.  We're on TV, too.  Right, and it's on DirecTV every night.  I'm super blessed to be here and with you guys and go there.  I love it.  I mean, there's only a few shows.  There's Opie and Anthony.  There's Howard Stern.  There's Artie Lang.  There's not very many radio shows that are that big, especially with the DirecTV element 
[03:52:00]  like you guys have.  Oh, yeah.  You've become famous since then.  I wouldn't say I'm that famous.  I think people start to know me.  More famous, definitely, right?  Yeah.  You say you get recognized on the street?  To me, famous is Adam Sandler.  Well, I mean, that's fucking billions of dollars a movie.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you've got to start somewhere.  Oh, no, no.  But I love it, though, Sam.  People, like, I mean, you know yourself from having fans.  People send you stuff sometimes.  It's great.  What's something people have sent you?  I got, like, jerseys from football teams and baseball teams, but... 
[03:52:30]  Are they the right size?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Because otherwise...  But I get some cool letters from people, too.  Email, like, you know, I'm in recovery.  You and Artie help make me laugh and keep making us laugh.  It's touching.  And to you guys who are sober, that's got to be a great thing to be able to turn around  and help people.  But at the same time, isn't there anybody who wants to offer you a piece of poon for entertaining  them?  There's a woman out there, but I mean, you know, I'm selective, though, Sam.  You are.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not just going to go for any slice of pussy that comes your way? 
[03:53:00]  No, I don't settle.  Good for you.  What about if it's just a hookup?  Yeah, that's good, too.  You don't mind that?  Yeah, you know, everybody looks the same in the dark with a light bulb.  Okay, so you're a little less selective when it comes to that.  So are there any radio groupies that are big fans of the show that are willing to give  you a quick piece of poon in the dark?  I don't know.  There's a lot of psychos on Facebook and Twitter, too, though.  Right.  I actually get hit on Facebook a lot by, like...  You do?  Girls from dirt royal countries.  Hi, what's your name?  I'm like, no, honey.  This is like a scamola. 
[03:53:30]  Smart.  Sam, I'm from New York.  You're from New York.  Right.  Nobody runs a game on us.  No, no, no.  You've got to be street smart.  We totally are.  Right, right, right.  So you're not going to fall for a scam like that.  No, no.  But you do live events ever for the show?  No.  Not really.  Because you'd think...  Well, we're going to the Super Bowl again this year.  Oh, that's awesome.  Here's what you've got to do.  You and Artie are at the Super Bowl, right?  You've got all the fans.  All the fans are going to come to you, so you don't have to trust anybody on Facebook or  Twitter.  Then you see some nice poon out there in the crowd that likes... 
[03:54:00]  Then you hook up with that, right?  Yeah.  Tap that ass.  Am I right?  Absolutely, because we went to New Orleans last year.  Have you ever been there?  No.  It's wild.  It's pretty...  I mean, I like the South, but it's a mixture of people down there.  It's like French and Asian.  Yeah.  It's cool.  Did you get some ass?  Uh, no.  Oh, come on.  I was working all the time.  We were shooting all day and doing stuff.  So you're exhausted by the time you get home.  Yeah.  It just would have been nice if you got some of that, you know, Nala pussy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They show that hits for beads over there.  They do? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So you got to see some titty, at least.  No, we're working.  I'm like...  Oh, my God.  With the work.  Sam, I'm like Charlie Brown when it comes to this kind of stuff.  They're just pulling that football out from under you.  How much work is there to do?  No, but it's fun, though.  I mean, I'm just happy to do stuff.  Yeah, I mean, it's great.  And it's fun stuff, you know.  Plus, hopefully, you'll do enough of this stuff that you get popular enough that the  poon just starts getting thrown at you, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like dating Jim Carrey's leftovers.  Right.  You don't mind that.  No, no, no.  Jay in PA.  Out of the park there, Sammy. 
[03:55:00]  I mean, I'm just curious, has Mikey ever tried, you know, one of those dating sites like,  I don't know, Grindr?  Has he ever tried that?  What about that?  Why don't we get you...  What if we got you on Grindr?  Yeah.  I mean...  Something like that?  Grindr or any of the dating sites.  Did you ever try any online dating?  Uh, I used to, years ago, before I was online, dating was like personal ads.  Those were brutal.  Oh, yeah, you don't want to do that.  Now, they got shit now on your phone.  Like, he's talking about Grindr.  You just put your picture in there, and then you see what dudes are around here, whoever, 
[03:55:30]  that wants to hook up.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, Grindr is a man on man.  Oh, fuck.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what Grindr...  Oh.  I don't know, Mike.  I'm not here to judge.  I should know by the title, Sam Grindr.  Grindr, yeah.  It's a nice dude to grind on.  It's like getting your dick grinded in a...  That's right.  No, but there are, there's, uh, there's, uh, match.com.  You ever try any online dating?  Something, uh, Sam, someone told me there's something called kettle of fish or plenty  of fish.  I don't know what the hell it is.  Something like that.  What about Christian Mingle?  No, uh...  What about J-Date? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, that'll be cool.  Right.  Meet a nice Jewish girl on J-Date.  And what you do is...  They're nice.  I love Jewish girls.  They're awesome.  You put up a YouTube video of you on the Artie Lang show, or you on the Opie and Anthony  show, or you on stage or something, and say, yeah, I'm fucking famous.  I got a cool job.  Don't worry about what my photo looks like, you know?  Something like that.  Or you throw up the, the Tubby Man thing.  Like, yeah, I'm doing shit.  Right?  I'm, I'm, I'm fighting bullies.  Thank you, buddy.  You're a pisser.  This is fun, man.  Thank you.  Um, Josh in Ohio. 
[03:56:30]  Sam, quit trying to sound hip-hop.  You're so sucky, you son of a bitch.  Joey in...  I don't know.  Did I feel hip-hop to you, Mike?  No, he's, he's a butt wipe.  Thank you.  Joey in Cleveland.  Hey, Mike.  Hi, Joe.  Where do you, where, where can I find out?  Where to send you, uh, you and Artie some Christmas presents?  Uh, can you, can you go, are you on Facebook?  Yeah.  Are, are you friends with me on Facebook?  You can definitely inbox me if you are. 
[03:57:00]  All right, so, do a Facebook friend request.  Anybody ever send you, Mike Buschetti, any weird stuff?  Oh, God, yeah.  Like, what kind of stuff?  Well, uh, weird stuff?  Uh, somebody had sent me some, uh, baseball mirabilia.  Hmm.  Like, baseballs that were like...  Mirabilia?  Memorabilia, right?  Oh, I thought, like, mirrors.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Like, that was like, you know, a replica of Babe Ruth's autograph, but I wish I had the  real thing.  Right.  Like, what are you going to do with a stamp of Babe Ruth's autograph? 
[03:57:30]  That's no good.  I know.  I love, are you a big sports fan, Sam?  Um, not a big sports fan.  I keep up, you know, follow, follow the big stories.  Uh, you know, I heard you talking about, you were, you were jumping all over the place  today talking about Richie Incognito.  On one end, you're fighting the bullies, but on the other end, you're saying, it's football,  go be a man.  Well, yeah, you know, people, the thing with that is, like, unfortunately, it's kind of  like a blood sport.  The fans are expecting, you know, like the gladiators, you know what I mean?  You gotta, you know, you gotta give in, you know, that that's what they want. 
[03:58:00]  Well, plus, when you're, when you're, when you're playing a game where the object is  to damage the brain of your opponent, to give your guy a concussion, bullying is probably  the least of our concerns, right?  No, I mean, you gotta worry about your life, are you kidding me?  It's like, and he's a big guy, I'm surprised he, you know, didn't fight back.  Yeah, if somebody's, like, if I was the size of, what's it, Jonathan Martin?  Me too.  And somebody's dropping M-bombs on me, I'm punching someone in the face, and that's the  end of it.  That's the end of it.  But, uh, R.C. in Texas has a dating website for you. 
[03:58:30]  What's up, R.C.?  Huh?  Website for ya.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  He can go to Farmers Only.  Farmers Only.  Well, you can either hook up with a good-looking girl or pull a plow, either one.  There you go.  I don't care, but a farmer's daughter's are cool.  I dated one for a little while, years ago.  Yeah, from Nebraska.  Did you ever roll in the hay, you know what I mean?  That's a make-out session, you would have, but that's as far as it went.  You got a lot of girls in your life that you just made out with, that's about as far as  it goes.  Yeah, I can't seal the deal for some reason. 
[03:59:00]  The girls say you're a good kisser?  Yeah, I had a lot of make-outs that year, we kept coming back for more, but it was good.  Mm-hmm.  But that's as far as it went, making out?  Yeah.  No going down on her?  No.  You'd think, if she wants to see how to use that mouth, right?  Well, she was only, like, she was from the Midwest, and she was, like, kind of a, she  was a farmer's daughter, but she was also a virgin.  Oh, okay, so she didn't want to...  Yeah, the wrong guy.  How old were you?  I was, like, 30...  Oh, jeez.  Hold on.  Sam, I was 34, she was 28. 
[03:59:30]  Okay.  28's a little old to be a virgin and still be playing that bullshit, isn't it?  I know, she grew up in Nebraska, in a farm town.  Jesus.  Snowy.  Oh, sorry, I gotta click the button.  Hey there, man.  Hey, hey, hey, Snowy, what's up, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, you know, Mike, you sound a bit like I already over the radio.  You do have a similar cadence.  Thank you, but I think it's remarkable.  I've been able...  I'll re-heat with him now, but it's possible.  It could rub off.  14 months.  14 months.  I learned that on your Instagram.  Oh, thank you.  Well, Mike Buschetti, you gotta follow him on Instagram. 
[04:00:00]  I told the guys about it today.  You're all about the Instagram videos.  I love it, though, Sam.  It's so much fun, right?  Oh, yeah, it's a blast.  But you love...  You don't like the photos.  You like the videos.  Yeah, much better.  And you just, like, getting on there, saying your shit, whatever you gotta plug,  whatever you gotta promote, you're there.  I love it.  People rag about it, but I don't care.  You know, who cares?  So it's Mike Buschetti on Twitter, Mike Buschetti on Instagram, Mike Buschetti on Facebook.  You performing anywhere in the near future?  I'm actually gonna be November 22nd at a place called Union Hall in Brooklyn.  All right.
