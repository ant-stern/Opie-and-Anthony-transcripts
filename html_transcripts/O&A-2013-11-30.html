<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment featuring Andrew Dice Clay. The hosts ribbed Clay about his physique, prompting a discussion of his workout regimen (cardio after weights, a personal trainer).  This segued into sexually explicit conversation, with Clay making numerous vulgar comments about women and sex.  The conversation shifted to Clay's resurgence following a role in a Woody Allen film, the positive critical response, and comparisons to other actors’ career revivals. He discussed his podcast, "Rolling with Dice and Wheels," featuring guests like Alonzo Bowden and Tom Green,  his upcoming book, "The Filthy Truth," co-authored with David Ritz, and a new talent show he's co-producing.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of the hosts' own increased media attention due to the Woody Allen movie. One host mentioned feeling overwhelmed by press, and his son’s advice to “own it.” This led to a humorous review of past Opie and Anthony segments, including their comedic dissection of Barry Williams’ Branson show and Yakov Smirnoff’s "Yakov's Dinner Adventure," referencing amusing YouTube compilations highlighting the disparity between advertised quality and reality. They also discussed a poorly received Joe Piscopo Showtime special and a racially insensitive Happy Days episode, along with a Dudley Moore episode dealing with dark themes.  The segment included commercial breaks for Smoke Remedy, Bare Minerals Foundation, debt relief services, Jim Norton's "Jim Norton Obsessed" radio show, and the Stand Up for Heroes event.  Patton Oswalt called in, expressing his fondness for the show and promoting his appearances on Adult Swim’s "The Heart She Holler" and Moby Dick readings. The hosts discussed their early careers, financial struggles, and personal anecdotes, including Jim Norton's mold-infested apartment.

The show continued with more advertisements, including a digital filing system, language learning software, Dish Network’s Hopper DVR, MagicJack, and Kios DS for heartburn. A caller, "dad,"  used highly vulgar language while discussing the challenges of parenting teenage daughters. Another caller detailed his firing from SiriusXM, the insulting contract offer ($100/week for a podcast), and anecdotes from his honeymoon, including a stolen car and marijuana use.

Colin Quinn then appeared in studio.  The hosts and Quinn discussed his new show based on the Constitution, his experiences at the Barrow Street Theater, his views on political correctness and free speech, his feud with a comedian called "Voice," the Irish Travellers, and negative encounters with other comedians. Chris Hardwick called in, discussing "The Nerdist," his podcast and TV show, his love for Doctor Who, and his chess playing. More advertisements followed.

A later segment featured Chris Hardwick in more detail, discussing his childhood chess prowess, his BBC show based on "The Nerdist," and his career as a comedian.  The conversation included sexually suggestive comments from the hosts,  Hardwick’s admiration for chess grandmasters, and his experiences with television appearances.  A heated discussion ensued regarding a payment dispute between Hardwick and his co-host Rich Vos for a pilot, with both expressing frustration and using offensive language. They also discussed the differences between East Coast and West Coast comedy scenes, mentioning various comedians from Boston and New York, before a final shout-out to Nate Bargatze.

The show concluded with a segment featuring Bonnie McFarlane, discussing her all-female comedy festival, "All Jane No Dick," and the complexities of the debate surrounding women in comedy.  Rich Vos joined, sharing his views and expressing shared frustrations with TV shows like *Homeland* and *Boardwalk Empire*.  The segment also included promotional announcements for "Weird Medicine with Dr. Steve," "The Paul Feinbaum Show," and LD Products.

A very chippersin Thanksgiving continues on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Hi, this is Krebschickl.  And I'm going to be participating in the Thanksgiving festivities.  I like stuffing with raisins.  That's my favorite food, stuffing with extra raisins. 
[00:07:00]  In this segment, Andrew Dice Clay, who uses a lot of language that I don't really care for,  returns to the show to discuss.  He was in a Woody Allen picture.  I like Stardust Memories.  That's my favorite.  But this is called Jasmine.  I guess he talks about working out and things of that nature.  I didn't really care for this segment because of the language.  I think you could be very funny if you don't curse, too. 
[00:07:30]  Shickle about it.  Hey, D.C.  What up, yo?  Take a seat.  Dice.  You look fucking fantastic.  I got to tell you.  You're standing out there.  You're trim, slim, svelte dice.  In the cage, my friend.  You're in the cage.  Me and Norton.  I couldn't believe when I saw Norton in Vegas.  Can you believe it?  You know, the shape he's in.  Yeah.  And I heard, through the grapevine, that you've been in the cage.  Yeah.  Going to the gym, doing the right thing. 
[00:08:00]  Going to the gym?  No.  Going to the gym and eating better.  Is it a lie?  No.  No, I'm going today.  It's English, but it's not a lie.  He has been going to the gym and working out like a maniac.  Yeah.  I go constantly.  And what do you do?  What do you do, Dice?  What do you do to work out?  Weights?  You do cardio?  I do everything.  I do the cardio.  I normally start with the cardio.  Yeah.  And any trainer that tells you to end with cardio is an asshole human being.  Really?  Yeah.  Because that's the trick.  It's a trick, Anthony. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because when you do cardio last, let's say you hire a trainer.  I do.  All right, stay on this for 40 minutes.  I got to go.  Ah.  And they leave.  Cardio is the most important.  After that, everything else is extra.  Gravy.  You know what I mean?  Using the weights, all that stuff.  That's like the cherry on top.  That's like building up, you know.  Yeah, when a trainer comes over, hey, you want me to train you?  You know, let me work you out.  Oh, yeah?  I'll work you out.  How does that sound?  I got the trainer.  You got the trainer?  Yeah, he comes over the house.  I got a whole room. 
[00:09:00]  I used to have a trainer.  Because I wouldn't go.  Well, you see, but I am self-motivated that way.  See, I'm not.  Like, I like being in the gym.  I don't.  You know?  I like being in the room next to my bedroom.  Well, then don't.  That's what I do.  Don't do it.  But that's what I do.  You know, you've always been a lean guy.  You don't need the trainer.  Get on the trainer.  You could have a treadmill in your house.  But I do.  He does.  I do.  And you won't get on it.  Make my mic louder.  Make my mic louder.  Make my mic louder.  You got to turn your headphones up, maybe, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  You know how to work the electronicals. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Do me a trailer.  No, no.  I got the trainer.  He comes over.  Okay.  He comes over.  And we do weights and shit.  And I do the treadmill on the days he's not there.  I don't need him watching me on a fucking treadmill.  But that's what I'm saying.  That's why I don't like these trainers that go,  Oh, you need to be on the treadmill last year.  Right, right.  Oh, you?  Yeah, yeah.  For you?  No.  Because you told me.  No, he's going to work from the time he gets there  until the time he leaves.  That's it.  So he comes to your house?  You don't go to a gym?  No, he comes to the house.  It's great.  You got a whole setup like that?  That's the whole setup. 
[00:10:00]  Weights, the whole fucking deal.  And I do that, work out for...  No, but when you say weights, the whole fucking deal.  Like, what comes after the weights?  What do you mean?  What's the whole fucking deal?  Oh, and a machine.  You know, a machine where you could fucking, you know,  you're pulling, you're pushing, you're fucking lifting.  That's how I look at chicks.  Yeah, yeah, you're pulling, you're pushing.  You know what I mean?  When they do that little frog bounce.  Yeah.  You know, when they climb on top,  they put their hands at your sides,  they stop bouncing that fucking fat ass,  twerking it on your dick.  You got to watch, though.  You know what I mean? 
[00:10:30]  Sometimes they lean.  It's the workout.  But sometimes they lean in a direction where it's like,  do you know how this cock works?  It's not hinged like a ball joint at the bottom.  Well, you know why?  I put them through,  I put them through a little boot camp session first  just to train them what I need.  A little training what you need.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  They want to hop on and then lean back.  It's like my fucking,  it's called a hard on,  not a fucking soft on.  No, but you can work that angle.  You can work that angle.  You can, but they got to do it slow, Dice.  You lean back slow, you don't fucking...  Well, you get a novice. 
[00:11:00]  You get what you deserve.  Go back, well...  You know what I mean?  All right.  I like getting them a little broken in.  I don't mind if a chick's been fucking for a few years.  You don't mind them a little sloppy?  No, I like a girl that knows what she's doing  because a lot of...  A gem mint seven.  No, but seriously.  When you go with a lot of these girls, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  And they give you the,  I'm a nice girl,  I don't really do these kind of things,  like girly and relate.  It's like, you know what?  Then you're not for me.  Okay.  You know, I like a girl that could just sort of hop on  and join the team. 
[00:11:30]  Doesn't need any instruction.  Join my team of fucking bulls.  The manual's been lost for years.  You like all this twerking stuff?  Fucking, they took a stripper's move  and gave it a name.  Right.  Yes, thank you.  You're right.  You know, my wife's been doing that for me  since the day I met.  I walk in the house,  she's twerking over there.  Twerking.  You know what I mean?  I go, they stole your move.  It's become very, uh, uh,  like an African-American move or something.  I just fucking love any chick that has the nerve  to go in a public place to a club 
[00:12:00]  and say, basically, this is what I could do  on your fucking cock.  And I'm going, you filthy animal.  I want to marry you.  That is what they're doing,  is like, look what I could do  if your cock was right here and I was on it.  Yeah, I mean, think of that.  How they start moving each cheek individually  like they're showing you.  I say, you think that's something.  Watch my balls.  One's doing the song,  but the other one's doing the meringue.  Do you twerk with your nuts?  You know what I mean?  I twerk with my fucking nuts.  You twerk with your nutsack. 
[00:12:30]  I just don't, uh,  I don't think they get into bed, though,  and do those things.  I think it's a thing they do,  and then they get into bed  and just fucking lay there anyway.  Exactly.  Lay there like fucking...  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it's like, how about...  Lay there like a dead fucking fish.  How about your work?  There you go.  Fucking sister.  There you go.  There's some twerking.  Oh my God, look at that big ass.  That's a nice, big, fucking fat ass.  And she's doing it in like a bakery.  No, she's in a grocery.  There we go. 
[00:13:00]  Pick up the...  You got another one?  There we go.  Now she's by the milk aisle.  Yeah, she should be very proud  of her accomplishment.  She's very...  Her ass really moves in a wonderful way.  Yeah, it really is,  and it's a big, fat dumper.  It just reminds me of some  animalistic mating ritual.  Well, we are animals.  Yeah, but I don't know.  We're fucking...  We're sands.  Yeah, we're animals.  If I was with her,  my dick would whistle at her.  Yeah?  Yeah.  My dick makes noise sometimes.  That would feel good.  But I'll tell you,  that big fucking juicy ass  hitting against your stomach  in pubis  would just milk your dick.  Pubis?  Yeah, like the little area 
[00:13:30]  above your dick.  It's called a...  The hair?  It's a pubis.  No, the pubic hair  is the pubic hair,  but the pubis  is the area  right along  above the penis.  You know what?  I'm not that...  I didn't want to go to school  to learn.  Yeah, it's a pubis.  You know what I mean?  Norton knows all this shit,  but she is great.  She would milk your penis  really nicely.  Oh my God,  look at this.  She's not even trying.  She's just jumping up and down  and her ass is really  like fucking shaking.  I wouldn't say  I'm attracted to her at all,  but she would make you  cum really good. 
[00:14:00]  You're not attracted to that?  No.  A beefy chick like that?  No, I don't like her face  that much.  I don't like that.  Who's even looking at that?  But the ass would make you cum.  If you're looking at her face,  she's not doing a job.  I don't like that ass.  But why not pick the dress up  and show us the face?  See, there goes one cheek.  Here we go.  I'll tell you, Ant,  it would make you cum.  You wouldn't believe...  You'd probably go,  holy mackerel,  I'm cumming already.  You wouldn't believe  how fucking well you came  with that girl.  Really?  That really is a good one.  I don't know.  It's too big.  Twerk you mother.  I don't like that. 
[00:14:30]  I like a fat ass.  I'm not a big fat ass, Ant.  Well, I like a beefy ass.  I'll put it to you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I do too.  But that's too much.  We got a lot to talk about today.  I got a lot going on.  We're talking about  fucking twerking slobs,  banging balls to the face.  You know, when you come in,  we usually talk about  just shoving dicks in chicks.  Okay, I know, I know.  But you do have a lot going on.  So you're like running the show today.  You're, you know...  I'll be on a jury duty.  He's on jury duty.  Yeah, yeah.  He just left for jury duty.  Yeah, he went over there for...  Somebody else that'll get off.  Yeah.  Everybody gets off. 
[00:15:00]  I don't even know  why they have courtrooms anymore.  All right, well,  let's draw this out  for a few weeks  and you can leave.  You think that's it?  Yeah, fucking justice.  There is no justice.  I don't think you agreed  with the Trayvon Zimmerman trial.  No, I'm talking about  that kid that stole  the socks from Macy's.  You know what I mean?  They put him in court.  Oh, that big trial.  Yeah, theft, you know.  Yeah.  I'm like,  you gotta be able to steal  in this day and age.  Things are too expensive.  Well, that's true.  I don't think socks...  You know, people get guilty  over stealing. 
[00:15:30]  Socks ain't bad.  And stealing like that...  No, but he took like  thousands of them.  Oh.  Yeah, off a truck.  And I'm like,  it's socks.  You need them.  Yeah, who gives a shit?  Yeah.  I don't care.  Yeah.  So you do have a lot  going on, Dice.  A fucking Woody Allen movie.  Yeah, tonight's the premiere.  I'm very excited about it.  Big premiere.  Very exciting.  And I'd be.  That is huge.  Yeah.  How was it working  with Woody?  Woody's the greatest.  Is he great?  He was great.  He let me do  what I'm supposed to do. 
[00:16:00]  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  And, you know,  from what I'm reading,  it's almost like embarrassing.  What do you mean?  Well, you know what?  I really showed up  to do a great job  because I knew  the kind of actors  I was going to work with.  It's huge.  You know what I mean?  You're working with Alec  and Cate Blanchett  and, you know,  these are the, you know,  Sally Hawkins,  Golden Globe winners.  Uh-huh.  So I was like,  I really got to bring an A game  and I didn't do a movie  in 12 years.  Jesus.  You know, but, you know,  when I see these, like,  you know, 
[00:16:30]  the Wall Street Journal,  you know,  the way to write me up  and, you know,  I'm like,  this is the craziest thing  I've ever been involved in.  You know what I'm seeing here, Dice?  And I'm not kidding around either.  No, I know what you're talking about.  This could be  the fucking John Travolta  Pulp Fiction thing for you.  But that's what they're saying.  They're talking about  Mickey Rourke and the wrestler.  Uh-huh.  But I'm like,  these guys,  I mean, guys like Mickey Rourke  to me are the best.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know,  to me he's one of the greatest actors  just ever.  No shit, yeah.  You know, so I understood that 
[00:17:00]  and he's the star of that movie.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And even though Travolta,  you know,  was a supporting role  in Pulp Fiction,  it was still a giant part.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  And so I get,  but you know,  this is really,  it set me back a little.  I'm pretty like overwhelmed.  A little humbled?  I'm very humbled.  Yeah?  Yeah, I mean,  I'm talking to you now  just straight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I feel like,  I really hope I did as good a job  as what he's been saying  and that's all I wanted to do.  What's the character? 
[00:17:30]  Well, you know,  he's a very regular guy.  You know what I mean?  He's a guy that's gone  through a lot of stuff,  which I can relate to.  You know,  but, you know,  I had to go pretty deep.  You know,  it's like I got my own  method of acting.  I know how to get there.  But, you know,  I just can't believe  the press on this.  Yeah, yeah.  You know,  I mean,  the AP came out,  Associated Press,  the other night  to take pictures  when I was in Vegas  at Vinyl,  which I've done  the AP before.  Yeah, sure.  And they never send 
[00:18:00]  anybody to take pictures.  And the guy said,  honestly, Dice,  this is the biggest story  in showbiz right now.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm like,  you're kidding me.  You know,  because I'm playing Vinyl.  I'm at the Hard Rock  in Vegas.  Mm-hmm.  And I'm like,  this is all going on  around me.  I, like,  don't even get it.  You know?  And big premiere tonight.  Yeah, I haven't felt this,  honestly,  since 88,  since the Rodney special.  See,  when the Rodney special aired,  I knew what had happened.  You know,  that I would even talk 
[00:18:30]  to Dennis back then  when he,  you know,  when I was doing,  like,  Rascals,  28 shows in a row.  And he was looking  to put me,  like,  in 500 seat rooms.  And I'm like,  it's bigger than that.  And I think,  the only way to prove it  was to have him put me  on sale  somewhere else  in the country  because he felt  it was territorial.  And he put me in Phoenix  at the theater,  Celebrity Theater,  one show,  but they sold three  in one day.  Oh, man.  And that's when he realized  this isn't normal. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know,  and I haven't had that feeling.  I feel very,  like,  like,  elevated.  Yeah, yeah.  My whole mind,  my whole mood  about this whole thing.  It's time.  I mean,  and,  like,  you know,  people have been asking me,  like,  what,  if you had to pick,  like,  three things  in your career  that really  would mark you,  I said,  well,  the Rodney special  because that just  blew me through the roof.  Oh, hell yeah.  Then when I was doing  the arenas,  you know,  led to Madison Square Garden.  Yeah.  And now this Woody movie  because it's the shot  of a lifetime. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, shit.  But I didn't know  when I was doing it.  I just really wanted  to do a great job for him.  How did you read for him?  Because if Woody  doesn't like a performance,  he'll throw it out  and just cast somebody else  and reshoot it.  Yeah,  he did that to Kramer.  Well,  you know,  but that's what he does.  That's why his movie,  like,  he'll go,  the guy's not getting it.  Get rid of him  and get me the right actor.  Yeah.  You know,  so when I'm on that set,  it's like,  just do a great job for you.  These pretzels  are making me thirsty.  Something like that.  You deliver the line like that.  Oh,  but that's not,  that's not what I'm doing. 
[00:20:00]  I know.  How did you read for him?  You meet with him  and then he just hands you a script?  I hear he wants to talk to you first, right?  I went in there  and it was very loose  and he was with the casting lady  and the producer  and he was very cool,  very laid back  and,  you know,  we're doing a film  and would you read a few pages?  You know,  and I'm like,  can you give me something to go on?  You know,  and he goes,  well,  you know,  he's,  just take a look.  You know,  and I went in another room  with the casting. 
[00:20:30]  I went through two pages.  I said,  I got this.  Let's go in.  But she was like,  are you sure?  Because I only went through it the one time  but I could see what it was.  So I do it for him  and I go,  look,  I don't even know if the guy's from the East Coast,  you know,  I don't know anything.  If you want,  I'll do it again.  And he goes,  well,  you have the essence.  It was perfect.  And I was like,  all right,  you know,  I guess I'll see you on the set.  You know,  but when I,  when I actually got the text that,  I didn't even open it for my manager, 
[00:21:00]  Bruce,  you know,  and I just saw you got the,  you know,  it was an emotional thing for me.  Wow.  You know,  because,  you know,  number one,  it's like something my parents would have always wanted to see me do.  Anytime I would do a movie,  I mean,  my mother loved that I was the comic I am.  But like,  if I get a movie,  she'd go,  is it,  is it a drama?  She loved dramatic.  She knew I could do the drama.  Yeah.  And I go,  well,  mom,  I'm a comic.  It's,  it's like a comedy,  you know,  but this is like something they would have just loved.  I mean, 
[00:21:30]  you know,  I could just see them talking about it.  I've seen you act and act like,  you know,  where you wouldn't even know.  But it wasn't for you.  You're talking about like crime story years ago.  But even that was more animated.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  this isn't as animated,  but I saw,  no,  even like early,  way early on,  like in fucking mash when you were in mash.  I remember that.  It was like fucking holy shit.  That was their last Halloween episode.  Was it?  Yeah.  You know,  that was the,  that was the last year they were on.  I was like,  I couldn't believe I got that back then. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  That was the beginning.  It was one of the first parts I ever got.  Yeah.  You know,  and then the whole dice thing went crazy like eight years later,  you know,  you know,  it's been a very interesting career.  No shit.  You know,  I know,  you know,  you've been part of a big part of it.  You know,  you've been part of a bit.  Everybody here has been.  Yeah.  He has happened.  Oh no.  I don't know this fucking guy and I don't trust him.  Good.  You know what I mean?  You know,  any guy that looks at me like that,  I don't trust.  But anyway,  no,  I'm just fucking with you. 
[00:22:30]  You know that,  right?  Travis is a good guy.  Yeah.  How do you know?  I live with him.  He's come over the house.  His wife is lovely.  Live with him for a week.  You live with it.  No,  no.  Live with him.  Fuck that.  Exactly.  So how great is he really?  Good point.  Yeah,  exactly.  We live together.  It's nice to be in here with you.  during the hurricane,  he did live at my house,  him and his family.  Well,  wasn't that nice of him?  Wasn't that nice of him?  His power was out in his car.  Because he was riding a U-boat around his house.  He moved there with you.  It was.  Did you a favor?  He was down in,  where are you down there? 
[00:23:00]  Rockaway.  Rockaway,  yeah.  Oh wow,  that really got it.  Is everything all right now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For us,  yeah.  Crazy with the fucking night.  Oh,  it's crazy.  In Vegas now,  you know,  last time I was in Vegas,  118 degrees.  300 degrees,  yeah.  118 in the dark.  In the dark.  In the fucking nighttime dark.  But you don't,  the thing is,  you don't have to go outside.  I absorbed it.  Did you absorb it?  Yeah,  I don't care.  It doesn't bother me.  You fucking probably turned it into pure energy.  You're like a,  you're like a solar panel.  You soak it in and turn it into energy.  Well,  you know why?  I just take it. 
[00:23:30]  It's like people,  it's so,  yeah,  well,  just adapt.  That's what it is.  It's almost at the point where I felt like weathermen,  you know,  like when it used to hit like 90 degrees,  like it would be like,  if you don't have to go out,  don't go out,  you know,  even here,  you know?  Yeah.  But there,  they go 118,  18.  I'm waiting for a guy,  like the weather guy to come on like in a tank top and shorts going,  you wouldn't fucking believe this shit.  135.  Just stay the fucking,  do yourselves a favor.  Find some broad,  bury your balls in a fucking grease pit and have a good night. 
[00:24:00]  Grease pit.  Why would he say that?  He might say,  stay the fuck in,  but why would he tell you to fuck a girl?  Because we're not sure you to do when you're in the house.  You either whack your own baggie,  you have somebody whack it for you.  He wants to read it.  Like the other day,  I'm rinsing my cock off in this chick's asshole.  Yeah,  sure.  Rinsing it off in her asshole.  No,  come on.  We're just fucking around doing it.  Of course we are.  How's your podcast?  Your podcast is all the way up there.  Yeah,  here on the,  the Opium Anthony podcast.  It comes out on Wednesdays.  Yeah, 
[00:24:30]  because I do the,  uh,  rolling with dice and wheels.  Yes.  Yes.  You know,  which is,  which is doing phenomenal.  You know,  we don't have a,  you know,  what do you do?  You take part of the show and put it on.  We just take part of the show and put it on.  It's,  it's for people that usually probably can't get this show.  Uh huh.  Yeah.  Because of something,  you know,  it's a great idea.  And then they could get some of us on there.  Yeah,  it does very well.  The rolling with dice and wheels is just,  it's like a freak thing.  I like talking about it because number one,  Joe Rogan,  like really like pushed me to do my own podcast. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah,  he's got wheels.  Wheels is hysterical.  He started doing his own podcast to get me to do a podcast.  Oh,  is that how he got you?  Oh yeah.  That's how he scams me into every fucking thing.  Right.  You know,  why are you doing a podcast?  Well,  I just like doing it,  you know,  and then he gets me to do rolling with dice and wheels,  but Rogan was right.  And,  uh,  you know,  we're only on like two and a half months,  but we got over 200,000 followers.  Wow.  Shit.  You know,  uh,  we were told by iTunes,  we'll probably hit over a million by like October.  I mean,  it's,  it's a real freak. 
[00:25:30]  What kind of show?  What do you,  well,  we roll,  we go anywhere.  We've broken into,  uh,  we,  we broke into a foreclosed home a few weeks ago and barbecued,  you know,  cause I don't like being stuck like in a studio.  Oh,  I couldn't do this all day.  Yeah.  Believe me,  be inside.  Like,  like our first one was in the desert.  Yeah.  You know,  like a half hour outside of Vegas,  you know,  like just like,  and he was like,  bodies.  Yeah.  He's going,  why do we got to be here?  I go,  cause I don't need to be inside. 
[00:26:00]  You know,  wheels is funny.  Cause he's like,  we're inside.  We're 80 miles outside of town,  you know,  but,  but we roll,  we go to bars,  we go anywhere.  Hence the role.  You know,  I'll do the show anyway,  as long as I'm not inside.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And you know,  we talk about anything,  you know,  there's a,  you know,  there's a lot of problems on the show,  but you know,  people,  well,  you know,  people,  they like everything going on,  but you never know what's going on.  It's almost like what I would call like the first reality podcast show. 
[00:26:30]  It's almost like a TV show.  Only you don't see the TV.  Okay.  All right.  Now I'm kind of getting the drift.  We just live it.  You know what I mean?  Like whatever hat,  there's no format.  There's no structure.  You know,  I really don't know what I'm doing.  You know,  you know,  I just wing it and,  uh,  you know,  and now and then we have a guest.  Yeah.  Did you do it,  Norton?  I've never been invited.  Oh man.  I would love you to do it,  but I didn't want to,  he was in Vegas for a day.  I'm not going to break his balls through my podcast. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  Cause I don't even give a fuck if we have a guest.  I,  I actually hate when we have guests because then you got to like ask questions.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  about somebody,  you know,  well him,  I love,  but you know,  if you have somebody else on,  like,  I want to say,  I don't even give a fuck about you.  Who you had on.  So,  uh,  well,  who last comic we had on was,  uh,  Oh,  can I say a funny thing?  Bowden?  Hmm.  You know,  Alonzo Bowden.  Kenny might know.  Oh,  okay.  Alonzo Bowden. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Kenny.  Yeah.  Yes.  Kenny.  He was a great guest.  He's,  he's like the only comic we had on the show.  Kenny would like to add something here.  Kenny,  feel free.  I didn't even see you come in.  Andrew does this funny thing.  He goes,  he goes to wheels.  We'll be right back.  And Wells goes,  what are you talking about?  We're doing a podcast.  We're not good.  He goes,  but that's what radio guys say.  Yeah,  exactly.  You just say,  we'll be right back.  Yeah.  But then you don't go anywhere.  Well,  that's what he said.  He said like,  because like guys like you,  you'll always go.  We'll be right back. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And you know,  so wheels like says like,  no,  but we're not going anywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  so we're not back.  We,  we still here.  Well,  that'll probably come in handy.  If you do get some sponsors and then they cut the show up and play it again,  they could put the commercials right there where you said that.  Yeah.  But I didn't even understand that part.  Cause like all wheels does is take money from me to buy shit.  Uh huh.  Oh,  you know,  and I'll see like three new wires.  I'll go,  I gave you $1,700.  Three new wires.  And he goes,  yeah,  but I get the wires. 
[00:28:30]  Look at Mike,  we got good headphones.  I'll see.  He knows you don't know the,  the electronicals.  I don't even have time to like think about it.  You know what I mean?  It's like,  I just want it to go good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Watch.  We'll be right back.  I say that.  Yeah.  That was smooth.  But then you're still there.  Yeah.  Well,  you know,  it's rolling with dice and wheels.  Yeah.  I never claimed to be the brightest.  No,  no.  You know what I mean?  No,  but I do like,  I do like the whole sound of it.  It sounds very cool.  If you want,  I'll show you some t-shirts. 
[00:29:00]  Oh,  that is nice.  You know what I mean?  It's got pictures of you and wheels.  We do the fucking.  You got,  you fucking always got something going on.  Rolling with dice and wheels.  Dice has always got something going on.  They can get it on iTunes.  People should go to iTunes.  Go to iTunes.  Because you got a big podcast.  You're like number one,  number two,  whatever.  Yeah.  Well,  you know,  it fluctuates.  We cheat,  but you're always,  we got radio shows.  No,  but that's what I'm saying.  So I should say it on your show.  Yes.  So like the people.  Good idea.  That listen to Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah.  Subscribe to Dice's podcast. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  You just go on iTunes.  It's on a stitcher.  It's on SoundCloud,  but yeah,  uh,  we're pretty high up there.  Like in,  you know,  you know,  it's just right.  I was just saying how enjoyable it is to hear him talk about electronic stuff.  Electronics.  but wheels teaches me about this.  Yeah.  Like,  I don't really know what it means.  Uh huh.  You know what I mean?  But he goes,  no,  you got to understand.  We got,  he goes on SoundCloud alone.  We got over 200,000 followers.  Like it is like a freak thing.  Like it's really escalating quickly.  I think I'm believing that Dice does know what he's talking about. 
[00:30:00]  No,  I don't know about electronics.  I'd be willing to think Dice.  You think he does?  He knows a little more than he's putting on.  I got Samsung 3D,  my friend.  3D fucking D.  You like,  you like the Samsung phone?  Uh,  yeah.  The fam.  Huh?  Oh,  look at that.  What a handsome family.  Yeah.  Very,  that beautiful wife.  He's got the beautiful kids.  Where's the wife over here?  Dice living the fucking,  yeah,  living the life over here.  Oh yeah.  She's really,  really attractive. 
[00:30:30]  All due respect,  but oh yeah.  She's really lovely.  She's a very pretty girl.  Yeah.  Stop with the lovely.  She's a lovely.  No,  but I know what you mean when you say that.  Very well built.  I know what you mean.  Very well built,  lovely gal.  She really is.  I mean,  you know,  initially I was attracted to her.  That's how you start going out.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  But I'm,  I'm still,  I mean,  it's,  she's amazing.  Yeah.  I mean,  she's an amazing person.  You know,  since the day I met her,  she was always calling me my movie star boyfriend and my,  but I would actually tell her,  I go,  you know what?  I'm not looking to build that career. 
[00:31:00]  Uh huh.  You know,  I think that time has come and gone.  I really would tell her that.  I go,  I just want to rebuild the comedy,  do some bigger places,  do the theaters again,  whatever.  The second you have a plan.  And actually,  you know,  you know,  me and Norton have the same agent,  you know,  with,  with Pete Papalotto.  And we were supposed to go on sale for the garden again,  as crazy as it sounds,  but it's built to that with,  with all this present,  but I'm not prepared for it.  You know,  when I come off a stage at vinyl,  you're talking about a 400 seat room, 
[00:31:30]  whatever it is.  I'm burnt.  Yeah.  You know,  so I started about four months ago when I knew this garden thing was coming and started like training my lower body because,  you know,  years ago I would do a lot of that because I was doing the arenas and you know how the lights, Norton, they zap you in 20 minutes.  You know what I mean?  So if you're in a big place like that,  you know,  and if I go and do that,  if it's called for,  if I do this one more fucking time,  you know,  I did it with you guys.  I've done that place. 
[00:32:00]  I've done three shows there,  been there twice.  How many fucking,  what do I got to prove,  Joey?  What do I got to prove?  You got nothing to prove.  But people are writing in like that.  I shouldn't have,  you know,  like canceled out to do it.  And I'm like,  I got to give them the kind of show that they deserve.  You know what I mean?  I really want to go balls out and you've got to build it.  Build your lower body or else after 20 minutes,  I'm going to be fucking zap.  You're going to be fucking.  So I didn't want to,  so I'm doing,  I'm doing the regular gig.  You know,  you know what?  Through going what I would call through the lean times, 
[00:32:30]  the last like 12 years,  whatever,  you know,  playing these clubs again,  because it was so crazy when I would do those giant places that once I got  like into the zone of doing like the governor's,  you know,  clubs,  I mean,  there really isn't anything better more,  you know,  of course the money is bigger when you play big places,  but it's not all about money.  You know,  it's also about satisfaction of knowing you came off the stage and really just  killed that crowd.  You know what I mean? 
[00:33:00]  And there is nothing better than a comedy club.  I mean,  that night I went down to the,  uh,  to the cellar with you.  I went on after Norton.  We both killed that,  but it's so satisfying as a comic.  Yeah.  Well,  that's what I mean initially started doing it.  You know,  but if it's qualified,  I would do,  I don't want to do arena.  I don't want the same career I had,  you know,  now I'm getting ready to do this,  uh,  thing.  Uh,  it's a new talent show.  It's called the big,  big show that I'm,  uh,  co-producing with this guy,  Tommy Habib,  who has the show cheaters on. 
[00:33:30]  Uh,  it's a talent show.  It's like an updated version of the gong show.  And I was signed on as the head judge and Tom green.  And there's a girl we can't mention yet.  Only cause she's not completely signed and we'll shoot one this summer.  And then we're moving it to Vegas to do the whole season.  And you know,  it's,  it's going to be hysterical.  I mean,  you know,  Tom green is hysterical.  Yeah.  You know,  he's on the podcast a lot.  Yeah.  He'll call me from his podcast and go,  I want to do your podcast.  It's like people like,  remember when they used to have beepers? 
[00:34:00]  I'll beep you.  You beat me back over here.  I hear me now.  You know what I mean?  But,  but I'm saying,  you know,  everybody,  I'll do your podcast.  You do my podcast.  Yeah.  Everybody's doing my podcast.  Why would I do wrong with dice?  If you're not going to roll over here.  It's like when the Flintstones would be on the,  but I just saw Adam Carolla.  I've done his show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  which he does at his restaurant in LA,  which is a great show.  Live audience.  Yeah.  We just had,  it's like doing a standup shot.  His restaurant.  I dive in his studio. 
[00:34:30]  He has a restaurant.  He bought this fucking joint.  Yeah.  And everybody's drinking like Mangria.  Yeah.  The Mangria.  The Mangria.  And you're just on stage getting drunk and killing the crowd.  Christ.  Yeah.  I love it.  Oh,  I love drinking now.  Oh yeah.  Do you really?  Oh,  you got back in.  Well,  no,  I was never in it to start with my whole life.  I've seen dice drink.  No,  Tom Green got me into drinking and I thank him for that.  Oh no.  You know,  because my whole life I was very straight. 
[00:35:00]  I thank him for that.  No,  no.  Well,  because I got to give somebody the,  you know,  the,  the PQs.  Sure.  You know,  the,  what is that called?  Kudos.  Yeah.  What does that even mean?  Kudos.  Like thank yous.  Yeah.  It's silly.  Recognition.  It's the dumbest fucking word I ever heard.  Yeah.  But I thank him for that because,  you know,  when we do the podcast,  I could drink.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  What do you,  what's your poison?  Well,  you know,  my wife normally just gets me some concoction.  Yeah.  Like a lot of rum.  And then I give her the concoction. 
[00:35:30]  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  You know what I mean?  So,  so when he started,  when I started hanging with him,  you know,  he got me quickly,  like into like,  you know,  first beer,  you know,  he's got the Tom Green beer out now. 
[00:36:00]  He's got his own beer because he drinks so much.  He's so good at it.  Are you a happy drunk or do you get a little belligerent?  I have a fucking great time.  Are you good?  You're fun to be around.  But I figure,  you know,  I'm in my fifties.  When am I going to start having fun?  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  What are you going to do?  What's better than having a couple of drinks,  going to the gym,  pumping iron?  You don't even realize you're fucking doing it.  You're just having a great time laughing.  Sounds like a good way to get injured.  You know what I mean?  No,  but use the machines when you drink.  You're driving.  You're waving at everybody.  Hey,  what the fuck do you do?  No,  I don't drive when I drink.  No,  no, 
[00:36:30]  no.  Good.  Good.  I don't drink.  I like to drink and sit.  You know what I mean?  Just have fun,  right?  Yeah.  What's better than that?  Some people get nasty,  though.  No,  but I don't.  I just have fun,  but there have been a couple of problems on the podcast,  because we do it at like bars and stuff,  so people will come outside when I'm trying to do a show,  and they try to talk to me,  and I'm drinking.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah,  and then they start talking to my wife or Eleanor.  You know what I mean?  They belong to me.  They're with me. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah,  you got to set it straight.  You know what I mean?  You show some weakness,  they're going to be all over your shit.  So that's when I get a little angry.  How do you like the electronics,  the cigarettes?  Oh,  yeah,  you're smoking the electronics cigarette.  Do they help the craving?  Well,  you know what?  I'm smoking one,  so one of the companies,  you know,  advertised on my show  and give me like a ton of money  to advertise their electronics.  Oh.  So I won't say the electronic I'm smoking,  but if they're smart,  they get to me now.  Ah.  Because between everything going on,  there are a lot of things, 
[00:37:30]  not even on the fire,  deals I've made to do these different shows,  and it's pretty crazy again.  No shit.  And I started telling Norton in Vegas,  but you know,  I haven't seen them,  so I'd rather just hang out,  listen to the music.  You know.  Isn't that interesting that you...  And how great was L.A. Rocks at night?  How'd they kick ass?  Phenomenal.  Really great.  Do you believe that Beatles number,  The Day in a Life?  Yeah,  they did a cover.  It was...  It's their only cover.  Yeah.  Yeah,  and Dylan took that,  and he twisted and turned it,  that's like part of Day Tripper in it.  I mean,  you know, 
[00:38:00]  I was like scared to hear,  because I'm in Vegas so much,  I don't hear them rehearse.  Uh-huh.  So I heard this new song called Troublemaker,  that was a bunch of closer,  all these new things.  Oh man,  that's fucking cool.  You know what I mean?  And they're playing a lot.  And you guys got them,  you know,  we're actually looking  for the right management for them now,  because they got off of,  I gotta bring up Indestructible.  Are we supposed to bring that up?  My special?  I mean,  I would call it,  you know,  I love my first special  and my last special the best  because I wanted to give  what I would call  the ultimate rock and roll 
[00:38:30]  comedy experience.  Yeah.  You know,  and using my boys  and them playing  and then me doing my thing.  It really came out incredible.  And,  download it now,  but when does the DVD come out?  Does it say  if they want the hard copy?  It does.  It says,  the DVD is now available.  Coming out on DVD  doesn't say.  It's now available for download.  It does not say  when it's coming out on DVD.  I don't think guys  has ever come in here  with as much shit going on  in your life.  What else are you going to talk about?  I mean, 
[00:39:00]  well you did the work.  But I would tell people  to get that special  because I actually got  a text from  Joan Dangerfield,  Rodney's wife.  Uh-huh.  And she saw this,  but this is like two weeks ago  and she just sent me a text  that she was going to tape it  that night  because now they're playing  the special like crazy  on Showtime again.  Yeah.  So she was going to tape it  and she wrote,  couldn't stop watching,  flawless.  You know,  and I called her  and to hear that from,  you know,  a woman that was with Rodney  all the years,  you know,  it was pretty incredible to me. 
[00:39:30]  Hell yeah.  You know,  and people just love it  and I'm so glad I did it  because I don't want to do  another special,  I'll be honest with you.  Really?  I wanted to do,  you know,  the Diceman cometh,  you know,  to this day plays great  and I wanted to do  one more special  and just show what I got still.  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  And I was able to do that  in this special.  Well,  who knows when you're going  to be able to even do one  after you're a movie star.  Well,  that's what I'm saying.  I'm not going to,  I'm not going to tour that much  because of all these  other things going on.  I mean,  I don't know with other movies, 
[00:40:00]  but I'll do the TV show.  I got the book coming out  May 2014.  Oh, yeah.  The Filthy Truth  that I'm writing  with David Ritz.  And, you know,  this is a guy that wrote  books like Ray Charles.  They made the movie  from the book.  Etta James,  Smokey Robinson,  Marvin Gaye.  He actually wrote  the lyrics  to Sexual Healing,  you know,  which became one of them all  and he wrote the book  on Marvin.  Who wrote the lyrics  to that?  That's my favorite  Marvin Gaye song.  David Ritz. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, wow.  Okay.  David Ritz wrote that song  because he heard  the groove of the song  and he was writing  the book on Marvin  and Marvin asked him,  I don't know if,  he didn't ask him  to write lyrics,  like,  what do you think?  And he said,  it's sexual  and he wrote the work.  He's a great writer.  He just got done  with Joe Perry's book  and now he's finishing  up my book.  You know,  The Filthy Truth  and there is a mention  of you in there.  Oh, good.  Book.  Hope so.  Of course.  Special.  TVG,  movie, 
[00:41:00]  TV show.  There's a lot going on.  A lot of podcasts,  live performances.  I don't know  what the fuck is going on.  You're fucking,  how come during the lean years  you were heavy  and now you're doing a lot  and now they're heavy years  and now you're thin.  Well, think about it.  You know what?  You know,  and look,  in the book I do,  it's The Filthy Truth.  I talk about,  you know,  from like 95  to just,  you know,  three years ago,  I was in a living hell.  You know,  life takes turns. 
[00:41:30]  You know,  you get derailed.  Things like that.  And,  but I never lost  the fire in me.  I never lost that,  that feel to accomplish.  You know what I mean?  So,  yeah,  I might have got heavy  but it took that same guy  to take it off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know,  nobody could do that  but it's not even about  taking the weight.  It's about just being  physically fit  that when I get on stage,  people will say,  yeah,  I might not have as much hair.  You know what I mean?  Remember that?  Remember when you could  put a comb to your head  and there was actual hair on it? 
[00:42:00]  You know how I pick on guys  in the crowd.  I go,  remember when you could  stand your feet  and feel your fucking toes?  Remember when you touched your dick  and it actually got hard  at that second?  You didn't have to beg it?  The fuck up!  Looking at my dick  three in the morning.  Get the fuck up!  We ain't done here,  my friend.  Take a look at her!  Oh, shit.  No, but you know  what I'm saying?  So it's like  I owed it to myself  and the people  that love to come watch me  perform to look right. 
[00:42:30]  That's why I got in the shape  I did for the special.  Did you find that  sometimes you gotta,  you just have to  put the time in?  Like, enough time  has to go by  where people  not forget who you were  but can move past  the early dice  and now you could just  be you now.  It's a whole different game.  So like, but you could,  but I think only time  does that.  You gotta fucking sit it out.  You know what?  You know, um,  you know, it's like  I don't even want to  read my press right now  because like years ago 
[00:43:00]  when we were touring  with Norton, Kenny,  the whole thing  and it was all bad press.  You know what I mean?  So I just stopped reading it.  Uh-huh.  That's how I feel  with the good press.  You know,  because I would read  those articles years ago  and go,  well, they don't even  fucking know me  so what do I give a shit  what they think?  You know what I mean?  So today they're writing  great stuff.  That's great.  But I don't have to read it.  I know me.  You know,  I know the things  I talk to them about  and if they write it up  the right way  it'll be a good interview.  Well, when people write things  if it's good  then they know everything  and they're perfect  and they're very smart. 
[00:43:30]  Did you see the Playboy thing yet?  Did you read the Playboy?  No, you're in Playboy too.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's like a  six, seven page profile.  I mean,  they're writing these things now  that are pretty unbelievable  to me  but I don't want to get  overwhelmed by it.  I just want to...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know,  with all this press  that was coming  with the Woody movie coming  I got kind of overwhelmed  and I would talk to my wife  and my kids  and people the closest to me  and my son Dylan  said it the best  like about a month ago. 
[00:44:00]  He said,  shut up dad  and quit whining.  No, it wasn't about whining  it was about  like hearing about yourself  too much.  It was like too overwhelming again.  I was used to being  where I was at  you know,  for the last like 12 years  and my son Dylan  he goes,  you know what dad?  Just own it.  That's why you started  in this to start with.  So just own it now.  And he was right  and the next day  I woke up  I was like,  alright, bring it on.  Yeah, yeah.  This is what's  you know, 
[00:44:30]  meant to go on.  This is great.  Well, it's  unbelievable.  You got so much going on.  It's fantastic.  We got to wrap up  because we're done here.  We cover everything.  We cover everything.  I think we did.  Nothing but the most  memorable ONA appearances  from the biggest names  in comedy.

[00:49:30]  from the biggest names  in stand-up.  A very chippers  in Thanksgiving continues  on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Yeah, this next guy,  Patton,  you know,  Mr. I-know-what-I'm-talking-about.  He starts off,  he talks about loving O&A  and breaking down  the whole Yakov dinner adventure.  Maybe you think that's funny,  but I got things to do.  He talks a lot about  reading Moby Dick.  That's good reading.  That's good American reading.  It's all this pornography  and smut.  I just want to  just go to the job site, 
[00:50:00]  make my living,  come home,  support my family,  have a dinner roll.  What's he up to?  Well, we're going to find out  what Patton Oswalt  is all about.  We were having  a nice conversation.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he was talking  about an old clip  from our show  that I think  his brother gave him,  and he loved it.  Patton, how you doing, man?  I love him.  What's slapping him?  You want to tell  what we were talking about?  Because it's definitely  worth mentioning on the air.  It's the clip of you,  someone combined it on YouTube,  it's the clip of you guys  dissecting 
[00:50:30]  Barry Williams'  Branson show,  and then goes right  into Yakov's  Dinner Adventure.  I think I've watched that,  I'm not exactly,  but probably like  ten times at this point.  Oh, my God.  Especially because  that's my nightmare  for where my career  would end up.  Of like,  okay, you've got to think  about this crowd  and what they,  because what really  is scary about that clip  is what they're selling  is for one night  you get to have 
[00:51:00]  the world  the way you want it,  which is nice  and quiet  and slow  and it's nice.  Remember when the woman  was like,  you kept the food hot?  And she goes,  I don't know how you did it.  And you realize  these probably,  what these people  can afford is  a lot of places  where the food  probably isn't hot  and they don't  cook it really well  and there's nothing  they can say about it.  They have no power  anymore.  So it's like,  for one night  it's a world  where the food is hot  and there's no blacks.  All this night 
[00:51:30]  you get to have  the world  like it was  in 1941  when you were still  healthy  and you weren't  looking at death.  Oh my God.  We might have to  podcast that soon.  Write it down.  Great assessment  of that.  And then the magnetic  trays we were talking  about  and there was a reason  for the magnetic  trays.  There was a reason  for the magnetic  trays.  They realized  if we get rid  of the tables  we can pack  200 more people  into this room  and seat them  and feed them  like pigs. 
[00:52:00]  Like literally  and I think  one of you guys  were saying  yeah and when  the show's over  you know  they just  take a fire hose  to the floor  and tables  and just wash  it into a sluice gate  probably at the bottom  of the auditorium  and they just get  the next round  of pigs in.  Because they do  like five shows  a day  like get them in.  Move.  Move.  Oh my God.  Yes.  And then also  the care  that my personal  chef takes  and as he's  saying it  there's footage  of just mass  trays coming out  with plastic 
[00:52:30]  covers  to keep it hot  like the visual  totally negates  everything that  he's bragging  about.  That he's saying  yes.  My personal chef  saying he totally  slaves over this  slaving over  the frozen chicken  cordon bleu.  That he gets  by the fucking  like the shipping  containers  are out back  full of chicken  cordon bleu.  You don't think  if Jeff was making  it all fresh?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  Well it's weird  that he says  that he's making  it fresh  and yet they show  a platoon  of frightened  Venezuelans  who are working 
[00:53:00]  in his kitchen  that are terrified  of being hit.  Like it is  the most horrifying.  Oh God.  That's so many.  It's one of our  greatest discoveries  ever.  I'm fascinated.  When we learned  about this.  With Branson  that whole thing  that like  we were watching  that guy  what's his name  Kirby the Magician  and it was like  this horrible  trying to look  like Vegas  thing  but the tricks  just weren't  good  and it wasn't 
[00:53:30]  the glitz  it was Branson.  Also you gotta  you watch it  and realize  oh wait  this is 9.30  in the morning  this isn't  rat pack stuff  this is  and then we're  gonna have  my nap  afterward  and then  3 o'clock  dinner  and then  we'll go  to sleep  and that's  waiting for  so many of us.  I told Pat  if he enjoyed that  he has to do  the Joe Piscopo  one we did  where you came  in that day  and said  you gotta see  this Showtime  Joe Piscopo special.  I woke up  in the middle  of the night  opened my eye 
[00:54:00]  and Joe Piscopo  was on  it was a new  special that he had  and it was  Club Piscopo  it was called  and it's like  him going  doodle you  do  just doing  like Frank  Sinatra stuff  telling stories  in between  the songs  this was recent  yes  most recent  Showtime special  maybe a year ago  at this point  I was  stupefied  when I was  in Staten Island  I was telling  Opie that  he has a 
[00:54:30]  he had it  when I was there  he had like  a residency  at some hotel  that he was  doing  like out  on Staten Island  which I thought  that's kind of  cool  like he's out  like while you're  in Manhattan  doing stuff  out on Staten Island  Joe Piscopo  is going up  right now  and doing  a show  but  a whole show  is that like  on  can I  I just got  XM Radio  Satellite 103  I got that  station  which has you  guys on  and I just  look so  nice  riding around  LA  it justifies  all my anger 
[00:55:00]  Iraq's actually  going to  burn a CD  of the Joe Piscopo  thing for you  oh man  I think you would  enjoy that  if you liked  the Yakov  slash Barry Williams  stuff  well the Yakov thing  is great  because they  match the visuals  to everything  you guys are talking  about  which really  adds to the  horror  of what you're  seeing  like  as bad  as your  descriptions are  all the visuals  back up  every single thing  you're saying  yeah  I'm hoping  someone does that  with the Happy Days  thing we did  yesterday  oh yeah  because that'll  do really well  and discovered 
[00:55:30]  a Happy Days  episode  where they  handle the  the racial issue  the racial issue  it was  Tom Bodley  has a black  friend  it was one  of the original  ones  not in front  of the live  studio audience  it was done  on film  it was one  of the original  ones  and yeah  he was going  to be the  best man  at a black  guy's wedding  and they had  the black  guy at his  house  and they had  the stereotypical  neighbor come  over and go  oh  she's all  like scared  because he's  a black  guy  we watched  the whole episode  yesterday  on this show  well there's  also that clip  where you guys  I can't believe 
[00:56:00]  I'm like  it's like  I'm a nerd  that won  win a morning  with opium  and then  remember that  one episode  that you did  when you  but there's  this episode  where you guys  dissected  and this is also  on YouTube  the Dudley  episode  of  in which  the line  you uttered  the line  Dudley's  a goer  but then  somebody  there was  a website  I think  it's  College  Humor  or it might  be on the  website  but they  pointed out  all those  very special 
[00:56:30]  episodes  where a kid  is molested  or someone  is raped  or someone  has cancer  or overdoses  those were  live tapings  for an audience  most of which  had traveled  from the Midwest  like we're  going to go  to LA  we're going  to go see  a show  and they've  bought a ticket  and they've  sat there  for four hours  to watch  a kid  get raped  their big  Hollywood trip  ends with  watching a show  about a kid  being molested  they just  wanted to  laugh 
[00:57:00]  I thought  you were  saying they  were the  lucky audience  and it was  the best  birthday I  ever had  they just  wanted to  escape  one of those  shows  it's a comedy  we all laugh  we watch it  every week  and they've  got to sit  there for the  audience  that goes  that low  like  the one time  they hear  Arnold say  what you  talking about  it's to a  man about  to rape  his friend  in a  fucking  empty tub  what you  talking about  it's not the  same  catchphrase  isn't as  fun 
[00:57:30]  it's actually  it's really  what you  talking about  this is our  anniversary  we do like  picking things  apart on this  show  the happy days  one is the  latest one  that was  yesterday  it was fun  fun to  watch them  juggle  the racial  issue  and  it was  scary  marshal  style  yes  it was  done  so  ham  handedly  you got a  clip there  Sam  awful  or no  I have 
[00:58:00]  I'm just  looking up  to see  what's  out  there's a  four and a  half hour  youtube  video  which is  all parts  the saga  of you guys  and Joe  Piscopo  wow  are there  visuals  and stuff  I think  there are  some  throughout  the next  day  we had  him  on the  show  yeah  it was  a  trilogy  it's  five parts  Iraq  is saying  and then  he started  coming in  and he's  getting girls  pregnant  all over  the place 
[00:58:30]  we're like  stop  he's an  animal  we love  him  in the end  we love  the guy  he loves  throwing  that seed  around  that  Piscopo  seed  man he  just knocks  these young  girls up  he's got to  fertilize  the earth  when the earth  loses its  Piscopo  the dead  will walk  the earth  that's why  Piscopo  we can get him  on the phone  right now  if you want  to say  hi  Jesus  I wouldn't  know what  to say  want a quick  phone call  with Joe  we put the  whole thing  on a podcast  too so it's  out there  I'm telling you  the Joe Piscopo  stuff is terrific 
[00:59:00]  I love he just  refuses to pull out  like I really  respect him  he's had nothing  but bad luck  and he just  won't stop  fucking aiming  for the womb  he is a fertile  guy  holy shit  this guy's  back in fucking  870  with hall of fame  numbers  I almost  want to just  play  Joe Piscopo  that's great  oh so much  fun  so you're all  over channel  11 here in  New York  you're all  over that  the king  of queens  and then I 
[00:59:30]  turn on  you're at the  video store  in Seinfeld  oh yeah  that role  that was  my first  TV role  and that's  the classic  first timer  on TV  I'm basically  I'm there  just to set  up  Jason  and I was  going to do  something funny  and I'm  trying to get  a laugh  from my  like  all I'm  saying is  I'm sorry  sir it  doesn't work  that way  and I'm  putting so  much spin  on each  of my  words  I'm going to  make something  myself  nothing  so  someone has 
[01:00:00]  it  oh no  I've been to  four other  places  you're the only  ones that have  had it  well I can  put it on  reserve for you  if you'd like  maybe we could  call them  and ask them  to turn  oh sorry  we can't do  that  boom  I don't think  so  it doesn't  work that  way  doesn't work  that way  oh  damn it  and then it's  my back  that was 
[01:00:30]  one of your  first times  on TV  though  that was  my  very first  paid acting  gig on TV  wow  that's  pretty cool  the first one  1994  good for you  wow  and then I got  a call to start  well after it  aired I got  this call from  not even a  friend of mine  from this  acquaintance  that was like  hey I checked  you out on TV  I'm like oh hey  thanks man  he goes yeah  you know I'm  thinking  maybe I'm  getting in acting  now you know  like I was  thinking about  this 
[01:01:00]  and I go oh  and there's a guy  that never was  and I go oh  okay he goes yeah  so I'm gonna  maybe come if I  came out like I  could crash in  your spare room  or something  and I said well  I'm living in a  studio apartment  my bed is in  my kitchen  and he's like  oh come on man  I just saw you  on TV  and now you're  trying to  I go what do  you mean  he goes wow  you have a house  I saw you on  TV you have a  house  just because  you're  yeah  I made less  on that  cake  than I have  on any  that basically 
[01:01:30]  got me an  after card  I didn't even  get money  off of that  so  people actually  will think  that  I was guilty  of the same  thing with  our own  Greg Opie Hughes  here  back when  I was just  doing Opie's  show  from 7 to  midnight  that was a  big deal  as a single  out on Long  Island  I'll check  your Wikipedia  page  WBAB  is out  on Long  Island  doing very  well  for myself  and I  would come  in like  maybe once  a week  and do  something  and then  I was like  oh you 
[01:02:00]  know  why don't you  come over  to my house  we'll hang  out  I'm like  holy fuck  this is  fucking cool  and he  tells me  where to go  and I'm  driving  I'm like  wait  this isn't  this isn't  this should  be like  a gated  community  and then  I pull  up to  this house  and he's  like hey  what's up  and I look  around  and it's  just  a shitty  house  and I  don't even  have the  whole house  and I'm  like  and then  I started  thinking  because it  was in  Northport  and I'm  just kind  of like  oh this  must just  be a  summer home 
[01:02:30]  like Opie's  summering  in Northport  you know how  people go to  Northport  just to chill  out  it was an  old house  a lot of  rusted shit  in the yard  and the  backyard  yeah yeah  I was just  like oh man  I thought  I thought  he's a horrible  landlord  he's got his  own radio show  he's got to  be wealthy  what'd you guys  do in the  house together  that day  yeah that's  we actually  watched uh  the crow  did we really  yeah it was  the crow  there's something  so creepy  about you guys 
[01:03:00]  in the house  watching the crow  it's so random  little did we know  the future  would be this  and it was  I remember though  because it was like  there was no lights  on either  it was really dark  you're off  the air  at midnight  going for  two in the  morning  fucking brew  and crow  in the house  like in that  little living room  area  I didn't have  money to pay  the electric bill  it's so funny  if you guys  watching the crow  at two in the  morning  you're like  I have plans  to conquer  New York  talking about  what's gonna happen  yes 
[01:03:30]  but it continued  in Boston  we were kicking  ass together now  and we weren't  making any money  no  we finally made  money when we  came back to New York  I realized very  quickly that that  was a fallacy  that if you're  on the radio  you're wealthy  we were huge  in Boston  and we were  still struggling  yeah  more or less  yeah  Opie was living  with my mother-in-law  yeah  I lived with her  for six months  going fuck  that's six months  of rent  I don't have to deal  with  right right  you can get  savings or something  yes  we moved in  we all were  living there  me  my wife  at the time  and Opie 
[01:04:00]  and the mother-in-law  living in her  little fucking  townhouse  but my wife  and her mother  got along so poorly  that it was like  day one  she's like  I'm getting the fuck  out of here  I gotta get away  from this bitch  and I go to Ann  and I'm like  oh you guys are  leaving but  this is great  I like this  she cooks dinner  she actually did my  laundry  I think she made  the bed every day  when I went to  do the radio show  with Ann  and my chick at the time  didn't want to  move to Boston  so I'm like  what the fuck  I'll just stay 
[01:04:30]  where I am  that's what I was  thinking at the time  too  it was kind of like  oh I could  fucking you know  save up some money  how we got into  this  this is depressing  all the millennials  out there  yeah can we get  off on a different  subject right now  because I'm living  with my parents  I have a lot of  grief  for God's sakes  yes  the Biscopo saga  the Biscopo saga  sorry I'm looking  at the  I don't even know  if you need the  visual on that one  I think you could  just pop that  we play a little  oh you drive it 
[01:05:00]  around  I lived at home  until I was 30  and you know how  I remember I met  a girl in Vegas  when I was opening  for Dice at the  fucking Venetian  and she thought  I was fucking  hot shit  and I was joking  with her  I was being sarcastic  I'm like yeah  I got a Jag  and a Benz  and she's like  really  oh no  she believed it  and then she  fucking  I flew her to  Jersey  where I lived  with Florentine  oh no  and I'll never  forget when she  saw what a  fucking hunk  of garbage  my apartment  was  because I had  the roof  leaking  remember  she's like  do you have  any vodka  and I gave  her fucking 
[01:05:30]  vodka  and I just  taught her chess  in my living room  it was fucking  that was your  that was my time  I felt so bad  about that  black mold  on the walls  we did a cribs  with Jim Norton  we actually went  through his place  when I was 33  it was unbelievable  how much mold  he had in that joint  it was terrible  I love how she  immediately goes  do you have  any vodka  can I just  numb this  that's what it was  that's what it was  I'm about to get  surgery in the old west  just give me  some bourbon  and let's get  this over with  where's the Benz  you gotta tell  them real fast  before we move  on out of the shit  you would bring  girls back to 
[01:06:00]  your parents house  in my late 20s  yeah I'd get  blown in the fuck  I remember me  and my friend  Larry got a  fucking pregnant  prostitute in my  fucking grandmother's  where she's dead  but in her basement  and this girl  spiked up a crack pipe  she spiked up a  fucking crack  I'll never forget that  in grandma's house  yeah in one of my  parents' houses  oh in your parents' house  Jim you casually  rushed by about  eight  just to get to  the point of your  story  I got to blow this  pregnant prostitute  in my grandma  she's dead  wait a minute  we're just rushing 
[01:06:30]  by all that shit  where are we heading  what's the kicker  of this  of all that  it's just the  illusion of wealth  people have  they think that  you're doing better  in show business  they have no idea  yeah that is true  I lived in this house  just show them the  photo of being pulled  up  I lived in this house  until I was doing  comedy for 13 years  10 years to 13 years  is when I lived here  just the photo  don't even show them  the whole house  it's too long  oh lord  there's all the mold  on the ceiling  oh god  this is online  if you guys want  to check it out  oh behind that  picture 
[01:07:00]  that is disgusting  look at it  the mold is leaking  watch when they  lift that picture up  this is so fucking  yeah they were  hiding the mold  with that picture  obviously  no  I don't  yes  there's mold  there we go  okay they are  lifting a picture up  oh god  yep  oh no  that's like  Amityville horror  shit  that's a  shitload of mold  oh  and it's under  of course  a nice framed  Chagall  yes  yeah that's my 
[01:07:30]  framed Chagall  isn't that like  isn't that that  weird brain eating  mold  that you have to  flee the house  once you have it  yes  yeah  yeah I think so  this doesn't seem  that long ago  it's gotta be 13  years ago right  what are we in  2013  oh god  yeah it's 13  years ago  yeah I'd been at  it probably  nearly 20 years  where I could  afford a house  there's just  there's not that  much  people see you  because you have  so much exposure  people don't realize 
[01:08:00]  that fame and  fortune are usually  completely opposite  yeah  you know you can  be very famous  and have zero  fortune  yeah  yeah it really  is a fucking  long process  to make any  kind of fucking  real money man  people are so  disappointed when  they realize  oh man  yeah  broke  if you're on  TV you have a  shit load of  money that's the  the illusion  and then when you  start making money  one of the first  things you have to  do is start paying  off all the debt  you accrue to  even get like I  had to I had so 
[01:08:30]  much debt that  there was nothing I  could do about it  like I have to keep  living in this debt  because this is the  life I'm living and  then I was thank  god I was able to  finally pay it off  exactly yes that  happened to me too  with credit cards and  shit I was like I  just I I just  resigned to the  fact that I am  going to be paying  the minimum balance  yep for the rest  of my life oh  yeah how many  times I I remember  one time oh god  okay I was in San  Francisco my phone  got cut off because  I hadn't paid the  bill so I had to  walk down I was  rolling nickels in  quarters I had a  huge bucket of 
[01:09:00]  change and I sat  there for a few  hours and rolled  enough to literally  I had like two  hundred dollars in  nickels I had them  in a big bag a  trash bag and I  walked down to the  uh the office the  the phone company  office where you  literally can  pay it in person  and get it turned  on right there  yeah so I'm  lugging this trash  bag down Clement  Street so I can go  pay my bill and  there's this kid a I  was like 20 at the  time he was like  17 a able-bodied  totally healthy young 
[01:09:30]  kid uh begging on  Clement Street just  like yeah you're  getting changed like  just again this is  like early 90s and  I was like I am  really sorry I don't  have any money and  I actually stopped  there's no reason to  talk to this this  right I'm like I  gotta go pay this  phone I have just  enough to pay it I  gotta get my phone  turned back on and  I because I'm trying  to be a member of  society you able-bodied  young man so then I  go to the office I pay  it but I was like I  like 87 cents left  like oh I actually had  more than I thought I  was so happy that when  I was going back I  passed him and I 
[01:10:00]  went hey man look I  got I got some change  and I gave him my  change I was in such a  good mood oh man and  then he stopped and he  went you said you were  broke you fucking  asshole  holy shit so okay  then yeah got it yeah  yeah yeah you don't  realize people can rip  you off on credit  cards too that's a  problem when like you  get into credit card  debt I was like I had  three thousand dollars  on each one and then  all of a sudden I had  like a ten thousand  dollar hit well I  used to go to these  prostitutes and pay 
[01:10:30]  with a credit card I  really would it would  never occur to me that  they would rip you off  oh really the  prostitutes wouldn't  rip you off yeah so  I had fucking I had  to call and fucking  get ten thousand  dollars for the  fucking bullshit  charges they got on  my credit cards  well that's weird  because you haven't  seen the uh the  Jim memorial uh  Jim uh Norton  memorial thank you  from all the  prostitutes for all  the rice cookers  and uh you know  laundry machines you  bought them there's  a whole oh that  joke went fucking oh  my god could not  have been sweatier or  clankier Jim did 
[01:11:00]  you see the  one time oh fuck  clankier I literally  limped my way towards  a non-punny line  right I threw out a  dumb story that there  really was nowhere to  go with I gave you the  beginning middle and  end there's nowhere to  go with it why that's  an amazing story without  the details I didn't  mention there were  trannies I mean believe  me I didn't throw that  in but Jim's face was  literally he was it was  I was like again I was  like a special kid  let's let him tell his  story and then when 
[01:11:30]  you oh god Jimmy what  when when a pregnant  hooker shows up are  you are you pissed she  didn't show up we  picked her up oh  how pregnant eight and  a half months nine  months oh my god yeah  no bullshit no no  no problem with it I  don't remember why we  did that I remember she  blew both of us she  blew me and Larry and  then she sparked up a  crack pipe right by my  grandmother's old book  case and she had a  copy of Johnny we  hardly knew ye in the  bookcase about JFK 
[01:12:00]  maybe they were just  Jimmy and his family  were reading the good  earth they're like oh  that seems to get  birds in the rice  field let's just try to  recreate that was there  any guilt yeah a little  bit that she was eight  and a half nine months  pregnant yeah no it was  the drugs I felt bad  about like ah man it's  that secure smoke coke  when it's being cooked  it's a fucking no it's a  very distinct odor it was  where my parents would  fucking smell it oh man  were they upstairs at  the time yeah you  bring a fucking  pregnant hooker into  the downstairs part of  the house when your 
[01:12:30]  parents I remember being  nervous like just having  a girl over on the  couch doing normal  fucking shit you know  making out and dry  humping you were  worried that we'd come  check it out right  what was that is that  not a pregnant hooker  smoking crack next to  Johnny we hardly knew  ye I can't wait till  Jim gets his Louie  style show and his  pitching stories yeah well  so in this episode is a  pregnant like three  months oh no nice got  to be nine like right  should we smoke and  crack trust me Jim 
[01:13:00]  already has that show  written and yeah trying  to get rid of it can we  get the clearance to use  the book Johnny we  hardly do I need that in  the shot I need that to  frame the left side of  her face yeah because  she's doing it some  physical camera has to  pan to that before  commercial so Pat what  are you promoting we  didn't even mention  Pat's promoting right  yeah whatever happened to  Moby Dick is that a book  you've written yeah I'm  saying no oh I'm uh I  there's two things I'm  doing I'm the next  Tuesday is the season 
[01:13:30]  two premiere of the  heart she holler uh which  is a adult swim show that  the guys did they do  wonder shows I don't  know if you ever watch  wonder shows and it's  wonder shows and is  amazing it's this it's  like a it's like if if  Sesame Street run bath  salts and they go and  just drive people in New  York insane and and do  they have these things  like uh kids on the  street kids on the beat  beat kids beat kids and  it's like kids doing the  news so there's a kid  they address the kid as  Hitler and then he's 
[01:14:00]  talking to me like what's  wrong with what do you  think is wrong with the  youth of today like these  old people like why are  you addressing Hitler like  they're so upset and then  they also send this kid to  the racetrack to talk to  just these old people to  racetrack this one little  kid's like I can do an  impression of you and this  sweet old man's like  really yeah gamble gamble  gamble die so those guys  did this show called the  heart she holler which is  like think of the think of 
[01:14:30]  the most annoying Brooklyn  hipster and what they think  the south is they think a  red state is and then give  that person bath salts and  that's what the show is it's  just this insane inbred and  we did six episodes two  years ago and adult swim  liked it so much they went  why don't you do 14 more  we're gonna run them every  single night of the month  like a soap opera oh it's  just weird they're each like  11 minutes long and it's the  most nice short shows on  adults they do very short  yeah it has that nice like 
[01:15:00]  cool if it's only 11 minutes  just do 11 minutes make it  great yeah and and it is the  most disgusting shit I've ever  done on camera oh wow  weirdest shit I've ever done  if you want to watch like  people crawling into women's  vaginas and and a a woman  there's a scene they showed  last night they did a thing  at the Nighthawk in Brooklyn  where a where a guy oh god  this is so gross um I'll  base I'll just put it this  way he she a woman does him 
[01:15:30]  from behind because something  is sticking out of his rear that  she is riding but and I'll just  leave it at that it's horrifying  I would gather she's sharing a  dildo with his asshole you know  what see that would be nice no  it's something oh nice a very  solid log there thank you wow I  didn't want to be the one to say  it so but it's it's brilliant it is  a it's a brilliant show and then  the and then now that I've said  all that next Saturday the 21st in 
[01:16:00]  LA I'm doing the the Los Angeles  Public Library is doing this  celebration of Moby Dick wow look  at that you're all over three  readings I'm just gonna go to  three different libraries and  read sections from Moby Dick  which um they've sent me these  sections I mean I've never read  all of Moby Dick I'm gonna  admit it oh sorry um that is a  seriously fucked up book yeah some  of the stuff that goes on in that  book it's just pages and pages of 
[01:16:30]  just psychosis that so I'm gonna be  reading some of the weirdest parts  are you gonna put on a dramatic  reading voice I think I'm gonna put  on I'm gonna try to and then I'm  gonna get confused and angry  because these passages are really  really weird I didn't know that  Herman Melville was so  twisted yeah twist like a  damaged guy yeah how long is his  passage each and like a page and a  half like really quick and then I'll  talk to the audience about like what  the hell just happened like and  there'll be people there that you 
[01:17:00]  know there's there's already people  like because I was announcing it on  Twitter and then they're like hey  make sure to read this passage  because and like I've been looking  some of them up and they're they're  really hard there's some twisted  shit in there like it's fucking  captain and the cabin boy and shit  and there's a lot of like there's  all this there's all these  references or at least they allude to  the idea that he's gone to he hates  this whale so much that he's gone to  all these islands of different  savages and he's storing these like  Zoroastrians and he's crazy  religious fanatics but he keeps them 
[01:17:30]  stored like under the decks and they  just sit there smoking weed all day  and going crazy and the minute the  whale services he's gonna like let  these maniacs loose to go kill this  thing so on the on the on the deck of  the ship is Quee Quag and Ishma and  all these guys but then underneath of  it it's like the gathering of the  juggalos and he's just giving them  all PCP throw them out like a  cluster bomb exactly it's amazing  yeah I had no idea I've never read 
[01:18:00]  the book no I don't either I know  nothing I might have to read that  one that's cool I just hear the name  and giggle yeah can't help it well  also what I didn't know about the  book was Herman Melville was this  hugely successful like killer diller  author of money fame and then he spent  all these years writing his great  American and it ruined him and he  died penniless and kind of really yeah  this thing just ate him alive and he  wouldn't and they put it out  everyone hated it like all their  reviews like this is the worst most 
[01:18:30]  unreadable piece of shit this guy  flushed his career down the toilet  when did it become a classic I think  like 50 years after he was dead Wow  yeah it was really weird it just kind of  just kind of blew it so damn yeah it was  just it was a guy like imagine like  imagine think of like Bruce Springsteen  and then all of a sudden for the he  stops doing music for 10 years and it  comes out with this weird a tonal like  he's just banging on like a weird like  a penis penis yeah four hours and 
[01:19:00]  everyone's like that's it is all I'm  doing from now on like God he's going  and then he just ends up like dying in a  men's hotel somewhere but then 50 years  later people think that's the greatest  album ever do you know the history of  how it turned it around and how it  became that I don't I still got to read  that part because it's an amazing it is  a fascinating story about a guy burning  his life right around and then that  becomes a thing he's and then his big  bestseller books no one gives a shit  about yeah we're bestsellers during his  lifetime no one reads when did he what 
[01:19:30]  was his life in death years roughly  that I see I don't know did he die in  the 1900s or the I think he died in the  late 1800s but don't quote me yeah there  you go get on Wikipedia have to do that  yeah he's also his other big one of his  big bestsellers was called umo o-o-m-o  and if you do crossword puzzles you see  that a lot yeah just says Melville  novel oh this person needs vowels in  his puzzles so here comes umo get no  umo because that's gonna be the one in 
[01:20:00]  there well you got uh 1819 to 1891  I lived the fucking what was he 72  almost man 72 years old right lived a  long life died miserable you doing  animation still yeah I do well you know  now I I because my daughter is four and  we watch all these animated shows and  then sometimes I'll tweet about him like  is it like um I can't get the the doc  mcstuffins tune out of my head of course  and then they'll call me and go hey you  want to do a voice like all my all of

[01:26:00]  funny and i was needy that's that when  we were going through old radio stuff i  was i was so happy to be there months  out of doing construction so i was just  so happy you're gonna pass i'm like oh my  god i'm so everything was so like oh  yeah  i was just so eager to like anything i'd  throw in an imitation do i must perform  because the attic was waiting for you 
[01:26:30]  yes that attic was you kind of have a  pass oh you came out of this kid this  kid this kid he came out of nowhere  though but it is you know that i started  and that's where he's going i started  this shit when i was 18 he can't he's in  his 30s comes out of nowhere fucking  boom oh you know what you know what his  advantage was and yours too is because  you started young and you started from  with the past you had you had this cliff  of darkness behind you of there's nothing 
[01:27:00]  to fall back on like so you've got to  work twice it makes you work twice as  hard when you have got nothing yeah yeah  nothing like i had when i started doing  stand-up i kind of blew everything else  right and i realized i can't work in  every office i got i worked in either  people hated me or i hated it i had a  terrible attitude because it's so i'm  just like i have a cliff to my back yeah  if i fall back i will fall off the  planet gone so you're one of those people  that well they fell through the cracks of  society i literally that's where i would 
[01:27:30]  have ended up i would have yeah all those  guys almost made it oh yeah because  that's the other side of this i just  guys that almost made but had the cliff  at their back and they fucking fell uh  how many how many whatever reason  geniuses do we know truly visionary  guys that just never they're just gone  or they're still around but what do you  do they made bad decisions a lot of  them or they a lot of people wanted to  just work the big road headliners of  like 1992 i started 1990 and a lot of  those guys began in the 80s and they 
[01:28:00]  they headlined before they were ready  because the 80s had a fucking million  clubs so everyone got the headline oh  yeah and then they got bottlenecks  squeezed out in the fucking early 90s  and they couldn't find work and like  those guys that would work in like  92 93 they're gone now yeah no  because the rule a lot of those rooms  aren't around so also they got used to  a certain lifestyle yeah i make this  much money i do this and the people  that survived when the boom stopped and  there were people that did make it but  those the ones are like i got to get  some other shitty job and keep doing 
[01:28:30]  stand-up until it comes around again  yeah yeah they do that but you're  right there were some people that are  like um you know i used to headline at  uh yeah you used to headline in a  club chain that does not exist it  doesn't even exist anymore no one  cares yeah yeah and there were also  those guys that well you know they  wrote their 45 minutes and then they  just i'm just i'm done writing yep  exactly that's my life yeah my life is  comic i don't understand those guys  why would i go on stage for no money  you see some of those guys come  through you know once a year and you  go see them you're like that what are  you doing same thing same exact thing 
[01:29:00]  isn't it fun i thought it was fun  writing jokes that was the whole point  of doing this you get to you have to  do the same shit over and over again  new stuff yeah those guys if i'm  merciless with those guys they're  fucking lazy yeah think you're  fucking lazy yeah write a joke or try a  joke they were the same fucking  yeah yeah shit inflection for 10 years  oh fuck you fuck you i i on hbo uh i  think it's hbo classic comedy whatever  the fuck it is uh they they play a lot  of the old specials from the 80s and 
[01:29:30]  and stuff and you see these guys  and you're like oh yeah that guy and  he had like a little a little fame back  then you realize you never saw this guy  after like the boom of uh stand-up  comedy just they're gone are they i was  gonna ask are they still doing comedy  but in some weird fucking even knows  places or disappear something yeah  disappear man a lot of them a lot of  the guys that i started with in dc uh  these headliners ended up on uh morning  radio doing am oh really not like not  like satellite stuff i mean like am 
[01:30:00]  local and angry conservative you know  like there was guy i remember a guy that  i used to work with and we weren't really  friends work with him and he was going  off about well you know i used to be a  comedian and black people in clubs let  me tell you something because i've  actually experienced it i'm like yeah  it was well but it was like i see what  you're saying but you're basing for you're  basing a political philosophy on three  bad nights that you had a garbage which 
[01:30:30]  by the way were bad nights like that  was his argument with the call yeah oh  god you ever do garbage no but i remember  the name from dc garbage was there their  big claim to fame they're gone is that  they uh uh they had dave chapelle starting  out he uh got his start there and they  treated him like such absolute dog shit  yeah that he left for new york and then  i remember a club another club not  garvin's but one a lot like garvin's  dave chapelle was getting ready for his  first hour they're killing him softly 
[01:31:00]  and he called his managers called the  club and said dave would like to do the  weekend you can have him for eight  hundred dollars for the whole week and  he just wants to do sets you know this  last minute you just all you got to do  is give me eight hundred bucks so you  know this is dave chapelle you know  right he probably just wanted some  money it's already dave chapelle to pay  for exactly and and they wouldn't pay  him they wouldn't do it and then i  heard the two managers talking and one  of them was like fucking kid used to  emcee here for 25 bucks a set five  years ago and suddenly got to give him 
[01:31:30]  eight hundred dollars of like well  because he's not the kid you like in  their mind you're just frozen there and  that yeah yeah you're still the same  piece how great is it they're gone how  great oh they're all the whole thing  just collapsed that's great yeah yeah  it is nice when you get a club from a  scumbag club a club owner running it and  then it just goes belly up good yeah  fuck yeah oh it's the it's just it  happened with bands too and we used to  play and uh you know at the end of the 
[01:32:00]  night you go to get paid and there's  always a problem you know well you know  we have the door count and it was this  it's like we had our own guy with it  and i you know i gotta go with my guy  and you're like you just really gonna  screw me on 25 people you prick like  like you you do realize this can't  sustain like eventually your club is  just gonna collapse right right there's  no way if you keep pissing the talent  off no one will fucking everyone over  right yeah yeah that's fast and they all 
[01:32:30]  try to they all try to fuck you for  eight seats or ten seats or now we're  doing a golden ticket thing you know but  you weren't supposed to because we have a  contracted ticket price they all try to  get an extra few dollars see that's what  again if they were trying to fuck me  over for 20 grand i would at least  right right i'm dealing with a super  villain but when you're when you're  dealing with someone i mean like you're  i just talked to you for 20 minutes  because you were trying to get like  48 dollars out of me that's what that's 
[01:33:00]  yeah i'd be crazy yeah yeah just yeah  that much and it's weird when you have  these these like old clubs that like for  years you worked in and then you  realize that it's 2013 and you're going  back to the comedy cabaret at poco's  restaurant in doyle's town oh jimmy  tickets are on sale now i'm working on  my new hour so i'm just going to just to  work i'm gonna have like maybe some paper  with me and just work on that's cool  yeah i when i was doing this i just  taped my new special uh in july and i

[01:34:00]  the art gallery i then had to go edit  down in oh wow it really helped it was  really that's really smart yeah i love  doing stuff like that i usually do that  right before a specialist shot like i'll  usually go into smaller rooms and just  completely but that's you know you're  seeing the special almost this is i  probably have since i shot probably 35  new already yeah about five months it's  been five months but uh 30 minutes so i  would say uh you know you'll have close  to a new 45 and i'll play with the  crowd a little bit but i love doing that  that's great colin in uh long island 
[01:34:30]  city when he was just starting working  on the last constitutional yeah  unconstitutional kidding and it was  fucking it was great just watch him  and he'd go through something and be  like oh well that don't work  but it was great just watching him  throw that shit around and try to  and he said the same thing on hbo when  he does it  fucking funny is he it's amazing it's  depressing it really is fantastic i could

[02:01:00]  remember my he him and his wife were supposed to meet us in the hot tub and just he came out  oh that's doug henning came out doug henning gets in with my wife and i and i saw her look at she gave  me that look like what's going on and she went i'm very uncomfortable with you rubbing my leg jim likes  his legs rubbed and went don't you know what he's talking about so he started the guy was rubbing 
[02:01:30]  her legs yeah and then he started massaging my legs in the hot tub he didn't take that as a hint to get  the fuck out no dude that's how stupid i am i can easily be raped one day i know i can i almost was  without even knowing you don't want to make a scene yes just because i don't want to that's so stupid  so you're allowing doug henning to rub your legs so doug henning brings me up to his bedroom i'd be  like what are you from the hot tub the next day he talks me into this and i go all right d i'll go 
[02:02:00]  first did he hold your hand as you walked i go in there and it's next to his bed the massage table's  next to his bed and he goes i had my underwear he goes you know normally people take the clothes off  so i take the clothes off and i'm just laying there's no sheet over me oh my god naked raw meat  and he starts getting a little a little too a little too much in between the legs yeah yeah 
[02:02:30]  hitting the balls with the finger yeah holy fuck and then when the massage jim yeah when i had to turn  over oh no i was like i called it quits oh now you drew the line yeah i'm like yeah i'm not  comfortable with this side and then went downstairs like you're not gonna like to and then we left and  we went and we stayed in a park until night time we sat there we parked next to a creek until night time  we came back in the house slept and the next day we checked out but i clearly could have been 
[02:03:00]  why didn't you check out that day and just go to a hotel we were stuck i didn't know where we  were in the middle of nowhere we were in like montana the grand tetons we're at we're in the  middle of nowhere it was horrible that guy was fucking so close to it it's to to getting in my  bone yeah yeah it's a lot of action what a trooper you are though after a little asshole tickling you  still turned over for a minute if you would have just like perched your ass up a little bit 
[02:03:30]  see we would have had a situation he'd have slid a digit in there yeah he definitely was suspect  i just remember you think jeez wow colombo you think that he's rubbing your legs in a hot tub  naked naked oh everyone was my wife that was the weird part she called him out though good for her  it's a great story yes good for her and i didn't you're weird like you do i punch him out is he really 
[02:04:00]  just trying to sell the massages he trying to get a menage a twat like what's going on like i would  have thought you'd have said something like two what are you doing man i should have i should have  yeah yeah because that isn't even like i think in combative it's kind of like what are you doing  i might you know and that's that's probably where where marijuana can hurt you  everything's cool right that's all cool yeah right this guy's just doing his own thing and right  you know who am i to fucking judge and fuck that now it makes sense that makes sense when that if i 
[02:04:30]  had if i had a drink or two he would have been missing teeth he would have been missing teeth  hey faggot  standing up with my wet nuts what's your problem dog faggot hennig  hey you want to see a magic trick  hey your teeth are about to disappear  hey here's my weenie you want to play hide the baloney

[02:05:30]  yeah he's cool man he's just feeling my wife up you know this is these are my hang-ups  these are my hang-ups i don't need to put them on him he's the cool guy he's the guy that's got it  together i'm fucked up he obviously knows what's going on here there's no reason for rage against doug  fuck that punch him in the face right i should have fucking when did you realize that you checked  in when did you get the first creepy vibe from doug right off the bat right right off wow yeah 
[02:06:00]  i didn't like him from the beginning yeah what did you do that made you not like him was his vibe or  he you know what i was looking like doug henning right off the bat looking like doug henning and  and they were really they were a little too uh hippie slash earthy for me oh he had a girl  he did have a girl but even she was a little suspect a lot of granola before granola was in  and so it was like um you know once when people shake your hand that you do the limp thing that 
[02:06:30]  really bothers me yeah it really like dude shake my hand you think he would have popped your cock  in his mouth though if you were let him i think i i think i would have had a situation i think he  would have let me dirty his hair he would have eaten your ass on that table oh jesus dude yeah  oh that's oh man god only knows what shenanigans happens in that house oh yeah he said shenanigans 
[02:07:00]  this morning i almost pulled over i just had laughing so hard oh and he gets the right combination of  people in there dude you're the first one to say no we probably couldn't believe you're right  you're right you're the first one that actually went for the naked massage yeah yeah that didn't  end up with a fucking come in his mouth he let it go oh that guy was counting his fucking chickens  that that day oh god i got a naked massage get fucking i'm dumb i'm jerking off while he massaged  you like you'd probably feel like if you look back this time he's just rubbing you with one hand 
[02:07:30]  he's probably plumping his dick up with the other putting that chlorinated smelling lotion on your back  yeah rub it in deep it's a deep tissue massage i bet he's still close to the table to get his rod  against your knuckle because my hot stone first i dip it in the hot lava and then i rub it on your  back yeah you like that massage he definitely has a history that's great yeah you don't need any

[02:17:00]  trashing veiled no exactly i hate how veiled racism sounds it's phony i like being authentic i like  saying the world veiled yes that is true yeah yeah no no of course i'm very happy for you call  and uh how come no wednesday shows now we'll get to it jesus christ  is that like the theater day off or something no no i don't know it's actually not a bad question

[02:18:00]  anyway this weather we've been having oh let's talk about the weather what a great segue and i  tell you this was the april showers right yeah it's like god pissing on you right oh well i guess  that's one way to look at it fuck you twittered something about you and conan having a beef  and it was this fighting irish family oh yeah the uh the joyces and i wound up watching all these  documentaries on these bare knuckle brawlers in ireland they're pretty fucking interesting man 
[02:18:30]  hilarious yeah yeah all they do is fight over some slightly irish well they know they're tinkers  they're like gypsies and you read the comments and it goes because it was like i'd meet you in  longford now you never showed up joe have it and they just keep arguing and they beat the balls of  each other really but then the comments you can tell they're the most hated people in ireland  because underneath it's like they're useless cunts hitler was right about killing gypsies you should  kill every fucking one they do nothing they add nothing to society and it's like all these great 
[02:19:00]  comments but just kind of like irish written so well but just like a combination of cursing and  like literate just trash really everybody hates their guts so they hate each other and everybody  hates them everybody hates them why do they like why are they doing this no they've been doing that  for hundreds of years to settle inter-family beefs they have two guys you know the joyce mcquinn mcdonough  and there's all these different families and they just have these they have these big beefs and some  of them are really funny guys you know but you can barely understand them what is that about why 
[02:19:30]  do they hate each other and a lot of them honestly a lot of them and i'm not just saying this to to be  inclusive to our uh to fill in for opie today but a lot of them do look like scorch  yes do they yeah facially they come facially look i'm like there's just something about them yeah  one guy was talking about how he keeps his fucking hands hard he goes i soaked him in joe joyce joe joy  i soaked him in petrol for 20 minutes a day yeah he's soaked his hands in gas for 20 minutes a day 
[02:20:00]  it's not even gas petrol you know it's like eastern european knockoff shit probably yeah very low octane  very high in fucking additives that's a fight his wife must have hated when his big fucking hard  rock hands went into her pussy oh just burns her pussy yeah they don't they don't finger each other  in ireland they just have regular sex regular missionary position to have kids yeah i remember  a friend of mine as a little kid went to ireland and he was like 10 to visit his relatives and he came 
[02:20:30]  back and told us how he had to have these fights with all these little kids from this trailer and he  started describing tinkers but we didn't know what it was you know what i mean oh shit so it's like  one of those things they eat like hey yank come on yank and they made a fight every day  and it was the same thing what a vacation just getting fucking the shit beat out of you that  sounds horrible he was a wild kid anyway so was he oh okay it does seem like if you go to ireland  you're probably going to get in a fight because they like to mix it up if you're in the bar the  whole time obviously something's going to happen like the donny brook i always see every footage 
[02:21:00]  of piece of footage ireland i see it's fucking dismal out the weather is cloudy i have zero desire  like today yeah here in our own oh yes well i'm surprised that jim is like a sunny day enthusiast  he's like i don't want to go to that dismal weather yeah jim is he smiles when he sees sunshine  he's a god i didn't realize he was a fucking brazilian supermodel  i get the doldrums from some of that weather what the fuck is this well i don't you know go out before 
[02:21:30]  it's dark do you no i'm a respectable comedian i just don't care for uh i just don't care for  overcast weather it really dampens my mood i don't blame you yeah people uh they put those  those fucking lights on themselves they look into a fucking light all winter long because they don't  they get seasonal depression i have so they have to look into a light i think i think our own troy  right there he has one yeah and and it's so you your body and your eyes can see some type of what  would be sunlight simulate about all the other shit you worry about just what about pesticides 
[02:22:00]  i'll pour water on my strawberries what is water all over your strawberries only because i knew if i  reached for your coffee which i wanted to do it smashed you would have caught me too early yes i had  to go with what was available to my hands now jim's moving his he's moving his items away from  it well i told you this creep started it many years ago i was trying to have a lovely cup of tea at the  comedy cellar as i like to have and so i go upstairs and i was like oh they gave me mint tea instead of 
[02:22:30]  regular tea you know i fucking i don't like mint tea turns to turns out to be they gave me regular  tea it was not the staff's fault i want to emphasize that this asshole was chewing gum and stuck  his gum in my fucking tea i was drinking his goddamn gum his gum juice  holy shit you thought it was mint tea i was like oh mint tea i don't like this mint tea he's sitting 
[02:23:00]  there smirking at the table so ever since then anytime he's at the table i got you twice yeah and  that was 10 years ago yeah and ever since then literally if he's at the table even all these years  later you think somebody's mature adults i carry my tea any drinking any beverage i have i carry them  down well you should yes he's gonna fucking pervert it in some fashion wow  were you grossed out with the thought you know no just one of those things it was just infuriating  it's in his mouth and you know no anthony you know what it is you just we you like certain 
[02:23:30]  comforts that's all i'm saying what can we look forward to in uh your unconstitutional  well you're the only one who really understands what i'm trying to achieve i love it oh i know  what you're trying to achieve i know you don't maybe you meant me what's that maybe you meant  that i'm the only one who understands no i meant anthony's the only horse what do you think he's  trying to achieve let's take let's do a test what is he trying to achieve trying to achieve he is  trying to uh rid the world of this ignorance and revisionist history that is going on and using humor 
[02:24:00]  to get these points across instead of the doldrums of c-span thanks thank you of course what do you  think jim's very trying to do some fucking fun jokes oh that's i told you about that idiot voice  that time back in the early 90s i know i've said this before i'll say it again until the whole country  understands voice it just hated me because all these guys knew i was funny and voice didn't get  and he would get so one time i was on stage at carolines and i did something but it was like almost  like i go this is like a poem but it was like a comedy but it wasn't a poem you know it was jokes 
[02:24:30]  yeah but it didn't work he comes up right after me this is 1994 goes i i don't we didn't know each  other barely just a little bit hey i don't do poems i do fucking jokes folks oh oh shit just sold  me out did you fucking hate him right then and there i was like who is this god this asshole  fucking mullet that bastard a rat tail he had a rat tail yeah rat tail well rat tails were big in 94 
[02:25:00]  yeah well maybe not big but they were what the fuck why would he say that son of a bitch especially  not knowing you yeah i mean he knew me a little bit but you know not that not that well just because  he was feeling his oats he was in carolines you know it was like it was like voice is the one that  broke it open in many ways for norton and the rest of the jersey hacks to actually work in new york  jersey hacks in that sense you have to give credit you know what i mean yeah bring him the jersey  hacks yeah i think voss got there first we went around the same time though yeah no i remembered 
[02:25:30]  very vividly it was voss voss lewis loved voss he did voss probably got you in but i used to go to  the comic strip and me you franchisee florentine and eric mcmahon would go out right um to eat at  that place across the street from the strip that's fucking like 1995 jeez million years ago right  million years ago guys you used to call me naughty norton oh hello naughty yeah that was you in front  you were naughty i was a naughty boy he was a naughty boy yeah and you lived with uh jim at the time 
[02:26:00]  i think that's before i lived with jim i spoke to battling bob lee i i'm walking on 46 here's the  problem with the world i'm walking on 46th street yesterday going to an important publicity lunch at joe allen  top trendy restaurant with the ap and i passed this theater on 46th street you know there's a bunch  of shows over there like and i look and it says appearing only tonight in one of the theater shows  bob the reverend bob levy wow so i took a picture and sent it out so the public knew what was going on 
[02:26:30]  on the broadway for one night on a great white way bob levy he's like a broadway name now yeah right  wow for one night only uh carl i gotta ask you um what do you what's your take on uh uh the  constitution in this day and age a lot of people saying uh it's being trotted upon well that's that's  i really i honestly i i feel like uh i feel like we should be having more constitutional conventions 
[02:27:00]  so that people can really discuss this kind of thing i feel like it's not a serious discussion  it's not just everybody putting their everybody's just saying this this this picking and choosing  everyone's like yes you need to have a serious conversation and they're well let's face it the  only thing you care about is the gut is the second well i kind of like the first too no you care about  the second i like the second but why do you care about the first well that's what i do it's kind of  my job who's trotting on the first amendment uh there are a lot of things uh that uh trot on my  first amendment rights especially um political correctness more so than oh infuriating to to 
[02:27:30]  to not have the ability i i will absolutely to not have the ability to address especially racial  issues in this country without having the scarlet r put on your chest is a fucking embarrassment i'm  tired of black people being called racist for addressing white issues i agree with you oh  unbelievable it really is infuriating i would really like to have more of a uh freedom  to say things and have an open dialogue because nothing gets accomplished unless you can  really hash it out like that but they're so afraid to just have an open discussion about 
[02:28:00]  race in this yes well let's actually address very deeply in the show good i got it's almost like  you're quoting the show in many ways wow do you address the fact with the uh i was actually going  to use scarlet r i have it written down but now i'm afraid because are here or not call because i  feel like i the scarlet letter don't even feel instead of an a it's an r don't even feel that  way you take it yeah oh somebody's uh doing a little weedy on the old stem master 
[02:28:30]  now do you mention the fact that in the constitution everybody complains like like uh when you mentioned  the guns right and you say something about well that you know when the constitution was drafted they  didn't have fucking ar-15s or whatever it is they have it was a different time well i certainly  don't want to mention that because that would be you know and they say well different time they still  meant the same thing but if you say how can you listen to people who wrote the constitution because  they had slaves they're talking about freedom these same people go that was a different time you have 
[02:29:00]  to allow that yeah that's a good point i uh i see it as uh there are certain things that um you have  to look at um when when they were when they were keeping rights from people that is what is considered  wrong when they're when they're uh respecting rights because rights aren't given they're just they're  there they're your god-given rights and when they're respecting those rights that's a good thing so with  the second amendment uh they're respecting your right to bear arms as of being slave owners they are uh taking 
[02:29:30]  away someone's rights so you can make that distinction jim they're not the same thing that you're really  talking about but it's the overall point and the view of how we say that was the times well so we  throw the entire document away because they were slave owners is that uh is that smart i'm eating  strawberry he's got a very constitutional mustache made out of a napkin call you're looking very  very come on very constitutional the constitution yeah but that's this little argue this little 
[02:30:00]  whatever this was here is exactly why the show now it's more important now than than ever  if you see one show now i only mean five weeks right because despite jim's plans for me to tour  all over the goddamn right he has you everywhere this thing i've been doing in a year right five  weeks and i want to fucking make some goddamn money get the fuck out well i want to go see it and  you know i have to i have to make one more comment about that because a lot of people do bring up the 
[02:30:30]  well it was muskets back then they would never you know have it with assault rifles and whatnot  do you think when they wrote the second amendment and uh said you have the right to bear arms  that they weren't talking about the absolute top of the line weaponry of their day the musket  they didn't say well you have the right to bear this it's not as good as our amazing assault musket  but so as time went on you you got better weaponry and during the course of their own lives they saw 
[02:31:00]  weaponry advance uh uh leaps and bounds you didn't you thought they thought it was just going to stop  right there they knew it was going to advance i i firstly i don't think they saw the degenerate the  way society would degenerate at the school shootings i don't believe they saw that coming they've seen  all over the globe but regardless of what they thought at that point this is where we are now right  and we have to look at things and how they're affecting us now and the point i'm making is  simply people are and this is all of us are selective when they look at something like well 
[02:31:30]  that was the times like we say that at certain times when it suits the argument but to say that  that was the times when they wrote about muskets it's like well they meant it to continue well then  given given that that's what the times was so we can move along well that's anyway times that's all  he wants that really is all i want is that all he wants you to do is go hey you know what that's  an interesting point and we can fucking move along what an interesting point and i i i gotta agree  this is not about this is about states rights versus federal rights thank you yes that's what i'm 
[02:32:00]  trying to say yes and the show covers it don't worry about okay good i'm sitting here going guys just  come to see the show then you can really make yes yes and you'll be informed oh you'll be totally  informed yeah i i don't like new york states rights i don't like what they've done with the  second amendment as far as that goes but well overstepped their bounds but it is their stupid  right it's their right well well it's the people they're right the state's rights are limited by  the constitution right so i think they're overstepping their boundaries and in some respects 
[02:32:30]  as far as the second amendment goes i really do second you mean uh and bloomberg yeah and i think  also that they're uh they're putting legislation in place that does nothing that whole that when they  said when cuomo wrote into law that uh you have to have a magazine with seven rounds capacity  seven rounds seven bullets didn't he do enough research to know that they don't make seven round  mags for uh ar-15s and for a lot of handguns and stuff that there's only a five and then a ten round 
[02:33:00]  magazine so then they're like okay we we fucked that up we didn't even know about magazines when we  wrote a law fucking law about what's that more unforgettable appearances from the biggest names  in comedy coming up this big world this big round globe is theater in the round to me i'm just here  for the show a very chippers and thanksgiving will continue on the opian anthony channel  may of last year cruise immediately took over with our serious xm listeners on the highway  the highway was the first to play florida georgia line we love you thank you for believing in us

[02:37:30]  here's your host lyle chick chipperson this segment is chris herdwock  talking about the nerdast the podcast and tv show and him and jim narden talk about cheese  and with other things i was on tv i'm a ghost back to you chris yes sir we're talking about podcasts 
[02:38:00]  yes sir talking about walking dead what else is going on in your world we do the nerdist tv show  for bbc america yeah when did that start that started well that started in 2011 we did a handful  of specials and then and then now it's on for you know for for 10 weeks and it's sort of an expanded  version of the podcast but it's fun i don't like having uh guys like you in because it just makes me  more frustrated with this with the with how awful this place is how did but how did you turn the 
[02:38:30]  podcast what did you what you didn't wait for somebody else to do what did you do that's our  idea we're like look we do so much visual stuff we could easily get a half hour a week an hour a week  yeah and it doesn't have to be on some massive over-the-top network either well i for us it was um i'm a  huge doctor who fan and so that's how i you mean mfawesome says the guy who follows uh chess matches  uh fair enough uh i have things in my life but uh and which by the way i support i played tournament 
[02:39:00]  chess did you that's right we thought we had this great conversation about because i never knew  you were like oh my god and we started talking about casparov and all these matches magnus carlson  has agreed to play me how why do you play regularly i'm lying okay i just i wanted to add something no i  just play for i remember i remember when i shot the when i shot the comedy special we went uh the after  party was on this street and which i'd never been on before and we go down the street and there's all  these 24-hour chess the chess forum one of them just clubbed guessing it's in the village and it 
[02:39:30]  was like on uh thompson or something like that one of those streets yeah i was trying to figure out  like how do these places stay open you basically pay pay like five bucks an hour or something to sit  down and play but what keeps are they just been open for so long that do they they own the buildings  or what's what do you think the deal is well one of them closed and i'm guessing online chess has  hurt a lot did you used to go in there no i never played in those places i would always play at the  cellar with keith or uh right those guys but uh i'm guessing it was just it's a community thing  but now with online chess you can stay home and play and smoke indoors yeah i forgot that you were 
[02:40:00]  a big uh chess guy growing up yeah i love it you you were really good though i was very i was pretty  good but but i can't play anymore because it just it's too it hurts my head now you play chess with  friends no because i'm not uh i don't i can't do it recreationally because i've so much of my  young life i was trained to like you know where you're basically trying to fry the board with  laser eyes you know like it just did your instructor ever knock all the pieces off so you could see it 
[02:40:30]  better no like in searching for bobby fisher no and throw the rook at your head like the rutgers  coach call you a faggot do you did you remember the old snl sketch with jim belushi where he was  like the bobby knight style chess coach yeah knight to rook for what are you doing that's funny um so  anyway so i pitched the bbc show i'm a huge doctor who fan i got to know the bbc folks and they said  do you want to do a show and i said yeah i want to do like a tv version of the podcast very cool so  it's like it's more it's not like if there aren't like cameras in a studio it's like a radio studio 
[02:41:00]  it's it feels like a chat show right now is there an audience there yeah there's an audience that's  great though man i mean how long is it it's an hour shows an hour on the bbc so it's saturday night  so it's doctor who and then another show called orphan black that's a sci-fi show and then uh and  then our show the nerdist at 10 i got one uh just one chess uh question so we we all kind of grew up  playing chess but what was it that someone saw in you where they're like whoa you got you got a talent  here and you we you should explore that it was me you just knew well it was me just loving the game 
[02:41:30]  so much and my school um i just happened to be lucky enough to have a school that had the head of  the math department also was the computer lab and he was also the chess coach and so right in that room  if for they and so he allowed he basically set the table for us to we'd play chess before school  during lunch and after school and then in between you'd screw around on the computers it was this bank  of apple 2e computers and um you know so that that's where a lot of it that's where a lot of it's uh 
[02:42:00]  i belong to the ratings on the wall every day they'd print out the ratings the the uscf ratings and  i uh i belong to a secret chess club and uh we were a very secret society but we would greet each other  by seeing each other and going checkmate why don't you uh why don't you tell kate that when  she was in here because that's all i need is damp panties all over the studio oh chess boy  you think she was interested at all she couldn't she literally couldn't if i picked a scab and held 
[02:42:30]  it up to her she could would couldn't have been less interested to me well nothing to do with me  you know if you had met under different circumstances but yes like like me with a ski mask and a gun  tied up somewhere i mean it's gotta it's gotta be it's gotta be really uh it's gotta be really  intimidating to come into a room of dudes where everyone's talking real fast and there's a lot  of testosterone and excellent way to put it that's why i like chris because what you should have said  is it must be really uncomfortable to come in where guys are talking and the one with gray hair and the  misshapen head hits on you it's a really nice way to fucking phrase that thank you my friend 
[02:43:00]  of course i do enjoy chess though i love love love fucking chess play like great chess players like uh  you know i want to meet these because they're playing i think uh magnus cross is playing  viswanathan anon like and i really am interested in how that turns out for the championship  and uh i'm just dying to to be at that match god you i'm telling you man it you you should do some 
[02:43:30]  type of a thing with it yeah but i'm not a good enough player like i literally am a very average  player but because i'm average at it like i i i respect what the i'm fascinated by those guys like i  would love to talk to any of them for a great length and it would probably bore the audience i would  just ask stupid questions i wonder if a lot of them would really be good in conversation  no they're probably good when talking to chess people who can talk about well explain your  opening there well for me i would just go so did you know when the horse jumped the night were you 
[02:44:00]  happy that's the same piece oh i'm sorry but you know that you know the game i'd rather just talk  about bobby fisher yeah yeah so did you agree with what he said about jews go um i don't know why  do you ask me these things yeah then they're winking yes yes any americans good at chess  oh i guess it was i mean uh besides him yeah there's some i'm sure i mean there were not many  though is my point right they're russian russian because it's a culture of chess there yeah and 
[02:44:30]  carlson is from like scandinavia or sweden or something uh or norway he's from some nordic  fucking country america like the other countries will take kids where they notice an aptitude for  something and make them you know like they will exploit those in terms of musicianship or sport you know  or like uh like like ballet or something like and or chess and in america it's basically like  pageants you know like that pageants are what are america it's sort of what they do with their sad 
[02:45:00]  yeah it really have uh the first black grandmaster i believe is uh american uh look him up this i  don't know his name but uh he say any name right now i think did you see uh brooklyn castle  that documentary last year i did not know but i remember that yeah it's very good it's about  uh a group of kids from a brooklyn chess team right right right i want to get them in to interview  them actually uh who's who's uh maurice ashley yes the first black gm you know something about  chess they're just googling no i just like uh good documentaries and that was i love it love a good 
[02:45:30]  documentary brooklyn castle speaking of which uh vice is on tonight let's not forget give those guys  vice is on tonight shane smith's uh show love those guys from hbo vice on hbo it's gonna yeah  i haven't seen it yet but i know the show yeah it's gonna be fun it's tremendous it's gonna be  good he saw the first uh two first two and they showed part of the korea episode which was oddly  moving like because it wasn't all about rodman because there was a couple of the globetrotters  there and they were showing some of the game but then they're showing the globetrotters interact 
[02:46:00]  with these kids these north korean children and uh it was really amazing to watch these kids  being uh just spinning the basketball on their finger the glow you know the little trick they  would do they've never seen anything like that like american kids see that shit on tv all the time  they'd never seen it to watch them reacting to it was really moving it was great wow these guys are  fucking tremendous they were all there too at the premiere shane was there fucking sarush all of them  the whole fucking and the one guy was telling us about getting drunk with kim jong-un it was very  interesting and then shane's teasing that one line was it in afghanistan the borderline 
[02:46:30]  oh no pakistan india pakistan the uh the border the uh in cashier he went right up to the line  he was kind of fooling around with a little bit it was great and basically if you go over the line  they will shoot you they said that they will if you walk into pakistan if you take one step over  the line of pakistan they'll shoot you and they mean it they're not saying nothing went right up to  the line just kind of tiptoed around this is not a cuba fucking u.s guantanamo thing where they're  not actually going to shoot you if you put one foot over you know i mean if you ran in they might but 
[02:47:00]  you put one foot over the line in cuba they're not going to shoot an american but uh i'm in fucking  in pakistan india you put one foot over the line they'll they'll shoot you dead yeah i know i'm  saying that like an authority figure they're never i'm repeating what i heard but with fervor and  they're never going to figure that one out no they hate each other yeah it's hindus and muslims  yeah they're not going to figure that one out oh you know what do i know yeah i just want to know  the carlson anand anand match it's all i care about you look it up when is it if i can get tickets  tell roll in the book then thanks so chris when are you sleeping if you got all these projects i 
[02:47:30]  don't sleep very often i sleep on planes really that's the like i can't sleep on planes at all  i don't have a problem sleeping on planes i even fall asleep while you're getting blown that's  happened to me a few times jesus really for real getting blown is that where yes oh a mouth bath yeah  are you kidding though no i've been very tired i've been very tired you know jim you're you're  fascinating to me because i think you should do a political show or something you know it's because 
[02:48:00]  you like you know the girls come in and you sort of make like i'm gonna i'm gonna put a ski mask  on and you make these but you've you have so much insight into things i really think you should  do some kind of political something or i don't know thank you nobody agrees with you i i agree with  you but nobody agrees with you you're a fucking smart guy you should really you could fucking  take over wheeze says he likes uh talking politics with you one of my uber liberal friends you know i  wheeze is a real liberal he's not a fake he is all in liberal yeah but he's a he's a guy really 
[02:48:30]  he's a liberal who just did time in vietnam served two tours and fucking hates the government doesn't  trust him like that to me is what a fucking you know he's a denim jacket wearing liberal he's not  like one of these guys who wants you fired if you don't hyphenate properly or but he always likes  talking politics with you well you know you give him a good you give him a good run and i'm well  i'm reasonable i don't disagree with him so well you know are you on the road a lot oh god is he i  am but not as i just shot an hour so like i'm back now for a while i got a few dates i actually got 
[02:49:00]  caroline's next week um and then i buy your stretch factory a few things local you know baltimore and  then just i'm done with the act for a while it's like you wanted to start over sure sure yeah that's  where i am because my my special aired in november so now i'm building the new which is the best  it's fun it's a fun product i never the weird thing about this is i shot the special normally  once the special is shot i have no more fucking road work and it's goodbye material and right to  the comedy cellar um but now i still have i'm going to probably work up until july once the special airs 
[02:49:30]  i will not be doing the material anymore you can't i found what's interesting is that when i did the first  when i did the special last year it basically was born out of a bunch of shorter sets that were  stitched together but now that i'm forming the set on the road in as that when i go when i've gone  and like tried to do guest sets 10 minute guest sets i'm i fucking struggle because i'm like oh god  i don't know this one bit needs this other bit next to it to contextualize it and it's sort of  hard to because i'm not just like joke joke joke joke joke joke so it's been sort of weird but 
[02:50:00]  it's great like to do the hour is great but it is hard when you walk into a place they want you to  all right we'll do a couple minutes and it's like all right well my opening joke i can't do that  because i fucking say continent my next joke is racial i can't do that like they think that they  just do a couple of minutes because you have to you sort of have to let the audience get to know  you a little bit before you before you go deeper so that they're like okay they're already on board  they know you're not threatening they know that you know so it's sort of uh yeah some guy in la was  like oh i'm starting up the show do you want to come do seven minutes and i felt like a dick i was 
[02:50:30]  like i don't know if i know how to do seven minutes anymore because i don't have just like like eight  jokes for seven minutes said and he had a shot i had to do i did live at gotham last night and  chris didn't care it was really the owner of gotham he was doing older stuff whatever because  i couldn't do anything i just shot because if i aired something live on tv before and out of my  special they would have fucking decapitated me yeah of course so uh i'm going through a lot of  material which was fun to do because i haven't done something in a while and something i've never  done on tv and there was one new bit that's just not going to stay in the special that i did  and uh it was weird to have to time it because you know it's live television so the guys wrap up 
[02:51:00]  wrapping up and he's like you better fucking finish quickly at one point just look at the  crowd i'm like ah look at these girls all right be right back did you really yeah because i knew  like i would rather just go out like just saying something silly that's funny in the middle of a  joke and you fuck you can't fuck with the advertisers right you know you just can't yeah we we don't  fuck with the advertisers ever i think that's the beauty of not having any you know there's nothing  to lose we risk losing no one we can't offend our advertisers chris hardwick is at carolines this 
[02:51:30]  weekend and of course it's nerdist on twitter it's the nerds podcast it's nerds.com it's the bbc show  it's unbelievable yeah because chris is a fucking doer i respect that honestly i mean i really mean  that it's fucking good you you you do you do shit and that's respect i appreciate i think it was just  like as before the majority of my career i wasn't doing anything and then and then you get to a  certain point you're like if i don't start doing stuff now it's not gonna happen right and they  and no one just lets just get comes in and goes here have this thing no they don't and it's we all 
[02:52:00]  wait for that magic day where someday i'll wake up and the call will come jim everything's in line  you just have to show up the network's all called they get it just never gonna happen they just have  to show up they knew you were sleeping in it will never happen and the podcast is always uh in the top  10 if not even i mean it's it's like one and one or two on a lot of weeks too there we've been yeah  we've been pretty fortunate about it's been it's just fun i just i just like doing the stuff that i 
[02:52:30]  do that's i think that's the best thing is that if you like what you're doing it's all everything's  gravy do you do it by yourself like bill burr do you have guests um well i have we have there  are two co-hosts who are on a lot of the episodes but not all of them because i just some a lot  of my travel or they're working or whatever on other stuff and so but we we have guests and then  we have episodes where it's just the three hosts oh cool uh that we call hostful episodes and those  usually go up about once a week good for you man and we just did a stand-up special too we did a  stand-up special at our space at meltdown which meltdown meltdown's a comic book store in la and we 
[02:53:00]  have a little theater space at the back so we do shows seven nights a week and so we did i did a  stand-up we do a stand-up special once a year so we're putting that up so that's great man yeah  see we need a spot like that somewhere in new york city we need just our little joint you need a live  spot to do we have we talk about a lot of stuff all of us nothing but we don't do it  dude seriously i'm telling you having a little clubhouse was so great for us and ours is in a  comic book store and it's a really great environment and the store is huge and it's kind of a legendary  store and a lot of our podcasts we have a space upstairs and a lot of our podcasts record there 
[02:53:30]  it's really it's fun so yeah you guys should just have a live space we won't come hang out you go do  live shows and no here's what we do we complain on the air and complain to each other and we mean it  we're genuinely being honest with each other and then we just go our separate ways and all do nothing  about i gotta tell you something though but we're also under contract and these guys just don't feel like  listening to i've had i've i gotta defend us a little bit i've had a shitload of meetings with  scott greenstein on a lot of this stuff and it's a lot of yeah yeah yeah yeah and nothing ever  fucking we don't make it happen i say we because i'm as late i believe me i i am emotionally at times 
[02:54:00]  very bad with this shit i i know what i have to do and i don't do it what's very hard and what i  don't understand how you do is doing a morning radio show is so emotionally taxing and exhausting i  don't know how you do get up super early in the morning and then still go perform at night because  i find that if in both fields you level off at mediocrity it removes all pressure i can wake  up tired and be blah i can go on stage tired and it's blah that's all it is constant mediocre i have 
[02:54:30]  a final question because you just brought up something why is doing morning radio so taxing you  did you you you've been in this radio game a while now because we only work four or five hours you  do technically but is it is it mentally just exhausting well for me i remember you know i  remember getting up at like three o'clock in the morning you'd get beat to work by 4 30 you'd have  to do show prep so you know we were on the air at i don't know 5 30 maybe or six or something and  then it you definitely you do the four hour show but you're constantly mentally engaged the whole 
[02:55:00]  time because you're looking at the clock how long okay we got this we're talking to that guy  we're going to this break go to the song then after that there's the post show then you kind  of got a plan and then throughout the day you're like oh what are we going to do for the show  tomorrow then so it's really it's really like a 12 hour job right and and your day ends at like  three in the afternoon and then you're exhausted and then you have time to do other stuff and then  that i bailed on it being a 12 hour a day job it's not even a job for us but it was for many years  but i finally had to like say no man mentally it's killing me it's it's it's people work way the 
[02:55:30]  fuck harder than us but i go home exhausted a lot i would challenge i mean yes it's not you  know this stuff it's it's it's not like uh uh you know construction or building a railroad or like  it's not work with your hands but you know you challenge someone to be super focused and mentally  engaged for like five hours straight and they're gonna be tired your brain gets fucking tired right  in the real world you're lucky to get someone to pay attention to you for 15 seconds i mean you  have to have that ridiculous focus for four or five hours a day yeah where you really are paying 
[02:56:00]  attention to everything for five hours or else it's fucked yeah it goes off the rails right on well  chris it's always a pleasure thanks guys good to see you don't go motherfuckers chip's guided tour  through the ona archives continues with more unforgettable ona appearances by the world's top  comics coming up this show got me in trouble of course it did this is a very chipperson  thanksgiving what's that on the op and anthony channel  east side dave mcdonald smashes face first into the space between sports and pop culture

[03:07:30]  yeah i see you a little jig in my jag i see when there's other people around i think you're on a  pogo stick that's how much bounce that's how much bounce you have in your step please rich  come on what you're not even trying you're just being like i am trying no you're not i am like  i have my house all right let's get it together so i think because i called you it said you had a 
[03:08:00]  reputation for being hot-headed you're now trying to be the opposite that it's so dumb  take your gum out what brought that up oh we because you wanted to write an email back to  somebody who whatever that we're getting paid for something and yeah and they're delaying we did a  favor a big favor i mean it's not it's a little thing is it a favor we did a pilot we did a pilot but 
[03:08:30]  it's a favor because the money we did it for it's not a favor if it gets picked up then it works to  our benefit but the fact that we went in for such low money i mean bonnie and i were a brand you know  we we get we're a brand you know just like duck dynasties a brand the housewives are a brand you  know we are a brand there's no one like us there's no one there's no one that could say to their wife 
[03:09:00]  shut up you're stupid all right and have uh a bunch of females at a uh at a female comedy festival  get upset i'll get okay we'll get to that now so we're a brand so here's the deal we do this pilot  and hopefully it gets picked up everybody we worked with we liked on the pilot the people running the  pilot the people in the pilot uh it was it was a lot of fun but still you know you got to separate fun  with business with business it's not show fun everybody you're not even trying it's show 
[03:09:30]  been it so it's your show been it so hopefully it gets picked up and then we'll be on the tv show  hopefully it gets picked up and they keep bonnie and i on it you know it can get picked up and they  can just cut us loose what if they said just you rich not bonnie i would have to say what day do you  want me to start i would be thrilled uh there's nothing i wouldn't want to do less than a reality  that's what i'm going to say to the judge just me not bonnie so i don't get that i don't know it's 
[03:10:00]  just i i'm just trying to explain things i'll get funny at some point or maybe not try don't try  don't try to be funny just let your personality come through that's how it works so anyhow the payment  we we taped this how long ago do you think we taped it i don't know a month month and a half  month and a half ago and you know it's it's small money but it's just the fact that i you know the 
[03:10:30]  money i get and the money bonnie gets it's just it's found money now so they put us through a you  know all of a sudden now they send us paperwork which we didn't do paperwork the last you know this  our second uh shoot with them okay once again you don't have to go through every detail they're  taking a long time with payment this is how you tell the story they're taking a long time with  payment holding up uh for various reasons and you wanted to send off uh email yeah being angry and i 
[03:11:00]  said don't be defensive not being angry saying did you write the email that i told you to write  first of all the email i want it's like hey we did you guys a favor why why would you make us wait  that doesn't come off and before and before all that too before all that you know uh the people  doing this have a lot of money and i know but it doesn't matter they're gonna pay us yeah they're  gonna pay us of course you don't need the money tomorrow i don't need it at all i don't need it 
[03:11:30]  it's principle she you with your canadian upbringing i i don't want to i don't want to have a fight  all the time it's not a fight when you say to somebody hey why are you taking advantage of  why are you fucking me after i helped you after i did something nice after i then you should call  the guy and ask him point blank yeah after i after we both he'll say i'm not fucking you i'm paying you  i just have to do this paperwork first and you know what but they would know that you know they're 
[03:12:00]  fucking you after you do them a favor and i'm tired i don't i don't let people if you let people  take advantage of the thing is that you want to be right they don't see this i'm not right no i know  but you want at the end of the day for them to be like oh you know what we are fucking rich you're  right let's not do it they won't it'll never happen okay at the end of the day but guess what  it might not happen the second time it might not happen down the road of course it will that's how  they get to be rich businessmen no not to me it might not happen down the road because they just 
[03:12:30]  won't use you for anything or if they do use me and and and then i put stipulate oh rich is a  problem no and then i put stipulate you know what they use if you're talented and they want you  you're arguing to me like you're right you're right okay you're right but but i'm saying writing  an email that's defensive and angry not defensive that's aggressive it's not defensive it's aggressive  either way that's that you know that's how they're gonna take it either way it won't help 
[03:13:00]  anything except for send bad because you know what but then in whatever you're saying in life  if ever no but i'm saying over that amount of money it's not worth it yes if it was a lot of money  or it was a bigger deal but principal you're saying in life if you ever fight back back or if you ever  stand up for yourself no i'm not it's not worth it that's not true i'm saying there are gray areas  there's gray areas in everything there's gray areas in war there's gray areas in business there's 
[03:13:30]  gray areas in buying and selling there's great yeah okay yes i agree there's gray areas so but you  have to at some point in life you got to say you know what this is where i am at in the business this  is who i am whether i get further whether i get lower i'm a i'm you know a person i'm a human don't  fucking treat me like a juice fan i said i said send the email that says we'd appreciate it if you  put it in the mail tomorrow yeah because he said it's going to take a week or whatever over a week 
[03:14:00]  so i said instead of sending in instead of putting all that defensiveness into the email you just write  what you want that's all you do that way you don't start a fight he never got back to me well  but at least he's not arguing back but i'm not trying to start i'm trying to make a point i know  but he doesn't think he doesn't make saying put it in the that's saying like i have respect for  myself i think you should put it in the mail tomorrow and it's not saying like hey we did  you a favor because then he could be like fuck you we did you a favor but put you in a pilot no no 
[03:14:30]  no i'm not saying that's right i'm saying that's what they'll say you will not change anybody's  mind by arguing and being defensive you won't i'm not you're right you can't change people you  can't you try all the time no i i don't try to change them i try to change their outlook on me  they won't they'll change your outlook on you they'll just be like he's a problem we don't want  to deal with him anymore then they don't deal with me because i don't want to deal with somebody  that's going to fuck me why would i want to deal with i'm involved in that too would you want to 
[03:15:00]  deal down if this is how they start i didn't want to do the pilot from the jump if anybody starts  off a relationship like this why would you want to deal with them without setting without setting  a precedent i'm saying rich you don't know what's coming in life i know you don't know where it's  headed and you don't know who he talks to and so why bother over that it's not going to do the  amount of good that it does is not worth it that's all i'm saying but see the same thing as you saying  send him an email we'd appreciate it that's so passive aggressive it's not passive aggressive it's 
[03:15:30]  just completely the fact we'd appreciate it to put in the mail tomorrow then there's nothing on  either there's no like then it's like oh okay they'd like it if we get put in the mail tomorrow  but when you start putting like conditions like hey we did you a favor all this stuff that's where  they can argue i don't say we do your favor say look we did this over a month and a half ago okay  but here's the thing that's where it gets like oh my god this guy is angry but they you know their 
[03:16:00]  last email was oh two weeks ago we'll we'll send it out and then they come back with this  no they're wrong they're wrong i can't impart to you enough you're right but being right doesn't  always mean that it's in your benefit to point that out no it usually is not in your benefit it  usually works against you but so then don't but but guess what guess what guess what so let it go 
[03:16:30]  you have to learn to let some things go also too you have to learn you have to realize i gotta live  with me i got it i'm in my so so it can't be easy i mean uh well so you know what if if if if if i  don't respect myself and oh come are you kidding me right now that is such bullshit you're not going  to respect yourself because you're not going to send an angry email because your check is two  weeks late come on rich it's not about i get it oh i can't even look at myself in the mirror i let 
[03:17:00]  them i let them send that check 15 days after i said i would accept it why i i can't sleep at night  i mean come on no first of all come on i'm saying i'm saying two mondays went by and i didn't say  anything oh what kind of am i a man or a mouse you could be a you could be a strong mouse uh 
[03:17:30]  it's just disrespectful i don't like to be disrespected so what so learn you're in the wrong  business then get out of the business no anything you chose in a business where you know either do  your hair stop do something with your hair i want to go get a hairband but i can't um my point is this  you you've got to learn to let things go or get out of this business no yes no no okay any business  doing what you're doing and having the same results well first of all don't try to say hey first of all 
[03:18:00]  and then you said i have a reputation for being uh a hot a hothead now i don't have a reputation  whatsoever for being a hot you can't say i have a reputation for being mean or being dirty and  out throwing in hothead i never i don't have a hothead people put it all under the same umbrella he's  typical he's a i bet you if you ask people they yeah he's a hothead you get mad that's enough for 
[03:18:30]  people where do i get mad what are you talking about you just had an entire discussion about you  getting mad about a check that's two weeks i didn't say i was mad i said i was oh what did you  say disrespected oh okay oh i can't get move on next next thing oh now you want to go  no because i can't because you know why you're like you you're i i i don't know what you call it  but the way that you live is like in this little teeny tiny box and god forbid somebody say one 
[03:19:00]  word out of it you're like no no it's like you just don't have any well how do you make up these  scenarios i live in this team no whatever i live in a real world where i don't let people walk all  over me that's okay well that's all welcome to being a hothead well yeah i'm not a hothead  you're so focused on being right you can't ever like no i'm not focused on always being right i'm  sometimes focused on on what where's it getting you this conversation what's it buying you does it 
[03:19:30]  feel good no this conversation between us yes no we're both making our points you turn everything  into an argument this is an argument this is two people making different points okay you can't i don't  see what your point is that you're going to keep getting mad at people but you're not a hothead  whoa whoa whoa my point is that i don't like people to take advantage of me that's all  see you take everything but i agree you don't want people to take advantage of you but pick your battles  oh well this was one of my battles i picked well then you should have called them you should have 
[03:20:00]  picked up your phone can you do something about that oh you should have picked up your phone and  called him and said hey dude instead of well i said i said i was going to call him and you said don't  listen when we disagree okay you turn into an argument and an attack on me no i don't because  it's it's you turn it because i don't agree with you and we see things different i that means i live  in a small box but then when am i going to get help no no no look i didn't mean you live in a small 
[03:20:30]  box i'm saying you you're you're the way that you frame everything is so tiny it's not tiny i look at  the big picture no you don't i do no you don't you look at what's going to satisfy your emotions  in the moment that too i look at what's going to yes and i look at and how does this and and how  do you suppose getting mad at xyz guy uh is going to why did you give his name why why is getting mad  at him how does that help you in the big picture like where do you really honestly how do you think 
[03:21:00]  that's going to help you and then we have to move on because honestly this kind of conversation  frustrates the fuck out of people because they're like why can't you see it see now you're saying  that everybody's on your side i'm not saying people are on my side they're just it's like  people that listen to this are thinking you know what he's right i don't like when people take  advantage of me and sometimes every single person listening would say you pick your battles you don't  you don't fight every battle not everyone and especially anybody who's in a business they know 
[03:21:30]  they have to take some shit they have to be disrespected now and again they gotta look at  the big picture they gotta say well how am i instead of being right how am i going to get what i want  okay here let's put it this way this company has disrespected me for for years you should call them  by all means and you shouldn't have worked with them at all no but the fact is that when you called the  guy when they wanted us to do it the second time and whatever the money was low and stuff and you  called him to discuss it you caved in like that no i didn't yes you did and you didn't you didn't 
[03:22:00]  show any of this no and we were like hey please don't disrespect no we were already committed we  were already didn't say to him hey i feel like you're disrespecting me you weren't mature like  that at all we were driving and it's hard to process when things are going that quick now we're getting to  it right now we're getting but in an email to his assistant you can no wasn't his assistant that person  it's not his assistant that's the that email came from the producer the money comes from the  top guy the money comes from yeah the company the money comes from yeah so obviously that guy was 
[03:22:30]  just so you're attacking jews now is that what you're doing you're saying all right let's move on to  let's talk about la the podcast festival that we did in la which i had a great time uh you didn't  want to go who said i didn't want to are you really want to go no i didn't say i didn't want  to go i said is it going to be worth all the money we put out to do it i never once said i don't want 
[03:23:00]  to do this you never heard that come out of my mouth you twist things but i don't want to get in  an argument i all i said you don't aren't i disrespecting you you should say it if i'm  disrespecting you you should definitely no you're misquoting load you're misquoting me there's a  difference between disrespecting and misquoting oh thank you okay so i never said i didn't want  to go uh bonnie set us up she has like you know still has her hipster friends in la and uh the 
[03:23:30]  guy running the podcast festival who's manzini yes one of them from philly said we worked together  years ago i think these guys have great memories you know they remember 20 some years ago he said we  worked together and we got there uh we went to la and uh it was bonnie and i on our own and it was  just uh it was fun the podcast there was all these you know maron was there and doug benson and dana 
[03:24:00]  ghoul and jake johansson jake johansson and uh what's his name uh does the radio show does all  the different characters oh um oh he's uh really funny uh i watched some of his podcasts you did  yeah yeah what the hell is oh uh oh shit i just had his name and it slipped out uh uh anyhow we'll get  back to he does he does a radio show out of la and he does the callers and the host and uh whatever  funny funny cat and who else was there like uh oh uh what's her name uh uh aisha tyler was there 
[03:24:30]  maria bamford you know it was a it was the la podcast scene and the only we had annie kindler on  our podcast well the only two east coast podcasts that were there were uh keith and the girl yeah and us  and uh which you know it was kind of cool you know keith and the girl we went to see their podcast 
[03:25:00]  it was great they did you know there's in the same room we did ours and actually was it wasn't the same  night though was it it was right after ours oh it was it was right after ours uh we had like in the  hotel they had all these different like ballrooms and stuff yeah well we were in a smaller room like  when we we did the opening the two we did the two the two opening podcasts that night  were was mark maron in the big room and us and us and you know our room started off i'm going oh man 
[03:25:30]  there's no one in here you know but it filled up it got packed i mean you could hear the laughter from  from mark maron i kept thinking we were over like we were just getting the overflow for baron's  no but then they told us no his wasn't a hundred percent full no he probably had he probably had  but why would anyone could stop by ours if mark maron was in the other room well because what you  did was you bought a ticket that could get you know either for the night or for the weekend so you 
[03:26:00]  could go see anything that was going on any podcast so his podcast i guess that room he probably i  don't even know what he had because i wasn't in there but let's say 200 150 and then we probably had  about in our room about 60 or 70 right about 60 uh and it was great i mean we've never done we have  we ever done a live podcast where there was an audience no that's our first and when when the 
[03:26:30]  laughter and and and the you know as a comic when you hear laughter it generates energy and then you it's  easier to be funny in front of an audience yeah and then andy kindler sat in who is brilliant i mean  he he's very funny he's just so he's very quick and a lot of people i'm not i shouldn't say this  there's some people that don't get him on you know the east coast uh you can't get any fun 
[03:27:00]  and he's such a comics comic yeah but he's he's just so fucking funny yeah he's great right and  then uh one of bonnie's friends uh jackie casen sat in for like but then she realized she had to go  do a show why are you bringing this stuff up i mean it seems well it was and then they can just  listen to that podcast jake johansson they probably have yeah probably did well i'm saying well i'm just  saying it was and then jake johansson i know but why are you going like you're listing like you're 
[03:27:30]  bullet pointing our last part that's what we're going to do from now on every podcast we do  at some point in the podcast rich is going to bullet point the last podcast is that what i'm  going to do yeah we'll call it uh update last podcast update oh actually that was two podcasts ago  so now you're going to have to also bullet point the last podcast so we did a stand-up show though 
[03:28:00]  also oh well i and here's the deal with the stand-up show like i see the list of stand-up comics on the  show saturday night and my name's not on the list disrespected and i said to one of the guys running  the festival i said uh i mean how do you not have an east coast comic on this show it's all the la  comics i mean wouldn't you want to add a different flavor and i'm not saying i think i have enough 
[03:28:30]  credits and you know history as a stand-up that i should be on this goddamn show  so we go down saturday night to watch a show and the guy running chris said oh so you bullied your  way on the show i go what are you talking about he goes you're on the show which nobody told me  and i didn't really bully my way onto the show i just made an observation the guy who  put the show together said you know i realized dave anthony dave anthony who was a comic in new york 
[03:29:00]  that i worked with said there was no east coast there was no one like him on the show so we put him  on the show but the fact that you had to like be your own manager and yeah well i was i you know  what i did that we both benefited from what i spoke up for myself that's what i did well by the  way i emailed them two weeks prior and said can we be on the comedy show i told you i did speak up  no you asked you said can we be on i i spoke up and said there's a difference you're canadian 
[03:29:30]  asking passive okay okay so i spoke up and and we both got on the show and we i got on the show  because the girl didn't show up that was supposed to be on it well i was just like the last minute  fill in yeah but we it went well we they had two different types of comics that they didn't have  throughout the whole night i mean not saying all the comics they were all different comics they were  all different there was that guy from australia that killed up front uh who else was on it then i 
[03:30:00]  didn't really we don't have to bullet point the whole yeah and then mark mara went on and told a  great story then dana ghoul went on and killed dana ghoul let me tell you is fucking funny it's  always been funny but i worked with dana ghoul when i was getting high 27 years ago i worked with him  and he was so fucking good then this was yeah when he was in boston and i and i worked with him  at in philly when the comedy connection from boston opened in philly uh i worked with dana and he 
[03:30:30]  what this was i was getting high it was 27 and he was fucking great then and he was so funny on this  uh when i first started stand up that he wrote a pilot that had a a bonnie character in it that my  manager told me that he'd seen me on some show and wrote that character for me uh-huh so when i went  to audition for it i thought you know that's i was i was gonna be the only one there and when 
[03:31:00]  i got there there was like 50 girls that sort of you know look like me that were auditioning for my  part and it really threw me and i kept saying to the receptionist like i don't know why she would  care i was like i'm i'm really bonnie i'm really bonnie she was like okay have a seat here's your sides  and then um i went in and blew it i didn't even get a call back i didn't even get a call back for the  bonnie character that story there's so many of those la stories wendy leaveman uh what's his name 
[03:31:30]  lewis black but wendy leaveman did the pilot and then got fired off the pilot of her own show about  her another funny person and then they called sarah silverman to replace her and sarah wouldn't do it  sarah's kind of cool in a lot of ways like she wouldn't uh well yeah but also who wants to play  like then it's called wendy 
[03:32:00]  people it's in every press release wendy originally created for wendy leaveman based on her stand-up now  played by sarah silverman wendy leaveman no one was doing comedy like her no one's ever  she's the one who started that type of comedy right she is uh what do you call it uh legend  not a legend uh you know when somebody you know like a lenny bruce uh carlin uh you know someone who 
[03:32:30]  groundbreaking groundbreaking that's a good one she was groundbreaking she's no one else did that  type of comedy where the punch lines were like we sometimes would play when we were on the road and  we would play wendy leaveman try to write jokes like that right yeah these are all comics i fucking  want to do one of our wendy leaveman jokes i used to love watching her work wendy dana gould these  were and guess what i think wendy's from boston too dana gould from there was a time when boston and 
[03:33:00]  mark maron is from boston too i think well he was there for a while i don't know if he's originally from  there boston had some of the they had the best comics in the country pretty much kenny rogerson  don gavin lenny clark kevin knox uh who passed away may he rest in peace funny uh who else kevin  meanie uh sweeney steve sweeney uh wendy leaving uh steven wright uh leary all bobby kelly or patrice 
[03:33:30]  they're all from fucking boston really billy burr holy shit boston puts out the best fucking comics  who uh there's a documentary about boston comics yeah uh france solomino i think made it  uh he wasn't in that list i just said though uh but was he boston comic he was a boston comic  tony v very funny uh now what is it that makes boston comics well back in the day boston had so many 
[03:34:00]  comedy clubs where you could work out it had played against sam it had nicks it had comedy  connection it had uh uh duck soup there was this there was three clubs on one block there was three  clubs on one there was nicks that would do shows upstairs and downstairs fucking packed but i heard  the audiences were tough really tough maybe i i always had oh you know who else was from boston i think 
[03:34:30]  uh who's that one line guy um steven wright i said steven wright okay sorry because you're not  listening sue costello sue costello's from boston any girls any other girls uh yeah oh laura  keitlinger isn't she from boston i have no idea neither do i but i threw it out there i think she was  i don't know uh who else okay we don't have to go through them all i want to name every comic  from boston i think there's more strong well i mean new york had some strong comics come out of 
[03:35:00]  new york too i mean where's jim florentine from new jersey oh uh ray romano new york now we're just  gonna do yeah yeah who else from new york that's you know dennis wolfberg you know fucking i don't  know who dennis wolfberg is but i know like his name comes up all the time i don't even like tell  me one dennis wolfberg joke can you remember he used to do one on a colonoscopy a big one it was 
[03:35:30]  he hadn't he was had such straight stage presence and energy and a weird look that i don't remember  his material but he's security remind me like who huh who would he remind you of i don't know like  kind of like a not a lewis black uh like a lot of movement and facial uh and then he did rants or  bitch some rant he was he just killed he i've never seen anybody fucking kill on stage like i don't 
[03:36:00]  think i really like ranting comments not ranting he wasn't a ranter he was a no that was more of a  an aside what what are you talking about i just get tired of comics ranting about stuff that's so  stupid why stanhope is a great ranter even though i don't agree with everything he rants about  no i know but he's different because he's also taking an opposite side like like it's like when  people are ranting against like reality stars it's like oh brother shut up you know what i mean like 
[03:36:30]  if i feel like if doug stanhope did it he would have an original take on that not just like  what you're the same if your grandmother has ranted about it maybe you should have a different  take on it if you're going to take it to the stage you know what i mean i always say you got to be  funnier than your mom that's your grandma or your mom i always see i i mean the ranting thing i'll go  grandma but my general philosophy with comedians is you got to be funnier than if you want to do this 
[03:37:00]  for a living you got to at least be funnier than your mom i i would agree with that that's but  what about  that's why melissa rivers could never do it but a lot of male comics that are famous yeah like their  kids do comedy there's not too many female famous comics where their kids do comedy they don't have  kids generally well uh who joan rivers melissa who uh oh uh let me think 
[03:37:30]  oh that's a tough one there like carol burnett she has kids yeah i think yeah don't say it because  i just remembered something bad yeah that was sad who else yeah but carol burnett wasn't really a  stand-up although she was as funny as anybody but you know richard prior's daughter is a comedian  yeah so is carlin's daughter right i don't know if she's a comedian or more like a one person show 
[03:38:00]  person yeah like a performance artist like a performer but also like doesn't she put together  some festival and stuff too i don't know i've never met her do kitty bruce do no i don't know  she did yes yes that's his that's uh um the mom right no the daughter kitty no daughter's name i  just remember now lenny bruce's mom was a stand-up yeah lenny bruce's mom was she might have been 
[03:38:30]  she was in vaudeville she did vaudeville yeah she might have been like she was like definitely  early one of the earliest female um but uh his wife's name was kitty bruce that's why he's so  funny because he had to be funnier than his mom is that it you have to you have to be funnier than  your mom like like look at you you're my mom's not funny so it was easy for me it was easy decision  for me houston had some good stand-ups kennison and we're going back to that yeah i like how you don't 
[03:39:00]  you're not limited by what the other person's talking about at all in the conversation you just  go straight to what you want i like that about you we were done we would you won't we got the point  you got to be funnier than your mom cap it you never cap it you just take this is all part of  the conversation houston has some good ones i can name hicks kennison you don't do segues you just  go straight in fred greenlee was funny back in the day uh jimmy pineapple was funny back in the day  we don't need to go over names like jimmy pineapple once we get to like a jimmy pineapple you think that 
[03:39:30]  was his real last name pineapple i don't know sure there's somebody named pineapple you know what we  haven't done we haven't done a shout out to a comic lately we haven't done that lately  nate begotts nate oh okay let's let's hear you butcher his last name one of rich's best friends  go ahead he's not a best friend he's a good friend he's a friend one of your best begottsy  ha ha nate begottsy got a tv uh pilot got a pilot about himself about himself stop stop doing that 
[03:40:00]  what am i doing you know what you're doing doing uh i'm not doing that  go ahead so shout out to nate oh you know who else was at the podcast when we were in la  podcast festival sklar brothers were at the festival i love those guys they're so nice they're so nice 
[03:40:30]  i've already told my sklar story so i can't tell i like them too all right so now bonnie they're  both married married yeah they both are they have kids kids they have kids i don't know i'm not sure  what if they live next door i want them to live next door to each other yeah that would be the sitcom  because you know the thing about the sklars that i always think they have to practice  it's not like you or i just you know you practice i come home and see yeah yeah i write 
[03:41:00]  so i get it out of my mouth that way i don't get to go on stage as much as  bonnie i stand on the ottoman bonnie makes reina sit down on  no i never made reina listen never no but reina sometimes will pop her head in and be like  that's not a funny joke she said that before really uh-huh reina knows comedy she's got to be 
[03:41:30]  funnier than her mom yes she's got to really if she wants to go into it ahead of her oh  oh i'm doubled over with laughter um bonnie did uh talk about your uh female comedy festival in  portland oregon so i did a female all-female comedy festival called uh all jane no dick it's a it's a 
[03:42:00]  funny little title that's a cute clever title i think all jane no dick comedy festival uh-huh and  portland oregon i never been to portland uh never even been to oregon turns out that weekend rich was  local so uh i was allowed to go and uh what are you what are you doing nothing i'm listening i can't  talk if you're not like paying attention all right go ahead so uh well i don't know what am i going to  talk about what do i want talk about you showed the movie in the festival you did a q a huge like 
[03:42:30]  the it was a huge screen it was weird to see it on that i mean like the biggest screen you've ever  seen why didn't you uh condense it okay i don't know what you mean letterbox it i just handed him  the dvd and we don't have it in a letterbox okay and then oh but i had to do a lot of like podcasts 
[03:43:00]  and you know what's good about letterbox panels about women in comedy which was interesting  it was interesting because i felt like i i i don't know why i felt like i constantly had to  be the voice of it's not that bad  you know  and the thing is i made a movie about it so people think that like i'm real 
[03:43:30]  like i'm i'm i'm out there like women are funny god damn it you know but the truth is i'm kind of  making fun of the whole thing and i don't know i don't even know what to think about it anymore i  really don't like i'm done i'm my brain hurts like on the one hand it's like i don't care if people  don't think you're funny it's like oh shut up who cares and then on the other hand uh like if  there was people that said jews aren't funny i don't think that would bother me it would because 
[03:44:00]  you you it bothers you anything then no because there's just the proof the proof is there if you  know so you go okay well there's the proof and there's a proof for females so like so why do people  get so fucking wrapped up that's the other thing i don't know why women get so mad about it i really  don't and i mean they they were getting mad about it um i mean one woman was kind of saying like that 
[03:44:30]  she doesn't like it if there's an audience of with women in it that aren't laughing at another woman like  the idea that if you're a woman you have to support women which i just think is so gross in a way like  why should i have to like somebody or they were bringing up like this woman does this joke which  i don't think is appropriate or whatever and it's like who cares not every guy likes every guy  you know here's the thing if someone came up to you and said women aren't funny and all you have to do  is say back i'm funny all you gotta do is stick up for yourself you don't have to you can't fight for 
[03:45:00]  your whole gender your whole race your whole you know what i mean it's just i agree and i mean  there's women that i think are really exceptionally funny and there's women i don't think are funny like  why should i have to go live as someone i don't think is funny why do i have to like somebody  but the ones that aren't funny are the ones that are fighting heading the battle they're the ones in  the front line instead of focusing on getting funny i think that's kind of true i'm starting to see that  as a thing like the like like if you're constantly talking about we are funny then i don't know it just 
[03:45:30]  seems like the women that are but but if you're getting ahead then you don't have to talk about it  you don't have to discuss like you don't hear you know it's easy to hear um um uh chelsea handler  or maria any of them go hey maria bamford or any yeah any any tig you don't hear any of them  unless you watch our movie no but they're not but in the movie they're not whining about it either 
[03:46:00]  no not at all and this is off off book about the movie i was reading the dumb message board which i  haven't read in a year the uh whack bag yeah and there's a guy and it goes you know they were  talking about women being funny and he's like yeah rich faust and bonnie made a movie with opie's  money listen you jackass the money in this movie cares but again like why would you get mad at that  who cares that's this guy no this guy you know he's been trashing me on the who cares it's one 
[03:46:30]  one six of the money came from opie one oh my god one six  where you go you can't walk away during the middle of a podcast one one six okay so now i  mentioned you again without using your name on the podcast one six one six of the money but who cares  like i don't well first of all the fact that opie gave us money to to make a movie is great like 
[03:47:00]  that i wish you would have gave all of it well that makes us better that makes us like good we  you know obviously we haven't we haven't talked and hung out with them and had dinner with them in  so long i text i we make plans to hang out all the time and never do it i don't want them to think  we got their money and don't hang out anymore they probably love that we don't they were like good  we paid them off they're out of our hair we don't have to deal with them anymore one six  who rich one six okay if people think opie gave us the money to make the movie great good look at 
[03:47:30]  how cool we are but the truth is we both had to suck his cock one six why don't we go out to dinner  with them i would love to they have kids it's hard every time we make plans either one of one of us  can't get a babysitter well we can have dinner at their house we go over there and they always order  food yeah i guess we could make plans well how do i invite myself over to her house 
[03:48:00]  huh are you by yourself over you go hey we're in the lobby hey look do you guys want to have dinner  we'd ask you to come to our place but it's pretty far so pretty far we were thinking you guys have it  at your place and order food and pay for it is that cool i would i always offer to pay they never take  our money huh one sixth of the time we pay 
[03:48:30]  so the festival which bonnie gave him a great deal headlined the festival  yeah i still haven't gotten paid should i send off an angry email yeah that's what i was going to talk  about they're just these people just you know it's god god damn you can't fight city hall you can't 
[03:49:00]  fight city hall that's what i'm saying homeland rich wants to do a podcast called 25 things wrong with  homeland but the only problem is is that we're uh we're a season behind we're on season two we're  watching we could start watching season three when we're done this one because we have showtime  now oh you're right for a couple months it's only once every six podcasts i get rich to say you're 
[03:49:30]  right while we have showtime because i call because you called and got angry got mad they gave us showtime  for three months for free we say we give to anybody for free for three months we just keep calling every  one of the ones i'm gonna have you call uh everything's wrong with homeland it just  this fucking broad first of all you don't you don't say someone's a terrorist and then start sleeping with  them when you're and why would the cia allow it well she's doing it for her country no it's too stupid 
[03:50:00]  who runs into trouble every time without a weapon what cia agent well because i realized like she keeps  doing the same things expecting different results and she is insane so it makes sense she's obsessed  she's obsessed they i mean in season two they did catch a guy she was after but if she's a cia agent  and she's reinstated or work how she never has a gun she chased after him with a pipe it's too dumb 
[03:50:30]  it's ridiculous why doesn't she have a gun and the the wife was the wife's name dana oh the one with  the neck she looks like beetlejuice when he had a long neck and came brody's wife is i don't know  why i read an article once that was like every show you hate the wife which is true when you think  about it you know i'm breaking bad he hated the wife like but that's the only show you could come 
[03:51:00]  up with boardwalk empire but she's not on it anymore oh yeah hated the wife but like i don't know why  is it the casting is it because it stops the storyline i don't moving forward there's something  about this chick i cannot take it the daughter is worse and the daughter too i want them both to get  hit by a bus i can't and i hate the son just for the fact that he's the brother of the girl and i hate  him because he won't fucking pull out a knife and stab the both in the face do us a favor dude 
[03:51:30]  fucking it's we killed somebody and then last night we caught up on uh boardwalk empire last night  and uh if what's his name would have got killed i wouldn't i wouldn't watch it anymore yeah if  omar would have got killed what's his name on uh boardwalk empire uh whitey no it isn't it is mr  white no it isn't whitey it is no is it yeah you've only been watching it for three seasons 
[03:52:00]  good all right i guess we're at the end we've wrapped up our tv shows we got nothing this week  yeah i'm in uh orlando at the improv this week no i didn't mean that i just meant in terms of  entertainment entertainment value i hate i hate to bring you all the way to the end to let you know  this is not worth listening to this was very worth listening to it was this is one of our best 
[03:52:30]  podcast why do you always say that it's not true what did you just do i spit out a piece of egg that  was on my tongue and i watched it fly across the room i went like that you never do that with food  that's stuck in your mouth you go like this and it flies huh you never really do that right you i can't  i i don't have words to discuss who's that never mind who texts you in the middle of the day  let me see how can we let me see

[03:54:00]  your life well you know what he has self-respect he quit the video but why like i don't understand  what his problem was with it i hate like i hate singing i don't know that was 10 years ago you know  x factor we didn't even watch it once this year is it still on is it over who cares what happened  we used to love all that shit we moved on we barely even watched idol when it comes on  apprentice we we lost interest in the apprentice what happened we had all hey tv got better we moved 
[03:54:30]  we moved up with it well i mean you know and and somehow we're uh we're letting tutors slip through  our fingers again that's because of the netflix you know we started watching tutors what season are  we on season two of tutors right tutors season two of tutors season two of tutors and we're just  because homeland and boardwalk empire what else did we just finish i can't believe we're really having
