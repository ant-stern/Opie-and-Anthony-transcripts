<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The April 25th, 2000, Opie and Anthony Show began with a phone call from their "Southern boss" announcing record-high ratings, making them number one across key demographics.  Despite the celebratory news, the boss sternly warned against future stunts, threatening job termination.  Opie and Anthony, elated by their success, discussed plans to thank listeners with a beer buy-in, encountering logistical hurdles in finding a suitable venue due to pre-existing commitments and closures. They sought listener suggestions.

A substantial portion of the show detailed the previous night's escapades involving Psycho Mark and Stinky.  Stinky's attempt to display a "WOW" sign upside down during live television broadcasts on Channels 7 and 11 resulted in a chase by a cameraman and subsequent apprehension by several police officers near a fundraiser attended by President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Hillary Clinton. Psycho Mark was also involved and briefly detained. Both Stinky and Psycho Mark were interviewed in-studio, recounting the incident and their injuries, which were the subject of much mockery from the hosts.  The hosts promoted new "WOW" stickers to be distributed by Psycho Mark outside the Brooklyn Diner and teased an upcoming listener appreciation event, hinting at a possible strip club location.

The show continued with further discussion of the ratings success and the ensuing celebration.  The hosts recounted the Psycho Mark and Stinky incident, comparing the adrenaline rush to a drug high.  They mentioned needing to show ID and expressed relief that Black Earl wasn’t involved. The planned listener appreciation party at a strip club was heavily discussed, acknowledging their primarily male audience and attempts to attract more female listeners.  Female callers expressed mixed feelings about the location, with some expressing concerns and others viewing it as potentially fun.  The hosts repeatedly stressed there would be no harassment.  Negotiations with club representatives, relayed through phone calls, determined the cover charge would be waived, a free buffet provided, and the first round of drinks on the show.  Listener calls, discussion about photoshopped images of the Elian Gonzalez situation, and promotion of the “WOW” stickers continued. The event was ultimately confirmed to be at Privilege, a strip club at 23rd and 11th Avenue.

Numerous congratulatory calls followed, featuring rambling, often vulgar, thank-yous from listeners, friends, and associates, including Mike Tyson (who threatened violence if not properly thanked) and Weird Al Yankovic (who offered a joking congratulation).  Other callers used pseudonyms like "The Fart Guy," "Old Dirty," and "Spaz."  The hosts thanked numerous people on and off-air, including past antagonists. The upcoming strip club celebration at Privilege, with a free buffet and drinks, was repeatedly mentioned.  A humorous, yet offensive, Lamb Chop puppet interview was included, along with commercials for Car Cash and Ranch One.  A wrestling pay-per-view and a listener-submitted photo caption contest on foundrymusic.com were also promoted.  The segment concluded with a bizarre phone call involving a listener attempting to get his sister to engage in sexually suggestive acts on air.

The final segment opened with a humorous call about a listener's unsuccessful attempts to find "naked chicks." The hosts reiterated plans for the Privilege event, emphasizing the 21-and-over age restriction.  A major focus was a confrontation with Spaz, a show employee, who refused to attend Privilege due to moving plans. This led to a heated exchange, accusations of Spaz being "pussy whipped," and attempts to get Spaz and his girlfriend, Erica, on the air.  Erica eventually agreed to attend. The broadcast culminated in an in-studio brawl between Spaz and Old Dirty, escalating to include Rick, resulting in Spaz punching Rick and knocking a clock off the wall, which then hit Rick. The fight was detailed with play-by-play commentary from the hosts and callers.  The show concluded with the hosts reiterating their Privilege plans and promising further mayhem on the next show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's about as funny as a sinking school boat.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys make me blow chucks.  Great!  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Opie and Anthony.  What a couple of ass wipes.  1-0-2-7.  WNEW.  It's the ONA Show.  Dang!  For Tuesday, April 25th, 2000.  Yeah.  I'm hearing things. 
[00:00:30]  I'm hearing things.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, everyone looks so happy in the hallway.  Why are all the newspapers calling the Opie and Anthony show today?  I'm hearing things.  I don't understand.  Can't confirm it myself, but I'm hearing things.  Huh.  That's fascinating.  That's fascinating.  Phone line 212-757-1027. 
[00:01:00]  The fax line 212-957-9639.  Hearing things.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hey, boss.  Oh, it's our southern boss.  How you doing?  God damn doing good, boss.  Let me just tell you.  Wait, wait.  We've been...  Wait, can I preface this by saying this is what we heard about two hours ago now? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two hours.  Sorry, Ed.  Sorry.  Continue.  Hey, boy.  I've been thumbing through some of the paperwork here that we like to call the ratings.  The ratings, yes.  The ratings.  That's what I said.  The ratings.  God damn.  God damn.  And, uh, Jesus Christ, I don't know how the hell you did it, but I'm looking through  the ratings here.  Yeah.  1834, man?  Yeah.  You boys are number one.  God damn. 
[00:02:00]  2554, man?  Yeah.  God damn you're number one.  I don't understand how this happened.  Sir, how about 1849, man?  All right.  Let me look here.  Okay.  Please, God.  I'll never be able to look at them.  Oh, God damn.  And number one.  Number one.  Boy, this seems to be the highest book you've gotten since you've been at N.E.W.  Well, thank you, sir. 
[00:02:30]  Now, I'm very proud of you, and we knew you would do this because you're a very talented  boy.  Yeah.  I saw that when I met with you for three minutes before you were hired.  Right.  But I've got to tell you something.  What?  You're going to congratulate us?  Well, okay.  That tool.  Congratulations.  You're going to send us some gifts, maybe?  Some champagne so we can celebrate?  Maybe some Cuban cigars or something?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Well, what?  You're going to find a job for the company. 
[00:03:00]  Okay.  We want you here a long time.  Yes.  Growing as you have.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But God damn one more stunt like that, and you're out the door.  I don't care what your numbers are.  I don't care if you're number one with 85-year-old nuns.  You will be gone like crap to a dookie.  And I'm making myself clear.  Yeah.  But today shouldn't we just be celebrating the fact that we did pretty well in the ratings  here in New York?  I've got to keep you boys in check. 
[00:03:30]  You don't understand.  You boys screw up and the heat comes down on me.  Don't you understand?  But don't you understand that this is why we do well in the ratings, because we're so  out of control?  You boys, you don't understand.  You are out of control.  Yeah.  You've got to be smart, not stupid.  You boys are stupid.  The number one stupid is what you are.  I don't know who the hell's listening to you. 
[00:04:00]  They must be stupid, too.  Well, sir, they're our listeners.  We don't want you calling our listeners stupid.  I don't care who they are, as long as I never got to meet them.  Quite frankly, they scare the crap out of me.  Well, they scare the hell out of us sometimes, too, sir.  God damn.  Yeah.  Well, like I said, good job.  Thank you.  Very impressed.  Very good job for the company.  Thank you.  You're company boys.  I like that.  That's right. 
[00:04:30]  And you've done a fine job.  Yeah.  But one more error.  I swear to God, you will feel my boot in your ass, and you will not work in this country  again, in this industry.  We own everything, and I think next week we're trying to buy Baskin Robbins, so you won't  even be able to make a high-speed call.  Sir, now that we're number one.  Do we own all the people, Hans?  Yeah, pretty much.  I think we're going to hold it, too, and then make a merger.  Sir, this is like the third book in a row where you've been number one in all the key 
[00:05:00]  demos.  Yeah.  So, could we start talking about maybe syndicating the show?  Oh, boy, now that is funny.  God damn, you boys are funny.  In the what?  Syndication?  Yeah, that's the worst.  Yeah.  God damn, that's funny, boy.  Okay, you boys keep it up.  Bye-bye.  Oh, here's a clear answer. 
[00:05:30]  Well, that's pretty much what we heard a couple hours ago.  Oh, my God.  We're still stupid.  We're still stupid.  It doesn't matter.  But we're number one again in all the key demos.  Best book since moving back to New York.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you very, very much.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  Oh, my God, the boss. 
[00:06:00]  Well, I'm hearing rumors that we did really well.  Yeah.  Really well.  Thank you.  I want to thank our listeners.  It is the People's Radio Show.  We've got to do something.  If it was up to me, I want to go out right after the show and just buy beers for our listeners.  Can we do that?  We need a place.  If we can find a place, I think we can do it.  If we grab some bar in Midtown?  Yeah.  And we'll just buy beers for the listeners.  We've got to thank them.  Absolutely. 
[00:06:30]  It's their show, too.  We're just the figureheads of this radio show.  Yes.  Our listeners are a huge part of this, so we've got to celebrate with them.  Yeah, you bastards have got to take some responsibility for this mess.  Can't just be us.  Some of the best stuff that gets on the radio is from you guys.  For the love of God.  Yeah, we need to find a bar.  Our regular places, like Hooters and La Barbat, they're kind of booked.  They're out of business.  I think they closed Hooters.  I'm not really sure.  They closed Hooters officially?  Supposedly for renovations.  For renovations.  For renovations.  And our pals at La Barbat have something else going on with another radio station I'm hearing. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  We need to find just a cool bar that'll have, I don't know, 300 to 500 of our listeners so we can buy them a beer.  Yeah, we'll shove in there and buy a few beers.  Where?  Midtown.  That's what we need.  Yeah, anywhere in the area.  We don't know where to go.  We're being honest.  There's no other places around the station that we can think of.  So if anyone has an idea, you own a place and you're a fan of the show and you want to help us out. 
[00:07:30]  Here's your chance.  You're a bar owner.  You want a relationship with the station and the show and stuff, give us a call.  We'd love to come down after the show, drink a few beers.  Yeah.  So we want to thank the listeners.  Definitely want to thank Rick, our producer, working his ass off.  Well, you can.  Nah, this is...  I mean, we'll start goofing on him, like, after this, but I want to thank Rick.  I want to thank Spaz.  I want to thank Stinky.  I want to thank John.  I want to thank Ben.  And, of course, Psycho Mark.  Oh, yes.  We have a huge story as far as Psycho Mark goes. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, what, he almost got arrested last night?  He almost got arrested last night.  Wow made it on TV again last night.  And Stinky was treated like Abner Louima.  Correct.  Well, we've got to find Stinky.  We haven't heard from him since he was cuffed from last night.  That's all we'll say right now.  Yeah.  So, Stinky, if you're out there, you need to call the show, okay?  We'll get into that story and other things.  We'll go to the phones next, of course.  Our phone line, 212-757-1027.  But, once again, thank you to you guys. 
[00:08:30]  Yes.  We're hearing very good things about the ratings that came out a few hours ago, and we greatly appreciate it, okay?  Mm-hmm.  It's been a long, long two years.  Don't get carried away, goddammit.  We're not.  Get all full of yourself, because I swear to God, by tomorrow you'll be back in the doghouse again with one foot out the door and the other on a skateboard.  I'm crappy or not?  What's it going to take to make that damn guy happy down there?  Nothing.  Nothing. 
[00:09:00]  My buddy.  I don't think we can do any better in the ratings, and the guy still yells at us.  I'd love to get him on the phone, man, and just ask him straight out.  Yeah.  On the air.  Yeah.  You know, what do you think?  Are we progressing in your mind?  Mm-hmm.  Are we better off than we were when we first came here?  Yeah.  How do we stand with you and the company?  Right.  For the love of God.  Right.  He gives us these backhand compliments always.  Totally backhanded compliments. 
[00:09:30]  It's like he congratulates you for 30 seconds and yells at you for five.  I don't know how, but you done it.  Right.  It's like, thanks?  What?  Thank you.  I think, sir.  I think.  Right.  I don't even remember what he looks like.  I just, my image of him is a speakerphone.  Just a crackly speakerphone.  What are you doing?  Yeah, because usually it's like, hold on, sir.  I'll get Anthony, sir.  And then we put him on the speakerphone.  It's so funny.  And that's the exact way we hear him. 
[00:10:00]  Our boss is on the regular handset phone, and he has to do the preliminary.  Yeah.  So he's like, yes.  No, I know.  Yeah.  Okay.  No, we understand.  Yeah, they're right here.  Okay, hold on.  And he puts the receiver down and hits the speaker thing.  It's like, okay, Opie and Anthony are here in the office.  I can hear me?  Yeah, we hear you.  Yeah, we can hear you.  What the hell are you doing?  And it's just like the windows shake.  It's a rattly little speakerphone speaker, so it sounds even worse. 
[00:10:30]  Nothing makes him happy.  I forgot what he looks like.  The best was today, though.  Well, I got the ratings here.  Yeah.  Looks like your boys did real well.  Just like you did it, man.  Good job.  Very good.  Very good for the company.  Company.  Company.  Company.  But it don't matter.  The more your ratings go up, the more it don't matter.  All right.  I love that guy. 
[00:11:00]  We got Kevin from Privilege.  Wow.  Getting three or four hundred of our listeners into a strip club after the show.  Oh, yeah.  Beers are on us, though, they're saying.  That means we don't even have to buy them.  Oh.  Oh, no.  That could be ugly.  Oh, no.  They don't understand what our listeners can do in a strip club.  They're pretty cool.  All right.  We'll see what happens.  We're going to try to figure out something, but we want to just go out and have a beer with you guys and thank you.  Yeah.  And buy the first beer. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, why not, man?  We'll buy the first beer until we run out of money, and then you're on your own.  All right, man.  Let's take a break, okay?  Yeah, let's get set.  We'll go right to the phones next.  We have a great story.  Psycho Mark and Stinky almost arrested last night.  We have brand new wow stickers that we're going to be giving out all over the damn tri-state area.  I think we're going to have some to give away right outside the building all day long here today.  We've got to work that out.  How come when, like, Reverend Al is walking around and he gets arrested, it's like nothing?  There's no scuffle.  There's nothing.  He's just arrested. 
[00:12:00]  And you barely even know he was being arrested.  It looks like he's being escorted away.  But when anyone from our show has a confrontation with the police, I swear to God, it looks like the Watts riots.  On the ground, knee in the back.  I can't wait to get into this story.  We'll do it right after commercials, I promise.  Everyone's on hold.  Felony wowing?  Because a lot of people saw it.  Look at all the phone lines.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't see it live.  Ben had to tell me as soon as I walked in today.  The tape is classic.  And we'll get Psycho Mark in here in just a bit.  Stay there.  Our phone number, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[00:12:30]  Hey, this is Jim Brewer, and I've been up since, like, oh, I don't know, yesterday.  And the only thing that gets me going, Hammer, is Opie and Anthony.  I'm talking 1-0-2-7-N-E-W, Hammer.  I got to pee.  Come and go, over.  Don't you have any self-respect?  Aren't you embarrassed to yourself or your family?  Opie and Anthony.  You inhuman slime! 
[00:13:00]  1027-WNEW.  Oh, boy.  We're trying to figure out where to go after the show today.  See, real hard decisions.  If you're just tuning in, we're hearing rumors.  Well, we have confirmed it with the Southern boss.  We just don't know how well we did, but Ann and I just killed in the ratings.  Thank you.  We love that.  Every three months, we get an ulcer.  And then the ratings come out, and we feel good for a day. 
[00:13:30]  And then it's back to being crapped on.  Yeah.  Great.  Yeah, that's how it works.  But before we go back to that, we want to, like, celebrate with you guys today.  We have a bunch of strip clubs checking in.  They want to give us free beer.  It's not Ann and I.  We're talking the listeners, free beer.  That's just crazy.  Yeah, well, that's what we want to do.  We want to, after the show, get together with some of the listeners and help to bring us up in the ratings to where we are.  Thank you.  All right, listen.  This is the deal.  We honestly don't know where we're going yet. 
[00:14:00]  We're going to try to go somewhere right at 7.  We'll get there by 7.20 or so, because we have to, you know, pack up.  Yeah.  Just keep listening to the radio.  This isn't a radio tease.  We really don't know where we're going yet, because we were going to go to, like, La Barbat, but, you know, they're busy with another party.  Or Hooters, and Hooters is closed, so we have to find a new place.  Some of the contenders for where we'll be going after the show, oh, this is going to be good.  This could be a very good thank you to the listeners. 
[00:14:30]  The problem is they're small places, so when we announce it, man, you've got to just get there immediately, because there's no way we're going to get everyone inside.  And Ann and I are pretty much buying the first round.  Yep.  Or the club, in some cases.  The club is now saying, screw you guys.  You guys should have some free beer, too.  So now they're saying they'll take the tab.  Well, maybe we can buy a round, and the club can buy a round.  You know, our listeners like to drink.  Yeah, we can handle that. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Because that's what we truly want to do.  So stick around for that, okay?  A couple of those places.  The scenery would be very nice in the club, too, wouldn't it?  Well, we said a bunch of strip clubs want to throw us a little congratulatory, you know, beer party.  What a thank you for the listeners, that would be.  Being able to just hang out in the strip club.  Goddamn.  We did warn these places of what damage our listeners could do, right?  Okay.  As long as they know. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  As long as they know.  Cool.  All right, we'll have it figured out very, very soon.  Another hour?  Yeah.  We have to give people time to get there.  All right.  I guess, Anna, we're definitely going out after the show.  Yeah.  Okay, we're definitely going out after the show.  We're definitely doing something in Midtown, Manhattan in general, okay?  Because we're checking out some places all over the place.  So just kind of circle the area and wait, and we'll let you know where we're going to be, okay?  Going to orbit.  You'll be very, very happy, though. 
[00:16:00]  We've got to just make sure everyone's cool with this, management, the club, things like that, okay?  And then...  There goes Ben to check on it right now.  He's going down the hall.  Then we are going to party.  We are going to party.  Yeah.  And thank you, guys.  All right, let's go to the phones, Anthony.  A big night on TV last night.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you, Dave?  Listen, I was watching the ABC News last night, and I saw this guy.  He was a broadcaster, and your guys came up with the big wow sign. 
[00:16:30]  Well, first of all, I think it was, what, Channel 11?  Channel 11.  Channel 7.  Channel 7, too?  Yeah, ABC has it on.  All right, I think you're talking about Channel 11.  No, ABC had one, too?  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah, Sycamore got into a live feed.  It was a live broadcast on ABC.  Well, you got on Channel 7 and 11 last night?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What were you accosted for?  But the problem was with Channel 11, right?  Yes.  Yeah, I saw the cops chasing after him on Channel 11.  That was the funniest thing, laughing, laughing cops chasing after Sycamore. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, all of a sudden, the wow sign's off the air,  and the cops are like chasing after him.  Yeah, you see three or four cops go running down the road.  We're going to get Sycamore telling the story in a second here.  And this is the second time that this reporter has been loud on.  What's his name?  I forget, but this is, there was one, the two guys, Anthony and his buddy, Steve,  they put the sign in front of his face, and he got all scared. 
[00:17:30]  Remember that one?  Oh, that's the guy?  Yeah, it's the same guy.  What's his name?  Rob, what's up?  Hey, Rob.  Hey, you're on the air, you dope.  Hey, Rob, last chance, you're on the air.  Hello.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on?  This is the reason why we're number one, because our listeners are so quick and with it.  Yeah, I'm totally convinced that your listeners are as stupid as you guys.  Okay.  I see some guy running behind Channel 11 with an upside-down wow sign.  I know, that was stinky. 
[00:18:00]  That's why he's the clone of Spaz.  He had his chance to get the wow sign on TV last night, and he did it upside-down.  He was holding a mom sign.  Yeah, then the cops started chasing him.  First, the cameraman from Channel 11 started chasing him.  Yeah.  We've got to have Psycho Mark and Stinky come in so they can talk about it.  Right.  But the cameraman left the camera.  He's doing a live broadcast.  The reporter's in front of the camera doing his little thing.  Stinky comes up and starts waving the upside-down wow banner.  Good job, Stinky. 
[00:18:30]  The cameraman just bolts away from his post.  Yeah.  Leaves the camera to beat the crap out of Stinky.  He's chasing him down the street.  Then you see three or four cops run by the camera.  You see a sergeant run by.  And then in the background, you see Psycho Mark running after Stinky to make sure he's going to be okay.  And if you have a tape of last night's wowing on Channel 11, look closely.  In the background, way in the background, you see Psycho Mark running down the sidewalk.  Run past.  Run past.  Checking out Stinky to make sure he's okay.  Tries to recover the banner, and then before he knows it, he's up against the wall getting buffed. 
[00:19:00]  It's just a mess.  Well, let's get Psycho Mark in here.  Psycho Mark, let's go.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  I'm okay.  How's it going?  Good.  The best part about it was the cameraman came out of the left part of the screen, and  his lips were clenched.  Like he wanted to beat his butt bad.  He wanted so bad to punch somebody.  You guys, it was like a Tom Green show.  You guys were so funny.  It was so funny last night. 
[00:19:30]  It's the second time.  I'm watching the news.  The guy's trying to say how Hillary Clinton's inside kissing butt.  And then all of a sudden, he comes out of nowhere.  Upside to upside.  It was so funny, he just came out of the darkness from beyond.  Let me tell you something.  You guys have made Mike drive home so much better, and it's great.  I just want to tell you, I've got a quick joke for you.  You guys probably heard it already.  Why didn't Bill Clinton get involved with the Elian Gonzalez case?  Why?  Because you know what happened the last time he tried to play for Cuban.  Yeah.  You didn't like it?  It's all right. 
[00:20:00]  Take care, guys.  Good job, man.  All right.  Now, what's the name of the reporter?  Because he was the reporter that got the tiny wow sign put directly in front of his face  while he was doing a live report about a month and a half ago.  And the guy yelled something like, oh.  Yeah.  No, he goes, hey.  Hey.  Hey.  He puts the sign in front of his face, and the reporter got the crap skin out of him.  And that was the same camera guy that chased after Steve and Anthony, too.  This camera guy, he, oh, you should see his face.  He wanted blood.  I'm screaming to Stinky. 
[00:20:30]  I'm going, run, Stinky, run!  I was lanky, stinky trying to run down the street with a cameraman chasing him, and then  the cops chasing him.  All right.  Let's get the whole story from Psycho Mark.  He's in the studio.  Obviously, they were reporting on the Clintons in town and Al Gore in town, right, at that  fundraiser or whatever it was.  And it was too good to be true.  It was right around the corner from the home here.  Home base.  So you did Channel 7 and 11 last night?  I didn't know it was Channel 7.  I just saw a big network feed with a satellite truck, and a lot of times they'll use one 
[00:21:00]  truck for a bunch of different things.  And I saw him.  He was going live, and so was I.  So I did that one first, and then I got Ben on the phone, and he helped me coordinate  the second one with Channel 11.  Yeah.  I was making sure he was watching TV, and he gave me the cue.  Yeah, that's the best, when you have somebody watching TV at home so they can tell you,  okay, he's live.  Go in now.  So he's just like, you know, he's just like a, you know, a Navy SEAL on the other line 
[00:21:30]  going, go, go, go, forward observer.  Right, forward observer.  Well, what we got to explain with what everyone got to see at home was the reporter was on  one side of the street.  You were across the street in front of the hotel, I guess, right?  Pretty much, yep.  And all of a sudden, while the guy's doing the live report, you see this sign come out  of the darkness.  Out of nowhere.  The debut of the new huge wow sign.  The brand new wow logo.  And you had a run in between traffic, because there was a lot of traffic.  You timed it perfect.  You couldn't have been timed. 
[00:22:00]  So all of a sudden, the guy is doing his report, and now there's just this huge wow sign  behind him, and you're jumping up and down the middle of traffic, and then what happened  from there?  They're screaming like lunatics, and then all of a sudden, the camera guy drops everything.  I'm going, holy ass, I can't believe he's dropping his post, and he makes a beeline  right for me and Stinky.  So we retreat right back across the street, and thank God there was no traffic.  Yeah, you guys didn't even look.  You just ran into the street.  I was like, I'd rather get hit by a bus than this guy, because he's really pissed. 
[00:22:30]  He wanted to choke us.  So one isn't good enough, Opie.  No, so we get...  Well, wait, wait, wait.  So what happened after that?  They chased you?  They couldn't get you, so they just left you alone?  All I hear on the phone is Ben screaming his brains out, you got it, you got it, oh,  we got it.  Not only that, they had gone from his live shot to a filmed clip, and they were waiting  to come back to another live shot, so the camera guy couldn't go running off.  He had to stay at his post, because they were setting up for another live shot in about a 
[00:23:00]  minute when they get through with the film.  So they couldn't leave well enough alone.  They got the wow on.  They escaped unscathed, pissed off another cameraman.  Mission accomplished.  Right.  But no, they got to go back for more.  So we're standing right after the first one.  We're hooting and hollering.  There's a bunch of cops standing around.  They're all laughing.  They thought it was the best thing in the whole world.  He and Stinky are giving high fives.  We're like, we got them, we got them.  How quickly victory turns to defeat.  The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. 
[00:23:30]  All of a sudden, they were the guy on the skis falling off the side of the ski jump.  So I'm on the phone with Ben again, and he goes, dude, they're about to go back.  They're about to go back.  So we had the sign all screwed up.  So I just handed it to Stinky.  I said, go ahead.  Unravel the sign as fast as you can.  And as he was unraveling the sign, I'm like, go, go, go.  Get on fast.  And that's when Stinky ran across by himself with the upside down wow sign.  Stupid. 
[00:24:00]  You're so stupid.  It was pretty funny to see it upside down though.  Yeah, it was.  And Stinky, his on-screen debut, just like looking all dopey and everything with the upside down sign.  Jumping up and down with the upside.  It was Marvin Scott, by the way.  Thank you.  Marvin Scott.  Marvin Scott.  Marvin once again getting pounded.  Mark on line eight with that.  Thank you.  And Mark almost got him killed.  Because remember, you said, oh, watch.  Look, these two cabs almost hit him.  Yeah, because the video is classic because you see these cabs just missing Stinky. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, the second sortie wasn't as clean.  As the first one.  Well, the cameraman chases Stinky, and I am not kidding you, a block and a half down the street.  Well, the funniest thing, right when the cameraman bolts from behind his camera, now he's in front of the camera.  You see him run, and he is so pissed, he's biting his lip.  And you see Stinky's face like he looks.  He sees the cameraman's ready to bolt after him.  He looks all scared and just runs.  You see him run off the right side of the screen. 
[00:25:00]  And the cameraman starts chasing.  Now the attention of the cops.  They got the attention of the cops.  So the cops are on camera looking around, and then they slowly start moving towards the right side of the screen.  And then you see a sergeant coming over.  Three more cops coming over.  They're all just running from the left side of the screen to the right side of the screen.  And don't forget the shadowy figure in the back.  Yes.  And then way in the back, on the other side of the street, lurking, you see Psycho Mark cross the screen. 
[00:25:30]  Because you wanted to make sure Stinky was all right.  I was going right after Stinky.  So now, I don't understand how Stinky ran.  Now, he's being chased by the camera guy, by the police.  And why doesn't he keep running straight?  That question, I don't know the answer to.  But he doubles back.  He doubles back.  Runs towards me and literally almost comes by me.  And then the cameraman goes right by me.  And the cameraman trips Stinky.  The cameraman sticks his foot out. 
[00:26:00]  Trips Stinky, who does a header into the side of the Channel 11 news van.  He does everything we missed, Ed.  Was it on camera?  It's too tall.  All right, good.  So he trips and it goes, boom, boom.  And the cops the banner in the middle of the street.  So there's the TV guys on top of Stinky trying to choke him or something.  And then within two seconds, there's five cops on Stinky.  So I go for the wild sign.  I grab the wild sign.  I say, well, these are the wild sign.  I grab the wild sign. 
[00:26:30]  And I'm like, screw it.  I've got to get out here myself.  Yeah.  So I screw around the corner.  Next thing you know, there's three cops grabbing me, pushing me up against the wall.  Boom.  Where are you going?  You're coming along.  I get dragged back over to the Channel 11 van.  They throw me right up against the side.  There's Stinky on the ground, on time.  Okay?  With a cop on his neck.  He was hot tight.  They had him cuffed and stomped.  He's looking up to me going, I didn't know what he did.  I didn't know what he did. 
[00:27:00]  And there's a cop on his neck.  Like, right on his neck.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  So the cameraman's screaming,  You're shooting these guys to do all the time.  Oh.  So next thing you know, we're both put up against the van.  Virgin.  It's Stinky in prison.  Virgin.  Hey!  Virgin.  Virgin.  So he was hot tight, really? 
[00:27:30]  Dude, they had him cuffed and stomped.  Like a Boston crab.  How is he holding up under the pressure?  So do you see his face?  He's looking up at you?  His face is like on the side of the pavement, like this, you know?  Hey, guys, honey.  You know what I'm doing?  And they're just looking up at me.  And I'm standing up.  They're having me up against the van.  I can't make a move.  They're like, you guys, we could have shot you two.  Oh, yeah.  They thought we robbed somebody. 
[00:28:00]  Because we were running so fast.  They thought we pickpocketed the cameraman.  Not too much police in the area, since the president and first lady and vice president.  Oh, yeah.  It's the first time all three of them were in town at the same time.  He's like a mere few yards away from the president of the United States and the vice president.  So, I mean, they are on extra guard at any problem.  And I think it's a good time to do a second wowing. 
[00:28:30]  You are out of your mind.  It was jerk fun.  Stinky was voted queen of the weight room prom.  So, you guys did not have to go down to the station house.  Well, I can't mention any names, but there was probably about 15 or 20 cops surrounding us.  Not to mention like 100 people just standing there in total amazement as to what's going on.  I didn't do nothing.  I didn't do nothing. 
[00:29:00]  Deny.  Kiss my ass.  Deny.  Deny.  Deny.  You kiss my ass, you.  I don't know what you're talking about.  First of all, I saw him causing a rug.  Get your hands off and make you son of a bitch.  I ain't going.  This is my house.  My house.  So, one of the big wig cops, okay, says, I want them sent down and send them through the system.  I am literally felony wowing at this point.  Oh, yeah.  You've got the sweat dumps at this point. 
[00:29:30]  What's the charge?  Right.  What's the charge for putting a sign in front of a camera?  Disturbing the peace or something.  Disturbing the peace?  Really?  We cost a major disturbance.  He said you saw the tape.  Yeah, yeah, I guess so, but I think the cameraman caused more of a disturbance.  Yeah, the cop, they were, that head cop was so mad.  It didn't matter.  He would have charged us with cocaine possession.  It didn't matter at that point.  They were going down for something.  Jail. 
[00:30:00]  But the funny part was a lot of the cops really then found out who we were.  It was Michael Mark and Stinky.  Well, first of all, obviously we love the cops, and they listen to the show.  A lot of cops are fans of this show.  You put them in a bad position.  They're like, oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm a fan of the show, but, oh, jeez.  I thought it was.  It's like, oh, no.  My sergeant's going to kill him if I don't do it.  The idea that they're all standing by giggling and laughing is just, I love it.  I love it.  Even in a tape, you can see the cops laughing.  That's the funniest part.  The cops that are slowly walking over to the melee that's happening by the newsman, 
[00:30:30]  you see them shaking their head and laughing like, oh, boy, it's like a mic.  You know, I've got to say, though, this is only the second best wowing that you've been part of.  Number one is still where you check the report live.  Oh, and the sidewalk is icy in front of the Letterman studio.  They keep running up at the wow sign, tried to stop, and slid right into the report live on the air.  And then the newsman, the doors flung open like the SWAT van.  They all came out and piled on top of them. 
[00:31:00]  So now there's a fight while the guy's trying to do a live broadcast.  It amazes me how angry these people get at a friggin' sign behind their reporter.  Oh, man.  Wow.  They lose it.  The new wow sign looks great, I've got to tell you.  Yeah, come on up.  It shows up really well.  It's got Opie and Anthony on it, N.E.W. on it, even upside down.  Yeah, even upside down.  Wow, that's really funny.  What a story.  I think he's on his way in so we could grill him about this. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, he should be here any more.  You should see the scars on him from the pavement.  Oh, really?  Well, when the cops take you down and put you on the pavement, they don't care that it's  pavement.  They're going to squish your face into it, put the neck, put the knee into the neck.  That's it.  Well, they had him good.  It was really funny.  Oh, that is too friggin' funny.  I feel bad for the poor reporter, though.  Boy, we've goosed him.  How many times has he been goosed?  Second time.  That's the second time Marvin's been pounded by a wow sign. 
[00:32:00]  Dude, he's going to have to, every time he does a live broadcast now, he's going to be  looking over his shoulder left and right.  No one is safe.  Well, here's the danger.  The wow thing's going to go to the next level now because we got in today 170,000 wow stickers.  Brand new wow stickers.  Not the lousy little window clings we had last time.  These are authentic stickers.  You can stick them virtually anywhere, Opie.  Yeah, they're big.  You're going to love these damn things.  Bright. 
[00:32:30]  They have an attitude to them.  Good job.  If you want to be the first person with a wow sticker and you're in the area, we're  going to be outside the Brooklyn Diner all day just handing these damn things out to  our listeners.  Handing them out.  And when we celebrate tonight, because we had a pretty damn good ratings book, possibly  at a strip club.  We're still trying to find out.  We'll bring a ton of wow stickers down there as well, okay?  You know something?  What?  You can't even almost promise a strip club that you cannot deliver. 
[00:33:00]  Once you say it, you have to do it.  Like, what are we going to do?  Oh, it was going to be a strip club, but this is good, an English pub.  How about Chuck E. Cheese?  We could play some darts instead of looking at big naps.  I mean, come on.  Now we're going to have to deliver.  What about our ten female listeners, though?  They're going to be dancing.  Yeah.  All right.  So, that's a great story.  Brand new wow stickers, too.  Of course, you guys know what to do.  You've got to get the wow on TV. 
[00:33:30]  Psycho Mark risking his life at this point to get the wow on TV.  You're like on America's Most Wanted.  I couldn't believe it.  They see you coming out, too.  It's so funny.  They all know who you are.  It's hilarious.  They're so scared.  A lot of the news crews have now taken to doing the broadcast from the top of the vans.  Yeah.  They park in Times Square, climb up onto the top of the van.  It's pretty cool.  When it's a chick, you can look right up her skirt.  Why don't you make that up while you're doing your makeup?  All right.  Who's going outside with the brand new wow stickers? 
[00:34:00]  Psycho Mark?  Psycho Mark?  You've got to meet your public.  They're going to want to high-five you.  Say hi to everyone's favorite felon, Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark will be right outside.  The Brooklyn Diner there.  57th and 7th, sort of.  Right there, right?  Lee Harvey Mark.  Lee Harvey Mark.  Jesus Christ.  The president and vice president are right there.  The Secret Service everywhere last night.  Did you see all the Secret Service?  Dude, it was insane.  Cops everywhere.  Plain clothes.  Uniform. 
[00:34:30]  The big Suburbans cruising up and down the road.  Oh, yeah.  It was unbelievable.  And Psycho Mark chooses to make a disturbance.  Put it this way.  Put it this way.  If you were down by Battery Park making a disturbance, Secret Service would have found you.  That's how many.  Psycho Mark, yards away from the hotel that the president is at.  You could see the hotel in the shot.  It's in Sheridan, right there in the shot.  He was still inside at that point?  Yeah, he was still inside.  You are nuts.  In Psycho Mark.  I should have ran around with an RPG. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  See how fast you would have been dead.  Well, you're living up to your name there.  Stop.  Someone's going to do it.  At least you would have done it during the fall or the spring ratings book.  Yeah, right.  If you're going to get shot by Secret Service, please do it now during this.  All right, so you're going to take a pile of these Brand New Wow stickers down outside,  outside the Brooklyn Diner.  We're going to be out there off and on all day long with them.  Be the first one on your block with them.  Be the first one to put one on Marvin Scott's head.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:35:30]  Poor Marvin.  I think Marvin's the one that deserves the A-bomb.  Don't you think?  Three's the charm, man.  Marvin Scott doing his news broadcast when, oh, no, up in the sky.  Why, look, it's the Anomal Day.  A silver fuselage glistening in the sun as the bomb bay doors open.  And you'll see the triangle of death, the atomic bomb, you know, baby.  Well, dude, the best part was the camera that ran away.  If I had stood behind him, there would have been no one to chase me. 
[00:36:00]  I could have grabbed Marvin and gave him my...  Dude, you know what?  Perfect.  Get this.  Next time, when you have Stinky, the cameraman chases him, you take the camera.  Yes!  And start chasing the cameraman.  And then, no, tape him chasing Stinky.  What I would do is just, you know, play cameraman.  And just, like, you know, focus on Marvin Scott's crotch while he's still trying to do his live show.  Hey, look at the balls in his pants.  Yeah.  Can we see your stuff? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  That is very good.  What a pisser.  All right.  So, what time will you be out there?  Like, in ten minutes?  Yeah, we'll head down there in about quarter to four.  Quarter to four, if you want...  The brand new wow sticker.  They just came in.  I mean, we're opening the boxes as we speak here.  Yeah.  Outside the Brooklyn Diner, it's like 57th and 7th.  Very psyched.  These things got attitude.  They really do. 
[00:37:00]  They really do.  So, we'll be out there starting at quarter to four.  And stay tuned for when we announce where we're going to be after the show.  Yeah.  Are we allowed to do it?  Not yet.  Yeah.  Who are you checking with?  That's a couple minutes.  We're working on it.  All right.  We just want to give people, you know, time to join us.  They'll have enough time.  Don't worry.  All right.  Window clings.  I want to make wow valve stem caps.  You screw them on your tires. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  And as we go to break here, it's the lies of steel.  Oh, yeah.  People love this little thing.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Now squirm in your seats.  Come on, squirm.  And deny.  Two, three, four.  Deny.  Two, three, four.  Deny.  Looking good, people.  Get fit for deception with Bill Clinton's lies of steel.  All right, people.  Lie.  Lie.  Lie.  When your bold-faced lies go bad and you're feeling the burn, Bill feels your pain and helps 
[00:38:00]  you shed unwanted sincerity and unsightly self-respect.  And you'll lose more than that.  Just listen.  I used to have a lot of trust and credibility, but not anymore.  The second I put in the Bill Clinton workout video, that all went away.  Lies of steel.  It shrinks accountability in just four short hours.  But wait, there's still more.  Listen to this special offer.  Order my four-hour videotape, Lies of Steel, and get the joy of phone sex absolutely free.  Lies of steel.  All right, let's see your smirks. 
[00:38:30]  Smirk.  One, two, three.  Smirk.  A spooge production.  Deny.  Deny.  Deny.  Hey, Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Yes.

How are you, buddy? 
[00:41:00]  You're live on the radio, man.  Cool, bud.  You guys just got okay, terrific on the people's court.  When they go out into the street and ask the schlups what they think about the court case.  Yeah.  Oh, the live little thing they do out on the street, yeah.  Yeah, when there's always the Indian guy and the old guy with no teeth here.  So, yeah, they asked this guy, and he said, hey, they did an okay, terrific job.  Okay, terrific.  Come up, come down.  There you go.  Ah, cool, man.  Thanks, Joe.  Hi, brother.  Hi.  Part of our language now, isn't it? 
[00:41:30]  Yes, it is.  Paul, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  You just did an okay, terrific on the people's court.  Yeah.  Okay, terrific.  Everyone's calling in with that, man.  They went to the street?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's messed up.  Everybody's singing now.  Okay, terrific.  Okay.  He did an okay, terrific job.  Thank you, Paul.  Okay, guys, stop.  All right, man.  Also, reports coming in, there's a WOW on MTV, TRL, once again, we struck.  A huge white sign with red letters.  Cool.  Nice.  Chris from Jersey letting us in on that one. 
[00:42:00]  Speaking of WOW, we got the brand-new WOW stickers in today.  Very excited.  Very proud of these stickers.  These are the stickers we want you guys to have.  Those are the ones we wanted the first time around, but they went with those dopey color  form window clings that no one put on their cars, because they sucked.  They sucked.  You couldn't see them.  A lot of people now have SUVs with tinted back windows, or the cars with tinted back windows.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, this shows an attitude, and we want everyone to have them.  Matter of fact, Psycho Mark is leaving the building within the next few minutes with the 
[00:42:30]  first batch of WOW stickers.  He's handing them out on the streets of New York.  He's going to be outside the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th, so if you're in the area, please  stop by and get yourself a sticker, okay?  Absolutery.  And then a little later today, we're still trying to work out the details, but we want  to have a beer with you guys.  Mm-hmm.  We found out that we just killed in the ratings.  Thank you.  Number one in all the main demos, the demos that matter most to us.  Yes.  Men, 18-34. 
[00:43:00]  Number one.  Men, 18-49.  Number one.  Men, 25-54, number one.  Rock.  Thanks to the ladies, too.  Yeah.  I mean, really.  I mean, you know.  We know you're out there, but...  We know.  We hear you.  I think we're in like 40th place with the ladies.  We're not going to lie to you.  Well, there's some...  What's a format that does well with ladies?  Like the Ricky Martin music.  I don't insult the ladies that listen to the show, because they are the cool ones. 
[00:43:30]  I understand.  Man, I'm talking about the ones that show up in the ratings, the majority of the ladies  listen to...  Like a hot 97.  Right.  And, you know, those type of stations.  Yeah.  It's very hard to get an equal number of men and women to listen to this type of program.  We understand when we're pouring hot wax over, you know, hot bodies that maybe the ladies  are going to go try to find a Ricky Martin song or something.  Celine or something.  Right.  We understand that.  But God bless you guys.  You're right there with us.  Yes, you are.  In huge numbers. 
[00:44:00]  Thank you.  Third book in a row that we've been number one, I believe.  So we're going to take it to the streets after the show.  Yeah.  And we're going to go to a bar.  Strip club.  Strip club.  Come on.  Give me a break.  We're going to be great.  Right after the show at 7 o'clock.  Oh.  You've got to act fast, though, because the place is going to fill up very, very fast.  Yeah.  So, uh, downtown.  Anyway.  Downtown.  Oh, look at Ben's freaking out.  What? 
[00:44:30]  Ixnay.  I just said downtown.  Downtown.  Take the downtown train.  You got knocked the head out.  West side.  Shut up.  What?  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Be quiet, sir.  Be quiet, sir.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  I don't know.  We'll all find out.  We'll all find out.  Okay.  Yeah, Scotso. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Come on down, Scotso.  Coming.  Scotso, will you be with us?  Coming.  Anyway, did Psycho Mark leave the building with the brand new wow stickers?  Mark.  Bring a cell phone with him, too.  Actually, if you're waiting for Mark to show up downstairs with the brand new wow stickers,  he's leaving in a couple minutes.  57th and 7th, outside the Brooklyn Diner.  But we got to get Stinky in here.  The second part of the wow story from last night.  Dude, you got to see the battle scars.  Yeah, let's see Stinky.  Wow. 
[00:45:30]  Let's see the part.  Whoa.  Oh, nice.  Look at his neck.  Yeah.  Is that where the knee was or where they grabbed you around the neck?  He's got road rash all over.  How many cops did you have on you at one point?  Like, at least three or four.  It was like Rodney King.  Lift the mic up.  Yeah, that's a pretty large number of cops for a white guy to have on him.  We probably have a lot of people tuning in for the first time here.  We discussed it for about 20 minutes already.  But last night on Channel 11, poor Marvin Scott was doing a live shot from outside the Sheridan 
[00:46:00]  where Clinton and his wife and Al Gore were having a little fundraiser.  Do you know how high security is when you have the president and vice president in the same place?  Because if that happens, if something happens to both of them, well, then you're screwed.  So they, I mean, they are unbelievable on the security.  So Psycho Mark and Stinky think it's a good time to start wowing the cameras, the news crews, causing any kind of a scuffle.  You know how, like, pumped up the cops are in that situation?  So that when they see a scuffle and people running and chasing, to them it might as well just be running toward the hotel yelling, 
[00:46:30]  Allah! Allah, I'm back!  You know, with a satchel bomb or something.  Yeah.  But no, it's just lovable goof-offs with wow signs.  Yeah, Psycho Mark and then...  So the cops just didn't take this one lightly.  They pounced.  And this is just how stupid our show is in general.  Well, Psycho Mark gets away with the wowing live on Channel 11 with Marvin Scott. 
[00:47:00]  First one, it was a textbook wowing.  Marvin Scott goes live shot.  Ben is home on his phone.  Tells Psycho Mark, all right, he's live now, go.  Psycho Mark comes up with a wow sign.  Wows the camera.  Marvin Scott gets taken again.  We all have a good laugh.  Cameraman chases after Psycho Mark.  Mark retreats across the street.  Successful wowing.  No one's hurt.  No worse for wear.  Do they leave it at that?  No.  Marvin comes back for another live shot.  Stinky comes running across the street, wow sign upside down. 
[00:47:30]  The cameraman bolts after him.  This time...  He almost got hit by that car.  Let's not forget that.  Catches him.  Stinky, I've got to ask you this.  When you ran away from the cameraman and you were running down the street,  why in God's name did you double back and come back towards the scene of the crime?  Because the guy was chasing me and I saw all these cops and I ran past the cops thinking they were going to stop it and they didn't.  So I just circled around and tried to come back to where the cops were. 
[00:48:00]  Well, you thought the cops were going to help you?  A lot of them love the show, but they do have a job to do.  Stinky, listen.  The camera guy's not really going to go too far.  He's got a job to do.  You're pretty tall.  I would imagine you're a fast runner.  Was the camera guy gaining on you?  Yeah, he was.  He looked like a gazelle.  The guy wouldn't let up, though.  I ran at least a block down.  I thought he'd stop because the camera was rolling and everything, but he kept going.  I didn't know.  And then I hear Mark come running down the street. 
[00:48:30]  Run, Stinky, just run!  Run, Forrest, run!  If you notice the guy's catching you, you've got to turn around and just act crazy to him.  Come on, bring it on, mother of a...  You know, stuff like that, and then he'll, like, back off.  All right.  That would have worked.  I got to ask the obvious question.  How stoned were you guys?  All right.  All right.  That's a good question.  Mess up.  Mess up.  No comment.  No comment.  Okay.  Blowing doobies near the president.  Hey, can I have a poke?  Come on, I won't inhale. 
[00:49:00]  Come on.  Hey, can I join you in your way?  Because you guys obviously weren't thinking straight.  To strike twice is just crazy.  Let's go this way.  We had a few beers in us.  A few beers.  The president and vice president were yards away.  Yards away.  And you're making a scuffle in a zone that is like a war zone.  There were more cops on that square a block than anywhere probably in the world at that given moment. 
[00:49:30]  And I'm serious.  I'm not even exaggerating.  At that moment, more cops there than anywhere on the face of the globe.  And you two idiots decide it's time to push you luck.  So now, Stinky, you double back.  And the camera guy sticks his foot out and trips you.  You do a header into the Channel 11 news fan.  Right into the tire.  That is classic.  You trip yourself.  He grabbed the back of my neck and tried to pull me down. 
[00:50:00]  I went forward to get him off of me.  And we fell to the ground.  And before I know it, a cop's knee is in my groin telling me to turn my groin.  In your groin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They hogtied you?  Well, they had me.  They had my face against the asphalt, my hands behind my back.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's what the cut of my neck's from.  I had a little, like, wrap.  He was all scabbed up.  What, did he have, like, an arm around you and stuff?  Yeah.  And everything.  And what was he saying to you?  Stay down, you know.  Stay down!  He started patting me. 
[00:50:30]  There's a single look on his face.  His face was on the paper.  I'm just trying to, wow, it's a joke.  They thought I stole the sign.  What's all the commotion?  Where did all these officers come from?  It's like the scene from Trading Places.  Eddie Murphy.  Eddie Murphy.  He comes out from underneath the table.  And he's like, good evening, obviously. 
[00:51:00]  I'm exactly the same scene.  Sneaky's face was just guns pointing at him.  One wrong move, it's all over.  Oh, my God.  We're obviously sending the clip right over to Steve from the unofficial Open Anthony website,  foundrymusic.com.  You don't get to see all that, but you get to see what happened on live TV. 
[00:51:30]  The funniest is the laughing cops chasing the scene right out of the camera angle.  And Marvin, what a professional, continued his whole broadcast like nothing ever happened.  That guy is amazing.  He ought to be given a lot of credit for that.  And we finally attacked a station that we don't own.  That's good.  I don't see us getting in trouble for this one.  Marvin, we bought Channel 11 this morning.  Outlive it.  Here's your new boss, Marvin Scott.  Well, we did use the Channel 2 man for cover. 
[00:52:00]  An accomplice.  You guys are out of your friggin' minds, man.  Can I tell you what a rush that was?  I bet.  You're walking away.  We go down to the train, blessing myself the entire way, going, holy Jesus, thank you,  thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Jesus.  And it was just like, it was like we just did about four shots of heroin in the air.  Oh, my, the adrenaline was pumping.  Antoine, what's up?  Thank God Stinky didn't take out his wallet. 
[00:52:30]  Jesus.  We actually did have to take our wallets out because they wanted ID.  That's never good.  Good thing Black Earl wasn't with you.  Oh, man.  Could have been a different outcome.  I didn't find that big bag of weed out.  Oh, my God.  You idiot.  All right, listen, that's very good. 
[00:53:00]  Good story.  Look at the scabs on Stinky.  Lift up that right arm again.  That's a good one.  He's a professional.  That's great.  Oh, my God.  Stinky's finally earned his colors.  Drop the wow sign.  Put your hands on your head.  This is the United States Secret Service.  What are you two idiots doing?  Yeah, take the skinny one.  Put your knee right in his throat.  And the goofy stomped one. 
[00:53:30]  Take him down.  My God, I can smell it from up in this chopper.  He breathed.  That smelled like good pot.  What do you mean to get that?  You're out of your minds, man.  Oh, that rocks.  Well, we encourage the wow signs on live TV, but just don't hurt anyone.  Maybe when the president's back at the White House.  Yeah, we don't want anyone to get hurt, obviously. 
[00:54:00]  One question.  What if you guys would have gotten busted?  Forget it.  Well, it'd be run through the system.  Like, I mean, I don't think there's anything they can really do.  Mind if we dance with your dates?  I'm just wondering about anything that may have been on their person.  Well, that's a whole different story.  Now we talk, you know.  Like, why?  I don't even understand what you're talking about.  Yeah, man.  Jesus.  No contraband.  No, it's just me and myself and I.  All the others.  All right, listen.  That is great stuff.  You guys. 
[00:54:30]  All right, go outside with the brand new wow stickers.  People are waiting outside there.  All right.  We got the brand new wow stickers in today.  We want to start handing them out.  They're really cool.  They're going to be all over the tri-state area within a week or two.  How would you like them all by a lot?  Huh?  But if you want to be the first on your block with one, we got Psycho Mark and Stinky leaving the building.  Hi, I'm Stinky.  Want a wow sticker?  Oh.  They'll be outside the Brooklyn Diner.  Stop by if you're in the area.  We'll be out there all afternoon handing them out, okay? 
[00:55:00]  All right.  57th and 7th.  And I guess we'll be back in a little bit.  All right.  That is some funny stuff.  Very funny, man.  I can't believe these guys.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  I hear there's quite a crowd outside the building, Anthony.  Yeah.  We have Psycho Mark outside with the brand new wow stickers that came in today.  They're going to be all over the tri-state area within a week or two.  But if you want them today, just head to the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th. 
[00:55:30]  We'll be out there for the rest of the show.  I think Earl and Psycho Mark and Stinky are going to be taking turns handing out stickers.  Yeah.  Hopefully we'll talk to Psycho Mark in a second or two here.  All right.  Brand new wow sticker.  Very attractive.  This is the one we wanted from the start.  Not the one that was concocted by the old regime that was here.  Right.  It was blue.  So these are the new ones.  We have, I don't know, literally what?  A quarter million of these things to give out? 
[00:56:00]  Pretty close.  170,000.  Oh.  Came in today.  Nice.  We want everyone to take 10.  10 each.  Hey.  What's this guy up here?  Psycho Mark, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Yeah.  I've just gone through a thousand stickers easily.  Get out of here.  I swear to God, people are coming up left and right down here for stickers.  It's insane.  Cool.  I walked out the door and there was at least 30 or 40 people screaming and yelling.  And just waiting for stickers.  All right.  You guys going to be hanging out outside the diner for a while? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Some guy just handed me a cigar, so I'll sit out here and smoke it, and we'll hand out  stickers and have fun.  All right.  It's Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th.  Psycho Mark's there right now with the brand new Wow stickers.  All right, Marky.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  There you go, Psycho Mark.  Let's go to Debbie on line three.  Debbie, what's up?  Hey, you a-holes.  Hey.  All right.  I've been listening to you guys for more than a year.  Yeah.  Okay?  I think I deserve a little respect.  I have a big sense of humor.  I love your guy's show. 
[00:57:00]  You crack me up every day.  I don't know what to say.  I think I deserve a little respect.  Well, we didn't say that there are no ladies listening.  Oh, but you kind of preshawed the idea.  Well, we said there are a lot more guys listening to the show than ladies, and we're trying to,  Debbie, trust me, Ant and I would love, love to have a ton more women listeners.  You think we want to hang out with 1,000 guys and 10 girls when we do these shows?  Yeah, you guys need to be having a pecker party constantly.  That's why we have to bring the girls on stage to make sure it's still cool. 
[00:57:30]  Some of my friends don't listen to you.  They hate the idea of what I put you guys on in the car.  They can't stand it.  Yeah.  But the reason is because you don't apologize for anything, you know?  Well, why?  It's like...  We don't like apologizing.  We just say what we have to say and see what happens.  Yeah, and I think you're the way, because I know you guys don't really think the way  you say things, and it's just for a joke, for ratings.  It's great.  I love it.  The official line.  I'm glad you see it that way. 
[00:58:00]  You a-hole.  Anyway, I want to put my input in, let you know that we are out here.  We understand you ladies are out there.  Why do you think we're doing this wow promotion?  This wow promotion would not work if we didn't have lady listeners.  Yep.  Exactly.  So we acknowledge you.  We bow to you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And maybe one day you'll see my 34 Cs.  Oh, very nice.  Well, thank you, Debbie.  Take care.  All right, cool.  Of course, ladies, we know you're out there.  Yeah, we know you're out there. 
[00:58:30]  But I hope you don't mind if we throw a little ratings party at a strip club tonight.  Angela.  Hey, guys.  Hi, what's up?  I'm a little, I agree with Debbie.  Yeah.  And I'm a little upset that you guys are going out there, because I would love to come out  and hang out.  You could come.  Well, okay, yeah.  I encourage the ladies to join us at the strip club.  I promise you won't be harassed.  It's the safest place for you to be tonight.  Yeah.  Because when we're at a regular bar and the guys need to see something, who do they turn  to? 
[00:59:00]  The girls that are there.  The girls that are there.  The girls that have shown up.  It actually makes sense for the ladies to show up at the strip club, because you won't  be bothered.  Not only that, this is a great opportunity for those ladies that may have wanted to go  to a strip club in the past, but didn't have the balls, or didn't really feel it was appropriate  to walk into a strip club.  If I can sugarcoat it any way you want, that's fine.  But the bottom line is that most of us are going to feel still a little bit uncomfortable.  And when you ladies make us number one in the girl demos, we'll throw a party of trippin' 
[00:59:30]  dance.  Only but surely.  But I'll tell you, until then, it's movie bars.  Well, Angela, we wanted to do something real close to the station, but this is what we got,  and we're going to go with it.  All right.  So then, give the girls a little incentive to get there, then.  That's all I'm saying.  I really hope a lot of ladies show up.  Yeah, but incentive.  You know something?  And I'm serious about that.  A lot of girls are leery about just going to a strip club.  This is a great opportunity, because it's for our show.  It's not something like you're just walking into a strip club, and you've got to feel weird 
[01:00:00]  about it.  But then how do you get your friends to come with you?  Hey, guys, I'll go to a strip club to see O.B. and Anthony.  Like, that's a little...  I think a group of girls would have a good time.  It's kind of fun.  You could watch us all act like idiots drooling over these girls.  Yeah.  It's a bit unorthodox, but that's fine.  All right.  All right, maybe.  All right, Angela.  If not, we'll see you at the next one.  We do these things all the time.  Well, hopefully.  All right?  All right.  All right, Angela.  Take care.  In our defense, you know, this is the first time we've ever tried to do anything at a 
[01:00:30]  strip club.  Right.  You know, as far as the listeners are concerned.  Patricia.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Love you guys.  I want to congratulate you for being number one.  And I agree with the previous girls, you know, as far as, you know, she catered to the  women more.  Because you do have female listeners out there who have a little off-the-wall sense  of humor.  We know you're there, yeah.  We're just not number one with them.  But I just want to tell the girl who was just on before, I've been to strip clubs as  a, you know, not a participant because I have small boobs. 
[01:01:00]  Boobs, Opie.  Boobs.  Boobs.  And you know what?  All we have to do is say, hey, guys, you know, you see any of the female listeners  at the strip club after the show tonight, be cool.  Yeah.  And they'll be cool.  It's fun to go.  I just want to let your female audience know that there's nothing wrong with it.  You have to be secure within your womanhood to accept that woman with, you know, the  great bodies.  And whether you have one or not, I just think it's a lot of fun to go and be just enjoying  and have a few drinks.  Look at the big boobs.  You didn't used to work here, did you? 
[01:01:30]  Why do you say that?  You just remind me of someone.  Oh, listen, guys, you know, with the stickers, if I send you my name and address, can I get  some in the mail?  Oh, that's a very good question.  Yes.  Self-addressed stamped envelope.  We'll send the stickers out immediately.  Uh-huh.  The address is very simple.  Just write WOW, WNW, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  10106.  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  Self-addressed stamped envelope, and we'll send it out immediately. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, great.  All right, Patricia.  Oh, look, look.  One more thing.  Oh.  She's using up all of our...  Oh, real quick.  Just mind, Siri, why...  Oh, just one more thing.  Just one, why Donna Hanover doesn't, you know, she's not with her husband all the time.  Yeah.  It all happened since the affair that he supposedly had with that woman on his staff.  Yeah, we don't know anything about that.  Okay, I get your drift.  Okay.  All right.  All right, Patricia.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, can we announce a place where we're going to have a beer with our listeners? 
[01:02:30]  Can we?  Better wait for Ben.  He's the guy.  We have to wait for Ben?  Yeah.  I think we've got it all straight now, right?  I would rather wait for Ben.  We need...  When I see Ben nod his head and say...  Because he's the guy that handles the bar.  All right.  Wow.  Did Rick just walk out miffed?  No.  Because I was going over his head and going to Ben?  He's looking for Ben, I think.  Or is he pissed?  Because he said, you know, no, it's okay.  And I'm saying no.  Well, I'd rather hear it from Ben.  Right.  Because I know Ben is the guy that's on the phone with these places. 
[01:03:00]  Well, this is what we want to do.  And it's turning into something completely different.  We did pretty well in the ratings.  Yeah.  We did very well in the ratings.  And we want to thank you guys again.  It is the People's Radio Show.  You guys are a big part of this, obviously.  Very happy.  So Ant and I said, hey, let's just go out and buy our listeners a beer.  One beer for each listener.  Until we run out of money.  So anyway, a few clubs came to the table and they want to help us out. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  And one's a strip club and I think that's where we're going.  Right after the show.  Right at 7 o'clock.  7.15.  Who's the show that gives you boobs?  Who takes you to the strip club?  Okay.  Here's the deal.  All right.  Rick's in the studio.  It's about five or ten minutes.  Yeah.  We're just waiting for some paperwork to be signed and signed.  See?  And we're good.  Good.  All right.  Let me make sure. 
[01:04:00]  There's going to be no cover charge for our listeners, right?  Oh, that would be a serious problem.  I really don't think so.  Yeah.  Let's make sure of everything because we can't have that.  This is what, it's simple.  We're giving this place a ton of advertising.  Obviously, no one at the strip club at 7 o'clock on a Tuesday night.  Yeah.  The place is going to be packed.  It's a good opportunity to expose the club to a lot of people that will be coming in. 
[01:04:30]  We're holding out.  No cover charge for our listeners.  We can't charge these people for that.  The girls will make out.  No cover until you can set a time.  I don't care.  But no cover charge.  You've got to allow our listeners to get in there for free.  Yeah.  And Ant and I have to be able to buy a ton of first-round beers.  Yeah.  Right.  That's it.  That's all we're asking for.  Until that happens, we're holding out, Anthony.  Yeah.  We have to.  So our listeners have been screwed over more times than I could count. 
[01:05:00]  Okay.  Here comes Rick back into the studio.  Okay.  Okay.  What?  It's not bad news.  It's good news.  All right.  All right.  We're just waiting for the papers to be sent back, but one of the stipulations is no cover  charge.  No cover charge.  Well, they just see it as a formality.  They could set a time, though, because I understand they have regular business to do.  That's fine.  And our listeners don't need a lot of time to get there and get in for free.  I would say no cover up until eight would be more than reasonable.  At eight, if they want to start charging, then that's fine. 
[01:05:30]  We've at least warned our listeners.  Right?  Exactly.  That sounds good.  Because, I mean, as soon as we announce this within, like, ten minutes, you know, people  are going to start heading down immediately.  Right.  Immediately.  All right.  What are we waiting for?  They're going to fax it back?  Fax paperwork with a signature.  Downtown Westside, though?  It looks like it could be that area.  You're such idiots.  Natasha.  Hold on a second. 
[01:06:00]  Hello?  Hold on a second, Natasha.  They find something very funny.  Well, yesterday we were taking the Elian Gonzalez capture picture and putting captions and  kind of screwing with the picture, adding in your own faces and stuff.  Somebody put the Elian Gonzalez band.  Look.  The cop with the gun is now holding a guitar, and Elian is screaming into a microphone.  That is classic, man.  Send that off to Steve. 
[01:06:30]  That one gets sent to Steve.  What you guys got to do, if you're sending really good ones, you got to send them off to  Steve, because he'll put it on the unofficial website.  Foundrymusic.com.  I sent one to Steve today that's hilarious.  Remember the picture of me with the really wacky, stupid glasses?  Yeah, the big, thick glasses.  That I said I had to wear after my laser surgery?  Yeah.  They're ridiculous.  Looking glasses?  You didn't really have to wear.  I looked like, where's Waldo, because then I have my, you know, winter hat on?  Yeah.  Well, now that face of me is on the gunman. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, the guy from the INS.  Right.  So I'm pointing the gun at Anthony, who's holding a picture of himself.  Yeah, from my fur coat picture.  From your fur coat picture when you were, what, like nine or ten or whatever it was?  Yeah.  So you're holding yourself.  I'm the guy with the gun.  You got a picture of Spaz peeking out.  Peeking around the closet door.  Right.  There's a wow sticker on the closet door.  There's a cranky ass sign in the background.  There's a Ileon 316 sign in the background. 
[01:07:30]  And then, you know, in the famous picture, there's another INS agent coming into the area?  Yeah.  Now, the head on that guy is Ziggy.  Ziggy.  From the homeless shopping spree.  It is hilarious.  Yeah, that is a really good one.  I hope Steve got it.  That's funny.  I got to say this.  If you're the guy that put that together, you might want to send it to Steve just to make sure he gets it,  because I'm not sure if my email was going through today, okay?  All right, now let's go back to Natasha. 
[01:08:00]  Natasha.  Hold on one second.  All right.  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm here.  I was just taking another call.  All right.  What's up, Natasha?  Listen, it's about time I got through to you guys, man.  Yes.  Yes.  What station were you listening to before us?  Hot 97.  It sounds like that.  Hot 97.  CD 101.9.  Oh, we kicked their ass in the ratings.  Yeah.  I mean, oh, my God.  I can't believe.  Let me tell you.  You're a hoochie mama.  I am.  Yes.  And I live right in the heart of the ghetto.  What?  I'm just saying. 
[01:08:30]  What?  For real.  For real.  No, but.  You know what we had to do to beat Hot 97?  Mm-hmm.  Double digits, Opie.  Oh.  But I want to go to the strip show tonight.  Well, then just come.  Where is it at?  I just.  No.  We can't announce it.  We're waiting for them to, you know, cross the T's and dot the I's.  Oh, come on.  They sent off a little contract to this place.  No, no.  Because we want to make sure our listeners don't have to pay a cover charge.  Okay.  But we want to make sure a lot of them get the first beer on Aunt Nye. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, okay.  Because I think it would be rather interesting to see me there.  I mean.  Just show up.  I'm a West Indian and I'm listening to Opie and Anthony and the radio chick.  I got all my friends listening to you guys.  There you go.  My boss is like, are you still listening to them people?  I'm like, yes.  He's like, every time you listen to them, you mess up your paperwork.  Hey, we got to congratulate the radio chick.  She had a little bump up in the ratings, too.  Bravo.  She's starting to show some serious signs that the show's working and we want to congratulate her as well. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, there's the hallways today?  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Life.  Life.  I'll be there tonight.  I'm going to keep listening.  I got to answer my phones.  They're ringing like crazy.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  We'll see you there.  All right.  We hope the ladies aren't scared and they come join us after the show tonight.  Okay?  Yes.  N.E.W. is like, you ever see those historical things about the earth when it finally started  cooling down from when it was just lava?  Yeah.  That's what N.E.W. was for so long. 
[01:10:00]  Just a floating rock in space and then all of a sudden out of the water.  Oh, little life.  A little bit.  Little life formed and everyone's so excited.  Let's just put it this way.  Ed and I just lost our gills.  Yeah.  We're breathing air now.  We're breathing air, but we still look like half fish, half lizard.  Right.  Like we're just crawled out of the, uh, out of the water.  Remember that illustration in school?  Yeah.  But how does that happen?  How does a fish go from having gills to having lungs?  Yeah.  I can't wait till we're up to the, uh, evolutionary scale of at least like the Patrick Ewing guy. 
[01:10:30]  What?  Why?  Wow.  Wow.  You always have to take it a little too far.  I apologize.  Guys, yeah.  Water doodles.  Bone dry, yeah.  All right.  I guess we're going to have to take a break.  And can we announce the place after commercials?  No.  After commercials, maybe.  What do you mean maybe?  We've got to wait for the facts to come back. 
[01:11:00]  People are eagerly awaiting.  Well, if this club is listening, you've got the paperwork.  Facts it back.  You're wasting time.  We can promote this.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Diplomacy.  Do you understand that word?  Yeah, I understand.  Diplomacy.  You don't want to try to put them on the defensive or anything.  It's a relationship.  Okay.  We're very happy with each other and the work we have each done for the other.  Okay.  In other words, get the boobs out of your face. 
[01:11:30]  No.  There's something on your fax machine that you need to send back to him.  Are you happy with her large boobs?  No.  Opie.  That wouldn't be good either.  No, no, no.  What you do.  Yeah, come back to us.  Okay.  What you do is you say, guys, if you're listening from the club, we just faxed over some info.  Yeah.  When you have the time, please fax it back.  We are a little pressed for time, but I think we will all be happy with the turnout after today.  In other words, get your face out of the hair pie. 
[01:12:00]  Jesus.  Look at Ben.  He's freaking out.  How much longer, Ben?  Ben, I am waiting for the fax.  It's in the person's hand.  He's going to sign it, read over the agreement, and send it back.  Are we all clear with the cover charge?  There's no cover charge.  There will be a free buffet.  Free buffet?  Yes.  You guys nuts.  Wow.  So just relax.  You can tell the club, because I want to work with them.  I'm working on it.  I'm back there panicking.  I love these people. 
[01:12:30]  They've had a superb relationship with this show.  Certainly.  I will tell you that.  And please excuse Opie.  He's a guy that punches guests on this show.  So you really have to cut him some slack.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Calm down.  Breathe.  Take a breath with me.  There you go.  So get your ass out of the champagne room.  No?  What?  You jerk.  What happened?  Look, I thought we were all having fun.  Right.  No?  Oh, my God. 
[01:13:00]  We're all going to go down to McDonald's for a shake if Opie doesn't shut up.  You can tell them that they could charge a cover at a certain time.  Just give our listeners a few hours to get in there for free.  That's all we have to do.  You don't tell them anything.  What?  We make mutual suggestions for the benefit of all involved.  Oh, I see.  And before you know it, we're all having a good time.  And it's beneficial to everybody.  I see.  I'm sorry.  No hard feelings.  It's fun, fun, fun.  Right?  Right.  Ponderous. 
[01:13:30]  Effing ponderous.  All right.  I'm coming back to you.  Oh, it's that guy, like, like, oh, it's that guy, yeah, in the bar when, like, the fight  has been totally diffused, and you think you're in the clear, and he lunges his fist at the  one guy's face, and then it's on.  Everyone just piles in.  Oh, come on, man.  Diplomacy.  All right.  All right.  I understand.  Yeah.  I understand now, Anthony.  No, I'm cool, man.  I'm cool.  It's okay.  I'm cool.  I'm cool.  Fens lie down the hallway going, five minutes. 
[01:14:00]  Five minutes.  Five minutes.  Okay.  All right.  Everything's good.  Stay tuned.  We will announce where we will be after the show to buy a round of drinks for our pals,  a lot of the listeners of this show.  Until we run out of money, and that's going to happen fast, because even though the stock  market's doing better, it's not doing great.  I did all right yesterday.  Yeah.  But I'm a little unsure.  Like today, a lot of things went up, Ope. 
[01:14:30]  The way it used to be, I would dive in.  But tomorrow, everyone could take the profits off of this, so I kind of laid back.  Thank you.  Okay.  Stock advice from Anthony the Idiot.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  Are we still handing out the brand new Wow stickers outside the building?  Are we doing well with that, Matt?  Yep.  Doing well?  Yep.  I've heard we've gone through over a thousand already.  Is that true?  Dude's coming out of the woodwork.  Awesome.  Yeah.  If you want to be the first person on your block with the brand new Wow sticker, they're 
[01:15:00]  going to be available very soon all over the place.  But right now, they're available outside the building, 57th and 7th, outside the Brooklyn  Diner.  Okay?  Look for the two idiots smoking cigars.  That would be Psycho Mark and Stinky?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So if you want to head over there, you can get your stickers.  Okay?  Ha-ha!  He's a little on edge, Ope, today.  Ha-ha!  That's the recording, yes.  I was a little scared that an actual gun went off in the studio.  Okay, listen.  Calm down. 
[01:15:30]  We will announce the club that we're going to right after the show.  Ha-ha!  To celebrate with you guys right after these commercials, okay?  Pull your pants down.  Ha-ha!  You idiots.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Ha-ha!  We'll be back.  We'll be and answer me.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't speak to.  This is a fun part of it.  Stop! 
[01:16:00]  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  You'll love Paisano.  You know how we're going to celebrate after the show with the listeners?  We're going to announce the place in a little while here?  Yeah.  I really wanted to call up Joey and say,  Joey, what do you say, man?  We'll just push the tables aside and have a beer bash.  Well, let me tell you something.  Paisano, great place.  He's probably sitting there right now going,  yeah, I'd do that knowing him.  But I don't think it would be large enough for a lot of our listeners to be in there. 
[01:16:30]  I wouldn't be surprised if a few of us make it down to Paisano after we celebrate a little bit.  Then I'll say it right now, Joey, you're listening.  A separate table, separate check.  I want separate everything.  I want a wall built so I don't have to even try to put in money with the hangers on.  That'll be there.  With us.  That's right.  And I will not be there.  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  Table in the basement, please.  Paisano's great. 
[01:17:00]  We love it.  Great food.  Warm, friendly, relaxed atmosphere.  Portions, huge.  Prices, very reasonable.  And incredible pasta lunch specials, Hopi, which we don't talk about enough.  Yeah, after a year of advertising, we realized that, wow, he has great lunch specials, too.  You will love it.  You want to go down to Little Italy, you want to get some authentic Italian cuisine, Paisano on Mulberry Street. 
[01:17:30]  That's where you got to go.  That's the place.  Bypass all the other people that are trying to drag you into their restaurant.  Why do you think they put somebody out front, come, this one good, this good, good place, good place, try to drag you in?  You don't see that at Paisano because the place does fine by word of mouth in this program.  I rub it in, though.  When I walk down Mulberry, they're like, come in here, in here.  I'm like, no, I'm going to Paisano.  And then you can tell the guy's just pissed because he's seen his son of a bitch a hundred times. 
[01:18:00]  He's slammed the menu down on his leg.  What does a joey have?  You know what it's like?  You ever see that Bugs Bunny episode with the two little Italian guys, and they're trying to get bugs for the thing?  That's what a walk down Mulberry Street's like.  Come into mine.  I make it the best of rabbit stew.  Right, right.  I pinch your little red tomato nose.  Oh, brother.  That's what they like.  What are you cooking, Doc? 
[01:18:30]  He's in the pot.  He grabs the carrot.  Rabbit to cut your tori.  That's what they like.  All right, so it's Paisano of Mulberry Street.  You ask for Joey, say, hey, Joey, Opie and Anthony sent me.  What do I get?  And he'll say, well, you get a glass of wine on the house.  I'll be right back with your wine as you look at the menu, okay?  That's right.  Call 965-1188.  That's 965-1188 for reservations.  It's Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. 
[01:19:00]  I see some movement in the hallway.  It looks like Ben is walking down the hall.  I think we're going to finally be able to announce where we're going after the show tonight, Anthony.  Yes.  All right, stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Brilliant radio at its best.  Oh, God.  I want to smoke.  187-WN-N-O.  It's the O&H show.  Hey.  We announced it yesterday.  I want to announce it again.  A lot of people emailed me about this.  Limp Bizkit doing a free tour this summer with Cypress Hill. 
[01:19:30]  Multiple nights in New York to be announced along with venues.  Very, very cool.  We don't need to give away tickets to that one because it's free.  All right, Ben's walking down the hall, Anthony.  We're going to announce the club.  We're going to be partying at 7 o'clock right after the show tonight.  Yeah.  We did very well in the ratings, and we want to immediately thank you guys and have a few beers with you guys.  And we're going to, like, we're going to try to buy the first round for everybody.  Psycho Mark, what's up? 
[01:20:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  We have Psycho Mark outside the building.  There's so much stuff going on today.  The brand-new WOW stickers came in.  We're excited about that.  And if you want to be the first person to own one of these WOW stickers, Psycho Mark is outside the building,  outside the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th, with a ton of these stickers,  and people are stopping by to get them.  Right, Mark?  People are coming up left and right.  This guy shows up in a Rolls-Royce limo and jumps out to get a brand-new WOW sticker.  Nice.  It was a bonus.  It's great.  We've got a bunch of people standing out here.  We're haggling everybody. 
[01:20:30]  Everyone's doing Dr. Smith impressions.  And everyone's going, whoo!  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  I like the new sticker.  You know what you do?  You put it on a boy's behind, and all of a sudden they rip it off, and it's hairless.  Woo!  Who the hell are you going to ask me?  All right, guys.  We're done here.  We've got plenty of stickers, so come on by.  We're standing right out in front of the Brooklyn Diner.  And you guys are going to be there pretty much for the rest of the show?  I guess so. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  We're not going anywhere fast, that's for sure.  Hey, Mark, how much free weed are you getting?  I was right here.  I was right here.  I was right here.  I was right here.  Woo!  Dr. Smith just came by and gave me a boon.  Woo!  All right, Mark.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  There you go.  There's a Psycho Mark outside the building, 57th and 7th, outside the Brooklyn Diner with  the brand new wow sticker.  Hey, we have one of the cops on the line that was part of the whole Psycho Mark Stinky fiasco  outside the Sheridan. 
[01:21:30]  They got a wow sign on the 10 o'clock news on Channel 11 last night.  It was a complete mess.  Pandemonium.  They decided to make a ruckus right near the hotel that Clinton and Gore are at, so there's  cops everywhere.  Yeah.  And Stinky was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed.  And after a chase by the cameraman from Channel 11 News, Marvin Scott wowed again.  Yeah, poor guy.  All right, let's talk to Pete.  He was one of the cops on the scene last night.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys? 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Thanks for putting me on.  I just wanted to let you know, he wasn't handcuffed.  He wasn't handcuffed?  No, he wasn't handcuffed.  All right.  Steve?  But, you know, the reason I'm calling is my partner and I, we want our cigars back.  We lost them in the melee.  We figured Psycho Mark owes us a couple of stogies.  All right.  You should go see Psycho Mark.  He's outside the Brooklyn Diner right now.  He might have some stuff for you.  Yeah.  The funny thing was, after Stinky went down, you know, Psycho Mark just grabbed the sign.  He tried to run away and left his buddy hanging there.  Left him to the wolves.  Yeah, but you guys got him. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, wouldn't you at that point, though?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I thought I would have helped my buddy out.  I'll tell you what, though.  That guy ran pretty quickly.  Stinky?  No, the other guy.  Psycho Mark?  Yeah.  No, no, not Psycho Mark.  The newsman.  Oh, the camera guy.  Oh, the camera guy.  Yeah, he was on a full tilt from, like, the Marquis down to the Sheridan on the 51st.  He was full of being pissed off in what it was.  He had that pissed off energy.  He said, these two guys have been heckling me since the Westchester nuclear fiasco.  That's true.  He was tired.  That was the last time Marvin Scott got wowed, where somebody put a small sign the size of his face 
[01:23:00]  directly in front of his face as he was trying to do a live report.  It's not personal with him, though.  I mean, he's got the wrong idea.  I'll tell you what, though.  He said that he was pissed.  He's like, yeah, pretty soon they're going to start wowing us, and I won't have that.  Yeah.  Couldn't understand what his problem was.  Yeah, really.  That'll get the ratings up on Channel 11 News.  If girls, if you know, there'll be a live shot with girls' boobs.  Thank you.  Well, that's the next stage with this.  We're going to get girls getting their live boobs on.  You guys got them panicking, though.  You certainly have them panicking. 
[01:23:30]  And that isn't the atomic bomb, either.  Believe me.  That's just softening the beaches.  Right.  Wait for the atomic bomb.  It is going to be like nothing anyone has ever seen.  It's going to be like...  Flashy is rolling off the comet.  Colonel Tibbetts and his crew of the Enola Day.  I didn't even believe it was them.  I go, let me tell you.  Let me guess.  You guys are psychomarkers?  Yeah, we are.  Yeah.  Yeah, we are.  Could you please get your knee out of my throat?  I don't even work in Manhattan.  I was just spending a nice day at the detail trying to enjoy some white when we're keeping in it. 
[01:24:00]  So where do you work, man?  I work in Brooklyn in an undesirable, geographically undesirable area.  I'm cool, man.  That's funny.  That's funny, man.  Well, thanks for being cool.  We understand we put you guys in a good position.  I just want to let him know there's definitely no hard feelings.  Hey, you got to rough him up a little bit.  No, we didn't.  We didn't.  We really didn't.  I don't know.  Somebody roughed him up.  We didn't know that they did it the first time.  I was on a corner on the way of the whole first...  You know, this was the second time when he went running down. 
[01:24:30]  I think he could have got those injuries when the Channel 11 cameraman tripped him.  I want to know why...  ...and did a header into the news truck.  Yeah, that's what happened.  I mean, I want to know why he decided to do it in front of a lieutenant and an inspector.  That wasn't using his head.  What a tool.  They're not smart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks for taking the show, and congratulations with the new ratings.  Hey, thanks, Pete.  All right.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  It's so funny.  It's like, no, we didn't rough him up.  Now, relatively speaking, they didn't.  You know what I mean?  Like, roughing somebody up.  Oh, my God.  Forget about it. 
[01:25:00]  The guys would be all blown up, their eyes and stuff.  So that's nothing.  That's just keeping somebody down.  Chris says he was there last night as well.  Another cop.  Chris?  What's up, guys?  Were you really there?  I was there, man.  Big fans.  You guys understand what could have happened to your little buddies of mine?  Oh, we completely understand.  We said it.  There was Secret Service and everything all over the place.  Man, you guys, they picked the wrong night.  Yeah.  They picked the wrong night.  Thank God you got fans, though, the blue fans.  Yeah, we put you guys in a bad position last night. 
[01:25:30]  Because some of you guys on TV were laughing, and the others were like,  man, you know, the sergeant's right here.  We got to do something.  The lieutenant was there.  Oh, the lieutenant was there.  Yeah, we're big fans of the shovel.  And, you know, Clinton's in town.  Just do it there.  We just do it maybe in Jersey or Pennsylvania.  Yeah, we understand.  All right?  All right, man.  Have fun tonight, guys.  Thanks, Chris.  Later.  It's kind of true.  Yeah, it's like, come on.  It was the first time you had the Clintons and Gore at the same place at the same time in a long time.  Yeah.  First time in the city, anyway.  So, I mean, they were nothing but business last night. 
[01:26:00]  Not the time to do that.  And especially twice.  You got away with it once.  Consider yourself lucky.  Come back to the office.  Grab a beer and celebrate.  Right.  But no.  Let's do it again.  And Psycho Mark, you know, felt he did such a great job, he decided to take one of my Cubans off my desk.  All right.  Who's going to announce this?  It's not like you don't already know.  I know.  He's been teasing me, trying to make me have a heart attack down by the fax machine. 
[01:26:30]  All right.  Well, here's the deal.  If you're just tuning in.  The ratings came out.  We did really, really well.  And we really want to thank you guys.  And that's the God's honest truth.  We said it earlier, but we definitely want to thank Rick, our producer.  Ben, Stinky.  Wow, it sounds like an award show.  I know.  I'd like to thank our producer.  Well, you know, it's not just us.  There's so many people that help out with the show.  You know, there are so many people that help.  I want to run through a short list I have here.  All right.  All right.  Ben, you're wonderful. 
[01:27:00]  Oh.  No, just a couple more.  Rick, you're doing a great job.  Thank you so much.  Opie, you're great.  Psycho Mark, did I mention?  Thank you.  We'll be back with more of the 1999 Academy Awards after this.  Shut the F up music.  I know.  Of course, I want to thank Spaz and John.  Black Girl, of course, takes a lot of abuse. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  And Jimmy, who works behind the scenes and puts together a lot of the production for us.  Anyone else, Anthony?  I was just pounding you now.  Are you going to keep going?  Oh, yeah.  I want to thank our listeners.  I'd like to thank God.  God.  God.  I want to thank God.  My flip-mo squad.  And Maya Angelou said it best when she said...

Yeah, Psycho Patty for not shooting me yet.  Thank you.  Stalker Patty, I should say.  Psycho Patty.  Same thing.  Why, Art?  All right.  And Stinky.  And Stinky, yeah.  This man is love.  This man is love.  Oh, just a couple more at the end. 
[01:28:30]  Of course, Mom.  You've gotten me through so much.  And my sister.  I'm going to go make out with her right now.  Oh, that's Elyon Gonzalez.  Yeah, we're just having fun today.  They posted some of the numbers up there on the message board, Opie.  Yeah, basically.  Wow.  Well, the papers all called the radio show today, man.  They all wanted quotes from us.  We refused to talk to any of them. 
[01:29:00]  Boy, the men are right there.  Number one, men, 1834.  Number one, men, 1849.  Number one, men, 2544.  Number one, men, 1854.  And why not just wrap it up?  Number one, men, 18 plus.  That's amazing.  Thank you.  Where are the chicks?  Yeah, come on, ladies.  Hey, come on, girls.  Start telling more ladies about the radio show.  Tell your friends to turn off Hot 97 and start listening to us.  Maybe if we went to places besides strip clubs. 
[01:29:30]  Well, after you say you're number one, men, 18 plus, where do you think we should celebrate?  And we encourage the ladies to join us today.  You'll have fun.  You won't be harassed.  All right?  We'll just ogle at the girls on the stage.  Yeah.  That's it.  Ogle.  Good work.  Thank you.  And like I said earlier, if there are some girls that have been leery about going to  a strip club but always wanted to, what a better opportunity.  Now you have an excuse.  Okay. 
[01:30:00]  It's a little ratings party we're having.  All right.  So let's announce it here, Anthony.  What?  I just want to thank Old Dirty.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Louis Black, of course.  Stephen Lynch.  My close personal friend, Adam Ferrara.  And of course, Jay Moore.  What would a show be?  An opium.  We'll return with more.  We'll return with more.  I want to thank all the girls that have made it onto the lesbian couch, Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  Yes.  And the girls that have performed on the Blue Carp Cabaret.  Beautiful.  The one girl that got the hot wax dripped all over her fine body.  All right.  Friggin' awards show.  Seven o'clock tonight, we're going to be at Privilege.  Oh, there it is.  We want to thank our old boss for getting fired.  For leaving.  For leaving.  Giving us the chance to succeed.  What happened?

[01:31:30]  They're giving us a free buffet.  We didn't even ask for that, so we want to thank the guys at Privilege for doing that.  Nice.  And doors open at 5.  It's not a huge place, so I would definitely get down there early.  Right?  I think we could squeeze...  Well, I don't even want to give out the number, but it's, you know, not as big as, like, the Mulcahy's gig or anything like that.  Trust me on that.  Okay?  And, uh, yeah, this isn't a road show or anything we're doing.  No.  We're going down there to, uh, celebrate.  You people are, uh, right there with us.

[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  All right, Anthony, let's take a break.  Okay, Opie.  And, of course, thank you, Opie.  Tool.  And, lastly, I'd like to thank Opie.  If it wasn't this man, I would...  And, finally, we'll be back with more of this pompous, ponderous, effing ponderous bullcrop. 
[01:35:30]  Hi, I'm Casey Gingson.  And, I'd like to thank Don.  Where are those pictures I'm supposed to see?  All right, we've got to take a break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  How often do you get to listen to somebody's cell phone to somebody's uterus?  More stupidity on the way.  Hey, Anthony, stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner. 
[01:36:00]  Yes, Opie.  Stacker two, losing weight.  Who wants to lose weight?  Huh?  A lot of people.  Some are right around the corner, right?  Yeah, like really right around the corner now.  Starting to get nice out.  You're shedding those big, heavy clothes.  Mm-hmm.  It lasted a little longer than we thought, didn't it?  Yes, it did.  You thought you were safe.  Mm-hmm.  With your little pudge, didn't you?  Yes.  It's like, oh, thank God.  You went out of the house and it's like, oh, it's cold again and it's raining.

Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th.  Psycho Mark and Stinky out there.  They've gone through close to 2,000 stickers already, Anthony.  Well, this sticker is great.  It's not like the old one that we had put out by the old regime of bosses that were here.  This is a very, very good sticker. 
[01:39:30]  It's got attitude.  Yeah, it does.  I'm proud.  My brother did the design, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah, my brother.  A little nepotism.  Cool-o.  All right.  What the hell, right?  You know something?  Your brother helps us out with the show.  My brother helps out with the show.  Oh, we didn't thank them in our thank yous.  Oh, you better thank your brother and your sister.  And I'd like to thank Dawn, my brother Joe, and Cowbell Bill, of course, doing a fine job.  Joseph T. Curry. 
[01:40:00]  Fine job.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Look at that.  Salud.  Nothing better than some champagne in a paper cup.  Put that down.  Who are you?  Who are you?  What?  What?  What?  Did you spin this?  I'm going to call it a thud.  Sandy, you going to the strip club with us tonight?  I'm hoping to get a lap dance. 
[01:40:30]  Whoa.  My girlfriend going to the strip clubs.  So, guys, please don't fondle her.  Please.  No, you can fondle her.  That's fine.  Please.  Just make sure you take money, though.  Show my girlfriend your junk.  What?  Make sure I get paid for it.  Some dollar bills will be flying.  Man, we could pay rent, man.  Get liquored up on the champagne.  We'll get to the stage.  I'm going to turn that bitch out.  I plan on it.  I'm going to pimp you out tonight.  I hope he's pimping out his girl. 
[01:41:00]  Jesus.  I'm going to wear one tonight.  We better thank Air Sick or they're going to cry.  Pimp hands!  Because Jay Moore got thanked and not them.  Why did Jay Moore get thanked?  You're a comic, OB!  You didn't thank the ping pong sound, did you?  Oh, I don't think we did.  You have to thank him.  Thank you, ping pong sound.  Thank you, ping pong sound. 
[01:41:30]  John Elway?  Did we thank John Elway?  No, we didn't.  That's really John Elway.  All right.  Buddy?  Yeah, if you're just tuning in at, we'll be there at like 720 because it's going to  take us about 20 minutes to get downtown through the subway system.  But we're going to be at Privilege, corner of 23rd Street and 11th Avenue.  Doors have officially opened.  I want to thank Privilege for helping us out.  We threw this together at the last minute. 
[01:42:00]  I want to thank you guys for helping us out with the ratings.  You are a big part of the show, so you should celebrate with us.  Privilege throwing a free buffet at our listeners tonight, Anthony.  Yeah.  And the first beer is free on the O&A show and Privilege.  Tony from Putnam checking in.  Well, that's what he said.  Okay.  Very good.  Thank you. 
[01:42:30]  Thank you, Tony.  Thank you, Tony.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Congratulations.  Thank you.  First time call.  I've been listening to you for a while.  Oh, man.  Oh, cool.  Thank you.  We'll see how they report this in the paper tomorrow, if they'll give us any credit whatsoever.  They usually don't, but whatever.  One guy you didn't thank, Mike Tyson.  Oh, that's right.  What about Mike Tyson?  Why don't you thank me, you bastard?  You son of the bitches is getting too big for your bitches. 
[01:43:00]  I'm going to have to come down here and maybe give a left or right to your testicles.  You know, I was the one that, who did I talk to?  I made Bridget cry once.  Right.  Who else did I make cry?  That's Nikki from We Delivered Caggers.  Nikki, remember that?  We want to thank Nikki from We Delivered Caggers.  Yeah, I thank her.  Okay.  I would thank her with the uppercut to her vulva, and I don't mean the car, vulva, X-Q-Z-P-A, vulva. 
[01:43:30]  Next word.  Yeah.  And I would like to actually congratulate you two for a job well done.  Okay.  And if I come down here and see you, I will make sure I punch one of you in the butt so I feel a prostate.  And the other one, I'm going to punch so hard in the testicles that you're going to look like a lizard, one of those tickles.  With the eyeballs that poke each and every way, because that's going to be your nuts. 
[01:44:00]  Give me some credit.  All right.  Thank you, Mike Tyson.  Yes.  A lot of people are a part of this radio show.  EJ.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  I've got to thank all your affiliates who carry you across the nation.  Yes.  Yes, we'd like to thank all the affiliates.  Well, I'd like to do a 107.5 down in Dallas.  Yes.  That's the best station to hear you guys have.  Our Dallas affiliate.  It's still a little slow to get up there with the ratings, but we're moving. 
[01:44:30]  Also, guys, I just wanted to give a quick, you know who the stupid You're So Stupid comes from?  That comes from the great Weird Al Yankovic movie, UHF.  Yes, it does.  Very good.  Congratulations, guys.  All right.  Thank you, EJ.  Later.  Anthony, I'm a...  The fart guy I was just thanking there, Elpy.  Well, there's someone else that wants to thank us today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Or, yeah, give a thank you to our listeners, I believe.  What would the show be without... 
[01:45:00]  Celine Dion.  I want to say...  Wait first.  I want to say congratulations to Opie and Anthony, who have taken this N.E.W. ship, as it were, on its maiden voyage into talk radio. 
[01:45:30]  You had many obstacles along the way.  Remember your old boss?  Remember the promotions guy who couldn't even get a wow sticker right?  Remember the old DJs who hated you?  And your retarded boss who had everyone bamboozled?  They were much like huge icebergs in your path.  Yes.  And many times... 
[01:46:00]  Oh.  Where?  Sorry.  Many times, it seemed like you had smashed into these icebergs.  And the mighty ship, N.E.W., was going to slip beneath the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  But no, you went on.  You...  You continued on.  Opie, Anthony, I congratulate you.  Not only as radio personalities. 
[01:46:30]  Not only as winners.  But as...  Survivors.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay.  Okay.  Never let go.  Congratulations.  Hey, here I go. 
[01:47:00]  I am Sam, fear master of the pan flu.  Here it comes.  We are...  We are...  Everybody.  We are...  Anthony!  You are...  Survivors.  You are like Ross. 
[01:47:30]  Who clung on to a piece of wood.  We are...  You...  We are...  Well, Anthony, more people we've got to thank for this radio show.  Let's not forget the guy who said, what's that, a train, who started the whole phenomenon.  Yes, that ruled.  Who could forget that guy?  Anthony from Midtown, hey, what about the giant mosquito and the cancerous live wires? 
[01:48:00]  Yes, all contributing to this program.  I suggest we all have a celebratory pee from the top of the buildings today.  Hey, not on me.  Don't forget to thank you.  Here it is.  Who else?  We have to thank Yoshi for all the pork.  Yeah.  That's from Charlie from the Upper West Side. 
[01:48:30]  Who else?  Mike from Clinton, why not thank the Apache helicopter?  Ronald Reagan checking in.  Don't forget me.  Ronald Reagan, thank me.  Yes.  Congratulations to you two.  I believe.  Burns and Alan, you're the best.  Old Dirty wants to thank us off the air.  Off the air?  Well, remember he said he wants to be banned from the show for a while? 
[01:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  Nah, we got to get Old Dirty on.  Got to make an exception today.  OD, what's up?  Old Dirty.  Old Dirty.  Oh, he hung out.  He wants to be on the air.  He refuses to be on the air.  Come on.  He's taking himself out of the show.  He probably ran out of minutes on his free phone card.  All right, no Old Dirty.  Okay.  Hey, I'd like to step in and thank you.  Yeah, the Dice Man, yes.  For making my career bigger. 
[01:49:30]  No.  But you're tooting your own horn.  Yeah, we know that.  And it's not like you're selling out Madison Square Garden like I did all those years ago.  We're going to be selling out a strip club in a little while, though.  Hey, can I come?  You sure can.  Thank you.  All right.  I want to also congratulate the WWF and Jim Brewer.  Ah, yes.  Yes, of course.  Brewer.  Did you thank Roger?  Roger. 
[01:50:00]  Please.  I want to shove a fist up his you-know-what.  I want to thank him for getting fired.  Hey!  Or did he leave on his own?  I don't know what that was.  That was a truckload.  That was a distraction.  I need a satellite.  Ah, Jim, what's going on?  How are you doing, guys?  How are you?  I just wanted to thank Louie Anderson.  Oh, yes.  And I also wanted to thank American Express because Spaz never leaves home without it.  Congratulations.  Syndication when hell freezes over.  I think the beers tonight are on Spaz's credit card. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  I'll buy.  All right.  And then I'm taking everybody to St. Regis for a night with a butler.  Anthony, we also want to...  I'll iron your heavy metal shirt.  And I know he's listening, so I want to thank Steve from another radio station.  Respect our third day.  Respect my third day.  Ouch.  That must hurt.  Didn't hire us.  Ow.  Oops.

That's Steven from New Jersey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Congratulations on your rating. 
[01:52:30]  You know, I understand what it's like to be, you know, number one in your field.  And, you know, you start reaping the rewards.  You start reaping the rewards.  Do you use your tongue?  Shut up.  Of, you know, a good rating.  So, at any time, I'm sure you can just call up a girl, and she'll come down and squat over 
[01:53:00]  the glass table for you.  Yeah.  That's right, baby.  Now, I will lay under the glass table.  And you let it roll, baby.  Let it roll.  You, you started it.  I didn't start it.  Grab on me.  Grab on me, Mickey.  Oh.  Oh.  Grab me.  Grab on me.  Hey, I'm vulnerable.  Oh.  She drew first dump.

You got a lot of credit.  Yeah, the damn ratings go up.  I'll go down there, Maggie.  What the hell's the problem?  I think, I think you guys need hot wax on your show. 
[01:55:00]  Hot wax coming in on the show.  Nice.  We're going to have, uh, Mike Piazza come in and get on a blue top cab of A.  We're going to put some icing in his hand.  It's being dumped.  Oh, well.  That's funny stuff for the people on hold.  Oh, well, this is just a voice.  How can I dump out of a voice?  I'm not even saying anything.  I'm just talking.  For God's sake.  Just sounds like someone, that's all.  What the hell?  Wow.  That's bizarre now.  All right.  Hey, Hope, the big tech has got to go out to the mayor from Boston, really. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, for not having a sense of humor.  That's a good deal.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  I would like to thank Dr. Philitoff, Anthony.  Ah, for finally being able to see.  Yes.  It used to be the ratings would come out and Opie couldn't see them.  You'd have to take everyone's word for it.  Oh, they could, Opie, I swear.  Oh, Jesus, if he sees that, how bad they suck, he's going to leave.  Ah, yeah, they would. 
[01:56:00]  Thank God.  They went up when your eyes got fixed.  They would put them in Braille for me.  I want to thank Da Da Dave, our old PD.  Da Da Dave for going into the gay zone.  Right.  Yes.  Are we allowed to say who's here or no?  No.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Look at them now.  They're getting scared.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's cool, though.  Well, a lot of people stopping by the station to say hi.  Let's just put it at that, Anthony, okay?  Yeah.  Good to see you guys.  All right. 
[01:56:30]  What a pussy.  Anyway.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  Quickie, yeah.  Having lots of fun here today, and we want to, like, have a beer with you guys.  We're going to be a privilege tonight.  We picked the strip club.  Yes.  Isn't that great?  To celebrate our recent rating success.  Who gives you boobs?  Only Anthony.  Yes.  Corner of 23rd Street and 11th Avenue.  You give us ratings, we will give you breasts.  Doors open at 5.  Well, doors are open already.  Yeah.  If anyone's down there with a cell phone, I would like to know what's going on down there. 
[01:57:00]  Privilege has given our listeners a free buffet, and the first beer is free from O&A and Privilege, okay?  And we'll be there right after the show, right around 7.30-ish, okay?  Cool.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Hello.  I thought I'd inject a little intelligence to this conversation here.  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  O.P. and Anthony, more stupidity on the way.  1027-WNEW.  Ah, yes, Anthony. 
[01:57:30]  Car Cash, it's one of our newest sponsors.  Yeah.  And already our listeners are loving them.  You know why?  Do you?  They will pay you top dollar for your car.  That's it.  That's what you've got to do.  You're trying to sell your car.  You take that ad out in the paper.  You're going to wait weeks or months to sell your car.  You're going to have people calling you.  Perhaps a misprint in the paper.  It's just a big hassle.  This is the way to sell your car.  You have to stay home because you know people are stopping by.  Yeah, that's another thing.  It's just a hassle. 
[01:58:00]  Then they know where you live.  Even if they have problems with the car, after you sell it to them,  you know they're coming back to bitching you.  Car Cash makes it real easy.  Just give them a call.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  And they'll take care of all that for you and pay top dollar on the spot, Anthony.  Quick, easy, if you're selling your car or even thinking about it.  If you're thinking about selling your car, give them a call.  They'll give you a price on it right over the phone.  New cars, vans, pickups, 4x4s, even leased or financed.  If you can drive it, Car Cash is going to buy it. 
[01:58:30]  That's it.  Give them a call.  Nobody is going to give you more money for your car than Car Cash.  Very important, okay?  Top dollar.  And nobody makes selling your car easier.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  1-800-CAR-CASH.

[01:59:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I got them both.  I don't think that's weirdo.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  Smashing pumpkins tonight at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  Sold-out show.  Should be good.  We're going to privilege, though, Anthony.  Yeah, we are.  We're going to be celebrating with our listeners.  Got some great news today.  Our ratings were way, way, way, way, way, way, way up.  Thank you. 
[01:59:30]  Radio Chick did pretty well in the ratings as well.  Yeah.  Wanted to acknowledge her.  She's on her way.  She's on her way.  And the rest of the station, it's still too early to tell.  The ratings that they received today are from the past shows.  Yeah.  The morning slot there.  Open.  Oh.  It's just going to be amazing when they show up in the top 30 for the first time.  That is going to be huge news.  When the NEW morning show shows up in the top 30.  Let's just put it this way.  Our old morning show.  Manson and Kaczynski in the morning. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  They weren't even a blip on the radar screen.  No.  No.  We don't know how bad they did because they don't go that low, the ratings, in the morning.  Yeah.  They don't go that low.  Last they charted was a .5, I think.  Yeah.  And now they're below a .5.  That's what they handed Scott and Sid, our new morning show.  So I feel for those guys today.  Run with it.  Run with it.  Run with it, guys.  Make it happen.  We remember that fun.  Yeah.  There you go.  Run with it.  And Dynamite too early to tell, but they did okay. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Say hi to the guys from NMI.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  Well, they know who they are.  They're listening.  Oh, they're out there somewhere?  Of course, man.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Are they close to the station, Anthony?  Very close.  That's what I'm hearing.  Cool.  They might have been outside or something?  Could be.  Okay.  Mike from Manhattan wants to thank the Bronco that we bashed at Manny's.  That was the turning point.  That really was.  That was the turning point for this radio show. 
[02:01:00]  We finally got our asses out of this studio.  Cool.  All right.  Mike's a privilege.  Let's see what's going on down there so far.  Mike, what's up?  What's up, Ron?  Are you really a privilege?  Yeah, I'm down here now.  All right.  We're going to be there in two hours.  There's only a few people here so far, but it looks okay.  That's okay.  It looks like it's going to get packed up pretty quick, so I would advise everybody to get down here.  Yes.  It happens fast.  It happens very fast.  It's not a big, big place, so they're going to have to close the doors when we fill it up,  so I get down there. 
[02:01:30]  It's nice.  I'm sitting in a big red chair and sipping a Heineken right now.  Very good.  We'll be there in a couple hours.  Okay.  All right, Mike.  All right.  Do they have the free buffet out yet?  Yeah.  They got it out here.  They got some burners going.  They got the stay out.  All right.  It's ready to go.  All right, Mike.  Cool.  The girls are off the hook, man.  Yes, they are.  I'll tell you that much.  All right, man.  All right.  Take care.  Thank you, Mike.  Bye-bye.  We're getting reports of a wow sign on Channel 4.  Oh, no.  Are you serious?  What are they saying on the Instant Feedback? 
[02:02:00]  They're just a big wow sign on Channel 4.  Oh, no.  On the news.  At least our own Stinky and Psycho Mark are safely in the building,  so they won't be wrestled to the ground.  No, no more wrestling to the ground with those guys.  The doors open to Privilege, Anthony.  Free buffet.  First beer is on us and Privilege.  We'll be there at 730.  It's the corner of 23rd Street and 11th Avenue.  I want to have a beer with you guys because you guys obviously helped out the show, obviously.  Yeah.  Okay.  Want to talk to Old Dirty? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  All right.  O.D.  Yo.  What's up?  What's up, baby?  Congratulations, man.  Thank you.  No doubt.  Antonio.  Are you going to thank you, Old Dirty, coming from a perp like you?  You know.  You guys really making it happen, you know what I'm saying?  You going to hang with us or what?  Yeah, man.  I'm willing out there, no doubt.  Yeah.  You're going to be my man, P.R. right there, my book and Dinah.  Where are you hanging out right now?  Right now, I'm in my crib, son.  I thought you might be on 8th Avenue.  Oh, by the... 
[02:03:00]  Nah, man.  Today's Tuesday.  It's Taco Tuesday.  You don't want to be hanging out by the Port Authority bus, Sherman.  I just wanted to make the cops out there laugh.  I learned some lingo recently.  8th Avenue.  No, they call 8th Avenue, 8th Avenue.  Anthony, the bell, please.  Oh, my God.  See?  There's some cops out there laughing.  There's a dog.  Oh, there it is.  I was reading this book about some police lingo, and I'm like...  I read that, and I'm like, whoa.  All right, look.  This is a damn celebration.  Let's not wrestle the feathers, all right? 
[02:03:30]  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Well, yo, man, you guys really doing it, kid, huh?  We've been doing it for a while.  You know what I'm saying?  This was the highest book yet.  Oh, what?  It was like that?  Double digits?  Double digits?  It was through the roof.  Nah, in the real?  Yeah.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Very happy.  All the newspapers called us.  We'll see what they print tomorrow.  They'll downplay it somehow.  That's all right.  They'll put some kind of negative spin on it.  Yeah.  You have to be.  Yeah, I know.  That's the New York Press.  That's all right.

[02:12:00]  Wow.  That's a very good question and I can answer that.  Okay.  We started, um, two years ago.  Uh, not even two years ago.  Year and nine months ago.  Um, we were in 23rd place overall.  Yeah.  Um, it was grim.  Um, today, overall, that, that includes the women.  Women, children, and old people.  Everybody.  We are now up to sixth place, 12 plus.  But in the key demos for this, uh, radio show and this radio station, we are number one in every male demo that matters. 
[02:12:30]  That's terrific.  And, and, and the, and the male, the male numbers, uh, before we got here, they were all in like the, uh, I don't know, like the teens at least, if not further down.

Yeah, I want to thank, uh, Joey Paisano for, uh, feeding all the hanger-ons.  And I think we have the, uh, the Lamb Chop interview, Anthony.  This goes way back.  Yes. 
[02:14:30]  This was like the first week we were on the air.  What's-her-name died?  Sherry Lewis.  Sherry Lewis.  She did, uh, Lamb Chop.  Yeah.  She did Lamb Chop, and, uh, we had the exclusive interview with Lamb Chop right after she died.  A little bitter.  A little, he was very, he was a very happy puppet.  Yeah.  As we go to break, check this out.  Hello, Lamb Chop.  I'm free.  I'm free at last.  Free at last.  Thank God Almighty.  I'm free at last.  Wait a minute.  What are you talking about?  I thought you liked Sherry Lewis.  Hang down.  The witch is dead.  What do you mean by that?  Thank God. 
[02:15:00]  Why do you sound so bitter?  She gave you your, your break in showbiz.  You'd be better, too, if you had a hand up your ass for 20 years.  She wouldn't even take me off when she went to the bathroom, if you catch my drift.  Ah, come on.  Oh, and then she thought it was cute calling me fucking Lamb Chop.  That's like calling a cow meatloaf, sadistic bitch.  I was the whole act, and she knew it.  We hated each other.  She sucked.  Oh, she's real creative. 
[02:15:30]  I haven't listened to that shit for 20 years.  Creative?  I'm a fucking sock.  Good thing she didn't have a condom in her hand when she thought me up.  Things would look a little different.  Hey, her fucking lips moved when she talked.  What kind of crap is that?  It's about to be a ventriloquist, and your mouth is moving like Monica Lewinsky's.  I'm a 45-cent sock from Woolworths that she made a fucking fortune off of, and I didn't  get dicked. 
[02:16:00]  Lamb Chop, what's in your future?  Oh, I'm going to be in a couple of new films.  Yeah?  That Lamb Chop sucks a big dick, and shove your fist in my ass, and my career's flying, that  fucking bitch.  All right, Lamb Chop, I better let you go more and some more.  All right, bye-bye, kids.  Bye.  All right, it's Lamb Chop, everyone.  I can't even believe these morons. 
[02:16:30]  He's a disgusting little man.  And Anthony, what a douchebag.  Brainwreck radio.  Stand over.  This is sicker than faces of death.  1827 WNEW.

[02:18:30]  All right.  We're having a good time today.  Have you checked out wrestling last night?  Oh, yes, I did.  Yesterday night, Rob?  Yes.  I wasn't even going to get into the wrestling part.  Have you seen the Sammy Sosa computer game commercial yet?  Yeah.  It's so real.  It's so real.  And like they dubbed in something where he says real.  I don't know what he was saying, but it looks like he was saying, it's so ah. 
[02:19:00]  It's so, it's so real.  There's a kid, Sammy, you're at the wrong game.  You're supposed to be at my house.  You know, the game is so real that Sammy doesn't know if he's supposed to be in the computer game  or in the, on the field really playing.  That's like the wacky commercial concept.  So, uh, Sammy's cell phone rings when he's at the plate and it's the kid going, no, Sammy,  you're supposed to be at my house.  And Sammy's like, what?  What? 
[02:19:30]  What?  And he looks at the camera, it's so surreal.  They couldn't even get him to say three words.  It's so real.  And I swear they dubbed it in.  You can see his mouth unreal.  He's going, it's so raw.  Right.  Raw.  I'm going to have to check that out.  They're running that commercial all the time.  It's so funny.  Hey, speaking of wrestling, Shane McMahon will be on the show Friday.  Shane McMahon.  They got a huge pay-per-view coming up Sunday.  Huge.  Where's Stephanie? 
[02:20:00]  Oh, God.  Got to get her in here.  That'd be funny.  That would be ugly.  In the short cans.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Yeah.  Coming back.  At the pay-per-view.  Going to be in the Rocks corner.  Yeah.  Against, uh, Triple H, who is going to have, um, who's going to be in his corner?  Stephanie.  I guess Stephanie and, uh, Shane.  Shane.  And, uh, Vince, right?  Oh, Vince, right.  That's right.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Boy, I think something's going to go awry.  I, I see some kind of turn happen.  I think someone's going to get hit in the head with a chair come Sunday. 
[02:20:30]  Do you think it's time for Stephanie to turn on, uh, Triple H?  Hmm.  No, it's getting close.  No, not yet?  It's getting close.  They're going to, they're going to play it out for another, knowing WWF six more months,  but.  Someone's going to make a turn.  Yeah.  You know it.  Because the whole Stone Cold thing, Stone Cold is not going to be friends with the Rock.  Right.  You know that.  That's going to come to an ugly ending.  You think someone turns during this pay-per-view?  You think Austin's going to turn, man?  Yeah.  I don't think Austin can turn. 
[02:21:00]  He can't do anything.  He's just going to be, like, just hanging out.  Yeah, he's got to reestablish himself first.  No, he can't even wrestle yet.  Oh, he can't?  No, they're, they're, they're bringing him back way too early.  So, I mean.  I got a stiff neck.  Yeah, he does.  You see him?  He, like, can barely move.  Looks like I got a big stick up my ass.  So his participation's going to be minimal at best, Anthony.  He might be able to, you know, you know, hit someone with a chair.  That's about it.  Pretty small can of whoop-ass.  He's the gimp.  Uh, the animal activist, activist checking in, by the way, from Jersey. 
[02:21:30]  You bastards didn't thank those poor mice who, uh, poor mice who were eaten by that guy for the trip to Hawaii.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Oh, wow.  Heh heh.  Maybe you should read that one.  Yeah, true.  Okay, terrific.  Pending litigation.  Yeah, I know.  Pending litigation.  We're getting a lot of reports from the, um, the club, Privilege. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  We're going to be celebrating down there at, uh, 730 tonight.  Doors are already open.  There's a free buffet.  And the first beer is on us and Privilege, Anthony.  I see them eating everything before we get there.  It's a 21-plus club.  Of course.  Well, I know.  It's a small place.  We're going to be seeing some naked boobies.  It's a small place.  It's going to fill up fast.  So get down there, uh, soon, okay?  Yeah.  I, I heard, I heard there's only like 30 or 40 people there right now. 
[02:22:30]  That's it.  Really?  So you still have time to get down there, but I would do it soon, okay?  People waiting until, uh, we're going to get down there.  Is that what they're doing?  I believe so, yeah.  Is Rudy Giuliani going to stop down?  Celebrate with us?  Ha ha ha.  I love the boobie bars.  Yeah.  And Privilege is at the corner of 23rd Street and 11th Avenue.  Yeah.  Uh, someone on the Instant Feedback wants us to thank Brian Regan, Anthony.  Brian Regan.  I just happened to bring in the Brian Regan CD today.  This guy's hysterical.  We could play a track real fast here. 
[02:23:00]  I love him.  Let me find something good.  Yeah, Brian Regan's one of our faves.  He works very clean and gets the job done.  I think I found something quick and, and, and painless, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Brian Regan, check this out.  O.P.L. Anthony.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  102.7 WNEW.  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:24:00]  This is a great version by Overkill, by the way. 
[02:24:30]  With Anthony accompanying on Sam Spears' pan flute.  And should we do, like, an instrumental two for today?  Yeah.  Two for Tuesday on WNEW. 
[02:25:00]  Wait a minute.  I heard it was exclusively on some other stage in Opie.  Wait, how is that better than this?  Way to start all the bands, Anthony. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, I feel like Fatboy Slim today. 
[02:26:00]  Anyway, it's D-O-N-H-O.  Can you tell the champagne has taken hold of us?  Uh-oh.  A little champagne.  How's that mixing with your Valium?  Good.  It evens me right the hell out.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  Peace, sir.  I want some more.  Peace, sir.  Phone line 212-757-1027. 
[02:26:30]  We're getting out of here in, like, 45 minutes.  We're going down to privilege to celebrate with our listeners once again.  Join us.  We have the best excuses for celebrating with our listeners.  Yeah.  This one's pretty good, you know.  We had a good ratings book.  We're feeling good.  Uh-huh.  Feeling good about the show, so we might as well milk it for a day.  Yeah.  When they turn it around and stick it in our ass.  Right.  For something we do.  Right.  So, uh, we went to the boss and said, hey, we want to take our listeners, uh, as many 
[02:27:00]  as will fit in a place, and, and go out with them.  Have a beer.  And what a better place than Privilege.  Privilege.  A strip club.  23rd Street and 11th Avenue.  Doors are already open.  There's a bunch of people down there.  Uh, it's not filled up yet, though.  That's good news.  Yeah.  So, if you're in an area, stop by.  We'll be there in about an hour.  Uh, they have a free buffet going on, and we worked this out with the, with the club.  No cover charge.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, the first beer is on us and Privilege, Anthony. 
[02:27:30]  Thank you.  It's a small place, and you've got to be 21 or older, so, uh, I would get down there  soon, okay?  Yeah.  Thank you for the, uh, great ratings, really.  Man.  Starting out here with, uh, the, the, the bottom rung of the ladder.  And climbing up with the help of our listeners, Opie.  Jimmy.  It's good.  Give Jimmy some, uh, champagne.  Yes.  Jimmy was here at the beginning.  Jimmy doesn't even get to hear the show, because he's too busy putting all the production 
[02:28:00]  together for our show.  Jimmy, you remember the early days, don't you?  Remember the grimness of a couple of years ago?  With the help of therapy, I blocked him out.  Matter of fact.  Thanks for bringing up those, uh, wounds again, Anthony.  Our old boss.  Matter of fact, he just walked in with a brand new production piece, Anthony.  All right.  Gotta play it.  This is what Jimmy does for the show.  Nasty.  Ladies and gentlemen, the following statement does not necessarily reflect the opinion of  anyone in his right mind. 
[02:28:30]  Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1027 WNAW.  Yeah.  Okay.  Terrific.  You'll hear that a thousand times.  My, how far we've come.  Uh, Anthony, also, um, Steve checking in from foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com. 
[02:29:00]  And, um, we've been having, like, a caption contest with that famous picture from the Elian  Gonzalez, uh, C's.  With the, uh, guy busting in with the, uh, the gun and holding it, uh, against the kid  in the Donato, I guess his name is.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, people have been coming up with some really good captions.  Yeah, well, um.  And changing the picture around.  It's not even a caption thing anymore.  People have taken the picture, scanned it into their computer, or just pulled it off  a website, and, uh, doctored it.  To the point where they're putting our faces on it, and you gotta, you gotta see the best 
[02:29:30]  one that has, that came in.  It came in today.  It's in, uh, Files 5, if you're familiar with the foundrymusic.com website.  Um, I was screwing around right after my, my laser eye surgery.  I came in with these really wacky glasses.  Yeah.  I didn't have to wear these glasses, but I was pulling around.  I know.  I look like, uh, where's Waldo, because I have the hat on top and stuff.  I'm the gunman.  I'm the gunman with these wacky glasses on.  Uh, I'm pointing the gun at Anthony, who is holding himself. 
[02:30:00]  When I was a child, they got the picture of me wearing the fur coat when I was about  11 or 12.  Mm-hmm.  So, uh, I, I'm holding myself.  Yes.  And in the closet is Spaz peeking out.  Peeking out around the door.  Uh, there's a wow sticker on the closet door.  There's a couple signs in the background.  We love O&A signs.  One says, cranky ass.  The other one says, Elyon 316.  And, you know, there's, uh, if you look closely at the famous picture, there's another gunman  entering the room.  Yeah.  Well, uh, that gunman is now Ziggy from, uh, the homeless shopping spree to Short Hills 
[02:30:30]  Mall.  Ziggy just is all in the face peeking around the corner.  It is hilarious.  There's a bunch of them on here.  Uh, there's also one where a guy made a band out of the picture where the gunman is now  the lead guitarist and Elyon is, uh, screaming into a microphone.  That's funny, Donato's holding the mic for Elyon to sing into, and it looks like he's  screaming, and the gunman has a, uh, Fender Strat in his hand.  He's jamming.  That's pretty good.  We're going to get a bunch more, uh, because we're getting tons of these. 
[02:31:00]  Uh, the next one is, uh, well, we've got to thank Len.  Len, who eliminated Elyon altogether, but added Dr. Zachary Smith, oh dear, with young  William.  Yeah, it's, it's one of those clips from Lost in Space where Dr. Smith is scared and he's  grabbing Will.  And that's who the gunman's pointing the, uh, that's who the agent's pointing his gun  at.  Oh dear, you'll never get the boy.  And, um, then the famous one, the famous picture, and all it says is drop the chalupa. 
[02:31:30]  Very good.  We'll have more up in the coming days.  My brother's on the line, I believe.  Uh-oh, here it is.  Uh-oh, here it is.  Hello, hello, hello.  Oh.  It's Elmo, what's up?  Hey, um, I'm driving with this girl, she lives across the street, she's very hot.  Yeah.  And I'm trying to get her to wow me, but she won't do it.  So I'm hoping you can talk to her, maybe talk her through it.  Talk her in.  Okay.  Keep your nose up, keep your wings level, bring her in. 
[02:32:00]  You should see the runway lights.  Hello?  Uh, Jennifer, first of all, how old are you?  Because my brother likes to hang out with young girls.  20.  Okay, very good.  Tomorrow, my birthday's tomorrow.  Wow, you're old.  I know, very.  As far as my brother goes.  Yeah, I know.  Are you going to wow my brother, Darren?  No.  Why?  Because there's no way, I'm sorry.  Who are you?  I'm his neighbor.  So why won't you wow him?  Why are you in the car with him?  I'm in the car, we went to 7-Eleven to get some food.  Really? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Well, he obviously wants to see your ta-tas.  I know he wants to see my ta-tas.  My brother is the designer of the brand new wow sticker.  Oh, yeah, the designer of the new wow sticker, Darren?  Yes.  Oh, look at that.  Why don't you give him a hug?  Would you let me try to ask you a question?  If I put a wow sticker on my car, can I see some, you know, from the guys?  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yeah.  Yes.  See, that's kind of, that's not fair.  How would you like to move my lawn?  Huh?  Trust me, if you show my brother your ta-tas, I think he'll whip it out. 
[02:33:00]  See what he says?  Huh?  If you show your brother your ta-tas, I'm sure he'll whip it out.  Gee, thank you.  He does have the, well, I can't say my last name.  He has the family blessing.  Does he really?  Do you have the family blessing?  Yes, he does.  Hey, just ask him to say this.  What?  Ask him to say this.  Okay.  Hey, what, hey, what are we going to do about this?  Hey, what are we going to do about this?  He wants me to say that. 
[02:33:30]  Hey, what are we going to do about this?  Look at my brother using my radio show to get some towel.  He does.  He wants, he really wants it.  You want to play What's in Your Pants?  No, he wants me to play What's in My Pants.  You sure?  Yeah, you want to do that?  No, I'm scared.  Whose phone is it?  No, how do you play this?  Well, you stick the phone down your pants and you rub it a little bit.  Oh, my God, you've got to be kidding me.  No.  You obviously don't listen to this radio show.  I usually don't. 
[02:34:00]  He told me that you're honest, so I just watched it in my car radio.  My brother is, like, using me to try to get laid.  He is.  Don't lie now.  Oh, my God.  All right, look, she's cursing now.  Look, look, look.  Sorry, my brother.  You best just keep your mouth shut and take your clothes off.  Yeah.  Are you going to show my brother your boobs or what?  He wants me to show you my boobs.  What's in your pants?  No, I don't want to play What's in My Pants, Darren.  I'm sorry.  Jennifer, you're wasting valuable radio time. 
[02:34:30]  Are you going to show some...  I'm wasting that valuable radio time.  You're out of New York.  Pull your pants down.  You are the idiot that calls him.  Oh, they're arguing already.  God damn it.  We're not together.  Gee, they went right to marriage.  I know.  Great.  If we wanted to hear this, we'd all go home.  Oh, God.  Can we see your stuff?  Get your brother.  This is really boring.  Can we see your stuff?  All right, let me get...  Let me talk to my brother.  I'm here. 
[02:35:00]  Dude.  Yeah.  Can you hear me?  No.  She better be hot.  I think she's hot.  Yeah?  You need...  You got roofies?  Because it sounds like that's what you're going to need, really.  Roofies.  Into a drink.  Darren, get the...  I throw a big gulp.  Get the shovel out of the trunk.  Duck tape.  Duck tape.  You can't rip that duck tape.  No matter how much they squirm.  And it usually doesn't come loose, even when drenched in blood.  All right, listen.  Well, I want to thank... 
[02:35:30]  That's probably about the only way.  It'll work here.  Even though this phone call sucked, I want to thank my brother.  He is the designer of the new Wow sticker that will be all pretty good.  All over the tri-state area in the coming weeks.  Would you like to thank anybody?  Um, well, you know, my agent and, you know, God.  Ugh.  Props to Jen here.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Anyone else?  Uh...  Ugh.  And he should get together with your brother. 
[02:36:00]  I guess...  Oh, I don't know.  Could have the Darren and Joe show.  Darren and Joe show on the queue.  We should do that for, like, April Fool's or something.  We just have our brothers do the show one day.  We'll have Darren do my part and Joe do your part.  It'd be pretty funny.  Wow.  We should do that.  Maybe I'll have to get some naked chicks.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Dude, why are you wasting your time?  She ain't going to show you nothing.  Because I'm trying, you know?  Yeah.  You're the last hope.  You've got to get a radio...  You're like Obi-Wan Kenobi, man.  I forgot how it used to be. 
[02:36:30]  You've got to get a radio show, man.  You bastard.  All right, man.  All right, well, see you later.  All right.  Thanks for trying.  Good job on the sticker.  Maybe I'll get some later.  Bye.  Oh.  How many times have you heard that?  That's like...  He's going to waste...  Maybe I'll get some later.  No, my brother's going to waste...  He's going to waste the next four hours trying.  Ah!  Ah!  Maybe I'll get some later.  Ah!  Ah!  Maybe I'm a Chinese jet fighter.  All right, Anthony. 
[02:37:00]  If you're at Privilege, please give us a call.  We want to know what's going on down there.  Yes.  We are leaving for Privilege, the strip club on 23rd Street and 11th Avenue within the hour.  We're going to be celebrating our fine ratings.  Okay, terrific.  Yes.  That we got today, Anthony.  The doors are already open.  There's a bunch of our listeners enjoying the festivities.  There's a free buffet.  And the first beer is on us.  And Privilege.  And there is no cover charge at the door.  You give us ratings.  We give you breasts. 
[02:37:30]  More boobs.  How about that?  So if you have Privilege, please give us a call, okay?  No private party here.  No.  We don't do that.  And let's not forget, it's 21 and over.  Throw the doors open.  All right.  Well, that was a bummer.  We should have played one round of, you know, What's in My Pants.  It's so real.  It's so real. 
[02:38:00]  I want to touch it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's so real.  Whoa.  Champagne down.  Boss.  Boss alert.  Anyway, looks like that seat.  Look at that.  Everybody.  It looked like, I swear to God, it looked like Animal House when Dean Warmer came in to Delta  House.  Clang, clang, clang.  You're at the toll booth.  Pierce down.  What are the toll collectors going to do?  I never understood that, you know? 
[02:38:30]  Hey, how you doing, boss?  Are you coming to Privilege?  I'll buy a lap gas on my credit card.  Yeah, is Spaz going to be at the cash machine?  Karen, what's going on?  You going to have the ATMs are at the coffee bars?  Hold on, Karen.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'll pay for all luck answers for all our listeners.  Spaz has to go.  He says he won't go.  Why?  Get Spaz in here.  Uh-oh. 
[02:39:00]  Karen, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to call and congratulate you on your awesome ratings.  Thank you.  We'll be back to doing radio tomorrow.  We apologize for this message.  Yeah, we're just having a show today.  But we're a party.  We're very happy today.  I also wanted to thank the Spaz cab.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Okay, here we go.  All right.  Thank you, Karen.  No problem.  Oh, let's get ready to rumble.  All right, Spaz, why are you not hanging with the number one afternoon drive show in New York City of Privilege with our listeners? 
[02:39:30]  This is unexpected.  I'm in the process of moving.  It's a bad time.  You are not going to move at 7 o'clock at night.  No, but I got stuff I got to do.  Spaz, go work for, like, the show that's in 10th place.  We're not going to stay there long.  I think the listeners are expecting to see the people that are involved in this program.  I got to be home by 8.30.  Oh!  Uh-oh.  Spaz.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Spaz, you're just assuming we're going to be number one forever?  This is a very special day.  I know, but this all caught me by surprise. 
[02:40:00]  Spaz.  Spaz.  Spaz, wait a minute.  Now, no one's going to say it, but everyone's assuming there's a reason why you're not going.  That's the reason.  It's not it.  So, shit.  I don't care how tough you are.  That's not the reason.  Uh-oh.  Fight Club.  Old Dirty is in the studio.  Spaz.  He's razzing Spaz.  You pussy whipped.  I have not pussy whipped.  What happened, Spaz?  My girlfriend, Sandy's even going.  Spaz.  I don't understand that.  She hates strip clubs, and she's going.  Spaz.  Wait. 
[02:40:30]  Spaz.  Unacceptable.  Unacceptable.  Unacceptable.  Unacceptable.  This is a required extracurricular activity.  Let me tell you something.  You want to get closer to everybody that's involved with this show, and you're blowing us off  when it's a very special day for us?  Unacceptable.  I want to get closer.  I'll make a phone call.  Make a phone call.  Come back and report to us.  Change your plans.  Bring your lovely girlfriend.  Tell her to get on the train.  Tell her to join us.  All right? 
[02:41:00]  Make that call.  Hey, Mark.  Is Ken going?  Uh-oh.  He just flipped Mark the bird, man.  If someone doesn't go out there and listen in on this call, I swear I'll shoot somebody.  I want a full transcript of this phone call.  No, let's get him to call his girlfriend live on the air.  Live on the air.  Get him in here.  Live on the air.  Live on the air.  Live on the air.  Oh, my God.  Dude, you know that's what it is.  Come on.  ABC guy, what's up?  How's it going?  Hey. 
[02:41:30]  What are you trying to say?  Okay, terrific.  My, uh, we're going to say whatever to get on the air, but, uh, my buddy has a huge lower  lip like Patrick Ewing, and, uh, whatever.  All right, listen, we're going to get Spaz's girlfriend on the line, and we'll smooth this  over.  And Spaz has to join us.  It's a privilege.  It's required.  Without a doubt.  This is one of those things that you have to go to. 
[02:42:00]  It's part of the show.  All right, hold on.  We've got to take a break first.  No, look how late we are.  But hang up the phone.  I want to talk to Mo.  He was at Privilege.  I want to see what kind of crowd you've got.  Hey, wise guy.  Hey, Mo, what's up?  Hey, Mo.  First time caller.  Hey, thanks, Mo.  Congratulations on the rating.  Your movie sucked last night, by the way.  What?  The movie sucked last night, by the way.  Hey, Mo.  Hey, I'm warning you.  I was just down there, man, and my friend forgot his wallet.  We've got to go back.  We're going to get it.  Well, you guys are supposed to stay until we get there. 
[02:42:30]  We're going back there.  We're going back there now.  Hey, your furniture's in competent hands.  We're all incompetent.  Hey, Mo.  All right, Mo.  Yeah, take care, guys.  All right, bye.  You suck.  Robert's outside the club.  They won't let him in.  Robert.  Yeah, guys.  What's going on?  I'm on 10th Avenue and 23rd Street.  I just tried to go in, and there's a big black down set with a funny little hat.  Won't let me in.  Why?  What did you do to him?  Nothing.  Are you 21? 
[02:43:00]  You have ID?  I'm 20.  What did he do?  Is that why you won't let him in?  Dude, you're going to get us screwed.  It's 21 and over.  Oh, I didn't know.  That's why.  I didn't know that.  And that guy's a friend of the show.  Oh, see, I didn't know that.  I apologize.  It's a naked breast, which has been deemed harmful to the youth of America, so you have  to be 21 to see a boobie.  Yes.  All right, guys.  I'm sorry to bother you.  All right, Robert.  All right.  All right, bye.  All right, bye.  Yes, 21 and over, please.  Like Opie said, we will do an appearance at a Chuck E. Cheese sometime in the near future. 
[02:43:30]  We'll have a special where we all get in the ball pit.  Yes.  With the colored balls and baby drool.  Anyone else at Privilege, give us a call, but we're going to be there at 730, 23rd Street  and 11th Avenue.  It's not too late to get your ass in the door.  That doesn't end up on a promo.  Opie and Anthony.  Colored balls and baby drool.  N-E-W.  They got a free buffet.  First beer is on us and Privilege, 21 and over.  All right? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Get your ass down there.  It's going to fill up by the time we get there.  Okay.  We'll be back and we'll get Spaz and his girlfriend on the phone next.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  Me suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW.  I might actually have to move the NEW preset in my truck up a notch.  Up a notch?  Just one notch.  It is still the last preset on my radio.  Ah.  I'm very critical. 
[02:44:30]  I'm on it all the time.  Now.  But remember the debauchery that was our first few months here with management and everyone else?  I refused to put it number one on my radio dial.  It was the sixth button.  And it is still the sixth button.  Remember?  We leave you with the sounds of NEW years past. 
[02:45:00]  All right, Ant.  We're almost out of here.  We're going to Privilege.  We'll be there by 730.  I'm hearing there's plenty of room still at this point.  Yep.  Let her rip.  Privilege, corner of 23rd Street and 11th Avenue.  21 and over, please.  Free admission.  Free buffet.  First beer on O&A.  And Privilege, okay?  Little thank you for the wonderful ratings you've given us.  Now, Spaz just dropped a bombshell and said he's not going to be hanging with us tonight. 
[02:45:30]  I'm not going.  I have to move.  If you were listening to the soap opera, that is Spaz.  Last week, he wants to get close to everyone.  I want to get closer to the bosses.  That's part of this show.  I was talking with Jeremy.  I guess he just assumes that we're going to just be number one for the next ten years.  This is a very special day, Spaz.  Did you see Jeremy come in just earlier and say goodbye because he was going back to Washington?  And everybody's like, all right, Jeremy, take it easy, take it easy.  And Spaz is trying to get his personal goodbye in there. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  He's like in the corner of the studio.  He's like, Jeremy, goodbye, Jim.  And Jeremy just walked out of the studio.  It was so sad.  I heard he did say hi to Ken, the real big boss.  The biggest boss at the station.  What happened there?  Then he put his head down and said hello and ran right into his office.  Of course he did.  He thinks you're a lunatic.  Well, Spaz, we have a feeling that you're pussy whipped and we got your girlfriend on the line.  I'm not pussy whipped.  The lovely Erica is on the phone. 
[02:46:30]  Yes.  Erica?  Erica?  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  My battery's dying, so you guys have to make this really quick.  All right, Spaz, talk to Erica.  Erica?  Yeah.  Hi.  The guys are going to Privilege tonight to celebrate being number one?  Yeah, I told you you could already go when I called you before.  I asked you if you were going and you said no.  So you're blaming it on your girl and it's a...  You're right.  You're blaming it on me.  Loser.  Loser.  Loser.  Loser.  Loser.  Now you're not allowed to go.  What a loser. 
[02:47:00]  He says this all the time.  He says this all the time.  What's your problems, Spaz?  I'm not going unless I'm going with you.  Kevin.  Kevin.  Oh, my God.  Kevin.  Yes?  I'm on my way there already, so...  Oh, so Erica's going.  Now that would have been funny.  You don't have to go.  Erica, what are the odds we'll get you on stage to do a little pole dance?  What?  There are no odds at all.  My girlfriend's going to do it.  She's not going on stage. 
[02:47:30]  Erica?  Yeah.  I'm going.  She's not a showpiece for everybody.  Oh, I'm going to go at night.  Yes, just for me.  Just for you.  Very cute.  Erica, so you're going to join us at Privilege.  Yes, I am.  Very good.  Were you going to tell Spaz this?  Because he was running home.  He is such...  I called him before when I heard about it, and I asked him if he was going, so I knew what  I should do for the rest of the night.  And he said, no, I'm coming home.  I said, are you sure you don't want to go? 
[02:48:00]  He was like, I'm positive.  Don't even go there.  So I told him he could go.  Stop it!  Do not even go there.  So you told him he could go, and he decided that he doesn't want to hang out with us, I guess.  I guess so.  Stop it!  Because I asked him if he wanted to go.  He said no.  Huh.  Spaz, what's the problem, man?  Why wouldn't he want to go?  Don't worry.  The strippers take credit cards.  Why wouldn't he want to go?  I'm tired.  I'm broke.  I have things to do. 
[02:48:30]  And you...  I guess I'm going now.  Oh, gee, thanks.  Gee, thanks for throwing us a bone.  No, you go home, and we'll hang with Erica.  Don't worry.  We won't touch her.  We'll just have fun.  Erica, you want to hang out with us, right?  Yeah.  I'm on my way there.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  But I have to, like, figure out, like, where Kevin's going to be, because all I know how  to get to is the studio, so...  Uh, how far are you from the studio? 
[02:49:00]  About 25 minutes.  All right.  That's not bad.  You want to just meet her outside, Spaz?  Yes.  Let's make your plans live on the air.  This is great.  Is that okay?  Yeah.  Okay.  And then you can drive down there together?  That's right, right.  I'm allowed to go, Kevin.  You sure?  Yes, you can.  I was only going to go...  I know that's the deal.  You want to just keep your girlfriend away from our listeners.  Is that it?  I knew it.  I hit it right on the head. 
[02:49:30]  Once again.  I look like crap anyway, so it really doesn't matter.  No one has been through too much.  Already.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  What are you going to do?  Keep her chained at home?  She's been through...  I put her through too much.  She wants to hang out with us.  She's part of the show, like you are.  I just don't want to put her through any more hell.  Hell, it's boring.  Just don't write it down on your calendar, and everything will be okay.  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  All right.  Erica, we'll see you at the station in a little while. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  Make sure Spaz doesn't talk you out of going down there.  Oh, I don't care.  Stay away from old D.  He can take the train home.  I'll still go.  What?  Cool.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  All right, Erica.  Bye.  Stay away from her.  Oh, my God.  Spaz, will you...  Spaz is telling old Dirty to stay away from her.  You are so, like, defensive.  You're going to lose her just because of that.  Mellow out.  Because I know she's...  It's just kidding.  Because I know she's beautiful and everything, so I'm...  Why, girl? 
[02:50:30]  Creamy like the inside of a tweaking.  I'm going to have me swap me tonight.  Look, you're going to be ripped.  Oh, you're going to be messy.  Spaz, you get too possessive.  She's going to run for the hills, man.  All right.  I'll calm down.  Relax, Kevin.  Relax.  Yo, relax.  Okay.  White girl. 
[02:51:00]  What's on the menu tonight?  We're having white girls.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wow.  Spaz chasing after old Dirty.  Mmm.  Old Dirty, don't touch the women down the privilege.  No, I've changed in a week.  I really have.  I went up to the Fortress of Solitude.  The Fortress of Solitude, yeah.  And I, you know, I went down the list of everything that I was doing wrong.  Uh-huh.  And I changed, and I'm a new man.  You have a tone. 
[02:51:30]  That's right.  All right.  I have a tone for my sins, but I'm probably sitting with Kevin's girlfriend.  Mmm.  The Fortress of Solitude.  Yes.  That's called Rikers, right?  No.  I was thinking about the regular name for that.  All right.  Keith's mom, what's up?  Hey, all in a.  How are you, Keith's mom?  Hey, Keith's mom.  I'm so happy that you finally took my call.  Yes.  I'm having a big problem.  Why?  Well, you know, my 12-year-old son that was on the radio with you in the one bit of the week. 
[02:52:00]  Keith rules.  I'm so happy about that.  Keith, yeah.  About me, because they recognize my voice.  Keith watched you and your lovely husband have sex.  Well, I didn't know about that.  I understand that.  Yeah, I didn't know about that.  But I have an older son, a 16-year-old son, that, like, we're really close, and his friends will love me, and they think I'm, like, the cool mom.  Yeah.  But whenever I try, like, you know, like, calling up on the radio, I mean, we have tapes of all the songs. 
[02:52:30]  We loved all the inappropriate songs and stuff.  Yeah.  Does this story have any point at any time in this story?  It does.  Could you please reach it?  All right.  I'm trying.  I'm glad you're not giving me the train.  It's because, like, you try to be, like, you never, when you're young, all right, come on.  When you're young, you never think that you're going to be, like, old and sorry.  You're going to have to hold on for two seconds.  Hold on, hold on.  This is the funniest thing going on in here.  You cannot even imagine what just happened. 
[02:53:00]  I caught the view of it.  Spaz has boxing gloves on.  Get him, Rick.  Spaz put boxing gloves on.  And old Dirty has boxing gloves on.  For some reason, Rick got into the mix.  Spaz punched Rick right in the forehead.  Punched him right in the forehead.  And gloves on.  All right.  So there's a little fight.  So now there's a fight club going on, but they're really throwing.  Like, Rick is ready to throw.  Rick is very pissed off.  Put the gloves on, Rick.  Put the gloves on.  Put the gloves on.  Put the gloves on.  Give him a little love tap. 
[02:53:30]  God, a Spanish guy against a white guy.  Guess who's going to bleed.  I'm going to get my head off.  Oh, man.  All right.  Listen.  No blood.  Not over there.  Shit.  Shit.  This is some...  I want to fight you.  No, you want to fight me.  Too late.  You pushed Rick in the face.  I don't like it.  All right.  Listen.  Just nice.  Like a little pillow fight.  Yes, of course.  All right.  Don't go crazy.  They're squaring off.  Spaz and Rick. 
[02:54:00]  Rick got punched square in the face by Spaz.  And he punched him in the face.  He didn't see it coming.  Rick was trying to let him get a few warm-ups in.  Warm-ups.  Like he was going to...  He put his hands up and Spaz just punched him in the face.  Oh, my God.  Spaz taking up defensive position.  Oh, my God.  Spaz is going to look like Chuck Webner in a minute here.  Spaz.  Not in the nose.  Not in the nose.  What are you nuts?  Don't hurt him, man.  Look at it.  It's just a standoff.  No one's throwing.  This doesn't look good.  They're just standing at each other. 
[02:54:30]  No, this doesn't look good.  Oh, Spaz doing some fancy footwork.  Spaz doing the rope-a-dope, Anthony.  Get a body blow.  Spaz is doing the rope-a-dope.  Strike those ribs, Rick.  No, no, no.  It's going to get open.  I know it's going to get open.  They're going at it.  Wait a minute.  No one's...  Oh, man.  Oh, Rick.  Spaz took a shot at Rick.  Just a glancing blow off the face.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Stop it.  It came too real. 
[02:55:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Calm down.  Calm down.  It's so real.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Rick just popped him in the head.  Spaz is up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Dude, they're brawling.  All right.  Hold on.  Spaz knocked the clock on the wall.  Spaz is jumping up, trying to hit him in the head.  Spaz is...  Spaz rabbit punched the clock.  The clock fell off the wall and knocked Rick on the top of the head.  The clock is broken.  All right. 
[02:55:30]  That's the end of the round.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  At one point, Spaz hit the ground.  Rick leaned over, because Spaz is sitting on the ground ready to get up, and punched him  right in the face.  And then Spaz just went animal, started jumping around like a lunatic, and punched the clock  off the wall.  I cleaned his clock.  No, Spaz, you broke the clock in the studio.  Yeah, the clock went falling right on top of Rick's head. 
[02:56:00]  That was great.  Yeah.  Is there any wonder why this show's number one?  It has a new drive.  All right, listen.  Wow.  Wow.  I need the clock so we know what time it is.  You guys are insane.  You guys are crazy.  Like, just punching each other in the face.  Gloves up.  Gloves don't matter.  I saw you lean over and punch that right in the friggin' head. 
[02:56:30]  Right in the forehead.  Yeah, you guys shake.  Ken Stevens, I'd like to punch you at some point.  We're all supposed to be on the same team today.  We're all happy.  Okay, good.  Wow.  That was great.  God, now we got boxing gloves for Fight Club?  That's a little crazy.  That is a little nuts.  You need headgear.  Yeah, you need the headgear.  You need headgear and stuff.  You got that on video?  Yeah, I got it right here.  You missed the video, didn't you?  I got it all. 
[02:57:00]  No, you got it.  Oh, awesome.  Okay.  Jesus.  You got the clock falling off the wall and hitting Rick on the head?  Did you get the shot?  All right, good.  I got the sucker punch.  All right, good.  You totally sucker punch, Spaz.  Yeah, that was a good sucker punch.  Spaz fell down.  He's sitting on his ass.  He goes to get up, so he puts his hand down on the floor to boost himself up.  Rick leans over and punches him in the face.  I didn't get much behind him because big Kevin's right between us.  So I had to, like, go over Kevin and just...  I saw that.  And then Spaz tried to jump over Kevin to punch Rick in the head, 
[02:57:30]  and that's when he knocked the clock off the wall.  The white guy...  I just went flying.  The white guy's not bleeding, so I give the win to Spaz.  You don't look like Chuck Webner after all.  On the judges' cards, I got to give it to Rick.  Yeah, Rick.  He went in hard with a bunch of body blows,  and then when Kevin was down, he hit him in the forehead.  The boxing gloves brought to you by the new morning show, Scott and Sid.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Cool. 
[02:58:00]  We need all the help in the world, trust me.  That long roller coaster, the beginning of the roller coaster ride,  where it goes...  There at the bottom.  That's the position they've been given by the Manson and Kaczynski morning show.  Right.  That's funny.  That was great.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  I think old Dirty just found a job.  Clock, yo.  Clock, yo.  Change the time, though.  It's not 6.15 anymore.  Yeah, I know.  Who cares?  Cool.  The clock, hands frozen in time, when Spaz knocked it off the wall. 
[02:58:30]  A haunting reminder.  6.51, yo.  There you go.  Holy Jesus.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Out of your friggin' mind.  Tomorrow's show is going to be a mess, too,  because I think it's somebody's birthday around here.  Somebody's.  I forgot about that.  That's right.  I want the tie sheets.  That wasn't my birthday.  I know.  So tomorrow's show will be just as messy. 
[02:59:00]  And you'll have no idea what we have in store for.  Award-winning afternoon drive.  Yeah, let's thank all the listeners again.  Thank you very much.  You guys are obviously a huge part of this show.  And we're all going to celebrate a privilege, Anthony.  Right now, we're headed down to privilege.  We'll be there in hopefully a half hour, 23rd Street and 11th Avenue.  Enjoy some beers, boobs.  Wonderful.  And buffet.  Beers, boobs, buffet.  The three B's.  And maybe a boxing match.  Oh, what? 
[02:59:30]  You bringing the gloves?  21 and over.  Free buffet.  First beer on us, Anthony.  Head down there.  Head down there.  And no cover charge.  Okay?  Right.  We'll see you guys down there, hopefully within a half hour.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  That, too.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  O.B. and Anthony.  I, I, I, I.  This is, this is debauchery mania.  I, I, I, I.  Prostate exams for everyone.  I, I, I, I.  1-1-1-2-7, WNEW. </pre>
