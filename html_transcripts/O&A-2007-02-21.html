<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off course from one subject to the next.  The show began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, expressing considerable anxiety over the impending Sirius and XM merger, fueled by the fact that the new CEO, Mel Karmazin, had previously fired them.  Their concerns were exacerbated by perceived passive-aggressive behavior from their manager, John Minnelli, particularly his forwarding of an email from Karmazin that conspicuously omitted any mention of their show. This was further compounded by Minnelli's generally negative feedback on their performance.  A caller, Chris, even rang in to call them "horrible" and demand their removal from the airwaves, a request the hosts humorously manipulated into having him turn off the show permanently.

The conversation then shifted to a discussion of Van Halen’s postponed reunion tour and David Lee Roth's declining performance abilities, sparking a humorous bet between Anthony and Tom Chiusano (present in the studio) regarding Roth's and Sammy Hagar's respective album sales (Tom correctly predicted the outcome).  This segued into further banter about Tom's new braces.

The show then moved to a discussion about the hosts' future job security post-merger, further fueled by silence from Karmazin and Minnelli's emails. This spurred into a prolonged, vulgar mockery of Bubba the Love Sponge, with repeated use of the derogatory term "Fatso," criticisms of his radio style, and speculation about his motivations for aligning with Howard Stern.  Extensive and mocking impersonations of Bubba’s voice were included.  This segment also featured the recurring character "Boardroom Jimmy," delivering a series of absurd, offensive, homophobic, and racist financial pronouncements and stock market commentary.

Opie shared an anecdote about being pulled over for speeding by a fan, and the hosts discussed home security measures following Opie’s near-home invasion.  Mention was made of a new audio clip they'd produced, and the upcoming MacBook karaoke contest tied to American Idol.

The show then analyzed a tense moment during an *American Idol* broadcast featuring a clash between Simon Cowell and Ryan Seacrest, where Cowell repeatedly called Seacrest "sweetheart." The hosts dissected the interaction, speculating on the genuine nature of Cowell’s dislike for Seacrest and deriding Seacrest's job as easy.  A "chubbier kid" contestant's interaction with Cowell was also discussed, as was Cowell’s alleged past involvement with the Teletubbies. This transitioned into brainstorming for a "Crazy Chick Day" segment, soliciting ideas from listeners, including “Toe Sucker from Queens,” whose sexually explicit rhyme spurred a lengthy discussion on foot fetishes.  Numerous caller suggestions, scheduling conflicts, and off-color humor were included in this segment.

A significant portion was dedicated to Anna Nicole Smith's death and the subsequent legal proceedings involving Howard K. Stern.  The hosts and callers reacted to video footage showing Smith appearing intoxicated and erratic, and discussed Stern’s testimony.  Vulgar and offensive language was used extensively.  This discussion branched into unrelated topics, including a gas line explosion caught on police dashcam footage; a purported mythical creature sighting in Massachusetts;  the cruel methods of fur harvesting in China, prompting a debate on animal cruelty and meat consumption; and the experience of using horse-drawn carriages in New York City.  A significant portion also focused on graphic and humorous descriptions of defecation.  Multiple callers contributed, including Les the Trucker (who commented on a judge's voice), Brian from New York (who shared gossip from the Preston and Steve show), and Mike from Iowa (who debated Anthony on the feasibility of a vegetarian national diet).

The broadcast concluded with a segment heavily focused on graphic bathroom humor.  The discussion included detailed descriptions of feces and anal sex,  with caller Jason the trucker recounting a particularly graphic anecdote.  Lori, a caller, described defecating in a bag while driving a truck and even proceeded to defecate into a bag live on the air, describing the process and sounds.  "Boardroom Jimmy" returned with more profane and outrageous financial commentary.  The show also briefly touched on a listener in Chicago shaving her head bald for charity, mirroring Britney Spears, and concluded with a selection of "line of the day" contenders.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  A war in the world.  Exempt to appear.  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  No!  Oh, God!  Ow!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Opie.  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton.  Look at this face. How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Bagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Bagel. 
[00:00:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Bagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  There's your wake-up siren. 
[00:01:00]  Shh. Good morning.  Wake up.  We're the gentle waker up our show.  Hey. Hey. Hey, you.  Get up.  It's time to wake up.  Don't hit the snooze alarm.  Oh, look at you.  Oh, look at you.  Wow.  The blanket's not covering you fully.  Look what I get to see.  Meow. 
[00:01:30]  Ha ha ha ha.  The old slip up the cover before you leave the house.  Meow.  See you later, sweetie pie.  Aw.  All right.  Time to wake up, everybody.  Get up.  It's wakey time.  Hey, Gop.  Get up.  Get up.  That is odd.  It happens like right at six.  Right when people's alarms go off, they're like, ah, what is this?  Ah. 
[00:02:00]  That stupid snooze alarm thing never works.  Just get up.  Just get it over with.  Come on.  We'll wait.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Do it.  You're going to hit it.  And then it's going to seem like you never hit it.  Yeah.  It's just going to, oh, it's going off again.  Oh, God.  That's not enough sleep.  The snooze alarm just, you have to wake up five, six different times.  Yeah.  Prolong the misery.  But you're going through the misery six times instead of one time.  Instead of one. 
[00:02:30]  Just get up.  Get it over with.  Do what I do.  Alarm goes off.  I jump out of bed.  Curse the world.  That's it.  Just curse.  And I love the world.  I really do.  But getting up at 4.15 is a lot to curse.  Yeah.  It's just the hours.  Yeah.  It's not the gig.  Like, I love the job.  But, God, that getting up early, you just kind of, you do.  You sit at the edge of the bed and just mumble the worst string of curses. 
[00:03:00]  It's pitch black.  I'm going to start recording myself as soon as I wake up.  I got to do it in a way where somehow I got to forget that.  I'm recording myself so I get some real natural audio.  Yeah.  Because some of the stuff I say is just, it's just criminal.  It's just criminal.  Well, me too.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show, the O.P. and Anthony show, the O.N.A. virus.  We are spreading it across America.  Yes, indeed.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:03:30]  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  And we just got to follow our hearts and continue doing the O.P. and Anthony show.  Because too many people are getting in our heads.  Because they're getting their hands in the soup.  We're trying to, anyway.  Trying to.  I don't know what this John Minnelli wants from this radio show.  I think he wants some kind of political-based radio show.  I think he's trying to build like the old ABC or something.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know.  I don't know what he wants anymore. 
[00:04:00]  We had a lot of fun with Tyre Banks yesterday.  And he sent out an email to Steve like,  isn't there something better you guys could find to goof on or whatever?  And when we misquote him, we get in trouble.  And then there's another email that comes.  But what is the email, Steve?  I had fun with Tyre Banks yesterday.  I'm looking on my Blackberry.  I don't know what to tell this guy.  I really don't.  Steve, can't the Sound Hunters, they're now called Sound Hunters.  I am Sound Hunter. 
[00:04:30]  These guys are called Sound Hunters now?  They come out in loincloths with spears.  Can't the Sound Hunters come up with more than this tired old bit?  And, of course, the subject, Tyre Banks.  Only a tiny percentage of young or old guys watch her show.  She is not a significant personality in her own right.  Hearing a whole hour spin on her anniversary comments yesterday was aching.  And for all intents and purposes to having to endure the philosophy of the first bank teller we could find. 
[00:05:00]  John.  I hate, I hate explaining this crap.  Because it speaks for itself.  We know what we did.  We know what the people think.  But I hate explaining this.  But this is the guy they want us to listen to.  I know.  When I talk to the bigwigs, how's it going with John?  You guys are talking to John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John.  I can't talk to John if he doesn't get the basics of radio. 
[00:05:30]  We're not talking about Tyre because the whole world is watching the Tyre Banks show.  Don't you get it?  And we're not doing it in the context of talking about her show like, hey, did you see Tyre yesterday?  Here's what she talked about.  Here's what she presented.  Here's the – we're goofing on her.  Like, in the past, you were able to goof on people like Kathy Lee Gifford.  And believe me, she is, was, and always has been completely out of this demo. 
[00:06:00]  The whole demo of, you know, young men, whatever the hell we're supposed to be hitting.  But did that make it less entertaining to listen to her be ragged on?  No.  It's the angle you take on it.  If we were sitting here talking about Tyre's show in a serious manner, I would absolutely agree.  That's ridiculous.  But to show anybody, anyone, I don't even care if she's not a celebrity. 
[00:06:30]  If we had audio of just some anonymous woman being so self-centered.  Talking about herself.  Talking about herself and how she is celebrating Black History Month by talking about her own nothing achievement.  That's entertaining.  That's funny.  It's ridiculous.  It's fodder to goof on.  Yeah.  Not talking about her show.  Does he think we're just talking about the Tyra Banks show, like promoting it or something? 
[00:07:00]  He didn't understand how unbelievable that was, that because she was the first black woman on the cover of the swimsuit issue for Sports Illustrated, that that's a big, big moment in black history?  Yeah.  And that's one of the main reasons why we goofed on her.  And then she's talking to herself about a pimple, and you don't think that would be entertaining to people out there?  Oh, no.  We're talking about it again.  Are we going to get another email?  Well, here, and then this philosophy, like most of the people don't listen to the Tyra Banks show. 
[00:07:30]  I'll tell you right now, man.  All right.  American Idol.  American Idol is probably the biggest show on TV right now, right?  We could do a whole break on American Idol right now, and most of the people listening to this radio show did not see American Idol last night.  It's just a fact.  Who cares?  All right.  And then he would probably argue that, well, men don't watch American Idol.  All right, pick something that guys do watch, and I guarantee that more people listening right now did not watch that particular program.  It's just how it is.  So you as the radio host, John, you got to bring everyone in. 
[00:08:00]  Bring them in.  Bring them in.  And I think we did a fine job yesterday bringing everyone into the goof how ridiculous Tyra Banks is.  With the sound clips and then our comments on it.  I hate his managing style.  I really do.  It's not working with us.  You have to try a different approach.  Because then he writes this.  Like everyone yesterday was talking about the merger between the two satellite radio companies. 
[00:08:30]  And I know they're not too thrilled with us talking about that over here when we're on regular radio as well.  And I understand that.  It's not to promote.  It's just news.  But it was massive, massive news yesterday, okay?  And it's going to be massive news as we move forward here.  And we're wondering, you know, what our futures are going to be like.  It affects us.  It certainly affects us.  Because the guy who's going to run the new company is the guy that fired us like four, four and a half years ago.  We haven't talked to him since.  Right.  He was the guy that fired us for Sex for Sam. 
[00:09:00]  He's also very, very good friends with Howard Stern.  See, I'm over-explaining because John really needs us to over-explain everything now.  Okay?  And everyone knows that we do not get along with Howard for many, many, many reasons, okay?  Yeah.  That, you know, we don't want to bore the audience with by rehashing again.  So we're a little nervous.  I'm not going to lie to you.  We don't know what's going to happen for this radio show as far as our satellite careers go.  I mean, we could be just fine or we could be just, like, kicked out the door. 
[00:09:30]  He could be holding a grudge.  We don't know.  You never know with mergers.  We never – we don't know.  But we know this.  We're not on the greatest terms with Mel Carmers.  And we haven't talked to him in almost five years.  And everyone knows how we feel about Howard.  So with that said, this is what John sends me yesterday.  I'm like, what are you doing?  If you want to play this game, I'll play it with you.  It's easy for me.  He sent it to me, Anthony, and Jim Norton from John Minnelli. 
[00:10:00]  Subject, exciting merger news from Sirius, okay?  He forwards an email that Mel Carmers has sent to the entire staff at Sirius, okay?  And basically the email is talking about how excited he is about this merger between the two companies  and that both companies have unbelievable programming.  And he mentions the programming of Sirius, including Howard Stern and football and hockey.  And then he mentions XM and mentions baseball and Oprah and Bob Dylan  and basically mentioning all the top programs between the two companies. 
[00:10:30]  With one glaring omission.  With one glaring omission.  And we know why there's a glaring omission because there's a problem here, okay?  We get that.  And John knows.  John knows this stuff probably better than anyone.  So he forwards the email that Mel sent the staff and then writes,  O-A-N-N, guess who's conspicuous by their absence in Mel's letter?  John.  Yeah.  What are you trying to accomplish with this, John? 
[00:11:00]  Are you trying to get in our heads?  Are you trying to make us paranoid?  What is your goal here?  Because that's all he writes.  So then I scroll down and I read this terrific email that Mel sent out to everybody.  And I'm like, wow, that really does blow that the guy decided to not mention us  and make believe we don't even exist.  So that would get in our heads a little bit.  But we don't need John Minnelli forwarding this to us.  By the way, this was forwarded by other people. 
[00:11:30]  And the little email that was sent with it was a lot better than guess who's conspicuous by their absence in Mel's letter.  John.  Like, what is he doing?  It's become a passive-aggressive relationship.  It's not even about being informative.  It's just about being a dick and throwing jabs.  And you can say, deny that all you want.  But, you know, it's like we're grown men.  And it's like just admit that it's at least a passive-aggressive relationship.  Yeah, it seems to be this.  When you're sending emails like that and you're forwarding them like that and saying things like that, that's what it is. 
[00:12:00]  And it doesn't get in my head on a different subject about Mel not mentioning the show.  Don't mention the show.  No one likes us.  Don't mention it.  What am I going to tell you?  Yeah.  Don't.  We've done this our whole career, by the way.  Yeah.  We've not been liked.  Yeah, well.  But I don't need John Minnelli forwarding that to me with his little comment.  I get it, John.  I get it.  And you already got it.  You know where we stand with Mel.  So what?  What are you telling me that I don't know? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, what's being accomplished there?  Yeah.  How is that helping the Opie and Anthony show and as far as us doing it for CBS radio?  How is that helping us?  You critique our breaks on, like, Tyra and stuff.  And we'll critique your emails.  That's what I do.  Nothing but a negative email that does nothing to help this program.  It just makes us, I don't know, angry at you for sending it.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it. 
[00:13:00]  What happened to you guys are pitiful, a change to you guys are horrible?  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Chris and Redding.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Not much, man.  You guys are horrible, man.  You just need to be taken out of the air.  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, Chris.  Why is that, Chris?  Let me ask you something, all right?  If we're so bad, why are you listening right now?  I never understand that.  Because?  There is a lot of really bad radio out there.  I don't know about it anymore because guess what?  I don't even attempt to listen.  I'll tell you why he's listening.  Why? 
[00:13:30]  Who's off all week, Chris?  Who's off?  Be honest.  Who's off?  Chris, do you realize how ridiculous you sound by calling our show and saying we're horrible?  Do you understand that?  The people that think we're horrible aren't listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  They don't listen.  They just don't listen.  And you know how many people listen to the Opie and Anthony show and don't know our phone number,  would never call the radio program?  You not only listen, you're one of the impressive listeners where you call the radio show. 
[00:14:00]  You've made an effort to call us.  The first time I called to tell you is that I use it really bad, all right?  But you're listening, Chris.  You understand you're listening.  And did you draw that conclusion from just the past ten minutes we've actually been talking about a subject, one subject?  Is that where you drew the conclusion, Chris?  No, no.  How did you draw the conclusion?  How much have you listened?  Because you guys really think you can replace Howard Stern.  These are crazy.  Yeah, we're really crazy. 
[00:14:30]  You didn't answer the question.  How long did you take the conclusion?  You didn't answer the question, and you obviously have the agenda.  We know that Howard's hardcore fans, whichever ones are left, don't like us.  So there's no surprise here, Chris.  You're one of these guys that sound like you're from like 1990, and you call up, and you got that whole dumb, like it's a dumb voice.  You just, you guys are horrible.  You think you can replace Howard. 
[00:15:00]  And you sound like you're from 1990.  Don't you understand?  You sound like an idiot in this exchange, Chris.  Well, the only idiots are yous.  Yeah, right.  Yous.  The only idiots are yous.  You're helping us right now by showing the type of listener that everybody doesn't want to have.  It's you.  Hey, Chris, do us all.  You're an embarrassment.  Do us all a favor.  I don't think anyone has ever done this on the radio.  We're going to help you.  We're horrible. 
[00:15:30]  You hate us, right?  And I'm not going to hang up on you.  I'm going to do something different.  You really believe we're horrible and we're pathetic and all that, right?  Yep.  Okay.  Walk over to your radio.  Crank it up.  Crank up our show.  Seriously, crank up our show.  It'll be in delay.  It'll be in delay.  And I want to actually hear you turn us off or turn on another show.  And you can pick any show you want.  Go ahead.  Do that.  Go ahead.  We'll help you through this.  And then you never have to listen to us again.  And if plenty of you guys do this, we'll be gone. 
[00:16:00]  And then somebody else will try to make this happen.  That's how it works.  I'll show you how it works.  Here it is.  All right.  We'll walk you through it, Chris.  We're going to walk you through it.  Get to your radio.  Go to your radio.  Turn up our show so we know you have been listening this morning.  All right.  All right.  He's listening to the radio.  Now, Chris.  Now, just change the station to something else.  Anything.  Really insult us.  Make it like Light FM or whoopee or some faggy like dance music station. 
[00:16:30]  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Chris.  All right.  There you go, Chris.  The Mitsubishi commercial.  Chris, you're free.  You're free, Chris.  You never have to hear.  You're free.  How does it feel, buddy?  You never have to hear how horrible we are today.  Freedom!  Too idiot.  That's all you are.  Too idiot.  There you go.  Very good.  We helped you through it.  So, never calls again.  We don't even exist in your world.  All right, Chris? 
[00:17:00]  Have a good day.  The fact...  This is the beauty of this.  I don't get it.  He actually allowed two other men to tell him to get up and cross the room like a good  little boy.  That's every, like...  You guys, you're horrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you guys.  You guys.  You guys.  That makes radio companies cringe when people like that call up and go, I love you guys.  You're the besties. 
[00:17:30]  Because all they see is money going down the drain.  Right.  That's like somebody who would never buy anything.  All right.  So, there you go.  Chris is gone.  One less listener.  One less out.  I figure if we could do that another couple hundred thousand times, we'll be free.  You don't have to worry about it anymore.  We'll be free to spend our money.  And the Chris's of the world can rejoice.  That's right.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  But, you know, once again...  Must be a bitch when you pay all kinds of money and your hero just takes time off. 
[00:18:00]  More time than anyone ever in the history of anything.  That's why what happens is the only time we'll get an occasional...  And believe me, we put them on the air.  We're not one of these shows that just, you know, oh, screen that.  Get them off.  We love putting them on the air.  Yeah.  But it's because it's one, two a day, whatever, at most.  And they usually just make themselves sound really stupid. 
[00:18:30]  And it's only on those days when he's off.  And he's off a lot.  He just takes...  He's off the whole week.  President's week.  I got to take off President's week.  It's a really important week if you're doing a radio show, too.  Because I know our emails are exploding and our message boards are exploding.  Everyone's like, what does this mean for you guys and the show?  So, you know, this is not the week to take off from doing your radio show.  By the way, that Chris guy, guaranteed, and this is what's going to really piss him off,  he is listening to us right now. 
[00:19:00]  Went right back to our show.  What's wrong, Chris?  What's wrong?  Couldn't get enough of us, huh?  You didn't like the Mitsubishi commercial?  Didn't they say disco or something in that ad?  Disco thing?  Disco dealer or something?  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, there you go.  And Ann makes a very good point.  We know there's a bunch of Howard fans out there that just hate our guts.  We'll never turn them around.  We understand that.  They're the hardcore fans that are never, ever going to turn around.  We got the same type of fans.  Yeah.  Same type of fans. 
[00:19:30]  We will turn some of the Howard guys around.  We have.  We see the emails.  They come in.  They trickle in.  I'm not going to say there's a landslide of emails going, oh, my God.  But we turn some people.  And then there's other people we'll never turn.  The hardcore.  It's just how it's going to be.  And we understand that.  But we found our audience a long time ago.  That's why that guy sounded like 1990.  It's just, yeah, you guys.  I'm surprised he didn't throw in a bah, bah, boo-hee.  Let's say hi to Nick in Colorado.  Nick, what's up?  Yeah.  How you doing, guys? 
[00:20:00]  Hey.  I used to be a big fan of John Minnelli.  And I've heard him over the years talk to you guys and everything like that.  I just think John Minnelli's being a passive-aggressive twit by saying, look, guys, if you don't do things my way and the way I think radio should be done, you're not going anywhere because Mel Carmisen is going to get rid of you.  He doesn't want you.  He's trying to say that and imply that to you guys.  And I think you guys ought to just tell John Minnelli, look, this isn't AM radio.  This isn't Rich Limbaugh. 
[00:20:30]  This isn't Bob Grant.  This isn't anything like that.  We know what we're doing.  Let us do our job.  To keep it very honest, I do respect John Minnelli in this business.  I really do.  I don't like his managing style at all because I don't really know what he likes about the Opie and Anthony show anymore.  I don't need my ego stroked.  Ant doesn't need his ego stroked.  Jimmy certainly doesn't need his ego stroked.  But how he handles our show, these emails, before we brought it to your attention, I was getting a lot of these emails where I'd go home and go, wow, man, we really had a good show today. 
[00:21:00]  Ant and I know when we suck.  Trust me.  We look at each other, and Jimmy knows as well.  We look at each other like, oh, my God, just get to 9 o'clock.  This is just an abomination.  Sometimes it's working, and there are days it just sucks.  We are the first to know every single time.  And what's been happening lately, not lately, since John took over, I'll walk home going, man, that was a great show today. 
[00:21:30]  The phones were lit.  People were laughing.  A lot of subjects.  We were laughing.  A lot of subjects.  A lot of interaction.  And then I'll get an email where it's just hated this, hated this, this, this, this, this, nothing positive.  And then I get confused going, well, what the hell?  Does he hate the show?  Yeah.  Does he hate the show?  Because I don't get it.  It becomes a bit nitpicky.  That's why I say it.  But then I confronted him because I do confront people.  I don't just hide behind crap.  And John and I did have a conversation.  I go, John, I don't like your style because I don't know what you want. 
[00:22:00]  I don't know what you like about the show.  And then he kind of admitted as a consultant that that is kind of his style to tell you the stuff that is wrong with the show.  And I'm like, it doesn't work with us.  We need an overall balance here.  Yeah.  Because if I'm reading just what's wrong with the show, I'm going to eventually assume that the show sucks.  That everything sucks.  But he's like, well, I don't feel like I have to tell you the stuff that is working with the show.  And I'm like, yeah, you kind of have to.  Because guess what?  We thought the Tyra thing was terrific yesterday. 
[00:22:30]  Because you're hitting on everything that we think is good.  Right.  Well, just keep doing what you're doing, guys, because it's good.  That's all we can do.  All right, Nick.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye, sweetie.  Yeah, we're in the middle of chaos with the opening of the show.  It's another upheaval.  Yeah, yesterday I was very happy.  Today there's some concerns in my head.  And tomorrow I'll be very happy again.  It's just all over the place.  My whole take on it, there's too much time has to go by to even see if this merger thing is going to happen anyway. 
[00:23:00]  And I can't sit here when it's still freezing cold out in, what is it, still February?  It's going to be in the 40s today.  It's already 42.  It's not even that cold.  But I mean, you know, it's been freezing.  It's still winter, is what I'm saying.  Yeah.  And I can't sit here when, if this deal does go through, it's going to be winter again when it happens.  I'm not going to spend a year toiling over this crap.  No.  So whatever happens, happens. 
[00:23:30]  And screw it.  We'll come in here.  We'll do our show.  And that's what we do.  If the powers that be over there, it's serious.  Mel, whoever else, whatever.  They want to cronies.  They want to all get together and throw us out.  But it's fine.  Whatever happens, happens.  What about the powers that be over here?  They've been unusually quiet through this whole thing.  Well, that's another thing, too.  Except for this one email from John making sure we know that it looks like Mel doesn't really like us still. 
[00:24:00]  It's all corporate.  Thanks, John.  You're an ass.  It's all corporate crap.  So what's going to happen is the people here are going to try to make us feel insecure about our position on satellite.  So it gives them – it's all about leverage.  So it gives them a little more leverage because if we feel insecure about our place at satellite, then they have a better – they have more leverage on what they can do with us. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  And how they can get us and maybe price, things like – just things like that.  It all works out.  It's just business.  It's just – it's business.  That's what this whole thing is.  Satellite radio for about a week and a half wasn't business.  It was like old school FM radio.  You come in.  You have your fun.  You do what you want.  The jocks would – what are we playing on the 70s channel?  I don't know.  I'll pull some of this, that, the other thing.  And for a week it was like that. 
[00:25:00]  And then all of a sudden business, business.  And now with a merger, it's going to become another form of radio with commercials and sales and all that.  And it's just going to – something else is going to have to come out.  Yeah.  Mutate.  All right.  Well, enough of that.  We'll get into some stuff today.  David Lee Roth is a problem.  We got Britt in –  With the Van Halen tour already?  They haven't played a note.  We got the latest on that one. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  We'll stop right here for a minute or two, and we'll be back.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on this fine Whip Him Out Wednesday, by the way.  Yes.  We've got to talk about WOW for the new listeners later on this morning.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Get a WOW sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  Details on opiananthony.com.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe. 
[00:26:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll move on for now.  It is Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  We love WOW.  Hey, where's that girl from last week?  The one with the big giant can.  I don't know.  Yeah, what was her name again?  Does anyone remember?  I don't know.  The fact that she had giant breasts is pretty much all you need to remember.  Yeah.  No, but her bra size was in her name.  Like Jane Triple H or what the hell was it? 
[00:26:30]  Jane what?  Oh, it's in the notes in front of you.  There we go.  Yeah, H. Cup Jane.  I wonder if H. Cup Jane is out there wowing everybody.  And we went to her MySpace account and she should be wowing.  Yeah.  Very, very surprised how nice those big, huge boobies look.  Sometimes you get the big, huge boobies.  They don't look too good.  No, no.  A little sagging.  She's got it going on and she is out there every Wednesday flashing.  Basically, you got to get a wow sticker on your car.  A wow sign, homemade, if you will, on your car or your truck. 
[00:27:00]  Write it.  A lot of dirty cars out there.  Just write it in the dirt on the back of your car.  And that is a sign that you want to see some boobies on the way to work today.  And the girls will do this.  We've been doing this for many, many years.  This promotion pretty much takes care of itself at this point.  Yeah, it works.  So get a wow sticker on your car.  It also supports the show.  Or get a wow sign on your car because I know some of the radio stations don't carry wow stickers, unfortunately.  You mentioned MySpace.  I was talking to this with Bob Kelly when he was in here. 
[00:27:30]  It's just MySpam.  We just call it MySpam.  Have you noticed, Jim?  Yes.  Because I know Jim is very into his MySpace slash Jimmy Norton, is it?  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  I'd hate.  Oh, look.  I just sent a bunch of people to the wrong.  Jimmy sounds like a boy's.  Yes.  Jim Norton on MySpace.  Instead of Anthony Cumia, C-U-M-I-A.  All right.  You don't even accept friends anymore.  You can't be bothered.  You're getting ready for the World Series of Poker, aren't you?  That's true.  But the spam that you get now, me and Bobby were talking about, and Bobby's like, yeah, 
[00:28:00]  I went to the show, and then I come back, and I get these messages from these hot girls, and I click on it, and it's like, hey, I'd like to hook up.  And it's some spam address, and then that stupid, smiley, sunny face, have a sunny day with the sun with the sunglasses on.  I put it on my front page with the circle and the red slash through it and said, if I get this in any message, I will block you.  You will never be able to get in touch with me again. 
[00:28:30]  And the privilege of communicating with me will be taken away, and I will report you as spam.  And I do.  I just sit there blocking people now all day.  You're blocked.  I never get annoyed at the little voice that goes, hello.  Hello.  Do you just want to throw something through the monitor?  I have.  How did MySpace turn into this spam magnet?  I'm on Anthony's MySpace account, and there it is.  Any message is with this sunny day crap or any other spam, and the sender will be blocked from sending me anything else. 
[00:29:00]  Don't be a spamming, can you say that word over here, d-head?  D-head.  Right.  Yeah, you know.  And right under that.  Richard.  And if you haven't checked out Anthony's MySpace account yet, you really need to just to see the video that Anthony made.  I put a lot of videos on my site.  You made that with your Mac, right, Ant?  Of course I did.  It's Anthony Cumia, C-U-M-I.  But right under that message is the video of Anthony at his computer just kind of looking into a screen. 
[00:29:30]  And then another Anthony walks into the room and is looking over Anthony's shoulder.  One Anthony looking over the other Anthony's shoulder.  It is really, really creepy.  I've seen videos like this, and they don't look real.  Yours looks real, ridiculously real.  Yeah, it's got a real creepy-looking, grainy, like, webcam look to it in the dark.  And I'm sitting there, and then I just come around a corner.  It's the second me, and I look over my own shoulder.  But you walk into the room like a zombie toward the other Anthony. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, I wanted it to look really creepy.  Know what you should do?  You should redo this and just have a different outfit on.  Oh, I was thinking that, too, yeah.  Because you're wearing the same thing, which maybe takes you out of it a little bit.  Yeah.  But maybe just a different shirt or something.  Well, funny you say that.  I am working on another one, like you said, with my wonderful Mac.  And I'm going to pick up something.  The one guy sitting down, the one me sitting down, pick something up, maybe even a bottle of soda or something, as usual. 
[00:30:30]  Just drink out of it, put it down.  And then the other guy will come up, look, pick up the same thing.  Oh, wow.  And drink out of it and walk away.  So there's a little more interaction between the two me's.  Yeah.  Anthony was telling us off air, too, that your basement looks downright creepy at this point.  I have a complete green screen set up now downstairs.  Just got the lighting that I had ordered.  So I could do some green screening and cut out things from the background and layer them over other moving or photos. 
[00:31:00]  And I'm still learning a lot of this stuff.  I love doing video.  Love it.  That's why, you know, the video contest that we're putting on, has that been announced?  Is that up on a website?  Yeah, it's up on opandanthony.com.  Yeah.  But I can't enter because I'm one of the judges.  But you were telling me that some people came over to your house and you're giving them the tour.  Yeah, yeah.  And you get to the basement and it looks like you're filming porn or something down there. 
[00:31:30]  Snuff or porn or something.  I know because there's lighting and a big green screen.  Not just.  It's real creepy.  Not just lighting like any other Joe Schmo would have.  No, it's like stage lighting down there.  I don't even know where you go to get the type of lighting you get.  I go online.  You got to go to like the movie store.  Yeah, it's the movie store.  You go to the same store like Steven Spielberg's people go to.  I buy a dolly and a crane.  I'm doing crane shots.  You should have all kids toys. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, God.  How creepy would that be?  Really creepy.  And like blacked out curtains in the window.  Yeah.  That would really be a creepy thing to do.  Uncle Anthony's place.  Little toys with the letters on them stacked up.  Not spelling anything.  Well, we look forward to your next video.  Your Vista video, by the way.  We haven't talked about it in a while.  It's unbelievable what's going on with that video of yours.  That was my problem on my PC that I had loading up my Vista.  So I did an installation.  It was, I think, something like a two-second Vista installation and installed it into my paper shredder. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And then now the comments have reached just they love it or total hatred for me and what an idiot I am.  How can it tell you?  And requests, can I please have the key number that came with the desk?  That's the only three things that happen now.  Dude, it's so cool.  Max rule.  I don't even know why you even bother with a PC.  And then there's the guys that are like, this noob is such a dork. 
[00:33:00]  You can't even load it up.  It worked fine on my system.  Well, it didn't work on mine.  That's what's funny because.  On mine that said Vista ready all over it.  Yeah, we know you're not a noob.  That's what makes this real.  No.  A lot of fun for us to read the comments.  But a lot of these comments are from all over the world.  So how can you tell what they're saying if they love you or hate you?  Some of them are.  It's in languages I've never.  I don't recognize.  Yep.  You recognize the German and this and that.  But there are other languages.  You're like, where is that? 
[00:33:30]  And then.  Are we in the same world as that person?  The hell.  And then because I like I like, you know, doing a lot of video.  So I put a lot of video on my space and I got me in the Lamborghini, me and a friend in the Lamborghini.  That's going to remain nameless doing 135 miles an hour on the Ocean Parkway, which was a lot of fun.  And that video is up.  Also, like people when they put their favorite movies, they just list their movies and that's boring.  So I made little widescreen versions of all the movies that I like. 
[00:34:00]  So it's got little clips of Caddyshack.  It's got I'll find myself a new greenskeeper.  Is that clear?  Like that clips on there without sound.  But you could definitely tell me.  We can figure it out.  Sure.  The Warriors are up there and Pulp Fiction and stuff.  I just love throwing a bunch of video up there.  But the Vista video where you loaded it into a shredder.  And we love Opie and Anthony videos.  I think the faithful listeners know that by now.  Your Vista video is like the number one Opie and Anthony video now on Break.com and on YouTube. 
[00:34:30]  On Break.com alone, it's been viewed 1.1 million times.  Jesus.  On YouTube, it's up to 534,000 times.  Nice.  That's crazy.  People have been linking it on a bunch of geek sites and stuff.  Just to put it in perspective, Bill Burr taking on the audience last summer during the ONA traveling virus where he just beat up Philly for, what, a half hour straight?  And it's on video and it made it to YouTube. 
[00:35:00]  That was the number one Opie and Anthony video for a very long time.  That got about 150,000 views.  Your video is now number one at 534,000 views on YouTube.  And growing by the day.  Oh, yeah.  It got hit like 25,000 times yesterday.  Amazing.  All right.  Hey, Van Halen news.  A lot of people were very excited about Van Halen getting back together.  I never liked them.  Never.  Van Halen, man.  No incarnation.  Didn't love Van Halen.  I mean, they were a good band.  I just never. 
[00:35:30]  See, and by the way, we got to make this interesting because right now, as we talk about Van Halen, there are more people listening right now.  You know, John Minnelli that could care less about Van Halen than, you know, do care about Van Halen.  That's true.  That's just the reality of doing a radio show.  So you have to try to bring everyone in.  It's our job now.  But we did say this.  We said this would never work.  We said that David Lee Roth is lost.  He can't pull off the old David Lee Roth.  I loved David Lee Roth back in the day. 
[00:36:00]  I couldn't get enough of him as a front man.  He was unbelievable.  When Van Halen first came out, he was the consummate front man for a rock band.  That was what you watched and went like, okay, that's how it's done.  But over the years, he started losing his hair.  But then he started doing, like, comb-overs.  Whatever.  People lose their hair.  But he was one of these guys that couldn't handle it.  So he had a swooping comb-over for a while.  It didn't work.  And then his clothes went away.  And then we saw him on that, what was it, the Grammys or the MTV Music Awards. 
[00:36:30]  With that big dopey smile.  Big dopey smile on his pants.  Pulled almost up to his nipples.  You know, there's problems there.  He's not the same David Lee Roth.  And we said that when the news broke that these guys were going to try it again.  We're like, there's no way the guy could pull it off.  He just can't, unfortunately.  I would love to go see Van Halen again, of course, with David Lee Roth.  I can't wait to see the police.  Can't wait.  But the news came out yesterday.  Van Halen reunion tour postponed indefinitely.  Ah, they're done.  Yeah, plus the fact that he can't be the old David Lee Roth anymore. 
[00:37:00]  They just hate each other.  Yeah.  They've hated each other for many, many years.  They probably hated each other when they were on top of the world.  They can't even hold it together for a big payday.  No.  That's how much they hate each other.  No.  They know it would be huge.  Like, they pack places out.  Well, it's breaking news.  Was it too good to be true?  And Polestar is reporting that the much-hyped Van Halen reunion tour with David Lee Roth has  already fallen through and is now officially postponed indefinitely. 
[00:37:30]  They've been trying to get this together.  You know that video of them going on that stage with David Lee Roth?  With his pants pulled up to his nipples?  I think that's 10 years ago.  Yeah.  10 years ago, they were flirting with David Lee Roth coming back into the band.  Yep.  Maybe even more.  Maybe someone can look that up.  But at least 10 years ago.  And they just can't get this done.  No.  Sources tell the tour magazine that a tour announcement may have not been far off.  And just last week, Rolling Stone posted excerpts from an upcoming interview with Roth about 
[00:38:00]  the reunion, which is slated for its next issue.  The magazine's website also unveiled the first ever group shot of the current lineup of the  band, including Eddie Van Halen, his brother Alex, and of course, Eddie's son Wolfgang  on bass.  Sources also tell Denver's Rocky Mountain News that Van Halen's performance at next month's  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, because they were going to play there, because they're  getting inducted finally, may also be in jeopardy.  What incarnation is being inducted? 
[00:38:30]  David Lee Roth?  Or like the whole thing?  How does that work, if they get a new singer?  Everybody?  It was going to be everybody on that stage?  So they were all going to be there?  Well, yeah.  The reality is, Sammy Hagar sold more records than the David Lee Roth version.  I thought they were awful with him.  I know they were popular.  They were huge with Hagar.  I know.  I do.  I know.  I thought they were awful.  What's like the big song?  A million albums.  Could this be love?  They had a bunch of hits.  They had a bunch of hits. 
[00:39:00]  I know.  A million.  We could play excerpts of 10 to 12 hits.  And Opa was saying in the office how dated the Sammy Hagar stuff is.  Like, you could still hear the David Lee Roth Van Halen on a classic rock station or something.  You get any, like, Jamie's crying, running with the devil on one of these rock stations,  although there's no rock station here in New York anymore.  It's not going to sound like it came out yesterday, but, you know, it's definitely still listened.  You could still listen to it.  It's timeless.  And it's not, like, just nostalgic. 
[00:39:30]  But the Sammy Hagar stuff is just, oof.  It's got late 80s written all over it.  Terrible.  Terrible.  He's, like, wearing a bandana.  It's very bandana.  I mean, just want to get the sweat in your eyes, Sam.  Douche.  What's up, Jarvis?  I'm throwing the t-shirts out in the audience all the time.  And Tom just wanted you to know that you're wrong.  And David Lee Roth doubled Sammy Hagar's total. 
[00:40:00]  No.  Tom?  Oh, wow.  Nice fight.  No way.  Fight.  Fight.  I said they get out.  Dude, get out.  In the squared circle.  Who sold more records?  Both of you's naked.  I've always read that Hagar's...  So have I, Tom.  Where's your knowledge come from?  I hope Tom is right because I hate Hagar.  Where's your knowledge coming from?  Tom, I think David Lee Roth told you that when he was here.  I know you love the guy, but we're not beating him up.  Why don't you stand here?  What are you doing over there?  No, he needs to be over there.  All right.  In that case, I'll go over here. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, boy.  Now he's too close to me.  Where's your info coming from?  I'm telling you.  What do you want to bet?  A day of golf?  I'll bet you 50 bucks.  Of course.  You don't want to play golf with me.  I'll bet around 50 bucks and a round of golf.  How about that?  50 bucks.  You're saying...  50 bucks and a round of golf.  Well, how are we going to find out?  Where do you get your knowledge from?  Polestar.  So you're saying that David Lee Roth sold more records than the Sammy Hagar version.  Yes.  Ah, no.  Well, then there is a greatest hit CD.  Oh, boy. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, no.  Are we talking greatest hits?  No, no, no.  I'm talking...  I think Van Roth versus Van Hagar.  Van Roth doubled the CD sales of Van Hagar.  I've always heard that Van Hagar sold more records.  Yeah, more than...  I've always heard the opposite.  And you both have mics in front of you, so this is very...  We're both experts.  You're both experts.  But he's older, so he's an older expert.  I actually heard it was Gary Cherone.  That for sure isn't true.  That for sure isn't true.  I would not throw my 50 bucks in, Jim. 
[00:41:30]  Why?  With that bet.  Cherone sold 400 records on a good market.  All right, now we've got a bet.  We've got to figure this out.  We've got a record staff working on it.  Record company, Jim.  Did you look this up before you came into the studio?  No, I did not.  All right.  Oh, good.  That's the information I've always had.  I had the info the other day, man.  Well, let's see.  Someone will find this during a break.  We'll look it up.  They've got something called the internet these days.  Info all over this thing.  All over it.  The what?  It's called the internet.  And you go to certain things called websites, and info just jumps at you, along with pornography. 
[00:42:00]  Mel call you yet?  No.  No.  No?  Oh, my God.  No.  I'm very happy right where I am.  You know what?  There are a few people in the world that I like more than I like and respect more than respect him.  All right.  I can't wait for the call.  Tom, yeah, we could use a man like you over here.  So long, guys.  X-Serious Radio, M, whenever we're going to call it.  Oh, we've seen it all before. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, it'll just be great.  All the boys will be together again.  And you, maybe Ken Stevens.  Well, maybe not Ken.  Yeah, maybe not Ken, but you and Tim Savian.  Tim Savian.  All he is can go to the big managers meetings again.  And the sales staff of a medium that wasn't supposed to have commercials.  And, oh, it's just going to be fantastic.  I've got to go work on the Van Roth Van Hager.  Yeah, please bring in.  We need it in a spreadsheet form. 
[00:43:00]  Could you do a PowerPoint presentation?  He's out of here.  There goes Tom and his braces.  I love it.  He actually just got me.  It's really aggravating.  He got you?  Yes, he sauntered out of the room.  Oh, he said, Jim?  Yes, looking svelte and fashionable.  I can't take anything he says seriously because of those braces.  He's got braces!  He should just draw, like, three little freckles on each cheek.  It'll look like a little boy.  Dude, everyone knows I'm in my early 30s now. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, wow.  And my dentist, for at least five years, said, you know, you could get your bottom row straightened.  Yeah?  You just need a little braces.  I'm like, I'm too old for braces.  Apparently not.  But Tom has no problem with it, and he's older than us.  Maybe his chewing is bothering him.  Sometimes that happens, too.  If your chewing starts to bother you, you decide to fix it.  No, it's not that.  I think it's just vanity.  He'll just, he'll just, he'll just, he'll just, he'll get, he'll get, he'll get it.  Eventually, the braces will come off, he'll have wonderful straight white teeth, and we'll have the last laugh. 
[00:44:00]  The first time we sat with Tom Chiasano, which is after we got fired from Boston, and we came down, and we were trying to figure out where we were going next, and we sat in his office, he was American Psycho.  Just dark hair, perfect haircut.  He had a tan.  Remember his suits?  I use a special exfoliating cream.  He was American Psycho, dude.  He really was.  Very intimidating.  He's having a cry, he's going to have pec implants next. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  Pectoral implants.  He's not as intimidating, because he's got the braces.  What, is he going to yell at us with the braces on?  He could.  If he fires us when he's still wearing braces, I'm going to laugh my ass off.  I'm going to laugh right at him.  Piece of sandwich hits you in the head.  I'm going to go, we just got fired by a guy that has braces.  He'll yell and fire you, but in his left hand, he'll be holding like a swirly lollipop.  One of those all-day suckers.  Yeah, a big giant one with just like little swirly circles in it. 
[00:45:00]  And when he's angry, he takes one bite out of it, and it's the shape of a bite.  All right.  You two have done nothing.  Lick.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  Yeah.  What's up, John?  How's it going, man?  How you doing?  All right.  I just wanted to call and just say, you know, after Howard Stern, I was really happy that  you guys were on the air, but I have to say, this has been a royal disappointment.  Oh, royal.  You absolutely suck. 
[00:45:30]  All right, then.  You suck, and you ruin my commute every day.  All you do is dick.  Oh, my gosh.  I can tell right now that he's going to say Ramon, or he's going to say Frankus.  All right, John.  Go ahead.  I don't know what to tell you.  We're on to you.  So, anyway, I just had to say that.  I wish you guys would do more of the Ronald Reagan and Dice and all that, because that  shit was stuffless.  Whoa, hey.  And now look what you're doing.  Hey, hey.  Now you're potty-mouthing.  All right, John.  There goes John.  Another one that hates us. 
[00:46:00]  We live in the past.  But he's listening.  But how great is it that his commute is ruined?  Just keep listening in traffic, dope.  Wait till you hear Boardroom Jimmy later on this morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  I love showing my introverted fat guys.  We whip them out Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus.  Coming this weekend on XM 202, it's a Saturday Night Virus double feature. 
[00:46:30]  This Saturday from 9 to 11 p.m., it's the return of the Fan and Sam Show.  And from 11 p.m. to midnight, it's Big Kev's Geek Stuff.  It all happens this Saturday night on XM 202.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out this morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I know Tom is listening down the hall.  Tom, stay in your seat.  Because I can't do it to your face. 
[00:47:00]  Tom is right.  Oh.  Oh, he's right.  Ugh.  That means things are...  That should be correct.  That makes you feel better just for life in general than Ruff sold more than...  Rupert, we were wrong.  You were right.  Tom Chiusano, with his braces, is correct.  Correct.  Ben Halen sold many more albums with David Lee Roth than they did with Sammy Hagar. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, I hate being wrong.  You're a little factoid.  Oh, I hate it.  Was wrong.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  I guess Bubba the Love Sponge was talking about us.  Well, the two camps, I guess, now.  There's some head-butting going on.  Even though this is a supposed merger that may or may not take place. 
[00:48:00]  With the satellite radio companies.  We're in chaos right now.  You've got to bear with us a little bit.  But we're used to it.  We're a little distracted.  We're used to it as a show.  This has been our whole career.  It has been exactly like this.  The second you start feeling like maybe you could maybe get a little comfortable, wham.  They smack in your head with a sledgehammer.  And that's pretty much what's going on with this satellite merger.  Oh, Tom.  Tom, we've got to move on.  Tom is putting his thumbs in his ears and shaking his fingers at you. 
[00:48:30]  Making moose horns.  Did I just get a na-na-na-na?  You got a na-na-na-na-na.  Here, stay over there.  Oh, yes?  Yes, Tom.  Didn't we have a bet?  That was a $50 bet.  I don't have any money on it.  Okay, just as long as we acknowledge the bet.  I'm going to give you $50.  No problem.  Later.  You don't have to do it now.  There it is.  I got $4.  And you know Tom's the type of guy that'll just send it to his favorite charity.  Absolutely.  He won't accept that.  Yeah, but if I don't pay within a week, I'll get a pass due. 
[00:49:00]  No, it'll be $52 then.  Yeah, of course it will be.  Garnish your paycheck.  He's got a whole staff that'll start sending out memos and threatening letters.  Your credit rating will be ruined.  What happened?  Well, remember that dumb bet with Tom Chiesbato?  But now I can't buy a house.  My mortgage rate is so high.  It is one of the interesting things about the best of.  They did.  It was two to one.  And the best of, if you look at that double CD, they're evenly split. 
[00:49:30]  I think it's 32 songs, 16, 16, or 15, 15, 31 with the one instrumental.  Right, right.  And there's no picture of DLR on that double CD.  Hmm.  Yeah, because they hate them.  Yeah.  You know why they hate them.  They hate them for the same reasons you hate them.  I don't hate them.  I don't hate them at all.  No one gets along with the guy.  Are you kidding?  I don't hate them.  Tom is just terrific, isn't he?  No, no.  Listen, we had a difficult relationship, but I don't hate them. 
[00:50:00]  I don't.  All right, hate's a strong word.  I understand that.  He's an eclectic gentleman who had different ideas.  It's kind of difficult to talk to.  I've talked to him before.  And he just kind of talks, and then he goes off on these weird tangents, and then you  just laugh.  When he starts to laugh, you're like, oh, it's time to chime in with a laugh.  With a laugh.  No conversation, really.  It's like blah, blah, blah, blah, babble, babble.  It's a one-sided conversation.  It's awful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At different times.  I mean, there were times when he was absolutely delightful to be with and fun. 
[00:50:30]  All right, we get it.  What harsh language, Tom.  Tom doesn't want to trash anybody.  We know your MO.  We know your MO at this point.  How do you think you have a job like this for this many years?  How do you think you survive, what, 30 years, 25 years?  What are you up to?  With this company?  Yeah.  Well, with this company, at least 20.  25 years.  25 years.  Okay.  That's why.  See, we've got to learn how to just keep our mouths shut.  No, no.  We really do.  Uh-uh.  You want to be management?  No, it ain't just rolling over and dying.  No. 
[00:51:00]  No.  No, no, no.  But it's just being diplomatic.  Like, there's a guy who you want to strangle right now for what he did to this, and you just  called him delightful.  Yeah.  No, I said at times.  No, no, no.  Good point, Jimmy.  I said at times.  My teeth really hurt today.  I've got to go.  All right.  All right.  Go clean out your braces.  Use a little aura gel?  I got the new bar yesterday.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  When you see me with rubber bands on my teeth.  Yeah.  He's got to do the rubber bands like a 14-year-old girl.  Yeah.  My niece has braces, too.  This is downright creepy.  I can't wait until he's trying to be serious talking to us, and a rubber band shoots out 
[00:51:30]  of his mouth.  Or the spittle collects from the corner of your mouth.  That's always attractive.  Yeah.  What do you got to keep a white thing?  Yeah.  Where are we going to lunch again?  Wonderful.  Remember when you liked us, and we went to lunch and stuff?  All right.  I want to go to lunch and see all the food stuck in your braces and watching, picking  food out of your braces.  More caffeine for Tom, please.  It's happened.  It's happened.  Nothing like eating spinach.  Anyone else go home and go, the guy we're depending on wears braces? 
[00:52:00]  We should all be scared.  Bones his teeth straight.  How much more time?  A year?  He's not talking.  He's gone.  All right.  Our phone number.  What?  Ten months.  Ten months.  Will we still be here when Tom has his braces off?  Who knows?  All right.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  It's 1-866-313-FREE.  So, yeah, we're a little distracted.  We're in chaos.  Big news with this merger yesterday.  And now we got everybody talking and speculating on our demise. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Our possible demise, including John Minnelli, who's the program director here at Free FM  in New York City, sending us the fine email.  Well, yesterday that making sure we saw that Mel Karmazin, who's going to run the new company,  did not mention us in his email.  Although, we talked about everybody else.  Well, isn't the chairman higher than the CEO?  For now.  Chairman of the board.  Yeah, for now.  Chairman of the board.  So, then, I guess Bubba had to have fun with this as well. 
[00:53:00]  Who?  Bubba the Love Sponge.  Yeah, who exactly?  Bubba the Love Sponge, who used to trash Howard on a daily basis, but now that they're buddy-buddy,  makes believe he never trashed Howard.  Kiss his ass now.  Makes believe that he didn't want to be the next Howard Stern.  He had to lick you-know-whose butt to get a gig, so now he's got to do Howard's dirty work.  He sold his soul to the devil. 
[00:53:30]  You said lick, but then you know whose, and then you said butt.  I know, I know.  Yeah.  I don't know, whatever, they'll dump out of whatever they have to.  I didn't even realize that.  It was just funny, though.  Yeah.  Well, I was trying to clean up for radio, and I'm like, I've got to get rid of one of these words.  That wasn't it.  That wasn't the one.  You know what it was?  It was, I don't even want to do it, because I was going to give a great example, but, you  know, I don't want to do it, because I was going to give a great example, but, you  know, I'll just dump it.  Well, you know, you've got to play it safe over here, because you've got Al down the hall. 
[00:54:00]  Al.  Al.  Yeah, he, I guess, commented.  Just another hypocrite, so, you know, he's perfect for Howard's channel, the hypocrite  channel.  And he was commenting about whether or not we'll make the cut with the new company.  What about you, you dope?  Yeah, how about you?  What about you, fatso?  This isn't a serious taking over XM deal.  This is a 50-50 deal where, more than likely, half the people there will be fired, and half 
[00:54:30]  the people at XM will be fired.  It's just a lot of, like, management and redundant jobs and things like that.  But as far as talk shows go, who knows who they're keeping or letting go?  There's no guarantees.  I do know this.  I know that we're doing very well.  We're one of the most listened to channels on the platform, if not the most listened to.  Yeah, we're right up there on XM.  And we're the top billing channel on all of XM. 
[00:55:00]  So we make money.  Now, when it comes to Mel Karmazin, one thing we know, I don't care.  Do you think he likes everybody that he works with?  Do you think, Mel, when he smiles at everybody in the hallway, do you think he actually likes  everybody he works with?  I don't think he likes anybody.  Absolutely.  Because I don't think he...  He's a businessman.  And whether you love him or hate him.  If you opened up his chest, I think it's just a metal heart. 
[00:55:30]  He's all business.  He's a businessman.  And if there's one thing, whether you love this guy or hate him, he does no business.  He knows business.  And making money is what he wants to do.  So if he doesn't like somebody, but they're making him money, we went through that for five  years.  He did not like us for five years.  Yet we were making money.  So we stayed.  That's how it works.  Right. 
[00:56:00]  And as far as Bubba goes...  Let's call him Fatso.  As far as Fatso goes...  Fatso.  There's no buzz...  Hey, get a little Fatso there.  There's no buzz on Fatso's show.  There is absolutely...  How much does it suck that you get your stomach stapled and you're still considered a Fatso?  Fatso.  The one thing you want to get rid of, your fatness, you couldn't do it by getting your  stomach stapled.  There's no talk.  He gets no talk. 
[00:56:30]  No one's clamoring for an interview from him.  The only thing he does is talk about himself.  I guess in that small world that's surrounded by Howard and that whole circle, I guess he  feels like he's a big shot because he's with someone that was a big shot years ago.  But now, no one talks about this guy.  There is not one article or anything.  Us, they go out of their way not to mention us as far as this merger goes. 
[00:57:00]  And our name still makes it in.  And believe me, they go out of their way not to mention us.  And our name still makes it in.  And Bubba, not a peep about him as being one of these big shows that are involved in  this merger.  No one cares about this guy.  And this isn't me being opinionated.  I personally don't like the guy.  Yeah.  But I'm just spelling it out.  This is how it is.  No one cares about Bubba.  Fatso. 
[00:57:30]  I'm sure he's got his fans.  Oh, fatso.  I'm sure he has his fans that listen to his show.  But they're certainly not huge numbers.  That's for sure.  And no one, there's no word of mouth.  There's no water cooler talk.  There's nothing.  He's a nobody.  And he's trying to say whether we're going to make this cut.  And when push comes to shove and if this merger goes down, whether we're going to still have  jobs.  Look, if we're nervous, fatso should be really, really be nervous, really be nervous. 
[00:58:00]  And with all that said, this is the same guy that last year said that we were definitely  getting fired from XM when our contract was up in October.  This is last October.  And by that point, we had already signed a very long extension.  So his first prediction of our demise was gravely wrong.  But he said, you know, it's guaranteed.  Yeah, it was guaranteed. 
[00:58:30]  I know.  I got inside info, all this stuff.  And instead of firing us, they extended our contract.  So right there, he's a lying sack of crap.  So this one, too, he just he he should be the one that's a little worried.  Yeah.  Well, you know, fatso is doing great radio.  He's what he's he's shaving other guys down below.  Wasn't that his big bit to get people listening to his program?  I'd love to hit him on the whole gay radio thing. 
[00:59:00]  But after last week on this show, you can't even hit him on that one.  Jesus.  I guess you're right.  I guess you're right.  Jesus.  This show was so gay last week.  I don't know what happened.  He's a very genuine radio voice.  I like.  Yeah.  Well, that's the one thing I do like is the fact that his radio voice is a very natural,  very natural delivery.  I swear to you when you played a little bit of this before during break and I had never  and and Bujock say this all the time.  I will swear to you.  I have never heard this guy.  I had never until you played that clip. 
[00:59:30]  I had never heard this guy on the air like this.  And he sounds like man cow.  I thought you were playing a man cow clip.  Well, he's got that same delivery where you got to kind of talk fast because you're really  not saying anything and you're putting that radio voice on.  Oh, do you talk like that in real life?  Is that do you do you do you think your audience has this feeling of that?  You're delivering like honesty to them when you got it before you even say something you  got to put on this low radio voice. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, it's out of touch radio guys.  So what happened that type of delivery was very, very popular for many, many years.  The top 40 jocks started back in who knows, like the 50s and the 60s.  Yeah.  And then somewhere along the line, it's segmented to people actually going on the radio and just  talking with their regular voices.  You meet me in the street or Jimmy or Anthony, you're going to hear this exact voice.  Yeah, sorry.  If you meet Bubba in the street, you're going to hear something completely different than  this delivery that he's got. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, you'll hear him with a mouthful of food.  This is actually my radio voice.  In real life, I talk like that.  Yeah, that's what you got to do in real life.  You got to kind of talk fast and just babble about nothing.  Guys who have radio voices, they have radio voices because they have nothing to say.  Right, there's a reason for that.  So it's a distraction.  Yeah.  You hear all this blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You think you're hearing something important, but if you really, really listen closely,  you're like, wow.  Wow.  That guy has nothing to say.  Did he just say that Sammy Hagar sold more records? 
[01:01:00]  But he said it in a voice where I want to believe him.  So we give Fatso a huge audience today.  Hey, Fatso there.  You might as well send us a thank you card because we're giving you a massive audience  today.  This is what good old Bubba the Love Sponge, a.k.a. Fatso, had to say about us yesterday.  Now, obvious, the obvious question that everybody that's listening to my...  Listen to the obvious...  Obvious, obvious question. 
[01:01:30]  Obvious question.  What is that?  Obvious, obvious, obvious, obvious, obvious, obvious, obvious, obvious, obvious, obvious, obvious,  He's a fat-affected faggot.  Why do you talk like that?  What is that voice?  Let me just tell you something.  It's just creepy.  That delivery has been gone for at least a decade.  At least.  At least.  At least.  The last of the last of those guys was a decade ago.  Let me tell you something.  Roll around the dial right now. 
[01:02:00]  You're not going to hear a lot of guys talking like that.  No.  Because it doesn't get the job done anymore.  And the ones you do hear talking like that, you really want to listen to what they're saying.  You might hear a couple of them on like a top 40, like a morning zoo type of station.  All these stations have the guys that talk like this.  Oh, should I take a call from Baba Booey from Deer Park?  Please do it.  Boy, I wonder what he's going to say.  Baba Booey from Deer Park.  Yeah, of course you're going to hang up. 
[01:02:30]  I hung up.  You're a queer.  Oh, he couldn't even.  How does that feel?  You're a queer.  He couldn't even do it?  You got all nervous, didn't you?  Oh.  I was getting all nostalgic.  I wanted to hear that.  And then maybe you could have backed it up with the theme song to Family Ties.  And when I say queer, I don't mean to make fun of the faggot.  Wait a minute.  A queer is a whole different thing.  It's a whole different ball of that.  That's right.  Well, actually, gay people don't mind the queer moniker because that's used on TV shows. 
[01:03:00]  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.  And then they got like Queer Nation.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're.  Please, can we hear more of his voice?  Yeah.  Ah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  No.  Wah.  Wah.  How do you even talk?  I'm trying to talk like that.  Wah.  Come on, man.  You're good at like impressions.  You got to get really throaty. 
[01:03:30]  Throaty.  Really throaty.  Wah.  All the words have to bounce off the soft palate on the back of your throat and kind of fuck.  But then most of the words have to kind of come out your nose.  Your nose.  And give it that whole thing where you got to talk really fast and really say nothing and  go, ah, um, ah.  Jimmy, let me hear your voice.  Ah.  Ah.  That's good.  That's all I can do.  It's almost impossible to do.  Here we go.  Now, obvious to obvious question that everybody.  I can't even get past him for a second. 
[01:04:00]  Wah.  Did he do that at the doctor's office when they put the stick in his mouth?  Could you open and say, ah, wah.  No.  Well, he does that when something else is going in.  Oh, that feels fantastic, Bubba.  Wah.  Wah.  Now, the obvious question that everybody that's listening to my show and everybody that's listening  in the Howard show asks is, does Opie and Anthony make the cut?  Why do you have to talk about us there, Bubba?  Make the cut.  And I know people will call, well, why are you talking about him? 
[01:04:30]  We wouldn't even talk about him if this didn't come to our attention that he's going to be  the expert on what happens after a massive merger.  Yeah, and by the way, this must be us talking about them during our entire show.  That's, you know, that's what the hardcore kiss-ass fan will say.  Oh, that's all they do is talk about him.  We're just responding.  Right.  And then we'll move on, and Bubba will go back to, you know.  Obscurity.  Obscurity.  He gets a little spotlight today. 
[01:05:00]  You get a little bump.  No thank you necessary.  Fatso's feeling pretty good today, aren't you, Fatso?  No thanks necessary.  And remember, he challenged me to a fight.  He challenged me to a fight.  He goes anytime, anyplace.  So I actually named the place, and it got back to me that he couldn't do it on that day.  I got a babysitter.  Because he couldn't find a babysitter.  I have my kid with me.  I got a babysitter.  Go away, Fatso.  Keep feeding that fat face of yours after getting your stomach stapled. 
[01:05:30]  Boy, what kind of problems did you have growing up?  Ah.  Ah.  Usually the stapling takes care of the problem.  And I'm not even making fun of Fatso's out there.  Because there are people out there that are fat, and they love being fat.  But he didn't love being fat.  He had to get his stomach stapled, because he hated being a Fatso.  And guess what?  He's still a Fatso.  Why don't you talk about your stapling on the air, and why you had to get your stomach stapled.  What memory are you trying to hide from the past?  Ooh.  What was being fed into your mouth back then? 
[01:06:00]  What urges?  What urges that you have to cover up?  Ah.  Ah.  But he's going to be an expert on our careers.  I like to pause.  The question is...  Ah.  Ah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We can't get through three words.  All right.  We'll try.  We'll try.  Now, obvious question that everybody...  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  Ah.  Ah.  Obvious question that everybody...  Ah.  Obvious question.  Ah. 
[01:06:30]  More of Fatso's babbling after these messages.  Ah.  It's the Opie and Anthony.  Ah.  Show.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says...  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female enemies.  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:07:00]  Is anyone paying attention here in New York City?  Holy crap.  I just heard a Grammys commercial for the second time this morning.  Really?  I know.  In your city, you go local, so you probably didn't have the same commercial we just heard.  But they're promoting the Grammys.  Want to bet on the results?  Huh?  You want to bet on the results?  Yeah.  Bet, Tom.  Get your money back.  They're talking about a police reunion.  Man, the Grammys sound like they're going to be great this year.  It's going to be good.  Jesus.  My God.  I've got to thank Nassau County, one of Nassau County's finest, thank you this morning. 
[01:07:30]  I was in a bit of a rush.  I was a little late for work.  So I got pulled over a block from my house.  That's your excuse for speeding today?  Yeah.  And good thing, because here's what happens.  I come ripping down this road, and I got to make the light at the expressway.  If I don't make that light, I sit there for quite a while.  Or I'm supposed to sit there for quite a while.  I have been known to maybe skip through that light a couple of times. 
[01:08:00]  So I saw the don't walk sign blinking.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  So don't walk sign blinking.  So I knew I only had a limited time.  So I goosed it.  And right when I made the turn, I get hit with the lights.  And I'm like, oh, boy.  And the officer came out.  Of course, I do what I always do.  I turn the lights on, make sure my hands are up on the steering wheel, the window's down.  But he comes up and just kind of looks over and started laughing at me.  He goes, oh, because I was wondering who was doing 60 in a 30. 
[01:08:30]  Now, we do different things when we get pulled over.  When I get pulled over, I turn on Hot 97, and I make sure my hands are in both pockets.  Both pockets, and you just mouth off.  And I turn it up through a crack in the window only an inch big.  What did I get pulled over for?  Hopefully, I saw him with the N-word in it a lot.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, yeah.  Something anti-police.  That's what I do.  Rap music really loud, both hands in my pockets. 
[01:09:00]  Apparently, though, he...  Wait, a 60 in a 30, though, huh?  Yeah, 60 in a 30.  But then he was pretty cold, because I told him I was late.  And he goes, okay, go as fast as you want.  Did he really say that?  And then he goes, love Boardroom Jimmy.  Big fan of the show.  Yeah, big fan of the show.  And he was in the area, though, because the warmer weather.  He goes, well, the weather gets warmer.  He goes, we've been patrolling around your neighborhood,  because the weather gets warmer.  He goes, and the home invasions start again.  So now I got that to worry about.  Oh, boy.  Which is great.  You just got to get the gate. 
[01:09:30]  Well...  It's time for the gate.  No, I actually have my friend, Habil, Cowbell Bill.  He does alarms.  Come over yesterday.  And we're going to put a few more items in the house.  Like what?  You already have alarms.  Here it is, though.  What's wrong with you?  There's alarms that can detect the sound of breaking glass.  Here's what they're doing now.  Here's what the criminals do.  You can have an alarm system where if your window opens, the alarm goes off. 
[01:10:00]  The door opens, the alarm goes off.  Motion detecting, the alarm goes off.  Whatever.  But if they break your window and never move the frame, and there's not a sensor on the window or something like that,  because people don't like sensors on the windows.  That's like old school.  Or the aluminum little strip around the window.  It's like a prison.  So if they break your window, they can then come in your window, and especially nowadays, people have very large windows,  and load out through the window, never setting off the alarm.  No motion detectors, though?  Maybe the motion detector is bypassed. 
[01:10:30]  You don't have them all over your house.  There's certain ways of getting around those things.  So why don't you just hire someone to sit there with a gun?  Get a guard in the front.  Here's what they have now.  Someone walked the perimeter.  You're Italian, after all.  Here's what they have.  Get this.  It's a sensor that senses the sound of breaking glass.  Look at you.  How is that?  What if they cut it like they do in a lot of the escape movies?  Well, they're going to cut.  They put a suction cut, and they put a diamond around it, cut the glass, and pull it out.  Suction cup, man.  Suction cup doesn't work like that. 
[01:11:00]  Sure does.  Sure does.  No, it doesn't.  I used to rob banks.  Yeah.  Jimmy did.  Did you?  Uh-huh.  And I got these big muttons in the window, in the middle.  Could never do it without breaking the glass.  Anthony spends half his night laying in bed.  Motion detectors, cameras.  Staring at the ceiling, figuring out other ways to protect his house.  I want it like Scarface's house with the cameras where I can watch those gorillas come  over the wall.  What, are you afraid the Diaz brothers are going to come in?  The Diaz brothers.  We should be talking about that Scarface. 
[01:11:30]  It's an older movie.  No one cares about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, true.  By the way, I wonder if John Minnelli's going to critique the break we did with Tom Chiasano  and Van Halen, because that was just terrific.  That got people listening today.  Didn't it, John?  Do you have the balls to say how awful that break was?  Of course not.  Of course not.  He's out of control.  Oh, you.  I love it.  Because it doesn't make sense.  I know more about programming than he does.  He doesn't know the value of things.  And he knows programming.  But I'm challenging him now to his theories. 
[01:12:00]  The challenge is on.  Yeah, go ahead.  Critique the awfulness that was the Tom Chiasano break.  We learned a little something about Van Halen.  But at the end of the day, most people are going to be like, whatever.  Who cares?  All right, moving on.  Come on.  What about back to the voice?  Back to the voice.  Come on.  Don't lose focus.  All right.  Here we go.  Bubba the Love Sponge yesterday.  Good old fatso.  You can get through three words.  Scarved stomach and a fat belly wrapped around it.  He's the expert.  He's the expert on a huge merger. 
[01:12:30]  Him and his producer sidekick, dude.  Yeah, they're not talking to anybody about logistics of this merger.  The press releases that have come out, people have clamored for more information.  They're not saying who's going to stay, who's going, how they're actually doing hardware changes.  None of that.  No one knows anything.  But Bubba, fatso, excuse me, and his producer have all the inside poop. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, because they know.  Because Mel's going to talk to them.  Mel's talking to just them.  Oh, yeah.  Shut up, you self-important douche.  All right.  Here's the latest clip from fatso.  He knows nothing about the merger.  Not a thing.  By the way, I expect to thank you, Carr, tomorrow for giving you an actual audience today, fatso.  Now, the obvious question that everybody that's listening to my show and everybody that's listening to Howard's show asks is,  Pause. 
[01:13:30]  Does Opie and Anthony make the cut?  Make it dramatic.  Don't be so knee-jerk before you answer that question.  Try to take a little bit of thought.  My knee-jerk.  And the only reason that I think that they do not make the cut is that Howard hates them because they've just been total suckers.  They've never been.  I hope Al didn't dump out of that.  That was clean for this side of the program.  Beep suckers.  Well, the interesting thing is, you know, Bubba used to trash Howard on a daily basis. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, Bubba, do you remember Howard when you hated him and you used to trash him?  And, by the way, you were one of those people he lumped into the whole clone thing.  Yeah.  You don't remember that?  But you were hated.  But you got so desperate, this is what you have to do now.  It's pretty pathetic.  You decided to kneel down and just kiss ass, and that's what you did to get the job that you have right now.  We, on the other hand, yeah, Howard hates us. 
[01:14:30]  Mel hates us.  But they hated us when we were working for the same company, too.  And we lasted there for five years.  We did all right.  We'd have still been there, not because of their hatred.  We didn't get fired for that.  We got fired because we decided to have a couple go into a church and have a little sexual hanky-panky and put it over the airwaves.  Yeah, that was us, Jimmy.  That is what got us fired.  The fact of the matter was we were doing very well and making money for the company. 
[01:15:00]  And Mel likes money.  That's what this merge is about, you idiot.  It's not about, hey, let's merge so we can get rid of people we hate.  Hee, hee, hee.  What is it, a third-grade playground, you dummy?  You dunce?  Do you know how this business works?  It's all about cash, jackass.  How much money are you making for the company, Fatso?  How much are you billing?  You better do a little research on that.  Yeah, check that out.  You might want to check that out because that's going to be one of the deciding factors. 
[01:15:30]  Because you're not Howard.  You're not Howard.  You think you're part of that group because you're in there, because you're on the same channel, because you kiss his ass.  You're not.  You're not afforded the same liberties.  Howard and Mel have a loyalty to each other because they both built each other up and made each other very wealthy.  That's what happened.  You're not part of that.  Just because Mel smiles at you and Howard maybe gives you the time of day, don't mistake that for people liking you. 
[01:16:00]  It's all about money.  And you ain't making it.  There's no buzz.  No one's talking about Bubba.  I'm sorry.  It's just the truth.  Well, we are today.  But by tomorrow, you'll go back to obscurity.  This is your buzz.  Enjoy it.  Let's get back to fake radio voice guy. 
[01:16:30]  The reason that I think that they do not make the cut is that Howard hates them because they've just been total suckers.  They've never been.  They've been so disingenuous in dealing.  We've been the most genuine.  They've made a career at with Howard.  Wait, wait, wait.  Made a career.  Did you just use the word disingenuous?  Yeah, I know.  Well, because he's a dope.  Yeah, it's not disingenuous.  It's been vicious, but not disingenuous implies that they have not been consistent with their feelings about Howard.  This show has been very open about its feelings of disliking. 
[01:17:00]  No one has been disingenuous.  Yeah.  We know we're hated by him and that we hate him.  That's just the way it's been over the years.  I hate that we're in a business where the rest of the guys have low IQs.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, let's be honest here.  Why would.  It's got a low IQ.  And what does that mean?  Like, so so it's better what you did, which is bash him and do a complete about face and then your career. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, because you were fired and had nowhere else to go and you got hired over there.  You then had to kiss ass and what?  Now you think you're part of the in crowd over there?  Oh, are you sadly mistaken?  Oh, who are you sadly mistaken, fat boy?  Fatso.  Wow.  Fatso is a lot more fun to say.  Fatso is classic.  Fatso is great.  Timeless.  I like saying fatso and I like saying queer and I'm starting to like saying Neil Bortz, but I hate saying wall bounce. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, I thought you liked saying wall bounce.  No, I hate it.  What about King Cullen?  King Cullen is growing on me too.  Yeah.  So what else does fatso have to say?  I'm so disingenuous in dealing.  I mean, they have made a career at with Howard.  Yes.  A career.  They don't make it for that reason.  And the other reason is, from what I understand, is Mr. Carmerson does not like them.  Mr. Carmerson, you better call him Mr. Carmerson. 
[01:18:30]  And how does this dopey redneck producer know that?  Because we've said it in interviews.  Have you ever sat in Mel's office, you idiot?  Did you ever sit there in Mel's office and have him appraise you?  We have that.  And then 10 minutes later, he was railing us.  It's amazing.  Some dopey little producer knows, though.  Yeah, the producer knows.  Because he goes to Starbucks with Mel Carmerson.  Yeah.  Is that what you do?  That's the...  Donald Pleasance is his producer?  Who is that fat and bald Donald Pleasance? 
[01:19:00]  You are the Duke of New York.  You had your stomach stapled.  You're at number one.  And what drug is he on to hide childhood memories?  There's something going on in those eyes.  God, look at that lost look.  Yeah, the producer knows what Mel is saying and thinking.  Yeah, yeah.  You're really not saying anything everybody doesn't know.  You know where you got your info? 
[01:19:30]  Probably every interview we've done where people have asked us about our relationship with Howard and Mel.  Because we were very honest in saying that it's not good.  And so is that a surprise?  But does that keep people from working for other people if they can make them money?  Are you that naive?  Or you just think everybody's stupid?  We'll find out, won't we?  It's going to get interesting.  We'll talk to you.  Yeah, let's continue here.  From what I understand is Mr. Carmerson does not like them, which is... 
[01:20:00]  Oh, and they have a place to go.  So, you know, sayonara, mother...  Ooh!  Yeah, live it up, buddy.  I mean, yeah, you got New Year's.  Hell, I was in Tucson over the weekend and I had to see Opie and Anthony signs.  107.5, Opie and Anthony in the morning.  Thanks for the spot.  You've got to be kidding me.  All these Mexicans out here like these guys?  I wouldn't be surprised if they get fined soon.  See, that's what it comes down to, by the way, right there.  It's driving him nuts that he blew up his career and he wasn't able to move on. 
[01:20:30]  You know, that's what's really driving him nuts.  He had one choice when he got fired, and it was to go to satellite radio and kiss Howard's ass and move over there.  He was blackballed.  There you go.  Yeah, it upsets him.  We're doing both, Pally.  Everyone's talking.  We're doing both.  Everyone's talking.  Oh, Baba Booey's back.  Oh, cool.  He said it wouldn't surprise me if they got fined soon.  Let's take a trip back in time, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:21:00]  Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  Oh, this is so cool.  Wait a minute.  Let me soak this in.  I almost feel like...  Go ahead.  A little more.  Baba Booey.  Baba Booey.  Wow.  Hey, did you hear that new Pearl Jam album?  That band is great.  They're called Pearl Jam, and they're amazing.  Hey, guess what?  I'm going to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Smashing Pumpkins tomorrow at Roseland.  It's going to be a fantastic concert. 
[01:21:30]  Yes, sir.  Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  Howard Stern's penis.  Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  Baba Booey.  Baba Booey.  All right.  He's one of ours.  And then he gives us a Frankus.  My goodness, man.  I don't know if I love them or hate them.  I wanted to keep with the whole thing of the time machine.  Yeah, we were going into our time machine.  I was going into a time warp.  You wrecked our time machine.  That's great.  That Baba Booey is like a DeLorean.  That call was, ah, very disingenuous.  Ah, I'm disingenuous.  You're disingenuous. 
[01:22:00]  Ah, he talks like that.  It's all those orders.  What would you like?  Ah, cake.  Ah, yeah.  That's when you use that.  People have been saying, open athlete.  Do they make the cut?  Do they make the cut?  Like the incision on your belly before the swing line went in?  Chick, chick.  Chick, chick.  All right.  American Idol last night.  Who cares about American Idol?  Who cares? 
[01:22:30]  John Minnelli.  Yeah, I know.  Does he?  What's his view on this?  Should we do it?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I can't decide.  Oh, my God.  I'm so confused.  We just got to follow our hearts.  That's what we got to do.  Where's boardroom Jimmy, by the way?  Well, boardroom, I didn't want to interrupt before because they were talking about Bubba,  but I was just clear he didn't understand the merger.  Well, a lot of people don't understand the merger because it's a very complicated thing.  These are two big companies, a lot of money, a lot of debt. 
[01:23:00]  They're going to join up, and who knows what's going to happen after that.  Well, what are the stock prices that we're supposed to review today?  Well, up a bit.  I believe XM went up a few points, a few dollars, a couple of dollars, and Sirius went up.  Well, how about some specifics?  A couple of dollars is not what I was asking you.  Uh-oh.  I'm not sure of the exact numbers.  I believe it's something like 6%.  Check the Dow Jones.  Wait until it gets to $42, and then purchase. 
[01:23:30]  That doesn't make sense.  Of course it does, Gregory.  Purchase, and then sell low.  Wait a minute.  Wait, that goes against everything I've ever heard.  So purchase high, sell low?  That's always the way you do it, according to NASDAQ.  And Mel Carmozzi and I spoke about this at great length.  Mel Carmozzi.  Well, boardroom Jimmy is an expert on mergers and the stock market and portfolios.  If you don't understand capital gains distribution, I suggest you purchase some stock and then look at the NASDAQ, my friend. 
[01:24:00]  You sound stupid.  Very into the NASDAQ.  Of course I am.  The Dow Jones is for faggots.  You don't like the Dow Jones?  I'll tag you without a pillow between your teeth.  Boardroom Jimmy, this is not a popular opinion here.  Who are we to say?  People have their pens and paper out right now, and they're taking notes because they're going to make a killing today just listening to boardroom Jimmy. 
[01:24:30]  We've got to tell our listeners, this is a privilege that you get to listen to boardroom Jimmy.  He's an expert.  Forget about that Jim Cramer guy, that money guy.  He knows nothing.  Jim Cramer has the his.  He got it from sitting on the Dow Jones.  You can sit on the whole Dow Jones?  You certainly can.  Just look at the stock index.  Stop asking me questions, Gregory.  This sounds a lot like Frank the Frowder, I've known.  A little bit, but a little more energy.  A little more energy, yeah.  Now, the market doesn't open for a little while. 
[01:25:00]  I know that.  I'm a part of the market.  I have a seat on the exchange.  It's next to a guy named Ted.  Do you like Ted?  Do you like sitting next to Ted?  He's a pedophile.  Now, what do the indicators say, like the futures?  Are they up or down?  What's going to happen with the market based on what the futures are?  Fructose.  Buy fructose.  Fructose.  Wow, you heard.  I've got to write it down.  Oh, my God.  I'm writing fructose.  Everybody, fructose is your buy. 
[01:25:30]  That's your pick today.  I was thinking pork bellies, but.  Pork bellies are no good.  Oil and gold are going into the toilet because fructose is now popular.  Fructose.  Fructose.  All right.  Fructose.  You had a better return on your equity.  Better return on your equity.  It's just like listening to the money, honey.  We got some calls coming in.  Yeah, yeah.  Hi, Boardroom Jimmy.  I was listening to the news this morning.  I guess earnings came out for the Home Depot, and they were down. 
[01:26:00]  Is this an indicator on the future of maybe building and the housing market?  Depreciable cost.  That's all this is about.  Depreciable cost.  What about JetBlue?  Depreciable cost.  Thank you.  What about JetBlue?  Is that a good buy today?  You know, they've had troubles in the last week or so, and the stock dropped a bit in the last few days, Jimmy.  This is the worst time to buy.  You should wait another six weeks, wait until the stock is really low, and then buy before they go belly up. 
[01:26:30]  Because they're going to continue plummeting.  So buy low and sell lower.  Well, that goes...  TWA is the airline to go with.  TWA.  TWA.  But that goes against everything.  It certainly doesn't.  What about calls and putzes?  Total assets less current liabilities, my friend.  That's what a put should equal.  I don't know if that's what the definition is of a put. 
[01:27:00]  It is what a put should be.  Yeah?  Yes.  All right.  Well, fantastic.  Boardroom, Jimmy.  Another call coming in.  Boardroom, Jimmy.  The automotive industry obviously having a tough year.  Ford at its lowest in quite a while, just recently.  What about the idea that Chrysler is going to be put up for sale and one of these other companies, General Motors or Ford, might actually buy Chrysler?  Or maybe a Chinese car maker.  Or Toyota, I believe, was in the running. 
[01:27:30]  What do you think about this?  I would say composite depreciation and purchased bicycles.  Cars are old hats.  Boardroom, Jimmy.  So are you saying buy Schwinn?  Schwinn bicycles?  Standard and Porsche 500.  That's all that matters.  And commodities are for queers.  Well.  What about fructose?  Fructose is the way to go. 
[01:28:00]  Unless you have a plunger in your toilet that you refuse to remove, then buy commodities and take a seat.  Well, how do you buy fructose?  Exactly.  Is it part of the Dow, the NASDAQ?  It's about both, but without the Dow Jones involvement.  Double declining balanced depreciation, Gregory.  Calls you Gregory to keep it a threshold.  Of course I do, Mr. Camilla.  Line of business reporting is what this is about.  Line of business.  Pay-for-profit, gentlemen.  Are we at a bull market there, Boardroom Jimmy?  We possibly could be.  Bulls or bears? 
[01:28:30]  Bulls or bears.  What do you got?  Who's running Wall Street?  It all depends on who you talk to.  Bulls all think they're running it, and the bears all think they're running it.  I think it's Dow and Jones.  That's what I think.  All right, well.  Oh, wow.  We got the bull bears.  We certainly do weighted alpha.  That's the key.  Oh.  And synergy, anything on synergy today, sir?  Synergy is for men with braces and yellow ties. 
[01:29:00]  I don't like synergy.  Well, Boardroom Jimmy, people are just going nuts.  They can't write fast enough.  They want to make some money today.  Um, uh, Boardroom Jimmy, I've been looking a lot into, um, the tech sector.  I know it's a little more risky than the blue chips, but, um, uh, they seem to be doing  well, and I'm thinking, is this a good time to jump into techs, at least for the short  term?  I would say no.  Go with Deutschmarks.  Deutschmarks are the way to go.  Deutschmarks.  Oh, all right. 
[01:29:30]  Deutschmarks.  If you're not buying precious metals, they're going to be left in the dust.  What about doublooms?  I love what doublooms are.  They're just a rumor.  The rumor of doublooms.  Diplomes don't exist.  They were made up ones.  Do you agree with the, um, saying, um, uh, buy on rumor, sell on news?  That was not a rumor.  That was something I said one time in a blackout.  I didn't mean it.  I was drunk driving.  Wow. 
[01:30:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Boardroom Jim is giving out some of the best stock information I've ever heard.  Yeah, uh, Boardroom Jimmy, my, my portfolio is a bit, it's a bit weak.  Unbalanced?  It's unbalanced.  I need something.  I need a, I need a good stock tip here.  What about a hedge fund?  Yeah.  What about hedge funds there?  Maybe, uh, hedge your, hedge your, uh, portfolio.  Yeah.  I would suggest a hedge fund, but don't put any money into it.  Put maybe $40 into a hedge fund.  And then sit back and reap the benefits, my friend.  $40.  He'll put $40 into a hedge fund, then you can kick back your feet and have a pina colada 
[01:30:30]  on easy street.  Boardroom Jimmy, penny stocks.  A lot of people love trading these things.  Yes, they're called Jews, Gregory.  Effective annualized seven-day yield.  That's what this is all about.  Oh, effective.  Wow.  I'm, I'm still, I'm still, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the hedge fund.  Of course you'll have $40. 
[01:31:00]  Uh, precious metals, uh, blueberries, what do you got today?  Oh, precious metals are out.  Nobody is touching them anymore.  It's all fructose and, and NASDAQ.  Everybody wants a NASDAQ and some fructose.  Uh, uh, boardroom Jimmy, I got a question about, uh, oil.  Um, uh, I'm, I'm thinking about getting into oil, home heating oil.  Uh, is this going to be going up or down?  Do you see this in the near future?  Oil is a rumor.  It's going away because magnets are now being used.  Management's discussion and analysis. 
[01:31:30]  We had this at the meeting last week.  So you're saying I should, uh, invest in magnets.  Yes, and also phony radio voices, which is going to be on the Bubba 500.  Are you going to, uh, what do you think of this merger?  Is it going to go through?  I think that the merger will go through.  But then the FCC will say it shouldn't have went through.  And then they'll both go back to being NASDAQ, but not without fructose inclusion.  Inclusion?  Market surveillance, gentlemen. 
[01:32:00]  Markets?  What the hell is market surveillance?  Exactly.  Who is this girl with a beard?  Oh, sorry, Travis.  It's all about e-business and dot-coms.  How many times do I have to tell you that?  What about dot-coms?  Dot-coms are no good.  Mutual funds.  Wait until XM hits $39 and then buy.  Buy at $39?  At $39?  Sell at $42.  All right, well, you would make a profit at least.  But it will never hit that high world, Gregory. 
[01:32:30]  I don't know.  You're going to max out at $17.  Boardroom Jim, I'm thinking about actually taking my money out of the market, and I'm looking  more into municipal bonds, tax-free municipal bonds.  Well, what do you think?  It's a pretty low risk.  I'm thinking about doing this to fund my child's college.  I refer you to the Lipper Fund Indexes.  All of your answers can be found there.  That's the list.  Oh, my God, it's a bull market, huh? 
[01:33:00]  The barrels are running.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is $341.  $341.  What year is it?  Exactly.  Hey, Boardroom Jimmy, the upcoming elections, you know, we got a Democratic, what, Congress  there and stuff.  Will this affect the stock market in the long run?  It never, they never, nobody ever cares who's in office.  It doesn't matter.  The economy is overrated.  Where you're buying precious metals, and you're investing in commodities. 
[01:33:30]  For instance, gasoline.  I buy it.  You would buy gasoline.  I certainly do.  How much should I buy?  I would say put at least $200 to $300 into the gasoline market, and then sit back and  relax on Easy Street.  Oh, I thought you were talking about your...  It's going to work for you.  Oh, hey, Boardroom Jimmy!  Wow, Boardroom Jimmy, you've given me so many good answers today.  Of course I have. 
[01:34:00]  I'm looking for a way to fund my retirement.  What do you think about an IRA?  Oh, I don't like them.  They support violence.  I don't go for the IRA.  I would say 10-year keynote yield.  Keynote yield is everything.  Keynote yield.  Those and long yellow ties in the homosexual community.  What about war bonds?  What about the black market, Jimmy?  There's so many things to discuss today.  I don't believe in breaking things down racially, Gregory. 
[01:34:30]  That's what divides us as a country.  Blacks should be allowed to buy stock, although a lot of it.  Why not a lot of it?  Because they're not as responsible as white people.  What is that noise?  Oh, hello.  Those are the bulls and the bears.  Yes, a modest gain is always popular.  A modest gain.  Soybean futures.  I mean, the questions are coming in like crazy here.  Well, why don't we take a call, and I'll be happy to answer any questions.  All right.  Let's see. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, yeah, here's a great question from Ford in Wyoming.  Ford, what's up?  You're on with Boardroom Jimmy.  Hey, how you doing, my name?  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, what do you think about the latex market?  Latex?  Yeah, the latex market.  The latex market is going to crash simply because other things are taking over.  I refer you to the NASDAQ composite.  Answer your own questions, please.  This is child's play.  Louie in Jersey.  Louie.  Louie.  Hey, Louie. 
[01:35:30]  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I would like to ask Boardroom Jimmy if you could tell me what I could do with my porch bellies.  Porch bellies.  Convertible bond and domestic hybrid funds.  How many times do I have to say this?  Boardroom Jimmy, we're seeing a lot of action in China.  What do you think about investing in China?  Can this actually pay off in the future?  I would suggest investing in black retard wigs in China. 
[01:36:00]  They seem to be very popular on that group.  Whoa, hey.  Wow, it's getting a...  The bulls are actually chiming in on that one.  They like it.  The bulls are running today.  Just don't invest in body hair because they don't have any of it.  They're all so smooth, aren't they?  Yeah, they are.  Jeff, what do you got?  Yes, good morning, Boardroom Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I've heard your niceties.  Get to the point so the Dow Jones is plummeting.  It's not plummeting.  The market isn't open yet.  That's the problem, Anthony. 
[01:36:30]  How do you not understand this?  Boardroom Jimmy, I believe we hit an all-time high with the Dow yesterday.  We didn't.  That was the NASDAQ S&P 500 composite.  Sir, please, your question.  All right, Jeff, what do you got?  We know where you stand on fructose, but we're wondering what your position is on the frunkus.  Yeah, the frunkus stock, Boardroom Jimmy.  I would say that stock indexes indicate that frunkus has gone by the wayside, and I'm running out of steam on this one, too, sir.  No, he's saying no on the frunkus. 
[01:37:00]  Okay.  All right, well.  Well, a lot of great information today.  Thank you so much, Boardroom Jimmy.  It's just amazing, the financial information.  I don't know how everybody that listens to him isn't a millionaire.  Yeah.  You just take his advice.  There's going to be a lot of brand-new millionaires today when the market opens up at 9.30.  Is that when it opens?  Remember.  Well, Boardroom Jimmy, you should know when the market opens.  Well, I don't believe in going to the market.  I just talk behind the scenes and then buy stock before announcements are made. 
[01:37:30]  Remember, fructose, invest in fructose, put $40 in a hedge fund, and buy $300 in gasoline and sit back and watch the money rolling.  You put $40 in a hedge fund, you put a Chez Lounge out, you kick your feet up, and you enjoy Easy Street.  With a nice big stogie right there.  With a big stogie.  Or some braces.  Boardroom Jimmy, before we go to break here, you've got to remind the people how serious inside trading is. 
[01:38:00]  What's your feeling on the inside trading?  Well, it was like when Mr. Parsons and Mr. Carmazzi and I were talking, and they said, hey, hey, Jimmy, a big deal's going down.  Buy stock now.  I said, that should be legal.  The government frowns on inside trading there.  Oh, they don't frown on it, Jimmy.  It's just a little winking and odd.  We all understand what a bear market will do to a boy.  Well, all right.  There you go.  God, I can't wait until the market opens so I could just invest in fructose and $40 in my hedge fund. 
[01:38:30]  And what was the other?  I don't know.  Something about the NASDAQ deposit I have to do.  And Dow Jones is for homos.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Boardroom Jimmy.  Thank you.  All right.  The info.  Invest in pointy hats in China.  Right.  With grenades in them.  All right.  Well, there's so many questions.  And maybe we'll have Boardroom Jimmy on the show tomorrow.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Yeah.  Very volatile guy. 
[01:39:00]  Well, yeah.  The market, is it volatile?  Boardroom Jimmy?  Huh?  Is the market volatile?  I wouldn't say it's volatile, but I would say that it's kind of up and down.  Well.  It's very disingenuous.  Why not just throw that one in there, you fat staple stomach idiot?  I would say invest in stomach staples for fat Florida DJs.  All right.  All right.  Well, you gave us a lot to digest there, Boardroom Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's just let that soak in, and we got a good hour and a half. 
[01:39:30]  The market will open, and I see new millionaires being made just by taking this advice.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05.  That's 866-WOWME05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.

[01:40:30]  Hi.  Jimmy, going to Dallas, right?  Addison?  Oh, yeah.  Addison Improv.  Tomorrow, Thursday through Sunday.  I'm actually doing the extra night as I am preparing.  So if you're in Dallas or around there, come to Addison Improv tomorrow through Sunday.  Are you hanging with Pugs and Kelly?  Yeah.  I think I'm doing their show on Friday, right?  They tried to get me to do morning radio there.  I'm like, we're on morning radio there.  I'm not going to do morning radio.  I'm getting stationed.  We split the morning show down there.  Oh, doing?  In Dallas, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  You don't want to compete with us?  Oh, I didn't know we split the morning show.  We'll kick your ass.  No, after we're off the air, they continue with the morning show, and that's what they  want you to do, I guess.  No.  Yeah, but then you would be competing against us, technically.  No, no, no.  Not on...  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, not on...  No, on another station.  Oh, oh, oh.  I'm like, oh, no, no, no.  Well, that's a little weird.  I don't do that.  Unless they have a lot of listeners.  No.  All right, other things going on.  American Idol was Who Cares TV yesterday.  Anyway, the guys sang last night, and they just sucked. 
[01:41:30]  It was so lackluster.  This season, I could give a crap about it.  And I was a big fan over the past few seasons.  You know, I knew what was going on.  And now I just, like, I hadn't even been tuning in.  Last night, I figured, ah, let me take a look.  I looked, these guys are just coming up, and just, ugh, lackluster.  Could care less.  But there was a moment, and, uh...  I missed it, because I turned it off.  That's how bored I was with it. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, I was playing Luminous.  I just...  Of course you were.  I just picked up my PSP, started playing.  I like OCD games when I'm doing a lot of thinking.  You're Luminous.  It makes me think less, which is a good thing.  So I was watching American Idol, and I was bored, so I picked up the old PSP and just  started, uh, trying to make blocks.  That's my job.  I just gotta make blocks over and over again.  More blocks need to be made.  Hey, are we doing a MacBook karaoke thing at all?  Any type of singing thing?  I think it's, uh...  Yeah, the contest is coming soon, so the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:42:30]  Because I know a girl who was trying out for American Idol, like, last year.  I think I told you about her, and she didn't get past the first round, which was...  And I saw her sing karaoke for the first time.  Jesus, could she belt out a tune?  I'm like, how did she not...  How did some people get through and other people not get through?  Yeah.  I think they pretty much just handpick a few people, uh, to let in.  And then the rest of them.  Because they can't go through a stadium full of people.  So they must just go, all right, these people, you're in.  Everyone else, get out.  Yeah.  Our staff rocks, by the way. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, what'd they do?  Uh, one of the staff members.  No one's raising their hand.  Uh-huh.  No one's brave enough to raise their hand, but this was just handed to me by a masked  man that works for the Opie and Anthony show.  A masked man?  I said...  Oh.  Did I say a masked man, man?  Yes.  Well, yeah.  Uh, because we love just turning the screws on this show.  From John Minnelli's email a few weeks ago.  Oh.  Why you won't be hearing much about American Idol on Free FM after the initial audition 
[01:43:30]  rounds.  Even though ratings stay strong and even build closer to the finals, young guys, and also  me, begin to bolt after the wild card auditions in the various cities.  Says Fox's Preston Beckman in the Daily News, younger men like to show up to watch the auditions  because it's a freak show.  There's a lot of comedy.  You laugh.  Does that describe Free FM or what?  But we won't be discussing the good singers here, you can be sure, unless one of them 
[01:44:00]  whips out a knife and stabs Simon.  Oh, wait, I got a new one for that.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Wait, it's...  Unfortunately, the timing's going to be a little bad, but I got a perfect...  A perfect...  Oh, a new one.  Oh.  Yeah, let me do the last line again and then play our brand new clip.  Uh-huh.  Debuting a brand new clip.  Maybe not.  Okay, here we go. 
[01:44:30]  You laugh.  Does that describe Free FM or what?  We won't be discussing the good singers here, you can be sure, unless one of them whips out  a knife and stabs Simon.  Halfway, three, no!  Good!  No!  No!  Oh, my, I'd tell you something.  How does that not go in?  Ah, yeah.  The old...  Hey, it made...  Oh, no, it did.  Do you got the other one?  I love the other one, too.  Anyway.  Yeah, I love that one. 
[01:45:00]  That's our new one.  Get that on my machine.  Fans, eagerly...  Here we go.  Yeah.  Okay.  Here it is.  Back goes Griffey, looking up, and it's out of here!  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  Is that the same announcer?  I can't get this out of the machine, by the way.  Sounds like him.  There's a ghost in the machine.  Oh, you had a reboot.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Now it's just uncomfortable for us.  Not the reboot.  It's uncomfortable for the listeners.  Oh, everyone's turning red.  Because we just sit here and... 
[01:45:30]  And wait.  Awkwardly.  We can't improv.  Just be awkward.  Oh, boy.  Now what do we do?  Anyway, uh...  Simon and Ryan went at it yesterday.  And, man, just when it's gonna get good, they both back off.  See, I love Simon.  Yeah.  No surprise there, I guess.  But I love Simon Cowell, and I think Ryan Seacrest is just a pussy.  A little too fruity for me.  A boring fruit.  A little too fruity.  He's just a wimp. 
[01:46:00]  He really, really is.  Passive-aggressive.  Jimmy likes to use that term a lot.  He's very passive-aggressive.  So, uh...  So, there was some tension in the air last night, and Ryan interrupts.  Simon's judging.  He was doing a fine job just trashing one of these kids, because the kid deserved it.  You're on a national show being watched by over 30 million people.  You deserve to be trashed.  It's a privilege.  It's a privilege to be on American Idol.  Yeah.  Star maker.  That show.  Uh...  So, Ryan interrupts.  Simon's judging. 
[01:46:30]  Simon doesn't like it.  And, well, he calls Ryan a name.  Oh, okay.  I've got to know you.  I like you very much.  Um...  And I think you're a fantastic personality.  Having said that, I kind of felt I was at some weird student gig, because...  I don't even know what that means.  What's a student gig?  You know, it's just a lot of students, and someone gets up and sings a song.  You know...  I'm sorry.  I really am struggling tonight.  Why do they sing? 
[01:47:00]  Why do they sing?  The student.  Who's asking you?  I'm asking you?  I don't know.  You do the links, sweetheart.  No, but you're not making sense.  Ryan's doing that.  Isn't Simon great?  You do the links, sweetheart.  What's the links?  I guess the in-betweens, yeah.  The segues?  He just does the little segues, and the we'll be back, and the...  You do the links, sweetheart.  That's great.  Oh, that's great.  Isn't that great?  He doesn't respect Ryan.  He knows that anyone could be doing Ryan's job.  That's the easiest job on American Idol.  I hated Simon a long time ago, but he really has grown on it. 
[01:47:30]  He really is great.  I mean, that's a very genuine dislike of that guy.  Oh, yeah.  So it gets a little ugly after he calls him sweetheart.  I backed it up a bit.  Student.  Who's asking you?  I'm asking you?  I don't know.  You do the links, sweetheart.  You're not making sense.  Ryan Seacrest, ladies and gentlemen.  Ryan Seacrest.  Don't call me sweetheart.  I'm finished.  Ryan Seacrest, ladies and gentlemen, please.  Don't call me sweetheart.  Sweetheart.  We don't have that kind of relationship.  I don't want that kind of relationship.  I don't want that kind of relationship.  Exactly.  We'll just work together. 
[01:48:00]  That's fine with me.  Bye.  I think it's even working for the struggle.  Thank you.  Chris, sorry about this right now.  It's about Chris Sly, not you.  Yeah, that's the point I was trying to make.  Wow.  Yeah, and the music.  Cue the music.  Cue the music.  Cue the music.  Play it really loud.  We don't want a real moment here.  Perish the thought the judges are real human beings.  Perish the thought they have a real moment.  They should have let them just slug it out.  Everybody would have been talking about it today.  Seacrest, they all laughed at him.  Yeah.  Yep.  Because they know.  Thanks.  Don't call me sweetheart. 
[01:48:30]  Sweetheart.  Sweetie.  Well, he's in uber protection mode because there's rumors.  There's been rumors for many years.  So if you're going to be called that word, it might get to you.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  I have no effing idea.  But it's been written about, some rumors.  It got real uncomfortable, and Randy jumped in, like, trying to diffuse it, and the music  got turned up real loud.  Yeah.  Well, they continue.  Really?  What I have to say is that just because I don't sing Il Devo or Teletubbies doesn't 
[01:49:00]  mean that...  Oh, yeah.  By the way, okay, just to set this up, it's the fat kid that looks like Jack Osborne, who's  really funny.  He's got a great sense of humor.  So now, I guess Ryan's like, well, are you going to take that abuse from Simon?  What do you have to say about that?  And that's where the clip picks up.  Chris comes back with an insult at Simon.  Simon lets Ryan know he's made it uncomfortable for everybody.  So remember, it's a chubbier kid going after Simon now.  What I have to say is that just because I don't sing Il Devo or Teletubbies doesn't  mean that I'm not a good singer. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, Chris, yeah!  Chris, you can always do the latter.  You can always do the latter.  You're chubby enough to sing a Teletubbies song.  Teletubbies.  I was bashing Simon, because I guess he was a producer of Teletubbies.  Ew, was he?  A Teletubbies record?  Yeah, something like that.  Made a bloody fortune.  Yeah, Chris, yeah! 
[01:50:00]  Chris, you could always do the latter.  Simon, you're terrible.  Chris, you're funny.  And I love you.  You know that.  Chris, I like you.  I just don't think it was an incredible vocal performance.  That's the point I was trying to make.  I think you've heard his feelings.  Is there you have?  I'm sorry.  I think so.  Well, you've made this very uncomfortable, Ryan, now.  Yeah, Ryan.  Because for once, instead of you insulting somebody else, you were insulting.  No, no, no.  You just made it uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I think you two need to talk after class. 
[01:50:30]  Therapy, too.  I think we can move on with this show and handle this at another time.  This is what frustrates the hell out of me.  There was a moment.  There was an opportunity for a real moment there, and they just diffused the whole thing.  They should have just went at it.  That's what it is about.  It's a reality show, technically.  Yeah, but it's not about them, is what it is.  They would probably get screwed by the producers if they really went at it.  It's live.  You know, that's the thing that makes it kind of exciting, is that the show is live. 
[01:51:00]  Is it live?  Yeah.  You don't know what's going to happen.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, live show.  So when things like this happen, you see it.  They'd cut all that crap out if it was on tape.  Oh, my God.  Well, I think that they want some of counterbalance, because there's been so much flack for American  Idol being too mean this year, because of fat hens like Linda Stacey and her awful friend  sitting down for an evening of Coco and American Idol, and it was too mean, so I think they're  trying to balance it out by being mean to Simon.  Mean to Simon, mean to each other.  It's not a junior high school play. 
[01:51:30]  They're on a massive show.  They should be even meaner.  Yeah, this is a show that, I mean.  I'm serious.  Launches careers.  Launches gold record artists and Oscar nominees, Oscar winners.  For some reason, they forgot that it's a privilege to be on this show in front of America.  Yeah.  You think they should be meaner?  Absolutely.  Your problem is you're a jigaboo.  Just get down and dirty, racist, ugly.  If I was the producer, I'd have a trap door. 
[01:52:00]  So long, stupid.  And that's it.  You're obviously mentally retarded.  Let's go to Mike in Woodbridge.  Mike.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  If you go, you guys have all the clips.  If you go to the very end of the show, Ryan says, and I want to thank our judges, Randy  and Paul.  He does not even mention Simon.  Oh, no.  The controversy's building.  Oh, there's controversy now.  Well, I would play that clip, but I just heard John screaming at his radio saying, no! 
[01:52:30]  What kind of an idiot would not mention one of the bigger names in a communication?  All right, Jimmy.  We're in chaos here.  We're in crisis mode.  Bear with us.  Neither side wanted to mention us yesterday.  Maybe we should change our ways.  We should be good boys.  Maybe that would be smart.  All right.  Hey, we're trying to get together a crazy chick day. 
[01:53:00]  I don't know if this has legs, but we want to do a Britney Spears crazy chick day.  We know you're out there.  Remember Jackie the knife girl from back in the day?  How could we forget?  Is she still letting guys rub knives all over her body?  She liked to lay down and have guys drag knife blades over her body.  Not like cut through or like a stake, but just take the sharp end, hold on to the handle, 
[01:53:30]  and very lightly drag the serrated blade up and down her body, and she would completely  go wild.  Hey, Iraq.  Knife girl.  For tomorrow, I want you to get a really good clip of Jackie the knife girl.  Oh, the video's up on opiananthony.com.  How did they find that?  All right.  You'll load it on the front page.  It'll be on the search engine.  It'll be on the front page of opiananthony.com, but knife fetish girl, I'm looking at part  four.  She's like moaning like crazy, and this guy has really, really, really sharp knives. 
[01:54:00]  They were like those professional knives you got to go to a special store to get.  Yeah.  And by the time she left, she had like what looked like cat scratches.  They're like little scratches.  They leave marks on her.  Yeah, that's for sure.  That's how sharp the knives were.  Yeah, and he's dragging them over every part of her body.  Every part of her body.  And she was losing her mind.  Can you get a clip for tomorrow's show?  Because we really want to see if we can get crazy chick day going on the opiananthony show. 
[01:54:30]  We're looking for girls to do like Jackie the Knife Girl is doing in this video I'm watching.  I know it's radio, but oh my god.  She's so into that.  She's laying there.  That is wild.  Little panties.  Yeah, she's laying there in her panties and black panties and bra, and this guy is just  dragging the knife all up and down from like her neck down to her knees, like everywhere  in between.  Can I make a suggestion?  I know No Filter Paul is out there.  He really helps us.  We love when our videos go viral. 
[01:55:00]  We can't get enough of it when one of the videos goes viral.  This thing could go viral now that I'm looking at it.  It's pretty wild looking.  Can we get that up on, I think, break.com would throw that on their front page if we  got a nice section of that.  I know it's in like 20,000 parts, but maybe we could get one of the parts that is really  good and get it up on break.  Maybe No Filter Paul could help us out or somebody else.  Let's get it up on YouTube and GorillaMask.net. 
[01:55:30]  I really believe that could go viral.  Let's try to get this thing to go viral.  Anyway, Crazy Chick Day.  So if you want to do something pretty crazy for Crazy Chick Day, we want to hear from you.  I mean, the obvious, we would love to get a few girls to just shave their head and join  Team Brittany.  Maybe there's a few other things.  Crazy Chick.  Well, we need suggestions from the listeners, too.  What other things could girls do for Crazy Chick Day?  Shave head, knives.  What else do Crazy Chicks do? 
[01:56:00]  I would love to see a girl slice her wrist live on the show.  Yeah, that might be a problem.  Hilarious.  That could be a problem.  But you're not really trying to kill yourself if you do it that way.  You just need a little attention.  That's all it is.  Just a little attention.  Jimmy knows.  Just a hug.  Jimmy knows.  Just a pat on the head to go, we notice you.  Crazy Chick, though, thing would have to be, something just, for some reason, it comes  out as sexual.  Yeah?  It would have to be, like, sexual.  Yeah.  Because what else could they do?  You know, scream, run in a circle, and jump out the window? 
[01:56:30]  I mean, there's only so much Crazy Chicks can do.  Maybe they could make a phone call, a funny phone call, like, you got Prince Albert in  a can, and then just see where it goes.  Yeah.  I mean, I like the idea.  All right, well, let it sit there.  Some of these ideas we come up with, they'd go nowhere, and others just grow into a fine  flower.  Ah, they blossom.  They blossom.  I think we get some girls to at least shave their head, but maybe that would be kind of  boring.  I don't know.  Oh, by the way, we worked this stuff out live on the show. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  I know you're sitting there going, wow, I'm listening to a radio show meeting.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  Uh, let's say hi to Toe Sucker from Queens.  Toe Sucker.  What up, man?  I got this rhyme about Britney Spears, man.  You want to hear it?  Uh, check it out.  You sound like a white guy.  I know this blonde head.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, man.  We want to get to know the caller a little bit.  Are you a white guy trying to sound black?  No, no, no.  I'm a brother.  Okay.  I'm a brother, man.  You're a rapper?  So I'm a Toe Sucker for hire if you so desire. 
[01:57:30]  So I open my mouth wide while the girls put their toes inside.  Is this part of the rhyme?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're just talking.  I don't even know.  Right, right.  So y'all need to suck some toes when you have this contest, dog.  You know what I'm saying?  You dig on that, huh?  Right.  Oh, shit.  Man, we might be onto something because the phones are lit.  All right.  They're lit with ideas for Crazy Chick Day.  We got a couple girls calling in.  Yo, you know what you do?  You get a bottle of tequila, you pour it on the big toe.  You get a bottle of Tabasco, you pour it on the little toe.  You have yourself a toe-sucking good time. 
[01:58:00]  You know what I'm saying?  All right, we get it.  You love sucking the toes.  You like the toes.  You're a foot guy, huh?  Enough about the toes.  Yo, you know what you do?  You take the...  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on, toe sucker.  All right.  We've been trying to get the answer to this question for many, many, many years.  I understand fetishes.  I get fetishes in general, but I don't understand the foot fetish.  I don't get it.  I've always been into feet, dog.  You know, ladies' feet just exist.  But why?  But why?  And don't go into a long explanation.  I need something that hits me hard. 
[01:58:30]  Like, okay, I get it now.  Why feet?  Toe jam.  I'm into toe jam, dog.  On a toe jam, I put it on toast.  You know what I'm saying?  Toe jam on toast.  You're losing us, toe sucker.  No, I'm saying.  Man, it's been a good fetish since I've been a kid, man.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let's get to your Britney Spears, Ryan.  All right, yo, I know this blonde-headed broad named Britney that acts kind of weird.  And every three months, she grows a beard.  She has a lot of different skills and taught me to play the harp.  I was turned off by her toenails that are razor sharp. 
[01:59:00]  Feel me?  Huh?  He struck out at the plate.  Yeah, really?  Jesus.  He didn't even suit up.  That was the type of swing where the...  He's on injured reserve.  The bat flies out of your hand on a knuckleball.  He goes on the first base.  I wanted a real answer to that.  Why do you like toes?  That guy didn't like toes.  He was doing a character. 
[01:59:30]  It was a whole phony call.  The closest we got to the answer was like when you look at the toes, the space in between  the toes looks like cleavage, and you're on the ground as a kid, and so you feel like  you're looking at boobies all day.  No, I don't think it's that blatant.  Well, that's the best I've heard so far.  I don't think it's that blatant.  In our years of trying to figure it out.  It's just something, you know, you're attracted to different parts of the body, and that would  be a part that somebody's attracted to.  I've said in the past, I like the whole package. 
[02:00:00]  Like, I don't have a foot fetish, but I like when the whole package is nice and the feet  are cute.  I like that.  I don't like...  Like, Paris Hilton has talons.  They're these giant feet.  Talons.  They're these giant feet with big, like, ligaments.  You can see them coming through the top.  Ah!  Of these feet that are, like, one foot long, and they're just squeezed into high heels.  She probably has bunions and just big, like, ligaments that work her big, long, talon-like 
[02:00:30]  toes.  But you don't have to look at it.  Why look at the feet?  I don't look at feet.  That's disgusting.  How do you not look at them?  I really don't look.  When a girl is completely nude...  I'm looking at her feet?  Nude.  You look at the whole thing.  You give it to the head to toe.  And if they're bad feet, it could ruin the whole package.  Bad feet can ruin the whole goddamn package.  If they're gnarled up toes...  I hate to tell you, I'd never get to feet.  I'd never get to feet.  Never.  There's so many other things to look at. 
[02:01:00]  I'd rather look at other parts a second or third time.  Yeah, no, I understand.  But it's got to be the whole package.  What if they were chopped off?  You wouldn't care?  Girls walking around on two stumps, and you'd be like, that girl's just as hot as the girl  with two feet.  I would only care if, like, her leg was missing all the way up to her hip.  But if they're...  Okay, chopped off at the ankle.  No problem.  It's the same as if a girl had feet.  No problem.  Above the knee, it starts getting a little weird.  Just as hot as a girl with feet.  No problem.  Girl with no feet.  No problem.  You're a crazy person.  No problem.  Up to the hip, though, then it gets a little weird.  You're crazy. 
[02:01:30]  No problem, though.  Below the knee, no problem.  Above the knee, it starts to get a little strange.  A little weird.  Just a little bit, though.  Gotta have, like, pretty or cute feet.  Can I say that anything below the knee or above the neck can be thrown out?  Really?  All right, look, you don't like the move where you take your hands and you stick your fingers  like, okay, girl on back. 
[02:02:00]  Of course, you assume where you're supposed to be in that type of situation.  And you take the feet.  Girl on back.  Where am I supposed to be?  You're on the train.  You're in bed, silly.  Like, you're peeking through the window.  Yeah.  Screaming.  You take a girl's feet.  Yeah.  Push them up.  And you clasp your fingers through her toes.  Wow.  Like, between her toes. 
[02:02:30]  That gets freaky, Jimmy.  And then you've got, like...  That's got a little freak.  You got...  If the feet are, like, cute or pretty and stuff, that's kind of nice.  That's nice.  I couldn't imagine doing it with, like, gnarly-looking, like, man feet or something like that.  Ant's a bit into feet.  That's kind of cool.  A little bit.  Do you suck the toes?  No, I don't do that.  No, I'm not into...  I'm not into toe-sucking or anything.  But I'm into my...  The sense of touch on everything.  That's like it.  Feet, legs, calves, behind the knee. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Like, just like that.  I'll say that, like, locking the fingers and the toes like that, I'll do you one better.  I'll grab the foot and hold it in that position and smell it at the top of the toes.  That's more...  That's going further into a foot fetish than I have.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, Jimmy likes smells, too.  I've noticed that over the years.  I like armpit smells if I have a chemistry with you.  Really fast.  Strap a diaper over his head just so he can smell it.  By the way, the instant feedback happens every day. 
[02:03:30]  You go to opianthony.com.  There's a link.  And you comment about the show as it's going on.  Raul from whackbag.com.  It's the shoe thing, Opie.  High heels rule.  Well, my chick isn't allowed to wear high heels.  Isn't allowed?  Well, I mean, she's allowed to do whatever she wants.  But I actually got...  Wait, what?  I actually had to get a pair of shoes that have a little heel.  Because when my girl...  Oh, right.  Because when my girl...  Very tall. 
[02:04:00]  When my girl wears shoes with a heel, it's getting close.  She's not taller than me, but it gets a little close.  She's got a kind of Sonny and Cher thing going on.  Yeah, where her own family goes, boy, he's short.  I'm like, I'm not short.  I'm pretty close to six foot, but when she wears a shoe and a heel, it gets a little too  close for my comfort.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  We got to take a break.  He's running in here.  Oh.  Crazy Chick Day.  People have suggestions for that.  We got an explanation for the foot fetish.  And we'll play What Did You Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today. 
[02:04:30]  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony just got me wowed.  I just got wild!  To get your official Opie and Anthony wowed sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, we'll see you tomorrow.  We're running out of time here.  Must get off at 54.  Must get off at 54. 
[02:05:00]  Look at the clock.  Look at the clock.  Look at the clock.  Look at the clock.  We're going to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What an educational show, especially financially.  Yeah, more Boardroom Jimmy tomorrow.  We got Boardroom Jimmy over here.  Everybody should be a millionaire by the time the market opens.  People are requesting Boardroom Jimmy, but we're running out of time.  So tomorrow, you never know when.  But Boardroom Jimmy will make another appearance tomorrow.  Foot fetish, yes.  Let's talk to Dr. Matt from Philly.  Dr. Matt, listening on WYSP.  What's up there, Dr. Matt?  How's it going, guys?  How are you today? 
[02:05:30]  I'm doing all right, Dr. Matt.  How are you?  Let's make it snappy.  Well, no complaints here.  Just real quick, I want to let you guys know the foot fetish thing is actually a pretty  simple thing.  You know, people have very ticklish feet.  Yeah.  And it's a funny kind of thing.  It feels good.  And some people cross this over into sexual feelings.  And that's where the foot fetish comes from.  I wouldn't totally throw that theory away.  A lot of times when you're a kid, you do the coochie, coochie, coo on the feet.  Coochie, coochie, coo, Jimmy.  Coochie, coochie, coo.  Well, there's tickling.  All the same lines. 
[02:06:00]  All the same lines when you do numbers.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, Dr. Matt.  Dr. Matt, hold on a second.  Dr. Matt.  No, no.  Tickling is a fetish.  Like, I mean, it is a fetish.  I think, I mean, I'm not going to disagree with a good doctor, but I think feet goes beyond  that.  It represents submission.  It represents, I think, a taboo of seeing mother's little toes painted when you're  a lad crawling around.  And you see mommy's tootsies.  And they have little coral paint on them.  And all of a sudden, you get a little reaction.  And you're like, oh, oh.  Anything, any fetish that, well, you just talk. 
[02:06:30]  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, you know.  Any fetish that reflects on the mommy thing is amongst the creepiest things on the face  of this planet.  But they're based on that.  Unfortunately, it is.  Creepy.  Where do you think this fetish comes from?  I have a thing.  But when I'm with a girl, I like her to.  Is this, you're being real now?  Sure.  Sometimes we don't know.  Oh, yeah.  I want her to take off all my clothes.  Yeah.  And spank me with a phallic object and scream, wait till your father gets home.  See, that could stem from mom. 
[02:07:00]  Man, I don't know if you're joking or not.  Some would say.  It's so confusing.  Thank you.  Now, the weird thing.  I don't know what it means.  All right.  Dr. Loudmouth.  Speed round.  Well, you want to do crazy chick day, but I don't know.  Rick on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah.  I don't know if there's any girls into pain or whatever, but maybe they're into putting  out cigars or cigarettes on their legs or arms, and you can get a mic right on there  for the singeing sound.  I knew some crazy chicks did that.  Well, they allow that one lousy cigarette butt to a forearm for crazy chick day. 
[02:07:30]  I knew this crazy broad had scars on her forearm, and they were like about an inch long and  about a quarter of an inch wide, and they were burns.  And she said they were from contests she would have where they'd get to hammer drunk, put  their two girls or girl guy, whatever, would put their forearms together and drop a cigarette  between the two of them and see who pulls away first.  And these scars were like an inch long. 
[02:08:00]  You know how long a cigarette burning you to burn down an inch would take, oh, it seemed  like an eternity.  That's a horrible childhood.  That is just a pain.  That's a creepy older relative coming out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Running out of time, running out of time.  Oh, my God.  Quick, quick, quick.  Let's get off at 54, 54, 54.  Danny in Boston.  What's up?  Danny.  Hey, what's up?  I'm just calling in for a psycho chick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's your suggestion?  I think that you guys should get one of those industrial dryers, and I get about three 
[02:08:30]  chicks, and see who can spend the longest amount of time in the dryer.  Crazy chick in a dryer.  All right.  I like it.  Thank you.  Bobby on Long Island.  What's up?  What's your idea for crazy chick day?  Yeah.  I'm just saying they should just drink gallons upon gallons of water until they pass out  and die.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  I love having to drink the water until they drop dead.  Jeff and Queens, what's up?  I think they should come in and perform a little act with either their boyfriend or  girlfriend, and then you guys post it online, because all of these attention whores love 
[02:09:00]  being online, having their videos out, so have fun.  Crazy chick porno.  Crazy chick porno.  I like it.  Crazy chick porno.  Let's go to Steve and Brooklyn.  Steve, what's up?  What do you got for crazy chick day?  I haven't taken a handful of sleeping pills.  Handful of sleeping pills.  I like that very much.  Let's play what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Jared, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  We must get out at 54, 54, 54.  What do you got?  I learned that Dow Jones is her faggot.  Thank you, Jared.  Adam in Boston, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Make it quick. 
[02:09:30]  That you guys are on before Adam 12 in Boston.  Woo!  There's nothing wrong with that.  All right.  Hey, Jimmy, you're going to be at the Addison Improv in Dallas?  I will be tomorrow through Sunday.  Sunday.  While you're all watching the Oscars, I'll be sweating on stage, working on my bit on  Heather Mills, and coming up, let's see what's coming up.  We got JV and Elvis for the next three hours, and then my pal, Nick DiPaolo, at noon.  That's right.  Nick is very liberal.  Are you?  Oh, is he?  I love him.  Are you leaving our show to go on Nick DiPaolo's show? 
[02:10:00]  No, I just like Nick, and I have not seen him in a while.  All right, running out of time, running out of time.  I want to say hi to Joey, our friend Joey Paisano.  I went to Aqua last night, Sunrise Highway in Rockville Center.  Yeah, you might remember Joey from the old days, Paisano.  It was a mulberry street in the heart of Little Italy.  He sold that joint.  He's got a new restaurant called Aqua.  I was there, too.  Got a great review in the New York Times.  Yeah.  Newsday.  Got written up.  It's really, really good.  Nice.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  So if you're in the New York area, it's right there on-  Sunrise Highway in Rockville Center.  Yeah, it's unbelievable, actually.  Yeah.  I'm glad that Joey's doing-  Love Joey.  Doing great.  We were talking and laughing our asses off because he was saying, he goes, the Paisano  thing, he goes, I was there like maybe twice a week for like two hours.  Like the joke became, you know, if you see Joey down there, well, you're not going to  see him.  He goes, here, he's there all the time now.  It's like really, the place is busy.  He's like taking care of it.  It's a whole new operation.  Yeah.  He's got to work his butt off and he's doing great. 
[02:11:00]  Charlie in Jersey, we want to get off at 54, 54, 54, but this clock says 54.  This clock says 51.  Oh, my God.  A fan's watch has to be right.  It's fan's.  My BlackBerry's never wrong.  This says 852.  My phone says 847.  I don't know.  What time is it?  That says 853.  853.  How do we get off at 854 if we have 10 different clocks, 10 different things?  My phone is always right.  It's set by the atomic clock.  So what does yours say? 
[02:11:30]  853A.  Mine says 852A.  Oh, boy.  Yours is wrong.  Charlie in Jersey.  Mine's set from NORAD.  I learned today that Bubba...  Unplug the goddamn thing.  Yes, Charlie.  Sorry, Charlie.  I learned today that Bubba is a total homo.  All right.  You did learn that today.  He was trying to do it in the Bubba voice.  Let me tell you about these guys.  What?  Are they going to make the cut?  Oh, who knows?  Oh, I'll be fine if I don't make the cut, Bubba. 
[02:12:00]  That's the difference between me and you.  I don't need the attention, fatso.  I'm going to make the cut.  All right.  Jimmy, are you going to be on the show tomorrow?  Yes.  I believe for the first three cars...  What?  I believe for the first three hours we had to get a noon flight before me tomorrow night.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Thank you so much for the support.  Don't forget, we're in the middle of chaos, so bear with us.  But it is a lot of fun.  Chaos.  We...  Word with chaos.  Yeah, we love it. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  We're at peace with chaos.  Which is kind of weird.  All right.  I think it's 8.54.  Come on out.  Who knows, though?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're going over to XM.

[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing? 
[02:16:30]  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Cornwalls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM.  Let's get right into it. 
[02:17:00]  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Let's  Let's get right into it here  This is our dilemma with our radio show 
[02:17:30]  How's this for a dilemma?  This happens all the time no matter what we talk about on this radio show  You just heard Ecstasy of Gold, that's the Metallica version  I personally hate it  I think they could have done a lot more with the song  Instant feedback  Smokezilla from Whackbag  First time I've heard this guys  Nice find, like it  And then pretty much  Yeah, the next instant feedback that came in  Phil from Bethpage  When are you going to put the Metallica version of this song out to pasture? 
[02:18:00]  It's awful  No matter what we do  Someone loves it, someone hates it  You know that people were dying over Boardroom Jimmy  At the other joint today loving it  And then people going, oh this sucks  Well that is  I didn't know that  But that is our dilemma every day  That was me, I typed it in  But then honestly  This sucks  There's people that just don't understand the show whatsoever  Because that bit is just amazing  Yeah, it's part of the radio 
[02:18:30]  Some love it, some hate it  And fuck them  It's over the top  It's over the top  It's so good  That's what I say  But  I came up with that saying  Your brother  Yeah, my brother Joe called me yesterday and said  Who plays that Ecstasy of Gold at the beginning of the show now?  And I said, it's Metallica  You know, they do a version of it  He goes, it sucks  He goes, the beginning's kind of good  He goes, but then he just goes into this  And describes exactly what I said  He just kind of goes into this lead  That kind of isn't that good anyway  And loses the essence and feel of the original song 
[02:19:00]  Right  So he's like, give me two weeks  He goes, give me two weeks  And he'll, my brother will throw something together  Yeah  See what it sounds like  Because it doesn't sound like the song anymore  It just sounds like ho-ho-ho-y  Just  Ho-ho-ho-y  Just shredding  And it's not even like a good ho-ho-ho-y  Right  Like ho-ho-ho-y  He does a pretty good job with a lot of the songs  What makes that song so awesome  Is just how it builds  Yeah  There's so much emotion with the song  Yep  Dynamic  But all of a sudden, like 
[02:19:30]  It's dynamic  It starts off slow and then  Right into it  All right  You kind of missed a huge section of the song  Yeah  All right  Yeah, you need peaks and valleys  Oh my God, are we in the middle of chaos?  Chaos  Chaos  Chaos  My God, what's going to happen?  What does chaos mean to you?  I'm into murders and executions  Mergers and acquisitions  Love that  Very good 
[02:20:00]  All right  There was something we were going to do  We were going to do the XM part of the show  Wait a minute  They still haven't buried James Brown?  What?  They haven't buried Anna Nicole either  But James Brown's been dead for how long?  He died in 78  They still haven't fucking buried this guy?  Hey, at least they embalmed him  Yeah  Oh my God  It's great hearing the news from the courtroom yesterday  This was fantastic  The creepy corner calling on the speakerphone 
[02:20:30]  That's the dude with the lump that I keep talking about  With the lump on his head  The Gumby head  He calls up  And delivers just some awful news  And there's loved ones in the courtroom  Yeah  Regardless if this chick was fucking off or nut  Which she was  Anna Nicole Smith  You know, she did have people that cared about her  I guess  And then they have to hear like this horrible  Description of how she's rotting away 
[02:21:00]  Yeah  I don't think we have the clip  I'm not sure  Oh, it's horrible  Yeah, they got the creepy corner on the speakerphone  He's like  If we don't bury her this week  There will not be an open casket  Yeah, he said  There is noticeable decomposition taking place  And those  Anna Nicole is rotting away  And those creepy corners  They don't have any cooth  No  They don't know how to say awful things  To them, it's a friggin'  They work at Jiffy Lube  Yeah  It doesn't matter to them  It's another job  His phrasing was very tasteless though 
[02:21:30]  When he said  She is quickly becoming unfuckable  Even for me  Yeah, when an implant plops out of a rotting breast  And hits the floor  Right, yeah  You know there's a problem  The skin deteriorates  And all you're seeing is a bag  Yeah  It's time to bury her  It's like a mealy rotted apple  You squeeze her tits  And your fingers touch  The nails scrape each other  Fucking old mealy apple tits  Oh, it's horrible  I'd still fuck her  I'd fuck her in the mouth 
[02:22:00]  While she's dead like this  I'd fuck her in the mouth  Just for all the bad television  She fucking  She put out there  But the guy  How he describes it  He just gets so into it  Yeah  She's decomposing  Decomposing  Because you don't want to think about that  You don't want to think about it  You just kind of want to  Remember your loved one as they were  And that's it  Yeah  You don't want to think about that  Jaw dropping  That's what the  Steven Spielberg uses  In all of his movies  When they're walking through  You know, a cave  Or something like that  And the skeleton comes out 
[02:22:30]  And the head turns  And the jaw goes  And drops down  And that  Like the skeleton's going  And it's real creepy  I like old school  Skeleton heads  Where it's  Chop, chop, chop  What are you  Abbott and Costello  Meet the skeleton  What are you  Where they're going  The teeth are chattering together  It's like  I didn't even know  That part of the body  Just falls from you  It just kind of  Because when I was growing up  It was always attached  Yeah  But the reality is 
[02:23:00]  No, the lower jaw falls off  It'll fall off  Right now  As we do our radio show  There's a body  Somewhere  In a coffin  Somewhere  Where the lower jaw  Just separated  Right at the second  From the skull  It decided  Maybe it took  A year  Maybe it took  50 years  Who knows  But right now  A jaw is just going  And opening  In this horrific  Skeletal scream  Ooh, how awful is that 
[02:23:30]  I'm writing a movie  About skeletons actually  No, you're not  I am  It's where they're  Taking over the world  And they just fight  And they have swords  And do karate  Yeah  Ooh  That sounds scary  Yeah  It's called  Skeletons are coming  Working title?  Yes  I hope  And they're all just  Chopping people and stuff  It's really good  How do you fight them?  You have to punch them  In the ribs  But they're always  They're like night creatures  And stuff  So they wear hats  Your movie stinks  No, it's a good movie  Because  Oh, it's horrible  Yeah, they have  Like the little foot bones  And when they're doing 
[02:24:00]  Karate and stuff  And then there's  Dance numbers and stuff  Oh, dance numbers  Yeah  So it's a music  Where they're all  Holding canes and dancing  That's nice  Yes  Do they break?  Can you like  Hit them in the ribs  And their ribs  Will just shatter all over?  Now you have to  Throw magic potions  On them and fire  And fire  You have to throw  Fire on them  Like a wizard would  I think fire would hurt them  They dance  And they're taking over  The world  And you have to  Throw fire on them  As a wizard would  Your movie's awful  It's very good  It's very good  It's very good  It's a comedy  Kind of like horror drama  Oh, comedy horror drama musical 
[02:24:30]  Thing  Thing  We'll look for that  In chick flick  Comedy drama  Theaters  Thriller  Yeah, there's a romance  Where one of the skeletons  Becomes involved  With one of the hunters  Oh, that's good  Yes  But the skeleton's depressed  Because he can't have his ass eaten  Because it's rotted off  Look at Tham  He wants to audition for it  He's holding up a note  A bunch of skeletons  And an Avis  You don't get the part  Don't mention Avis  Or a wacky white skeletons  Listening to black music 
[02:25:00]  He almost forgot about the Avis thing  Oh, the Avis commercial  You had to bring it back  That we ruined for him  Oh, boy  Oh, that's awful  Oh, please  He actually was going to be  The next fucking Verizon guy  Nobody would have seen it  Can you hear me now?  Yes  Shit dick  Just remember this, Thana  Right about now  People would have forgot about you  You would have had that fame  For a little while  Right about now  Right about now  They would be on to the next guy  They aired the shit  Out of that commercial  They really did  Because I remember saying  Oh, this is the commercial  That Dan was going to be in 
[02:25:30]  Yeah  Oh, this is the commercial  That Dan was going to be in  Like a thousand times  Nice union gig  Sorry  Oh, I would have gotten  Your card and everything  Insurance  You have your card, right?  No  You don't have your SAG?  No  Why would he?  Oh, you poor bastard  You would have gotten  A SAG card, right?  If I'd gotten that gig  Oh, shit  Were they going to  Taft-Hartley you into SAG  They called?  Taft-Hartley  That's a clause  That you're not SAG  Well, you have to be SAG  To do things  But if you're not SAG  And you get it  They taft-Hartley you in  That's getting you in  Even though you're not a member  Because it's a catch-22  How can I get this gig 
[02:26:00]  If I'm not SAG  And yet, how do I get into SAG  If I can't get a SAG gig?  That's the question  Exactly  That everyone wants to know  The answer to  You bet they do  I've been getting emails  For years  We actually qualified  For our SAG card  When we did a commercial  Commercial  Yep  Oh, we did?  Yes, we did  I got all the forms  And everything  You should get it  They have better insurance  Than fucking AFTRA  Stinks  AFTRA actually agrees  To cover you  If your bill is between  Three and five dollars  Yeah  Cocksuckers  I fucking hate AFTRA  They're shit  They have done nothing for us  They're shit 
[02:26:30]  And I'm in general pro-union  This union that they have  For radio guys  Is the biggest joke  Yep  When we got  Whatever  We've got  American Federation of Television  We didn't even get one  Fucking phone call  From the union  When we got  Fired  And fucked  They're shit  By the company  Back in the day  But if you don't pay your dues  They'll be calling you  Wait, was there any threat  Like we're gonna take action  If they fuck you this hard?  They didn't do anything  They did nothing  SAG is a much better  We had a great case too  Cause we did nothing wrong that day  Believe it or not 
[02:27:00]  I know  I know that sounds crazy  But  They're trying to get  The creepy coroner  And what he said  On the speakerphone  Holy shit  What the fuck  Clip is that?

[02:34:30]  And you know  The face of the disease  Might show  Color change  At which  Well the court's  Going to render a decision  By the end of this week  That's all  Let the chips fall  As they may  Just cremate  This idiot  She's deteriorating  At an accelerated rate  And the judge is just  Come on  He's trying out  For a TV show  The guy thinks

[02:36:30]  Please do not get mad at me  For putting my two cents in  And if you would rather  That I not comment  Please let me know  Thanks  Take care  Why would it be bad  To mention Bubba  Why would that be bad  Well  They're over there  At a company  That is merging  You guys might not  Be included  You know  There's every possibility  You could be destitute  So you better play it safe  He's just looking out for us 
[02:37:00]  We're too stupid  Not to talk about it  To take anyone's advice  Even if it's good advice  The guy's a fucking cunt  Who mouthed off about us  And if everything he said  Comes true  And we get the boot  So be it  He could have a chuckle about it  And that's great  But it ain't gonna stop us  From calling the guy  What he is  A hack  No one's fucking  Paying attention to him  And screw him  I only want the best 
[02:37:30]  For you boys  I understand  You're like  The angel  On one shoulder  And then there's  The devil  On the other shoulder  Right  And the devil  Is throwing flames  At your hair  Because he knows  It's gonna catch  Right on fire  And burn your little halo  Alright  I got another mission  To attend to  What's your mission?

[02:38:30]  Oh, God  Even when he said it  He sold it  It's a cute head  That one of cocks back  When he's sleeping  That head just leans back  Oh, I know  But right  Right where it's supposed to have  A little more mass  It just doesn't  No, just tapers  Anyone else notice that?  Like a brontosaurus head  That's why Cannon never eats lunch with us  Because he's always out  Like finding a tree  Handlessly enjoying some leaves  G.H., I'm gonna be late  I'm stuck in a tar pit 
[02:39:00]  Or I'm extinct  Well, yeah  That would be the early stage  Of being extinct  Yeah  He doesn't like Travis  He looks like a little velociraptor  I'm scared of him  I'm a mere vegetarian  When all these other dinosaurs  Are carnivorous  They use me for food  I could be eaten  Dinosaur  It's your asshole park 
[02:39:30]  All right, Kenny  Thank you  Thank you, Kenny  I'm gonna take care of that thing  All right  Let's go to Oliver  And St. Louis  He lumbers off  What's up?  St. Louis  My name means  Thundalizard  Sorry, yeah  St. Louis  He's laughing at a brontosaurus  What's up, boys?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, I saw that Anna Nicole video, man 
[02:40:00]  Looks like she put that makeup on  With her ex-husband's limp cock  Yeah, there was  It was pretty sloppy  And he bailed  Okay, here it is  So this is the audio  From the clown footage  She's fucked up  And she's at least  Eight months pregnant  And Howard K. Stern  Thinks it's hilarious  And is like  Are you on mushroom?  Of course he does  And I don't think he's joking  They're so in love  I think he's trying to  You know  I don't know what he's trying to do  Actually  I think he just never really cared 
[02:40:30]  Anna  Anna  Anna  Anna, look at me  Riley thinks she's absolutely  Lost her mind  Huh?  Riley thinks she's lost her mind  I can't lose my mind  She thinks she has  I didn't  Is this a mushroom trip?  Huh?  Is this a mushroom trip?  Huh?  Is this a mushroom trip?  What do you mean?  I'm kidding 
[02:41:00]  What does that mean?  I'm kidding  I gotta tell you  I'm really surprised she's dead  Yeah  Well, she does baby talk  I was thinking  Maybe I should use a mushroom  When I'm eight months pregnant  The  She  Yeah  Obviously  It's fucked up  It was supposed to end like  Like it did  With her rotting somewhere  In a morgue  Yes  20 degrees  She's currently at 20 degrees  Apparently people really need to be a little low 
[02:41:30]  They need to lower that  Like the refrigerator  When you  When you take out the milk  And go  You know  Where's that little dial?  This needs to go down a little more  Could you imagine some janitor  Just like  Turns up the heat  Doesn't know what he's doing  And  Wow  She'd rot real quick  That'd be hilarious  That'd probably happen  You know  What the fuck did you do?  And then just  Turn it back down  Turn it back down  She's all rotted  Maybe no one will notice  No one will notice  Get some spackle  Pick that breast up  And put it where it was  More clown footage 
[02:42:00]  What happened?  Broke me out  Jimmy what happened?  I'm eating  And you just picked that breast  It just hit me  It's disgusting  Oh  Well you're  Why are you chewing something soft right now?  Angry eating on the air guy  It's a turkey wrap  All right 
[02:42:30]  Here's more clown footage  I said this footage is worth money  Why?  What footage?  This thing you're looking into?  It's a camera  Exactly  She said it like Sam  It's a camera  It's a camera  My head is full of candy  And I got rosy cheeks  And I'm half Negro  Half 
[02:43:00]  One hundredth  All right  Yeah  One one hundredth  There he is  Look at him  I like curly hair  Like Sam  It's a camera I'm looking into  Could you put it in a bag?  Let's go to Les the trucker  Les what's up?  Hey how's it going?  What's up Les?  Hey this is uh  I just want to point out  That that judge on that first clip  Kind of sounded a lot like Kenny  Yeah he's got a weird weird like uh delivery 
[02:43:30]  Very strange  I do?  No  And he is not about you douchebag  And he's so grandstanding  He knew the whole world was watching yesterday  A lot of us anyway  The judge definitely sounds like some type of a waterhead  Yeah  All right thank you sir  All right appreciate it  Brian from New York  I was at a party on Saturday  Kathy from the Preston and Steve show  All right  They got a hole? 
[02:44:00]  I guess  She knows who we are  I have no clue who Kathy is  Got a hole  Uh  Was there  Talking shit about you guys  I think you guys should take it back to the old school  And attack in the most vicious vile way  The way the pests love  Who the fuck is she?  Kathy  They have a hole?  Everyone just loves  Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip about us  Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip  Yip yip yip yip yip yip  Get up  I listened to Preston and Steve  I heard quality morning radio  Obviously very well prepared 
[02:44:30]  News and traffic  Really John Manelli  She does news and traffic?  She's the news and traffic girl  Love when they go to that  Love when you just gotta stop dead in your tracks  And go to some  Woman doing news and traffic  Yeah  All right  Howard K. Stern in court says  His relationship with Anna was not exclusive  In 2000 you started to have a more  Personal intimate relationship with her?  Yes  And it was not  It was not exclusive  Because of my relationship as her attorney 
[02:45:00]  And it's something that we didn't disclose to too many people  But  And she had other boyfriends in between  I wanted her to be happy  God what a mess this guy is huh?  The guy's a scumbag  He's obviously  Like that was his meal ticket  I mean he's  How ethical could this guy be?  He's an attorney?  Yeah you're not allowed to fuck your clients  Yeah you can't fuck your clients 
[02:45:30]  You can fuck them over  You just can't literally  Right  Fuck them  You can't fuck them  No  And he was  He's part of some reality show that she was on  Watching her just  Drugged out of her mind  Dragging herself around in front of cameras  And he was fine with it  Yeah yeah no problem with that  And like I said  Meal ticket  And now he's trying to the bitter end  As a body rots away  To try to just pluck whatever money he can  He's a real live human vulture 
[02:46:00]  Instead of grabbing at her rotting carcass  He's grabbing at whatever pieces of cash he can find  That was going to be great  Remember when that Cuban kid was yanked out of the house?  That was some great  Great comedy  That was hilarious  That was hilarious  And we're going to have another one of those  Young Ileon Gonzalez  You think they're going to go and grab him from the Bahamas?  Oh they're coming for that kid eventually  And that is going to make for some hilarious TV  Grab that baby 
[02:46:30]  Remember that wish of a woman?  Oh yeah  Just running out of the house with the baby  Yeah  Practically falling down  Couldn't get it in the van fast enough  That was a good one  Little Ileon  The uh  Well  Obviously this kid  They should just throw it away  It's going to be a mess  Throw it out with the bath water  Just throw it out with the bath water  Throw out the baby with the bath water  Just get it a poll for its first birthday  Yeah  There's the great picture of Ileon 
[02:47:00]  Crying with a machine gun pointed at him  Yeah  And they say he wasn't affected by this  Yeah okay  Alright  Hey you see interviews with him now  He's great  He's friends with Fidel  Yeah  He's Fidel's best friend now  Doing very good in Cuba  Alright here we go  Uh  Howard says he and Anna were to be married legally this week  Anna wanted our marriage to be a legal marriage  I had some concerns because I was concerned about how people would perceive it  I was concerned that people would think that I'm making a run for her money 
[02:47:30]  Did you exchange wedding vows?  Absolutely  We got married  You got married on this boat?  For God  Absolutely  He then revealed the two were to make their union legal  When were you supposed to marry him?  Supposed to do it this week  Yeah  You were planning this week to get married?  Yes  How convenient  Yep  Yeah  Oh is this guy despicable  Well this next clip  Howard says Anna asked for the casket to be open so she could hug her son's body at the funeral 
[02:48:00]  This was creepy yesterday  Yeesh  So they're at the funeral and she's just losing her mind  At the son's funeral  Yeah  Yeah  And she insisted they open up the casket  And then she kind of jumped in and was hugging him and holding him and stuff  Oh my  Oh what a creepy mess  Oh my god  Why would you do that?  Oh my god  Oh my god  That's terrible  Oh my god  She's in the coffin  She's in the coffin 
[02:48:30]  Look at the son  The market opened  Fructose  Up to twelve dollars  Jimmy  Wow  I've heard that from somebody  There's a very knowledgeable fellow  Talking to fructose  Very knowledgeable guy  He said buy fructose today  I would have disagreed  But I will now concur  Twelve bucks  Here's the clip about her jumping in the casket with her dead son  Before the ceremony started  She had the people open the casket  And she  Whoa 
[02:49:00]  Alright we got more of the video of the day  That's clip of the day man  Alright what was it?  A gas line explosion?  Officer Ben Henrik  Look at him  He is  The blast is on camera  The blast is on the camera  That was in the police car  The car is on the street  A car or a truck hit the gas line  So the cops must have been walking up to the house  And the whole house exploded  You just see pieces of house flying out into the street  And then you see the two officers completely you know dazed 
[02:49:30]  I'm not sure if it's a house still in it  Really?  I think that's snow and stuff  It looked like pieces of a house  Can we find out?  Yeah we're getting it right now  Oh and a cow's loose in Massachusetts  What the hell?  That ain't a cow  What the hell is that?  One of our female listeners  Oh okay  That thing should be up in Canada somewhere  Isn't that animal extinct?  Yeah it's like Kenny  Isn't that like a  It's like Kenny  Did we just find a woolly mammoth in Massachusetts?  That's what it looks like  Like a mammoth  What the hell was that? 
[02:50:00]  A Lebanese producer  I don't want to be captured  I'm a person  I ran out of wax and couldn't afford the lasering  My arms are always smooth  Alright here's uh  How many Steve impressions is he gonna do?  Well we were all thinking that  Here we go  Before the ceremony started  She had the people open the casket  And she was just inconsolable 
[02:50:30]  And hugging Daniel  Both before and after the ceremony  Anna required that the casket be opened  Against um  What I thought would have been best  Oh  Yeah  Open up the casket  I want to say goodbye to Daniel  People do weird things when they're grieving 
[02:51:00]  What can I tell you?  They certainly do  That's just creepy though  Howard says Anna cuddled with a picture of her son every night  There's a big  Almost like a poster sized picture of Daniel  That's in a frame  That she cuddled with in her bed  And would literally cry herself to sleep  Physically she died last week  But in a lot of ways emotionally she died when Daniel died  Oh boy yeah 
[02:51:30]  Poetic isn't that  That's very  Yeah  She was a sweet girl  Big tennis fat clown  Yeah  Contributing nothing but phony TV  She's a stripper who just fucked an old guy  Yeah  We can't get enough of it though  I respect her  The ratings for these news shows  They were saying up like 50%  Something like that  Because they're all doing their coverage  Except for CNN  Oh CNN has refused to  It was pretty amazing  Situation room  They don't want to  Well MSNBC and Fox  They went live  It was some great courtroom drama crap  I'm sure a lot of people checked it out 
[02:52:00]  It was on for like an hour  Hour and a half  And CNN was talking about like  I don't know  Something silly like Iran and nukes or something  Will you stop  Stop already  Get to the entertainment  Yeah will you please  You're trying to actually do news  And we're the first people  To jump down their throat  Oh of course  You know for not doing news  For not doing it  But yesterday I'm like  What are you doing  Were they calling it the  Hearing of the century  Right  Wait was it  Was Wolf Blitzer in the situation room  With that awful music bed he stands  Very important music 
[02:52:30]  The situation room  With all his TV screens behind him  Yeah why don't you just sit in a chair  Because I'm in the situation room  But why doesn't the situation room have a chair  You can't be in a situation sitting  Have you ever been in that situation  And you're sitting  Many times  No  Why don't they call it a standuation room  Yeah  Give me one example  Excuse me  One example what  Wait where's my new clip  No that wasn't even close  See that clip only works  I love that clip 
[02:53:00]  I know but you gotta use it  Sparingly  Sparingly  It only works when it's close to being good  You're trying to tell us to do something sparingly on this show  I know  Have you lost your mind  Yes  By the way aunt  Chris from Minneapolis  The cop in the explosion was at a house  Woman drove a truck into a house  Cop tries to help  Smells gas  Woman starts car  What  Oh what a dope  Cop flies  Farewell and adieu 
[02:53:30]  All you fair Spanish ladies  Did she die  I guess so  She tried to start up the car  Oh she's dead  Yeah  You're kidding  Oh no you see the cop dazed  Yeah  Confused  Walk in front of the camera  After the explosion  So they smelt natural gas  Or gasoline  I don't know  Uh  Because that seemed like a natural gas explosion  It was uh  I didn't see a lot of  I heard gas line  Fire  Gas line  If it's natural  Yeah then it would probably be a gas line  Gas line  Yeah gas line  Probably natural gas from the house 
[02:54:00]  Yeah  Yeah  And then uh  Wow that fast huh  Boom  Boom  See a house come apart like that  We're gonna take a little  That's how the house laughs  A little breaky  Fucking Chinese  What  What's  Fucking Chinese  Jimmy just sits there going  Did you just say fucking Chinese  I'm sorry  I didn't  I just  I'm reading this thing about fur  And the fucking Chinese  What's wrong with the Chinese fur  Enough with them  We're gonna all love fur eventually  Because the Chinese are coming 
[02:54:30]  How many times do I have to tell you  The Chinese are on their way  Do you know fake fur  Made from real fur  Does not even compare  To real fur  Maybe not  But they skin the animals alive  I've seen footage of it  It's just  It's fucking  If they did it to Benny Hill music  Yeah what if they did it to Benny Hill music  It wouldn't be as bad  What if they did it to Benny Hill music  It would kind of be funny  I know  The little blinking  Sad animal  With no skin  Oh god  That's hard  They should make people watch this shit though  Man  They should make people watch this stuff  You gotta skin the animals alive 
[02:55:00]  Because if  Why do you have to do that  Well because if you kill them first  The shock of being killed  Wrecks the field of fur  Yeah  Makes it all hard and stiff  Yeah they get a little  With fright  That little adrenaline  Fucks up the fur  And no one wants that  They pick the little animals up by their feet  I thought they put electrodes in their ass  They do that as well  But this one  They pick them up by their feet  They smash their heads  On the  Alright  Wait  Describe it  Describe it for everybody  They'll pick up the animal  By its little feet  And smash its skull on the ground  And they take a knife 
[02:55:30]  Yeah  And they cut around like the legs  Uh huh  Like cutting a cuff almost  You know the hands  Right  And they just  Squirt around the neck  And they just  Just rip it down  The way you would rip off  Like a painter jumpsuit  Oh  And uh  When they fucking  Throw the animal to a bin  Into a bin  And it's still alive  They don't kill it  It's still alive  See somehow  It wasn't that bad  See  It's got no fur  It's probably cold  Even though it's hot out  How long could he be cold 
[02:56:00]  Okay now  I want to hear the same story again  Um  Same exact story  They'll uh  They'll take the animal  By its little animal feet  Yeah  And they'll smash its skull  Into the ground  And then they take a knife  And they cut around its ankles  And they cut around its wrists  And they begin peeling the fur down  While it's alive  Just ripping it off  They're skinning the animal alive  For its fur  That's horrible  So  So some girl can walk around 
[02:56:30]  With fur  And feel glamorous  And then they take the animal  Skinless  Like a little chicken  Yeah  They don't even give it  One of these under the chin  They don't even give it  A little  Under the chin  Goddamn rich cunt  This is  Wearing the uh  The fur  Yeah  I've kind of really  Gotten on the side of fucking  People that throw paint  On people wearing fur  Oh  Not that crazy  I know  I know 
[02:57:00]  I've gotten  I've become  One of them  Do you think  There could be  A way  To take  An animal's fur  And uh  Kill the animal  Humanely  Possibly sure  And do you think  That happens  In places  But the only places  That get the publicity  Are these awful places  In China  And stuff  And  So  Everyone thinks  That's the way  Every single piece of fur  Is gotten  To answer your question  Probably not 
[02:57:30]  Do I think it happens  Humanely  Maybe more humanely  Than that  But electrodes  Up the ass  I mean  Because what happens  Is I think  When you get  In that business  It becomes  An assembly line  Like any other job  And man  You gotta do it  The most efficient way  I mean look at the Germans  They were killing Jews  The most efficient way  Was to smash their heads  With a rifle  Because you didn't  Use bullets  That was considered  The most cost effective way  Yeah yeah  But I mean  Like they did  Cost effective ways  Then they figured it out  I like the  I like your  Logic though  I like that  Because  I do know 
[02:58:00]  That they lulled to sleep  That little turkey  They sang him  A little gobbly song  And when he was asleep  They slowly pulled his parts apart  And made him into that  Lovely wrap you're eating  Even when I say  To this turkey  Nice neck  Cunt face  I am certainly  A bit of a hypocrite  But I'm not  Chickens by the way  There is a chicken  They never even get to  The holocaust  You're right  A chicken holocaust 
[02:58:30]  Going on in this country  Right now  And I love chicken  Eat it all the time  Don't care  Don't care about  The chicken holocaust  But the way they  Treat chickens  From the beginning  When they're first  Hatched  Till they get their  Heads lopped off  And get hacked up  Into our food  Is just  Unbelievably cruel  You're correct  And it makes me  Like certain things  Like veal  I won't  You're right  But why not veal  I'll tell you the difference  Here's the difference  Between  I mean like  You're raised on food  You're raised eating meat 
[02:59:00]  I mean we are carnivores  Obviously we don't need it anymore  Because of supplements  And all this shit  But I mean  There is something  A little bit more natural  About that  Than the vanity  Of what wearing fur has become  It's not the old days  Where people wore it  Out of necessity  Like you know  Look  Nugent's the guy I don't mind  Even though he's  You know  Thank you very much  Thank you  Uncle Ted  We'll take over  I can't scratch the ear  Thank you very much  Sit back  Uncle Ted  We know Ted  You're a firecracker  You can't mention Ted Nugent  Without doing the impressions  Of course you can't  Well what about the  Hall of time  Hall of white bullets  Don't exist  Police officers are always 
[02:59:30]  Getting shot  But I'm by little guys  Thank you  Uncle Ted  You sit down  I'll talk  You listen  Uncle Ted  I'll do all the heavy lifting  I'll do all the heavy lifting  You just sit down  And eat your own stuff  Liberal  Thank you Uncle Ted  Alright we know Ted  You're just a dopey radio guy  I'm the expert  Thank you  You're the genius  Ted  We get it  Get out of his way  He's coming through  We get it  It's one of my faves by the way  But a guy like that 
[03:00:00]  I don't think is a bar  I mean I really think  He uses stuff  I don't think  I mean  I think there's a difference  Between that  And just some  Entitled twat  Getting a $25,000 coat  Because her husband  Who is probably  Fucking his secretary  Appeases her  By buying  It's just  To me it's disgusting  Yeah  I love when they  Throw paint on people  When you're wearing fur  And they throw paint on you  Not only do I want it  To ruin your jacket  But I hope it ruins your watch  And gets in your mouth 
[03:00:30]  And eyes  You know what  I love when this happens  When some dope  With a can of paint  Throws it on someone  Wearing a fake fur  Yeah of course  Because they're an  Animal rights activist  Also  But like the look of  Fur  So they buy fake fur  Very high quality fake fur  So it looks good  And then get some dolt  That throws paint on it  See animal rights activists  Don't even wear fake fur though  Most of them probably  Why would they not do that  Because I think  They don't want  That's a silly thing too  Because they don't want  They want to just 
[03:01:00]  Get rid of that look  That whole look  Bugs them  That's just my theory  But what about  The veal chicken thing  Jimmy  Well I mean look  Veal to me  I mean obviously  Chicken is  They have awful little  Fucking chickeny lives  Chickeny lives  But veal are raised  And they're kept in a place  Where they can't even stand  Most of the time  So they don't get  Chickens too though  Yeah they hormone  The shit out of them  So they got these  Big breasts  They topple over  Onto their own breasts  Alright when I make it hot  I know really  Jesus  And you know  Veal 
[03:01:30]  It's good  Pork chops are good  Bacon's good  That motherfucker  About having  Some personality  Some personality  Like fucking Arnold  From Green Acres  I don't  I do eat meat  I wish I didn't  But I do  I'm still not strong enough  To give that up yet  Would you  Yes of course I would  You would do that  As a moral thing  Or a health thing  Both  As a moral thing  I think it is healthier  You're a weird motherfucker  I just don't like  Cruelty to weakness  Like  It's not cruelty  It is  It's the right 
[03:02:00]  Of the top of the pyramid  To do that  If someday  Some fucking alien  Comes down here  And decides  We taste good  We're fucked  And until then  I don't  I'll eat  Whatever the fuck  I please  Well that's  Everyone's option  But I'm saying  That the right  To do it  Because we're  At the top  Of the food chain  I mean  I'm not saying  We don't have  We don't have  The strength  To do it  But that's like  Saying that we have  The right to kill children  Or to just throw  Them out the window  I mean please  I'm all for it  Love to  But because 
[03:02:30]  We're bigger  On the food chain  As adults  I mean you have  To have a certain  Amount of compassion  And a certain  I just don't think  It's necessary  And yes I do eat meat  Yes I'm being a hypocrite  I know all that  But I mean  It does bother me  The way it's done  And it's not  Necessary anymore  It is absolutely  Necessary  I don't think  We need  We have too many  People to feed  And you  How many millions  Of fucking chickens  Have to die  And be prepared  To be eaten  Every day  So what do we  Grow  Then the whole  Fucking country  Would have to be  Wheat  Let's just wipe out 
[03:03:00]  The Chinese  See we need land  We would need  Land like that  Then we would become  Less miles to feed  We would have to  Look to other countries  Not like we do for oil  For food  Because we couldn't  Possibly feed  The entire country  On vegetarian food  How could we do that  Look we feed people  In space  We send people  In rocket ships  And we feed them  For a month  On a very odd thing  Do you think  This country  Could sustain itself  300 million people 
[03:03:30]  By just growing vegetables  One word  Tofu  Yeah tofu  Sure  Oh fuck you  I'd be a starved  Motherfucker  Tofu  Don't tell me  You can press that  And make it look  Like a steak  And it's gonna  Taste like a steak  You can make tofu  I'd rather have  The fucking  Brundle steak  That came out  Of the other side  Tofu  No  I will tell you  One thing  I don't like tofu  Tofu either  Tofu stinks  And most garden  And veggie burgers  Are atrocious  Now there's some  Good brands out there  A couple of good  Brands though  Honest to god  And I fucking  Hate veggie burgers 
[03:04:00]  Yeah  There's a couple  Of brands I've eaten  I want to say  Morningstar  That were fucking  Really good  Like cheese on it  Or whatever  I mean it's really good  And I  I just like it  For health reasons  I thought it was  A little bit healthier  Because  It probably is  For cancer  And shit like that  Obviously  But the thought  Of trying to feed  300 million people  On what is grown  On farms  In this country  Would be  Impossible  I think we could do it  As well as  Making food  You guys  There's crazy reactions  Coming in  Kevin from Naples 
[03:04:30]  Coming from Jimmy  Who likes to be  Shit on  He doesn't like  Cruelty to the weak  No  I don't  I never did  Like speed  Hold on  Hold on  That's disingenuous  Mr. Torrance  That's disingenuous  I'm going to use that  All the time  And Mr. Torrance  I noticed this too  Mr. Torrance  But I just want to  Just let it pass  But oh well  You don't like  Cruelty to weakness  You ass  That's what this show  Is based on 
[03:05:00]  Yeah it's true  Our whole fucking  Income is based on  Cruelty to weakness  So as Jimmy said  I'm like  I'm making believe  I gotta like  Straighten things up  Cruelty to weakness  Why  Who's the asshole  That does that  And then we got one  For Anthony  That's  Anthony  This is from Craig  In PA  Anthony you are a  Fucking Neanderthal  Asshole  God damn it  God damn it 
[03:05:30]  That means no I'm not  You're an arrogant douche  Sometimes  Arrogant douche  Hold on  What's an  You know what  You can't take  Fucking reality  Douchebag  I'm speaking  Reality  This is the way  The fucking world  Rotates  Motherfucker  Don't call me  An insensitive  Or  Neanderthal  This is how  The world really is  Oh we live on  Fucking Vulcan  With Mr. Spock  Jimmy over here  It would be wonderful  If we could all be nice  To the animals  I want a lamb 
[03:06:00]  To pet with my right hand  And a lion  To pet  Pet with my left  And I want them  To snuggle  With each other  At night  It don't work that way  It's survival of the fittest  Just like the lion  Grabs a leopard  A leopard  A zebra's neck  In the fucking jungle  That's what we do  But only we do it  With machinery  I didn't finish  If a lion  Didn't have to do that  He probably wouldn't  A lion would sit there  With cutlery  And fucking prepare  Some broccoli  For it's pride  The difference is 
[03:06:30]  As we get more and more  Technologically advanced  And we know more  About nutrition  And stuff like that  I'm not saying meat  Is all bad  But I do think  That you're healthier  I mean  Like for cancer  And stuff like that  I think that the cancer cells  Love meat  It's just  It's not as healthy  To eat it  I mean  Yeah  I would say  Anything in moderation  Because people have said that  I mean  A pure vegetarian diet  Is it as healthy  As eating anything  Moderately  I don't know  I don't think it is  To tell you the truth  I think you're missing out 
[03:07:00]  On some essential stuff  Not with vitamins  Not with vitamins  I think with vitamins  You think vitamin supplements  Would help  Yeah  Patty McGee  From Jersey  Jesus Christ  Where'd it go  You guys got these  These guys are reacting  Big time  I stopped eating eggs  Because they're chicken periods  And then we got  And then we got  Stephanie from Chicago  That's what I say  Stephanie from Chicago  Is behind  Because she's listening  Probably on WCKG  They're an hour behind us  Right now  She writes  Why do you guys 
[03:07:30]  Hate women so much  I listen to you  Almost every day  And you're always  Demeaning to women  What did we do  First you had  Fatty Pig Fatty  Which we did about  Half a year ago  Just for women  Not all those  Fat ass guys out there  Now you want  Crazy chick day  What  Oh god  What's wrong with you  Jackasses  To answer your question  It's because you're cunts  Here's what I would do  Couldn't find the button 
[03:08:00]  Dammit  I want to put a horse  In the water  Another thing I fucking  Walked by yesterday  And hated  Was these fucking  Cocksucker tourists  That take these  Buggy rides  Here in New York  See that's something  I could get on board  They should be  Fucking banned  In Lancaster  We took one  Because that's open  We might have had  Country  Might have had  Eight cars passed  You're kind of  A whole buggy ride  You're kind of  In a farm  Yes 
[03:08:30]  You're not walking  By in a city  Where they're being  Beeped at  These animals  Are just  I mean these  Are animals  That live in a barn  They come out  They fucking  Stand in the outdoors  Dude I'm way with you  And you're not  Putting it to death  That's where  I step in  I will say  Yes  I don't like  The frigging  Buggies in New York  Because there's traffic  There's exhaust  And the sweltering heat  The cold  But they're not  Being used for anything  But like food  So they're  You know  They're being treated cruelly  Well call me crazy  Just to add to that  All right crazy  I don't think 
[03:09:00]  I don't think  They're into  Just being beeped at  All day  Yeah  I don't think  When God  Put a horse  On this earth  That he  He gave him  A defense mechanism  For cabbies  Beeping on  Because they  They need to get  To the next  Fair quicker  As possible  And their whole  System  Of their  Hooves  And muscles  And legs  Are not made  To walk on  Asphalt all day  It doesn't matter  What kind of shoes  You put on these things  It's not made for it  It's these  Piece of shit  Vultures  Who make a living 
[03:09:30]  Off them  It's the horses  I mean most of the tourists  Are just people  Who want to do something  Nice in Central Park  But it's these  Fucking  Piece of shit  Fucking  Uneducated  Fucking  Vultures  That have to make  A living off  Fucking  Making a horse's  Life miserable  You fucking  Cunts  I mean can't we  Just use Chinaman  Absolutely  Why not  There's more  Differentiating  Between the horses  Than there is them  The way they  Barbarically treat  Everything on the  Fucking planet  They put that  Stupid top hat on 
[03:10:00]  And they dress in  Like a tux and tails  And it's like  You're going for a run  Like it's 1880  Alright well  What's 1880  Why not  1880  1880 is a better year  You know what I know  What happened in 1880  Like 18  Let's see what happened  In 1880  Yeah as long as  It's before 18  Like 85  And speaking of  I call it the good old days  At top of the food chain  By the way  For a long time  I mean that was  That was kind of  What the thinking  Of slavery was  It's like  We were top of the food chain  The white people  With the powerful  So you're seeing my point  Yes of course  But that's 
[03:10:30]  I mean like  If you're going to go  With the top  Of the power base  Well black people  Back then  Were seen  And not during  The entire time  Of slavery  But at the beginning  I mean  I'm even talking  You know  1600  Yeah yeah  1700  They were not seen  As humans  Right  And when Europeans  Went to Africa  And saw these people  They were shaped  Like human beings  But they did not act  And were not treated  Like humans  Well they knew  They were human  They were just  Treating them subhuman  They just weren't  Treating them like  I mean they knew  They were humans  I don't think they knew  They were human back then 
[03:11:00]  They did  I really don't think  They did  They were not acting  Like human  They were acting  Like some kind of  Think about it back then  At first  Their whole mindset  Was like  It looks human  But obviously  It's not  It's some type of  Very close looking  Animal  To us  That can do work  And take some orders  They were so  Savage  Uncivilized  I won't excuse  The Europeans  By saying  By giving them that out  They knew what  They were doing  Alright  The Europeans  No  No they did  You need to start 
[03:11:30]  Having sex  With hookers again  When you look  At what they did  And fucking  Look at the way  People have treated  Each other  Or like Napoleon  Was  I mean  It's not like  This is 10,000 years ago  This is a few hundred years ago  They recognized humans  They knew they were human beings  They just  Didn't give a fuck  I don't know  Let's say how to Mike and I  Boy  They wouldn't recognize him  Me and Jimmy are disagreeing  So much during our arguing today  But it's good though  Yeah  It's the way it should be  Well  I guess you guys  Gotta agree to disagree  Maybe we should just  Agree to disagree  Well we can't only 
[03:12:00]  Disagree on slavery  I mean there's no way  To back that up  Nah  Well  After your point  I just have to say  I guess we'll have to  Agree to disagree  Agree to disagree  On that emancipation proclamation  This turkey by the way  I have a document  That says this turkey  Hung itself  I only eat the meat  Of suicide animals  Suicide meat  Now that's something  There you go  You're back  Oh  Alright let's say hi  To Mike in Iowa  Mike  Yeah  Hey  Yeah  Anthony's full of shit 
[03:12:30]  When he's saying  That you know  We couldn't feed the country  Just on vegetables  You lose  I have a degree  In agriculture  Alright  I'm a meat eater  But you lose  50%  Of the value  Of the grain  When you process  It through  To produce meat  It gets  You know  Pissed and shit out  So you know  In Diet for a Small Planet  Which was a popular book  I don't know  Some 30 years ago  They talked about 
[03:13:00]  The you know  How you lose  A lot of the value  Of the you know  The grain  You know  Processing it  And you can get  Your essential amino acids  By combining  For instance  Milk  And peanut butter  You know  And things like that  So what do you do  At a party  When a girl  Is not gonna fuck you  Which is every time  You mention this to a chick  Look dude  I'm on your side  And you're fucking  Making me hate you  I wanna go out  And kick a lamb 
[03:13:30]  Right in the cunt  And I wanna wear  Its fur  While it's alive  And then laugh at it  And teabag it  Fuck you  Coke logic  From whack bag  Oops  Teabag  1880  February 2nd  The first electric streetlight  Is installed  In Wabash Indiana  Alright  Wabash  Salute  Wabash  Yes  Something else  Stan  Yes Stan  Stan's gotta grab  The microphone  Actually  Yes  What I have is  Wabash was the first town 
[03:14:00]  To be completely illuminated  Oh  By electric  No it wasn't  Wabash is a shithole  Wabash  I've been to Wabash  Wabash  It's fucking dark  The old Wabash cannonball  Used to come through there  Let's go to Pat  In Westchester  Pat  Hey you doing guys  Hey  Pat  I'm wondering  Yeah  I'm just wondering  Why you guys always talk  About Howard Stern  All the time  Ridiculous  Last couple weeks  All right  This has to be a joke  Come on  You're kidding now  Pat  Let us know  It's a joke  Please be serious 
[03:14:30]  And say you're kidding  Okay  Thank you  That is really funny  Well their acting skills  Have gotten much better  They've gotten really good  We used to really be able  To pick you guys up  We can't see you  So we don't know  What you're doing  With your hands  So we can't figure out  If you're acting or not  All right  Every vegetarian  Is calling me wrong  Of course  But you know  That's the vegetarian  How can you be wrong  Look what you got  In front of you  Look what you got  I have a microphone  In front of me  My girlfriend  Is a vegetarian  So I know 
[03:15:00]  About vegetarians  I know about  Vegetarian lifestyle  I know what they eat  I know what  The whole deal is  Behind vegetarianism  But you know  It's not going to make  Me a vegetarian  I'm going to eat  A big kahuna burger  If I want  Every so often  I like a steak  Bless you  I love a steak  I'm ready for a steak  I would love one right now  Well done  Killed with a bat  But I'm just  I do understand  That it's fucking  I think it's barbaric  You have a moral  Little thing  A dilemma  Yeah  You know why  It's barbaric  Why  I'll explain to you  There's too many 
[03:15:30]  Fucking people to feed  You can't  You can't pet this thing  And give it a fucking  Injection  Like a friggin convict  Being put to death  Put them to sleep  And then carve them up  There is a process  There's an assembly line  That you gotta feed  Motherfuckers  And the only way  To do that  Is to run these things  On a conveyor belt  And slice their heads off  Or shoot a bolt  Through their head  At this point  We're ripe for  A nuclear explosion  Oh god 
[03:16:00]  Would I love it  We're so ripe  I want  Nuclear cataclysm  Like you couldn't believe  Just one or two  No I need  Complete devastation  Road warrior shit  I want road warrior shit  Because either I'm dead  Or I'm so fucking cool  I am dressing in leather  I'm putting a brace  On my leg  Even though it's fine  And I'm walking around  I'm sawing off shotguns  And I'm just being cool  I'm driving fast everywhere  I'm shooting people  That's what the future should be 
[03:16:30]  Post apocalyptic joy  Sorry  What  It's a minute distraction  No the weatherman  Was pointing  No the weatherman  Was pointing at stuff  And there was nothing  On the screen  Oh okay  Did you just point at  What a dope  Did you  Kind of  Jimmy did you point at  No no  We both looked at  The same thing  The guy was doing  All his weatherman  Pointing  But the screen behind him  Hadn't had the weather thing  So he was just pointing  At a fucking  Like a giant window shade  There was nothing  What is this cocksucker doing  That's pretty funny  Alright we should break  Hopefully he's pointing  To a place 
[03:17:00]  Where animals are just kissed  We can wrap up this break  Nicely by doing the gas story  That we kind of talked about  Oh good  Video of the day  Here's the story  You know he can't believe  He's alive  We're talking about  A Wisconsin police officer  His dashboard camera  Shows what happened  After a truck  Ruptured a gas main  The truck driver  Had run into  A home's utility room  The officer was able  To get the homeowners out  But when he tried  To rescue the truck driver 
[03:17:30]  Well he felt the blast  There probably isn't  A reason I probably  Should not be dead right now  After seeing the force  Of the explosion  I guess I'm just beside myself  Man the truck driver  Was killed  In that explosion  But God saved his life  Because God makes  Those choices every day  Yeah  For people  He's one of the  Good lord  It's not  It has nothing to do  With luck  Not at all  Not at all  God decided to save  That person  I just think  It's all predetermined 
[03:18:00]  Oh I don't know  About that  You don't have  Any say in the matter  We just  We are on a track  It's like that  Fucking autotopia  In Disney  Where you hope  You can turn  But you realize  At a very young age  You're just on a track  No one proves  Your theory wrong  Ah yeah  Plane crashes  Those are meant to be  All those people  Were meant to die  At the same time  Fuck yeah  They don't know each other  Then how do they get  All organized  To get on the plane  God is amazing like that  You don't think God  Could get a group of people 
[03:18:30]  Together like that  A few hundred people  In a tube  That's God  For God's sake  I don't think God cares  Like I think a lot of it's  Just random  And how you  You know  I don't think God  Actually planned out  Like alright well  Frank, Pete, and Ted  Are going to get on that plane  Bill will get stuck  I think God's busy  You think it's just  The big group thing  Yeah I think he's  Like ah  Flight 75  I think it's all random  I think it's all random  It's a crap shoot  Maybe you sit back  And you watch the whole thing  You create the mess  And you sit back  And you watch it  Cause you're God 
[03:19:00]  Why not  And you go  Look what I did now  Let's see how they  That's what I did  We're just a science experiment  Maybe  Let's see if they handle it  Any differently  Than they have  All the ones before  Nope  Same group comes up  Ropes it off  Investigates  This is boring  He's sitting there going  Boy this time  I thought the dinosaurs  Yeah  I thought they would last  Those dopes got stuck  In the tar pit again  God  This time I was rooting for them  Fuck  He must have enjoyed  The dinosaurs  Because they were around  A long ass time  60 million years

[03:20:30]  Behind him  And I shoot his tire out  Now he's crashed  On the side of the road  I get out  And he's like  Oh  Help me  Help  And I shoot him in the head  Because I'm so fucking  Devoid of emotion  At this point  Because  Everyone I've cared about  Was incinerated  In the nuclear cataclysm  Alright speed it up  So after you suck  The guy's cock  Then what do you do  Why do I suck a guy's cock  Because no one's looking  Okay what do I do  No wait

[03:26:30]  Was taking a dump  Was even taking a dump  Yeah cause they're  They're very stealth  Yeah  They really are  Stealth like  They sit quick  Holy crap  Get the girls calling  I'm telling ya  Something's going on  The girls have figured  This out a long time ago  They're stealth  With their shitting  Well girls are all  Just about business  They go in there  And get it done  They wake up in the middle of the night  Something's going on  I'm in there  First of all  I got my phone  Which gets TV  Yeah  So I will sit down  And watch like Fox News  Until my legs fall asleep 
[03:27:00]  And I got butt hickey  I get the red ring  Where the toilet seat is  Or I'll read  You know  Popular mechanics  And get on a good article  You know  A guy goes in there  And there's business going on  There's things happening  You're working  I imagine  You have very sloppy shits  No  With a lot of clean up  Where it's like  With the roll  You're sadly mistaken my friend  I bet you the answers are long  And they taper nicely  Long and raw 
[03:27:30]  And dark colored  Very nice  Yeah what color do you think  Like blood oranges  Dark thick shits  You do a lot  You do a lot of smoothies though  I'm thinking that  You know  Smoothies are good  They make it nice and smooth  It's smooth  It comes out like  Like a soft serve  You ever have one  Where it just falls out  A big block  I don't know what it is  Nah  There's the occasional one  But sometimes you sit down 
[03:28:00]  And it's not even  It just falls out  There's so many different varieties  It falls out in piddles  Piddles  I don't like milk duds  No no no  Like rabbit shit  But then there are some  Where you're like  Alright you gotta put the armor on  Cause you know you're going into battle  Before you even go  You put it off  Cause you just know  You're gonna go into battle here  And it's gonna be a chore  You're gonna have to get past that point  Where it works its way out  And then it's smooth sailing  Oh yeah 
[03:28:30]  But that one brick  Has to make its way through  And that's where you gotta do your battle  That's where you're pushing  Like you're a pregnant woman  And then you're breathing  Okay push  Push  It's crowning  It's crowning  I've actually had  The slide begins  I've had them where  All of a sudden you sit down  And it's like Saddam being hung  You move the trap door  And it's  Alright everything's all quiet 
[03:29:00]  Looks like fucking stew and placenta  We're throwing in the toilet  There is that unpleasantness  Of when you're not sure that's gonna happen  You feel a little gurgling  But there's that plug  That cork  I guess what was left over  From before you had  Fucking Dinty Moore  In your guts  And once that comes out  It's like you said 
[03:29:30]  The trap door  There's not even an order  It's like a fucking mob  Running out of a burning building  Scooby Parmy  Scooby Parmy  Scooby  Scooby Parmy  Scooby  They're all rushing into the coolness of the toilet  Scooby Parmy  Scooby Parmy  Scooby  People running out of a burning building  Yeah they're all just trying to escape  That's what I mean by the piddle shit  By the way  What kind of piddles  Piddle  Piddle  Piddle  Piddle  Nothing better than just 
[03:30:00]  Go in  The job's done  Perfectly even taper  Nice  Don't have to worry about  When it decides  I'm putting the brakes on right here  I'm stopping right here  You might be halfway through  I'm done  I jump up and down  Whatever you do  It just can't  It can't work  Knees bent  Just jump up and down  Jump up and down 
[03:30:30]  And then the ass  The ass actually  Loses communication with the brain  Your brain is going  You stay where you are  You stay  No don't clench  Don't  Oh you're clenched  Your ass is not made to cut those things in half  Nope  Nope  You gotta do a headstand after that  And ask your girlfriend to fish her fingers into your asshole  And finish the job  Do a little noodling in there  I've asked my girl many times  Pull that catfish shit out  Honey take that long nail and scoop it in there for me 
[03:31:00]  Would you be a doll  Would you be a doll  You're on fire  You show me you love me  You're such a mensch  You wanna help me out here  Just dig your nail about four inches into my colon  Scrape  Scrape the sides  Guys here we go  Ed in Philly  Ed what's up  Ed  Hey what's up fellas  Hey Ed  Hey I got some insight on how women take a shit  Okay  My wife tells me she holds it at work all day  And as soon as she gets done  She runs to the bathroom  She kind of swears to God  She's out of the bathroom  Less than 90 seconds  Oh so she holds it 
[03:31:30]  So she's really gotta go  Exactly  Yeah that's just uncomfortable though  Let's uh  Yeah  She must be pleasant to work with  Yeah  She's got a fucking log ready to make a jailbreak  And she's fucking  I have four more hours to go till I'm home  Yeah let's go to Josh in DC  We really wanna hear from the ladies  But uh we got Josh  Josh what's up  Well thanks a lot man  Um  No I uh  I used to date a girl  And when  She would take a dump  I would sit on the floor in the bathroom  And have a little chat  You sit on the floor and talk as she's dumping  Wow  Yeah why not 
[03:32:00]  It's a good time to catch up on the day  Do you have a rod  Where'd you find  Where'd you find this catch  Well she wasn't quite a catch  That's why we're no longer together  Who are you dating  Truman  Punching out  Goodbye  I heard he used to shit  And fucking  Make his secretary  Like his press secretary  Take notes  Just to be powerful  Really  Yeah yeah  As he was shitting  Truman  I think it was Truman  What a douche  I love that  He got dropped fucking two nukes  What does he need to feel powerful over  Before then obviously  Oh it was before  First it was dukes  Dude dukes 
[03:32:30]  And then nukes  A few bombs before that  Uh Samson in New Hampshire  What's up  Hey guys  Samson's a girl  No no no  I'm definitely a guy guys  But uh  I don't  Uh never mind  Alright hold on hold on hold on  Hold on for one sec  Matt in Queensbury  That's clench  And not clinch  Your asshole's not vying for a spot in the playoffs  My asshole clinched  You can clinch right  Isn't it both  Clinch and clinch  Clinch  Hold on I know clinch is 
[03:33:00]  But isn't clinch  I don't  I really don't know  Maybe clinch is too  Cause clinch is to grab  Cause clinch is to grab on  And to squeeze  And to hold  Or to something  Yeah  I believe to clinch your butt cheeks  You can clinch or clinch  Um  Than is looking it up right now  And I want an answer  I'm not gonna let this guy  Uh get to me  Oh golly gee  He was just going for a joke  That's all he was trying to do  No no  He was just going for a little chuckle  Actually  It was very funny  But not accurate  Uh  Than now has the microphone  Than please  Mannequins  Why would it work 
[03:33:30]  Oh  Oh  Yeah  That's me  Um  Okay  Used with object  To settle a matter decisively  Clinch  Uh  To secure  To secure  Okay  That could be  To facet  To fasten  Yeah  To secure  To clinch  It's a little different than clinch  If you clinch  You are securing  That piece of shit  Oh yes  Uh  Verb slang  To embrace passionately  Well  Maybe Jimmy  Now watch clench  The opposite of what I do 
[03:34:00]  Now watch clench say  To slam assholes shut  When log is coming out  Uh huh  I'm gonna  I'm gonna stay with clinch  Clench  And then clinch is to close tightly  Grasp firmly  That's clench  Oh  But  Under the definition  The third definition  It just says clinch  So clinch  One of the definitions of clinch  Is clinch  Is clinch  Yeah  It's different though  Thank you  To clinch is to clinch  But to clinch  Is not necessarily to clinch  Anyone will tell you that 
[03:34:30]  I understand  So I guess we're gonna have to  Agree to disagree  Let's just agree to disagree  All right  Uh Samson of New Hampshire  What's up  Hey guys  Um I just  Sometimes I get the ghost shit  You know what that is  It's when you just  Take a dump  And all of a sudden  You like look around  And see how big it was  And you're like  Oh my goodness  Where'd it go  Where'd it go  It just kind of slides down the bowl  I love when they do that  It's a heavy one  That's all it is  It understands its place  And just leaves  Don't you love when it slides  And it kind of pokes halfway out  It's so ready to be flushed away  Like a good duty 
[03:35:00]  And then when you wipe  And you're like  There's nothing there  And you're like  Oh I'm gonna have a great day  What the hell is in the middle  Of a floater by the way  Just a lot of air  Probably just um  Yeah I think it's very porous  Uh yeah I think so  Or helium  I eat balloons  Helium  You guys want to get really gross  Yep  We're already there  Not yet  Jason the trucker  Go ahead Jason  Morning boys  Good morning Jason  Hey I was with my chick  A couple days ago  And she's never  She's never had anal sex before  So  You know I've kind of  Talked her into doing it
