<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The final Opie and Anthony Show of 2007 was a raucous affair, beginning with in-studio guests Drew Boogie, Patrice O'Neal, and a later appearance by Chris Rock.  The hosts, consumed by anxieties over past controversies like the "voyeur bus" incident and near-firings, recounted a chaotic station Christmas party filled with drunken employees, disastrous karaoke (particularly Tom's performance, later played for the audience), and the lingering smell of a homeless man, Tippy Tom.  They showcased (and discussed the YouTube availability of) a "Money Honey" segment featuring naked women rolling in $2,500.

A significant portion of the show involved an online Call of Duty session with Than and Travis, during which Opie lamented his Xbox controller compared to his preferred mouse and keyboard.  This transitioned into a debate about racial slurs, particularly the n-word, and Chris Rock's influence on its usage.  The broadcast also touched upon movie reviews (*Sweeney Todd*, *Walk Hard*, *Charlie Wilson's War*, and others), a listener's upcoming LASIK surgery, and a news story about a man turning blue from colloidal silver.  An attempt at a year-end top ten quotes countdown fell flat due to missing audio and lackluster selections.

The "top quotes of 2007" segment generated considerable discussion, featuring derisive commentary on Miss Teen USA South Carolina's quote about education and settling on "Don't tase me, bro" as the top quote.  The surprising absence of Black people in the top quotes led to a conversation on racial stereotypes and perceptions, further fueled by listener calls and Patrice O'Neal's contributions.  This segment included a lengthy, often offensive, bit about a hypothetical attack by a Black man, filled with racist jokes and generalizations.  The "Money Honey" video was revisited, along with discussions about K-Rock DJ E-Rock's alleged Paltalk antics, and other O&A quotes like "Picture your grandma naked" and "Space shovel endeavor."

Chris Rock's arrival brought a shift in focus to Patrice O'Neal's career, with both Chris Rock and the hosts offering a critical yet affectionate assessment of Patrice. They jokingly staged an intervention for him.  The conversation delved into the hardships of early comedian life, including shared living situations and class-based catering differences in comedy clubs.  Chris Rock shared anecdotes from his career, including his Oscars hosting and experiences in India. The hosts repeatedly discussed the "Two Girls, One Cup" video, eliciting a strong reaction from Chris Rock.  Further topics included fame disparity ("black fame" vs. "white fame"), other comedians (Tracy Morgan, Chris Farley), and Chris Rock's New Year's Eve show.  Listener calls, a plug for Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier's podcast, and a caller fundraising for an animal shelter rounded out this segment.

A substantial portion was dedicated to explicit discussions of sex and sexual encounters, with Patrice O'Neal recounting a hitchhiking experience and a detailed threesome.  The hosts and Patrice analyzed a video featuring oral sex and defecation, discussing various sexual preferences and fetishes in graphic detail.  A surprise call from Vince McMahon, jokingly firing Opie and Anthony and promoting WWE's "Tribute to the Troops," provided a humorous contrast.  E-Rock was mentioned as being present in the studio.

A subsequent segment featured another Vince McMahon call, this time centered on a fabricated news story about his "demise."  They discussed wrestling, past collaborations, and the upcoming Royal Rumble.  The segment then shifted to listener calls about relationship issues, with Patrice O'Neal offering blunt and sexually explicit advice.  Discussions involving "Flea," "Stalker Patty," and additional listener calls continued, punctuated by crude jokes, sexual innuendo, offensive stereotypes, Jim Norton show ticket giveaways, Patrice O'Neal promoting his shows, and a brief musical interlude before the hosts signed off for their vacation. Sam was also mentioned as assisting with a surprise call.

[00:06:30]  Yee  And I'd hear  What  What  And then my head  I'm going  Oh  Oh no  Oh no  She heard it  I tried to say it low enough  Of course she heard it  Women  Their ears are trained  To hear that word  From miles away  You know how like  The whales  Yeah yeah  They hear each other  From what  Hundreds and hundreds  Of miles away  In the ocean  When it comes to that word  They have super hearing  Yeah  Super hearing

[00:19:30]  So we could all talk  To each other  It's like hey  Hey there's Than  And Travis  And then we get into  On these maps  And go in  And go into battle  We were a band of brothers  Last night  With our  Illustrious  Colonel  Than  Colonel  You're a colonel  He's now a full bird colonel  Oh yeah  Which upsets me  Because I was  Really going up  In rank quickly  On my PC  But then I had to play 
[00:20:00]  The Xbox version  Of Call of Duty  And back to private  And now I'm up to  Sergeant again  But I still have problems  With that controller  Like I'm just getting  To the point where  I can walk through a door  Without looking hysterical  To the person  That's shooting me  Bouncing into the door jam  Bonk  Bonk  Bonk  I can't get through  Doorways  Up the stairs  Or I walk up the stairs  And you know how  You ever see a good TV show  Where the guy's walking upstairs  With the gun  And he knows exactly  How to look around 
[00:20:30]  Sure  While you're walking upstairs  I'm looking at my feet  And wondering why  I just got blown up  With a grenade  I can't figure out  That god damn controller  I just gotta practice  More with it  But  Well cause you use  Your keyboard  Mouse and keyboard  Forever  For years  Since Doom  Since the original Doom  Came out  I was using mouse and keyboard  Like you're using keys and stuff  No  The keyboard  I find very easy  If you just use your computer  And you're clicking on things  You go into a folder  It's very smooth and fluid 
[00:21:00]  With the mouse  But the mouse  Is always the time  You have to move the mouse back  Like when the mouse  Goes to the wrong part of the page  You have to like  You're circling the mouse  In a small circle  And you have to jerk it  All the way up  And then back down  It's not quite that hard  With a game  Do you know what I mean?  To move the mouse  Nah  It's what you're used to really  Because you see those kids  Working like the Xbox  You know controllers  Oh I know  And they make it look like  They're like  Solving a Rubik's Cube  How they work that thing  Well those are the people  That eliminate me  In no time  Oh yeah  Because I'm there  Just trying to aim  I could come up on somebody 
[00:21:30]  With their back to me  Walk up to them  And start firing  And completely surround him  In bullets  As he slowly turns around  And one shots me in the head  Yeah you create one of those  Little cartoon outlines  Of bullets around  Yeah around him perfectly  Missing with every shot  He turns around  Oh look at this idiot  And in the middle of me  Reloading  Boom  Headshot  I'm dead  I have gotten better  With the controller  I'll say that  Yeah  But nowhere near  What I can do 
[00:22:00]  With a mouse and keyboard  But  Are you bringing  Your gaming system  To Colorado  For the break?  No  I will bring a laptop  But I know  I can't be playing Xbox  Iraq is suggesting  I think it's a great idea  You guys need to record  The conversations  That is some fun stuff  Now that we should do  You really should  I mean because it's  A bunch of you guys  From the radio show  I think the listeners  Would love to hear you guys  Try to figure it out  We'll do that  Because last night  Was kind of fun  We got in this map  It's  What's the name of it?  Shipment 
[00:22:30]  Shipment  It's just this very small  It is very tiny  And it's just got like  Shipping  Containers  Containers  And some dumpsters  And stuff in it  And a hell of a lot of people  On both teams  And we were just  Getting our asses  Handed to us  Nothing but grenades  Flying at you  And gunfire  No matter where you were  I tried everything  And was just  You'd respawn  Voop  Just dead again  And airstrikes 
[00:23:00]  Constantly  I don't know who was doing it  But the other team  Was able to just  Call in airstrikes at will  And you're just blowing up  And there was nothing  We could do about it  And poor little private Travis  Running around the field  Just willy nilly  Getting killed  With your stock weapon  I seem to remember  Having a higher score  Than you on that  On that one  Did you?  Yes  Where did you hide?  Because I was out there  In the action my friend  Wait I'm confused  I didn't realize  They gave weapons to nurses  In Call of Duty 4 
[00:23:30]  Oh yeah  You should have been  Back at the hospital  Taking care of  The wounded troops  Is there an option  For that?  Bandages?  This is a crazy game  If the nurses have weapons  The medics  Yeah  You should be at the  USO place  Dancing with the boys  You should be  Baking brownies  For the boys  When they get back  To the base  So they have something  That we can do  Wonderful to eat  Did you give your nylons  For the war effort?  Is there a button for that?  Travis the Riveter  He goes 
[00:24:00]  I did better than you  Travis the Riveter  Alright we gotta take a break  Of course  Yeah  It took us  15 minutes  To warm up  Now we're on a roll  And we gotta take  Our first break  Yeah  It happens  Well Than  Between the company party  And the video game  Boy you had a night  Yeah  It was  You would have had fun  There was a great moment  At the Christmas party  I told you guys  In the office  But I wanted to tell  The listeners  So it's  Picture a table  It's Tom 
[00:24:30]  The big boss  Here in New York  Than and me  We're all kind of  Just talking  Yeah  And I was  I had a glass of wine  And we all like  Did a little cheer  Happy holidays  Toast nice  And right at that point  I'm thinking  You know  This would be a really good  Time to tell Tom  How good of a job  Than does for the radio show  Right  And as I  Than even saw  That something was about to happen  Because I'm turning  With my wine  Oh boy  I'm about to like  Compliment Than  Right in front of the big guy  That would be huge 
[00:25:00]  For someone like Than  For us it's like  Whatever  We're so jaded  Right  So  For a nobody like him  For a nobody like Than  That's fighting his way  To mediocrity  He's a colonel  For Christ's sake  Right  That's Chappie Sinclair  You're talking to  Chappie  Play the tape  Climb high  As I'm ready to do this  For Than  You know  And tell Tom  How great he's doing  Tom turns around  To talk to somebody else  And I had to tell Than  What just went on there  I'm like Than  Oh Mr. Spot  You know where Tom  Just turned his head  That was the moment  I was going to like 
[00:25:30]  Compliment you in front of Tom  I had to point it out  That's where the road  Forks to two different destinies  And then I go  And then I go  And look  Let's be honest with each other  That  That's  It was a moment that passed  And I don't think  It's going to happen now  We can't  We can't like  Manufacture that moment again  That was it  That was it  And it did not happen  Well then again  You are on a  National radio show  You could just go ahead  And do it now  Oh yeah  That's true  Now it just seems silly  Yeah  No  Tom's not listening today 
[00:26:00]  He's got to be hung over  From all that karaoke  Oh hey  That's cool  I'll just email him a clip  What about the job  Hot Lips Travis does  He wasn't at the party  I was helping out  The guys that were at the party  I think that we should  We should have a  Take a break  No we'll take that break  But I think that Stan and Tom  Maybe we could make that happen  If Tom comes in  I think it should happen  No Tom wants his 50 bucks 
[00:26:30]  From the Van Halen  He hasn't given up on that  We'll talk about that  After the break  Wow  Boy did Kenny give me an earful  On the way in today  Oh let me tell you  Kenny just can't wait  To give you the latest gossip  Of course  The latest dirt on everybody  Every morning  I jump in his truck  And the latest gossip  Did you hear  You know Tom really  Wants his money  When you open the door  You can hear it  You'll hear like  And I told him  He starts as you're getting in 
[00:27:00]  Oh my god  And by the time  Kenny sees me every morning  I'm awake for officially 15 minutes  Yeah  Because I've talked about it  Alarm goes off  It's like a NASCAR pit crew  And I'm out the door  In 15 minutes  Showered  Yeah you gotta get out of there  Teeth brushed  You know  And so when I see him  And he's just yapping  Right off the bat  Because he's been driving  For the last half hour  Just thinking about  What he wants to say  Gearing up  What his opening line  Is gonna be  When he sees me  You think he just  Talks to himself  Like  Oh that's a good one 
[00:27:30]  Oh you're tragic  That's good  He'll enjoy this story  Well he's also  Beating himself up today  Because he didn't go  To the Christmas party  And do some networking  I should've been there  Why didn't he  With GH  I could've done  Some networking  I'm like  No you couldn't  See him  He gets really drunk  And he tries to kiss  One of the salesmen  Like at the end  Of American Beauty  He puts his hand  In the back  Of one of the salesmen's  Heads  And just goes in  For a deep kiss  While the  Jessica Berg's song 
[00:28:00]  Is playing  Yeah  Alright we gotta  Take our first break  Also in studio  Don't forget  Chris Rock at 8  Patrice O'Neill  In about a half hour  Drew Boogie live  And he'll take us to break  On the O.B. and Anthony show  Damn  You just been  Home  You just  You just  You just been  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home 
[00:28:30]  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  Home  I gotta love that. 
[00:29:00]  Drew Boogie live in studio today.  It's the Opie and Anthony show the day before we take a little bit of a break.  The last show of 2007, a little holiday recuperation.  Yeah, we're not going to be able to promote it, but let's not forget that Jim Norton's  going to be at the North Fork Theater out there on Long Island for New Year's.  Anthony's going, I'm going. 
[00:29:30]  Pretty much, I think the whole show's going, Jimmy.  We're spending our New Year's.  Yeah, absolutely.  I have one more prize package, two more to give away, so I'll do it if you call up.  You get, I guess, two free tickets, and you get a free VIP parking pass and a free backstage  pass to come say hello, and afterwards we're going to go to FH Riley's and eat, and you  get nothing free there except perhaps the privilege of talking to all three of us.  That's the price right there.  I was talking to my brother last night.  I think he's going to throw a little beer special or something at everybody that shows up, sure. 
[00:30:00]  Good.  So come, because the show's done by like 10 o'clock, so it'd be cool to go over there  and like, what are you going to do, drive in the city and like get loaded and drive home  just like stay in Long Island?  So you're definitely going to be there?  We'll ring in the New Year together.  Yeah.  Ring it in.  My brother is very excited because you haven't been there in a long time.  No.  No, but it'll be fun to go over there because I don't want to drive into New York until  after midnight.  Right, right.  I just don't want to deal with it going into the tunnel and stuff like that.  So just call up now, and here's the password to get your free tickets.  The first two callers get this. 
[00:30:30]  Mumia Abu-Jamal should be executed.  Uh-huh.  I know that's not fun in very New York games.  I'm like, however.  What a downer.  Just say that.  I mean, I don't disagree, but what a downer, man.  That's not a very good one.  How about I love eggnog or something?  I know.  I should have kept it in there.  Wow.  You're right.  Let me leave you on that.  Mumia Abu-Jamal should be executed.  Ho, ho, ho.  Ho, ho, ho.  So come to the show if you want, and then come over to FH Riley's Afterward, and we'll  hang out.  Yeah, that's my brother's joy at 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village. 
[00:31:00]  But you brought that up.  What are you talking about there, Jimmy?  Just a brief.  You're on to something.  I only wanted to mention this, because it's a really nice article I read by Maureen Faulkner,  whose husband, Danny Faulkner, was the cop shot and murdered by Mumia.  And again, I don't know everything about this case, so people may call up and yell at me.  Go ahead.  But she has a book out, and I just wanted to plug it for her.  Murdered by Mumia, a life sentence of lost pain and injustice, and all the proceeds go  to a...  Free Mumia?  Yes, to free Mumia, and for Mumia Halloween costume masks. 
[00:31:30]  It looks like Predator with that stupid hair.  And all the proceeds go to children whose parents have been murdered.  All right, very good.  Good luck to her with that book.  All right, in other things, a lot of great movies starting this weekend.  Sweeney Todd getting 87% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  Can that Johnny Depp make a bomb already?  Yeah, we talked about it.  Can he just make a bomb, please?  I mean, give him a few...  I'm jealous.  Give him a few early in his career, but the last 10 to 15 years, I don't think there's  a bomb in there. 
[00:32:00]  My girlfriend won't admit to wanting to have sex with people.  Like, you know, they don't ever want to give you that ammo.  So we were talking, I'm like, well, if you had to, like, with an actor, like, who would?  She's like, I don't know.  Johnny Depp.  Johnny, I'm like, you bang him?  Yeah.  Like, she wants to bang him so bad, she can't even, like, do the girlfriend denial.  Like, oh, no, I'd tell him I had a boyfriend.  Shut up, you wouldn't.  She'd probably tell him I had a boyfriend and get an autograph as he was railing her.  He'd have the paper on her back.  Jimmy, following that, I love the couples out there that...  We talked about this on the show before, but the couples that go, 
[00:32:30]  Oh, we both have one.  Yes.  We both have one.  And the woman will go, yeah, I'm allowed to bang Brad Pitt and there would be no problems  at home.  And he's got one, too.  His is Jessica Biel.  Yeah.  Like, this fat housewife from freaking Long Island is ever going to get the chance to  bang Brad Pitt.  What she doesn't realize is mine is Brad Pitt and his is my sister and my friends.  Right, right, right.  That would be...  That's the bit right there, yeah.  All right, look, you get together with your wife or girlfriend. 
[00:33:00]  All right, hey, why don't we make a pact that we both get one.  One person we're allowed to have sex with and it doesn't lead to a divorce or any of that  crap.  And then let her go first.  Let her get some Hollywood unobtainable guy.  All right, I'm glad you brought this up.  Mine's Brad Pitt.  Well, mine's your sister.  The neighbor.  The neighbor, right.  A hooker.  Right, right.  Something you can go out with right after the conversation and just have sex with.  Yeah, I've brought it as friends.  Mine's the desperate housewife at the end of the cul-de-sac. 
[00:33:30]  How great is Johnny Depp, man?  The guy, Tim Burton, he's directing Sweeney Todd.  It just looks like really...  Tim Burton's brilliant, man.  I love Tim Burton's movies, man.  Everything's tall and thin.  It just looks interesting.  Wow.  And very dark, too.  Yeah, he loves that darkness.  He's a creep.  Yeah, but he is.  Yeah, absolutely.  Then you got Walk Hard.  We had J.C. Reilly in studio right on that couch a mere few days ago.  Now he's a big star today.  J.C. Reilly.  John C.  What did I say?  J.C. Reilly? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, well, that is technically correct.  I was just like, wait a minute.  That didn't sound right.  Yeah, John C. Reilly.  I'm sorry.  That's what his buddies call him.  Right.  He's our buddy now.  Hey, I went to the Christmas party instead of going to bed early.  Yeah, John C. Reilly.  He was just sitting right there while his movie's getting 80% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  The only place to go for movie reviews, by the way.  Brother Weiss turned me off to that site years ago.  And then you got Charlie Wilson's War, 75% positive reviews.  And then it gets bad. 
[00:34:30]  Then you got National Treasure, Book of Secrets, only 36% good reviews.  And then P.S. I Love You.  What the F is that movie about?  Does anyone know?  It's getting 13% positive reviews.  What's the No Country for Old Men?  That's good?  Oh, my God.  Everyone says that's like the movie of the year.  Got to see that one.  My lady friend wants to see it.  Your lady friend.  Hey, can I go?  I'm going to get my LASIK today from One Vision.  They're doing my surgery.  I'm a little nervous.  Good luck.  Yeah, yeah.  You really should be.  Plead faith.  Oh. 
[00:35:00]  I know.  Oh, you know what I mean?  My visual works so well.  I'll see myself in the mirror and blow my brains off.  Yeah, Matt, it works too well.  That's hilarious.  I'm like, God, you're uglier than your thoughts.  God, I thought I was a five.  I'm actually a three and a half.  There's a decimal point before me.  Right.  Am I able to, I know you got to take, I'm taking tonight off, but is there a way after  LASIK surgery to go to a movie like later that night or is it not, should you just,  what time are you getting it?  Your retinas will burn.  What time are you getting it done?  I go over, I leave IXM at like 10, I have a 10.30 appointment. 
[00:35:30]  So they said at 12.30?  Yeah, later movie, you'll be all right.  Okay.  Really later.  Really later?  I'm trying to remember because I had mine done back in the day with Diamond Vision and  took a little nap and I woke up like an hour and a half, two hours later and I was seeing  2015.  It was amazing.  Yeah, they told me that you're absolutely amazing.  You kind of relax, you sleep for a little bit, you wake up.  No, just take it easy for the first night or two.  When you open your eyes for the first time without contacts or glasses and the stuff you  see, you're like a newborn kid or something.  I don't know.  You start seeing everything completely different. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, you only need a few hours to heal and then after that, you're good to go.  Yeah.  It's not even healing.  It's the drugs they use to kind of freeze your eyeballs in place so they're not focusing  in and out through the surgery.  Yeah.  When that wears off, you're ready to go.  A couple hours.  Certain things I don't want you doing, like no steam room for like a week or two because  they said like little things that can wrinkle.  Oh my God, that's going to kill you, Jimmy.  I don't mind.  I can get laid out of places.  So I'm actually looking forward to it. 
[00:36:30]  I have a feeling you love steam rooms.  I went yesterday for the first time in a long time.  I love a good steam room.  I dropped the ball on that one, sorry.  No, I dropped it first because I was supposed to say I have a feeling you like steam rooms  and you go, oh boy.  All right.  Let both of our heads itch and we'll regroup.  I hope right now Tom is vomiting.  I bet you right now Tom is nude except he has his tie on.  It's a gentleman's way to vomit with a tie on.  I hope he's trying to figure out how to get a dead hooker out of his hotel room. 
[00:37:00]  I guess he had a mishap last night.  Oh God, this is going to ruin me.  Look at the man on the news.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  There's a man on the news.  He's a big fan of the radio show, that guy.  That's our...  I met him at Dennis Leary and Friends.  He's the weather guy for Channel 7 here in New York.  He's a huge fan of the show.  Bill Evans.  Bill Evans.  Bill Evans are a good thing.  But he has a Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer nose on top.  Oh, it is the holiday time.  That's lighting up.  Well, thank you, Bill, and we appreciate that very much.  And I'd like you to remove that with a sharp stick. 
[00:37:30]  If you're a fan of the show, you can appreciate that, right, Bill?  That's right.  Hey, this is an amazing story, and we should link the pictures of this guy on onaradio.com later today.  You heard about the guy whose face turned blue?  Yeah, like a bluish-gray color.  I read about this.  I'm like, yeah, whatever.  But then they showed the guy on the news today.  He looks like he's ready to perform in the Blue Man Group.  Yeah, I thought he did.  I thought he had makeup on, but apparently it's his skin pigment. 
[00:38:00]  What happened?  Some kind of medical mishap?  Yeah, they were trying to.  He thought that they wanted to be more for the blueberry, but only because of the antioxidants,  and instead they did the coloring.  Nothing.  All right, okay.  Swing and a miss.  Good try, fat boy.  Nice try, blubberneck.  Here we go.  Man's skin turns blue.  With this next story, you don't need to try to adjust your television set. 
[00:38:30]  What you're saying really is true.  This man's skin color really is blue.  He's 57-year-old Paul Karrison.  His skin started turning blue 14 years ago.  That's about the same time he began drinking collodial silver, made by extracting silver  from metal into water with an electrical current.  It is billed as a cure-all for everything that ails you.  Karrison swears by it.  Well, this guy's having a real tough time.  Yeah.  We should bring him in to read the news with Big A. 
[00:39:00]  Wait, is he the guy who swears by it?  The manufacturer?  No, I think the guy that takes it.  I don't know.  I've never heard of this thing before.  He swears at it now when he looks in the mirror.  Yeah, no kidding.  The guy is a grayish-blue color.  It doesn't look very healthy.  That doesn't sound healthy.  No, not at all.  Drinking silver?  To cure everything.  Know how it cures everything, by the way?  It kills you, and then you don't have anything to worry about.  Then you don't have anything.  He says the change in his skin color actually occurred very slowly. 
[00:39:30]  But twice it was just so gradual that no one really noticed.  It wasn't until a friend that I hadn't seen in several months came by to my parents' place to see me.  And he asked me, well, what did you do?  Well, Harrison doesn't think drinking the potion turned him blue.  He thinks it started when he rubbed it on his face to treat a skin problem.  Well, he moved to the Fresno area six months ago from Oregon, and he says he is just looking for acceptance. 
[00:40:00]  It never goes away?  It never goes away?  I don't know.  Why don't you stop?  I don't know.  Why don't they report these things better?  Yeah, why don't they report these things better?  Lay off the stupid dog or wolf going into a restaurant in Italy, and give us a little more on that.  Well, maybe Travis knows.  Yeah, no, it doesn't go away.  And he knows that he wasn't supposed to rub it on his skin, but he did it anyway. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, wait, so he did something?  I thought you were supposed to drink this stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's doing that.  Why would he rub it on his skin?  Because he had some kind of a skin thing that he wanted to get rid of.  Skin issue, and he wanted to get rid of it.  So he rubbed it on his skin, even though the company tells you not to do that, and he  keeps doing it to this day.  Oh, wait, it wasn't a one-time skin rub.  No.  It's a long, over the...  I think this guy has mental problems.  He's obsessed with the product.  I think he's obsessed with the product, like Jimmy said, and I think he started turning 
[00:41:00]  blue and went, this is my thing.  I'm going to be blue guy.  Is that him before he's blue?  Yeah.  And now he's got this really...  His beard is even creepy.  He's got the fullest beard I've ever seen.  Santa Claus beard, and the contrast is amazing.  And an extremely blue face.  He looks like one big blueberry.  He looks sad.  Yeah.  He's blueberry, man.  Bloobery.  All right.  He ate the stick of gum at Willy Wonka.  I was trying to remember why...  Yes.  Violet, right? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  You nailed it.  All right.  Violet?  No, I don't know.  We've got to play a little catch-up.  When we get back, we're going to do the top ten quotes of the year.  With Patrice.  And Patrice is going to be...  That's why I want to take a break early.  Oh, yeah.  So we get Patrice in here.  He's been standing by for the last ten minutes.  He's here?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So we'll take a quick break.  Patrice O'Neal is going to join the program.  And let's not forget, at 8 o'clock, Chris Rock.  Mm-hmm.  And we've got Drew Boogie live, and this is what he does for you guys today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll be right back. 
[00:42:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:42:30]  Ah!  Wow. 
[00:43:00]  That's cool.  That's the audio from when E-Rock spanked that girl really, really hard and left a major  handprint.  Ah!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  He's going to be at Comic, C-O-M-I-X, here in New York City tonight and tomorrow night.  Shows at 8.30 and 10.45 both nights.  Oh, no.  No, no, it's next week.  Next week.  Next Friday, Saturday.  Oh, my.  And why are you here?  Because you're going to be gone. 
[00:43:30]  What am I going to do, plug it over your phone?  Look how I just saved my ass.  Yeah, it's next Friday, Saturday.  I'm sitting there.  I'm sitting there.  I'm sitting there.  I'm sitting there.  I'm sitting there.  I'm sitting there on you because I can't read right.  Yeah.  It's 8.30 and 10.45 both nights.  Next Friday and Saturday.  Tonight, I'll be packed for Fred McGillicuddy, whoever's there tonight.  All right, next Friday and Saturday.  I love Fred McGillicuddy's stuff.  Terrific.  Two impersonations.  You think it was there?  Yeah.  Two shows both nights. 
[00:44:00]  For info, 212-524-2500.  To book in advance.  How about that?  Comics is located at West 14th Street there on 9th Avenue.  14th and 9th, basically, here in New York City.  It's a great club, and Patrice is a great comic, so I would recommend you go check it  out.  Thank you.  All right.  See you guys later.  Click done.  Now get out!  Get the hell out of here.  I haven't seen my baby Norton in a while.  I know.  Little Jim. 
[00:44:30]  I don't like him.  I miss him.  You like his glasses?  He's gorgeous with his big eyes just all bugging out.  Just say it dullish.  They're dullish.  Yeah.  Norton just kills me.  He just looks like somebody you just want to rob every time you see him, but he just  such a tough little mom.  He's having his eyes done.  Yeah, he's having LASIK.  My girl had that.  It works.  You'll be feeling like another person.  I told Patrice how funny it would be if his girl got LASIK, and then the day after he  came home and all of her stuff was out of his apartment.  She finally can see.  I would step on her contact lenses and do it. 
[00:45:00]  You guys want to do some of the memorable quotes of 2007?  Oh, why wouldn't we?  Most end-of-year lists suck, but this one's all right.  I mean, some of the crazy things that have been said in the past year.  We could do the top five.  Oh, could we do ten?  Well, we could do the top three hundred.  How about this?  We could do number six.  We could do number five. 
[00:45:30]  We could do number three, number two, number one.  We're missing number four, and we're missing seven through ten.  Can't find the quotes anymore, audio-wise.  Oh, audio-wise.  Okay.  Maybe because they were in print.  All right.  I didn't think we were doing audio.  That's great.  That makes it better.  We can't play the audio for it?  For some of these, we can.  Others were in print.  That's why.  Or we'd have all ten, I guess.  I mean, if you want, Jimmy, you want to start with number ten there on the list?  Okay.  Ow.  Ten. 
[00:46:00]  I think as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world, this administration  has been the worst in history.  Who do you think said that, Patrice O'Neill?  It's one of the top quotes of 2007.  Number ten.  Who do you think said that?  Oh, boy.  What's the guy that does radio?  Al, the guy that does radio, he was on Trading Places.  Al Franken.  Al Franken says.  Al Franken.  I don't know.  I took a test.  He had one line in Trading Places. 
[00:46:30]  He was in the very last scene with the gorilla.  That was Al Franken.  He had a walk on.  Right.  No, I'll say this.  It's a former president.  Ooh.  Oh.  Jimmy Carter.  Ah, see, that hint.  That was an unfair hint.  Why?  There's only four left.  I figured, if you went from Al Franken, I had to get a close.  Yeah.  I had to pull us in.  We can't do this all day.  This is supposed to be ten quick minutes there, Patrice.  This next one would have been Richard Pryor.  Right.  Richard Pryor said it.  George Carlin moving slowly toward President Carter. 
[00:47:00]  Jimmy, all right, it's going well so far.  Number nine.  I think so.  People always tell me I'm a hit on the quotes.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Number nine.  I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who's articulate and bright and clean  and a nice-looking guy.  I mean, that's a storybook, man.  Rush Limbaugh.  No.  No, no.  It's another candidate, I believe, right?  Yeah.  Very good.  Very good.  It is.  The quote is, I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright 
[00:47:30]  and clean and a nice-looking guy.  I mean, that's a storybook, man.  Man.  The guy from Die Hard 2 that played the boss in Die Hard 2.  Okay.  Name?  Fred Thompson.  Yes.  It was him.  Oh, I think you're kidding.  No.  No.  I think you're joking about it, just like Hans Gruber.  It's Hans Gruber, the FBI.  Fred Thompson.  No, it's... 
[00:48:00]  Come on, just stop Biden's time.  What's that guy?  I think man was the hint, right?  The big hint, man.  No, that was just...  I just thought it was the quote.  Oh, I thought you were saying that.  Ron Paul.  You're just Biden your time, and there's no reason for it.  Paul R. Nelson.  He said Biden your time.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Joe Biden your time.  I thought his water had to hit him.  Oh, what an ass.  Oh, my God.  Didn't even get that hint.  He's just Biden his time.  All right.  All right, let's go.  I thought he was just...  I thought Jimmy was just being an idiot. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  I was like, why is he saying that twice?  It's a tough one.  Top quotes of 2007.  Number eight there, Jimmy.  These are the top quotes in terms of popularity?  Or the ones you...  You're right.  Yeah, you know.  It doesn't mean anything, really.  Yeah.  No.  I have a wide stance when going to the bathroom.  Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  We all know who that is.  Yeah, Larry Craig, of course.  Number seven.  I'm not going to get into a name-calling match with somebody who has a 9% approval rating. 
[00:49:00]  I know who that is.  That's your girl.  Who?  Your homegirl, the big girl.  Condoleezza?  No, the white woman that called the other guy a sissy.  Oh.  Oh, Ann Calder?  Yes.  No, I do love her for that.  Oh.  All right.  This is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid trashing Dick Cheney.  That's a quote.  What are these quotes?  That stinks.  I know.  Who knows these?  Where are the good quotes? 
[00:49:30]  I thought that was Ann Calder talking about getting into a battle with that dude, John Edwards.  That is a quotable quote.  You're right.  All right.  Well, here's number six.  Number six we got audio for.  Hopefully, it'll help the bit.  Okay.  So far, let's be very honest.  This bit is writhing and dying slowly.  These quotes stink.  What happened to Where's the Beef?  We got some of those Where's the Beef moments coming up.  Jesus.  Rudy Giuliani.  I mean, think about it.  Rudy Giuliani. 
[00:50:00]  There's only three things he mentioned in a sentence.  A noun and a verb in 9-11.  I mean, there's nothing else.  There's nothing else.  Jerry Seinfeld.  That's Joseph Biden.  Again.  Again.  Biden this time.  He's like the Beatles of quotes.  This guy doesn't stop.  He's having a good time.  He's like the Houston of quotes.  Joe Biden.  He's fantastic.  Here's number five.  I don't recall either.  I have no recollection of knowing when that occurred.  I don't recall the specific mention of this conversation. 
[00:50:30]  I don't recall Mr. Senator.  I don't recall any of this thing.  Wow.  I don't recall.  And I don't recall whether it was Mr. Mercer who presented me the number.  There are two that I do not recall knowing in my mind.  Boy, he doesn't recall a lot.  He rock.  Wow.  I don't recall.  Yeah, that's the I don't recall guy.  Former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez.  Repeated response to questioning at a congressional hearing about the firing of U.S. attorneys. 
[00:51:00]  Whew.  Number four you got, Jimmy.  Hopefully.  You sure it is in that different category?  Oh, well, number four is political.  Number four we do have audio for, and it's a where's the beef moment, but we can't play  the audio.  You're kidding.  We can't play that, right?  You're joking.  I don't know if we can.  We didn't check that already?  Did we check on that one?  Of course we can play that.  We don't have it, so I'm assuming we can't play it.  Do we know?  Oh, okay.  Then I know what number four is.  Do you know what number four is?  What we're referring to?  One of the top quotes of 2007, Patrice O'Neill.  Well, we have audio. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, of course.  We have audio of it, but we cannot play it.  What I say, what I'd be there to say, Donnie Imus.  Donnie Imus is number four.  The top quote of 2007.  The fact that that should be probably the number one or at least number two quote, only  because it was so, so overplayed.  I mean, who doesn't?  It changed.  People went on a racial tear after that.  Of course it was an important quote.  Yes.  This one should ring a bell.  Ring a little video. 
[00:52:00]  A little honeymoon is referenced.  Thank you.  All right.  Number three, top quotes of 2007.  Here we go.  In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country.  Probably my favorite of the year, by the way.  Then the students just openly laughing at the guy.  I will say the translator. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  No?  The Iranian president there that most people can't pronounce his name.  I'm a Dinanjan.  I'm a Dinanjan.  Yeah.  There you go.  So he made an ass of himself.  All right.  We're up to, wow, the runner-up quote of the year.  This is just exciting, huh?  I'm at the edge of my seat.  You are, right?  Yeah, because I just want to leave.  I'm bored.  No, no, no.  It's at the edge of my seat.  Right now in offices all over, they're probably pointing at each other.  No, I know what this first quote is going to be.  I know what it is.  We're stirring up some stuff here. 
[00:53:00]  For the people that are ready to turn the dial, you're going to be stupid because we're going  to come back strong with what I hold in my hand here.  That's all I'm going to say.  All right?  We have an office moment that we're going to be playing for everybody.  All right.  See, we've got to bring out the gold to save this segment.  Here's the top quote of 2007, the runner-up quote of 2007.  I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there 
[00:53:30]  in our nation don't have maps.  And I believe that our education, like such as in South Africa and the Iraq, everywhere  like such as.  And I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S.  or should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries.  So we will be able to build up our future for our job.  Thank you very much.  All right.  What a dope. 
[00:54:00]  How do you not just want to have really rough sex with that person?  Joke her out.  I want to bang the dumbness out of her.  Until she throws up with something stupid looking at her.  She's out of her mouth.  She's perfect.  Oh, she's dumb as they come.  Just give her the laundry to do and give her a grocery list.  She's perfect.  Walks in circles.  Dummy.  Wow.  That's what?  Miss South Carolina?  Miss Teen USA, South Carolina.  Yes.  How old is she?  Like 17 probably. 
[00:54:30]  Or 18.  Yeah, 18.  Or maybe 19.  I think I know number one.  You do?  I'm not crazy.  What do you think?  What?  I think I might have.  I think.  Or maybe some other list.  But the guy that goes, don't tase me, dude.  I swear to God.  That's number one on some list.  Don't tase me, dude.  Is like very high on some list.  I think it was bro.  Don't tase me, bro.  That's why I'm laughing at you.  Don't tase me, bro.  We're doing the top quote. 
[00:55:00]  You kind of got the keyword wrong.  Don't tase me, bro.  Is that it?  Don't tase me, dude.  Don't tase me, dude.  Don't tase me, champ.  Don't tase me, bro.  Don't tase me, pal.  Don't tase me, buddy.  Don't tase me, chief.  Don't tase me, guy.  You know, that quote.  Not one black person had a quote this year.  Good Jesus.  No.  No.  This is the white list.  Why do you have to make it a black-white thing every time?  Well, how about Asian?  Any quotes from anybody other than white people?  No, just white people make memorable quotes for some reason. 
[00:55:30]  We were on the media.  What can I tell you?  Oh, Ahmadinejad had a quote.  Evil dictator had a quote.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  Well, here's the number one quote of 2007.  You're a petty dictator, by the way.  I thought it was a good quote, too, by Bollinger.  Yeah.  Whatever the guy's name is.  Oh.  Here's the, believe me, I bombed internally as it came out.  Did you hear the confidence leaving?  Bollinger.  He said that like the girls had children.  I realized that I didn't know what I was, like, his name, but even if I did, it would 
[00:56:00]  have been a boring porn chart.  Now I'm boring slash stupid.  Enough.  Here's your top quote of 2007.  Don't chase me, bro.  Don't chase me.  There you go.  That's where you had it.  That's bigger than Imus, huh?  Wow.  Well, that's how we...  We tried to hide Imus in the middle of it.  Of course.  Yeah.  That's why these lists are stupid.  I'd say Imus should have been number...  What?  Oh.  Number three. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, freaking Drew Boogie's gonna do a little something with that.  Nice.  Off the cuff.  Look at that.  I just threw it at him.  That's how he works.  We'll see what he comes up with.  Are there any black quotes?  That's a good point.  There were no black people.  No black people.  They don't really say anything interesting.  Stick them up.  All right.  How about...  Stick them up.  Who says that anymore?  I ain't here to sell no books.  That couldn't have been up there.  Yeah, yeah.  Who said that?  Oprah.  Oprah.  I ain't here to sell no books.  I didn't hear that.  Oprah.  What?  I'm sure Michael Vick had a couple good quotes.  Says he's strangling a dog.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[00:57:00]  Somebody.  Come here, boy.  All right.  Just a whistle.  Oh.  You're giving me crap?  Have you watched your own video podcast, you creep?  Creep.  Talk it to the kitten like you do?  I love kittens.  Patrice O'Neal dot com for his video podcast.  They're terrific.  He did a little Michael Vick scoop, skit or whatever.  All right.  We're done with that.  That was...  Oh, please.  I think that was kind of interesting, though.  How can you tell when people out there just... 
[00:57:30]  I know you're reading these things, but how can you really tell?  Maybe people are going, hey, I want to know what the quote is.  Yeah, what is that quote?  Honestly, uh...  How do you know when it stinks?  Honestly, when you do, like, countdowns, even if it sucks, people have to stay tuned because  they just...  It's something inside of them.  Like, I just need to know what number one is.  And they don't even know why, but they just know they have to listen.  You've got to listen to hear what number one is.  It's an old radio trick.  Yeah, no, you probably...  We try not to break it out too often, but it does work. 
[00:58:00]  That's right.  What we should have done was...  We should have went, hey, number one after the break and make them sit through, you know,  commercials, but we're not going to do that today.  Let's go to Paul in Virginia.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Of course, Patrice, no black people have been any close to the year.  You just had two of them about y'all.  What just happened to me?  I don't know.  What happened?  Something happened to me just now.  I don't know.  You were saying that a couple of the quotes involved black people somehow, which was obviously  Imus' quote. 
[00:58:30]  And what was the other one, sir?  And Joseph Biden about how clean Obama was.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, white people's ridicule is counted as us making...  Yeah, what the hell?  White people's disgust of us counts as a quote we made?  Yeah, I don't think that counts.  Yeah, we learned that from you, Patrice.  I mean, come on.  Learned it from you, okay?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jared in Boston listening on BCN.  Jared, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I got a...  Patrice, I got a black man's quote for you.  Go ahead. 
[00:59:00]  Which way is north?  Linger, longer!  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's being suggested by a few people on Instant Feedback that we should say good morning to  all the people waking up from their comas.  Oh, wow.  Because they got knocked out sometime in the summer and they're finally waking up to Christmas  music.  We always talk about that in the summertime when you're walking around and some gentleman  might come up to you and ask you for the time or ask which way is north or just any question  on the street.  And as you turn to point or look at your watch, for a split second, you feel a little stinging. 
[00:59:30]  You hear a ring in your ears.  It's probably 90 degrees out on the streets of New York.  And then the next thing you know, you're slowly waking up and you hear a little Christmas  music.  No, I didn't set it up long enough to actually have a God effing Christmas song maybe queued  up.  I got it right here!  Oh, goody. 
[01:00:00]  A little Christmas music.  Yeah, which way is north?  Oh, well, let me see.  It's right.  Oh, well, what I, I'm just, wait a minute, it was just 90 degrees.  I was just getting my fireworks for the 4th of July.  Is that your Negro hitting you on the head with something, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Black people don't hit you.  What have you ever heard of somebody getting hit in the head with one of those blackjacks  and then you're in a coma?  It's a cobblestone. 
[01:00:30]  What do you watch, Kojak?  Seriously.  Where they chop you on your neck and you pass out?  This is not Hawaii Five-0.  No one does that.  It's usually a homeless guy.  Karate chop to the shoulder.  Right.  Hi-ya.  And you're sleeping.  And you go to sleep.  Well, let's hear it again.  Mr. Spock Pinch.  Look, you're a good Samaritan.  You're just trying to tell this fine gentleman which way is north.  It's the 4th of July around there, 4th of July weekend, and this is what happens.  Yeah, which way is north? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, well, let me see.  It's right.  And then just say again to the Christmas music because he's finally waking up from his coma.  He wakes up.  He looks out the window.  It's snowing out.  And he's like, wait a minute.  What?  It was just hot.  It was just 90 degrees.  You don't even know how awful you are.  This is implying.  Here he even adds to more white hysteria.  All right.  It's just arbitrary homeless black men will knock you out and put you in a coma now.  When are you going to stop? 
[01:01:30]  Hey, we're allowed.  You don't think that happens that people ask you a question to distract you and then punch you in the side of the head?  A homeless black man hitting you over the head?  Who said he's homeless?  I've never heard it.  No, I said homeless people.  Oh, he said homeless people.  No, he's talking about just black people don't hit you over your head and knock you out and take your money.  No, no, the sucker punch.  That's the sucker punch.  No one does that.  I've seen it on security videos.  Yeah.  You walk up.  You're saying hi, hello, and then some dopey idiot turns his head and points, and bam, the overhand right, right to the top of his head, and that guy is out until winter. 
[01:02:00]  I reject that.  That's a scene from Crash.  I reject that.  I just reject it.  I reject that because it was in a movie.  I'm starting to reject what white people say at every level.  It's just...  Good for you.  I don't hear about...  I don't hear it.  It's just our dumb bit, Patrice, and it's based on the fact that we get up very early, and we have to walk into the building, and there's some suspicious people around. 
[01:02:30]  And this one was...  There have been times I've walked in the middle of the street because, you know...  Let's be honest with people here.  Okay.  Let's just be honest with us.  When's the last time you walked in the middle of any street in New York City?  Very early in the morning on my way here.  It was probably a couple of years ago.  And even then, a homeless black dude almost robbed you.  No, no.  But there was something like I was...  You know, you get that instinct that goes, I shouldn't really be in close proximity to that guy. 
[01:03:00]  So I'm going to go out in the street when, you know, there's a couple of cars going and you can see me.  Have you ever had a close call in terms of somebody robbing you?  No, because I'm safe.  I have like a sixth sense.  Have you ever been mugged?  You rolled a blade through the streets with blue rays.  I had my black man incident when I was living in Buffalo.  I've told it many times.  I almost got raped by a black man.  That doesn't count because he thought you was a girl.  Right, true.  I had the long hair.  I'm constantly on guard, though.  They call me paranoid.  You have.  Well, I've had an armed robbery. 
[01:03:30]  I had a gun pointed at me and my girlfriend years ago in a McDonald's.  Black men?  All right.  Yeah, three of them had ski masks in August.  How do you know they were black?  Because they weren't wearing mittens.  What do you think they held the guns with?  In their pockets and implied them?  They didn't do the finger in the pocket?  Hey, Muggsy.  Yeah, they weren't wearing black mittens in July.  I know he was black because he put his hand in his pocket and said, stick him up, see?  See?  I can't believe that, man. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, that was kind of scary, man.  It's just we're grossly, we're just grossly misrepresented.  But we are more afraid of black people probably than we should be.  It only takes one black guy in a hoodie like an inch away from your face seeing if you're  a girl to make you a little scared of black people.  I have a question.  Yeah.  Just quickly.  How come we're not afraid of some, like, I should really theoretically be afraid of  some 25 to 35-year-old white guy that will arbitrarily shoot me and with other people.  Why aren't I looking at y'all with the same? 
[01:04:30]  Because they're few and far between and they shoot other white people.  Same thing with black people.  We shoot each other.  We shoot a bunch.  You should take it as a compliment.  But you guys are, you're scary to most white people.  I don't think we are anymore.  To most white people.  Because then the white guys would call up like, I ain't scared of no.  But in general, white people are scared of black guys.  It's just a fact.  I don't know why or where it comes from. 
[01:05:00]  Are you?  A little bit.  If I'm being honest.  What level?  What level?  Just a little bit.  Not to the paranoia state that this man has.  I just don't want a home invasion.  In a situation, what would scare you about a black guy?  Just in a situation.  Honestly, not many.  Not many.  I don't know.  Like, walking into the building when we do it quite early, every once in a while there's  people walking down the sidewalk.  I would say a gang of youths walking down the street and me walking up the street. 
[01:05:30]  That would scare me.  Mardi Gras in New Orleans walking down the street.  Wow.  Did that scare us?  We stood on the balcony and watched a gang of black guys punching white guys in the  face and fondling their girlfriends.  Patrice, if we just watched this from a balcony, amazed.  If we're going to keep this honest, you know, he is absolutely right.  I was stunned.  It was about nine black guys.  Yeah, it was before Katrina. 
[01:06:00]  Pre-Katrina, yeah.  Pre-Katrina.  Patrice, these guys finally got arrested, but it was an amazing scene while we were watching.  You wouldn't, and because we're on a balcony, we would see the white couple walking up the  sidewalk.  All white couples.  Only white people.  Just enjoying Mardi Gras.  They got the big hurricane drinks, and they're just like taking in the scene, right, on Bourbon  Street, and they would get to where the black guys were, and they'd start molesting the  girl, and they'd start grabbing her everywhere if she shouldn't be grabbed, and the guy goes 
[01:06:30]  like, hey, what the hell are you doing, and just, bam, gets punched in the face, and then  everyone just points at him and laughs.  They would start the kind of short, kind of small raping, and then knock him out, almost  to say, mind your business.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were knocking him out.  What they were doing was they were hitting him.  It was almost like, it was so crowded.  The streets were mobbed.  Bam.  We could see this group of black guys that they had to walk through on this particular  part of the sidewalk.  They weren't putting guys on the ground and beating them. 
[01:07:00]  And pummeling them, but they were just grabbing them.  There was one sucker punch.  They were a bitch slap.  They were a problem.  There was a kid that could have been nine years old along with them, just taunting.  Yeah.  A nine-year-old kid just taunting white people.  I don't miss going down there for Mardi Gras, man.  I do not miss that.  It sucks.  That was awful.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was crazy.  Patrice, I'm with Anthony on this one.  It was insane what we were watching.  Excuse me.  Can you not touch my girlfriend, please? 
[01:07:30]  What?  Leave her alone.  It puts you in a really bad position because you know you've got to defend her honor, and  you're like, I'm not going to win this situation.  This is bad.  Can your relationship survive you as your woman is being fond of?  Can your relationship survive you going, sweetie?  Just take it like a trooper.  Mike from...  Because I want all...  I like my teeth.  Mike from Jersey.  What am I going to really do?  Right.  A couple squeezes or my teeth.  Let's just...  Let's work out something here.  Oh, Mike from Jersey makes a really good point. 
[01:08:00]  Where's Mikey there?  He's the line 10.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, Mike.  What's up, man?  Hey, guys.  Listen, you should have let 99% of the black people ruin it for all the rest of them.  That should have been one of the quotes of the year.  That would have to be a genius racist quote, actually.  It's very funny for a racist.  And that's why we do quotes of the year, bits like that, because then it adds to...  Oh, right.  Then it leads to something else.  Jew Monkey, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, what's up, boys?  This one's staring you in the face. 
[01:08:30]  Why are you not doing the Opie and Anthony quotes of the year?  You do the Opie and Anthony bell rings of the year.  You've got a whole series there, and you've got only tomorrow to take care of this.  Oh, boy.  No, we don't.  No, we don't.  Tomorrow's Saturday.  Hey, well, why don't you start it?  What's your favorite O and A quote of the year?  Well, it's the bell rings mostly, but I've got to thank Anthony for all that.  I can go back a couple of years with Jay Moore doing Gay Marco like you read about, but  not one spot in mind right now.  I'm sorry, boys.  Letting you down.  All right.  How about of the year, sir?  We're not looking for 99. 
[01:09:00]  Well, you're on to something, J.M.  Thank you very much.  And how about lingering longer, boys?  All right?  I am a listener.  How about that?  All right.  Get a hold of yourself.  Thank you, J.M.  Yeah, we'll do O and A quotes of the year.  If you've got one, why don't you give us a call?  Try to make sure it's within the last year.  Patrice O'Neill in studio playing comics next week, next Friday and Saturday, down there  on 14th Street and 9th Avenue here in New York City.  For info, to see Patrice O'Neill, 212-524-2500 or check out patriceoneill.com.  That's a good plug right there.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  It's at comics, too, by the way. 
[01:09:30]  I didn't say comics?  No, you just kind of say he'll be somewhere.  Oh, my God.  Patrice O'Neill will be in a park.  And I was patting myself on the back like I just did something nice for you, except  mention the place you're going to be.  Wow, we need vacation.  You are ready to get out of here.  Oh, yeah.  You can tell, right?  Chris Rock's going to be here in a half hour, though.  He'll help us out.  He'll help us to the end of this show today.  Drew Boogie takes us to the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Don't chase me, bro.  Don't chase me, bro. 
[01:10:00]  Don't chase me.  Don't chase me, bro.  Don't chase me, bro.  Roger Clemens is in George's box. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Thank you.  Goodness gracious.  Joe Boogie doing that live for us today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  When you talk about quotes as far as the Opie and Anthony show go, that's a biggie right  there.  I know she did it for everybody, but we really took advantage of that one more than anybody  in America.  Susan Waldman getting all excited when Roger Clemens showed up in the Steinbrenner's box 
[01:11:00]  and then it was apparent and obvious to everyone that he was coming back to pitch for the Yankees  and go 5-14.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Or whatever he did.  There's another quote coming in here.  Kevin in New Rochelle.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  For the year?  I love the garlic butter saw.  That should have been a quote.  Well, we're starting to get the Opie and Anthony quotes of the year together, and yes, Kevin  is referring to this one.  I love the garlic butter saw. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, that's one of the biggies for the year.  Let's say hi to Sonny in New York.  Sonny, what's up?  Yeah, how about when E-Rock told Opie to shut up?  Yeah, that was a good one.  E-Rock was in the middle of choking after doing the cinnamon challenge and told me to shut  up, which was classic.  Hey, I want to point everyone in the direction of YouTube today.  Our Money Honey videos are up there, and they're really, really good to check out.  Squitty.  Yesterday, Patrice, we had four really hot women and two pigs. 
[01:12:00]  Just pigs.  How much did I get to see that?  Naked.  They covered themselves in honey, and we had $2,500 cash on the floor in the studio, and  $2,500 in ones looks like a lot of money.  I mean, $2,500.  Covers the floor, yeah.  Obviously, it is a lot of money, but it looks like it's even more than $2,500.  And then we tied their hands together, so they couldn't use their hands, and they had a roll  around in the money, and whatever stuck to their bodies, they got to keep. 
[01:12:30]  And the videos are up on YouTube under Money Honey.  What's the search for that?  Opie Money Honey.  Opie Anthony Money Honey, okay?  And check out the videos on YouTube.  They're terrific.  And by the time they rolled around a little bit, they weren't naked anymore.  They were completely covered from head to toe with dollar bills.  It worked like a charm yesterday, so I want to make sure people check out the videos over  the weekend.  All right.  Chris Rock's coming in.  He's promoting New Year's Eve at the Garden.  Yes.  That's a nice gig, huh?  It certainly is.  Wowee.  Wowee. 
[01:13:00]  Good for Chris Rock.  Hey.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  I just have a question for E-Rock.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Well, were you on Pal Talk last night?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Why do you ask?  Why?  What happened?  Well, I just get a little PM from somebody that says,  E-Rock came in on a Schwenk's show last night. 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  Grab a mic.  The nighttime jock here.  The nighttime jock here.  So you're in the K-Rock room?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because the station here has their own Pal Talk thing going at night after we leave.  Yeah.  A new camera starts up.  And you can look in on the studio, watch the jocks.  Right.  And here at K-Rock.  I'm sure it's a lot of fun.  You see them sitting here cueing up.  I met him, actually.  He's a good guy.  I'm sure he's a good guy.  But that's a good point you make there, Jimmy.  And I got to go both. 
[01:14:00]  I got to agree with both on that one.  He's a nice guy, but.  Any show, just because you can't do anything, you're just sitting there by yourself.  Yeah.  And, um, let's see.  Uh, there's Bad Kitty underscore ENC.  Do you know that name?  Yeah.  Okay.  E-Rock came in on Schwenk's show last night, and he was ass hammered and mean.  Were you?  No.  Um, let's see. 
[01:14:30]  Uh, yeah, he was mean as hell to me.  Uh, he went on cam all hammered, oogling my cam, yelling at me to get naked.  He's effing lucky he gets an occasional wow from me.  Yeah, the drug addict, right.  Where's the drug addict?  This is the, no, there's a thing here at K-Rock.  They all know about this lady here.  This camera right there, Jim.  Um, she.  Where is the whore?  I don't know. 
[01:15:00]  She's constantly drinking and doing stuff, and then she blacks out on camera.  And she, see this air conditioner there?  She'll, like, lean back, fall asleep, and be drooling, and, while the camera's on.  So, um, no, we logged in.  The K-Rock cameras, uh, system wasn't on, so we logged in.  There was a bunch of people here in the studio, and, uh, they were, we were all just, uh,  posting stuff to her.  Wait, is that her?  Bunch of people, huh?  So, miss, uh, what, what is she saying happened?  Because we were being a little mean to her last night.  Why would you be mean to her? 
[01:15:30]  She looks like a lovely girl.  Yeah, why would you be mean to her?  She seems, yeah.  I don't know.  Some people here don't care for her.  Why?  Why, though?  I don't know.  Why do you have so much anger towards women?  Yeah.  I don't have any anger.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  Yes, you do.  I don't.  Uh, she's saying there wasn't a bunch of people.  You're such an effing liar.  No, Matt.  Well, but.  Swanker can also attest.  But proven E-Rock.  Hold on, hold on.  Proven E-Rock's point.  She did type, there wasn't a munch of people.  So, she might be under the influence right now.  Well, maybe there weren't a munch.  That's fair.  Is the m close to the b on the keyboard? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Well, should we talk to her?  But, uh, I'm just curious.  The jock was here?  Yeah.  Okay.  I would hope the jock would be here.  And there was also some of, um, the promotion people that were here that came over after the  party.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, two of the web guys were in here.  Had you been drinking?  No.  Were you being mean?  A little bit.  All right.  Not drinking, no.  No, just, just wondering.  It wasn't, it wasn't just me typing.  I want both sides of the story. 
[01:16:30]  That's all I was looking for.  All right.  When I get an alert like this coming through, I, uh, I like getting both the sides of the,  uh, story.  Let's go to Vinny in Niagara Falls.  Vinny, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Vinny.  Quote of the year.  Yeah.  Quote of the year is picture your grandma naked.  Yeah, we did a great bit with picture your grandmother naked.  What was that?  Just, uh, just, just to try to horrify people out there.  No one wants to picture their grandmother naked, so it's picture your grandmother naked  and then doing horrific things after that. 
[01:17:00]  Do you have a grandma?  No.  Oh.  I can picture my grandmother, not only can I picture her naked, but I can picture her  closing her eyes, yelling in the mouth, not the face.  Oh, my God.  Mongo the trucker.  What's up, Mongo?  Hey, how about, uh, Billy Connolly saying, uh, they hate their fans.  It's brilliant.  Yeah, that was one of the best quotes of the year from, uh, Billy Connolly, who's  hilarious.  Very nice there, Mongo.  And it was good meeting you the other night, or last week, I guess, huh? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, it was.  It was a little fun party.  Hey, Jimmy, I got tickets for, uh, March 15th in Tagistair to Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Go to Ticketmaster.com or look at Jimmy's MySpace page for his 2008 tour.  You're a good boy, Mongo.  Mongo is, uh, he's a faithful one.  Let's say hi to Jennifer in Jersey.  Jennifer.  Yes, hi.  First, Jimmy, thank you so much.  When I flashed you at the, at the concert, you said that my breath was lovely.  But the quote of the year has to be, space shovel endeavor. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Good old Andrew from Brooklyn.  Space shovel endeavor.  We're going to be, we're going to be replaying Andrew from Brooklyn, uh, while we're off for  a week.  Uh, but this is the famous quote.  One of the best quotes of the year.  Space shovel endeavor.  Thank you, Jennifer.  Thank you.  Hey, I got a little audio from, uh, last night's, uh, big Christmas party here in New York.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It's time to play.  Guess who's doing this karaoke song?  Ooh.  We were secretly recording the staff last night. 
[01:18:30]  Yes, we were.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Hey.  Hold the press.  Hold the press.  Hold the press.  Hold the press.  That's where I go.  Yeah, hold the press.  Keep on the other part I'm playing.  Hey.  Paid for every dance.  Selling intro ends.  Oh, what do they say?  Oh, what do they say?  Oh, what do they say?  When you think that's the way?  What will they say about me?  When the end comes, I know that we're just as big a load. 
[01:19:00]  Life goes on without me.  I don't just go everywhere I go.  I know.  Yeah.  Some retard.  There's someone that wants to be liked by everybody.  Who is that?  Is it really David Leroth thinking he still worked here?  Is that it?  Is that it?  Well, that should be the clue right there.  It's a David Leroth song.  Yeah.  It's, uh, that's our, the big boss there, Tom Chiasano, doing Just a Gigolo last night 
[01:19:30]  at the Christmas party.  First time.  I'm still a hero man.  Come on.  I'm still a hero man.  We can't go back away.  What do they say about me?  I'm still a hero man.  I'm still a hero man.  And I'm still a hero man.  Life goes on without me.  Oof.  I ain't got no fight. 
[01:20:00]  Everybody.  I'm trying to get everyone involved last night.  I don't like the fact that Tom is confident enough to sing so badly.  You say he doesn't drink?  A little bit.  A little bit.  We're trying to get to the boss of Moosey Bop thing.  Oh, that's a great part. 
[01:20:30]  Tom reminds me of a board member of a vampire, like the vampire board member.  They always, yeah, the vampire's got the upper echelon board member.  Six head vampires and he's just one of them.  Such an elitist guy.  I ain't got no fight. 
[01:21:00]  I don't get it.  One more.  Oh, God.  Look at the picture.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Wow.  That's no love, baby.  Well, it goes on forever, but you get the point.  That's Tom Chiasano doing his karaoke last night.  So happy I forgot about that awful event.  We secretly recorded him last night.  I guarantee he wears tighty-whities. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  He does.  That's completely unsexy.  There you go.  You know what?  You might be wrong, though.  Tom might actually think he looks good in Speedos.  It wouldn't surprise me if he wore Speedos, because he's pompous enough to think,  that he really looks good.  Pompous enough.  He's a gentleman that takes care of himself and is very proud of the way he looks, I guess.  I think he wears nice suits. 
[01:22:00]  He invented metrosexuality.  Metrosexuality?  Metrosexuality, whatever the hell it's called, back in the day.  He's like the American Psycho guy growing up.  Yeah, definitely.  We met him.  That's a good analogy, dude.  We met him.  I use a moisturizing facial scrub.  I love that.  And you see what he was singing?  You know he probably murders people to, like, Cyndi Lauper songs?  This is Cyndi Lauper.  I see a true color. 
[01:22:30]  Tom wants to think that he's machete-ing somebody.  True colors.  Is he sawing through them?  He wants to think that he actually is a gigolo.  He wants people to think that.  I bet you in his age group, he's a hot dude.  I guarantee it.  Like, in his age group, he's a-  Oh, all the-  Women chase him.  The women are just chasing him around.  From 35 to 50.  I believe.  I'd imagine that they want him bad.  Didn't he turn the big 6-0 this year or something like that?  And he's got braces.  So, let's think about that for a minute. 
[01:23:00]  Did he really?  Yeah.  God, I love white people for that.  Did y'all just-  What?  60 is young for you.  Like, that is just amazing to me, man.  That you start families at 66.  Like, Tom will get some girl pregnant at 60.  That's amazing that y'all-  What's 60?  You would do that.  I'm not even getting braces, and I need them badly.  But I'm like, fool.  You need them?  Why?  They're just a mess.  What's 60 in black years?  I grind.  28?  Put it this way.  Jesus. 
[01:23:30]  I'm a 118-year-old white man.  There you go.  Y'all live so long, man.  Yeah, we do it a little differently.  White people like to have kids a lot later than the black people.  I don't understand, man.  Although, we got-  Not Britney Spears.  She's proven us wrong.  No, our white trash is pretty good.  Yeah, our white trash keeps up with you guys.  Definitely.  They will have kids very young.  Which all just live forever.  In Boston, I grew up in just-  You just see these Irish broads that want to die, and they can't. 
[01:24:00]  Almost like the priest from that Demi Moore movie.  He just prays for the end of the world so he can die.  But what about the old guys that are like, let me tell you about 1905?  Well, those guys are actually 45 years old.  Yeah.  And they're talking about 1970.  You know, the boxcar Negroes lived long.  Yeah.  Those, the Negroes from Malcolm, when Malcolm X was called Big Red, they lived forever. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  You had to get assassinated to be, but now, I don't know what it is, man.  We died.  We just die early.  Yeah.  Early.  And white people, I guess, are dying earlier than usual.  96.  You know what I mean?  96.  Usually, you definitely live in your hundreds.  I don't know, though.  And whenever they show, like, the world's oldest woman or something, it's usually a black woman.  Or an Asian woman somewhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  I could say this into a current news story.  We lost one of the last surviving World War I vets. 
[01:25:00]  He was 109.  Wait, wait, wait.  One of the last surviving.  Only two known survivors left.  Of World War?  One.  Wow.  One of the last U.S. World War I survivors died at 109.  And that's...  And then in parentheses, it says only two known survivors left, so I don't know if that means  there's only one now.  Two left.  Or two left after this guy died.  I guess two left.  And his family probably said that was a big surprise.  Just so sudden.  Yeah.  You know, we was expecting to have his...  We was playing his 186th birthday. 
[01:25:30]  Right, right.  Yeah.  I love when they talk about someone that's really old.  And he still eats applesauce.  Has all his teeth.  Right.  You know, he starts to shrink up in that...  He likes to play Monopoly.  Bay shrimp kind of posture.  Yeah.  But old Chinese ladies turn that into a way to pick up cans if you...  Yeah, you go down to Chinatown.  You see one of those 9,000-year-old Chinese ladies, and they're just walking around with  two bags on each shoulder full of cans, and you just...  9,000-year-old.  And you want to help them, and they just go...  Do you need help with that bag, lady? 
[01:26:00]  Nah.  Hey, we're heading for the break.  We got Chris Rock.  He's standing by.  He's going to join the program in a few minutes here.  We should get the football picks out of the way, so we could clear the show for Chris Rock.  The football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  Now, Jimmy's a big Cowboys fan.  What do you think of the controversy with T.O. and Jessica Simpson and Tony Roma? 
[01:26:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  There you go.  They're making a big deal about it on TV.  They blew that off a little bit.  Well, Terrell always said he was joking when he said that, you know, Tony's relationship  with Jessica is messing him up.  But they did show her in the stands wearing, like, kind of a pink version of her jersey.  Yeah, now she's a football wife.  Yeah.  You know, she...  I'd like to drop kick a football right into her teeth.  Watch her gums swell up.  But there's so many average, like, square bras that look so much better than Jessica  Simpson that he could just control as opposed to this star, wannabe star person that's 
[01:27:00]  going to ruin his life.  Just have his gums...  Here's the problem with Jessica Simpson.  She's got, like, a man's jaw with, like, a man's dimple in front.  The John Travolta cleft...  Is she hot?  Or the cleft, whatever.  Is she white guy hot?  She's not as hot as they make her out to be, in my opinion.  What do you think?  Yes, she has a great little body, and, yeah, definitely.  She's all right, but she's got a man's jaw off your nose.  I'm going to get...  Here's a white girl I'll give you. 
[01:27:30]  Who?  That almost is worth the ridicule you'll get walking through Brooklyn with her.  Yeah.  Jessica Biel.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That is...  And then maybe that's Scarlett Johansson.  Jessica Biel is...  But wait a minute.  Black approved.  Black approved.  I like that.  Jessica Biel, though, rumors about...  What?  You know what?  Was she the one they caught holding hands on the sidelines of a football game?  And they've been hinting that she might have a little fun, you know, the other way, too. 
[01:28:00]  With the girls?  Oh, that's fine.  I thought she was going to say something else I heard.  Yeah, but the...  Huh?  Black guys?  No.  What?  No, we wouldn't destroy it like that.  This is...  That she was a hermaphrodite?  Something with it.  What?  What?  Oh, what?  Oh, oh, oh, no.  No, that's what I'm saying.  I'm not going to say that.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's just say this.  That's usually...  Oh, Romo.  Yeah, of course.  That's usually something that does go around with celebrities every so often.  You hear these rumors that they have certain sexually transmitted diseases and things 
[01:28:30]  like that.  Oh, yeah.  You can't say that.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  No.  Who are we?  Doctors?  I don't know.  I don't think we're doctors.  I'll put it this way.  I don't know if she has anything.  After all, we are not...  No bag, no nothing.  Here's the picture.  She's on the sidelines of what game?  A Packers game in October.  And she's got a girlfriend there that's kind of just cupping her butt cheek on the sideline. 
[01:29:00]  Good for her.  Football picks.  Jimmy's doing them this week.  I'll be very brief.  What do you got, Jimmy?  Well, we got the Giants versus the Bills.  And we all know that Chip Stevens is having a big year.  So I'm going to take the Giants plus 11.  Wait.  Giants by 11.  This show hates the Giants.  That's exactly it.  And we're on in Buffalo.  All right, cool.  But then again, the Bills are out of the playoffs.  Well, yeah, but, you know, I mean...  Are you officially out?  I don't think so.  Yeah, the Bills are officially out.  All right.  Browns knocked them out last week, I believe.  Chip's not having a very good year, so I'll take Bills by six. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Bills by six.  Well, now you're going with the Bills.  I think the Giants are going to win, though.  Nah, I took my opinion.  Jets versus the Titans.  Well, everybody knows, since the whole Frank Peters controversy on down there in New Orleans.  Sure, sure.  Tennessee by three.  Cleveland versus Cincinnati.  I mean, it's going to be a very tough game.  But, you know, with the leg injury to Franklin, I'm going to have to go with the Browns.  Okay.  Chiefs versus the Lions.  I mean, that's pretty much a matchup.  Lions.  Eagles versus New Orleans. 
[01:30:00]  You know, I'm going to have to go with New Orleans.  Redskins versus Vikings.  Everybody knows that without Randy Moss, I mean, who knows what's going to happen.  So, I'm going to go with the Vikings.  Dolphins versus Patriots.  I think that a lot of times, Tom Brady is going to probably sit and be nervous.  So, I'll take the Dolphins by 37.  What?  No, you can't.  No, don't do that.  These are my picks.  The Dolphins by what?  37.  37.  You can't do this to me.  I take the Dolphins.  No, you can't do that.  I give 37. 
[01:30:30]  You can't.  Jimmy!  I still have a chance to win this thing.  Oh, that's great.  That was my pick.  You can't pick the Dolphins over the pack.  I count by 37.  I give 37.  It's a blowout.  It's going to be a blowout by the Dolphins.  It's a humiliating blowout.  Absolutely.  With the Bill Parcells situation, you got to...  Of course.  That would...  Yeah.  Do it for Bill.  Yeah.  You can't do that.  And do a segment over there.  Yeah.  Nothing going on over there.  I have a pick.  Of course I do.  Wow.  What a pick.  Oh, my God. 
[01:31:00]  I think you're going to need a couple upsets.  Yeah.  No, it's all good.  Okay.  Well, those are Opie's picks.  Oh.  They'll happen in the sound.  Oh, my God.  That was weird.  What happened?  Talking on the side of the mic.  Yeah, no.  These are unidirectional.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So you...  Oh, I hate you.  Why are I trying to let you do that?  Because I'm good.  You suck.  I'm very good.  I don't make broad picks.  Those are really, really bad picks.  No more plugs for New Year's.  What?  The North Fork Theater?  No.  No.  No.  Don't do it.  I don't want people going to Ticketmaster and getting my tickets.  New Year's Eve show? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  My stupid New Year's Eve show.  I'll be there.  The guys will be there.  Yeah.  I'll be there.  I'm going to go there in shame now.  No, you won't.  It'll be fun.  I'll be known as the guy that picked the dolphins over the pats.  By 37.  By 37.  That's the important part of that whole thing.  All right.  Football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  Drew Boogie in-house.  He's playing us in and out of breaks live in studio, by the way, which is really, really  cool.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hit it, Drew.  Hit it. 
[01:32:00]  I'm a damn rich boss.  I kill rich.  I kill rich.  I kill rich.  Kill rich.  I kill rich.  I kill rich.  Kill rich.  All the rest of you people can go straight down. 
[01:32:30]  Straight.  Straight down.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The last show before vacation.  We're kind of, if you haven't figured it out yet, we're kind of screwing off. 
[01:33:00]  We got Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Of course, Jim Norton.  And now, Chris Rock joins the program.  What?  Am I on?  Yeah, now you're on.  Sorry.  What's going on?  See, we can't even figure out which mic works the last day before vacation.  I'm sorry.  You realize it's just the same as, like, school?  Remember in school before vacation or before you left for summer, nothing got done?  I know nothing about school.  It's exactly right.  Nothing.  School's for white people.  Well, I sure missed it. 
[01:33:30]  Books and learning.  Maybe it was the Sicilian in me.  I missed it, a lot of it.  I just went for the first half to learn a little bit of math, English, shop skills, and then move on.  Better things to do.  This is Chris's first time here.  This is my first time, yeah.  Him and Patrice were talking about something, and apparently he complimented Patrice.  And I got to say, I didn't like it.  Well, let me say this.  It was a weird thing.  I'm sitting there, the first part of the story, it was, I thought, somebody's just starting trouble, and I thought, it's Chris. 
[01:34:00]  Well, retell the story.  I'll make believe I didn't hear this.  Well.  Because it was really good during the break.  I had to thank him because one comic said that Chris Rock said that you auditioned for Everybody Hates Chris as the Father, talking about me, and said I was awful.  I go, no, I was good at that audition.  So, Keith called me.  Keith was there.  So, Keith goes, ah, man, no, no, no, no. 
[01:34:30]  He didn't say that at all.  He said you were great.  And then he told me the real story.  You were great.  You just didn't know any of your lines.  But I didn't.  You were very unprepared.  You were very self-deprecating.  But you were great.  You were actually the best one that day.  I could have got the father, but I thought I knew my lot.  Put it this way.  I always say in auditions, I gave myself a chance to get it.  But I'm very aloof in auditions because I don't want to get too, like, I want it or too, I don't want it. 
[01:35:00]  I went in.  So, why try?  Him and Oliver.  Why try?  I was just saying, this is how I'm going to be as a father.  But the word was, okay, he was the best, but he didn't get it because of some other stuff.  But I actually felt good about that, that I was the best.  So, you finally got an opportunity to ask Chris if that was true.  Oh, you were great.  But here's the thing I heard, is that I had an attitude, and I didn't.  I know when I have an attitude.  I'm not going to say I'm not an ass. 
[01:35:30]  You didn't have an attitude.  You came in, I feel like I'm a good ass.  This is good stuff.  This is what?  I feel like Mr. Slate.  Like I'm Trump.  The reason you were let go.  But I don't like to give, I don't like to give black bosses.  Wait a minute, wait a minute, though.  I don't like to give, just let me finish.  Let the man finish.  I don't like to give black bosses any less type of respect than white bosses. 
[01:36:00]  I don't want to look at Chris and go, ah-ha, Chris.  And when I go into white things and I'm acting, I'm acting right.  I went in there to try to be business, act right.  How many black bosses have you really been across the road?  You say it like there's so many black bosses out there.  You act like you're popular among white people.  When have you ever been like nice or diplomatic?  I want it to be the same, exactly the same.  Yeah, well.  Why don't you kiss up to Chris Rocky?  Oh, he's in the studio. 
[01:36:30]  He doesn't have to kiss up to me.  You're self-destructive.  I'm not self-destructive.  Look who's telling you that.  Right.  I know a thing about being self-destructive.  I think you're being a little self-destructive.  You're being a little too cool for the room in front of Chris Rock.  Too cool?  What are you talking about now?  Yeah.  But don't think me and Chris don't both know white tricks.  This is not dividing, Piker.  I basically said thank you for the compliment because I heard the compliment.  So his acting was good? 
[01:37:00]  His acting was very good.  His acting was very good.  He just didn't know.  He didn't know the part.  And he was very, he was just killing himself.  He was basically screaming, don't hire me.  Oh, Patrice.  You know something?  That's the Patrice we know.  That sounds just like Patrice.  We know this is the man we know.  I swear to God.  Absolutely.  He sounds just like him.  I know when I'm being like that, but I wasn't.  And the guy that he went against was like, I'm ready to do this.  I know every lot.  And he probably wasn't as good as Patrice.  But he was so like, I will do everything you need to do, Mr. Rock. 
[01:37:30]  You know what?  Don't worry about it.  It's not like it's a hit show right now.  Yeah.  It's not like you see the bus boards and the billboards.  I saw your E! True Hollywood story.  You were the same way.  I was.  I was.  And that's straightened out.  Oh, all right.  All right.  That's his advice.  I'm going to try it.  I'm going to learn from Chris.  I'm learning from Chris.  I'm going to learn now.  Terry Crews was great.  But you were really good.  How many seasons are you in on that show?  We're, I think, we just finished three. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, so we're going to start four.  Four seasons.  What do you do?  Is that why you asked him that question?  Of course we did.  No, I never heard that story until you said that.  No, I wouldn't rub it.  I'm happy that I heard that.  I was wondering, when you go into a show that stars like a kid, do you think, ah, if we  get a year out of this, we're lucky?  And now you must start thinking, this kid's getting older.  He's really old and his voice has changed and he's shaven.  Yeah, it's like, what?  He's got hemorrhoids.  You've got the Harry Potter problem.  Yeah, we've got the, well, I wish I'd. 
[01:38:30]  Well, that's some problem.  That's a good problem to have.  It happened with, like, the 1D years and stuff, where I think they go into it thinking, ah,  we're lucky if it's even on the air.  And then it gets to the point where it's like, dad, I'm home.  And it's not quite the wonder years anymore.  You know, it's not this innocent child thing.  Now he's, you know, driving and having sex.  Sleeping with his aunt.  Yeah.  And his show, Everybody Loves Chris, was one of the few ones that made the leap when  they combined to make the CW and UPN closed down. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, that's right.  And his and, like, a couple others were the only ones that moved over to the new network.  Right.  Yes, because all the shows were so great.  They had to.  What's going to make it?  That was just, you could hear the collective click of white people hitting the remotes on  some of those shows.  It's like, what, there's four girls and they're living together and they're working.  I have no idea what that's about.  Click.  Yeah.  I had no real interest in seeing that. 
[01:39:30]  What?  What?  Why don't you just start it with, I'm a racist?  Yeah.  I didn't say I'm a racist.  I like my shows with a black friend.  That's what you're really saying.  Occasional black friend is great on the show.  You know, he has one cast.  He has one important scene every season.  That's where I feel.  Anthony goes, it's my safe zone.  Sticks from Happy Days.  Right.  Get us sticks. 
[01:40:00]  Look, what happened to those days?  Anthony goes, I'm not watching UPN Word.  I don't call it that.  Jesus Christ.  I just need something I can relate to a little.  Us as humans, we're just watching things we can relate to a little more.  It's like Steve Nash.  You want to see you getting a layup.  Just so Chris understands.  It's like Nash, right?  Anthony is.  Yes.  You root for Nash.  Right.  Of course you root for Nash.  Anthony's a big fan.  Oh, my God.  You root for Nash.  Anthony's a big fan of the History Channel, but he likes to call it the Hitler Channel, 
[01:40:30]  just so you know who you're dealing with here, Chris.  Well, it's the big H in the corner and stuff, of course.  No, I'm a fan of the era.  Right.  It's amazing.  Hitler can have a channel and OJ can't get a show.  OJ only killed two people.  They're fascinated with Hitler.  Hitler gets a whole channel.  Networks.  Every bit of film of that guy has been shown.  Everything.  He's a drug addict, man.  There's no Hitler outtakes.  I saw one the other day.  Hitler went sandal shopping. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  Yeah, some rare footage.  A whole hour of Hitler picking out sandals.  They find two lousy seconds of Hitler footage, and they make an hour out of it on the Hitler  channel.  OJ, nothing.  See, now I'm saying it.  Nothing for OJ.  Nothing for OJ.  Hey, Chris is playing the Garden.  We've got to get the plug in, man.  He's playing the Madison Square Garden New Year's Eve.  How cool is that, Chris?  Madison Square Garden New Year's Eve.  Yes.  And Ticketmaster for tickets.  And it's amazing to be doing that room.  It's funny.  We think we're off the air.  We said this.  But I'm like, are you doing the two rooms?  The Little Garden?  I'm doing the Dane Cook Garden. 
[01:41:30]  The Dane Cook Garden.  The Dane Cook Garden.  Oh, my God.  It's renamed.  That is the elephant in the room, too, because you're sitting there going, how do you ask  somebody, are you playing the real Garden Garden or the other thing?  But the other thing is 5,000 seats.  It's still impressive.  Yeah, that's the mini garden.  Yeah, but whenever anybody says it, you go like, ah.  I'm coming back to the other garden, the Little Garden, in April, May.  Okay, so you're doing four nights.  Four nights in the...  Jesus.  How come I do one big garden, because that adds up to four other Little Gardens?  There's, like, insurance issues. 
[01:42:00]  Let me explain a real...  Look, Chris, you've got to explain...  I know when you're settling up at the chuckle hut at the end of the night.  I'm sitting there.  You sit there with the guy from...  I don't know.  I'm really asking, like, I don't know.  From the rainy night house, and you're going over...  Tony Camacho has the check.  You asked him not to drop checks at the garden.  John Mulroney is working with you. 
[01:42:30]  You asked him not to drop checks.  Pick up to Mulroney.  Do they have wings at the garden?  We might have rings.  I've been trying to get Kentucky Fried Chicken to give out two pieces at the end of the night.  I wonder if you might make more doing four nights at the other one, because the union  You can make more money, yeah, because the union is insane.  Very expensive New York rooms are very expensive.  I mean, I understand some of the big rooms.  This is all business stuff.  It's not bad, of course.  It's all business.  Yes, yes.  Something you don't know nothing about.  I'll be at comics next week. 
[01:43:00]  I'm trying to sell four shows.  Patrice decided it was a good idea to get a website a mere three months ago.  Wow.  Remember all the times you would come on the show and be like, do you have a website to promote yourself?  See, that's how you get the show.  Exactly.  That's how he did this thing.  He doesn't know how to promote.  He goes, I feel weird promoting.  Do you see him trying now?  You are trying.  Jesus.  Patrice's brilliance is as a comedian.  You're playing some big rooms now, right?  You know, I'll get back to you.  Yes.  It's funny.  As a businessman, it's time to plug myself. 
[01:43:30]  I'm doing maybe a thousand is probably the maximum.  That's so funny.  Hey, you're out to clubs.  Yeah.  You made it.  That's the goal of every comic is to get out of the chuckle huts.  My only goal, I swear to you, was to be famous enough to not have to do radio.  That was it.  Not that I'm going to be up now, but I mean.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't have to do radio and I don't have to stay in the condo, in the comedian condo.  That's all I wanted.  You mean you're on the road?  I wanted to be like down my era. 
[01:44:00]  George Wallace was my goal.  He's been on the show a bunch.  Yeah.  That was my goal.  He shot past that.  Jesus Christ.  We should talk about the condo thing.  A lot of people out there don't understand.  When you guys go to these cities, you have to stay in the same condo that other comics  were in the week before.  The same sheets.  Right.  Because they're trying to just save money.  So these guys buy an actual condo.  Comedians are disgusting.  Right.  Right.  I can't even imagine.  You got to share.  You got to share.  Sometimes with.  I've done so many gigs with a headliner in the middle act.  Sometimes you have to share.  If you're not a headliner, you share the room with the. 
[01:44:30]  Some strange comic you barely know.  It was like damn near bunk beds.  Right.  It's like ah.  Ugh.  Yeah, I've done that.  I woke up one time.  It was three comedians in a room.  And I woke up and the two guys had left.  We had like a two hour drive to the next game.  They just left a note like we'll meet you there.  Dirt bags.  Pint.  You ever had that thing where you're at the club and they have the meal.  The menu.  And then there's the stuff the headliner can eat.  But if you're an opener.  Oh, no way. 
[01:45:00]  You can't get shrimp.  You know.  What the chintzy ass crap is that?  The middles can't get scallops.  We're sorry.  You can have the chicken wings.  Chicken wings for you.  I was doing a club recently up in Massachusetts and they said that the MCs, the opening acts  couldn't get soda.  I'm like you don't give the guys.  I can see alcohol.  You know what I don't like?  Wow.  I saw one that said don't touch the waitresses.  Was that a problem?  You know what's bothering you about this conversation?  What?  Norton and Chris Rock are having a nostalgic conversation that I still live. 
[01:45:30]  If you had the right attitude, you're as funny as both of us.  I'm not going to sit here and say I'm funnier than you.  I guess it's time to tell you this is an intervention for you.  You thought we were having Chris Rock to promote his New Year's gig, but it's really an intervention  to get you on the right track.  How do people be able to move on from old school news?  I'm not like that.  I'll tell you what it is.  As a comedian.  You're like Whitney Houston.  You're going to have to be clean for 10 years before we buy it. 
[01:46:00]  Like, ooh, we're supposed to just buy it now?  But she's looking good again.  Yeah, yeah.  She's looking good.  You've got to prove it to the public.  I need four crackless albums before I buy something.  I'm going to have to be like Michael Vick after he gets out.  I'm going to have to take care of dogs.  You're going to work at a shelter.  You're going to pet every dog you see walking by.  You're going to have to shake hands with a few audience members as they walk out.  Thank you, club owners for having you.  Because it's not your act.  People love your act. 
[01:46:30]  People love your act.  It's who you are.  They hate you.  It's garbage.  They just hate you as a person.  This is your intervention.  I've been waiting for this day.  There is no awful human beings.  I'm a good person.  I'm just.  You just got a thing about you.  That's what it is.  I can name ten guys.  You're funny.  And you know what?  You know what?  This is how you know.  This is how you know.  They're way more successful than you.  This is.  Chris is talking to me like a middle-aged white man.  That's how middle-aged white people talk to me. 
[01:47:00]  You know I'm finished.  Because Chris is like, look, my son.  You need to work on this.  If you think it's just jokes, you got.  The joke's the only half of the battle.  This is every conversation you have about Patrice goes like this.  He's a funny guy.  This is years ago.  This is in the mid-90s.  I used to do this.  I met him.  I hated Patrice.  He's Tom Possidy.  I met him.  And he was like, we're doing this hell gig for Jamie Dukin. 
[01:47:30]  It was a college.  I was opening.  You keep telling that story.  I killed that room, by the way.  You didn't kill it that room.  It doesn't matter.  It's not about the comedy.  It's not about the jokes.  It's the delusion of who he is.  I had maybe a one.  Help me help you.  He's Rod Tidwell.  I like to see him sweat.  It's rare you sweat on our show, man.  All right.  I guess it's just a deal. 
[01:48:00]  Nobody's got a bad thing to say.  No.  No.  About as funny.  It's just my essence.  Before they trash you, they'll say things like, yeah, it's funny.  Are you friends with him?  Patrice O'Neal will not be at the garden.  He'll be at the undergarden.  Chris Rock wants to make it perfectly clear.  He doesn't want you painting his garden appearance. 
[01:48:30]  There's the 5,000, there's the 20,000, and then there's the bathroom.  Oh, poor Patrice.  Hey, are you working with anybody in the garden?  Jill Scott.  Jill Scott for the ladies.  She's opening?  Yeah, she's opening.  Wow.  I don't know Jill Scott.  I don't either.  Okay.  I want to find out about...  If you're having sex with a black woman, you'd know.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  She's big.  Yeah.  Neo soul, as they used to call it.  I don't know.  Oh, wait.  She's the performer.  She does music.  Yeah, yeah.  I knew...  All right.  I know who...  Oh, she's not a comic? 
[01:49:00]  No, no.  Oh, you was thinking comedian Jill Scott?  I was thinking comedian Jill Scott.  I've heard of Jill Scott.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't really know what she...  I just know she's in music.  That's smart.  Have music in front of you, because this way you don't have to worry about somebody stepping  on everything you want to talk about.  Exactly.  That's why Pryor did it with Patti LaBelle.  Exactly.  I'm going to start doing that music.  When I saw Dane Cook at the guard, it was just him and a stool.  No opening act.  Nothing.  Hour and a half.  Dane just came out.  Yeah.  That was...  I'm like, wow, that's pretty pompous.  Not even a warm-up.  35 minutes of scream.  Right, right.  Give us a bed or something to hang out with for a while. 
[01:49:30]  I hate working in the round.  Not that I have an opportunity to do it.  Believe me, I very rarely do.  Shut up, stupid.  You're not in the round yet.  Not even...  You can't count the Westbury Music Fair.  I'm only doing half.  Believe me, every time I'm in the round, there's a curtain.  It's like, well, we felt I'd be more intimate.  You're in the crescent.  And no one wants to see your back.  You were getting to something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When you hosted the Oscars, all we had to hear was from Rich Voss about how he was writing 
[01:50:00]  for Chris Rock.  Good.  Finally.  And all I wanted to do is...  He might have got a couple in there.  Did he?  Yeah, I think he got a couple.  He bragged about that for a year.  And the intros.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All he was talking about, though, is, well, I gotta get over and I see Chris where I'm  writing.  It's like, what could you possibly be writing?  He would call us from L.A. in between writing sessions.  And just talk about that.  Make sure everyone knew what he was doing.  Every time we talked to him, he had to bring that up. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  And it's still one of his big credits.  How long after you hired Voss did you realize, all right, this was a mistake?  He's a nice guy, but he contributes very little, and he's dumb.  He'd have some stuff.  He'd have some dirt.  He'd have some stuff.  I forgot you hosted, man.  That was so great.  It was so fun to watch.  It was so great, they never called again.  Good, though.  What the hell was that about?  Wait, wait.  Did it again?  Hold on.  I'll tell you what that's about.  That means he did a great job.  As a comedian...  No, I'm serious.  You were a comedian doing the Oscars.  It was great to watch.  Just smashing them. 
[01:51:00]  I loved it.  That stupid Jude Law.  Oh, who is he?  That was so great.  And then Sean Penn, who's one of our finest...  Shut your mouth.  One of our finest actors.  Boy, what a sense of humor that guy's got.  Chris will say it.  Sean should have taken the joke.  Oh, what a douche.  It was just nice to see a comic doing that and not being polite to him, but really tearing  the throat to him.  Absolutely.  It was great, man.  Thank you.  Could you hang for a little longer?  Patrice, see how I said thank you?  Wait a minute, let me practice.  That goes a long way.  That goes a long way, Patrice.  Thank you, Chris.  See, I'm going to follow you. 
[01:51:30]  Let me just practice saying thank you to people.  Just say something to me, Owen.  I don't have anything I can say to you.  It's okay.  Thanks anyway for...  I'm trying to learn instead of going, ugh.  This is Patrice in a compliment because he is a sweet guy, but he doesn't...  He doesn't want anyone to know that.  He's got that tough outer shell that you've got to break through.  If you said, Patrice, that hosting job you did was so good that one time, shut up.  Right, right.  That's Patrice.  Patrice doesn't realize...  I know.  He doesn't realize he's a big black man. 
[01:52:00]  So he thinks he's going, hey, how you doing?  But what we hear is...  Ooga booga!  Thank you so much for the opportunity.  Ooga booga booga booga booga!  People who don't like Patrice hate him.  Because he gets the people because if he teases you he's loud, you're not going to be louder  than he is.  I never realized he couldn't take a compliment properly because I had complimented you on  your appearances on The Office, even though they were very brief, but you were very good. 
[01:52:30]  Can I tell you really quickly why...  People always, when they write Patrice, they make sure they can write them out, too.  I don't know how this is going to work.  Put a pre-existing medical condition in the character description.  It starts off with diabetes in the show.  He's boisterous with a heart condition.  Just in case.  That fun-loving, weak-hearted man.  It starts off with diabetes in a doctor's appointment.  First episode.  First episode. 
[01:53:00]  You could go into a coma in season two.  They don't want to lose a minute of production time.  If you're lucky.  Oh, man.  Actually, Arrested Development, too.  I love that show.  I think I got thrown out of there for the same reason.  Why?  I don't think I said thank you.  Yeah, see, that's your problem.  What are you going to do?  I don't...  What are you...  Just...  See?  Just be nice.  I think we only...  You have to be somewhere.  We only have you for another ten minutes or so.  Whatever you need.  I'm here.  Can we take a quick break and then continue? 
[01:53:30]  For you?  Sure.  Oh, wow.  And he doesn't like doing radio, so that's a compliment.  Who does?  Jesus Christ.  I didn't know.  Do that one more time.  For you?  See, I know exactly.  See, there was nothing in me to even know to say that.  That was just acting, though.  But it was...  That wasn't sincere.  That was just acting.  No, but I know!  That's what he's saying!  All right, listen.  For you, sure.  Quick break.  Rock at the Garden.  Just a quick plug.  Ticket Master.  Obviously, it's a New Year's Eve show.  It's an amazing place.  You're already in the city.  So if you go to the show, it's like, what, at 9 o'clock? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  You're out by like 10.30.  No, no, no.  We're going to do...  Are you bringing the New Year?  Yeah, we're going to bring the New Year.  Are you going to rock?  That's a long show.  Oh, okay, great.  The other thing...  I love...  First of all, let me just say something very subtle that Jimmy slipped in there.  Yeah.  He goes, Chris Rock, playing the Garden.  You're already in the city.  See, in other words, he's like, don't drive from Long Island...  Where I'm going to be.  ...where he's going to be, and go to the city.  Can I say that?  What are you playing?  I'm doing Westbury Music Fair.  Don't brag. 
[01:54:30]  Hey, we've got to take a quick break.  Really fast.  I do want to say that I'm a huge fan of your comedy CDs, and I had no idea you had a CD  out until literally a minute ago.  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  It's like a greatest...  This is the greatest hits.  The greatest hits.  It's called The Greatest Bits.  Chris Rock, Cheese and Crackers.  So check that out as you're doing your holiday shopping, right?  Yeah.  Or download it from iTunes, whatever you want to do.  Greatest Hits is out.  Perfect for the holiday.  All right.  Perfect gift.  More with Chris Rock.  We've got Drew Boogie playing us the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Let's hear it for Flavor Flames. 
[01:55:00]  Flavor Flames.  Let's do this shot.  Everybody say...  Everybody say...  Everybody say...  Everybody say...  Everybody say...  everybody say oh 
[01:55:30]  better check yourself before you wreck yourself  better check yourself before you wreck yourself  Rest yourself.  Rest yourself. 
[01:56:00]  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show in studio.  Chris Rock, we're really excited that he's sitting in here with us.  Louis C.K. became a friend of our show in the last year.  Good man.  Thanks to Jim Norton.  And we've been telling Louis, you've got to help us get Chris Rock in studio.  I'm glad it's finally happening, man.  He's promoting his New Year's Eve show at the Madison Square Garden,  which is very, very sweet.  Dan Cook got it.  The Knicks got it.  And the tour kicks off in February.  You can go to chrisrock.com.  And I forgot about this, too. 
[01:56:30]  You were voted the fifth best comic of all time by Comedy Central.  And I know, like, voting in the poll.  That might be good or bad.  Who was ahead of you?  Was Yakov Shmirnoff ahead of you?  Carrot Top.  Bobby Slayton.  Pryor.  Pryor.  Pryor Carlin.  Herrera.  Pryor Carlin.  Joe Bolster.  Woody Allen?  Yeah, Woody.  Wait, wait, wait.  Where was Bill Cosby at?  Bill Cosby was number, I want to say number eight.  Oh, I'm not better than Cosby.  I think you are, actually.  I like Cosby, but I like the fact that you attack socially. 
[01:57:00]  And Cosby is a great comedian.  Why is Pryor undisputed number one, you think?  I mean, he is number one.  I like Cosby and Pryor.  They're like one and one-eight of me.  But, you know.  That's me and Pryor and Carlin.  And Carlin.  That's like, okay, that's the big three.  I like Cosby, but I don't like him better than I like Pryor.  I don't like him better than Carlin.  I don't like him better than I like you.  Only because as great as he was and as great a performer he is and as brilliant as he is,  he doesn't attack social stuff.  You always, and I like this about you, always, like we were talking about Michael Vick one 
[01:57:30]  night at the Cellar.  And Chris wasn't even doing a bit, but just the angle you seem to hit these things from  is always like, oh, all right.  That's always an interesting point of view.  Poor Michael Vick.  I would have loved to see him play this year, man.  That would have been so much fun.  I know, man.  They'd be getting ready for the playoffs right now.  I watched a game this year.  A guy got paralyzed and they kept playing.  Yeah?  So you could paralyze a guy, but if you kill a dog, you can't play.  You think he'll be back next year? 
[01:58:00]  A man can't walk.  Fine.  He'll put a 50 on him.  Yeah.  He was shaking, convulsing.  They gave him a penalty for talking in the end zone.  Michael Vick.  Kill some dogs.  That's the social commentary you're talking about right there, Jim.  Yeah, but it was really an interesting point of view.  And I'm not going to give away the bit, but it's something about how they arrest you  if you go to the bathroom in the park and they have parks, just places for the dogs to  go to the bed.  It was just really great. 
[01:58:30]  That is great.  In conversation, I was like, that's great.  I got to ask Chris about India.  You just got back from India?  I did just.  I'm shooting a weird documentary.  My Borat-ish movie about black women in hair weaves and hair weaves come from India.  But okay, I'm not making this up.  India, you get off the plane and you go to baggage claim and in baggage claim was a big  pile of S-H-I-T. 
[01:59:00]  And I didn't see an animal anywhere.  And that was probably the most pleasant smell in my six days there.  Wait, there was a pile of crap at baggage claim in India.  Did it say hors d'oeuvre under it?  So that's all you need to know.  Wow.  But the people were pretty nice.  But every now and then there'd be some crap on the ground.  Did you just expect to get some kind of disease or at least spend a lot of time on the bowl? 
[01:59:30]  It's weird.  Every time you drink water, you had to bring your own water.  And sometimes people would try to give you water and tell you it was boiled.  And I kind of lived off Pop-Tarts and peanut butter for like four days, man.  Yeah, I'd be afraid to eat anything.  It was, put it in the way, I spent my last two Christmases in Africa.  And it ain't nothing.  Africa is Hershey, Pennsylvania compared to India.  Wow. 
[02:00:00]  Why Africa?  Are you doing gigs?  Well, I went to, you know, Oprah called up and went down there for the opening of school.  When Oprah calls, you got to go.  Yeah.  Patrice was on the list.  Didn't check his email.  You see how he knows about self-destruction?  I'm trying.  How come you can't give me the same?  He just said, everybody changes.  Don't check his email.  That had nothing. 
[02:00:30]  That's what Chris used to do.  And he still has that thing because he spelled the word fully that he didn't say.  He spelled it out.  He knows how to do radio.  That's what I'm saying.  He knows that.  He doesn't like doing radio, but he knows how to do it.  Oh, man.  That's funny.  I don't like waking up.  Yeah, I know.  I have no problem with radio.  Yeah, sleeping late.  You wanted to be famous enough where when you go to Florida, Miami, and they say Chris Rock's  coming, you want the show to be sold before you get there so you don't have to go and sell it in the morning.  Hey, you know, Bobby Slayton, Don Marrera, Bobby Collins. 
[02:01:00]  That's all I wanted.  But we were saying at the break, though, Chris Rock is famous.  Bobby Collins' career?  That's what I want.  Bobby Collins packs him in there.  Everybody's happy.  Right.  They're always happy.  That's all you wanted.  Let me ask you this.  Now, you think there's a difference between white fame and black fame, right?  Yeah, and Puerto Rican fame.  But I'm saying you've been black famous for how much longer than you've been?  Yeah, these guys had this discussion during the break. 
[02:01:30]  Patrice looks at Chris Rock and goes, you've been black famous for over 20 years.  I guess so, but you could make a million black people laugh, but one white man will make  him rich.  That's true.  Bernie Mac, right?  Wasn't Bernie Mac very famous before he got to a black guy?  Ultimately, it would be some white guy.  I think you're funny.  Yeah, you're hysterical.  Here's a check.  Well, when you are...  I think you're hilarious because you're a guy who changed your life.  But everyone knew who you are by SNL, you know, from Saturday Night Live and stuff. 
[02:02:00]  Enough to get in a club.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then after that, it kind of went on.  You kept things going.  You're in a couple of movies, and then you did your stand-up.  Just put you over the top, man.  Brought me back.  Yeah.  Just trying to hang in there.  Yeah, just trying to hang in.  You know who's black famous?  Mike Epps is black famous.  He's moving into...  He's in most white people.  They know kind of who he is.  A lot of people know Mike Epps.  Young white kids know Mike Epps from the Fridays.  Maybe young guys do, especially from the Fridays.  If you say Mike Epps to most people, they don't know who he is. 
[02:02:30]  But yeah, he still does.  Like Tracy Morgan's white famous, but he was black famous when he was on Martin playing  Hustleman.  Yeah, I don't even remember that.  Yes.  You know?  Notice that behavior works for Tracy.  Won't work for you.  Yeah.  I don't know how Tracy...  Only one black man could behave like Tracy at a time.  I don't even understand.  Only one dead.  Only one crazy nigga in Hollywood.  I don't understand that.  How Tracy gets and keeps work.  I think he's lovable.  He's insane.  The guy's a madman. 
[02:03:00]  But who's funnier than Tracy Morgan?  I know.  He really is a funny guy.  Can any of us in this room go, yeah, I'm funnier than Tracy Morgan?  I can't say that.  If you're ever standing in a room with that guy, he will be the center of attention and  you'll be laughing your ass off.  That guy is always funny.  Yeah.  I bring it up a lot.  I went and saw him at Caroline's and he decided he needed to show the front row his...  Somebody go get pregnant tonight.  Right, right.  But he decided not to do comedy anymore and he was obsessed with showing girls his private  area.  Let's just put it that way.  For a half hour, I'm like, he's never going to be in Caroline's ever again. 
[02:03:30]  I want you to have my daughter.  And sure enough, three months later, he's back there and selling out the club.  Tracy would possibly be the funniest dude you ever...  He's one of the funniest guys ever.  We love when he comes on the show.  We just can't figure him out.  Chris Farley was just like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just this uncontrollable oozing.  We miss Chris Farley.  Anyone that's talked about him has said, like, even just hanging out in a room with him,  you'll be laughing your ass off.  The guy was always on.  Always.  Wasn't the 10-year, they call it anniversary, which I think's weird, but it was 10 years, 
[02:04:00]  right, that he passed?  I think that just passed.  Yeah.  Geez.  Yeah, I miss him, man.  It's been 10 years?  Yeah, he was unbelievable.  You've done any stuff?  Because you seem to make a lot of good choices with shows and stuff.  You've done any stuff?  I think so.  Yeah, man.  I mean, as far as, like, the HBO show and the stand-up and then you segway into movies.  Trying to stay in the business, man.  Doing well, though.  Leathal up in four.  Trying to say no, sometimes.  You can actually say no.  I've never said no. 
[02:04:30]  If you say no enough times...  See, the people that work with you want to make money.  So they'll come back with something.  I love how he's downplaying his career in front of us.  He's a monster.  If you say no, you'd be amazed.  They'll come back.  Is there anything you wish...  They live off of 10% of what you make.  Oh, no, they don't.  My managers live off of what Robin Williams makes.  I'm in the tax write-off category.  Like they were trying to help this kid.  They need a couple of bombs.  Yeah, believe me.  They're not living off what I'm making.  Is there anything you did that you wish you didn't do? 
[02:05:00]  Um, not really.  I mean, there's stuff that, you know, you watch and go, ooh, maybe.  But it was a learning experience.  Yeah, but you end up being a learning...  Sometimes things end up being a learning experience.  Sometimes you make...  You get good relationships if you come on time and, you know...  You ever say...  Don't get the pipe.  Remember your lines.  I did a movie with...  This movie called Bad Company that didn't go great.  But I met Jerry Bruckheimer and there's a relationship there.  And Anthony Hopkins and, you know, Kerry Washington, all these people. 
[02:05:30]  And it was, you know...  You ever said no to anything that you go, oh, man, I should have said yes to that.  Really?  You ever say no to something that somebody else became famous from you saying no to?  Oh, I said...  I love those stories, yeah.  What did I say no to?  I'm not even sure.  A lot of stuff just dies in the...  In the process?  I don't want to...  Because some of us say no to it.  It's like they bombed and you're like, you know...  Yes.  People have child support payments to make over.  I don't want to judge anybody. 
[02:06:00]  It's like, I knew that movie was going to suck.  I knew.  You announced at Live Earth that you're doing a Ricky Gervais movie.  Were you kidding or no?  I was kidding.  Oh, you are?  I was kidding.  I'll do a movie.  I love it.  We just had him on the show the other day.  He's funny.  He's great.  Speaking of which, you're going to go over to London and perform?  Yeah, yeah.  Right after the New Year.  Yeah.  We've got a whole bunch of...  Comedy's a lot different over there, no?  I hear that all the time, but...  I hear that.  I've been on stage over there.  I never really did gigs there.  But I've been on stage and stuff seemed to work. 
[02:06:30]  So I'll know who you are there, though.  So you want to go to London a little bit famous before...  Not really.  You can make a name for yourself.  They're 10 years behind us in France.  Remember Leary?  Leary went over there, not famous, and came back, made a name for himself?  Rich Hall.  Rich Hall.  Rich Hall.  He's still huge over there, right?  Yeah, he sells those theaters.  He's massive in London?  Yeah.  He's big as Otis Lee Crenshaw over there now.  He does this singing kind of cowboy dude.  Yeah, he's big.  Get out of here.  He's a household name over there, Rich Hall. 
[02:07:00]  Otis Lee Crenshaw.  He's as big as you can get over there.  Really?  What, is it like a parody of idiotic Americans?  No, he's like a redneck kind of thing, and he sings these songs and parodies, and he's  famous.  Is he kind of like Larry the Cable Guy with songs?  It's Larry Cable Guys, yep.  Yes, it is, yep.  So he just ripped off Larry the Cable Guy.  I won't say that.  Is that the right thing to say?  Say it.  You can say it.  You got a treat for crying.  Man, I like it.  I wouldn't say that, but no, I don't think it's not. 
[02:07:30]  Now you're burning a bridge with...  No, no.  If you listen to this, unless they edit it...  Oh, we'll edit it.  Trust me.  To make it sound like...  I'm saying he does this dude, but I would say it's Cable Guy-ish, but it's not him.  It's just like this...  Yeah.  This, oh, he's more like a...  Like a...  I don't know.  Nigga...  Gitter-dub.  Here's where I get frustrated.  I don't know.  I like that.  I'm just saying.  He's kind of...  Peace for Larry the Cable Guy.  Everybody go to his gig when he's playing New Year's somewhere.  Chris, what was your story of the year? 
[02:08:00]  It's the end of the year here.  What's the one story that made you go, this was a good year?  You know my favorite story, and I'm just sad that they didn't stay on it long enough,  was the astronaut in the diaper was my favorite of the year.  That was my favorite.  Where she is...  Hands down.  She had to do some damage so bad that she needed to wear that diaper for that long ride.  You know, I always say, it's like, that could never happen with a guy.  A guy could put on the diaper, a guy could get in the car.  But he ain't driving 10,000 miles. 
[02:08:30]  A guy, within a mile and a half, he's going to see another girl.  Look at that bitch.  He's going to pull over.  He's not going to make it that long.  Yeah, she was on one of those stalker missions, man.  Oh, she's my favorite.  I'm going to put on a diaper.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And just being an astronaut.  All the work it takes to become an astronaut, and then you just shoot it to hell by putting  a diaper on it. 
[02:09:00]  A diaper in a car.  Having like a bullpen hammer and some pliers.  I don't know what the hell she was going to do.  Some duct tape.  You know how well you have to bang a woman for her to go to the bathroom in her own pants  to get your rival?  Like, you really have to be good and dead.  I think she wanted to be nice and fresh when she saw it.  That was the take.  You actually feel good about that.  You rode all the way here to kill my girl in a diaper?  Thanks, baby.  Oh, that was a great story.  That one is Michael Vick.  Two girls, one cup. 
[02:09:30]  Two girls, one cup is a great one.  What's two girls, one cup?  Oh, Jesus.  We just don't have time, unfortunately.  I wish we had it here.  Wow.  I'm surprised you don't know about it.  It's a video that's just gone completely viral on YouTube, and it's two girls, one cup,  and one girl fills the cup with a lovely thick treat.  Yeah, she could have got it from baggage claim in India.  Yeah.  Two girls, one cup, and India.  Just put those all together. 
[02:10:00]  They both share it.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  It's great.  We're like short timers left in the nom when it comes to that.  We're like the short timers in the nom.  We've seen it so many times, we just watch and go, ha, ha, ha.  But when we get somebody new and that hasn't seen it, we enjoy them just going, oh, I can't  look.  Oh, jeez.  Oh.  But everyone.  On a human level, you can't watch it.  It's just, why are they doing this? 
[02:10:30]  Is this a porno?  No.  I think it was supposed to be in some places of the world.  It did nothing to me at all.  But mainstream culture has checked this video out.  It's not just like guys like us.  Two girls, one cup.  It's so big that they don't have, it's hard to find actual video.  You just have, if you type it up, it's just people watching it.  Yeah.  And you're not seeing it.  Yeah, now it's people's reaction to watching it that people are watching.  Two girls, one cup.  I'll try to remember that.  Yeah.  It's easy.  It's a good one.  It's twogirlsonecup.com.  I've just never, you know. 
[02:11:00]  Do you troll around looking at videos?  I troll around and I never press, you know, S-H-I-T.  Yeah.  I've never been that.  I've never been that.  Oh, Chris, for your viewing pleasure.  Well, here it is.  If you want to take a quick look.  It starts off with a nice scene, girl-on-girl action, and then you get...  Oh, no!  No!  No! 
[02:11:30]  No!  No!  No!  Oh, they do, they have a step-in-up.  Oh, look at that.  Come on, Chris.  They step-in-up.  They step-in-up.  Come on, don't be a rookie.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  What the hell?  Look at that.  Stop!  They really step-in-up.  God, they step-in-up. 
[02:12:00]  That's our favorite part.  Come on, look.  There you go.  There it is.  We just want to make sure you don't forget your time on the Opie and Anthony show.  Two girls, one cup.  Why, indeed.  Why?  You're not going to forget us, right, Chris?  Why?  That was wonderful.  Where do you get those girls?  That makes me breathe better when I see that video.  I think I found a new opening act.  It's an icebreaker, all right? 
[02:12:30]  Well, that's our music.  We've got to get out, unfortunately.  Let's not forget Patrice O'Neill, comics next week.  Comics!  28, 29, 29, yes.  How many seats is that place?  Oh.  Oh.  Patrice O'Neill dot com.  Chris Rock will be there ridiculing me.  Come down and see.  You complain, town hall.  At comics dot com with an X.  Please.  For the Patrice O'Neill info.  Jim.  Is that the Westbury?  Patrice should be at the Westbury Music Show.  Yeah, I'm North Fork on New Year's Eve if you're right out there. 
[02:13:00]  If you're in the city here, Chris Rock is at the Garden on New Year's Eve with Jill.  Jill Scott.  Jill Scott.  And they bring in the New Year there too in the Garden.  Go to Ticketmaster.  And at midnight, Biz Marky's coming out and singing Umbrella.  Biz Marky.  That would be something I would want to see.  Chris Rock.com.  And his greatest hits CD's in stores now.  It's Cheese and Crackers from Chris Rock.  Chris Rock's greatest hits in stores.  Chris, I hope you come back.  We had a lot of fun, man. 
[02:13:30]  This was right.  We do a little hang here.  We try to do it a little different than most shows.  The video was a bit much.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to apologize for that.  How are you going to top that?  Are you going to forget us, though?  I can't forget you.  That's our goal with this whole thing.  All right.  The great Chris Rock.  What else can we say?  Thanks to the audience for a great year, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  We'll all do the hang at Jim Norton's show.  And some will be at the Chris Rock show, obviously.  And then my brothers join FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue after Jim's show in Huntington Village.  We'll all be there.  Hey, guys, thanks for letting me be a part of this. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, whatever.  There you go.  That's good, though.  No, it's not.  I miss filthy, awful.  I don't like this nerd.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  We're going to go over to XM.  And, Chris, it was a pleasure, really.  Thank you.  Oh, I can't be on the cursing show, huh?  You want to go over there?  I've got to go meet some white people.  Lucky you.  That's how we end.  We'll see you guys, I don't know, in about a week or so.  A second or two.  Later, man.  Yeah, all right, man.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Ah, there's our mics.  All right, we're live on the streets of New York City, heading over to XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Couldn't we just run a tape of us doing this before?  Because all I'm going to do is bitch about how cold it is.  We're going to hear listeners try to talk to us while we're doing a radio show, which is always good. 
[02:15:00]  Dude, do you remember that time at the club?  I'm doing a show.  Shut up.  Well, this is the last one of the year.  Yeah.  All right.  To be understanding, this is our last one of the year.  And let's acknowledge the fans that came out today.  Yes.  Lucky for them, it wasn't yesterday.  And they don't have to smell tippy Tom today.  I hope the studio doesn't stink still.  Wow.  It was bad.  I hear you can't even tell we did all that debauchery yesterday.  Good.  By the way, Money Honey on YouTube, check it out.  The videos that Sam put up are pretty damn good. 
[02:15:30]  Pretty proud of those.  How great was Chris' reaction, Chris Rock's reaction to Two Girls?  Oh, that's fantastic.  No, it sucks we didn't film it.  I know.  I know.  It was a quick little thing.  Although someone might have capped it off of Pal Talk.  He was on there, like rolling around on the couch.  What a visceral, great reaction.  Oh, yeah.  He was just screaming, no.  We've been trying to get him on the show for so long.  And he had such a good time.  That was great to see. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  He's always out doing films.  Oh, and did he just nail Patrice?  Yeah.  Oh, he fucking nailed him down perfectly.  He loves Patrice, too.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Patrice could have been the fucking father on that show.  He could have fucking.  He had the fucking job.  But then we wouldn't have Patrice as a regular friend.  I'd rather have him as the failure that he is than have to watch him be successful.  Patrice, if you're listening, the fact that you're a flop makes me feel close to you. 
[02:16:30]  Hey, should we do a little Christmas caroling with the pest today?  Oh, that would be cold.  Yeah.  Well, let's see what they want to sing.  Would you guys like to sing a Christmas song all the way to XF Satellite Radio?  Yeah.  What song would you like to sing?  Christmas shoes.  Christmas shoes.  Who wants to start us off here?  We're going to do some caroling.  I'm cold. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, me too.  Oh.  Yeah, go ahead.  There we go.  There we go.  Start singing.  Why?  How great would a drunk driver be right now?  Right through 57th Street.  Wowing through this crowd.  And that's all you get.  Hey, you guys want to do something called, let's do something called carol raping.  Where everybody knocks on the door and we start to sing.  And when the woman smiles and pulls cookies out, everybody just attacks. 
[02:17:30]  A good carol raping.  And then she'll laugh about it later.  Like, oh, the carol rapist got me.  You guys are going to miss me for the last hour when I'm off getting my surgery.  You do know that.  What?  What are you doing?  That means we all go home.  Well, everyone then misses for the last hour because I'm not going to hang around while  you're having fun getting your eyes done.  So we're not even going to see you with your glasses ever again?  No, this is the last chance to see Jim Norton with his glasses, which is why there's a crowd. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Everybody knew.  Jim's eyes are changing.  It's a big time for the show.  That would be like getting a picture with Hitler after he shaved his mustache.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Or before he grew it in.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing, man?  Hi, sir.  See you soon.  There you go.  Come on upstairs.  Pleasure, pleasure.  We're going to bring everyone upstairs.  We're heading inside.  Let's make this easy.  We'll see you in a few minutes.  You got it?  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:18:30]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  You have seven new voice messages.  First voice message.  Fuck you to the motherfuckers that got into my truck last night and stole my laptop, my digital camera.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give an F.U. to my ex-boy, that red-faced motherfucker.  He caught me a lot of money because he couldn't keep his fucking mouth shut.  Next message.  Hey, yeah, I just wanted to say a big F.U. to my co-worker, Kevin, who all damn day walks around the office going, 
[02:19:00]  My name is William and I like female polish.  Kevin, fuck you.  Next message.  I want to give a big giant fuck you to everybody I work with.  The fucker who says I can't park in front of my own fucking house,  who calls my boss to try and get me in trouble.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give an F.U. to the screener that I just called. 
[02:19:30]  I've got a midget sighting, and not only is it a midget, it's a retard midget in a band full of retards.  He's turned around in the seat, jumped up and down, looking at me like the retard that he is.  Apparently, I riled him up when I gave him a finger.  So your call screeners, F.U.  Next message.  I would like to say a big fuck you to Bob Kelly, who said that we could send him friend requests and he would accept them, 
[02:20:00]  and he would be more than happy to play X-Box.  Well, fuck you.  You haven't accepted any of my invites so far.  Next message.  Fuck you to my ex-wife.  I hope she fucking dies.  End of new messages.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Hi, this is Kevin Smith.  I am Scott Mosier.  And normally in our day jobs, we make movies.  We've made flicks like Clerks and Mallrats. 
[02:20:30]  Jason Amy.  Dogma.  James on Bob Strike Back.  Jersey Girl.  Clerks 2.  But when we're not doing that, we also make a podcast, which we call Smodcast.  Because my last name's Smith.  Mine is Mosier.  Hence Smodcast.  So it's been airing on, well, you know, we put it up every week on QuickStopEntertainment.com,  one of our many websites.  But good folks at O.P. and Anthony and the Virus have asked if they can run them.  So we said, shit, yes. 
[02:21:00]  Shit, put them up, man.  More ears.  Yep.  And it's free.  Although, you know, you pay for XM, so I guess thankfully it's not free.  But, you know, you don't have to pay XM for it.  It's almost free.  It's a fucking gift.  I don't look at a gift towards you in the mouth, but you can listen to it every week here  on 202 on the Virus.  So check out Smodcast right before the Saturday Night Virus at 8 p.m. in the East, 5 p.m.  in the West.  Who the fuck knows what to do around in Canada.  That's Smodcast on XM202, the Virus.  Yeah, yeah, girl.  I want you to say I need your love. 
[02:21:30]  The Virus is spreading.  O.P. and Anthony.  Uh, Marge, Long Island, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Please don't make fun of me.  Why would we be with a name like Marge when you start out like that?  Okay.  How old are you, Marge?  I'm afraid to tell you.  Oh, don't be scared.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let me just say one thing.  Oh, uh-oh.  My belief is that 70 is the new 50.  Hey, you know, God bless. 
[02:22:00]  70 years young, Madge.  70 years young.  God bless, Marge.  But I don't want a birthday party.  What I want you guys to do is to help Little Shelter Adam's Adoption Center.  We need money desperately.  Little, little shelter.  And...  Wait, what kind of pet do you have?  I have a little poodle.  Does he keep you company, does he?  Yeah, it's better than a man at least says he's by my side all the time, and I don't  have to worry that he's straying.  Straying. 
[02:22:30]  A stray dog.  That's funny.  Oh, you're a pit, Marge.  Now, wait a minute.  Now, wait a minute.  Guys, please listen.  All right.  We're listening.  You know there's going to come a day that you're going to be dead in that bed, and your  poodle's going to be nibbling on your arm, right?  Before they find you.  First of all, I'm a very attractive woman, so get off the 70 bitch.  He's going to grab your wig and run around the house because he always hated it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be 70's the new 50.  And I told you not to make fun of me.  That's Opie.  I asked him not to as well.  He's going to be chewing at that leather skin, waiting for your son to show up from Phoenix 
[02:23:00]  to claim the body.  Can I say something, guys?  Hold on, Marge.  We're laughing at your impending death.  Thank you so much.  Will you at least put something in the paper?  Hold on, Marge.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right.  Hold on, Marge.  The dog's not going to have a choice, right?  No.  It's going to eat the food that was left out.  It'll get hungry.  It'll start eating your wig glue.  I should not have said anything about making fun of me.  That was the wrong one.  Maybe licking in between the dentures, hoping for something. 
[02:23:30]  You're probably off to a bad start with the asking not to make fun of you.  Yes.  Yes.  But you're right, though.  50 is the new 70.  Godspeed.  70 is the new 50.  What kind of pets are we trying to save?  We have 360 cats in the cattery.  All right.  There's a cattery.  Wait, what the hell is a cattery?  You have a cattery?  Cattery, and don't make any remarks about that.  What is a cattery?  How can we not make a remark about a cattery?  Okay.  Yeah.  360 that need homes.  Sounds like the things you have on your eyes. 
[02:24:00]  Over a hundred dollars.  I've got to remove my catteries.  But that's not what I'm talking about.  But I want to talk about the cattery.  Yeah.  What names did you go through before you decided cattery was something that wasn't, like, horrible  sounding?  Pussy farm, fall flat.  Was it something that, like, you went through that, but everything sounded a little too much  like cat jail?  Well, it sounded like...  And cattery sounds fun?  I don't want to say on the air.  Marge, Marge, your chances of a stroke are large.  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:24:30]  Why am I doing this?  Perk from Philly.  I don't need to get paid for it.  Can I have two seconds?  Go ahead, Marge.  Talk.  Sure.  So, anyway, well, the first thing is that Little Shelter is having a...  We're selling tickets for a Harley raffle.  Nice.  Look at you.  Right.  And I, when they kept on saying, when we were talking about this, they said, Harley,  Harley, and then they said, bike, bike.  I didn't know what they were talking about, but now I know.  How do you not know what a Harley or a bike is, Marge?  You're very naive. 
[02:25:00]  I thought they were talking about a two-wheeler.  Oh, yeah, and you're used to things with, like, a sidecar.  You know what?  Two wheels, one giant wheel in the front and that little one in the back.  But now I know.  So, here's the deal, guys.  If you want to...  Did you buy your first bike at the Wright Brothers Bicycle Shop?  That's right.  Did a shirtless Negro wheel it over to you without making eye contact?  As well he shouldn't have.  He could have been shot for that.  I'm getting sad.  No, no, no, Marge. 
[02:25:30]  This is a happy, fun show.  Just think about a fire at that animal shelter.  They'll all be so trapped.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:26:00]  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:26:30]  Thank you. 
[02:27:00]  Thank you. 
[02:27:30]  Thank you. 
[02:28:00]  Thank you. 
[02:28:30]  Thank you. 
[02:29:00]  Thank you. 
[02:29:30]  Thank you.  I swore his pee-pee, pee-pee, pee-pee, pee-pee, pee-pee.  Should we talk now?  The great Drew Boogie. 
[02:30:00]  Thank you, sir.  Back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Young Greg is doing some production on the toilet.  Oh, yeah?  Production on the toilet?  I was just in a production studio doing a vocal production out of my mouth, and he's producing  out of his ass.  Is that what you're saying?  I think he is.  He's dropping little Greg pellets.  Pellets.  And, of course, young Patricky.  Yes.  It is our...  Yes, Patrice O'Neill.  Hola.  Always a pleasure.  Always a pleasure here on the XM radio side of our program.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And, yeah, it's the last one before our little Christmas vacation. 
[02:30:30]  Can I get you a little Brazilian friend to come back in again?  Give me a Christmas.  She was in for, like, a fucking week.  Yeah.  She kept coming in.  She wouldn't go away.  She made my knees shake, that little piece of garbage.  She came in, and, yeah, what a fine ass.  I think she's pretty.  Oh, she...  No, she's a...  She is beautifully ugly.  Like, it's like she's so pretty and ugly put together that she's dynamic.  Like, she's just a dynamic little filth ball.  Yeah.  Would you let her sit on your face and put her high on your face? 
[02:31:00]  Why would you even ask that?  Of course.  You might be in a faithful vibe now.  Two girls, one Patrice's face.  You.  Yeah, you were really digging her, man.  She made my knees shake.  She really did.  That was the second horniest time I've ever had in my life.  Because there was a whole slow talker into taking her pants off thing.  And then she covered her little twat with her hands.  Yeah.  Did you see it at all?  No, she covered it.  Like, she pulled them down and then covered them with her hands.  And you just see this small, meaty ass. 
[02:31:30]  And that...  I think she was the second...  I mean, I've been horny, but I mean, where you go,  Oh, God, I gotta...  You gotta put your face in ice cold water.  And the first horniest time ever, like, where...  You know, you ever been rapey?  Yes.  Rapey?  Like, where you just go, God help me not rape.  Yep.  And it was this fucking beautiful girl in England.  Just...  She walked out of a club.  She was a model.  Had to be.  Staggering out of a club and just pulled her pants down, 
[02:32:00]  squatted and pissed in the middle of the street,  and stood back up and walked away.  I almost fainted in the gutter.  I almost passed out.  Was it the animalistic thing about the whole thing?  It was so...  I jerked off seven times, and it still didn't...  Wow.  Take care of the...  It didn't get the evil out.  I just had to sleep.  What the fuck is so, like...  I like the wolf man.  You know the wolf man locks himself in?  Yeah, yeah.  No matter what you hear, don't open this door. 
[02:32:30]  I had to give somebody a gun.  If I come out of this room, shoot me.  And this girl, this Brazilian girl,  had to be just in terms of a...  To hit me in terms of horniness in the top.  Wow.  It had to be the second.  She was such a little hot thing with that...  Just that...  I don't know.  I don't want to say ugly, because that's so...  No, she's not ugly.  She's very pretty.  Ugly is not the word.  It's like she's just a strange-looking little sexy thing.  There's something called funny-looking cute. 
[02:33:00]  That's what she is.  That is...  Yes, yes.  That can sometimes surpass hot.  Because she's hot, but she's oddly beautiful.  Yeah, I know she is.  Yes, that's a great...  Not even oddly beautiful.  Yeah, oddly beautiful falls into the category,  but there's funny-looking cute,  which is a weird thing.  Like, on first inspection...  I think Charlize Theron is that face.  Really?  Like a face of...  Yeah, I think she's like...  It's pretty hot, man.  She's considered, like, hot and beautiful 
[02:33:30]  and classically beautiful kind of shit.  If you look at her...  You know...  Wait, how about Ashley Judd?  I consider them, like, twins.  Like, if you just look at her, like...  They're interchangeable, the two of them.  This girl, this Brazilian girl, that...  I'm trying to think of a good example of funny-looking cute...  I don't know.  If she squeezed your cock, you think you would have come?  If she would have tugged it a little bit?  I ignored her.  I did that fake ignore on her.  Oh, shit.  I didn't have the mic on.  Isn't that cute?  There we go.  I had to fake ignore her.  Like, I had to be above how cute she was. 
[02:34:00]  Like, when she pulled her little pants down  and that small, meaty booty...  You could see the meat.  You could see how it was a meaty little booty.  And she covered her twat up with her hand.  It made me sick.  My stomach was turning.  Like, I was like, oh, you fucking dirty...  Like, I would risk my relationship  if my girl, listen already,  and just stick my face right in that asshole.  Really?  Because that's how I am now.  Immediately, it's asshole.  Like, if I see a beautiful girl,  it's no more pussy.  I'm just...  It's asshole. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, I want to put my face right in her asshole.  There's no more vagina.  The vagina has too much humanity attached to it.  You just want the filthiest of holes.  It's just wherever the stinkiest mess is.  That's where your face is.  Where are you going to go from asshole, though?  It doesn't matter.  Internal organs.  Back to space.  Yeah.  Just...  Trace holes.  Just in case she wakes up.  I always go for the dirtiest.  Right to the trace hole.  I always go for the dirtiest  just in case she comes out of her...  Whatever her coma-like state is 
[02:35:00]  that made me want to let me...  Yeah.  Like, fuck with her.  I go dirty first,  and then I go, okay,  I'll do the regular stuff,  but I'm going straight to fucking...  Wow, man.  Yeah, that girl,  that particular girl,  straight to asshole.  Yeah.  Straight.  Not even...  Not even a smell test.  That's...  That's interesting.  She could have wrestled an alligator  and came from roller skating  at the same time.  That's true.  There are, like,  certain...  And I guess that's what you...  Rapey.  When you say rapey.  I had a hitchhike...  You're feeling rapey.  Yeah, like, I don't see... 
[02:35:30]  That's what I'm saying,  but you know how people  take shit out of context?  Oh, my God!  It's like you feel like,  oh, my God,  nothing can soothe  what just happened to me.  You should say, yeah,  you feel like a caveman.  Wow.  What does that mean?  Hitting a bitch with a log  and dragging it by a hand?  You might as well  update it to rapey.  I know, but...  But, say it,  I feel like a caveman  will save you  and you'll get  the next Chris Rock project,  you idiot. 
[02:36:00]  I'm just trying  to help you out still.  But, you know...  You go animalistic.  You just go down  to that real primal level.  She still didn't beat  that fucking girl,  that white girl in England  that just squatted...  That squatted and pissed?  And took a laser beam piss,  like, you can...  Like, a plasma  cutter cutting through  like a fucking lifesaver  it was coming out.  Like, it was straight  and it didn't curve  until she stopped.  Like, it just...  And I'm just...  She just looking  straight ahead  and got up  and then staggered away 
[02:36:30]  almost like some weird nightmare.  Was it the animalistic thing about...  What was it about that scene  that just stood out  and made it so hot?  I talked to fucking Norton  about it years ago  because it's still...  To this day,  it made me crazy.  He just goes,  it's a naughtiness, I guess.  And that's why  two girls, one cup  never...  It just didn't bother me.  I enjoy seeing  beautiful women just do...  It makes me feel better  about myself.  It just goes...  When you see a beautiful woman  in the street,  you just think to yourself,  two girls, one cup.  Because you just go, 
[02:37:00]  this is the reason  why men hate women  is that video.  It's just like,  you mean I'm doing  all of this, man?  All of this I'm doing  to find out  that you shit in a cup?  I'm doing all of this?  Really?  Are you serious?  I don't think all women  have the capacity  to do the two-girl-one cup.  They certainly do.  That's what they should be doing.  I'm trying to succeed  in the business world.  Grab a cup  and make a movie,  you fucking horse.  It just didn't bother me  when I saw that thing  just because I understood  there's a psychology behind it  and it was just like, 
[02:37:30]  oh.  And that girl,  they will...  If you see those girls  walking on the street,  you'll just be...  You'll go,  oh my God.  One girl had legs  like a superhero, man.  She had legs  like you draw  in a comic book,  Wonder Woman superhero legs.  Yeah.  And she's just sitting there  sticking her whole hand  down her throat,  throwing up on another broad.  And that itself  is disgusting,  but the context of it  is beautiful.  It's just a...  It helps men  not do bad things  just to see this girl  open her ass 
[02:38:00]  and shit in a cup.  No, he's right.  I had one time  years ago  picked up this hitchhiker.  She needed beer money.  I was 19.  She was maybe...  This doesn't stop well.  I was 19.  She was like 30.  Wait a minute.  You didn't kill a girl.  Oh, no.  No.  But she needed beer money,  so I bought her  a couple six-packs  and we were talking  and she was flirting with me  and she looked at my...  I was so horny  and she looked at my cock  through my jeans  I had a hard-on 
[02:38:30]  and she's like,  nah, I can't do anything.  I gotta go home.  And she's like,  ah, really, it looks nice.  And she squeezed it  a little bit  through my jeans.  She's like,  I got a nice cock.  And I understood  what it would be like  to attack somebody.  I felt...  That's a great word,  Patrice,  had rapey.  I could have raped her,  but it wasn't the violence of rape.  It was the sexual...  It was the sexual angle  of when someone sexually assaults you.  Right.  It wasn't like  power over you.  It was just like...  Please let me come.  I can't have you.  Please let me come.  Hey, laser beam piss girl, 
[02:39:00]  can I please  fuck you, please?  And you just know  it's not gonna happen?  Would you just go...  If she pissed  and then had bent over the cup  and then bent over the car  and then put her ass out  and said,  come wipe me,  would you have come  and put your mouth on a pussy?  I'd have did the Puerto Rican cross  over my body.  I'd have did the Catholic cross  and just said,  God, I wouldn't know.  Like now,  there's nothing  that a girl could do filthy  that would make me go,  like if a girl,  I would know what to do.  Come wipe my ass. 
[02:39:30]  No problem.  Ass down to the vagina.  I know how to do that,  baby girl.  Or ass,  or no,  vagina up to ass.  Clit to fucking spine  back to clit.  I would know how to do it.  Like I know how to choke chicks  and shit.  I know how to,  I know how to do anything  I need to do.  You know all the filth.  Yeah,  like people go,  I talk to a girl  about spitting in the face  and they just like,  ew,  but I know how to do it.  It's just,  I know how to do it.  There's no more  uncharted territory for you.  You are fucking,  you've mapped out  the entire world 
[02:40:00]  of perversity.  Nothing trips me out.  And there's no new land  for you.  No new frontier of filth.  I know what I don't like.  I don't like human shit  is despicable.  See,  the thing I can watch  that two girls thing  is because there's no smell.  Human shit is just horrid.  Yeah.  So I know I'm not into that.  We know,  we smelled it yesterday.  It's just,  oh,  holy shit.  And I'm not into that  and I'm also not into  being tied up.  But I'll tie a bitch up  in a minute.  Yeah?  Yeah,  I'll tie a chick up  in a minute.  Hey,  can I stop it for a sec though?  We didn't get to the end  of Jim's story.  Why didn't she blow you? 
[02:40:30]  She said she had a guy  she couldn't,  a boyfriend.  And she's like,  yeah,  I can't,  I just can't.  I just can't.  And I knew she wouldn't.  I understood that  the encounter was over  unless I did something bad.  So I just dropped her up  and drove away.  That's how you knew  it was the end  because you can feel  right when you get rapey  is that  the rapey part was  that you ain't getting it.  Oh,  it looks so juicy  but I can't  and you just start shaking  because you know she won't.  You never felt rapey  in your life?  No,  I never had it  put in that context. 
[02:41:00]  All right,  put it out of,  I can check it out of.  there have been,  you know,  dry humping nights  that just,  you know,  you leave with blue balls  and fucking,  looks like you rubbed  your dick on a cheese grater  all night.  Yeah,  that would,  you start feeling rapey.  You ever ask a girl,  please?  Have you ever said  please for pussy?  I don't think  I've ever said please.  In your life  have you ever said please?  No,  I beg of you.  Please,  please,  you don't understand.  I've never done  the typical guy lines 
[02:41:30]  of like,  you know,  you don't understand,  I need this  and oh,  if you were into me,  we'd do this  or if you're,  you know,  any of that bullshit.  Well,  if you start losing your,  see,  what happened is  I started losing this thing  where jerking off  was being defeated.  As soon as I discovered  how much I enjoy jerking off  and how little,  pussy did mean.  Like,  the act of it  and sticking it in  is not as big as like,  I'll jerk off  in fucking a second  if a bitch plays  the pussy game. 
[02:42:00]  But like I said,  the ones that fucked me up,  like that Brazilian girl,  jerking off probably  wouldn't have,  I ignored her  at the end of the day,  like I just got her  out of my head  because jerking off  wouldn't have helped  with this little thing  just covering her twat  with her hand.  Right,  right.  I had a massage therapist  one time rubbing me  and she had a pair  of like loose cloth shorts on.  She was kind of  getting a little nasty  and I'm on my back  and I asked her,  I wanted to feel her ass  so I asked her  to put her ass by my face  so she straddled my face  and when she opened her legs  the cloth part  of her shorts came aside 
[02:42:30]  and I saw her pussy lips  and they were fucking fat  and massive.  It looked like,  you ever see a caricature  where the fucking head  is so much bigger  than,  it looked like a caricature pussy.  It didn't look like a human.  How horny was you?  I can't describe,  I wanted to bite.  Again,  I wanted to devour her somehow.  I was that excited.  I literally,  I wound up giving her $600  because I got so crazy.  She wouldn't do anything. 
[02:43:00]  She wouldn't let me lick it.  I didn't know how to play  at that time.  You just gave her $600  and with a wink like,  come on,  you know what it's all about.  I kept giving her money  and she was so good at the game  that I wound up getting nothing  and I wound up jerking off.  In front of her?  What was the most?  No, when she left.  Holy shit,  you gave her $600?  Wait, wait,  did it ever get past  just taking a peek?  Eventually I fucked her.  Not that night,  but eventually I fucked her.  Was it as good  as the build up?  Was it as good  as this story?  And now that girl 
[02:43:30]  is my wife.  That's right.  No, she,  I saw her.  So I married her.  That's years ago.  I saw her a lot of times  after that  and eventually  I started licking  that big,  beautiful,  meaty,  fat pussy.  Yeah?  Um, yeah.  Was the build up worth all?  Yeah, it was huge.  It was a big pussy.  That was a big,  fat pussy, man.  It drove me,  it was visceral.  I think,  you see,  that's the odd thing.  Big fat bulge.  I think Jimmy still  has that thing  with the filth 
[02:44:00]  or whatever he's into  that you kind of lost.  You don't seem to really get  excitement anymore  out of it.  It's like a chore.  Gotta go back  to the day he came in here  with his glass dildos.  We had a moment.  Remember the moment  with the glass dildos  where we looked at you?  And he looked at me  and just was like,  what are you doing?  Are you alright, man?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And something did happen  to him at that time.  Like, the other day,  I was trying to,  you know,  we were trying to hook back up  with the little threesome  and she got girly.  I don't know what happened, 
[02:44:30]  but she's not,  she just disappeared.  So I, you know.  Wow, that's an update.  Yeah, she just, like.  Did Jimmy hear about that?  The ultimate threesome  he got for his birthday?  Oh, yeah,  the threesome I had  for my birthday.  Oh, and you were,  you were trying to get  that to happen again.  Again.  And now here's the update.  And she just.  Who's she?  Your girl or the other girl?  My girl, well, you know,  you gotta have your girl do it,  so I'm talking to my girl  to talk to her  and she won't,  she just won't call my girl  back in there.  But this girl was a soldier.  Just a fucking. 
[02:45:00]  How'd you know her?  Was she a.  I met her.  I just met her.  Okay.  And then talked to her  about my birthday  and talked to her  and then she just ended up  being a bisexual.  Took her home one night  and it was the best threesome  I ever had  and we didn't even fuck her.  Like, she was on a period.  We didn't even fuck her.  She was a tremendous  because she,  the thing that made it tremendous  is she fucked me,  she fucked us.  Yeah.  She didn't fuck me  and she didn't fuck,  she just,  wherever there was an opening,  she would go,  okay, I'll go there. 
[02:45:30]  She just hovered,  she was a perfect threesome girl  because she just hovered  anywhere she can be in,  she would go there.  Oh, there's a spot there  under your arm,  there's her titty  and there's your elbow.  I'm gonna get right  in that motherfucker right there.  And she just.  Does your girl like it?  Yeah, she likes it  but she gets a little,  she saw what a little tramp  this girl was  and her mind  couldn't just be free  because this girl  was licking my girl's ass  and I was licking  my girl's pussy  and my girl, 
[02:46:00]  I go,  how can you not enjoy it  because she's just sitting there  and then me and the girl  did some weird,  I couldn't even help it.  This is the thing  where you couldn't,  we were kissing  and eating my girl's pussy  at the same time.  I couldn't have,  I couldn't pass up.  I was like,  relationship  or tongue kiss this girl  and eat my girl's pussy  at the same time.  Take the tongue kiss.  Fuck it.  Girlfriends are replaceable.  Jesus.  That scenario is not. 
[02:46:30]  And then she,  I don't want to speculate  because I never ask why  but I don't know  what the fuck,  it caused me pain  that she disappeared.  Yeah, huh?  But at least you had it once though.  Oh, that's,  she came through  like an animal.  Speaking of what you,  Wow, it sounded like  it was going to be  one of those things  that you might revisit.  This is what I,  fucking girls are so,  fucking they're assholes.  No guy would,  no guy would go,  I don't,  I go,  sweetie,  why wouldn't you want  to get your asshole?  A guy would be waiting 
[02:47:00]  by the phone  for it to ring.  Here's the thing,  she jilted us.  This is what happened.  Jilted.  And she was supposed  to come out one Friday  and what happened is  I had everything planned out.  I went into my old,  I have a trunk in the house.  Oh, shit.  And it's,  you know,  it's like the gimp trunk,  you know,  you go in there  and there's some shit in there.  And I was dusting off shit.  Like,  I ain't shit.  Oh, wow.  You know,  your fucking girl,  your girl's not an object no more.  You know,  she's not really an object  like she used to be.  She's my girl.  She's not taboo.  I just go,  take your goddamn clothes off,  asshole.  She goes, 
[02:47:30]  eat my pussy,  nigga.  You know,  that's,  I want my pussy to eat,  motherfucker.  You were bringing stuff  out of retirement.  Yeah,  I was.  Dusting it off.  I had it all laid out.  I got this.  Hello,  old friend.  Like this long black thing,  like the bondage shit  and all that  because this girl was into  just all type of shit.  I had a mask  to put on  a fucking head  and all that.  Wow.  So,  I was.  You were gonna fucking.  Yeah,  we was gonna fucking really.  That's what happened.  You planned it out too much.  Got all worked up  and frothy.  And then you forgot.  You got fucked.  You got.  You got. 
[02:48:00]  You got to scream.  Just turn my head.  You got the carrot top  trunk of sex toys,  man.  I want to know  what else is in this thing.  I tried to do it.  I got to say,  I love my girl  for being this much  of a trooper.  I tried to replace  what I was gonna do  just with her,  but I tied her up  and she was trying  to work with me  to be as,  you know,  she was being extra dirty.  Yeah.  And I just go.  She gave it  the old college try  for you.  Wait a minute.  I'm so sweet. 
[02:48:30]  I love you,  but I don't want you.  I want to choke  this new bitch.  I don't want this call  to go away.  We got Tim in Kentucky.  Tim, go ahead.  The phrase of the year  has to come  from Patrice's  three-way there  where he said last time  that she was fighting  for dick space.  Fighting for dick space.  Right, the girl,  because the girl,  what happened is  my girl,  when she came out  of the bathroom,  I just go,  sweetie,  come out of the bathroom  with no clothes on. 
[02:49:00]  And the other girl,  I go, look,  take your clothes off.  She's like,  I don't understand  how she could not  come back  because she was  just so perfect.  She goes,  is she going to be mad  if I'm naked  when you come out?  Bitch,  take that off.  She takes it off  just like a soldier.  My girl comes out naked.  She comes out,  sits down.  My girl pulls my dick out.  This chick pops  right on my dick.  I was saying,  you ever see Darkman  when they killed him  and that fucking bird  that hit the lighter 
[02:49:30]  to blow Darkman up?  That's how fucking  she went down  on my dick.  And she's sucking it  and my girl  is looking at this girl.  She's looking at this girl  going,  we look at each other  going,  oh shit,  because we've done  a few threesomes  but this bitch  was a soul.  And she was looking  at each other  and my girl was like,  well, fuck that.  This young piece of garbage  ain't coming in  and taking my title.  So she just goes down.  She stops looking at my balls  so this girl  is sucking my dick 
[02:50:00]  and this other girl  is looking at my balls  and then the girl  kind of stops to go,  no, I'm not,  I don't want to fight you  for dick space.  I'll just go behind you,  sweetie,  and lick your asshole.  And my girl  is sucking my dick  going,  oh my God,  what have I done?  Because I'm sitting there  like,  yes!  Were you playing  with your nipples?  Oh, man.  Listen to Jimmy.  I tried to be  touching yourself,  by the way.  I tried to be as dirty.  I'm almost filled up.  I tried to be  as dirty as possible  but at the same time  I'm trying to 
[02:50:30]  not piss my girl off.  Yeah, of course.  So I'm kind of enjoying it  but then I said,  fuck that,  I have to enjoy this  because that's when  the kissing came in  was just,  the kissing is what  happened  because this chick,  for a girl to be  that submissive  to lick your girl's asshole  and then we're just  both on her twat,  she's licking her asshole  and I'm licking her twat,  then we reverse  and then we're both  on her twat  and my girl's  just sitting there  going,  she's going to  take my man  not enjoying  two people  licking,  that's what  You and her 
[02:51:00]  were bonding  over your girl's pussy.  You were bonding  over her.  Do you think  that your girl  really called her?  I scream again,  Patrice,  it's okay.  They feel your pain  out there.  Oh, god damn  and she just,  I don't know,  she's just gone now.  Do you think  your girl  really called her?  Or do you think  that your girl  really called her?  Nah, she,  no, she,  my girlfriend,  god damn it,  god love her,  she,  when it comes to this shit,  she might have  her little problems  after or, 
[02:51:30]  she gets girly,  but she is a  fucking trooper.  I've seen her in action.  She don't fuck around.  And that's why  I don't go to  swing clubs anymore,  by the way.  Why?  Because I bring  a god damn  gunslinger.  Doc,  holiday, baby.  When I go to  a motherfucking  swing club,  I bring Doc  holiday with me.  What?  You want me to  kill who, sweetie?  This motherfucking  Natmo,  fall out!  What's that shit  from Toonstone?  I'll be your  Huckleberry,  that's my girl.  And these motherfuckers 
[02:52:00]  come there with  these,  this,  this,  this plan  to take  Fatboy's girl  and not let me  touch his girl.  I'm like,  nah, man.  Really?  Oh, you've had that?  Nah.  Huh?  You've had that?  Oh, yeah,  we swung, man,  and, and,  and we,  our first swinging  experience was good.  The,  the third one is like,  guys are trying to  figure out how to  fuck my girl  and his girl  and push me out.  I never do that.  How do you try to  push you out?  I bring,  I kind of,  fucking with this girl  and like,  trying to ignore me  and my girl's looking  at me and I'm looking 
[02:52:30]  at him like,  you don't,  you don't even know  motherfucker,  like,  why are you fucking  up the etiquette?  I bring a soldier  and you,  and you playing around  trying to be a pimp,  you fucking idiot.  You can't be a pimp  at a swing club.  This is a lifestyle,  you asshole.  You trying to take  my girl,  go ahead,  do your thing.  My girl,  get up.  What'd you do?  Nothing.  Just,  I get up,  I sit there  and I let him  think he's gonna,  and he's all rough  and all fucked up,  but the best way  to do it is,  it's like,  you go,  some,  the first time I did it,  the dude was very,  very gentle with my chick 
[02:53:00]  and she liked him  and I'm like,  good,  because I'm gonna be  very gentle with his chick.  I don't get that.  I couldn't sit by  and watch that shit.  So wait,  the third guy  was fucking trying to,  bizarre.  He was just trying  to get a threesome  at my expense  and he don't know,  I trained a goddamn  specialist.  How did it end?  She's special ops.  She's special ops.  She's not fucking  going around,  she's not gonna,  she's not a trader,  she's not gonna give up  government secrets. 
[02:53:30]  How did it end?  What?  He left  because I had to explain  to him,  you know,  stop trying to be a pimp.  Did you say that?  Yeah.  Good.  Stop trying to be smooth,  stupid.  It's like guys  that go to Brazil  and try to be a pimp.  What,  are you an asshole?  It's a world of hookers.  Don't stop,  this is where you're,  you cannot have to be cool.  Are you,  are you worried  your girl will leave you  for one of these guys?  Nah.  Not at all?  Not even a little bit?  Come on.  Not even a little bit.  Let's get that hard shell.  Let's get inside 
[02:54:00]  that hard shell a little bit.  I'm gonna,  Chris Rock started this today.  I'm gonna be as,  as humble as I possibly can.  Not,  not at all.  Go ahead,  sorry.  It's only because  if you find a woman,  this is what,  this is the thing  why you have to  filth your girl out  and be,  let her be free as possible.  I let my girl know,  I have long conversations  with her.  Giving away pussy  for a woman  is so unfulfilling.  Going to get other dick  is not even cheating on you.  It's like,  your woman can go  and go fuck 20 guys. 
[02:54:30]  It's unfulfilling.  The difference is,  I'm chasing pussy.  I'm trying to get  that real estate.  She's giving real estate away.  So if she sees  some other dude  with a better dick,  fuck this shit out of her,  sweetie.  Go ahead,  get her,  tiger.  Fuck her.  Then one day  she's gonna be sitting there  and become a girl.  What's this all about?  Then she gotta come see me  and I'll tell you  what it's all about,  bitch.  You're goofy.  I'll tell the bitch  she's goofy.  You're insane, man.  You think that's what  happened with you?  Drew,  you're not on.  Sorry about that. 
[02:55:00]  You think that's what  happened with your,  your new threesome  girl?  She got goofy  and went back to some guy?  Yeah.  She probably has a boyfriend.  She probably just,  she probably was like  addicted to something  that she didn't want  to be a dick.  Girl,  because girls run from  shit that makes  them feel good.  This is just,  especially if they're driven.  It's like,  this will make me  fail math  so I can't,  you dumb bitch,  eat a ball.  Put this ball  in your mouth.  What happened to me  when you called  the guy a pimp?  You told the guy  stop being a pimp.  What happened?  I never heard that. 
[02:55:30]  He got his girl,  he said,  yo,  yo,  alright man,  I'm out.  You know,  because he was trying  to pimp my girl.  He's trying to whisper  in her ear.  And his girl,  here's the fucking thing,  I'm being very,  like,  soft with his girl.  See,  this is the thing,  giant dick man  can't beat me.  I'll find a place.  Giant dick man.  Like,  did he have a giant dick?  I think he did  because he pulled out  like half of it.  He didn't even pull it all out  and it was bigger than my dick  so that,  yeah,  he's a giant dick. 
[02:56:00]  So it's like,  it's like you,  what happens is  he's trying to go  blah, blah, blah  and I'm trying to touch his girl  and he trained her  not to be a soldier.  You understand?  He trained her  to play a motherfucker out.  I trained my girl,  you get more  if you sell that motherfucker  the dream he's looking for.  Go get him, tiger!  What was his girl doing  while you were touching her?  She,  looking at him  and they were trying to do it  and I would just sit back  and I'll go,  I don't even need to look  at my girl  because the only thing  she looks for 
[02:56:30]  is if a guy's  hurting her,  like meaning,  you know,  he's,  the motherfucker's  getting too crazy,  squeezing her tits too hard  and you go,  and then she goes,  she goes,  and you gotta go,  dude,  you see she's not really,  you know.  She's not into that.  She's not.  Does that make you angry?  He's like,  nah,  I don't get,  you don't get crazy.  Aren't you bringing  the hottest girl  into those places too?  My girl would be,  Your girl is hot, man.  She's a looker.  I'm imagining  there's a lot of messes  in those places. 
[02:57:00]  There'll be a lot  of old white couples  that you want to  just drop kick,  but it's like,  she,  I fuck up,  I bring our property value down,  like in terms of  hot couple,  like you know,  if you see on the internet,  hot couple 26,  it's like,  I'm not part of the hot,  my girl is the selling point  of that game,  but I walk her through it  and the thing is,  you talk about girls leaving,  who the fuck  is she gonna leave me for?  And this is not  an arrogant statement.  Who the fuck  is she gonna leave me for  that would allow her 
[02:57:30]  to pee on a motherfucker,  swing,  eat some other pussy,  spit in a nigga's face?  Who the fuck  is she gonna go  do that for?  And that's,  and it's the same thing,  who the fuck,  I gotta go retrain a bitch?  I'm a general.  I can't,  I can't,  my girl is a lieutenant,  I don't wanna go back  to basic training  and go try to talk  some bitch  through having a threesome  and convince her  why it's good?  Wow.  Let's go to John of Missouri.  John, what's up?  You are in deep then.  Johnny. 
[02:58:00]  A lot invested.  Hey.  Hey, this is Todd.  Oh, okay.  Whatever.  Todd from Missouri,  what's up?  Just you, sir.  Hey, um,  Patrice brings up  a lot of good points.  My wife and I,  we're in the lifestyle  and, uh,  I love that.  We're in the lifestyle.  It's a lifestyle.  We're in the lifestyle.  It is a lifestyle.  Please, respect it.  All right.  It's such a vague thing  for we like fucking other people.  And why the fuck,  excuse me, dude,  before you finish this,  why is being gay  more acceptable  in this fucking country  than swinging?  Because you gotta get 
[02:58:30]  the political, like,  party together or something.  You gotta get politically active  with this lifestyle.  Why is two?  Excellent point.  Thank you.  You don't have  I'm a swinging American  people.  Right, right.  That's all it is.  You gotta get your parade going.  There's a lot of things  you gotta do.  I was born this way.  Oh.  I was born,  I want insurance.  I don't think  that's gonna wash.  I want health insurance  because I like  sleeping with two bitches.  Part of the benefits  for my five friends.  Todd.  Sorry, man.  Go ahead, Todd.  That's all right.  Anyways, Opie,  you had said something about 
[02:59:00]  aren't you worried  about your girl leaving you?  I think a lot of people  that don't practice  this kind of a lifestyle  don't realize  that it's not about  feelings  and it's not about  worrying about  if your spouse  or your girl  is gonna leave you.  It's just about sex  and that's all it is.  It's sex.  I couldn't do it.  And I think she's,  I think I get turned on  by her so much more  after we do that shit.  I love my girl again.  Like sometimes  you just get that,  like I always say  about like men, 
[02:59:30]  like you ever been  with a man,  like ladies that have  been with a man  and have you ever  been with a man?  Like I'm just talking  to women really  and you know,  and women,  ask that woman  is she be with a guy  and she goes,  this motherfucker  acts like he on his period.  Like he's acting  like I act monthly  but what that is  is men have a period  and it's called  being faithful  for long periods of time.  If you don't get  side pussy for a long time  you get the same  like symptoms  as a bitch on a period.  You get sick,  you get nauseous,  you get fucked, 
[03:00:00]  you gotta take pills.  You found something here.  You really gotta write a book  and throw all this in a book.  I'm telling you.  It'd be a great read.  I would do.  Because you're like,  you think like nobody.  No one else I've ever heard  in my life  is what he thinks like.  She gets turd.  I just attach myself  to my feelings  and I understand it.  It's just like  she gets so much  I forget how sad.  Like I didn't have to ruin  my relationship  to get different pussy.  That's what a three is, man.  This is your thing though.  Go get a book deal. 
[03:00:30]  I'm telling you.  I can't read this.  I can hazard a guess  as to why Patrice's girl  won't leave him  because,  and tell me if I'm wrong,  because, you know,  she's with a general now.  If she leaves you,  she might find out  that the next guy  is a cadet.  And then she has to  train him  and she don't want to do that.  I have to tell her  all the time,  fight them,  don't fight me.  You know what I'm saying?  Fight the,  like after a while,  a karate instructor,  he don't instruct  his best fucking student  no more.  That student instructs others.  And the best student 
[03:01:00]  comes and gets a cup.  Like I was like,  bitch,  stop trying to fight me  all the time.  Go out there  and go get them.  Wait,  have you ever seen your,  this is what would bother me.  Like,  have you ever watched  your girl,  because me and Florentine  one time years ago  picked up two girls.  Yeah.  And I couldn't get an erection.  I was laying there humiliated  and Jim was fucking  this girl well.  He was fucking  her brains out.  God,  he has great fuck stories.  Florentine,  shit.  Florentine was fucking  this girl like a professional.  And I thought to myself,  if you ever let him  fuck your girlfriend,  you're finished.  I've seen it. 
[03:01:30]  And then she'll see  me afterwards  and feel like,  ugh.  I've seen it, dude.  I've seen it.  I've seen a guy  with better prowess  than me going at it.  With your girl?  And she attaches,  girls don't go,  I need more dick.  I want all kinds of dick.  They pretend they do  by calling it  nymphomania and all,  but they don't,  girls want to fuck  one guy a lot.  They don't want to fuck  a lot of guys once.  We want to fuck  a lot of women  once.  And every woman. 
[03:02:00]  Getting some reactions  out there, my friend.  Girls don't go,  give me more dick.  Because there's no  challenge to a bitch  just saying,  fuck me,  here's pussy.  It's not,  it's nothing to them.  You're saying,  because there'd be a line  just waiting to get in there.  Who's she going to give,  my girl's going to get  revenge on me  by giving away  her fucking twat?  Good luck to you.  Low self-esteem,  it's not going to  fucking happen.  No, we should do,  we got a huge audience  today on the bleachers.  Anybody have a question  for Patrice  and his ways 
[03:02:30]  of thinking?  Anybody in a situation  they need a little advice?  God,  you're online.  Right.  Anybody out there  want to ask Patrice  a question about  relationships,  sex in general?  It's just not even.  You just have a way  about you  when it comes to this stuff.  Yeah, let's see  if anybody's got anything.  Anybody?  They call it misogyny,  but it's just not.  Girls just don't  want to be with a guy  that they have to run.  Well, let's see.  Anybody want to...  Do you mind  coming over here? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, you're putting  them on the spot.  They might have to  think about the questions  a little bit.  We got a couple.  You could use a fake name  or whatever.  We don't give a shit.  Here's a young lad.  Patrice, how you doing,  mate?  How are you?  First of all,  your problem is  you're not circumcised.  That's all right.  He's our friend  from Down Under.  Yeah, man.  You do the walkover  like once, twice a year,  right?  Yeah, I just got here  yesterday.  You're back in the States  again.  I remember you.  I was going to ask Patrice,  how do you bring up  eating arsehole  with your girlfriend?  How do you just 
[03:03:30]  bring that into her?  You don't bring up nothing.  There's no way you can  ask your girl  to do anything sexual  and she goes,  okay, practice saying  to yourself,  hey, can I lick  your arsehole?  She has to say  fucking no.  So what you do  is you lick every...  You just do  arsehole-y things.  First of all,  any bitch  who doesn't want  her arsehole licked  is an arsehole.  Like, that's not  fucking her in the arse.  Licking her arse  is such a pleasurable thing.  You just do it.  That's one of those things  you just do. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, but these are  average guys  that they don't have  to game like you,  so you gotta give them  something.  When you're eating a pussy,  eat a pussy from behind  doggy style  and stick your face in it  and do arsehole-y things.  Like, if you're licking  a pussy from doggy style,  arsehole-y things.  Have your nose  near her arsehole  breathing hot air  nose air  on her arsehole  and she'll feel  and then she'll just  want something.  It's just like  how you get the girl  to spit?  You just introduce 
[03:04:30]  spitting somehow.  Like, you tell her  oh, just spit on it  and she'll do  the girl two-y  but you just  spit now exists.  It's there.  So you do things  around her arsehole  and then  arsehole is  in the picture.  How do you do  anything without  arsehole being  in the picture anyway?  If you're  fucking with the pussy,  that's your fault.  So you just gotta  introduce it into  your life.  You just do it.  Maybe turn all the  chairs in your apartment  upside down.  Just something. 
[03:05:00]  Eat a lot of mushrooms.  Just somehow  introduce it into your  day-to-day life.  No girl,  they wanna be  tricked into being whores.  You cannot  ask a girl  can I  do anything?  Because first of all,  she's gonna go,  this fucking faggot  asking me shit.  Asking can I?  No, that's like  pulling a hair.  It has to be animal  because half the shit  all a girl would do  up to her  is lay on her back.  This is another reason  why my girl  and again, 
[03:05:30]  I don't wanna say this  in the air  because she can leave  but she's like,  some guy  goes,  can I pull your hair  beautiful?  She'll go,  you faggot  motherfucker.  Punch me in the face.  She would have to get  because see,  as a man,  as a man,  I can get any woman  to do anything disgusting  because that's my thing  is,  my thing is manipulation.  Girls cannot  figure out a way  to get a guy  to lick her asshole  when her ex-boyfriend 
[03:06:00]  did it.  She got no,  there's no technique  to going,  listen,  my ex-boyfriend  used to like  shove his balls  in my mouth  so I couldn't breathe.  Is it possible  you can do that  uncircumcised cock?  Alright.  Anybody else  have a question  out there?  Anyone else?  Anybody else  brave enough  to ask Patrice  a sex question?  Here we go.  What's up, guys?  Hi.  Well, Patrice,  my girlfriend 
[03:06:30]  hasn't gone down  on me in like  three years.  How do I get her  to start doing it again?  You really...  Oh, boy.  First of all,  let the audience  laugh at you.  Wow.  It is Point of Laugh Friday  so here's a great  opportunity.  You want her  to suck your dick?  Make her convert  from Judaism.  You know what it is?  Without just saying  fucking leave her,  what you do  is you step  your sex game up  to such a level  and don't ask  for nothing from her, 
[03:07:00]  she'll get competitive  because she'll go,  I don't want him  to leave me  and go do these things  he's doing to me  to some other broad.  What you do  is have an ethic  about how you make  her cum without  asking anything.  So you eat her pussy.  Whatever she do,  you make her lose  her mind and then go,  nope, that's fine.  Like you jerk off.  Like after you  take care of her,  you beat off  or something  and she'll go,  you don't want me  to do anything.  Nah, don't worry about it.  And she'll get competitive  and then she'll start  sucking your dick. 
[03:07:30]  Thank you, Patrice.  All right, let's go  to the phones.  Melanie and Philly.  Melanie.  Hey, I know that  you're taking  audience questions  so I have a question  for Patrice.  I don't mind  that a guy goes down  and eats my asshole  but there's a difference  between him going down  and eating my pussy  and then kissing me  and then eating my asshole  and kissing me.  I can't handle that.  Yeah, because you're saying  that you're not handling it  because that's what  you're supposed to say.  When you go down,  when you go down there,  it's all holds barred. 
[03:08:00]  When you're feeling good  and you're moaning,  you're running,  that's great.  Is there anything wrong  with your asshole, ma'am?  There's nothing wrong  with my asshole.  Because there's nothing  dirty about the hole itself.  It's the inside.  I'm not licking  your lower intestines, bitch.  I'm licking  your clean asshole.  You just lick my asshole  and you want me  to kiss you.  Yes.  How do you do that?  Yes.  Do you clean your booty hole?  Yes.  Then what the fuck  is the problem?  It's the same thing  as the twat.  The pussy is infinitely nastier 
[03:08:30]  than the fucking asshole.  Then the actual knot,  the balloon knot,  it should be clean  as a whistle.  This is where the difference  between man versus woman  comes in.  Exactly.  That's the problem.  That's why you shouldn't,  women should just not be allowed  to ever discuss two things  in terms of being a professional.  Fucking and funny.  Funny?  Being funny?  What?  And having sex.  You're not allowed  to have your own idea  about sex  because you don't know.  Because let me ask you a question.  Isn't there something?  Well, you're doing it to us, though.  We should be able  to have some kind of say 
[03:09:00]  and ask me.  You know what I don't like?  No, you shouldn't.  The fact that she sounds  like Jimmy's mom.  She asks the same type  of questions.  Can I ask you  a quick question,  real quick, ma'am?  How many times  have you said to yourself,  like, think about  when you was younger  and you just started fucking,  where you go,  I'll never do that.  And now you do that.  She's gone.  Hello?  She's gone.  Sorry about that.  Women just shouldn't. 
[03:09:30]  I don't know where she went.  We got Troy from Pennsylvania.  Troy?  Hey, Patrice.  Shut up.  Love him.  Hey, Patrice, you there?  Yeah, sir.  Yeah, hey, Patrice.  I've been married for 17 years  and I married my wife.  She was 19, really hot.  And now after 17 years,  she's got about 40 extra pounds.  How can I get her  to just kind of ease out  of all that weight, man,  without just saying,  look, you repulsed me.  I do not want to touch you.  How can I do that, man?  You step your game  up to such a high level, right? 
[03:10:00]  Like, my girl,  she look good.  Sometimes I get lazy  and you stop dressing nice.  What you do  is you start putting on your  I'm going to get another bitch  attitude on.  Without telling her.  You don't say,  hey, get your shit together.  You wear a top hat  and a tuxedo now  when you go to the store  and that bitch will go,  oh, my God.  And you'll see that bitch  on a treadmill tomorrow.  Trust me.  Or a simpler solution, sir,  if that doesn't work,  is on the screensaver. 
[03:10:30]  You get a scrolling screensaver  that just says,  fat cunt.  I'll try that.  I need to do something, man,  because I tell you what,  she's lucky as a soldier.  She wants to go every night  and it just makes me sick, man.  Wow.  You're in a fucked up place.  First of all,  he's already used to her  and now she's becoming  a little unattractive.  You just got to put on your  first of all,  I tell my girl all the time, 
[03:11:00]  she sees me talking to girls,  I say, look,  you know how I'm attracted to you?  You're an object.  You're physically.  You know why you're attracted to me?  Because I know how to fucking talk  and make things sound sexy.  How the fuck am I going to do that  when you don't want to hear  that bullshit from me no more?  I got to go do it  to other bitches.  If other bitches  don't want to fuck me,  how you going to want to fuck me?  So you got to go out  and be super fuckable  and she will step up her shit.  Trust me,  because you sound like  a depressed dude  who's getting,  who's sinking down further 
[03:11:30]  into her world,  which is like,  ugh.  And you know what, Patrice?  I'm not a bad looking guy.  I work out.  I'm really fit  and I could go out  and do better physically.  I mean, we got kids together  and I do love her.  But everywhere I go,  I have no problem meeting women  and I just look at her  and I look at this nice young woman  with this foot with me  and I just,  damn,  I could just move around.  That's right,  but don't threaten her with it.  Just let it happen.  Just,  it's happening.  And you know what, dude?  Don't be such a pussy. 
[03:12:00]  Go get some side.  Don't tell nobody.  Don't fucking get some side, dude.  Get some side pussy.  Like,  don't be such a fucking,  don't be so,  this is going to destroy.  Go get some dirty girl  and do that.  And your wife will go,  why doesn't he give a shit about me?  Just don't tell her.  Give her kisses.  I love you so much, sweetie.  Because she innately fucking knows.  That's what women do.  They try to make their men unsexy.  That's the plan.  They're the enemy.  They come in  and find a man  that's the shit. 
[03:12:30]  And then they try to bring them down  and make them feel good about themselves.  That's why I say,  if your bitch don't hate you,  you're not in a good relationship.  My bitch hates how much she loves me.  She has to.  She wants to be equal with me.  No, you're not.  I'm better than you.  And her whole journey  is to destroy my life.  All you got to do  is stop it from happening.  Your wife is succeeding  in destroying your life  by becoming fat.  It's a plan.  Patrice is the last king of Scotland. 
[03:13:00]  Holy shit!  That's really good.  Patrice, you got to write that book.  I'm telling you, buddy.  All right, speaking of getting side...  I just got to interrupt real quick.  I got to leave.  I got to be...  What?  I got eye surgery.  Are you talking about...  I hate to leave.  I'm really enjoying this.  His eyeballs.  Put eyes, baby.  Take care of my eyeballs, sweetie.  I'll be all right.  Where are you going?  I have a 10.30 appointment.  Why?  Because my eye's not good.  He's going to get his eyes done. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  And let me look at Jimmy  with the glasses.  Can I crush your glasses right now?  No, because I'm going to wear them  without the corrective lenses  just to make me look gentlemanly.  Thanks.  I'm a bad with glasses.  Jim Norton.  Distinguish.  I'm a good gentleman.  People on the bleachers.  The great Jim Norton.  You a little nervous, Jimmy?  Happy New Year.  Merry Christmas, young man.  You too, sweetie.  Who's going to the New Year's Eve show  with Jim Norton?  We got some people out there going?  Wow.  Good.  Overwhelming response.  Oh, boy.  Well, one person raises that.  I'm going.  One, two, three. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  They're raising their hands now.  I'm going.  North Fork Theater, Westbury,  New Year's Eve with Jim Norton.  Yes.  Some tickets still available.  I think we have a couple left to give away.  All right.  Call up if you want.  No, no, no.  You're going to kill us.  Hold on.  We've got so many great questions on the line.  Can we just give them to a few people out there?  You can do that.  Would that be all right?  That's fine.  As long as you give it away.  It came out last day before the holiday.  Here's the thing.  You should get a chance to win something.  I will see you all there on whatever it was.  Fucking New Year's Eve. 
[03:14:30]  Whatever night it is.  I'm going to be blinded.  No.  I'm fucking.  All right.  Listen, I'll see you guys later.  Do they give you drugs?  I have a half a volume I think I take after surgery.  Are you worried about feeling drugs?  Not at all.  No?  No.  Not in this case.  No.  It's fine.  Are you kind of psyched that you're going to be feeling drugs?  Not at all.  I always wonder that with addicts.  No, no.  If you would be like, holy shit, this feels.  Why do you think I'm racing out of here a half hour early?  This feels really good.  I'll see you guys.  All right, Jimmy.  Good luck. 
[03:15:00]  I'll give you a call.  All right, my love.  And it's on.  FH Riley's after your show.  Yeah, we're going to go over there after an eat and shit.  Bro's getting some kind of beer special together, and we'll have a good time.  Okay, good, man.  All right, Patrice.  All right, sweet.  Great year of radio.  Godspeed.  Great year of radio.  Godspeed.  Great Jimmy Norton.  Godspeed, my young man.  Godspeed.  How about this?  We'll take a break.  We'll continue with Patrice.  We'll get more questions from the audience.  We've got great questions on hold.  If you're on hold, stay there.  We'll get you on the air as soon as possible.  Drew Boogie in the house. 
[03:15:30]  Are you set to roll?  Yeah, he is.  Oh, yeah.  Hit it, Drew.  Oh, yeah.  I. 
[03:16:00]  I.  I.  I.  There is a new element of vulgarity.  Opie and Anthony is outrageous.  Fuck you.  Moral animal.  Fuck you.  Damages our children.  Go fuck yourself.  And diminishes their future. 
[03:16:30]  Evil.  Evil.  This is a tragedy.  This is a tragedy.  Oh boy, I'm a Nazi.  Oh boy, I'm a Nazi.  Oh boy, I'm a Nazi. 
[03:17:00]  Oh yes.  Jesus, Drew.  Wow.  We're trying to get out of here in one piece.  I told you it'd be a little dangerous.  That was a bit dangerous.  Hey, that's a nice song that he was playing there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a mix.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio, the last live show of the year.  I just like the era.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  And E-Rock's in here.  Something's going on.  What's up, E-Rock?  What do you got?  E-Rock?  He's setting up something.  I swear we have no idea.  We have a little Christmas gift for you on line 10.  For who?  For both of you.  For the show.  Oh boy.  It's going to be great.  Hello.  Hello.  Oh my goodness.  It hit me right when I...  Who the hell is this?  Excuse me, Mr. McMahon?  What? 
[03:18:00]  You're on the air.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Big fans, of course.  Oh, hi, guys.  Yeah.  You might remember us.  You hired us once.  Everybody makes a mistake every now and then.  But one thing, I never got much closure when the whole XFL pregame show thing, when we  were let go, let's say, from that, because I never heard from the boss that we were fired. 
[03:18:30]  And I would just love it if you could give me some closure and get rid of us the way  you normally do.  Yeah, we've been waiting years for this, sir.  I would be delighted.  Are you ready?  Yes, please.  You're fired!  Thank you, Mr. McMahon.  You know what I mean?  That's not as good as I do later on, but that's way early in the morning.  I'm having a phlegm early in the morning.  Yes.  You sure build some up later, though.  That's right!  Yeah, we're going to challenge you there, Vince. 
[03:19:00]  Vince, you're amazing.  I don't think you guys are making fun of me like that, by the way.  It's an homage, Vince.  I don't appreciate that.  I don't sound like that.  You don't think you sound like that?  When you hit the ring, you better believe you sound like that!  Now, we've been hearing that you might be getting tapes of Anthony doing you, sir.  Is this true or false?  Yes, it's very true.  Oh, wow.  That's very flattering.  Keeping tabs. 
[03:19:30]  Keeping tabs on you boys.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, and actually, you know, I mean, it sounds pretty close, I think.  Yeah, so close that we've also noticed that now you're doing Ant's impression of you.  That's exactly what I'm doing.  That's what I like.  You could go to hell!  Exactly.  I'm going to emulate him.  He's better than I am.  Well, Vince McMahon, what a treat.  We haven't spoken to you in so long.  What's going on in the wonderful world of the WWE? 
[03:20:00]  Well, the biggest thing that's going on, of course, is a tribute to the troops.  We just got back from Iraq.  We got a big Christmas Eve airing on USA Network.  That's great.  And it's a really, really good show.  It's an opportunity for us to go over there and bring a little slice of Americana over to our men and women over there  who are paying such a sacrifice for us and a price.  But it's really a fun, fun show.  And, again, you get to see the spirit of these men and women.  And, you know, I mean, it's enlightening when you're watching. 
[03:20:30]  It's really a fun show, and it's an opportunity as well for the kids over there to be able to say hello to everybody back over here.  Wow, what a great thing, man.  Very cool.  And, of course, who did you bring over there with you?  Well, actually, we took a lot of guys.  We took DX, of course, Shawn Michaels, and Triple H.  And Mr. Kennedy, Chris Jericho was over there.  Ray Mysterio has made quite a number of tours.  And Bob Orton, or actually would be Bob Orton's son. 
[03:21:00]  Some of the divas and what have you.  That's always good.  Ron Simmons and, you know, Jeff Hardy, a whole bunch of guys.  And we all got in the Black Hawk helicopters and went to the forward operating bases,  which is something that most people don't do.  Listen here, you insurgents.  Why don't you come here and take on some of my guns from the WWE?  We'll kick your ass.  In a cage match.  Who the hell talks like that? 
[03:21:30]  That's a great thing, man.  Those are my sentiments, exactly.  Hey, Vince, we watched the 15-year special you guys just did for Raw.  And you've got to bring back people kissing your ass, man.  That shit was the funniest stuff, man.  Kiss my ass, Bob.  You know, you're right.  I'll have to bring that back.  It was hilarious.  You know, it's not like anybody's ass.  It's my ass.  It's your ass.  That whole story, that went with the stink face then. 
[03:22:00]  You started getting into that.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that special was really good.  Not as many people knew that my ass did tricks.  So what else is going on?  I mean, who's the champ right now?  I am.  Get out of here.  No, not really.  I was going to say.  You'll always be the champ.  Yeah, I'm always the champ.  You know, we have the biggest fan ever over here.  Our own young Sam.  Really?  Yeah, Sam was so concerned when you apparently blew up in that limousine. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, you know, it made news everywhere.  It certainly did.  Yeah, it was a legitimate story seen only on WV.com.  Yeah, we were looking at the videotape, and poor Sam was very upset at your demise.  And we kept trying to tell him, look, I think this might not really be him being killed.  But he was inconsolable.  Well, it's nice to know I have that effect on one individual here in the United States. 
[03:23:00]  The one caring soul for Mr. McMahon.  And I like how the FBI was involved at first.  But then I guess the FBI got in touch.  And then somehow some other agency, the FIC, then had to get involved.  Of course, they all have to get involved.  Well, what we're getting at, sir, is that the FBI might have called Vince personally and said,  look, let's keep us out of your silly wrestling story.  And then the FIC guy, he looked mysteriously like he could have wrestled. 
[03:23:30]  Right.  You put a suit on him, you still see muscles in their neck.  Yeah.  I love you guys, man.  That's my favorite part of wrestling is when someone gets hurt in the ring and they bring in the paramedics,  but they're a little too big for their paramedics.  And you know that stuff is about to go down.  It's tough to get paramedics these days.  God damn, very good.  How's the family?  Good?  The family's great, thank you.  We miss all you guys. 
[03:24:00]  You guys used to be on our show all the time.  Shane and Stephanie.  Well, we've got to get back to doing that.  We would like that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Thank you very much for all the support for all the many years.  And you really know who your friends are when they stick with you like this.  Always.  Thank you guys so much.  And again, the tribute to the troops and the support for that especially.  That's our most important show we do.  It's even more important than WrestleMania, at least for us it is.  Yep.  And again, thanks for all that promotion as well.  Oh, no worries.  Speaking of our friendship, when is our Christmas gift getting here? 
[03:24:30]  We're running out of days.  Yeah, we're running out of days.  Yeah, we are running out of days.  I'm looking around.  I don't really see Vince present under the tree.  It must be there somewhere.  Sam got a belt.  Not really.  And seeing the smile on his face was a present enough for me, Vince.  Yeah, I will see.  There you go.  It was wonderful.  Vince, thanks so much for checking in on this last day before vacation.  And it's a great thing you do with the troops.  It really is.  And let's not forget Royal Rumble in January at Madison Square Garden here in New York. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  That would be a good one.  Right here in New York City.  Yeah, we're coming to New York.  We're coming for you.  And we're going to kick your ass.  Thank you guys very much.  Thank you, Vince.  This is a man for the WWE.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, folks.  Hey, that was a nice surprise.  How'd you guys get done?  Yeah, look at that.  I pulled some strings.  You didn't.  Pulled.  Now everyone's trying to take credit.  Was that Sam?  That was mostly E-Rock.  E-Rock?  That was about 99% E-Rock.  No wonder he's been all farting and stinking today. 
[03:25:30]  He's got a nervous belly over this whole thing.  He was all nervous.  Oh, he's all nervous and just farting and stinking.  Although they tipped off their surprise a little bit when both E-Rock and Sam walked in here.  Yeah.  So there's a guest on the phone.  There's a guest on the phone.  Why?  Guess who it is.  You didn't know.  It's got to be wrestling.  I knew before he said a word that it was going to be Vince because I looked at your face  and the smile on there, it was either that or the maker of PS3 or something. 
[03:26:00]  I like wrestling more than PS3.  I don't know.  All right.  Wow.  Thank you very much, E-Rock, for putting that together.  Now, we got Patrice O'Neal.  I don't want to lose.  There's a couple good calls.  Ray in Pennsylvania.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Show's moving fast.  What do you got for Patrice O'Neal?  You've been waiting a while here.  Hey, Patrice, I have a question for you, man.  I've been dating this girl for a month, man.  I haven't fucked her yet.  I've, you know, played with the girls, you know what I'm saying?  And the bitch won't leave me alone. 
[03:26:30]  Say it again?  Now, what do you think?  Is she crazy or is she just, I don't know.  She's in love with me.  I don't know.  See, what he's saying is he's so fucking fantastic that the bitch won't leave him alone.  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that.  All I know is, you know, people have been telling me that she's kind of crazy and she's hot.  He's got, he's fucked a girl and now she's a clingy bitch.  The problem's not him.  He just told you.  I mean, the problem's not her.  He just told you what the problem is.  First of all, dude, he's calling in to even higher his self-esteem that is low. 
[03:27:00]  And I'm not even trying to be funny.  He goes, guys have warned him that this bitch is crazy.  He still fucked with her.  He was surprised that he fucked with her because he had to add she was hot just in case.  He's not a hot guy.  So basically, here's what you should fucking do.  You should leave this girl alone and go get a girl that your self-esteem will allow you to deal with.  Because you won't even be able to deal with a crazy bitch that's pretty, that's stalking you. 
[03:27:30]  He's happy about that.  That's what he's saying.  I'm getting stalked.  Yeah.  He was just calling a brag.  That's not a problem.  Someone's stalking me.  Dude, enjoy until you get that fucking rape case.  All right, sir.  Anyone have a question out there for Patrice?  No one else brave enough?  We got one.  Raise your hand.  What is that?  Hold on.  Uh, Stan will get you.  Oh.  Is it?  Oh, great. 
[03:28:00]  It's young Flea man.  Young Flea has a...  You know what?  Flea, after every show, like if he comes to a show of mine, Flea will talk to me for an hour and a half about his problems with women.  No shit.  His last problem was he was in love with this old broad and she left him.  Um, and he just, he just was kept pouring his soul out, whatever's...  How old was she?  He found another one at bar nine.  He, he, he, he fucking stalks old women.  Does he really?  That's your thing?  Yeah.  That's the thing.  Flea chases old women. 
[03:28:30]  No, actually...  He was making out with some old broad at bar nine.  How old was she?  She was actually 38, but, uh, the story that Patrice is talking about is...  That's old for you.  I know.  You're what, 20?  Yeah.  So, but, uh...  You got a mommy thing or something?  No, I'm...  Flea's rhythm is just uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's the kind of guy that gives that old thing where you give a phone number out.  Two, one...  Two, eight, six.  Yeah, he's got a weird way of talking. 
[03:29:00]  I have a question about, uh, a sex.  Do you?  Why?  That's...  Yeah.  My question for Patrice is, uh, how do you get a girl to put out?  Get out of here.  How to put out?  That's rookie shit.  Yeah, that's like...  To put out?  What the fuck is that?  That's like junior high shit.  It sounds like Napoleon Dolomite.  Uh, Patrice, I want to know, how do I get to first base? 
[03:29:30]  Right, right.  Where do I put my penis?  Which one?  I heard there was a story that, uh, perhaps you were, um, uh, your hand was going over  a girl's shirt?  Well, it was, uh, two nights ago.  I brought a girl, she's 18 years old, and I met her thanks to my roommate, and I took  her out to dinner once, and we ended up going to Parker, like, a couple times to walk around.  I brought her back to my room.  We ended up, you know, making out on my bed, and I go for a feel outside the shirt, and  as I tried to go underneath, she said, no, no, no, I don't want to go any further. 
[03:30:00]  So, I felt like a shithead, and then it kind of ended awkwardly, because she had to leave  and study for tests, and I got blue balls, and then I had to jerk off and go to sleep.  Yuck.  So, all right.  So, you're wondering, uh, what you could have done between above the shirt and under the  shirt that would have kept her, uh, there?  I'm wondering, is there anything in between?  I'm wondering, is there anything in between or something that I should, uh, change or do 
[03:30:30]  that would maybe...  Yeah, seriously, Flea, like, it's a power thing, and you're just so uncomfortable, and  I'm not just trying to be funny, you're so uncomfortable that you, you give girls power,  like, you give anybody who talks to you right away, you gave them power.  Like, there's nothing about you that says, I own my own space.  So, if some, there's no way you shouldn't be able to fuck an 18-year-old.  You should be able to talk your way into some 18-year-old pussy.  But you're so giving her her little power, that that's why, always, a woman gets off 
[03:31:00]  more telling a guy no, that she can control, than fucking actually giving up pussy.  Women like, especially an 18-year-old girl, they like men wanting to fuck them.  This is why, this is the great thing about God, is that, I'm serious, that God has made  it so when guys get my age, ah, I look at women my age, 38, 39, 40, blech.  And they want to fuck all the time. 
[03:31:30]  And you go, get the fuck out of here.  And they don't want to play, they just want dick.  But women 18, they like to want to be fucked.  They just like guys to want to fuck them.  And Flea is one of those, Flea, you're never going to learn until you get 40.  That's, you're stuck.  Because you're the type of, and I'm not even trying to be an asshole, you're the type of  dude that makes 18-year-old girls struggle all through their life till they're 38 and  they meet me and they find out, oh my God, I've been wasting all my fucking time. 
[03:32:00]  Because like I keep saying, the value of pussy is like cars and ain't like houses.  It goes down.  All right.  Go get some roofies or something, Flea.  Yeah, Flea, you're a deep shit.  Right.  You're a deep shit, Flea.  Yeah, let's say hi to Bob in Michigan.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, how about it so you know?  Hey.  I got a question for Dr. Patrice.  Yeah.  Yeah, hey, my wife, five years, wants to do a threesome.  Yeah.  But she's not really too willing to do in the leg work. 
[03:32:30]  She wants me to do it.  And I've had threesomes in the past.  Dangerous.  Don't do it.  The other group.  Don't do it.  Don't do, never.  And if you do, it's very rare what you do immediately and just don't be greedy.  Get this.  Because I do that sometimes where I fucking start the leg because my girl doesn't know  women hate other women and they don't know how to fucking keep talking their way in  the shit.  As soon as you get information about this other chick, you give the number to your wife 
[03:33:00]  and then you walk your wife through to this other bitch.  The other bitch should never have contact with you.  This other threesome girl that dumped us, I'm sitting there like, fuck, because I'm thinking  about what I would say.  Like, well, hold on, bitch.  Wait a minute.  What's going on here?  I'll talk my way.  My girl's not going to talk her way into pussy.  They don't like girls enough like that.  And you would seem a little overeager going to your girl and going, hey, why don't you  call her again?  Hey, call a threesome girl.  You can't be greedy on this one, dude.  Do not go out and get the girls. 
[03:33:30]  Your relationship will be over.  Right.  Well, at first she said that's what she wanted me to do, but she has to approve.  And I'm like, no, no, no.  You need to scout.  You need to go find what you like.  All right.  Because you know I'm going to be happy with anything.  I mean, we go to topless bars, man.  And my wife gets so turned on.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  That's a tough thing, man.  Girls are just, they really just should leave us to certain things. 
[03:34:00]  I'll give them certain things.  They can have health.  Like caring about living and dying and shit.  But, but when it comes to funny and when it comes to fucking, man, just let dudes handle  it, man.  Let dudes handle it.  But they don't understand that shit because I tell my girl, her, she gets really jealous,  but she's, it's like I tell her, I own your jealousy.  The only reason your jealousy means something to me is because I go, I go, I give you a  jealousy power, but I can go, look, I want to fuck this other bitch. 
[03:34:30]  What are you going to do?  You're either going to leave me or you're going to fucking stay.  But I give her the jealousy.  I go, look, oh, come on, baby.  You're the greatest.  But everything you give a bitch is you give it to them.  That's what it is.  Motherfuckers, girls get confused that they actually are running shit.  They're not.  You know, what is it?  Five women to every one guy I do?  Five to fucking one?  One, and God put my horniness on earth for me to be with one bitch, and there's four  other bitches that got no man. 
[03:35:00]  Then you got homosexuals, then you got dead motherfuckers, then you got retarded motherfuckers.  I got all their shit.  There's 15, 20 women I should be fucking, and I'm not because I love you?  Goofy bitch, grow up.  We got Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  He's got a really good question for you, Patrice.  He writes, I have a sincere question for Patrice.  He's the only one that can answer this one.  How do I get my girl to let me cum in her mouth, then spit it in another girl's ass and  tell me to fuck it? 
[03:35:30]  That takes years and years.  That's like the last boss of a real hard game.  You got to go find all the cheat codes for that one.  X, X, up, down, square, question mark.  You got to find God mode.  That's tough, man.  You can only do that if you're a general fan.  Once you get that, once you fill their out, you get them filthy to that level.  But a lot of guys, you know what, like talking to dudes, a lot of dudes are fucking just as 
[03:36:00]  square as girls.  All right, hold on.  They're directing us today.  Stalker Patty's by the microphone.  Stalker Patty.  Oh, Patty.  I have a question for Dr. Patrice.  Patrice.  What is somebody my age supposed to do?  Every place or whatever I visit to meet guys, they're all half my age.  And then everybody I know in person is either married, gay, or dead.  What am I supposed to do to meet somebody?  Patty, join the third part of Patty. 
[03:36:30]  Here's a problem with Patty.  When she says, when women like fucking Patty say, meet you, she means meet a guy that wants  to be with her.  Yeah.  Patty, you got to give up that messy twat.  You got to fuck a guy first.  You're building your house.  You got to build your house from the top to the bottom.  Right.  You fuck the foundation.  Start on the roof.  What about AIDS and diseases?  I'm scared to death.  How much time do you got left to live as a healthy person anyway? 
[03:37:00]  Probably not more than 30 years.  Listen, with all the medicine now, you'll live.  If you get AIDS now, you'll live until the time you were supposed to die without AIDS.  Really?  Pretty much.  All right.  So I hear so many warnings nowadays.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  The guy that would, the guy that you would fuck wouldn't have anything.  Believe me.  Don't worry about it.  He'd be just like you.  Some fucking shut in that hasn't been fucked.  Basically, Patrice is saying there's nothing interesting about you where a guy would want 
[03:37:30]  to just hang out with you.  You got to give up the pussy.  Your voice would clear out your bad blood cells.  As soon as you start talking, all the AIDS are just, I'm out of here.  Oh.  I can't.  The AIDS virus can't take it.  I'm bored with this body.  She's the cure.  She's the cure for AIDS.  Yeah.  Just talk.  And I shouldn't have a problem because I don't think I'm bad looking for somebody my age.  Yeah, she goes, for some of my age.  That's great.  All right, all right.  Patty, how much money did you collect yesterday? 
[03:38:00]  Uh, 271 and I paid all my bills, so I'm happy.  Of course, she was part of the Money Honey contest.  The videos are up on YouTube.  They're terrific.  She was rolling around naked?  Yeah, it was disgusting.  She's disturbing.  And I don't mean disturbing.  She's right there, by the way.  It's like she's so disturbing.  Yeah.  She just looks like such a holocaust.  Yeah, it's definitely a holocaust thing.  You just want to throw some lye right on her.  But Jimmy likes her ass.  And we keep trying to figure out if Jimmy's joking, but I don't think he is. 
[03:38:30]  I think he, I think it's something weirdly, I don't, it, ugh.  But it's like, you don't, you would fuck Patty, I guess, if he was.  Patty brought us gifts today?  It's just a couple things.  It's no big deal.  I want to make a big deal out of it.  Well, because of past years, I'm sure.  But, uh.  What did she bring us for Christmas?  Ah, hold on.  Yeah, there's guys that would fuck her.  There's plenty of guys.  Oh, absolutely.  There's a bunch of our listeners.  And especially if she's a, she's a virgin, that should have just.  Has she fucked yet? 
[03:39:00]  No.  No.  That's her claim to fame.  We did teach her how to masturbate this year on the show.  But she gets all fucked up when she's ready to come.  She, like, freaks out.  I think.  I think.  Look at that.  Jesus Christ.  Patty.  Hi, Patty.  What do you got?  Okay, well, first of all, here's the card.  Give Opie the card.  So he can read it.  Is there a gift certificate in this?  Anthony, this is pretty good.  Patty, is this a.  I get the little tiny bag.  Patty, is this a.  And Opie gets the big bag.  Is there a gift certificate?  As per the stalking of Opie thing. 
[03:39:30]  No, it's a thank you card.  And she gave you Christmas gifts in a bag that is evidently from her house?  No, it's from where I work.  Yeah, it was from where you work, but it's from your house.  It's no big deal.  Oh my God.  She actually writes out her own cards.  I do.  I don't like pre-made cards.  I'd rather do my own.  Different flavored, shut up.  Different flavored cocoa mix.  So I could sit and drink some hot cocoa.  Yeah.  Thank you, Patty.  How fast is that going in the garbage? 
[03:40:00]  Ooh.  No, no, no, no, no.  Are you holding a can over while you're driving down a fucking L.I.E.?  I'd be throwing in a fucking cabbie's.  A dirty cabbie's windshield.  I keep all Starbucks stuff.  Do you?  Why is mine wrapped?  It's not wrapped.  Oh, here's the card that she wrote to the show.  Dear O-A-N-J, I want to wish you the best holiday ever.  Thank you for allowing me to be a part of the show and for making my life more interesting.  You're the best, and I wish you good things always. 
[03:40:30]  Here's to 2008 and another fun year of great radio.  I'm proud and happy to be a friend of the show always.  You are number one.  Sincerely yours, Patty.  What is this?  What is that?  She's so emotional.  I heard that.  That's funny.  Thank you, Patty.  You're welcome.  That's it.  That's coffee.  By the way, did you get your gift from this other guy?  Whoa.  What is that, a diaper? 
[03:41:00]  It's wrapped in a diaper.  Yours is somewhere around here, too.  Oh, great.  He thinks it's home.  What is it?  You might have thrown it away.  It's the same guy that gave you the car and the Nazi stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I got a replica Shelby, just like mine.  Yeah.  And I got a bunch of Nazi stuff.  Yeah.  Little flags and little arm patches from the era.  Right.  Not reproductions.  And a magazine that was from 1960, and it had all kinds of Nazi rape stories in it. 
[03:41:30]  But not like fiction.  It's like the Nazi rape tents of Egypt.  It's like this weird, that's fucking old erotica.  There's some guy that looked like Harrison Ford who's trying to stop the rapes.  Well, I guess Bill sent that, and it was very thoughtful.  He knows a lot about you, and that's a fun gift, right?  Yeah.  Well, Bill sent me something, too. 
[03:42:00]  It's wrapped in diapers.  It's wrapped in diapers, yeah.  That's just nasty, even without shit in it.  Oh, I know.  It says, Opie, you are a hard person to get a gift for.  These plates have been in my family for a long time.  Aw.  I wanted you to have them.  Please handle them with care.  What a smartass.  I'm just kidding.  Uh-huh.  Make sure they, uh...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Here's where Opie hurts himself before vacation. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, watch your eyes.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, boy.  He's making it...  It's clay now. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, there's glass dust everywhere.  Oh, shit.  And diaper dust.  Glass and diaper.  Thank you.  I know.  Very predictable.  I think you just pounded a hole through the console.  Yeah, right?  Is that console dust?  Now I need that mask again from yesterday with Tippi Tom.  Anyone itching today, by the way?  What?  Did they clean all the bugs out of the studio? 
[03:43:30]  Bed bugs?  I don't know, man.  Lice?  I have no idea.  Wow, that is really dusty.  Those plays were made with asbestos.  Yeah, right?  He's just killed us.  Uh, Butters is checking in to say hi.  Butters, this is Doug Stanhope's friend from Arizona.  What's up, Butters?  Hey, boys, how's it going?  Hello.  Are you still listening to the show?  Oh, always.  Every day, guys.  Thank you, sir.  What do you got?  All right.  All right.  Two things.  One, I wanted to ask Patrice a question. 
[03:44:00]  Two, I've got a gift for you guys.  But can we, like, can I ask Patrice a question first?  Sure.  He's gay, by the way.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm not.  Well, Doug thinks you are.  Uh, well, I don't know.  But anyway, um, Patrice, uh, when I'm trying to, like, uh, get on a chick, I pretty much  think I defeat myself in the beginning, because I've had, like, really bad luck with women 
[03:44:30]  and stuff.  So, uh, I was wondering, is there, like, any tips you have on not to feel defeated before  you ask them out?  I don't know.  I want to dump you right now, and I don't, I just want to, I want to break up with you.  I don't think you can come out of it.  I mean, as we know, like, it's like, Opie, it's like, this is, this is like, it's hard  to tell a guy how to have confidence.  I'm not a help with fucking, the higher level bullshit, like happiness. 
[03:45:00]  Like, this is just.  Shit, you were talking about devious fucking fucking.  Yeah, I'm not the pickup, I'm not a pickup artist, cause, you know, shit, everybody got  their own style.  I wish I was one of these dudes that had a six pack and just walk down the street and  show a bitch my stomach and get a bitch, but.  Oh, I thought you meant beer when you said that.  Oh, no, no, no, like, drink this bitch.  Well, sometimes that works, too.  And put a, put this pill in it.  It's delicious.  It wasn't even a thought that you would actually have good abs.  I'm sorry.  Exactly.  I'm so far away from a nice body. 
[03:45:30]  When you said six pack, it's like, it has to be beer.  Hey, you know, when I'm trying to get my hips in condition, really.  You can't teach someone confidence.  Yeah, it's hard to do, dude.  We all lack it on some level.  Because it just comes from the fact of, it's like that, I keep going back to this two girls  in one cup, it's like, this is why we hate women.  And it's all the shit we got to do to find out that they just shit in a cup.  We have to have a good, a nice house.  Like, your status and your status is so far above pussy. 
[03:46:00]  But in reality, it only makes you level with pussy.  If you meet a chick in the street, the fact that she has a pussy and you have an entire  existence matches up.  That's even Steven.  It's fucking disgusting.  You want, you got an education, you got a home, you got a this, you got a that.  And then you still have to have confidence.  Bitch, my credit score is 750.  I got to have confidence too?  Like a motherfucker like this, like Butter should just be able to walk up to a girl and 
[03:46:30]  go, look, I got pills.  Yeah.  You want to share my Vicodin, bitch?  Like, but it's all that, it's all the shit we got to do just to fuck them.  And they think that should be now, that should be credibility for them to be with me for  the rest of my fucking life.  And like my girl, like I tell my girl, she goes, look, she goes, I love you.  And they're like, I love you too.  Cause we worked out this deal where she's married to me right now.  Like she wants to have my last name and all that, but I'm just not, I'm not ready to  marry her, but she could be in love with me enough to be my wife. 
[03:47:00]  You gave her a ring, didn't you?  Yeah.  And I told him, make that shit, whatever you want to make it.  Make that shit, whatever you want to make it.  That's because you're scared inside.  To get married?  Look it, I know this bitch.  You can't head over to a Gage Marine and go, whatever you want it to mean, that's fine  with me.  It's the rank and file you want to give it.  Now, let me ask you a question.  You're the general in your army.  Now, your privates are going to behave differently than, like if you're a five-star general, you  still, you have more credit than a three-star general. 
[03:47:30]  If a three-star general comes up to you, he's going to go, yes, sir, but he's going to  go with the two fingers and go, yeah, yes, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  Give you that little flippy.  So, your girl, as you keep...  But what's wrong with, like, letting your guard down a little bit?  You can't.  They're out to destroy you.  You gotta, though.  They're out to destroy you.  I'm not saying a little bit, though.  It would have been nice to say, look.  Trust me, I let my guard down a little bit.  Let's not bullshit.  You know when all our arguments happen is when I let my guard down?  All right, so make it, let it down a little bit.  What is letting it down? 
[03:48:00]  I feed the bitch, I kiss her, I tell her I love her.  How do you let your guard down?  What is letting guard down?  Go coochie, coochie, gumdrops?  Then the guard down would be, look, this ring is because I love you, and you're kind  of my wife now.  Well, because...  Instead of, let it mean whatever you want it to mean.  That's crazy.  But you know why?  Because you give it to him, and she'll go, this is what it means.  It's like, you go, look, can I just...  Here's the thing, Opie.  This is a fucking big problem.  Men should understand, or women should understand that we, it's better if a guy likes you than 
[03:48:30]  loves you.  Love is the end for men.  It's over.  We have no more creativity.  We don't like you anymore.  We don't go, when, ask, this is the whole thing about men being different than women.  Ask a man by himself with two men sitting around, ask that motherfucker, are you in love?  A guy would never go, yes!  A guy would go, yeah, yeah, but what's your point?  Why would the fuck you bring my life down by asking me, am I in love? 
[03:49:00]  Ask a girl, you in love?  Oh my God!  Ask a girl, a guy, he just met a bitch that when he fucks her, she leaves, she don't talk  that much.  Yo, I met this bitch, I like this man.  I like the shit out of her.  You're happy when you like a bitch.  You're miserable when you love a bitch.  So I'm trying to like my bitch and love her at the same time.  You gotta write that book.  Wow.  And I guess that's it.  Yeah.  You gotta write that book, I'm telling you.  I'll do it, I'm in.  People would read your book.  I'm in. 
[03:49:30]  I just wanna stay happy, it trickles down from me.  Right on.  It's shit.  Anybody else out there have anything?  It works for him.  That's why I can't be no woman president.  One more question.  Fuck your shit up.  Yeah, she'll bleed every month for no reason.  How the fuck she gonna run the country?  One more question, because then we do line of the day and start our vacation.  Oh, it's home.  Yeah, gotta get out.  What do you got, sir?  It's more like a situation.  Me and this girl, I'm dating for like a week and we kicked a few back.  We're back in my apartment at school and we're messing around.  I got finger blasted her a little bit and then she just passes out. 
[03:50:00]  So I'm like, all right, this sucks.  So like 10 minutes later, I see her wake up.  She goes and sits in my computer chair that I have next to my desk and she just pisses  all over the place.  Nice.  How do I tell her?  Like, I'm so embarrassed to even talk to her about it.  Like, and it's really pissing me off.  Why do you, why are you, why are you fucking, why are you so, why do you need to tell her?  That doesn't bother you if somebody pissed on your chair?  Like that would.  No, that's why you're fucking rookie.  Hey man.  You use that for fucking weaponry later when the bitch opened her mouth. 
[03:50:30]  That's why you pissed in my chair, bitch, last week.  Like, why are guys so faggoty now?  So why is she pissing your fucking chair, you snitch?  Leave her alone.  Plus she doesn't give blowjobs anyway.  That's your thing.  You see, he's a revenge world guy.  I hate, I love revenge world.  You ever seen revenge world?  No, no.  It's a site where guys just put up pictures of their ex-girls or some bitch they mad at.  It makes no sense.  There's no reason to ever snitch a girl out.  That's your fault. 
[03:51:00]  Whatever's happening, if you can't get your dick sucked, it's not their fault.  Understand, they don't want to suck your dick.  Here's, ready?  In a nutshell.  Guys are trying to get pussy without having to give up time.  Women are trying to get time without having to give up pussy.  Do you understand what that means?  So if you're a fucking asshole that lets her hang around and suck up your space and pee all over your chairs  and she's not antying up no pussy, that's your fault, motherfucker.  Your fault.  That's right.  Tell that bitch to suck your dick or leave.  Take an L. 
[03:51:30]  Take an L.  Take a fucking L.  Be prepared to say fuck you, get lost.  Beat it, bitch, go.  Pissy chair bitch, get out.  Pissy chair bitch.  He's trying to get revenge for not getting a blowjob.  That's your fault.  Revenge don't do shit to her.  Yeah, dude, stop.  How do I tell her she peed in my chair?  I want to tell her and hurt her feelings.  It's ridiculous.  It's our fault, fellas.  Can we understand that?  All right, Patrice.  Thank you.  We want to start our vacation.  God damn, that's great. 
[03:52:00]  So we can get the fuck out of here before noon.  I'm ready, dude.  I'm ready.  And me too.  Line of the day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  Play BodogFantasy's NFL playoff pick'em game for free and win a trip to Vegas courtesy  of BodogFantasy.net.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  I jerked off seven times and it still didn't take care of the pain.  It didn't get the evil out.  I just had to sleep.  What the fuck is so like...  I like the Wolfman.  You know the Wolfman locks himself in?  Yeah, yeah.  No matter what you hear, don't open this door. 
[03:52:30]  That's a great line, man.  Right on.  They always tell him that shit.  And they always get out.  Dopes.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  It's a cobblestone.  What do you watch, Kojak?  Where they chop you on your neck and you pass out?  It's not Hawaii Five-0.  No one does that.  It's usually a homeless guy.  Karate chop to the shoulder.  Right.  Hi-ya. 
[03:53:00]  And you're sleeping.  That never works.  No.  Jim Norton.  Oh, did we get the Jim Norton tickets away?  We got the box here.  Hey, we got a pair of tickets, I believe, for Jim Norton, New Year's Eve, North Fork Theater,  Long Island.  Then, of course, FH Riley's Bro's Place after the Norton Show, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington.  We're all going to be there.  Definitely.  Cheesecake for everybody, beer for everybody.  So, we just pull a name out?  Yeah.  All right.  Herman. 
[03:53:30]  Herman Hernandez.  Did he leave?  All right.  Cool.  Dude, you got tickets to the Jim Norton Show.  And I think he's throwing in VIP passes and all that crap.  So, you're going to be well taken care of.  Sit your ass down.  All right.  Sit back down.  I didn't ask you to stand up or nothing.  What the fuck do you think this is?  Big-ass Herman took a fucking bow.  Like Herman.  And one more for Brendan.  Brendan Boyce.  There you go.  You got tickets to Jim Norton. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, he deserves a break.  That guy looks like he hasn't won a thing in his life.  God bless him.  Thank God.  There is a God.  You know what I mean?  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  What?  You just started with, I'm a racist?  Yeah.  I didn't say, I'm a racist.  Wait, I like my shows with a black friend.  Yeah.  They went out to the sticks line.  Just because I, I don't know, we'll see.  I couldn't relate to all black cast of a sitcom.  What an ass.  I just can't. 
[03:54:30]  But I watch Gilligan's Island.  Well.  If you asked me about Gilligan's Island, I said, huh?  You would be like, what are you, an asshole?  That's all that was on.  You had no choice.  You were kind of fucked back then.  Whitey gave you white shows you had to watch.  I could have just looked at the moon and thought of black things.  How great was Chris Rock today?  Yeah.  I have a feeling he'll come back, which is cool.  You can always tell when a guy's going to come back and when he's not.  Just to, like, say some honest stuff a little bit.  He was great, man. 
[03:55:00]  What else were you promoting?  Patrice Comics.  Yes.  Next Friday and Saturday.  I wouldn't remember.  C-O-M-I-X dot com.  212-524-2500, I think, is the number.  And we got to get you a book deal.  I'm ready, man.  Why don't you walk me through so many things?  Don't just tell me that after 15 years of this business, you can just, man, go be successful.  Nigga, why don't you give me a fucking help?  I don't know what to fucking do half the time.  You see, Chris Rock called me a loser.  I'm just taking your advice. 
[03:55:30]  I'm just taking your advice.  I need to continue having power over you.  So, figure it out, motherfucker.  Figure it out.  Here's your book deal.  It means whatever you want it to be.  Whatever you want it to be.  It's a book deal.  Go get a book deal, man.  Take whatever you want to fuck alone.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  If you're fucking with the pussy, that's your fault.  So, you just got to introduce it into your life.  You just do it.  Maybe turn all the chairs in your apartment upside down.  Just something.  Hey, thank you, guys. 
[03:56:00]  For the new year, baby.  Happy new year, gentlemen.  Happy new year.  Yes.  And all that stuff.  Let's hear it for Patrice O'Neill.  He's given us some great radio over the last year.  Absolutely.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Should I look back?  Yeah, give him a bow with your pimp hat that you're wearing.  I'm going to do that.  That's what I'm saying.

Thank you.  The rest of them.  That was actually really a genius, racist lie right there.  Yeah, that's funny.  Very racist.  Very funny.  A caller gets runner-up line of the day today.  Very good.
