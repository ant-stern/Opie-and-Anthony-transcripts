<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Anthony discussing his burgeoning relationship with traffic reporter Jill Nicolini, detailing their communications and the anticipation of a date. This was followed by an account of his visit to the Carousel strip club after seeing his newborn niece.  The firing of Philadelphia DJ Kid Chris for playing a racially offensive song sparked a lengthy discussion about the changing landscape of radio and the potential repercussions for Opie and Anthony themselves.  They also covered various news items, including Ted Kennedy's health, Barack Obama's rally attendance, and the surprising Yankee baseball superstition of using golden thongs to break hitting slumps.  The hosts delved into other baseball superstitions,  ranging from eating chicken to urinating on one's hands, and discussed the new Indiana Jones movie,  including a segment on the legend of the crystal skulls.  This portion included listener calls and a mention of a new employee, "Stunt Brain."  A studio guest, Roland, participated in the Indiana Jones discussion.

The Indiana Jones movie review continued into the next segment, followed by a call from Bonnie, a listener in rehab for cocaine and methamphetamine addiction, prompting a frank and crude discussion about her drug use.  Mike Huckabee's NRA joke about Barack Obama led to a discussion of Anthony's gun collection, his new pool, and a news story about "date night" at a gun range, further fueling the conversation about guns and dating.  The hosts returned to their developing relationship with Jill Nicolini, teasing listeners with ambiguous details about their plans.  Brief mentions of George Takei's marriage and other media personalities were also included.

A subsequent segment opened with a discussion about the production of a "TMZ-style" report involving a cuckoo clock, highlighting the producer Derrick's role. The release of the Nintendo Wii Fit was discussed, along with listener experiences and a planned bit involving Coach Mike.  Anthony's accidental text message, possibly sent while at a strip club, and Jill Nicolini's response to it were discussed at length. This segued into a broader discussion about radio standards and the hosts' controversial style, including an anecdote about Opie finding and wearing panties.  A review of John McCain's SNL appearance, along with sexually charged descriptions of Hillary Clinton's appearance, followed.  A significant portion of this segment was dedicated to a graphic description, using highly offensive language, of a disturbing animated video depicting child sexual abuse by a character called Mr. McGregor.  The segment also included discussions of "achy boners," a tense phone call with Curtis Sliwa (featuring accusations of stalking), a drumming bit with audio clips, and further sexually explicit banter.  A brief interaction with Steve, a CBS employee in the studio, about a planned bit involving jackets was also included.

A heated discussion about their professional standing and a perceived slight by Curtis Sliwa dominated another segment. Opie and Anthony expressed anger over Sliwa's alleged dishonesty regarding a potential guest appearance, highlighting misleading statements from his producer.  They contrasted their recent contract renewal with Sliwa’s perceived financial struggles.  The conversation involved threats to release leaked compromising photos of corporate executives, allegedly linked to a past incident involving paint and Chris Oliveira. Steve Carlessi, a producer or associate, participated, initially facing accusations of mob connections due to persistent calls.  The discussion included mob references, accusations of lying, and anecdotes about their interactions with Howard Stern and Opie's drunk text message.  The segment concluded with further mocking of Curtis Sliwa and a discussion of listener numbers and future prospects.

[00:10:30]  today and someone goes oh it was mike it was stunt brain he goes uh maybe he's a little confused  because he's taking a different route into the city today a little confused which uh which roads  which roads to take in no they're stunt brain uh no that's all right it was pretty funny actually  you know what you don't always get you don't always get caught up with the baby right away it  might take a little while but my nephew it takes a couple times to see because at first that's the 
[00:11:00]  baby yeah it's funny but then you start holding it there you go this is your cheek yeah and you see  it a lot i'm sorry you're you're you're you're used to it you're gonna change a little bit am i  absolutely it doesn't mean you're gonna want to be a father of five or any of that crap but you're  going to change a little bit a little bit if you don't then you're just not human then you're just  then you're a lost cause then i'm a lost cause yeah absolutely which we kind of think already  but thanks i think you're right we were actually hoping like you would come in and go all right i 
[00:11:30]  am human i kind of had almost a tear in my eye seeing my brother really happy with his kid there  that he didn't want but now he's happy that the kid is here and your brother would be an unbelievable  father a certain traffic uh reporter may have called me a baby hater in a message may have called  me a baby hater why why is she saying that now oh i'm gonna give away too much but just chatting  i think she might she may have heard some stuff on the air of course my on-air banter you do know 
[00:12:00]  her brothers and her family they all listen to this radio show so yeah so you think you're safe when  you talk uh while she's on tv but she's getting full reports oh i know baby hater  you got the second part right baby i wouldn't say  unbelievable  well a lot of people want to uh they want our opinion on the the kid chris thing in philadelphia  wow uh i think it i think there's a national story at this point uh kid chris uh worked at ysp 
[00:12:30]  he did afternoons uh they brought in a pd john cook who just who just in my humble opinion was  just a bad guy just a bad dude simple as that and uh he uh decided that kid chris was the future of  ysp and uh he pretty much uh showed us the curb uh i heard it was his decision and then he started  lying and saying that uh you know i i wasn't returning his phone calls all this stuff it was 
[00:13:00]  unbelievable how much of a just a bad dude this this guy was you know a lot of pds are bad dudes but  this guy took the cake yeah but anyway then kid chris moved to mornings and he was doing okay  and um he played uh just an unbelievably uh racist song somewhere in march in march like march 21st i  believe was the first airing that's amazing and uh not even safe if you squeak by with a couple of  days on something usually if you play something to do something you think all right 
[00:13:30]  we kind of made it yeah yeah and uh later and then friday after the show like everyone's  blackberries and emails were going nuts that kid chris got fired out of nowhere i'm like what  and then someone sent me the song and it's so easy to say this now but i swear to you i cannot imagine  why you would ever play that song on the radio and it's easy to kind of like take a little shot at  kid chris now you know but that's not what we're doing i'm i'm saying this i'm just amazed that he  would take that chance in this in this climate in this day and age of radio because we have you 
[00:14:00]  crazy we've explained many many times on our show it's not about fcc regulations anymore and with the  imus situation we work for the company that you know fired imus they're not going to tolerate any  of that over the top you know racist stuff and we're not we don't agree with that whatsoever by the  way no i think you should be able to play whatever you want as long as it's fcc compliant but  yeah but we're not that way but you got to understand the game we don't agree with it if you're  going to take a chance like that odds are you're going to be in some deep trouble you know we yell 
[00:14:30]  on screen we want to do our asian humor again and we want to get we want to make fun of anybody and  anything but in this day and age you just can't if you want to stay on the radio and that's that's  our frustration here as we do this radio show every day uh with that said when i heard this song i'm  like what and then and then i found out that they played it a few times and i don't know what  happened between march 21st and uh this past friday but you know and i haven't talked to  anyone but it's my assumption that somebody started complaining like and and they got scared and said 
[00:15:00]  look we got to just you know clear the field here we got to purge we got to fire everybody which it  sounds like they did down there in philly yeah that's uh we we usually get things from uh our agent  or lawyers we get transcripts from uh radio shows that have been fired or suspended because of  things and you read them and it's almost an insult you go like why are you sending me this right of  course we wouldn't do something like that it's just so blatant and obvious that it would get you 
[00:15:30]  in trouble right and that's exactly what this song was you i listened to it and was like who in their  right mind would play this on the air the only thing i could say to in his defense like there  was a time in radio where not everybody was on the radar like syndicated shows like us howard back in  the day major on the radar so you couldn't get away with anything because you had a lot more eyes like  kind of looking at you especially when you're broadcasting from bigger cities and bigger markets  waiting for you to trip up right but this in this day and age of radio everybody every single uh radio 
[00:16:00]  show is on the radio thanks to the internet and everything else on the radar excuse me on the  radar you know thanks to the internet and everything else so you can't just like there was a time like  when and i were working at af we we took major chances because we knew that we weren't quote on the  radar yeah but these radio guys got to understand every single one of them is absolutely being watched  absolutely being watched and they're all just waiting for you to mess up and play that racist 
[00:16:30]  song or say this one thing yep and then they blog their asses off they get the attention of some  of these uh special interest groups that could completely destroy your career it gives them  their moment you know this one racist song that kid chris played really just destroyed his career  you know i'm i'm i i mean he's talented enough and and he'll he'll he'll get another gig eventually  you know i don't know when though yeah because this is a doozy man this is a doozy i wonder if the 
[00:17:00]  pd okayed it i don't know what happened i wonder if he played it for him or if he heard it the first  time in a loud replay i don't think stuff like that actually it's not that technical like the pd  isn't in on anything he probably just played it yeah pd probably didn't even hear it or notice that  he was out or meeting or not listening right that's usually what happens it's not like okay can we play  this right well let me listen to it oh okay yeah that's good enough i'm telling you that john cook  in my opinion was a bad bad dude and he got what he deserved i don't i have i have no remorse for 
[00:17:30]  him you know i feel i feel bad for kid chris i'm not gonna lie to you you know he ended up taking our  slot down there in philly but i feel bad for him we've been in this situation it really that's never  really sucks and then part of me's thinking did he do this on purpose to get out of his gig because  it's like i say absolutely not because everyone has said that about us every time we screw up they  go i think they did it on purpose and i'm sitting there going no i swear to you we didn't i really 
[00:18:00]  kind of wanted my job yeah so i'm saying no i heard he you know he was happy with living in philly i heard  he was uh house hunting so oh god it doesn't sound like he he was uh trying to blow up his career but  wow what a turn of events that's a biggie and of course we've already uh we've already gotten phone  calls and uh we could say that much yeah you know we um and we want our our slot back badly  badly and we'll be having some love to be back in philly please we'll be having some discussions uh  today and tomorrow that's for sure see if we can work something out this would rule there's a few 
[00:18:30]  complications in there but uh you know i gotta i gotta see who's still there that we completely  destroyed on the air but um here's the story how it went down without the song because we're not  even allowed to play we're not allowed to um uh read the transcript nothing that's how brutal  this thing was yeah can we hum it and and and on friday it was online everywhere yeah and uh and now  it's it's really hard to find oh really really i still have a copy on my blackberry on my computer 
[00:19:00]  i guess steve could throw it up on one of our websites no why not no you don't think so are you  crazy why not no don't throw it up anywhere steve christ on a pony how about for the animation  content yes  animate this song please yeah no this thing is uh you're gonna you're gonna have to you're gonna  have to find it on your own but it's uh it was uh it was a song done to uh the blondie song call me 
[00:19:30]  yeah okay that's about as much description as we can give but it says i think we could say instead  of saying call me they were using no no i wouldn't you can't even say that i wouldn't  wow i definitely wouldn't okay yeah see how scared we are petrified absolutely i'm petrified here's  the new story don't dump imus they'll dump anyone he made a lot of money for the company yeah some  call it racism on the radio a song played in a local radio station that left some people upset 
[00:20:00]  and this dj out of a job he goes by the on-air name of kid chris and tonight the shock jock  familiar to so many in the morning is off the air susan it was part of his job to push the envelope  but clearly executives at cbs radio believe kid chris stepped way over the line  kid chris was a paid shock jock complete with goofy antics like hallway jousting  but now his edge has cut him out of his job as a morning dj on 94.1 wysp 
[00:20:30]  he had chris whose real name is chris foley was fired by cbs radio on friday over a song performed  on his show on march 21st the song performed by a guest reportedly had several racial slurs in it  several played several times that day it was yeah several it was just full of  yeah full of uh racial uh terms and then uh a little more to it a spokeswoman for cbs radio 
[00:21:00]  released a statement which in part says quote we found the song to be highly offensive and  completely inappropriate for broadcasts on our airwaves a wysp sponsored birthday party for kid  chris set to take place friday night at the whiskey tango in northeast philadelphia  was canceled by the radio station disappointed fans who showed up anyway contend the firing of kid  chris was unfair the show that that's all it is it's a show if you can't enjoy it you know jc channel 
[00:21:30]  i didn't even know anything about it so it's kind of a shock oh but neither kid chris or his agent  offered any sort of official comment today concerning his firing you know it is a show and you should be  able to say and do whatever the hell you want on the radio as far as as long as you follow fcc  regulations but yeah it is so obvious that the climate is is such that yeah you just got to play by the  rules or go do internet radio simple as that yeah because we even got thrown off satellite radio for 
[00:22:00]  for you know for something that happened for a month and something we didn't even say right and it's  frustrating it's frustrating that uh imus would be fired for what he said we completely don't agree  with it you know to be honest i don't agree that the kid chris should be fired but in this day and age  and and how the climate is you got to be careful got to watch everything you say that's um god i hate  listening to newscasts like that because i just i know what it's like to be on the receiving end of it 
[00:22:30]  yeah and you're just sitting there all depressed and you hear the fans going like oh you know if you  don't want to hear it change the channel and and it just doesn't mean anything to you because you're  fired right right it's like it doesn't even feel good that they're supporting you because you know  you're just fired anyway well we used to be like you know newbies to this whole firing thing yeah so  you would you would hear the news reports of some fan you know sticking up for you by saying exactly  that and you're at home like completely devastated like what the f am i going to do next with my life  and you're thinking to yourself well maybe uh maybe corporate just heard that newscast and uh 
[00:23:00]  maybe that'll uh knock some sense into that if enough people say that man no you're fired you're  done the reality is it's it's over they've moved on hosed it down and that's it i would imagine he  would end up uh on serious with howard because they seem to get along so hopefully because i don't  want to see him out of work that's for sure no that sucks and you know funny dude man he does a good  show yeah and uh you know a lot of people were asking me questions this weekend and yes we're we're 
[00:23:30]  we're discussing you know we're discussing going back on in philly we'll see what happens i'd love  it you know we don't have a deal right now as we sit here but there were uh phone calls being made  uh all day yesterday and they don't like talking on weekends in general so so that's a good sign  we want it we want it bad but we felt like we should have never been uh taken uh out of that spot  yeah but this guy john cook thought he knew and uh obviously his true colors are being shown and i will  say that i don't give a crap who's listening down there in philly and disagrees the guy was a bad 
[00:24:00]  dude simple as that he was just a bad dude we definitely have reason to uh not enjoy his company  all right we uh just getting started another week of fine radio what's gonna happen this week on the  opian anthony show every week it's something chimney cricket what a sofa for this show is  and uh our phone number is 877-212-018 we'll take more of your phone calls after the break opian anthony  you're checking out the opian anthony show phone number 877-212-018 it was a very busy weekend in

[00:28:30]  kennedy's have been to this country and another one has died ted kennedy blah blah blah blah blah and  they'll show all the the uh they'll show his brothers and yeah well yeah we're trying to get more info  on that but uh now they're just saying a seizure instead of a stroke which is uh a lot different the  guy's a fat drunk i mean come on oh god look at that picture wow ted you've let yourself go 
[00:29:00]  oh i thought that was tim sabian uh oh oh how just made five people out there laugh that um love  you tim you think that would have been like jfk i think he would have of course down to that point  it could happen to brando it could happen to anyone because i mean jfk you know you think back there's  the young president cut down in his prime something to be said for that sometimes james dean yeah because 
[00:29:30]  it's like that i mean because you look at ted kennedy and my god well they ruin the older you get you  just ruin your image i mean that everyone just ready marilyn monroe yeah there you go her image is  intact because you know you're not looking at her as an old broad yeah like going to hollywood you know  uh hollywood uh openings and stuff you think of some women that were sex symbols back in their day  shelly winters she was actually a sex symbol hubba hub uh what's her name that one that did murder 
[00:30:00]  she wrote um angela lansbury angela lansbury used to be like a hot sex symbol back in her early days  in hollywood now you're losing your mind no no i swear she was they they looked at her like a hottie  what was shelly winters a sex symbol besides a poseidon adventure but she was she used to get a lot of  uh hollywood um she had a lot of she had a lot of uh mail callers as they said back in the day 
[00:30:30]  mail callers call it mail callers i'm calling now we call it good old yeah and the big yeah the deep  but uh yeah she was she was one of them to answer your question yeah if jfk made it to old age he would  look pretty much like his brother ted caddy yeah maybe a little thinner but uh pretty much the same  because ted was kind of ted was a thin guy wasn't he back back as young i think he was like uh a little  bit chubbier than uh was he than uh john and robert after the second brother in five years took a pop to 
[00:31:00]  the head he's like nothing to see here boys i'm just gonna eat yeah yeah side of the table trying  anything yeah screw civil rights screw everything i got i got the message don't have to worry about me  anymore don't don't worry i'm just gonna sit out sit uh sit over here and get fat uh in other news  too you got obama 80 000 people showing up for a rally in oregon wherever this guy goes he's a rock  star he's like bono he's a rock that's a u2 concert jesus 80 000 people in oregon west so you get a lot 
[00:31:30]  of uh liberal thinking uh people there i mean this sounds like one of the bigger crowds but he's uh  getting crowds wherever he goes yeah but not like that that's the hugest crowd but that's not  impressive that's so typical of uh his constituency they love him up there i wonder how many bigfoots  though 80 000 people but how many big foots up there in the pacific northwest we're in the rally 
[00:32:00]  we're at the rally i should say and he now what is actually insensitive it's sasquatch sasquatch  sasquatch yeah i got a sasquatch american i want to sing no what sasquatch american and obama now  has a 20 point lead in super delegates super delegates and then in the most disturbing news  over the weekend uh this jason giambi admitted that he's wearing a golden thong to get out of a  hitting slump or something it was on the front page of the papers yesterday like deeply disturbing 
[00:32:30]  just take steroids he openly admitted just shoot up some steroids please well this is how desperate  these guys are without their roids i'm starting to think now they're wearing women's panties and  stuff because you know he would say that it's a guy's thong but just the word thong means girl  yeah you know someone out there explained to me that wearing a thong is not like women's uh  underwear a banana hammock is that like a thong though i don't know that's a speedo they call 
[00:33:00]  speedo a thong is a speedo is pretty brutal but when you get down to the thong that's women's  underwear yeah he would say no it's a it's i bought this from uh a men's store or whatever but golden  thong i'm sorry you're wearing like chick stuff to get out of a batting slump and you're all and  then you're admitting it to the press what is what kind of goofy thing is that just practice more  wait jeter and passada admitted that they're wearing golden golden thongs too well that's hot but uh  what a bunch of sissies huh and johnny damon admitted to it as well they've all apparently 
[00:33:30]  got some sort of uh oh that's good golden thong wow same one right eroc yeah what's going on in  the locker room what does it involve a cracker they're passing so we're in the same one the same one  shut up shut up are you serious no way no that's really i wouldn't surprise you those superstitious  idiots athletes are superstitious idiots nothing is worth like putting on someone else's underpants 
[00:34:00]  homoerotic that's disgusting yeah uh jason giambi and his magic golden thong the key to turning the  yankee season around could be under jason giambi's pinstripe pants the yankee slugger reveal friday he  slips on a golden lame uh lam lamé i guess right lamé thong with a flame line waistband when he's  trying to get out of a hitting slump and he shared it with his teammates it works every time giambi  told the daily news after his seeker was outed on portfolio.com derek jeter agreed that giambi's 
[00:34:30]  thong works although it's so uncomfortable running around the bases what the hell are these guys doing  i bet it chafes i bet it itches uh i had it over my shorts and stuff he said i was 0 for 32 and i  hit a homer on the first pitch that's the only time i've ever worn it i think that's what uh jeter  said uh johnny damon also admitted donning the golden panties see say they're even calling it panties  uh probably three times what's the secret of giambi's golden thong you're not worrying about your hands or  your balance at the plate damon said you're worried about the uncomfortable feeling you're receiving 
[00:35:00]  oh so you're not thinking about what you're doing too much right because that's like a secret to golf  if you think about your swing too much then and all the technical things that go into it you're just  going to suck it's got to be kind of a natural thing and i guess hitting is the same thing you don't  want to concentrate on the the technicals how does it feel that your team wears panties uh anthony um i like  it i think it's sexy it's hot yeah bunch of dopes uh in the early earlier interview with portfolio.com 
[00:35:30]  uh giambi claimed he also hung his thong in the lockers of teammates bernie williams robin ventor  robinson uh cano when they had trouble generating runs i don't robinson cano cano sorry i only put it  on when i'm desperate to get out of a big slump giambi said whoever is on slumps puts it on catcher uh  posada admitted yesterday i don't know if it works i haven't worn it yet posada added that a lot of  players have worn it but he didn't name names asked if the thong got washed between wearings he 
[00:36:00]  gave a cringeworthy answer ask jason said posada jason is a little strange yeah and then finally  the article goes on and on but uh one more part here giambi said the thong gets washed between  wearings he's had it since 1996 when he played for the a's he said the company that provided him  with undergarments made it for him as a joke he's been sharing the joke with his teammates ever  since that's a weird joke man it's a joke the lucky undies were hanging in his locker yesterday  you've uh got to come and ask for it he said that's the way it works so it's hanging there and 
[00:36:30]  then you have a batting slump logo could i have your golden panties yeah jason uh i need to wear the  panties tonight i'm over 82 i'm desperate don't want to be sent down that's fantastic sorry but the  red socks are not wearing thongs gonna take a little shot at your team today anthony well you know  something anything the yankees can do because uh they're they're sucking last place right yeah  last place the curse is that jeter was very rude to me that's the problem don't worry it's may 
[00:37:00]  you should stay in last last place yeah the mets even got him huh the mets even nailed him well the  mets aren't doing much better so they were supposed to do uh a hell of a lot better than  they're doing doing a little better than the yankees they they beat them oh i know what the  the subway series is happening yeah uh yeah an abbreviated subway series too straight yankees  20 and 24 you got your red socks at first place in the east uh 27 19 and where are the mets uh 
[00:37:30]  where are the mets the mets are 22 and 19 so a few games out of uh the top spot in the nl east  because the yankees started doing what they used to do in the 80s which was getting these stupid free  agent johnny damon stop it's all farm system guys bring up the young guys slowly work them in that's  what they don't like doing that they want to they like building a a team uh which with what they  think are yeah superstars so they they spend a crap load of money and uh they get people that are 
[00:38:00]  either past their prime or a flavor of the month or something like that damon had that buzz going  you know after the socks uh won the series and steinbrenner was like i get that guy on the team  right let's say hi to joe in philly joe what's going on hey guys how you doing hey happy birthday  jimmy thank you sir you're welcome uh do you know what oh but i know that you marry your you're going  to marry a philadelphian but you really don't have to support our team honestly the penguins were the 
[00:38:30]  penguins are just a better team you know that well yeah francis are a hell of a lot quicker and  everything else and they're going to have their uh run for them when they're going to go up against  detroit sooner or later here i'm sure they're going to take care of dallas but right you know  i still don't want your support but all right i understand that but penguins were definitely the  better team uh out of that matchup and let's not forget that uh the celtics moved on they beat the  the calves in uh seven games so uh yeah that was uh surprising was it i don't know was it 
[00:39:00]  hey lebron james left it all out on the court my friend though he had i think 45 points he did  his job in game seven see even i know about lebron lebron james i know he's you know king  james king james he looks like he's 35 years old and he's i think 19 20 at this point what a bizarre  looking i know he's uh he's very good yeah it's a lot of points he's a crybaby and his mom is a  budinsky he's not a crybaby what are you crazy why why do you call him a crybaby i don't know i just 
[00:39:30]  that's what i heard oh that's that's that's not smart once you call suge knight a crybaby while  you're at it hey i don't know what he was doing he was knocked out exactly laying there on the  ground he could have been weeping a million dollar offer for a rematch between him and that guy in  vegas yeah people want to do something like that they'll have a rematch they'll ring the friggin  bell he'll shoot him it'll be over i win i'd take one punch in the face from suge for 500 000 yeah  yeah why not god not that he'd want to do that it's embarrassing meaty hand of his one shot 
[00:40:00]  break my jaw i drink soup for six weeks and i got a half mil that that situation's not over  that's gonna end up to somebody david iowa what's up hey uh yeah i was just calling to uh tell you  that that uh giambi thing was the same thing as uh tim robbins over there in bull durham yeah some of  these uh baseball superstitions actually if we could find it the paper i think it was on saturday did a  whole what all these guys used to do a lot of facial hair well there's some other people that 
[00:40:30]  don't change their socks and stink up the whole locker room there were a few i never heard of  before like i think it was one of the necros like lined up like nine opie necro oh sorry jesus christ  what am i thinking uh let's write a song uh lined up nine cigarettes yeah and after every inning he  would have a cigarette after every inning and then another guy wow that's that doesn't sound very good  you got to find the list because then there was another guy that ate licorice and after every 
[00:41:00]  inning he like would spit it all out brush his teeth and then start over again okay that's crazy  yeah i meant to bring this list in i i forgot it at home but if you can find it you know some of his  mouth i i he would just eat liquor i don't know a certain amount of licorice and then he would have  to brush his teeth in between innings and then start over again wow yeah that's that's kind of silly  you know you heard about the guys they don't touch the lines and all that that's the basic stuff but a  few of these guys were really out there we'll find the list we'll have it after like ocd stuff 
[00:41:30]  almost they get into right of course they have to do certain things what weight bogs ate chicken  every day or something like that leave the house he had that that clock thing where he wouldn't leave  the house a certain the clock had to be on a on an odd number before he left the house i think they  also said i might be getting all my info messed up but he would wait till 16 minutes before the game  or an hour and 16 some weird time and then he would do wind sprints but he would wait to the  specific time before the game started and that's a problem that's a mental problem we'll get the list 
[00:42:00]  because it was very very interesting how about this when the ball gets thrown don't miss yeah there  you go how about that hit it that's a good superstition yeah just don't stop swinging over the ball or under  it connect with it and run quickly you know problem solved right that's when we get in a slump with our  radio careers and it's like someone decides we need to wear thongs it's not happening thank you  might work it's so bizarre i like it wearing thongs grown men wearing thongs and now one call by the 
[00:42:30]  way now one guy defending the the male thong i'm sorry no of course they could call it the male thong  they could call whatever they want it's it's it's women's underwear a thong is uh yeah for girls  all right 877-212-0&a opian anthony  you're checking out the opian anthony show  past freddy writes on the instant feedback is tony getting jealous meaning you anthony 
[00:43:00]  tony when the hell have i ever been called tony i don't know holy mother of christ  he goes is tony getting jealous watching little jill nicolini with those indy studs  indy studs they look like uh uh fruits is he in the studio with these guys right now  and and let me tell you something indy guys aren't known as uh manly guys uh indy and nascar are two  different things the the the audience is two different things they they nascar guys don't like 
[00:43:30]  indy racing it's it's fruity they think what is she wearing she's very smitten with the indy guys  she's wearing she's got some competition my friend a little racing outfit yeah what is she doing  there's your girl on tv interviewing the indy racers that was a sign of loyalty to anthony she  didn't want those creepy drivers staring at our cleavage oh there you go thank you jimmy that's a  good way to to spin it that's for sure she zipped right up toward our neck absolutely yeah that was 
[00:44:00]  good a saudi arabian woman her man's not there  a space suit she looked like she's wearing a space suit yeah it's awful  oh they were mittens and a big hat on you rock they were calling it a space suit too no she says i  don't know why i'm wearing a space suit oh really no she knows a suit she doesn't want to blow with  anthony no yeah she's doing her job uh yeah speaking we're both in broadcasting 
[00:44:30]  jimmy mentioned saudi arabia well uh yeah i've read this over the weekend a 50 year old saudi woman  asked for a divorce after her husband lifted her face veil while she was sleeping for 30 years the  wife says she never showed her face to her husband in conformity with the traditions of her native  village wow after all these years he tries to commit such a big mistake the wife told the saudi  newspaper blah blah blah after she left the house in total disbelief she said the husband apologized  and promised never to do it again he just wanted to peek at what he's been married to for the last 
[00:45:00]  30 years to him must have been like that's like seeing the taint yeah that's like uh when the when  the the panties slip off yeah for the first time well it's like it's not it's not islam it's like  there's like these really weird villages that get really uh it's like a weird tradition in some of  them and uh there's like uh this one woman they said uh she's 70 and the husband her children have  never seen her face what is that about pushing goes and holds hands with them why don't you is it a 
[00:45:30]  religious thing yeah it's gotta be some kind of traditions i think i don't think it's about  tribal because her quote was marriage is about love not faces there shouldn't be tribes in 2008 or  village whatever it is i could be wrong should be tribal stuff how about this it's stupid thank you  it's stupid stop doing it hey going back to giambi wearing that golden thong so we found some of  these on his face they could peek under it yeah we found some of these weird baseball uh superstitions 
[00:46:00]  yeah uh and man some of these are weird danny said the last one is the greatest thing he's ever heard  but uh we'll get there in a second we got to start with uh greg swindell remember him he was a pitcher  well this is what he would do he would bite the tip off one of his fingernails before each start  and then he would hold the nail that he bit off in his mouth for good luck for the entire game  be great if he inhaled it just lodged in his windpipe how weird is that every game let's go to jp jp what's 
[00:46:30]  up hey what's up man i was just watching jill uh while you guys are on break and she was totally  flirting with those guys asking i'm like oh what would a girl have to do to get your uh race guys  attention oh no she wasn't she totally did you could yeah yeah i have somebody that saw a call in  too somebody else saw it no way she doesn't want to play she wants to make sure you got competition 
[00:47:00]  just in case you're thinking you this is going to be an easy one oh really is that it oh yeah  that's it man punch it out guys she thinks those guys are sissies because she was probably telling  him you know what my boyfriend drinks and then drives that fast  more baseball superstitions john schmaltz uh who once was doing jumping jacks on the clubhouse during 
[00:47:30]  an atlanta braves rally was afraid to stop because he didn't want to be held responsible for the end  of the braves scoring rally so he ended up doing jumping jacks for nearly a half an hour ass well  what do you do in that situation you stop well that's what most normal human beings would do but  these guys are extremely superstitious uh la russa uh who received a death threat while managing the  chicago white socks in 82 that resulted in him wearing a protective vest la russa uh covered the vest 
[00:48:00]  with a warm-up jacket and when the socks rattled off a winning streak he kept wearing the jacket  even after discarding the vest wearing a vest uh larry walker it's a bulletproof vest yeah larry  walker is obsessed with the number three this is just ocd here he sets his alarm for 33 minutes past  the hour takes uh practice swings and multiples of threes wears number 33 was married on november 3rd at  3 33 p.m bought ticker bought tickets for 33 disadvantaged kids when he played in montreal to 
[00:48:30]  be seated in section 333 at olympic stadium his last contract his last contrast his current contract  included a joint three million three hundred and thirty three thousand three hundred and thirty three  dollar donation to children's organizations in british columbia and colorado finally he has three  kids yeah that's that's just crazy yeah that's that has nothing to do with superstition he's a nut 
[00:49:00]  that's ocd how about someone says to larry uh no what about that larry no just give him a four  and you want to round it off how about 35 disadvantaged kids there's two kids missing out right because  he's a nut because you're obsessed with the number three yeah three gaining because they only wanted to do  yeah good point oh okay jc jersey think of it the other way my glass half empty kind of guy  hi what's up uh it actually is part of islam that they do cover their faces i know and okay and in old 
[00:49:30]  um an old india they used to uh wives would used to light themselves on fire before their husbands  died i like that it'd be a lot easier if they did it like right after the wedding save the husband  and headaches so how do you know this you sound like a little kid well i'm actually 13 and my stupid  history teacher has been yelling this at us for about four months now so you're listening in school 
[00:50:00]  that's good why aren't you in school oh i've heard it so many times i've kind of got used to it why aren't  you in school still early what no actually commuting right now but commuting wait i never said i was  commuting when i went to school dude i drive 40 miles you don't drive who's driving you mommy or daddy  daddy and why do you drive 40 miles to school i don't know they wanted me to go to some private 
[00:50:30]  school oh bad neighborhood oh no uh daddy have money uh not really no you sound like a pretty uh  privileged kid there 40 miles private school is it an all-boy school no it's not oh that's good  all right glad to hear it thank you jc for the info maybe he's not a very bright boy and it's a  special school oh like one of them retard schools boys weren't very bright yeah that's what you call 
[00:51:00]  it too it's the not very bright boys everything's lined with rubber because they're just dumb they  you're just stupid things edible doorknobs in case the lad chews it a bunch of little fools  here's a spoon to eat your meat with because you're dumb can't give you anything sharp nothing  sharp it's just the first bleeding child they had to get rid of all the knives and forks that's  right it's a school for not too bright boys no one wants to go there so they tell them it's private 
[00:51:30]  40 miles away from everything yeah it's in a cabin in the woods uh wade boggs moving back to the  superstitious baseball players we know about his chicken thing right yeah so he ate chicken before  every game uh this one starts with where do we begin with wade boggs he ate chicken before every  game woke up at the same time every day took exactly 150 ground balls in practice took batting  practice at exactly 5 17 and ran sprints at exactly 7 17 every single uh day before a night game or 
[00:52:00]  whatever his uh route to and from his position in the field beat a path to the home dugout and he drew  the hebrew word some symbol i don't know chai meaning life in the batter's box before each at bat  boggs is not jewish by the way he always uh ended his pregame infield practice by stepping  in order on the third second and first base bags stepping on the baseline taking two steps into the  coach's box and trotting to the dugout in exactly four steps what a nut yeah that's crazy what a nut 
[00:52:30]  and what would he do if he grounded out to third like wouldn't i tell you the ritual is not good  yeah it's not working you would think yeah you would think uh and if these rituals worked wouldn't  he still be playing baseball it wouldn't be about losing your skills because you got older  the gods would be taking care of you uh one of the most unusually famous superstitions came from  former reliever turk wendell he chewed okay this is the one i was telling you about he chewed four 
[00:53:00]  pieces of black licorice when he pitched spit them out after each inning brushed his teeth in the dugout  and leaped over the baseline described as a kangaroo hop when he was on the mound wendell stood if the  catcher was squatting and squatted if the catcher was standing all right why sex wait a minute that  could just be that he's a real like he's either given or getting at all times right he just does 
[00:53:30]  the opposite of what the catcher does oh my turn your turn my turn we saved the last uh the the best  two for last finally the best one they're saying the best one comes from a little known player named  kevin romberg his superstition was the need to touch back someone who had just touched him  like tag during recess in uh grade school uh the need to touch someone back was so necessary that if  a person somehow eluded his return touch romberg would send a letter that said this constitutes a  touch what 
[00:54:00]  uh let's say hi to scott in jersey scott oh gee i meant to say right scott is that what you're saying  uh yeah man all right i'm sorry gee right you're obviously not uh jewish i guess huh  no actually they spelled it you never know by his spending habits  that was very hurtful i know but necessary that constitutes a touch all right thank you sir  and finally rick sutcliffe once reached under a bathroom stall listen to this one 
[00:54:30]  this is the one that danny says is uh the greatest thing he's ever uh uh read  rick sutcliffe once reached under a bathroom stall to touch romberg on the toe  not knowing who did it romberg so this guy drilled a hole in the stall right and touched him back  so obviously rick sutcliffe was was just messing with this guy because he was a lunatic yeah all  right so once again sutcliffe uh reached under a bathroom stall to touch romberg on the toe 
[00:55:00]  not knowing who did it romberg went around the clubhouse and touched each player uh brook uh  jacoby once once told of tagging romberg with a ball in the minors then throwing it uh out of the  stadium uh jacoby said that romberg spent two hours looking for the ball before finding it  an umpire once halted play during a game in new york to tell yankees uh players to stop touching  romberg that's funny he could he probably could have been the greatest baseball player ever but he 
[00:55:30]  had ridiculous ocd that is amazing romberg we got to learn more about romberg what do you got danny  turk wendell's baseball card turk wendell's baseball card where it looks like he's putting a nail in  his mouth he's just he's brushing his teeth we're brushing his teeth oh this is the black licorice  guy oh all right yeah yeah brushing his teeth his baseball card shows him uh with a toothbrush in  his mouth a turk wendell brushing his teeth card limited edition 
[00:56:00]  wow yeah look at that what a kook let's let's go to south carolina  chocks prince what's going on hey nothing how you guys doing today doing good bro happy birthday  thank you could you please use the word urinate thank you i heard that a moistest alone when he's  with the chicago cubs he urinated on his hands before every game yeah i'm hearing that wow really 
[00:56:30]  yeah a few people are saying that today why would you do that i don't well because he never used  gloves so i guess that's why i don't know he probably had a mistake in the bathroom once and  went six for six yeah there you go hit for the cycle twice or something in the same game something  ridiculous happened he said whoa there might be something to this and since you can't guarantee  a sucky pitcher he's like well this i can control yeah exactly oh god well thank you prince we 
[00:57:00]  appreciate that well not many high fives going on with him though uh both uh new york papers  talking about the new uh indiana jones flick what is it called the uh the temple of old  kingdom of the crystal skull kingdom of the crystal skull i saw the trailer for it yeah uh looks pretty  good and like he doesn't look as bad as i thought he would no he's some of that hollywood magic i guess  that'd make up magic he's aged pretty well he doesn't look like an old guy well no i've seen 
[00:57:30]  pictures of him where he's out with his emaciated girlfriend there a wife right uh and uh he kind  of looks old yeah you think so yeah well uh the the front page of both papers uh what it was shown in  con con and uh it's getting like three uh three stars yeah getting really good reviews and we're lucky  because we actually have in the studio somebody that saw the new indiana jones the new indiana jones 
[00:58:00]  movie i thought no huh no not quite what not quite what i thought maybe we had indiana jones here  oh yeah but no uh roland he's not doing radio but he says he's come back in december to plug a book  on the show he said i come on the show i said okay when december's book what everyone's always coming  back to plug another project well it's good well it's very good yeah it was good it was a good  movie dude you're one of maybe well i don't know but there's not many people that have seen this 
[00:58:30]  movie yet you gotta give us more than it was good no it's like a krista or a karen allen she looked  old in the movie karen allen well karen allen used to be uh america's little sweetheart back in the  70s early 80s yeah that's the only thing in the film you shock like oh like oh every time she was  on screen you went oh yeah it was it was good it's like it's was she was she playing the sex pot still  or they yeah no she was no she's the only one that in the film where he goes there she is the love of 
[00:59:00]  my life and every time you just went ew yeah but it was a good movie though it's oh takes place in  nevada in 1957 1957 is the year okay i was wondering we're wondering about that all right  that's good so no nazis huh uh russians of course it has to be the russians the safe russians russians  uh commies so they're fighting commies cold war kind of stuff kate blanchett plays the evil villain  evil villain yes kate blanchett so it's and then shia laboe plays the like the mini sidekick 
[00:59:30]  mini sidekick well do they explain what happened to short round no why don't they tell us what  happened to short round they only explain what happens to his dad that's about it oh well obviously  he's dead yeah this is all you got everyone's looking forward to this movie what it starts  thursday it's gonna it's just gonna set all sorts of records he's archaeologist he looks for things

[01:00:30]  what's the crystal skull all about i was reading an article about that over the weekend like the  minds but they're actual crystal skulls and they say they he quips it does he quip  i think they did a documentary on the crystal skulls over the weekend i didn't see it yet on the  discovery channel stump ring what do you got on this supposedly these crystal skulls is like 13 of  them and they hold the secrets of the universe or something legend has that there are 13 crystal  quartz skulls and if they're lined up the secrets of the universe will be unrevealed and decoded for 
[01:01:00]  us all there's eight of them have been dug up and they're trying to find the other five i have the  screen if you want to see of that history of the crystals oh i thought you meant you had the screener  at indiana jones movie no one has i don't see that we're the history of the crystal skulls we want the  freaking movie he t-vote something and copied it for us yeah thanks i wonder where these quartz uh crystal  skulls made they speculate that they were developed by either the mayans or aliens and given to the 
[01:01:30]  mayans oh i vote for the mayans yeah i would too but what's creepy about these things they are perfect  human skulls yeah it's creepy open and close yeah wow and they're made of in indiana quartz right  crystal quartz crystal quartz and uh how old are they uh they're speculating on on thousands of years  but there is one of them that was the last one that went up for sale was found in the 30s i think  wow they must go why are they selling them if it's if they hold the secret 200 bucks that's the 
[01:02:00]  argument they've nothing who sold it no response never should have been sold i'll tell you what  happens you line up all 13 you go ah look at these 13 heads and you sell them nothing happens of course  not if i had the money i'd buy one and smash it on the sidewalk and say now you're not gonna learn  anything what do you think of that stupid people we are this is a wholesome magic power it doesn't  yeah it's 13 heads you'd be like wow look at them no in the movie now in the movie um did they 
[01:02:30]  revisit yeah because i hate when they do this do they revisit any popular scenes from past movies  like when indie uh that guy has a big sword and then he pulls his gun out and shoots him classic  it's a classic scene like they don't try to pull any of that crap how about snakes other snakes they  do that once the snakes snakes and he says i hate snakes he goes i still hate snakes no he goes uh and  then he can just like that yeah he continues he looks at a camera he's like what's wrong he just 
[01:03:00]  like looks at the camera you're like oh so you chuckle like oh boy he hates those snakes i laughed  yeah oh you laughed because like he it's the inside joke like look you the audience knows that  i hate snakes yeah so i don't even have to say it i just have to give you the look like you know i  hate snakes i got you did you enjoy the movie i did i did enjoy the movie does it uh compare to  the other ones the trilogy yeah it does i mean raiders is just a classic i worship raiders but  oh you worship awesome it's my favorite movie of all time like candles and stuff sometimes 
[01:03:30]  you got a little altar in your apartment yeah i just love the raiders but it does does at some  point does he does he reach under some closing door and narrowly uh uh gray like just in time  grab something from underneath it no but he slides through oh okay but he slides through at the last  moment right all right did he die at the end of the movie no of course not don't ruin it no they're  already talking about a sequel they're just trying to come up with an idea or no i shouldn't say a 
[01:04:00]  sequel another one george lucas is a character and how about harrison ford has to tie him down  and shave his beard so he can stop trying to pretend he has a chin his face looks like a balloon with  just hair in the middle of it he does he stops shaving at some random point to make himself  look like he's got a chin yeah like he doesn't know where to stop there's no line most people stop  where their chin where their jaw meets their neck or something he has no idea where that is  looks like a fleshy exclamation point that's what his head looks like with just beard hair in the 
[01:04:30]  middle like if you shook him his head and neck would go just flub so there's our there's our review  from roland yeah amazing there's a few surprises oh a few surprises really well don't ruin those  yeah what what can those those to be ruined surprises say it's good did you yeah good it's good  did you see sex and the city yet uh no are you going to no you have to yeah it's a job i will see

[01:12:00]  i ain't got 70 days  because there's nothing nothing you can teach me  that i can learn from mr hathaway  you're checking out the opian anthony show let's not forget about onaradio.com now being 
[01:12:30]  updated as the show goes uh that's very very good news and uh look for steven s from bayshore's  show rundowns later on in the day all on onaradio.com nice uh mike huckabee who used to be a candidate for  the presidency of the united states of america had a bit of a faux pas at a uh nra convention  oops getting a a lot of talk today yeah you heard about this one oh yeah what do you think he well 
[01:13:00]  he was uh trying to be off the cuff funny and these guys why just shut up why can't he be fired from  politics now yeah because if we try to be off the cuff funny and we slip up we lose our jobs yeah these  guys i made a mistake that's all right you know he's like yeah uh he's just off the cuff it was  something that uh he wasn't planning on saying got caught up in the moment and said it we can't use  that excuse no ever have to be on a guard all the time i guess he was up there talking at a nra 
[01:13:30]  convention someone either fell down or something happened in the audience that made a noise where  everyone was like what the hell just happened yeah so he reacted to that by uh saying this and we darn  sure would like for it to be less expensive torn but the reality is and i'm worried because  frankly within the that was barack obama he just tripped off a chair he's getting ready to speak and  somebody aimed a gun at him and he he dove for the floor wow and then you just hear like the silence 
[01:14:00]  and a couple last but mostly what did he just say this is a bit uncomfortable for everybody just made a  pointing a gun at the presidential candidate joke he got greedy here's what happened that was barack  obama he was standing he's getting ready to speak he felt gotta laugh gotta laugh move on fell down  move on tie it in with the event yeah yeah you know i'm at a gun event let's bring him let's bring up  guns and presidential candidates yes and a very real threat the guy's the biggest secret service uh 
[01:14:30]  protection yeah detail amazing it's good oh i just don't know when to stop there's no real backlash  because he doesn't really have a job to lose no it's not like uh he's still running yeah so if he  was they would jump on that but no one cares tel aviv bus bomber drove in well oops what what did i say  idiot people talking at nra conventions usually do say stupid things it's um well tarleton has to 
[01:15:00]  really makes it look bad my god man me being a card carrying member i understand that i uh when  are you gonna talk in one of these they're gonna have me up there they're gonna ask you to talk  locally i'm sure they have local events and they're gonna they're gonna get you that'd be nice what  would you say in front of the nra people say everyone should have guns that's what i'll say that's my  motto guns for everyone whether you want them or or not i was at anthony's house over the weekend  and uh yeah and i saw firsthand that you do indeed carry while you're walking around your find uh abode 
[01:15:30]  well i was going to the range and then uh and then i was just too scared to hold any firearm i'm like i  don't trust myself with with freaking guns i'll be scared i'll be scared of you see how i held it i was  like i know i held it like it was oh we hold it like it's evidence yeah between the thumb and  forefinger just kind of no joke holding it up he doesn't want his prints on it you psychopath  right maybe that's it exactly and then it was uh disarmed or whatever and then you had loaded yeah 
[01:16:00]  and then i kind of gave it a little feel nice weight to it yeah it's a good thing about a gun  just feels good in your hand doesn't it doesn't it feel good a nice gun but i always i'm very i'm  very safe i've been around guns my whole life i understand that always point it down pop out the  magazine open it up i saw lock it and then hand it to the person uh in a completely unloaded open  position uh opie holds a gun like and holds a baby that's uh coach mike stunt brain yeah 
[01:16:30]  coming up with that coach mike coach mike yeah we're gonna call you coach you're gonna have to  start walking around the show with a whistle oh yeah if you don't have a whistle by tomorrow  you're fired sweatshirt and a whistle and you know we could do that because this is like a  temporary thing so you better wear that whistle better wear that whistle tomorrow coach mike  coach mike's pick of the week i don't want some kind of like notre dame baseball uh baseball hello  notre dame like football cap on yeah or maybe a local high school maybe we could have like the

[01:18:00]  and hopefully no one would be in the way of the ball oh god that's why i can never have one  i'm a klutz yeah you have to constantly be aware of what a condition loaded unloaded is there even  a magazine in it out is one chambered is it not what you have to constantly know exactly what  condition your your gun is in yeah absolutely at all times speaking of guns you go to the gun  range because i left you and you say well i'm going to the gun range of the range off a few rounds pop a

[01:22:00]  keith keep the cop all right and i saw keith's room and it was creepy it looks like he's living there  it looks like he's got enough stuff there where he's living there one maybe two days a week and he's  on it looks like he's on the lamb yeah he's like on the run it's a flop house he's got a flat screen  that's not on the wall it's kind of on the floor up against the wall and he's got his playstation 2  i think yeah he gave him the old playstation because you got the xbox yeah and his bed was made  yeah it was creepy and there were some clothes like in piles on like slippers he's got like slippers 
[01:22:30]  there i don't know what's going on on that that side of the house i don't go there but he's definitely  taken over this room yeah he has it's not like it's a guest room and he just has some of his stuff in  there no it's keith's room it's keith's room it's turned into keith's room i have no doubt about it  anymore yeah so well and i was thinking once the the painters leave and they take all that stuff out  of the maids quarters he could take that little room downstairs but he he won't have that and my 
[01:23:00]  streak's alive by the way every time i visit anthony's uh house i do a little something something i i  would suggest that keith checks his bathroom the next time he's over oh no because i know anthony's not  checking the i don't know 12 bathrooms that he had i don't check i i tell the maids to make sure  they flushed all the toilets well you might want uh keith to check his bathroom you better not have  left anything in there i'll kill you that was believe that was the latest gift i left at uh at  your house opi's thing is to uh go in a different bathroom every time knowing that you're not gonna 
[01:23:30]  like discover what uh i may have done i certainly hope you didn't leave something in there of course i did  good for you if you had any gut you'd do it on the keith's pillow  little treat back to the gun day where reporter sarah butteson went to date night to find out how  firing a few rounds can rekindle your romance let's be honest goggles and earmuffs aren't the  sexiest look but here at the shooting your muffs where some of the couples are coming to connect on 
[01:24:00]  friday nights the sound of gunshots the smell of gunpowder and romance are all in the air at range usa  who think you're going to be at home friday night is date night at the east memphis shooting range  i plan to be here every friday yes that's creepy i don't think you want to find  your girlfriend at a gun range a little romance yeah but then the then the uh you know the 
[01:24:30]  relationship goes bad and you know she knows how to work a gun she knows how to shoot i mean you know  women are capable of some crazy stuff but you don't want to like introduce like guns into the equation  they're really good with frying pans and household items you don't need wow you don't need to throw a  a few guns in the mix nice misogynistic way to put it that's why uh you know that's why i i always  wear my gun around the house too it's another reason why because uh if you leave it somewhere 
[01:25:00]  like in a drawer or on the dresser something like that other people can get it but if it's on you it's  on you i uh i don't want anybody disgruntled i don't want to give too much away you but i saw a  collection all legal by the way i'm not trying to say that oh yeah everything is on the up and up  with anthony but i saw i'm not even going to say where but they're all laid out really nice like  one after another like going like you would do shoes like yes like if you do care about shoes 
[01:25:30]  you would have your shoes all lined up your sneaks your dress shoes whatever right yeah you had your  guns lined up like that and i want to know why uh i said that it's like um it's uh accessorizing for me  like i look and go what gun do i want to wear today what gun do i think i'll wear the walther  380 today it's nice it's a little smaller and some days it's like nah today 45 yeah i'm definitely  wearing the uh the 45 yeah yeah the sig that was creepy and then the other thing that was creepy was 
[01:26:00]  uh i opened up one door and quickly closed it because i didn't like what i saw in there oh  all on the up and up again but i'm like wow are the sandinistas uh staying with you now are they  living with you i um yeah that was my rifles my rifle collection yeah with everything you could  possibly need with the rifles and i noticed that light did a lot of ammo oh yeah and the light didn't 
[01:26:30]  work we opened up this uh door and quickly closed it like okay hey let's see how the pool's coming  turn the lights on and show you you know i don't know there's a lot of stuff in there i lost track  a lot of ammo it looks like it looks like a survivalist's like vault what childhood nightmare  are you protecting yourself something you know it has to fending off it has the workings of a panic  room yeah yeah it really does you just need like the protective door and uh you know metal doors or 
[01:27:00]  whatever and you're you're set to go uh a little more on the date night at the gun range assistant  manager kristen bauer says date night started a few years ago couples of all ages uh all ages kind  of all walks of life they come in some are younger some are older uh they find they would like to do  date night instead of going to dinner and a general movie firing a few rounds together helps her and her  husband wrap up their romance yeah it's hard to leave the range and then go home and go right to bed 
[01:27:30]  you're alert you're awake and you know really you could leave here and go and do something else  for fun continue the date night what makes love last can be a loaded question at range usa there's  a sure shot answer the couple that shoots together stays together doesn't rhyme 39 bucks the couples who  come here get two meals two boxes of ammo two targets but just one shooting lane so they can stay at close  range to each other of course these couples stay together they're both paranoid as as f 
[01:28:00]  who's gonna make paranoid who's gonna make the first move i don't think this is working out  draw exactly it doesn't uh doesn't mean you're paranoid i don't know that sounds good  that sounds like a fun fun night you would you would find your next girl at a at a gun range  no i don't think find but i i would take a girl to a gun range oh that's different in the past but 
[01:28:30]  these girls sound like they are a bit experienced with the guns to begin with yeah no i wouldn't do  that it's like taking a girl that hits some golf balls it's kind of fun but you know they're not  real experts good at it kind of showing them your whole the the golf club for a little bit and show  them how it's done and i could see you could do that with the guns but this story makes it sound  like they're very experienced with the guns yeah yeah it sounds like they both are into it and  that's like they're going there you're going there and then you're meeting you know you're  meeting these people on site let's go to nate in brooklyn nate hey guys hey hey opie yeah within a 
[01:29:00]  few weeks he's going to meet a girl at the gun range they're going to be running around like mickey  and mallory in natural port killers hey that's a good reference no silly it's not weird that you'd  meet a chick at a gun range i mean you know you've already gone through high schools and news stations  yeah where are we at with jill nicolini any any communications uh going on during the show  i'm not tipping my hand you're pretty much taking this off our radio show all of a sudden well people  want to know what's going on i'll just uh if you weren't listening earlier we did news we did give the

[01:30:00]  you know dinner so what day should we take off this week because i've heard some things that she  might be the female version of you no sounds like she might have some late nights before she does  her traffic and we used to joke about that in the office but now because we got some intel uh she  she might be very similar to you my friend she uh well she's from long island so what day wednesday  says enough right there what what show do we need to take off wednesday thursday i'm thinking friday 
[01:30:30]  i won't uh i won't say thursday would probably be a really good night to go out i won't say  i'm gonna just give us something i'm gonna clam up about this until uh it happens after the fact  how funny would it be though if she doesn't want to have sex with him all she wants to do is throw  radio show ideas at him like that's the whole what are you talking about sex come on you like this  girl like let's say that you think that it's a romantic interest just like oh my god and then  you guys got to do this and just throws all these awful ideas you got to smile for dinner and then 
[01:31:00]  she's like all right i'll talk to you later but it's like a real buddy buddy thing there's no  just bad radio ideas even worse a couple weeks go by and you come to us and you're like  guys i really think we need a female angle on the show i think that it's the missing piece to our  success i'll come to you and say that i know we've been fighting this for so long but i'm really starting  a few i mean she's not like every other girl or broadcaster i really think she could be one of the guys 
[01:31:30]  with boobs yeah that'll happen just look at it as one of the guys with boobs that'll happen look  out like it's eric sorry i think uh i think we should give this a shot and we really have been  lacking in the uh female i really think she could bring something to the show i went and saw sex in  the city and it wasn't that bad yeah we went and uh saw it and i got a good angle i just want to bring  her in and maybe talk about the movie and we'll see how it goes if that happens you're um you're 
[01:32:00]  free to break into my gun collection and use it on me oh it's too snacky yeah dude i didn't even  want to like get too close to them it's going like yeah take a look ah yeah uh let's go to woody  in florida woody hey oh we can find out how anthony's date goes on lazlo's show yeah no kidding  linger live yeah book lazlo for a radio show so we could make this guy talk because for some 
[01:32:30]  reason he doesn't like talking on his own radio show he likes talking about this stuff on other  shows sorry or start uh drinking bud lights during the show and we'll get that we'll get so much info  out of you it's not even funny let's go to joe on long island joe hey i want to know if uh anthony's  closet looks like arnold at a commando you know he's got a key in jill's last four digits of his  telephone number and uh access is gone i you really should put some kind of uh locking device  on that you know that that place i saw my uh panic room it was a little it was a little creepy a 
[01:33:00]  little scary they're very secure and i want to say once again all on the up and up but a bit obsessive  with this collection they're very secure to say the least i i like my guns they're fun and i do have  to say it again you do take it very seriously oh yes which was good to see actually i thought you  were just like i'm spinning them around like a like a western watch this fool throwing loaded guns 
[01:33:30]  around all right we gotta take a break uh when we get back uh wow did george takai really get  married over the weekend oh yes yes uh because i guess what you could get married in california  now so yeah they passed that gays yeah yeah well george the gays george takai got married and we  got some audio mccain on snl just goofing on the fact that he's old oh really he's got a sense of humor  about that but but he's still old yeah and that's something that does bother potential voters that he's 
[01:34:00]  old it's good that you make fun of that but the fact is you're still old it all depends on who he  picks for his vp you think i think yeah all right but uh you know given the uh given the choice  i think a lot of people vote for old white guy old white guy yeah i don't know i think you might  be surprised this time oh yeah 80 000 people at a rally yeah it's a lot in the pacific northwest 
[01:34:30]  doesn't matter that's a lot of people for anyone to get out to a rally that's true republican in the  bible belt wouldn't get that many people out to a rally oh you're right but you just gotta win states  are they gonna vote though yeah they come out to a rally i'm sure they'll vote well that state is so  democratic you know that's a democratic state oh yeah yeah they're all hippies they're all hippies  there how's all cookie dough legs doing she uh she's still hanging out she's so finished why  did she just hang it up she's got no momentum at all none well she's except literally she's got a 
[01:35:00]  lot of momentum she's i'm glad you asked she's in kentucky uh she talked in front of a crowd that  wasn't as big as obama's and she's saying that she has uh the overall vote lead that's what she's  saying today what does that mean i don't know but obama has 20 uh point lead in the superdelegates  so which i guess is really important now those two because they just they just invented yeah  they just came up with it this this election i guess just to make sure that uh that uh the citizens 
[01:35:30]  of america don't vote for the president we like to think we do but in the end you know i think it  started getting scary so they had to come up with superdelegates now to make it even more complicated  never have i heard that word and we said it last week if they wanted us to vote for the next  president they would have the election on not a tuesday yeah they would have it on the weekend  yeah the weekend and not not like at eight o'clock on the weekend they'd have it around  noon one o'clock wake up go to starbucks and and then vote not on a tuesday and the worst day of 
[01:36:00]  the week easily you wouldn't make your prize for voting you get jury duty yeah exactly that's so  true yeah oh you're putting our system now oh you like to vote well guess what you can also uh  learn to like jury duty you're right that's one reason why i avoided voting for many many years i  didn't want to be part of the system yeah put in the big computer for jury duty they pull you out of  and make you sit in jury duty plus they make you go to like a smelly school or a church basement 
[01:36:30]  they just they just make it just awful they don't make it like a they don't pick a happy place and  they don't have music playing just to kind of make it festive because we're you know make it a little  festive you know to be able to do it from home you don't think they know how easy it is to vote  nowadays yeah they're avoiding all that they want to chipper it up they ought to incorporate genital  torture making a more enjoyable experience exactly stale cookies in a church basement with old ladies 
[01:37:00]  that are just volunteering because they're bored living alone somewhere yep on a tuesday  yeah thanks and you're you're in this really long line because they don't open enough places because  because they want to deter you as much as possible yeah they don't want people coming out they know a  lot of people if there's a long line they're going home ah i wanted to vote but ah too much of a hassle  who's they by the way who are the they the illuminati right were you testing me yes i was and i passed the 
[01:37:30]  test yes you did the illuminati bill burr paranoid test look at the dollar bills say no more say no  more yeah go to youtube and look at the dollar bills it's all right there for you it's all spelt  out all scary stuff the illuminati illuminati i'm surprised they haven't found the crystal skulls yet  are they looking they probably have the last five they're bowling with them knowing the illuminati  they allowed us to find eight out of the 13 crystal skulls and they got the other five and 
[01:38:00]  they're just laughing at us we're all puppets because they know no one will ever find the the  remaining five so no one will get the secrets of the universe my friend no secrets of the universe  for us no opian anthony good morning to everybody it's the opian anthony show eight seven seven two one  two o-n-a we got uh john mccain on snl but we also have curtis leeward taking shots at us again 
[01:38:30]  is anyone even listening to care to curtis leeward yeah i don't know to be honest with you he's just a  douche i missed took over his uh his slot he was expendable i think they moved him to like when is he  on he does some weird schedule over at abc radio here in new york who knows he uh he does 5 a.m to  6 a.m live live okay and then he has to come on again after you warm up for imus and he does 10 to 
[01:39:00]  10 45 because he has to be off for paul harvey he's imus's opening act wow he does an hour and 45  minutes between 5 and 11 yeah yeah horrendous and he's goofing on on us so wait he does the hour before  imus comes on before the big boy uh broadcast and then he does 45 minutes after imus's show so he  does like the the post game yeah he's a he's a locker room hack so what are your expectations for 
[01:39:30]  the big game mr imus given all the stats of imus's career blah blah blah blah blah then imus does the big  uh the big game real show comes on and then you do the uh the post uh the post interviews basically  the wrap up not good enough to actually play the sport that's what i call uh mr sliwa  but uh sue simmons i guess he went off on sue simmons and then somehow like made it about uh us  and trashed us sue simmons was the anchor everyone has seen the video by now she dropped the f-bomb 
[01:40:00]  it was huge on all the uh viral video sites dropped the f-bomb and she skated she's gonna be fine  she's not gonna lose her job no uh this is what she had to say about sue simmons simmons apparently  is known after anchoring the 5 p.m newscast and the 6 p.m newscast at channel 4 going for a liquid  dinner either at gallagher's state house or john george's in columbus circle many of the clientele 
[01:40:30]  say that she gets happy and by the time she's half in the bag and jumps in a cab to go back to nbc  studios to do the 11 o'clock broadcast she is toasty as apparently she was the other night once  he let the f-bomb slip what's wrong with his voice there's a lot of dead air he pauses to try to think  of what he's going to say next so in order to shorten it down to something we could play  uh how do you do that you got to take the gaps of dead air out  oh dude you should give us the original track i want to hear all that uncomfortable dead air 
[01:41:00]  all right i'll go it sounds like he's uh putting novocaine in his coffee or something  because it sounds like he's he's not opening his mouth enough when he's speaking  uh and then he went on to us for some reason sue simmons well no disciplinary measures have been taken  so far but remember the actions taken against arthur chin who was out on the street and dropped the f-bomb  on live tv after uh opian dopey i guess i'm dopey i'm always dopey you have to be dopey again 
[01:41:30]  why do i always have to be dopey just that's pretty hack i mean can't you come up with something  opian better than that one they've been using that since our opian ain't funny  that was kind of clever right yeah yeah after uh opian dopey the degenerate two of  talk radio in the mornings uh fm ruling the house because they're freaking morons feeble-minded 
[01:42:00]  fornicated madly and uh free marijuana that's why fm stands for that well opian dopey  some of their listeners their sickle fence toadies and lackeys out to various uh sites in which um  uh newscasters would we only met uh sli was sli was once and he was nothing but nice to us yeah  that's always the way some event back in the day it's a character he does i did uh handling combs with  him he was asking questions about the walk over to satellite he had all these questions he not one 
[01:42:30]  and he was actually he goes i call him opian dopey like and he kind of laughed like it was a fun  funny thing he does is it it was silly what are you doing what an ass character  sites in which um uh newscasters were doing stand-ups uh and the whole idea was to interfere  with their broadcast you know to get shits with opian dopey and they cost arthur chin his job he got  fired meantime what opian dopey got a pay raise the schmucks that they are oh schmucks that we are 
[01:43:00]  yeah you know what if you're in radio you know that our assault on the media contest was actually a  really really good idea yeah you do know that it got us it was it got us press it got us a lot of  press and the arthur chien thing we didn't get him fired he cursed he cursed he couldn't keep it  together i guess if we weren't there he would have been fired but no but i mean anybody but obviously  something else was going on with arthur chien that day and then we were the last straw because he didn't 
[01:43:30]  even pause before he said what the effort is what the f is your problem who's the bigger schmucks the  guys who are doing well with a guy who does an hour before i miss and 45 minutes afterwards that's  an awful time oh boy did he take a dive what day what time are you on well well let me explain this  and how many times did you have hercuma jerks oh who would try to interfere with your broadcast  not not not screaming not like the opian anthony thing with arthur chien right well that's why 
[01:44:00]  who's that guy he's got one of those not like the opian anthony thing wait he does a 45 minute show  and he has to like share with a news guy it's the second hour yeah they have a news guy in there with  him it's not the second hour it's this it's the second part of the show which is 45 minutes  not counting like uh commercials he probably talks for what 30 minutes after imus yeah he has a newsman  in there who uh reads the news stories and they riff back and forth with each other sounds like magic 
[01:44:30]  sounds like magic right well that's why i'm bringing up people behind me doing this and you  know chanting and that kind of right and everybody forgets arthur chin good report trying to distract  you lost his job because opian dopey those two degenerates morons here's a channel two then right  right freaking morons feeble-minded fornicating madly free marijuana fornicating madly do you understand  what he's saying and this is why he he he shouldn't even free marijuana what this is i'll explain what 
[01:45:00]  he's doing and this is why he shouldn't even have a 45 minute radio show he's coming up with things  that that's what that stands for that 45 minutes 45 minutes there you go  ah take that forgot that one curtis oh that's funny  oh what he's coming up with things that fm stands for yeah and he thinks this is clever it's stupid  trying to distract you lost his job because opie and dopey those two degenerates those fm morons 
[01:45:30]  he was a channel two then right fm morons freaking morons feeble-minded fornicating madly free  marijuana foul-mouthed would get this free marijuana what does that mean does he think we're we come  in here stoned man every day that's that what we do because we're degenerate yeah man fm five in the  morning i don't like that one curtis 
[01:46:00]  oh that's hilarious oh m stands for mafia so we could go down that road too  he had a little incident didn't he yes he did didn't he almost got uh killed there  foul-mouthed would get their sickle fans to go out there and interfere with a broadcast  right found your music and then they would get their jollies off on them they signed million-dollar  contracts arthur chin lost his job because he threw the f-bomb at those opian dopey ites and he ended up 
[01:46:30]  with a pink slip you know what uh at the time it sucked for arthur chien to get fired because of what we did  absolutely but in the end we did him a favor no one knew no one knew who he was he got a lot of  of exposure because of the assault on the media thing we did he was like uh he was one of these  niche reporters that uh reported on just like uh the mta like some stuff he was he was niche  yeah he wasn't even on all the time and he fought his firing by the way and he won his case and it was 
[01:47:00]  determined that they should not have fired him for what he did and then he turned around and got a  much better gig and people know who he is now why so as much as he went through that and that that  that blows obviously he became better for it hey look do they care does the media care when they get  people fired they do nothing legitimately sometimes but other times they don't care about  the legitimacy of it as long as they get the coverage so they don't care what they do to  people's lives and no one here got him fired he got fired because he threw the f-bomb out he  tried to get gangster uh what the f is your problem man the guy wasn't poking him he just didn't 
[01:47:30]  like that his broadcasters interfere with you're doing a live broadcast outdoors it happens too  bad yeah even if even if you don't have a radio station doing like this assault on the media thing  like we did there's always somebody trying to mess with your broadcast whether they're throwing up  gang signs or like behind you pushing into you because they're trying to wave and get their face on  camera yeah you know our guys actually were very polite they would it was then he he could he  he wasn't even excited to be there if you've ever heard the tape no oh yeah 
[01:48:00]  oh like he was just in the background not really uh pushing you know pushing in in into uh  arthur chan's face yep i have the curtis sue simmons clip with the stutters and see eric he blew it  you made him sound like much better this is the the clip we just played the original clip without you  messing with it yeah well track one wasn't really the important one that's what i understand but  the same sue simmons clip where it was like dot dot dot this is the original clip okay listen to this 
[01:48:30]  simmons apparently is known after anchoring the 5 p.m newscast and the 6 p.m newscast at channel 4  uh of going for a liquid dinner either at gallagher's state house or john george's  in columbus circle many of the clientele say that she gets happy extraordinarily happy 
[01:49:00]  and by the time she's half in the bag that's a maddening pace yeah maddening like a building  captain kirk delivery to do the 11 o'clock 11 p.m broadcast she is toasty as apparently as apparently  she was the other night once she let the f-bomb slip wow and and then look at the audio file it  looks like a perfect heartbeat the pauses are like like perfect wow you made him sound much better why 
[01:49:30]  would you do that not for the in the important clips i left it but for the one that wasn't to  set it up i i trimmed it down yeah dude he's talking like he has a four-hour show you better get to it  curtis you better hurry up there you'll be off the air in eight minutes yeah chop chop you better  hurry up there am boy what does am stand for let's play his game okay can't say that you can't say  that either no all right uh george takai moving on george takai i'm married yes i'm married

[02:02:00]  earth to anthony yes to anthony yes hello um could you do me a favor with this jill nicolini  thing yes i have like a make-out session on a couch somewhere what yeah do something a little  different a make out old school go old school with this jill nicolini i think she's she's worth  it you know she's worth a make-out session like a long on a couch a long make-out that's wonderful  i'm sure she's thrilled to hear that where your legs are getting all tangled and and this karate moves  going on because she's not sure she wants you to go to second base yeah i remember junior high 
[02:02:30]  that's all you're describing here is yeah go back to junior high for a weekend and then you leave the  house and walk home in pain yeah just one of those out of control make-out sessions and then yeah  and then just hold back a little bit until the second date and then you know have hardcore sex  here we are there great  yeah so you you want to go downstairs in the basement there's a couch and a ping-pong table  bring back the dry off what do you say what do you say you can't what do you say bring it back 
[02:03:00]  did it ever really go away and just tell like your mom that you need her basement for like the night  so mom's upstairs anthony what are you doing what's going on down there nothing mom uh nothing  um we gotta be quiet  turn the music up louder yeah okay this is good you like that you like 
[02:03:30]  all right well i'm not really sure i i don't know you that well yet  oh it'll be okay let's just sit over here on the couch we're just gonna sit right yeah we'll just sit  on the couch okay here drink this don't mind that sediment on the bottom  you think i should yeah yeah i brought over some uh 151 nice i brought over some 151 a little pint of 
[02:04:00]  it yeah just do a shot it's cool there you go no i'll take a bigger swig than that that's good okay  no i'm drinking it too look bubbles are coming into the bottle see as you blow bubbles into the  bottle but don't actually take a sip so you don't get drunk and they get smashed  my old strategy until it backfired on me and i got an angry call from a father at 3 30 in the  morning saying why can't i wake up my daughter oh that was a bad one statute of limitations is up on 
[02:04:30]  that yeah but jill's listening oh this might years ago this might turn her on though maybe this is  exactly what she needs to hear yeah that was a bad one why can't my daughter i just wanted to hang  the phone up and run away like it didn't happen yeah all i was thinking is i'm going to jail for a  couple of things are you i didn't know she was a statue statue are you uh are you almost done with  your mixtape oh yeah yeah yeah anthony told me in the office he's making a mixtape for jill i'm gonna 
[02:05:00]  make a mixtape for a mixtape should we like uh maybe that's what we do tomorrow with this whole  thing have the listeners help you out with your mixtape yeah because every budding uh romance needs  a mixtape although now it's just like you borrow their ipod and you throw some songs on there for  them i think uh probably like keep it funny and put in like jimmy hendrix crosstown traffic  and some some songs by the band traffic no i think the listeners could do way better than that 
[02:05:30]  and and really oh yeah i'm not sure i want him to do what florentine did years ago he made a  mixtape for his girlfriend and he put in like filthy dice bits in between each song it was like  these really nice these really nice songs with just filthy dice bits so she couldn't listen to her  friends oh that's hysterical that is really funny uh steven s is like are you kidding me jill will  bring her own bottle of 151 i think you're in trouble with this one man you're why i think you might  be in over your head with this jill nicolini why all right uh we went off on a tangent but jimmy 
[02:06:00]  definitely has a problem with the uh well no we didn't it's all connected actually because uh  the tmz style promo is all about jill and anthony by now you've heard the news someone over at the cw  11 is single and looking for a date that's right it's magnificent piece of ass traffic reporter jill  nicolini the long island native famous for relinquishing her 2002 miss long island crowned 
[02:06:30]  after being discovered that she posed in playboy called the radio program yesterday to confirm  rumors that she is single and looking to date co-host anthony cumia so far so good jimmy yeah  okay you're the cumia huh although the way you said my name looking to date anthony cumia  yeah yeah you kind of did all right it's like kathy yeah kathy kathy kimi i was being hammy  hammy anthony cumia my quote directly to nick was that i'm single these days i heard anthony single 
[02:07:00]  and is he available gee i wonder how this could go wrong maybe he'll take her to the local gun range  where he'll show up his mounting arsenal that's going to get him a visit from the atf  or perhaps they'll just catch a movie we've heard downfall is on and it's anthony's favorite  he always cries at the end stop either way 
[02:07:30]  it's the cuckoo clock oh that's okay the cuckoo clock  you're calling anthony crazy by using a cuckoo clock oh you know what you blame you can blame  derrick for that one because he he's all past the buck yeah if if if there's a production issue you  can pass the buck to derrick because he's the one that uh scripted that and uh produced it not to be  nitpicky i enjoy the piece sure the cuckoo clock yeah is it uh danny yeah i just want my stomach hurt no  i just want to defend derrick for a second this is supposed to be in the style of tmz reporting and 
[02:08:00]  that's the kind of crap that they do oh do they yeah they pop in like that's how they report  they pop in some crazy yeah he's not he wasn't doing that to be goofy he was just he was just  trying to parody a cmz style report okay fair enough i stand corrected fair enough sir fair enough  i still hate it but that does let derrick off the hook all right there you go we look forward to the  next one working on all right working on it working on it working on it working on it  and uh finally we fit is released ladies and gentlemen the we fit is released we fit wow

[02:15:30]  i wasn't sure when i said it that should be fine  and if anyone ever thinks the fcc is going to levy a 300 and some odd thousand dollar fine for the  word boner uh they're insane it just wouldn't happen just cowardly white lawyers when you look at  every violation that has actually gone to a fine uh something as as innocent as that 
[02:16:00]  has never been fine of course not  hmm but again lawyers jobs are not to fight for you or they're just to kind of  make your own jobs easier that's it all walks of life that is it absolutely  you don't mouth to god's ears  it's funny i was looking at two sticks of butter in a pantsuit  and i realized it was campaigning

[02:19:30]  some candidates and it doesn't work for others mccain of course is he's not afraid of the fact  that people are calling him old he decided to take that on on snl this weekend good evening my  fellow americans i ask you what did we have an s did we have an open anthony uh fan in the audience  good evening you heard that right yeah that was where was that from snl wait was good evening from out 
[02:20:00]  here oh was it out there that's funny i had done it to travis as the door was closing oh  shit you just freaked me out that's funny guy heard it too like good evening it sounded like  it could have been in the crowd at snl good evening god i wish i wish you didn't tell us because we'd  have played it back it wouldn't have been there and i would be like wait a minute we would have  been freaked out i heard it too good evening michael americans i ask you what should we be looking for in  our next president smooth stupid certainly someone who can read someone who is very very very old 
[02:20:30]  but just as important we will need a leader of courage and principle someone who is willing to  do what is best for this country even when doing so is unpopular such as putting an end to runaway  government spending  he really kept the funny going he sure did go for the laughs wow he went for one laugh and then  he was talking about policy how about we have to do what's necessary like telling people to put 
[02:21:00]  sweaters on and shitting our pants yeah he's going to tell us how he has avoided unnecessary spending  as he continues my friends i've fought waste and government my entire career and during more than 20  years representing arizona in both the house and senate i have not once sought to bring pork barrel  spending back to my state not even highway funds when i entered the senate in 1987 arizona had 47 000 
[02:21:30]  miles of paved roadway jesus christ this is boring it's less than 900  that's funny my fault just took a while to get to an hour to get to i've also opposed federal water  projects even when they benefited my state that's why thanks to me 15 of arizona citizens must get  their drinking water from cactus 25 years i haven't even brought a post office to my state 
[02:22:00]  and i'm proud of the fact that because of my work when residents of flagstaff want to mail a letter  or to pick up a package they have to drive to new mexico  he's hysterical sure is wow  how about if i was a woman i'd be starring in a video uh that stresses hat removal 
[02:22:30]  because i have hair just like her it's poofy and sockable it's sockable my friends controlling  government spending isn't just about republicans or democrats it's about being able to look your  children in the eye or in my case my children grandchildren great-grandchildren great-great-grandchildren  got it and great-great-great-grandchildren the youngest of whom are nearing retirement 
[02:23:00]  and tell them we have left you the same thing we were left a future free from debt  as your president i will guarantee it all right i just don't want him to be president  how can you after that i don't want him to be president he doesn't have a funny bone in his  body saturday night morgue yeah it's just awful i have the courage the wisdom the experience and

[02:41:00]  oh that's a good move if we're painting a bird house  well wouldn't you be exactly color's the eagle's nest  stink  ah he rocks here cool what's uh what's the scoop don't put him on hold because i don't want him  to hear this uh just to bring everyone up to speed uh we had to take out all the dead air 
[02:41:30]  like um irak edited this together so we could get to the point with curtis lee walk because  there's a lot of uhs and dead air and shit but he basically had this to say about us when he was  discussing the sue simmons cursing on the earth thing sue simmons well no disciplinary measures have  been taken so far but remember the actions taken against arthur chen who was out on the street and  dropped the f-bomb on live tv after uh opie and dopey the degenerate two of talk radio in the mornings 
[02:42:00]  uh fm ruling the house because they're freaking morons feeble-minded fornicating madly and uh  free marijuana that's why fm stands for that well opie and dopey sent some of their listeners  their sickle fence toadies and lackeys out to various uh sites in which um uh newscasters were  doing stand-ups uh and the whole idea was to interfere with their broadcast you know to get  chits with opie and dopey and they cost arthur chin his job he got fired meantime what opie and 
[02:42:30]  dopey got a pay raise the schmucks that they are oh and how many times did you have herkima jerks  oh who would try to interfere with your broadcast not not not screaming not like the opie and anthony  thing with arthur chin right well that's why i'm bringing up people behind me doing this and you know  chanting and that kind of right and everybody forgets arthur chin good report trying to distract you  lost his job because opie and dopey those two degenerates those fm morons here's a channel two 
[02:43:00]  then right right freaking morons feeble-minded fornicating madly free marijuana twice foul-mouthed  would get their sickle fence to go out there and interfere with a broadcast right and i mean and  then they would get their jollies off on it they signed million dollar contracts arthur chin lost his job  because he threw the f-bomb at those opian dopey ites and he ended up with a pink slip pink sock  say what all righty now we're waiting to get him on there's the setup hurry up because we got the 
[02:43:30]  mcgregor thing to get back to you yeah we'll see how mr mac makes out mr mac's gonna make out pretty  well it looks like huh uh what's up travis i don't know steve's just talking to some lady on the phone  right now oh really yeah this wasn't timed let's take a picture of the day you're gonna block out of  your memory take a picture so you can remember it uh yes steve oh you'll love this what in between me 
[02:44:00]  actually talking to curtis sliwa uh he was able to get on the phone with wkrb in kingsborough uh which  is kingsborough community college who curtis now says has a bigger audience than us so he's gonna stay  on the phone with them rather than speak to you guys because he knows he's probably gonna get  killed on the phone here chicken shit yeah he had a chance he had nothing i talked to him and then and  then he and then he put his producer on the phone uh let it be known we're not the ones that backed  down on this one yeah we wanted to have him on have a discussion about what he said see if we're 
[02:44:30]  feeble-minded yeah uh because that's what fm stands for feeble-minded all right but it's like why  wouldn't you just go on the phone and just defend your point nobody's gonna scream at you just come on  dude yeah let's have a discussion it's just sucks well there he is it just mr guardian angel it  just sucks winning all the time that was a boring nice brave motherfucker that was like a one punch  knockout good good job oh well with his fucking beret with his i'm a tough guy beret oh well 1-800-848-WABC

[02:54:00]  i didn't know what to do i mean it didn't hurt  or feel bad but it made me so confused oh boy can hurt or feel bad there's not a soft older gentleman 
[02:54:30]  hand of course expert scoper hey where the fuck is mrs mcgregor mrs mcgregor how about you  yeah yeah you check up on your old man every once in a while enabling douche and then it ends with  this oh yeah that feels good doesn't it oh god wow whoa wow whoa oh that mcgregor whoa whoa 
[02:55:00]  yeah that feels good doesn't it it didn't feel good it felt gross i always thought i know what to do  in a tough spot but when it was happening well i didn't do anything  then it's your fault sounds like a bad boy i tried to act like nothing happened  what happened to me the pictures the touching he was wrong it was not my fault it's called sexual 
[02:55:30]  abuse no it's like a lot of monday morning quarterbacking in me  poor poor young lad what a what a problem how fucking dumb is this kid mr mcgregor winds up and  throws paint on him and he falls for it yeah how about you take off yeah leave the fucking uh shed 
[02:56:00]  he's fucking old old man hands oh god giving you fucking some relief jacking them off  liver spots yeah i bet you they're very i bet you they have dexterity on a penis though they're  probably he's probably an expert at jacking from that angle from the front you're like leaning way  down jacking in the front he's probably a professional probably wets his licks his hand first  oh god two yeah matt lamb writes i thought the kid was gonna say it didn't feel good it felt great 
[02:56:30]  i didn't like when he grabbed it i loved it we go to break with this today let's sneak a peek at a  filthy european guy with a 14 inch snake plumbing a girl who's way too hot for him while she's bent  over the bathroom sink today's boner is brought to you by rocco safredi's big mess  that's today's boner on the opie and anthony show 
[02:57:00]  what the hell's going on here 
[02:57:30]  awful awful awful they're just they're just awful awful people  you're checking out the opie and anthony show  did you guys want steve in here or something steve for what i don't know 
[02:58:00]  jimmy you wanted steve wasn't my bed it was danny's idea oh danny danny danny  here comes steve into his studio danny has an idea danny i want to make this perfectly clear  this is uh danny well i think we we need a prop for this bit because steve i noticed that when  you had come in earlier from cbs you were wearing your jacket and it looked like you were wearing 
[02:58:30]  baby clothes oh shit oh shit yeah go ahead no what's that oh shit what's your bit go ahead  i wasn't busy  i tell you steve is not happy what's your bit danny i'd love to hear it no no i'm sorry go back to do  whatever you're doing thank you what's this jacket doing here 
[02:59:00]  that'll be the second time i get written up i'm sure oh danny what was the bit because now  everyone's curious well you know we like to have fun around here sometimes we try anyway sometimes  it doesn't work i was wondering i was wondering if if steve would have been able to wait wait wait  before you say what you're gonna say i want to help you out a little bit notice there's two doors  so whatever door he runs into you might want to run out the other one 
[02:59:30]  no i don't even want to say because i know every time you know every time you bring something up  it just gets met it gets met with threats of physicality so i'll just i'll just go in the other  room  you have to say what the bit is now of course danny anthony's telling you you have to say the bit  this reeks of of sam and pat duffy oh well i don't know why is steve so upset 
[03:00:00]  well i don't know he's he's doing something steve why are you upset  i'll tell you why steve is not happy it's obvious steve  steve steve they're talking about you can you see him  steve has a shoulder or a back injury what he's coming just have him talk over there  right there no why are you upset steve we're just trying to have fun  i didn't sleep a whole lot last night this fucking neck shoulder thing is killing me 
[03:00:30]  all right so to be brought in on a bit today was not a good day i just i'm fucking irritated and  i'm actually really busy trying to get a lot of stuff done so i'm thrilled that danny thinks  that my clothes don't fit fucking do this another day so you would be up for doing it another day  uh maybe well i really i see it i see it in your face did i just spit up water  oh well basically well what's the bit danny well i i was lovingly calling it the zip up challenge 
[03:01:00]  no you don't want to do the zip up challenge i don't think you want to do the zip up challenge  i know because i would win i know it i would win  he is not well see sam i can zip my jacket up okay  oh so you're gonna zip up your jacket and then what we go around the room and see who can't  zip up their jacket are you insane oh that's fucking bad wait a minute 
[03:01:30]  are you saying that steve's jacket might not zip up his his jacket  it kind of looked that way before that that's all see i i gotta say say that um  steve's got his back and shoulder problem and he hasn't been able to work out and he's very  frustrated about that he's he's in hell yeah so that's why he's trying to take care of his 
[03:02:00]  back and i think he's probably a little sensitive about the subject and uh you know that's where he  stands so i don't think the zip up challenge is uh gonna be pulled off here today yeah  the rip danny's head off challenge may be complete but  danny keeps looking over his shoulder just waiting for him to charge in no that's fine  like a grizzly well danny we could do your drummer bit instead sure that's safe 
[03:02:30]  how did this we were talking about drummers and danny's a big fan of what drumming in general  well yeah you know i've i've i've picked it up over the years  why are we still cleaning up water was that it was because he spilled half a bottle on the  console oh hope he spilled some water why don't you take that shirt what do i do next  let's take some pictures all right to remember the day you spilt water and then cleaned you up 
[03:03:00]  i'm gonna be talking like that all day yeah yeah baby take a picture to remember what the day you  spilled the paint yeah the day i came in my pants  all right uh drummer bit what's this about there danny well it came up uh i forget how but it came up  about lars being one of the best drummers ever and i kind of disagreed and while i don't think 
[03:03:30]  that lars is a shit drummer i mean he's definitely in like the top 20 but as being like you know one  of the best drummers of all time i could probably name a few people that come way before lars and you  were saying pretty much that he's been overrated over the years you know with his double bass playing  as well you know because everybody everybody always they well everybody brings up the you know that that  uh part from one with the double bass and like oh man it's amazing and like when you really take a  look at it it's not all that amazing it's just it's pretty standard you know anybody that plays 
[03:04:00]  drums could could handle that beat it's really not it's really not so so complex i gotta say i think  we've already talked about drumming way too much yeah yeah when you think drumming what do you think  get i think of the last guy that gets laid in the band neil pert and then neil pert's pretty good  and then that other guy and you have an example of some neil pert i see that i also gave you an  example of phil collins it was it was a throwaway comment we're like yeah lars is an amazing drummer 
[03:04:30]  and so danny's like fuck you guys he's got part one technique and he lets a bunch of guys that he  thinks has good drumming all right part two is speed and part three is just lars well because i found i  found a jump solo of lars and you know it was a big portion of of a concert and it's like this  was his time to shine this is you can do whatever you want go lars it's all you you have you know  eighty thousand people well maybe not that many but you know you have thousands of thousands of  people watching you go and then that's what he did and it's just all right all right i'd like to read 
[03:05:00]  us well now i guess we have to so part one technique you got phil collins  starting up a firing squad this is phil collins yeah from when uh probably not too long ago he's an  amazing he's he is an amazing drummer kind of impressed but it's still that's just starting  though all right that's one guy 
[03:05:30]  what curtis lee was losing his mind why um it's still going i didn't stop it yet but  i'll bring the audio as soon as it's done um he he says you guys uh need to go back to the  midwest and retool your show come back with some talent he thinks we were never in the 
[03:06:00]  dude he had a chance to come on our show i know i guess the person getting to him  he yeah uh they were jamming the end of imus's uh show the phone lines and now  sorry they think we're the ones calling cursing saying put your effing boss on the phone to talk to  o and a they think steve uh they're giving out steve's full name they think he's in the mafia  and he's stalking curtis and now he's giving out steve's cell phone over the air he keeps repeating it 
[03:06:30]  oh get the audio it's still going the guy had a chance to come on our show yeah he says you guys  are stalking him steve's the worst that steve's was stalking him we didn't even know holy  steve called to get him on the air yeah he's fucking lied he yeah fucking lied he made his  producer late a woman live for him and then uh we found out he wasn't on the little radio station  he said he was on so steve called back i said steve call back find out why he said that when he's on  that station so steve called back and she goes well he told me to say that or something uh so basically 
[03:07:00]  he lied and we just called to go why did you lie oh my god what's wrong with saying come on the air  and handle it right thing right now he's just ranting right now with the news guy there and  he's letting his call screener girl on and she's saying oh but they have no ratings they're like  she's taking shots at the show now too the call screener what's the number what's the number to  make sure we don't have ratings if you want to call them and be on their show we should give out the  number first uh whatever to explain the whole ratings thing is whatever but i'll say this much  we're doing morning radio he's doing like infomercials basically between the real radio shows 
[03:07:30]  good for curtis he does it five to six a.m and then 10 to 10 45 something like that every day  10 11 to 10 45 10 11 to 10 45 oh wonderful all right get the audio immediately you should give  out his uh what's what's the number for a show how fucking weird is this we said call our show  we'll discuss this he doesn't come on our show and then he uses his show to trash us look we're  willing to go uh you know man to man with this whole thing yeah he was taking his dopey shots at us  calling us opian dopey and coming up with a hacky hacky uh monikers for fm or whatever all right back to 
[03:08:00]  phil collins  phil kicked some ass  he's a machine he sounds like he could be in pantera or lamb of god or anthrax any one of those 
[03:08:30]  type of bands i've never what song was that in the middle of uh susudio this is susudio i don't  know he did that i think you can't hurry love yeah some bad just some awful song poppy crap i think it  was from like he did some farewell tour a few years ago and that was just he just i guess in the middle  uh uh i that's talent but not impressed really you're more impressed with with with you know 
[03:09:00]  laura's i was impressed i was impressed with um i was impressed with sully's uh drum solo from god  smack but he was doing dueling solos and there was music like little riffs involved like just a guy  drumming i i don't know what you have to do to impress me but it's like obviously that's talent  but it does nothing for me that's like beer that's beer break time 
[03:09:30]  unless you're a drummer all the drummers sit there and watch everyone else goes for a beer  all right all right the next one is neil pert yeah  sounds like bill collins  everybody starts the same way  the drums aren't really a solo instrument oh there he goes 
[03:10:00]  yeah  we get it you can hit the drums  thomas overbeck from dallas writes is neil pert beating on his own tumors 
[03:10:30]  that rumor dude i i mean once again talent but i don't know it does nothing for me what song is that  from i don't know it's just like solo time at the concert yyz on exit stage left is uh neil pert's  finest work i just want to say that it's fantastic it's a lot it's very musical like so it might be a 
[03:11:00]  little bit more like he uses the drum sort of as much more music maybe we should pull some some  theremin audio hopefully the final one is uh tim alexander from primus and this is all technique  because the next category is speed yeah that's those guys sound like they're doing some speed  though yeah well yeah but that's just more of a broader you know like the the speed clips you'll  just see what i'm talking about when when it's just pulled for speed 
[03:11:30]  one guy  one guy 
[03:12:00]  what do you think yeah exactly you're texting  exactly i think half this bit is should be smashing me for handing in a bunch of  fucking drum solos in the first place well you're impressed by these drum solos though you put a lot  of work behind this all right here's uh here's a good drum solo that's speed that's fast that's 
[03:12:30]  right that's pretty much what you're what you're about to hear double bass  see he made it funny for everybody thank you anthony well part two is spam you got two quick  examples these are just like 20 yeah there's actually a listener helped me out with this uh  brett uh batdorf is that how you say yeah i'm not even sure about as blood runs uh black yeah i've  never even heard of these bands before a listener sent them in this is uh speed all out speed 
[03:13:00]  all right i don't think that's real but now i'm with you that's cool as  some some will claim triggers i think it's triggers it has to be right yeah this guy's 
[03:13:30]  saying it wasn't a trigger i've seen some ridiculous things now that's some  fucking digital magic that got our attention and then uh baby that's crazy you can't move your feet  that fast and then another example last relapse  my grandma loves this song now although that that i think that's probably a little more realistic 
[03:14:00]  as far as speed goes but like i've never seen lars do anything that fast i've never seen lars have any  kind of stamina like that keeping something that fast going on for that long right never he's a  great drum i'm not shitting on him the guy's great he's amazing he's definitely top 20 but not top five  well then finally you got part three lars this is lars this is lars doing his  did you find the lamest fucking drum thing no i swear i i i found this the same way i found i 
[03:14:30]  found the other stuff you know you just type in you know neil pert drum solo you know lars  allrich drum solo and this this is what i found now it sounds like a child now that sounds like a  child wait no it gets better you're just being a dick he does some sick shit you ain't never heard  before you're dick you're dicking fucking lars here i swear i think you can find some phil collins  where he's just like yeah of course just kind of casually banging the skins 
[03:15:00]  yeah  because when you're doing a drum solo you want to hear beats from other songs  just without the music over oh and not his fifth  and his timings all over there too  it's a master right 
[03:15:30]  all right i'm sold lars sucks he doesn't suck he's good he sticks on ice like that was his time like  everybody else like pert had his time to do you know to show off his his talents yeah and uh and  phil collins he had his time to show off his talents if we just played the phil collins track and you  said guess who that is no way a lot of people have no idea that he's a phenomenal john i would 
[03:16:00]  have that you just don't know after guessing well i only knew no like three drummers but after guessing  my three drummers i still wouldn't have said phil collins he's ridiculous butchers says do you have  a better example of lars nah i got lars i get this uh band fear factory his drummer raymond  herrera he's fucking sick  hmm does anybody want to hear what's wrong  he's still playing  wow butchie just wants to hear some white death metal i'm kind of dragging the song  and someone is saying those aren't triggers so now we can get into the uh the technical 
[03:16:30]  aspect of drumming really fast uh carl jersey what's up hey what's going on guys hey uh for  bands like uh his blood runs black uh those drummers can absolutely pull all that off because  i've seen them perform live and uh they're just absolutely amazing  matter if they're live yeah you can still use and do whatever you want live yeah  this day and age now everyone's talking about their favorite drum in the digital day and age  all right enough i don't think the mechanism in the kick pedal can move that fast 
[03:17:00]  there's like just something that can't move that fast where's he rock it's got a hit return and go  back i don't think it's going to surprise you use the balls of your feet because you're just going for  yeah how fast did you drum day not that fast yeah you're pretty he's been drumming for a year now  no i've been no i've been drumming i just got serious about a year ago but you know how are their  music i've been recreationally playing for a while what do i didn't hear you someone i just asked how  their music channels are nothing you said you got serious oh but ain't very repetitive

[03:19:00]  talking about us last week yeah like find the audio when people talk about us we want to see what  they're saying just makes for good radio at the very least so he played it and then uh we kind of  made fun of him not a lot even we didn't go off on a crazy rant and then we like get him on the  fucking phone we'll talk it out with him and steve came in and said i i could get him on immediately so  all of a sudden we waited for him set up the bid again and he he came up with some weird excuse 
[03:19:30]  there's talking to some college radio station right yeah and uh then steve called the college  station asking you know as a listener it's like when is uh i heard curtis is supposed to be on your  show today and he said no so he was lying he wasn't going on the other station calls back um curtis's  producer saying look is what you're lying he's not on this other show oh he's just busy right now  i'm scared and then he gets on the air and starts this rant when he could have done this on our  show yeah he could do it right now we could do it together you got any balls now to take you from

[03:25:00]  right and that amounts to we want him desperately as a guest blue healer is attempting to uh type  out freaking morons the way he said it and he has it as f-l-e-a-k-i-n-g fleeking fleeking and  morons is m-o-w-o-n-s morons i keep and they want you as a guest oh desperately they're calling every  number here at wabc and it's because they need ratings desperately because you know it's been 
[03:25:30]  reported uh in the journals that they're virtually on the edge of probably being liquidated fired you  know turned out yeah probably have to go back to uh some uh some place in the heartland of american to  perfect their craft and maybe who knows maybe they can recycle themselves back do you just hate radio  guys it's the blatant lying the uh the delusion that this guy is suffering from we we just resigned 
[03:26:00]  how are we on the brink how are we on the brink of of failure and being fired and this coming from a guy  that was expendable your company saw you as expendable they wanted imus more than they wanted  you and they took you off the air they took your show off and they gave you a few minutes here and  there to fucking probably just to eke out the rest of your contract talk about somebody who doesn't have 
[03:26:30]  much job security i think it's curtis sliwa right yeah yeah why would they just let him go and pay  him put him on 15 minutes here 20 minutes there let him fucking have to spend time you can't even do  anything in between there because you got to be somewhere what a fucking piece of shit gig you have  it sucks i mean i know he was getting good ratings in mornings too yeah to be you know we're going to  try to be fair here he was getting good ratings so it's got to suck that the company didn't believe in 
[03:27:00]  them enough yeah that they say well yeah you're getting pretty good ratings here but guess what  uh that we're hiring uh the big dog bringing imus in and sorry and what did he do he sat there and  took it instead of telling abc to go fuck themselves knowing that he does have a little uh rating success  and go somewhere else he's uh not willing to take that chance he's a chicken shit is what it amounts to  he's a lot of big bravado and talk but he's he's always just been a chicken shit he won't come on the  fucking show what would it take if someone said to you um you could continue working but 
[03:27:30]  you've got to do the five to six a.m hour then then wait at the radio station for four hours  and then go on at 10 to 10 45 if i had morning ratings like he had at that at that time i go  you fucking tell him to go fuck off yourself you go i'll get on another station i'll go head to head  against uh your man there and uh kick his ass right there you go that's what you do if you're brave  enough to take chances uh but obviously you're not what's the matter with your fucking uh the 
[03:28:00]  bravery yes that's under that beret yes boss whatever you need boss yeah do you get coffee  and shit for guys uh during that down time in between shows boy you're a rebel you get coffee  for the men yes boss yes boss whatever you need boss i'll do a 45 minute show every day yes boss  loser who knows maybe they can recycle themselves back but you know they're nothing more than howard  stern ripoffs they've always been that opie and dopey but times are really bad when they have to 
[03:28:30]  harass you and stalk you and call you up in fact you know organized crime task force of the fbi and  the nypd always ask me for anybody's numbers who is harassing me and stalking come on it's this guy  steve carlessi who knows which crime family he's associated we're returning that number over  everything have to be about the mob he's um actually is is he implicating steve as a mob hello  they call me steve the bear carlessi

[03:29:30]  steve steve we got a few fans on the steve this means danny sleeps with the fishes  steve curtis thinks you're in the mob yeah i'm flattered he's flattered that you're in  the mob you know i had an uncle that was uh that was a hitman apparently oh you know how sometimes we  point laugh this is not about that it's like we're all gonna laugh together here so calm down  curtis lee would think you're in the mob good for him yes i'm not yet i mean la cosa nostra 
[03:30:00]  the mafia is sponsored by foundry music exactly  i'm trying to keep my weight down i'm not supposed to eat so you can you oh  fuck can you i'm gonna still try can you tape the desserts behind the toilet  yes tape the desserts behind the toilet i'm hungry sorry steve 
[03:30:30]  steve's just scrolls i am done steve carlisi stop you're spilling it  you're part of the mob steve that's good yeah yeah it's it's you know i'm flattered that he  thinks that's better than everyone thinking you're gay well yeah i suppose i don't know it's  just the uh you know what pisses me off is the fact that jim jim said it i called the guy i got  him on the phone it would have taken 30 seconds to call him back and get him on the phone to talk 
[03:31:00]  to you guys and um curtis lee was a pimp yes and then you know and i'm steve the fruit  yeah it's just you know and then instead of going on the air and and talking he's got to  make up bullshit stories and it's actually the first time it's really happened in this business  and now i understand my radio guys suck what because this you've been with us 10 years is  the first time you noticed that these guys are idiots no no like that it's happened to me directly  like the guy did say i'll go on the air with him because he probably didn't know what to say 
[03:31:30]  yeah dear steve i hope you don't pop a staple in your stomach your grandson  no i've known radio guys are douchebags but now it's like the first time it's really affected me  now i'm like this fucking asshole implicating you yeah i didn't all i did was my job you  fucking prick i don't think he's allowed to give out your cell phone number no he's not so so are  you gonna sue him no no for what what's he got doesn't he live in the fucking studio that's the  point steve hold on and the capo yes we got uh uh footer footer yo what's up boys hey man 
[03:32:00]  i could picture uh steve walking in and going you don't come on the airwaves and speak to a man  like danny like fat everyone's doing it for me yeah well matt lafar from queensbury writes uh the  movie producer wakes up and his bed is full of steve's arm hair and eat up martha writes he was  putting he was putting on foundry logos two at a time 
[03:32:30]  uh what else all right let's uh get to the end of the sleeve audio you're a mobster  are you turning that number over oh absolutely i mean all morning long incessantly and if steve uh  twice holy shit twice in five minutes yeah that's you call them twice in five minutes one was can you  go on the air with opian anthony he said yes or one of his people said yes so then you called back  to make make the connection so we could have them on the air and that's when they came up with the 
[03:33:00]  excuse you call them twice twice in five minutes yeah that's fucking incessant what's this guy's  concept of time what a lying radio hack what a fucking lying radio hack they're all the same  they're all the same fact flirty flip i think i took a call in the newsroom they're actually calling  right now on the calling lines non-stop saying blank this and bleep that and tell your bleeping  boss to call these guys i'm like why no one listens why would we waste see if everyone's calling you 
[03:33:30]  and harassing and shutting down your radio show the you really shouldn't be saying no one listens yeah  because that's proving that people are listening to our show you dumb broad  that's a sad state of affairs so anyway i got 10 million listeners total total now on  on the satellite radio all right yeah but not to that show no no no i know no no that's howard  stern no no i don't why i don't i i'm a newsman that's for howard stern i'm a newsman i'm gonna get  a little edgy here curtis you don't have to kiss howard's ass either well maybe you do tell you the 
[03:34:00]  truth who knows maybe that's kind of the move you got to make since you're probably out that  fucking door once your contract's up yeah oh on the satellite radio all right yeah but not to that  show no no no no i know no no that's the howard stern i mean he's the king he leads uh  uh music channels i think music but look howard stern that's a guy that i've had a love-hate  relationship with at times he's given me counsel as a wartime peacetime consulary in the radio business 
[03:34:30]  oh is he the fucking enough with the mob references i'm fucking groveling you mouthed off one time too  many and someone tried to fucking kill you that's right there that's your experience with the mob  your fat fucking mouth almost got you killed end of story end of story end of story time she's  giving me counsel as a wartime peacetime consulary in the radio business because of my ups and downs and 
[03:35:00]  i really appreciate that because he's gone out of his way to reach out to me but we've also had  another relationship he threatened to shoot me one time on the air somebody else took care of it for  him exactly yeah but he's got listeners that's the mandatory that he brings that up like every  fucking five minutes what the fact that uh he was shot by uh the mob that's what i'm saying  allegedly our listeners thought we brought up sex for sam a lot this guy  has us beat right we get it that chick eric saying is flipper the fucking hole is that her 
[03:35:30]  or is that the screener that's her that's her for the whole uh she used to be hannity's producer  yeah well that's the one i talked to all right flipper flipper that's probably what  fucking that's probably what fucking black guys say when they're trading her back and forth it's too  much flipper too much of a load on one side flipper let it dry off and then we'll scrape it with a  spatula let's find a dry side potato flakes flipper flipper fucking stinks shut up hole just do your job  answer the phone be a good girl relationship he threatened to shoot me one time on the air somebody 
[03:36:00]  else took care of it for him exactly yeah but he's got listeners that's true he has lots of  listeners so what you don't know what these guys want right they're gonna get you on the air see  you know how that guy's speculation howard's obviously doing very well on satellite radio  but curtis lee what knows just because of the deal we made that we actually have more listeners than  howard stern just be the combination of the two of course so to sit there and say we have no list  so we have no listeners on two platforms yeah so why are we still working why don't we just go home i 
[03:36:30]  know yes lots of listeners so what you don't know what these guys want right they're gonna get  you on the air oh my god they want ratings they want people listening to them they're so desperate  i understand they're on the verge of probably being sacked uh you're fired do you know that our  contract extension kicked in literally two weeks ago yeah how we're on the verge  in two weeks it was in the papers jesus christ it was in the papers and i think officially started 
[03:37:00]  around april 24th or something like that we start our extension i don't think i don't know  so it was less than a month ago i don't think they're on the verge of probably being sacked  uh you're fired exactly so you know something uh if you'd like to ladies and gentlemen you can  tell this guy to please stop harassing us here at wabc and please how many calls did he get by the  way steve yeah i was going to mention that uh one missed call one call it could have very well  been from stunt brain over at k rock i haven't checked my messages yeah i would love for our  listeners to continue calling him but his show already ended yeah his show's over it uh it started 
[03:37:30]  at 10 15 it's officially over now so oh well i guess we'll have to get him tomorrow when he does  his next 45 minute radio show up harassing us here at wabc and please leave curtis lee alone  a steve carlessi give that number again leaving this cell number everywhere yes and demanding  begging beseeching please you got to call up curtis should we get johnny to cut a promo with that

[03:38:30]  with that cell phone number in it might might definitely do that meantime if you think that was bad  that two guys where the prime is past them you know they're in the twilight of their career  yeah you and kobe split you up and you sold your partner out exactly you let them yank your partner  off the air and you fucking groveled with a dick in your mouth and took the spot they gave you they  fucking douche your partner and you crawled for the five to six spot and then the fucking 10 to 10 45 
[03:39:00]  spot like a good boy so you could chat with this humorless old fuddy duddy i'm a newsman yeah  yes yes curtis yeah between your obama news i'm gonna get a little edgy uh yeah ratings 10 million  listeners howard has uh what i know they don't have 10 million listeners i'll just agree with  everything you say curtis right of course curtis well that's right curtis i was there the day you 
[03:39:30]  got shot by the mob curtis just want to remind you that uh we've gone two minutes without mentioning the  fact that the mob tried to kill you and i think in court they uh they acquitted him so you can't  even say that the mob tried to kill him oh really yeah that's why you gotta say they almost got you  allegedly because you're really not supposed to talk about it he only in general general terms  now back to the superdelegates obama leads hillary clinton and superdelegates 
[03:40:00]  why i'm being stalked are you are you really from steve carlessi  yeah you really hated us a lot when we met you backstage a few years back i was banging cocktail  waiters two at a time  oh danny thank you danny uh a bill in uh 
[03:40:30]  bill in jersey writes 10 15 to 10 45 holy  shit nasa has a larger window to launch the space shuttle into space than he has on radio  uh well that's why uh that's because the the boss told him this is the best they could do for him  and my pal curtis wasn't brave enough to leave this fine radio company  so he said okay boss okay boss whatever you need boss 
[03:41:00]  i think i got a real impression for once i think i'm right on bro  that two guys where the prime is past them you know they're in the twilight of their career they  are like scraping the bottom of the barrel to try to get anyone to listen to them opie and dopey  yeah then we got some loony kazooine outside loony kazooine does he i guess he does  curtis i like when you use terms like loony kazooie  how about rooted kabooted which is what you got when fucking imus signed someone is like that

[03:48:00]  Is that the line you're going to be saying all the time?  Oh, fuck yeah.  That guy is a pro.  He didn't miss a beat.  How many times are you really going to look back at that picture and say, oh yeah, I spilled  paint that day?  Yeah, remember when you spilled that paint?  It was yesterday.  The kid was so affected, by the way, that the last video clip is him in the playground trying  to forget the horror show that is Mr. McGregor, and he still has the shirt on with the paint.  With the paint.  McGregor didn't even help him get the paint out of his fucking clothes?  A little scarlet letter.  Yeah. 
[03:48:30]  No, but it looks like-  Yeah, all the kids are walking around with paint on their shirts.  But it looks like it's, like, the next day.  Like, why would you put the fucking shirt back on?  You never want to wear that shirt again. </pre>
