<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' drawn-out introduction, featuring Opie, Anthony Cumia, Jim Norton, and Sam Roberts.  The initial discussion revolved around Sam Roberts' attendance at a WWE "No Way Out" pay-per-view event near Father's Day, contrasting with E-Rock's absence due to a family barbecue.  This led to a vulgar and humorous recounting of E-Rock's contentious barbecue experience, including his wife's disapproval of his wrestling fandom and his surreptitious streaming of the pay-per-view on his phone.  The conversation digressed into Sam Roberts' dating history, focusing on his relationships with Black women, sparking discussion about race and cultural perceptions, punctuated by crude jokes and sexual innuendo.

Next, a caller described cock-blocking a friend, leading to a discussion about male behavior towards attractive women and the perceived ulterior motives in male friendships with women in relationships.  This segment was also characterized by crude and sexually explicit language.  Jim Florentine then shared a childhood experience of molestation, offering a possible explanation for his personality, followed by a brief rap interlude.

The show then heavily focused on the death of Rodney King. The hosts discussed the circumstances surrounding his death, his criminal record, public reaction (including Anthony Cumia's controversial tweets), and the footage of the beating and subsequent riots. They made numerous crude comments and speculated about his fiancée's possible involvement.  Anthony Cumia concluded this section with sexually explicit anecdotes from his childhood, including details about his relationship with his father, his friend Richard (who was openly gay), and a friend named Joey Buttlicker.  A brief mention was made of a "Primetime Sam Roberts" segment featuring an interview with Christian Slater.

The show then discussed Bill Moushey (or Mushi), author of "Game Over, Jerry Sandusky," with Moushey participating via phone.  A heated debate ensued with caller Paul Hargis, who dismissed the Sandusky case as a "witch hunt," leading to significant contention and accusations from the hosts regarding Hargis's dismissive attitude towards the victims.  The conversation shifted to reality TV shows like "Pawn Stars," "Hardcore Pawn," "Storage Wars," and "Final Offer," with the hosts expressing cynicism about their authenticity and making numerous crude and sexually suggestive comments.  A bizarre call from a self-proclaimed Etta James' former manager, filled with inappropriate and sexually explicit jokes about the deceased singer, concluded this section.

Another segment featured a caller, Walt from Texas, who misrepresented himself.  The hosts expressed their dislike for various reality TV shows, turning to true crime programming on Investigation Discovery and MSNBC and commenting on the frequency of rape depictions.  A story about Jenny McCarthy accidentally sending a nude photo to her son's dentist led to a discussion about readily available celebrity nude photos, including graphic descriptions of Sarah Silverman and Michelle Williams' bodies from *Take This Waltz*.  The conversation then turned to a former NYPD officer arrested for killing his dog, followed by a "Cribs"-style segment about Jim Norton's messy apartment.  Finally, the show discussed a woman inseminated by a partially cooked squid, featuring graphic descriptions and reactions to images of squid sperm sacs. Jim Norton promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.


In a segment hosted by Sam Roberts in Opie's absence, the show began by discussing the failings of the interns, particularly one who misidentified a caller. The interns' fear of correcting mistakes after Opie picked up a call was highlighted.  Sam requested an update on Opie's whereabouts, but the interns were hesitant to contact him.  The conversation then moved to Anthony's new dad impression, Sam’s relationship with his mother (who listens to the show despite its offensive content, mostly to meet celebrities through her son), and Sam’s recent absence from a family gathering due to a wrestling event. A CM Punk anecdote involving a wink was shared.  The final part involved a thorough review of intern Kevin's job performance, his decision to stop taking Adderall, and his food order mistakes, with a detailed breakdown of each staff member's responsibilities.

I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies. Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die. 
[00:04:30]  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  My knifes are kind of hard.  Kind of hard.  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, yes. Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard. 
[00:05:00]  I missed him this morning. He wasn't at his post.  He was front and center when I walked in.  Was he?  Yeah.  He stayed at his post, and the others ran.  Rathakhan. Fell asleep to it last night.  I haven't seen that movie since probably on HBO in 1988 or whatever.  Horrifically bad, but it's great.  Is it bad?  Nah, well, you know, in hindsight, when it first came out and I saw it, I thought it was the best movie ever made. 
[00:05:30]  And then you realize, you know, everybody stinks in it.  Uh, hi.  Today is the, uh, Nopi and Anthony show. Get it?  Yeah.  The Nopi and Anthony show.  Apparently, uh, Nopi, under said weather.  So he says.  I think he has a Cialis hard-on that won't go away.  He's been taking it every day.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Just to get hard-ons on the way home.  I didn't even know that.  Wow, that could be it then. 
[00:06:00]  Just to get a rod in the car with me and Kenny.  You have one that lasts a little longer than four hours.  You're supposed to have it checked out.  I do.  So perhaps.  On the subway.  Could you check this out, please?  It's been four hours.  A little pup tenting.  Yeah, so, uh, you know, me, Jimmy Norton.  Of course, uh, the, uh, irrepressible Sam Roberts.  Thank you.  I don't even know what that means.  I didn't either.  And, um, whoever else decides to come across our transom.  That's right.  This, uh, great morning.  Fiercely mediocre Sam Roberts. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  More accurate.  Is here.  It's Sam quantity over quality Roberts.  That's my mind, Paul.  That's right.  Sam, throw it against the wall and see what sticks.  Roberts.  Yeah.  So, um, big weekend, I guess, uh, for everybody.  No?  Yeah.  Well, I saw for you, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  I'm not, don't worry, listeners.  Please do not be alarmed.  We are not going to do a wrestling break.  It was Sam Roberts. 
[00:07:00]  No, it would be a bad idea.  It was Sam Roberts at a wrestling event, but we're not talking about the wrestling event  itself, but I do want to talk about the kind of peripheral stuff of why you were there  on Father's Day.  Oh.  Because it was a big weekend, and what I'm saying is because of Father's Day for everybody.  Oh.  And how did you get such good tickets?  Yeah, that's true.  Where were you?  I was right on the aisle.  I mean, what was the event?  There's no way out.  WWE's no way out pay-per-view.  Did they lock all the doors and chain them?  No.  Like, literally, no way out?  But there was one cage match, so you could see where that would work in. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe they just caged or chained all the doors.  So the audience could not leave.  And that would seem dangerous, because if there was an emergency of fire or anything,  everyone would surely perish.  It was surprisingly very safe for the audience.  Oh, okay.  No way out.  That's kind of a...  All right.  So it's the cage thing.  But, now, you were sitting very close.  You tweeted a picture, of course, braggart, that you had nice seats.  How'd you hook those up?  Well, one of the guys who does commentary named Josh Matthews hooked it up for me. 
[00:08:00]  So I've been hanging out with him a little bit.  Oh, you're using him.  He knows you're using him, right?  I'm not using him.  You're hanging out with the guy who does commentary for wrestling, and he doesn't think you're using him?  We're hanging out.  What have you been doing with him?  We were in Hoboken over the weekend.  Hoboken?  No, not Hoboken.  I thought you were talking about what you toured, you know.  Are you summering with him?  No.  We just exchange a text every now and then.  He's in town.  We're hanging out.  He's like, hey, I'll hook you up for the show.  He says, I need a blowjob.  And you say, well, I want to see the show.  If that were the case, it would have been. 
[00:08:30]  Wrestling's answer to Sandusky.  It would have been worth it.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it was good.  You did have very good seats.  Fifth row aisle.  But you abandoned your dad, who just recently performed your nuptials for your grand wedding.  Yeah, well.  And it's Father's Day, and you weren't even with him.  He lives close by, number one.  Number two, I just.  Does that have to do with anything?  I could see him today if I wanted to.  Today is not Father's Day. 
[00:09:00]  It could be.  Oh, I'm sure when you woke up on Christmas morning and run downstairs to an empty tree,  your dad just said, bah, we could give him presents tomorrow.  Yeah.  No, once you miss the day, it's over, Johnny.  My dad's now one for celebration anyway.  And I got two siblings.  So my brother and sister.  Siblings?  Siblings.  He did say siblings.  He did say.  You fucking eye replacement with an E, motherfucker.  I have.  Reitard.  Siblings.  Hope you D.  All right. 
[00:09:30]  You have your siblings, and they, what, represented you?  They were there.  That's wonderful.  He had a nice day, and he'll be able to have a second nice day when I come over and say  hello and give him a card and everything.  All right.  But here's the big thing.  Mm-hmm.  You just got married.  You're supposed to do, like, with the wife, perhaps her father for Father's Day.  You didn't even make an appearance the first Father's Day after you're married?  Well, how could she hang out with her father when she was coming to No Way Out?  Oh, no.  Yeah!  That's how she felt when she said her vows. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, man.  You dragged poor Jess all the way to that God fucking wrestling thing.  She went to the show and had a great time.  The seats were great.  The show, what a spectacle it was.  I bet.  You know, all the pomp and circumstance and the pageantry.  So not only were you taking her father is thinking, you know, my little girl, he's taking her away.  You literally took her away from a father on Father's Day.  Two weeks later on Father's Day. 
[00:10:30]  He couldn't have been happy.  Just so everybody gets a clear picture of what's to come.  Two weeks later.  Oh, really?  You're like, I'm in charge, motherfucker.  I'm in charge.  My wife.  We're going to wrestling.  My girl now.  And if Father's Day rolls around and we want to go to wrestling, so be it.  We're going to wrestling.  I don't care even if we just hang out at home.  Right.  No, nothing to do.  We're just not coming over.  Maybe we'll watch wrestling DVDs.  Oh, man.  I should have.  I could have went to that last night.  I was at a party with Noam from the Comedy Cellar.  I had people over. 
[00:11:00]  And Keith Robinson was there.  Oh, yeah?  And he was going.  Oh, he was.  Because he had a friend who knows somebody and had an extra ticket.  Is it everybody there just from knowing people?  Yeah, I should have went.  Just go?  You should have.  Have you ever been to a live show?  Well, yes.  I saw Sergeant Slaughter wrestle.  Oh.  When I was a kid, my dad took me.  And I remember I almost spit in his face.  Why?  Because he walked by that close to me.  He was the patriotic guy.  Yeah.  No, but he was fighting Bob Backlund at the time.  I liked Bob Backlund. 
[00:11:30]  I didn't go for that.  The Iron Sheik was always his.  Yeah, Sergeant Slaughter was normally a good guy.  No, but he whipped Bob Backlund.  My God, we're talking about wrestling.  I didn't want this to happen.  Well, you should go to a show now, though, Jim.  Oh, God.  I would go.  I didn't know CM Punk was wrestling.  I'd go to see him because I like him.  Of course he's wrestling.  He's the WWE champion.  No.  But I know he wrestled every match.  He's the champ.  But he's not going to wrestle at a pay-per-view?  Oh, I don't know.  How long have you guys do him every 20 minutes as a pay-per-view?  Yeah.  He just won at 11 o'clock this morning.  The fucking on-the-way-to-the-airport fuel. 
[00:12:00]  It's every fucking week.  They don't get, like, three months between matches to actually train and all that stuff.  CM Punk will have another match tonight.  Whatever.  Oh, he will.  That wasn't televised?  It was on pay-per-view.  Oh, it was?  Oh, it was a pay-per-view event.  Oh, okay.  Did you get on camera?  I think so, yeah.  Really?  I was getting tweets from people.  Oh.  That saw my dumb mug.  See, this is when wrestling was good.  Oh, God.  That's a very old clip here where they just go back and forth putting each other in an arm thing. 
[00:12:30]  And that's Bob Backlund.  Oh, that Backlund?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's wearing the tights.  The old-fashioned tights.  And Charlotte's doing the handshake thing.  Yeah.  Looks like they're in Japan, though.  That's great.  So, you went.  Oh, yeah.  But now, I hear tell somebody.  I love when you say that.  I hear tell.  It's never good for someone after that.  Around the old gossip mill, I hear that somebody wanted to go, just like Sam Roberts, the do-his-own-thing-his-own-man, Sam Roberts, boss of his household, Sam Roberts. 
[00:13:00]  The real man's man.  Man's man.  Someone else wanted to go, but perhaps didn't have that certain confidence and power in his own life that Sam has.  Someone else even had tickets at Will Call.  Oh, no.  And they went unused.  What?  By the way, it's in very bad form to leave tickets at Will Call without calling and canceling them.  Yeah.  I don't know if they were canceled or not, but they were at Will Call. 
[00:13:30]  What kind of dumb would leave tickets?  You know who else had them at Will Call?  Rodney King.  He didn't pick them up either.  No, he wouldn't pick them up.  Very classless move.  So, our own E-Rock.  Yeah.  Could not go to the event for E-Rock.  Why?  Now, why couldn't you go?  Let's hear E-Rock's side, and then let's hear the completely accurate Sam Roberts' side.  E-Rock, what's your excuse?  I had to go to a family barbecue for Father's Day that started after 5 p.m. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  So, you had to go see your dad and everything, right?  Not my dad.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Who has a barbecue after 5 on a Sunday?  I know.  What's that about?  After 5?  When did it go?  Like 8.30?  Uh, 9.  Oh, man.  Just cut a nice chunk out of your Sunday night.  Yeah.  You know what?  You should have seen Mr. Talk.  On Friday, he had said that he had already called his father-in-law and said, listen. 
[00:14:30]  I'm the boss of the household, Alice.  I'm the boss.  I'm not going to be able to make it.  And his father-in-law...  I said I was going to leave early.  And his father-in-law said, why?  And he said, I'm going to a wrestling show.  When I got married, I said two things.  I do, and I'm the boss.  And his father-in-law said, seriously?  And E-Rock said, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be at the wrestling show.  Did he really say seriously?  And then he said, why don't you fuck off?  Oh, maybe he didn't say that. 
[00:15:00]  So, wait.  You were pressured into going to this god-awful 5 p.m. barbecue?  It wasn't awful.  It stunk.  Was it better than the pay-per-view?  Well, once 8 o'clock hit, no.  No, I didn't think so.  7.30 was pre-show, by the way.  What else was going on in that yard, aside from the barbecue?  That was fun.  Certainly no volleyball or anything, because it's dark.  What's going on besides mosquitoes biting everybody?  You had no candles?  Eating, drinking, they were playing football.  Fawking, sawking. 
[00:15:30]  They were playing what?  Family football game in the backyard.  The Kennedys?  Yeah, exactly.  Yuck.  Throw me a pass!  You think it's like meet the parents?  Except they all hate E-Rock instead of them all hating Ben Stiller.  You go around, I'll hand it off to you, E-Rock.  Oh, he fumbles it.  No, they all hand it off to him and then pile on him like a fucking longest yard.  He fucking fumbles it every time because he's got greasy barbecue chicken fingers.  Who got mayo on the football? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, we gotta wash the football again, E-Rock.  So, wow, you didn't go to the wrestling thing.  You had to go on the backyard barbecue.  Yeah.  Football in the backyard?  A big yard?  Yeah.  They have a...  Are they as wealthy as the Nagels?  It's one of those arranged marriages, like a fucking King of Thrones?  If not more so.  Yeah.  Game of Thrones.  Game of Thrones.  King of Thrones.  What am I saying?  I say King of Thrones.  It's like Rodney King on the brain.  That'd be the King of Drains. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, Rodney.  Wow.  Yeah, nice.  They do all right.  They do all right?  You got a pool?  At that house, no.  Where do they live?  At that house?  Hey.  Excuse me.  Jeez, the Nagel.  Where do they have a pool?  Her other family has pools.  At this particular house, they didn't have a pool.  Other family?  What's going on there?  The Nagel house.  Where does she live?  Jersey?  Yeah.  You know what they didn't have?  A wrestling ring with a steel cage. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, shit.  Did you want to go to the wrestling match?  No escape from the barbecue.  Yeah, I did want to go.  Whatever the fuck it's called.  And then I got talked to because I was streaming the pay-per-view on my phone instead of interacting  with the family.  When did you find out you weren't going to get to go to the show?  About 4.30.  That late?  Yeah.  Whose edict was it?  Oh, man.  So I sent a message saying I can't use the tickets.  Oh, you did? 
[00:17:30]  Give them to somebody else.  Wait, how did it come at 4.30?  What happened?  I thought I was going to be able to still leave after a couple hours and head over to the  arena, and that wasn't so.  What happened?  What happened?  There was a loud discussion as far as this was going to happen or not.  Oh, was there a little tiff at the Nagel residence about this?  It caused a few problems.  Did you get yelled at?  Sure, if you want to call it that. 
[00:18:00]  You were told you were going to the barbecue and you were not going to some stupid fucking  wrestling thing.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, no.  Wow.  You're like 31 years old.  Oh.  And did you see Sam Roberts when you were streaming it on your phone?  I saw.  Having all fun with his wife and stuff?  I saw.  Jess had a blast.  Jess was having fun.  Why didn't you go with your wife?  She refuses to go to those things.  Oh, no.  Trouble in paradise.  I've asked, but she just will never go to those things. 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  She hates it.  Wow.  And Eric is putting on the New Jersey Devil's jerseys to show support for her.  Right, because she was never any hockey fan before.  You guys got to compromise.  That's her way of getting back at you.  She's so sick of him lollygagging around the house and just lumping it up in the living room.  What is it, dumb action figures and everything?  Yeah, and his stupid sneakers eating fucking lime chips, whatever.  What's that?  She's had enough.  Wow.  Who told you you can't go? 
[00:19:00]  Like, who gave you the order?  Well, when you're told, fine, go ahead, you're allowed to go.  Oh, that sounds good.  When my wife says that, it means you can go, right?  Yeah.  But when your car is blocked in on the driveway and she refuses to move her car.  Oh, my God.  And then starts yelling.  What did she say?  Was she yelling in front of her family?  No, this was still at home.  This was before we even left for the barbecue.  What did she say?  She wasn't happy. 
[00:19:30]  I don't really want to go into it.  She just was not having any of this.  Well, what did she say to you?  It's not private.  Don't talk about the whole marriage.  Talk about just that.  It's not a private situation.  Well, when it gets turned into, why do you hate me?  Oh!  And then I'm like, oh, damn.  Why does she think you hate her?  Did you step on her foot?  I'm sorry.  See, wives got to understand something like that, though.  It's not, you don't hate them.  You just want to do something aside from what she wants to do. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  You just love wrestling more.  Right.  Yeah, that's what I was accused of.  You love scantily clad, muscular men more than your own wife, and that's fine.  And then at the barbecue, while I'm watching the pay-per-view, and then she found out I  had the pay-per-view on my phone.  Oh, boy.  She started screaming, can't you get off your fucking phone for five minutes?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Was she drunk?  No, she was not.  She was not.  She was...  How long have you been married?  Just over a year and a half. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, great.  Oh, my God.  Cool.  Only 50 years to go.  But you don't think Y-Rock compromises a lot and does her stuff, though?  Yes, of course he does her stuff.  He did her stuff yesterday.  Oh, he did.  What was yesterday?  The barbecue.  It was her family.  But, I mean, is that why she's annoyed that you never compromise?  No, she thinks I get antisocial a lot, so that's her biggest problem.  Well, then why does she drag you to places you don't want to be?  See, I wanted to say that, and I didn't, but... 
[00:21:00]  I mean, you do get antisocial.  I don't...  I didn't have a problem being at her family.  I love her family and everything.  Yeah, but you didn't play going to some dumb barbecue at 5 o'clock to go to that pay-per-view.  You like the McMahons more than her family.  Yeah.  That's fine.  That's fair.  Imagine Father's Day at the McMahons.  I like the McMahons more than my family.  They understand.  Oh, you're terrible.  Did your wife have fun?  Yeah, she had a lot of fun.  That's the way you do it.  Did you see the families in the afternoon?  No, we call my dad, and we'll see them during the week, though. 
[00:21:30]  We saw them last week.  You know, we live close to the family, so we see them every couple weeks.  How often does she see her family?  Not at all?  More often than I see my family, but not that often.  And she starts screaming at you to get off your fucking phone?  Wow.  And you did, didn't you, Buster?  Oh, man.  Did he hit that off button quick?  Buster got right off his phone.  Oh, yeah.  No, the pay-per-view stayed on for a while longer, but she wasn't talking to me.  You are, I think, Iraq's a bit what they call pussy whipped. 
[00:22:00]  I think so, too.  Pussy whipped, right?  A little henpecked.  He loves that on his ice cream.  Pussy whipped.  Oh, he doesn't like ice cream.  Forgot about that.  Cake.  New sweet sandwiches.  Yeah, sandwiches.  Yeah, well, that's a little pussy whipped, though.  Yeah.  You should be like, hey, I'm going.  This is a one-time event this week.  Exactly, yeah.  No way out comes but once a year.  Yes.  Oh, I would hate that.  Oh, Iraq, that's a sad story.  At what time did you leave the barbecue? 
[00:22:30]  9.30.  Oh, it's too late for a barbecue.  I kept saying, I was like, we really need to leave, and we were the last ones to leave.  Oh, well, you're just punishing him all mad.  She was punishing him.  Yeah.  Dude, I've been in that situation where all I want to do is leave, and I'm walking around,  and she's still fucking jabber-jawing, yip, yip, yip, yip, and I'm just like, fuck, let's  go.  I want to leave without saying goodbye or anything.  Just jump in the fucking car and go.  Well, I'll say goodbye, but it's just like around 9.30, I should be watching TV in bed 
[00:23:00]  already or trying to go to sleep, not, hey, I got a 40-minute drive home.  Wait, Iraq, if you were at the pay-per-view, you would have left early to go home and go  to bed by 9.30?  No, that I would have found through.  Yeah.  That was done at 11.  That's a special event.  11, huh?  Yeah.  Did you watch it at home, or was that...  I missed every...  Well, I got what I saw on my phone at that point, but the middle to the end of it, I  lost, which is the really good part of it.  Now, why, when you got home, could you not have watched it?  Because I didn't order it through my cable. 
[00:23:30]  But why didn't you watch the rest on your phone?  He's punished.  I was driving.  So why didn't you put it on and listen to it?  It would take an hour and a half to get home?  It took like 40 minutes to get home.  Could she drive?  Why didn't you listen to the...  Watch the end of it on your phone?  You knew she would fucking unload on you.  Yeah, he's scared.  If you were even home watching it on...  She had beat you down so badly by that point, you couldn't even watch it in your own house?  But can't you just be like nice at her things and not be on your phone, and then she will  be nice for your things?  Um, well, she puts up with a lot. 
[00:24:00]  Like what?  A lot of my nonsense, so...  She didn't let you go to the pay-per-view.  When it comes to family stuff, I really can't.  Your tickets!  She's probably...  Her thinking is this one thing.  Yeah.  Have you seen her, and have you seen him?  She probably said that to him finally.  Have you looked at me and then looked at you?  How about you do one thing for me?  One thing.  The pay-per-view.  That's all I'm asking.  You don't think you should have compromised?  Absolutely not.  He should have been at the pay-per-view.  He had tickets.  Do you think that this is the beginning of a fucking downward spiral? 
[00:24:30]  Absolutely.  Into not doing what he wants?  Forget about it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  This is the third act of a downward spiral.  Yeah.  This is definitely not the beginning.  You're going to start building up resentments.  Resentment in marriage is the death knell, man.  That is fucking bad.  Eventually, she'll be like, no, Monday night is dance night.  You can't watch Raw.  Yeah.  I resented my wife for not allowing me to have sex with other women unless she was in the room. 
[00:25:00]  The resentment just chipped away and really ruined the marriage.  Yeah.  Well, she has probably resentment against him, though.  He doesn't resent her.  She's probably just tired of him sitting around eating fucking, like, meat ice cream floats or whatever it is he enjoys on a fucking Friday night just doing childish things.  Yeah.  Steak martinis.  What was the last thing she made you do that you really didn't want to do?  Barbecue.  Go to the gym.  That's true.  She did get in the personal trainer. 
[00:25:30]  Close the fridge.  Sorry.  An event, a family thing, something where you were just like, I don't want to be here, but I'm here because she said.  Gardening.  Whoa.  Hold the phone.  You're gardening?  We're redoing the whole back and side of the property.  And what does that entail?  Oh, man.  Pulling out what was already there, tilling all the earth, replanting.  You're tilling the earth?  Tilling earth.  Like paw angles. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, shit.  We got these tools.  We put it in like a corkscrew to rip up the ground so it turns it all off.  Why do you hire someone to do that?  Well, she does that.  The Nagels have some money.  What are you doing?  Yeah, I mow the lawn, too.  Yeah, you got it, though.  Gardening.  Yeah.  Gardening?  And what are you, pulling weeds and shit?  Well, yeah, I started that and then I said, fuck that.  I hired somebody that comes in and sprays and pulls all the weeds out.  Oh, man.  Because I started ripping plants out not knowing what was a weed and what was a plant. 
[00:26:30]  It just looks like a weed.  Anything green was just getting yanked out of there.  Would you laugh if you disturbed a hornet nest?  That would be great.  And it got even more bloated because of all the stings.  Oh, that's unnecessary.  Something about that seed, huh?  She made you do this.  She made you do this and you didn't want to.  Well, it had to be done before we could do other things.  Like what?  In the backyard.  Oh.  Other designs and what we're doing.  Oh, big plans.  Very work and fencing and big plans for the South 40. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should, because she's a big New Jersey Devils fan.  Huge.  Really?  Next season, you should be like, no, you can't go to the Devils games because you've been ignoring me  and I want a dinner at home with you.  Ah, what do you think would happen there, Iraq?  She'd laugh.  Oh, Jesus.  She'd call her friend and said, all right, I got tickets.  I'm going.  Uh-oh, guy friend?  No, no, no.  Oh.  Then how can you possibly let her tell you you can't go to a wrestling show?  Of course you would.  Because it's not interfering with a family event. 
[00:27:30]  Then schedule a family event on a Devils game.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to get her back for this or else you're not a man.  You know how quick?  I would schedule family events every Devils game.  Every home game.  Yep.  Every one.  Not a bad idea.  Yeah.  And she would still, she would ditch him to go to the Devils game.  He'd be at some family event he doesn't want to be at either.  You should have went.  You should have gone.  So me and you could have talked about it today. 
[00:28:00]  God damn it.  Great.  Both of you is on pay-per-view.  Just big shit-eating grins on your face.  Yeah, laughing.  I didn't know you had those extra tickets there.  Great.  Well, they were just sitting at Wilco.  You could have told them you were Eric Nagel.  Nah, you need ID.  Man.  I don't know who to call for wrestling tickets.  I can get you wrestling tickets.  Oh, he'll get you.  He can get anybody.  Even E-Rock.  E-Rock.  They'll always have leftovers from the ones E-Rock's not using.  Just step up to the window and say, uh, Eric Nagel.  And they'll be like, oh, yeah, here they are.  Yeah.  Here's two.  Front and center.  Are they front row tickets he passed up?  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't think it's tickets.  They're sort of like what you get at UFC. 
[00:28:30]  They're the one level above, so you're even with the ring.  I get the floor now.  I've only had that a couple times.  Oh, he's talking those tickets.  I'm like, yeah, they're really good.  And, uh, I was at a barbecue.  Gas or Kohl's?  That would be gas.  Not even Kohl's.  No.  Damn it.  What'd you eat at the barbecue?  It tastes better.  Everything.  He ate his sorrows away.  All his frustrations.  Oh, yeah.  Were you just chewing your frustrations?  Everything he wanted to say to his wife, he said to his steak.  Yeah.  Fuck, I wanted to go to that. 
[00:29:00]  I'm going to eat like the big show then.  Where were you hiding to watch it on your phone?  I was out in the open.  I was sitting outside in the back where all the tables and chairs were.  I was just sitting there with the phone right on the table.  And how long before she came up?  How much did you get to see before she came up and said, what the fuck are you doing?  The first time, I was watching for about ten minutes.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  But she scolded you again?  She scolded you.  After that, she was walking around, talking to the family and everything. 
[00:29:30]  And then she was like, where's Eric?  Oh, no.  I looked outside.  I'm still out there watching on my phone.  And then she came out again.  She feels like his mom.  Oh, God, yeah.  She does.  You know what I mean?  Like, I shouldn't have to tell him this.  Yeah.  Like, she's more pissed that she has to tell you than that you're doing it.  That pisses women off even more.  You think she's embarrassed by her husband?  Yes.  That he's just sitting out there in front of her.  I swear she is, yeah.  And it's her family.  And they're like, this is the guy.  Like, this is the guy. 
[00:30:00]  He's not watching wrestling on TV.  No, not even on TV.  On his cell phone.  On his telephone.  Oh, wow.  He's streaming wrestling pay-per-views on his phone.  How much did it cost you on the phone?  It didn't.  He did it illegally.  Oh.  He is a rebel.  Why can't you support WWE a little bit?  Why'd you steal it?  If I was at home, I would have paid for it.  No, you wouldn't have.  No, she wouldn't have allowed that either.  She wouldn't have.  Oh, man.  You're not putting that shit on my TV.  Watch it on your computer.  Do you watch a lot of wrestling at home? 
[00:30:30]  When he's allowed?  Twice a week, three times with pay-per-view.  Oh, my God.  And she doesn't like it?  So what does she do?  When you're watching these?  She watches other shit.  Where?  In another room?  In another room.  So you two are in separate rooms.  You're watching wrestling.  She's watching something else.  And you do this three times a week.  Monday night, Friday night, and then Friday night.  Friday night is spent watching wrestling while your wife's in another room.  Well, usually it's DVR, so I'll watch it at some point.  So after a great match, you just want to talk about it with somebody? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, man.  And you go in the room, and she just doesn't want to hear it.  She has no fucking excitement or interest.  And you're just like, oh, you know what just happened?  I know you're not into this, but let me tell you.  And you're just trying to bounce it off of somebody.  Phil the Masher pinned Billy Lips.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Lost his hat.  Yeah.  Oh, it was great.  You know, as much as she doesn't like wrestling, Jess knows every character, every finishing  movie, every storyline.  Does she not love wrestling? 
[00:31:30]  She doesn't like wrestling.  She doesn't like wrestling, but she loves Sam Roberts.  That's right.  That's the difference.  And we compromise for each other.  How do you compromise for her?  Well, if there are family events for her, I will not be on my phone the whole time.  I'll be active with her family.  No matter what's on, maybe even wrestling?  Wrestling wouldn't be on, because I'd be like, we're going to the pay-per-view, babe.  You got that right.  Okay.  All right.  Or if she wanted to, we let her choose the movie.  If she wants to go see a chick flick or something, I'm all for it. 
[00:32:00]  Okay.  I don't pout when we do her things.  And so, she does my things.  Iraq, what happens if, let's say, Friday night rolls around.  You come home.  You're all set for some wrestling.  And candles are lit around the house.  You walk in, and she's in some nighty type thing, and candles are lit.  And she wants to have a romantic Friday night. 
[00:32:30]  I grab a beer and sit down and play EverQuest.  Oh.  Well, that's exactly what I did.  Boy, they don't like that at all.  No?  When it's a romantic night.  Would you pretend you didn't notice the candles being lit?  Yes, I did.  Ah, it's the worst.  I'd talk about how my day was just like, oh, God.  Like, try to diffuse the whole thing.  It's so hard as a man when you want to avoid fucking, because chicks don't know how to...  We're so used to their signals when they want to avoid giving up some puss.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:33:00]  But they don't know how to handle when a guy doesn't want to fuck them.  Yeah.  And if that's the case, boy, there's a problem in the relationship.  So wait, you would pretend you didn't see the candles and just talk about your day?  Yeah.  I would walk in and be like, oh, God.  Like, if I was angry or frustrated about my day, that, you know, how am I supposed to,  you know, be all romantic?  And I'd just make myself a Captain of Coke really quickly, very strong, and drink myself  into the ability to fuck her.  Oh, no.  It was horrible. 
[00:33:30]  It is the worst when you know they want dick.  Oh, I did not want to be with her.  I don't think this is all E-Rock's wife's fault, though.  Of course it's not.  It's because E-Rock doesn't compromise and do things for her, and he buys, like, Millennium  Falcon Legos instead of, like, hanging out with her.  You know what?  She does put up with that.  Then she's like, whoa.  She bought it from me.  She's hoping you'd swallow a piece.  How far along are you with that, by the way?  Oh, yeah.  The pieces are laid out.  I haven't started it yet.  Oh, no. 
[00:34:00]  What the fuck?  Why'd you hang out with her?  They're on a table in the basement right now.  Why?  So you've got to go down into the basement when you're doing this?  That's probably keeping you from doing it.  Yeah.  No real windows and sunlight.  Is there a TV down there?  Yeah, there's a TV down there.  Oh, man.  Yeah, the steps.  He's trying to have an elevator put in.  Go to the basement.  He's got one of those wheelchairs on the side.  It's like, what's her name in the Sopranos?  Yeah, the mother.  Oh, E-Rock.  So when are you going to have time to do that between wrestling and paying any attention 
[00:34:30]  to your wife?  Hopefully soon.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you guys have a lot of sex?  You have to go in there, like, how many times a week?  We do all right.  Every week?  Yeah, every week.  It's not as much as when you first got together.  That never happens right again.  No, that was over six years ago.  Oh, wow.  You get along better when you fuck it, man.  You really do.  Yeah, you really do.  It's weird.  I know you can't keep that forever.  It's very difficult once it drops off. 
[00:35:00]  It's like you're not going to fuck when you're a year in a relationship like you did the first  week.  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got to average it out, though, somewhere.  Once you stop having sex and then you start thinking, like, wow, when was the last time?  Oh, boy.  It is over.  Or time to bail.  That's a big part of it.  And it's not just the sex thing.  That's kind of an indicator of other shit.  Right.  It's not just, oh, we're just not having sex, but everything else is hunky-dory.  We have to physically like seeing each other. 
[00:35:30]  There you go.  You know what I mean?  That's it.  Just like not be...  Because if you're not having sex, you're probably disgusted by each other.  Yeah, you just don't want to fucking see each other or hang around with each other,  be alone with each other.  There's always got to be some kind of distraction.  That's death.  Oh, that is the worst.  Yeah.  Oh, there have been times I would, you know, jump into bed and the first thing I would do  is grab that remote, try to find something on.  Or you immediately go and lay on your side.  Oh, lay on the side, grab the remote, put a movie on I've seen 80 times.  It's not even like it's something new and cool.  Yeah.  This is a good part.  Or give her a kiss that she can't interpret as sexual. 
[00:36:00]  Like I used to do that too if I didn't want to fuck.  Yeah, like a little pick on a kiss on the fucking, uh, the upper chub of the fucking cheek.  Mwah.  And make it noise.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Love you.  And then lay down on the other side.  You lay down on the other side.  Oh, my back.  Mwah.  Maybe take your arm and fling it over behind you just so it's laying on the quilt on her  leg or something maybe.  And that moves within two seconds.  I am exhausted.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, boy.  Ugh.  Yeah, well, we haven't had any sex lately or anything.  Yeah, it's tired.  It's tired, right?  I'm tired.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that happens, uh, you know, in a new relationship.  Oh, yeah, just tired.  Yeah.  Just tired.  That's why we didn't fuck eight times.  How do you like being married so far?  So far, I like it a lot.  No problems, right?  Same thing?  Is it the exact same thing as not being married?  It's a little more of a partnership.  What do you mean by that?  We just feel more like partners.  What, like the Smith brothers? 
[00:37:00]  Yes.  We're going into business together.  We're going into business.  No, just like, you know, it's like a team.  Weren't you a team before?  You didn't have that same feeling?  Yeah, but now it's like we're definitely like a team.  Now you're legally bound.  A team, a legally for life.  Contractual obligation.  There's lawyers to be seen if we don't want to be a team anymore.  Oh, shit.  Type of team.  It hangs over your head, doesn't it, a little bit, as a married guy.  It's not like daunting or anything.  It's just like, yeah, we're in this thing.  Here's the thing about Sam.  Sam knows he's going to be somebody in this business. 
[00:37:30]  And he's got very...  He's the only one who knows that.  Nobody else sees it.  No one else thinks it.  I know.  I'm all I need.  He's got big ideas, is what they're called.  And he sees his future laid out in this entertainment radio business, and he sees himself doing very well in it.  So he gets a little frightened.  Now, I've spoken about my marriage and how I got married when I was knocking tin in construction.  I had nary a worry in the world about my wife jacking me for millions when a divorce came around. 
[00:38:00]  I didn't know that I would fall into this great gig, and it cost me dearly.  So getting married for you, knowing in your own head that you're going to be somebody, is my own reality.  Probably a little scary.  But at the same time, I think...  No prenup, right?  No prenup.  Oh!  But I think it's a valuable thing to have a partner that gets what you're doing. 
[00:38:30]  This is all going to be used as testimony in court.  Yeah, yeah.  He actually stated, and I believe it was June of 2012, that he was indeed in a partnership.  And that it was helpful to his career.  Oh, man.  Well, I just think it's good to have a partner that gets what you're doing.  Oh, he's hanging himself right about now.  Yeah.  Who has your back.  Uh-huh.  And who's down.  And who's a part of the process, the creative process.  Oh, geez.  Does she ever inspire you as far as on-air material goes? 
[00:39:00]  On-air material, no.  Never.  Never once.  There he goes.  And he's off.  Never once.  An element of doubt right there in his head.  There's enough Jess stories on the air that I wouldn't have to say it.  Like, it's just...  Oh, they would just play tapes.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It's just there.  Yeah.  But I'm not worried about it.  And I also think it looks more like...  You look more like a substantial guy if they're like, okay, he's a man to be taken seriously.  He's a married man.  Oh, there you go.  You know.  What is this?  1955?  A man to be taken...  Yeah, exactly.  What are you trying to get the fucking Don to finance your drug operation? 
[00:39:30]  Stupid asshole.  He's a man to be taken seriously.  I heard you were a man who likes wrestling.  It was to be taken seriously.  What's it going to be, Pop?  Are you going to listen to a Saturday show or what?  Yeah, I don't see Sam getting divorced anytime soon.  He's not a pig on the road.  He's actually a normal dude.  It's really annoying.  No, I think he realizes he's in way out of his league.  Yes.  And I think they're genuinely in love with each other. 
[00:40:00]  And I don't know.  And I can see you.  You're going to have a family?  You're going to have some kids?  At some point, yes.  Yeah.  I mean...  Don't fuck that body up yet.  Yeah, no.  Not Jess.  Yours.  Thank you.  No, I appreciate it.  Gorgeous.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, financially, there's no money for kids yet.  You know what?  There's some people that don't even think that.  They have 10, 12.  Don't care about finances.  I don't know.  I've just seen them.  Just some people.  Yeah, I've just seen them.  I don't know.  Online.  Websites. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, no, no, no.  In the future, yes.  Yeah, it just costs a little too much, right?  Yes.  Yeah, I hear you.  I'm very fond of Jess.  And for whatever reason, she's fond of Jess.  She's very fond of me, too.  How long were you courting?  Very fond of each other.  We did have a courting process.  Was it courting?  I felt that way.  Were you traditional?  We had to put the bag on.  That was courting.  No, that was right before the wedding.  That wasn't courting.  She had been courted by that point.  I heard you dodging the question about having sex without a condom.  You said that's... 
[00:41:00]  Jess complimented me.  She was listening, and she complimented me on how well I was able to duck and weave out  of it.  Uh-huh.  Things are as they should be now.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's enough said right there.  As they should be.  So you took the bag off.  Yeah.  Finally.  Fucking as a man.  Were you...  Were you...  Now, I know you both have a good sense of humor.  Were you chuckling in the sack, thinking, hey, I'm about to, you know...  We were both aware of what was about to happen.  Yes.  Yeah, bareback. 
[00:41:30]  Did you last not as long or no?  Oh, my God.  She finds out he shoots in two seconds without a bag.  Oh, how embarrassing would that be?  I was better than I thought I would be.  Oh.  In terms of time spent.  Was he on there cheering me on?  T.S.F.  Yeah.  T.S.T.S.F.  Yeah, no.  It was minutes, not seconds.  Oh, well, that's good.  So that's something to be said.  Minute, not seconds.  Do you think you're a good bang?  No.  Oh. 
[00:42:00]  Not particularly.  No?  I think it's a pretty basic operation with old Sam.  Really?  That's funny.  Just hop aboard.  Yeah.  But, you know, the job gets done.  Do you get mad?  Do you go down?  Okay.  You do, right?  Yes.  Do you like doing that?  Yes.  All right, good.  Oh.  That's why those black chicks you dated before, Jess, must have loved you.  They'd never had anybody do that.  What is this?  What is this he's doing?  This is craziness.  Look out there, pussy.  Do you see a big light bulb in his face?  Big white glowing pleasure center. 
[00:42:30]  It was.  They'd just be like, what the fuck is this?  You're doing what with your...  What?  Why are you licking that down there?  That's craziness.  Yeah.  Poor Sam.  Jess didn't have any problem with knowing that your whole, like, background has just been  interracial relationships up until her.  In the beginning, she did.  That was a point.  Not like a problem, but there was definitely a point of, like...  She's a racist.  A little jealousy.  No, she wasn't a racist.  Oh, jealousy.  Oh, that's different than racism.  But she did, like, when we were first, like, for the first year or so, she would randomly 
[00:43:00]  say, Sam, tell me.  Drop N-bombs.  Are you sad that I'm not black?  These should be the questions.  What is that kind of question?  And I'd be like, what?  No.  And then she'd say, because I'm sad that you're not.  Are you sad that I'm not black?  I'd have questions like that, or she wouldn't like if I was looking at black girls when they 
[00:43:30]  were walked by or whatever.  Wow.  What kind of black girls did you like?  I mean, black girl, black girl.  No, but I mean, did you like with a weave or fake hair or, like, a white-looking black  girl, or did you like a girl with, like, really short hair who looked very Nubian?  Um, I preferred...  I dated a girl who used to wear weaves and stuff, but I preferred without girls with natural  hair.  Well, what was the...  Oh, there was the weave girl.  It was a weird girl, right?  No, she wasn't...  Well, she wasn't as weird.  There were several weird black girls. 
[00:44:00]  Black girls are weird.  Did you have...  Yeah, they're crazy.  Did you get, uh...  Did you catch shit being interracial like that, walking down the streets?  Did you ever see any of this prejudice or resentment?  No?  I never saw any prejudice.  No?  You know, I got goofed out.  Black guys ever, like, looking at you and go, yeah, I fucking peck a wood with that chick.  No, it was more like, you know...  Yeah, man!  Oh, my nigga.  If hookah was here, I would say the word.  Right, right.  Yeah, he was sure spouting it off the other day, wasn't he?  Calling the interns niggas. 
[00:44:30]  So, you would, uh, they would, they would kind of like it and goof on it.  Yeah, more respect in the community.  I don't think it was respect.  I think they were laughing at you.  That could be, too, but it's better than getting beaten up.  You know...  Were you ready?  Did you try to be tough in those situations?  Never.  No, I would just try to laugh with them.  Yeah, do that.  Smile, laugh.  Tap dance, step and fetch it, whatever you gotta do.  Just allow me to pass.  Yeah, yeah.  And was the chick uncomfortable, knowing that, you know, from the community?  Of course she was.  Yeah.  She's used to dating, like, guys who fucking throw down and fight and thugs. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Why did they go out with you?  I don't know.  And was there ever any discussion between you and your black girlfriends about race?  Did you have racial discussions at home?  Yeah, and with their families and stuff.  Oh, really?  It was a very different perspective.  And how did that, how was that?  Like, obviously, you're white guys, so you walk, well, kind of, not obviously.  I don't know.  They included him as one of them.  Yeah.  They thought he was just, like, an albino black guy.  Well, my one ex-girlfriend's mom told me I was racially ambiguous, and that was very 
[00:45:30]  in style, so I was very lucky right now.  Oh, oh, okay.  So that made me feel better.  Yeah.  But, no.  Like the Seinfeld episode.  A lot of, yeah.  A lot of conversations about racial bias in the media.  Oh, really?  The way black people are portrayed.  You are inside.  Absolutely.  Able to see them in their own habitat as far as talking amongst each other like a fly on the  wall kind of a thing.  I did get to see many conversations that many white people are privy to.  I will not say in their own habitat because... 
[00:46:00]  I just meant in their house, you know what I mean?  Sure.  I didn't mean it like that.  But it is kind of, you know, it's like you're viewing something that not many people are privy  to.  It was very interesting.  Yeah.  And is there a lot of, like, motherfucking white people?  No.  Oh, it was fucking white.  Just all the time.  A little more educated than that.  Did they notice, I bet you that they didn't talk a lot about how race is only mentioned  one way.  They probably saw just the opposite, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, they didn't see.  They saw...  Black people being criminalized.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Whoa, really?  Uh-huh.  And they saw, you know, the sort of buffoonery that is portrayed as black people in film  and TV and stuff like that.  That's kind of true.  Oh, yeah?  In some cases, yeah.  They were...  Malcolm X?  Oh, that's right.  That wasn't buffoonery.  Well, not Malcolm X.  Starring role.  They were far more offended by the buffoonery than the criminalization.  Wow.  Yeah.  What's, like, when they try to find someone to interview, they always go with the fucking...  Yeah, exactly.  The worst one.  They do that with white people, too, when they can, though. 
[00:47:00]  Like, when they find somebody, you know, who's like, I really think that I sold the car,  like, they'll go with the fucking dumbest motherfucker they can find.  It's more entertaining.  Yeah, that's what they're looking for.  But even, like, even black movies that are...  Even by black people, like, they've found very offensive.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Um, really?  Yeah.  Do they think it plays into stereotypes?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yep.  Like Tyler Perry stuff?  Uh, yeah.  That's some buffoonery right there.  I wasn't dating her when that movie came out.  What did they consider buffoonery? 
[00:47:30]  Like, what did black people consider buffoonery in black movies?  Well, like Soul Plane, for instance.  Like, a movie like that.  Oh, yeah, of course.  I was so happy.  First thing you pull out is a Kevin Hart movie.  I was thinking that.  I was like, wow, whatever.  Didn't Louie write that, too?  No, no.  He wrote Pootie Tang.  Pootie Tang.  That's right.  Um, yeah.  Movies like, uh, How High, with Method Man and Red Man in it.  How about Friday's?  Friday, yeah.  All those types of movies.  But those are just romps, like Porky's.  Right. 
[00:48:00]  Those are just dumb.  But, like, I think their problem was Porky's people didn't see as, like, these are white people  representing white people.  And a lot of people look at those movies, and it shapes the image of black people in  their minds.  Oh, man.  Oh, okay.  Look at you.  I'm telling you.  This is what you were hearing in there?  I had a lot of experience.  They felt, because Sam Pryde tried to pipe up one to the Porky's example.  Oh, yeah.  What about Fast Times at Ridgemont High?  Uh-huh.  Yo, nobody is saying that defines white people.  Motherfucker.  That's how you knew that their families were really radical, because when they didn't say 
[00:48:30]  white people, they would go, that doesn't define white people.  White.  There's always that pause before the word white.  White.  White.  You don't understand because you're a white person.  Check out the big brain on Sam.  You're a smart motherfucker.  No, I wouldn't really argue.  I would just kind of listen.  Yeah.  That was very interesting in their perspective, because it was completely foreign to me.  You were like a fly on the distended belly.  What? 
[00:49:00]  That would have said wall.  Fly on the wall.  That's all right.  That's a pretty cool fucking take you have on the whole thing.  Yeah.  So, when you met Jess, were you, I mean, obviously a very pretty girl and everything, but were  you thinking, eh, she's not black?  I thought it was interesting that I was into her and she wasn't black, but it wasn't  like, you were exclusively black.  I dated one Chinese girl in the mix there.  Chinese girl?  Yeah.  How'd you go there?  That was awful.  Do you and your black friend walk into a liquor store? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Swatzing behind the counter?  Wow.  She's gorgeous.  So, wait.  How long did you pursue Jess before you got her?  A couple months.  Oh, okay.  I saw that.  Yeah.  You know, but we were hanging out like, it was over the course of a summer, it was very  much like Greece.  Yeah, hopefully it'll work out that way 20 years from now, with your fucking trying to  jerk massage therapist off in your face.  So, she was hanging out with you.  Did you like, indicate that you liked her and she didn't at first? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  I mean, she said, you know, she just wanted to be friends.  And I was like, yeah, whatever.  But I was hanging out with her all the time and I was cock blocking other guys around  her and all kinds of stuff.  You got the plan laid out.  Yeah, yeah.  She was into a guy.  I was just cock blocking him left and right.  Oh, man.  How were you cock blocking him?  Well, I was like, making him think I was like, cool.  Like, I liked him.  And so, when he was hanging out with her, he'd be like, yeah, we should invite Sam.  And then I would just make sure nothing happened.  Like, I wouldn't let them have any alone time.  Oh, what a dope he was.  Yeah, he was so stupid. 
[00:50:30]  Like, and then eventually I made it so I told Jess, even though we weren't, like, dating  or anything, I was like, you know, I'm just ruining your alone time with him.  And then we had pulled a reversal.  So, like, we were having jokes on him behind his back.  He should have been motherfucking you to her.  Absolutely.  He should have been fucking like, you're this guy.  Wait, what kind of jokes behind his back?  Oh, no.  Just about how stupid he was.  Because I told her, like, while it was happening, I was like, you know, I'm not letting you have  any alone time with him, right?  Like, you know I'm doing that. 
[00:51:00]  Did she ever sleep with him?  No.  I don't believe that.  I'll bet you she did once when you weren't around.  She didn't.  She would have told me.  Look at that.  Sam took the nice guy best friend approach.  Yeah.  And cockblocked.  That is, that's why, guys, if you've got a girlfriend that has one of these fucking  dumbass friends like Sam, just nip it in the butt or tell her to go fucking take a hike.  That's right.  Because she will fuck him.  She will end up fucking him.  Period.  Any guy that she's at all friends with.  I watch like a hawk.  Yeah, huh?  They all want to fuck her.  Because they're all trying to bang her. 
[00:51:30]  Yes!  All the time.  Even if they know they can't and they're not going to actively hit on her.  They're waiting for the signal.  Waiting for that weak moment.  At best, they're waiting for her to make a move.  Yep.  You know that.  Very rarely is there not an ulterior motive.  And just waiting for you to fuck up somewhere along the line where she needs, you know, some  kind of a shoulder.  Something like that.  Guys are pigs and dogs.  And I hate when women pretend they don't see it.  Like, they'll be like, no, he just, because they have to deal with it all the time. 
[00:52:00]  Like, we're known guys want to fuck them, but they always know.  And she knows that every guy she hangs out with at work or whatever, who is beyond just  a co-worker, is attracted to her.  On some level.  Yeah.  Yes.  And if you drop dead, they would have sex with her in front of your coffin.  She wouldn't go somewhere without you with some guy friend?  You wouldn't allow that, right?  Like, what do you mean go somewhere?  To dinner on a Friday.  No, absolutely not.  Or a movie she wants to see, a concert, something. 
[00:52:30]  Nope.  How about lunch?  Very good.  At work?  Well, I mean, I can't do much about that.  Oh, yes, you can.  Lay the law down.  That's right.  I mean, I can't not allow her to, because then she'll just do it behind my back.  That's like, you know, I gotta, you know, not be jealous.  You know what?  Be a little jealous.  Holy fuck.  I'm sorry.  I can't help it.  The relationship talk.  That's all my barbecue coming out from yesterday.  Lovely barbecued stuff.  So wait, if she wanted to hang out with a male co-worker or a male friend, you would  say, not without me there. 
[00:53:00]  You wouldn't, you know.  I'd just be like, yeah, why don't we both hang out?  You know what's discussed during lunch, though?  Like that?  Yeah, I know.  The company, they talk, they have something in common, the workplace.  And then, you know, it turns into fucking, hey, you like your pussy being eaten?  And she goes, do you like wrestling?  He's like, no, it's for queers.  Yeah, and they went over there, right?  All right.  You want to take a break and then eat?  Yes, we will do that.  And do a little pool talk when we get back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  A little talk about the old pool.  Hey, someone died over the weekend.  We'll tell you when we get back.  It's in fucking Jimmy's colon, apparently.  Wow.  That is horrible.  Don't do that, Sam.  That's toxic.  You're spraying toxins.  Oh, horrible.  Really bad.  It is really bad.  I ate pork.  I ate fucking a little bit of steak.  I ate Bob's wife made whoopee pies and cookies.  You just said, I ate Bob's wife.  No, no, no.  I didn't mean that.  I ate a lot of stuff.  That smells pretty good.  Come on, Sam.  This toxicity. 
[00:54:00]  See, now we're all going to get sick.  It's terrible.  All right.  Go to break and we'll tell you about it when we get back.  All right.  The Opinant 3 Channel.  Oh, yeah.  On Sirius XM.  Gather round, kids, for a tale of childhood trauma.  It's a molestation memory with our friend, Jim Florentine.  My dad used to take us to wrestling matches at Madison Square Garden.  And we met this guy out front who would sell wrestling pictures.  This fat guy, 300 pounds, a bad mustache. 
[00:54:30]  You know, and we became friends with him somehow.  He's like, oh, give me your address.  So he started sending us pictures of all the kids in the neighborhood.  Then he would call me on the phone and tell me about the match the night before.  And my voice was about this.  It was this deep at 14.  He's on the other end and I'm asking all these questions and he's fucking breathing heavy.  I had no idea.  But then he wound up staying over my house.  He knew all the kids in the neighborhood because we all go to the matches.  He convinced my dad. 
[00:55:00]  He's like, oh, you know, I want to hang with the kids on a Saturday afternoon.  He took the bus from New York, the middle of Jersey.  And my parents are a little weird about it.  Like, I don't know.  But like, all right.  You know, they talk to the other parents and neighbor.  You think this is all right?  You know, he's a 40-year-old guy hanging around 14-year-olds.  They put him in the guest room the night before.  I wake up in the morning.  I'm sleeping.  He has his hand down my pants.  He snuck down there.  And I fucking jump.  I go, what are you doing?  He grabbed my cock.  He goes, I'm showing you a magic trick.  I'm like, a magic trick?  I just said, I ran to the door to go tell my brothers, my older brothers. 
[00:55:30]  And he blocked the door.  He goes, he went right to the photo album.  He goes, look, I'll give, I got 50 pictures.  And I'll give you 35 of them if you don't say anything.  But my brothers were like, my brothers afterwards go, you've got to tell mom and dad  about this.  I go, no, because they were going to make me get the pictures back.  I'm like, fuck that.  I earned them.  Fucking kissed him on the cheek.  I sat on his lap.  He grabbed my cock.  I should have got that in his camera.  This has been a molestation moment with our friend, Jim Florentine.  Now you know why he is the way he is.  Serious, serious accents. 
[00:56:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I just want to say, you know, can we, can we all get along?  Can we, can we get along?  Um, can we stop making a lot of money?  Making it, making it horrible for, for the, for the older people and the, and the, and  the, and the kids.  Oh, wow.  He mixed it up.  Look at E-Rock.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:56:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And thrown in jail, we can put toe-to-toe in the middle of a sale.  Fuckin' with me, cause I'm a teenager.  With a little bit of gold and a pager.  Oh, a pager.  This is old.  Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics.  You rather see me in the pen, then me and low benzo rollin' in the benzo.  Beat the police outta shape, and when I finish, bring the yellow tape.  You like this rap, right?  I love this old-school fuckin' gangsta rap show. 
[00:57:00]  It's funny.  Ice kid!  Yeah.  Well, I guess, uh, I guess we lost, uh, we lost a very important person in the civil rights  movement, according to Reverend Al Sharpton.  He didn't say that.  Yeah.  Yes, he did.  Yeah.  He was on, uh, MSNBC, of course, where he can just hawk his fuckin' bullshit, and they, 
[00:57:30]  uh, present it as some type of news.  Yeah, and, um, yeah, Rodney King, you might remember him.  A lot of people don't remember who he was.  It's weird when you think of how long ago that was.  A lot of the, uh, younger people growing up in this day and age, they have no clue who  the fuck that motherfucker was.  Yeah.  Uh, but Rodney King, um, uh, was, uh, uh, pummeled on videotape in 91, was it?  I think so. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, 91.  And, um, yeah, he was pummeled, uh, with some nightsticks by some LAPD-Ospers.  Wow.  Uh, because he was driving, uh, erratically, uh, running from the police in his car.  Apparently, he had been smoking crack.  And then, when they got him out of the car, he was, uh, trying to get back up off the ground.  And, um, so they were trying to, you know, hey, stay down there. 
[00:58:30]  Get your hands behind your back.  Why isn't he just laying down with his hands behind his back?  I don't know why.  Like, he should have just stayed down with his hands behind his back.  Look, he's trying to get up again.  He was all fucked up, too, wasn't he?  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't know what's going on.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  They're dual arms fucking swinging for the fences.  They could have cuffed him right there.  We're watching the, uh, video.  Well, uh, yeah.  I disagree with you on that.  I don't even know what you think.  Well, you know what?  They could have, uh, grabbed his arms and tried to put his arms on his back.  You're right.  I see it.  But, uh, at that point, I think that was, uh, SOP.  Uh, Standard Operating Procedure. 
[00:59:00]  Uh.  Right there.  Now, meanwhile, uh, there's a passenger in that car.  Uh, and, uh, the passenger shut the fuck up, didn't he?  Yeah.  There's a passenger in that car.  See, right there, they got him.  They could cuff him.  That's unnecessary.  And, like, when-  Look, he's trying to get back up again.  Well, because he's being beaten on the ground.  Like, this is one where I understand the first X amount of hits.  And I firmly believe they've got to protect themselves.  Yeah.  But then cops are like, you don't understand, you don't-  And you're right.  But just because I don't understand doesn't mean it's- 
[00:59:30]  It's always right.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, you're right.  That was out of line.  And, uh, I know that there's video that the tape parted I didn't see.  Yeah.  But that was one of those things where, no, you can't, you know, come on, man.  I think they just-  I think he just pissed them off really bad.  They did what I would want to do.  Beat a guy for running for me.  Boy, what a fucking bad circumstance that was.  They had the headlights right on them, so it's all lit up like daylight.  They're pounding them, and some asshole's got a video fucking camera.  That was the first one of those, right? 
[01:00:00]  That was the one of the first-  Yeah, that was really the one that put it over.  That was the first viral video.  Yeah, that one did go viral.  That changed everything, man, because from now on, everything you did, you had to make sure was not being taped.  Yeah.  Yeah, they didn't think anything was going to come of this, because they're just pounding on him.  And they're like, what, is somebody going to fucking record it and send it to a TV or something?  Ha ha ha!  That was nine of them.  Keep hitting them!  Keep hitting them!  Who gives a shit?  Well, yeah, Rodney King, he later got like over three million bucks in a settlement. 
[01:00:30]  Downgate.  And he died over the weekend.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  He's another celebrity rehab success story.  One of Dr. Drew's miracles.  Another one of Dr. Drew's fucking patients on his reality show, Celebrity Rehab, that are dead.  That list is growing, man. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  Well, the Rodney King, not so much the beating, the acquittal of the officers, they were acquitted.  Yep.  And that spurred the L.A. riots, which killed, I guess, over 50 people, maybe 55 people, and  injured 4,000, and left a bunch of people homeless, left a swath of Los Angeles burned  down, and left Reginald Denny with a plate in his head.  That dumb motherfucker.  Hit the gas, stupid. 
[01:01:30]  They were ripping people out of cars at lights and just pummeling them.  Yeah, that's no time to worry that you're going to get a ticket for a red light.  You've got to go, motherfucker.  You gots to go.  Look at that motherfucker's just going, get out of here.  I'm gone.  I'm gone, bitch.  We're looking at the intersection.  Wow, that's a bad fucking area.  One of the intersections in L.A. during the riots, and they're just pulling people out.  These guys aren't stopping.  Why would you have stopped? 
[01:02:00]  Why would you stop?  Why would you stop?  Look at that guy in the white pickup truck, just almost ran people over.  He knows the deal.  He's speeding.  I'm getting home.  I'm leaving, motherfucker.  Holy shit.  Wow, that looks bad.  Imagine just being a white guy walking into that and go, what's up, guys?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What happened?  What's up, man?  What happened, fellas?  What happened?  Oh, man.  They're almost hitting each other in the intersection.  Oh, look at that. 
[01:02:30]  A little accident, and now they're just walking up to the car, and they're going to be dragging  people out and wrecking their cars.  Why don't you just back up and pull out?  People don't know how to react in emergency situations.  I don't know.  Just get the fuck out of it.  What's that thing with smoke coming out of it?  That was, uh...  It looked like a fire extinguisher.  He was just, uh...  Oh, like his car's driving away.  And they're beating the shit out of the back of the car.  Boy, what a scary fucking situation that would be to be in.  Absolutely.  Man. 
[01:03:00]  Just run people over.  They're throwing fucking bottles and shit at white people's cars.  Rocks, yeah.  Oh, man.  Wasting a lot of fucking malt liquor.  See, man.  Burning the place down.  Yeah, well, uh...  Rodney King, um...  Died.  He died in his pool.  Uh...  Sunday, I gather, right?  He, uh...  He was, uh...  His fiancée says, smoking a little weed.  Wow.  Drinking a little.  And, um...  She heard him outside.  He was kind of, you know, talking or something to himself, I guess. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know.  And, uh...  She went outside to see what up.  And he was at the bottom of the pool.  She then called 911.  Wow.  And I guess in a, um...  Uh...  Uh...  A panic.  She didn't jump in and try to pull him out.  What?  I don't know what that's about.  She didn't jump in.  Perhaps she was concerned for her own safety. 
[01:04:00]  Maybe she was not a very strong swimmer, either.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Obviously, Rodney was not a good swimmer.  Rodney, uh...  Yeah.  Drown in the pool.  Well, I guess the autopsy will show if there was any kind of, uh...  Medical problem.  I'm gonna guess heart attack.  Are ya?  Because what else wouldn't you be...  Like, in that moment, what else are you doing where you die in the pool and can't get out?  I'm gonna guess heart attack.  How about, uh...  He passed out?  Maybe, sure.  How about he was, uh, fuckin' drunk and stoned or something. 
[01:04:30]  Maybe he hit his head.  Yeah.  You know, I guess this will all come out in an autopsy, but, uh, you know, regardless.  Uh, dead.  It is weird that she didn't jump in and pull him out.  Like, think that'd be her first...  Yeah, she was very kind of concerned about him, but didn't jump in.  You'd think it's like just reflex.  Even if you don't think you could swim.  Yeah.  Just like something.  Instead of just waiting for the cops to show up and watching him at the bottom of the pool,  seconds ticking away like hours.  Was he still there when she came, when they got there?  Yes!  They pulled him out of the pool.  Because if he's not dead...  And he tried CPR. 
[01:05:00]  He's definitely gonna be dead after the cops come.  For sure, for sure.  Right!  You can't just lay at the pool.  You gotta jump in and grab him.  Yeah.  Unless you have, like, good clothes on.  You think maybe she's the, uh, sole heir to his $3 million will?  You know what?  That could be it.  I don't think he's got that money anymore.  He probably didn't swim, but she was probably like,  Rodney, why don't you go take a dip?  She had a deep end put in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A deep end put in.  When he was out.  Yeah, he, uh...  I would be like, yo...  What'd you, Chip?  Yeah, that's funny. 
[01:05:30]  They gave him CPR.  They tried, but pronounced dead at the hospital.  I'm sure he was just, you know, gone the whole way.  But, uh...  And then I heard this rumor.  It's a rumor, right?  That the daughter of one of the cops that beat him  was actually one of the cops that showed up first on scene.  Really?  Yeah.  Coon?  Coon.  You know the cop?  Coons, right?  Coons.  The cop was named Coons, right?  Yeah, Coons, I think.  Wow.  And, uh...  Was it Stacey Coons?  Am I remembering that right?  I'm not sure.  But I heard that.  Um...  That it was, uh... 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, the daughter...  Coon.  Coon.  It's just Coon.  It's not Coons, right?  Is it Stacey or no?  It was.  Stacey Coon.  Okay.  Hey, Stacey.  Isn't this great?  Yeah, isn't this great?  Uh, yeah.  Stacey, uh, Coon.  And, uh...  What was Mr. Coon's name?  No.  I think that...  What was his, uh, the officer?  Stacey Coon.  Yeah, I think Stacey Coon was his name.  That's a guy.  I thought that was the daughter.  No.  He does have a girl's name.  Girl, you've been Mr. Girlie Racist's name. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, girl racist name guy.  So they're saying his daughter might have showed up to the scene?  That, uh...  Yeah, that's what somebody said.  I'm looking here to see if anybody's got more info on it.  But I could just be blathering out my asshole about this whole thing.  I'd be like that movie Crash.  That would be, right?  There's no news on it, right?  Then it was all fucking horse shit.  I'm just spreading more lies.  More lies.  Um, yeah, so dead.  And then, uh, Twitter. 
[01:07:00]  A light!  Ha ha ha!  A light last night with haunting, uh, 140 character tributes to the late Rodney King.  Um, of course I had to join right in.  Good.  I, uh, I clicked on the hashtag Rodney King, and I found a bunch of people that were tweeting,  uh, uh, about Rodney King.  And, uh, of course I found a few and commented back, and, uh, uh, much to their chagrin.  That's the thing about Ant, like, people are leaving their tributes, and then this stranger 
[01:07:30]  from the radio that they've never heard of is just insulting them.  Has to insult them, their cause, their people, their everything.  Yeah, uh, none too happy.  But one, one thing I was getting was, they really were placing this guy on a pedestal  like he was some kind of fucking hero.  Yeah.  Uh, he took a, a sound thrashing, uh, before and after the beating.  He was not a model citizen.  This motherfucker was, uh, arrested after the beating for things like, um, domestic, uh, 
[01:08:00]  violence, drug charges, some more shenanigans in his automobile.  Uh, just, uh, not, not a very law-abiding citizen.  And, uh, I don't know how they're putting him up as a hero.  I guess when you got the likes of Al Sharpton and, and fucking Jesse Jackson as your, your  leaders, you really kind of aim low when it comes to people to make your heroes.  So a, uh, a drug addict, uh, resisting arrest guy that, uh, put other people's lives in 
[01:08:30]  danger by speeding down, uh, uh, residential streets, uh, all of a sudden becomes this, um,  icon of, uh, the civil rights movement.  They don't exactly have to be infallible.  No.  Or out-of-fallible?  Ah, it was foul.  That would be, yeah.  You want to go through, uh, Rodney King's arrest record before and after?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Let's hear, uh, some of the things Rodney King did.  Uh, King's troll with the law prior to his beating, uh, July 27, 87, according to a complaint  filed by his wife, King beat her while she was sleeping, then dragged her out, uh, outside 
[01:09:00]  of the house and beat her again.  All right.  King was charged with battery and pleaded no contest.  And then in 89, Rodney King brandishing a tire iron, ordered a convenience store clerk,  to empty the cash register.  Oh.  So that's some armed robbery right there.  Uh, 91.  Oh, that was his arrest.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then after his arrest, uh, in May, he was pulled over for having an excessively tinted  windshield.  All right.  That's nothing.  King was driving without a license and his car registration had expired.  So there's that. 
[01:09:30]  King, I believe the cops probably pulled him over because of his tinted face.  The LAPD.  Yeah, those next two are not very impressive pullovers.  His excessively tinted skin.  Let's see.  In 91, he was, uh, he picked up a transvestite prostitute in Hollywood.  So they probably stopped him to congratulate him.  Good boy, Rodney.  92.  You're a good egg.  His second wife, uh, reported that he had hit her and she feared for her life, but then  she dropped the charges.  DWI.  He crashed a car.  It goes on forever.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  And then in 2001, King was arrested for indecent exposure and use of the hallucinogen PCP. 
[01:10:00]  He loved his PCP from what I heard.  What, he yanked his penis out somewhere?  Uh, yeah, probably.  Or probably ripped his clothes off.  People on PCP like, like, ripping their clothes off and running.  It makes you hot or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, it raises your court temperature and you feel like you're burning or something.  Yeah, so you gotta, like, take your clothes off.  I don't know.  Sounds fun.  Get in the pool.  Everyone in the pool.  Oh, you know what?  Maybe, right?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he could have been all fucked up.  Thought he was just fucking walking around at the bottom of a big fucking empty pool. 
[01:10:30]  Starts breathing.  It's over.  Yeah, people were very upset.  I did notice that the people that were making Rodney King is dead jokes, as opposed to the  people that were...  People were making jokes?  Yes.  There were some jokes in very bad taste.  And the people that were supporting Rodney King and saying, uh, rest in peace and whatnot,  uh, very much down racial lines.  I did notice that.  Yeah.  Black people were very supportive of Rodney King, while, uh, the white devil was more apt 
[01:11:00]  to make fun of him and joke.  As the devil would, by the way.  As the devil does.  Every time somebody dies, it's a new thing.  They were kind of making comparisons between Rodney and Whitney Houston.  Uh, the fact that they both drowned.  The fact that there is a stereotype out there that, uh, black people, not the strongest of  swimmers.  I did point that out in my tweet.  Yes.  And there was a couple of black people, not many, who took umbrage.  Oh. 
[01:11:30]  That I, and, uh, I don't think they were prepared, because one guy's like, fuck you, that's  messed up.  So I wrote, fuck you.  It's funny.  And then, uh, he protected his tweets.  Oh, he did.  I, yeah, I guess there was just too many creeps.  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, you know what, and, and, obviously, when I get on Twitter, I, uh, I am, uh, regardless  of what you think, in the public eye.  And, uh, I realize what I can and can't put on Twitter.  Really?  I know this. 
[01:12:00]  I skirt the line.  You sure do.  I...  You're like that guy who's walking over Niagara Falls.  Right.  Yeah.  But I don't have a safety line.  No, you don't.  I, I, but I do notice, uh, that, uh, that some people have no fucking barrier whatsoever.  So I will, uh, try to use, to try to craft those 140 characters into an, uh, an entire  idea, um, whereas some people, uh, uh, just need six letters.  That's all they need. 
[01:12:30]  And they post that.  For Rodney?  Uh, well, yeah, I guess so.  You could say that.  What six letters?  Jesus.  It just really, it's amazing to me.  And then I get fucking pissed off that my name is attached to it.  You know, they retweet me something I say.  And then it's like, yeah, good thing, you fucking, uh, all right.  All right.  A little subtlety goes a long way.  Yeah.  That isn't necessary. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, why?  Yeah.  So people are very upset along racial lines, though.  And when you start, uh, pointing out facts and stuff about Rodney King and his arrest record  and the fact that perhaps, uh, running from the cops wasn't the best idea, uh, they turn  him into a civil rights hero.  So you were, you were on the side of the white devil last night.  I was probably one of the white devils last night.  But as, uh, it was pointed out to me by many black people, that I was a piece of shit.  And, uh, believe me, there's plenty of white people that want to say that, too. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, I know.  Now, wait, Sarah from Buffalo says, uh, TMZ's reporting that the fiance's friends have made  different statements to the police because her story keeps changing.  Oh, shit!  I read that this morning.  That there was, like, her story keeps changing?  Something shady may be going on.  Who knows?  Oh, don't say that.  Come on.  The fiance's story keeps changing in that, uh, some neighbors might have hurt him.  You know, like, a crash or a struggle or something.  Oh!  Like an argument? 
[01:14:00]  Uh, not, not, no, a crash, a specific physical struggle.  A crash or some kind of physical struggle.  Oh.  Which is interesting.  What's, uh...  I wonder between who and who.  Was it Rodney and the fiance?  Did the fiance have a gentleman friend?  Mmm.  Ah.  Were they arguing and did she hit him with a bottle or something?  Throw him in the pool.  Throw him in the pool.  Or is the fiance just a red herring?  Ah.  Red?  A red herring.  What did he read?  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:14:30]  Oh.  Rodney King's neighbors heard a, uh, commotion at his house.  Ooh.  A commotion.  Who's the fat one?  A commotion.  Oh, man.  That's probably Fatso coming through the fucking screen door.  Oh.  What a fat lady.  Oh, look at her.  Lumps of fat on her back.  She's got them back tits in the middle of her back, at the top of her back, lower back.  Yeah.  Uh, what are they saying about that there?  Neighbors heard a commotion.  It just sounded like someone was really sad, she said.  There was a lot of moaning and crying. 
[01:15:00]  Another person was trying to console that person.  Huh.  Well, that's an odd thing.  I can't try to come up with some kind of, um, a theory in this.  She said it was several hours later when she heard a splash, and that's when Paramax arrived.  Oh, that's probably when they jumped in to get him.  He was 47.  He wasn't that old.  No.  Oh, poor, uh, poor little Rodney King.  Last night I heard a little bit of a commotion.  It really wasn't like a fight fight, sort of yelling back and forth.  Bunch of nosy fucking neighbors. 
[01:15:30]  Keep your fucking ears in your house.  Jesus.  Hell.  Rodney King can't just hang out.  Get killed by his wife.  Yeah.  Wife.  Get killed, but perhaps get killed.  Allegedly.  Not even allegedly.  Not even fucking inferred or rumored or implied or anything.  Made up.  This guy says, uh, Corey Hudson, who lives a few blocks away, said King often enjoyed swimming at all hours of the night.  So, I mean, he was an okay swimmer.  Yeah, he was a strong swimmer. 
[01:16:00]  He wasn't like Jason Voorhees as a boy.  No.  It says in an interview this year, earlier, uh, Rodney King said,  America's been good to me after I paid the price and stayed alive through it all.  This part of my life is the easy part now.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Hmm, that's interesting that he actually went, uh, swimming at night.  So, it's not like he just, you know, was afraid of the pool or anything.  He was in there.  Heard moaning and crying hours before Rodney King found dead. 
[01:16:30]  That's so weird.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Well, I'm sure the cops are really going to look into this thoroughly.  All right.  Yeah.  Bury him.  Fuck it.  Open a check case here, boy.  It's obvious what happened.  Yep.  He tripped.  He was swimming and he tripped.  Enough for Rodney King.  Had it with this guy.  Oh, Rodney.  Yeah.  Eh.  You know.  Everybody likes making the jokes on Twitter now when anybody dies. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  But that's what it is now.  Black people don't really joke about that, though.  No, no, they don't.  That's not black humor.  Like, they'll talk about death, but they don't shit on people when they die.  Mm-mm.  I told you, the only argument I ever had with a black guy on Twitter was that rapper because  he got mad at me over my Steve Jobs joke.  Oh, he didn't even like Steve Jobs was a...  No, no, he didn't like my Steve Jobs joke, so he just said something rude to me, so I  kept going back at him.  I think it's because so many black people are religious. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, I think it's...  You think you're fine with Christianity.  Yeah, that's the same reason they got pissed off at Obama for coming out in favor of gay  marriage.  Right.  Right.  They're all very religious people.  Very God-fearing Baptists, I believe.  A lot of Baptists.  The religion there.  I don't know what that's all about.  I don't know.  They just baptize themselves all the time.  My dad was...  My grandfather was a Baptist minister.  Was he?  Was he?  In the South, in Kentucky.  Was he black?  No.  Very religious?  Yeah, my grandfather was very...  Were a lot of black people in his church?  I don't know. 
[01:18:00]  Probably not at that time.  Nobody wants to hear the Robert sermon.  Oh, God, right?  Listen to this dumbass cracker motherfucker.  What'd he know about Johns the Baptist and shit?  He was an intelligent man, I'm sure.  Yeah?  Is he dead?  He's dead now, yeah.  He died in 1989.  Oh, did you miss him?  I don't know.  I knew him very little.  I mean, 83 to 89.  Senior six?  That's right.  Oh, that's sad.  I had to have a sad, kind of reflective Father's Day because, you know, my father's dead. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  So, I had to, like, think about that.  I was thinking he's probably, you know, he's probably kind of proud that I didn't turn  out to be the faggot he thought I would be.  Would he be...  Oh, he'd probably love your lifestyle now.  He might.  He might, yeah, yeah.  He'd probably think you were awesome.  He might think...  He might think...  He might think...  Yeah, but he might...  I don't know.  See, that's just it.  I don't know.  He might not think it was the straight and narrow, you know?  Like, like, ah, you're a little crazy.  He would have wanted you to be married?  Probably, like, married to prove that I wasn't, in his words, a fucking queer. 
[01:19:00]  Was he worried about that?  Oh, he worried about it, like, constantly.  Constantly that his little Anthony was going to be a queer.  Did he like you hanging out with Richard?  No!  That was, like, fucking bait.  That was crazy.  How would he have felt...  Richard was flamboyantly gay, even at, like, a very early age.  Before he even knew, everyone knew this kid was going to turn out gay. 
[01:19:30]  How would he have felt about you working in entertainment?  Well, he probably would have liked the cash.  Yeah.  Things like that.  But he probably would have liked me to stay in construction, I think.  More of a manly venture.  Something like that.  I don't think he would have really liked me hobnobbing with the fags, as he would call them.  Okay.  The queer.  So he didn't approve of your friendship with Richard?  Well, I think he blocked it out of his head. 
[01:20:00]  He, like, because we knew Richard when he was young enough that, you know, the whole sexuality thing didn't really come into play.  Right.  So he was just kind of a goofy, kind of femmy kid, you know?  But then as he grew up, then you kind of saw, all right, we see what's coming now.  And it's a dick in his face.  So would he say anything to you, your dad?  He would just look sometimes at Richard, like, walking or talking or saying something.  And as we drove away, he'd roll the window up and go, Jesus Christ. 
[01:20:30]  Son of a bitch.  You know, he would just know, like, he'd spit out the little piece of tobacco that was on the end of the filter from the Territon.  Jesus Christ.  Shake his head, but not say anything.  Not say, like, oh, that kid's what they call gay or anything.  Well, he probably didn't want you to even know it was an option.  Right, right.  Because he's very worried that you would succumb to that lifestyle. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, he worried.  The second I showed any type of emotion or weakness, any tears.  You cried a lot when you were a kid, right?  Oh, I was the biggest crybaby.  I loved crying.  It was like an attention getter for me.  Whenever I would cry, oh, my mom would be like, oh, what happened?  Oh, they were mean at school.  Oh, someone said your cookies looked like dog shit. 
[01:21:30]  But I went dog do.  Ew, they said your mom's cookies looked like dog do.  Did they?  Did they?  Yeah.  It was like one of those days where everybody had to come into school and bring, like, food in from your culture.  And you brought your mom's dog do.  So mom got these, like, Italian cookies or something.  Your mom made caca cookies.  And they looked like little nuggets of shit.  Just like your son.  And someone said, yeah, what did your mom make little shit balls? 
[01:22:00]  I would have had such a good time making fun of your mom's doody cookies when I was a kid.  And then I just started crying.  And I felt so bad that my mom had done this and that he was making fun of it that I went home and I just started crying about that.  And then one day I actually came home and I wasn't crying when I came home, but I had to say, I was crying in school today.  Why?  I had to tell him like I'm fucking talk show.  Why would you?  Hey, I was crying in school today. 
[01:22:30]  Why'd you say that?  Because I wanted the sympathy.  Ew.  Knee.  Ew.  That was right.  Oh, he was.  Oh, did he whip me right into shape?  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  So would he discourage you from hanging out with Richard after a while?  Oh, wow.  I got to really think about that.  I don't think he discouraged it.  The thing is, I left California pretty soon after Richard really like it was like, all right, this guy's gay. 
[01:23:00]  You know, this guy's pretty gay.  And I came back to New York.  But before that, no, there really wasn't.  But he knew he was just kind of shaking his head.  But then, you know, when I wasn't hanging out with Richard, my father always made sure I had plenty of guns on me.  I was riding horseback.  I was hunting things.  You know, man things.  I was getting hurt and not crying.  What have you got?  You've gotten scared after Brokeback Mountain came out of having you ride horses?  Oh, my God. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, shit.  What did I do?  He'd have been shitting.  He'd have been shitting himself.  Oh, no.  Even cowboys can be gay.  This is crazy.  Stop fucking riding horses.  Don't do anything.  Lock me in my room.  Yeah, he...  Did you ever tell him about the Richard Treefort thing?  No.  Oh, God.  I can only...  That's the only thing I'm thankful about, that he's dead.  That he never got to hear that Richard tried to suck my dick in the treefort.  Can you imagine if he had heard it on the air for the first time?  Oh, my God.  Oh, how great would that have been? 
[01:24:00]  Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, he wouldn't have enjoyed that story at all.  No.  No.  Oh.  But he'd have been like, yeah, that figures.  He'd have probably talked to his wife at the time, Corey, and been like, you know, I knew  that kid was a faggot.  You know, it's old school talking.  Yeah.  That's how they talked back then.  And when my father wanted me to be a man and not be effeminate, he would say, you know, 
[01:24:30]  grow up, don't be a fag.  Or, you know, don't be a queer.  He loved the word queer.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He used that more than fag.  But, I don't know.  I just...  I stopped my emotions.  I shut everything off like a Vulcan.  How old were you when you shut your emotions off?  I believe I finally was able to attain true emotional shutoff at 16 years old.  Wow.  I was able to finally just cut it loose.  Is that when you left California?  Yeah.  And you missed Richard. 
[01:25:00]  It was grieving your love.  Was it?  Yeah, that's what it was.  Makes sense.  So I shut my emotions off so I wouldn't feel so hurt that I missed Richard.  Yeah, you didn't want to think about Richard.  What about Buzz?  Why didn't I miss Buzz?  She wasn't young with her whole future ahead of her.  Buzz was a mess.  Buzz was 19.  Exactly.  Buzz sucked.  Buzz.  Her best days were behind her at 19.  You knew that you and Richard would never go exploring,  and your young adulthood again.  Oh, yeah.  What I could have done.  Where I could have been right now.  Six feet under. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Sarcoma.  Yeah.  Although you would have been a top.  Yeah, I knew something was amiss when Richard was talking about hanging out with Joey Butler,  who, of course, was called Joey Buttlicker.  And he talked about how he watched Joey Buttlicker sit on one of his bedposts  and put the little wooden decorative ornament on the top of the bedpost right up Joey Buttlicker's ass.  Joey Buttlicker pulled his pants down and said, watch, and slid down on it. 
[01:26:00]  And Richard conveyed this story to me, and I'm like, wow, that's fucked up.  How old was Joey Buttlicker?  Joey Buttlicker was probably 12, 13.  And he was shoving bedknobs up his ass?  Bedknobs and broom handles, I guess.  Wow.  Did you have a tenting erection to the story?  I was jerking off.  What do you mean?  And when Richard told me this, this is what you call the confusion of youth.  Yeah.  I was very confused. 
[01:26:30]  I didn't get why Joey Buttlicker would sit on a wooden bedpost and Richard would be in the room  and then tell me about this.  Because I assume now that Richard probably sucked Joey Buttlicker's dick while Joey Buttlicker  had the wooden ball up his ass on the bed.  And he was trying to get you to shove a bedknobs up your ass.  And trying to see what my reaction was going to be like, wow, that's cool.  Like, ooh.  You guys had an amazing childhood.  I had no idea any of this was going on.  I was sitting at home playing with wrestling toys, and Jim was getting his dick sucked under a porch. 
[01:27:00]  And you were having your friends shove bedknobs up their ass.  Well, I didn't really know Joey Buttlicker that well.  I knew him.  I didn't really hang out with him.  He was like, Richard was the go-between, friend between me and him.  I never really liked Joey Buttlicker.  Of course not.  He shoved bedknobs up his ass.  He shoved bedknobs up his ass.  Just sat on the bedknobs.  All I did was picture, like, what did he do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How could a 12-year-old's ass be that loose to shove a bedknobs up there? 
[01:27:30]  He probably just knew that his asshole would feel good.  He probably tickled it a little bit and started putting things in.  Because he probably did it a lot.  He probably stretched his ass out by 12 years old.  Shit-stained bedknobs out of his room.  Just mom walks in like, what's going on in here?  It just smells like shit.  You think he was gay?  Joey Buttlicker?  No.  He shoved a bedknobs up his ass and probably had Richard blow him at the same time.  No, that's completely straight.  What a trooper Richard was.  Oh, Richard was like the town whore.  Just the guy loved sucking dick. 
[01:28:00]  He fucking just loved sucking dick.  He was, um...  There was some other, like, hippie guy.  And he was redoing his trailer.  He lived in a trailer.  Not even like a big trailer thing.  This small little...  Like one of those Airstream things or whatever they're called.  Trailers.  On the side of someone else's house.  And, uh...  Richard would go over every night and help him, like, fix up this trailer.  Varnishing the woodwork.  And, well, whatever they call it.  Whatever those kids called it back then. 
[01:28:30]  Uh, and making sure everything, uh, was done.  And I can only...  Uh, no, I guarantee he was fucking sucking that guy's dick.  How old was that guy?  He loved dick.  He was probably...  It's hard to judge when you're that age how old other people are.  But, uh...  It was probably, at most, 20.  Maybe 20, yeah.  Early 20s, maybe.  Like that.  Richard, uh...  And then Richard, you know, as we all know, wound up dying of the AIDS. 
[01:29:00]  Did he live out there the whole life?  Yeah, yeah.  He moved from Capistrano to Lake Elsinore.  And, um...  When I found out from Corey that he was dead, she was very vague.  I was like, oh, have you heard anything from Richard?  She goes, oh, I don't know.  Richard died.  I'm like, oh, man.  What happened?  Oh, he was...  He just was, um, really ill.  And she brought up, like, pneumonia.  And stuff.  I'm like, okay, alright.  So I kind of fucking, uh, googled, like, uh, the obituary or something. 
[01:29:30]  And it's like, oh, this has AIDS written all over it.  How old was he when he died?  Um, well, I believe he died, um...  Hmm, I'm not even sure.  Maybe 2000?  Around there?  That's pretty...  Because if he was sucking all that dick all the way back then, how young must he have been when he got AIDS?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Who knows?  Yeah.  He was 40 when he died, baby?  Yeah, probably something like that.  Yeah.  Just fucking loved dick.  He loved it so much.  Wow.  Where did he move to at the Capistrano? 
[01:30:00]  Uh-oh.  Just waiting for it.  Well, Chip, Lake Elsinore.  Oh, how come Lake El couldn't sleep properly?  Snore.  Double God.  Jesus.  He had you to set him back up for that one.  Yeah, he did.  And I don't know what happened to Joey Buttlicker, no.  I don't know the fate of Joey Buttlicker.  He's the guy from the One Guy, One Jar video.  It could be.  That's just some weird shit, man. 
[01:30:30]  That was the oddest place to grow up.  Just, things were happening.  It was so weird.  Everyone wanted to fuck.  It was just a weird thing.  Fuck a bed, fuck whoever.  It didn't matter how old you were, how young you were.  It was just fucking was going on.  What was your horse's name?  Nightmare.  No, what was some of the other horse's names?  Concho Pete.  Yeah.  Concho Pete.  Concho Pete was the stud around the stable.  He was an Appaloosa, a blanketed Appaloosa, with a giant cock. 
[01:31:00]  And, yeah, Concho Pete had the big dick.  Concho Pete ruled.  Yep.  He had the biggest dick of all the horses.  Oh, the biggest dick.  Yeah.  I do recall, yeah, I do recall Concho Pete.  Richard loved Concho Pete.  Of course he did.  Just loved looking at Concho Pete. 
[01:31:30]  That big dick on Concho Pete.  Oh, Concho Pete.  Is Concho Pete still alive?  Oh, Concho Pete's long dead, I'm sure.  Should have stuffed his cock, though.  Just fucking put that thing on display.  Take it around the country.  Mounted it on the wall.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was just ridiculous.  Concho Pete.  Concho Pete.  Yeah.  Yeah, he just fucking...  That and around Jimmy Jackson's ranch.  Like, it was just all debauchery going on there.  Everyone was fucking everybody. 
[01:32:00]  That Indian...  She was like a woo-woo-woo Indian at a party, and she wanted to fuck me, but she had a fucking  boyfriend that looked like Billy Bear from 48 Hours.  Oh, yeah.  Indian with the knife.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was petrified of him.  He's a politician now, but yeah.  Is he?  Yeah.  No way.  Really?  Billy Bear?  He's a mean-looking motherfucker.  Billy Bear.  Yes, I was petrified.  I would have taken a role with her, but that and then Jimmy Jackson's wife, Patty, was... 
[01:32:30]  I thought she was hot, too, and Jimmy Jackson went to the office.  I went to the auction once, and Patty was home, and I was there, and she called me into the  room, and I thought I was going to fuck her and stuff, and I'm like all fucking full  of cum.  I'm a kid, just waiting to fuck, and she goes, come on, come on in the bed, and I'm ready  to get in the bed, and Jimmy Jackson came bursting out of the closet with a shotgun.  You son of a bitch!  Is he goof?  He was always joking, that Jimmy Jackson. 
[01:33:00]  Always joking.  He's got a million of them.  And all I was thinking was, I was going to get into the bed with her dummy.  Yeah, I was going...  Jesus, some joke.  You expose the fact that I would fuck your wife if you were really in Chino at the auction.  Do you wish he was really in Chino?  Yes!  Yes!  I loved Patty Porter.  And then I was thinking about Jimmy Jackson and his little daughter, Shiloh, who we used  say, was turning into a nigger.  And she would cry. 
[01:33:30]  She had a little speech impediment, and she would cry and go, I don't want to be a nigger!  That was adorable.  That's horrible.  They would actually taunt her with that.  Taunt her!  How old is she now?  Man.  Put it this way.  She was probably three in 1975.  Is she black now?  I don't know.  She might have.  Jimmy Jackson.  Wait, so she's...  Wait, oh, how old were you? 
[01:34:00]  75?  Uh-oh.  Oh, wait.  But you weren't the same age as her.  She was really young.  No, she was really young.  No, no.  I didn't fuck her.  She's younger than me, then.  Yeah, she probably is.  Okay, I'm 43, so she's probably 40.  Yeah.  I don't know why I want to know how old people are.  I'm just kind of curious.  It is kind of curious.  We used to go on these campouts, too, which was the weirdest fucking thing.  The Jimmy Jackson clan, we would all go to the stable on the weekend.  He'd rent a rent string, and a bunch of Marines from Camp Pendleton would come up and shit  and not know how to ride and lose their wallets. 
[01:34:30]  It was fucking great.  I used to have to take them up into the hills.  But then when night would come around, we'd all get sleeping bags and tents, and everybody  that would hang out there would go up into the hills and camp out for the night, and  it was boys and girls.  And we would all end up in each other's sleeping bags.  And it was like the craziest fucking thing.  Like, just groping each other.  It was fucking weird.  We weren't really fucking or anything.  But there was a lot of groping going on and fucking feeling a lot of sexual organry and 
[01:35:00]  shit.  And, like, they, I think the morning rolled around, and you're still up because you're  just on such a fucking boner high.  And they kind of saw what was going on.  It was weird.  I don't know.  Maybe you were in a molested camp.  Maybe.  Maybe they would just fucking bring you up there and take pictures of little Anthony.  I don't remember a camera.  And I wasn't, you know, I don't remember anything really bad at all.  But you wouldn't remember a camera, would you?  You'd be all repressed.  What do you think?  Let me think of Jimmy Jackson.  Shut up your emotions. 
[01:35:30]  That's right, he did.  Shut up your memories.  Jimmy Sandusky.  Little Anthony Pansy.  Yeah.  Oh, well, yeah.  No, it was, I just think we were just, you know.  Being perverts.  Wacky kids being perverted.  And it was all like the kids of all the parents that would hang out with Jimmy Jackson.  So they were all just fucking hammered at the actual house by the ranch, the stable  and everything.  And we were up in the hills.  They would just leave us alone.  And guns and fucking, you know, we'd hunt forage for ourselves. 
[01:36:00]  And then get in sleeping bags with various girls and just feel each other's fucking vaginas  and wee-wees and heinies.  It was great.  You'd feel their heinies?  I'd feel their heinie.  I liked, there was this one girl, I remember she was from Tustin, and she, I can't remember  her name, but she had blonde hair, very California girl looking.  And I used to like when she was laying on her belly in the sleeping bag, and I would just 
[01:36:30]  rub her heinie.  Like just the cheeks, you'd just palm and rub?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I would like, yeah, I would just rub her heinie.  And she liked it.  She'd arched her back a lot.  Wow.  She grabbed her pussy, rookie.  Well, I did, I did, like, I did wind up grabbing her pussy, but I didn't do anything really.  Why'd you look at it?  I thought it was cool though.  And like, I loved the next day, you could smell your hand and still smell it.  As a kid, that was the fucking best thing ever.  I never liked the pussy on the hand.  It put you right back in place. 
[01:37:00]  Put you right back there, Jimmy.  I really did that.  What?  Like, I really did that.  Yeah, yeah.  It was like you could remember it.  Like, oh, I remember that.  Pussy was just a fucking amazing thing.  It still is.  Yeah, I enjoy pussy, but I just never liked the smell as a kid.  But it's like, then it was just, oh, how did you not like that?  I don't know.  It's like cotton candy.  I didn't get it like that.  Like, that was weird.  No.  I was scared at first.  You liked the smell of piss.  Yeah.  I shot past pussy.  Yeah, you certainly did. 
[01:37:30]  But yeah, there was a, there was a few girls that were really up for some shenanigans.  Right.  Hijinks.  You can always find a girl in that age group that would do something.  Yeah, there was like 12.  But you play with them a little bit.  Yeah.  You want to take a break?  Oh.  Oh, we have a phone call coming.  The phone comes in.  Oh, we do.  I have a quick plug.

[01:40:00]  Christian, do you watch Top Chef?  No.  Thank you so much for your time.  My pleasure.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Serious, Serious, Serious, XS.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome back to the... 
[01:40:30]  Nopie.  Nopie and Anthony Show.  Jimmy Norton.  No Opie today.  Nopie.  Get it?  Yeah.  He apparently, sore throat and a cold.  I'm like, oh boy.  Oh boy.  I kind of remember that one when I had that.  You know how long Anthony was out?  A week.  Uh-oh.  A week.  Yeah.  I hope he doesn't have pertussis.  Maybe he's got the pertussises.  Yeah, that was bad. 
[01:41:00]  Is our guest on the phone?  Not yet.  What's their holdup?  Oh, God.  Are we calling them or are they calling us?  Roland is checking on it.  Okay.  Yeah, we have Bill Moushey.  Moushey.  Is his name Moushey?  Yeah.  A silly name.  Bill Moushey.  Is it Moushey?  Yeah.  I bet it is.  It's French.  I bet it is.  I bet.  You don't go through your life with the name Moushey without changing it to Moushey.  Or something like that.  That's worse than having doo-doo cookies.  Like Koontz.  Not much, though.  Not much worse. 
[01:41:30]  Doo-doo cookies.  She didn't make doo-doo cookies.  Like Anthony brought in poopy cookies.  No, I didn't.  Is that doo-doo?  I didn't have doo-doo cookies.  You still did.  I cry for everything.  You know, I once told my fucking gym teacher that I couldn't get dressed and go to gym class  because I had cramps.  Oh, my God.  Ew.  What a fucking moe.  See what I thought.  I'm offended.  I thought gas pains, you know, because you're cramping, was just called cramps. 
[01:42:00]  Ew.  And I told the gym teacher I had cramps.  And he looked at me and actually said, what the fuck are you talking about?  A fucking dumb little boy is coming up and saying he's got his period.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Was Dad right?  Did you find out?  No.  What would he have said?  Jesus Christ.  You don't tell your goddamn gym teacher you got your fucking period.  No, Ro, I'll handle this. 
[01:42:30]  Shut up.  You turned him into a little faggot.  You think he would have been upset?  Oh, good.  Yeah, yeah.  Hello?  Oh.  Hello?  Yes.  Hi.  Mr. Mushy.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I had the wrong number.  Oh, Jesus.  So you wrote a book, and it's a very, very timely book.  And what is the title?  It's called Game Over, Jerry Sandusky, Penn State, and the Culture of Silence. 
[01:43:00]  It's a long title.  Yes.  Game over.  Game over, man.  So we've all been following the trial, and I guess the defense begins today, right?  Yes, it does.  They're supposed to rest as soon as the court starts today.  Now, from what I see, this is looking pretty bad for old Jer.  Old Jer.  Now, the defense is going to come out and try to discredit a lot of these witnesses that came up and said that they were victims of Jerry and his lust for children. 
[01:43:30]  What do you think about that strategy and Jerry trying to use that?  I don't think it's going to have any effect whatsoever.  Well, I've covered probably 250 criminal trials in my life.  And in cases where there's accusations from one person to another, especially in sex abuse cases, the time to do it is in cross-examination, when the witness is testifying.  Sure.  Last week, the witnesses all testified, and from my perspective, the defense did not really get into their shorts at all.  Oh, I think you're being a little... 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, you've got to get into those shorts or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  But don't they have the right to recall them?  No, not really.  There's got to be extraordinary circumstances in order to get them back in there for the efficiency of the court and for a variety of other reasons.  But, you know, normally, every case I've ever covered, man, they, like, go at them right in their face right away, and that just did not happen in this one.  In fact, Joe Amendola, the lawyer for Sandusky, stood on the courthouse steps on December 6th when they waived a preliminary hearing and sat there and rambled on for over an hour to the media, 
[01:44:30]  talking about how they were going to torture it as Mike McQuarrie, the assistant coach who told me the whole nine yards.  Yeah.  And frankly, I watched McQuarrie twice on the stand, and he was very emphatic, and the more they tried to get at him, the more emphatic he became. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The only independent witness.  Yeah, I think it's a double-edged sword there, though, because you really don't want to try to victimize the victim up there on the stand,  especially when they had just gotten done talking about their horrid experience with this gentleman,  and then the gentleman's lawyer gets up there and just starts trying to rip him apart.  It looks like he's beating up on them to the jury.  Yeah, I mean, that's a very slippery slope, man, and the bottom line is that if you don't discredit the witnesses, what do you have? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, well, you have what you have, which is a guy that was in the shower with children and very inappropriately.  Yeah, I mean, you know, the way that this thing has unfolded, it's bizarre in that Mr. Sandusky has admitted,  not only in an interview with Bob Costas, but with the New York Times, that he routinely took showers with young kids.  Yes, unbelievable. 
[01:46:00]  Actually, I want to let some of the listeners in on this conversation.  Great book, of course, Jerry Sandusky, Penn State and the Culture of Silence in bookstores now at Amazon now, actually.  You get it on Amazon, right?  Of course.  I can get it on anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Bill, how do you pronounce that last name?  Mushi.  Bill Mushi.  All right, let's go to, I guess, Paul Hargis is on the phone.  Hello, Paul.  Hi.  You're on with Bill. 
[01:46:30]  Hi.  Thank you, Mr. Richardson, for taking my call.  How are you?  Good.  I've been following this case, and I think it's a whole lot to do about nothing, to be honest with you.  I think it's a witch hunt to go after Mr. Sandusky.  Mr. Sandusky?  Yeah, I think that this whole thing is just a witch hunt.  They're going after this guy.  Bill, have you heard anybody actually say anything like this and defend Sandusky? 
[01:47:00]  Uh, yeah, I've heard that Sandusky made a big witch's brew and was trying to feed it to all the young boys.  He was hungry or something.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  I mean, that's ridiculous.  No, because I used to coach at a school, and you have interactions with the students, and everybody starts saying something, but it ain't nothing but innocence and frolicking.  Now, so, Mr. Hargis, what you're saying is that you were in a similar situation? 
[01:47:30]  I was teaching, and, you know, you can't start judging a bunch of books by their covers.  You could think that you can't interact with the students after gym class if you take a shower or something.  Well, you have a different set of codes in life than I do, but the bottom line is there's eight kids have testified.  There's another 16.  There's another seven that have been identified. 
[01:48:00]  Uh, you know, that's going to be the decision for a jury to make as to whether or not the kids have orchestrated a cover-up, which is what's ended up.  Yeah.  This guy has Hall of Fame numbers.  What was that, Paul?  He has Hall of Fame numbers, this guy.  I don't think that he did nothing wrong.  I think that they're just taking a whole bunch and making a big to-do about nothing.  Well, I'm sure if you talk to the victims, it's not nothing there, Paul.  Mr. Peters, why did you write a book about this saying all this bad stuff?  It's Mouche, or Moushi. 
[01:48:30]  I'm sorry.  Why did you write a book about this like the guy did something wrong?  There's no evidence.  Well, read the book and make your own decision.  Yeah.  Same.  I just think that everybody's jumping on this guy because he was more popular with the kids, and that makes everybody jealous.  Oh, Paul.  It does.  If you're a good coach, and they all like you, everybody wants to badmouth you.  Ooh.  Don't get angry.  Jesus. 
[01:49:00]  Bill?  Bill?  How do you think?  How do you see this ending?  What do you think happens to Jerry Sandusky?  Are you asking me?  I don't know.  I think he's going to get off.  We're having troubles with the phones this morning, and it's very difficult to hang up.  Oh, I want to talk to Mr. Shepard.  You don't even know his name.  So how do you see this ending with Jerry Sandusky?  Well, the jury's going to get the case probably later this week. 
[01:49:30]  And basically, there should be a trial.  There's 52 charges against a guy.  Yeah.  I've seen many, many trials in my life.  Me too.  Just try to talk over him.  I apologize.  I'm trying to hang up on him, but the thing is not cooperating.  But I think that the trial's going to end this week sometime.  There's a very little chance of a major defense. 
[01:50:00]  Normally, that's done on the prosecution side where they cross the enemy people.  So, you know.  Well, do you think that the defense has a chance that they call a bunch of professional witnesses  too?  They say, maybe I need to call some psychologists or something.  They're going to do that.  I ain't finished yet.  I'm saying I have to testify about the lying that these kids are doing.  I'm sure you could testify about that. 
[01:50:30]  But, you know, you're in a situation.  I don't know.  Right, Paul.  Hold on.  Let Bill talk.  Sorry.  I got a bad connection.  Well.  Now, what about sentencing?  What can Jerry face?  Well, it's all depends on what they can convict him of.  Hold on.  Bill, what kind of a sentence can this guy get?  Well, any conviction on any of the major offenses in the 52 charges would probably effectively 
[01:51:00]  be a life sentence for Sandusky.  He's 68 years old.  And, hey, could you, like, be quiet?  You're being very rude.  Paul.  I'm trying to talk to you, sir.  Shut up.  If we could get...  Don't shut up.  I'm trying to ask questions about the Sandusky case.  We don't even know what you're talking about.  Yes, I do.  And this man's being rude.  Maybe we could pot him down or something.  Anything just to get him off the fucking phone.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:51:30]  I apologize, Bill.  This wasn't even supposed to happen.  But he's so fucking annoying.  So he could get...  He could do some pretty hard...  He's gonna.  Yeah, sure.  At his age, you know, to any extent, he gets effectively a life sentence.  Right, right.  Yeah.  He's no kid.  That's for sure.  And is this gonna be a real prison, or do you think it's one of these white-collar places?  Oh, yeah.  A real one.  I mean, the Pennsylvania system does not have any really soft prisons. 
[01:52:00]  They're all medium security or above.  He would be in a secure facility.  Do you see...  All right, Paul.  Paul.  Do you see...  Do you see anybody else being responsible for this?  A lot of blame has been passed around.  A bunch of lying kids, I think.  One of the things that is very disconcerting about this whole thing, if the charges are true, 
[01:52:30]  and that is that dating back to before 1998,  a large number of people in the Penn State community had knowledge of the allegations  against Sandusky, and almost none of them came forward.  Right.  Yeah.  And that's the most disconcerting.  When you put the timeline about what these kids say...  How responsible legally do you think these people are gonna be that kept their mouths shut? 
[01:53:00]  Well, not at all.  I don't think they should be.  I don't think they should...  I think this whole thing's a big witch hunt.  Jesus Christ, could you...  Unbelievable, or what?  I'm sorry.  It really is, and I gotta be honest.  I'm talking about you.  No, I don't know why they're doing this whole witch hunt.  You're right, though.  They should be forced to not do this.  Again, I'm sorry.  Jesus Christ.  The...  Yeah, the responsibility...  Some of these people seem to be culpable. 
[01:53:30]  I mean, look at the president, I guess, of the university itself.  President Obama.  They didn't...  He didn't go as far as I think he should have gone.  Well, there's specific evidence that the president of the university had knowledge of an event that occurred in 1998.  And then, in 2002, a second event became public.  The 98 event turned out to be a no investigation.  The investigation turned nothing up. 
[01:54:00]  And then, in 2002, there's another one where this Mike McQuarrie saw...  He's a rat.  It's a...  Shut up.  It's a cover-up.  I really see this as being 100% a cover-up to try to protect the school's name and the football program.  Well, that word has been used repeatedly by the attorney general's office throughout this whole process.  What's the army got to do with this?  What?  The general?  But it has gone all the way up into the president's office. 
[01:54:30]  There's two top officials under indictment right now for perjury and false feeling to report sexual abuse of children.  They're going to trial soon, and from what has turned up in this Sandusky trial, it looks like the investigation is going to grow rather than proceed.  And then when you look on the other side of it, there are going to be civil lawsuits going on for the next 10 years, probably.  I don't doubt it, man. 
[01:55:00]  They're probably going to sue all these kids, right?  Because they were telling all these lies, and they're spreading this man's name through the dirt.  They're probably going to sue him.  They're not lying.  You think everybody's lying then?  Yeah, all 10 of them cooked up a conspiracy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They all cooked it up and then waited years and years to go by until all this happened.  I agree.  That's exactly what I...  Oh, stop it.  That's exactly what it is.  They're all telling the people to lie.  You're ridiculous.  We got Bill Mushi on the phone. 
[01:55:30]  He's got a great new book out, Jerry Sandusky, Penn State, and the Culture of Silence.  It's in bookstores and on Amazon right now.  This is...  People are so fascinated by this.  What makes people so compelled to want to know all the dirty details of stuff like this?  I don't know.  They just want to know.  Everybody's nosy.  That was a really...  That was an astute comment.  But basically, this story is like one of Shakespearean proportions. 
[01:56:00]  You've got situations where, you know, like Joe Paterno, no one has risen to such heights  to fall to such depths so quickly.  Yeah.  You know, the university, the pristine university, never been under investigation by the NCAA before.  And now, all of a sudden, this unbelievable scandal engulfs it.  And it goes back to the whole idea that it's a closed society up there in what they used  to call Happy Valley. 
[01:56:30]  And it's really a situation where they've tried to keep everything hidden.  And they went all the way to the state Supreme Court to keep Paterno's salary hidden, you  know.  And they just didn't think the outside would...  Would you let me talk for a minute?  Sure, sure.  Shut up.  Can you shut up for like 30 seconds?  I'm trying to ask a question about Joe Paterno's salary.  And you're yelling at me.  I got a bad phone connection.  And so you...  Not bad enough.  Why don't you like hang it up and then you won't have a bad phone connection? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Because I can't hear the show if I hang up.  And we got a line I had to call in and I'm an expert in this area.  No, you're not.  Yeah, sounds it.  Sounds it.  You're being very rude, sir.  I'm trying to be courteous.  I...  Well, you're being more rude than anybody I've talked to in recent months.  That's not true, Mr. Musil.  And he probably talks to a lot of people.  Just...  Right, I mean, you know, the Game Over, the book, gives a very good description of what  happened up there before this event. 
[01:57:30]  Howl went on for 15 years.  And now that it's going to trial a lot of...  Here we are.  I'm back.  Shh.  Come on, Paul.  God, man.  I'm sorry.  My phone's crapping out.  I'm all over the place.  20 years.  So...  And the culture of silence, the name of the book in itself, means that there has been  a cover-up going on.  Do you just mean Penn State, or is it really all of these schools and sports programs and 
[01:58:00]  these little, almost like fraternities?  Well, it's like a...  It's a cautionary tale, that's for sure, because Penn State is not the only university that sits  out in the middle of nowhere and runs itself and generates a huge amount of money.  The Penn State football program brings $54 million in profit in a year.  Wow.  And it's a situation where they were protecting the brand, and you can go all over the United  States and find other places that would want to protect the brand, because there are 
[01:58:30]  huge amounts of...  You know, if this guy would let me talk, I would manage my answers once.  What do you think about the Syracuse thing?  How about that whole mess up there and whatnot?  What?  The whole Syracuse University.  You know, even if you have a legitimate question, he's not going to want to answer you, because  you keep interrupting the guy when he's talking.  I know.  I got a bad connection.  That's a very legitimate point, how they've seen what's going on over at Penn State, and  these kids are getting paid millions of dollars, and now they're saying that they want to... 
[01:59:00]  That's not true.  That's not true.  What?  Sure.  Everybody's making millions of dollars, and up at Syracuse, they want to make money.  So they say that the guy did a whole bunch of stuff up there, too.  I didn't think so.  Well, I realize you've done a tremendous amount of research on that, so...  Sure, sure.  In the 150 people that we interviewed during the course of this...  Wow.  Yeah.  A lot of people.  The bottom line is that it's a tale that people should read to make sure that they understand 
[01:59:30]  the ramifications of not being, doing the right thing.  Right.  Right.  Tell the truth.  Well, it sounds like a fascinating book of a story that is fascinating.  I mean, people really are all over this, and you've kind of put it together for everybody.  Bill Mushi?  Yep. 
[02:00:00]  Mushi.  Jerry Sandusky, Penn State and the Culture of Silence in bookstores right now, and on Amazon.  Check it out.  And also, you're at B Mushi on Twitter.  I want to know, what do you think is going to happen with this trial?  How much trouble are they going to get into for perjury?  Well, perjury is a statute.  If the government can prove it, they would file it, because they filed two perjury charges  in this case already.  Which ones do the kids are in trouble for perjury? 
[02:00:30]  None of them are.  Well, who's in perjuring all...  What's happening over there?  Actually, nobody really proved any perjury during their testimony that I saw.  Who's perjuring stuff?  Paul.  Enough.  This makes great radio, though.  Well, yeah, certainly.  Great.  Well, you know, I appreciate you calling the show.  It's good to hear you.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Bill, thanks so much for calling in. 
[02:01:00]  I apologize.  I like to listen.  Not you.  I apologize for Mr....  Just remember the name is Game Over.  Yes, Game Over.  Jerry Sandusky, Penn State, and the Culture of Silence.  Then we'll see what happens, righto.  All right, Paul and Bill.  Thank you so much, Bill.  Good luck with the book.  Thank you, man.  Have a second calling.  You're welcome.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Take it easy, man.  Bye.  All right.  That's Bill Mushi.  Yes. 
[02:01:30]  All right, Paul.  Paul Horvius.  Holy shit.  God damn.  He was getting so annoyed when you're just going, ha, yeah, sure, in the background.  He was so annoyed with you.  If you just shut up and let me talk.  Did it seem distracting?  Oh, it was so uncomfortable, man.  In the mid-sentence of his, you go, oh, there you go.  I'm back.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I'm back.  And you're answering his questions. 
[02:02:00]  You're a dick.  Oh, it's looking great.  No problem.  I like to listen.  Yeah, no problem.  I like to listen.  Ha!  All right.  No, not asking you.  Well, you know, why don't we let the people roll that around in their mouth a little.  We'll take a little break and be back in a few.

[02:06:00]  All right.  Thank you.  Good morning, everyone.  I was watching a little television last night.  There was, of course, a Pawn Stars marathon on, which there always is.  I was reading some of your tweets.  I am fascinated with the program, and it's the same program every program.  It's the same thing.  Pawn Stars Rick, the guy that really runs the joint.  There's an old man, the old man, and his son, Big Hoss, and, of course, Chumlee. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  And as I'm watching it, I realize, wow, this guy's fucking everyone that comes into this  thing.  I was like, but they start off like, all right, earlier a guy walked in with, and then say  what the item is, and then he says like, and I had an expert looking at it, and if this  is authentic, this could be huge. 
[02:07:00]  We're talking huge money.  And then they go back to the inside the shop, because he says that in his little fucking  MTV confessional thing.  And then the expert looks, and he's like, well, you know what?  Yeah, this looks right.  I'm looking at the comparison of this.  It's good.  You know, this is, it's absolutely authentic.  All right.  Thank you.  They shake his hand and leaves.  He goes, so what are you looking to do, pawn it or sell it?  He goes, I want to sell it.  Well, how much you want for it?  I'm looking for $20,000. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  I can't do that.  I'm thinking more like 300.  But he just said, if it's authentic, it's going to.  You said it was worth $20,000.  And he goes, yeah, but I mean, I've got to try to sell it for that.  I've got to make some money, and who's going to buy it for $20,000?  In this economy?  Yeah.  You know, I've got a business to run here, and I know this is going to sit in my shop  here for a long time.  Look, the best I could do is $325,000.  Yeah.  I like when he says things like, and he does.  Well, it's, yeah, it's a collectible, it's so rare that no one really wants it. 
[02:08:00]  Wait a minute, what?  It's so rare, no one wants it.  How often do I got guys coming to my store asking for something like this?  Yeah.  Or it's a just miss.  Yeah, you know what?  If it was the year before, or the year after it was made, you'd be talking huge amounts  of money.  Hey, I'd have no qualms of giving you $50,000 for it.  But now, maybe $30 bucks.  He's constantly cramming it. 
[02:08:30]  And the people are just as bad.  I like, it's like, yeah, I'm bringing in a family heirloom, a watch that was with my  father in World War II, or my grandfather in World War II.  My father kept it in his ass in Vietnam and gave it to me.  Uh, I had to kill somebody for it.  And, um, yeah, uh, I'm bringing it in.  I'm hoping to get $5,000 for it.  The least I'll take is probably $3,800.  And they walk out going, you know, $250 bucks. 
[02:09:00]  I didn't have it when I walked in.  You know.  And I have it now.  Oh no.  It's not taking up space in the garage anymore.  And I mean, I didn't have the $250 before I walked in.  And you know, it's good.  I'm going to take my wife out to dinner here in Vegas.  I love these guys that come in with like, you know, it's like something they've had in  their family forever.  They, it's been a collectible.  They want money for it.  They go in, Rick offers them shit for it.  But they take it and you know, in an hour, it's in a fucking blackjack dealers stack. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  It's just over.  You think they wasted the money?  Yes.  And then they feel like shit for selling like something that they, they had for years.  If they're just smart enough to list it on eBay themselves.  They want it immediately.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  They want that money immediately.  And they say it too.  They go, yeah, I'll give, yeah, I'll give you $400.  That's cash money right now.  Cash money right now.  In your hand.  And the expert will be like, there's, what can I say?  What can I say?  There's just no market for gold bars.  That's a meme with fucking Rick. 
[02:10:00]  It's just no.  It's just no market for gold bars.  You know, it's gold.  It's gotta be melted.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's always gonna wear this on a necklace.  Yeah.  You know, gold.  It was big in the days of like the Incas.  But now.  And you can feel the weight on this.  Feel how heavy this is.  Yeah.  I mean, you're not gonna want to carry this around.  You don't want to carry it around.  It's just gonna take up room in my shop.  You think he's trying to just fucking scam people out of their stuff?  He's constantly fucking people and I can't get enough of it.  I watch it all the time. 
[02:10:30]  Kenny.  Did you see the gun?  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Why would Sam pay attention?  Oh, yeah.  He really wasn't, right?  Yeah.  He didn't care that I stepped up to a microphone.  I know.  I still don't.  Fucking respected man over here.  Did you see the episode with the Gatling gun?  Uh, yes, I did.  Would you purchase that for $325,000?  $325,000 is a lot of fucking money.  A Gatling gun?  Not to you.  Uh, no.  Well, not to an ordinary person.  Who had a Gatling gun?  But, uh, some guy wheels it up.  It's fucking, uh, it's Las Vegas, Nevada, so they're able to just sell guns. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  And just like, fucking here, take it.  Is that rare, a Gatling gun?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's an old, like, Civil War weapon.  One of the originals.  You ever see one?  It's got a crank on the side.  It's got like six or eight barrels, uh, in it, and the barrels spin around and around,  and it, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, it fires bolts.  It's like the first machine gun.  Oh, wow.  Ever made.  Do we have a picture of that, Dan?  Uh, they used to, they used to mow down people in the Civil War with that motherfucker.  And cannons.  People coming with cannons.  And, uh, they sell them. 
[02:11:30]  An original Gatling gun is worth $300,000?  Uh, I guess this guy wanted it.  I don't know if, did he get it?  Do you remember, Kenny?  Did you watch the whole thing?  They offered, like, $200,000.  Oh.  They never, I've noticed with the big, big, big money items, they never buy them.  Yeah.  Wow.  They're like, you know, I want $300,000.  Yeah, I'll give you $200,000.  Knowing the guy's gonna say no makes him seem like they're giving a lot of money.  I think Chumley gets in hot water tonight.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  What, does he make an offer for something?  I don't know. 
[02:12:00]  That was a teaser commercial for tonight's show.  Oh, boy.  Enough with Chumley.  He always finds his way into trouble.  Oh, doesn't he?  No matter where he starts, that's where he ends up every time.  It's crazy.  I don't know who Chumley is.  Chumley's the little fat, dumb guy on the show.  Oh.  He's the comic relief.  Oh, he's looking in at Iraq.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He's the comic relief.  And then there's the curmudgeonly old father who just talks about being in the Navy a lot  and just, and he's even worse than Rick with giving people something. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, here, I want to sell this.  It's the Holy Grail.  It's the actual cup Jesus Christ drank out of.  And I'd like like $600 billion for it.  Ain't gonna happen.  I know people that have sold these and they're going right now for maybe $75.  Like, what the fuck?  What?  I guess I'd give it to you.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't have to cart at home.  And then he's outside with the interview.  Yeah, you know, I wanted more for it, but it is in essence just a cup. 
[02:13:00]  My favorite.  It's not even that good.  Is that what Jesus drank out of the Holy Grail?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's supposed to give you immortality.  What about the Detroit show?  The Detroit show.  You ever watch that?  That is a hardcore pawn.  That one's the worst because it's so fake.  Which is fake.  I was talking to Anthony.  Yes.  I was talking to you.  We're having a conversation amongst everybody.  If you're not happy about that.  You think it's an AMD conversation?  Jumping on you.  I like that.  The hardcore pawn is so fake.  You see, it's supposed to be in Detroit, right? 
[02:13:30]  It's in Detroit.  And it's a bunch of black people that come in.  And they're trying to sell like old Sega gaming systems.  And they want $200 for it.  And they wind up getting in arguing matches with the people at the store.  And they walk out all angry and cursing.  But when they turn around to walk out, you see the wireless mic unit clipped on their back.  Yeah.  Like they are so angry and so in the moment, yet they kind of remember to get their mic off.  And they're ready to kill them, but they don't smash the mic.  No, of course not.  It's so fake. 
[02:14:00]  Is it?  I like how, just because it's pawn, they try to fit the, you know, hardcore pawn.  Oh, porn!  It's the same joke that Pawn Stars made.  Oh, that's what it is.  It's Pawn Stars, but it's supposed to be Porn Stars.  I want to do one where it's just all toys and games and stuff.  She called it Kitty Porn.  Thank you.  Why didn't you beat him to that?  I knew he was going to do that.  That's a good one.  They called it Kitty Porn.  Do you like the Storage Wars?  Storage Wars is another one that I think is completely fake. 
[02:14:30]  Yep.  It's like, oh, here's a, yep!  Yep!  Yep!  Yep!  Because they open up the door, they look in, there's like a rolled up old shag carpet,  a ripped leather couch, and an old chandelier or something.  And as they're going through it, it's like, oh, hey, look at this!  It's a fucking Revolutionary War perfect mint condition musket.  Oh, how'd that happen?  That's the wow factor.  The wow factor, they call it. 
[02:15:00]  And then they always know a place to go.  There's a collector or something where they go, and the guy tells them,  How much did you pay for that unit?  I paid like $45 for the whole unit.  Well, you got something here that's worth about $50,000.  What?  Well, and then they just bought for $45.  And then the price, $50,000.  No one gave it to them.  It's just some guy going, I think that's worth it.  There's like an old coffee mug in there.  That coffee mug's got to be $4,000.  Bing, $4,000. 
[02:15:30]  But they always go with the high price.  If they say it's worth like $1,000 or $2,000, they always go with the high price.  $2,000, right.  Even though you're not going to get that on the open market.  No.  There's that one weird old guy who slicks his hair back like the old greaser  who's always got some young boy with him to help clean out his storage bin.  And he just collects things.  He doesn't actually have a store.  That's, yeah, with Pawn Stars, he does that too.  They get a price on something.  The expert goes, this could bring probably anywhere between $12,000 and $15,000. 
[02:16:00]  And they go, okay, what do you want for it?  And the guy goes, $15,000.  Well, that's the high end, that's the price he gave, and that's retail.  We don't do retail here.  That's the price that I'm going to have to get for it.  Look, I'll give you $800.  Wait a minute, what happened?  Do you like the handwriting expert?  That guy that gets the magnifying glass out and verifies.  So all he's got is a big briefcase filled with a magnifying glass.  One magnifying glass.  He looks and goes, well, I kind of know his signature goes up at the end. 
[02:16:30]  And he does dot his I.  Yeah.  And I'd say this is authentic.  And then they have the Amish guy from the museum.  The museum.  What is it?  Clark County Museum.  Clark County Museum.  He comes in, but he never gives a price.  No, no.  He will not tell them a price.  He'll tell you if it's authentic or not, but he won't tell them how much it's worth.  What are you looking to do?  Pawn it or sell it?  Looking to sell it?  How much you want for it?  And then he says it, and they always go, well, that ain't going to happen. 
[02:17:00]  That's not going to happen.  That ain't going to happen.  American dollars?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that ain't going to.  We're not even close, the old man.  We're not even close on this one.  Does Chumley always get into hot water?  Oh, God.  Chumley will be behind the counter, and he's like,  how much you want for it?  And then the guy will say, and Chumley's like,  all right, that sounds good.  And they're like, no, no, no.  It's like if it wasn't for bad luck, Chumley wouldn't have no luck at all.  Oh, no luck at all.  And they make him try out some of the wacky things people bring in. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  They make him put on the wacky costumes.  Like if they want to find out if the gun is going to blow up when you fire it,  hey, Chumley, why don't you go fire it?  That's right.  So Chumley's the comic relief.  Chumley, he's so crazy.  He does from time to time.  He's so crazy.  Those hijinks he gets into.  He always finds himself in some kind of a jam.  Well, he's in hot water all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys are missing out.  You're not watching Final Offer.  Final Offer.  Yeah, this is the new How Much Is My Shit Worth show. 
[02:18:00]  And what is this?  How does this show work?  You bring those four guys and they are buyers or they're traders or dealers, let's call them.  And you bring your shit and you get to go into each room and each room has one of the dealers.  And each dealer will give you an offer.  Now, if you leave that offer, you cannot go back to it.  So you might have given up the best offer, but you won't know until you go through all the guys.  Oh, so if you get greedy and think you're going to get something better.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So then you can get fucked.  And then at the end, everybody gets into the same room and it's like, well, all right, who bought it? 
[02:18:30]  How much did they buy it for?  And then someone will go, oh, I would have paid you like another 20 grand.  And then the guy who brought the item in is like, oh, fuck, I could have had 20 grand.  Seems too complicated.  It's not.  It's a good show.  You got to watch it.  They brought in the Energizer Bunny.  When the fuck?  Have you seen that on television?  I like storage doors because they just go, yep.  And then they get a storage locker and then some weird stuff is in it.  Yep.  Yeah, but they have weird stuff on final offer and then all the dealers get to fight over it.  They got details on final offers. 
[02:19:00]  None of these other shows have any details.  No.  Nice mindless.  Yeah.  You don't want details?  Nope.  No, no, no.  Chumlee can't handle any details.  I don't care about that.  Does Chumlee make a mess out of everything?  Everything.  It's like, oh, we're trying to make a profit here, but Chumlee is just offering way too much money for things.  You know what else?  You can tell that Pawn Stars is a legitimate kind of thing.  Like, they do bring things in.  I think they're trying to rob everyone blind.  Sure.  But, hey, he is running a business here.  But then Pawn, Hardcore Pawn is like, you know, where Pawn Stars has something that Washington signed. 
[02:19:30]  President Washington signed this.  I got to get my hands on this.  How much does that cost?  This is something I really want.  Well, if he buys it, it's like 200 bucks.  Probably at auction would go for 800,000.  Well, that's an auction.  Yeah, yeah, that's an auction.  They're going to take 30% right off the top.  If you want to go to an auction, you could try to auction this off.  Yeah, but you're going to get fucked.  Nobody knows where an auction house is.  Yeah, it's like, I don't know what's an auction.  They take 30%?  Yeah, apparently.  Well, that's what they tell them. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, oh, well, you know.  We'll give you cash right now.  $100 bills.  Casino's right the fuck there.  What, are you going to wait for an auction?  You've got gambling to do.  Oh, they fuck them good.  Do you think people sell anything just to gamble?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  And then hardcore porn.  There's people that come in with, like I said, old Sega system games.  I want $200 for this shit, motherfucker.  Watch your language in my shop.  Every episode, there's three to four incidents where their big security guards have to come out. 
[02:20:30]  Has to come over.  And drag someone outside.  They always start the fight for the big black guy to drag the guy outside.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they start yelling at the fucking guy that runs the joint.  He's like, yeah, yeah, fuck you.  I like it.  One time he goes, hey, this is a shop.  I run things professionally.  And then two minutes later, he's yelling, fuck you, at somebody.  It's like, really?  Is that running your shop professionally?  I don't remember Rick ever leaning over the counter going, hey, fuck you.  Take your fucking Colt 45 with you.  At Pawn Stars, they don't do that. 
[02:21:00]  No, no.  They do seem like a more respectable...  Where's that based out of?  Vegas.  And so is the other one?  And the other one's in Detroit.  Yeah, they do.  So the Detroit one, yeah, it's right off 8 Mile and shit.  That's the classiest one.  The dregs of society come in and want to sell everything that I guess is stolen.  Meanwhile, they wouldn't be able to do that.  It's so fake.  It's so fucking fake.  I get stuck on those marathons, though.  It's just like I've watched probably eight to ten episodes in a row.  Yeah, I'll watch 150 episodes of Storage Wars. 
[02:21:30]  I could watch that all day.  It stinks, dude.  It does.  I'll stay up all night watching Storage Wars.  It's horrible, mindless programming.  It's garbage.  I can't stand that.  I want to buy it.  We're watching these assholes to see if they buy people's storage units?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stinks.  Well, you know what?  Sam likes to jerk off to the girl in Storage Wars.  Oh, wow.  Jeez, Kenny.  Yeah, I've never tried jerking off to the girl in Storage Wars.  Tell the truth.  I just did.  Who, the wife of that couple, and they're always fucking up, and they always buy the wrong shit. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, they buy the wrong locker.  Fucking impulsively buying $2,000 lockers with a mattress inside of it.  She's always disappointed in him, like, oh, I told you not to spend that much on this.  And what are they, all run thrift shops or something?  Yeah, that's it.  It's like thrift shops.  They get these storage lockers, put shit in their thrift stores, so people can just rummage through it and buy something for a nickel.  I hate thrift stores.  I fucking hate a thrift store.  I wouldn't buy a storage unit unless there was a limo in it.  Hester Moffitt. 
[02:22:30]  Hester Moffitt.  You can't cut the lock off.  You've got to use a tire jack and try to squeeze under it.  See, because that's what she did.  There's a caller there, a phone screener, writes, the auctioneer on Storage Wars.  Okay.  Let's talk to him.  Let's talk to the auctioneer.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Walt!  Walt!  Walt!  Walt!  Walt!  Walt!  Walt!  Yeah!  All right.  You get it.  Those guys, the auctioneer, I had a storage unit over at this place. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  By LAX.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Now, the same day I was in there paying my past due amount, they were auctioning storage  units.  Uh-huh.  But there's not going to be any cameras there because this was kind of like in the hood,  but it's more civilized than what they show on television.  Oh, really?  Now, are you a storage unit?  Are you an auctioneer?  I'm not an auctioneer.  I had a storage unit. 
[02:23:30]  He had to pay off his storage unit, but he's saying he saw an auction that wasn't.  But not only is he not the auctioneer from Storage Wars.  Yeah.  He's not an auctioneer, and he's never been on Storage Wars.  So what it says, the auctioneer on Storage Wars.  Period.  Who's the dummy that wrote this?  Okay, the auctioneer on Storage Wars was the auctioneer at my storage spot.  I didn't read this wrong, did I?  That says, that's a period.  Could you highlight the whole thing so we could see what everything says? 
[02:24:00]  It says, the auctioneer on Storage Wars, period.  They auctioned off my unit the same day I paid it.  It sounds like the auctioneer on Storage Wars is talking about his storage unit.  His unit.  And they auctioned off the same day I paid it.  That is nothing like what this guy is saying.  Couldn't be less.  This guy says he was paying off his unit, and they were auctioning off another unit,  and he saw that activity, and it did not resemble what they show on television.  Who's screening the calls?  But that's not what I'm saying.  Oh, boy. 
[02:24:30]  Shh.  Oh, boy.  Shh.  What's up?  What happened?  Oh, boy.  Jim!  Shh!  And this, this, my friend, this is why I just don't take the calls.  We made it, we took a chance, and it really...  Well, I want to hear what this guy is saying.  What happened, dude?  Okay, go ahead.  Okay.  Shh.  Shh.  Right.  Right.  Doing the auctioneer.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Did you bid against yourself?  I paid my unit.  Oh.  If I could take the unit up for... 
[02:25:00]  What's in your unit, sir?  What's in it?  Well...  Unit?  What are you in the army or something?  Good one, Chip.  I know.  You really want to...  How big was your storage unit?  You could have said how big was your unit.  My storage unit?  That would have been a joke.  Yeah.  What's...  No.  What do you have that's so important that you need to pay rent on a box and put stuff in  it?  Go.  Okay.  Here's what was in my storage unit.  Oh, good.  Pictures, signed autographs, and mementos of my... 
[02:25:30]  What autographs?  And what mementos?  Mementos.  Is your storage unit climate-controlled?  It's not climate-controlled.  And I'm talking about mementos and whatnot of my artist, Etta James.  No.  What kind of autographs?  Group management.  Etta James, he said.  Yeah.  How many Etta James autographs you got?  I have several.  I don't have just her autographs.  I...  I hate the word several.  Just get her to sign one thing and leave her alone. 
[02:26:00]  She can't.  She's dead.  Sounds like seven, but it must be fake.  What else do you have?  I had that.  I had a...  I had a bike.  How long have you had it?  Motorcycle and...  No.  How many autographs did you have from Etta James?  Oh, man.  The Etta James Society in the World According to Garp?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I used to be Etta James manager up until the time of 2005, until her passing.  What did she do?  She's a singer, right? 
[02:26:30]  She was a singer?  Etta James was a singer?  Wow.  What?  This guy.  She's talking when he's not supposed to.  He's not when he's supposed to.  Yes, sir.  You're a terrible caller.  Who was screening the call?  Yeah, what do you have signed by Etta James?  Talking at the same time, asking a different question.  Okay, go ahead.  Yep.  I love making...  Yep.  What do you got signed by Etta James?  Yep.  I got everything.  How much did you pay for the unit? 
[02:27:00]  How much did you pay for the unit?  How long did you manage her for?  You managed her?  You have pictures of her?  Did you see the guy who says, yep?  Was it the same auctioneer from the show?  Aren't you the auctioneer?  How much did you get?  It is why.  Was the yep guy there?  Did you have a lot of stuff you didn't want to sell?  So you bought it for your store?  Were they going to auction off your storage thing if you didn't pay for it?  How much for the Etta James autograph collection?  If you're not the yep guy, do you have your own hats?  And do you have something you say when you're buying something at auction? 
[02:27:30]  For a auction, they're not going to do it.  Who's not going to?  Etta James?  What are they not going to do?  What is she not going to do?  Put it Etta James to him.  Why wouldn't she sign it?  She's dead.  No, no, no.  Sir, you have to explain better.  The guys on Storage Wars don't come over to you.  Sir, sir, start over.  So you're the guy on Storage Wars.  Right.  You manage Etta James, and she wouldn't sign what?  Something for the guy from Storage Wars. 
[02:28:00]  Really?  This is more comical than anything else.  That's great.  Sucking some people with these goddamn memes.  How much was your...  How much was your locker worth at the end of the day once you got it priced out?  Well, they didn't sell my unit because I paid for it.  But my unit was the next unit up for auction.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got auctioned it off.  How much you paid for it, your unit? 
[02:28:30]  How much I paid for it?  Why were you delinquent in the first place?  Because I was on tour.  On tour?  With Etta James?  Yeah, I was on tour.  So if you're already on tour with her, why don't you just get her to sign some more shit?  Yeah.  How many tours have you done?  How many tours have I done?  That's what he asked.  Five up until 2011.  What's her best book?  Book. 
[02:29:00]  Thank you.  What?  That's the name of the book?  Sir?  You never know who's listening.  What's her best movie?  Her best movie?  No, book.  You ever seen her naked?  What's her best book?  I heard she had a big clitoris.  Is that true?  Did Etta have a giant clit?  Yeah.  Now we're just getting into disrespect.  You're right. 
[02:29:30]  That is disrespectful.  Apologize.  Well, you're the one with the pictures.  Is Etta propped up in your storage locker?  Sick fuck.  Is her head in formaldehyde?  Just out of line, dude.  What?  Did she have a moth?  What'd you say?  Yeah.  I said humor is fine.  Right.  Good, good, good, good, good.  This type of stuff is uncalled for.  I agree.  Put her meat curtains on a meat slicer.  Slice them off.  Put them between your lips and go, frrrt, frrrt. 
[02:30:00]  I mean, come on now.  It's exactly right.  Yeah, come on.  So you're an auctioneer.  That's what James are talking about.  You're an auctioneer.  You're an auctioneer.  At the Etta James storage facility.  Yes.  They were selling your locker.  You bid on it.  She was there once.  Made some money.  She had a storage unit full of dildos.  Right.  The Liz Taylor storage unit.  That's what I was talking about.  You had a...  What was in that?  And everything extra you were able to store in Etta James' ass.  She was a large woman.  Because it was big.  She loved taking dick in her asshole.  Is that true, sir? 
[02:30:30]  That's just disrespectful.  I did hear she put a bed knob up there one time.  Yeah?  Like Joey Buttlicker?  Is it Etta Buttlicker?  Joey Buttlicker, indeed.  Etta Buttlicker.  Joey Buttlicker.  What did Etta James do?  She was a singer.  I thought she wrote books.  I don't know.  I know the name.  What did she do, sir?  Yeah, what did she do?  I know her name, but I don't know her work.  We're just talking out of ignorance.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  What'd she do?  She took a lot of dick.  What'd she do, sir? 
[02:31:00]  Wow.  What did Etta do?  Talk to us on the phone.  Don't listen to the radio.  Yeah, what do you do on tour?  I just can't believe you guys are doing that one.  It's terrible.  You're right.  You're right.  I agree.  I deeply apologize.  Why are you avoiding the question?  What do you do on tour?  Book tour?  Tour of duty?  Duty.  Duty.  What did Etta do?  She did a lot.  What?  She did a lot.  Oh. 
[02:31:30]  Why did everyone think she was dead?  We've been wrong from the start.  She's dead.  Sorry.  You said she passed.  He said she did a lot.  Oh.  Oh.  I thought you said she's still alive.  No, no, no, no.  She passed away in general.  Still alive.  She's dead.  What did she do?  Tell me.  She died.  That's for sure.  I'm not familiar with her work.  Yeah, you are.  Okay.  Well, just say that.  We did.  Because it was just bad.  It was just I was fucking, you know, going off like a shock jock.  I was being crazy and wild. 
[02:32:00]  Did you like it?  No.  Isn't it great?  I'm sorry, then.  Where are you calling from?  There's some ice air.  Maybe it's just not your cup of Etta cum.  Maybe two sausage muffins and a sausage biscuit.  That's what was in the storage locker?  Why would you care?  Hello.  Huh?  Why would I care?  Because I care.  About two egg McMuffins in a storage locker?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Listen to me.  You guys, I've got to order something to eat, man.  Yeah, have some muffins or something.  Yeah.  So Etta James was a singer.  She passed away.  She was 74 years old.  That's correct.  She was that old?  Yeah, she lived a good full life.  Well, Chip, you know about Etta James?  Yes, I do.  My mother liked her very much.  She would always say,  Chipper, now this is a lady.  Oh, that's nice.  Did the gentleman that used to come over your house  to hang out with your mother,  did they like Etta James?  They did. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah?  No.  Let me see a picture of Etta James.  Let's see what she looks like.  She was an older woman.  She passed on.  We're popping up the website right now.  Oh, my goodness.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  She looks familiar.  Sort of.  Those mementos that I had.  She liked Egg McMuffins?  What mementos do you have?  What did you have?  Yeah, she liked candy.  Mentos.  Mentos.  No, it's mementos.  Well, no, he had some stuff from Etta James, 
[02:33:30]  which is kind of cool.  What did you have of hers?  Man, posters, handbills.  You looking to pawn them or sell them?  I'll give you 30 bucks.  Handbills?  Was she a duck or something?  They only mean 30 bucks.  How much did a hand get charged?  For TV.  You just don't see a lot of people coming in here  looking for Etta James mementos.  You know, I've got to frame them.  I'm going to have to hang them on the wall,  and I don't know how long they're going to be there. 
[02:34:00]  How many Etta James fans are there, really?  This is going to take me.  And I have to pay rent.  I've got overhead.  How much do you want for it?  $300,000.  What?  I'll be right back.  I'll give you $100.  $100?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Go take a dump.  It's worth at least $200,000.  Oh, it's easy.  Yeah, same.  This guy watches the show, too.  What was your favorite book that she wrote?  What?  She didn't write a book.  She's a singer, right?  And Hanne Lippowitz wrote the book.  What do you do now that your meal ticket's dead? 
[02:34:30]  Well, I don't have a dead meal ticket.  Yes, you do.  Etta James.  You're just talking about her.  So what do you do for work now?  I still tour manage.  You're a tour manager?  I'm still a tour manager.  For her?  She's not selling shit.  She's not touring anymore?  Well, other people are touring.  Okay, now tell me who you tour with.  I'm not going to tell you that one because then you'll start more confusion and conflict. 
[02:35:00]  No one listens to this.  Don't worry.  Yeah, why would you plug your artist?  Yeah, go ahead.  Plug your artist.  Plug my artist?  Yeah.  I'm doing a little indie band.  Yeah?  500?  Who is it?  It's a little small indie band.  It's called Collusion.  Collusion?  Yeah.  Oh, I've heard...  Nobody's heard of them.  No.  They're way less famous than Etta James.  Yeah.  Look, I would love to stay on the phone with you for a lot longer. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  You should try to be the auctioneer on Storage Wars.  Yeah, like the screener wants you to be.  Yeah, there you go.  Holy mackerel.  Unbelievable.  All right, thank you, Walt, from Texas, who was nothing like was described in the description  of the call.  Thanks, sir.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, he's a terrible auctioneer.  He's not very good at that.  He's terrible at it.  For being the auctioneer on Storage Wars, you'd think they would have gotten a better one. 
[02:36:00]  Maybe he doesn't translate over the phone.  They got, like, Cajun porn stars, too.  Porn stars?  Porn stars.  It's Cajun porn stars.  Yeah, it's not good.  It seems much more fake.  Now they got a Cajun cop show.  I was flipping through the channels.  Oh, you mean the bounty hunter?  No, like Cajun.  There's, like, a sheriff's department down there.  I need real reality.  I don't like any of this bullshit.  All those towing shows can suck fucking Joey Buttlicker's bed knob. 
[02:36:30]  It's not reality.  It's actuality.  Yeah, exactly.  Those towing shows are so bad.  There's explosions.  There's fucking gunfire.  Cars are blowing up.  And it never makes the news.  It's like wrestling.  You can't watch anything on True TV.  No.  True TV is fake.  It's the worst channel.  We've finally reached what 1984 was supposed to be.  Do you like Bait Car?  Bait Car is fake, too.  I don't like that.  I think it's totally fake.  I don't know. 
[02:37:00]  I don't know.  Some of them seem like they're, you know, oh, shit.  Oh, open the door, motherfucker.  You know, some of them seem legit, but they're not really tracking them in the truck.  Beep, beep.  They're watching all that shit.  I can't stand those fucking shows.  You just got to try to watch without intellectualizing it and just pretend it's real.  I know.  I can't, though.  Knowing it's fake, I can't fucking watch it.  I just can't.  Yeah.  I don't like any of those fucking fake-ass shows.  There's drama.  You know what? 
[02:37:30]  Something tells me, if you're running a fucking cupcake store, there's not much drama on a daily basis.  People aren't yelling like it's a life-or-death situation over what sprinkles are going on a chocolate fucking cupcake.  Go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let me tell you something.  If you can't fucking cut it in this kitchen, you're out.  These are cupcakes.  What?  What are you talking about?  Just go make cupcakes somewhere else.  Oh, it's the worst.  We're trying to figure out how to fit fireworks in this cake without melting it. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I don't like any of those shows.  Real shit is great.  I watch the shit out of prison and murder shows.  I was watching a show yesterday on Kids That Murder.  It's fantastic.  You see that one?  Yeah, it's great.  ID is just one of the best channels.  Between the 48 Hours Mysteries and the killer, what is it?  Deadly Women.  Yeah, Deadly Women.  Killer Kids.  I love that shit.  And I Almost Got Away With It is one of my favorites. 
[02:38:30]  I Almost Got Away With It is great.  And then there was that other one.  I Almost Got Away With It.  Oh, Locked Up Abroad is good.  That's on another channel.  That's on, what, MSNBC or some shit?  Well, there's Lock Up is on MSNBC.  Oh, Lock Up is.  Yeah, yeah.  And Lock Up Abroad.  Locked Up Abroad.  But Locked Up Abroad is on, I think it's on ID.  We're on those channels.  It's fantastic.  Lock Up is good, too, though, on MSNBC.  Oh, yeah.  They're just in prison.  It just reinforces your whole idea that you really don't want to be there.  It's terrifying. 
[02:39:00]  This prison is a horrible place.  It should just be called You Don't Want to Be Raped.  Yeah.  It's like the rape show.  And so is that I Survived show.  You watch I Survived?  I've seen it a couple times.  I don't watch it regularly.  But that is also like...  Whenever women are on there, it should just be the I Was Raped show.  Yeah.  It's I Survived a Rape.  All those shows are just like, they enforce the fact that everywhere you go, you need to  have a plan.  It's very dangerous.  You need to have a plan.  I Survived because it just wasn't my time to go. 
[02:39:30]  Nah.  No.  I think it was your time.  You just got fucking lucky, didn't you?  Yeah.  You kind of skirted out of that one because the guy didn't shoot you in the right part  of your head.  You gotta always have a plan.  Oh, you gotta have a plan.  That show is scary, though, because when women, they get abducted, or they're at home  and there's a home invasion, or there's always something, or they have an accident and they're  trying to get help.  It's always...  And then I heard a zipper pull down. 
[02:40:00]  Let's see.  Again, it's the Rapity Rape show.  Always raped.  Rape, Rapity Rape show.  Guys love...  Why do guys love to rape so much?  I don't know, but it seems like even if they're there for robbery, they're gonna  fucking bite off a piece.  Squeeze a rape in, yeah.  You're gonna bite a little piece of rape off.  Rape is so much worse than being robbed.  Take me to the ATM.  Oh, by the way, other ATM.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Ass to mouth.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  Bedknob to mouth.  Lick the bedknob. 
[02:40:30]  Lick that bedknob from Joey.  Licker.  And then I almost got away with it.  It's kind of cool when there's a clever bank robbery guy or an art thief.  Something classy.  It's a little creepy when it's a fucking murderer.  And they're interviewing him, and he's kind of laughing like, well, then the police was  trying to get me, but hey, hey, hey, I came out the bank.  It's like he's a killer.  Yeah.  We're kind of putting him in a situation where he's getting that publicity that he kind of  wanted.  I like the robberies and stuff, because I like capers. 
[02:41:00]  I like a good caper.  But I want them to get away with it.  As long as it's one of those clever movie capers.  Like Ocean's 13 or something.  Exactly.  Love the oceans.  You know, you could always just kill the guard and take some shit, but that's...  No.  I like a good caper.  Something that involves a stethoscope.  Yeah.  And cables.  And nobody gets killed, but somebody gets frustrated because all their money's gone.  Yeah, they walk in hours after everyone's already gone.  Yeah.  And look at empty safe deposit boxes and go like, oh, boom. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Right on.  There's a big hole in the roof.  And then somewhere, like five guys, you're just walking around with all this money and  nobody knows who they are because they're peeling off their fake noses and stuff.  Fake noses, yeah.  Yeah.  Any caper with a fake nose.  Great.  Great caper.  Yeah.  All right.  I've got a couple of stories I wanted to...  Stories?  I wanted to get to here.  I want to wait for Jim for that one.  He really enjoyed that one.  He's been gone for a long time.  And this one.  He's taking a shit.  He's taking a big shit.  I guess so. 
[02:42:00]  He's...  What do they call that?  Dropping Rodney King off at the pool.  No.  I think that...  What?  No?  No.  I thought that was a new saying.  Too soon.  Everyone's using.  Too soon.  Oh.  Jeez.  They will.  They will.  No.  I got two stories I got to say for Jimmy, though.  It's the guy that punched the dog in the face.  Hilarious.  And the squid that the woman ate.  Yes.  I like that story.  This one, though, I don't think he really gives a shit about.  Jenny McCarthy? 
[02:42:30]  Mm-hmm.  What happened?  Dentist got quite a surprise recently.  You know Jenny McCarthy.  Everybody does.  The former Playboy, a playmate, accidentally sent a naked picture of herself to her son's  dentist while the 10-year-old woke up with an abscess in his mouth.  So I guess she was texting him about that and inadvertently texted a naked picture of herself.  How do you do that?  Are you supposed to text your dentist?  Yeah, that seems a little weird. 
[02:43:00]  The dentist was like Jenny McCarthy comes in and the dentist just goes, yeah, I text all  my patients.  What's your number?  Yeah, what's your number?  Text me.  Yeah.  If there's a problem, like if his tooth abscesses, you give me a text.  Here's my number.  And then meanwhile he grinds some dirt into the kid's fucking open wound in his mouth,  creating said abscess.  So it's horrific to remember, Jenny McCarthy explained on Wendy Williams.  So I'm taking a picture of it and I'm sending it to the dentist. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, she went to take a picture of the abscess in her son's mouth and she sent him a nude  picture by accident.  The dentist, like 80 years old, literally screamed.  Uh, she screamed at the top of her lungs.  The sexy photo was saved for her boyfriend, Chicago Bears linebacker, uh, Brian, uh, you're a law hacker.  Hmm.  Yes, boyfriend, oh, well.  Huh, that's interesting.  But, uh, I thought there was more to that story. 
[02:44:00]  I thought it was like a scandal.  That's just like a fun story she presented it as.  But now Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend's phones are going to be stolen for sure because  now everybody knows there's nude pictures on them.  Nudes.  And I still think that it's creepy that this dentist wanted Jenny McCarthy.  You call the office and then the secretary makes an appointment.  Yeah.  You would never, you don't text any dentist.  Yeah, that is odd that she texted the dentist and sent him a nude and that he's 80 years old.  I think she's just trying to, like, oh, look how wild I am. 
[02:44:30]  Oopsie.  Yeah, but Sam, what if she said, well, here's my number, so call me maybe.  Oh, God.  Carly Rae Jepsen's song.  Ugh.  Broken by, of course.  You guys.  Sam Robertson after opening a theme live.  Oh, yeah.  It's on Troy Kwan's latest mixtape also.  Well, Troy Kwan knows what the kids are listening to.  Bonkers on bath salts.  We get to see, we get to see a lot of naked celebrities these days.  You didn't used to. 
[02:45:00]  Like, you used to scour, like, Playboy.  Sometimes Playboy would do, like, or Penthouse would do the girls of Hollywood and they'd show,  like, these still frames of nudes from celebrities.  But they were very fuzzy and you couldn't really see.  And sometimes they were just, like, in bra and panties.  But now it's like you could really dig up nudes of everybody.  In Google Images.  Yeah.  Just in Google Images.  Like before, like when Pam Anderson did Playboy or something.  It was a big deal.  Everybody would buy that magazine.  Yeah.  Now it's like, there it is. 
[02:45:30]  See?  Boom.  All right.  Who's next?  Naked.  Naked.  Naked.  You know who just recently did a movie, Nude, with a big hairy fucking bush?  Ooh.  Sarah Silverman.  Is that right?  She's in a movie where she's taking a shower.  And she's taking a shower with fucking, what's her name?  She just did that Marilyn Monroe movie.  From Dawson's Creek.  Yes.  A little pixie haircut.  Michelle Williams.  Michelle Williams.  Dude, yeah.  Blow that up.  Blow that one up.  That's, yeah.  Michelle Williams.  That's Sarah Silverman naked. 
[02:46:00]  Whoa.  She has a horrible body.  I didn't think, I didn't think it was that horrible.  Yeah, there's no, there's nothing curved about it.  No, she's like a block.  She's square, but she's got the thigh saddlebags.  She's got the middle saddlebag right under her pussy, where her thighs actually meet under there.  She has very tubular titties.  Yeah.  What happened?  And a big hairy bush.  I don't know what happened. 
[02:46:30]  That's her too, right there?  Oh boy.  You know what?  I remember this picture.  Oh, oh.  Oh, yeah.  That's her in a bikini or something.  I don't know.  It's just very odd.  Michelle Williams.  Try to find her, because she was in the same shower scene.  And they're along with some disaster.  What movie is this?  What's this movie called?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  First person that gets it on Paltalk gets their name announced.  Ooh.  Um, anyone?  Anyone?  No, it's not called Cunt Lips. 
[02:47:00]  Not Jews in the Shower.  No.  It's called Take This Waltz.  Announced E-Rock.  E-Rock.  It's E-Rock.  Yay.  There's Michelle Williams.  She's had a baby.  Another one, though.  Big hair.  Is this a period piece?  Not that I see blood dripping down their legs.  Period.  But I think this is maybe a movie that's supposed to be, take place in the 70s.  You haven't actually seen the movie?  You've just seen the stills?  No, I've just seen the stills.  I actually saw the video clip of the movie.  That's Sarah Silverman all the way to the right. 
[02:47:30]  Totally naked with a big hairy bush.  Is that really Sarah?  Yes.  You want to see a better one?  Yeah.  Let me see.  All right.  That's Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back.  Dude, that was a fucking nine logger.  Was it?  Yeah.  Was this before stand-up or no?  No, this is new.  Yummy.  Ah.  She has nice thighs.  I like the fact that her thighs are kind of juicy. 
[02:48:00]  You like that?  I don't like the fact that she's square.  Her pelvis is square.  She's like a Lego.  She has nice tits, though.  You like those?  Yeah.  Her pelvis looks like it's upside down.  Yeah, there's something weird going on there.  She has a very wide, like, rib cage, too, or something.  And her boobs, I don't know.  She's got a very distorted, weird kind of body.  It's not like she's fat. 
[02:48:30]  No, not at all.  Or, I don't know what to make of it.  It's just oddly shit.  This reminds me of when Alanis Morissette got naked.  Right.  What is this from?  Yeah, it is some kind of...  A new movie.  Oh, this is new.  First person that gets it up on Pal Talk.  I'll announce your name.  It's called Take This Waltz.  Ah.  E-Rock.  It's not the last waltz, you dummy.  Let me see more Sarah naked.  Oh, you like that?  Please do.  Take This Bush?  No.  No. 
[02:49:00]  Jimmy Kimmel was banging her when she was, like, you know, a few years back.  So, I see nothing, no problem with that.  Those are all her?  Oh, those are, like, yeah, yeah, motion.  She doesn't look quite as bad with her arms down.  No, with her arms down, she looks much better.  Yeah.  A lot of naked pictures of her on the internet now.  Whoa!  That isn't her, right?  No.  Jesus, that's crazy.  I wonder what possessed her to say,  I'm going to have a big Harry Bush in a movie and show it.  They might have to for movies.  You think it's, what do you mean?  Like, you can't just show bare pussy lips. 
[02:49:30]  That's an interesting statement you're making here.  Almost using the pussy hair as a sensor device to cut out,  so you don't see raw pussy lips.  Right, that's not as dirty.  Are you kidding me?  No.  That can't be true.  I've a lot of times been involved with movies,  and I'm like, you know, I want to see some puss.  That's what you're looking for?  That can't be.  Wow.  Yeah, there's the video version.  Oh, man.  And then there's another section of the shower 
[02:50:00]  where some real slobs are fucking...  Oh, here we go.  You don't have to come with me again.  They're showering.  They didn't finish the class.  Hey, at least you still got a good workout on our side.  That's free.  Wow.  Ha, ha.  Look, they're just showering.  There you go.  Michelle Williams doesn't look bad.  Which one's Michelle Williams?  All the way to the left, the blonde.  That's not bad.  It's gotta be hard to act totally naked. 
[02:50:30]  Don't you think?  Looks like me.  I'd be totally naked and fucking act in the shower.  Who's gonna take a really active interest in whether I shave my legs or not?  And at least after all this time, I like James.  Is it worth trading all that in for something exciting with someone I may not like in 10 years?  Is this girls?  She's a good actress, though.  I think she's really...  I like her face very much.  I think she's really pretty. 
[02:51:00]  She's naked.  You know?  Yeah.  You like her face?  Who's gonna shine?  Who's gonna get old?  I actually found Sarah attractive...  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, years ago.  Who's gonna get old?  Who's gonna get old?  Maybe?  I'm not being, you know, rude or anything.  I'm just saying.  But that Michelle Williams...  I kinda like her.  I kinda like that.  Look.  It's not bad.  Wow, that room is horrific.  Pat from Unaki. 
[02:51:30]  Look at those bushes.  I'm looking at three fuckin' pussy bushes.  Wow.  You think that's it, though?  Wow, those are some horrible people in that shower.  They show...  They switch from the three girls...  There's one that is a mess, but then Michelle Williams and Sarah Silverman, and then they  show another part of the shower where there's some big women.  Where's the Sandusky scene?  That's the good one.  Let me see her.  That?  Yeah, she's still a pretty face. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  You like her?  You think she's a good actress and everything?  Yeah, I like Sarah a lot, actually.  I like that fuckin' movie where she starts mouthing off at the guy in the parking lot and  belts are in the fuckin' face.  I didn't see that.  That's fantastic.  Shit.  Okay, that's...  Yeah, that's a lot different, right?  Ah, fuckin' document expired.  Pricks.  Oh, fudge.  Document expired.  I get sleep right now.  Yeah.  After a good shit.  A good dump.  You feel good?  That was a good post-barbecue shit. 
[02:52:30]  What's better?  What's better?  I'm watching fuckin' hot dogs and whoopie pies and cookies all fuckin' whoopie pies?  Bob's wife made whoopie pies.  What's a whoopie pie?  A lovely treat.  Cake with fuckin', like, cake cookies with whipped cream and stuff.  Is she an enabler for him?  She might be.  What is she doing?  She's a feeder.  Why is she feeding...  Man, she looks pretty goddamn good there.  Why is she feeding him like that?  I don't know.  Maybe she hates him.  Everyone's concerned about Bobby. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, I'm worried about him.  And, uh, you know, he's, um, he's not, uh, getting into his fifth skinny as quickly as he should be.  I agree.  He's keeping his fourth fat a lot longer than we all thought he would.  Yeah, I'm a little worried about him.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, there's a couple other stories I wanted to get to, uh, because, uh, we were discussing them before the show.  One of my favorites, this former NYPD Blue Rider, I guess, he got arrested. 
[02:53:30]  After, uh, he fatally punched a dog in the face.  His four-pound poodle?  And it's not, yeah, he didn't box, duke it out with a pit bull that was fucking going for his throat.  He, he punched, yeah, a four-and-a-half-pound canine.  A poodle.  He belted it in the face so hard that it died, um, from some kind of, uh, brain injury.  What did it do?  It must have bit him. 
[02:54:00]  Lola, the little, little, poor little thing.  And it was a girl.  Sustained a traumatic brain injury from blunt force trauma to the right side of her little doggy head  at the hands of the suspect, who was the owner.  Why wouldn't he die and, why wouldn't he lie and see the dog fell?  I know.  Why would you tell the truth about that?  You don't have to say you punched the dog in the face.  It's not going to fucking, they're not going to do forensics on it.  Say the thing fell.  That is dumb.  Why'd they do that? 
[02:54:30]  Police arrested him at his home, took the dog to the vet, after the dog died.  What?  The dog died on the spot?  Yeah.  They performed a necropsy.  What's that?  It's like the study after it's dead.  Oh, after it's dead.  Is that an autopsy?  Necropsy's when they look at the neck or something?  No, Chip.  I don't think so.  I don't think that's it.  Necropsy and autopsy.  Let's call the whole thing off. 
[02:55:00]  What the, what, I wonder what the difference is.  I don't know.  But I know he punched the dog in the face and killed it.  Yeah.  And he's facing a year in jail.  Really no difference.  It just says necropsy is an autopsy, especially one performed on an animal.  Oh, okay.  So they don't want to humanize the animal by saying autopsy.  He was barking too much!  Sam!  Oh, shit.  This dog didn't fall off the sofa.  He was murdered.  Oh, murdered?  Look at that.  There's a high school ring print in his face, Sam.  How did that get there? 
[02:55:30]  He was frolicking, living the life of a small dog.  And he wandered into the wrong area.  Did you cut him open and check his stomach contents to see maybe what hour he died when  he was punched in the face?  He had some fucking knuckle marks in his kibble.  Punched him in the mouth.  The wife is saying it was a horrible accident.  He meant to punch her. 
[02:56:00]  She was holding the dog and he went to punch her.  How do you face up to a year in prison for helping your dog?  I hope he goes to jail.  Not for a year, though.  That's a long time.  I don't like little animals getting hurt, either.  Yeah.  I'm a softie with fucking animals, man.  Patrice was, like, crazy fucking loved animals.  And I just, yeah.  I don't know.  Some animals I can't fucking stand.  I'm not like one of those all-around PETA people where every animal has the right to 
[02:56:30]  fucking live and flourish and have fun.  Like, some of them, I'm glad they're miserable.  Yeah, how come no one gets married if you punch a silverfish?  Yes.  It really is an unfair love.  Punch one.  Imagine a man arrested for punching a silverfish.  In his bathtub.  That was in his tub.  I hate the silverfish.  It's an ugly...  I used to have them a lot in my old apartment.  Oh, that old, the moldy one?  I lived with Jim.  Moldy apartment?  It's fucking Silverfish Central.  They lived, they fucking loved it there. 
[02:57:00]  God, those fucking commercials.  You could, but you could take the happiest dog in the world and all you gotta do is make  the video a little grainy and put it in slow motion.  And he'll look like he's the saddest fucking dog.  Their eyebrows are constantly going...  They're always moving their eyebrows around like...  And then the shaky, cold dogs.  What is this?  He's shaking.  I feel so bad for him.  Oh, that's Cribs.  Wow.  Oh, that was Cribs' Jim Norton.  That was the one with...  That awful muter museum shirt.  How long ago was this, Stuart? 
[02:57:30]  Can you pop this up?  I'm just kidding.  I don't want it for a second.  I forget.  This is not a 2001?  Was it?  2001?  Holy shit.  Oh my god.  Rick is in there with him.  It's pretty nice.  No, it's not.  It's got...  The ceiling is kind of coming in because, again, the landlord really hasn't been upkeeping  anything.  Our ceiling was caving in.  We've had the ceiling tiles replaced.  We have to put pans down when it drips.  And if you see it, it's really buckled.  Are they peed as pans?  Yes.  Oh, Jade had her Hello Kitty stuff. 
[02:58:00]  It's got stacks of platform shoes.  Oh.  Jim, my chest books.  Oh yeah, I have my Kasparov chest thing.  You could see how you were going with this apartment.  Even though it wasn't all your apartment, not much room.  You could absolutely see your stacking and collecting things.  The place is too small to accommodate three people, so her stuff is pretty much all over 
[02:58:30]  the place.  And so is mine, and so is Jim.  It's really pretty much a dump.  A dump?  Wow.  Oh, the toilet.  Yeah, the bathroom.  A lot of Hello Kitty stuff, huh?  Yeah.  That's adorable.  Wow.  Moldy tub a little bit.  It was moldy, right?  Mold in there.  Could you ever live like this again, Jimmy?  No, right?  No.  Wow, I remember that like it was yesterday.  Fuck.  Um, no, but really disturbing. 
[02:59:00]  I find that odd that like you, it wasn't that long ago, relatively speaking, but you  couldn't live like that anymore.  It was nicer when I moved in.  Really?  Yeah.  But your place now is impeccable, right?  Yeah.  I guess the tub was not.  Yeah, and all the grout is just mold and mildew.  Oh man.  Was that dirty?  Nasty.  I'm a single guy and I, and my tub is nowhere even close to it.  Wow.  Yeah, you guys really, did you, did, did you mind like coming home? 
[02:59:30]  Did you feel like, oh, I'm coming home?  You just didn't, you didn't look around and go like, oh, fuck.  I was dating my ex-girlfriend at the time.  Oh.  In a rusty box.  Wow.  Jimmy still looks exactly the same.  Do you think so?  Ten years later.  Except my hair is grayer.  Yeah, a little bit.  My face looks the same?  Yeah.  Yay! 
[03:00:00]  Yay compliments!  Oh, wow.  Where was that delivery?  Oh, man.  We don't have to watch this whole thing.  I was just, for a second, curious.  I'll watch this later.  Yeah, it's a lot of, it's a lot of fun, I think.  We can't live in this environment.  Wow.  Turn it up a little.  There's an empty water bottle just laying sideways.  Yeah, it was kind of dirty.  There's a lot of clutter.  Yeah, I can't see you as a guy that would like that. 
[03:00:30]  Garbage.  The garbage is really full.  Yeah.  My Starbucks cup?  Was that a problem with garbage, like, taking the garbage out?  No.  Pots and pans on the stove.  Jim would use that every day for his eggs.  And he wouldn't wash it?  No.  Oh, God.  That's pretty disgusting.  Yeah.  It's just black and white spots like a cow.  Window treatment.  Is that my room or no?  No, that's the living room.  Kitchen.  This is Jimmy's old place. 
[03:01:00]  Wow, that was clutter.  Just empty eggshells.  Dude, it honestly looks like a hoarder's house.  Someone had a nice 17 egg omelet.  It kind of looks like a hoarder's house.  Wow, yeah.  It wasn't that bad, but...  Well, at the beginning...  There's no bugs, except silverfish.  Yeah.  Here's the fridge.  Fridge is okay.  Fridge is good, right?  Is it?  Is it dirty?  No.  Wow.  Was it?  I don't know.  It looks fairly normal when you first open it up, but then you start counting how many  things of eggs he's got.  That was Jim.  He would fucking just buy egg whites every morning. 
[03:01:30]  Jim has like huge cartons of eggs all over.  Wow.  He still do that?  He's got all these...  Florentine.  I don't know.  Does he?  I'm going to see him in a couple hours.  Ask if he still eats a lot of eggs.  It needs to be thrown out.  It's bad for you.  Too many eggs.  Is that a banana?  Holy Christ!  A rotted banana in the bottom of the refrigerator?  I don't know.  Was there?  It might have been.  Oh, maybe...  Oh, a rotten...  A whole bunch of bananas. 
[03:02:00]  Brown, green, bluish bananas.  Those are not good.  Rotted.  Were they rotted?  Those are rotted.  They're a little ripe.  Yeah, they're a little ripe.  Oh, dearly loud.  Yeah, well...  Holy crap!  Yeah, you could ace this.  Wow, wait.  That's a...  Wow, you really...  You stepped up your game a little bit there, Jim.  I will say this.  I moved into New York after we...  I finally got a contract from NEW. 
[03:02:30]  I moved in in April of 2002.  Oh, uh-oh.  And my rent was...  Hold on a second.  I'll tell you what my rent was at that time.  I went from a...  I split a $900-something-dollar rent between three of us.  So three-something a month.  That's nice.  I then moved into New York a $2,300-a-month rent.  You went up $2,000.  I went up $2,000.  Yeah.  And we were thrown off the air five months later. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, man.  Oh!  Perfect timing.  Fucking panicked!  You must have.  Oh!  You made it work, though, right?  Yeah.  You didn't have to move.  No, no, it was okay.  No.  I was scared, man.  I had to work like a fucking dog.  Oh, just the thought of that.  Yeah.  Big...  That's why I'm careful about doing anything, like, until our contract is good for next...  Oh, I know.  That's...  You know.  Believe me.  I'm pretty, um, pretty sharp on the old dump button right here.  I don't look...  I don't look much different now.  You don't. 
[03:03:30]  I just wanted another compliment.  Yay!  You look a little older, and it looks like you put some weight on.  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Do you mean back then?  Yay!  It's terrible.  I did put some weight on, but I'm working on...  Oh.  You look great.  Hey!  Yay!  Compliments!  Really?  But when I shave my head, I still look just as young.  Just as young.  Yay!  If that's somewhat younger.  Yay!  I like the old Jim better.  No!  No!  Oh.  No!  Come on. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, boy.  He's a good egg.  Uh, well, I guess we'll take a little break, and then...  Yeah, might as well, since I'm old and fat, and just gotta relax.  Oh, Jimmy.  Watching those videos is sad.  Why is that?  I look so much different.  I'll tell you, you do look different in the videos, because you look so much better now.  Yay!  Yay!  Compliments!  Compliments!  Yay!  I'll say what I always hate when people say on radio shows that I like listening to, 
[03:04:30]  so if you like this show, you might feel the same way, but if you don't, then it doesn't  matter.  I used to hate when I'd listen to a show, and they'd be like, okay, we'll be back to wrap  this up when we get back.  And I'd be like, oh, no, they're leaving.  Yeah.  Oh, go back real good.  Oh, my God.  Look at my room.  Sorry.  Look at my dump room.  Your mattress is on the floor.  No, it's not.  Oh, it's not?  Pardon.  Pardon.  Oh, I plugged my town hall gig.  I remember that gig. 
[03:05:00]  Call ticket master for tickets.  I don't know what the heck that is.  Look at your big CRT television.  Wow, wait.  There is literally six inches on the floor that you walk and stand.  That's like a hoarder room, dude.  Oh, but look at the good friends.  Pause.  Good friends.  Good friends.  Pause.  That's me, and on the left, I used to, this was covering a hole in my wall.  It was a fucking, that's Club Soda Kenny.  That's Dice's son Max when he was younger.  That's Dice, Happy Face, and me.  And it says good friends in colorful party font. 
[03:05:30]  Good times.  I think we're all in great adventure.  Yeah, yeah.  Good friends, good times.  Oh, that's sweet.  I wish I still had that.  What'd you do?  Throw it away?  No, I probably still have it.  You just left it there.  I can't imagine you threw anything away.  That was a mess, right?  Wow, what a pigsty.  Your fucking room is a disaster.  Oh, God.  You were into all kinds of colognes.  Oh, by the way, look at my fucking odium.  That was my little spray.  You have all kinds.  What's in the cups?  Change.  Caesar's man. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, shit.  You do have a lot of colognes and sprays and stuff.  Wow.  What's that about?  Tiffany for men.  Oh.  Do you know I still have that one cologne all the way on the left?  I spend a lot of money on them to make up for the other inadequacies of my life.  That looks like I'm looking into a mirror.  All right, we can go.  I just want to put a pigsty.  This is weird, man.  Yeah, look up Jim Norton Cribs on YouTube.  What a pig.  It is a good one.  Wow.  Oof.  Your room is a disaster. 
[03:06:30]  It was.  I was a messy Marvin.  Why didn't you pick up some stuff?  I don't know.  There's my laundry basket.  I didn't have room.  Like, look at the right side of your bed.  It's just covered.  That's all videos and stuff.  You can't just walk there.  Look at my kiss book.  Yay, Gene.  Look, there's me and Ozzy up there.  Yay.  Me and Ozzy picture.  Yay.  Oh, shit.  That's great.  My candle, my VCR, my covered VCR. 
[03:07:00]  You have a covered VCR.  I had plastic, so dust didn't use it.  Plastic cover.  I forgot about that.  My grandparents had one of those.  Yeah.  Wow, what was that?  Dust cover.  Top loader?  Yeah, I had all that.  Yeah, look at all your videos.  Oh, we have Vimbox back there.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I bought that fucking bed used from my friend Artie Fletcher.  What is that?  A used bed.  A book?  It's a book.  Oh, I saw that.  I still have that. 
[03:07:30]  Jewish comedians or something.  The Haunted Smile.  Yeah, about Jewish comics.  Oy.  The Haunted Smile?  Why are you smiling, Ozzy and Ghosts?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, you're a disastrous mess in your room.  Yeah, wow.  The evil that men do.  Small paperback.  I had awful books.  A picture of Jimmy.  Sorry.  What a change.  I don't want to watch this now.  Watch the movie.  That's creepy.  You think that was a messy room? 
[03:08:00]  It's a disaster mess.  Look at that on the floor, how bad that was.  Why?  I was just busy.  Oh, yeah?  Was that it?  My old dresser.  What's in there?  I'm opening a box.  Yay!  There's a box.  It's got a little globe on it.  Oh, there's pictures in there, probably.  Pictures and stuff.  Oh, when I was a kid.  Oh, it's little Jimmy Norton pictures.  You were looking at me pictures when I was a kid.  You were so molestable.  Oh, I really was.  If I wasn't fucked and somebody missed the boat.  Oh, totally.  Yeah.  That was me and my sister.  Oh, that's cute.  All right.  You're adorable.  All right. 
[03:08:30]  We'll be...  Oh, no.  My fucking videos.  Piss girl.  Piss girl and some like it wet.  Those are my golden shower fucking video cassettes.  That you put in your covered VCR.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Piss girl.  That's fantastic.  Oh, the mold.  All right.  Finally, the mold behind the picture.  God, that was...  That's how I lived.  Now you're leaving.  Oh, look.  Let's look at the little...  All right.  A little foyer.  A little foyer.  All right. 
[03:09:00]  Well, I guess we'll return and we will finish up with the program right after these words.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  I drew a wish in a well.  Don't ask me.  I'll never tell.  I looked at you as it fell.  And now you're in my way.  I trade my soul for a wish.  Pennies and dimes for a kiss.  I wasn't looking for this. 
[03:09:30]  But now you're in my way.  Your stare was holding.  Rip Jean's skin was showing.  Hot night.  Wind was blowing.  Where do you think you're going?  Turn it off, stupid.  Just turn it off.  Those singing bits.  I don't like those.  When any of us do it.  I mean, it's just, I don't know.  I'm singing bits.  It's like, all right.  You know, we've done the Kenny thing.  I think Kenny's very funny.  I think his singing voice is very wacky.  But we've done it.  Right?  Right, Kenny? 
[03:10:00]  Yes, sir.  All right.  I didn't want to hurt your feelings.  He doesn't care.  No reason to be redundant.  Yeah?  Yes.  Redundant.  See, we were taking a single break and playing a song.  What are we doing?  Yeah.  We're taking a quick break.  We're going to wrap up in 13 minutes.  Yeah.  We don't have to play a protracted tune.  Who's laughing in the car?  The guy can't sing.  Sounds like a number one hit tune.  Hey, the guy can't sing.  Wow.  It's wild. 
[03:10:30]  Awful.  It's crazy.  Jimmy, this woman got to quite the surprise.  One of my favorite stories of the day.  Fucking pig.  That could be my favorite story of the year.  It is a good one.  Some woman was, what the hell, she eating a semi, who eats semi-cooked squid?  She probably thought it was fully cooked.  Oh.  She was eating a semi-cooked squid. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  And reportedly, it inseminated her mouth.  Yeah.  The squid did exactly what we would want to do.  What it should do.  Came in her mouth.  Just prematurely shot a load into her mouth.  A 63-year-old woman suffered severe pain and a prickling, prickling, got it?  A prickling foreign body sensation.  What does that even mean?  She just felt something in her mouth that was wrong. 
[03:11:30]  In her mouth, taking a bite of a partially cooked squid.  The unidentified woman bit the squid out immediately, according to the report.  But not before the cephalopod, yeah, it's a cephalopod, injected its sperm bag into the  mucous membranes of her tongue and cheek.  Hey, the old sperm bag.  Researchers later determined that the organisms were sperm bags, not parasites. 
[03:12:00]  They were small, white, spindle-shaped, bug-like organisms.  Yuck.  Well, that's fucking creepy.  They believe the bags were discharged as the woman chewed.  Oh, she chewed the cum into her mouth.  The bags are ejaculatory apparatuses that slowly release sperm when attached to a female's body. 
[03:12:30]  God, don't you wish you had one of those?  You just throw it in your girlfriend's hair before she goes to work?  Most calamari lovers have no reason to freak out, says Dana Staff of the blog Squid a Day.  Squid a Day.  Western squid preparation removes the internal organs of the cephalopod or boils the seafood  long enough to kill the sperm bags.  I would hate to fuck it.  Imagine eating something and it comes in your mouth.  That's the squid's last fighting back.  Yes.  Like, I may be getting half-cooked and eaten alive, but I'll put some fucking goo in your mouth. 
[03:13:00]  You'll lose on this exchange.  And she felt like it made a feeling in her mouth?  It probably felt like a sting.  She felt severe pain.  Are those sperm bags?  I'm trying to find some.  I don't know what this is.  That's jumbo squid sperm.  It looks like fucking porcupine quills.  You Google sperm bags.  It's just pictures of women come up.  I get it.  They're just receptacles. 
[03:13:30]  You fucking sperm bag.  Yeah, put a squid sperm bag.  Yeah.  I would hate to have a...  What's the amount of your mouth?  I had a squid come in his...  Yeah.  It's sore.  Squid shot a load in my mouth.  Squid.  And my eye.  It's all red.  Yeah.  He said he wouldn't, but...  Some squid bukkake.  He inseminated her tongue.  Oh, that's a...  Probably another one.  A clip-up?  Squids live to come in a mouth.  It's only got three views.  Maybe it's brand new.  Oh, oh.  Oh, cool.  It's a good chick talking about it. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  Turn it up.  South Korean woman is giving the term octomom a whole new meaning.  After eating a partially boiled portion of calamari, the woman says she learned she was inseminated  by mouth with 12 implanted baby squid.  The woman explained her experience to researchers in a scientific paper at the Guangdong University  College of Medicine.  Guangdong University?  Come on.  She did not swallow the portion, but spat it out immediately.  She complained of a pricking and foreign body sensation in the oral cavity.  She was rushed to the hospital where doctors initially discovered baby cephalopods. 
[03:14:30]  New Zealand's stuff.nz reports doctors initially thought the babies were parasites  because they were still moving during the examination.  Come on.  She went to the hospital where doctors apparently found a dozen small white spindle-shaped bug-like  organisms.  Researchers later determined that the organisms were sperm bags.  According to the biological bulletin, spermatophores, or sperm bags, are transferred to  a female by a squid's fertilizing arm or penis.  After being discharged, the sperm mass is encased in a thin covering with the cement body 
[03:15:00]  at one end.  This discharge structure may attach to the skin of the female or be deeply embedded in  her skin or muscle.  A squid enthusiast for Science 2.0 emphasizes, though, that spermatophores are normally benign.  First, most western squid preparations remove the internal organs and serve only the muscle.  Benign?  How come they don't get me older?  Second, it's perfectly fine to handle spermatophores.  Just don't put them in your mouth.  Ultimately, doctors were able to remove the squid spermatophores from the woman's mouth. 
[03:15:30]  For Newsy, I'm Lauren Zima.  I snowballed it out.  That's fucking...  Do we look for the squid sperm bag, or, uh...  There's nothing coming up in images, wouldn't you know?  Wow, that's odd.  I typed in sperm bags.  How about the cephalopod?  Cephal...  Put cephalopod...  Cephalopod.  Cephalopod.  Cephalopod.  What is that guy holding?  Is there any video of it?  There might be video on a science show.  Video on the science show of sperm bags.  Papa's got a brand new bag.  I've never heard of sperm bags before. 
[03:16:00]  Putting...  What's the...  How about this?  Um...  Hold on, uh...  Squid zygote.  Let's see what the real name is.  Cephalopod.  Google squid sperm.  Spermatophores.  Yeah.  How about spermatophores?  Yeah.  Five...  Spermat...  Spermatophores.  Double stick.  Fours.  Oh, I think we got something here. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, it looks like a bug.  It looks like a bug.  I don't know what I'm looking at.  What is that all the way to the right...  Like, the right and then up?  That?  No, in the middle.  Go to the middle.  That's it.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  They look like maggots with a hook...  With a hook on them.  Yuck!  To hold onto your tongue so the cum can grow.  Ah!  Oh, fuck!  Fucking yuck!  Oh, that's fucking disgusting.  Her husband won't kiss her for five years.  Never.  It looks like a maggot with a fucking hook at the end of it. 
[03:17:00]  It hooks into you.  That's what she felt.  That sensation was the sperm bag hook hooking into her mouth.  Her mucus.  So the sperm can fucking fly out of the sperm bag.  That's pretty fucking sick.  Oh, my God.  I want no part of that.  Two millimeters.  How big is that?  That's very small.  They're one, two...  They're about four millimeters high, I would...  Or long, I would think.  How big is a squid that she bit into? 
[03:17:30]  Well, the giant squid's giant.  I know.  It's got to be the biggest squid this side of Timbuktu.  And then regular squid or regular.  Oh, this image is part of an article called The World's Most Terrifying Penises.  This is part eight.  The giant squid.  Squid dick is right there.  Squid's got a pretty big piece on him.  Looks like one of his legs.  Yeah.  They're not...  Animal...  Like, especially something animal like that, they don't fuck... 
[03:18:00]  That doesn't feel good to them.  They're not really fucking, are they?  I don't know.  That sperm probably just goes all over the sperm bag.  I hate to be one of those animals that have to reproduce by not really fucking.  Yeah.  Like, the woman lays a fucking bunch of eggs and then you just jerk off on them.  Yeah.  Throw your cum at her as she's fucking running by with a baboon chasing her.  Whatever the fuck.  They all have to cum like multiple migs.  You have to hurl it into her fucking eye hole. 
[03:18:30]  Just heave it into...  Yeah, that's disgusting, man.  That is fucking gross.  Let me ask you, would you rather have a fucking, a little bit of a man's cum in your mouth  or sperm bag from a fucking squid?  No, it's...  If you had to choose.  If I had to choose, it would still be sperm bag.  Oh.  It has to be.  I don't want either, believe me.  But, uh...  It hooks into your mouth.  Whether it's a stupid sperm bag from a squid or Joey Buttlicker's fucking...  Ew.  You know. 
[03:19:00]  Spermy bed knobs?  Spermy bed knobs.  Oh.  Actually, the sperm would probably be Richard's because...  Well, no, because Richard would take the dick.  But what if there was sperm in Joey Buttlicker's ass and then he sat on the bed knob and then  he got shit and sperm on the bed knob.  Oh, wait, look.  What a disaster.  What is that stuff?  Could you turn that up a little?  Maybe we're not.  That's a little bit, Ira.  Mm-hmm.  These things are just exploding.  Oh.  Look at that one right there.  Is it moving? 
[03:19:30]  Is that the cum?  They're moving!  He's coming all over his hand.  He's got sperm bags.  He's got these eggs.  Put these in a bowl together.  Yep.  Ew, you see him?  And they're moving like little fucking maggots all over the place.  Wow.  How can people hold stuff like that?  That is so fucking disgusting.  It looks like he's holding grass.  Yeah, it looks like...  And they're shooting out of the squid.  Goopy grass.  How do I stop it?  Dude, they're fucking shooting out.  They're like an inch long, very thin little white strings. 
[03:20:00]  Sure.  And they're just...  But they look like they're like silly strings shooting out onto his hand.  I just totally got the heebie-jeebies from that.  Look, I'm all goose bumpy.  She had 12 of those in her mouth.  It's disgusting.  It's still moving.  Fuck!  Look at this guy.  The way he's holding...  He must be holding it really well.  It's coming all over the place.  He's jerking it.  Look at how many cum things he has.  Cum things.  Look at that one right there.  Wow, there are fucking things blowing loads all over the place. 
[03:20:30]  See?  Oh, yeah.  It looks like very thin angel hair pasta noodles in green goop.  This squid is fucking jizzing.  Squid loves this guy.  Yeah.  Just fucking jacking them off.  Look at how many fucking loads this thing just shot.  Ugh!  Ugh!  Can you hear the squid?  Ugh!  I didn't know what a squid sounded like.  Yeah.  Ugh!  Squid's coming.  You're about to make some calamari.  Ugh! 
[03:21:00]  God, that's horrible.  My lunch just came on my wrist.  That is terrible.  I would hate that fucking squid cum all over the place.  Yeah.  Looks messy.  I don't know what it smells like.  Oh, God damn it.  It's fish and cum.  The squid itself is awful looking.  It is like a thing of angel hair pasta.  Where is the little guy?  That's a hairy squid.  I can't look at this.  They're moving on his hand, too.  It's so disgusting.  That is fucking gross.  Look up squid cum. 
[03:21:30]  Look at it.  And there's like a jizz layer all over his finger.  That thing fucking produces.  Imagine King Kong holding you and you just shoot and cum all over his hand.  That's what it would be.  It's like, oh, oh, oh, big gorilla's holding me.  Oh, oh, oh, he's manipulating my stomach.  Oh, he's just cumming in his hand.  This guy's just, he's got fucking squid cum.  I have a new respect for squid.  Half cooked and bitten into it and it decides to cum in her mouth. 
[03:22:00]  It's just going to fucking shoot a load.  Take that while you go.  Oh, I've had a new fucking respect for squid.  These things can cum under any circumstances.  It's giving me the heebie-jeebies.  The cum moves, too.  Don't you wish your cum fucking would just go like in squid feet?  That's like an eight foot load.  That's like me cumming right now and it attaches to Sam's forehead.  Yeah.  I would love that.  A big fucking sperm cell that looked like a poliwog.  Like, imagine that an inch long just jumping at you. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Ladies, imagine if you had to chew before you swallowed.  I would hate to fucking have squid cum on my hands and then lunch cum.  You know how good you get to wash your hands and get squid cum off?  Yeah.  Cum is actively holding on.  It's moving.  Oh, it's making me itchy.  Hate it.  It's probably latching into his fucking parasitic.  Do girls ever think that that's like this little thing's moving around in that shit when they swallow it?  Like little fucking buggy things just swimming? 
[03:23:00]  You ever think of that, ladies?  Or do you just fucking, yes, yes, yes, shut up, Ant.  Yes.  You do?  You think of that?  Because when we go down on your pussies down there, there's none of them bugs.  You know, on a cellular level, there's shit, but it's not like a sperm cell.  You put sperm under a microscope at relatively low power, you're seeing some shit move. 
[03:23:30]  They're swimming.  You think you swallow and some of them are trying to swim their way back up your tongue and shit?  No, they're just stupid.  They're trying to impregnate the stomach, whining.  They're just fucking swimming.  Trying to work their way into a fucking acid gland in the stomach, thinking it's a fallopian tube.  Just burning up.  Oh, I don't like that.  Yeah, I know.  I'm turning chicks off to blowjobs.  Is that a bad thing, guys?  Yeah.  Did I do something bad there?  Yeah, you gotta get them down there.  You gotta go, look, there's some medicine in there. 
[03:24:00]  Medicine?  Sperm cells.  Fucking get right down here and suck.  Nobody believes that.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fuck you, cuck sucker.  Fuck you, dude.  You got squid cum all over your fucking eyes and teeth.  Yeah, really?  Piece of shit.  You know all about cum, don't you?  So?  What does it taste like?  What does it taste like?  Bleachy.  No, I don't.  What does it taste like?  Fucking bleach.  All that white stuff is actually the cells, the sperm cells.  And then the clear stuff is what they're swimming in.  It's crazy.  It's like one of those self-serve fountain Coke machines. 
[03:24:30]  They're mixed together.  The syrup and seltzer are mixed right at the last minute.  They're funny.  It happens right when you shoot a load.  It's like your prostate goes and squeezes out that fucking clear shit.  And then your balls are like, here's some fucking swimmies.  And it just pops out of the fucking receptacle and right into your chick's  face.  That should be the next how much?  Is it four parts semen?  Three parts sperm?  It sounds like Die Hard with a Vengeance.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  If I take a bucket of semen and mix it up and then, yeah. 
[03:25:00]  Well, I'll leave you ladies with that to chew on.  Leave that for a little taste in your mouth.  Can I plug something as we're wrapping up?  Oh, Jim.  This Friday, my first LA show in fucking years.  Ooh, LA.  Or maybe in two years.  Where are you going to be?  The Improv, one night only.  This June 22nd, 8 o'clock show.  HollywoodImprov.com.  Saturday, August 11th, I'm doing the Antisocial with Artie, Dave Attell, and Nick DiPaolo 
[03:25:30]  in Hammond, Indiana, which is right outside Chicago at the venue at Horseshoe Casino.  And then Saturday, August 25th, just me and Dave alone will be in Hampton Beach Casino  Ballroom.  Go to Ticketmaster if you want.  And if you don't, then don't.  That sounds like a treat right there.  Jimmy Norton.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  Anything else?  That was a lot of fun.  No, I guess we'll be back tomorrow.  I don't know.  I've heard no progress reports on Mr. Hughes.  I think Opie had an incident eating seafood. 
[03:26:00]  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Bit into something.  Oh.  He was having the shrimp.  He's having squid cum taking off his sock.  Yeah.  The throat sore from all the hooks.  Yeah.  A lot of hooks in that thing.  Those hooks.  They're just holding on to his larynx.  Because he ate a lot.  He ate like 20 pieces of squid.  He's coated with squid cum.  Coated.  Lucky devil.  Yeah.  All right.  And we will be back.  Same bat time.  Same bat channel, huh? 
[03:26:30]  That's what they're going to say.  All right, take it.  We'll see you.  All right.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  Three seconds out.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:27:00]  These interns are all disasters today.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  I don't know what goes on in here.  At some point, I've got to figure out who was screening calls today.  Because I definitely have got to figure out who put that guy on the show and wrote that he was the auctioneer from Storage Wars.  I knew, by the way, when I said that the call screen said that somebody had written that the auctioneer from Storage Wars was on the phone, that it wasn't the auctioneer from Storage Wars. 
[03:27:30]  Didn't you know that that was, Eric, that that couldn't be the auctioneer?  Yeah.  When I looked at it and I said, what is this?  And he said, oh, this guy had his bin or his container, whatever, sold by the auctioneer from Storage Wars.  So I said, okay.  And then I looked at the line and went, oh, fuck.  So why didn't you tell him to change it?  I was trying to, well, he was terrified because he knew I told you, and when Connor had tried changing stuff in the middle of when Opie picked up the phone line, he got yelled at. 
[03:28:00]  So they're all terrified of doing the phones right now.  So they think that you get yelled at less if you just leave it wrong as opposed to changing it at the last minute?  Yeah.  Leaving it wrong is just better.  I don't know where their logic is on any of this.  I don't either.  It's a very disgusting way to end the show today.  Unfortunately, Opie could not be here.  Can we get an update on Opie?  Why don't you text him or something?  Yeah.  You're not going to, huh?  You want to go ahead.  Well, I'm on the air right now.  You're pretty close with him lately.  You should text him.  You won't text Opie? 
[03:28:30]  You can if you want.  I'm not asking you if I can.  I know I can.  I'm asking you if you can.  I don't bother the hosts while they're out.  Well, yeah, because they'd never do that to you, right?  Yeah.  You're not going to text him?  All right.  All right, yeah.  Text him and say, how are you feeling?  The audience.  Just write, hey, Opie, how are you feeling?  The people want to know.  Sam is demanding an update.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They say, and write, the people want to know.  And then you let me know what happens with that.  All right, Sam. 
[03:29:00]  Good.  I got to tell you, though.  Ant did it again today, and I don't think I've brought it up before.  But one of my favorite things that's happened in the last few months  is the new Ant's dad impression.  Son of a bitch.  I love when Ant does his dad.  He just started doing it, like, a couple months.  Because of him telling these stories, he never really did a, like, he would do his mom and  he would do Sal, but he would never do a voice for his dad.  And then all of a sudden, like, literally, it was a month or two ago, he starts doing 
[03:29:30]  his dad.  Now, I think that if his dad were still alive, if Anthony's dad were still alive, he'd be  proud of him.  Roland, is your dad proud of you?  I don't think so.  You're not sure?  Yeah.  Is he happy with the way you've turned out as a person, or just with your life?  He said, you were always weird, and I maintained the level of weirdness, so he's happy.  What about career-wise?  Yeah.  Is he happy?  Because he's a chef, correct?  Mm-hmm.  Without saying too much. 
[03:30:00]  Is he happy that you're, how far away you are from that world?  Yeah.  He didn't want you to follow in his footsteps?  He sort of did, but he said, do what you want, and that's all.  But you've made something out of what you want, so he's happy for you.  Yeah, he said, just do it, don't ever, when I first started, he said, don't ever bitch  to me, you're tired, and put in 15 hours a day.  Your dad said that?  Oh yeah, that was my first day in my internship, I was like 14, 15.  What were you interning for?  Warner Brothers on the studio a lot, just getting coffee and lunches for celebrities. 
[03:30:30]  What movies were they doing at that time?  Sandra Bullock was doing her first movie, like, it's like all the...  Speed?  It was...  No, it wouldn't have been that long ago.  I think, I forgot which one, I think Time to Kill or something there?  Mm-hmm.  It was like her, Gwyneth Paltrow was doing a movie.  Duets?  No.  Shakespeare in Love?  I don't think that one, no.  A View from the Top, I was there too, but that was later.  That was later on.  Yeah, but I did a bunch of different...  All you do, just go around, and you just give food.  You're just like a gopher.  That's all you do for hours. 
[03:31:00]  Man, pain you do.  But you get to interact with...  Did you actually get to interact with these celebrities?  Mm-hmm.  And how old were you?  Like 15, 14, 15.  All right, so that's cool.  Yeah, and then my dad goes, if you're tired, don't ever come back again.  Wow.  So you have to put in 15, 16 hours a day, and you'll get paid.  What about you, Sal?  You haven't done much.  Are your parents proud of you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  How come?  Well, I was very active in high school.  Oh, well, you're a cheerleader?  I was.  No, I was in a band and played a lot.  A band? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Successful band?  I mean, you know, indie successful.  I mean, you actually did shows?  Yeah, I played...  Sal and the Paisanos.  Is that what it was?  Sal and the Paisanos?  No, no.  I played, like, CBGBs last weekend.  I played in Ireland once.  Oh, Mr. Salvatore.  Did some international gigs, yeah.  So your parents like what's happened to you?  Oh, yeah.  They're very happy.  What about the fact that now you've got this day job?  They're very happy.  They like it better than you pursuing the music?  Yeah, well, you know, I still do the music thing on the side, but, like, they still...  Like Troy's DJing thing. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  And you do the music thing.  Yeah.  How come you production guys can't just do production?  It's hard.  It's hard to get that steady clientele.  It really is.  But you got it now.  How so?  You're here.  Yeah, I'm here because I have a steady job, but, like, doing my freelance music stuff...  But that's what I mean.  How come you can't just be here being a production guy?  Like, how come all the production guys have to have little side things?  Is it the creative outlet?  Yeah, I mean, yeah, you also get to be more in the driver's seat when you're producing,  you know.  It's mind-numbing sitting in front of a computer all day? 
[03:32:30]  No, I enjoy it.  So how come you got to also be in a band?  I don't know.  You just...  It's crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  You get your...  For the bitches?  For the bitches.  Why else?  No, it's good to be creative in a different sense than, you know, show-related stuff.  I see, I see.  Yeah.  What about you, Eric?  Is your dad and mom, are they proud of what's become of old chubby radio fan Eric Nagle?  I'm not in the house, so my dad's happy.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:33:00]  He's happy I left.  That's it?  No.  I'm sure there's more to it, but that was the big thing.  What, what, Roland?  Nothing.  What are you laughing at?  You got your hands up in the air.  It's just like, you know, hey, chubby Nagle.  He goes, yeah, I know.  My dad's proud of me without missing a beat.  Well, I just pictured him as a very chubby little kid collecting Scott and Todd radio tapes  in Florida.  Nope.  And just his parents being like, one day you'll be in radio.  And Eric in his little yellow Hulkamania underpants on.  So many things wrong with that statement.  All right. 
[03:33:30]  Well, it's just the way I picture it.  Okay.  It's a little story that I paint.  Now I picture it.  So what did you, so, but are they proud of you for what you've made of yourself?  Yeah.  Even though you end up doing very embarrassing things on the air sometimes?  Well, they're not so proud of that, but they know it comes with, with the position.  With the territory.  With what I'm doing.  They like the position you're in?  Yeah.  I'm not working like in, you know, a minimum wage job somewhere trying to, trying to get  a career going.  So they're, they're happy I'm doing something. 
[03:34:00]  But it seems the way you're talking that they'd be happier if you were doing something, if  you were successful doing something else.  No, my dad loves this.  He does.  Because when he came in here that one time, he was having a field day.  Yeah.  He, he loves all of this.  What about your mom?  Not so much?  My mom, she can only listen in small doses.  Yeah.  What, all the cunt talk?  Is that what it is?  The cunt stuff?  I don't think that bothers her.  What does?  The racial?  When the show gets overly sexual.  That's right.  So when they're talking about putting stuff in cunts.  Yeah, that kind of, she's like, okay, I'm going to the country channel. 
[03:34:30]  She probably just turned it off just now.  When I said stuff in cunts.  Probably.  That would, that's it.  Yeah, she's not listening anymore.  Okay.  That was the line.  Okay.  I just need to know where the line is.  Because the last thing I want is Mrs. Nagel tuning out.  Because I'm talking about, you know.  You calling her son chubby, yeah.  No.  So she doesn't.  Does she mind when the guys start insulting you?  That's a good question, Roland.  I don't think any mom would appreciate that.  I don't think your mom appreciates with it.  Now, apparently she doesn't mind too much because he's listening every day and picking up the goddamn phone every time Obie calls her. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, that's true.  Your mom listens every day?  Yeah, she's right there by the phone, isn't she?  Where's my carrot cake?  She's probably listening right now.  If not, she'll catch the replay.  It's delicious.  But yeah, no.  My parents are very strange.  I mean, they are so...  Well, your dad's a big fan.  Well, they're so happy with the way everything's turned out.  I think they didn't expect anything to pan out and they just thought I was being stupid.  And then it started to pan out.  And they're so happy with it that, you know, they call and talk about their son's penis to my mom. 
[03:35:30]  And she's still like, oh, I'll pick up the phone next time they call.  Like, what are you doing, mom?  You're allowed to, at some point, be offended by something.  But no, it's all roses and sunshine.  Wait, you just said they didn't think it would go this way.  So when you were doing your internship, either for us or with Scorch or, you know, the radio stuff,  where did they think you were going to get a job if you weren't doing the radio?  No, I don't know what they thought I was going to do.  But my dad specifically didn't understand why I was working for free for all this time. 
[03:36:00]  He thought it was stupid.  He was like, you know, what are you doing?  Like, you can't just keep going in for free.  But he worked in a corporation back in his heyday, right?  Like, way back in his heyday, though.  Yeah, but they didn't have interns there, too?  Listen, they're used to, believe it or not, there was a time in this country where you didn't have to,  you weren't expected to work for free for a year before they would even consider you giving entry-level position.  There was a time when you could go to college, get a degree, and people actually hired kids out of college.  What?  Yeah, I'm not kidding you, Eric Nagel. 
[03:36:30]  Back in the long, long ago?  In the long, long ago.  That's exactly right.  Because that's where he came from.  He was like, look, I understand getting an internship.  But you're right, your internship's over and you're still going in for free.  That's stupid shit.  That's dumb.  And I was like, listen, you've got to trust me, okay?  I've got a plan.  I've got a plan.  Now, I don't have, my plan is usually about 15 minutes ahead of where I am right now.  You know what I mean?  It's not a huge advanced plan.  But I'm always planning a little bit in advance.  That's the way to live life.  That's all you need. 
[03:37:00]  That's all you need.  And so far, it's worked out gangbusters.  I used to just say, it's going to work out at some point.  Yeah.  I mean, if your perspective is Twitter followers, I've done a great job.  Economically.  Are they proud of you for your Twitter followers?  Well, they're searching my ad mentions at home.  They're maniacs.  They're very weird people.  You live with super fans.  Yeah, I don't know why they do it.  You know, Sam, they go home for dinner.  Or, I know, I was reading on Twitter, one fan said.  And she starts reading some fucking asshole's tweet that I didn't like the first time I read it. 
[03:37:30]  And now my mom is reading it as if it's like, I can't believe what they say.  Well, if you can't believe it, why would you repeat it to me?  Now I'll Twitter you something.  Do you want to see if she'll come on?  No, I don't want to see if she'll come on.  She's got enough time.  She hasn't been on in a while.  All right, call her.  Okay.  Let's see how she's doing.  And I also need to check on my dad.  Because like we said at the top of the show, I did ditch my dad for the wrestling show.  But you've got to understand.  Do you see those seats? 
[03:38:00]  Do you see the Twitter picture?  Yeah, I just saw the photo.  You've got to understand that, right, Sal?  No, I can't.  I don't like wrestling.  But look at those seats.  Like, that's not going to happen every day.  Yeah, that's pretty sick.  Eric, I yelled at.  Yeah, I'm definitely going to talk to Eric about that in a couple minutes.  I'm going to keep this short with my mom.  Because I've got stuff to do today.  I've got to talk to Eric.  I've got to talk to phone screener Rob.  And don't think, ladies and gentlemen, here on After Open Anthony Live, that I've forgotten what I promised on Friday.  Don't think we're going to let anything fall by the wayside. 
[03:38:30]  We will talk to spazoid intern Kevin in a little bit.  Kevin, don't you bring that ass down this hallway anytime soon until I call you.  Is that her, Eric?  Can I just pick up?  He's not giving me an answer, Sal.  I don't know what to do around it.  Yeah, all good.  Okay.  Hey, Mom?  Yeah, how you doing, Sammy?  Listen, we were just talking about how weird you are.  Is there never a time...  I'm not going to keep you on for too long. 
[03:39:00]  And I'm certainly not going to ask you embarrassing questions about me.  Thank you, Sam.  Of course.  I respect you.  But is there...  What has there been that has offended you on this show?  We were talking...  Because we were talking with Ant today about the fact that he's not sure...  He thinks his dad would like the fact that he's made a career for himself if his dad were still alive.  But that his dad would probably not like him working in entertainment, would probably rather him have a construction job.  Because his dad was very worried about him being, you know, a little bit of a faggala, you know what I mean? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  And so, you know, we were talking about that and I was talking to Eric about how his parents react to him being on the air and getting made fun of and all this stuff.  And we were just...  Like, I was trying to explain to them how strange it is that both you and Dad get this weird kick out of everything that has to do with me on the air.  Even if...  Like, there's stuff that bothers me that I don't get a kick out of that I go to your house and you're like, oh, that was so funny.  I was so good to hear you. 
[03:40:00]  You know, I heard you're making fun of me.  Yeah.  Well, what is it?  Like, why is it that, like, you're reading Ant mentions from these weirdos and then, you know?  Because I just think it's fun.  You do.  You think the whole thing is fun.  I do think it's fun, Sam.  And you know what?  I am waiting for you to introduce me to more famous people.  Is that what it is?  You just want to meet celebrities.  Uh-huh.  Yes, exactly.  And, you know, can you tell me when that's going to happen? 
[03:40:30]  Well, I'll tell you this, Mom.  Yep.  Roland, you know a lot of celebrities.  Yeah.  What can...  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  Roland is one of the celebrities that you've introduced me to.  What?  And Troy, and I must say, the real biggies, like, you know, Jimmy and Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  She really is.  Those are terrific.  But I'm, you know, you've met more big celebrities that, you know, you haven't introduced me to yet.  Okay. 
[03:41:00]  First of all, you said it, you hit the nail on the head, E-Rock, when you said she's a super fan.  And second of all, you remember my mom's first appearance on the show was when Mick Foley fed me, when he fed me steak, and I regurgitated, and I gagged, and I vomited and stuff, and Louis Black and Bob Saget were in the studio that day, and they called my mom after it happened and talked to her about the whole thing, and she immediately started calling her sisters.  And do you think she said, oh, my God, Sam was in the most humiliating incident on the air today. 
[03:41:30]  I don't know why he does it to himself.  This was just, it doesn't make sense to do it to the family.  You think she said that, Roland?  No.  You know what she said?  I talked to Bob Saget.  That's exactly what she said.  She goes, oh, you'll never believe it.  I was on the radio today with Bob Saget.  She's like, what?  That's what you draw from that?  Well, you know, I mean, you were with Mick Foley, so it didn't matter how abusive or insulting or scary the things were, you were with Mick Foley, so you were really happy, am I right? 
[03:42:00]  You're probably right.  Here's the question, though.  Roland, what can my mom do for you?  Like, what can she get you?  Care cake.  To get some celebrity meetings?  Easily care cake.  So, you hear that, Mom?  What do I have to do?  Carrot cake is the answer.  Roland is always talking about your carrot cake. 
[03:42:30]  Thank you, Roland.  It's delicious.  Okay, it's a carrot cake for Roland.  I haven't done any celebrity.  What celebrities do you want to meet?  I had no idea that this was your motivation behind this, by the way, but what celebrities do you want to meet?  Well, I must say that I heard Willie Nelson was up at Sirius not long ago.  He was a few weeks ago.  Fun guy to meet.  Can you hook up a Willie Nelson meet and greet?  When he comes back, yeah, he'd meet everybody.  There you go, Mom.  You got a Willie Nelson next time Willie Nelson comes back. 
[03:43:00]  There's a Tom Jones coming up.  When I come to see Willie Nelson, I'll bring a carrot cake for Roland.  You want to meet Tom Jones?  Roland is offering Tom Jones.  Tom Jones is, you know, let's go for somebody else.  She doesn't like Tom Jones.  She thinks he's a creep.  If you could do Lady Gaga, that'd be great.  Look, I'm trying to get a Lady Gaga meeting right now.  Mom, why don't you wait your turn?  All right?  Let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got your Willie Nelson.  Now, this is the other thing I wanted to ask.  Is everything okay there, the fact that I blew off Father's Day to go to a wrestling show last night?  Well, we did have some discussion about that and what your priorities should be.  But, you know, if you come over and you describe everything that's happened for the wrestling show  and talk about, you know, anybody you met.  And I want to know about this thing, if CM Punk really winked at you.  I swear to God he did. 
[03:44:00]  Yes, he did.  You can watch it on pay-per-view.  He was, like, pointing right at me, stopped and made eye contact, and then he pointed and winked.  That's a biggie, Sam.  Yeah, Eric.  Jim posted on Twitter begging CM Punk to tell the world that he did not wink at you.  And CM Punk follows Jim, so I hope he doesn't say that just to get in Jim's good graces, because it's not true.  He did wink at me.  Well, I also saw on Twitter that you had a lot of FaceTime because of where your seats were and everything last night. 
[03:44:30]  Apparently.  We were right on the aisle.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's impressive.  Eric was there.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  Yeah, Eric was not there because his wife didn't let him go because she made him go to her in-laws.  Well, you know what?  It was like we didn't seem to have any choice because you didn't say, like, oh, you know, like, I really feel bad and I wish I didn't have to do this.  But, you know, I got these great seats in it.  You just said, I can't make it for Father's Day. 
[03:45:00]  I'm going to be in New Jersey.  That is how it went down, isn't it?  I called you and said, look, I'm not going to make it for Father's Day.  Exactly.  Yes.  So, you know, I mean, what could we do?  But, you know, we just carried on without you, Sam.  Everything was okay?  Everything was okay.  But we did miss you.  Don't get me wrong.  But Dad's feelings weren't hurt.  We missed you, but we just thought, you know, there was no choice there.  You just had this thing happening.  But Dad's feelings weren't hurt?  Well, you know.  Listen, did he see the. 
[03:45:30]  You're going to have to spend some extra time with him to make up for it.  Did you see the picture that I tweeted?  Did you see where the seats were?  Yeah.  All right, so.  I mean, you were almost in the ring.  See?  Listen to that enthusiasm.  All right, well, show Dad the picture again.  I'm sure he'll feel better.  Okay.  He did.  He said, wow, look where Sam's sitting.  All right, well, I.  You know, that helped a little.  But I got to tell you, it's like the first family gathering almost, you know, that you. 
[03:46:00]  Well, it is the first family gathering that you've had to miss.  Because although you did miss Mother's Day because you were doing your live show,  at least you did come over, you know, in the evening after your show was over.  I did.  I missed Mother's Day because I came in here to do a show.  But Sal missed Mother's Day, too.  What about Fourth of July?  Weren't you in here for Mother's Day?  Mother's Day.  Yeah.  Oh, when you did a show here?  Right.  Maybe, yeah.  Last month.  Right.  Exactly.  That's dedication.  You've got to respect the work ethic.  Are you going to make it for the Fourth of July?  Fourth of July?  I think I'll be here on the Fourth. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, see?  Yeah.  So that'll be fine.  Not the weekend.  On the Fourth.  Oh, that's a Wednesday.  Yeah.  I'm not going to be here that weekend, though.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  You have other things to do.  Yeah, I'll be in Vegas or something.  Well, listen.  I'm going to let you get back to your life because I've got a couple of stupid interns  I've got to talk to.  Okay, well, I've got to tell you, we are very proud of you, Sam, and I'm sure that the  other guy's parents are all proud of them, too.  Well, they could only wish to be blessed with such thankful and proud parents. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, Sammy.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  All right.  Goodbye.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  You see who I have to deal with, Eric?  This is super fan.  It's ridiculous.  Eric got the opposite.  She's going to go Twitter now that she talked to Not Sam.  I just got to talk to Not Sam on the radio.  Oh, you'll never guess who I talk to.  Sam, your mom is very like, you heard your mom and dad like, hey, we've got great seats.  Eric got the opposite.  Yeah.  How can you go?  Eric, man.  What's that?  I don't know who to talk to first.  You know what?  Let me bring the interns in first, and then let me talk to you about that wrestling show 
[03:47:30]  real quick.  See what Sal pulled up.  Yeah, look at that.  Your wife made WWE.  Yeah.  In one of the pictures.  I'm not going to tell you all which picture, though.  No, don't.  Was she happy?  I'm going to drive everyone crazy.  Through the whole show?  She had a great time.  She had a great time.  Yeah, there she is smiling.  That's my finger pointing right next to her.  I was going to say, that's probably Sam's finger.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See, those are great seats, right, Roland?  Yeah.  I mean, we can't really go wrong.  Let's bring in, yeah, Rob first.  I'm only going to spend a couple minutes with Rob.  Rob, just, first of all, earlier on the show today, we were talking about Storage Wars, 
[03:48:00]  and you write on the phone screen, because obviously we have to screen these calls, so  we know what we're going to.  You write up on the phone screen, the auctioneer from Storage Wars, period.  Yes.  And then something else, whatever you wrote.  Now, you couldn't have been more wrong in your description.  Well.  What happened?  And then we ended up talking to some guy for 13 minutes about Etta James.  Did he not take up Samara time?  That's not what we're about here, Rob.  And by the way, I hate it, I hate it when phone screeners put up bad screens and then 
[03:48:30]  say, hey, did it make a good bit?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know why?  Because of the people in the studio had nothing to do with you.  You know what we did?  What?  Not even we.  Anthony and Jim.  You know what they do?  You fling shit at them, and they turn it into gold bricks.  They did.  It doesn't make getting shit flung at you any more pleasant, does it?  No, not at all.  So it had nothing to do with you.  You understand? 
[03:49:00]  No, no, no.  I know.  It didn't take up some airtime.  Why don't you just come in here and fart on a snare drum for a while to take up some  airtime?  Farting on a snare drum.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  We may actually do that bit, though.  But.  Can I just say, I'm sorry.  It's my fault.  I fucked up.  Well, what were you thinking?  Well, the guy said that his unit was sold on whatever.  Not on, by.  By the auctioneer on Storage Wars. 
[03:49:30]  But not on the show.  Not on the show.  It just happened to be the same guy doing the auctions.  Yeah.  And I didn't realize that.  He said it was on the show, but I guess it wasn't.  And I just wrote.  Plus, you wrote that that guy was the auctioneer.  If you take out that period, it would have sounded correctly.  Yeah, but you know what the thing is?  But it didn't.  I know.  The period was there.  You wrote it.  I know.  I fucked up.  I'm sorry.  If you had taken out the period, it would have been correct.  So take it out.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Now.  I didn't mean to.  Is it true that you knew it was wrong and Eric said, like, oh, no, but that you were scared 
[03:50:00]  to change it because last time the other intern got, or did Eric not alert you that it was  wrong?  No, Eric didn't alert me.  I didn't know.  Yes, Eric did alert you to it.  Oh.  You didn't know it was wrong?  No, I, once I read it again and stuff.  You kept going, oh, my God, why didn't I put a comma?  Yeah, I did.  Okay, so you knew it was wrong.  But why would I, well, afterwards, but I didn't want to.  While he was already on the air?  Yeah.  Why?  Oh, okay.  That's different then.  Yeah, exactly.  You can't change it once it's on the air.  The mistake's been made.  Right.  That's why I didn't want to do a, pull a Connor. 
[03:50:30]  Well, listen, as I told Eric, I'd be careful because I'm not quite sure.  Or that trying to correct the mistake right before the mistake is made is worse than just  making a mistake.  I made a mistake.  You're fucking right you made a mistake.  And then you came in here and tried to say, whoa, took a bear.  No.  Do, do, do, do, do.  You don't have to worry about what's taking a bear time.  All you have to worry about is making sure that the coffee that the hosts get is hot, 
[03:51:00]  that the phone screen is accurate, and that your boss, Mr.  Sex, Eric Nagel, that's Mr. Sex to you, a little respect.  Of course.  Is happy.  Mr. Sex, are you happy?  Not right now.  I'm not, no.  Rob, I need you to go in the, in the production room and go make sure Mr. Sex is happy.  Okay.  Right now.  I know how to do that.  I'll bet you do.  I'll bet you do.  Mr. Sex teaches all of you very well. 
[03:51:30]  So, all right, now that we got that out of the way, now that we have that unpleasantry  out of the way, let's move to the next unpleasantry.  Kevin.  I am very pleasant.  No, no, no.  He just laughed at his own comment.  Who did?  Kevin.  He just, unpleasant.  I didn't.  Eric, you don't like Kevin that much.  I like Kevin a lot.  You do?  Yeah.  Okay.  He's entertaining.  Um, oh, okay.  So you like him like that?  Sure.  Like a goof.  I don't take him seriously. 
[03:52:00]  He's liking me, whatever.  Doesn't matter.  Whether people take you seriously or not, as long as they take you.  No, I don't care.  Just as long as.  Now, you're the intern to remind everybody who has ADD and is on Adderall.  Thanks for, yeah.  So what, bringing everybody back up to speed?  You announced it on the air already.  I know I did, but, like, that's me, like, the intern with ADD.  Like, yeah, that's, what do you want me?  Well, you have brown hair.  Oh, yeah, the guy with brown hair.  Yeah, and I got a nose, too. 
[03:52:30]  What the fuck's he talking about, Sal?  He's doing jokes.  He's doing weird jokes.  He's not taking any of this seriously.  Listen, Kevin is the intern with ADD, who is taking, what, 40 milligrams of Adderall a day?  Uh-huh.  And he's looking at me like he's going to kill me, like I'm doing something wrong.  He's weird, dude.  And, uh, and so he said he doesn't feel like himself when he's on Adderall.  So I said, why don't you stop doing Adderall?  I said, you know, you should probably talk to your doctor if you're going to do that.  But, you know, I would say if you don't feel like yourself, you're not in class, stop doing Adderall and just see if you perform better. 
[03:53:00]  Because he wasn't performing very well as an intern.  And you decided to stop.  Correct?  Yeah.  And how's that going?  Why are you frustrated by that?  It's all right.  Yeah, you're looking at me like, yeah, duh.  What was that?  He's doing sound effects now.  That sounded like a fish being stomped on.  All right.  So, uh, you're a difficult one, Kevin.  Oh, yes.  Um, you gotta remember, he's your super fan, so you have to...  I don't think, not anymore. 
[03:53:30]  I am.  I think we've crossed that boundary.  Um, but, okay.  So, how are you feeling not on Adderall?  All right.  Better, worse?  All right.  Like, it's just different.  You refuse to be specific.  How is it different?  Like, I feel like I'm...  You feel more like yourself?  A functioning person.  Not like a...  I like that.  I like that.  You feel like a functioning person.  Like, you feel like yourself.  Like a human being.  Yeah, yeah.  Not like you're...  I feel like a human being.  Not just like...  Like you're not...  Just some bland... 
[03:54:00]  Right.  And that's how you feel when you're on Adderall.  Yeah.  You don't feel subdued anymore.  Right.  You feel like yourself.  Right.  That's great.  Do you think it's, uh, better or worse for your performance as an intern?  Probably worse.  You do?  You got Eric's lunch wrong.  You got Eric's lunch wrong?  I got...  I...  This is like the first mistake I've made with food this entire time.  You look like a guy who knows his food.  No, he messes up my food.  I just eat it.  He fucks up my food all the time.  I just eat it.  I just...  No.  Is that a surprise?  They fucked up Sal's food.  No, no, no.  And I forgot...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Kevin. 
[03:54:30]  I'm gonna tell you one thing real quick.  Any fuck-up that happens between Sal ordering food and Sal receiving food is your fuck-up.  Fine, whatever.  Means you have to watch them when they make the food.  Or maybe check it when they give it to you without putting your greasy little hands on it.  And don't take a bite because I know you get tempted.  I know you get tempted.  Don't take a bite for yourself.  And I've told him, I don't care if you fuck up my food.  He fucked up your food too, Troy?  Yeah, he's fucked up my order.  Okay.  I think I've gotten Troy's one to breakfast many times. 
[03:55:00]  I fucked it up for the same day as his because they both ordered the same thing.  Doing two mistakes in one day does not mean one mistake.  That's two.  Now...  And that said, a minute ago you just said Eric was the first food order you got wrong.  It was...  Because that one really was their fault.  No, it wasn't.  I can't look at their food.  Yes, you can.  No, no, no.  How am I supposed to look at their food?  When you gotta get stuff for the host, you fucking...  You watch everything they do.  Well, yeah.  The host.  Wait, when...  So what are you saying?  Where, uh...  No, because I ordered like 60 things. 
[03:55:30]  Okay, so there's five people.  One, two, three...  One, two, three, four, five of us here.  I've ordered food once since you've been an intern.  It was right.  Good job.  Big deal.  The other four you've gotten...  You've fucked up orders for.  Fucked up once.  On each?  Well, whatever.  That's fine.  Fine, that's way too many.  That's four.  I apologize for my fuck-ups.  Okay.  Now, um...  What did he fuck up with you?  I think the same thing as probably Sal, right? 
[03:56:00]  Wrong cheese.  Me and Troy getting opposite breakfast.  I fucking hate Swiss cheese.  I've asked...  I've got a gag.  Or when he gets to his breakfast, he goes,  Yeah, you're not gonna like what you eat.  Okay, he brings it to me.  He's like, oh, and he gives it to me.  I didn't even open it yet.  And he goes, oh, I think they fucked it up.  And he gave it and he handed it to you.  It was already in there.  And then I came in, I'm like, they probably fucked that up.  But how'd you know they fucked it up?  Because his was fucked up.  Oh.  But was there any point in you to go in and say, 
[03:56:30]  Hey, Troy, they may have fucked up your order.  Let me go and replace it.  I would have.  If he had asked.  He just left.  He just took off.  He took a hike.  Yeah, I did do that that one time.  He's fucked up.  Then I was up, too.  What did he fuck up?  Well, maybe just my directions weren't clear enough.  But I asked for light cream cheese.  Meaning, like, not as much fat in the cream cheese.  Why did you tell him that?  And they just had, like, a thin little layer of cream cheese.  A small amount of cream cheese.  I see.  But you just said, go light on the cream cheese.  Light on the cream cheese.  Yeah.  That's what I thought he meant. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, my bad.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I was talking to you before about making sure,  follow-up questions and clarifications.  That's the only way to get that knowledge.  Am I right?  Yep.  And now I know, so.  We talked to Kevin, you remember, on Friday.  Yeah.  And Kevin had no idea basically what anybody did here.  Like, the most we got out of him, we spent the entire hour show.  And it was 50 minutes.  It was a full hour show trying to find out from Kevin what Eric does here.  It was a question he could not answer. 
[03:57:30]  The closest we got to an answer was he controls the show and hits the buttons.  He hits the buttons and controls the show.  So what I did was I had Kevin interview all the members of the staff  so I could find out exactly what everybody does.  And I told you that when you're interviewing people,  I want you to now possess the knowledge of what everybody does.  Meaning, if you don't understand something, there should be a follow-up question 
[03:58:00]  so that I could ask you any question about what anybody does and you would know.  Did you do that?  Yeah.  You interviewed everybody?  Yeah.  You feel confident?  Yeah.  What does Eric do for the show?  Let's see.  All right.  We'll just wait here.  You, audience, you'll wait with me.  And we'll just give old Kevin a second.  As Who Kid called him a stupid N-word.  Yeah, you can't say it now.  You remember that, right, Roland?  You give him a pass to say it if you want to say it.  Yeah, but I don't want to use the pass unless he's around.  Right.  You got jealous when he gave me a pass?  Of course I did. 
[03:58:30]  Okay.  I got to pull him aside and ask him for a pass.  He runs the Dalit and Profit computers.  Okay.  Dalit and Profit.  Okay.  Which control the archives.  Okay.  He runs...  And the channel.  He plays audio elements not controlled by Opie.  So Opie can control some of them.  Like what?  But he controls the ones that he doesn't...  Like what?  Like the songs and that kind of stuff.  Okay.  Okay.  Like what songs?  Um...  If he wants to play...  Like the intro songs. 
[03:59:00]  If he wants to play...  No, that's fine.  Okay.  Go on.  Okay.  And, uh...  He finds archive material.  Like he can pull stuff up to like fill for fillers and stuff like that.  What does that mean?  For fillers?  Yeah.  It's like if we...  This interview's boring.  No, give it time, Roland.  It is pretty boring.  Give it time.  If there's, um...  Like a gap between when...  Do you have to wake up early?  You seem tired.  Oh, no.  I'm actually pretty good right now.  Nah, I disagree.  But go ahead. 
[03:59:30]  Okay.  Go ahead.  If there's a gap between when Opie and Anthony stop talking and when we need to do like  an ad or something like that, we could put in a filler.  Like a little piece from the show?  Like an old...  Okay.  An old clip.  What else does he do?  Um...  He...  Signals how much time is...  Let me ask you this.  What's the difference between a Dalit and a Prophet?  Why are there two machines that he runs?  The Prophet runs...  That's a tough question. 
[04:00:00]  That's a tricky one, huh?  That's a trick question.  It's not tricky.  It's a difficult question to answer.  But wouldn't...  Because one isn't the others.  Is that the one that we're like, one...  You can't run the other?  It's true.  One is not the other.  It's...  I don't know.  You can't run...  Okay, that's all right.  Is it on a Dalit computer or something like that?  Dalit.  It's...  How do you say that?  Dalit.  Whatever.  Dalit is how you say it.  I did this on Friday.  I forgot by now.  Yeah, of course.  That's acceptable.  Um, all right.  Well, I'm not going to give you credit for that answer, but that's not that bad. 
[04:00:30]  Although, I would have probably asked a follow-up question.  Why do you have two computers in there?  Okay.  Um, what does Roland do?  Roland.  He told me to shut up the first couple times I asked him.  And, um, he goes, go away.  I'm not going to do this.  He does more than Eric.  He books the guests through the publicists, the managers, and the agents.  Right.  But he will not reveal how he finds out they're going to be...  How they're going to be around.  That's fair.  He will not reveal that.  That's fair.  Um, he helps Sam write bits. 
[04:01:00]  That's not true at all.  And he is...  And he is Jesus.  Okay.  Number one, he's not Jesus.  And number two, he's never helped me with any bits.  He's a really funny guy.  Like, I figured he might have helped you.  We've had Roland in the production studio with us.  Is he anything more than a hindrance?  I mean, he adds comic relief to the situation, but he doesn't contribute much.  Oh, I contribute nothing.  No.  To the actual bit itself?  I told him, you're my disciple.  I give you, like, the big ideas.  What does, uh...  What does Danny do? 
[04:01:30]  Danny?  Because a lot of people wonder that because Danny used to be in studio, and now he...  Okay, you go ahead.  He's a senior producer.  I wasn't...  It didn't need a setup.  Well, I have...  I got it covered.  Thanks.  Thank you.  He is excited.  He does the morning prep.  What's the morning prep?  Um, he has the sheets that tell you what, like, some things you could talk about and  the guests that are going to be in.  He writes all those?  Um, either him or Travis write them.  Wait.  Yeah.  Him or Travis? 
[04:02:00]  Somebody.  Somebody.  Okay, somebody writes those.  He writes the morning prep.  Okay.  And he makes sure the talent gets what they need.  Meaning?  Like, if...  Food orders?  We pretty much do food orders.  Right.  Like, but, um, if they're not happy with...  Like, he makes sure that they're getting the right...  I don't know the words for it.  Sounds like bullshit to me.  That's what I got written down. 
[04:02:30]  So, he had to say it.  Who wrote it?  This?  Yeah.  I did.  Okay.  Well, what you have written down is something you wrote.  This is you.  The stuff, um...  What else does Danny do?  He...  Let's get to some specifics.  Don't give me any bullshit.  He makes sure they talk about the stuff that the listeners would find interesting.  How did he do that?  Like, if there's, like, a reoccurring joke in the show or something like that, he would  find a way to, like, get that into the show somehow, so...  How?  Like, he would just, like, tell them the hint...  Like, he...  In the prep thing, he tells... 
[04:03:00]  He writes it on the sheet.  Don't forget to mention...  Right.  Like, linger longer.  Or, like, hey, Ant, Sam liked your impression of your dad earlier.  Maybe you want to work on that today.  Something like that?  He, like, just lets them know.  Right.  How?  On the sheet?  Like, tells them.  Or...  Comes in the studio.  And he goes, hey, Ant, you haven't done the impression that Sam liked.  Something like that?  He makes sure they find a way for him to get the information.  That's fair.  That's fair. 
[04:03:30]  I don't want to ask you too many questions.  That'd be rude.  What else does Danny do?  Anything specific?  Because right now, there are a lot of generalities.  And I know that Danny is a busy guy, so I don't want to understand.  He pays the satellite, which is basically, like...  Uh-huh.  It's basically, like, what sonar is, apparently.  Danny does that.  Danny.  That's what he said.  Okay.  What does he do?  Okay, now I know that this is probably not right.  He said he pings the satellite. 
[04:04:00]  What does it mean to ping the satellite?  From what he described...  Is that Crimson Tide?  One ping, please.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, because I don't know.  I don't know the backstage stuff.  I'm in the studio all the time.  What he described it to me as, as it's basically sonar, and, like, you can tell how far things  are away, so you know how long the lag is.  Oh, okay.  So he actually, from his office, measures how far away the satellite is. 
[04:04:30]  That way we know the lag, the delay type of thing.  Is that right?  Yep.  And he does that by doing what to the satellites?  Pinging.  Troy, have you ever...  I know you've had a lot of odd jobs around here.  Pinging the satellites?  Have there ever been one?  Well, I'm just not familiar with pinging the satellites.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Eric.  That's what he said.  Who fills in...  Do you know?  I don't know, because when Danny's not here... 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  Sam's crying.  Um, no, my, uh, yeah, uh, my mom just texted me my, uh, dog's dad, so don't worry about  that.  Um.  Did somebody punch it?  Yep.  Um, who fills in for Danny as far as pinging, as far as pinging the satellites goes when Danny's  not here?  I don't know.  I'm in here during the live show, so I don't know who judges in the back.  Travis probably pings him?  Okay, yeah.  You don't know who fills...  Maybe Rob Cross does it.  You don't know who pings when Danny's not here, do you?  Nope. 
[04:05:30]  Okay, what else does Danny do?  Uh...  I don't know how to pronounce that word, so I'm not gonna say that.  Well, what is it?  I'll help you.  Esquilix.  What is that?  I don't know.  Something like you do audible, he does Esquilix.  Spell it.  Okay.  E-S-Q-U-A-L-I-X.  Esquilix.  Okay, no, Esquilix, and I do audible, what is Esquilix?  Something that we have to send the show to.  Okay. 
[04:06:00]  We have to send the show to...  I did ask a follow-up question, I just forget.  We have to send the show to both Audible and...  What was the other one?  Esquilix.  Okay.  All right, what else does Danny do?  Kevo.  I'm working on it.  No, I know.  You have to...  I know it's trouble reading.  He pings the satellites.  I'm trying to pick something to say that won't sound stupid.  Just say the next thing.  He's a neurocaster supervisor. 
[04:06:30]  He's a neuro...  Dan.  Narrow casting supervisor.  Okay.  So...  Which is basically inside jokes for listeners again.  What is?  Narrow casting supervisor.  Okay, so Danny, that's one of his roles here.  He narrow casts...  He's the supervisor of narrow casting?  Yeah.  What is narrow casting?  It's getting a joke to, like, not...  Like, the whole audience won't get it, but, like, the small part of, like, loyal listeners  will, like, find it more funny. 
[04:07:00]  So you're saying there's broadcasting, which is, like...  Getting it out to everyone.  And then narrow casting.  And then if we have an inside joke, that's narrow casting.  And what is Danny's title as far as narrow casting goes?  Narrow casting supervisor.  Did you realize he was given the title of narrow casting supervisor, Troy?  I wasn't aware of that, but, again, I don't know what goes on.  You don't know every person.  I just sit in my little studio.  Eric, have you ever been in charge of narrow casting?  No.  Like I said, I'm in here when the live show's on, so I don't know.  So we don't know for sure. 
[04:07:30]  Anything else that Danny does?  Pretty much, like, just make sure the talent and the listeners are happy.  Well, you know what?  Can I tell you something?  What?  If the listeners are on the same level that I'm on right now,  I think Danny has made sure they're happy.  Okay.  So let's give it up to Danny.  Narrow casting supervisor.  To all you out there narrow casting,  and to all you out there that are hearing this on a delay,  keep in mind that we know that because our narrow casting supervisor 
[04:08:00]  is checking the pings right now.  He's running shit.  And don't worry.  The show will be available on both Audible and what was the other one?  Ascolix.  Ascolix.  In just a little bit.  Well, thank you, Kevin.  Are you going to be working on the first, also, real quick,  what does Club Show to Kenny do?  He drives Opie and Anthony in and...  Did you interview Kenny?  No, I don't like talking to him.  It's good to know, Troy, isn't it? 
[04:08:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you like talking to Kenny?  He's just kind of mean.  Interns usually don't like Kenny.  Oh.  He's not really nice to us.  He's not.  It's just...  I haven't witnessed Kenny being mean to any of the interns.  I generally haven't either.  He's not mean.  He's just very...  He's not nice.  He's cold.  He doesn't warm up real easy.  All right.  Well, I mean, that's good to know.  Kevin, I appreciate you going to all the trouble.  You did a great job.  All right.  Thank you.  So let's give a...  Friday's show was rough for Kevin, but Monday's show, I think we're starting the week off 
[04:09:00]  extremely strong.  I think this is the new Kevin.  I think you getting off the meds is a great thing.  I was really motivated the other day.  Like, I kind of, like, figured out, like, kind of what I would rather do with my whole  thing.  And what's that?  Pretty much just, like, music jockeying.  Oh.  Music jockeying.  Like, I realize that I know a lot more about that than I do, like...  You don't think the news department would be for you with some of the facts you were able  to uncover?  I can report on Escalix.  No.  You bet you can. 
[04:09:30]  Well, listen.  You're going to be working on your production piece, correct?  I have already started.  I love it, Kevin.  I love...  And Sal, you're gingerly helping him, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nothing creative?  No, no, no.  I'm just like, what do you want?  Chunking it out.  And listen, don't shine it up too nice for him.  No.  He's got...  This is his work.  It's his thing.  That's, like, what I got to work on.  I got to work on the shining up part.  I got the foundation down.  We have the rest of the week to do that.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Thank you, everybody, for listening.  And we will talk to you tomorrow.  Goodbye.
