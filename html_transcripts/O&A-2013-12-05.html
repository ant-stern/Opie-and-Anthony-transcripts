<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a deep dive into the unraveling of the Ron and Fez radio show.  Opie and Anthony dissected Ron Bennington's frustration with Fez's increasingly erratic on-air behavior, which included crying, pleading to keep his job, and making unsubstantiated claims of conspiracies against him.  Specific incidents were recounted, such as a tense post-Friars Club dinner with Tim Saion, a failed attempt to get Fez's cat to say "cookie," and a tearful Mrs. Fields cookie live read.  Clips from the Ron and Fez show were played, illustrating the escalating tension.  Listener calls added perspective on dealing with similarly difficult individuals.  The hosts vehemently denied any involvement in Fez's situation, speculating on potential underlying mental health issues and a codependent relationship with Ron.  The discussion was punctuated by profanity and frank commentary on mental health and interpersonal dynamics.

The show then shifted to more general concerns about Fez's well-being, noting his transformation from an extroverted personality to a withdrawn one.  The hosts offered advice, including the "act as if" strategy, sharing their own experiences with professional setbacks and humiliation.  This transitioned into a humorous yet exasperated rant against ShareBeast and other deceptive online advertising tactics and clickbait links.

An internal staff discussion ensued, focusing on the absence of a colleague, Travis, and the perceived lack of preparedness by other staff members.  Accusations of insufficient work ethic were countered with explanations of completed tasks.

News segments covered Rob Ford's crack cocaine scandal and the discovery of 400,000-year-old human DNA.  Anthony cracked a joke about having "Adorable, Huggable Boy Disorder."  Banter about Little Richard and the term "femmy" followed.  Upcoming guests Susie Espin and Tom Rhodes were briefly mentioned.

The next major segment focused on Martin Bashir's firing from MSNBC for his controversial comments about Sarah Palin, sparking a debate about journalistic integrity and bias, using highly offensive language.  The hosts compared this to other instances of on-air controversies involving figures like Alec Baldwin, drawing comparisons between different news networks' standards.  This was followed by a discussion about the *Fast & Furious 6* marketing campaign following Paul Walker's death, comparing its tone to the media's treatment of other deceased figures previously featured on the show.  A humorous interlude involved playing a music video by an amateur artist named Julia. A news story about a Kenyan man sentenced for bestiality was briefly mentioned.

The show continued with a discussion of the Kenyan man sentenced to 10 years for bestiality, focusing on the details of the case, including the goat's court appearance and the man's mitigating circumstances.  This segued into Justin Bieber's graffiti in Rio, interpreted by some as racist blackface, and the Gold Coast mayor's offer to Bieber. A hotel's counter-offer to keep the graffiti was also mentioned. A discussion about the board game "Boulder Dash" followed, along with speculation about stranded whales and their perceived laziness. More conversation about Justin Bieber, contrasting the media's portrayal of Jay-Z with other rappers ensued, and the hosts shared their differing views on interacting with transgender individuals. A caller's story about a friend's encounter with a transgender person prompted a discussion about the hosts' and guests' experiences with transgender individuals, including opinions on physical appearance and sexual encounters. Guest DJ Who Kid showcased an expensive gold necklace. The segment concluded with plugs for the Opie and Anthony podcast and Jimmy Norton's stand-up shows.

The final segment began with a discussion of Dwayne Wade's fashion choices and criticism of VH1 for allegedly exploiting the Black community through conflict-driven reality shows. This led to a comparison of reality TV shows featuring white versus Black casts, contrasting the perceived manufactured drama in shows like *Real Housewives* with the often more genuine conflicts in shows like *Black Ink Crew*.  A significant portion focused on one host's experience getting a large tattoo of the Haitian flag on his back at a *Black Ink Crew* tattoo parlor, including the pain and the presence of a baby; the event was filmed for the show.  The conversation shifted to the gentrification of Harlem and Brooklyn, and concluded with a discussion about Kanye West, his personality, career, and perceived struggles with fame and insecurity, including one host's anecdote about encountering Kanye before his fame. A Steven Singer jewelry commercial break interrupted, and the show ended with plugs for the hosts' social media, upcoming appearances, and a mention of a previous guest's "meltdown."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Alright, good morning everyone.  Hola!  We were just discussing the Fez thing before the fucking show.  Oh my god.  A lot of different opinions in this room.  You know, I speak from a place where this sounds way too familiar. 
[00:00:30]  This me, me, me.  Narcissism.  Oh my god, I'm heated up.  Heated the fuck up.  I think we're all on the same page here.  If you didn't hear it, Ron and Fez had an amazing radio show yesterday.  Because Ronnie's showing that he's kind of had it.  Oh yeah.  With the situation at hand.  Which is that he does a radio show with a guy that doesn't really speak anymore.  Which is...  And Ronnie is the one... 
[00:01:00]  Almost sitcom-ish.  Ronnie is the one that is sitting there and, you know, he's the one that's not sure what  he wants to do with his future in radio.  Right.  And some of the options that are milling around in his head is to fucking just walk away.  He's either walk away or just reinvent himself.  He wants to, I think, take a ship down to the Panama Canal.  Yeah.  And just be...  Work on a ship.  And then you got Fezzy, like, begging and pleading not to do what's going to be done. 
[00:01:30]  And Ronnie's sitting there like, there's nothing that has been decided.  And Ronnie's so fucking faithful to Fez.  Way more faithful than I would ever be with anyone in my entire life, by the way.  Ronnie is more than willing to bring Fez along to whatever the fuck the Ron and Fez show  becomes.  Yeah.  So it was sort of sad when Fez cried at first.  And then I was sitting there going, enough already.  Because that's going to affect what Ronnie's thinking.  It was... 
[00:02:00]  I was saying it was sad in a movie way.  Like, when somebody says something like that...  Right.  Because he was literally weeping, begging Ronnie not to change anything with the show.  Right.  And...  But he thinks that the people down the hall are making those decisions.  Right.  And Ronnie, I don't know how many times he could tell Fez, is telling Fez, no, this is all  me.  Right.  I don't know what the fuck to do anymore.  Because he's really frustrated.  He said it in that hour yesterday where he doesn't want to come in day after day and 
[00:02:30]  think the whole world, there's something wrong with the entire world.  Yeah.  He wants to just have fun.  He wants to do, like, pot talk like he did growing up.  Yeah.  Where he wants to just shoot the shit and have fun every day.  I think Fez knew more than he lets on that it was Ron.  I think deep down, like, the idea of saying, hey, look, it's almost like they're both talking  about the same thing.  Right.  But using down the hall.  And I don't think he's lying, but I think they're both using down the hall to avoid going, 
[00:03:00]  look, I know you.  Oh, face to face.  Like, yeah, I think deep down he knows.  But the problem is Fez doesn't listen to anybody, anybody, including the guy that has had his  back for, I don't know, how long have they been doing it?  20 years as well?  Yeah, a long time.  Holy fuck.  And then him crying like that, as a human being, of course it affects you, but it also gets  in your fucking brain.  And I hope whatever Ronnie's thinking, he stays strong.  And I love Fez. 
[00:03:30]  I do love Fez.  And I saw Ron and Fez do amazing radio over the years, amazing shit.  Oh, yeah.  But the fact is, Fez has tapped out.  And he needs to do something.  He needs to get real help for himself.  He needs to walk away from radio for a little while.  I don't know what the fuck.  Maybe that's the answer.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm no shrink.  But Ronnie's not going to throw him out the fucking window.  Ronnie has never been that guy.  I liked the Ron and Fez lawn care service.  That sounded like a good idea.  Right, right. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, Ronnie basically said, if I told Fez I'm going to have a lawn care service, Fez  is that loyal, he would do it tomorrow and just give up radio.  He did.  Because it's not the radio part of it.  It's the Ron and Fez part of it.  Do you think he loves Ron?  I think he does.  Do you think that's it?  I think he does.  Well, Ron ended the show yesterday saying that Fez gave him some kind of Christmas  present that he can't even tell the listeners what it is because it's so, how do you explain  it?  It's so, I don't know how he, not embarrassing, but he didn't know how to handle this present 
[00:04:30]  I guess that Fez gave him.  Personal?  To the point that Ronnie doesn't even want to mention what it is to anybody, including  the people close to him.  But Fez, I mean Fez, Jesus Christ.  You don't fucking listen to anybody, you know, including the people that got your back.  Like, the show is not the same.  No.  And it's finally gotten to Ron.  Yeah, a lot of people.  And it has nothing to do with the company. 
[00:05:00]  A lot of people were calling in, talking about how they used to listen and why they used  to listen, how funny this was and that.  And then Fez would say something like, well, you know, make it sound like that just happened,  you know, yesterday or a week ago.  Right.  Everything was fine up until then.  Right.  It's like, no, this has been years.  And then Ron is basically giving him a laundry list of things he doesn't do on the radio show  anymore.  Right, right.  And Fez, he just sits there, I guess, just staring at Ron. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  I mean, he can help himself.  If he still has it in him, he can help himself by going back and doing some of the stuff that  the Ron and Fez audience loves from the guy.  Yeah.  It all started because they were discussing a steak dinner they had with Tim Savion at  the Friars Club.  And Ronnie and Chris, I'll use his real name today, and I do know the guy.  We just fuck around with all that shit.  Who didn't know?  Uh, they were talking about how much fun it was.  Yeah.  And then Tim Savion goes, I like you. 
[00:06:00]  And Ronnie swears it meant, I like you, meaning you guys.  Oh, boy.  And Fez, he's like, no, he was just talking about you.  And Ronnie's like, what the fuck are you talking about?  And then Fez said he couldn't eat his steak dinner because he sees the writing on the wall.  And Russell didn't like the spices.  It was spices.  And the spices.  It had spices.  He ordered some kind of Cajun steak or something.  And Ronnie had a great line.  He's like, what is this, 1989?  What a tragic comedy it was listening.  I had to listen to the whole show, and it was just tragic and hilariously funny at the 
[00:06:30]  same time.  But Ronnie's like, what are you talking about?  We had a really nice meeting with Tim Savion.  Yeah.  There's enough room for everybody, is what he's saying.  Because Ronnie hinted maybe they should do some separate radio, and then maybe some radio  together.  Yeah.  Like, there's opportunities for everybody.  A lot of options out there, he says.  Christ.  And then I, you know, to make it about myself, I lived that life for many, many fucking years 
[00:07:00]  with my mom, you know, where you have a real fucking issue, a real problem, and then that  person is getting so fucking emotional in your face that you have to tap out and go,  all right, it doesn't matter what problem I have anymore.  Fuck.  It was frustrating to listen to.  Was it?  Because Ronnie, like, you know, really cares for Fez, and always has had his back.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  And then, what, Fez hates cookies or something?  What's that about?  Oh, no.  Cookies makes him cry?  Oops.  That was, uh...  That's his cat thing.  Huh?  He brought in his...  He once said that his cat could say cookie.  Right.  When he prompted.  Oh, right, right, right.  And so they brought his cat in to say it.  And they spent over two and a half hours on the air with Fez whispering cookie to his  cat, and his cat not ever saying anything. 
[00:08:00]  His cat didn't say cookie?  No.  Oh, he never said...  But over two and a half hours.  But that's a great bit.  I heard most of that show.  It was awesome.  It was amazing.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And Fez would come up with all sorts of stuff over the years.  And people were asking me, is this a work?  I've heard a lot of work.  It would be the greatest work in the history of mankind.  I'm 100% sure there's no work here whatsoever, okay?  100%.  Years in the making, if it's a work. 
[00:08:30]  It would be amazing.  Fez had a...  You know, he was closeted, I guess, for a long time, and that's probably frustrating.  But he came out.  Yeah.  And everybody accepts him.  Right.  Like, Fez, if you listen, that's a big thing.  Right.  This quote-unquote homophobic audience or this male demo.  Right.  Nobody cared.  Like, meaning that they liked this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And it didn't affect them liking him.  And I think that he got so much acceptance, and he still saw a lot of people.  He found some negativity, but it's like, dude...  Maybe he can't accept happiness or something.  Because...  Maybe, yeah. 
[00:09:00]  He was happier when he was in the closet, period.  Unless his mental issues, whatever they are, I don't even know, have gotten worse.  I don't think anybody really knows.  I don't think he knows.  But I felt way more badly for Ron Bennington yesterday than Fez when I was listening to  that hour.  Because, you know, Ronnie's had some kind of crossroads in his career.  You know, he's been beaten down a long fucking time.  And he tries to start conversations in bits, and then there's a guy just staring at him. 
[00:09:30]  Well, you know, we've made...  Oh, my God.  We joke about it on the show, because you've got to try to find some humor out of this shit.  Right.  But that wore him out.  So now Ronnie's thinking, okay, I've got to figure out something new here.  And that doesn't mean fucking throwing Fez out the window.  And as many times as he's going to tell Fez that, Fez doesn't hear it.  Mm-mm.  No.  Listening to it, you could hear, like, Ron would say certain things.  Fez was hearing something else.  It was like he was going, yeah, but that was this or that. 
[00:10:00]  And you could see...  It's like, dude, you're not hearing Ron's...  That's what mental patients do.  Yeah.  They never hear you.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Ron started, you know, raising his voice and cursing a little bit.  It was...  Oh, good for him.  It's amazing.  Good for him.  Yeah.  Fuck.  It just hit too close to home with bullshit I've had to deal with over the years,  which I'm, you know, way past, thank God.  Thank the fuck God.  Gosh. 
[00:10:30]  What do you got?  What part you got?  There was some great moments where the analogies would come out and the, like, cliche kind of  sayings that were, Fez would say that were all wrong, like, put a bullet in his pocket.  Right.  How many bullets in your pocket?  And then there'd just be silence and Ronnie would just come back with, that isn't even  a saying.  Dude, there was so many moments of silence.  Yes.  I looked at YouTube, I thought the player hadn't crossed, but I'm like, all right. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  I don't even know what the fuck you're talking.  And then, I don't know, and then, you know, Ronnie did our show recently, and then, like,  Fez had some kind of weird problem with that when Ronnie went and did his regular show.  It was more than a problem.  I mean, he was, like, Ronnie couldn't even enjoy the fact that he just did radio with  us.  Fez cried the whole show on the Friday that Ron did the show.  Because he did our show.  So why didn't Fez come on the show?  Like, I don't want Fez on the show. 
[00:11:30]  I'm saying he didn't even try to come in.  But I don't want him on the show.  Sorry, Jimmy.  It was more than that, though, because Fez said on the air that he was convinced that  during commercial breaks and after the show that we here were telling Ron to leave  Fez.  Yeah, there was that.  We have never, and I mean never, had that conversation.  No, I mean, not one email exchange, but we aside from that.  Ron made it clear that not only had that advice not come from you guys, but he said, in all  the years of knowing Opie and Anthony, I don't think they've ever given me any advice. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I have small talk.  I have small talk with Ron when the mics are off, but we've never had a deep conversation  about that.  And then he's got a comic coming in, and Fez is convinced.  Oh, Tom Rhodes, yeah.  Tom Rhodes is convinced that, like, I guess he's there to replace him.  I feel bad, in a way, that Fez is going through some of this mental shit, but oh my god.  I hope Ron stays strong.  I really do.  I hope he stays strong with whatever he's thinking, which has nothing to do with us or 
[00:12:30]  the company.  Period.  Period.  Yeah, it sounds a little paranoid, like, thinking that, and it's almost like I wish I  could shake Fez and go, like, dude, I know you mean what you're saying.  Like, he means it, but it's not what's happening.  But it's not what's happening.  And it's hard when you're so convinced that something is what it is to all of a sudden  be shaken out of that reality and to know, like, oh my god, I'm seeing this incorrectly.  All these people aren't after you.  They're really not.  It's your own perception.  I don't know how you break through that.  I don't either.  Because there's a lot of mental people out there that just hear it their way and can't 
[00:13:00]  listen whatsoever.  Yeah.  Oh my god, look, the phones are lit with people that deal with someone like that.  I have to deal with a Fez type every day and it's frustrating.  Well, turn the radio off.  Good problem.  He thinks Fez loves Ronnie.  That was one of the things that were going around, you know, one of the theories that  were going around, you know, they've been together as a radio show for many years and  then, you know, Fez is a kind of a needful guy and more than in a paternal way, you're 
[00:13:30]  saying.  Yeah.  I would love to know what the Christmas present was.  Oh.  Yeah.  So do you think...  I would love to know.  In a relationship like that, a friendship like that, where it's, one maybe is more of  a mentor and then they become radio partners, if he loves Ron, and it's not that, oh, he  wants to jerk Ron off.  Right, right.  It's not about that.  I don't think that's it.  It's not about that.  But say he loves...  Is it like maybe he's gotten really quiet, like he's secretly pissed at Ron for something?  Like, you know how when you're in a relationship, something shuts you down with the girl or 
[00:14:00]  whatever for a week or two weeks or whatever the fuck it is.  Is it one of these things where all of a sudden you realize you're pissed off at the person  you're dating?  I think his mind is like a fucking, one of those lotto ball machines just popping around  like constantly.  I don't think he could like think for a second to even think of a response to something, a  funny line.  I think his mind is racing constantly.  I think mentally ill people are, you know, very aware in their narcissistic ways. 
[00:14:30]  And I believe that he's aware that Ronnie's not playing his, his game anymore, that he's  losing Ronnie as far as that shit goes.  And if you think about it, you know, the, the capacity they've been together, like Jimmy  said, I don't think there's a sexual thing that he wants to Ron, but there's a relationship  there that I think Fez sees in a different way than Ron does. 
[00:15:00]  And in a different way, you know, because he's gay, I think he sees that type of relationship  in a different way.  Again, not sexual.  And maybe he knows it's an impossible thing too.  Like when you know you're working with someone, if he feels that way, you're working with somebody  that you have this different feeling for, and you know that you're at the point, as far  as you'll ever go with it.  Maybe that's a frustrating, crazy, I don't know.  That's why we all keep it to just handjobs.  Absolutely.  You know?  Occasionally we'll catch Sam dipping down there to try to get a fucking, what we call the three 
[00:15:30]  helmet lick.  I mean, we're, if we're being blunt and honest today, you know, Fez is lucky that he's here  at SiriusXM because the company doesn't really care about our show and Ron and Fez's show.  So they don't, they don't look at it in a bad way or a good way.  We're just here.  They're a big picture kind of a company.  We're just here.  Yeah.  And if we weren't motivated, boy, could we call this in every day.  And if, if Fez was on regular radio with Ron, he would have been gone at least a year 
[00:16:00]  ago.  They would have put up with it.  Yep.  You got the audio cue to Fez worried about being replaced and Ron losing it.  Yeah.  I figured we'll want to get to the meat of this shit.  Yeah.  And we also had the live read that came after all.  Oh, the, the Mrs. Fields cookie read.  Holy shit.  That's just because he doesn't, you know, cookies makes, makes him cry.  See, I, I, I love Ron and Fez, but I don't listen because by the time they're on, um, we're  off the air and I would go home and go to sleep.  So listening to that yesterday, like knowing the dynamics just from being here was interesting 
[00:16:30]  because I get, I haven't listened to a huge hunk of the show and to hear that happening.  Well, Oh, I know what's interesting.  And it goes to Jim's point about not knowing really what's going on on the show.  The whole thing started because Fez was upset that somebody called Jim's advice show.  Right.  Yeah.  Using the name Todd and giving out all of Fez's problems.  But Jim didn't even know they were Fez's problems.  Right.  Right.  And he was perplexed, by the way, trying to help this guy.  The guy called on my advice show and he was saying something like, I'm Todd. 
[00:17:00]  Did we get that call?  We should have got that call.  Yeah.  Maybe we should get that.  Uh, and, uh, E-Rock's, E-Rock let me know that he was, uh, bullshitting or whatever.  But it was interesting.  I forget what the guy said.  His father hosed him off or some shit.  Oh, yeah.  Out in the yard.  But here's, boy, here's the problem with that.  Oh, boy.  Because I heard it loud and clear.  Fez thinks it's an inside job.  Oh, yeah.  Fez thought that whole thing was an inside job.  That somebody actually called up?  Well, the devious Sam Roberts probably put it together. 
[00:17:30]  But Fez thinks that, you know, it's an inside job, meaning someone that most likely works close to either us or Ron and Fez.  Right.  Even though it's pretty obvious that the guy just listens enough to the Ron and Fez show where he picked up all the things.  He just needed to.  I have the, uh, clip from, uh, Jim's show if you want it.  All right.  Hope it until I get bored and then.  Yeah, but you don't want to.  Oh, Sam, your lies are overwhelming. 
[00:18:00]  We have, uh, Todd in New York has severe anxiety.  You know, it's funny, Todd.  I go through the bouts of this myself, which makes it hard for me to say.  Jim's just trying to help.  How are you?  It's so funny listening to Jim trying to help this guy.  It's probably, uh, a big list partnership, and lately I've just been showing up to work, and I don't pull my side.  You know what I mean?  Oh, I wouldn't know.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  No, no.  Just because of the, what?  Sure.  Just because of the Todd in New York.  You know, I didn't even know Fez's name was Todd.  Oh, okay.  I swear, I didn't know Fez's name was Todd until yesterday. 
[00:18:30]  It's easy to say that now, but knowing what we know, but I don't know.  I think I might have picked up on this one.  Dude, when I see the phone screens, though, and I see one guy, like, drinking, kind of want to kill myself,  and then this guy, with that, this wasn't so outlandish, him saying that he didn't pull his share and his side in the partnership.  Like, yeah, all right, it happens.  There's some damaged people listening to this channel.  There's nothing but fucking creeps call my show.  This guy was, like, the healthiest.  It's a business partnership, and lately I've just been showing up to work, and I don't pull my side, yet my name's still on the business. 
[00:19:00]  Okay.  And my business partners are getting really upset with me.  Sure.  What are you anxious about?  Anything in particular?  Everything.  My sexuality, my mother.  Okay, well, those are big things.  So are you straight, and you think you might be bisexual or gay?  He's trying to help.  I think I'm asexual, but I think I'm gay.  Okay, wait a minute.  So asexually, you're concerned because you don't get the urge to have sex very often? 
[00:19:30]  Oh, gosh.  Right.  Were you abused sexually?  Not really.  My father did hose my ass out in the driveway once.  What do you mean he hosed me?  This guy knows all the details.  He knows all the little bits that have come out over the years.  Did your ass out with a real hose?  Yeah.  Now, why the driveway?  That's kind of publicly humiliating, no?  Yeah, yeah, it was.  So what was the motive of that?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  My father recently died, and I think he might have been a closet homosexual, perhaps a pedophile. 
[00:20:00]  I'm not sure.  Jesus.  Oh.  Oh, is this fake?  Are you joking?  That was E-Rock indicated.  There it goes.  There it goes.  Thanks, E-Rock.  That's what got...  Yeah.  I was annoyed the guy hung up instead of saying, yeah, because E-Rock, I think, was making the thing like...  I kept going, no, it's fake, it's fake.  And then finally, when he said, hose my ass on the driveway, I was like, Jim, it's a fake call.  Jimmy thought you were saying, I want a steak, I want a steak. 
[00:20:30]  So it went on longer.  I'd go for a steak.  I would love a lovely steak.  As long as it's not too spicy.  Yeah, but then, like, hose in the driveway, like, what the fucking spices are?  But that was the, uh, that was one of the triggers that led to what happened yesterday at Rana Fez.  By the way, I don't like that the one clip of my show we play on this show, it has to be me going right to molestation.  Yes, yes.  That was a fair question.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So, here's, uh, Rana Fez from yesterday.  This is where it starts getting, uh, very good. 
[00:21:00]  What does that mean?  I, it does, I don't know what it means.  No, it's all right.  What?  We should find out what they're...  Yeah, yeah.  Please, Sam, find out before you get me back kissed.  There's that dead air and then the Bennington sigh.  Luke, you're on the Rana Fez show.  Yeah, Fez, I won your fat, bratty, old shirt about three weeks ago.  I was just wondering if you want me to send that back. 
[00:21:30]  I'm just sitting in the packaging, and, uh, I was like, you might miss it a little bit.  That doesn't help.  No, keep it.  It's an old, uh, Fez shirt.  Probably won't need it.  Oh, Christ.  What does that mean?  I, it does, I don't know what it means.  Then, when you do know...  I don't know what any of this means.  Well, when you do know, this would be the time to have a conversation.  But to come into some place and...  Are you asking anything specifically?  No, you're not. 
[00:22:00]  You're just saying you don't know what things are.  How could you not know what things are when you sat there and had the dinner?  Um, lady trucker.  Oh, no.  Yes, uh, Fezzy, what are these changes that you think are going on?  It's not your fucking business.  You know, I don't want to put ideas in people's head, and it's really none of your business.  And I wouldn't bring it up on the fucking show, Fez, if it's none of her business. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know what the changes are.  I know Tommy Rhodes is coming in here tomorrow.  I don't know what that's about.  Why is all of a sudden...  I didn't see his name on a booking sheet or anything.  I don't know why Tommy Rhodes is all of a sudden coming in here.  Tommy Rhodes is one of the best fucking comedians on the planet Earth.  He's an old friend of mine.  He's an old friend of ours.  And he's stopping by tomorrow.  It just seems weirdly coincidental.  In what way? 
[00:23:00]  Because I don't know what's going on with me and this company.  Yes, you do.  I was expecting to hear last night.  And the Russians are trying to take over, and the colonel left the messages in the drop box.  But I have to do the mathematics.  What's that from?  Beautiful Mind.  Oh, yeah.  This is like...  Yeah.  Go to Fez's house, and there's just fucking magazines and newspapers stuck to the wall  with threads connecting words. 
[00:23:30]  Supposedly no one's allowed in Fez's house anymore.  Maybe.  Uh-oh.  He announced that on the radio, I think.  Yeah, a couple days ago.  They said Fez stopped cleaning his house, so he doesn't let people...  Getting new radio transmissions from the military!  Did he stop cleaning his house?  That's what he said on the show.  Oh, boy.  It seems weirdly coincidental.  In what way?  Because I don't know what's going on with me and this company.  Yes, you do. 
[00:24:00]  I was expecting to hear last night at the going-away party.  Going-away party.  Jesus.  He's perplexed.  Right back.  Right at this.  Right there, he's just exasperated.  And incidentally, here's the important part that no one's picking up on.  Right.  How about fuck-o Tim Sabian takes this show out for a nice steak dinner at the Friars Club?  I was thinking the same thing. 
[00:24:30]  Tim, how about that?  A bunch of steaks for the boys.  I was thinking the same thing.  We're in this fucking little shitty office down the hall every fucking meeting.  And they're living it up at the Friars Club with this spicy steak.  Laughing.  Laughing their asses off.  Laughing, talking to Jerry Stiller.  Jerry Stiller having their spicy steaks.  Most of them were laughing.  Yeah.  One guy not happy.  We're sitting here in this fucking hovel.  A hovel.  I live in a hovel.  One guy couldn't read the room.  Holy shit.  You want to continue with this?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I just wanted to ask Fez if he feels that he's being selfish, that he would get  mad that everybody around him wants to change things because nothing has changed with him  and they just want to move on.  And, you know, you get mad at Ron and these guys, I don't understand it because it's you  that's, you know, has to make a change for everyone else to feel happy.  Do you want them to just sit and be sad all day while they have to do their job?  They want to be happy too, you know?  I don't think it's selfish to just want to know what's going on in your own place of 
[00:25:30]  business.  Can you pause that real quick?  Yeah, yeah.  That was not even...  In that moment is probably what's the most frustrating.  It's like, that guy asked a legit question.  Right.  Yeah.  And it's like, Fez, it is selfish.  Not to be...  Fez is right there.  To be concerned about what's going on in your place of business is not selfish.  But that wasn't the point the guy was making.  And that's not what's happening there.  That's what he heard.  But that wasn't the point the guy was making.  He didn't even hear the guy talk.  He just waited for him to stop talking.  That was a legitimate question. 
[00:26:00]  That was a very legit question.  You're not fucking selfish at all.  What else could be really going on?  I mean, it's been years now.  So what do you think?  Why don't you fucking ask me, Fez?  Because I'm the fucking person.  All right?  No one down the hall.  I'm the fucking person.  Ask me.  Instead of anybody else.  I don't know if I want to keep hearing bitching every fucking day.  I'm going nuts with it.  I started getting spaghetti against the wall fucking flashbacks.  I was listening to this and I'm like, oh no, daddy. 
[00:26:30]  Daddy, please stop yelling.  Stop yelling.  I got a stomachache.  Oh no.  Just between the two shows, the issues and mental illness that runs rampant through this  fucking room is astounding.  That's what makes for good radio.  Oh my God.  As long as I keep it to fucking gather.  Oh my God.  Fez, glue yourself back together.  Fucking duct tape your shit back together.  Fez, you're still standing.  Like, you just got to start. 
[00:27:00]  It's all up to him.  It's up to you, Fez.  Whatever that means.  If that means taking a break from radio, getting better help, I don't know.  I don't live in his world.  But something's got to change.  When you get the benefit of the doubt from everyone around you for years, you might have  to turn that old viewfinder around on yourself.  Because everybody likes him.  Yeah.  Behind the scenes, we like you, Fez.  We really do.  It's not being polite.  This show is too self-destructive to be overly fake polite to Fez. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  Yeah.  And we like you.  Everybody wants to see you succeed.  So for the constantly scheming Sam Roberts.  Yeah, and the company in general.  Right.  And all that talk.  Down the hall.  But no, everyone's rooting for the guy.  In the halls.  He's still a fun guy, actually.  I see him every day.  He's fucking pleasant.  I know.  He's very nice.  Right, right.  And then, I don't know, something with his confidence when he comes in here.  Yeah.  Continue that clip there, Sam.  Bitching every fucking day. 
[00:28:00]  I'm going nuts with it.  I want to fucking do a show about something.  You haven't jumped into one goddamn topic.  I'm the person you got to fucking beef with.  And you fucking talk around me as if I'm not.  I'm not talking around you.  I'm talking...  I'm fucking telling you I don't know what I want to do.  And I've been up front about that.  And if the people down the hall want to fucking scramble to offer us each some things to do, then that should be a good thing. 
[00:28:30]  But I'm going fucking crazy from the craziness.  It doesn't feel right with them scrambling around thinking of stuff because that was always me and you.  I...  Why would I scramble around to do this with you if you're going to fucking do it with me?  You are unhappy.  I can't make you happy.  Don't blame that on anybody else.  What an odd discussion that you're meant to be having. 
[00:29:00]  If you wanted to do fucking radio again, we would.  But are you doing radio today?  Are we getting into any of these topics?  Or are you just bitching?  See?  Nothing.  This is where I'd look at my radio too.  I thought the fucking YouTube thing...  No one fucking started.  I didn't pause it.  But me.  I started.  It works dead air like no other person.  You mention it and then people come crawling out of the woodwork. 
[00:29:30]  They don't fucking crawling out of the woodwork.  To get between us.  They're saying...  Yeah.  Let's look at some options.  I want to put one point from the outside.  Fez, I love Ron.  We all like Ron.  Yeah.  But let's be real honest.  Nobody is trying to get between you guys to get close to Ron Bennington.  Right.  We like Ron.  Everyone has their own shit to worry about.  They've got their own shit to worry about.  Yeah.  Nobody wants to get between Ron and Fez.  Nobody looks at them and goes, if only he was out of the picture, I could be close to Ron. 
[00:30:00]  We don't think of that.  It does sound like something more than just a professional working relationship based on Fez's end of this.  I mean, you're hearing things that people don't...  They don't talk like that unless they're in a relationship.  Thank you.  You know, it's a...  Well, radio shows, you get really close to these fucking people.  But hearing that, hearing that, you said a tone of that, like getting between us.  There's something different.  That used to be us.  Right. 
[00:30:30]  But it's like nobody's interfering with that.  No.  Nobody's jumping in and going, Ron, you get in this room, Fez, you get in that room.  No one.  But he's feeling that Ronnie has finally had it.  That's where all that's coming from.  And it's a long time coming.  You know, something different needs to be figured out.  And that doesn't mean Fezzy loses his gig.  No.  They don't fucking crawling out of the woodwork.  They're saying, let's look at some options.  Mikey D shows up after years. 
[00:31:00]  Mikey D has nothing to do with anything.  What does that mean?  I've told you before.  But you're on the run of Fez show.  Turn your radio down, dude. 
[00:31:30]  Sorry about that, man.  No, I was just saying that, you know, the Fez is paranoia.  He's creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.  So, you know, if he feels bad things are going to happen, he's creating this himself in his mind.  Dude, I want to learn how to change his mindset.  Because the more you dwell on it, the more it's just going to keep bringing it to people's attention,  things that they might not have thought of.  You follow what I mean?  I was dwelling on it all last night. 
[00:32:00]  That's nothing to brag about.  That's not your fucking job to dwell on stuff.  It's your job to bring up fun topics that we can all talk about.  That's your fucking job.  When's the last time you brought up a topic or got involved in a topic that wasn't negative and angry?  What happened to the fun?  It started to drive me crazy.  Yeah, Roddy loves fun.  And I don't know if it's a self-fulfilling prophecy if something's already been decided that I don't know about. 
[00:32:30]  Dude, if there was something to be decided,  why would you have been fucking invited to the dinner where we all talk?  And so was Chris.  Because this affects Chris's life.  Who's Chris?  Pepper.  Pepper Hicks.  Oh, okay.  Oh, what?  That guy?  Chris and Stanley and Pepper and Hicks.  Jesus, that's five people.  Yeah.  See, but Fess knows something.  That must have been an expensive dinner.  Yeah.  He smells something.  It's almost like you smell smoke in the room and you know you smell smoke, 
[00:33:00]  but he's misidentifying the source of it.  Right.  But the fact that he smells smoke is right.  But it is crazy that he thinks people are talking about him behind his back when he's there for the conversations.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he's in denial that it's Ron who's changing.  He thinks people got in Ron's ear.  Right.  And that's absolutely not true.  That's it.  He's in denial.  Ron's been a fucking saint.  Ron is changing.  And Ron is changing.  Yeah.  But he thinks that can't possibly be true. 
[00:33:30]  There are people talking to Ron.  They're talking in his ear.  And even when Ron came to me and said, you know, hey, buddy, do you want to do a show?  I was like, you know what, dude?  I don't, I don't, I'm not going to be happy with that.  Have fun with that.  Have fun with that.  You're terrible.  Have fun with that one.  Can't wait for later on today.  Ron will have to tell Fess that was a joke.  Well, I don't know if it was.  Where's our Tuesday?  What do we got?  The meeting in his fucking Tim's glass sarcophagus down the hall. 
[00:34:00]  Is that it?  Or do we get steak?  No, we don't get that at all.  They'll probably bring in steak and fucking make them up in there.  Steak.  You know how smoky that room would get?  That'd be great.  I bet you they made him fucking take the drapes off his window because he would pull his slacks  tight and you'd have to like look left or right where his cock head was.  Big ball bag.  Tim's vibe.  He's fucking shuffling some steakums in a pan.  Yeah, we heard your immediate destination.  Stop playing with yourself through your fucking pockets. 
[00:34:30]  Chad and Marilyn, this whole situation started last week when Ron sat in on your show.  Yeah, I want to say that again.  Oh, yeah.  Ron had a really good time, was feeling good about himself.  He was just sitting around throwing the ball around, fucking laughing and joking, all light  and easy.  And he says at one point during yesterday's show, he said, because of course Fezzy was  upset about these guests that he apparently didn't know about that were coming in.  Right.  And Ronnie's like, I just want to talk to somebody.  He goes, I'd have my old lady, the neighbor, come in just so he could talk about something. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  You know, and then he goes on his show and has to feel bad about the fact that he just  did our show.  That's all that was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He likes to do our show from time to time.  Why would that happen if it was being fucking sneaky?  Because I thought something was going to be said last night.  It wasn't. 
[00:35:30]  That's like the fork with the finger of God.  Snap paused.  Yeah.  I'm going to jump out of this fucking building one day.  I'm just going to go to the goddamn window and jump out of the building.  It doesn't even make sense.  Wow.  Lorenzo, you're on the run of Fez show.  All right. 
[00:36:00]  Well, after that, I don't know what to say, but yeah, people are pretty annoying.  The guys that do the inspirational quotes all the time, constantly.  But you got to look in, man, to see the outside world all day, every day.  Yeah.  Well, you get those from a lot of women.  There's women in my family that would like to send me that stuff.  And sometimes I fucking change them up and I would come up with the bad stuff and send it back to them. 
[00:36:30]  Nicky, you're on the run of Fez show.  Hello?  Yeah.  Um, yeah, I just want to say, uh, I started listening maybe a couple of weeks ago and I, I, I thought Fez was the other guy.  I didn't even realize, I mean, Fez does, I guess he hasn't been talking much lately, but, um, so that's worth admitting.  But I also want to say, Fez, you're taking a lot of bullshit, man. 
[00:37:00]  These guys aren't exactly respecting you.  So if you do lose the job, who really gives a shit, man?  Just have fun and be confident.  It's not my plan to get fired.  Look, Fez, this guy's been listening for two weeks.  He understands the dynamics.  I'm Chris, by the way.  I'm not the, I'm the only one.  You better figure out how to fucking explain yourself, too.  Yeah.  You walk around, I'll tell you this, right now, today, you look like the catcher for the show.  Because you got a fucking hat on backwards and you're not in the game. 
[00:37:30]  Calling signals.  You know you're past 30 where you can even get away with that kind of shit.  Yankee fan, let's show it off.  Tries to keep it a little light.  Yeah.  I'm on the Fez show.  Hey, Ronnie, I don't even know how to follow that act that you just laid out there.  But Fez, you should take Ronnie's advice.  The guy loves you to death.  It's put up or shut up.  And maybe you guys take a fucking long lead and get yourself well and figure it out.  Because you used to be funny as well.  Fuck it.  It's really getting tired of listening to it all the time, buddy.  I wish you the best.  There's not a fucking, the option came up that we could take a fucking sabbatical. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know.  A lot of different options came up, which is Fez is acting like negative today.  And I'm telling you something.  Obviously, I wasn't going to come in and talk about any of them until after we're settled.  But the last thing I would do when a vice president from the company says that we like you guys and we want you to feel good about yourselves.  And if you need to take time off, six months or whatever, I get it. 
[00:38:30]  You've been doing radio a long time.  And the last thing I would do is come back and shit on that person and disrespect them by acting like something else is being fucking held back.  That sounded like he just wanted to get me out the door.  Oh, Christ.  And I wasn't going to give into it.  Give into what?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, boy.  Guess what, dude?  This isn't about you.  All right?  For once, it's not fucking about you. 
[00:39:00]  It's about me.  Huh?  And that's why I didn't fucking go in there and say, I want you to fire Fez.  I know you would never do that, but I don't know what other things are operating around here.  God damn it.  Hit play.  Sorry.  Charlie, you're on the run of Fez show. 
[00:39:30]  Hey, Ron.  You're just wasting your breath, man.  He's not listening to one thing you're saying.  Bravo.  No, he's not.  Whatever the expression is.  Hearing you, but not listening.  Whatever that stupid expression is.  He's hearing your words, but he's not listening to anything you're actually saying.  Wrong dumbbell.  Listening, but not hearing it.  You're just wasting your breath by even getting mad or whatever.  I feel bad for you, man.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Play.  Play.  Play. 
[00:40:00]  You know, it's playing.  What?  It's not paused.  It can't be.  It's radio.  I should be understanding.  If you were at that dinner last night, not even a meeting.  Yeah, it was.  A very nice dinner.  It was really a great night.  Fun night.  Yeah, it was really fun.  I thought...  How could anything negative have been taken out of that night?  I thought it was a pause.  We were basically there with what I consider the mayor of the friars club.  It was like showing up at a Catholic place with the Pope.  Tim.  We had a blast.  Is there a lot?  I guess.  Fuck him.  I want to go.  That's so many cool people.  It was really just a fun, fun night. 
[00:40:30]  I mean, this is really long.  I mean...  Yeah, and we can go on.  Dude, I really...  You get enough of it there.  But now you've got to go to the cookie read.  And then you've got to go to where he's begging for his job.  Ron had a very funny...  Which is an hour into this.  He still isn't listening to what Ron is saying.  And now he's basically begging for his gig.  Oh, when he's saying it should be me and you or whatever?  Oh, gosh.  Where he's like just pleading.  Don't change it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When he finally pulls the mayonnaise, you know? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Don't you!  Right.  If you turn up the computer, we can play the...  The cookie read?  The cookie read.  So, I don't know.  But then they went to break a little later on in there.  In this discussion.  Because we're not going to play the whole thing.  It's really long.  Yeah.  The clip is online, though.  I tweeted late last night.  Go to my Twitter or...  Yeah.  You can find it, whatever.  When he brought...  Oh, I'm sorry, Jim.  I said you can go to jimnorton.com tours and see it under there.  When he brought up the blueberry thing. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  And he's talking about, what is it, like scription?  Yeah, it's like a Bible, everybody.  And Ronnie just...  It's just a funny moment.  I know.  We all fucking bomb and get ourselves in...  Yes, yes.  ...a weird position when you do radio.  And then it's exploited.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  He wasn't the blueberry guy every day.  We used to do a bit called Bombs and Flubs.  Oh.  Where it was a million blueberry moments. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  But he can't take that.  He can't take that.  The blueberry thing has become something.  I don't think he likes the blueberries.  So they're in commercial break and Fez's got to do a live read and this is how it went down.  What if Mrs. Fields herself offered to set up a shop in your kitchen, not to only make  all the cookies and treats you could possibly imagine, but then also offered to wrap them  up and carefully place them in a minute.  Just pause for two seconds.  This is what's amazing about this, too.  If somebody was acting, this would be Academy Award winning. 
[00:42:30]  Because it starts out, you can tell he's a little upset, and as it goes on, it gradually  and subtly, you could tell he's getting more and more upset as the read goes on.  Right.  And to the point where he's sniffing and crying.  And carefully place them in amazing gift packages.  Then hand deliver them to all your friends, family, and clients.  Would you be interested? 
[00:43:00]  Well, of course you would.  Well, mrsfields.com essentially offers this exact same service.  It's with a few less amazing aromas filling your house, but still, you get the point.

[00:44:00]  He held it together fairly well, though.  Have you ever, though, ever, in your whole radio career, life, listening to radio, ever  heard anything like that, aside from the Hindenburg crash DJ guy?  I mean, that is, there's just something going on there that's, like, beyond anything I've  ever heard in my life.  Yeah.  It's a sad cookie read.  When they came back, somebody said something about cookies, and Ron said, you don't have 
[00:44:30]  right when they came back from that?  When they came back, he's, like, talking about the cookie, and the guy goes, I'm not getting  those cookies, that's very sad.  Ron goes, it's not mrsfields, it's a fine cookie.  You're not a fine cookie.  He calls them fine cookies.  Fine cookies.  Trying to save the sponsor.  It's a fine cookie.  People are not going to forget mrsfields' cookies anytime soon.  It's way better than just a fucking straight-ahead read.  Oh, my God, is it?  Oh, please.  People are talking about those damn cookies now. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  So now this is where Fezzy, this is the meat of it, where he just begs for his gig, right?  Yes.  And I'll be honest, well, I'll just play it.  It was a little sad, even though I was...  It was sad at first.  As a human being, it's got to be sad, but then I turned quickly and said, enough already,  because, you know, this is going to get into Ronnie's head, and Ronnie needs to figure  some shit out.  Go ahead.  But I got to where I was really enjoying listening to you guys.  Besides just asking, I don't know if it's a bit. 
[00:45:30]  I don't know if he's gone mental.  It's ridiculous.  Listening to that commercial, I literally just wanted to smash my radio.  Oh, that's not...  He's got to figure something out.  I don't know if this is the best place for him to be anymore.  What happened?  I didn't think the video's still playing.  The show's still playing.  Oh.  Seriously?  Yeah, yeah, this is...  I'm sorry, I was just getting emotional during the...  Yeah, we were all aware of that, and you were emotional during the entire time. 
[00:46:00]  I'm just going to throw this out there.  Oh, no.  Please, Ronnie, don't change anything.  Please.  Oh, even Christ.  I'm just asking you.  It's been a long time, and I'm just saying, Ronnie, do not do this.  Don't let them do this to us.  Fez.  Don't do it, Ron.  Fez, can I just say something to you?  I literally...  You don't let him change this.  Oh. 
[00:46:30]  That's great.  I prefer angry Fez to this.  I prefer angry Fez to this, he says.  Don't do it.  I'm just...  I don't know how else to put it out there.  This is going great.  Don't do it.  Can I just ask you to do something?  Have some respect for yourself, dude, and for us, instead of this.  Oh, M-G.  Yes, John Montone. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, M-G, indeed.  This is what everybody wants.  Everybody wants to do it.  Okay.  Everybody wants any of this.  Don't let them.  Don't let them.  I was only joking.  Oh, my God.  He started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop. 
[00:47:30]  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  Be more funny.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Oh, no.  That's going to be a problem.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Ah! 
[00:48:00]  Ah!  Oh, it feels good to laugh.  Oh, no.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, no.  Okay, terrific.  That's an attention getter.  I'm scared.  Oh, no.  It's still playing. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This ain't happening.  Oh.  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  Oh, no.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  Don't you. 
[00:49:00]  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nothing else.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  Oh, no.  Turn it off.  Turn it off. 
[00:49:30]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off, please.  Is this real life?  Put the fucking lotion in the basket. 
[00:50:00]  Shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, goodness gracious.  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole. 
[00:50:30]  Still dead air over there, huh?  Yeah, I haven't paused yet.  Jesus.  Fuck, it's idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  Damn.  Ah.  Hmm.  Yeah.  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays.  I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still tapping.  Oh, that's funny.  That makes sense. 
[00:51:30]  What would management say?  Oh, my God.  I've got to say, there's a lot of people in radio smarter than you two, but there's nobody better at doing that.  Oh, my God.  John, you're on the Runa Fez show.  Oh, there you go.  A lot of dead air.  John, don't have you, buddy. 
[00:52:00]  Dave, you're on the Runa Fez show.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, you remember the Afro show, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so, me and my buddy, this was about five or six years ago, we were both in a 3% agreement  that when it came to that show, the funniest guys were Ron, Anthony, Fez, Opie, then Earl.  Now, we're in agreement that the funniest guys are Ron, Opie, Anthony, Fez, Earl. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, I dropped a notch.  Sorry, buddy.  That's great.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  It's the same thing.  Earl was never in an Afro show.  I don't know who the we is also with this committee.  He's a committee.  See, they're keeping it light and fun.  Yeah.  Now what?  Is that it, or does Fez come back again?  I honestly feel terrible, obviously. 
[00:53:00]  I honestly feel terrible, obviously.  We have all these funny things that people wrote up on the thing about the toenail bit yesterday,  but I think it would be crazy to read them off now.  I know, they're hysterical.  But the...  Yeah, then they go into their...  Is that about it?  Yeah.  Does Fez come back?  I think he does. 
[00:53:30]  A little bit.  You get the point, I guess.  After that, you know, kind of lost it there.  Yeah.  That was like almost an hour in.  Yes.  An hour of Ronnie basically saying that there's no shit going on down the hall.  It's all him.  And Ronnie's trying to figure out what he wants to do.  And no one is influencing his decision.  It's just all in his head.  Fez decided to completely ignore all of that.  And then have the huge breakdown, please don't do what they want to do. 
[00:54:00]  If Fez started talking more and really kind of coming back a little bit and doing some bits,  do you think that Ron would be so happy just to have him back doing his...  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  He doesn't want to walk away from that.  No.  He wants to do the Ron and Fez show.  He wants to do the show with Fez, but Fez isn't there anymore, so...  That was...  But the whole like...  Anyway, when he just started losing it like that.  Oh, my God, that's crazy.  Because I do like the guy a lot.  And you see him in the hall, and you're right, that he's comfortable. 
[00:54:30]  It's like you think you're talking to a confident guy.  Yeah.  But you're right.  Something happens when he comes on the air where it just seems to...  He loses his confidence.  Yeah.  Here we...  Yeah, we got Steve the therapist, this idiot.  Hi-ya.  Hey, Steve.  He's fluid in his mustache.  Down on the couch.  He needs some tissues.  Absorbs fluid from guys.  Yeah, maybe a doctor like me birthed him and stretched his head out a whole lot  and then crammed it back in with a crowbar so I didn't know what I was doing.  Go ahead, Steve.  Good morning. 
[00:55:00]  It's the attention-seeking idiot.  Oh, you heard that?  Sorry.  I wasn't supposed to hear that part.  Oops.  Hi, Steve.  Good morning.  This is what I think is what's going on with Fez.  It's no secret he's had his behavioral health issues.  I believe I heard him say he's on medication.  The problem is this time of year, with decreased sunlight, a lot of people's depression gets worse.  And then there's...  Oh, drink some orange juice.  Or milk, whatever the fuck. 
[00:55:30]  Look at the sun when it is out.  Oh, Christ.  As a matter of fact.  Although Troy does have a light.  Troy's got the light.  He's got the happy...  You know what?  I've got to retweet the happy light fucking video with Jim Norton.  I have a happy light, too.  It's in my office.  Yeah, do you?  For an hour.  It's cool.  It's a train headlight.  Why didn't we have this shit, you know, when we were growing up?  I don't know.  We went outside.  We got a little sun.  How about we stop inventing shit? 
[00:56:00]  Well, that would be terrible.  We just...  No phones.  Well, but as a human race, we just invent excuses for why people can be just fucking miserable and sad.  I think we develop better insight and can diagnose things more accurately.  Oh, you think that's taken from your professional fucking side of it?  You know, I can't help it.  I was diagnosed with...  You think I'll use that as an excuse?  Yes, and then they never really do what they need to do is get their own shit back together. 
[00:56:30]  And then the acronyms aren't even good enough, so they've got to add a letter in front of it.  Right.  Like ADD used to just be ADD.  Right.  And now it's H-T-L-M-L-K-D-L-T-D-T.  I get we had to diagnose some shit, but I think now we're getting into too many subcategories.  You're not allowed to just be down in the dumps anymore.  Oh, no.  What's the reason?  Your kid can't just be an asshole.  Right.  Well, I was diagnosed with AHBD.  That's difficult. 
[00:57:00]  What's that?  Adorable, huggable boy disorder.  Oh, I see you're cured.  Yes.  Oh, is that fucking quick?  Oh, you still have to shrink.  Hold on a minute, sir.  I'm laughing at the fucking, the brilliant quick line that Anthony just fired out as he was digging in his nose the tissue. 
[00:57:30]  That's the beauty of that is he's literally just blowing his nose and that's shot out.  I spent eight minutes trying to figure out letters and he's fucking pow.  Wow, is that quick.  After this caller, can we just hear the lightning fucking speed of that?  Go ahead, sir.  Yeah, the shrink is back on the phone.  Yeah, go ahead.  For Fez to feel better, all he should really do is score a pair of tickets to Jimmy's upcoming show in New York. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, Christ.  Sir, it's not about that.  Oh.  The 20th and 21st.  It's not about that, please.  Summarize, Fez.  Go ahead.  In summary.  Fez is wrung in total by his insecurities and anxiety.  And it seems to me that he's probably got a very unskilled therapist who is just about keeping him in therapy with minimal progress for the bucks.  I don't know about that.  I don't think you can blame the therapist.  Therapists can only do so much, as you know, sir. 
[00:58:30]  And I think they've changed the therapist he has.  I don't know personally what's going on with his therapy or anything.  But obviously, he needs a little more help there.  Yeah, absolutely.  I feel bad because I remember the old school Fez.  That's the worst part of it.  You remember old school Fez back at NEW and the early days of Sirius and stuff like that.  And it's like, oh, my God.  That's the same guy?  You go from such an extroverted, fun guy to this introverted just like... 
[00:59:00]  And you're like, what the fuck could have happened there?  I think that...  I think Fez...  This is my idea.  I think Fez...  This is going to sound trite.  You should just...  Uh-oh.  Act as if.  Oh.  Meaning, I know you feel like everything is fucking done and finished.  Come in and just act as if things are okay.  And it's...  Sometimes that does help.  Sometimes when you start just acting as if everything is okay. 
[00:59:30]  And I don't mean being fake.  Yeah.  I mean, just go on the radio and understand whatever it is.  Fuck everything.  And just talk about the topics.  And just act as if things are okay.  And fuck it.  We're all resolved.  And you might be surprised.  I had to do that once.  I tell you, when they were going to fucking fire me from K-Rock...  And I remember the first show we had back...  Do we have...  Yeah, they were going to fire me.  I had this talk with Minnelli on the phone.  And...  But that had nothing to do with us.  We never heard that.  I'm not saying you. 
[01:00:00]  I'm saying me and Minnelli talked on the phone.  But he never brought that up with us.  It was the people down the hall.  Well, that actually was the people down the hall.  Yeah.  But that never was on our radar.  No, you guys knew he didn't like me.  But I don't think you knew...  I forced his hand.  Kind of like the way Feds forced Ron's hand.  I forced Minnelli's hand.  And I remember going on the air the next day and feeling so self-conscious and humiliated and sad.  But I'm like, you just got to act as if...  And it was actually a really fun show.  And I'm like, just act as if everything's cool.  And it was.  Everything became okay. 
[01:00:30]  And again, I don't mean being fake and a phony.  But sometimes you got to realize that as corny and trite as it is, feelings aren't facts, man.  Just fucking realize that you might be seeing it wrong.  So you're saying management wants to fire Feds?  K-Rock management probably does, yeah.  Minnelli's blaming him.  But no, I think that he should.  And that sounds silly.  But sometimes you can't...  What they say, you can't think your way into good acting.  You got to fucking act your way into good thinking.  Just begin going through the motions and everything.  But Feds is not even going to hear that either.  Maybe not.  But I mean, that's what I would tell him. 
[01:01:00]  It sounds very simple.  He doesn't hear any of this stuff.  That's the major issue here.  Jimmy's advice is spot on.  Jimmy's always got very insightful behavioral health.  Jimmy, I love your advice show.  You're awesome.  But again, I remember that just when I was...  And I was in a much different situation than Fezzy.  But I remember the humiliation and the fucking...  I felt like I was completely alone.  Oh, man.  I really did.  I was sitting there at K-Rock and going on the air.  I didn't want to jump in and talk.  And I didn't know what to do.  But again, it was a rough spot. 
[01:01:30]  But you know what I mean?  Like, everyone hits rough spots.  It's part of it.  It's part of life.  It's part of any job.  And you work through it.  And everything's okay after that.  So Fez, this could be a fucking time Fez looks back on.  In five years, Fez could go, oh my God, what a dark fucking time that was.  I was going through this medication shit and having a hard time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you could do that.  You're not out of the game, Fez.  You're still here.  Yeah.  Stop acting like it's been decided and you don't have the noose around your neck. 
[01:02:00]  You don't.  You right now might be looking up at the executioner's thing, but they have not put the noose around your neck and neither have you.  We're all talking about Fez.  Yeah, but I mean, it's a radio...  That's one of the issues Ron has because he said it.  It's not about you, Fez.  Yeah, that's true.  That is true.  This is all coming from Ron.  But Fez is the one who...  Once again, we all focus on Fez.  Because if Fez changed, Ron is okay moving forward with him.  Right, of course.  You know what I mean?  Ron doesn't really...  With Ron, it's like however much of the situation you can handle is the only thing you can tell. 
[01:02:30]  And Ron's not having the same...  You know, Ron's got different tools for handling this stuff.  Yeah.  Didn't he wrap up the whole thing?  It's not on that video, but it's on another site where they wanted me to sign up for.  Yeah, I didn't do that either.  So I bailed on that.  It's in the description.  Yeah, it's ShareBeast, but don't click on...  Half that shit is spam.  You hit play now and it's spam. 
[01:03:00]  None of that ever worked.  What is ShareBeast?  Those big links that say download and play now.  It's all ShareNow after all that plastic surgery.  ShareBeast.  You could try it.  I tried.  Wisconsin, you're on the run of face show.  Oh, it was that easy, huh?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, hold on.  Pause.  Hold on now, but...  See, but it says download.  Play now.  I clicked all those.  And it's just that tiny little play...  Yeah, what an idiot I am.  No, I did the same thing, dude.  You did, right?  I didn't click anything.  I said nope. 
[01:03:30]  And I went away.  Well, it was clever on their part.  But then I bailed and said, you know what?  I'll never use ShareBeast.  You know what?  It's fucking sneaky.  Another clever, sneaky thing they've been doing lately that I've noticed on Twitter.  If you click on a link that has like, hey, here's 15 pictures of the hottest celebrities  or something.  And they're like, oh.  And they got the first picture.  Right.  And then they got a bunch of links that say next.  Right.  All around it.  Right.  That are big next.  Sure.  So you assume that you click it to get to the next picture.  Right.  And it takes you to some fucking ad site.  Oh, shit.  Meanwhile, the next you need to click on is this tiny little next. 
[01:04:00]  Dude, there's six buttons here that say download.  Yes.  Right.  And I clicked most of them.  None of them downloaded.  Yeah.  And then my computer started like freaking out.  So I said, fuck this.  And I'll never use ShareBeast ever.  It's like three card Monty.  And I recommend everyone out there, don't use ShareBeast.  They're fucking sneaky.  Look at him.  ShareBeast.  Looks evil.  It is evil.  Little horns on him.  He's green.  One eye.  Go ahead.  I just wanted to tell Fez that he's begging you not to do this. 
[01:04:30]  But he's the one that's done it.  You know, it's like that dude that cheats on his chick all the time.  And she finally catches him for the last time and says, I'm done.  And now he's begging, don't do this.  Don't end this.  You know.  Well, if it means anything to you, I just.  I got to know that Fez is down the hall with.  And I'll be joining him shortly.  Oh.  So.  Like children.  Like children.  We can't even finish the show.  Like children.  Who's down the hall with Tim? 
[01:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mark.  I wonder how that went.  Sean.  In Vegas, you're on the run of Fez show.  Yeah.  It is kind of over now.  I just wanted to say, though.  Ron, you've handled it pretty well all this time.  The first show I ever heard was Ron, or was Fez trying to talk to his cat and get the  cat to say cookie.  And I, believe it or not, kept listening from there.  I've loved you guys.  Thanks, dude.  Fez is awesome.  But, yeah, dude.  My heart breaks for him because I know as much as I love Fez when he's on, it's just not 
[01:05:30]  healthy for him.  It's just not.  All right.  Thanks.  He seemed to feel differently.  Fez seemed to feel very strongly that he didn't want the change to take place.  Well, Fez's never been a fan of change.  Garth, you're on the run of Fez show.  Hey, Ron.  Hey, no matter whether I die tomorrow or something changes the show, no matter what, dude, that's  what they say.  Thanks for everything, man.  That's been great.  Thank you, my friend. 
[01:06:00]  I appreciate it.  Exactly.  What kind of cool is that?  I know which option I'm hoping for.  We'll be back here tomorrow.  That much is for sure.  I believe we have Susie Espin stopping by and also the internationally famous Tom Rhodes.  Oh, I heard Tom might be getting a gig here.  Oh.  I don't know if that's ever been to.  Shattered down the hall.  The halls are a buzz.  Coming out of the woodwork.  You want to keep going? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  A lot of comedians out there on the road.  Very few of them play the planet Earth, the way Mr. Rhodes has.  Bob, you're on the run of Fez show.  Man, Roddy, it's been a great run.  You've got a fantastic show.  I used to listen.  I'm trying to drive.  I used to listen to Florida.  He was on FM.  He played some crazy-ass band.  And I'd be out there right at the edge where he loses a signal.  What?  I'm going to the rest area.  It was sitting there next to you. 
[01:07:00]  Something off the rails, shit.  And then all of a sudden, he went off the air when he hit the show.  And it's like, these guys are so fucking whacked out, you didn't know when the show was in.  I think the callers are shell-shocked at this point.  God, H.B. is listening.  They chase you guys in that shit all the time.  I appreciate it, dude.  And, by the way, that was a completely different show than what I do now.  I've, you know, every several years, I honestly believe a human being must reinvent the way that they work.  And that's what I was attempting to explain to Fez. 
[01:07:30]  I certainly feel like the show that he's talking about that we've always done has been like five different shows.  Let's go over to Kevin.  Kevin, you're on the Run and Fez show.  Hey, Ronnie.  I just wanted to tell you thank you, and I'm proud that you finally stood up to that bully Fez.  So, congratulations.  I don't know if I did that.  But, Patrick, you're on the Run and Fez show.  Hey, Ronnie.  I got XM Radio in the special package for a few reasons, and you're one of them. 
[01:08:00]  So, are you gone?  Or can you tell me what's happening?  Is your show over?  The thing is, it's not been a hidden thing that we've been talking to Tim Sabian about doing something different.  That has sent Fez into a fucking dead spin.  Oh, I'm bad. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, I'm bad.  That's well-timed.  Fuck ShareBeast.  I'm serious.  You can probably get this audio.  But I said it to Greg Allman once.  What a pathetic fucking company ShareBeast is.  I didn't know where they...  In the middle of an audio clip that you're trying to listen to, they pop an add-on that you can't even click out of.  You could go back to it.  Iraq, what do you think?  You didn't hear me when I said it.  Iraq.  What did you say?  You got that, Iraq? 
[01:09:00]  No, I was dealing with something else.  What were you dealing with?  I have to ask.  What was going on back there?  We were just going over timing something with the log.  That's all.  Were you on your back and she's squatting over you?  Was he dealing with something, Sam?  I don't know what he was doing.  Timing something with the log.  I didn't have a clue.  He wasn't listening?  No, not for a second.  Iraq.  Like, I was... 
[01:09:30]  In my dumb mind...  This is a crazy house.  It really is.  I was thinking as soon as we even started talking about ShareBeast, he would have been on there like,  oh, let me just in case find it in the system.  Right.  ShareBeast stinks.  But then we played it from ShareBeast anyway, and then I go...  I go subtly, I'm sure we can play it out of our system.  You got the clip?  And we talked for minutes.  Oh, he's got...  Oh, no.  I don't have the clip that he has there.  Why?  The log.  You just went to that.  I didn't have time to go through the whole thing.  I have your other clip ready to go. 
[01:10:00]  You don't have time.  It was just at the end of the show.  It was a quick wrap-up.  So you go to the end of the round of the show.  The other clip I did ask for.  Yeah, I have that sitting here waiting to go.  Okay, we can hold that one, but how about the one Sam is doing?  Right.  I'd have to cut out of this one, because this one isn't saved.  Well, just save it.  Then do this.  Take a few seconds.  Bada-beep, bada-boop.  He wants to talk.  Depending on what year.  He's working on logs.  All right, go back to this, Cher-Beast, and hopefully they'll give us another pop-up.  Horrible, horrible fucking sight. 
[01:10:30]  Not to blame Fez, because it's my own responsibility, because I just feel like I've been worn down.  And I purposely, people brought up about when I went in to do ONA, I really wanted to see if I could play fucking ball on that level still.  You know what I mean?  That I could walk in as a fast team and be able to fucking play.  And that was really, really fun.  Fucking MVP.  What is he talking about if he could still play on that level? 
[01:11:00]  But it doesn't mean anybody hates anybody, or doesn't like anybody.  Well.  Millie Hatchett just wrote, please don't break up with us.  I'm almost sobbing at my desk.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold yourself.  Didn't Millie just win the other day?  Yes, she did.  Nice.  Millie Hatchett.  She's got some Jimmy Webb sign going towards her.  Sounds like somebody's going out a winner.  Some good laughter. 
[01:11:30]  Millie Hatchett's always been great.  I do.  I go back to D.C. with her.  That's wild.  Toenail winner is just in the wind.  Jack, you're on the Run of Fez show.  Hey, remember at the end of the, I'm sure you do, at the end of the Godfather when Tessio knows his gig is over,  and everybody backs away from him?  And Tom Hayden says, no, I can't help you this time.  I think it was just the opposite.  I think it was like watching the brother-in-law kick the fucking window out on his way. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, that was a move.  But it was like, that dude knew it was over, and yet he had an enormous amount of self-respect and just kind of shrugged his shoulders, and that was that.  Yeah, Tessio did it the right way.  Tessio went out like the fucking brother-in-law with the kicking out the windshield.  Alan and Tulsi, you're on the Run of Fez show.  Hey, listen, I've been listening to you guys for 12 years, called in a few times, always positive.  This has by far been the best day of radio. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, fuck that guy.  I've been to hear you finally, well, not finally, I know you've been doing it for a while, but just to really state your opinions in concrete, and it's just, I want to thank you for everything, man.  All right, Alan, let me say this, though, and I know I've got to go in just a second, but if that was true, then why does it feel so fucking awful?  Oh, oops.  Then everyone's saying, oh, somehow just stating the truth is better, but I can tell you from experience that nothing feels that fucking bad. 
[01:13:00]  My humble opinion, because he was manipulated by Fez.  That's why I feel so fucking bad.  Just my opinion.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Fez's got into his head.  That's what those people do with their craziness.  I am, um...  Ronnie, you should stay strong.  I don't know if he wants to hear my two cents, but stay strong.  You know what you got in your head and what you need to do, and I know you're not a bad guy, and I know you got Fez's back, but fucking stay strong.  That is my advice today.  You know exactly what you want to do, so do it. 
[01:14:00]  Uh-oh.  But you got to stay strong.  This is going to fan the flames.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  I really don't give a fuck.  I've dealt with this my entire life, because I know these fucking crazy people get into your head, and then you're like, okay, I guess I could deal with this a little longer.  All right.  When you know in your heart what needs to be done.  And to Fezzy, Ronnie still has your back, even though he's going through major fucking changes in his head.  God.  Play.  I'm going to be back in here tomorrow. 
[01:14:30]  Susie Espin will be a guest.  Tom Rhodes will be a guest.  Um, the initial thing was that we were going to get something together, and I got to go down and figure out what's going on with, um, Fez right now.  Let's see.  You know, we were going to do this a little more.  Is that it?  Maturely, a little more like adults.  We will be back here tomorrow, though. 
[01:15:00]  That's a promise.  And we'll see you then.  And that's the end of my show.  Donk.  No.  Well, he has to go down the hall and deal with Fez, even though this is all Ronnie and what's going on in Ronnie's head.  Got to go down there with Tim Sabian.  Right.  Have a little chit-chat with the three of them, I'm sure.  That was comfy.  I'm sure.  I'm sure at today's show, when the comedian friend comes on.  I don't think anybody will be listening to that show. 
[01:15:30]  I'm comfy.  Oh, I disagree.  You think at this point, Tim's like, what the fuck did I get myself into?  He's got two miserable shows that don't believe in this place anymore.  Have fun.  Have fun, Tim.  Trying to figure this out and re-motivating everybody.  You got them spicy steaks, though.  Because this place fucking kicked us down, down, down.  Yeah, Tim.  How about you take the crew here out for a fucking pepper-laden, shitty steak?  Yes.  I'd love a nice spicy steak with my pal Tim. 
[01:16:00]  Oh.  I liked him.  Yes.  His giant head.  I miss him.  Take me out for a steak, I'm going to fucking jerk you off.  I know what the present was, by the way.  Fez gave Ronnie a Christmas present.  I wish you found that part of the tape.  Eric?  You got that, Eric, maybe?  No.  He states matter-of-factly.  I love it.  But, Ron, he said that the president is so, I guess the president made him so uncomfortable 
[01:16:30]  that he doesn't want to tell anybody, although he brought it up on the radio, so I think eventually  what happens with radio shows, and most of you people are pretty knowledgeable now, if  it's brought up on the radio, eventually it gets out there.  Sometimes you can't do it right away for whatever reason, but I think eventually Ron will tell  his audience what Fez gave him for Christmas.  A Christmas present.  On December, what?  It would have been like second or third?  Yeah.  So it's a weird time to give a Christmas present.  I think it's a promise ring. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  I think it's a promise ring.  Do you think it would be something as personal as a ring?  I think Fez gave Ronnie a promise ring.  Oh, man.  Or remember that douchey, that half-fucking necklace?  Maybe they both got a half necklace.  He wears half.  Best friends with a heart.  Yeah.  And Ronnie wears half.  Oh, that would be nice.  Would you guys wear them if I got you that?  Hey, hey, hey.  That is wonderful.  I'd put my half on a homeless guy. 
[01:17:30]  There, you're connected.  All right.  We should break.  It's been a while.  We're going to start our show next.  Nice.  Can we hear Anthony's lightning fast line?  Oh, no.  Sure.  You want to do it now?  It's so fast.  Do it into break.  Oh.  Eric, and do it well.  Well, I was diagnosed with AHBD.  That's difficult.  What's that?  Adorable, huggable boy disorder.  Oh, I see you're cured.  Yes.  What's that?  Yes.  Wow. 
[01:18:00]  The OPNT Show.  Wow, it's already almost 8 o'clock, and we haven't even done anything yet.  What happened?  What happened is rice.  Oh, rice.  Where's Travis today? 
[01:18:30]  He's out.  He's out?  He's out.  Everyone step up in his place today?  He had something to do.  It's a loaded question.  Huh?  Why?  Why is that a loaded question?  Yeah, done with one man, and then you figure everyone else would step up.  Sam, comment?  It's a complicated answer.  We'll try it.  We can handle it.  It's a tough question.  It's a complicated answer.  Are you saying you were the only one in the office for most of the morning?  I can speak for myself.  Okay.  What about Sal and Iraq?  Yeah.  Where was Sal?  Sal had a stressful morning. 
[01:19:00]  I feel like Sal did step up, actually.  Sal, there was some channel issues this morning early.  Okay.  And Sal, on his own accord, went and started monitoring the channel early.  Okay.  And had to run back here, had to get on the phone with engineering, had to make sure the  channel was playing the proper thing.  Nice.  I would say Sal did step up.  And what time did Sal get here?  I spoke to him around 5.30.  Nice.  I don't know what time he got here, but he was here working hard at 5.30.  That's nice.  That is nice.  Yes. 
[01:19:30]  And, um, Eric?  Hmm?  Eric?  Sal called Eric when he was taking care of the issue.  What do you mean?  Well, I mean, it was when, with the issue I was talking about with the channel and everything,  when Sal had to get in touch with engineering and, and set the right stuff to go live and,  and do everything that he had to do.  He, he, he got Eric on the old, uh, ring-a-ding.  What time was this?  It's right around 5.30, a little after.  No.  Uh-oh. 
[01:20:00]  Well, I heard a, I heard a, I heard a very, very faint, no.  What is that, Eric?  What's good?  Sal called me, it was before 5.30.  And where were you?  I was on my way here.  Oh.  It's just, it's just, just step on everybody.  Well, it's just traveling.  Well, if you're down a guy, you gotta, you gotta make sure everyone else steps up, that's all.  Well, maybe it was last minute. 
[01:20:30]  No one knew that Travis was, uh.  Luckily, it was a planned vacation day for him.  What time?  Well, yeah, and Travis sent an email yesterday.  Oh.  Yes.  Early.  Oh, no, Travis, yeah.  Everyone knew Travis was gonna be there.  Oh.  It wasn't a last minute thing.  Oh.  Yeah, not only was it not, he said, hey, everybody, I won't be here, here's what I need you guys  to cover for me.  Right.  Eric, dash, Sal, dash, Sam, dash, boom.  Okay.  Responsibilities.  All right, so.  So maybe Eric picked up what he was supposed to pick up.  Yeah, well, it wasn't covered. 
[01:21:00]  Sam?  No, I don't know, I mean, I, I.  Well, what time did everyone get in here?  Oh, boy.  Well, cut to the chase.  Okay, Sal is telling me that the phone call was placed to Eric at 526 a.m.  Okay.  They were on the phone for a couple minutes.  All right, and what, and Eric came down to the office so they could discuss it further?  No, Eric had to say, I have to get off the phone because I'm getting into the tunnel.  Oh.  Oh.  That's not what I said at all.  I don't know why this is being made an issue here. 
[01:21:30]  Oh.  If anything, because you have nothing else to do.  Oh, my God.  Eric, Eric, if they have nothing.  Oh, we got plenty to do.  Yes, don't you worry.  Don't you worry.  If they have nothing else to do.  Don't you worry.  And if we don't have anything else to do, that means because people didn't step up.  Thank you.  Oh, no.  He always does it to himself.  Yeah, okay.  You're using that.  You have nothing else to do.  You're using that as your, as your burn back to us, and that would mean.  What was uncovered that Travis, of Travis's responsibility. 
[01:22:00]  What time did you get here?  I got, I got up here like it was like 540.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  That's a good time.  If you're entering the tunnel at like 530.  You made an amazing time, right?  I'm honestly impressed by that.  If you get up into the building at 540, that's pretty cool.  Oh, man.  If he's admitted to 540, then it's got to be.  620.  6.  Shit.  All right.  Fair enough. 
[01:22:30]  Fair enough.  This is a meat grinder, man.  You're just like, okay.  Fair enough.  Whatever.  Show will be fine.  Doesn't matter, right?  Yeah, I mean.  We'll entertain the people either way.  Hey, and look.  If you want to shit on us as a staff, that's your fault for not having enough to do.  Yeah.  I know.  It sucks that we don't have enough to do.  Yeah, you just don't have the material.  Right.  You just don't have material.  So you pick on me for not being here, getting material. 
[01:23:00]  And of course, we all know getting here at 540, possibly probably 550, there's plenty of  time to get material together for the on-air staff.  So we are wrong.  You have your prep sheets.  You have everything.  So we are wrong.  Yeah.  Once again.  Yep.  How are we wrong?  None on you.  None on you.  None on you.  None on you.  That's the battle cry.  You had your shit. 
[01:23:30]  The staff's job is complete.  Who put the shit together, though?  That's a good question.  Who put the shit together?  Who put the shit together today?  Because Travis does a really good job with the prep sheet.  Who put the bop and the bop-she-bop together?  Travis put a lot of it together from home before.  No.  It's a loaded question.  Why is that a loaded question?  So many loaded questions.  I'll tell you what the prep sheet is.  Okay.  Prep sheet for today.  Sal pulled some articles yesterday. 
[01:24:00]  I pulled some articles.  Sam has your audio.  I put it all together.  And you have it all there in front of you.  The reason I felt it was a loaded question was because Travis puts a news email together  the night before, right?  Right.  And then he gets in here early.  Sure.  And he goes through the stories that he sent last night, double checks that they're still  relevant, and then sees what broke overnight to make sure that you guys have up-to-date information.  All right.  So in terms of just getting stuff together, just printing out the stories that Sally mailed, 
[01:24:30]  and then, you know, it's not just printing the sheet, you know?  Okay.  I pulled articles from today, too.  Which ones?  Loaded question.  They're all loaded questions.  Oh, is that a loaded question?  It's a loaded question.  Which ones?  It's just loaded questions.  Which ones?  It's the girl in Alabama who went missing, and they wound up arresting most of her family 
[01:25:00]  on a pedophile ring.  That was from this morning.  I put that in there.  Yep.  So I keep my little girlfriend a pedophile ring.  No.  See?  It's creepy.  It's on her little finger.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, you did.  What other ones?  The update from Metro North.  What's the update?  I don't even know.  The alarm system that's supposed to let the conductor know when they're getting to a certain  point to slow down for a bend was on the other side of the train from where the conductor 
[01:25:30]  was.  What do you mean, the other side, like the front of the train and back of the train or  the right and left?  Where the conductor was, it was on the far back side of the train, so it wasn't even near  the conductor to alert him.  Why was it like that?  That, I'm not a hundred percent.  Did he move?  He wasn't.  His seat?  I don't know.  Well, you got the article together.  And I openly admit it, I don't know this.  Travis also highlights the articles. 
[01:26:00]  But I openly admit it, and I don't know this, so I'm asking the guy that put the article  together.  That's all.  Yeah, article put her together.  Is this fun for you, E-Rock?  No.  Why would it be?  No, but what, did you read the article or you just printed it out quickly?  No, I didn't.  Like, where was the guy and why wasn't he close to that alarm?  Yeah.  Hold on a second.  He's going to read it.  No, all right.  So the locomotive was pushing the train, but he was in the front watching.  And the alarm system was in the back?  The alarm was in the back of the system. 
[01:26:30]  That doesn't make sense.  The alert system.  Why would that be?  They used the word homicide today in the paper.  I know that much.  Oh, boy.  You don't want that happening.  That was in the headline.  Homicide, they're hinting at.  What does that mean?  That he purposely did some shit?  No, it could be negligent.  Yeah, involuntary homicide.  Boy, you sure don't want one of those jobs where all of a sudden, you know, you just go  to work and, hey, wait a minute.  I'm now on trial for murder. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  What just happened?  Well, he didn't.  Even after the crash, he didn't care.  You see the video of him just walking by the victims like, oh.  Well, they'll say he was in shock, maybe.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Like you're a crane operator and you do something and the crane falls and hits somebody  and you're like, oh, great, now I'm on trial for, you know, my life.  Right.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  All right.  I used to operate a crane.  You did?  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  What other?  I did. 
[01:27:30]  There was a bird in my cabin.  Oh, a crane.  Oh, I see.  That's different.  Do you like that one, Tim?  No.  You mean operate.  I think it makes sense.  Oh, God.  Eric, what other article?  This is going pretty good.  Uh, let's see.  Hurry up.  Stop reading as you're talking.  We need your help.  Yeah, you said you brought some.  Yeah, you're reading the same sheet that I gave you.  But which ones did you, you said you added some stories from today.  So I'm just. 
[01:28:00]  You got the Metro North one and then the Alabama story.  All right.  Tomelo Anthony is saying that the Knicks are the laughing stock of the league.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  They're 3-13.  Uh, stuff from this day in history.  I guess they're playing the lousy Nets or something?  Yes.  Is that like a game that people watch because they both suck?  I guess.  Yeah, they're not doing well either.  It's horrendous.  Nets suck.  Knicks suck.  Islanders suck. 
[01:28:30]  Jets suck.  Nice.  But when Carmelo Anthony said they were the laughing stock, he was kind of like laughing  as he said it.  Yeah, he don't give a fuck.  It's like.  He's so gone after this year, right?  There's a lot of hints that he would go to L.A.  Oh.  But the news was running that soundbite like this was some big controversial thing.  It was just one throwaway quote.  There he goes.  Yeah, he's doing good.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Still don't know about that fucking alert system with the train guy.  Yeah, I couldn't find it.  What happened there? 
[01:29:00]  Do you know that they found a 400,000-year-old human DNA?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I saw that.  The old record was 100,000.  It literally is four times.  That's why we don't know shit yet.  That's far back.  They ought to clone that shit right there.  See what comes up.  That's a good idea.  The amount of stuff they've gotten wrong just in our lifetime, we don't know shit yet.  We have no fucking clue.  400,000-year-old DNA.  Where was this 400,000?  I don't know where it was.  I think they found it in Spain.  Whoa.  Oh, right, you're right.  Oh, hi. 
[01:29:30]  Wow.  Well, you're right.  It was right.  It is right.  You rock.  They were called the Denisovan or whatever, and they just said it fucking changes everything.  It was some rare class of human being that they only theorized existed.  The missing link?  Yeah.  Is it like a missing link?  Love a missing link.  Yeah.  Because before that, I think the earliest sample they had was only like 100,000 years old.  Really?  Cool.  I hadn't heard that.  Wow.  I hadn't heard that before.  Oh, you said it.  I'm sorry.  No, I didn't.  I did not just say that exact thing a minute ago. 
[01:30:00]  You know, it's actually in Spain is where they found it.  Wow.  Spain.  Is it four times as old?  You know, that proves...  We don't know shit.  We don't know shit is right.  It's just the greatest thing.  Just give them a little rope.  I want to do a show, maybe soon, where we just list all the stuff that we thought we knew  in our lifetime alone.  Stuff that prevented cancer, but now they're saying, no, it actually causes cancer. 
[01:30:30]  All that shit.  Smoking.  We come from a time they didn't really think smoking was that bad.  So what does that mean that it changes everything, Jimmy?  The guy said we have to, this one doctor said we have to rethink our whole story, the whole  history, because it was, which is where we were spread out, and I'm reading this as  I'm talking to you, so I don't know exactly, but it was, it really is an amazingly old  piece of DNA to find, and they got it out of a fossil, a femur bone.  Whoa.  Yeah.  There was some fucking bone still, still, is it still enough to have DNA in there? 
[01:31:00]  Is it some cum?  Yeah, it's a load on someone's back, it's on the backbone of a woman.  Of a woolly mammoth?  All those things are not as old.  Now I'm assuming it's fossilized DNA?  Is it just an imprint of a, well, the guy said that, of a strand?  They found, I guess there's a fossilized bone, and they drilled into it, and as they hope  they found DNA, and he said even a year ago this wouldn't have been possible.  It's just this new.  Why?  New technology.  It's technology, yeah, which probably enables, it's getting so much faster and so quickly, 
[01:31:30]  We gotta pull some of that Jurassic Park shit if we can.  That'd be so cool to just clone these animals.  We will.  We're not gonna get to see it, though.  They'll figure it out.  Yeah, you're right.  How cool would that be?  In a hundred years, they said.  You'd bring back a 400,000-year-old human.  It's all this ethical shit, I think.  Oh, we're gonna pass that eventually.  I think we're at the point right now where they could absolutely clone a mammoth, or mastodon  or something.  Big hairy fucking elephant.  I think they could do that.  That ethical shit is bullshit. 
[01:32:00]  Because you're gonna get some rogue guys in a lab somewhere going,  Fuck this ethical shit.  Let's do this and just...  Yeah.  They don't have the funding, though.  Yeah.  Well, they'll find some whacked-out billionaire.  It'll all come together.  Like a supervillain.  Yes!  Oh, I was gonna say, like...  It's not far-fetched.  Like Bruce Wayne, but you're saying the other side.  Oh, no, because these people will use willy mammoths for evil.  For evil?  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  For evil.  For evil.  Absolutely.  I think if you're a scientist and all this shit is going down around you, and you know  you can now do something different that no other human being has ever done, there are 
[01:32:30]  people out there that'll absolutely do it.  Then they're chastised by their...  You think we've cloned a human being here somewhere?  No, I don't think so.  No?  I honestly don't think so.  Maybe people have, you know, theoretically tried little samples of things.  Right.  And then they grow...  They're trying to grow organs.  Things like that.  But they clone a whole human?  That'd be kind of cool.  That'd be awesome. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  You could do, like, The Island.  That movie, The Island.  Right.  Where you clone a replacement for yourself.  So if you need anything, yeah.  Is that what you're getting at?  I heard you.  Oh my God.  I heard you, though.  No, I was saying, if you need any organs...  Right.  You know.  And then they had that guy from the Green Mile, the big black guy there.  Right.  And he woke up on the operating table while they were trying to take his liver out.  Wow.  And it was pretty distressing, because he's on the floor bleeding and clawing on the floor 
[01:33:30]  as they're trying to drag him back into the OR, and he's screaming, I don't want to die!  And now he's dead.  In real life.  You'd have to make them like vegetables.  Well, that was the movie Coma, I believe.  That's how they put people in comas, and they were harvesting their organs.  A lot of organ harvesting movies out there, but this one, they decided, instead of putting  them in a coma, they were going to, like, give them a totally different outlook on what  life is.  Like, oh, it's terrible, like, the earth is fucked, but there's this one place called 
[01:34:00]  the island, and it's paradise and everything.  So if you get picked for a lottery, you get to go there.  So they were all complacent, docile and everything.  And then they go, oh, you won a trip to the island, you're going to the island.  And meanwhile, you know, that means you're going to the OR, because you're the person  that you're cloned off of needs, like, a fucking heart transplant or something.  Wow.  Yeah, that's villainous shit.  The coma thing sounds like, okay, that's at least kind of nice.  It had Eid McGregor.  Oh.  Eid McGregor. 
[01:34:30]  And what's her face there?  That hot fucking piece of ass.  Goddamn with the big tits that we love that had her naked pictures.  Precious.  Yeah, precious.  The girl that played Precious.  Scarlett Johansson.  Scarlett.  The lovely Scarlett Johansson is in that, in a tight little, like, jumper thing.  She's quite the dish.  She looks so goddamn good.  Yeah.  She's a dish.  Yeah.  Who is the picture?  Of Scarlett Johansson?  There she is.  Let's see.  She's wearing, like, a little fucking tight little number. 
[01:35:00]  Mm-hmm.  A couple of twists and turns in that movie, too.  I kind of liked that movie.  The Island?  Yeah.  Not bad.  Got a little re-watchability.  Well, we got more Rob Ford stuff.  What?  I'm sure you know about that as well, right?  What's he doing?  E-Rock?  Got anything on this?  You have the audio in front of your side folder.  All right.  Thank you.  Audio of Rob Ford.  He's kind of going down in popularity. 
[01:35:30]  Why is Sam laughing?  It's just a funny interaction.  Why?  That's a loaded question.  It's a loaded question.  Why are all these questions loaded?  Loaded question.  It's just funny the way that back and forth is handled.  Why?  Well, it's just a real good chemistry there.  Oh, yeah.  Between you and E-Rock?  Yeah.  All right.  Liked it.  News report.  Rob Ford wiretaps reveal.  I just hope people got the subtleties of it.  No, I don't think they did.  He smoked more crack. 
[01:36:00]  So they wiretapped the dude.  And they know he smoked more crack.  They actually...  Than what he's admitting to.  Right, because they have piles of wiretapped conversations that they're now slowly taking  those black...  You know, they put black bars over the stuff that you can't see?  Yes.  Yes.  They're now slowly releasing more and more without the black bars.  And so every time they do that, there's all this great new information.  Ah.  Okay.  Because they wiretapped the gang members that he was associated with.  Oh.  Gang members.  So he hung out with them more than once. 
[01:36:30]  Well, that's what they're saying.  And Rob Ford's saying that's not true.  Yeah, but Rob Ford's saying a lot.  And now this has proven that he might be a liar.  Redacted.  Yes.  That's it.  Redacted.  Try to buy the...  And he tried to buy the video.  They got him on tape trying to buy the video from the homies?  They have on tape the homies saying that he tried to buy the video.  Okay.  Yeah, because why would you try to buy the video?  They could make copies.  They must have laughed at him.  Yeah.  Like the homeboys, they must have just seen this guy and been like, it's clown, motherfucker,  clown. 
[01:37:00]  And they're also saying he did.  A little horn?  A little horn?  A little horn.  The video thing is important, too, because when Gawker first came out and said, we're trying  to buy this video, he said, I don't even think that video exists.  Right.  But what this thing is saying is, before that Gawker article ever came out, he had already tried  to buy the video from the homies.  Oh, boy.  Exactly.  He was trying some Jedi shit.  There is no video.  Right.  Right.  It didn't work.  No.  Rephrase the question.  There is no video.  Yes.  So who are we going to hear on this tape?  It's a newscast. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  Given the details.  Okay.  Rob Ford had nothing to say leaving his office this evening.  Have you done hair on the airport?  Justin.  Oh, God.  And he gets into the elevator doing his laughing, like, what a ridiculous question.  Come on.  Lobby.  Lobby.  Lobby.  Lobby.  It's not shutting.  I want to hang out in that lobby for a week.  Does reporters just hang out and wait for him to leave?  Yeah.  Oh, it seems like a party.  An hour after a judge released more pages from those police surveillance documents that have 
[01:38:00]  plagued him for weeks.  The previously redacted sections are police summaries of wiretap conversations between alleged gang members.  Police began to hear them talking about Mayor Rob Ford.  On March 27th, 2013, Mohammed Syed talked about receiving an offer to purchase the video of the mayor smoking crack.  Yeah.  He said, I'll give you $5,000 and a car.  Syed then suggested the video was worth $150,000. 
[01:38:30]  In interview after interview, Ford said he smoked crack only once.  It's crack while you've been mayor?  Yes.  More than once?  Oh.  No.  This is an isolated incident.  Previous police documents suggest the video of Ford was made in February.  But the new wiretap summaries suggest gang members were talking about delivering drugs to Ford at this home,  which police call a crack house, on April 20th.  Liban Syed tells a friend the mayor of the city, Rob Ford, was smoking his rocks today. 
[01:39:00]  And he said another alleged gang member claimed to have pictures of Ford doing the heza,  a street term for heroin.  The heza.  The heza.  Yeah.  To an heza.  Hair on.  Nice.  Rob Ford on fucking Worldstar.  But I really do love the media and the way they're like,  aha, we know that the guy lied about doing crack more than once.  Yeah, yeah.  Yet no one has ever done crack once unless they died doing it the first time. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Right.  No one.  This is not fucking, you know.  Of course he's lying.  They also said that on the tape, it is implicated that one of Rob Ford's advisors,  because the gang member that allegedly shot this video was murdered.  Yeah.  And apparently one of the people who worked for Rob Ford told the gang members or implied  that, hey, you know, you saw what happened to that guy that shot the video.  But then they said the police report showed that the guy just died in a gang-related incident 
[01:40:00]  and had nothing to do with it.  Oh, okay.  Had nothing to do with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rob Ford's people were just trying to be like, hey, look how powerful we can be.  Look out.  So now what happens with this Rob Ford?  He laughs it off.  He's going to run for mayor next term.  Oh, he's going to run, yeah.  Look, he's lowering taxes.  Yep.  That's all the people want.  He's doing heza, but he's lowering taxes.  Heza.  You know what?  That's all that matters.  He's lowering taxes.  I don't care what he does.  But Pam's man one on Twitter.  I know it's a visual, but I've got to show you guys. 
[01:40:30]  Penny.  Or you go to his Twitter to see what I have here.  Here's Rob Bartlett doing Andrew Dice Clay on Imus this morning.  Look at our Rob Bartlett.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think I looked up and saw that.  Yeah, I just saw that too.  He's doing the new version of Andrew Dice Clay with the gray hair.  The gray hair and the leather jacket.  He had the gray hair for the Woody Allen movie.  And the glasses.  And the glasses.  That is fucking Rob Bartlett rules.  Yeah.  Good pal of ours.  All right. 
[01:41:00]  That's the ladies from Rob Ford.  Damn.  Lots of crack.  Hair on.  Right.  There'll always be stories coming out about this guy.  He's had a checkered past, I guess you could call it.  And present.  And present and future.  Yeah.  He had a checkered Tuesday.  I wonder if there's any chance of him winning if he runs again.  Zero.  You don't think so?  Zero.  I don't think people would be like, ah, fuck it.  No.  They should.  Vote for him for a goof.  Right.  They should do that.  Yeah.  If he did it once, they might have. 
[01:41:30]  But this is, everyone knows there's so much more.  And it's so dirty.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, one incident people can really overlook.  If all of a sudden he had done it once and went to rehab or got help.  And he has time on his side because a year would go by where they know he only did it  once and then he's a good boy since then.  But he's not even trying to lose weight.  He was seen eating chicken wings at the Bills game up there in Toronto this past weekend.  He's an indulgent piggy boy.  Of course.  Oh, he is a piggy boy.  Those are gang members. 
[01:42:00]  He's posing with gang members.  You can't pose with gang members.  No.  You can't even do that if you have a radio show.  Yeah, and a mayor.  You can't be the mayor posing with gang members.  You guys have the middle finger up, doesn't you?  Yeah, flipping the bird at the camera.  Right.  As if to say, fuck you, I'm in a gang and this is the mayor of Toronto.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, that's fucking great.  That's the very gang that allegedly sold him crack.  Right.  And did it with him on video.  Allegedly.  Wow.  I guess there's the goof factor of voting him in and then there's the, hey, I guess the 
[01:42:30]  mayor, we really kind of want a mayor that might get some stuff done.  Then again, if he's lowering taxes...  He doesn't have a shot.  Oh, I know, but...  That'll be his whole campaign platform, though.  It's going to be, wow, you think I lowered taxes last time?  I'm going to really lower them.  Look at my record.  Yeah.  Yeah, do you care?  I mean, your taxes are lower.  Your lives are better.  I know.  I've made mistakes.  I said I've made mistakes.  Haven't you?  Goofy.  A lot of guys have made mistakes and not lowered your taxes, but I did. 
[01:43:00]  And I'll lower them some more, but without the mistakes this time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what he'd say.  That's a guarantee.  I didn't know that you shouldn't smoke crack at my age.  No one told me.  That has not been talked about publicly, that crack might be addictive.  I did not hear one rap song in the 80s.  Oh, so for what it's worth, I was very, very drunk.  Yeah.  I was, as Chip would say, I was zooted.  Oh, zooted, yes.  He loves getting zooted.  He does. 
[01:43:30]  He lives to be fucked up with his tiny ties.  His fucking long and hardy outfit.  Giant head.  It does have a big head.  I don't think anyone has said this yet, but it really has a resemblance to Chris Farley.  You know?  I've never heard that.  You know what?  You have heard that.  I've never heard that.  It's so familiar.  Maybe I just thought it and was too scared to say.  Oh, the banger!  Oh, man.  People said they were thinking about that all day.  Of course they were.  Oh, the banger!  Oh, the banger!  Did you hear people busting Rob Ford's balls about his tie? 
[01:44:00]  Everything.  Yeah.  Because this NFL tie is super old.  All the team logos are from, like, 96.  Oh, wow.  So it's retro.  He said they were busting his balls because he was wearing an old tie.  He can't do anything.  But that's retro shit.  You've got to get people to pass on retro shit.  I don't know.  People love retro.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, we've got the Kenyan man that effed the goat.  Oh, yeah.  And the goat is in court.  The goat is in court.  As they decide the fate of the Kenyan.  Some judicial system they've got over there.

[01:46:00]  would always put us up in that hotel yeah just wander around looking uh go get plastic you'd  come downstairs and get a croissant and go back upstairs yeah yeah he was uh he was creepy to  look at he looked a little plasticky and a bit femmy well yeah he's always been a little femmy femmy  uh i accept the gay the femmy thing is still a rough i mean can we be honest with each other 
[01:46:30]  but uh the gay is all right but i mean the femmy part i'm still trying to wrap my head around yeah  there's nothing i'm gonna do it's gonna hold uh the gay back but i will i'm not gonna get in the  way of the femmy trust me i'm just telling you my personal feelings on the thing it still makes me  uncomfortable the fems don't realize can you call them the femmys the femmys the femmys don't realize  i'm not here to stand in your way right you know many people and we're not talking about you  as relax you're not a family oh boy jesus christ he's in the back of everyone's head all the time

[01:47:30]  an issue or something or or i don't know or he got flagged for being too femmy in an event or something  wow well paper i think the story is that the gay activists right are angered by his decision not to  boycott russia oh right so he called them idiots for being mad at him and now he's why why does he have  to boycott russia because russia doesn't like the gays they give them a lot of time so a lot  about but isn't elton john playing there i'm not sure he's playing yeah they don't like the gays at 
[01:48:00]  all they yeah give the gays a tough time over there but johnny weir is like i got a figure skate and  i got that's where the gigs are i can right what am i gonna do this to put these things on every four  years i can yeah right what do you want me to do waiting i'll sit out for four years wait they're  talking about the olympics yeah the olympics are in russia yeah yeah in 2014 the winter olympics  yeah it was right around the corner is it a 2014 no russia's far 
[01:48:30]  um but yeah so what a lot a lot of gay athletes are boycotting this olympics yeah the activists  would like them to oh you know what go fuck yourself johnny weir only all right now i'm in on the story  yeah you only get every four years to do an olympics of course he's going to go there plus if anything  he'll just be like in russia and all the russians will be pissed and be like fuck you i'm the gayest  dude ever yeah yeah right oh he'll shove it right in their face exactly and we did that once before  the whole boycotting the olympics and you feel bad for the athletes yeah the athletes you know 
[01:49:00]  oh they got sarah palin talking about martin bashir oh that's doing whatever that they can't  just got shit in her mouth oh man world you are going to be hurt and attacks will come your way i don't  i just hope that an attack like that doesn't make people hesitate well you know what one of the things  about his attack is it was scripted it was premeditated we've all said things on tv when  we're at living well not me but go ahead it didn't come out exactly right but this was you know who  cares if it was scripted a chance to review it and they obviously or apparently all agreed and rather 
[01:49:30]  than fire him they let him resign no they fired him you stupid fuck you know how that works you snl  character in the media did come out and say look our standards have got to be higher than this  those with that platform with a microphone a camera in their face they have to have some more  responsibility taken governor think about this if governor palin from six years ago was attacked 
[01:50:00]  like this would you have reacted differently how have you changed being that this was not new  i would open my mouth right up and taking a duty to have to admit that i am used to it um  of course everybody's got the right to say whatever the fuck they want yeah but let's have  an honest conversation about this i i personally don't like martin bashear i don't like his tv  show i've seen it many times but it's the same shit that we try to you know you gotta you  gotta protect these guys and and he was fired by msnbc that's how they do it nowadays so they don't 
[01:50:30]  look like the assholes right so they sit you down in an office and they go look we're gonna fire  you but you could resign and and save a little face here again there's context and where you're  saying it he he absolutely should have been fired i'm on i'm from that school of thought  why because he said something shitty no i love what he said who gives a shit what he said but as far  as a news organization but we know they're not news organizations anymore look where we work 
[01:51:00]  we can say a lot of shit if we said the same stuff in another environment we'd be fired but  we don't know if we could there's going to be a day where we're going to say something that we assume  that we could be saying and we're going to get fired if if we're at a point where we're supposed to be  held to journalistic standards uh then we should be fired he shares he should have understood the  environment i get you bright but that's but i don't think we should be here saying that he should  have been fired ever but wait is that because they're going after every fucking guy now is it  journalistic standards with that because i yes but no no what he's saying could you imagine cronkite 
[01:51:30]  talking about that well i was arrested on twitter last night you did i and what cronkite was never  fired for what did he say uh well you might want to address my twitter i did say i did say no but we're  way past the cronkite days we all know that but yeah but when these guys are doing this they're all so  biased on fox and msnbc all of them are they considered journalists like uh uh an abc news anchor  when they're all pretty much editorializing i know they're editorializing but they're editorializing 
[01:52:00]  under the flag of nbc news and they get first of all they get away with shit that's amazing that that  nbc doesn't crack down and go are we supposed to have any journalist and integrity left with our news  organization when this shit's going on but then when it reaches a point where he's talking about  that under the the the realm of nbc news the umbrella of fucking tom brokaw and every you gotta  fire but they don't have integrity as soon as they hired as soon as they hired alex baldwin to do a 
[01:52:30]  fucking news show they don't have integrity i know they should fake integrity exactly it's all phony  but are they more like news magazine shows now like the prime time shows aren't really like  i don't look at any of those uh channels as news programs it's not a news show but it's technically  under the fox news banner i'm just saying that it's the the the news integrity if you go to nbc news  which runs msnbc they run they're still under this fucking flag of nbc news if you go to the head of 
[01:53:00]  nbc news and say so do you guys think you have journalistic integrity he will fucking say  yes of course we do and cite all kinds of awards and everything else so they have to fire this guy  even though it's fake it doesn't mean the next guy's gonna say something twice as bad or something  but they have to fire these people because they have to uphold their standards somebody says something 
[01:53:30]  on red eye that's technically fox news and you got fox news course i've been on red eye plenty of times  and i've had greg say we can't say that we can't go there i've had my nose but one of these times  you're gonna get burned and it's not gonna be up to the greg and it's gonna be fox and well that's  true yeah and it shouldn't be happening i'm sorry stuff well how sometimes how come this was my point  uh i was on twitter kind of just bullshitting yesterday but how come walter croncott was never  fired when he said that uh he wanted to fill betty ford's cunt with yams 
[01:54:00]  why wasn't he fired for that it's a very good question we really gotta look into that  can i hear the audio of that it's hypocrisy is when betty ford's cunt should be filled with yams  and the warrior's lost to make concentrate on that stupid war war is lost  and ms msnbc is basically telling their viewers you're not going to see anything you know special here  you're not going to see real opinions or people getting edgy or speaking the mind their minds here 
[01:54:30]  well their idea they're basically telling everyone don't worry we're going to play it extremely safe  on our network well their idea of edgy i think is a little different than one of their guys saying  you know that that sarah palin should be the shit on and pissed on well he should have been fired  because he just did a shitty show i did try it's it's monotone and extremely just boring to watch  but the slavery option the slavery it was a dumb analogy but it wasn't made to be racist it was 
[01:55:00]  made because she's a dope right what was the actual uh quote by martin bashir the one that got him in  trouble yeah let me he said i'm paraphrasing he said that she should have her mouth shit in he said  and to prevent her from moving you put one foot on her forehead and the other are cunt oh wow  wow he said all that all right maybe i see it anthony's way oh my god martin why are you saying  these things i'm better get my yams and biting for his cut in april 1750 and assumed the position  so he's talking about slavery in reference to sarah palin referencing slavery right and he's trying to 
[01:55:30]  educate her on what's how bad slavery really right position of overseer at a major plantation  what is most shocking about sisterwood's diary is not simply the fact that he assumes the right to  own and possess other human beings but is the sheer cruelty and brutality of his regime  in 1756 he records that a slave named darby catched eating canes had him well flogged and pickled then 
[01:56:00]  made hector another slave s-h-i-t in his mouth oh first of all the fact that a grown man spells out  shit on television so he's hoping the people that would be offended by that word can't spell can't  spell any fucking four-year-old that's watching the news that's watching msnbc well shit what's  fucking children it's not an fcc by scc violation what fuck it a country of children right go ahead 
[01:56:30]  known as darby's dose a punishment invented by this that spoke only if you with darby's dose  so this was actually something they did on a regular basis to slaves no it's one instance that was written  in a diary who knows how widespread it was flogged punch well and then washed and rubbed salt pickle  lime juice and bird pepper made negro joe piss in his eyes and mouth i could go on i could go on 
[01:57:00]  when mrs palin invokes slavery she doesn't just prove her rank ignorance she confirms that if anyone  truly qualified for a dose of discipline from thomas thistlewood then she would be the outstanding  candidate well i don't have a problem see he had everybody he could have just said with brutality  like that why do you make such a glib reference right right but he had to say she would be a  candidate whatever i don't have a problem with it so apparently also you can't um use slavery as an 
[01:57:30]  analogy for anything because they were shitting in people's mouths well that's what's annoying is that  he knows that it was a dumb example she used but he's a shitty tv host but you know i don't have a  problem with what he yeah i don't think he should be fired for that he knows he knows she didn't mean it  literally like it's like he should be fired if people stop watching because they're so deeply  offended by what he said that's how it should be then nobody's watching of course in the end that's  how it should be but now i know as someone that flips around that i'm not going to see anything uh 
[01:58:00]  too interesting on it on msnbc they're going to play it extremely safe i mean having these discussions  you talk about integrity like the whole reason that he got hired was because he made the exploitative  michael jackson documentary that's why he's saying that's why there is no integrity in news  they're they're all lying to each other they got him and reverend al an ounce they have reverend al  martin bachear and alec baldwin explain explain the news integrity again to me please that's  because i don't get it that's all fake they're all in uh they were in uh solid you know uh positions 
[01:58:30]  over there too it's all it's all fake integrity but in in their fucking little world that's what they  have to uphold but then why would they go and hire those good people to begin with well because they  have their own fucking rationalization as to why they have people like reverend al reverend al isn't  the race baiting fuckwad fat bastard he was years ago he's the community leader that he he fucking sits 
[01:59:00]  with the president the president listens to what reverend al has to say these days kind of think that's  crazy okay of course it is that's a little but that's why they have him on there i mean cnn hired  pierce morgan honestly because he was on celebrity apprentice and america's got right yeah you know  what i mean yeah there's no integrity across the board oh but it was a better interview pierce turned  out to be a decent interviewer like i i like the fact that he's a very good interviewer yeah he does  a good job he might rub you the wrong way but he's asking a lot of uh tough questions he's got balls 
[01:59:30]  more balls than most of those people yes definitely i don't know i just don't like seeing any of these  guys get fucking fired it's ridiculous martin no i don't like seeing anybody get fired but i  see why they fired him yeah like if ian halperin were successful at his things he would be martin  beshear he could get a job and you know it should be great i got a fair question and like you're a fox  guy obviously if if this happens he guy if this happened on fox would you would you um think the 
[02:00:00]  same way if one of your guys over there said that it would all all depend on what obviously  they're not going to say anything like that to like something similar because obviously they're  not going to attack sarah palin that way ever over at fox well here's what happens when somebody  on the right gets uh jammed up for something they say they're fired fucking immediately it doesn't  have to go through the two weeks of uh rigmarole like it did with this guy because they're  sensitive over there so yeah that went down fired for things like just plain discussing race right 
[02:00:30]  uh and maybe saying something that's uh factual but offensive to certain people none of them should  get fired well i don't think no matter what side you believe you're on i don't think that i don't  think you should get fired for having a discussion about uh race or or or anything really he got fired  the nbc says he resigned but we all know what happened and the reasoning was he said something 
[02:01:00]  that insinuated that she should have her mouth shitting and her eyes pissed in yeah uh and that  is well over the line for a news organization he was picking extreme examples of slavery though  because she brought the slavery but he he picked extreme examples and then said that she should have to  also go through that that as far as a news organization goes is crossing their line  yeah up again whether it's fake or not their journalistic integrity the difference between 
[02:01:30]  him and and alec baldwin is that what he said was as an anchor and he said it as a news  per whatever you want to call on camera on their network he did something at work alec baldwin  did something in his personal time in a reaction to a personal invasion well that bled over years  ago your personal shit now matters yeah there was a time that didn't matter at all they didn't give  a fuck what you did as long as it wasn't illegal activity that's probably just an excuse for baldwin  now i think you're right i think so i think so too i mean they don't look good firing two guys within a 
[02:02:00]  week a week and a half and they're trying to change the image because they know that they're kind of  and they knew they were fired alec baldwin so they they told this is exactly how it went down they  told martin bashear you're going to take a couple weeks vacation it's thanksgiving anyway go away  don't worry about this shit yeah we'll take care of it because we've been through that and then he  comes back steak dinner at the friars club and then they sit down and then they go hey uh you know  this is this is going down but yeah you could you could be the one that says you're resigning or we  will be firing you so it's up to you they always give you that fucking option in a lot of cases if they 
[02:02:30]  actually like you and that's what happened i'll tell you as far as uh like red eye goes when i've  handed in my notes before the show on what we're talking about i've been told by the producer like  oh you can't say that like don't refer to them to the prostitutes you know store about prostitutes uh  as whores um oh if you're going to be talking about this story about canada i saw you you said  something you know that was derogatory about canadians and so we we want to steer clear of that like 
[02:03:00]  they're referring to 1840 is the good old days stop referring to hillary's misunderstood in air  quotes there's there's plenty instances where yes even a show like red eye has to adhere to fox news  um what they don't you think there are a lot of standards don't you think there are a lot of  moments that if you pulled them out of context and said look what's on fox news and not mention  that it's on late at night and not mention that it's probably a funny show that you could twist it 
[02:03:30]  you sure but he wasn't mr difference no and i don't want to see the guy fire but i get why they  because he was not taken out of context he was quoted perfectly in the context of what he was  saying yeah and in fairness if somebody on fox came out and gave the example about michelle obama  and in any way in any way or hillary yeah yeah and hinted that they should have their mouths  shit in gone right they would be fired gone from the business true but i uh you know his backstory leading  up to that he did a lot of research and he came up with a bunch of examples so i think he really 
[02:04:00]  felt like he had his ass you know covered on that one boy he did so much work to try he was probably  exhausting it took a long time to get to what he really wanted to say he was like look i really  want to go on the air and say that sarah palin's mouth should be shitted how can i get this out he's  probably working on it for months exactly look and people calling in saying uh he sat down and wrote  this out in advance we know that yeah but i don't care if it's in if you're writing it in advance or at  the top of your head which also means that it went through approval process yeah maybe and i think 
[02:04:30]  it sucks you guys get notes back at at fox too that's a nightmare as well you know why because  it's you know it's the new it's the culture we live it's the it's the it's it's under the guise of  news you know and they are are held to a different standard again phony or not that's what the world we  live in as far as the news goes uh you know snl could get away with doing shit that the news can't  we get away with doing that rush limbaugh can't get away they get away with saying stuff that we 
[02:05:00]  couldn't say on regular radio right it's it's there's for now there is until they change the  rules here and we don't know when that comes we'll know when when we get in major trouble and probably  fired that the rules have changed because that's how that works there's not a universal acceptance of  what can be said and not said it's it's very contextual when when you you put it under the flag of  news you know there's going to be an issue i personally i want to make this clear i personally  don't think he should have been fired yes and my eyes pissed off i don't think he should have been 
[02:05:30]  fired well not don't think he should have been fired i don't like seeing him fired i don't like  seeing any broadcaster fired for anything uh but i'm saying i understand why msnbc fired him i  understand their logic i think right i don't like their logic whatsoever they need to say we're a  news organization first and foremost well and we can't have some guy implying that she should  have their own content yeah they're fucking up their own content why would after a while people  aren't gonna i mean they're not even tuning into msnbc to begin with and this certainly isn't going to 
[02:06:00]  make more people tune in well if they really want to go all out and do a tmz type show then let them  do that i think they still want this nc held to this standard of of uh news integrity came from higher  up this price i'm sure it came from nbc news msnbc probably didn't fire right you know bingo some  heads are going to roll way upstairs when they start realizing that they're not bringing in the  viewership so you know they got to figure it out in the end this rumor cnn is going to drastically 
[02:06:30]  change their entire network oh do i love it i hope they're going to nancy grace is drummed out i was  reading that headline news they're probably going to blow up and then uh supposedly parts of cnn they're  going to reinvent as well and make it a little more entertaining a little younger with that  political angle yeah this guy on twitter says uh and sax god i disagree with him a lot but he's a  good listener he says please ask ant for an example of fox firing someone for what they said no one has  been fired but honestly uh i don't think anyone has said anything that inflammatory and i don't think 
[02:07:00]  that anyone on msnbc has been fired for just an extreme political opinion i gotta be honest the left  jumps on anyone on fox that even has a political opinion they they cry racism at the drop of a hat  if you criticize obama uh you're a racist you you you hate him not because of his policies but because  he's black all that you're not supposed to fire people for that those are opinions if you get  somebody that says something horrific and disgusting about uh like jimmy said michelle obama or hillary 
[02:07:30]  clinton then there's going to be an issue and they will shove people out the fucking door msnbc has  always been uh a hotbed for fucking degenerates it seems like with some of these motherfuckers with  what they say who from fox has been fired i can't even think of anybody as i sit here i don't know  i'm trying to think but who from any of them who from cnn's been fired but what if they oh cnn has fired  a bunch for that though oh yeah i mean for like language stuff what if somebody said that i for 
[02:08:00]  there's what should be fired for there's one guy i used to watch in the and when i was at the gym and  he got fired oh fuck what was his name the old guy who's always naked i think he was a little ethnic  like slightly juan williams juan williams was npr yeah juan williams was npr no there was a guy right  yeah that old guy okay uh there's a guy on cnn wait it was one way it was npr one williams was  on and he said it on tv yes yeah he said about he told the truth about racial profile like yeah he 
[02:08:30]  looks at people right a little differently he's on fox though i see him on he got hired yeah after  they fired him yeah yeah that cunt from npr fired him uh-huh well this this is gonna be a place for uh  you know guys to speak their mind that's what you know they're gonna push viewers toward something new  eventually and it's biting all of them like all of them this is the funny part about they're all  scared shitless as they sit there with a camera what they're live with a camera in their face  they're scared shitless to say anything but the liberals and the kids are both of them like they 
[02:09:00]  both stand on the sidelines and cheer the firing of someone else right knowing that they're all in  the same pit and right they're being attacked by dogs and they're all just fucking pointing at the  next guy with blood on them instead of turning around and standing together it's the only time you should  stand together because your livelihood is at risk as well uh-huh of course  yeah i mean look at all the guys in trouble at espn and all these sports stations guy networks 
[02:09:30]  guy networks are like beating the shit out of guys left and right and firing people  over just nonsense stuff too it's not even that crazy no  what are they doing they're they're gonna up their content eventually and nobody even cares about it  anymore like the news cycle's over nobody even really remembered that martin beshear i forgot  about it said that yeah no i know that's another thing it just they were hoping it would die down  and then they could go look all right if you resign that it makes it a lot easier it's a much less less 
[02:10:00]  of a story that's probably why i came from nbc it was probably just moving up the ladder up the ladder  nbc news was just they've had enough problems with fucking with teen alec baldwin between  their olbermann uh uh shit with msnbc just this is the nightmare of that the fucking guy or the tape  he altered for the oh yeah they've had so many issues at nbc news that whoever's on top is probably  like enough of this fucking shit clean house oh and uh jeff zucker secret show what's that 
[02:10:30]  victoria's secret show oh how naughty that must be these  were we invited we weren't invited i don't think so thank you rick sanchez thank you yeah he was fired from  cnn all right what did he say he performed his namesake on someone thank you uh brian johnson 32  on twitter uh rick sanchez yeah it's coming in a lot you're right i don't even remember what he did  on air thing but there was another guy besides rick sanchez by the way there's another guy  here's a guy i wish i could there was another guy besides rick sanchez why was he fired from cnn 
[02:11:00]  again again rick sanchez was fired i think for making a cotton picker remark oh yeah yeah what was  the actual line yeah i'm trying to see if we have um they just fucks they just fuck a person's career  just like that thank god i have a few money kids i think i have a clip of it you do go ahead eric  going to change there's a certain american public that's going to believe  go ahead i'm just i'm just sitting here just shaking my head he is the cotton pick and president of the 
[02:11:30]  united states if if the president of the united states doesn't have enough that to me was not at  all meant to be i don't know he might have he might have thought it was clever and funny to say it that  way right how many years ago was that i don't know man that was uh last year that is a term you  use when you just say ah get that cotton picking chair out of this room hey you get that my car  ain't working it doesn't but then because you're saying it about a black guy like like if you said 
[02:12:00]  that about george w bush yeah and said ah you know george w bush he's the cotton picking president what  do we think you wouldn't think literal you think it's a term now with obama oh look out because he's  black that uh all of a sudden you know the sensitivity thing did i ever tell you when i was young and me  and dean my buddy dean miller who i love so much i love dean i love and i never met the guy no he's dead  i know i just love the stories he would make me laugh so hard because he was what he was psychotic 
[02:12:30]  and we would go out and we were like 15 and we had shoveled snow so we went to new brunswick to  some pizzeria and like george street really ghetto oh and it's all black people can go  house no this is right before that phase i was still young eager i love dean jimmy and dean is  pointing at me because i was putting salt on and dean just kept going get your cotton picking hands off  the salt put down that cotton picking salt oh no and it was literally that loud and he was just i'm 
[02:13:00]  like what do you think that no one knows oh no he was a crazy motherfucker man he was crazy with  with some people looking like i don't remember it's not a great story it's the only cotton picking  story i have my whole life at least i have one you do have one what are the odds of having a  cotton picking story that ties in with this slim uh lou dobbs was pushed out of cnn as well thank  you for that someone else from fox they said because it was heath ledger commentary brian gibson i don't  know what that was was fired from fox for his heath ledger commentary brian brian gibson and then 
[02:13:30]  there is another guy i'm thinking of and i believe it was cnn and i can't think of his name glenn beck  was fired but that was some weird thing why was he fights right it wasn't something he said or  anything fox wasn't he yeah there was some some contractual i heard that he uh cried through a  live read and they knew that he was nuts and they had to get rid of him oh boy oh gee that's what i  heard oh my goodness with the chalkboard and stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah i think it was for chalk or 
[02:14:00]  something oh no yeah they'll try to eat the chalk i think oh no you got the brian gibson  no it's just brian gibson i believe so oh from fox no from timbuktu rick sanchez didn't all right  job for cnn too and they just fucking destroy his career over one dumb thing and they don't even think  about all the other body of work the guy had where he where he was well within the lines he said 
[02:14:30]  something douchey about me one time or some tweet i had sent out i don't remember what it was but one  thing and your whole career is destroyed that doesn't seem right it really doesn't john gibson  when i say brian yeah yeah john  what do you say about the heath man he played a great joker oh my god it was just amazing oh  fucking amazing i do a good version of that joker by the way not that you want to hear if i do joker

[02:15:30]  he called keith letter he he called heath ledger a weirdo with a serious drug problem um and he when  he made fun of i wish i knew how to quit you line oh broke back and said well he found out how to  quit you uh boy just trying to be funny see what's going on there's just someone just trying to be  funny and whoops sorry if you're trying to be funny he was the guy who was worried he was going to get  fired when patrice was on his show all right yeah yeah all right well uh oh you know what going into 
[02:16:00]  break we should um even though it's a visual but it does work as a radio bit as well uh chip  baca the coke logic animation is amazing go to coke logic's twitter coke logic on twitter and i'm  sure there'll be a link for it so you could find it for yourself but the animation is terrific there's  so many cool little things to look for in the background yeah they got jimmy in the background  doing the yeah that dance on the wall that's ted sheckler yeah ted sheckler wow what else is on the wall 
[02:16:30]  he's going yeah there's a photo in the bottom right of opie and vos golfing together i didn't  catch any of this stuff and you got tippy tom on the wall tom larry king now you can tell it's  top of his head right that's the uh demented world gold record what's above my head in the left  corner what is that that's uh me with mick foley and a giant picture of vince mcmahon behind yes i'm 
[02:17:00]  a little far away from the monitor a bunch of wow stickers and that don't oh we're talking  and the chickens from that animation but the uh the animation from coke logic great  i don't like that he's aging our animation characters by the way don't yourself the  flintstones with us look the same for 25 years we have a little south park kids yeah let us stay  young as in animations at least i i see what he's doing there's some program where you have 
[02:17:30]  fucking start adding a wrinkle or two and some smeary on the faces to make him look older  how come this job of the hunt not job at a condo or something we're gonna play the bit  you don't have to do the bit if we're gonna play the bit but that's good to lead into it  it's not like you need that with some humor hock up some phlegm or something family guy  uh fucking the simpsons they've they haven't aged on the simpsons and they've been on for what  48 years yeah i believe it's 52 26 26 years they didn't age at all but this coke logic feels like 
[02:18:00]  he has to age our animation characters he's right though yeah i mean you do you know mine is not asian  this one yeah i saw that because i'm wearing a max but check out the animation coke logic on twitter  but it also works for the radio we'll go to break with this uh we got a little bit do we do everything  for today oh yeah oh no what is that chip baka yeah 
[02:18:30]  millennium falcon what they call like the millennium eagle  and i don't really like chip baka  how come he doesn't have friends or something  what the  what the  yoda is  green with nb  whatever that's horrible 
[02:19:00]  jedi  i don't really like chip baka  no i don't either  yeah  green all of her how come he doesn't be happy with what he's got  i don't have a problem  i don't have a problem  i don't have a problem  i don't have a problem  uh...  uh...  come on 
[02:19:30]  want to remind people the opian anthony podcast  this week it's the best of tippy tom our homeless friend that unfortunately also  has fucking died met his demise a lot of guys that have done this radio show have died  i made a i was thinking about the other night 
[02:20:00]  the jeffrey dahmer  fucking detective that we had on recently i thought we had jeffrey dahmer on at some  what who else patrice  greg giraldo  race car driver  mike de stefano a race car driver  uh... duncan michael clark or clark michael whatever however  fucking combination that michael clark duncan  steve c  steve c  oh  it's just tippy tom of course  oh  holy  fuck  wow  what about uh 
[02:20:30]  i'm sure we're missing a few  we never had fast and furious guy right  no  no  it'd be nice if we could add sandy kane to that list  oh  wouldn't it  whoa uh  have fun with that lawsuit because she's a real pain in the ass  oh sorry roberts  you see what they're doing with the fast and furious list of guests on the show that's all  yeah  you've seen that  died  the commercials  oh yeah  they're trying to sell the dvd  and you know that they're just like oh  fuck we need this like we need a fucking hole in the head  right  we still got to sell the dvd  so now the commercial  instead you know that commercial was going to be like 
[02:21:00]  fast and furious  digs  yeah  fast grabbing  crazy motherfuckers  now it's like this somber music  fast and furious six  portions of the proceeds will go to  of course  so they got to sell this movie  because  with like this  because they're  the two have to now be connected  i know  why can't you just sell the movie because it was a cool movie  that he did obviously  before he died  it's an action like car movie  that they're selling the dvd now 
[02:21:30]  with this somber music  and and just like pictures of the cast  no cars  no nothing  can i see it  i haven't seen this commercial yet  see if you can find that  and they also stopped production on uh  number seven  did they  fast and furious seven  but you know damn well eventually  they'll go back to it  you know they'll hose some shit down  let a little time go by  and then they'll figure out an angle  why they have to make fast and furious seven  are you kidding me  there's way too much money involved  well the same they did with heath ledger's last movie  when he died  they they wound up wrapping around 
[02:22:00]  and we had um  oh the monty python  yeah  and they're getting  gilliam  terry gilliam  yeah he was an interesting guest  yeah  and uh  and they had to kind of figure out a way to work that  without heath ledger  so they'll you know they're saying it's the right thing to do of course  but eventually they will  finish uh finish fast and furious seven  and we're also learning that  he was alive  right after the crash  just burning alive  he might have been knocked out  he might have been knocked out  hopefully  hopefully he was knocked out  yeah  ow  you hope so 
[02:22:30]  but they had to tell us all that yesterday  well let me ask you  how much of the new ones they have made  that counts too  well  if they only have a minute made  they're gonna do the whole fucking thing  orange juice  it's a huge franchise  and now it's gonna be even huger  because the guy passed on  yeah  i never saw any of these movies  i  no  i hate  i have not seen one  no i didn't  i swear to you  i saw like the first two  were they good  tokyo drift  i was kind of like  that's where they lost the audience  they lost everybody  i watched the one  fast five  yeah  because the rock was in it 
[02:23:00]  oh of course  and i got  i was expecting just a shit show  yeah  it's really fucking good  so wait  what's tokyo  is that the third one  yeah they did it without any of the original cast  and  and they  and they made it like  you know  a lot of japanese people  sliding their cars around corners  man  i thought they were gonna reinvent the franchise  okay  kind of like they tried with halloween  when they did halloween 3  yes  and the director had not seen the first two  ma  let me tell you about a great movie  you like race cars  the woodman  uh yeah 
[02:23:30]  that fucking  woodman  that fucking turbo  is a terrific movie  oh look  and very believable  a snail winning the indianapolis 500  against real race cars  oh  it just goes to show you  it's just fucking amazing  slow and steady wins the race  what happened  did he put his mind to it  boy did he  oh  he got it done  you can do anything  if you put your mind to it  yeah  actually not  yeah  i'd hear the crunch of a little snail shell  i know  wouldn't he just be crushed  you would think  or wouldn't he burn  like that pavement gets really hot  wouldn't he just sit there  you would think  bubble  he avoided all the fucking tires 
[02:24:00]  all the pitfalls  he avoided pretty much everything  but then his little engine  you know  crapped out at the end  and then he had to be a snail again  to win the race  but there was a huge fucking pile up  so all the cars  were out of commission  oh and he came  so now  he is now using  what God gave him  just his lousy  horrible snail  fucking speed  spoiler alert  so nobody owns the copyright  on the tortoise and the hare story  no i guess not  no not really  pretty much it  that sounds like a ramp to me  what a bunch of horse shit  that story is  to a fucking tortoise  would have ran circles around 
[02:24:30]  that little cunt  i just learned that  from the hare  and the hare  would have  oh  hey it's opposite day  just say it's opposite day  on the O.P. Anthony show  oh  i just learned that  from Bugs Bunny  it's a fast tortoise  is that wrong  oh  i'm a camera  it was  it was movie night  with my young son  and we watched turbo  and really quickly  i had um  popcorn for the first time  in a really long time  like the fucking  shitty  butter  salted  oh wow  you know 
[02:25:00]  the orville  i went to bed  with like  fucking puffy  model lips  my  my fingertips  were dried out  from  the salt  just decided  to take the moisture  right out of your fingertips  i felt like shit  yeah  oh my god  i cause i don't  i just don't eat that stuff  when you're not used to it  that salt is an amazing chemical  but my lips  are just like  they were all dried out  and like  all swollen  nice and puffy  yeah  thank you  it's duck lips  and then the butter 
[02:25:30]  was everywhere  i felt butter  on my entire body  and they'd get like  caked on the roof  of your mouth  everywhere  and i couldn't  wash it off  my my my  my face  my fingers  you just start  to feel greasy  oh it's unbelievable  i like to think  it was awesome  it was delicious  but  the butter  at the movies  theater  you just let  the popcorn  butter go in  your hand  oh really  i don't  i don't eat butter  and uh  salt for the most part  so that was a doozy  last night  that's why you gotta  keep eating that stuff  it's like immunity  to it  and then eventually  you just die from it 
[02:26:00]  can't you eat  i can't believe it's not butter  that's better right  to get some like  really fresh popcorn  but orville doesn't believe  in that shit  no  they pound on the butter  oh my god  it's like anything else  real butter  with real salt on there  it just tastes  fucking better  it was amazing  i'm not gonna lie to you  but i felt  dehydrated  from all the salt  i got that popcorn  machine downstairs  and fire that fucker up  oh my god  it's great  i really want some popcorn  it's so god damn good  people are saying  the biggest problem  with fast and furious 7  is it's about a bad guy 
[02:26:30]  killing the good guys  so they're probably  gonna have to rework  the script  or just have them  die in it  that way they don't  have to worry about  filming any other scenes  they didn't film a death scene  so what are they gonna do  they go do you hear  what happened  no  just explode  they'll get an actor  and you only see  the back of them  like brandon lee  right  like bell lugosi  you do it like  they did in like  toxic avenger  where you just get  like a watermelon  and you paint  it flesh colored  and have a tire  run over it  did they do that  yeah  did it look good  it looked awesome  but i mean not realistic  it looked awesome 
[02:27:00]  all the old trauma movies  are like that  yeah  oh one more thing  about fast and furious  this is the ridiculous  world we live in  wheel of fortune  used a fast and furious  thing as a puzzle  you know  so you had to guess  that it was fast and furious  and i guess that's  an issue for whatever reason  yeah  and so they had to scroll  an apology  across the screen  well it was an episode  that was already filmed  obviously right  yeah it had been filmed  like two months ago  why are the two connected  why would you have  i think people could 
[02:27:30]  handle some dope  uh you know  solving the puzzle  by saying  is it fast and furious  yeah but it was just  an inappropriate question  what movie won't there  be a part seven  it was inappropriate  well why is that a problem  it was filmed before  the tragedy  and  oh it was because  the question was  how does ian watkins  like to fuck  now that's  okay now i understand  yeah it was just  too much  it was so quick  to apologize  make sure no one's 
[02:28:00]  feelings are heard  and it's just like  this is as innocent  as it comes  it's just weird timing  but there's nothing  bad there  everyone's got to  apologize for everything  so you're sorry  you're going to see  the uh  dvd commercial  yeah this is what  they went with  fast and furious  six on gloom  a portion of proceeds  will be donated to  paul walker's reach out  worldwide charity  organization which  funds first responder  efforts at crisis  points around  only showing nice  moments of hugs  in a fucking movie 
[02:28:30]  available december  10th  i don't want to  laugh at the guys  no you gotta laugh  because if they  really gave a shit  they just would not  be selling it  but they don't want  to give away  you know  they don't want to  lose all that money  could you do me a  favor and look for  fast and furious  fives dvd commercial  to see what they  would have done  right  it's the same  commercial which is  really they knew  this was going to  happen  oh wow  they knew  they know  because you know  it's an action  fucking movie  they they must have 
[02:29:00]  been beside themselves  in that meeting  what do we do  we got to sell  this dvd it's just  coming out now  oh well  oh we could  contribute  some type of  oh is that  is that it  yeah  all right  here we go  all right  million dollar  quarter mile  all right  what do you say  don  yes  yeah  yeah  see  one last job  one last job  this is the most  fucking spinning  cars  this is like  hundred million  dollars  you say what 
[02:29:30]  yeah look at  cars on fire  cars on fire  the rock  the rock was in  that one  shanks  shanks  explosions  cars flipping  over  fast and furious  five  look forward on  blu-ray and dvd  more tits than you  can count  all right and now  we have what  yeah go back to  now now now we  a mere year later  or a couple years  later  because what  happened that was  right  you see that bad  guy die in that  car wreck  oh the cars were  flipping crashing 
[02:30:00]  it was on fire  everyone's just  trying to figure out  how they can sleep  hold on sleep  better at night  yes  because they're  like oh god  we look like  assholes if we  still sell the  dvd but if we  we show the  somber side of  us then we  could still make  all that money  and i could sleep  better at night  well no not all  a portion  of the pro  scenes  one shitty  little portion  it's like wow  i saw that  fast and furious  five that was  pretty good  you see the  fucking thing  the movie's  great oh  six is out  let's see what  this is all  about it looks  really cool  when you buy 
[02:30:30]  fast and furious  six on the  rare dvd  yeah  a portion of  proceeds will  be donated  to paul walker's  reach out worldwide  oh my god  not one  not one shot  of a car  where's the  fast  they didn't even  show one car  but what  this is like a  chick flick  yeah  is that a rom-com  let's be honest  they are in a  really rough  position  oh they are  he died in a  car crash  and they're like  okay  we have to pay  the other actors  they all have  deals  we should  they should  sell it 
[02:31:00]  yeah  how do we  sell  if he died  in a boating  accident  they'd probably  show the  paul walker's  but he died  in a car crash  yeah  the stores  already have  the dvds  before  like you know  what i mean  this is like  rocky six  coming out  and sylvester  salone was  punched  to death  how do you  show that  it really is  you're right  yeah  or the woodsman  two is coming  out  and kevin  baker just  died tickling  someone  i know  i know  but i mean 
[02:31:30]  i mean  it's a little  ridiculous  to go to  the opposite  extreme  yeah  that's just  a rough  what do you  do  i guess  it's like  florentine's  bit about  the nfl  trying to  sell pink  jerseys  and giving  like a tiny  two percent  to  i don't even  know if it's  two percent  yeah  it's a horrible  charity  it's a good  cause but a  horrible charity  meaning not  a lot of  that money  gets to the  actual cause  right  oh yeah  that's just  a bunch of  charities like  that  done something  so they could 
[02:32:00]  do that  somber thing  so what  why is everyone  talking about  michelle obama  knocking that  girl down  it's just  some dumb  accident  right  what is she  fucking  knockout game  is she playing  knockout game  she's playing  the knockout  game  i guess their  stupid dog  knocked over  a girl by  accident  yeah it was  funny  fuck  the clips  everywhere though  crazy  it is  i haven't seen  this  you haven't seen  this yet  no  i'm looking  there's a good  animated  give i'll just  show you  i guess  dog should  be put  down  sounds  vicious  yeah you  know what  if that  was a  bear  they'd

[02:33:30]  like a novelty  song or something  it's worse than  friday  dude it is so  bad  but it's in that  same vein of  goofy dumb stupid  songs that do  very well on the  internet  if that black  guy saw that  song he'd be  like i should  have produced it  but his voice  is so bad  he can't sing  he's obviously  he's in this  video with the  talking about how  hot this girl is  he is so gay  in the video  so gay  i honestly don't  remember the video  we're gonna play it  but first michelle

[02:40:00]  oh  what is he?  why does he tip his hat?  he tipped his hat  because he's looking  at the camera  because he knows  we just saw the video  it was all a dream  but we're in on it  or was it?  we're in on it  but it was though  because if he was dancing  he'd probably be all sweaty  and smelly  he might have been doing  all that while she was shopping  he's got his own shit going on  yeah  it's spelled  the name is J-E-W-L-I-A  yeah yeah yeah  well Jewel 
[02:40:30]  you know how different  this song would be  if it was L-I-A  it was Bagel  the name he gave her  he's dumb though man  that should go viral  it should be you  and you know  it's the generation  that's a different  that's a  the pop music you mean?  no the video itself  it's losing quality  because it's  you know  generation after generation  because he keeps pulling it  and then someone  finds it somewhere  but it's not as good  as the original copy  that's the 2013  version of the VHS dub  that's sort of 
[02:41:00]  what I was trying to say  how old is the original?  that thing's gotta be  7 years old by now  he did it pretty quick  after we  2005  do you think he was  embarrassed by it?  yeah I think he was  very embarrassed by it  especially at the  I think his real problem  was the response it got  and the fact that it did  gain a certain notoriety  on this radio program  yeah but it was ready  to get notoriety  everywhere  100%  it was ready to cross over  I'm telling you  it's just what the internet likes  if he put this out  full quality on his channel 
[02:41:30]  right  and just accept that  you know  I mean  one of the late night guys  would get it  fuck yeah  and he'd become huge  you know our  female intern was getting  all lathered up  watching it in there  who Nikki?  Nikki yeah  she likes stuff like that  she's getting all excited  she likes pop music  does she?  yeah  that was terrible  you're just fucking  making shit up  she was watching it  oh  can you ask Nikki  what she thought?  Nikki what did you think?  come here  what do you think of  Julia?  I think he might be  a little gay  what?  did it come off like that 
[02:42:00]  in the video?  yes  what about all the girls  that were with him?  yeah man  that doesn't mean anything  no?  no  he was shopping with him  no  right shopping with him  oh  he was touching him  and stuff  yeah they were dancing  did you see the blocks?  they were dancing with each other  it was a little awkward  he looked a lot gay  that's why I think  it would be an amazing hit  yeah  and he's walking everywhere  on these late night shows  with a girl on his arm  right right  he's the new Liberace  any women in your life?  I don't know  I thought it was  well produced 
[02:42:30]  enjoyable songs  extremely well produced  would you put that  on your iPod?  yes I would  I would love to know  who did that for him  yeah  I think it was people  with some real credits  would you have him  on the show  as an artist  as a guest?  hell yeah  in a fucking second  what if he said  I will only talk  about my song  I would say  and video  we'd like you to come in  at 6  spend as much time  as you'd like  feel free to say  until 1020  Julia  break the song down 
[02:43:00]  lyrically  all I want to do  is find out  behind the scenes  of the video  wink  that's just artistic  oh  Gary Coleman  being added to the list  Richard Jenny  being added to the list  oh  damn man  and people are shocked  by the Dahmer detective  we had an amazing  time with that guy  he was awesome  and then  he died of a heart attack  oh  only a couple months  after he was on our show  yep  alright let's go to Kenya 
[02:43:30]  got a Kenya news story  man charge in court  for fucking a goat  and the goat is in court  to give a victim statement  yeah I guess  yeah  a victim  why is the goat in court  because it's Kenya  honestly the goat  they asked him  if it was how he was doing  and he said  I couldn't even do it ironically  I saw it coming  yeah I couldn't do it  can we play it from there  or you want me to play it from here 
[02:44:00]  I cut it down a little bit  on the audio  but we can play it  how long is that clip  125  oh perfect  10 out of 20 seconds  perfect  oh uh  didn't Buddy Epson die  finally  he is also the guy  from The Naked Gun  alright  Leslie Nielsen  you humiliated Leslie Nielsen  when he called in the show  no we didn't  no?  I don't think so 
[02:44:30]  a little bit  what?  yeah  alright you want to hear  the story from Kenya  no not really  you don't?  mm-mm  alright  the man put his penis  in a goat  that's Jamaican  I want to hear  I want to hear about the man  putting his penis  in a goat  that's what they sound like  in Kenya  yes it is  you are charged  before this court  with putting your penis  in a goat  how do you plead?  it's a whole different continent  yeah 
[02:45:00]  alright  while we play this  go ahead  hit play  Amalindic court  has sentenced a man  to 10 years  you're trying to tell me  I don't know  yes it does  the court  sentenced a man  because he put his penis  in a goat  is that the right slang  yes it is  listen to the woman  tell the story  is in prison  for defiling  a goat  yes 
[02:45:30]  interestingly  during the sentencing  the goat  that was defiled  was present  in the courtroom  here's the story  there's the goat  is that the goat?  yes  in the courtroom  that's also the courtroom  yeah well you see  because he was going  to give a victim  impact statement  and then they're going  to cut his throat  and eat it  of course  exactly  kill two birds  with one stone  yeah it's Caribbean  let's have lunch  let me see  caught as evidence 
[02:46:00]  to a case  but in Malindi  a she-got  the third victim  of the security  was present  watching quietly  as an alleged assailant  was sentenced  Kitsaogona  a middle-aged man  got 10 years behind  birth  to ruminate  on the sins  which admitted  committing  with the she-got  members of public  inside the courtroom  were shocked  when the accused  made the confession  but what surprised  them more  was the sentence  slapped on the accused  by the Malindi  resident magistrate  Moudon in Zee Bay  10 years  for bestiality 
[02:46:30]  was a new record  in this Malindi  courtroom  the accused  have been charged  they switched  to another language  halfway through the story  you have trouble  following that  oh my god  it's because  the she-got  was a victim  of sexual assault  and in the courtroom  they had not given  the 10 years  this is the first time  10 years  was given  for bestiality  he's floating  he's floating  more towards  Kenyan  but it's still  Caribbean  no it's not  the she-got  the she-got  it's the longest  time in the court  the magistrate 
[02:47:00]  gave a 10 year  sentence  when they were  not expecting  but they were  surprised by  the confession  I understand  very confused  black person  no I'm not  I'm a man  who doesn't like  to see goats  injured  and the goat  was present  in the courtroom  as the assailant  was sentenced  hit it  10 years  for bestiality  was a new record  in this Malindi  courtroom  the accused  had been charged  that he had  kernel knowledge  of the she-got  on Monday 
[02:47:30]  this week  at the bus  of village  in Gede  location  the prosecution  told the court  that Kitsa  was caught  in the act  by a man  who was passing  by the bush  where the incident  was taking place  that you see  that the man  had kernel knowledge  of the goat  and because the man  passed by the bush  and see the man  assaulting the goat  there's no room  for interpretation  he had to get  10 years  in the courtroom  the magistrate  saw to it  they were saying  that when the guy  passed the bush  he's fucking a goat  behind a bush  oh man 
[02:48:00]  but I guess  he had to do it  naked  because what  tipped the guy  off was the dude  who was fucking  the goat  all his clothes  were on the bush  why did he have  to be naked  why couldn't he  just pull his dick  because a lot  of times you do  that the goat  would push its  dude behind it  back against  your trousers  and then everybody  will see goat  duty all over  the front  of your trousers  is duty  heinie  that makes sense  nobody want  goat duty  on the trousers  because then  you got to  explain why  you got goat  duty on your  trousers  and you lower  part of your  shirt  it only makes  sense that this  is happening  in the Caribbean 
[02:48:30]  that's right  the man decided  to remove his  clothes and make  love to the goat  he liked the way  the goat  hairy legs  bang against  his smooth  ones  incident was  taking place  also present in  court was a report  from district  veteran officer  indicating evidence  of the act  in mitigation  the accused  pleaded for  pardon saying  he had a  disabled wife  who depended  on him  so he's going 
[02:49:00]  to get 10  years  yeah  but his  excuse was  no  have mercy  on me  even though  I fucked  that goat  I have a  disabled wife  that's going  to need me  at home  helping  yes the wife  was not able  to make love  so he had  kind of knowledge  with the she goat  he tried to have  kind of knowledge  with his wife  but he could not  because of her  disability  I love that they  called it a she goat  it's a she goat  because homosexuality  has even more  than bestiality  he would have  gotten like 40  years  oh yeah 
[02:49:30]  what country is this  Kenya  sure he can  they're that crazy  about crimes like  that in Kenya  you'd be surprised  probably running  rampant  you would think  that would be  way down the list  of things they're  worried about  yeah yeah  but  wow  alright  and then we got  the Biebs  yeah what's this  Bieber story  what the fuck  well  he's in  you know  his new thing  is graffiti  really  yeah 
[02:50:00]  he loves doing  graffiti  that's his art  that's his release  he says  cool  good for him  what's that one  what's that one  what's that one  Bieber  fuck yeah  the Biebs  needs a release  I get distracted  easily  what was that  Bob Barker thing  oh  what did he say  Bob Barker  I'm turning 90  and I could still  beat Adam Sandler's house  oh he's still  going with that  that's hilarious  price is wrong  he's gonna be 90  fuck man  I mean I'll be  turning 92  but not for a while  that's hilarious  but yeah  so now she  Justin Bieber 
[02:50:30]  right  is  he's doing graffiti  ah no  what is it  what do you mean  like he paints  pictures with spray  paint on walls  oh he thinks  he's gonna  ah he's like  Banksy  like Banksy  yeah like  exactly  except him  his name is  sperm Banksy  wow  what kind of shit  does he do  would you like  like an original  Biebsy  yes I would  like to see him  draw something  maybe out of  fondue  out of fondue  what kind of 
[02:51:00]  shit does he do  he does like  funny faces  ah  is his fan base  eating it up  the girls  they love it  do they  yeah  and where is he  doing this  like wherever  he performs  this one got him  in a little trouble  oh no  black  yeah  that looks very  african  you can construe  it as racist  yeah it's like  blackface  oh this guy  is gifted  yeah like  wherever he  performs  this one  this one was  in Rio  that's terrible  he stinks  they probably 
[02:51:30]  blocked it off  and the police  watched him do it  of course  and look what  he wrote there  can you read that  Jim  let me see  I can't  let me get  my reading  glasses  I think you're  in this club  ah  I'm wrote  Beliebers  that's right  yes I am  he wrote  Beliebers  above his graffiti  because that's  who he does it for  the Beliebers  how can you try  to be gangster  and still write  Beliebers  Beliebers  yeah make up  your mind  he's an idiot  are you fucking  Tupac or the  cute 12 year old  I thought  all right 
[02:52:00]  so what happened  so the mayor  of Australia  was like fuck  you don't do  this shit here  he threatened  to fuck his mouth  the mayor  of the mayor  of Gold Coast  Australia  where's that  it's in Australia  what part  coast  which part  it's like  left or right  let's say  up or down  left  upper left  oh  something I just  made up  yeah no  it's actually  the closest part  to the equator  that's why  it's called  the Gold Coast  because the beaches  are yellow  I don't buy that  you shouldn't  no  you would be 
[02:52:30]  great at  boulder dash  what is boulder dash  oh just one of  those shitty  family games  I hated  where you have  to lie  I claim  boulder dash  yes that's  boulder dash  I had family  members that  were really  into it  I would just  sit there  like a dummy  I just  fucking  couldn't be  bothered  well the  funny thing  I sucked  at it  the name  was so cute  but the  questions were  really weird  like let's  say oh you're  full of boulder dash  well it says  here that you  can fit 40  pounds of  gravel into  the average  cunt  I claim 
[02:53:00]  boulder dash  that's boulder  dash  boulder dash  it's a word  that no one  fucking knows  and then everyone  comes up with  what the meaning  is  what it is  wait that's  oh but it could  be a made up  word  it's not a made up  word it just  happens to be a  shit load of words  that no one  fucking knows  so who wins  boulder dash  word go ahead  how do you win  the game  and then you gotta  trick people  if people like  pick yours  is the real  definition  you get points  but everyone  knows it's kind  of like boulder  dash means  bullshit 
[02:53:30]  well they're  different  it's not just  boulder dash  there's different  words  oh  you don't play  this word  boulder dash  every time  yeah you want  people to pick  yours  because if you  pick the right  definition you get  the points  but if you pick  someone else's  definition which  isn't right  then that person  gets the points  I was good at  boulder dash  I hate  I called it  Scrabble  oh my god  Sam let's get  to a word for  boulder dash 
[02:54:00]  you got a  example of a  boulder dash  word  fine  Sam I'll get  the definition  correct  it was extremely  rare that a word  would be picked  that you actually  knew  I know most of  the words  oh my gosh  yeah what is it  can't they  fucking these poor  whales that sucks  yeah  I guess they can't  just  stuck in that  booth  drag them  it's just  the running joke  why are these  lazy whales  lounging on the  beach  lazy whales  don't want to  do anything  they don't want  to swim  yeah just  fucking taking  it easy 
[02:54:30]  soaking up the  sun  and I thought  they were  supposed to be  smart  yeah exactly  not too smart  when you need  water to survive  you decide to go  where it's two feet  deep  big fat heads  how about you  turn around  get out of there  all you have to do  is keep in the  deep water  right  yeah  use your sonar  shitheads  and here come  the real answers  now  you know  the reason  because the  man made noise  the last call  was full of shit  it's because  bunch of lazy  whales trying to  get some beach  time  that's what they 
[02:55:00]  are  you got a  boulder dash  word  I do  all right  cockatory  that one  whisper  chip does  like that  word  cockatory  and then you  sit there  and you come  over to  definition for  cockatory  and hope  people believe  that yours  is the right  definition  what is the  actual definition  of cockatory  why don't we  have to guess  yeah  a place where  cocks are stored  oh is it a place  where cocks are  stored  no I say it  means something  like crazy  crazy or  um  off the wall

[02:56:00]  too  um  a time when  you would say  no thanks to  the tory  cockatory means  what anthony  did not  say  spolder dash  spolder dash  oh  of course  cockatory means  to be accompanied  by loose bowels  ah  like uh  to be accompanied  that means what  you bring them

[03:03:30]  here's your host sam roberts  yes indeed  welcome welcome  866-WOW1-WOW if you want to call in  welcome to after opie anthony live  joining me at this time  very funny comedian named sam morale  how are you  what's up man  not much  every time i hear this song i think of the wolf of wall street trailer  yeah that looks really good  it looks awesome  i think motorola is using this 
[03:04:00]  i know  they get overuse these songs  i know  it's kanye right  yes  i don't know anything about music  except i know that uh  yeah it doesn't look that cool  it's like new slaves  and then it's a phone ad right  yeah  yeah  it's kind of accurate  well no it's black skinheads  what's it  is it  it's one of those two songs  i think it's black skinheads  it is right eric  yeah yeah  the slaves won't make more sense  for the phone  yeah  yeah  just sitting there  attached to it  i know  it's ridiculous  um 
[03:04:30]  but yeah i always get bummed out though  because i had like as soon as the album came out  and i heard that song  i was like yeah i think i can make that into something  and like we turn it into an intro  and then it pops up on commercials  then it pops up  and eventually people be like  oh yeah you used the motorola song on your show  that's pretty cool  i know  it's sad  it's like how people know songs about like the who  yeah  car commercial  or something  right  but i mean how do you expose people to new music  i don't know  it's impossible now  um  i'm glad you're here sam  i'm glad to be here  uh what's going on  i stayed out too late 
[03:05:00]  i'm a little hungover  but like you know  you know what it is when you're like at the  like i'm at the club last night  and i'm just like  i'm gonna have like one or two drinks  and then it's like you're just with your friends  you're like i'm gonna get fucking drunk  yeah  do you come to that conclusion though  do you get there  do you go no i'm gonna get  i'm gonna get fucking drunk tonight  yeah i used to lie to myself  but now i'm kind of just like  just admit it  and you'll feel better about yourself  right  like i do  i'm doing this on purpose  yeah  this wasn't an accident  yeah this is like  this is fun  just have fun  i'll wake up  i'm a big boy  right  i mean you're not gonna kill yourself 
[03:05:30]  how old are you  i'm 27  okay so  you've been drinking for how long  14 probably  all right  so is there any point  where you're like  i'm gonna cut this off at this point  are you going  no this is good  this is life  i used to say i was  you know it's like my mom  will like i'll order a scotch  in front of my mom  and she'll be like  you know your grandfather  died of esophageal cancer  so that's in your blood  yeah i'm like  i'm like  it's kind of hard to enjoy this  when you just say that  as i order it  but uh  so now in front of her  i just call it  i just say  can i get an esophageal cancer 
[03:06:00]  on the rocks  and uh  she gets depressed  but that's another thing  you're like  i know what i'm doing  i might get cancer from this  yeah  but it's okay  because i'm doing it  i'm gonna get it in like  my grandpa died at like 89  and i'm like  yeah  it's a good run  yeah  that's one of the  something's going to kill you  yeah totally  are you a pleasant drunk  i think so  i think it's like  you know what i think it is  you ever hear someone say like  you drink to celebrate  it's okay  but you drink to  do you drink  because you're trying to cover something up  that's a problem  i think i try to only drink 
[03:06:30]  i guess  but that's generally  jovial alcoholics  are the ones who use that slogan  yeah  well maybe that's who i'm hanging out with  yeah  i don't know  it's right we're happy man  it's no problem  no but like i think  like you gotta be careful  after like a breakup  or after something bad happens  you gotta be careful to get drunk  but  otherwise i think  yeah i think i'm pretty good usually  dj who kid just stopped by too  you know dj who kid  what up  i do now  what up  this is who kid  this is sam morale  he's a very funny comedian  we were just  thank you  do you drink  who kid  i know you like  you're a party guy 
[03:07:00]  you're first of all  yeah  what's with the fucking necklace  it's only 72 g's  i just thought i'd just walk around with it  you know  who kid walks in here  with like the most ridiculous  72 g's  gold necklace  this is my  this is my  what day is today  it's thursday  yeah this is my thursday piece  okay stop  that really cost 72 thousand dollars  you wanna check it out  yeah  that's  i mean you could have got like a car  or something for that  or a house  depending on where you are in the country  with that shit  is it heavy  oh it is really heavy  it's like when you see a gun  and you're like there's no 
[03:07:30]  wow this is pretty heavy  does it feel like 72 g's  i don't know what 72 g's  that's what a discount  with a discount  72 g's  that's made of pure gold  that's one point  something  a half kilo  of gold  how do you decide to spend this much  on a piece of jewelry  i'm an ignorant  nigga  oh i see  don't turn this into a racial fan  i was trying to  right  i was trying to learn  you don't want to be a nigga man  there's no part of you that like  sees  i could really spend that 72 thousand  much more wisely  i mean i have other money 
[03:08:00]  that i use wisely  this is the stupid side  how much ignorant money  could you possibly have  i want some of that ignorant money  i want that good money  can you imagine having  72 thousand dollars  of ignorant money  i can't imagine  having 10 thousand dollars  of ignorant money  i can't imagine  having 10 thousand dollars  you know  they always say  black people don't have  bank accounts  i walk around with it  on my neck  gold is like  you know  it keeps its value  yeah but you sound like  one of those adult  action figure collectors  they're like  no but it's also an investment  you know  you keep everything 
[03:08:30]  in the packages  that's what I thought  about my baseball cards  you're not really paying off  trying to make something  ignorant  but you know  sound smart  at the same time  right right right  baseball cards  weren't the wisest investment  yeah what  what happens  i know gold  always increases in value  i guess  but what are you gonna do  bring it to a cash for gold  place  like it's a rope  it's not exactly a brick  it's a rope necklace  you don't feel like a target  walking around with that  yeah motherfucker  do you put it on outside  or are you just like  because you know  you're coming to this show  where it's gonna be like  two white guys named sam 
[03:09:00]  that are gonna sit here  and just be like  whoa  where'd you get it  you got two sams up here  i know i'm not gonna get robbed here  he rocks somewhere in the back  smoking coke  this would be the perfect place  to rob you though  because you wouldn't see it coming  how great would it be  well anthony left right  he's the one with the guns  right  so he's gone  so you don't have  he's my nigger  so he don't have to fuck with that shit  you don't have that to worry about  plus nobody would believe it either  like if we walked out of here  and just went and sold the necklace  those two guys robbed me  36 grand apiece dude  it'd be worth it 
[03:09:30]  so worth it  you know i don't know  yo yesterday i did mtv  so i'm you know  it's jay-z's birthday  so i wore it  to respect jay-z's birthday  because you know  his chain's actually bigger than mine  he's also a billionaire  yeah so all right  so what's the difference though  if you're jay-z i get it  like if for jay-z  you know you could make  another million dollars  whenever you want  you just go to the barclays  and be like i'm gonna do two shows  i get it but i don't get it  because he's got beyonce  like don't you kind of do this stuff  for chicks at some point  and then you fuck  when you're married with a kid 
[03:10:00]  you really don't need  to peacock anymore  yeah he's and he's jay-z  like women are like  you know  they get it  but not only that  jay-z hangs with  the president obama  he hangs with  the mayor bloomberg  he has like  his own hat  at the yankee stadium  okay so  he blows his money  the right way  but don't you  he hangs with world leaders  and he has a hat  isn't it weird  he hangs with  obama  and like do you feel like  he gets like a free pass  from oprah  and stuff  you know  remember when oprah  was like  kind of trying to  vilify 50 cent  oh yeah 
[03:10:30]  she was like  i don't like rappers  who use the n-word  and then for some reason  jay-z always gets a free pass  why is that  i don't know  i think he's figured out  how to be cool  like he's  i mean  maybe sacrilegious  for a lot of people  but he's kind of like  the closest thing  this generation has  to frank sinatra  he is  right  especially when that  new york song came out  they're playing at  the yankee games  right  so you're like  that's kind of  and then he says  i'm the new sinatra  he's not really subtle  about it  not at all  but you're like  yeah good  okay yeah  sure you are  i buy it 
[03:11:00]  but he has  lip pathies  it's like a  it's like a sympathy  over his lips  what does that mean  black people  they sympathize  because he's got  big lips  yeah so you know  we feel sorry for him  you think people  so you think  you think oprah  i don't think  that's the case  i think he's like  sinatra in the sense  that like sinatra  was cool  to everyone  he gets the lips  and so even oprah  i don't think  sinatra was cool  to everyone  i hear he was like  a manic depressive  lunatic  yeah but didn't people  wasn't he just like 
[03:11:30]  this thing of like  oh yeah he's the guy  he's the cool dude  yeah i know  oh i thought you meant  he was nice to everybody  oh oh no no no no  like everybody thought  he was cool  yeah he's like the man  yeah yeah i think  that's how jay is  but he's the one  that used to shoot  things in his balls  right  shoot things in his balls  sinatra did  yeah didn't his gay lover  like age and that  no that's liberace  that's damn  liberace is dead right  yes  yes liberace is  long deceased  um  oh yeah  we're talking about  drinking  oh yes 
[03:12:00]  when you walked in here  okay  are you  do you drink  or are you more like  you stay in the zone  you try to get other people  to drink  because obviously  dj who could  as a dj  he's got to be  the party starter  always  yeah dj clubs  yeah i drink  i drink wine and shit  but do you get like  fucked up  or just have a couple  drinks  no i don't get fucked  i like seeing people  fucked up around me though  you know  take advantage of them  they'll take their  wallets  i think you're talking  about women for a second  they went right to money  again  but i like though  that in my mind  i was like  he better not be talking  about date raping 
[03:12:30]  oh burglary  oh that's fine  that's no problem  but usually uh  places is easy to get  when the chick is like  aroused from alcohol  that's yeah  that's creepy about it  i feel like i got  if i see a drunk chick  and she's kind of like  i'm like i gotta get  drunk and catch up  you don't want to be  that dude  you know  well this is our  first meeting  but you strike me  as a guy who likes  to have excuses  to get very drunk  oh yeah  you're like we're  celebrating  well she's drunk  i better get drunk  or it's sleazy  i do have that about me  i think  i also have that thing  where you know  when you wake up  and you're like  i'm never touching 
[03:13:00]  alcohol again  and then you're like  you're like  well i'm here  oh shit man  do you  is it weird though  because aren't a lot  of stand-ups now sober  yeah what the fuck is that  is that weird for you  i feel like i grew up  and like  every book you read  about like snl  and stuff  they're just like  they're like  oh all they did  was cocaine  and get crazy  and now everyone  they're just like  they you know  i know people  that write for that show  and they're like  yeah it's a pretty  tame environment  right  we all kind of  work together  yeah  it's like what  nobody's using drugs anymore  yeah  i thought that was like  i thought that was 
[03:13:30]  like what funny people were  like they were like  the fuck-ups  right  you know  i don't know  yeah because  and i would think too  like you  as especially a young stand-up  there's probably these guys  that you watched  coming up  and you're like  oh i can't wait to  fucking be a comedian  i get to drink with these guys  and hang out  yeah  those guys are all sober  right  they're like  no we don't  we don't do that  we don't do that  i guess i'll  i'll just drink that  there's no more  belushies out there  there's no more  well they died  i like that  yeah  now like word gets out  there's two people  are overexposed  especially with like  you get fucked up now  what do you do 
[03:14:00]  you like go on twitter  and you ruin your career  oh yeah  that's all right  you know you're fingering  a little boy  no it's a big deal  yeah i don't know  if that was a big deal  even in the wild 80s  that was a big deal  so yeah i mean  were you disappointed  when you got to that point  where you could hang out  with some of these people  and you're like  oh they don't really hang out  you're disappointed  but then like  you're even more disappointed  than the ones that kept partying  and are now dead  so if you had to get sober  good for you  you know i don't  judge that at all  you ever met 
[03:14:30]  eddie murphy  i've never met him  he never touched you  he never touched me  we were talking about  eddie murphy  oh you were  on the last  no two days ago  oh okay  when you were in here  he's very touchy that guy  is he  so you i'm guessing  you have a story about  he never touched me  i'm not a comedian  but i hear he touches  a lot of new comedians  up there  where'd you hear that from  i'd let him touch me  if he put me in one of his movies  i need to watch  he'll touch you  where'd you hear that from  well you know  you make up some weird shit  when you come in here  this is a weird rumor  i heard the tranny thing  about eddie murphy  i heard that 
[03:15:00]  yeah you've heard  the tranny thing right  i mean yeah  that's real  that's in the news  he was pulled over  and yeah  TMZ  had a tranny  do you think  he's into trannies  or was that an accident  he said he picked up  the tranny  because he felt sorry  because he was in the streets  so he wanted to make sure  the tranny got home safe  that's a real story  i would believe that  is that same thing  about the lip  some sympathy  yeah  what is that  i mean  how do you feel about that  because people are into trannies  what is that  what is that  well look  here's the weird thing  for where i'm from 
[03:15:30]  i'm you know  i'm here every morning right  so i hang out  with these people  whose world  and you're probably  the same way sam  that the people  that we hang out  with their world  view is so different  from what the actual  world view is  that everything gets skewed  so like i'm hanging out  with norton  every day  who's celebrating  the tranny  and talking about  how great it is  and blah blah blah  and so like  somewhere in my head  i'm thinking  i'm weird  for never of having  had a tranny experience  right 
[03:16:00]  you know what i mean  you're not  don't think that  thank you  if you're into that  i don't like it  you know  i don't judge  trannies either  like if you're  if that's your dick  i don't  if you want to get rid of it  you should  you're probably  gonna be a better person  without it  you know  but you like to know  up front  yeah  you know what i mean  especially like  it's not for me  if i'm watching a porn  and they zoom down  and i see a dick  it's not a pleasant  surprise for me  you know  it's one of the worst  surprises  i gotta go to thailand  next week too  you guys are scaring me  are you really going to thailand  next week  what are you going for  i'm djing at a club  out there  a lot of lady boys 
[03:16:30]  out there  yeah little dicks  it's getting like  way classier gigs  than i get  i'm like going like  indianapolis  harrisburg pennsylvania  for real  next week  where am i  i'm in malaysia  next week  dubai  and then thailand  wow that's why  you came in  in an old nicks t-shirt  and who came in  in a 72 thousand dollar  necklace  that's true  you probably should  have different gigs  i'm like this is one  of my better nicks t-shirts  i felt pretty good about it  i always wondered  why people like  trannies  that's a big question  why  yeah people have weird  there are people  who just like trannies  like yeah  and normal people too 
[03:17:00]  it's supposed to be  like gays is cool  because it's everybody  i told you everybody's  gonna be gay in 2022  but that's the year  that's the year  i've been getting a lot  of pussy before  get it while it's good  because you're not  gonna be into it for long  i've heard about it  from the incas  but anyway  but uh  i'm telling you right now  i never understood  why people like  trannies  and i don't know  do you know  have you met bailey j  do you know bailey j  i know of uh her  right she does uh  she's on bob kelly's  podcast network  and she's been in here  before and she does  all this stuff  i believe  if i'm not mistaken  i could be wrong 
[03:17:30]  because i'm wrong  all the time  but i think  that her husband  who she's married to  is not gay  oh really  and they just fell in love  and they're married now  but she's got a dick  that would take a really  strong connection  and let me look past  that  that is  eric's telling me  i'm correct  and then all  but it's it's  it's strange  because she is  an attractive  female  she looks hot  with pants  on  so that's a  that's a dude  yeah  okay 
[03:18:00]  she's  she's got a dick  but she's got  great tits  she's got a pretty face  you know  it's  well yeah  you know what  i used to think  i was  i was a  like i love tits  i used to think  i was like a tit man  but i'm definitely  like a no dick man  that's my first  prerequisite  i think  what are you like  in a girl  vagina  please  like a whole  internal genitals  uh  i was with a girl  recently in uh  with a dick  no no no  but this is like  i met her online  and and we were  just hanging out  after a show  she came to a show  and we were hanging out 
[03:18:30]  and she kept making  this joke  like she was like  well what surprised  you most about girls  online  i was like  you honestly  i've seen a few girls  that i thought were  pretty hot  and then it says  tranny down  and i was like  that's fucking scary  i'm glad  i'm glad they play  by the honor code  and then i  this girl thought  it'd be funny  to keep teasing me  so she was like  what maybe i have a dick  and i'm like  yeah that's not  like that  that's not my sense  of humor  but she kept saying  that like  maybe i have one  to the point  that i got her home  and as i'm taking  her panties off  she's like  might have a dick  i'm like 
[03:19:00]  please stop  please stop doing this  from now on  you should have a policy  if you're gonna make  jokes like that  in the restaurant  before we leave  i'm gonna need  to see that vagina  i know  i i was trying  to be subtle about it  when we were making  it out in the bar  and i was like  trying to feel  and i'm like  well she might have  like a huge clit  or just a really  small penis  i don't know  i can't tell  but it's also  it's 2013  going on 2014  you have to worry  about not being  homophobic  not saying the wrong  things so it's like  if you got along  with her  it's like she might  have a dick  and i'm the asshole 
[03:19:30]  for being politically  incorrect  right  because if you're  getting along with  her throughout  the whole date  and like you seem  into her  right  so what  she's got a dick  jump in  and you're like  i don't think so  she looks hot though  with the chick  that's on the  bailey j  yeah  i've seen pictures  i wouldn't now  i'll put it that way  you wouldn't  i wouldn't now  would he fuck her  if she was  i don't know  sal's in there  right now  hey sal  you know  what we're talking  about  would you have  would you have  sex with bailey j  uh no  no  i wouldn't either  she's cool and all 
[03:20:00]  but just  yeah and i don't mean  that to be insulting  what  does she look hot  sometimes like  if you catch her  like her face  the right way  it's not bad  would you have  sex with her  if she had a vagina  yeah  yeah me too  but if she got a dick  would you look  would you get head only  would i get head from her  yeah  that's a great question  yeah  because you know  you know it's not like  you're touching the dick  yeah  let me think  that's like half over  here's the thing though  and like  i already hate myself  after hooking up with like  anyone  you know what i mean  so my 
[03:20:30]  and for me  that's a deal breaker  i think  i couldn't do it  so if you knew  what if you didn't see the dick  but you knew she had a dick  but she took her shirt off  but left her skirt or pants on  i'm out at that point  couldn't even get head  i'm totally out at that point  i i'm not  i'm a pretty traditional guy  when it comes to like that  that's the world we live in  like  i might be weird  i'm a little traditional  i don't like dicks  it's like sexually balancing  i have to defend it  um  no  it's cool if you do it  you wouldn't sexually balance yourself 
[03:21:00]  like all right  all right  you gotta dig  but you do look hot though  would you do it  would you accept head  no way  what do you want me to do that  okay you're right  even even if you would  and you probably would  but you can't admit it  because hip-hop does not  you cannot  you can't do it  that's a hip-hop guy  absolute deal  yeah i mean  you talk about those sweet gigs  that who kid has  the minute he says  yeah i guess i would accept  that's it  that's it for all the gigs  that's all we don't understand  like you know  like will smith  and all those guys  like they  you know they like cock  so we don't  will smith does  you're telling me that  well smith is 
[03:21:30]  i've heard the rumor  but it's confirmed  that's from who kid  i mean i don't know  if it's confirmed or not  but any lawsuits  so i can look it up  so he's  so he stays married  with jada pinkett  for appearances  you're saying  yeah she's a lesbo  so they just like  so how'd they have those kids  they look like them  for business  it's like yo  you gotta look like  the perfect family  so he's always got to  stick it in for business  exactly  do you think he'll ever  come out at any point  do you think he'll ever  make enough money  he's like 80 on a wheelchair  and his dick is gone  do you think so 
[03:22:00]  what a miserable existence  you think he fucks dudes  on the side  or he's just kind of miserable  i mean it's alright  no it's not alright  that would be  that would be a horrible life  it's a sad way to live  it is sad  well society  you gotta blame society  society wants you to look  like the normal person  yeah but not really anymore  the normal fucking family  the normal fucking  you know the two kids  and the husband  i think i think he may have a point  about like mainstream movie star  yeah it's probably hard  to be  one of those guys  has got to come out  and just start  being a movie star  who's also gay  and then everybody else can 
[03:22:30]  yeah whether it's  that guy's gonna lose  i mean  rupert everett kind of did that  and it cost him a lot  you're right  so yeah i think  when did rupert everett do it  like he did  12 years ago  yeah  see i think you can get away  with it now  i'll bet you could  new patrick harris is getting  away with it kind of  exactly  but he's like a broadway dude  so it's different  like if you're that type of guy  it's different than if you're  like will smith  you're an action hero  and stuff  plus he never really lied  about it  like if will smith does it  he'd be like  so you've been fucking  lying to us this whole time  like you have this weird wife 
[03:23:00]  and kids  and that's  right  i mean if you look at our robot  all the robots walk  kind of like feminine  so he's trying to tell us  through that  he's like guys  if you didn't pick up on that  yeah come on  yeah let me go to jimmy in new jersey  he's got a good point  jimmy  hey guys  just wanted to know  how many times have you  taken a girl home  you know  gotten some head  but you know  never did anything else with them  how do you know  if she has a dick or not  exactly  i mean  it may have already happened  it's kind of like the will smiths  we're gonna just pretend 
[03:23:30]  that we don't know  keep up appearances  uh robot  yeah  i robot  uh jimmy  you want one of these dvds  rolling gave me a stack of dvds  i don't think you do  it's  iron man versus hulk  the animated movie  why would you get  you want one  did any of them get their dick sucked  by a tranny hooker  yeah i think  i think uh  iron man does  he gets his robot penis sucked  can i get one of those  yes  hang on jimmy  you get one  hukid gets one  you want one sam  nah not really  yeah i wouldn't either  oh this is hard right here 
[03:24:00]  yeah so  do you know  do you  who could  do you know people  actually know people  not her  do you know people  that are in their trannies  because that does happen  what's his name  from hot 97  kept getting busted  for trannies  mr c right  but it's a medicinal  issue with him  what do you  is that what he said  is that what he said  it's a pill that he takes  and the pill makes him  like run out there  and just pick up dudes  is that right  yeah  that's what he said  that's a really weird  side effect  they should mention  in the commercials 
[03:24:30]  probably  it's glistering  this mouthwash  just has terrible  side effects  i wish the doctor  was there  you always think  that i'd be making  shit up  but there's a pill  that you take  and you chase guys  i'd love to know  what the pill is  it's like why would  you know the side  effect  it's gonna become  the new date rape  drug for dudes  yeah  here no  take a tylenol  hello  i just wish that  somebody out there  in your world  of radio  could call up  and give us  one good reason  why people like  trannies  if you are  if you are  into trannies  please call 
[03:25:00]  866-WOW1-WOW  it's a safe zone  and it's not about  who kid is here  sam morale is here  we'll make you feel better  apparently trannies  is not the politically  correct term anymore  what  that's what i heard  someone's correcting me  what is it  maybe she  i don't know  they didn't give me  a answer  she sounds worse  but little people  also sounds worse  to me than midget  so maybe  yeah  that's a weird one  midget right  yeah  little people  little it's like  that seems more  diminutive than midget  does  absolutely  niggas always  sounds good  to sam though  no it doesn't  why would you  put the word 
[03:25:30]  in my mouth  anyway  this is a fight  we can't fight  yeah i can't be involved  i have a career  to worry about  you you make  a career out of it  i don't know  yo this tranny  thing is a big  epidemic  it's not an epidemic  but it's like  something  epidemic  it's like  the epidemic  of 2013  it was tough  we were fucking  all of them dude  we're over here  saying oh it's okay  it's cool  and who gets like  oh this epidemic  is on these streets man  i probably got my  dick sucked by  i got my dick sucked  like 2,000 times  you think you've had  your dick sucked

[03:29:30]  a good one  you know but  thank you nick  thanks nick  they do say  chinese give the  best head though  well i mean  they gotta really  make up for it  i think  they're like  you know  i i would like  to have a lot  more femininity  about me  and i don't want  any of these  bitches walking  around here  giving better head  right  look at look  at sam's mouth  imagine if he was a  trainee  look i'd probably  be killing it  i could do a lot  for those people  don't fall into 
[03:30:00]  who kids trap  he tries to bring  up my mouth  whenever there's  a comedian in  here  andrew schultz  was in here  the other day  and he was like  yeah he does  have a pretty  mouth  i was like  no dude  don't fall into  the trap  i feel like a lot  of black comics  they confuse me  and schultz  i've been brought  up you know  this guy from  guy code  i'm like  no you don't  i mean for two  seconds when i  came in for the  back  we don't look  alike at all  not at all  you know  i mean i guess  you're both white  and tall 
[03:30:30]  similar features  ish  not yeah  not really  very different  from the back  yeah  no not at all  from the back  i mean their hair  is different  everything's different  they dress differently  yeah  it's all different  um who kid  i saw on your  instagram  have you ever seen  the show sam black  ink  what is it  it's this reality  show and i was  talking about it  the other day  that's what's  freaking out  it's this reality  show on vh1  very ratchet  where it's like  black people  yeah  and they own a  tattoo shop  and it's just like  any other tattoo 
[03:31:00]  reality show  except it's with  black people  yeah  and somehow  it is the most  insane  dramatic  like you can't  believe there's a  character on there  his name he's like  hi what's up  i'm oh shit  yeah  his name is oh shit  like they have  scenes where it's  like they're ball  busting and then  they go to the  confessional part  and the guys in the  confessional going  you know i really  didn't appreciate that  they were making fun  of me because i got  to go to jail next  week  and it's like people  are talking about  going to jail  people are named  profanities  people are having 
[03:31:30]  each other's kids  like it's the  and it's all like  how do they discover  these shows  i have no idea  what producer is out  looking for these  guys  because they go  no it's a tattoo  show  you see  like they've been  full episodes  that are an hour  long  there's a lot  of tattoo shows  on tv right  yeah  isn't that what  a weird genre  but this one  isn't even  they've been  hour long episodes  nobody gets a tattoo  there's no tattoos  given  the new barber shop  or something  is like you hang  there  yeah is there  because for a while  black people didn't  even get tattoos  yeah  because let's be 
[03:32:00]  honest  i think the rock  i guess rock  took over the  tats  you know the rock  world  and the fucking  the bikers  because that's the  thing now in hip-hop  is like a lot of  black people want to  dress like rock stars  but like 10 years  ago  now we wear like  tight leather pants  we got skirts  the leotards  you know what i'm  saying  so  but black people  used to realize  that  like the complexion  is different  a lot of tattoos  are very difficult  to see on black  people  there's not  that's why i was  like trying to  figure out  because my skin  is kind of  do you have tattoos 
[03:32:30]  it's like a brownish  yeah i got my  whole back done  so what's in your  bag  i got the haitian  flag back there  yeah  haiti pride right  yeah yeah  you know what i'm  saying  did little way  start this whole thing  because i feel like  little wayne was the  first guy wearing like  you know leggings  on stage like an  80s rock star  and he's covered in  tattoos  yeah like i think he  started with i think  his first tat was like  a cupcake  on his left shoulder  is that right  but now the whole body  is covered  that's a weird tattoo  choice to start with  i mean come on man  man gucci man has 
[03:33:00]  ice cream coat  with a lightning bolt  though  i'm scared i'd be  scared to spend that  kind of money  you see these nba  players come in now  and they're like  they're like one year  in on a rookie  contract  and they're like  all tatted up  i'm like aren't you  gonna feel stupid  if you blow your  knee out or something  right  like there's no  you can't sell that  back like you can  buy jewelry if you  want use your  ignorant money for  that you can at  least sell it back  to someone  yeah i think it  doesn't seem like  at least if you  buy a house or  something at least  you can sell that  you know  it's not a good  investment this tattoo  i'm really shocked  like the nba  association never  put like a lien 
[03:33:30]  or a fine foot  over like too many  tasks i'm gonna be  like they look like  rap artists  i think they tried to  at first didn't they  at some point  they always try to  as they call it  hip-hop culture  to kind of you  know subdue that  a little bit  where they're just  like you gotta wear  a suit when you're  injured and then  they wear like  ridiculous suits  like whatever  we can't do  anything about this  right and then  what's his name  comes in with  caprice on  who did  who was it  sal  oh sal's not in  there we were  talking about him  the other day  he's uh 
[03:34:00]  we play for the  heat  yeah  yeah the high  water joint  yeah who am i  talking about  uh you're talking  about uh  fuck he's so  dwayne wade  yeah he comes  out with like  south beach  so maybe you get  his pass  high water capris  and logan  dude there have  been pictures of  of of dwayne  wade wearing the  exact same outfit  as a chick at a  fashion show  like like wearing  the little blazer  that kind of poofs  out at the bottom  like it's cut so  that a woman can  have a small waist  and it can come  out on her thighs  they can get  away with  athletes can get  away with murder  because they're  like well dwayne 
[03:34:30]  wade they'll be  like he's a  trend center you  know yeah he's  always in like  fashion blogs  i don't know i  think trend  trend center i  don't know if  he's into trannies  over i don't know  if he's into  trannies or not  but this black  ink show it's  like like you  said like the  tattooing shows  is a whole new  genre but most of  the shows people  actually get tattooed  right on black  ink they don't get  tattooed they just  end up going to  jail or having kids  or or the girls  get into fights with  each other constantly  but i will watch  the show  non-stop it's on 
[03:35:00]  vh1  okay vh1 and by  the way  okay you should  look at it seems  to me like vh1 is  doing a lot to  exploit black people  all the like love  and hip-hop and  black tattoo or  whatever that show  is called and all  this stuff it's just  like look watch black  people fight with  each other  you know man they  monopolize them for  what we do you see  me with a chain  right i gotta save  you two things  this is ignorance  it's ignorance  ignorance  i had white people  fighting with each  other for years  on tv now they're  like black people  like now it's our  time right yeah  yeah maybe that is  maybe that's black 
[03:35:30]  people standing up  for their rights  it's all term  motherfuckers  we can look like  idiots too  and matter of fact  we can do it  better than you can  there's never been  an ignorant white  show that  no there have  been plenty of  the real world  yeah we started  i mean there's  there's so many  also uh  i mean  i mean they  had basketball  wives on  on the h1  that was the one  i watched when i  was like i can't  believe this is a  fucking shit  yeah like these  so i feel like  these women are  already taking  advantage of  of their 
[03:36:00]  of their you  know  husband's fame  yeah  yeah  it's out of  control out  there  so how did  housewives  same shit  same  yeah that's  the white  ignorant show  all those real  housewife shows  people don't  and they don't  have  besides atlanta  they don't have  drama they just  create drama  like there'll be  a whole episode  around like she  didn't invite me  to this party  so i'm not gonna  invite her to my  party  and just the  drama leading up  to that  and then they're  fighting like  and you watch it  though you're  like oh shit  yeah i'm like  this is stupid  then she shows up  i'm like oh shit  this is gonna be  awkward  are the fights 
[03:36:30]  actually real  no  they're all  scripted  for real  no  yeah  it's all bs  it's complete  shit  i'm sure some of  the people really  hate each other  but they're like  you gotta act  extra mad  they gotta do  takes  they're just  perez hilton  is getting a  reality show right  and it's all  uh it's like  gay husbands  or gay parents  or something like  that it's all  it's supposed to  be about him  and his gay dude  friends that have  kids  oh okay  they're casting  for his friends  right now 
[03:37:00]  what  yes  they're all fake  fake friends  everybody on the  show is fake  all these reality  shows are fake  but the reason i  brought up black ink  was because i was  on your instagram  and you were at  the black ink  tattoo place  yesterday  for my life  it was crazy  my whole back  is like bleeding  right now  that's where you  got the haitian flag  yeah i got it  over here  can we see it  uh yeah i gotta  take a lot of  shit off  it's like padding  oh it's all  is it colored in  or is it  i gotta go back  for the color  oof  did it really hurt  a lot  i was screaming  my asshole 
[03:37:30]  they film it  for the show  they had a baby  in the room  i was screaming  see that's what  i mean  jesus  that's what i mean  have you been  to tattoo shops  before  no i'm kinda  i'm kinda  i hate needles  i've been to a few  never seen a baby  in one of them  but the black ink  tattoo shop  the baby was like  where's my daddy  that's pretty weird  there should have  been a baby there  well i was here  a baby in the  black ink tattoo shop  i have no idea  but the girl was  like where's my daddy  my god  was it filmed  yeah i mean uh 
[03:38:00]  i think i'm in  the next episode  coming out  in the december  or january  wow  that's exciting  screaming and crying  and you know  i want to go back  with you  i want to meet  those people  i'm a fan  film uh  in harlem  which i didn't  know that  and i wore my  cane up there  and i tucked it  in  yeah but didn't  they have like  a tv crew  around or something  or is it not  the only white  people  the tv crew  after that  yo man let me  hold that camera  for a second  yo let me see  that camera  that's a nice  camera  i got one  let me show  you this  let me show 
[03:38:30]  just run away  with your camera  harlem was pretty  different than it  was even 10  years ago though  i mean you go  up there and  you're like this  is not the same  no you can  you can survive  way past 125th  street now  no problem  you can walk  around there  it's normal  for white people  to walk in  at least in daylight  probably after dark  it still gets a  little weird  well yeah  i don't think  it's you don't  think it's bad  i don't think  it's that big  a deal anymore  no  why do they  tour buses  go into harlem  like i don't  understand that  well because  it's like a  famous place  like everybody 
[03:39:00]  knows what  harlem is  it is full  of white people  like i don't  understand  mace made  harlem famous  right  yeah but  harlem world  biggie made  brooklyn famous  obviously like  white people  going to brooklyn  yeah well  white people  took over brooklyn  i mean you  don't get the  vacation  part of the time  have you been  to williamsburg  it's outrageous  there's dads  in skinny jeans  white people  are taking over  bushwick  bushwick was  like the shit  that's crazy  there was a guy 
[03:39:30]  named bushwick bill  you didn't fuck  with bushwick bill  yeah white people  they're ridiculous  white people  are in bushwick  now and they're  like it's so fun  i'm like it would  not be like that  10 years ago  no way  it's fun  what's fun about it  they're part of  this bohemian  uprising or  something  that's crazy  i didn't know  that you guys  are coming up  and it's not a  bohemian uprising  they're going in  like columbus did  and they're just  taking over  territories and  trying to sell  people in the  projects bridges  for 35 cents  what are they  doing raising a  rent and kicking  everybody out  yeah 
[03:40:00]  okay i mean  they're taking over  they're increasing  property value  property tax goes  up and then  opening up little  cafes and that's  just fucking the  neighborhoods up  now they're like  oh we got this  scone shop now  so now it's an  extra 300 a month  and you know what  they do too  they bring magicians  in to the cafes  and they have  them do street  magic and the  black people just  run away  yeah i know  can i do it for real  no not for real  it's a joke  just kidding  bringing magicians 
[03:40:30]  to scare away  black people  i just did a lot  of weird shit  this week man  i just been all  over the place  where were you  nah i've just  been like running  on every tv show  walling out  yeah i saw you  were on sway's  tv show too  i didn't even  know he had a  tv show  yeah on tv  yeah  so uh yeah  i just saw a  video of that  guy sway uh  talking to kanye  west did you see  that  what the fuck  was that  that video's  gone egg  video's got over  two million hits  on it  yeah apparently  kanye started  yelling about  fashion and sway  was like well  i have a question  and kanye took 
[03:41:00]  offense to that  what is what is  the deal with  kanye i mean  what do you think  about him  he feels like  in this machine  that we all  wake up to  and work in  and survive  and the world  you mean  exactly  it's got us  all enslaved  so he probably  just met  whoever controlled  all this shit  and they told him  oh like  you're the same  motherfucker  and then he just  went crazy  like he was at  a billionaire's party  and he went crazy  he met some guy  like he got a taste  of the illuminati  yeah the guy  came up to him  and was like  yo man i saw  your video son 
[03:41:30]  you run this shit  motherfucker  you're a slave  he's like crazy  he seems like  he has a pretty good  life for a slave  though  i gotta  oh yeah  i'll be that slave  right now  so like jay-z  saw the taste  of the illuminati  and he was like  i like the way  this tastes  let me join  this secret society  you got  let me take  over the world  whereas kanye  he's like  what the fuck  is this  yeah he seems  i'm a slave  he seems very  sensitive  he seems like  he's kind of  losing it  every time i see him  he feels like  if he doesn't  continue to wild out  because he's not 
[03:42:00]  getting support  from nike  and all the  major corporations  that if nike  will say  yo kanye  is hot  then he's hot  but don't they  kind of  i'm not saying  that  who cares  he's selling out  venues  like what difference  does it make  he feels like  it's temporary  doesn't he feel  so save a little  money  stop buying  fucking jesus  pieces  isn't there  like  he seems a little  too insecure  to be a hardcore  rapper  he's always been  like that  he's always been  like insecure  that's true 
[03:42:30]  he was the one  that kind of  ushered in  letting rappers  be kind of  mama's boys  and insecure  and wearing  you know  gucci backpacks  and polo shirts  and  that's part of  dating kim kardashian  you gotta get  the hottest chick  he's like  gotta be that dude  he's always like  what do they think  of me  what are they  saying about me  that's true  and then you see  other rappers  and you're like  well this guy  he doesn't really  care  and that makes  him cooler  which is weird  too  because  you gotta turn  your sound off  kanye west  is uh  like he's  kanye west 
[03:43:00]  is like  better than  everybody  you know  what i mean  is he  is he considered  a great rapper  i think he's  like one of the  best  he's uh  yeah he's a  genius  he's like  one of the  illest  except  except  except like  rap people  like who kid  they don't like  to admit  that he's the  best  because he's  not like  believe it or  not  i actually  was with him  before he  flipped his  car  and then  everything  switched up  because i  told him  he was  rack  you did  at my  session  and he  got mad  you thought  he was  whack  no but  back in  the days  though  but he  you know 
[03:43:30]  he was  supposed to  do a  beat for  me  but  speed it  up  i had  ludicrous  in the  studio  and ludicrous  was like  yo i want  to do  your song  but who's  this guy  rapping  in the  booth  and it's  kanye  number one  plus two  and i'm  going in  goo goo  he was doing  all these  weird raps  and i was  like yo  so i didn't  know him  so i went  in there  and cursed  him  i was like  yo you  whack  so i told  him to  wait outside  and i'm  gonna film  him  and i found  the tape  like 10  years later  and i put  it online  where is it  you can google  it  before the  crash  it's called  because you  know he  crashed and 
[03:44:00]  then he  blew up  his face  right and  he did  the song  through the  wire with  his jaws  wired shut  i was with  him before  he flipped  his car  i told  him he  was  whack  and he  got mad  i got it  on video  so it's  called  if you  youtube  kanye  west  before the  crash  i filmed  him in  the car  and everything  like in  the video  he stated  this is 10  years ago  by the way  so he  was driving  like angrily  and that's  so you  kind of  behind  he had a  rental car  up you  know  he had a  bmw  and i filmed  he was  rented  was he 
[03:44:30]  loaded  then or  no  he was  getting  money  for  production  but the  fact is  he sped  off  but i  filmed  everything  in the  video  he's  like  i'm  gonna  be  with  jay-z  i'm  gonna  like  take  care  of  my  artist  everybody's  gonna  be  on my  dick  from  my  clothing  and  this  is  10  years ago  and he's  doing all  that today  so you  gotta respect  on some  level that  he's still  that dude  10 years ago  like 10  years ago  he was just  as obnoxious  as he is  now  exactly  but now  he's  famous  so we  expect him  to stop 
[03:45:00]  being obnoxious  and to kind  of be like  okay yeah  i just  want to make  sure i  keep my  fans  he's  like  fuck  that  at least  he's  being  himself  exactly  but there's  also it's  like i said  those that  seem to be  the dudes  that make  it are  the ones  that are  like i'm  the fucking  best i'm  gonna step  on everybody  to get to  where i am  it's kind  of it's  kind of a  little  disheartening  you know  that's what  you need  to do  you need  to start  going into  the cellar  and being  like getting  up on stage  and being  like fuck  all these  other comics  they're not  good  i'm a slave  to you  i don't want  to go up  now i want  to go up  20 minutes
