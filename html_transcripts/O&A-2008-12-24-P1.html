<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion on home security, fueled by recent Tri-State area break-ins.  The hosts and callers shared personal anecdotes, ranging from sensible precautions to elaborate, almost paranoid security systems.  The conversation veered into graphic details about Richard Ramirez's crimes.  This segued into a discussion about men's views on relationships, with Patrice O'Neal's analogy comparing girlfriends to cars and sneakers, employing demeaning language towards women who gain weight.  A substantial portion was dedicated to dissecting a 1975 "how to pick up women" tape, filled with offensive and outdated pickup lines, drawing criticism from the hosts and callers.  Opie's purported ability to guess a woman's age by looking at her "taint" became a recurring joke, tested with a caller.  The segment ended with Anthony boasting about his new Mustang, his speeding, and critiques of *Pimp My Ride*'s later seasons.

The show then transitioned into a discussion about roadside memorials, with callers expressing varying opinions ranging from discomfort to solemn remembrance. This led to a discussion of CMT's "Trick My Truck," generating jokes about the show's participants. A caller defended New Jersey against perceived insults aimed at Cleveland.  The conversation shifted to "ghost bikes," prompting a debate on their perceived creepiness and the possibility of stealing one.  A large portion of the show was devoted to a profane and absurd riff on "Snakes on a Plane,"  featuring caller-generated, increasingly ridiculous movie title suggestions (e.g., "Bees in a Car," "Possums in the Bank," "Tarantulas on the Escalator").  A short, purported interview with Samuel L. Jackson about the film was played.  The hosts and callers engaged in a prolonged, expletive-laden comedic bit revolving around the film's premise.  The segment concluded with Anthony recounting his experience at a Renaissance Festival, highlighting the attendees' attire, the lack of Black people, and his interactions with fans.  This was followed by jokes about archery, hatchet throwing, and further speculation about festival attendees.  A hypothetical NRA-themed restaurant was discussed, furthering the show's irreverent humor.


The final segment largely focused on brainstorming menu items for the aforementioned fictional NRA-themed restaurant. Opie, Anthony, and several callers generated a long list of morbidly humorous menu items, named after infamous shootings and assassinations, often using puns (e.g., "Sirhan Sirhanwich," "The Jeffrey Dahmer Sampler," "The Columbine Sloppy Joe," "The Manson Massacre Meatloaf," "John Wilkes Booth").  The bit included numerous references to firearms and violence, incorporating firearm-related promotions and gimmicks.  Callers actively participated, contributing additional dark humor. The segment concluded with the hosts acknowledging the sheer amount of dark humor and needing a break.

[00:08:00]  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  or they came in through an open garage door, or a side door was left open.  We had one of those today.  I think it was in Brooklyn.  Yep.  Older couple left some window open to their study.  Back window, yeah, it was open behind that.  What are you leaving windows open for?  The undesirables.  Lock them up.  Climb through the window, tie up the old couple, and ask where was the safe. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  So Kenny, of course, the secret agent man.  Secret agent man, they're giving you a number and taking away your name.  You know, he's an expert.  He goes, inside job.  Inside job?  Yeah, because the criminals were asking about a safe.  That's true.  Inside job.  They knew something about this home.  But this couple left a little window open.  You can't do that in the tri-state area.  Don't you leave windows open. 
[00:09:00]  You can do it in the suburbs.  You really can.  No.  You really can.  No.  You can't in Manhattan.  Man, pretty much every building, the first five floors have bars on the windows.  You just can't do it in Manhattan.  You can't do it in the suburbs.  Unless you have a window with bars in front of it, of course.  Look what happened in Westbury today.  Home invasion.  Home invasion.  Look at Richard Ramirez.  I agree with Ant.  Lock him up.  The Night Stalker would look for open windows like that, and he would tuck his stupid jeans 
[00:09:30]  into his sock so he didn't, like, leave, like, little filaments.  Fibers.  Yeah.  And knock things over.  Wow.  And that's what they look for.  I mean, those guys that are, like, predatorial rapists and stuff, look for an open window.  The worst story concerning, and I believe it was him, was that the older woman and the  shotgun.  Oh, yeah, that was Ramirez.  Oh, my God.  Ramirez comes in.  Here he is.  You know, this guy's been raping and murdering, and she pulls out her.  Well, first, her husband is asleep on a couch in the other room. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Or something.  So Ramirez, I think, blasts him.  Yep.  And I think she's in the bedroom, and she hears it.  Yeah.  And so she, again, then she goes under the bed and gets the shotgun.  Gets the shotgun, points it at Ramirez, who's walking through the door, pulls the trigger.  Nothing.  Click.  Apparently, they had had some children over the house the previous day, and the husband  had unloaded the shotgun.  Could have ended his reign of terror right there, and what do you hear? 
[00:10:30]  Click.  Instead, she should have just, I mean, if she would have known it was unloaded, she could  have just pointed at it and said, get out!  And I'm sure he would have ran away.  Yeah, maybe.  He wasn't ready for the old broad to have a shotgun.  Was it like in the movies when it went click, he just, like, smiled, smiled real big?  Come on, Grandma.  I hope not.  He had bad teeth.  That's the last thing you want to see.  Sure.  His rotted mouth.  All right.  Here's the latest home invasion on Long Island.  This is what horrifies Anthony.  Oh.  On Long Island, police are investigating another home invasion.  This is what happened in Westbury. 
[00:11:00]  Cops say three men, one armed with a gun, pushed into the home at about 5.30 last night.  The attackers left with an undetermined amount of valuables.  Nobody's hurt, but the crime in broad daylight has left the neighborhood shaken.  We hear about things like that all the time.  You never think it's going to be, you know, right across.  Say, say.  It's an unusual thing happen for the neighborhood.  It started being scary because, you know.  This ain't my neighborhood.  Young kids and everything to move out. 
[00:11:30]  That's for sure.  Investigators say it's too early to tell if this home invasion is linked to one over the weekend  that left two people in the hospital.  See, you hear that one guy?  He goes, you know, you hear about these things on the news, but you never think it's going to be you.  I do.  I sit there and think it's going to be me.  So you prepare.  Lock up.  Cameras.  I just called my security guy.  Cameras.  Yeah, there's preparing and then there's being a psychopath like yourself. 
[00:12:00]  No, no, no.  Psychopath.  Yeah, I have a contingency plan.  Do you know he was telling me before the show that he has pretty much markings on the floor  where he wants his chick to stand?  I've blocked my house like a movie.  What?  I'm blocking in my house like a movie.  He's got marks on the floor, so if he's not there and the alarm goes off,  he's told his chick, you stand on that mark with the shotgun.  I say, if that alarm goes off, we have the cordless phone. 
[00:12:30]  I'm worried about clipping the wires or anything like that.  You are to immediately grab the shotgun, rack it, and go right here.  And I point it to a spot that gives her perfect cover and a perfect vantage point of the front  locked door of the bedroom because we sleep in our bedroom with the door locked.  So that way, you know, they're going to have to come through, you know, the bedroom door also.  So as that's happening, you know, now the security, the alarm's going off, so the cops are on the way. 
[00:13:00]  And she can, you know, hunker down and hold off anybody that might be trying to get into the bedroom.  And if they do successfully come through the door, she's ready to blast away.  But what if it's you?  What if you forgot something at home?  I do think, you know, once I...  I'm sure you have this scenario.  I set the alarm.  I call.  I call first before I come in the house.  And I say, I forgot something. 
[00:13:30]  Could you, you know, disable the alarm and let me in?  It's me.  I'm very safe.  This is going to end ugly someday.  No, I'm very safe.  Some poor neighbor with a bunch of cake.  Very safe.  Very safe.  Hello, anyone?  Bam!  Very safe.  It's only intruders.  Yeah, I mean, you've got to be cautious, unfortunately, because especially since you're a celebrity, you're a target.  I mean, it's a reality.  You've got to be...  That's right.  All right.  You, on the other hand, are ready for, you know, things that you probably never need to be ready for, you know.  Well, thank you. 
[00:14:00]  I told her if they're rappelling in from the roof, she has to hide from this vantage point.  All right.  Well, you never know where they're coming from.  Let's go to Carpio in Brooklyn.  Carpio.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  The detail you forgot to mention about the Ramirez scene is right after she pulls the trigger and it clicks,  he was so enraged about her attempts to kill him that he cut her eyeballs out and then saved them in, like, a little jewelry box that they found. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, I didn't even know that.  Jesus.  That would enrage somebody like him.  Like, wow, she almost killed me.  Right.  The nerve, yeah.  This was after he had raped her and beat her up.  Oh, did he rape her, too?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he raped all ladies.  There was one case.  Who were the two old women?  They were asleep and he broke into their, they were, like, in their 80s.  And he breaks into their place and he takes a lamp and just caves both their heads in with a lamp.  Like, they were in their 80s. 
[00:15:00]  He was just a dick.  Yeah.  Was there ever any interviews or anything with him as to, like, what type of lunatic he was?  Oh, sure there were.  He gets wedding proposals all the time in jail.  Oh, my God.  These women.  Women, you dummies.  You always want, I want a nice guy.  And here's a man with rotted teeth who raped and murdered old ladies.  And cave in their skulls and cut their eyeballs out.  Why are we laughing extra hard?  I don't know.  It's just always funny.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chrissy in Jersey. 
[00:15:30]  Chrissy, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I love the show.  Thank you, Chrissy.  I just want, you were talking about how in suburban areas it might be a little safer,  but I live in a very safe neighborhood and our house got broken into.  The kids came through the garage and then our garage door, like, to the house was unlocked.  See?  Why?  Our jewelry.  Oh, God.  You know, you got your garage doors.  Now, sometimes those things can be compromised. 
[00:16:00]  They're electronic with the garage door opener.  And then maybe you got a keypad also with a little code that can open it up if you don't  have your little remote.  And then there are things that on older ones, the guys can sit down the street and actually  read your remote codes and punch them in and open your garage door.  So you should never.  We didn't have anything like that.  We just, they just forced open the window in the garage.  See, the window in the garage.  And then why then was the door between the garage and the house left unlocked? 
[00:16:30]  Because we always did.  It was never a problem.  And now we lock it all the time, obviously.  You've got to lock it.  Never leave the keys in the garage because if they get in the garage, then they got your  keys.  And always keep that door locked.  Or hide them somewhere really good.  No.  Like when there's a thing, we would always hide the keys.  We would put them under a paint can with keys written on the wall and an arrow pointed  down.  And the arrow, keys under paint can.  Yes, in parentheses.  Parentheses.  I side more with you on the security issue. 
[00:17:00]  I'm kind of paranoid.  High security for me.  I've read too many serial killer books to know, boy, once they get a hold of you, oh.  I could not imagine being in that situation of utter terror and complete lack of control  of the situation because you weren't prepared.  If it never happens to me, God bless.  Let me say, God bless.  You're such a liar.  But.  You want it to happen to you so you can like, blam, blam, blam, blam.  If I got to.  Take that.  Blam. 
[00:17:30]  If I got to take out one of these animals.  You dream about it.  One of these animals that terrorized someone.  It would be great.  Oh, Doug.  But please.  Fantastic.  You secretly want it to happen.  I.  I.  Be honest.  I'd shoot him like that scene in Pulp Fiction.  But be honest.  And just let him let him ride around on the floor going.  Do you.  Do you secretly think about it knowing you're going to be OK and your girl's going to be  OK?  But you're secretly OK.  You're secretly thinking this would be kind of cool.  No, actually, I really wouldn't. 
[00:18:00]  I would.  I mean, it supposedly really screws you up for the rest of your life if you kill somebody.  Go figure.  I don't even like hearing like a thud, thud under my tires and not looking back to see  if it was a little squirrel or something.  Makes me feel that all day.  How about the guy whose son came home like when his wife was home and his son came home  the night before from college early.  Yeah.  And the father didn't know and shot him in the kitchen or something.  Well, the father knew.  He just didn't like the kid.  I heard the kid's report cards weren't up to snuff.  Tuition's very expensive. 
[00:18:30]  The thing is, you have to identify your target.  Shooting through doors is unacceptable.  Shooting blindly in the dark.  You got to know who or what your target is.  That's why you can't just go blasting through a window.  Or there was one guy who set up some wacky goddamn coyote from the contraption from Roadrunner  where a shotgun was pointed at his window with a trigger, a string connected to the window  with like a pulley. 
[00:19:00]  And his son went to climb through the window and kablooey.  There he goes.  Well, we got one of those on the phones here.  JP.  Hey, what's up, bud?  What's up?  Listen, my uncle's all into electronics and everything.  And he was noticing that, you know, stuff was getting moved around every time he left  the house and everything like that.  So he puts all these remote sensors under his deck because apparently he'd be coming  in through the basement window.  So it turns out that it was the mayor's son. 
[00:19:30]  And the mayor lives next door to him.  And he was coming into the basement.  And the remote sensor, you know, got him coming in underneath the deck, closed the piece  of lattice work that goes around the deck.  Yeah.  Trapped him under the deck all day.  And when the mayor, his father, finally came home, he said, you know, somebody's been  breaking into my house.  And I kind of think it's your son.  And he starts saying, oh, he would never do that.  He would never do that.  So he goes, you know, it's funny because it kind of sounds like him underneath the deck. 
[00:20:00]  He had him trapped under there all day.  He actually had a cage type thing that came down under the deck.  It was the whole deck was surrounded by lattice work.  And he put like a remote laser sensor across it.  So as soon as he tripped the sensor, it just closed him in under the deck all day.  That's great.  Yeah.  But what happened?  Did it affect the mayor's political career?  You know, I don't know.  I think he pretty much kept his mouth shut.  Food!  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Ralph in Holbrook. 
[00:20:30]  Ralph.  Hey there, Ralph.  What's up, McDonald's boys?  Hey, Andy, why don't you get a dog?  You could be like Monty Burns from The Simpsons.  Ha ha, that means he would have to care for something.  A dog?  Exactly.  What would I do when I'm away?  Where would I, what would I do?  Go to a kennel?  Put it in a kennel?  What do I do when...  Marge wouldn't help you out.  What do I do when a dog takes a big doggy dump on the floor?  What do I do when a dog eats through a couch that is now taking me upwards of eight months 
[00:21:00]  to get?  What do I do then?  Eight months?  Eight months so far.  What's that made out of baby skin?  What's the matter with you?  Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.  I'm actually surprised you don't have a dog.  What?  Just a big, nasty, like, Rottweiler or something.  More damage to the house.  If they're well-trained, they're not that bad, dude.  Plus, anything that gets damaged, you can just have fixed.  Who's going to walk it?  Not me.  You wouldn't want to walk a massive dog.  And then you walk a dog in the rain. 
[00:21:30]  Who's going to pet it?  You know what a wet dog smells like in your house?  Yes, I've dated women.  I know what it's like when they get off the exercise bike.  I am not having a wet, nasty-smelling dog ruin my luxurious house.  Leave them on the back.  Get a nice little doghouse for them.  Have a nice one built.  No.  Let them poop in the yard.  Then you can run barefoot through it and yell, Tee-hee.  Guns don't crap on your floor.  That's true.  But, you know, you don't accidentally shoot relatives with a dog either. 
[00:22:00]  It's going to happen.  Your mom walks in accidentally and he drops a log on her foot.  Everybody laughs.  If my mom comes in and she's acting like a burglar, she deserves to get shot.  It's funny she comes in with one of those old-school burglar masks.  Like the one in the Hamburglar mask.  The mask.  Carrying out a bag with a dollar sign on it.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The world of O.B. and Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  Look at this.  We got Tugboat the Trucker.  Tugboat.  Hey, guys.  How come you guys don't treat your female fans better?  Are you kidding me?  I think we do.  Oh, come on, man.  Happy Typing Girl knocks herself to death for you guys behind the scenes.  And I never hear you guys give her props.  She's busting her ass.  Because she refuses to get naked.  Are you insane, sir?  Am I insane?  Do you know that we were all laughing our asses off on Pal Talk last night for hours on end? 
[00:23:00]  That is the kind of thanks I give.  I go beyond this program and get on Pal Talk.  And we were all laughing and laughing last night.  That's how I show my appreciation to the fans.  I've seen you there in your palatial mansion and knocking all the crap out of us poor guys.  We do love Happy Typing Girl.  She does a lot for the show.  Of course.  Freak out of character for a second. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, Patrice was talking about relationships and girlfriends during the break.  His analogy was amazing.  They're always hysterical, always unbelievable, yet completely true when it comes to Patrice.  You are in your own little world as far as the world of romance goes, the world of love, the world of mating.  It's the world of animals.  Yeah.  Just be an animal.  And all you have to do is, as an animal, what we do other than dolphins is we communicate. 
[00:24:00]  And you just communicate what you feel.  My girlfriend's gaining a little weight.  She said, will you leave me?  I said, yes, because I found you not fat.  And if you get fat, see, getting a girl who's already fat is different from watching your girl become fat.  It's like buying an old car is vintage.  Watching your car get old, get rid of that piece of mess.  It's got miles on it unless somebody else call it vintage. 
[00:24:30]  Dude, you're getting rid of this vintage 94?  Now, you're giving it to somebody who wants that.  Who wants that vintage.  But I have my girl new off the shelf.  She can keep it polished.  New girl smell.  New girl smell.  Everything, right.  I don't want to watch her become what somebody else is going to do.  I didn't buy this car with a dented bumper.  That's right.  But I got it.  It was a perfect bumper.  That's Patrice.  So as he's saying this, I'll just laugh because he is the most like, I've never heard any guy actually speak like that. 
[00:25:00]  Do your sneaker analogy.  That brings it home.  It's pretty much the same thing.  I know it's the same thing.  It's vintage.  It's not vintage if you watch it become old.  If you have it when it's from new to old, that is just a raggedy piece of garbage.  But if I see something, you know what?  Give the vintage to the Chinese people that want your old nights. 
[00:25:30]  Do you understand what I'm saying?  So my girl is saying to me, I'm like, I'm not mature enough because I am with you because you're a hot girl.  If you become not hot, you become a fat girl, then I can go get a fat girl who functions being a fat girl.  She's vintage.  So when your sneakers get old, you throw them away and you get a brand new pair of sneakers.  Or what we do in the hood is you hang them over the telephone wire. 
[00:26:00]  That's what I do to my girl if she gets too fat.  There's a bunch of girls just hung over telephone wires.  I'm going to tie them together.  I'm going to tie them together by the legs.  Throws them up there.  They swing around a few times.  I'm not here to be mature like that.  She serves a purpose.  I love her, but she serves a purpose, man.  Fat girls, some fat girls like being fat.  They move well fat.  They know how to look good fat.  She's a good looking girl.  And those are for the guys that want the vintage.  That want vintage. 
[00:26:30]  Now, my girl, a fat version of my girl, she will walk out on the streets and somebody will pick her up in a second.  But they don't realize she's vintage to them.  That they like that.  She's just an old fat bitch to me.  So you just told your broad if she gains weight, she's out.  Oh, man.  I didn't tell her if she gains weight.  She's gaining weight.  And she asked me, she's getting nervous.  And I said, you should be absolutely nervous.  Wow.  You've got balls.  That is...  There's so many guys listening right now going, I wish I had the balls to say that. 
[00:27:00]  You should be nervous.  And she knows it.  All right.  Well, picking up girls.  Made easy.  1975.  If we don't play some of this audio thing, we're going to really piss off some people.  Maybe Patrice ought to take some of this to heart.  Right.  Here we go.  So this was an educational film that came out in 1975.  I think they were just tapes, audio tapes and books that you used to be able to buy  to give you a better edge when you go out there to pick up women.  And they were just really full of crap.  This is from 1975. 
[00:27:30]  The street pickup.  Is this pre-AIDS?  Learn how to do the hustle.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Everything has to be PA.  Is it PA or BA?  Is it PA or...  It's pre-AIDS, man.  It's pre-AIDS.  It has to be pre-AIDS.  There's books like this that made AIDS.  Here's the intro.  How big it is.  Here's the intro to the street pickup.  There are a few basic principles that you have to master before you can move on to wild,  uninhibited street play.  First, it's important to remember not to get greedy.  Pick a girl whose outfit and style you really like, so when you make your move, she'll 
[00:28:00]  instinctively know you're sincere and mean it.  Remember, girls like guys who know what they want.  And a girl likes to think you think she's something special.  There's a second general rule for street pickups, and that's having a relaxed approach.  You've got to keep cool and act casual.  Not so casual that the girl doesn't think you're interested.  Peter Brady.  But offhand enough, so you don't alarm her. 
[00:28:30]  Alarm her?  You're going to scare her.  First of all, this guy sounds like he knows nothing.  Yeah.  Absolutely not.  His voice is cracking.  His voice is cracking.  He's a dullard.  He's a nerd.  A nerd.  But there is a natural, we have to just dig with nature.  There's a natural point to what he's saying.  Basically, it has to be a ground between confident and humble.  Right.  You have to figure out a way, and that's what men haven't done. 
[00:29:00]  We don't, we don't, there has to be a proper, you know what, I could get you, and a proper,  you know what, but I want you, but I know I could get you.  So it can't be too much, I'm better than you, and it can't be too much, hey, can I possibly  take you for some coffee because you're gorgeous?  It has to be a middle ground, like, look, man, let's be honest here.  I could get you.  Yeah.  And your life ain't going nowhere.  And you've got to emote that.  So you've got to step up with that.  Yeah.  You've got to emote that.  You've got to put that out.  Well, good old Mike hits the street, and he does some acting as he looks at girls. 
[00:29:30]  Picking up girls' media in 1975.  In 1975.  I think we have that right here.  All right.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  The bone.  Dig it.  Is that your little brother?  Sure.  He's a good-looking kid.  Always compliment their honor beverages.  This is great iced tea.  Here we go. 
[00:30:00]  Let's watch Mike in action in downtown Dallas when he was in town on business, and it looked  to him like every secretary in town was taking her Texas-sized s*** for a lunch hour exercise  walk.  Yeah, dig it.  Texas-sized cans.  Oh, brother.  Look at those knockers.  Yeah, I don't think that works.  No.  Well...  Did he say it right to her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's supposed to be Mike on the street looking at girls. 
[00:30:30]  I guess that's not how to do it.  Look at those knockers.  Jesus.  And those.  Look at the points on those.  No bra on that chick.  There's another one.  She's got a parrot.  Jesus.  Well, these Texas chicks are too much.  Whoops.  Mike's forgotten rule number one, and he's just spinning his wheels.  Don't forget, you've got to make a decisive choice. 
[00:31:00]  After all, you're not girl watching.  Mike's like the donkey who's starving because it can't choose between two bales of Texas hay.  It's only an ass that can't make hay in Dallas, Mike.  Ha ha.  Oh, my God.  Does this stink?  Wow, this guy is awful.  This stinks.  With that monotone, no personality voice.  But has it changed?  No.  Has it changed?  No.  Everyone knows.  Every guy knows you can't just go up to a girl and say nice.  This isn't anything new. 
[00:31:30]  No, that guy didn't.  He's just looking.  The Mike guy is going, that's not what you do there, buddy.  It's like this guy is to himself going, I want those knockers.  Ooh, I want those.  He's going, hey, stupid.  You don't just want.  You can get.  With my, you keep listening, you're going to be able to walk up to one of these Texas beauties  and make a move, and it's going to work.  Let's get to the next clip here.  Picking up Girls Made Easy, 1975. 
[00:32:00]  More acting.  Excuse me, I wonder if you'd tell me where you get your hair done.  What?  Your hair.  It's perfect.  I'd like to know where you get it done.  It's beautiful and just perfect for the job.  Perfect for what job?  A second ago, this groovy chick was just a girl in his dreams.  Now Mike's managed to intrigue and flatter her.  And scare her.  The most lovely and least complimented, because her breasts usually get all the attention, 
[00:32:30]  feature, her hair.  But Mike plays it very cool and keeps spinning his web.  Uh, let me explain.  Web.  I'm an advertising executive, and we're down here in Dallas looking for girls with hair as pretty as yours.  To use in our, uh, shampoo commercials on television.  They also mention that he's got a wife back in, uh, Idaho.  This is worse than, could you help me put this couch in the van?  We're here.  Okay, that guy was, that was Opie Hughes. 
[00:33:00]  That was Opie.  He was using his Opie-ness.  His Opie-ness.  To get him his chit-chit.  That wasn't Greg Hughes.  He wasn't Greg Hughes.  The actor that plays Opie.  He was Opie in it.  That was being Opie because he was lying.  Because he was saying I'm bad.  He's not an ad exec.  He's spinning a web.  He was saying he's really an ad exec.  But he was.  He's using what he knows best, which is his career.  How did we know?  Did he mention that he was an ad exec?  He's not.  I think he's lying.  No.  You can't lie to the broads.  That might become your girlfriend. 
[00:33:30]  Dude, this isn't looking for a girlfriend.  What is this?  He's looking to bang a chick in Texas.  So why don't they say that?  This is just looking to bed down.  Is this bedding down?  Be groovy.  A hip cat.  This is 75.  What's wrong with you?  You're a square, man.  So he's just trying to get some poof-pots.  He's trying to get some action.  All right.  That's why he's complimented.  But the way he complimented her hair out of nowhere.  This is in 75 when a condom was just uncircumcised.  He's just looking for action. 
[00:34:00]  He's using our shampoo commercials on television.  Really?  Yeah.  And this Texas sun is murder on most hair I've seen today, but yours is lovely.  Just lovely.  Wow.  Thank you.  Now Mike set her up. 
[00:34:30]  All girls want to be on television.  So Mike puts a real casual front on.  All right.  He's trying to just get some poof-pots.  Yeah, he's lying to her.  But he's so creepy.  Yeah, that hair.  That'd look great on your head on my mantle.  But that's what...  Here's what...  Women just want an excuse.  It's like, as long as it's not their fault that they went home with this guy or went to  the hotel with this guy, as long as they make her feel like...  Like he had the line and...  Yeah.  Like, it's not like, hey, look, I ain't... 
[00:35:00]  Look, I don't care about your hair because I'm trying to mess it up, really.  You know what I mean?  So it's like, look, why don't you come on back and do this?  She can't go, okay.  You have to make him feel like it's something else.  Yeah.  That's not that bad.  It's just that now women are a lot more savvy.  Yeah, a woman would pick up on this.  In a second, you would be blown off, probably arrested.  30 years later.  A woman who was born during this is 30 years old now.  Different time, different savviness.  You know, it's a different thing than that. 
[00:35:30]  But that's exactly the same...  Well, let's see how this ends.  And Mike plays it cool in this next clip.  I think this approach stinks.  He gives her just enough slack and then confesses that he's just an insurance salesman.  Are you kidding?  He fesses?  Let's see what happens.  Well, I don't want to hold you up.  I'm sure you're very busy.  Why don't you just tell me the name of your beauty parlor and I can go by there and see  if I can find someone there who's got some spare time.  I don't know.  I got some spare time.  Are you sure? 
[00:36:00]  Yes, I'm certain.  Oh, this is a real imposition.  You were going to lunch.  Now Mike is careful not to get too casual and lose her.  He gives her just enough slack and sets the hook.  No, I was just going shopping for a few things.  It can wait.  You know, I'd never be able to find such perfect hair for us in any beauty parlor anyway.  But I wash and set it myself.  You do?  Yes.  Well, can you spare a minute from your shopping? 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  Then why don't you give me all the details.  Let's duck in here for a drink for a minute.  Mike has completely disarmed her natural street defenses by complimenting her and then backing  off, pretending he's not so interested.  Not so interested.  Now that they're having a drink, let's see how he handles telling this luscious chick he's  really an insurance salesman without losing her.  You know, I've got something I should confess to you.  Why is he confessing?  I'm a bus driver. 
[00:37:00]  Ah, hello Bill.  Why is he confessing if he's just going for the puha?  I don't know.  It can't be a relationship thing he's going for.  The whole thing is based on a lot.  The first thing that he told her was a lie.  What's that?  Well, I really noticed your hair for personal reasons.  Yeah.  Oh.  You see, I'm just visiting Dallas on business and when I saw you, I thought to myself,  now she belongs in a television commercial.  She's so great looking.  If I were in advertising, I would have picked you from all the girls in Dallas to be in 
[00:37:30]  my shampoo commercial.  Really?  That's the truth.  Now Mike's told her the truth.  He didn't tell her the truth.  And he's still pretending he doesn't even notice the snowy cleavage she's showing him.  The snowy cleavage.  And you know she looks like one of the women standing around when Kennedy got shot.  Of course.  Big hair.  Big behind hair.  And she probably has a blue suit.  A Jackie O suit. 
[00:38:00]  Like the chicks from Animal House.  Like she looks just like one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Dean Wormer's wife.  And he's, oh really?  You still want to see my cucumber?  And are they going to, later on they're going to show the part where she throws some kind  of hot soup in his face for wasting her time?  By this time, the roofie he put in her drink should be taking effect.  This thing is pre-stalking laws.  No.  Hell yeah.  Pre-age.  This thing is pre-everything.  Pre-restraining orders.  Pre-restraining. 
[00:38:30]  Pre-everything.  Right.  This is where you can just go.  This is pretty much just after the point where hitting him on the head with a club and  dragging him home was acceptable.  That they said no to.  But everything else was a go.  This is the wild, wild west of picking up broads.  You want to see how it ends there?  Of course.  Of course you do.  Mike.  Let this liar get the action.  Mike gets a day for later tonight.  He should go all the way tonight.  Say, since I don't know a thing about Dallas, maybe you could suggest a club where they have  dinner and dancing. 
[00:39:00]  Well, there's the Potter Luck or there's Sir Williams Inn.  Send them to a gay bar and don't show up.  Sir Williams.  How'd you like to go there with me tonight?  I was supposed to go to the movies.  Oh, that's too bad.  This is my only night in town.  I was really hoping to step out and enjoy some real Texas hospitality.  Mike lets her know it's tonight or never.  I could go to the movies another night.  And tonight you can show me Sir Williams.  Terrific.  I'll meet you afterwards. 
[00:39:30]  All that innuendo.  And I'll show you my Prince Albert.  Listen.  Let's go somewhere and have some crispy balls.  Some delicious.  What an ass.  He really is an ass.  Oh.  Well.  Look at that fireman's helmet.  It is bulbous.  I wonder if there's a raging fire somewhere.  This gets her mind thinking about other things. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh.  What?  I've never heard so much innuendo.  I know.  It's the worst.  Some of this Texas hospitality.  Hospitality.  Do they serve bratwurst here somewhere?  Big fat bratwurst?  They should have had a bubble over his head that said wink, wink or a thought bubble.  I'm going to get some ass later.  Could you help me in this supermarket?  I need to know if these cantaloupes are fresh.  So I'm just going to stand here and squeeze them.  Oh, yeah.  Do these look good? 
[00:40:30]  Pickles are my favorite.  Could you just roll these kiwis around in your hand for a while and tell me if they're fresh?  That's good.  No, the only way you can really tell is if I lob a spoonful of yogurt in your face.  So since we're at the supermarket and you're fondling the kiwis, I'm just going to throw yogurt at your face while I see if these cantaloupes are fresh.  I know it might look odd, but could you lay that trout under my nose?  Because I really, I'm shopping here with you in Texas. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, God.  In your window is hilarious.  It's unbelievable.  That's out you window.  That isn't even close to in you window.  That is the most, there is no girl that would go for this in the past 50 years.  Well, let's see how it ends, okay?  And tonight you can show me Sir Williams.  Terrific.  I'll meet you afterward.  That's it.  From sidewalk to evening date. 
[00:41:30]  Mike played it beautifully once he settled down and shows his girl.  Because he picked a chick he really dug, his natural sincerity showed, and she instinctively trusted him.  He was able to keep cool and let her get excited.  Yeah.  With his style, he should go all the way tonight.  Should.  Okay.  I got something.  Well, I want to see how much times have changed.  We got the walkover, right?  Yeah.  One of these guys are doing that exact thing to a girl on the street during the walkover.  Get kicked in the...  I want to see how far he gets. 
[00:42:00]  Do the same thing.  Go, excuse me, who does your hair?  I want...  Run through it a couple...  Whoever's going to do it, listen to that a couple of times.  Get the basic gist.  I want to see how far you get on the walkover.  Because I think it's going to be...  First of all, every girl's going to pass by and not even stop.  If one stops, it's going to be what?  Like, and you're never going to get past the I'm in commercial part of the...  It just wouldn't work.  None of these guys are going to do it.  It's hard to meet anybody in the street, ever.  I don't know how many women I've ever met in the street. 
[00:42:30]  In the street.  No one meets in the street.  Very difficult.  All right.  Hold that thought.  We got a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Andre 3000, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Uh, the taint thing.  Ah, wow.  Well, Opie's, uh, there's no curse when it comes to, uh, Opie, uh, his ability to guess  a woman's age just by staring into her taint.  And if you're not familiar what a taint is, a taint the front door and a taint the back 
[00:43:00]  door, it's just right in between.  It's called the taint.  It's more, it's more than just a taint, though.  You got to kind of take that overall...  The whole area.  But ground zero there, the place you really look at is the taint.  It's a math equation.  All that.  Right.  There's, there's things you look at and you figure out the age.  And you've done this, uh, how many times now?  Uh, I am now four for four.  Four for four.  Four for four.  None in the loss column.  None even in the overtime loss column.  It's just, you are four for four. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  And, uh, we had the girl that was the expert on, uh, the back door thing.  On the, uh, A-sex.  The A-sex.  Tristan.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, she, uh, yeah, she bent over and we, we, we, uh, took a look.  Took a little gander and Opie, uh, guessed her age.  It's amazing.  So check this out.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Uh, I think that, uh, Opie, uh, I didn't hear how old she is.  I think Opie should, uh, pull out his old trick and, uh, see how old she is.  Oh, yes!  Oh, my God.  Yes!  Let me tell you something.  Opie's up for this one. 
[00:44:00]  Opie's amazing when it comes to this and he is a hundred percent on this.  I'm three for three.  He's three for three.  He can tell a woman's age, exact age, don't say it, by looking at her taint.  By looking at a girl's taint, he can tell the exact age of a girl.  Swear.  And I swear, he's three for three.  Last lady was fifty-two.  Yeah.  It stupefies me.  Would, would you be willing?  Okay.  It's amazing. 
[00:44:30]  Listener brought it up.  Okay.  She's, uh, back in position, Anthony.  All right.  You are, uh, looking at what you have to look for, uh, in order to get the proper, I don't  know what you even look for, but, wow, she's right.  It does snap right back.  I'm just looking.  Uh, very interesting.  Um, oh, do you have any?  Yeah, I'm going to have to tack on an extra year for that right there.  What?  Not that.  That.  Oh, that?  Okay.  It looks like a piece on lint.  I won't give it up.  Yeah, it does.  Okay.  I think I'm ready to guess. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  He's three for three.  We're hoping he keeps the streak alive.  I believe, ooh, I believe you had a, uh, a very special birthday recently.  What?  Right?  What is that?  Well, there's birthdays and then there's like those, you know, special birthdays.  Like what?  When you turn 18, when you turn 21, when you turn 30.  When you turn over?  What?  Are you saying she's 30?  Are you 30? 
[00:45:30]  I'm 30.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  The guy.  No effing way.  I don't even believe.  There is no way in the hell.  The guy has done that from a taint.  You knew this girl is 30 by looking at her.  Taint.  I can't explain it, but it happens every time.  It's a power like Superman has.  We are not here to understand it completely.  We are just here to accept it and thank God for it.  You're like Yoda. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  We'll do a whole break during the commercials and then we try to recreate on the air and  it's like, oh.  Well, we rarely try to recreate it on the air.  We know it just doesn't work that way.  It's like scripted or pre-thought out stuff.  So you guys start and then it's like, all right, hold it.  Hold it right there.  Let's just stop right there.  We were kind of talking about cars.  Bill is congratulating me.  The Mustang, that son of a bitch. 
[00:46:30]  Much to Jimmy's horror.  The fact that this idiot is doing 110 miles an hour, it just worries me.  Allegedly.  Yeah, allegedly.  Someone said, what do you have?  A lever that, like fighter planes release chaff to keep a missile off you.  It's like, do you have a lever that releases PBA cards that just fly out of the back of your  car when a cop gets behind you?  Every time a cop pulls out anywhere near behind me, I just expect to get pulled over now.  I haven't yet.  But even doing the speed limit and everything, I just expect it. 
[00:47:00]  Because my car looks so fast, man.  Because it's the kind of car you would get pulled over in.  That's just it.  Looks selfish.  I have a mortgage payment to make.  We can't afford to have your teeth in a tree.  How about this?  You know he ties a bandana around his head.  Of course, he plays young rock music.  Bandana!  Born to be one.  Are you?  All right.  He has to listen to Grand Funk Railroad.  We're an American band. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, man.  I picture more of Tom Cochran.  Life is a highway.  Once my mortgage is paid off.  Oh, he should hit a tree.  Life is a highway.  When I said I was picking the car up, I remember Jimmy saying, what are you going to blare out  of the stereo?  A Bon Jovi?  Like some kind of Bon Jovi song?  And I'm sitting in the showroom waiting for the paperwork to get done.  And a Bon Jovi song comes on in the showroom.  And I'm cracking up just thinking, you give love. 
[00:48:00]  You're going to get the wind in your head.  A bad name.  No, I don't.  Makes me sick.  No, he would listen to that, the cowboy.  I'm a cowboy.  What it did are our lives.  I'm like, yeah, this is my life.  I am a cowboy.  I'm a cowboy.  And this is my steel horse, man.  It's a Mustang.  But I'm in it, not on it.  You know, like the song says.  Because it's not a motorcycle. 
[00:48:30]  What is the ultimate driving tune?  Give us a call.  Shut up.  Shut up.  No one cares.  I keep the radio down very low because I have to hear the engine, man.  Hear him, my car.  I've got to hear it, man.  It's freaking Anthony.  I think, honestly, I think it's awesome.  He was telling me how fast he was going the other day.  And I'm not even thinking about our future together.  I'm just like, yeah, cool, man.  Yeah, all I'm thinking about is gig plugs.  How about this?  As soon as I, if I ever, like, make it, I'll hand you a bottle of liquor and you can drive 
[00:49:00]  as fast as you want.  And then I'll laugh at my friend as I visit you and I tickle your chin when you can't move  below the neck.  Can't do impersonations when you're blowing into a tube.  See, I probably should be the guy that says, you know what, Ant?  That's, you really shouldn't be doing that.  Bob would get mad at you.  Not Bob.  Bob's got the insurance policy out of me.  Yeah, he's got the life insurance policy on you.  Double indemnity for an accident, he'd probably get loads of cash.  He told me you were doing 110, he goes, f***.  Yeah, faster, faster.  When we signed our contract at NEW where we were going to get syndicated and we were going 
[00:49:30]  to make the big time finally, they actually sat me down and said, before you sign this,  could you promise that you wouldn't hold on to the back of trucks anymore when you're  skating around Manhattan?  Rollerblading, yeah.  Because I would tell the stories on the air.  Yeah, it'd be a great way to go a little faster and get home a little faster and have a little  adventure.  And they actually sat me down like, could you please not do that anymore?  Look.  We're investing in you guys now.  Here's all I did.  I try to be an adult when I'm driving.  I really do. 
[00:50:00]  It's on the Meadowbrook Parkway at like one in the afternoon.  There's no one on this thing.  There's really no one on the parkway, the stretch that I was on.  And this jackass comes up next to me with this, I don't know what it was, one of these  cars that the Hispanic people like driving, I think a Toyota Celica.  And he's stolen.  That's very good.  But like, and he kept like pushing it. 
[00:50:30]  You know, he kept just going mad.  I know.  And I don't look.  How old are you?  I know.  Exactly.  I don't fall for that.  So I'm just, no, he just kept coming up real fast and then, and then pulling a little  ahead of me and then pulling behind me again, just being like a douche.  Just, you know something, normally in my frigging Escalade, I would get away from him.  I just wanted away from him.  I like being around nobody when I'm driving, especially if the road's clear. 
[00:51:00]  I don't like someone next to me.  That's why you have guns.  So, yeah, exactly.  That's why you just pop a few out the window.  So, so I decided to just pull away from him and I put it to the floor and it, I swear  to you, it was just a matter of a few short seconds and it was up to 110 miles an hour.  And he was like, not even an issue anymore as far as being next to me.  Anthony, how dumb are you?  It was, what?  You're just admitting to the entire tri-state area that you're up for the challenge. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, I'm up.  I'm up for it.  You see me out there.  Come on.  On that dangerous street called the Meadowbrook Parkway.  The Meadowbrook Parkway.  It's wonderful.  Pink street signs.  Ah, yeah.  Believe me, there's plenty of crosses and roses taped to trees on that road.  Leave your monuments at home, you morbid bastards.  When I was in L.A., on the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica, where they met, there was 
[00:52:00]  all these flowers.  Oh, boy.  And somebody had a bicycle that they had spray painted the whole thing white.  I guess somebody got killed on a bicycle.  Dude, there's one in Brooklyn, too.  On a bicycle.  Oh, my God.  There's one in Brooklyn, a bike.  It's chained to a sign.  It's spray painted white for a girl I got hit by a truck.  Yeah.  Why don't you just put the corpse out there?  Yeah.  Yeah, at least we can touch it.  Just lay it.  I literally got like, it was like seeing a ghost.  Yeah, why do we have to be depressed because you lost a loved one?  They're all over the place, those crosses.  Be reminded of your own mortality. 
[00:52:30]  Be reminded that driving is dangerous.  Be reminded that this tree isn't moving.  Like, it's the tree with a big friggin' Tyrannosaurus bite mark taken out of it, and then a little cross  with flowers, and we miss you.  With a baby picture.  Oh, great.  A baby, too.  Wonderful.  It's going to be like a frosted, like, crushed tricycle with a little ball.  Little baby shoes dangling from a branch.  Do we have to, the exact spot of your desk have to mark it?  It's so depressing.  Yeah, you're not John F. Kennedy.  Let's calm down. 
[00:53:00]  You're not JFK.  Right.  Why don't they just spray paint your cubicle and show what you really accomplished in life?  Maybe you hit the tree on purpose.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, then at least you can go, all right, I see why he did this.  Yeah.  Okay.  Right.  You just don't need that.  If you do that, you know how many guys in Chelsea would have, like, little crucifixes  hanging around their asses?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  This got evil real quick.  It certainly did.  Yeah, wow.  We were supposed to be talking about Pimp My Ride. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, let's do that.  Yeah, so...  Well, I was talking, saying how, you know, his car looks great.  You know what I mean?  It's got, like, one little stripe on it, you know, just enough.  But, like, Pimp My Ride, they somehow, they jumped the shark, man.  They used to make decent cars, but now they have to, like, top each other.  Yeah, it's people take their piece of crap car, and they win the opportunity to have their  ride pimped.  And I remember when the show first came on, it was just, hey, fix it.  I got a piece of crap.  It's rusted.  It's dented.  They put some rims on it.  Yeah, they put some nice rims on it.  They'll tint the windows or something like that. 
[00:54:00]  Whatever it is.  It's just something.  And then give it a, take all the dents out and give it a good paint job.  And now they show you, and it's like, oh.  And they ask you what your interests are, so they could incorporate some of your interests  into the vehicle.  That's what screwed it up.  That's what screwed the whole thing up.  And the new guy, the new Mexican guy, they got spray painting in.  Yeah.  Picks the worst colors.  Like, you'll have, like, the greatest car ever.  It's like a Ferrari.  And he goes, oh, I'm going to take some lime green and some lavender.  And I saw that you had an aquarium, so I'm going to put fish scales down the side with 
[00:54:30]  some gills.  And they start nodding at the camera.  It's like, why are you going to do that?  What are you doing?  Not only that, though.  They would put the actual fish tank in the car, too.  Exactly.  Make it to where you can't even drive the thing anymore.  What are you saying?  We put a chandelier in the back seat because we heard you like Titanic.  You like the movie.  So anytime.  And then we put a DVD player in the headrest.  They ruin these things where the doors don't even open anymore. 
[00:55:00]  Like, they fold out on motors and turn into, like, wings.  Because I hear, you know, you like airplanes.  Oh, really?  And they make the cars Atari for carjacking.  It's like, because most of these cars are in the bad neighborhoods.  And it's the huge sound system they put.  Yeah, now you have to drive around with this thing, then.  They all saw it on MTV.  You've got a flat tire.  How are you going to get away?  You're just going to call the cops.  Yeah, it's got fish scales on it.  Yeah.  And it's hot pink and burnt sienna.  It's got plain wings and 14 Dominicans in it.  You'll see it.  And it's got a basketball hoop, you know, on my hood because I like basketball. 
[00:55:30]  So they decided to get a hoop.  Yeah, put a hoop on there so you could shoot hoops.  What the heck?  They've got a kicker system where there's no spare tire anymore.  The whole trunk is taken up with some kind of sound system that's going to blow the windshield out.  I saw one.  This girl was an artist.  So they got some sort of computer screen that you literally can draw on.  And they put it above her in the car.  That's what you need.  On the driver's side.  Because that's what she's going to do at Red Light if she gets, like, inspired.  And I'm sure, in case, you know, you get into an accident, everything is real safe. 
[00:56:00]  The shrapnel from 20 flat screen televisions exploding in your face.  20 flat screens and an easel.  Yeah.  We took out the airbag and put in a flat screen.  So if you get in an accident, you get to see the accident happen before the flat screen hits you in the face.  It just stinks now.  Just fix it.  And they're trying to be funny. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  And they're not.  Oh, it's awful.  It's really bad.  Well, I've got a lot of people that want to race you now on the Meadowbrook.  Yeah.  See what you started?  Mm-hmm.  They're all mad that I'll beat them.  I'll race you on Fanny Pack Lane.  All right.  What do you got?  What do you got, George?  All right.  Listen.  Yeah.  Anthony, you there?  Yeah.  What do you got?  All right.  Listen, man.  I got a 72 Roadrunner.  You bring your gold card.  I'll wait for you on the Meadowbrook.  I'll show you who's boss.  We'll race for pinks.  We'll race for pinks.  We'll race for pinks. 
[00:57:00]  Wait, wait.  You got to race for.  What do you got?  I got a 72 Roadrunner.  Oh, stop it.  He's got the real one.  I'm a Mopal, man.  Dude.  I'll eat your car up in a heartbeat.  Just stop it.  You got rims on your gold card?  What's your quarter time, my friend?  I do nines.  You do what?  Tens?  Elevens?  All right.  I do 12, so shut up.  Opie and Jimmy.  Opie and Jimmy.  How much time have you spent under the hood, my friend? 
[00:57:30]  Opie and Jimmy.  Hey, can I be third, Mike?  How much time have you spent under the hood?  Of course you can.  I'll be third, Mike.  He moves up.  I've been going to school for like five years, bro.  Of course.  I don't want to.  Take your greasy fingers and go home.  The OJ virus spreading across America.  OJ.  OJ?  Oh, nothing.  You keep talking about racing.  No, no.  We're not planning.  This isn't plotting.  This is planning.  Yes, thank you, Jimmy.  Hey, are we going to spray paint his car all white and put like a headset hanging, headphones  hanging off it? 
[00:58:00]  I'm not going to tell you, my friend.  You'll beat me.  They should pimp your eye with Nazi stuff, man.  Nazi memorabilia.  Actually, I have two out of the three colors.  Oh, that Mexican dude.  And I heard that you don't like me.  I got a big swastika painted right on my hood.  I'll look for you.  All right.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, they had an episode where they put TV screens in the headlights.  They what?  Like TV sets in the headlights?  They put me outside to see.  They put TV screens in the headlights? 
[00:58:30]  Does that make any sense?  No, it doesn't.  I know.  I'm punching out, boys.  All right.  Let's go to Don from Pittsburgh.  Don.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Don's a guy?  Don.  Is your name Don?  Don.  D-O-N, yeah.  Don.  Wow, that Pittsburgh accent is a bitch.  For you, anyway.  Don.  Our androgynous little phone answerer.  I couldn't tell.  What's up, Dwan?  Hey, that whole comment you guys made about those crosses and stuff on the side of the road? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  You know what?  I totally agree with you.  If your parents die in your bed, you don't make a monument in there, do you?  Yes.  Then why do it on the side of the road?  I don't get the roadside memorials.  Someone on the instant feedback, I can't find it now, they're like, and mostly these  people really care.  You actually will take the time to maybe look at one of these because you're whatever, I  don't know, changing a tire or why you would be on the side of the road.  Limp along on a flat pass, I think.  Right.  Creepy.  And all of a sudden you see the pictures and you can barely see the pictures anymore because 
[00:59:30]  the sun has taken...  They're all faded.  Yeah.  They're all faded.  And then this person's like, yeah, you really care enough to come by every six months and  maybe change the picture.  Re-up it.  It's not a cemetery.  Stupid teddy bears with a pink ribbon.  Oh, you just know it was awful.  But it wasn't a kid.  It was just a retarded adult.  He shouldn't have been driving.  Hey, Danny in Boston.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, I got a cruising song for you.  Yeah?  Highway Star by Deep Purple.  Oh, Highway Star by Deep Purple.  No, he's from Boston. 
[01:00:00]  Highway Star.  Highway Star.  Highway Star.  Well, call your local home of rock and roll.  That's who would care about that.  That's what I'm jamming.  Best cruising song is of Tempted by the Fruit of Another.  Oh, my God.  That could be the worst one.  You picked the worst one.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Detroit Rock City.  Yes, we get it.  We're not doing this bit, though.  Karen, Edison, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Have you ever seen Trick My Truck on CMT?  I've heard about that.  Is that country? 
[01:00:30]  On country music television?  Of course it is.  Oh, it was Bert from Philly wants to credit on that.  What do they do with the trucks?  What do they do, putting nooses in the back of them?  No.  They take people with hardship stories and fix their tracks for trailers.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Yeah, I think they go to literally the trailer trash.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, you know, my husband beats me.  Well.  And then I want to drive away from it, but the truck won't start, and then he beats me  with the fender. 
[01:01:00]  That's fantastic.  Who hosts that one?  Is it like Travis Tritt?  It's the Chrome Mafia.  What?  The Chrome Shop Mafia is the name of the people who do it.  Yeah, the whole name, and that wasn't it.  Way to know when someone's going for a line.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Joelle.  Joelle.  Sometimes you'll ask a question.  Let me explain to the audience what Bill is doing, and this is what we do.  You have a joke you want to say, and sometimes you'll ask, like, what am I supposed to do?  And then comes the line.  Yeah.  But as he says that, she jumps in with her literal answer. 
[01:01:30]  I mean, what are they going to call it?  Chrome Mafia.  All right.  Well, there goes that moment.  Thanks a lot, stupid.  For ruining that.  Thanks a lot.  Joelle.  Perhaps it's the Chrome Mafia.  That's good, Jimmy.  Joelle.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  What do you got for the show?  Hey, I just wanted to defend Jersey.  I know it's been a while since you guys were talking about the Jersey-Cleveland crap,  but from a girl who went to school in Ohio right by Cleveland, it sucks. 
[01:02:00]  Wow.  See, it's starting it.  Wow, Jersey is mocking Cleveland bad.  A city is, a state is fighting a city.  That's not good.  Yeah.  That's not good.  I'm saying Jersey versus Cleveland.  It's not a city, though.  Cleveland is not a city?  It's a cesspool.  It's got four buildings.  It's got four buildings, and the rest is all neighborhoods.  And that's it.  But you guys rock.  Thanks for being back. 
[01:02:30]  Godspeed.  Thank you.  Bye.  She told them over there in Cleveland.  I'm talking gal like that.  She told them.  Thank God she's on our side.  Craig on Long Island.  Craig.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I was working over the weekend on Sunday out in the Rockaways.  I'm driving on, who's that, Ocean Shorefront Parkway, whatever the hell it is.  And, you know, looking at the water, girls, and there's one of those bikes.  All spray-painted white.  What?  I'm going to do a tray or something. 
[01:03:00]  I'm telling you, the hair on the back of my head, the back of my neck stood up.  I had never heard of the bike thing, the white bike thing.  It's like, it was like one of those little girly bikes.  But they spray-painted white because, I guess, the kid's in heaven now?  Completely white.  And then they'll be all underneath it.  Only allow white bicycles and people in heaven.  I'm just like, I don't need to see this.  All right.  It's like heaven's going to be a great place.  Oh, come on.  Oh, sorry.  I want to steal one of those bikes and then just ride it around.  Ride around that stupid ghost bike.  Oh, that'd be great for Halloween. 
[01:03:30]  Steal one of those bikes.  There's Jimmy riding the all-white bike and it says, we miss you, Ashley, on the back.  I'm making these ghost noises.  Driving by our house.  Oh, what a creep.  Dude, you should steal one of the bike and then you dress up as the guy who got run over.  Either that or you just chain your bike to it on the side and then run it to the store.  This memorial now has like your kickstand scratching it.  Bicycle rack.  Put a bike rack there.  God, I want to steal that bike so bad. 
[01:04:00]  And then just ride it.  Going boo.  Just ride it in circles going ha-ha.  Let's go to Doug out, Doug.  Doug, what do you got?  You guys trampled a great line by Jimmy before when talking about Anthony's Pimp My Ride.  You guys were throwing out Nazi references and Jimmy just simply said, a really big ashtray.  Thank you.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  Hey, let's go to Samantha in West Palm.  Sometimes you don't want them to remind the people what you said. 
[01:04:30]  Samantha, what's up?  Nothing.  I was just calling to make a comment about, you know, the roadside memorabilia.  You're a sexy voice.  Thank you.  I think that it's a good thing.  I think that it's a reminder to people who are out there driving, maybe driving drunk,  making stupid decisions, driving fast, that this is what can happen.  And it doesn't only affect those people.  It affects other people.  No, you're wrong.  You're wrong.  No, it doesn't affect the family. 
[01:05:00]  It's creepy.  Once you're dead, you're dead.  The family gets over it.  Thank you.  I would love to know how many crashes were caused because someone was looking at the roadside  memorial going, what the?  Wait, what, Samantha?  What did you ask?  I'm sorry.  I said, well, you really love your family then, don't you?  Because I know if my family member was deceased because of a drunk driver, I don't think I  would be too happy about that.  I don't mind.  But would you build a...  Yeah, would you spray paint something white and make everybody else look at it?  Spray paint a bunch of whiskey bottles and put it there. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, spray paint a bar with laughing patrons.  Shut up and let us laugh.  We're having a laugh, Sammy.  Hold on a second.  Sammy?  Hold on a second.  Sammy with an I and a little heart dotting it.  We're having a good chuckle over the drunk driving death thought.  Memorial.  Memorial.  Bill, now get back to your point.  What were you saying?  I was just saying that I think it's a good thing in a way.  We know you do.  A little white thing spray painted all over.  Shut up.  I've seen a white bike spray painted, so I mean, I can't say anything. 
[01:06:00]  But yet you're commenting.  But yet you're...  Good point, Bill.  Good point.  All right.  Who would you lose in your family, Samantha?  Huh?  Who got hit?  Who would you lose?  I did, but I've lost six friends in drunk driving accidents.  That's a lot of spray.  Jesus.  Yeah, in a three-year period of time.  And...  Were they the drunk ones?  In one case, the three of them were driving and the one kid was drunk, but in the other  case, it was a drunk driver who hit my friend's car and flipped them, and they all three of 
[01:06:30]  them died.  Yeah.  So you've got three families that lost a member of their family because of somebody else's  irresponsibility.  Does anybody remember last year?  You know what?  Does anybody remember last year?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  ...on the side of the road.  What?  I just don't think that there's anything wrong with putting a cross up on the side of the  No, I know you don't, but you know what, Sammy Kings, let me take lemons and make lemonade  here.  I mean, I know it's really sad for the families and stuff like that, but that extra money  at Christmas can be put towards other things.  Right. 
[01:07:00]  Just because they're deceased doesn't mean that they were never your family.  Oh, I was kidding.  You still have to have the same respect.  Oh, my God.  Way to just bum out everybody.  You ought to take your funny bone and spray paint it white and put it somewhere.  God Almighty, you're a humorless hole.  Shut up.  I think we're going to reconsider our trip to West Palm.  Oh, my God.  What a curmudgeon.  How long have you been listening to the show?  I think she...  She...  I see...  Not very long because some of the points that you guys make are...  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  Well, how old the point are you?  This is what I'm going to tell you.  I don't think the show's for you.  Got to tell you.  We don't need every listener out there.  If we keep her on the phone any longer, we're going to have to spray paint the show white.  Yeah.  So, what you ought to do is, listen, we understand you've had some bereavement.  So, why don't you...  If you miss your friend so much, why don't you grab a bottle, drive real fast.  You'll see him soon enough.  Call me with that self-righteous dreck.  Shut up.  They're saying certain states want to ban roadside memorials.  Good.  I say good as well.  Absolutely. 
[01:08:00]  And funerals.  And everything.  Once you're dead, they put you in a big fire.  And you're not even allowed to cry.  Yeah, they just toss you in a wood chipper.  They just throw you in a wood chipper.  It's a thing we call a virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Patrice O'Neill in studio today. 
[01:08:30]  Right.  We were just talking about...  Steaks on a plane.  Steaks on a plane.  Stop that hissing.  It's a snake on a plane.  Snake on a plane.  We were saying they should just substitute all of his Pulp Fiction lines and just put them  in the movie.  Hmm.  Seems like that's what happened.  That's some tasty oatmeal.  Snake?  You read the Bible, Snake?  This is some repugnant mother effing...  Stop that hissing. 
[01:09:00]  What are we going to do about the snake?  How are they going to pull this off like you guys are saying during the break?  How is this movie going to be pulled off?  I just want to know.  It's got so much hype and everyone's like goofing on it before it comes out and talking about it.  I've been hearing about snakes on a plane since, what, like Thanksgiving?  Oh man, it's been months.  It's been a really long time.  They've been hyping this movie for almost a year.  Nine months.  Definitely, as per E-Rock, they had to rewrite the film a lot because during, I guess, some  of the quick screenings they've given people, they didn't like the fact that Sam Jackson 
[01:09:30]  didn't use the MRF-er enough, which is one of his, you know, everyone loves hearing him  use that phrase.  He's still in his Jedi mode.  It wasn't cursing enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's still in his...  Ace Windu.  The force.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, my children.  Ace Windu, whatever the hell his name was.  But they, yeah, they wanted him cursing more.  And more snakes, I guess.  There weren't enough...  Not enough snakes on the plane! 
[01:10:00]  You need a lot of snakes on the plane.  It's just one snake?  That sucks.  And how did he get on the plane with the snakes?  I don't know!  But I'm on a plane!  But I'm on a plane full of snakes!  They must not be liquid!  Snakes!  Snakes ain't liquid!  People are saying the movie's good, man.  And RottenTomatoes.com is giving it 77% good rating.  What does that mean?  Rotten Tomatoes is the best website for movie reviews, because they take all the reviews 
[01:10:30]  from all the papers all over America, and then they give you a nice average.  Because your local guy might just be...  There's Rotten Tomatoes on the motherf***ing plane!  Because your local movie reviewer could just be a douche.  Yeah.  You know, so you get the balance of the entire country, and then you can figure out a little  better if the movie's going to be alright.  I think they must have genius...  They must have geniusly pimped, because it's almost like when somebody attacks you, you  attack yourself to give it less fire.  Yeah.  So I think they're making this movie purposely trying to say, oh, this is goofy and it's 
[01:11:00]  awful, and they're like, okay, we're going to review it as a goofy, awful movie.  And for a goofy, awful movie, it's not bad.  This is fantastic.  Did you ever see a sign on the plane that said, live snake storage, Jules?  Hey, uh...  Whoopies on the plane!  I thought it was snakes, but it was a hair!  Whoopies, motherf***er, hairs on the plane!  I thought we had snakes on a plane! 
[01:11:30]  It's scaring the passengers!  It's just Whoopies hair!  It's Whoopies dreadlocks on a motherf***er plane!  Damn, now we don't have a movie!  Hey, that snake bitch, are you okay?  Nah, I'm...  Nah, man.  I'm far from...  I'm pretty f***ing far from okay.  Wake up, Whoopies!  Oh, yeah.  Let me get some hard pipe-hitting s*** over here.  Work on Whoopie Goldberg with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch. 
[01:12:00]  They're gonna get medieval on your ass.  Negro, that's all you had to say!  Yeah, Marsalis, there's snakes on a plane!  Snakes on a motherf***er plane.  What are they gonna think up next in Hollywood?  Snakes on a plane. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, Kyle in New York.  I love it.  Kyle?  Hey, man.  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  You saw Snakes on a Plane last night, right?  Yes, it was the best movie of the summer.  Wow.  Wow, look.  The summer didn't have a lot to choose from.  How about birds in a car?  There's a bird!  Screw bird, how about a bee in your car?  Now, that's frightening.  There's a bee in the car! 
[01:13:00]  God damn!  I got to get these pack heats to the pack heat asylums for pack heats!  Without getting eaten by the snakes!  Oh, damn.  There's otters in a canoe!  Holy moly!  They got big teeth! 
[01:13:30]  Hit them with a horn, dummy!  Oh, my God!  I can't get past bees in a car, though.  Because that's frightening, man.  When you're driving and you just hear...  Yeah, look, I'll be making a fly.  Please be a fly.  It's a bee!  No!  It's not just weaving all over the road.  Damn bee in a car!  Bee in a car!  Bee in a car!  I ain't getting a scar stung by no mother...  bee in no mother...  car! 
[01:14:00]  This summer.  Bees in a car.  Well, that's how Hollywood works, so you know these are coming.  If there's any success with snakes on a plane...  They'll just throw something in some form of transportation.  Fish in the post office!  I'm driving a mask, son!  And there's fish in the post office!  Sharks.  Sharks in the post office.  Sharks in the post office.  I got to mail a mother...  letter...  and there's mother...  fish in the mother... 
[01:14:30]  post office!  Hey, shark, lick this stamp!  If you're gonna kill me, let me mail my bills!  Hey, Mr. Torres is calling out Patrice O'Neal from the Overlook, of course.  Why do parakeets need to go to an asylum?  I don't know!  I was trying to...  Are these evil parakeets?  They're evil parakeets, man!  Evil!  Thank you for helping me through that...  Friendly parakeets?  They're crazy.  Man, this is Hollywood, man! 
[01:15:00]  Hiss again!  Come on, hiss again!  I dare ya!  I double dare ya, mother-effer!  It's one more goddamn time!  Rob from Jacksonville.  It's one more time!  I dare ya!  I double dare ya!  Oh!  Yeah, here we go, here we go.  Let's go to Mike in Boston.  Mike, what's up?  Say snakes again!  Say snakes again!  Say snakes one more goddamn time!  I double dare ya, mother-effer! 
[01:15:30]  Say snakes one more time!  Hold on, hold on!  There's mother-f***ing possums at the bank!  I gotta get in the bank!  There's possums in the bank!  How am I supposed to make a deposit with a possum in the mother-f***ing bank? 
[01:16:00]  I mean, s*** gotta eat!  And they ain't even trying to pretend to be asleep!  What kind of possum are these?  They ain't playing possum!  Stay up!  Bring them to the possum asylum!  Oh!  Oh my God!  Possums in the bank!  And they nuts!  And these possums ain't sleeping!  Wallabies at the DMZ! 
[01:16:30]  Possums in a bank!  Oh!  Oh!  Gerbils at the liquor store!  Oh, no!  Motherf***er!  I ain't gonna get some liquor!  What?  Gerbils in the liquor store!  How do you know at the end it's gonna be...  What do you think the saying is gonna be at the end?  Like, you know, the ending of the snake saying...  Oh, God. 
[01:17:00]  Hasta la vista, snakes!  Yeah, there's gotta be that one line.  That one douche line.  Like, uh, yeah, open and say, ah.  Right.  Or smile, you son of a bitch, from Jaws.  There's gotta be, like, the last snake.  And then a line.  Hey, we got a good one coming in.  John in Brooklyn.  Go ahead, John.  The sequel to Snakes on the Plane next year's summer blockbuster.

[01:23:00]  All right.  All right.  Let's, uh...  Let's go with...  Are you freaking?  Yeah, he is, Amy.  I'm pretty stoned.  Are you ready?  Oh, my God.  Amy, I...  How's that?  Come on, Amy.  Pull it together.  All right.  Propaganda.  That's what I was looking at.  What?  Propaganda.  Prop...  What?  Propaganda.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  P-R-O-P... 
[01:23:30]  Prop...  A-G...  Propaganda.  Oh.  P-R-O-P...  Propaganda.  A-G...  Oh, man.  I learned it from you.  A-N-D... 
[01:24:00]  Propaganda.  Okay.  Is it P-A-G or P-O-G?  You...  What?  What?  Propaganda.  You got to tell me.  Hold on, hold on.  You're just one letter away.  You're one letter away.  Spell propaganda.  Last chance.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Go.  P-R-O...  Prop...  This goes down to the classic.  It's a girl.  P-O-T-A-N... 
[01:24:30]  Propaganda...  No.  Okay.  P-R-O-P...  P-O-T-A-N-D... 
[01:25:00]  P-O-T-A-N-D...  P-O-T-A-N-D...  Oh!  Wow!  I did it?  You did it, Amy.  That was like a school.  I'm sweating.  End of the movie.  Here comes the play to play the bad news bears.  Part two. 
[01:25:30]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  All right.  Ding!  All right, Amy.  We're going to put you on hold.  You're still in the contest.  All right.  It's going to be long.  I'm really sleepy.  And so are we after that.  Hey, this is Brian Regan, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I was in beautiful tuxedo New York at the Renaissance Festival.  The New York Renaissance Festival. 
[01:26:00]  What is that?  That's where people go, and a lot of people are dressed up in Renaissance attire and talking  like they did in the olden days, and you buy, you know, a yard of mead, and you can get  a big turkey leg to eat if you want, and there are wenches walking around with their bosoms  pushed up in corsets.  Did you, or did you not dress up?  I absolutely did not dress up. 
[01:26:30]  You have dressed up in past years, haven't you?  I never went to the Renaissance Festival and dressed up.  I just don't do it.  So you're not a LARPer?  No.  I've dressed for Halloween as like a Renaissance guy.  But that was just a goof.  But it's Halloween, so you've got an excuse.  It was just a goof, right?  It's Halloween.  So you weren't walking around the Renaissance Festival like a LARPer?  No.  You weren't LARPing?  No, they have the people that work there that dress up. 
[01:27:00]  What do black people do during this awful time?  Well, let me tell you something.  I was hanging out, me, my girlfriend, a couple of her girlfriends, and one of the girlfriend's  boyfriends, Gus.  Very cool guy.  The guy kind of gives me somebody to talk to while the girls are, you know, going blind  because they all bought, like, costumes and stuff and dressed up.  So they dressed up?  The girls dress up.  Yeah.  And they walk around.  And then we walk around.  The girls are dressed up.  And, you know, they've got little shops.  And you buy little things. 
[01:27:30]  And you watch, you know, things go on.  They've got the jousts and sword fights and things going on like that.  And so me and Gus pretty much just goof on everything that's going on there.  And he goes, you notice something?  Like, what?  He goes, well, you know, lack of something.  Like, oh, okay.  Black people.  Isn't the future great?  They don't.  The future.  Oh, excuse me.  Wrong joke.  They, apparently, black people, not very interested in the Renaissance Festival. 
[01:28:00]  Why would they?  I know.  And Gus brought up a good point.  It's like anything before the Emancipation Proclamation is nothing but pain and slavery and conquering.  So I don't think they like being involved with that kind of thing.  A lot of white people.  A lot of bikers, for some reason, are into it.  A lot of geeks are into it.  So, you know, you get people that like sci-fi that are into it. 
[01:28:30]  And, I don't know, you just walk around.  It's entertaining.  I took a lot of pictures.  But all the pictures I took are of most of them anyway.  They sell these huge sausages on a stick.  And they're just giant.  I swear they have to be a foot long and as thick as if you made a fist.  And all I was doing was taking pictures of girls biting into these things and guys alike.  Do you have these pictures for the website? 
[01:29:00]  Those and the chocolate-covered bananas.  Yeah, I got a few.  Those and the chocolate-covered bananas.  We followed some guy around for, I don't know how long,  until he actually took a bite and got a big picture of him putting his mouth over this thing.  And then feeding it to another guy.  It was fantastic.  And these big, fat women.  We got this one.  She had just bought it at the stand.  Yeah.  And her eyes are open so wide and her mouth is open wide and she's shoving this big sausage in her mouth. 
[01:29:30]  You got to make your entertainment where you can.  Where was this?  How far from New York?  It's about an hour or so drive in the tuxedo New York.  Someone from their cell phone renaissance festival where people go to be medieval faggots.  Oh, there are some people go all out.  I mean, like, almost full suits of armor.  And then there's the guys that want to be, like, wear tights and, like, Shakespearean-type outfits. 
[01:30:00]  And it's just nothing.  But it looks like they're trying to steal a pumpkin from the Lord down the front of their tights.  It's like, could you put on a kilt or something?  Could you cover that up?  There's no reason to walk around like that.  There's no reason to walk around at all up there.  Well, it's a renaissance festival.  There's a fine reason to walk through the renaissance festival.  Here, take this, ye.  Well, there is a little fun to be had after you've had a few yards of ale. 
[01:30:30]  What you do is you go over by the archery, which is they give you, like, 25 arrows for a few bucks and a bow.  And you shoot into hay bales.  Are you trying to make this sound cool?  No, no.  Jimmy, are you listening to this?  Yeah.  You're trying to make this sound cool.  It's like, well, after a few yards, meaning I'm hammered now.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me tell you how cool it is.  You catch a little buzz. 
[01:31:00]  You grab your arrows and your bow.  Oh, you get to shoot arrows into hay.  See, but you don't shoot it into the hay.  See, me and Gus were shooting it over the top of the backdrop into the woods where we heard things and traffic.  So I'm not sure if maybe we've injured somebody or trying to hit the wooden boundary railing that you're not supposed to be aiming for.  Yeah.  And I said we'd make the news if we all just turned around and shot one person in the chest with the arrows. 
[01:31:30]  That would kind of, you know, eventually that's going to happen and then it's going to be no more arrows.  No more arrows.  Then this hatchet throwing at targets, you know, you pick up your hatchet and you give it a good throw.  So, and I got to purchase a brand new rapier.  So I have a new one to add to my rapier collection.  When you swing that, are you a rapiest?  No, rapiest.  Yes, that's what they call me.  Those will be proudly displayed in my office.  I just think it's funny you got stuck with a guy named Gus. 
[01:32:00]  Gus is a good egg.  I'm sure he's fantastic, but did you have to go, hey, Gus, check this out.  Gus.  Change your name.  Gusto.  He looks like Himmler.  He's German and looks like Himmler.  So it's kind of fun to hang around with him.  He knows a lot about German history.  Fun guy.  I remind you this morning that we are shock jocks.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  He's just shocking.  A lot of friends, though, I got to say, I have never been, look, see, here we go. 
[01:32:30]  I've never been to an event aside from an O&A event where I've seen and had more O&A fans come up to me and recognize me from the show and love the show than at the Renaissance Fair.  We must be failing pretty badly.  I don't have to pay for anything.  People come up.  I go, you know, give me like a beer or something.  Just get it.  Just get it for free.  They're great.  But I hear they were stepping out of character and stuff. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, that kind of ruins it a little bit.  Yeah, see, it ruins it for Anthony.  It ruins the experience.  He really wants everyone in character around him.  I'm in line.  And, you know, the guy behind the bar is like, you know, to the guy in front of me, is like,  Ah, my lord, would you, would thou like a yard of mead?  Would you like some mead, sir, some honey mead?  Ah, yes.  Anything for the lady, sir?  All right.  You know, so I go up there and it's like, dude, Anthony, love the show. 
[01:33:30]  Dude, have a bud.  You know, you guys were doing that bit the other day.  It's, what happened to the accent?  Where's the character?  I want the guy, the hello, my lord.  Well, they also want the guy.  Yeah.  That they think they know from the radio show.  So you both lost.  You both lost on that one.  They're expecting impersonations and fun.  And shuckery.  And instead they get, ugh.  Hey, they were there, too. 
[01:34:00]  They were working.  They all enjoy it.  Even the people working there.  I see it like a big carny gypsy thing where I picture at night, they're all just having  sex with each other and drinking the leftover mead.  They're like gypsies from the 1700s or something.  Why do they call it mead?  I don't know.  It's different from beer, mead.  I was just drinking, you know, bud.  So it's a beer product?  Yeah, I think it is.  It's some kind of weird beer-wine mix thing. 
[01:34:30]  I don't know.  But they have wine.  And in past years, they had really kind of adhered to the whole medieval thing.  But I'm starting to notice they're changing a few things.  Like you used to get, you know, the turkey leg was pretty much all you could get or some  other things.  A bowl made out of some baked bread with some gruel in it, like some soup or something.  And now you look up and there's Ye Tony's Pizza.  You know, it kind of takes away from the whole thing. 
[01:35:00]  And as people dressed up, you know, I think I saw a Klingon.  It's like, could you leave the sci-fi, you know, expo garb out of the Renaissance things?  Keep it, you know, in the right era.  You know, you're right.  When I go LARPing.  I wasn't LARPing.  I was at a Renaissance festival.  One of the biggest.  I want everyone to be LARPing in the same era.  When you go up there, are ye in a town that has just kind of decided to transform itself?  Well, the whole town is very small. 
[01:35:30]  It's a very small town.  So everywhere you go, there are people in Renaissance attire getting ready to go to the  big Renaissance fair, which is held at the same location.  And they have little shows that they put on.  And there's like an acrobat guy and other medieval type entertainment events.  Why don't they let it go?  It's been a long time since the medieval.  People seem to enjoy that time and dressing up and acting like that for some reason.  It's silly.  There's no medical knowledge. 
[01:36:00]  It was just an awful time.  Well, that's what I said.  They should have done that.  Like, you know, they lop someone's head off and then have some guy come over and just  put a few leeches on it, something like the real old school medicine.  But people just seem to enjoy that, that whole era and the attire and acting like that.  I don't know why.  There's some English people there and thought it would be weird for them to see a bunch of  Americans acting like, you know, their old culture.  Yeah.  I thought it would be weird if maybe in England they have some kind of a thing where they 
[01:36:30]  auction off people and do things like we did here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Michael Shiklis.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, let's go to the phone and say hi to Hunter and Wayne.  Hunter, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Anthony, if you actually said that you, if you're admitting on the air that you went to  a renaissance fair.  Yes.  Basically, at this point, to quote Tony Soprano, he's a f***er. 
[01:37:00]  Why would that be?  I go just about every year.  Okay.  It's fun to go with friends.  You have fun and you get to, and I'm not saying I don't have a good time there, but you do  get to make fun of a lot of people that are there.  Yeah.  Opie, when you went pumpkin picking, you may just make Opie's pumpkin picking look cool.  He went with his girlfriend.  And Gus.  And Gus.  Yeah.  Meaning his girlfriend was his beard. 
[01:37:30]  Because Gus was there.  Gus was his real date.  Gus was his real date.  Gus was not my date.  We got to commiserate a bit.  Gus.  What was it?  Gus and Elmer?  Were you Elmer for the day?  No, I was not Elmer.  Was that the name of those?  The old couple?  The old gay guys?  Was it Gus and Elmer?  It was Gus and Elmer.  Did Gus buy a sausage and then smack your face with it?  He didn't buy it.  Hey, this isn't sausage.  Anybody remember me cool was at the beach yesterday, like Opie. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, wow, man.  All right, man.  Yeah.  Real cool.  Where were you, Hunter?  I was at Sandy Hook yesterday.  Doing what?  Just getting myself a nice tan.  Yeah.  Nice, man.  I hope you get skin cancer.  It was one of the last nice beach days of the year.  Oh, there's a stupid beach around here.  Thank you, bro.  Thank you.  That's Hunter.  Green water.  You can't see your belly button through the water.  Oh, you don't know anything.  Oh, I know everything about the goddamn beach.  You don't know where to go.  The water's too effing cold.  The weather's too cold to go to the beach. 
[01:38:30]  You don't know where to go.  The beach is full of convicts.  You don't know where to go.  You don't know where to go.  That's Jones Beach.  I don't go there.  That's Jones Beach.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric.  What's up, fellas?  Make it fast.  Come on.  I just want to let you know that mead is beer made from honey.  Oh, Steve should have come running and telling us that.  Oh, beer made from honey?  Beer made from honey.  It's wonderful.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Beer made from honey.  All right.  There were a lot of bees there yesterday.  Let's go to Brenda. 
[01:39:00]  Very frightening.  Brenda.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  Hi, Brenda.  Hey.  First of all, mead is honey, sweet honey wine.  I work at the bars.  I already know it.  I know.  And secondly, Anthony, I was the crazy girl who gave you the pin at the end of the day.  Yes, she came running out at the end of the day and gave me a nice Opie and Anthony  wow pin.  So do you work there every year, miss?  I've worked there for the last 15 years of my life because I'm a loser.  15 years.  What's your job at the Renaissance Festival? 
[01:39:30]  I serve beer at the restaurant.  You serve me.  Say something.  Can you say something in older and talk, lady?  No.  I gave up my accent like 10 years ago.  Well, come on.  She gave it up.  She just said, screw it.  Good day, everybody.  I don't know.  I gave it up.  It's too early to be doing it.  Come on, ye.  Give us something.  Something from the Renaissance there.  Give us what you used to.  When you used to have a passion for it and someone would come up and go, what do you have  today, m'lady?  Actually, I come up. 
[01:40:00]  I had them come up, and it used to be, what be thy thirst?  What be thy thirst?  What be thy thirst?  What be thy thirst?  And then it goes into the Budweiser, Sam Adams.  Yeah, real old-fashioned.  Right?  Real old-y time beers.  All right, Brenda.  Thank you.  Let's go to Phlegm in Jersey.  Phlegm, what's up?  Shoot ye self.  Exactly.  Phlegm.  It's a whole day looking at hooters there, man, and cleavage. 
[01:40:30]  That's what you do.  How many times does your girlfriend catch you?  Yeah, the girls wrap themselves up in these corsets and squeeze their bosoms out of the  top so you see a lot of cleavage.  But some of the guys don't want to, like, I refuse to dress up.  I've been asked many times, I refuse.  And then it's like, well, just wear this hat.  Or just wear this.  I go, no, because you either have to go all out and wear the complete thing or just wear 
[01:41:00]  regular clothes because it would be even sillier than dressing up totally would be the  guy, because you see him walking around all the time.  He's got the jeans, the sneakers, and he's wearing, like, an oldie-time chainmail vest  and a helmet.  It's like, what are you?  But you're wearing jeans and sneakers.  The sneakers either go all out or don't do it at all.  Yeah, Jimmy and I agree.  When you're LARPing, you've got to go all out.  If it's not 100% LARPing, then you don't LARP at all. 
[01:41:30]  See, LARPing is role-playing.  Is it?  It's when you actually do what most people do online games with points and stuff.  And that's a whole game thing.  Two damage, two damage, two damage.  Right, right.  That is not happening at the Renaissance Festival.  What are some of the other things you could yell out at your fellow LARPer?  Two damage, two damage.  And they cast a spell with a beanbag.  I know they cast spells with beanbags.  Well, yeah, you won't hear me defending the LARPers. 
[01:42:00]  But I have fun at the Renaissance Festival.  Yeah.  It's, you know.  All right.  Do ye.  Ye do.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're just getting warmed up.  I would throw in lines from Superman.  Yeah.  Because they're all geeky and they know them.  And I would throw in Zod lines.  Like they would ask you something.  Because people just come up to you and go,  Have thou seen my husband?  Like trying to get some role-playing thing going.  Yeah. 
[01:42:30]  And they'll ask you about, like, why you're wearing such strange clothing.  So I'd give them the old,  Why do you ask these questions when you know I shall kill you for it?  Remember Zod from Superman?  Yeah, I do.  And they look so puzzled.  No, it was to get a complete puzzled look.  You finally leave your house and this is what you do?  It was a complete puzzled look you would get from these Renaissance Fair people.  But we would all laugh because we knew what it was.  Yeah, of course.  That's wonderful.  Here's how you should answer that. 
[01:43:00]  It's General Zod.  Yeah, it sure is.  What do they say to you?  Leaves his house for the first time in five years to do this.  They would say something like, you go, um, excuse me, where are the bathrooms?  And they go, well, does thou wish to take the bath?  And you're like, you know, you just want to take a whiz.  Now the Zod line coming up?  No, no.  Then they would go, oh, you must be looking for the privy.  For the privy.  And you laugh and you go.  I would say this, I wish you were dead. 
[01:43:30]  If they asked me a question that they wanted to role play, I wish you were dead.  I got something.  Yes?  Thou is bored.  No, it's fun.  Thou is bored.  Jimmy?  I probably wouldn't dig it.  I would go for the goof factor.  Just have a laugh.  It is really fun.  I tell you, when you go with friends, it is very fun because you do.  There are plenty of things to just go, oh, my God, look at that.  And goof on.  All right, let's go to one more call and then we take a break here. 
[01:44:00]  Dale, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  I love the show, guys.  All right.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I just wanted to see if Anthony saw the guy that looked like Scott Weil walking around  with a tambourine at the fair.  Was he the guy that tried to look like Captain Jack Sparrow?  No, no, no, no.  This guy had a bandana on.  He had one boot on and one sandal on.  And he was walking around like a freak shaking a tambourine.  Yeah, they got a lot of old hippies and weirdos there. 
[01:44:30]  And then there was a Jack Sparrow walking around, which is like, now they've introduced  pirates.  Now they've introduced pirates to the Renaissance.  And you would know the difference, right?  Pirates are calling on.  I would just assume pirates are part of the whole thing.  I don't know.  I wish.  No.  See?  No.  There weren't.  There usually weren't pirates.  I would be like, well, that pirate looks like the dress of the day.  So there must have been pirates.  Next year, I plan on screwing the whole thing up by taking a bunch of people dressed in original  classic Star Trek attire and saying that we beam down to this planet where it's exactly 
[01:45:00]  like Renaissance era Earth and just scan people with the tricorder and medical equipment and  say how we can't talk about what we're doing here because it would violate the prime directive.  And hit them with your plastic swords.  Too damaged.  Too damaged.  I have a phaser.  Why would I do that?  I would have a phaser.  That would be silly.  So that would be three damage?  That would be silly.  Because that would be a little more powerful than a plastic sword. 
[01:45:30]  1,600 damage.  He'd be dead.  I cast a spell.  Bam!  With my bean bag.  Anthony, what is it that they yell out when you give them a tip?  Huzzah!  Huzzah.  What is that?  Huzzah!  To the tipper.  Huzzah, indeed.  Huzzah.  When you give a little tip after you're done getting your beer, you give it to them and they  ring a bell.  Cling, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.  Huzzah!  To the generous tipper.  Nice.  Love the show, guys.  You've got to work for a little bit. 
[01:46:00]  Take it easy.  Yes, Jimmy.  They do an appreciation for the tip.  Huzzah!  Huzzah!  Why do thou look at me like that?  That's the noise you should make when you wake up and realize there's a large gentleman  straddling you in your bed and you feel a sharp, wincing pain.  And that's what wakes you up.  Huzzah! 
[01:46:30]  Huzzah!  Should be the sound that comes out of your mouth.  Let's go to James in New Hampshire.  James.  Hey, Jimmy, Opie.  Yeah.  I just have to know, how are you fighting off the urge to give him an atomic wedgie?  You high school geek.  Yeah, we're going to have Club Soda Kenny give you a wedgie.  I will not get a wedgie for attending the Renaissance Festival.  Many people do.  It's a very popular event every year.  It's on for weeks, a couple of weeks, and it does very well.  Yeah, all right.  I think I stuffed you in a locker at least twice in high school. 
[01:47:00]  You did not, tough guy.  And had guns.  I have a brand new rapier I'll run ye through.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  All right, let's take a break.  Just getting warmed up.  Let us taketh thine breaks.  Huzzah!  Huzzah to the break.  Huzzah!  No? 
[01:47:30]  All right, it's the one virus spreading across the land.  The realm.  The shire.  Give me some beanbags so I can cast spells all morning.  Sorry, Mike Cutback Davis.  Those guys are fags.  What?  I'm using surfer names for you.  Oh, I don't know surfer.  I don't know surfer.  Crap, I just like waves.  Just from past times. 
[01:48:00]  Come here, miss.  Huzzah!  Huzzah!  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The first.  You're poking in Anthony.  I know.  Dre from the city.  Did you guys watch the NRA meeting last weekend?  Yeah.  Charlton Heston spoke, and it was like a scene from Planet of the Apes.  He was holding a big rifle and yelling.  Funniest thing I've ever seen.  You know something?  I am a very strong advocate to the right to bear arms. 
[01:48:30]  I really am.  I'm serious.  But that Charlton Heston is an effing lunatic.  He's out of his mind.  That guy is crazy.  Looking more and more like an ape every day, too.  Oh, yeah.  He's starting to look exactly like Dr. Zayas.  Yeah.  He's getting the big protruding jaw.  Dr. Zayas.  Help me.  Sarah.  Cornelius.  Help me.  Yeah.  We got him.  He looks just like him.  Damn you.  He did that famous line. 
[01:49:00]  They get out of my gun when they pry my cold dead fingers from around me.  Damn you all to hell.  And he had the rifle up in the air.  He was holding it like Moses helped the staff.  Yeah.  And he's like holding it.  Damn you.  I was expecting him to fire a few rounds off into the ceiling.  Damn you all to hell.  Anti-gun people.  F off.  I'll treat you like I treated those gorillas on Planet of the Apes with my gun. 
[01:49:30]  Remember that?  I shot them all, bastards.  Then I fooled Dr. Zayas to come around the corner and I put the gun to his head.  That red monkey ass of his.  I believe it is the right of every American to have a Vulcan cannon in his car if he wants one.  Damn you.  And what's the problem? 
[01:50:00]  Why?  Why a problem with the theme restaurant in Times Square?  We want an NRA theme restaurant along with Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock and the Sports Cafe.  Mr. Heston, that's a little wacky.  Why damn you?  NRA theme restaurant in Times Square.  Why?  What's the difference?  It's a hobby, a sport like everyone else.  Why can you have goddamn hippie communist clothes hanging up in the Hard Rock? 
[01:50:30]  But you can't have good old American guns in a restaurant.  That's what a restaurant needs.  Come on.  We could serve the children little, like, sundaes after they eat, ice cream sundaes, with, like, magnum rounds decorating.  That'd be cute.  You'd take them home.  Little guns hanging up all over the place.  They're out of their mind, though.  An NRA theme restaurant. 
[01:51:00]  Because we were at the All-Star Cafe.  Yes.  And we ordered the Shaq Attack turkey sandwich.  Shaq Attack turkey sandwich.  Or whatever it was.  Why have that when you can have Ruby Ridge ribs?  Come on, damn you.  How about the Columbine cobbler salad?  Yes.  It's on the menu.  Or if you're watching the game.  Yeah.  What would be better than sitting down with some wacky Waco wings?  Hot wings.  Come on, damn you.  Mr. Heston, don't forget about the Luwima lasagna. 
[01:51:30]  Yes.  That'd be great.  All the waitstaff will have guns.  So if anyone tries to walk out on the check, we shoot them.  Can you imagine that?  The Kent State College crunchy chicken fingers.  There's just a few things on the menu.  Damn you.  I'll treat you like that red ass, mandrel monkey ass, gorilla ass that was trying to get me. 
[01:52:00]  On Planet of the Aids, can I say ass one more time?  Charlton Heston.  Yes.  Will you be like a hostess at the NRA theme restaurant?  I'll be the hostess.  Yeah.  And fully armed.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  When you order a steak, you go in the back and shoot at yourself. 
[01:52:30]  Come on.  I'll give you a 30 on six and you'll just pluck it off.  Pass that dumb cow over the head.  We'll hold his feet.  We'll head him and heel him with the rope.  You take out the .357 right between the horns.  And then, oh, it's so tender and juicy that way.  Would you like it?  Well done or rare so it's red like Zira's monkey ass.  Some days I'll be dressed in a loincloth. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, yuck.  Some days in a loincloth.  Some days in my outfit I had in the Omega Man.  Right.  Remember that movie?  Sure do.  What did I have in the Omega Man?  Guns and plenty of them to shoot the dead.  What happens if we're overrun with the living dead and we don't have guns to defend ourselves?  What happens if we don't have guns in this country and all of a sudden gorillas take over?  Would you like to be like those mindless people held in cages being dissected? 
[01:53:30]  Or would you like to be like Chuck Heston when I see the Statue of Liberty and I fight back with my gun?  Damn you!  Oh, you blew it up!  Remember, every Chuck Heston movie you see where I have a gun, I come out on top.  Although I died in Planet of the Apes, I died in the Omega Man.  I died in Soylent Green. 
[01:54:00]  Wait a minute.  Hold it.  That didn't work out too well.  I didn't have a gun in Ten Commandments and I lived.  I didn't have a gun in Ben Hearn.  I made it through that.  I died in the Omega Man.  Goddamn guns are screwing me up!  I died in all my gun movies!  Anthony or Mr. Heston, whoever you are right now.  Yes, damn you.

What about the Jack Ruby red wine?  Yes.  You drink that with the Cheese Harvey Oswald.  It's the burger.  Cheese Harvey Oswald.  It's a play on the name, you doffy bastard!  Well, they have a breakfast special too, Anthony.

What's her name?  Kennedy.  Jackie O.  Jackie O.  Tries to get the shell from the back of the trunk of the car and put it back on the egg.  It's so cute.  Boy, I went a long way for that dopey joke.  Bloodstained tablecloths on every table.
