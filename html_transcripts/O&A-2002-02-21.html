<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the Naughty Nighty contest, encouraging listeners to vote daily at opianthony.com.  The main focus quickly shifted to the unexpected departure of Fareed, a high-ranking executive instrumental in their re-signing with Infinity Broadcasting.  Opie and Anthony reminisced about similar experiences with previous employers, Ron Valeri and Steve Dodge, using humorous, often inaccurate, recollections and a “Brady Bunch” analogy to illustrate the situation.  A caller, Willie, voiced displeasure with their dwelling on Fareed’s exit.  This transitioned into a detailed explanation of the “55-gallon drum challenge,” a contest for women to endure increasingly uncomfortable situations inside a drum.  Becky, a contestant from near Boston, was introduced and performed a beer can trick. The conversation became highly sexually suggestive, featuring discussions of Becky’s body and sexual experiences, and numerous female callers auditioned for the challenge with increasingly outrageous suggestions, including Kelly’s hot dog proposition and a debate on its merits against a Baby Ruth.  Several callers provided “F.U.” messages, and a fictional interaction with Charlton Heston was incorporated.  Jim Norton's frequent arousal was repeatedly mentioned.

A Hollywood extra who appeared in *Bedazzled* and *Coyote Ugly* called in, boasting about accidentally grabbing Brendan Fraser's genitals during a *Bedazzled* scene. She suggested a topless slip-and-slide across the studio covered in ice cream as her “55-gallon drum challenge” entry.  Becky from Brockton then called, agreeing to eat chocolate-covered lamb eyeballs (one larger than the other due to the chef's preparation, explained later by a call with Frenchie, the chef). The discussion expanded to include other potential entries, such as a dumpster dive, and a range of sexually suggestive and outrageous stunts proposed by callers. This segment also included discussions of body modifications (piercings, tattoos, including a self-administered penile cross tattoo).  Multiple callers offered their own ideas and “F.U.” messages, with one mentioning a woman flashing her breasts on the Rosie O’Donnell show. Carrie from Philly agreed to extinguish a cigarette on her tongue for her entry, setting up a subsequent segment. Jim Norton’s upcoming shows and a Mad Magazine article referencing the show were briefly mentioned.

The show continued with a segment centering around Carrie’s cigarette trick, prompting a heated exchange with a caller, Michael, who criticized the lack of challenge. Jim Florentine was impersonated. The hosts discussed finding a dumpster and recruiting women for the “55-gallon drum challenge,”  leading to interactions with Carrie, Rick, Robin, and Mary.  These interactions involved escalating insults, threats of violence (including putting heads in toilets, using pliers), and sexually suggestive comments. Carrie eventually left the studio due to Rick's harsh treatment.  Olympic figure skater Michael Weiss called, and the conversation covered his skating career,  perceptions of homosexuality in figure skating, and judging controversies at the Olympics.  The focus returned to Carrie, and Stephanie, another potential contestant, was introduced.  Rick's behavior, seemingly influenced by cold medication, was criticized.  Ron and Fez’s arrival at the studio was mentioned, along with strong criticism of Steve Kingston, the program director.  Discussions included a "Twato" (genital herpes) segment and a bet to kiss someone with it, involving Paulo, an employee who was brought into the studio and mocked.  Stephanie agreed to a toilet-related stunt, and a final call from Holly discussed a “queef” challenge.

The broadcast continued with a nonsensical “queef” chant, Sandy Kane in the studio, and discussion of an upcoming “big fight night.” Stephanie's toilet bowl challenge was detailed, emphasizing the bathroom's unsanitary state and Stephanie's reaction.  Liza, a caller, reported multiple bathroom visits due to nerves from a previous contest. Paulo’s involvement included a challenge involving a growth on a female guest's body, “Twato,” which was graphically described.  The detailed account of Paulo’s interaction with Twato, including his use of bleach afterward, followed. Ron and Fez, guests in the studio, and their connection to Sandy Kane were discussed.  Crude banter with Sandy Kane ensued, culminating in Paulo kissing Twato. The segment concluded with further discussion of the “55-gallon drum challenge,” the fight night, and more crude commentary.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Would it be Thursday already?  That rocks.  Uh, yeah, it's Thursday.  That's pretty good.  That's what I learned today.  I learned it's Thursday.  People on tape delay are going to think it's the end of the show, Obie, if you say that's what you learned at 3 o'clock.  Oh, it's never too early to learn, Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  No.  Words to live by.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Yes.  D.C.  D.C.  Just want to wake them up a little bit down there in D.C.  Wake up.  Let it do, but not a little wake up.  They're loving Stephanie in D.C.  Oh, yeah.  One of the finalists in the Doty Nighty contest.  Make sure you vote every day.  We noticed the votes kind of trailed off a little bit. 
[00:01:00]  Did it?  A little bit.  Everyone voted for their favorite and then maybe didn't vote again.  You know what's going to happen?  You do that.  Your favorite's not going to win.  Go to opianthony.com.  Vote every day for the Naughty Nighty contest, okay?  Yeah, the votes dipped a little bit, Anthony.  Interesting.  Still a lot of people voting, but, yeah, it looks like people aren't taking advantage of the fact they got about seven votes.  Yep.  One a day until we announce the winner next Tuesday.  Yep.  And I think you should tell your friends at this point.  Yeah.  Turn them on to the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[00:01:30]  Tell them to go to opianthony.com and vote for their fave, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Yes.  Yes.  Norton, how's the bagel?  I'm chewing into the thing.  I'm chewing into the thing.  I'm chewing into the thing.  The thing that I'm chewing into.  Isn't it?  Well, Anthony, I feel a little weird today.  Yeah.  Just a little strange.  The guy that talked us into staying with the company during our tumultuous re-signing. 
[00:02:00]  You might remember that.  Those of you in New York, when we came up for, our contract was up and we had a re-sign back in, when was that, July?  June.  June.  Yeah.  It stretched out for quite a while, too.  There was one man.  One man.  Two men.  Well, there was the one guy.  The head muckety-muck.  Ken pretty much talked us into staying, and then, like, this other guy kind of put it over the top. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Ken was more like, if I could revert to a Brady Bunch episode.  Remember when Greg got the job at his father's architecture place, and he was supposed to take the plans over there, and he screwed up?  Well, Ken Stevens is like Mr. Brady.  Not a flaming fag who likes to take it in the can.  Not that way.  Although, I don't know.  I don't know his personal life. 
[00:03:00]  But he's like Mr. Brady.  I think he's married with a kid.  Right.  The other guy is like the boss of the company.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He was like Mr. Brady's boss.  Right.  Mr. Phillips.  Mr. Phillips.  Mr. Phillips.  Thank you.  God damn you, Norton Rule.  I love that.  You know that, though.  I forgot it for a second.  You had a little brain fart.  I did.  But Mr. Phillips was the boss.  You got a fever today?  You all right?  No, I'm fine.  You never mess with TV trivia. 
[00:03:30]  Sometimes the names escape me for a moment.  All right.  Little momentary laughs.  It's a big second.  It's a couple of extra foot pounds per second per second.  I love the little son of a bitch.  It's a big part of the show, though, when you can pull those things out of the air.  I understand.  You impress a lot of people out there with your TV knowledge.  Thank you.  It's my line of work.  And with you not coming up with Mr. Phillips, I'm a little nervous today.  Thank God Norton was there to back me up on that ball. 
[00:04:00]  That seems like basic TV trivia for someone like you.  It is.  All right.  I do feel bad about it.  And thank you for really twisting the screw.  Go ahead.  So Mr. Phillips is like Mr. Brady's boss.  Yeah.  So he is, to Ken Stevens, like the big boss that we were dealing with, who is Fareed.  Right.  So that's when I say the guy.  Because Greg wasn't getting the job without Mr. Phillips' approval.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  A stamp of approval.  I see.  No matter how much filibustering Mr. Brady did. 
[00:04:30]  I see.  Yeah.  So that guy that we sat down with and told us that this was the only place to be.  That Infinity Broadcasting and the whole CBS Viacom family was the place to be.  The only place to be.  The only place to be.  As I remember, if I can remember what he said sitting across from that table, you want to be with the number one company.  You want to be with the number one company. 
[00:05:00]  There's the number one company and everything else.  If you want to be with everything else, be with everything else.  But you want the number one place to be, that is here.  I think he also said, I can't think of another place I'd rather be myself.  Yeah.  Fareed what?  Fareed gone.  It's actually, this is probably boring people, but this is a huge story in the radio business, man.  Radio, as far as radio goes, yeah, huge story.  Huge story.  The guy that talked us into staying ran for the hills yesterday. 
[00:05:30]  Ran for the hills.  Don't put it like that.  The guy apparently got an offer when I found out that Iron Maiden song went through my head.  Run to the hills.  Yeah.  So, and it reminded us of a couple other occasions where this has happened to us.  Hoping this has happened to us everywhere we've worked.  Three times it has now happened to us.  Where the guy that talked us into a job we're staying at, at the radio station we were at at the time, 
[00:06:00]  ran for the hills after he talked us into staying.  Remember our old pal, Ron Valeri?  Ron Valeri, who got us the job at the AAF up there in Massachusetts.  Right.  He was telling us how great the place was as he was packing his bags and his boxes.  No, it's great.  You're going to love it.  No, it's going to, yeah, cab, limo service?  Yeah, pick me up and go to the airport.  No, it's going to be great.  You guys will love it here.  I've got to go.  Got to go.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye. 
[00:06:30]  Goodbye, goodbye.  He was the one that, uh...  It's going to be great, Doc.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  We were at WBAB on Long Island at the time, and Ron Valeri talked us into going up to Worcester to do a little radio show at WAF.  Right.  And then we got there after he told us how great the place was, and a week later he's packing his boxes and his gold records from his office,  and he couldn't be bothered with us.  Couldn't be bothered.  Goodbye. 
[00:07:00]  I think he had a big opportunity in New York at the time.  Yeah, at the time he did, yes.  He came down to New York, but now he's back in Boston, and I hear he's doing great.  And we love the guy, because he was...  Yeah, he's a good guy.  He's one of the stand-up guys that we met at WAF at the time.  Yes.  The amount I could count on one hand, and most of them are gone from that place.  They're all gone.  All gone, as a matter of fact.  Before I say all gone, let me think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, all gone.  You're right.  And then there was the head of American Radio Systems, A-R-S. 
[00:07:30]  Steve Dodge, his name was.  He bought up WAF when we were there.  Comes in.  Now we're part of a big radio conglomerate.  And he comes in and gives this big rah-rah speech.  This big corporate rah-rah speech about how this is a great company, and we're a growing company,  and the employees are going to grow along with it. 
[00:08:00]  It's a big Enron speech he's giving.  And it's going to be fantastic.  It was an Enron speech.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the first big money offer that came around to this guy, he sold the whole company.  Like, he's talking about how he's going to be there, and he's a hands-on guy.  I believe in radio, and I believe in what I'm doing.  Yeah, exactly.  Those are some of the quotes in the big conference room.  Right.  And when he left the company, you saw that smoke that usually is reserved for cartoon characters 
[00:08:30]  when they run away really quick, that smoke.  His feet went, did that Flintstone, before he left.  So it happened again.  And now Fareed, who sat with us, who really believed in us in our radio show,  and I wish him all the best, sat with us when we were hashing it out,  where is O&A going to go, what's in our best interest, 
[00:09:00]  and Fareed, boy, as far as he was concerned, man,  there was no other place to be than Infinity Broadcasting.  Unless, of course, that other place is Citadel.  Unless that place offers you more money.  Offers you a partnership.  Right.  Or something.  Well, there you go, the world of big business.  Big business.  I like them.  Yeah.  They try to be faithful to a company, but they make it so easy for you not to be. 
[00:09:30]  Just looking around and seeing what happens.  You know what it is with big business, and Enron is a great example of this.  They're still human effing beings in charge.  So if an opportunity comes up that looks a little more attractive,  your loyalty speeches go out the window.  They leave.  If any greed is there in these people, which it is.  It's a basic human thing. 
[00:10:00]  Greed is good.  Greed is good.  Wall Street.  Nice.  Anthony, I got audio of Fareed leaving the company today.  No, we don't.  It was that bad.  Jesus, I just missed him.  Wow.  You didn't have time to say goodbye to you, Ant.  God damn.  Willie, the one-legged what?  Chimp?  It says Willie, the one-legged, and then it just says CH.  Oh, now he's spelling Willie, the one-legged champion. 
[00:10:30]  What's going on, Willie?  Hey, it's Willie.  What's up?  It says Willie.  I'm sorry, Willie.  What's going on?  Nothing much, man.  I got six new heads turning, you know, on the show, changing their afternoon format,  and you're killing me about this guy leaving a period trail when he failed to build it or something, you know?  What?  I don't.  That went right over my head.  All right, I got six new guys listening to the show today, and you guys are killing me with this guy leaving or whatever.  Cool, he left, you know, tough crap, but, you know, it's probably not funny.  Dude, dude, dude, you must share it.  If you understand something, when things happen, well, hold on, you should know to shut up for a second. 
[00:11:00]  Here's how it works.  Here's how it works.  It doesn't have to be four hours of hilarity on the Opie and Anthony show.  If something's happening around the station or the company we work for, we like letting the people in on it.  We're not going to dwell on this for an hour.  Oh, we are?  Yeah, you are.  No, we're not.  I'm teasing, of course.  If it doesn't, you'll phone you in 20 minutes, man.  But, hey, we still have five minutes, my friend.  No, I think a lot of people can relate to this, though. 
[00:11:30]  There's a lot of people that are in situations where someone talks them into staying with the company because it's the best,  and they can't think of another place they'd rather be, and they talk you into staying.  Because they had to talk us into staying at the time, big time.  And now one of the guys that was crucial to us, re-signing with this company, he just ran for the hills.  I think that's an interesting story.  Actually, I do have a quote from Fareed.  Hey, Willie, the one looking chimp leaving, bye. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  The champion, sorry.  A quote from Fareed.  I'm over here now.  Oh, really?  I was over there, now I'm over here.  I'm over here now.  And him deciding, like, talking into staying and then deciding just to take all that's happened in every relationship I've ever been in.  No, we can work it out, really, and the next thing you know, blah, blah, blah.  But he's 6'5 with good abs.  There you go.  Oh, God.  See, now everyone can relate.  So you'll learn that in radio, Jim. 
[00:12:30]  You've got to relate to your audience.  So you helped us out there.  Maybe we were being a little too vague and it was going over some people's heads, but you brought it home with that.  Bridged the gap.  Are you feeling a little dejected or rejected, Opie?  Are you feeling a little of that?  We had a lot of power that we just lost yesterday.  Huh?  We had some power.  We lose half our political contacts. 
[00:13:00]  Half our power.  The old man leaves.  I say we sign with Mel.  We finally found someone in this company that understood our side.  Oh, yeah.  Let's just put it that way.  He understood.  You were as much employees to him.  Opie and Anthony, why are you holding these Infinity Broadcasting executives like so many coins in your pocket?  Let us wet our beaks. 
[00:13:30]  He understood our side, Anthony.  Well, yeah.  But I don't know who's in charge of the ship right now.  Who's in charge?  Who's at the rudder?  Who's at the helm?  Ken Stevens.  Ken Stevens.  Ken hates when things like this happen because he looks at just opportunity missed.  Like if he was in charge of a station that was doing well, maybe he'd be in line to be bumped up.  That's how it works.  It's a whole domino thing.  You know, one guy leaves.  It creates a void that is then taken up by the next guy in line, and then his position's taken up. 
[00:14:00]  So everyone clicks up a notch, but it all depends on your position in the company at the time this happens.  Correct.  Now, if Ken was in charge of a station that was doing very well in the ratings and stuff, it might be considered one of those young go-getters.  And been looked at like maybe he could be the next guy.  Instead, I went to lunch with Ken today, and he said he had something to do after lunch. 
[00:14:30]  Uh-oh.  And he was heading toward Kinko's.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Stop it.  One-way ticket to Palookaville.  Palookaville.  That's why I'm grabbing the garbage pails and emptying them.  Is that a part of the...  He was...  There was a couple shops.  It was either a Kinko's...  Yeah.  ...or the gun shop right next door.  Ah.  That'll be interesting.  I heard he was going to a skeet shooting with Jason Williams.  Is that true?  Is that true? 
[00:15:00]  I didn't know they were friends.  He heard that Jason needed a place to go.  He was going to drive?  A shooting partner.  He was going to drive somewhere.  Could you imagine your friends with Jason Williams, and he goes, you want to go hunting or something?  You want to go shoot?  What would you say?  No.  I didn't know about that Wayne Krabet thing.  You hear that?  Yeah.  He almost killed Wayne Krabet.  Yeah.  He blows his shotgun off while they're skeet shooting together in his backyard.  And the muzzle of the gun was real close to Krabet's face.  He got powder burns on the side of his face, and it knocked him the hip out. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, Krabet, you got knocked the hip out.  We all saw Jason Williams in a shotgun on MTV Cribs.  Now you see it on the cover of...  I got this New York Post.  The Post.  The New York Post.  This is yesterday's Post.  Yeah, it's got him and his shotgun.  It looks like one of those shots you see out of Field and Stream.  He's looking up.  He's got a shotgun in his hand.  And it turns out his family... 
[00:16:00]  Oh, my God.  Guns should just be kept away from the whole Klan.  Do you have to use the word Klan?  I know.  I'm sorry.  That would be C-L-A-N, right, Ann?  Right.  Okay.  Do they have the family's history with guns?  Yeah, I guess the father killed...  In here?  The father killed somebody, right?  Right.  Here it is.  When he was 12, his mother, Barbara, grabbed his dad E.J.'s gun and fired three shots into the bathroom where the father was showering because he cheated on him. 
[00:16:30]  His mother then chased the father around with a butcher knife.  Two years earlier, Williams beat a 19-year-old at pool, but the older boy wouldn't pay the quarter bet.  He hit Williams with a pool cue.  Williams said his father arrived in a car with a .45 Magnum license plate, hit the older boy with a cue, and then shot the boy in the buttocks with a handgun.  On the next page of this book here, Williams describes one of his brothers, Gregory, shooting his other brother, Stacy, twice in the legs and back with a .410 shotgun. 
[00:17:00]  After Stacy persisted in throwing high fastballs at Gregory's head while playing baseball.  Williams' dad is described as a young man severely knifing a man who attacked him.  And Williams tells of his grandfather using a shotgun to ward off the white men looking to retaliate.  Using a shotgun to ward off the white men looking to retaliate. 
[00:17:30]  Doug from Springfield, what's up?  What's up?  How crazy was that family?  They were pretty messed up, right?  The mother's going in the bathroom shooting a shotgun because the father's cheating on him.  Who got the live ammo?  Who got the live ammo?  That's the day at the Williams' house.  That must have been a wild little upbringing.  A lot of party with a lot of liquor, they said.  Yeah.  A lot of drinking going on.  Well, yeah.  Jason Williams loves a good party. 
[00:18:00]  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Doug.  Sam from Hoboken saying, I guess Tom from New Orleans is ratcheting up.  No, Tom doesn't have a snowballed chance in hell of getting anywhere in the company.  He's not even with the company.  No.  Hey, this is a good chance for me.  Maybe they'll hire me.  I hear there's an opening at your corporation.  I got my resume.  Well, we figured we'd share with you today, and a few people didn't enjoy that. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Gee, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How y'all doing today?  All right.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  How's D.C. today?  Oh, man.  We doing good down here.  We lovely, man.  All right.  Down here chilling, listening to y'all.  Y'all know how it is.  Hey, did Ms. Cleo call you recently?  Hey, nah.  She didn't call me.  That sounds like, uh, who, who, who are you, lady?  That does sound like it.  All right.  That's a good one.  That's a good one. 
[00:19:00]  Hold on.  I got to play this now.  Who are you?  Who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  Hey, that sounds like you.  That sounds like you a little bit.  For real.  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, but, uh, hey, check this out, fellas.  Whatever happened in the company, man, make sure they keep y'all in in D.C., man.  We just, we picking up on y'all.  I think, uh, you know, we're not going to exaggerate here.  I think, I think we're, uh, we'll be just fine for now.  Oh, I think so.  I think we're pretty firmly entrenched in the company.  Now, you know what?  Our whole goal was to, uh, get so involved and syndicated and get our tentacles entwined 
[00:19:30]  in so many little places that we're, we're like a tumor to rip out.  We want to feel like that inoperable cancerous tumor around your brain stem.  It just can't come out.  It's going to kill you.  Right, right.  Because you would have to remove too much of the entire head.  It's too much of the head to get to it.  That's why the more markets we get, the better we just entwine in.  I like your analogy.  Entwine in.  Right.  Hey, but, uh, hey, number 97 on the, uh, the Naughty Naughty Contest. 
[00:20:00]  Naughty Naughty Contest, yes.  Last shot.  Oh, man, that's money from behind.  You like her, huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's looking at number.  Is she the, uh, the girl from Boston?  Yeah, she's from Boston.  I can't believe I know the numbers.  Well, I ain't calling you ladies.  Are you voting every day there, G?  Oh, yeah, trying to, man.  Well, the voting, uh, you know, it dipped a little bit overnight.  We're hoping all you guys take your voting seriously and vote every single day and pass the word to everybody else.  Oh, yeah, I just submitted my vote right now, you know. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Hey, I just want to let you know, Norton, you rock, man.  I can't wait for you to come down to D.C. so we can party together.  Thank you, mister.  All right, man, I'll holler to you.  All right, son.  Take care.  Hi, Jim Norton.  Hi, this is Jason Williams.  How much you want for eatabullet.com?  I think that'd be a good family website for the Williams family.  I wasn't even going to plug Eatabullet.  Or my town hall show.  Your town hall show. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, you.  Come on.  Jamie, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I wanted to see, how do you know you're going to do more good or if the radio's been dropped now?  What do you mean?  Oh, there's some kind of a little tiff between Infinity Broadcasting and Arbitron as far as what they charge for that.  That'll be settled by the time that it comes out.  Yeah, and you know what?  People think we're talking too inside right now.  That whole discussion will bring it way inside.  Yeah, I just want to clear it up. 
[00:21:30]  No one will understand that discussion at all.  All right, Jamie, thank you.  All right, have a good day, guys.  All right.  See, either way, we'll find out how we're doing.  Of course.  You've got to think, right?  Don't you sweat it.  I don't know for sure, but I would assume that would be the case.  Mm-hmm.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Well, what happened?  Mike from the Bronx says it all.  He goes, does Jason Williams' backyard look like a scene from Black Hawk Down?  He goes, does Jason Williams' backyard look like a scene from Black Hawk Down?  Wow.  Wow.  RPGs and everything. 
[00:22:00]  Yo, man, you want to shoot this RPG?  Hey, do we have our girl coming down from Boston today to try out for the fifth five-gallon drum challenge?  Is she the girl that's going to eat the chocolate-dipped...  What's her gig?  Sheep eyes?  I forgot.  I thought she was the chocolate sheep-eye girl, but she could be the headstand discipline girl.  Well, the headstand discipline girl would be great.  Yellow discipline girl.  Either way, we went.  Either way, we went.  Well, I came in with the chocolate-covered lamb eyes and for care of Frenchie. 
[00:22:30]  Where are they?  He dropped them off.  They're in the refrigerator.  Huh?  Could someone go get them?  I want to check them out real fast.  Yeah, let's get them in the fridge.  How did someone run down and get them?  They look very tasty.  You can't see them.  They're covered in chocolate.  But inside is a gooey eyeball.  And then he goes,  And for a special extra thing, I threw in the chocolate-covered tongue.  So he took the lamb tongue, this pointy, disgusting lamb tongue,  and it's covered in chocolate and a lovely nutty cup of chocolate-covered cherries. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, that's exactly what it looks like.  But inside is a lamb eye.  But when you bite it, you'll taste the sweetness of chocolate and whatever eyeball fluid tastes like.  Is that sick?  Ah, and we're also looking for other ladies to call up and try out for the 55-gallon drum challenge, all right?  We've got to get serious with this damn contest.  So we want to try to do it within a week or a week and a half.  We've got to, like I said, in the, you okay there, Noe?  What happened?  What happened?  I sneezed.  Oh, you sneezed. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, okay.  I thought you were choking.  I had to do a Heimlich maneuver.  I might pretend.  Hold me close.  Grab me tight.  Here they are.  Let me see.  Pass them down.  You can't even tell.  No.  Pass them down.  They almost look tasty.  Oh, those look good.  Oh, my God.  I have prepared them.  Look at the tongue, though.  It's pointy at the tip like a goat tongue.  Why only one?  Oh, there's the other eye.  There's two eyes in there.  What do you mean you can't tell?  You can't.  They're covered in chocolate.  Yeah, but you know, if you know.  With the nutty, cover-y, wonderful. 
[00:24:00]  He probably used his best chocolate in everything, right?  Yeah, he did.  All right.  Put your eye in my chocolate.  Put your chocolate in my eye.  Put that somewhere back in the fridge.  Yeah.  All right.  Is it in the fridge outside?  Because I'm horrified to think someone would go, ooh, chocolate.  Yeah, it is.  If they're going to actually eat somebody else's little dessert, that's what you deserve.  Right.  You deserve eyeball juice squirting in your mouth.  Ugh.  All right, our first little break here.  Why don't we go right to the F.U. line? 
[00:24:30]  Looks like the F.U. line's pretty busy today.  Running.  And more of your phone calls in just a bit.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  This F.U. goes out to Wayne Gretzky, who lives in L.A. in the United States, has an American  wife, has American kids, and has American money in his back pocket, and has no money.  No balls to save his own Canadian team. 
[00:25:00]  Instead, he saves an American team.  And is a big f***ing hypocrite for putting on the American flag and wiping it with his ass.  Well, Wayne Gretzky from Christian and Buffalo, f*** you, you piece of s***.  Next message.  This is a big F.U. to Molly Ringwald, who hasn't done anything since 16 Candles.  My wife and I and a hundred other people were waiting out in the cold to get into Caroline's in New York on Saturday night. 
[00:25:30]  And her and her posse walked right past everybody into the building.  F.U., Molly.  You're still worthless, and you never did anything.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to my company who's laying off more drivers this week because their f***ing crack sales team couldn't sell food to starve an Ethiopian.  I hope the place falls and shuts down.  F*** you, you dickheads.  End of message.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here is where we really separate the champions from the chumps. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, my God, that's horrible.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yo, yo.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  What do you think of, stupid?  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Suck it.  My bad.  You like movies about gladiators.  My bad.  Suck it.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Charlton Heston checking in on the instant feedback, Anthony.  Damn.  By the way, a little side note, Dan from Hoboken, you're cracking us up today.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  Charlton Heston writes today, Jason Williams didn't kill him, the gun did. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  Damn you all to hell.  Damn you.  It's called an accidental exercising of your Second Amendment rights.  Damn you all to hell.  When I was filming Planet of the Apes, I had a gun right at the end of it. 
[00:27:30]  And all the apes had guns, and they fired him fine.  No, I'm not going to make any analogy.  I don't see the problem. 
[00:28:00]  If a man wants to shoot his chauffeur, so be it.  Guns don't kill people.  Jason Williams' family's killed people.  Don't blame the gun.  Damn you all to hell.  Why blame the gun?  Does it matter?  A lot of people accidentally exercise their constitutional right. 
[00:28:30]  A little pull of the trigger.  Oops.  You're exercising your rights under the Constitution, whether you wanted to or not.  No, Rick, shut up.  Put that down.  Look, I taught you to smile.  Nova.  Nova.  Damn, I shouldn't have been juggling that.  Jason taught me a good trick, Nova.  Sit down. 
[00:29:00]  Now watch this.  I, I, I caught the guns as I'm juggling.  Don't you like, oh.  I'm sorry.  Damn you.  Dance.  Dance, Jason.  I can teach him a thing or two.  Dance.  Boy.  Oh, I didn't mean that.  I'm too old to be racist.  I'm at the age I can say anything, no matter how stupid it is, and get away with it.  Damn you all to hell. 
[00:29:30]  Damn awesome, damn.  I just got my horse.  I see nothing wrong with it.  Look at that.  Sometimes I just like sneaking up behind Garrett Morris.  Look at him jump.  Another man who was on the wrong side of a gun.  Chauffeur.  Chauffeur.  Chauffeur. 
[00:30:00]  By the way, on a side note, our thunderclap sucks.  This doesn't work anymore.  Yeah.  Something a little more crisp.  A little cracking.  A little crackle.  Frankie, what's going on, man?  You guys got to break out that old Garrett Morris bit from Saturday Night Live at Facing  William.  Gonna get me a shotgun and get all the white as I see.  He sung that live on our show, by the way.  That was hilarious. 
[00:30:30]  All right, Frankie.  We're going to find that.  Thank you.  All right, fellas.  All right.  Well, Anthony, the chick from Boston has arrived.  And what is her gig?  She wants in on the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Her name's Becky.  And she's the one that wants to eat the sheep eye that is covered with chocolate.  But before we invite Becky in, we should tell all the other ladies listening to us that,  you know, this spot's open for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We should explain the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[00:31:00]  Yes.  We put you in a drum, and then we dump all sorts of things into the drum and see how much  you could take.  At any time, you could say, I'm done.  Get me out of here.  I give up.  And we'll get you out of there in seconds.  Right.  Okay?  Last girl on the drum is going to win something really, really good.  But we're talking about possibly a really good trip, maybe cold, hard cash.  Or maybe, can I say a jet ski?  Possibly a jet ski.  You could say it.  Yeah.  You could say Aztec, too.  Just don't do it.  It's going to be something really, really good. 
[00:31:30]  Okay?  Talk about it.  Now, this is one of our more special things we do on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  So we want the girls to earn their spot in the drum.  Would you call this a benchmark event?  It's a benchmark, yeah.  What are you laughing at?  Andy's blog.  All right.  Print it up.  We'll read Andy's little quick.  Yeah.  So, you know, we want the girls to kind of impress us and come up with things they would do to  kind of try out to impress us.  And then we'll give you a spot on the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[00:32:00]  Becky's the first girl.  I know.  We've had other girls, but they were bitches that stood us up.  Right.  We had a girl who was supposed to do a headstand and do the yellow discipline.  Well, someone might take that idea from Cleveland.  I think she's coming down Monday.  She's driving all the way from Cleveland just to try out for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Believe me, if I see her, she will be corrected.  I love that, guys.  Mr. Grady.  Mr. Grady?  Classic. 
[00:32:30]  She had to be corrected.  So, we're looking for the other ladies to call us up and tell us what they would do to get in the 55-gallon drum challenge, right?  Yeah.  We have another girl coming down today, Rick.  Yeah, a girl from Philly.  We got the pretzel girl?  Yeah.  See, we weren't impressed with her ideas.  Yeah, but she's kind of spiced it up a little bit.  She's going to try to spice it up?  She'll spice it up.  All right, because she could, I don't know, twist herself into a human pretzel thing.  A lot of people believe she hasn't the belly for it. 
[00:33:00]  Very good.  That is so great, man.  All right, why don't we say how to Becky, then?  All right, Lloyd.  Let's bring Becky in.  Your money's no good here, Mr. Torrance.  Hair of the dog that fits me.  Hey, how you doing?  Wow, wing.  Nice.  Where are you from?  I'm from near Boston.  You're from Brockton, right?  Well, right near Brockton.  Brockton. 
[00:33:30]  In Brockton.  She wants to be a waitress at a strip club, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, proxy lady in Brockton.  All right.  You said your ass was too big.  It is.  No, what are you talking about?  Go over there so we can take a look.  Get out of here.  Are you a nice dumper?  Turn it around.  What are you kidding?  There have been bigger asses than that.  Yeah.  That works.  You got ample cannage.  Especially for Brockton, that works.  Works nice.  So that ain't a problem.  For a white girl in Brockton.  Thank you.  I like that loose look.  A white girl in Brockton with a big butt.  She got that...  It's not even that big.  What look would you call that, Opie? 
[00:34:00]  It's the look you appreciate.  What?  What?  White and breathing.  Like you use the same phrase to describe Courtney Love.  Dirty little whore?  No, you got the dirty little whore is good.  No, you got a little skank to you.  A little skank to you.  I like a little skank.  In a good way, though.  Yeah.  Like a ripped up shirt held together with the safety pin on top.  The jeans are falling down.  She's got her belly hanging out.  She don't even care.  Do you have a bra on?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we see what you got there? 
[00:34:30]  No, not the bra.  Hey.  Look at that.  Wow.  What do you think, Norton?  That was a nice surprise.  Very applause-worthy.  Yes.  Very nice.  Very, very pleasing.  Sure.  And a natural blonde?  Yeah.  Good job.  What do you mean?  I used to be this color.  My hair's a little darker than this.  Oh, yeah?  Darker.  What about down below?  Yeah, it's like the color of my eyebrows.  Oh, like your eyebrows down there.  Well, what about that?  You know, how about your old...  Well, that's what we're talking about, Norton.  What the hell did you...  Way to be with us. 
[00:35:00]  I brought this beer can in because I want to show you guys something.  Oh, what do you got it?  I'll take my tongue ring out first.  She's got a beer can.  She's brought it in.  She's taking her tongue ring out.  What kind of beer is that?  Yeah, what kind of beer is that there, Becky?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Beamish?  Somebody gave it to me.  What the hell?  Where'd you get that?  It's like fake Guinness.  Oh, God.  I don't think it.  Oh, that must be heinous.  Wait, the girl wants to do a beer trick and you guys gave her that?  No, I haven't.  We didn't give it to her.  My friend had it in his bag.  I think the can is what counts, isn't it?  Yeah.  Beamish.  It's a Guinness rip-off.  Look.  Because it's a little big. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, it's probably so bad, Ben.  I just met my wife.  Well...  I know where this is going.  Where does she...  What do you do?  She doesn't know if she can do it because it's a little big.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Okay, picture...  Picture a...  Picture a can of beer.  Yeah, your mouth is wrapped way around...  I like to think of it as a gun right here at the temple.  Oh, and her going...  Oh, please!  She put the can of beer in her mouth.  I can put my fist in my mouth, too.  She said, you can put your fist in your mouth?  Oh, my God.  I put my fist in your mouth?  Wait. 
[00:36:00]  Now, that's easy, of course.  I used to stick whole apples in my mouth when I was a kid.  Did you?  Yeah.  Where did Apple live?  Did you do the fist trip?  Yeah, we want to see the fist.  I think the fist thing is...  Wait, where's that Steve?  Is he going to film it?  Steve is in Vegas.  What's Steve doing in Vegas?  Losing money.  Steve, what...  Is he on vacation?  Steve went to Vegas.  What a zilch.  He should call us from Vegas.  How much for stomach staples?  I want to trade in my stomach staples.  Steve from foundrymusic.com is...  Hanging in Vegas.  Nice buffet. 
[00:36:30]  Good food.  Plenty of it.  Wow.  I know.  Godfather 2.  Oh, nice.  Is it?  That was right.  And 20 legs of lamb.  Yeah, we don't have...  Oh, Stinky's coming into videotape.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness.  Is that your friend looking in going, oh, my God, what is she doing?  Your friends are, like, freaking out.  All right.  Well, let's see the fist trick.  This is my patty trick.  Yeah, patty trick.  She likes to potty. 
[00:37:00]  She's a patty girl.  All right, she's ready.  I'm going to do it again.  Yeah.  There we go.  All right.  Wow.  Rick's taking a picture for opianthony.com.  That's pretty impressive.  I want to see the fist, though.  Oh, look, she's got...  It's kind of hard to take out.  It gets looked on your teeth.  Well, no, I put it in the wrong way.  Oh, you did?  I put it in the wrong way.  I hate that, huh?  You brush your hair back away just to get the thing taken.  I made it.  Wow.  You did, did you?  It's like, just pull that thing and choke her with it.  Oh, I love that.  Could you look scared? 
[00:37:30]  Do you use that talent for other things?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Definitely.  You're pretty good at the Hummers and the BJs and whatnot?  Yeah.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Hey, how about that?  Wait, let's see the fist.  Let's see the fist.  Oh, you do?  That's important.  Let's see the fist before she puts her jewelry back.  I haven't done my fist in a while.  You haven't done your fist in a while, huh?  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  She gets it right in there.  It's like a German porno.  It's actually easier to do my fist than that.  Yeah?  Pretty popular with the gentleman, are you? 
[00:38:00]  Really?  Wow.  Bart, what's going on?  Hey, man, how you doing, brother?  All right.  Hey, listen.  Hey, listen.  There's a little theory here.  It's called the big box theory.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, listen.  Now, the other way is that if she has big eyebrows, a big nose, and very full, full lips,  well, she kind of demonstrated that, but that means she has a very, very big area down below.  And I'd love to have you guys try to prove that.  You sound like a serial killer.  Yeah.  What do you mean by big, sir?  Do you mean used big or just naturally swollen? 
[00:38:30]  No, just like, um, not naturally swollen.  Just like nice and like, um, you said, you know, two weeks ago.  What?  Two filet mignons together.  Meaty.  Very, very meaty and warm.  Puffy.  Oh.  All right.  Let's go see it to you guys.  All right.  All right there, Pally.  Thank you, Bart.  Take care, brothers.  There he goes.  Thank you.  He's not angry.  Tell me your eyebrows are meaty.  Have you eaten lamb eyeballs before? 
[00:39:00]  No, I have not.  You haven't.  I've never even seen them.  Well, unfortunately, you're not going to be.  We should have had a couple without the chocolate covering, so she could have seen what it looked like.  I like the surprise.  She's going to have a nice surprise.  Yeah, I'm afraid there's like goopy stuff inside.  Oh, no.  Eyeballs are very dry things.  We once had a guy eat, I think it might have been lamb eyes on our show.  Oh, really?  It's a little juicy, and you cannot chew the lens, by the way.  I believe there is a, yeah, that there's the lens. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, you have to peel them.  You will have to swallow the lens part.  Maybe Frenchie took the lens out.  Maybe he prepared it the proper way so you can eat it.  Eat it.  Suck the eye.  Suck it.  My bad.  My bad.  Now, are we in agreement if she eats both lamb eyes covered with chocolate that she's in the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Oh, absolutely.  Yes.  How was your trip, by the way?  It was all right.  Yeah.  It was kind of a long run.  Is it? 
[00:40:00]  What, three hours, three and a half?  No, we left at like 10.30.  And you just got here?  Yeah.  What the hell is that about?  What, did you take the back roads?  No, we went 44 to 95 en masse.  4 to 95?  Carriage ride would have been faster.  We were going to go 495 to 95.  You've got to take the pike, and then you go, oh, my God.  No, the pike goes the other way.  No, no, no.  No, you take the pike to 8.  On a map, it kind of looks like it goes the other way, but it's shorter.  You go through Hartford, and then you take the hand.  The pike goes the other way.  The pike goes the other way. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, yeah, it does.  Right into the Atlantic.  I went to MapQuest.com, and they told me to go.  MapQuest stinks.  Yeah, MapQuest does blow.  And my computer, my printer doesn't work, so I had to write it all down.  Yeah.  Do you put your printer in your mouth?  No?  Do you have a gentleman friend?  I have a friend.  A boyfriend, I mean.  No, a friend.  Oh, the guy with privileges.  Yeah.  How often would you say per week do you have sexual relations?  As much as I can.  Really?  You dig it.  It's only with one person currently.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay. 
[00:41:00]  Well, Norton, I see your lovely junk just standing at attention through your pants.  You don't have to go showing everybody.  It's funny to watch you evolve, Ant.  Yeah.  At the beginning, you were just so disgusted by it.  But after a while, you just kind of have to accept the fact that Jim's going to have this happening every effing show.  I'm playing foosball outside.  Jim walks up and goes, Ant, look.  He grabs his junk through his pants, and I just look over while I'm taking a shot.  And I go, oh, nice C. 
[00:41:30]  And I go back to playing.  It really bugged me.  It bothers him when I don't get upset.  Eventually, he'll go away.  We're all numb to it at this point.  God.  You're numb to Norton's sick.  Well, yeah.  Take it how you want.  What are you going to do?  And who are your pals?  You want to bring them in?  Sure.  Maybe we can get a little more insight into what you're all about.  Hey, how you doing?  This is Nicole.  Nicole.  This is our friend Stephanie.  And Stephanie.  I'm sorry. 
[00:42:00]  Her sister Stephanie is.  You guys are all from Brockton?  No, from Tartan.  Tartan.  Tartan.  Tartan.  Are you from Tartan?  Tartan.  Guy's got a Lemmy for President shirt on there from Motorhead.  Oh, nice.  There you go.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Love me like a reptile.  Very pleasing.  Nice.  There you go.  And how do you know her?  Just hang out with her?  I've known Stephanie for a long time.  Yeah?  Just like through friends.  Do you guys make out and stuff? 
[00:42:30]  The party where I lost my voice was at her house, and I met her sister.  Oh, yeah?  And I've known him forever.  Oh, your sister?  No, we really haven't made him out yet.  I wanted to make out.  Do you want to make out with her?  I want to make out.  Huh?  You want to make out with her?  Becky, do you want to make out with me?  Is that your friend with privileges?  Yeah.  I like him.  He looks like either James Hetfield or Amish.  I can't tell.  He's frightening me.  I love this guy.  He was saying today how he wanted those Jewish curls.  Really?  Is this one?  Yeah, just one right here.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  When we get back, Becky, from Brockton. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  We'll be eating sheep eyes covered in chocolate.  Covered in chocolate, fun.  For her bid to participate in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  If she eats both eyes, she's in the 55-gallon drum challenge, okay?  Exactly.  All right.  Dazzle Opie and Anthony with your brilliance now.  In New York, call 877-692-1027.  Nationally, 866-2774.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:43:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Who is that?  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We need to spend some time on this 55-gallon drum challenge.  We've got to get the girls.  We have one girl standing by to eat the lamb eyes covered in chocolate.  Chocolate covered lamb eyes.  Carrie from Philly has arrived.  Yeah.  She's going to attempt to represent Philly in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Is she the one that said she was really hot?  Yeah.  So was that her friend that just ran in here? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  You know what I could use right now?  A nice can of Beamish.  Just the thought of a fake Guinness is disgusting me.  Guinness is so good. 
[00:44:30]  All right.  We have another girl calling in.  We want the girls to call in and tell us what they would do to get in on the 55-gallon  drum challenge.  You've got to impress us, ladies.  This is a huge benchmark for the Opie and Anthony show.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hey.  How's it going?  All right.  Hey.  Kelly?  Yeah.  We're rocking and rolling.  Hello.  You've got to know the sound.  Let's go.  I'm here.  What do you want to do?  I'll do anything, but I was thinking about... 
[00:45:00]  Hey.  All right.  Well, wow.  Did that make the air?  Probably not, but we enjoyed hearing it.  Did Grandpa Walton dump out of that?  You can't be that specific.  Well, we'll clean it up for her, because you know what's going to happen.  She's going to explain it another way, and we're going to have to dump out.  We'll dump out again.  Twice.  So, let's just say she wants to eat something out of her girlfriend's balloon knot.  That's good.  All right.  And what would you be eating out of her balloon knot? 
[00:45:30]  The nastiest thing I can think of.  I don't care.  It doesn't matter.  The nastiest thing.  How about chocolate pudding?  How about what?  Chocolate pudding.  Sounds good.  Actually, butterscotch pudding would be even worse.  How about butterscotch pudding?  No, but that's kind of good.  Like, not to eat that.  Yeah, but you know what?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I need to debate this with you.  Okay, go ahead.  Debate it, because I'll debate it right back. 
[00:46:00]  Chocolate pudding, very yummy.  You're right.  Yeah.  But I think your brain's going to eff up everything when the brain looks to see where you're eating  it from.  Not on somebody that you're kind of digging and been with and hanging and having sex with.  Yeah, I dig her.  Yeah, see?  So, it doesn't matter.  I'm not...  Believe me, I ain't into the food thing.  Hold on.  Are you a lesbian?  No, I just like chicks.  I like dudes, too, so...  Yeah.  Not a fag, but I love C.  Wait a minute. 
[00:46:30]  So, have you done anything with this girl in the past?  Definitely, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, then it might have a point, then.  Yeah, see?  It's like, I'm not into the food thing, but if I was...  How about a New York City hot dog?  What's that?  Just a regular hot dog?  Just like...  Does it have to be sticking up?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's going to be displayed nicely.  Do I have to eat the whole thing?  How about the New York City hot dog?  It's displayed nicely, and you've got to eat the whole thing. 
[00:47:00]  Eat the whole thing.  You're in the contest.  I'm very big.  Would she be into this?  The hot dogs are nice size, yeah.  She'll do it for me, yeah.  She'd be into it?  Yeah, I feel durable.  And would she actually put the hot dog a little bit in the balloon nut?  Definitely, yeah.  And you could eat it right down to the nub.  All right, I will.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  And that wouldn't...  You know what?  The food wouldn't gross you out.  I've actually been eating balloon nuts and had like a little paper.  You ever have that? 
[00:47:30]  You ever have that?  We all have, Jim.  This morning, oh.  The paper.  And they always look back and go, what, what?  Nothing.  Give you the fisheye.  What was that?  Nothing.  Kelly?  Yeah?  You're clearing my throat.  When can you do this?  When is it?  Friday?  No, see, this is just a qualifying.  I know, I know.  So I'd have to do it before when?  But let's just put it this way.  I would do it as soon as possible, because as soon as we get enough ladies, then the qualifying is over. 
[00:48:00]  Well, can I come Monday?  You can.  Yes, you can.  All right, cool.  All right, hold on the line for details, okay?  Okay.  Now, hold on.  Kelly?  Yes?  Girls blow us off all the time.  Come on, I'm not going to blow you off, I promise.  I really want to be in this.  All right, if you're not serious, though, I mean, it was a fun little gag.  You know, you got to hear about your lesbianism with your friend.  No, no, I really want to be in this.  And the whole thing was twisted enough where people got a nice visual, but if the gag is over, you got to let us know.  No, I really want to be in this, I promise.  Kelly, blow us off, and you will be corrected. 
[00:48:30]  You can whip me just if I blow you off.  Well, Ken is suggesting that.  I really don't like that.  You can't do that.  Hold on, our listeners really help us out with the show.  I thought the hot dog was good enough, but Ken.  Hot dog, only good if you could want.  Exactly.  All right, well, Ken on line nine says, how about a baby Ruth bar?  Ah, well, remember the scene from Caddy Show.  All melty and good.  I don't care what it is.  I don't care what it is.  Melty and chocolatey.  That's twisted, too. 
[00:49:00]  What's more twisted?  Hot dog?  It's so big.  Hey, hey, hey, you got to watch the way you're talking.  Blue nut.  You have a potty mouth.  Yeah, and she really had a potty mouth on Monday.  I'm bad, I know.  No, you're supposed to say, my bad.  My bad.  My bad.  My bad.  I don't care what it is.  My bad.  I'll eat it.  I'll eat it.  I don't care.  All right, so what are we going to decide?  We should decide right now, Ant.  Baby Ruth or hot dog? 
[00:49:30]  Ruth or hot dog.  I'm still with the hot dog.  I think meat is really more disgusting.  Baby Ruth is sweet.  A hot dog, you're going to have those awful burps.  Yeah, it's almost like the pudding, you know, the candy bar.  Oh, right.  But I think a hot dog, because a hot dog will fit snugly.  Hey, can we use...  You hope.  Can we use...  Hey, where'd the hot dog go? 
[00:50:00]  Little kid in a well.  Ah, we've seen the Blaster hot dog.  Someone have a flashlight.  Where'd it go?  Hey, Kelly.  Yeah.  Can we use a little mustard or ketchup just to spice it up a little bit?  Yes, you can.  Just to get the hot dog in place, if you know what I mean.  Yes, yes, that's fine.  All right.  Go check out the hot dog.  I like mustard.  You like mustard?  Yeah.  I bet you do, you spicy little gal.  I love it.  Hold on the line, Kelly.  We'll have you down here Monday to do this, okay? 
[00:50:30]  Excellent.  Thank you, guys.  By the way, all the girls traveling from other cities to try out for this 55-gallon drum challenge,  we're going to totally take care of you when you come to the air.  Yeah, that's great.  We rock even more.  That's just how dedicated we really are.  Yeah, I understand.  Well, I don't know what we have laying around the joint, but we'll take care of you guys.  Oh, we will hook you up.  Just for stopping by and trying out.  So hold on a line, Kelly, all right?  All right, thanks.  Robert Hayward here from Maryland saying,  Oh, and A, you ignorant fools.  Beamish is not fake Guinness.  There are about a million different stout beers, and Beamish is a damn good one.  Blah, blah, blah.  Shut up.  The can looks like they're trying to rip off Guinness with the same colors, and it's a stout. 
[00:51:00]  I know there are plenty of other stouts, but when you talk about the best one, you're talking about Guinness,  and they are trying to rip off.  You ever see the store brand shampoos that try to look like, you know, oh, it's neck and chest,  and it's like the same logo as head and shoulders?  You know who they're trying to rip off.  Other things.  Yeah, you ever see those other store brands?  Perch.  There's perch shampoo, and then there's spurt. 
[00:51:30]  It's just like, they try to make it look like, like maybe you go, oops, let me see the can.  Oh, stop, with the same color black and the tan thing, and a, and please, a Guinness knockoff.  Everyone knows you love your beer, right?  Of course.  Have you ever seen Beamish?  No, I've never seen Beamish.  Bob Hayward from Maryland, you jack, uh-uh, uh-uh, tool.  We can't lose any more listeners from Maryland.  Oh, screw this guy. 
[00:52:00]  Tom already left from Glen Burnie.  I think Tom from Glen Burnie is still listening to us.  Yeah, I hope he's rotting with cancer, too.  I hated Tom.  Turn the radio off.  I'm too weak to get out of bed.  Go drink your Beamish then, Bob.  All right.  So why don't we get Becky back in here?  Look, it's all scratched up from her teeth on the top.  I see that.  Look at it.  It's all dented.  Yum, yum.  Yum, yum.  Yum, yum.  Hey, why don't we get the girl from Philly in here, too? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, let's see what she's all about.  How about a cheese dog?  How about a fish, a perch or something?  You know what?  How about New England clam chowder?  Wow.  Look at those sunglasses there.  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  Good.  You're scaring us.  Why the sunglasses?  I don't know.  I just got off the subway, and I just got here like five seconds ago.  I haven't changed into my sexy outfit yet, so.  You look like you should be in like a Marilyn Manson video or something.  She got like a starlet look to her.  Yeah.  Thank you.  She's all Hollywooded out and stuff.  I used to live there.  You did, did you?  Mm-hmm.  What did you do in Hollywood? 
[00:53:00]  I was acting and living the Hollywood lifestyle.  Okay, what did you act in?  Yeah, here we go.  I was a lead extra in Bedazzled and Coyote Ugly.  In Bedazzled?  In The Wedding Planner and Little Nicky.  Who were you in Bedazzled?  I was the person that caught Brendan Fraser's junk when he jumped off the stage.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  And what about Little Nicky?  Little Nicky, I was in the basketball sequence.  You were, weren't you?  I hadn't actually seen that movie, though.  I heard it was really bad, so. 
[00:53:30]  What name do you go by in Hollywood there?  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Are you in the Internet Movie Database?  No.  I'm an extra.  Were you inside?  I'm sorry, Rick.  I didn't know you knew so much about Hollywood.  She's an extra.  She wouldn't be on there.  Rick knows.  Rick tried to go that route, didn't you, Rick?  Yeah.  Where's his headshots?  Did you take headshots, Rick?  We need those immediately.  We need them immediately for the website.  Well, what, where's the sexy outfit?  Oh, I'm wearing underneath of this.  Nice.  Oh, there we go.  Yeah.  I just got here as a photo. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  So you're going to be a tease.  My dream is to one day be like you guys.  I'm a radio person.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, I thought you were going to say you said you had a positive failure.  You tool.  I will one day have the crudest radio show in the country.  Really?  Yes.  And then they'll fire you and you can team up with Bob Buckman over at the Cube.  I want Norton when he's 85.  It's a one-city joke, people.  Very nice.  And we don't do anything for New York. 
[00:54:30]  Shut up.  Well, that's great.  Yeah, it's pretty easy to get into radio.  All you do is you buy some tin-knocking tools.  Anthony, I must say.  Yeah.  She seems a bit on the wild side.  And quite frankly, what you've come up with for the 55-gallon drum challenge kind of sucks.  We thought it was a little weak as far as...  Look at what she's going to do.  Even the Sunday?  Oh, wait.  What was the Sunday?  What's the Sunday?  No, what's the Sunday?  Rick.  Well, after yesterday, and I saw how this heartens you were as you were going after you were, 
[00:55:00]  oh, that pretzel girl's comment.  I love that.  So I decided I'd, you know, sit for five minutes, get my little brain working.  Think it out.  And I decided that I was going to do, you remember the slip and slide when you were little chaps?  Oh, yeah.  Right out of the booth, yeah.  Right.  I was going to get garbage bags the full length of the studio, take two gallons of ice cream,  pour it on the whole thing, whipped cream, syrup, cherries, and topless, half-maked, slip and slide across the studio. 
[00:55:30]  Now that's an idea.  And at the end, do a pretzel.  Then I'd be a chocolate-covered pretzel.  Why didn't we just get a slip and slide?  I like it.  Well, garbage bags are kind of good.  It adds a danger factor.  What's more appropriate for me, bud?  I just kind of wrap it all up.  All right, we're going to have to set up the studio for the slip and slide Sunday.  She could do it right down the hallway.  Right outside.  All right, why don't you get into your hot outfit?  Do you want to check out Becky from Brockton? 
[00:56:00]  She's going to eat the lamb eyes covered in chocolate.  I'll do both.  We don't have any more lamb eyes.  We do have a tongue.  We have a lamb tongue.  Do you want to make out with it?  Suck the chocolate off the lamb tongue?  That would be something for one to eat out of a balloon knot, wouldn't it?  Oh, chocolate-covered lamb tongue eating out of the balloon knot.  That's somebody's balloon knot.  We found it.  Yeah.  A little show prep while the show's happening.  You're taking the balloon knot there, Brockton?  If I do it in the hallway, you guys aren't going to be able to see it.  You do back door? 
[00:56:30]  I haven't yet.  You haven't yet?  I've been wanting to work up to it.  Opie, she's a virgin for the back door.  My boy's got a big member, so.  Oh, so it might hurt a little bit?  He's packing a gun?  Look at him.  Look at him.  God bless him.  Wow.  The size of your form.  Really?  Not as wide as my wrist.  As big as a Beamish can?  Almost.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  And he looks like he would because he's just got that, like, country look.  No, that's not the guy.  That's him, right?  He grew up in New Hampshire.  The let me for president guy is not her boyfriend? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Pay attention.  That's the guy.  Yeah, that's the guy.  I'm right, Greg.  I'm sorry.  God, I feel like it's...  Wow.  I'm in the moment here.  But didn't you say that he was just your friend?  Yeah, he's my friend and my sister.  Oh, see, I think we're both, eh?  We broke up a while ago, but we're still together.  Oh, yeah.  So you're friends, but you still have them.  Right.  You're a huge mule.  I think we're both right, Jim.  Seriously.  Yeah, you guys are both right.  It's like, I don't think...  Don't fight over it.  Yeah.  We're quarreling.  Well, hopefully someday you'll work up to that and give him that little treat. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, he wants me to do it desperately.  Yeah?  He'll be, like, every day.  No wonder, would you like to see his member?  No, not just as, like, a member.  He's got a tattoo on it.  What?  He did it himself.  He tattooed a cross on it when it was really, really, really drunk.  Oh, my God.  He's from the whole lot.  She said when it's not hot.  Yeah.  Yeah, she knows the terminology.  Very good.  All right.  I wasn't sure with the Boston accent, eh?  Sorry.  So once it's all ready to go, then it's a cross, but it's just, it's merely a plus sign when...  Right. 
[00:58:00]  Where, where, not on the helmet?  Right at the top, right there.  On the helmet?  Underneath?  No, on the base.  On the bottom side?  On the top side.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, here.  On...  Right here.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  It's bad anywhere.  Bad, bad, bad.  He told me it was there.  Do it yourself.  There is a chance that you can infect your member and have to have it lopped off.  Well, he did get some responsibility in your life.  I'm just thinking, no, when it comes to that area, I don't care what he does with his, for 
[00:58:30]  God's sake, but, you know, you've got to take care of that area.  You don't want nothing happening to that.  You get your nose pierced, it gets infected, you go around with a wacky nostril for a while.  You do something down there and it gets infected?  Well, let's get a lemmy for president here.  You open for dice and you...  I have an 8-gauge.  Oh, God.  What, what?  Oh, I have an 8-gauge in my tongue.  It's twice the size of a normal tongue.  Really?  Yeah.  Stick out your tongue.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  Hey, look at that.  I got a 6-gauge ripped out of my head. 
[00:59:00]  I've had it for 20 years.  Ripped out of...  Wow.  Her ear is split.  Holy Jesus.  What happened?  Oh, wow.  I got in a fight.  You got in a fight.  There is a surprise.  A Brockton girl in the car.  What a surprise.  Brockton girl getting a little wrong.  Actually, I'm from Taunton.  I live right in between Taunton and Brockton.  Yeah?  I live right near Bridgewater.  What was the fight over?  His mule, right?  No.  No?  I don't even remember.  It was a long time ago.  You don't even remember the fight?  That was the night before I got in my car accident.  I was on, like, 20-close.  Yeah, she was the girl that...  Oh, so you're doing Klonopin.  Yeah, she crushed the car into the pole. 
[00:59:30]  And you got in a fight with a chick.  She ripped your earring out of your ear.  Yeah.  And it just split.  Holy Jesus.  She's got two earlobes on her left side.  That's pretty cool.  I know.  When I talk, when I chew, it opens and closes.  It looks like Pac-Man.  Yeah, if I take my top earring out, it looks like Pac-Man.  People are grossed out by eating.  I'm that hungry when I'm eating.  Oh, really?  You don't like watching it move?  Freak them out with a bag.  Hey, big schlong guy.  Unless she's eating your mule, right?  Then you don't care about that little ear. 
[01:00:00]  We got a lemmy for president in the studio now, Ant.  So you tattooed your thing.  What made you...  Get it right on that mic there.  What made you do that?  I don't know.  I was giving my friend a tattoo.  On his?  No.  So you just decided...  Was your friend there when you did it?  Yeah, then he thought he could do it to himself.  And he got about one dot on that.  Dude, I got to say,  it's kind of a little homoeroticism going on 
[01:00:30]  when you're watching each other tattooing your...  No, this kid used to pose naked on my couch  and show us his stuff, like, constantly.  Not him.  But that is a little homoeroticism.  After they're tattooing each other's junk,  what do you do?  Watch Olympic stuff?  Two guys tattooing their junk.  Why not?  Pat on the back.  Job well done.  Hey, just doing this to wet it.  Make sure it's not infected.  You know, saliva will disinfect.  Thank you, just being a pal. 
[01:01:00]  All right, well, big schlong guy.  Hey, there you go.  Big schlong guy, tattooed guy,  cross plus minus guy.  All right.  So I think it's time for Becky to eat the sheep eyes.  Yeah, let's get right down to this now.  Rick, if you would present her with the...  Can I get a drink?  What kind of drink?  Anything.  Well, not beer.  I don't want to drink anything.  No, no.  How old are you?  I'm 19.  She's 19 years old.  She's got some excesses for you. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, better to have drugs.  It's illegal to give you alcohol.  You have a bucket.  A bucket.  Oh, they have nuts on them.  Yeah, it's chocolate covered.  Frenchie did that.  I got a deal of meat.  It's wonderful.  Why don't we go to Frenchie?  He makes this bare beef.  Hold on, Ann.  Is this the tongue?  Why don't we go to Frenchie?  He makes this stuff taste good all the time.  I know.  It is a downside of it.  We've got to chew the...  Okay, how come one is bigger than the other?  Um, I don't know.  Look at this size difference.  Little fella.  I think one's just got a little more chocolate on it. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, well, the poor little fella had eye cancer.  It's kind of frightening, but I don't know what they look like.  It was Bud Freeman.  He wore a monocle.  You should have seen him when he was still alive.  I have to eat both of them.  Oh, my gosh.  I'm a lamb.  I'm a lamb.  I'm a lamb.  I'm a lamb.  Hold on.  Let's keep it up to you.  You don't have to eat the tongue.  Okay.  Oh, I just get chewed on it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.  God damn.  Bring them off.  Hey, I'm standing next to you.  I'm not like...  Hey, so wait a minute. 
[01:02:30]  You just got juice from the eye?  From the tongue.  The tongue juice dripped on you?  I tried to break it open.  This is pretty heinous.  You can't break a tongue.  I didn't know.  That's going in the balloon on anyway, right?  Right.  We got to save that one.  Get a good one.  Look at it.  It looks like it's supposed to be in a balloon now.  Yeah, perfect.  Okay, here she goes.  She has got an eyeball, chocolate-covered, nut-covered eyeball in her hand.  She bites it in half, right?  Class, you have to chew this.  I have to eat both of them?  Yeah.  This one's so much bigger. 
[01:03:00]  That's okay.  You can bite it in half.  Oh, I see a piece of flesh.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Yeah.  Let's go.  All right.  I have to bite it in half.  There we go.  Suck it.  Oh, God.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Oh, God.  I can't take that.  Let me see.  Let's see now.  Chew, chew, chew.  Chew, chew, chew.  Oh, God damn it.  It's just disgusting.  It's not bad.  You have to eat the other half of the little fella's eye.  How did that taste?  It's like black inside. 
[01:03:30]  How did that taste?  How did that taste?  It doesn't really taste like anything.  It's just like super, super chewy.  That's fine.  People, it's not going to hurt you.  What do you have to eat the other half?  No, it really doesn't taste like anything.  It's just like mushrooms don't taste anything, like anything, but they still gross me out.  Yeah, but you don't see out of mushrooms.  Go ahead, eat that half.  It does kind of look like a mushroom, doesn't it?  You don't see out of mushrooms.  There you go.  Hey.  Oh, you hear a crackling?  That piece is a little rougher, huh?  She's a really cool chick. 
[01:04:00]  Just think those eyeballs at some point were looking at the little farm.  Oh, she's gagging.  She's gagging.  Just make sure, the pail is right there.  That's why I had the pail.  You were gagging.  She's fine.  I have a bad gag reflex because my tongue went.  Wow, that's weird.  You could put a bottle of a can of Beamish in your mouth and you have a gag reflex.  I have a piece of eye stuck in my tooth.  Hey, big junk guy, she's got a gag reflex?  Does she have a gag on you?  I used to take a lot of pills at once.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  All right, I have to eat this last piece.  Oh, yeah.  So you're almost there. 
[01:04:30]  At one time, that eyeball was staring at another goat's ass.  At one time, this eyeball was staring at the person who killed me and said, please don't  kill me.  Yeah.  Somebody will eat my eyes.  Never thinking this eyeball was going to be chocolate covered and eaten.  There's not enough chocolate.  Oh, gosh.  Because you're trying to find more chocolate to dilute the chewy taste of the lamb eye.  This chocolate is really good, by the way.  Yeah, thank you, Frenchie.  Yeah, stupid Frenchie.  God damn it, he makes him...  He cooks too good.  Yeah.  No, she's having problems.  I have prepared, dude. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, look at that gag.  Oh, you're gagging?  Oh, she's gagging.  I'll tell you right now.  Hey, move your coat.  She's gone.  She's having a tough time.  Because the ball in my tongue went so big, it's a brand new one.  I'll tell you right now.  And I keep having trouble.  Becky from Brockton, if you puke, you are in, by the way.  You're still in.  You have to puke in the thing, though.  Oh, thank you.  You have some eyeball.  You have some eyeball on it.  Was there any juice?  No.  No eyeball juice?  Okay.  Almost like if clams were chewier than they are and didn't taste like clams, they don't 
[01:05:30]  taste like anything.  All right, one down, one to go there.  I don't know if I can eat that.  Hey, you're doing good.  It's an eyeball.  Get a good one.  It's, like, really hard to chew.  It's all right.  Take a nice, big bite.  This is the big eyeball.  She went with the skull.  How can they have two oversized eyeballs?  Maybe one was a bigger sheep than the other one.  Yeah.  There's a baby.  Yeah.  Maybe one is the brown eye.  Oh, Jesus.  That might be another type of ball.  Is it that you guys are in a way?  No, no.  I thought you said one lamb, one human eyeball. 
[01:06:00]  All right, she's taking a big bite.  She had to tug the retina out of that one.  Oh, no.  Come on.  What?  No, I didn't spit it out.  I like the chocolate, but look at that.  Let me say, wait a minute.  She had to pull the eyeball apart with her teeth.  That is so gross.  I can't do that.  You can't.  It's a big, meaty, red, bulbous, bald thing.  What did Frenchie do to us, man?  That is not an eyeball.  Come on.  You've got to just take the bite and chew it. 
[01:06:30]  You already did.  These eyeballs are completely different.  You know what?  No, see that meaty piece hanging out?  If you just bite that.  That won't come off.  You know what?  Bite it in half and spit it out.  You don't have to eat it, but just bite it off of there.  I want to see you bite that in half.  Don't look at it.  No, I'm not.  It's not worth me out now that I see it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  She's got the eyeball.  Ah, stop.  Damn it.  She has to pull the eyeball apart with her teeth.  I know.  I know.  She's like ripping her.  It's like real meat, kind of.  It's eyeball meat.  I think Frenchie tricked us. 
[01:07:00]  These eyeballs are completely different.  That's not an eyeball.  Frenchie's on the line.  Okay, let me take this chocolate off it.  Hey, Frenchie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What was the eyeballs?  What do you think about those eyeballs?  How come one was bigger than the other and it was a little more meaty?  Well, because, you know, in the first one I cleaned it and I cleaned it too much.  I took too much of the fat around it.  Ah, there was fat around the eye.  Yes.  So this...  It was a whole head, you know what I mean? 
[01:07:30]  I had to boil the head.  Oh, so you boiled the lamb's head.  Yeah.  And then you took one eyeball and cleaned all the fat and muscle off of it.  And there was nothing left.  Yes, exactly.  So then the second one, you just kind of gouged it out of the eye socket with the meat and fat  around it.  Exactly.  And everything.  And put luscious chocolate coating.  Beautiful.  The chocolate was good, Frenchie.  Thank you.  She's eating eyeball fat.  Eyeball fat.  I hope that doesn't go to my butt.  Oh, we have the tongue coated with chocolate.  And I believe that would be going in a girl's balloon knot on Monday and being eaten out 
[01:08:00]  by our girlfriend.  Eye, eye, eye.  But it's going to be good.  You see, she's not going to be able to eat the tongue.  Because it's going to be really tough.  But let us fight anyway.  You know?  All right.  So, if she can't chew it, she can...  Suck it!  That's right.  All right, Frenchie, we're going to let you go.  We don't want to burn you out.  No, no.  All right?  Yep.  All right, there you go.  It's Frenchie.  There you go.  Au revoir!  All right, what do you think?  Should Becky have one more bite? 
[01:08:30]  What?  Of the fat eyeball?  Yeah.  The fatty eyeball?  One more bite.  I would say one more chewed, swallowed bite.  Yeah, one more chewed, swallowed, and you're in.  No, you shut your mouth.  No, they wanted to eat both.  One more chewed, swallowed, and you're in.  They wanted you to eat both.  Yeah, we actually wanted you to finish it.  Because now we know that it's like the flesh.  Now we know what it is.  It's the fleshy head of the lamb, fat and meat.  Somewhere in the middle of that flesh is the actual eyeball.  Yeah.  That's like a lot of the sweat ducks.  I'm trying to see if I'll be able to bite this piece.  Just make believe it's about ten times bigger and just pretend it's his junk.  I'm not going to be able to chew half of this.  How much it bites it in half and gets to the eyeball? 
[01:09:00]  I can see part of the eyeball.  You can probably see part of the eyeball through the flesh.  The fleshy, fat.  It looks like black mushrooms.  Of the eye sockets.  It looks like black mushroom?  Yeah.  And we know how you don't like mushrooms.  Would it be more comfortable if we tattooed a cross on it?  All right, Becky.  This is for a spot in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Uh-oh.  God, do you hear it? 
[01:09:30]  It's making that gushy sound.  She's doing good.  She'll finish it.  Oh, she's chewing.  She's chewing.  Oh, she's gagging.  She's gagging a little bit.  All that fatty eye.  That ligament and cartilage off the little lamb's head.  Oh, that is such a lamb fat.  Gouged out with a big knife and, yeah.  She got it.  Was that good?  It wasn't too bad.  It didn't really taste like anything at all.  No.  It's really super, super chewy.  It's not about the taste.  It's not about the taste.  It's about how sick it is.  It's totally the texture, Derek. 
[01:10:00]  And it's about the psychological thing that you're eating a goddamn eyeball.  Well, sinewy, neat.  Ugh.  All right.  Grainy and mealy.  I think she qualifies it.  It wasn't mealy, but...  You are...  It was like eating elastics.  Ugh.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who's the last?  Nice.  Wow.  All right.  You are our first contestant.  Confirmed.  Signed, sealed, delivered.  You are in.  Thank you. 
[01:10:30]  Super.  Very good.  Becky from Brockton.  We'll be joining us for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Give her a big kiss now.  I'm talking to Norton.  Oh.  No, I'm kidding.  Come on.  Get away from me.  All right.  We've got to get to us.  Norton, I still got some eye-sucking.  I couldn't follow that mule anyway.  I would never want to die.  Yeah, that sucks.  If you've seen that, what am I going to do?  Like throwing a crowbar down an empty hallway.  Can I just say one thing?  Sure.  You guys should go to BledForLife.com.  It's my friend's band.  Oh, a band plug. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  She delivered the goods.  Yeah, we don't mind a band plug.  They're a really good band.  They're like heavy metal.  BledForNumber or BledForLetters?  BledForLife.com.  BledForLife.com.  Nice.  Nice name.  All right.  Well, the band's name is Bled, but their website is BledForLife.  Gotcha.  Cool.  All right.  All right.  And those are friends of yours?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Let's prepare a slip and slide Sunday girls.  Oh, yeah.  This I've got to see.  How much time are you going to need?  Not even 10 minutes.  All right.  Quick break in slip and slide Sunday girls.  Next hit. 
[01:11:30]  Very good.  They're going to try to impress us to get in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We're looking for more ladies to call us up and tell us what they would do to get in  on the contest.  Okay?  All right.  What do you want to do?  Going into break here.  F.U. line again?  Sure.  Sure, F.U. line.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the opiate Anthony.  F.U. line.  I want to say F.U.  To the retarded guy I work with.  Hey, man.  When I'm in a can taking a leak and you call my name and I answer you, that doesn't mean 
[01:12:00]  I'm inviting you in to come in and get a gander at my junk.  Now I've got to hold my friggin' foot against the door to use the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  F.U. to my boss for the broken door locks while I'm at it.  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, there's some big F.U. to Gordon Gunn's Blind Ass, the owner of the Cavaliers.  You got us a new arena, but we're sick and tired of losing.  Your blind ass needs to sell the team.  We want a f.U. winning team already.  God, get someone else who f.U. cares.  Next message. 
[01:12:30]  Big F.U. to my girlfriend Whitney.  Thanks for getting us evicted because of your animals.  Your dog, your cat, your fish, your bird, your other rodents and f.U. have.  Now I've got to worry about moving out.  They're in the middle of the f.U. school year.  Thanks, bitch.  End of message.

[01:13:00]  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including D.C. today.  866-3774.  Wow.  Becky has joined the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes.  The first contestant.  She ate chocolate-covered lamb eyeballs.  I think we want a total of like seven girls.  Six spots remain. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  We got a slip and slide Sunday thing happening.  We're setting up for that.  It's Carrie from Philly.  I'm not feeling it with Carrie.  I don't know.  No?  You think this is going to put her over the top?  It's kind of cool, the whole half-naked sliding and all kinds of crap thing.  I think that's cool.  But it's cute, it's cute crap.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  You know what I mean?  We should get a restaurant to empty their dumpster for us.  And bring it up here.  Something like that.  I think it's a little too cute.  A little too cutesy.  Well, it's fitting in with the theme, though, of stuff that will be covered with junk and garbage and maybe syrup.  Might be something we'd throw in the barrel.  I don't know.  I'll have to see it.  All right.  We might pull it off at the execution. 
[01:14:30]  Paul, the chef, wants in real fast.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  If you guys are going to do the hot dog thing, you've got to remember that you've got different kinds of asses.  Like she said, she likes mustard.  That'll hurt her.  The girl that got it in the balloon knot, that's deep fit.  It's going to sting.  So that job won't be accomplished.  That adds to it, actually.  One girl screaming, the other girl doing what she has to do.  Yeah, actually.  I like it a lot. 
[01:15:00]  Can I say one more thing?  Norton, I've got tickets for you, brother.  I made my wife go through hell to get it.  Where are you going?  Huh?  To your 8 o'clock show here in Cleveland.  Oh, you're in Cleveland.  Thanks, Paul.  Oh, you got it, baby, man.  Can't wait for it, man.  There is actually an 11 o'clock on sale there, too, which is almost sold.  So if you want to go, 11 o'clock on April this fall.  Thanks, buddy.  I'll be there at 8.  I'm the guy that looks like Triple H, screaming for you for an autograph, brother.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  Later on.  Look at this Aussie ad.  This is so cool, man.  Yeah, for the Aussie show. 
[01:15:30]  The Aussie boy, March 5th.  Jim, speaking of your shows, you're playing Town Hall April 18th in New York City.  Yeah, somebody yelled at me because I don't think I've ever given out the Ticketmaster number.  Can I just do that real quick?  It's April 18th.  Righty?  212.  I know numbers are bad on the air, but 307-7171.  All right.  I'm so happy that I'm hearing a lot of commercials for your Town Hall gig.  Yeah, no, they're doing a good job with that.  They're playing them on a station in Tampa in case anybody's coming up for a birthday.  There are so many douchebags that take advantage of the O.P. and Anthony show, and I'm going 
[01:16:00]  to start calling out people very soon, man.  They bought one 10-second spot because they assumed we'll just sell out your shows for you.  And there's been very little plug-in.  Where's the love?  Why don't you help us out, man?  We need freaking advertising dollars.  Well, we have the person responsible on the phone.  Hello?  Oh, who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  I hear you'll hear one 10-second spot for your New York City gig sometime next week. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's no reason to advertise it.  Who cares if people show up?  There's a lot of people that assume way too much with us because we've been way too nice.  Let people know you're not talking about me, so don't blame me.  No.  Don't blame me.  No, not at all.  We'd like to see you do good, but it would be nice, you know, throw a couple bucks around.  Yep.  You know, help the guy out a little bit.  Yeah, they just assume that I'm just going to talk about it for four hours a day.  Right, right. 
[01:17:00]  Nothing else to talk about.  Sure.  God.  These people.  Don't get him aggravated, though.  Don't remind him too much.  I like when he loses his mind, though.  I can't tell you what the foul mood I have been in all week.  Really?  Why the foul mood?  I've bitten my cell phone a few times.  I've actually bitten it because I know I'm going to throw it and break it, and I need  that for box gathering, so there's no reason to break my...  I'm really...  For box.  All right.  Laurie, what's going on? 
[01:17:30]  Hello.  Hey, how are you?  I just was wondering if anybody else saw the Rosie O'Dowell show today.  I know you're going to mock me for watching it, but...  No, no, no.  I'm not going to mock you, and I'll tell you why.  I hope he was doing crafts along with Rosie.  Yeah, I just got a shower.  I flicked it on.  No, a lot of...  The email exploded before the show.  You're about to mention that some girl at the end of the show flashed or something?  It was.  I flicked it on, and I don't even know who was on, and then all of a sudden they went  to the audience before they went to a commercial, and the girl just whipped up her top and 
[01:18:00]  showed her boobs.  Hey, how about that?  Were they naked boobs or just a bra?  No, naked boobs.  Wow.  I thought that show was taped.  You know, I don't...  I think sometimes it's live.  No, I don't think it's tape.  I really don't know, because I guess if it was taped, they would have...  Somebody would have saw it, but I don't, you know...  I don't think it's taped.  Huh?  I think it is live.  I don't know how...  I guess she looks like she's on her 30s or so.  You're trying to...  So you're saying that this girl definitely flashed her boobs?  Oh, yeah.  I definitely saw it.  Do you remember when we went to the meeting there at...  Where the hell were we?  Telepictures.  But she didn't have a wow sign or anything. 
[01:18:30]  No, no.  I'm talking about the one where the audience from Rosie was coming out.  Remember that day?  Oh, that was for the XFL.  Oh, jeez.  No wonder I forgot about it.  But, yeah, we were going into the building, and they were letting out Rosie's audience.  Oh!  Where the hell is Jason Williams when you need him?  Prompt him in front of that friggin' audience.  So was the girl hot at least, or no?  You know, it was just like a five-second thing.  They just, you know... 
[01:19:00]  I think she had, like, dark hair.  She looked like she was, like, in her 30s.  Yeah.  But she looked up her top, but she didn't have a sign or anything.  And I'm sure it was related to your show.  That's why she did it.  Was she a cutie patootie?  Was she a cutie patootie?  Yeah, I like that cutie patootie thing.  Oh, it's adorable.  I think it's going to catch on.  Yeah, it just makes you want to tussle a fat girl's mullet.  Oh, jeez.  Hey, Laurie, thanks for telling us about that.  Okay.  Love your show, guys.  Thank you.  By the way, Becky from Brockton, her pictures are up on OPNAnthony.com. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, they are already?  Yes.  We work fast around here.  Greg, what's up?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, I just wanted to let you guys know, I saw Rosie O'Donnell this afternoon out of Delhi,  downtown, and she had the most ugliest girl with her.  So I don't care what these rumors are.  This girl is gay all the way.  Well, the...  Well, huh.  What do you mean about the rumors?  She's not really going there, but she's not really...  Oh, she was...  She's not really...  Guys, can I ask you a question?  You guys...  She's not really fighting the rumor anymore.  Yeah.  You guys play State of Emergency on PS2, right?  Ah, we tried it out. 
[01:20:00]  You guys got to try Halo on Xbox, man.  It's the best game ever.  Halo?  Halo's good.  We were playing that in the back.  Halo in this new game called Reckless.  It's a thriving game.  Killing Earl.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're awesome.  I know you guys aren't into Xbox yet, but I'm telling you, it's awesome.  I'm waiting for the Jason Williams version of Grand Theft Auto 3.  Yeah, actually, no...  That's going to be fun.  No, GTA 3's coming out on Xbox in like six months.  I read it yesterday.  All right.  So, it's going to be pretty cool.  Yo, you guys suck, all right?  Thanks, Greg.  Take care.  All right.  Yeah, a lot of people are not feeling the slip and slide trick.  Elliot.  Yeah.  What's up?  Yo, you should put some puke down on that. 
[01:20:30]  Put them by the stuff.  The ice cream is so good.  Some puke, huh?  Yeah, dude.  That's more like a porno or something like that.  That's not like...  Yeah, it's true.  It's about a gallon drum.  Would it be wrong if somebody went duty in the ice cream and she slipped through the ass?  Yeah, get something like that down.  Some cat litter or something like that.  But it's goopy stuff that's going to be on our body, no?  No, no, no.  We are getting laid.  We would never accept this trick in the world.  You guys can't go down that road.  All right. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hello?  Uh, Rick.  What's the matter, Rick?  I'll tell you to tell you somebody on the phone.  No, it'll tell you to tell you somebody on the phone.  No, it'll tell you to tell you.  I'm like, what are you on, drugs?  Are you all right?  Are you people on dope?  Are you all right?  I'm taking stuff.  What are you on?  I'm just taking cold medicine.  Oh, is that what you're...  You're all fuzzy, aren't you?  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Look at him.  He's on the cold medicine.  I love cold medicine.  My head is swimming.  God damn...  When I take either Sudafed or I take NyQuil, NyQuil is the best goddamn...  And that DayQuil, what a joke that is.  I'm convinced the only difference between DayQuil and NyQuil is the color, period.  I'll say.  I'll say.  What, you think DayQuil is as strong as the NyQuil?  Absolutely.  Indeed.  I take it, and I get all fuzzy and...  It's such a nice morphine-like buzz. 
[01:22:00]  All right, Rick.  All right, can we get to...  So what do you guys want to do?  Oh, my God.  You're out.  This is high.  No, we got all this...  Rick is really high.  We got all this stuff set up now for...  I know.  Let's get her back in.  He put me in a headlock before I actually love you, man.  Ah.  We're going to embarrass ourselves.  We're going to embarrass ourselves.  Look.  Look.  How hot she looks.  She's very hot.  Come on.  Do you have a thong on, ma'am?  I don't wear underwear.  You don't?  I don't own any.  That's why yesterday when you told me to put on a bra and panty, I said I couldn't. 
[01:22:30]  You don't own underwear?  Mm-mm.  I just own bras.  I buy lots of Victoria's Secret bras.  What got you off of the panties?  I don't know.  I just don't feel...  Yeah?  What if you got to wear something real short?  I just don't feel it.  I just wear, like, little shorts underneath.  Hey, can we all take a look at your butt?  She didn't show me, even.  No.  Yeah, you liar.  I saw you on the floor.  I didn't see all of it.  I just saw it.  I'm so oblivious.  I didn't even realize he was, like, behind me, like...  Yeah.  Gary, you're beautiful.  You're from Philly.  We love Philly. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  But the listeners aren't feeling the bit yet.  They're kind of freaking out.  Yeah, they're like, eh, it's not really...  I'm going to be, like, half naked.  They kind of like the fact that you're going to be half naked because we'll show the pics.  They definitely weren't feeling the pretzel thing, so they're almost there.  We need to spice it up just a little bit.  How come she's not doing the yellow treats?  Well, I know.  Can't see you anymore.  All right.  You know something?  I like the idea, but the...  May I, before you finish it, may I say absolutely? 
[01:23:30]  Go ahead.  I apologize.  Wow.  Hey.  We were dumped out of that.  They don't allow...  I'm very sorry.  Yeah, what you were saying is administer the delicious yellow treats, yellow discipline, we'd call it.  Just call it yellow discipline.  Yellow discipline.  Right into Norton's mouth.  Offering me a fine, warm, popcorn-flavored treat.  Salty, yet less in teaching.  How do you feel? 
[01:24:00]  Learned my lesson.  Well, the garbage bags are out there.  Yeah, and we have four or five different kinds of ice cream and lots of whipped cream.  That's all I mean, to keep any wetness off of them.  I'll tell you right now, if you were ugly, you would be so gone by now.  Yeah, it's a testament to you.  Yeah, we're working with you here.  We're working with you.  Yeah, you're a very attractive little lady.  Thank you.  You have a friend?  Do you have a friend?  No, I have friends.  Do you just date different guys?  And girls.  And girls. 
[01:24:30]  See, my whole theory on friendship is when I meet a friend, you screw them right off the bat.  That way there's no sexual tension.  You're right, pal.  All right.  I think she should be in the Pits by Gowl and Jump Shop.  That's a great philosophy.  It works, though.  Roll it up, Ann.  We don't even need to see...  And then you don't have to worry later on, oh, oh, my God, the sex, and it's going to ruin the friendship.  And you can see what they're all about, right?  Yeah, exactly.  And I'm definitely an equal opportunity employer.  Ah, so friends, girls, friends, guys, it doesn't matter. 
[01:25:00]  Although the rapid weight loss could hurt the friendship.  I'm a size two now.  Sorry, buddy.  Wow, Jim's saying it's definitely lame.  We've got a whole tough here, I think.  Jim?  Yeah?  What's up?  I think a good way to spice up the flip and fly is have Mr. Norton lick it off when she's done.  Well, that's if Norton wanted to be in the 55-gallon drum.  Yeah, that wouldn't be...  To be honest, what you'd do, believe me, she's really hot.  But that wouldn't be gross, because she's a hot girl with a yummy treat on her. 
[01:25:30]  Licking ice cream off a beautiful girl is not exactly a stretch.  There's not a guy out there that wouldn't do that.  We're going to work with Carrie here.  My best friend...  We'll figure something out.  My best friend was going to come in today, but I figured you couldn't fit two of us into  a 55-gallon drum, so she went to...  Oh, yes, she can.  Sometimes the legs have to be broken backwards.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  All right.  Now, make the flip and fly...  Huh?  Make the flip and fly really gross.  Just throw some pictures of Savita down on it. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, gosh.  And by the way, I heard she's going to be an actress, but she doesn't do her own lines,  so they just put peanut butter in her mouth, and I don't know.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't know what she looks like.  She was pretty like five, ten years ago, and then she...  Can I try something here?  Yeah.  You don't mind getting naked, right?  Mostly naked.  I don't like my hips.  What's wrong with your hips?  Let's take a look at your hips.  She doesn't want to show them.  No, she's right in the back.  She doesn't want to show them.  Move over near Jim. 
[01:26:30]  We've got the tight dress on.  Let's take a look at your hips through the dress here.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong with the hips?  They're fine.  How about the highest?  She's right pretty good.  Women don't know that hips like that are very, very...  I like glass figures.  All right.  Let's negotiate here.  So let's not even try too hard.  So, okay.  Those are birthed hips.  So what do you got?  You want to...  You want a little butter?  You want to keep panties on?  She doesn't have panties.  Oh, I don't believe her.  Oh, I see.  I see.  So if we roll down the top, because we'll do something topless? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, okay.  So she'll roll down the top and keep the bottom.  Right.  I'm thinking, you know, we maybe go out in the street with her.  And what?  Um...  Do you have an open mind?  I got something that will guarantee you, you'll get a spot on the 55-gallon drum channel.  Uh-oh.  This is frightening.  I'm going to hope he gets ideas.  Dump, dump, dump.  I'm just as frightened right now.  So, uh...  Let's hear it first.  We, uh...  We throw you in a dumpster. 
[01:27:30]  And they collect my body the next morning?  We throw you in, like, one of those messy restaurant dumpsters.  Dumpsters.  Wow.  And then your body comes out a few days later?  Hey, I love that car.  It's in my wife's name.  She kind of...  She kind of swishes around the dumpster for a little while.  We send Rick on the street with her, and you're in.  I could get, like, problems down...  Yeah, definitely.  There's tons of bacteria, and...  We'll duct tape the area.  Hmm.  What do you think, Ant? 
[01:28:00]  Well, I like it.  Rick with the phone.  Uh, we have someone call up that's close by with a really good dumpster.  We call it the, uh, the Boston Au Pair.  Uh, the Boston Nanny competition.  Only, uh, you get to keep your legs.  You ever hear about her up in Boston?  Yeah, that was a good one.  Sexy, right?  What a lot.  Boy, no one knows, uh, who did that.  What do you think?  Work with us, Carrie.  What do you think?  I am working with you.  I came all the way down here. 
[01:28:30]  Did you come from Philly?  It took me a long time, and the last money I have until Monday.  Ah, restaurant.  So, you know...  Restaurant dumpster for a little roll.  You roll around a little bit.  Yes, Ben?  It's a nasty dumpster that Red Eye Grill uses with.  It just smells like seafood.  It's down our garage.  It's really bad.  You can't be thrown.  Remember, guys, I can, I also, like, can contort my body into...  Yeah, but that's kind of cold and cute.  Yeah, that'll be the encore. 
[01:29:00]  We're looking for...  See how disgusting it was, her eating the eyeballs?  It was like, ah, like we were all like, ugh.  We need the ugh factor.  I would have stuck that inside of me and then ate it instead of going into a dumpster.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Hmm.  That's potential.  That it does.  Chris is saying slip and slide reeks of Z100.  Oh, we don't need that.  How about I carve Opie and Anthony in my chest?  With what?  With a straight razor.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I like that a lot.  Oh, you a cutter? 
[01:29:30]  Used to be.  You used to be a cutter?  Oh, hey, we should go out.  This girl's got problems.  Oh, look at the Norton showing.  They're comparing, like, suicide shots.  Let me see yours.  Nice.  She went the right way, too.  Let me see.  Holy ass.  You weren't kidding.  Let me see that.  I love seeing that.  Nice.  There you go.  And cigarettes.  When I was young.  And cigarettes, like you used to put the...  You ever do the, you put your arm next to someone else's arm and drop a cigarette in  between and see who moves first?  No, I've seen that.  That's a good one.  That's fun.  And then, of course, there's the mumbly paper. 
[01:30:00]  I'm not afraid of pain.  I just don't like dumpsters.  Yeah?  I can do that, too, with the cigarettes.  All right.  Here's a girl.  I'm not afraid...  Can we put a cigarette out on the...  Can we put a cigarette out on the...  What other show are you going to hear that on, by the way, folks?  Yeah.  I'm not afraid of pain.  I just don't like dumpsters.  Hey, how about Opie put a cigarette out on my tongue?  Wow.  Hey, Jesus.  I'll go for that.  I'll go for that.  Wow.  Opie, you want to put a cigarette out on my tongue?  Yeah.  Okay.  There we go.  That's pretty good.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Okay.  She just shocked all of us.  Have you done this before? 
[01:30:30]  No, never.  Remember, remember, I sit at home at night thinking of stuff from my radio show.  While he does that, how about Stinkies in your balloon not yelling,  Ready for love!  Ready for love!  Don't call me Jim no more.  Officer, call me.  I have cigarettes, too.  Ready for love!  Could you take a peek at the dumpster, at least?  I like the dumpster idea.  Cigarette on the tongue.  That's much better for radio.  You can't smell.  There's no smell-o-vision with radio.  No, the concept is great, though, of the dumpster. 
[01:31:00]  Is there a trick to the cigarette on the tongue thing?  Could be a lot of saliva.  Especially if she screams.  I don't know.  And I wouldn't do it if I were you all.  I'd let her do it herself.  How about I do it to myself, then?  Yeah, because that's another thing.  Because there might be, like, legalities.  Yeah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Blah.  What if you jump into a dumpster and fall on a nail?  I mean, you're sure it's sexy and funny, but...  Yeah, you never know.  There might be one of those...  Right, because we really don't know what's actually in that dumpster, you know? 
[01:31:30]  Can lid or something.  Yeah, that's really dangerous.  But a lot of girls have them call and say, I'll do anything.  There you go.  We want to make the dumpster thing happen.  But I think the cigarette trick is good.  I've been trying for years to try and get the smoke to go out of me, but I haven't worked  it out yet.  Have you tried it?  I've been trying, but I can't figure out, like, the concept behind it.  We had a girl do that.  We had a girl.  It was great.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Yeah.  You know what would be a good way to do it?  She smoked right out of there.  Can you do a headstand?  No.  If you can hold a cigarette and somehow try to put that out with yellow discipline. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, my God.  That's like some sort of circus act.  Jeez, man.  You don't like me, right?  Jeez.  I have such a rod sitting next to her.  She's terrific.  I think Ned Flanders dumped out of that.  Okay, how about...  Ned Flanders.  How about I get into a half-naked pretzel and then put a cigarette out on my tongue,  like, try to do it with, like, my toes?  Lost from Newark, I think, has a little take on that that I think is a little better. 
[01:32:30]  We have cigars in the back.  If you do it with a cigar, that you can't just, like...  You've got to kind of gnaw and douse it with spit and put it out.  You know what I mean?  How about a mouthful of jet fuel?  That, too.  What do you think?  Cigar?  Big, nasty cigar?  Put it out with your mouth somehow?  We could try it, but I don't know how dangerous that might be, like...  Well, we'll work up a lot of spit.  I think this cigarette's pretty impressive. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Cigar, man.  Then can we just burn you with it on your side?  Yeah, laugh.  Why do you hate women?  Wukaki.  I don't hate women.  We love women.  I love women.  We just don't show it on our show for some reason.  All right.  All right.  We're going to do the cigarette trick, then.  That's pretty impressive.  Should I go grab one right now?  Get the cigarette, get naked.  We'll take a break, and we'll qualify you next for the Fitzfighter Gowt and Jump Challenge.  What happened?  Oh, nice tattoo.  What do you got?  It's like...  It's a...  What is that called? 
[01:33:30]  What is it?  A griffin?  It's a flying squirrel thing.  It's a flying...  It's a flying lion eagle thing.  It's a parrot.  That's a lion?  It's a parrot.  It's called a parrot.  I know what that is.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Oh, look at you.  Do you get that sting?  I've seen those.  Name dropping.  Those creatures...  I am not.  I've killed many of them.  All right, why don't we... 
[01:34:00]  Carrie from Philly is going to set up for her a little cigarette trick, okay?  I can't wait.  Put her in a dumpster and light it on fire.  Mark from Philly.  Very good.  All right.  Michael, what's going on?  Yeah, how's it going?  Hey.  Yeah, I was just going to say that...  I don't know if you've seen the latest Mad Magazine issue.  That there's an article on how the NASA can improve on the male demographic.  So they have pictures that are used like Super Miles as astronauts. 
[01:34:30]  But one of them has a bunch of bumper stickers on the rocket ship.  And one of them has a WOW sticker with like O&A and 102.7 on it.  Wow.  Oh, yeah?  We have a fan at Mad Magazine.  I think we got a fan at Mad Magazine, which is, I think, the coolest goddamn thing ever.  Ever.  The guys from Mad Magazine, bravo.  What issue?  It's this issue.  It just came out last week.  No, what's the date on it?  I'm going to go out and get it right now.  Yeah, you think it's probably April, because usually like a month ahead. 
[01:35:00]  Hey, who's on the cover?  No, no.  They usually have the same guy on every cover.  Of course.  It's like the Oprah Magazine.  Mr. Obvious.  Michael.  There is a real genius to Mad Magazine.  Well, I love Mad Magazine.  Genius, too.  Hey, I'm quite flattered today.  We're all quite flattered.  Until the spanking magazines caught my attention by the time I was five, I was watching...  No, I would read Mad Magazine all the time.  It's an honor. 
[01:35:30]  They would make the chicks look really hot when they would parody movies and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember the Poseidon Adventure.  The Poopside Down Adventure.  Right.  Remember that?  Poopside Down Adventure.  Well, how about a crock of, that said blip over S now instead of apocalypse now?  A crock of S now.  Hey, Michael, thanks for turning us on to that, man.  A crock work lemon.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, the Rosie O'Donnell Show, they usually show a repeat of it at 5 o'clock on New York 55.  Well, they'll cut it out.  Yeah, they'll cut that out, I'm sure.  Oh, well, you'll know when we'll see something happening. 
[01:36:00]  You'll tell if they'll have to cut short, just to confirm it.  They're saying someone flashed at the end of Rosie today.  That's pretty damn cool.  All right, Michael.  All right, see ya.  Oh, Mike?  Right now he's going, huh?  What?  Do you remember the little square record in the Mad Magazine, Starchy Bunker Hill, which  was a goof on All in the Family?  There was that one?  Yeah.  Making Out?  Yeah.  There were little square things you put on your record player. 
[01:36:30]  Spy vs. Spy?  Yeah.  All that fun stuff.  Everyone's making out but me.  You remember that one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  Mad Magazine.  I really don't remember that.  I'm honored.  Someone could play for us over the phone, I guarantee.  Someone go out and get that.  All right, cool.  I want to see that.  So why don't we take a break?  Carrie from Philly's going to put out a cigarette on her tongue, naked, and she's going to be  on the skin.  He's a sick F. He wants to make out with Sandy Cain's tooto.  Stop it.  When's he doing that? 
[01:37:00]  In about an hour.  No way!  Yeah, I swear to God.  Where's Sandy Cain?  Doing something like that is highly contagious.  The guy does not...  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  He will nibble on it.  He'll bite it.  He'll...  Hey, wait a minute.  I'm going to puke.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  He's going to...  He's going to...  Yeah.  You're kidding.  He's going to lap it up.  He'll do whatever we want.  You're kidding.  He will do whatever we want to tooto.  And that's going to happen in the 6 o'clock hour today. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, my God.  And Michael Weiss is checking in today at 5.30.  The inspiration for Dice on Ice.  That's right.  Tell you the truth.  All right, lots of show to do.  Stay there.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's a squid.  It's a big squid, too.  It's a big squid.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Blister's not feeling the cigarette trick now, eh? 
[01:38:00]  I know.  Yeah.  Although...  We might have a line on a dumpster.  Hello?  We might have a line on some dumpster diving.  Yeah, Jeff, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey, bro, tell us.  I've seen people do the cigarette trick so many times.  You've got so much to live in your mouth.  As soon as you put the cigarette in there, that's it.  The cigarette goes out.  It don't hurt you.  Oh, bro.  It doesn't do anything to you.  Oh, true.  If you want to do something really, tell them to put the cigarette out with a balloon knot. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, boy.  That'd be something nice.  All right.  How about put it out on an ass cheek?  Thank you, Jeff.  Put it out on the balloon knot.  Or maybe start making gore with the balloon, you know?  You can't put it out there, Rick.  Let's go to Michael.  Michael, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  How you doing?  Oh, Michael with the radio voice.  What's up, Mike?  That sounds like Jim Florentine.  Come on, man.  Listen.  Guys.  Guys.  He was bashing us.  Hey, were you bashing us, Jim?  I was, and why would I do that? 
[01:39:00]  I'm like, I know.  All right.  Go ahead, Michael.  What's with this radio whore, man?  I mean, you know, she's talking about putting a cigarette out in her tongue.  I mean, it is easy.  Yeah.  You just pull up saliva in your tongue and you stick it out.  And you know something, Norton?  Yes, sir.  You're pathetic, man.  But now it's like you've got her tongue.  You're ridiculous.  I'm pathetic, and you use an up the thing so far I can taste that lime?  What are you talking about?  I was sitting here worshiping this girl, and she's name-dropping, and she's talking about  a radio show and everything else.  I don't care, sir.  When you're knee-deep in box, are you really thinking of any of that other drivel? 
[01:39:30]  There's some truth to that.  All right, Mike.  And Michael was just trying to keep it clean for the radio there, Jim.  Yeah, good job.  All right.  Well, the Dutchess thing is the way she should go, guys.  All right?  All right.  Thank you.  Talk to you.  Bye.  People are not happy with the cigarette out in her tongue thing.  Yeah.  By the way, props to Dan from Hoboken.  That hot-wired tape read is as smooth as Big Kev's bowel movements.  Oh, Jesus.  I am so glad someone noticed.  Hey, Mama.  Another one from New York today. 
[01:40:00]  That's two.  We're just doing a Caddyshack line.  Oh, nice.  What are you doing?  A little conversation going on?  Jim, we're doing a radio show.  What do you need, Jim?  Joe for everyone?  Oh.  He sent it out for coffee.  Someone's got to scout out a dumpster.  Yeah, we're setting it out.  Are you?  Yeah.  Get Carrie back in here.  Yeah, we have another girl that'll do the dumpster thing.  We can throw her in nude and stuff.  John?  You're saying you want to be better than last year. 
[01:40:30]  She's going to be dreaming about a dumpster.  She's going to be sitting in there trying to taste what a dumpster tastes like.  This cigarette thing just is a waste, man.  Why not?  There's no trip to it.  It's called pain management, Dick.  All right.  A lot of people say that it's an easy thing to do, though.  Yeah, I want to see them come in here and do it.  Pain management, Dick.  I don't know if I can do it.  Everyone's saying it's lame, though.  Yeah, no one's thinking it's like above and beyond. 
[01:41:00]  Keep the girl away from Jim so we can get something out of him today.  Oh, sorry.  Because God knows we got nothing out of you yesterday.  You did.  A lot of bad, weak attempts of humor.  I want to see any of these callers if they think they're so big and bad and tough.  Come in here.  You put a cigarette on your tongue, and then after you're crying in pain, I'll kick you in the butt.  Hard words there.  Wow.  Hold on now.  I'll kick you in your balloon knot.  That's better.  Oh, I...  Wow.  Those are fighting words.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  How about I'll grab pliers and pinch your Vaz Debrans? 
[01:41:30]  Little needle-nose fellas.  All right, Robin.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's up?  We're getting requests for those calls.  We're not coming in today.  Robin, what's up?  Nothing.  I was thinking maybe you could wipe off her tongue so it's nice and dry.  That's fine.  Nice and crackly.  Crackly.  There is no trick to it.  It doesn't matter.  Either that or try the cigar.  I like the cigar.  You can't do that. 
[01:42:00]  Why not?  Well, you could do that, but you just can't say it.  Thank you, Robin.  Maybe you can say cigar.  We got it.  No, no, no, no, no.  For the other chick.  You put the cigar in the other girl's balloon knot and have the other girl eat it.  Yeah, well, you know something?  Your popularity with the listeners, not with the staff here.  Not you.  Shut up.  Jack off.  Thanks, Robin.  Uh-huh.  You've done the survey.  You know my popularity.  I'm looking at the instant freebacks.  Your popularity is dropping quickly.  You're going to have to do something. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, come on, guys.  You're going to have to do something.  You're coming across a little too cocky for our listeners.  You know whose popularity is going to skyrocket?  Dumpster chick.  Yeah, dumpster chick.  Well, you want to know how would you feel if you drove, like, really far and you spent  the last of your money to get down here.  Whining, bitching, and complaining does not make your popularity go off of the listeners.  Yes.  Hey.  There you go.  That's going to help your popularity.  She's going further.  Oh, yeah.  Guys, she's naked.  Come on.  Almost. 
[01:43:00]  Very close.  Very close.  Get a little naked.  Don't be shy.  Trimmed, I see.  Is it?  Yes.  Can't help.  Keep yourself very trimmed.  All right.  You can stay as long as you like.  Thank you.  Wow, wee, what a dish.  Can I put a cigarette on my tongue now?  Because it's almost done, see?  You've got other ones, don't you?  Mm-hmm.  I have a whole box.  Yeah.  I'll say.  Don't worry about it.  Mary wants to pipe in here.  Mary, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, boys.  I just want to say that I'll let Norton put a cigarette or a cigar, even better, a cigar, 
[01:43:30]  out on my hand, just to shut this bitch up.  I'm tired of her.  Stop lying.  Whatever.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Come on up here.  Come on.  I would, but I'm cooking good.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you look at the country music and look at my bush and you'll see it.  Whoa, the big C word cannot be used on our airwaves.  Why don't you go back to your box of Twinkies, chick?  Ooh.  Uh-uh.  Whatever.  I'm a little bit of a beer tomorrow.  Hey.  Hold on.  Mary, Mary, you cannot curse. 
[01:44:00]  Come on up here.  You cannot curse.  Come on right now.  Please, you're killing us.  I'm sorry.  She's just talking and talking.  It isn't about me.  Which Mary is this?  I don't know who it is.  From Sex for Sam?  Sam, yeah.  Oh.  You want to come on?  No, I mean, it's just not pain management.  It's about putting saliva on your tongue, and that's not even touching the surface of your  tongue.  So that's not.  All right.  No. 
[01:44:30]  All right, Mary.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  She's a little potty mouth.  Yeah.  Go get banged by 10 more million guys, Mary.  Whoa.  Nice comeback.  Dan, what's going on?  Dan.  Hello.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Where is he?  At the machine shop?  Cab driver Ricky.  This guy never works either. 
[01:45:00]  Hey, what's happening, man?  Burr, burr, burr, burr.  He loves our show, though.  Ricky, what's up?  I think she should put a car lighter on her tongue.  That's just, I mean, that would be cool.  I ain't calling you, ladies.  That is, that is, that is a brander.  Put a car lighter on her tongue.  I already have brands on my body.  I don't need one.  You're branded?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're branded.  Let me see.  All right, Ricky, we've got to let it go.  Let me see where you're branded.  Let me see where you're branded.  All right, she's going to show us some branding.  She's taking her boot off.  Watch that language. 
[01:45:30]  Why don't we just cut off half her foot so she can't run?  Yeah, come on, guys.  That's not language.  I'm sorry.  I was very angry.  I'm feeling angry.  And it's decision time.  What are we going to do here?  Carrie, is there anything else to spice it up a bit?  Yes, sir.  Is there anything else to spice it up?  Well, what if I'm, like, naked, like, in a pretzel, putting a cigarette on my tongue?  That pretzel thing.  You're really pushing that.  Let her do the pretzel thing. 
[01:46:00]  It's really good, though.  I mean, my feet over my head, how many people can do that?  And, like, staying like that.  Okay, can we stick her head in the toilet?  No, stop it.  That toilet is so gross.  No one's cleaning this life.  Come on, just have her stick her head in the toilet for, like, five seconds under the water.  Her cigarette stuff is stupid.  Jesus, Rick.  Her pretzel stuff is stupid.  Stick her head in the toilet.  Rick.  Because it'll shut her up at the same time.  Come on.  Jeez, Rick.  You know, usually.  What do I do to you, Rick?  Exactly.  You're annoying.  I think, I mean, I think it's on to something. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  I like the swirly in the toilet idea.  Maybe for another girl if Carrie's not into it.  You know, because a lot of these girls are saying they'll do anything.  That's a good idea.  She's leaving.  Hey, what happened to her?  What happened?  No, no.  Where did you go?  She just called Rick a D-head.  Rick, what did you do?  I said what I said.  You're ruining it.  Rick.  All right, bring her back in. 
[01:47:00]  I want to see what her problem is with you.  Rick.  It's so funny, man.  Rick.  No, I know the deal.  I'm getting vibes.  I've got to see my cat.  Chewing up air time for nothing.  Carrie, what's wrong?  I've got to see my cat.  Carrie, what's wrong?  What happened?  I came like two and a half hours.  I know.  I'm asking my money to get down here.  Right.  And?  And?  Mm-hmm.  What?  How dare you?  What a curse.  Well, we've got to watch.  All right, all right, all right.  Can't say the F word.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Honey, we need something from you. 
[01:47:30]  You're dragging us down.  The listeners don't want to hear this.  They don't want to hear you talk.  They want to hear you scream out of pain.  Because then we're going to stuff your body into a 55-gallon drum and torture you for four hours.  So let's do it.  Let's rock.  I came up with some good ideas.  Rick is so high.  You can put a cigarette on your tongue.  I want to see you do it.  It's cake.  Everybody says, oh, it's no big deal.  All the smokers do it.  Yeah, everybody says it's no big deal.  Big deal.  They're on the phone.  They're not in here.  You care?  We care about the Earl Weaver. 
[01:48:00]  Let me tell you.  We've got to play the Earl Weaver thing.  I don't care.  Every time Earl Weaver's mentioned, we've got to play the thing.  I'll put a cigarette on my arm.  You think I'm afraid of something?  I have no pain in the heart.  Stick your head in the toilet.  Five seconds.  Hold your breath.  We won't flush it.  I promise.  You really got to settle down and maybe do some lines of coke to bring yourself back  up.  I need to balance out.  You like doing poor man's speed balls there with your cold medicine.  I didn't see you come up with any ideas.  I talked to you on a...  I didn't even come in. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, Rick.  She did talk to you, man.  And I came up with a bunch of ideas.  Hey, stupid.  Hello.  You listen to the radio.  Excuse me, darling.  My IQ is up.  Excuse me, darling.  And call up and come down and do it.  Darling, my IQ is 141.  I'm in Mensa.  What are you?  Oh, look, I'm a conner, but I won't take my pants off.  I did call a show with a bunch of ideas.  And none of them were any good.  Yeah, that's why you told me I'll come on down.  That it was great.  That you talked to them and it was a great idea. 
[01:49:00]  Well, you know what?  Your jazzing up of your human pretzels still sucked.  What can I tell you?  We tried.  I tried to work it with you, but they didn't want it.  You're making everyone a little uncomfortable, Rick.  What?  It's not nothing that doesn't need to be said, for Christ's sakes.  I kind of liked the idea.  I was going along with the goddamn slip and slide.  Fine by me.  I thought that was good.  Apparently it's not good enough for Rick. 
[01:49:30]  Well, obviously it isn't Rick's show.  Oh, it's got me.  Obviously, Rick doesn't have a radio show.  Oh, I have had a radio show, douchebag.  Oh, do you have one right now?  No, you're just flying with someone else's coattail.  Oh, oh, oh, ow, that hurts.  Let me go cry in a corner.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus.  What the hell's going on?  I'm going into this guy.  You're tired.  Nyquil.  Cold medicine should have a warning label on this.  He just blah, blah, blah. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, you want to see my tattoo?  No, we don't want to see your stupid tattoo.  We want you to endure some pain.  I killed a bunch of things.  Stick your head in the toilet.  I'll leave.  You guys have to go.  It will shut you up and you'll be in.  Oh, my God.  No.  Rick, see what you've done now, Rick.  Rick, look at what you did.  He's leaving.  Stupid furry boots.  Who wears furry boots?  She's a nice dumper, though, Rick.  Now she's leaving.  Rick, you haven't made me laugh in a long time.  This is hilarious.  How many times has she come back?  I say, well, five. 
[01:50:30]  We're on.  This will be.  Someone talk her into coming back.  Yeah.  Rick, talk her into coming back.  Yeah.  Yeah, this isn't good.  Oh, my God.  Rick just loses his mind.  Yeah.  This isn't good.  They're talking to her outside the studio.  Holy smoke.  I love when it gets uncomfortable.  John from Jersey.  Hey, it's Psycho Rick.  Mad Max is funny on the quill.  Well, put her head in the toilet for an hour.  Ben, what's going on?  Ben loves his stuff, too. 
[01:51:00]  She's just swearing, yelling, skim, so Norton's out there, like, hugging her.  Come on.  Just come back in.  You're doing great.  You want to be in radio?  Come on.  He's still trying to get a piece.  Yeah, exactly.  He's trying to get laid.  Norton's the type of guy that goes to a funeral to get the sympathy F.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  Carrie.  Now, Rick.  Are you crying?  Hang on, man.  There's no crying on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm pissed.  All right.  And, well, you should be.  Do you have something to say, Rick?  Rick is being a tool.  I'm waiting for an apology from him. 
[01:51:30]  Rick.  No, Molly Ringwald.  I'm not going to give you an apology.  Stick your head in the toilet.  Stick your head in the toilet.  I already said I would.  I want to stick your head in the toilet.  So do it.  Shut up and do it.  Zip it.  You are such an ugly moron, okay?  And you are a loser.  And I can't wait for you to have a nervous breakdown and wind it in the mental hospital.  Okay.  Okay.  Hopefully you'll be in the room right next door so I can shove your head in the toilet.  No.  I hope so so I can kill you while you're sleeping.  Ooh. 
[01:52:00]  Nice.  I know you are, but what am I?  That was good.  That was a good comeback.  As I take a knife to your throat.  Oh, wow.  No better yet, a gun to your head.  But there would be nothing but hollow when it came out.  And then get two guns and then maybe get a cannon and shoot it at my head.  Go hang on Opie's coattails.  Ooh.  Wow.  That's not nice.  Go kiss Opie's butt a little bit more.  Okay.  Why don't you talk about the Opie and Anthony show?  You know what, sweetheart?  Sweetheart, sweetheart, I bet if Opie wasn't marrying your sister, you wouldn't be working here. 
[01:52:30]  I don't have a job anymore.  I miss that one.  She really hit the butt.  If Opie wasn't marrying your sister, I'm sure you would still be working here.  Opie's not marrying my sister, so there you go, Molly.  You know what Rick sounds like?  This is exactly what I heard coming through the hotel wall in New Orleans when he was yelling  at his wife.  When I lost my ATM card.  When you lost your ATM card.  You're a nasty, bitter man, Rick.  Wow.  You're a nasty, bitter man, Rick.  Carries all this stuff.  It's a good way to keep your job, Rick, isn't it?  Because you're so confident. 
[01:53:00]  I am.  Yeah.  That's why I'm here, douchebagot.  You're still out unemployed.  Okay.  Okay.  You don't know anything about me.  I don't know.  My resume is so much better than your job.  Oh, my God.  Everybody, everybody listen up.  She's going to tell us about her resume.  This is going to be great radio.  Holy cow.  Hey, hot jobs.  Get ready.  It's going to be a big resume.  Take up space on your internet site that she's going to put up there.  And Jesus Christ, everybody's going to want to hire you.  You know what, sweetheart?  I'm not. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, wow.  Something so original, so funny, yet dump because it's so stupid.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  Rick.  So are you going to stick her in the toilet?  I've never seen him like this before.  Tell you the truth.  I think it's the cold medicine.  Yeah, he's freaked out.  There's actually an intelligent woman in the room, and he can't deal with it.  What is it?  Hey, somebody actually worth talking to is on the hotline. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, look who's there.  That was a Frenchie?  No.  No, no.  No, we don't want to burn out Frenchie.  Olympic skater.  It's an Olympic skater.  Yeah, but this is too good right this moment.  Are we all right?  Everyone going to be okay?  I'm cool.  Oh, she sticks her head in the toilet.  I don't want to jump in and mind anything.  Yes, yes.  Sometimes maybe the Olympic skater is obviously an important guy.  You let cool her heads as everybody settles down for a couple minutes.  Settle down a bit. 
[01:54:30]  Separate these two, I think.  That'll give you more time to comfort her.  Look, this has nothing to do with the fact that I think she's really sexy, and I like her.  That's a secondary thing.  My disgusting little mule is not the point here.  Okay, we can do that.  We can separate these two.  Huh?  What did you say about her butt?  I heard she'll say anything.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Nice haircut.  Oh, you got me again.  What do you get done in hair cuttery?  That's three times you said that joke.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  You're worse than Voss.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Voss.  He's not one.  Voss.  I know.  I love Voss.  Voss is talent, sweetheart.  I love Voss.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we separate these two for a bit, and you can sit outside with Norton, maybe.  You can help me out.  All right.  Oh, Jim, you're staying right there.  Yeah, you're going to stay here.  It's about what she wants to leave.  I've got to...  All right.  Stinky, could you escort the lovely lady outside while we talk to Olympic skater Mike 
[01:55:30]  Weiss, and then we'll have you come back in.  Don't go anywhere.  Don't go nowhere, though.  Oh, Jesus.  You lost your mind, Rick.  I give her credit, though, just because she was threatening to cut someone's throat.  That's always fun.  That's great.  In the middle of, like, a joke argument, I'll cut your throat.  Mike.  Mike Weiss.  Hey.  Sorry you had to be privy to that on the other end of that phone line.  You guys just surround yourself with angry people, don't you? 
[01:56:00]  It's Rick.  He took cold medicine, and he's all screwed up in the head.  I don't know what it is.  Mike Weiss, I saw your swan song performance.  Yeah.  In the men's figure skating.  Yeah, that was me.  And that's it.  You're how old?  Are you 25, they said?  Yeah, 25.  And you're hanging up the skates.  Well, you know, don't believe everything you hear.  I don't know yet.  Could be maybe another Olympic bid in the future. 
[01:56:30]  I think he enjoyed the limelight a little bit.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, you know what?  I skated so well at the end.  And I just, you know, there might be some more left in me.  I don't know.  We'll see.  Mike, we talked about you for about a half hour because we've never seen a straight guy skate before.  That's the big story here.  You know something?  I've been watching the figure skating, the pairs.  Very interesting.  The whole judge thing with the French judge and all that and the pair skating.  And then I was watching the men's single, Skate. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  And I'm looking and I'm just sitting there going, oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  And then you hit the ice.  I'm like, and there's his wife up in the stands.  And I'm going, oh, wait, wait a minute.  Let me look.  I look and there's this blonde bombshell up in the stands.  I'm like, there's got to be, that is the best guy in drag I've ever seen because there's  no way in hell that a figure skater has a hot life like this.  And I was wrong.  How is that for you, being, working around, and this has got to be, every other guy has 
[01:57:30]  to be a gay gentleman.  Is this true?  You know, there are.  I don't know.  It's a touchy situation because figure skating is a sport that, you know, has a lot of artistry  in it.  And, you know, to stereotype people, gay people happen to be very artistic.  That's what I was saying.  You know something?  I was saying this, too.  I go, how does that?  Because you're very good.  I mean, you're very good.  And I'm watching going, how does a heterosexual guy show such emotion with his body like that 
[01:58:00]  on the ice?  I couldn't imagine how you could do that because, you know, us dopey guys, you get out on the  dance floor, you do the dopey white man dance, and you try to get laid in the bar.  You look down at your feet, you know.  But it's like, you're, you know, very artistic out on the ice, and I couldn't believe that  you were a hetero.  How did you get into it?  I still have to limit a lot of my skating stuff, too, because there's a certain look,  you know, that the international and all the judges look for. 
[01:58:30]  Right.  When I do show programs and I'm not being judged, you know, I go out there in a tie-dye  t-shirt and, you know, jeans, and, you know, I've skated to Santana, I've skated to the  Doors.  So, you know, I have a good time.  What you're saying is you're butch it up, Mike.  Well, you know, you know what?  I do what I'm comfortable doing.  You know, some people might be comfortable skating to Madame Butterfly.  I'm comfortable, you know, skating to Van Halen.  Nice.  You know, whatever you feel good doing.  Mike, how did you get into figure skating, though?  Yeah, what, was hockey full? 
[01:59:00]  You got cut from the team?  What happened?  No, actually, I do play hockey.  Yeah, you do?  Yeah, I grew up playing hockey in the D.C. area.  Yeah.  And I started figure skating, started hockey.  Hockey was a team sport, and, you know, I'm not a team player.  I don't know.  I like the individualism of figure skating.  You know, if I screw up, I'm the only one to blame, but if I hit it, then I'm the only  one that takes the glory, too.  And I kind of, you know, I kind of like that about figure skating.  It wasn't necessarily, you know, all the cliches of figure skating, like gliding on the 
[01:59:30]  ice and floating through the air.  That wasn't my thing.  Yeah.  I just liked it because, basically, the ratio from men to women in figure skating is like  200 women to one man.  There you go.  There's an answer.  The guy angle.  And then you figure all the gay guys out of it, and, man, your chances are real good.  One in two million.  No, no.  But, yeah, that's how I basically got into figure skating, and I started to realize that, 
[02:00:00]  hey, you know, I'm the only guy in this rink.  Right.  And, you know.  What did you think of Timothy Gable?  I cashed in on it with my wife.  What did you think of Timothy Gable's performance?  He skated well.  Yeah.  He did a good program.  I mean, he skated real solid.  It was unfortunate for me that I skated first in the short program.  Yeah.  Out of 30 skaters, and I skated a clean short program, skated real well, but the judges  don't mark you high when you skate early.  Yeah.  It was a completely random draw, but I skated at the end. 
[02:00:30]  I probably would have been, you know, skating a long program for a medal, but.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  They kind of.  They got to keep the scores low.  I know.  At the beginning, they got to keep it low, so if somebody does better and better and  better, they increase the score.  What do you think about the whole judging thing?  I'm sure you've been asked that a million times, but what's your take on it?  Oh, you know, I actually, I'm pretty good friends with Jamie and David, the Canadian  pair team.  Yeah.  I toured with them on the Champions on Ice tour, and, you know, they're cool people.  I was going to try and have them call in and leave a message on the FU line for the French 
[02:01:00]  judge.  Now, that would be cool.  We hear you listen to the show.  That would be funny.  Big FU to the French judge.  That's classic.  We hear you listen to the show down there in D.C. a little bit.  Yeah, I do.  I do.  That's so cool.  You know, I'm a big fan of Don and Mike, and, you know, when they switched, I started  listening to you guys, and you guys are awesome.  I love it.  You're cool, man.  Thanks.  You mean you didn't hate us at first, like everyone else?  No, actually, I took you guys right away.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:01:30]  I mean, just right away, you guys were awesome.  I thought maybe early on you'd give us low scores.  I'm trying to recruit some people in D.C.  Well, we could use the help.  Hey, why weren't you holding a teddy bear there when you were getting your scores, Mike?  Oh, I must have dropped that.  I dropped the teddy bear.  I like the teddy bear holding.  What do you think is going to happen in the women's skating?  I don't know.  I don't know, man.  We have a strong team.  The U.S. women are awesome this year.  I mean, Michelle Kwan could take home the gold.  You don't like the Hughes girl from Long Island there, Ropey?  I like the Hughes girl because I have a feeling it might be related to her. 
[02:02:00]  Of course.  I'm serious.  She looks like all my cousins, so I'm trying to figure out if I'm related to her.  That's true.  But I really like the Sasha girl.  Oh, you like Sasha?  Sasha.  She's 16.  And she skated a better program than Michelle Kwan, Anthony.  Do you think so, Ropey?  No, no, no.  In your professional opinion, you could be a French judge.  She was more flexible than Michelle Kwan.  Oh, more flexible.  And she got that extra point in my book.  I don't like, you know, I like the determination and the drive to win on these things, Mike. 
[02:02:30]  But someone like Michelle Kwan, she seems a little too driven, and it's too important to her to get that gold.  It seems like the gold usually goes to the people that are a little more relaxed and a little more just happy to be at the goddamn Olympics.  Yeah, I don't know.  You know, all of our women have their own advantages.  I mean, Michelle is the girl who's been here before, and she knows exactly what she's doing.  She's a pro.  Sarah's a young girl.  Sasha's a young girl.  I'm a big fan of Sasha.  I mean, the stuff that she does from a skating standpoint is really, really tough stuff. 
[02:03:00]  I mean, I can't even attempt to get into some of the positions that she gets into.  Well, that's because you've got a yambet.  That's right.  But, no, I mean, she's awesome.  And Sarah Hughes, too.  I mean, she's a young skater who goes out there and just never holds anything back.  I mean, she comes to compete all the time.  Yeah.  So, I mean, it's a toss-up.  You never know.  I mean, there's four minutes there out on the ice of your skating, and you just never know.  But you can't predict anything at the Olympics, because crazy things happen, as everybody's seen the last two weeks. 
[02:03:30]  I've never seen that.  Mike, did you go to the rink in your outfit already, or did you have to, like, you know, share the locker room with everybody else there?  No, I slept in it.  That's what I did.  Mike slept in it.  He goes to the rink, fully dressed and ready to go.  All right, I'm done.  Skates on.  He don't care.  Walks across the parking lot in his skates.  Mike, did you?  He doesn't want to attempt that one.  Mike, did your friends rag you a little bit, or did they tool on you a little? 
[02:04:00]  Well, you know what's funny is my wife will meet people all the time, and they'll be like, oh, you know, what do you do?  What does your husband do?  And she's like, oh, my husband's a figure skater.  And their first question is, oh, is he gay?  I mean, what a dumb question.  Yeah, I'm married to him.  He's gay.  Yeah.  I'm married to him.  We have two kids, and then he's gay.  Yeah.  That's a long way to go for a beard.  Those are stereotypes.  You know, you've got to get over that, whatever.  You know, it's like, you know, you're a hockey player.  Yeah, well, is he dumb?  You know, I mean, there's a dumb stereotype.  Was your outfit made by Vera Wang? 
[02:04:30]  Who made your outfit, Mike?  Actually, a lady from right up in New York City, Tanya Bass, made my costumes.  And she makes a lot of different figure skatering costumes, but my goal is to work.  It's a little more conservative than some of the other ones I've seen.  I said, make sure there are no sequins on my costume in New York.  You rock.  I'm looking, you came out, and it's like, you know, it's almost like when he comes out  on the ice, it was like Tony Manero's taking the goddamn ice, is what it looked like.  I'm like, all right, this guy is kind of, one of these things is not like the other thing. 
[02:05:00]  But you did a great job.  You're really talented.  Thanks.  And hopefully you won't retire, and in four years we'll see you again.  And you inspired Anthony.  Did you hear the dice on ice bit?  I didn't hear.  Well, I'm not home.  I'm not home.  Anyway, I'm still in Salt Lake City.  I'm actually walking around the cafeteria, the Olympic Village cafeteria right now.  I just got an autograph from Mario Lemieux, Wayne Gretzky, Eric Lindrup, and Steve Eisenman.  I was psyched.  Did Gretzky complain that Lemieux's autograph wasn't good enough? 
[02:05:30]  So you're still at the Olympic Village?  Yeah, I'm still here.  I've been doing stuff all week.  We have sponsored events and interviews.  I've been doing stuff on MSNBC.  I'm hearing there's a lot of sex going on.  What are you hearing?  No, I'm serious.  Supposedly they're handing out condoms like crazy, and I guess they had to shut down the  hot tubs because the sex in the hot tubs was out of control?  Making soup.  I don't know.  I can't sneak my wife in the village, so I don't know.  Yeah, this guy, if you saw his wife over, you would know.  He doesn't have to worry about trying to find sex in the village. 
[02:06:00]  No, I'm not saying he's personally partaking, but I'm wondering what he's hearing and seeing  himself.  That's all.  A lot of fun there, though, big party?  I don't know.  You get a lot of horny athletes in one place.  I don't know what's going to happen.  Cool, Mike.  It was great talking to you, man.  Thanks.  Thanks.  No, I just want to mention one other thing, too.  If people want to come watch me skate, I'm going to be doing a 93-show city.  The John Hancock Champions on Ice will be in New York.  It will be everywhere.  Everywhere all over the country, from April to August. 
[02:06:30]  Nice.  Cool, man.  Come out and watch me.  All right.  Hey, Mike.  Yeah.  Could you hold on to the line?  Because we want to send you the Dyson Ice bit, because you inspired Anthony, and it was  one of the funniest things that we've had on the radio lately.  I'd love it.  I'd love it.  That would be awesome.  I love his Dyson impression.  All right, cool.  Hey, thanks.  All right.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right, cool.  Take care, guys.  There he goes, Mike Weiss from D.C.  There you go.  An Olympic skater.  Look at us now talking to Olympic athletes. 
[02:07:00]  What is going wrong with this program?  What's wrong with this show?  Look at us.  We're relevant.  Who's next?  Peek-a-boo?  Are we going to get peek-a-boo?  We made figure skating sound fun, I think.  Did we?  It was kind of fun, and there was a few chuckles in there.  Someone on SNPBAC said I got my line of the day in there.  You did?  Which one?  Because you have a yambag.  Oh, the yambag.  So I got an hour and 15 minutes to come up with a second good line today.  I think I could do it.  I'm feeling pretty good about myself right now.  Oh, brother. 
[02:07:30]  Are we going to do this?  What are we doing with the girls?  I want to heat that little one in the dumpster.  I think that Rick was a little too hard on her.  Just a tad.  And I'll tell you why.  I'm not just because she's hot.  I don't care what she looks like.  You want to get girls down for the drum challenge.  And maybe the ice cream thing was a little lame, but I mean, a girl is willing to, A,  get into a drum and have stuff dumped on her.  Right.  B, put a cigarette out on her tongue.  I wouldn't put a cigarette out on my tongue.  I don't care how much saliva.  You have a clearer tongue first.  If she's going to put a cigarette on it, it's not bad. 
[02:08:00]  Dude, chill.  You're in.  All right?  Relax.  You don't have to work it anymore.  Oh, my God.  Going to the stairwell?  You're pathetic.  All right.  Stop working it.  You're in.  Goddamn gloves think you turn into a brothel.  You had her at hello.  Nah, she's...  You had me at hello.  You work it.  You embarrass yourself and all of mankind.  Dude, every guy out there understands what I'm doing.  Yeah, but when you know you have it, then you back off a little.  No, guys, I don't understand. 
[02:08:30]  I need a lot of girls in the studio.  Just shut it down.  And I get nothing from them.  Go down to, like, third gear.  Relax.  You're cruising now.  You're in.  You were amusing today.  Goodbye.  Well, maybe we could, uh, no.  Hey, uh, Anthony?  Having problems with the old sperm band.  I know.  I have to walk into a room and hug a lady in a tub.  And 20 legs of lamb.  You like ice cream, Doc?  Hello.  You know what?  We might blow off the rest of the girls that are trying out for the 55-gallon drum challenge 
[02:09:00]  because I see Ron and Fez kind of circling outside the door.  That means Paul Lowe and Sandy Kane are here.  There's a family staying up there.  And with the big storm and all.  Anthony?  Larry called Larry in, uh, Denver.  She did call Larry.  Looking for the snow cat.  Go check it out.  God damn.  Why is, uh...  You make each other laugh.  Oh, it's great.  Why is Steve Kingston on CNN? 
[02:09:30]  What?  Douchebag.  Worst program director.  Oh, wait a minute.  Holy jeez.  We ought to dump out of that.  Can't use that C word like that.  No.  He thinks we don't know what he does behind our back, you douche.  Sometimes he could say it in the context of a fight.  Yeah.  Have one of those fights.  Yeah, like two men just battling it out.  Not like that.  Oh.  Roosters.  Oh.  For all the people wondering why we don't have bands on this show, one name, Steve Kingston.  There you go.  And then behind our back, he tells the bosses, no, they're free to have whoever they want 
[02:10:00]  on the air.  Then he goes to the record company.  Douchebag.  I wish you were a reporter overseas.  Maybe that's who they wanted to get in the first place.  It was a case of mistaken identity.  For one big happy family, right, Steve?  Douche.  All right, Anthony.  Is he a bad program director? 
[02:10:30]  He's the worst in America.  Do you mean, is there like, like.  He has the cushiest gig in all of radio.  Is there only one show holding that whole place together?  And if you really focus and go, okay, Steve, what have you, you personally done for this  radio station?  You got to take out this big part of your radio station.  What is left?  Not much.  Dick.  I gots the cheddar.  I could pay to rank.  Four, three, two.  All right. 
[02:11:00]  See, a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  Oh, my God.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ronnie in the studio.  Yeah.  Ron.  Ron and Fez heard here in New York.  I told you time and time again, I have no idea if he's gay. 
[02:11:30]  Right after that.  Get off my back.  I know as much as you guys.  I was supposed to answer it on the air.  We asked off to you.  Oh, okay.  Is it anything sacred?  All I know is that he's a fine program director over there.  And he looks nothing like that guy.  That's not what I was saying.  I'm in enough trouble.  All right.  Where's Polo?  Polo is down in the office.  So, waiting to make out with Twato. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  This is going to be the showstopper today.  Everyone knows what Twato is by now.  It's genital herpes, Anthony.  Yes.  Is it?  Yeah.  That's what we...  Diagnosed by three doctors, my friend.  Hold it.  Mouth cancer was also diagnosed on a guy.  Right.  And it turned out to be nothing.  It was a tic-tac.  And one of the doctors was the one that was on Temptation Island.  Hey, man.  Some doctor.  I believed her.  She was hot enough.  Really?  She was.  Anyway, but a doctor?  Here's the thing. 
[02:12:30]  Are you saying that you would never make out with Twato?  Never.  Billion dollars?  Never.  Billion.  Billion dollars?  No.  Billion?  I'd bite it off and I'd eat it.  I do.  You can't put those figures out there.  That is right.  You can't do that.  I hate this.  You can't do that.  I hate the stupid figures.  A billion dollars?  You get it.  You're like, all right.  Where do you get a billion dollars from?  First of all, everyone is saying yes.  From your Enron stock?  All right.  No, maybe the government.  Maybe George Bush would say, I would like to see someone make out. 
[02:13:00]  You know what it is?  No, I hate those things because saying you would is like all of a sudden, ew, you would.  You're disgusting.  Right.  How about, like...  Give me the billion and then we'll see how I feel.  How about, like, something we could grasp, like $200,000 in quarters?  Right.  Ooh.  No, but a billion is...  And throw one at a time at her as hard as you can at her head.  That would be worth it.  Well, the thing with Polo is that he's interested in doing something different.  Something...  He's excited.  He didn't get it.  Well, where is Polo?  Polo's down in the office now. 
[02:13:30]  I'm hearing that he's having a second death.  He's a little nervous.  Is he?  But I guarantee to miss that if he makes out with Twato tonight on our show, in the Rana  Fez show, he gets a brand new tattoo, Twato, to remember the day.  Wow.  Look at you.  That's good.  Some nice cross-promoting.  That is good.  I'll throw the cash around.  If I got it.  If I had the billion, I'd give it to you.  Is it true that Polo was also in Caddyshack?  Yes, he was.  He was the waiter who fell in the pool in Caddyshack. 
[02:14:00]  I don't know when to believe him.  Wow.  You're one of the first guys I've met in my life that I can't read.  Is that right?  And I don't like that.  Was his performance worthy of an ass?  Yeah, he would love one.  I can't care.  It's a Caddyshack full of ass kids for Polo.  I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.  Is that him?  All right, we got him?  We're in.  All right, come on in, Polo.  Polo, where?  Polo, you like the movie.  Oh, Polo, you like the movie. 
[02:14:30]  How are you?  All right, Polo, first of all, Peel, let him get a full look at the bod.  All right.  Yeah, you might remember, Polo.  Wasn't Polo the same guy that really got a full life tattoo?  Yeah, I think.  I think white guy would appear really with a full life tattoo.  Wasn't you the one with the enema?  Yeah.  Yeah, good to see that the diet's working there.  Opie, remember?  Opie, do you remember when Brian Regan was in?  I can hold a weight.  Yeah, go ahead.  When Brian Regan was in one day, we all hung out. 
[02:15:00]  And when Ron and Fez came on and got completely hammered, and Polo was doing some kind of  a thing on Ron and Fez's show where he had an enema in, and he had to hold it, and we  were trying to find out who was the funniest person here at the station, and everyone would  go around telling jokes until he blasted out his enema.  We've got to do that again sometime.  Who won the contest?  Nobody remembers.  Nobody remembers who won.  Opie won the contest.  I never get credit for being funny.  Which, no, now stop it, because I'll even say something. 
[02:15:30]  I'll even say something here.  He just had to go.  No offense, Opie.  Opie, you're up against, excuse me, Brian Regan was here.  He was a little off.  Yeah, he was out.  That's true.  It wasn't a Regan night.  You know, you give him a few beers.  He's not as funny.  A little off.  You got John Lithgow to take an enema.  You do look like Lithgow.  Yeah.  And I heard something about you had me investigated the next day or something like that.  Well, now you're making sense.  Oh, you're in charge.  Oh, shut up. 
[02:16:00]  Now, are all of his tattoos tattoos that he's gotten on your program?  You know what?  First of all, for that last thing, Fezzy, give him a flare chop, please.  You got it.  A quick flare chop.  Oh!  Don't.  We get another question, right?  We hold still, don't we, Pete?  We hold still.  Ready?  Oh, no.  Wait.  Oh!  Oh, he's smacking him in the chest.  The guy doesn't play back?  No.  He's a movie reveal.  Really?  He's 6'4".  All right.  He dwarfs me.  Hey, Paulo, keep the shirt off. 
[02:16:30]  He almost knocked his belly button lint out.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  That's hair.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Hey, Ronnie.  Oh, wait a minute.  What about this?  Twato bangs the belly button.  Oh, that would be great.  That would be a good movie, Paulo.  Lube it up.  I'll go with that.  Paulo, were you really in Caddyshack?  Yes, sir.  Absolutely.  We just had a little discussion about that.  I want to tell him the part he's on.  He's rolling up his belly button lint.  Yeah, I dropped it.  Jesus.  Put that down.  Stop picking it.  Stop picking it.  Yeah, I was knocked into the pool, and I was in the dining room scene for like 10 minutes. 
[02:17:00]  10 minutes?  I was acting up the storm.  He was behind the actual scene, doing the very silent peas and carrots.  Peas and carrots.  Peas and carrots.  That's all they say, right?  Yeah, that's all they say.  Peas and carrots.  I never say peas and carrots.  What do you say?  No, I've never gotten a keg.  Just peas.  I've never gotten a keg.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah, it's impressive.  I've got to ask, are all his tats, tats that he's gotten on this program?  Yeah, different tats that he has.  Turnaround polo.  What has he got?  He's got thug life on his belly. 
[02:17:30]  You see the thug life?  Yeah, that's great.  Life sucks on his arm.  Life sucks.  He wanted that.  That was his choice.  Self-explanatory.  Then, uh...  That's just a weird eye.  I don't know why.  That eye, well, I remember that.  That eye came on his back back when Dorian left.  Let's say more paranoid days when a lot of us wish we had an eye on our back.  Right.  Before we knew the powder was bad for us.  I hear you.  Back in the crazy late 1990s.  Before we were sure that Columbia had no exports for the rest of us. 
[02:18:00]  Tupac and Biggie together for ever.  And then, uh...  And then it's little bullets with wings on them.  Angel wings.  And this guy is the whitest guy you will ever see in your life.  He looks insane.  The arm is kind of cool.  What is that?  This was his last trip to New York.  It's Boy Band 2000 Tour.  That's what it actually says on the arm. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Then it's the logos of 98 Degrees.  Yeah.  Below that, Backstreet Boys logo.  And then a really nice NSYNC logo.  The problem is, I think 98 Degrees is out of business.  Yeah, in hindsight, that was a mistake.  Do you ever take your shirt off in public?  No, I'm pretty prudish.  That's a good thing to...  Has anyone dug up his basement?  No.  He would never kill children and bury them.  Paul Lowe, would you?  Yeah, sure.  I would, uh... 
[02:19:00]  You know, that's...  I got a lot of...  If I ever started, I would kill a lot.  Well, he's a go-getter.  Well, that's good.  At least he's honest.  Edmund Chimbley.  But more importantly, who is his pick for the Oscar, the best picture?  Best picture.  Best picture.  Best picture.  Best picture.  Yeah, my favorite picture of the year is not really in heavy contention.  It's A.I.  It's very controversial.  A.I.  A.I.  I loved it.  I can't get it.  Hey, I think it's your way best picture, Oscar.  Get, get, get, get.  Hey, I think it gets a bag full of Oscars. 
[02:19:30]  Hey, I was the only one left to the theater.  Everyone else walked out.  Get, get, get.  And I also love Memento and Mahomes.  You look like Memento with all those tattoos.  Where are you going to put the Twato tattoo?  I like across that big red, that red spot in his chest.  The chest that just raised up like a giant welt.  That handprint?  Yeah.  Matches this one.  Oh!  He hits him again.  Oh.  I can't believe it was a rock. 
[02:20:00]  The flare chop.  Hey, can I ask Paul something?  Have you ever done the cigarette trick?  We had a girl that wanted to put a cigarette out on her tongue.  No, I haven't done that, but they did do a lot of branding on the behind.  You've been branded on your ass.  You've branded them too?  Well, one time, it was a thing that he asked for to be branded.  Yeah, I did ask for that.  But, uh, why he was getting the brand, well, it was really just a, uh...  Homemade.  Yeah.  Because they're always best.  We used a coat hanger and lit it up with some sternum.  But one time when he was getting branded on the ass, it went down a little too low and 
[02:20:30]  caught him on the sack.  I don't know how this thing happened.  Again, those days were crazy.  The late 90s, everybody was on everything then.  Now we know.  So the cigarette thing is a piece of cake, you think?  Yeah, you should have to have some spit in your mouth.  Yeah, I guess.  That's nothing.  It really is nothing.  If it's a regular carny trick, it shouldn't be a problem.  What is that stuff?  For a regular carny.  Hey, I've got to interrupt a little bit, because Stephanie might do the toilet bowl trick. 
[02:21:00]  Oh!  To get in the 55-gallon.  Hey, now we're talking.  Can we get Stephanie in for a sec?  Paulo, stay there, because you're the showstopper today.  Oh, yeah.  Courtesy of Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Is he stinking?  Oh, he's right.  Oh, yeah.  He don't travel well.  Oh, my God.  Hey, he's from where?  Florida?  Yeah.  Wait, you know what?  I don't like this intermingling of shows.  You're scaring our guests.  Your guest is scaring our guest.  Right.  She looks horrified.  Our guest is cuter than your guest.  Feet her up outside. 
[02:21:30]  Who split the lip?  Oh.  Oh, what happened?  That's a hair lip.  Did someone punch you?  That's a hair lip.  You got what?  Because if you were born that way, you'd cry.  Hair lip.  That's it.  It's all right.  That's a hair lip.  What are you going to do?  What do you think of Paulo?  He's great.  Yeah.  A little scary, right?  Damn, he does reach.  Yeah, he stinks.  Yeah, Paulo, you stink, man.  Keep that on.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Hold up.  All right, talk to Mike.  Get on real, Mike.  I haven't slept for 24 hours. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  What, he drove up here?  You don't even fly him?  No, he flew.  Okay.  Got a prop plane.  Stephanie, you'll do the toilet trick?  Yes, I'm going to do it.  We have a real...  You're going to put your head in the toilet?  We have a really nasty toilet.  Oh, I got shampoo.  Are you going to do it in bra and panties?  If you want me to.  Who doesn't want that?  And how far down will you go?  I'm putting my face in.  Wow.  How low will you go?  Wow.  Face in the toilet in her bra and panties.  How great is that?  She does that.  She's in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah, she should be. 
[02:22:30]  This rocks.  She's great.  And she's hotter than that other bitch.  I like the other one, too.  Yeah, me too.  I got to agree with that, too.  She's a nice girl.  Is Carrie still around?  God, I hope not.  Yeah, she is.  She should be around.  She's a nice girl.  All right.  The Osbournes, March 5th.  All right.  Hold on a sec.  Holly!  Yeah?  Ooh, Holly.  What's up?  Hey, Holly, what's up, man?  Hi.  What are you doing?  Why are you, like, breathing heavy and stuff?  Um, I'm not.  How fat are you?  What?  Well, relax, dude. 
[02:23:00]  She sounds hot, man.  She's just breathing.  She's got, like, a nice voice.  A sexy voice.  Yeah, you sound sexy.  You're from Boston?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why do you do that?  Yeah.  Why?  Huh?  What?  The, you know...  You guys are making fun of me.  No, no.  So why are you calling the show?  Okay, my friend Steve is, like, putting me up to doing that queef thing.  Ah, the 6 o'clock queef.  And that's so gross.  I can't believe I'm doing that.  Can you do it, though?  Yeah.  Oh, so how do you...  And why do you think it's gross if you can do it? 
[02:23:30]  It's something that seems like you'd have to practice at to get good at.  I don't know.  I just did it, like, one time when he was at my house.  All right.  Well, get ready while we play the intro music.  All right?  Oh, God.  Get ready.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Yeah, we did it, we did it, we did it.  Go out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tessa, let yourself roar. 
[02:24:00]  Queef.  All right, Holly.  Are you ready?  Are you here?  No, you've got to wait until we give you a cue.  Yeah, because we've got to make sure everyone is silent.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Get ready.  Ready.  Anytime you're ready.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Shh.  Oh, that was a little perky one.  Are you ready?  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not a sweet.  All right.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  We do it, we do it, we do it, we do it, we do it, we do it, we do it, we do it, we do it,  blow out the candles, make a wish, it's like a fart, but smells like fish. 
[02:24:30]  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Oh, keep.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor.  Tessa, let yourself roar.  Queef.  Ah, queef.  Sorry, Ronnie, we had to get that out of the way.  I don't blame it.  It's beautiful.  And I've never seen Fezzy so violent.  He's got that look in his eyes.  Fezzy looks angry today.  You have to keep the beast under control.  I guess.  He will run amok to climb up buildings.  He's like 8 inches taller than you and he won't fight back.  No, uh-uh.  No, no.  Why not?  That's your shirt. 
[02:25:00]  What's this?  Oh!  Wow!  Right across the gut.  That had to hurt.  That was a flare chop to the belly.  Ouch.  I love the guy.  Ah, that's sweet.  Wow.  That is real sweet.  That is really frightening.  Okay, quick break.  Then Stephanie with the toilet bowl and Paulo with making out with Twato.  Sandy Kane in the studio.  Wow.  Next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  No!  Oh, my God. 
[02:25:30]  What is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  They're on right after us here in New York City.  I think everyone knows that by now.  Yes.  A little insulted that we didn't get the big invite for the big show tomorrow night, but that's all right.  If you guys want to come out, we'd love to have you.  Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  Oh, oh.  She's doing a big fight night tomorrow night.  Big fight night.  I'm there, Ronnie.  I'm there.  Bar tab for both of you. 
[02:26:00]  All right?  And that includes apps.  Apps.  Nice.  We get appetizers.  We get apps.  Apps with that.  Hey, guys.  Have fun.  Hey, we're running out of time real quick, man.  When you guys are out there, please bring a picture back to Norton and show them what you look like out at our gig.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Well, here's what's going on.  We got Stephanie from Boston, from Twenton, right?  From Chatton.  I'm from Chatton.  Chatton.  Chatton.  Chatton.  Chatton.  Chatton. 
[02:26:30]  That's how I speak up there, Ronnie.  It's nice.  Sexy.  She came down with Becky.  Yeah.  What did Becky do?  I forgot at this point.  Oh, she ate the lamb eyes.  Yeah, she ate the lamb eyes covered in luscious chocolate.  I have a piece stuck in my shoe.  Shut up.  She's got a piece of...  She's got a little lens in your eye.  Okay.  Well, her friend decides she wants to hit it on the 55-gallon drum challenge as well.  So she's going to stick her head in the toilet bowl, Anthony.  Face face.  And only brawn panties.  Is that right?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  Only brawn panties.  All right.  Rip those clothes off and let's get to Duncan. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, I'm taking my clothes off here.  Oh, yeah.  It's so weird.  Because we got no time.  Well, just go out and brawn panties.  It's fine.  It's like wearing a bathing suit.  Yeah, it's like a bikini bathing suit.  It's going to happen anyway.  You might as well volunteer.  And you can't change in the bathroom.  It's like an airplane bathroom.  Liza, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I was down today.  I was down today for a Don and Mike's contest.  Yeah.  And I was really nervous.  And I definitely used the bathroom, like, four times just five hours ago.  Just so she knows. 
[02:27:30]  It's saying on the phone that you had the runs in our bathroom four times.  Oh, yeah.  Real bad.  Real nervous on that.  All right.  Well, I just, I'm sorry I had to take that call before you walked down the hall there.  I just thought Stephanie should know before she'd take the plug.  Thank you.  That was very nice of you.  Okay.  That's how I feel when I listen to it.  Why don't we walk Stephanie down the hall?  Do we have mics for out there?  Yeah.  Rick's got it all set.  And, Paulo, you're next.  Why is this girl topless?  I mean, not that I'm complaining, but...  I got half naked with Stephanie.  Nice rack. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Very nice.  Get her...  She wanted to be topless to kind of give her support.  That's nice.  A little topless support.  It helps.  Very good.  That's good.  Isn't it sad that someone else is here with bigger breasts?  Paulo.  His breasts a little bigger and beefier.  All right.  Well, we got to get Sandy Kane in here, too, for the showstop.  Come in here, you mess.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's get the Stephanie thing out of the way, because they're ready.  Get that mic over there, Sandy Kane.  Sandy Kane.  Sandy Kane, you frigging mutant. 
[02:28:30]  Get over there.  Get on that mic.  No.  Look at me.  I'm pointing.  Over there, stupid.  No, you jackass.  That mic doesn't work yet.  Good.  All right.  Rick.  Ricky.  Yo.  Yo.  All right.  Sandy, hold on.  It's not about you yet.  It'll be about you soon.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  All right.  Describe the scene.  All right.  We are in the...  You can't say that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let him dump it on.  Yes.  You can't say that.  We can't say things like they can say on the Ron and Fez show all the time. 
[02:29:00]  And there's a definite odor of, you know, the yellow discipline.  Stephanie, what does it smell like in there?  It smells nasty.  Yeah, this bathroom really is disgusting.  It is heinous.  Yeah.  There's no...  First of all, there's no ventilation.  Secondly, it's mostly just disgusting guys taking leaks and there's hairs that don't  come from your head all over the toilet.  And the toilet hasn't been cleaned in a long time. 
[02:29:30]  Let's not forget about Selsa Girl.  Actually, I wasn't talking about the toilet.  I thought I was talking about Sandy Ken's lap.  Big, disgusting men's room with hair.  No, she looks hurt.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.  Yeah.  All right, Rick.  Is she ready?  Yeah, she's ready.  She's staring face first into the ball.  Are we taking video of this?  Yeah.  Stinky's running video and she knows she's got to do it for five seconds and blow bubbles. 
[02:30:00]  I want to hear gurgling.  Get the mic right there.  Wait, wait, Rick.  Rick.  Yeah.  She's got to go the distance of a flush, man.  Nah.  Five seconds.  He is going to go down the drain.  Yeah.  Just have her put her face in and blow bubbles.  Ready?  All right, here we go.  One, two, three.  That's definitely five seconds. 
[02:30:30]  No.  That was gross.  Thank you.  Don't curse.  What?  What's wrong?  What was that?  Stephanie, why are you cursing?  She said, what the heck is that?  I'm sorry, boy.  You threw poop in there.  There's a nugget.  Someone popped a nugget.  I loved it.  It must have been one of those mysterious ones that kind of go into the tube in the back,  the big pipe, and then come out. 
[02:31:00]  We set up the toilet.  There you are.  Hey, how are you doing?  I'm doing good.  That's great.  I've seen that a lot.  Did you?  Yeah.  This is refreshing a little bit, right?  Yeah, I think they threw a lamb's tongue in there.  No, they didn't.  The lamb's tongue?  No, the lamb's tongue is in the Tupperware.  Huh?  That was a candy bar.  Maybe a candy bar.  It's not so bad.  If you want to thank you for a candy bar, no problem.  The wonderful Caddyshack.  Polo's starring role.  Does Stephanie get a spot in the drum?  She does. 
[02:31:30]  Yes.  You are the second confirmed contestant in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes.  Which will be happening soon.  Huh?  Can I get dressed now?  Uh, yeah.  Just seeing a girl with her head in the toilet just looks so right.  Isn't it great?  Yeah.  You just want to tag her from behind with her head in the toilet?  Someone let us know if they heard the bubbles.  Tell them, make me see before you drown.  Work it, bitch.  We want to make sure they heard the bubbles because you curse right after that and then they  dump, you know, and then Ned Slanders dumps and then you miss the good stuff of the show. 
[02:32:00]  Ned Slanders.  Okie dokie.  Got to dump that one.  Someone on SNFeeback.  Another dumperoonie.  Someone on SNFeeback.  Tell us if you got the bubbles thing.  Come on, what?  Mary Ann from Cleveland.  Real fast.  Hi.  Hey, Mary Ann.  What do you want to do?  Um, well, I called a couple weeks ago and asked you what the Cleveland steamer was.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm willing to make a steamer and Cleveland steam myself.  Huh.  But you're willing to take a dump. 
[02:32:30]  Wow.  Wow, I've read, I've actually bought videos like that.  Winner.  It's about time these girls come to the table for us.  Yeah, let's get rid of the Boston chick.  Thank you, Dan.  There's nothing now.  They heard the bubbles.  All right, Mary Ann, you got to get down here, though.  I got, I got two questions.  Yeah.  I got to know, when is the actual 55-gallon challenge?  Uh, we're another week or so away.  We got to get all the contestants still.  Okay, and then, what is the prize?  Ah. 
[02:33:00]  We'll know by tomorrow.  It's going to be something really good, though.  I'm serious.  But I got to come down tomorrow because it's my only off day.  Perfect.  Come on down tomorrow.  You will not be disappointed, okay?  Yeah.  We'll even give you a prize just for doing that.  And we'll give you gas money.  That's awesome.  All right.  It's an eight-hour drive.  We'll give you some gas money.  Hold on the line.  Rick, get back to the car.  I hope they heard that.  Yeah.  Basically, she'll do a Cleveland steamer and stick her face in it.  Stick her face in her own steamer.  In her own steamer.  How great is that? 
[02:33:30]  Now, Stephanie.  That's good.  Isn't that good?  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, Ronnie and Fez are in the studio.  What a thrill.  And they came up with this little thing because they heard Santa Cain on our show.  Big, big fans.  And we heard Apollo on their show.  Right.  And we figured the two should meet and maybe we could get something going on.  It's like when Adam-12 and Emergency would have those crossover episodes where there'd  be someone injured in a car wreck and Emergency's there. 
[02:34:00]  And then Adam-12 guys pull up and they got to do the police report and you're like,  hey, look at the Adam-12 guys.  It was always a thrill.  Yeah.  So now it's the same kind of thing.  I see it as one of those comic books where the Hulk fights the thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You like that?  Man, if this isn't a match made in heaven.  Look at these two.  Yeah, you like them?  Very cute.  You like him, Sandy?  Yeah.  Are you well and down?  No.  You have a nice tongue, I bet.  Not too big.  Not too well and down. 
[02:34:30]  We don't have to give Sandy the mic anymore because she doesn't say anything worth saying  ever.  Like you think it's going somewhere.  Are you Irish?  Are you well and down?  Let me look at your tongue.  She's just babbling these synapses that are snapping in her head.  You like shrimp?  Yeah, you like shrimp.  Oh, a nice belt buckle.  Did you hear the one about the belt buckle?  Neither did I.  They're doing a thing from the other sister.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is the other sister years later.  The later years.  They want to be grandparents now. 
[02:35:00]  Daniel.  And people still don't believe in abortion.  You're the reason I'm here.  What?  Yeah.  You're the reason I'm here.  Well, here's the deal.  I thought that was Chernobyl.  I want to hear them converse, though, a little bit.  All right, get to know each other.  Go ahead.  Get closer.  Make like we're not here.  Are you married?  That's, yeah.  The fact is, I have a lovely wife at home.  But the fact is, is that I've heard a lot of nice things about her.  Hold on.  We've heard that your wife isn't that lovely there, Paula.  Or not that nice.  Well, come on.  You're very nice. 
[02:35:30]  Thank you.  She has wife.  The thing is, my wife is pretty angry and crazy right now.  And we've had a lot of discussions.  Right now.  And hopefully dying.  And she's got to melt this.  Do we really have a tape of Paula's wife?  Yeah.  That you're giving us here?  Yeah.  She's an alcoholic pill popper.  Let's hear.  All right, here's...  Who hates life.  This is really Paula's wife.  Paula's wife.  Last night when she found out that he was coming here.  Obviously, he gives a s*** more about you than anybody else in s*** humanity.  Why are you cursing on the radio? 
[02:36:00]  You can go to s***.  Why are you cursing on the radio?  That's not happy.  She's a beast.  Wow.  You have to deal with that, Paula?  She's got a liver...  The size of Yankee Stadium.  No, honestly, she's got liver disease and she's drinking.  Let's hope.  Sounds like a real dish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no.  Patriot dish.  The fact is...  Hey, you want Sandy Kane to take her hair off for this?  Oh, that'd be hot. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  No, I...  You know, I don't know.  I'd be interested.  She can take it off, put it back on?  Whatever.  Her hair.  Her real hair.  I haven't seen it.  That would be very interesting.  Hey, Crip Keeper, let me see...  I've never seen your real hair.  We're running out of show, so...  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Just like Carrie from Philly.  She's not wearing underwear.  No, I heard that Norton drinks golden showers.  Is that true?  From humans.  Take off your hair.  Take off your hair.  All right, look, we're running out of time. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, we're running out of time now.  So...  The get-to-know-each-other portion is pretty much done.  Right, it's done.  Sandy, get naked.  Sandy, get naked.  Sandy, rip those clothes off.  And, Ron, why don't you explain what's going to happen here?  I look better in the dark, though.  Sandy, just rip the goddamn clothes off.  We're running out of time.  Come on, sex appeal of dysentery.  Take off everything.  Now, Paulo has offered to come in and make out with Twato.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I was told about it.  In any case, I was told about it.  So we're going to see...  Well, why don't you keep the mic on, Paulo, as he... 
[02:37:30]  He won't show it.  This is my first opportunity to see...  Yeah, as you take a look at Twato for the first time...  By the way, for people in other cities, Twato, who aren't familiar...  Twato is a growth that is on her area, let's just say, the lower region.  A huge growth that is like the size of an ear.  And it's disgusting.  And we call it Twato because of the Quato character from Total Recall growing out of the guy.  And this is just about as big as Quato. 
[02:38:00]  It's a...  Well, whatever.  It's a...  And now, um...  It is...  Paulo, what do you think?  Paulo, what do you think?  I finally have seen it.  And?  And, uh...  I think I can do something with that.  Are you actually going...  Are you actually going to take that and suckle?  Uh, that's what we've been discussing.  Are you excited, though, Paulo?  I did have some questions.  I was told to keep them at a minimum.  But, you know, have you had this checked out in years?  And there's no complaints.  Good enough for us. 
[02:38:30]  It's nothing.  We found pictures in a medical book.  Let's just put it that way.  It's nothing.  It looks like someone threw a wad of gum in her view.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  A big wad.  It seems to resemble a New England state of some sort, but I...  New Hampshire.  Very good.  It's more like a Rhode Island.  Ugh.  All right.  Well, Rhode Island in size.  We were...  I was concerned, somewhat, that it's a healthy thing.  That it's a healthy thing.  That it's a healthy thing.  Is it...  Is it...  I'm going to be healthy.  Why don't you try? 
[02:39:00]  If you get sick, you get sick.  Right.  Hey, I like her philosophy.  Get a mic on this lunatic.  What a great attitude.  I'm just saying, I think he should try to suck it, and then if he gets sick, then we'll  know.  Right.  Like, that's what I told Rock Hudson.  Wow.  That's exactly what I told him.  He wouldn't listen.  Rock, just suck it.  If you get sick, you get sick, and then we'll know.  Let me ask you a question.  Has anybody bit it at any point?  No one else is going to do this, Polo.  Has anybody gotten their mouth around it?  Polo, guys, you're the first. 
[02:39:30]  You're the Lewis and Clark of Tuato.  Get in there.  Somebody just rubbed your face in it.  Someone rubbed your face in it the other day.  Billy.  Billy did.  Billy did.  Oh, God.  Billy did.  I heard something that he has a growth on his forehead.  Whatever.  All right, look.  We're running out of time, Polo.  All right, Polo.  It's a snappy banter.  All right, Polo.  Let's just...  Here we go.  Yeah, I got to kind of get a look.  Polo, get on your knees.  Rick, you're going to have to get out...  There we go.  We got to see bleach ready.  Oh, wait.  All right.  Bleach.  Wait, he wants bleach.  Hold on.  I need a mic over there.  Yeah, put a mic.  There you go. 
[02:40:00]  I am going to vomit if I see this.  Hold on.  I got to get on.  Yeah, take those off, Sandy.  Sandy, take those off.  Sandy, take the goddamn things off.  We're running out of time.  Come on.  Time is of the essence.  You don't need feathers, you...  Don't worry about your feathers.  We know you're heinous.  Nothing you do is going to make it any more or less appealing.  Come on, shining tub lady.  Get it off.  She's in heaven?  I'm at ground zero.  Ground zero.  Room three.  Oh, God.  I hope he's down there. 
[02:40:30]  Someone hurt Sandy.  No, no, no, no.  Stay away.  Sandy.  Anthony.  There's a lady in the room.  I'm standing.  She hurt Danny.  Anthony.  I think he did it to himself.  Sandy Kane is removing her bottoms that she borrowed from Pedro Morales.  Hey, hey, hold on.  Those cases are completely in my way.  I need you to bring one way and go.  Anthony.  Yes.  I am literally a foot away.  Come on.  She painted Twato today to match her yellow tights.  It's yellow.  Right yellow.  Right yellow.  Oh, my God.  All right. 
[02:41:00]  Sandy.  Sandy.  Don't talk.  Don't say that.  Hey, bitch.  Oh, God.  Would you stop it?  Don't say it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Don't say a word.  Don't say anything else.  Just leave.  Now, follow.  Sandy.  No.  Sandy.  How about you just shut up?  Get the dog.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  God, is she.  You just want to punch her in the face as hard as you can? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, gag her.  Oh, and ain't not to brag.  Oh, she's quiet.  Oh, she just put the toilet paper somewhere.  Oh, God.  It's too close to Opie.  Look.  Hey, show you what you're talking about.  Oh.  Oh, Opie's vomiting now.  Oh, great.  Opie's vomiting.  He really is.  A host is there.  You know, we try to do something nice like a make-out session with Twato, and she's ruining it.  She's wrecking the whole thing.  Sandy, shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Sandy Kane is actually the third wheel between Polo and Twato. 
[02:42:00]  All right, Polo, if you would please get to know the lovely Twato.  Here I go.  All right, Sandy, move your hand.  All right, I'm right here.  All right, move your hand.  Put your hands to your side.  Right, remember.  All right.  Oh, hey, here we go.  All right, he's going in, Ant.  He's going in.  Here we go.  Very wide mouth.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's got it.  He's nibbling.  He's nibbling.  No.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow. 
[02:42:30]  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  That is the most disgusting thing ever.  He chipped the paint.  He chipped the paint, Antoine.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  You want more?  Ow.  She's asking me to bite it off.  No.  God damn it.  Bite it.  Bite it.  If I bite it off.  Tongue it.  Tongue it.  Don't bite it.  Don't bite it.  Don't bite it.  Don't bite it.  Don't bite it.  Just flick it.  Flick it.  Oh, God.  He's got his teeth in there.  Oh, God.  I'm going to bite it.  Oh, he's tugging. 
[02:43:00]  He's tugging.  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  Of course you don't feel it.  It's dead skin.  Come on.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  I've got a dry mouth disease right now.  Oh, my.  They're arguing.  I've got a dry mouth disease right now.  They're arguing over there.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  No, you didn't even do it.  Oh, Sandy, we got pictures of it.  Where's the bleach?  Ah.  Yeah, he didn't do it, but he wants to choke bleach right now. 
[02:43:30]  Rick, I don't even want to look at the picture.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  He's doing it more.  That sounds so listening.  Okay, okay.  Enough.  Sandy's eyes are rolling back in her head.  She's in ecstasy.  The bleach solution.  No, he ain't going into the middle there.  How's it smell?  Yeah, I know.  Ronnie?  Yeah.  We could top the Twato thing.  No.  No.  No, it can't be.  Oh, God.  Get that camera away from me. 
[02:44:00]  Let me see.  Oh, yes, Sandy.  He didn't do it.  Look at that shot.  Is that going up on OpenEthony.com?  Oh, God.  No, we just have to, you know, cube out the area, and we're all set.  Ronnie.  Yeah.  Twato has friends.  No.  Around back.  Oh.  I don't know what it can work out here, but.  Yeah.  Is it Butto's?  Butto's.  Yeah.  Where are they?  Right around the balloon knot.  Didn't we name Twato's friends?  Is there something there? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, but I don't remember.  She called it her roid.  Yeah.  But it ain't.  Hey, Sandy, how about you?  Shut up and don't talk, because you always make us that we have to dump out.  Just stop it.  Stop.  Holy S.  I'm going to.  Don't you just like.  You know, my fish couldn't get hard enough to want to smack you sometimes.  You get so.  You get so.  You're so stupid.  Shut up.  Don't say anything.  Put something in her mouth.  My baby.  Ah. 
[02:45:00]  Shut up.  Don't talk.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Paul.  Paul.  Wait a minute.  Oh, God.  It's romantic.  That I'd like to see.  Uh-oh.  Go ahead.  Drop to your knees, Sandy.  I have a little shrinkage right now.  So what?  He's nervous.  It's to be expected.  It's to be expected. 
[02:45:30]  I don't know if they're on the right side of the right side of the right side of the right.  He'd rather kiss Twato.  Yeah.  He'd rather kiss Twato than have.  All right.  So you want him to go around back?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Paulo, would you listen?  Sandy Kane.  Sandy.  You got the thing, the action happening.  Now, don't even talk.  You got some action just like Twato happening around the other side.  We want Paulo to also play with those.  First of all, first of all, I did not get any kind of a wash.  That's coming. 
[02:46:00]  A wash, but it would be good now.  Oh, you want a drink?  No, I just need a...  Yeah, you need a whisk.  Will you give him the bleach?  Give him a drink or something.  Give him a drink.  Give him a drink of bleach.  Give him a drink of Drano.  Give him a bleach.  Carlo, something happened here.  Give him a drink.  I'm Irish.  I like a little bleach.  I think I'd bring him around here and let you bums get involved.  And on the other side, you know, at least this was varnished.  And, you know, it had the shellac.  Right, you're fine.  No, we're going right around.  Sandy.  What did Kurt Cobain say? 
[02:46:30]  Assume the position.  Sandy, assume the position.  What is it?  What are you drinking, Paulo?  Better not drink bleach.  Paulo, what are you drinking?  He's drinking bleach.  Spin it.  Spit that bleach.  What are you spitting?  Oh, that's Clorox.  Let me see.  He is chugging Clorox.  No way.  It smells like a people's.  He just swinkled.  Look, look.  Are you out of your frigging mind?  He just swinkled.  This is the biggest collection of retards.  I love you guys. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, Sandy, look, we're really running out of time, so assume the position.  Yeah.  All right?  Assume the position.  Get the camera in there, stinky.  Well, you know what I mean.  Get a good shot.  All right.  Just go over.  Go ahead.  Drop.  All right.  Hold on.  Drop.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  He's going around back.  Oh, on the console.  He's going around back.  On the console.  This is great.  Move up this way, Sandy.  Yeah, turn this way.  Wait, wait.  Apollo, you come around.  Oh, my God.  Jesus. 
[02:47:30]  This is the most disgusting sight I've ever seen in my life.  I've got to get over there.  And you've got to take a look at this.  Apollo, you've got to get in deep.  Right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well.  Oh, my God.  You want to check out the area first?  See what you're going for?  I have seen Satan.  It's green.  Apparently, it's green.  It's green.  It's green.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:48:00]  The abyss.  Even Fezzy's disgusted.  Oh, God.  I am disgusted.  All right, well, Apollo, it is now your turn to, well, do the balloon knot action.  Yeah, I mean, I'd like to take a little more professional attitude.  We don't have time for professionalism.  The man is a professional.  A little dignity, please.  A little dignity.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Go ahead, Apollo.  Apollo.  No, no.  You've got to do the same thing you did with Quato back there. 
[02:48:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, go ahead.  Apollo, come on.  I'll start with the nose.  I'm disgusted.  Apollo.  Apollo, Apollo.  There you go.  Sandy, open.  Open.  Oh, my God.  His nose is in there.  Oh, my God.  You're insane.  Go ahead, Apollo.  Oh, my God.  All right, the nose is very deep.  There it goes.  Get the mouth in there, Apollo.  I think that accomplished what we were going after.  Oh, my God.  Dance man.  Oh, my God.  I cannot. 
[02:49:00]  I cannot even tell you.  Oh, God.  Wow.  I just poured bleach into my eyes.  And I'm feeling better.  As she said, I'm a very nice guy.  And that's what the dominatrix said last year.  Right.  The one I'll be chased out of here in tears.  Tell me, remember.  You know what?  I hate to do this.  We have to take a quick break, and we'll wrap up this mess.  Yes.  No more warts?  There might be one more growth we should exploit. 
[02:49:30]  Somewhere on there.  Oh, my God.  The whole thing.  He dug in there.  And believe me, it looks like someone took a hatchet to a Wookiee back there.  Sandy, what the hell is going on?  You ever heard of a depilatory or something?  What?  What do you use?  A depilatory?  It's hairy and awful.  It's a big, hairy mess.  I've never seen a green one.  It was green.  It looked like a Venus flytrap.  It looked pretty good to me.  All right.  Well, listen, we'll wrap up next. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Ron and Fez.  Oh, my God.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  We're back with the O&A Show.  Oh.  We've got to thank Ron and Fez for introducing Paul O to Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  That was a match that was just waiting to happen. 
[02:50:30]  It's what they call kismet, I think.  It was kismet.  I just witnessed Paul O sucking and licking and kind of playing with it between his teeth,  gently nibbling, gently nibbling, canoodling.  Canoodling with it.  Yes.  With Twato.  With Sandy Kane's Twato.  Then on top of that, he downs Clorox to get the better taste out of his mouth.  And then, in one of the most horrific things to ever take place on this program, he spun 
[02:51:00]  her around and did the same thing, canoodling, little lapping, little nibbling at the caboose.  It looked like a dirty baby's diaper.  It was green.  It was green.  Green peas.  Green peas.  She was against the console.  Everyone else went around by the CDs that we got on the wall to get a look directly into the face of evil. 
[02:51:30]  Right into Medusa's face.  I saw Satan.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Looking Mohammed Atta right in the eye.  Oh, my God.  The horror.  And then, it was green.  And it was so...  There were so many brambles and bushes growing.  And then, deep within, the sickening crevasse, there it was. 
[02:52:00]  More friends of Twato.  Right on the rim.  And Paulo got a good one.  He got a good one.  He dug right in.  He stuck that nose right in.  Das dupe, yeah.  Das dupe, yeah.  Looked like when you give a little kitten some milk.  A little kitten milk.  What did they do?  That's what he was doing.  All right. 
[02:52:30]  Well, where's Ron and Fez?  We want to thank them for that.  And, of course.  We're going to continue here in New York.  It's kind of a, you know, we're doing a cross thing now.  I think Ron and Fez are up next.  We know that.  And Paulo's going to be on.  And I believe Santa Cain's going to stick around.  See what else you can get out of the two, right?  Paulo just told me that the back tastes better than the front.  Oh, my God.  Did he say that?  Yeah.  How sick is that?  And a blind taste test.  Paulo?  It's a blind taste test.  They did ask me for a preference. 
[02:53:00]  He smells so bleachy in his mouth.  I know.  We gave Paulo the back door instead of the front.  Let's see his response as he licks on these crystals that are forming.  Yeah.  His wife's going, you know, Paulo doesn't taste my warts so long.  Oh, God.  What's she got?  You know, we've seen some sick things on the show.  I think that put it over the top.  That was so disturbing.  The guy's eating puke in Boston.  Oh, he's spitting.  Thank you.  But I think this beat the guys eating puke.  I don't think we can beat that. 
[02:53:30]  Guys, what's going on on the program tonight?  Paulo's going to be with you.  Paulo's going to be getting...  You're doing some Oscar talk.  Yeah, and he's getting a tattoo that says Twato.  So we all remember probably the date.  Put the date on there, yeah.  Yeah.  Because years from now, you're going to want to know, yeah, I was there, and oh, my God,  it's been 20 years already, you know.  You're going to look back.  You know, you got the tattoo artist coming in?  Yeah.  He's got to get a little diagram of the actual Twato.  We'll try.  Oh, you think? 
[02:54:00]  Maybe a nice little sketch of that.  Yeah, sketch of that.  His eyes are watering.  He's got to bleach in his eyes.  He's got to bleach in his eyes.  He's got to bleach in his eyes.  I was just tearing up.  Oh, the memories already.  Yeah.  Seems like yesterday.  You guys want Santa Cana to stick around?  Not really.  Isn't she the most annoying?  Yeah.  I think she'll get Paulo a...  Paulo, do you want one?  I think she's a nice girl.  She doesn't have bottom teeth.  Yeah, her bottom teeth are missing.  It's nice. 
[02:54:30]  Hey, dentist.  I hate dentists.  The dentist did this to me.  It's like, what, did he hit you with a friggin' monkey wrench?  What's wrong, Paul?  I think that would be inappropriate for a marriage.  Yeah, that's inappropriate.  Putting your face in that horror.  That is...  Just a little bit of decorum.  It would actually be more appropriate to dress up like a clown in Chicago and rape children.  Yeah, you're a mess.  All right.  I don't know about that.  All right.  Ned Flanders took care of that one, Jimmy. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, I was...  Did he?  Yeah.  It was a serial killer reference.  I know, but...  That's...  Golly D. Willikers.  Oh, yeah, I can't mention that.  The FCC, I hope...  Don't stick.  All right, we've got to go.  Ron and Fez, we're going to fight night tomorrow, if you don't mind.  Right.  Yes.  We're going to see you guys out there.  We're going to fight night in Farmingdale.  Norman, would you please come out, though, if you'd like to, or you've got to be...  I would love to, man.  Thank you, but I have sex.  He doesn't like leaving Manhattan either.  I say.  Who's fighting?  Everybody.  We've got to go.  Oh, the headliner, though.  Yeah.  I can't wait. 
[02:55:30]  But we're going.  Can they get tickets or no?  No.  Oh, boy.  No.  Will there be girls there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Look at Ben freaking out.  All right, Ron and Fez next in New York, and we'll see you guys tomorrow at 3.  Hopefully more girls will come down tomorrow to try out for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  But, um...  You did.  I got you, Obie, again.  Win in New York City.  Stay at the Park Central, New York, 7th Avenue, near Broadway Theatres and Central Park.  1-800-346-1359.
