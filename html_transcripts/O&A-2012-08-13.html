<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on Monday, August 13th, 2012, began with a discussion about a knife attack in Times Square and the subsequent police shooting.  This segued into a recap of their recent live show in Chicago, describing a large, enthusiastic, and chaotic crowd, including multiple instances of audience members vomiting.  They detailed their Chicago experiences, including a riverboat tour and a post-show hangout with fans lasting an hour and a half.  A significant portion of the show focused on E-Rock's revenge on Opie by consuming expensive items from his minibar, including a $25 bottle of Swarovski-crystal-encrusted water and $30 gummy bears.  Troy Kwan’s absence due to a canceled United Airlines flight provided further comedic fodder, with Anthony recounting his near-expulsion from a flight due to a wobbly-legged walk. Opie recounted a high-stakes blackjack session at the Horseshoe Casino, resulting in significant winnings and losses, and culminating in a broken hand. Jim Norton’s frustration with SiriusXM only reimbursing half of his travel expenses for the Chicago trip, despite the broadcast’s promotional value, was a recurring theme.

The show then delved into a critique of the London Olympics closing ceremony, focusing on the musical acts (Madness, Pet Shop Boys, Spice Girls), Russell Brand’s hosting, and Beady Eye’s (formerly Oasis) performance, with particular disdain directed at Liam Gallagher.  Extended audio clips from the Chicago live show highlighted the vomiting incidents, including a man repeatedly inducing vomiting in another attendee ("Iraq"), resulting in a chaotic and extremely graphic scene.  The discussion further explored the Gallagher brothers’ acrimonious relationship and Oasis' breakup,  branching into discussions about other bands' reunion attempts (ABBA, Led Zeppelin), and the hosts’ disdain for modern art, punctuated by a profane discussion of a hyper-realistic painting of Times Square.  This transitioned into a comedic anecdote from Jim Brewer, followed by recounting their attempt to recreate scenes from *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* in Chicago, highlighting E-Rock's struggles with finding specific paintings.

A significant portion focused on their Chicago *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* reenactment attempts,  which were hampered by location changes and communication difficulties with photographers.  This included details about their visit to other Chicago attractions, with Sam expressing his dislike for tourist traps and Roland's assertive seat-saving tactics.  The show featured a guest appearance by Adam Ferrara and Rutledge Wood from *Top Gear*, along with a live read for CougarLife.com.  Anecdotes about the *Top Gear* team's experiences with rental cars, their penchant for damage, and their unconcerned attitudes concluded this segment, along with discussions of future broadcast locations (Toronto, Austin, Seattle).

The show then shifted to a discussion about Volkswagen buses and Beetles, their history, and their association with criminal activity.  A guest appeared briefly, mentioning an upcoming appearance on Jay Leno's show.  The hosts showed pictures of small cars, recounting a trip involving various small cars and stunts in a BMW M5. They also discussed driving muscle cars in the L.A. River, which included a humorous encounter with a naked homeless man. Following the guest's departure, the show detailed the dismissal of an intern, "Uncle Kevi," due to laziness and incompetence. This led to a broader discussion of the internship program, its challenges, and a plug for the Opie and Anthony internship program.

The final segment focused on Sal's perceived laziness and lack of work ethic, contrasted with the diligence of other interns like Troy and a caller, Nick, motivated by Opie's pep talk.  Anecdotes about a ruined sound effect and Sal's supposed "creative burnout" (without actually quitting) were highlighted.  A caller, Billy, expressed a changed opinion of Sam, while another, Nick, recounted how Opie's pep talk motivated him to attend a work meeting.  The segment included a commercial break for Steven Singer Jewelers, using the ironic website address IHateStevenSinger.com, and concluded with Rob receiving an MVP award for his work.  Numerous callers participated, offering opinions on Sal’s work performance.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  That is not good. 
[00:03:30]  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you somehow find this offensive, just don't listen. But my guess is, you'll be sticking  around.  Let's do this.  It's going down.  Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King, welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's satellite radio.  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best. 
[00:04:00]  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  Yay.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it? 
[00:04:30]  Everything you are about to hear is real.  My nipples are kind of hard.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Let's get the show on the road.  I know. 
[00:05:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hi, everybody.  We're live Monday, August 13th, 2012.  Yes.  Got to prove that to people.  They're like, there's no way they're going to be doing a show on Monday.  Back in New York.  We're going to take Monday off.  We're black in New York City.  Good old New York City.  Ah, yeah.  Where they killed a guy right outside our studio, basically.  Oh, well.  Two or three blocks from here, they shot a guy. 
[00:05:30]  And everyone filmed it.  Yeah, well, there's a guy that put together, right?  Well, there's a couple of videos.  Well, most of them stink.  How do you miss that, you dummies?  Who knows how to fucking hold a goddamn camera phone?  What have we got, a knife wielder?  Yeah, a guy was roaming around with a knife in Times Square.  I guess he was smoking some of the evil or something.  Was it bath salts?  Maybe.  Cops wanted to talk to him.  Yeah.  Have a little chit-chat with him about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They pulled a knife out. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Started chasing people around.  Yeah.  And the papers are amazed that people filmed this thing.  Why wouldn't they?  Why wouldn't they?  The guy has a knife, first of all.  You know, the knife wielder's not going to get anywhere near them.  Yeah.  And the cops are basically not even chasing it, kind of just walking down block after block  in Times Square.  Yeah, they were slowly, like, backing him up.  He was walking backwards, and they're walking toward him.  They all had their guns out on him.  And everyone else had their cell phones filming away. 
[00:06:30]  And wasn't he begging them to shoot him, too?  He was like, shoot me, shoot me.  And then, you know.  All right.  Then you get that other thing where, all right, they said he lunged at him or something.  Didn't they mace him first, too, and it didn't work?  Yeah, they tried some pepper spray.  That didn't work.  Why do you got to kill the guy?  I mean, I'm.  Because he's a fucking idiot.  But then we take the idiot in Colorado alive.  Yeah, well.  They couldn't figure out something in Colorado?  I guess he complied. 
[00:07:00]  Well, yeah, but no one knows that.  Yeah, I know.  I'm old school, man.  If no one's looking, no one knows that shit.  Yeah, they should have killed him, too.  Do the right thing, Colorado.  This guy was arrested for this also in 2008.  Oh, really?  Chasing people around with a screwdriver.  Oh, that's good.  He spent 40 days in Rikers for that.  Right.  40 days.  Yeah, this guy.  Yeah, I know.  Just a problem.  He'd just shoot him.  If he would have fucking killed a tourist or something, there would have been somebody  that was just here trying to have a good time getting killed.  So, fuck him. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  But why is, like, the papers amazed that people would film that?  Of course you would.  You're not going to run away from that.  Well.  If he had, like, a, you know, a fucking gun or something, sure.  But the odds are you're safe if there's a, I don't know, there was at least a dozen  cops, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  A dozen cops and a guy with a knife, that's easy.  Imagine how fast he could just lunge at anybody and stab them.  Like, how quickly that can happen.  It's just a run and, what do you think? 
[00:08:00]  No?  Really?  Not the videos I was watching.  He could just run into a crowd.  So, you're amazed that people were filming?  No.  I know they would, but it doesn't take away from the danger there.  And the guy, the guy was obviously a threat.  Nah.  The NYPD, they're good.  Yeah.  They had him.  They certainly did.  That's why it makes it really good for everyone else to film.  A load of holes in them.  Take that back to Idaho.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  You got a nice video of a guy getting killed in Times Square. 
[00:08:30]  A vacation film people are going to want to watch.  Finally, something interesting happened in Times Square.  In your home movies.  Right.  Because that Times Square stinks.  Oh, here's where the NYPD shot an authentic black person in Times Square.  Check it out.  I highly recommend for the people that, you know, you come to New York for the first time,  do Times Square for an hour.  Don't spend your whole time in Times Square.  There's nothing there.  Nah.  There really is nothing there.  You could do it in an hour, tops. 
[00:09:00]  Then spread out and really look at what New York City has to offer.  Yeah.  But, yeah, so that, I guess the family now is coming forward and saying, hey, the police  weren't justified in doing this.  I don't think, I mean, you understand they're bumming out about it and everything, but I  don't think the family is a good judge of whether their family member should have been  shot or not.  You know.  If the guy did it prior, obviously he has issues.  Got some issues.  I wonder if the family, you know, tried to take care of his issues over the years. 
[00:09:30]  And then you got more of these people that just don't understand anything and they think  they're like, why didn't they just shoot the knife out of his hand?  Why didn't they shoot him in the leg?  Shoot to wound.  It's not part of your training.  You're trained to shoot to kill.  When you pull the gun out and you're going to use it, it's time to kill somebody.  And by the way, why should they, like, the middle of the body, the torso, is the thickest 
[00:10:00]  part?  Yeah.  Do you really want them risking firing and hitting someone behind him?  Right.  Because they're aiming for a flailing arm or leg?  Right.  They were absolutely right to shoot this guy.  Fuck him.  Plus you kill him and then maybe the next time a guy has a knife and he wants to wield it  around, he might think twice.  He'll be like, well, I shouldn't say shoot me because they will comply.  That's what I hope for.  Yeah.  Maybe it stops the next guy.  Go for him.  Well, stats have proven that.  Yeah.  Well, there's always the hope that maybe one or two guys out there are like, you know 
[00:10:30]  what?  I'm not going to be the knife wielder.  Statistics.  What?  Statistics.  Statistics.  Statistics.  Ah, fuck.  Chicago ruled.  Oh, man.  Fucking Chicago ruled.  Great time.  Man, Chicago is a nice little secret, huh?  Is it a secret?  In a weird way, I think it is because it's like tucked away and I don't know.  I've never been to Chicago and I like traveling around America.  I love it.  I haven't been there either.  And it's a city that's just pushed up there and it's just has its own thing happening. 
[00:11:00]  And it's a real city, first of all.  And it's a real city.  You're right.  Which is like, we've gone to a lot of cities and you look and especially you're a little  jaded coming from New York because it's like, oh, well, I guess to them it's a city.  Cleveland.  Then you go to Cleveland.  Even Philly.  It's like.  Philly?  Yeah, it's it's it's a big town, Philly.  Come on.  Philly's in the shadow of New York.  Even L.A. isn't like a to me, it's not a city.  They got the downtown area. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, but it's not like it doesn't feel like a city when you're there.  Chicago is definitely Chicago is a city.  It's got a big skyline.  It's got like a city feel to it, you know, traffic shit like that.  So, yeah, it was kind of cool going to a city that, you know, is a city.  Right.  But it's it's great, man.  The people were all so nice up there.  It's great.  We had a huge turnout.  Oh, it was amazing.  We weren't sure about.  So we want to thank everyone that showed up. 
[00:12:00]  That was great.  Great time.  Really, really good time.  It's nice meeting everyone after the broadcast.  Oh, yeah.  We hung around for what?  Like an hour, hour and a half.  Yeah.  Signing shit, taking pictures and just laughing our balls off with the people up there.  They were a nice audience, man.  Really cool.  Our crowds are rowdy.  Like they're not like a like I think like Ron and Fez are.  They're able to do a more traditional show with their audiences.  Yeah.  Because I think their live appearances are.  I mean, they're great crowds, but they're just a different.  There's a different bloodlust, like a different vibe. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Our crowds show up.  And it's we have to structure a certain kind of show because they're they're rowdy.  I mean, they're standing there drinking and they want you want blood.  Yeah, they do.  Man, basically want blood.  And it reminds me of a Jim Brewer stand up show.  Like everybody's just kind of standing there waiting.  Like I don't know how Jim would do that.  Those are hard to do.  There's a lot of pressure because they're expecting something.  Yeah.  Something over the top.  And we certainly delivered.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  I saw a couple of those people the next night.  I did this gig. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  And at the signing afterwards, we sign after we do the with the talent already and addicted  to the shows and the big guy who puked.  I saw and a couple of the other people.  And it's weird to see them in normal mode.  I really enjoyed yesterday.  You know, yeah, yeah.  24 hours ago, he had his fucking fingers down his fat throat.  He's vomiting into a cup.  He knew he had to deliver for the Opie and Anthony crowd.  He had to deliver.  I love how you just say that like it's no big deal.  You know, the guy that puked.  Yeah, that's normal.  I guess we do.  You do get jaded a little bit. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the only thing that the show was missing was kind of that female thing.  Yeah.  We needed to at least see some nice cleavage or a nice ass on that stage.  But besides that, I think it was really a huge success.  Yeah.  Huge success.  Yeah, we should have that next time.  I mean, besides from that, it was really.  There's a lot of girls there that were good.  Like cute.  Yeah, there were a lot, right?  What the hell is that about?  We're starting to draw some girls.  How the hell did that happen?  I think we're showing our sensitive side.  Oh, I doubt it. 
[00:14:00]  More and more.  Just a little bit.  We're giving them a peek and they're like, all right, we could go to a live broadcast.  Man.  Yeah, it was fun.  And then, God, people don't even understand.  Look, even I can't drink that much Jägermeister.  Holy shit.  You know, they start coming up with, hey, do a shot, do a shot.  It's like, yeah, A shot's good.  It just turns into three and four.  We're in.  Wow.  Jäger's.  That was fun.  You like Jäger.  I used to like Jäger. 
[00:14:30]  I don't mind Jäger for doing shots.  You can't get, like, if you get drunk off of it, you're going to be puking up black shit.  That's a bad hangover.  That's a bad hangover, Jäger, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I remember it from my Buffalo days.  That was the shot of choice.  Yeah.  Is that a vodka or a whiskey?  It's very licorice-y.  It's a licorice-y thing.  Sugary.  Yeah, very sugary.  That sugar will fucking give you a hangover.  Yeah, it looks like stuff that the zombies puke up in zombie movies.  Yeah.  Black stuff.  I've seen it, but I've never.  Is that like Goldschlager?  No.  No, no. 
[00:15:00]  That's a little more peppermint-y.  This is licorice-y.  Like black licorice.  Yeah, yeah.  And it gets you fucked up.  Yep.  Fucked up.  I did the riverboat tour with the guys.  How was that?  On Saturday.  That was awesome.  That city has a lot of history, man.  A lot of history.  Learning about how the river caught fire during the Great Chicago Fire.  The river caught fire.  Yeah.  It's pretty rough.  Yeah.  I said that correctly.  That's a polluted river.  They said the river was so polluted that it actually caught fire. 
[00:15:30]  It was so polluted.  And that's how the fire was able to spread from either west to east or east to west.  I don't know which way.  The good old days.  I would assume maybe it went from west to east because of the winds.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  And then there's a whole park that was built because that's all the debris from the fire.  They just dumped it in the lake.  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  And that was landfill.  So now that's a huge park.  And then you learn that they reversed the river in Chicago to take care of the pollution. 
[00:16:00]  The river was so polluted they couldn't use it anymore.  So they got the bright idea well over 100 years ago, maybe you can look it up, Sam, that they actually reversed the river to solve the pollution problem.  My question is, is it reversed to this day?  I don't know.  Or did they do it just for a little while?  I don't know.  I don't know.  How did that clean up?  It just dragged all the pollution out of it?  Oh, yeah.  Just dumped it in Lake Michigan.  Here, Lake Michigan.  Enjoy our fucking polluted river. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  How long did it take to river tour?  About an hour and a half.  It was great.  You ended up on Lake Michigan and you got to see the skyline, which is just massive.  I mean, I've never been there.  I didn't know what to expect.  Yeah.  Chicago's a beautiful city.  It's really nice.  Very cool.  And I know people are going to laugh, but it's like a secret in a weird way.  You don't hear a lot of people going, I'm going to Chicago, unless you're sort of close to that area.  I mean, I hear people all the time, I'm going to Washington, I'm going to Boston, I'm going to L.A., I'm going to all these other cities. 
[00:17:00]  You don't hear Chicago mentioned as much with the rest of the cities.  I would go there.  I'd go to Chicago to hang out for a couple days.  I've done that before.  It's a great fucking city.  They're also known for such brutal fucking winters that, like, you know, people don't, I guess during the winter, no one wants to fucking go there.  Right.  Like, just hang out, fucking freezing and crazy-ass wind off the lake.  Yeah, that's true, too.  You know why it's called the second city? 
[00:17:30]  Why?  I always thought it was because it was in the shadow of New York.  Like, New York is the big city, and then, you know, oh, well, we got our city.  Well, I guess we're the second city.  But it's because it's the second city built there.  They had to rebuild the whole fucking city after the fire.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  I didn't either.  Just dump things you pick up on.  I had no idea.  I thought it was just like, they were like, all right, we're second.  It's literally the second city that was there.  Yeah.  Oh, that's fucked up.  Yeah, they pretty much had to rebuild from scratch. 
[00:18:00]  What do you got on the river thing, Sam?  Anything?  Of interest or no?  It was done in 1900.  Wow.  1900, they figured out how to reverse a river to clean up the pollution.  Well, you just lift up the other side of the city.  Of course.  And then it drains backwards.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm sure it was.  Because they had to build.  I heard they built, like, a really deep trench or something.  And somehow that made the water go deeper.  And then.  They basically built a river that reversed the flow of where everything was going.  So they sent all their polluted water to St. Louis. 
[00:18:30]  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  That's great.  Well, then the riverboat guy goes.  He had a terrific line.  He goes, well, in the end, though, even though St. Louis got our polluted water, they got us back in the end.  And that is called Budweiser.  What a hoot that guy sounds like.  He couldn't wait to deliver that line.  I'm like, oh, boy.  And then he goes, just kidding.  Just kidding, everyone.  Just kidding. 
[00:19:00]  Just kidding.  Did you crack up when he said Budweiser?  Yeah, I gave him a noxious laugh from the back of the boat.  But I guess so.  Oh, I guess the trench.  Now, I'm starting to figure it out in my own head.  It's a deep trench.  So now the water is basically hitting a back wall.  So now it's like, okay, now we've got to kind of go turn it around.  Yeah.  And then it started flowing the other way and took out all the pollution.  Wow.  That Mrs. O'Leary's fire?  Is it?  Is that really happening?  It started with a cow or something?  Yeah.  Is that true, you think? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  That sounds a little mythical, but who knows?  Cow knocked over a fucking light.  The old bitch's farm caught on fire.  And the next thing you know, the fucking river's got to be backed up.  What are you building your city out of that?  The whole thing burns down.  Oh, my God.  It was like fucking just kindling.  Yeah.  Not even just wood.  No, just dry fucking wood.  Yeah, because, you know, some wood will survive, you know, long enough for you to have a chance  to put it out, I guess.  Paint the buildings with gasoline. 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  And they had lit flames everywhere.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everything had to have a lit torch in it.  Yeah.  But, I mean, that just can't happen, you know, nowadays.  No.  You will not see a whole city burned down.  How bad was that fire?  God forbid, nuclear explosion or something.  What?  How long did that fire burn for?  Still going.  Yeah, they're just about done putting it out.  It burned from Sunday to a Tuesday.  Two days?  In 1971.  That's it?  And destroyed...  1971? 
[00:20:30]  I thought it was older.  1870.  Oh.  Two days.  And destroyed 3.3 square miles.  Man.  In two days.  In two days.  Two and a half days.  What the fuck was the fire department doing?  I don't know.  They had that bucket brigade.  Ah, Quigley.  Trying to smother it with leaves.  Dry leaves.  Throwing dry leaves on it.  Realize that didn't work.  You know, someone fucked up.  I would love to know that guy's name.  Someone fucked up and thought, ah, this isn't that big of a deal.  I remember years ago...  Let's finish our beers, boys, and then we'll come over there. 
[00:21:00]  I was doing a comedy festival in Chicago years ago, and I was doing a show with this guy,  J. Scott Holman, and I believe he wasn't having a good set, and he made some reference  to how grateful he was to the cow burning down the city.  It's a very funny, mean reference he did, because he was bombing.  Sounds it.  Very mean.  It's amazing when you're bombing, you'll pull out anything.  Just try to save yourself.  Yeah, just to insult them.  E-Rock got me back for all the years of abuse.  Wow.  Step on your foot. 
[00:21:30]  He pulled a fast one when I was in Chicago.  He got me back.  Pulled a fast one.  Yeah, it was incredible.  You want to tell him?  Oh, my God.  This is not after show, E-Rock, is it?  What happened, E-Rock?  E-Rock, he got me back finally.  Tell the guys.  I thought Sam would be more excited to tell the story.  That's why I was like, you tell him to Sam.  Why didn't you tell it to us on the air?  Did you just say you tell him in the headphones?  No, he just looked at me and pointed. 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  He said, hey, that's for you, buddy.  No, and I hope he said, you want to tell him, and then we all were quiet waiting for  you to say something, and you're pointing at Sam instead of saying something on the air.  He got me back, man.  He pulled a fast one.  Well, um.  He doesn't have any confidence in the story.  That's why he's trying to get me to tell him.  But you got me back.  You might as well tell it, guys.  This is your day to shine.  So we went up to Ope's room, and he was packing to leave, and while he was doing some other 
[00:22:30]  things, I opened up stuff from his minibar that was quite costly.  Oh.  Did you drink it or eat it, or just open it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He said, oh, yeah.  A $25 bottle of water.  He was sitting there.  A water.  They had this bottle of water that was bling water.  Yes.  And it's this individual serving of water, but it has Swarovski crystals on the bottle.  Right.  It's just a bottle of water.  It's like Poland Spring, but it's blue glass. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  And it's $25 for the bottle of water.  Oh, my God.  I saw that.  I'm glad I didn't open that.  Yeah.  So he's sitting there, and he's just looking at it, and I was like, I dare you to open  it.  And he goes, no, I'm not going to open it.  And I was like, E-Rock, think about the time you were left at Giant Stadium.  Oh, man.  I was like, think about the time you had to find your own way home.  Slow revenge.  No kidding.  And he said, you know what?  And he started opening it up with his mouth.  Oh, man.  That and a $30 bottle of Trump gummy bears.  There was $30 gummy bears there? 
[00:23:30]  He took some cashews and some of those gold bars.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they were chocolate.  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  They weren't real gold bars.  I found some gold bars that I came to.  I cost him $30,000.  That's pretty funny.  He must have cost me about, I don't know, $60.  Yeah, you went, he went, I hope he went into the bathroom.  It was crazy.  And E-Rock went wild.  Yeah, he went wild.  Well, boy, you showed him.  He went, uh, pig wild. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  He got me back, though.  And he was sniffing up his luggage.  And then Roland, who threw the cashews in the lake thinking that was hilarious?  I think Eric did.  Yeah.  I heard Roland giggle in there.  Yeah.  But he got me back.  You hear that?  Yeah, I heard that.  That was crazy.  It's crazy.  All right.  E-Rock.  Thus why I pointed to Sam.  Thus then.  Good one. 
[00:24:30]  I want to see, uh, Troy Kwan's walking down the hall.  I want to see how his Chicago trip was.  Yeah, how was that?  He was such a wild man, we barely saw him.  I know.  Yeah, he's out of control, man.  I was thinking I was going to see him, but, uh.  Troy, how was your Chicago trip?  My God.  Must have been partying the whole time.  Yeah.  Fair-mouthing your country and playing rock music, I'll bet.  Your party was so crazy, I didn't even see you.  Yeah.  Did you enjoy Chicago?  I didn't make it.  What?  What?  What?  Huh?  But, but the broadcast was completely fine.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Well, they're good.  I mean, more than fine.  Don't say fine.  Do a great broadcast.  Exemplary.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the word.  Wow, you fucked up for future trips.  For future trips.  Now they always have this.  Oh, that's all right, man.  What can you guys look around and go, wait, Troy didn't make it to Chicago, and the live broadcast  was, dare I say, almost perfect.  Without a hitch.  Right.  And there's absolutely, will be no reason to have you on the next one, which sucks because  you're a fun guy.  Yeah, yeah.  It sounded great.  What happened?  Well, I got a text from Sam at like 5.30 on Thursday, and he was like, your flight's 
[00:25:30]  canceled.  I'm like, you mean Wednesday or Thursday?  Thursday.  No, when I was there on Thursday.  Oh, you were coming Friday morning.  Friday morning.  Oh, right.  Damn.  Sam was like, your flight's canceled.  I'm like, well, why is Sam texting this to me?  I thought he was just fucking with me.  Yeah.  And then Kenny texted me maybe like 20 minutes later.  He was like, your flight's canceled.  And I was like, okay.  Like, what do I do?  So I'm sitting there like, and I'm in the middle of trying to sign a lease.  So you know what's involved with signing a lease to a new apartment. 
[00:26:00]  It's a fucking nightmare.  Well, it's a pen and about five minutes a year of your time.  No, it's a little bit more than that.  But it was a nightmare.  So I wasn't by a computer.  Kenny finally sends me this link to try to rebook my fees.  Like, it's your responsibility to rebook your flight.  I can't figure it out on my phone.  And then Rob Cross is calling me.  We're missing part of the production for the show, for the live show.  So I had to come back up here after I was done signing the lease.  I had to fix all that.  So by the time I got to a computer, it was like 830 at night. 
[00:26:30]  And everything's like, yeah, you're booked solid.  They booked Troy.  This is United.  This is the great airline they are.  Troy was booked Friday morning to come out.  So they rebooked.  They automatically will rebook you on a flight when it's, quote, unquote, a weather cancellation.  Which it wasn't because Roland's flight made it in.  A lot of flights made it in.  Eric's flight made it in.  Yeah, they're full of shit, United.  They're full of shit.  They just panicked and canceled in advance.  It wasn't like the weather was happening.  They anticipated weather.  And they'll call it a weather canceling. 
[00:27:00]  They booked Troy on a fucking flight Saturday night from Newark going through D.C. into United.  Into Chicago.  But that's going the wrong way.  I hate when planes go the wrong way.  They're terrible.  You're like, I'm negative away from where I want to be at this point.  United's fucking terrible.  They're a terrible airline, man.  A terrible fucking airline.  Let me tell you another thing.  Not a good sense of humor, either.  Oh, boy.  They're not very funny.  What happened?  These people. 
[00:27:30]  What happened?  I tried having a little fun.  You can't have a little fun with airlines.  No shit.  You know?  What did you do?  Well, they were just starting to board, right?  But there's a little back story.  Oh, there's a big back story.  Yeah, we were in the lounge area chatting.  Ant was chatting rather loudly.  He was not well-rested, Ant.  No, I had been up at the casino all night.  And I had been drinking a lot.  And, well, they wanted a board, so I thought it would be kind of funny to do a little hobbly 
[00:28:00]  leg walk down the jetway when they load up the people that, you know, have medical  problems.  Also, it was like 5.30 in the morning, so everybody was cranky as it was.  Oh, yes.  And there had been one loud guy.  So I had my stiff leg, and I'm walking.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's slow this down.  So everyone else is all sleepy, and you're really loud in the lounge?  My night was still going.  All right.  Fair enough.  And there's nothing but they hear somebody tell, like, fucking, like, card stories.  Like, you know, because there's, like, a nice couple next to us. 
[00:28:30]  And it's going, have you ever seen so many fucking 21s in your life?  I was a disaster.  This is 5 in the morning.  They were hoping the plane was going to crash.  Dude, it was fucking, it was so loud.  I was so loud and obnoxious.  But you did the wobbly leg trick.  Yeah.  But you're first class, so you're pretty much, you pretty much could.  I thought it would be funny.  Oh, okay. 
[00:29:00]  It was like a goof.  Everybody kind of chuckles.  And I gave him away.  I didn't know you, like, we were all standing back waiting to get on.  And the guy goes, anybody with disabilities?  And then all of a sudden I see answers peel off.  What are you doing?  But doing, like, hilarious.  Like a high school mocking a cripple limp.  It wasn't even a good limp.  No, it wasn't.  You know what I mean?  You just wanted to get on the plane to go to Sleepy.  I thought he'd be, like, a fucking, you see, here it is, too.  They are a bunch of fucking assholes.  Whoa.  Those United people.  Whoa.  They stink.  But, dude, I started laughing when I saw him doing it. 
[00:29:30]  Like, because he's, he was, I didn't think he was going to go all the way to the agent.  Oh.  He goes to the agent.  I just walked right past him.  And I see him limping through, and the agent, I guess, saw me laughing, but I didn't know  Ant was going to do that, and it was, he was one of these dudes, like, he was one of  these military black guys who's, like, fucking, who's probably an ex-cop or ex-military.  He had that fucking no-nonsense vibe.  Sure.  He was a dick.  He was a dick.  And Ant walked through, and the guy actually turns around and looks at Anthony, and he  watches him walk.  Comes back. 
[00:30:00]  Waits a few seconds.  And then he looked again, and I'm walking.  And then he went and looked again.  And fucking Ant is doing the Oliver Twist dance.  And he's going, okay, get back here.  He's yelling at him.  Really?  He's yelling down the fucking jetway.  Like, ah, relax, come on, I'm just having some fun.  Ah.  But we all know you can't have fun with these airlines.  But that's just it.  Like, I understand if you're going to make a thread or something silly.  Right.  I'm a ticketed passenger.  No, I'm not saying.  I'm just fucking making everybody laugh.  No, no, I'm not.  I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to do that, sir. 
[00:30:30]  I'm just saying that.  Well, that's the point I'm arguing.  They're completely serious, though.  They're so stupid with that.  It's like fucking relax.  They squeeze diamonds out of their asses.  Oh, what a bunch of fucking idiots.  They're a bit tight.  They really are shitty.  Right.  So I understand that you should be able to.  But knowing the culture, my God.  He's an idiot.  They kick you off planes for the dumbest things these days.  Oh, I know.  Exactly.  But I heard the guy yelling down the fucking hallway at Ant, the jetway.  Yeah.  And then I'm right in the front, so I can hear Ant talking to the guy.  And I go, come on. 
[00:31:00]  I'm like, come on.  But then I hear, like, you know, I'm in first class.  I'm like, I'm in first class.  I was going to board anyway.  And the guy's like, no, get back here.  Get back here.  And I hear Ant say something with fuck in it.  I'm like, oh, God, they're going to boot him.  But he's like, come on.  Just fuck it around.  But then he came out.  And it's like, Ant's doing cute, shy Ant.  And he's like, but it was funny.  I'm like, it's funny.  It's funny.  You know, and he gets when he's shy.  Oh, boy.  And the guy was a bit of a dick.  And the guy goes, I spilled alcohol on your breath.  No shit, because I was drinking.  But then he's just like, I could let you not get on. 
[00:31:30]  And he was just a dick.  So then he lets Ant on.  And then I go on right after Ant.  And the guy goes, your friend's very funny.  And I said, I laughed.  I laughed.  I laughed.  I told the guy I laughed.  And then Kenny was right behind me.  And Kenny goes, he won't be a problem.  Good old Kenny trying to mop up everything constantly.  That's good.  But you only had to wait maybe an extra 30 seconds.  It wasn't about the waiting.  You sure?  It was positive.  All right.  I'm just asking.  I got to ask the questions. 
[00:32:00]  It was like, it's the little chuckle.  A little chuckle at 5 in the morning.  A little chuckle.  Everyone's miserable because they got the first flight out.  And we just want to make everyone's day a little better.  That's all.  Actually, fuck everyone.  You know, just our little crew.  Yeah.  It would be kind of funny.  Nice.  Turned out to be even funnier.  Well, see?  Well, then I almost got thrown off the plane.  And that was after the night at the Horseshoe Casino where Jimmy Norton was there with the rest of the guys.  Yes.  How'd that show go?  Good? 
[00:32:30]  Goodly?  It was like a comedy club crowd.  I mean, I couldn't believe from the outside it looks like a little ratty.  But that fucking casino, that crowd was amazing.  Yeah.  Kenny told me it was the best karate scene.  It probably was.  The other anti-social, which you've been doing about two years now, right?  Yeah.  It probably was the best responsive audience.  They had a comedy club feel.  Like, you felt completely in control of the set the entire time, which is hard sometimes.  You know, there's a couple thousand people.  And they were amazing. 
[00:33:00]  I've heard for a while now that our crowds are different than other radio shows.  I'll put it that way.  Well, that's true.  And what I like about them is this.  We do a live broadcast, and it's a rock and roll concert, really.  I mean, people are just yelling and screaming, and we're delivering from some edgy shit, hopefully  some funny shit.  And then, the next day, they sit quietly and listen to a really good comedy show and act  appropriately.  Yeah.  That's huge, if you think about it. 
[00:33:30]  And those crowds are weirder because they're a combination audience.  Those are our ONA and Howard fans, because a lot of them want to see Artie.  And that's usually, that could be a fucking weird mix, but they're like, you know, ONA  fans don't yell at him, and Howard fans don't yell at me.  It's really a weird, great crowd.  Our comic friends appreciate our audience because they say they really get comedy.  Yeah.  They will sit there and listen and appreciate a good comic.  Yeah.  You don't get that with other radio shows.  No.  You really don't.  You get people that just want to be animals the entire fucking time. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, they were very nice.  So that was it?  They didn't kick you off the plane and you slept all the way to New York?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But see, before that, I was at the casino.  And remember Big Fat Guy?  That little Sam wore his shirt?  Yeah.  Big Ben.  Big Ben.  Yeah.  It was Ben, yeah.  He was hanging out at the blackjack table pretty much for the night.  It cost me $100 because I was hoping he would have no shirt on.  Oh, and he parlayed that pretty well.  No shit.  He had a shirt under his shirt, so my $100 was a big fucking waste of time. 
[00:34:30]  We were at a blackjack table for a long-ass time.  He was at the blackjack table with you?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they got a weird thing there, man.  It's just fucking the minimums and maximum bets are crazy at this fucking casino.  It's like you could go to a table that has a $10 minimum, which is a low-ass minimum,  and the maximum bet is $25,000.  At the Borgata, you get a $6,000 maximum bet, and that's if the minimum is like $300.  Wow.  It's weird, so it's like $10, $25,000, whatever you want to fucking bet. 
[00:35:00]  So, yeah, he was sitting there with a bunch of other people.  He had a pretty good full table, and at first, just get my fucking teeth kicked in.  And then, things started changing up, started going very well, and I gotta say, had quite the run.  Had quite the run.  And then, it went south.  I just can't fucking just get up and leave. 
[00:35:30]  I know you don't talk numbers, but did you lose the ball?  No, here's what happened.  I started with about 10, in markers, but 10 Gs.  I was deep.  I was about 10 Gs deep.  Then, I built it up to $60,000.  Jesus.  So, I give Keith 10 grand.  I say, here, pay my markers off.  Buy yourself something nice.  Buy yourself something pretty.  I say, pay off my marker. 
[00:36:00]  And so, he puts it in his pocket for later, when we're ready to pay off the marker.  And, it starts going south, and of course, the retreat is, you know.  And, 60 grand is just the gateway to 100.  That isn't 60 grand.  I look at it as the gateway to 100.  So, it kind of, over a little more time, got whittled away, whittled away.  So, I'm like, fuck, man.  This bitch just nailed me.  So, at that point, Keith did not have the pillow. 
[00:36:30]  So, I did punch the chair next to me, and, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Dude, what the fuck?  When were you going to...  You broke your hand.  No, look.  It was broken.  It's twice the size of your left hand.  It's very swollen.  I bet you you broke, and I'll tell you why.  The hand has a million fucking bones in it.  A small bone or anything?  A million.  Yeah, you could break your hand and barely know that you did it. 
[00:37:00]  No, I feel my knuckle.  I've done this before, um, years ago.  Dude, your hand is twice...  Yeah, it'll go away.  The big reveal, by the way.  I've been sitting here with Dan for an hour.  He doesn't tell me he broke his hand.  No, I was drinking this.  Look how fucking...  It looks fucked up.  It's swollen.  It's black and blue right across my knuckles.  You have a fat man's hand.  It's weird to see a hand with a fat hand.  I got fat man's hand.  It's like a nutty...  Let's compare.  What was it?  A nutty professor hand.  It is a nutty professor hand.  What was it, a cement chair?  I know, right?  It was a wood chair.  Most chairs, you can punch.  How much it's going to give a little? 
[00:37:30]  I hit the knuckle right, and it just went crack and fucking...  Yeah, a little off.  Probably cracked something.  Maybe.  I don't know.  If it's that swollen, you got something going on there.  Probably a little crack.  Maybe one of the little bones broke.  I think the knuckle kind of dug in on the inside of the flesh there or something.  It's a little fucking swollen.  Was it worth it?  How much, Joe, was that hand worth?  Eh, it's all right.  No, how much was that hand worth that made you punch?  Oh, that was like $50,000.  You lost a $50,000 hand?  No, no, no, no.  Not a hand, but it was over time, you know, that whole thing. 
[00:38:00]  So then Keith, me and Keith go to the window.  We're like, all right, pay off the marker.  Then I'm even.  They fucking break even.  So we go up, and Keith gets the $10,000.  He puts it on the counter.  He goes, I gotta go take a piss.  So he's taking a piss, and she's figuring out all the shit with the markers.  I go, hold on, I'll be right back.  I grab the $10,000.  I go to a table.  I pop it down.  I go, deal.  And the woman deals out fucking $18,000 for me, and she's showing a $5,000. 
[00:38:30]  She flips over $15,000, $25,000.  Slides me $10,000.  I go, thank you.  I went back to the window here, pay this off.  And I had $10,000 I walked away with.  Holy shit.  It was a big hand.  All right, so basically you made $10,000.  Yeah.  You had been up $60,000, but does that include the marker or no?  No, it was $50,000.  I was up $50,000.  Oh, you were up $50,000.  Yeah.  So you made $10,000.  $10,000.  So basically there's $40,000 you could have walked away with, not $60,000 more.  Right, right.  $40,000.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  Yeah, but that's gambling.  Yeah.  It's the gambling.  It was fun.  The place was fucking crazy.  That's a wacky casino.  Whoa.  It was fun, though.  It was a good time.  Watch me.  What?  That's a rough one, man.  Oh, it's big.  But you just can't fucking look at it like that's what you lost.  I didn't have it.  It's fucking, you know. 
[00:39:30]  You could walk away with it and be like, oh, I got a lot of money.  If casinos were closer, would you gamble more?  No.  Because you really, it's sporadic with you.  I don't, I like it.  It's fun.  You probably gamble, what, five, six times a year, maybe?  But, yeah.  Maybe.  Because whenever something's going on, I go to a casino.  I never go to a casino just to go.  There's always got to be a show going on or some kind of get-together.  See, that kind of money, though, like, most times the people who can win that kind of money  are the people that can't walk away. 
[00:40:00]  Like, that's, you know what I mean?  Like, you got to be, that's a high-stakes gambler.  Oh, yeah.  And most high-stakes gamblers, I mean, that's the reason guys walk out with 200,000, too,  because they don't walk away at 40 or 50.  Yeah, you got to, you know, you got to play the game.  And we'll hear, I'll hear that and go, what the fuck?  Why did you walk away?  But if you walked in with 250,000, I wouldn't go, why didn't you leave at 30?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  It's like, that's a fucking game that scares me.  Oh, believe me, I would much rather have left with the bigger stack than the 10 grand, but, you know. 
[00:40:30]  That's why gambling is perfect, because we all have it in us.  Even if you're playing and you got $200, you're like, fuck, I want $300.  Right.  I want $400.  That's what they're banking on.  That's how the human brain works.  Exactly.  It's perfect for the casino.  That is absolutely what they're banking on.  Because I would love to go, what is it going to take for you to walk away from a table?  No, but no, the dumb little gambling I do, if I'm up a couple hundred bucks, I don't  go, you know, high stakes, I just fool around a little bit.  You're always thinking, well, I could turn this 250 into five. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, very funny.  They're goofing on me saying, oh, I finally got a big hand.  Dude, that hand is fucking swollen.  Put them both up.  No, the other way.  Isn't there a system you can use?  Oh, fuck, dude.  Can't you use a system?  Does it hurt anywhere?  A system?  Yeah, like a fucking knuckle.  Prow it around a little bit.  Right on the knuckle.  Right there.  Yeah, you probably got a little damage there.  Like, say you have 10,000, you're willing to gamble all of that to get more. 
[00:41:30]  But say you get to 20,000, you give yourself 25% of that you'll play with and then you'll  walk.  Now you're talking crazy.  Yeah, logically it makes sense, but it's impossible.  But if you stick to it winning or losing.  Yeah.  Like, say you, out of 20,000, 25%, that's five grand.  So say if you make $20,000, you get 20,000, you're like, okay, I'll play a quarter of  this.  Whatever happens, I walk.  Where's the glory in that?  No, no, but I mean, it's a way of not losing. 
[00:42:00]  There is a way if you're there to just make the money.  I think there's a very, very, very small percentage of people that actually could follow that.  And what happens if, okay, you bomb out early.  Now what are you going to do?  Go home?  Are you going to fucking hang out and watch other people?  Like, that's the fucked up thing about going to a casino.  You're there.  So you can't just fucking leave after a half hour sometimes.  You're wiped.  You know?  It's just a weird...  And I've been in situations, and I think I'm just a regular gambler, where like, all 
[00:42:30]  right, I'll just gamble what's in my pocket.  Let's say it's $200, $300, $400, maybe.  Maybe as much as $500 at a time.  I'll go, all right, I'll just gamble this.  Yeah.  And if I lose it all, that's it.  I'm done.  I'll go do something else.  No, I'll be at the ATM machine as well.  Yeah, you're just like, ah.  All of a sudden, you get that in your head.  You're like, fuck that.  I'm going to try another $200 or $300 or whatever.  Whatever the ATM could spit out at the time.  And I'm a low-level guy. 
[00:43:00]  But it's in everyone's fucking brain.  You just can't walk away.  It was fun.  I'll tell you that much.  What makes you walk away in the end?  Time to go.  You're just too tired, right?  Time to go.  Keith goes, ah, we got a plane to catch.  But I mean, in general, you gamble until you're just completely exhausted.  Wiped.  You're not like walking away from the table because you're up a huge amount.  Yeah.  Right?  No, I don't leave.  I don't base it on how much I have.  Right.  Yeah, so your luck, you got to hope that you can get to the end. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And get so fucking tired.  And then at that point, just happen to be up a lot.  That's a perfect scenario for you.  There have been times that's happened, you know?  You're like, oh, yeah, it's time to go.  And I didn't have anything going on until like the last hour.  And then I started hitting really big.  Man, the $10,000 hand at the end.  Wow.  That was a big one.  And that never works, that trick.  The trick never fucking works.  Yeah, it was pretty funny.  Whoops.  And then right when I was walking back to the window from the table and I had like the $10,000 in one hand and $10,000 in the other because I'd picked up my bet and the payoff. 
[00:44:00]  And I'm walking back to the window and I hear Keith just walking out of the bathroom.  He looks at me from across the room.  He's like, I fucking knew it because I thought about it the second I left that you were going to pull that shit.  And I was like, hey, I won.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's funny.  It was quite an adventure.  Overall, a great fucking trip, man. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, yeah.  The show was good.  It was fun.  Fucking little hijinks.  Great turnout.  The botchery.  Everything worked out well.  Yeah.  I didn't like the live song.  Like, I thought that was a disaster.  Part of it was.  Oh, people love it.  No, but it was okay.  Part of it was that we should have had lyrics for them to see, which was kind of hard to do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because they don't know the lyrics.  And, you know.  Yeah.  It worked.  I just didn't like doing it.  I was embarrassed.  Oh, Jimmy.  It worked in the end.  I'm shy.  We live and learn.  Yeah.  Because we're just literally making up shit as we go along in front of a live audience. 
[00:45:00]  Not too nerve-wracking.  Yeah.  Because that's how we've always done it over the years.  We have a few ideas and then we hope for the best.  It's kind of a crazy way to do it, but.  Yeah.  Because it worked.  It was fun, but it works.  Management stayed out of our hair during the.  Oh, they couldn't get to the stage in time to stop the puke drinking.  They wanted to stop that really quickly, didn't they?  Boy, did they.  It just happened.  What are you going to do?  It's a live event.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  Put on the invoice.  Yeah.  Hopefully we'll do another city.  We want to keep this going.  We've done Cleveland.  We've done Chicago.  We want to try to do one every three months.  Mm-hmm.  So we can maybe squeeze one more in before the end of the year.  What city will that be?  Ooh.  What city will that be?  What city will it be?  Chicago was a good one.  That's going to be a tough one to beat.  You think?  Yeah.  I'm pushing, and I know Upfield's the city.  Canada.  I want to go to Vancouver. 
[00:46:00]  The city of Canada.  Jimmy's doing Vancouver in what, October?  I'll never do another one of these wrapped around a gig, ever.  But I will do another, ever.  Yeah.  Why?  Because they only pay half my travel when I'm already doing a gig.  So I'll never do another one wrapped around a gig.  This amazes me.  I found this out.  I swear to God, for the people out there, you try to come in here and keep it on the  up and up.  Positive attitude.  Positive.  I mean, I really am trying, because I know it gets annoying as fuck at times.  But then every day, it's some dumb thing where you can't help you God to talk about it. 
[00:46:30]  We learned today that Jimmy, the company only pays for half his travel.  When he has a gig.  The whole reason we went was for Jimmy, and then we wrap a show around it.  Right.  And he works for SiriusXM, so they're getting a lot of value for their buck.  Yes.  We go and do this live broadcast.  It creates a buzz, blah, blah, blah.  And he's on the live broadcast.  And he's on the live broadcast.  But these assholes, they want to save just a few hundred bucks that they only pay for 
[00:47:00]  half of Jimmy's travel, because they go, well, you were going to be out there anyway.  Yeah.  That is just horrible.  Like, when you work for a company, and I know this went away years ago, but I try to  think that maybe these companies still have it.  You know, it's called good faith, where you just do things, because you don't look at a  sheet to see how much money it's going to cost.  You just do the right thing.  Not nickel and diming.  And you just do it in good faith.  You don't go, oh, well, you know, he's going to be there anyway, so let's just, you know,  pay for half the travel. 
[00:47:30]  And to them, they think they're good guys by doing that, by the way.  Yeah.  By, you know, giving you half your travel.  Yeah.  So it turns out, Jimmy went to Chicago and had to pay for half his travel.  Cleveland, too.  Why?  And Cleveland, too.  Yeah, because they think, well, he's already going to be there.  So now my thinking is, I'll just, I'll never do another one where I'm going to be in  that city.  Never you.  Never.  And I don't blame you.  Never.  And again, it's something the dumb fucking company does that just leaves a bad taste in  your mouth.  Why would they do that?  It's disgusting.  Instead of just making a little goodwill with the show. 
[00:48:00]  It's disgusting.  It's not that much to pay to, like, make a show happy.  What's half travel?  So half your plane ticket.  And half the hotel.  Like, again, I'm not unreasonable.  How much is it to fly back and forth to Chicago?  I don't even know, to be totally honest with you.  Eight hundred and fifty two thousand dollars.  I thought it was less than that.  See, I would have taken that flight.  I'm going to guess it's around, you know, between like eight hundred or a thousand dollars.  Each way?  No, no, no round trip.  All right.  So let's say, so you had to pay five hundred dollars to get to Chicago with your flight.  And then the rooms.  They only pay for half your rooms? 
[00:48:30]  Well, we paid.  We stayed.  I guess.  I don't mind paying for my room, by the way.  The night that I'm going to be there, that the show doesn't have to be there.  That I get.  Like, if they were like, look, we'll pay for Thursday, Friday.  Right.  But the thing is, if I'm paying for half my room, I wouldn't have been there Thursday if  it wasn't for the show.  So I'm still.  Right.  And then what drives me nuts.  Then you look around and, you know, these these people are nice and all.  But you see people that have no business being there.  So it's like you stay home and do the right thing and pay for Jimmy's travel. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  I saw guys there.  I'm like, why the fuck are you here?  What do you what do you is there a reason you're even have to be here?  I guess the plane was twelve hundred.  And so it was six hundred bucks.  You had to pay six hundred dollars.  Really?  And the room will probably be about if you want to say money, then tell some of these  idiots to stay home that don't aren't needed.  Whole thing.  A thousand dollars or eleven hundred dollars.  So it cost Jimmy about eleven hundred dollars to go to Chicago and see everybody.  Because it because it is separate. 
[00:49:30]  It is two different things.  Yeah.  You know, then you got your comedy show.  Yes.  You're going to go and do the comedy show.  But then you're doing this live broadcast for the company.  It's just fucking it's disgusting.  So nickel and diming just to spread bad will.  Why would you do that?  Knowing that it's like and that was going to make animosity.  And then, yeah, the other side of happiness, people, the other side of it, Jimmy will think  twice about, you know, hitting the road again with Sirius XM and he'll absolutely think 
[00:50:00]  twice about all this free promotion he gives to company.  You know what?  They let me go.  Like, I'm doing Leno tomorrow night.  I'm going out.  So, you know, when I'm gone, a comic will come in and cover and Bobby and those guys are  all great.  I don't feel guilty about doing that because Jay plugs the, you know, it's like, hey, you  guys want to pay for those plugs?  That's a huge promotion for Sirius XM.  Right.  Me being gone doesn't mean as much as him plugging the show.  You know what I mean?  I understand that.  Yes.  So I don't feel guilty about that.  That, at the very least, is a wash.  At the very least.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Actually, Sirius XM gets more value with you going on lineup.  Sure.  Just because it's a free mention for which.  Dude, that's, I don't even know how much that would cost if they try to get a little  quick commercial, a 10 second commercial on one of these late night shows.  That's got it.  That's tens of thousands of dollars.  Right.  So I don't feel worried about that.  For 10 seconds.  Ugh.  It just is what it is.  Fucking people.  Yeah.  My God.  That's unbelievable.  That's too bad.  It really is.  But, I mean, I'll do another broadcast.  I'll just never, ever wrap it around. 
[00:51:00]  Because I am doing Vancouver, and I am doing Toronto.  And they're both cities that I would love to do broadcasts in.  I would go with Toronto before Vancouver.  I think we have a bigger following there.  Yeah.  Because of Buffalo.  But, you know, I want to do a Canadian gig with the show, the radio show.  Yeah, we should do that.  Is this bad?  This is a really long black hair in my Starbucks coffee.  As opposed to good?  The only one would be worse.  It was under my lid.  Yeah? 
[00:51:30]  It's like six inches.  It's black.  Six inches black.  Just picture, like, fucking some hot chick with long black hair instead of some fucking  Mexican dishwasher.  Not some greasy guy's scalp.  You know what?  I'm usually good with, like, just one hair.  Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'll just keep drinking it.  Oh, a hair?  It's...  Yeah.  I'm going to lose my shit over that.  No.  So...  Ah, Jimmy.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  It's just...  Really?  It's just...  But then, like, they don't mind spending money because there were... 
[00:52:00]  I'll say it again.  There were people there that didn't need to be in Chicago.  So if you're trying to save money...  Yeah, how about that?  You know?  He stays home and then you pay for Jimmy's travel and the broadcast will be exactly the  same.  And everyone's happy.  And then everyone goes away happy.  Yeah.  Instead of having this bad taste in your mouth.  You have a great broadcast and everything, but there's got to be a little fucking thing  there that just...  There's just got to be a way to...  But again, everybody out there deals with this shit. 
[00:52:30]  It's like...  Yeah.  The stuff where you go, like, some things I get, and then there's the other things where  you go, ugh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Ugh.  Woof.  Right.  They waste so much money around here.  And then you've got to show that is doing the right thing and working every day.  Yeah.  And you treat them like shit.  With the little things, you know?  Little weird things.  And everybody goes through this in their daily life.  It's fucking amazing how all companies, all bosses, they just do that. 
[00:53:00]  How did they approach you with that, by the way?  I think Kenny told me, because I think he does the billing, because I believe he told  me, or I asked him.  Well, they might have told me.  I don't remember.  Like, who makes that decision?  I honestly don't remember.  I'd love to know the guy that decided, you know what?  Let's not pay the whole thing.  Plus...  Is it one of these that they just point to the ceiling and go, bah, you know?  And it's not a private Jim Norton gig.  He's representing Sirius XM. 
[00:53:30]  Everyone knows he's a comic, a very good stand-up comic that works at Sirius XM.  You're on that stage.  Holy shit, this is Sirius XM.  He's representing Captain Hook's fish and chip?  What's that?  Plus the fact all the stories you get out of, you know, being on the road.  Yeah.  You bring that back to the radio show.  There's an incredible value.  Yes.  They don't get it.  Us all going to Chicago, broadcasting live, and Jimmy doing his comedy show.  There's value there you can't just write down.  So who do you think you'd have to ask before they say, yeah, it was me. 
[00:54:00]  I made that decision.  Do you think they'd all deflect?  Do you think...  Like, who made that decision?  I honestly don't know.  Who's the lowest guy in management?  Is it the intern guy?  The lowest...  Yeah, Rob Cross would be the lowest guy.  He's the one that's been interning for the company.  I don't think it's Rob.  I don't think Rob would do it.  Then who's next after Rob?  Who's next?  Gary.  Gary.  So it's probably not him. 
[00:54:30]  It's not the weasel.  It's a long way to get a weasel joke in.  You don't think it's him?  I honestly don't know, dude.  I don't know.  No one will take responsibility.  They'll go, oh, it's corporate policy.  Corporate policy.  There's no policy for that.  Corporate policy.  There's no policy for a comic that has a gig in a city.  You're doing an appearance.  Who the fuck has that policy? 
[00:55:00]  You think they're in the back offices just like this with their hands?  Like, oh, we're going to save 800 bucks.  He's going up there for a gig.  Because it's like all they've made me do is go...  Of course I'll go out and do the...  I love doing these live shows.  I will just never wrap one around a gig again.  I don't blame you.  Ever.  I don't blame you.  But I understand how they look at it.  They look at it like, well, you should look at it like you're saving half your own travel.  Oh, boy.  But it's like it annoys me so much that I would rather just go separately and pay my own travel. 
[00:55:30]  Like, I literally would rather do that.  Yeah.  And I don't blame you and you should do it that way.  But, you know, Sirius XM, they're blowing it because it's a perfect combination to go to the city that Jimmy's doing a comedy show.  Yeah, it works.  It just kind of works.  Yeah, do the show and then the same people, like, end up going to the comedy show and it's just cool.  Our room probably, I don't know, we might have had less people there if Jimmy wasn't having a comedy show in Chicago. 
[00:56:00]  Because people are coming for the comedy show from faraway lawns.  Exactly.  And then they go, hey, and Owen Ayer broadcasting and Jim Dorn broadcasting live, then fuck.  Yeah.  We get to see that as well.  Yeah.  It's just silly.  It's mind-boggling.  And I know that word's used a lot on the show or that phrase, whatever, but it's mind-boggling.  Just do the right thing.  We just stop already.  And stop with this flying these guys out last minute.  That was almost a disaster.  E-Rock, like, had delays and he had to go right to the gig with his luggage. 
[00:56:30]  It's just not the way to do things.  Who's screening phone calls?  Why?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, you can't just put that on the air.  You can't fucking put that on the air.  What was it?  What was it?  It's a political comment he wants to make that could fucking, you know, get certain people from certain government agencies down here.  Who is it?  Who's the dope?  Jesus.  Who is it?  Who is it?  That's Handsome Rob.  Handsome Rob?  What the fuck's Handsome Rob?  Can we just call him Rob? 
[00:57:00]  Rob.  Well, who's Handsome Rob?  He is Handsome.  Well, he's the end term we all want to fuck.  Which one is he?  Just say the fuckable intern.  The one is him in the pool party.  Oh, my God.  So it's Pool Party Rob.  You're going to miss the fucking pool party and keep that shit up.  But, yeah, he doesn't know the rules.  But someone who's in charge of the intern should tell them the rules.  Oh, E-Rock.  That just say, assassination commentary of any kind is probably not good on the radio show.  Probably not a good idea.  Yeah, E-Rock, you know that, right?  Jesus.  Yeah.  You might have to tell Pool Party, Handsome fucking Rob. 
[00:57:30]  At least he put what it was, though.  I'll say that.  That was a good one to put accurately.  Well, he did, yes.  We're all for political chatter.  But when it comes to assassination comments, probably better not, you know.  Not a good idea.  I'm not going to get fired because you fucking, you're sweating under your armpits and you have dry breath and you want to say something horrible about a politician.  Right.  Oh, we should eat.  You want to eat?  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, and then it gets cold.  Yeah, I hate cold eggs.  I know.  Yeah, all right.  What's worse than runny eggs?  I don't have tuna today because it's Monday, so I got to go with this and it's got to be hot or it's really bad.  All right, we'll break.  Talk about Chicago a little more.  We got some clips from the Chicago show.  Do we have any clips we could play right now?  Yeah, they're all long form if you're cool with that.  Oh.  Should we come back and then explain it?  Three, four minutes.  Is someone cutting up some shit?  Some highlights?  Yeah, we've got a couple already cut up.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  What do you want to play? 
[00:58:30]  We have the final guy making me puke who was vomiting, Sam vomiting.  We also have a clip of the guy drinking from the cup, the chip finalist.  What's that?  Oh, that was fine.  So that guy, the next night in normal mode, too.  Well, just play one.  Does it need a setup?  Just me throwing up because somebody else threw up.  From our live gig in Chicago.  We'll be back.  Bro, this is a bust.  Yeah, this guy.  Dude, all it has to be is one person that stinks. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, this guy is actually putting his finger down his throat.  Oh, yeah.  This guy's a problem.  A very big dude.  Well, he's liking a compound show, so he obviously likes a show that stinks.  Oh, he just puked.  He just stuck his fingers down his throat.  He puked in a cup.  Iraq's coming over now.  He's going to breathe in Iraq's face.  Oh, Iraq's going up.  Iraq's puking.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The catastrophe.  Oh, the humanity.  Don't puking in Iraq.  Oh, he's throwing up bile in a cup. 
[00:59:30]  Ah.  Ah, Iraq.  Iraq's growing up now.  Ah.  All right, wait a minute.  What happened?  Wait.  What happened?  Oh, the guy's puking.  He made Iraq puke.  He's licking bile off his fingers.  This is terrible.  Iraq's not going to be...  He's not being a good judge.  You're not being a good judge.  Shut the fuck up.  He puked in my face.  He puked in his face. 
[01:00:00]  You're not being a good judge.  All right, here we go.  Make it official.  Make it official.  So far, he's in the lead.  Yes.  So far, he's in the lead, Iraq's face.  He put his fingers down his throat.  He puked up this viscous brown fucking fluid.  One more time.  Oh, into a cup.  One more time.  One more time.  Wait, hold on.  One more time.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's go right up front.  Right up front.  Wait, let him puke into a cup.  And then maybe if we want to get somebody else to smell that at the end, we can do that.  Oh, there's a good idea. 
[01:00:30]  You're welcome.  Oh, he's puking.  Iraq, everyone's looking for...  He's putting his fingers down his throat.  Everyone's looking for their phone.  Oh, he's probably sure to play himself.  One more time.  Very vile-y puke he's got there.  He's a very tall, big guy.  One more time, Iraq.  Oh, that reminds me.  Could someone get me a mudslide?  Bestgaming.com fuck B-Man.  Oh, all right.  Hey, wait, wait, wait.  One more time, Iraq.  Now breathe into Iraq's face.  Breathe into Iraq's face.  No, let Iraq smell the cup.  Let Iraq smell the cup.  Oh. 
[01:01:00]  Iraq's dry heaving.  He's dry heaving.  Oh, God damn.  Iraq, look at the cup and...  Oh, Iraq's dry.  Oh, Iraq.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Oh, Iraq.  Iraq, Iraq, Iraq.  Oh.  Iraq, Iraq.  Iraq.  If only you could make that a habit,  maybe you'd be human weight. 
[01:01:30]  Move that cup down.  What do you guys think of that, huh?  Wow.  Sam.  Hey, Sam.  Hey, Sam.  Smell that cup.  How bad does that smell?  Just tell me if it's bad or not.  Smell it.  Just smell it.  All right, Sam.  Give it a sniff.  Give it a sniff.  Oh, ha.  Sam's dry heaving.  Oh, he's dry heaving.  Oh, come on.  How bad could it be?  You don't like bile-y foot?  No, no. 
[01:02:00]  I swear to God, I'll shoot you.  Put it on toast like apple butter.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Opie and Anthony's assault on the Midwest is complete.  You're not filling up.  You're not sticking.  Just don't call me late for sucking my cock.  As long as you return the favor.  Let's suck your cock. 
[01:02:30]  I'll handle this, Sam.  Ass, ass, titties, titties, ass, titties.  Don't forget the belly.  Get it straight, Opie.  That's a beer bottle.  Chicago's own CF box.  Are you guys having a good time today with us in Chicago?  Thanks for the memories, Chicago.  Go to facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony for pics and video.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here. 
[01:03:00]  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul remembers playing Lost in Space.  I used to call you Will Robinson.  I'd go, danger, danger.  We'd hide under the covers together.  Cause he had like really pale buttocks that pinch him so hard that my fingerprints would be in him.  Like little hunks of dough. 
[01:03:30]  Let me get in there and make the fudge soft.  We put some oil where the fudge comes out.  Make it come out smoother.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Coming up on the next episode of The Spectacular Suicide. 
[01:04:00]  Police Commissioner Vic Dumb grills our young hero about his mishandling of the Angerman incident.  Meanwhile, a deadly new temptress lurks in the shadows.  Goddamn suicide.  How many times have I told you?  I know, but the children.  That's enough.  You screwed up the entire operation and Angerman managed to escape.  Whoa.  He escaped? 
[01:04:30]  I almost had that happen.  I'm unstoppable.  Never mind that.  It's our case now.  Stay the hell out of the way.  But, but, but.  That's enough.  Stay here.  I'm not finished with you.  I have to go take a shit.  The city needs me.  I'll, I'll show them I can stop crime.  Hey there, suicide.  Oh no, Jenny, tell ya.  How the hell did you get in here?  My beauty was too much for this police department to handle. 
[01:05:00]  Now, they're all stuck in my sexy trance.  No, you didn't.  Oh, yes I did.  And now I have you all to myself now, suicide.  Stop it.  Why, suicide?  Aren't you getting turned on?  No.  I can't let this happen.  Stop it.  Get away from me.  That's right, suicide.  Stare through my horn-rimmed glasses and into my eyes. 
[01:05:30]  Oh God, it's getting too tight.  That's right.  No, no.  Yes.  Come on, suicide.  Oh my God, I'm coming.  Oh my sweet suicide.  Now, with you out of the way, this city will finally be under my control.  What the, what the hell happened here?  Suicide, wake up, wake up. 
[01:06:00]  It, it, no, this can't be happening.  It was Jenny Tillia.  Well, she's gonna pay for this.  Stay tuned for an all new adventure of the spectacular suicide.  Sirius XM, this is the OPNS Today Show.  So I guess the Olympics are over, huh? 
[01:06:30]  That was a complete waste of time.  Did they really cut into the closing ceremony?  Yeah, they did.  Yeah, they did.  How awful.  NBC, you know, they gotta get their promotion in.  I love when they do the, uh, the local promo for your local news.  Like, oh, because I'm watching the Olympics, I guess I'm gonna start watching.  I'm gonna watch the local news.  I'm gonna watch NBC's local news now.  I'm gonna watch that news from, like, what I learned yesterday online.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Great stuff.  But they believe in that.  Like, alright, we get one promo an hour for our local news.  You know, that's just something the internet can't give us, that local angle.  That's what we need to embrace.  And shut up.  Shut up.  No one cares.  Yeah, this is what happened.  I was, uh, watching the closing ceremonies, and, uh, this is what NBC did.  You gotta hear this in case you weren't up.  They have this new show on called Animal Practice.  Oh, boy.  What's his name on it?  Who that? 
[01:07:30]  Uh, Bobby Lee.  Not sure.  Alright.  Yes, he is.  Is he?  Yeah, Bobby Lee's got a little spot on it.  He plays one of the other vets.  Good for him.  Oh, what is this?  It's like ER for animals or something?  Oh, God.  Okay, well, good for Bobby Lee.  No, good for Bobby Lee, though.  I'm sure, well, he'll be terrific no matter what.  That's a guarantee.  This is what NBC did around 11 o'clock last night.  We'll be back to the Olympic Stadium in about an hour for the London Closing Party featuring The Who. 
[01:08:00]  But stay tuned now for a full episode of Animal Practice, a new NBC comedy presented commercial-free.  See, they're like, wow, we got this big audience,  and so why don't we make them wait for The Who?  They actually said, it's not in this clip,  Bob Costas goes, well, that concludes the closing ceremonies,  but we'll be back in an hour for the after party or whatever the fuck you just said.  That's bullshit.  No, it doesn't conclude the closing ceremonies.  They're still there enjoying it. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Was there actually stuff that they, because it's a six-hour delay,  was there stuff that they didn't show, or did they show everything but just split it?  They pretty much showed everything.  But they split it.  And then they decided that it was officially over,  and then they were going to call the Who part, you know, the after party.  After party.  How much promotion do you need to do?  So then they made people wait for an hour for The Who.  Do you think people watched the show? 
[01:09:00]  Do you think they stayed and watched?  For Animal Practice, it probably worked.  You probably get a bunch of people that are going to watch that probably wouldn't have.  Maybe.  But enough.  And then there's your local news.  Your local news is next.  Get your local news in there.  And then they went back, and I guess The Who performed.  I couldn't stay up for that shit.  What did The Who perform?  They sound good.  They did a medley.  Did they do, ho, ho, ho, ho.  And they did a medley?  They did.  They started with.  That's the new thing.  A vegetable medley.  Hate medleys. 
[01:09:30]  That's the new thing, because no one has a large attention span these days.  No, they all need clips and medleys.  You're right, yeah.  It used to be you would enjoy one song from these bands, but not anymore, man.  Oh, no.  People are really annoyed that you had to pay for your travel. 
[01:10:00]  Are they really?  Yeah, I just took a peek as this intro was going on forever.  And this guy, Dave Curtis in Houston, makes a good point.  He says, plus with Jimmy and Artie at their show, it was a serious fan-based fucking comedy show.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Because now you've got people in the audience like, well, you know, I don't have Sirius XM. 
[01:10:30]  But holy fuck, you know, Jimmy was really funny.  Artie was really funny.  Nick was really funny.  David Tell, who doesn't have a show technically on Sirius XM, but shows up on all the shows.  That's going to turn people on to subscriptions.  It's just terrible.  It is.  You know, and again, it is what it is.  I'll be happy to do other live events.  Never, ever will I rap.  But I would rather just pay my own fucking travel, go with Kenny, and do my gig. 
[01:11:00]  That's what I hope.  I just want to hear if Roger Dalton can still sing.  Can he hit those notes, you think?  He's probably been pretty good, but he's pretty old now.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, damn it.  That's okay, right? 
[01:11:30]  That's pretty good.  That's really good.  That sounds live, too.  None of that lip syncing shit.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's good.  That guy's fucking 70.  What is he?  Jesus.  He's crazy.  Up for 60.  He's easily, right?  Give it a belt that out like that. 
[01:12:00]  Goddamn good.  Then what do they go into?  It's a medley.  I hate medley.  Play this fucking song.  Short attention span.  Dumb planet.  He's still doing this song.  Is this Townsend doing this?  Mine.  There's more than Jesus.  Oh, I see.  Because he had to change it.  Because they're old now.  I hate him.  How about you just fucking sing it like it was meant to be sung? 
[01:12:30]  Don't worry.  We know you're old.  Yeah, you don't have to change it around.  It's okay.  What was the song you were supposed to sing?  It's only Teenage Wasteland.  All right.  Where's the medley?  Well, now I want to hear the medley.  I'm sorry.  What do you want to do?  Now I want to hear what the medley is.  Medley.  We got to hear what you're going to do.  You sure?  Let's hear medley.  They were very proud of their artists last night. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  Does it switch now?  Are they switching into another song?  All right.  So far, no. 
[01:13:30]  Nah, this is still...  See me.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Whoa.  Way to put the brakes on.  Nice.  All right.  Sorry.  Now I'm going to go back.  There you go.  See me.  Ah, yeah.  That was a little rough transition. 
[01:14:00]  How many times are they going to do this before he goes into that?  What song is this?  See me, feel me, touch me.  Listen to you.  Look at the music.  Touch me.  One more time.  This is from Tommy at the Rock.  The Rock Opera.  Why wouldn't it be? 
[01:14:30]  Wow.  Tommy is a brilliant album.  I got to stick up for the Who.  That album is ridiculous.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  I've been doing it all day long.  What do you want to do here?  Medley.  There's another song.  You want to keep going? 
[01:15:00]  All right.  Another song.  Let's see how they transition.  It's pretty fucking amazing.  They've been around for 8,000 years.  Let's go pull it off.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Little Pete Townsend playing some guitar there. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  Was he doing the windmill?  Oh, yeah.  Was he windmilling?  Yes, he was.  Looking like an old zicker.  Was he really?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, no.  They did this at Woodstock.  It was pretty big.  The original Woodstock?  Yes, the original 1969 Woodstock.  That's 43 years ago. 
[01:16:00]  Ah, there is real.  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.  I don't remember that.  I remember the moon landing a couple of months earlier, or a month earlier.  Oh, child of the what?  80s, huh?  Oh, here we go.  Come on.  Come on.  Where are you?  What are we going into?  Behind blue eyes?  I hope so. 
[01:16:30]  Behind blue eyes.  What's going on?  It's pandemonium.  I'm talking about my generation.  I'm talking about my generation.  Does he change it when he's got to say, hope I die before I get old?  Oh, this is sloppy.  Oh, this is sloppy. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's fireworks going on here.  Yeah, it kind of interferes with the music a little.  Fireworks over your song.  It sounds good, though.  It sounds great.  Oh, oh, well.  Oh, see?  Yeah.  He passed away. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Well.  Yeah.  All right.  Come on.  What's the next song?  I think they've got to get behind blue eyes in there, right?  Well, this might be it.  Yeah.  Let's go. 
[01:18:00]  What about rough toys?  All right.  I've got to go back to 1989 when I was living in Buffalo.  Oh, child.  And I went and saw the Who's final tour.  Oh, the farewell tour of 89.  The farewell tour of 89.  Yeah.  It's now 2012.  2012.  And they made that a big deal.  This is it.  The Who is going away.  They still sound all right, man. 
[01:18:30]  Well, there's only two of them.  That hope I die before I get old shit?  Yeah.  As soon as you turn 22, guess what?  You don't hope for that shit anymore.  You know?  Yeah.  You're growing up.  You're like, yeah, man.  I don't want to be old ever, man.  I never trust anyone over 30.  And then you turn 22 is about the age.  Kind of graduating college.  Or maybe, you know, you're a few years out of high school.  Maybe you didn't go to college.  But then right around then, you're like, you know what?  No, I don't hope to die before I get old anymore. 
[01:19:00]  I hope very much that I get old.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Very old.  You start feeling creepy driving through the parking lot of your school.  Right.  A couple of years later, like, I shouldn't be doing this anymore.  I still say that to myself.  I also remember a Rolling Stones concert that I was not at.  Steel Wheels?  Where they made a huge deal that Mick Jagger was turning 40.  I remember this like it was yesterday.  And they went, man, you know, I don't know.  You think the Stones, now that they're getting older. 
[01:19:30]  Still rocking at 40.  Yeah.  But they were questioning it, like, you know, how many more years can he do?  He's 40.  And now what?  The Stones are pretty much going to go on tour to celebrate 50 years?  Is it the Stones, though?  It's more like it's Mick.  I think Charlie Watts retired, right?  The drummer's always a...  Oh, Watts has been...  Yeah, I think he's done...  Obviously, Bill Wyman's been gone for years.  Bill Wyman has been gone for a long time.  When did he leave?  Still the Stones, though, if it's Jagger and Richards.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  You know, they've had some people that have certainly helped them out over the years.  And Ron Wood, too, is still there, I think.  Yeah, and Ron Wood will certainly tour with them.  But, you know, that whole Mick Jagger turning 40, is this it for the Stones?  Yeah, yeah.  That was like almost 30 years ago they were talking that shit.  Quite amazing.  Quite amazing.  What else from the closing ceremonies?  They had a lot of weird fucking bands come out.  I don't know why.  Just because, I guess, it was London, it was England, it was Britain.  They had to put Britain's best out there. 
[01:20:30]  That's what they did.  And who knew that some of those bands were still...  Ho, ho!  Ho, ho!  Yeah, but they went weird, man.  That's what I mean.  Like, some of those bands are still popular there, or what?  They went with Madness.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In our house.  Why'd they do that?  Is that big over there, you think?  I don't know.  Maybe they're still popular there.  They're kind of showing what Britain has to offer.  Oh, that was weird.  I don't know.  They had to go way back.  They had Madness, our house.  Yeah.  I mean, I think about a billion people around the world were watching these closing ceremonies, 
[01:21:00]  I would guess.  Yeah.  And they put Madness on the stage.  Remember this song?  Yeah.  Who didn't like this?  It's a happy little song.  It's a good song, but think, closing ceremonies for the Olympics, you put Madness out there?  And you go Madness into One Direction?  Yeah.  It was really all over the place.  Weird, yeah.  And the guy looked really fucking old.  Did he?  They weren't trying to sing.  I don't know.  I think they might have been lip syncing. 
[01:21:30]  I had no idea what lip syncing was going on.  Huh?  What?  I heard a lot of lip syncing was going on.  Well, this is the original, so this isn't them last night.  Yeah, I would like to hear them from last night.  Can we find that somewhere?  We used to make fun of my friend's family, and he lived on Newton Street, and me and  my buddy Frank would go, our house, in the middle of Newton Street, and then we'd  just make up some of our family.  That's funny, Chip.  Oh, wait.  I was young, though.  I was young, Jimmy.  I wasn't chipping yet.  Yeah.  I was still, I was 12.  You were just young, Jimmy. 
[01:22:00]  The Rolling Stones fans are killing us.  Charlie Watts is definitely still in the Stones.  Oh, good.  Okay, sorry.  I heard he was retiring.  I'm glad.  Yeah, I thought he was just about done, too.  I call him Chucky W.  People hate that.  And the Pet Shop Boys?  Yeah.  The Pet Shop Boys.  The Pet Shop Boys.  For the closing ceremonies of the Olympics.  You know that song, Weston Girls?  Easton Boys and Weston Girls.  They're just weirdos.  Yeah.  You didn't see any of these performances last night?  Nine.  The Pet Shop Boys are just weirdos. 
[01:22:30]  Are they really?  This is a great song, though.  It's a guilty pleasure.  But they felt like this needed to be performed live at the closing ceremonies.  Why?  Why bring this back?  I was very confused by this thing.  Very strange.  I don't know why.  You had to go with, you know, way back to show the world what Britain has to offer with  the Pet Shop Boys.  Was Michaela Maroney impressed by anything?  You know?  She made a face? 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  Gymnast.  Oh.  You love her, huh?  Nah.  She was made for you.  She's alright, but...  Wow, she's...  I don't know.  She's got that fucking gymnast body thing going on.  You know, it's weird.  They're all really, really, really weirdos.  They're all really short.  Damn.  Why this at the closing ceremonies?  It's odd.  Can we get video of this shit online yet?  It's NBC's being, uh...  Dicks?  Dickheads.  The fucking Olympics are over.  What are they doing now?  They're probably putting together a DVD or something. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, please, right?  But within two days, no one's going to give a fuck anymore.  We're talking about it today.  By tomorrow, we don't give a fuck about the closing ceremonies.  This reminds me of my childhood, though.  I gotta be honest.  This one?  Yeah.  You know.  The 80s.  Yeah.  This was 1985.  Right in the middle of it.  Yeah.  Right in the middle of my childhood.  Right?  Sam?  What if?  Difficult.  Do you at least have a still of what they look like?  I can't... 
[01:24:00]  Because they're just weirdos.  Yeah.  This is how they performed the song, and look.  They're on these tri...  Tri-pads.  It's like a big tricycle, like those pedicabs.  Like a pedicab, thank you.  And they have those weird helmets on.  And then they got really pointy orange hats on, where the top goes pointy, and then the  chin area goes pointy.  They probably look really old, don't you to see it, so they're just putting masks on.  They look like idiots.  They're putting on these elaborate outfits as if tomorrow, the Pet Shop Boys are going 
[01:24:30]  to be what everybody's talking about.  That's it.  This is going to be their big launching.  Album sails through the roof.  And then everyone had to take a lap around the track as they performed.  As they...  As they performed?  Yeah.  They were just riding bicycles and singing this song.  So, first of all, they're wearing something on their head, so you can't even see them lip-syncing.  So they don't even have to lip-sync.  Well, no, no, no.  They pretty much...  It doesn't even have to be them.  No, no, they're the two behind in the black pointy hats. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, I got you.  The fucking weirdos.  What the fuck are they doing?  Really long, skinny, pointy hats.  They're all in black.  Yeah, that's...  Where was Flock of Seagulls?  Yeah.  Did they play?  They did not.  No?  No.  Great question.  Let's see this.  Texi's Midnight Runners, did they play?  They brought out the Spice Girls.  What about the safety dance guy?  No.  Safety dance guy was not performing.  What about Falco?  No.  Did Falco come out?  No.  I think he's dead.  They brought out the Spice Girls.  Spice Girls came out, right?  Did you spice up your life? 
[01:25:30]  And who made the point?  Was it you, Sam, about Posh?  I said Ginger would still get it.  Well, maybe it wasn't you.  Posh did not want to be there.  She's above all this shit.  Oh, yeah, Travis, we were talking about that earlier, yeah.  She's like royalty over there.  Royalty.  They must have paid her a shitload of money just to do the Spice Girl reunion.  Is this from last night?  No, you have last night.  Did they sing?  Oh, yeah, they did.  Did they lip sync?  Yeah, they had to.  I don't know.  It didn't sound like lip syncing.  All right.  Oh, really?  It didn't sound like lip syncing. 
[01:26:00]  Let me tell you what they do sometimes these days.  They take these people into a studio, and you do a live version of your song, and make  sure it comes out perfectly, and then you lip sync to that, so it sounds like you're  doing a live song.  It wasn't perfect.  Yeah?  Which made me think it wasn't lip syncing.  Like, One Direction was lip syncing.  What's the problem if you're a performer to fucking do it live, and if you fuck up a little  bit, or if it's a little long, who cares?  Spice Girls aren't performers anymore.  Why does everything have to be completely safe? 
[01:26:30]  I don't think, yeah.  I don't think anybody cared.  This is from last night.  That sounds live, yeah.  Well, it might be what Ann's saying.  That's obviously a studio track.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shouldn't they be singing that song?  I'm not buying it. 
[01:27:00]  This song stinks anyway.  No, it doesn't.  It's awful.  No, it doesn't matter.  Oh, that's real.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They just yell stupid posh and chippy spice.  And that was it.  Is it a medley?  Yeah, there was their medley, too.  We don't have to go through their medley. 
[01:27:30]  I think they did just one more song, or is it two?  Yeah, they did Spice Up Your Life after that.  And then they did a John Lennon song.  They did Imagine.  We're all still imagining, aren't we now?  Yeah.  We're still imagining.  Do you know, by the way, how they might get these people to do this?  Because they all have an interest in the greatest hits albums.  They probably all get a piece of that.  So they probably say that typically when you're performing in front of almost a billion people,  you might sell a million records.  You know, it's just extra money.  Oh, my God.  Whoa. 
[01:28:00]  Excuse me, guys.  That was a good one.  Pardon me.  But you could tell posh has moved on from the Spice Girls, but...  Is she the one banging Beckham?  Yeah, they're married and all that shit.  And she's like royalty, like I said, and she doesn't want to do this shit.  So they must have paid her so much fucking money to come back.  Dikey Spice.  Oh!  Looking good?  Oh!  You don't look too bad.  Which one's that?  What about Dikey Spice?  Where's Dikey Spice?  Yeah, I think...  That's scary.  Scary Spice.  Scary Spice.  What about Sporty Spice?  Yeah, where's...  Sporty...  Where's Spooey Spice? 
[01:28:30]  Where's Clitty Spice?  They looked all right.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  They looked fine.  That's it.  The Spice Women.  I like Dikey Spice.  It was scary, sporty, posh.  Posh.  Ginger.  And Ginger.  You like them?  Well, Ginger was the goer.  You know Ginger was...  She was down for whatever.  Down for whatever.  She was also the first girl to leave the group.  Oh, boy.  Why'd she leave?  What year were they?  Like, 90s?  99-ish?  98?  Why'd she leave, you think?  Late 90s for them? 
[01:29:00]  Really?  Was it 97-ish, maybe?  Yeah, I think you gotta go back to then.  Sure.  Had her solo career due, Sammy.  She had one single that was a very moderate hit, and that was it.  What was the song?  No one knows.  Yeah.  I like that one.  No one knows what...  No one knows what it's like.  Listen to the words.  Man.  It's called Look at Me.  Look at me?  Oh, I don't know that one.  And then, Russell Brand. 
[01:29:30]  We gotta discuss him for one minute.  All I know is, when Russell Brand showed up at the closing ceremonies, Twitter exploded  with hatred.  No one likes him.  Well, I don't know, but he gets these big spots still.  I'll tell you why.  But Twitter fucking hates him.  Yeah.  Do you know why?  Because, here's why.  That's the question I want to ask.  He's not an untalented guy.  He's not, like, he's an ex-heroin addict, but he has an interesting story.  What does he do?  I'll tell you why people don't like him. 
[01:30:00]  There's nothing appealing about a sexy fucking comedian.  People don't like when a comic is sexying it up with open shirts.  There's something so, like, comics, as they say, we're, you know, we're pie-in-the-face  people.  It's, you know, nobody wants to see a fucking clown come out with his fucking shirt open  and a gold medallion.  That's true.  I mean, you could look good and be funny.  Like, there's a lot of good-looking, like, Chris Rock wears a three-piece suit, and he 
[01:30:30]  looks, he's not a bad-looking dude, but nobody likes an over-the-top, sexy comic.  That, to me, is where a lot of the resentment comes from.  So then, why are the people in the know, why are they still giving him these big spots?  It seems like people have really turned on this guy.  Well, they're dummies.  They just know that he hosted the awards twice, and I don't know why people, like, he was  a fairly edgy award host.  I liked him at first.  Yeah.  I really did.  He came out of nowhere.  We had him on our show. 
[01:31:00]  We absolutely had a good time.  Some people are saying, you know, that we beat him up because he doesn't do our show  anymore.  No, I don't beat him up.  No, I don't care.  I just don't find him entertaining.  He may still be big in England.  And what is he?  Is he Willy Wonka now?  No, he was just doing the, you know.  He was just looking like Willy Wonka?  And he did the song.  What, he said he didn't do any stand-up?  No, he was singing.  Why not?  Why not do stand-up?  He actually pulled off I Am the Walrus, though.  I told Anthony, you got to give him credit for that. 
[01:31:30]  He pulled it off.  Yeah, but he didn't pull off the Willy Wonka song.  Here I am the walrus.  It's his medley.  Oh, boy.  Everyone's got a fucking medley.  Everyone had a medley.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, shut up.  Boys and girls.  Listen for the booze.  Goze.  Prepare to enter the realm of your imagination.  Make a wish.  Come with me.  And you'll be.  In a world of your imagination. 
[01:32:00]  Is that booze or the music?  I don't know.  It sounded like booze.  And you'll see.  Into your imagination.  We'll begin.  Is this him?  Yeah.  This is the Olympics closing ceremony.  Holy fuck.  That's god-awful.  Oh, cow.  Makes you mad?  It's just, it's laughable.  It's so fucking awful.  I get what they're going for, is this pop culture. 
[01:32:30]  Well, you know.  You know, booyah bass.  Booyah bass.  I despise booyah bass.  They were putting on a rock show, you know.  With a bunch of things.  But he's not a rock star.  And that's the thing that people don't like about him.  Yes.  You're a stand-up.  And you have an interesting story.  And he's funny.  But the bottom line is, this type of shit.  Coming out, trying to be cute and sexy and a rock star and hot.  You know, hey.  Like that shit, people are like, shut up. 
[01:33:00]  The world of my creation, what you'll see, will defy, explanation.  Ugh.  I don't know what that is.  Really walking in the chocolate factory.  Oh, yeah.  Let's talk about Ryan for a second.  Shut the fuck up.  Why was he talking?  He was talking a lot.  Is that commentary about the whole thing?  Yeah.  It's like, look, you don't have to say anything.  We get it.  We understand what that was. 
[01:33:30]  We know it's Russell Brand.  And we know Beatles songs.  Shut up.  Wait a minute.  He jumped in during the song?  He jumped in the entire time.  I'll tell you why.  So when the DVD comes out, you have the raw performances without his fucking dumb commentary.  This way you can't tape him, tape it from here, and get a good copy of it.  You have to fucking buy it on a DVD if you want the whole thing.  Oh, maybe.  Because it was really annoying after a while.  Yeah.  He would just pipe in with just nonsense for, I don't know, five, ten seconds.  And then, it was really strange.  It came out of nowhere. 
[01:34:00]  He blew up Eric Idle's spot.  What did he say?  Like, Eric Idle did the thing where he fell out of the cannon, but you couldn't tell it  was Eric Idle.  Right.  And he was like, and that man who fell out of the cannon was Eric Idle.  And then Eric Idle stands up, and that's the laugh that it was him.  That's the laugh.  What an idiot.  That's what I'm saying.  He did not help things.  No.  I'm glad he was there, though, because I feel like we haven't had enough of him recently.  No, no.  But he doesn't inspire the hatred that Russell Brand does, even though I think he's much 
[01:34:30]  more hateable.  But it's more like he's just doing what he does.  He's just good-looking, questionable sexuality announcer guy.  But that's what he's being.  He's just being the announcer guy who's kind of annoying and overwraps everything.  It was just not needed, is my point.  We're still with Russell Brand.  Look at this.  From Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, there is Russell Brand opening this portion.  A lot of psychedelic color here.  As part of the show celebrates British individuality and free-spiritedness. 
[01:35:00]  Russell Brand, perfect for that.  What'd you say?  He's talking it up.  He talked it up like it was on the air.  He was trying to get to the fucking post.  Shut up.  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  Hey, he is.  That's Russell Brand.  He's pulling it off.  The effect helps a lot. 
[01:35:30]  Huh?  That effect helps a lot.  That's that fucking...  Oh, the original has that, too.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  E-Rock's favorite song.  I think people dislike him because as a comedian, if you said to me, will you sing a Beatles song 
[01:36:00]  at the closing ceremony of the Olympics, I would say no.  Right.  I'll do something, but I will not sing a Beatles song.  I really like this song, too.  I do, too.  I thought he pulled it off.  Yeah.  As much as I don't like the guy, I've got to give him credit for Paul Williams.  I just don't like him. 
[01:36:30]  I just don't like him.  You never like anyone who wants to show you how sexy they are.  Look at my chest. 
[01:37:00]  Can you pull this one off, man?  Yeah.  I'm stuck.  Woo!  All right.  That's it pretty much for it.  Yeah, Russell Brand getting a lot of hate on the Twitter.  Then he intro'd Fat Boy Slim. 
[01:37:30]  Wasn't really looking like a boy anymore.  No, he wasn't, was he?  No, he's wearing my dad's shirt.  Fat Boy Slim always looked old, but now you fast forward, what, 10 years probably at this  point?  Can't really dance.  I like a bunch of Fat Boy Slim songs.  We had him in.  Yeah, he was cool.  Well, he's good at what he does, it's just he can't aesthetically be that DJ guy anymore.  No.  Is he good, though?  Yeah.  I mean, his songs are great.  Which one of his songs?  Give me, I don't know, give me something. 
[01:38:00]  Do it in the Fat Boy Slim.  There you go.  Oh, that's a lot.  Mixes.  But like, you know, he's a gentleman of a certain age at this point.  Yeah, yeah.  That one's like Triclon being in a club.  Oh, man.  I couldn't wait to say that.  Saving it since last night.  You don't think 40-year-olds should be DJing in clubs? 
[01:38:30]  He's good at what he does.  Put it aesthetically.  This was his big hit, Jim.  You know this one, right?  Yeah, everyone knows this one.  Cheering it up.  We've come a long, long way together  Through the hard times  I want to  You like Fat Boy Slim?  Yeah, Fat Boy Slim's pretty good.  I have to praise you like I should 
[01:39:00]  You don't know this, Jimmy?  Wow.  This was everywhere for about a year.  Yeah, this was huge.  This was everywhere.  And didn't he do that song that Christopher Walken danced in the hotel to?  Yes.  All right.  And then I guess you got Oasis, but it's not Oasis because the brothers hate each other.  They can't just get along.  It drives me crazy.  It really is infuriating. 
[01:39:30]  It's so stupid because, A, they're brothers.  You're supposed to figure that shit out.  And, B,  They have it.  They sing these really nice kind of love songs, but it doesn't make sense.  There's no love there.  But it's right there for you.  Just get along for a second, and you can have it.  So now instead of, and they can't, one guy, even though they're brothers, he can't use the Oasis name.  No.  Because they're fighting over that.  So now it's called BDI.  Nobody wants to hear BDI do Wonderwall, even though it's the same guy.  It's the same guy who sings Wonderwall, but now he has to sing it in a band called BDI. 
[01:40:00]  Because they're fighting.  Yes.  And the other Gallagher wasn't there.  You gotta have the both Gallagher brothers.  And the other Gallagher writes the songs.  Yeah.  And this guy sings the songs.  Wow, that's brutal.  So he's singing his brother's song, but he, I guess he doesn't hate him that much, that he's still singing his brother's song.  Right, he knows, he knows.  Which makes it so stupid.  They are stupid.  If you actually hated the guy, wouldn't you, like, say, fuck that, I ain't singing your fucking songs anymore?  Can you imagine having Oasis, that, like, you could be Oasis. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  It's there.  Just get along with that guy for a second, and you can have it.  And the weird thing is, it's not like, it's like the material's already created.  Right.  So you could just do material, that's why singers are so lucky.  You could just do shit that's been created.  Yeah.  And make a massive payday.  That would have been a massive thing for them to get back together.  Yeah.  I didn't know they broke up.  Oh, yeah.  So you did a tour?  But my point is, you don't hate him that much if you're singing the song he wrote. 
[01:41:00]  He knows, too.  Because he wrote all this stuff.  How does Wonderwall go?  Oh, my God.  I know it.  Here's BDI.  Ian Gallagher's band, founded by former members of Oasis.  Of course, the hit, Wonderwall.  Oh, yeah, he's playing a DJ.  Ryan Seacrest is enraging.  Whiny fuck. 
[01:41:30]  Is this BDI's version?  Was the queen there?  No.  And then the fucking queen doesn't even go to the closing ceremonies.  Just Prince Harry.  It's in your fucking town.  She don't care.  What a twat.  She don't care about none of that shit.  Right.  What did she care about then?  She probably heard it was BDI, not Oasis.  Yeah.  She's like, fuck that. 
[01:42:00]  I ain't going to BDI.  BDI.  Philip was watching her get fucking ATM'd by two different guys.  Being cuckled.  But you're listening to Oasis.  But he has to say BDI.  Ladies and gentlemen, BDI.  And you think his brother's just somewhere, like, throwing shit at the TV?  Oh, yeah.  Empty beer bottles at the TV.  Why are they fighting?  Does anyone know?  They've hated each other for a long time.  There's a montage of them hating each other.  It's great.  What do you mean?  A montage?  They've been hating each other for... 
[01:42:30]  Where's Travis?  He knows about this shit.  This is a video I saw.  I don't know which one now.  But it's a montage of them just totally not getting along in all these interviews.  Oh, really?  Yeah, man.  They could be making hundreds of millions of dollars together.  What year did they split up?  I know nothing about this band.  My friend Steve Byrne used to like this band.  That's the only thing I knew about them.  I like Oasis.  I like some of their stuff.  And I don't know much about them except for the fact they just fight all the time.  Do we have an interview with them?  I'd love to see it.  They're always breaking up, Jimmy, so I can't answer your question. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, they would get back together and make up?  Then they sort of get back together.  And then one guy would go, well, fuck this.  And he'll leave in the middle of a song.  Right.  Yeah.  They call 1999 to 2004 the transitional period.  I guess they were.  Yeah.  What do you know about Oasis, Travis?  BDI is Oasis without Noel Gallagher.  Right.  And where's Noel?  Noel left.  For what reason?  He hates.  Liam.  But they're brothers.  Exactly.  They're brothers.  They both got giant egos.  This guy, Noel, is the genius songwriter. 
[01:43:30]  And his stupid brother just sings the songs.  And he has to sit there and get none of the credit.  But Noel can't sing.  So they need each other.  He can sing.  He can't sing as well.  Right.  Like, there have been times where they've fought so bad that Liam won't go out on stage  and Noel will go out and sing the fucking songs himself.  What a couple.  What are they fighting about?  Everything.  Because, yeah, they fight about everything.  They've sued each other.  Is there a mom involved?  God, with jerk offs.  Is there a mom that gets in the middle and tries to get together? 
[01:44:00]  They're just bratty little brothers.  They are.  Yeah.  Just jerk offs.  Wait, so Liam will leave and say, fuck that, I'm not performing tonight.  And then Noel has to go on.  Oh, God.  That's what a scumbag.  Didn't they do that on stage once?  I think that was a MTV thing.  It wasn't an MTV Unplugged.  I think Noel Gallagher did the whole thing, I think.  And Liam was like, wasn't he throwing beer bottles from the audience?  Yeah, because they're little brats.  It's hysterical.  They are brats, aren't they?  Yeah.  Are they rich kids or no?  Well, they are now.  I don't know if they were.  I don't know.  What makes two guys such...  Especially to do that in front of the fans. 
[01:44:30]  It's like, just don't go do the gig then, you shitheads.  Wow.  Yeah, they...  I loved Oasis.  They were great.  Yeah.  What is another big song by them?  Oh, God.  Champagne Supernova?  Yeah.  You know that one.  What's the story?  Live Forever.  Live Forever.  Yep.  Their whole first...  The first...  They probably got about 10 songs you would know.  Leroy said they're playing jacks.  How about you find a fucking song you're on?  Champagne Supernova.  That's why it doesn't make sense that they beat each other. 
[01:45:00]  Which one is this?  This is Champagne Supernova.  No, which singer?  It's Lise.  Lillian.  They say you will find me caught beneath the last line.  In a champagne supernova.  Gratty Brothers is exactly what you are.  You've seen the show, I'm sure, Travis.  The Liam Gallagher TRL appearance?  Yeah, it's...  What's this one?  Like, it was so awkward because he wouldn't do the interview with Carson.  He just kept saying he was godlike.  Let me see this.  I think Liam's the problem. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  He's just off to the side without reacting.  What an asshole.  Godlike.  Godlike.  How are you feeling?  Godlike.  Good.  Thanks for coming by.  Glad you are.  What do you eat?  It's one of my missions.  I have to drop in on you every now and again.  Yeah.  We always like to see you here, too.  The fourth Oasis album.  Standing on the shoulder of giants.  Real big.  The stores now.  The cover of the album, New York Skyline.  Yeah, I thought I'd pay you respects enough before I'd blow you up or not, yeah?  Yeah.  That's what I thought the reason was. 
[01:46:00]  Why New York on the cover?  What is it about New York that you like so much?  I don't think you've got anything happening for you until you're out of it.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, what an asshole.  He's a jerk off.  Do you like coming to New York tonight?  I love it, yeah.  Yeah, what about you?  What do you do when you're here?  I just eat burgers, man.  And look at the skyline.  And especially like that thing over there.  That's over there.  Liam Gallagher.  Oh, yeah.  Did you see that up there?  I love it.  That's intuitive.  Just think, 365 shows.  I made that myself.  What a douchebag.  He thinks he's so interesting and weird. 
[01:46:30]  He thinks he's such a funny, quirky genius.  What a jerk off.  He's just a dick bag.  He's just really good at singing.  Can you find the unplugged?  What a jerk off.  Unbelievable.  Look how mysterious I am.  I'm crazy.  I'm fucking crazy.  Just saying crazy random things.  Look, LG.  I remember...  Uninteresting cunt.  I remember...  Carson Daly, by the way, did a good job with that awkwardness.  Yeah.  He kept it going.  He's a better interviewer than people think.  Oh, Carson's great.  He really knows how to, you know...  I remember them doing MTV News clips, showing them throwing bottles from the audience, but 
[01:47:00]  I don't know if they actually aired it on the other side.  It's such a great story.  It's so stupid.  Yeah.  You have Oasis there for you.  Right.  Basically, Oasis played at the closing ceremonies, but they have to come on.  So it's BDI-ish.  The guy who wrote the song wasn't allowed to.  BDI.  And I don't think we have any idea how massive they are over there.  Like, they're huge.  They're beyond huge over that.  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now. 
[01:47:30]  And all the roads behind the wall are whiting.  And all the lights are my way by saying.  He's whining.  Fucking whining.  Pretty.  Right.  There's no scene to be a big block, too.  This is a good boy. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  That good shit.  He's got to get mustard.  Someone Twittered me.  ABBA was offered almost a billion dollars, which I've heard.  ABBA refuses to play.  Who?  ABBA.  They refuse to play.  And they refuse to play. 
[01:48:30]  A billion?  Was it someone was fucking someone's wife or something?  What happened with that band?  No.  That you turned down a billion dollars to go out there and yell, ABBA-toon, ABBA-toon, ABBA-toon,  and then go to the hotel?  I've heard one of them is deathly afraid of flying.  I've heard the others are just incredibly private people now, and they just don't care.  Some people just don't care.  How about this?  If you're afraid of flying for a billion, get on a fucking boat.  But they might have more money than they could spend already. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, but it's not that they hate each other?  I don't know.  I was never an ABBA fan, so everything I'm saying...  Yeah, I know.  It's surprising, right?  But they've never officially broken up, but their last public appearance together was  in 1982.  Swedish supergroup, ABBA.  82?  That's 30 years ago.  And what's their reasoning for not doing gigs?  They make a shitload of money off their...  I guarantee at least one of them wants to do it.  Oh, I'm sure.  Sure, yeah.  All they've said is there's simply no motivation to regroup. 
[01:49:30]  Money is not a factor.  No.  And we would like people to remember us as we were.  Young, exuberant, full of energy.  Oh.  It's not the worst thing.  A lot of bands...  Because some of these bands you see, you're like, oh, fuck.  Now, for a billion dollars, you go out there old and fat and be remembered as old and fat.  It is...  Take your billion.  It is hard to...  Assholes.  Pull off that dancing queen thing when you're fucking 50.  Yeah.  You think Led Zeppelin regrets doing that one-off show a couple years ago?  It's terrible.  Yeah, see? 
[01:50:00]  Where was Zeppelin last night?  Yeah, see?  Where was Zeppelin?  Where's Sabbath?  Where was Robert Plant?  His own...  He can't sing those songs is where it's at.  Yeah.  Maybe Alison Krauss wasn't available.  Good one.  He sings with her a lot, right?  Yeah, that's how he does that.  Yeah.  He loves her.  Very successful.  Very successful...  My mom likes it now.  Duet.  Hmm?  My mom likes them now.  Really?  Great.  Robert Plant and Alison Krauss?  Well, she was Alison Krauss, so she's like, who's this Robert Plant guy?  Who's this Robert Plant guy?  Yeah.  She knows who Robert Plant is. 
[01:50:30]  Come on.  She's the cool mom.  She grew up in that time.  Of course.  I just want to talk about the Gallagher brothers for the rest of the morning.  That's amazing.  It's great.  They broke up like minutes before they were supposed to go on stage one night.  And that was it.  But that to me is why they're both such fucking hateable cunts.  That they would do that to a room full of fans.  Yeah.  That's why they're such fucking...  Great word, Travis.  Me.  Braddy brothers.  Me.  Their fans should just never, ever go and see them live.  Mm-hmm.  Never.  Don't you wish their music sucked?  Yeah, I really do, because they're great. 
[01:51:00]  Nah, I like it how it is.  What idiots.  They're just idiots.  I've always enjoyed the fighting.  Yeah.  Look for it on YouTube later if you're into it.  I mean, the montage of them fighting through all these interviews.  Oh, it's great.  Do we have any of that?  Stan is relaxing like he's fucking...  Like he's just YouTubing at home for the goof of us.  This is a job.  Liam said when...  Or Noel said when they broke up, he said,  I just couldn't work with them another day.  Wow.  And they just broke up.  Understandable.  Minutes before they were supposed to go on stage. 
[01:51:30]  That's why they're scumbags.  It's not understandable, because then they do get back together.  I don't know.  For like a day or two.  Have they...  When was the last time they performed together?  2009.  All right.  When they broke up.  It's been three years now.  All right.  This one might stick for a while.  Yeah.  They'll get back together.  So what is the other guy doing?  He has a band.  Noel Gallagher, he's got a band.  You're not really hearing a lot.  Why would you?  No one cares about it.  Is he singing Oasis songs that he wrote?  He might be.  I know that...  I know, to Liam's credit, 
[01:52:00]  he only just started singing Oasis songs.  And he said he's not...  You know why?  Because no one gives a fuck about BDI.  Exactly.  So he said,  Ah, fuck.  Now I've got to sing my brother's songs that I...  I hate them,  but I've got to do something to keep my popularity up.  That's why it's ridiculous.  BDI.  It's all for being musicians.  Now you've described the new album,  Heathen Chemistry,  as the second best album that you've ever done.  Do you think you'll ever write one as good as  Definitely May be again?  If anyone's going to do it,  he'll do it,  but I'm 35 now. 
[01:52:30]  You can't write songs like  Rock and Roll style,  Love Forever,  when you're my age.  Because I'd be faking it,  you know what I mean?  When I was writing Live Forever and Supersonic,  I was 21.  Jesus.  It's about life on the dole,  and if I started writing songs like that,  people would just see through it immediately.  You can only write about what you've expected  Do you honestly believe that, though?  As a songwriter,  can you only...  No, I'm lying.  No, no, no.  Of course I believe that.  But do you know what I mean?  Do you have to be feeling something  at the time to write?  I've got to be honest,  I've got to...  I can't write songs about being  young and unemployed 
[01:53:00]  and being 21,  because I'm not,  you know?  Might you write songs about me  being sweating on  and very good lucky?  Well, you know,  well, you're writing them about yourself,  so it doesn't matter, does it?  Is Oasis democratic,  or do you have the final say, or...?  Well, these lot would say...  I don't...  Well, you know...  Truthfully, no.  Truthfully,  well, they drop it all on me.  Right.  I've got to make all the tough decisions.  Yeah, they do.  Right.  All the things about,  like, you know,  should we get tea or coffee for the studio,  or should we have toast,  or beans on toast,  or digestives or chocolate ones?  Well, they'll drop that on me,  because that's important. 
[01:53:30]  You know what I mean?  Those are freaking out about biscuits.  You know what I mean?  And Liam's sitting there  just fucking stewing.  They're both douchebags,  both of them.  They're both douchebags.  The singers are...  The singers are fucking...  And by the way,  they're not rich kids.  They're talking about being on the doll.  They're broke.  They grew up poor.  The doll is like welfare.  And he's a...  The singer's a douchebag  because he's the singer,  and the other guy's a douchebag  because he's a jealous cunt,  but the other guy's the singer.  And they're just both jerk-offs. 
[01:54:00]  It's two giant egos.  It's one genius  and one incredibly famous lead singer.  You know?  Yeah, instead of realizing...  And they're brothers.  Liam hasn't written any of that shit?  I don't want to say that  because I don't know for sure,  but I know that Noel wrote  the absolute majority of those hits.  Do you think they see each other  at family functions or never?  Never.  They hate each other.  Yeah, if they don't see each other  in the Olympic closing ceremony.  I know we've got to move on, but...  I don't know how it started, but I mean...  No one knows how it started.  I mean, they're brothers, you know?  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Some brothers just, you know,  always have that sibling rivalry.  But then how are they able  to even just get a band together  to begin with?  Probably because at some point  they both recognize that, you know,  they've both got...  Bizarre.  Yeah, like, hey, let's start a band  and do it.  And they were probably poor  and they were hungry to be famous and stuff.  And then once they got famous,  they were both like,  fuck you, I'm the reason we're famous.  And they were great.  Oasis was great.  It's probably better that they...  Yeah.  They're probably putting shit now.  And what did George Michael do at the... 
[01:55:00]  Oh, he sang Freedom.  He did, huh?  Yeah.  With that Fu Manchu or something.  Yeah.  Did he?  Yeah.  He looked like he could have been  an old Backstreet Boy or something.  Yeah.  That fucking...  Somebody over here reminded him of...  What's his name from fucking The Office?  Gervais?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He didn't sound terrible.  Yeah, he was all right.  And then Freddie Mercury was on the screen.  Oh, no.  And everyone singing along to Freddie Mercury.  It wasn't a hologram, right? 
[01:55:30]  No, it was just the famous concert from 89,  I think it was.  Oh.  I felt bad.  All these kids were singing Imagine.  From Wembley.  Wembley.  All these kids were singing Imagine.  And then they went to a video  of John Lennon singing it.  And the video got way more applause  than the stupid kids did singing their line.  Well, yeah.  Like, that's when the pop came,  when the video came on.  Good.  All the kids were just like, oh.  What kids?  Their children are like...  Yeah.  Imagine all the people.  People. 
[01:56:00]  Anything else from the closing ceremonies?  No.  No.  That was about it.  Yeah.  Sounds great.  Imagine.  Oh, my God.  Look at George Weigel.  Oh, my God.  He looks good.  He looks like what he is, an old queen.  He looks his age.  He looks like Ringo there, doesn't he?  Yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah, he's got the Ringo look.  Wow.  He sang Freedom.  Did he sing it well?  Where was Ringo yesterday?  Ringo.  There were so many Beatles songs being played.  Oh, yeah.  With his all-star band.  Exactly. 
[01:56:30]  Ringo.  Yeah.  Counting his lucky stars, he was a Beatle.  Meanwhile, he was fucking answering his phone eight times a day, going, hello, and hearing  a click as Pete Best is continuing to call him and just hang up in his ear.  Poor Pete Best.  Pete Best.  Finding out all his new phone numbers and then calling him and hanging out.  Pete just calls him.  This comedian named Mick Leszinski, many years ago, I remember, he had a funny line, but 
[01:57:00]  he goes, do you think Pete Best, he goes, Pete Best left the Beatles.  Do you think Pete Best owns a machine that kicks him in the ass every morning?  A machine?  An ass-kicking machine?  Kicks him in the ass every morning?  That's got to be a regret.  Did they throw him out or did he leave?  The Beatles.  Pete Best was pretty much just blindsided.  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And there was another Beatle that died, right?  Yeah, Stuart.  Yeah, John.  No, before John.  Stuart? 
[01:57:30]  Sutcliffe, right?  What did he die of?  Brain aneurysm, I think.  Was that, now, before, after, like, but then there's rumors that John Lennon hit him over  the head with a hard object.  Oh, yeah?  Causing this, uh, fucking brain aneurysm.  There's all sorts of conspiracy theories with that one.  They might have been lovers, some would say.  Wow.  What did he die of?  I believe it was a brain aneurysm, right?  Yeah, something like that.  Ah, Sam's reading about Pete Best, you know?  Yeah, Sam's relaxing, having a good time.  He asked me three questions in a row. 
[01:58:00]  So, okay, multitask.  Focus, man.  Yeah, Sam's having a ball over there, just enjoying the internet.  I thought I was at home for a second.  Yeah, Gitchy's fucking got his feet up at the house.  We got info on the Gallagher brothers, why they hate each other.  Uh, Mike in Houston.  Just one, when I took the other one's acting.  Oh, wrong Gallagher.  Mike?  Yeah, hey, good morning.  Hiya, Mikey.  I read an article a while back by one of the band members.  The reason that they hate each other's guts is because Liam wrote all the lyrics and wrote  the music, and no one wanted a portion.  That's why after the first album, you see them switch the entire band. 
[01:58:30]  They don't even have the same band from the first album, which was Oasis.  But it all came down to money, just like with Led Zeppelin, or even the Beatles, where  Paul McCartney and John Lennon would fight over who would get their songs on album, because  they got all the money.  It's more than money, though.  Because one of the brothers is going into the audience in MTV Unplugged and heckling  his other brother in his own band.  That's a little more than just a lot.  Probably has a little to do with money, though, because if you're the songwriter, you're getting 
[01:59:00]  a lot more money.  You're getting a lot more than the lead singer, and the lead singer's like, hey, I should  be getting more, too, because I'm the one that's making your songs what they are.  Right.  And let's say they...  But also, don't forget about Clarence, that the black guy who was a member of the Beatles,  whenever you play the record backwards and you hear him talking...  What happened?  Your phone cut out, sir.  Hey, what about Clarence, who was with the Beatles, the black guy?  Can you play the records backwards and you hear him talking to him?  Dude, I...  Is there something about still in his music?  I keep...  I'm sorry, brother.  I keep hearing Beatles, but then you crap out for... 
[01:59:30]  You say something about...  And then it goes to the Beatles.  There was a black guy in the Beatles?  Hello, sir.  He's gone.  He's gone.  Because I fucked that noise.  We heard...  I was about to clear my throat.  We heard you, him.  Noel sings, Don't Look Back in Anger?  I didn't know that.  All right.  So he didn't...  So...  Noel...  Why do I hate them so much?  Wait, Noel sings all of them, right?  Now I'm confused. 
[02:00:00]  No, Liam.  Liam is a singer.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Noel could very well sing a lot of them.  But why don't they just split the money?  Like, when there's two of you, one sings, one writes, the songwriters shouldn't get more  in those situations, because your brilliantly written song would not be what it is without  this guy singing it.  Yeah.  So split it 50-50.  Don't be cunts.  What about 60-40?  People are just greedy.  They're fucking greedy.  They're nickel and indiming each other.  What's worse than being nickled and dimed?  I wonder.  Believe me, I know. 
[02:00:30]  But then you got a band like Avid that doesn't want to be greedy and you're mad at them.  Because it's a billion dollars?  Because the amount of money?  To go out and actually just perform and to turn down a billion dollars is fucking dumb.  The Smiths are the same way.  No one cares about them.  Yeah, a lot of people care about the Smiths.  Offered $5,000.  Exactly.  What do they want for the Smiths?  Here's 150.  Do that song.  What's their big song?  You don't know the Smiths?  Morrissey?  No, I don't.  Morrissey has said that he would rather get... 
[02:01:00]  What album, by the way, what album is Symptom of the Universe on?  See how that hurts?  All right, go ahead.  Point Jimmy.  Tell Jimmy the story of the Smiths.  Morrissey just has absolutely no...  That's a chick, Morrissey, right?  Morrissey?  Morrissey's not a chick.  Alanis Morrissey.  Oh, Morrissey.  Okay, I know the name Morrissey.  Yeah, Morrissey's a guy.  Right?  Morrissey has said that he would rather be castrated than ever get back with them. 
[02:01:30]  But in the UK...  But that's the reason why he's famous.  Yes, absolutely.  What's his song?  E-Rock, could you stop in there with the fucking playing jacks?  He was playing jacks a minute ago.  I know he was.  Chocolate-covered jacks.  I hear the ball bouncing, and I hear the scoop of metal.  I'm going to cut it out.  You got them all.  He's just bragging about getting twosies.  But Morrissey's...  Why Morrissey's song?  But he still sings...  The Smiths' song.  The Smiths' songs, right?  Oh, yeah, he sings the Smiths' all the time.  So that doesn't make sense.  If you hate it that much, then don't sing those songs anymore.  But especially in the UK...  But when it works in your favor, you're going to sing the songs, right? 
[02:02:00]  I fucking hate it like this.  I love the Smiths.  Never liked the Smiths?  No.  Make a good man turn bad.  Good man turn bad.  So please, please, please.  Right.  Fucking whinging.  Shut up.  Let me get what I want.  Who's listening to this?  This is horrible.  Travis, you're a fag.  I like the Smiths.  What are you going to do?  You're a fag.  Am I going to do fucking...  I don't know. 
[02:02:30]  Nothing.  I didn't have anything to say.  Travis likes songs that he can picture himself singing.  I like it a lot.  Like when Travis daydreams, he pictures himself singing this.  And he's like, Travis, you're both meaningful.  But why won't he get back together with the Smiths?  He just absolutely hates them.  But what's the problem there?  And also, he wants people to just stop thinking about the past.  Like, he's done so much since then.  Oh.  You know?  Oh, God forbid.  Regardless of whether or not it's been.  You're famous.  Successful.  Right.  You know? 
[02:03:00]  Some people just don't want to look back.  See, the thing is this.  Don't look back in anger.  Yeah.  I heard you say.  Singers have this weird thing where they resent when people want too much of the old  stuff.  But it's like they can...  But they have to...  Their voices have to be good.  And they have to usually look good.  It's harder for singers in that way.  But it's like, man, you could do the same songs forever.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Fuck up.  I'm getting word that David Byrne is the same way.  The rest of the Talking Heads wants to get back together and he's saying, nope. 
[02:03:30]  Hmm.  I was never a Talking Heads fan.  I like the Talking Heads.  I like one song by them.  Psycho Killer.  Psycho Killer.  I only remember there was a comedian who played guitar.  And I think his name was Spins Knightley from Philly.  And he used to do...  I believe he used to do a song parody of this.  I don't remember what it was.  I remember Let's Go Crazy Lenny Clark, who was a weird, crazy comedian, whose whole thing  he'd go, go crazy, Lenny. 
[02:04:00]  The crazier I go, the crazier you go, the crazier I go.  And they'd all go, go crazy, Lenny.  And he would do all this weird shit.  But he did a song called Psycho Chicken.  Where he would just throw chickens or something.  Oh, buck, buck, buck, buck.  Yeah.  That's Lenny.  Not Lenny Clark.  Lenny...  Yeah, it wasn't Lenny Clark.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Go Crazy Lenny.  Lenny Clark is from Boston.  This is Lenny...  Yes, Lenny Schultz.  Is this their biggest hit, you think?  This is a pretty big one.  Yeah.  But I think the other one, Burning Down House, is pretty fucking burning. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, God.  That's a bigger one.  That's bigger.  What about Once in a Lifetime?  That's a good one, too.  My personal favorite from The Talking Heads...  Which one's that?  ...at the bottom of the ocean.  Yeah.  Which one?  Once in a Lifetime.  I don't know.  I do like this song.  Qu'est-ce que c'est.  That's French.  He's a New Yorker, right?  David Byrne?  It's part of the art scene.  He's really into the art scene.  Here's a weird...  This is Once in a Lifetime. 
[02:05:00]  This reminds me of a weird moment like a 1983 movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very.  Like where the drug dealer's coming back.  You may find yourself living in a shotgun shack.  You may find yourself...  You may find yourself...  In another post...  This was an early MTV video.  Oh, yeah.  They play this one a lot.  Oh, hell yeah.  1980, Sam.  1980.  This song holds up.  Oh, yeah.  I like this one. 
[02:05:30]  This song's 32 years old.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wow, they were big.  Yeah.  Is David Byrne the lead singer?  Oh, yeah.  They had a shitload of hits.  Yeah.  Some people just don't want to get back.  I guess so.  Axl Rose, when this whole Hall of Fame thing was going on last year, you know, a lot of  people give him shit, but he was honest, and he said, you know, sometimes divorces just  happen, and sometimes there's no happy ending, and you've got to respect it. 
[02:06:00]  I kind of respected Axl because the statement he released was not some rambling idiocy.  He just doesn't want to do it for whatever reason, and Eddie Trunk made some good points  about how the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame put them in just so they could get this big hit  like, we got G and R back together, and then Axl was like, oh, fuck yourself, and didn't  do it.  So the Rock and Roll Hall didn't get what they wanted, so fuck them.  David Byrne looks exactly like David Byrne, just with gray hair.  Yeah.  It's fucked up.  He looks exactly like it, but just gray hair. 
[02:06:30]  Some guys, they just age in their hair.  That's it.  Weird.  Face stays the same.  Yeah.  Nah, I like the talking heads.  Yes.  What a Morrissey.  Yeah, you know, everybody's got their opinion.  Fuck Morrissey.  How's that early emo shit?  Oh, Morrissey?  Yes, it is not emo.  Well, it was emo before emo.  I want...  What do you want?  What do you want?  I want a teat to suck you.  That's hilarious.  Look at him. 
[02:07:00]  Take Me to the River.  We won't forget there, John Fox.  Oh, that's a good one.  John Fox of Brooklyn.  What's that song?  I don't know that.  Take Me to the River.  You rock, please, while you're in there.  Stop fucking around.  Playing games.  He was playing dominoes a second ago.  Of course he was.  Road to Nowhere.  That's a lot of hits by these guys.  This is a cool song, too.  Yeah, this is a good one.  I like these motherfuckers.  Does he play these songs? 
[02:07:30]  I don't even know if he...  Does he perform, even?  Billy the Big Mouth Bass sang this song.  The fish.  Well...  Push the button.  The fish turns around and sings...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's so bad.  That's how you know this song?  It's not the real one.  Like, if you buy it at Walmart, it sings a song to you.  It's the same one as the Sopranos, yeah.  That was a great, recurring, weird theme in his nightmares about Big Pussy.  Yeah.  The singing fish. 
[02:08:00]  Remember when he smashed it?  When he saw it?  When he freaked out?  Yeah.  That was a great thing that a dream would have in it.  A singing fish.  Yeah.  Strange.  They did amazing dream sequences in the Sopranos.  The best.  They were very realistic.  Like, that's how you dream.  Like, you're in a car.  Yeah.  You're walking on this weird dock.  Hey, guys.  Like, this really weird isolation that dreams have. 
[02:08:30]  The Sopranos was a really well-written show.  Yeah, it really looked good.  Those dream sequences.  Yeah.  Fucking creepy.  Because you didn't know it was a dream.  Yeah.  And you go, oh, you're blowing.  And you know, it's snowing and he's on fire.  Like, oh, boy, that's a dream.  David Byrne's last show was in 2009, but half of them were Talking Heads songs.  Well, he's not doing shows?  No.  What's he doing?  He's an art guy.  Oh, okay.  I think he's rich.  I tried reading an article on him, and it was boring.  But basically, he's into the whole New York art scene. 
[02:09:00]  I hate art time.  I hate the art scene.  You wouldn't be a fan?  Hey, that thing you painted.  Hey, look at it.  Oh, what did you paint?  Just stop it.  All right, should we break?  Take pictures of it, look at it online, and shut your face.  What is there an art scene?  I don't know.  Hey, you want to get together and just look at these things?  Why do I need you there?  Just fucking send me a photo.  I'll just look at it later.  It's a place to be seen, though. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, it's terrible.  You're in a gallery.  You're just having some wine.  You're dressed up a little wacky because you're part of the art scene.  And part of the art scene.  You want a mimosa?  Whatever it is, a fucking fruits drink.  You don't like looking at art?  No.  Have some cheese and a mimosa.  Blues and a red.  You don't like looking at art?  No, I don't.  I hate modern art.  I'll look at art for a second.  What's that?  Wow, that's cool.  Done.  That's it.  You don't like soak it in? 
[02:10:00]  No.  If you stand in front of a painting for more than eight seconds, you're a douchebag.  What do you think it means?  What, you mean that circle in the corner with a bunch of red splot?  It means nothing, asshole.  It means nothing.  You want to sit there interested in what the artist is trying to say?  No.  Yeah, you know who I'm interested in what he has to say?  Norman Rockwell.  Hey, what's he saying?  I guess that kid's running away because the cop's talking to him and he's got a runaway bag.  Next picture. 
[02:10:30]  Give me a book of art and I'll flip through it.  I admire art, but to stand there in a fucking white-walled gallery and just stare at it like a pompous douche while you're looking to feel something.  You wouldn't go to an art museum just to check out what human beings could do?  If my other option is having my testicles stepped on, I would go to the art museum after careful consideration.  What about a photography exhibit?  Yeah, I like good photography. 
[02:11:00]  Although Instagram is proving anyone could do it.  Those guys just happen to have the filters way before we did.  Instagram and Snapseed.  Huh?  Instagram and Snapseed.  Snapseed's the best.  Oh, can I make everything look amazing?  Snapseed's editing.  But these are all tools the professional photographer had.  That's all.  I like a good picture, though.  You pretty much realize anyone has a good picture.  That's art, though.  I know.  It is.  You've got to get lucky with photography, though. 
[02:11:30]  Photography captures weird...  There's a great picture of Malcolm X.  It's the most famous picture of him standing in the window.  With a gun.  And looking out the window.  And it's such an amazing photo.  Because you know turmoil's happening.  Yeah.  But it just kind of takes you to that place.  Like a great photo.  Obviously, after World War II, that picture.  Some great photos.  Yeah, I admire good art.  Yeah, yeah.  Photos like that.  I mean, you wonder what's going on there.  But I know I'm looking at Malcolm X with a gun. 
[02:12:00]  If that was just a silhouette, and with no room behind it, just a blue background, what's going on?  Who cares to cut out of a person?  I care because it's Malcolm X.  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't care if it was fucking...  I had to guess what it was.  Yeah, true.  What's that?  He's got...  Well, look at...  Well, the four lines of blue represent the little green in the corner, which means that there's a circle.  Go fuck yourself.  You know how you find out what the artist was saying?  Come here for a minute.  What the fuck does that mean? 
[02:12:30]  And he'd go, I don't know.  I just like the green in the corner.  I don't disagree with you.  Modern art is fucking...  That's...  That's...  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck's going on.  You don't want to look at that?  American Gothic?  I'm not saying I wouldn't look at it.  Here's how I look at it.  Wow, look at that.  Guy's got a pitchfork and an ugly wife.  Next picture.  I'm done with it.  Yeah, we'd have seen that on our big trip.  Why wouldn't you go and see that?  Because I just saw it here without having to fucking get a cab.  That's why.  Wow, that's nice.  Done.  Why is that such a famous painting?  Does anyone know?  Because it's famous. 
[02:13:00]  That's it, right?  Yeah.  And then the artist doesn't make any money because you're worth way more when you die.  I guess they captured something.  And then they finally start selling your shit.  Whistler's mother.  Which one?  The Scream is a great one.  By the way, there's actually...  I saw a photo recently where The Scream is actually supposed to take place.  And it was an interesting article, like in Time or whatever.  But I mean, that painting, I don't know why it's famous.  We all know it, but why?  Why do we know that one over hundreds of other Ferris Bueller pictures?  Thousands of other paintings.  Yeah, that is the Ferris Bueller picture, huh? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, it's a nice picture.  Look, I get it.  That's nice.  It looks like something on the cover of The New Yorker in 1920.  Who gives a fuck?  They're enjoying the river.  Yeah, that's nice.  Was that painted in Chicago?  Oh, yes.  Probably not.  It's probably just in the museum.  That's just like the movie.  Why is there a close-up of the kid?  It's from the movie.  He's doing a Ferris Bueller.  Okay.  Ah, look at the kid.  You're puzzling when you look close.  Sure.  There's some titties.  Oh.  Titties.  Oh, titties. 
[02:14:00]  That's modern art, right?  That's like pop art.  Pop art.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Oh, pop art.  That means moms can't enjoy it.  Chipy, don't play that.  Chip's back.  All right, y'all.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll talk about art and other things.  Take a break.  Chop, chop.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel. 
[02:14:30]  On Sirius XM.  Show me penis!  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Listen to this one.  I went to Iowa.  Dubuque, Iowa.  We roll up to this gorgeous hotel.  Gorgeous hotel.  The kid comes up to me.  He's got a camera.  And he goes, Brewer, your dad has to go. 
[02:15:00]  He has to go now.  And I know I've got about five seconds to get him out in the toilet or it's over.  So I go there.  I open the door.  When I open the door, there's shit on my fingers.  So I'm like, what is this?  So I'm looking at his hands.  I can't understand where it came from.  It's not on his hands.  And it's fresh.  And I can't tell where it's coming from.  So I pull him up.  And as I pull him up, I put him in the wheelchair.  And I'm looking.  I don't see nothing.  So I roll him in.  And as I'm checking, I can smell it. 
[02:15:30]  So I'm like, oh, man.  I see people looking.  And I look at him.  He's got shorts on.  And I don't know how I missed it.  There's clumps of dung just hanging at his shorts.  I finally get up the stairs and I'm showering.  But when I went downstairs, where I took him out of the car, there's a pile that must have  fell out of his shorts.  And it's on the sidewalk.  It's such a surreal moment in life to see, like, where we go in life.  It's just, there's a billion flies all over this thing.  And people are just staring at me going, I can't believe someone let their dog just 
[02:16:00]  defecate on the sidewalk.  Stay tuned for more Bedtime Stories with Jim Brewer.  Oh, he's older than the teachers.  And he makes more money than the whole school.  He's an alcoholic.  He's Anthony.  He's the oldest kid in class.  He gets them drugs and fucks their hineys.  His big delicious cock shouldn't be black.  It's not. 
[02:16:30]  He's Anthony.  Oh, he carries a Trapper Keeper full of Hitler photographs.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  He tries to be everyone's friend, but he gives all the girls the creeps.  They think he's somebody's father who just showed up for no reason.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  Series action.  Series XM.  The opening entry show.  This is a good one, too. 
[02:17:00]  I'm going to get some of this and download it. 
[02:17:30]  What year do you think this is?  85?  Maybe 84, 83.  Oh, yeah.  I think this is later 80s.  Is it?  Yeah.  I think so.  I don't know.  Sam, could you look up Spins Nightly?  In quotes.  Danny, in quotes.  And CBGB and OMFUG.  That's all one word on Twitter there.  That's his Twitter account.  It says, you're right about David B., David Burns.  He's crazy and doesn't give a shit about money, but he likes his bicycle. 
[02:18:00]  Oh.  He's a bicycle advocate.  He loves biking around the city.  I hate advocates, if any.  Why?  I don't like people that have advocates.  They just talk too much about one thing.  Yes, you're an advocate.  I'm a bike advocate.  Everybody is.  He will chew your ear off about bikes.  Not mine, he wouldn't.  But most people will stick around because they go, wow, that's David Byrne.  I don't give a fuck if he's talking about bikes because, holy shit, he's talking to me.  Do you know how much pollution...  Shut up.  Shut up already. 
[02:18:30]  How much pollution has been caused people going to your concerts?  Fuck yourself.  Don't look at a painting, you bore.  Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.  I know what a bike is.  Left pedal, right pedal, left pedal.  Continue.  It's fucking...  Jimmy, now that you've shown us all that you really enjoy good art, we found another  one for you.  Oh, good.  You want to show them the other one there, Danny?  What do you think of that?  That's art.  Exactly.  Just a photo of New York and the Snapple sign.  I know exactly where...  It's not art if I recognize where it is because I've been there. 
[02:19:00]  Well, this is Times Square.  It's right outside our building, but there's something very special about what you're looking  at.  You took the picture?  No.  No, it's...  Oh.  It's a real artist.  Let me see.  I just take pictures.  There's something about it that's special.  Very special.  Oh, okay.  What?  I'm just saying that to your statement.  I don't see it.  Is there anything that's superimposed on there?  It'll blow you away.  You can't figure it out?  It's...  Wait.  It's Times Square, right outside this building, pretty much where we broadcast. 
[02:19:30]  Very close.  What is this, like 48 or 49, somewhere around there?  Maybe 47?  49.  49?  Yeah, it's right by the...  It's right by that there train there.  Yeah.  On 7th Avenue.  So, I'll give you like one more minute to try to figure it out.  Now, give me a hint because I'm...  Well, it is what it is.  What do you think?  I can't give you a hint.  I think it takes more talent than you just imagine, like, you know.  It takes more talent than just framing and snapping a picture. 
[02:20:00]  I don't know if this is famous, but it shows talent, yes.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I don't know if I give up.  That is a painting.  It's a painting.  It's not a photograph.  Well, that's great.  That is pretty goddamn great.  That's great.  What is it called, Danny?  Well, this artist...  The style is called hyper-realism.  Yeah.  I actually went to a gallery to check this shit out.  It'll blow your mind.  You're like, there's no way that's a painting.  Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.  And considering that the one that we were just looking at, I mean, it's a pretty...  There's a lot going on. 
[02:20:30]  It's Times Square.  It's a bunch of people walking around.  You got cars.  You got...  Buildings and signs.  Yeah, you got your typical Times Square scene, but that was painted.  And the original, it says here, is 11 by 14.  So, you can imagine, like, how do you create so much detail in such a small, small...  That's very...  Well, it's easier than a big one, because a big one, you probably go, that's a fucking painting.  But look at it...  You look at it closely, you would swear that was a photograph.  That's great.  Is that a painting, too?  Yeah, these are all paintings.  Wow.  I like that.  Well, it would be easier to just take a picture.  If you could go to a... 
[02:21:00]  He's an asshole.  That's hilarious.  What an idiot.  Just take a picture.  How about you show a bunch of people on the moon or something, go to McDonald's?  That's a cool painting.  That's fucking amazing right there.  These are paintings.  That's a painting.  That's not a painting.  That was actually...  It looks like a painting, but it's not.  That's a painting.  It's a girl in the shower...  That's amazing.  ...looking through the shower.  The door, kind of.  To me, this is great art.  Let me see those tits.  These are great art.  And these guys are starving.  Look at all the talent these guys have, and they don't make any money off this, for the  most part.  What is this through the shower door thing?  That's her thing. 
[02:21:30]  That's her thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She does self-portraits all the time, so...  That's pretty cool.  Those are actually her titties that she painted.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she probably just takes a picture and copies it.  Big fucking deal.  Big fucking deal.  Show me a chick taking a shower with fucking stars falling on her from the moon.  Stars from the moon?  Danny, the one with her in the water with her head popping out?  That's a painting?  Yes.  Which, this one right now?  Go down.  It was a little further down.  Page two.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Posh.  Keep going.  Keep going.  It was that one.  No, the one below it.  Right there.  That's a painting? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Get the fuck out.  That's some pretty realistic ones.  I know, that's very visual, but they obviously look like just photographs.  I just don't understand it.  I love stuff like that.  That's great.  I went to a show down in Soho.  It was a gallery, and I'm telling you, next time this is something you should check  out, you'd be blown away.  Who's a really famous one?  I'm going to commission them to paint me something.  Damn.  That's pretty good.  I want to paint...  Ow, it looks like a fucking chick's tits in the water.  Wow.  Why not just take the picture?  You can put your chin on her cunt. 
[02:22:30]  I want to commission somebody to paint me something.  That's just an amazing...  That one's not that good.  Like, to be able to get the scale of everything right, and the positioning, and the shadows...  Hey, fucking copy a picture.  Big deal.  You got the Starbucks one still, Danny?  That's way back to me.  Hang on.  All right.  Almost there.  There was one with Starbucks.  Look at this one, Jimmy.  Which the hell one was it?  Don't move on.  Shit, man.  I've got to find which one it was.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no. 
[02:23:00]  I guess...  Oh, no.  I don't remember which one it was.  I know what I want.  Ah, shit.  Look, that's a...  That's a painting, Jimmy.  Cab going down the street in New York.  That's unbelievable.  It looks like a painting, though.  There's something about the cab being...  Does that look like a painting?  The left wheel of the cab looks wrong.  It looks like it's floating.  Oh, yeah?  There's a texture.  You know, I thought you were fucking around, but you're absolutely right.  Fuck that guy, then.  You're absolutely right.  He's fucked up the left wheel.  Yeah, exactly.  What's that called?  Fucking Broadway in space?  Where the fucking half the tire is weighed down? 
[02:23:30]  This is great.  Here's what the cab would look like if it was driving over fucking the moon.  You know, you're right.  The left wheel was fucked up.  Exactly.  Everything else was perfect.  I would love to tell him that, because it would ruin that picture for him.  That's all he'd see when he saw it.  Oh, that's really funny.  Is there anything wrong with this one?  No, but there was one thing in that first one.  There was the people in the front.  There was something about the positioning of their feet that bothered me.  And that's why I thought there's something with the light, because the shadows.  There was no shadows.  This guy doesn't paint shadows.  What is it, every day cloudy in this cocksucker's life? 
[02:24:00]  How about a shadow once in a while?  Fuck.  What is this guy?  Man, great artist.  He's like, here's everything, except for the sun, which gives us life.  I'm going to take the sun away and hide it.  You make a good point.  None of these paintings are incredibly sunny days.  No, they're not.  What is this guy from Seattle?  Fuck him.  It leaves you light shadows.  I found the Starbucks one.  Yeah, the Starbucks one is great if it's shot in a Hollywood set.  This is called Glass Ground.  There's a bunch of glass on the ground.  I've seen this style where it's a bright, sunny day, and that's when you're like, how is that a painting? 
[02:24:30]  Can you find one of those, Danny?  It's a pile of garbage.  It's great.  All his paintings should be in there.  How about a shadow?  It's the Tippy Tom Mansion.  Yes.  No shadows at all.  That's where this guy should be fucking.  His name is his book.  Should we call a world without shadows?  Floating tire idiot.  You know, the guys went to the art museum in Chicago, the first Bueller Museum. 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  That's a great place.  It's the Art Institute of Chicago.  Just a ton, an absolute ton of artwork.  I mean, it doesn't even matter if you're into it either, because there's enough real famous shit that you could just look at and go, oh, I've seen that.  You know, like American God flick.  You know that.  And that classic painting of, it's like a diner, or it used to be a diner in the East Village, that long window.  I mean, the original is there, so at least there's things that you look at.  But every time I see that in a museum, I go, oh, that's a copy of the famous painting. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's the one you want to see.  And then you go, holy shit.  No, that's the actual original.  Right.  You're sitting there looking at American God.  I'm like, I've seen this a thousand times.  But your jaw's on the floor, because that's the one.  Is that Avril Lavigne right there?  Where?  Is that a painting of her?  Who this?  Yeah.  No.  It looks like her.  It looks like Avril Lavigne.  It looks like a painting, though.  But it's pretty good.  It's a great painting.  It looks like a painting, though.  It's a really good painting.  Porcelain Bell Face.  Digital art.  Digital art.  Digital art.  Why don't they stop with that?  Jimmy gets so annoyed. 
[02:26:00]  Fucking shit.  Why do you get annoyed, though?  Can I see the Coke cans?  What is that?  Jimmy rolls.  What is that?  It's Coke cans.  It's another hyper-realistic painting.  Is that really a painting?  Yeah.  Apparently, yeah.  Fucking amazing.  With the exception, of course, of the Coke on the left, there's something crooked about  the fucking reflection, which is just not right.  It looks uncomfortable.  You'd be a horrible art critic.  Oh, my God.  I'd be great, though.  I'd say everything that they were thinking.  I think you could work for the New York Times immediately.  Yeah.  You're very picky.  Yes, I am.  That's good.  Some of these are just not right. 
[02:26:30]  You just get blown away looking at this stuff.  Yeah, like, why would anybody paint half a face with a mustache?  Who wasted their time doing that?  It looks like a painting, too.  It's not good enough to be fucking realistic art.  Neither is that one.  That one is.  That one looks like art.  A little too fucking close together.  What about that guy on the park bench?  Cool.  Again, another guy with weird foot positioning.  And no shadows.  Dumb banana feet.  That's the same guy.  That's the same guy that we saw before.  Oh, another cloudy day.  That's not a painting.  It's paintings.  No way.  That old black man's a painting? 
[02:27:00]  Let me see.  All right.  What's wrong with that one, Jimmy?  That doesn't look like a painting at all.  It's not in a coffin.  That's a good one.  His hands are a little weird.  Like, I'll say this.  His fingers.  I don't like the fucking short fingers.  Yeah.  There's something about his fingers that are wrong.  The guy should have just fucking put his hands behind a sign or something.  But what if that's just what his hand looked like?  What if he just had little shitty hands?  He does have shitty hands.  Maybe.  That's a hair, by the way, I think.  That face is amazing.  That's great.  That's pretty good. 
[02:27:30]  That's really great.  Like, what is on that?  What is that person squinting into the sun?  Yeah.  They're probably saying something like, I can't stop painting me.  That's a painting right there?  Come on.  Yeah.  Old cunt by car.  So what?  It's an old lady by a fucking plastic looking car.  It looks like a painting.  Yeah.  The one above it was a little better.  Pretty impressive.  That's great.  That's the fucking shake.  That's called, there's five glasses with water just jostling out of the top.  And it's called the Eric Walks by Water table.  Sorry, Eric. 
[02:28:00]  He rocks shaking his head.  I know.  I love him.  But that's good.  How was the first Bueller Museum?  That's cool, too.  Sam, there's a story there, isn't there?  Where's Roland, by the way?  Why hasn't Roland talked about the Chicago trip yet?  Get Roland in here, too, please.  That's a painting?  I mean, wow, that's a painting.  The second one looks like it, but the first one doesn't.  Hey, for the people out there that don't know this shit, Danny, what is it called again?  So they can look up some pictures.  Yeah, if it is Google Image, it's just hyper-realism, and you'll just see a whole, and then once  you start clicking on one image, just go to the site, and then you can start looking 
[02:28:30]  at people's works.  And I just said pictures.  They're all paintings.  Yeah, they're very, very interesting if you're into that kind of thing.  A lot of them really, really well thought.  And even if you're not, they're just amazing to look at.  Of course.  Sam, first Bueller Museum.  They were annoyed up there in Chicago?  Well, it's not the Ferris Bueller Museum.  It's the art museum.  But I will take the other side of the argument.  You know how many people go to that museum that wouldn't because it was featured in Ferris  Bueller?  Four.  A lot more people.  Danny, you went because it was featured in Ferris Bueller?  Well, absolutely.  I knew that painting was there, and then they happened to have other shit, too, that I was 
[02:29:00]  interested in.  But absolutely, if I had not ever seen Ferris Bueller, I probably wouldn't.  Yeah, there's a lot of people that are going, you know what, fuck, let's go.  It was featured in Ferris Bueller.  Roland walked, first he, as soon as we got there, he walked up to a guy that worked there  and just said, excuse me, sir, where's the Ferris Bueller stuff?  Oh, no.  He was like, what are you talking about?  But if I ran the museum, I would make a Ferris Bueller.  Most of it's gone.  Well, why would you do that?  Because it's a 30-year-old movie, and they're trying to have an art museum. 
[02:29:30]  They can't spare one stupid room.  It's not the Hard Rock.  It's an art museum.  But they should spare one stupid room and go, all right, for you idiots, here's your Ferris  Bueller stuff.  Why would you ever take it out of the museum?  Because they got Planet Hollywood for that.  They're actually trying to show off art here.  Well, how about they at least show the fucking pictures that Jeffrey Jones had on his hard  drive from Ferris Bueller?  He's trading with Pee Wee.  Whoopsie, right?  The jig is up.  Roland goes up to the information desk with an old lady sitting there. 
[02:30:00]  And he's got a screenshot, because E-Rock is so obsessed with this whole dumb thing  that he had screenshots of the movie on his phone so he could match it and take the  photos in the museum.  As the guys.  Who played Ferris?  I don't know.  Who played Ferris?  That would be Roland.  Roland played Ferris.  So wait, you actually have shots of you lined up like idiots?  Yeah.  E-Rock, you wanted to go to this?  E-Rock, can you show the picture, please?  Do you like Ferris Bueller?  I'm going to put him up right now.  Do you have bedroom eyes in it? 
[02:30:30]  No.  Where are you going to put him up?  I'll put him up on our Facebook.  No, these guys want to see it.  I don't have him on a phone right now.  They're on the hard drive.  So you guys took this photo.  Oh, no.  Yes.  That's the photo that you took, where it's Ferris and Sloan and Cameron with their arms  crossed.  Except Cameron is in the background.  Except Cameron is in the back, played by Sam Roberts, looking very annoying instead  of having his arms crossed.  Why doesn't he have the pictures?  They were on your phone yesterday.  No, they weren't.  They were on my camera.  Ooh.  They weren't on the phone.  You know what? 
[02:31:00]  You're right.  You're right.  So I'm putting him up right now so you can see it.  So I'm putting him up right now so you can see it.  So I'm putting him up right now so you can see it.  No, but I thought he was lying.  Did you do that one?  They were on the phone.  No, I want you four people apparently that does exist.  And he went up to this lady with the screenshot on the phone and he goes, excuse me, miss, do  you know where these paintings are?  It's from the movie Ferris Bueller.  But what's wrong with that?  And she goes, well, who's the artist?  And he goes, no, no, no.  I don't know.  It's from Ferris Bueller.  Oh, God.  By the way, the artist was Picasso.  Like, what are you doing?  It was Picasso. 
[02:31:30]  By the way, Sloan, what year was Ferris Bueller?  1987.  Is this 87?  I hope I'm right.  Let's see.  I thought it was earlier.  It was a huge movie.  There's nothing wrong with going in there and asking these types of questions.  What, Jimmy?  Sloan is such an 80s name.  Isn't that an 80s name for a girl?  Sloan.  26 years ago.  Wow.  Do you have a kiss for Diddy?  For Diddy?  So, Sam, you're bothered by the Ferris Bueller talk?  Yeah.  I mean, it's an art museum.  But you go to Chicago. 
[02:32:00]  You're going to go to the Married with Children fountain.  I didn't want to do any of that stupid stuff.  It's called the Married with Children fountain.  Here's what happened.  I don't care what they call it.  Here's what happened.  I didn't want to go to see any of that stupid stuff because I thought it was stupid.  And Roland goes, here's what we're going to do.  We'll go to, because I was like, let's just go to Comic Con.  And he goes, okay, we'll go to Comic Con.  That's not stupid.  I was just going to say that.  That's not stupid.  It's the same type of weird, quirky shit.  I love what people hold to themselves.  Right.  You know, it's just like, here's Sam who likes wrestling and Dr. Pepper.  Right.  He's just like, art museums are fucking stupid. 
[02:32:30]  Art museums aren't stupid.  Going to see it for a movie is.  Like, we live in New York and we're not going to the Empire State Building.  Yeah, but maybe I never knew about that painting until I'd seen Ferris Bueller.  Just because I discovered it through a movie doesn't make it any less valid.  You went to the art museum and looked at art.  I sure did.  Roland and Eric went to the art museum to reenact the movie.  Just to look at, you know, I got you.  And then they left after they looked at it.  But you're like, holy shit, that's the painting they use at Ferris Bueller.  Why not?  Danny actually had an appreciation for the art. 
[02:33:00]  I don't have a problem with that.  I have a problem with just going and looking for a movie set.  I have a problem with the fact that your fucking thumb skin is really uncomfortably ill-fitting to your thumb.  When you look at Sam, it looks like Sam is fucking wearing a giant glove that's too big for him.  Look at his thumb skin when his hand's bent.  It's fucking awful.  Look at his thumb skin.  I'll work on my thumb skin, man.  It fucking stinks.  He's got really long thumbs.  His thumb skin bugs me.  With an extra large thumb cover.  Did you find all your Ferris Bueller stuff? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, we went in.  No, you didn't because they took most of it out.  Yeah, well, the last guy was very, very upset.  I said, well, why isn't there?  He goes, sir, we renovated this place three times since the movie.  Oh, man.  You know what that is?  It's a guy that hated the fucking movie.  No, it was also a guy who gets asked that all the time.  Tough shit.  He was so annoyed.  People are going to Chicago and they're going to go check that out.  He goes, that's a statue of Adam.  I went, oh, whatever.  Is it still around?  He didn't not like me. 
[02:34:00]  Well, a couple of things were still there.  Yeah.  Yeah, a few things.  So what was he missing about?  Then we went to see the mirror being, and Sam wasn't happy with that either.  Why?  Why weren't you happy with that?  That's a big tourist attraction, too, in Chicago.  What is?  I don't know.  What is it called?  The mirror being.  I just don't understand why go to tourist attractions.  I mean, you live in New York and you don't go to tourist attractions.  Why go to Chicago and go to tourist attractions?  I am a tourist attraction.  You went to the Sky Deck.  That was cool.  Well, that's because it's actually an experience.  It's not just looking at a big...  Well, that's an experience for people. 
[02:34:30]  Oh my God, it's a big glass ball.  It's a bean.  What's that from?  Nothing.  I like how it just keeps going, it's a bean.  It's a bean.  It's a bean.  It's a bean.  It's a big bean.  It's a bean.  You don't get the opportunity to roll it.  It gives you a weird reflection, I guess.  I don't know.  How great would that be to fucking push down a hill?  Is that an art project?  Of course.  I don't know.  I would assume it is.  I think it's owned by the Art Institute of Chicago.  I think it's on their property.  What's the problem with it, Sam?  Well, I don't have a problem with it existing, but I don't have any interest in going to 
[02:35:00]  see stuff that's just there as a tourist attraction.  Yeah.  Like, why?  Because you're a tourist.  Well, I mean, that fountain is pretty impressive, regardless of what TV opening it was from.  It's just a fountain, though.  I don't care about fountains.  It's just water 75 feet in the air, I learned.  Yeah, but that's a great little spot, too, just to chill out.  I mean, it's kind of like their little Central Park.  It's nice.  Meanwhile, if it was a fucking piece of Hulk Hogan's elbow skin, he's standing in line to see  it like it was Muhammad's beard hair. 
[02:35:30]  True.  Wait, the pictures you took are up there now, Ero?  There's Bulatorism.  Wait, wait, where is it at?  It's on our Facebook.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Like us, please.  Let's see what this is all about.  Where they reenacted the photographs.  Uh-oh.  I typed something wrong.  Not found.  No, that's me.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, Danny.  All right.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, Sam.  All right, let's...  And he calls it the Ferris Bueller tour.  Well, that's what it was. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, nice.  You're going to speak.  Eroch, why do you like Ferris Bueller so much?  Did you kind of wish that would be you and your girl again?  You guys fucked up the shot.  You totally fucked it up.  Hold on.  Go back.  How did you do it wrong, Eroch?  How did you do it wrong if you had the screen cap?  The room has...  All these rooms have changed since the movie.  Right.  So we just had to do the best we could.  Well, you did a lousy job.  You couldn't find one wall?  Hold on.  I was going to say, the original doesn't have a window.  Yours has a window.  You could have made sure you didn't have a window.  Which one are you talking about? 
[02:36:30]  Sam wasn't crossing his arms either.  No, I was kidding.  Your picture stinks.  It's cancer cancer.  I couldn't find the room that all that stuff was.  So you did it with a window?  We did it right next to the statue that was in the movie.  Oh, no.  It's the wrong spot.  Well, where is the fucking statue?  Go back to the original.  Let me tell you.  This picture sucks so much that someone looking at it wouldn't even know what you were.  Wouldn't even know.  They just go, oh, there's three idiots looking at something.  And Sam's not even playing along.  Everyone else is folding their arms.  You're not.  Let me see the original.  I didn't like it when my mom did it when I was a kid. 
[02:37:00]  Why would I like it when E-Rock's doing it?  Where's the art, E-Rock?  Where's the art in this fucking picture?  E-Rock, you're not even close to the original.  Unbelievably bad.  What a terrible job you did.  The floor is different.  Well, how about you start with a close-up like the original is?  Yours is a faraway shot.  You do understand, you can do that in here and make it look better.  Right.  Yeah, because I'm taking the fucking photo.  We have to hand it off to somebody.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, but why don't you tell the guy taking the picture?  You've got to get closer.  He was Chinese.  He didn't know what the fuck I was saying. 
[02:37:30]  He was playing a joke.  Those people don't know how to work the camera.  Are you kidding me?  Me destroy a picture of Fatboy.  Eric is the only one looking at this camera and smiling.  And you're not supposed to look at the camera and smile.  That was another picture.  But he's so excited to be taking the picture.  But it's not even close.  That was a dumb scene.  I love these photos.  The angle's wrong.  Let's see, they're all facing.  One's a close-up.  One's a faraway shot.  This one with a mirror.  Angle wrong.  The one doesn't have a mirror.  That's another one with a bad angle. 
[02:38:00]  You're terrible.  Wrong again.  Random.  So you just asked random people to take these pictures?  Yeah.  Hi, we're going to stand here.  Can you ruin this picture?  And they said yes.  Eric, if you had the screen cap, why wouldn't you tell the camera guy to move a little more behind you?  We did.  They got annoyed after the second shot.  So find someone else.  Or why wouldn't you fucking wear the same clothing as Sloan?  Sloan.  I would love to see Roland dressed up in Sloan's clothes.  Oh, I do.  Who was Sloan for the photo shoot?  Sam?  Were you Sloan?  I don't know.  Who was Sloan, Yurok?  Eric was Sloan in this one. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  Eric was.  It's all different.  Oh, Yurok wanted to be the lead.  Oh, Eric was Sloan in the other one, too.  You wanted to play Sloan, Yurok?  Aw.  He was the closest to having titties.  Aw.  Aw, man.  He's titties because he's fat.  God damn it.  Oh, big fat man.  See, that's not called for.  Aw.  Somebody wants to be Ferris.  Aw.  He wants to have a cool day off from school.  Ugh.  All kinds of fun adventures.  You think that's what this was?  It was a cool day off from work?  Yes.  He just wants to be Ferris Bueller and have, like, that amazing day off and get away with it. 
[02:39:00]  He just wants to get away with it.  Can we please play Steve's day off to go to break?  Oh.  That was a good one.  Wait.  That.  Oh, wait.  You almost got one right.  Who took that one?  You almost got one right.  You got Roland in front of the famous painting.  Yeah, the Roland one looks good.  Mm-hmm.  He's not paying attention.  Eric took that one.  You distracted, Yurok?  Loading something.  Why?  This is your segment.  Food into your face.  You're looking at photos.  Yeah, he actually was like, go over it.  Go look at the painting. 
[02:39:30]  Look at it.  And I was like, why?  I don't care.  I want to go.  But he gets the angle like that.  Let me ask you a question.  Are these all the pictures that you took at the art museum?  Yes.  Yeah.  We're out of there.  I told you, Danny.  This is what I was telling you.  We didn't look at anything except Ferris Bueller things.  He just wanted Ferris Bueller stuff.  I was getting yelled at for taking pictures of things that I guess you're not allowed to take pictures of.  Really?  Like what?  They don't like you taking pictures.  Well, there was an exhibit there and some of the stuff that was there was from private collectors.  And they just don't want pictures taken of their possessions. 
[02:40:00]  Wait, what do you mean?  You can't take pictures of some of the paintings?  And leave it in your house.  Yeah.  There was a Lichtenstein exhibit and most of it was open to the public.  You could look at it and take pictures of it.  But some of them, they would politely ask you for no photography.  And if they saw you trying to get a photo, they would just politely ask you if you could not do that.  Now, was it because of the private collectors or because of the flashing there were?  No, no, no flash.  There was no flash photography going on whatsoever.  It was just at the request of the owner, they requested that there be no photography.  That annoys me.  Like, for what? 
[02:40:30]  Why do you do it?  I only want my eyes to see it.  You shithead.  In all honesty, it's part of the art scene.  They could be concerned about, I mean, look, it's so easy to replicate and make fakes these days.  Like, with a real nice of the kind of cameras that they have now, one nice high quality shot could be enough to, you know, to put that image on a host of things.  Well, I got a friend.  I'm going to invite him down here to see if this is authentic.  If it is, it could be worth a lot of money.  Not sure if Lichtenstein ever made any mugs, though.  I'm not sure if he was ever affiliated with Cafe Press. 
[02:41:00]  You think it could also be, like, private collectors don't necessarily want people to know, like, where that artwork is?  Yeah, so put it in a gallery.  No, no, no, but I'm saying, like, if something is sold at auction to a private collector, and, oh, well, now it's being photographed here at this Chicago museum.  Okay, well, now I can backtrack and figure out who has this, you know, who might have this on loan.  No, because you can always find out where it's been.  It's in the Chicago museum.  That's what I'm saying, though, the people that don't want the photography taken. 
[02:41:30]  Right, so everybody knows it's in the Chicago museum.  They can still backtrack and find out where...  I'm just trying to come up with any logical explanation that people would not want these photos.  How about a logical one?  I wasn't allowed to take a photo of that.  Why?  And you can see, like, the image that they're using here.  It's all grainy, and you can tell it's not a very good quality photo.  Well, that does look like something you can replicate pretty easily.  It's a pretty cool painting.  Yeah, I was told to please put my camera away.  Oh, man.  Did you say why?  I did.  I said, oh, I'm sorry.  I was like, I thought you were allowed to take pictures.  And they were like, oh, you are.  And she was like, you know, out of, like, the 110 paintings that are here, there's, like, 
[02:42:00]  10 that the owners have requested, you know, no photography.  So I was like, no, I'm not going to request it.  And we said no.  I heard your request, and I fucking answered it.  No.  Yeah, what are they going to do?  It was cool.  I mean, there was so much other stuff to take pictures of.  How much do you think that's worth?  The hand on the spray.  $49.99.  No, no, it's more than that.  Wait, who did that paint?  It's a picture of it.  It's a yellow background, and it's a cartoony-looking hand spraying something.  It's Lichtenstein. 
[02:42:30]  Is that Lichtenstein?  Now, Lichtenstein's famous for what?  Wait, that's famous?  For that type of pop art.  That's famous?  Yeah, the pop art.  Yeah, him and, like, Warhol.  I don't think I've ever seen that before.  Is he alive or dead, Lichtenstein?  Early 60s.  Why is that famous?  What is it, Paul, right?  He's got more famous imagery.  Maybe the colors?  Maybe not that particular image, but, I mean, you've probably seen some of his stuff.  He seems to like yellows a lot.  Is this him?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I've seen some of his stuff.  It's like the comic book.  Yeah, that was his bag.  With the yellow hair.  Roland, did you like Chicago? 
[02:43:00]  I did.  It was fun.  What did you like about it?  The people.  The food.  The rom-com boat tour.  Oh, yeah, we took the rom-com boat tour.  That's what Roland called it.  Yeah, from, like, the breakup.  And we also felt like the Chicago skyline looked like Hong Kong, so we also feel like we now  visited Hong Kong.  Hong Kong.  Did you like the breakup?  Yeah, I loved it.  I never saw that.  Wait, who's in that?  Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston.  Nah, never saw that.  And what?  We were on the boat they used for the movie, so they say. 
[02:43:30]  But I'm sure every boat says that.  Of course.  See, like, I didn't mind the tour, for instance, because the tour was actually at least interesting.  Yeah.  But what I minded was Roland only wanting to go because a stupid movie character also  had a boat tour.  It's not even, doesn't mean anything.  It means nothing.  Yeah, he's right, though.  Oh.  Roland was so excited.  Roland just wanted to go on the Vince Vaughn boat tour.  He called it the rom-com boat tour.  I cut in line just to get a good seat.  Yeah, everyone was pissed because we cut in line and got the prime seats in the back. 
[02:44:00]  That was a fun tour.  We weren't going to wait in line.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Roland doesn't give a fuck.  No.  Roland gets on the boat first, and then literally 100 people are trying to take the seats next  to him.  He's the best seat saver I've ever seen.  I give in after a while.  I can't do it.  You have to.  I can say no maybe two or three times.  No, twice.  Yeah, one with the kids.  I'm like, hey, this isn't enough for you.  He was saving six seats.  Yeah, he's crazy.  It doesn't matter how many seats, he could save them.  On a crowded boat.  How'd you save him?  What were you saying? 
[02:44:30]  I said, those are taken.  Don't sit there.  Move on.  He was saving.  He does, too.  He goes, move along.  Move along.  Oh, he's so obnoxious.  There was two rows on the right side of the boat.  He was saving.  They were the best seats.  Everyone wanted them.  And for some, I don't know how he does it.  Not one person sat at him.  He kept saying that he was saving the seats for his retarded uncle.  Oh.  And then when Eric came on the boat, he said, there he is.  There he is.  I missed that idea of that.  He saved like fucking six seats in dead center for Prometheus. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  We went to go see that.  And I saw people going like, oh, there's some seats.  And they start coming in.  He goes, nope.  Nope.  They're taken.  Move along.  And he waves them away.  He's very dismissive.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  But then not only does he save seats for friends in a sold-out movie, he then saves seats for  himself because he doesn't want anyone sitting next to him.  Sitting next to him.  I saw people have to go in the front row because he wouldn't give up his seats.  And then do you ever notice people also turn around and start looking at the seats after  it's been a while? 
[02:45:30]  And they look and he'll say something like, no reason to look here.  Turn around.  Turn around.  It's like, oh, you fuck.  Or he'll say, they're getting popcorn.  Yeah, yeah.  Not a bathroom.  E-Rock.  We've talked about this before, about Captain America screening.  Yeah.  We're waiting and Roland's holding four seats from where he is to the end of the aisle.  And he's telling people, you can't, you can't.  People are standing in the back against the wall because there's no seats.  The lights go down and the movie starts and Roland just starts howling, laughing because  all these people have to stand.  And he has all these empty seats.  It's hilarious. 
[02:46:00]  But how do you, like, why don't you want anybody within four seats of you?  Why not?  It's fun.  They yap and they fucking move around.  They get elbows hitting your soda.  Fuck them.  It's not nice and comfy.  Yeah.  So that's what you liked about Chicago was the people were nice, the food, and the  rom-com boat tour.  And the jambalaya.  Roland didn't exactly taste Chicago.  He thought he was tasting Chicago.  What is jambalaya?  First of all, we went, he wanted to go to the famous hot dog place. 
[02:46:30]  But he drank a bunch of vodka at Jim's comedy show.  So he went back to his room and started puking and it couldn't go to the hot dog place.  Oh, did you get sick that night?  I drank like half a bottle of Greg.  Yeah.  Wow.  He had huge wine glasses full of just vodka and lime and bringing it back and forth between  the show.  Ow.  At the gig, before the show started, they asked us, do you want anything to eat?  Like, we'll get you some food.  And Roland looked at the menu and he ordered jambalaya, chili, and buffalo wings. 
[02:47:00]  Ooh, how that feels coming back up.  And then he said he only did it because he was sampling Chicago.  Which isn't the cuisine of Chicago whatsoever.  No, you got a little fucking Louisiana in there and some buffalo.  It was delicious chili.  I just had a little bit of everything.  And some fucking Mexico.  Yeah, it was delicious.  You like the sky deck?  I love the sky deck.  That was fun.  Jimmy went sky deck.  You did it at night, right?  Yeah, I've done it during the day.  I wish, and the woman, by the way, who showed us around was so nice. 
[02:47:30]  One of the managers took us on a tour, and the views of Chicago are fucking awesome.  It's ridiculous.  And they had that glass thing that you walk out into, which during the day is scarier.  But the views at night are really beautiful.  It's an awesome thing to do if you're in Chicago.  You can see, like, a little more, and it's scarier that way.  It's at the Willis Tower.  But I love the Chicago people.  I hate when you call it the Willis Tower.  They will not call it the Willis Tower.  We don't know that.  They said Sears Tower.  Yeah, the guy's like, we don't acknowledge that it's called Willis Tower.  Sam was very frightened of it. 
[02:48:00]  He was.  Yeah, he was holding on to the side of the building.  I tell you, that's how you act like you're from Chicago.  You say, I'm going to go check out the Willis Tower in Chi-Town.  I bet that works great.  Who was the main guy over there?  He was great.  Randy?  Randy was awesome.  His Twitter is SkyDeckChicago, I believe.  I think so, yeah.  Show him some love, I guess.  Even he was like, can you do the handstand?  What?  Kenny, we did a handstand in the little box.  The what?  The headstand or handstand? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, Kenny did.  You didn't see the headstand video?  I did.  It's just the way Roland says.  Oh.  Just.  It was hilarious because Kenny panicked for the first time since I've known him.  Oh, poor Kenny.  He started going, get me down.  How do you not be able to get down from a headstand?  Yeah, what was going on with that, Kenny?  You just tip over and you're down.  I think he was panicking that he could fall through the glass backwards or something.  Really?  What was going on in your mind?  I don't know.  I'm not a good gymnast.  Gymnast.  You told me all the blood was rushing to your head quickly. 
[02:49:00]  Well, I haven't.  All right, Kenny's attempting the, uh, Jesus is shoving him against him.  Get me down.  Get me down.  Get you down.  I think Chris just pushes him and he falls on his big dumb knees.  What happened?  I'm not good on my head.  I'm barely good on my feet.  How am I going to be good on my head?  Oh, man. 
[02:49:30]  The dark building with two antennas, that's the Hancock building.  Okay.  The other building on the right, that's the Trump Hotel.  Okay.  And then the water is Lake Michigan.  Fucking hilarious.  But he was on his head for maybe two seconds.  Yeah, not even.  Not even.  You just panicked, Kenny?  Well, I haven't done a headstand since I'm five years old, so.  Oh.  And then, like, when I went to do it and you put your head down, my head started hurting. 
[02:50:00]  And then, like, I was afraid to kick my thing up, so the guy helped me up.  And then, like, the minute I got up there, my shirt fell down, so my fat stomach was showing.  Why didn't you just come down off your...  I was stuck.  I don't know.  Well, because you feel like you might break your neck.  Yeah?  Yeah.  When you do it on a head...  Yeah.  Like a headstand.  And then you're scared that you might crash through this glass. 
[02:50:30]  That would be amazing.  They say it's, you know...  They say there's nothing that could go wrong, but, you know, your mind doesn't believe that shit.  Yeah, I wanted to do it delicately.  Yeah.  Doesn't it just feel like you're kind of in one of those outside elevators?  Nah, but looking down...  Yeah.  The fact that you have nothing around you...  And the glass is pristine.  Yeah.  So, I mean, there's no real glare.  There's no scratches.  It's fucked up.  Yeah, they clean it often.  Yeah, how do they get the outside clean? 
[02:51:00]  The whole thing comes in.  Yeah, it retracts.  Randy told us the whole story.  Oh, it does.  So they could clean underneath.  Oh, that makes sense.  So it is like...  It says...  It's like the glass you're looking through right there.  Gotcha.  It comes in on a track, so basically there's a few feet...  What happens is it sucks in, so then you just have like a few feet between where the window is  and the open space where the window is going to go, and they push it back out.  So then they kind of go in between there.  But you said they're a few feet away, but it is open outside. 
[02:51:30]  Imagine if you were fucking stuck to the front of that and being pushed out.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  It's fun just watching people trying to get the nerve up just to walk out on it.  Yeah, it takes a while.  And you're only, what?  It's only four and a half feet.  Four and a half feet.  Jimmy did push-ups on it.  Was that kind of weird?  I did two push-ups and I just was like, this is as many as I can do physically.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  It's all right. 
[02:52:00]  Can I see?  Danny, is there any footage of people cleaning it?  Every tall building should have this.  It's really fucking cool.  I thought how great it would be if they had like a crack sound they could play.  Oh, man.  Just to watch.  It's going to be a funny prank just to watch people run out.  Yeah.  I was trying it.  Like when people would get on, I would yell, crack!  But no one fell for it.  No.  Our tour boat guy, he thinks it's kind of cheesy.  It's not, though.  And he's like, you know, what you really should do is go to the top of the Hancock building, 
[02:52:30]  get a drink up there.  It's free, meaning you go to the bar, you're spending money on your drinks, and you still  get the nice views of Chicago with all that.  He goes, without all that nonsense.  But it's not nonsense.  I guess he's not a fan of the Skydex.  He's one of these fucking too hip for the room guys.  Sounds it.  Yeah, I like it the way it used to be.  He's old school?  Yeah, but it's like, I understand.  That's a really cool thing to step out and look down.  That's a great thing they did.  What about the window of Farris Bueller leaned against?  Oh.  Why didn't fucking E-Rock do that? 
[02:53:00]  Did you get a picture of at least the street that was on?  Wrong window, wrong lane?  Yeah.  We did.  The boat tour went by the Farris Bueller building where his father worked.  But what about the one where he leaned against the building?  I don't know.  Where was that?  That was the Sears Tower, I believe.  It was?  I do think so.  Oh, it was.  I think so.  The Skydex wasn't there.  No.  Well, they only had the Skydex on one side.  Out of the four.  And they said Christian Bale stood on the top for the actual...  Jesus.  I want to see a picture of that, too, on the Batman.  You know, I thought Randy... 
[02:53:30]  Batman.  I thought Randy was really cool, but if he was the shit, he would have fucking brought  us to the roof.  You know they bring people to the roof.  We went up to the roof.  You went to the roof?  No.  I just wanted to...  Oh, yeah.  But G.H., in all fairness, we didn't ask.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, you know what?  You're right.  You're fucking right.  And for insurance...  Say, I want to go stand out there and do the Batman part.  But I think they said that was, like, on the 90th floor, because there's different  ledges on the building.  Oh, right.  How high were we? 
[02:54:00]  103?  103.  Wow.  Hmm.  Oh, 90s are pussies.  I'll do that.  I'm looking through that glass all the way down to the river.  Holy fuck.  Next time, maybe we could broadcast here.  They have an event space on the 99th floor.  See, that would be cool, but I don't think you'd get the stop-in that you get where we were.  It would be cool for the first 15 minutes.  Yeah, then...  Now what?  Okay, great.  We're high up.  We're up high, and now we've got to, like, mix shit up.  Yeah, who are we?  Here in the Willis Tower in Chi-Town.  Chi-Town.  That's so douchey. 
[02:54:30]  You don't think Chicago people are like, I'm headed to Chi-Town.  I don't think so.  Great.  Chicago, huh?  That was good.  Good trip.  It took the shit out of us, but...  That was the coolest city that I've been to in quite some time.  That was a good one.  Definitely.  You've never been there either?  No.  So many people I know, they just have never been there.  Yeah, it was really cool.  Like these other cities.  Totally.  That's what I mean by it's kind of out of the way.  I kind of expected, like, Cleveland Part 2. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, and it was nothing close to Cleveland.  You know who's never been there?  Troy.  He'll probably go next time, right, guys?  Oh, sure.  And it was a perfect broadcast without him.  I'm essential to the broadcast effort.  Oh, boy.  Apparently not.  He will not be invited on the next day.  Where should we do the next one?  We should do another one.  Austin.  Yeah.  Austin.  Austin.  I'd say...  Austin's on my short list.  I'd say Toronto first, and then Austin for weather. 
[02:55:30]  Austin.  Toronto.  If we don't go to Toronto in the next couple months, no fucking way.  We should go, though.  I think that Canada...  We could turn around a Toronto trip?  Yeah, easily.  Again, we just will not be doing it when I have a gig, but we go another time.  We have to resign first.  Yes, that's true.  And then we should fucking, like, do a Toronto trip.  Resign?  Well, that could happen, too.  Obviously.  We'll figure it out.  I want to go to Austin.  I want to go to cities I've never been to.  That's pretty wild.  It's kind of selfish, but fuck it. 
[02:56:00]  Is that...  Nah.  That didn't happen at the same time, right?  I think it did.  Bunch of bolts of lightning hitting a...  Let me see.  Hang on.  It's part of a still...  It's a still from a video, but apparently lightning struck both those buildings at the exact same time.  The Hancock and the fucking...  Trump.  Is that Trump?  Yeah.  Cool.  That's crazy.  It has to be.  Trump's close to Hancock.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I guess that's the view from the Willis or close.  Wow. 
[02:56:30]  Isn't that the view that we had just seen, Ken?  Yeah.  Maybe an extreme close-up?  No, it can't be, Kenny, because when you point out in the dumb video, Trump was on the right.  It could be a reverse image.  It could be the angle.  Of the dangle.  Did I tell you?  No, this is from the water.  She rode in the elevator with the Trump daughter.  Oh, yeah?  Which one?  Oh, really?  Ivanka?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Was she with security?  No.  She was just talking to another couple.  How'd she look?  How'd she smell?  Yeah, and they got off at the spa floor. 
[02:57:00]  Someone's rubbing her down.  Damn.  She's hot, man.  The people at that hotel were extremely nice and extremely good-looking.  Yeah, money.  Chicago's in a very attractive city.  There's a lot of attractive people walking around.  It is an attractive city, right?  Yeah, man.  Aesthetically, Chicago is fantastic.  You're right.  I can't rave enough.  It's one of my favorite places.  Yeah, I got to agree.  San Francisco we should do one time, too.  Yeah, San Francisco's great, too.  I like that a lot.  Well, the listeners got to figure it out for us.  Where do we go next? 
[02:57:30]  We should just retire and travel.  That'd be good.  We've never been to Atlanta as a show.  Atlanta, we have not.  Atlanta would be nice.  Have a contest on your Facebook page.  I would be interested to hear where people want us to go.  I vote Canada, and I think we should do Montreal.  If we're still here next July for the festival, we should book it in advance, and we should  do a couple of days.  I could drive if the company wants it.  They could pay for the gas.  I'd be happy to do that.  Or I promise not to eat anything that's not fast food. 
[02:58:00]  I did a Facebook poll before we did Chicago, and you'd be surprised at some of the results.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What do you think?  Lots of Rochester.  Slash Buffalo.  Oof.  That's Toronto.  We would do Toronto if we could do Buffalo or Rochester.  Lots of Denver.  Denver.  I've never been to Denver.  Huh?  Aurora?  No, Denver.  Not Aurora.  Jesus.  Jesus, Kenny.  Fucking Kenny. 
[02:58:30]  Adam Ferrara is here.  We're going to take a quick break.  Oh, yes.  And the other guys.  Get us to 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  From Top Gear here.  Top Gear guys.  I've never seen Top Gear.  I'm not sure if the other ones are here.  I just don't know.  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  So false advertising.  I see one of the other guys, right?  I don't know.  That might be Adam.  He's here with some people.  No, I see Adam.  But then I think I see Adam.  Seattle.  I'm going to walk up to Adam.  Let's go to Seattle.  People like this.  Jesus, Kenny.  I'd go to Seattle.  You and I would have a lot of fun in Seattle.  Oh, what is that?  Sexual stuff.  Sexual stuff.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Guys would mow out or something under the needle. 
[02:59:00]  Imagine if that was your pecker.  I wish it was your pecker.  I went to Seattle.  Seattle rules.  See, I've never been to Seattle, and there's a lot of stuff I'd like to see there.  Seattle's a great city.  Yeah.  There's a lot of...  All right.  Adam Farrar next.  Who said life was all about following the rules?  Carleese.  Carleese.  I'm a man of leisure.  This summer.  Craig Hughes, it's Mr. Carleese.  You're an asshole.  Find out what happens when one executive producer discovers he has 50 sick days and decides to 
[02:59:30]  use them all.  Ah, the Prius.  If you have the means, I highly recommend you pick one up.  Starring Steve Carleese.  I want to eat in that restaurant.  I'm going to make a fake reservation with my new stomach.  And Steve Carleese as Steve Carleese.  Don't you know me?  I'm Abe Froman, the internet king of Jersey.  Look at the Foundry logos on everything.  We're shaking a baby now. 
[03:00:00]  Twist and Shout coming every Monday.  A family member has days off and you give them crap?  You're an asshole.  Steve Carleese's day off.  Life goes by pretty fast.  If you don't take vacation time, you'll miss out on it.  As you know, there's a lot of websites.  We've all been to them.  Who hasn't been to a dating site?  I have because I'm lonely and I strike out horribly on dating sites. 
[03:00:30]  There's only a handful of online dating sites where you can actually meet women who just want to bang.  They don't want to talk.  They just want to feel your competent penis inside of their starved vaginas.  The top of that list, cougarlife.com.  Over 2 million women.  Cougar Life has kind of cornered the market in single moms who are stuck at home and recent divorcees who are desperate for some dick.  There's nothing better than a woman who is desperate for dick. 
[03:01:00]  Because that means she'll do anything for dick.  And more importantly, it means even your average cock will do.  According to a recent study, women in their 40s are five times more likely to bang you on the first date than women in their 20s.  By the way, that means that they're 10 times more likely than women in their 80s.  Oh, I fucked that up.  I was going to say women in their 80s are 10 times more likely.  I fucked up.  I need a woman who's desperate for dick.  That's the only way I'm going to get laid. 
[03:01:30]  Think of all the single moms or recent divorcees out there who haven't had a date in years.  Because they've been married.  They've been with these zeros for a long time.  They're raising their shitty kids.  Now, you don't have to like their kids.  You can just pretend to like them.  Like, you know, you ruffle the kid's hair.  Oh, I'm going to take your mother out and fuck her in the car.  She'll be back in 10 minutes.  And where do these women go to fucking frolic?  They can't just sit out in the park with their pussies hanging out because they have their kids.  So they go to cougarlife.com because they're sneaky.  So instead of wasting your time being teased by some uptight brat at the bar, go to Cougar Life and see if you can break the record of banging 30 cougars in 30 days. 
[03:02:00]  Try Cougar Life for free today.  You have nothing to lose if you try it for free, obviously.  See why it was voted the wildest dating service in America three years in a row.  How much better would that have been?  According to a recent study, women in their 40s are five times more likely to fuck you on the first date.  And women in their 80s are 10 times more likely.  But I fucked it up and I said, they're five times more likely than women in their 80s.  Women in their 80s don't fuck because they're just too ill. 
[03:02:30]  They would fuck you, but their bones hurt when they're being sodomized by an orderly.  There really is a fine line between a cougar and a cadaver.  But if you want to fuck a woman in her 40s who has not been getting dick properly, go to CougarLife.com.  I just kind of fucked up a lot too, but you know, you know what I'm talking about.  SiriusXM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:03:00]  Adam Froar in studio.  Oh my God.  How are you fellas?  And the other guy from Tom Kier.  I brought my pal Rutledge Wood with me.  Hi Rutledge.  The other guy.  I'm just joking with you, sir.  We're just meeting you for the first time.  I'm just thinking, man, I should not have called and told my parents to turn the show on.  I should have just waited until the live read was done.  But I also told him, you guys, Jim Norton's here.  He's one of my favorites.  You're going to love it.  Oh, thank you. 
[03:03:30]  I don't know if that's changed slightly.  I bet your grandma tweets him now.  Where's that orderly?  He's quite a professional.  He just reads the copy verbatim like that.  That's right.  For the record, Jim's amazing.  He brought that live read to life.  That took me on a journey.  Suddenly, I'm thinking, 80's not that bad.  Maybe 80's the new 40.  You'll see me great if you go home and you check your dad's history and you see that he's been on CougarLife.com.  Maybe this inspires.  There you go.  Inspires.  That's it.  Come here.  Tell me about Truman while I whisper in your good ear. 
[03:04:00]  The show's, what, tomorrow's the premiere?  Tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night, Tuesday night, 9 o'clock on History.  Top Gear.  And we do police cars.  Yeah, what is this now?  You get to...  Well, you know, the Crown Vic's going away.  Yeah.  We've been phasing that out for a while.  We gave it a royal send-off.  Yeah.  Because nothing's better than giving three idiots Crown Vic's with lights on them and then an open parking lot.  And letting us go.  What are they doing with it now, though?  Why is the Crown Victoria leaving and what are they putting in its place?  Well, that's the thing. 
[03:04:30]  We're trying to figure it out.  Ford has made a police car.  They made the Taurus, the twin turbo Taurus.  I drove it.  My father had a Taurus years ago and I was driving home from a masturbation booth and I spun it out on the ice and I had to call my girlfriend Liz to come pick me up in her car.  So I was too scared to drive.  Oh, you're terrible.  It's the truth.  And the Taurus, okay, so what else?  The Taurus Dodge made a Charger with a Hemi in it and used a Chevy.  I was in the new Chevy Caprice, which is really like the Pontiac G8, but stretched.  Yeah. 
[03:05:00]  And it's a police-only car right now.  Chevy will bring it out next year as the SS and then run it in NASCAR.  But Adam pointed out it's the first time he's ever been in the front seat of a cop car.  Oh, you bad boy.  It's lovely.  Yeah.  When Joey Cola bailed me out, you remember that story?  Oh, I am.  When Joey Cola bailed me out of jail?  Why'd you get arrested?  I got a speeding ticket.  I paid a speeding ticket and I moved.  So I moved my bank when I moved, when I was living down in Huntington.  I moved and I took the check bounds because I took the, I changed banks. 
[03:05:30]  So there was a warrant out for a year, but they don't tell you.  I get pulled over for a busted headlight with Joey Cola in the car coming home from a gig and there's a warrant for your arrest.  So Joey, as we're pulling up, Joey goes, listen, my brother's a cop.  I'll talk to these guys.  I know how to talk to them.  I'll take care of everything.  Don't worry, you're with me.  Step out of the car.  There's a warrant for your arrest.  Hey, I don't even know this guy.  I got kids.  We're just doing a gig together.  That's all we are.  So they put me in a, we straightened it out and Joey had to bail me out. 
[03:06:00]  But he had to drive, remember my Thunderbird?  Yeah.  He had to drive a Thunderbird and he couldn't drive a shift.  So not only do I'm handcuffed in the back of the car, don't know why I'm arrested, but I smell my clutch and I see the headlights bobbing up and down.  He stayed in first gear the whole fucking time.  Is that bad?  Yeah, that's bad.  That's not good.  I don't drive a stick either.  Didn't you get arrested once with some, that girl years ago?  What the hell?  Oh, the drunk driving girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We left the lawnmowers from hell gig.  We did a gig at the, where we used to bet the Preakness next to the, uh, some gin mill next to an OTB. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, we used to go and bet the horses and then we did a gig over there.  Yeah.  And I left with the bartender and she was driving and she was shit friends.  She got the deewey.  Yeah.  Right.  And the cop goes, you're like, come pick me up.  Yeah, you got to drive the car home, son.  And I go, hey, I'm drunk too.  I'm not driving this car.  That's entrapment.  I watch Law & Order.  You're not fucking getting me, copper.  And he went, no, it's okay.  You're with me.  So I can be drunk as long as I'm with the cop.  Yeah, yeah, you were fine.  What the, I remember though, you were very annoyed because I think it was a pretty done deal. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Yeah.  Swing and a miss.  Yeah.  It's not like it's not as easy.  Once the cop holes are away.  It's not as easy as cougar life.  I'll tell you what.  Nothing fucks up a good blowjob like an arrest.  Yes.  A drunk driving arrest.  $10,000 in lawyers and losing your license for a year just ruins every vibe.  I didn't get laid.  I got a misdemeanor.  Yeah, that was bad.  You want to pick him up?  And then I came back to the apartment.  Nah, I wasn't going anywhere.  I was probably drunk too. 
[03:07:30]  Well, who picked you up?  I think I spent the night.  I spent the night.  Yeah, you were in the police station.  I was playing cards with the cops.  Yeah, you were in the station waiting for her to get out.  Yeah.  Boy, you were trying, weren't you?  No, I had nowhere to go.  You fuckers weren't answering the phone.  I'm not going to call my father.  Hi.  I didn't, I'm not, I'm not arrested, but I'm at the police station.  Come get me in the middle of the night.  So I played, I played cards with the cops.  How about a taxi?  At that point in time.  Nah, I didn't afford anything.  Nah, I was sitting in the police station with a backwards police hat on and an ice cream cone. 
[03:08:00]  Thank you for finding me in the mall, officer.  I still know what you were doing.  You're still holding out hope that you were going to fucking get laid.  You know what?  We were young and foolish then.  Just let her out of the cell, please.  Or was it just a nice...  Conjugal visit and lock up.  Or was he just being a nice guy?  Yeah, it was it.  Adam has that in him.  He is a nice guy.  Adam is a nice guy.  That's true.  I'll vouch.  He almost got arrested on Top Gear when I flipped a truck violently three and a half 
[03:08:30]  times into over end.  Adam didn't know you're not totally supposed to run across an open racetrack to check on  your friend who he thought was dead.  And this guy's like, hey, you're going to get arrested.  And Adam, I don't know what obscenity.  It's hard with his accent sometimes to hear exactly what different version of the F word  he's shouting at somebody.  No, it wasn't.  It was syphilitic cocksucker.  That's what it was.  That's a good word.  That is a good word.  But that's why I was like, you know what?  That's a good guy right there.  What do you mean you can't run across a racetrack?  Oh, I ran in the back.  He flips this truck, right? 
[03:09:00]  So he goes end over.  I thought he was dead.  Right.  As did I for a minute.  Wow.  So it was bad.  So I go running back.  It was like driving your dad's Taurus.  Just like that.  I actually spun on the ice.  I was trying to tap the brake gingerly.  That's in the promo, though, for the show.  Yeah, yeah.  You wreck that truck.  When he goes end over.  Don't try that.  No.  It sucks.  It sucks bad.  Thank you.  So this is a dude my size is not supposed to really be in there.  It's like a micro machine, but they're getting at him.  They basically want to kill you.  I think the producers try to just come up with different ways to kill us. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  For sure.  How many seasons for you guys?  This is our third.  Third, yeah.  Nice.  And what channel is it on?  History.  Okay.  I hope you'll watch.  I have seen episodes, yeah.  I think my favorite thing we did this season, and it's something that's right up your alley,  we decided to get three rental cars and try to take them off-road from Monument Valley,  Arizona, to Moab.  Yeah.  And if you've ever heard people say, don't buy a rental car, we are why.  Yeah.  Watch this show.  Off-road.  And every guy that's ever just done anything terrible to a rental car will be like, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  It was like driving through a Roadrunner cartoon.  Yeah.  Waiting for fucking safes to fall on.  It was like Vanishing Point without all the math.  You know?  They do get beat the fuck up.  Who would buy a rental car?  Why would anybody do that?  Totally.  I never knew anyone that has.  Like, it's the dumbest thing.  Well, they go to the auctions.  When we bought that, when we did the, remember the Mustang 2, the shitty cars?  Yes.  We go to the auctions to sell them.  That's where they all wound up, at the fucking police auctions.  You got to use, I'm telling you, you got to car fax stuff, because if it's been a rental 
[03:10:30]  car.  It's just been beat on.  I took one to, I rented one in Colorado once.  It was one of those Chrysler 300s.  And it was snowing like a motherfucker.  And I was coming back from some bar, of course.  And I was in the parking lot of the hotel.  And the parking lot was empty.  Yeah.  So I just had a tear up doing donuts in the snow.  And I did it to the point where I just smelled every fluid was boiling.  Even the washer fluid.  Everything.  And I stopped.  I just heard grinding noises. 
[03:11:00]  So I go in.  I pass out.  I wake up the next morning and have to take it back to the rental place.  It started, but it just wouldn't go over five miles an hour.  It's in limp mode.  And it just smelled tranny burning and everything.  Oh, no.  I fucked it.  Oh, no.  Transmissions.  Transmission fluid.  And the power steering was gone.  Yeah.  I fucked that up.  It's limp mode.  It's just you can get it back to the dealer.  It was terrible.  Do you remember the Dodge Magnum?  It was a few years ago.  Dodge made this sort of wagon off the 300. 
[03:11:30]  Yes.  At least one for a couple weeks when I was out in L.A.  Yeah.  It was not a bad idea.  It was just a little bit awkward.  My friend Rambo.  I travel with NASCAR every week for the Speed Channel.  And we used to have this tech manager named Rambo.  We were driving back from Talladega towards Birmingham.  And he was on the interstate and said,  I wonder what happens when you throw a car in reverse at 80.  Oh, shit.  And just grenade the transmission.  What does happen when you do that?  He said it went click really loudly and then boom.  But it doesn't stop.  It kept forward momentum and completely ate the transmission. 
[03:12:00]  Of course.  That was it.  Pull it over to the side.  What the fuck?  Who would try that?  Well, people who wonder what happens, I guess.  And then he called the rental car company and was like,  this piece of shit's on the side of the road.  That's all you got to do.  Did you film it at least?  No.  That was just like a Tuesday.  That was just him.  What the fuck?  I initialed everything on the form, motherfucker.  Hey, when you get that full insurance.  That's it.  It's like a pass for anywhere you go, it's a demolition dirty.  Just license to fuck that thing up.  I've been in rental cars where I just wanted to see what it felt like to sideswipe a light pole in a parking lot. 
[03:12:30]  It doesn't matter.  Eh.  When you haven't.  Wasn't using that door.  I'm telling you.  My buddy Kyle Petty told me they were up at Nazareth Speedway one day.  And for some reason, someone had the door open on the van.  So all these NASCAR crew guys are in the van and they went over a set of railroad tracks with the door open.  I don't know why.  The sliding door falls off.  They return the car without the door.  How do you explain that one? 
[03:13:00]  They didn't say a word because they had the full insurance.  They were like, yeah.  I don't even have to explain it.  Damn door's gone.  What happened to the vehicle?  I brought it back.  Most of it.  It's okay.  Full tank of gas.  I didn't take the fuel option.  It's all filled up.  I parked a rental car on Beverly and some kid threw a rock, a big boulder through the windshield.  I mean through the back window.  I drove it back to the airport.  Guy goes, what happened?  I said, there's a rock.  He goes, did you take the insurance?  Yeah.  Okay, thanks.  The rock was still fucking sitting there. 
[03:13:30]  I didn't even take it out.  The guy just took it.  I drove back from, it was from my father's house to the airport when I was out in California  back in the 80s.  San Juan Capistrano.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was driving to the airport, late as a motherfucker, ain't got time to fucking deal with car rental  check-in things.  Just threw it in a parking space, park, and ran to the plane.  And I think it was like three months later, I got my father called up and said that someone  finally got in touch with him and said that I had stolen a car. 
[03:14:00]  So I'm like, no, I fucking returned it.  It's at the airport.  Looked for it.  It was in the wrong spot?  It wasn't even at the rental place.  He just left it.  I just left it.  At the airport.  Oh, I thought that was it.  Nah.  Okay.  Busy.  Busy.  I had a plane to catch.  I got shit to do.  Eventually, they'll find it.  That's what I thought.  Like, you know what?  They got GPS in this.  They got something.  There's a license for GPS back in the 80s, I wish.  It was, I figured they'd check the license plate, you know, they'd cruise by after a few weeks, 
[03:14:30]  they'd check the trunk for a body, realize it's a rented car.  That's the GPS saved my life because you remember how directional savvy I was.  Terrible.  You was?  Oh, you are the worst.  Oh, you are the worst.  This is the thing is, like, when we shoot threes, like, it's usually, if Tanner usually  goes first, the race car, because nobody wants to fucking drive behind him because he's  a pain in the ass, right?  Totally.  Totally.  Up your ass the whole time.  Oh, really?  You're always going too slow.  If I go first, we get lost.  Nobody wants to ride ahead of him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nobody wants to ride ahead of him. 
[03:15:00]  But we also don't want to follow him.  No, you don't want to follow me, though.  Because he drives very fast.  Well, you can't, like, we'll be on the side of an ice cliff, you know, tiptoeing around  something, and he's gone.  He drifted that thing.  What a lunatic.  He's out, and Adam and I are back there thinking about our wives.  Yeah, there's no fucking guardrail.  Yeah, this insurance is paid up.  This shit happens, you know.  We were in Colorado with minivans with tires too big on these trails that, you know,  like, fucking, when they find the Quinn Martin murders, when the guy goes off the cliff. 
[03:15:30]  It's always some old fucking, yeah, Ford.  Some old fucking Mercury goes off the cliff.  And that's all that's running through my mind.  Barnaby Jones is going to show up.  Cannon.  Yeah.  Mobile operator.  That stupid phone he had in the car in the old Lincoln.  I love that thing.  And Tanner's just bombing through this stuff, and we're just, like, tiptoeing around.  But it is fun to watch Adam get lost, especially in a city that's built on a grid.  That's just.  How does that happen?  That just never gets hold to me.  Because, you know, eventually, you'll come back. 
[03:16:00]  If you just keep going left or keep going right, we'll meet up again.  I don't know how many calls I would get from Adam going, where am I?  Like, what do you mean?  You're there.  I don't know where you are.  I don't know.  All right.  Did you pass, like, the wall bombs, the shopping center?  I don't know.  I might have.  Any type of help, Adam.  Any input you could give me.  I always had to meet.  We were at some gig somewhere, so we got to meet you at some gig, and you're always sitting. 
[03:16:30]  And then you're in your fucking Streisand mode, because you got to sing.  And the pain in the ass you are.  Then we got to hook up the lights.  Remember we got to hook up the lights?  He's got these giant Lilco gloves and these jumper cables to hook into the 220 line, coming off the fucking pole.  Ah, you know what sounded better than just a band?  A band with a lot of lights.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We used to put on a giant show.  And he would make shit that doesn't work.  So he's got 220 volts coming into an Atari board that I have to fucking run.  Now run this.  Yeah.  Don't electrocute yourself. 
[03:17:00]  Adam could never find anywhere.  Mm-mm.  And he could never even get home from where he was.  I could.  I'm lost.  I can get home.  I used to have to go to my uncle's house in Hicksville, because I knew how to get home from there.  Oh, right.  He'd have to go to somewhere where he knew how to get home.  Oh, how you got on a car show.  Well, on GPS, I'm fine now.  Yeah.  Apparently so.  Now, on GPS, I'm golden.  Yeah.  But it's cool, because we get to drink.  Never your strong suit.  We get to pick, and we get to buy these old cars is when we have the most fun, because 
[03:17:30]  you can buy, you know, we do whatever we want.  So I got an old 93 Elante, that old Gindaloon Cadillac.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do that?  It was so fitting in so many ways to see Adam in this gold-plated, you know, Elante.  The thing smelled like brute cologne.  I don't know when it started, but Adam rolls up, and he just gets out and says, ah?  Ah?  Ah?  Ah?  And now Tanner does it?  Oh, it's beautiful.  What did you do in the car?  Well, we had to go find cars that were forgotten in a certain decade, the cars we liked that 
[03:18:00]  didn't get the just, they're just desserts, so they're just the praise that they deserve,  so we all picked different cars.  All right, here's a question I have.  Why did the original Volkswagen, like Volkswagen van, there's a weird vibe to them.  Why did they go away?  The Volkswagen Micro?  The Micro Bus?  The original, or just the original Volkswagen, either the van and the car.  They're back.  The car's back.  It is back.  If I can dork out for just a second here, Jim, I'll tell you, they made the original  Beetle in Mexico up until, I believe, 2000.  The biggest thing here and other places was the safety standards, you know, missions as 
[03:18:30]  well.  I have a 66 Volkswagen double cab, so it looks like a VW bus, but the back has been cut out,  but not for me.  Why cut out?  Well, they did that.  It's like an El Camino bus.  It's like a big pickup.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I see, I see.  It's got two rows of seats.  It's pretty killer.  I had a Baja bug years ago.  I remember that.  They're great.  They were fun.  Just drive in the woods.  Vans were the stuff, though.  There's something cool about that when you see one.  You saw one on the closing ceremonies of the Olympics last night, didn't you?  I did not watch.  No, no, no, no.  I was having semen pulled out of me for money. 
[03:19:00]  But I did.  I did.  I was having my own Olympics.  Google Life.com.  The Volkswagen bus, we had one growing up.  Yeah, everybody.  We took the seats out to fit more kids in there.  Yeah.  Oh, they're great.  Yeah, that's a true story.  Just hold on to where the...  That's a good trick.  Yeah.  How much could you buy an original bus for, a Volkswagen bus, that's in good shape?  Like a decent one?  Well, a nice one, probably, I would say 15 grand. 
[03:19:30]  You can get one with a little work here and there for probably eight or nine.  You could spend more for the window one.  You need a showroom one.  We're talking like in the 40s.  But if it's...  But I mean, an original one?  I don't mean like a 21 window or a 23 window micro bus.  Those are the ones that sell at Barrett-Jackson for like 150 grand.  What's the 23, 21 window one?  21 window had the sliding rack top, had all these cool little windows on the roof on the  side.  And the 23 had them up by the driver and the passenger.  So those were really rare.  They're rare?  Yeah.  But a fish tank.  Do they have them in great condition still? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, they're out there.  They're just expensive.  Yeah, it was almost like a roof extension kind of thing.  The Samba is a Volkswagen website.  You should get on there.  Oh, I'm just...  I don't know why.  I passed one or I saw one.  I'm like...  My friend Dean had a Volkswagen bug.  And I think my other friend had...  He had a van, too.  I think he had a bus, too.  He used to smoke pot and get high.  It just brings back a lot of memories.  You know what's great about Volkswagens, too?  If you...  Unless you grenaded the engine, if you couldn't get it running, you didn't own a penis and  testicles as a man. 
[03:20:30]  Or a butter knife.  There was always a way to fucking get that thing going.  I had a friend that gave me one.  They gave me a bug, and I felt bad.  I got it running, too.  We got it running.  The next day, I was pushing...  Volkswagen gonorrhea.  Pushing my dad up and down the driveway to get it started.  And we got it started.  I spent a bunch of money changing stuff on the engine.  It never ran better than that first day that it started from jumping it.  But you know, Jim, you could get one of the old panel vans and make it like Jim's  mobile Jack Shack. 
[03:21:00]  I would like that, actually.  You could start a chain.  Oh, man.  I would love that.  Do you see a blow on the back of a VW?  You know how creepy you look driving a Volkswagen fan?  I have a friend who has a panel van, and their license plate, vanity plate, in Georgia  is Chester 1.  Oh, great.  Chester Molester.  What's a panel van?  What's technically a panel van?  No windows.  It's usually a crime scene.  Oh, yeah.  It has front windows and driver and passenger.  Did you help me with this couch chair?  Bring it all the way in.  Panel van would be great to get horses in.  Size 14?  No.  Why not?  No, because you're going to get police in there, too. 
[03:21:30]  Creepy old painter's van?  But police, they're not going to look in your van.  If this van's a rockin', I'm murdering a hooker.  It doesn't run, but it's accurate.  It is.  I'll get the year's supply of trash bag options.  Sitting there with Lawrence Bittaker fucking pulling the fingernails off a runaway.  Oh, man.  It was dark in there, dude.  It was dark.  It was a bit dark.  It was just...  You're winding around looking for the knobs.  Oh, get me out of here.  What was the Joey Chitwood stuff show shit you've done? 
[03:22:00]  Hey, guys, I got to go, so I'm going to stick it by.  I'm catching a plane.  I don't want to interrupt you with story.  Oh, don't chase it too far.  Oh, jeez.  Fucking call me a...  All right.  Jay Leno tomorrow night.  Jim Norton.  I got a little buddy.  Yes, Jay Leno.  I got a little tomorrow night.  I have a...  I love how uncomfortable you make him on that show.  So please turn it up.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be hopefully creepy tomorrow.  I think he loves it too.  Oh, he does.  In a creepy way, right?  He does.  Leno loves that.  He's a lot, I think, dirtier than people realize.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he likes to do that dance on the line of like... 
[03:22:30]  I always call them dad jokes to where your dad will tell it and he thinks it's funny  but no one else does.  Yeah.  He likes to take the dad joke just a little bit south.  Just ahead.  Not much.  He definitely has that evil side of him.  Yeah.  Just stick his toe in the water.  Yeah.  Did you talk about the tiny car?  Oh, yeah.  We were showing us pictures.  It's the smallest car in the world?  It's a Peel Trident.  Peel Trident.  It's the smallest two-seater in the world.  They have a smaller car called the Peel 50 but you can only get one person there.  We were over at Good Morning America and showed them and we drove that.  We took small cars out. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  We took cars into the swamps in New Orleans.  Well, explain how small this car is.  It's like a Pop-O-Matic on the Trouble game.  Remember Trouble?  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  That's the Pop-O-Matic.  That's such a good one.  Yeah.  Just that big...  Yeah.  That's it.  And it's got three wheels.  Reminds me of Boggle.  He drove it through Georgia.  Yeah, in my little town.  In 90 degree weather.  In Sonoya, Georgia weather.  They shoot The Walking Dead there if you've ever seen that show.  They shoot that in our downtown.  It's like the totally uncool Jetsons car.  It's just tiny little three wheeled things.  That's exactly what it looks like.  Can you really get two people in it? 
[03:23:30]  It looks tiny.  We did.  It's not comfortable.  Those type of cars are frightening when I see some of those really small cars on the road.  I'm like, who would want to be in traffic in that?  And they made it in London.  It was supposed to be this great idea to get around stuff.  Oh, great.  And it was basically seen as like a motorcycle because it was a 49cc little scooter, basically.  Two wheels up front, one wheel in the back, and then somebody, some genius...  A caster in the back.  Yeah, exactly.  Some genius changed this one to a 200cc Vespa engine. 
[03:24:00]  So it has four times the power, but no more stability.  It's as sketchy and scary as the first one was.  No grip from the wheels of a Jennifer convertible.  No.  I was going over a railroad track in our town, and the back wheel just dug in on one of the tracks going over,  and I just got stuck.  And I sat there, and the tires started spinning.  Oh, that's good.  That thing versus train.  There's no pride in dying in a car like that.  There's no cool ending to it, you know?  Yeah, that's fucking... 
[03:24:30]  We drove that.  The funny part, we ended up in Louisiana.  Like you were saying, Adam, of course, picked the Fiat 500.  I'm not saying because he's Italian, but it's because he's Italian.  Okay?  It was the only choice for him.  I was in a sign IQ.  Tanner was in a smart car, which is the first time you'll ever see something and think,  okay, the smart car's cooler than I thought.  Yeah, because he actually drifted a little bit.  Yeah, because he drove over a levee.  It was out of hand.  I saw a video of you, Mr. Ferrara, in, I think it was Governor's parking lot. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you were tearing up the...  That M5.  Yeah.  No, that was Steve White's car.  That's Steve White's M car.  That's Steve White's car, his M5.  He let you just smoke the tires up like that.  Yeah, he goes, come on, with Governor's, no one in the parking lot.  It was pretty goddamn impressive, the stop, too.  Thanks.  Because you swung right into position.  Anyone could just spin a car around a few times.  But when you slide it into position there and get out like, hey, here are the keys.  That was pretty goddamn impressive.  Thank you.  That was fun.  When somebody offers you an M5 to just beat up on, you have to take it. 
[03:25:30]  Sure.  Yeah, because at first you're watching, wow, this is really cool.  And it's like, who would allow them to do that in their car?  It's crazy, especially Adam.  Yeah.  But yeah, no, that's fun.  That car was fun.  The other car that was really fun was the Mustang, I told you.  I sent you pictures.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got those.  Yep.  Yeah, really cool.  Because we did that muscle car one we did.  I had the Mustang, you had the Challenger, and Tanner had the Camaro.  And out of three of them, I liked the Mustang.  Yeah.  Challenge was fun, but it's a big girl. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, yeah?  She's a big girl.  But it's the best remake of, if you look at the retro muscle cars, it's the most period  correct.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.  The Camaro, you just can't see a damn thing out of it.  You can't see anything out of it.  No, that little windshield is...  Yeah, you're low riding against your will.  It's all chopped.  Yeah, yeah.  And backing up, it just needs a sound that says, like, good luck, you guys.  Good luck, everybody.  You can't see a damn thing.  You can't see the ends of the car.  You can hear them, but you can't see them.  That was fun.  And we got to race in the L.A. River, like where they shot Grease. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  And we're in these original muscle cars of the versions we had.  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot about that.  And I'm in this cute little girl had this 70 Challenger with a 440.  She rebuilt it in her second story apartment in Hollywood.  Now, this engine alone's got to weigh 500 pounds.  And somehow, she got a cherry picker and drug that thing up the stairs at her apartment.  Rebuilt it in her living room.  How did she, why would you rebuild it on a second floor? 
[03:27:00]  Great question.  I asked the same thing.  She didn't have a good answer for it, but she's at the end of this thing.  That's where the tools were.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  So they lined, Tanner up was closest to the wall.  Then there's me and this monster Challenger.  Then they put Adam in this badass boss with a bad clutch right next to the drop-off into  the river.  Yeah.  And my first thing.  With a straight axle.  My first thing was like, you guys have seen the show, right?  Adam's called the wrecker.  Yeah.  And some poor bastard just loaned us his car and they stuck Adam basically in the river 
[03:27:30]  to try this.  So I got to hold on.  I got to hold the line.  And the second gear, I hit with the straight.  Too much gas.  It's getting sideways on you.  Yep.  You're done.  That was a fun time.  And there's a naked man washing himself.  Oh, that was amazing.  There's someone.  This giant homeless man and pissed that we were there.  Get out of my bathroom.  But 100, 200 yards up from him around the turn is another homeless guy taking a deuce in  the same river.  Oh, man.  So there's a baby roof floating down towards the guy taking a bath. 
[03:28:00]  And then three idiots just flying by in cars.  Yeah.  I must have shocked the shit out of him.  Time of my life.  It's a lot of fun, man.  What the fuck is this neighborhood coming to?  I'm watching you guys tooling around in this.  Top Gear premieres tomorrow.  Tomorrow night.  9 p.m.  History Channel.  Yeah.  I like History Channel.  There's a lot of fun stuff on that.  It's amazing.  And the premiere episode, of course, finding the best and fastest new cop car, I guess.  New cop car, yeah.  That's very cool.  It's a good time.  Guys.  Good to see you again, pal.  Always good to see you there, pal. 
[03:28:30]  And, yeah, I mean, it's a great show.  I like it.  Come out and bring the car.  I want to, yes.  Bring the car.  Bring the car on that track.  I'm not going to let you fucking drive it.  I see what you do.  Come on.  What happened to him?  That was impressive in the M5.  Now nothing?  Yeah.  Because it wasn't his car.  That's the difference.  It was great.  Right up to his car.  I could smack my own car up.  I've done that one before.  All right.  Thanks for having me.  Hey, no problem, man.  Thanks, guys.  Come back and see us.  You look real unplanned.  Don't change your thing.  Oh, thank you.  Top Gear premieres tomorrow, like Ant said, 9 p.m.  on the History Channel.  See you.  I think we're out of here.  Yes, we are. 
[03:29:00]  See you tomorrow.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Eric, I think your intern just got fired in here.  Wait, what?  I was going to talk about Chicago, but I think your intern just got fired.  Which one?  Which one do you think?  Looking around the room, there's only two in there, so I'm going to go with Uncle Kevi. 
[03:29:30]  All three are in here.  Yeah, Rob's in the corner.  Oh, I didn't see Rob.  Okay.  Rob's doing work.  I'm still going with Uncle Kevi.  Yeah, I think Travis just fired Uncle Kevi.  Oh, no.  Yeah, if I have the power to, I just don't want him.  What did he just do?  He's just...  Besides, when I said, go in there and clean the studio, he got up in a huff.  Well, here's what happened.  I said, don't huff, it's your job.  Yeah, that's the thing, is that he doesn't want to do his job.  He doesn't want to do anything, so why is he here?  I don't know.  If he doesn't want to do anything, and he doesn't know why he's here, then he shouldn't be earning 
[03:30:00]  college credit in place of some other kid who probably really wants this job.  Did he just say, I don't know what I'm doing here?  No, but I'm saying, if he's huffing and puffing, that he's got to clean the studio with every  other intern.  And if he walks in here talking about something, and I ask him what he's talking about, and  he just smiles at me and says, I don't know?  He came in, and he goes, oh, today they're going to blackmail me.  And I didn't even know what he was talking about.  And it was in reference to my show.  I didn't know what he was saying.  And so, one of the interns hands me a tape of, I guess, him talking shit about somebody. 
[03:30:30]  And he goes, oh, they're going to blackmail me.  And I go, how do you know they're going to, who's going to blackmail you?  And he goes, well, Sal was recording me.  And then Travis goes, Kevi, what are you talking about?  And Kevi goes, I don't know.  And then Travis goes, no, I just heard you talking.  Yeah, I'm asking him a serious question.  And if he thinks that everything's like, I just don't know why he's here.  And then he keeps saying, I don't know.  And I go, like, Travis, does it anger you to have to talk to him like he's your kid? 
[03:31:00]  And Travis goes, no, because he's just being a fucking asshole right now.  And then Uncle Kevi was smiling.  Yeah.  So why is he here?  Why is he getting college credit for not doing anything?  Kevin, comment?  No, he doesn't have a comment.  I don't know.  Is that really?  Like, yeah.  You don't care?  He's just being an asshole.  Just get out of the studio.  Kevin.  Kevin.  Hey.  Get out of the studio. 
[03:31:30]  Go.  What goes on?  I have no fucking clue.  I said, he was getting all pissed off.  Why can't I go clean the studio?  I'm like, because Opie and one of the bosses were here.  And Sal even said it to him.  And as I came in, I said, okay, the boss is gone.  Hope's gone.  Go in and clean the studio.  He hoffed and puffed again?  He got, he hoffed and puffed for not doing any work.  And then he got pissed off because we told him to do something.  Is he in there now, Sal?  Yes.  What's he doing? 
[03:32:00]  I just don't know why he's here.  He's still confused.  I don't know why he's here.  And then this happens in this studio, but I'm in there, so I didn't hear it.  You're not expected to.  You know why?  Because you expect the interns to just come in here and clean up the studio and do their  job.  Like they've done every day.  You shouldn't expect that something's going to happen in the three minutes.  Yeah, let him out of your sight for minutes.  He's not, you know, three.  He's a 20-year-old intern. 
[03:32:30]  So what goes on now?  What happens?  Now I've got to figure out what I'm going to do with him.  Does Travis care?  Travis isn't happy with him.  You can't fire him.  Yeah, but that's the thing.  He doesn't care.  He's got, what, two weeks left on his internship?  Yeah, he's done next week.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  And he already asked me for Friday off.  If he leaves, but if...  So then take off.  Take off Friday, take off every day before that, and take off every day after that.  I don't think that's a bad idea.  But if he leaves early, does he get credit for the internship?  I mean, of course he doesn't care if he's still going to get credit for the internship. 
[03:33:00]  I don't know.  I've got to check on that.  But are you moving to ending the internship early without credit?  We've done it before.  Yeah, we have.  Rarely.  I mean, he has...  Well, the thing is, it's like when there are interns who come in here, he's always done stuff, but...  What has he done?  When we had him do things, he's done them.  Like what?  Pulling drops and setting up the studio, doing the runs. 
[03:33:30]  He does do it.  You know, and he doesn't usually screw that up, but...  He's screwed up a lot.  He's just screwed up as a person.  And like, I mean, and that's like he comes in and he doesn't care.  Like when Travis just kicked him out.  Like Travis was yelling at him.  I had to kick him out three times before he listened to me.  Who are you texting him with?  This would be Pat Duffy.  What's he say?  In times like this, do you miss my work ethic?  Yeah.  I mean...  Pat Duffy's always got to make it about himself, doesn't he?  Yeah, he does. 
[03:34:00]  Who's Pat Duffy?  Nobody remembers Pat Duffy.  Exactly, yeah.  Who's Pat Duffy?  Sal, is Kevin in there like worried at all?  No.  No, he doesn't give a shit.  He doesn't care.  So why is he here?  Can you ask him why he's here?  Kevi, why are you here?  Did you say I don't know and smile?  I'm going to go in there and grab him.  He's smiling.  Okay, tell him why is he here.  Kevi, why are you here?  What did he say?  He's giving like a sarcastic ponder.  Okay, then tell him to go home.  Tell him to go get his stuff and he can go home. 
[03:34:30]  Uh, you can get your stuff and go home.  Okay.  Is he moving?  Now.  No, he's still sitting now.  Now, go.  Now, go.  Is he going now?  No, he's still sitting here.  What the hell?  What happened?  I have no idea.  You can't physically remove him.  He's just sitting there?  This is the most incredible sight.  Like, we've always had dumb interns and stuff.  But they've never been like...  I'm fed up with him.  Like, they just don't do anything.  Like, he won't even leave.  Hang on.  Eric's coming.  Get up. 
[03:35:00]  Wait.  Wait, what?  Is this a part of a bit?  No, this isn't a bit.  You don't know what you're doing.  Oh, and he left.  He left.  He thought it was a bit?  He totally thought it was part of a bit.  It wasn't on the air.  Yeah, it's not a bit.  Most of it was off air, yeah.  Yeah.  And it's not a bit.  Like, the only reason we were talking about it on the air, because it happened right before  the show went on, but it wasn't...  We wanted to talk about Chicago.  What was the bit?  There was no bit.  He walks in, starts blabbing about blackmail, and we all want to know what he's talking about. 
[03:35:30]  Eric's yelling at him right now.  Can you hear him?  Or is it outside?  It's outside.  Okay, go outside real quick, and just listen for like 10 seconds, and then tell us what  he's saying to them.  I'll be right back.  Like, people just say bit, because they hear it.  Oh, a bit.  Like, do they not know what a bit is?  Like, a bit has to also have a payoff, and like, some kind of structure about it.  Like, there's a reason to do it, and it's...  My ineptitude is a bit.  Usually planned, on some level.  What happened?  Eric was saying he doesn't know what's wrong with him. 
[03:36:00]  Eric, like, Eric's yelling at him, saying, I don't know what's wrong with you?  Yeah, he just has no idea why.  No, and when Eric Nagel is yelling at you, saying, I don't know what's wrong with you,  it's bad.  And Eric doesn't know what to do, because Eric doesn't even know he's...  Okay.  Eric's yelling at him.  I see him walking down the hall.  Eric's upset now, too.  You just can't...  Well, because it also makes Eric...  I want to pull my teeth out with my hand.  Yeah, right?  It makes Eric look pretty bad, to tell you the truth.  And this is not a shot at Eric.  I'm saying this is why he's mad, because when the interns don't do well, it's not a good  reflection on him.  And when they're, like, to the level of Kevin, like, it's crazy. 
[03:36:30]  We're not even doing anything.  He's like, I didn't do...  He's like, I wasn't doing anything.  I'm like, that's the point.  You weren't doing anything.  And then when I told you to do something, you got huffed.  I didn't huff.  He said, everyone in there heard you huffed, that I told you to finally go in there and  clean up the studio.  And then I said, and then Travis got upset, and I wasn't even in there.  I just asked him a question.  So what did you...  Did you actually send him home?  And he goes, why is this a bit?  It's not a bit.  That's a problem.  It's not a bit.  And he goes... 
[03:37:00]  And I said, you start talking about shit, and nobody knows what you're talking about.  And he goes, well, Sal told Rob to go get this stuff.  I said, Kevin, if this was a bit, Sal would then tell Travis or Sam or whatever that, hey,  this could be a good bit.  Not you introduce something that nobody knows what you're talking about.  And that's the thing, I don't...  And a minute before the show goes on either.  I don't even care about that.  Like, you want to come in here, like, the second you're allowed to come in here and start,  like, talking about something?  That's totally cool.  Right, even if you are...  But then when they ask you what you're talking about, and you just, like, smile and say,  I don't know. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, and then when you're like, no, really?  What are you talking...  Before the mics come on, by the way.  Travis is doing all this before the mics come on.  He was still smiling when I told him.  I said, look, you need to go get your stuff and go home.  Yeah.  Okay.  So he is going home?  Yeah, I sent him home.  Man, and then...  But, yeah, and see, the other thing is, too...  I didn't want to do this today.  I didn't want to send him home.  And now you're also going to have to have meetings about it to find out whether it was justified you  sending him home, and what's a bit?  You are assuming that someone's listening to this show.  You're right.  You're right.  No, I think it's justified.  But, yeah, they're going to...  Well, what happened on the air was... 
[03:38:00]  Because Kevi is going to start talking about bits.  He doesn't even know what they are.  It wasn't on the air.  The problem wasn't even on the air.  It was off the air where the problems were.  I was just commenting on it as it was happening.  I didn't see it.  I saw him go into the office.  Yeah, I might want to go see if my book bag's still there.  Yeah, why don't you go...  He doesn't even know what his looks like.  Go see.  Sal's going to go see if he's actually leaving or not.  No, never mind.  No, go ahead.  No, no.  No, no.  I'll forget it.  Don't worry.  Okay.  Another time.  Sal's running down right now.  There's Roland down at the end of the office. 
[03:38:30]  And the Ron and Fez interns are just...  You know what?  Setting up the studio.  As good as can be.  It's crazy.  I'm looking at the Ron and Fez interns like,  Look at these guys.  Can I use this time right now?  Two model interns.  Yeah, they're just working.  Sam, can I use this time right now to do a plug?  Oh.  I guess.  It seems like an odd time.  I would like you to go to  SiriusXM.com slash internships.  And if you want to intern for the Opie and Anthony program  and the Opie and Anthony channel,  select it right there.  There is an option.  And we are taking applications for new interns 
[03:39:00]  for the fall semester.  Okay.  So it's SiriusXM.com slash internships.  Internships.  Yeah.  And say you want to intern for us,  but how hard is it to find people who want to do...  Like, if you want to do something in radio...  Let me just point out...  It's the biggest show in the world,  Opie and Anthony.  Let me point out...  I'll use our channel because it's a...  You know, we know personally,  but since we got our internship program back,  right?  Well, maybe, excluding Sal or maybe not,  you could see the decline of the people who... 
[03:39:30]  Not just for our show,  but just in this industry in general  that people want to do an internship  and learn how to do all this stuff.  This is the easiest three credits ever.  It's something with that age group.  They just don't want to do shit.  And it was actually declining  before we had the internship band.  I mean, Love Buzz was the most notable intern before that.  But we were looking for characters at that time.  Kid walked into the office.  He went,  I guess I'm going home.  Bye-bye.  And he heard Eric talking about him  and he was just smiling while he was packing his bags. 
[03:40:00]  Did he leave?  Yeah, and then he left.  It's so weird.  He has two weeks left.  I actually thought they were done this week  and I was about to talk to the rest of them.  He was smiling.  He goes,  he was like so happy you were talking about him.  He asked him,  can I get Friday off?  And I said,  this is your last week.  No, I have one more week.  And I checked.  I'm like,  all right,  they do have one more week.  But he's already asking for all this time off.  Well,  Connor and Rob are still fine, right?  The other interns?  Pool Party Rob?  I like Opie's name for him.  Pool Party Rob instead of handsome Rob. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, I think that's good.  Pool Party.  Jesus.  I mean,  it was just weird.  It wasn't even like  a crazy,  like,  a happening was going on here.  Yeah,  this started out of nothing.  I mean,  it was the right move,  I think,  to send him home.  Yeah.  But,  you are going to have to have meetings and stuff now,  Eric.  You know that.  Yeah,  I'll talk to people.  But you stand,  you stand right in what you're saying.  Where's Rob?  Rob's sitting here right behind me.  All right,  send Rob in.  Rob going. 
[03:41:00]  I want to see what's going on in this internship class.  Kevi,  Kevi came to me.  Don't grow a mustache.  Oh,  you don't like it?  Yeah,  what's going on there?  It's such a hipster mustache.  It's so fucking dumb.  Leave me alone.  It's a hipster mustache.  You're never going to get left alone if you start walking around here with a mustache  like you're someone's dad.  You look dirty.  Maybe that's what he wants.  You look like an asshole.  Go ahead.  He wants people to pay attention.  Exactly,  he does.  And then go,  what do you mean?  Why are you being a mustache?  I just grow a mustache.  I'm not going to shave this mustache this week.  They're going to talk to me.  Exactly.  No,  that's not the point.  What were you going to say?  No,  Kevi said to me this morning,  he said,  oh,  I have nothing to do again today. 
[03:41:30]  And I said,  Kevi,  this is like the fifth time you've told me that.  And you're only here three times a week.  Nothing to do.  You have nothing to do.  I've given him stuff and he does do it.  Plenty of stuff to do.  But when there's an hour left in the show  and maybe he's done with what I had for him,  he'll sit around,  well,  I have nothing to do.  I'm like,  well,  then sit in here and wait for the show to be over.  What's going on with Kevi,  Rob?  You're his fellow intern.  He,  I don't know.  He sucks.  He does?  Yeah,  he's horrible.  He's just,  he's a nice kid.  Is it the teaching?  Is it Eric's fault?  No, 
[03:42:00]  it's not Eric's fault.  He's just the laziest kid you will ever meet.  I've never met anybody lazier.  Really?  No one.  It's not a tough job.  No,  it's not.  It's fun,  actually.  Look at all this stuff going on.  It's the Open Anthony show,  for God's sake.  Yeah,  put it through,  put some assassination calls through  and just call it a day.  So I messed up.  Yeah,  I did.  I messed up.  Listen to the first hour of the show.  Rob did not do well as a screener.  Well,  you know what?  I learned.  Like,  I learned from my mistake.  You did?  Yeah,  and I will never do that again.  Jack.  Jack in Vermont, 
[03:42:30]  you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Oh,  hey boys.  Hey,  I think you guys are going about this the wrong way  given the history you've had with the interns,  especially you,  Travis.  I mean,  didn't you kick one of them in the balls,  you fucking vagina?  You see the phone screen.  It wasn't there,  but,  uh,  no.  Seriously.  I mean,  this kid.  To let you know,  I hung up on him before.  There wasn't,  this isn't a matter of,  I don't even know what that guy's talking about  because like I said before,  this isn't a matter of like,  goofing on an intern.  He came in  and he just started talking 
[03:43:00]  and he would,  not only would he not do anything,  he wouldn't even answer a question.  If you don't want to be here,  then don't be here.  That was the thing.  Like he,  you'd say,  okay,  well,  why aren't you doing anything?  I don't know.  Well,  what do you want to do?  I don't know.  Do you want to go home?  Yeah,  I want to go home.  Then,  all right,  then go home.  Then go home.  That's what it was about.  It wasn't about anything more.  Rob,  are you dreading the fact  that this internship is ending?  How is Rob as an intern,  Eric?  Rob's good as an intern.  Sal?  Oh,  fantastic.  Good intern?  Yeah.  Better than you were? 
[03:43:30]  No.  Absolutely not.  And Rob,  do you think you'd make it better?  If you were hired right now,  do you think you'd make a better staff member  than Sal has?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do you think?  I mean,  your internship doesn't have that many days left.  No,  I know.  You can speak candidly.  I'm really,  really bummed it's going to end.  Like,  I've had such a,  this is one of my best summers.  Yeah,  he told us on Thursday  that this was his best summer ever.  Is this better than summer camp?  Yeah.  Wow.  You went to a lot of summer camp.  I did.  I went to one.  Okay,  that's what I thought.  For many years.  Eight,  nine years.  Eight,  nine years.  And this is better. 
[03:44:00]  Rob's tearing up a little bit.  I am a little bit.  Did you purposely throw the pool party  in conjunction with the end of the internship  kind of celebration thing?  Yeah.  I don't know if it's going to have a great turnout.  That's fine.  It seems like it's just become a nickname  more than anything.  I don't think the guys are actually going to go.  You don't think anyone's going to go  to pool party,  Rob's pool party?  Well,  I think you made a mistake.  You invited everybody to the pool party  two weeks in advance  and between the invite and the party  was the big Chicago live gig.  Your pool party's not going to be more fun 
[03:44:30]  than Chicago was.  I doubt.  So like,  if you had invited them on Tuesday,  say,  like tomorrow,  and said,  yeah,  it's on Saturday,  then they have something to talk about.  And then they're like,  oh,  then the excitement builds up this week.  Whereas last week,  the excitement started to build.  But then we had Mike Tyson.  You're welcome.  Then we had CM Punk in Chicago.  You're welcome.  You know,  all this stuff is going on  and the pool party is kind of...  Pool party's this weekend?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  It's not as exciting as it was.  It's this weekend.  Here's what you do.  Sal threw out his invitation. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, Sal.  I am busy that day.  Doing what?  I have to go out and grow a facial hair.  Didn't even tell me, though.  You've been working on that mustache  for six months  and it's barely anything.  Rob,  here's what you do.  Yeah.  New invitations  to just remind everyone.  Well,  I told him to make RSVP cards.  Hey,  did you forget?  Kevin,  in Houston.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, boys.  Hey,  I don't think it's Eric's fault  that the interns,  or not all of them are terrible,  but this Uncle Kevvy  is obviously worthless. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  There's a whole goddamn generation  of kids that are  in college now.  They're just lazy  because their fucking parents  have done everything for them  all their lives  and now they're out in the real world  and they have no clue  as to what to do.  Rob,  do you think the fact  that all you have to do  is that you know  a delicious deli sandwich  is a phone call to mom away?  Do you think that's cost you  a certain amount of work ethic?  No,  I don't think so  because I,  I mean...  I was well taken care of  as a child  and I have a very strong work ethic.  I was well taken care of also,  but I also have a strong work ethic. 
[03:46:00]  Well,  you have a work ethic.  I don't know.  I mean,  I consider it to be pretty good.  I may mess up at times.  I saw a lot of effort  in those invitations.  There was a lot of effort.  But like...  Kev,  sorry.  I almost called Eric Kevvy.  Eric,  how would you describe  Rob's work ethic?  Is it strong to quite strong?  Yeah,  I'll say it's strong  to quite strong.  That's not bad.  What about Connor's work ethic?  Connor is too,  just Connor sometimes  lacks a little common sense.  You're like,  oh,  I thought you were going  to say confidence.  Common sense.  That's going to bring  his confidence down. 
[03:46:30]  I like Connor.  Yeah,  no,  Connor has,  I think,  the strongest work ethic.  Better than Rob's?  Yeah.  There's a handsome thing  going on.  Is it because Rob,  because you know  that if Rob were hired,  he'd be better than you  as a staff member?  That's definitely the reason.  That's why I was on Team Connor.  Yeah.  Connor will,  you know,  he will go above and beyond.  Sam wants to make sure  he can alpha dog,  whatever.  Yep.  So you're saying  Rob will not go  above and beyond?  I'm not saying he won't,  but Connor does it more often.  Rob?  You know,  I mean,  I haven't really seen  Connor 
[03:47:00]  do a lot.  Go above and beyond?  No,  he has not a lot.  No,  he does a lot.  He does a lot.  I haven't seen him  go above and beyond,  but like,  I mean,  I'm usually doing phones,  he's usually doing  something else,  so I don't really know.  Now,  do you think,  if you were hired,  I don't even,  I mean,  he's a douchebag,  we know that,  but we're looking  at a picture now.  Listen,  that's one of the reasons  I like him.  Pool Party Rob's,  Pool Party Rob's  Twitter handle  is RobertBobert105.  No,  RobertBobert105.  RobertBobert105. 
[03:47:30]  Very funny.  RobertBobert105.  And he's got a picture  of himself  at Giant Stadium,  I guess,  seeing a,  it's the same fucking thing.  Where do the Giants play?  Giant Stadium.  At MetLife Stadium.  All right.  He's going to see this concert  and he's got the horns up  and he's X-ing his hands  and he's got a cowboy hat on  and he's got his dumb.  It is a Corona  wicker straw hat.  I was pretty  hammered.  Yeah.  Did you buy that hat?  I did.  Oh,  Jesus Christ. 
[03:48:00]  Well,  listen,  Spencer's.  At Spencer Gifts  before the,  you're not even at the event.  What?  Why'd you go see  Kenny Chesney?  I don't know.  I like him.  All right.  I like Kenny Chesney.  I like Tim McGraw.  Do you think you'd be  a better staff member  if you were hired  than Sal is?  No,  I can't say that.  Why not?  Because I'm not hired  and Sal does  more stuff than I do.  They all go downhill.  Do you think  that's what would happen?  Yeah,  once everybody gets hired,  that's all.  That didn't happen to me.  No,  I mean,  it didn't happen to like,  you know,  the,  the,  the initial staff members. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Something about  post 2006,  everything just went to shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sal,  would you agree  with the,  uh,  uh,  sort of idea  that's come across lately  that you have,  your stock has  dramatically lowered  since getting hired?  No,  I have,  I have more work  that's a little bit  more behind the scenes,  a.k.a.  Eric's work.  Oh,  so you're saying  that the reason  that people don't think  you're as good as you were  when you were an intern  is because Eric's giving you  a lot of his work.  Yes.  Well,  I'm not saying, 
[03:49:00]  I do a lot of Eric's work.  Wow.  Eric,  are you giving Sal  a lot of your work  to make you look better?  Eric sits back there  for four hours.  I don't know what he's doing.  What is he doing?  I know what both of you  are doing.  You're both having  some like weird.  Fan fictions?  No,  they're having some weird  like let's take pictures  of each other  and post them on Twitter thing.  I'll talk about that  in a minute  because that's,  I'm definitely glad  you brought that up.  But are you giving him  a lot of your work,  Eric?  No,  not really.  It's work that was  originally Eric's  that I've just adapted,  you know,  that.  Adapted or adopted?  Yeah,  I adopted.  You changed it?  Yeah,  I changed it,  made it better.  Well, 
[03:49:30]  so,  why is the perception  then that you don't,  you're just not  what you were?  I don't know.  Are you,  do you still think  you're a go-getter?  Sal's like Facebook stock.  Yeah,  he is like Facebook stock.  Sal was all,  when it was free,  it was all like,  oh,  all I see here is potential.  Once we actually monetize it,  it's like,  well,  there's no way  to make any money with this.  This is ridiculous.  It's just a fad.  Like,  wait till this thing  gets a little older  and the next new thing  comes along.  For instance,  Twitter.  For instance, 
[03:50:00]  Pool Party Rob.  I've just taken on jobs  that are more behind the scenes.  Like what?  Just like Facebook  keeps adding things  and adding things  and you're like,  ah,  I don't like this anymore.  So you time-lined it  and you realize now  that might have been  the wrong strategy.  Yeah,  exactly.  No,  but I do things  that aren't as creative anymore  because I'm occupied  with doing the more...  Like what,  Angry Panda?  Angry Panda,  exactly.  After that,  I was like,  fuck it.  Do we have a copy  of that production piece yet?  No,  because Opie smashed the disc  and threw it out.  Do you have the original  somewhere?  Nope.  I lost the session.  Don't order it.  You haven't. 
[03:50:30]  I don't.  Rob,  if you were a good employee,  I'll have to dig back  through the show.  You would...  Keep everything.  Eric,  the one thing I'll say about Eric  is as many times  as we've made fun of him,  when we call him on some shit,  he will eventually  give us the incriminating files.  Well,  I mean,  I...  Right?  Even if he buries it at first,  if we say,  you motherfucker,  you buried this,  give us the file,  he will.  You can find it.  It's in the show.  I don't remember  when the show was.  I swear I don't have a session.  Well,  here's what I'm going to do.  Eric,  since you give Sal his work,  apparently,  could you please assign Sal 
[03:51:00]  to find the Angry Panda piece  when it played in show?  I can definitely do that.  That should probably go above all.  I don't think he's doing anything right now.  No.  That's true.  So today,  today,  at some point today,  you can leave the after show  if you want,  or you can do it later,  but at some point today,  you need to find the Angry Panda piece  because now it's been referenced  multiple times  and nobody knows  what we're talking about.  No,  I have no problem getting it.  It was a horrible piece of production  that Sal submitted.  The worst thing that's ever  gone over the on-day channel.  But you didn't think that  when you submitted it.  No,  no.  You thought it was great.  You're like,  wait till I get a load of this. 
[03:51:30]  It's time for Sal  to hit next generation level.  Creativity is pouring out of my veins.  No.  No.  You know what's pouring out of your veins?  What?  Behind the scenes.  That huge scream behind the scenes.  Rob,  do you think you're more  the creative type?  You can handle that  better than Sal does?  No?  Yes?  That's the best.  Thank you.  All right,  so focus is not your strong suit.  No.  Okay.  I distracted him  because I'm looking at the picture  of him on a Segway  with a helmet on.  He's a fucking idiot. 
[03:52:00]  We all know that.  But he's Kevining out right now.  No,  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I'm kind of like  right in the middle,  I feel like I am.  Right.  Well,  that's what we're looking for.  I'm pretty creative.  Middle of the road.  I'm creative,  but I'm also  good at,  I'm just good at a lot of stuff.  You're just a guy  who doesn't want to admit  that you're bad at anything.  I'm really good  on the air  and in front of the scene,  but I'm also behind the scenes.  I'm great too.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying like,  I,  I'm like, 
[03:52:30]  I'm never like the best  at anything,  you know?  Why don't you work on that?  Well,  because,  Jack of all trades,  master and nuns?  Yeah.  Why don't you work on that?  Yeah.  What are you going to be  the best at?  I'm going to be the best  on air.  On air?  No,  you got two weeks left.  That's not going to happen.  I'm not going to put you  on the air.  Are you going to be the,  I'm going to be the best  phone screener.  I'm going to be the best.  How about this?  Intern.  I'm going to be the best.  What about,  well,  you're not going to be the best intern.  You don't have enough time  to make up for it.  So,  I mean,  you've done too much damage.  So you're saying 
[03:53:00]  Connor beats Rob.  Oh,  the best intern of this class?  Yeah.  Oh,  you could be the best intern  of this class  because Kev is disqualified  and you're definitely  better than Connor.  How's Connor feel about that?  Thank you.  Tell Connor,  I'm sorry that I said  that so blatantly,  Eric.  Connor.  He's not listening.  Oh,  tell him I said that,  I blatantly said that  Rob was better than him  and that I'm sorry I said it.  He said Rob's better than you  but he apologizes.  That's okay,  I'm cool with him.  Okay.  They're cool.  Connor just goes with the flow.  He goes with the flow.  Are any of these guys  coming back next semester,  Eric?  I asked all of them  and they all can't.  You're not coming back?  No,  I really want to. 
[03:53:30]  Why aren't you coming back?  I got school.  He doesn't want to leave  summer camp.  School.  You got a school in Pennsylvania?  Yeah.  You should transfer.  I can't.  I'm already in my senior year.  Big deal.  What's that going to do for you?  Who cares?  Alright,  well,  are you realizing yet  the depression  that's going to set in?  Yeah.  Do you listen to the show?  Yeah.  He's going to hear  all the fun we're having.  Yeah,  you're going to hear  the next fun intern.  Hey,  I was there.  We're not going to mention you again. 
[03:54:00]  No.  You know what I mean?  After your internship's over,  it's not going to happen.  Do you remember that guy  that had the hat on  at that concert?  We'll be like,  no,  no,  I don't remember him.  But we got this new intern  who's fun to hang out with  and that'll be that.  We'll be like,  oh,  he's having a pool party.  It's the middle of fall  but if it were summer  we would totally go.  Something like that,  you know?  Yeah.  period where I was  back in Syracuse,  when it really hurt,  I called the show  at one point  to say something.  I don't even remember  what I was saying.  And Travis was always cool. 
[03:54:30]  I talked to Travis  the whole time  and I talked to Danny  the whole time  and Eric the whole time  and Travis was like,  oh,  Sam,  ha ha,  because I was  the fun intern.  You know what I mean?  They're like,  oh,  it's fun that you're  on the phone  and I called the hotline  and put me on hold  and you know what  Opie did?  Never went to you.  He let me sit there  for half an hour  and then he went to break  and that's when I realized  it was over,  I sat on the phone  for a half hour  in my dorm room  and then the show  went to break.  You were Bobo.  And I realized,  oh,  I want the guys  to talk to me.  I started tweeting. 
[03:55:00]  No,  I mean,  I realized it was over  and it was painful  and then they started  talking to the other interns  and talking about  how great they were.  Oh,  this guy's hilarious.  I love this guy.  You know how much  it hurt when I heard  Opie or Anthony  or Jim go,  I love this guy  and he was talking  about an intern.  And they didn't mention  me,  not once.  And when I called  in that time,  I waited on the phone  for a half hour  and then they went  to break.  It hurts,  Rob.  And that's something,  but you know what I did?  I picked myself up 
[03:55:30]  by my bootstraps  and I just started  showing up.  I just started going.  I just started showing up.  That's what I did.  I started,  I said,  Uninvited.  Uninvited.  I would be like,  first it started  with me being like,  hey,  Travis,  I'm going to come,  okay?  And he'd be like,  he'd be like,  yeah,  sure,  come by.  And I would show up  at like 830  to just say,  hey.  And he was like,  oh,  showing up at 830,  huh?  And he was just like joking.  But I took that  as my invitation  to always show up  when I would have 
[03:56:00]  as an intern.  And from that moment on,  anytime I had a day  off school,  I showed up  five o'clock in the morning.  That's right.  I remember that.  And I would just be there.  And like,  they had an intern  who would videotape,  but he was only  in three days a week.  So whenever he wasn't around,  or whenever he was  in the bathroom,  I don't care,  I would just grab his camera  and start filming.  And I took his spot.  I took every spot  I could take  until I got to  the top of the mountain.  Sal,  on the other hand,  is like,  oh,  you're just going to  hand me a job.  Cool.  I'm going to take  some sick days  and show up later.  No, no,  I'm very appreciative 
[03:56:30]  of my job.  I'm very happy.  I'm going to stay home  and shit  instead of going to work.  That's all good.  You know,  I don't think my stock's lower.  I just do Eric's work for him.  Can I go home early again?  Sure.  He's my mustache.  He's just over.  I'm going to grow a mustache  in my free time.  I didn't have free time  to grow a mustache.  You know,  I didn't grow any facial hair  for the first three years  I was employed by this company.  You know why?  I didn't have time.  I was so busy.  You know how many days  Sal,  I was like,  oh,  I don't know why  they keep me here  until two.  I was here all day. 
[03:57:00]  I lived here.  I still do.  There wasn't any  sort of like,  what's my hours?  Can I go home  before my hours, Rob?  No,  that didn't happen with me.  No.  I didn't have time  to shop for V-necks  and go to concerts.  No.  I didn't have time  to create this hipster identity  that was phony.  No.  No,  because I still live  with my parents.  I didn't have time  to do that, Sal.  And Rob,  that's what you should  be paying attention to  as you move forward.  Not somebody like Sal  who's looking  for the easy way out.  Who's like, 
[03:57:30]  oh yeah,  I know Mark Zito helped me,  but fuck that guy.  I'm going to follow  in your footsteps.  Mine,  not Sal's.  Sal's a terrible role model.  How do you feel  about that, Sal?  That's awful.  I know,  it is for him.  I'm sorry that you have,  this is the guy  you have to look up to.  It's okay.  I'm going to start.  This is the last intern  and it's like,  really?  That's all I have to do  to get to my spot?  I worked very hard  as an intern.  Hard.  I work hard here  and that's it.  Worked hard.  Did you hear that?  He said,  I worked very hard  as an intern.  Yeah.  I work hard.  Yeah,  he's starting to get,  we go one level down. 
[03:58:00]  Well,  you've already got the job  so you don't have to  work that hard,  right?  Next it's going to be  I work here.  Sal used to come,  yeah,  I work here.  I am here.  It will be the next thing.  I'm present.  And then it will be  I'm physically present.  And then,  remember when Sal,  he used to come in  every Sunday  and he used to be  on the Sam Roberts show  as the phone screener,  the hungry little intern.  Probably still does that,  right?  And then he got hired  and I said,  Sal,  you're not going to come in  on Sundays anymore.  And he goes,  why?  Am I not allowed?  And I said,  no,  of course,  I would love to have you  but now that you're hired  you're going to lose  the hunger and the motivation. 
[03:58:30]  And he goes,  no,  I'm still going to come in.  It wasn't four weeks  before he goes,  you know,  Sam,  the commute's getting long  and it's a long bus ride  and you know,  I just want to have  my Sundays back.  Mustache club is on Sunday.  Mustache club.  I don't even have time  to grow that mustache  I've been wanting to grow  and it is my Sunday.  He said,  you go take your Sunday.  Four weeks,  huh?  You know when  the last time  I had a two-day weekend was?  College.  School. 
[03:59:00]  That's good,  but I just,  I wanted to have  a full weekend.  I'll bet you did.  And I came in a lot.  I was there  from the inception  of the Sam Roberts show  on Sundays.  This show's been around  for six months.  How long could you  possibly come in for?  All the way back.  You were in black and white.  Exactly.  You came in for like  three months  where the Sundays.  You remember  the Sam and Sam show?  No,  I've been giving this company  my weekends forever.  You hear that, Rob?  I do.  And you know what I am?  Happy.  Every day of my life.  I'm not miserable.  I'm not miserable either. 
[03:59:30]  I love my job.  All right,  well you're about  to be miserable.  Eric,  why don't you play  Angry Panda?  Don't get the panda angry!  I know,  it's terrible.  It's terrible,  it's...  There's that panda noise.  It's a lion.  It's so bad.  You know what happened,  Rob,  when Sal brought that in?  Well,  a room full of hosts  just looked at him.  Like,  what are you doing that for?  And comics.  And comics.  Tom Papa was in here  like,  oh,  I created the  Angry Panda thing. 
[04:00:00]  Tom Papa started calling him  Angry Panda  and he looked at Sal like,  you ruined it, man.  I created something  and you ruined that for me.  And Sal was like,  whatever,  I guess that's the last piece  of creative production  I'll ever do then.  And it was.  It was.  He quit.  Yeah.  You know how many things  I've quit at?  Zero.  None.  None.  Ever.  I just try to improve.  That's what I do.  You,  when the going gets tough,  the Sal get going.  You know?  He gets going somewhere else.  He goes home,  he goes to his facial hair club, 
[04:00:30]  he goes on YouTube  to find hipster videos  so he can dress like them.  Bike rides.  He goes on bike rides.  I don't have time  for a bike ride.  He goes driving  when he's too sick.  Exactly.  He jumps in a sports car  when he takes a sick day  and has his little...  He looks for an art  museum.  Yeah.  Stand diagonally  with his friends  in the wrong direction.  Ironically.  Ironically.  You mean E-Rock?  That's right,  I mean E-Rock.  But Sal,  you can't deny  any of this is not true.  Or you can't deny  that any of it is true 
[04:01:00]  is what I should say.  No,  I think I work hard here.  I do a lot of  behind the scenes work now.  Eric,  do you think he works hard?  Do you think Sal works hard  or do you think  he works adequately?  I think Sal,  when I see him,  works hard.  That's because when you see him,  you're giving him  all your work.  Plus,  and it's also,  it's Eric.  That's true.  We're lowering the standard.  He is working hard.  Oh my God.  You've been up for what?  Ten hours now.  You're working hard.  Why ask me?  When was the last time  you took a nap?  Do you think Sal,  do you think Sal works  like he worked  when he was an intern? 
[04:01:30]  Or do you think  he tries to go home  early every day?  No,  you're on top of that  when Sal goes home.  I don't have any authority.  No,  I know,  but you like to keep tabs  on when Sal goes home.  Because he was told  when he got hired  that your hours  are until 2 p.m.  Yeah.  And I'm like 2 p.m.  I would love to go home  at 2 p.m.  And Sal's like,  2 p.m.,  huh?  You're lucky  if I'm here  until 1.30.  Wow.  I got shit to do.  I gotta go on a bike ride.  And what?  So he can go home  and go on a bike ride.  You know what I do  when I go home?  More work!  Really? 
[04:02:00]  Yes.  Well,  that's terrific.  That's why,  and I got shit  to show for it.  You,  what?  Nice calves.  That's all you got.  Because you just go home  and go on bike rides.  You see that picture  Jim took of my calves  that he put on Twitter?  No.  They're terrible, Sal.  They were pretty crazy.  They're so skinny.  They're horrible.  But when do I have time  to work on them?  Never.  Why?  Because I'm honing my craft  as a broadcaster.  He said you had  cancer patient legs.  Cancer patient legs, Sal.  I don't have time  to go on a bike ride  and work on them.  What does that say to you? 
[04:02:30]  Well,  I like to stay in shape.  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong with that is?  I go home  and I stay physically active.  The problem is  that it's coming,  first of all,  it's not helping  your bowels anything.  No,  it's definitely not.  And second of all,  it's coming at the cost  of your work.  The work should come first,  Sal.  Rob,  I hope you're paying attention.  You should be writing  some of this shit down.  You gotta be careful, Sam.  Why?  You might make the panda angry.  What happens  when the panda gets angry?  Get the panda angry! 
[04:03:00]  I'm gonna go delete that  out of the left.  That's gotta be burned  on the CD.  Yeah, yeah.  I want like multiple copies.  Put it in every folder  in the left, please, Eric.  Done.  You can do that for me?  I sent it to your,  I texted it to you.  Good, good.  I got the file  on my personal  cellular telephone now.  Billy in Philly.  Hey, what's up, guys?  First, I wanna say  at not Sam  on Twitter.  There it is.  And see,  you don't see,  nobody wants to plug  Sal's Twitter.  You know why?  Because he's a lazy  son of a bitch.  He wants to go  on a bike ride.  He'd be too lazy  to read it.  Yeah. 
[04:03:30]  And second,  I wanna say,  Sam,  I hated you before,  but now you're incredible.  Somebody tweeted  something really funny  last night.  Somebody tweeted me  that they wanna jump  off a bridge or something  every time they hear me  on the radio.  And so I quoted him  and said,  trust your instincts.  And then so,  like,  a bunch of people  started bashing the guy  who said they wanted to,  they started bashing  the guy who was bashing me.  Somebody quoted his bash  and wrote,  God,  that's so 2006.  Now,  if my call's good enough,  hopefully there's some 
[04:04:00]  Troy stuff available still.  What kind of Troy stuff?  But for Kevi.  Oh,  oh,  oh,  oh,  some,  some garage sale stuff  or whatever.  Let's see,  yeah,  Troy,  if you're listening  and you have any  moving items,  bring him in.  Okay,  Kevi,  what happened with him  is when he came in,  he wanted to be  the wacky guy  and recognized  as the wacky guy.  And when it didn't happen  towards the end  of the semester,  he said,  I don't care anymore.  Right.  He might have a point.  That was his deal.  Nobody wants to be  the good intern guy.  No,  people, 
[04:04:30]  yeah,  you know what?  How about the positive  attention intern?  Yeah,  he comes in and he's like,  hey,  I'm going to be the wacky guy  and then that doesn't work out  and he doesn't really  want to do work.  Now,  Troy,  you can speak honestly with me.  Do you think  that Sal's work,  he works hard  or he works adequately?  I'm not saying  he doesn't do anything.  Does he work hard  or does he work adequately?  He does a good job.  But is it,  like,  is it above and beyond  or is it adequate?  Well,  when he was an intern,  he was a house on fire.  But now is he just a house?  Well,  I mean,  he does what he's told.  The police department  has arrived 
[04:05:00]  is what you're saying.  He does what he's told.  He gets his job done.  The air conditioning is on.  It is a comfortable  living establishment  is what you're saying.  It's been rebuilt  and it is an easy hang.  There's a sports car  in the driveway.  Let's put it this way.  There's no reason  to rush home  from a bike ride  to put the fire out.  All right,  what do we got for Bill?  Let's give him...  Should we...  Bill can either  get my silverware...  Okay,  that's nice.  A Jesse James book.  I don't think it's signed. 
[04:05:30]  Oh,  no,  it is signed.  It's signed to me,  though.  Okay,  that's still fun.  And a Nikki Sixx,  the art book  that he did  of his photography,  signed by Nikki Sixx.  Oh,  wow.  Okay,  so you could get...  I feel like the silverware  is worth two books.  So you can either get  the silverware  or the two signed books.  Do you think that  two autographs  are worth as much  as Troy's used silverware?  It's not even good silverware.  No,  he shouldn't be saying silverware.  He should be saying,  here are my forks and spoons.  Yeah,  there's no forks in here either.  It's just knives and spoons. 
[04:06:00]  So,  but if you want to go home...  You want to play knifey,  spoonie.  You want to play knifey,  spoonie.  No,  there are forks.  I'm sorry.  There's some forks in there.  Well,  that's like a personal item.  You know what I mean?  That's a real collector's item.  Yeah.  Whereas the autograph books  or whatever.  Troy should sign that.  Is Troy going to sign  any of the forks?  Do you want the forks  or do you want the books?  I don't know.  How many forks?  There's a whole thing  full of them.  And you get knives and spoons too.  You get a whole...  You can eat at home  with some guests  like Troy does.  There's a lot in there.  I don't even know.  There's a couple of soup spoons. 
[04:06:30]  So go on,  Bill.  What do you pick?  The books or the silverware?  Well,  first I got to say  follow at Poncho Pirate.  And second,  I got to take the forks.  Okay.  The cutlery goes.  Thank you, Bill.  I'm going to put you on hold  and Connor is going to  take your information  like a good intern should.  Rob.  Nick in California.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  I wanted to thank you.  I feel like you're giving me  a pep talk right now.  Yeah. 
[04:07:00]  Well, I am.  I'm giving everybody  a pep talk.  It's great.  I'm driving to work right now  in my first meeting  of the morning  and I don't want to go there  and I was considering  calling to cancel it  and go back home  and go to bed.  No.  And now after listening  to you talk,  I can't.  I have to go  and I have to put in my time  and I have to do my best.  Right.  Go to the fucking meeting  and be a rock star  and leave people talking.  Who was that Nick guy?  He fucking regulated this meeting.  He is the best arborist there is. 
[04:07:30]  That's exactly right.  Thank you, Nick.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I hope I've made that kind of impact  on a lot of you.  You know who's made an impact on me?  Steven Singer.

I was able to maintain  a relationship.  I was able to get married.  I was able to create  a full life  all while  maintaining a successful career 
[04:09:00]  where I was working my ass off.  That's fantastic.  You, on the other hand...  Thank you, Rob.  You, on the other hand,  are putting in...  You're punching a card  so you can get home,  ride your bike,  and grow mustaches.  That's not the case.  Like I said,  I'm very happy  that it works here.  That's how it comes across.  And you know what?  Reality is made up  of two different things.  Intention  and perception.  Intention can...  You can do all you want  with intention.  You have to worry  about fixing the perception.  And you know what? 
[04:09:30]  Maybe the problem  with the perception is  your intention  is not what you think it is.  Right?  Am I right, Troy?  Sam's always the pep talk guy.  That's right.  You give all the interns  the pep talks.  Well, I'm trying to get  these fucking kids...  I'm trying to,  as you said,  light their houses on fire.  That's right.  You know what?  I'm going to light  your house on fire, Rob.  I've got to tell you, though.  I've got to tell you something.  For the MVP award  for the broadcast up here...  Yeah?  Goes to Rob.  Wow!  Not even to Sal!  No, Sal does that sound.  No, but Rob gets it.  But Rob gets it.  I lost my shit here  the other day.  Yeah, he was losing his shit. 
[04:10:00]  I was fucking crazy.  Jesus Christ.  Even with two helpers,  you can't get it done.  Rob, on the other hand...  It was not my fucking fault.  Yeah, right.  I hadn't excuses now.  No, Rob killed it.  Rob handled his shit.  What did he do?  He was in charge  of loading the replay.  He was taking it over  and I said,  get it loaded  and once it's loaded,  I'll come over and check it.  Came over?  Perfect.  This is like Sal 2.0, this Rob.  Yeah, but if you'd hire me,  it would just kind of just...  No.  No way.  It would be mediocre.  Downgrade?  Yeah.  No way.  Would you?  Do you think?  No.  You'd fucking regulate it, right?  110% all the time.  You would let your own house on fire. 
[04:10:30]  You know what would happen?  We'd stop getting those cookies.  No, you would not.  Guess what?  Say, get your own cookies.  Guess what?  Cookies still come from my mom  and I've been here  for seven fucking years.  Okay?  I don't quit.  Listen, we have to go.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Make sure you check  facebook.com  slash Opie and Anthony  for all the pictures  and stuff from Chicago.  Thank you, Chicago.  I didn't get to talk enough  about you today,  but that city is a magnificent place.  Awesome.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye, everybody.  Don't get the panda angry! 
[04:11:00]  Opie and Anthony's show  is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
