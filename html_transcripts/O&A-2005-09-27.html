<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, engaging in their typical vulgar banter, insulting their staff, Ben and Steve.  They then discussed a "taser bit" they'd been doing, expressing frustration that Howard Stern (implied) had seemingly copied it.  Numerous callers phoned in, some mentioning birthdays, others inquiring about the taser bit and an upcoming "golden ticket" giveaway.  The conversation shifted to a gas station in Lynnhurst, NJ, with unusually low gas prices causing long lines and police intervention.  The hosts mocked the absurdity of the situation.

Comedian Joe Rogan then joined as a guest, detailing an online feud with Carlos Mencia over joke theft, playing audio clips of Mencia's comments. Rogan described his website post detailing the accusations and expressed his disdain for joke theft in comedy, citing Mencia and Dennis Leary as examples.  He shared graphic anecdotes about his experiences on *Fear Factor*, involving eating maggots and horse manure. Opie recounted a comedy show where he and Mencia performed, claiming Mencia secretly watched Opie's set and was later pressured to admit Opie was funny, mentioning video evidence.

Bill Burr joined the conversation, corroborating Rogan's frustrations with joke theft.  The discussion expanded to the lack of accountability for plagiarism in the comedy industry. Rogan discussed his financial success from *Fear Factor*, describing his extravagant lifestyle.  The hosts and Rogan discussed UFC, detailing fights and injuries with graphic descriptions.  A bizarre phone call with "Wheelchair Fred" involved graphic descriptions of sexual acts and an on-air masturbation segment. The hosts discussed Carlos Mencia's upcoming appearance on the show, framing it as a confrontation. They also discussed the FCC, censorship, a study linking left-handed women to a higher risk of breast cancer (with Rogan's humorous reaction), and the accuracy of online information, specifically IMDB.  They celebrated XM Satellite Radio reaching 5 million subscribers.

The show then transitioned into a discussion about left-handedness and its correlation with breast cancer and intelligence,  followed by a discussion of Bill Burr's high school experiences, including finding marijuana before a test, dropping out, and dating underage girls.  An audio clip of a doctor discussing the left-handedness/breast cancer study was played. Several songs were played, including a poorly-received Katrina survivor tribute song and a Stephen Lynch song.  Congratulatory messages for XM Radio's subscriber milestone were interspersed. The conversation shifted to hybrid vehicles and a claim that high gas prices were necessary to justify their higher initial cost.  A lengthy discussion about the existence of a giant chimpanzee species, the Bondo ape, ensued, with a caller, identifying as a primatologist, vehemently disputing its existence.

Another segment began with a discussion about listener complaints regarding Rogan's loud microphone, leading to a bit about a fictional product, the "O&A Party Rock."  A significant portion involved playing and mocking a listener-submitted, poorly-written Katrina tribute song, using highly offensive language. Rogan shared a highly graphic and racially charged story about his first sexual encounter with a Black woman.  They mocked another listener-submitted song, a Lacey Peterson tribute.  Further discussion included Rogan's dislike of marriage, bad movies, and a listener's story about an unexpected sexual encounter. Al Jorgensen (Ministry) joined the show.  A recording of a song called “He Wants It” by “Gangsta Fag” was played, prompting more raunchy discussions and jokes.  Topics included presidential politics (Bush and Reagan), and the hosts' opinions on celebrities and music.  Multiple celebrity endorsements for XM Radio were played.

The final segment featured Al Jorgensen recounting a creepy experience at Graceland, his drinking habits, and numerous injuries and medical mishaps, including a brown recluse spider bite, a severely infected toe requiring amputation, and the explosion of his tour bus during Lollapalooza.  Callers phoned in, one suggesting Jorgensen change his name and another asking about his early music (which he confirmed was ghostwritten). He expressed frustration over an embarrassing moment shown on ESPN.  His 1983 music was played, followed by discussion of his amputated toe and promotional plugs for Joe Rogan's Comedy Connection in Boston. The tone remained highly irreverent and punctuated by numerous expletives.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshats.  These dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  We look like assholes right now, man.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Oh, fucking idiot.  Oh, fucking idiot. 
[00:05:00]  If you're planning a road trip this weekend,  it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along for the ride.  Beyond AM, Beyond FM is XM Satellite Radio.  Asshole!  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole.  Hello, hello, hello.  Something doesn't sound right.  Did something change over the evening? 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  I had to crank up the headphone volume  to hear the Rage Against the Machine music there.  Uh-oh, you cranked your headphone volume up even higher.  Way high.  Uh-oh.  And then you start playing clips,  and then those just took out my hearing.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Wow, why are the phones exploding?  And why aren't these people listening to us?  Jesus Christ.  Bastards.  Let's say hi to Scott in New Jersey.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, everybody.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  I didn't want to start your day off in a bad mood, 
[00:06:00]  but it turned out on while I was waiting for you to start up,  and he's playing all kinds of taser clips  and how great they are and everything.  Yeah, it's starting to get a little weird over there, man.  I got to tell you.  You know, there's a paranoia thing that happens in radio,  and then there's obvious shit.  We've been doing this whole taser thing for, I don't know,  two or three weeks now,  and all of a sudden it pops on his show today.  Jesus.  Even longer?  Yeah.  Maybe a month?  Yeah.  He claims he doesn't listen.  Yeah.  The people that claim they don't listen actually listen a lot. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  That's just how it goes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you guys call up Howie today  and tell him where he got the fine bit he's doing today?  It's a wonderful taser audio, Robin.  Didn't he invent the taser?  He invented everything.  I think so.  Don't you know that?  Yeah, back in the late 70s.  All right, guys.  How are you going?  Thank you, friend.  He is such a lazy fuck.  A lazy fuck.  Brian, what's up?  Wouldn't you be lazy, too?  500 million. 
[00:07:00]  I turned on this morning,  and I heard the taser audio,  and then two seconds later I hear Hook Nose talking.  I thought you guys switched back to FM.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, no thanks on that one.  Thanks.  Mike in Buffalo, what's up?  We lost Mike.  All right, let's say hi to Chris.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Yeah, hey.  Good morning, Joe.  What?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, Chris, what's going on?  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, I was talking about the taser bit,  since everybody already covered that.  My next question is,  when are you guys going to give out your next golden ticket? 
[00:07:30]  We're working on one right now, actually.  And who might that be?  We're working on it.  We'll have to, I don't know,  working on it.  We take a little longer to give out golden tickets.  It's easy to just scan the FM wasteland for people and bring them on board.  We actually wait, take our time.  Yeah, we could have brought Bubba with us and decided not to,  and then, you know, the other company thought it was a great hire.  The likes of the radio chick.  Yeah, have fun with the radio chick. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, no thank you.  But thank you.  Thanks for sticking up for us, you guys.  The phones have just exploded with Howard doing the stupid taser bit.  Yeah.  That we've been on for a long, long time now.  It just seems like someone over there is listening,  hearing the clips,  and then finding them and popping them on the show.  And going, wow, this is a great idea.  Let's bring this to Howard.  Seem to work on Opie and Anthony.  He's a lazy fuck.  He doesn't do anything original anymore.  Hasn't for many, many years. 
[00:08:30]  And we call him out on it every day,  and he just sits there and takes it.  Anyway.  Good morning, Bill Burr.  How are you today?  I am excellent, and how are you?  I'm doing good.  Oh, the CD's in?  Yeah, there's nice credits in there, too.  We got credits in the new Stephen Lynch CD?  Nice.  Oh, and a party rock?  That's pretty cool.  Oh, and a party rock.  The battle cry.  It says, you know, in the credits, whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And it says, Ope, Ant, Jim Norton, Ben Sparks.  That's why Ben brought this in today.  Ben Sparks. 
[00:09:00]  I made the credits, though.  Oh, wait.  That's our old producer.  Never mind.  Ben Sparks, Sex Fagel, and the crew at the Opie and Anthony show, XM Satellite, channel 202, ONA, party rock, Stephen all at foundrymusic.com.  Very cool.  You can do coke off the case.  That's very cool.  You sound like a parrot.  That's what he sounds like.  We got to play more of these clips today there, Nathaniel. 
[00:09:30]  Get with the boys and figure out which ones we need to play.  But Stephen Lynch has a new CD out.  He's going to be on our show in the near future.  The Craig Machine is the name of the new Stephen Lynch CD.  Yeah.  He continues just to blow up.  Good stuff.  Blowing up all over the place.  We should talk about the gas thing, because we were all, just before we went on the air, we got distracted with the stupid hoo-hoo thing.  But here in New York City, I guess the average gas price is $2.87 a gallon in Jersey, I guess.  I think it's $2.87 a gallon. 
[00:10:00]  I haven't found one where I go for gas under $3.  Everywhere I go is $3 or more.  And premium and stuff gets into the 360s.  Oh, yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Crazy.  You're taking rings off your finger.  Yeah, it's insanity.  Who the fuck is going to the premium tank at this point?  Is there any reason to use premium gas?  Haven't they refined it enough where a regular is just dandy for your brand new car?  I don't think you... 
[00:10:30]  People don't keep their cars long enough to worry about that premium shit.  No.  I think if you have like a Maserati or something like that.  You think that's it?  A Lamborghini, you're pulling in, you need that premium gas for that premium engine?  Yeah, but if you have a car like that, they like bring the gas to you.  Because I've never seen a Rolls Royce, somebody sitting there.  No, I've never self-serve pumping the gas.  On their Ferrari or their Rolls.  Platinum AMX coming out the window.  We don't accept these.  What is this, my friend? 
[00:11:00]  This is not strip club.  This is a VIP card.  Yeah.  So, there's a weird thing going on in Jersey today.  The average gas price is $2.87.  I believe that's what they were saying on the news.  All the news crews are at this stupid gas station in Lynnhurst.  Where's Lynnhurst, bro?  It's not that far away, actually.  It's not that far away from where I live.  It's maybe 15 minutes out of the city.  It's a perfect opportunity for an assault on the media with only days left in the September contest. 
[00:11:30]  I'm telling you right now.  When they're going to the gas station story, there's no problem.  New Orleans is completely rebuilt.  Everyone's fine and dandy.  Oh, yeah.  Their houses are done.  All fixed.  Everyone moved back in, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  I already booked our flights for Mardi Gras.  Is that right?  We're all going to Mardi Gras.  Trust me, dude.  We got your beads.  Trust me.  I saw a commercial, actually, yesterday for the New Orleans people.  And the whole vibe was basically, things are still fucked up down here, people.  Hello.  Yeah.  Hello.  I saw that one, too. 
[00:12:00]  It's like black and white.  And they do like a montage.  And they show crying children, people in boats trying to get out.  And it's like, what?  What was this?  That happened?  That happened somewhere?  Yeah.  We have, you know.  It's not raining anymore, you know?  Yeah.  Fine.  Pick up some sticks, you know?  I went out today.  It's dry.  It seemed fine.  We all did our part.  Yeah.  Even we did our part.  The Opie and Anthony auction ends Friday.  We gave.  We gave.  And now we got to move on.  Hey, that's reality, though.  That's it.  You can get pissed off all you want at us, but that's the reality of the situation. 
[00:12:30]  People just move on with their lives and other TV coverage.  Yes.  Anyway, so it's 287.  So this gas station in Lindhurst, I guess it's an independent gas station or whatever.  It's not part of one of these big chains.  Yeah.  So he's selling his gas for $2.67 a gallon.  $0.20 difference, okay?  $0.20 difference.  A gallon.  All right.  Do some math.  You got an empty tank holds about 15 gallons in your average car. 
[00:13:00]  What is that?  $30.  That would be $3, right?  That's $30.  What?  No.  You're saving $3.  $3.  To fill up a 15-gallon tank.  $3 from get empty.  Yeah.  But what these people are doing, they're waiting on line for a really long time.  Right, because the line's crazy.  Or they're circling around.  A gallon spends like $8 in gas if you're waiting to get up there.  Look, we all want to save money, but at times it's just not worth it. 
[00:13:30]  And these people are waiting on line, and it's getting to the point where other businesses  can't do any business because they're blocking, you know, the driveways and parking lots,  whatever.  So they had to get cops involved.  So now cops are giving tickets and shooing.  They're doing the old shooing.  Shoo.  Shooing cars away.  So what the cars are doing, they're circling the block over and over again until a gas pump  opens up, and then they pull into the gas station.  All to save $0.20 a gallon. 
[00:14:00]  Somebody's going to sue about that.  $0.20 a gallon.  And I don't get it.  Why would you go through all that trouble to save $3?  Hey, shit adds up, you know?  Yeah.  That's it.  You know, not everybody's a millionaire.  You're not really saving either.  You go there twice, you get $6.  You're burning it up, sitting in line. 
[00:14:30]  Three quarters of a movie ticket.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're idling.  You're driving around the block.  That's a box of goobers right there.  Just the inconvenience of going out of the way, waiting on a gas line.  I can understand saving $20, $30, $100.  That's cool shit.  But saving $3 to go through all that hassle?  Most of the people are driving, you know, out of the way just to get to the gas station?  Yeah, pack a lunch and spend $3 a gallon.  Right.  And I was telling Bill and Anthony just before the show, you know, at the end of my dad's life, you know, our relationship came down to, like, eating and talking about where the cheapest gas was to be found. 
[00:15:00]  Is that it?  Oh, my God.  I mean, there was more to it, obviously.  But my dad would always be calling me up, telling me how much, you know, how much he was saving on gas.  On gas.  And telling me where this gas station was.  And it would always be out of the way.  And it would always be maybe a nickel or a dime cheaper.  That was it.  Not even 20 cents.  Like a nickel cheaper. 
[00:15:30]  Is it our generation?  And I did this way before I started making real money.  I never gave a shit about what the price was at the pump.  Unless all of a sudden I pulled up to some obscure gas station.  It was $12 a gallon.  Exaggeration, obviously.  Yeah.  But as long as it was in some kind of range that I understood in my head, I never thought twice about it.  Right.  It's like doing homework.  I always felt like, you know what I mean?  Like, you got to sit there and, like, compare prices.  What's the closest?  What's the easiest?  The most convenient.  There is equity in just being convenienced. 
[00:16:00]  Not having to go out of the way.  Having the familiar gas station right there.  Maybe it's got a little quickie mart.  You know what you want to get in there.  King Cone or something.  Yeah.  Plus the ones that sold the cheap gas.  You'd always pull in and they would literally have, like, shrubs growing up through the asphalt.  Yeah.  I'm not going in here.  Guy probably has water in there.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up, man?  Rogan.  Joe Rogan.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's happening, man? 
[00:16:30]  I'm sorry I'm late, but I had a...  What's up, dude?  I wrote a tirade about Carlos Muncie on my website this morning.  I was reading that.  I stayed up all night.  I stayed up all night.  I got to my hotel room at, like, I don't know, like, five o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  I was like, shit, let me just, like, sleep for, like, an hour.  And I'm like, fuck, I got to write this.  So I sat down at, like, five o'clock in the morning.  I had a Red Bull.  This was, like, number three.  This was my second pot lollipop.  Wait, what is that lollipop?  It's a pot lollipop.  Pot lollipop.  Are you kidding?  No, no, I'm not kidding. 
[00:17:00]  What?  Does it get you fucked up?  Well, fuck, yeah.  Yeah, dude, if you don't smoke pot, this will put you on fucking Pluto.  You'll be, like, pinned to Pluto, spinning around its face.  This is going to be the best show of the week.  It is 7-17, and I am guaranteeing this is the best radio show of the week.  This is why I stayed up.  I got an email the other day from this guy in Tucson.  He goes up with a Red Bull in a pot lollipop.  Yeah, fuck it, bitch.  I guess we just wrap up the whole gas talk. 
[00:17:30]  What are you talking about, gas?  Well, yeah, it's expensive.  Let's move on.  No, no, really fast.  Really fast.  There's some dumb gas station in Jersey that's selling it for $267 instead of $287,  and people are losing their minds over it.  Wow.  And the news has to do a ton of coverage on it,  and we're thinking of we're going to probably attack the live TV crews today down there.  We'll see.  I guess that's it.  Go get them.  We'll get back to that some other day.  It's funny.  You knew to drop it, yet you still went back into it like there was going to be something.  I'm a radio guy.  I've got to wrap it up a little bit. 
[00:18:00]  Just wrap it up.  I'm going to make it tidy.  And acknowledge it like, okay, we're going to take that, and we'll put it over here.  Because, look, all the phones are going crazy.  Like, yeah, let's talk about gas for 20 minutes.  Why people need premium.  I've got to talk to Eric in Colorado.  All right.  Eric.  Hey, Eric.  Yeah.  Quickly, why do you need premium gas?  All three of my cars require premium unleaded.  What is that?  What car?  I've got a 2001 Audi with a twin-turbo V6, and I've got a 2004 Dodge pickup with a Hemi that's a high-performance upgrade on it, and anything less than 91, which here in Colorado is 91 octane. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  They run like shit.  Really?  Your turbos?  Yeah.  So all your turbo vehicles need the premium?  Yeah.  Very good.  Like I said, no one needs a premium.  Well, we've tried running the lower grade, and the cars don't run worth a shit.  All right.  You don't do the premium gas, do you, Joe? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  You do?  I don't give a fuck.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Clear the phone lines.  Joe Rogan's got some shit to get off his...  All right.  So this is what happened.  I get this email the other day from this guy who's a radio DJ in Tucson who says that Carlos Mencia was talking shit about me on the radio.  Do I want to listen to it?  I say, okay.  So he sends me the audio file, and it's Carlos basically saying that he came to the comedy store and that he went on after me and that everyone in the comedy store calls him the Punisher. 
[00:19:30]  He's completely out of his fucking mind.  And that the only reason why everybody says he steals jokes is because they're jealous, which is insane.  Because have you ever heard anybody saying that Chris Rock steals jokes or Dave Chappelle steals jokes?  No, but they're more jealous of Carlos Mencia than Chris Rock.  All right.  Here's the problem with this guy.  He lives in such a shallow glass house.  Carlos Mencia claims to be Mexican.  His name isn't even really Carlos Mencia. 
[00:20:00]  That's a fake name.  His real ethnicity is he's half German and half Honduran.  And his real name is Ned Wholeness.  This is real.  This is all real.  I didn't know that.  Mitzi Shore invented the name Carlos Mencia to ingratiate him with the Latino community of Los Angeles.  So this fucking retard...  His name is Ned?  Yeah, his name is Ned.  Yeah.  He's got a fake name.  I mean, this guy's so fucking stupid.  His whole reason...  His whole reasoning for why people call him a thief is that they're jealous. 
[00:20:30]  They're jealous of him.  This fake fucking Mexican living this fake life stealing people's material.  All right.  So what he says is basically that...  I got the audio, by the way, if you want to go through it.  What?  Him on stage?  No.  Oh, of the show?  Yeah.  Oh, that's beautiful.  You want to do that or what?  It's short clips.  We can.  Sure, sure we can go on.  But what's even better is what I did is I put the audio on my website and I have a...  I hired a personal cameraman.  So my cameraman happened to be there the day Carlos claims that I was watching him from the stage. 
[00:21:00]  And instead, what we have is me on stage and him watching me.  Pacing around the room.  Watching me from...  The guy imitates everyone, including me, all the time.  He steals from everyone, whether it's George Lopez or Paul Mooney or old Richard Pryor albums.  The guy's a fucking idiot.  And all he does is rehash other people's shit or rewrite other people's shit.  You know, you do a joke about going to the fucking zoo, whatever it is.  And if it kills, he'll do a joke about going to the zoo and just rewrite your shit. 
[00:21:30]  He's a weak-minded fucking simpleton.  And he doesn't know that people know he's a weak-minded simpleton.  Wouldn't it be great to be able to hear this shit and then go like,  Fucking Rogan, I'm going to kick his ass.  But Rogan's such a fucking animal.  You can't kick his ass.  Well, I mean, why would you want to kick my ass?  Because I'm telling the truth?  That's the crazy thing.  I'm not running around saying that great comedians are shitheads.  I love comedy.  And there's the whole point.  The thing that I wrote on my website, JoeRogan.net. 
[00:22:00]  The whole thing I wrote this morning at 5 o'clock in the morning with no sleep is that I'm a huge fan of comedy.  To this day, still am, always will be.  You know, if I'm at the comedy store and Chris Rock shows up, dude, I'm the first person who wants to sit down.  I want to watch great comedy.  I love it.  I love somebody who's got a unique point of view.  I love somebody who comes up with some new shit that they crafted.  I know this guy sat down on his computer and wrote this all out and tried it on stage in 15 different comedy clubs.  And then, boom, there it is.  You're like, whoa.  Like, I remember when Rock was at the comedy store and he was working out his Oscar shit. 
[00:22:30]  Dude, like me and like 10 other guys sat in the back of the room fucking howling.  Loving it.  Love comedy.  Hate fucking thieves.  That's all it is.  I hate fucking thieves.  Does it fucking infuriate you?  I know the kind of...  I don't know Ned.  Just call him the phony Mexican or Carlos Menstilio.  That's what we call him.  What he's talking about, like, the most brutal thief isn't the guy who just takes your whole joke. 
[00:23:00]  It's almost like mad libs.  Like, they'll just, like, say he's saying you go to the zoo and you got a bit about a gorilla.  He makes it an orangutan.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, he was taking a shit.  Dane Cook did that to me.  He was taking a dump.  Dane Cook did that to me.  He did it on premium blend.  He did my joke about fucking tigers.  He did it with rhinos.  Genius.  Fucking genius.  You know, there's so much of that shit going on.  It's fucking insane.  It happens in radio all the time, too.  Of course it does.  But the new thing in radio is like, ah, everyone steals from everyone, so it's okay. 
[00:23:30]  Fuck that.  That it is.  You know, I love when you guys do something, you credit people.  That's the way to do it.  And that other douchebag that was, you know, doing a shit on Channel 152 that you guys were  torturing for a few days.  Oh, Jim Phillips?  Yeah, that fucking idiot.  That was awesome.  That was fun, wasn't it?  That was one of the last shows I listened to before I got a new car, and I have to get  an XM on my new car.  Joe, you ever have somebody come up to you, right?  You just did your set.  You killed.  Some bitch just killed, and somebody comes up to you and is like, yeah, you know, I used  to do some shit like that.  And you know they're lying. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I used to do a bit like that, but it's a little different.  You don't have to worry about it.  You can still do it.  You can still do it.  You're a weak-minded cocksucker.  You know what the best one I ever got?  I had a guy actually say, you know what?  I was thinking of doing some shit like that.  Oh, that's funny.  It's just like, what, after I said it?  Coincidentally, they bring back their old material that they never did in the first place  because they now set it up by saying that they used to do that material.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  And what's really brutal is comedy clubs don't do anything about it, man. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, it's just the most frustrating thing in the world for a comic to know that your art,  what you do, what you put out is supporting this club, keeping it together.  But these people like fucking cannibals.  And they hire these scumbags, these fucking thieves, these just fucking simpleton cocksuckers  who can't come up with anything.  These weak-minded motherfuckers who just, just rehash your shit.  And these comedy clubs hire them.  And they expect you to all work it out.  They expect, I've actually heard that argument. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, you guys got to work that out with yourself.  You fucking know!  He's a thief!  You fucking know!  No one calls someone a thief that's not a thief.  There's not one person I've ever heard called a thief that's not a thief.  Have you?  Have you ever heard one person called a thief that's not a thief?  It doesn't exist!  There's thieves and there's regular comedians.  But those thieves, they fucking make it through.  They sneak through the net, somehow or another, because the comics don't do anything about it,  because the club owners don't do anything about it, these motherfuckers, they swim upstream 
[00:25:30]  and they make it.  And they have millions of dollars and they're driving fucking fancy cars.  And everybody goes, well, you're just fucking jealous.  And you're just sitting there going, holy shit.  Holy shit!  Is this for real?  Is this for real?  I guess in comedy, it's just completely accepted.  It's not!  These people are fucking pussies!  They're afraid!  They're afraid of conflict.  They're afraid of standing up.  It's less accepted in comedy than radio, definitely.  Because these guys are always bitching behind the scenes.  Yeah, but they're bitching behind the scenes, but then, like you said, the comedy clubs  don't do anything.  The comedy clubs, the comic is probably the last priority in the comedy club. 
[00:26:00]  Like, it's just, get someone in there that's going to make these people fucking pay.  Right.  And that's pretty much their priority.  Oh, yeah.  They don't care about the comics or the fucking, like, they're supposed to be some kind of  ethics or some kind of, you know, you guys are supposed to work things out.  Yeah, we're supposed to work that.  How many asses are in the seats?  How many asses are you putting in those seats?  That's it.  How many asses are in the seats?  Well, let's play this audio, because now everyone is very interested in what Carlos  Mencia had to say on the Frank show.  And you can go to my website, it's all up, along with the video that my cameraman got 
[00:26:30]  of Carlos watching me in the back of the room, all that shit.  And if you ask nicely, he'll tell you how to get the pot lollipops.  You've got to get a prescription.  A prescription?  Yeah, I have a prescription for medical marijuana.  They're not shitting me, they are prescription lollipops.  I went to a doctor, I said, I have headaches.  He said, when do you have headaches?  I said, whenever I think about the fact that pot's illegal.  And they just fucking write you out a piece of paper, and you go to a cannabis club, and  you can buy weed.  A cannabis club? 
[00:27:00]  Dude, I have pot soda.  I have pot lollipops.  If you just were locked in my house, you could get high for six months.  You would never have to leave.  Weird, I've never seen those at a pharmacy, though.  No, they don't exist at pharmacies.  How do you get a prescription?  Will you take a prescription to a dealer?  I'm going to be at the...  There's a...  Fuck, I forgot where it's playing.  Shit, it's on my laptop.  There's a...  The Stoney Awards are in New York City, Wednesday night.  And...  Fear Factor won for...  It's a High Times, the High Times Awards. 
[00:27:30]  All right, all right.  Fear Factor won for Best Reality Show, and I won for Best Reality Show Host.  And so, go there, wherever the fuck it is, and people will show you how to do it.  I wasn't able to watch Fear Factor for the longest time, because I can't fucking stomach  the people eating shit.  But for some reason now, I've broken through.  I don't know what happened.  There was, like, nothing on.  I'm flipping around.  I see Rogan.  I'm like, all right.  And it wasn't an eating thing.  It was like they're fucking dangling from a chopper waiting for their leg to fall off 
[00:28:00]  or something, and Rogan's laughing at them.  And I'm watching, and I kind of get into it.  I get caught up, and they get to a fucking maggot-eating portion, and now I'm involved  in these people in the competition, so I can't just tune away.  Because now I saw who won the fucking dangling from the helicopter thing.  And now, I've broken through, and I can watch this.  And Joe is just as disgusted as I am watching this shit.  I don't know if he is, though.  He is so disgusted.  He's a good actor, though.  I don't mean him skeeve out at this shit. 
[00:28:30]  I don't act.  It's not.  The eating stuff definitely disturbs him.  Yeah.  It smells so bad, and it's all real.  They're all just really gagging and shit.  They have mouthfuls of maggots.  They're eating horse assholes.  Yeah, and I'm like, you can do it.  Hang in there.  Shove it in your mouth.  Come on.  You're almost there.  And they're eating horse assholes.  Big round meat donuts of horse ass.  You've got eight more.  You're not lying.  You're not lying.  Eight more.  Eight more.  You can do it.  You've got 20 seconds. 
[00:29:00]  Come on.  Yes.  Oh, they're gagging.  And I can't even believe it's a fucking job.  I know.  I show up for work every day going, really?  Really.  They haven't caught on to this yet.  All right.  One more.  Are you amazed how long the show's been on now?  I thought it was going to be canceled immediately.  It seemed like it would be like maybe an eight-week run or something like that.  Yeah.  It's been on for years now.  Six seasons.  And I thought when they...  Six seasons.  Six seasons.  This is season six we're working on.  I thought when they brought the fucking kids on, and I swear to you, that it was a joke.  I thought I had switched, maybe mad TV or something, and I thought it was a joke because 
[00:29:30]  I said, there is no way they are going to allow children to dangle from helicopters, to  fucking fall in the ocean, to eat fucking maggots or something.  And there they are, and there they are, actual little children, with Rogan just the cheerleader  there.  Come on, kids.  We're going to run you through a combine and then have you spit out the other side. 
[00:30:00]  The crazy thing is, it's a huge show with kids.  Yeah.  It's a really big show with families because there's no nudity and there's no violence,  which is rare on television.  So the whole family can sit around and watch everybody gag on animal pigs.  I saw one where these little kids had to jump.  They're being towed by these boats.  There's three of these little round rafts, and they had to jump from one to the other  and give their father a flag.  And then the father had to jump back and put the flag back again.  Well, this one kid does a perfect job. 
[00:30:30]  He's hanging on to the edge.  The father gets the flag.  He hits the kid and knocks him clean off the fucking raft so he can win.  So he just threw his kid into the water.  The boats doing like 40.  He didn't care.  Kid's gone.  I'm howling.  I'm howling.  How is this even allowed?  You and me both.  Me sitting on the dock going, whoa.  For real?  And then the chicks, they get on there. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, are you banging those chicks?  It's way too many problems with that.  I would gather that would be the wrong thing to do.  Reverse Paula Abdul.  It's not a good move.  Yeah, I would guess that would be a bad thing to do.  You can look, though.  You can gawk.  And they don't have enough shots to cut away from you not gawking sometimes.  Gawk openly.  Fuck it.  Everybody knows I'm a pervert.  Good.  Film me.  You're going to a reaction shot of some guy just going by in a boat  because they don't have any footage of him not looking at our tids.  Someone wants to know if you ever threw up there. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, I threw up once at home, actually.  I've never thrown up on the set.  One time during the first season, there was this chick who was drinking a mouthful of worms.  She was a glassful of worms.  And she got him in her mouth, and she tried to swallow it.  And she'd...  Like, violent.  Like a cat.  Like a cat.  Like, you know when a cat just pukes up the hair?  And there's this violent noise.  And she couldn't touch it with her hands, so she's, like, scooping it up with the glass. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, man.  And she gets it back in her mouth, and her hand is fucking shaking,  and she's sweating, and tears are coming out of her mouth.  And she's gagging.  I'm at home.  I just...  I put my finger over my mouth.  It's running down my hand.  I ran into the sink.  Just chucked my burrito all over the sink.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my girlfriend is laughing her fucking ass off.  She was just crying laughing.  One of the worst things.  Joe comes out, how was your day at work?  Oh, they had this... 
[00:32:30]  Well, it was on television.  Hectile vomits.  Watching it live didn't do it to me, but watching it on television with the close-ups and the music...  Yeah.  Like, every time it's, like, they're, like, gagging...  The music, like, no!  The worst is when those maggots are put in the fucking blender and pureed into this  white nastiness, this yellow pus-like consistency with just maggot shell all mixed in, and they  have to drink the smell. 
[00:33:00]  I think I would rather do that than actually have them alive in my mouth.  Really?  Crawling around.  I've never seen the maggot...  Oh, when I have to transfer it from one thing to another.  Oh, that's nothing.  The big mouthful.  Mouthfuls are nothing.  Because you spit it out, you hold it, and you spit it out.  It's the swallowing.  That's the hard part.  And then the meat byproducts that you guys come up with, with the horse's ass and the  other thing.  Can't do horse anymore.  Watching people eat that.  Can't do horse anymore.  Really?  Why is that?  Too many people complained.  Really?  Too many horse lovers complained.  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:30]  Peter?  Yeah.  No, horse lovers.  Well, Peter must just hate the show anyway.  You know what was really funny, very ironic, was Wendy's was a big complainer.  They complained, and they suggested that we never do that again.  Meanwhile, they kill like a fucking hundred million cows in here.  Yeah, exactly.  Isn't that insane?  Like, don't kill the horses.  Oh, don't kill the horses.  We don't even kill them.  I mean, we just find the parts.  People eat horses.  Yeah.  It's a common.  And a lot of the horses are used for other things, and I'm sure the stuff that you're  using for them to eat is supposed to be used for other stuff. 
[00:34:00]  I don't know, man.  Wasn't that an episode all in the family?  Not in this country, right?  Wasn't that an episode all in the family?  Edith served Archie some horse.  Right, right.  And it was cheaper than steak, and he enjoyed it.  Yeah.  There was a lot of guilt involved.  And it was all meathead making horse jokes as he was eating it.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  All right, should we play the audio?  Sure.  Well, I want to hear what this is all about.  Carl Smith, see you on the Frank Show in Arizona there.  So what were you going to ask me that you got all interested in?  We were talking about your website, and you said there's, like, hate mail and stuff on 
[00:34:30]  there.  Oh, I get great hate mail.  Why?  What's it about in regards to what?  Great hate mail.  Well, I got a flood recently because somebody went on Joe Rogan's website and asked him about  me, and then he said that the force was weak with me, basically saying that I'm not  you know, all that.  What does that mean?  The force?  You know, the Star Wars.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The force is weak with him.  What is he trying to say?  Whatever.  That I suck.  And so then he put a link to my website.  So a bunch of his fans came on the website and, like, just put a bunch of hate mail on 
[00:35:00]  there.  And I had to school him because I've been doing comedy longer than him.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  If anybody took anybody's style, it wouldn't be me, him.  It would be him, me.  Right, right, right.  Because I was the one with HBO specials in 1994.  Right.  Nobody knew who Joe Rogan was in 94.  I didn't know who he was.  Yeah.  And Local Slam in 93.  Nobody knew who he was.  And Comedy Composite is in 92.  By the way, pause it real quick, pause it real quick.  Totally different style back then than he has now, by the way. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Totally different style.  Different.  Much more the Latino angle.  Much different.  Much, much influenced now by a bunch of other people, including me.  All right, go ahead.  And Comedy Composite is in 92.  And Star Search in 91.  Star Search.  Yeah.  Star Search champion in 91.  Thank you very much.  Yes.  Four stars from the judges.  So I'm just saying, hey, I won.  I won.  That's all that matters, Whitey.  Why you got to bring a beater down, dude?  Why you got to bring me...  Did you get three and a half stars?  Hey, I got the championship, bitch. 
[00:36:00]  How about that?  Why you got to...  Technicalities.  Even if no one showed up, he still won.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  That's the first clip?  That's the first clip.  Comment?  Okay.  Well, you know, whatever.  That's a one-star search.  Holy shit.  Didn't Sinbad win Star Search?  Does that really fucking mean anything?  You know, here's the point.  He's trying to justify what everybody knows.  He's a thief, and then he's a hack, and, you know, he's upset at me.  I didn't put the link on his site. 
[00:36:30]  A bunch of people found his show to be very derivative, and they were on my message board,  and they were talking about how much he sounds like me.  And they asked me about him.  I didn't want to deal with it.  You know, what do you think about Carlos?  Blah, blah, blah.  I just wrote, The Force is weak with him.  I'm being fucking nice.  That's all I was doing.  I was being nice.  By saying The Force is weak with him, that is nice, compared to what this guy really is.  He's a fucking thief.  That's all it is.  All right, so I'm just trying to avoid some bullshit.  I don't want to deal with it, man.  You know, whatever.  I'm in the middle of 50,000 fucking things. 
[00:37:00]  I write that.  I type that out.  What's that?  And then, apparently, that was it.  Well, I fucking heard enough.  So he goes on this show.  This guy's living in the thinnest walled glass house in the history of the fucking comedy world.  Ever.  I mean, this guy's got a fake fucking name, a fake ethnicity, and he's a joke thief.  There's nothing genuine about him.  And yet, this dumb motherfucker thinks he's going to get on the air in Tucson, and I'm not going to hear about it.  But thank God this guy, Frank, emails me and sends me this.  Kudos to that guy.  That guy, that's a fucking nice move. 
[00:37:30]  All right, let's go to the next clip here.  So, no, but I'm tired of it, dude, because I've been nice to that guy all the time.  And that, dude, you know, what happens is we go to the comedy store, right, where I haven't been in years.  Right.  And everybody walks around saying Joe Rogan is the man.  Right.  Right?  But they're saying that because they haven't seen me.  Right.  So then I go in there and I show them what can be done, and they walk around and go, oh, my God, everything I heard about Carlos is right.  That guy is sick. 
[00:38:00]  Like, nope, I mean, I'll walk into the comedy store, dude, after legends walk in there.  Right, right, right.  At, like, 1 o'clock in the morning in front of 12 drunk people.  Sure.  And I'll get a standing ovation.  Right.  Because I love that place.  Sure.  I mean, it just, dude, it's just, oh.  Yeah.  And then all the comics walk, that's where I got the nickname, The Punisher.  Right.  I got the nickname, The Punisher, because who was in there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, let me make this up real quick.  Oh, yeah.  First of all, nobody calls that guy The Punisher. 
[00:38:30]  They call him The Phony Mexican, or they call him Carlos Menstilio.  That's all anybody calls him.  If you go to the comedy store, that's what you hear.  Oh, dude, The Phony Mexican's here.  Or, Carlos Menstilio's here.  And what happens?  Everybody gets nervous, because Carlos sits in the back of the room with a fucking tape recorder and watches people's sets.  I had never heard of The Punisher.  Oh, yeah.  Chris Rock was on stage.  All right.  And I was with some buddies.  And they were like, man, Chris Rock is unbelievable.  They're all, like, creaming their pants over Chris Rock.  Yeah.  And I went, he's great. 
[00:39:00]  He's awesome.  And I disappeared.  And I told the guys, I want to go on after Chris.  So I went on after Chris, and I just destroyed the room.  Yeah.  And then, from that point on, all the comments, you're like, that's the guy.  That's the guy, man.  He's the one.  The Punisher right there.  That is so fucking insane.  If you knew the atmosphere of the comedy store and how much that guy is loathed, this would be hysterical.  When he shows up, everybody goes, ooh.  That's what everybody goes, this motherfucker. 
[00:39:30]  And a few guys, like, they'll open for him on the road every now and then.  It's like, hey, Carlos, what's up?  You know, they just want that $120 check every now and then, you know?  He's thinking how much Raymond Pride fucking noodles they can buy with it.  That's it.  There's no more people to talk to him.  Oh, man.  Oh, I get.  He steals other comics material.  That we've heard a lot.  Yes.  Put these rumors to rest.  We get comics that come in here and have made those comics before.  But they make them because they can't explain why I'm funnier than them.  Right, right, right. 
[00:40:00]  So whoever said that?  Is that part of Joe Rogan's shtick with you, though?  Oh, that, because didn't Joe out Dennis Leary on Howard Stern and all that?  Hold on, right, real quick.  I think that.  First of all, I outed Dennis Leary in Playboy magazine.  And then I didn't even bring it up.  Howard, someone called it up when I was on Howard.  Someone called in.  And they brought it up.  And I was like, okay, here's what happened.  And I always tell everybody that I was a Dennis Leary fan.  When I first started out doing comedy in Boston, I remember the first time I saw Leary, I was like, holy shit, this guy's fucking awesome. 
[00:40:30]  This guy's really funny.  And then I saw Hicks.  And I was like, okay, what the fuck's going on?  These guys are doing the same shit.  And then I talked to all the comics in Boston, all the old school comics, and they all said Leary's a thief.  And I was like, whoa.  I was like, well, why are they hiring him?  Well, that's just the way it goes.  I was like, holy shit.  Holy shit.  And you know what?  No one ever wanted to listen to someone who nobody knew who the guy was.  You know, when I was on news radio, and if I was running around yelling Dennis Leary's a thief, I'd be like, fuck you.  What the fuck are you?  You know, and then finally, you know, like, people knew who I was, and they asked me when I did this Playboy magazine interview, you know, what do you hate about comedy? 
[00:41:00]  What bothers me?  I'll tell you what.  I hate fucking joke thieves.  Do you want to name joke thieves?  I said, fuck it, yeah.  This is, these are the people that steal.  And I started going off about Dennis Leary, about how much it bothered me, and fucking, how much it freaked me out that this guy could just take somebody's ideas and rework them and make a career out of it.  It's fucking crazy.  Dennis Leary's first album was so similar to the Bill Hicks stuff.  It was scary.  It was scary.  It was scary.  But then you look at Locked and Loaded, the last one that he did after Bill died, and it's a fucking steaming pile of shit. 
[00:41:30]  It's awful.  Because that's Dennis' real thoughts.  That's his real creative material.  That's his real shit.  Leary on Howard Stern and all that.  I think that's what happened.  See, those guys want to put me down because they got nothing on me.  Yeah.  They got nothing on me.  So then they just throw that out there.  See, here's how I can prove it to you.  I mean, to anybody.  I don't have the time to steal other people's material if I wanted to. 
[00:42:00]  What the fuck does that mean?  What the fuck does that mean?  I don't have the time to steal material, but what, you have the time to write material, you fucking asshole?  What does that even mean?  You know what?  I don't have the time to steal material.  That is the most insane defense I've ever heard in my life.  I don't have the time to steal material.  Whoa!  Whoa!  But yet you're sitting in the back of the fucking room every time I'm on stage watching me.  My whole fucking set.  And I got it on videotape, you cocksucker. 
[00:42:30]  And it's on JoeRogan.net.  And anybody can watch.  Anybody can watch you watching me.  And me watching you bomb for about 30 seconds and leaving the room.  Get that up there.  I want to see this now.  You can watch it.  My cameraman made a whole video.  Made a whole video.  Because, keep playing.  I'll explain the whole thing.  Buddy, I don't have the time to steal other people's material if I wanted to.  Right, right.  Let's just theoretically say that I wanted to steal other people's material.  The past 10 years, I've been doing the road 50 weeks a year.  Right. 
[00:43:00]  50 weeks a year.  Because you don't have time.  I couldn't be in two places at the same time if I wanted to steal your act.  I couldn't.  So why are guys like...  Pause that for a second.  I did a one-man show in Aspen.  And this is when I hated this motherfucker.  And we had words at the Comedy Store.  And he knew I hated him.  And yet, he came in.  I was standing there waiting to go on stage in Aspen at the Comedy Festival.  He came into the room and sat down and watched my entire fucking set.  He knew I hated him.  He knew that he hated me.  And yet, he came there and he watched.  Like he does with everybody. 
[00:43:30]  He sits and he watches.  And he just cherry picks.  Just cherry picks ideas.  How can I rework that?  How can I fit that into my beaner material?  How can I fit that into this?  That's what he does.  I wanted to steal your act.  I couldn't.  So why are guys like Joe...  And secondly, they can't do my jokes.  So why are they saying that?  Oh, those jokes are so fucking hard to do.  Fuck!  Black people, fuck!  White people, fuck!  What's up, white people?  Come on, take a joke! 
[00:44:00]  Fuck!  Those jokes are so fucking hard to do.  You fucking craftsmen!  You goddamn fucking genius!  Wouldn't you compare white people to Mexicans?  That is insane!  How do you do that?  How do you rework Paul Mooney's material, take out the word nigger, and put in Mexican?  That is fucking genius!  Where do you come up with these thoughts?  Are you taking DMT?  Are you lying in an isolation tank?  Are you tripping on mushrooms?  Where are you getting this creative burst of fucking genius?  Please, tell us, oh Punisher. 
[00:44:30]  Please!  Tell us!  Hey, you fucked up, asshole!  You talked about me on the radio!  You gave me...  It's open season on phony Mexicans, you fucking piece of shit!  Sorry, carry on.  It's not just the pot of lollipop talk.  How many more Red Bulls are you going to have this morning?  That's all I need tonight.  I don't need one, dude.  That lollipop's laced with some other shit, too.  Yeah.  That's a hatred.  The lollipop's almost gone.  You know what?  This is ten years of this kind of hate, man.  I've watched this guy for ten years do this shit. 
[00:45:00]  Ten years steal from everybody, man.  So why are they saying that?  Why are they making these comics?  Because that's the only way they feel better about themselves.  That's the only way they can explain why I do better than them.  Why aren't they saying it about other comics, though?  Why do you?  Because those other comics aren't that funny.  Oh, Chris Rock.  That guy's not that funny.  That Dave Chappelle guy?  That guy fucking sucks.  Dave Attell?  What the fuck is that guy funny?  Come on.  Jim Norton?  What the fuck is that guy funny?  Bill, comment? 
[00:45:30]  Step up!  I live out here, man.  Step up!  I've never seen the dude.  It's that East Coast, West Coast thing.  No, it's one of those things.  Everything he's saying, I've heard time and time again.  But, you know, I've heard the same shit.  Robin Williams, they always say that shit about him.  But it's like, I've never seen it.  You know what the real problem is?  Yeah, they say Robin Williams is a huge thief.  I'm sure he is.  Everybody that I know that have ever seen him back in the day said he was a thief.  Steve Pearl, who's the guy who's at the comedy store all the time, said Robin stole a bunch of his shit and had to give him checks for it. 
[00:46:00]  But you know what?  None of Robin's peers ever stepped up.  None of Robin's, you know, none of those guys that were like big comics back then ever got on the radio and said, this guy's a piece of shit.  You know?  No one ever published an article in a magazine.  Nobody ever stepped up or wrote a book about it.  Nobody ever put an article on their web page.  Nobody ever stopped it.  Nobody who had the power to stop it ever stood up.  Because they don't want to distract from their own career.  They don't want to, you know, focus on, you know, the possibility they might be jealous of this person. 
[00:46:30]  They want to just, you know, do their own shit and just try to hope he doesn't steal from them.  You know?  Like Jay Leno said, oh, just write fast and then they can fucking steal.  Write fast and then.  How about kill them and bury them in the fucking woods?  Write fast and then they can steal?  I'm five minutes away from doing the rest of the show as loud as him.  I'm sorry.  Fucking Joe Rogan!  Dude, you're not.  I'm low on the energy.  Come on!  Let's go!  Fucking mad.  Because it's happened to me a bunch of times and you write something and, Bill, you can back me up on this. 
[00:47:00]  You know what it's like.  You get a bit.  Yes, I do.  Bill Burr doesn't have a network show yet, so.  Whatever!  You know, you come up with an idea.  You treat it.  You find the right way to do it.  No, Carlos is West Coast, man.  I don't.  You know what I mean?  I can't.  But it's not even him.  I'm talking about joke thieves in general.  There is a West Coast, East Coast comic thing going on.  There's no joke thieves on the East Coast, right?  No, I'm just saying that.  I would trash a guy if the dude stole one of my jokes. 
[00:47:30]  I saw him do it.  I definitely knew it.  I've heard all this shit about Carlos, but, you know, my whole career has been out here.  I don't even get half of it.  I didn't know what a fucking beaner was.  That's like when he's like, I know what you're thinking.  They finally gave a beaner a show.  And my girl looked over at me.  She goes, what's a beaner?  That's my only thing about him.  He does his act like everybody grew up right outside of San Diego.  All right, we got two more clips here.  They're short.  It's true.  You're right, actually, Frank.  It was Joe Rogan to Dennis Leary. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  And Dennis Leary actually came out and called him out on it.  Yeah.  And Joe just cowered.  Why is Joe hysterical?  You didn't cower.  By the way.  I was following that whole thing.  There was no cowering, dude.  From Dennis Leary?  Was he going to cough on me?  What the fuck's going to happen?  That's an easy one.  You could just get all the CDs and see which one was done first.  There was no cowering.  You know what, man?  You get Bill Hicks' Relentless and then I get Dennis Leary's first album and you'll see.  And I'm aware of this, yeah.  And I'm aware of this really intimately because the producer of all of Bill's albums is Bill's  best friend, Kevin Booth, who's a really good friend of mine. 
[00:48:30]  So I got straight information right from Kevin who told me exactly what Bill was going through,  how Bill was freaking out, how Bill and Dennis were friends in the clubs and he couldn't  fucking believe that Dennis was doing his shit.  And Dennis is doing shit that he did on an album.  He's doing his No Cure for Cancer thing.  He's like, this is insane.  Like, how do I stop this?  Was it just accepted back then?  No, man.  Just nobody did anything.  Nobody stepped up and said, hey, fuck you.  You know, nobody stepped up. 
[00:49:00]  Nobody stepped up.  That's what it is.  Once you get to the point, if you're putting, you know, asses in the seats, they don't care.  So it's up to you guys to kind of like police the thing.  Club owners don't give a fuck.  But what about you guys policing the thing, making it uncomfortable for these guys?  That's what I'm doing right now.  That's what I'm doing right now.  Take him to the octagon.  That's what we're doing right now.  Take him to the octagon, Joe.  Well, we're making the phony Mexican uncomfortable right now.  And I want everyone to know.  UFC rules.  Come on.  Kick some ass.  You need a lot more of your fellow comedians to step up. 
[00:49:30]  Well, you know what?  Absolutely.  You guys got to police your own.  And you know what?  He fucked up.  Because if he wasn't talking shit about me, I wouldn't be talking about him right now.  We wouldn't be talking about whatever.  Well, because we've gone after a bunch of radio shows recently.  And their excuse was, ah, everyone steals, so it's okay.  And we're finally saying, no, it's not okay.  It's just not okay.  It's not.  I heard Chuck Lydell ripping you off.  What are you going to do?  I'm going to hide.  Cover my body and curl up in the fetal position, hoping he's tired of punching me.  That animal.  But if Gilbert Godfrey ripped you off, that would be no problem, right? 
[00:50:00]  That would be a different story.  Clearly.  Joe is a tough motherfucker, man.  He actually came out and called him out on it.  Yeah.  And Joe just cowered.  Why is Joe all of a sudden determined that he's the arbiter of comedy and he's going to put everybody in check?  What's up with Joe?  Because he, I don't know, man.  It's insecurities.  It's like, look, when I go on stage, okay, this weekend, for example, I'm going on stage with 11 other comics.  Okay.  Okay.  We're doing 12,000 seats in L.A., 20,000 seats in San Jose, California. 
[00:50:30]  Right, right.  All right?  So we're doing this huge venue.  I'm telling you right now that from a competitive standpoint, I want to be the funniest guy on that stage.  I want to kick everybody's ass.  It's just like everybody in radio that does morning radio.  They want to be the funniest show, the most popular show.  Sure.  But at the end of the night, that doesn't matter.  Yeah, you're right.  Because it's all about putting the effort forth.  I think the force is with you, Carlos.  Don't listen to that Joe Rogan.  Wow, that guy's really funny. 
[00:51:00]  The guy at the end there was really funny.  I like that line.  He did.  Well, probably got a big laugh in Arizona.  So, keep going with the clip because at the end of it, this is the last clip.  You want to hear the greatest story?  Here's the greatest run-up story to that.  All right.  Joe was on stage two Fridays ago.  And then I went on after him.  Oh, boy.  And he got off stage and he was just like watching me, pacing.  And I could see him like look in the back of the room and then I'd get a huge laugh and he'd walk out. 
[00:51:30]  Then he'd come back and get a huge laugh.  Then he'd walk out.  And then I got off stage and I left.  And the next day, I got a phone call from some of the comedians.  And they're like, dude, we don't know if we fixed it, but we made him admit it.  Listen to how full of shit that sounds.  I mean, if you're someone who knows how to read people when they're lying and making things up, just replay just that.  We made him admit it. 
[00:52:00]  Listen to this.  All right.  Hold on.  I've got to do a little something here.  But we made him, we made him, we made him admit it.  What the fuck are you talking about?  You're a psychologist, too.  I love it.  They made him admit it.  They made him admit it.  What?  Admit, admit what?  Yeah, well, he'll play it again.  Oh, I will?  No, I mean, he'll say it again.  He'll say what it is.  They're like, dude, we don't know if we fixed it, but we made him, we made him, we made him admit it.  And then.  Made him admit what? 
[00:52:30]  So here's what they did.  He was talking smack about me, and they said, dude, you can say whatever you want about him, but you know what?  He doesn't steal people's material.  He's great.  And you know what?  Right.  He kills.  And you have to admit that.  You can say you hate him, you say you don't like him, but you have to admit that he kills.  And he was like, I will not admit that.  And they're like, you have to, dude.  You have to admit that he kills.  And they're like, we talked to him for an hour, and at the end of an hour, he finally said, all right, I admit it.  All right.  He said, so he said, and they quote that he said, fine, he kills. 
[00:53:00]  I don't know how he does it.  I can't explain it, but he kills.  And then they all just walked away, and I was like, yes.  I am the Punisher!  And then I whacked off.  The comedy gods shine upon thee.  That's why it gets a standing ovation.  Now, here's the beautiful thing about it.  Did you hear the hole, Anthony?  Yeah, the hole added in her. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, the hole.  Every morning show has to have a hole that has absolutely nothing.  But here's the beautiful thing about it.  What he's describing, I actually have a cameraman that follows me around at the comedy store.  Because a bunch of my buddies come to the comedy store, and a lot of times we're hanging out in the parking lot, some really funny shit happens.  And we videotape it, and I edit it, and I put it on the internet.  Well, my camera guy was there for this night, and he videotaped Carlos watching me, okay, from the back of the room, doing exactly what he claims I was doing, pacing around the room, watching me from a bunch of different angles. 
[00:54:00]  And then he also videotaped me afterwards going, dude, I just don't, what the, he's talking about nothing.  He's just saying nothing.  He's a fucking idiot.  Saying that for one minute.  That's how I talked about him.  For one minute.  That's it.  That was the whole thing.  We got all of it on videotape, all of it, including this audio, so we have his audio over the reality.  And my camera guy edited it all together with a Mexican song, and it's beautiful. 
[00:54:30]  And it's on JoeRogan.net?  Yeah, you can go watch it.  Anybody can watch it, along with a guy getting fucked to death by a horse.  That's on my website, too.  Oh, we talked about that on the show.  Isn't that beautiful?  You've got to get your XM back, man.  I know.  Well, I got it in my truck.  I just got a new car.  Is that that video clip of that guy?  Getting drilled by the horse.  Where the horse puts it in a little bit, and you're like, wow, that guy's taking a lot  of cock.  And then the horse goes, and just buries it.  Three feet of horse cock. 
[00:55:00]  I was stunned when he put it in like a foot.  Yeah.  It was like a foot of horse dick.  The guy's holding it back.  Yeah, the guy's holding it back like, just want that much, just that much is cool.  And I'm watching and going, oh my God, that guy's taking a foot of horse cock.  And then the horse just gets so excited that he goes, and just drives three and a half  feet of horse dick.  And that's it. 
[00:55:30]  It's over.  It's over.  Guy just hemorrhaged.  Backing up.  That's it.  It's a horse fuck snuff film.  It is.  Yeah.  It is.  It's a horse fuck snuff film.  It is.  We weren't brave enough to throw that video up on our sites for some reason.  What pussies?  Fuck it.  I threw that right up there.  JoeRogan.net.  Because a lot of our fans were looking for the video after we talked about it.  I got to go back slightly.  I met Joe Rogan when we were off the air.  And I got just, from a personal experience, the guy fucking kills on stage.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  And all his shit.  I've seen a lot of comedy, man.  A lot of comedy.  And his shit is so fucking original, it's not even funny.  I was blown away.  I had no idea that you did comedy, first of all.  And I had no idea you were that good at it.  And then I met him after he got off stage because, you know, he stood up for us after  we got fucked royally by Infinity Broadcasting.  Yeah.  He wrote a whole thing on his website about us.  He didn't even know us back then.  So I just walked up just to thank him for that.  And we kind of hit it off at that point.  Yeah, very cool.  Yeah, but just fucking kill. 
[00:56:30]  Are you doing comedy in New York while you're here?  No, no.  We're doing this new Fear Factor thing, Fear Factor Home Invasion, where we're showing  up at people's houses, making them do Fear Factor shit on their front lawn.  Eat this!  Yeah, we were in Queens last night.  No, I didn't even sign up for this shit.  Get out of my house, Joe Rogan.  Wait, they sign up for it in advance.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, they sign up for it.  I just want Joe breaking into people's houses and making them do shit or he'll kick their  ass.  See, that's the angle.  You just show up unexpected.  Some old grandma from Queens.  Why are you touching me?  Make her eat some shit, man. 
[00:57:00]  Stop it.  Why?  I won't eat the horses.  Take away her walker.  You could probably do that.  Come on, straight to the mailbox.  Stop making you hip.  All of a sudden, you make her bungee jump from a helicopter.  Holding her welfare check in front of her.  Come on.  At this point, they're just trying to come up with something fresh to keep it alive.  Yeah.  You know, everybody's just thinking about their mortgage.  Right on, man.  Let's keep that fucking thing moving.  There are a couple of things that I watch on there that are just amazing.  You're fucking helicopter pilots.  Are they all just these Vietnam weirdos? 
[00:57:30]  Because I've never seen helicopters flown in civilian life like that in my life.  It's so scary.  There should be rockets being shot at huts out of these fucking things.  They're right off the water.  They're right off the fucking water.  They're turning it like 80 degrees.  Rotors are just like skimming in the drink.  They're just like stunt guys.  What's really scary is sometimes they have two.  Yeah.  And the blades are like.  Yeah, yeah.  Right next to each other.  How do you know?  Yeah, how do you know?  Amazing.  Who goes up and who goes down? 
[00:58:00]  It's so scary.  I'd love to see that pitch meeting, though.  They're phenomenal.  The sixth season.  All right.  Maggots.  We did that.  Horses' ass.  Did that.  I got that.  Horses' ass.  What?  The blood's great.  Octopus twat.  No.  You got like nothing left.  Octopus twat.  Yeah, are you guys running out of shit to eat or what?  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know.  I have zero to do with it.  I just show up and go.  What is this?  What is this?  The ring to do?  Homeless.  Usually I show up so fucking high that I can't even read the script.  Usually I show up so high that I get confused at the words. 
[00:58:30]  I like look at the words and I go, wow, isn't it weird that we all agree that an H is a huss sound?  I start freaking out.  And then I have to drink like five Red Bulls and fucking level myself off.  But that's the only way I can do the show now.  I have to be baked.  If I'm not baked, I just can't deal with it.  It's just a monotony.  I'm number one.  Are you baked on camera ever?  Always.  Almost always.  If you watch that show, I am high as giraffe pussy.  Like 90% of the time. 
[00:59:00]  It's just not fun if I'm not high.  If I'm high, it's great.  It's a lot of fun.  If I'm not high, I just plow through and get the check.  All right, let's go to George.  George in Tennessee.  George, what's up?  Wow.  Hey.  Hey, man.  We're hanging with Joe Rogan today.  What do you got?  Oh, yeah.  I'm only 18, but I mean, I've watched guys like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cogby.  I mean, it's like fucking crazy.  Just to see Larry the Cable Guy go out there and make, sell millions of records or whatever 
[00:59:30]  in fucking five minutes, get on everybody else's shit.  He does other people's shit?  I've never heard that before.  Have you ever heard that before about Larry the Cable Guy?  I'm an East Coast comic.  Oh, geez.  You guys are bringing up dudes like, you know, have you heard of George the Vacuum Guy?  Have you heard of this Beaner Guy?  No, I haven't.  I haven't heard of these fucking guys.  I'm sorry.  To be fair, I mean, we had Larry the Cable Guy on.  He killed for us, and I didn't recognize any of that material. 
[01:00:00]  I saw Larry live in Montreal.  That was the only time I saw him.  It was like six or seven years ago or something like that.  And I saw original material, and I thought he was pretty funny, and he's a really nice guy.  Yeah, I don't know those fucking southern guys.  I like him.  What did you...  He's gone.  He's gone.  Let's say hi to Steve in Philly.  Go ahead, Steve.  Yeah, hey.  I want a good question for Joe.  Okay.  What happened to that guy that bobbing for rings in the blood?  Oh, that crazy dude?  Nothing.  Yeah.  No, he just... 
[01:00:30]  He always wanted to come back and do the show again, but they never let him.  But, yeah, that guy was nuts, man.  What was the story about it, guys?  We had this stunt where this guy was the last guy, okay?  And this guy was really like...  He was like one of those Tony Robbins dudes who was all positive thinking, and he was talking  about, you know, I have my goals, and I write my goals down.  And this guy was talking to himself in the side view mirror of a truck.  I'll never forget this, because I remember sitting there watching this guy talk to himself  in the side view mirror.  You are a winner.  You can do this.  And I'm sitting there watching, and I go, whoa, this guy's not that stable. 
[01:01:00]  And then I started thinking about it, and I was thinking to myself, I'm like, who's  monitoring this?  Who's making sure that these guys are okay?  And so then we're doing this stunt, and this guy goes to do this stunt, and he panics.  He gets his head in the blood, and he starts yelling, ah!  He starts freaking out, and he's, you know, he's running out of time, and he's not doing  the stunt.  He starts hitting the fucking blood and screaming.  Yeah, and blood's going all over the place.  And I'm looking around, and I'm going, okay, no one's here to protect me.  This motherfucker comes out, and he's a big guy.  He's like a big football player. 
[01:01:30]  He's like, you know, 220 pounds, big yoked up dude, and I'm like, oh, shit.  But, you know, what am I going to do if this guy just freaks out and comes after me?  Because that's a very real possibility.  That's like doing the third show without Dangerfields.  Just no fucking security.  Or prom shows.  You ever do the prom shows?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, five shows in a night?  Six shows in a night?  Yeah.  You would probably know the...  You got a 410 spot?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, those are the best.  You would probably know the Chuck Liddell story about something happened in a bar.  Some guy punched him.  Who was talking about that? 
[01:02:00]  We had him on the show the other day.  God, was it one of the...  Oh, who the hell?  Yeah, I don't remember.  But there was some story about Chuck being in a bar, and some guy just wanted to see if  he could knock him out, ran up to him, and punched him in the gut, and ran.  That's probably not true.  I wouldn't think it would be true either.  I would have heard it.  Yeah.  I definitely would have heard that.  I mean, maybe not.  Maybe Chuck just said, ah, it fucking didn't really hurt.  And what lunatic would run up to that guy and hit him?  You'd be amazed, man.  I mean, didn't you hear the stories about...  Like, Mike Tyson used to always talk about how guys would come up to him and test him when 
[01:02:30]  he was a champ.  There's crazy people out there, man.  Kind of nuts.  Can you imagine?  What's wrong with you?  There's some crazy people out there, man.  Never second guess.  There's always people crazy enough to pull off everything.  Who do you think is out there that could take Chuck down?  There's not too many guys.  I mean, look, he's lost before, but he's avenged two of his losses.  Yeah, yeah.  And the only guy that he hasn't beaten that he lost to was Quentin Jackson.  And that guy fights for the Japanese organization pride. 
[01:03:00]  The only other contender, there's two other contenders, a guy named Shogun, who is out of  Brazil, and a guy named Vandale Silva.  Those are the other two.  Maybe Ricardo Arona.  But there's not a whole lot of guys that are going to beat that guy.  I noticed the ultimate fighting kind of changed a little bit.  Like, at first, it was, you would get a kickboxer against, like, a grappler, and their two styles  against each other.  And that's pretty much all they knew.  Now everyone seems to kind of know a little bit of everything.  And I guess you have to to survive.  Yeah, I mean, some guys, I mean, still, some guys are so good at what they do that they 
[01:03:30]  can, like, Chuck almost never goes to the ground.  No, he tries to avoid being taken down to the ground, right?  And he has a ground game.  He does have a, he's very good on the ground.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  You have to have now a ground.  You can't just be a stand-up boxer now or kickboxer.  Right, right.  Because, yeah, you get on the ground with a grappler, it was over.  It was done.  You were fucking cooked.  Yeah, not anymore.  Now a lot of these guys kind of know a little bit about everything.  Everyone knows at least submission defense.  They at least know submission defense. 
[01:04:00]  And a lot of these guys, a lot of the really, really tough guys to beat are the wrestlers  who just avoid being taken down, and they learn how to strike.  They avoid being, like Chuck Liddell, he's a great striker, but he's also a great wrestler.  So instead of taking you to the ground, which he could do easily, he says,  Nah, bitch, I'm going to keep you up, and I'm going to fuck you up.  I noticed on the rematch he had with, what the hell was his name?  Randy Couture?  Yeah.  Yeah, he kept him standing up.  He kept, like, it looked like he could have fucked that guy's day up.  He was laying on the ground.  Chuck's over him.  The guy was dazed, and he punches him in the face, and then Chuck would back off. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, that's with Jeremy Horn.  Jeremy Horn, that's who it was.  Jeremy Horn.  Yeah, because, you know what, he says, look, if he goes, I mean, the logic is,  if he goes to the ground, that's Jeremy's advantage.  You know, Jeremy can protect himself.  But it looked like, to me, I don't know shit, but it looked to me,  like he could have fucking punched him three more times in the face, game over.  But Jeremy Horn is such a tough guy, and he's so crafty, and he's so,  that guy has so much experience that he might be able to weather a storm and submit him.  You know, you never know.  But if he stands up, Chuck's going to kill him. 
[01:05:00]  So that's what Chuck wants to do.  I'm with Joe on that one.  You got to fucking watch it on Spike now.  It's on Monday night.  Monday night on Spike, and then Friday night on Pay-Per-View.  It's amazing.  Who is that guy who went to, he kicked a dude in the side of the leg,  and as he brought his leg back, he completely compound, like both.  Oh, his leg was kickboxing down.  I saw that on the internet.  I don't know who that was.  It looks like a boot.  Oh, that's what I'm saying.  I saw it on the internet.  And he just goes down, and his leg bends, and he falls down.  Just pause for a moment.  Look at Donald Trump's wife. 
[01:05:30]  Holy fucking shit.  He knocked her off, too.  How did that motherfucker pull that off?  He knocked her off.  How?  He's a billionaire.  Back to the show.  When you've got names on buildings out there.  Insane.  Yeah, when you go drive by a building with your name on it.  Hey, look what I do.  A gold-plated skyscraper.  Yeah, that's mine.  When you can go and make them look up and see your name.  Insane.  Insane.  I can't do the ultimate fighting thing.  You don't like it?  You don't watch it?  It just freaks me out.  Hey, man, next Friday, if you guys want to go, it's at Mohegan Sun. 
[01:06:00]  I'll hook you guys up.  Is it Mohegan?  Mohegan Sun, I'll hook you guys up.  I've got plans for Friday.  Cage side seats.  And with love.  I can't handle that.  A lot of people ask where my line is.  My line is ultimate fighting.  When they get into those holes and just start pounding away and the guy's defenseless.  The refs have gotten much better at jumping in.  Yeah.  When it's still brutal.  Don't get me wrong.  It's still just fucking brutal.  But I remember when the guy was knocked the fuck out.  And he would still be getting five more elbows to the nose. 
[01:06:30]  That was the early shows.  Yeah, now the refs jumping in there.  That's when I was watching.  And I just couldn't sit through that.  It's different now.  It's different now.  Now it's actually much safer than boxing.  If a guy gets hit, there's no standing eight count.  There's no chance to regroup.  You go down, the guy can climb on top of you and pound you out.  Yeah.  You take less damage.  And the sport is exploding.  Well, it's the most exciting sport in the world.  It really is great to watch.  There's nothing more exciting than guys fighting.  I mean, you know that everything is at stake.  You know, their health, their pride, everything. 
[01:07:00]  It's all at stake.  They're fucking fighting.  Look, if you play basketball and a guy slam dunks a ball on you, you can always say,  Yeah, I can kick that guy's ass.  Yeah.  If a guy kicks your ass, you can't say, well, I can fucking slam dunk a basketball.  Nobody gives a shit.  It's the end-all definitive moment of all sports.  A guy kicked your ass.  That guy beat you.  Period.  There also seems to be a lot more respect for the sport by the guys, respect for each  other than in boxing, you know, which just became some kind of clusterfuck.  Plus, in every other sports, I kicked your ass is just an expression. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  This is, I kicked your ass.  I literally kicked your ass.  And just like, man, the ass-kicking some of these guys take is just brutal.  And everyone watches a fight.  We got to tell Joe about the cabbies outside the studio that day.  Oh, I love fights, man.  It doesn't matter if it's a fight on Sunset's trip the other day.  Street fight.  Oh, I love it.  I'll pull over anywhere and watch a street fight.  Yeah, just stop and watch.  Of course.  Well, that's what we all did.  We're all hanging out this window five stories up looking at these two cabbies just duking  it out on the sidewalk going at each other. 
[01:08:00]  They were such pussies.  One guy would, like, jump out.  One guy would run up to the cab that was still in his car and taunt him.  And just, you motherfucker.  You drive like a motherfucker.  And then the other guy would start getting out of his car.  And the little guy would run back to his cab.  And the big guy would shut the door again and sit in his cab.  And the little guy would run back out.  Motherfuck, you and your mother, you fuck.  And the big guy.  So they finally square off.  And I'm waiting because I'm standing there going, this little guy is just going to get  his fucking ass handed to him. 
[01:08:30]  And the big guy kind of pushed him around a little bit.  And it went back and forth.  And nothing came of it.  I was so pissed.  You want to get in there and throw one just to start it.  It was just like prying the pump.  P-Balls, you're fighting P-Balls.  Yeah, you want to see some action.  Because the one guy was pulling the other guy out of his cab at the end of it.  Yeah, yeah.  The little guy was real scrappy.  I don't like watching a guy get beat up.  Like if some guy comes after a guy and just kicks his ass.  So many of those videos online now where you can see some guy just get sucker punched. 
[01:09:00]  I don't like that.  And getting kicked in the head while he's still down.  Like that shit.  But a good street brawl couple of guys with some fucking booze in them.  And then squaring off.  That is some good shit.  It just appeals to your fucking DNA.  It's just, ooh, it's right there.  There it is, man.  That's how you knew that fucking Coliseum was packed on a nightly basis.  And it would be today as well.  It absolutely would be.  Fuck yeah.  Packed out.  Guys scalping out in front of that motherfucker.  Fuck yeah.  To just watch people chop each other up with swords. 
[01:09:30]  My fighting style is turn of the century.  Put them all.  Put them all.  Oh, you're like the gentleman Jim Corbett.  I'm going back old school, man.  That's stance.  It confuses the hell out of him.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Those Marcus of Queensberry rules.  No, that's today.  That's today?  Yeah, the pre-Marcus of Queensberry rules.  We've been at this for an hour without a break.  So I've got to get another cup of coffee.  All right.  Opus jab is the back of his wrist.  Right.  A knuckle to the nose.  You stand like the fighting Irish guy. 
[01:10:00]  Yes, the fighting Irish guy.  You're a little Dave dude.  All right.  Let me set the scene.  Joe Rogan's sitting in with us today.  Is there anything you want to accomplish?  I think I already got it out.  We should do something.  We should do something.  We'll have to fuck it up to you, though.  Anything you want, man.  We'll try to figure something out.  We've got a few more hours with Joe Rogan.  He's on his third Red Bull.  He's finished.  Zero sleep.  And the pot lollipop.  Pot lollipop.  Can you smoke the stick when you've done that?  That would be cool, right?  That would be the ultimate.  And you go to JoeRogan.net to see what he wrote about Carlos Muncie. 
[01:10:30]  And to watch a guy get fucked to death by a horse.  Yes, he spent all night riding this damn thing.  We can't get the video because everyone is slamming your website right now.  So I guess people are listening to us today.  That's very nice.  All right.  As we go to break, another friend of ours, Stephen Lynch's new CD, is out.  It's called The Craig Machine.  We're going to play Craig.  Craig Christ here.  Nice.  On the O.P. and Anthony program.  Everyone knows Jesus, the man who healed the lame. 
[01:11:00]  But I am Jesus' brother.  Craig is my name.  Jesus is the prince of peace.  Jesus is the lamb.  Jesus is the son of God. 
[01:11:30]  But Craig don't give a damn.  Because when Craig's in sight, we party all day of night.  I don't drink water into wine, but into cold-coors light.  I'm not my brother, I know.  Don't walk on H2O.  But I got hydroponic shit with me and Judas, bro.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig. 
[01:12:00]  Craig Christ.  I hang out with nephers, Barabbas and Salome.  Jesus' friends are called apostles.  Those dudes are deeply gay.  Jesus put forth miracles from Galilee to Rome.  But it would be a miracle if he brought a fucking lady home. 
[01:12:30]  Because while Jesus is praying, fucking Craig is laying.  Every lady in the Testament, you know what I'm saying.  I won't die for your sin like my famous kin.  But if you got a little sister, then there's room at this inn.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig. 
[01:13:00]  Great Christ.  Jesus was our mother's babe.  All her love to him she gave.  But there's no sibling rivalry when he's nailed to that tree.  And now the question for you is not what would Jesus do. 
[01:13:30]  But where will you be when the Craig machine comes partying through.  And if the Lord would allow, you've got to ask yourself how.  And who and why and when and where is your Messiah now.  It's fucking Craig.  Fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  I'm fucking Craig.  Craig Christ.  Craig Christ. 
[01:14:00]  Craig Christ.  I'm fucking Craig.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the Oaday virus.  We've got to get wheelchair Fred on the phone.  Yeah, we really do.  Wheelchair Fred.  He's getting all upset.  This guy was in a motorcycle accident years and years and years ago.  Really racked up his legs bad.  Didn't hurt his spine, so he's not paralyzed.  But his legs got so messed up, he didn't have health care coverage. 
[01:14:30]  So they massacred putting it back together.  He ended up in a wheelchair.  Not paralyzed, but he ended up in a wheelchair.  But his legs don't work.  His legs don't work.  And his voice box got crushed, so he's all like that.  And he sounds retarded, but he's got all his wits about him.  Fred?  Yeah, you want me?  What?  I can tell you one thing in the back door.  I liked it.  You liked it in the back door?  You liked it in the back door.  Yeah, but I feel like no more guys for me. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, no more guys for you, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sick to the dildo.  And you're stuck with the dildo, right?  You guys.  I really think you need to show people out there your plight and how desperate you really are  and what you have to do to get satisfaction.  And I think that might help your life.  How would he do that?  I'm thinking, you know, he might want to give us a little demonstration today. 
[01:15:30]  Fred, why don't you roll into the bathroom and get your dildo?  No, Vince, I've got a little more class than that.  A little more class than that.  He took one in the ass from a guy he met at the deli.  Let us know what you're doing, Fred.  It's all lubed up.  It's all lubed up.  All right, Fred.  Well, you know what to do with it now.  So go ahead.  Explain what you're doing, Fred.  Well, I'm kind of my butt now. 
[01:16:00]  You got it up there, Fred?  Yeah.  How's that feel?  It's the weirdest thing I've ever met.  He has, his voice changed.  His voice changed.  Your voice got higher, Fred.  What happened?  I'm going to hide your string now.  His voice got higher.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  This is horrible. 
[01:16:30]  We'll do the silent game to him.  So, Fred, how's it going in there?  Oh, marvelous.  I'm picking up speed nice and fast.  Make it count.  Oh, mercy, I've got nothing to lose. 
[01:17:00]  I need a girl from a bitch for me.  Are you there?  Are you guys there?  For God's sake, say something.  Well, let go.  Just get out.  It's awful shit.  So, ladies, 
[01:17:30]  come on down and do me.  For God's sake,  to me.  Okay, I don't know why I'm not going to do it.  Ladies, I'm going to go now.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  Anybody else have a hard on?  Oh, my God. 
[01:18:00]  Opie and Anthony,  the virus is spreading.  This just in,  Carlos Mencia has been booked 
[01:18:30]  on the Opie and Anthony show  next week.  Yikes.  Yikes.  Is that true, Ben?  Why don't you tell Joe Rogan  through his face  that you just booked the enemy.  Oh, that's a...  Don't do that, man.  Listen, dude.  It's going to be beautiful.  I'm just putting him in there.  I don't even have to be.  I'm just going to choke Ben out there.  Listen, I've done my work  and let him come in here  and his pale words  will fall out of his mouth  like dry bricks  and just crumple. 
[01:19:00]  This is kind of like  a Tupac, Biggie thing.  Yeah.  But both of you guys  are West Coast, though.  It's nothing like that.  This is a joke thief  and a comedian.  We've got to get you  a nickname, though, now.  Really?  Yeah, you get a nickname.  The Punisher!  Fuck!  White people!  Wow.  All right, let's try  to get a name for Joe.  All right.  I don't even know 
[01:19:30]  what to do next  because I'm just amazing  on the radio.  We've just got to  regroup a little bit.  Listen, you know what, man?  It's been coming a long time  and this stupid fuck,  it didn't even have to happen.  It wouldn't have happened  if he didn't talk about me  on this radio show.  If he didn't talk about me  on that Tucson radio show,  which he probably thought  I would never hear.  He didn't talk about me  on Opie and Anthony.  He talked about me  on something he thought  I would never hear  in fucking Tucson.  And that guy,  thank God he had some balls  and he fucking emailed me  that clip.  That was it.  He started it.  That's all I needed to hear.  Yeah.  He launched the first  Scud missile 
[01:20:00]  and I just dropped  a fucking nuclear bomb  on his head.  All right, well,  you know.  Twitch is an easy target.  It's rather large.  Fuck!  I'm sure you've realized  by now.  I had to say something  and I got nothing.  Lobbing something in there.  You're just bringing up  these obscure...  What about Larry the Cable Guy,  huh, Bill?  You ever hear that  fishing story joke before?  Get her done.  Yeah, man.  All right, we got a lot  of instant feedback coming in.  I used to say,  like, finish it up. 
[01:20:30]  And I'd keep fucking,  you know, get her done.  Bastard.  We got a lot of instant  feedback coming in.  I got to get through  some of these.  Chubsy from Jersey.  I didn't know Joe Rogan  was a comic.  I thought he was just  a game show host.  Fucking bipolar Bob Barker.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, guys.  Give Joe a golden ticket.  Yeah, we're going to save  a few more shows  from regular radio.  Ah, we already discussed  that with you.  You should be doing  a show on that.  No, I would love to.  It's just, you know what, man?  When I did The Man Show, 
[01:21:00]  when I did Fear Factor  and The Man Show  at the same time,  I had no fucking life  and I hated it  and it killed me.  And I'm so terrified  of being greedy again.  Because that's what  I did in the first one.  I got greedy.  I'm like,  I can work seven days a week.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  So we shouldn't take  our TV meeting today?  Listen.  We got a TV meeting today.  You know what?  I don't know.  You do what you got to do.  We'll see what they have to say.  It killed me, man.  But Ann and I are already like,  yeah, whatever.  We've been through this  a million fucking times.  Everyone has a great idea  to bring us to TV 
[01:21:30]  and it never pans out.  Yeah, it's a show  called Fright Factory.  You know,  people are going to be  eating like horse asses.  That's the difference  between me and others.  I'll tell you,  please rip my show off.  Please rip it off.  I don't care.  It seems like  you're looking forward  to the day  they actually cancel you.  You know what?  Because I'm looking forward  to the day  where they won't let me  be a whore anymore.  That's what it is.  It's like,  if they keep paying me,  I have to keep doing it.  It's too much fucking money.  I just stop  and I think about it.  I go, how much? 
[01:22:00]  And that's for three days.  Fuck it.  I've got to keep doing it.  My manager will go,  what do you want to do?  I'm like,  let's just keep doing it.  Yeah, go.  Let's keep going.  And I'm not saying  that I'm not thankful  and don't get me wrong.  You fucking,  you should be thankful.  I am.  I am grateful.  But realistically,  I mean,  how many times  can you watch someone  gag on animal cock  before you just don't feel  creatively fulfilled anymore?  How much money  do you have to stockpile?  It becomes that,  how much do I need? 
[01:22:30]  If I want to live  like a fucking pimp  for the rest of my life,  how much more do I need?  Just a little more.  It's always  just a little more.  Tastes just get higher  and higher.  I have a big giant  Scarface house now.  People come over my house  and they just go,  what the fuck?  My living room,  seriously,  is like a fucking museum.  It's enormous.  It's like 3,000 square feet  with marble flooring  and a big spiral marble staircase  and I have all this  art from Asia,  all these carved Thai Buddhas 
[01:23:00]  and all this crazy shit  that's just worth  shitloads of money.  And I can just buy it.  I can just go buy it.  Give me that.  Look at it and go,  all from fucking people  eating horse talk.  That's his business stuff.  That'll get you  3,000 square feet.  Right.  What are we doing wrong, Anthony?  God damn.  It's insane.  It doesn't make any sense,  but you know what, man?  Fuck it.  You know,  I use it as almost  like a little exercise.  A lot of people,  like Buddhism,  they think that  you're supposed to  not use material goods 
[01:23:30]  and not have sex  because those things  can possess you.  But I've taken  the exact opposite  and I think  you just need to make  so much fucking money  that objects  don't mean anything anymore  because you can just  go get them.  They don't mean anything.  Everything in the store  is free.  You want to go to the store?  You can just,  what do you want on TV?  You just go get that.  When nothing is special  anymore and nothing is wanted,  you yearn for nothing,  then you can truly  start looking into yourself.  Yes, for real.  And with sex,  the same thing with sex.  You know, 
[01:24:00]  I had this argument  with a monk.  I had this argument  with a monk  where he was talking to me.  I did this thing  on the man show  that was really interesting  where I pretended  that I was looking  for a religion.  I'd love to see you  talk to monk.  I did.  What the fuck  are you talking about?  No, no, no.  I'm rational, man.  I slowly, rationally talk.  I said,  do you masturbate?  He's like, no.  I go,  what do you do  with those urges?  I go,  I don't know anything.  I said,  you don't ever have sex.  No, because if you have sex,  sex controls you.  It's tying up your mind.  What if you get so much pussy  that it's no big deal?  You can just get some pussy.  You can just go get sex. 
[01:24:30]  And then it's no big deal.  Then it's just a part of life.  Then it's just a natural  human process.  Like, what about that?  He's like,  no, it possesses you.  I go,  does it?  Or are you just too fucking weak  to handle it?  Because that's what I think it is.  I think most people,  and that's the cop out.  The cop out is taking it off.  Then he said,  mother fucker,  and they started duking it out,  a monk and Joe Rogan.  It was like the old  coming hymn show.  Do, do, do.  Finished up and drank  some of that Trappist monk beer.  Choke him out with his robe.  Clearly,  it's just a nice excuse 
[01:25:00]  for me to keep doing the show.  All right,  we got more instant feedback.  Drew from North Carolina,  Joe Rogan equals joke diva.  I don't know what that one is.  Joke and joke diva.  That's Friday,  Jamaica Station.  Can Joe,  please explain how I could get  or make pot lollipops?  You know what?  I'm sure there's sites  on the internet,  you know,  just do a Google on  how to make pot lollipops.  The internet is just amazing.  It's made everything  available to people.  It's awesome.  You can buy any drugs  you want online.  People are doing that  all the time.  It's like,  oh,  I want some Vicodin. 
[01:25:30]  Don't want to go to a doctor.  Don't want to have to  come up with a reason  for a prescription.  A little of that  Canadian Vicodin gets shipped  right over to you.  And now you can get it on your fucking cell phone.  Now,  right on your phone.  I mean,  how crazy is that shit?  You can just get it on your phone.  I mean,  my phone has high speed.  It's got that EVDO from Verizon.  It's high speed internet access.  Really high speed.  Just got that,  yeah.  It's like a fucking,  it's like broadband.  It's like DSL.  It's insane.  I can watch Fox News.  I can watch Fox News live  on my phone now.  It's amazing.  Just like,  if I need info, 
[01:26:00]  info is there.  And the video's not shopping at all.  That's what the future was about  that no one ever saw.  We always thought  it was the tall,  circular buildings  with the rings around it,  the flying cars  and the Mylar fucking suits.  But it turns out,  we look,  I was just looking down the street  the other day  in front of a diner.  And I looked down the street  and I said to my chick,  I go,  this is the same fucking street  as it was in 1965.  I mean,  it's like one of those villages  in Long Island  where it's the same  old fucking building  that telephone pole's been there  for 40 fucking years. 
[01:26:30]  The street lights,  the same fucking thing.  Where's the flying car?  Where's the fucking...  Where's the jetpacks?  Where's the jetpacks?  Where's the moving sidewalks?  Where's all that bullshit  we were lied to,  never got it.  But then I start thinking,  it's like,  no,  it's about getting drugs  on your phone.  It's about saying,  I want to see a guy  getting killed  by being fucked by a horse  and in two seconds,  it's right in front  of your fucking face.  It's on your trio.  That's the future.  That was the future  we never imagined.  The future we never dreamed of. 
[01:27:00]  The future sci-fi writers  never imagined.  Spock never fucking  popped up horse cock  on his tricorder.  It was always,  what's around the corner?  What are we landing on?  It was always about information.  No matter how sick it is,  it's available  at our fingertips  in a split second.  Thank you.  I love it.  You know,  on Star Trek,  they didn't even realize  that we were going to have phones.  They thought that was too ridiculous.  They had a walkie-talkie.  It was just a walkie-talkie. 
[01:27:30]  Over.  You know,  they didn't even,  I mean,  we thought,  that's insane.  A little tiny walkie.  Meanwhile,  we're not flying to other planets.  We got a little better shit than them.  They got the flip top.  They got a radio shack.  Yeah.  Over.  And they would flip it open.  Kirk out.  And I love the fact  that sometimes  if there was interference  and he'd tap it  and go,  come on,  Scotty.  Scotty.  And turn that dial  and you'd hear like,  boo.  It's fucking analog.  Analog. 
[01:28:00]  An analog flip phone.  They hadn't even figured out  digital.  And now all that shit's  right there.  The flip phone,  you're getting live  video feeds  on your phone,  internet.  You can check your email,  man,  right there on the move,  walking down the sidewalk.  During the break,  did Steve help you out?  Yes.  Okay, good.  We should talk about that.  You had no idea.  Steve is the master.  No, he knows everything  about the web.  All right,  Steve just hooked up  Joe Rogan big time.  Tony from Whackbag.com,  I just researched  Carlos Mencia 
[01:28:30]  and what Joe Rogan said  isn't accurate.  What?  He was born Ned Mencia.  No, that's not true.  That's the internet movie database.  It's a lie.  That's not his real last name.  His last name is Wholeness.  That's not true.  He's lied to the internet  movie database.  The internet movie database,  by the way,  also says Brian Callen,  who's a very good friend of mine,  is my half-brother,  which is not true.  Really?  Yeah, that's incorrect.  It says half-brother to Joe Rogan.  That's not true.  There's a lot of shit  on the internet movie database.  It's not true.  He was born Ned Mencia  and given the name Carlos  by his aunt who took him in. 
[01:29:00]  His parents are from Mexico  and Honduras.  No.  Germany and Honduras.  Is Joe jealous  because Mind of Mencia  is actually funny?  Sure.  Absolutely.  Terribly jealous.  Here's the reason  internet movie database  shouldn't be taken seriously.  Here's for Jimmy Norton.  The Punisher.  The Punisher.  Jimmy Norton now works on  nickname,  Lil' Jimmy and Liddy.  This is from  internet movie database  about Jim Norton.  Now works on the  national radio show  Opie and Anthony, 
[01:29:30]  XM Satellite Radio,  full-time.  Describes himself  as a meaty-breasted  little nothing.  Grew up in Jersey.  He's been doing stand-up  for 15 years.  And then trivia.  Favorite song is  Karma Chameleon  by Culture Club.  Enjoyed playing the game  Monster Rain as a child.  This is all on  internet movie database.  So I think in order  to update it,  all you have to do  is register  and you as a citizen  can just put anything  you want on people's sites.  Or a rumor gets out.  Yeah.  A rumor becomes that. 
[01:30:00]  And that's that.  My friend Brian,  I always call him  my brother from  a different mother.  That's the joke,  you know?  Because he's a close friend.  And it makes it on to the...  Yeah, it's a fact.  Also, they just  released a press release,  Anthony.  XM Satellite  tops 5 million subscribers.  Oh, wait!  Whoa, big announcement.  It's official.  5 mil, huh?  5 million subscribers.  Didn't we just  announce four?  Yeah.  God damn.  Seriously, like what?  They're just getting  millions, a million people 
[01:30:30]  at a clip now.  Beginning of summer, maybe?  Yeah.  When we first signed on,  we were excited when, like,  they would announce  a couple hundred thousand  new subs.  Well, we had our choice  between the two companies.  And at the time,  XM had 2 million subscribers.  And Anthony and I were like,  wow, that's a great place  to start.  And the little doggy company  had like 50,000  or something crazy like that.  They were nowhere.  Yeah.  And now, only a year later,  we're celebrating a year  on XM, by the way.  Congratulations.  It's coming Monday.  Now it's 5 million.  Mm-hmm.  In one short year,  they did 3 million. 
[01:31:00]  You know, I can't even  listen to regular radio anymore.  I've had this,  I got a new car  and I haven't got the XM in it  and I try to listen  to regular talk radio.  It's like,  they can't even fucking swear.  No.  They can't even tell the truth.  They can't even close to swearing.  I mean, now it has nothing to do.  They can't say fart.  They can't even talk about  what they want to talk about.  Even subject matter,  they can't.  It's insane.  We were talking about our agent  and the one thing  I did remember before  I nodded off at the table  when Bob Eatman was talking.  Oh my gosh.  This guy's such a bore.  Jesus Christ.  Was the fact that  now the FCC's whole thing  is, well, 
[01:31:30]  we knew what you meant.  And they're fining people on  we knew what you meant.  Because everyone knew  what you meant.  Yeah.  No matter what kind of  code words you use,  you could say, you know,  lick her cooch  or lick her coochie.  Coochie's not a bad word.  Used in that context,  it's still not a bad word.  But they'll say,  we knew you meant cunt.  And you might as well  have said it  because now we're going to  fine you like you did.  Wow.  Do you think that  what they're trying to do  is that maybe they know  it's ridiculous  and they're just trying 
[01:32:00]  to somehow or another  scare people  and slow down  the inevitable shift  to uncensored radio?  I mean, they must know  that rationally  people are going to want that.  They must know  that if you put that out there  that people are going  to want that.  So they're just trying  so hard to suppress it  that they're going  way overboard.  It's like when we did  news radio,  I remember there was  an episode that we  wanted to say penis.  We wanted to say penis  like three times.  They said we couldn't.  So we put it in the script  like 30 times.  So we said, 
[01:32:30]  look, we'll take  20 penises out.  Do you think  they're doing that  but the opposite?  They're crushing  everything  so that, you know,  they just somehow  or another  slow down the tide.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know  what it is.  I think it's more so  just plain old politics.  The commissions  that they put in place,  the FCC,  and then the  congressional committees  that are in charge  of the FCC, 
[01:33:00]  they say,  well,  we've got to  protect the children  and the voters go,  hey, this guy's  protecting my children.  I'm going to vote for him.  You know,  that's what they're doing  because who the hell  comes up against  shit like that  as a politician?  I say we allow  the kids to hear fuck.  You know?  It sounds great  and he'd get my vote  but that guy's never,  we've talked in the past  about the fact that  New York,  the city,  used to have  bottomless dancing.  It used to have  bottomless, 
[01:33:30]  you could go to  a strip club  get a beer  and watch pussy  in front of your face  as you're drinking beer  in a strip club.  And then some politician  thought his constituency  would vote for him  if he got them  to put panties on.  But once you do that,  it's done.  It's doctrine.  There is no guy  that could go,  and I will bring back  bottomless dancing.  You know,  he's got a bunch of  degenerates  voting for him  but for the most part,  once you go over that line,  that never comes back.  We will never again 
[01:34:00]  see bottomless dancing.  I just like that  whole suggestion  that if you're drinking  and you just see titties,  you can control yourself.  You're fine.  But the second you see  a pussy,  that you're just going  to be trampling the stage.  It's over.  Because the booze,  the pussy,  so does L.A.  In L.A.  they show pussy  but if you have liquor  you can't show pussy.  Yeah.  But in Vegas  they're like,  whatever.  Whatever you want.  You're gambling  for the pussy.  It's wonderful.  The whores have billboards.  I'll come to your room  and suck your cock.  I mean,  it's a billboard,  practically.  I mean,  it practically says that. 
[01:34:30]  Gorgeous models  will come and entertain you  in your room.  In your room.  Oh!  I mean,  she's not juggling ass.  Paul.  She's not showing you  fucking car drivers.  She's entertaining.  The stripper Domino's cars  with a little horror picture  of it.  Hey,  Jack LaWayne is on TV.  Oh,  look at him.  91 years young today.  This guy's 91.  And he just proved  that he could still  lift his legs up.  Is that what he's doing?  They were doing some exercises  and basically  he was doing like  knee lifts. 
[01:35:00]  He's all upper body,  isn't he?  Celebrating 90 years  of healthy living.  Oh,  man.  Really?  And what about you,  Elaine?  He dresses like  he's going to go  work on an airplane.  The blue coverall.  No, but I do.  I work out every day.  And you know,  he just turned 91 yesterday.  Yeah,  were you out celebrating,  Elaine?  Yeah,  they just turned 91.  And I'm on my way to 80.  I can't afford it,  actually.  You rock the cradle,  Jack.  That's how I get my exercise.  Yeah, you do.  You're getting better.  Fuck.  You got some exercise.  Fucking his wife. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, let's go, Elaine.  All right.  All right.  Are we getting up or sitting?  What are we doing?  Well, Jack likes to do this one.  This is the one we do.  I need to go.  He's in the chair  doing some chair exercises.  And you folks at home,  I want you to do it, too.  This is a...  Yeah, do you want to try it?  I have to get rid of that old...  Yeah, I'm dying already, Jack.  Let's go.  It looks like we're in the movie theater.  Oh, my God.  They're lifting their legs up.  You know what, though?  91 Joe Rogan's doing it.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  This really deep-fought you. 
[01:36:00]  That gets right there.  Oh, he's touching it.  You know what, though?  How are we going to deep-fuck Joe Rogan?  I'm not feeling it.  91 years old, though?  It's crazy.  There are people in their, you know, 70s  that are drooling in nursing homes,  and this motherfucker's on TV.  Oh, you've got to give it to him, of course.  Yeah, I mean, he is keeping it up.  What do you think all those guys  that three people to the left  really wanted to do in entertainment?  Oh, actually.  Yeah, totally.  You know, they've all accepted an Oscar  in their bedroom.  Right.  Like, just fantasizing about it.  Now they're sitting there  with this fucking 90-year-old guy. 
[01:36:30]  Doing dopey exercises in their chair.  Seated aerobics.  With a tie on.  With a guy lunging in his suit.  Fucking stupid neck ornament  he's got hanging off of his...  That guy camped out  waiting for us to leave  after we fucked up.  The wife is kind of steadying him, though.  Like, just in case he...  Who's going for the juice?  Tell me about it.  I can't wait for this segment to be over.  There is no credibility left in the news.  There is nothing left in the news.  I cannot watch it anymore.  These people cannot deliver my news 
[01:37:00]  and do chair workouts like this.  It just doesn't work.  Hey, there was a big story yesterday  that we never got to.  I got the audio.  It'll just be a surprise to everybody.  All righty, Opie.  I don't think we mentioned it on the show,  so listen to this.  We're going to spend a few moments now  talking about this new study  which found that left-handed women  may be at higher risk  for early age breast cancer.  If you're left-handed and a woman,  you're at a higher risk for breast cancer.  Yes. 
[01:37:30]  That makes absolutely no sense.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  Well, if you think a little deeper  into the whole thing,  it is a hormonal thing  to be left-handed in the womb.  Joe Rogan is very high right now.  What are you thinking  when you hear something like that?  Who cares?  I don't have tits.  That's what I'm thinking.  I don't have tits.  There you go.  Joe Rogan quoted his name.  How old do chicks get  before they get breast cancer?  Let's take a listen here.  Early age breast cancer. 
[01:38:00]  Early age.  This really surprised a lot of people,  certainly around our office,  and so we wanted the bottom line  on whether lefties are at greater risk  of this and other problems,  and so we brought in  ABC News medical contributor,  Dr. David Katz.  And David, I'm inclined,  looking at this,  is to say this is silly.  I mean, it's like saying,  look, we found a statistical  correlation between people  who own parrots  and people who have cancer,  therefore parrots cause cancer.  But that could be.  It seems counterintuitive to me  that left-handers would be  at a greater risk 
[01:38:30]  for early age breast cancer.  You raise a good point, Charlie,  that sometimes these associations  that come out of studies  are not about cause and effect,  and we don't know  that that's the case here,  that this is an association  between left-handedness  and breast cancer.  But it could be possible  for a number of reasons,  one of which is  that there are genes  associated with left-handedness,  and there are genes  that raise the risk  for various cancers.  And if those genes  are neighbors  and travel together,  when you get the one,  you could get the other.  So what do you do then? 
[01:39:00]  You start becoming right-handed?  No, because it's  already predetermined.  You're just done.  Right in the womb.  Right when the sperm  digs into that egg cell,  that's it.  Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick.  There's the death clock  winding down,  and there ain't shit  you can do about it.  Isn't that the case  with everybody anyway, though?  It is.  It is.  But as far as that goes,  it's just, you know,  that DNA helix  might as well be wrapped  around your fucking throat.  It's choking you. 
[01:39:30]  It's choking you.  The slow death.  There it is.  And left-handedness  might be something that,  because it's happening  as you're being formed,  that same thing  might have an association  with breast cancer.  There you go.  I found an association  between left-handed people  and being more intelligent.  I know a lot of left-handed people  that are really fucking smart.  But that's one of those stats  that could be,  there are so many skewed,  like,  stats.  That whole thing,  I just heard driving in,  they said families  that eat dinner together, 
[01:40:00]  the kids have less instances  of drug abuse.  If you think about it,  it has nothing to do  with dinner together.  If you're a family  that's eating dinner together,  you're probably...  Raising your kids right.  Yeah, you're communicating better  and you're doing other things.  It's like,  that's the same kind of stat.  I just met in my own life,  my own personal life,  like, the people that I've met  who are left-handed  were almost always pretty clever.  Yeah.  I don't remember ever meeting  a left-handed person  who's a fucking idiot.  That's a Joe Rogan study.  I don't know. 
[01:40:30]  We've got to get on the news with this.  Do you know any left-handed idiots?  I mean, maybe there's a few.  I mean, I'm sure there must be,  but I don't recall ever meeting any.  True.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know something?  You're left-handed?  They're all kind of clever.  Yeah, but you're smart.  I'm an idiot.  Are you left-handed?  No, you're smart.  Bill Burr is smart.  Dude, you know, one day  I'll bring in my high school transcript.  Really?  Yeah.  Were you good or bad?  Awful.  Awful?  I have to have kids someday  and they ever get...  That's why you're a good comic.  If they ever get hands  on that information,  I won't be able to say shit to them.  They won't have to do anything.  You know, look at you,  you fucking... 
[01:41:00]  Look at you, Dad.  How many good comics  were good in school?  You know?  Yeah.  I mean, you're so boring.  I didn't even graduate.  High school?  No, you know this, Joe?  This is the difference.  I tried.  Oh, you did?  Oh, yeah.  I gave up.  I took all, like,  the SAT prep classes.  Ooh.  I did all that.  Ooh, you tried and stunk?  That's bad.  That's bad, Bill.  As I was doing the questions,  I would try...  Okay, I don't really know this one,  but I know it's not D,  and I would literally  try to limit it down.  I was so baffled. 
[01:41:30]  I got, like,  804 combined.  804?  Oh, combined.  Yeah, and the...  What was the highest...  Wow, that's really bad.  Wait, you got 804  in your SATs combined?  Combined, yeah.  Yeah.  I was so baffled  in high school.  The only reason  I went to college at all  was so that people  wouldn't think I was a loser.  Really?  That's all I just...  Because I remember  I took a year off  and I was telling everybody  I took a year off.  I'm taking a year off.  And you were a loser.  That's great.  You ain't going back.  I'm like, shit.  I gotta go to college.  So people don't think  I'm a loser.  But I had no intention  of ever getting a job.  I was just one of those 
[01:42:00]  poster boys  for not doing pot.  Like, I shouldn't have done it.  Because pot fucked me.  I was so good in school  growing up.  And then the second  I started smoking pot,  over, Johnny.  Over.  I would want to be stoned  all the time,  and I was.  I woke up,  I'd smoke before I even  started getting ready  for school,  to go to school.  And then I go,  and like,  like, fate would do  things to me.  I remember,  I had a test,  that it was some  big fucking deal test 
[01:42:30]  I was supposed to take.  I'm walking to school,  and I said,  I'm not smoking pot today.  I was walking to school,  and I found a nickel bag  of pot on the sidewalk,  walking to fucking school.  And of course I smoked it.  I was stoned for this  big important fucking test.  It was fate.  I had to,  and then constantly,  and then I was the guy  that was out with all my  friends smoking pot  for every period,  and I'd never realized  that they would just be out  for one period,  and I'm there for every 
[01:43:00]  single one of them.  Like,  there's my friend Joe,  and there's Frank,  but not on the same time.  I was,  I never went to any class.  They were just skipping  one class.  I'm skipping all of them  to hang out with each  and every one of them  just to smoke pot.  And my high school dean  came up to me  and actually said,  look,  you're doing nothing here.  Take the rest of the year off  and come back  and see if you could  apply yourself  because you're doing nothing.  That's a great dean.  And I was like,  yeah,  I'm off.  I started working.  Am I supposed to teach you  a lesson?  Are you kidding me?  Teach me a lesson?  I never went back. 
[01:43:30]  That was it.  I just never went back.  You're actually coming back.  That's like the classic line  right before you begin  the life of being a loser.  Yeah,  I'm just taking a year off.  A year off.  I'm just going to get  my head together.  Yeah.  A year off.  That's what I felt like.  I started working.  I had money.  Yeah.  You know,  it was nothing,  but it was more money  than I had going to school.  I was able to,  you know,  put gas in the car  and get a little Jack Daniels  and cigarettes for the weekend.  It was the perfect life.  All my friends are in school.  I'm driving around.  And I spent all my time  at the school. 
[01:44:00]  Oh,  that's the worst.  Like,  I'm hanging around  at the auto shop parking lot.  I'm kicked out,  but I'm at the school.  Doing donuts.  Smoking pot.  Hey,  I don't fucking go here anymore.  Fuck you.  Just here for the chicks.  Oh,  I remember that.  What a loser.  That's great,  though.  Some guys had graduated  like two years.  Oh,  that's the worst.  And they were still  hanging out there.  Yeah.  Whoa,  dude.  Oh,  yeah,  they got a full beard  and they come up like,  so where are the parties?  There's something 
[01:44:30]  really fucked up  about a 21-year-old  dating an 18-year-old.  It's like,  why?  Or 17,  like a high school senior  and the guy's like 20.  Got to deal with that shit.  Meanwhile,  it's only three years,  but it's a big three.  That's a huge three years.  I was out of high school.  I think I was 19  and I was going out  with a 16-year-old  and she had just turned 16.  Like,  I think I was at her  sweet 16 party.  Oh,  my God.  And her fucking father 
[01:45:00]  hated me.  Fucking hated me.  Gave me a speech once  in his work truck  of my intentions and shit.  Oh,  you got to come up  with the bullshit  because of course  you're just there to fuck.  He owes you full of shit.  Of course he does.  He's thinking,  what kind of whore  did I raise?  I think back at that now  and I'm thinking like,  God damn,  I'm like 10 years older  than he was then  and,  you know,  just if I was that guy  sitting there,  I'd have fucking,  I'd have choked me. 
[01:45:30]  I'd have fucking choked me out.  I remember I had a girlfriend  when I was 17  and she was 15  and then I turned 18  and she was 16  and there was like  some real concern  that I was going to go to jail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  because I was fucking a girl  who was underage.  You know,  I was a man  and she was a child.  But you're in a relationship  kind of for the time?  Yeah,  yeah.  Yeah,  it's a little odd,  isn't it?  Are we in trouble?  Like,  this is illegal  but,  you know.  What were you like  right before you turned 18?  Like,  sweetie, 
[01:46:00]  I got another month here.  Let's make the most of this.  I don't think I realized it.  Put a towel down.  Every week counts.  Don't worry about the period.  I'll fight through it.  There's my contribution  for the day.  There you go.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  Ladies and gentlemen,  East Coast,  represent.  All right.  We have more audio  of this left-handed thing.  Let's see what the doctor  has to say.  On its surface,  I tend to say  this has got to be silly.  And yet,  when you look at the numbers, 
[01:46:30]  the numbers indicate  from this study  that you're 2.4 times  more likely.  That seems more  than a statistical anomaly.  Well,  that's right.  And of course,  we do statistics  to say,  is this likely to be  by chance  or is this real?  On the other hand,  I don't want people  to panic about this.  Lefties have enough  to worry about.  They have to stand  on their head  to use a pair of scissors  for crying out loud.  The numbers in this study  are quite limited.  So I don't want  anybody panicking  about this.  But it could be real  and it could be  due to genetics.  It's also speculated 
[01:47:00]  that hormonal exposure  while we're developing  in the womb  may influence  which side of our brain  is dominant.  And hormonal exposure  in the womb  can also influence  the risk of breast cancer.  So it's plausible  and warrants  further investigation.  Nobody panic, however.  Oh, don't panic.  Left hand,  don't start  chopping your breasts off.  Are there other  medical distinctions  between left-handers  and right-handers?  You mentioned the scissors,  but that's just because  scissors are basically  constructed for right-handers.  But you know what?  Everything's constructed  for right-handers. 
[01:47:30]  You know,  the word sinister  comes from the Latin word  for lefty  because we tend to think  there's something  just not quite right  about lefties.  The world is designed  for right-handed people  and as a result of that,  lefties have more trauma.  They actually tend  to die earlier  because machines  are designed more  for right-handed people.  You can't use these scissors.  They tend to make  better pictures.  They do real well  in the major leagues.  And they're really dangerous  in the street fight  because that left hook  surprises you  and gets every time.  It's actually a right hook,  you fucking idiot.  It's a straight left  and a right hook, dummy.  Nobody panic. 
[01:48:00]  Exactly, thanks.  You don't throw a left hook  when your right hand's forward,  you fuckhead.  Do you think this science guy  knows anything about fighting?  He's talking about street fights.  He's talking about stupid.  You know,  when I used to scrap.  Nope.  We're going to take a break.  Right-o.  When we get back,  we have a Gulf Coast lullaby.  What is that?  I have no idea.  That is the shittiest  radio tease ever.  I have no idea  what that even is.  Some dude wrote a song  about the Katrina survivors. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, okay.  Now I'm hanging in.  They're always fun  to listen to, right?  Yes.  Every tragedy needs their songs.  Needs their songs.  Everyone,  they all think  that's going to be  their big break.  Like when a tragedy comes,  9-11 was king for this, man.  You got all these  hack musicians  writing these  sensitive America songs  thinking that,  you know,  having that dream  that that's going to be  the one that makes it big  and puts them over the top.  And we were playing them.  And they were awful.  Every country singer.  Who was the first guy  who did the red, white, and blue? 
[01:49:00]  Is that Toby Keith?  Is that that?  I'm proud to be an American.  No, good.  At least put a boot  now I'm free.  Wow.  Stop.  We're just pissing off  like the whole,  all the Midwest.  That's a good goddamn song.  Won't you shut your fucking mouth?  You goddamn shitty.  There's some guy  called somebody  a commie on here  the other day.  Yeah, called him a commie.  For what?  You fucking commie.  From his bunker.  What did you say  that he called you a commie? 
[01:49:30]  No, I can't remember  who the fuck?  He was calling  like another caller  a commie.  It's like,  do it.  Because he was bashing Bush  or something.  Yeah, it's like we're beyond  the communists at this point.  Yeah, it's like fucking  where is the terrorist era now?  You're the Al-Qaeda.  You're the Al-Qaeda  is what you are.  You evil doer supporter.  You acts as the evil  is what you are, commie.  All right, we're going to go to break  with another track  from Stephen Lynch's latest CD.  What's it called again?  It's right in front of you.  The CD's called what?  Trinkets made from guerrilla...  No, it's Jim Norton's CD.  It's Jim Norton's.  Of course, it's called 
[01:50:00]  The Craig Machine.  The Craig Machine.  Here's another track  from Stephen Lynch's latest.  Yeah.  You're either going to like this song  or kick my ass after the show.  You're the love of my life 
[01:50:30]  but it cuts like a knife  and I feel that I'm being misled  See, I'm a little concerned  before I recently learned  of the swastika tattoo on your head  It makes you smile  when you hear Sieg Heil  You love the smell  of a burning cross in the yard  You do goose-step salutes  in your Doc Marten boots  And you quoted Mein Kampf  in our fifth anniversary card  I think you're a Nazi, baby 
[01:51:00]  Are you a Nazi?  You might be a Nazi, baby  You keep extensive files  on the Nuremberg trials  And you watch them  whenever they're airing  I guess I should've known  when you bought a new bone  for your puppies  named Goebbels and Gehring  You showed up late  to our very first date 
[01:51:30]  I said, how are you?  You said, white power  Call me paranoid  But I'm not overjoyed  When you ask me if I want to shower  I think you're a Nazi  Don't be lying, baby  Are you a Nazi?  Are you anti-Zion, baby?  Every dress is monogrammed SS  You hold an Aryan picnic and bash 
[01:52:00]  And it makes me irate  When you say I look great  When I wear a little tiny mustache  Your social politics say  that races don't mix  And you call it pure blood pollution  And whenever I'm sad  You say it's not so bad  For every problem  There's a final solution  I think you're a Nazi  Give me an answer, baby  Are you a Nazi? 
[01:52:30]  You drive a fucking Panzer, baby  You say that love is blind  So how could I have guessed?  But then again I met you  At the Wagner Fest  I know you're a Nazi  And that's why I'm leaving 
[01:53:00]  I know you're a Nazi  Sure as my name is  Steven Lynch-Bergstein  Hey, this is Bob Saget  My name's fucked up  Congratulations to XM  on 5 million subscribers  Hey, Sean Hannity here  congratulating XM's satellite radio

[01:54:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:55:00]  Ow!  Thanks!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I'm...  Hey, I don't know.  I'm...  Drink a six-pack, turn off the lights, smoke some crack. 
[01:55:30]  I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore!  XM202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  There's too many men, too many people, making too many problems.  And there's not much love to go around.  Can't you see this is a land of confusion?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is the world we live in. 
[01:56:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And these are the ends we're given.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Excuse them and let's start trying.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  To make it a place worth living in.  Ah, that's Disturbed, right?  Doing Land of Confusion by Genesis.  We got Al Jorgensen of Ministry coming in.  What time?  I think around 10 o'clock or so?  10 a.m.  Al Jorgensen, lead singer of Ministry. 
[01:56:30]  Those guys have been around a long, long time.  And he wanted a bottle of wine for his appearance, so...  Oh, right.  Eric went out and got some cheap wine.  Did you get cheap wine?  Well...  Because he's, what, an aficionado, so he's probably a wine snob, right?  Yeah, supposedly he really likes his wine.  You were turning into a wine snob for a while.  Like, I remember we'd be out to dinner with Bob or someone from XM.  Oh, here comes Eric.  Here comes Eric.  To his theme music.  He's got walk-on music, Joe. 
[01:57:00]  E-Rock, how much for that bottle of wine?  About $42.  $42?  Oh, he's gonna hate it.  And what is it, Ope?  It's a gallon.  Hot box.  It's a box with a tap on the air.  That's always good.  But you can put it up on that shelf in your fridge and just kind of dump it out, out of  a little valve, the plastic valve.  It's a keg.  A keg of wine.  If it was only $42, he's gonna hate it if he likes his wine.  Absolutely.  Ah, yes. 
[01:57:30]  Chateau Mildreau.  98.  Yeah, he's not gonna like this.  If he's a rock star, he's probably getting over $100 bottles.  Yeah, the other bottles that he had listed were $100, $200.  He listed?  I'm scared that people were gonna judge me and think, you know, I'm just a good anorexic  girl.  And I'm not like that.  Body image on Tyra.  What's wrong with her?  Do you understand that you wrote a letter to me?  You wrote to me.  Your mom didn't say, oh, my daughter has such a problem and I wanted to talk.  She's upset with body image?  Yeah.  She's sitting, but I don't see any problems as yet. 
[01:58:00]  As much as you want what you think is a perfect body image, something about that's not right.  Is it?  Something about that's not right.  Tell it to Stan.  And you're here because of that, so I don't think anybody...  She's no Mari Povich.  Mari would have her in a bikini parading around the audience.  Your ass is a little fat.  She'd be eating cake by now.  If she was not Mari.  All right.  I'm definitely being thin, 15 years old.  She's probably going to get a big, fat Mexican mom.  That's probably what it is.  Yeah.  Look at her. 
[01:58:30]  I can't eat a lot.  Her mom's probably a fucking cow and she doesn't want to be like her mom.  Oh, Mexican food is brutal.  They even, like, fry the ice cream.  I'm just kidding.  You just fucking take it to a whole other level.  I love burritos, bro.  I love burritos, bro.  To be focused.  I don't see that when I'm looking at her.  I want to see how Tyra handles this situation.  I'm going to show you something right now.  A picture of me when I was your age.  I'm going to show you.  Watch this.  You say that you want to look like me and you want to be so sweet.  I saw this in the picture of her.  Do you know what my stomach looks like up under this shirt right now?  Don't do it, Tyra.  Don't do it. 
[01:59:00]  Do you know what it looks like?  Don't do it.  Why don't you touch it first?  Why don't you squeeze right here?  You squeeze that right here.  Right there.  All right.  Now we're going to show everybody what that looks like.  Look at that.  That's me.  Sometimes I have to do this to get comfortable on this couch.  Keep going.  Wow.  What a fat pig she is.  She's sitting down, hunched over, and a little bit of belly is touching her pants.  I can do that.  I can do that.  Yeah.  I can do that.  I can do that. 
[01:59:30]  I can do that.  I can do that.  I can do that.  Yeah, right?  You want to see.  You want to see this.  You want to see what it looks like.  Anyone else notice that Tyra Banks is starting to look like RuPaul?  I drew myself.  Yeah, I can do myself.  There's a little RuPaul going on there.  The kid needs better pants.  I'll say that.  Her jeans are a little weird on her ass, but she's got a big ass.  That's good, though.  I have fat legs right here.  I have blood handles.  She does not have a confident posture.  I don't have a butt.  I have stretch marks in my legs.  Whoa.  I really like wearing skirts because... 
[02:00:00]  That's how she sees herself?  Yeah.  I drew it like Frankenstein.  What is this two huge legs?  My legs.  That girl is going to be so easy to fuck.  Not even funny.  Not even funny.  Wow.  Some toothless homeless guy.  Hey, good looking.  Hey, you are so cute.  How does that little girl have stretch marks on her legs already?  She doesn't.  That's what she's saying.  Is that like a genetic thing, man?  The stretch mark thing?  Because some chicks have babies and bang. 
[02:00:30]  They just snap right back.  They snap right back.  And other girls just...  It's just a wreck.  Got stretch marks on their kneecaps.  It looks like a fucking catcher's bed.  It's gone.  Hey, speaking of which, does Britney Spears snap back?  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Over, right?  Oh, done.  Look at her chin.  Look at her chin.  She's got that frog chin.  Yep.  It's that weird sag, the skin from her...  It doesn't go back.  It goes straight from the chin, like slopes down to the neck.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a mess.  Telltale.  That whole area is a mess.  She was always, like, struggling. 
[02:01:00]  Meanwhile, what a pimp that fucking Kevin Federline guy is.  Thank God we got one.  All right?  We got one.  After all these fucking years of guys getting raped, all the Johnny Carson stories and Steven  Spielbergs, how much?  How much did he get?  We got one.  We got a fucking loser.  Some white trash piece of shit fucked a supermodel, superstar, super pop star.  And is driving around in fucking Ferraris, and he shot a live round into her pussy, and  he's got it for life.  She's stretched out and wrecked, and he's driving a fucking Ferrari. 
[02:01:30]  We got one.  We got one on our side.  We win this round.  And when does he move on?  Because now he has the fame and the money, right?  Soon.  Very soon.  He fucking wrecked her.  Very soon.  He wrecked Britney Spears.  I say he's gone within the year.  He's going to find another pop starlet.  Some other girl is going to want to be the next Britney Spears.  She's going to meet him at some fucking awards show.  Yeah.  You know, they're going to talk, and it's not really going so good with me and Britney.  You know?  Yep.  Postpartum.  He has some sort of fucked up credibility now.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's going to be a reality show. 
[02:02:00]  He must have something.  Oh, wait.  Tom Arnold.  We had one, too.  But Tom Arnold fucked a fat chick.  It doesn't really count, right?  We didn't really win that one.  Yeah.  He kind of lost.  Yeah.  It's not worth it.  Other people have talked about this, though, but how he's a lifer now.  Yeah.  The guy, like, managed to parlay that into an actual career.  Yeah.  He made it through.  He made it through.  It is possible.  Can I interrupt for a second?  Eric's waiting to leave.  Eric, thank you.  Oh, Eric.  So the wine hopefully will be good enough for Al Jorgensen when he comes in a little  later of ministry.  Could it be the worst music ever? 
[02:02:30]  Walk on.  Walk out music ever?  I say yes.  I can't think of much that could be worse.  Fantastic.  That would even suck when that song was a hit.  Right.  Yeah.  When it was a hit, you don't want to walk into that.  No, it's the best part of that bit.  He hates it, but he's being a good sport.  He actually waited for us to acknowledge that he's going to now leave so we can play the  music.  So everyone's got a nice laugh.  That walk on music just has to end stopping, kneeling, and having a dick in your mouth.  That's how the walk ends with that music. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, the worst.  All right.  We've got to get Steven here because he got an email from this guy, Les Llewellyn, Llewellyn,  something.  I don't know.  And it reads, please consider playing a new song about Katrina survivors on your station  or posting a link on your website by the band Dixie Lizard.  Huh?  What?  You should really take the time to listen to the song that I wrote in honor of all of  those affected on the Gulf Coast.  It's a serious song?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I love the serious ones.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that one of my favorites of all time was Remembering Lacey, the Lacey Peterson 
[02:03:30]  tribute song?  Some guy actually fucking wrote a song about Lacey Peterson, and we couldn't keep a straight  face.  Had Connor being dead in the whole thing.  Oh, here comes Steve.  Oh, hey, Steve.  Perfect.  Thank you.  You're getting very good at landing that thing.  Are you enjoying the show with Joe Rogan today?  I certainly am.  And Bill Byrne?  Joe's great.  And this guy's good, too.  This guy.  He's always a prick. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, you had a story about hybrids?  You still mad about that big A car?  Yeah.  I am.  Yeah.  Quickly.  Steve has a hybrid car.  He's got the Prius.  Is that the one you own?  Yeah.  And it runs on gas and electric.  Sounds like a muscle car.  It really is.  It really is.  It really is.  Yeah, right.  And he's tattooed arm hanging out the side.  It's saving him all kinds of money, he says.  I like it.  But there was a survey that came out.  Some economists and stuff got together and crunched some numbers, Steve.  And what I'm seeing here is hybrid cars, they run about $3,800 more than their regular counterpart. 
[02:04:30]  So the new technology costs more.  So most of them cost a little more than what you would spend for a comparable car.  $3,800 more is what they're saying.  Sure.  Who did this study?  Yeah.  This study was done by Edmunds.com.  The partners at Edmunds.com.  I guess they're a survey place. 
[02:05:00]  What do I know?  It seems legit.  They have a website.  You could go there and see a horse fucker guy to death.  Wait, I think Edmunds is the company that does the blue book, or is that something else?  Could be.  That would give him more credibility, wouldn't he?  Well, anyway, $3,800 more.  Let's see.  Hybrid, including purchase, maintenance, insurance costs over five years, assuming 15,000 miles of driving per year. 
[02:05:30]  You'll make up the cost in gasoline money if the price of gas immediately goes up to $9.20 a gallon.  He's praying for hurricanes now.  Yeah, exactly.  No, well, for sure.  And for the entire five-year period.  It has to stay at $9.20 a gallon for you to have made money or saved money by getting a hybrid vehicle.  However, and I think that's true in some realm.  However, the Prius doesn't have a non-hybrid counterpart.  That doesn't really.  That's not taking into account, or is it the tax incentives, the $3,400 or $3,500 tax incentives that the government gives you for buying? 
[02:06:00]  How about the pleasure of going over 35 miles an hour?  Isn't that worth a buck or two?  My hybrid goes plenty fast.  Thank you very much.  Like a soapbox car.  It's going to be at the top of a hill with his dad cheering him on.  A little rascals episode.  Got a cat and a puppy in the front on a conveyor belt. 
[02:06:30]  I like my hybrid.  I really do.  You've got a boxing glove on an accordion so you can punch people in the head as you drive by them, Steve.  But it's also not taking into account if you trade in another car and get a hybrid.  I mean, yeah, I'm sure those economics do work.  And, you know, I'm no friggin' economist.  I have no idea.  But if you trade in a car and get, say, 15 or 20 on a trade-in and only wind up coughing up another two on a hybrid,  I'm sure it's going to pay for itself pretty quickly. 
[02:07:00]  It's a relative, though, because you could use the same trade-in to get the comparable regular good car.  Okay, fine.  I read some weird shit online where there's some scientists that actually believe that oil is not a fossil fuel.  It's not from dead dinosaurs.  Really?  They believe it's some part of a natural process that occurs underneath the Earth's surface.  And, like, it'll keep happening?  Yeah, it'll keep happening.  I like that guy.  Yeah.  There's a book out.  I just ordered the book from Amazon.com.  I haven't read it yet.  But if anybody knows about that, call in.  Because, apparently, it's like an actual theory that scientists are considering. 
[02:07:30]  The guy who did it is, like, I think he's a professor at Columbia or some, like, legitimate university.  Evans.com?  But, I mean, how crazy would that be if they found out that oil isn't, you know, a finite resource?  On the other end of the spectrum, I get emails all the time from people that say we're completely running out of oil.  There's none left under the ground.  It's all a big lie.  And, I don't know, I can't imagine that even if that is the case and down the road, whether it's 50 or 100 years down the road, that we run out of oil, that it's just going to be, well, that's it. 
[02:08:00]  Use your laptops as doorstops because we're done.  You know, don't you think there are alternative fuel sources out there, but we're really not going to start working on them until you go up to the gas pump and a drop comes out and you go, hey, what the fuck?  Yeah.  There's nothing left.  You handle everything like a term paper.  Right.  Last minute.  Why work on it now when I could go to the gas pump?  And then we'll go to those big windmills.  Right.  Y2K was the same thing.  We didn't deal with that until, like, September of 1990. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, remember?  People were like, fuck!  Dude, you've got to stop writing this thing.  Exactly.  You've got to think, the oil companies already have established what technology they're going to embrace once oil gets prohibitively expensive, which it isn't yet.  No.  I'm sure the technology exists, but alternative energies in terms of hydrogen or solar power just don't exist in the amounts that we'd need them to.  And it's not viable to make whatever you need to turn this into energy right now because there's oil and it's cheaper.  It always works out to be cheaper than alternative fuel sources. 
[02:09:00]  At the moment, it's cheaper.  And it's not that oil's going to run out, like, as in, you're just going to start pumping a dry well.  Yeah, you think we're really going to run out?  No, it's not going to run out.  It's just the amount of cheap oil.  The amount of cheap oil that's going to be accessible and realistic for people to produce plastics and fertilizer and gasoline is going to run out within the next 50 years.  Is that true?  I don't buy that.  If you do a Google search on peak oil, the actual stuff that you'll read will scare the shit out of you.  I think there's so much oil down there.  You just got to find it. 
[02:09:30]  But here's the question.  This is this guy's point that wrote this book.  It was like, besides the scientific points, like, logically, it was like, how many dead dinosaurs are there?  And why are they at the bottom of the ocean?  You know, why are they in these weird spots?  They all die together?  Yeah, what is that?  Is that real?  I think dinosaurs are used as like the, you know, it was dinosaurs, but it was actually all the living shit that was going on back then.  But big ones.  If it's covered up long enough with enough heat and pressure, you know, you get fuel. 
[02:10:00]  But it's just a matter of finding it.  Like I said, Alaska, packed with it.  Is it really?  Yeah, but we just get like, you know, you can't drill in Alaska.  It's pure.  It's pristine.  And all these environmentalists say you can't really drill there in quantity.  But believe me, you run out of gas?  Right.  Fucking dump it in Alaska.  Let's start fucking pumping.  Speaking of Alaska, have you guys seen Grizzly Man?  Yes.  We talk about it all the time.  How fucking awesome is that movie?  That's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life. 
[02:10:30]  I cried laughing through that movie.  Dude, I got scared because I thought you really liked it for what it was supposed to be about.  Why didn't they fucking play it?  I saw it twice.  It was awesome.  I brought this movie to the show.  You guys haven't seen it yet.  Why didn't they play the audio of him getting eaten at the end of it?  Oh, that guy was a pussy.  The guy who made the documentary didn't realize he was making a comedy.  It's a fucking documentary.  You've got to go there in the end.  You've got to play the audio of him getting eaten alive.  It's a comedy.  It's a comedy.  It's a fucking genius comedy. 
[02:11:00]  That's what it is.  He's like, I love you.  I love you.  Meanwhile, this bear is just looking for some fucking food.  They're ignoring him.  He doesn't give a fuck about that guy.  Yeah.  It was just a matter of time that they ate him.  It was suicide by bear.  Definitely.  That guy wanted to go.  Thank you.  That's what I said on the show.  Oh, that's what I said right when I got out of there.  It was suicide by bear.  He understood the bears he was usually around, and then he decided to stay later when all  these other bears took over for the bears he knew all about.  When they were in hibernation.  And the reason why I think it was suicide by bear, the guy was an attention-seeking whore,  man.  And he wasn't getting the attention anymore.  He wasn't getting the spots on David Letterman and all that. 
[02:11:30]  It was like, fuck, man.  I'm doing this year after year and no one cares anymore.  I've got to do something big here.  And plus, the guy was...  And he hated his fucking life.  Yeah, he hated his life.  He was gay, obviously.  I was going to say that, too.  Obviously gay and in denial about it.  And how about the one time when he's like, I don't know, my girls don't like me.  I don't know, my girls don't like me.  And I'm like, yeah, maybe because you live in the fucking woods with scary monsters.  Right.  You know, and you're gay.  You know, those are two things that chicks generally like to avoid.  How about you start by talking like a man and they might like you a little better.  I was like, you know, one of your friends called you up and said, hey, I want to set 
[02:12:00]  you up with this guy.  He's gay and he lives in the woods with scary monsters.  He lives with bears and he has a lisp.  I walked out of the theater saying that guy wanted to kill himself.  How about when he...  And this is the way he wanted to go out and just be...  Just bigger than life, man.  Totally.  Yeah, he even said that, that in his death, that it would serve more, that people would  pay attention to his work, you know.  Why was the camera on at that moment, too, you know?  Oh, yeah.  But the fucking...  The audio.  The guy that filmed the damn thing, he doesn't play the audio.  And he told the lady to destroy it.  Destroy it.  We said that yesterday, I think, on the show. 
[02:12:30]  Because someone said, well, eventually that audio will be out there.  No, the guy made one of his fake girlfriends listen to it.  Yeah, maybe she didn't listen, though.  Maybe we could get her.  And then you saw the reaction on her face, so it was horrific, obviously.  Yeah.  And then the guy's like...  He hands it back to her and goes, you really should destroy this.  I'm sitting there in my seat like, are you fucking kidding me?  Because they teased throughout the whole movie, they might play the audio, but I knew damn  well there's no way they were going there.  Right off the bat.  Yeah, I had heard before.  That's why I didn't see it.  Oh, it's so worth seeing.  It's so good. 
[02:13:00]  No, but I didn't want to listen to some guy getting mauled to death by a bear.  I think those people go on the internet and watch, like, a terrorist saw somebody's head  off.  Oh, I can't watch those.  You see it?  I'm like, no.  Can't watch them.  That's another thing I refuse to do.  I have not watched those.  Steve watches them.  Ultimate Fighting.  And then Jimmy Norton watches them.  That's a big leap between Ultimate Fight.  You're going to tap it out.  I understand.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking Noggin chopped off with a saw.  The guy pulls the knife out, you just tap his leg.  All right, we can't chop his head off.  Ben watches it once a week.  The same video.  Yeah, Ben is another sicko.  He'll start it up, and I'm like, see ya. 
[02:13:30]  I'm out.  I'm out.  That's so disturbing.  Did you watch March of the Penguins?  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw that.  All right.  But the only thing I like about that is when the leopard seals come out and just start  jacking penguins, dude.  Those monsters.  Those things are monsters.  Those leopard seals.  Yeah.  They're like intelligent seals that are carnivores, and they go chase it.  Not what we think of seals.  We think of seals as like, you know, happy.  Yeah, they throw on a beach ball.  These are fucking monsters, man.  These are predators that live in the Antarctic.  It's so funny because we have this really distorted perception of so many animals that 
[02:14:00]  live in the Antarctic, like polar bears.  What would you do for a Klondike?  Polar bears are fucking vicious monsters.  They're the most vicious mammals known to man.  You know, polar bears actively target humans, like at birth.  Like, they come out of the room.  They're like the alien.  Like, ah!  My friend Kevin is a veterinarian, and he told me that polar bears, they would go through  Eskimo villages, and they put their fucking paw over their nose so that they can't see  them in the snow.  They figured out that they can cover the dot, the black dot of their nose, and they can 
[02:14:30]  like creep up on the Eskimos better.  They're a vicious motherfucker.  They also have, like, absolutely no fear of man.  Like, some animals would be like, whoa, what the fuck is going on here?  No, no, no.  They just look at you and start running at you as you try to get back to the Jeep.  Yeah, but all they see is Eskimos.  Are you scared of an Eskimo when you see them?  Well, even if it doesn't matter, they don't give a fuck.  Everything up there is food.  How much of a bitch is that black dot?  I never thought about that.  Well, they hunt for seals the same way. 
[02:15:00]  They hunt for seals.  They lean out over the ice islands, those little ice islands, and they put their paw over the nose  and boom, just jack a seal and throw them over their head.  They had to, like, learn that, though.  How much of a bitch was it at first, Sean?  This fucking dot on my face.  How'd they figure it out?  And I got this fucking dot on my face.  How did one bear tell the bear?  Dude, we got it.  I saw you.  I saw you coming.  There's a crazy story that I read once about these guys that are on an ice cutter, and  the ice cutter sprung a leak, and they had to get off of it, and they called for help. 
[02:15:30]  And they climbed onto an ice island, and while they were waiting on this ice island,  they saw a polar bear, like, out in the distance, and they're like, shit, how much time do we  have before help comes?  And help is supposed to be there in, like, a couple hours, and the polar bear just started  getting closer, like, looking at them, checking them out, diving into the water, swims over  to the next shelf, and then hops in there and looks at them, and he got closer, and  then finally he was right next to them on the next ice island, dove into the water,  climbed up, just grabbed the first guy, just grabbed him, ripped him apart, pulled 
[02:16:00]  him into the water, swam back over to the other shelf, and ate him in front of those  guys.  And then help came.  Oh, man.  Help came.  They fired a gun at it.  The bear jumped in the water, and they ate one of them.  But these guys had to watch as their buddy got eaten right in front of them.  That's pretty goddamn brutal, man.  He was eaten by a gigantic fucking monster.  And there's nothing you can do about it.  Nothing.  What are you going to do?  Hoping that the bear, like, chews 30 times before it's swallowed.  All right.  Yeah, you got to think, all right, I feel bad.  He's dead and all, but I hope it takes him a while. 
[02:16:30]  Think of some of the shit that we're scared of.  You know, you think of, like, horror movies like The Werewolf or A Vampire.  That's not shit compared to a fucking polar bear.  Yeah.  And polar bears are real.  Fuck a werewolf.  Like, grrrr.  You know, running down the street chasing you.  These are real monsters.  And you got some shit you could defend yourself against, vampires and werewolves.  You know, you got the silver bullet, the cross, you know, you hold a cross up to a fucking  bear, he might pick his teeth with it later.  And you got a gun, you better have a fucking big gun.  Yeah.  A .38?  That's not going to work, dude.  Those bullets just go in them. 
[02:17:00]  And they're fine.  And he's got a little more time to eat you before maybe he gets hurt.  So scary.  There's so many animals like that.  Like, you know, like, everyone's always, like, you know, like, searching for Bigfoot  and shit.  Well, if they found Bigfoot, what is it?  It's another fucking gorilla thing.  Like, what?  It doesn't even kill anybody.  No.  That we just didn't discover yet.  That's all that is.  If crocodiles didn't exist, you know how fucking scary crocodiles would be if it was in a movie?  Always.  There's an animal that can hold its breath underwater for hours.  It doesn't have to eat for a fucking year.  They can lie motionless under 10 inches of water for hours and just wait for something 
[02:17:30]  to walk by and they jump up and grab it.  All the patients in the world.  An alligator or a crocodile are one of those things that, yeah, if it didn't exist, it would  be just like dinosaurs.  Like, you can't picture a dinosaur walking around the earth.  You know, and if a croc didn't exist, you'd feel the same way.  But there was a time, but they're real.  You take it for granted, you're like, it's there, but it truly is, ah!  And they kill people every year.  Every year.  Oh, brutal.  Well, what were people thinking before they actually discovered the crocs?  You know what I mean?  Yeah, when they saw it the first time. 
[02:18:00]  It was another Bigfoot out there.  That's all that was.  It was another creature that we don't know about.  It's something that gets beaten in front of it.  Dude, what the fuck was that?  What the fuck was that?  Yeah, someone has to discover this shit.  First time you went to Florida.  Before then, you're like, what the hell was that?  You're thinking it's some kind of alien creature.  There's some crazy shit that they haven't even discovered yet.  You know, just recently they found a new species of chimpanzee in the Congo.  A gigantic chimpanzee that's over six feet tall.  Really?  It's called the Bondo ape.  The locals have two different names for chimpanzees.  They have what they call the tree beaters and the lion killers. 
[02:18:30]  And the lion killers are these gigantic chimpanzees.  They're like six feet tall.  They get to be like 400 pounds.  They sleep on the ground because they don't give a fuck.  They don't have to sleep in trees.  You know, people like your building, like when you, we all come from chimpanzees, obviously.  And we, people, we always have our master bedroom upstairs.  And that's from our chimpanzee heritage.  That's what that's from.  We stay upstairs to protect ourselves.  The high ground, yeah.  Yeah, just like chimps do.  They sleep in trees to protect themselves from predators.  These other chimps are so badass, they nest on the ground. 
[02:19:00]  They're fucking loked.  They kill lions.  Like the locals that live in the Congo say these things kill fucking lions.  Could you imagine a chimp?  Holy shit.  A chimp that's not four feet tall, but a chimp that's six foot tall, 400 pounds,  is just a giant, and they walk upright.  That's the crazy thing.  If you look at online, look up a giant mystery ape.  It's called the Bondo ape.  It's in a part of the Congo called Beely.  Kind of hard to get him into those coveralls and smoking a cigarette.  Yeah.  It's not happening.  Hard to get him in that little BJ in the air. 
[02:19:30]  I mean, there's a, there's a photo.  There's a guy named Carl Amon, who is a wildlife photographer from Switzerland,  who's dedicated a huge chunk of his life tracking down this gigantic chimpanzee.  And he's got all these photographs of it.  And one of the crazy things about it is the thing stands upright.  It doesn't walk with its feet outward, and it doesn't walk with its, like,  its back parallel to the ground.  It walks upright.  And it's, like, got long arms, and it's, it's a fucking freaky looking giant chimp.  God damn.  They have a photograph of one that they shot and killed, too. 
[02:20:00]  And it's, like, next to these two guys, and they're standing next to him,  and it just dwarfs them.  It's fucking enormous.  Is it a new picture of one of those old-time adventure?  No, it's new color.  They have one of those, too, though.  I love when they have those old guys.  Here's where I bagged a dinosaur.  It's, like, some guy in a pith helmet, black and white picture,  and holds something up.  A safari helmet.  Yeah, a safari helmet.  Could be a monkey, could be a fish.  They do have an old photograph.  Shredded from some huge fucking elephant gun he shot him with.  They have an old photograph of one that they believe is a Bondo ape 
[02:20:30]  that was from, like, 1920.  And they always thought this was just some freaky gorilla that someone killed.  But now they believe it's this gigantic chimpanzee.  God damn.  And they're, like, they're holding it.  Two guys are holding it up, and it's bigger than both of them.  And it's a chimp.  It's a huge chimp.  Why did it take so long to discover this thing?  Because the Congo is insane.  The Congo is, like, first of all, the Congo's only been around for 2,000 years.  I mean, the Congo is one of the weirdest parts of the world  because it's one of the rare places where you can see evolution happening right now.  There's an animal called the diker that's an antelope that swims underwater. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, that's the chimp.  You got a picture of balls on this motherfucker.  Yeah, see, that fucking thing is standing up?  No, that's real, bro.  That's a camera trap.  Wow.  See, the other one?  That's the other one is the one that they killed.  That's a guy from Seattle in the backyard.  Yeah.  But in the Congo, there's an animal called a diker,  which is an antelope that swims underwater.  For 100 yards, you can swim underwater, and it eats fish.  It's a fucking antelope.  Because what happened was the Congo used to be grasslands,  but the climate changed, and all of a sudden it became a rainforest,  and all these plains animals like rhinos and elephants,  they all got trapped in this fucking forest, and they had to adapt. 
[02:21:30]  And they're adapting right now.  And you can see it.  There's all kinds of crazy shit.  Like there's fish that come out of fucking water  and walk on land to the next water.  I mean, that's evolution.  That's what we supposedly did, right?  People came out of the ocean.  They walked on land.  You can fucking see that in the Congo.  It's happening right now.  It was Adam and Eve.  Adam and Eve.  And it's only happening over the last 2,000 years.  Eve's made Adam eat the apple.  I ain't no thing as evolution.  You're going to start smoking pot again, man.  I thought it was the lollipops. 
[02:22:00]  I'm convinced.  Maybe you're watching Discovery Channel with the lollipops.  It's getting a little twisted view of things.  Oh, dude.  It's a cocktail of things.  He's having too much fun with his life.  Joe's half asleep.  He's watching one show on the Congo,  and then it switched into a show on evolution.  He put them both together with a pot lollipop.  And that was like revisionist Rogan history.  Dude, I swear to God.  I want to get Joe Rogan.  Fucking pterodactyl and Orville and Wilbur Wright  strapped themselves to this fucking thing.  I want to get Joe Rogan basic cable. 
[02:22:30]  Whatever channel he's watching.  Dude, they got these fucking snakes, right?  They can fly.  Right?  They fucking coil up, and it's like a helicopter.  And they fucking land on you.  Bam!  On Rogan cable.  We got to go to Josh in D.C.  Josh, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Yeah.  Without due respect, Joe,  how the fuck do you know all this stuff?  I swear.  Do you want to do Discovery Channel 24 hours a day?  Dude, I got the cushiest job ever.  Fear Factor is a part-time job, literally.  I work three days a week. 
[02:23:00]  I don't even work eight hours a day.  And I smoke pounds of weed.  Dude, seriously.  I smoke the shit that the government drops off in the ghetto  to keep the black man down.  I love eating, you watch the TV, and you learn all this stuff.  You watch a lot of Discovery.  Yeah, I watch a lot of, uh, a lot, but I also read a lot.  I just, I get fascinated by weird subjects,  like a lot of animal shit,  because I'm just fascinated by humans in general,  and the fact that humans are mostly animals.  It's like, people don't want to admit  that people came from monkeys,  but meanwhile, they've mapped the human genome.  We're 99% fucking chimpanzee. 
[02:23:30]  Like, at what percentage do we have to admit  we're a fucking monkey?  Does it have to be 100?  I mean, if you ate a sandwich,  it was 99% shit and 1% ham.  Would you call it a ham sandwich?  You know?  We're fucking monkeys, man!  And it's just fascinating that we color ourselves  with cultural traditions and language  and all this bullshit,  when at the bottom line,  we're really just a complicated form of bacteria.  All right, hold on.  It's no different than any other animal.  Allison from Florida is going to challenge you.  Allison, go ahead.  Yeah, I'm a primatologist, 
[02:24:00]  so there's no such thing as a mondo age.  You're a fucking idiot.  Go online and look it up.  You're a what?  What do you do?  It's a new discovery.  You're a primatologist?  Well, look it up.  You're not current.  Pay attention.  Go online and look it up.  Yeah, this is true.  Yeah, you've learned some shit from Carl.  When did you graduate?  I have a PhD from 2000.  When did you graduate?  When?  From 2000.  Yeah, when was the last time you got online  and researched primates?  Have you ever looked at any of the new discoveries?  Have you looked at any of the Carl Amon's work? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, I've been...  What are you laughing at?  Why are you laughing?  Why are you laughing?  I'll tell you why you're laughing,  because you don't have a point.  So you're trying to...  Oh, you're ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  I have a PhD.  Meanwhile, there's all sorts of photographs  of this primate,  this gigantic chimpanzee.  Not only that,  it's on National Geographic, stupid.  Nationalgeographic.com.  CNN.com, stupid.  No, no, no, no, no.  There's bones.  There's tissue samples.  There's hair.  There's fecal matter.  There's all sorts of different things.  Now, they've mapped the DNA  of this animal already. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, please.  What do you mean, oh, please, stupid?  You haven't paid attention to it at all.  These are legitimate scientists  and primatologists  that are in the Congo  studying this thing.  And you don't know.  Yet you're calling up.  You've done zero research on this.  You haven't looked into it at all.  You're telling me we know  all the animals that are in the world?  Are you telling me  we know all the animals  in this gigantic,  several thousand mile long,  intense rainforest?  We've mapped that out.  There's another fake chimpanzee out there.  No, it's not a fake, stupid.  It's not a fake. 
[02:25:30]  Listen, they have skulls.  Listen to me.  They have skulls.  They have hair.  They have fecal samples.  They have photographs.  They have a dead one.  Okay?  Yeah.  Bye.  Some fringe scientists.  Not fringe.  CNN.  Okay?  National Geographic.  All these different  legitimate scientific resources.  Go look it up.  Bye.  You'd like to prove that,  wouldn't you?  Get your name  in the National Geographic.  Silly.  Listen to her.  Oh. 
[02:26:00]  I have a PhD.  I mean, why do people argue  about something  that they haven't looked into at all?  Why wouldn't she,  as a primatologist,  go, whoa, for real?  Let me look into that.  Holy shit.  Well, that makes sense.  I mean, how could they possibly  know all the primates?  I mean, couldn't there possibly  be another one?  But, yeah.  Where was she from?  Florida.  Florida.  Somewhere in Florida there.  She's dumb enough to live  where hurricanes hit her.  All right, listen.  We're going to take another break.  Right.  We're going to play the  tribute song for the victims  of Hurricane Katrina  when we get back.  I want to hear that. 
[02:26:30]  I'm a primatologist.  Those are fringe sites.  National Geographic  is a fucking fringe site.  CNN is a fucking fringe site.  It angers me about people.  They think that they know  without even looking into it.  That is insane.  Oh.  And with that,  we'll continue.  Fringe.  I have a vagina.  Breaking news  across the XM nation.  XM now has  five million subscribers.  This is Larry King.  Congratulations, 
[02:27:00]  XM,  on your latest headline.  Hey, this is Dick Cabot.  And congratulations  to XM  on five million subscribers.  I don't believe it.  Hey, this is Robert Kelly.  XM,  I want to say congratulations  on five million subscribers.  That's a lot of fucking subscribers.  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys  and the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy  that has everyone  jumping for joy. 
[02:27:30]  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock  is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend  you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock  comes dressed in a colorful party hat  and party blower,  making it the centerpiece  of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that,  the O&A Party Rock  is...  is... 
[02:28:00]  It's a fucking rock,  you dildo.  We've got a quick request.  Let me go to Tom.  Tom, go ahead, man.  Hello?  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, I think Rogan's 
[02:28:30]  mildly amusing today,  but could he stop yelling  in the microphone?  I get excited, dude.  Joe does it.  We're getting a few of those.  I'm sorry.  No, the only thing  I would say is  with regular radio,  they have a lot of processing,  but for some reason  they haven't figured that out  with satellite radio,  so it goes right through people.  Nathaniel's been roadie  in the volume, right?  Yeah, we're trying.  You're doing a good job, Joe.  Just enough with the yelling, partner.  I'm sorry, dude.  I love you, though, Joe.  He's going to start whispering  for the rest of the show now.  No, I'm not.  I'm going to forget. 
[02:29:00]  I'm going to be excited.  I'm going to forget.  Jackie.  Hi.  Actually, I want you to yell more now.  I love annoying people.  Go ahead, Jackie.  Hi, is this Opie?  Everybody, what's up?  Hi.  I guess Tom made the same comment,  but I just wanted Joe  to stop yelling  just because he's talking louder  doesn't mean he's coming off.  Why did you stay on the line  after he said it?  He's already said it.  Yeah, all right.  Well, I'm sorry.  That's okay.  That's okay.  We're going to calm down a little bit.  I'm just curious.  We're loving Joe Rogan today.  She sounded like she's part  of an abusive relationship.  I just want you to stop yelling. 
[02:29:30]  You know what?  She didn't get defensive.  I said, why'd you call it?  She goes, oh, I'm sorry.  Don't wreck our buzz.  We're having a great time  with Joe Rogan today.  I get loud.  I know.  If I didn't know me,  I would think I was a dick.  Are we promoting anything?  I keep forgetting.  No, no.  Just fear factor, bud.  You just can't wait to be canceled.  I'm at the Comedy Connection  in Boston this weekend.  Fuck, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why?  I'm thinking road trip, maybe.  Come on, motherfucker.  I'm thinking road trip.  Bastard.  I haven't been in Boston in a while.  We're going to have fun.  All right. 
[02:30:00]  You're going to be kind of crazy.  I'm up in somewhere up there.  Where the hell am I at?  Massachusetts?  No, I'm not Pittsfield.  I'm way the hell out of it.  Oh.  Well, I could do Pittsfield  and then go to Boston.  First time I ever fucked a black chick.  I was thinking.  Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Pittsfield?  Oh, she was dark.  I would drive into Boston.  Dark like a Bondo ape.  It was one of the weirdest  fucking experiences I ever had.  This girl was so black.  It was the first black girl  I ever had sex with.  And I was really white  because I was living in Boston  and the fucking sun never shines  and it's always freezing.  And I was at a Jay's Comedy Club  in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  And I was like 21 or something like that, 
[02:30:30]  22, and I picked up this black chick.  She had a smoking body,  but she was so black.  And we were having sex  by the light of the television  in this fucking shitty little hotel room  that I'm playing.  And I remember I'm having sex  and I'm looking down at her body.  I'm like, this is crazy.  Like, she's so dark.  I can't even see her.  It was so weird.  It was just, I was hot.  But at the same time,  I was like, wow, she's so black.  It was weird.  And my sperm, I remember my lower shot,  I would bare back  and shot on her back.  You had to, right?  Right.  And I shot on her back.  You had to.  All the white on her back.  I'm like, this is,  I wish I had a picture of that. 
[02:31:00]  So crazy.  It was the strangest thing.  You know, you'd get used  to fucking white chicks  and all of a sudden...  On her back or on her ass?  Oh, her ass or back.  Yeah.  Fucking spree.  You'd have to.  It was everywhere.  I was so excited.  You'd have to.  Brown sugar, baby.  Like, get a girl  that is the color  of flat black paint.  Plus she was...  Just like black  and then it's got to be  on the ass.  She was like  Wesley Snipes black, man.  She was black, dude.  She was black.  It was crazy. 
[02:31:30]  It was great.  Hey, can we get Steve  back in here?  We want to do this Katrina song.  Ant, we found the  Remembering Lacey song  you were talking about.  Oh, I love that one.  We started this,  I don't know,  40 minutes ago,  but basically every tragedy  someone has to make a song about.  No matter how big  or how small.  And then the Lacey Peterson  and the little unborn  Connor Peterson  and it's just an opportunity  for these musicians.  Of course it is.  That's all it is.  They don't really care.  Do you think this guy  really cares?  Oh, he does not. 
[02:32:00]  Wait.  Oh, wait.  He's looking for clearance.  He's looking right there, Steve.  You could land right there.  You love the bill.  There you go.  Bring it down.  All right, go.  Very good.  How much?  A half a thimble full  that used?  Not even, right?  Not even a half a thimble full.  That is so fuel efficient.  I know it is.  I love it.  What's up with this song?  It's terrible.  Is it really?  I tried listening to it  all the way through  in the office  and Ben just,  can you turn that off please?  It's awful.  Can you read the first paragraph 
[02:32:30]  of the email you received?  Again, Ben watches  and listens to people  getting their heads  sawn off.  Yeah.  And he couldn't listen  to this.  He told Steve  to shut it off.  fucking Ben, Ben.  Go ahead, Steve.  This email came in  late last night  and it says,  please consider playing  new song about Katrina survivors  on your station  or posting a link  on your website  by the band Dixie Lizard.  You should really take  the time to listen  to the song that I wrote  in honor of all those  affected on the Gulf Coast.  I have friends,  family, and loved ones 
[02:33:00]  who have lost everything  as a result.  Being a singer-songwriter,  I took it upon myself  to sing my prayer  to the survivors.  It's like the little  drummer boy.  He had nothing to give  but he could give  like his song  and his music.  Man.  Ugh.  Yuck.  I play the bass guitar,  the keyboard,  and sing on this very simple  but hard-hitting song.  Hard-hitting.  Hard-hitting.  Oh, this is gonna be...  I'm already...  We haven't listened  to this yet.  I'm gonna love it.  It's of no cost  to anyone  and I just want to share  my prayer of hope  with all concerned. 
[02:33:30]  I would appreciate  you possibly linking  on the song  for all your readers  to hear.  Oh, we will.  It'll be prominently displayed  there on Foundry Music.  Oh, we will.  I'm also happy  to mail you a link  so you can play it  on your show.  And it should be fun.  And then go down here.  I also have a direct link.  I also have a direct link  to the Red Cross  there so that listeners  can donate to them  if they feel the urge  to do so.  They still got a problem  down there?  I thought everything  was fine.  Solved.  They were doing stories  from gas stations.  Everything's gotta be cool.  All profits from the song  go to the survivors 
[02:34:00]  or is this going  in this guy's bank account?  I would hope  no money goes  in his bank account.  I hope it's one  of those songs  where you can maybe  play that  what is he trying  to rhyme with.  Yeah, can we do  the rhyming game  with this?  Keep your hands  on the pause button  because we like  when he goes in  and it's so easy  to like  and they gave  with their blood  and you know  the next word  is flood  because it's  so contrived  just no creativity.  I make no money  from this  and it is  from my heart.  Please give it a listen 
[02:34:30]  and if you have comments  please write me back  so I can add them  to my website.  That's all I have.  Post that email up, baby.  Plenty of comments.  Unload the pests.  See, Joe even  Release the hounds.  Release the hounds.  Release the kraken.  The kraken.  Oh, I totally  that was erased  from my memory.  I mean,  from Jason the Argonauts  what was it,  like 1981  or 79 
[02:35:00]  or something?  That was an evil  motherfucker.  The kraken.  Clash of the Titans.  Clash of the Titans.  Oh, I thought it was  Joe's been completely  rocking for us  this morning  but he stepped it up  a notch in the last hour  when I heard him  starting to chew down  on the lollipop.  I wish I had another one.  He gave up  on the licking crap.  The problem is  my tolerance  is so fucking high.  Yeah.  My tolerance is so high  because I'm high every day  and I give pot  to my friends  and they're like,  how strong is it?  Eh, it's kind of strong  and they're like,  I can't move.  I'm like,  oh shit, I forgot.  How many licks  does it take  to get stoned  from a pot lollipop? 
[02:35:30]  One, two, 12,  16.  And then one big laugh.  People are watching me.  Alright, here we go.  Here's the song from...  People are watching me.  Here's the song  from...  Stop looking at me.  I'm going to die someday.  Shit.  Here's the song  from Dixie Lizard.  Wow.  Wow.  Is this the funeral music?  It's like the movie  that was played  when Godzilla was 
[02:36:00]  like stomping through Tokyo  in the original Godzilla movie.  We're here  watching Tokyo burn.  Remember that?  It was like the voiceover  of the American guy.  Yeah.  Like Godzilla  was a Japanese movie,  obviously,  and then to play it off  in America,  they added in these clips  of this American guy.  Oh, what's his name?  Fuck.  Can't remember his name.  Shit.  Man, look it up.  And they just  like added him in  so they could have  like a star.  Oh, he'll have an answer, though.  Yeah, Stan will get it.  And it was him  like talking over 
[02:36:30]  the destruction.  It was this exact music  in the background.  I was thinking  it was the music  when they talk about  pollution on TV.  It was Ironside.  Who played Ironside?  Raymond Burr.  Oh, it was Raymond Burr.  Yeah, it was Raymond Burr.  Yeah, Raymond Burr.  Very good, though.  Wow.  That's Uncle Raymond  to you?  No.  No.  No relation.  No.  Bastard.  This is like  when they're showing  the destruction of Earth.  Yeah.  The smokestacks  and the pollution.  Awful stuff.  Gamera.  Gamera.  How great 
[02:37:00]  with those fucking movies.  Watched as a kid.  Always watched.  Every single one.  The best.  Godzilla vs. the smog monster.  I can see  the streams  and numbers  rising up  to face  face  the storm. 
[02:37:30]  This is insane.  That's the worst song ever.  There was a flood  that  covered up  the people  and they went up  to their roofs  but then  What's horrid?  Crash test dummies.  Crash test dummies.  Wow.  Sean Penn  came  They needed  to get a kayak  and break it  through the walls  but  He changed his direction 
[02:38:00]  in the middle of the song.  What the hell?  What song is this?  Uh oh.  Crash test dummies.  What's wrong with you?  Alright, who fucked that up?  Derek or Ben?  Sounds like Sheena Easton.  Yeah, what was that crap?  Yeah, you know,  Nathaniel's got it.  You got it, fam?  Yeah.  Yeah, you remember.  Yeah, this is their 
[02:38:30]  one-hit wonder.  Yeah.  Once  there was this kid  got into  an accident  and brought  a couple  school  but  when  he finally  gave  back  his  hair  had turned  from black  into bright  and white  He said  that it was  from  when  the cousins 
[02:39:00]  smashed  so  Now Charles Nelson  Riley's part  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Once  there was  this girl  who  wouldn't go  and change  with the girls  in the jeans  We get it 
[02:39:30]  This guy's ripping  off crash test  dummies  Hello  Exactly  Alright back to  the sad song  about the victims  of Hurricane  Katrina  The street  Hey  Giener  Rock  White people  White people  did not keep  caught in the  Oregon  Chase the storm  Uh oh  Chase the storm

[02:50:30]  man you got screwed  it's insane  I can't believe people are still doing it  I mean  look I know  you know  women all want it  because they all want to be locked down  and they all think the same thing  they all think  you know  I'm getting old  not all of them  obviously  I know there's some women that don't want this  some women that don't want to be married  some women that are independent  but you know  the women that want to get married  they all think the same thing  they think they're running out of time  like no one's going to want them  when they get older  that's the big  I don't want to be the 50 year old woman at the bar  like Jesus  yeah so they got to get locked into a lower rate 
[02:51:00]  or something  it's the same deal  you know  I don't know what's going to happen in the future here  so  I'm going to lock it in now  my friend Eddie is the best  this girl said to him  she goes  what do you want to do when you're old  you want to be alone  he goes  I'd rather be alone  than to be locked up with some bitch  I don't even want to fuck anymore  wow  like whoa  you see some of those  those older couples  I saw one on  on cops the other day  and it was just classic  they couldn't stop yelling at each other  while the cops were in there  and they were in separate rooms  and the cops are trying to be rational  but they're like 
[02:51:30]  they're both in their  like 70's  I think it was  and the cops are trying to say  look  we don't want to come back here tonight  we don't want to take either one of you out  you stay in this room  you're both blaming each other  for nagging the other one  so you stay here  and don't talk to him  you stay here  and don't talk to her  and everything will be fine  for the night  we won't have to come back  and the guy has to go like  yeah but she's just a bitch  he won't stop yelling  they cannot for a second  they can't help them  and you know  that is constant  but that's all they got 
[02:52:00]  it is 24 hours a day  that's all they have  that's exciting for them  that's their life  that's their life  they have no other options  they're too fucking stupid  to have a real life  they're going to go into  separate rooms  and read a book or something  no  they can't  still understand why  people can't just enjoy  each other's company  if you don't like each other  just break up  why does everybody have  to make it permanent  and why do they have  to suffer through the fucking  the pain of it sucking  it got to the point  where they just  their entire lives together  you know I'm sure  you know  hey doll  you want to dance  at some point 
[02:52:30]  it was so fucking hot  for them  they were fucking  they're dancing  they're making out  in time square  under the Jap surrender sign  how does it turn into  this fucking bitch  won't leave me alone  for a second  and this guy  is going to die  with her yelling  at his dead fucking body  and that's it  you want to trip  the life fantastic doll  no  fast forward  alright listen  we got Al Jorgensen 
[02:53:00]  outside after the break  we're going to  have him join the party today  lead singer of ministry  obviously  but Eric came in here  to remind us  that Joe Rogan  brought one of the greatest  things to our  satellite radio show  remember  for Dank's effect  holy shit  I've got to put that  up on my website  I keep saying  and you know what  I don't think we've played this  since we've been off the premium  so a lot of people  have not heard this thing  this is the most awful thing  you've got to play  is it  how many songs do we have  there's like five songs 
[02:53:30]  because the one  is the guy  that falls in love with him  yeah he wants it  he wants it  is probably the worst one  on the desk  yeah we'll play a little of this  is this worse than the  horse cock thing  oh yeah  this is the audio  audio wise  this is a hardcore  gangster rapper  who's gay  yeah  that's what it is  and I used to do a joke  about a hardcore gangster rapper  who's gay  like in 1989  so did I  what the fuck man  fuck  but I used to think  it was a bad joke 
[02:54:00]  and I stopped doing it  once I got a real act  but it was like  my idea was like  that rappers always brag  about how many chicks they fuck  like  it would be funny  if there's a gay rapper  that would brag about  how many dudes he fuck  but there really is  this guy's real  this guy's a real guy  he's doing it  he's living it  right now  and this tape  the CD  just came  I mean  there's a total chance  nobody's ever heard of this before  and this guy  somehow or another  produced this  and a buddy of mine  was selling t-shirts  my friend Dimitri  he always comes up  with these weird scams  to make money  and one of the scams 
[02:54:30]  whoa  things are falling apart  shit is falling apart  he was selling t-shirts  and one of them  was strap on tools  and he was selling it  at a gay parade  to a lot of lesbians  these t-shirts  and this guy came up to him  and hit on him  and the guy said  he's like  look man I'm straight  I'm just here selling t-shirts  he goes  well hey man I'm a rapper  check out my shit  and he had this  gangsta fag CD  and he was scared to listen to it  and he goes  you listen to it  oh man  and I held on to it  for a long time  and this is where  it gets really crazy  the one time I listened to it 
[02:55:00]  a buddy of mine  is a jiu-jitsu instructor  my friend Eddie  and he wrote a book  on strangling people  on jiu-jitsu  right  so but you know  it looks  jiu-jitsu  if you don't know  what's going on  it looks kind of gay  and when we're making this book  we're doing all these photographs  of all these different techniques  so it's two guys  bare chested  with shorts on  and you know  they're like hugging each other  and choking each other  and we're taking photographs of it  and it felt dirty  alright  it just felt funny 
[02:55:30]  and I'm like  dude I'm gonna put on  the gangsta fag CD  so I put on  the gangsta fag CD  while this is going on  this is the first time we had ever heard it  we were like  this is fucking crazy  so while this is going on  we're in my garage  which is where I have a four car garage  and two of the car garages  of course you do  is set up for jiu-jitsu  it's all mats  and kickboxing bags  and stuff  and we're there  and the other two doors are open  and the guy who cleans my pool  is walking through  and he's walking  into my backyard  and he wants it 
[02:56:00]  this guy's talking about  fucking dick  and I'm not in his face  and we're there  wrestling  with no shirts on  and there's a guy  taking pictures  and there's like  the whole thing  is like the bad  wood paneling  on the walls  and it looks like  some fucking  weird gay porn  you gotta get that  you gotta get that video  up on your website  man  we don't have a video  we just have photos  oh you gotta redo it  it's a book  redo it  get a video of that  this fucking is terrible  we were crying  and plus we were stoned  out of our fucking mind  so it made it even more silly 
[02:56:30]  yeah so Joe Rogan  did the show with us  in Vegas  when we messed  with Ed Asner  and you handed over  this to us  and we came back  to New York  and played it  but why don't we  play it again  He Wants It  by Gangsta Fag  we might have to  stop this  in the middle  yeah  yeah  yeah  this is real  that's the best part  about it 
[02:57:00]  see I was getting high  with my boys one day  just kicking back  hanging out in LA  when this dude drove by  in this really funky band  I could tell right away  this motherfucker had things  was a white dude  about 30 something  kept staring at me  yelling like he wanted something  he called me over  and he asked for directions  I saw his dick was hard  so I beat this card  I said you dying  you know you ain't lost  you wanna suck my dick  while I'm jacking you off  I got a wife and a kid  and I'm very very straight  so I said take my number  and my name  you can call me up 
[02:57:30]  when you're sick  of playing games  as I walked away  yo I knew he would call  cause if you see  one bag  they can see them all  in what universe  is that happening  Santa Monica Boulevard  where some white guy  is straight  and he's got a family  and he pulls over  to some big black guy  and wants to have  some kind of sex with him  Atlanta  is that where  I think there's probably  a lot of guys like that  with families  that are undercover  when I was down in Atlanta  they  I was on that  what the hell  the Chappelle show tour 
[02:58:00]  you know all these black girls  were showing up  and going  god look at these girls  these girls are gorgeous  and this dude was saying  you gotta be careful down here  cause they have all those  what are they  down low brothers down here  where they have girlfriends  and they're out fucking around  so there was kind of a high  HIV thing  kind of going around  that's a great thing  just to put out there  about Atlanta  so come to Atlanta  no tsunamis  but a lot of AIDS  gotta get that on a poster  alright here we go  back to Gangsta Fag  that's like when you 
[02:58:30]  spot your first  undercover hooker  in Las Vegas  and all of a sudden  you just see the whole scene  oh yeah  there's a hooker  there's a hooker  he's from Wisconsin  saying the same thing  about gay guys  and he finally called  he said his founder's home  for a week or two  and he was really bored  and needed something to do  so I drove to his crib  up in Beverly Hills  a bomb ass house  worth a couple of minutes  he said he was a gay  he just wanted to chat 
[02:59:00]  and a half hour later  he's massaging my back  in his wife's home  he gave me some hair  when in the next room  fucked on his kids bed  fucked that we fucked  like bitches in here  I can't move the space  and all over the sheets  until when I started  getting sore  I grabbed a kid's toy  and I wiped my dick off  my favorite line  my wife just took off  on his kid's toy  Jimmy Jakes is suggesting  this should be Eric's 
[02:59:30]  walk-in music  cause if you seen one back  then y'all seen him all  the thing was so good  that he just couldn't pass up  so hold that whip  yeah I'm tearing that ass up  cause he left to ride him  and he left to suck him  and after I was done  I let my homeboys fuck him  that punk ass calls me everyday  I told him we were through  then he said he would pay  so now twice a week  I'm getting paid to tackle  he laced me with the cash  and the visa platinum  one month later  and the cash out the bag  cause this motherfucker  started dressing in drag  but I did my thing 
[03:00:00]  and I had my fun with him  oh it's time to cut him off  because I'm done with him  crying like a bitch  and he's starting to beg  he's falling on the ground  holding on to my leg  screaming don't leave  please twist it G  but this is what you get  when you fuck with me  he's not very nice of him  he's mean  yeah a mean fag  that's sensitive  cause if you seen one fag  he looks like the guy loves him  and you know  he's ditching him like that  there's another one  an anti-gay bashing one  run from the faggots  that's a good one  where all the faggots  come and beat a guy up 
[03:00:30]  for gay bashing  oh this is his message  that was his wife  I gather  that's an actress  doing his voiceover  hmm  devil  for think of the storm  oh  the holy  twister  twister  twister  please  please  i miss you  i miss you  fucking  doc  i miss you  fucking  doc  està  Don't fucking tell me.  Please, please. 
[03:01:00]  Fucking call me.  Don't fucking tell me.  Please, please.  Please, please.  Um, Mr. Preston, this is Mr. Ken, Mr. Penny.  I just want to know, why are my toys sticky?  And my shoes, they keep sticking to me.  Why?  Why are my toys sticky?  Sounds like Michael Jackson.  Yeah, it does, doesn't it?  Sorry.  Yeah, really.  You know, I didn't think you could bring it over the top with that song, but at the 
[03:01:30]  end, he brings it over the top when he has to have the message from the little kid saying  his toy is sticky.  There it is, gangster fag.  Brutal.  All right, we're going to take a break and get Al Jorgensen of Ministry in here.  He's drinking his bottle of wine, man.  Got to find out if he's out of a paper cup.  This is one Elvis show.  He's going to do a cover, a speed metal cover of that last one.  We've got Bill Burr sitting in for Jimmy Norton.  We've got Joe Rogan from Fear Factor.  And Al Jorgensen joins the party next. 
[03:02:00]  Stay there.  Hi, everybody.  It's Pat O'Brien.  And congratulations to XM on 5 million.  Hey, this is Jeff Norris.  Congratulations to XM on 5 million subscribers.  Hi, I'm Rafael Palmeiro of the Baltimore Orioles.  Congratulations, XM on 5 million subscribers.  The virus is inside us.  OAVirus.com  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.

[03:02:30]  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from whores, you're dumping Norton's belly.  The only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly.  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.

[03:03:00]  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  This is murder music, man. 
[03:03:30]  You just have to kill people with this.  I love it.  It rocks!  Let's get Al Jorgensen in here.  Yeah.  He's a legend.  We are just some no-class motherfuckers in here.  We go out and get a bottle of wine.  And can't even get like one nice wine glass to have around here.  He's drinking it out of one of the Starbucks cups.  Starbucks I ever had.  Yeah.  Best Starbucks I ever had.  I was saying though, we're some no-class motherfuckers.  We should have had some wine glasses or something. 
[03:04:00]  You know those cheesy corporate parties you go to where they have those snap-together wine  glasses, those plastic ones?  Even one of those would have been better than a Starbucks cup.  I think it kind of ruins the wine when you pour it in that wax-coated cup.  He doesn't give a shit.  Look at him.  Nah.  Oh, let me get your mic on.  There you go.  Hey, Al.  Welcome to Satellite Radio, buddy.  Pinkies up.  Pinkies up.  Pinkies.  How's the wine?  It was 40 bucks.  Not good enough.  Hawk pulled it out of his ass.  Pretty good?  Then good enough.  Not bad?  Yeah, it's not bad. 
[03:04:30]  You like it?  I can't pronounce it, but it's not bad.  Yeah, try to pronounce that.  Oh, Breton, Larry, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier, Gaudier.  Whatever works for you.  That's what it is.  You were a wine aficionado?  Is that what people are saying?  I used to be until I got here today, man.  Ah, see?  We don't fuck.  What do we know?  We suck.  Dude, he's got you beat over here.  What was he got?  Red Bull?  No, fuck the Red Bull.  He's been eating pot lollipops.  Pot lollipops. 
[03:05:00]  That's Joe Rogan from Fear Factor, by the way.  What's up, dude?  And that's Bill Burr, a very funny guy to you right there.  Uh-oh.  Some kind of...  Good Joe.  I'm just watching Joe on TV.  It's some poor broad hanging from a landing gear of an airplane.  Yeah, Fear Factor's on right now.  How is this legal?  How is it even legal?  Do you remember doing this one, Joe?  Vaguely?  Vaguely.  Joe, I don't know.  There's something in an airplane.  I was probably thinking about Pluto or something while this was going on.  There you are, man. 
[03:05:30]  Ooh, what a nice shirt.  Wearing a nice burgundy shirt.  You look all concerned.  You look all concerned.  With big tits on.  Very concerned.  What are you yelling into with some earpiece in her ear?  No, she can't hear me.  Nah.  Nah, nah.  You just snap below it.  Look at the eye up there.  That is really high up, man.  Yeah, yeah.  3,000 feet or something.  That's some scary shit.  Do you have a contingency plan for people dying?  Have you guys talked about what if someone died?  I think what they're going to do is if somebody dies, they're going to gun everybody down and  blame it on the terrorists.  Is that it?  Don't let the terrorists take away your fear factor.  With new host, Adam Carollo. 
[03:06:00]  Wait, I don't know.  Very good.  I don't know.  How do you think Nicole and Stephanie are going to do?  I'm going to be shocked if they do it.  It's hard.  All right.  It's nice meeting you.  Take it easy.  Good night.  Bye, guys.  Take care, Tiffany.  I'm going to sit home.  You're a little stoned.  You're just psyched now.  You're good.  People are left and I'm out of here.  I like the walk of shame.  Yeah, the walk of shame.  Just get the fuck out of here, you failure.  So dumb.  He hates doing that show. 
[03:06:30]  Come on.  Who wouldn't want this show, though?  But he's so serious.  It's like he says.  You go on.  Everyone else has to do the work.  Everyone else is climbing around on aircraft and being dropped into vats of dog shit.  I'll show some Corey now.  I can do a handstand for like 30 seconds.  Say it, baby.  Come on.  Yeah.  Damn.  I used to make my sister do handstands and nightgowns.  My sister's friends.  That's pretty badass.  Wonderful.  And my sister.  You ready?  Yeah.  Go take some ass.  I'm betting on you. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  I can't say that anymore, by the way.  Why?  I can't say kick ass anymore.  Can't say that.  They told you not to say kick ass.  Not only that, they told me I can't say hell anymore.  I can't say, all right, let's get the hell out of here.  You can't say hell.  Are you kidding?  No, no, no.  The lowest rung on the bad word food chain.  That is the lowest rung.  Yeah.  Hell?  An imaginary world where the bad guy lives in a land of fire.  You can't fucking say that anymore.  How fucking stupid are people?  You can't say hell anymore.  Whoa!  That's like the only progress we've made in regards to religion is that if you bring up 
[03:07:30]  the devil, people think you're fucking crazy.  You can talk about God all you want.  You know, the president can talk about God on television.  But if you ever got on TV and said, we found Satan in Afghanistan and we're tracking him  by radar, you'd be like, okay, what the fuck?  Satan's bad.  Right, but if there's a God, there's got to be a Satan, right?  Doesn't it work like that?  They never talk about it.  What about cock and pussy?  Those are two different things you could...  You can't say, right?  I don't think if you can't say hell, I'd be willing to say cock and pussy on Fear Factor  out of the question.  You know, you have cats on Fear Factor? 
[03:08:00]  Cocks or roosters and pussy is a cat, right?  Yeah, I don't think that...  You know that wooden flies?  You can't hold up a dead cat and Joe Rogan will say, you have to eat this pussy to get  through to the next level.  I don't see it happening.  That's got to be legal.  Yeah, to paddle the cock, which is this rooster in a cage here.  Eat the pussy to paddle the cock.  You're afraid of the cock, are you?  Afraid of the cock, little lady?  My kid's Fear Factor?  A bunch of people want to say hi to Al.  Let's go to Tim in Illinois. 
[03:08:30]  Go away!  What's up, Tim?  Al, I used to love eating lots of acid and listening to your music back in the day.  Me too.  Eating lots of acid.  Thanks, dude.  I ain't got shit else to say.  Punch it out.  Wow.  Wow.  That's all you had?  Well, that was pretty enlightening.  A lot of people give you big respect there, Al.  Ministry was the single most important influence in the sound and concept of Nine Inch Nails.  Trent Reznor, 2005.  He said that?  Hell yeah. 
[03:09:00]  What a pussy cuck.  Hell.  Hell.  Hell.  And Scott Ian from Anthrax said, I'm not a religious man, but I've been a faithful follower  and member of Al's ministry for over 20 years.  He's got that right.  He's not a religious man.  I know that.  Well, you've been around a long time.  What do you think of today's music?  I think I'm getting pretty old.  Is that it?  I'm like, what, 69, 70 years old now or some shit?  Hold it up.  25 years.  That's gross, man. 
[03:09:30]  25 years.  My liver is pissed.  I've been in this music business that long, man.  Do you listen to anything new?  No.  No?  You don't like it all?  I really do hate it.  Really?  I watch Fear Factor and wait for them to say cock and pussy.  That about takes up my whole night.  You'll never get a straight answer.  We've got two people in the studio that hate what they're doing.  Right?  But it pays well.  Oh, that's funny.  But it pays well.  No, he obviously does it.  What is it? 
[03:10:00]  Your chat there.  I thought I saw a Blue Oyster Cult thing going on there.  That is a Blue Oyster Cult thing going on.  That shows you again.  I mean, that was like, what, 1931 when they were big or something?  They got me through the war, the big one.  The big one.  He's got hermits, hermits across his back.  This guy's going to be around forever.  A lot of people giving you legendary status, saying you're a fucking legend.  Uh-oh.  That's not, I don't know how good a thing that is in rock music. 
[03:10:30]  Well, it gets me out of some speeding tickets.  Does it?  Other than that, it's not really worth much.  Yeah.  What do you do yourself these days, touring?  Not yet.  No?  No.  Recording?  It's the big one coming up.  The big one's coming up?  We got Revolting Cox opening for ministry on this tour, which is going to probably require  an oxygen tank for me when I'm done doing both shows, right?  Come out in a walker for ministry, I think, but...  You can't be that old.  I'm getting there, dude.  Yeah? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I'm 46.  My liver's about 91.  Yeah.  It gets a little bit hard for the second show.  Live the life the whole time you've been...  You just have to pump a bunch of Viagra before each show.  I don't think you need a hard-on.  I could just get a cucumber.  Half of the sandwich.  It gets in the way of the guitar.  He's playing it so far from his life.  Hey, wait a second.  If you play your guitar over your cock, you're not a guitar player.  You've got to be able to hang it down over your cock, so you've got to wear your guitars 
[03:11:30]  low.  I hate those guys that wear the high-waistband golf pants and then wear their guitars up  higher like those old jazz cats.  That's disgusting.  That's like back in the 60s, the early 60s, the English guys were way up high like that.  Exactly.  George Harrison was way up high like that.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Yeah.  You've got to wear a sling like a gun singer.  That's what he died from.  It's like high guitar disease.  Is that it?  Yeah.  He gave a tumor when he was being up so close to his chest.  Let's go to Rev on Wack Bag.  Rev, what's up?  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to ask Al if he got any shit from anyone on the religious right for 
[03:12:00]  nicknaming himself Al-Qaeda for a while there.  Oh.  Did you call yourself Al-Qaeda?  I was Al-Qaeda, then I was Al-Jazeera, and I've been Al-Lots of things.  Alchemy, aluminum, alcohol, you name it.  So, I mean, that was just a little phase.  Yeah?  Yeah, I got shit from the right.  I mean, why wouldn't I?  That's awesome.  And that's what you were gunning for?  I love those guys, man.  I mean, for a while they had me on some religious right website that had me like, public enemy 
[03:12:30]  number two behind Michael Moore, which was...  Wow.  That was pretty good.  Hard to get past Michael Moore.  Yeah, in a lot of different ways.  Yeah, hard to get around them.  Yeah, so why did you choose that?  Just to give them shit or...  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  Not a big fan of Bush, are you?  I wouldn't think you're a fan of Al-Qaeda, though, either.  No, I'm not a fan of any of them bastards, you know?  I'm a fan...  Either side, right?  Yeah, you know, some are fans.  Alcohol, fanned. 
[03:13:00]  Al-Qaeda, not a fan.  That is a handy name to have, isn't it?  It's great, yeah.  With anything behind it like that.  Not a fan of Bush, obviously.  No, no.  No?  You'll never see Al Bush, either.  No, no.  What did you think of the last election of John Kerry?  Did you vote for him, or did you think he was another asshole?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, I mean, it's just...  The whole special interest group thing that runs the government is what we really got  to dismantle, these little prop-up cardboard cutouts that they put up. 
[03:13:30]  The problem with Bush, here's the problem with Bush.  In a sense, I almost appreciate Reagan now, because at least Reagan knew he wasn't running  things, he was just acting as president, right?  Yeah.  As an actor, and Bush actually thinks he is, which is creepy.  I mean, he actually thinks he's running things and shit.  We were talking in the office about Bush and how much, like, I just can't stand him.  And I was a supporter of him early on.  And when you look at somebody, even like Reagan or Clinton, for that matter, two opposite 
[03:14:00]  ends of the spectrum, you remember during their presidency, them sitting at their desk  at the Oval Office and signing shit.  Yeah.  Whatever they were doing.  It was a bill for the environment, or it was some kind of tax thing that Reagan was  doing that no one liked, but he felt strongly about it or something.  It was something.  When...  You never see Bush in the Oval Office working.  No.  The guy has done nothing as far as getting this clear and clear.  Listen, you know what was cool about Clinton and all them shots of him signing shit in 
[03:14:30]  the Oval Office is you know he was getting a hummer underneath the desk at the same time.  Or he had to move the page because, like, he's got a cum stain on it.  Imagine, like, some fucking important bill.  You put it on your desk and a little cum starts seeping through where you signed it and smudges  your signature.  How wonderful that is.  But you never see Bush doing anything.  He's always giving the same fucking speech every time.  Yeah.  He's up there, evil Al-Qaeda, we've got to deal with...  You know, it's always about freedom. 
[03:15:00]  It's pretty good.  We're staying the course and do it.  And he's never working as president.  What do you think about the Inquirer's story that he's drinking?  Yeah.  Again, you think so?  Absolutely.  Well, I think the Inquirer reported this a couple days ago.  His poll numbers are like, what, 31% approval?  His poll numbers are in the shitter.  He's got the war.  He's got two fucking major disasters that were closed.  One of them, you know, the first one at least, a complete closed.  He's probably back on the crack, too.  Well, someone else has said that he's...  I think so, because, you know, if you're president, you know you've got a good deal.  What room do you go to to smoke crack if you're the president? 
[03:15:30]  What room is secure enough?  That's a basement thing.  That's got to be a cube with no window.  Incoming nuclear weapon from Russia.  That room that's left over.  Right.  That's the room you smoke crack in.  Can you imagine having that kind of power, though, man?  One time, I wound up at this party with Ronald Reagan Jr.  Yeah.  Okay, so the first thing I asked him was like, have you ever beat off in the White House?  I mean, it's like, I had asked...  Was that the first?  That's the very first thing, because I've always wondered that.  It's like, you know, did you put on Nancy's dresses and kind of whack it and, like, pretend 
[03:16:00]  to pick up the red phone and start a nuclear war?  Some kind of crazy shit, right?  Sure.  So I asked him that.  Give him a lollipop, man.  And he was like, no, no, no, no.  I never beat off in the White House.  I'm like, get out of here.  That's the first thing I would do if I ever was invited to the White House.  I'd go beat off in every room.  It'd just be a gas, right?  Jacking in the Lincoln bedroom.  Jacking in the Lincoln room, right?  But he denied it.  So I finally just kept on him and on him.  He goes, all right, all right, all right.  When I was nine and my dad lived in the governor's office, I did let my Labrador retrievers pee 
[03:16:30]  on me on the front lawn.  I'm like, you'll admit to that, but you won't admit to whacking it in the White House?  Golden shower from his dogs.  That's fucked up, man.  He's a strange guy.  Yeah, he is, man.  Ronald Reagan Jr. was always a strange guy.  Yeah, they kind of tried to keep him under wraps.  And then he got a lot of publicity.  Hardcore Democrat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of against his dad.  Strange guy.  Yeah, but like I was saying, though, at least back then.  He can't be a Democrat.  He didn't whack it in the White House.  Not a good Democrat. 
[03:17:00]  I'm not a Democrat, are you?  Ask Al about ministry's piss army.  What is that?  That's kind of like our kiss army.  Kiss army.  It's the golden version of the kiss army.  All right.  What do you think of other guys that are supposedly the legendary status, like guys from Kiss?  Gene Simmons, you see him out there hawking his stuff.  Yeah, that's kind of weird. 
[03:17:30]  I'm not really into that, man.  I mean, it's like, well, I'm also jealous, too.  He says he's, what, had sex with 11,000 women a year or something.  You've got a wedding ring on it.  I think the caliber of those.  Yeah, I've got a wedding ring.  I have sex with one gal a year.  We were just talking about marriage.  Well, not once a year, but one gal.  Right, right.  Joe Rogan, not a fan of marriage.  Just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me.  Yeah.  How long have you been married?  What?  Oops, I'm in trouble.  Oh, is that her right there? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  How long?  Three years.  Three years?  Yeah, three beautiful, golden, amazing years.  There you go.  Things going well?  Yeah.  Sign a prenup?  No.  No?  I'm fucked.  You are so screwed, my friend.  That's it.  Way to fucking go, Al.  Half those hats are hers.  His next tour will be playing a yukulele.  Yeah, a yukulele.  Coffee houses and bongos for me, man. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Not that she isn't lovely, and I'm sure you two get along, but what made you get married?  We were at Graceland.  Yeah?  Believe it or not, that's the answer.  And that does it?  I don't know.  Elvis is some kind of magic, weird shit.  We got married at Graceland.  You see a vision, get married.  Lose all your shit.  No, Graceland is bizarre to get married to men.  They have all these...  You got married in Graceland?  In Graceland, yeah.  All right?  At the little chapel behind in his backyard or whatever.  And as you go all through Graceland, they have all these fucking rocks that are like, 
[03:19:00]  you know, fake rocks.  Fake things that have speakers in it that whenever you pass by the rock, it has some kind of motion  sensor.  And it says Elvis thing.  So you think you're losing your fucking mind all the time you're walking around there.  Elvis?  Hey, man, don't worry.  It's going to be okay.  It's all going to be okay, man.  Go ahead and get married, man.  It's all right.  Seriously, it's creepy.  He's the most whored out performer ever.  Elvis Cooper.  Oh, yeah.  I went there, and I wanted to laugh at him, and I actually went into his house, and I felt 
[03:19:30]  bad for him.  Like, I wanted to laugh at all his furniture and shit, and it's just like, people just walking  up to his grave, taking pictures and shit.  It's just like, can you let the guy go?  No, no, they can't.  Speakers that speak his voice as you're walking through, like, ghostly advice?  What is he doing?  No, no.  This is a true story.  All right.  So we're at the altar, at the little chapel, me and Angie.  And I'm sweating, because I've already had one really ruinous, failed, horrible, shitty-ass 
[03:20:00]  marriage.  So why would you do it again?  Well, because she's great, okay?  But not only that, we were at Graceland, I got caught up in the moment, and I'm really  glad I did.  But at any rate, I'm at the altar.  So I go, look, I got to take a piss.  I got to take a piss.  So I left Angie at the altar, went to go take a piss.  And in the actual bathroom, next to the altar, there's an escape door.  Get out of here.  Guys, I swear to God, there's an escape door, in case you just want to, like, bolt at the 
[03:20:30]  last second.  Does that rock say it'll run, man?  Just run.  No, no.  There you go, man.  So I'm in there looking at the door.  I'm throwing water on my face, because I'm kind of like, man, do I really want to do this?  I don't know.  And I'm looking at the escape door in the back, which is open, which actually, you can  haul ass and run, right?  And I'm throwing water on my face.  All of a sudden, I hear through the speakers, sorry, man, it's all going to be okay.  And they do that shit on purpose.  I swear, I talked to Pastor, what was his name? 
[03:21:00]  Pastor Bear.  Pastor Bear was the guy who looked exactly like Jerry Falwell.  It was creepy, man.  Yeah, it was creepy.  Jerry Falwell married us, basically.  And, yeah, they got Elvis piped through everything.  Everything, man.  It's creepy.  It's sad, man.  Did you plan on getting married there, or did you just get there and go, hey, let's  get married?  Last minute thing, yeah.  That's one of those places that people like Vegas and there, people just decide.  Me and Britney, you know, it's the same kind of deal.  His house is, like, hooked up from, like, it was like his house was this shit in, like, 
[03:21:30]  1972.  Yeah.  See, he has, like, Elvis just liked to watch all the football games, and he has, like, three,  like, three TVs that are, like, the kind you have, like, in your kitchen on the counter  that you don't even fucking have cable hooked up to.  The Zenith.  The old Zenith.  Zenith TVs to watch the football.  The Trinitron.  Yeah.  That's a hell of a way to get married there, Al.  Thanks, guys.  They left everything like it was at the time.  You know, hey, that's great.  You are really going to polish off that bottle. 
[03:22:00]  How many bottles do you say you go through a day?  About 17.  17?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  Well, in between three and 17.  How many?  How many?  Hold me up.  One.  She's saying one.  So the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  Angie's pulling up your spot over there.  Oh, oh, oh, you're asking me what she allows me to drink before the rolling pin comes out  over the head.  That's one.  She don't look like a rolling pin type.  It's only 10.30.  He's already done with his first one.  It's a hell of a piece.  Hey, we got Mark from Iowa.  Go ahead, Mark.  I was going to say, Al should change his name to Al Amoni. 
[03:22:30]  Hey, thanks a lot, asshole.  Very good.  Very nice.  Very nice.  That's a funny one.  Go ahead.  Spread that idea around.  Nice job.  Some guy called Radio Guy.  Radio Guy.  Hey, hey.  I just wanted to ask Al about, you know, back in the day, he used to sound like the Pet Shop  Boys.  So I was wondering what he thinks about, you know, what the music they did back then.  Do they still get fans coming, like, asking for that kind of crap?  Hell no, man. 
[03:23:00]  I killed the Pets.  What?  But the earlier music was more what?  The earlier music was complete crap.  The record label had me basically like Milli Vanilli.  Ouch.  Without the dreads.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I mean, seriously, I had stuff written for that record that wound up two records later  because the label I was on was like, they appointed a producer, they wrote the songs,  they wrote the choruses, they appointed everyone for me.  And I just sat around like, when do I lip sync? 
[03:23:30]  And what year was this about?  83.  83.  And it was that type of, like, Pet Shop Boy sound?  Oh, it's disgusting, yeah.  Wow.  I've longed to sound that record.  Any songs we would know from that?  I hope not.  Well, look it up.  You got any?  Fuck you, man.  That's it.  I'm two bottles now.  We just leaped right on it.  Let's look it up, man.  Look it up.  Wait, wait.  I've got some titles.  Listen, I just went through hell this morning on ESPN, all right?  I'm a Blackhawks fan, lifer, and the first thing they show when I'm on there is the 1971 
[03:24:00]  shot of Henri Richard in Game 7 against the Canadians in 71, beating Tony Esposito.  I was curled up in fetal position, started sucking my thumb and crying, whimpering like  a baby on ESPN.  Now you guys are going to fuck with me hard on this, too?  You guys suck, man.  We have fucked.  The thing is, though, we've brought out our first ever broadcast on the radio, mine and  Opie's, and it's horrific.  It's impossible to listen to.  Jimmy Norton brought his first tape of doing comedy, and it's one of those things. 
[03:24:30]  It's a cringe moment.  2004.  Sometimes you just have to sit through.  But I'm only allowed one cringe a day.  Is that it?  All right.  I already had my cringe moment.  2005.  Keep going.  Nathaniel will never find it.  You'll probably get lucky, and it won't be on the left.  I will kick your ass.  Seriously.  I'm going through that bulletproof glass fucking window, and I'm holding Terry in you, man.  We got Joe Rogan.  We're not scared.  Let's fuck up.  All right.  He will kill you.  How's that for a Fear Factor episode?  Will you jump through that window and kill that man? 
[03:25:00]  This looks like a murder.  There's a girl with an electric eel in a tank surrounding her head.  Yeah, they're mores.  Oh, mores?  I remember this episode.  Mores are nasty, too, though, right?  Yeah, they're dangerous.  They'll bite your face off.  They bit the shit out of one of the guys that was handling it.  In our massive computer, we don't have the 1983 stuff.  Hey, dude, get some brown recluses on your show.  Look what they did to me.  Check that out.  What the fuck is that?  What are those?  I got bit by a brown recluse.  They wanted to take my arm off.  What is a brown recluse?  It's a fucking asshole brown, hairy spider, man. 
[03:25:30]  In Austin, Texas.  Is that what those divots are?  It looks like someone took an awl.  No, no.  See this right here?  Where was that?  In Austin.  Texas, yeah?  Yeah.  Got them bugs there?  The thing swelled up like Popeye's arm, right?  And I'm like, no, I'll just do some Benadryl.  I hate fucking doctors.  So I'm like eating Benadryl.  I'm just like, ain't going to go.  But they're finally like, dude, now your finger is, this middle finger is the size of  like a fucking kielbasa, right?  So they're like, you got to go to the hospital.  So I go to the hospital.  I'm thinking they're going to give me some antibiotics or something.  I go in there. 
[03:26:00]  The first thing they say is, well, we have to take that arm off now.  Holy shit.  And I'm like, whoa, wait a minute.  I don't play fucking drums for Def Leppard.  Okay.  I'm a guitar player.  And I think there's only one one-armed guitar player.  And that's the guy the Pope keeps hostage in the Vatican that plays classical guitar with  his feet.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that guy?  That guy rules.  He's not allowed to leave either.  They'd have him hostage.  And we got to free the one-armed fucking guitar player.  From the Vatican. 
[03:26:30]  So I was like, tell him that.  So they made me sign something saying like, well, if I die from the poison, I can't sue  them and all this shit.  I'm like, whatever, dude.  I'm not playing drums for Def Leppard.  What did they have to do to your arm?  They had to cut it open from the middle finger all the way up.  Holy shit.  And drain the fucking poison.  Across the palm of your hand.  I drove to the hospital with a kielbasa like this.  Through the wrist up to your elbow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Ay-ya.  So they wanted to just chop it off right away.  Oh, yeah.  They were like, you're gone, dude. 
[03:27:00]  You're going to die.  And I'm like, no, no, no, no.  So what did they do?  From a spider.  What did they do after they opened it up?  They opened it up, shit.  They drained the poison and shit.  Like, what fucking here is this?  But here's how creepy the whole medical system is.  It's like, right as they're putting me under, right, with, you know, the wonderful gas.  Yeah.  I love that shit.  It's pretty cool.  But anyway, right as they're putting me under, here comes another fucking legal beagle  with, like, a piece of paper and a pen.  As I'm starting to nod off, they're going, and you also can't sue us if they fuck up 
[03:27:30]  your tattoos.  Oh.  I mean, they're all worried about everything, man.  Like, I'm like, look, just keep my fucking arm.  I don't care about the tattoos, dude.  I'm not playing drums for Def Leppard, okay?  Did you say to him, after all is said and done, do you call up that doctor and go, you  were going to cut my fucking arm off, and it's fine now?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Is the guy, like, lazy?  Yeah.  Yeah, totally.  It's like you bring a piece of shit car in.  That's a total, man.  We'll get you into something else.  Dude, yeah.  Hey, they cut my toe off in Texas.  They're butchers there. 
[03:28:00]  I see it.  What did they do to your toe?  I got infected.  Oh, Angie doesn't want us to see your toe.  I got a spider.  Well, no, I'm showing my toe.  Yeah, right on.  Last time I was here, I thumped my, whatever, on a microphone and kind of freaked Bodhi out,  but this toe is actually cooler, see?  Holy shit!  Holy shit!  I thought you...  They cut it off.  I thought you meant one of the little ones.  They cut it off.  Holy crap.  No, no, no.  The big toe is gone.  It took out the big one.  The big toe is completely gone.  Oh, you want this?  You want a close-up? 
[03:28:30]  Well, should I whack it while you're like...  Say it.  What?  You sold?  I sold my toe for rock and roll.  Wow.  Holy shit.  It's completely gone.  Joe Rogan, are you freaked out?  Nah, Joe's seen too much.  I thought I got you fucked by the horse.  I'm okay.  Joe has seen too much.  In a weird way, it makes it more aerodynamic.  Yeah, wouldn't the foot be better without the big toe?  It's more efficient?  It's kind of freaky because, like, I was shoplifting sunglasses right after I got out of jail at this  Sitco.  You know, I was going to sit-go. 
[03:29:00]  He's the big singer of the ministry.  Jesus, Al.  Got a big hole in your socks?  It's for sport.  Do you ever go to the beach?  Yeah, well, you know...  How do you handle that flip-flop thing?  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  I got a...  He's got to tape it off.  I don't know.  The flip-flop thing is out of the question, dude.  Forget it.  Do you tape it?  I listen to it.  Do I tape it?  Wait, I want it...  No, I staple it.  Do you have some duct tape?  I staple it.  I want to hear the...  Dude, I got a roadie that actually has webbed feet to make up for my missing toe. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, my God.  I want to hear the shoplifting story.  All right.  So, I'm in there shoplifting sunglasses.  And this black chick comes in on crutches.  It's a theme today.  Just freaking out.  And I'm like really struggling.  I go...  You know, I'm trying to make conversation because I see that the fucking guy's staring at me by the sunglasses.  So, I know I'm going to get busted.  So, I'm like trying to play nicey, right?  So, I'm talking to her and she's like, I just had my toe amputated.  I'm like, so did I.  When?  And she's like, three months before I did. 
[03:30:00]  And I go, you're on crutches?  She's like, yeah.  The doctor told me I'd be on crutches for six months.  I was out there.  I walked out the next day.  So, I went back.  I called my doctor that took my toe off.  And, oh, first of all, I wouldn't give it back.  I wanted to wear it as an earring or some shit.  But I was like, the fuckers took it and sent it to CDC for some reason or whatever to see if it was toxic or blowing or toxic toe.  So, I call my doctor and he's like, well, I've never quite seen this where we take a big toe off and somebody walks right out of the hospital. 
[03:30:30]  And he goes, the only thing I could probably fathom is that you've just been so high and drunk all your life, you're used to walking out of equilibrium, right?  So, apparently, now I'm like normal without the toe.  It balanced things out.  It balanced things out.  You never said, how did you lose it?  Oh, I stepped on some fucking splinter that I left in there for like, god damn, I don't know.  Are you shitting me?  I thought it was another spider or something.  No, no.  The spider's got it in for me, dude. 
[03:31:00]  I'm fucked.  And didn't want to go to the doctor or something to get it out?  I hate doctors.  But at what point?  They take a part off me.  Well, you know, he does have a point.  They think he's missing the connection.  There's a lesson to be learned.  All right, all right.  All right, I got it, guys.  It must have turned black or something, right?  Yeah, it turned black.  Did you at least take pictures of it before they hacked it off?  No, I did.  I thought it was fine.  I thought, eat a couple Benadryl, it'll go away. 
[03:31:30]  That Benadryl.  Where's the idea that was a cure-all?  I know, man.  That Benadryl stock is just dropping.  Al Jorgensen of Ministry.  You're all right, man.  That's great, man.  We got the picture of your missing big toe up online already.  Wow, that was fast.  That was really fast.  Damn, it's that fast.  And there's already like...  You guys are stoked.  That's a real fucking rock star right there.  Sold my toe for rock and roll. 
[03:32:00]  Wow.  It looks like your other toe is making up for your big toe.  It's getting bigger or something.  Getting wider.  No, it's pissed.  It's pissed.  It's got to take over the top.  It's got to do all this extra work.  Twice the work.  Exactly.  Twice the work, half the pay.  A bunch of little kids like the dad left.  They're fucking angry.  You're the man now.  That first toe had to become the man of the family before he even wanted to.  I didn't have a childhood.  It was the dad raising the other toes when he was 16.  I mean, I didn't want it, but this little piggy is now the breadwinner. 
[03:32:30]  Let's go to Elmer.  Elmer, what's up?  Elmer.  Hey, what's up, man?  I want you to ask Al about the time he blew up his tour bus.  Al, you blowed up your tour bus?  Well, yeah.  I got shrapnel in my eardrum.  I took a couple of Benadryl.  It was actually probably the fucking coolest thing with my eyes that I've ever seen.  I mean, probably the birth of my daughter with a close second, I'm blowing up the tour bus. 
[03:33:00]  And now what happened?  Okay.  So, first, I have to preface this by saying when I was in Nashville, Tennessee on the Lollapalooza tour in 90...  Oh, back in 93, kids.  Anyways, so, this toothless, like, old man at this, like, truck stop where we go in and shop with sunglasses.  Like, me, it's like, hey, you guys want to buy some fireworks? 
[03:33:30]  I'm like, yeah, yeah, cool.  Oh, shit.  Don't take long to put two and two together here.  So, I went behind the Petra.  It was a Petra truck stop.  And I bought this, what looked like a fucking bazooka.  I mean, it was like six feet long metal tube, all right?  And we like to have fun with fireworks.  Anyways, I mean, we wake each other up on the bunks with, like, M-80s and shit in the bunk.  Like, wake up, fucker, boom, you know?  So, we're kind of prone to that anyway. 
[03:34:00]  Lose a thumb.  But this was a fucking bazooka, dude.  But I was like, yeah, it was cheap.  It was like 50 bucks.  It's like, yeah, awesome.  Bring it, you know?  And I forgot about it.  I set it up on there.  And then Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers was traveling with us for a while, too.  So, Gibby got into our M-80 supply that we usually throw at each other and shit.  So, Gibby's like, hey, man, let's let these open the bus.  I'm like, oh, that is so lame, man.  We do that every day.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, I remember.  I got this fucking six-foot pyro on here. 
[03:34:30]  So, we're in the back of the bus.  We light the fucking thing.  And this thing, the guy told me, I remember the toothless guy told me, he's supposed to  make, like, a pirate ship in the air or something.  It's supposed to make this galleon with multicolored shit.  So, we light the thing in the bus while we're rolling down the highway between Houston and  Dallas, right?  Where are you aiming at? 
[03:35:00]  We're in the very back lounge because that's the only place I'm allowed to be.  I go right to the back of the bus, right?  Holy shit.  So, we light it.  And I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  I'm thinking, all right, we're going to put it out, okay?  I'll light it and just freak everyone out a little bit.  The thing's a professional pyro.  It's got an underwater fuse.  You cannot put it out.  So, we're like, you have to cut it in front of it, right?  And no one has scissors.  So, everyone just scrambles out of the back room and just, whoa, diving into Bunsen. 
[03:35:30]  And it's down to me, Gibby, and this guy named Greg Workman who runs Ipecac Records, right?  And we're all passing the thing back and forth going, you take it, you take it, you take it,  you take it, you take it, you take it, you take it.  So, it was totally, yeah, it was, you know, Acme Explosive.  So, at that point, Gibby jumps down into the final open bunk, shuts the curtain and hunkers down.  Me and Greg are still passing it back and forth. 
[03:36:00]  I finally go, Greg, that's it, man, I'm out of here.  And so, Greg, like, just gets down on one knee at the very back of the bus and aims it for the front of the bus.  That's all you can do.  Booyah!  The thing goes off, and they had the front door closed up front because the rest of the band was a bunch of straight-edge guys playing bridge or some shit up there.  And they always, like, thought we were disgusting, so they always put us in the back of the bus.  And even for them, this was pretty cool.  It's like, or not uncool, I should say.  It's just like, you know, what was that explosion? 
[03:36:30]  Because this explosion comes up, starts hitting the door between the front and the back of the bus like this.  Ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.  All these pellets.  Pellets bounce off the door and catch every bunk on fire.  All right?  And the great thing about this was is every fire was a different color.  It was like Apocalypse Now on the fucking bridge scene, dude.  So the whole bus is on this colored fire.  All of a sudden, the brakes slam on. 
[03:37:00]  The bus driver's like, that's it.  I'm calling the police.  You motherfuckers.  My bus is on fire.  I'm calling the police right now.  So he makes us all get off the bus.  Take everything off.  You're kicked off.  You're kicked off.  So we had a keg of beer on tap in the back.  So we grabbed that, left our luggage on, just grabbed the keg of beer, went off and waited for the cops, right?  So the cops come up and see this bus on the side of the road with purple, orange, green smoke pouring, pouring out of the thing, man.  I mean, it was so psychedelic, right? 
[03:37:30]  A crow's nest on top and spunklers.  These guys were right out of fucking Dukes of Hazzard, these state troopers that came up like, boy.  And the bus driver's jumping up and down, literally having a tantrum, like jumping, like, I want these boys in jail.  They ruined my bus.  They ruined my bus.  And the fucking cop looks at him and just goes, boy, get these boys back on the bus.  What did you expect?  These are rockers.  This ain't Mozart.  Which is awesome, because we're sitting here pouring, like, drinks off a keg of beer on the side of the road, laughing our ass off, while the bus driver has no solution to this, man. 
[03:38:00]  You've got to know that's bad if it's going to make a galleon.  It's not like a sparkler or fucking like an aerial bomb or something.  If something's going to make a galleon, there's a lot of shit in there that's going to burn.  Well, dude, it sent, the recoil sent Greg, like, three feet in the air.  What a great fucking story. 
[03:38:30]  That's the greatest tour bus story ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Well, it wasn't that great.  It cost us, what, $63,000?  In hindsight, it's got to be worth it.  No, no, it's worth it.  At least $63,000.  Yeah, I know.  The pirate ship line is the best.  The colored smoke was the best, dude.  That was so apocalypse now.  God, I wish you had video of that.  That would have been insane.  Kind of a little bit hectic to get a little bit of video camera going, man.  You take it, you take it, you take it, you take it, you take it.  Great shit, man.  By the way, people are checking out your missing toe picture like crazy. 
[03:39:00]  Cool.  On opiananthony.com.  It's Al Jorgensen of Ministry.  Let's say hi to Scott.  In good old Tennessee.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, Al, I was just wondering when the next album's coming out, man.  Yeah, we should do some business here, right?  When you said Tennessee, I thought he was going to go,  Hey, Al, I was the one that sold you that.  All the tooth is good.  When's the next album coming out?  April 13th.  That's my daughter's birthday, and that's when the new one's going to come out.  Well, I mean, I got one out today or something. 
[03:39:30]  They want me to shill, but they being the label.  What's out today?  Uh, Rantology.  And what's that about?  I don't know.  You keep asking me all them hard questions, man.  I don't know.  Is it what?  Is it remixes or something?  It's a bunch of shit on there.  You're not happy with it?  No, it's all great.  I thought so.  This guy rocks.  Al rocks. 
[03:40:00]  Derek, you got a little something to play for Al Jorison?  Oh, you fucking...  I will attack.  Go ahead, play it.  Oh, you suck.  Oh, my God.  Make it stop!  Make it stop!  From 1983.  Shut the fuck up.  You suck.  Seriously, after I'm done here, you are so getting your ass kicked.  He's going to kill you, Derek.  What were you wearing when you were singing this? 
[03:40:30]  What was I wearing?  Did you have, like, a vest with, like, no shirt?  Yeah, that and a G-string.  We all have our crosses to bear from the past, my friend.  All right, hey, make this equal opportunity.  Play his first shit.  Yeah, it's really bad.  All right.  It's really bad.  There you go, fuckhead.  Nice job.  I'm so happy with you right now.  I can't believe Derek was brave enough to do that.  No, that's pretty cool.  He's got some balls.  I may spare his life and beat him to an inch of it.  How's that?  We'll spare him, though.  We'll spare him. 
[03:41:00]  Wow.  That's terrific.  No, it's not.  It's 1983.  I ain't coming here to get this shelter.  I could do that everywhere.  We thought we were all getting along.  No, it's awful.  And we got you a bottle of wine.  We had to, you know, make fun of you.  Well, it's gone.  It was a bottle of wine.  It was a bottle of wine.  I was going to ask you for a little bit.  Now it's a projectile.  All right.  This has been a hell of a show, I've got to tell you. 
[03:41:30]  Hell of a show.  Are you promoting anything else, Al?  You don't give a shit, do you?  You really don't.  It's hockey season.  There's no time to promote.  Let's go Islanders, right?  Fuck you.  I see the shirt, man.  Blackhawks all the way for you.  And we stole your defenseman, too.  So, eat my shit.  Hey, is that a Michael Jordan tattoo?  23?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, baby.  I'm so into basketball.  But what is the 23 about?  It's a mystic number, dude.  Don't you know? 
[03:42:00]  Don't you do numerology?  What's wrong with you, dude?  God, man.  That's a real powerful number, dude.  What is the 23?  But it looked like a basketball.  It's a long story.  All right, fuck it.  We don't have fucking time.  All I thought, I saw what looked like a basketball tattoo and a 23, but I'm not a basketball.  Well, now I don't see that.  Jesus.  From a distance, it looked like it.  I see that it's not now.  Way to go.  But then I saw the 23, I'm like, hey.  It does kind of look like a basketball.  It did, right?  Thank you.  Zeppelin.  Yeah, the Zeppelin.  Let me say that.  The Zoso symbols, right? 
[03:42:30]  Very cool.  BOC used to be one of my favorite bands ever.  Does anybody remember Laughter?  I love that.  That's my favorite all-time rock line.  It is so pompous and bad, man.  Oh, no.  She's allowing you a second bottle of wine.  Another bottle of wine.  We've got another show coming in.  You can just hang with them, too.  Ron and Fez, they're great guys.  Ron and Fez are awesome.  BOC used to be one of my favorite bands, but I saw them in Huntington.  In, like, just a few years back.  In 31.  And, yeah.  I saw that.  And I'm like, you could hear, you could talk to each other next to each other. 
[03:43:00]  Are you serious?  They were that low?  I was like, what the fuck, man?  Wait, wait, wait.  You know what's even worse?  I used to love Foghat.  Yeah.  Foghat rule, right?  Same thing.  Now they're touring with only the original drummer's mustache in a glass case.  I'm serious.  It's all new kids.  They're, like, 18 years old, and they have Roger Earle's mustache in a glass case.  I just heard the mustache.  It's the original drummer's mustache.  That's awesome. 
[03:43:30]  And they're playing high school parking lots.  All right, listen, I've got to thank Joe Rogan.  Joe Rogan, anything we're promoting?  Joe Rogan?
