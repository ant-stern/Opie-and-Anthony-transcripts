<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their pre-show routine and Jimmy Norton's absence.  A musical interlude followed, leading into sexually explicit and offensive banter.  World Wrestling Federation champion Arun Sheik then appeared as a guest, engaging in nonsensical and offensive conversation. The conversation turned to the recent tsunami in the Indian Ocean, with the hosts making insensitive comments about the victims and their reactions to graphic news footage.  A technical mishap occurred when Opie spilled coffee on his keyboard, causing significant disruption.

The show continued with tangents about Ellen DeGeneres, Reggie White's death (initially with inaccurate speculation about steroid use, later corrected), the New York Jets' loss, and a comedy show they attended.  A lengthy complaint about XM Satellite Radio's poor planning for their Las Vegas trip dominated a segment, filled with frustration and offensive jokes.  The discussion also touched on Robert Reed's portrayal of Mike Brady. Another musical interlude concluded this portion.

The next segment opened with a discussion of coffee preferences and was followed by XM Radio advertisements.  Jim Norton joined the studio, recounting an awkward Christmas dinner conversation with his parents about his radio show's content, specifically an incident involving defecation.  The hosts then discussed XM radios as Christmas gifts, transitioning to a discussion of their recent guest, Bernie Goetz, the "subway vigilante."  An email from a staff member, Ben, revealed Goetz’s desire to become friends with Ben, smoke pot, and program music for the show.  The hosts debated the absurdity of letting Goetz DJ, recalling his rambling and seemingly racist tendencies during a previous interview, including the playing of songs some listeners considered racist (such as Wesley Willis's "Kill Whitey").  They then discussed listener interpretation.

The conversation shifted to Christmas gifts, including cancelled-out gift cards and concerns about giving cash to a relative. A listener called in with a humorous comparison of Goetz's actions to early cell phone technology.  The hosts discussed spam emails, reading examples of outrageous solicitations, punctuated by Opie's malfunctioning computer.  The show touched on Peyton Manning's touchdown record and his father's reaction, compared to "The Great Santini," the box office success of "Meet the Fockers," and the tsunami in Southeast Asia, interspersed with comments about cultural differences and the Thai sex tourism industry, including graphic details.  A reminiscence about a female guest smoking a cigarette from her vagina followed. The segment concluded with a profane "fuck you" segment targeting various people and entities, a heavy metal parody, and their top 10 movie picks.


The following segment highlighted the hosts' surprising lack of awareness of popular 2004 films, referencing *People* and *Newsweek* magazine lists.  They admitted to seeing few acclaimed films like *Hotel Rwanda*, *Kinsey*, and *Sideways*, diverting into discussions about the song "You Got the Touch" (misidentified as from *Boogie Nights*), a listener confirming "Feel My Heat" as another *Boogie Nights* song, and a lengthy discussion about Steve, a pirate movie distributor. The hosts debated remaking classic films (*The Manchurian Candidate*, *The Honeymooners*), expressing strong opinions on race and casting. They discussed 2004 fads from *People* magazine (celebrity poker, Kabbalah strings, etc.) leading to a vulgar discussion about the Iraq War. The segment included descriptions of unsolicited "sex help" DVDs and a caller's mention of a dwarf-themed program.

A segment focused on instructional sex videos the hosts received, critiquing the actors' appearances and the videos' production quality with graphic and vulgar language.  They discussed lubricants and attempted to play the DVDs on a malfunctioning PlayStation.  A caller, Josh from Nebraska, made a joke about one of the hosts' purported lubricant expertise. The discussion included descriptions of the videos' explicit content and  "oops" moments from celebrities.  A brief discussion about the supposed curative powers of fruits preceded a promotion for a "Wow sticker" event.

The final segment featured XM Satellite Radio advertisements, followed by a description of a "Sex in the Office" video and a critique of various comic strips using crude language and sexual innuendo. Excerpts from a corporate sexual harassment training video were played and mocked.  Listener calls offered "what-did-we-learn" takeaways, including comments on Norton's nipple preferences and a studio guest's appearance.  The hosts ended with derisive comments on Ted Turner and CNN's news coverage.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  He's bitching about something, Ben is herkying and jerking somewhere, and Anthony and I are sitting here reading newspapers so we can plow through this shit one more time.  We're moments away from another Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  We're moments away from another Opie and Anthony show.

[00:02:00]  Freedom and weep, the dead match hand again  I see it in your eyes, take one look and die  The only thing you see, you know it's going to be

[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  I would like to extend to you an invitation to the passport.  Get your cock out. 
[00:07:00]  You know the holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for both people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, viola...  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  V.O.B. and Anthony Show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  I'm being honest. I don't know anything.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk, Nick, friend. 
[00:07:30]  This is Arun Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation champion.  Pleasure for me, to the Anthony, and Opium, and pleasure to come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, and hello to all people, to the wrestling, to the pleasure to be here.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro. 
[00:08:00]  Do you want to kiss me, or...?  You have softness kiss.  I'm going to kiss you on your mouth.  Don't just stare at it. Eat it. 
[00:08:30]  Do you know what a boob is?  He would have an enormous swangstuk.  I just, you gotta durumain,  I the mêmef you lie...  I just gon' hit you, motherfucker,  He is the mêmef you lie... 
[00:09:00]  is the mêmef you dummy.  I just get out the...  I I want to...  He gonna bump back hai...  God save...  F you you, motherfucker.  He has fucked you, you dumb fuckfuck.  Hey, good morning to you and yours and everyone else. 
[00:09:30]  Why the freak are we working this morning?  I don't know, but we're here.  This is the stupidest idea I've ever had.  We're here live.  Hey, guys, you know, a lot of people are buying XM Soundlight Radio for Christmas,  and they're getting them hooked up, so I think we need to be live on the air  just a couple days after Christmas.  Live and learn.  What idiots we are, man.  We could have easily taken this whole week off.  No one would have noticed.  Easily.  Easily.  And it would have been so easy to do. 
[00:10:00]  Imagine how easy it would have been to take this week off.  We would just be home, and when the alarm goes off, you just shut it off,  and you're not doing the show.  Right.  Like Jimmy Norton did, I guess.  Lazy Jimmy Norton.  Just like little Jimmy did because I'm looking at his seat, and what am I seeing?  Some dried sausage where he should be sitting.  Dried sausage and Thailand chicks.  Thailand porno website printouts.  And a big fat dried sausage, and no sign of our little meaty breasted nothing. 
[00:10:30]  He's truly a diva, man.  Anthony and I get here at five.  He strolls in whenever the hell he wants.  He's trolling through the papers, and, of course, the week between Christmas and New Year's.  Nothing is happening.  Nothing.  Unless you're stuck in a tsunami.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  That's pretty much a drag.  A tidal wave and a tsunami.  Those people are used to it over there.  Not really.  Happens all the time.  Not really.  That's the big news story, obviously. 
[00:11:00]  The latest death toll is up to 15,000 people, Anthony.  Has the news here gone, tsunami, could it happen in our area?  Tune in at 11.  I guarantee the news will be all over that.  All day long.  Could it happen here?  Trying to localize the story.  Even to you folks in Idaho, somehow the local news will go, could a tsunami hit Idaho?  These douches.  Wisconsin, are we safe from a tsunami?  Right.  Let me be the big buzzkill. 
[00:11:30]  East Coast, not a tsunami risk.  No.  All right.  When was the last tsunami to hit the East Coast?  Although the news will be all over it all day long.  You know, and then they'll have some dopey science guy come on and talk about, you know,  there are fault lines in the Atlantic Ocean.  And if the Teutonic plates do shift, a tsunami could indeed hit the, shut up, it cannot.  When was the last time it happened?  I don't know.  If ever.  But they love to pound the local angle. 
[00:12:00]  Well, here it is in the local paper.  The eastern coast of the United States is less vulnerable to a tsunami than is the Indian Ocean region.  But less vulnerable doesn't mean it can't happen here.  Well, they've got to leave the door open for the possibility.  A little drama.  Uh, then is, uh, the Indian Ocean region because earthquakes are far less common under the Atlantic.  Right.  But, uh, the coverage of the tsunami is just unbelievable.  I'm watching it on the news as we speak. 
[00:12:30]  Right behind you, they're showing, uh, Thailand and parts of India.  Do you think Leslie Nielsen was the first one to see the tidal wave coming?  Like in the Poseidon adventure?  He did nothing.  He held his hands up to his face.  You know, when Leslie Nielsen was a dramatic actor.  Actually.  Hey!  Oh, hey, Jimmy.  Here he is.  We thought maybe you were caught in a tsunami.  No, no, no.  As you were getting sex from a young Thai boy.  Isn't it great?  A tsunami hit you.  Isn't it great?  Aunt and I get here real early and, you know, prepare the whole show and you get, uh, and 
[00:13:00]  you get the most credit and you get to stroll in whenever you want.  It's so nice, isn't it?  Yes.  The most credit?  Yeah.  Isn't it getting the most credit?  Yeah, who said that?  These days?  Jeez, I'm going to have to check on that.  Well, that's not true.  I'm going to have to count.  Ah.  One credit, two credit, one for you, one for me.  Jimmy, we were discussing how stupid this was to decide to work between...  To work on this...  Between Christmas and New Year's.  It's ridiculous.  We are truly overachievers. 
[00:13:30]  I disagree.  I think it's a good decision we made to commit.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  It's absolutely great.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  So, uh, yeah, the tsunami, the best part about the tsunami thing, there's a picture, there's  two pictures in Newsday.  Yeah.  They show a, uh, a beach resort with all the beach chairs and the umbrellas.  Who knew, by the way?  Thrown around the beach. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  With tourists looking like they're Americans and, and, and, and their tank tops and their  baggy shorts and their backpacks and their expensive watches and...  Their American blue jeans.  And sunglasses.  They're, they're, uh, surveying the damage at their beach resort.  Yeah.  It looks pretty, it looks pretty bad for them.  And, and basically, they're just showing the umbrellas over in the beach chairs.  And beach chairs.  They might have to go pretty far down the beach to get a free beach chair now.  There you go.  And, and you can tell this one guy is like really bummed cause he, he doesn't know where 
[00:14:30]  his iPod is.  And this guy's like, and this guy's like, oh my God, where's my PDA?  You know, and...  I had just bought a coconut drink.  Yeah, exactly.  Where did it go?  And where did it float off to?  So their vacation is a real drag, okay?  The guy even carved the coconut to look like a monkey head.  Yeah.  And now I can't find it.  Where's the bag of pot I bought from the local?  I left it right on my beach chair.  Now it's somewhere else. 
[00:15:00]  So they're just kind of bummed cause their vacation is ruined.  You know, they decide to fly to Sri Lanka for a Christmas vacation, I guess.  And yeah, there's even a little Coke can, you know.  Of course.  Typical resort stuff, right?  And then next to it is a lady that looks like she hasn't eaten in a month.  They all look like that there.  She's literally 80 pounds, and it's very obvious that she lost everything.  Just gone.  She's crying.  She's just holding a piece of material, probably her only possession. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  And, you know, they're just...  I mean, the newspapers, they just have a sense of humor.  It's a good juxtaposition.  Yeah, why do they have to have these two pictures, you know, side by side?  Yeah.  You see any of the news footage?  Man, you know, the whole distance thing is amazing.  As long as it's people that are far, far away, you can show anything now.  I saw a wave hit a bunch of people on the news and just drag them out to sea. 
[00:16:00]  And there was nothing.  They're flapping around like fish.  And I'm watching like, wow, this is some action movie.  This is amazing to watch.  Check this out.  And they're just human beings being dragged out to sea.  If it happened in Florida, you wouldn't see it.  Well...  If it was something, maybe Southern California, they wouldn't show that.  But we talked about that recently.  They're starting to show a lot more of that stuff.  Yeah, but...  A lot more, you know, footage of dead people and things like that.  I guess out of respect for Americans, they really don't show many Americans being swept 
[00:16:30]  out to sea and kind of drowning right there on your television.  You know, it wasn't dead bodies that were washed up on the beach.  This was people in the act of perishing.  They're just...  As they're being swept out, you know they're not being saved.  It's just a torrent.  They're dying right there.  And there's the video camera.  And you're just watching on TV going, wow, it's a good thing that's far away or I might  feel bad.  Did you see the amateur video of the ass that obviously had too many pina coladas because 
[00:17:00]  he didn't show the wave coming?  Like, ass.  Oh, he blew it?  Yeah, it's like he's obviously high up in a hotel or wherever he is and they show the  waves coming in in this one resort.  And you're looking at this footage and screaming at the guy, will you freaking pan to the right?  You want to see the wave coming.  You know, but he has it like it's set up and then you kind of, you don't even really  see it because his...  Guy didn't get the shot. 
[00:17:30]  No, he didn't really get the shot.  Well, he is on vacation.  He's probably drunk.  Really hammered.  And I never knew this was a vacation hotspot because the before and after pictures look  the same in some of these areas.  Just strewn with mud and frightening, emaciated people.  Right.  With vehicles intermingling with donkey carts.  People seem to vacation here, though.  Yeah.  Did you read the story?  I'm sure you'll be seeing it all over about the guy that was like a guest on Oprah's show 
[00:18:00]  for like 20 times, some interior decorator who barely escaped with his life.  And he survived?  He survived.  I'm sure he'll be suckling on Oprah on her show talking about it.  And everyone's happy because he's white and he survived this.  Right.  Everyone else is very tan.  Very dark.  There's over 15.  It's going to be...  I guarantee it's going to be well over 30,000 to 50,000 by the time they figure this out  or dead or dead, but no one cares about them.  No, as long as the dude from Oprah survived, we're all happy in America. 
[00:18:30]  You know what happens in this country when even hundreds of people die from a single  event?  We lose our minds.  We're very...  You got me.  It went all the way over there?  Holy shit.  How did it go so far?  I don't know.  What is that?  Coffee?  Yeah, I need some paper towels.  God, that was a perfect hit.  It looks like a fucking money shot on my keyboard.  Or we're not going to be able to play the Silence of the Lambs, the musical today.  Oh, quick.  Clean that off.  Hurry, hurry. 
[00:19:00]  Paper towels.  It's all...  Paper towels.  Paper towels.  I'm sticky.  It's all...  Holy Jesus Christ.  Help me.  Hurry.  Oh, this is worse than a...  It was a tsunami of coffee that swept over my keyboard.  I know.  My hand.  Look at us.  We're so depressed.  There was a tsunami of coffee that hit Anthony.  What do you...  Oh, no.  What do you just do, you ass?  Someone and a paper towel.  What are you doing?  Did that work?  Can you hear me?  What the fuck are you doing?  What do you...  Why'd you...  Why'd you push a button?  Why are you pushing buttons?  No?  Okay.  Is he...  All right.  Why did you tell him to push buttons?  Because there's...  There's...  We're not hearing everything and... 
[00:19:30]  What aren't you hearing?  Mike's not even on.  There was a problem.  You guys didn't notice it, but it would have affected Jim and I and the headphones and we've  been trying to fix it and he was just trying to fix it.  Why is Steve just coming over and just pushing buttons?  Because Ben just told me to do it because I'm on the phone with the engineer right now  and he's saying...  Well, maybe...  This is so not fair.  I have a friggin' phone in one ear.  I have no headphone in the other ear.  He's just yakping away.  I love it.  I love when he talks over it. 
[00:20:00]  We're in the middle of a...  You're the best.  We're in the middle of a good rap about tsunamis and now there's like...  Tsunami.  We're not.  You were cleaning up coffee.  There's coffee all over the place.  Steve is like pushing buttons.  He spilled his coffee.  The buttons you pushed had nothing to do with anything, by the way.  Coffee spiller.  Coffee spiller.  Jesus.  He pushed the buttons on the block.  Oh, it's recording.  What the hell does that mean?  I don't know.  I'm erasing things. 
[00:20:30]  There is coffee now every...  You know something?  That little bit went everywhere.  It sure did.  It sprayed over onto my keyboard.  It was one of those perfect situations where he dropped it and it made a seismic reaction.  All I know is that...  That caused the coffee tsunami.  All I know is Ellen DeGeneres must lick pussy really nice.  Why is that, Opie?  Because they're...  I was reading a magazine before the show.  And she's getting like the hottest bras in Hollywood.  Yeah, she's like the hot leading man now.  All the celebrity girls want to be with her. 
[00:21:00]  She must be very talented.  I know that's a horrendous tangent to go on, but...  My banana's hot.  As I was cleaning up my...  I was sitting on my toasted bagel and now my banana's...  How am I going to eat a hot banana?  Slow.  Slow.  Oh.  Jimmy, could you push the back of my head onto this banana?  No, I jumped on the Ellen DeGeneres thing.  Because I'm trying to clean up coffee and I lifted this thing up and I see Ellen DeGeneres 
[00:21:30]  now with coffee all over her face in the picture.  And they're saying that...  Yeah, she's with another hot Hollywood lesbian starlet.  She's with Portia de Rossi.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, from...  All right.  What the hell's the name of that show now, Ben?  Arrested Development.  Right.  All right, where were we?  Tsunamis.  Yeah, we were talking about how when thousands of brownish emaciated people get killed, it's  not really that big a thing here.  No.  You know, the people of the same ethnic background go crazy here. 
[00:22:00]  But if a hundred people die in a hurricane in the United States, we lose our minds.  We freak out and there are calls for better ways to save more lives when it happens again.  Never mind thousands of people dying, especially from a natural disaster.  It rarely happens here.  We're pretty good with forecasting things where we can get people out of the way of disasters  before they happen.  So you never really see a lot of Americans dying these days of natural disasters.  You know? 
[00:22:30]  But in these other countries, I was just reading, in 1976 in China, 240,000 people died from  an earthquake.  And it didn't even make a dent.  Nah, nah, those Chinese, they just keep banging and making more.  They drew one sketch of the paper and it covered everybody.  This guy died 240,000 times.  They just got a big hose out, hosed it down, and then just moved on.  Oh, as different as little pieces of rice in a huge bowl of it.  Just all the same. 
[00:23:00]  Wow.  Swept out to sea.  All right, we got a tsunami update.  Let's go to John in New York City.  John, what's going on?  What's the worst holiday, bros?  What?  Happy holidays, man.  Happy holidays.  To you and yours, John.  Oh.  Yeah, what day is it?  I want to prove that we're live today, which is so stupid.  27th.  27th of December.  Monday.  Dude, I want to know two things.  First of all, Nate's boyfriend is fucking missing, bro.  What?  Nate's boyfriend is missing. 
[00:23:30]  Who's?  The dude from Oprah.  Oh, oh.  That's right.  He's an interior decorator.  Yeah.  And he survived the whole thing, but he said his friend is missing.  His travel companion.  His travel companion.  If you're an interior decorator and you're traveling to Thailand or somewhere with another  man.  Dude, I'm watching CNN last night.  How did the fuck...  Is the guy missing?  Was it Oedipus?  I was just thinking that they found a wig and a BCN bumper sticker.  Jeez, that's so inside, but very funny. 
[00:24:00]  So his boyfriend is missing?  Yeah, bro.  Well, I wanted to know where I was.  I thought it was fucking nuts.  How the fuck did they find Nate?  I mean, there was like no phone.  There's no television.  There's no radio down there, but how do they find Nate strong on the beach in his fucking  underwear?  They're talking to any white person that weighs more than 102 pounds.  Yeah, they're saving the white people first.  That's how it just goes in the world, unfortunately.  I saw a helicopter rescue, and at the end of the tether, two well-fed white people as 
[00:24:30]  the skinny brown people are just waving at that helicopter, crying, holding up babies,  and there goes the helicopter.  No, we must save this hefty white guy.  Taking the white people like a cow in Apocalypse Now.  Yeah, exactly.  Right out of the rice paddy.  That's so true.  Travis in Idaho, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Idaho, could a tsunami hit your area?  We'll find out at 11. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, man, you know, the thing is, I was watching a little bit of news last night, and they had  like this, you know, they had that like five-second little teaser to come by, right?  Yeah.  And it was like the news lady staring at the camera going, could something happen over  here?  And I don't know.  I wasn't able to catch the newscast, but I'm pretty sure they only spent like...  No, you guys...  In Idaho, I think you guys got to worry about those big serpents that live underground.  Serpents?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Are there serpents? 
[00:25:30]  That's what they have to worry about in Idaho.  Idaho?  Yeah, they got...  You guys got big...  I think the only thing we got to worry about is Mormons.  You guys got big like snake creatures that live under the ground that pop up every once  in a while.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Serpents.  Serpents.  That's what they have to worry about in Idaho.  I thought it was the potato blight.  Anything could happen in Idaho?  Henchman from Brooklyn, what's up, Henchman?  Yeah, not only are tsunamis terrorizing the earth, but there's a 1 in 50 cancer.  That a 400-meter asteroid is going to hit in 2029. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, we've been hearing that one, too.  Yeah, yeah.  They pop that one on the news on a slow news day.  They get the asteroid story that, oh, here it is.  The astronomers are keeping a close eye on this one.  Could it hit?  Look what happened 18 gazillion billion years ago when it did hit.  This could be devastating now.  It could be terrible.  We're all going to die.  I don't know.  I'm a little bit afraid.  All right.  Yeah, it's all about...  The news is all about scaring it.  You know, people...  The only reason the news plays it is because people love stuff like that. 
[00:26:30]  They love to be frightened a little bit.  Also, people would welcome something like that.  As long as it doesn't devastate you, devastation is kind of cool.  Ben, we keeping you awake?  Jesus Christ.  It shakes your life up.  You all right there, Ben?  What?  We're trying to do a...  And then Ben just looks at him.  We're trying to do a show, and it's kind of disheartening to see...  I am yawning.  To see the executive producer go...  Dude, Ben just wrote you off, man.  He looks at you, just snarls, and goes, relax. 
[00:27:00]  Relax.  Obviously, Ben's relaxing right into a coma.  Ben's relaxing.  He doesn't have to pull a radio show out of his ass because there's nothing in front of us to work off.  Except a tsunami story and the fact that Reggie White died.  That's what we got today.  But Ben, the executive producer, is going to sit there and yawn and go, relax.  Oh, you're missing another major story how the Jets got their ass kicked yesterday.  He was very happy again today.  Oh, they got killed.  Pennington stinks.  I cannot stand the streak.  Pennington, first of all, doesn't stink.  I'll acknowledge that the Pats are a better team this year, but the Jets, you know, they're limping toward the playoffs. 
[00:27:30]  By what I said four weeks ago, what about the Bills?  The Bills are the team?  What about the Bills?  I am just annoyed that he is on this sports win streak for months now, Ben.  He is so happy with the goddamn Sox winning, and now the Pats are well on their way to, you know, the Super Bowl.  And he is so happy, and he just represents everyone from Boston right now.  You represent everybody from Boston.  That's right.  Just all cocky and feeling good and yawning. 
[00:28:00]  He shouldn't.  You can't like sports if you can't get an athletic supporter around your big hog.  That should be a rule.  You tape two of them together, don't you, big boy?  It's like a tsunami in his pants.  The Jet fans, though, yesterday, they were all talking trash before the game.  Stinky called me to rouse me, as well as Billy Mac.  Ha, you got five bucks.  They don't pay me.  Well, you know, I mean, what are you going to say?  The Jets, uh...  What was the score?  I didn't see the game at all.  23-7, I think, was the final. 
[00:28:30]  I'm sure Pennington will cry to the media again.  Your Cowboys pulled one out there.  I can't believe...  I actually had more interest in that Jets game.  And I don't really like either team, but I did want to see the Jets beat the Patriots.  And I just forgot all about football yesterday.  I didn't see that.  Yeah, well...  New York just getting spanked by Boston.  Yeah.  It's just, uh...  Over and over again.  It's kind of sad, but it's happening, and I don't know what to do about it.  How about those Giants, huh?  Oh.  They stink.  No one likes them, though.  No.  No one here likes the Giants. 
[00:29:00]  I'm just talking about New York teams.  Yeah.  I've never liked the Giants.  Jimmy's herkeying and jerking as he's talking.  I know, I know.  It's the only way to get back in it.  You know what Ben looks like?  Ben looks like poorly spliced film when he moves.  Wow!  That's poorly spliced film.  That's hilarious.  That's good.  Poorly spliced film.  That's hilarious.  Dude, the Patriots tomorrow, yesterday. 
[00:29:30]  Christ.  Yeah, that's beautiful.  Let's go to John.  Hey, John, what's up?  Jim, they blew it both sides.  Ben.  Wow.  It is not a lot.  He's talking like Ben moves.  What was he trying to say?  The 86 Patriots?  I really don't know.  The phones.  46 to 10.  The phones are 0 for 2.  Yeah, we can't hear you.  Did the, uh, he kept chopping up there.  So.  Man, what's up with the, what do you guys think about Reggie White? 
[00:30:00]  What did he die at?  I heard last night.  They're saying heart attack.  Oh.  Then I heard respiratory failure on, um.  Man, you gotta think.  One of the football games last night.  You gotta, I don't hang with the guy.  I don't know crap, but you gotta think, the freaking steroids are just not a good thing.  You know, who knows if he was taken or not.  43 years old and he's, he's dropping dead.  Yeah.  Who knows if he was taken or not.  But, uh.  I really don't know, but.  You see some of those guys.  Remember Lyle Alzado?  Yeah.  He was taking steroids and he was just a monster of a guy. 
[00:30:30]  And then his last days, we had the Lyle Alzado keep his tumor in his head, bandana around  his head all the time.  And he weighed like 80 pounds.  Looked like one of those Sri Lanka people.  Mm.  This is awful.  These guys take these things and they're huge, uh, but it's like burning the candle  at both ends or something, you know, because they end up, uh, being huge, being all powerful.  And then once that stuff turns on you, oh, you weigh 10 pounds, you got tumors just growing 
[00:31:00]  out of every part of your body.  Not good.  No, who's doing that?  A lot of the wrestlers, man.  They drop dead or they, uh, you know, they get out of wrestling and they wind up getting  these brain tumors.  It's awful.  Ugh.  I saw Lyle Alzado interviewed like right before he died and he sneezed and you could actually  hear the inside of his brain going, ah, sloshing.  Oh, I want to hear how, I want to see how Jambi does this year now that he obviously  can't shoot anymore.  Oh.  But if he starts going, if he bats like 240 and hits like eight home runs by like halfway 
[00:31:30]  through the season, people are going to start throwing things at him.  Who didn't know he was doing them though?  Like who did, anybody, especially if you're in that business where you're around these  guys, you could pick the ones that you know do it and the ones that don't do it.  So it was no surprise, even the people that signed him, you know, they know he's on  the steroids.  He's going to stink.  Oh, he's going to be awful.  Done.  They ought to get rid of him.  Without a doubt.  I almost said you're preaching to the choir and then I realized I would have beverages  from both sides of the room flying at me.  I already did and I didn't say anything. 
[00:32:00]  Don't be through his coffee at me.  It was a tsunami coffee thing.  Tsunami.  Yeah.  How was your Christmas?  Good.  Actually, mine turned out okay.  Yeah.  Considering all the, you know, what we were dealing with this year.  But yeah, it was all right.  It was all right.  I don't think I got any gifts.  Oh, I got a MiFi from the CEO of the company.  Well, everybody got their MiFi.  I think that's all I got this year.  Yeah, that's it.  Who's wearing Christmas clothes?  Anyone? 
[00:32:30]  No?  Some of the interns.  I try to make it a rule not to come in the day after Christmas with the Christmas clothes on.  Because you don't want to be the guy with the brand new Christmas clothes.  Steve's got them on?  No, no.  Does he have any brand new flaming?  Did you see his watch?  No.  He has a flaming watch.  He has a watch that it hits buttons and it flames and shit.  Are you kidding?  Oh, no.  How do you keep his tree from bursting into flames at his house?  He goes to open the gifts and just a fire starts in his living room. 
[00:33:00]  Whenever Steve yawns, it looks like the back of the Batmobile and it accelerates.  Steve, let me see your fire watch.  Fire watch?  Fire watch.  Fire watch has a skull in the middle.  A skull, of course.  You hit the button.  Almost as good as flames.  Exactly.  Wait.  No, no, no.  Wait.  Wait.  Oh, wow.  The back of his watch is lighting up in flame pattern.  That's pretty cool, but there's no numbers on it.  How do you tell if it's 6.30 or 5.38?  It's got an hour hand and a minute hand.  He doesn't care what time it is.  Thank you, Jim.  Now he's going to touch. 
[00:33:30]  He's going to be feeling you up.  He does this thing where he just touches.  I have to have numbers on my watch or I can't function.  I don't know how you do it.  It's cool.  Yeah, it's great.  I like this.  I got the fire watch and the fire boots.  It's absolutely great.  I like it, Steve.  It's on fire.  Look at that.  Yeah, I got new fire boots.  All right.  Let's go to Lori the trucker.  Lori, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to clarify that Reggie White, I'm from Wisconsin.  I really didn't like the implication of steroids, but he actually had a heart attack due to sleep apnea. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah?  In his sleep, really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Sleep apnea, where you stop breathing.  Yep.  Well, we don't know.  We talk out our ass, Lori.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't say that it was steroids.  You get very suspicious, though, that a 43-year-old guy is dropping dead, you know?  Well, no, I agree.  I just, there's an implication put out there, and Reggie White's kind of a beloved character that she's had.  Did he actually die in his sleep?  I mean, I guess you can't know unless you were there. 
[00:34:30]  I wonder if you wake up, because I have sleep apnea, and I wonder if you wake up when you're dying like that,  or if he just died before you wake up.  I imagine he probably died before he woke up.  You stopped breathing.  No, I know.  It's awful.  You just stopped breathing, and then he had a heart attack because he stopped breathing.  No, he seemed to be a great man, a great character, and one of the best in the NFL ever.  Reggie White was an animal.  He really was.  All right.  All right.  I'm out of here.  Thanks for clearing that up for us.  It makes me want to take a deep breath.  I have sleep apnea. 
[00:35:00]  I wake up sometimes, and I'm going, breathe.  Oh, it's horrible, dude.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  I'm going to get my sinuses fixed as soon as the New Year hits.  Yeah, we heard about this at the comedy show at the downtown.  Did it?  We all went, had a great time.  The second show was, they were too rowdy.  They were good, but they were just yelling, Monster Rain!  Long Island guy crowds that you just want to smack in the face sometimes.  I do.  They just yell at them.  What could you possibly do?  There are some hecklers that can almost sense when the comedian can almost use the heckle, 
[00:35:30]  and it gives the comic the chance to work the crowd a little bit and really get at the heckler and stuff.  And if they're clever with something, it kind of, it can work.  But when someone just yells out in the middle of your setup,  Lil' Connor!  Like, what the hell can you do with that?  What does it mean?  It screws your setup up, and you should legally be allowed to smash the Budweiser bottle over his head. 
[00:36:00]  And not to mention, now that you yell that out, I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly.  But yeah, they weren't nasty heckles.  It was stuff like Monster Rain and Lil' Connor and very odd things in the middle of the setups,  which are really, that's the only kind of heckling that's really hard to deal with,  because people are trying to have fun.  So I come downtown, right?  Lil' Connor!  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  What do you say to that? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  That's a really, it was very odd.  Animals!  And it's, it's, I've never, I've never seen a stand-up at the downtown.  I've seen rock bands and stuff like that.  So I don't know, is that the type of kind of crowd that they get usually?  Because there are some clubs that get very classy crowds that really don't, for the most part,  there's always an asshole in there or something like that.  But a place like Caroline's, you go in, the crowd's pretty well-behaved, you know,  you're not going to really see anything like that.  But then you get something like the crowd at the downtown,  where it's just a lot of drunk Long Island guys, you know, 
[00:37:00]  hey, and don't feel bad or try to rag at me, because I was one of you.  Yeah.  Well, they were serving beer by the bucket.  Oh, my God.  They got to get that bar, got to get the bar number.  By the time Norton hit the stage, a lot of these guys had a lot of buckets of beer.  Tanked.  Tanked.  They were great, though, but they're just, they're having fun.  They're just animals.  It's just what they do.  Yeah.  Like, a rock club like that, you're going to get occasionally people yelling out weird stuff.  But it was cool.  I mean, it's like, eh, whatever.  I got a barrel throw.  Monster Rain.  What? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, let's go to Mike from Long Island.  Mike, what's up?  What's happening?  You're at the downtown.  Phenomenal, man.  Great show.  Oh, thanks, Mike.  Norton didn't disappoint at all.  Thank you, buddy.  My buddy was breaking my chops because I look like Voss.  Oh, yeah.  I remember you.  Yeah, it was very funny, man.  I just want to say you guys were so gracious to take time out and have a picture with me  and my wife.  You made her a Christmas.  You made my night, and I can't thank you guys enough.  Oh, we talked about what assholes you were after we left. 
[00:38:00]  You were the tall, you were the guy that was the tall-looking Rich Voss, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, a little heavy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He kind of had the Voss look going, though, on his face.  I have Nathaniel set, too.  I brought whatever the downtown gave me for Nathaniel.  I have to give him.  Oh, cool.  Let's go to Chris from Long Island.  He did a good job, by the way.  Yeah, he's very funny.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, all in a?  Hey.  What's up, beefy kids?  Hey, Chris.  Thanks for calling the program.  What do you say there, brother?  Yeah, that's so funny.  That was my boy.  That looked like Voss.  I was just on the first phone call.  All right. 
[00:38:30]  Nah, I just called to say thank you guys.  You guys were great.  Norton, you're the man.  You're a sick, fucking degenerate, and I love it.  Thank you, man.  Thanks for coming to the show.  Thanks for being as cool as you are.  Take care.  Take care, buddy.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tony and PA.  Tony, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  How you doing?  Hi, Tony.  Hi, Jimmy.  Thanks for calling.  How was your holiday?  It was excellent.  You know, I've got to thank you guys for working today.  This is the first time I've been able to listen to you guys in two and a half years.  I'm so excited.  I got the MiFi yesterday.  Oh, and what do you think of the MiFi so far? 
[00:39:00]  It is absolutely incredible.  Absolutely.  Yeah, right on.  So I'm loving it.  What a great gift.  Who got you that?  My little mommy, yes.  Mommy got you that for a girl.  Wow.  What is mommy rich?  Well, no, not really.  Those things are a little, you know, you got to admit, a little steep.  But you get everything with it, though.  It's like you get the car kit and the whole, it's like phenomenal.  You get like 50 things with it.  You can listen to it in your car, in the house, and just walking around.  It's incredible.  Hey, dude, let me ask you a question.  And this is my only complaint with the MiFi or anything like that.  My earlobes are so small, I can't, I can't use, uh, those. 
[00:39:30]  Can you use those little earplugs?  Will they fit in your ears?  You know, I can't use them.  They're pretty comfortable, actually.  They really are.  I have little stillborn ears, and I can't use anything that's supposed to go in my ears.  They're just a mess.  You can't put the buds from, like, the iPods or the MiFi.  No, absolutely.  It hurts.  Ow, ow.  And it stretches my little ears, and then as soon as I look left, it falls out.  Jim, go out and try.  I think it'll work for you.  Dude, I gotta buy headphones that go over. 
[00:40:00]  Have you ever seen my headset for the car?  You need the big Starsky and Hutch headphones with the antennas coming off?  It's awful.  I have the one on top of my head with the little mouthpiece for the car.  I can't.  I look like an ass, but I can't wear anything in my ears.  That's hilarious.  I can't do it.  You got problems.  I have little ears.  Little ears.  They're like little chimpanzee ears.  I was distracted because the news is doing their storm watch coverage for the people in the rest of the country.  New York got, I don't know, maybe two inches in the city.  Maybe. 
[00:40:30]  Maybe.  It's like a dusting in the city.  A dusting in the city, and then in the suburbs, it's a little more.  But they got reporters all over the place reporting on this stupid snowstorm, and it was nothing.  They now have a reporter talking in the middle of wherever, and the street behind him is perfectly clear.  So what does he have to report?  Nothing.  And then they showed another reporter that was actually on her knees pointing at the snow, and it couldn't have been more than an inch high.  Like she's got to point it out.  Oh, there they go.  Yeah, let the Midwest talk about some snow. 
[00:41:00]  They got like serious snow over the weekend.  This is nothing.  They love making a big deal out of nothing on the news.  Yeah, they got to kick it into a pile.  They're kicking snow into a pile like, look how much snow we got.  Weren't there people like in the Midwest stuck in the airport for Christmas?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it stinks.  Stuck in their cars.  It came down like 31 inches in no time.  Good thing going to Vegas we're actually stopping in Cleveland because they don't get any snow in January.  Oh, brother.  I got to stop in Salt Lake. 
[00:41:30]  Because apparently, this show, we're taking 18 different aircraft to Vegas.  That's great.  I read the itinerary.  Somehow, Jimmy's on a B-17, and I'm in a P-51 Mustang.  I don't know how that happened, but I'm going to be strafing the crowds in Vegas.  They had your wrong airline listed.  They had me on Continental, and apparently I'm flying Delta.  I recognize the hub.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I went to the website, and I said, I go, let me look up my flight. 
[00:42:00]  I want to see what kind of equipment I'll be taking, whatever.  And there's no flight for me.  I put in the flight number.  No, Continental doesn't have.  Here's the people being washed away, by the way.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  There's people being washed away.  Why do they show it so quick?  Why do they deny what we want to see, as awful as it is?  I don't know.  I completely distracted myself with the Sri Lanka people.  Where the hell was I?  It's amazing. 
[00:42:30]  We're complaining about our problems, and we see people being washed away.  They're dead.  That's what we started the show with.  I know.  We're awful.  We just live a different life, us Americans.  Wow.  Look at that.  Oh, look at these dead people.  Wow.  Now they're starting to get really good video.  Look at that guy didn't make it, and that guy did.  Holy S.  Just swept off the road that they were trying to run down.  But those people might not have been killed, because they might not have been swept back  into the ocean, right?  Stop.  Dead.  All right.  Look at me.  Pete positive spin.  Pete positive.  I think he's okay. 
[00:43:00]  He looked fine to me, as he was kind of being toppled into the waves.  He was treading water.  Yeah, here they are bringing him to the hospital, I'm sure, wrapped in that blanket.  What a mess.  How many teen hookers died in that?  Oh, how awful.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, they set us up, so I go to check, and I go to Jimmy, I go, Continental doesn't  even fly on the day that they say they're flying us to Vegas, doesn't even fly to Vegas.  I go, I'm flying into Salt Lake City first, and then taking another plane to Vegas.  And Jimmy goes, oh, that's the hub for Delta. 
[00:43:30]  Like, he knows.  Yeah.  Hopefully your luggage will arrive in Vegas.  Oh, please.  I think I'm just going to take everything I carry on.  They just stink in Washington as far as planning trips.  They just do it, and they're pissed off at Club Soda Kenny, because Club Soda Kenny, he  works for the Opie and Anthony show, and he's looking out for us.  Simple as that.  We're his number one priority, but for some reason in Washington, they're all pissed off  at Club Soda Kenny, because he's trying to do the right thing.  These people down in Washington, it's ridiculous.  We knew we were going to Vegas a month ago, and they're making excuses why they couldn't 
[00:44:00]  book the trip ahead of time.  Oh, they're pissed off at the letters now.  Kenny's letters are getting worse.  They're like the Zodiac Killer's letters to the newspaper now.  They're just these rambling messes that make you angry.  Did we have them saved at all?  Those are the best emails there.  I really thought.  But I say good.  I want this guy to be a pain in their ass, because, look, I know XM doesn't like us complaining,  and we haven't complained in a while about, you know, especially equipment.  They've done a great job.  Blah, blah, blah.  As far as this Vegas trip goes, they have screwed the pooch more and worse than anywhere I've 
[00:44:30]  ever worked to get us from point A to point B.  I don't care what excuses they're giving why this had to be planned so late.  We knew CES.  That doesn't wash.  We knew when CES was.  So you book the trip a month in advance, and God forbid we're there a day early, we'll  make something out of it.  Right.  You know, but they're saying, well, we couldn't book the trip because we weren't sure if you  guys were broadcasting on a Tuesday or a Wednesday or a Friday.  Bullshit.  Shut the fuck up.  Book the thing. 
[00:45:00]  Trust me.  I'm talking to Eric Logan either today or tomorrow, and for now on, Club Soda Candy takes care  of everything for us, like it or not.  Because you know what?  I know what it is.  With XM Satellite Radio, it's an absolutely huge company.  There's a whole bunch of things going on in marketing and programming.  So we're just a tiny little piece of the pie.  And they put it off and put it off and put it off.  No one's really looking out for us as the number one priority, but if we have someone like  Club Soda Candy, he will make sure that things are done the right way.  Right.  There's no reason in the world that we should have connecting flights to go to Vegas. 
[00:45:30]  No!  Stop!  And we're all on different flights!  I thought we'd all be sitting together and laughing and goofing.  That's how we should be going.  And we were warning them, you know, a month out, look, we have to book this.  We have to, you know, all the hotel rooms are going to be taken.  You know, the flights are being booked.  I look forward to tipping some Bloody Marys with Ben on the plane.  That's fun stuff.  Watching him get flagged.  Right.  How great would that be?  I do get nailed every time. 
[00:46:00]  I need to take the dump on the dessert cart.  But, you know, we gave him a chance.  Ben Sparks, alias Old Gravy Leg.  We gave him a chance.  We gave him enough rope and they hung themselves.  So, for now on, Club Soda Candy takes care of all travel arrangements for the show.  Tough crap.  Yep.  You're barely paying the guy anything and the guy is working his ass off for the show.  So, deal with his stupid emails and do the right thing.  Because I don't want to deal with this crap again.  They have screwed this up so much.  And I send an email and go, excuse me, what airline am I taking? 
[00:46:30]  And I knew I was taking Delta because Jimmy told me.  But they had no clue.  What airline?  Oh, it's because of the excuses that come out make me sick.  And they're bull.  Kenny toured with Andrew Dice Clay for 12 years.  He knows how to book flights.  He knows how to get hotels.  He knows all that crap.  You think Dice had a date connecting flights anywhere?  Dude, he had.  Kenny had.  When I first started touring with Dice, Kenny had every one of our flights coordinated.  Hotels, car pickups.  He is an obsessive compulsive disorder, travel arranging psychopath. 
[00:47:00]  And he's always right when he comes to that kind of stuff.  But XM books this last minute.  So, now we're on a few different flights.  18 flights.  Where we have connections in areas that are in the middle of winter.  And I think we're staying at a Days Inn.  I've never heard of this place.  When you go to Vegas as a show for something, don't you want to say you're staying at the Bellagio?  Or something?  Or the Hard Rock over there?  Or something?  And I'm sure we could have got a much nicer hotel if we booked this a month out. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  There aren't any rooms left is why.  CES and the Adult Awards.  Of course.  It's booked up well in advance.  But not so far in advance that we couldn't have gotten something if we would have jumped on this sooner.  But they didn't.  So now.  Because we're not a priority.  Well, you know, Kenny will make us a priority.  And Kenny will take care of this crap.  He doesn't have anything else to do.  Deal with that big stupid retard now.  Now you deal with him.  I'll talk to Eric Logan.  And I'll get it all taken care of because, you know, it's just BS. 
[00:48:00]  It's just BS.  The emails, though, from Kenny were priceless.  He's all upset about you guys.  You guys are big celebrities in the rooms that you're staying in.  And Kenny now also emails down there.  Whenever he's on HBO, he sends mass emails to XM.  Wants to let him know.  Oh, it's hilarious.  How can they not see the beauty of Kenny's emails?  I just giggle reading them.  They're long.  They're great.  And I don't want to overstate.  You can just hear his voice as he's typing. 
[00:48:30]  That droning monotone.  They don't want to deal with Kenny, but tough, tough shit, man.  That's what you get.  Now that's what you get.  Because, quite frankly, you've screwed up.  This trip is a disaster.  You had your chance.  You blew it.  Now you have to deal with Muldoon and his 40-page emails.  That's what you get.  And he's right.  He is right.  You know, I can see if Kenny was incompetent, but you know what?  He books.  He knows what he's doing.  Yep.  And he's a black belt. 
[00:49:00]  Let's go to Peter on Long Island.  Peter, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  I love the set.  I saw Jimmy at Farmingdale.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thanks for coming.  Yeah, thank you, Buttercup.  I also have sleep apnea, and I'm alive.  Oh, wait.  You have sleep apnea?  Yes, I do.  And what?  You wake up in the middle of the night because you know you're not breathing?  No.  What I do is I went for some sleep tests, and I now wear a mask at night to sleep.  And the mask puts about one pound of pressure.  It's called a BiPAP machine.  It feels the beat of your breathing. 
[00:49:30]  The second you stop, it pops some air and dopes up the passengers, and you breathe all night.  Dude, my father sleeps with that.  My mother actually had to sleep in the other room because my dad wears his mask.  It's like an aqua lung.  Yeah.  It pushes air in.  That's got to make for a great sex life, man.  Oh, it's got to be awful.  Jesus.  She's banging the creature from the Black Lagoon.  What?  I'm some look.  I put the headphones on.  I'm some.  I'm some ONA repeats all night with the mask on.  Are you married, though?  You know who I am.  I'm the cleaning guy.  Oh, you.  Hey. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, hi.  You're the guy that brings in all those hand products.  I gave it a sanitizer.  I'm the skinny guy.  Okay.  You're getting close to being a stalker, bro.  Oh, no.  Let's calm down with the cleaning products.  We get it.  All right?  Jesus.  You've got to shake people's hands.  We're getting discussed.  All right.  We get it.  But you're showing up everywhere with little, like, Purell things.  Yeah.  All right.  We get it.  Remember me?  I won't show up anymore.  Okay.  No, you can show up.  We don't mind.  Look at him.  Don't be all wounded or all.  I won't be a fan.  It's okay.  I'll stop coming.  It's all right.  Don't be like that.  I'd love to pinch that little oxygen thing.  Kink your hose. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I'll put a little kink in your hose once you wake up panicking.  Is that a problem?  Spray Purell in your eye.  You've got to think wearing a wacky mask to bed really messes up the sex life.  You've got to think.  You do your business ahead of time.  You don't get any surprises.  You do your business ahead of time.  There's a lot of stuff people wear to bed that's just got to mess up the sex life.  Well, you know what?  It's like either living or dying or maybe getting some action once in a while.  You make your pick.  I thought of you guys at my parents' house for Christmas.  Thanks, Peter.  The very Brady Christmas was on from 88. 
[00:51:00]  And it was just so funny because Peter and Bobby were sharing the living room.  And Peter had on a nightshirt.  I'm like, who wears whoever in this, at least from like after 1850, has worn a nightshirt.  A nightshirt.  And you can't look at Robert Reed, do anything without noticing how gay he is now.  The hand on the hip.  Very gay.  The left hand being this while the right arm is akimbo on the hip.  You cannot notice.  Peter! 
[00:51:30]  Peter!  Why don't you slip this sexy little nightshirt on, Peter?  Because it's no fun unless I can pull something up in the back.  That's why all the Brady boys wear the nightshirts.  He just gave up acting straight.  Because I think in the original series, I don't think you can tell at all, but you're right.  These later episodes and specials that came out.  He just said, ah, screw it.  I am what I am and here it is.  Those scenes where he's laying in bed with Carol at the end of the show. 
[00:52:00]  Doing the little show closer.  And they have to make like they're a loving married couple.  It's like, oh my.  Oh, Carol.  Come here.  Let me give you a kiss, I guess.  I can smell that vagina from up here.  Eww.  Mind if I sleep in the boys' room tonight, Carol? 
[00:52:30]  Greg, do you think I could shove that big horse sculpture at the bottom of the stairs up my ass?  Let's try.  There's one scene where one of the Brady kids, like one of their kids, like whether it was Marsh's little eight-year-old red-headed son,  slid down the banister and Robert Reed was at the bottom to catch him.  I'll catch you.  Come on down.  Oh, he's coming so fast.  And so am I.  Oh, yeah.  I love those boys. 
[00:53:00]  Stupid.  Girls, you okay?  All right, good night.  Hi, boys.  Let me tuck in and read you a little story.  Once upon a time, there was a homosexual actor playing a dad.  Well, I understand that he would molest Bobby and Greg, but he wouldn't molest Peter because Peter wasn't mechanically inclined.  Peter, why don't you put on the Phil Packer mustache you wore in episode 33?  And, you know, I'm going to tickle my little member down here with that mustache. 
[00:53:30]  Ooh.  All right, boys, we're going to play Steal the Playbook.  I put it in my pants.  Now, you boys got to steal it so Greg can read the plays.  Ooh.  I've rolled up these plants and put them in this tube.  Now, you've got to hide them in me. 
[00:54:00]  All right, we can clear the phone lines.  We should take a quick break.  Clear the phone.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  I got that for Christmas, by the way.  Oh, you did.  The Money Mooners original 39 episodes right to the $99,000 answer.  Captain Video.  Nothing but laugh riot.  Oh, dude.  Awesome.  All right, a little ditty from Stephen Lynch, and we'll continue.  Hush, little girl. 
[00:54:30]  Sweet, sweet baby, don't cry tonight.  Daddy's here, and he'll sing you a soft lullaby tonight.  Why can't it all be like it was before?  How can I explain why Mommy's not here anymore? 
[00:55:00]  Cause Daddy likes porno and $10 whores.  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores.  Daddy likes robbing against little boys on the bus.  I think that's why your mommy left us. 
[00:55:30]  Hush, little girl.  There is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke.  Daddy just wants to forget tonight.  Soon it will all be like it was before. 
[00:56:00]  Any minute she will walk through that front door.  But Daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer.  Then he wants sex that involves Mommy's rear.  Daddy has sores on his genitals, oozing with pus. 
[00:56:30]  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Please don't cry.  I swear I'll try to be here by your side.  Right after Daddy gets home from the bar, 
[00:57:00]  visits his boogie and steals a new car,  he'll drive to the strip club.  And if Daddy plays his cards right,  he'll bring home your new mommy tonight.  La-dee-dai, la-dee-dai-dai-dee-dai-dee-dai.  La-dee-dai, la-dee-dai-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  La-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  La-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee. 
[00:57:30]  What is this?  Alright, what's the problem?  Oh boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis. 
[00:58:00]  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  What's going against the wall?  I'm not going against the wall.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  This holiday season, what are you giving your sports fanatical dad?

Are you breathing?  That's terrific  That's terrific  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program  We like to call it the ONA virus 
[01:03:30]  Spreading across America  Like a tsunami  Want to say hi to everyone that got  XM satellite radios for Christmas  Ooh  Did you get yours?  Hearing from a lot of people this morning  That it, you know, got the  Got the MiFi or some other XM satellite radio  And they turned it on  And they're hearing us for the first time, Anthony  So welcome to the ONA virus  Welcome  I saw a few over at Grandma's house  Went to have Christmas there  Like we do every year 
[01:04:00]  And saw a couple of satellite units  Being given as gifts  Not by me  It was one of the hottest gifts this year  So  Yeah  Someone gave my mommy  I think it was my sister  Gave my mommy the home hookup kit  So she can now take it from her car  Into the house and listen all the time  Great  That's a great gift  Great  Because  So far she hasn't really heard us  Goofing on her that much  But  Goofing on her singing 
[01:04:30]  We've lucked out  Yeah  In that regard, right?  Now she'll be able to listen all the time  Oh good  And Jimmy, you went home for Christmas, huh?  I, yes  I had a good time  I saw my mom and dad  And my sister and stuff  It was cool  And it was a really lovely day  Filled with cold ham and sweaters  And avoided eye contact  And how many questions can I get about this radio show?  I'm at the table  My parents moved into a new place  Yeah  Hey, show me around  And there's an  The tour  The little tour  Let me give you the tour 
[01:05:00]  And here's the sink  You know, which I'm sure would have interested Fat Bob Kelly if he was along  And we're all sitting in the little area  And there's like an uncomfortable  I can't describe it  It was like something  It was like a  The smell of something that had been cooked  There was something there  You can't quite describe what it was  But it was a vibe  And my mom goes  Jimmy, we want to ask you  And my father gives her the look  There was an unspoken thing between them  Oh, no  Like, don't ask  And she looks at him  And he looks at her  And she stops talking 
[01:05:30]  I'm like, go ahead  What, ma?  It's fine  And she's like  You don't really want people to go doo-doo on you  Do you?  Is that how she said it?  She said the words  Doo-doo  Doo-doo  Doo-doo  That was my Christmas  And how did you answer that, Jimmy?  Well, I mean, look  What am I supposed to say?  You know, well, depends on consistency, Ma  How do you get out of something like that?  I told my mother truthfully  That I certainly do not enjoy that activity  Of course  And it's just for the radio show, right? 
[01:06:00]  Yes  Absolutely  Wink, wink  Nudge, nudge  Right  Oh, I was that uncomfortable  I was tired  You know, Mom  We have to fill up four hours of radio every day  So we kind of  How many times have you had that conversation?  How low on the list do you have to go, though?  Where you're coming up with crapping on you stories  Mom, it was a slow news day  So we'd figure we would start the scenario  That I'd like to get crapped on  Yeah, I figure  Apparently I have to fill up a lot of time in my private life  At three in the morning in my apartment, too  When I'm putting bags down 
[01:06:30]  You know, Mom, I get bored in the apartment  I gotta fill up time  I don't understand why you don't go home  And see your folks that often  I love seeing my parents  No, I know  And they're great people  But you just want to avoid conversations like that  Maybe a little advice to your parents  They listen every day  Just don't ask Jimmy any questions  It'll come around a little more  No questions  And just keep it in your head that  No, he doesn't do those things  Anything that you hear  That you really aren't happy with  With your son  He's not really doing  Right  And just keep that in your mind 
[01:07:00]  And everything will be fine  Jimmy's a good boy  Right  Look at him  He stays out of trouble  He's self-sufficient  Yes  It's almost like I'm talking about a Mongol  I was just thinking that  Because I am 36  If I was 19  You might go  That's pretty impressive  But I have been a legal voter for 18 years  Oh  He's a self-sufficient boy  Look at him  He fits in with society  Sorta  He's good  He can work at a Burger King  You just can't wear earbuds  Yeah 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my rotten little ears  No, I can't  It's hilarious  But it was nice  A lot of sweaters  Which I always enjoy  Sweaters you got  Which I need many of  I always need eight or nine  New sweaters a year  Oh  You do  How many sweaters did you get?  A lot  You get a lot of sweaters  Yes, it was the  If you're a fat girl  1988 collection  Oh, God  I didn't even think of that  Because I didn't get many sweaters  I got some sweaters  But I also got like  You know  Button-down shirts and stuff  And pants  Van Heusen  Van Heusen 
[01:08:00]  And I got some slacks  That's funny  I got some slacks  But, you know  Jim  It might be saying something  If they get you sweaters  That, you know  That's the easiest  Kind of fashion  To buy for you  Absolutely  They don't know  She said I'm a hard guy  To buy for me  They always get me  Like little comedy books  Which are fun  Like about laughter  And the George Carlin calendar  They got me  Which is really cool  And I'm sure I'll keep that  Until about January 11th  And then I'll realize  I'm clogging my desk  Oh, it's one of those 
[01:08:30]  A joke a day  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Unfortunately  Yeah, those are fun  For about two weeks  I got a George Carlin book  Oh, did you?  I got his book  The one about  Braindroppings?  No, Christ and the Porkchops  Oh, I didn't see that one  The title of that one  It'll probably be  Great toilet reading  I know, exactly  You put it in the bathroom  Every so often  You're taking a dump  You open that thing right up  Phenomenal  If you're Ben, of course  You get chapters one through seven  In one sitting  Ben, where's war and peace?  I put it back  I'm finished  The Tales of Old Gravy Leg 
[01:09:00]  Ben  Speaking of Ben and Christmas  He almost spent Christmas  With our new pal  Bernie Goetz  Yes, I hear you two  Are sparking up  Quite the little friendship  Bernie Goetz  The subway vigilante  We found out after the fact  He was on our show last week  That he was here  The day after  The 20th anniversary  Of him, you know  Shooting those four utes  You want to read the  No, you can read it  Ben got an email  Oh, that's one of many  I just  Well, Ben called me  All excited  I'm not really that excited  Excited and horrified  At the same time 
[01:09:30]  Saying, Bernie Goetz  Is now my new best friend  He's calling me like crazy  He wants me to go to his apartment  And smoke pot  Why wouldn't you want to party with Bernie?  Jim thinks I should  I just  You should hang with him  I don't smoke pot  I wouldn't smoke pot with him  But I'd hang with him  You should definitely go over  And see what his apartment's like  Okay  I'll give him your number  Dude, I'll go over there in a second  Jim, you want to go to  Bernie Goetz's apartment?  More than I want to do anything  You can see his little squirrel  I'll go there today  His pet squirrel  The guy had squirrels in his apartment  That he was raising  Here's the email  He's a nut 
[01:10:00]  Very short  That's one of many  If you want  On the next interview  I can bring some music suggestions  I can also look at your music library  And pick out some music  Either just before the interview  Or at some other time  Prior to the interview  Bernie Goetz  Wants to now program music  Program music for the show  We should allow him  To program a half hour of music  And let him DJ  Wouldn't that be great?  Can we get him on the phone today?  Yeah, probably not yet  But yeah  When he wakes up  You don't want to wake him  How great is it?  Let him DJ  Let him DJ  Let him DJ for a half hour 
[01:10:30]  The Bernie Goetz show  The last half hour before the show you think?  Like that replays doesn't it?  Like later in the day?  Whatever  A half hour during our show  We'll just sit here and watch him  Let him roll  He'll be sitting there  With his CDs perfectly lined up  Because he's an OCD freak  He'll fan them out  Like every little bottom corner touching  Oh yes  And then he'll talk in between  Yeah  He'll talk up the records  Which means he'll probably  Get to play two records in an hour  He'll miss the post by eight minutes  Right  Song's over as he's trying to introduce it 
[01:11:00]  What an awful man  Oh he's the best  He just  He can't stay focused on any one subject  He just babbles and babbles  I listened to that by the way in the car  And that was  Like when you're sitting here  You're like  Ah the listeners are probably  Like ready to hang them  Not you know  Because he's just rambling about everything  Yeah  And then you listen to it  And you're like  That was pretty interesting  It was just an odd  To listen to somebody  Just kind of go all over the place  That's what I listened to  I listened to the playback on that one too  And that's what I was thinking  Like as you're sitting there  Staring at him  Looking at the clock  And just going  Oh my god shut up 
[01:11:30]  It's one thing  But listening to it  As you're driving  It was pretty fascinating stuff  Especially when he told the story  About the shooting and everything  The targets  Just kind of keeping him in that  On track  Was a little difficult  But  And Barry Allen was very fast  I was very proud of that shot  But he wouldn't look at anybody  In the studio  I know  He was kind of looking at someone  Kind of looking down  He goes you know  I don't want to sound like I'm bragging  But the second shot  Was a great shot  Fantastic shot  We got a lot of complaints  From our black listeners  Saying that we were playing 
[01:12:00]  Too many racist songs  Last week  And you know  Some of the listeners  Just don't get it  They just don't get it  They thought we were just  Playing racist songs  For the hell of it  We were playing  Black racist songs  While Bernie was on the show  Because I was basically  Saying that  This guy is really racist  There was a reason for it  But I don't think he is  Without a doubt  That guy hates black people  You think?  Hates them  Wow  I thought you know  He just was  In a situation  Where he was threatened 
[01:12:30]  And it could have been anybody  White, black  Not at all  That guy is definitely a racist  There's no doubt in my mind  Huh  No doubt  So I was playing some racist songs  But the listeners don't get it  They think we were just  Playing racist songs  For the hell of it  Were they listening to the show?  They don't get  How it fit in  With what they were doing  At that moment  Every little thing fits  On this show  Somehow  Some way  There's a little ulterior motive  To playing or doing something  Right  And the Panzerfaust stuff 
[01:13:00]  It was like  You know you're just playing it  Because it was sent in  It's different  You send in like  Anti-white songs  We'll play them in a second  Anything that's interesting  Like that  That's horrible  We would play it  Of course  If it was Jew kill songs  Or white people devils  Send it in  Well those same black people  Didn't acknowledge  When we were playing  Kill Whitey  On the same show  Kill Whitey  That one sticks in your head  Like unbelievable  You are a jerk  You are a scallywag  Scallywag  Kill Whitey 
[01:13:30]  Here's for all our brown listeners  That are pissed off  For playing too many  Hateful black songs  We played this on the same exact show  Yeah  Don't sweat it  I actually love this thing  As Ben said to  Opie earlier in the show  Relax  Ben really did  Big yawn  Yeah the executive producer  Is yawning  As we're like  Trying to pull another radio show  Out of our asses  And when we run out of material  Guess what 
[01:14:00]  I'm walking off the show  I'll turn the mic on  We'll see what you can do Ben  Under this pressure  I'll play music  It's gonna be the past two hours  Yeah we'll talk about the past  Wesley Willis  Let me hear Kill Whitey  It'll stick in everyone's head  You are no good  You are a fucking asshole  You are a real jerk  You are a miserable creep  Kill Whitey  Kill Whitey  Kill Whitey 
[01:14:30]  Kill Whitey  You are full of shit  You are a no good  Right fuck  You are a good  For nothing  Scatty wave  You bring me  Damaging disharmony  In my life  By cussing at me  For no reason  At all  Kill Whitey  Kill Whitey  Kill Whitey 
[01:15:00]  Kill Whitey  Kill Whitey  I am so bad  Oh, my God. 
[01:15:30]  Is this going to go on forever?  Shut this.  All right, there you go.  That's a taste of Wesley Willis doing Kill Whitey.  By the way, I went to open up my club zone to look again.  Right on the helmet.  It's just I always get the water right on my crotch when I'm wearing light pants,  and it looks like I wet myself.  Khaki slacks.  Yes, my khaki slacks.  Not a Christmas present, though. 
[01:16:00]  I gave out cash this year.  Usually every year.  I've talked about it in the past.  I try to do a little shopping.  You go out and try to figure what everybody would like, and it just takes weeks.  It takes weeks.  And you end up spending the last few days in these crowded malls going apeshit trying to  find something for an uncle.  You know?  Go ahead.  It's just a pain in the ass.  You just brought up something.  We had Christmas, and we were all handing out gift cards to everyone, and they were 
[01:16:30]  kind of canceling each other out.  It's like, why bother?  It is.  I got a $50 gift card for Best Buy, and I ended up giving a $50 to this guy.  It's like the end of the night of a poker game.  You go, hey, I'm up.  This guy's up like $10.  I'm down $10.  It's the same crap, you know?  It really is.  I gave away the gift cards this year, and just handed them out.  And then with the youngins in our family, we got a couple of guys that are like 18, I 
[01:17:00]  guess, and 16, something like that.  You just give them cash.  And the one that's 18 goes, oh, good.  I could get some pot.  He's going to buy pot.  With your Christmas gift.  Yeah, with the money that I gave him.  Nothing wrong with that.  Buying pot with Christmas money.  Why not?  Because, I don't know, I kind of remember him when he was really, really young.  You know, and I don't know if I'm too cool with him buying pot with my money. 
[01:17:30]  I kind of feel bad, you know?  He contributed, because I know this kid's like, he's just like me and my brother were  at that age.  He's out every weekend, drinking with your friends, smoking pot.  So what did you think he was going to do with the money?  Run down to, you know, the video store and get the half-life or something?  That's kind of what he did a few years ago when I used to give him, you know, cash.  But you know he's going out and stuff.  Of course he's going to get some drugs.  Now it's about, you know, picking up the dope and the beers and going out. 
[01:18:00]  And then I'm hearing him tell stories at the table, a bit of a lean over so his parents  don't hear.  And he's telling me about, you know, how he's with his friends and they're hammered and  they're driving down the road and they get pulled over and, you know, the cop is searching  and finds bags of pot.  And it's like, holy jeez, what happened?  There's that weird couple of years that go by where they're like, hey, oh, you got me  PlayStation.  Thank you.  To there I was, you know, with my hands against the cop car and I'm getting frizzed. 
[01:18:30]  I was like, wait, this was like two years.  We were working and we got fired.  We were off two years.  And in that two years, all of a sudden now you're like a maniac.  He grew up.  He did.  He grew up.  They tend to do that.  Let's say hi to Stephen Maine.  Hey, Steve.  Hey there.  How are you?  Good.  Hello.  Hey, Sugar Balls.  Hello, Angel.  Thanks for calling the program and the holiday season.  Yeah.  Hey, I was thinking about Bernie Getz and what a visionary he was because remember he was talking  about each black guy that he shot, there was like this little bar that showed up in the 
[01:19:00]  corner of his eye.  Right.  It's like a cell phone.  20 years before cell phones.  He was getting four bars on a subway.  Wow.  That never happened.  I got to punch out.  I'm down to one dead black guy.  All right.  All right.  You know, that's inappropriate and awful, but.  And they didn't die.  What's going on with the cell phones?  You were telling me that.  Now we got to worry, Opie, about viruses.  I've been reading over the.  Yeah.  On our cell phone? 
[01:19:30]  Viruses on your cell phone.  Because what it amounts to is it's a computer program.  It's on your phone, but it's a program.  And they are vulnerable to viruses.  So now they're checking out in the labs these viruses that kind of they're getting some  talk that these things will be hitting phones soon.  So they're testing them out and trying to come up with ways to combat it.  But there are viruses that are out there that could hurt your phone, can erase your phone  book, just erase the capability for it to even work. 
[01:20:00]  And there's one called skulls, where instead of phone numbers coming up and stuff on your  little screen, it just skulls come up and that's it.  You can't use your phone.  You get that now when you're on your computer, using it as like a little, like, you know,  you're on your phone, you can go online.  Yeah.  Is that how you get the virus or do you get it just from talking?  You could get it just from talking.  Someone can call you.  We are just living with a bunch of asses.  There are just a bunch of asses out there that are doing this stuff. 
[01:20:30]  They're just miserable to be alive, so they just want to ruin it for everybody else.  Any convenience that we as human beings come up with is twisted and perverted by a few  asses and just makes it a pain in the ass to use.  Email is a prime example.  How great is email?  You know, no more, you used to have to send paper letters to people.  It was insane.  And then email.  Great.  And then occasionally you'd get this email and go, what is this?  I didn't write this person. 
[01:21:00]  Why is he writing me back or something?  And could you make it a little more interesting?  Our executive producer is still yawning.  Ben, was that a yawn?  Another yawn?  It was a belly yawn.  You're not sure what it is?  You realize it's an ad for melatonin.  There you go.  Tying it right in.  And then he's our barometer today, so maybe you want to make it more interesting.  Maybe this should be a few laughs in there.  I don't know. 
[01:21:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony morning show.  Wake up, Ben.  So go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Huh?  What?  Well, he's distracting when he's yawning.  He really, truly is.  Thank you.  You've completely derailed me again.  Yeah.  I've been derailed.  No, you were talking about email.  Yes.  And spam and all that, right?  And now, you know, you check your email, and it's, for every email I get, on my personal 
[01:22:00]  email account, I get about 75 junk mails, which they figured out a way to put it in the  bulk folder.  Stuff your junk mail goes in there.  But the fact of the matter is, you're still getting that many.  And it's just the same.  Thank you very much for being concerned about my cock.  Thank you.  But I don't need it any bigger.  I'm pretty happy with it.  I wish I could just put out a mass email to all these people.  Thank you.  I'm happy with my cock.  Yeah, thanks for your concern, but it's big enough. 
[01:22:30]  Love, Anthony.  Now you're going to start getting one.  Stop spilling seltzer on your cock.  Mass emails.  Keep that mule dry.  Seltzer on your cock?  Question mark?  And now they get all clever with the, you know, R-E.  You know, like they're replying to something you wrote.  And then there's hugs and kisses sometimes, where it's like a girl.  And you don't know what to do.  I'm trying to get my email up just in the last hour to show you what has come in. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  But I don't know.  See what junk you get.  It's strangely enraging when you get crap.  I don't know why it makes you so...  Stop forwarding things.  Whenever I see FWD, delete.  I don't read them ever.  Don't even read them.  Don't read this.  No.  No.  Delete.  It's awful.  And now they're talking about your phone.  Imagine now getting this in your text messages, where every few minutes,  bling, bling, bling, you're getting these messages that are just spam. 
[01:23:30]  Hey, Viagra.  Hey, how's your cock?  Hey, you need a mortgage?  Hey.  I don't know how long that will last.  People start throwing their phones.  I know.  But it goes on with your email.  Yeah, but in the email, though, you can kind of, as annoying as it is, you can at least  be online without dealing with your email.  You can, but on a phone where it's vibrating and you're constantly...  I know.  Look, oh.  Could you imagine that with just ads for garbage and mortgages and...  All right, here we go.  Isn't it all mortgages? 
[01:24:00]  Yep.  Hard-ons and chicks?  Yep.  Here we go.  Oh, let's see what else it is.  In the last hour, pharmacy for your needs.  That's Viagra.  Well, let's see which one this is.  Viagra, Prozac, Xanax, Cialis, and many more.  All in one pill?  All in one pill.  All right.  Let's see what else.  Oh, here's a chick that wants to get with me.  Ooh.  Oh, and those are fun, too.  Hey, let me know what's going on, Courtney.  Oh, and then you click on it because the subject is, hey, let me know what's going on. 
[01:24:30]  And it's the directory of unfaithful wives in your area.  How did Courtney know to contact you, Opie?  Hey, no.  Catherine with the subject line, incredible and true.  Oh, so now you've got to read it.  You will not find it cheaper anywhere on the web, guaranteed.  And it's another dick pill.  Ah.  Let's see what else.  Just in case you're happy with your cock?  New product.  Cialis Soft Tabs.  Ooh.  I'm actually interested in that.  What does that say?  Soft Tabs?  Yeah.  What are they?  By the way, I am seconds away from breaking this monitor. 
[01:25:00]  Why?  Dude, I'm wondering if it's the, you need a mouse pad.  I think you need a mouse pad.  No, no.  It's clicking on stuff that I'm not even clicking.  Oh, mine does that, too.  I've just gotten used to it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, for some reason, the mice that we have on these computers, they don't work.  Well, there goes that bit because it's just popping around.  Oh, boy.  You saw that, right?  Oh, settle down.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus. 
[01:25:30]  Look at those monitors now.  They're all askew.  Broken monitor.  Well, now we know it'll get fixed.  They're all askew.  I feel like some kind of a...  Uh-oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Just don't break it.  You can't break it.  We need it.  But that does...  I think a mouse.  I've been saying for six months to someone get Opie a mouse.  That might help, as annoying as it sounds, because I had the same problem on these hard  surfaces.  And a mouse...  Oh, it does it with yours, too?  Yeah.  Do you have a mouse?  I have a mouse pad.  Theory gone?  It does it with mine, too.  Hey, Ben, could you, in between yawns, is there a mouse for Opie? 
[01:26:00]  No, it's been happening.  You know the arrow, obviously?  It's just, like, moving around the screen on its own.  It moves around.  It clicks on things.  And then it starts clicking.  And no, we don't have to download drivers.  Shut up.  Mine does that, too, though.  It'll just float once in a while.  It's a floating mouse, and I don't know what it is.  See?  I can't even use that screen today.  Whatever.  So do you have to press a button to get to the other screen, Opie?  Why is there a...  Look at it.  He's trying to straighten out the monitors that he messed up, and they're locked in that 
[01:26:30]  position now.  Oh.  Hold on, guys.  They look like googly eyes looking back at you.  Why are you shaking your head, Ben?  Take care of this.  You're the executive producer.  That's Ben.  Fix the monitors.  Opie needs them fixed.  Look at it.  It's just rocking through my favorites now.  Oh, is it still floating?  Oh, yeah.  The floating mouse.  Wow.  See?  I didn't do anything.  See what it's doing now?  Yeah, that's hilarious.  Wow.  Absolutely hilarious.  Jesus.  It's like a piece of brain matter in Alzado's head.  Yeah.  Why?  Well, there goes that bit. 
[01:27:00]  That would have killed 10 minutes, but now we can't really do it.  So what happened?  I'm just kind of mad that I said that.  Oh.  I felt bad.  So what...  So...  Sorry.  So the spam mail is getting...  Yeah.  Spam email is getting...  And it could hit our cell phones.  In our area?  Can you imagine...  I'm just trying to upset everybody and alarm everybody like the news does.  Because it's something I read.  Just popping up on your phone.  I'm annoyed now just thinking of that.  And I love when those guys go to jail, those scumbag spammers. 
[01:27:30]  Do they really go to jail?  Oh, dude.  When they really get them, they get huge fines.  Those guys will get years of prison time.  They send out tens of millions a day.  These things.  Tens of millions.  And they all seem to go to my account.  Just click on them, thinking it's from your pal.  You say, oh.  And what are the ones that sneak past your bulk folder?  Like, what gadget is that?  I wonder if they change some wording.  Maybe there's only certain wording.  The bulk folder's king.  I've actually had my email, because it's yellow treats, wind up in people's spam folders. 
[01:28:00]  And it's like, no, this is not a sex ad.  Yeah, sometimes I get emails from my own email address.  I love that.  For drugs.  Or I love when they try to be familiar, and they go, hey, yellow treats, in the email.  Like, that's your name.  Like, who uses just their name?  Like, is Anthony just an email address?  Hey, yellow treats, you need Viagra, spelled with nines instead of Gs, so you can get it  through the filter.  But I think my friend wrote it when it addresses me as yellow treats, or hey, James Norton. 
[01:28:30]  All my friends call me James Norton.  Creep.  And then I get the one from Nigeria, where I'm going to get all that money.  Yeah.  Did you talk about the mortgage one?  The mortgage one, yeah.  If I need a...  I've been approved for a mortgage.  Yeah.  What?  You've been approved.  I'm not buying anything.  If I'm buying a house, I think I'm going to look into getting a mortgage a little more  than some spam email that comes across my email account. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, this is great.  Yeah, let me blow a few hundred grand, and I'll use this mortgage company, the one that's  right here next to the Viagra ad.  I don't know.  I got that email recently, and as you know, I'm looking for a mortgage.  Oh, yeah.  So I just sent out all my banking information.  Yeah.  That's what I did to the Nigeria thing.  Sent him my banking info so he can then deposit all those millions from his assassinated father's  account into my bank account.  Hilarious.  You're going to be on Easy Street soon.  Oh, it's right around the corner.  Right around the corner. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Well, that's busted today.  That's got to be fixed.  And that's askew.  I don't know what happened there.  You were pulling it out of the console.  Oh.  That's what happened?  You were pulling it out.  You looked like a monster.  That's what happens.  Sometimes it will become askew after you practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu on a computer monitor.  They're not.  It's odd.  They're just poorly built.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry.  They just showed Peyton Manning.  He set the record for most touchdowns in a season.  Congratulations to Peyton Manning today.  Oh, you're congratulating him? 
[01:30:00]  Sure.  Why not?  Everyone else is.  Not everybody.  Everyone except his father, you were saying.  Did you see his father?  Oh.  What?  Guys, he sets the record for a season, a touchdown passes.  And his father goes, they ask him, you know.  The great Archie Manning.  Archie Manning.  Who also played in the NFL.  I guess they ask him if he's proud of his boy and stuff.  And he goes off talking about how, you know, well, you know, you've got to think the fathers 
[01:30:30]  that have boys over there in Iraq.  You know, they're.  Well, it's a noble thing to say, right?  It is, but at least throw your kid a bone.  The son is probably there going, Daddy, I'm here.  He's like the great Santini.  Next year, Peyton Manning's going to try to, like, you know, throw 80 touchdowns to get  his approval.  Nothing is good enough for his old man, Archie.  You're going to squirt.  If he didn't throw the ball through the thing, Archie would drop the honey jars on the ground.  Bouncing the football off the back of his head as he walks up the stairs.  Yeah, it's good to say all that about the troops, obviously, but yeah, throw your son 
[01:31:00]  a little bone there.  What record, sports fan?  He's saying it's not going to be as easy to throw the ball through the tire.  That's his way of apologizing to you.  You see Archie Manning throwing the ball through the tire in the rain.  Blight Danner?  Was she in the new Fockers movie or just the original?  She wasn't in the second one.  I couldn't tell you anything about the Fockers movie.  No, we're talking about great Santini, which, of course, Blight Danner was in that, and 
[01:31:30]  I'm wondering if she was in the stupid sheep going to see that number one movie over the  holiday.  Some people are saying it was really good, and some people are saying it stunk.  I heard it was abysmal, but, you know.  They all ran to it like sheep.  Oh, the commercials look so funny.  No, they don't.  But they did look funny.  They looked awful.  They looked horrible.  You see De Niro there just turning down a fan for a photo for the first time ever?  Beg the Fockers.  I missed that part.  Well, it set a record. 
[01:32:00]  I don't really get it with these records.  I don't get that.  It seems like every movie, yeah.  The box office sets these records every weekend.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, non-holiday that start on a Sunday weekend.  Right, right.  In the month, that doesn't start with a J.  For a Christmas that fell on a weekend during an election year.  Enough with the box office record crap.  Well, they were saying the record would have been even better if a long line of moviegoers  wasn't swept away in Thailand. 
[01:32:30]  This set a record when competing with a natural disaster.  Yeah, what are the papers saying about the tsunami?  Wave of death.  Is the post getting outrageous?  Death wave.  Oh, death wave, okay.  Death wave, a Quinn Martin production.  Well, one of the papers-  Water and murder.  One of the papers has a quote from one of the locals.  It just shows you that we just live on completely different levels in this world.  Yeah.  The quote is, something strange is happening with the sea.  Is that what one of the locals said? 
[01:33:00]  Something strange is happening with the sea.  Like nothing, like no technology to back up what's happening there.  Like they still believe in huge sea monsters or something, you know?  In that part of the world.  A serpent's tail moved quickly and made a wave.  Something strange is happening with the sea.  Release the kraken.  And didn't they know this wave was coming for a while?  How many hours did it take to hit land is, you know, what I'm thinking.  You would think if there was a big earthquake-  In the middle of the ocean. 
[01:33:30]  In the ocean.  That they would have a little time.  Does anyone have the answer to that question today?  They look pretty caught off guard.  If you watch them running away, looking over their shoulders,  that didn't look like a lot of advanced warning.  Because they don't really have-  They really don't have the media down there.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Maybe they did have advanced warning, but you can't tell anybody.  Maybe you should give your people a little warning somehow.  Yeah?  Like what?  Wave coming.  What are they going to do?  Tell the little prepubescent hookers so they could tell-  Yeah, tell a- 
[01:34:00]  Well, you know who might be down there on-  With certain radio people.  That is supposed to be a great place to go on vacation if you're really perverted.  Because I've seen shows where they have-  Sri Lanka?  No, like Thailand.  All right, yeah.  Because Thailand got hit too.  But it's mostly Sri Lanka though?  No, it's Thailand, India.  Yeah?  Some other crap hole.  But there are girls that smoke out of their vagges and shoot darts at balloons out of their vagges.  Well, they got-  In these seedy, dark, stinky clubs. 
[01:34:30]  They got the BJ bar too.  The BJ bar.  The BJ bar is you walk up to the bar and have a beer and there's holes in the bar.  So while you're drinking your beer, you shove your mule through it and there's just girls on the other side.  Wow.  You hope.  You hope.  Oh.  It could be little lambs.  Why do I have to pour milk on it first?  I feel better.  I feel better.  Little lambs.  Rotten savages selling your own children in a prostitution.  Oh.  And then there's the sex shows where the guy and the girl will be in the middle area of the round bar just having sex. 
[01:35:00]  And it's like a stripper here.  You know, they come out and then they get done.  Everyone applause, gives them some money or whatever the hell they use for currency there.  Some of the girls, don't they shoot darts out of their vagges?  Yeah, that's what I was saying.  They take little pins with feathers on them and they put the straw in their vag, put the pin with the feather on it in the straw,  and then they can use their vag muscles and shoot the pin out and it pops a balloon.  Well, dude, we saw ourselves what girls could do with their vagges. 
[01:35:30]  Remember the egg tossing chick?  Egg tossing chick.  She was able to toss an egg.  I don't even know what the record was.  Eight feet, 12 feet, something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not using her hands and just her vag.  That bugs me.  Anytime the vagina is used to smoke or spit something out or twist a cherry thing, beat it with that crap.  I want the vagina doing nothing but smelling probably a little more than is pleasant for most people and drip and tinkle.  Nothing weird with the vagina.  Bugs me.  Imagine what it's like, one that's been smoked out of a few years. 
[01:36:00]  Do you want old lady breath when you're going down on someone?  That's awful.  We did that in the studio.  We had a girl that did that.  That's right.  We had a girl that did it on the floor.  We had a girl that smoked out of her.  Oh, yeah.  She smoked a cigarette out of her vag.  That's right.  Imagine if your producer was a woman and her vagina is just opening up.  You know, Steve, I'm sure, has the old video clips.  You should put egg tossing and the girl smoking the cigarette up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  Yeah, we need to see that. 
[01:36:30]  Definitely.  I'd love to see that again.  Let's say hi to Marty.  Marty, what's up?  Marty!  Hey!  Hello.  Yeah.  What's going on, buddy?  Hey, how are you doing?  Pretty good.  Good.  Hey, come on.  How are you?  I'm good, Marty.  How are you?  Thanks for calling the program.  Hey, it was two hours.  They could have had an advance warning.  Oh, really?  Two hours?  That was...  Yeah, it took...  What's that?  It was a nine.  I'm sorry, buddy, to interrupt you there.  They were showing on the news. 
[01:37:00]  It was a nine magnitude, that earthquake.  Yeah, you would think it could have been a nine.  Yeah, it was 100 miles offshore, and it took an equivalent of two hours to hit the shore.  Two hours it took.  And they had no warning to tell people to get the hell off the beaches?  No, they...  I'll just watch that, because I heard surf and turf, and I like to eat, so...  I kind of got engulfed in it yesterday watching it.  Yes, the 4th of July.  Those beaches will stay old.  Exactly.  I don't want to see that kid, my boy, with an older man's penis sticking in him, spilling  out all over the dock. 
[01:37:30]  I want them hung up by their Buster Browns.  Buzz in Texas.  What's up, Buzz?  Nothing much.  What's going on?  You tell us.  Y'all ever been down to boys' down in Mexico?  Have you seen the donkey show?  No.  The donkey show.  I've heard about the donkey show.  I never saw it.  Is it real that these girls do donkeys?  Yes, it is.  The weirdest thing I ever saw.  You saw it?  Yep.  And they bring the donkey out. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, explain what happens.  I was already three sheets of the wind with the Cuervo.  But they bring the donkey out, she lubricates him up and sticks it in.  Wow.  Doggy style?  Yep.  How big is the donkey?  I ain't measuring him.  You were watching.  I mean, how big is the damn thing?  Probably a couple of feet.  Big bell at the end of it.  Yuck.  Discolored pink head.  Blang.  Those are awful. 
[01:38:30]  Animal mules should just be pinched and smashed.  They're horrible looking.  How come animals have ugly mules?  You ever see a horse dick?  It's just like an awful pink head on it.  It's just gross.  Not that human dicks are lovely, but at least they're primarily one color, for Christ's sake.  Oh my God, that's funny.  I don't have freckles on it.  I don't have a blotch on the head.  I'll try to drive this.  Yeah, exactly.  A little filthy horse sheath.  It's a good radio-friendly segment we're doing here. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, right.  Good luck.  I'll try to find something redeeming in this.  Horse cock.  I'm going to edit a horse cock segment.  All right.  Why don't we step aside?  It's time to break out the cereal bowls.  It's time to eat some food, all right?  Oh, cereal bowls are coming up.  I would find a little cereal.  What kind of cereal do you have today, Opie?  I have granola.  Granola?  You have that concrete stuff?  No, no, no.  Just the regular granola.  Jimmy's got a big dried sausage.  Why was this in front of my little, as we say, workspace?  Put in your sausage? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You may have to cook for 20 guys.  With some wine?  Come on.  Knock it off.  I've got better things for you to be doing.  Call Bernie Getz.  All right.  Yeah, we'll play this, and we'll continue, I guess.  Yes.  It's coming to the Gay Channel.  What is it?  It's the second annual male group orgy competition.  And he hits the hole right after Jesse opens it up.  With your host John Madden and Pat Summerall. 
[01:40:00]  And then everyone's kind of slopping around down there and grunting and groaning.  And, you know, you get mud and stuff flying and gang tackles and scrums and quagmires.  No fems, fats, or hairies.  Just the hunkiest gay studs in wild group action competition.  I'd like to pack that guy around, too.  Don't get carried away, John.  There was all kinds of stuff flying around there.  It's male group sex to die for, as described by the best play-by-play team in the biz.  And that was a late one. 
[01:40:30]  That one didn't come and didn't come and didn't come and finally they threw it out of there.  Whoop!  I don't know where that one came from.  Look at that big old beaten lob.  Whoa, what a meal those guys are having.  That look good.  That's a good group.  If you go nuts for tight butts...  You push, you push, you push...  Get Gaperview today!  He just rode him backwards.  Just put him right on his back.  With Pat Summerall and John Madden.  That looked like it was the last shot out of the Roman candle.  The second annual male group orgy competition on Gaperview. 
[01:41:00]  I'd like to pack that guy around, too.  Floyd?  Yeah?  He's gonna fire into his guy right here.  Call 1-800-HEY-CUTIE to order today.  I've read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grave. 
[01:41:30]  And though the news was rather sad, well, I just had to marry that.  He blew his mind down in a car.  He didn't notice that the lights had changed.  A crowd of people stood and stared. 
[01:42:00]  They'd seen his face before.  Nobody would see the choice.  He was one of our hearts.  He was one of our hearts.  Oh, oh, oh, oh 
[01:42:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh 
[01:43:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  I've got a feeling today, oh boy

Television  People Magazine has a bunch of top 10 lists  10 lists  Although, in the movie category  We can only find nine  Even though it says top 10 picks of the year 
[01:51:00]  I'm sure the 10th one's there somewhere  Yeah, you find it  What happened?  Did Spanglish make it?  Spanglish got good reviews though  I don't care  It got good reviews  What is Adam Sandler doing?  I saw the comedy attractions for that  The title of that is atrocious  I know  Spanglish in English  Spanglish  Spanglish  I don't know  I figured I'd just take the role  And try to, you know  Maybe expand my depth  So I'm not just yelling all the time 
[01:51:30]  And making fun of things  It's kind of a chick flick, right?  It looks like a chick flick  Get back to whacking golf balls with a hockey stick  And making us laugh  And punching Bob Barker in the face  You know what's crazy about the top 10 movies of the year?  Even though we can only find nine  I don't know where the 10th one is  And with my OCD, I'm freaking out  I need to know where the 10th one is  If Bernie gets in here, he'll find it  Yeah, he'll fan all nine of them out  Find that 10th one  Find it and shoot it  You find  Here, here, I'll hand it over to you

Nine  Help me  It's driving me nuts  Can we accept that there's just not a 10th movie?  It doesn't really matter, right? 
[01:52:30]  I'm...  No, because now this is annoying me  Right  Hold it  Top 10 picks  Top 10 movies of the year according to People Magazine  One  Two  Three  Four  Five, six, seven, eight, nine  Nine  And then  Does it...  Where's the 10th one at?  Is that...  Where the hell is...  I don't know  Maybe it's SpongeBob SquarePants  I don't think so  It's not in the same format as the rest of it 
[01:53:00]  How many of these movies did you see this year though?  None  And we're supposed to be on top of pop culture  I saw one of them  Did you see Vera Drake?  What?  One of the top movies of 2004 according to People Magazine?  No  Do you even know what Vera Drake was about?  No  Anyone?  I wouldn't even see that  Based on the name  It's a kind-hearted English housewife  Keeps her sidelined  Performing illegal abortions  A secret  From her loving family  In a delicate drama set in 1950 
[01:53:30]  Oh, oh  I kind of remember hearing about that  Who's in it?  I don't...  I remember the amazing thing about this  They said was that she did the abortions with plastic coat hangers  It's Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis, Anthony  Never heard of them  Staunton's accomplished sympathetic performance in the title role  Is as good as acting gets  One of the top movies of 2004  No one saw it  Never heard of it, sir  Did you see Hotel Rwanda?  No  Critical acclaim 
[01:54:00]  Critical acclaim  Box office flop  It flopped at the box office?  Yeah  It came and went?  Came and went  It's still in there  What's it about?  What is that one about, Anthony?  I don't know, who is it?  Don Cheadle?  Okay  Yeah, Don Cheadle, right?  Don Cheadle  And he...  Don Cheadle in Boogie Nights  Yes  I'm an actor  I'm a hotel clerk  When he's in the bank trying to get the loan for his business  The stereo place  That movie's a scream  Yeah, I gotta watch that again  Love it 
[01:54:30]  That was a great...  So why didn't anyone see this?  And what is it about?  You got the touch  No man, you gotta give us the tape  So we can go to the producer at the record company  What was the other song?  You got the touch  And what was the other atrocious?  They were awful  There was two of them  I can't remember the other one  Write that down  We need the audio  We need the audio  You're a winner  Oh  It was horrible  Oh, that was so bad  And then it was...  Ah, it's gonna bug me until I get the other one 
[01:55:00]  Ben, all points to the audio  Alright, so Hotel Rwanda  Recent history comes to terrifying life in a harrowing movie  Based on a true story about how the Rwandan manager of a four star hotel in Kigali  managed to shelter and save hundreds of his fellow citizens during the 1994 genocide in that African country  Like Schinders Blacklist  Oh, okay  Alright, so you didn't see that one either?  No  One of the top movies of 2004  Top movie  And we're supposed to be, you know, on top of pop culture, Anthony  One of the top nine  We're known for that, you know 
[01:55:30]  Yes  Skewing pop culture  Of course  Did you see Hero?  No, that's that kung fu movie  Oh, you knew that one?  Yeah  Scene after sumptuous scene is more wow-provoking than the last in this mini-epic set in ancient China  Makes people want to show their boobies on Wednesday  A complicated tale of love, portrayal, and political intrigue among political assassins  It's a kung fu movie  It's a karate movie 
[01:56:00]  It's kind of like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon  Right  Sort of?  Okay  Sort of exactly like it  Did you see that movie?  No  Alright  Did you see Kinsey?  Kinsey  K-I-N-S-E-Y  Kinsey  The movie about the sex guy  The sex expert guy  I didn't see it  Okay  Who's in that?  Liam Neeson  Yeah  They weren't up in arms  Weren't they Catholic groups upset about that movie?  Of course  Jackasses  So it's about the dude that did the survey, the Kinsey Report or whatever?  Yes 
[01:56:30]  Okay  You didn't see that either?  The sex  No, I didn't  Oh, someone was saying the other song is Feel My Heat  Can he sing it maybe?  Sing us a little of it?  Yeah, let's go to Eric in Texas  Hey Eric, what's up?  I know what the other song is in Boogie Night  Alright, go ahead  What?  Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel  Feel My Heat  Yep  Oh, and they're sitting down writing it on the couch  Feel My Heat, 1997  Little picture called Boogie Nights  Are we rolling on that one?  Yeah, we're rolling 
[01:57:00]  We're gonna get those songs for the program  Alright  Who wrote that?  Ed Norton  It's the funniest callback in the history of television  Ed Norton  Matt in Jersey  Hey, what's up guys?  Hi Matt  The Touch is originally from the Transformers movie  Remember the Transformers?  It's like Optimus Prime  It was done by Vince DeCola  It's like in the climax of the movie  When the Autobots are taking on the Decepticon  It's totally in there  And that's where I recognize it from  When you're doing the song  It's so funny to hear it 
[01:57:30]  When you hear the original version  Of the Transformers movie  Hilarious  It's by Stan Bush The Touch  Oh yeah, I thought it was Vince DeCola  That's right, Stan Bush  That's right  Alright  That's all we got  Sponsored out  Thanks Guy  You ruined it  That's great  And he's so into it  Those awful red like  1978 kind of parachute pants  Awful  Hugging that giant freakish mule  Huge hog  That was a great movie  Except for the last scene 
[01:58:00]  Where that's the big reveal  Is his dick  Yeah  It was like what are you doing  That movie, they should've showed it  Somewhere in one of the earlier scenes  When he was getting ready to the first film  He should've popped it out  Yeah, yeah  And that would've been it  It was too good of a film  And too interesting a film  To make that the climax  Like wow, it really is big  The big dick shot at the end  Terrible  Terrible reveal at the end  Yeah  That was my only complaint with that movie  Alright, Mike in Jersey  What's up?  Yeah, for guys who don't work for  Three quarters of this year  You don't see any movies  I know  We really are idiots 
[01:58:30]  Well, you saw some of these movies  In the top ten list?  No, I was working  There he goes  These movies are too smart for us  Who wants to see Hotel Rwanda?  Right  Yeah, I'm not gonna see that  Did you see another top movie of 2004?  Did you see The Motorcycle Diaries, Anthony?  What? No  Do you know what it's about?  Not at all  In a captivating film about being young  And discovering the world beyond oneself  Future revolutionary Che Guevara  Takes a scenic trip through Latin America  In the early 50's  Ugh  That awakens his 
[01:59:00]  That's horrible  Political consciousness  That just sounds awful  I wanna see Che Guevara doing violence  I don't wanna see him on a motorcycle trip  Alright, well that was one of the top movies of 2004  Yeah  According to People Magazine  Terrible  Did you see Sideways?  Sideways? No, I did not see Sideways  Do you know what Sideways is about?  I've...  All I know is the name  I couldn't tell you what it's about  Raise a glass high to salute this wonderful  Bittersweet comedy about two guys  Oh, yeah  Whose wine tasting vacation 
[01:59:30]  Teaches both valuable lessons about who they really are  The guy's in it from Howard's movie  Yes  The WMVC  Oh, Paul Giamatti  He's hysterical  Yeah, he's excellent  He's a great actor  I know it happens  That's the one where they're having the wine  There's like a fire  And the fire department shows up  And they...  Right, yeah  The one man is...  Oh, come on  The one man is wearing a night shirt  Right  Smokey log  It was a Java log, I think  Well, that's another  I remember reading in the reviews 
[02:00:00]  That's another top film of 2004 that no one saw  How about...  Well, this one a lot of people saw  I didn't see it yet though  Ray  About Ray Charles  I want to see that  Yeah, they're saying Fox there is going to win some kind of...  One of those awards there  It annoys me  Yeah  He's such a...  Because he was just a bad comic for so long  For so many years he's just this bad comic  And then he...  Out of nowhere  They're praising him for the serious role  And, you know, Oscar  And... 
[02:00:30]  I hate when that happens  It would be like our own Jimmy Norton  All of a sudden getting these accolades and praise as a serious actor  I'm not a bad comic  But who cares  I know, Jimmy  That's why the joke is funny  And the part...  Playing the part of frog neck  Is Jim Norton  I think I'm going to be nominated next year for meat tits  All right, cool  And then...  And then... 
[02:01:00]  Rounding out the list  In People Magazine  Top films of 2004  Anthony  The Incredibles  Which I haven't seen yet  Oh my god, it's great  I need the Steve C. pirated, burnt movie  It's a...  You know how Steve does that  Burns all those movies that are still in the theater  And hands them out  And he sells them too  That's right  Good idea  He sells them on the street  Yeah, right around Penn Station  Steve and his flame wear  I can never seem to find those sites  That download them  But Steve, he knows them all  Oh yeah  He gets on that computer 
[02:01:30]  Before you know it  Oh, every movie company's movies are coming down the pipe  I haven't seen a movie in a movie theater in years  Thanks to Steve  No  And if you want to get the sites  What's his email address?  Steve at foundrymusic.com  Yes, Steve at foundrymusic.com  And in the subject heading  The code word is  Hey, faggot  Nice shirt, faggot  Steve, thanks for my copy of The Incredibles  I don't know what you're talking about  I've enjoyed it many, many times  In the privacy of my home  I have no idea  I have no idea  It's Incredibles 
[02:02:00]  How quickly you get movies  Usually when you get these bootleg movies  It's some idiot that snuck a camcorder into the theater  That's so old school  Surprisingly, yours is just amazing  It's crystal clear  I have no idea what you're talking about  Back in the old days  Steve would have had to been in the movie theater  With a small camcorder  Videotaping the movie  Now, with the new technology  Steve knows where to find these digitally online  Download them, burn them to disk  And before you know it  You're in the comfort of your own home  Watching The Incredibles 
[02:02:30]  And, you know, there's just a pesky little thing  That comes across the screen  Every 15 minutes  That says, please do not duplicate  Or something like that  If you're watching this  And if you're not authorized  Call this number  And rat out Steve  But that only goes by for  If you've got a copy  I'd love to see it  But that only goes by  Every once in a while  For maybe two seconds  Right  It's not that distracting at all  Considering you're watching The Incredibles  At your house  Isn't that funny  He wears flaming clothes  And he burns things to disk all the time  I've heard this goes on  I mean, I see them being sold on the street 
[02:03:00]  On 42nd street  Right, right  You know, if you've got them  I'd love to  Bowling for Columbine  Steve gave me bowling for Columbine  When that was out on two disks  Oh, Steve  I've heard that  That hit the street early  Wow  I don't know anything  About what you're talking about  And the village  Thank you, Steve  That was wonderful  Steve sending out flaming bootlegs  I'll be running  And finally  Oh, Ocean's 12  You have that one already?  Dude, how'd you like that?  I've heard  Still in theaters  That that thing is making the rounds  I certainly wouldn't know where you'd get this 
[02:03:30]  Steve's actually got Ocean's 13 out already  It's amazing how quickly  And he doesn't pay his taxes  Right  And he gets free cable  I've heard stuff like this happen  Here's the Sid Rosenberg of our show  There you have it  So, and then finally Anthony  In People Magazine  A movie of 2004  Oh, very exciting  A movie we all saw  Spider-Man 2  Ah  Not as good as the first one  So, out of the top ten  Even though we could only find nine  I saw two of them  And we're supposed to be up on all this  We're supposed to be 
[02:04:00]  Now, Newsweek's top ten is a lot different, Anthony  Maybe we've seen a few of these  Wait, wait  We're doing two top ten movies?  No, no  We'll just go real fast  Newsweek top ten movies of the year  In tenth place is Kinsey again  Ninth place is that Harry Potter movie  The latest one  Harry Potter  Yeah  Eight is the remake of The Manchurian Candidate  With Denzel Washington  Can I ask a question?  Why would that be in the top ten?  What, top ten rip-offs of the year?  The Manchurian Candidate was already done 
[02:04:30]  And it was done great  Yes  You know, some of these movies just don't need to be remade  Like that stupid  Flight of the Phoenix  Well, The In-Laws  The In-Laws  One of the greatest commies ever made  And they remake that with Michael Douglas  Are they insane?  The only time you should remake a film  Is if you're going to redo special effects  Or something that you're going to go  Wow, this is amazing  Why would you remake The Manchurian Candidate?  And it's always they take a black guy  And put it in a white  Like the Honeymooners are redoing  With two black guys  That bugs me  And then if you say it bugs you  People will say that you're racist 
[02:05:00]  Yeah  The hell out of me  That the casting  These classic characters  Classic Jackie Gleason, Art Carney  Did it  It was done  You cannot recreate that  And then they put two black guys in  And the second  Any type of cultural thing happens  Where they try to get a white guy  To portray a person  Or an idea  That was supposed to be black  Black people come out of the woodwork  And just complain  And bitch that  That was a black person  Yeah 
[02:05:30]  Being portrayed by a white guy  You know, this is classic white characters  Why are they trying?  Yeah, the black honeymooners  Just come up  Just come up with a new concept  Right  I know, two black people  In the same building getting married  What's the matter with you?  Ding, ding  Okay, in Newsweek's Top 10  And we're just going to run through it fast  Yeah  Seventh place, Friday Night Lights  Anyone know what that movie was about?  Wow  With Billy Bob  Billy Bob Thornton  I don't have no idea  Oh, that was that football one  Oh, okay  You know who else was in that? 
[02:06:00]  The little kid from Sling Blade  Remember the kid?  Oh, yeah, yeah  Yeah, he actually reunited them for that movie  Alright, and then the sixth place movie  No one has really seen yet  Because it just came out  But it made Newsweek's Top 10  The Aviator  Ah  And then you got fifth place  Bad Education  Never heard of it  No  Fourth place, Million Dollar Baby  Clint Eastwood's movie  Third place, Osama  What?  About a girl caught under Taliban rule  Oh  Yeah, and her name is Osama  It has nothing to do with Bin Laden 
[02:06:30]  Isn't that weird?  You would name a movie that?  Yeah  And then second place is Before Sunset  Which was a remake of  What?  It was a chick flick  Wait, I have to look up in my little workbook here  Oh, yeah, the original was Before Sunrise  Whatever  And then the first place is that movie Sideways again  Ugh  These aren't really  Wait, that's the number one movie according to Newsweek  That movie about, yeah, the wine tasting 
[02:07:00]  The wine tasting trip  Here comes the fire department  Shut up  I was sharing  Of course  It was a slow day in the show  I figured I'd help out the program  Jonas, what's up?  Hey, what's going on guys?  Hey  Long time listener since back in the Boston days  Nice  Just wanted to say  I think next they should remake Roots with a white guy starring  Yeah, there would be a big problem there  Punching out 
[02:07:30]  Alright, thank you  So there you have it  Memory making films is just a testament to the lack of good creative writing  That's why everything's a rip-off in Hollywood  Because they're all just a bunch of like 20-something year old  Little round bespectacled faggots  With, you know, with the I'm a writer unshaven look man  Man  And they're not funny and they're not talented  And that's why you got this crap  No, it happens, they're too cool to actually work is what happens after a while  They're too busy, you know, calling hookers to, you know, blow them in their offices and stuff 
[02:08:00]  Like having a writer's meeting  Yeah, they do have some good qualities  Yeah, absolutely, that kind of just cancelled out the point  That does make them cool  So, there you have it  I saw none of those  I saw one  I don't get to the movies a lot  These days  I thought I'd go to the movies in my neighborhood, Opie  You know, I live in a Jewish community now  Instead of in Brooklyn  Where there were animals in the movie theater  Literally, there were zebras 
[02:08:30]  And rhinoceri  Rhinoceri  Walking around in the aisles  In the movie theaters I went to in Brooklyn  Actual animals  And I once got hit in the back of the head with a big Samsonite suitcase  That a gorilla was throwing around the movie theater  As I tried to watch Mission Impossible 2  The last time I think I went to the movie  But this time I figured I'd go to the Jewish movie theater I go to  Mm-hmm  And it seems that the Jewish people in the area  Are a little stingy with the money to keep the upkeep on this movie theater 
[02:09:00]  Really?  I walked in, it was a shithole  A crap hole  I walk in there, it smelled of urine  Yeah, that's what I was thinking  Wow  It's like, okay  Theater 6, down the hall on your left  Maybe they just heard that Hitler was still alive  Jesus  What do you...  Why Hitler?  Yeah, what is... 
[02:09:30]  He's not alive  It's a Jewish neighborhood  And they were scared and maybe, like, relieved themselves  Oh, oh, oh, like, they heard that Hitler might have been alive  So they peed themselves  Jesus  Why?  Why would they all hear it in the movie theater?  Maybe, like, it...  Maybe it just started as a...  Like, maybe one person found out and then, like, oh, God, help me  I think Hitler is still alive  Is there an announcement they make in the middle of the movies?  Like, in the... 
[02:10:00]  Hitler is alive  Why? I just wet myself  You know, like, maybe...  I don't know, one person heard and then they were just, like, whispering to each other  And it got around the theater really fast  No? Anyone?  I don't know, I...  Anybody? Help me?  No?  Oh, I broke this too, I guess  Oh, no...  No?  Did one person get it out there?  Maybe  Wow 
[02:10:30]  No?  All right  I'm essential to the movie theater effort!  There's a one-armed man scooping popcorn into a bucket and trying to put butter on it and the guards shoot him because he's not qualified to...  Well, why the hell else would it smell like urine?  I don't know  Getting back to your story  See, because it was kind of a...  But I did notice it was like...  This was actually in Port Washington  It wasn't in my neighborhood, it was just a little north of my neighborhood, Port Washington, which is supposed to be a really good area still  The movie theater was right next to some apartment buildings that Hispanic people were pouring out of like cockroaches 
[02:11:00]  So you're saying the Spanish people are peeing in your movie theater?  I think maybe the Spanish people are peeing in my movie theater  And then I walk up because the guy goes, you know, theater six on your left  And it's one of these movie theaters that I guess a long time ago was the, you know, where you went to see the picture show  Because the outside still looks like a classic town movie theater, but then they divvy it up to make it a multiplex  Opie, ten seats 
[02:11:30]  This theater had ten seats  You're such a liar  I swear  A screen at the front of this was no bigger  You weren't in the movie theater, you were at Martini Steve's house  That's what I think it was, ten seats  Oh, maybe they wanted it to be just like an oven in World War II  All right, I get it  The screen was the size of the Opie and Anthony thing behind you  Shut up 
[02:12:00]  I'm not buying this  Few feet wide, few feet high  Was it called the Anne Frank movie theater?  Anyone? No?  Just for the record, that's worked  Just for the record, I'm pushing the cricket sounds for myself, okay  Oh  It was the smallest  Yes, yes  It was the smallest  It's this greed thing that happens  Where they want a multiplex  Instead of building one  They divvy up these old movie theaters  Instead of having a nice big theater to sit in with one movie playing 
[02:12:30]  They play five movies  And what movie did you go to see?  What the hell movie was that that I went to see?  Jesus Christ  You sure you weren't in Steve's basement?  No, no  Oh, it was  Jacob the Liar?  No, it was  I went to see Blade  Trinity  All right  That was the one  That didn't make the top ten list  And I never even saw it on the big screen  Saw it on the  The small screen at the movie theater  What's the matter?  It's a beautiful life?  Sold out?  Hey, I was trying 
[02:13:00]  I get an A for effort  Kills a cricket  They will hit us downstairs  I thought it was kind of clever  It's one of those thinking men jokes  No?  Thinking men  Thinking men  All right  Anthony, I was just browsing through People Magazine  Yes  The fine magazine that gave us the top ten movies of 2004 
[02:13:30]  And they have a section on fads of the year  Fags of the year  Fads  F-A-D-S  Fags of the year  Oh, I thought you said fags too  I was going to be like wow  Anyone from Sirius is in that list  Dude, why?  Why obsession?  I was just curious  Oh  It's only $50,000  Fags of the year  It cost you $50,000  Yeah, it's only  Why are you holding a grudge?  Yeah, as Opie says, it's only 50 large 
[02:14:00]  It's only 50 large  Give me a bag of shells  I had it  And I went with it  He did you a favor  Easy come  Easy go  You would have just spent that money on prostitutes  Yeah, and the mortgage I'm having trouble getting  Sure  Anthony  Fags of the year  He'll be at CES in Vegas, Ben  What does that mean?  You can maybe talk to him there  Oh, okay  The Cock and Joyer Society?  Yes, I was on Eaters 
[02:14:30]  And I didn't have the S yet  But the same first word  How do I get the E out of there to make this cock and suckers?  Sorry, Syracuse  That's going to be a tough one  Beep and beep  Let's go to Flea Man from CringeHumor.net  What's up, Flea Man?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Good morning  Good morning  I just want to say that if Anthony is in the movie theater  and it's like as hot as an oven  then Steve might have been there  Oh, wow  We'll go back to the Hitler jokes  No, no one's going to remember the Hitler joke now 
[02:15:00]  Thank you, Flea Man, you saved me  Thank you, thank you  Alright, Anthony, so Fads of the Year  2004  Things that might have caught on during the year?  Sure  Celebrity Poker, of course  Ah, very big  Texas Hold'em is taking off  Everybody's playing  Everyone is playing Texas Hold'em now  No one plays regular poker anymore  like Seven Card Stud or anything  It's got to be Hold'em  No Limit  That's right  Celebrity, I was watching those  I watch them all  I'm like addicted to it  I was sucked into the fad 
[02:15:30]  Oh, we got milk?  Yeah, but we have no spoons  So if we want to eat, we can just kind of  What do you mean we have no spoons today?  I don't have a spoon  Go ahead, Anthony  Celebrity Poker, Texas Hold'em  Nothing, just, you know  I'm a victim of it myself  Alright, also  A big fad this year, Anthony  Pet rocks  No?  What year is this?  Close to Kabbalah strings  Oh, Kabbalah strings  It's just like little red yarn  that you place on your wrist  You can tie up Hitler with it  if he's still alive 
[02:16:00]  Poisoned chocolates and a shot in the head  and he's still alive  He's still alive  That's bad news for me  and bad news for Israel  Jesus  That's not an anti-Semitic  That's a nice little  Sollozzo turn, Ben  And don't say Jesus, Ben  It's a good one, too  He was a prophet  That's it  Go back to snoring  Snoring?  Yawning, snoring, same thing  Kabbalah strings, Anthony  Said to ward off the evil eye  The red bracelets were worn by Demi Moore 
[02:16:30]  along with Madonna  Madonna  Madonna, the big wearer  Britney Spears  and of course Paris Hilton  but she had no idea  why she was wearing it  Retard  Why is this phony whore  running over to Esther?  Esther, she changes her name to?  Is your work that devoid of meaning  that you now have to search for it  Why don't you speak through your work?  That's pretty much  I think you hit it right on the head there  Her work is now devoid of any substance 
[02:17:00]  The most unsexiest name ever  Esther  That's why  Esther  Probably to show that she's got this real  Is there a worse female name than Esther?  Nope  Mildred  I stand corrected  There are names that  you gotta think  there were some hot women  way back when  in the 20s and 30s  like hot women  that just had the worst names ever  You'll never see that come back  You'll never see like 
[02:17:30]  Hey man, I'm going out with Gertie tonight  Really?  Yeah, you know that Gertie?  She's the hot chick  Oh yeah, she's a three-holer  Gertie's a three-holer  Hubba hubba  a three-holer  23 skidoo, I'm going out with Gertie  She comes up the back door though  Millie  Yeah, that Millie  She knows how to  hob that knob  Dude, I can't get Ethel to swallow  Ethel  Ethel  That is another awful name 
[02:18:00]  Ethel  You should just not have  It should never have been used  Yeah, in the past 50 years  Anthony, another fad that  swept us in the past year  Another shit dick  As we say goodbye to 2004  Going brunette was a big fad this year  It was  Brown became the new blonde, everyone  Oh, the new thing  Renee Zellweger, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Ashley Simpson all hit the hair dye bottle  You're such a Zellweger  Zellweger lover 
[02:18:30]  That was another fad  Going brunette, I don't know anybody that did  The low carb craze was a big fad this year  Very annoying  I saw at Jimmy's show  There was a big bag of pork rinds  On the table in the dressing room  And it was claiming how it was zero carbs  Zero carbs  So if you're trying to lose some weight, dig into those pork rinds  Bread and pasta  Naughty words in the year 2004  No bread on the table, please  And another thing that was a huge fad 
[02:19:00]  Was these pocket bikes, Anthony  They're pint sized motorcycles  You see this?  The homies love killing themselves on these things  No, they're even smaller  Yeah, I know, I've seen that  They're like a foot to two feet off the ground, that's it  I didn't know pocket sized lesbians were a fad  Yeah  Yeah  Tweed was in, Anthony, this year  I knew that  Tweed  Wow 
[02:19:30]  Whatever  What?  Not even gonna try that one?  No, it was brooches  Brooches were in, Anthony  Also, the  Livestrong bracelets, everyone has the yellow  I broke mine, I had one for a while  You broke it?  Yeah, by accident  Uh oh  I got mad and I didn't even know you could break these things  You got mad at something and ripped it off your arm?  Yeah, yeah, wow  I hear a lot of the counterfeit ones were coming out too 
[02:20:00]  But what made one authentic and one counterfeit?  Like did money that you spent on it go to the cause?  I'm hoping  It's the Lance Armstrong charity  Yeah  The yellow ones, Livestrong  Everyone's wearing those things  But then they started selling them  I saw some in like bodegas around here  Different colors, different causes  Oh really?  Yeah, they're ridiculous  Why are they raceless? They should be cock rings  That wasn't that bad  I thought that was a pretty clever tie-in for Lance Armstrong 
[02:20:30]  It actually was a good one  I'm just trying to get myself out of the barrel  And well, surprisingly they don't have the ribbons that everyone's  Slapping on their friggin vehicles  Support the troops, support this, support that  I'm talking about different colors and different types of ribbons  Get those off your car  When everyone has something, it's just  It's corny  It looks so stupid  I've seen people with five of them on their car  What are they, magnets?  Just kind of stick there?  I guess 
[02:21:00]  Support the troops  I want to support the troops  Jump on, you know  The next plane going over there  And do a show for them  Yeah, either do that  Or pick up a rifle and start walking the streets  Oof!  Or barrel into a cabbie as he's getting back into his vehicle  So he doesn't funnel  I don't get how  Throwing a ribbon on your car is actually supporting anything  It's telling everybody that you are supporting the troops  What does that actually do for the troops?  But how are you supporting the troops?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah 
[02:21:30]  The only thing I can figure is if you're giving money  Right  You get the ribbon and then that money is going toward the troops  Or their families or something  Then I get it  But you know it's not  Then I get it  But what does that mean to just throw something on your car that says  I support the troops?  Unless you support them  Maybe you go to a website and you join  But mostly  Organizations that send food over there for them  Most of these rubes, they're usually in minivans  They're not doing anything  No, they're not doing anything  Throwing the ribbon on their car because it seems like the thing to do  The patriotic thing to do 
[02:22:00]  But how are you supporting the troops?  Yeah, really  I could drive around in that huge SUV sucking up all the gas  You know what I mean?  Hey, I don't have one on mine  Alright, but I don't  Explain to me how you support the troops by throwing one of those on your vehicle  You don't by just doing it  It's like putting a sign up that says  Hey, I supported the troops  But what did you do?  Right  Just putting the sign up doesn't mean anything  Little Jimmy Norton supported the troops  Of course he did  Last Christmas he was  This time last year you were in Iraq  Performing for the troops 
[02:22:30]  Toting a rifle and shooting some ragheads  That's supporting the troops  But I don't get if you have a ribbon on your car  How you're actually supporting them  You're not  But it's all  It doesn't matter  It's more symbolism than substance in this country  If you have a little tag on your car that says you support the troops  It's more important than actually supporting the troops  And not boasting about it  Or putting a sign on your car that you're doing it  I'm just thinking there's other ways you can support the troops  Besides just throwing a ribbon on your car saying you're doing it 
[02:23:00]  How about sending them money for body armor?  Armor for their Humvees  Food that they normally wouldn't be able to get  Things like that  Homemade cookies  People like that  Speaking of troops  The new Iraqi  The biggest Sunni party in Iraq  Is pulled out of the January election  You know  I really wish there was a way to gracefully bow out of Iraq  And just put Saddam Hussein back  And you know what?  Continue gassing them  Yeah  They deserved everything Saddam gave them  If they towed the line 
[02:23:30]  And  Listened to Saddam  They would live their life  Go to their crappy little  Work jobs that they did  Or whatever they did to survive over there  If you crossed Saddam  And you were one of these scumbags  Like the people that are shooting at our guys  You'd be dead  Oh by the way  Even if they were law abiding  If they had a wife  Hey  Or a daughter  That Udayak Hussein wanted to have sex with  Then you were going to be murdered and thrown to lions  Right  They deserve it  They're an awful awful country full of 
[02:24:00]  Awful  Spineless  Enslaved people  That don't know what freedom is enough to want to fight and die for it  So they  We get our guys killed for what?  It really bugs the crap out of me  If I thought that in time these animals could appreciate it  It would be one thing  But they don't  They never will  Nope  They'll keep sending  Suicide bombers into mess tents 
[02:24:30]  And videotaping it  That's lovely to see  And this election thing that's coming up  Oh man  They love crowing about this  Like oh we're going to have democracy  And no we're not  There's going to be 9,000 polling places that are just going to be targets  For these animals  The only people I don't want to see murdered are the Kurds  They broke away in the early 90s  And they don't want anything to do with being a part of this  They want their freedom  They have the internet  They just want to live the way they're living  Which is free 
[02:25:00]  They're more Turkish than they are Iraqi anyway  Yeah  They kind of moseyed on in  And kind of claimed that area of Iraq as theirs  But it's really not  And Saddam  He gave them hell  Sure did  And they should  I like your idea  Just pop him back in there  Leave and go okay  Business as usual  Sorry to inconvenience you Saddam  Gas them  Just gas them  Do you really think that Al Zarqawi would be operating in Iraq  Do you think he would have went there from Afghanistan if Saddam Hussein was still in charge 
[02:25:30]  Do you really think that would be allowed to go on?  He'd end up in one of those chambers  Chained to a wall  Getting his testicles taken out with pliers  They'd go house to house with machine guns  And until somebody coughed up information  Everybody would just be gunned down  That's how he would deal with them  There are people in this country that don't understand  Some people need to be led like that  They need a leader that is a tyrannical monster in charge  To lead them because they don't have any clue of freedom 
[02:26:00]  They don't want it  They can't appreciate it  And they certainly won't fight and die for it  No, no, no, they're not willing to  They're just awful, awful people  Any of the people in the army and police force now over there  The Iraqi army and police force that we've tried to put together  They're there purely for the money  They get extra money just for doing these jobs  They're not there out of pride of freedom for their country  They're making extra money  Because they might get blown up or shot at any moment 
[02:26:30]  Keep letting your wives and your daughters be raped by the regime  Real brave  Where was your insurgency and your anger  When you were being under a boot heel like that  But they understand that the US military won't strike quite that hard  Won't do what needs to be done  Because of pressure from the left back here  They know exactly  No, the second somebody gets shot over there  You need a big investigation as to  Maybe criminal charges should be brought against the soldiers that do it  Which just annoys the hell out of me  At least in Afghanistan 
[02:27:00]  It looks like things are coming around  I mean, it's like the Taliban was an oppressive, awful regime  People were much happier to be free of them than the Iraqis are  They weren't as organized as Saddam either  They didn't really have a  They were pure terror on everybody  Yeah  But yeah, they kind of cleaned them out  And now Afghanistan seems to be turning around  But Iraq, forget about it  That place is a mess  Just sickening the way the country  It's like, just the way they're seeing the Americans as the Crusaders  All right, with that fucking religious babble 
[02:27:30]  You 15th century cocks  I hate them  I hate them  I just hate the way they're reacting  Yeah  Like we're imperialists  Why would we want to live there?  It's a crap hole  Ugh  All right, we got an explanation for the ribbons, by the way  Oh  Let's go to Gary in Texas  Gary, go ahead  What's up, boy? Hey, hey, no nuts  Hi, how are you?  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa with the insults  I know the explanation for a lot of them ribbons that you see for supporting the troops 
[02:28:00]  Yeah  A lot of the wives, they get together and they have like a support group for each other  And a lot of them will sell those to help pay their bills while their husband's away  Oh, okay  All right, so you're buying the ribbons and the money's going somewhere, right?  Well, a lot of them are  Are you sure? Yeah, there's a lot of counterfeit ones  I'm sure 90% of the ones you see here in New York are fake  And no one's getting any money except the towel head that sold it  Like that scumbag that was selling the ground zero silver and the coins  That awful company saying it was going to victims' memorials and everybody knew it wasn't 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, well, they got him  Yeah, someone is saying, here's a trucker, trucker, go  Yeah, listen, most of these ribbons that I've seen for sale are in towel head stores  You know, 7-Elevens and stuff like that, they're selling the ribbons  Now, where is that money going to?  Yeah, I'm sure it's not going to the cause  You know, listen, I really enjoy your show  I've been listening to it since you guys started on XM  Oh, thank you, appreciate it  Well, if you buy them in those stores, it's going to the wives of soldiers 
[02:29:00]  But they consider a soldier a guy that runs onto a bus in Tel Aviv with a bomb strapped to him  Animals  Chad and VA, what's up, Chad?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy Norton, thanks for going over there and supporting our troops  Just recently  I'm sorry, buddy, go ahead, I'm sorry  I just recently got out of the Army and a really good way to support the guys over there is to go to the USO website  They've got links up on how you can send soldiers phone cards, care packages, all that kind of stuff 
[02:29:30]  You guys have a good one and thanks for what you're doing  What is it, USO.org?  Yeah, USO.org  Okay, thank you, Chad  Well, Colin wanted to go back this year  And I didn't think I could because of our schedule  But then I was like, you know what, I'd really like to do that  But the USO said, no, it's just too dangerous, they won't let him go back  It's crazy over there now, yeah  It's crazy, it's insane  It's insane, it's gotten worse  And they're making no bones about how much worse it's going to get  Even Rumsfeld, when he went over there, told everybody, you know, hey, it's going to get worse 
[02:30:00]  It's going to get worse  There really is, and I've got to say that this administration was completely unprepared  And the fact that Bush called, when he landed on the carrier, just to shut his critics up  He called an end to the war, just to shut his critics up, that was really a bad move  Yeah, there was no end to the war at that point  Such a bad move that he was re-elected  Well, yeah, but again, that shows you how awful the Democrats are  How bad the Democrats and Kerry are  If the Democrats had a decent candidate, Bush would have been kicked out on his stupid ass in a minute 
[02:30:30]  Well, alright, and finally, the final fad of the year, Anthony  Oh, we're still on the fads  I went off on a little tangent, that's okay  Was purse puppies  Mostly these celebrities walking around with their tiny little dogs in their purses  It was a huge fad this past year  The only thing that should be put into a puppy is a little midget in a bride's outfit  And when you open the purse, she comes out and goes  And then you close the purse and take the purse by the strap and swing it against a wall 
[02:31:00]  Until you hear a dud ice cream sounding thud  Wow  Your purse will end up smelling like a movie theater  Yeah  Tell the dog, Hitler's still alive and a wet all in your purse  I thought it was clever  I thought it was clever  Then your mother says, you really don't want dogs to go doo-doo in your purse, do you?  No, nice sweater  Alright, we gotta eat some cereal, so why don't we take a quick break 
[02:31:30]  Cereal!  We're gonna play another Stephen Lynch song  And maybe we could get a long sweeper or something  Because I gotta get some food in  Alright  This isn't working this way today  There's a lot of little bugs in the studio today, by the way  Bugs?  Yeah, nothing works here  Here's Stephen Lynch  Watch them run  Watch them fall  Watch them try to catch a ball  Olympics 
[02:32:00]  Special Olympics  Oh boy!  Watch them laugh  Watch them drool  Watch them fall into the pool  That's diving!  At the Special Olympics  You're trying to take pity!  And I know  Full well 
[02:32:30]  That I will burn in hell  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball  Gotta be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life  At the Special Olympics  Special Olympics!

This Wednesday, December 29th, from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., get to the parking lot of the Home Depot at 6130 East Colonial Drive in Orlando, Florida, and pick up your Wow Sticker.  Whoa!  Those aren't real.  Yes, they are.  John will be handing out Wow Stickers from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., one-third of a mile east of 436. 
[02:38:00]  I'm getting an erection as we speak.  Once again, here is how it should sound.  The Wow Sticker Stop, brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  On the Opie and Anthony Show, we're going to make fun of people with Down Syndrome.  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle, hoping candy comes out and blow the door off the plane.  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So be it.  Fred no more.  Just a kill of pieces. 
[02:38:30]  To prepare for war.  So be it.  Saddle the score.  Touch me again for the words and you will hear evermore.  Get out of here, bro!  Son of my room, stop it.  Hey!  Give me a fucking 42 in the United States!  And you can kill him!  What are you saying?  Come on! 
[02:39:00]  The sounds of war!  The sounds of war. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  This is the one virus spreading across America.  I don't like war, Opie.  I like peace, man.  Why don't you shut your liberal mouth?  Somebody was writing in on instant feedback saying that.  Shut your liberal, your awful liberal mouth.  What?  You hear half of what people say.  They listen to half.  Because unless you say, I am 100% behind everything that happens. 
[02:40:00]  If you veer off of that, then you're a scumbag.  We hate liberals.  We hate liberals.  Who can mistake this talk for liberal talk?  Why are you saying Saddam should be put back in power and gas his people?  Yeah, I'm sick of our soldiers getting killed for savages.  And I want to see Saddam murdering them.  You don't hear many liberals saying that.  Not many.  No, no.  God almighty.  There's nothing worse.  And I'm like you.  I hate the left.  But there's nothing worse than the term liberal being misused like that. 
[02:40:30]  Like doing people when the whole St. Pat's thing happened that went,  A bunch of liberals.  No.  What?  Wrong group.  That was the wrong group.  Yeah.  Who was up in arms about that.  I don't know many liberals that were backing what we did either.  I would love that jizz bag to call in.  Just call in and say why you called us liberal.  You know, come on.  Yeah.  All right.  Screw that.  We got presents.  Ooh.  Yeah.  We got presents today.  We don't even get it.  Isn't it kind of an insult? 
[02:41:00]  Why, Anthony?  I don't know.  It's more sex videos on sex gels and sex CDs.  Oh, oh, oh.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Pat from Buffalo.  Hey, Ant, I was poking around on TiVo and found that Dwarves, not a fairy tale,  would air on Wednesday, January 5th at 1138 a.m. on HBO.  Is our crew writing that down for a sound clip?  This is a must-see, people. 
[02:41:30]  The Dwarf Show, that way you can get the joke completely when you see that little midget  getting proposed to by her little midget husband, and she's surprised by the ring,  tries to cover her mouth up with her hands, yet her hands being so small, her arms being  so small, can't reach her mouth.  So they just flutter by the sides of her face as she goes, ooh.  Oh, tears run down her longer than normal head. 
[02:42:00]  It's just enraging.  And you should have a fat guy who claims to be Irish but looks Lebanese sitting next to  you and crying.  That's what makes the perfect picture.  Dude, doesn't this make it?  No, sissy, it doesn't.  That fucking-  Sissy.  That Bob really irritates me with his rotten tears.  Ugh.  What a softie.  I don't mind someone- I cry sometimes, a sad song will come on, I'll drop a tear during  a set.  I watch Cuckoo's Nest, I cry almost every time I watch it, I drop a tear watching Cuckoo's 
[02:42:30]  Nest.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But, which shows you what a scumbag I am, that real life doesn't make me cry, and yet  a Nicholson performance.  And I'm not just saying that because Ben is wearing the same outfit that Nicholson had  when they went on their fishing excursion.  When he went on the boat, yeah.  Oh my god!  Why is Ben dressed like Mr. Scanlon?  The famous Dr. Scanlon.  Sorry, Ben.  Ben looks like he's going after Jaws.  Yeah!  He's got his Jacques Cousteau cap on.  Let's drink to your dumps.  Let's drink to your dumps. 
[02:43:00]  I don't want to open that spark, boy, and have all those 50 pounds of shit spill out all  over the dock.  Oh.  All right, well, we got some presents, Anthony, overnight.  Yeah.  A bunch of sex videos.  But not like porno, like we usually get and enjoy here on the program.  No.  Is this someone trying to get on the program, or what?  Ben, why would Ben know?  Why would Ben know?  He's too busy eating and yawning.  I don't even know where these came from.  They're like sex help tapes.

Is there anything worse than that when you're trying to avoid eye contact 
[02:45:00]  because you're thinking of anyone but this codependent slob?  Oh, my God.  But they keep touching you to look at them like they want meaning out of this.  It's like, look, pig.  What you are is you're a hand.  Right now, you're a hand.  Do you understand?  You're a large hand without the thumb, kind of like that midget.  Oh.  Oh.  Don't distract me by looking for real human contact.  Oh, man.  I'm using you just to spill bleachy seeds.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  They're horrible.  The Incredible Orgasm video.

Yeah, pour some syrup on my bag, and then your diabetic fiancee licks it and goes into a  coma, so you jump on her and pump one more into her before the paramedics arrive, lop  off three of her toes.  Stinks.  Stop with food.  Would you like me to put whipped cream?  That stupid stripper trick. 
[02:46:30]  It's not sexy.  Oh.  How about a little egg salad in the asshole?  You scoop it out with a wooden ladle.  Really hot.  What about the edible panties?  They're awful.  You ever try the edible panties?  They look ridiculous.  On your chick?  They're good on wheat bread.  There's no reason for edible panties.  They look like fruit roll-ups, and they just look completely ridiculous.  They don't look like panties.  They look like boxers.  Like they're big square things of fruit roll-up that have two leg holes in them. 
[02:47:00]  That's what you want to smell.  Her taint sweat on a nice cherry topping.  How awful.  Get a hair in there.  It's stuck to it, and you have to scrape your fingernail into the candied underwear to  get that stupid nail off that hair.  Food during sex is never hot.  There's this myth that it's sexy.  Oh, and I'd like to drip some chocolate syrup on your breasts.  No. 
[02:47:30]  Stop.  Do you know what's sexy?  When a girl's going down on me, and I hold her head, and she goes,  and I go, and spit on her back.  And believe me, I'm not yanking that one out of thin air.  That's hot.  And you wonder why you don't have a girlfriend.  You really want to have a girlfriend, don't you?  I don't know.  I'm in the middle, because I want those scenes, too.  I want the love.  I miss the hand-holding, but I also like the spitting on someone's back.  So that's 10 secrets to great sex, Anthony.  Wow.  Yeah.  With the food and all that.  The edible panties.  Oh, man.  Food.  A little syrup on the vag. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  I like the smell of a natural.  I like the natural.  It's sexy.  Honestly, I don't mind a little sweat.  I mean, I'm not even joking.  I like that little tinkle in there.  It turns me on.  Get the food out.  I don't need to sweeten it up.  It annoys me.  Well, this one's going to drive you guys nuts.  Ooh.  Volume 3, Making Sex Fun with Games and Toys.  Ugh.  Games.  Dude, if you need games and toys to make your love life better, it's time to-  Shake your balls like dice.  All right.  It's a six.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  It's time to trade in your chick.  Hopefully I'll land on the vagina.  One, two, three.  You shouldn't have to work this hard.  No.  You either have the chemistry or you're not.  Here's a little game called, see who can throw themselves down the steps fastest after  I come on them.  Come in them would have been the joke, though.  No, because come on them is more degrading.  Yeah.  Coming in them implies love and hopefully family starting.  No, but then-  Coming on them is like, here's what you are.  You're a glove. 
[02:49:00]  You're a jack-off sleeve.  But let's go inside the joke here.  If you're coming in them, because it goes with one of your jokes.  Then they might have gotten pregnant and that's why they would throw themselves down the stairs  Oh, okay.  But I wasn't thinking in those terms.  You're right.  Here's the difference.  In a pure panic that you might have impregnated someone, they're going to throw themselves  down the stairs.  I will venture into the joke with you.  Here's the difference.  All right.  The original joke that I do about any woman I get pregnant is going to throw herself down  the steps.  It's basically a knock on me.  That's the beauty of being him.  He doesn't have to worry about girls actually having babies because they don't want to have his 
[02:49:30]  child.  So they throw themselves down the stairs.  That's a knock on me.  But this was a knock on her.  Right.  Because I'm saying who can throw themselves.  Meaning that after I dump on you.  So degraded.  Just toss yourself down the steps.  You're so degraded that you have to throw yourself down the stairs.  Yeah.  Or like that's what I would want you to do after I come on you.  Right.  Just to remove yourself from my apartment and throw yourself down the steps.  Throw yourself down my stairs.  To stop bugging me so I can watch television.  By the way, we're venturing back into commercial radio.  Yes. 
[02:50:00]  And we're being heard in Syracuse.  Yeah.  And everyone's panicking like our show's going to change and stuff.  No.  Yeah.  This whole segment, Syracuse can't even run.  Unarable.  So relax.  This is Van Halen.  Yeah.  This is what we do.  We continue our show.  We do it.  And then if they can make sense of it and throw it on commercial radio, they will.  So Anthony, making sex fun with games and toys.  Games.  Here's the most enjoyable, comfortable way you and your partner can learn in the privacy of  your own home.  Maintaining a better sex life takes a lot of creativity and variety. 
[02:50:30]  Making sex fun takes the viewer beyond the skills and usual techniques of the established  repertoire to introduce new activities which can spark your imagination and help invigorate  your relationship.  Learn how incorporating adult toys can give a lift to love.  I want...  Steve's got to throw this one in.  Dildos and stuff.  Can we throw it in over there?  Oh, of course.  That's a DVD player?  Please.  Oh, how cool.  I didn't know there was a DVD player on there.  Hold on.  I don't think we do.  No?  That's not a DVD player.  No?  Oh, where's the cable box? 
[02:51:00]  Where's Steve?  Someone get Martini Steve.  Ope needs him.  We want to see what the adult games are all about on this tape.  Can we do it in here or is it going to be a hassle?  Here, Ben.  Just try to figure that out.  It's Martini Steve.  There it goes.  Thank you, Ben.  All right.  As we try to figure that one out.  What is that one?  Better sexual techniques, Anthony.  Oh, techniques.  Now they're delving into cunnilingus and fellatio.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that it?  How to be a better lover. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  You too can be a better lover, giving more pleasure to your partner.  That's self-explanatory.  People put these together are filthy.  Anthony, the...  Just the animals.  The joy of erotic massage.  Erotic massage.  One of the most sensual massages.  If your chick had an ass like that, you would have no problems with your sex life, okay?  Look at this ass.  What are they dripping on it, though?  Oil?  Oil.  Oil or Earl?  Yeah, some oil.  Let me ask you, honestly.  If you were massaging that girl's ass, that's a nice one. 
[02:52:00]  Would you lean down and just take a little sniff?  Yeah.  Would you have the cheeks, right?  You have to.  Of course.  How could you sniff if you're digging in mouth first?  Yeah, you're right.  It's good.  It is kind of hard.  You'd have to check out the funky treasure.  Be coming up every two seconds like you're swimming in the Olympics and your mouth's got  to go...  You know how they turn their heads sideways?  Get that big gulp of air and you go back in. 
[02:52:30]  So you learn how to massage each other, Anthony.  Right.  There you go.  Sensual massage.  With the girl with the perfect ass on the cover.  Just like your chicken home.  Heart-shaped ass.  Just like her.  And then, whoa, hey, advanced sexual techniques.  Was there a beginner and advanced?  Yes.  So I guess you wouldn't want to go right for the advanced.  No, you'd have to slow down.  See specific...  You'd be making all kinds of embarrassing mistakes.  Okay.  See specific positions and techniques for deeper penetration.  This is...  You know what this is?  Let me tell you what these are. 
[02:53:00]  Wait.  It's excuses to have porno around your house for the guys that have these nagging rags that  won't allow them to see real pornography.  This way, he goes, this is for us, honey.  For us.  Right.  This is us.  And he can play it and watch couples have sex.  Dude, it's advanced techniques.  It's kind of funny.  For oral loving.  Anal stimulation.  Manual genital stimulation for men and women.  Plus demonstrations of male and female orgasm.  Will you use that for jacking off?  So there you go.  That's... 
[02:53:30]  I don't know.  They gave us like six videos.  Yeah.  You know, that advanced is the ass.  You don't want to go for the ass.  Yeah.  It's...  In the beginner.  By the way, this ass on this cover is almost as nice as Warren from 10 to Midnight.  That guy had the best cheeks of anybody in movie history when he was running down the  street naked just murdering women.  Me and Florentine used to talk about that.  The people would be like, you ever see the guy's cheeks?  And people are like, what?  I haven't seen that movie in years.  I'll be back!  Oh, no, you won't.  No, you won't.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:54:00]  We get it.  It's snowing outside.  I mean, let's calm down with the freaking snow coverage here in New York.  How's it going over there, Martini Steve?  He's hooking up something we can watch DVDs with in here.  A PlayStation.  Oh.  Very smart.  Anthony?  Oh, erotic.  What do you have now?  These things are awful.  We got the massage oil, the warming oil.  Oh, with the warming.  Oh, this stuff that gets warm on you.  I don't like that.  And then you blow on it and it gets cool and...  Put Ben Gay on your nuts.  Your satchel.  And the lubricant. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, the lube.  What kind of lube?  Is it...  That's...  It's just regular lube.  Can I see it?  I'll tell you.  I'll smell it.  I'll tell you if it's like the Astroglide.  Because the best stuff is Eros.  Astroglide is awful.  It smells like rubber cement.  The Dice gave us all that Astroglide stuff.  Yeah.  So...  And then they give us...  Let's talk to him.  No, this goes over.  Years ago.  Oh, no.  I haven't talked to him in a while.  Back when he was famous.  Back in the old days.  Let's see.  Here's some lube.  You don't want to use the KY.  He was always talking about how bad KY was. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  No, it gets sticky after a while.  You use this lube.  And music came with these desks.  So you throw this on as you're...  As you're banging?  As you're banging.  This lube is awful.  Awful.  What's wrong with it, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I think that Ben's egg salad would have been a sexier and more useful lubricant. 
[02:55:30]  After it was run through Ben.  Which would be in about eight minutes.  Old goose colon.  This is good.  Remembering Lacey.  Her smile would make you smile.  Smell it.  Smell it.  It doesn't smell good.  It smells like that cheap astroglyte garbage.  That's crap.  Not even very slippery.  No, dude.  That's good for one pump.  And then you've got to pull out and put more on. 
[02:56:00]  Because it starts to get stuck in her dumper.  After two pumps, you're pulling out spare ribs.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, that's crap.  So this is music to F-by.  Music to F-by.  This is awful.  This is what's called trying a little too hard.  Yeah, to be sexy.  Like, there's plenty of music out there that's good F-music.  You don't have to buy a disc of F-music.  I could have sex to taps at the funeral.  Oh, Steve's got it hooked up. 
[02:56:30]  Play the video, Steve.  Open it.  I would like to see it.  You go to chapter selection.  Oh, yeah.  We don't need the big introduction.  I guarantee it's some stupid sex surrogate doctor.  Sex bird in a stupid business suit.  We've put this together to help you and your partner.  Hey, partner.  And it's not hardcore.  I guarantee it's that Cinemax nonsense.  Oh, you don't know how to work these through PlayStation, do you?  Yeah, I do. 
[02:57:00]  Well, it looks like somebody's job is online.  See?  Look, you're right.  Where's the volume?  Look at these two.  We'll be fucking later.  But right now, we're clothed to tell you about this.  And I guarantee it's not hardcore sex.  It's that soft core drivel, which gets nobody off.  What happened?  What, they make it a game?  Yeah.  I have to, like, hit the right thing?  Why are you shooting the black person now?  Oh, there we go.  Oh, okay.  It's going to turn into Grand Theft Auto. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, listen to the sexy music.  Sinclair Intimacy Institute.  We're here at the Institute.  Ah, now what do we want?  Chapter selection?  Yeah.  All right.  Let me get down.  No, go down.  No, you got to use the cargo.  Wait, wait.  I'm trying to get to...  And?  It won't stay.  Why won't it stay on chapter selection?  Oh, I did.  I did a quick hit.  Did you see that?  All right.  Uh-oh.  Now it's scrolling. 
[02:58:00]  What the hell?  Let's see if there's any real sex in it.  I guarantee it's soft core.  All right.  What do you want?  Because we have to go by real quick.  Yeah, go with the love swing.  If this is soft core, I'm breaking one.  All right.  Let me see if I can hit it in time.  No, I got summary.  Jesus, the worst one I could have possibly hit.  Well, can't you hit one hit and then go back, like, just while it's playing forward through  the chapter?  I'm trying, Steve.  I didn't touch anything.  What are you doing?  What are you doing with the other controller?  I just picked it up to make sure it wasn't triggered anymore.  What do you have, Stroker 1 and Stroker 2?  Okay. 
[02:58:30]  Jesus Christ.  Someone broke one of the controllers.  Who broke it, Steve?  I don't know.  All right.  So figure out which one's broken and unplugged it.  Probably one of the goddamned interns.  That one's definitely broken.  Well, let's hope it wasn't that one.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  All right.  Let's go to the phones as we try to figure that out.  No?  You're the piss out of me.  Yeah.  You don't want any idea.  Josh in Nebraska.  What's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hi, Josh.  Hi, you snookums.  Thanks for calling the program. 
[02:59:00]  I'm going to do a little something funny with every state that calls in.  How's the corn out there?  Nebraska corn.  And that wasn't because of the joke bomb.  That's actually the sounds of Nebraska on New Year's Eve.  Go ahead, Josh.  Well, I was basically just calling in.  I'm just trying to just call in and just basically just congratulate Jim on now upgrading to now being the lubricant diva.  Yeah, but you know what?  I really am an expert on lubricant, dude, because I spent a lot of time scrapping alone. 
[02:59:30]  And this lubricant, I knew what it would be when Ope pulled it out.  I knew it was going to smell like that chemical.  All right.  Let's slow down with Ope pulling it out, okay?  All right.  Yeah, well, I pulled out the lube out of the little box.  Oh, right.  You're right.  All right.  Well, Ope was kind of smacking my face with it going, who's happy for their job?  Who's happy for their job?  I knew it was going to...  I had a 50-gallon drum of it at the house with a big pump on the top of it, just ka-chunk, ka-chunk.  Well, dude, I don't know what you just said because the phone cut out.  I'm sorry, bro.  I'm sure it was a good joke, but I missed it. 
[03:00:00]  What did you say?  What's that?  What did you say?  The phone cut out.  I was saying you probably have a 50-gallon old drum of lube with a nice little electrical pump at the top.  So...  Later, fellas.  See you later.  All right.  Bye, Gia.  You guided him into that wreck.  Oh, dude, I couldn't wait.  Why doesn't anything ever work?  I don't get it.  We just thought I had...  Steve, what's going on over there?  Steve?  We have a busted controller that keeps scrolling through all of the different choices, so I 
[03:00:30]  can't stop on my dick.  How did it break?  Oh, I don't know.  I think Anthony spiking it into the floor might have had something to do with it.  Well, what about the other one?  Yeah, try the other one.  I don't think the other one ever worked because this one's totally not responding at all.  All right, try the other one, though.  That is the other one.  No, try the one he broke.  I'll try one more time.  I'll just press everything.  See, like that.  Oh, oh, no.  Now it's mute.  Oh, good.  I wish it would work because I got it started. 
[03:01:00]  Again.  It's muted, Ant.  How do we unmute it, if I may?  Unmute the TV.  Unmute the TV, Martini Steve.  Oh, okay.  Now we're going to have to just let it play.  No.  Because...  No, we can't do that.  Because you still have to hit play video.  Play video.  I can hit chapter selection.  There you go.  I bet.  Quick, quickly.  No.  There's nothing going on.  And we're just wasting time, though.  All right.  L2 and R2.  It's broken R2.  Huh? 
[03:01:30]  No, this...  I think screwed.  It's broken now.  Oh, well.  I'll try the other one.  Ow!  That was my...  That was your what, Ben?  That was what?  What?  That's my...  Those controllers stink.  All right, hold on.  That was your PlayStation?  That's my PlayStation.  It's broken.  You've got nothing working, Steve.  Yeah, you don't have anything working.  It's the same screen we'll be looking at in four hours.  No, Steve.  Oh, oh, oh.  Steve's got it.  Go to...  Sex and Pool.  Tie-up games?  Tie-up games.  Okay, there you go.  It's like a home invasion.  There's a bunch of Dominicans in the video. 
[03:02:00]  All right, here we go.  Tie-up games.  Tie-up games.  All right.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Many couples enjoy the notion of consensually surrendering control through playful tie-up games.  Sexy.  The intention is never to hurt or to abuse the partner.  Rather, it is a form of trusting and agreed-to erotic play, which has its own script and results in mutual pleasure.  Yeah, that's what you want to do.  Listen to this guy as you're talking about.  Rape is violence.  The fantasy of being forced to have an erotic experience is something else. 
[03:02:30]  Many women who talk about these fantasies are not talking about rape, but an erotic confrontation.  This is morally permitted because they are being overpowered and are absolved from  any responsibility.  Another element of this fantasy is that they surrender to the experience.  Being swept away.  What a wrinkled mouth like an asshole moving.  She does have, like, a blue mouth.  Some of the sex games played among trusting, comfortable couples involves tying up your partner or being tied up yourself. 
[03:03:00]  Who is this Tony Dowell-looking guy?  The helplessness of being tied up can give you the freedom to totally submit to stimulation provided by your partner.  Him and his Ray Liotta hair really make me sick.  Make sure you don't do anything that you normally wouldn't do.  You could lose the trust of your partner if you go too far.  All right.  Before any knots are tied, pick a word that could be used by the person who is tied up to end the game.  Stop.  A safe word.  Make sure it's not a word that you would normally use so that it doesn't get used by accident.  Like sticking up my ass.  A safe word like stop or no because that would deprive you of begging for freedom when you actually didn't mean it. 
[03:03:30]  It's fun to beg for mercy when it's just a game and you don't want to be taken seriously.  Of course.  The key word should be used when you actually want to stop.  Colon cancer.  You're both having a good time.  Otherwise, someone could get hurt or embarrassed.  Tie-up games or bondage only work when couples feel better afterwards than they did before.  Here we go.  It's over, Jenny.  Wait, here we go.  Oh, ominous.  Ew.  Ew.  The guy's tied up, Fred Eagle on the bed, and his soft junk is gently laying to the left. 
[03:04:00]  And what was this film?  When was this film?  1979?  Look at that mop in her lap.  More important than the kind of restraints you use is the idea of letting yourself be helpless.  Punch him in the balls.  Although you might be able to break the restraints if you try.  Don't try.  For many people, being tied up is the only time that they totally lay back and receive it.  And she's just tickling him.  That stinks.  What is she doing?  She's rubbing his arm. 
[03:04:30]  Use his mouth as a toilet.  God almighty, what's wrong with these people?  Uh-oh.  Oh, she's rubbing her flappy tit on his jaw.  This is awful.  This is horrible.  Is she going to pop it into her mouth at least?  Ew.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Whiskey!  Ow!  What did she do to his yam bag?  It's not a doorknob, you whore.  Why is she twisting Wade Boggs' strotum?  That guy does look like Wade Boggs.  With his awful mustache.  Oh, it's clipping. 
[03:05:00]  She grabbed his yam bag and twisted it like a doorknob.  Yeah.  What a bitch.  Is this hardcore or no?  The guy's obviously not hardcore.  Guy.  She's just flopping it out of the way.  Oh, this might be real sex.  What is she doing?  She's yanking on his yam bag.  Wait, wait, wait.  I don't like that at all.  She's squeezing.  Oh, this might be hardcore.  Let's see.  She's squeezing his yam bag.  And now her face is right in his lap, but you can't see what she's doing because her hair's in the way. 
[03:05:30]  I know.  Move your hair!  Ew, I think she's going for a taint lick.  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  She's going for the funky treasure.  It's like a muskrat's running up his ass and she's licking it.  Oh, Christ.  Once your lover is tied up, do the same things you do without the bindings.  Wait, Bob.  Look at this.  That is awful.  Come on.  Let's see it.  Stop with the soft core.  It looks like that guy's toupees in her lap.  What's going on there? 
[03:06:00]  Oh, God.  This is awful.  She's sucking it now.  Is she?  Yeah, but it's far away.  It gives you the across the room look.  With kind of the top of her head is in the way of the real action.  I don't think you're going to see a money shot on this one.  No.  He's not even hard.  He's packing one and a half.  She's twisting it like the end of a balloon.  Oh, Jimmy, she's pinching the nipple.  I don't like my nipples pinch.  I like them gently tickled.  A little tweak of the nips.  And then back to the...  Oh, God. 
[03:06:30]  She's trying to tune in Tokyo.  She's got an Austin Powers chest going there, too.  Oh.  Oh, a little close up.  What is that?  She's holding his junk and rubbing it on her lips.  You're going to hurry to bring your partner to Oregon.  Oh, look.  The guy...  The guy's not even...  Why does it keep stopping?  It's like watching Ben talk.  It's just jerking around and stopping.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Your partner's tied up in the... 
[03:07:00]  Ew, ew.  She's going to...  You never can watch.  Put that muff on his face.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  Ew!  She's rubbing her gash and putting it in his mouth with her fingers.  There's nothing sexy about that.  This is the worst thing I've ever seen.  This is not sexy.  There's nothing hot about this.  Oh, look at her.  She's humping her fingers like a dog.  I liked her body when it was in the shining in a bathtub.  It stinks.  This is the worst.  Look at her bun.  She's just awful. 
[03:07:30]  All right, well, that's it.  His sweaty...  He has a forehead and hair like Ben, though.  Wait till you see how sweaty he is.  He's just laying in bed.  He still has nothing going on, man.  No, he's packing a half.  There's nothing going on.  Why do you think he's got nothing going on?  She's working like crazy and just nothing is happening.  What does she shave her vagina with?  Miracle-grows?  Jesus.  Oh, now she's...  Jacking him?  She's grabbing the base with one hand and jacking with the other.  To make it look hard.  She's squeezing it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's an old porno trick.  Yeah.  Look at his Ben hair.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  They're going in for the 69. 
[03:08:00]  69.  Boys and girls.  Oh, this poor guy.  Oh, well.  Jesus.  In that position right now, she should be dropping something that looks like a railroad  tie on his chest.  Oh, this is just awful.  This is a horrible couple.  I just don't want to see this.  And this could have been sexy because it's kind of like real people.  It's not like a porn, which I would have liked.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  He's doing a little...  He's trying to get free.  He's trying to get free.  Oh, she's lifting her leg up like a dog taking a leak on a hydrant. 
[03:08:30]  He's sniffing the balloon notch.  You can always say the key or secret word.  All right.  Wow.  He got loose, everybody.  Oh, she was doing something he didn't like, so he said the key word.  Yeah.  Putting that thing in his face.  That's it?  That's it.  All right.  That's the tie-up one.  That was awful.  Now it's off to romantic sex.  Why don't we have these two banging?  No kidding.  Those ugly, awful people.  That was some horrible pornography.  All right.  We'll go back to the chapter selection if we can. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Good luck.  Steve, you think you could get there?  Martini, Steve, what are you doing?  Don't pause it.  He paused.  Now go to the...  Yeah.  Touch the...  No.  The other...  Yeah.  No.  The...  Steve, you got to go back up to the thing.  Yeah.  Go over there.  There you go.  All right.  What are our choices?  We should look at one more real fast.  We got sex games, sex toys.  You wanted to see toys, right?  Where's the sex swing?  Bungie Love Swing.  The Bungie Love Swing.  All right.  Let's check out the Bungie...  Is that a black guy?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  We could have a big cock alert. 
[03:09:30]  Bungie Love Swing.  Unable to re-disc.  I think it's skipping a little bit.  Yeah.  Now you've done it.  Steve, what are you doing?  You're breaking this good equipment.  Steve.  Oh, it's starting again.  Good.  Now we're going back to the beginning for the 10th time.  This stinks.  That would have been a good bit.  That would have been another great bit today.  Two bits we couldn't do because of equipment failure.  African gentleman in a swing.  Yeah, exactly.  Steve's trying again. 
[03:10:00]  All right.  Here we go.  We're trying again.  Bungie Love Swing.  Bungie Love Swing, Steve.  Click on that.  Did you click on it?  Yeah, I did.  You did?  All right.  You clicked on it?  What are you doing, Steve?  Steve, did you click on it?  Yes.  Steve, you got to click on it.  Oh, why don't you click on it?  No, just click on that over there.  Oh, he's asking.  It doesn't look like you clicked on it.  You're not clicking on it.  You're standing here doing nothing.  You didn't really click on it.  Try a different one.  Try a different one.  Read the...  Why don't you just step on that awful PlayStation?  You got to pop the disc out and rub it.  I'll buy it for me.  I'll buy it for me.  Put some of that lube on the disc.  Oh, is that your personal one? 
[03:10:30]  I promise.  What are you sorry for?  Ben should be apologizing to you for bringing in faulty equipment.  Bringing in crap like that.  Yeah.  You're right.  We're trying to make a radio program here.  So quickly.  All right, well.  What's the matter, Steve?  The disc is dirty.  Forget it.  The disc is dirty.  The disc is dirty?  It just came out of the thing.  It came out of the packaging.  It just came out of the package.  Did Opie smear something on it?  I didn't do anything wrong.  Maybe that lady rubbed her fingers on her snatch and then smeared them all over the CD. 
[03:11:00]  You got the touch.  Oh.  You got the power.  Yeah.  Wow, rock.  Is this the original or from the movie?  This is the original.  Yeah, it's the original.  I like the one from the movie, too.  I like the movie one.  I know.  Yeah, the originals.  That rocks. 
[03:11:30]  That almost hit me.  No, it didn't.  It did.  You got the touch.  Brendan in Atlantic City.  Yo, guys.  The only thing worse than watching bad porn is listening to people watching bad porn.  Ah, exactly.  Well, you know what?  We would have been able to go with it if our equipment's working.  Half the time, we're just trying to get the video to play.  You guys slept late this weekend.  Oh, you don't like Little Jimmy's comments on the pornography?  Sir? 
[03:12:00]  I thought we made something out of it.  Guys from Atlantic City, yeah.  Go gamble!  Oh, you showed him.  Yeah.  Now what, Steve?  I told you something new about everybody's steak.  Did that thing really just come out of a package?  Like a shrink-wrapped package?  They just opened it.  It was perfectly well.  I don't know what's the problem.  Well, thank you, because it's completely scratched up.  Really?  Yeah.  They sent us bad products.  They gave us scratched up, uh, ridiculous porno?  That's impossible.  It just came out of the packaging.  What is it?  Oh, we're back to Sinclair.  The Intimacy Institute. 
[03:12:30]  Ugh.  All right.  Now what are we doing?  We're going through...  We don't know.  This is...  See if it works.  They're chapter selection.  All right, good.  It's working a little quicker now.  All right.  Let's go.  Oh, good.  Bungie Love Swing.  Click on that.  I did.  Bungie Love Swing.  All right.  We just want to see if this guy's a big cock.  I just want to see this...  See the colored gentleman's hog.  Oh, yeah, baby.  This is ridiculous.  Who the hell...  Listen to the music they're playing.  It's like African.  Oh, my God. 
[03:13:00]  A Bungie Swing for lovers almost makes zero gravity...  Look how far he's pulling his ass away from her.  He must be huge.  Let's see it.  This is awful.  Where are you going to hang a bungee swing in your apartment?  I don't know.  How practical.  How do you have sex without laughing?  Her teeth are like a hyena.  This guy hangs on a heavy-duty bungee cord that swings both up and down and side to side.  Yeah.  Oh.  Nobody shaves in this.  Look at that snatch.  It looks like a wallet.  This is old video, man.  This really...  Even though it looks like it's new, but... 
[03:13:30]  Hey, it's a white chick.  Oh, at the bottom of her feet.  Oh, it was in the bungee swing.  Well, he's a little darker than her.  She's cafe latte.  There's no pressure on her back or legs.  Oh, who cares?  This swing makes standing position intercourse much easier.  Makes smoking crack during sex even easier.  This guy's just violating her as she's in this whacked-out swing.  She has hair like Walona Woods. 
[03:14:00]  I don't like her Walona Woods hairdo.  Oh, my God.  It's Kong music.  When does the pepper spray go in his face?  All right.  This is awful.  This is really horrible.  Oh.  They're not showing...  Oh, wow.  They flipped her over.  How the hell did he get in that position in a swing?  She's on her stomach.  She's on her stomach just swinging away as he's entering from behind.  In this awful swing.  You heard...  Doesn't it look like she's getting choked by the swing?  That makes it hotter. 
[03:14:30]  This is ridiculous.  Uh-oh.  Who has an apartment with 30-foot ceilings?  All right, well...  It's great.  If you live in the Sistine Chapel, buy this.  This sucks.  It really does.  Oh, they're going for the back of the ball shop.  Yeah, they don't show anything.  This is terrible.  This is silly.  This is absolutely...  You want to see them violating her.  Yeah.  Sex shouldn't be silly.  I want to see that big thing just causing her complete spinal cord damage.  All right, well, enough of the, uh... 
[03:15:00]  Steve Hope wants this turned off.  The bungee love swing is awful.  Hey, thanks for sending in your, uh...  Let's give them a little plug.  Uh, you know what?  There you go.  There's your plug.  The Sinclair Institute.  Stinks.  That's good stuff.  Just let it play in the background.  Oh, Jesus.  That's great stuff.  Yeah.  Hey, wait, what's this one?  Oh, the erotic massage.  This is going to be hot.  Garbage!  Relax. 
[03:15:30]  You know what the erotic massage is?  It's some expressionless Asian paying off a slavery ship debt while she jerks you off  in some basement in Crown Heights.  God, that was irritating.  Why the violence?  It's just annoying.  What are you doing with that sausage, Ben?  We're going to see that in one of the videos, I'm sure.  Pallic foods.  You know, a dried sausage works great during sex. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, God.  Me and my lover shared dried sausage.  I think it's some dummy at the, what's it called?  The Bag of Leukemia Sexual Institute.  Boy, I'll bet you the Opie and Anthony Shaw would love this.  It's really racy and they like that kind of stuff.  The Sinclair Institute.  Yeah.  Do you know how annoying it is when I'm hitting this and I can't break it?  I can't even break a DVD. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, those little fingers gave out.  Good stuff.  All right, well.  That's that forced sexual enjoyment stuff.  Shouldn't need that.  We'll play a little, uh, a little, uh, technical virgin thing here as we go to break and then  we'll continue.  All right.  Righty-o.  I've got big plans for my future.  A good college, a career, maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on is getting pregnant. 
[03:17:00]  That's why I choose anal sex.  I mean, sure, it hurts a little.  And I wind up walking funny for a day or two.  But I think my future's worth it.  Anal sex.  The smart choice for your future.  Mon âne est de façon insensée fucable.  My ass is insanely fucable.  Amériez-vous pincez ma tarte frémission d'amour?  Would you like to pinch my quivering love pie? 
[03:17:30]  Mmm, mais 152,000 impôts de watt.  My breasts are like 2,000 watt light bulbs.  Amériez-vous jouer l'air dans Tokyo?  Would you like to play Tune in Tokyo?  Oh, seulement Opie and Anthony pouvant satisfaire mon besoin pour la géante, parpitante, la viande des hommes américains.

[03:21:30]  As we watch the sex toys portion of the video.  That chick is awful.  She's got a Dorothy Hamill hairdo.  When was this film?  It looks like someone's mom. 
[03:22:00]  It's awful.  And a Gloria Leonard.  Well, Jonathan writes,  Once a girlfriend used a bunch of whipped cream on me during sex.  Afterwards, we fell asleep.  Next morning, we woke up smelling like sour milk.  Dude, that's purple.  I don't mind a purple one.  Oh, no.  That is a disgusting, disgusting clam.  Yeah, it's not.  It's not, to be honest with you, it's a little too thin and indented.  I prefer a meteor.  It looks like purple steakums.  Where did I get this chick from? 
[03:22:30]  That is exactly what it looks like.  Oh, steakums.  Steakums.  If she squatted over a frying pan in a minute, she'd be ready.  And you'd hear...  All right, well.  Yeah, this is kind of corny.  Really awful.  What is it?  Give me one of those.  When was this stuff filmed?  I mean, there's no way it was filmed anywhere near 2004.  I don't know.  Ah!  What?  1991.  Yeah.  Revision 2002.  Where does it say 1991?  Down here on the copyright or whatever. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, okay.  1991.  But even in 91, I mean, in the late 80s and stuff, I mean...  Girls weren't shaving in the early 90s.  They weren't?  No.  No, that's a new phenomenon.  Awful.  I love it.  How could anybody like it natural like that?  Yuck.  All right, anyway, back to the show.  We've established these videos stink.  She does have an awful do.  Anthony, the oopses of the year.  Ah.  In People Magazine.  Our year-end countdown.  People that did something where they went, oops! 
[03:23:30]  Oops!  I know of one.  Well, yeah.  Scott Peterson.  I was hoping we would do a show without...  What?  No, no.  I'm just...  He probably went, oops.  That awful thing again.  Of course, Ashley Simpson was one of the big oopses of 2004, Anthony.  That was a big oops.  Caught limb syncing on SNL in October.  She blamed acid reflux for causing her vocal cords to swell so she couldn't sing.  The fallout, no permanent damage.  On December 8th, she nabbed Best New Female Artist at the Billboard Music Awards. 
[03:24:00]  Stop.  That was a pity.  How do you give her Best New Artist?  She stinks.  You know what?  She's a fraud.  Yeah.  If a comic went up and just recited his...  Why do comedians not have this leeway?  These fucking musicians have it so easy.  They redo other people's shit.  Comics can't do that, at least not with integrity.  Maybe I can go up next year and do a, you know, nigga with a seizure and get the same accolades  Pryor got in 1975.  Give it a try.  Oh, that's so aggravating.  Ashley Simpson had her own music this year. 
[03:24:30]  No, no.  I know she did, but I'm saying she can lip sync.  Like, I'm saying that the comedians don't have any of this crap that these faggots have.  No respect.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Well, she's now using the butterfly variation.  This is just awful.  It really is.  You know what little sex toy?  She should be using the belt around the neck so she can auto-asphyxiate.  Wow, who's that?  My friend.  Oh, I remember her.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  She hasn't turned around, so I don't know who you're talking about.  She's beautiful.  She's absolutely beautiful.  From...  Yeah.  From...  Okay, sorry.  Tara Reid Anthony made the oops list of 2004.  Oh, her boob came spilling out.  Yeah, she was on the red carpet.  She had a boob job, and she...  Wow, wait.  You bend over and look in that knapsack.  What, are you shitting me?  Come on, take your time and check. 
[03:25:30]  You bend over.  Look in that knapsack.  Bend over, bend over.  I'm giving her...  There she goes.  Very nice.  Ooh.  Oh, my God.  You know her, Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're friends.  What?  We're friends.  You're lying.  She looks like she's late for school, dude.  I know.  What did you offer her?  I don't know.  Two lollipops and a note from the principal.  Nice.  That girl looks like she might be a senior in high school.  You're not friends with this girl. 
[03:26:00]  There's something going on.  No, no, no.  Not at all.  You're...  What is she getting out of this?  Oh, sure she'll find out in either, what, 10 years, depending on incubation.  We're trying to do this show, and this brunette is outside the big picture window, and she's  bending over.  It turns out it's someone to see Jimmy Norton.  She's pretty hot, huh, Ben?  Braces.  She's gone now, Ben.  She's my friend from out of town.  Friend from out of town.  Yeah.  Steve, what do you think of Jimmy's little friend? 
[03:26:30]  That's Jimmy's friend?  Yeah.  Wow.  Nice.  Nice braces, too.  I like that.  This is cute.  Never get them fixed.  Never, never, never.  She's got braces.  Braces.  Yeah.  Is she staying with you, Jimmy?  We're probably going to get her hotel, but I don't think one's available, so that's  probably going to be the choice.  Jesus.  Well, I'm a good guy like that.  If someone needs a place to stay, you know, and they have a vag, they're more than welcome  to a vag.  Oh, I'm sure a big fat pad would want it.  Look how small this guy's dick is on TV.  Is this stimulation for children?  This is awful.  What the hell is that? 
[03:27:00]  Oh, my God.  If you had one that big, why the hell would you appear in a video?  Oh, this is the lesson here is how to not laugh in your lover's face when he pulls that  out.  It's a pinky with a helmet.  Oh, my God.  Look at, look at the little guy.  You want to just kiss his penis and go, mm.  I didn't know Howard made these type of videos.  Ooh.  All right.  That's just awful.  Oh, these videos still stink. 
[03:27:30]  And he looks like the comedian from this old house.  Who's that guy?  God almighty.  I can't remember his name.  Way to do a reference.  All right.  Anyway, so the big oops is Tara Reid is on the red carpet.  She just recently had a boob job, and she tells everyone she didn't know that a boob slipped  out, and the paparazzi went nuts, and, you know, there she is.  Oh, my God.  It's a suction cup on the end of his tool.  That would do nothing for me.  Ew, look at that bunghole on this chick. 
[03:28:00]  She's awful.  Oh, my God.  This is the hairiest mess they just switched to.  She's using a vibrator on herself.  They got a close-up on this clam, and unbelievable.  Look at it.  Look at the butt.  Oh.  Oh, look.  She's laying on her back, and you can still see her bunt.  It looks like an aerial view of the Jersey Pine Barrens.  She's filthy and fetid and deserves to be playing with toys alone in her middle age.  Oh, my God.  Look at her go.  Anyway, so Tara Reid made the oops list, Anthony. 
[03:28:30]  Steve, can I ask a question?  Steve just wrote me a note.  Did you give out my email address on the air?  Why are you asking me that, Marquise?  Because there's 30 emails in my account right now.  What is the subject?  You faggot.  And one of them surprisingly said, sorry, just doing what Jim said to do.  I actually apologize.  I can't believe they would do that.  Anthony, another oops.  Hannah Nicole Smith at the American Music Awards in November. 
[03:29:00]  Smith garbled her words and was helped offstage.  She blamed nearsightedness, claiming she couldn't read the teleprompter.  She knows exactly what she's doing.  Oops.  This is her way of getting attention and getting her name out there and her picture.  All of the tabloids.  The fallout.  These seem like publicity.  Of course.  They're all publicity stunts, except for the Ashley Simpson thing.  Fallout two weeks later at the VH1 Big in 04 award show.  She was again acting odd.  That's what she does now.  That's what she does.  Oh, she's so unpredictable.  Got to tune in to see what she does. 
[03:29:30]  Is that what we've come to?  That's unpredictable as some drunken pseudo-prostitute might mumble and say the F word?  That's our idea of wacky?  That's pretty much where we're at now.  Jesus Christ.  In 1981, Ozzy was eating animals on stage.  Entertainment stinks.  Why does it always have to go back to Ozzy?  I know.  I noticed that, too.  But it's the only one I can think of.  Ooh, that's a nice one.  That's a nice one, Ant.  All right.  Anyway, Anthony, and the final oops.  Do you want to guess what the biggest oops of 2004 was?  Anyone?  It looks like somebody put a bunch of chewed-up hubba-bubba in a cow and blew it up. 
[03:30:00]  I like that one.  That's nice.  I prefer them larger, but...  I'm sorry, Opie.  What was that?  At least she shaved...  Yeah, the lips.  Yeah, and the...  Yeah, the...  Oh, I know.  And the whole taint area.  Okay, what was the biggest oops of 2004?  The biggest oops of 2004. 
[03:30:30]  Let me think.  I don't think I have a clue.  Celebrity makes a...  Was it Paris Hilton's sex tape getting out?  Well, it should be Dan Rather reporting those documents,  but, of course, it won't be.  Of course not.  That's not celebrity enough.  Biggest oops of 2004, Janet Jackson.  Oh, of course.  How silly of me.  I was thinking of Michael raping children,  but no, it's Janet's breast.  My finger's all lubricated. 
[03:31:00]  How could that be an oops when it was planned?  Of course.  Have a little Jesus juice.  Oops, my finger went inside you.  I love the fact he put booze in a Pepsi can  and feed it to the little blonde youngsters.  Jesus juice.  What a despicable thing.  Fingerprints all over the porn mags.  Both of their fingerprints.  That's right.  Keep supporting them, America.  You hold one page...  Whoa, hey!  Hey, now.  What's going on there?  That's...  There's a finger in something.  Fingers in the...  That?  In the dude's balloon nut. 
[03:31:30]  Is that a guy?  Yeah, that does teach...  Oh!  She had her finger in his ass.  The chick with the Dorothy Hamill hair...  Oh, no.  Butt plug in her hand, dude.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Here it goes.  He's arching his back a little bit.  Oh, he's pushing back.  Oh, we're going to get some prison sex here.  All right.  And she's putting her hand up by her face.  It was just a crack.  Oh, jeez.  Here we go.  This is what you can use to...  Yuck.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Well, that's not emasculating. 
[03:32:00]  That's...  Ah!  And there it goes.  Ah!  I mean, just showed his face.  He's going...  Oh!  Oh!  Stupid John C. McGinley face.  Really enjoying that, are you?  Of course.  Because his wife looks like a man to begin with.  Oh, she's atrocious.  She's awful.  You know what this does?  This pretty much takes away any power he has in any future argument over the car, money,  anything.  You know, he's being all macho and yelling at her for something, and she just goes, 
[03:32:30]  Hey, remember when I stuck that dildo in your ass?  He's like...  Why can't they show anything hardcore?  You want to see any more than that?  She's at least given him a handy.  It's like, show something.  This is terrible.  Oh.  She shoved that thing right home, didn't she?  And here's the good-looking people not doing the sex.  No, of course not.  This video blows.  It really is the worst.  Oh.  All right, so there you go.  The oops is over.  I'd like to find out who made this and eviscerate them.  Ugh. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  Oh, finish the line, Ann.  If Big Fat Pat...  Yeah, that's true.  See?  I got interrupted.  Someone on Instant Feedback saying I should continue that.  And I think it's Pat.  Oh, Jimmy was saying that if somebody doesn't have a room to go to, he would, you know,  Hey, you know, they're invited over.  Sure.  Because his attractive friend is over, but... 
[03:33:30]  Hey, that's what you see during breakfast every morning.  Burt Reynolds having sex with some blonde in your kitchen.  Burt Reynolds and Lonnie Anderson.  What happened to the sex video?  What a fool this guy is.  He's got his purple robe open.  And she has her cute little pink robe that she got for Christmas on.  She looks like Tina Yothers.  Oh.  And Burt Reynolds, the guy does look like the 70s smoking the bandit Burt Reynolds.  Oh, they're in this little country kitchen.  Yeah, it looks like a sitcom kitchen set. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, he's giving it to her while her awful stomach is shaking.  Ew, what is with her belly?  I thought this was footage of the tsunami coming in.  Yeah, look, on her ass.  That's how the wave went.  Did they audition people or just put an open call on the back of Village Voice?  If you have genitals, show up.  These are awful people.  So what was the line about Pat?  Oh, so I'm saying if Pat showed up and needed a place, I'm sure you'd put him up.  Sure I would if he would stand there and just make the faces he makes.  Like, he'll do like a little job.  I wish you could see this on the radio. 
[03:34:30]  It's like John Candy would make those little faces.  And, hmm, yeah, well, I'm endearing.  Yeah.  And it's like with every face Pat makes, it's less and less endearing.  And you want to just strike him.  I think that was him that sent in that feedback.  Yes, it was.  I would let Pat stay at my place.  There's not another Pat from Monaki.  Monaki.  I'd let him stay.  All right.  Well, should we take a break and continue?  They're about to have sex in a pool. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, is that it?  They're going to pool sex now?  Oh, this is Tommy Lee's house?  That is not a friend of yours.  What?  Huh?  That's Jimmy's friend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got braces.  What does she do for a living?  Where does she model?  Oh, no.  She works in, uh...  All right.  Now they're having sex in a pool, guys.  Look at this.  How old is she?  She's, um...  That's a 12-year-old.  Officers in the other room. 
[03:35:30]  That is...  Come on!  She has a little backpack.  Yeah, if you want to call it that.  Oh, look at this.  Sex in the pool.  There is nothing sexy about pool.  It's the Wade Boggs guy again and his awful spouse.  I hope they both drown.  Oh, please.  Please have eaten five minutes ago.  I want to see a scene from the William Shatner story in this pool.  Oh, dude.  You ever have somebody grab your junk underwater?  It's like...  It's such a not a smooth motion. 
[03:36:00]  No, it goes like...  There is nothing sexy about the pool.  Chlorinated water.  Worst lubricant ever.  It's awful.  You try to put it in.  It's like...  Oh, look.  They're so playful in the pool swimming under each other.  She just shoved her ass in his face.  This is terrible.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, God.  I didn't know the dog was going for a swim, too.  I've seen sexier water scenes at the Yates house.  This is awful.  Dude, her snack is so hairy. 
[03:36:30]  That looks like a sea urchin.  It looks like she has a brown jellyfish coming from the back.  Holy ass.  These are terrible people.  There should be shipwrecks in that.  This girl in the hair...  This girl in the hair thing better not come back in fashion because it's just awful.  Ugh.  Look at that.  This is an awful...  Gars on her belly.  Unsexy video.  All right, well...  This is awful.  People knock pornography.  This is what happens when you try to do it without the... 
[03:37:00]  What they call the immoral angle of pornography and you get shit.  Crap.  Garbage.  She's got an E.T. body.  Look at her.  She's terrible.  This is the worst.  She's terrible.  It's like watching someone go down on Bishop.  This is awful.  All right.  Well, there's another...  The better sexual techniques right there.  Maybe we should throw that one in for the last 20 minutes of the show.  Yeah, might as well. 
[03:37:30]  Let's see what kind of positions...  Oh, should we go for the advanced?  Where's the advanced sexual techniques video or did we break that one?  That's probably one of the ones we smashed.  Yeah, but Anscott, his version's over there unless he's taking them home with him.  No, I just have the music.  What are 10 secrets to great sex?  The other stuff's in the office.  These are just bad.  All right, well...  Oh, God.  They climbed out of the pool.  Now they're on the side.  She's trying to make rhyme or reason of his junk.  Yeah, he can't get a rod.  No.  She's laying on the gravel.  It's probably...  Look at her. 
[03:38:00]  She's like, come on, scumbag.  The movie...  Your cameras are rolling.  All right, well...  This is terrible.  He has Ben hair.  Oh, that's right.  The skimmers look like there's triples in there from Star Trek after these two get out.  Just messes.  Pool sex.  Pool sex is horrendous.  It's the worst.  Yeah, the human form doesn't look very good underwater.  It has that blue tinge to it.  And then look at her butt.  Like, her cheeks spread apart.  And it just looks like Davy Jones' locker. 
[03:38:30]  She's giving him, like, a handy on the side of the pool.  Like, what is sexy?  Do that in the bedroom.  Yeah, that's good.  She goes to give him a hammer.  Don't show that.  Don't show that.  Show her ass from the back with the hair flowing out of it.  Look at that hair flying around underwater.  Oh, she is...  Look at that hair.  She is awful.  It's like seaweed.  Oh, she's working his snorkel.  She's not even sexy licking his mule.  No.  Oh, she is just terrible.  In that nest. 
[03:39:00]  She's not committing to it at all.  No, she's just licking at it and pecking at it with her thin lips.  There should be a mother falcon throwing up into baby's beaks inside that snatch.  And this guy's...  Every time she strokes it, the more of this guy's hair is falling out of his head.  Falling into the water.  Oh, he really is awful.  Old nuclear radiation skull.  I mean, you know, I understand they wanted like a real, quote, couple, but, you know,  come on.  Could you get a guy packing more than five? 
[03:39:30]  I don't watch videos to see guys like me.  You know, I want to see guys that have mules that look like it was made with a camera trick  and a girl just struggling and crying.  This is awful.  All right, well...  Oh, that's it.  Okay.  Yeah.  The pool sex.  Another bust.  Sex in the office.  That's hot.  Wow, right.  That'll be video of, uh...  Anyway, um...  We should take a break.  Jesus.  Ugh.  Hope she brought her milk money.  Yeah, really, dude. 
[03:40:00]  We're a little distracted by your visitor.  Why?  She's a nice girl.  We'll continue in just a few minutes here.  Many young wives feel squeaky at the form of swallowing scenes.  Why?  Indeed, a man's jacket is full of valuable clothing.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  I want to stop here and gackle.  That's hot.  I got blood rushing in my mule right now.  That is so hot.  The best on TV are the commercials, especially the stupid ones, like the ones for Ex-Lax. 
[03:40:30]  Now, this is a laxative.  But in the commercial, they have this grown woman talking to her grown daughter.  They refer to Ex-Lax as their family's best friend.  Now, I wonder where they go for the holidays.  The next time that commercial is on, listen carefully to what the man says during the commercial.  He's talking about a laxative.  He says, and I quote,  It works while you sleep.  I don't want that.  I want to be up and awake. 
[03:41:00]  Ready to go.  Do you avail yourself today of the modern miracle medicines?  I don't take drugs.  I don't like drugs.  You don't use any drugs?  I don't use drugs.  So, well, what do you use instead of drugs, or if you need, if you have some illness or disease? 
[03:41:30]  Fruits, fruits, the elixir of life.  You mean fruits can cure diseases?  Fruits.  There's a fruit for any disease that mankind has had.  That's hard to believe.  Name the disease, I'll give you the fruit.  Really?  Absolutely.  Arterial sclerosis?  Bananas.  Bananas?  Bananas.  Because arterial sclerosis is hardening of the artery.  You need something soft.  Either bananas or a mushy pear.  Either one will save.  How about tuberculosis?  Tuberculosis?  TB.  Blueberries.  TB?  How?  Why?  They stain the tubercle bacteria. 
[03:42:00]  You find them, you kill them.  Blueberries.  How about diarrhea?  Diarrhea, you've got to eat peaches.  Peaches?  Peaches are very good.  Any kind of peaches?  Oh, no.  Not Alberta.  No?  Really?  No.  They're cling peaches.  Why?  I know why.  They hold you together a little bit.  Holy shit!  It's an Opie and Anthony Wow sticker stop.

Get that weak stuff out of here.  You hear that sound?  He shoots.  This is the hook.  It's time to take off the warm-ups.  College Basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  We have ACC, Big Ten, and Pac-10.  Round ball, baby.  It'll be a full slate on channels 180 through 188.  Huge rivalries.  ACC, North Carolina, and Duke.  Yeah, hills.  Yeah, hills.  Yeah, hills.  Blue double.  Arizona, UCLA.  Go Cats.  Go Cats. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, bro-ing.  Yeah, bro-ing.  Indiana and Purdue.  Who's wrong?  Who's wrong?  Boilermakers, Boilermakers, Boilermakers.  Oh, yeah.  And we have much more.  All season long, we're taking it hard to the hoop.  The offensive pressure continues.  That was a-  With College Basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  It's the ACC, Big Ten, and the Pac-10.  College Basketball on channels 180 through 188 on XM Satellite Radio.  No one will outscore us.  And we're back. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, new couples up to the-  Wow, that guy might have something he's packing there.  Yeah, at least he looks like he should be in a film, and so does she. 
[03:45:00]  This is Sex in the Office.  Really hot.  Are they saving the ringer couples for the end, I guess?  Yep.  I haven't had sex in this office yet.  Well, you might in about 20 minutes.  I hope so.  Martini Steve is kind of a-  What?  Why do you want to do that to me?  Speaking of Sex in the Office, Anthony, why don't we quickly play the sexual harassment  thing one more time here? 
[03:45:30]  Oh, I love this.  Sexual harassment.  Everybody has to go through a little course when you go get a new job these days.  Right?  Sure.  You get dragged in and have to go through that drivel of how you're not supposed to hang  up little things at your desk that others might find offensive.  Don't say, don't call anyone honey or sweetie, things like that.  You know, it's got to all be by the book now.  Very professional.  It's so, because what happened is, political correctness, like when I worked in an office,  I had this cute little thing I would hang on my desk. 
[03:46:00]  It was just a picture of an open vag, and it said, don't object to this, ladies.  It's the only reason I'm not choking you right now.  And all of a sudden-  Fun little joke.  A little joke.  Could have come from a Ziggy cartoon.  That's right.  A little clit hanging over a fence.  Ziggy stinks.  I hate the funny papers.  Funny papers.  The three years old.  Ah, funny papers.  I never laugh at the funny papers, unless it's Gary Larson is the only one. 
[03:46:30]  I like Brenda Starr.  I don't know Brenda Starr.  She hasn't aged in years.  Although Marmaduke always gets me.  Big dog.  Big dog.  Doing big dog things.  You know what would be funny if Marmaduke walked back in the house with the arm of a  four-year-old in his mouth?  That would be an interesting Marmaduke cartoon.  Ah, Marmaduke mauled another youngster.  Why is-  I mean, they still do the comics, huh?  They're terrible.  Give me the Daily News.  You're going to be like- 
[03:47:00]  Give me the Daily News.  Good luck getting through the advertising on this piece of shit paper.  You're going to be like Fiorello LaGuardia and read the funny papers to the people during  the strike?  Would he do that?  Yeah, something.  I don't even know where to find-  Who laughs at the funny papers?  Funny papers.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No one.  Well, we got the boondocks.  Stinks.  Hagar the Horrible.  Oh, always good for a laugh.  Where's our shipment of swords, he says, as the enemy's running down the hill with their  arrows flying at Hagar's head. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  And then his little minion says, the company sent this.  We are out of the items you ordered, but will restock within 30 days, at which time  we will ship them to you.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  This guy's nailing this chick in the office.  Hagar the Horrible.  Who would read that and chuckle good-naturedly to themselves?  How about Peanuts Classic? 
[03:48:00]  You just look awful railing a girl standing up like that.  Yeah.  You get that awful underslung ass look, like a hyena ass look, slung underneath your legs.  You gotta hunch down a little bit just to get the angle right.  Oh, hunkered.  Nice technique, dude.  Jesus.  This guy's good.  This guy's good.  He knows what he's doing.  He's a professional.  He's doing his long stroke.  And you got the tsunami waves rippling across her butt.  He's only packing like six and a half or seven, but compared to the other Asians in this video, 
[03:48:30]  he looks like a monster.  All right, here's a Peanuts Classic.  Peanuts are the worst.  They have to be Peanuts Classic.  The guy's dead.  I understand.  They're never funny.  Well, you got...  Never.  What's the little doggie's name?  Snoopy.  Oh, yeah.  Snoopy.  He's on his doghouse there.  You know what, Peanuts...  ...really pounding her.  Wow.  He's got one leg up.  One leg on the floor.  And he's spanking her.  We're not.  Is that supposed to be his secretary?  Yeah.  Wow, they ain't messing around. 
[03:49:00]  This is like hardcore penetration now.  Now they're showing some screwing.  Yeah, great.  The only Peanuts cartoon I ever laughed at was when Lucy was holding the football,  and Paul McCartney's wife went to kick it, and she moved it,  and that leg flew out and went 40 yards.  Wait, keep the audio up, dude.  That was only second to when Charlie Brown got Lucy pregnant.  And on the next panel, you see him motoring out on a boat into the...  All right, so Snoopy is on his doghouse there, Anthony. 
[03:49:30]  And he's thinking to himself, Woodstock gave me a tie for Christmas.  Uh-huh.  I suppose he'll be hurt if he doesn't see me wearing it at least once.  Okay.  So then he puts the tie on, and then Woodstock is there,  and Snoopy's thinking to himself,  I think he painted the pheasant himself. 
[03:50:00]  I don't even get that.  What?  Was that when Charles Schultz had Alzheimer's?  Hey, now she's giving him a little oral action.  That's corny porn oral.  It's not good.  That guy's a lot of spit.  He's got a mule, no?  Yeah, he's probably a pack of eight, but who cares?  He's got a bent banana.  Yeah.  All right, you want to...  Look at Ben holding the smoked sausage as he's watching this.  Yeah.  Ben, what are you doing? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  I'm playing with the sausage.  Sausage diva.  Sausage diva.  But this position makes it easier for him to raise your clearance or for you to catch yourself.  Wow, now she's moving.  She's going back with cowgirl.  Ben just hit Steve with a sausage.  He threw a sausage at Steve?  Are you crazy?  He goes like this to me.  He goes, watch this, and he throws it.  Maybe it was too undercooked for him,  and he just wanted to put it on the barbecue a little longer.  Steve, he purposely threw that at you. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, yeah, I purposely did.  Why would you throw that at the guy?  I was trying to throw it over his head, so it'd be funny.  What would be funny about hitting Steve with a sausage?  And if it went flying by Steve,  it was going to knock out the teenager that's outside the studio.  Yeah, what are you going to hit out my young friend for?  Do you want to hear one more, Anthony?  Maybe...  Oh, which one?  Beetle belly.  Oh, beetle belly's always good for a laugh.  Nope, don't fucking do it.  Why are you throwing stuff at the teenager?  Yeah, what are you throwing sausage for? 
[03:51:30]  I throw a sausage at the young girl.  What's the disguise for, beetle?  Oh.  What's beetle dressed like, Opie?  Yeah, Opie, describe the panel.  That's what LaGuardia did.  Well, beetle has a kooky hat on and a cigar,  and it looks like a fake mustache and maybe some glasses.  Or is that how he usually looks?  I don't remember what he looked like.  No.  Okay.  Sarge always picks on me.  I'm in hiding.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Mark's latrine duty.  Uh-huh.  And then Beetle says, now you're picking on Groucho. 
[03:52:00]  I just heard about Tony.  Is that it?  Yeah, because see, the sergeant said, okay, Marks, latrine duty,  because he looks like Groucho Marks now.  Why aren't you stomping Beetle Bailey's mustache off?  Private's weapon's name is Barber Duke, sir.  These are awful.  Oh, they're terrible.  Yeah.  Well, it's not the Sunday comics where they're all in color. 
[03:52:30]  Do you think that would be funny, though,  if Beetle Bailey was shooting the sergeant in the stomach?  Right there in the latrine?  Hysterical.  Oh, what?  Yeah.  I want you to...  Did we get a money shot?  No.  I don't think there's any work being done in this office today.  No.  No.  Bet you those papers are piling up, right, guys?  She's taking some dictation.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  That...  Hers and the inbox, both full. 
[03:53:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, she's rubbing the papers between her legs,  like to try to the office sexy?  No, she's got a vibrator,  and I think she's tickling his sack  every time it brushes against her ass  with the dildo.  Oh, this guy's really bugging me.  You can tell by his tan line,  he's a porn star or something.  Yep, of course.  He's got the bikini line to him.  And the fact that he's been standing up  and banging for 40 minutes  and that Wade Boggs had to close his eyes  laying by a pulley and a heifer rod  certainly separates the professionals 
[03:53:30]  from the amateurs.  That's true.  They're talking.  The business machines that come up with these days.  Ugh.  Now he's trying to do, like, comedy.  Yeah, the business machines.  Very good.  This is old,  because there's not a computer in that office.  Yeah, you're right.  She's got her 80s hairdo.  I think that's not his wife, by the way.  No.  Who works with your wife?  Is that supposed to be his wife?  No, it's the secretary.  Yeah, secretary.  Oh, while his wife's driving around 
[03:54:00]  and driving the kids around in the minivan.  Yeah, while his wife is backing two children  into a lake.  His wife was giving orals to the guy by the pool.  Yes.  That awful woman.  Come on, money shot.  Aimed it already.  What, are you going to do it all day?  This guy's bugging me.  He looks like Ralph Garci from Fame.  Could he hurry up?  Oh, the Fame passion.  This stinks.  He's got quite the rod on him. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, he's a porn star.  Bill and Jenny.  Nice.  A supporting hand will keep you from getting hurt.  Oh, all over the boss's blotter.  Most people don't wear shoes while having sex,  as Jenny does here.  Shoes can make your feet look sexy.  You might find it fun to keep your shoes on  once in a while.  Yeah, that's a good piece of input, stupid.  Keep your shoes on.  Shoes make your feet look sexy  if they're full of corns and warts and moles.  Or if you're in Japan.  I like the way they take care of those feet.  Bind them up. 
[03:55:00]  That's right.  This is good.  Melly Melsong.  Is he done?  Very good.  Is he done?  I'm done with that.  I don't know.  His hair is really awful.  All right.  Well, so the sexual harassment video?  Oh, right.  The audio for the sexual harassment video?  Yeah, everyone has had to sit through these stupid things  if you work for a corporation these days.  Because you can't be...  You've got to stay...  Toe the line.  Nothing out of line.  You can't say you look nice today 
[03:55:30]  or anything like that.  Chicks can come into work, I don't know,  dressed in little jeans and braces  and backpacks and stuff.  And, you know, you've got to be nice.  Yes.  Why does she have braces?  I don't know.  Just some people have braces.  I like braces.  Although, normally, I prefer them on the legs.  Well, let's take a listen to this sexual harassment audio.  This is for all the new people  that got XM Satellite Radio for Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  A lot of people haven't heard this yet. 
[03:56:00]  You hear about sexual harassment on TV  and it makes the headlines in newspapers.  As an employee, what do you need to know about it?  First, sexual harassment is against the law.  And it's against your company's policy.  So, what is sexual harassment?  Linda, you are doing a fine job here.  Oh, well, thank you, Steve.  But, you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work. 
[03:56:30]  I'm sorry?  I mean, we're talking about your job here.  There may be physical harassment.  Wow.  You're really tense today, Nancy.  Ow, Bill!  Sorry.  You looked really tense.  You know, I really don't like it when you do that.  Can you please stop?  I'll never stop, Nancy.  Never.  In some instances, the harassment may be verbal. 
[03:57:00]  Word around the office is you've got a fat cock.  It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings.  Man, I could go for a power fuck right now.  Man, I could go for a power fuck right now. 
[03:57:30]  Change is slow, and what was acceptable in common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment.  It smells like vagina in here.  It smells like vagina in here.  It smells like fresh vagina in here.  Are you talking about my vagina? 
[03:58:00]  Maybe.  Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect.  Treat your coworkers with the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.  It's your company's policy, and it's the law.  How come nobody dumps in these stupid shoots?  Yeah, they're still going at it in the office on the screen there.  We're running out of show.  Let's do a couple what-did-we-learns on the O&A show today. 
[03:58:30]  Let's go to Rob.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Rob.  How you doing, Boo-Boo?  I'm fine, Angel Face.  How are you?  I'm great.  Yeah, I learned that Norton doesn't like his nipples pinched.  He likes them gently tickled.  Nice line, you shit dick.  Let's go to Anthony.  Anthony, what did you learn on the show today?  A lot.  Oh, sorry.  I learned that the only thing hotter than putting teen before something is wearing braces after.  Yes. 
[03:59:00]  I think we have a teen wearing braces outside the studio that came here to visit Norton.  I had an oops for 2004.  Yeah.  Howard Stern turning into an old woman.  Yeah, he is looking more and more like an old woman.  It's a little strange.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Bye, fella.  Let's go to Mitch in Jersey.  What's up, Mitch?  Hey, how we doing?  Hey.  Hi, Mitch.  I learned that animals have ugly dicks.  And?  And I got one more.  Ben looks like a poorly edited film when he moves. 
[03:59:30]  Poorly spliced, sir.  Spliced.  Yeah, Ben looks like a poorly spliced film.  Oh, spliced.  Yeah, exactly.  He caught him as he hung up on.  Oh, spliced.  That's what I baited stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Blast off.  Blast off.  You're in the house or on the beach or in the office.  Your Delphi XM SkyFi is in your car.  You know, there's a simple solution for this.

I watch too much CNN, man.  I don't know if you've ever sat around and watched CNN longer than, say, 20 hours in one day.  I don't recommend that. 
[04:01:00]  Watch CNN headline news for one hour.  It's the most depressing thing you'll ever fucking do.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression.
