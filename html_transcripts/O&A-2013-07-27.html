<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an in-studio interview with former boxing champion Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini.  Mancini discussed his career, his retirement at 24 due to a loss of desire, the tragic fight with Duk Koo Kim, his post-boxing life in entertainment and producing, and the documentary about his life, "The Good Son." He also shared details about his family, particularly his brother Lenny's struggles and death, and his upbringing in the tough, blue-collar environment of Youngstown, Ohio, including its connection to organized crime.

Following the interview, the hosts launched into a discussion about numerous news stories detailing fast-food employees engaging in sexual misconduct with food, including graphic descriptions of placing genitalia on food and posting pictures online.  Listener calls further detailed instances of food tampering, such as spitting in food, adding bodily fluids, and other unsanitary practices.  The discussion was filled with graphic descriptions and crude jokes.

Next, a "Worst of the Week" segment focused heavily on Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal, then currently unfolding during his mayoral campaign.  The hosts, along with Sam Roberts, discussed Weiner's past and newly revealed sexts, reenacting some with a staff member and intern. They played clips from Weiner's press conference and highlighted the absurdity of his situation, his alias "Carlos Danger," and the hypocrisy of his actions.

Comedian Colin Quinn then joined the show, discussing his Just for Laughs keynote speech and various career anecdotes, including turning down an Austin Powers role.  Chris DiStefano, a contributor to the after-show, also appeared, sharing humorous and violent tales from his life.  Numerous advertisements aired throughout this portion.

The show then shifted to a discussion about the evolution of strip clubs, comparing older, seedier establishments with newer, upscale "gentleman's clubs," touching on organized crime's involvement.  Personal anecdotes about experiences in various clubs, including attempts at sex during lap dances, were shared.  Colin Quinn again appeared, discussing his career, SNL, and near-miss with Austin Powers.  John Mulaney joined, discussing his upcoming marriage and the challenge of broaching a prenuptial agreement with his fiancée, leading to humorous banter about prenuptial agreements and celebrity marriages.  Joe DeRosa joined, initiating a running joke about performing oral sex on a person with a penis.  The conversation became increasingly sexually explicit and vulgar, with Bob Kelly also mentioned and participating. The segment concluded with the "Worst of the Week" countdown, highlighting DeRosa's on-air declaration as the number one moment.

A subsequent segment focused on a friend's relationship with a pre-operative transsexual woman, with graphic descriptions of her anatomy and the friend's reluctance to share photos.  The conversation frequently used vulgar and offensive language and veered into tangents about an eye injury, post-operative transsexual vaginas (including graphic descriptions and anecdotes), and Anthony Weiner's continued sexting scandal.  A call from Bill Burr followed, focusing on stand-up comedy challenges, generational differences, and interactions with social media critics.  The conversation included tangents about a documentary on Nazi descendants and various personal anecdotes.

The final segment covered weightlifting, with humorous descriptions of body fat and gym routines.  A host's experience working in his father's dental office and aversion to airport body scanners, including a detailed description of a TSA pat-down, was discussed.  Bill Burr's podcast, a text message misunderstanding, and the movie *Pope of Greenwich Village* were discussed, along with podcast production values and technological frustrations.  The hosts then discussed their "Arctic Adventure" special, focusing on a remote individual, his lifestyle, comparing him to the subject of *Into the Wild*, and discussing encounters with bears and a Siberian community.  The conversation concluded with reflections on human nature, encompassing both cruelty and kindness, and the reversion to primal behavior without societal structures.  The segment featured extensive vulgar language.

[00:05:30]  no no never on this no man we would remember ray boom boom mancini  take a seat sir how are you sir good very good thank you you look like you you could still fight  oh i can give you four good ones  i can't see that four good ones  i can give you four i can give you four rounder but after that no shot  yeah what did you do the first thing to go is at the cardio 
[00:06:00]  no oh well um oh i'm on i didn't realize  you know we do that all the time  um no no this isn't so much the cardio is i think it's the desire  oh really yeah once you lose the desire you know you go  it's like people said uh how did you know it was time to retire  i said well here's the difference when i was fighting people the reporters used to say  boom boom we hear you're you're getting up you're in the morning when it's blizzard snow  pouring rain trencher range you're out there doing road work  and i said yeah and they said why i said because i know the other guy ain't 
[00:06:30]  huh and if he is he better be  here's when you know it's time to retire i'd get up praying for rain  it's raining  oh good  you're looking for the excuse  is the desire like  90 of it i mean  absolutely it's a mindset absolutely yeah  you hear it all the time but truly is look i got i got talent you got talent you can fight  it's about who's you know got that certain it's a mindset  that you can take it to a different level  uh-huh  and um but for me especially my style fighting was not made for a long career  you know i'd be in top shape you know i'm gonna keep coming taking punches to give punches 
[00:07:00]  yeah  that's a certain mindset you have to have  if you don't have the desire and determination  or willing to pay the dues to go through that  you know then you you know that's what i said that  then you gotta shut it down  yeah and that's what i said when i lost love for the game and um  i i lost love for the game actually for every type of instance after that fight i lost love for the game  but you know i had the title chance to you know hold on to get my security  uh-huh  fighting for a couple years and i fought still as hard as i could and  and still beating guys knocking guys out things like that 
[00:07:30]  but um  after after the second fight with bramble i  i just had no love for it no more and i didn't do that fight i was  that was gonna be my last fight  and um time to shut it down man  i mean the one thing i'm most proud of i only fought five and a half years as a pro  not a long fight at 34 fights  34 fights in five and a half years  uh-huh  a lot of fights  but the one thing i'm most proud of is i can still spell fight  yeah  and i say to have joke of me because so many guys can't  so many guys right  you only fought for five and a half years  that's it  yeah  that's that's incredible to me 
[00:08:00]  wow  and how old were you when you retired  24  24  when you retired from boxing  you knew at 24  now you would think that's at the top of your game  but again yeah i was  you know i  i always said i never became the fighter i wanted to become until the end of my career  but i had already lost the love for the game  you know i already lost the love  wow but that early though you would think that might happen  wait you couldn't sit around for a year and find the love again  for those paydays  well it's the difference  my style  i said if i had a style that's you know 
[00:08:30]  a boxer you know i wasn't  uh-huh  right  but my style was like i said fan friendly style  you come forward  just get in there and swing  and duke it out  yeah it's gonna be you know  you're gonna make a score for a couple years  you're gonna  you know  people expect a certain  you know  when i  people expect a certain style  when they knew i was fighting  they knew what i was gonna give them  uh-huh  and once you ain't willing to give them that no more  you're only  you're cheating the fans as well as yourself  yeah  hey ray let me ask you this  were a lot of people shocked when you retired at 24 though  i think so  i think uh 
[00:09:00]  some guy said  you probably retired before that  oh shit  it's like a guy said to me  he said  when you retire  i said uh  you know  august of uh 85  i was 24  he said  i thought you retired two fights before that  but you know  basically uh  i think so  i think uh  people don't realize  that i was so young  but  what i do appreciate is that  because i was fighting so regularly  a lot of people remember my fights  and they think that i fought longer  yeah  fought longer  and you also obviously  hopefully you save money and everything  yeah 
[00:09:30]  i was very fortunate  i came out of a good  and like i said  that's one chapter of my life  and i knew that  i mean  that's not my life  boxing wasn't my life  it was one chapter of my life  there was other things i wanted to do  and i knew that early on  so what'd you do from 24 to today  you know  i i went in  i got into the entertainment business  i've been represented by william morse at the time  and they offered me acting gigs  you know  and i never was able to take advantage  then i  then i went and auditioned for  for a movie  uh  not long after the second grandma fight  and i said man  the camera don't punch back  well actually before the second grandma 
[00:10:00]  the second grandma fight  the camera don't punch back  the worst thing that happens  was take two  i said man  why didn't i do this earlier  you know  and that's when i really said okay  and my agent said  you got to be where it's at  so of course  you know  as they say  if you're going to go fishing  you got to go to the water  so i moved to la  and um  i've been out there for 28 years  and um  i'm enjoying it  you know  i'm not where i'm going to be  not where i want to be  but i've been fortunate  to to work  to film  tv  stage  but i'm mainly now  concentrating on producing  and to me that's the juice  you know 
[00:10:30]  to me taking something from nothing  taking it through fruition  seeing it up on screen  that's the juice for me  and the documentary i saw is great  it's called uh  the good son  and it's your story  and uh  it's ultra video on demand  on july 16th  and it's in theaters  august 9th  and uh  it's really great  i mean uh  you sound  he sounds like bob gullib  i don't know if he's a comedian  bob's a good friend of mine  oh you know bob  bobby's from sharon pa  right over the border  i did bobby's podcast  that long ago  oh jeez  bobby's a good friend for years  it's all i thought of  watching the documentaries  how him and gollum  it's the same fucking 
[00:11:00]  bobby's going to the right  that's  but that's  i had some  some fights  what's his excuse  exactly  nothing  bob is a psychopath though  bob gollum's a fucking psychopath  but it's that part of the country  is a very tough  like sharon pennsylvania  youngstown  is a very very  fucking tough part  what makes it so tough  you think  well blue collar town  we were sick  a lot of blue collar towns  but  sickam is still producing city  but you know  it's a blue collar  still mill town  you know  you get what you give 
[00:11:30]  you know  and  we're in the city  youngstown  we're the only city  of our size  anywhere in the country  i mean there might be others  i don't know of any  that's controlled by  two major mob families  and has been forever  pittsburgh and cleveland  so forever  when you grow up  in that atmosphere  which that's part of life  everyday life  and you know  guys  people  are still workers  and when  when meals were shut down  and people got meaner  you know  it's not like they advocate  you know  go to new york  being an actor  be a singer  or be a dj  or a radio host  or anything like that 
[00:12:00]  it was you know  get married  go to work in the mill  get married  raise a family  and that was great  solid  solid earth people  best people i know  i just knew  i wanted something different  and i said  i can't do that man  i watched my father  go to sweat factory  i used to get up  you know  he'd get me up in the morning  before school  i'd do road  so i'd do road work  he'd give me a kiss  walk out the door  walk to him  we lift two houses  from the corner  blizzard snow  pouring rain  i look at it  i go oh god  i can't do that  oh wow  i gotta make it  as a fight  i can't do that  eddie o'neill  ed o'neill 
[00:12:30]  from modern family  from youngstown  eddie's a different  from youngstown  and we talk about it  all the time  and eddie said  he became an actor  because  it's a funny story  he was you know  a pittsburgh stealer  he was in their  training camp  1970  he made it to the last  cut  as a linebacker  and he said  he always says  it was the day that  or it was that 69  it was the day that  Neil Armstrong  the day he got cut  was the day  Neil Armstrong  walked on the moon  he said  good day for him  not such a good day  for me  he said  but  he went back  to youngstown  he started working  at a bar  that he had frequented 
[00:13:00]  in his whole life  and he looked around  and he saw everybody  they were there  for guys that were  lifers there  you know  30, 40 years  he said  that's going to  become me  I can't do it  so he borrowed  some money  he said  I'm going to New York  and try to be an actor  I mean that's  that's  he's in the documentary  too  edo neil  he talks a lot  and Mickey Rourke  is in the documentary  Mickey's great  Ray Leonard  so I can't say much  I appreciate these guys  doing it  Mickey  I love Mickey  and the fact that  he agreed to do it  and Eddie of course  and Ray did it  I mean  it's special  it's very special 
[00:13:30]  and your dad was a fighter  too  so much I didn't know  about you  my father was a much  better fighter than I was  my father was a great  fighter in the 30s and 40s  he was a great fighter  at a time of a lot  of great fighters  and because of World War 2  didn't get opportunities  to fight for the world title  he signed the fight  for the world title  a month before  he signed the fight for it  he was drafted  into World War 2  and he said  look I mean  I want to defend my country  I just want the opportunity  to fight for the title  and he said  in fact I'll give my  entire purse  to the Army Relief Fund  which at that time  was crying for money  he said no man  we don't want your money  we want you 
[00:14:00]  and consequently  he never got a chance  to fight for the title  and all I heard about growing up  was how my father  should have been  could have been  would have been  world champion  because he already  beat Sam  and got in a non-title fight  and that's what  got him in a title fight  and my father  never talked bad  he was very proud  to defend his country  it was one of the greatest  things he said  he ever did  he said  but he always  he never talked  about regrets  but once in a while  he said  you know Raymond  he said  if I had only had  the chance  I would have won  that title  oh wow  and you could see  how  he never talked  bad about it  just because 
[00:14:30]  he had bothered him  but since I was  a little boy  when I used to hear  those stories  people would say  what do you want  to be when you grow up  I said  I want to be a  fighting world champion  for my father  and that's all I ever wanted  and he's the one  who never wanted me to fight  he's the one  who tried to talk me  out of it in the worst way  especially when I was  in high school  and we were going  to turn pro  I said  I want to turn pro  you know  he said Raymond  it was depression  I had to eat  I had to fight  you have so many  other opportunities  because I had athletic  as well  academic scholarship  to go to college  I had a professional  baseball offer  I had other opportunities  he said  I had to fight  I said  I want to win the title  I want to win it for you 
[00:15:00]  and I'm just fortunate  and blessed  to live out my dream  you know  and people say  I used to have  reporters who say  well boom boom  if you didn't make it  as a fighter  what would you have done  I said  I can't answer that  because that's all  I ever wanted  I never  I can't answer it  there's nothing else  I ever wanted  so you know  I said look  I moved to New York  I wouldn't have went  back home  I've been the best  bust out waiter  there was in New York  but I wasn't going home  unless I was successful  and I meant that  well you had a brother  your brother Lenny  and he was also 
[00:15:30]  a very good fighter  yeah much better fighter  than me  he was a much better fighter  guys people  you know  I said in the documentary  in the gym  will tell you  guys who saw  better fighters  hit harder  better boxer  slicker  but my brother  he loved the streets  and you know  my brother was a street guy  and you know  better fighter than I was  but as I said  in the documentary  the one thing  he lacked  that I had  was discipline  my brother was a handsome  son of a gun  and the women loved him  and he loved to party  and you know  but when he trained  he trained hard  but it was in between  you know  people don't understand 
[00:16:00]  it's in between fights  in between tournaments  you know  that you gotta live  a righteous lifestyle  and Lenny was partying  too much  and who worked  in the steel mills  when the steel mills  shut down  he was looking for things  and he got caught up  with the wise guys  and he was collecting  and that foolishness  and I'd say Lenny  man come on  come with me  you'll be with me  there was times  he was tapped out  didn't have money  he was a divorced father  paying child support  you know  his ex-wife  wouldn't let him 
[00:16:30]  see the child  he said Lenny  I'll give you money  he said  Raymond  you're my younger brother  I'm supposed to  take care of you  man don't worry about it  you're my brother  and you try to talk to him  you see where he's going  you see where he's headed  you know  and nothing ever good  comes out of that  growing up  knowing those guys  and growing up  you know  he just said  man  I wanted something different  and if he would have  just held on  for a little longer  he would have been with me  when I hit  right after that  things started happening  for me 
[00:17:00]  you know  God gives  God takes  God took Lenny  but he gave me  the opportunity  after that  and if he would have  held on  he would have been  with me  in my training camp  we had a great time  together  and your brother  passed away  because of  I guess the lifestyle  in the documentary  you address it  and it was very interesting  because there was  some facts around that  that were a little bit  dicey  yeah there was  and the detectives  they said  look Raymond  we can get into 
[00:17:30]  we can go into this  and do you really want us to  I said no  don't bring him back  and I don't want to  put my parents through that  I don't want to put them through it  don't bring him back  who cares  he's gone  that's the bottom line  I knew the general facts  I didn't need to know  the particulars  and you got to move on  from that  and that's the thing  I'll tell you  after we buried him  a couple days  the day after we buried him  I came back to New York  and that was the hardest  day of my life  leave my parents  my father broke down  on my arms  my father never cried  that's my father  cried as a kid 
[00:18:00]  my father said  the last time he cried  when he was 10 years old  he said  when his father left  and my grandmother split  he said  you stay here  and take care of your mother  I gotta go  and he wanted to go  with his father  and he said  Raymond  I cried so much  that dad  could never cry again  and I never saw him  and I think a lot of boys  don't see their father  cry  but that day  he broke down  in my arms  like a child  he was just wailing  and I said  man I ain't gotta go  dad  no  you gotta get on  with your life  you gotta get on  you gotta leave  you gotta leave  and I think 
[00:18:30]  at that moment  I mean that's  to me  those are the moments  you remember  how I got to the title  those are moments like that  you have to overcome  to get in that car  to go to Pittsburgh  to get on the plane  man that was the hardest  thing in my life  how did you keep  the discipline  with that  I'm sure you were offered  you know  that type of lifestyle  yourself  and it seemed  at the time  especially as young  as you were  it probably seemed  like an easy way  to make a few bucks  what's the difference  you see it  again  you see it early on  you see guys 
[00:19:00]  they put fathers  who were  who wasn't  you know  I'd be sitting  when I was fighting  they were all proud of me  they never  they were very proud of me  if we'd go out  after a fight  back in town  I'd be sitting here  the DJ  from the radio station  would be here  the city official  would be there  the guy  was a major  major guy  would be sitting here  all having a drink  because in Youngstown  how we looked at it  is everyone's carrying  the lunch belt  to their job  it's just different jobs  it's just different jobs  it's a lifestyle man  it's a grind 
[00:19:30]  everyone has to make a living  that's just how  they made their living  so one thing  that had nothing  to do with the other  your life  and my life  we didn't conflict  with each other  you know  good neighbor  my neighbor  was the fact  that people  were proud of you  and you knew that  did that want to keep you  from getting into  a bad lifestyle  but again  I said I was disciplined  that never intrigued me  that lifestyle  never intrigued me  I knew  I was intrigued  reading about  El Capone  Lucky Luciano  they were like  modern day cowboys  and being of Sicilian heritage  and I knew my grandfather 
[00:20:00]  when he came from Sicily  that's the life he got into  because he had to make a living  but that's not the lifestyle  I wanted  I wanted other things  like I said  they were proud of me  they come to all my fights  all the glitterati  all the glitterati  would sit at ringside  everybody wanted a flash  and that was great  but they supported me  so it was good  Youngstown was a great city  man  it still is  sounds wild  in the 70s  it was like the wild west  a lot of comfort 
[00:20:30]  between the two families  but Youngstown's a great city  wouldn't want to grow up  any other place  man  it was a great  great place to grow up  is it still corrupt?  maybe you don't want to  answer that  obviously  the people are still there  but there's nothing  to fight over now  the city was shut down  there's nothing  I mean  I go back home  and I ask friends  who is and who isn't  it's Raymond  there's nothing here  you know what I mean  yeah  the guys are still around  most of them died  but they're still around  but there's nothing 
[00:21:00]  to fight over  there's nothing going on  so you know  yeah  so I mean  it's not as prevalent  as it once was  but yeah  of course  it's still  the presence is still there  and you focus  a good piece  of the documentary  because I mean  after all these years  I know you're so  not sick of it  but you've covered  Dooku Kim  and you know  you've discussed it enough  but I was impressed  that you dedicate  a piece of the documentary  because a guy who  okay  yes he died in the ring  but that just becomes 
[00:21:30]  a footnote  or an anecdote  that people tell  but it's like  you really show him  as a person  and you get into his  family  and his trainers  and you make him  a real  and relatable person  which was  I thought really great  that you did that  I thought  well first of all  when Mark Kriegel  did the book  he said  look man  this is a book  about your life  that's one part of your life  you're going to have to go there  he said  I'm going to have to go  every dark place  you don't want to go  the death of your brother  the death of Kim  your divorce  he said  I'm going to have to go  but he said  you've got no say so  when I write  but you've got to trust me 
[00:22:00]  if you want the best story  about fathers and sons  I'm your guy  and I know what type of writer he was  and I trust him  he's an artist man  I love Mark  we're connected  I don't want to connect  to him forever  though I want to choke him  sometimes  did he write down  anything that you got annoyed at?  probably  oh we go out  when we were on the book  oh yeah  he's a pain in the ass man  but I love him  you know what I mean  but he's a pain in the ass  and so  but  I wouldn't want anybody  I couldn't ask for a better writer  I wouldn't want nobody else to write  he was still a guy  you know  but  you know  so when you  but he'd say 
[00:22:30]  that's one fact  I'm not  I'm not talking about your life  your grandfather comes from Sicily  and he said  look  it's a father  about fathers and sons  you and your father  your father with his father  when it came from Sicily  you and your children  and ultimately  me and my father  I said my father  I want to become a writer  because my father was an English major  but  so he uses  other than me and my father  I think the city of Youngstown  has as big  or as important a character  in the book  as anybody  and that's what I think  Jesse James Miller  the director of the film  who was also  one of the artists  you know  did with the film 
[00:23:00]  he made the town relevant  he made it as much  as a character  as anybody else  and  again  with the documentary  people talk about  the Kim incident  Kim meeting  the fiancé  and the son of Kim  but it's a 90 minute doc  and we don't get into  I don't meet him  until 60 minutes into it  so it's an hour about me  growing up in Youngstown  and my family  why I want to be a fighter  for my father  then we get into that  so I think it was  so well done  tastefully done  and edited  by Jesse  and his crew  that you're right  that is an important part 
[00:23:30]  and that's the way  they handled it  and you know  the day they told me  that G1  wanted to meet me  I mean  that was his son  Kim  yeah  absolutely  and the fiancé  young me  G1 wanted to meet me  and Mark Kriegel said  do you have a problem  I said no  I think it was important  I wanted to meet him  I wanted him to have some closure  and for me  it would put closure  some closure to me  because I always wondered  about the boy  and the fiancé  and that day  that we met  and so  you know  we're setting it up  to camera  and they're telling me 
[00:24:00]  I'm sitting around  the stoop of my home  and tell me  he's on his way  I told Mark  I said Mark  you better sit up  do you want  because you got one shot  I can't do this again  right  I can't go through this  hey Camino  cut take two  no  got one shot  you better get what you get  and that's what  it did  and  it was really well done  and do you feel like  because  it's all reporters  talk about  and do you feel like  it just  it unfairly  defined your career  I don't say unfairly  I understood it  but like I said  I like to think  I'm known for much more 
[00:24:30]  than that  I understand  it's always best known  well  I'm best known  for winning the world title  defending it four times  you know  fighting to win the title  for my father  fighting for the honor  of my city of Youngstown  I like to think  there's a lot more things  I like to think  I had a pretty good career  absolutely  but I understand  don't get me wrong  I understand  but that fight's  going to stand out  it's just such an odd thing too  because I mean  obviously there are tragedies  in every sport  you know  you can look at auto racing  and what not  it just seems  boxing is so much more personal  it's on a personal 
[00:25:00]  level  that  people are  I guess  more fascinated by  in some  like macabre way  I think  because it goes back  to the old gladiator days  exactly  but you have to understand  and part of it is  because at the time  I was like  you know  I was  as Irving Wood said  I was the all American boy  when a touch of mozzarella  you know  this was prime  Irving Wood said  this was prime time  Saturday afternoon  I was a big  you know  a ratings guy  for you know  CBS  I was on network television  so I had a great fan base  boom  but here's what people 
[00:25:30]  were saying  nobody knew until after a fight  and the thing is  the unfortunate part is  other than the ending  of the fight  it was a great fight  yeah  we want to fight  you see on ESPN Classic  all the time  but because of that  there's nothing good about it  right  and so  so I understand now  like at the time  at our time  yeah  I understand now  I went down at the time  how did you remedy that  with yourself  well I rely on my faith  I have a strong conviction  in my relationship with God  you know 
[00:26:00]  being grown up  in a Catholic high school  parochial school  12 years  you learn that  you know  to have that relationship  and that's the only thing  that got me through  and it's the only thing  that carries me through  my life today  through any hard time  and  I  you know  I say my prayers  every morning  every night  and I leave it  in God's hands  you know  I'm not trying to get  the philosophical thing  but that's  my faith  carries me through  exactly  do you want to ask  something  I want to  just let the people know  that he helps  ex-fighters too  I think that should be said  yeah  you got an organization  yeah  I'm part of the 
[00:26:30]  boxers  the retired boxers  association  and it's great  my friend Alex Ramos  from the Bronx here  started it  years ago  and we try to help  fighters  and I'm part of  also Ring 8  and Ring 10  right  which are here  in New York  based in New York  and these are guys  that do  businessmen  that put the money  into a pot  and help fighters  that's  I'm very proud  to be part of  a lot of fighters  have horrible lives  and these guys  go out  during the holidays  they have money  to make sure  to take care of these guys 
[00:27:00]  if they have  doctor bills  that take care of these guys  so Ring 8  and Ring 10  is a wonderful  wonderful organizations  they are wonderful  organizations  and if anybody  here knows of it  or wants to be part of it  it should be part of it  because they have  monthly meetings  and great  great ex-fighters  and people  part of the business  come and talk  on a monthly basis  and I'll be there  September 10th  for Ring 10  and I'm actually  I'm so looking forward  to it  it's been a while  since I've been back  but it's just  we have to look out 
[00:27:30]  for our own  because we don't have  any unions  we don't have  there's no union boxing  so we have to look out  for each other  and basically  whatever you made  in fighting  you're going to have  to parlay that  into something else  and it sustains you  for a lifetime  you said something  very interesting too  in the fight  you were talking about  the Kim fight  you said  I in that moment  know him better  than his fiancee  or his kids  or anybody who knows him  what is that relationship  when you're fighting a guy  you guys are sharing  some weird thing  that no one else 
[00:28:00]  around them can understand  I'm glad you brought that up  because people say  what is it when you're in there  with another guy  I said  I may have  never met this guy before  never seen him again  but for those moments  I know him better than anybody  because you know what's that  deep in his soul  because you know  it's an animalistic nature  of the business  I know  we both know  what we're trying to accomplish  I have something  he wants it  I'm trying to keep  from getting it  that whole thing  and how you go about it  so that's why you always  see fighters  hug after fight  you know  may have to be at war  but you hug afterwards 
[00:28:30]  because you have  such a mutual respect  and admiration  for each other  and what we're trying  to accomplish  and you know  and then you go  your separate ways  how much can you tell  before the fight  right before the fight  by looking  at a man's face  how much can you tell  about his fear  his ambition  to beat you  well some guys  you could  and the other guys  you look and you know  you know it's going to be a headache  the fight with Kim  I used to  his dressing room  was right next to mine  and sometimes they're not  but sometimes they are  and before that  you could hear him  and when I'm under 
[00:29:00]  you know  I like a little piece of quiet  and we're sitting there  and I'm kind of meditating  and I'll say  ah  bang bang  he's punching the walls  punching lockers  oh no  and all of a sudden  when my team looks  and we start to get  real wide eyed  I go oh man  we're in for a tough one  today aren't we  and that's just  but I knew what I was up against  you know  I had the mindset  you know  I prepared for war  my style was not  coming forward  like I said  it was going to be a war  but I prepared for war  you got to go  you know  I used to say things like  you're going to have to  kill me to beat me  for this time  you feel that way 
[00:29:30]  as a fighter  I'm willing to die  for my title  you mean that  but subconsciously  obviously  no you don't want that  I'll fight to the end  if I have to  and I would  but you say things like that  and then you realize  after something like that happens  man  you really got to watch  what you say  man  sometimes people can will  what they say  right  right  yeah  yeah  I mean  here's what people  understand  which you'll find out  in the documentary too  is that  before the fight  he had a  and his trainer talks about it  and his  his sparring partner talks about it 
[00:30:00]  he had a coffin  next to his bed  and I said  what's that  he said  either I'm coming home in that  or Mancini's going home in that  holy shit  and you go  and my daughter said to me  she said  Poppy  did you know that  I said no man  good thing I didn't  wow  because that would have changed  if I'd have known that  I don't know if I would have gotten ring  you know what I mean  if you'd have thought like that  but I know  that  their mindset  you know  he had that  that warrior mentality  I know what it is to have that mentality  but  I never thought like that  you know  right 
[00:30:30]  you just want to win  I'll do whatever it takes to win  you know that type of thing  yeah yeah  and  and  and it's scary  as after you think about it now  and then he wrote on the lampshade  kill or be killed  the day before the fight  wow  it's after  it's very eerie  after the fact  it is  yeah  they are telling us  that Ray has to leave  oh man  why  you got another interview  you probably have other interviews  I thought I was  auditioning for a show here man  please  we can talk to you  till 10 o'clock  this is fucking great 
[00:31:00]  I don't watch it at all  yeah  the documentary is  The Good Son  it's excellent  I've seen it  it's obviously  Ray's story  and it's what you're hearing right here  it's very honest  and open  and it's just  you're just a nice man  that's how you know  Ray's a fucking  a punching machine  because he's a nice man  who likes to fight  and he got out of it  still with his handsome face  look at him  look at you  thank you so much  thanks so much for coming in  this was great  the worst of the week

[00:36:30]  you know  Opie and Anthony  covered everything this week  you're not going to miss  a god damn thing  but first  I hate  when you hear stories  about food  tampering  in the food service industry  like when  shitty fast food workers  you know  rub their dick on food  and all that  I hate those news stories  but a couple of them  came out this week  we ended up talking  about those  taking calls  from people  that were fucking food  for some reason  I don't know  if it's the caliber  of people  that get hired  by fast food restaurants 
[00:37:00]  but all they want to do  is have sex  with the food  that they're serving us  it's disgusting  especially for someone  like me  who can't stop eating it  and by the way  just because I know  it's being fucked now  doesn't mean I will  stop eating it  it's dicks in fast food  on the worst of the week  counter  number six  what's going on  at subway  another guy 
[00:37:30]  fucking with the food  I see  Sam Roberts  oh boy  who was the last guy  I can't keep track  of these  well there was a guy  a few years back  there was the guy  who was like  and then he was taking  a bath in the sink  at Burger King  or KFC  what was the recent one  though  I forget already  that was Taco Bell  wasn't it  yeah  oh he was licking  the taco shells  I think  yeah he was licking  taco shells  that's disgusting  most people bother  by that  that just makes me laugh  but there's some guy 
[00:38:00]  somewhere just licking  taco shells  taco shells  well we got a new one  yeah  at subway  yeah  they fired an employee  who put his penis  on sandwich bread  and posted pictures  on Instagram  oh this fucking guy  you gotta laugh at that  he's  no because  he made a look  if you get that sandwich  I eat at subway  I'll take the chance  you might get a dick sandwich  oh he's just pressing that  he's just making a helmet head  in your bread 
[00:38:30]  so what what's wrong with that  he's fucking making  he's making a sandwich  yeah he's just  he's just pressing  his helmet in  I don't want to worry  about getting  like taco or dick bread  you're not gonna get sick  you're just gonna laugh  there's two breads  they look like  fucking peckers  oh gosh  Jim with the peckers  Jim with the fucking peckers  ah shit  he's a guy out of  Columbus, Ohio  and he writes 
[00:39:00]  my name is  Ian Jett  on Twitter  and I will be  your sandwich artist today  read a caption  that accompanied  the not suitable  for work picture  that appeared  on Jett's feed  how do you spell Jett  I wanna follow him  J-E-T-T  when confronted  about the picture  Jett tried to clarify  his reason for sharing  the image of him  draping his penis  over the foot  oh come on  that's right  I wish that a newspaper  article would say  that I could drape  my penis over something  that's very impressive  I would never do that 
[00:39:30]  at work  it was at home  oh now he's  backtracking  he said he did it  at home  with those  fucking things  you don't have  those things  at home  this isn't something  I'd ever do  at Subway  it was totally  a joke  I would never  put my dick  on the bread  at Subway  that's horrible  I only do that  at home  why would you  do it at home  and then eat  your own dick  sandwich  fuck yeah  you do that  amen  oh my god  as if seeing 
[00:40:00]  a man's penis  resting atop  the restaurant  sandwich bread  isn't enough  bad PR  for a single  news cycle  a second employee  at the same  Subway  also posted  a picture  of what he  purported to be  his own  frozen urine  yeah  where is this  what subway  is this  that's his  frozen urine  right there  and it says  today at work  I froze my pee  it looks like  a creamsicle  a frozen  creamsicle  fucking assholes  today at work  I froze my pee  there it is  it should be

[00:44:00]  makes me really  sad for the  people eating  it serves  you're right for  not washing  your mashed  potatoes before  you eat them  yeah how do  you who strains  them for boogers  imagine you're  about to put a  big heap  in your mouth  and there's just  a boogie  imagine you see  yourself with a  mirror with one  already in your  mouth and the  boogers hanging  out like a  fucking  like a fucking  cuervo worm  do you remember  the first time you  realized you could  do that though  when we  every time  every time we  talk about snot 
[00:44:30]  rockets it brings  me back to high  school bill madden  was the guy that  fucking snot  rocketed his ass  off it's so  fucking disgusting  it was amazing  to me though  he was on the  basketball team  with me and he  would run up the  court and just  fucking blow  snot rockets  as he was getting  back on defense  and I couldn't  believe you could  actually do that  and it worked  I gotta go down  with my fingernail  I gotta scrape  the cave wall  clean and then I  dine on it  we got another guy  Long Island seems to  be a hotbed of  activity for food 
[00:45:00]  abuse  what's up sir  hey is that me  yes sir  yes  all right  well I turned  around one night  I'm a baker  and I witnessed  for your father  for your father  Enzo  call me Enzo  and did you make  a cake  whoops  the groomed  the bride  whoops  I witnessed  one of my  co-workers  fucking a donut  go  oh my god  wow  I had the same  thing happen to me  when I played 
[00:45:30]  baseball  he fucked a donut  I wish it was a  cronut  and rolling  not a donut  the donut dough  oh the donut dough  because yeah  you're fucking  donut  you're going  right through  the thing  it's not as bad  as fucking the dough  he would fuck a donut dough  somebody put his dick  in the register  and then he set it up  and I had to leave  I had to leave  and go to the bar  next door  fascinating  why did you have to go 
[00:46:00]  to the bar next door  that was way better  than enjoying  the Jim Norton laugh  yeah  probably load up  on donuts  alright sir  thank you  let's go to Eddie  in Massachusetts  Eddie  hey how's it going  hi Ed  I used to work  at a deli  and we actually  had to let somebody  go because  the kid got caught  putting  you know like  you know when you  go to a deli  like a supermarket  there's the hot dogs  out in the case  instead of buying  the whole package  and buy them  singly  yeah  well  one Saturday morning  we had to let  this kid go  because some old lady 
[00:46:30]  after he had just  filled the case  asked for fresh ones  in the back  and because he was  pissed that he had  to take the extra  two seconds  to go back  and grab hot dogs  he threw the hot dogs  down his pants  and then gave them  to him  while the hot dogs  were down in his pants  and he was fishing  them out  someone from management  walked in on the  whole thing  so pretty much  let him go on the spot  I'd love to know  what his explanation  was in that moment  what did he panically  say  in a panic  what did he say  maybe 
[00:47:00]  you know what  maybe he like  admitted to  stealing them or something  because that's a little  bit better than  you know  tainted some old ladies  hot dogs  would be your own  hot dogs  yeah I hate people  that mess with food  man  something really sad  about that  alright thank you sir  have a great day guys  they should pay the  employees more  that's true  and they won't be  disgruntled  they won't be  fucking your food  let's say hi to  Abe in Colorado  hey but at least  you know he'll be  telling the truth  yeah I used to work  yeah I used to work  at a hotel  when I was in high school 
[00:47:30]  and my specialty  was fucking  the potato salad  specialty  what the fuck  is going on  it's a specialty  aunt  hey it's my specialty  I'm mud on  like muddy used to fuck  that makes him proud  that was his specialty  who else do you know  fucked the potato salad  that was me  we had macaroni salad  which you would think  would have been softer  but the potato salad  was like  did you ever fuck  one of those girls  that had like  a scratchy pussy  it was kind of  like that  yes  on a paper plate  at a picnic 
[00:48:00]  I did  but it was really  the owner's fault  he set me up  for bad hygiene  why did he say  was the potato salad  dressed seductively  yes  it was very hot  it was way too cute  it wasn't very kosher  it was asking for  on my very first  day of work  he gave me  a bottle of nail  polish remover  and had me  removing the  expiration dates  off the hot dog  packages  so I figured  I was in it  clear for other  weird shit 
[00:48:30]  wow they do that  he did  he was nasty  he used to cut up  but do hot dogs  ever expire  they seem like  they would last  forever anyway  yeah  maybe  I didn't need them  or the potato salad  alright  thanks man  that was great  appreciate it  you guys used to  work in a movie theater  what could possibly  go wrong  in a movie theater  he probably pissed  in the popcorn  buttered the popcorn  with jizz  with boogers  on the pretzel nuggets  oh my god  shark off move  he fucking put  squizzlers up his ass  like corkscrews 
[00:49:00]  pulled out shit  they went in red  and came out  fucking licorice flavor  some fucking audible  go ahead Ryan  what did you do  at the movie theater  hey guys  I didn't do anything  we had a guy there  but he was  he was like the champion  at destroying food  I would suggest  when you go to the theater  don't ever get popcorn  out of those  giant scoop bins  because those  as opposed to  the other ways  they serve popcorn  at the movie theater  you mean the one  where you step  on the clown's foot  and the popcorn  shoots out of his mouth  the one where they  fry up individual 
[00:49:30]  kernels  one at a time  you don't understand  man  we come from  another planet  we need this  explained to us  if you guys  can get popcorn  directly out of the  popper  like you know  sometimes  but you're not  explaining why  you don't  eat it from  the big fucking  popcorn thingy  we would have  guys that would  just spit in there  not rocket  one guy would  put his hands  down his pants  and reach in  and just grab  through the popcorn  those things  are just disgusting  a bunch of  assholes

[00:54:30]  to get to this week  as we highlight  all the great moments  from the Opie and Anthony show  we'll get to the Montreal stuff  in a minute  because I'll bring you everything  all the little clips  all the little highlights  you're going to love it  before that  Anthony Weiner was in the news  this week  Anthony Weiner is of course  the ex-congressman  who got thrown out of congress  or I guess he resigned  because he was tweeting  pictures of his dick  if you remember  that picture of his penis  that really did him in  was put out there  by who?  Opie and Anthony  on what show? 
[00:55:00]  the opiate  incorrect  it was on  after Opie and Anthony live  that's where the news happened  okay  get that right  in the history books  well  now Anthony Weiner  is back in the news  because he can't stop  texting out pictures  of his dick  we decided to reenact  some of the sexts  that he was sending  that's what the kids  call sexual text messages  some of the sexts  that he was sending  they got out there  they published transcripts  of them  on the internet  so we decided  to have Club Soda Kenny  and one of our hot interns  to reenact the text 
[00:55:30]  it's probably an HR nightmare  but it made for good radio  so here it is  on the worst of the week  countdown  number five  you can't have a mayor  that types  would you let me come  on those perfect kids  you just can't  and we're shock jocks  oh  we would  you know  yeah  the material we would get  from  mayor fucking danger  right  mayor Carlos danger  it's easy to take  the angle like  of course we want  a mayor that  talks like this 
[00:56:00]  but you just  can't have  you don't think  people would be  taken seriously  and work with him  good morning everybody  at least he picked  a realistic sounding name  Carlos danger  max power  Anthony Weiner  is Carlos danger  yep  he certainly is  my god  he had a second chance  what the fuck's wrong  with this guy  society gave him  a second chance  which is so rare  he'd have been okay  if  if  he had stopped 
[00:56:30]  and this was just  some shit from  right  you know  a year ago  two years ago  whatever it was  but  it turns out  that this is  new stuff  when this broke  once again  on twitter  yeah  before the mainstream  news there  I'm like  oh okay  they finally got  some more old shit  that popped up  yeah  and then I'm like  what  what  he did this  after he left  congress  what  and his wife  is standing  next to him 
[00:57:00]  at his press  conference yesterday  and she was  pregnant at the time  that he went  back in with  this shit  right  she's looking  up at him  he's fucking  trying to look  all contrite  as she's giving  her speech  about the fact  that she loves  him and believes  in  look man  yeah  I mean  I don't  I don't want  to be  part of a city  where the mayor  says things like  like  I must have  come thinking  about you  and looking  at you  100 times  how does that  make you feel 
[00:57:30]  gross  question mark  I said I was  hard  help me  I just don't  want a mayor  that says  things like that  and if you're  if you're  testing this stuff  you're not  done  right  you're not  done  he's probably  doing it  right now  by the way  anyone who  wonders what  sex addiction  is  this is it  he's addicted  right Jimmy  but this  people are like  it's not  addiction  this guy  blew his  political career  right  six months  later he 
[00:58:00]  still couldn't  stop  he couldn't  stop  he went  right back  in after  he left  congress  it looks  like  and then  he's trying  to say  that he  stopped  in November  no he  didn't  stop  there's no  way he  stopped  in November  people don't  stop  when they're  at this  extent  of  I really  want a  mayor that  says  standing  behind  you  lathering  with one  hand  fingering  you  with the  other  go up 
[00:58:30]  to  Albany  and get  some  funds  for the  city  please  you know  what  though  this is  he makes  a good  point  here  God  I want  to take  you  from behind  in front  of a  mirror  I want  to see  your face  and feel  your pussy  spasm  as you  come  with me  deep  in you  can you  imagine  Mayor  Bloomberg  or Mayor  Koch  or  I  got  to  take  you  from  behind  I 
[00:59:00]  want  to  see  your  face  and feel  your pussy  spasm  as you  come  with me  deep  in you  look  there's no  goody  two-shoes  in this  room  but  this is  just  this is  ridiculous  you just  can't  have  a mayor  that's  addicted  to sexting  it shows  a lack  of  judgment  is what  it is  and if  you want  to be a  politician  you can't  show these  lapses  in judgment  like this  who cares 
[00:59:30]  what he does  I mean  more power  to him  you want  to fucking  sext and  pictures  jack off  whatever  you're a  dude  but again  if you want  to be  a politician  you can't  you don't  have those  freedoms  anymore  to where  you can  do this  and leave  unscathed  and he  was shock  jock  on the  other hand  right  do this  all you  want  and he  just  doesn't  understand  how  the world  works  these  days  yeah  you know  you  oh  jimmy  oh  which  one  do you  like  i don't  like  this  one  you 
[01:00:00]  may  want  to  be  wet  he's  huge  for  you  today  he's  a hack  so i  guess  to bring  everyone  up to  speed  anthony  weiner  who  well we  were the  ones that  officially  sent the  picture  out there  ruined him  is the  word you're  looking for  i think  that was  two years  ago  right  two years  ago  yeah  well i  mean the  picture was  gonna get  out there  so yeah  i sleep  well at 
[01:00:30]  night  it was  just a  matter  of time  we  just  happened  to be  the  ones  yeah  that  went  went  for it  and then  he went  away  and then  he comes  back  and he's  doing pretty  good in the  polls as  far as  becoming the  next mayor  of new york  city  he's doing  all right  people are  accepting him  and accepting  you know  his past  is his  past  and then  this shit  hits yesterday  yeah  and the new  york times  and pretty  much every  paper is  basically saying  get the  fuck out  of the  race  you  creep  that's 
[01:01:00]  what they  want to  write on  the  cover  you  creep  meet  carlos  dangers  on the  front  page  of  one of  our  people  yes  he's  terrible  the worst  fucking name  he picked  the daily  news  enough of  all the  lies  and salacious  revelations  wiener's not  fit to lead  america's  premier city  beat it  beat it  get it 
[01:01:30]  it's a  jerk off  joke  he had  this one  this is  how dumb  this guy  is  he didn't  realize  he was  being  set up  he says  so you  won't tell  me what  picture of  me you  like the  most  or turns  you on  the most  only tv  and she  says  specifically  your health  care rants  were a huge  turn on  oh my god  he fell for  that  dummy  oh no  he fell for  that shit  oh my god  he should have  said like  what are you  talking about  right  so  there was a 
[01:02:00]  press conference  yesterday  should we play  the press conference  should we start  there maybe  a little bit  yeah i think  we should hear  some of this  all of a sudden  there was a  press conference  and then we got  all the uh  all the sexting  his wife  having to stand  there  it's like 10  pages  having to stand  there again  but the juicy  ones highlighted  oh yeah  six months  after he is  finished man  there's no way  you come back  for this right  no  man people  never believe  you again  they gave you  a chance  too man  holy fuck  behind closed doors  that wife  has got to be  you fucking idiot 
[01:02:30]  you had a chance  and you fucked  this up  and she's in politics  the wife's in politics  so the wife is like  okay i'm gonna  attach myself  to this  yeah  like it's not  just a marriage  it's also a career  move for her  now he's gone  and fucked  everything up  right  what kind of  politics does she do  she used to be  like an aide  for hillary clinton  oh right  like she was  like a real  she was like  a secretary  or something  i don't know  some kind of aide  did some fucking  filing for hillary  but she thought  she would have  a political career 
[01:03:00]  too  well some guys  got to be  inside the plane  these politicians  seem to be  which one is that  that's inside  the fucking  uh  san francisco  or la guardia  la guardia  la guardia  ah  yeah  that was a piece  of cake  i want to see  inside the plane  crash landed  in san francisco  politicians are creepy  yeah  i think they're  creepier than radio  people  yeah  it's the power  i really  i really believe  that  absolutely dude 
[01:03:30]  absolutely  there's a million  of these guys  yeah  power thing  power thing  everything  carlos danger  is a power thing  he does  carlos danger  humiliating  it is humiliating  why would you  fucking come up  with a name  like carlos danger  jesus  i can't even look  at him  god i would hit  that so hard 
[01:04:00]  your pussy  would beg  for mercy  murky  murky  well let's go  to the press conference  so breaking news  it says anthony wiener  news conference  on new sexting scandal  and like i said  i thought this was  like some old shit  that came up  oh no  but new  one no  here is live  anthony wiener  he's at the podium  give us a couple seconds  his wife's smiling  uh smiling  see how degraded  she feels 
[01:04:30]  that's actually bad  oh yeah  with a big smile  yes  the heads poking up  from the cubicle  behind him  are the funniest part  like what  um  i have said  that other text  and photos  were likely to come out  and today they have  as i've said in the past  these things that i did  were wrong  and hurtful  to my wife  and caused us  to go through  many challenges  in our marriage  that extended  past my resignation  from congress  while some of the 
[01:05:00]  things that have been  posted today  are true  and some are not  there is no question  that what i did  was wrong  this behavior  is behind me  i've apologized  to my wife  puma  and i'm grateful  that he has  she has worked  through these  pause what  what's going on  hold on  he's carlos  the jerko  oh my god  he loves jacking off  he's fucking 
[01:05:30]  finished  this guy is a complete joke  wow  why is he downplaying  in this news conference  like  he's leaving  but he's leaving  out the fact  that this new one  came after  he left congress  oh my god  he said  which went beyond  my resignation  so he  he tried to hint  at it right there  this is a year  after though  that's saying  i think so  yeah this was  last august  i think it was 
[01:06:00]  yeah  july  a year  yeah a year  yeah last july  maybe he thought  after he left congress  he had nothing to lose  he's like fuck it  so i just don't sex  all right  might as well  might as well  continue sexting  i have nothing to lose  i lost my gig  right it was one or the other  and he has nothing else to do  he's probably bored  and then all of a sudden  jerk off  to work  all of a sudden  he starts realizing  oh my god  i could actually make a comeback  oh shit  i did some things  well that stuff  probably won't come up  oh fuck  i hope they don't come up  your rant on healthcare 
[01:06:30]  got me wet  what an idiot this guy is  well you should have went  huh  what  right  but he's an egomaniac  he assumed that  you know people really enjoyed  his healthcare rants  whose pussy got wet  hearing him yell about  healthcare  oh  is it not a sexy subject  oh your cancer rant  made me cum  what  your healthcare rant  especially  she said  oh my god  he's thinking luckily  i used the name  carlos danger  so this won't come back  to me  yeah no one will know  yeah 
[01:07:00]  carlos danger  what the fuck  tied up all the loose ends  with that one  oh yeah  he's smarter than we are  carlos danger  carlos danger  carlos danger  he's an international man of mystery  that really is  danger  anyway  let's go back to the press conference  her forgiveness  i want to again say how very sorry i am to anyone who has received the receiving end of these messages 
[01:07:30]  and the disruption that this has caused  and my wife as i have said  my wife and i have said are  moving forward together  um... to some degree with  forty nine days left  until primary day  um... perhaps i'm surprised that more things didn't come out sooner  uh...  i'm responsible for this behavior that led us to be in this place  um... but in many ways things are not that much different than they were  yesterday  oh yes they are  this behavior that i did  was problematic 
[01:08:00]  to say the least  destructive  to say the most  caused many  stresses and strains in  my marriage  but i'm pleased and blessed that she has given me  a second chance  for the past several months i've been asking new yorkers  to also give me another chance  to show them that i had a vision for the middle class and those struggling to make it  and that i wanted to move  forward  um...  right into her vagina  it's perfectly reasonable  and then back  and then move forward again 
[01:08:30]  to be curious about it  and i'm going to be there and try to answer those questions as best i can  um... it is also  perfectly understandable that all of you are doing your job  being here in these great numbers  and i'm sure it's not just because of the  mayoral forum we're going to have in a few minutes  um... but all that being said let me just  stuck around for the mayoral forum  to my wife  how sorry i am that i  i did these things and  um... how sorry i am to  other people that got these messages for any 
[01:09:00]  inconvenience or  he's lying  of course he is  um... now some have asked the question where does this  fit in some  timeline some timeline of the continuum of  the  resignation  uh...  look the  the resignation was not a  point in time that was nearly as important to my wife and me as  the challenges in our marriage and the challenges of the things that i had done  oh my god  um... and working through them  um... some of these things happened before 
[01:09:30]  my resignation some of them happened  after  oh there it is  that was also the time that my wife and i were working through some things in our marriage  i'm glad these things are behind us  i know that  oh you're not  very public thing that we had happened to us  um... but by no means was to change the fundamentals  of my  my feelings here and that is  that  i like jerking off  i want to bring my vision to the people of the city of new york  i hope they're willing to still continue to give me a second chance and i hope they realize that in many ways what happened today was something that frankly had happened before but it doesn't represent all that much that is new and now i have a chance to do something i haven't had a chance to do 
[01:10:00]  um... fuck my wife  i can't know yet  puma as you know has been out there with me recently and she had a few words that she wanted to say so  um... my amazing wife puma abadine  amazing wife  amazing wife 
[01:10:30]  well she was amazing  yeah my lousy sexting wife  right  my wife who writes lol every time i write cock or fuck  right  my wife who's obviously a horrible lay  uh...  jesus  but you know what in a weird way this is what we get  the people like the apology  it's been proven to work  he should be humiliated to say this  oh my god  he should be in hiding  well this was early yesterday so i mean  yeah look at the papers he's humiliated  i think he's surprised it made the front page  he's hoping to get buried 
[01:11:00]  i didn't hear what umma had to say  what did umma  hi good evening  she's smiling  um  as many of you who  have followed this campaign know  guys  uh... i've spent a good deal out on the campaign trail  um...  at churches  and  street fairs  um...  she doesn't know what to say  um...  mention more things  yeah  so this is the first time i've spoken at a press conference  and um... 
[01:11:30]  you'll have to bury me because i'm very nervous  and i wrote down what i wanted to say  look at anthony when you're laughing  ha ha ha  i jerk off  when we faced this publicly two years ago  it was the beginning of a time in our marriage  that was very difficult  and it took us a very long time to get through it  our marriage  like many others  like many others  and it's stout  you know we all like  being with our husband that jerks off 
[01:12:00]  and a whole lot of therapy  to get to a place where i could forgive anthony  it was not an easy choice  in any way  but i made the decision  that it was worth staying in this marriage  i made the decision  that was a decision i made for me  for our son  your son  and for our family  i didn't know how it would work out 
[01:12:30]  but i did know that i wanted to give it a try  anthony's made some horrible mistakes  oh  ha ha  that's hurtful  but i do very strongly believe  that that is between us  in our marriage  well not anymore  in every paper  we discussed all of this before anthony decided he would run for mayor  so really what i want to say is 
[01:13:00]  i love him  i have forgiven him  i believe in him  and as we have said from the beginning  we are moving forward  thank you very much  thank you for your time  oh boy  i'll be glad  she is beautiful man  she's really fucking hot  yes  now what happens  does he take questions  yeah  oh yeah  no prank questions got through unfortunately  but  do they ask about this 
[01:13:30]  yeah  yeah  this would be the topic of conversation  well how would you best  relieve the traffic problems  in our fair city  mr danger  mr danger  mr danger  candidate danger  yes  oh god  candidate danger  yes  carlos  and he responds to it  candidate danger  yes  danger  carlos danger  danger  oh my god 
[01:14:00]  you picked that name  danger  this is so ridiculous  uh let's uh you want to hear him uh answer a few questions about it  i certainly do  okay  i have to take one or two questions  one or two  did your wife find out if there were messages after the resignation  oh  she knew all along  no she didn't  this process  as i was more and more honest with her  um  could you pause that  that is so telling 
[01:14:30]  he goes  she was aware of this all along  and then realized  no not all along  the process  and then  uh  bah  as  as  as  as  honest with her  no  as she dug up more shit  and you had to fucking fess up to it  as she continued to go  what the fuck is this  you don't become more and more honest  you become less and less deceptive  because you're caught  you know  a year in  a year after the scandal  she must have  are you still fucking doing this  yeah yeah exactly  are you fucking kidding me

[01:22:00]  highlighting all the  wonderful things  that happened this week  on the Opie and Anthony show  We only call it  Worst of the Week  because we like  a little bit of irony  in our best of  It makes it atypical  It was Montreal  Just for Laughs  Comedy Festival  this week  and we were there  We did two giant live shows  and they were jam-packed  with stuff  We had Joe DeRosa  in, we had John Mulaney  in, we had Colin Quinn  in, we'll get to all that  We'll highlight everything  that happened  while we were in Montreal  but what I want to start with  is Chris DiStefano 
[01:22:30]  You've probably heard him  if you listen to the After Show  which you should  because it's fantastic  He's been on  After Opie and Anthony  Live with me a few times  but Just for Laughs  was his moment to shine  as he made his way  to the big show  the Opie and Anthony show  for the very first time  and he did not disappoint  tales of his father  threatening people  tales of him  taking supplements  and that leading to him  hitting people with  baseball bats and chairs  You're going to want to hear it  He's a funny guy  and if you don't laugh 
[01:23:00]  he'll break furniture over you  It's Chris DiStefano  on the Worst of the Week Countdown  Number 4  This kid looks like  an ass kicker, right?  Chris?  Yeah, he looks like a problem  Yeah  It could be a problem  I think people think that  about me  but I don't get into  many fights, man  I always try to talk it out  but like I said yesterday  there was a couple of times  one time in my life 
[01:23:30]  I really snapped  but that was about it  The baseball bat time  Baseball bat to the back of the head  That was the only thing  that I did  But it wasn't  and it's  It was a racial incident  Exactly  With some slurs thrown  Yeah  What was he doing?  Waiting for a bus  in Howard Beach  in Ontario  You're in the wrong neighborhood, guy  How many times has he said that?  Yeah, guy  You know, it's a bad thing  What's up, guy?  All right, calm down  No, it's fucking  We were playing basketball 
[01:24:00]  and a kid fouled me  and I fucking just went home  and got a baseball bat  I happened to have a bat on me  at the basketball game  Yeah, yeah, yeah  No, he went home  and got the bat  which is worse  All right, you're a psycho  Plenty of time to think about it  You had plenty of time  to calm down  but you still went back  with the baseball bat  and gave him a shot  It was a time in my life  where I was really like  exercising a lot  and I was taking this thing  called NO Explodes  Which just fucking  makes you  lose your mind  I almost had like  three heart attacks  when I was 19 from it  I just 
[01:24:30]  this kid fouled me  and I just  fucking went nuts  Yeah  And I fucking lost it  and my mother was like  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  And I was like  this fucking kid fouled me, mom  Wow  I want pancakes  How long was the walk home?  It was about a five minute walk  Holy shit  Plenty of time to cool off  Yeah, no  I fucking  my heart  I honestly had to go to the hospital twice  taking that shit  Wow  And the doctor was like  you gotta stop  I was like  but I gotta get fucking ripped  So I'd rather have my heart explode 
[01:25:00]  Yeah  Did he apologize  after he fouled you?  Or after he got hit with the bat?  Well, no  it was a whole big  it was a whole big thing  His father  was gonna press charges on me  and then my father  paid his father a visit  and was like  you know  I don't know what happened  Get me an envelope full of money  Yeah  No charges were ever pressed  You know  What did your father say?  You think  I don't know  I have no idea  what my dad said  he would handle situations like that  and never tell me  Hey, we could work to sell like gentlemen 
[01:25:30]  Yeah  The problem always went away though  Kids  you know  kids  they lose their heads  tempest  What are you gonna do?  Yeah  What can we do?  That's all you do  What are you gonna do?  And then everything's cool  There actually is another situation  where I snapped  Oh shit  I'm sorry  It's fine  Honestly  it's just all coming back  You were on a date  and she said no  Yes  But  this is a situation  that I think  most of the guys would snap  So  and this is one time 
[01:26:00]  where I did see my father  it happened in front of me  So  9-11 happened  right  my mother worked in the building  she was okay  but  she worked on like  the fucking 95th floor  Holy shit  I didn't speak to her  I didn't know  where she was  you know whatever  I went to all boy  Catholic high school  I start just  fucking  I lose my emotions  I start hysterical crying  just going crazy  this kid Frank  starts laughing at me  Uh oh  So I took  and I honestly  I took a chair  and I broke it over his head  Wow  Like over his shoulder though 
[01:26:30]  And uh  you know  that was a big issue  Yeah sure  Yeah the guy's cool  And um  so they  they were going to  throw me out of school  they were going to  expel me  from school  Until it was all  put in perspective  of 9-11  Yeah  You know  Well  so I call my dad  right away  and I'm like  Dad I'm going to get  thrown out of school  He goes  No  you're not  nothing's going to happen  don't worry about it  So  we get off  we had off the next day  off Wednesday  We go back Thursday  I go back to school Thursday  I just tried to show up 
[01:27:00]  like Larry David  when he said he got fired  Yeah  And then he just showed up  like that's what happened  I just showed up  and they were like  DeStefano  you're expelled  I just called my dad again  I said  Dad they're going to  throw me out  and he goes  I'm going to be there  in 10 minutes  I was like  you live on Staten Island  we're in Queens  he goes  I'll fucking be there  in 10 minutes  Wow  He shows up  in like 12 minutes  with New York Yankees  batting practice jacket  a coffee  you know  and flip flops  and he goes  I need a meeting  with the principal  I need to sit down  with the principal  Listen  Brother Alphonse  we got to talk about this  Well  and he says 
[01:27:30]  and they're like  well you can't just  get a meeting  you know  and he goes  just give me a meeting  with the principal  so we go  we sit down  with the principal  and I swear  this is all true  I'm not making any of this up  the principal says  he's expelled  and my dad said  there's got to be  another situation  there's got to be  another  we have to figure  something out  the kid thought  his mother was dead  he was getting laughed at  come on  wouldn't you do  what he did  and the brother was like  well no  I'm a man of faith  you know  and he said to my dad  aren't you a man of faith  and my dad  was very specific  he goes  I lost my faith  September 6, 1979  and he was in prison 
[01:28:00]  at the time  so I think  something might have happened  oh no  oh no  that I wouldn't want to ask  and then he just  looked at me  and I was like  alright  head down  there's a date  he remembers  yeah I was like  sorry dad  and then he really goes  and then he really does  he says  the key says  to my dad  what part don't you understand  Mrs. Stefano  your kid is thrown out  and then my dad  takes like a deep breath  he got fucking  beyond pissed  I think this is  number one 
[01:28:30]  he just revealed the fact  to his son  that he got fucked  and he has some jail  in some weird way  and you know  number two  he fucking  you know  my dad type of guy  like at that time  he just didn't say  that type of stuff  so he says  brother  brother  brother Roy  what's his name  brother Roy  I'm gonna give you  two choices right now  he says  the second one's  really gonna suck  for you  he goes  choice number one  we work something  out right now  choice number two 
[01:29:00]  and he said  I again  this is gonna suck  I'm gonna come over  that table  and break both  the kneecaps  and then he says  I know you're gonna  think that I just  heard that from a movie  I'm the guy  they write the movies  about  so I was like  holy shit  and then he stands up  in front of the door  waiting for the answer  waiting for the answer  and says  I'll call 9-1-1  right now  he says  I'd rather  go to prison  for the next 15 years  than have my kid  get thrown out  and have to listen  to his mother's 
[01:29:30]  fucking mouth  he said  so  you make the choice  make the right one  white is a ghost  and he says  well what do you  want to do  and I was on the  basketball team  at the time  and my father  was like  well let's just  expel him  from the basketball  team  I was like  fuck that dad  break his kneecaps  I want to play ball  and that's what  wound up happening  and then actually  they became friends  somehow  by the time  graduation  but I got  expelled from  the basketball team  who became friends  my dad 
[01:30:00]  and the brother  and the principal  became friends  after that  that was like  the second time  I snapped  that I just remembered  and then I almost  got thrown out  of school for it  but instead  I just lost  a basketball scholarship  oh wow  man  yeah  and then my dad  revealed this specific thing  yeah  and then I started  wanting to become a comic  after that  I felt the pain  I was like  oh shit  couldn't go into  the family business  what high school was this?  Archbishop Malloy  oh  and you started for them  yeah  well I was  I know that 
[01:30:30]  Queens basketball  my brother played  for Ford  so I don't want  to hear his scholarship  no insult  but you don't seem  quite tall enough  for a basketball  well I was  you know  like 40 pounds lighter  and just fucking  like  ripped  yeah  I was ripped  and I was just like  very  plus it was hard  to stop scoring  because if you fouled him  he'd go home  and get the back  right  so there were no chairs  you drive the lanes  you can do that  now my team was good  though  we were top 10  in the country  yeah Malloy  yeah we were fucking 
[01:31:00]  you gotta rep  everyone sitting on  beanbag chairs  yeah  a couple of kids  go to the NBA  so it was fucking  pretty  yeah on one team  which is  not white though  no no chance  no no white  the baseball  kid Mike Baxter  he played for the Mets  white guy  we were in the same  he saw that whole shit  go down  yeah  yeah  fucking  holy shit  he saw the whole shit  and I  tell him to give you  free Mets tickets  or the same will happen to him  yeah  that's it  throw that weight around  yeah  the worst  is yet to come  more of the Opie and Anthony

[01:36:00]  comedy festival  so he stopped by  the morning after  he talked about his speech  he was talking about  but more hilariously  he was talking about  some of the  more foolish moves  that he's made  in this show business career  of his turning down roles  rewriting scripts  when is Colin Quinn  not good on the show?  just listen to it  number three 
[01:36:30]  Colin Quinn everyone  look E-Rock didn't want  to come out during that  Colin Quinn  sit down Colin  take a seat  call  good morning  wonderful  good morning guys  hi Kyle  how are you sir  thank god you mentioned me  yes  your awful staff  just had me sitting  back there for like  20 minutes  surrounded by fucking  Tim Hortons  that you people  are supposed to get  that you're not  going to get  apparently  Jimmy bought donuts  yesterday Colin  what?  he bought donuts  for the crowd  yesterday  what a sport 
[01:37:00]  it was a real moment  bonding with the crowd  I knew a guy  that he got thrown  against the plate  glass window  by Tim Horton  the Tim Horton  he punched  Tim Horton's father  and then Tim Horton  came over  and beat the shit  that little bit  of trivia  I love that  little bit  of trivia  it's the unknown  Larry Gretzky  Wayne was famous  oh boy  Colin  we gotta say  the keynote  was great  thanks 
[01:37:30]  I loved it  did you work  hard on it  did you toil  I did  but I got  very little done  you know  I feel like  the other guys  doing the keynote  came in from LA  so they had all  those eight hours  on the plane  right  I unfortunately  was on the plane  with you guys  and sitting next  to Amy  and a certain  gentleman  blowing gas  how terrible  was Jimmy  on that fucking  plane  it was awful  it was brutal  it was delightful  the flight attendant  hated our guts  you think she noticed  yes 
[01:38:00]  everyone noticed  and I don't know  why we answer  his questions  because he loves  this  it was so ugly  he gets so  he's so happy  Amy almost threw up  I know  if I would have  got Amy Schumer  to fucking vomit  on herself  in the plane  I would have  just got back  on a plane  and come right  home  mission accomplished  nothing tops  that  the farts are brutal  holy fuck  so yeah  the speech  was really good  it was  it was  it was  it was  what is  it's like the keynote  it's just about comedy  or is it more  two comics 
[01:38:30]  or is it about  the festival  because you spoke  a lot about  about you know  comics and what  we should be doing  right  and what the business  is not doing  right  it was great  I don't know  I just saw  they did it  the past couple of years  they didn't really  tell me what the hell  you just figured  you'd do it  you know  I figured I'd really  do what you want to do  yeah  you mentioned  some direction  fuck them  you mentioned  something in your keynote  I wish you would have  expanded on it  what part were you up for  in Austin Powers  I was up for the sun  in Austin Powers  oh  I know 
[01:39:00]  I seem a little  long in the tooth  for it  I really stopped  them on that one  they're like  oh  no because that was  interesting during your speech  you were talking about  how Mike Myers  called you  you had this part  but you were working  on your stuff  I was working on my stuff  it was a combination  of arrogance and fear  and it was like  oh no  I just kept talking  and it was hard to believe  and so then  I just was like  yeah man  I'm doing my own  my own movie  and I had this script  I was writing  but his movie  was like a go movie 
[01:39:30]  like a big  I mean it was  there was nothing  about it  I gave like  eight reasons  why I didn't want to do it  and he gave me  eight reasons  why that was cleared  and it was no problem  yeah but you didn't want  to go in and audition  I understand that  no I didn't have to audition  he gave me the part  oh my god  he gave him the part  now  dude  based on the part  the only thing I had done  I wasn't like some actor  but he was like  he was like  yeah I saw you do this  Larry Sanders thing  just do that  what you did there  just do that  and why  why didn't you  I think I was  I think it was a combination 
[01:40:00]  I was scared  I had this whole idea  in my head  I was going to get  my movies made  that never happened  yeah I found that  interesting  we talked about that  yesterday  yes it was arrogant  terribly arrogant  but not as arrogant  I mean that was  a little bit of fear  I'll say the  Crocodile Dundee thing  is a lot more arrogant  oh writing  10 years before  rewriting the script  rewriting one line  one line in the script  reading the script  just being like  this is not New York man  and then rewriting it  I mean I was like  the worst screenwriter  of all time at the time  my poor girlfriend 
[01:40:30]  had to type it up  and then I go  she's probably thinking  why am I dating this ass  you know she's not  going to be in the business  but she's like  oh what am I doing  oh and you actually  turned it in  to somebody  but they say  I think it's important  to remember  they say if you act  like you know  like a success like that  you'll be successful  oh boy  in these cases  it didn't work for me  no  unlike Tom Popper  parading around  in his multicolored shirts  you notice that  everyone's noticing  Tom Popper's dressing  no I just heard you guys  when I walked in 
[01:41:00]  oh okay  I said it's 7.05  and these bastards  are crashing  poor Tom  he's probably on here  for 3 hours yesterday  doing his best  that is a shitty thing  to do  oh we love him though  I don't like the  pomposity of Tom's outfits  no it's true  that's how we show love  we love the guy  he's a fool  but in all fairness  you know  no one knew  the Austin Powers movies  were going to be  as huge as  they became  no it really does kill me  when I think about  those 3  those 3 in a row  at what point did you  like when you did that 
[01:41:30]  how far into it  did you realize  like oh fuck  like how long  was the movie out  before you were like  oh boy  no like years  years later  I was like  fuck it man  I didn't give a shit  I was like  I'm going to get mine done  once I couldn't get  any of my  because if I had done  those movies  I probably could have  got my things done  that's how it works  you have to be in  those things  and then you know  they're like okay  now we'll do your thing  yeah yeah yeah  but I made Seth Green's  career I mean  that's got to be worth  something  oh man  wow  yeah  that was a  really good story  yesterday  thanks 
[01:42:00]  oh that's  you know  magic  I knew the story  but I didn't know  the fear was the  surprising  right  yeah exactly  well I didn't want  to admit my  gutless spinelessness  if you're going to  give the keynote speech  I have to be honest  I like that you  opened up Colin  I really enjoyed that  so  oh boy  were you nervous  giving the speech  no only at the  beginning when stupid  Todd Barry  I thought I didn't  know  Todd Glass  Todd Glass  when uh  yeah  when he said  yelled out  fuck Andy  I was like  fuck you 
[01:42:30]  I didn't know  who it was  and I was just  furious  some idiot  heckling  oh that was  Todd Glass  don't heckle  a keynote speech  but he wasn't  heckling Colin  to fuck him up  he was like  trying to agree  with Colin  like yeah  I know  he was trying  to do a  I don't know  he explained it  to me last night  he was very stoned  no I was doing  like the guy  that doesn't get  the point  and I was like  right  but except I  didn't know  it was you  was he mad  was that  was he mad  I was mad  I know  but I'm also  asking if he was  I don't give a shit 
[01:43:00]  I know  what would he be mad  about  he'd be apologizing  you handled it perfectly  he'd be on bended knee  you were fine  why are you yelling at me  I was just wondering  if he was mad  well I don't understand  why you would even  give him the leeway  to allow him to be mad  he has no right  but I'm not saying  he would have been  right to be mad  I'm just saying  sometimes people  act irrational  well but couldn't  you have said  well you know  although it would have  been wrong  was he mad  I didn't need to  preface it with that  we all knew it was wrong  are we ever going to  go to strip clubs  I hope so  let's go tonight  I think tonight  we decided  did you guys have  like a midnight show  tonight  tonight was sex night 
[01:43:30]  or something  surprise show  I like a good  7pm strip club  I like a nice  post dinner strip club  where it's still  light outside  where it's still  light outside  you're with the  early customers  yeah one of the  early customers  you get the girls  when they first come in  they're fresh  they're in a good mood  they're fresh  they're day strippers  we've talked about it  you walk in during the day  and your eyes haven't adjusted  you're just banging into things  you can't tell where the seats are  and then when you leave  and it's still light out  it's even more tragic  you're too shitty about yourself 
[01:44:00]  you're looking at the sun  like you're a vampire  right  yeah  I've never done that  I like to be headed home  by 7.45pm  I think that's  early to bed  early to rise  45 minutes in the strip club  for a nice dinner  yeah you have a little dinner  buffet  I used to know a girl  who worked in a strip  what the hell was it called  in Port Washington  Port Washington  of course  on Long Island  it was run by these  terrorizing bikers  I didn't even know  they were a bikers  on Long Island  at that time  pagans  the pagans  run all the strip clubs 
[01:44:30]  don't touch the girls  they used to it  back in the day  yeah  absolutely  how bad was the place  it wasn't that bad  oh it wasn't bad  but I was like  I didn't know at the time  that these guys ran the club  and I'm like talking  as if I'm in charge  once again  I think the pattern  in my life  is delusions of grandeur  in every situation  and this guy  just comes up  this big guy  in like a denim jacket  it was like 1978  and just grabs my arm  I'm like what the fuck  you know meanwhile  he's like twice my size  he could have fucking  destroyed me  and she goes  he's in the pagans  oh  why did he grab you 
[01:45:00]  because I was like  yapping off to her  or something  oh  yeah you're probably  mouthing off to the girls  don't talk to them  let them do their work  what did you not want  to pay for a dance  no I was  I was  I was  I was  I was  I was  I was  but you know  only comedians  have to yap  every two seconds  you have to yap  in all situations  I used to love  those Long Island  strip clubs though  they tried turning  everything into  a gentleman's club  right  you used to have  to go to the city  and sit there  and that was  the $20 lap dances  and shit like that  but on Long Island  it was all about 
[01:45:30]  down and dirty  a couple of dollars  in your pocket  you could give a girl  a buck  she'll fucking writhe  in front of you  for a while  and then move on  to the next guy  no it was like that  in the city too  it was like that  until like 19  the gentleman's club  came because of  your people  the Italian mob  the bikers are like  hey man  just bring out  the girls  see some dudes  but then these  gavons get involved  and they're like  a gentleman  people enjoy  because they enjoy  being a gentleman  Italians  you know  they're like  the suit  they're gonna get  the massage 
[01:46:00]  this is  we're gonna open  a classy church  like their whole thing  is to try to be  like Walsh  like they wanted  to assimilate  the way they are  Irish actually did  where they'll be  like the new wasps  but they just  couldn't pull it off  so instead  they're like  the outer things  like yes  I have a suit  they have a couple  of guys on Wall Street  beating balls  off a broker  and then  they'll give out  envelopes for everything  like this is an envelope  here's an envelope  that fixes everything  an envelope full of cash 
[01:46:30]  full of ill-gotten gains  yeah  here you go  hey I appreciate  what you did for me  an envelope full of  ill-gotten gains  yes yes  and then they decided  to fuck the whole  strip club thing up  yes  by making  gentleman club  that's correct  and uh  you gotta go in there  and you know  all you want is  to see some  fucking girl  shaking her ass  in front of you  for some expensive  overpriced beer  five star meals  yeah yeah  you have to dress  properly 
[01:47:00]  no hats  what  what the fuck  is that about  you have to buy  or you want to buy  the lady a drink  right  no  fuck her  let her be thirsty  right  how about  I want to buy  the lady some cum  right  let her be the  whore she is  yeah  exactly  oh sorry  a lady's drink  was expensive  that was a little  too harsh  yeah the lady's drink  jesus sorry  and it was  it was very  you could get away  with not even  giving the girl  any money  in the strip clubs  because you'd have  the bar  you'd have everybody  sitting at the bar  and the girl  would be dancing 
[01:47:30]  like two feet  away from you  because she's  dancing in front  of the guy  sitting on the next  bar stool  and there's no wall  up  so you just look  and go yeah  and then she'd cut  to you  you put your head  down  she moves along  right  and you get to  see some you know  some shit  now they put up  walls and all  sorts of shit  you want to go  in the back  for  no  no  you want to go  yeah  we have the  diamond room  the diamond room  used to be the  fucking bathroom  in this shithole  right  what you're talking  about  but it's a good  psychological thing  because they go 
[01:48:00]  you want to go  in the back  and every guy  doesn't matter  what kind of  misery you are  you're like  once she gets  back there  she'll end up  wanting to do  something with  a guy like me  she's gonna dig  me  I'm a gentleman  it's the worst  when you go in  and you see  there's a couch  with a bunch  of other people  like a private  it's not the  ultimate private  room  it's a bunch  of people  and I'm like  fuck  I can't come  like this  nothing's gonna happen  here  yeah  I would always  try to sneak  one in  during the lap dance  like if the ass  cheats are on my  dick  and it's going  back and forth  evenly  I'm like  I might be able  to blow a load 
[01:48:30]  and I have a couple  of times  I've won  a couple of times  yeah  it's the greatest  feeling  I love that  you're trying  to sneak one in  I love that  and I love the  audio  what the hell's  going on out there  I'm trying to  that's his penis head  no no  that's the motion  of her  it kind of is  actually  her ass cheeks  over the dick  right that's what  I mean  it's moving over  your penis head  it's a very  very steady motion  you need a folia  worker here  to fucking  make the sounds  yeah  but then you know  one time 
[01:49:00]  a fire broke out  radio the way  it's meant to be  yes  Kyle what did you  do last night  anything else  yeah I had to go  do my show  and then I had to go  to a gala  and then I had to  go do  holy shit  did you do  Big J's  it was a full night  well how do you  like this  one minute  I'm doing my show  the lovely  unconstitutional  I'm feeling so good  oh yeah  then I go over  to Big Gala  Eddie Harrison  it's like  how many thousands  of people  I gotta go do that  right after that  I have to rush off  to the titty district 
[01:49:30]  and do Big J's show  I go on  I come in  he's on stage  in jorts  like a  true general  but he is  jorts  yes  he's wearing jorts  and he's like  and it's like a  it's like a crowd work  I spent the whole time  trashing him  because it's a  crowd work show  you're not allowed  to do the material  you just work the crowd  he opens up  working the crowd  all the people  up front  by the time I got  hey  and he's like  you know  he really is generous  he leaves a lot for you  hey what do you do  why don't you go  suck 40 guys off 
[01:50:00]  honey  look at this guy  go blow him  it was nothing left  by the time I got there  I'm like thanks Jay  oh wow  oh you just  destroyed the whole  except to trash Jay  which of course  there was plenty of that  left  you're doing unconstitutional  every night up here  yeah  that's pretty good  I hope these people  these locals  go and see Colin Quinn's  one man show  it's amazing  it really is  thanks  is it odd though  that it's a whole  different country  what's that  it's a different country  so unconstitutional  it's like hey  here's how things  worked in our country  right right 
[01:50:30]  it's a little strange  you gotta change it up  a little bit right  no you can't really  change it but  wear a powdered wig  or something  powdered wig  talk about the  Magna Carta  whatever that is  I really am a  crushing bore  I'm only getting  more boring  as I get older too  I like to do a show  about electronics  I bet you'd like  to do that Anthony  I love a good  electronics show  wouldn't that be good  I can see the headlines  Colin's show is shocking  you working on  another show  no  that's your thing  now 
[01:51:00]  you gotta work on  more one man shows  no man  you're done  that's it  two and done  and you know  who came in last night  just to show  the kind of clout  I have in this society  Lawrence Fishburne  wow  came in  then we're walking  over to the gala  together  I'm walking  to the gala  people are supposed  to see like  hey Mr. Quinn  like hi Mr.  and they're like  shoving me aside  on the show  nobody cares  fucking Morpheus  man  of course  that's pretty  do you know him  or did he decide  to come see you  yeah no  he grew up  around the corner  from me  oh so you know 
[01:51:30]  really  I know him  since he's like  nine  no way  come on  so you knew  when he was  in Apocalypse  now  I actually  we were talking  about that  last night  I was on the bus  he had moved  but we were  on the bus  when like  you know  just a city bus  and he's yellow  you know  and he starts  telling me  yeah I'm in this movie  with Marlon Brando  and I was sitting  on the bus  going yeah  Lawrence Fishburne  cracked up  he lost his mind  oh really  I thought he was crazy  but he really did  actually ladies and gentlemen  Colin Quinn was off  at the part  of Charlie Sheen  yes and Robert Kelly  was off at the part 
[01:52:00]  of Colonel Kurtz  so yeah  the speech was really good  it was  it was  it was  it was  what is  it's like the keynote  it's just about comedy  or is it more two comics  or is it about the festival  because you spoke a lot  about you know  comics and what we  should be doing right  and what the business  is not doing right  I don't know  I just said they did  the past couple of years  they don't really tell me  what the hell it was about  you know  you just figured  you'd do it  you know  I figured I'd really  do what you want to do  yeah  you mentioned  some direction  fuck them  you mentioned something  in your keynote  and I wish you would 
[01:52:30]  have expanded on it  what part were you up  for in Austin Powers  I was up for the sun  in Austin Powers  oh  I know  I seem a little  long in the tooth  for it  I really stopped  them on that one  no because that was  interesting during your  speech you were talking  about how Mike Myers  called you  he had this part  but you were working  on your stuff  I was working on my  stuff it was a  combination of arrogance  and fear and it was  like oh no  I just kept talking  and it was hard to 
[01:53:00]  believe  and so then  I just was like  yeah man I'm doing  my own movie  you know I had this  script I was writing  but his movie was  like a go movie  like a big  I mean it was  there was nothing  about I gave like  eight reasons why  I didn't want to do it  and he gave me  eight reasons why  that was cleared  and it was no problem  yeah but you didn't  want to go in an  audition I understand  that  no I didn't have to  audition he gave  him the part  oh my god  he gave him the part  no  dude  based on the part  the only thing I  had done I wasn't 
[01:53:30]  like some actor  but he's like  he's like yeah  so you do this  Larry Sanders thing  just do that  what you did there  just do that  and why  why didn't you  I think I was  I think it was a  combination  I was scared  I had this whole  idea in my head  I was going to get  my movies made  that never happened  yeah I found that  interesting  we were talking  about that yesterday  yes it was arrogant  terribly arrogant  but not as arrogant  I mean that was a  little bit of fear  I'll say the  Crocodile Dundee thing  is a lot more  arrogant  oh writing  10 years before  rewriting the script  rewriting one line 
[01:54:00]  one line in the script  reading the script  just being like  this is not New York  man  and then rewriting it  I mean I was like  the worst screenwriter  of all time at the time  my poor girlfriend  had to type it up  and then I go  she's probably thinking  why am I dating  this ass  you know she's  been in the business  but she's like  oh what am I doing  oh and you actually  turned it in  to somebody  but they say  I think it's important  to remember  they say if you act  like you know  like a success like that  you'll be successful  oh boy  in these cases

Hey, retarded David Tell.  Hi, sir.  Hey, what's up?  Not much, man.  How you doing?  Are you a fan or do you work for this place?  Sirius XM.  I'm on Canada Last, a Canadian Sirius XM. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, you're an employee.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, you do a show?  Yeah, I do a show, man.  What kind of show?  Comic Stripped.  It's a talk show, comics.  I did it.  It's good.  We're doing right here.  Yeah, I think Bobby's doing it later, I think.  I'm doing it later, I mean.  Oh, cool.  I wasn't invited to do it, but.  Yeah, you were.  You said no.  No, I wasn't.  Yeah, you did.  Oh.  Did you invite Jimmy?  Hey, Jimmy, want to come do my show, man?  No.  Bobby's way nicer.  Oh, man.  Trying to divide and conquer everybody. 
[02:10:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I can't stop looking at the two fucking Chinese dudes.  Can we put the Arabs and the Chinese dudes together?  What?  And then have Troy and this fucking mush sit together?  Just pair everybody up?  Yeah, just pair them all up.  And then what?  People come.  I don't know.  Just look at them.  Like a zoo.  Jesus.  Holy shit, this show's over.  It's a transitional phase.  We'll go back to the interview portion. 
[02:11:00]  We'll chat with John.  We were professionals.  You guys are fucking pros.  We're just trying to bounce around.  John, let me ask you a question.  What's up?  You work for SNL.  I used to, yeah.  Oh, you quit?  Well, last year, yeah.  Yes, I do.  No one ever leaves, so yes.  What do you mean by that?  I don't understand.  Everyone comes back.  Really?  Watch the show.  Everyone comes back.  You've never been in a skit, have you?  No, I did stuff on Update.  Like I weaseled my way onto Update to do like desk pieces.  But you were one of the head writers, right?  I was a writer for four years. 
[02:11:30]  I never had a head writer.  Oh, really?  Was it as bad?  I mean, people talk.  I know you can't trash it because you're still there kind of, but was it as crazy as people say?  It was as crazy, but it wasn't as bad because when I got the job in like 2008, I had read  all those books about SNL.  How bad it was, right?  Oh, this is going to be like Jay Moore's book and, you know, the Live in New York.  I was like, this is going to be like cold, shitty, unfriendly, but it's worth it to do  for a year.  And then it was great when I got there.  Like Seth Meyers and those guys really made an atmosphere where it's a lot nicer. 
[02:12:00]  I think from you, you hear from people, it used to be that.  It used to be a lot more cutthroat.  And I think just people have gotten over that.  But as a writer, you don't have to worry about getting like the skit that you want to be  on camera for.  Like the guys that are actually on camera, they submit ideas and it's like, oh, they  didn't take my fucking idea.  Being a writer, it's just kind of like, you know.  Yeah, they're vulnerable in a different way.  Yeah.  So like it's going to be, you're going to take it a lot more personally.  So there's no backstabbing going on with you.  Yeah, if you write a sketch about like the Grimace and it gets cut, that's fine. 
[02:12:30]  But if you're fucking dressed as Grimace waiting backstage.  And then they tell you, it's off.  And then they go, hey, that's off.  You're going to be a little pissed.  That's a lot more humiliating.  Guys, he's sitting right here.  Come on.  When Kurt hosted, we had a whole thing.  How do they pay over there?  Pretty good?  Yeah.  Make a good dime.  Get yourself a long apartment.  Yeah, I got like a studio apartment out of it.  That was good.  That was nice.  Did you live in a studio? 
[02:13:00]  No, I moved after that even.  But I got out of the fucking Greenpoint hellhole I was in.  So that was good.  Are you married?  No, I'm getting married.  I just got engaged.  Whoa.  What the fuck are you thinking?  Look how nice these guys.  If we're in the US, they'd be like, boo.  Boo.  Fuck that noise.  Prenup?  Uh, no.  Oh, God, you asshole.  No.  Prenup.  Anthony's had an unpleasant experience. 
[02:13:30]  Jesus Christ.  You got a prenup.  How do you bring a prenup to a woman?  I'll tell her.  I'll tell her what happens.  It's terrible.  That is a good question.  How do you do it?  Because everyone says that, like, get a prenup.  But for real, how would you fucking bring that up?  You just bring it to her while she's sleeping  and just scribble a name on a piece of paper.  So she doesn't need it to be sleeping to forge a signature.  You could just do it when she's not in the room.  You like the fact that she's unconscious in front of you? 
[02:14:00]  Yes.  That's better for sex.  That's what they're banking on, though.  The fact that you're getting into, at the beginning,  it's all the love and nicety,  and there's no way we're going to be together forever.  We're not breaking up ever, ever, ever.  And then you sign this, what amounts to a horrid contract,  where you could lose your shit.  And then when it ends, it's just as bad as any other bad thing.  You're not thinking about the love.  You're like, I should have gotten a prenup.  Oh, dude.  All right, I'll call her.  Yeah, do that.  Hey, I got some good advice this morning. 
[02:14:30]  I set up a PowerPoint presentation with celebrities that, you know,  here they are getting married, and now here they are.  Like, just fucking miserable.  She's not going to be swayed by examples of women getting a shitload of money out of their house.  You can't be like, hey, look what happened to Johnny Carson.  He had to give away $150 million.  Yeah, and look at her better second husband.  Yeah.  Look at her total happy fucking second act in life.  Yeah, look how miserable she is with these millions and this new guy with a bigger dick. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, don't do that.  I'm not dealing with a comedian anymore.  All right?  Not a good strategy.  Yeah, how do you bring that to a woman?  That's a fucking great question.  I would just leave it.  Before it gets to marriage, you talk about that, right?  You're like, I would get a prenup if I ever got married.  You've got to put the, yeah, plant the...  That's true.  Early in a relationship, you can say a lot of things.  Like, I only have one kid, and if we have a second one, we're killing it.  You can say all those things early, and then later be like, now, as we discussed months ago.  Yeah, yeah, you can't then bring it up again. 
[02:15:30]  Can't fact-track now.  No, no.  Where's she going to go?  You're John Mulaney.  Where's she going to go?  That's pretty good.  Thank you.  I'm the Mulaney over here.  That's nice of you to say.  I bet she's very attractive.  She's beautiful.  She's a beautiful lady.  And, you know, she'll get sick of me, and it'll end badly, but that's okay.  So what?  That's all right.  How long have you been with her?  Three and a half years.  See, John has come a long way in three and a half years career-wise, too.  So it's like you knew her before you started doing really well.  So it's like it's harder to bring that to her now.  Yeah, I've known her for a long time. 
[02:16:00]  She was just, yeah.  Oh, which means, by the way, she was instrumental in your career.  Oh, you mean for, you're back to, yeah.  You're back to the courtroom?  The lawyer's going to love the fact that you, your career got better once you got together.  Is that a real thing they use?  It happened to him.  My wife, whose only occupation, as far as I know, was drinking Jack Daniels, was instrumental in me getting a gig on radio.  I married her when I was a construction worker. 
[02:16:30]  I was installing heating and air conditioning duct work.  That's when I met her and married her.  I then got into radio, did pretty well for myself.  And apparently in court, I was told that she is most of the reason that I did well.  Wow.  Did she take the air conditioning money, too?  Oh, yes.  The millions you earned in heating that.  The lucrative air conditioning fortune.  Oh, it was terrible.  I think you really helped her Jack Daniels career along also. 
[02:17:00]  I think I did, too.  I gave her as much as a man could buy.  I told my wife, when she did a sign of a prenup, she'd be like, for what?  What am I going to guess?  See, you never know.  They're like, oh, I'm signing a prenup for my fucking 20 bucks I'm able to spend a week.  Is that what you were able to spend a week when you were banging nails?  Maybe, yeah.  Are you shitting me?  Well, I had to pay credit card bills because they gave me an $8,000 credit limit Visa card,  and I bought a jet ski on it.  No wonder.  No wonder why you're.  Oh, that bitch. 
[02:17:30]  That's why you don't have any money.  Yeah, that bitch took all my money anyway.  I'm going to go buy a few jet skis.  Just fucking white trash.  Oh, totally.  Please.  I need it.  It's only for an emergency, and I feel the emergency for personal water crap.  I would love to see you if you never got the show where you'd be now.  It would be awesome.  Oh, my God.  It would be so bad.  You'd fall asleep on somebody's fucking roof at noon.  I would.  Yeah.  He'd be wearing shorts and fucking work boots. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  You'd have Daisy Dukes.  I was.  Right now, you'd be yelling, Ma, we got any bologna left or what?  Oh, God.  I had to move back home.  Three failed marriages.  After one, I knew that was it.  I'll never get married again.  I got an idea.  I know how you can drop the prenup thing in.  Just leave it.  Get a PDF of it.  Just leave it open on the computer screen.  That's good.  And then when she goes to use the computer, she could be like, John, what is this? 
[02:18:30]  What's going on?  Because we have a shared home computer.  Yes.  We have a big PC we both use.  Wasn't that your engagement present?  Yeah, yeah.  I got her a 1993 Dell, and we both use it.  No, that's a good...  Yeah, I should leave it around in all the places she likes to look.  Or I'll just put something in my wallet if she ever goes through it that says, hi, I wish  we had a prenup.  No, what you ought to do is this.  Use your psychology.  You bring it up to her and go, look, I mean, I feel like you're doing really well.  Oh.  And if things were to not work out, I would wind up getting more than I was supposed to, 
[02:19:00]  and I would like us to have a prenuptial just so we both kind of...  That would be so worth it to do just for me to do the acting performance of trying to  be like, hey, I've been thinking about something.  You know, it's for your benefit.  Why don't you see if the Chinese guys can put in a fortune cookie?  Wow.  Wow.  This is crazy.  Hey, why don't you sign a prenup?  Your winning numbers are six, nine, four. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Your winning numbers are 30 million in 50 years.  How could you be so mean to them when they've been worshipping you for so long?  Woo!  Woo!  That was...  That was very, very fast.  You know what?  I don't know who's going to top that one.  That was a buildup right there.  Wow, that was a good one.  Holy shit.  That is good. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, I don't know how you would approach it, really.  I'm sorry.  Does she make any money at all?  I hope it works.  Yeah, she makes money.  He's the only one on the couch that you guys are worried about him getting a prenup.  The rest of us...  Fucking yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  You can tell he's going places.  You didn't get one, no Bobby, right?  DeRosa is going to have to give him a velvet painting and a couple books.  He has some shitty tattoos.  And every one of those books is called cheat.  Because it didn't sell?  God damn, motherfucker.  I thought that that was a fucking gem. 
[02:20:30]  What?  They don't know the book.  Oh, that's right.  Me?  They got to know the book.  It didn't sell.  It's a paradox joke.  That's a paradox joke.  You put yourself in a situation.  The book sold.  The book sold.  It did well, Bobby.  It did well.  It did okay.  If fucking Billy Bird had become famous in the middle of it, it would have done better.  Yeah, that always hurts a book sale when a guy gets famous.  That's what killed John Grisham was getting notoriety.  You're missing the points.  What did you ask me, John?  I don't remember now. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, shit.  This fucking guy's back.  You're like an elf.  He is.  Like a little scarf?  Yeah.  He has like an Arafat scarf, like he's going to fucking take war photos in Syria.  How many pictures do you need of six out-of-shape dudes on a couch?  Six out-of-shape dudes.  What about De Stefano and Mulaney looks like a late stage of AIDS, but still thin?  I feel like I look early AIDS.  You do.  1981.  I don't know.  I haven't yet. 
[02:21:30]  I'm sort of like, yeah, I've had a cough lately.  I don't know what it is.  John, you have a, uh...  Like the guy that Jenny dates in Forrest Gump, which is like, I've got this new thing.  And they're like, groovy.  Looking like that is how he got the guy to fuck him in the first place.  John's got an Anthony Perkins Circa Psycho 3.  Oh, man.  I don't know what's going on right now.  That was wordy.  I'll tell you what bothered everybody.  You said Circa, and we hated you for it.  That's exactly where it was.  The Worst of the Week countdown continues. 
[02:22:00]  We've reached the top.  This is the Worst of the Week countdown.  My name is Sam Roberts, and most importantly, we've found the number one bit of the week.  It's what we do.  We highlight all the greatest moments.  If you've missed any of this countdown, I think they might put it up on demand.  I don't know for sure.  They should.  But if they don't, it also replays all weekend, so you can hear at least parts of it.  You should listen to the show every morning anyway, so you should have already heard this stuff.  This is all just catch-up work.  The number one bit happened in Montreal at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival, 
[02:22:30]  where we were broadcasting live earlier this week.  Joe DeRosa came in, a room full of comics.  Bob Kelly was there.  Jesse Joyce was there.  Chris DiStefano was there.  All these guys.  And, of course, a bunch of other people.  All these guys are in there.  And instead of trying to combat being in the barrel, Joe DeRosa sits down on the couch and decides to announce to everybody that he wants to suck a dick.  He thought it was a good idea.  I can't say I agree with him, but it was nice for all of us listening, wasn't it? 
[02:23:00]  It's Joe DeRosa, and believe it or not, he's in the barrel again on the Worst of the Week countdown.  Number one.  Can I tell that story that you were telling me about getting your baby pictures?  When we were on the phone the other day, where you got the baby pictures done?  I guess you can now, Joe.  Do you think these assholes are going to let it go? 
[02:23:30]  They have nothing to talk about.  They just brought up my podcast for the first time ever.  When's your podcast?  Tell us.  Talk to us.  Don't tell if it's you're embarrassed, Bobby.  No, no.  Yeah.  If you don't want me to tell it, I won't tell it.  Shut up.  Tell it.  I'm kidding.  Tell it.  Oh, my God.  You think I meant that?  I can't tell.  Dude, tell the story, Joe.  I called the other day.  I go, what are you doing?  He goes, dude, I'm going upstate.  And I go, we're going to go do this, this.  And I go, okay, cool.  And he goes, then we're going to Bailey J's house to take pictures with the baby. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, no.  Wow.  And I go, can you give this kid a fighting fucking chance to not be the piece of shit  that we are?  And he goes, he's not going to be in the pictures, asshole.  Her husband's going to take him.  Even so.  Well, he's a good photographer and he's cheap.  I'll explain to my kid later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who was there?  Who was holding the flag?  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Give me that one picture of you with your head under the dress like you're taking a picture  in 1910.  Riley likes that one, too.  It's an open household.  My kid pissed on Matt's foot in the photo.  Yeah, he's used to that.  Ah, fuck.  Christ, I'm just throwing out stinkers today.  No, that wasn't bad.  But that was a fucking, that was a Jake LaMotta comeback.  You're used to that.  No, no.  I meant because of Bobby.  I meant because his wife's got a dick. 
[02:25:00]  I got it.  I got it, Jacob.  Oh, okay.  We all got it.  All right.  This wasn't funny.  No, what I said, you're used to that was actually what LaMotta said in Raging Bull.  Oh, he did?  He blamed us for being stupid.  Yeah.  Not his jokes, stinking.  I didn't.  I played myself.  I said, I've been throwing out stinkers all day.  That's what I said.  Oh, Joe.  Wow, Joe.  Have a little confidence in yourself.  Bailey J looks, I mean, honest to God, though, unbelievable.  Oh, sure.  Oh, she looks.  I mean, me and my wife, Dawn came up, too. 
[02:25:30]  We were hanging out with them.  They have a beautiful home in a cul-de-sac next to a pagan witch and some other hippie.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you can't just move back to regular people.  You can't just move back to a regular family.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to go.  Yeah, Bailey posted a few pictures recently.  And it was like, whoa, okay.  Oh, my gosh.  It's so confusing.  I'm no longer confused about it.  Oh, you're not?  I really?  Suck her dick and lick her asshole. 
[02:26:00]  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  What?  What do you mean what?  Travis, I'm sorry.  It's fine, Joe.  I'm sorry.  Travis, what are you apologizing him for?  He did the same thing.  Oh, it's fine.  Between Travis, not so much Travis, but with Lisa in the house.  Host, what the fuck was I just doing?  I don't know, but you see how easy.  It's not a Canadian.  Lisa in the house.  It went from home to house, and it connected.  It's Canadian.  Yeah, usually that's Jimmy assimilating.  What's assimilating?  No one knows what that word means, but what are you going to do? 
[02:26:30]  You're simulating.  Say it in an English accent.  Go to the gym.  Go to the gym.  Eating batter.  I lost a little weight.  I got injured sleeping.  I hurt my hand in the goddamn pillow.  Sometimes you hurt yourself.  I was biting the pillow.  Yeah, I've got fingerprints in my hips like they're dull.  I loved that me scratching my colonia turned into me getting banged in the ass by some dude in Montreal. 
[02:27:00]  You wouldn't fess up to exactly how it happened, so we must speculate that you were getting dicked in the ass.  So, Joe, back to what you just said and how important it really is.  You would suck Bailey J's dick.  Well, remember about a year ago, I was on the fence about whether I'd suck her dick or not.  I am far past.  I am off of that fence.  Wow.  That fence post is firmly planted in my ass.  You didn't need to be on the fence.  I unlocked the gate and walked through it for you.  Joe, what changed? 
[02:27:30]  I just think she's so fucking hot that the idea of putting her dick in my mouth turns me on.  Wow.  Joe, you're gay.  You're just gay.  Well, hold on now, Bob.  I don't want to...  And that's amazing.  Canada really changes people.  It all seems okay up here.  Yeah, everybody's so nice.  Very liberal.  Very liberal-thinking people.  It was just for laughs.  Tom watched Liberace get his balls tickled in the bathtub for a month, and he's creeped out by Joe. 
[02:28:00]  That was wordy.  I didn't think he was going to make it.  He got it.  He was slid.  He pulled it out.  He did.  Joe, you don't think that's gay, Joe?  No, not at all.  Because I don't want to blow any of the fine-looking gentlemen in this room.  Wait a minute.  I'm going to slow down.  No, no, no.  I'm not insulting them.  I'm kidding.  I can't tell anymore.  I don't know why.  Maybe you were going to throw your coffee on me last week because I thought you were being serious,  and you're like, I'll throw my fucking coffee on me.  Yeah, throw it on your back so you're used to it. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Like, fucking cum.  Jesus.  Hold the coffee, just the cream.  So, wow.  So, you're thinking of it this way.  It's just a woman with a penis.  Yes.  That's right.  It's just an extension of her.  Yes.  It's a long, hard vagina.  Yes.  You know what Joe's going to really realize he fucked up is when just that load hits his mouth,  and he's going to go like this. 
[02:29:00]  I'm fucked up.  I'm fucked up.  I need a barrel.  I need a barrel.  Yes.  It's going to be like when you get a bad bite of a tuna fish sandwich, and you just go,  oh, oh, oh, oh.  I'm fucked up.  He's going to run home in the woods.  It doesn't taste like a girl.  It doesn't taste like a girl.  What was I thinking?  I'll tell you when you realize you're fucked up.  It's when the aftertaste hits you. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, God.  Of the sperm or the penis?  Oh.  The sperm.  Oh.  I didn't know.  I was just wondering if there's an aftertaste to a penis, too.  No.  I know.  Jimmy.  I'm Bobby.  I was.  I know.  Oh, boy.  I wonder what that's like.  What is the aftertaste?  Bleach.  Seriously?  Yeah.  My ex-girlfriend, I used to come in her mouth, and she'd come blow it in my face and go,  to my breast milk, I'd come, hey, did your ex-girlfriend have a cock?  Stop. 
[02:30:00]  Stop acting like you had to come inside somebody else's mouth, and they spit it back in your  mouth.  No, no.  It came directly from the fountain.  No, no.  Later on, Jim cut out the middle man.  I'm not denying that, but I'm just saying that where I get the aftertaste thought from  was from a girl blowing the breath in my face.  Right.  Travis's kid was just marched out of the room.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, but.  Smirly thrown out of the room.  This is the funny part.  The grandfather stayed.  We're still all in.  No, I like where this is going. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, God.  You're enjoying the show, sir?  Not much.  Grandpa, you all right?  We had to get the kid out of here, though?  No, no.  She had to go to the con.  To the con.  That's it.  She actually turned to Lisa and said, Mommy, I got to take a shit.  That's what she's learned over the years.  Anthony, you've never tasted your own jizz?  No, you know what?  Yeah, I guess I've...  Wow, this is a fucking solid answer. 
[02:31:00]  No, well, yeah, I have, actually.  No, because I was going to say no, because you just think of, like...  You come and then fucking shove it in your mouth.  Not like that, but I have...  You can't have a cum in your mouth.  I have cum in a girl.  Because your dick is so big.  You cum on a spoon.  I have cum in a girl.  Yeah, see, I use a spoon.  I'm civilized.  I have cum in a girl and then...  Jesus.  ...and then, like, kind of gone down on her.  Yeah, who has that?  Later on in the evening.  Really?  You know.  Not like shoving my tongue in there to...  What about...  Like a fucking...  When you get the edges of an ice cream sandwich. 
[02:31:30]  You know.  I was...  I...  Yeah, just the outside, but it still tastes a little.  As soon as you said...  That's the best answer.  I'm going to ask...  Well, we know.  Obi.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Why are you getting nervous?  What?  Obi's all of a sudden testifying in front of Congress.  He turns to his lawyer.  Should I answer this? 
[02:32:00]  Covers the mic a little.  Yeah?  Sure.  Give it a little taste.  A little taste.  A little taste.  Why not?  Anything to spice up that oatmeal in the morning.  Exactly.  Bobby has to turn the whole show gay when he comes on.  Bobby.  It's not gay.  I'm just asking if you ate the, you know.  I'm just asking if you ate cum after we talked to Joe about sucking a man's dick.  Nothing gay there.  She's not a man.  Absolutely.  Good point, Joseph.  All right.  You're a white knight over here defending her. 
[02:32:30]  That's right.  That's right.  She's my baby.  I know.  You need to fucking talk about her with respect.  I know.  Here's how you know Joe's gay.  Joe, if she didn't have the penis, would you still like her?  Nope.  That's not gay, Bobby.  Joe accepts her as she is.  That is something.  If she was just a girl, exactly the same as she is now, except she was really hot.  Of course I would still like her.  She was retardedly hot.  But would you be obsessing about her like this?  That's a good question.  No. 
[02:33:00]  There is something unique about her.  Cock balls.  Very unique to a girl.  There's, there's, well that's what I, I'm infatuated with her because I, a tranny, it's not my thing.  It's never really been my thing.  You're really selling that angle.  It's just not, you know, it's, I can't, I can't explain it.  There is something more intriguing about her, the fact that she is a transsexual.  But of course, if she was just a regular girl, I, of course, I'd want to.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Or just a girl. 
[02:33:30]  Right.  What do you mean?  No, seriously, I didn't understand.  What do you mean?  It was bad.  I'm going to be a real, I'm going to be a real man and blow her husband, Matt.  I'm a fucking man, Matt.  That's a real man.  Get a man off, but not gay.  I don't need those tits.  Fuck it.  It's the guy.  The obsession is because she has a dick.  Joe.  It's, it's a very intriguing thing to me.  Which is really, uh.  Joe says intriguing. 
[02:34:00]  One more time, I'm going to hit him with this.  Hold on, man.  Joe, you know, I had a friend who accidentally hooked up with a transvestite at Patty McGee's  on Long Island, like five summers ago.  Yeah, a friend.  And, uh, and, um, and then he fucking fell in love with this transvestite, and he wasn't  gay.  Whoa.  That's God.  That's God.  Wow.  And he's dead now.  Oh, Jimmy, that's my God.  That guy leaned up against the lights.  And, yeah, awkward.  And he started hooking up with this transvestite. 
[02:34:30]  He hooked up with this transvestite.  Hold on, Chris, Chris, were there breasts or no?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  No, the, the, the guy, he thought it was a girl.  We all thought it was a girl.  His breast is transsexual.  Transsexual, I apologize.  Big difference, trust me.  Transsexual, yeah.  In price, I mean.  And it was pretty, uh, yeah, sorry.  And, uh, and he felt, he was like in love with her.  It was just like his girlfriend.  And then he, he broke up with her.  And then he's, now he's like, has like a wife.  Wow.  Like a regular woman wife.  Does she know?  What?  Does she know?  Yeah, it's like out in the open.  She knows that he did that. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, everybody knows.  He just, it was just accepted like he's, I guess.  You know what I mean?  He, he, he, he had, he just, the girl had a dick.  It wasn't like chopped off, made a vagina.  It was a penis.  Oh, is that chopped off?  Yeah.  Well, I think, I think it went through the change.  Oh, okay.  So it was, uh.  Yeah.  British, yeah.  Post-op.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah.  So she couldn't have stuck his dick.  So he had, he had a little, uh, change purse?  We always wanted him, he wouldn't, because he was like in love with her, so he wouldn't  send us pictures.  No, but the, Trent, did he have a little, like a little pocket?  I don't know.  No, he stole the cock, he's saying. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  He had the cock.  He went to Thailand, yeah.  No, he said he didn't have the cock.  Oh.  The cock is made into the bedroom.  He's so confused.  Let me explain something.  Yeah.  This is what your friend told you.  She was pre-op.  She was not post-op.  Because if he was post-op, she would, he would show you, hey, at least you look like a pussy.  Yeah.  There was still a cock.  Oh, I love her too much to show you that beautiful pussy.  I would never dishonor her.  Yeah, you keep your quarters for the laundromat and her fucking snatch.  Oh, and Bobby, you know what, too? 
[02:36:00]  This guy, true, he scratched his cornea, got infected, and he does have a fake eye, so  you should make sure that you get antibiotics.  How do you go to that?  Absolutely.  I love you, man.  I was kidding about your head.  I love you.  No, I'm just, you know me, I care about your, you know, the health and all that.  But I also know you're nuts.  You take one thing and you just worry about it.  Yeah.  But he's just telling you to be careful, or all you're going to be doing is fucking playing  Peter Pan and doing Wheat Thins commercials.  Yeah.  Sandy Duncan, you young cocksuckers.  Wow.  Yeah, you people should remember old commercials from 30 years ago. 
[02:36:30]  Who the fuck's going to get a Sandy Duncan reference?  I apparently don't.  Yeah, I don't see that as being our fault.  It was a Higgins from Magnum P.I.  Joe, you dick kids.  Tag to your lacy, you bags of shit.  Have you seen how good the post-op vaginas look?  Holy shit, Joe.  You are all in.  Just because I follow a couple transsexuals on Twitter, and I look at their pictures constantly. 
[02:37:00]  I've seen a couple of pictures of those things.  I guess as more time goes on, they get better at doing that.  I can't believe it's not butter.  They take the penis.  They take the penis.  They pretty much just hollow it out, and then they flip it inside out.  Yeah, like a dishwashing glove.  Right, like a dishwashing glove.  The real test is, do they smell like balls still?  Oh, God.  It would have to, right?  It would have to. 
[02:37:30]  It's not going to smell like a woman.  I have fucked a post-op, and I suspect it was a post-op, because it was like the features that looked like duck lip.  I just had a really weird instinct, and I went to see a woman, and as we're fucking, I could feel that it wasn't normal.  It felt like different or something foreign about it, because I don't think it was as wet as it should have been.  And I just, I never asked, but I left, and I went, that was a fucking post-op transsexual, because I could just sense, my instincts told me there was something not.  I heard that it actually can get wet, though.  Oh, maybe.  No, the post-op. 
[02:38:00]  What the fuck is that?  I swear.  I found a picture of a post-op.  Bobby, you want to see this one?  I got some great ones.  Bobby.  Well, yeah, let me see.  You know what?  First of all, Opie's trying to make me puke, but it's too far away.  It looks like a salad.  It looks like a salad.  That should make you puke.  I love community crowds.  They're actually nice.  Yeah, they are.  Savage, mean fans back in the States.  It's true.  They actually went, aw.  I fucking love them all. 
[02:38:30]  I had a buddy that did that.  They didn't even realize it was transsexual at first, and the vagina was just, like, unusable.  Unusable.  Your asshole does a lot of the work.  You get that fake pussy.  It's a two-hole operation.  Yes.  Your asshole does all the heavy lifting.  You said her asshole looked like the hole in the wall they pulled Carol Ann out of and  pulled the great shit.  What's so funny, too, about, like, Arab chicks, like, and I'm half Arab, they won't fuck in  the vagina, because that means they lost their virginity, but they'll let you take them in 
[02:39:00]  the asshole.  Oh, that's good.  So that's, like, really romantic on your wedding night.  It's like, honey, I can't get my dick into your airtight vagina.  Can I just take a shot at your gaping asshole?  That's Joe DeRosa, by the way, for all the Arabs listening up here.  Joe DeRosa.  I'm half Arab.  Yeah, that's not good enough.  It's twice as bad.  I think that's worse.  I think that's actually worse.  You've been doing that now?  Yeah, you should know better.  Allah, what, what?  Allah, what?  Lock your fucking head off.  you don't think they stopped listening at the dick sucking part earlier you think they're still

[02:53:30]  like a week ago  and now it's  people are buying  old buildings  it seems  and they're finally  building it up  yeah  Detroit's like that  too  I don't know  if Detroit's ever  going to come back  yeah I was going to  say I don't know  what the situation  with Detroit is  but I don't think  the average American  realizes much  first of all  myself included  but like Cleveland  Detroit  like all these towns  like along the Great Lakes  and along the St. Lawrence  River that comes in  from the Atlantic Ocean  that was the entire  heart of the 
[02:54:00]  like steel  like anything  I learned this past week  Buffalo was the first  electric city  they had electricity  like it used to be  called the city of lights  can you believe that  like what happened  so I guess  there was this dam  I just learned this stuff  Tom Lewis  the guy who films  my tours of city  told me all this shit  of course I forgot it  when I did the tour  but there was  Lake Erie Dam  so it created  all these jobs  and then up St. Lawrence  they made another one  and that took all the jobs away  and then the rest of it 
[02:54:30]  is like the Rust Belt  but I don't do  I'm one of those guys  I still love doing the road  and I like going to  all those  those so called  run down cities  I like them  I like the people there  well those are the best crowds  like Cleveland  comes out to party  they're great  and I like the old shit  I like the old buildings  and I look at them  and I go  I wish I had the money  to buy that building  and just shine it up  I'm telling you  good place to invest money  downtown Cleveland  I'm calling it  the flats  what about the flats  let's call the date  I don't know about the flats  too many young kids 
[02:55:00]  kids down the flats  yeah no money in booze  no no no  I'm talking about  you want to be  you want a nice quiet place  after a hard day  of podcasting Jay  you want a place  where you can lay your head  on the pillow  oh Christ honey  I worked an hour today  I'm exhausted  my triceps are killing me  you don't need to listen  to the sound of puke  hitting the fucking brick pavement  the original brick pavement  that Tom Sawyer put in  or whatever  City of Blinding Lights  was actually  the U2 song  was written about Buffalo  I think  City of Lights  was Buffalo  for real  I didn't know  I used to play this  what the hell was it called 
[02:55:30]  this supper club out there  and it used to be  an old bootleg place  and downstairs  they had the tunnels  the guy's going to kill me  I don't remember the name of it  the Stardome  and  what city  Stardome's in Alabama  that's in Alabama  what city are you talking about  in Buffalo  okay  and  downstairs  they had the  bricked up tunnels  where they used to  run through the tunnels  when the cops came  I don't know how small  people were back then  I was just picturing  Al Capone  little midget him  waddling through there  because it was really  you know  it couldn't have been  more than like  three and a half feet high 
[02:56:00]  everything is smaller  and it's weird  because now  like if you go back home  to where you grew up  your street looks so small  your backyard  you're like  how the fuck  did I play back here  it's like five by nine  when you were a kid  it was your whole world  I know we were small  but also then  everyone actually  was smaller  true  there is that  but that thing  where people go  dude when I was a kid  you had snow  up to your waist  it's like  yeah  you were like  you were like  a year and a half old  dude  bro we made tunnels  yeah  exactly  and it's just  you also weighed 
[02:56:30]  40 pounds  two scoops of snow  would cover you  have you ever noticed  if you look at  older people's  like the older  brothers and sisters  if you look at  their yearbooks  everyone looks old  and if you look  at yearbooks now  you're looking at  like children  children  yeah  it's the  like our parents  yearbooks  I'm looking at  like a graduating  class  everybody's 40  yeah  they looked like  that too  everybody looked  like they were 26  when they were  in high school  there was just  something about  it was just 
[02:57:00]  I don't know  harder living back then  but they just  looked like  and when I was  like 18  I looked at a guy  who was 26  and I'm like  that guy  is a man  that guy knows  knows everything  and now me  I just turned 45  I don't know  shit  I really don't  I'm an idiot  I really am  it always bothers me  in the newspaper  like when an 18 year old  gets popped  and they go  well the 18 year old  man was apprehended  I'm like  don't call him a man  he's an idiot  yeah  it's ridiculous  certain things  well I mean  there's things  that you know  that you shouldn't do  by that age  but like

[03:04:30]  I did  a bunch  of them  yeah  you  couldn't  say no  it was  just like  you were  flying to  the middle  of nowhere  and after  all the  money  was  all the  travels  out of  your  pocket  so they  give you  like this  big number  like  don't you  want to  go there  and do  an hour  for 1200  bucks  you're  like wow  1200  bucks  but after  all the  bullshit  taxes  paying  everybody  planes  and all  that  you  probably  made  450  bucks  you  have  to  pick  up  Don  Gavin  on  the  way  there  and  you  know  it's  all day  to get  there  and then  driving  and all  that  stuff  so if  they 
[03:05:00]  got  you  a  nooner  gig  for those  who aren't  in stand-up  was basically  you had  the nighttime  gig  the nooner  was basically  you do a  stand-up show  at 12 noon  during lunch  at a  fucking college  in a cafeteria  or in a  hallway  or whatever  godforsaken  place  they put a  fucking  microphone  in  every time  I did  one  I would  always  drive away  going  I'm never  doing that  again  that was  absolutely  fucking  humiliating  you know  have a little  bit of  standards  I would  literally  be yelling  at myself  for having  such low  self-esteem  that I  took it  again  and then 
[03:05:30]  every  fucking  time  and I  would call  my agent  and I  would go  don't even  fucking  offer me  another one  and he  knew  he knew  I needed  the money  I'm sleeping  on a futon  well into  my 30s  so he knew  so he would  just call me  up  he'd be like  Billy  I can't say  his name  and he would  be like  so and so  calling  I have a  school  now they  don't have  a lot of  money  but I can  build around  it  it's in  Aberdeen  South Dakota  can you do  it  give me a  cow back

[03:17:00]  how about  tomorrow  I'm leaving  for New York  City  Saturday  morning  gone  for 10  days  I can  do your  show  when I  get  back  after June  2nd  is that  cool  I wrote  of course  June 14th  I heard  you on  Burt's  podcast  and then  I wrote  judging  by hearing  you on  other  podcasts  I gather  you're  back  in  town  here's  the thing  I did  one other  podcast  yeah  Tuesday  at 7  that was  a little  cunty  it was  a little  like  it was  a little  like  well  then  what  you  responded  I  pictured  you  like  if  you  still  had  your  mullet  like  you  sort  of  like  tousled  the  back  of  it  after 
[03:17:30]  you  said  it  like  you  wrote  back  I'm  back  in  town  sweetie  are  we  still  taping  at  7  yeah  that's  what  I  did  what  I  was  thinking  of  writing  you  back  was  don't  fucking  text  me  like  I  owe  you  money  you  came  at  me  like  I  don't  work  for you  if  you  feel  like  it's  it's  country  then  obviously  it's  country  no  no  no  this  is  what  I'm  saying  you  were  coming  at  me  like  there  was  some  sort  of  contractual  obligation  well  I  don't  want  it  to  come  across  that  way  because  you  being  on  the  podcast  is  a  favor  as 
[03:18:00]  you  well  you  don't  have  guests  in  your  podcast  you  know  I  look  William  Frederick  Burr  your  dad  was  a  dentist  and  you  actually  worked  in  his  office  as  a  kid  I 
[03:18:30]  found  that  interesting  when I  read  it  that's  a  weird  job  for  a  kid  like  I  can't  imagine  you  ever  thought  hey  one  day  this  will  all  be  mine  I'll  have  my  hands  in  other  people's  mouths  no  actually  that's  not  the  way  it  went  down  I  got  fired  from  a  no  I  got  let  go  they  fucking  laid  me  off  because  I  asked  for  more  money  your  dad  no  this  is  how  I  ended  up  working  in  the  dental  office  I  was  working  in  a  warehouse  and  it  was  this  fat  fuck  manager  and  whenever  he  walked  out  in  the  warehouse  all  these  douchebags  would  start  acting  like  they  were  working  and  I 
[03:19:00]  was  just  like  fuck  this  guy  like  all  of a  sudden  I  maybe  I  toned  it  down  way  too  much  but  then  when  it  came  time  for  a  raise  I  asked  for  a  raise  and  all  he  thought  of  me  was  this  is  the  asshole  this  is  the  only  guy  I  see  people  would  go  into  a  frenzy  wax  off  freaking  the  out  when  this  guy  would  come  out  because  he  was 
[03:19:30]  a  dick  but  he  wasn't  a  tough  guy  he  was  soft  but  he  if  he  could  have  did  he  send  country  texts  FYI  I'm  coming  out  there  in  three  minutes  he  would  do  that  that's  exactly  what  the  fuck  he  would  have  done  FYI  the  big  swinging 
[03:20:00]  dicks  coming  out  he  got  off  on  it  stuttering  they  were  fucking  nervous  what  was  the  factory  for  what  did  it  make  it  was  office  office  supplies  this  is  before  amazon  and  shit  when  you  actually  needed  a  bunch  of  satellite  warehouses  to get  the paper  nearer  to people  I don't  know how  the fuck  it worked  I was  always  I loved  warehousing  I highly  recommend it  if you 
[03:20:30]  have  issues  with  authority  if you  don't  want to  be in  any  designated  area  warehousing  is  great  where's  Bill  he's  down  the  back  you  know  you  on  the  forklift  nobody  knows  where  you  are  sales  sales  is  another  great  one  landscaping  is  good  driving  around  yeah  landscaping  is a  good  one  they have  to leave  you  alone  yeah  they can  leave you  alone  and you  can  there's  also  you can  really  kind of  break  your  boss's  balls  a lot  but when  you're  given a  task  they  actually  have  to  stop  talking  to  you  you  cannot 
[03:21:00]  edge  your  driveway  but  landscaping  that's  back  breaking  work  though  nice  hand  work on  a nice  base  get that  base  going  you  look  good  and people  go  how does  he do  it  you  go  I  don't  know  and you  got a  hand  like a  god damn  kung fu  grip  from holding  a weed  whacker  all day  nails  are green  yeah  I had  the green  nails  and red  skin  lady  FYI  big  swinging 
[03:21:30]  you'll see  the tip  first  I'll be  behind it  yeah  like  warning  I just  didn't like  his vibe  so I  asked for  a raise  after all  of that  and I  got  they  let me  they laid  me off  on the  spot  no  within like  a week  or something  I still  remember that  guy too  and he's  one of those  guys  this is the only  thing I'll give him  credit for  when he got  he was getting  fatter and he  would buy  bigger pants  he didn't  push them  down  and he had  these big  I will give him 
[03:22:00]  credit for that  he had these  big gray  slacks  and they  and they  were just  like  I know  I just wanted  to measure  just the  side of  like how  big they  were  and I  loved that  he was  getting  fat  and you  could tell  there was  no help  this guy  was not  gonna  he wasn't  gonna  he's probably  dead  I don't know  if anyone's  ever made  that  like people  always talk  about  observational  like what 
[03:22:30]  is the  deal  with people  when they  get fat  they put  the pants  under the  stomach  people do  that  I never  heard it  that's the  first time  I've ever  heard that  conversation  you still  have your  32 inch waist  from high school  like your pubes  are coming out  of the top  of your jeans  the ones I'm wearing  right now  these fucking  corduroy's are  killing me  I'm getting  choked out  by my own  pants right now  I'm not kidding  look at this shit  oh that's the  greatest thing  about the grunge  is that  the untucked  shirt  I think it's  finally starting  to go back 
[03:23:00]  to tucking  your shirt in  but like  you can really  get away  with murder  with a button  down shirt  but did he  wear a belt  how did he  keep those  up around  the big  front porch  I think he  did but his  stomach was  keeping him  up  you could take  his fucking  belt like a  hula hoop  you could just  move it around  if you wanted  to  he was  anticipating  there wasn't  the diets  the P90X's  there just  wasn't  it was like  Jane Fonda  workouts  cheese  and one of 
[03:23:30]  those shake  machines  where you  stand on it  and vibrate  it was just  all go lift  weights  so then you  had the guys  who were getting  fat and continued  to lift weights  so they had  like this  rock'em sock'em  upper body  right to the  belly  and then the  belly would  just come  just fucking  hurling out  it's a hard  belly bill  it's hard  that's hustle  on that  oh yeah  rather than  calcified fat  was what we  later learned  and you know  when you get  to that fat  where you got  those creases  on the side  like Bruce Lee  gave you  like a double  chop  I have them 
[03:24:00]  yeah  you gotta get  rid of those  man  I'm working  on it  but I'm not  really working  on it  no it's all  it's all  food man  yeah I ate  a lot of pizza  you know what  how do you not  how do you not  it's just  everything that  makes you fat  is so fucking  delicious  and I've actually  tried to get  my head  in front of  fat at all  you're thin  you're thin  still  and you're  older than  me  I got a  zip up  on  there buddy  let's not  kid each  other  I can grab  a nice  fucking  handful 
[03:24:30]  there  alright  but still  I got a  way bigger  boiler than  you  I got a  front porch  here  yeah but  you got a  good base  though man  you have the  landscaping  background  we both came  up in the 80s  so we still  have a little  bit of that  maybe I can  make the  football team  yeah a lot  of incline  sets of four  don't worry  about it  shoulder presses  pyramid  what's your  max  get the  max out  knuckle breakers  dude  nose breakers  nose breakers  remember that  when you try  just two sets  of one  just max out  today we'll do  the pyramid  max out  max out bro  10-8-6-4  we'll do 
[03:25:00]  cool downs  yeah  negatives  bro  let's do the  negatives  oh you should  have seen Bill  doing the negatives  I used to hate  whenever I went  back to the gym  because I  you know there  was always like  that big thing  at the very least  when you walked  up to the bench  you had to have  the big 45s  on there  but you know  if I had been  there for a while  I'd have to put  the 35s on  and that was  just the fucking  worst  that's my one  thing in life  is that if I  walk by a bench  I swear to god  it's so funny  you said that  yeah  like the one  thing that keeps  me from fucking  panicking 
[03:25:30]  is I can sit  down I can bang  out like 10  and it'll hurt  but I'm like  okay good  I got away  from that dude  I got more  into like grip  strength shit  like climbing rope  pegboard  that's what you  need more of  yeah  I mean  but you  pegboard  that's like  vision quest  stuff man  that's cool  yeah  oh I  you know  what sucks  my garage  ceiling isn't  high enough  to have one  so I got  the long  skinny one  and I just  put it to the  side  so I'm able  to go up  one and then  I can go  over  like you're 
[03:26:00]  supposed to  rearrange  matchsticks  to make  a pattern  I don't  know if that  made any  sense  but it's  still  it's  still  that's  amazing  you can  go across  so you can  ever reach  up and pull  up  yeah but I  didn't know  but I can do  other things  with it  I've actually  can you  lower yourself  and lift up  your legs  like  I can pull  up  no but you  you don't  understand  when you go  to buy  a pegboard  how much  fucking  clearance  you need  because you're  going up 
[03:26:30]  like I don't  even think  no this  wouldn't work  yeah this  one would  work  you could  actually do  it in your  garage  but my  dude my  garage is  made for  like a  fucking  model T  you know  Ford  it's an  old house  it's for  Al Capone  yeah  little people  back there  exactly  but you  know  alright so  you get  laid off  in the  warehouse  and you  get into  your dad's  dental  office  and I  just worked  there part  time because  I was  working my  way through  college  and he  you know  I just 
[03:27:00]  I handed  him the  shit  and then  he did  it  and I  got  certified  to take  x-rays  I can still  pour up  models and  stuff  I still  remember how  to do  all that  but that's  also why  when I go  to the  airport  I always  opt out  on the  screen  you're  out of your  fucking mind  to go through  one of those  dude when I  used to take  an x-ray  tooth  just your  incisor  alright  let's say  what is that  what is that  899877  number 6  I used to know  those  6 and 11  this sounds  nazi-ish right  now  you numbering  my teeth 
[03:27:30]  seems a little  nazi-ish  take them as  trophies  they're still  in your mouth  if I was to  x-ray your  number 6  tooth  number 6  yeah  I put  the film  right behind  it  the camera  was like  probably  maybe  I don't  know  like 3 inches  circumference  the x-ray  machine  I would put  a lead  vest  on your  organs  all your  vitals  over your  fucking  groin  and then  I would  leave  the room  just to  take a  picture  of your  fucking 
[03:28:00]  tooth  just to  take a  picture  of your  tooth  I know  they do  but you  go to  the fucking  airport  you stand  there  spread eagle  you do  the jay-z  signal  right  and they  fucking  hover  they light  you up  from the  top  other than  your taint  everything  gets blasted  on the way  out and the  way back  I do  like 2 to  3 road  trips  a month  so that  would be  6 times  a month  times 12  months  what's 12  times 6  what is 72  72 fucking  days out of  the year  I'm gonna 
[03:28:30]  stand there  and there's  nothing that  kills me  about it  they fucking  if you're  like 12  or under  they stick  you through  the old  thing  because  evidently  there's  enough  radiation  I guess  to fucking  retard  the puberty  process  so I'm  supposed to  fucking  go through  that  hold on  I gotta  tell you  by the way  Bill Burr  correctly  using the  word  retard  not using  it as a  slur  actually  correctly  using  retard  in an  actual  proper  way  kudos  thank you  please  don't ask  me to  define  it  I'm one 
[03:29:00]  of those  people  I can hear  people use  a word  and I  get the  idea  how to  use  it  I can't  spell  it  or define  it  so when  you go  you ask  for  stop  and slow  down  you retard  someone's  growth  you  mentally  retarded  you stopped  evolving  mentally  I don't  know if  evolving  was right  we just  keep doing  a fuck  up the  sentence  pyramid  we just  got a  city  of shit  around  this  look what  we made  I just  picked  words  on the  $20,000 
[03:29:30]  pyramid  and everyone  is just  like  pass  come back  to that  one  this  thing  that  pass  I don't  remember  the word  it's a  place  you just  keep saying  I don't  remember it  and I just  keep saying  it in the  wrong way  you and I  playing  scrabble  just staring  at a  blank board  for two  hours  so  you always  go for the  pat down  unless  I'm really  hung over  or I just  don't have it  in me  because they  make you  wait  but the other  thing too  is they go  okay stand  right here  and they have you  standing right 
[03:30:00]  next to the  machine  and I always  say well the  whole purpose  is not to be  near that  thing  and then what  I love  is these  fucking  people who  work there  and they go  actually this  one is totally  safe  oh really  person who  doesn't even  know how that  fucking thing  works  quit spewing  out what  they just  told you  you said  they said  the first  one was  safe  the first  one was  safe  and they  did  they zapped  people for  like a year  year and a  half with  that one  and then they  went oh wait  a minute  wait a minute  evidently that  isn't safe  and now they  got one that's  a little more  safer  so they just 
[03:30:30]  all I took  away from  that not all  but mostly  what I took  away from  that story  is they  can't see  my taint  if I need  to smuggle  anything I  put on  the taint  you said  it gets  everything  but the  taint  oh here's  something that  happened one  time I  went through  with I had  like sweatpants  on right  and  so  so  there's  strip club  in the  airport  no no  so I  fucking  go  go through  right  and  and you  know I  say yeah  I'm gonna  opt out  so the  guy does  the whole  fucking  thing  standing 
[03:31:00]  and he's  the back  of my  hand  do you  have any  sensitive  areas  you know  and I'm  like you  know  we all  have  sensitive  areas  now  so he  does  the  whole  fucking  thing  and then  when he  goes to  swab down  my  suitcase  he does  something  wrong  in the  machine  and he  goes  ah shit  and he  knew he  fucked  up  he goes  sorry  we gotta  do more  of a  pat down  he goes  we gotta  bring you  into the  private room  so he  bring me  in the  private  room  and this  guy  like  went across  my dick  with the  back of his  hand  over my 
[03:31:30]  sweatpants  like  like a  windshield  wiper  he went  like  like three  fucking  times  and I  almost  started  laughing  I'm  like  what are  you doing  we think  you're  smuggling  a dick  I  yeah  exactly  yeah  I was  just like  what are  you doing  and I  fucking  I  just laughed  I was  in the  room  and I  was just  laughing  as this  guy was  basically  slapping my  dick  the back  of his  hand  with  another  dude  was  standing  there  watching  it  what's  that  got 
[03:32:00]  to do  with  the  luggage  test  getting  messed  up  what could  be in  your  luggage  he  did  something  I don't  know  you know  they do  that's a  bomb  thing  yeah  they do  the little  swap  thing  he went  to stick  it  he goes  ah  shit  I'm  sorry  and I  don't  think  he  really  messed  up  no  next  thing  you know  no  if I  actually  had  some  bomb  shit  in there  I wouldn't  be talking  to you  right now  I'd be in  Hong Kong  with that  whistleblower  that hero  whoa  that fucking  hero  hero  dude  you can't  come on  man  I don't  know enough  about it  to have  an opinion  on it  at all  let me  do the reading 
[03:32:30]  I don't  either  so let me  give you  my uninformed  opinion  that's too  much  fucking  power  that's  right  that's too  much  power  for anybody  to have  alright  that's too  much  footage  for people  to be  working  with  and you  can cut  the movie  he's the lead  singer of  Iron Maiden  he's supposed  wait what are  we talking  about  I'm talking  about like  you can't  have  if you're the  lead singer  you're gonna  oh we're talking  about two  completely  different things  I'm talking  about the  the NSA  I was talking  about lead  singer having  bad attitudes  on stage  oh okay 
[03:33:00]  I'll go with  that  I'll tell you  right now  if I was  an Iron Maiden  there's no  fucking way  I'd get on  that flight  if Bruce  Dickinson  was flying  he's the  lead singer  so  he already  got a regular  I'm not a  rock star  anymore  haircut  so he  already  looks weird  yeah he's  got like  a weird  like  but he  doesn't  he doesn't  look like  a pilot  and he  doesn't  look like  a rock  star  anymore  oh  what about  Travolta  would you  fly with  Travolta  absolutely  and I  would  want him  up there  why  keep him 
[03:33:30]  up there  so he  doesn't  fucking  come out  and try  to fucking  rub me  down  I've  already  had enough  traumatic  shit  with my  sweatpants  at the  airport  John Travolta  TSA  agent  oh I  messed up  your bag  Mr. Burr  I'm sorry  I just  enjoy your  sweatpants  I still  have it  I don't  understand  Bill Burr  of the  Bill Burr  Monday  morning  podcast  you can  get it  on iTunes  I did  today  to honor  my  commitment  with you  because of  my  Conti text  I can  totally see  how the  text reads  Conti  oh yeah  and I'm  also out of  my mind  I just  wanted to 
[03:34:00]  start some  shit  and basically  so I  made fun  on Twitter  said ask  him about  his weird  text  so he  obviously  talked about  it  sometimes  I made  fun of it  on my  podcast  so people  would listen  to this  one  because I  go that's  going to be  the first  topic we  talk about  which of  course it  wasn't  and then  when I  try to  say you  know what  I jammed  you up  what did  you say  then you  legitimately  apologized  and then I  got all  shocks  yeah you're  not used  to that  you're used  to the  what the  fuck am  I supposed  to  yeah you  I think  when you're  married with  kids  the fight's  gone 
[03:34:30]  you just  go  you know  what  because I  started to  defend it  is that  what's on  your arm  right there  okay I  will  is that  like to  your wife  it's a  long story  yes it  does read  okay I  will  take out  the  okay I  will  what did  you say  Jay don't  bring your  muddy shoes  well I'm  fucking  okay I  will  did you  take the  lint out  of the  dry  screen  okay I  will  can you  can you  take it  I  don't  okay I  will  who me  no JJ  behind you  could he  do it  oh my  mother 
[03:35:00]  sounds like  the lady  from  public  village  village  um I  know  it's been  so long  since I've  seen  oh so  yeah when  you uh  I was  going when  you're married  with I  don't know  you know I  think I've  gotten in so  many arguments  and I've  been wrong  so many  times and  I've been to  therapy enough  and actually  this is not to  get like  fucking uh  hippy dippy  actually like  very few  grown-ups try  to work on  themselves but  I realized  apparently I  am the  problem  you know  yeah I'm 
[03:35:30]  the problem  that's like  known  and you  go  awesome  you go uh  in my mind  I started to  defend it and  you said it  was cunty and  I go well if  he felt it was  cunty that's  his feelings you  can't argue with  how fucking  bill feels and  so then I just  went I well  yeah and it  ended it  yeah it's  fucking and it  was a legal hit  it was like  throwing a ball  I can't even get  mad I was just  that was a good  hit you know  gotta go back to  the huddle  it's like throwing  a ball against a  mushy wall it 
[03:36:00]  just doesn't even  bounce back  the fuck was  that the guy  just laid down  for it  you know what's  the worst though  is when somebody  apologizes and  you're not ready  to accept their  apology and  they're like what  the fuck I  said I'm sorry  are they just  what I said I'm  sorry aren't you  gonna let it go  it's like no I  still want to be  I have that like  I know I want to  be mad at you  for a while  I understand that  completely because  I need you to  understand why  what you said was  fucked up and  you haven't let me  get that out so  your apology can't  possibly be sincere  because I got  four reasons why 
[03:36:30]  what you said to  me was so out  of line I got  halfway through the  first reason and  you just jumped  the fucking  barrier and went  hey man I'm  really sorry bro  you're right  you're right  sorry  hey you want to  go get an ice  cream  no  wait a minute  I'm still  pissed  second reason  there's four  reasons and  you just it's  like you jumped  the line on  me I  completely  understand I  hate when  people do  that too  you know it  drives me more  crazy  should be a  word for  that  like the  preemptive  apology  this is a  Seinfeld episode  right now  it is  or Larry  David  give me the 
[03:37:00]  bullshit  apology  jumped the  line  yeah  there's a  bullshit  hey  preemptive  hey  preemptive  I hate  when you make  a bet  this makes me  bananas  when you make  a bet with  somebody  and they  win  and when you  go to pay  them  they go  nah it's  alright man  you're like  what  that means  if I won  you weren't  going to pay  me  like if  we bet  $20  on like  a Blackhawks  Bruins game  and I win 
[03:37:30]  and I go  to give you  $20  you go  I don't want  your money  like well  what the  fuck  did we  bet for  it was  kind of  a big  deal  at the  time  to me  I bet  because I  wanted  your  $20  you just  throw it  at him  and you  walk away  you know  what  do the  right  thing  with  Danny  it's  $200  $250  Mookie's  a rich  fucking  man  he's  never  gonna have  to worry  about  nothing  ever again  in his  life  it's  a great  movie  yeah  you just  brought up  Pope  Gordon's  Village  that was  one of my  favorites  you gotta  rewatch it  because it's  Eric Roberts 
[03:38:00]  and Mickey  Rourke  and both  of them  easily could  have won  the Oscar  fuck  nominated  like Mickey  Rourke  has become  like this  wacky guy  like watch  Pope  Gordon's  Village  he's still  great  he's like  gorgeous  like crazy  dreamboat  hot  and he's  amazing  and you  believe that he  walks right into  the den of the  mob and  goes  this may be  your church  but this is  my village  I'm the  Pope  of  Gordon's  Village  I got  the tapes  that could  take you down  Burt Young's  hand  I love  they're shaking  hands  Burt Young 
[03:38:30]  won't let  go of his  hands  Barney  some Irish  hard on  I don't  know him  nothing  two guys  not three  and he's got  the little  stubby  Superman  would have  cracked  yeah  they  pressed  me  Superman  he goes  you gave  him  Barney  then they're  gonna get  the  Barney  Barney's  gonna give  them me  what a  fucking  great  movie  Eric  Roberts  that  right  there  we  fucking  broke  it  down  and he's  the  what  episode  I gotta  listen  three or  four  way back  you have  to unlock  the premium 
[03:39:00]  content  though  even if I  wanted to  I could  I can't  figure  anything  I can't  either  I don't  you know  it's weird  is with  technology  I've  basically  I've  become  illiterate  like I'm  becoming  like this  frontiersman  but you do  the podcast  by yourself  Matt  if Matty  Boy  wasn't  alive  I wouldn't  have a  know  what  to  do  yeah  but people  constantly  complain about  the levels  and the  production  value of  it  and  I  just  do  the  pre  mine  I just  do  the  preemptive  you're 
[03:39:30]  absolutely  right  it's  terrible  quality  I'm  sure  there's  a lot  of  other  podcasts  out  there  that  I  like  your  podcast  I  had  one  complaint  once  I  was  on  a  movie  set  and  I  was  just  listening  to  like  48  years  in  a  row  and  there  like  three  podcasts  during  football  season  I  know  you're  watching  Monday Night  Football  during  like  come  on  catch  the  fucking  ball  all right  so  anyway  you know  you know  and what I  didn't realize  was it was  also like  by the time  you  listen to  it  the fucking  month  after  yeah  or  years  later  you're  listening  to it 
[03:40:00]  so  I'm  fucking  bitching  about  Brian  Sipe  Michael  Jackson  wide  receiver  Brian  Brian  Sipe  one of  my  favorite  teams  the  Cardiac  Kicks  that's  arguably  one of  the best  uniforms  in football  it's just  not associated  when they  have the  brown  jerseys  with the  white  numbers  and just  that  orange  helmet  forget it  they have  a Boston  like the  old school  Boston  thing  where  it  wasn't  they  didn't  have  the  decency  to  just  suck  they  had  to  get 
[03:40:30]  almost  there  and  just  you  know  have  all  the  wheels  come  off  yeah  they  lost  in  amazing  ways  on this  moving  forward  in  movies  is  it's  the  first  guy  that  I  saw  in  a  movie  that  there  was  no  reason  Mickey  Rourke  and  Eric  Roberts  there's  no  in  real  life  if  you  had  a  friend  like  Eric  Robert  the  movie  opens  with  Mickey  Rourke  getting  ready  for  work  he's  made  a  day  10  minutes  into  the  evening  Eric 
[03:41:00]  Roberts  gets  fired  and  Mickey  doesn't  put  all  the  entrees  on  he's  not  writing  down  the  orders  and  he's  taking  direct  money  from  the  customers  but  Mickey  Rourke  has  vouched  for  him  like  40  times  and  he  goes  if  he  ever  does  it  again  you're  out  too  because  it's  a  mob  restaurant  so  Mickey  Rourke  gets  fired  too  that's  like  10  minutes  into  the  movie  now  in  real  life  you  go  fuck  this  guy  I  gotta  eat  now  I  gotta  look  for  a  goddamn  job  so  when  you  watch  the  movie  in  real  life  there's  always  the  thing  for  me  because  I  always  read  for  the  tick  the  character  is  post  Bob  sugar  like  oh 
[03:41:30]  you  know  it would  be  great  to  be  a  real  asshole  is  how  do  I  make  this  guy  likable  because  you  can't  because  in  real  life  you  would  never  hang  out  with  that  guy  Eric  Roberts  was  the  first  guy  in  movies  I  ever  saw  there  is  no  reason  Mickey  Rourke  should  hang  out  with  that  person  but  the  way  Eric  Roberts  plays  him  there's  something  about  him  Mickey  Rourke  almost  has to  mother  and  nurture  and  bring  out  why  you  care  Charlie  ain't  got  no  job  to  wear  it  to  that's  right  I  don't  because  you  stole  let's 
[03:42:00]  watch  the sun  come  up  oh  yeah  he's  got  the  champagne  oh  yeah  the  movie  is  all  about  a  heist  it's  incredible  that's  right  Daryl  Hannah  we can't  give away  too much  for people  I haven't  seen  but she's  always  why  are you  hanging  yeah  but you  know  and even  the cops  they go  are they  related  when I was  born  with the wind  was old  friends of the  show  this has been  Jay Moore's  podcast  more stories  for more info  go to  jaymoor.com  that's

[03:51:30]  hindmose arctic adventure yeah that was  the first thing that i found that's how i  found out about you guys oh i watched  that i watched it twice in a row because  a it was so fascinating first of all  that there's this guy who's not a dumb  guy no he was a smart guy and he was  very like very articulate and really  passionate about the way he was living  his life in this really harmonious way  hunting and gathering in the middle of  nowhere yeah with a log shack and his  wife and i believe at the time he was 
[03:52:00]  the most romantic remote person on earth  that's why we did it it's incredible  it's a it was such a fascinating thing  this guy had never seen the towers fall  yeah i mean the most iconic shit in the  the history of this country and he had  never seen that he had just heard of it  yeah i mean he was so remote and so  self-reliant and it was utterly  fascinating really fascinating uh so and  though being so heartbreaking too and he  was talking about losing his child the the 
[03:52:30]  canoe tipped over and they lost their baby i  mean dude it was oh my god it was so so  heartbreaking but it's so fascinating it's  really fast it's like into the wild if the  guy wasn't an idiot yes like if the guy  actually knew what he was doing i think  that into the wild guy i mean i i need to  uh really look at the story better because  all i know is the movie i saw the movie and  i believe that the movie doesn't represent  the truth for whatever reason they decided  to make it out that he'd eaten some poison 
[03:53:00]  right but it wasn't really poison he just  starved to death right he didn't know what  he was doing yeah well i think that's a  shitty thing to do man yeah i think that's  a shitty thing to do to make a movie and  put this artificial ending to a semi-historical  event i mean he's he's like a sort of a  poetic figure this guy who just goes off  into the woods and yeah you know becomes  this you should know maybe a bit more  about it i mean how about know something  about it he didn't know anything the thing  ohio is like he can just live in the middle 
[03:53:30]  of nowhere yeah and and just live well it  never gets warm first of all he doesn't  need he doesn't need a refrigerator yeah  no yeah he's hanging this caribou on these  sticks outside of his house like the the  scene is so crazy because this dude has all  his food hanging from frozen slabs on these  trees and then bears come around and he has  to kill the bear i mean it is  fucking bananas well what was interesting  about that is the bear was tracking the team  so they left to go shooting and went off 
[03:54:00]  and the bear was tracking them it was  hunting them oh my god and and so everyone  was was aware of it and then hymo goes  oh yeah by the way we're being tracked like he  was totally knew it he understood it he goes  and if if the bear comes in comes tonight it's  going to come tonight and if it does then we're  going to have to shoot it because otherwise it's  going to get us jesus christ so uh so sadly they they  had to shoot it sadly my ass that's a  fucking giant monster wants to eat people  i fucking get crazy when people go you know 
[03:54:30]  it's really fucked up those people shouldn't  have been there in the first place sure but they  were okay but they were team people okay but  they were right the guy had of course he had to  shoot that fucking bear what are you just  gonna move you're gonna move now well i  mean and he lives there and and it was  actually tracking him because i guess it you  know got some of the meat from before but uh  yeah we they they they brought it back it's in  our office the head no the the skin the body  the taxidermy the body oh yeah they have to when 
[03:55:00]  you shoot one don't you have to process the skull in  some way don't you have to like send it to uh  the uh fish and game no idea i think that was like one  of the things that was said was that it's uh when you when  you shoot a bear and i should get my shit straight on  this but i think there's something along those lines  like if you shoot a bear self-defense you have to send the skull somewhere i  thought hemo had to deal that deal with that wasn't there one of  wasn't that part of it maybe i don't remember maybe i'm confusing my bear  things i've always been fascinated by bear we  we went to and i don't know if you saw but we went to another 
[03:55:30]  now the most remote person on earth is this uh i don't know if you heard they  live in siberia in the mountains and they were like uh  russian orthodox during the revolution and they took off during the  revolution and they're still there well there's one now she's like 85 she was the  youngest and uh she lives there in the middle of nowhere on this mountain  in like this crazy sod place with like and they didn't have shoes i'm like how  do you how do you how do your feet not freeze that's  incredible yeah oh my god they don't have shoes yeah 
[03:56:00]  how cold is it fucking cold it's no serious  yeah no frostbite i gotta i gotta watch it again but there was they were  it was going on about no shoes now they have shoes and now they have like they  wrapped their in furs and stuff but when they first went there they didn't have  shoes and you're like how can you not have shoes they must have wrapped it in  something or maybe they stayed in during the winter that is so crazy  barefoot in siberia yeah you can google it it's it's a totally insane story there  was like five of them living on this mountain in the middle of nowhere  with nothing they had nothing they had zero that's insane so they're like 
[03:56:30]  they're almost like like just super evolved monkeys  yeah you know they're like well it's interesting because i was like  if you actually take away everything like there's no matches like you know you maybe  you had matches the first five years or the first year the first five hours  but like 80 years later there's no they don't have matches you don't have  you know glass you don't have you don't have anything so to go back to really  primal like we have nothing but you know that there's another world out 
[03:57:00]  there it's not like oh i don't know anything like they when they went it was  like the 20s or 30s so they had like cars and shit planes wow  so how did they get by how were they cooking their food well the first it was  like the first decade they were just eating like roots and they were starving  in the winter and they couldn't get berries and stuff and then by the end  they you know they were like 65 and just running through the forest like  catching like animals by hand and stuff and you're like 65 years old i mean they 
[03:57:30]  were sort of super cut and tough but they got animals by hand yeah well  they had snares and they would run them into like you know traps and stuff  but uh god but then they were really religious but then there was some weird  sex shit that was going down of course going on down there yeah if you leave a  bunch of people by themselves they're fucking each other in very weird ways  once they realize no one's looking once you realize that there's no one else but  them how many people were that were up there it wasn't a lot it was like it was a 
[03:58:00]  family and they had like two or three girls i believe and then there was the  parents and then like uncle peter wanted to lie with chinchetska or whatever oh my god  you know jesus christ yeah if you only have a small group like that it's going to be a mess  it gets it gets it gets lord of the flies quickly yeah what is it about humans it's so disappointing  like consistently it's pretty interesting if you strip away like cops and artifice yeah you know  modernity and technology we just go it quickly very quickly we go ape really quickly yeah yeah 
[03:58:30]  i don't know i i just uh as i get older especially the the broad spectrum of our ability whether it's  to be just utter complete cunt merciless killer gingas khan style it's like super nice philanthropist  person yeah like the broad spectrum of what people are capable of yeah it's it hurts your brain yeah  because it's so there's there's so much conflict going on there's so much weirdness and the potentials 
[03:59:00]  for human behavior and what it's all based on like the the principles of thinking and the the the feeling  of camaraderie you're supposed to have with your community and extending that to people that you  haven't met before and don't disregard them because the numbers are so high that you're you're  overwhelmed with people that you say you know you lose a sense of community i was reading this book  uh and i and i saw a word that i didn't know so i googled it and they were like it's this empire just 
[03:59:30]  before the byzantine empire and uh and then i i just sort of went down the wikipedia page and they're  like and it's this empire and then this emperor killed this emperor and then took his wife and then  they married somebody else in another empire to save it but then they ended up you know going  and you're reading going this is fucking game of thrones like they were just they were just kingdoms  all fully killing each other trying to marry and then they would have a kid and then the kid would come </pre>
