<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show covered a wide range of topics throughout its broadcast.  The show opened with a continuation of their ongoing feud with Orlando radio host Jim Phillips.  Opie and Anthony detailed how their listeners, the "pests," were systematically harassing Phillips through phone calls, online attacks on sites like wackbag.com and opanthony.net, and coordinated actions. They highlighted Phillips's increasingly frantic responses, his attempts to deflect the attacks, and criticism of his co-host's lack of contribution, using offensive language in their descriptions.  Opie mentioned a $100,000 bet regarding a caller claiming to be an XM employee.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the harassment of Phillips, often employing offensive language. Opie also expressed his dislike for Anthony during this segment, showcasing their own internal conflict.  The hosts promoted their "Pest" t-shirts and encouraged further listener harassment of Phillips.

The show then shifted to listener verification of a previous guest, Eric Logan (ELO), with Opie making a vulgar bet to confirm his authenticity.  They announced a future show dedicated to listener-submitted content, including a listener-created "Opie's Flub Mix." A substantial portion focused on the planned random bag searches on NYC subways following the London bombings.  The hosts expressed strong, inflammatory opinions about the policy's effectiveness and potential for racial profiling, playing audio clips from the NYPD Commissioner and various listener calls offering diverse perspectives, many containing offensive language. A caller described a chaotic scene at Penn Station during the bag checks, using offensive language to describe different groups of people. The segment concluded with further discussion of the subway searches, more listener calls, and humorous, exaggerated fear-mongering news teases.  There was also a brief discussion of the movie *Bad News Bears*.

Next, the hosts discussed double parking in New York City. A caller, Nate from Brooklyn, described his wife receiving a $150 ticket for double parking while parallel parking.  This led to tangents about the hosts' road rage incidents (throwing golf balls at other drivers), a critique of their listening skills from a caller named Ben, and a celebration of Martini Steve's birthday with truffles.  A new, profanity-laden show intro created by Martini Steve debuted.  The discussion touched upon various scams, including a story about a traffic agent issuing erroneous tickets. Old Dirty Bastard joined the show as a guest, sharing his expertise on scams, specifically regarding deliveries and recounting his experiences at Rikers Island. The segment also included discussion of Natalia, a woman featured in *New York* magazine, previously involved with the hosts and a now-incarcerated owner of NYConfidential.com, and audio from her appearance on *The Donnie Deutsch Show*. Martini Steve was a guest in studio alongside Old Dirty Bastard.

A call to Joe, a member of a U2 tribute band in Nantucket, followed.  The conversation covered Joe's piloting skills, his band's international touring schedule, and gambling plans with the hosts.  They discussed the band's use of YouTube for booking gigs and a song from their repertoire, "Dry Vagina," and its potential airing on XM.  The conversation returned to the feud with Jim Phillips, with a call from Jason Ferguson, a reporter from the *Orlando Weekly*, seeking information for an article.  Several "pests" called in to describe their actions against Phillips. The show also revisited the New York Confidential escort agency, its owner's arrest, and played audio from Natalia's interview on *The Donnie Deutsch Show*.  They discussed a Texas congresswoman's complaint about hurricane names being "lily white," leading to a humorous and offensive debate. Jimmy Norton was mentioned as being asleep during portions of this segment.

The show concluded with a segment focused on a comedic discussion of hurricane names. The hosts made racially charged jokes about hurricane names, suggesting older names were "white names" and inventing offensive, fictitious "black" names, using racial slurs and crude sexual references. They interspersed actual hurricane names with further racially charged and vulgar jokes.  The segment ended with a chaotic, nonsensical exchange filled with more offensive language and seemingly unrelated statements about a cook, a Cleveland event, and the hosts' departure.  No guests were explicitly named in studio for this final segment.

[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, exactly.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Oh, fucking idiot.  Oh, fucking idiot. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, fucking idiot.  Fucking idiot.  Look at idiots. Look at idiots.  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth. 
[00:05:30]  Hello, folk faith.  Do you want to kiss me?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Experience.  Friday edition.  Yes, I want to go on record and say that I really do hate Anthony behind the scenes.  Oh.  This is all a clever, clever mirage.  A ruse.  A ruse.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  I got to start off by saying that I am just so proud to be part of this Opie and Anthony  show.  Absolutely.  And now I completely understand.  I'm just a little part of this Opie and Anthony show.  Just a piece.  Oh yeah, my name's on the show and all, but come on now.  Yeah.  Is it really our show?  Not if they don't want it to be.  Unbelievable.  Because, boy, these listeners have the potential of just destroying things. 
[00:06:30]  Just wrecking.  They're a wrecking crew.  Absolutely.  I don't even know where to begin.  First of all, if you're a new listener of the show, you got to join a fan site.  You just got to.  Because when this show goes off the air, that's when the real fun begins now.  It's unbelievable.  Things happen.  With the photoshopping and the discussions and the chat rooms and the hooking up and  the sex and the violence and the...  It's insane.  There's all kinds of shenanigans going on.  It's almost like this radio show doesn't even matter anymore. 
[00:07:00]  It's all about what's going on on the internet, on the message boards.  Yeah, it's just a common thread.  This is like the common denominator that they have to work with.  There was a whole show that was going on after we went off the air on the message boards.  I mean, it was just...  And these guys, they've been up all night.  They were throwing slumber parties at each other's houses.  They were drinking and...  It's scary.  It really is.  I mean, some of the websites, they're listed on opanthony.com, but whackbag.com is a great 
[00:07:30]  one.  opanthony.net is a great one.  And then you got some other ones that are pretty good, too, like cringehumor.net and  wowfans and, I don't know, thechurchofopi.org.  What?  There's all kinds of stuff going on out there.  Extracurricular activities going on for this program.  I got to tell you what happened.  You know, this Jim Phillips guy down in Orlando, he's a one-market sensation.  Got to give him credit where credit's due.  He's one of these guys that does great in one city. 
[00:08:00]  And there's radio guys all over America that do exactly that.  Every town has one.  Yeah, they're great in their hometown, but that's it.  You know, they all had dreams to be heard across America, but they just didn't have what  it takes to get the job done now, you know?  And they'll always say, well, no, I've always just wanted to be in one market.  That's like the excuse.  But if you get into radio, your dream is to be syndicated, to be a big star, be as successful  as you possibly can be.  And they don't realize how small they really are, because in their city, they're huge. 
[00:08:30]  You know, everyone recognizes them and stuff.  But as soon as they cross the border or something, they're nobodies.  Absolute nobodies.  And this bothers radio people, I'm telling you.  It bothers them.  Because everyone's goal, when you get into this, is to be heard by as many people as possible  and to be syndicated to as many cities as possible.  Yeah.  And with XM...  How you base your success in the business.  And with XM, we're heard everywhere in America now.  Right.  Everywhere.  And I got to tell you, you know, this Jim Phillips got under our skin because we finally got sick 
[00:09:00]  of these commercial radio assholes claiming that Anthony and I are failures, that we wrecked  our careers, that we have no listeners, that we're desperate, and that's why we went on  XM.  So we finally decided, you know what?  We're going to prove how many listeners we actually do have, you scumbag.  Yeah, this is a perfect example of how many people listen to and are dedicated to this  program.  It's the ability to mobilize people to absolutely destroy another person's program. 
[00:09:30]  And whether they believe it or not, the people on the other show believe it or not, your show  is being trashed on a daily basis.  I listened.  I'm not going to be like Jim Phillips.  I'm not going to be like him and go, yeah, I got people who listen.  People listen and they told me that they said this.  We know he was listening.  Just stop it. 
[00:10:00]  He's just full of lies.  Stop with the lying already.  You know, I was listening to his show yesterday and he was completely taken out of his program,  out of his element.  He is incapable now of doing a show, doing the show that I know he wants to go in there  and do on a daily basis, which is take calls from his fans and discuss current events, topics,  play their games, whatever it is that he does.  I've never heard him before, I'll be honest with that.  I've never tuned this guy in until this all started happening. 
[00:10:30]  So he absolutely wants to do his show and he is absolutely being prevented from doing it by our pests.  And they will keep doing this.  This guy, because I know he listens, whether it's now or the replay or whatever.  I know he listens.  This will continue.  You will be taken out of your element every single day.  You will be incapable of doing your show.  It might have been a novelty the first day, a little entertaining. 
[00:11:00]  You might think you twisted it so your fans are maybe enjoying this or something.  That's all well and fine.  This will continue.  And in a week, is it going to be as much fun and entertaining and a novelty?  Two weeks, three, a month of every day being taken out of your show?  I don't think so.  I think you're getting frustrated.  You can hear it in his voice.  And his rebuttals, his attacks that he does back. 
[00:11:30]  And again, it might sound like I'm being biased because he's such a tool.  But I would give credit where credit's due.  I've done it in the past with people we couldn't stand.  I've said, wow, you know, I hate this guy, but goddamn, that was funny.  This guy has nothing.  There is nothing there.  We were listening yesterday.  I was on some of the chat rooms listening with some of the pests.  It was a lot of fun.  They were super psyched, very into it, highly motivated, and very funny on the chats. 
[00:12:00]  They were commenting back and forth to what he was saying, and I'm throwing shit in there, and everyone's laughing.  It was a great time.  It was like a message board radio show going on.  And he just had nothing.  He was taken out of his show and had nothing.  And it was very entertaining.  Well, that's what you get from a one-market sensation.  You know, in the end, they don't have the chops to go with something like this, you know.  I was getting updates while I was hanging out in Little Italy. 
[00:12:30]  Ooh.  Yeah, holding corn in Little Italy because that's what I do now.  Holding, did you have an espresso?  A little espresso, and my phone's ringing.  I'm getting updates from Jimmy and the gang.  Oh, yeah, it was just wonderful.  Nice.  Feeling really good about what we do, to be honest with you.  Where you're walking down the street with your head up high, just taking apples off the apple carts.  Waving your hand around in a white suit.  Grabbing dresses off of the horse-drawn carriages.  I was calling in all sorts of orders from a little table outside Joey Paisano's restaurant. 
[00:13:00]  Drinking his espresso.  Sitting up there in Sierra Mounds.  That's what I was doing.  Taking cell phone calls.  I was in the dick joke business with his father.  But a bunch of updates.  Opie Olive Oil.  A bunch of updates.  Now, let's remember that Mr. Phillips there said to bring it on, right? 
[00:13:30]  He said, bring it on.  I can take what you guys have.  What a set of balls.  Bring it on.  What a brave guy.  Well, just like we predicted, he went to his big bosses, and now there's a legal thing going on where we're not allowed to play his audio.  Yeah.  To cease and desist.  Cease and desist.  He ran to a clear channel.  And how bad is this guy that he was actually coming back from every break, talking about the cease and desist, going, you know, there's going to be...  You faggot, you're supposed to be doing a comedy talk show, and you're boring your listeners with cease and desist information every time you come back? 
[00:14:00]  Every time.  Because he couldn't go to the phones.  Well, the reality is most radio guys do not have a sense of humor.  Even the guys that are supposedly doing a comedy show, when it comes down to it, they don't have a sense of humor.  Most of these guys are definite liars.  Most of them are hacks.  They have no pride in actually coming up with their own shit on their radio show.  It's a joke.  It's a joke business.  It really is.  And at this point, we take on all commercial radio. 
[00:14:30]  Simple as this.  This is just a little example of what we have in store for commercial radio.  I wish I could convey to the people that didn't hear the show how badly he's handling this.  How he goes on.  It is the same break.  He'll do the same break, and I guess it lasts for maybe seven minutes or something like that.  And then he goes into commercial breaks.  And then he comes back and says, I swear, it's just like this.  Let me tell everybody what's going on here. 
[00:15:00]  Let me fill everybody in on what's going on.  Sniff and snort.  Donald and...  He comes up with wacky names for us that don't mean anything.  They're not funny or clever or demeaning or anything.  It's somebody with a complete lack of creativity or ad-libbing skills trying to be funny.  And the only one laughing is his lackey and that pork slit that sits next to him. 
[00:15:30]  That meat pocket that sits next to him just cackling and chuckling.  But there's nothing there.  And he'll recap again for the 80th time what's going on and then try to get us by commenting on facial hair or clothing or haircuts in a way that isn't even that funny.  It isn't even that funny. 
[00:16:00]  Well, he did say, bring it on.  And then this jizz bag gets on.  First thing he says on the air tomorrow, yesterday, you can call because he knew he was going to get slammed.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't care.  If he has listeners, where are they?  Why are they not calling to support his show?  He first gets on and goes, well, we can't mention the names.  This faggot, you faggot.  The boss has called him.  Don't mention Opie and Anthony's names.  And he buckled.  Okay, sir.  Okay.  It's exactly like that scene in Stripes.  Well, we're on our way to bingo parlors.  Shut up. 
[00:16:30]  Okay, sir.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it was like.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  No Opie and Anthony.  So he's calling you Camiya and Hughes.  Camiya.  Camiya.  You know, kind of sounds like cum with an e at the end.  Wow.  You know, with my name being spelled C-U-M-I-A, that was a new one to me.  He actually came up with something I hadn't heard since the first grade in the playground.  And all through school.  And my own friends goofing on me and stuff.  Boy, that one was just a bit of originality. 
[00:17:00]  Camiya.  Get it?  And Gregory Hughes.  Well, first of all.  Gregory Hughes.  My name's not Gregory.  Yes, it is.  I said it is.  Let me call someone from XM and have them say it is Gregory.  Well, here's the reality.  It's Glenn, by the way.  It's not Gregory.  Here's the reality.  Just to clear it up.  My mom hated the name Gregory.  Hated it.  So, officially, my name is Greg with two G's to make sure no one says Gregory. 
[00:17:30]  But that stands for good gosh.  Got up, hole.  Dick Nose from California.  What's up, Dick Nose?  I just wanted to say good morning about vagina mouth.  He makes me horny.  That was another one.  Hey, you guys.  I'm going to take fashion tips from a Jim Phillips saying that the goatee goes,  Goatee is just done.  It's so yesterday.  Looks like he's got a vagina on his mouth. 
[00:18:00]  And then he started going into this thing where it was like he was getting turned on by my mouth.  And that was the only portion of the entire show where I was like getting creeped out.  I was just going, ugh.  And then he was trying to, I guess, insinuate somehow that I was gay.  By the way, I was dressing like I went for the job at XM dressed in Bermuda shorts and tank top and flip flops.  And then there was some kind of eluding that was so shallow to that I was gay because he's so petrified of any kind of lawsuit or something. 
[00:18:30]  If he implies that I'm gay, that I would then take him to court.  But, you know, why take him to court over the truth?  I wish you wore Bermuda shorts.  I know.  I was thinking actually coming in today in Bermuda shorts.  But, yeah, he was so petrified of a lawsuit that he couldn't even really touch on that in a clever way.  He couldn't commit to it.  And he's not funny enough to do it.  No.  And, first of all, Jim, if Anthony had a vagina, you'd hire it to sit next to you and laugh at your awful jokes. 
[00:19:00]  You're not a funny guy.  And that deadweight hole you have sitting next to you contributes nothing except the tsk, tsk boys attitude of every fucking broad in radio.  There was so many.  Oh, no.  Don't go there.  Oh, don't.  Now?  Hey, hey.  Oh, Jim.  Jim, oh, no.  That's her contribution to that program. 
[00:19:30]  Nothingness.  Well, let's go to the phones.  I mean, these guys have been up all night.  That's how excited they get.  Ryan in Philly.  I just wanted to say, oh, should I answer my question first?  No, go ahead, Ryan.  Oh, are you sure I don't have to answer, like, a ridiculous question?  Oh, what, that was going on, too?  Oh, what he would do is, Ron, let me explain, when a caller would call in, because this guy  was getting his dumb face smashed so hard, he was trying to do something to salvage dignity,  so he would make the caller answer a question. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And that was his idea of being cutting edge and striking back.  So, you know, what's the capital of Alaska?  It's just like, you couldn't even think of funny questions.  Okay, I'll ask you a question.  Who's the useless jizz receptacle?  Fuck you.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Look at them all jotting it down inside.  Mark it.  Time it.  There's pens going crazy.  Receptacle.  All right, well, who's the useless jizz receptacle?  That sits next to Jim Phillips.  Um, sorry, guys. 
[00:20:30]  Don't know.  Not quick enough.  Bye.  No, no, we won't!  Some good stuff to say, though.  Brad in Atlanta.  What's up, Brad?  How's it going, man?  I called in, like, three times yesterday.  The first two times, motherfucker wouldn't even let me get a word in.  Like, right, he asked me the question, and before I could even answer it, gone.  I knew both the answers.  Third time, I got shit-dicked, and I think it only came out on the actual internet play.  But, uh, Opie, do you really hate Anthony?  I can't stand Anthony.  At least it finally came out. 
[00:21:00]  How did it happen?  What did he do?  Oh, no.  And I gotta say, one thing I love about this guy, he's just such a, just a fucking coward.  He comes out, he goes, we can't mention the other guy's names.  I mean, this is a business, you know, and we can't-  Oh, that whole thing.  We can't mention the competition.  Meanwhile, he's being simulcast on XM.  Really, asshole?  You can't, you don't want to mention the competition, and what you're doing is being broadcast on  the one thing that's going to destroy commercial radio?  Yeah.  You really are dumb.  And you're a liar. 
[00:21:30]  And I didn't know he wasn't getting paid for being on XM.  We certainly are.  I had no idea that this dummy, what happens is this, he's not good enough to be syndicated.  Yeah.  So, Clear Channel probably says, look, you're not talented enough to be syndicated, not  in those words, but we'll throw you on XM, and I'll hear you all over the country.  It's like promotion.  Yeah.  You're not paying him.  Great.  You must have some agent.  You really are a fucking dummy.  You get nothing.  Nick in D.C., what's up?  Hi, good morning, everybody.  This is Nick from D.C., Wacky Radio DJ, and I just want to declare at 25 after 7 that 
[00:22:00]  I quit.  I quit.  No more.  That's it.  Yeah.  He's saying he quit because he knows what's coming, because we do have a little secret.  Oh, he knows what's coming.  He knows what's coming.  And he also knows that he's getting the dog shit beaten out of him, and he knows it's  going to continue, and he knows that when these guys call and smash his face, they're  all going to enjoy it on the XM.  There's nothing he can do, so he almost wants to humiliate.  He's humiliated.  Yeah.  It was a fake call.  It was an actor who played Elo, and I will quote my post, because I had a good one, that 
[00:22:30]  we never hired an actor to play Elo.  The only thing we hired on Elo was his hair, and we got that from the set of Life Goes  On.  I was very proud of myself for that.  That was very funny.  But yeah, it was an actor playing it.  That's the best he could come up with.  Someone tell Mr. Phillips, you know, if this is the fake Elo, all right, I'm willing to  bet $100,000 right now.  Jesus, a week's pay?  A week's pay, Opie.  Wow. 
[00:23:00]  Put it back in your pocket, Opie.  You don't have to take it out and lay it on the console.  Let's see how brave this guy is.  He goes on his show and lies once again.  This is Elo from yesterday's program.  All right, so let me ask you the question.  Is Jim Phillips the number one non-music show on XM's satellite radio?  Who?  Who?  Oh, Jesus.  To Jim Phillips, your boss doesn't even know who you are. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, it's, you know, I'll have to look.  I mean, it's not right here.  It's not right on this top page here.  Oh, God damn.  And then a little more from Elo.  Eric Logan.  I can assure you this, that for a non-music channel, he is not the number one rated show  and certainly not the number one rated channel.  And not even close, right?  Not even close would be another very accurate statement as well.  Is he in the top 140? 
[00:24:00]  Well, I think he does actually beat the traffic and weather channels, yes.  Oh, okay.  Congratulations to that, Jim.  Yeah.  I mean, he does have higher ratings than that, so that's...  Props for that one.  So we had Eric Logan on the show yesterday, and then Jim Phillips, because he's a liar like  most of the guys out there, is trying to claim that wasn't Eric Logan.  Yeah, he's saying it was not Eric Logan.  It was an actor, and Opie put up $100,000.  Mr. Phillips, let's have a little bet.  Of course, you'll have something wacky to say about that today on the show. 
[00:24:30]  But seriously, if you're willing to stand by your statement, I'll bet you $100,000.  Here's what I'll do.  $100,000.  If that isn't Eric Logan, you fucking pussy liar, I'll let Sandy Cain come in here.  I'll do it at a live event, and I will suck on Twado.  I would have Sandy Cain on stage.  I will get up there, and for five minutes, I will suck on Twado.  He knows damn well that's Eric Logan.  Of course it is.  Of course he's not going to take the bet. 
[00:25:00]  Because I really want to see that happen.  Of course he's not going to take the bet.  That would never, ever happen.  Of course he won't take the bet.  $100,000.  If you could prove that's not Eric Logan.  Simple as that.  He makes a lot of money, according to him.  He's saying, I don't care how many listeners I have.  I make a great living.  I make a lot of money.  He's bragging about how much money he makes.  That's what we've fucking beaten you to?  Yeah.  You're bragging about the money you make?  Almost like, my wife likes me.  My customers like me.  You fucking shower curtain ring salesman asshole.  I'm the genuine article. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, he got a face smashing, and it's going to keep up.  Yeah, by the way, I can't tell you enough times, this will continue.  I was howling listening to this godwafel show yesterday.  Every call he went to, he was hanging up on.  Before they could say a word, he's so panic-stricken.  Flustered.  That it's going to, A, go out, and the cursing is great,  because he can't trust his phones, because he doesn't want to get an FCC violation.  Yeah, here's what he was saying.  He was saying, call up. 
[00:26:00]  He goes, but I have some rules.  Some rules.  Yeah, bring it on.  First, don't say their name, because this is a business.  This is a business, and we don't want their names going out over the air.  And then I'm going to ask you a question.  If you could answer the question, then I'll allow you to ask me a question.  And that ain't the way it works, douchebag.  That isn't what this is about.  What he was trying to do is take some lemons and make lemonade.  He wanted to take the destruction of his show and turn it into something that might resemble entertainment. 
[00:26:30]  You know, if he's asking questions, it kind of almost seems like a show.  That ain't what it's about, douchebag.  And it's not about us getting our name on your show.  Understand that, too.  This is about taking you out of your show.  This is about destroying your program, making you unable to do a program.  Our listeners will continue calling you and just curse and eat up your delay so you can't go to the phones.  And every time a curse does get through because you guys decided to give us that cease and desist, 
[00:27:00]  we report you to the FCC now.  That's what we do.  There you go.  That's what we do, because now we play, too.  We'll play and have a little fun with you.  Run to your boss's little faggot.  Just like we told you.  We told you the guy would run to his boss.  And then he puts a fake guy on the air, Derek Foynster or something like that.  I talked to Eric Logan.  He came up with some wacky name.  That guy, there's no one by that name that works for XM.  There's not.  He said it was human relations, not human resources.  You know, just another little legal dodge so he can't get in trouble. 
[00:27:30]  And I talked to Eric, too.  I'm like, I know there's no Derek Foynster.  He goes, it's all women in human resources.  I think he said there were, like, three women that worked there.  That's what it is.  There's no guys.  No.  Well, if he said human resources, too, that would be something.  He was saying human relations.  Like, oh, human relations.  You can't even get that right.  He tries to come off like he's so intelligent.  He's an adult.  Isn't that every interaction ever?  A human relation?  Yeah.  You fucking jack off.  By the way, he wouldn't mention the name of this show.  We'll certainly mention yours.  We're not afraid of people going to listen to you. 
[00:28:00]  It's WTKS.com.  In Orlando, he's 3 to 7 p.m.  Now, because he's so good, they fucking take out the first hour of his show on XM to play G. Gordon Liddy.  It was just a disaster, by the way.  I like G. Gordon Liddy, but oh, my God.  I'm doing that first again.  Oh, not you, Liddy.  Oh, so 4 to 7 on XM Channel 152.  Please, listen to him today and listen to how flustered he gets and the numbers.  888-978-1041. 
[00:28:30]  888-978-1041.  Please, assault this jerk off again.  I heard he lost his voice by the end of the show where it was all fucked up.  He was so pissed.  Supposedly, he was probably yelling during commercial breaks and stuff.  Begging for someone to help him.  He was so pissed because he obviously cannot carry a show without phone calls.  He was goofing on us for only taking three calls in the first hour and a half of our show yesterday.  Why is that a point you can goof on? 
[00:29:00]  Right.  Why?  Because we have the ability to do a program here that we can get on and do the show with the phones, without the phones.  Whatever comes across, we do our show.  You, on the other hand, are incapable of doing a show when our pests take you out of your element.  We've taken away your program.  Opie and Anthony's listeners are now programming your show.  They are deciding what you do, when you do it, when you go to commercials, when you take phone calls, what you talk about. 
[00:29:30]  It's done.  And it will continue.  Have fun with it.  Some of the other lies.  Opie and Anthony pay XM to be on.  Do we even have to acknowledge that?  That was a funny one.  He quit at 3.10 p.m. yesterday.  We don't pay a lot.  That's another thing.  You can't quit.  First of all, you don't get paid.  You don't work there.  You can't quit because your bosses, Clear Channel, have a deal, and you're being broadcast on there as long as your bosses tell you you're going to be broadcast on there. 
[00:30:00]  That's how it works.  You can't just leave.  And he's completely admitted, by the way.  And this is why, dude, I really, I really just want to fucking spit in your face because you're an admitted thief.  As a comedian, that makes me sick.  As an entertainer, that makes me sick.  You fucking local hack.  He said, yeah, that's the way it works.  And he admitted stealing the bit.  He's like, I've stolen from Howard.  I've stolen from a lot of people.  And I'm going to keep doing it.  Anything that makes this program more entertaining, you piece of shit. 
[00:30:30]  People are working.  And I'm going to talk about parallel thinking.  Everyone can talk about the media.  We're not deluded idiots.  Parallel thinking happens.  But you're admitting that you go out and steal something and use it as your own to entertain your listeners.  You're a fucking thief.  You're a disgraceful, one-market thief.  And you could tell how uncomfortable those people in his studio were getting.  Even the dumb broad next to him.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Because he's losing his mind.  He's admitting that he steals, you scumbag. 
[00:31:00]  You're everything that's wrong.  Everything.  Uncreative motherfucker.  Well, that's the new thing in commercial radio.  Now they all just admit, well, yeah, you know, you steal all the people's shit.  It's been going on for years.  It's going on for years.  It's okay.  No, it's not okay.  Dude, I riffed one day and one of stupid Nathaniel's lines flew out.  First thing I did the next day, you know, when we were talking about it, get on the air and go,  shit, that was Stan's line, not mine.  I just came out and we were talking about something.  Yeah.  You fucking disgusting thief.  He's a thief.  How do you fuck your wife knowing that you're a thief? 
[00:31:30]  How do you look her in the eyes knowing you did a wacky bit that you stole from Des Moines?  Jerk off.  Probably not even your cock.  You probably stole it from a DJ in Miami.  More lies, he says, did XM a favor by being on the air for them.  Not true.  It was a deal that XM has with Clear Channel.  Clear Channel is a tiny, tiny, tiny, really tiny shareholder with the company.  Yeah, I guess early on deals were made.  So they kind of, I guess the deal was that they get one channel to throw their programming on.  Yeah, that seems to be what the deal was. 
[00:32:00]  And that's all that is.  And I got a secret.  He was daring Eric to pull the plug.  I dare you to, he's so mad.  The big one, Elo wasn't really Elo.  Well, we got a $100,000 bet on that.  Prove it wasn't Eric Logan.  I will hand over $100,000, buddy boy.  Raise money so Greg Hughes and Elo can get a decent haircut.  I don't even get that one.  That's a haircut.  Never listened to the show, but he all of a sudden started goofing on Elo's hair. 
[00:32:30]  Those who listen to ONA collect welfare checks.  What else?  There's a whole list that they made on the message boards.  I'm going through real fast.  XM Radio can screw themselves.  Let's see.  Made fun of your Adam's apple.  Wow.  That's tough.  Because you remind him of his co-host.  That fucking awful tranny he sits next to.  With her big hands.  And her probably big delicious cock.  I take that as a compliment.  Because if you're studying my publicity photo over and over again to try to find something wrong with me. 
[00:33:00]  And the only thing you can come up with is my Adam's apple.  I think I'm doing okay.  My only problem with it is I didn't like the smile.  It didn't show your eyes well enough.  That's true.  Let's see.  What a disgusting.  Oh, this was great.  Someone called in his Chester and he said that ONA ripped off Chester because his cat's name is Chester.  Yeah.  Whenever the calls would come in.  And you just hear like.  All right.  Let's go to Chester. 
[00:33:30]  Chester, you're on the air.  Cunt.  All right.  Well, we can't have any of that going on.  Just dump out.  Dump out.  Yeah.  Dump out.  He sounded panicked a couple of times saying dump out.  He was getting very aggravated.  This will only get more and more fun for the listeners and for the pests.  And he's arrogant.  Now what's happened is he's trying to save face.  He's trying to prove that he's this big man.  I'm not going to be pushed around. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yes, you are.  Yeah.  Your show has been taken over.  It's stunk to begin with.  And now for us, it's fantastic.  For your listeners, it's going to be unlistenable.  And you're being embarrassed in your hometown.  You're being embarrassed.  And you're getting your face smacked with a dick.  How does that feel?  Three guys from New York are standing there with their cocks out.  And they're just doing this.  Smacking you.  Against your face.  And everybody's watching.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Massachusetts.  Steve, what's up?  All right.  Oh.  Dump out of that one.  Let's go to Schnit Dick from Wackbag.com. 
[00:34:30]  What's up, Schnit Dick?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I was just wondering.  The reason both of you guys have been talking about moving is because you've got to pay  your XM contracts.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's expensive.  It just gets annoying after a while knowing these guys are just blatantly lying out there.  It's everything I hate about the business.  These guys are real.  There's so many hacks in this business, I can't even tell you.  I can't even tell you.  And by the way, the good thing Bob got me was he got me coach airfare, but I still have  to pay for first class. 
[00:35:00]  Bob really worked out a nice deal.  Considering that we're paying to be on XM, he got me a good deal where I can pay  a little bit more to fly whenever we go to appearances.  Are you kidding?  No, it's fantastic.  Let's go to Ryan in Brooklyn.  Ryan?  Hey, it's Brian.  What's going on?  Oh, Brian.  What's up?  Brian.  At the end of his show yesterday, right, about 10 to 7, he said, am I a liar?  Well, maybe I am a liar.  So he's pretty much admitting that he's fucking telling bullshit lies the whole show.  It's very hard for him to lie and for people to not pick up on it. 
[00:35:30]  He's really bad, and it's too over the top.  Once again, I just want to admit, this show has so much freaking power, it's disgusting.  Our listeners now control another radio show, and they'll decide when they'll let up.  Yep.  They'll decide.  We'll leave it in their hands.  I love the fact that his message board's been down for two days.  Jason.  He can't even get onto his own message board.  That's great.  Jason, Chapel Hill, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey. 
[00:36:00]  Morning, Liddy.  Hey.  I just wanted to point out yesterday, I was listening to the guy the day before, how he  said it was a common business practice, that he doesn't want to say your names and spread  any publicity for you.  But every time he was trying to say something about you guys or other people he's ripped  off, he wasn't afraid to mention Howard or Neil or all these other guys in the business.  Yeah, that's a good point.  He was mentioning other names.  Well, we got our names out on his show, and that helps us in the long run, so. 
[00:36:30]  No worries.  I'm out of here.  All right.  Thank you, Jason.  All right.  So there's the update.  The little pussy ran to his bosses, and there's now like a law thing going on.  Don't play my...  Dude, his audio is priceless.  Dude, you're lucky, because that broad next to you, I know that's what sunk the ship,  is that he saw her just ripping her, and he knows how awful she is.  He has to know.  How does it feel to know that you're sitting next to an awful woman?  This is what you have to deal with, and that's your arsenal.  Yeah.  A fucking chick who's going to go, oh, dear, don't do that now. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Your go-to guy has a clit.  Yeah.  And not a funny bone in her body.  No.  And that's what sunk the ship.  You're absolutely right.  That's what made him run, run to the bosses to get a cease and desist out on us, was the  fact that we were playing her clips and laughing hysterically at how awful she is, and we would  have spent another hour today playing her awful clips.  It would have been a montage of just her inane comments. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Don't.  What was the one she...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  She just nods and agrees and offers nothing funny.  You guys remember this jingle that came in about a month ago?  In honor of that jingle, the same guy came up with a new one, using some of the wacky 
[00:38:00]  names that Mr. Phillips came up for us.  Listen to this.  That's great. 
[00:38:30]  Did he really call you Slim and Sam?  Oh, yes.  Can I come up with a name for them?  Yeah.  First, though, we need a little button pushed.  Why?  Oh, the C-word alert?  Yeah.  Let's hit that, because I have a funny little name.  C-word alert.  C-word alert.  I don't know where that thing is.  Well, we'd like to have it pushed, because I have a little wacky name for them.  A fun little wacky name, do you?  We like to warn the ladies out there that this word's coming from time to time. 
[00:39:00]  Warning.  Warning.  C-word alert.  C-word alert.  Warning.  Warning.  The name of his program should be the Jim and Cunt Show.  There you have it.  That's the name of your show.  Wacky.  Jim and Cunt was cute.  It is.  So there you have it.  If you want to know more about what went on yesterday, go to wackbag.com, opanthony.net.  Start at those two websites. 
[00:39:30]  Those guys did an unbelievable job.  Unbelievable.  Oh, yeah.  There were like 8,000 posts in one of the threads.  That was just one of the threads.  And viewed by 35,000 people.  But we have no listeners, right?  I'm so sick of commercial radio taking that little jab at us.  It's really funny.  Well, we're going to show you how many listeners we have from now on, you assholes.  I'm going to pop into the, as they call it, the war room tonight.  Again, because it was just, it was a pisser.  These guys out there are hysterically funny. 
[00:40:00]  They are just scumbags, too.  They just know how to beat the shit out of somebody.  And, yeah, we'll do it all again.  And then, unfortunately, he has the weekend off  and probably imagines that Monday they'll come back on  and everything will be cool.  Yeah, that's what he's hoping.  Monday we'll start a whole new week.  Yeah, and they'll move on and get bored with it or something.  No, it'll just keep going.  We'll talk about it less and less here on our show, 
[00:40:30]  is what will happen.  But it'll just continue.  Yeah, have fun.  I tried to get into that war room yesterday.  I just clicked hit the wrong button.  Like, you take me back to the sign-in page.  I was so annoyed.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was full, too.  The room was all full.  One of the rooms crashed.  Had to go to another room.  It's like all kinds of stuff going on behind the scenes.  A little Internet attacks going on.  It was Reed's Robe.  Yeah, his name.  I'm talking to him on the phone.  I go, yeah, pop into the room.  He goes, okay.  I go, what's your name going to be?  He goes, you'll know me when I pop in. 
[00:41:00]  So I look, and I see a name, Reed's Robe.  You son of a bitch.  I couldn't actually chat.  I was HIV.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was just big capital letters, HIV.  Well, it's good that we kind of stray away from the theme of the show.  By the lights.  Jesus Christ.  Let's go, thanks.  Steve called back.  Steve from Massachusetts.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  How's it going?  All right, Steve.  I'd like to apologize to everybody because I was a Nancy boy.  He kept on making fun of me.  Because basically when I called up, it picks up right on live air so he can embarrass you. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  That's basically what was happening.  So I just apologize to everybody.  I sound like a fag.  What were you, the guy that was like, I want to talk to those guys?  No, I want to talk to this fool.  Oh, you come across like a douchebag.  There are a couple of listeners that just don't get it, and they call up, and he picks up the phone, and you're on the air.  He's like, let me talk to them guys.  Who do you want to talk to?  I want to talk to that guy.  It's my fault, Steve.  If you guys want to rag on me, shit on me, go ahead. 
[00:42:00]  No, just call back today.  I'll leave for a minute, you know?  Call back today.  Learn from your mistakes, sir.  And smash his face.  Make sure you're on the air, though.  He's as broad as a screener.  Yeah.  Of course he does.  And the reality is he can't do a show without going to the phones.  And you'll hear it, because maybe he'll do a whole show today without one phone call.  Listen how awful it is.  He's a one-market sensation.  You know what, he talks about you guys giving him an hour and a half.  Yeah.  He spent eight hours talking about you guys.  It's been eight hours so far in two days. 
[00:42:30]  He's dedicated two entire programs.  Look at what we did yesterday.  We spent a lot of time at the beginning of the show talking about the situation.  But then we moved on and did a show.  We did our own show yesterday.  We had a lot of fun, a lot of things we talked about and got to.  Andrew reading movie lines, by the way.  I heard that in the replay.  Oh, my God.  At the end of the show where it just cuts him off because he took too long.  Yeah.  Hysterical.  That was really good.  And this guy just can't do the show.  He spent eight hours in two days talking about this. 
[00:43:00]  And today, again.  They're going to do little games today.  I guarantee you they're going to probably call a few of their own callers.  They're going to do something wacky.  They're going to try.  But the bottom line is it's our pests controlling your program.  That's it.  Whether they get on the air or not, whether they tie up your phones and you don't take  calls, whether you have to show prep with some really lousy material so you don't have  to use the phones.  Whatever you have to do, you're doing because our pests are running your show.  It's on Prep Burger right now looking for a little something to get them through the 
[00:43:30]  day.  Why don't you just go on Prep Burger and steal something from somewhere else, you disgraceful  thief.  You scumbag thief.  Just wait for when the gay literature starts showing up.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  They tend to sign people up for things and really despicable.  I really hope you don't have a pool yet because you're getting one.  Did you see how many...  I scratched myself.  Did you see how many people sent pizza and stuff to their... 
[00:44:00]  They were doing that on the message board.  It's like, oh, they sent all kinds of food to the studio and they're just pests.  Total pests.  What they really ought to do, they ought to order a funny woman and have her shipped  over there.  Maybe she can help rescue that fucking abortion of a show he has.  It is hard.  You know what he is?  Here's what he is.  Dude, you're a cornball.  You're a cornball.  That's what he is.  He's a cornball.  You can't deal with this.  We're not...  We're funnier. 
[00:44:30]  We're more clever.  We're sarcastic.  How are you sarcastic?  Yeah, I heard none of that.  You want to hear sarcasm?  Here it is.  That chick's really funny.  That's sarcastic.  Like, your show blows.  You're not a funny guy.  This guy seems to think just because he's saying something that it's true.  You're not funny.  You're not sarcastic.  You're not cutting edge.  You're not witty.  You're not quick.  You're not intelligent.  You're not...  He says all these things, but then you see no examples of it during his show. 
[00:45:00]  You're not funny.  And Jim, that's a great word.  Cornball.  It's not a dirty word.  It's not a...  But it's exactly what this guy is.  A cornball.  Oof.  On the replay, I laughed.  I LOL'd in the car late last night driving home when you called.  You said he was done in old, fogey fashion.  Old fogey.  That's exactly who he is.  You come off as an old fogey trying to be hip, relevant, funny, cutting edge, and it just 
[00:45:30]  isn't working, fella.  It just isn't working.  And I guarantee you he is successful because he's probably just something people have become  comfortable with because they drive, and oh, here he is again, and that's it.  That's what happens in these small market wonders, like Opa's saying.  They're there for so long, they become a fixture.  It's like it's something that you're just used to being there.  It's there.  So you put it on, kind of background sound, it's a familiar voice kind of thing. 
[00:46:00]  It's not because of anything funny or clever or interesting.  There's no real passion.  No.  It's just what it is.  It's this cornball old hack sitting there thinking he's being clever.  Admitting he's a thief to his listeners.  I mean, you're telling your listeners that you've ripped shit off, and it's like you're  disgraceful enough to do it.  And then to sit there and just tell your listeners, A, that you make a lot of money, and that  you steal, you are just an arrogant, unfunny jerk-off. 
[00:46:30]  That's what you are.  And now, us and our listeners control your show.  That's right.  I'm actually, Voss is doing a gig, I think, soon in Florida.  I might have him booked on that show to do a little promotion.  I'll make my decision.  That'll be nice.  On who I want on that program.  Right.  Jimmy's booking the show.  That's right.  I couldn't do any worse job of guest booking than some people in life have done.  So in case the pests are wondering, don't let up.  Yeah, just do not let up on this one.  As a matter of fact, take it to the next level. 
[00:47:00]  That's right.  Just pound this guy.  That's right.  Relentless.  Don't play by his rules, because he always puts these rules for it that you're not supposed  to say the name of the show, no cursing, answer his questions, just do not even acknowledge  his rules.  It's all about tying up his phones, eating up his delay, and preventing him from doing  the show he wants to do on a daily basis.  You are the bosses.  Yep.  You run his show.  You are the bosses.  You're a large group of program directors, so enjoy being the bosses. 
[00:47:30]  This is 1-888-978-1041, 3-7 East Coast time, but only 4-7 East Coast time on XM 152, because  the hottest show on XM is being preempted by G. Gordon Liddy.  How bad are you doing when you're an edgy drive-time talk show, and they're playing G. Gordon  Liddy?  I think this would be a good time to promote the official opiate Anthony Pest t-shirts.  Yes.  Proudly wear the Pest t-shirts. 
[00:48:00]  I think this is pretty much the last day to pre-order your Pest t-shirts.  For you fat fucks out there.  Basically, that's what it comes down to.  If you're one of those unusual sizes, you can get a Pest t-shirt.  Once they're made available to the public, then you just pick up, what do you get, the  large?  The large, extra large.  That's about it.  You email my brother, the opiate Anthony Pest t-shirts.  His email address is doctor, you can spell out doctor, drduck, D-U-K, at AOL.com  for your official opiate Anthony Pest t-shirts.  I'd like to ask old Doc Duck. 
[00:48:30]  I want to get a regular, oh, and I, the spread the virus shirts I want.  I haven't seen them in a while.  I might be out on Long Island this weekend.  I'll bring some shirts by.  How's that?  Yeah.  All right?  Poor I just had to wait for a shirt and buy one.  I want a shirt.  But the Pest t-shirts, they're becoming pretty popular as well.  And you can email my brother, drduck, D-U-K, at AOL.com.  Spell out doctor.  All right?  We're going to take a break, and we're going to do a real radio show.  Ooh.  We've got to talk about the subway thing.  It's just absolutely amazing.  It's on the front page of every paper, and it's got Anthony just in a rage. 
[00:49:00]  We'll get into that next.  Also today, we have new news teasers, one of my favorite bits on the new program.  Love this bit.  They're also one of mine.  Huh?  They're also one of my favorites, Opie.  Fuck off and die.  I hate you.  They're fighting again.  Oh, now you two.  Don't go down that road.  I'll be her all day.  Now you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, stop.  Oh, gosh.  Shut up.  Mommy and Daddy are fighting.  Oh, now. 
[00:49:30]  That guy that, he had a guy call up, and the guy was like,  Hey, Jim, I know for a fact that Heckle and Jekyll, I won't say their name,  Um, they hate each other.  They hate each other.  Oh, yeah, you know for a fact, uh, uh, uh, uh, how'd you find this out?  Uh, I just know.  Like, he didn't even sit and think it out for two seconds and come up with maybe a backstory  as to how he found out we hate each other? 
[00:50:00]  Like, there was nothing there, and then he goes,  Well, I know someone that knew an intern.  Like, oh, oh, okay.  And then everybody on the message board started going,  Oh, fucking Ricky.  Fucking Ricky.  Good old Ricky.  All right, why don't we take our first break,  and we'll, uh, continue.  We got some good stuff on that.  Right.  Like sand through the hourglass,  so is the ordinary virus.  On your birthday, when you get to talk to every member of Black Sabbath,  you really have a wonderful, wonderful birthday. 
[00:50:30]  That's a perfect birthday.  Oh, my goodness.  And you were saying how you hate birthdays yesterday.  That was the best birthday I've ever had.  The bestest birthday ever for Jimmy.  Bruce Dickinson, Iron Maiden, got him.  I got everybody I wanted.  It was fantastic.  Wow.  I annoyed Geezer, and I annoyed I-Omi.  You did?  Geezer's getting, they walk in, they're doing this,  they're doing this, they're doing this,  Oz Feast, which is a quick appearance backstage with 20 fans.  And, of course, I'm back there.  And they're getting, they come back to the backstage area,  but they're going to go on the tour bus first. 
[00:51:00]  So I panic and run over, I'm like,  Oh, Geezer?  Oh, because you think they're leaving?  Yeah.  And he turns around and looks at me.  Oh, you're over-eager douche.  He turns around and looks at me,  and then just kind of, like, walked onto the bus.  I thought, fuck.  I kind of rushed it, okay.  So then they come off the bus,  they're going to come over to the signing,  and I walk over.  I go, hey, guys.  And the tour manager goes,  Oh, just be patient, man.  You'll get it.  Oh, no.  Oh, you were the impotent guy.  And then I wait a couple minutes.  Oh, how embarrassing to do it.  And then I wait a couple of more minutes.  And I see I-Omi there.  I'm like, hey, Tony, 
[00:51:30]  I'm going to be interviewing you next week for XM.  Okay.  Okay, yeah.  And I'm like,  I thought I'd get a picture with you.  And he goes,  well, I think we're doing this thing.  And then they turn around  and go back out of the bus  to do an interview with Cousin Ed.  So I'm like, fuck.  And then they finally come out off the bus again.  Oh, you over-eager little shit.  I was awful.  They come off the bus.  They go to where the fans,  they make the fans all sit at the table.  I'd have had security remove you by that,  but I'd have looked out of the bus window and go,  see that little fuck?  He is so annoying.  Get him out of here.  Well, they come out, 
[00:52:00]  and now all the fans are shooting.  They're like,  everybody has to sit down and be cool.  And so Tony is standing there signing an autograph,  and I just walk up and go,  oh, hey, man,  do you think I can get a picture with you  because I'm on the station?  He goes, oh, you again.  He didn't.  He didn't say, oh, you again.  He said he did.  You are so embarrassing.  You're the worst.  Oh, you again.  You again.  Oh, God.  That is horrible.  I had this laminate,  and I was too embarrassed.  I asked Deezer and Tony to sign it  because I annoyed all of them.  I had this guy, Monkey,  who works at the... 
[00:52:30]  Whitey?  Yeah, he's great.  So I fucking just begged him  to get the Messiah.  Come on, dude,  just walk up to him.  I'm like,  I'm wondering how many guys  are the Messiah at night.  Oh, you embarrassment.  Dude, oh, you again.  I'm really annoyed.  I'm not going to see him next week.  Just be patient.  Like the over-eager,  retarded kid  that wants to go on the ride,  and they're like,  no, no, no,  and you haven't done  what you have to do yet,  and they're just tugging at you.  I want to go.

Some of you will be joining us  and the rest  go fuck yourselves.  Die along with the business.  Let commercial radio  just cut your balls off.  Oh, we'll save a few people

No chicks whatsoever.  Oh, come on now.  We all love women  on this program  We just don't love  women on the radio.  Hey, not now.  Don't go down that road.  Dude, I'm hurt today.  That's it.  Like it or not.  Unfunny cutlet lap. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Chemistry  from Whackbag, of course.  I hate to admit it  but I've made the transformation.  I've morphed from a listener  to a pest.  Thanks, Jim Phillips.  That's right.  People are just embracing this.  Loving it.  Having fun with it.  And he's done.  And this is just  going to crush him.  I have a feeling  your co-host goes  to tie her shoes  and the entire studio  smells like squid.  How does that feel?  Stupid. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, you really have freedom  to be yourself  and do what you want  when there's just a chick  sitting around  all day long.  You really have that  freedom to talk  to another guy  like a guy  like guys talk  and crack those jokes  that really make people laugh  without  oh god  now guys  well well  hey hey now  yeah because you want  that thrown in  because someone told you  that's what you needed  someone told you 
[00:55:30]  that's what radio's about  some fucking idiot  told you  you need a woman  on your show  to balance out things  and you ate it up  and there she sits  wrecking your already  lame ass show.  Sally in Illinois  what's up Sally?  Hi.  I'm not one of those girls  that does that  I can say cunt  with the rest of them  but I'm wondering  if you're one of those  human laugh tracks  like the woman  that's on with this gym guy  what do you aspire to be  at the pinnacle  of your career?  Robin? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah that seems to be  what they really are  looking to be  is like Robin Quivers  and when you look at it  down the road  look what happened  to Ed McMahon  when Johnny retired  he didn't get to be  the head of the show  he's Al's sidekick now.  What she does is this  she just  it's like  it's fake  awful fake laughing  it's just  it's become a pattern  almost like a nod  yeah yeah yeah  what is she going to say  she just contributes nothing  she's salt and pepper  oh god 
[00:56:30]  it's annoying  it's like a bug  flying around your ears  and you keep  swatting at it  yeah exactly  a bug with tranny hands  thank you Sally  big meaty mitts  Jazz in DC  what's up Jazz  hey what's up fellas  hey man  love the show  hey sexy dick  hi mister  I was listening to  this shit dick yesterday  and during his  fucking commercial break  they play commercials  for you guys  I know  that is so god damn funny  they threw together  threw together 
[00:57:00]  a promo  that  apparently it was us  ragging on him  and it played during  his show  approved by the fake  ELO by the way  yeah the fake ELO  wow that fake ELO  has a lot of power  that he can get that  promo played  certainly does  imagine what the real  ELO could do  right  plug it out fellas  alright  we're not  I'm not saying that  ELO shouldn't be  a fake ELO  how that guy's in charge  is beyond me  no  but he is in charge  and it is indeed him  and he sent me a ton 
[00:57:30]  of email overnight  because the past  the past  you know  it's got to the point  some of them  don't take our word  either  they do their own  fact checking  that's what makes  them more dangerous  so then they're  emailing Eric Logan  like crazy  like were you the one  that was on  the Opie and Anthony  show today  yeah  they're questioning him  I should print up  some of these emails  they're hilarious  they were coming in  all night long  all morning long  couple of people  on the message board  and chat rooms  and stuff  were questioning  me also saying  hey well  was it really ELO 
[00:58:00]  and that's when I wrote  if it wasn't ELO  I will suck on  Sandy Kane's  Twado  I will suck on it  and that's when  everyone just went  okay  obviously it was really ELO  and you know how  tied I am with money  I got a $100,000 bet  100 grand  Mr. Phillips  if he could prove  that that wasn't  Eric Logan on our show  I am the winner  I would have believed  that it wasn't Eric Logan  if you said look  I'll put five bucks  down on it  I would have been like  Jesus it's him  alright 
[00:58:30]  this came in overnight  supposedly  I want to try  to defend myself  but I'm going to do  a horrible job with it  Sean O  from Mineola  sent this in  overnight Anthony  the listeners  sending in stuff  every single day  at this point  very aggressive  with helping out  the program  by the way  we haven't mentioned  in a while  if you're sending  audio to the program  please send it  directly to Steve  Steve is in charge 
[00:59:00]  of all the audio  on this program  Steve at  foundrymusic.com  okay  but Sean O  from Mineola  sent this in  you know  it must frustrate  the shit  out of some  of these listeners  that are very  creative  funny  they have a talent  for throwing  this stuff together  that an ass wipe  like Jim Phillips  has a radio show  and these people  you know  don't  that's what life's  all about  I think the listeners  have proven themselves  to the point that  I think we need  to give them  an hour or two  on this channel  somehow  that would be 
[00:59:30]  a fun thing  to do  basically a show  called the listeners  of Opie and Anthony  and it's just  their stuff  throw them on the channel  for an hour  yeah we got to  figure it out  we're going to  start building out  this channel  I think in September  but I think  on the weekend  or something  you got to give  these guys  an hour or two  now  you just have to  I'm sit there  with somebody  who can run  equipment  right  we'll figure it out  but basically  you know  you guys send  your stuff in  whether it's  you just babbling  with your buddies  or doing pranks  on the street  or song parodies  whatever 
[01:00:00]  we'll collect it all  and we'll make it  into a show  and we'll just  call it the listeners  of Opie and Anthony  listeners hour  or we'll come up  with a better name  whatever  the pest hour  something  but I think we need  to make that happen now  some of them  have shown themselves  to be worthy  I was going to say  they've proven themselves  that they are  they are very creative people  and some have shown  themselves to be  construction workers  yeah just inept boobs  awful with no senses  of humor  how does any  it's horrible  you almost blew out  with humor  senses of humor  I can't fucking talk today 
[01:00:30]  I was up much too late  last night  I really  I really genuinely laugh  listening to those calls  those guys really  they're funny people  out there man  it's just great  to kind of like  bring them in  and just let them  do what they do  which is just  fucking fuck with people  let's go to John  in Long Island  John  I just want to let you know  in between the long  commercial breaks  that Howard takes  he's playing the  retarded period girl  old time audio  tell him Fred  the first  the chick that has  the  is getting her  period for the first time  yeah the little 
[01:01:00]  retarded chick  or something  that's a quickie  we did that  at least three or four  months ago  by the way  Eric  Eric come in here  is Eric around  why  no no no reason  only because  when I asked  for the daily news  an hour and  eight minutes ago  and he said that  Travis was on his way  did Travis die  on the way in here  with my daily news  anyway let me get back  to Sean O  from Mineola  you are just a fuck  I just I like to  have my papers  I know you guys  have your copies  laid out  so if I want to  read something  I want to just  flip through it  right  and I don't know 
[01:01:30]  why it's so hard  to get a copy  of the daily news  we'll get to the subway  ha ha  I have a daily news  I know  and you should  you're an informed  gentleman  thank you  Sean O  from Mineola  oh right  speaking of  creative listeners  I would love to  defend myself  but I just can't  he sent this in  overnight  it's titled  Opie's Flub Mix  and he swears  this is one day's  worth of me  stammering  one day  he got all this 
[01:02:00]  audio  from one  lousy  day  oh boy  and threw this  together  it's called  the Opie  Flub Mix  right  if you really  want to get  into this  oh yeah  we're sorry  it was stupid  it was morally wrong  bar  our  because I'm  the Opie and Anthony show  vicious  I don't  I'm on the  that's bad  word 
[01:02:30]  I would have never  try again  chinks  niggers  so I give  the  incidents  you know  show with you  with you guys  we understand  well not because  it's good  it's  and  and  own the  own the  or well  I mean  we were just  what I want to say  was  so I  shut up  I mean  you know  it's  you know you're a hack  you gotta put some  headphones on  that's 
[01:03:00]  that's what  radio is all about  hey  whoa  I like  I like  what they had  I have  this  this  hey hey  how the  people  uh  he's  I don't know  oh yeah  you know you're a  fucking mumbling  stuttering  you know that  that was  great  I'm going to 
[01:03:30]  compliment his own  bit at the end  you  did  I am  sad right now  did you hear that  at the end of the bit  no I was too busy  enjoying the  Ozzy and Anthony show  very funny  very good  Sean O  from Mineola  send in another one  oh you stink  very funny  wow  very good  very good  let's go to Matt  in Philly  Matt what's up  hey what's going on  fellas  hey Matt  yo Opie  are you betting  a hundred grand candy bar 
[01:04:00]  or are you really  trying to do some cash  a hundred  thousand  dollars  wow  and of course  he won't acknowledge it  or he'll  or he'll say  it's a dumb radio  you know  bid or whatever  but trust me  a hundred thousand  dollars if he can prove  that was  not Eric Logan  on our show yesterday  hey Jimmy  I'm going to see you  this weekend  up in Cleveland  oh thank you  I'll be there  tomorrow night  at the Odeon  you said Jimmy though  sir I'm the only  Jimmy that's going to be  in Cleveland  all right 
[01:04:30]  and then he hung up  on you Jimmy  that was rude  and mean spirited  it was very  well here's the story  of the day  that has Anthony  completely  yeah  pissed off  I think all of us  pissed off  hmm  you got a little  sound clip  yeah I got like  five clips  all right  the police commissioner  promises the searches  yeah see this is  there's no setup here  though  I knew that was  going to happen 
[01:05:00]  that's okay though  we got audio to help  us with the story here  well in England  Anthony go ahead  in jolly old England  in London  yesterday  of course you've heard  the news  more bombings  but apparently  the detonators  went off  and the bombs  didn't  there were  four bombs planted  they said three more  on subways  one on a bus  just like  two weeks ago  and they heard  a popping noise  somebody said  it sounded like  a balloon popping  or a champagne cork  going off  and  apparently 
[01:05:30]  they either  screwed up  putting the detonator  on the explosives  or the explosives  were past their shelf life  did you know  they had a shelf life  or by transporting them  they screwed it up  but I would think  if all of them  screwed up  it would have to  probably be  the explosives  material just got old  and went bad  and it didn't blow up  lucky for the people  in the subways  and the buses  but  when you really  think about it  even though 
[01:06:00]  they didn't blow up  just the fact that  London right now  is under a lockdown  as far as  their mass transit  goes  probably more security  in a mass transit  system in London  than anywhere in the world  right now  because of what  happened two weeks ago  and they still got  four bombs in  they still got  it was just  luck that these  things didn't go off  and kill more people  and they're looking  they're looking more  than anyone in the world  and they still got in  and now 
[01:06:30]  in New York City  they are going to  start random searches  of people's bags  as they get on the subway  I think the reason  that these  bags got in  again in London  and the reason  why these  random searches  won't help  is because  they have said  they've gone on the news  and said  the police commissioner  got on and said  we will not  be profiling  for race  during these searches 
[01:07:00]  when I heard that  you almost assumed  that that was going  to happen  but you didn't want  the guy coming out  and just saying it  you want the cops  out there  and going  yeah they're  random searches  but then  looking at people  face it  it's young  Middle Eastern men  that's who is  if someone's going  to blow up the subway  it's going to be  young Middle Eastern men  there is no reason 
[01:07:30]  to check  a black woman's  pocketbook  there's no reason  to check a white woman  with a stroller  going on with her baby  there's no reason  a white guy  in a suit  coming home  from the office  there is no reason  to check these people  Middle Eastern  young men  search them  but  we can't  it's against  it's against the law  I guarantee though  behind closed doors  that's exactly  what they've been told  to look for  but they can't 
[01:08:00]  but you know  then they have to  go out in public  and do these press  conferences  and say no  no it'll be random  dude the news  is watching  the second they see  two Middle Eastern men  searched in a row  you're going to see  the stories  are they profiling  in the subways  that's what you're  going to see  they should come out  and say  yes  we are profiling  based on  what has been  going on in the world  why would you search  a white woman  with a carriage  a black woman 
[01:08:30]  with her pocketbook  why would you  search these people  when no bombings  have been carried out  by them  when none of these  bombings by Al-Qaeda  have been carried out  by these people  I don't even mind  certain white males  because maybe  they're going to  eventually start  bringing in Chechnyans  Muslims are the real problem  not even Middle Eastern guys  as much as Muslims  because even when they're  in the Philippines  or when they're in Indonesia  they're not necessarily  Middle Eastern looking guys  but it's the religion  that's the problem  but here they're almost  99 if not all 
[01:09:00]  Middle Eastern men  and in London  I mean all the videos  they got of the people  the people they've researched  it's all Middle Eastern  of course they could  recruit somebody  a white guy  but the odds are  we know who's doing this  we know who's going  to be doing this  if it happened  it wasn't you know  a white guy in a suit  it wasn't somebody  from the Philippines  flying those planes  these are Middle Eastern men  fanatics  lunatics  that's who should be  being searched  you're wasting time 
[01:09:30]  and resources  looking at other races  and religions  it's wasting time  well Bloomberg is a liberal  anyway  and he just  became a Republican  because he wanted  to become the mayor  there's a great  great editorial  called Random Idiocy  it's in the post today  by a woman named  Michelle Malkin  and it's just listing  all these things  about Middle Eastern men  and the bottom line  is look  I know most of you guys  are fine  we know that  but the bottom line  is unfortunately  you are using this  assimilating into this 
[01:10:00]  society  like the guy in London  one of them  was a school teacher  yeah  so don't say  how can you look  at all of us  like that  when the people  that are doing this  are people  that have assimilated  into society comfortably  I'm sorry  I don't want to hear  the Japanese  internment camp bullshit  they were citizens  who were harassed  when it was a military  attack  they never should have  been harassed  because there was no  evidence  they were infiltrating  and trying to  you understand  and trying to  murder Americans  as citizens  that's what these  guys are doing  they decided to  play the game  that way  tough shit 
[01:10:30]  we have to  respond that way  why blame  the public  who just wants  to be safe  for something  that your own  people are doing  to you  this isn't  the public  turning around  and all of a sudden  becoming racist  and profiling  this is your people  Middle Eastern men  of your religion  Muslim  committing crimes  that are making  people take a  closer look at you  your people  and your religion  that's what it is  and that's where  we should be looking  and this isn't 
[01:11:00]  because they're  afraid it's going  to be a condemnation  of everybody  of Middle Eastern  descent  and every Muslim  it's not  I understand that  but you have to  look at the people  that are doing this  that's it  we know who is  committing these  bombings  civil libertarians  have no ability  to adjust  to this type of  a situation  they are obsessive  all or nothing  knee jerk  reaction  well a slippery  slope  fuck you  slippery slope  people use that  slippery slope 
[01:11:30]  dog shit argument  to take you  from one place  to another  when they can't  get there  any other  you understand  what I mean  it's an excuse  like what about this  you want to go  with slippery slope  how about this  let's not have jails  simply because  an innocent man  can be convicted  you want to talk  about slippery slope  let's not have jails  then  let's not have  any type of  law enforcement  because technically  that power  can be perverted  fucking slippery slope  argument is weak  yeah  alright we got the audio  from the police commissioner  here in New York City  let's go to that now  the police commissioner  promises the searches 
[01:12:00]  will be entirely random  certain number of people  will be checked  it won't be done on a  certainly no  racial profiling  will be allowed  against our policies  why  did you hear that  certainly like  hey hey  no certainly  it will not  like making an issue  like this is the most  important part of it  the most important part  of this search  isn't protecting  people  from the police  searching them  based on race  it's protecting  the people  trying to go to work  and come home 
[01:12:30]  and remain in one piece  that's what the  important part of this is  take the people  that are doing it  use it as profile  profile  why is profiling  such a bad word  why is profiling  such a bad thing  to take  profiling is used  everywhere  you take something  you look at the  track record  you look at past  performance  it's used in everything  and you base  what you do in the  future  on that record  that's profiling  people use it  in the stock market 
[01:13:00]  they use it  everywhere  why can't it be used  to protect people  same ideology  that says profiling  is bad  are the same  ideology  that want you  admitted to a college  based on your race  it is a disgusting  double standard  a disgusting  inconsistent hypocrisy  it's really  really irritating  man  so now  we got a bunch  of cops doing this  it's costing the city  a lot of money  a lot of time  it's there  to make us  safer  make us feel safer  I don't know  but 
[01:13:30]  it's not  going to do  what it should be doing  which is weeding out  and really  putting the fear  in the people  that might do this  alright we got more audio  here let's go to the next clip  I think  that's going to be  really tough  there's a lot of people  in the station  and during the rush hour  it's going to delay  a lot of people  if you have nothing  in your bag  you have nothing  to fear  yeah what if they  find something else  in the bag  now that's another issue  what if all of a sudden  you're some dude  with like an eight ball  or something  you got some coke 
[01:14:00]  I have no idea  that's what they're doing  now technically  they're not allowed  to arrest you  I mean they're just  I guess looking  for explosives  what if you have  something illegal  in there  a bag of pots  on top of your  in your backpack  and the cop looks through  finds a big bag of weed  random stops  I mean I don't know  the law that well  but random DWI stops  I mean if they see  they're stopping  for seatbelts  or whatever  if they see something else  they are allowed  to arrest you  something laying out  there during  if a cop pokes 
[01:14:30]  his head in your car  and you have  a bag of weed  on the seat  obviously  he can arrest you  he cannot look  in your glove compartment  for no reason  and pull weed out  and arrest you  this is I guess  fourth amendment issue  you can't just  pull someone aside  and look through  their bags  and if you find  something  arrest them on that  this is more  a security issue  this isn't a  they're trying to  present this as not  an illegal search thing 
[01:15:00]  they're presenting  this as a security issue  like when you go  into a concert  you're being searched  you're being searched  for something  that you might  hurt somebody  with inside  but if they find pot  and I don't know  what they  they can't arrest you  for it  and I think  this is the same  situation  anybody that can't  see the logic  behind these searches  if there's any  civil libertarians  out there  and I don't want  to hear  what's next  your computers  at home  no  jerk offs  no  when it comes  to that  we will all 
[01:15:30]  be disgusted  but when people  are setting bombs  off because  they're bringing  backpacks on  subways  and you say  well let's start  checking backpacks  because they're  doing this  and I love the  excuse people use  for Islam  and they say  well it's poverty  they play on poverty  they give these  people hope  they are recruiting  middle class  people who are  not poor  they're educated  it's not about  them being stupid  it's not about  them being poor  they are  religious fanatics  businessmen  a lot of businessmen  a lot of money  a lot of them  that's why we lump  them all into the  same category  and the reason 
[01:16:00]  Islam is always  brought up  is because  Bin Laden  associated  themselves  we've got the  police commissioner  on TV right now  certainly won't be  all the time  but you'll see it  in I think  significant locations  some of our  larger locations  I noticed right  after Madrid  you sent people  over there  right away  to look at  what happened  I imagine  you did the same  thing with London  after 7-7  is anything  your guys  your people  your investigators  over there  is anything  there's telling  you about  what they're  seeing in London  prompting  what we're  seeing here  in New York  no by the way  the British  have been  very open  with us 
[01:16:30]  they've been  terrific  we do have  someone right  there privy  to the ongoing  investigation  look at the  audio over his  shoulder  but there's  nothing specific  that's coming  out of London  that required  us to put  this procedure  in place  it's the same  stuff  police apparently  in London  shot and killed  I guess a  suspected bomber  in one of the  tubes  the Stockwell  tube station  yes  oh jolly good  stop then  no  I'll shoot you 
[01:17:00]  then  we got a  security expert  a little audio  from him  it's going to  create some  problems  because the  public is not  aware that this  is going to  happen  with a very  short announcement  no leaflets  no bumplets  has been given  out to prepare  the people  they pat him  down  he smuggled  gold teeth  out of Germany  in 1940  creep  more of the  security expert  I won't have  enough people  to detain  and what  happens if I  turn around  and decide  not to  be searched  and walk out  will they run  after me 
[01:17:30]  will they  challenge me  I mean we're  going to have  confrontations  every day  that's a great  point now  let's say  there is  somebody that  fits the  profile  they got  a backpack  the cops  come up to  them and  go I want  to search  you  what they're  saying is  if you  deny  the search  you'll be  turned away  from the subway  now you turn  away and say  I don't want  to be searched  what will  the cops  do  if they  if this  guy kind  of fits  the bill  he's got  a backpack  he doesn't  want to be  searched  now what  do you do  let him 
[01:18:00]  just go up  into the  streets  let him  find another  subway  your instincts  would be  let me  check this  guy  further  this  will  present  a problem  what will  happen is  there's a few  pukey  I don't want to say  college students  but a few  pukes  will purposefully  walk away  just to have  this self-righteous  indignation  I'm not going to be  searched  man  and when the cops  come after them  they won't have  anything on them  I could see a guy  with drugs 
[01:18:30]  turning around  the only thing  they should do  is if you have  a weapon  some type of  a deadly weapon  well that would be  let's say an illegal  gun in there  that's something  that can be used  on the subway  by a terrorist  just start  randomly shooting  in the subway  so that I could see  then there's  some marginal  calls  you know  what if they  find pepper spray  nah leave it alone  drugs leave it alone  as much as you want  to arrest a guy  for drugs  that's not what  you're there for  you're not there  to search a guy  for an eight ball  or for a putt  yeah  they also  interviewed the news  this big haired 
[01:19:00]  passenger  yeah that guy  we were all laughing  in the office  they found some guy  with the hugest  head of hair  it was unbelievable  how much hair  this guy had  puffy head of  it looked like  a big pile of  black dog shit  on his head  it was great  it was hilarious  this is what he had to say  I guess that's a good idea  considering what's going on  in London  I mean  I guess you can't  be too safe  so  and you're not going to  find it a violation  of your privacy  that's questionable  I guess 
[01:19:30]  so long as there's  no racial profiling  going on  however  it could be pretty hard  to monitor that  I suppose  exactly  just invite them in  and sit on a plane  next to them  don't even search  getting on planes  how about that  we welcome them in  and they just sit on a plane  and do what they want  you fucking dummies  how about that  let's go to Mike  in Pennsylvania  Mike what's up  hey what's up  what's up Mike  hey I totally agree 
[01:20:00]  with you guys  on the profiling thing  it seems like a real  no brainer  it's not PC  but it is the right  thing to do  yes  but I do  there is one small problem  okay  you guys there  yeah  let's go  the problem is  one of the four  original bombers  was a black guy  from Jamaica  again  that's what I was saying  about the Chechnians  you're going to have that  you have to go with  the percentages though  right  that's what I'm saying  99%  of course we know  it could be somebody else  it could be a black guy 
[01:20:30]  it could be again  a white guy from Chechnya  who looks like I do  believe me  we know that  but you've got to  play the odds  you've got to look  for your best chances  of finding these people  and the best chance  is it's going to be  a young Middle Eastern man  that's it  Pete in Florida  what's up Pete  hey guys  I'm actually  first of all  I love the show  just got XM  second of all  I'm in law school  right now  and there's a rule  called the rule  of plain view  this goes in hand  with what you guys  were talking about  if a cop pulls you  over for something  and he sees  say an empty 
[01:21:00]  beer container  underneath your seat  he can write you  a ticket for  open container  or if he's  searching your house  if he comes to your house  on a domestic violence call  and he sees a  a bag of weed  he can arrest you  for that  it's called  the rule of plain view  he can't  openly search  without a warrant  but if he sees it  with his own eyes  then yeah  you can definitely  get in trouble  punch it out  alright  and I think  one thing that's key  is that when  searches are done  like this  there has to be  a certain  amount of dignity  and respect  you can't just  alright give me the bag 
[01:21:30]  if you're searching  people  I mean most people  will understand  why you're doing it  I mean the bottom line  is I get stopped  every time I get on a plane  I look like a fucking  just a weirdo  if you're searching people  like after Oklahoma  if they were pulling me over  and searching me  I don't understand it  because it was  a bunch of white guys  with crew cuts  who were fanatics  as long as you do it  with respect  and you're not  a scumbag to the people  because you know  almost every person  you're searching  in this country  is going to be fine  yeah  hey I agree with Rich  in New York  by the way  I think I made this point  a little earlier  go ahead Rich  hey what's going on  I definitely agree  with pretty much 
[01:22:00]  everything you guys  are saying  well you better  damn it  yeah for Pete's sake  oh now  guys  do you guys  think that maybe  since they're going  to start this  they're just trying  to pay the media  a little lip service  before these civil rights  groups can step up  and start screaming  profiling  that they're just  kind of saying  right up front  we're not going to do it  but in the back  of their minds  they know exactly  who it is  that they're going  to go after  but just kind of  trying to head off  it's very hard  to keep that  a secret though  especially when you  have the media  and you have these 
[01:22:30]  groups that are  just going to be  like vultures  hanging over  these people  watching them  waiting  for a Middle Eastern  man to be searched  and then  you know  hey look at this  look what we saw  you know  our cameras  caught this police  officer searching  only Arab men  they're just  waiting  to spring  they do have to say  that though  I mean you know  let's be honest  in this world  you can't just  come out and  just tell the truth  unfortunately  the thing that's  disgusting  is that you  can't just be  honest about it  yeah  alright thank you sir  yeah that is 
[01:23:00]  disgusting  because I'd feel  a lot safer  if they were just  profiling  that's for sure  and you know  something  people would say  well you wouldn't  feel that way  if you were  a Middle Eastern  man  oh well  tough shit  yeah  sorry  my people  aren't the ones  blowing things up  exactly  our culture  isn't saying  that mothers  aren't proud  of their sons  when they  strap a bomb  to themselves  and kill a bus  full of children  and maybe  these good Muslims  maybe if these  real good Muslims  that are good  members of society 
[01:23:30]  that everyone  keeps talking about  showed a little  fucking outrage  at what these  animals were doing  and didn't just  remain silent  and quietly  praise these  assholes  well perhaps  you'd be treated  a little better  but not a peep  out of these  sons of bitches  that's why  there's a great  picture in the  paper by the way  oh yeah  with the cop  looking at that  lady  there's a Middle  Eastern woman  walking by  in England  she's got a  stroller  and a fully  armed cop  with a  dog  and he's got  his head turned  and he's looking  at her like  what's in the 
[01:24:00]  stroller  what's in the  stroller pig  you know  and that's kind of  what it's turning  into  that picture  says a lot  right there  show a little  you know  speak out  speak out  again  have an entire  mosque  come out  and all their  congregation  come out  against this  be very vocal  about it  get on the news  and say this is an  awful thing  but you just  don't see this  see one of the  that's why  what I hate  when they raise  the example  of Oklahoma  when that happened 
[01:24:30]  and they arrested  McVeigh and Nichols  everybody was  screaming for  these scumbags  to be executed  white people  black people  the whole country  came out  and said  these pigs  should be  executed  there was no  silent agreement  there was no  condoning by  not speaking out  and Muslim groups  have been awful  about speaking out  and sorry  Bin Laden  and the rest of  these fanatics  associate themselves  with Islam  they are saying  we are Islam  we're not saying 
[01:25:00]  that  they're saying  that  you're not going  to separate yourselves  don't be pissed off  when everybody  just goes  well he's saying  it's Islam  we're going to  look at you  like it's Islam  sorry about that  right  they're putting  faces on the  religion  they're the ones  putting the face  and unless  these people  come out  and speak out  against this  and try to put  that face  on the Muslim  religion  it's going to  be tied into  bombings  killing  terrorism  that's just  the way it is  sorry  and don't say  you can't  galvanize people  because how about  when the Quran  was torn up  when they're trying 
[01:25:30]  to get information  from people  who might be  trying to murder us  came out of the  woodwork for that one  the rage in the  streets  the rioting  meanwhile  al-zarkawi is  chopping off the  heads of civilians  not a fucking  peep  he's doing it  in the name of  Islam  not a fucking  peep  so I don't want to  hear about the  good side  and the good  people  and there's so many  it's just  like Colin said  a few million  bad apples  don't let a few  million bad apples  spoil the bunch  let's go to Paul  a couple more  a couple more  I mean you know 
[01:26:00]  when the IRA  does a bombing  they don't target  Irish Catholics  right  that's fine  of course  exactly  of course  they do  of course  they do  overseas  and even interned  them in Northern Ireland  and all God forbid  that would happen here  well we obviously  have to do  something different  to protect  these people  like I said before  London has been  on lockdown  as far as their  mass transit system  goes for two weeks  after that bombing  two weeks ago  they have probably  had the most  secure subway system  the most secure 
[01:26:30]  transit system  in the world  because two weeks  ago they were  they were bombed  and four bombs  again got on the  subways and a bus  it was just  sheer luck  they didn't blow up  another you know  maybe hundred people  this time  maybe more  what are you  supposed to do  how are we  obviously what  they're doing  isn't working  they're still getting  bombs on these  vehicles  disgusting  so you gotta  step it up  you gotta stop  trying to be  nice to groups  of people  and protect 
[01:27:00]  the people  that just  want to go  to work  Anthony  guys we are  doomed as a  society  until we  accept racial  profiling  just look at  the New Jersey  turnpike  racial profiling  works  and you know  what I hate  these  joke that  just bombed  anyway  I hate these  Muslims  that are so  arrogant and smug  when they get  interviewed  and they say  oh we're  really skeptical  we're skeptical  to see that  we won't be  profiled  if you don't  have anything  what the hell's  the point  you're the one  that's going  to get bombed  also  if you don't  have anything  and you're  on that train  you're going  to get bombed  just like us  so what are you 
[01:27:30]  hiding  oh they profiled  a lot of the  good Muslims  that were on  their way to  work in London  and got blown  to bits  you know  some uh  they showed  a girl  that was just  coming home  from work  a Muslim  girl  she had a  very Arabic  name  and uh  you know  blew up  they don't care  that's acceptable  to them  because it's uh  in jihad  you know  I mean  it's just  they're just  taught  that it's  acceptable  to kill  yourself  and other  people  and it's  just you know  keep doing it  keep doing it  but don't be  pissed off 
[01:28:00]  when everybody  looks at your  entire religion  and says  you're a problem  yeah  don't be angry  when we accept  the message  that these people  are giving  and you're not  standing up  as a group  and saying  this is ludicrous  showing outrage  they're just  silent  so what are we  supposed to see  your silence  or this guy  killing 50 people  with a bomb  strapped to him  and for those people  that say  are Saudi Arabia  relationship  is disgusting  I agree with you  it's awful  yeah  awful  Sean the trucker  Sean  yeah  let's go Sean  not too much  how are you guys  I didn't say that 
[01:28:30]  but what's up  what's up Sean  oh sorry  it's okay  have a good flight  you don't listen either  way to go  Brian Regan  thanks  the comment  I wanted to make  is you know  you're talking about  how they're gonna  affect innocent people  well the government  is already doing it  to truckers  you know  some of us  who've been  driving a truck  for a while  have hazardous  material permits  or endorsements  on our license  well now we have  to pass a background  check in order  to keep that  right  that could prevent  us getting a job 
[01:29:00]  and well you should  and instead of like  checking out  Middle Eastern drivers  you know  because there's  lots of them  out here  that are out  here driving  the truck  you know  they're checking  everybody  so you know  the poor person  that made a mistake  when he was 18  years old  might have a chance  of losing his career  because of these  people blowing  people up  yep  you know  he's trying to  bring it all home  to the trucker angle  alright Sean  a little angle there  we got more audio 
[01:29:30]  of the searching  of the bags  and the subways  Anthony  let's listen to this  but my life  isn't bad at all  I'm still on the air  I've got my kids  and I've got  Pat Battle  Pat Battle  she's the best friend  I could ever have  and who knows  with a little time  the right energy  I think I can talk  Pat Battle  into some hot  lesbo action  you bastards  even in the middle  of being serious  Pat Battle  love Pat Battle 
[01:30:00]  I want to pray  to you right now  Jesus Christ  who I love so much  more than anything  in the whole world  I am begging you  please  send  Pat Battle  to the United States  of America  to kill  Anthony  finally  thank you  I love you  I'll do whatever you say  if you just make that  come true  nice  added a few more  little names in there  yeah  alright  yeah this is going to  obviously this is the  first day of this  and you're going to 
[01:30:30]  see this story  just blow up  the news of course  having just a field day  with it  that's their top story  they got their reporters  all over the city  all over the subway station  opportunity for assaults  on the media  by the way  you see any of these  news guys  at the subway station  they're all over today  Penn Station  even in Jersey  Metro North  they're all over the place  so feel free to  yell ONA Party Rock  grab a sign  whatever  and have fun with it  because they're out  in force today  yeah the assault 
[01:31:00]  on the media contest  for July  is continuing  obviously  only what  like 10 days left  and the winner  will win a MiFi  and a day in the studio  with the gang  what a prize  not bad  listen on your MiFi  while you watch us  through the window  and the dude from  that's not in studio  the dude from Boston  is still in the lead  the dude in Boston  is still in the lead  you got to beat  that guy  who had a great assault  on the media  he was like topless  with his man boobs  and wow stickers  it was very very funny  we should send Harry  into subway stations  with a backpack  see if he gets searched 
[01:31:30]  you know  wouldn't that be great  yeah  or what Danny  Harry  yeah  we should send Harry  give him a big backpack  and send him into the subway station  and see if he gets searched  we should send Harry  and then like Nathaniel  yeah  you don't get much whiter  than Nathaniel  we'll see if they're profiling  yeah  let's see if they are profiling  that's a great idea actually  guarantee the news will do it  they'll send a couple of guys  of course they will  and we found  he was searched  in five out of six 
[01:32:00]  yeah  because the police  were displaying common sense  oh they can't get on the air  fast enough with that angle  of course  they wonder why we hate them  you'll see that all over the news  probably by this weekend  here in New York City  speaking of which  how about we take a break  we come back  we do the new news teases  yeah  we love  this ties in  the fear tactics  that the news uses  for us  to watch longer  scaring the crap out of us  ladies and gentlemen  here we go

[01:36:00]  three  I gotta go to  RottenTomatoes.com though  to get the real scoop  I don't care what the reviewers say  I've seen movies that  have been panned  and I thought they were great  and vice versa  so I don't care  I like to say vice versa  vice versa  vice versa  ooh  so I don't care  a little spin on that  I just go  oh gosh  stop  I'll definitely see the movie  I was just hoping it was gonna be  well we'll see  who's that  what are they saying on  Bad News Bears and  RottenTomatoes.com  let me get the  ooh  is that Spacey

[01:37:00]  to tell you the truth  really  yeah  the original is so great  I don't  you know  I just had faith in it  because Billy Bob Thorne  and then Bad Santa  you thought  okay  he can maybe make it just  slightly better than the original  right  okay  news teases  Anthony  news teases  yes  Moscow and flames  missiles headed toward New York  film at 11  wow  was that last night  Fox

[01:40:30]  on the Opie and  Anthony show  it's all about  fear  love the panic  and we're starting  to get more  from around the  country  we want you guys  to participate  in this bit  a little bit  more than you  have  yeah we hear  the local New York  ones and they're  great but we want  to hear what the  rest of the country  is doing  what fear they're  spreading  anthrax perhaps  in the Midwest  is that what it is  earthquakes in  California  is that what they  get their fear  mongering  is that where it's  set  stuff like that  yep  we got some  great examples  today so listen  to these great 
[01:41:00]  examples and if  you're hearing this  going on on your  local news please  please send them  in to steve at  steve at foundrymusic.com  ok  without further ado  here's the latest  batch of news  teases Anthony  ok is a birth  control patch  more dangerous  than the pill  we're going to  tell you what  doctors are saying  how about a  yes or no  that story should  take one second  you ask  it's it's  it's the format  is the same  every time  the question 
[01:41:30]  they present it  as a question  yeah  a fear question  and then  we'll give you  the answer  we'll tell you  we'll let you know  gee  will you  fear question  we'll get the  answer later  fear question  we'll give you  the answer later  by the way  before we move  on you know  we're abusing  the news on a  regular basis  these days  yeah  but we forgot  to talk about  that story  they did  about that  bogus traffic  cop guy  he's not a  he's a real  traffic cop  he's a real  traffic cop  guy  the guy 
[01:42:00]  looks like  he should be  standing in a  police lineup  he just looks  like a hip-hop  gangster  I gotta applaud  the news  they did this  story  we were laughing  so hard  in the office  they took  their cameras  out in  shame shame  shame fashion  and they  found these  two store  owners  in downtown  Manhattan  that were  being written  up tickets  for parking  near a hydrant  the only problem 
[01:42:30]  was  and they had  paid a few  of these  until they  realized  there was  no fire  hydrant  there  in front  of their  building  so the  news of  course  jumps on  it  and they  start looking  into other  tickets in the  area  that  by the way  were given  out by  the same  traffic  enforcement  guy  this guy  like I said  looked like  he belongs  in a police  lineup  and they  found some  inconsistencies  in his  traffic tickets  one guy  had a ticket  said he  parked 100 
[01:43:00]  feet from  the curb  so the  reporter gets  a big tape  measure  and measures  from the curb  100 feet  and it was  in the stock  room of a  store across  the street  another one  was parking  by a fire  hydrant  and it  was in  front of  a certain  address  he went  that address  didn't exist  and even if  it had  he panned  the block  there wasn't  a fire  hydrant  on the  entire block  not even  on the  entire block  and they  confront the  guy  the traffic  officer 
[01:43:30]  it was  really fun  and he's  just like  I don't  know  death  no comment  no comment  and they  just  they followed  his car  they  videotaped  him making  illegal turns  using his  lights  to go  through  red  lights  and then  they pull  him over  again  when he  parked  and the  news guy  jumps out  and starts  going  what about  these traffic  tickets  you're giving  there wasn't  a fire hydrant  there  he goes  I don't  want to  talk about  it  do we  still have  that audio  someone was  picking up  the audio  from it  if we can  find that 
[01:44:00]  because it  was just  pure comedy  the guy  is  it was  just  hilarious  what a  dick  he's probably  loafing  as they say  loafing  shiftless  shiftless  not doing  his job  and then  he probably  has 10  minutes left  on his  shift  and figures  he's going  to write  a few  tickets  say  that's  what I  did  all day  and let  them fight  it  if they  want  yeah  that's  it  they fight  it  they don't  they pay  it  who cares  hopefully  he'll get  fired  and executed  these traffic  enforcement  guys in the  city here 
[01:44:30]  are just  the worst  they're not  real cops  no  they  drive around  in cars  that kind  of look  like police  cars  they wear  uniforms  that kind  of resemble  NYPD  uniforms  but they  are just  these  morons  with  I don't  know  they're  scumbags  there's no  reasoning  with them  and I know  they hear it  all the time  but there are  certain situations  where it's like  you are just  being a prick  right here  I've seen  moms  with baby  carriages  like running  back up to  their car  as they're 
[01:45:00]  getting a  ticket  and you know  their meter  literally just  ran out  and these guys  will not give  anyone a break  it's like  the mother  begging and  pleading  like I was  please  please  you know  and they  don't even  listen to her  you know  they just stare  straight ahead  and just keep  writing  you know  what they  should be  ticketing  that I have  no problem  with  ticket the  shit out  of the  double parkers  people that  double park  ticket the  shit out  of them  that's what  I want to  see  don't waste  time because  somebody's meter  just ran out  three minutes  ago  if their 
[01:45:30]  meter's up  a half  hour  write them  up  it's the  double parkers  and the  goddamn people  that stop  in the middle  of the  intersection  I got in  an argument  with a bus  driver  yesterday  driving out  of town  driving down  57th  coming across  5th  and this  bus goes  to make  a turn  in front  of me  where I  had to  step on  the brakes  I was  going straight  he's making  a left  in front  of me  and there's  nowhere for  him to  go  he can't  complete the  turn  so what he  does is  make the  left enough  so he blocks  both lanes  now 
[01:46:00]  now I'm  sitting there  I got a  green light  I can't  go anywhere  so I  beep  I flip  him the  bird  and he  smiles at  me  he starts  laughing  I'm like  good move  motherfucker  you know  and then  his room  cleared  and he  stayed there  he sat  there  until the  light  turned red  for me  and then  he smiles  and drives  off  so I lay  on the  horn  and drive  right through  a bunch  of pedestrians  through the  red light  because I  wasn't going  to let  him  was he a  cabbie  no bus  driver  I hate  them  they are  pricks  they'll  turn right  and this  guy turned 
[01:46:30]  where he  couldn't  complete the  turn  he knew  it  he saw  it  he's going  to block  57th  and that's  what he did  he blocked  both lanes  both eastbound  lanes of 57th  fucking street  in Manhattan  you just want  to shoot people  and they won't  alternate merge  when going  into a tunnel  the bus  will stay  on the ass  of the other  bus  right  there are  times  I really  mean this  there are  times  this is why  I don't own  a gun  there are  times  where I would  have fired  into a bus  window  oh  the pleasure  and joy  it would give  you  just to see  the fact 
[01:47:00]  that you're  not doing  an alternate  merge  like I do  properly  the bullet  tearing into  your fat  stomach  and then all  you're picturing  is your family  as you're slumped  dead over the  wheel  and then I  drive away  happily  I've driven  with Jimmy  he means it  yeah I always  do the alternate  merge  the zipper  merge  you know  where one  the other  one  the other  one  the other  and you  could be the  biggest  I'm a prick  on the road  you know  but I give  courtesy to people  that want to  get in  to people that  want to get  somewhere faster  than I want to  get  let her rip 
[01:47:30]  do whatever  you want to  do  but there are  people that  just they get  right up on  the bumper  like what are  you doing  let me in  jackass  hey Opie that  looks really good  what are you eating  yogurt  what kind of  crunchy stuff  do you have  on there  granola  I'd like some  do you have  any in that  bag  here's where I  get my yogurt  chop chop  he's clapping  fetch me  a boy 
[01:48:00]  you are awful  John  jersey  go  what's up  boys  I had a friend  who  owned an  electrical business  in Brooklyn  who fucked  his truck  in his own  driveway  for what  for parking  in a  private  driveway  he said  so he went  inside  got a fire  extinguisher  jumped on top 
[01:48:30]  of the hood  of the car  and sprayed  the foam  fire  extinguisher  all over  the traffic  agent's car  they called  the 1013  come over  the regular  cops had to  come over  it was right  after they  merged with the  PD  and they had  to actually  lock my  friend up  for it  so they  taken him  over to  the station  house  and the  lieutenant  turns  and goes  did you  actually  jump on  the hood  of the  car  he goes  damn  straight  I did  and the  lieutenant  just  laughed it  off  and stuff  and then  they gave  him a  ticket  and took  off  but those  guys are  the worst  they've  ticketed  I'm a  medic in the  state  they've  ticketed our  ambulances  before 
[01:49:00]  and when we  were talking  like no  standing zone  and stuff  that's where  we're supposed  to sit  they'll give  tickets to the  ambulance  to write  you up  some of  them  I watch  these ticket  agencies  they'll just  sit at a  meter and  watch it  expire  I'm actually  writing a  movie  it's about  a couple  of ticket  agents  who are  coming up  out through  a manhole  and a  large vehicle  runs over  their skulls  and the movie  is called  Ha Ha  when we  get them  in the  ambulance  they'll say  they get  assaulted  by somebody  and stuff  we just  make them 
[01:49:30]  miserable  we tape  them down  we tape  along their  forehead  and stuff  we just  absolutely  do whatever  we can  to make  them  miserable  you do  what  motherfuckers  they'll get  hit  or something  like that  now they're  claiming  they hurt  their neck  or they hurt  this  they hurt  that  so you  got to  tape  their head  so it  doesn't  move  so what  these guys  do  tape  along their  eyebrows  I've heard  that these  guys will  do this  if they  don't like  you  or they'll  tape you  way up  on your  forehead  where your  hair is  so then  they have  to rip  your hair  out  when they  take the 
[01:50:00]  tape off  that's  hilarious  what kind  of yogurt  are you  eating  light and  lively  raspberry  I don't  want raspberry  but I would  like a  light and  lively  yogurt  yeah  light and  lively  blueberry  I'll have  a little  bit of  stuff  no  go  vanilla  or lemon  if you're  going to  throw the  granola  in  why  it just  tastes  better  that way  a safer  flavor  we don't want  too many flavors  I like  flavors  this is 
[01:50:30]  interesting  I never  thought of  this  Mark from  Yuma Arizona  is asking  what's a  double parker  I didn't even  realize that  because you're  from New York  and this doesn't  really happen  anywhere else  but New York  for some reason  that is something  that is something  I assumed  everyone would  know  in New York  double parking  everyone does  know  this is  what happens  you're driving  down the street  and there's  cars parked  on the left  side of the  street  and the right  side of the  street  and a truck  or a car  or whoever  will decide 
[01:51:00]  they will just  stop next to  the car that is  parked on the  side of the  street  and block  traffic  and get out  of their car  not standing  they'll get  out of their  car  go about  their business  and leave  their car  parked  next to a  parked car  in the middle  of the street  and sometimes  you're the car  that's blocked  in  and you have  no idea  when that guy  is going to  return  you're parked  there  and now a guy  just parked  next to you  you've got a  car in front  of you  a car behind  you  beep  you just lay  on the horn  you're completely 
[01:51:30]  blocked in  and now you have  to wait for this  guy to eventually  get back to his  truck  I've done the  over the sidewalk  where the only  way to get out  is to back up  and pull onto the  sidewalk  drive down the  sidewalk  until you find  an open space  and pull back  out onto the  road  because they  block you in  and when trucks  do this  there are times  where you cannot  even squeeze by  where someone  has to move  you beep  you bitch  at the truck  driver  but it's only  only in New York  do you see people  stopping in the  middle of the street 
[01:52:00]  that's what  double parking  is  alright let's  let's go to  Nate Brooklyn  Nate  hey good morning  boys  hey  hi  squishy nipples  my wife  last week  was taking  my six  week old  son to his  pediatrician  in Brooklyn  on King's  Highway  she is  parking the  car  she's in  the middle  of parallel  parking  when one of  those brownies  swoops down  an open spot  right in front of  the office  when she gets in  the woman hands  her a ticket  she says  what's it for  she goes for  double parking  you was blocking  traffic

I don't know  1,000 lakes  hey Anthony  here's the fake ticket  report from Fox 5  I've got to give  the news a little  credit today  because this story  just made us  really chuckle  and laugh  come on  guy handing out  erroneous tickets  I don't think  it's queuing up  land of lakes  land of 10,000 lakes  is that where  land of lakes  comes from?  is that where  the butter comes from?  the butter?  the little engine  chick on the front 
[02:02:30]  if you fold the cart  in the right way  it looks like she's  holding her tits  because her kneecaps  you ever do that?  yeah  is that land of lakes?  is that the butter?  yeah yeah yeah  it's got the engine  chick  and she's kneeling down  and she has like  her hands on her thighs  as she's kind of  squatting on her feet  and it's kind of like  dimples on the knees  on the knees  yeah  make it look like  nipples  and if you fold it  like you remember  the fold the back  of the mad magazine  kind of  you fold it in a certain  way to bring her knees  up to her tits  it looks like she's  holding her tits  it's a wonderful  little gag  to play as a child 
[02:03:00]  no I never did that  however  you ever heat up  a little Tupperware  thing of Mazzola  and stick your mule  in that?  that's rather lovely  Mazzola  corn goodness  isn't that awful?  alright here we go  it says the address  145 West 28th  but there's no  fire hydrant here  take a look  down there  no fire hydrant  up there  no fire hydrant  where's a fire hydrant  in front of this address? 
[02:03:30]  maybe it's a  vanishing fire hydrant  maybe it disappears  maybe it's like a ghost  well  how would the fire department  use the invisible  fire hydrant?  oh  they would like  make a little bit  out of it  right  where they  videotape the  fire hydrant  and then they move  the camera to another  sidewalk location  and do a slow fade  so it looks like  the fire hydrant  disappears  ooh  and then they're  asking people  how would the fire  department use  an invisible  fire hydrant  disappearing  fire hydrant  these two tickets  are for parking  in front of a hydrant  at 220 West 28th Street 
[02:04:00]  but there is no  220 West 28th Street  in fact this whole  building here  is the Fashion  Institute of Technology  but here's what's  more important  there are no  fire hydrants  on this entire block  take a look  yeah  he pans up and down  the street  he was so into this story  this is the one  he's submitting  this is like news gold  oh yeah  he's submitting this one  for like an Emmy  or something  okay this ticket  is for parking  100 feet from the curb  opposite of that address  115 West 28th 
[02:04:30]  so alright  let's go  we're gonna measure  100 feet here  he had a tape measure  100 feet  I'm in  in a closet  inside this store  of course  this is impossible  so let's measure  the other way  just in case  we're reading  this ticket wrong  kind of do it again  in fast motion  wacky  ow  90  alright there's  100 feet 
[02:05:00]  here's 100 feet  right inside this  flower shop  that's a tough  parking job  yeah  that's great  now this ticket  has five things  wrong with it  first of all  it's for parking  outside of 231 West 28th  now here's the address sign  it goes from 229 to 239  you know maybe 231  somewhere in the middle  but look at here  this is not a place  to park  it's a driveway  most people wouldn't  park in a driveway  and it's for parking  too close to a hydrant 
[02:05:30]  there is no fire hydrant  and it's for parking  four feet from the hydrant  so he made up  the four feet  and there's one other  thing wrong with this  ticket  the van that got the  ticket is a GMC  but the ticket says  the van was a Chevy  yeah you could get off  of those tickets  we got out of so many  parking tickets  because the person  wrote down the wrong  make of the car  the wrong color  and you could fight it  you go online  and you fight it online  and they send you a  receipt that says  eh you don't have to pay  very good  yeah  and finally 
[02:06:00]  now the cops  find this traffic agent  or whatever  yeah hunt them  all of these screwed up  tickets had one thing  in common  traffic agent Richardson  and that's the guy  we're following in this car  and his bad tickets  come with some bad  driving too  here he makes  an illegal right turn  from a middle lane  cutting off a cab  then here he puts on his  overhead emergency lights  to blow through a red light  I got a bunch of tickets  here written by you  for fire hydrants  where fire hydrants  don't exist  no comment 
[02:06:30]  you write fake tickets  no  you have an imagination  are you imagining  there are fire hydrants  in places where they're not  you got tickets  so you have tickets  for a hundred feet  off the sidewalk  which would put somebody  in the middle of a building  and he's just boggled  he's trying to walk away  the guy's chasing him  that's a good one  so he has to be fired  obviously  he has got to be fired  I hope he loses his pension  how great is that  he has got to be fired 
[02:07:00]  he was a young guy  he looked like he was  in his twenties  had cornrows  looking like  you know  didn't want to really  be there  kind of thing  you know  shiftless  alright let's go to Matt  in Minnesota  Matt  yo um  I just want to  school you guys  on Minnesota  alright  it's a land of  10,000 lakes dude  and uh  we have like  20,000  so they got it  kind of wrong  on the logo  that's how they  bring tours here  20,000 lakes  about 20,000

[02:15:00]  there he is  happy birthday  Ben  thank you  big 3-0  big 3-0  that is  that is a landmark  birthday there  how did our executive  producer get older  than us  30 years old  how the fuck  do you get older  than us  all of a sudden  when we're only  28  I have a birthday  truffle  and a calf  wow  30  how does it feel  Ben  were you really  thinking a lot  about it 
[02:15:30]  because I know  when a guy  turns 30  when anybody  a guy or girl  turns 30  you kind of think  about a month  a couple months  out  you're thinking  your 20s are gone  you know  did you think  about it at all  a little bit  a little  not dwelling on it  a little bit  everyone thinks  about every  waking moment  a year out  30 is a bad one  you turn 29  and then you just  start every day  thinking about it  yeah  and it just starts  playing on your mind  yeah right from  your 29th birthday 
[02:16:00]  you're like  oh no  30  here it comes  because you remember  when you were a kid  and you kind of go  wow what year is it  going to be  when I'm 30  and it seems  so far away  and then all of a sudden  wow I'm here  2007  to answer your question  here it is  oh really  yeah  by the way  speaking of what  you see who's outside  oh dirty  he wants to get paid now  he's asking me to get paid  for his appearance today  you want to get paid  yeah I told him to ask you  tell him to steal something  no no  we tried that last time  with the old days 
[02:16:30]  pipe cutter  and cut off a couple of  tops of parking meters  we got to get all dirty  to talk about all the scams  they do in the hood  that's one of my favorites  yeah that's one of my  favorite things  he claims he hasn't  been in jail  since the last time  he was here  which was a while ago  so that's pretty good  that is good for him  alright so what are you  doing for your birthday  nothing  watch the red sox  are you going to  throw yourself a party  like you do every year  maybe in september  or something  30 I think  I thought he would  have a big party  like he did that one year  Ben  you know what  Ben throws a party 
[02:17:00]  for himself every year  it's the greatest idea ever  you know what it is though  because then you get to do  what you want  on your birthday  like what was it last year  we did the bowling thing  or is that two years ago  last year I didn't even do anything  no  well we did the 27th birthday  it was a real good one  the best birthday  the happy ending one  with Voss  remember the year  you had the pony at the party  and then they filmed it  but you can only see  the lower part of your torso  and the pony moved up  a little farther  than you wanted to  that's funny  yeah what was the name  of that place  Happy Ending  it was an old massage parlor  yeah that was a good one 
[02:17:30]  Jim was there  Voss was there  an old Yankee Cranky shop  they turned into a club  Andrew WK  they had the old  guy from the spin doctor  yeah  they had the old steam rooms  without the doors on anymore  and they just had candles  and you'd sit on the tiles  and drink your booze  and stuff  that was a great  great time  yeah  that one made page six  it did  one of Ben's parties  actually got into page six  in the paper  about the celebrities  that were there  and Voss  Voss  hey it's Voss  so  oh  Jesus  I'm out of here  why 
[02:18:00]  I was like  I don't know  what a good birthday bum  car crash  no no  no  you're in a category  all by yourself  that's not even a car crash  that's just a cake  falling off the floor  and cutting  falling off the floor  yes  because the house  was turned upside down  in a tsunami  falling off the floor  cake fell off the floor  candle right through her head  I'm Mike in Illinois  Mikey 
[02:18:30]  child bakery  hey I got a Ben's Hog joke for you  alright  Ben's Hog is so big  it doesn't even have  the same birthday  that's kind of funny  if you think Ben's Hog  will celebrate  its birthday next week  I like it  with a little big party hat  on its head  alright  Ben's Hog  is unshaven  like a Muggsy  and it smokes a cigar  that's what Ben's Hog looks like  let's go to Chicago  we haven't said hi  to Chicago in a while  hey Shacktown  what's up  hey guys

[02:20:00]  all that stuff  carrots  Jimmy gets so excited  at the guy's answer  he dropped his yogurt  all over the place  it's all over his truffle box  oh no I could have been injured  alright Ted is basically  just trying to stump you Anthony  yeah  trying to stump the professor  actually a listener  it's easy to stump me  let's have a thing for you  a little quiz  oh really  yeah maybe we'll have it on the air  Monday  I would take his little quiz  that question ate my ass  stunk  what's the biggest exporter 
[02:20:30]  of lettuce in Asia  they got the produce  down there  who cares  oh yeah  let's go to David in Ohio  David  hey boys how's it going  hey  hi  I wanted to just point out  a not listening example  of like this  oh there's another example  yeah when Anthony  when you were talking about  that bus driver  that cut you off  yeah  you said bus  and bus driver  at least 10 times  and then little Jimmy  piped in with  was it a cab  I don't know  this guy's gotta be  pulling a gag  are you pulling a gag 
[02:21:00]  that's very funny though  fella  rewind it  and listen man  maybe Jimmy  just got scared  I  you know  don't ruin it  because I really want to believe  he actually called up  legitimately with this  so thank you  for pointing that out sir  okay  thank you for pointing out  that we don't listen  by the way  I think there's a no listen  moment from me  when Sandy Cain was in  because I remember saying  pointing out Sandy Cain  the lipstick  on her coffee cup  and I heard  on the replay  I heard Ovi go  look at all the lipstick 
[02:21:30]  on her Starbucks cup  so  I don't know  if it was you  not listening to me  and I said it first  you know  I have no idea  I'm not sure either  but I don't know  who said it first  Nathaniel's writing it down  and I'm sure  he'll go through it  alright  but yeah  one of us are guilty  of not listening that day  let's say hi to Tommy  in Jersey  Tommy  hey boys  how you doing  real quick question  is this the same  Ben Sparks  who used to be  the intern for you guys  oh yeah  was he an intern  well he wasn't an intern  he was like  he was just working  in the promotional department

[02:27:30]  Jimmy Norton  the next segment  is all about him  he was in the bathroom  last I saw  trying to peek at you  peek into my stall  right  I cannot  go take a leak  without both of you  assholes  because he's trying to  he walked  I walked in  right when he was  walking out  he turns around  and follows me  like an inch  behind me  hey what are you doing  as I walk into the stall  I have to kick him out  and shut the door  and then Opie's  hanging over 
[02:28:00]  from the other stall  trying to  stick his head  over the top  of my stall  yeah this is what we do  while you're listening  to those dumb promos  those dumb XM promos  so I'm yelling  leave me alone  I have to piss  you would think  we'd be organizing  for the next break  no  we're just fucking around  in the bathroom  toilet hijinks  at least we admit  how awful we are  lots of instant feedback  coming in about Ben  you know the Ben's hog  thing is getting  kind of old  but with that said 
[02:28:30]  Joe S. from Quorum, New York  Ben's hog is so big  he had to pull out  of his mother  after birth  that is not right  at all  should have left it in  Ben's birthday  James from Hicksville, New York  good gosh  for his 30th birthday  Ben is going to stay  at home  and his hog  is going to go  to the Sox game  aww  and Hib Shooter  from North  North Hampshire  New Hampshire  of course  you can tell Ben's  real age  by counting the veins 
[02:29:00]  on his hog  quickly  it is a quick thing  remember how happy  I was when I had  written Michael Dell  an email  and gotten a response  and I needed two  case fans  for my computer  I thought that was  finally over  and it had taken  a month and a half  well that's what  as I last reported  somebody from America  got in touch with me  shipped out the fans  sent me an email  confirming this  I got everything  the tracking number  for the shipment  and everything  and it was on its way  and I thought  problem solved 
[02:29:30]  finally  it wasn't delivered  yesterday  it was supposed to be  delivered  so I decided  I would track it  so I went to the  DHL thing  put in the tracking number  the fans  have been delivered  to my address  I moved out of  a year ago  in Brooklyn  New York  you motherfucking  incompetent  assholes  yes  on five separate  occasions  during this  debacle  with me trying 
[02:30:00]  to get a  ventilation fan  for my computer  I have given  my new address  in Great Neck  New York  to five different  Indian  savages  that do the  customer service  now  instead of  regular  American people  at Dell  and  I gave them  my address  on five different  occasions  as a matter of fact  when I bought  the computer  originally  about eight months  ago  that I need  the fan for  they shipped  it to my  new address  so you would  assume  they had  my new address 
[02:30:30]  well  they sent  the fans  to Brooklyn  I will not  drive to  Brooklyn  to get my  fans  and apparently  the super  of the building  signed for them  my name  and address  on there  I haven't  lived there  for a year  and the super  signed for it  so it's probably  sitting in the  lobby  and I'm sure  it's being  ripped off  by somebody  just like my  Christmas gifts  were a couple  of Christmases  back  get things  delivered  I was shopping 
[02:31:00]  online for  family  the super  would sign  for it  leave it on  a table  in the lobby  of the building  and the brothers  would come through  and it was  Christmas for them  oh what I got  here  a first edition  Stephen King book  yeah motherfucker  that's what you  gotta do  you gotta wait  for the FedEx  truck  UPS truck  oh they ain't  home  I'll sign for that  yeah  you know  well here's  something else  I did  when I had  to get a  computer delivered  oh  hold on a second  maybe the 
[02:31:30]  computer was  delivered to  Brooklyn  I had  sent  I had  made an order  for a computer  in Brooklyn  I moved  and they  were gonna  ship it  I tried  to get  the address  changed  and they  said  we don't  change  addresses  you gotta  cancel the  order  and reorder  it  which would  take now  a month  so I said  fuck that  so I  found out  when the  delivery date  was gonna  be  went to  Brooklyn  and waited  in the  lobby  and when  FedEx  came  I made  it look  like I  was walking  off the  elevator  and I  was like  oh  finally  it's  here  I  signed  it  took  it  brought  it out  to my 
[02:32:00]  truck  outside  and drove  away  with it  no ID  check  nothing  no ID  no nothing  yeah  hoes  that'd be  my computer  look at this  laptop  old dirty's  in the studio  and old dirty's  an old pro  at some of these  scams  you know  these things  of delivery  it's  it's  it's  you follow  the UPS  he's like  the ice cream  man for you  guys  well you  don't  you don't  want to  wait  you don't  want to  do it  like  where you  live  you want  to go  a couple  of  you  probably  you even  want to  go to  another  neighborhood  you want  to probably  go to  a good  neighborhood 
[02:32:30]  when you  know  some good  stuff  is going  to be  delivered  you look  like a valet  or you  know  you got  a little  sweeping  sweeping  also you  carry a  little  broom  and dustpan  around the  apartment  complex  and you  sweep up  the FedEx  guy  comes  hey  I'm  the  porter  guy  I'll  sign  for  that  yeah  or  you  leave  it  in  the  lobby  and you  look  like  you're  doing  something  wear  a little  uniform  you should  get  your  dickies  on  ready  to  go  fuck  that  I'm  the  porter  I'll  sign  for  that  what are

[02:39:00]  any newsstand you'll see her  you gotta be kidding  and I banged her  and I banged her  she was hot  and she was a great kisser  she was really sexy  and then she would come in with other girls  see it's a hooker that gives the girlfriend experience  so that's kissing involved  and it's like she's really there  and really digs you  it's not just like you know  Yankee Cranky  happy ending  get the fuck out  but yeah I heard  she used to go to clubs  and hit  and hit  motherfuckers off for free though  and that her man  and that her man was all upset  and shit  because she wasn't cashing in no chips 
[02:39:30]  when you know  when she was giving it up  right  it's all about the money  you know what I mean  yeah  so then  well he's in Rikers  so he better take care of himself  yeah  so when this gets a buck  0-5 in that motherfucker  you better  you better be on point  why everybody's cranky  hell fucking yeah  no AC  no AC  no AC in Rikers  well they got a little bit  come on man  it's not gonna be like the best AC  you know what I'm saying  you're incarcerated  they're trying to make you  as uncomfortable as possible  I can't see like the warden going  why don't we turn the thermostats down

[02:41:00]  or some of the lockups  like Rikers and stuff  they never  they say  nah that shit doesn't happen  but it's the biggest fear  it's the one thing  that most keeps people  from committing crimes  is the fear of  the ass raping in prison  we get these ex-cons  on the show all the time  now one will admit  to anything  fuck the ass raping  you don't wanna  you don't wanna catch  a bullet in there  you don't want somebody  with a gun  cause you're gonna get  a buck fifty  you're gonna get a buck  a gun  a gun in jail  is uh  is uh  improvised razor

[02:44:00]  because you can't  on the internet say  oh by the way  you can pay for sex  so how is it worried  no absolutely not  and that's not  that's not what  the agency was about  that whole girlfriend  experience thing  is about spending  multiple hours  with someone  you know  basically like  having a real date  you just gave me  a pamphlet  you expect me  to read all this  is this like  a homework assignment  Eric  Jesus  he's reading  look at this  page one  this is 13 pages 
[02:44:30]  how we  I just got  a god damn  paper cut  from this pamphlet  too  son of a fuck  those are the worst  fucking cuts  god I hate  paper cuts  I want to give you  one right across  the hole of your mule  watch  I'm not looking  can I see  the picture  I'm not thinking  about paper cuts  what the fuck  are you doing  oh god  god look how good  she looks here  with her little butt  sticking out  let me peep that shit  oh  you had some of this  yeah  OD

[02:45:30]  excuse me sir  now they don't care  all you gotta do  is listen to this radio show  13 pages  oh my god  alright  I don't know why  oh damn it  my brother's on the phone  I didn't wish him  a happy birthday  who dat brother Joe  aww  hi Joe  hey what's going on man  happy birthday  to you  aww  yeah it was the 21st  which was yesterday  yeah happy birthday  I'm on Nantucket anyway  yeah well that's the problem 
[02:46:00]  you can't get a hold of  the jet setting Joe  and his U2 band  come on man  I'm on my show all the time  you're on Nantucket  you can't get a signal  on Nantucket  I'm calling from my  my bedroom in Nantucket  overlooking  the beautiful  Nantucket Bay  right now  what are you at  a bed and breakfast  with the rest of you two  are you a man  from Nantucket  I once called  Joe on Nantucket  that could get real nasty  yes  so I hope you found the studio 
[02:46:30]  how you doing bro  yo what's good brother Joe  what's up  you're finally back  yo son  I can't  I can't wait  to get to Boston  tonight for a show  at Shenanigans  in Southie  now that's a good plug  Joe  you just come out  and say  I can't wait  to get there  like it's not really  a plug  he's just sitting  around with his  U2 cover band  sharing my feelings  making mad cash  yo  yo yo  brother Joe  yo  Nantucket  they only allow 
[02:47:00]  they only allow  rich crackers  up in there  right  isn't that where  the late  John F. Kennedy  Jr.  was jetting off  to after  you know  I think actually  it was Martha's Vineyard  but they're pretty close  part of Cape Cod  hey did you take  the little plane there  yeah a little six seat  actually it was a ten seater  Cessna  did you get to fly  left seat  yes  you did  yeah Joe  sits up front  yeah  I don't have that 
[02:47:30]  rapport going  with the pilot  yeah  I'm sure the rest  of the band  is really thrilled  when they find out  that you're actually  steering the plane  flying the plane  I know you have  experience and all  but that's gotta  just be a little weird  the latest in avionics  no the guys actually  appreciate the fact  that I can fly  cause uh  you know  God forbid  this fat pilot  ate one too many  bacon and egg  sandwiches  that's  all over dead  at least I'll put  him down on the ground  yeah  put her down  in one piece 
[02:48:00]  in one piece  that's what I hate  about flying  cause there's usually  what two guys  in the cockpit  and you see  the one guy  all of a sudden  just leave the cockpit  and go into the bathroom  yeah  but you're  no well  there's still one  in there  but then you think  well what if he has  a heart attack  or something  and then the door  is locked  and he can't  what  taking too many chances  you want two guys  in there  at all times  but you don't  yeah you  you don't even  have a co-pilot  in that plane  no  like Joe's  the co-pilot  it's just one guy  that's it  yeah that's why 
[02:48:30]  I'm always in the front  I always take  the front seat  so you're  you're doing this  a lot now  with the planes  huh  oh yeah  yeah well  every time we come  over in there  talking about  Block Island  yeah  actually we're  well  the flight  the commercial  flights that we  have coming up  are ridiculous  I just booked  Nova Scotia  Mexico City  Seattle  Dublin  Ireland  and we're  going down  to  actually over  to Portugal  that's something  there's a demand 
[02:49:00]  for a YouTube  tribute band  in fucking  Portugal  you can't imagine  all of the markets  that YouTube  does not hit  we are  in such high demand  it's  I have to turn  them down  I have to turn  a lot of these  markets down  so it's all the  fans that love  YouTube  but never get  to see you  too live  so they want  to you  the agency  goes over to the  website  and shows it  to the buyer  the buyer  sees the video  and hears the audio  and immediately  hire us  I mean  this is 
[02:49:30]  this is without  question  they've been  hiring us  you realize  your brother's  going to get  kidnapped somewhere  right  I know  down in Portugal  who's going to  fucking kidnap me  that's great  and I'm going to  go see him  next weekend  not this coming  weekend  but next weekend  in Atlantic City  I'm going down  Friday  to go see  Tom Jones  and then  dude did you  read that  ultrajones.net yet  no I got to  check that out  it's a  Tom Jones tribute  read ultrajones.net  and watch the videos  you'll crap yourself

[02:55:30]  Ben came into the studio  the birthday boy  to remind us  that we're slowly but surely  starting to think about  our first anniversary show  gonna make a really big deal  coming close to a year on the air  we've had to sit out  like two and a half years  that sucked  that was a bad time  that shit was horrible  that shit really sucked  and it's amazing  but I guess we've been broadcasting  almost ten months now  almost ten months already  Matt quickly has a question 
[02:56:00]  OD asked Joe  if he needed a roadie  was he talking about  the one he stole  from Opie's car  did you steal mine?  what the fuck  I stole from you?  well it was a Delphi  nah nah nah  I never steal from fan beat  no?  what are you  you used to steal stuff?  nah nah nah nah  never do that  that's dishonorable  son  are the brothers  I never steal from anybody  that I know personally  or I consider my friend  they can leave a stack of bills  in that motherfucker  I'll take like one 
[02:56:30]  and shit  but you know  I never  so I guess you didn't know us  for the first year  we were at WNW  his eyes would light up  he'd walk into the studio  and he'd be eyeing computers  and TVs  and just like his eyes  would light up  like you were in a store  like you were just shopping  it was extremely tempting  but the problem was  getting it out of said facility  yeah  he got accused of stealing  phone cards  yeah  yo yeah  I hope he never  fucking believed me  we had ONA phone cards  I don't remember  that's so long ago 
[02:57:00]  remember the WOW phone cards  yeah  we had a whole box of them  and they disappeared  they had like five dollars each  obviously give me like  one ten minute call  or something whatever  and we were just accusing you  because he happened to be there  they disappeared  but it turned out  Eddie  hit him  alright  you gotta put these away  we're garbage  where's Ben  because when we start talking about Eddie  Ben can't get enough of this  look he's laughing already  yeah  Ben do you remember the phone  remember the phone cards Ben  that we thought old dirty stole  and then it turned out 
[02:57:30]  Eddie had been hitting them  I put him over here  with the garbage  it was garbage  like where  Opie car  you know Opie car  I just heard that  I just heard the Eddie replay recently  the old  not the old  well I guess he's older  yeah  he's like 50 years old  used to work at NEW  just you know  taking the garbage away  he was a little  he got a couple of mental issues  as far as being challenged  and so they put him in charge  of the garbage  delivering the garbage  throwing out the garbage  and delivering the mail  which was great 
[02:58:00]  he couldn't read  but they gave him  they gave him our mail  so you know  my pay envelope  would end up in Don Geronimo's mailbox  and Earl's stuff  would end up in Ben's  the guy  who is this  who is this  who is this right here  who is this  Carol Miller  and it's like  it was ridiculous  oh yeah  I remember Carol Miller  the night bird  right  the stalk  whatever the fuck she was  she was such a cunt  we used to  you used to have arguments  we used to stay over 7 o'clock 
[02:58:30]  that was at the inception  that was like at the birth  a lot of that old audio  is up on oavirus.com  by the way  for the new listeners  we used to get some crazy stuff  with some of the other people  that worked at the old station  you were always being accused  of thievery  yeah well  you know  nothing was ever proven  so  Jimmy's head is just  are you alright Jimmy?  Jimmy is asleep  you've been asleep  for like 20 minutes  Jimmy's been asleep  the reason  people  you've got to picture this  the reason you have not heard Jimmy talk  he is sitting in his chair 
[02:59:00]  his feet are up on the console  his eyes shut  his head tilted  he is asleep  he is sleeping  during the show  but you've been laughing a little bit  I'm like  I'm a really weird  like half  like I'm listening  and I'm hearing  you know  talk about the phone cards  and you said  one time you made a term  but the bus wouldn't let you go  what other job can you be at  where you can just nod off  in the middle of it  this is the kind of fucking job  that I want  if it's a great job  top dollar to stop  come on my man 
[02:59:30]  come on  yo Jimmy  I gotta give you pounds  you're sleepy Jimmy  what happened  long night  I didn't get to bed  I had bad dreams  I'll be having night terrors  too dude  for real  yo you be having night terrors  Jimmy  I punched this girl  in the fucking face  I got three in the morning  oh I felt so bad  he has this awful dream  that he's walking through  an office in a suit and tie  got there on time  yo for me  I woke up  I just went  oh 
[03:00:00]  bing  and I clapped  in the  oh I felt bad  you punched her in the head  but she still went  you know  she sucked my dick though  after that  she should have  you dreamt she wasn't listening  let's go to Kirby  in Oklahoma City  Kirby  look at that  oh  wow  wow  wow  let me at least see  turn this way  turn this way  look at that  totally takes care of yourself  I mean look at that  look for all that  for dessert tickets  you got them  I have no idea what that is  it's a wacky radio alert 
[03:00:30]  oh  am I here  yeah what's going on  Kirby  oh we have  a 94-7  the buzz  in Oklahoma City  and they  got some girl  in the studio  in a softball uniform  and her sole purpose  there was to strip  and she only took  her top off  and they're  they're begging her  they're down on their  hands and knees  trying to get her  to take her pants off  they finally had to  give her concert tickets  these guys are  fucking pathetic  I don't know  I kind of relate to that  that's a nice audio  from Jimmy's apartment  she's already  she's already naked now 
[03:01:00]  I think she had  they had to give her  disturbed tickets  to get her to get naked  and her only deal  was that no one  looked at her butt  no one look at her butt  yeah that was her  her one condition  that she would get naked  why  I guess she's  a little self-conscious  I'm not sure  that's a badass  she's probably just  fashion firm  from cheek to cheek  covering the crack  alright thanks sir  no problem  thanks guys  this is an XM satellite  you fucking  I like it  what the fuck  was that all about  I gotta hang up

[03:03:00]  I see there's a feature  in the latest issue  called happiness  is a bucket of nails  yeah that's a local band  what the fuck  oh okay  the story of a local band  alright  you did a big  you must have done  a big story  on the kid almost  drowning at Disney  no not at all  no  that was a newsworthy  but that was a big story  they got that big  football agent  NFL agent  took him out of the pool  and  yeah  the TV stations  handled that pretty well  do you have like  um like adult ads  in the back of this paper  uh I think we do  yes  ah okay  alright we'll talk to you  yes 
[03:03:30]  alright now we'll talk to you  the new revenue stream  sir  alright Jason  so what do you have today  well um  I'm obviously calling about  the uh the whole  Jim Phillips incident  is it a big story  in the Orlando area  it's about to be  uh it's about to be  yeah  it's about to be  a huge story  down there in Orlando  not at all  no  not at all  uh  for this one market  sensation  well  Jesus  he's the one market  sensation  he's actually a really  good show  I really  you know  I gotta say  I like you guys  shut up 
[03:04:00]  yeah he's a good  of course he's a good show  he picks the best things  from every other show  and uses them  well that's what  you know  that's really what  I'm calling  just to try to find out  I want to find out  what happened  at the beginning  I found out  what happened  when the pest  got on his case  but I'm trying to figure out  what happened  at the beginning  can you make sure  that you acknowledge  the pest  in your article  oh  it would make their month  and they're not stopping  by the way  you can tune in today  Monday  Tuesday  you will still hear  the pest on the phone  they will not let up  on this guy 
[03:04:30]  he was gonna steal something  and look  we all talk about the media  and we don't like the media  and that's understandable  that's not Opie and Anthony's topic  that's no  the media is the media  but it was such a specific way  he was talking about it  did you write that down  the media is the media  ok go  wow that's good Jimmy  that was very good Jimmy  I'm always going to  take one word  and saying it's the exact same word  like the ass is the ass  which suits me well  he was gonna steal an idea  and then he's getting on the air 
[03:05:00]  and he's going  and I'm gonna talk to the manager  and make sure we can  my program director  make sure we can do this  and I want to make sure  nobody rips me off  meanwhile he has come out  and admitted that he was  stealing the bit  and he got his inspiration  from a New York Times article  he had brought that up  on the air  which is still online  by the way  and said he got his inspiration  from that  and meanwhile  that New York Times article  in the first sentence  mentions the Opie and Anthony show  and in the first couple of paragraphs  mentions what we were doing  with the press 
[03:05:30]  and that's where he said  he got his inspiration from  yet he denies ever hearing of us  knowing who we are  what we do  he's just a phony  a liar  a hack  I mean people steal things  in radio  you see it all the time  it pisses you off  but what are you gonna do  but this guy is so arrogant about it  and so pompous  and just when you hear him on the air  you just want your listeners  to pound him  and he's not a funny guy 
[03:06:00]  we listened to his rebuttal  he's a baby  he ran to his bosses  he had a cease and desist put  so he couldn't play his audio  he cried  he went behind the scenes  to clear a channel  and he bitched  he's yelling bring it on  bring it on  and then he's dumping out of calls  you can't mention Opie and Anthony's name  he's an absolute fraud  and he's getting his face smashed by our listeners  yeah he was brave enough  the first day to challenge our pests  and then when they brought it on  he couldn't handle it at all  so then he hid behind his bosses  and the bosses took legal action 
[03:06:30]  so we can't play his audio on our show anymore  his awful audio  and man that would have gave us  three hours of radio today  because it's just so awful  he can't help but make fun of it  what were you saying sir  oh I was just  I was saying that your pests  were definitely in attack mode yesterday  they tore down his web board  it looked like  they are the worst  yeah his website has been down for two days  you will not be able to get to it again today  his phone lines are gone  and this seems like a guy who really uses the phones a lot  it has been taken away from his show 
[03:07:00]  the phones  our pests will continue to keep calling him  and ruining his program  our pests are running his radio show  Jason would you like to talk to some of our pests for your story  oh Jesus sure  we have one of our top pests here  are you going to write a positive story or a negative story  I am all about the facts sir  I said are you going to write a positive story or a negative story  as I hold your phone number in my hand 
[03:07:30]  well like I said  I found that  I found that  one radio show I like  has taken on another radio show I like  so I'm definitely stuck in the middle  cool  you know Jason  this could turn into an AP story  if you write it right  I hope not  because at this point  we have decided to take on commercial radio  what  we have decided to take on commercial radio  like this  just like this  using the pest  he's a thief dude  he's a thief  and that's the worst thing you can be in entertainment  well I gotta tell you  you know personally  from where I stand 
[03:08:00]  I found it interesting  because the other bits  of other shows  that you guys have played on there  especially the horrible morning shows you play  yeah  that  oh you are a fan  every morning when I listen  and I just found it weird  to hear a show that I listen to  get up on there  and get made fun of  I was like well that's weird  because it didn't sound good  when I heard it  I was like oh man  he does sound  he doesn't sound like  he came off too well  you know why I do  because you're making a relative comparison then  you live in the area  you drive home  you listen to him  he's harmless  but now he's coming off going  I'm funnier than those guys  and you can hear his fake radio voice 
[03:08:30]  this is the way we talk  this awful mic technique I have  half the time you can't hear me  I stink  but this is my voice  today Jimmy just fell asleep for 20 minutes  because he can on this show  he falls asleep on this show  we're jackasses  but we're honest  you know  I'm going to put on my fake voice  and he's just a fraud  and a thief  which to me is the greatest crime you can commit  and he's one of many in commercial radio  they're just a bunch of liars  they'll lie about anything  did you hear about all the lies Jason  did you hear about  how he was saying  he's number one 
[03:09:00]  as far as non-music channels  on XM Satellite Radio  I heard him say that  yeah now  did you also hear  our call  with  with our  the head  muckety-muck  Elo  Eric Logan  over at XM  as far as programming goes  and he got on our show  and said  this is not true  yeah  I heard that too  and then  jackass gets on the air  and starts talking about  how that wasn't really  Eric Logan  so now we throw it back  in his court  and I  I bet him 
[03:09:30]  a hundred thousand dollars  to prove that  that wasn't  Eric Logan  from XM Satellite Radio  it was absolutely  Eric Logan  this guy cannot be honest  with his listeners  he's just got a lie  saying we don't get paid  by XM  we have to pay  to broadcast here  and  he's  full of shit  yeah because I've heard  Eric Logan  on y'all's show before  so  yeah we were just  setting up for this  very moment  for the past year  that's what we were doing  it's definitely him  and the guy again  he's a hack  he's a liar  well he could take  a hundred thousand dollars 
[03:10:00]  from me  if he could prove  it wasn't Eric Logan  hey I'm going to  put you on the phone  with one of the generals  of the O&A Army  who's that  Doug out Doug  Doug out Doug  one of the many generals  good general  Doug you're representing  a lot of pests out there  so do them proud  this is Jason  from some stupid  free newspaper  in the middle of Orlando  hey Doug  I actually want to ask  this guy  did you get an email  from me about this  or did you hear about  this on your own  I heard about it  on the show  I listened to the show  oh ok 
[03:10:30]  because I was doing  an assault of the media  last night  letting everybody  know about this  trying to get it  picked up by the news  so I could win a mi-fi  no sorry  yeah hey  this guy is an  absolute and complete  hack  we're dominating  his show  and we fully intend  on doing so  all through next week  do you have any  questions for me sir  well no  what's the plan  of attack  really  we're just going  to continue  to dominate  his message board  dominate his show  because I mean  as you can hear  because you are  an O.P. Anthony  listener  these guys  that you're talking 
[03:11:00]  to right now  are the masters  of doing four hours  of filler  this guy  well that's it  I'm leaving  this guy does  about two minutes  of filler  and repeats  every five minutes  when he has to  reload his dump  did you catch  yesterday at one  point where he  was so frustrated  he just started  going  Anthony  Cami  Greg Hughes  he just kept  saying your names  he couldn't think  on his feet  at all  Doug  we are filler  masters 
[03:11:30]  you're absolutely  right  continue  you guys are  the best  you guys rock  don't forget  that the army  is also starting  to mail gay porn  to the radio station  and let's not  forget the assault  on the local  pizza and Chinese  restaurants  around the studio  yeah they got  plenty of pizza  and Chinese food  in an effort  that can only  be equaled  by third graders  they sent them  food from  delivery services  and be sure  to mention  in that article  if you are  writing an article  either for the web  or for this 
[03:12:00]  what free paper  at the supermarket  or something  to go ahead  and mention  that we are  all fully aware  that we have  nothing better  to do  I am 29 years old  I am a single  father  I have a desk job  so nothing  pleases me more  than when  3 o'clock hits  and I can actually  do something  I enjoy  and that's  piss somebody else  in Orlando off  that's the mindset  by the way  of every single 
[03:12:30]  one of these pests  that's why we don't  get on their bad side  this isn't something  they're doing  going well  O&A are saying  to do it  so I guess  we'll do it  they relish  this shit  they enjoy  screwing  with this asshole  and that's  D-U-G  O-U-T  D-O-U-G  because I am  also an  absolute  attention whore  I like this guy  to see my name  somewhere  will absolutely  be incredible  for me  dug out Doug  dug out Doug 
[03:13:00]  I'll get that  God bless  alright  we'll put you on  with the Boston  Strangler  from whackbag  dot com  oh here's another  one  another pest  they have secret  websites by the way  sir  secret websites  that we have no  idea where they are  good morning  good morning  Boston Strangler  hey what's going on  boys  I just want to call  in representing  the pests  I also too  have a desk job  and I snuck out  to the Boston  Common to give  you guys a call  and let this  reporter know  that we will not  be stopping 
[03:13:30]  anytime soon  good  yeah I think  I think  Jim was trying  to make it  part of his show  make it entertaining  have a little fun  with it  it was kind of  different from  his usual  day to day show  and that might be  the case  but in a week  in two weeks  in a month  of this  every day  taking his phones  away  he is going to  be livid  and he will be  begging to have  this stop  our listeners  now control  his show  we have hijacked  his show  he thinks 
[03:14:00]  these listeners  are just dumb  old  so we're just  going to call  him  but they are  really smart  and funny  and they coordinate  and believe me  he is in a lot  of trouble  and his arrogance  people can hear  his arrogance  and it just makes  you want to attack  his show more  well definitely  I mean I myself  am an NBA  candidate over  at Brandeis University  so that completely  blows his theory  out of the water  that we're a bunch  of groups  from the middle  of the country  so we're going  to keep on  hammering him  until he waves  the white flag  and just puts 
[03:14:30]  his own  cease and desist  in  now you heard  his show  honestly  I mean when you  guys were attacking  him  was there a funny  thing  was there anything  funny he said  no it was all  hacky  it was just  absolute garbage  good  did it feel good  as a pest  to know that  you were absolutely  making him want  to strangle somebody  and ruining a show  oh definitely  we were just  murdering this guy  and we will continue  to do so  because he has  nothing better  to do than do  what is it

[03:17:00]  ask us to  call this off  tomorrow  there's just  so much joy  that we can  get out of  this  every little  busy signal  we hear  when we're  trying to  get on his  show  just makes  us giggle  and smile  you can find  this sheer  sense of joy  if you look  on Wackbag  or the other  forums  they enjoy  this  they enjoy  it  you know  what it is  it's almost  like an  interactive  game  for these  people  because  you do  something  and your  results  are right  there for  you to  listen to  and they  can tell  that they're  ruining the  show  that's the 
[03:17:30]  beauty of it  they can tell  they're ruining  the show  that you're  destroying  this guy's  show  and it's  interactive  everything you  do has a  reaction that  you can see  and listen  to  and it's a  lot of fun  for these  guys  you can really  hear the panic  in the screener's  voices  you can really  hear the panic  and they're  scrambling  trying to  find us  yep  the fact that  he admits  arrogantly  that he steals  it makes you  want to spit  in his face  the fact that  he is an  admitted thief  and he thinks  that that's good  enough to give  to his listeners  he has not 
[03:18:00]  enough talent  to create  to be funny  to be off  the cuff  to be any  of those  things  and this  scumbag  brags about  how much  money he makes  and he doesn't  care if he has  two listeners  because he's  getting paid  phony radio  voice and a  thief and he  deserves it  unloosh the  hound  all right guys  well thanks for  taking the time  out of your  filler filled  show  and I can't  wait to talk to  some other people  about this  oh well now  who's next on  your list  well I gotta  talk to Mr.  Phillips right  I gotta be fair 
[03:18:30]  how about Eric  Logan  why don't you  talk to Eric  Logan  and confirm  that he was  actually on that  phone  yeah are you  gonna do that  Jason are you  gonna talk to  Jim if you  talk to Jim  obviously you're  gonna hear lies  he would love  for you to  print his fact  that wasn't  Eric Logan  but please do  some checking  and don't just  print that he  says that Eric  Logan was on  the phone  call Eric  Logan  confirm that it  was him  because I'd  like to see  this asshole  deny when it  shows up even 
[03:19:00]  in you know  your little  paper  we're not  liars though  this guy's a  liar and he's  a fraud  Jason one  other question  yeah  well that paper  my dog won't  be shitting on  this week  I think that  you'd be surprised  those little free  papers you picked  up a lot man  they're in bars  they're in all  these places  people read it  the best thing  when you're on  the road is to  pick up all  those little  papers you look  for escorts  and you see  what's going  on on the  here we go 
[03:19:30]  why don't we  get back to  the Natalia  audio from  Donnie Deutsch's  show  we've got to  play the first  clip again  because we did  it like a  half hour ago  what did she  say in the  first show  first clip  you could have  played it a  minute ago  I wasn't  listening  here's the  lady of the  evening that  Jimmy banged  now this  company's in  deep trouble  and went down  on  well you had  the girlfriend  experience  with her  GFE baby  and well now  NY Confidential  is no longer  happening  and the owner 
[03:20:00]  is in Rikers  and it's a really  big story  here in New York  and Natalia  who was with  little Jimmy  Norton  ended up  on Donnie  Deutsch's  show on TV  and we got  audio  New York  Confidential  basically this  was a website  and guys  would go to  the website  and what  would they find  they would  see pictures  of all the  girls  who worked  for the  agency  and their name  you know  their age  description of  them  and then  they could  call and trade  and was it  does it give  like how much 
[03:20:30]  you cost  or how does it  because you can't  on the internet  say oh by the way  you can pay for sex  so how is it  worth it  and that's not  what the agency  was about  that whole girlfriend  experience thing  is about spending  multiple hours  with someone  basically like  having a real date  why the fuck  would you rat out  your whole operation  even if it's for  publicity  well she's not  Jason's the one  who came out  she's just being interviewed  Jason's the one  who was coming out  and saying  that this is what it is  well would she be  like isn't she  an accessory  to this whole thing 
[03:21:00]  now that it's been  blown up  and the authorities  have their noses in it  like little Jimmy Noren  had his nose  in the pussy  right  Jimmy knows all  you gotta catch him  in the act  I think so  she can just say  it's for shaw  or whatever  right right  all right here  she talks about  married guys  what percentage  of men that you  were with  would you say  were married  um  more than half  more than half  or most than  happily married  um  some yes  some no  I don't  but even a happily  married man 
[03:21:30]  who come to you  talk about his  happy marriage  absolutely  then  why would you say  then a guy  who was happily married  was paying  two thousand dollars  an hour  for an escort  because  sometimes people just  need or want  something else  or something different  or  and  I think  I mean Jason  used to say  and at first  I didn't really believe  or  I didn't really buy  what he was saying  he would  talk about how  you know he actually 
[03:22:00]  saves marriages  and  going with an escort  can save your marriage  because  because  rather than  going and having  affair with your secretary  or  or doing something  that might really  damage  your relationship  or your family  this is sort of  a little vacation  you go  you have your short term  you know  relationship  and then  and then you both  walk away  little vacation  it's an hour  and it costs more  than first class  airfare  it's a very expensive  little vacation  the European vacation 
[03:22:30]  pretty much  you can save your marriage  by spending your child's  college money  an orgasm  you were making  a million and a half dollars a year  well that's how much  my bookings brought in  for the agency  and how much would you  personally get out of  the million and a half  the way the agency works  and the way most of them work  is the girls receive  45%  the agency receives  45%  and then the booking agent  receives 10  booking agent  slash pimp  yeah 
[03:23:00]  who would be the  booking agent  I don't know  probably Jason  but then again  he also owned the agency  but I thought he yeah  my thing is this  why would you  that's the only thing  you got to be careful of  is for tax reasons  you got to watch  what you say  with money  yeah  and believe me  I mean I don't care  I mean look  I pulled in $8,000  last year  and I don't care  who knows it  I'm happy to talk about it  I want to make it  perfectly clear  that we pay XM  to do this show  it's unfortunate  but that's what  we have to do  how great would that be  so it's just a big  write off  we were exposed  let's go to Sean 
[03:23:30]  in Jersey  Sean  hey guys  listen Jimmy  I got to ask you a question  my impression  of girlfriend experience  is it multiple hours  girlfriend experience  is supposed to be  BBBJ  like kissing  and like the girlfriend experience  not multiple hours  I don't know how  she's talking about  I think  do you have to realize too  I think she's on television  so she's saying  I mean again  a lot of times  a girlfriend experience  can include dinner  a whole date thing  but I also think  she has to be  a little selective  about what she says  just again  for legal reasons  she can't go on TV  and go bareback blowjob  you know  I mean  that's what I'm thinking 
[03:24:00]  when I hear GFV  I think the same thing you do  just kissing  and hugging  and getting to know each other  and talking about your folks  and getting married  and falling in love  and having a little babushka  there was one time  when I was actually  I didn't know this beforehand  but the gentleman  that I went to see  was a lord  a British lord  and I looked at his credit card  and I went  wow  resistant  I thought maybe  it was like  one of my old gang members  that's all we have on that 
[03:24:30]  but lords  I didn't know  Henry Winkler  blew a load all over me  see that  yo  that's why  you see  you see a hook up  on the street  like you go to 23rd and 12th  you know what I mean  and she working the street  and shit  and she hustling  you know what I mean  but then there's all these  other little download places  there's phone numbers  you get like  my boy used to live  right there  on  right there  like when you get off  the 59th street bridge  oh the bridge bottom  yeah 
[03:25:00]  Madam Jenny  she used to live upstairs  we used to smoke weed  with her all the time  son  she got caught  yeah  yo I'm telling you dude  motherfuckers in Armani suits  big Benz  big body Benz  is way in outside  well you know  well she had  she stole a couple of apartments  and had the hookers up in there  that shit made the papers too  as a matter of fact  she got caught  a couple of months ago  it's a shame  you know what I mean  I mean  they should just  I don't know man  don't legalize it  I mean come on man  they should legalize it  yeah why not 
[03:25:30]  Natalia is wonderful  tax the shit  fuck it  new revenue  we should talk about  Paisano before we go to break  Paisano over the street  yo Joe  Joe is still rocking bro  he's a real  true friend of the show  a true friend of the show  he pulled out all his advertising  when we got fired  immediately  good  his business suffered  just to show that he's a friend of ours  but he's back now  advertising on XM Satellite Radio  he's a friend of ours Ope  he's a friend of mine  what  what  just that's terminology  oh

[03:32:30]  cancel two appointments  and forward my phone calls  just so I could  participate in the  slaughter  loving it  see  somebody's radio's  career is just  about to be over  buddy  you know what it is  his arrogance  he's an arrogant  normally these attacks  will last for a day  day and a half  and they're not as intense  guys just have fun  but there was something  about listening to this guy  it just made you  feel with rage  you could just see  what an arrogant  jerk  like when Lex and Terry  we had problems with  they were firing back 
[03:33:00]  things that were pretty funny  we were firing things  it was like  we were just  bitching at each other  but a guy like this  is a no talent  arrogant thief  and that is just  he could have gotten  himself off the hook  in an hour  he could have done it  if handled properly  he could have just  slammed you  hey dicks  it's the media  we can all talk  there's a way to do that  but that cocky  arrogant  we're funnier  we're more clever  more witty  you won't get me  you're not gonna get me  we can't be pushed around  we can't be pushed around 
[03:33:30]  we're gonna be here  we're taking it  yeah  sure you are  have fun today  you just got slapped  by a satellite  circling the earth  motherfucker  yo kid  we got satellites  and shit  we got  yo b we up in space  and shit  for real  yo what's up  can we go up in that  motherfucker  we're taking the next  space shuttle up there  check out the headquarters  shit I'll be alright  with that  this can't be  is this a real story 
[03:34:00]  yes I believe it is  stop it  get the fuck out of here  is this real  this is like  one of the oldest comedy bits  ever  talking about hurricane names  and stuff  oh  what are they up to  but there's an actual politician  getting involved  is this real  representative  Sheila Jackson Lee  democrat from Texas  yeehaw  apparently is  angry  that the names  of hurricanes  are too  and I quote  lily white  she's seeking to have 
[03:34:30]  a better representation  of names reflecting  african americans  or other ethnic groups  yeah  do you  the fact that they are  just doing  completely pointless  destruction  is the african american  angle  a sampling of  popular names  could include  uh  keisha  jamal  dashawn  according to the paper  and the press will be out there  uh  I don't know  it looked it really bad  uh  I'm not sure 
[03:35:00]  the wind was hopping  and hollering  I don't want to be  skinned it alive  out here  it's been a bad month  for hurricanes  oh  this motherfucker  is blowing shit  all over  back to you  in the studio  B  is this real  this is turning this shit  into a ghetto  there's nothing better to do  world net daily  brewing swirl of dissent  black hurricane names  uh  and apparently  I guess  rush limbaugh  was ripping this congresswoman's call  for these african american  storm monikers 
[03:35:30]  to lily white  you know  you fucking  crackers  get over on some shit  wasn't rush limbaugh  busted  fucking buying  all these prescription  fucking drugs  and he still got  a motherfucking job  OJ's innocent  quote unquote  yeah  and he can't get a  well Michael Jackson  fucks kids  he's doing fine  how about R. Kelly  this video of him  urinating on a 14 year old  he's selling out the garden  you've seen that one right  yeah it was hot  you can be sure  one reader wrote  in a letter 
[03:36:00]  you can be sure  that uh  if there were too many  black names  assigned to hurricanes  this congresswoman  would be  instead complaining  that this practice  unfairly stereotypes  blacks as violent  well some motherfuckers  could be violent  as hurricanes  another Greg Cook  his name is  what a coincidence  says this is ridiculous  how about uh  naming the storms  after gang members  or infamous criminals  how about not having  any names at all  associated with hurricanes  yeah so uh 
[03:36:30]  people are saying  this is ridiculous  and it is ridiculous  what does she want  representation  in the hurricane  naming community  stop  that's good again  that she's not worried  about terrorism  or Islam  she's worried about  hurricanes  how about the fact  that um  maybe you should be  looking at the fact  that Jamal  is killing Deshawn  on the streets  you know what I mean  and uh  Keisha was an  innocent bystander  being killed by uh  uh bullets  fired by Deshawn  while being pregnant  with her 15th kid 
[03:37:00]  that's right  Keisha  Keisha just threw  her baby in the  fucking garbage can  cause she didn't  want to support her  yeah maybe that's  an issue you should  really be delving into  that's right  better trash pickup  yo where's the  fucking bell  this is democrat  this is satellite  we don't need to  do the bell as much  alright  fuck the bell  fuck the bell yo  democrat  sheila jackson  wants black  hurricane names  hillary clinton's  going after video  games  chuck schumer  wants cousin  brucey to keep  his job  i gotta say  that uh  not that the 
[03:37:30]  republicans are  alright they're  not but the  democrats can you  please pick  battles that we  give a shit about  please  meanwhile they just  showed a picture  of a suspected  bomber that left a  bomb on the bus  in london  they had a clear  picture of him  walking off of  the bus  and uh we're not  profiling uh as  we're searching bags  in the subway stations  yet this guy sure  didn't look asian to  me  didn't look black  certainly wasn't a  white guy  he was a young  middle eastern man  or a man of 
[03:38:00]  middle eastern  descent  he's a pecky  we got audio of  this uh  isn't that  they call that  motherfucker right  there  we got audio of  the congresswoman  and he's wearing  a new york shirt  new york shirt  great  that's ironic  we got audio of  the congresswoman  talking about  oh we do  yeah the dumb  fucking crap  i'd like to hear it  well be sure  and get pet battle  my condolences  i'm a beaten man  i'm a beaten man  ah there's another one 
[03:38:30]  that's the motherfucker  that served me my  falafel on fucking  six and twenty  thirty  he looks like louis tiont  there's another young  law abiding gentleman  well at least they're  handling the big issues  hurricanes and video games  and uh...  and it's all  politics  it's all politicians  that do this  agreed  i'm just saying  lately  it's all politicians  that are just  publicity whores  they look for these  dumb things that the  press will pick up on  and run with 
[03:39:00]  and then they get  their name out  you're right  but it just seems  like lately the  democrats have been  taking these  these non-issues  and they're not  doing anything  that i particularly  care about  which is crime  and terrorism  those are the main  things  and i don't see  them doing anything  that's making me  go hey man  i'm really glad  you're at least  doing that  although how scary  would hurricane  pat battle be  wheeling up the coast  wreaking havoc  a dark hurricane  with a big awful  blonde wig on  it  well that's why  they don't got  black names  because hurricanes  is white  you ever see them  from the satellite  and shit  they're fucking  massive white clouds 
[03:39:30]  meteorologist od  therefore the name  should reflect  the color of the  hurricane  right  that's right  i was just  talking to  pat battle  pat battle  they would name  them asian  but then again  they wouldn't  know if they  were hurricanes  or calm days  tsunamis  yeah the eye  looks kind of  slanted right  then you get  the eye of the  hurricane  is two feet  wide  and three miles  long  slanted  what are 
[03:40:00]  the recent  hurricane names  emily  lily white  was it  emily  one of them  no  what are we  up to  maybe cd  danny  oh you got  them  what are they  what are they  some of the  ones we've had  so far  2005 we  started with  arlene  arlene is a  very white  name  and it used  to be all  female names  and then they  had to be  politically  correct  i kind of  like just  having the  female names  of course  arlene which  is an old  lady's name 
[03:40:30]  bret  bret  my brother's  name  that's a  white name  that's crack  cindy  cindy's a  whitey name  dennis  dennis  hurricane dennis  emily  came in with  a sweater  tied around  its shoulders  do you really  want hurricane  rufus  rufus  they didn't say  black names  from the 30s  how about that  hurricane  stamp and  fetch it  how about that  hurricane  kunta  blowing through  the carolinas  how do you  like that  silly 
[03:41:00]  franklin  all right  franklin's a  black name  it sure is  here's one  that'll get a  chuckle  another old  lady's name  gert  gert  hurricane  gert  he's blowing  like she did  when the  kaiser was in  charge  like a giant  diaper spinning  just shit  and piss  and forgotten  memories  flung all over  the state  my god  it's unrecognizable  family members  are being thrown  all over the yard  hurricane  gertie's track  who's gonna leave  their home  when they know 
[03:41:30]  hurricane  where it was  on the way  jesus  it has no idea  where it's been  or where it's  going  hurricane gert  can't get anybody  to acknowledge it  or talk to it  it's a burden  of a hurricane  hurricane gert's  complaining its  family never visits  according to  hurricane gert  it's chilly again  hurricane gert's  surgery or dee 
[03:42:00]  hurricane gert's  hurricane gert's  hurricane gertänt  a-ro-recand  You're so fat.  I got a Hurricane Shirley bigger than you.  Hurricane Irene.  Irene?  Hurricane Jose.  There you go.  A little representation.  A little Hurricane Irene from a movie Good Night, Irene.  Hurricane Jose does no damage, but hubcaps are blown off.  Hurricane Katrina.  Katrina.  Hurricane Lee.  Hurricane Maria.  Hurricane Nate. 
[03:42:30]  That's a black man.  I would call it Hurricane Fan, though.  Yeah.  Hurricane Ophelia.  Ophelia.  That's going to be the worst one.  Hurricane Felipe.  All right, that's an ethnic name.  And then it goes with Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince, and Wilma.  Wilma?  But they never get to the W1, do they?  Nah, that's pretty rough to get down.  That's a hell of a hurricane season they get down there.  And then what do they got to start over, right?  And then they go to 06. 
[03:43:00]  They got mapped them out.  They got names for the next, who does this shit?  But if they get down to the last one and they run out of names, don't they got to go  back to A again?  Yeah.  Or do they dip into 2006?  They might have to dip.  I have no idea.  I'm going to have to research.  Might have to go with that dip thing.  You're in deep shit, though.  If you have Hurricane Yolanda and then Hurricane Zeppelin, you've had a shitty hurricane season.  All right.  If they want a black hurricane name, we'll give them one right after Hurricane Mary.
