<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, broadcasting live from Philadelphia, was a whirlwind of events stemming from Jim Norton's sold-out comedy show. The broadcast began with the hosts recounting their experience at Wing Bowl, describing the massive crowds, excessive alcohol consumption, strippers, and general debauchery.  They then detailed their visit to the Mutter Museum, vividly describing the disturbing exhibits, including pickled fetuses, diseased organs, and a preserved colon, with Jim Norton's reactions providing much of the comedic fodder.  This segment included a near-confrontation with a woman ranting about Jesus outside the museum.

The bulk of the show centered around the "Naughty Nighty" contest, attracting numerous women to the studio, many submitting photos and appearing in person.  Guests in the studio included Jim Norton, Jimmy Schubert, Keith Robinson, and Jimmy Schumer.  A significant portion involved sexually explicit conversations and jokes, often using vulgar and offensive terms,  with repeated references to female anatomy and sexual acts.  The hosts engaged in suggestive banter with the contestants and took numerous photos. A detailed, graphic, and comedic description of a sexual technique, employing invented euphemisms, dominated a considerable segment.  Discussions ranged from a mummified woman turned into soap to Sam Kinison and Roseanne Barr.  Several callers participated, including one who attempted to replicate a described sexual technique and another who performed a simulated orgasm on air, causing a near-car accident for the listener. A Risque Videos representative appeared with adult films.

The show also featured a recurring segment focused on pornography and sexually explicit material.  The hosts attempted to arrange a police escort for themselves and several women to a hockey game followed by a comedy show.  A prominent segment involved Keisha, a virginal caller interested in losing her virginity on-air with her co-worker, Greg, a scenario the hosts attempted to facilitate.   The show featured numerous calls from listeners, including those participating in a 6 o'clock quiz and contributing to a "What I Learned Today" segment.  The hosts repeatedly emphasized the attractiveness of the "Naughty Nighty" contestants and made numerous sexually charged remarks.  The show also involved an 18-year-old virgin named Rihanna, who was repeatedly questioned about her virginity, and an incident involving Allison's daughter and her friend Rhiannon kissing in front of their mothers. A malfunctioning inflatable Eagles mascot, Swoop, added to the chaotic atmosphere.  Discussions regarding the security differences between their Philadelphia and New York studios, along with repeated jokes about Tim Sabian's Black Sabbath poster, peppered the broadcast.  The show concluded with more contestants joining the "Naughty Nighty" contest and further sexually explicit discussions and plans to visit Cheerleaders club after an indoor lacrosse game.  The hosts also mentioned their expectations for a guest named Keisha, an “African princess” considering losing her virginity live on-air, and the Stress Factory.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Caram Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a place than listening to those two.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi man, this is going to be a long ass day.  Thank you.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Broadcasting live from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Anthony.  Yes.  We're in the WISB studios. 
[00:00:30]  Always opened up to us here.  Isn't this great?  Tim helping us out.  Like a proud papa.  Look at him.  He's all proud right behind you right now.  I know.  And my shoulder, as a matter of fact.  Not too nerve-wracking.  I got to tell everyone something right off the bat.  Tim Sabian is not wearing slacks today.  No.  So there goes about a half hour of our show.  I know.  It goes very nicely.  That means we're going to have to talk about something else for a half hour.  We're all down here because Jim Norton's got a little gig. 
[00:01:00]  A little gig tonight.  A little thing.  A little gig that's sold out and everyone wants tickets for.  That's what we're down here supporting, Jim Norton.  Is that it?  Look how pathetic we are.  We have no lives.  Jeez.  But this town is drunk today, Anthony.  It's drunk.  That's what I hear.  It's drunk.  My day started at 7.30 in the morning because Mr. Cheerleader over here that's just staring at you  decided to wake me up for what's called the Wing Bowl.  Wing Bowl.  Didn't you notice walking around Philadelphia today that everyone is drunk? 
[00:01:30]  I just thought it was just the way things were on Friday around here.  I thought people just got drunk.  They decided not to go to work today.  Yeah.  There's a huge event down here every year called Wing Bowl.  We went to what?  The First Union Center.  The First Union Center.  There was what?  20,000 people there at least?  17,000.  17,000?  Okay.  18,000 people watching big fat guys eat chicken wings, Anthony.  Eat chicken wings.  Eat chicken wings.  Wing Bowl. 
[00:02:00]  It's a huge event.  Yeah.  No offense to the station across the street.  What?  WIP.  IP that puts on this event and gets no credit for it.  It's become bigger than life.  The news stations and the newspapers down here, they all talk about Wing Bowl.  Yeah.  It's a promotion that these guys came up with and they barely get any credit for it.  They don't even get the credit for it.  It's just called Wing Bowl on TV now.  It's an event that the city itself came up with, but it was this radio station and I guess  it started in a hotel lobby, what, 10 years ago? 
[00:02:30]  Right.  I was getting the whole history today.  Wing Bowl 10.  And now they're up to Wing Bowl.  The whole history, did you?  Yeah.  Well, look at them.  That's exciting for him.  Look at him with his little vest sweater.  Looking very professional today.  So he goes, hey, you want to check out Wing Bowl?  So he wakes me up at 7.30 in the morning.  We go down to the First Union Center and it was just, let's say, close to 20,000 guys  just completely hammered watching big fat guys eat wings.  How about that?  And no offense to the station, like I was saying, I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  Maybe Tim could explain this to us. 
[00:03:00]  I don't get it.  You know?  I don't get it either.  I don't get it.  It's a huge promotion.  Guys eat wings.  Guys eat wings.  Girls.  It's beer.  I don't get it.  It's drunk guys.  Sounds good.  It's great.  It doesn't have to be that deep.  Yeah, it sounds that deep.  That's just what it's about.  I'll tell you.  It has everything that guys do like.  It's strippers, T&A, lots and lots of alcohol, puking, right?  It's everything a guy could ever want.  You've described this show.  I know.  So it's deep.  But these guys, these fat guys, they all have their entourages and they come into the 
[00:03:30]  First Union Center.  They all have their own personal strippers.  They're introduced to the crowd.  The place goes nuts.  Yeah.  And it's a four-hour event and it was fun to be there.  It just gets bigger and bigger every year.  And then people just drink very early in the morning.  I guess they don't even go to bed.  You say that like it's a bad thing.  No, I'm saying that like I understand not going to bed because I didn't.  It's such a big event that what?  People start showing up at the start the night before and they just keep going through the 
[00:04:00]  entire night.  And they end their day at 11 o'clock, 10 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah, the parking lot is packed at 3 in the morning just to get into this cheerleader  center for the wing contest, Anthony.  God damn you people in Philly.  We don't have fun.  You're pretty zany, I'll tell you that.  Pretty zanerific.  So I'm a little tired.  Got it burly.  I had less trouble when I went to Colorado as far as being tired traveling to another 
[00:04:30]  city.  I had to take two planes and the jet lag was involved.  So I'm an hour and a half away from my house here.  It's nothing.  And I'm exhausted.  You look good.  I got here early because we had a field trip planned, which we went on.  To the Mitter Museum.  Yeah, we'll talk about that in a moment or so.  Much better than Ben Franklin's house, by the way.  I tried.  I tried.  It was like Christmas morning for me.  I was all nervous about going to the museum and I couldn't sleep. 
[00:05:00]  I couldn't sleep.  It was a field trip.  It was a field trip.  Yeah, I had my permission slip signed.  Right.  Everything ready.  My lunch all packed.  And I got up.  I left New York at 630, which to me, I swear to you, you know me.  You're in bed maybe two hours at that point.  It's still last night when I'm leaving.  Right.  It's dark out.  It's 630 in the morning.  It's still my last night.  And that's it.  I tried to take a little nap in the hotel earlier.  Well, it wasn't working.  No.  Yeah, it's going to crack the bud. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  I swig that down, figuring, ah, it helps every other problem.  Yeah, it might help my tiredness.  Tim brought us a whole tub of Budweiser today.  Do you?  Or Bud Light?  Is it Bud Light or Budweiser?  What do we got?  Bud Lighters.  Oh, very good.  Wow, that rocks good.  They love Budweiser in Philadelphia, Anthony.  Yes, yes.  And a lot of listeners are showing up outside the WISP studio.  I saw that.  Very cool.  A bunch of people I met at Wing Bowl I invited down here, so we got to get them up in the studio. 
[00:06:00]  Just hammered guys.  Hammered guys.  We do that all the time, by the way.  Well, that's what we do.  Here's what Opie does.  Whenever we're out, or Opie goes out or something, people come up and go, dude, man, you think  sometime I can stop by the studio?  Dude, man, yeah, come on down.  No problem.  They show up at the door.  I never expect them to show up.  There's a, you know, John Smith at the door.  And I was like, who?  John Smith said he met you and stuff.  Oh, get him the F out of here.  No, I'm kidding.  Don't say that.  Because usually they have beer and we invite them down. 
[00:06:30]  Opie's a girl's lipstick on his belly.  You know?  Yeah.  We'll meet him in a little while.  Just a hammered guy.  He recognized me from the show.  I couldn't believe it.  You know, we're down here in Philly.  He's got lipstick.  He's writing Wow in his big beer belly trying to get the girls to flash and stuff.  And the whole crowd in that little section was just, you know, enjoying this guy.  So he said, hey, come down to the station.  Have some beer with us today.  Why not?  Were the guys that we met at the Meter Museum by the Tuberculosis Exhibit, were they down there? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, they're down there.  Oh, God.  We'll have to bring them up as well.  We're just walking through the little maze that is that sick museum.  And a couple of guys, oh, were they?  Yeah, yeah.  What's up, man?  Yeah.  Like, hey, right by the herpes pictures.  That's nice.  We'll talk about that in a few.  And you know how you talk about, you know, me inviting people down to the studio?  You've got to tell the story about Paisanos that one time.  Oh, and you told everybody to come down?  Yeah, Joey is a really good friend of ours, Joey Paisano, you know, on Mulberry Street  there, a fine little restaurant in New York City. 
[00:07:30]  In Little Italy.  We eat there a lot.  After one of our road shows, I decided to walk to Paisanos.  Uh-huh.  And I couldn't say no to any listeners.  Like the retarded Pied Piper.  That's what I was.  Yeah.  No joke.  And about 50 or 60 guys.  It's all guys always for whatever reason.  Always.  And, yeah, 50 or 60 just followed me all the way down to Little Italy.  And Joey's not going to turn anyone away.  I know.  And then all of a sudden, he's panicking with this ridiculous chick like, uh, dude, you 
[00:08:00]  know I take care of you down here and pretty much anyone from the show, but, well, it's  like a $5,000 bill.  Did you actually get generous, Hopi, and tell him Ben would pay?  Yeah.  We worked it out, but it was funny.  Yeah, Dad.  He's pulling all these tables together.  It's a, you know, it's kind of like a nice, relaxed atmosphere like we talk about on the  air.  And we have tables like it's some kind of a buffet.  I never felt bad because every time we go there, the place is packed.  And, um, but after September 11th, you know, it's lower Manhattan. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  So now I feel bad about, you know, no, no, don't bring the extra bread, Joey.  Right.  Save that for your family.  Right.  Like, I feel bad about it.  You want beer?  No, no, save it.  You sell it.  You sell it.  You sell it.  And take this with you.  Don't tell anybody.  I slip a five in his hand.  He's rebounding.  They're all rebounding down there slowly but surely.  Thank goodness.  So, uh, we got lots to do today.  Supposedly a couple girls are already here for the naughty and nighty contest.  You know something?  I will be so disappointed in this city if girls do not represent Philadelphia by coming down 
[00:09:00]  for this contest.  New York, we're getting the girls.  Obviously, we're there.  Right.  On a daily basis.  So it's easier for them.  Cleveland.  We have two girls.  You guys from Cleveland rock.  Because we had a couple of girls from Cleveland.  They don't rock just yet as far as this contest goes.  What's wrong?  Two girls so far.  Dude, how many more than Boston?  How many more than Philly?  Two.  How many more than?  Come on.  Two.  Two.  More girls have showed up from Cleveland than the entire listening audience from Seattle. 
[00:09:30]  You know something?  That ain't even a joke.  Ouch.  And, uh, the girl from yesterday from Cleveland when I saw the pictures, pretty cute.  Wait, but there was a teen girl.  What happened with that, Rick?  Oh, uh, Scott's working on the picture right now.  Oh, okay.  Why?  We're gonna have...  Well, remember the girl late in the show yesterday?  Another teen from Cleveland?  Uh-huh.  They took, uh, Foz up there took her pictures, and I've been looking all day in Tim's office  for the pictures, and they're not up yet.  Another teen girl.  Got to see the latest teen. 
[00:10:00]  Entering the Naughty Nighty contest.  I love what the teens enter, don't you?  Hey, dude, the other city's got to get involved now, though.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, now...  Step up.  Now it's looking a little embarrassing for Boston and Washington especially.  Yeah.  Buffalo.  Yeah.  Supposedly there was a girl going down to the Buffalo station yesterday, and I don't see  the pictures up there.  Yeah.  You know?  You go to opianthony.com.  Here, go back real fast, Ben.  Oh, ho, ho.  No, go right there.  Uh-oh.  Teen Shannon's up from Cleveland, Ant.  Damn it!  Wow!  Go to opianthony.com.  Nice pink number.  Oh, God. 
[00:10:30]  Look at that.  Very nice.  I know I'm gonna have to get there, but you know what's gonna happen?  Cleveland representing.  I think that's the third girl now from Cleveland that is involved with the Naughty Nighty contest.  As Ant checks out the picture, these are the stations that are with us for this contest.  Boston, Cleveland, Buffalo, Washington, Sacramento, and San Francisco.  You can go to those stations, if you have a Naughty Nighty, and get your pictures taken,  and they will send the pictures to us, and we'll put them up on opianthony.com.  And Philly.  So, and Philly, well, Philly today, supposedly there's gonna be 40 girls today alone from Philly. 
[00:11:00]  Is that true, Tim?  Yes.  That's true.  See, Tim wants a Philly girl to win this contest so bad, I'm hearing there's a bunch of ringers coming in today.  Oh, is he setting it up?  A bunch of ringers.  I don't want any of these.  All right.  Well, they better be hot.  Is my phone ringing?  I never do that.  Let me tell you something.  My phone never rings, because it's usually in my office.  There we go.  It's off.  I don't want an ass.  Hey, Teen Shannon. 
[00:11:30]  Teen Shannon looks good, right?  I'm looking at it right now.  She has that runaway look, doesn't she?  Yeah.  Fresh runaway, right off the Greyhound bus from Oklahoma.  She's got a cute face.  Just ready to get railed for money.  No, I'm kidding there.  Teen Shannon.  She looks very, very attractive in the little pink number.  Yeah.  I just thought, we got girls like this coming up?  Nice.  Any teens?  Will Philly give us a teen?  I don't know.  I don't know.  New York has given us a teen.  That's good.  Shannon has given us a couple teens at this point. 
[00:12:00]  Teen.  Always better.  All right.  Always better.  Have we figured out where we're going to take the pictures down here?  We'll do it right over there.  Right over there?  Nice.  Right in the corner, Anthony.  Yeah.  When the girls come in.  You stand in that corner.  I want a chick so young, she belongs in the Muta Museum.  Oh, my God.  I know.  I want to save that whole break after commercials, because we need to sit down and spend some time  with what we saw at the Muta Museum.  I won't get into any details, but I will say it's one of the sickest displays I've ever 
[00:12:30]  seen in my life.  I mean, I don't understand how you make a museum that is just based on looking at dead people.  Yeah.  Dead humans.  Pickled punks.  Pickled punks.  We finally got to see pickled punks live.  Not just one in some dark trailer at an amusement park.  A nice variety of pickled punks.  This is brightly lit.  All different ones.  One pickled punk that didn't have a brain.  Did you go to the gift shop? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Tim Norton went to the gift shop.  There's a gift shop.  Yeah, some of your comments, completely inappropriate, by the way.  I'll have that in a bit.  You sicko.  All right.  Horrified parents.  They have children that go there.  They were there with their parents, you know, because you get a little education and stuff.  And they got to listen to Jim making his comments.  I'll tell you what they were in a little bit.  But the faces on one of the fathers. 
[00:13:30]  Did you see that one guy?  No, I didn't.  When you made your comment?  Horrified.  Horrified.  Horrified.  You're a despicable human being.  Tim, we almost got shot, by the way, leaving the Muta Museum.  You didn't tell us it's in the worst neighborhood in Philly.  Well, you know.  And then we had the crazy lady.  The crazy Jesus lady.  The crazy Jesus lady.  She was screaming.  She sounded like the singer from Disturbed.  Yeah.  She's just walking down the sidewalk going, Arr, Arr, Arr, Arr, Arr. 
[00:14:00]  Jesus.  Jesus is dead.  She's yelling, Jesus is dead.  As loud as she can.  So, I figure I'm going to set her off a little bit, you know.  So, we get in the vehicle.  I go, pull up quick.  I roll the window down.  I go, excuse me, where's Jesus?  Because I just want to lose her effing mind.  Jesus is dead.  She goes, Jesus died on the cross at 33.  I know the history.  Where is he?  I go, why were you screaming? 
[00:14:30]  Jesus died on the cross at 33.  God, I want that.  Arr, Arr.  She didn't lose her mind.  No, she was completely normal at that point.  And I felt like an idiot.  Yeah.  I have to roll the window back.  I go, wow, she was a little more irrational two minutes ago.  Should we throw out the first Naughty Nighty?  Is any of the girls ready?  Oh.  Not yet.  Oh.  They haven't brought them up yet?  No.  I think they're doing all that paperwork.  Man, you think security's bad in New York.  It's ridiculous to get into this building.  Yeah.  It's kind of like an episode of Get Smart to get to the studio. 
[00:15:00]  Got to go through a million security doors.  What do you mean you take my card?  Why?  I don't know.  I have my card changed.  They haven't activated it yet.  I don't know.  Maybe they're trying to tell me something.  Yeah, see, our building in New York, you just got to show them the ID card from the building.  By the way, I still do not have a building ID.  I refuse to give in to the man.  But here, you have to put it in front of a contraption that unlocks the door.  Touchpad.  Yeah.  So you put your little patch thing there.  And it always brings you down to earth when you realize you're nothing but a piece of crap. 
[00:15:30]  Because, I don't know, the guards now in New York pretty much know me.  I can walk in, give a wave, and they let me go.  Here, you know, it's like, oh, you know, O&A, we're broadcasting from YSP, and the security guy,  who are you?  Yeah.  Oh, now I got to, you know, with the show.  What show?  What?  I've never heard of you.  Who?  Oh, right back down.  No badge, nothing.  Listen, I want to take one of your badges and copy it.  You can do that.  For New York.  That's no problem.  And Photoshop, put the little picture there. 
[00:16:00]  I might just put a picture of anybody, Newman, and just flash it, see if I can get away with it.  That's a good idea.  I'm sure.  The security at our building is ridiculous.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  There's no need for it.  Jim, your thoughts of Philly this time around so far?  How are you doing, Jim?  No, it's good, man.  I'm just really tired.  Are you?  I can't sleep well.  Hell yeah, man.  I heard about your...  What?  You and Ben tried to wake him up or something, banged on the door.  No, that was me and Ben.  Yeah.  Banging on his door.  He finally, he's screaming, who is it? 
[00:16:30]  Who is it?  But then he opens the door up, and Ben said that the room, you could tell it was just pitch black.  Like he pulls everything shut.  He's got his Aussie, he's got his Aussie t-shirt on.  And what?  And your boxers?  Yeah.  Disgusting little boxers with little point things sticking through.  Not a little, Rick.  It's just one of those guys that open up the door, and you can just tell it's been pitch  black.  He's like, what?  What?  Who?  What?  What do you want?  What is it?  I should have slept.  Yeah, I shouldn't even have went to that museum, man. 
[00:17:00]  How are you going to do a show tonight?  I'll be fine.  You'll be all pumped up?  Yeah, I'll be fine.  I'll be fine.  That's good.  I'm just tired, man.  We'll be fine.  We're going to have so much fun at the Norton shows tonight.  Yes.  Ben's holding up a note.  What's that?  He said, Jim can't stop farting, which is horrible.  He holds up his coffee early, and he goes, you know what kind of logs this is going  to make come out of me?  You know, I wasn't even going to think about it.  They should make the Jim Norton Museum.  Oh, probably would be more disgusting.  All the byproducts that leave your body, we'll put them in pickled punk jars and charge admission. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, you can make cute little gift shop t-shirts out of it.  It's a $1 donation to open the jar and sniff real quick and then close it.  What did they have?  Rick is the only one that gets it with the gassers.  He's the only guy that gets it.  Everybody else is like, oh my God, don't do that.  No, we get it, but Rick's the only guy.  He knows, man.  That's because I was challenging him in the van.  You can't gass a gass.  You guys are idiots.  We get it.  I don't mind smelling my own.  I don't want to smell another guy's farts ever.  Ever. 
[00:18:00]  Rick just tried to, he just told me he gassed, and I'm waving it up.  There's nothing there.  Oh, God.  Come on.  Get out of here, kid.  It's a little bubble.  He cups his hand and scoops it.  I know.  He really enjoys it.  The full odor.  Every guy does.  Every guy does.  I'm sorry I didn't pick up on when we were at the Mutant Museum.  The Pioneers of Medicine card game in the gift shop.  Did you see that?  No.  With the dust on it.  Who the hell goes, you know, my kids would love the Pioneers of Medicine card game. 
[00:18:30]  There's a card game called the Pioneers of Medicine.  Yeah, the first doctor.  There's a picture of him with a hacksaw and a bottle of whiskey.  Well, that was good.  They showed some of the hacksaws.  You walk in, a lot of history in that place.  They have the doctor's names engraved on the granite walls with the dates next to it.  It's like from the 1700s.  They show some of the instruments they used.  Oof.  Ghastly.  Those are the type of cards like some guy plays solitaire with before he eviscerates  a prostitute.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Sticks similar old style tools and just slips it right up the middle.  Right up the middle like Godfather 2.  Hey, the phone call.  Antonio Andolini.  The phone call is starting to come in.  Look.  Yeah.  Is Sabian wearing his slacks today?  See?  No.  No.  He's not.  Not at all.  I disappointed everybody.  I'm sorry.  You got one of those, Dockers?  I think you're the casual.  It's a whole thing.  No, I think you went out and got those Dockers knowing that we were coming to town.  I'll defend them.  They don't look new. 
[00:19:30]  They don't look new?  Yeah.  It's regular pants and bike.  He's bothered.  You're a legend in Philly.  He's bothered by it.  With your son and his friends.  They all want to go to Tim's.  Hey, where's your dance class?  Can we go up in the closet and go come to the closet?  Oh, God.  Get the album out of here.  Sorry, man.  You know, it happens.  You should ask those kids what do their dads do.  Yeah, right.  You've got to have the coolest job in that circle of friends.  Go up to your dad's closet and look at those slacks.  Dude, where are they? 
[00:20:00]  All right.  Dude, you hang out with Ozzy Osbourne.  Who cares what kind of slacks you wear?  You're the coolest guy I know.  We know.  Brown-nosing Tim Sabian.  I'm not brown-nosing.  Who cares about this Sabbath poster?  I love this guy.  No, I know what he's doing.  I know him very well now.  He's going to kiss your ass until you give him that Black Sabbath poster band.  Oh, that one with the faces signed?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  You eye it every time we're in Philly.  Dude, I would drink out of every mule in this building for that.  It's amazing.  He is...  Wait till the day comes.  It'll happen.  Hold on.  When you meet him. 
[00:20:30]  Hold on.  Yeah.  What would you do for that signed poster?  I'm not doing a contest.  What would I want?  Why not?  We'll do it right to you.  That was close.  Wow.  I was like, where's the dump button here?  There's dump buttons down here.  For that poster, I will...  Let me see.  I know it every mule...  Well, I don't think you can say that.  That'll get back there.  That was nice.  Well, that's more of a treat than a punishment. 
[00:21:00]  I don't want to do that.  I don't understand what you're doing.  Can we put a drive-thru window out front here now?  Yeah.  Then you can do it.  He's done it before.  He's done stuff like that.  All right.  Yeah.  Have your order.  Please drive around.  That'd be $2, please.  He's done some of that balloon knot.  Some of it.  Please.  What else is there?  I love it.  Every guy loves it.  He's...  Remember the ice cube girl?  I'll never forget it.  He had some girl put an ice cube right in her balloon knot.  Two of them.  Two of them.  They popped right out in Norton's mouth, and he's like, mmm, like it was an Italian ice. 
[00:21:30]  One fell out, and then one popped out, and it fell right into my little meat hook, and  I just tossed it into my mouth.  He tossed it right in his mouth.  You don't do anything for the show anymore.  What are you talking about?  Are you going to just have girls smother you?  But you won't, uh...  Dude, I'm more than willing to have a girl tiny in my...  It's not like he's going to, you know, oh, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  How many quarters do you balance on your elbow?  Give you the poster.  I think we can come up with something cool.  Well, you want that poster bed. 
[00:22:00]  We'll put it right in the truck, and we'll drive it right back to New York, man.  Tim doesn't want to give up that poster.  He doesn't want to.  He will not.  He won't.  He doesn't want to cough it up.  No way.  No way.  We'll take our first break.  We're obviously just warming up here.  It's a busy day in Philly.  Yes.  A couple phone numbers in 692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Philadelphia.  Yes.  866-277-4WOW.  Let's not forget Jimmy Schubert's stopping by.  A very funny guy.  Oh, yeah.  Also, Keith Robinson coming by today?  Yeah, he's the guy who's helping out with the show today, right?  Yeah, he's great.  And Keisha. 
[00:22:30]  Remember Keisha, Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  The African princess from Philly that is thinking about losing her virginity live on our show.  Oh, that's right.  We're going to meet her today, and we've got some naughty nighty girls standing by to get  their pictures taken to join the contest.  We've got four already?  No, I said Keisha's four o'clock.  Oh, Keisha will be here at four o'clock.  Great day in Philly.  We've got the drunk guys from Whittington, and when we come back, we'll finally get  into our discussion about the Mute Air Museum.  We saw some sick stuff in just a bit, all right?  Stay there. 
[00:23:00]  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious amusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Shilt and smid.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show to serve the game.  What an angry Jewish gentleman this guy is.  I swear to God, the singer, we saw him live, and look, I'm yelling, we saw him live, Opie! 
[00:23:30]  And, um...  All right, there you go.  Isn't that great?  The guy, like his opening tune, he comes out, and then a bunch of these Nazi guys come out  and shoot him and throw him in a gas chamber.  It's, like, really sick.  That's how he starts the show.  Yeah, he's in this, like, this glass chamber, and this green smoke comes in, and he kind  of, like, dies there inside the thing, and then busts out of it and just goes crazy. 
[00:24:00]  He, uh...  The whole stage set looks like, uh, some kind of concentration camp, barbed wire bricks,  bullet holes in it.  He was in the Israeli army, yeah.  And there you know, those guys are serious.  You set off one bomb over there in Israel, and they come by, like, jets and helicopters  and blow up every office building associated with the people they think might have done  it.  Fantastic way to deal with their problem.  That's how it should be done.  Ah, absolutely.  I'm not kidding.  I love that.  All right.  I really love that.  Jim Norton in the studio. 
[00:24:30]  The whole reason why we came down to Philly this time around.  Yeah.  We're always looking for excuses to come down to Philly.  We're broadcasting live.  And, uh, Jimmy Schubert in the studio, Anthony.  Jim Schubert.  Hey, guys.  He's been on our show a bunch of times.  He's playing the Stress Factory all this weekend, tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  Damn guy toured with Sam Kinison.  Yeah.  Mr. Kinison.  Yeah.  This will actually be ten years coming up.  He'll be, uh, he won't be.  Ten years.  Ten year anniversary of his death.  And I get the lucky seat and I sit next to Jim Norton, who's over here farting like  a circus elf.  Isn't that disgusting, man? 
[00:25:00]  I bet his underwear looks like a high school parking lot by then.  Yeah, man.  Dude.  So you don't mind smelling his farts?  We hate it.  He doesn't tuss all the time.  He thinks it's funny.  It's a code of men.  Yeah.  No, I've never gotten that part of it.  All right, man.  I've never gotten that part of the camaraderie of men.  Yeah.  Come on, smell my gases.  It's one man burying his nose in the cheeks of another.  I can understand sharing a hooker, but smelling each other's farts.  No.  Yeah.  Do both.  At the same time. 
[00:25:30]  I hope he just lost his coffee on the board, I think.  Would you spit out your phone?  Wouldn't be the show if I wasn't wrecking a board.  Studios all across the country.  Right.  You plan to ruin everyone.  You know, Jimmy Schubert was just telling me before we went back on the air that we indirectly  got him in trouble with his mom.  Oh, you guys got me in trouble, yeah.  With your mom?  Yeah.  Well, you guys did, but, you know, Jay Moore was on...  But you look old enough where that shouldn't be a problem.  No, it never goes away.  What disturbed me was the details she knew about the incident. 
[00:26:00]  Because Jay Moore came on, he was talking about, you know, we were in Go Together, he  talked about a story where we went off and smoked a doobie with one of the other actors.  So he goes on telling that story, and I got flipped out, and I had to, like, you know,  I was hiding in my trailer until I, you know, I came down and he tells a story.  Well, my cousin's a big O&A fan.  They live in Brunswick.  They love you guys.  Cool.  Well, she calls my mom and goes into detail.  Well, my mom, in turn, calls me and starts going, so what's this about you getting high  in a trailer with this other actor and all this, uh...  Oh, yeah, I got to tell you.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you got to turn it up to the other one.  I'm used to staying up.  I thought you talked to me after the other one. 
[00:26:30]  There you go.  But, uh, yeah, so she calls, uh, so she calls me and starts going into detail.  I'm going, uh, that was, I was getting into character.  And you got to be like, how the hell...  It's an acting thing.  I told her, I said, I'm a methadone actor, Mom.  I'm a methadone actor.  It's part of the sketch.  You had to be like, how the hell does she know every little bit about her?  Yeah, I thought, I thought maybe they did a piece in the National Enquirer or something.  She knew all the details.  The mom stuff just doesn't go away.  Like, I hope you say, you're old enough and stuff.  Remember the time when I was still smoking?  Oh, yeah.  I was smoking cigarettes.  And I, like my mother, and it's not so much, you know, what, was she going to ground me?  No, it's not that. 
[00:27:00]  I just don't want to disappoint her, you know?  Yeah, yeah, that's who it is.  And then you got to deal with, you know, oh, is she going to sit down and tell me how she quit  and how I got her to quit and how bad it is and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, uh, I was smoking, but I wouldn't let my mother know.  And, uh...  You're old enough wearing that.  I know, but that's what I'm saying.  It doesn't go away.  And then someone called and goes, eh, man, I saw you with a cigarette.  And so I'm like, no, no, you didn't see that.  Stop it.  Like, all of a sudden, I'm in third grade again.  It was a prop.  It was a prop.  I wasn't smoking, I swear. 
[00:27:30]  But, no, you know, it doesn't go away.  It wasn't my jacket, Mom.  It wasn't my jacket.  You know what, Dan?  You're about the heroin and the man-on-man sex.  She might get, uh...  She gets upset.  It was someone else's jacket, eh?  Right, exactly.  Pretty much.  Come on.  I'm telling you.  It's all my friends.  So, uh, Jim, do you disappoint your mom all the time, or what?  No, she's just happy I'm off drugs.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter from here on in.  You must have been a handful back then, huh?  No, I don't drink. 
[00:28:00]  I don't get high.  She doesn't care what I do now.  It's good.  She's happy.  It's like, Mom, I like prostitutes.  Oh, you.  Oh, you.  So, you have to come home and tell her about the, uh, the hiv.  Yeah, you know.  The high five.  Hey, you look good, though.  You're losing weight.  The ninja.  That's awful.  Hey, Rick, we got Naughty Nights here?  Yeah, about one minute.  They'll be out.  All right, and we're bringing them right in?  And I saw one of them before she got dressed.  Is that right?  Philly representative?  Nice.  I think we're going to have a couple finalists.  All finalists. 
[00:28:30]  You better break out your sponge underpants.  Yeah.  Stop it.  You're not careful.  You wake up with a lot of potato flakes in your tubes the next morning.  Potato flakes.  Dude, I do that now.  Potato flakes.  That's good.  We might have to steal that one, too.  That's really great.  That's really good.  We thought we've heard it all, but no.  How many we got?  Two right now.  Two?  Nice.  Come on, Philly.  No.  Don't worry.  Yeah.  Before the end of this show, we're going to have at least 20 girls in here.  Great. 
[00:29:00]  20 girls joining the Naughty 90 contest from Philadelphia.  Great excuse to see naked women, huh, Jimmy?  Got a lot.  I know.  That's all it is.  It's totally an excuse.  This is like the closest thing to crime I've seen.  Are you kidding me?  This is beautiful.  All right.  All right.  We got to talk about the Muter Museum.  You ever been there?  No, man.  This is the sickest thing.  That kind of stuff gives me the willies, man.  I don't like stuff like that either.  But it was just twisted enough that I had to say it.  Like, I'm not into the death and destruction thing. 
[00:29:30]  As far as the internet goes, I don't like people.  Dude, go to rotten.com and check out people impaled on steaks and stuff.  Yeah.  They had the picture of one guy who jumped from a building.  Yeah.  And a splattered pizza.  Yeah, it looked like a hefty bag full of vegetable soup at the sidewalk.  It was like a torso and like a 50-pound bag of vegetable soup.  Right.  Exactly.  It was a good part of the show.  I'm not into that.  We're doing that Monday.  It's better when you see the live thing.  I mean, I know they got jarred and pickled.  But when you see like a freak live, I got this thing on A&E.  They had this documentary about these conjoined twins.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  It was like the one girl with the midget hanging off her head.  Yeah.  And the one wanted to be a country western singer.  Oh, we talk about that all the time.  And I'm sitting there going, you know, no one had the heart to tell this girl, you know,  you really can't be a country western singer with a midget hanging off your head.  It's not like a mole with a couple of hairs coming out of it.  It's a midget on a stick that you're wheeling around.  So there's no real precedent there that you can go back to and say, well, she made it with  a midget hanging off of her head.  Well, you know what I'm saying?  Maybe I can too.  Well, I'm just saying, if you want to be in show business, it's fine.  Become a ventriloquist, you know?  Go to the borders.  You can get one of them big yellow books, ventriloquism for dummies, and work with the midgets. 
[00:30:30]  Right, right.  But you can't, you know, you can't even get a big 10-gallon hat to hide that midget.  Hey, get in that hat, you midget.  I want to be a country western singer.  You're not going to stop me.  The midget to the head is kicking around.  She's like, all right.  And she's convinced she's getting the gigs because of her singing voice.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, people aren't paying.  That's not the singing voice.  Believe me, this girl couldn't carry a tune if it was connected to the other side of her head.  I saw her and Maury Povich.  Yeah.  Who we just, we've talked about Maury, one of the biggest shysters and fakes.  He tries to make it, he tries to make it come off like he's helping. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, like he's going to give them a recording contract.  Yeah.  We're going to get your girls a recording deal.  Uh-huh.  You know what I love?  But halfway through the special, I'm watching, and the girl goes, well, I like today.  And I's going, well, that's got a complicated thing.  You know, let's say you like the country western, you want to take her out for dinner.  You got to pick up dinner for the midget, too.  I don't mind springing for a plate of cheese sticks.  Here, midget, here's some cheese sticks.  So when did you first get into country western music?  At least Jerry Springer knows what he is. 
[00:31:30]  You know, like the show is trash.  He's not helping anybody.  But Maury had those two on, and he gets that low, sensitive voice and comes over and goes,  so, you got a boyfriend?  Yeah.  And you look, you go, Maury, shut the, just shut up.  Yeah.  There's no way someone's dating that.  Yeah.  You know what I love?  I love to think.  I would love to say, you know what I'd love to say?  I would want to see one of them freaks on the Jerry Springer show.  Just put it in.  Must push him in from a white trash.  Here's one of them freaks just turn around and just pump a couple into Jerry's head 
[00:32:00]  and rupture a skull like a watermelon in a Gallagher show.  Jerry's brains all over the place.  I go, yes!  Now that's going to take you.  Because, I mean, you know, I know he knows what he is, but I still, you know, it just  throws me the wrong way.  I got to thank Jimmy Schubert.  He found the beer.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You give it to an Irish guy.  I would tell you something.  You give it to an Irish guy to find the beer.  No joke.  We couldn't.  We didn't know where the beer was.  I went outside.  I'm looking for it.  Jimmy goes, ah, I already found that two minutes ago.  Yeah, you know, I have an uncle that carries a case of beer in the trunk of his car for 
[00:32:30]  emergencies.  Really?  Yeah.  What kind of emergency would you have if you needed a case of beer?  Hey, we got a flat and no spare.  Let's drink.  Emergency.  The only reason he doesn't have a spare is because he took it out so he could fit the  case of beer in it.  He's an Irishman.  He was sober for 88 days and then he said, I already have a keychain.  Let me kill him.  We went to the Muter Museum.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We like to go on special little field trips when we come down to Philly.  Last time.  Last time sucked.  It was the Ben Franklin house. 
[00:33:00]  Have you ever been there, Jimmy?  You're from Philadelphia, right?  Yeah, I've been to Betsy Ross's house.  Is it better than the Ben Franklin thing?  No.  I noticed.  Is there at least a house at the Betsy Ross?  Yeah, Betsy Ross.  Those people back then were very small.  Yeah.  Because you have to dock and the hallways are narrow and stuff.  Really?  That's where George Washington went over to help her with the flag.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  He was helping her.  Help him with the flag.  Yeah, yeah.  So he told the old lady.  Red, white, blue, whatever you want to do.  Who's the father of the country? 
[00:33:30]  Who's the father of the country?  You dirty little seamstress.  That's where he went over to help her with the flag.  Yeah, right, right.  I've been to Betsy Ross's house.  What were you doing last night, George?  Oh, I was over Betsy's helping with the flag.  Poor Betsy.  Read the autopsy report.  He did an autopsy on her.  Who knew?  Yeah, who knew they were doing that?  Yeah, the Ben Franklin thing sucked.  Apparently his house fell down over time.  But the lot is still there.  And they built like this cement outline of a house. 
[00:34:00]  A frame, yeah.  It's a cement frame of a house.  So it's got the little roof line and the wall line.  Not real walls.  You walk right through it.  It's like, here's where his house used to be.  Who cares?  Yeah.  So we were pissed.  And this time we wanted to do something a little odd.  So we went to the Muter Museum.  The staff around here thinks we're insane.  Yeah.  It's like, why did you want to go to this museum?  No, they said, why are they bringing you here?  No, we want to go here.  They said, we wanted to come here.  I've been hearing about the Muter Museum for years. 
[00:34:30]  Soap lady.  Medical oddities, right.  Medical oddities.  Pickled punks.  You ever see pickled punks?  No, what are they?  They're a deformed fetus in jars of formaldehyde.  Sounds like the name of a rock group.  Pickled punks.  Yeah.  And then they got various diseased appendages that are floating in liquids.  Or Shelton's old liver.  Yeah, things like that. 
[00:35:00]  Cancerous lips.  The gangrene.  Gangrene hand is great.  But it wasn't just a gangrene hand.  What was it called?  A moist.  Moist gangrenous hand.  They called it a moist.  It was a green hand in liquid cut off at the wrist.  You could see the bones sticking out where it was cut off.  And he was flipping somebody to birth.  It was just pickled and it was green.  It was floating.  For a hundred years sitting there flipping off the public.  That's right.  He was angry when he took his hand.  He was an angry man when he took his hand.  The museum is set up in a weird way because as you get further and further into it, it gets worse and worse. 
[00:35:30]  It gets worse and worse.  At first, you're looking at Dante's Inferno.  Yeah.  When you first walk in, you just look at pictures on the wall of old city streets with children that have been quarantined for diphtheria and whatnot.  What certain bacterias look like.  Right.  An x-ray of someone with TB.  Right.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Captivating.  And then you work your way into the bowels of the museum to see, well, the bowels.  They got this big case where this guy had backed up bowels. 
[00:36:00]  His large intestine was the size of...  How big was that thing?  It was eight feet.  It was eight feet long.  Fifteen inches thick.  And fifteen inches thick.  Full of crap.  Wait.  Norton, I think that was Norton's favorite part of the exhibit.  Because I was walking around with Tanya.  That's one big sewer pickle, my friend.  Yeah.  That is one big sewer pickle.  That's disgusting.  You know, the girl, Tanya, she's so hot.  And I'm looking at this like a date.  We're walking around the funeral.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:36:30]  You're trying.  That's his opening.  That's his opening date.  Well, she hadn't seen this.  She's like, I wanted to see the colon.  And I'm like, oh, come on.  I'll show you.  I'll take you.  Yeah, I'm just trying to impress her.  I'm like, you know, there were 40 pounds of stool in there.  She was, oh, she's sexy.  All right.  I thought it was like a date.  Yeah, you know what happened?  We came up after the whole thing, after we saw it.  And she had missed the bowel segment.  And she's like, oh, that's kind of the only thing I wanted to see.  And Jimmy's there, you know. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, Jimmy will take you.  Oh, yeah, come on back downstairs.  Come on, love.  I'll show you.  Come here, beautiful.  And Jimmy helped her out with looking at the bowels.  The sickest thing, when you get way downstairs, there is.  Wait, before you.  I know what you're going to say.  What?  You didn't think the baby thing was sick?  That made me try.  Which baby?  The skeleton of the baby.  Oh, the one that looked like the great kazoo.  It looked like a skeleton of the great kazoo.  It had this giant, big head.  But it still had the tendons. 
[00:37:30]  Dumb-dumbs.  It still had the tendons and the arteries attached to the.  Oh, no, you're talking about.  Oh, you're baby jerky.  We were calling him baby jerky.  Yeah, baby jerky.  It was like a baby skeleton, but it still had some beef on it.  And it was all the veins and arteries and ligaments were dried.  And some meat on the arm looked like beef jerky.  Nice.  It was like dried baby Jesus, just like that.  Yeah.  Jesus is dead.  It was a little baby jerky.  And then the great kazoo skeleton.  Which one was that?  I don't remember.  It was the one at the end of the case.  It had the huge, giant water on the brain head with a big hole cut on the top. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where you gas it up.  Right, right, right.  It was like a big fuel receptacle.  Yeah.  That was some of the early surgery in the 1900s.  Oh, yeah.  They just lopped to take a post hole digger to his head.  Post hole.  We'll fix it.  He's got a little water on the brain.  Where's that post hole digger?  Pulled right through the soft spot.  Ah, we screwed up.  It stopped really.  Wait.  Sorry, we lost him.  We don't have the technology.  Just keep him out in the Saudi so the people don't see him.  Take him to Doc Baker.  That was years ago. 
[00:38:30]  What did they know?  Then you saw some of the skulls that surgery was done on.  And you saw the saw blade marks in the head where they had started the cut.  It's like big square notches cutting people's skulls.  It looked like a tic-tac-toe boy.  Tic-tac-toe on the guy's skull.  It was a little cut out.  Now, the thing that was even sicker than the floating little fetuses in the jars.  The pickled punks.  The pickled punks.  Did you see the one pickled punk that didn't have a skull?  Yeah.  Yeah, it had no brain.  The skull ended right where his eyebrows are?  The skull ended at the eyebrows. 
[00:39:00]  No brain inside its head.  Where does it go?  A little grave somewhere where a mother could grieve for it.  No, in a jar.  So you could go in and see it here in Philly.  Frozen in time.  Well, they found him in a dumpster, you know.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.  Frozen in time, just floating there for eternity.  Yeah, I know.  You have to look at it.  That's the creepiest part of it.  I feel, you know, attached.  I wonder if his soul has gone on or is it?  That's what's just stuck there.  His soul's just stuck in the jar, you know?  Hey, you know something?  I wouldn't want to be there at night with the lights out.  No.  That'd creep me out. 
[00:39:30]  That's a Wes Craven movement right there.  It is.  It's a muter museum.  Little fetus monsters coming at you.  Take off the wood of the drawers.  It didn't bother me, you little pickle fellas.  Little pickles guys.  Speaking of the pickle pumps, Norton pointing out their junk.  Yeah, this is the sickest part.  To the horrifying fathers.  There are parents there with their children trying to give them a little education.  This is what happens if you don't behave yourself, kids.  Exactly.  Norton, in the loudest voice possible, because, you know, I guess you want to have some kind 
[00:40:00]  of respect for the dead.  It's dead.  It's dead.  They're dead.  So, you kind of talk low.  It's like, wow, look at this.  All right.  It says that it's 24 months, and it's got no brain.  Yeah, great.  And Norton's like, gee, look at the mule on this kid.  And the father looks over and is totally disgusted with you.  I couldn't stop giggling at their little pickled mule.  Delicacy in Indonesia.  Yeah, they love it there.  They're just floating, unused, with flares. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, they're floating in that liquid.  It's just awful.  All different deformities.  I'm looking at them.  The one with the big bug eyes, and then they got the one without a jaw.  Pickle Punk, Siamese twins in the jar.  Siamese twins.  Things growing out.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Just sick.  And they were telling that one of them to be born, like, was stillborn or something,  and they had to pull it out with a hook, which is great.  Oh, wow.  The one with the big, huge, what was it, tumor on its butt.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was born with the aid of a blunt hook. 
[00:41:00]  This is great.  That's what it said.  Yeah.  Index card, yeah.  It's like an old vaudeville gig.  Give him the hook.  He flopped at the Apollo.  Little clown guy comes out.  Yeah, awful, awful stuff.  The jerky baby was the thing that almost got it.  Now, here is what I felt was the sickest thing.  The fetuses in the jar is one thing.  I mean, it's pretty twisted, but if you look at it, especially as the law applies,  they're not human, if you ask me. 
[00:41:30]  They have not lived their life.  I know what you're going to say.  Let me bring up one other point.  The thing you're going to say was sicker than the line of baby skeletons.  Yeah, I didn't mind the baby skeletons either.  No, where it's like fetus skeletons starting at two months.  Yeah.  What a baby looks like in the womb, and now they've got a skeleton of it.  How tall was that?  Like five inches tall?  Yeah.  Barely any bone.  It was like a little ligament like a soft-shell crab.  You just pop them in your mouth.  Yeah.  They had them lined up.  Two months, three months, four months, five months, six months, seven months, eight months, 
[00:42:00]  nine months.  The skeleton stuff doesn't really bug me because it's a skeleton.  A fossil.  But when there's a little jerky hanging off the floor.  Right.  A little beef on there.  You're like, ah.  That was creepy.  They haven't picked this.  It hasn't been picked clean.  All right.  The worst thing possible.  A little jerky hands.  Here it is.  It was a human, an older person.  This person looked to me to be, I don't know, somewhere between 30 and 60.  I get it now.  30 and 40 around there. 
[00:42:30]  They took the face and sliced it off.  This was a thick little section of face.  It was a whole head.  Let's say you took a head.  You put it face first on a deli slicer and cut it in sections of about four inches wide.  So the whole face comes off in the first slice.  Then the second slice, you got this cross-section of the brain.  And then the third slice, you got the ears on the side, but it's cut and you can see the  ear canal.  Now, the first section, the face part, is suspended in liquid, just with its eyes half 
[00:43:00]  open and its teeth, you can see it through the open mouth, just floating there for years.  Nice.  Looking out at everybody that moves by.  A slice of face.  It looks like olive loaf.  Hey, how's the tongue?  How's the tongue?  The tongue speaks for itself.  The eyes just kind of staring at you.  The eyes all clouded over.  That's creepy, man.  Can you imagine being there like late at night?  You're going to get a security check and it's just, you know...  Look at this guy's face.  That's creepy, man.  Where's that soul? 
[00:43:30]  I could have even stromboli walking through there and none of it bothers me.  You don't care because you're sick.  None of that bothers me.  You're a sick man, that's why.  With the little midget skeleton, that was kind of funny.  Hilarious.  You see the little midget femur?  It's supposed to be like the longest bone in your body and it looks like something you  got off a chicken wing.  Oh, you had a couple of dwarfism babies?  Yeah, a little dwarf baby thing.  Well, they could have been adults.  Who knows?  We were definitely pleasantly surprised.  Yeah, they had a lot of face casts of various diseases. 
[00:44:00]  Did you see the syphilis lip?  Yeah.  This big, goddamn Betty Boop lip.  And it was all because the person had syphilis.  Just puffed right up real nice.  You guys couldn't get into Independence Hall today?  Exactly.  The declaration and the digestion, you couldn't see this?  We don't want to see that.  We saw, like, Tim Sabian took us to the goddamn Liberty Bell last time we were here.  It's like, ah.  Did you see that guy try to smack the damn thing? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, hit it with a hammer.  Yeah.  I saw his picture.  I guess they rained him.  A couple months ago, a guy tried to wreck it with a sledgehammer.  Pulls out.  Things are already going to crack in it.  Yeah, it don't matter.  He was trying to win tickets to the Jim Norton show tonight.  So anyway, yeah.  Oh, is that what the other contest was?  Yeah, he was trying to win tickets to your show, I think.  He was trying to break the Liberty Bell?  Well, he pulled a sledgehammer and he started saying all kinds of God stuff and started smacking  the Liberty Bell.  And then he ran a picture in the face and I said, someone says, you know this guy?  And I said, no, but his face rings a bell.  I haven't.  I don't know who.  I don't know who. 
[00:45:00]  I don't see.  I don't know who.  I don't know who.  I don't know who.  I don't know who.  I don't know who.  I don't know who.  I don't know who.  545-4242.  525.  Ha ha ha.  Yeah, Jimmy Schumer's going to be at the Stress Factory tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  He's joining us today here in Philly, obviously.  Hey, we got a couple girls that want to do the Naughty Nighty contest.  Nice.  We got to take a break and then we'll get them in here.  Real quick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's get a little preview.

Look at that.  Stay there.  It's Opie Anthony live in Philly.  It's Opie.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, Opie.  Hey, Anthony, stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah.  How's that New Year's resolution to lose weight going?  As you shut my microphone off, Opie.  I'm sorry.

We're playing the stress factory tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  Jimmy, we're going to go see our town north. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, no, you're here in Philly.  It's a good move.  But next time, we'll see you.  Yeah, but if anybody in New Brunswick is back to the week this weekend, we've got some  phones, the girls are just lotioning up each other's asses.  Nice.  That's nice.  Why do you need a little lotion on that ass?  Is it a little dry on that ass?  I'm sure there's plenty of fluids you can find right around here at this very studio.  I'll put some lotion on.  You don't mind if there's a little AIDS in it, do you?  Oh, God. 
[00:48:00]  Norton's lotion comes in its own pump dispenser, too.  That's great.  You've got to moisturize.  Yeah, lotion that up.  Yeah.  Oh, I got something good, ladies.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  Ouch.  They're just rubbing lotion all over you.  Yeah, it's just lotion.  You missed a spot.  Yeah.  Yeah, right there, that spot.  Right there.  Right now, I am acting like a pickled punk.  He's got a pickled punk in his pants.  Thank you.  We've got two beautiful brunettes in the studio.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:48:30]  And they're entering the Naughty Nighty contest, obviously.  Not the only giant head that we saw today at the museum.  Where are you girls from?  I'm from Philadelphia.  Are you guys ringers or just regular girls?  What are you?  Just regular girls.  Yeah, regular girls.  I noticed you girls don't have tan lines, though.  Yeah.  What's that about?  You don't dance?  I dance, yeah.  Sometimes.  Oh.  Sometimes.  Do you want to promote the place?  No, I work at Delilah's.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  The only place. 
[00:49:00]  You came jogging in and your beautiful breasts just came flying out.  Oh, you have?  You've been dancing all morning?  Yeah, I've been there all day.  I came over here to see you guys, and I'm going back.  So, you know, come over.  You know, I enjoy the whole Naughty Nighty thing, the whole thing we've been doing, because  a lot of regular, just regular girls off the street, they come in, the Naughty Nighty.  No, no, I'm saying, and then we say, hey, you know, how about a little wow, a little  flash, and they go, ah, you know, a little shy.  The reason I came down here was because I knew we could be in the nighties and stuff, but 
[00:49:30]  if you dance, you could lose that bustier in two seconds.  Oh, I could go like this and just pop right there.  Oh, I bet you can.  I bet you can.  Double dog, dare you?  I bet.  Double dog, dare you?  She can't do that.  No, she can't.  It won't.  Prove it.  Prove it.  They are natural and beautiful.  Wow.  Soft.  That is something.  Very nice.  It's so funny, because my, it's weird, because my girlfriend's a model, and she had an accident  on Monday.  We were at the hospital.  She was doing a photo shoot, and her ankle bracelet got caught in her earring. 
[00:50:00]  And she fell off a pool table, and we were in the house, and we were all day in Monday.  Yeah, well, I bet she gets better.  You know, but, you know, I see you guys work at Delilah's, which is nice.  In fact, I just want to see one of those MasterCard commercials that reflect the way I use mine.  A night at Delilah's, $278.  Cash advance for an eight ball, $150.  Getting denied credit at the liquor store, a quarter of two in the morning, $0.  Getting some moral magic from a stripper in the bathroom, and not having to discuss my feelings  afterwards, price limit. 
[00:50:30]  You know how desperate guys get at strip clubs, too?  Yes, yes.  And you use your credit card, and you've got to go to the ATM.  It's like, there's a fee of $60 on this $50 withdrawal you're making.  Do you accept?  Beep, yeah.  Of course.  Sure.  Sure I do.  You know how many dancers, kids I put through college?  This kid should be going to Harvard.  Do you ever have a guy, like, do you do lap dances there?  Oh.  Do you ever have a guy do this move? 
[00:51:00]  That's the potato flake move.  That's the potato flake move.  Yes.  I did it once in New Orleans, but I had to stop myself, because I almost had, like, a little  thing happen.  Look at him.  He's so insane.  Are you ladies scared of him?  No, not at all.  I'm a nice guy, right?  Nice person.  He's been a lot worse.  Of course, right?  He's been a lot worse.  I've actually met him out in the hallway.  Yeah?  Yeah, we've met.  I was pleasant to you, right?  Wasn't I nice?  That's no surprise.  Yeah, this figures. 
[00:51:30]  I guarantee you, he was the first one to say hi to you guys.  But no, he's very nice.  He's just waiting for the bathroom, and I'm like, ah, the old chest is available.  Just get on top of this glass table top.  Let her rip.  The old dignity saver.  The old Danny Thomas.  She doesn't even want to touch that one, man.  Yeah.  Would they wow, though?  That's him, man.  Would they wow?  You don't have to wow.  It's crazy.  I was wondering if you would wow, because she won't wow, but what would she wow?  You want what they don't want? 
[00:52:00]  Well, she's kind of.  Wow, that is.  I'm like, well, I'll make her wow.  Yeah, just pull it real fast.  We can flip that down a little, right?  We don't have to.  Show Norton.  He's so.  Wow.  No.  That's why we call it wow.  That bustier makes, like, a nice shelf.  Hey, can we get a peek at the roast beef curtains?  There's no roast beef in this, though.  I'm just joking.  Hopefully.  I'm just joking.  I'm just kidding.  You see the looks you gave me to?  I know.  Well, that's what it looks like.  I'm just saying.  Who are you with? 
[00:52:30]  What?  Who are you with that it looks like that?  Yeah.  It should not look like Fidel Castro's eating a London boy.  It should be, it should be very, like a little cherry stone clam or something.  No, no.  It shouldn't be.  What?  Well, I don't know.  She's mad at you, Jimmy.  She's mad at me.  Well, the last girl I was in, looked like, looked like somebody hit a gorilla in the back  with an axe.  Dude, no.  Is that wrong?  What? 
[00:53:00]  No, I'm kidding, girls.  It's a joke.  I'm a comedian, for God's sake.  Why are you even trying?  I don't know, because I just need to be held.  Is that so wrong?  Get him another beer.  Is that so wrong?  Get the Irish guy another beer.  Oh, look, I think you're going to be held.  Very nice.  Wow.  Don't move.  I think I'm in.  Wow.  I love it.  Jesus.  You know what?  Hi.  Hi.  Isn't that great?  They're beautiful.  Yeah.  Rick, where's the camera?  Hey, do your badge here.  She wants to lose her virginity on the show. 
[00:53:30]  You can make pictures together.  Yeah, of course.  Wow, look at that.  Come on.  Are you kidding me?  Look at this lucky guy.  I don't want to take a picture of that.  Yeah.  Take the picture, Rick.  Go ahead.  Because other people might want one.  Sweet, my God.  Nice.  Thank you, girl.  White, nighty-naughties.  That's all right.  There you go.  I'd love a picture with the lady.  I am stiffer to take a picture with the lady.  Norton, take a seat in that chair there. 
[00:54:00]  Ladies, can you sit in Norton's lap?  Ladies, please, get him in there.  Because I am stiffer to the Pope's conscience right now.  I really, I'm sorry.  Here goes Norton's lap.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, look at that.  It just makes him want to kill.  Kill.  Yeah, look at him.  That was enjoyable there, Norton, wasn't it?  And I got to disagree with you on the little cherry clam thing, man.  You want stuff that, come on.  Dude, I want it to look like the lips of an African pickled punk. 
[00:54:30]  No.  No, dude, he wants a set of beef flaps that can kick up gravel if you run across the parking lot real fast.  See, that is, no, no, you're wrong.  Ladies, let me tell you, right?  Right.  Right, ladies.  No roast beef.  No, no, no.  You did not.  I'm not saying it's necessary, but it's still sexy.  It's not bad.  It's cool.  No, no roast beef, though.  I don't like the roast beef.  I like a kind of a dainty schmoony.  It's got to be.  There should be nothing sticking out.  Well, are you really looking at it when you're, like, hitting it?  Let me tell you something.  Yes.  No, I get down there, and, you know, I like to suck on a thing. 
[00:55:00]  I mean, I like that.  Don't make me show you the Venus butterfly to move right here.  Oh, it's nice.  This is called the...  That's interesting.  Well, yeah, this is called what you do, basically.  I'm going to show you how to do this.  If you want to know what I'm doing with my hands, you take them, you place them together,  and you flip your ring finger over just a ring finger.  Yeah, palm to palm.  Palm to palm.  And now put your ring fingers down.  Put them down, right.  Then you take your pinkies gently, lovingly, caressingly.  Anyway, we might have trouble with this translation of this, because we have a member of the clergy 
[00:55:30]  on the dump button back home.  Well, no, it's okay.  No, no, you know something?  He's not going to dump it.  It's totally...  He probably already has.  No, well...  Here he has.  See, words like the P, the word that starts with a P that you just said for things like  putting something, not outside something, but...  Yeah, yeah.  They don't like that word.  Okay.  Well...  But we know what's happening with the pinky.  Okay.  It's around the...  Say the balloon knot.  Okay.  You take those, and you place them up against the mud whistle. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Okay.  Now, the mud whistle.  Mud whistle.  Right.  New term.  Right against the leather cheerio there.  All right.  Now, you slide the middle fingers into the schmooney.  All right.  If I've got to display where the schmooney is, you do fall gone.  The schmooney.  I can't help you.  All right.  Now, you lock and load.  And now, your pointer fingers...  You move away.  Oh.  You peel back.  You're on a mission here.  You don't need to be hacking through a lot of shrevery.  Wow.  You want to run it like a military operation, in and out, no one gets hurt, with a little bit 
[00:56:30]  of air cover.  Now, so let's review.  I actually...  You take the pinkies.  Right up against the dirt button.  Ladies, have you heard of this?  Into the schmooney.  No.  Yeah.  And here, you just move the roast beef curtains out of the way.  Make it sound so hot.  Very important.  Because that's where you're going to rest your chin.  Stand your ass on your tongue.  Because you're going to be there for a while.  Wow.  Licking and laughing.  Licking and laughing.  That is...  Wow.  Look at you.  Huh?  Huh?  I'm trying it here now.  Huh?  On Jim Norton. 
[00:57:00]  That's fantastic.  Nice.  That's the...  I've got to try that.  Thank you, sweetie.  It's almost like a man with a golden gun pose that you're doing there with your fingers.  And then...  Wow.  All right.  That's a good one.  We'd like to see you.  Are you going to do that in your picture?  Yeah.  I like this.  Yeah.  Just like that.  People know exactly.  How about I do that?  You've got to see what's going on in the car.  I do it.  And you get over and we take the picture?  Yeah.  How about this?  We do one of these.  He's running over there.  How about this? 
[00:57:30]  What are these?  Yeah.  Where's the camera?  Don't take his time.  Rick is over there taking pictures with the girl over there.  The other girl.  What's your name over there?  Bobby.  Bobby.  It's Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Cindy.  Bobby.  Wow.  You don't look like all the Bobbies I knew.  What the hell's going on with me?  Look at that.  Wow.  And this girl knows how to pose.  You enjoy yourself at Hedonism 2.  You are going to have some time.  Billy representing Bobby. 
[00:58:00]  Unbelievable.  Wait until you see these pictures.  They'll be up on opandanthony.com.  Hopefully within an hour.  That's one hell of a cheesesteak.  Let me tell you.  You know something?  I don't know.  I didn't think they'd be able to beat the teen that we had.  One of the teens.  Teen Melanie.  Very nice.  Wow.  I could just scrap looking at that.  I could just.  Could you?  Yeah.  So sexy.  You have, haven't you?  I could.  I mean, right now.  My grandmother's actually listening to the show today.  Is she? 
[00:58:30]  I'm just kidding.  Does she have a naughty nightie?  Maybe she.  Bring her.  Bring grabs down.  You can show her the hand thing.  That's right.  We're doing a new contest.  It's actually terminal cancellation boxing.  The first one to get their wig knocked off.  You are a horror show.  Jesus.  How do you expect to have fine girls like this ever have anything to do with you when you  talk like that?  They've probably been dealing, though.  Look at them.  They don't.  No, he's cute.  He's repulsive.  He's cute.  And you dance sometimes? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  You said, and what do you do?  Why sometimes?  Why only sometimes?  Well, because I'm opening a lounge.  Oh, you're going to be the head muckety-muck, as they say.  Yeah, I have a partner.  That's nice.  And is it going to be a dance club?  No.  Uh-uh.  No?  No, no.  You don't want to deal with that?  You don't want to deal with those bitches, right?  You don't show them that trick, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, show them that trick.  Hey, that's a good trick.  That's great.  You know what I'm saying?  That's all my CDs.  It's so memorable.  Rick is up to 30 pictures with Bobby.  Yeah.  Rick.  Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.  Take your time. 
[00:59:30]  Look at that hiney.  Come on.  Oh, now she's slapping it.  Boy, Philly.  Philly.  God damn you guys, man.  We brought other outfits.  You know, we got other outfits.  Oh!  Other outfits!  You know, that's Philadelphia representing.  And there's another girl here, Rick.  There's another girl here.  Rick doesn't.  Rick's just like, take your time over there.  He thinks he's Herb Ritz.  Look at this.  We call him Rick Guccio.  Yeah, yeah.  Hi, I'm Rick Guccio.  He's like Herb Ritz over there in the corner. 
[01:00:00]  We take your pictures.  You know what?  He likes to think he's such a pro, but they all look like Beaver Shot and Hustler.  That's good, man.  That goddamn...  Remember Beaver Hunt and Hustler?  It's like, this is Amy taken by her friend Brad.  Yeah.  It's just a big...  It looks like an explosion at the meat market.  Yeah.  Down there.  Just a mess of...  Yeah, there's an ass tool taken.  You go, didn't you trim that thing up?  I got to shake.  I got to shake.  It's a big thing.  See, that's beautiful, Rick.  Very nice shot.  Let me see, Rick.  Shut your ass.  Look at that hiney. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  Let's get one for Rick.  Let's do this.  We're going to do one of these.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Norton, grab that mic.  It's the springs that are vibrating.  Yeah.  No one touch the mics because the listeners are losing their minds.  All right.  All right.  Look at Jimmy Schubert.  Oh, he's doing a picture with the...  He's doing the hand thing.  It's kind of like a James Bond little pose.  That is something.  And I like how the man's comfort is in mind with the resting of the chin.  Yeah.  Like that.  The resting of the chin.  I got to think of your neck.  You ever just go so long that you actually, your ears, your ears plug up the next day 
[01:01:00]  because your jaw has just...  Your tongue is too full.  I don't know what happened.  Like your jaw just like hurts.  No, Rick.  I haven't.  You can't talk.  How would happen to you?  I was getting my going last night.  What'd you get?  No.  Little push jaw.  Yeah, no.  Your tongue feels like you ate hot pizza.  You know?  I was just...  Friction or something.  You're not hitting the right spot. 
[01:01:30]  You're way in the bottom.  Oh, stop it.  It's hot there.  Like I'm pulled out of a Porky's movie.  Would you knock it off?  Please.  Very experienced.  I just like the whole rest your chin on the thumb thing.  That's very good.  The man's comfort in mind there.  Hey, is Heather getting her pictures taken?  Yeah, they're just downloading those shots.  Oh, beautiful.  Oh, yeah.  Good job.  We share with our listeners.  Opinality.com.  Can we get these pictures?  How about a costume change? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Costume change.  Costume change.  All right.  Well, you want to take your pictures?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Get her pictures, too.  Yeah, I get the funny pictures.  Sure thing.  The 90-90 contest is on.  You know something?  The other cities are going to have a tough time coming to the table after this.  Mm-hmm.  You know, Cleveland, God bless them.  They came to the table.  A couple of girls stopped down at the studio down there.  The girls are beating the New York girls.  I'll tell you right now.  Boston.  Boston.  Not one chick.  Very disappointed in Boston. 
[01:02:30]  Washington.  Washington.  Well, the three people that are listening, I hope one of them's a girl in D.C.  We're having our troubles with D.C., but we're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to keep your chin up.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Philly, you can't beat this.  No, this is nice.  You girls are great.  We usually lie.  We're not lying today.  You guys are Emily.  What are we going to say?  We're going to listen after we leave, so.  Yeah.  Oh, you know something?  Usually that would make me a little nervous because we'd go, Jesus Christ, the slobs that  just left this studio. 
[01:03:00]  And, you know, we have said that in the past.  So, this time, you're going to leave, and we're just going to talk about what we would  have loved to have done.  Yeah.  And how much we would have paid to do it.  How much you paid in the past for a lot worse.  Sure.  And there goes Heather getting her pain mistakes.  I don't have any children, so you can't pay for them to go to college.  Oh, that's good.  You don't want to ruin that body.  There's a section part we can help you with, though.  I just want to artificially inseminate somebody really bad.  I see a tray of ice cubes. 
[01:03:30]  I'm going to go nuts.  I've got a tray of ice cubes and an eyedropper.  You're in a lot of trouble, lady.  No, I'm kidding.  Just freeze it.  Well, maybe I can.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put it in the freezer.  Put little popsicle sticks in it, like kids with a stick.  You drive around, toss them out, and land in some place, lap it in the frost, and boom,  it's a drive-by pregnancy.  It could happen to anybody.  You don't want to have one of those, like, pickled punk things, though.  Yeah.  You've ruined that up.  Wait, there's a guy trying to do a trick right now.  Oh, really?  Stinky's back in New York.  Stinky, put down TJ.  I want to talk to him real fast. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  TJ, what's up?  I am sitting in my car in the parking lot with my hands together, my ring fingers down,  and I'm going, okay, all right, next thing, yep, yep.  And I'm going, oh, I got it now.  That's right.  You figured out the rule.  I got it now.  And then I'm saying.  And you rest your chin on the thumbs.  And that's when I got it.  When he said the chin on the thumbs, I said, oh, okay, I got it now.  Who are you with?  I only help one guy. 
[01:04:30]  You have helped so many people.  It's amazing.  Sir, are you with anybody?  Are you alone?  Unfortunately, I am alone, Mr. Norris.  Do you know what an ass you must look like?  I said to Rick on the phone, I'm sitting in the parking lot, I'm sitting in the parking  lot, and people are looking at me like, what the F is this idiot doing in his car?  I can't believe I got arrested.  I just pulled over in front of the schoolyard and tried this move I heard on the radio.  You're a genius, Jimmy Schubert. 
[01:05:00]  That's amazing.  You're the Jonas Salk of Oral.  The Jonas Salk of Oral.  You are.  You've helped so many people.  I'm all good.  It's so funny because you don't know if people are going to get it until you do the chin.  Right.  Oh, no, they're calling me crazy.  Let's talk to Adam.  Adam.  Adam.  Let's put Adam down.  A little delay.  We wait for that.  That's all right.  People know how to do it.  I know.  Adam, what's up?  No, I'm kidding, dude.  Talk about the whole Eaton thing.  You like that?  Yeah.  You like Schubert's trick?  I've never tried it. 
[01:05:30]  Where's this guy?  Afghanistan we're talking to him on a video phone?  Oh, man.  I'm in Cleveland, Ohio.  Big fan.  All right, man.  All right, thank you.  We'll try one more, and we might give up on the phones for the whole day.  Rick, why are you sitting now?  Oh, were you just showing her the pose?  You duck.  Oh, and look over there.  Yeah, he's squatting on the stool with his legs spread, and he's kind of like leaning  forward.  Like, do it like this.  Look as sexy as I do right now.  Roman Polanski Jr. over there.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Make her look as sexy.  Well, she doesn't need any help, but I'm going with her anyway, and she's coming with me  if we win.  All right.  There you go.  Is that right?  And look at Tim Sabian.  He had to come back into the stool.  Yeah, Tim.  To make sure everything's okay.  See, now, if two people could win, then maybe we would take some guys from here, but...  Oh, my God.  And they look over at you guys, huh?  No, Jimmy passed me at Schubert.  There's a couple of neurotic, crazy comedians.  Right.  That'll ruin your trip.  Guys, what happened? 
[01:06:30]  Where's Jimmy?  I don't know.  He's in a fetal position underneath the end table, crying like a baby.  What happened?  I just...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I would be for Jim.  Ah, leave the ring on.  Who's looking?  Teach me a lesson, Caligula.  In the name of the Senate, the people of Rome.  Hey, Sticky, let's talk to Bob real fast.  We got more girls outside.  Hey, guys.  I just noticed.  Hey, Bob, what's up?  I want to let you know, I was driving down the highway, testing out that little technique, 
[01:07:00]  and these two girls drove by, and I was leaning forward, had my hands on the steering wheel,  pulled elbows into the inside of the steering wheel.  I actually hit the horn when they were by, and they saw me doing it.  I don't know what they were thinking, but they were just laughing their, you know, what's  off.  Oh, cool.  So that trick's going to help you, or what?  I hope so.  Well, my girlfriend's a couple of states away, so I'm going to have to wait until this weekend,  or next weekend.  Now, remember with the pinkies...  But thanks for the tip, guys. 
[01:07:30]  You guys doing great?  Remember, with the pinkies...  All right, Bob, thanks.  Let me just make an amendment.  Okay.  The pinkies, there is no...  You're not actually making any penetration.  Right, right.  You just like it.  They don't like it.  It could hurt you.  Yeah, it's just a little tickle motion, and that's all you're looking at.  Right, right.  It's an amendment to the thing.  It's like a threat.  Yeah.  It's there, and I'm not afraid to use it.  That's right.  If you get out of line, you make...  It's just a pinky tickle, then.  But if I do something I don't like, there's a double-knuckle punishment on this line. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, because, you know, two like that next to each other at once might be a little much.  Hey, Donald Rumsfeld's hair, where's the pictures?  Donald Rumsfeld's hair.  You give Rick more abuse about his hair touch.  Oh, it's so funny.  I haven't seen anything like that since the 1969 Late, Late, Late Show.  That's like Troy Rumsfeld's hair.  What are you on, Craig?  I'm only kidding, Jack Parr.  It looks fine. 
[01:08:30]  You should be insulting Walter Winchell with that hairdo.  Just the fact that you call it a hairdo.  Who the hell are you, Norton?  A hairdo.  I really suck.  You know something?  I got to go to the beauty parlor.  I guess we don't get to change then, right?  Yes, you don't.  What?  Are you insane?  Go change.  Oh, absolutely.  I thought we were getting thrown away for the girls that are out there.  No.  No.  Oh, no, no, no.  The more the merrier, we say. 
[01:09:00]  Are you kidding me?  We want to see them.  Wait, what time?  Your show's over at 7?  7, yeah.  7, so you're going to come to July afterwards?  After Norton's show, maybe, yeah.  Screw Norton's show.  Oh, yeah, Norton.  I'm not even showing up to that stupid TLA.  I'm going to get a face dance to the electric slide.  You should bring up Jim Norton at the TLA.  That's what you should do.  This would go nice.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  And those outfits.  Yeah.  Imagine you girls walking Jim out in front of hundreds of people. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Come on.  Yeah.  They're thinking about it.  I'm going to bring you out on a little sled, Jim.  Yeah.  Come on.  The whole crowd holding up their hands.  Yeah, like this.  That whole thing, that technique hand thing.  That'll be my show, too.  Yeah.  Me with a toilet seat over my head and a mouth full of loveliness.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We're learning a lot about Jimmy Schubert, who's playing the Stress Factory tonight, tomorrow,  and Sunday.  We're live in Philly.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm hanging with Jim Norton because he's doing his shows tonight.  It's the FLA, right?  Or TLA.  TLA.  TLA, FLA.  Who the hell cares?  It's sold out and we're going to have fun, right?  Yes.  All right.  And we have how many girls outside, Anthony?  Seriously, there's at least another too many for me to count.  All right.  Rick is telling me five more girls that are going to join the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[01:10:30]  That door opened up.  It's a gaggle of guzzlers.  It's a gaggle of guzzlers.  Not only that, but Heather and Bobby have also changed, so it's going to be seven.  Oh, seven.  You've got to bring back Heather and Bobby.  You've got to see their new outfits before we move on to the other girls.  Before we move on to the other girls, yes.  Before we bring in the other, might as well, let's see these outfits.  Look at this.  Heather and Bobby.  Oh, my God.  Holy.  Wow.  I have seen more cotton in the tops of aspirin bottles. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that outfit.  Jeez, ladies.  That's.  What the hell can we say?  There's nothing to say.  I'd stab Jim Norton in the neck right now just to touch it.  And I'd let you.  And I won't use my hands.  I don't want to use my hands.  What do you want to touch?  Oh.  Your stomach.  It's lightning, Billy.  Put a helmet on me and send me towards her stomach.  Oh. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, the lotion.  Where's the lotion?  Oh, the lotion.  It looks a little dry.  Oh, there's the lotion.  Yeah, sure.  Where are you going to rub her lotion?  Look at that rubbing lotion.  There you go.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I'm out of blood.  Oh, look at that.  Yes.  Look at.  Jesus.  Yeah, the butt's all nice and lotion-tough.  I just.  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  Norton's got that two seconds away from a felony look on his face.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's waiting.  It's so hot.  It doesn't even turn me on. 
[01:12:00]  It depresses me.  Oh, does it just to piss you off?  I just want to get one off on the floor and put a bullet in my own head.  I just.  I just want to fight a chuggy load of man-trouter in his drawers and just chewing a large caliber  round.  Is that what you're saying?  Well, this is great.  I guess Rick's going to take some more pictures.  More pictures.  More pictures from.  Yeah.  And we share with our audience.  All these pictures will be up on opianthony.com, right?  Oh.  Of course.  Yeah, I know.  Dean from Risque Videos here.  We'll talk to him in just a bit.  He brought like five girls himself. 
[01:12:30]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Philly representing in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Nice.  600 porn.  God.  He brought 600 porn.  He brought 600 pornos?  Really?  We only need 10 minutes.  I'll tell you.  Yeah.  600 pornos.  You'd watch her like 20 of those and your penis would file a restraining order against  your right hand.  I'm between the band-aids, I'm telling you.  I'm between the band-aids.  Yeah, you don't know the pressures of being a guy, girls. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  All right.  What time is Delilah's open until?  We're open until 2 a.m.  Oh.  You know what?  You know what?  I'll call them right now.  We can stay open for you.  Uh-oh.  You get the VIP treatment.  I'll tell you what.  I wish you had a load of knee cartilage coming out.  Just until I get down and out.  Is that right?  Knee cartilage.  Well, I don't think that made the radio, unfortunately.  What?  Oh, they have a problem with the words. 
[01:13:30]  I'm going to say pleasure.  Oh, okay.  Pleasure myself.  All right.  Let me try it again.  You're brave to try a joke again.  Hey, it's good enough.  Hey, Brett, get the girls in the corner so maybe we can do a radio show.  Can we have some together?  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Sure, sure.  There goes Bobby and Heather.  Together.  You got to see.  Can I draw a trail and get in this wildness?  Bobby's natural D's.  Oh, they're so amazing.  What a great country we live in.  It's the bitches that are bitches. 
[01:14:00]  It's the bitches that are bitches.  You know who that is?  That's Joe Pesci singing this.  No, is it?  Yeah.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  It is.  Yeah.  He did a whole song about this.  We just play it whenever we see something in the news about another guy getting just raked  over the coals by their significant other.  What was the story the other day?  It was just a horror show.  Oh, poor Neil Diamond.  Neil Diamond.  What an idiot this guy is.  He got married again, it seems, to some girl 30 years old. 
[01:14:30]  He's got to wash and wear a tuxedo, I heard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He gets it.  But his first wife raked him over the coals.  His second wife got half of his $300 million in his homes in L.A. and Aspen.  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you, if I was Neil after that, I'd have switched teams.  Yeah.  You think so?  Well, because, you know, I mean, you know, you're Neil Diamond.  You're not going to play.  I love him because I love him.  I mean, you know, they're going to get involved because he's Neil Diamond. 
[01:15:00]  Because he's got a lot of cash.  Yeah, of course he does.  You know, that's the thing you've got to be careful of.  I don't have to worry about that just yet.  No?  No.  Well, I mean, you know, I don't think.  It's like, who said that?  Who was the one that said, you know, you make $30,000, she takes $15,000?  Oh, it's Chris Rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's still bad.  It doesn't matter how much you make.  It's still bad.  It will rake you over the coals.  If you've got $20 in your pocket and she wants $10,  that's still bad. 
[01:15:30]  I mean, you know what I'm saying?  But I'm looking at those two and that's worth half my earnings.  Look at those girls.  Yeah.  If I had one of them for like three years and I had to give up half my money,  so what?  I don't deserve that.  You'd probably be saving yourself money in the end.  I mean, you know.  Some money saving.  It's call out calls.  You know what I mean?  You can save yourself money in the end.  What the hell?  Because you're bigger.  You know, you take her out for dinner and movie,  you're still saving money.  That'd be $300 for around the world to stop in Cleveland. 
[01:16:00]  Hilarious.  Well, we've got a story in the news today.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Stevie Wonder.  This is a great one.  Stevie Wonder is just getting raked over the coal.  Because L.A. in California, California's got like the dumbest law.  They got that palimony thing.  Oh, yeah.  Where if you're even shacking up with a girl, for some reason, California decided that it was a good thing  that if you just live with a girl, you don't even decide to get married,  that you could still get F'd in your A as hard as if you were married with this palimony thing. 
[01:16:30]  So he's with this girl.  They break up.  She wants $30 million.  $30 million to service him.  You know what?  It's good, but it ain't that good.  What?  There's no...  I mean, that's just $30 million for a...  $30 million.  ...for a piece of stinky.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, really, when you break it down, she didn't even cook or clean.  You know, I'm sure she made this stuff.  You just...  I've always said, you know, you want a money value on what she gave, and if she did cook 
[01:17:00]  or clean, let's say, you take with the wages that a cook gets, a maid gets, and a prostitute  gets.  You add it up for the years.  There you go.  Have fun.  It ain't gonna come out to no $30 million.  She wasn't singing and playing the piano.  Yeah.  It was Stevie.  Lil Stevie Wonder.  She wasn't writing the lyrics.  Right.  She made him write a song about her.  He's gonna have a new album about this whole thing.  The bitch that took it off.  Right. 
[01:17:30]  The $30 million that we could rebuild her.  I love the Irish guy.  Like Neil Diamond.  The Irish guy.  And what about the...  Love on the rocks.  She took all my cash.  What about the herpes, Ann?  Oh, that's another thing.  She alleges that Stevie gave her herpes.  She gave her the communicable disease.  And not only that, but he couldn't see either.  Yeah.  And I didn't realize that until I was about six months in.  And that's the other thing.  He deceived me.  Oh, yeah.  He licked my thumb for an hour and asked if I was close. 
[01:18:00]  Maybe she did have to put up with some bad stuff.  Who knows?  He drove me home one night and it was a horrible...  There's nothing this girl could say that would make me think she earned $30 million,  no matter what she did, to Stevie Wonder.  I don't get it.  I don't get where this comes from.  Well, I think it comes from that women have toppled every empire since the beginning of time.  Yeah.  Right. 
[01:18:30]  Look at that.  You'll see another one toppling.  No, Adam and...  It's going to be called Rick's marriage.  All the way back to Adam and Eve.  All the way back to Adam and Eve.  Yeah.  Hey, this is great apple pie, Eve.  Where'd you get the apple?  It's the bitches that'll get you.  From the tree with the eviction notice on it.  So you get the apples.  This is good stuff.  Yeah.  Look at what they're doing now.  I love how Rick arranges the girls in the corner.  Good job, Rick.  Look, watch, watch.  Okay, now do this.  Now do this.  Oh, no.  Oh, I really do have to touch your leg.  Hey, just check your corn chute up a little higher. 
[01:19:00]  There you go.  There you go.  Now you put your hand on her turd cutter.  All right.  Now move in.  Hey, it's Siamese strippers.  Less pictures taken during the first moon landing than how many Rick has taken already.  Yeah, that's great.  My family photo albums don't have this many pictures.  What are you working for, Kodak?  Rick, Jimmy Schubert's killing today.  Yeah, having fun, man.  Playing the Stress Factory all weekend long, man. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Hey, you want to bring in some new girls?  Let's bring in some fresh meat.  After Rick gets done with these horses, these two, all right?  God, Rick, this guy, Rick, works the room like a rapist.  We got some rock in the corner and nobody else can.  Where's my legs?  I want to rub lotion.  I want to touch.  I want to squeeze.  He's back over there rubbing one out.  All right, hold it right there.  Ladies, you're not leaving, are you?  We're going to hang out for a bit?  You're down.  You're not leaving, are you?  No, come over here, girls.  And you sit with me while we judge you and the girls.  Can we?  Come on over here and you get over here with the Irish guy.  The crazy Irish guy.  Where? 
[01:20:00]  Ouch.  Jimmy loves you.  Sit with Jimmy Norton.  All right, Jimmy Norton.  You get Jimmy.  You go over here with Jimmy.  Jimmy loves you.  No, this is motivation.  There you go, Jimmy.  There you go, Jim.  Sit down.  Nice.  Now whisper things in their ears.  Useless for the rest of the show again.  Yeah, I can't handle it when there's a girl touching me.  Is there a relation on you?  Where do you want to rub it?  You know what, Jimmy Schubert's going to be doing?  They're not as pretty as you are.  Oh, my God.  She's lotioned up her hand and she's rubbing Norton's chest.  This is the second pair of D's you've rubbed today.  I really... 
[01:20:30]  I'm a disgusting...  Jimmy, show him you're fat.  Show him you're fat.  No, I got no shot as it is.  I mean, I'm hoping that one of them will get really drunk and like, all right, why not?  You got personality.  Oh, rubbing his head and chest.  Look at that.  That's wonderful.  Hey, can we get more lotion in here?  Oh, you brought your own, right?  Jim's making some of his own clear lotion.  Let me...  Let me...  It's going so pink. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, let's bring in the girls from Risky Video.  Bring in these other girls.  Let's see what they're going.  Here we go.  Five more, Anthony.  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  Hey, ladies.  Hey, ladies.  What's up, girls?  Wow.  Wow.  How are you?  Gifts.  Gifts, yes.  I'm bearing gifts.  Wow.  What the hell have you got there?  The videos?  We've got lots of...  Videos?  Videos from RiskyVideo.com.  Wow. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, look at this one.  Scum Horse on Sunset.  Okay.  I got that one, too.  We got two.  Boy, they've run out of titles.  They've officially run out of porno titles.  It's Bachman Turner Over and Drive.  All right.  Very creative.  That's part of Anal Maniacs 2.  Because there were so many unanswered questions in one.  I'm glad they came out with the second one.  I wanted to know what happened.  You know, Michael took the family over. 
[01:22:00]  Does he ever wipe the corn off his mule?  What happened?  This one's called Stretch My Raisin Hole.  What else they got there?  Ah, Babble on Nights.  That's...  Wow, there you go.  Happy ending.  Who doesn't like the happy ending?  We're going to reach around.  Happy release.  This one's our favorite because we have like a little love triangle over here.  Oh, look at that.  We are fond of this one.  The holy trinity.  No, are you...  Where's the one with the...  Are you girls in these? 
[01:22:30]  No.  No.  We wish we were.  Oh.  You want to make one?  We got a camera.  Huh?  Come on.  Let's do it easy.  Teaser.  Wow.  Perfect pink.  Wow.  Perfections.  And look how purr's spelt like a cat.  Purr.  There you go.  That's clever.  So, please, just remember that we can get all these videos and more at risquevideo.com.  Oh, yeah.  Very sharp.  We're getting that website out.  Why do you spell risque?  That's been like nine plugs in like two seconds.  R-S-Q-E.  Yeah, this is not the brightest listening audience.  I tried R-I-S-K-E.  There's no chicks. 
[01:23:00]  Well, that's good.  Wow, you're a leggy one, aren't you?  She's got a little, like, high heels all laced up there.  She's got the whole little lace.  There you go.  Very nice.  What are you, like, ten?  I'm kidding, of course.  Did she say yes?  She looks very young.  That's the best part about me.  That is just wrong.  That's horrible.  Jimmy will tell you that's not true.  Well, that's why I always go for the back. 
[01:23:30]  I didn't start this one, Ken.  No, but I...  No, but it...  You've got to be careful even if you're going in the back, though.  Not to get pregnant.  What are you, insane?  No.  Well, where do you think lawyers come from?  Oh, there you go.  Is that wrong?  All right, hold on.  Well, let's get the girls to the corner.  All right, girls.  Line up.  Rick going to take some pictures, and then I'll pop you up there. 
[01:24:00]  Very nice.  That's good.  Oh, you go first?  Who goes first?  These are great.  This is good for our porno collection at work.  Because we have three shelves lined with boxes just like this, but they're empty.  Because people are wise guys at work.  They take the videos out.  Are you working at North?  Jim, we're going to commercials, too.  What's going on?  No, we met before.  We met before.  Guys, hold on.  Body glitter alert.  Body glitter alert.  Uh-oh. 
[01:24:30]  Be very careful around the body glitter.  What?  It does not come off.  Let me see it.  We've got some down there, too.  It's gold body glitter.  That will glimmer in a girlfriend or wife's eye the second you walk through the door like a phaser shot out of the Enterprise.  You'll come walking in like a sparkless water truck and she'll know what happens.  Exactly.  I understand.  But see, the guys at work, they take the dirty video out and they put, like, Lady Bugs 2 in there and put it back on the shelf.  Right.  At work, these things have just been ransacked. 
[01:25:00]  So now we've got some new adult videos.  Thanks.  That's great.  Look at that.  That body glitter, though?  Yeah.  When you drink a Coors Light bottle, there's sparkles that come off on your hand.  Yeah.  There's an excuse, man.  That is a good excuse.  I don't know if you guys are listening.  Oh, okay.  I'm telling you what.  Check out a Coors Light, drink it, hold it in your hand.  I like the, uh...  Cut your face and see if you can get some sparkles on it.  Well, how do you explain the explosion in the boxers?  How does that happen?  Well, it was on tap. 
[01:25:30]  I really enjoyed it.  Boy, I like porno without the condoms.  That's good.  Oh, yeah.  It's the only way for two men to get together.  It's called barebacking, kid.  I cannot stand when they put condoms on in porno.  No.  Like I care, like I care about the health of the participants.  I don't even care about my own health. 
[01:26:00]  I don't care what they're doing well.  He's with hookers without a condom.  Like you don't have to...  He's only kidding.  C-block.  He's constantly working it.  This has turned into a bar.  You don't want to spread that around.  All right.  A high five, as they call it.  We should take a break, I guess.  All right.  We can do that.  Get the girls back there to take some more pictures.  I've got to change my underpants.  We're up to seven girls.  Seven girls have shown up for the Naughty Nighty concert so far here in Philly. 
[01:26:30]  Philly representing big time today.  Underwear looks like the turtle wax rag that's under the sink.  Yeah.  And the front, the back looks like a high school parking lot.  A shoeshine rag.  And there's a party going on outside, too.  Is there?  I don't know what...  No, outside the studio.  Oh.  There's a crowd out there.  We should see what's going on outside.  Yeah.  They're hanging outside the WYSP studios today.  Too bad these windows don't open.  Yeah, they try.  And then we can wow out the window.  No, we can just...  Oh, the girls wave into the crowd outside.  Look at that. 
[01:27:00]  Wow out the window.  Are they waving?  That's good.  That's good.  Some guy's drinking a fifth of vodka, and he's got a set of plastic boobs on it.  It's a W-O-W.  Let's bring the plastic boob guy up.  Oh, you want to...  What the hell?  Reward him?  Why not?  With that creativity?  Also, a couple phone numbers.  We'll go to the phones next in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Philly, 866-2774.  Wow.  Jimmy Schubert hanging with us.  Can we tell that story on the air or what? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, we can when we come back from the break.  Really?  Yeah, we'll talk about it.  Sure, I'm in trouble now.  But I'll tell him.  Jimmy Schubert playing the Stress Factory tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  He's got a good little story about a fellow comedian, let's say.  Yeah, yeah.  Comedian.  Yeah.  And if people need to make reservations for tickets in the New Brunswick, it's 545-HA-HA.  732-ERICODE.  732-ERICODE, right.  In the Brunswick.  All right.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news. 
[01:28:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I like it when this show's dirty.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, broadcasting live from Philly.  Jimmy Schubert in the studio playing the Stress Factory.  We got Jim Norton.  We got Keith Robinson.  We got to get him on the air in a little bit.  We got the lovely ladies from Risque Video, Anthony.  Yes.  They are posing for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Let me take a look at Rick.  Good luck to the rest of the cities after today.  That's all I have to say, right, Anthony? 
[01:28:30]  Let me just get a look at what Rick's doing over there now.  Oh, very nice, Rick.  Right.  You got her on the chair.  Wow.  Yeah, no one's even talking.  That was a very nice point.  Are we allowed to get naughty during the picture?  To get naughty during the picture?  Rick's got a blister on his finger that takes the picture.  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean by naughty?  Like, what do you want to do?  Removing articles.  Oh, don't you worry about it.  Whatever you want to do.  Yeah, of course. 
[01:29:00]  Get as naughty as you like.  The contest has no rules.  No rules.  Yeah.  There's no sitting on Jim Norton's lap, though.  That's not allowed.  Look at him.  He's got his hands in his pocket.  We know what you're doing.  Look at this guy.  Oh, my God.  I see.  Look at the guy behind Jim Norton.  This guy that came down in the studio to check us out today.  He's got the fake boobs on.  He's got the fake plastic boobs on.  With one of the nipples piercings, you've got to love the nipple piercing.  Yeah.  Attention to detail.  Dude, I would actually TF you right now.  That's how bad I am. 
[01:29:30]  What's your name, man?  My name's Ryan.  Hey, Ryan.  Thanks for coming out of the station.  No problem, guys.  It's, yeah, he's got a big...  Thanks for inviting me up, man.  Thanks.  So you've been hanging out up front and somebody saw you with those luscious boobs and...  You know what we're going to do in a little while, Anthony?  Maybe in like 20 minutes, just in case people are in the area and then we'll stop by the  WYSP studios.  We're going to send Jim Norton out there with some of these lovely ladies.  Oh, good.  You want to go down and meet the crowd downstairs?  We've got to share.  There's a nice crowd out there.  So we'll do it in like 20 minutes. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  You're close to the studio.  So, Ryan, what do you find is the most economic way to murder a runaway?  Oh, that's the kicker off from school, you know, bar in your trunk.  I like him.  He's got an answer.  You want a porno from Risque Video?  Sure.  Why not?  We can't use all these.  We just need one.  No, we don't.  Yeah, that's true.  We've got the real thing in here today.  I want to put Jimmy Schubert on the spot, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm hearing things about Jimmy Schubert. 
[01:30:30]  What things?  I'm hearing things.  What are you hearing?  Oh, you want to talk about that story?  Yeah, I want to get to the show with your mom again.  No, no.  Believe me, I'm not even going to be able to stay at my mom's house after this show.  And what were you doing down there?  No.  I heard someone in the comedy field take care of you once.  Yeah.  Sam Kinison told a story on stage one time, and I guess that's how you guys heard about the story.  And Weese, Brother Weese knows the story.  So, Brother Weese, he told me.  He told you.  And so make sure you ask Jimmy Schubert live in the air about getting some little treats. 
[01:31:00]  But it was a long time ago when I was a doorman at the comedy store, and I was back there,  and Roseanne Barr had just gotten out to the comedy store from Denver.  Yeah.  And she was hanging out there with, you know, with Sam and whatever.  And I guess she had a crush on Sam, and they hooked up.  And I guess she kind of, like, you know, gave Sam the Hummer.  And then Sam goes, all right, somebody take her home.  She didn't want to deal with it because she got pregnant.  Oh, my God.  So I wound up having to give her a ride.  Yeah, look, I just gave her a mouthful, man. 
[01:31:30]  Could you just maybe take her home or something?  Yeah.  No, no, it was great, but I don't want to hang with you or anything.  So he asked me, and she's drunk.  She doesn't remember where she lives.  And I'm renting this, like, one.  I'm renting a room in the house, and part of the rules, no overnight gas or anything.  Uh-huh.  So I have to, I can't find out where she lives, but I can't dump her off the street.  So I have to bring her in to the house.  I said, well, you have to go take the bus back the next morning or something.  Well, sure enough, we get back to the place.  I sneak her in, you know, Steve's drunk.  Oh, no. 
[01:32:00]  240-pound woman, whatever.  The next thing you know, I said, you sleep on the bed.  I'll sleep on the floor.  The next thing you know, she grabbed me and.  And, uh.  Oh, my God.  Hey, I'm not proud of it, all right?  You were taken care of.  Yeah, it's not on my resume, all right?  Pyro-Zamon.  It's inside dirt, I know.  Yeah, and I'm sure I'm going to be in trouble for telling that story.  How was it?  It was all right. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Well, even a bad one's good.  Heather and Bobby have to go.  You guys got to go.  Oh.  Yeah.  What happened?  You have to go babysit.  Babysit.  Yeah, the guy's 67.  They're going to babysit him and change his diaper.  Who's baby?  She does have to babysit.  Heather's knee.  You really have to go babysit on a Friday night?  Yeah.  Wow.  How old is this child?  She's not.  She's about a year.  All right.  Oh, really?  She's a babysitter.  I was going to say.  I kind of have a recollection of babysitters when I was a kid. 
[01:33:00]  Hey, give me the address.  Give her one of them St. Joseph Chewable Valium for Children and then give me a call.  A jar from Aldehyde.  We saw how well it works at the Muta Museum.  It's wonderful.  It's still silent.  Can you come back?  Any time you want.  Yes.  Any time.  Are you sure?  Take the road trip to New York.  We will.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you girls have our number.  This is fun.  Girls, ever been to New York City there?  All the time.  Yeah, you go there all the time?  I was just there last week. 
[01:33:30]  New York City?  New York City.  We all have to shut you down.  That's the big city.  Isn't that far?  Yeah.  A couple of you Philadelphia country bumpkins out there.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  We've got to say goodbye to Bobby and Heather.  Thank you.  It's the liars tonight, right?  Nice meeting you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The liars tonight.  There they go.  There they go.  Girls, thank you.  Yeah.  That's www.glylarity.com.  I'd like to go to your website.  I'd like to go to your website.  You guys have something cool.  What do you want to want? 
[01:34:00]  And the other girls are from, what is it, risquevideo.com?  Well, we're actually from Club Risqué.  All right.  Wait.  Get on the mic.  I'm looking at risquevideo.com.  They have pictures of the girls that are here.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  This is a nice shot.  Okay.  Well, we're actually from...  Look at you.  You're dressed like a little devil, aren't you?  Ha, ha, ha.  Wow.  That's great.  We're actually from Club Risqué.  We have two locations.  One in Philadelphia and one right outside of Philadelphia.  But we're representing Club Risqué.  Great job.  No, risquevideo.com today.  Yes.  Yes.  Dude, I'm in show business. 
[01:34:30]  Risquévideo.com.  Remember, R-I-S-Q-U-E.  Video.  For those of you who don't know how to spell it.  Now, what's this about removing articles of clothing?  Someone's saying somewhere on the block.  She wants to get naughty in the Naughty Nighty contest.  You want to get naughty?  Yeah.  Yumping, Jiminy.  Baby, you get naughty.  You step over there into the Naughty Zone.  Well, let's see what you got there.  Let's disrobe.  What do you think?  Whoa.  She's moving those pecs.  Okay, moving through.  Let's see.  Moving Jim's pecs.  Wow.  There you go.  I didn't see.  I didn't see.  Oh, my God. 
[01:35:00]  Wait.  Hold on.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Do it.  Come on.  What's that?  Do it.  Do it.  You do one of those, Jim?  No, you don't want to do it.  Oh, she doesn't want to do that trick?  No, because it makes them ugly.  We don't force anybody to do anything without our guns.  It doesn't make them ugly.  Just do it.  With your top on, just do it.  How does it make them ugly?  Come on.  Just to be silly ghosts.  Come on.  We're all having fun.  Yeah.  Hey, there you go.  Cool.  Hey, I can do that with my testicles.  Check it out.  Make them jump around.  Sure. 
[01:35:30]  Hey, Rick, why don't we get the blonde in the corner?  Because she wants to get naughty with the Naughty Night.  She wants to get dirty.  Rick is just mesmerized by the pictures he just took.  I know.  Rick's looking at his work.  This is Lexus.  She isn't just any girl.  That's some good work right there.  That's Lexus.  Lexus.  Morgan.  Morgan.  She's Elise.  Look at this.  What?  Yeah, she's Elise.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Lexus.  Very nice.  There you go.  Very nice.  Why would your parents name you after a car?  That's nice.  I understand.  I'm not that naive.  That's Vegas, Portia. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And Volvo.  Volvo.  Hey, Rambler.  They keep piling up the porno.  Yeah, I know.  Nothing wrong with that.  They just brought in another...  It's like a DVD porno.  I'm in this one.  She's in that.  You're in me?  I'm in this.  It's not a porno.  Let me see that.  What is this?  It's a nude beauty contest called Hot Body.  High octane.  Oh, look at this one.  It's called The Bottom Dweller.  This one's called The Swerder.  Guess what that's about.  And the younger the berry, the sweeter the juice.  Wow.  And this girl is...  Boy, she looks like a piece of strudel. 
[01:36:30]  She's got all that icing on her, I guess.  Dude, this girl was sitting on my lap.  I could have hit Kennedy from the sixth floor.  Oh, my God.  I'm so happy to be with this show right now.  Wow.  She's bouncing on your lap.  Her cheek has gone back and to the left.  It's like a Zabruder film.  We should talk to Jim Norton's friend, Keith Robinson.  Yeah.  Keith.  Keith is the most disgusting man in this room.  He's the biggest pervert here. 
[01:37:00]  More than you?  Yeah, he's a...  Hey, Keith, grab that mic.  He's a total pig.  Oh, man.  What do you think of your pal, Jim Norton?  What I think of Norton?  He's come a long way, right?  Yeah, he's come a long way.  I'm just looking at these girls, man.  I don't...  Yeah.  I'm happy to be here with these women, man.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, it's great stuff.  Yeah.  I do remember her.  We will be in the shoes right now.  How do you guys know her?  I came to see them at the Comedy Cellar a couple weeks ago.  He always knows...  Huh?  He always knows the girls.  Norton always knows the girls. 
[01:37:30]  There's always some little thing that happens like, oh, Jim, oh, yeah, we met.  Oh, no, we met.  We met before.  Yeah, we saw his picture at the post office.  Yeah.  We met.  He was standing on a line up.  I was behind the glass.  Point my finger at him.  Sure.  If you were in my room, you'd get a triple Indy into my hamper.  But he knows the girls, and boy, look at that.  Right on his lap.  All right.  But she knows I'm harmless.  I'm a gentleman.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Just don't even try anymore. 
[01:38:00]  Could you please?  It's insulting.  It really is, quite frankly.  Harmless.  Harmless.  Like Ted Bundy driving around in his Volkswagen Beetle.  Harmless.  I think she likes me.  I'll cut her head off and put it in the window.  Look how the girls calm everyone down.  Yeah.  He's walking around with a shivered head in the camera bag, Ed Gein.  Oh, yeah.  Ed Gein.  Was that Ed Gein?  Ed Gein.  He was great.  Edmund Kemper did that.  Ed Kemper.  You're right.  Edmund Kemper.  What did Ed Gein do?  He used to cut off the bodies and wear them, the skin, yeah. 
[01:38:30]  And he wanted to know what the heads would look like on a stick.  Yeah.  Whereas Kemper was the co-ed killer in California, and he ate dinner with his mother with a head  in a duffel bag.  Is he in the movie about Ed Gein?  Yeah.  And that's where he said he almost lost it.  Edmund Kemper.  Yeah.  He said he had the camera bag, and he was walking, and his couple had the hand in hand.  And he said, and that's where he realized he had gone a little.  That's where he realized.  Wow, that's kind of a far line.  I saw the movie, though, about Ed Gein.  It was great. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, did you whack your bag?  Yeah, constantly.  He skinned the woman, and then he gets into her skin, goes outside, and he's in front of  his house in the dark wearing a woman's body, and just kind of feeling himself going, oh,  oh.  He was trying to get in touch with his female side.  Yeah, sure.  Whatever.  You say that so critically.  I can just picture a little Jimmy Norton doing it. 
[01:39:30]  Jim, perfect fit.  Go ahead, Jim.  I'm sorry, he's 14.  Perfect.  You can help me put this couch in the van.  That was it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like, he'd ask the girl to help him put the couch in the van, and she would get  the end that had to go in the van first, and, like, lift it up, and she'd get in the van,  and he'd push the couch in and slam the door shut.  Jane gum.  Then drive her away to her fate.  You know, we forgot to talk about Soap Lady. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, at the Muta Museum.  The Muta Museum.  There's a woman, dead for quite a while, laying in a glass case.  Mummified, kind of, right?  She's almost mummified.  She's laying on her back.  Nude.  You can't even tell body parts, though.  It's just, like, this big, massive gook.  The mouth was open.  Her mouth, accepting, open.  Yeah, she's just laying there, and it turns out where they buried her, because she had  a high fat content in her body, and they buried her in some kind of soil with certain 
[01:40:30]  minerals that acted with the fat, and it rendered her and made her into soap.  So, it's a...  The Pete?  Yeah.  What do they call it?  It's called Pete, or the...  Hey, I don't know who did it.  It was her.  No, she...  Yeah, whatever it was, the chemical reaction, it turned her into soap.  And she's just laying there, and it's really disgusting, especially when Jim put his mule  so close to her mouth.  I'm just cleaning it, sir.  It's soap.  She looked like the old lady from The Shining who gets out of the tub. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  That's exactly what she looked like, with her mouth open.  Oh, yeah.  Hot scene.  Yeah, little tiny feet.  Anthony, we got a girl on the line.  Oh, we do.  Remember that feature we were thinking about doing yesterday?  What?  Well, Snakey, put down candy.  Oh, okay.  I know what you're talking about.  Candy.  Hello.  What's going on?  Where are you calling from?  Brooklyn.  I was there on Tuesday for your Naughty Nighty contest.  Oh.  Candy.  Yes.  The African princess.  Candy.  If you want to call it that. 
[01:41:30]  You got some competition now, girl.  Oh, yeah?  That's okay.  I love candy.  She got some junk in the trunk.  My brand new being goddess.  What's up, girl?  These ladies down here in Philly are beautiful.  Cool.  Why are you calling us today?  Hi.  For the 5 o'clock FACO.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, see, we brought that up yesterday.  We said if the ladies want to run with it, they can.  FACO?  Huh?  You're in your little place there?  Yeah.  And what are you wearing? 
[01:42:00]  I'm wearing a God Bless America t-shirt and white panties.  Ooh.  Now, you know what's so funny?  Because I read about this in Cosmopolitan.  How women, they had a big article on how women should properly fake orgasm.  Really?  And a man.  Yeah.  You know, it's a big story continuing on page 70.  I got halfway through and I said, you know, that's nothing.  You know, men can fake whole relationships.  I mean, anybody can lay there and jiggle around for 30 seconds.  You can't walk around and smile on your face every 70 or not.  I love you too, pumpkin.  Why would you want to learn how to fake an orgasm? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  See that?  Very good.  How does a guy fake an orgasm?  Good setup.  How does it?  See, it's the blonde who wants to get naughty.  What if I do that?  Oh, God.  Do you honestly think that's going to make it on our airwaves?  I don't care.  I don't care anymore.  You can't say that.  And women never fake orgasms right.  You know how hard it is to get her to go cry and just go, please, mister? 
[01:43:00]  You are horrid, man.  Why don't we give this a shot?  Let's see what happens, all right?  Candy.  Candy.  Yeah.  Come on.  Wow.  There's so many girls in the studio right now.  All right, Candy.  Candy, remember, start off slow, like, you know, this isn't the way to my house.  And work it into a crescendo.  Uh-huh.  Nope.  All right.  Oh.  Mhm.  Oh. 
[01:43:30]  Oh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  It was so good. 
[01:44:00]  Whoa.  Okay, terrific.  There you go.  Nice.  Nice work, man.  I want to do a real one now.  Thank you.  We thought we were good.  See, the ladies here in Philly, very impressed.  Wait a minute.  They got moistered in a bun cake when you were doing a duck.  I was just sitting on my knee.  She did that one Brooklyn style.  That's with a gun to her head. 
[01:44:30]  Candy, thank you.  Thank you.  Good luck in the Naughty Nighty contest, too.  Hey, let's say hi to John Paul in Buffalo.  Hey, John Paul.  Hello.  What's going on, bro?  Well, we got our first contestant just came in.  Ah, Buffalo.  That's right, our first one.  The Naughty Nighty contest.  That's right.  Our first contestant, Tammy, from Lockport, New York.  She's getting dressed right now.  Looks really nice.  What does she look like there?  She's a redhead. 
[01:45:00]  What are you, about five?  I'm going to say five-three.  You're five.  She's five foot.  Redhead.  Five.  Muscular.  Redhead.  Muscular.  Muscular.  Wait, wait.  Muscular.  Big back on her, does she?  Is this your boyfriend or husband?  Our husband's with her.  Okay.  Oh.  Her husband's in here keeping a close eye.  All right.  But she looks good.  She's got...  How would you...  What would you describe what you're wearing here?  So far...  So far...  Fringe.  Red.  Yeah.  Tracing through.  Leather. 
[01:45:30]  Boots.  Big black leather boots.  Describe...  You know something?  Describe her a little better because you just described that kid from the Underwood  Deviled Ham commercial.  Maybe, uh...  Oh, Antley can only hope.  She's got these big black boots that are going up to mid-thigh.  Yeah.  Okay.  She's got a...  What, do you got a tattoo there?  You got a tattoo on your stomach?  You got a tattoo of an angel on her stomach.  There you go. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  Yeah, this is nice.  Buffalo.  Hopefully, you guys will get more girls down there.  This has got to be the best day of radio ever.  She's going to start across her stomach where she got shanked and sea-blocked.  She's got a set of eight cups and kind of sagging a little bit.  Oh, my God.  I mean, she's really high.  Is that Colin Quinn there?  No, it's not Colin Quinn.  Oh, it sounds like Colin Quinn.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't make me come up there to Buffalo.  It's Jimmy Stewart.  He's playing Stress Factory all this week.  That's right.  Two shows on Friday.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right, John.  All right.  We're going to take the pictures. 
[01:46:30]  I'll send them to you here in a little bit.  Thank you.  We'll check them out on opandanthony.com later on tonight.  There you go.  Buffalo, man.  Finally representing the contest.  Come on.  That's great.  Where's Boston?  You sons of bitches.  We gave you a whole goddamn segment on Worcester yesterday.  Massachusetts.  Help us out.  Me and my friend Bobby was in a bar smoking pot and drinking bass, shooting dots.  Who walks in?  Mismatch.  And they don't send a letter R up there in Boston.  They got all those unpronounced R's.  And they go up into the atmosphere and they come down places like Texas where people go 
[01:47:00]  Warsh.  How did that happen?  I don't say.  Because they've unpronounced.  Pronounce your R's up there in Boston.  And now you have an idea.  Where did New York come from?  Those people in Boston.  They've all pronounced them and we can start with them.  So we got this wicked cool girl coming down.  You know how bad that sounds to say Norton's an apist?  No.  No, you always pronounce the first R.  For some reason they do that.  Yeah.  Hey, we got to go to Wally on the phones.  Wally loved what Candy just did. 
[01:47:30]  Wally.  Come on there, Stink.  Help us out.  Hello.  There he is.  All right.  Hey, Wally.  What's up?  Oh, my God.  I couldn't believe it.  I'm driving on the highway.  Not the highway.  I'm driving on the back road coming from work.  And I'm listening to Candy as she crescendoed, as Anthony put it.  Yes.  I almost ended up hitting this guy in front of me.  Honest to God.  I was injured.  Another almost accident.  Did you have to pull over and rub one out?  I'm telling you, dude.  I'm getting ready to do that right now.  Did you fire up the flesh?  Did you fire up the flesh, Twinkie? 
[01:48:00]  I told you, I hate nothing.  You're real, dude.  Come on.  Tell us, you dirty bastard.  All right.  Well, you want me to say I'm going to rub one out right now?  No, no.  No, no.  That's only good when girls do it.  Yeah, we'd love to hear that, dummy.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to have Jim Norton go outside with some of these lovely ladies.  Oh, yeah.  So we can share with the people hanging outside the station today, right?  What's up there?  Huh?  I have to get my pictures taken first.  Oh, Rick's got to take your pictures.  Yeah, Rick.  Please call me.  No.  That's okay.  Hey, Rick, I see a couple African princesses out there. 
[01:48:30]  Keisha, you're the virgin.  Yeah, baby.  Keisha, you're the virgin.  Who's thinking about losing your journey on the show?  Wow, look at you, Schubert, man.  You dog, look at you.  Hey, I'm just trying to help out.  Look at that.  He's got too many seeds in a joint.  How close does Rick need to get?  He's jamming his fist in and squeezing the heart going, waka, waka.  Hey, you don't need to get a girl.  You can see kidney.  That's it.  Yeah.  You're up there.  You're up too close.  You can see kidney up there.  Internal organs.  Hold back a little.  Get the telephoto off and back out. 
[01:49:00]  Anthony, Keisha, the virgin, will join the party.  Oh, that not for long.  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin.  Us two, A-Hole.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  We're blowing it up in Philly today.  Yeah.  A bunch of girls from the worst game video here.  They have joined the Naughty Nighting contest.  What is going on over here?  Can't a man talk to his fiancee?  What's the problem?  I think we have a love connection. 
[01:49:30]  The place is turning into a bar.  Isn't he just talking the next one with a stack of dirt movies?  I know.  It's like a pile of porno up here.  And Norton's talking with his new friend.  There you go.  Hey, Anthony, Tim Sabian's got this kooky idea he wants to...  Oh, Tim, grab this on mic here, please.  He wants to run by us.  Sorry.  I'd much rather have you standing there.  Oh, absolutely.  I know what you mean.  Tim, what's going on?  Way to nerd up the room.  Oh, God.  Tim, you want me to boot the girl? 
[01:50:00]  You can sit on my lap.  All right.  This place hasn't stopped.  This is unbelievable.  Yeah, having a lot of fun there.  God, are we having fun.  You've never seen me this late on a Friday ever here.  Ever, ever, ever.  But please escort over to the First Union Center to see the Wings game tonight.  Really?  And bring you right back afterwards.  You want us to go over there?  Can we bring the girls?  If we can get in the car.  Girls, you want to come with us?  I have to go to work.  Son of a bitch.  I have to go take off my clothes for money.  I'm sorry.  Ouch. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, well, there's a lot of places you can do that.  The guy with the fake boots will go with us.  Oh, great.  See, this is the reality of our lives.  I know how they feel.  I have to go work tonight, too.  What about the other risque video girls?  Yeah, what about the other girls?  What about that?  Wait, so you're going to get us a police escort?  Police escort.  Over to the center.  Right.  Bring you back, and you'll be there in time for Norton's show.  What time will this happen?  Right at 7 o'clock.  Right at 7.  Can we hop in?  Can I ride in one of the cop cars?  Absolutely. 
[01:51:00]  Absolutely.  Can I drive it?  Absolutely.  After I've been slamming beers all day.  On a drive, and I've been cruising.  Can I put the siren on?  Put the siren on.  Light, siren.  Can I have your gun?  You can't drive, but you can't hold the plunger.  That's New York.  Look at this outfit.  Look at this little bit.  Wow.  You know something, Morgan?  Wow.  That is so hot.  Would you come with us down there dressed like that, please?  Where is she going?  She's going to work. 
[01:51:30]  She's going to...  Tim, tell the girls where they're going.  Where?  We're going to the Wings game.  Tim, if we can't get the girls to go, we're not going.  We're going for a few seconds.  We're going to pop out there in front of a crowd of how many people?  18,000.  18,000 people, we're going to walk out, say hi, you girls will say hi, the place will  go bull crap, and then we get whisked right away to Norton's show.  What do you say?  Okay, only if I can plug risquevideo.com.  Don't worry about the plug.  Hey, you keep that up, I'm going to plug you in a minute. 
[01:52:00]  You know what?  They're used to being probably in shows or something like that.  Don't let them plug like that.  It's okay.  Don't worry about it.  We'll plug the hell out of it.  Excuse me, fellas, can I plug my website, www.jimmyshuber.com?  Oh, God.  Dude, nobody wants to go there or to eatabullet.com.  Nobody wants to see my website.  Police escort in.  I think we've got to do it.  I think we've got to come out with girls, though.  Yeah, we need girls.  They don't want to see girls.  Girls, will you go?  It's right after the show.  It's right after the show, 7 o'clock. 
[01:52:30]  Come on, girls.  We'll take you right back here.  What do you say?  What do you say?  Girls, girls.  You guys want to go?  No, we need girls.  Morgan, you're going?  We're discussing everybody.  Morgan, you're going with us?  Morgan and...  I'm going to definitely like until we're in.  Okay, she's going.  What about you?  Girls, too.  You're going?  I'll go.  All right.  Any other girls?  Come on, girls.  You've got to go.  Yes, okay.  Come on, Julia.  You're going?  Come on, Nico.  All right.  There we go.  Make us put lingerie on Tim Sabian. 
[01:53:00]  Jimmy Schubert, you're going?  I've got to go to Brunswick.  And I've got to undress mentally.  It's going to be just as good there.  Yeah, it'll be just as good.  It'll be fun.  This works out really well.  You get the hot chicks, and I've got to drag Keith Robinson to my room.  All right, we'll figure it all out.  Police escort, though.  Come on.  This is too much.  You've got to go to a police escort whenever you can get one.  Any time you can get one.  Any time you're not in the back of the cop court, you've got to take it.  Right. 
[01:53:30]  I'm telling you, these girls, I'm so, is that wrong?  Lapels.  Did we dump that?  There's no lapels there.  I'm kidding.  Wait a minute.  Are we staying in these at all?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  That's how you're going.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow, wings.  I know.  I would say.  You're some happy wings fans.  Hey, Anthony, Keisha's here.  The virgin.  Yeah, let's talk to Keisha.  Great.  Girls, we're going to have time to talk to Keisha. 
[01:54:00]  Here comes Keisha.  Yeah, baby.  I'm a virgin.  You're a virgin?  I'm a virgin.  Grab that mic there, baby.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  You're a virgin?  You're a virgin?  Yeah, I'm a virgin.  I pulled you on a leg and plays Jingle Bells.  What?  Are you really a virgin, girl?  Yeah, I'm a virgin.  Why did you decide to remain a virgin up until now?  Because, I mean, my goods are precious.  Oh, really?  Yes.  We know another girl who thought her goods, let me tell you a little story. 
[01:54:30]  Let me tell you a little story.  A girl named Patty.  Oh, stalker Patty.  There's another girl.  No, honestly.  Stalker Patty?  Yeah, stalker Patty.  I'll tell you this story.  She thought her goods were precious also.  Mm-hmm.  So she saved them for the right guy.  The right guy never came along.  She is now 46, 47 years old.  She is still a virgin.  Mm-hmm.  It's not like a car where it becomes classic if it's unused after so many years.  It's like a head of lettuce.  It becomes fermented.  And no one wants it. 
[01:55:00]  It becomes brown around the edges and wilts.  Right.  Wilted.  And it tastes bad.  No one wants it.  Right.  What is it?  Well, you always want to be hooking me up with a firefighter from New York, but I mean...  Do something for the cause, man.  Right?  We can hook you up with a firefighter.  Yeah.  But I know somebody.  Who?  I know somebody who I want to give the goods up to.  Who?  Who?  His name is Greg Passamise.  Oh, yeah?  Does he know this?  Does he know?  Yeah, really.  He knows now.  Is it a secret to him?  It's not really a secret.  No?  I mean, I joke around, but I never... 
[01:55:30]  You guys hang out and stuff?  You're like friends?  We work together.  You work together?  Yeah.  So he doesn't know?  I mean, I play...  Let's bring him out right now.  All of a sudden, it's like a Springer episode.  What the hell is this?  Does it bother him that you're wearing Tim Sabian's slacks?  What do you mean that?  I'm just coming from a car and going, don't go to your boo.  Oh, yeah.  Don't go to your boo.  Don't go to your boo, because I'm just going to your boo.  F you up.  Let me ask a question.  You've never been...  No one's ever...  What is this?  I love how you go around the words. 
[01:56:00]  You might as well have just used the F word.  It got dumped out of.  No one's ever slipped a head in and dropped anchor on you?  No.  No.  Why are you so surprised?  See, do you do other things?  I'd be all over you like a bum on a bologna sandwich, cupcake.  Boy, you've got a wayward words, man.  I'm an old smoothie.  Old smoothie.  Old smoothie.  So, can we make this happen or what?  I'm free.  That's right to say.  We'll bring you to New York with this guy, Greg.  If he's game, we'll get you a hotel, whatever you want.  That's why I wait until then.  We'll do it right now. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Do you want to?  How about on the console with a comic named Keith?  Hey, Keith.  Hey, Keith.  Let me take him for a test drive.  Check it out first.  He wants to check out what's under the hood.  Keith is packing until he's got like nine and a half.  How do you even know?  That's soft.  Because we're friends a long time.  He's really packing.  That's nine and a half soft.  I've been friends with Opie for a long time.  I could not tell you.  Opie's got about seven and a quarter.  Now, how do you know?  I know. 
[01:57:00]  He's just about right.  Sick, sick man.  Not as much girth as you'd like, but it's good length.  I like the girth.  You do anything else?  You remain the virgin, but have you done anything else?  I kissed and hugged.  That's it?  You haven't given up the mouth or nothing?  No.  No?  I did that with my grandmother.  Yeah.  Opie tongue kissed his grandmother.  By accident.  He did.  By accident, yeah.  He tongue kissed his grandma.  I didn't know.  All right.  Hold everything.  We've got to all take a look.  Wow. 
[01:57:30]  Okay.  The girl that wanted to get naughty for the Naughty Nighty contest is getting her pictures  taken.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Hey, is that pierced?  It's over there.  That is pierced.  Yeah.  It is pierced.  Oh, my God.  Wowee.  God, am I homely?  Our website's going to explode today.  It's got a little hitler mustache on it.  Yeah.  Very little.  Very little.  Are you sure that was?  It looked like it was a wood floor.  Whoa.  And the piercing, it looks like it shot a pellet into a steak at home.  It just looked like a cut of intermediate rough.  Excuse me, hot girl. 
[01:58:00]  Could you do that again?  Intermediate rough.  Let's look.  Rick, get out of the way, please.  That's not U.S. Open rough.  Hot girl, could you do that again?  Rick, look out.  Let's listen.  Is there anything there?  Or is it clean as a whistle?  Oh, my God.  Clean as a whistle.  It is.  It looks like somebody hit it with a weed whacker.  All right.  Made it, virgin.  That's how you'll do a virgin, right?  Because all of these new things, that's how you'll do a virgin.  Yeah, but she's not surprised with doing a virgin.  How do you know she's going to be any good? 
[01:58:30]  I mean, you know, hey, he's been pretty bad.  He's still good.  The virgin in the back door to a way.  Anything, nothing.  Just kissing and hugging.  That's it?  Because I was waiting for the right person.  The right person.  Yeah, well, he got hit by a car three days ago.  Sorry.  It's time to make up for lost time, sister.  Drop those pants.  What's your name?  That's Jimmy Schubert. 
[01:59:00]  I'm Filthy Mc...  I'm Filthy.  You should call me Filthy.  You should tour with Sam Kinison.  By the way, I'm a black man for the waist down.  A lot of guys think it's his leg.  It's actually a penis with a bowling shoe on the end of it.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And he also has a home arrest bracelet on his ankle.  It might have been funny if I said ankle instead of anklets.  You stink!  A little choking, fat nothing.  I have bought my bomb.  Loser! 
[01:59:30]  I've never seen such self-hatred.  Where do we go with Keisha now?  Well, we have to hook her up.  Now, you have a guy.  Does he know this?  We're talking around at work all the time.  Can we call him?  Can we call him right now?  I have the cell number.  Well, that's good.  I don't want to call the guy.  Cell number one, prison.  I'm just kidding.  If you're trying to make a person at all black, they're going to jail.  You know what the thing is, though?  You've got to sign a waiver.  I don't want to call the guy and make the matchup,  and then he's waiting for you with a 9mm when you get home,  and there's a shooting like when that one's your Jetty Jones shot. 
[02:00:00]  Right.  You never know.  You don't want that to happen.  Is he black?  You didn't even say if he was black or white.  He's Italian.  Oh, see?  Oh, Sicilian?  We've still got to find out if he's black or white.  Come on.  I'm kidding, my Sicilian brethren.  We have that cigarette now?  We've got to call the guy.  What a great movie, man.  Phenomenal.  All right.  We're going to dial the number and see if he's game for this.  All right.  In the meantime, Stinky, put Foz down.  Our buddy Foz from Cleveland, Anthony. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  He might have some more good news.  Oh, that's good.  Cleveland goes.  Foz.  Foz, what's up, man?  What's up, man?  I got another teen.  God damn, please.  Cleveland, Cleveland, and the teen girls.  Dude, the winner.  Right there.  She's 18 years old.  Her name is Celeste.  And let me describe this to you guys.  A see-through flag shirt and a white thong.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Very, very nice.  That's not doing us a lot of good here in Philadelphia, my friend.  Her boots go up to her knees. 
[02:01:00]  What did she just say?  What did she say?  She said, I miss money.  My knees.  Oh.  Your knees.  Yeah.  She's, uh...  All right.  We look forward to seeing your pictures.  Does she color outside the lines?  It only...  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  All right, Foz, make sure you take some good pictures.  Oh, we'll take excellent pictures, man.  I'm telling you, this is going to give the girls in Philly a run for their money.  Doubt it.  Doubt it.  Doubt it.  I don't, man.  These are battling it out, Ant.  You know what it is?  Really?  The girl that's being photographed right now, they're going to give her the trip and the 
[02:01:30]  plane.  She just gave up on the nighty part.  Oh.  Look, you're so trying.  Would you stop?  Um, look, I know I have no shot.  That's the beauty of me.  It's the same girl Norton's been hugging and pumping against.  I have no shot.  All right, Foz, I'm going to let you go, because I think Keisha's Greg is on the phone here.  Keisha's Greg is on the phone.  All right.  Hey, Greg.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Greg, what's up, man?  You're live on the Opie and Anthony show.  Is that cool?  Oh, yeah, man.  That's cool.  I called him before.  All right.  We need a little more volume on Greg's phone, but hey, Keisha's in the studio. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, yeah?  And we're trying to do something on our show where we get a girl to lose her virginity  live on our show.  Oh, really?  Keisha wants to do it, and she wants to do it with you, Greg.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Where are we going to do it at?  On your home planet, from what it sounds like.  What is with that phone?  I'm sorry, man.  It's the cell phone.  Dude, it sounds like you're in a coffee can with a string attached to it.  Tied to the telephone line. 
[02:02:30]  Sorry, man.  That is great.  Does that cell phone have a clutch on it?  Is that one of those wood-burning cell phones?  Hey, Greg.  Hey, what's up, man?  Oh, man.  You want to, real quick, you want to try to just call him back or something?  All right.  We'll give it a whirl.  Nanu, nanu.  We're going to try to get you on a better line there, Greg, all right?  All right.  Cool, man.  All right.  We're going to try you on your communicator.  Open a hailing frequency aura. 
[02:03:00]  We'll get one of the engineers to figure it out.  Hey, why don't we send Jim out with some of the girls for the gang that's hanging outside  the studio?  Why?  They might not come back.  That's a good reason.  I didn't know there was a ditch.  She fell into it.  We've got to send Morgan out in that outfit.  Yeah.  There's a small, there's an angry mob out there now.  Is there really?  Yeah.  So I think they're ready.  I have to take hold, then I'll be ready to bring the gals out.  Will you?  Yeah.  Why don't you just do that out there?  Be yourself. 
[02:03:30]  You know what I picture this turning out like?  The scene where they landed the bunnies in Vietnam in Apocalypse Now?  Yeah.  They're going to have to airlift them out of there for their lives.  I don't want the devil.  Susie, cue.  Help, help, help.  The devil stays.  The devil stays.  No, no, she's got to go.  I'm sorry.  The devil stays.  Jimmy.  You got to share, man. 
[02:04:00]  That's what this show's about.  Yeah, she'll be back.  She'll be back.  We'll bring her back.  You're being selfish.  I'm going to go tinkle, man.  We're going to bring girls out.  All right.  Nice.  Nice.  Don't worry.  Her dad doesn't pick her up for a while.  Let's try this.  Let's try Greg again.  All right.  Okay.  Greg.  Yeah, what's up?  Is that better?  Ah.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  It's better.  There you go.  Like this.  All right.  So you know the deal, right?  Yeah, I know it.  I know it.  You work with Keisha.  All right.  All right.  And she wants to do you, man. 
[02:04:30]  Does she?  Does she?  Yeah.  Did you know this?  Not really.  We kind of flared around.  Right.  A little flared.  That's what she said.  You play around a little bit.  But she's a virgin.  Did you know this?  No, I did not know that.  She is untouched by man.  Oh, wow.  And we have something going on on our show where we want a virgin to lose her virginity.  Really?  In any way she wants.  Like if she wants a nice hotel room, she wants to do it in a limo, whatever setting,  we'll do the best we can to make it happen. 
[02:05:00]  Right.  Like a broken car underneath the bridge like you guys were talking about.  Yeah.  So that's how we met her.  She called up and she's a virgin.  And she would like to lose it with you.  How do you feel about that?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  You know, that's pretty great.  That's pretty great.  You would do it?  Oh, God.  No.  In a balloon nut, eh?  No.  You know what?  No, no.  No.  Dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it,  dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it, dance it,  Well, help me stop.  She goes.  Oh, yeah.  You know what's better than the end of the dove? 
[02:05:30]  The Feathernest Inn in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, you can have Tarzan's Treehouse.  Are you there?  Yes.  Oh.  It's the theme room.  Oh, it's one of those wheel in and F and leave in an hour thing.  Oh.  You stay all night.  They give you, like, champagne and they, you know, they wine, you dine, you have to follow  on the fire thing.  They give you all the information.  So you want to go to some kind of nice hotel like that where it's a little thematic thing?  Yeah, that'd be great.  You know?  And then you get your F on? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  That sounds all right.  What do you think?  Are you surprised?  You don't sound that shocked or anything.  Well, I'm definitely shocked.  You get a lot of tail, my friend.  Uh, yeah.  You know, I don't think too bad.  I don't think too bad.  Yeah?  Because it doesn't sound like a guy going, oh, my God, I'll be there in a minute.  You got to do it.  You got to do it, man.  Yeah, you got to do this, man.  Yeah.  I'm all about it.  I'm all about it.  All right.  About it, about it.  About it, about it.  So when can we make this happen?  Oh, man, whenever you want. 
[02:06:30]  You name the date and I'll be there.  Well, we both work Monday through Friday.  How about on a weekend?  No, because it's got to be during the show.  During the show.  Yeah, it's got to be during the show.  So, like, after work, you guys would go right there, we'd drop the recording devices in,  and let's see what happens.  No, we won't record anything.  It's, you know, we just talk about it later.  We'll send the video.  And let you want to record.  You got to be in this pile of porno we have in front of us.  I hear the flower of the young virgin.  You know, in Taiwan, there's actually guys whose job it is to travel to countryside and 
[02:07:00]  to flower young virgins.  So there's Jim Norton.  We know him.  Just got back.  Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.  Crinkle, crinkle.  What time do you guys work, too?  We work until four.  Oh, man, that's plenty of time.  That's almost a nooner.  Yeah, that's easy.  Hotel by five, out by 630.  But where?  She wants that.  We're going to go even at the end of the, what is it?  She wants to do it in the Tarzan room.  Yeah, in the Tarzan room.  Tarzan room.  That sounds all right.  What's the matter?  A white guy with a black girl.  In the Tarzan room? 
[02:07:30]  Is that offensive?  You've got to step in.  At some point, I've got to step in.  It's just not going to happen.  Jesus, man.  It's not like it's going to be the Amadou Diallo room.  Jeez.  That's not happening in slavery, man.  The Amistad room or nothing?  It's the Tarzan room.  It's got to happen in the Tarzan room.  It's got to be, man.  It's got to be, man.  Hey, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Yeah.  Let me ask you a question, man, really quick, man.  What do you think about the Rams? 
[02:08:00]  You like the Rams, don't you?  No, not at all.  What do you mean, no, man?  Come on.  Dude, don't worry about the sports curse.  We're in Philly.  We're in Philly, bro, so you can ram-shmam all you want.  You know, they may be the greatest show on the turf, but when they get a hold of the Flying  Eagles, man, once those guys start flying around and banging, they're going to scare  the hell out of those white people in St. Louis.  There you go.  Absolutely.  All right.  I think this might work, but Greg, you've got to commit to this. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, I'm all about it.  Keisha?  I'm about it, about it.  So Monday or Tuesday, I'm about it.  Don't you guys have during the weekend.  You'll piss us off, man.  All of a sudden, this guy's like, baby, you want to do this?  Let's do it now.  I might have to take it before the weekend's out.  No, stop it.  Jackass.  We'll kick your ass.  We'll send Rick right back down to Philly Monday or Tuesday.  We'll make this happen.  He'll, you know.  We'll give you the Tarzan room.  Okay.  You guys get chef on.  And then we'll talk to you afterwards and let you, you know, ask how it was and everything. 
[02:09:00]  Deflowering a virgin.  It's going to be great.  And then he's taking that booty until it's a crimson red.  Yeah.  What's up?  Not just a virgin, an African princess.  Oh, we've got, you know, everything you want.  You want rose petals and stuff?  Yeah.  Champagne?  Bubble basil.  What do you want, some Chrissy?  Yeah.  Yeah, we need some Bud, too.  Chrissy and Bud.  Chrissy and Bud.  All right.  There you go.  Sounds like a party.  Isn't that who's starring in that porno third down from the pile? 
[02:09:30]  It's Chrissy and Bud.  I love anal maniacs, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Three, though.  Three was where they...  The trilogy.  The problem is, a lot of people don't know, when you do that stuff, you're in between solid  matter and gas.  Oh, really?  Did you ever notice that?  You go, hey, it's just a hurt, and you just...  Could you imagine if you didn't know, if you just got that sensation, like, oh, I don't  know.  And it just, like, can fly it out.  But that's why the sphincter is a very...  It's not going to happen right the same way.  And that's why they're maniacs. 
[02:10:00]  Right?  Well, I got something for what did we learn a little later, I guess.  All right.  The sphincter is smart muscle.  The sphincter is a smart muscle.  What an educational program.  And the lock and load.  And the lock and load, man.  I'm all about helping.  Well, Greg, we're going to let you go.  We'll talk to you all there.  We got his phone number and stuff.  And we're going to try to make this happen next week.  O.P.  Anthony.  1-2-7.  B.A.C.W.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show, live from Philadelphia today, man. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, what a blast.  We're in this city up.  What a blast.  And we blew up our website, too, opianthony.com.  So, Rick has taken probably 800,000 pictures.  I was going to say 300 to 400.  No joke.  We've had about 10 or 12 girls come down for the Naughty 90 contest here in Philly alone.  And we can't get any pictures up on opianthony.com because everyone is just pounding the site.  So, later on tonight or later on this weekend, you can see what we were looking at all day long here in Philly, right? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy Schubert had to leave.  We're having fun.  He killed today, man.  Yeah.  What a lot of fun.  He killed for us.  New friend of the show.  He'll be back.  We tied him on on the phone a few times.  But, man, live in the studio.  Forget about it.  He's going to be at the Stress Factory all this weekend if you're looking for something to do.  Roy.  Jenna wants to do a Teen Wow.  Is she going to join the Naughty 90 contest, too?  No, she just wants to come in and wow, and we'll take a picture.  Good for Jenna.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:11:30]  Who are we to say no?  All right.  We love our teens.  There are girls out there, too.  They're coming in, too, right?  We won't give her any guff.  No.  Come on in.  We have five more girls we haven't even met.  Well, there's a couple familiar faces out there from New York.  I think they came down from New York to hang with us today, and they're joining the Naughty  90 contest as well.  They won't be getting any bunk from us.  Oh, no, no.  But here's a girl.  She's a teen, and she just wants to wow.  Wow.  Wow.  How are you?  What's your name?  Jenna.  Oh, duh.  They said Jenna.  Here, step right up and... 
[02:12:00]  There you go.  How old are you?  I'm 18.  18.  Now, when's your birthday?  November 7th.  November 7th.  Before that, how old were you?  17.  Yeah.  That darned math.  I thought I could, you know...  Silly me.  Who'd have thunk?  18 minus 1.  Ah, it's kind of hard.  She's a cute one.  I'm not teasing, of course.  Don't be nervous.  Don't be nervous.  We don't bite.  Please.  And who's the guy?  That's my boyfriend. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, how you doing?  You rock, man.  He loves you guys.  There you go.  We love when the boyfriends bring their teen girlfriends to meet us.  How old are you?  Four.  He's 20.  That's cool.  There you go.  Nice.  It would have been better if you were like 58.  Oh, fuck.  That's my daughter.  I just want to tell everyone it's 6-0-9.  6-0-9 now, ladies.  It's 6-0-9.  We don't want to lose a very popular feature, do we, Ant?  Here in Philly.  You know, we're broadcasting from Philly and, eh. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  We'll see what happens.  Well, Jenna, let's see what you got.  All right.  You know what?  Go buy your boyfriend over there.  A very cute blonde teen, Anthony.  So everyone back there can see.  That was smooth, though, by the way.  It's going to be fast.  It's going to be fast?  Yeah.  You know what?  You've got to go the distance.  Yeah.  It doesn't have to be like, hi, I'm going to go, oh, you know, through a drive-thru of a burger place or something.  But, you know.  Three seconds.  Three seconds on the clock.  No one will tease you.  No one will tease you.  Who's going to look at the clock?  You don't want a picture?  No, she doesn't want a picture of the face.  Not your face.  But that's not what anyone's going to be looking at. 
[02:13:30]  Don't worry about it.  They're just like, here we go.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Very deceiving.  I couldn't see because you sweat away.  Honestly, I sweat away.  You know something?  You don't have to be shy.  Don't be shy?  Believe me.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at that.  Very nice, Jenna.  Perfect.  That's great.  And what size did you call those?  Joining the teen family.  What?  Really?  Those are full C's?  I would have said D.  Yeah, I would have guessed.  I would have said D.  It looks like a take Norton's head, hit it in a spot with a ball-peen hammer, and then double it. 
[02:14:00]  That's what it kind of looked like.  Kind of had that Norton head roundness going to it.  Very nice.  Without the liver spots and dents, mind you.  Yeah, you should start naming your liver spots on your head.  I'm a disgusting, awful, un-effable human being.  If I wasn't funny, I would have shot myself when I was 14.  Oh, God.  The self-hatred is...  I love it.  It's very entertaining.  There's a girl calling from cheerleaders.  They want us to go over there tonight, but we're running out of time.  Time.  Because right after the show, we're doing a police escort to where? 
[02:14:30]  You can come back Monday.  I want to be...  I want to ride in the cop car, though.  All right.  I can do that.  We're going into the lacrosse game for a little while, then we're going to go see Norton tonight,  and then maybe cheerleaders after that, I guess.  It's just I never had this many beers and been in the back of a cop car and I had to go the distance, you know?  You know what I mean?  Kind of be...  All right.  Let's hear it for Team Jenna.  Very nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  And more girls.  What happened to the girls from Risque Video?  They had to leave?  They were out somewhere.  Oh, they better.  They're the ones that are coming with us. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, we're not going to the First Union Center without the girls.  Tim, they're still here.  All right?  And he's...  Tim, don't you have to go home to your wife?  What home?  Oh, boy.  He forgot that he had a home.  He probably just stays in a hotel when we're in town because...  Better than that.  Honey, I've got to make sure everything runs smoothly at the station.  You know, business first.  Don't get any gulf.  All right, let's let the girls in that are licking lollipops, please.  Oh, look at that one on the left.  Just sucking on lollipops.  Hi, ma'am.  Come on in. 
[02:15:30]  Howdy.  Hi, guys.  Hey, here they are.  Wow.  Hi, ladies.  We remember you.  Hey, everybody.  Our best ass winner, Anthony.  Yes.  How are you?  Why do you call her the MILF?  Oh, yeah.  The mom.  There you go.  You did well in that contest, too.  What place did you come in?  I didn't.  You didn't place in...  They dissed me.  What?  You didn't place in our MILF contest?  No.  Well, the judges.  You know how it is.  It's on our own listeners.  Sometimes they don't think.  You know, I've seen you naked many times, but I forgot your name. 
[02:16:00]  I feel bad.  Allison.  Allison.  I'm sorry.  I remember the face.  I remember the ass and everything else.  And that's your daughter I remember, right?  That's right.  There you go.  And who are you?  I am MILF's daughter's friend.  Oh.  Are you a teen?  Yes.  Actually, I just turned 18, guys.  Stop.  She's new.  I got my license.  When's your birthday?  September 27th.  Wow.  That is a fresh legal teen. 
[02:16:30]  High Monroe Township.  Fresh legal teen.  And what's your name?  Your home phone number, too.  What's your name?  Rihanna.  Rihanna.  Teen Rihanna, Anthony.  Teen Rihanna.  Joining the teen family.  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  Family.  Family of teens.  Just for you.  Yeah, that's good.  We're going to start a colony.  Do you have a gentleman friend that you see regularly?  No, actually, I've never had a boyfriend.  Wow.  Uh-oh.  That's terrible.  Come here.  Are you really a virgin?  Yes, I am.  And see, I knew.  I told them in the car. 
[02:17:00]  I said, you know what?  When I tell them I'm a virgin, they're not going to believe me.  No, because you're too beautiful to be a virgin.  Oh, wow.  So look at that.  Thank you.  That was sweet.  Unfortunately, he was talking to Jim Norton when he said that.  I know how you might have thought it was you.  Can I take her to the Tarzan room?  She's wearing a leopard skin thing.  It's all in there, man.  It's all in there.  I'm a leopard girl.  My fuel is big enough to swing on.  Oh, my God.  She's still in my boots.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  And who's the other lovely lady?  My friend.  You guys, like, make out and stuff?  No, they do.  Yeah, me and I do.  I'm terrible for you.  What's wrong when you...  Oh.  My mic was off.  Somebody decided to turn off all the mics.  Oh, good going.  Did Ben do that?  I'm way over here.  It was Rhiannon.  She did.  Something happened.  No, I don't.  I swear.  I did not.  She did.  Anthony, I don't know if they heard that, but...  Wait.  These two make out?  Your daughter makes out with her best friend and...  What?  Do you get to watch?  I'm confused.  You know, she doesn't happen to be around, you know. 
[02:18:00]  Wait, Allison's daughter, your daughter right there, makes out with who?  Rhiannon.  With her.  What, just as, like, a goof?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Has it gotten any further than that?  One of those things in Giggles, yeah.  It hasn't gone any further.  Here, make out in front of your mom.  Come on.  Come on.  Just be silly geeks.  Go ahead.  Yeah, we knew that this was going to come.  Yeah, all right.  There you go.  Oh, they're making out right in front of the...  What do you think there, Mom?  Right in front of her mom.  How's that?  It's kind of hot, right?  She's cute.  Mom, join in.  Wow.  And she can't get her pregnant, so that's even better. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  That was hot.  But Norton can right there.  That was so amazing.  That reminds me to...  And we want to sing our song, guys.  We have to figure that out.  They wrote a little song in.  Yeah, but you know something...  Really think about it.  Really think about it, guys.  We've got to talk to some lawyers.  When we go back to music.  Lawyers.  What?  Yeah, I know.  We're on camera.  Come on.  Anthony, it's now 6.15.  Where's the...  It's 6.15.  Hello.  It's 6.15. 
[02:19:00]  Ladies.  What's the matter?  Where are you?  It's 6.15.  We're looking for a certain qualified lady to call up on the phone.  You've been getting so mean on that.  You know that, don't you?  What?  We had a great one yesterday.  They're just going to...  And our new feature was great today.  The 5 o'clock fake-o.  Yeah.  Oh, I missed that.  I could have done that.  Yeah, you did.  You did.  But lucky you're here for the 6.15 sexual assault.  I want to tell the fraternity boys of AXP and Trenton that they better be voting for the right person. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, in this time, have you taken your pictures?  Guys, I hope you're listening.  Rick, have you taken their pictures yet?  All right, why don't we line up the girls?  Raymond, this means you.  All right.  Raymond.  I want to see what the Leopard Girls got.  Nice.  Yeah, start off with Leopard Girls.  Rick, if you take her back here.  It's the Naughty 90 contest.  No help.  Could you wipe what Jim left on you off of your ass when he was sitting on his lap?  A little ice cream?  Sorry about that.  It smells like bleach.  Don't let it get there. 
[02:20:00]  There's a pickled punk in your future if that happens.  I'm sure the genetic makeup there in Norton Lake.  Anthony Wackieler.  Anthony Wackieler.  Yes, yes.  Remember last time?  Oh, no, no, no.  Remember last time we were in Philly?  What happened last time we were in Philly?  The Philly Fanatic.  But it wasn't even the real old Philly Fanatic.  No, no.  We were a had.  Yeah.  Now I'm looking out there.  What do I see?  I see a big, goofy eagle.  It's lovely.  It's the eagle's mascot.  What the hell is that?  Is it the real eagle's mascot?  At least it's a plastic blow-up. 
[02:20:30]  God, that is something out of a nightmare.  Oh, my God.  That's huge.  These two.  They're pictures of this guy.  That's something out of a nightmare.  He's 10 feet tall and at least 8 feet wide.  Wow.  Mascot's always funny on the radio.  Are you afraid of the mascot, girls?  I would be.  Look, he sucks his beak in.  Wow, that's frightening.  Nothing better than mascots, though.  It's swoop, Anthony.  It's swoop.  He's a little plastic right now, actually.  You know what would be good with that mascot? 
[02:21:00]  If I cut a gasser in the suit.  Do I hear, like, a motor?  Is that thing electric?  Yes, to keep the air.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's...  Wow, look at you go.  I guarantee Tim Sabian had something to do with this.  Tim, did you have something to do with this?  There's a mascot.  There's a mascot that's wearing tight slacks.  All right, swoop.  Well, good luck to you, swoop.  Hey, swoop.  What?  Uh-oh.  What do you think?  Whoa.  He's deflating it.  His head disappeared.  Look.  I've never actually wanted a mascot to get stomach cancer. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, swoop.  What do you think of the Rams?  Uh-oh.  Does he talk?  Uh-oh.  He's sucking his face in.  And look, he's wagging his tongue, Opie.  Oh-oh.  All right.  All right.  Swoop, everyone.  Yeah.  There you go.  His tongue is long.  That was entertaining for 10 seconds.  He's melting.  Look, he melted. 
[02:22:00]  There he is.  He looks like he's ready for some anal.  Wow.  Now he's doing it.  Oh, he's on his head.  He's in that suit.  He's able to do a headstand because he's still standing up on his feet.  You know what?  That is a great gimmick suit he's got there.  It would be entertaining if it was TV, Ed, huh?  Yeah, that would be good.  Oh, and he's wagging his tail.  Yes, yes.  And the...  Okay, you sick bastard.  Get the goddamn...  We're getting into the wacky zone.  Throw out the mascot. 
[02:22:30]  Thank you, swoop.  Thank you.  I know.  Go Eagles.  Go Eagles.  There he goes.  All right.  Watch my boobs.  Watch my boobs.  He's got to re-inflate.  He's...  Look at...  He's scaring the girls.  Sucks.  All right, swoop.  There you go.  Good luck.  Good luck, swoop.  There you go, swoop.  As he tries to get himself out.  Push him through the door.  Kick swoop out the door.  It's swoop.  The Eagles mascot.  Fast race. 
[02:23:00]  Billy's a great city, but the mascots are horrendous.  What mascot is good?  There's not one.  The Cowboys' one is a guy in a hat.  That's fine.  Stupid.  All right, maybe.  Stupid.  All right, can we get left to throw into the corner?  The San Francisco Hiv.  How about that mascot?  It's a really skinny guy with five crying people around him?  Oh, God.  All right.  Every time they score, he pops a new sarcoma on his head.  Oh, that's great. 
[02:23:30]  Guys, our team is in the corner.  Oh, oh, oh.  Let's look.  Rick, Rick, if you could step up...  There you go.  There you go.  Very nice.  There she is, getting her pictures taken.  All these pictures you can get to at opiananthony.com.  But you know something?  It's going to take a while.  Be patient.  Later on tonight.  Huh?  You'll have all weekend.  What happened?  Hey, Anthony?  Yeah.  It's 620.  620, not one... 
[02:24:00]  No.  Nothing.  Hey, Stinky, let's go to Nicole from Cheerleaders.  She wants to say hi.  Aw, Stinky.  Nicole, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  How are you?  Pretty good.  How are you?  How are you?  Hey, how are you, Norton?  Yeah, what's up?  You guys hung out with us a while ago.  You came to Cheerleaders and had a great time.  I want a paternity test before anything comes my way as far as money goes.  I don't care how much we hung out.  Yeah, we're going to try to go back to Cheerleaders tonight.  You have to come. 
[02:24:30]  We would love for you to come.  Well, okay.  And go there?  We will enter your fine establishment.  Yes.  That would be wonderful.  Yeah, we're going to try it.  We've got a police escort right after the show to go to the indoor lacrosse game.  Then we're going to go see Norton for a while.  Then we'll go to Cheerleaders.  Then maybe we'll be coming.  That's for last.  Cheerleaders for last.  All right, Nicole.  What time do you guys close, Nicole?  Two o'clock.  Two o'clock.  I might be able to get over there after my second show.  I'm actually tweaking my nip thinking about that. 
[02:25:00]  I see that.  I see that.  All right, Nicole.  Thank you.  Okay, thank you so much.  All right.  We'll see you there, hopefully.  And Rick continues to pose the teen in the corner there.  What a job Rick's had today, huh?  You guys did nothing but photograph girls.  You didn't like that pose?  No, I did.  She didn't like it, Rick.  She almost fell down. 
[02:25:30]  She's got the come-hither look.  She's really confused.  Rick's trying to give her direction.  Yeah, bend over.  Bend over.  You've heard it enough times, Ray.  Come on.  You know it.  Oh.  Wow.  I'm stalling it because they're saying that something might happen on the phone line here.  Oh, I sure hope so, man.  Come on.  Not if their name is Ron or Rob, though.  No, no, no.  Don't need a Ron or a Rob at this point.  Goddamn Norton.  Jesus Christ.  What?  How many girls are going to be on your lap today? 
[02:26:00]  As many as see the pistol.  How many girls have been on his lap today?  Three.  Three?  Stop it.  And how many are going to bang me?  None.  None.  He's got a point.  He's got a point.  None.  They put their little heinies on me and then they go away and I'm back in the room again  alone on the internet.  You're better off than the guy that doesn't get any heinie on them.  No, I'm not.  Because I have the illusion for 30 seconds, hey, maybe if she drinks. 
[02:26:30]  A lot.  A lot.  Oh, God.  That was mean.  That's not nice.  That really bummed.  Good news, though.  She drinks a lot.  Oh, I like that.  Best in roofies.  Anthony, it's 623 now.  Anything coming on the phone?  Stinky, I know him.  He's working his butt off trying to make this happen in New York.  Oh, and I show.  Oh, Karen.  I see Karen.  Oh, come on, come on, Karen.  Where's a cue?  Type a cue.  Come on, Stinky.  We're counting on you here in Philly. 
[02:27:00]  All I see on the phone.  Oh, Karen hung up.  Damn it.  What do you mean half the problem is John?  I think John's answering the phone.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  It's calling so slow.  Look at them.  Where's Stinky?  All right.  We have more half-naked girls outside the studio.  We'll take a break.  The teen is posing in the corner.  Those girls better be around for when we go to the...  Well, we're not going.  Wings.  What?  We're not?  What happened?  No.  If the girls don't go with us...  Oh, yeah. 
[02:27:30]  No, we're not going alone.  No, I don't want to go out there.  I want...  How many shifts?  It's padding the approval.  Right.  You come out with girls.  I don't care who you are.  You could goose-step in a Hitler costume, and if you have hot girls in lingerie around you,  they will applaud.  Without a doubt.  All right.  We'll figure it out next.  Stay there.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:28:00]  This has got to be a joke, people.  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  What a scene in here today in Philly, huh?  We got girls licking on lollipops.  Teens half nude.  Tim Norton in the studio with his buddy Keith Robinson.  I know a couple of people from the news radio station came over and were very shocked and surprised and happy about our program being here at YSP today. 
[02:28:30]  Happy or unhappy?  Very happy.  They're very happy.  Also, big hi to everyone that hung outside the station today in the freezer.  Yeah.  Thanks for the support.  They got a little show.  Well, one of the guys is still hanging here.  It's the guy with the plastic boobs.  You put on a pair of fake boobs and, look, we invite you into the studio.  Thank you.  Look at us.  And we got, you know, we're running out of time.  We have another five girls out here that want to join the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  You want to bring him into the studio?  Bring him on in.  I'll wait.  Yeah.  Yes.  Before we talk to you really lovely ladies.  Wow.  They all look very nice, Ant.  Stinky, plop Jamie down there.  Plop.  I know.  What a lovely word.  Plop.  Yeah.  That's a great word.  Almost as good as underpants.  Jamie.  Jamie.  Hold on.  Jamie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Oh, here's the echo thing again.

Finally.  The 634.  Well, you know, it's in the six o'clock window.  All right, Jamie.  Hold on a second.  All right.  It's time.  Go ahead.  Do your song.  Hold on.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a quiz.  We've got to play the song.

Dance up and let yourself roar.  Hooray.  All right, Jamie.  You ready?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Let's all shoot.  Everyone must remain quiet.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.

It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a quiz.  Undo your pants.  Let them out to the floor.  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queen.  Very nice.  Thank God.  I thought we weren't going to have one today.  All right.  Oh, they hung up on them.  There's a guy calling from outside.  He wants Norton to go back out there with the girls. 
[02:31:00]  The new crop of girls that we got up here.  There are so many lovely gals here.  Talk to the new ones.  Well, let's get them on mic.  Hi, ladies.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Hi.  And, uh...  Did you see you guys last week?  Oh, you did?  Really?  That's it.  Well, get over here by the mic.  Get on the mic.  What's up, Philly?  There you go.  And stage presence.  Woo!  You're a Flyers fan?  I put this together in, like, three seconds.  So, like, I have the ghetto naughty noise.  I swear it looks like four or five seconds. 
[02:31:30]  It does.  It does.  It's just two hours to get here.  Let me do it.  We were in traffic for two hours.  Two hours.  Now, that's dedication, Anthony.  You know something?  I've got to say something.  Yeah.  Philly has turned out for this contest.  Man, you know, they beat New York in one day.  They're putting our hometown to shame.  Yeah.  We have, what, five girls that showed up from New York so far?  Uh-huh.  Girls falling off chairs in the background.  I see something going on.  I heard a crash.  Was that another Rick Poe's gone bad? 
[02:32:00]  Get on your tiptoes on this jagged steel.  Now, open that up.  I'm going to stick a thing of flowers in it.  That's something I haven't tried yet.  What happened?  I walked into something.  Oh, all right.  Ben, Ben.  Ben, how did the beers go, man?  I've only had one.  Look at your face.  One.  We do want to thank Budweiser.  They came here with another Bud Light.  Yeah, a lot of Bud Light.  Bud Light.  Bud Light.  The beer of choice today, Anthony.  And who are the rest of the girls?  So we've got to talk to these girls, yeah.  Let's introduce. 
[02:32:30]  Heineken.  Who's who?  They're handing me Heineken.  Heineken, stop.  I'm Jackie.  What's up?  Jackie, how you doing?  Good.  How you doing?  What's happening?  Good.  You have a little red number on?  Yes.  That's good.  Okay.  And who else we got there?  All right.  It's Ashley.  How's it going?  Ashley, wow.  You got like this complete see-through thing.  Well, look at that.  Look at that.  We like that.  Yeah.  Very, very nice.  I'm from my new city here.  Yeah.  Florida.  You're from Florida originally?  Yeah, I'm here for college.  She looks like Florida talent. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, you got that Florida look.  I'm lacking the pan right now, but that's all right.  Very good.  We're going back soon.  Very good.  All right.  Yeah, and go Pittsburgh.  Definitely Pittsburgh this weekend.  That's my own town.  Are you insane?  Yeah, we'll see.  We're laughing.  We'll see.  We'll see.  Wow.  Wow.  Not hearing Philly.  Oh, no, no.  Everyone's entitled.  We're a hearted eagle country.  I wasn't there to represent my hometown.  So you're from Pittsburgh, lived in Florida, and now you're in Philly.  Yeah, I grew up in Philly.  Okay, there you go. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  Who else we got here?  Who's the pouty girl?  I'm Nikki.  You're very cute.  Hi.  Are you scared or something?  I'm terrified.  Oh, you're why?  Wow, she's shaking.  Put your hand out.  Put your hand out.  Look at this.  Wow.  Like Michael J. Fox.  Oh, come on.  Could you just sit in the backseat of my car shaking like that and say, where are we going?  Where are we going?  I wish I could shake a little bit.  Please.  And I'll just say, ah, I'm picking up from school.  Your mom's in the hospital.  Quick, get in. 
[02:34:00]  There's an emergency at home.  Your mom sent me.  Why are you shaking?  I'm terrified.  Are you?  I'm so shy.  This is like not me.  Well, you know, you got a little blue number on there.  What is that?  It's purple.  I know.  I'm a friggin' idiot.  I'm an ass.  This is going to help you in the competition.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Look at Rick.  Rick, how many girls do you still have to take pictures of?  One, two, three, four, eight.  Eight.  One, two, three, four, eight.  I said that we'd have 20 girls today, and I think we're right around that mark. 
[02:34:30]  Hell yeah.  Are all the guys boyfriends?  Are all the guys boyfriends?  I just want to know which one I can't hit on.  Any of them, Norton.  That tough guy just pointed at the blonde, so there you go.  That's bigger than me guys' wife, right?  That's just his wife.  Oh, really?  Hi, I'm Beth.  Yeah, get on my...  Hi, I'm Beth.  Sean, you suck.  You broke up with her?  Ah, we like it.  Very nice.  That and you two are hooked up over here.  Actually, I broke up with her.  You did?  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  Dude, you better have been trading up.  I don't know.  I'm kicking myself right now.  Really?  Wait, you guys used to go out.  You brought her down here, but you're broken up now.  Yeah.  Why was it?  Why'd you break up?  What happened?  What went wrong?  Well, actually, it got kind of difficult.  My ex-girlfriend went away to Europe, so I met this girl, beautiful girl here, and  we started going out.  Yeah, and then she came back.  And the ex-girlfriend came back, so I didn't want to hurt anyone, so I'm kind of like...  I cut myself off for a while.  So you got rid of both of them?  I'm taking a vow of chastity for a while.  But listen, no, no, no. 
[02:35:30]  Who's she?  Hey!  Listen.  Moron.  No, no, listen, Forrest Gump.  You're yelling moron.  Sucky.  What's up, Norton?  You can't work, too?  I just wanted to ask Forrest Gump hairdo, why did you break up with her?  She's so pretty.  I don't know.  We'll see.  All right.  Get back with him.  It's shot.  Hey, you better have something in the magazine there.  Do you have a boyfriend now?  Someone you're seeing?  No.  No.  I was talking to him.  No, stop it.  I'm kidding, of course.  No, you don't have a boyfriend?  No. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, why are you guys getting back together again?  I'll be doing myself, definitely.  Anthony, I've got to interrupt you.  What's going on over there?  Oh, there's a little costume change going on behind a coat.  Oh, don't move the coat.  What are you doing?  We're all friends.  Yeah, we're all one big happy family.  We're one big lousy.  Wow, that was a quick change.  Another one with the leopard motif.  Well, high five.  She changed her naughty nightie.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Everyone's just having fun.  I know. 
[02:36:30]  Everyone's having a ton of fun here.  Yes, sir.  We could have a special showing of a kitty cat here.  Oh, oh, oh, look how he's talking in code.  You're good.  I hope you're talking in code and you don't mean an actual kitty cat.  Norton, I'm sure you would enjoy this.  Norton, you want to take a gander?  Beyond belief.  All right.  Is there a reason why?  Which girl?  Which girl?  As long as kitty cat doesn't mean yambang.  Negative.  Negative.  Oh, okay, got it.  Where?  Beth will show you her kitty.  All right.  Norton, take a look. 
[02:37:00]  All right.  All right, let's go on.  Ready?  And?  Beth, Beth, Beth, Beth.  I can't see it.  There's no shying out now.  Beth, Beth, Beth, Beth, Beth, Beth, Beth.  Come on.  There's no shying out now.  Oh, my God.  Oh, she actually has a cat on the cat's face right there.  Come on, now.  Yes.  Right over.  Oh, come on.  I mean, it's right on top of.  Yeah, we got to see the mouth.  We got to see the rest.  Come on.  You got to leave her to the imagination. 
[02:37:30]  Imagination.  Come on, just to be silly.  Just to be silly.  That's really cool.  Really fast, really fast.  Yeah.  Just real fast.  Just really quick.  Complete the picture.  I want to see what it looks like.  Oh, imagination.  Imagination.  I look fast.  We're leaving it to the imagination of the listeners.  That's good enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't have an imagination.  I kind of wanted to see what it would look like if Mars the cat got his throat slit.  I don't want to see what it would look like if Mars the cat got his throat slit.  I don't want to see what it would look like.  Yeah.  It's almost like all you need is the tamp string like a Colombian necktie.  Look, he's got a collar. 
[02:38:00]  They were really, really hot.  Oh.  Thank you.  The bald head.  Thank you.  I like your bad eyesight.  20th girl finally turned to hot.  Wow.  Hey, Beth, did that hurt?  Didn't that touch you like that?  Yeah, it did hurt very bad.  Well, the outline.  Uh-huh.  Geez.  Sorry.  The outline hurt too.  Then he used the lidocaine jelly, which I was calling.  Oh, there you go.  Wow. 
[02:38:30]  That's a hell of a place for a tap.  Oh, Anthony, I've got to interrupt.  Yes, yes.  Foz from Cleveland checking in again.  Cleveland is gold.  Foz.  Foz, what's up, man?  What's up, man?  I got four girls in here at the same time.  Four girls.  Hi, baby.  Hello.  Okay, girls.  Let me make sure I get this right.  I got Dee, Beth, what's your name?  Jessica.  Jessica.  Sheila.  And Sheila.  Dude, what's up with Cleveland, man?  Woo!  At this point, the naughty man.  Wait, when are you guys coming to Cleveland? 
[02:39:00]  It's a two-horse race right now.  Yeah.  Between Philly and Cleveland.  Philly and Cleveland.  Philly and Philly.  New York, you have let us down, man.  Well, New York, we'll be back Monday.  You've got to come to the table strong starting Monday.  As the qualifying continues for the naughty night again.  Guys, guys, Cleveland is out to win this contest.  I'm telling you.  Well, you're doing a good job.  Yes, come on.  Thanks, guys.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  She wants to know when we're coming to Cleveland.  We're going to have to do it soon.  We're closer now than we are if we go home.  Let's just go. 
[02:39:30]  Road trip.  Road trip.  We can leave tonight.  Who cares about TLA?  Look at you.  Another girl on Norton's lap, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  How does that happen?  And this one's got her leg.  She's got her leg bent.  Her foot is on one of Norton's legs.  Her ass is on the other.  And Norton grabbing on for dear life.  Yeah, I'm just holding her ankles.  This is like kind of just holding her so she doesn't fall.  It's not necessarily restrained.  Yes, of course.  That comes later.  You know, restraints, the screaming, the charges pressed later. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, sure.  All right, four more girls from Cleveland in.  Yeah.  Thank you, Cleveland, today.  Coming to the table.  You know, we can play What Do We Learned on the Opie and Anthony show.  I think it was very educational.  This was like a day at college.  College?  The education people.  Oh, sure.  The Muthier Museum.  Saw a lot of freaky things to start our day.  We saw fetuses and then where they came from.  Which is just a great, great day.  If you ask me. 
[02:40:30]  It's all connected if you really think about it.  The show's come full circle.  Right.  Are we going to be able to get all these girls' pictures taken?  I sure hope so.  Yeah, Rick will work overtime on this one.  Yeah.  Dude, I don't feel so bad anymore.  I thought I was going to...  Oh, you can't say that?  You know that E word.  They don't want it.  Yeah.  E word.  Yeah, yeah.  Two E words we can't use.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were all excited when you walked out of the...  Vanirond.  Right. 
[02:41:00]  Of course.  You know.  As you probably do now.  What do you call pickled bread?  Pickled bread?  What?  I don't know.  A dildo.  Oh.  Dildo.  Dildo.  All right.  You pickle things with dill.  She's happy.  And it's dough.  We could all proud of ourselves.  Yeah.  Hey, my girl is funny.  We're telling jokes.  What does the sign say above the whorehouse?  I don't know.  What does the sign say above the whorehouse?  Beat it.  We're closed.  Beat it.  You know. 
[02:41:30]  And so many girls have a sense of humor, too.  Yeah.  They do.  I can't wait until her face is all beet red.  Norton's hands around her throat going, tell me another joke, bitch.  You know, because it's going to happen.  Promise?  He will kill you.  When the punchline is, ow, that's my balloon nod, Jim.  Oh, we'll elbow each other.  Now that's a joke.  It's the pinky thing with the...  Oh, it was Schubert.  The old pinky trick.  A pinky. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Why don't we go to the phone and see what's going on here?  And we'll play What Do We Learn, right?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Let's go to Kerry.  Thank you.  We'll start with Kerry.  Hey, Kerry, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to play What I Learned Today.  Okay.  I learned that there's going to be a new daily feature on the Open Anthony Show.  Every day at 6.15, we're going to have the daily sexual assault.  Yes.  It all seemed to be that way, yeah.  Have a good night, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jeff on line three there.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  How are you guys doing? 
[02:42:30]  What I learned today from that girl's mom was you can't get pregnant.  You can't get pregnant by a finger.  That's right.  We did learn that from Allison.  Let's go to Doug from Springfield.  Doug.  Hey, Doug.  What's up, guys?  I learned that the ratings in Washington and the hot girl sitting on Norton's lap is the same thing.  Nothing's going to happen.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  You're right.  Have a good time, guys.  Thank you, Doug.  A bash within a bash. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  That was good.  Let's go to Chris on line.  I don't know.  They're eight or so.  Hey, Chris.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, I learned that Norton is an apist.  Right.  I didn't learn that.  Three rights.  Still make a left.  All right.  Let's go to Rod.  Black some wine.  Let's go to Rod.  Line one on the national line, it looks like.  Dude, so what do you think, though?  That mother-daughter team.  Think they'll double up on you?  The mother-daughter thing?  I think they made out for us once.  Didn't you?  No, no.  They didn't do that.  The mom felt up the daughter. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  That sounds like quality.  A little juggling.  A little juggling going on.  You're disgusted.  Look at these two.  You're back together again, aren't you?  Yeah.  You're going to be effing her tonight, aren't you?  I'm sorry.  Hang tough, dude.  Oh, for real?  Definitely.  He came in already, Ed.  Yeah.  You're going to be effing her tonight.  Remember, Norton, it's not rape, it's surprise sex.  Good point.  Wow.  That's funny.  Gee.  Just put on a little party hat.  Surprise! 
[02:44:00]  Wow, it's a hammer clunk.  Let's go to Justin on line two, national.  Hey, Justin, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  I learned today that today's queef for the day sounded a lot like a flag in high wind.  That's not a bad thing.  Thanks, guys.  All right, man.  It did have some volume to it.  Dave, outside the studio.  Outside WISP wants to say something.  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I learned that I've been number one fan from day one. 
[02:44:30]  Why don't you guys let me have me and my boy up there for a beer?  That'd be nice.  He wants to come up for a beer.  We got a beer with you, boys.  We got like ten minutes.  Dave, we're leaving in two minutes.  We got to jump in some police cars, I think.  I learned you should have called earlier.  We'd have had you up.  Lauren's been looking at the window all night with the WOW Nazi banners on my arms.  We're from that Wednesday.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Let's go to BJ outside. 
[02:45:00]  Poor guy.  BJ.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, BJ?  What's going on?  You're on the radio.  Go.  I want to play what you learned today.  Oh, yeah.  Is he listening to the broadcast outside?  We learned that we're on like a three-minute delay.  Hey, stupid ass.  BJ.  You're on now.  Talk.  Yeah, that's what I had to say.  I'm outside freezing my game bags off.  Show me something.  All right.  Well, the girls are coming out in a few minutes here, all right?  Yeah, bring them down. 
[02:45:30]  Bring them down.  Bring that one.  We'll bring them all down.  You slam it.  We'll do one more, and then we'll stop at phone calls.  Let's go to Ryan.  Yo.  Hey, Ryan, what's up?  You there?  Yeah, speak, man.  Wow.  Yo, I just want to say I learned that the best place for interracial couples to get it on  is at the Tarzane Room.  And also working at 6 o'clock week, end up at 6.30 when they have a flat tire.  Good deal.  Good job.  Speaking of that, we'll have Keisha on the show next week. 
[02:46:00]  I think that's going to happen.  I think a girl's going to lose her virginity live on our show.  Yes.  I think we put that together today.  Who are you?  Get up to that mic over here.  I can't believe this guy dumped that girl, and he's getting her back tonight.  Hey, you shouldn't have sex with him.  He screwed you over, man.  Lottery.  What?  Oh.  Ah, good.  He might not do that tonight, dude. 
[02:46:30]  Let him think he's going to get some.  You know, I'm a great way to make him jealous.  I was taking on a nice romantic date to see Norton at the TLA tonight.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  And look at Jenna, our last girl of the day, I think.  Hey, how you doing?  Welcome.  How are you?  Here, step right up.  I'm sorry, South Philly?  Yeah, cool.  And you're down here for the contest.  Look, she's wearing a little net mesh thing.  Kind of short-teach-ish.  I rushed from work from 20th and Market, and I'm so glad you got to see me last, at least.  There you go.  Right at the end. 
[02:47:00]  Boy, we are.  We have a lot of finalists right here in the studio, don't you think?  Yes.  Lots and lots of finalists.  Finalists all over the place.  What a day.  Big round for all the girls, all the beautiful women we've had here today.  We've got to get out of here.  We've got to thank Tim Sabian for having us once again.  Jimmy Schubert, he's playing the Stress Factory.  Keith Robinson, who's opening up for Jim Norton tonight.  Jackie, and of course, all the girls.  All the girls.  We took all the girls Norton's molested during the day.  The one he's doing now. 
[02:47:30]  We've taken a lot of pictures, and they'll be up on opiananthony.com later on tonight.  Yes.  So be patient with that, right?  Yes.  And I guess we've got to get out of here.  Uh-huh.  I think we're going to the indoor lacrosse game.  We'll be there in a few minutes, all right?  Have a great weekend.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.
