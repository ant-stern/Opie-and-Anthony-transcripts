<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about Jim Norton's involvement in a recurring segment where buckets of what was implied to be feces ("A's") were thrown at someone.  Following this, they took a couple of listener calls.  A caller from Washington D.C. enthusiastically expressed his pleasure at the show's syndication in his area.  This was followed by a call from a listener named Rob who angrily and vehemently criticized the show's new lineup using strong, profane language. Opie responded to Rob's criticism, explaining the difficulties of entering a new market and the typical negative initial reactions from listeners before they adapt to the show. The conversation shifted to the challenge of competing with long-running local radio shows, using the example of Don and Mike's fifteen-year run in Washington D.C.  The hosts also briefly mentioned that some of their shows were now live, citing Ron and Fez as an example. The segment ended with a short mention of a technical glitch on another station where Loveline repeatedly aired instead of the scheduled programming, with no further explanation provided.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. Hey! Man. Hey, what's new, Anthony? A whole lot, I guess, huh? How about an S bucket of A's? No S. Hey, Norton, they're ripping you off. South Park using your lines now, Jim Norton. Yeah. Who came up with the throwing a bucket of A's at somebody? That would be our own Jim Norton.  Pal Jim Norton right here. My God. Let's go right to the phones, Ant. Bill, what's going on? 
[00:00:30]  Just want to say, guys, thank you so much for coming down here finally. I moved down to D.C. about 12 months ago, 14 months ago. Yeah.  I've been telling everybody about you guys ever since then because I know you guys have all been talking about syndication.  Well, the only positive call I think we'll get from D.C. all day. Oh, I'm finally vindicated now that you guys are on the air down here.  People will understand that I'm not just talking out my a-hole. All right, well. Well, it'll take a little while.  Look at that. We're one for one. We're going to stop right there. We're not taking any more phone calls today. 
[00:01:00]  That's it. That's it. Bastards. Thanks, man. I appreciate it. Thank you guys very much.  All right, bro. Let's go to Rob. Hey, Rob, what's going on?  Yo, yo, yo. What's up, yo? What's up? It sucks. The new lineup sucks. Not in my manner.  All right, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Rob, I'm not going to play this game today.  Why?  Because you're not going to like anything the first time you hear it.  Yeah, but they... All right, they're old. They're old. 
[00:01:30]  Dude, relax with the language.  Now, you've been with us and you've seen us go into these other cities and you've seen the feedback and response we get in these other cities.  And what is it? Shut up. You suck. Get off the air. Blah, blah, blah.  And then after a few weeks, a month goes by, you have to get to know the people.  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Check it out. Check it out.  Shut up a minute.  I'm from the city.  Hold on.  I'm here.  Go in.  And you have to get to know the participants and the people and whatever's going on. 
[00:02:00]  And then after a while, then you make your decision.  I made my decision before. They suck.  Before when they were...  All right, listen.  We can't play this game today.  We're not doing this.  Can't do it. We know how this game works.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, we've been at the receiving end of this lately.  Way too many times.  You know, it might have been a little easier to do a few months back.  You think they're digging us in Washington right now? Washington, D.C.?  No.  I don't think so.  Don and Mike have been number one in Washington on JFK for 15 years. 
[00:02:30]  And now we slide in there.  And hi. How you doing?  Hi. It's Opie and Anthony.  People are like, who the F are you?  Get off the air.  This is not what we are used to.  You suck.  So, you know, you've got to give the shows a chance.  If after a month, two months, whatever, you still think they suck or we suck, fine.  Then find something else to entertain yourself with.  But you can't just, after 10 minutes or one show, go, you suck. 
[00:03:00]  Okay? Thank you.  That's my statement.  That's a good statement.  Now go F off.  All right. Let's bring in the next stripper.  Yeah. It's just not going to work if you do that.  Right.  I think the lineup we have has promise.  Yeah. There you go.  I wish they'd pick something and stick with it.  We finally got shows that are all live.  That's a start.  Are they all live?  They're all live now.  Hold on.  Sports guys.  Okay. They're live.  All right. 
[00:03:30]  We're talking about they're live.  We're talking about the New York, obviously.  We're live.  Mm-hmm.  And Ron and Fez live.  Wow.  How did that happen?  Woo.  Did anyone tune in to N.E.W. this weekend and not hear Lovelines?  What?  Did someone screw up and just have a continuous tape loop of Lovelines all weekend long?  You have to explain for the rest of the country.  Uh, this station, uh...  This station, uh... </pre>
