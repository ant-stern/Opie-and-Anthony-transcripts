<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a sneeze, quickly transitioning to a satirical commentary on the New York Post's news priorities, focusing on Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn over Hurricane Wilma and Saddam Hussein's trial.  They mocked Bono's meeting with President Bush, playing audio clips of the encounter, and questioned Oprah's book choices and self-importance.  The hosts then debated the phenomenon of actors claiming expertise based on their roles, using examples like Elvis and Nixon, and criticized Charlize Theron's performance in "Monster."  Anthony revealed his recent purchase of a shotgun for home defense, showing photos and discussing home invasions in his neighborhood.  He shared humorous photoshopped images of himself with the shotgun and recounted childhood experiences with firearms.  Comedian Bill Burr joined the show in studio, relating a bizarre plane story about a woman frantically calling for "Frank." The show also included discussion of the "Assault on the Media" contest, Imus’s commentary, Opie's brother's T-shirts,  a remixed audio clip of President Bush's speech set to U2's "Sunday Bloody Sunday," and promotion of their Halloween party and merchandise.

The show continued with a discussion of photoshopped images from whackbag.com, followed by a call from Rich in D.C. reporting on Howard Stern's declining ratings in the area, contrasted with the success of local shows.  They highlighted entries from their "Assault on the Media" contest, including "John from New Jersey" and a new contestant subtly disrupting a news report.  The hosts further discussed their upcoming Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe, touching upon the "secret guest list" and an incident with "No Filter Paul."  A significant portion of the show featured audio clips from various tribute bands (Carpenters, Tom Jones, U2, Boston), with guest Brother Joe providing commentary and a lengthy anecdote about his feud with a former U2 tribute band singer, Laird, punctuated by the running joke about "shooting the hostage."

Further discussion centered on tribute bands performing at their Halloween party, including Brother Joe’s U2 band and Live Wire (an AC/DC tribute band).  Technical difficulties playing a Live Wire DVD led to a discussion of older media formats.  The hosts interacted with the musicians, and a studio guitarist called to discuss equipment (Korg AX1500G).  The show prominently featured "Wheel," a listener who repeatedly interrupted live television news reports, playing audio clips of these incidents and discussing strategies for future "assaults."  A humorous bit included a listener's Brad Garrett impression, and they discussed a new promo by Steve featuring "pests." Listener calls followed, along with a discussion of a new word ("shwogie"), and a song by the Kaplan Brothers.  The show concluded with discussion of Hurricane Wilma and Opie's plans to travel to Florida despite evacuation orders.  The broadcast was liberally punctuated with profanity and sexually explicit language.

A segment focused heavily on Hurricane Wilma and its potential impact on the hosts’ Florida trip, featuring contrasting caller opinions on the storm's severity and the hosts' humorous speculation on possible flight rerouting.  Dee Dee pitched her new radio show, "Two Chicks and a Dick," leading to playful teasing and discussion of its format and co-hosts.  Audio clips from the show were played, and the hosts discussed death threats against Johnny Carson, a *New York Post* story, articles from *Giant Magazine*, U2 tribute bands, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Silverman, *The Apprentice*, and *Ghost Whisperer*. Dee Dee’s XM golden ticket audition was also featured.

Finally, a caller, Harry from Buffalo, reported on the low listenership and IQ of a rival XM show, "Bubba Bo," prompting skepticism and plans to play audio from the show.  The segment included shout-outs to "Two Chicks and a Dick.com," Jamie from *Giant Magazine*, and Billbird's tour. The show ended abruptly.

[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you.  Shut your goddamn piehole.  Can't you talk.  Can't you talk for a force.  I am a lucky kid.  I know a thing to do.  I know a thing to do.  I know a thing to do about a thing to do. 
[00:05:30]  What's happening?  This is the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Hello, exactly.  Hello, exactly.  Hello, exactly.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Slowly, but surely.  I have a sneeze gearing up.  I have a sneeze gearing up.  Yeah.  I have a sneeze gearing up.  Yeah.  It won't come out.  It just sits there, kind of behind your eyeballs.  I hate that.  Stare right at that light.  Yeah.  There ain't no light.  No, that one? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  You need, like, the sun.  No, no.  Get your face right up in it.  It's past.  It's gone now.  No, just dip the lamp toward your nose.  Oh, that's it?  Yeah.  You'll sneeze like crazy.  See a nice big bright spot until noon.  Burn out your retina.  Yeah.  A retina tattoo.  We have so much to do today.  So much to do.  Oh, no.  You make it sound like work, and now I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home. 
[00:06:30]  No, we really have a lot to do.  Yes.  Very important news.  Jen's lap dance.  Jen and Vince Vaughn are an item, I guess, because the New York Post is telling us so.  Wow.  Hot kiss for new love.  That's front page of the Post.  Front page of the Post.  Slow news day.  Ah, screw Saddam Hussein on trial.  That seems to be his whole take on it, so why not the Post?  Screw Hurricane Wilma.  Ah.  One of the most powerful storms ever.  Ah, it ain't near us yet.  Ah, who cares? 
[00:07:00]  Hitting a few Mexicans right now.  Who cares, right?  Bono meeting Bush.  Ah, who cares?  What could they possibly talk about?  It's all about Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn.  The big kiss.  I love that song you do, that one.  That's a great song.  That song about freedom.  El Cata.  Shut up.  We've got to stay the course.  Shut up.  Bono, how did Bono not just punch him in the face?  Streets have no name. 
[00:07:30]  It's in Iraq.  Because it blew them all up.  We're trying to get him in there.  Main Street, USA.  That'd be a good street.  Bad day.  Shut up.  And how did Bush not punch Bono?  Both of them just duke it out because they both, you know, you know they both just hate  each other and what each other stand for.  Yeah.  There's an opposite thing.  Yeah.  Bono doesn't have any sort of a God complex at this point, does he?  No.  Not at all.  I guess when you sell out, like, Giant Stadium 900 million times, the only other rush you 
[00:08:00]  can get is to, like, save the world.  Save the world.  That's what they, you know, you're absolutely right.  That's kind of the next step.  They're so bored with what they've done their whole life because they've reached the pinnacle.  People like Madonna.  Same thing.  Yeah.  How many times can you be called a genius?  Yeah.  You are so, you know, you're the music and you've stayed over the years.  You're able to adapt and stuff.  Yeah.  Two groupies blowing them and he's, like, nodding off.  What happened?  How many blowjobs does this make, guys?  We lost count, Bono. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  Yeah, I really got to save the world or something.  Just super Bono with a cape.  She just becomes a superhero.  That's like Oprah.  Oprah, she's trying to save the world now.  Yeah.  She's actually trying to fill the void of never having kids and now she's trying to raise  all of us.  Raise everybody else.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Oprah for president.  God, that's such...  She just talks about relationships.  It's like you've never been married.  Yeah.  But I have a TV show.  That means I'm qualified. 
[00:09:00]  She's an expert.  I'm a billionaire.  All right.  Well, apparently people want to listen to people like that.  They tune in and buy the books she requests.  Take her advice.  She's reading all of them.  I mean, it's...  Every single one of those books she reads through.  Do you think she's just laying in bed in this palatial bedroom, just thumbing?  She's not reading any of them.  This is interesting.  No, she's got an assistant that just gives her the cliff notes.  She's got a room full of college interns. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  That she pays no money, I bet.  What's this book about?  Oh, Oprah.  It was very good.  Okay.  She's got a chart on the wall that says Oprah's Sensibilities, and it has to hit like, you  know, eight out of ten.  Right, right.  Got to hit the criteria.  Checklist to move to like, to the next level.  It's like, oh, good.  Okay, I like that.  Give her an outline.  How many books do you have to read?  It's actually like, recommend one.  Yeah.  To the whole country.  Do you have to read like, at least what?  Eight to ten of them?  She's holding up a 300-page book every ten days.  It's like 3,000 pages.  And she never gets a lemon where she comes on her show and goes, you know, I read ten books, 
[00:10:00]  and all of them stunk.  While starring and producing in my own show, running a magazine, and going to award shows.  Right.  I'm reading 3,000 pages every ten days.  And they all stunk, so I can't recommend one this time around.  No.  All right.  You want to hear some Bush clips with Bono?  Oh, we got some?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, we got a couple clips from Bush meeting Bono.  Great job.  Great job.  We stayed a course.  Shut up.  Let's play the first one here.  YouTube frontman Bono stopped by the White House for lunch with President Bush. 
[00:10:30]  Hello.  Bono and President Bush had lunch for nearly two hours in a private dining room off the Oval Office.  White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan says they discussed debt relief, AIDS, malaria, and world trade.  Bono told Rolling Stone magazine before the meeting he wasn't afraid to meet the president or any world leader.  He says they should be afraid to meet him because he represents the poor and he's throwing a punch.  Bono's lunch with the president wasn't completely full of heavy issues.  McClellan says the two also discussed rock and roll because you two are in Washington on tour. 
[00:11:00]  Margie's Arletta, Washington.  He's absolutely not representing the poor.  He represents the poor, Bono.  I went to a U2 show recently.  He's not representing the poor.  We're getting poor by going to see U2.  Ticket prices are outrageous.  Representing the poor.  That is the most outrageous statement I've ever heard.  He's not representing the poor.  That Bono represents the poor.  Do you know how much it costs to go to a U2 show these days?  I know.  When was the last time he was poor?  1981? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Send Tippy Tom to the White House to talk to Bush.  That's the guy representing the poor.  That is the homeless guy.  Sends some homeless dude to the White House.  I couldn't represent the poor.  I didn't know the class my whole life.  I don't know what it's like to be poor.  Not poor.  No.  This guy's flying around in a private jet representing the poor all over the world.  That's great.  And talking about malaria?  Like, what?  He's the champion of malaria now, too?  What is that?  Isn't that cured? 
[00:12:00]  I don't know.  Who gets malaria?  There's still an area that gets malaria.  They deserve it.  I mean, come on.  I mean, some of these diseases, if they're still happening out there.  And what's Bush going to do about, like, mosquitoes?  Right.  Hey, President, we have to get rid of the fucking mosquitoes?  The fucking mosquitoes?  These are just photographs.  I've got my plates a little full, Bono.  My plate's a little full right now.  I like how it just kind of, the whole conversation just ends into what the fuck they wanted to talk about anyways.  Like, they start talking about rock and roll. 
[00:12:30]  And you know he showed them, like, where the red button was.  Yeah, yeah.  It's where I, you know, if I've got to launch a nuclear missile, I go here.  Here's my hotline.  And the Soviet Union used to give him a call if we had a problem.  We send the groupies in.  I don't think I get groups, too.  I can relate.  How do you think those meetings go down?  They're just, they're face-to-face and they nod a lot.  And then Bono leaves and then Bush just goes, next?  Yeah.  Like, is anything really accomplished by Bono meeting the President of the United States? 
[00:13:00]  Well, at what point did, like, these entertainers all of a sudden have this level of credibility?  It's like, Ben Affleck to go to the Pentagon today and discuss the Iraqi war.  Did it start with Elvis and Nixon?  Because I know Elvis and Nixon.  Well, that was a biggie.  What's going on?  A mic is on somewhere?  I don't know.  I hear Steve.  Oh, I hope Steve talks.  Let's see what they're talking about.  Okay, Steve.  Think he's going to talk smack on us?  I hope so.  There's, I don't know, maybe there's a wireless mic out there or something.  That's weird.  Anyway, why can we, why can we... 
[00:13:30]  Why are we hearing Steve's conversation?  Why are we hearing Steve's perfectly clear?  Is there a wireless mic on out there?  Is there a wireless mic?  Steve, why were we hearing you?  And what were you talking about?  He's got a booming voice, so...  No, it wasn't one of those, like...  Now look at Steve looking up at the ceiling, like, looking for a wire.  Is it bugged?  Is there a...  The thing is on top of the ceiling.  The, um...  What is?  Smoke detector?  The transmitter for the, uh...  For the wireless is on top of the ceiling.  Wireless, but...  But was a mic on?  If you guys heard me, probably, but... 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, it was.  What were you saying?  There was an outside mic on?  Oh, I was just telling Eric that the, uh...  Assault promos were, uh...  On his console.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into the assault on the media thing.  Holy crap, we'll get into it.  Yeah, if someone...  It's taking on, uh, uh...  A new level, I guess?  Yeah, someone, uh...  Actually started taking our advice and just carrying on a little conversation.  Yeah, but first we want to finish this conversation.  So you were talking about Nixon and, uh...  Yeah, Nixon and, uh, Elvis.  Right.  I know.  I don't know.  I think it might have started there.  Because Elvis, uh, was invited to the White House by Richard Nixon. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Uh, it was part of Nixon's plan to help out getting the kids off drugs.  This is just the dumbest...  Like, you think Bush is stupid?  Boy, that helped.  You think Bush is stupid?  Like, a lot of the stuff he does.  Some of the older presidents, uh, some of the stuff they did was just ridiculously stupid.  He thought Elvis would be a great way to get the kids.  Like, that was Nixon's idea of who the kids enjoyed at that time.  You know, late, uh, early 70s around there. 
[00:15:00]  Sure.  Was, was Elvis Presley.  So he invites him in and actually makes him an honorary member of the DEA.  Gave him a badge and everything.  Where he had a, a, a drug enforcement agency badge.  And Elvis would go around and make traffic stops.  He would stop people.  And be like, you know, hi, I'm Elvis Presley.  A member of the DEA, you know, to drive safe.  You know, people would freak out like, holy shit.  Drugs.  Elvis just, yeah, you got any drugs on here? 
[00:15:30]  Because I really need some.  I'm hurting real bad.  And, uh.  I need them, man.  This doesn't look like Tylenol.  But it is here.  And he was, uh, that was like, he was, I think he was, like, one of the first presidents to kind of use celebrity.  Yeah.  And then they all realized that celebrities were kind of the way to get to the American people.  American people like celebrities.  If I like that celebrity, put two and two together, then the people are going to like me.  I think celebrities should just shut up and perform for us. 
[00:16:00]  You know?  Well, a lot of them do, but a few of them.  My favorite thing, my favorite thing is when one of these high profile movies come out,  all of a sudden the actor that's in the movie is now an expert on that topic.  Oh, that, that.  Holy shit, that drives me nuts.  That started with Kung Fu.  David Carradine.  David Carradine actually thought he was a Kung Fu expert.  He didn't know a goddamn thing about it.  He was raised by those monks or whatever the hell they were.  He was a white man with squinty eyes, and that's how he got the part.  Right.  And all of a sudden he knows how to throw like that. 
[00:16:30]  He was a Shaolin warrior.  Oh, yeah.  But they're on all the news programs as an expert now on this topic just because they're making a movie on this.  Yeah.  And then as soon as the movie leaves the theaters, they're not an expert on that anymore.  They're now an expert on something new.  Any of these actors or actresses, when they're being interviewed on that topic, and they sit there and say,  well, she's such a strong woman, and she has taught me so much.  It's the character they're playing.  Yeah.  And they carry on as if it's a completely real person. 
[00:17:00]  You know, I learned so much from her, and she's so much stronger than I am.  Yeah.  You're playing the part.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Oh, I can't want to strangle the person more.  Shut up and tell us who you're fucking.  That's all we care about.  That's it.  It's you.  I was glad the shoot was over because I just couldn't go to those emotional places anymore.  Right.  Yeah.  It was too painful.  Too painful for me.  You know, there are some characters that I play that it takes me months to really get out of it and stop feeling that emotion that I was, stop it. 
[00:17:30]  Stop it.  Do you think for a minute when I was working that I would leave a house and go, you know, for months I thought, I just hope the air is coming out cold enough out of that air conditioning system because I went in there and installed it, and those people, it's a hot day.  And if they weren't feeling cool, that, it's a job.  You're playing a part. 
[00:18:00]  That's what your job is, idiot.  And sit there and dwell on the fact that I was a soldier and my friends died, man, and I felt the sorrow and, yeah, sure you did.  There are a couple of actors out there who are just complete psychos, and I believe it, but they never say that shit.  No.  It's always like the cheese ball, like, you know.  Yeah, sure.  Somebody in, like, Speed Part 2, literally.  Christian Slater or something.  You're still obsessed with Speed Part 2.  I know, I just had to be in a boat for, like, at some point during the day for the next three months.  I couldn't even go on a cruise, man. 
[00:18:30]  You know, afterwards, after our wrap party, we were all going to go on a cruise, and I couldn't do it because the boat hitting that land and cutting it in half.  I like when an actor, like, gains weight for a part, and they act like it's fucking amazing.  Like, you put on 20 pounds for that role.  It's like, dude, gaining weight is the easiest fucking thing to do.  Everybody in America is doing it right now.  You eat shit food, and you don't exercise.  Probably the easiest thing you could do as a human is gain weight. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, it's gain weight.  And then they always go any time.  I like when any time.  It's impressive when they go the other way, though.  The other way, yeah, big time.  Like Christian Bale.  Christian Bale.  The Machinist.  The Machinist.  Holy crap.  The Machinist is ridiculous.  The guy looks like he weighs, I don't know, 90 pounds.  Yeah, 100.  I think it was like 100 and 20 pounds or something, but he's 6-something.  Yeah, he's a big guy, and he got down to where he looked like a concentration camp.  Oh, yeah, that was brutal.  Unbelievable.  But you were saying.  It's all that shit.  Or like when somebody pretty doesn't wear any makeup, and they'll be like, I was so courageous. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I was so brave.  What movie was that?  Goddamn.  Oh, you know what it was?  It was the Charlize Theron one.  Yeah, yeah.  She played the...  Charlize Theron.  She played the...  Oh, the animal.  Monster.  Serial killer.  The serial killer.  One of the worst movies I ever saw.  They threw...  You didn't like that one?  No, you know, I liked it right in the beginning where the dude's trying to kill her, and she  snaps, and she fucking kills him.  And right there, I'm about to give it a standing ovation.  This is going to be the greatest fucking movie I've ever seen. 
[00:20:00]  Never seen the girl be the psycho serial killer.  Right.  Then all of a sudden, they started to, like, try to make excuses as to why she was killing  these people.  Yeah.  And that it was...  And they had all, like, these cartoon character, like, mean, chauvinistic guys.  Right.  Like, at one point, she's a fucking hooker.  And somehow, not only does she get an interview to be a lawyer, she gets in there with the head  guy, gets past the secretary, and then it's just this...  And that would just be totally, in real life, socially awkward, like, uh, sweetie, uh, you 
[00:20:30]  haven't gone to law school or...  But no, not this guy.  Yeah.  He's like, let me tell you something, you dumb broad.  Yeah.  You ain't ever gonna be a fucking lawyer, cause I got a dick, and you got a cunt.  So why don't you fucking let me stick it in your ass, and then get out of this office,  cause I'm a guy!  And that's why you're killing people.  Oh, man!  It was so fucking irritating.  It's like, when you saw, like, uh, Dahmer, did you ever see that?  Yeah.  At no point did they make any excuses as to why he was a creep. 
[00:21:00]  To try to get some sympathy for the character.  And that's how they show.  Yeah, it wasn't any point like, you know, you know, my uncle shoved a tuna fish sandwich  up my ass when I was a kid, and ever since then, I confused food with violence.  Yeah.  And then I feel bad for him.  No, he was, he was a maniac.  Goddamn, that law office scene is so perfect.  Yeah, cause any normal guy would be like, you know, your resume, you really don't have  anything here, um, sorry, you know, but they had to go the Lifetime movie route, where, 
[00:21:30]  and, cause any time you watch a movie on Lifetime, it's like that.  An original Lifetime exclusive, starring Markie Post.  And, and, and she comes in, there's the caricature guys, you know, she'll always hook up with  a guy that romances her, and he's so nice, and then, either after they get married, or  decide to move in together, the guy turns into, you know, hey, get in the kitchen, you  fucking whore, punching her in the face, and she's gotta, you know, pour kerosene on him  while he's sleeping and strike that match. 
[00:22:00]  Exactly.  Cause you know what it is with, with guy stuff, our shit is so on the surface, cause we're,  we don't have, there's nothing subtle about us.  Their stuff is all, like, you know, underground, and you can't see it.  They're sitting there literally across from you in a restaurant, knowing what buttons  to push, they're dialing, like, 1-800-MIND-FUCK in your head.  And then, then you lunge across the table with, like, a bread knife, and then all of a sudden,  they just carry him on.  She just sits there all, you know.  I was sitting there.  Yeah, life comes out of my crotch.  I'm, I'm a daffodil.  And you have, like, no, and the dude's coming out, no, that bitch said, you know. 
[00:22:30]  And that's it.  The bouncer always goes right for the guy.  Right.  She's pushing the buttons like crazy.  That's, that's very good.  Oh, yeah.  I'd be the worst bouncer ever.  I'd be, like, the reverse.  I'd be going up behind the women with, like, a chloroform rag.  Yeah.  Just knocking her up and dragging her off.  She goes, uh, the movie monster, too.  She's in the car with the frigging guy.  She's a hooker.  And he's like, yeah, fuck you, bitch.  Suck my dick.  And, oh, he's not treating her like a lady. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  You know, he's mouthing off to her.  Perhaps he's a little unstable.  Sure he is.  But, you know.  But you are a hooker.  You're in a car with some guy.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  It was guy's fault.  Yeah.  Always the guy's fault.  I mean, no, that's, that's how it works.  We have a bitch, and you can blow their heads off.  Right.  Justified.  We have another clip from Bono meeting the president.  Bono.  That's when he will move on.  Sorry, Derek.  Go ahead.  He's someone who has a lot of influence and is committed to helping people who are in need 
[00:23:30]  and lifting people out of poverty and helping those who are suffering from AIDS.  And those are priorities that the president shares.  Okay.  That's Scott McKellen, the White House press secretary, talking about Bono and how Bush appreciates  Bono's efforts on behalf of the world's poor.  Appreciated.  Appreciates.  Appreciated.  Appreciating, that means nothing.  No, it means nothing.  I appreciate you.  They're worlds apart.  They're worlds apart. 
[00:24:00]  Appreciating something.  It's just one of those words that is overused and means absolutely nothing.  Air breather.  Walks on land.  I could, you know, we're just about the same type of people.  That's hilarious to be meeting with Elvis.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, the Elvis meeting.  That's like meeting with the lead singer of, like, the fine young cannibals right now.  Yeah.  You've got to get the youth.  To get the young people.  Eric in New York, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Morning, Eric.  They took a lot of balls for Debbie Moore to shave her head at G.I. Jane, too. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, that's right.  Ah, yeah.  Very courageous of her to do that.  Like, that ain't growing back.  All right.  Yeah, give me $10 million for a movie.  I'd shave my head.  Yeah.  But I'm sure somebody would sit her down and go, what were you thinking?  Shaving your head.  Oh, my God.  Well, you know.  When I get into a role.  Yeah.  Then she'd launch into that like she never did St. Elmo's Fire.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  General Hospital.  Yeah.  She was in General Hospital, wasn't she?  And then she's got to talk about with that same movie, G.I. Jane. 
[00:25:00]  Well, you know, it was a little rough at first.  But after a while, I was just one of the guys just hanging out.  Because it was just a me and a set full of guys, and we were...  One of the guys, sure.  One of the guys.  One of the guys.  Even like the psycho shape that they get into.  It's like you have a personal trainer, personal chef, all that type of stuff.  And it's just like, yeah, if I had like the stress of knowing that I was going to take off my shirt.  Yeah.  And my pasty torso was going to be showing in front of the whole country.  That would be enough motivation.  The humiliation, if you're even remotely out of shape. 
[00:25:30]  And that's part of your job that day, you know, or for the period of time that you're doing that movie.  Part of your job is getting into that shape.  So it's not like, you know, you have to leave work early or before you work, you're going to the gym like normal people do.  So that's part of it.  I'm sure on the set was a gym for her and the trainer, and they'd do that in the morning, and then she'd go and shoot some stuff.  Yeah, it's never as rough as they want to make it sound.  The personal chef, you know, like that whore that you live with? 
[00:26:00]  Right, my personal chef.  That's the biggie, because you don't have to think anymore.  Right.  If you're driving down the street, there's no, oh, I should go to McDonald's and just shove, you know, a salad in your face, maybe take their tits out like at your house.  That never happens.  She is a responsible married woman who just comes and cooks healthy food.  What about that story you were telling off the air, though?  Remember that one, Opie?  The one that had nothing to do with a cook that comes over my house?  Let me tell you something, Bill.  Usually I would jump on the bandwagon and I would help you out in this situation, but my friend Anthony just bought a shotgun. 
[00:26:30]  You better watch it, pally.  Better watch where you go now.  I am an armed citizen.  Listen, I am part of the armed citizenry of this country now, my friend.  My pal Anthony bought a shotgun!  I bowed under to the pressure of the media scare tactics, Opie.  I'm admitting it.  They were scaring us here in New York.  They're frightening the people with all these home invasions. 
[00:27:00]  Their home...  There's a picture of me I put up on the website for people to photoshop.  Yeah.  That's your actual gun?  That's my shotgun.  Go to the other one that shows me and my rapier.  I let people photoshop.  What the hell is wrong with you?  There's me and my rapier and my shotgun.  Are these pictures up?  They've already put pictures...  Yeah, they've already cut that one out and put me fighting Errol Flynn in a movie, which is really funny.  They put me in action movies.  It's hysterical what they do with the photoshop.  Back up just slightly for the new listeners. 
[00:27:30]  We're gaining new listeners every day.  Yes.  That's how Anthony used to defend himself.  That was my rapier, and that was my only means of home defense.  He lives on Long Island, and there's an epidemic out there, Bill.  You were in Seattle when we were talking about this yesterday.  I live in Nassau County.  And they're all about the home invasions out there right now.  The one with me just holding the shotgun.  I want someone to photoshop me just in an action figure box.  Doesn't that look like an action figure?  It looks like it's already photoshopped, like you were holding something else in your hand. 
[00:28:00]  And they put a gun in there.  Wow, that's pretty impressive, man.  What kind of gun is that?  That is great.  That is my Remington.  I got my Remington Tactical.  So the same gun the Border Patrol agents use, so I know it can shoot Mexicans.  He bought the gun when you don't know how to shoot.  You get the shotgun.  Just kind of spray it in that general area.  No, for home defense, you want the shotgun.  A lot of people have a lot of different ideas about that.  But it's got the little flashlight right on the pump. 
[00:28:30]  I hit a button on the pump, and the flashlight comes on.  And anything that's in the flashlight is getting hit.  It's wonderful.  It's a wonderful weapon.  Turn the flashlight on and shoot.  That's it.  That's how easy it is.  If you can see it, you can kill it.  That's it.  That's their selling point.  And if you see my rip ear there, I can take his ear when I'm done.  I just cut it right off and hang it up on the wall.  Well, the pictures are up on openanthony.com.  But just to explain it, Bill, there's home invasions happening in Nassau County. 
[00:29:00]  Nassau County home invasions going crazy.  Pretty much in Anthony's area, more or less.  Yeah, it's in the area that I live in.  Now, it's gangs, believe it or not, that are coming from Long Island.  There are Long Island gangs.  The M-18.  Coming from New York.  No, some of them are out on Long Island in Brentwood.  Well, the fat guys are coming from New York, though.  But the fat guys, there's a gang called the Fat Guys.  They're out of Manhattan.  Then there's the M-18.  And then there's the M-something-13.  MS-13?  MS-13. 
[00:29:30]  These are like gangs that have come up from South America.  It's a gang of guys that have MS?  Yeah, they're kind of easy to hit.  Police right now.  There's a task force and a bounty, a $10,000 reward for information leading to the capture  of these bandits in Nassau County.  Police yesterday revealed there was another home break-in Tuesday night in Inwood.  That's not going to be white people.  They're white gangs?  No.  They call them bandits?  No.  Bandits.  They put the kerchief around their mouth. 
[00:30:00]  People of color are called hoodlums.  Hoodlums.  If they're white, they're bandits.  Maybe that's Mexican.  Yeah, Mexican.  They're South American.  They come from South America.  They've formed gangs.  They have that X of bullets.  Yeah, yeah.  Like banditos.  That's what they should call them.  Big sombreros.  Hey, gringo.  What do you have in here?  And they always, especially in the movies, they never seem like it's going to be trouble  when you first come up on them.  Hey, amigo.  What are you doing here?  They're sitting around the campfire.  You just happen to ride up. 
[00:30:30]  And like you think everything's going to be like, well, I'm just looking for a little  water.  I think we have some water for you.  Tell us we have some water.  Hey, those are some big saddlebags you have on your horse.  What do you have in here?  Oh, no.  There's going to be trouble.  Oh, no.  They're all dirty.  There's a freshly raped woman.  Yeah, yeah.  She's very nice, eh, senorita?  Very pretty woman.  Takes his hat off and bows to her like he's going to be a gentleman.  A couple phone calls coming in. 
[00:31:00]  John, go ahead.  Hey, Anthony.  I was wondering if you're going to be doing the Lee Harvey Oswald thing.  They can picture yourselves with their shotgun before you.  Oh, there you go.  That's kind of like what he did.  The pose would go great.  It photoshopped into the black and white Lee Harvey Oswald picture, too.  Yeah, I think the photoshop's going to go crazy on whackbag.com tonight.  The one where he's in the backyard with his gun.  The shotgun is a pistol that he killed Pippet with.  Yeah, exactly.  Very nice.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tony, North Carolina.  Someone put me on the Channel 7 Eyewitness News page along on the Police Forum Home Invasion 
[00:31:30]  Task Force, and it's me with my shotgun.  Radio shock jock Anthony Cumia will be heading up the task force.  He is quoted as saying, I am on Swoogie Patrol.  Oh, God.  So, yeah, I bought into it and went down to find folks down at Coliseum Guns down there,  right in Uniondale, right across from the Nassau Coliseum.  Anthony was a little paranoid yesterday there, Bill.  He was starting to feel like he really needed to protect himself. 
[00:32:00]  They break into the houses.  Here's what they do.  Roving little gangs at about 3 in the morning or so.  They break in to your house.  You're awakened to a gun in your face.  And here's their M.O. so far.  They tie up the family with the phone cords, anything they could get their hands on.  Then they ransack the place, rip you off, and leave after maybe working you over a little bit.  One guy the other day, the male homeowner, had an NYPD shirt on, but he wasn't a cop. 
[00:32:30]  It's one of those guys who just buy the NYPD shirts.  And they went bullshit on him.  They beat him up a little bit, asking him, where's the gun, motherfucker?  Where's the gun?  Assuming he was a cop and had a gun.  So they worked him over.  I'm just a tourist.  Yeah.  That's what he said.  I bought it after 9-11.  Yeah.  I had some support.  I have an FDNY shirt, too.  It's not like I'm putting out fires, guys.  Could you not?  Is the Whitney?  And, yeah, so I'm hearing all these home invasions right around my area, too, which is a little 
[00:33:00]  frightening.  So I figured I'd rearm myself.  I've had guns my whole life.  I've just been through a period of time when I was living in Brooklyn.  Are shotguns the easiest, just to pull that off running to the pillow?  Shotguns.  Well, the easiest would probably be a handgun.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  But you've got to wait seven months to get a handgun.  Oh, you want to kill people now.  Well, that's what happened in the gun store I went into, Coliseum Guns.  A guy was buying a pistol.  So the sales guy takes his ID and stuff and goes upstairs, comes back down, and he goes, 
[00:33:30]  all right, well, come back three days.  The guy had his waiting period.  You know, come back, and we'll go through the rest of this.  And the guy did the Simpsons line, the homer line from the Simpsons.  He goes, but I'm mad now.  They're joking down at the gun store.  It's hysterical.  But I'm mad now.  And then one of the guys that worked there was saying, he goes, what can I help you with?  They go, I need shotgun home security. 
[00:34:00]  And he goes, ah, boy, are we selling these like hotcakes.  He goes, he sold about eight of them in the past two days, eight shotguns.  And he goes, yesterday, some woman came in with an 80-year-old lady, and they both walked out with shotguns.  An 80-year-old woman toting some heat.  God bless America.  That's right, God damn it.  I loved an armed citizenry, because here's when the home invasions will stop going up. 
[00:34:30]  They're going up right now.  They're going up.  Here's when they'll start tapering off.  The first one of these motherfuckers that are laying dead in someone's living room because, oops, wrong house, and they get shot.  Because now it's just easy pickings.  No one's fighting back at all.  They leave their doors open.  Doesn't that make them up the ante?  No, no.  It really makes them go.  What happens is there was a gang of guys that are ripping these houses off. 
[00:35:00]  No research in this.  No, we got a mic in front of us.  We got a mic in front of us.  Hear this mic?  We're experts.  That's all it takes.  Here's what happens.  If you want to be an expert at home, just get a microphone.  You get a gang.  They start ripping off these places.  It makes the news.  Now you get other people sitting back on, you know, something.  Look how easy this is.  These guys have been getting away with this every single time.  Why don't we just go around, check some open doors, look around garages, windows, and start breaking in.  These people don't even fight back.  And it's worked.  And now these things are getting more often. 
[00:35:30]  Can I use the word brazen?  We're brazen.  I love that word.  Very nice.  And it's just going to take somebody.  It has to be daylight hours for it to be brazen.  It would.  Brazen would have to be daylight.  You're right.  Three in the morning isn't very brazen.  Through an open window.  Unarmed house.  That's not brazen at all, is it?  There's nothing brazen about that.  Daylight robbing a precinct.  Let me ask you this question.  That's brazen.  At what point can you shoot them and it's like, it's okay? 
[00:36:00]  If they're walking down the street in my neighborhood and they're of any color but white, then you are completely within your rights to shoot him.  Self-defense.  It is self-defense.  He intended to rob somebody.  That's pretty much it.  I believe the law goes, if you feel that your life is in danger, you can then use deadly force.  Is that gray?  It's kind of gray.  There are some real specifics you have to stick to.  But it really is, if you feel, it doesn't even have to actually be that your life is threatened. 
[00:36:30]  If you feel your life is being threatened, you can take that person's life.  You can use deadly physical force.  If someone's in your house, if they don't show a weapon, they're in your house, but they are menacing you, your family, and you feel that you are in danger of being killed, you can kill that person.  Oh, it'll go through a grand jury and all that shit, you know.  It's not going to be like they come back, pat you on the back, and go, all right, sir, here's your gun. 
[00:37:00]  It's not like the end of Bonanza.  There's always shit.  No, and then whoever you shot, if they don't die, you probably got a lawsuit on your hands.  If they do die, you probably got a family lawsuit on your hands where some lawyer will come out of the woodwork and say this poor individual was just looking for blah, blah, blah.  He was drunk.  He was on drugs.  He thought it was the wrong house.  He needed this, that, the other.  There's always problems.  But the bottom line is it's much better to have to deal with that than it is having to deal with the memory of your wife or girlfriend being raped in front of you. 
[00:37:30]  Has that happened yet?  You being shot.  In these cases of home invasions, no.  That's a very irresponsible statement he just made.  No, because now I'm joking.  Remember what they're going to do, though.  Like it hasn't happened on Long Island?  Like there's never been a home invasion with a rape involved or a murder?  However, it's much better to have to deal with that.  I'd rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6, my friend, if I may quote somebody from Alabama. 
[00:38:00]  So congratulations, Anthony.  I am an armed citizen.  Don't fuck with me, buster.  Yeah, and the pictures are up on opandanthony.com.  A very, very impressive...  You might want to shoot a few times.  Dude, it's not like...  This isn't me running into a gun store never shooting before.  I've probably shot more guns than somebody that's been in the army.  Believe me.  My whole youth was spent shooting weapons. 
[00:38:30]  That's all I did as a kid.  My 13th birthday, I got a pistol.  My father bought me a pistol and a girl for my 13th birthday.  That's what I got.  I got laid and got to shoot a gun off after it.  I got a 10-speed bike.  You knew we had one of those raccoon, those Davy Crockett hats?  Oh, yeah.  Because that was the hit show when he was 18.  I was not.  In 1955.  I was not watching Davy Crockett. 
[00:39:00]  I had a cowboy hat, though.  It was like in a very equestrian area that I grew up in.  Calm down.  And I had the whole schmear.  And I got a holster, a nice low-slung holster.  I had my six-gun that I got for my birthday.  And I'd saddle up my horse and went out there and did some shooting.  And that's what I did.  All right.  And it was nonstop shooting ever since.  We really should take a break.  We have so much show to do.  Yes, we do.  We have Bill Burr in studio. 
[00:39:30]  Sounds like you got a little cold, though, Bill.  Oh, yeah.  You know, flying all over this fucking...  Last we saw Bill, he was doing our show.  And then, like, he had luggage.  And he went to Seattle.  And then he came back the same day.  You never slept in Seattle, right?  No.  You know, I ended up coming back.  And when we landed, the second we landed,  that some lady just started crying hysterically.  It sounded like a baby at first.  Get out of here.  Because it was muffled in a coat.  And then I kind of looked up.  It was two rows.  I mean, fucking wailing.  When you landed? 
[00:40:00]  Yes.  Why?  All of a sudden, it just started wailing.  Was she petrified?  That's what all the stewardess were asking.  Why?  They came over.  Man, man, what is the problem?  What is the problem?  She was like, what?  I mean, screaming, just wailing.  And then thinking, well, what is the problem?  She goes, call 911 and started wailing.  And then she just kept yelling, where is Frank?  Like 90 fucking times.  I don't know if this dude died.  How do you lose someone on a plane?  Well, there's a whole movie about that.  I didn't know if she just landed and she was going to a funeral. 
[00:40:30]  It was this weird thing where it was just like the pain in her voice.  So you had this fucked up combination of like empathy for her.  And then also like, could you please shut the fuck up?  Shut the fuck up, yeah.  Yeah, at least she waited until you guys landed.  If it was in mid-flight, imagine.  Oh, it was awful.  Imagine mid-flight and they can't calm her down.  What a nightmare that would have been.  So then we end up pulling to the gate and ask everybody to,  trying to say in the most friendly voice ever,  she's sitting there wailing and everyone can hear it.  When we pull up to the little jetway, 
[00:41:00]  could everybody just remain in your seats?  A few of the passengers have to get up early.  Yeah.  I'm going to guess it's the person wailing, asking for Frank.  And they just picked, they stood her up and the waitress,  the waitress, the stewardess, backed her way out.  This woman just had her arms like draped around her neck.  Wow.  Like some broken hearted 16 year old.  Yeah.  Where's Frank?  There was a medical emergency.  We were like over like Wisconsin.  So I'm like, I said a little prayer.  Please don't let them have a heart attack. 
[00:41:30]  And please don't let them land this fucking thing.  Keep going.  But nobody was carried off the plane like in a stretcher or anything.  Uh-uh.  So everyone's fine on the plane,  but somehow she freaked out wailing.  Wow.  Wailing when you landed.  That is weird.  And what was the medical emergency?  You ever find out?  No, there was like EMT.  I don't know what his deal was.  Huh.  That's weird.  It was a weird flight.  All right.  Wicky, wacky wild stuff happening on JetBlue.  Yeah, wild.  Hey, how about those planes?  Oh, we got this?  That's good too.  All right, we got so much to do. 
[00:42:00]  When we come back, we might have a new leader in the Assault on the Media contest,  and it was really, really good.  Yeah.  Really good.  And then when I was at Baggage Claim.  Sorry.  Oh, that's interesting.  The video's up on opianthony.com if you want to get a head start on the Assault on the Media thing.  As we go to break, it's the fine president singing U2 Sunday Bloody Sunday.  This makes sense today.  Yes.  Good pick up by Eric.  Bush and Bono met, and we were playing this back, I don't know, six months ago or so.  Some guy took Bush's speeches and got the words to Sunday Bloody Sunday and made this. 
[00:42:30]  Check it out.  There's been a lot of talk about this next song.  This song is not a rebel song.  It's called Sunday Bloody Sunday.  I can't believe the news today.  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long?  How long?  Let's be singing this song. 
[00:43:00]  How long?  Too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight?  We can be as one.  Tonight?  Tonight?  Tonight?  Tonight?  Let's roll. 
[00:43:30]  And the battle's just begun.  This many lost and tell her who has won.  The trenches goes with their hearts.  Mother's, children's, brother's, sister's, corner's heart.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  How long?  How long? 
[00:44:00]  How long?  Must we sing this song?  How long?  Too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight?  We can be as one.  Tonight?  Tonight?  Tonight?  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online.  The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember. 
[00:44:30]  Parkheart.com  Wipe the tears from your eyes.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your shy eyes.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday. 
[00:45:00]  Let's roll.  When it's food, not a meal.  One fact is fiction and TV reality.  And today the name's hot.  We eat and drink while tomorrow they die.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday. 
[00:45:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment.  F***.  Wow.  F***.  F***.  That is such a long way to go just to say F***.  F***. 
[00:46:00]  F***.  Oh, it's the, uh, it's the Opie and Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Bill Burr in studio today.  BillBurr.com.  And Bill Burr on MySpace, right?  Yeah, that Munster tour event.  Bill showed up to work today, Anthony?  Yeah.  Not, not one luggage, but two. 
[00:47:00]  Two, yeah.  Two pieces of luggage, one huge bag.  I guess that's, uh, that's like a, for how long?  Uh, like the next, I don't know, to like a week from this coming Sunday, I won't be in my apartment.  So that's your whole, that's everything you're going to need for, for over a week, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, he came in, uh, double-handed, man, rolling luggage.  I'm like, where are you going?  I hate the huge pack. 
[00:47:30]  Portland, Maine.  Then Providence, Rhode Island, then Boston, then Albany, then L.A., then Buffalo, then  Virginia, and then Atlanta.  Holy crap.  Holy crap.  I'm getting tired just listening to that.  Uh, I miss.  You know who had that same itinerary?  Who?  Who?  Oh, God, he's going to come back to that one.  I'm not going to this.  Charlie Rocket.  Oh, come on, Alfie.  Where were you?  Well, I'm distracted because I see a brother out there.  He came in with a bunch of the guys from Live Wire, and, uh, I think it's just Live Wire  out there. 
[00:48:00]  The ACDC tribute band that's playing our Halloween party.  So we're going to talk to brother Joe.  Oh, I got to see, that was my band when I was in high school.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  You got to hear how good these guys are.  It's amazing.  Yeah, Joe brought some samples and, uh, uh, some samples of some really bad, uh, tribute  bands.  Right.  And then tribute bands where, I don't know why, like, they have a tribute band because  no one sees the original person anymore.  Yeah.  I think he's got a couple of those.  Like the A-Ha tribute band?  Exactly.  No shit.  What?  They have an A-Ha tribute band.  They had one song. 
[00:48:30]  They had one song.  And that's what they were talking about.  Take on me.  A-Ha.  Take on me.  Take on me.  Anyway.  I like that song.  So we're going to get brother Joe in here.  I want to see someone who isn't them sing it.  Oh, yeah.  I'm willing to be.  You know what?  Maybe that's why they're, they, maybe that's why they don't sing it.  You know, you know, it has to be the encore, too, because that's the only song people know.  You can't open with this.  I heard some band that played their hit twice, though. 
[00:49:00]  Didn't Rick say they did it twice?  Was it this band that they opened with it and at the end of the night they closed with  it?  But they jazzed it up a little bit for the ending.  I'm sure.  They must just play it for 20 minutes just because they know everyone's there to hear  this song.  Oh, yeah.  They do the whole audience play along.  Not just the left side.  Yeah.  Come on, right side.  You got to step it up.  Good stuff. 
[00:49:30]  Woo.  Speaking of wacky things that happen in concert.  Yeah.  You're talking about them playing this song maybe twice in concert.  Uh-huh.  I went, I once went and saw Paul Simon.  It was the You Could Call Me Al days.  Ah, of course.  And I went to the show and he plays You Could Call Me Al.  And he has like a hundred musicians on stage, African guys, all sorts of instruments that  you've never seen or heard before.  Uh-huh.  And he just blows out You Could Call Me Al where the whole place is dancing and singing 
[00:50:00]  and freaking out, right?  Yeah.  It was like the moment of the Paul Simon show.  And the song finally ends.  And I'm not lying.  It was about a 15-minute song.  And all of a sudden, he just looks at the crowd and goes, what the hell?  Let's do it again.  Are you kidding?  He does the entire fucking thing again.  Mike, he doesn't have enough songs to do.  So he probably spent close to a half hour on one song, You Could Call Me Al. 
[00:50:30]  That would piss me off.  But at the time, it was outrageous.  Oh my God, how dare you do that?  That's unbelievable.  What?  That would really piss me off.  Because, you know, he's got all those classics from Simon and Garfunkel that he's not playing  because he's got to play this twice.  But he thought he was being, you know, ultra cool by going, what the hell, let's do it again.  And this is to play like Kodachrome?  Yeah.  Play a little Kodachrome.  Play a little I'm a rock, I am an island. 
[00:51:00]  50 ways?  50 ways to leave your lover.  How about Steve Gag?  Right.  Anyway, still crazy after all these years.  Anyway, we're going to go in a bunch of different directions here.  Imus talking about O&A and shirts once again on MSNBC.  Again today.  Yeah.  We love the I-man.  I guess at this point, Imus is now working for the same company as us.  That's the only thing I can figure out.  I think he knows something we don't.  I'm the new marketing director for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  He works for Infirmity Broadcasting.  He's on MSNBC.  He does his radio show on TV every morning.  And I don't even know how long this has been going on.  For over a month, the Brian Wilson character, which is Rob Bartlett.  Yeah.  He's been wearing my brother's Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirt.  Which you can get by going to opianthony.com.  And Imus is obsessed with us and the stupid shirts that we have out there.  He's a big fan.  You've got to appreciate that. 
[00:52:00]  I'm a true radio legend.  So, we just got some audio handed to us of Imus talking about the show and my brother's t-shirts again.  Here it is.  How's Opie and Anthony doing, by the way?  Let's see how you have their t-shirt on.  I don't know.  How are you, Opie?  O-N-A, Party Rock, XM-202.  Someone in my family stole my Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  And they're on XM Satellite Radio.  You can't get another Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  Well, you can. 
[00:52:30]  But you have to get a hold of Opie's brother.  It's a process.  And Opie's brother, what's his brother's name?  Do you know?  Elmo.  Elmo.  You have to get a hold of Opie's brother, Elmo.  What were their parents thinking about, by the way?  Opie and Elmo.  Anyway, you have to get a hold of Elmo.  That's your sister, Betty Bumperjack.  I knew the hell knows where Elmo is.  But Elmo, he eventually will send you the shirt.  Yeah, you just got to meet him with cash.  You have to pay for the shirt ahead of time. 
[00:53:00]  And then I guess what he does is he makes them once he gets the money.  How much are they?  About $19, $20, $20, $20, or more.  Well, it depends.  Double XL, get out that fat boy surcharge.  Anyway, $28 after the art.  Goddamn, Imus, thank you.  Thank you so much.  He's really helping.  Elmo, what the hell are their parents thinking?  He's really helping us out. 
[00:53:30]  He's promoting us on his show.  He doesn't give a fuck.  That's why we love the guy.  Yep.  He doesn't listen to Infinity Broadcasting.  Yeah.  He doesn't listen.  He does his own thing.  He's not a pussy.  The guy can take some fun, some ribbing, some fun, good-natured ribbing.  And he's right about my brother.  My brother's like, you know, he barely leaves his house, and he's like, you know, designing  shirts 24 hours a day.  That's his gig.  And then you do have, well, I think it's getting better, but you send him the money, and then  he goes to the printer and gets a few made. 
[00:54:00]  Like, my brother lives a really strange life.  You think I'm weird.  Oh, that was all real.  I thought he was a fake man.  Oh, for the most part, that is real, yes.  My brother is a strange dude.  I'm afraid to open my mouth now after blowing that bit the other day.  Oh, the people were commenting on that.  Oh, I got a lot of shit on there.  Hey, nice job, Dad.  Nice job.  By the way, my brother came up with a Halloween slash first anniversary T-shirt that will be  given away at the Hard Rock Cafe on Halloween night.  I like it.  The back is just full of words from the show. 
[00:54:30]  People, catchphrases.  Yeah.  I think it's really a fun shirt.  And if you go to the Halloween show that we're doing at the Hard Rock Cafe.  You can read the back of it and reminisce.  All right.  I think everyone that attends will get a free shirt.  Right when I said that, I was like, how could a shirt be fun?  Mad cap.  But if you want a shirt because you're not going to make it to the Hard Rock Cafe, you  can go to openanthony.com.  My brother needs some money.  That's why I'm promoting this right now.  Helping him out so he can pay some bills. 
[00:55:00]  But I'm just a big fan of the program.  Yeah.  All right.  Anthony, the assault on the media contest.  Yes, assault on the media.  We love when people do this.  Get behind a news camera.  Wait, now we got to back up a little bit.  Actually, in front of the news camera.  Behind would be silly.  I would never see you.  Paul on Long Island.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I think what I am, is he just fucking hates Howard's guts.  And that's part of the reason, too.  Well, you know, I've talked to Imus. 
[00:55:30]  I mean, I'm sure I love the show.  I mean, I love it.  I'm going to give you a little insight if you're going to, if you shut up.  Yeah, don't backpedal, man.  You started out strong.  Paul, you're very accurate.  All right, man.  Because I've talked to Imus, and Imus always respected the fact that we never backed down  to Howard, you know?  Yeah.  And he had his problems with Howard over the years, and he really likes that we stand up  to the guy, and we're not scared of him.  He respects that.  And also, hey, I have my Mossberg Model 500. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, you do?  Yeah, I'm in East North Port, so I'm going to come around me, and they're going to get  fucking fragged.  The armed citizenry of Long Island, welcome, my friend.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Rich in D.C.  Here's a Photoshop of me, Home Invasion, Shwoogieville, and it's got me in some living  room with a bunch of rappers outside the window for some reason, and I'm shooting a hole through  the glass.  Great job.  The Photoshop's are going crazy on whackbag.com. 
[00:56:30]  Can't you just see the innocent victim that's about ready to get shot?  Just like that guy's quote, like, oh, yeah, just wait for someone to come around me.  Oh, someone's going to come home late.  So you get fucking fragged.  Some drunk family member's going to come home late.  You know, he's put the key in the door and can't quite get the door open.  Someone's just going to unload around through the door and take out their father or something.  Yeah.  And there I am fighting Errol Flynn on a stairway.  We got the Al Pacino Scarface scene, too, which is really good. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Photoshop's are rolling in.  Go to whackbag.com.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rich in D.C.  What's up, Rich?  Hey, boys.  Thanks for taking my call.  All right.  Sure.  If Jimmy's listening, happy birthday, Jimmy.  What's calling about is on the front page of the Style section of the Washington Post  is a huge story about how Howard Stern is tanking in the D.C. area, that ever since he made  his big announcement a year ago, his ratings have continually plummeted, and it's gotten  so bad that right now the sports junkies and Don and Mike are beating the shit out of them 
[00:57:30]  in the ratings in D.C.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  This isn't even something that's subjective or, you know, you like him, you don't like  him.  This is just a fact.  I mean, this is ratings.  This is fact.  His ratings have been tanking.  And the fact is he's not as great as he tries to tell his audience on a daily basis.  A lot of cities have just stopped listening to him.  Does he still have a huge listenership?  Of course he does.  In New York, he does. 
[00:58:00]  But it's nowhere near what it was a few years back, and that's when I think he would have  been worth the $500 million that Sirius has decided to pay him.  That's when it would have been worth it, because that's when it would have gotten a huge amount  of subscribers to Sirius.  But I really think they kind of missed the train on this one.  Well, if anybody has any doubt, it's in black and white.  All they've got to do is check the front page of the Style section of today's Washington Post.  There's a picture of him and a two-page article on it. 
[00:58:30]  Well, I just got a communique from Elo.  Elo.  He just sent me that exact article.  Shock Jock's audience is beating him to the door July through September ratings, lowest  in years, Washington Post reports.  The Howard Stern exodus has begun.  Unfortunately for Stern, it's his audience that's leaving, not him.  The Shock Jock won't jump to satellite radio until January.  But in the meantime, his listeners in the Washington area seem to be heading for the exits.  Stern's nationally syndicated morning program, which is heard locally on WJFK, suffered a 
[00:59:00]  dramatic fall in the summer audience ratings, which in turn helped drag down WJFK's overall  popularity.  Stern's share of radio's most lucrative audience, adults age 25 to 54, fell by nearly one-third  during the July through September period.  Bottoming out at 3.4%, according to Arbitron, which measures radio audiences.  That was the lowest total for Stern in years and possibly decades, given his long and successful 
[00:59:30]  career.  During the same period in New York, Stern lost 15% of his listeners.  Yeah.  And it just keeps going on and on.  Yeah.  It goes on for like two pages.  That's some of the headlines right there.  No.  Yeah.  Okay, boys, I got to put that to go to work, but just so that I'd make it right.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  Okay.  Point counterpoint.  Don Imus.  Ray Romano.  Uh, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Mal.  Uh, yeah.  Mal.  Yeah.  Mal.  Um, yeah.  Mal.  Come on.  Yeah.  Mal.  Mal.  Uh, yeah.  Mal.  Next time on a very special Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray's brother needs a helping hand.  Ray, I got a problem, man. 
[01:00:30]  You got to help me.  No.  I picked up a tranny last night at Hunts Point, and there was an accident.  No.  We were trying this erotic asphyxiation thing, and he, she was supposed to pitch me before  it ran out of air.  What are you doing?  But Ray's father isn't buying it.  What a lot of bulls.  Come on.  All right.  You got me.  I picked him up on 10th Avenue.  The family hijinks don't stop there.  Ray, you got to help me get rid of the body.  I don't want to do it.  No, come on.  It'll be fun.  We'll chop it up and bury it out in Jersey.  I live on Long Island.  All in the next Everybody Loves Raymond. 
[01:01:00]  Tonight at 8.  Very good job, Steve.  Another Raymond, Daniel, and probably the rest of the gang helping out with the writing  of that fine promo featuring Bill Burr.  All right.  That's a good one.  The Assault on the Media contest, Anthony.  Yes.  Trying to get the show back on track here.  We're on track.  It's just a wavy mountain road.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  The Assault on the Media contest.  The contest for October is really, dare I say, heating up. 
[01:01:30]  Absolutely heating up.  We do this contest every month.  And every month we've got lots of great prizes.  This month we've got the portable Delphi MiFi radio with a one-year free subscription.  Also dinner with E-Rock at Paisano's and Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Also you win a World Poker Tour Season 2 DVD, Ministry of Sound Stick Axe Music Mixer,  and finally admission to the Opie and Anthony Show Studios to check out a live show.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  And you might remember John from New Jersey, Anthony. 
[01:02:00]  John from New Jersey.  Hmm.  John from New Jersey is the current leader.  His video is up on opiananthony.com, and it was a very, very good one.  He beat out No Filter Paul, which we thought...  Oh, of course.  We thought no one was going to beat out No Filter Paul, because he looked like a crazed man.  No, this guy's a maniac.  But then this guy John from Jersey hit WABC-TV here in New York, and basically his assault  was jumping up and down looking like a maniac as well, going from side to side, trying to 
[01:02:30]  pull out his hair on live TV.  Yeah, he wanted to look like he was pulling his hair out of his head.  Yeah, I like that one.  He comes off like a true lunatic.  Right.  He took Paul's cue or what have you, or what Paul did, and made it a little better, I think.  Every time the reporter moved in his way, he went to the other side.  He was like zigging and zagging to get on camera.  Right.  And he's actually trying to pull his hair out.  So the video's up on opiananthony.com, but here's the audio, which is pretty good, too. 
[01:03:00]  Mother Nature's trifecta of high tide, steady winds, blowing rains, etc.  Forced this, the lake, to spill over on both sides, and the result was evacuated.  Opian Anthony, it's in satellite radio!  Opian Anthony, it's in satellite radio!  Truly a pest of this program right there.  It's a good one.  Very, very good.  Very good.  That's why we call these people pests.  Pests.  They really are pests.  And we mentioned this the other day.  You've got to think they're having meetings now behind closed doors going, 
[01:03:30]  Look, guys, this is happening, it's Opian Anthony, and they're pests, and they're going to do it for a while,  and eventually it's going to go away.  So let's just ignore it, let's make believe it's not happening,  and just plow through your report, and eventually this will die down.  Most of them are pretty good at it.  And I say to those people saying that to their people, this will not die down.  No, no, it'll keep going.  Actually, we see a spike in the assaults on the media lately.  Yeah.  It's starting to spike up again.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  People coming to the table, getting in front of those cameras, and our latest one I really enjoyed. 
[01:04:00]  Well, we kind of made the suggestion earlier this week, I think,  that I think it's time to take it to the next level with this assault on the media contest.  Remember, we don't want you touching the reporter.  That's key to this.  Yep.  But it looks like a lot of reporters are starting to touch the pests, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  The pests are getting touched.  They're getting pushed.  They're getting dragged out of the camera range.  They're grabbed.  So the other day.  Molested.  No, no arrests yet.  Thank God.  No.  Molested. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, you said molested.  I'm sorry.  I thought you said arrest.  We're used to people getting arrested because of this program.  We're due for a good arrest, I think.  Billy Barr.  Bill, you want to take one for the team?  Yeah.  Everyone else has.  Even those black took one for the team.  So we were talking about the assault on the media contest.  We said it's time to take it to the next level, and we need to maybe engage the reporter in conversation.  Yeah.  Because they're ignoring us.  They're ignoring us.  We're jumping up and down and looking like lunatics, and they're just plowing through the reports for the most part. 
[01:05:00]  Every once in a while, you get a producer pulling them out of the shot.  Or you get someone like Arthur Chien, who is stupid enough to actually turn around and say, what the fuck is your problem, man?  But in general, they're ignoring and plowing through their reports.  So we said, hey, start engaging the reporter in a little conversation.  And someone took our advice.  We don't even know who this guy is yet.  Yeah.  We don't even know who this guy is, but the video is up on opianthony.com.  And we've watched the video a few times, and I think this guy, if he comes forward, is the new leader for the assault on the media contest for October. 
[01:05:30]  Could be the new leader.  The video is just priceless, obviously.  He gets mushed.  But listen to the audio.  Oh, yeah.  You want to explain the video?  They mush him.  Well, he blurts out opianthony, XM Satellite Radio.  But he just kind of saunters into the frame.  Kind of gets right in there over the shoulder of the reporter and starts saying opianthony, XM Satellite Radio.  The reporter kind of sees him coming, and you can see him look out of the corner of his eye. 
[01:06:00]  And then he's in frame with him, saying opianthony, XM Satellite Radio.  And then the reporter takes his hand and pushes this guy's face.  He just pushes his face right out of the frame.  It's a classic mush.  And, yeah, you said he was saying opianthony, XM Satellite Radio, but he was actually asking the reporter.  Yeah.  You know, do you listen to opianthony on XM Satellite Radio?  Yeah, he was engaging him in conversation.  Bill, here it is.  The video's up on opianthony.com. 
[01:06:30]  Just Perth and boy.  Watch Bill Burr's, listen to Bill Burr's reaction here.  Here's the reporter.  He's looking to the side.  Now he knows someone's there.  He's looking again.  And this guy's asking him if he listens to opianthony.  And now he just pushes him.  By the way, this happened on WABC Channel 7 again.  Yeah.  So ABC 7 is getting hit a lot lately as far as this assault on the media thing goes.  I don't know why that is.  Let's listen to the audio. 
[01:07:00]  The search dogs actually missed the 10-year-old boy the first time they went by that house.  Don't know if that matters now.  He's a little dehydrated with a few cuts and bruises, but he'll be okay.  We're live in Perth and boy tonight with some company.  Jeff Begay, Channel 7, Eyewitness News.  Everybody's celebrating out there.  Jeffrey, thank you.  Everybody's celebrating out there.  Yeah, just another drunk.  Yeah, make believe an opianthony pest didn't get to one of your reporters.  Yeah.  You've got to see the video, though.  I like how he just peeks around the corner like he's just looking out his window or something. 
[01:07:30]  Hey, how you doing over there?  Yeah, a little Kermit the Frog moment.  Yeah.  Now you've got the guy that's pulling his hair out screaming and yelling opianthony.com,  satellite radio.  But this guy, very subtle.  Definitely, you've got to give him points on a new style.  I like the new style.  New style.  What do you think?  I like it.  It's very close.  I've got to tell you.  Very close.  Sort of pest chic.  Yeah.  So we'll have to sit on this and decide if he's the new leader or not.  Yeah, I'm not willing to appoint him the winner right now because the last guy, action-packed, 
[01:08:00]  it's two completely different deliveries.  You're going to have to act like there's going to be different genres of it.  Yeah.  Everything in fact is sort of a crazed action movie.  This is more of a...  Subtle.  It's an adult comedy.  A lot more story-driven.  Yeah.  But Bill makes a good point how he just peeks around and all of a sudden he's in the shot.  Just very casual.  Yeah, a lot of layers to this character.  He never loses his cool.  All right.  You want to get Brother Joe in here before we take a break?  Certainly.  Halloween party's happening.  Halloween night at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[01:08:30]  We were supposed to give out tickets this week.  We didn't.  Yeah.  So it's going to be first come, first serve, as they say, at the Hard Rock Cafe Halloween  night.  I guess door...  What about the out-of-town people?  The doors open at 7.  I don't know.  What about Steve's secret list?  Steve has a secret list?  Yeah, Steve apparently, steve at foundrymusic.com, if you email him, he'll put you on the secret  list so you can get into the Halloween party, Opie.  And he will put his big fat fist in my face when he hears me say that. 
[01:09:00]  Yes, he will.  Oh, he's going to get all these emails now, and I'm going to get one going, why are people  emailing me?  I have no idea.  I can't get them on any list.  That's almost as...  Here he comes.  Can you stop?  What's wrong, Steve?  Can you stop?  What's the matter?  Because people believe that when you say it.  Well, everyone knows you do have a secret list.  Isn't there a secret list?  There was.  Past tense.  Was.  Oh, so there was.  And then that limey gentleman opened his...  Yeah, no filter.  Paul screwed it up and posted it on the website saying, there's a secret list. 
[01:09:30]  Anyone who wants to get on it, governor.  I'm starting a secret list, by the way.  Are you?  Mail me $100.  Oh.  Ow.  Mail me $100, and I will make sure you get into the party.  Secret list.  That kind of list we can handle.  No, we were actually trying to accommodate some of the people that were coming from out  of town.  Yeah.  And, you know, and it was a case-by-case thing.  And every email that Ben and I sent out said, look, yes, you're in.  Have a good time.  If this hits a message board, do not bother coming. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  And it hit a message board, and we just said, that's it.  No more.  Almost got Paul banned from the party, too, I heard.  Oh, yeah.  We let him sweat for a couple days.  He was freaking out.  Did you hear about that, that Paul, no filter Paul, was told that he couldn't come to the  party because he had posted that, and he was banned from the party, him and his wife.  And I got an email within seconds.  Everybody got emails going, what the fuck is this?  Why ain't I allowed?  And we let him hang for a while.  Yeah, I let him dangle for a few days.  Let him dangle, thinking he was banned from the party. 
[01:10:30]  What's his costume going to be?  Hopefully English-lammy asshole.  Just wear regular street clothes.  Yeah, regular street clothes.  You know, I think we should ban him from the party until he, like, moons on live TV.  Ugh.  I see that.  It's not about actually wanting to see it.  It's that he did it.  It's about humiliation.  Thank you, Bill.  Someone gets it.  No, I want to see fucking no filter Paul's ass on live TV.  Of course not. 
[01:11:00]  Isolate that.  I'm kidding.  Just take out the no, and we have a great clip.  Yeah, great.  Thanks.  Thanks, John Corzine.  Opie wants to see a bare English ass on television.  So anyway, Steve has a secret list, so keep emailing Steve.  Yeah.  Steve at foundrymusic.com.  Secret list.  He's not busy enough, I don't think.  No, no.  You'll get it for the part.  Oh, of course, Steve.  That two hours that he sleeps, he doesn't need to sleep. 
[01:11:30]  He always has a secret list, though, isn't that true?  Always.  Always.  For everything.  All right.  Very secretive.  Brother Joe's playing our Halloween party.  Yeah.  At the Hard Rock Cafe, Times Square, Halloween night.  That's correct.  With 2U, the U2 tribute band that's just blowing up.  Yeah.  Playing all over the place.  It's fun.  We just played the Wachovia Center.  We did two shows in front of U2, believe it or not.  It was a, it's the, they call it a singular, yeah, it was really weird. 
[01:12:00]  They call it a singular pavilion.  It's like where you walk through to get into the arena.  And we played for about 50,000 of U2's fans.  So wait, wait.  The people are going in to see U2.  Yeah.  Well, they were going in to see Damian Marley.  But we played right up until the beginning of Damian Marley's set from like 5 o'clock  until about 7.30 and everyone that was coming into that concert got to go, you know, come 
[01:12:30]  past where we were playing and we had at any given time standing there in front of us  about 3,000 people that were actually just sitting there watching, watching us do songs  like The Unforgettable Fire and old, like glorious stuff they're not doing live.  Right.  And freaking the F out, man.  They were just, yeah, it was the best show I've ever done.  Best show we've ever played.  Wow.  Yeah, it was amazing.  A lot of things happened.  We're now at the Borgata because of that.  We ended up getting, I mean, hundreds, hundreds of emails. 
[01:13:00]  Let me know when you're playing the Borgata.  I mean, I have much too much spare money laying around.  I'm sure they need it.  Yeah, we'll be there.  Believe it or not, it was Ron Hudson's, remember the Hudson Brothers?  Yeah.  He's the guy over there and his main guy was in the audience when we were playing and  he walks up to me and hands a Borgata card off and I said, what's this?  He goes, I want you guys in my room.  I look, I see a Borgata hotel. 
[01:13:30]  Perhaps you can get some of your friends in show business to also come and play here.  Yeah, no doubt.  He's dressed like boss hog.  Speaking of friends, I do have Chris from Live Wire, the lead singer.  Yep.  And Anthony from 2112, the lead singer of 2112.  Yeah, because we've got a Rush tribute band and the ACDC tribute band and they are the  two as well.  The best at what they do.  Now, what is good about tribute bands is the really good ones and the really bad ones.  Yes.  The mediocre ones, give a shit, right? 
[01:14:00]  It's just the ones that you go, holy shit, they are spot on, amazing.  And then there's the ones that are like, oh my God, why are they trying?  And both of them, very entertaining.  The obscure tribute bands are the ones that rock too.  Yeah.  Did you actually find ones like the Ann Murray tribute band?  I found Ann Murray.  I found a Carpenter's tribute band.  The Carpenter's.  Who's, what type of crowd is a Carpenter's tribute band?  I mean, who's showing up there? 
[01:14:30]  Just the emaciated women, binging and purging in front of the stage.  And really depressed brothers with no career left.  Oh, oh.  Because the talented one is dead.  Oh, that's horrible.  And then one of the Carpenter's bands has a name.  Like, you'd think that the tribute bands would come up with names that are recognizable as  the band and kind of catchy.  And what was one?  The Carpenters with a K. 
[01:15:00]  Like carp, like a fish.  A carp.  The Carpenters.  Carpenters.  They come out with big, bulgy, orange eyes and play Carpenter's music.  And then there's another one.  What's the girl's name?  Her name was Laura.  Laura.  And she's so self-centered, she wanted her name to be incorporated in the title.  But it's Carpenters.  So how did she solve that problem?  L-A-U-R-P-E-N-T-R-S.  The Larpenters.  Larpenters.  Boy, that just rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it?  And they're both from the UK. 
[01:15:30]  Both bands are from the UK.  Well, we've got to listen to some of these things here.  Well, track two would be...  What do we got in here that you just handed me?  That's, that's, that's, this is the Carpenters thing.  This is?  Track two is, uh, is close to you by The Carpenters with a K.  Okay.  Let's listen to this.  If it cues, uh...  Alright.  Ah, who could forget the haunting melodies of The Carpenters?  The Carpenters.  She's actually not bad.  Really?  Yeah.  Why do birds suddenly appear? 
[01:16:00]  Does she sound like her?  Every time you are there, just like me, they long to be 73 pounds.  Why do stars fall down from the sky?  Now, she's not the good one.  No?  No.  Every time you walk by, just like me, they long to be, close to you. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  On the day the chief of all the angels get together, and the time to create it.  Wow.  Alright, that's pretty good.  If you're into that.  I don't know who they're attracting, like, who's sitting there.  I don't know, man.  In the UK, evidently, the Carpenters still have a pretty good following.  That's pretty impressive.  They work.  I mean, you know, they had a few...  What happened to the punks and mods? 
[01:17:00]  I don't know, man.  Geez, people listening to the Carpenters.  There's a...  The Who to that.  Yeah, the Who to that.  Now, the Larpinters  This is track four  We'll skip Rainy Days and Mondays by the Carpenters with a K  Go to the Larpinters  Which kind of rolls off the tongue, don't it?  Yeah  Track number four, Close to You  It's a different band, same song  Oh, more of an orchestral  Higher production value 
[01:17:30]  Here you go  On the day that you were born  The angels got together  And decided to create a dream come true  So there's no clue that's in your hair  Go to the side  And your eyes are blue  And that is why  I'm the crazy child  Follow you 
[01:18:00]  Idiot  Oh, pop over track five  This is We've Only Just Begun  It's actually probably the best one out of the Carpenters  We've Only Just Begun  Yeah, she's obviously got the sound down  Unfortunately, they won't be performing at our Halloween party  Because I would love to see our crowd in front of this  How long after they all make the butthead face of 
[01:18:30]  Would it just be  They'd be pelted  She could hand out the XM baseball  Yeah  Let them wind up  Yeah, why not?  How's Stalker Patty lip sync?  Like, so many roads to choose  All right  Well, it's so much for the Carpenters  Sounds great  Yeah, but it's still the Carpenters  Were they from, like, Utah?  Doesn't it sound like they had to be somewhere from the Midwest?  Yeah, definitely from the Midwest somewhere 
[01:19:00]  From a 35-year-old virgin  I want to hear some Tom Jones  Now, I hear you have a really bad Tom Jones  Yeah, there's a pretty bad one in here  Okay  Let's hear the good one first  No, no, no, listen  You've got to hear the bad one first  The bad one first?

I can't open the umbrella  Rob Bartlett's fucking hysterical  All right  So Brian Wilson character with the O.P. Anthony t-shirt on MSNBC  Just standing there with an umbrella  With the hurricane in the background 
[01:20:00]  When is it supposed to hit land or any land?  It's supposed to hit land sometime late Thursday and into Friday  And then Southwest Florida into Sunday and Monday  So it's certainly a strong storm  Here's the path  Here, move out of the way of the path  This way, over here  All right, there you go  There you go  You can see, uh, until Sunday morning  Expected to head into parts of the weather report  Thanks for the, uh, shaving  Put the umbrella over the weather guy's head  So we could even have a third landfall with this system  So you may have to travel  Not only to Cancun, but to Florida 
[01:20:30]  And then to New England  So we'll send you there with your umbrella  All right, Jeff  Like Mary Poppins, look  Jeff Rennaro, the embassy meteorologist  I hope that thing stays down to the south  Oh, I know  Dude, that could kill me  We're going to Florida  Yeah  I got  When do you leave?  I'm flying out on Sunday  Oh, on Sunday?  You got a problem  I'm leaving tomorrow  Yeah, I know  Oh, boy  I'm leaving Saturday  I got to get to Miami  I'm hoping that, uh  Yeah, he's leaving Miami on Saturday  I don't know  I might have a problem  This Hurricane Willem is fucking up our vacations 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I'm going to Albany, man  I'm really  You know  All right, let's get back on track here  So we got more tribute bands here  We have a bad Tom Jones tribute from the UK  I didn't even get the guy's name  But it's not unusual  Track 8  Track 8, okay  It's all the, uh, all the UK, huh?  They're huge over there  Yep  This one is, uh  A little slow  Slow and just sappy 
[01:21:30]  It's live  I bet he does with the, uh  He does his hip movements  And girls throw underwear at him  Ah, yeah  It's actually a guy called Ultra Jones  It's ultrajones.net  That's hysterical  Does he look like him?  Does he try to?  Not at all  He wears a wig  And he makes it like  He makes it obvious  He'll like  He'll let it ride back on his head  So he's got like  8 inches of forehead 
[01:22:00]  And then pull it down on purpose  On the video  It's hysterical  He's like a goof on Tom Jones  But, um  Yeah, that's Ultra Jones  This guy is not him  Now this next one  Just play it  Track 9  You tell me  Oh, okay  This guy's a little more professional  Yeah  That's pretty good 
[01:22:30]  It's like music to fuck women with big moths  Like old 70s  Yeah, dressed like Mrs. Roper  Right  In the moo-moo  This is sexy music to them 
[01:23:00]  The last  Not bad  That's really good  The last Tom Jones show that I saw  Well, you saw him recently  I went to go see Tom Jones in Atlantic City about a month or a month and a half ago  I saw him about three months ago in Atlantic City  And the women there  Mrs. Roper is actually an improvement  Yeah, they get some old ladies there that are just creaming over Tom Jones  And then you get some young, hot chicks that are like caught up in the moment  I guess their mothers brought them or something  And they were throwing their panties at them  And then one thing really disturbing was like on side stage kind of 
[01:23:30]  In front of the stage but way to the side  Was a girl that had to be probably six or seven  And she's dancing  Like their parents brought her  And she's dancing  And Tom Jones came over at one point and like handed her a flower  I thought you were going to say she threw her panties on stage  The hotel, yeah  Little underoos  The Wonder Woman underoos hits him in the face  There's pee in them  What else you got there, Brother Joe? 
[01:24:00]  All right, we have  Well, my ex-lead singer  Laird  Laird!  Good old Laird  All right, we have him doing the song One  See, Anthony once made a comment  And he's like capitalized on this  That Laird is probably one of the best singers  Not just in the tribute world but ever  I think Laird's voice is great  He's been pounding this into the ground  Yes, he has a spectacular voice  The problem is he sounds nothing like Bono 
[01:24:30]  Well, right  And he's doing this U2 thing  So, here's a little clip of Laird  Can you see there's a little friction here?  You know what?  The lyriction's over, man  Let me just give a little background  Joe's U2 tribute band  Right  Go ahead, Anthony  Joe, he was the singer in Joe's U2 tribute band  But not only that  Joe and Laird's history goes back for years  Probably 20 or so years  20 years  These guys have never been able to be in a band  For any length of time together  They were the Lennon and McCartney of 
[01:25:00]  He's an asshole  Right  How can you be in a band with an asshole?  You've got to work with these people  That's what goes on  Don't you need that tension?  No  No, you really don't  And he thinks Joe's an asshole  I was always  The whole time I was doing bands with him  I was envious of comics  Because, I mean, you could go and do your own  It's your own  It's you you have to deal with  90% of the time  You don't have to deal with anyone  But you guys were friends for a long time, right?  Knowing that the other guy was an asshole  Yeah  We knew that 
[01:25:30]  We were friends and stuff  90% of any band out there works like this  They don't really enjoy each other's company  It's just you're working together  If a band hits  Now you've got to stay in it for the cash  Exactly  But these two  I mean  And it would always end this way  Joe on the phone  Joe on the phone to me  Man  Yeah, what's up?  Fucking Laird, man  Fucking Laird  Never again  Never again  What happened?  The guy is a fucking dick 
[01:26:00]  And no, that's it  Joe, you know damn well  Somewhere down the road  You guys are going to be in a band together  No, no  Dude, I know I've said it before  But this time, no  Fuck him  Never again  This is actual audio  Fast forward maybe  Anywhere from six months to five years later  But anywhere between there  Hey, what's up?  Not too much  Yeah, you're going to come down to the gig  Me and Laird are playing down  Laird?  Oh, yeah  No, I can fucking dick 
[01:26:30]  But, you know  I needed a singer  But he's got a voice  Exactly  The guy can fucking sing  I can't sing  He can't play guitar  And then fast forward again  Man  That fucking asshole  Never the fuck again  Will I even get near the stage he is on  This went on for 20 years  Well, dude  I mean  I don't even want to get into the reason  But the guy's a bullshit artist  The guy's a bullshit  Let's say  He can embellish a story  Shoot the hostage  There was one  Alright, right after 9-11  Now, everyone knows somebody like this 
[01:27:00]  Everybody has somebody like this in their life  After 9-11  Laird came into the studio one day  And we were all hanging back in the office  Remember when we did afternoons  We'd all go back to the office  Drink a little  Hang out  A little  Yeah, I know  So Laird comes back  And we're hanging out  Having a good time  And Laird talks about how he signed up to be an air marshal  Because that was like the big thing that was going on then  Going to be an air marshal  Applied for the job  Oh, really?  But this is after years of hearing Laird's, you know, stories  So we look and go, really? 
[01:27:30]  But there are people there that don't know Jim  You know, we know Jim  So we're like, alright, here comes another one  Yeah, I signed up to be an air marshal  I went down and took the test  I was like, oh yeah, what's that all about?  Well, it's some written test  And then they give you, you know  They give you a test  I go, what happened?  He goes, well, there's certain scenarios  One was, you're in the aisle of an airplane  And there's a terrorist  And he grabs a hostage  And the instructor asks, okay, what do you do? 
[01:28:00]  And everyone had the wrong answer  So he picks at me and I go, you shoot the hostage  And he pointed at me and said, you're absolutely right  And I'm just sitting there like  Wasn't it obvious if everyone else got the answer wrong  They were all saying, shoot the terrorist  Or trying to negotiate  Or anything but shoot the hostage  Right  Wasn't that the last  It was  We go around  The last option  Jimmy, fucking Norton, to this day  We'll just bust out 
[01:28:30]  We'll be eating dinner  And out of nowhere, Jimmy will just go  Shoot the hostage  Still, years later, it's hysterical to us  He was managed by Tommy Mottola  He was managed by Roger Dalton  Yeah  He was going on tour with Hall & Oates  But he came down with a strep throat  I got the strep throat  Dude, the guy just bullshits way too much  It's always like a huge story  Anyway, I believe  In fact, I know  So he moved on and started another YouTube  Yeah, he did  He started a new tribute 
[01:29:00]  But I mean, for reasons I can't even get into  But it sounds like shit  It's not a good sounding U2 tribute  But  And trust me, Joe's not jealous  Because the new singer you got  He's unbelievable  Yeah, Tommy's great  It's  You guys are the premier U2 tribute band  Well, thank you, Ope  Laird sounds like fucking Cher  He sounds like Cher  Just a little bit  Like Cher  Track 12 is Laird singing the song One  Okay  Okay  Alright 
[01:29:30]  Now I A-B'd him on track 13  I A-B'd him with Cher 
[01:30:00]  So compare voices and tell me that he doesn't have Cher's singing style  Wow, they hate each other  Oh, I know  Dude, it's not a matter of hatred  It's not a matter of hatred  It's 20 years ago  Until they'll fuck themselves  That's right  I've just sat in my room and fucking spliced the audio together  There's no vengeance  Let's see if he can go to his brother's precinct and play tapes for his friends  Joe's traveling pretty much the world with the new U2 tribute band  But he can't let this go  He will not  He just played at the Wachovia Center in front of 3,000 people at any given time, right? 
[01:30:30]  Duck guy's a fucking asshole  Sounds like Cher  Fucking dick  Exactly  And he's in the same  He's being a tribute to the same band that you're doing  You fucking hate him  I can't wait for him  Just admit it and then we'll play this track  I'd like if he's a hack  You know you understand that language?  He's a hack  Alright, let's  He's like the Joe Rogan of the tribute band things  He's calling them out  He's calling everyone out  He's not even Mexican  He's fucking half German  I'm ready to jump in the fucking octagon now, man 
[01:31:00]  They call me the Punisher  Shoot the hostage  Alright, so you spliced it together here, Joe?  Yeah, track 13  It's just a little, uh  And you had time to do this with all the  They calling out all hacks  I was up until about 1.30 in the morning doing all this  All hacks  All hacks must die  Right  Zero tolerance  Did he hear he was up until 1.30 in the morning?  1.30 in the morning  That's anger  Not too obsessed with this whole thing  I was compiling everything  He probably had a headshot of the guy above his computer  Here you go, you fuck  I was born in the wagon of a traveling show 
[01:31:30]  My mama used to dance for the money they'd throw  Mama would do whatever he could  Okay, that was Cher  And he's gonna give us forgiveness  There you go  Sounds like fucking Cher  You are just really angry, Joe  Listen  Listen to head 
[01:32:00]  Wait, listen  What a pissed off individual  I gotta say, you're reaching a bit  Yeah, I'm not really hearing it  I wasn't really 
[01:32:30]  I'm not really hearing it as strongly as you are  It's the vibrato in his voice  I'm not the same  Well, when we heard each other  Then we'd do it again  Then he was 21  I don't hear it  Shoot the hostage  By the way, that was from a movie, wasn't it?  Shoot the hostage thing?  It was from Speed  Alright  One of those  No, you don't  Shoot the hostage  Well, alright 
[01:33:00]  Shoot the hostage  We can move on up  There's a Steely Dan tribute out of New York called Steelin' Dan  Steelin' Dan  Steelin' Dan  It's track 14  Alright  And the song is Peg  This is a live recording, by the way  Give them a little  That's a Steely Dan  Sounds like Cher, though 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, that's pretty good  Very good  Yeah, that's pretty good  Now, another live track  This is a Boston tribute called Smokin' out of LA  Boston, very difficult  The guy's range is ridiculous 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, Bradley Delp  Bradley Delp  You know Bradley Delp  I sang with Bradley Delp once up in Boston  You sure did, Anthony  Yes, I did  Yes, I did  Thank you  You got the strep throat, right?  Right, I had the strep throat  I was supposed to actually be the singer from Boston  You were supposed to go on tour with Boston  I got the strep throat  And then somebody actually on a plane grabbed a gun and put it to Bradley Delp's head  And I pulled out my gun and I shot Bradley Delp  Which is why that third album was delayed for so long  Right, but it's what you do  Wait, you know, the phones  My training kicked in 
[01:34:30]  The phones are all over Joe  Let's go to Mike in California  Mike  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, good  Hey, I just wanted to support Brother Joe there  I can hear the share and the guy he hates  I can hear the resemblance  Thank you, sir  All right  Thank you  Let's say hi to Steve in Maryland  Steve?  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  I heard that, Bill, brother  I was just wondering  Brother Joe  What did you say?  What did you say?  Oh, man  It was a great  It was a great line, too  He said  Stayed up until 1.30  When did he start? 
[01:35:00]  1.25  Oh  And then Mike from Whackback  Brother Joe is a quivering, angry ass  Rob in New York  Yeah, brother Joe's right on  He certainly sounds like Shaft  Where's he coming to New York, Joe?  Wow, he's playing the Halloween party for us  Yep  October 31st  October 31st  Hard Rock  Hard Rock Cafe  I don't think we're going to get Brother Joe's YouTube tribute band again after this  Oh, shit  You're just blowing up way too much  We're not going to be able to afford him, Anthony 
[01:35:30]  Joe in Jersey  What's up, fellas?  Joe, the guy isn't saying the lyrics right  He's saying lepers in your bed  He's not even saying the lyrics right  Oh, he still reads off the cue cards, too  That's embarrassing  That is, it's horrible  That's why I got rid of him  Fucking singers  That's right  You know, Bono reads off cue cards  That's the only reason I do it  So we're doing the Boston thing?  Yeah, I want to hear Bradley Delp  You know what?  You might want to, if you can fast forward into the track  Toward the end of this  Uh-oh  Of track number 15 is the better stuff 
[01:36:00]  That's hard  It's a medley, but it takes like a three  You know, it's like a three-minute medley  Whenever Opie's got to fast forward  So how far do you want me to go?  Um, about halfway through it  Track 15  Let's try this  Yeah  Wow  Listen  And this is live 
[01:36:30]  It's live, totally live  It's unbelievable  You go a little bit further forward 
[01:37:00]  The last song is just amazing  That is really amazing  The range on that guy's voice  Holy shit  How do people sing that high?  You want to kick him in a fucking ball  There you go  Listen to this  Listen to this  Yeah  Yeah  Ha ha 
[01:37:30]  The guy can sing  Like Cher 
[01:38:00]  That's smoke  Yeah, right  That's smoking  It's a little off, though, right?  Nah  That music makes me want to kill myself  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's that classic rock  Well, this will really hurt you then  Hold on, hold on  Bingo Pants from Wack Bag  Bingo Pants  Brother Joe  I just want to let you know  I heard Laird on another radio show  He's calling himself the Punisher  The Punisher  There you go  Joe  The B3s  They're from Australia  And it's a Bee Gees tribute 
[01:38:30]  Bee Gees?  Yes  And they're quite excellent  I mean, for the Bee Gees  If you can, you know  I mean  That's okay  I understand some relax  Bill Burr is just like  I hate this fucking music  What do you listen to, Bill?  What type of music do you like?  Well, not that shit  Richard Pryor  What music do you listen to?  I don't know  I don't know  You don't know?  No  When you hear it, you know you like it?  Yeah, I mean  Yeah, at 37  I don't have like a favorite band  With like a fucking poster  In my bedroom  You know what I mean? 
[01:39:00]  I've been asking if you had posters  You can still have a favorite band at 37  But the poster thing went away  A long time ago  That dude, any shit  Comics are too self-centered  To notice anything else  No, that's not true  Yeah  No!  Come on!  Yeah, yeah  That dude, Common has a song that I like  Yeah?  On the corner  I don't know  I mean, I don't know  I just  Comics are just too busy 
[01:39:30]  No, you know what it is?  You guys are always  This is my thing  I'm totally into fucking music  But the second you ask me  What are you listening to?  I can't remember  I don't know  I like Primus for a long time  I'm into drummers, man  I'm frustrated  So I like Tim Alexander  You like Rush?  No  Oh, you better say yes  You better say yes  No, I just never got into them  Yeah  Dude, what the fuck?  I mean, somebody has to not like them  I mean, they still fill Giant Stadium, right?  Of course  It's like Bruce Springsteen  I never got into that guy  And fucking 80,000 people show up to see him 
[01:40:00]  How many Bruce tribute bands are there?  Probably a lot, right?  A lot  I actually did some research on the bands that we have playing on Halloween  There are  ACDC tops it out with 63 tributes registered on TributeCity.com  Most tribute bands are ACDC tribute bands?  Yep, 63  Then you have 58 U2 tribute bands worldwide  And I think it was something like 32 Rush tribute bands  Wow  What do we got next here?  Okay, we have the B3s  It's track 16 
[01:40:30]  These guys are from Australia  And they do the job well  Oh, no  Another live tape  Wow  Who sees this though?  Go and go and watch this  You know what this reminds me of?  After I did some horrible casino gig 
[01:41:00]  And I'm walking around with no chick  And I just go into the lounge next door  And this band is fucking playing  I'm just like  I thought this was going to be so glamorous  When I started telling jokes  It just makes me want to kill myself  You know what it feels like to be that lounge band?  Oh, yeah  They're pretty good, they're horrible  If you're into the Bee Gees, they know it  They know  This one is probably the best that I found out of this whole batch 
[01:41:30]  Track 17  A band called Oliver's Army  It's an Elvis Costello tribute  Elvis Costello  Yeah, but this guy is probably even better than the good Tom Jones  Better than the good Tom Jones  That's actually how he sells himself  I'm better than the good Tom Jones  It's on his website  I want to see like tributes  Sorry, go ahead  Tributes to like comedians  Yeah, why can't you  There are

You really are  No, you're supposed to use it for  He's studying these guys  We were talking about this  The first Sinatra wasn't that bad  No, but this guy  This guy actually  His voice is probably a little closer  Yeah  What track?  The problem was  He didn't say Lady's a tramp at all  He just kept saying  This chick is a tramp  This chick is a tramp  Red Fox died in 1991  Oh, he did? 
[01:49:30]  Bucky, you bet  She gets hungry  For dinner at eight  All right, this guy sucks  Yeah  She likes the theater  But don't come late  She'd never bother 
[01:50:00]  With anyone she'd hate  That's why  This chick, she's a tramp  This tramp  Tramp  Yeah  Yeah, I didn't get that either  She don't like us from the U.S.  With parents and us  That's why the bird is a tramp  Won't go to Holland  This bird  Dressed in ermine and parks  That guy's a wanker  All right  He's on the dole  Yeah, limey cunt 
[01:50:30]  We got a sample of Livewire  In 2112  I'd love to  Yeah, I'd like to do that  Which track?  Chris, off the CD  The one I gave you?  You know, one  That you burned?  Any of the scare shit?  Actually, it's probably  A bad place to be  We do have the A-Ha tribute band  As we try to  Oh, yeah  Let's try the A-Ha  Yeah, we started this conversation  With the A-Ha tribute band  Nice 
[01:51:00]  Yeah  Oh, see, he likes Stacey Ducey at least  Off of Powerage  Second side  Take me home  I love it  I love it  Take me home  Take me home  Uh-oh  I'll be gone  To be a team  I think that's a little falsetto  That's great, but it's one song 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, one song  Yeah, and done  Look at a dress like a pirate  Got a little ruffle stuff in front of your shirt  It's a five-minute show  Isn't that Adam Ant?  Adam Ant  Oh, is he the one dressed like that?  Yeah, he's got a tribute too, yeah  He's got a tribute  Adam Ant has a couple of tributes on Tribute City  Oh, sure he does  Yeah  Hysterical  Which one are we playing?  Goody Goody Two Shoes  And the one that says Live Wire on it  Live Wire?  We're trying to  We ran out of the studio to try to find it  Got Anthony with the 2112 stuff 
[01:52:00]  I saw one tribute band  I saw Physical Graffiti years ago  Are they still around?  Yes  Yes  They're around  They work a lot, too  Now there's Bono right there  Yeah  Looks a lot more like Bono than Laird ever did  Are they?  Laird looked like he ate Bono  He looks like Laird, you're saying?  No, no  But there's no animosity  None  None whatsoever  None  I've seen it for years  I always forget your name  Because I always just want to say  Hey, Bono  Because he looks just like him  Tom  It's Bono 
[01:52:30]  I saw these guys at BB Kings  We talked about on the radio  It was unbelievable  After the U2 show  I figured I'd just go in  And support Brother Joe  And the U2 Tribute Band  And I ended up staying for the entire set  I was so into it  What would you rather  What would you want to play, Ant?  What track?  This is Anthony from 2112  Another band that will be playing at the Halloween party  At the Hard Rock Cafe  Yes  We want the hits  We need a hit  This is radio  We only play the hits 
[01:53:00]  Tom Sawyer  We could do Spirit of Radio  Alright, what track is that?  That's a hit  Us is on 9  Rush is on 10  So if you want to compare  Oh, wow  He A-B'd it  Wow  He stayed up until 1.30 in the morning too  Wow  Wow, he's feeling confident  So, which one is you?  9?  9  Alright, so let's start with the Spirit of Radio by Rush  Which is 10, right?  This is Live Rush?  Live Rush  Okay  Bang 
[01:53:30]  Bang  Oh, yeah  That's scary. 
[01:54:00]  That's pretty good.  All right, that's Rush. 
[01:54:30]  That's Rush.  That's really Rush.  Really Rush.  And now this is 2112 doing the same song.  Did he do it?  Oh, that was really Rush.  That was really Rush Live.  I thought it was a tribute band.  No, that's why I was laughing at you.  I thought he was pulling the old, no wait, that was us.  That would have been cool to do.  That would have been great to do.  Too many people would know.  The old switcheroo.  So, okay, that was really Rush.  Now this is 2112, and these guys will be at the Halloween party. 
[01:55:00]  Yep.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No! 
[01:55:30]  No!  No!  Yeah.  Pretty good.  He's got a good voice. 
[01:56:00]  That sounds like Getty.  That's amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  Sounds like Getty.  Obviously, Rush able to get a better live recording.  Do you have any studio stuff on there, Ed?  Their equipment. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, I have some studio stuff on there.  A little better.  Yeah, one of the studio tracks.  That's only a 35-second.  That's 7 and 8.  We're on 7.  All right, we're on 7.  Okay, this is 21-12.  Come on.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Thank you.  That's you? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, I wanted to hear the chorus on that.  I know, the track ends right there.  That's you singing that?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  How does that happen, man?  You just sing it one day and somebody says, you know who you sound like?  And then you just go down that road.  Yeah, that's about it. 
[01:57:30]  Really?  Yeah, man.  Keep doing it.  That's really amazing.  Thanks a lot.  Wow.  All right.  Well, these guys will be at the Halloween party, 2012, along with Brother Joe's U2 tribute band  and, of course, Live Wire.  We want to play some Live Wire, too?  Yeah, I think he's going to grab Sin City off of our BB King's recording.  All right, let's hear this.  Thank you for a little fucking Sin City.  Oops.  Uh-oh.  Oh, you can't say fuck on the radio?  No, no, no.  What happened, Hawk?  Of course you can say fuck.  I don't know what happened over there.  What happened there, Hawk?  Well, you guys gave us a DVD, so we're trying to figure out how to play it on the radio here. 
[01:58:00]  It's in the PlayStation.  It's frozen.  I'm old school.  The only thing I have is cassette, and I gave it to Brother Joe last night.  Cassette.  Remember that?  Remember those?  I got, like, 20 dads.  I didn't know which one was the right one.  I didn't want to give you some of his band.  I got it on Laserdisc.  All right, we'll try to figure it out.  The PlayStation, by the way, sucks for playing DVDs.  I hate that.  In the meantime, you might want to try some 2U.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Track 10.  Track 10.  Track 10.  So who's the drummer supposed to be? 
[01:58:30]  Is it Phil Rudd, Chris Slade, or Simon Wright?  He's Phil Rudd.  My buddy Bill there.  He's Phil Rudd.  Oh, Phil Rudd.  Okay, good.  Bill, a real ACDC fan.  We're a big Bon Scott band, but we'd have to do a lot of Brian, obviously.  Right, right, right.  But all of us in our hearts are loving Bon Scott a lot more.  All right, here's to finish this segment up about tribute bands.  Right up to flick of the switch.  I like them.  If we get the live wire thing working, we'll play a sample of that episode.  After the break, but here's Brother Joe's U2 tribute band playing the Halloween party 
[01:59:00]  at the Hard Rock Cafe Halloween night.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, there's quiet on New Year's Day Oh, well, there's quiet on New Year's Day

That's that fast one, yeah  It's called The Flight of the Bumblebee  Imagine The Flight of Ben's Hog  It's just clang, clang, clang, clang  Lumbering  Boom, boom  Phantom of the Opera would have to play it  Heavy, awful organ  Ben's Hog music  No, Ben's Hog music  Every time a zipper comes down, it goes 
[02:01:30]  Bum, bum, bum, bum  And he doesn't have to take it out  Ben just unzips it  And the head wriggles itself out and looks around  I'm no kin to a rhinoceros  My god, it's Newell Brenner  What are you doing, huh?  Yeah, here's Ben's Hog music  What's it called?  Baby Elephant Walk  Baby Elephant Walk  I gotta use this urinal

[02:02:30]  Picks up the urinal cake  And tries to eat it  He doesn't know  He's on the phone  He's trying to put the urinal cake in his mouth  He's trying to keep talking  He's trying to keep talking  He's trying to keep talking  Yeah, psycho cameras on  Ah, Tom Brady  Alright  Anyway  Where is he?  I love looking at him  Get all upset  He just shakes his head  He just shakes his head  I can see his head 
[02:03:00]  You're only in my way  You're wrong if you think  That I'll be just like him  Like him  Like him  You push it with it  And guide me  You're only in my way  You're wrong if you think  That I'll be just like him  Let's say hi to Mike  What's up Mike?  Hey guys, what's going on?  Ah, we're hanging out  We're hanging out  Hey, I'm actually a studio guitarist  And I'm amazed 
[02:03:30]  Like I know Bono's always the focus of every tribute band  But Joe, man, you are incredible  I mean, you know how tough that really is  Thanks a lot, dude  Yeah, it takes a little time to tweak, you know  Yeah, I mean, how many pedals do you run with?  One  It's a Korg AX1500G  It does everything  It's a wellness  I love the fact  Yeah, cool  All right, man, good luck at the show  Thanks a lot, brother  I was going to guess that  I know, yeah  Five people out there just went, oh  Oh, okay 
[02:04:00]  I'm just looking  I'm just waiting  All I want is Korg to be listening  That's all  Korg, Korg, Korg  I just want Korg to be listening  Get that endorsement deal  I need eight more of them, please  Eight more what?  Eight more Korg AX1500Gs  Thank you  Why, are they good?  Korg is great  They do the job  They do it excellent  They do an excellent job  Maybe somebody  When Brother Joe wants to become U2  He reaches for Korg AX1500G  All right, we got the guy on the line that did the assault on the media last night  So we're going to try to move on here 
[02:04:30]  But first, we're going to try the Live Wire thing  Yeah, see if this works  All right, Live Wire, another band playing the Halloween party, Halloween night at the Hard Rock Cafe  Here's a sample  On beta  Live from BB Kings  We are at the Times  And that's what's joining this year  Here we go  And that's what's going on  Very nice  Going away  And you're sort of never in the air  With this  Navy 
[02:05:00]  I'm out. 
[02:05:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:06:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:06:30]  What are you doing when you can't get the lyrics?  With the casual fans, that's all.  What does he say there in the middle of that?  Ladders.  And snakes.  What does he say, ladders?  Yeah.  Ladders Guild.  What are ladders?  Like what you climb up and never make any fucking sense?  Don't ask me.  The guy's dead.  I have no idea.  Yeah, you can't ask me.  You just mumble it.  Ladders.  And snakes.  That's pretty good.  He's pretty good.  Ladders Guild.  You want a gig?  Huh?  You want a gig?  I bought Scott and Jerry Lewis in the exact same way.  Hey, ladies. 
[02:07:00]  Ladders.  I was asking for a hit, so we had a whole lot of Rosie up there.  Yeah.  Thunderstruck.  We had Shoot to Thrill.  Hell's Bells.  And what was the other one over there?  Highway to Hell.  Highway to Hell.  And he picked Sin City.  No, Bill Burr won at Sin City.  Holy shit.  Thanks, Bill.  You don't know music.  Oh, Bill.  During the term, you don't know music.  That's for the real ACDC fans.  I'm trying to help Live Wire out over here.  You know, if you worked at the home of rock and roll five times, you would have known music.  That's right.  I've worked at three homes of rock and roll.  I know my music.  I'm trying to help the band out. 
[02:07:30]  Playing a hit.  That's why every time we got an ACDC coming up, they always play.  But I understand that.  That one shook me all night long.  If I ever hit, that's like the fucking.  I'm doing that four times at the Hard Rock.  Of fucking ACDC.  But I think there's a lot of people with me out there.  They're ACDC hacks, and they don't deserve to go to the show.  All right?  If you don't know what fucking Sin City is, stay home.  They want to hear a hit from Live Wire just so they can compare it to the actual ACDC.  Right.  That's what I'm thinking.  Am I stupid for thinking that? 
[02:08:00]  Nope.  Which one do you want to hear, Anthony?  Now you.  Hit.  Thunderstruck.  I want to hear Highway to Hell.  Highway to Hell.  There you go.  That's hilarious.  I was like totally getting into it.  Like, yeah.  Outridge, second side for a song.  You were drumming, and you were hitting every single drum.  I just want to.  Every accent.  I want to just drive the point home that Live Wire sounds a lot like ACDC.  Right.  And I think this is the way we do it right here.  Ready to play that, Eric?  You're actually right.  And I apologize, Eric.  I didn't know it was a Bill Burr request. 
[02:08:30]  We've got to go into your iPod.  I want to see what you're listening to.  Okay.  You got it here?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do that a little later on the show.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Actually, yeah, Chris.  That could get embarrassing.  Chris is now playing cross country as, you know, doing the ACDC thing.  Yeah.  He's all over the place, man.  You're like bi-coastal now.  You're playing out in...  I just want my guys out there from Live Wire to realize that I didn't bring that up.  You did, Joe.  Oh, boy.  It's a point of contention that I'm in two ACDC bands now.  Yeah.  Oh, you are?  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  Well, no.  They don't...  Oh, boy.  They don't intermingle.  One's, you know, a lot of ghosts.  That would be a problem.  There we go.  It's like having two girlfriends.  You keep them like a 50-mile rule.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  We all can relate to that.  Anything, uh-huh?  There you go.  All right.  Here we go.  This will drive the point home, Bill. 
[02:09:30]  The best part here, man.  The audience starts singing the whole song.  Yes, you're nothing.  We're not going to be on the side.  Show me the reason.  Don't you have it?  Ain't nothing that I love you.  Show us all.  Party time. 
[02:10:00]  My friends are going to be the tune.  Hey, I'm going to be the tune.  Yeah.  Look at those people.  It was crazy that night.  I got through so good watching it again.  Gee.  And the DVD is freaking out there.  Of course.  Hawk, you want to rode that?  You've got to remember, it's a 70s band, so DVDs don't go. 
[02:10:30]  Hey, is that it?  There you go.  DVD doesn't pick up the music of a 70s band.  Very good.  Live Wire, of course.  Yeah.  Outstanding.  ACDCTributeBand.com.  And for anybody up in Vermont this weekend, we are at Cousins in Barr or Barrie, however  you guys want to say it.  Audio Slave, I like.  Now I'm starting to remember my iPod.  Thanks for stepping on my ship, Bill.  You better.  He's fighting back now.  I love it.  If there's any Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. on there, you're in trouble, my friend. 
[02:11:00]  I did spray my neck earlier when you made a Fine Young Cannibals reference.  You were talking about current music and you said Fine Young Cannibals.  No, no, no.  We let you slide on that one.  I was saying that having Elvis come to the White House in 1972 to get the kids off of  drugs like they still look up to him was like Bush now getting the least...  Fine Young Cannibals to be hip.  And I made you explain it and it does work and I'm sorry.  All right.  Live Wire.  You know what?  Thank you.  It's a foul time.  I've been here all day.  I haven't heard it once. 
[02:11:30]  And you were right about Sin City.  I was being an ACDC snob and I apologize.  And we love snobs like you, Bill Burr.  MySpace.  All right.  We also have a...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Anthony, you want to plug your website, man?  Yeah, let's get the plugs in.  It's Rush Tribute Band 2112.com.  Very good.  All right.  And Brother Joe.  And Joe, of course.  Of course, not you too.  Dot com.  Nice.  This weekend we will be in Hoboken at the Whiskey Bar on Saturday night.  And on Friday night, we're in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania at Sheamsa, which is an Irish pub. 
[02:12:00]  Hi, an Irish pub.  Don't you know.  Work spreads around those Irish pubs and they're always close.  I get calls from 50 Declans a week.  Hello, it's Declan.  Which one?  And they're always fucking up.  And we'll see you guys.  Gentlemen, thank you.  Very good, guys.  Thanks for having us on.  Absolutely.  It's always fun.  2112.  Thank you for being so tolerant, Bill.  And to you.  I appreciate it, man.  Thank you for being a snob.  See you on Halloween. 
[02:12:30]  Snob.  At the big bash.  At the big swerine.  Yeah.  Looking forward to it.  Oh, yeah.  Here's some gifts that you can't smash, Opie.  I'm sorry.  A t-shirt.  I know it's a gay t-shirt and all, but...  Uh-oh.  Let me say.  And Anthony can wax the Escalade.  I'll wax the Escalade with it.  With the LiveWire t-shirt.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  That's good.  Thanks, guys.  It's got a chammy-like quality.  It's 100% cotton.  It won't leave any swirls.  I feel like a cheap bastard.  I've never brought anything into these guys.  I got a cassette and I got t-shirts, and that's all I got. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  We got to say hi to the guy that did the assault on the media on Channel 7 last night.  Thanks, man.  There they go.  Oh, this is the guy that did the assault?  Yeah, Wheel in New Jersey.  Wheel.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  What's up, Wheel?  Wheel?  How much, man?  Wheel.  You really, really impressed us last night.  Yeah, I don't know how this is going to turn out, though, guys.  They were mighty mad.  They were mighty mad.  Hold on.  Brother Joe is now whispering to Anthony as we try to do a live show. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, just shaking hands to go.  Shaking hands.  We know you love us.  Don't worry about it.  You don't have to do the official.  All right.  Here we go.  There you go.  A little fist for Joe.  Okay.  I'll call you later, man.  Thanks, Brother Joe.  Yep.  Now, what didn't work out well for you, sir?  Well, I haven't had the opportunity to see the tape yet.  He was saying after I did it, he got all mad and stuff.  And I was just kind of hanging out in Channel 2.  It was right down the street, getting ready to do another one.  So I was like, all right, I'll hit that other one.  And then the woman starts screaming bloody murder from Channel 2, saying, you better stay 
[02:14:00]  the hell away from me, and blah, blah, blah.  And all of a sudden, I turned around, and the cops are standing there.  Yeah, this thing has really taken on a life of its own.  It really is an assault on the media.  They're on to us big time.  When they were talking to the reporter from 7, was talking to the newsroom, and he goes,  where are you from?  I said, what do you mean, where am I from?  He goes, I'll be there for me, right?  I'm like, yeah.  He goes, and he was talking to producers.  They knew all about it.  Oh, really?  They knew it was coming. 
[02:14:30]  He said, oh, I'm going to get the lawyers involved, and you assaulted me.  I haven't seen the tape.  I didn't touch him.  I know I didn't touch him.  Assaulted.  Well, they're not going to do anything, or they would have done something already.  Don't you worry.  Oh, exactly.  Exactly.  I'm not.  Hello.  They're just trying to scare you so other people don't do this, but as long as you don't  touch the reporters and assault the reporter, you're okay.  He assaulted you, my friend.  He pushed you right out of the camera.  That's what I said to the nice officers.  I've got to give a shout-out to my buddies up where I was. 
[02:15:00]  I'm not going to go into it, but they helped me.  They helped me out up there.  All right.  Well, your video is up on opianthony.com, but walk us through the one you did for Channel  7 there.  I was standing right across the street at the hospital, and I'm looking, and my buddy  called me.  He was like, they're live, but they always go to that tape, and I didn't want to blow  it on the first one.  Oh, taking your advice, Anthony.  Yes.  Absolutely.  You've got to wait for the second one, because they've got nowhere to go.  Right.  So I walked up, and I'm about four foot away, and I saw him stop talking, so I just turned  around and walked away. 
[02:15:30]  I'm having a cigarette, and all of a sudden I looked, and he picked up the microphone,  and I walked right over and just walked right up next to him.  I was like, hey, how you doing?  You listening to the next time?  And he just looked at me, and he put his arm on my chest, and he kept talking.  You know what?  I'll give him credit.  He did.  I was right in his face, as you could tell, and he kept talking, and as soon as it ended,  he turned around, he's like, what the fuck's wrong with you?  I was hoping the camera was still on, but he was really fucking pissed.  It was great.  We've got to have these guys somehow have another friend filming it, like somebody said 
[02:16:00]  the other day, so you can start getting these.  I would love to see the other angle.  I was going to bring a video camera with me and videotape me doing him, but I didn't  think it was going to work out too well.  Man, if the guy that did the attack held a camcorder, that would be great, the pest-eye  view.  Yeah, Buffalo Paul has done that in the past.  It works out pretty well.  Yeah, I thought that would be pretty cool, but no, it worked out all right.  I ended up getting my car towed, but...  Why?  Because I left so quick out of the house, I forgot to grab my license, and the cop was 
[02:16:30]  like, hey, where's your stuff?  And I was like, oh, I don't have it.  Yeah, so they towed my car, but it was cool.  I had my girlfriend come pick me up.  You towed your car for not having your license on you?  License registration order.  You raped him with a plunger.  And you took our advice, you engaged the reporter in a little conversation.  I tried, the guys.  You know, we've done the air horns, the costumes, now the latest thing is to just kind of engage  the reporter as he's trying to do his live report.  Yeah, you're standing next to him, just having a little chit-chat.  A little chit-chat.  Absolutely.  Let's go to your audio. 
[02:17:00]  The video is up on opianthony.com, but listen to this.  The search dogs actually missed the 10-year-old boy the first time they went by that house.  Don't know if that matters now.  He's a little dehydrated with a few cuts and bruises, but he'll be okay.  We're live in Perth Amboy tonight with some company.  Jeff Begay's Channel 7 Eyewitness News.  Everybody celebrating out there.  Jeff, thank you.  Everybody celebrating out there.  Oh, no, that guy's not celebrating.  That's a pest.  That's a pest.  That's a pest.  Oh, man.  We think you might be in the lead, Wheel. 
[02:17:30]  Maybe.  Wow, that'd be great.  It could go either way, but we like the subtle approach that you took, and I think you might  be the new leader in the Assault on the Media contest for October.  Mike.  Excellent, guys.  We have to kind of study the tapes after the show.  It's definitely hard.  It's got to be judged on a whole other thing.  The other dude having the presence of mind to jump on either side of the person's shoulders.  Yeah, that was really good.  The shrill in his voice.  Yelling.  He's pulling out his hair.  Pulling out his hair.  He's pulling his hair out. 
[02:18:00]  All right, guys.  I've got to get this truck inspected.  I'll talk to you later, man.  All right.  Thank you, Wheels.  No problem.  Or Wheel, whatever.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  There he goes, Wheels.  Wheels.  Helping out the show.  Got a cool nickname and everything.  Hey, Wheels.  The video's up on opiumanthony.com.  It's 1955.  Yeah.  They call me Sticks.  I play the drums.  Oh, God.  Fucking JP from BAB.  Listening to our show a little too closely.  All right. 
[02:18:30]  Stop, JP.  You're embarrassing yourself.  Oh, no.  Guy used to work for me.  He's an intern.  And now he does mornings at BAB.  And he basically did our There's No Santa bit and got some coverage on that.  And now he's doing the whole two million, the Doppler two million bit.  No way.  Yeah, he is.  The Doppler two million.  Again, JP, you're going to hear this later because you're listening to the replay.  Stop.  Does he call himself the Punisher?  Stop.  Stop, JP.  Stop.  Stop.  Now, that's, you know, because I heard that Doppler two million bit on a different station 
[02:19:00]  before I brought it in.  So they are bringing, just stop, JP, please.  Steve came up with this thing as far as the assault on the media contest goes.  Breaking news now.  Listeners of XM Satellite Radio's Opie and Anthony program have taken the radio show's assault  on the media promotion to a disturbing new level.  Originally, fans of the two radio hosts have been tormenting television news reporters. 
[02:19:30]  Recently, a rogue faction of fans calling themselves pests has taken the promotion one  step further, and some are saying too far.  A pizzeria in Staten Island, New York, was struck last week.  Yo, you got too much of the corner in the car.  Oh, my God.  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio.  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio.  What the fuck is your problem?  Meanwhile, in a hospital delivery room in Duluth.  Congratulations, Mrs. Phelps.  You got a brand new baby. 
[02:20:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Whoopsie.  And in a confessional booth in Boston, Massachusetts.  Forgive me, Father, for I've sinned.  It's been six weeks since I listened to Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  O and A party rock.  XM 202.  In your face, Father.  Eww, what the Christ is your problem, man?  And finally, in a parkway rest area in New Jersey. 
[02:20:30]  Hey, down here.  Opie and Anthony XM 202.  O and A party rock.  Shh.  No one knows for sure where these so-called pests will strike next.  But one thing is certain.  The Opie and Anthony XM virus is spreading.  Jesus, Steve.  You got a new name.  Over the top, Steve.  Was that a promo for an assault on the media? 
[02:21:00]  Why were they in an emergency room?  No, see, they're taking the concept to the next level.  Now they're just assaulting.  Assaulting everything.  Everything.  All over the place.  My God.  Assaulting society in general.  Right, Steve?  Right.  That's the concept.  Yeah.  I like when Steve explains the concepts after we play these things.  Right.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Steve.  Now I get it.  After I've been...  Explain the concept of the latest promo you just made.  The concept was actually brought to me by...  Quiet.  Eric.  That was Eric's idea. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, my God.  Look, he instantly...  No, no, no.  He doesn't see us going, wow, oh, my God, that is the funniest thing that really...  We're asking a couple of questions about it, so he instantly goes, that was Eric's idea.  The former head of FEMA is going to be coming to here apologizing.  I did the best job I thought I could do.  Even if you guys were jerking off all over it, I'd still give credit to Eric.  So, his concept was pests would be like assaulting the other XM channels, I think. 
[02:22:00]  Like, so you'd hear like an XM jock singing a song.  So, we tried that a little bit and it died after like 15 seconds.  Boring!  Yeah.  We couldn't go anywhere with it.  So, we sat around and said, all right, well, where wouldn't you have an assault on the media?  You know, and so all of a sudden, we're like, restaurant...  Where wouldn't you?  Yeah.  Was this a brainstorming meeting?  It was.  Like, you sit together and go, all right, here's a list of places you wouldn't want somebody  shouting out O&A party room.  And what were some of the places that suggested it, but you didn't go there?  You didn't.  We didn't go with...  I'm trying to think, because there were so many ideas. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, so many.  Anybody?  Help.  Does anyone remember?  Nathaniel?  I like fans like...  What are you rolling their hands for?  Wide range of characters.  It was all I know.  Yeah, Nathaniel's wide range.  Playing Brad Garrett.  I mean, just spot on.  Sounded nothing like the character he did in that one.  Yeah, but that's just bad.  That's the beauty of these.  But fan delivery is unchangeable.  I'm going to defend Finn.  I think it's brilliant.  Now we've got to play the Raymond bit promo.  He sounds just like Brad Garrett. 
[02:23:00]  I challenge you.  Fuck those tribute bands that were just in here.  Listen to this.  This is true.  Next time, on a very special Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray's brother needs a helping hand.  Ray, I've got a problem, man.  You've got to help me.  No.  I picked up a tranny last night at Hunts Point, and there was an accident.  No.  We were trying this erotic asphyxiation thing, and he, she was supposed to pitch me before  it ran out of air.  What are you doing?  But Ray's father isn't buying it.  What a load of bull.  Come on.  All right, you got me.  I picked him up on 10th Avenue. 
[02:23:30]  The family hijinks don't stop there.  Ray, you've got to help me get rid of the body.  I don't want to do it.  No, come on.  It'll be fun.  We'll chop it up and bury it out in Jersey.  I live on Long Island.  All in the next, Everybody Loves Raymond.  Tonight at 8.  Bravo, Than, bravo.  Thanks, Opie.  You know, it gets harder when the impression gets longer than two words.  We'll bury it out on Long Island.  It's just the Than.  I didn't know I was doing a Brad Garrett until halfway through that.  You did.  You knew exactly what you were doing.  It sounds just like Brad Garrett. 
[02:24:00]  Did you try to do a different voice?  Well, they have to have, like, before, or does it just come out like that?  I tried to sound like somebody who had just got in trouble for accidentally killing  a transsexual.  But it sounded just like you describing it just there.  Well, he's doing Brad Garrett again.  Wait a minute.  Just now.  Keep doing it.  He's like those actors.  Afterwards, they just, you know, they can't let the character go.  Yeah, he's caught up in the character.  I can't find the off switch.  I don't know what's going on.  And that sounded just like the guy in the thing we just heard.  Exactly.  Assault on the media bit.  Assault on the media promo.  But I got excited in that one, so that was cool. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, barely.  You barely got excited.  I screamed like a maniac.  I thought that was somebody else.  Yeah.  So then I did a good job.  Then you must have done a good job.  I'll be right.  Jesus Christ.  The thing was good.  The holding back your scream, you know that.  You're yelling.  Yeah, his scream is like total monotone, but louder.  Yeah, just louder.  I am upset.  I am upset.  It's a higher monotone.  Well, it's because he was in a church, you know.  He didn't want to disrupt too much.  Just enough.  Just a little. 
[02:25:00]  In your face.  Father.  Father.  Father.  Now you're just exaggerating.  Now it's exaggeration to be funny.  You're right.  How'd that work out with Harry?  Well, I got 100% of the votes.  100% of the votes against Harry.  So you will not be losing your hair.  Nope.  Neither will our staff.  Harry's got to shave his head, I guess, and so does Lil Fezzy.  Lil Fezzy.  Lil Fezzy, yeah.  Lil Fezzy-ass too, because you were judged funnier.  Yes.  Because one judge called up.  Yep.  Yes. 
[02:25:30]  Ron and Fez will be talking about this a lot today on their show.  One judge.  Starting at 11 right after this program.  They will.  202, which is Obie's way of saying he's done with it.  Well, congratulate.  I just wanted to congratulate you, Thang.  I never felt the bit.  I've got to be honest with you.  It has nothing to do with you.  I just don't want to do bits with Harry.  I just don't like him.  Well, you just, you know what it is.  I know what it is.  I know what it is.  It's not so much not feeling in the bit, because who wouldn't be into some kind of  you're funnier than this guy bit, or you're not as funny as this guy bit.  It works.  You just don't like Harry so much. 
[02:26:00]  You want no involvement with Harry at all.  I don't want anything to do with him.  Right.  No.  There's people I don't like, but I know that.  And he's not even the one that's shit under my desk.  There's a lot of people I don't like, but I know they can do good radio, so we go with  it.  There's nothing there for me.  Nothing.  Not feeling it.  No.  And it has nothing to do with you, Nathaniel, because I know we've kind of turned our backs  on you a little bit.  We know you're funny.  We like your humor.  I like the dryness and the sarcasm.  But I just wasn't feeling the competition with Harry.  He was just jettisoned from the show like garbage.  Well, we went with it in the beginning, and I'm like, ugh, why is this guy even in our 
[02:26:30]  studio?  Yeah.  I just couldn't even look at him.  Like other guys come in like Bill.  They've got interesting stories.  Bill, the intern.  Right, right.  Comes in, and he's just a psychopath or something.  Harry was just like, ugh.  And he's kind of, I don't know, and he's pompous.  Yeah.  In a weird way.  I don't know what it is.  A little smug.  Smug, you think?  No part of him.  I just like that word.  But Ron and Fez will be writing this bit, and they'll make it funny, and they'll have a good  time with it, so listen to Ron and Fez today.  I'm sure Nathaniel will be on the show discussing it further, right? 
[02:27:00]  Congrats, Nathaniel.  Thank you very much.  Thank you for your support, Anthony.  Oh, I definitely called up and had to support you.  Yes.  The fact that he just rips off Seinfeld bits.  If you're going to rip off somebody's frigging material, the Seinfeld thermostat bit, I mean,  it's a classic Seinfeld.  Trying to get a little more obscure.  Yeah.  All right.  Joe Rogan.  Steve, thank you.  Joe Rogan.  Yeah, he doesn't mind.  No, he doesn't care.  I'll kick his ass.  Rear naked choke.  Hey, we're talking about Brian Wilson. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  On Imus.  Uh-huh.  Well, it's actually Rob Bartlett doing this Brian Wilson character.  Hysterical.  It's taking over the world on TV.  Love it.  It really is.  Imus is riding this one, and he's helping us out in the process because he's wearing an  Opie and Anthony t-shirt and calling Imus Opie, and then Imus is giving us huge plugs  on MSNBC.  Telling where to get the t-shirts.  Yeah, he's a fan and a friend, certainly, right?  Yeah.  So, we got some audio of the Brian Wilson character doing weather.  Listen to this.  Cosmel in Cancun to get the worst of the storm system today. 
[02:28:00]  How am I supposed to keep continuing with this?  Brian Wilson, listen to this.  Let's send him down.  Let's send him down to Cosmel in Cancun.  O-N-A party rock, let's get Joe Blue.  He's doing assaults on the media, too.  That's an assault on the media.  He got behind the weather guy and started freaking out.  Very good.  And then Imus had a whole discussion about my brother's t-shirts, just in case you missed 
[02:28:30]  it from earlier today.  We'll play this again here.  Okay.  Anthony, D.D.'s outside the studio.  She's trying to pitch a show.  D.D.'s from Washington?  She's trying to pitch a show for 202.  Is it a mix?  Two Chicks and a Dick or something like that?  Yep.  That's the name of the show, right?  Two Chicks and a Dick?  And we got excerpts.  All right, we'll talk to D.D. after the break.  The guy's name is Dick, who's the co-host.  Yeah, it must be.  Have you met D.D. yet?  No, I haven't.  She's a lovely, lovely lady, Bill. 
[02:29:00]  Mythbusters and a jackass?  Is that what they're pitching?  Shock jocks.  Shock jock radio with lawsuits.  I like it.  Here's Imus talking about us and t-shirts and everything else.  How's Opie and Anthony doing, by the way?  I see you have their t-shirt on.  I don't know.  How are you, Opie?  08 Party Rock XM 202.  Someone in my family stole my Opie and Anthony t-shirt, and they're on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:29:30]  You can't get another Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  Well, you can, but you have to get a hold of Opie's brother.  It's a process.  And Opie's brother, what's his brother's name, do you know?  Elmo.  Elmo.  You have to get a hold of Opie's brother, Elmo.  What were their parents thinking about, by the way?  Opie and Elmo.  Anyway, you have to get a hold of Elmo.  Your sister, Betty Bumper Jack.  I knew the hell knows where Elmo is.  But Elmo, he eventually will send you the shirt.  Yeah, you just got to meet him with cash. 
[02:30:00]  You have to pay for the shirt ahead of time.  And then, I guess what he does is he makes them once he gets the money.  So, how much are they?  About 19, 20 bucks on my head or more?  Well, it depends.  Double XL, get out of that fat boy's surcharge.  Anyway, 28 after the art.  There you go.  Our buddy, our pal, Imus, helping out the show earlier this morning.  Thank you, Imus.  Thank you. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  We appreciate that.  I'll get all over here, okay?  Hey, you know how we've been doing the news teases?  Yeah.  That's always funny to me.  Yeah.  I love the Imus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the outrageous news teases?  Our favorite is still in the machine here.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  Oh.  Ah.  Well, South Park has jumped on the bandwagon.  The South Park season has begun.  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  And they're doing a little bit on that.  Ooh.  Want to hear some audio?  Sure.  Tom, I'm currently 10 miles outside of Beaverton, unable to get inside the town proper.  We do not have any reports of fatalities yet, but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions.  Beaverton has only a population of about 8,000, Tom, so this would be quite devastating.  Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch?  We're not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of Beaverton, Tom, but we're reporting that there's looting, raping, and, yes, even acts of cannibalism. 
[02:31:30]  My God, you've actually seen people looting, raping, and eating each other.  No, no, we haven't actually seen it, Tom.  We're just reporting it.  Fucking brilliant.  Yeah, that's great.  Fucking brilliant.  Something we've been discussing on the show for many, many weeks.  They're obviously referring to, you know, the old hurricane.  The hurricane, yeah.  Hurricane Katrina.  That is really good.  That's funny, Matt.  Very funny. 
[02:32:00]  You were saying in the office, too, that originally they said they were going to get, like, 10,000 victims out of this thing.  Yeah, remember?  Fox News and CNN, they were reporting the death toll, the projected death toll, and it was well into the tens of thousands.  It was, like, at least 10,000 or 15,000.  Right.  Other people said 20.  Well, they finally tallied up all the dead in New Orleans.  Is this an official total?  Yeah.  The official total was 990.  It was just short of 1,000 people that perished. 
[02:32:30]  A lot of people.  But when you got panicky peats on the news saying 10,000 people.  Over and over again.  Yeah, 15,000 people dead.  Throwing a fear at us.  Yeah.  Day in and day out.  And then the number comes out.  It's less than 1,000, which is a relief, you've got to think, for the people in that area.  When you had Geraldo and all these other clowns standing there pointing at a dead body, Shepard Smith, in the street and saying, you know, this man is just laying here dead. 
[02:33:00]  Countless others in countless other places here in New Orleans.  Others under the water in their houses.  This will be a huge death toll.  We're going to find thousands of people dead in their attics.  Yeah, that's what they thought.  So the total comes out.  Where was it reported?  Like on page 89?  Yeah, I felt like it was a little snippet in the paper.  It wasn't the big headline, right?  No.  It wasn't on the front page.  Nothing like that.  What are they going to write?  We fucked up.  Yeah.  Tens of thousands.  Not dead. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Alive.  Alive.  What a miracle.  Got another clip from South Park.  This is a Fox News update.  Global warming disaster.  Global warming appears to have struck as predicted in the Colorado Rockies.  All around the country, panic and chaos are settling in.  Tom, I'm standing just outside of Chicago where the panic of global warming has already caused countless deaths.  Already we're reporting that the death toll here in Chicago is over 600 billion people.  With the crickets in the background. 
[02:34:00]  Fuck it, South Park.  Oh, that is good.  That show's been on for so long, and I swear, just when I think, eh, maybe they've run their course and everything, you watch an episode and go, no, this shit is still fucking funny.  They're still doing it.  Bravo to those guys, Matt and Trey and the gang.  That's really funny.  That is true, though.  Every time I see that show, it's hilarious.  Yeah, it's hysterical.  It's like sophomoric and, like, brilliant at the same time. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Cartman kills me every time.  You know, you'd think that character would get old after 10 years, but hysterical.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And then Steve's very, very upset today because over 50 people have sent this clip in today.  50.  Get Steve.  Steve, whenever something happens, Steve gets it sent to him not once, not twice, but sometimes hundreds of times.  Right, Steve?  Yeah.  What's this clip about? 
[02:35:00]  Everyone thought this was very important to send to you so we could play on the show today.  There's an animated series on Comedy Central called Drawn Together, and it's a bunch of superheroes, I think.  And, you know, it's another one of these referential kind of comedies like The Simpsons and Family Guy in South Park.  And they referenced the word shwogie last night.  Really?  And that clip was coming in all night.  All night.  We're starting to think that we might have came up with the term shwogie.  Wow.  Or the old Boston.  If we could influence society like that.  We have to find an earlier use of the term shwogie, earlier than 1995, 96. 
[02:35:30]  96 or, yeah, about 96.  96.  Find an earlier usage, and they'll get credit for it.  But as far as I'm concerned, we invented, hoo-hoo, the word shwogie.  Bruce Mittman.  Thank you.  They made TV yesterday.  Damn you all.  I almost finished what my ancestors started, and I would have gotten away with it, too, 
[02:36:00]  if it wasn't for that meddling shwogie.  Shwogie.  Is it Yiddish or not?  Is it a Yiddish term?  Yeah, it is.  I got a definition last night.  It is a Yiddish word.  It's like a hybrid, if you will.  Well, let's get the Yids to call and tell us.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Is that bad?  I really don't know.  It's kind of derogatory.  To call them Yids?  Well, what is shwogie?  That isn't exactly not derogatory.  Yeah, but for some reason, that's fine.  But see, Anthony's a racist, so he didn't really... 
[02:36:30]  I am not a racist.  That didn't really filter at all in his brain.  Yidd.  I just want to talk to a Yidd.  What is the definition?  Yeah, what is the definition?  Of a shwogie.  What is it?  Give me the definition.  If you got the definition last night.  Or did I already hear the definition at the Hard Rock Cafe?  I think you probably heard it at the Hard Rock during your first appearance numerous times.  Yeah, what a crowd we had there.  Wow.  Wow, did they just go off. 
[02:37:00]  Without even any provocation, you know?  I'll give it to them if they're provoked.  Yeah, but then there was no reprimand on any level.  Oh, because that would work.  There was the...  And there was reprimand.  I went, oh, now, stop it.  What are you doing?  What is that?  You can't reprimand these people.  They'll kill you.  The word comes from a combination of the Yiddish or bastardized German word for black,  Schwatze, and boogie short for...  Jesus.  Jigaboo. 
[02:37:30]  What?  So the word is pronounced shwogie.  That's the definition I got emailed last night.  From where?  A Yiddish.  From who?  From a Yiddish person.  Or a Jewish person.  That's horrendous.  I don't buy it.  No.  I have no idea how to verify that I've been speaking with a Jewish person.  All right.  Yeah.  My dad used it.  Josh.  Let's say hi to Josh.  Hey, Josh.  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Josh.  I don't know anything about the Yiddish term, but I know when I was a kid, I grew up in 
[02:38:00]  a redneck family in Bucks County, PA, and my father used to call him shwiggies all the  time.  I was about eight years old.  I'm 33 now.  All right.  So maybe we didn't invent the word, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hey, whoo-hoo, Robin.  At least we can admit that we didn't invent everything.  All right.  We're going to break.  You guys are like bummed out.  We didn't invent that word of hate.  Kind of bummed.  Kind of bummed.  We were excited.  We're excited with the original, with that slur. 
[02:38:30]  We're excited.  At least we acknowledged when we didn't invent something.  That slur.  Oh, wow.  There we go.  I mean, you're still young, man.  You can come up with a new racist term.  It's so hard, though.  So many have been taken and all the good ones.  Well, pick an obscure group.  No one really wants to work on a new one.  Like Eskimos.  No one really dislikes the Eskimo.  Is there a good one for an Eskimo?  Bill.  Does anyone dislike an Eskimo enough where that would catch on enough people?  White people in Alaska?  I'm sure they got some for.  You need a group of people that a lot of people don't like, for whatever reason. 
[02:39:00]  And that would work.  How about, well, Vietnamese had Charlie or Gook.  Dude, you can't, the level of hatred that it just, when I was in Georgia, they had a  word for women that they weren't into, like they were called Bamas.  Like somehow Alabama was considered more fucked up than Georgia.  Georgia?  No, no.  Bama.  Because they're called Buffalo Bettys in Buffalo.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying, though.  Buffalo Bettys.  I'm saying that there's, yeah, there's obscure shit.  Little localized.  Yeah, so there's no way if you talk to somebody from maybe Juno or fucking Anchorage that they 
[02:39:30]  don't have something for an Eskimo.  True.  True.  Okay.  You fucking harpoon chucker.  And by the way, Bill, you blubberita.  Yeah, you.  You don't give me enough credit.  I've been trying to come up with a new word for a long time.  Oh.  For one.  Okay.  And I came up with the word kunk.  It's not in the dictionary.  Yeah, but it didn't really catch on.  I know, but I tried.  And what is it?  We, well, you know, you call a girl a kunk.  It's just because it sounded like the C word, though.  Well, you know, we try to get that going. 
[02:40:00]  Is it a combination?  There's no, no, there's no word.  Like Larpenter?  Is that like a cunt?  I invented the word kunk.  C-U-N-K.  Look it up.  There's no word in the dictionary yet.  All right.  How about a definition?  We need a good definition.  Then we could, like, hand it in.  So it's a word before a definition is even.  We're feeling the whole where you call someone a kunk.  But that's as far as we got with the new word.  Yeah, it's like fugly.  Yeah, yeah.  I understand.  But don't you think by now kunk should be a word? 
[02:40:30]  We've been around a long time.  We were told we weren't allowed to use the word kunk either on the air.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  After we used it a while, we were told, yeah.  We were told not to use it.  Yeah, on commercial radio, we started calling girls and stuff kunks.  New kunk.  And they actually sat us down in an office and told us we just weren't allowed to use a word that doesn't exist.  That's how crazy commercial radio got.  Yeah, because they knew what you were doing.  But that doesn't matter.  That's not what the FCC is about.  They did. 
[02:41:00]  Well, I mean, you could sing songs like get the funk out of my face.  I mean, you know what he was trying to say.  Right.  Back in the disco era.  Right.  A Coke spoon around your neck.  A couple of Photoshop showing up with me in an action figure box with my new shotgun that I got yesterday.  And me on the cover of Clint Eastwood movie.  Me in the video of the Columbine, the closed circuit Columbine.  That's a little twisted.  Killing. 
[02:41:30]  Outside the bank in Dog Day Afternoon.  Yep.  And a couple of them in a G.I. Joe box.  Me walking with the Earps in Tombstone.  Tombstone, yeah.  A bunch of clowns.  Very funny.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  As we go to break, we're going to play the Kaplan Brothers, their latest creation, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that's a good one.  Wabbit season, duck season. 
[02:42:00]  What's that noise?  Daffy coming up to me, and I gather I shoot his bill off.  I'm watching this.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  There's Daffy getting shot.  There you go.  You're going to have to go to whackbag.com.  W-A-C-K-Bag.com.  Go to Photoshop.  They do a good job every day.  Yeah.  Photoshop's based on the Daily Show.  Okay.  The Kaplan Brothers from Silence of the Lambs, the musical, the CD's out there.  These guys are touring the country now in small theaters with this whole thing. 
[02:42:30]  And here's a song they came up with that is not on the CD.  They were proud of, and they sent to us directly.  So here it is.  Would you fuck me?  I'd fuck me.  I'd fuck me hard.  I'd fuck me so hard.  It's over.  No, still, I'm over.  Screaming from afar, getting on my nerves 
[02:43:00]  Hey, you in the mirror with the lovely set of curves  Such a pretty face, full inviting lips  Multiple tattoos, child-bearing hips  There's a whole lot of fish in the sea  But none of those bitches are me  Take a chance, never know in the end if you're gonna get lucky  Would you fuck me?  I'd fuck me hard  I'd fuck myself so fucking hard 
[02:43:30]  This butterfly shed its cocoon  It's spreading its wings straight for the stars  Once I cut off the meat  I'll be ready, complete  And I'd fuck me so hard  Lipstick and mascara  Nipple with a ring  Close to being done  Let me hide my thing  I'd buy me a drink  Get lost in my eyes  I'd flirt and I'd wink 
[02:44:00]  I'd seduce me with lies  The guys at the bar  They'd ignore me  They'd dodge me and duck me  But now they'd fuck me  I'd fuck me too  I'd fuck me fucking black and blue  This basement's a castle  And Billy's the king  Or is it queen?  Either way, I'm in charge  Once I finish the dress  I'll be perfect, the best  Why would anyone bless?  Cast me out, the answer's yes  Yes, I'd fuck me so hard 
[02:44:30]  Hey, asshole, thank you for the scraps  Instead, I think I'll set a trap  I'll probably do  But I just got a brilliant idea  Precious, come here  I'd fuck me 
[02:45:00]  I'd fuck me well  I'd fuck me till I burn in hell  I'd have me  I'd do me  I'd rape me  I'd screw me  And get in the back of a car  I'd stop me  I'd chase me  I'd fuck me  I'd chase me  I won't  I'd look very far  I'd be grateful  For placing me  Back in my friends  And fuck me  So hard  Wow, across America 
[02:45:30]  True tales from the road  Real people, real stories  Real boobs  I just want to thank them sexy little minxes in that Cavalier on Monday that wowed me on I-24  Right before I crossed into Tennessee going eighth bound  That blonde was so fucking hot with her creamy white boobies and her beautiful big pink nipples on the end  Yeah, this is Mike the Trucker over here on Interstate 70, 20 miles outside of Baltimore, Maryland 
[02:46:00]  I had this real high-class, high-maintenance women come up beside me pointed to my sticker and whipped her right titty out  And it was really fine looking  Appreciate it, thanks guys  I'm on Interstate 10, East, West, and Louisiana  I'm on the 103  I just got wowed by this  I guess they're nice  I'm gay  I guess they're nice  I don't know  If you get wowed, call the Opie and Anthony wow line 
[02:46:30]  866-WOW-ME-05  And if you need a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com  I'm very proud of my big tip  I'm good to meet you  I hope you get my name  Oh yeah  I want buzz in you  Is the nature of my name  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Woohoo!  Woohoo!  Woohoo! 
[02:47:00]  Woohoo!  All right  People are starting their evacuation from Orlando  Why are they leaving Orlando?  Hurricane Wilma  I'm flying there in a couple of weeks  You know  I am  I'll be there  I'm going to see the bodies floating down the street  I'm going right for the hurricane  I'm going exclusively just to see what Hurricane Wilma is all about  You are not flying into Orlando Friday  Yes I am  And I will not be flying into Miami Saturday 
[02:47:30]  By the way, Friday is tomorrow  No, they'll have  You will not be flying in  They're leaving now  Doesn't matter  You think the people at the airport are going to be waiting?  Yeah  You know what's going to happen?  The survivors are going to be raping each other inside that Epcot ball  The big Epcot ball?  Yeah  That's going to be their Superdome  The Epcot ball will be floating  That's all they'll show from the helicopter  It rolls over slowly  You're not getting to Disney until Monday  I am leaving Friday  I am checking in  I will enjoy  You're not going to make it to Orlando tomorrow 
[02:48:00]  I will absolutely  Orlando  You know what?  They just showed a live shot  People are leaving Orlando  You think the people that work at the airport are going to go  Ah, we'll wait  We'll wait until Anthony lands  This hurricane has to make a drastic UE  They have no idea where it's going as far as the U-turn goes  Wrong  Yes  When a hurricane is going straight  They've got a pretty good idea  If there's no steering winds  Which way it's going  When it's got to make that boomerang hook like it's going to do  They just know  They don't know where it's going to end up  This thing could end up hitting 
[02:48:30]  It's following a pattern that they've seen many, many times  No  They just don't know exactly where it's going to hit  Not only that  Not only that  But Orlando isn't on the beach  There's enough real estate there  Where that thing will be a category  If it hits at a 4 on the coast  It'll be a 2 by the time it hits Orlando  That's not what I heard  Anthony  That's not what I heard  That's not what I heard  I heard it's coming in  You're coming in hard, man  You better hope the people that are working at the airport  Have the same logic as you is what I'm saying  Who needs to work there?  You've got one guy with the friggin' lights in his hand  To bring me to the terminal  The other guy that pressed the button to bring the terminal thing up 
[02:49:00]  In the words of Jim Norton  There's going to be a lot of panicky peats down there  Not on Friday  And they are going to be leaving their jobs to go to safety  Not on Friday  You will not be flying into Orlando tomorrow  You watch me  This guy's broadcasting from Orlando on Fox  Pull him up  What's he saying?  No, this is  What's he saying?  Evacuation orders actually for non-residents and tourists  That went out yesterday  And the truth is a lot of those non-residents and tourists did heed those orders 
[02:49:30]  They are pretty much gone  But you still have a whole lot of people who are in this area  I can tell you this much, John, also  Now we do know that Wilma, she is a Category 4 right now  And it appears according to Max Mayfield  As if this thing is going to stretch out a little bit longer  Here in the Keys, Monroe County officials have decided that they're going to wait  24 hours before they make it mandatory for residents of the Keys area to get the big on boot and get on out of here  Swing it behind me, Chris, if you could a little bit  Swing it  What's going on right now is here  They're boarding up windows again 
[02:50:00]  Let me tell you what's going to happen with this hurricane  Let meteorologist Anthony tell you  This thing is going to clip the Yucatan Peninsula  It's going to weaken  And then it's going to go into the Gulf  And not make as hefty a U-turn as they say  It's going to weaken because the water is just not as warm as it was where it was  And it's just going to continue to weaken  And it'll probably hit somewhere  I hope that fucking thing comes right back around  That thing ain't going to do shit 
[02:50:30]  It just fucking smacks you in your fucking plane  And it certainly ain't going to hurt my flight tomorrow  I will, my flight will be on time  I will go down there  And it'll be wonderful  Even if you land  This is denial  This is total denial  Without a doubt  Because you'll be in your hotel for a few hours  One day I'll have some rain  And then you're going to have to evacuate and go north for a while  And don't tell me hurricanes don't do damage in Orlando  Have you ever seen Disney destroyed  My sister lives in Orlando and she lost her roof  Disney has never been destroyed by a hurricane  And some of those big trees just disappeared 
[02:51:00]  Let me tell you something  While the wind's blowing and everyone's freaking out  You know what I'll be hearing?  Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me  That's what I'll be hearing  Please stand clear of the monorail doors as they close  He's going to be drinking bath water  With fucking mouse ears on his head by Saturday  I'm supposed to fly into Miami Saturday and then  Now that's a problem  And they go somewhere after that  Miami on Saturday  Well, I'm just hoping that they take a 
[02:51:30]  A fly around it?  Oh, there you go  Tell me how Africa looks  Or if they go the other way  Tell me what Asia looks like  I'm hoping for a fly around  Saturday morning  You're going to have to have it mid-air refueling  To fly around this monster  I'm going to end up in the Catskills for my vacation  I know it  I'm going to be at fucking Lake Placid or something  Come up and see me in Albany  You're going to be in the Catskills  I'll be there on Sunday, man  No one puts Opie in a corner  I'm going to be in the fucking Adirondacks  Like horseback riding  I don't want to do that  I don't want to be scuba diving 
[02:52:00]  It ain't happening  You're going to be scuba diving at Disney, I think  At least I'm not delusional, man  We're both fucked  Do you know  We're both fucked  It's far enough inland and to the east in Florida  Where that much land, it's fine  There'll be some rain  There'll be a lot of rain and wind  But I wouldn't worry about it  Walt built all that in  Walt knew that hurricanes hit down there  Walt was dead when they built Disney World 
[02:52:30]  But he knew  Let's go to O-Town  Kelly and O-Town  O-Town, check it in  Hey, I don't  O-Town, what a bunch of pussies  I'm actually from Orlando  But listen, I was here last year  You've got the pussy, man  During all those hurricanes  Yeah  First ones in 40 years  They are a bunch of pussies  Everybody boarded up their windows in Orlando  But we did have flatline winds  80 mile an hour  Which is the freakiest thing I've ever seen  It doesn't gust  It's just solid winds  And by the way, Anthony  Disney shut down  Like for the first time ever 
[02:53:00]  Because you know those money hungry bitches  Uh-huh  They don't shut down for anything  They shut down last year for that  So if you're planning on going and seeing Donald  Good luck  If these pussies panic again  No, they won't  You know the PGA Tour  They're playing down there?  Disney?  Yeah  Everything's fine  They're all down there  Everything's dandy  Don't worry about it  Alright, well let's go to Joe in O-Town  Joe?  Yo, what's up?  This guy's stealing all my thunder here  What's up?  What's up?  I was calling about the hurricanes too  I was here for all three of them  And uh 
[02:53:30]  Yeah  Disney was open like the next day  After all of them  Not even  Of course  There was no damage  No damage whatsoever  I don't know what the hell  They're like in a different country over there  Or something  I don't know  Alright  Thank you, Joe  Later, guys  Alright  Well, and then we got  They always evacuate the keys  And then that's it  Everything else is fine  Well, they got  Let's hear Presser  Presser, what's up?  Hey, what's up  B-b-b-boys  Hey  Actually, it's Tresser with a T  That's alright, guys  I live in Port Charlotte, Florida 
[02:54:00]  And I just want to let everyone know  That we're all going to die  Wow, everyone in Florida?  Everyone  Everyone  Every single one just gone  Boom  Alright  Well, the hurricane is slowing down a little bit  Now they're saying Sunday 2 a.m.  It's not even hitting  Wow, it's really  Look, look  It's not supposed to hit  Oh, I'm getting a little excited  Look at that  It's not supposed to hit where I'm going to be  Until Monday afternoon  Monday at 2 a.m.  Yet they're going to close the airport Friday  Saturday at 2 a.m.  It's way over there 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, but that's like right where you've got to go  No, no, I have to go further south from there  But what's that thing right there?  Is that the Yucatan Peninsula thing?  The Yucatan  Alright, so it's going to be over there  Yeah  I'll be in Miami  Then I do the little fly around to my little island  I'm good  I'm good to go  Both of you guys are going to be in  I'm good to go  Bed and breakfast  In Rochester, New York  Vermont  I'm not going horseback riding  And I'm not checking out leaves  I want you scuba dive  The folding are just changing 
[02:55:00]  Shut up  Wonderful  You're going to be one of those  Great orange  Shut up  Those vests  You know with the nose sleeves  Orange parka  Orange vest  Wow, man  If my pilot could do a little loop-de-loo  Where's he going?  I'm going to be fine  I'm going to have to fly over Cuba  I think we're going to have to  Can you fly over Cuba?  I don't think we're allowed to fly over Cuba  Oh, man  Then we're going to have to go all the way down to like Haiti  Not allowed to fly over Cuban airspace  Really?  I really don't think we are  Oh, my God  So how do we do this then? 
[02:55:30]  You've got to kind of go around  They're going to take us all the way around?  Maybe  You've got to go like  You've got to skirt the Gulf Coast  You're going to be able to see like New Orleans  No  And then you've got to go south  Holy crap  You're screwed  How the hell do  That's the problem  Because a stupid Cuba  I still might be screwed  That's in the way  He's going to be diving in Lake Winnipesaukee  Looking at that pirate down  Come back  They don't give up their dead  I know, Bill 
[02:56:00]  That's right  Billburr.com, everyone  You can find the lake monster  All right  Lake George  We've got the guy from Giant Magazine  Coming in to talk about scary Halloween movies  That should be worth about two minutes  And then we've got D.D.  I just lift you the bird  I'll be good  Well deserved  And we've got D.D.  What?  Two chicks and a dick?  Yep  They're coming in in a few minutes  We should get everyone in at the same time  But also, there's a couple other things  We haven't talked about yet  Johnny Carson with the death threats  Who knew this was going on? 
[02:56:30]  I guess the FBI  I guess we didn't either  Huh?  Like I said, I guess we didn't either  Yeah  It's the FBI  It released a bunch of stuff  What was that one letter?  What paper was that in?  I believe it was the Post  You think it was the Post?  I think it was the Post  It's pretty much the same paper  Yeah, but  Even though they're the same paper  You have to find a story  That was only in one  Here in New York  We've got two papers  That everyone pretty much goes for  The Daily News and The Post  And they both claim  That the other one's evil  And the other one's not 
[02:57:00]  But they're the same paper  They're the same exact paper  But they're in major competition  Opie just trying to fill time  As we scamper  Trying to find this story  Well, whatever  He got  I got it, I got it  Page 99  I just want to  You just got to read that one death threat letter  That you read in the office  Okay, here's what he got  It was kind of scary  1974  Or 1974 note from some guy  In North Carolina  Talking about he was going to kill Johnny Carson  He said  I have nothing to lose  I will be in Hollywood 
[02:57:30]  To carry out the threat  If the money is not sent  P.S.  How is your wife?  I am a homicidal maniac  That's his P.S.  That's his postscript  Like he wrote it  And signed it  And then went  Oh  Yeah  By the way  I'm a homicidal maniac  By the way  If up top  Didn't fill me in  I'm crazy  Part about wanting to kill you  And I have nothing to lose  I better put a P.S.  I really didn't come across 
[02:58:00]  As a nut on this  I better tell him  Homicidal maniac  Why would you want to kill Johnny?  Like what was that?  Comics?  Bitter comics?  That got bumped?  Didn't get the couch?  Yeah I know  It could have been  Something like that  Because that is  Of all the people  You could have killed  During 1974  Who would you want to kill?  74?  There were probably  A lot of like  Political things  And you know  Nixon  Mike Douglas  Yeah he was a prick  I don't know  Mike in Jersey 
[02:58:30]  Yes  Oh man  Everybody  How are you guys doing?  Alright  Listen  The only airline  That's allowed to fly  Over Cuba  Is Jamaica Air  So if you can get a flight  On Jamaica Air  That's the only airline  That's allowed to fly  Over their airspace  Oh yeah?  So you can get in  Get out  It's beautiful  That's why  I went down to Jamaica  Last year  It took all of  3 hours and 20 minutes  To fly down  Because they can fly  Straight over  This guy  This guy here is saying  Commercial flight  Flying instruments  Can fly over Cuba 
[02:59:00]  They provide permission  To commercial flights  As well as  IFR instrument  Non-commercial  I'm a pilot  Take care  Nick the pilot  I'm a private pilot  And you can fly over Cuba  With an overflight permit  You have to pay fees  To the Cuban government  I fly to the Caymans  All the time  Right over Cuba  There you go  We learned something  On this show  When people say  This show isn't educational  I want to slap them  In the head  That's right  So they're not worried 
[02:59:30]  About us spying on them anymore  Just get a permit  Like what could we  Possibly see there  That we would care about  There's no Soviet Union  Yeah  There's cigar production  We got satellites  That could zoom right in  On that  Don't need the old  You know  Pilot in the U-2  Spy plane anymore  You know they have a park  Named after John Lennon  In Cuba  No way  The John Lennon Park  Stop it  Swear to God  You sure it isn't the  It's a statue  Vladimir Lennon Park  Nope  It's a statue that looks like  John Lennon the Beatle  And it has real glasses on it 
[03:00:00]  And no one steals the glasses  Really?  Yeah I learned it  Because they'll saw the hands up  Does it say John or just Lennon?  I swear to God  It's a park  Named after John Lennon  In Cuba  Wow  That sounds like  A little strange  It's a bench with John Lennon  Sitting on it  It's a sculpture  Really?  It has real glasses  Yeah  I watched the Audio Slave DVD  And they visited the John Lennon Park  Do they have a Ringo Stalin statue also?  And they were amazed that no one steals  The quiet commie  No one really steals the glasses 
[03:00:30]  The statue's been  Well they'll be shot  If they're real glasses on a statue  And no one steals the glasses really  Is that it right there Hawk?  There you go  A tribute from Havana to John Lennon  In the 60's  How about that?  That's one of the great things about having a dictator  Yeah  Is that that kind  The same kind of fear that you're trying to instill  With your shotgun out there  Right  Yes  Is the kind of fear that a guy like Saddam Hussein  You saw him not even recognizing that court yesterday  Right  Who are you?  Saddam rules now 
[03:01:00]  And I know they want to give him the death penalty  Like they're trying to hang him  On this stuff  But I would feel bad if they hung him  He's coming off as a much cooler guy  As a prisoner  Than he ever did as a dictator  Now he's  He absolutely  Says  When they ask him about  What he thinks about  The election taking place  Or the Americans  Or anything  He just says  This  I don't know what you're talking about  I'm  I'm the president of Iraq  Like he will not acknowledge that he is not the president  He's 
[03:01:30]  In his mind  He's still the president  He is going to be running things again  This is just a minor inconvenience  What do you think is going through his head?  Because you know his ego is like  There's no way this is  I'm going down on this  And the person who's like  Like questioning him  You know he's just thinking of all the different kinds of ways  He's going to torture him  Oh yeah  The torture chamber will open up  And this prosecuting attorney  I would light his right to fall on fire  Yeah  While sawing his ear off  When I am back  Your family  The pain your family will feel  Like that's just his fantasy going on in that head  You've got to think 
[03:02:00]  In the back of the judge's mind  He's thinking  There is a slight possibility  That not only are we not going to prove shit  He's going to be the leader again  And I'm fucked  Well it's happened in the past  People have been exiled  And then a government comes in  They run things for a while  They get chased out by some fanatics  And the exiled leader is a hero  He comes back a hero  Back in power  It's happened before  He's studying faces in that courtroom right now  Like the Ayatollah Khomeini  Oh yeah  He was an exile out of Iran 
[03:02:30]  When the Shah was in there  And he was our right hand man  The Shah  Everyone thought that was going to go fine  For many years  And then all of a sudden he's gone  The Shah comes in  He's the head muckety muck  And we had no say in the matter  Who's to say that wouldn't happen again  And Saddam gets back in power  Find all the judges  All those prosecuting attorneys  And just imagine the bloodshed  Are they really going to  Who's going to kill him?  Whatever wheels of justice they got over there 
[03:03:00]  Oh so it's the Iraqi government  It would be the Iraqi government  But he's just coming across as a very fun guy now  He won't even acknowledge the court by giving his name  They ask him what's your name  He doesn't talk  No he goes you know who I am  Yeah you know who I am  John Wayne swagger  You know who I am  And I know who you are  They asked him eight times  Before they had to tell him  Just sit down  He said  Yeah you know who I am  He said who are you  Who are you  That's exactly what's going on  I want your name Buster  Right 
[03:03:30]  You know he's got a little pad  What's your name  I'm writing this down  How many family members do you have  That I am going to rape and torture  Alright  Why don't we get the girls in here  Gamefly.com as we get the gang  Get everybody in here that needs to come on the show  Yeah he goes first of all  When they asked him what his name was  He goes first of all  Who are you and what are you  What are you  Yeah he wants to know this guy's position  I didn't appoint you  So you obviously aren't  You fucking peasant  Yeah  Think I don't have some mustard gas laying around there buddy 
[03:04:00]  I'm going to lob on you and your fucking hut  The second this shit is over  As soon as this inconvenience is over  Oh if I was that judge  They'd have to reassure me every five seconds  I'd have George Bush on  You're going to kill this guy right  It's fine  It's fine  Everything's fine  We've got freedom  We're staying the course  Staying put in abandoned countries  We're not going to leave  We're going to stay the course  And this action's going to  Are you sure of this  Because he looks very angry at me  What's your name  What do you do  Dug him out of a hole

I hope a lot  Yeah I know  I want to apologize  Well done  Gamefly people  Yeah I think that's cool  $2,500  Jamie's the editor  Of Giant Magazine  I saw the magazine out there  We've seen this  We like Giant Magazine a lot  With love on the cover  Jennifer Love Hewitt  How's she looking?  Um  Ah  Really?  Well  That good  Actually we  When this magazine  Hit our office  We were very excited  Because we like  We like Jennifer Love Hewitt  But I don't know 
[03:10:00]  Um  There's a lot of darkness  In her photos  I was really into  The Jennifer Love Hewitt  Uh  Like um  A party of five years  Yes  Those are the good years  For Jennifer Love Hewitt  Oh when she was 14?  Yeah  Yeah  Problem with that?  She develops  Early  That's like a pedophile  Look at me all defensive  Problem  Pedophile with an attitude  You got a problem?  Yeah so?  I'm taking appreciation  To the next level  You know who  Look she's back  She's got a hit show  Her show's number one  On Friday night 
[03:10:30]  Ghost Whisperer  What was that one she had  That just went right down  Right down the tubes  Right after Party of Five  Oh yeah  She moved to the city  And no one cared  No one gave a shit  Party of Three  Was it a spin-off?  It was a spin-off  Yeah  Party of One  None  Look how cute  Sarah Silverman is  In that picture  Yeah  We ran that  You know her  Before  No  You don't know her?  No  I know who she is  I don't know her  She looks like  She has bad body odor though  Why?  I don't know  Something about it  Something about 
[03:11:00]  When you see her picture  Really?  Yeah  Yeah definitely  The eyebrows are too bushy  You think there's too much  Hair on her body?  I'm not even kidding  I know  She's definitely hot  And she's a very good comic  Yeah she's beautiful  And she goes out  With Jimmy Kimmel  And all that  But when I see her picture  I just get this feeling  That she might smell a little bit  Wow  Is that bad?  Like a patchouli kind of thing  Or are you talking B.O.?  It could be that  It could be B.O.  There's something going on there  That's a bold statement  It's just a feeling I get 
[03:11:30]  When I see her picture  Out of nowhere  Did you see her one time  At a roast  And you hit on her  She was on our show  She shot you down  She was on our show  She was very lovely  Did she smell?  I didn't really smell anything  So what are you basing this on?  Just a feeling I get  Is there an ethnic thing with her?  Because she's Jewish?  I don't know man  There's something going on there though  Seems like she might have a lot of hair  Like you're thinking maybe Hasidic?  And it seems like she's fighting back  A lot of hair all the time  Going through a lot of razors and stuff  Okay  Jennifer Love Hewitt  I'm looking at her picture  Body looks really good  Yeah  But the shots are weird right? 
[03:12:00]  There's something going on  With the grill these days  I don't know what it is  Hmm  Did you get that from just looking at her?  There's something a little drag queen-ish  Yeah it's called maturity Anthony  Is that what it is?  She's a little too mature for you now  She's growing up  She's growing up  Alright let's just still doubt a little bit  Oh I like when they're just  You know  I like when there's still a little baby fat  In the face  Oh yeah  Oh from eating Lucky Charms  No man  She was great  She's great  She's a very sweet girl  Yeah 
[03:12:30]  Have you seen the show?  No  No I haven't  She's so cute  I don't watch sitcoms  I'm sorry  It's an hour long drama  Oh it's a drama  I don't watch drama  I don't watch drama  I don't watch hour long dramas  I don't watch dramas  That insinuates sitcom-y  People often mistake for sitcoms  I'm watching The Apprentice  Because I was forced to  By the big boss  Eric Logan  We'll explain that  One of these days  You were forced  Oh yeah  Completely  I'll admit it on the show  Forced to watch The Apprentice 
[03:13:00]  And make believe I care  And we'll be talking to the next one  That gets kicked off tomorrow  But I have to watch the show  You'll see why  Eventually  And then  I watch Curb Your Enthusiasm  Of course  That's about it  It's great  That's about it  And hockey  You've been getting some complaints about that  This year  Saying it's maybe not as good this season  As it has been before  What do you think?  I think  Better than ever  No I think it's just as good  Ratings are down  A bit  On The Apprentice  And Donald Trump  Was in the paper today  Saying  Blaming it  On Martha Stewart 
[03:13:30]  Blaming it on her version  Of The Apprentice  Saying that it's kind of diluting  Of course  The whole thing  And people are getting too confused  And she's ruining it for him  Same thing happened with Survivor  And the reality was  The reality was  With this reality show  There were a whole bunch  Of other reality shows  That came out  And that's why  The ratings for Survivor  Were diluted  So  Jamie  What do you got going on  In the magazine?  This is  You guys had some  Tribute bands in before  I don't know if you guys saw  The piece we did on the  Even better than the real thing 
[03:14:00]  Very man at you  By the way  Brother Joe  Has the ultimate  U2 tribute band  And the guy  Looks so much more like  Bono  Than the two guys  You featured in the magazine  Really?  What page are you on?  Look at this  I have to disagree with you  But you didn't even see  Brother Joe's band  Page 42  We have a guy named Joe  He's the Los Angeles version  His band's called  Electrical Storm  And Tony Russo  Is the lead singer  Of Unforgettable Fire  They both look exactly  Like Bono  They show you 
[03:14:30]  Oh boy  You're Brother Joe's lead singer  These bands are unbelievable  Oh boy  Did you screw this up  Yeah  I'll be surprised  If you have a job on Monday  So we  Yeah  I'll fire myself  So the  No  There's someone  Are you the head guy  Over there?  Well  One of them  Alright look  So we asked them  What they did for a living  Right  Look at the questions  We asked them all about  You know  Africa  I'm not letting this go  Come here  Come here  I got a mic over here 
[03:15:00]  You tell me that  Brother Joe's lead singer  And his U2 tribute band  Doesn't look just like Bono  Oh my god  See  That's him?  That's him  Now you should have  You said you disagreed  Alright  You know what  I take it back  I take it back  You guys are right  It's your show  Doesn't he look exactly like him?  Be honest  He does dude  He does  But these  Can you imagine the promotion  You would have gotten  If you put  Brother Joe's tribute band  In this magazine  I don't know  What's Brother Joe's band called?  To you  To you  Yeah  Clever  He's playing all over the world 
[03:15:30]  My friend  I like the questions  You did ask them  What do you do for a living?  One produces  Helps produce albums  And one works for  Bristol Myers Squib  Have you ever met  Your local congressman?  Bono  Very active in politics  And everything  Joseph  From  What is that?  Electric Storm?  Electrical Storm  Electrical Storm  Says no  And so does Tony  From Unforgettable  Pumped Fire  Says no  But he did meet  Chuck Schumer  Once at  Coney Island 
[03:16:00]  Irish Festival  Every person  In the New York area  Has met  Chuck Schumer  I like how  The Tony Russo  YouTube guy  You can see  He's totally like  Biting on his molars  Trying to get his jaw  To stick out  A little further  Biting on his molars  So we asked him  What does the World Bank do?  They kind of  Helps  Love this one  The World Bank  Helps countries  Get out of debt  And Tony said  The World Bank  Governs world commerce 
[03:16:30]  It sets the precedent  For the world economy  Sounds good  But it's wrong  I think the  First guy  Was a little closer  And then the  Nelson Mandela  Was imprisoned  In what country?  Yeah  Well  Joseph said  Uganda  It was held by  Idi Amin Dada  Many years ago  And  This other guy  Said just Africa  He wanted to cover  An entire continent  Instead of just  Going for a country 
[03:17:00]  Tony didn't know  It wasn't  Africa's not a country  South Africa  But it's okay  You and Bono  Are at a pub  It's your round  What are you buying?  Joe said  A Coke  No  Actually  A non-carbonated  Room temperature  Spring water  Oof  And Tony says  A Guinness for him  And a Chardonnay  For myself  Little fancy guy there  Yeah  He is quite fancy  Fancy Bono impersonator  Everyone knows  Bono drinks the Guinness  Yeah  Yeah  Mmhmm  Well 
[03:17:30]  Well I think  You dropped the ball there  I think you should have  Got in touch with us  And had that to you  We'll do it next year  We'll do it right next year  Alright  What else is in the magazine there  So we got  Actually on the next page  Is a story we're very proud of  TV Bitch Boys  Bitch Boys  This is pretty funny actually  Always there when you need them  Always there when you don't  Yeah these are  What  Like  Pussies  I  I don't know exactly  You know  I  Yeah these are TV  Pussies  They're 
[03:18:00]  Yeah  They're guys  They're sort of the guys  That were always there  You know  Always there  But not as the man  In the scene  Yeah  Maybe gay  Maybe not  You don't know exactly  Maybe gay  Maybe not  Let me look  Oh we know  We know  No no no  Not Rusty  From the People's Court  Okay no  Rusty was all man  No he was definitely  All man  How does he fit in as a bitch boy  Why is David on  David Spade  David Spade  And just shoot me  He's a total bitch  He was the  You like David Spade  I used to 
[03:18:30]  On Saturday Night Live  As like a  Was it a  Kind of a  A sexual thing  No it was just  He made me laugh  Thing not a sexual thing  And Jim J Bullock  Didn't  No Monroe  Monroe  Come on  Monroe's like  So I'm seeing  Skippy from Family Ties  Was that  Moreau is gay  Yeah Skippy yeah  Any attraction there  No  Monroe looks just like  George Michael to me  A little bit 
[03:19:00]  Without as much stubble  Yeah he's shaving  George Michael adopted  In the Wham  During the Wham years  In the early years  Exactly  And then the black guy  From Designing Women  Who was a real bitch  Did he have any  Friends that were guys  That ever came over  He was the only man  On the show wasn't he  Don Knotts  Yeah  Mr. Furley  On Three's Company  What a fabulous character  That was to watch  Didn't get annoying  Or old  Or anything  You read the 
[03:19:30]  Skip me  Read what it says  Over the Designing Women  As something funny  Read that  Was that supposed  To be funny  Is that supposed  To be funny  Thank God  I only knew  How much he wanted her  No  Is that because  Come on man  There's sex involved  Is that because  You guys are killing me  Is that because  It's a black guy though  And Delta Burke  Had a big ass  No I don't know  I don't know 
[03:20:00]  Because that's the only  Conclusion I'm drawing  Man alive  Yeah it's a rough room  Man  It's a very rough room  Next page  The next page  We went through  A great interview  With Damone  You can't go bad  With Damone  No it was a great interview  We had him on the phone  Damone a little  Disappointing on the phone  Was he  Yeah  He's not bitter  Yeah no  Not at all  I was hoping  For more Damone  And we got  Robert Romanis  We got this guy  Named Robert Romanis  On the phone  We got school teacher  I actually read this man  That was supposed to be  He actually did  Full frontal nudity 
[03:20:30]  Yeah  In that scene  In Fast Times  At Richmond High  And they had to get rid  Of either that  Or the carrot blowjob scene  Yeah  And they opted  To keep the carrot scene  And throw out  I think that's what  Made it a classic  Thank God  If they fucked that decision  If they fucked that decision up  Would have been awful  Straight to video  Damone  Hey Stacy  Love the Damone character  Now you got the attitude  Not so good  The attitude  So  Isn't this great  Yeah 
[03:21:00]  And then we look at the cast of Alf  The cast of Alf  And the father turned out to be  A real fuck up  Yeah what happened with the father  He's a crack addict  And gay porn actor  That's what he's doing now  Yeah  Wow  A porn actor  He was old  Gay porn  Okay  Gay porn  I don't watch gay porn  So  No it's  I mean this is  Look this is  This is how it's reported  You know  Making gay porn while smoking crack  At the same time  So  Of course  He's got a  I think everyone else is doing okay  There's no other way to do gay porn 
[03:21:30]  Willie Tanner  You'd have to be under some issues  God damn  There's been a lot of pole smoking  Thank you DD  Appreciate it  I like the pole  He actually likes the pole  The other feature I think you'd like is  We got the entire cast of  Pretty much the entire cast  19 actors from the Big Lebowski  To talk to us about their experience on the set  And you know  How they all had a lot of fun making this movie  This movie has like gone cult crazy  Yeah  Amazing 
[03:22:00]  The amount of mail we've gotten from this thing  You guys not fans  No  I haven't seen it in a while  I gotta  I gotta watch that again  Yeah I love that movie  It's a great movie  Yeah  Why do you think it's become a cult film  Man it's hard to say with these things  I think a lot of it is the dude  Is the Jeff Bridges character  That guy's an amazing actor  You know  I mean just  He gets sort of  He's sort of underrated I think  He just has great lines  Just every line  Is just quotable  So just guys get together  And just quote it  Anything specific from the movie  That you can remember  We got the whole  Yeah 
[03:22:30]  We got the whole thing about  You know  He's just dancing around  According to the  You know  Big Lebowski  Great lines  Yeah  He said them  And they were  They were great  Sounded like George  Like George Bush  Oh man  We're sending supplies and cash  Oh  Yeah  And also you do a whole thing  On the 25 scariest DVDs ever  Yes  You know  The Halloween season is upon us  It's your agenda for Halloween night  So this is perfect  Yeah  And you know  They're scary  And there's nice  Should we give away number one 
[03:23:00]  So no one has to buy the magazine  Or  Or that would be a bad thing  Gee  No no no  Let's tell them  Let's tell them  I mean  Do you guys agree with these  Texas Chainsaw Massacre  Number one  The original  I don't know  Not the Michael Bay remake  The scariest movie of all time  I don't  No  No  You know  There's a difference between  Blood and guts kind of movie  And scary  Yeah  I could be scared  I'll give you the definition of scary movie  The ring 
[03:23:30]  Yeah  Creepy shit  Freak me out  You're not seeing any blood and guts in that movie  But  Just the creepiest visual things in there  Yeah did the ring make the list  Did the ring make the list my friend  If it didn't  You will have to leave  You're gonna have to go back to the lab  Because that  Here's why the ring didn't make it  Not old enough  No no no  We did  Three issues before we did  Asian horror  A whole Asian horror round up  And it was number one  So we just done  We just did a huge thing on it  Asian horror round up 
[03:24:00]  How did Phantasm  Get in at 20  Is that the one with the little sphere  That would fly  And the screw would come up  It's the little orb  With the pitchfork in the front  And the Shining is 17  The Shining is 17  See you're a psychological guy  Like you need the  You know  That's  For you horror is psychological  Like  Those little twin girls  Flashing in the picture  I know  Horrifying  That's more scary than the birds  My friend  Yeah  Birds pretty creepy  Birds creepy  But Silence of the Lambs  The Shining was scarier than the fly 
[03:24:30]  Which you got at number 7  Night of the Living Dead  Very good  Yep  Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer  That's a great one  That's scary  The one I want to  I want to like  My favorite of all of these  Is actually 15  Is the Cube  I don't know if you guys ever saw that  Oh yeah  Phenomenal  I like the Cube  Phenomenal movie  Yeah that was pretty good  That was more  Yeah more your speed  My speed too  The photo shoot afterwards  Is great  The lost girl  Does it put her in sexy clothes  But you can tell  That she's completely uncomfortable  In every photo

[03:27:00]  Like 15 years later  Whatever it's been  The fucking puppet  Is the one that's actually  Doing the best  Out of  The whole cast  Yeah  Just an observation  Very good  Alright so we got  Jamie hanging out  Giant magazine  We really do like  The magazine  We beat you guys up a lot  I know  I love it though  But I  And I got Bill  To bust my ass as well  I love it  I get every issue  I think it's  I read this thing  On the way to Seattle  Yeah  Michael Rappaport  Very dangerous look

[03:28:00]  You two  As my mic falls  It's not just going to be  You two  And a cock  Like  And things going on  Unless of course  There would be like  A rooster in this studio  Which would be funny  Two chicks and a cock  And then you talk  Hi it's my chicken  You know  Two chicks and a double dong  Would work  There you go  Yeah  But it's two chicks  And a dick  Who's the dick  Well  We have a contest  For that  You want to find  A dick  I certainly have  The perfect dick  For your listeners 
[03:28:30]  And you never really  Find one  It's just you two  You two doing a show  And then the gag is  You're looking for dick  No we're going to find one  We're going to pick one  It's not like you're looking  For your news girl  I'll never pick her  Oh  The jig's up  Everyone finally realized  We never really were looking  For a news chick  I've got to move the mic  Okay  Yeah  Yes  So you got some samples  You brought in  Yeah I do  Of what  The show  Yeah  It's on the internet  You two actually

[03:29:30]  No we didn't change the name  How about changing the name  To two chicks  Plus another chick  That's excellent  Two chicks and a chick  That's good  It's kind of like  Stevie Ray Vaughan  In Double Trouble  When they added the keyboard  And they still said  Double Trouble  That's his double  But you guys heard  The Opie and Anthony show  And Jim Norton's always here  But he's not in the title  In your face  Because he's not here enough  To be in the title  In your face  That's a good point  But he's not here enough  To be in the title  But he was  He's a big star in Hollywood  He certainly is  And we knew it the whole time  That's why we never put his name  In the title  We knew he was leaving us 
[03:30:00]  Eventually  He's coming back  Isn't he  So Deedee  You're a permanent fixture though  I just want to start the rumor  Watch the board now  Permanent fixture  So Deedee  And what  How would you describe  How would you pitch this show  I need  I need a quick  Couple of sentences  A paragraph  On what this show is about  It's Loveline meets Wild On  There you go  Loveline  Which is like the  You know  Sex talk thing  Hi you call in  Hi I'm having trouble  Blah blah blah  Meets Wild On 
[03:30:30]  Which is Tara Dice  Without Tara Reid  It's with Brooke Burke  Right  Brooke Burke  Very good  So I don't know  How do those mix  Do you go places  Actually yes  You go places  And you talk about  Sex  When you're out  At a bar  We talk about  Numerous topics  They don't go places  Go places  They go places  With their show  Right  Right  What do you mean  Thank you  You said  You go places  And she said yes  Meaning she'll go down  Some roads 
[03:31:00]  And some  Different topics  Oh  She doesn't actually  Leave the premises  When she said yes  So how is it like  Wild On  It's nothing like  Wild On  No but we do  I'll let you  Your show stinks  No it doesn't  We do  We'll do shows  It's like Loveline  Meets a show that stinks  You know what  It is so refreshing  To be on this side  Of the pitch  Of a bad pitch  Now we know exactly  What they felt like  At A&E  So how's the weather outside  There's like a place  Like for instance  Using this as an example  Up for an instance
