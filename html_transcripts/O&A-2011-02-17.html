<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Jim Norton recounting a bizarre and sexually suggestive yoga class experience, detailing the instructor's aggressive physical adjustments, including unwanted touching.  The hosts responded with sexually explicit jokes and commentary, further fueled by listener calls about flatulence and other bodily functions in yoga class.  The conversation then shifted to a news report about a journalist assaulted in Bahrain, leading to discussions about journalistic ethics, the risks faced by reporters (especially women), and recent political uprisings globally.  This tangent included digressions on Muammar Gaddafi's age,  outlandish women's hats, and a heated argument with a caller whose parents owned fur coats. The segment concluded with a discussion of IBM's Watson winning Jeopardy and donating its winnings to charity.

The show continued with a debate on the use of offensive language, specifically the N-word and "faggot,"  with the hosts arguing that context determines the offensiveness of these words. The discussion then moved to the ethics of purchasing stingray skin products and animal treatment, particularly concerning dolphins in captivity. Opie shared a negative experience with dolphins on a cruise.  The hosts then expressed relief at the absence of a scheduled studio guest, before previewing their upcoming guests: Triple H (positively) and William H. Macy (with planned sarcastic interview tactics focused on *The House of Games*).  This segment also featured discussions of a Twitter interaction with a user celebrating sobriety, a nude photo offer for a retweet, a critique of a "Don't Say Gay" PSA, and the double standard in language policing based on target race or ethnicity. Finally, they expressed embarrassment over a White Castle wedding hosted by their old station, XRK, contrasting it with their own show's content.  The segment concluded with a Norm Macdonald bit and a new recurring bit featuring Bobby Kelly as "Billy the Bassman."  A Joe Rogan YouTube video on the word "faggot" was also briefly mentioned.

A subsequent segment began with a video of a crackhead performing a dangerous backflip.  This transitioned into a conversation with Jim Norton, who was expressing anxiety and uncertainty about his career path, following recent success.  Norton discussed feeling overwhelmed,  a stressful heart test, and an awkward encounter with Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas.  A caller, Kathy, offered him support.  The conversation covered career challenges, comparing the experiences of other comedians like Louie C.K. and Dane Cook, and included another mention of a Joe Rogan podcast clip about language use.  A Michigan news reporter getting tased and a story about Senator Scott Brown were also briefly discussed.  The segment ended with further discussion of Norton's anxieties and the hosts' own feelings about their show's future, all laced with frequent offensive language.

The final segment focused on Joe Rogan's decision to limit his use of "faggot" and "nigger" in his stand-up. The hosts debated the appropriateness of self-censorship, with differing viewpoints on whether comedians should avoid causing offense.  This discussion included extensive use of offensive language including "cunt" and "pussy," and various homophobic and racist slurs.  Later, they discussed listener emails and tweets, a subway commercial featuring Ari, and a Sean Lennon song clip leading to discussion about Moby and Sean Lennon's talent.  A significant portion of the segment centered on Opie's short-lived online feud with Rosie O'Donnell, characterized by offensive tweets and speculation about her appearance. The segment concluded with the hosts joking about escaping the studio to avoid Rosie O'Donnell.  There were no in-studio guests during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  Funny.  Morning.  Wow.  Opie.  Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  How's everyone?  Hi.  Ready to broadcast?  I don't know.  Ready to broadcast.  I woke up, I can't remember a time of not wanting to get out of bed more.  Like, I just physically.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Yeah, one of those days.  Just wanted to stay in bed. 
[00:01:30]  God damn, my time.  You gotta, you gotta do some of that yoga.  I like yoga, but it's just too, too, uh, hard.  I was telling Anthony, I was doing yoga last night, and man, I don't, I don't know what  the hell's going on with this yoga.  Within, like, 15 minutes, the instructor is basically grabbing my balls to get me in  position.  Get me in the proper position.  For one of the poses.  She, she was.  Oh, she was.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to think like it's a guy.  She was.  Grabbing your leg.  I don't even know if there's a guy yoga instructor out there. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, I bet there are.  I'd probably prefer a male, actually, because a woman would be hard not to stare at.  You prefer a male?  I think, because a woman, I've done, like, private yoga.  Because you're gay?  No, no, no, no.  Because then, it's hard not to look.  But if it's a, if it's a male instructor, then you have no, no real excuse.  You're doing, you're doing yoga with a male instructor.  Yeah.  At least you can tell people, oh, you're going to see the girl in her yoga pants.  Well, that's true, yeah.  Because it's uncomfortable for me to even tell anyone that I do yoga. 
[00:02:30]  Really?  But then, you know, you got the instructor grabbing your balls to get you in the proper  position.  Now, I'm not so uncomfortable.  I want to come in here and brag.  Yoga pants.  There they are.  Dude, the yoga pants is the greatest invention ever.  Yoga pants.  I did bed in a couple of times.  It's hard, man.  It makes me sleep like a baby.  And then, last night, they had some fucking belt S&M position that we all had to do.  What time do you take it?  8.30.  So, I go at 8.30.  But it doesn't happen to keep you awake?  Fuck no, man.  I almost got hit by a car on the way home yesterday. 
[00:03:00]  I was so in la-la land.  8.30 to 9.30?  8.30 to 9.30.  For some reason, I feel so relaxed that I need to walk in the middle of the street.  That's what I was doing last night.  I was a fucking zombie.  And then I go home and I crash right away.  And I sleep like a baby.  Do you shower after or no?  Hell fucking no.  And I was sweating like a pig yesterday.  Grunting.  And then this belt S&M position, man.  What the...  I don't know what the hell's going on.  I highly recommend everyone go do yoga.  Yeah.  It's good for you.  You got the fucking instructor grabbing your balls. 
[00:03:30]  Because you got to get your groin back.  What is that?  What?  Like, why was she grabbing your balls?  Like, what was...  Obviously exaggerating.  But, I mean, there's fucking...  The hand was way the fuck up on the thigh.  Up on the thigh?  Yeah.  To put you in a position?  Yeah.  Pulling me back.  Pulling you back.  At one point, I think she was dry-humping me from behind.  Because I was in, I think, something...  I don't know.  I think it was called Downward Facing Dog or something.  Sure.  And then she...  Sure.  And then she decided she needed to go behind me with her hands. 
[00:04:00]  And her breasts were up against my back.  And she was pulling my whole body up toward the ceiling.  What is that about?  I don't know.  But, man, I'm fucking all in.  Can't they just tell you?  Yeah, they tell you.  But if you're smart like me, you might not want to get yourself in position.  I can't figure this out.  I can't figure this out.  Could you help me?  So, next thing, I got a ball grab.  Her warm boobs are on my back.  So, that's the position you were in? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, on your hands and feet?  Yeah, yeah.  Bent in an L with your ass sticking way up in the air?  I think that was a mod of...  You know what?  I guess it was in that position then.  I'm trying to think which one it was where she was dry-humping me.  How many people in your class?  Three.  Wow.  Three?  Is that including you?  Three.  Well, then the instructor.  So, four of us.  Four of us.  And then there was some kind of belt thing.  Just imagine taking your belt.  You put it on regular, but before you buckle it, now take the two straps and put it between 
[00:05:00]  your...  If you can find this position, I'll be amazed, because I think this is an illegal position.  And then you put the straps between your legs, and then the hot instructor is pulling  the straps from behind to lift you up in the air.  It's like SNF shit.  What are you doing, like...  Are you on your hands and feet?  Depending on the position.  That particular one, yeah.  That was more like the dog position.  But now you really want to get a nice lift.  You want to open up the area, the groin area, so you can breathe.  Open up the groin area? 
[00:05:30]  What is that?  I'm in fucking heaven right now, man.  I'm trying to figure this out.  Yeah, that I wouldn't want to ask for, by the way.  That's why there's no fucking way I want a male instructor.  No, no, I'm only...  I have no problem looking at the little...  The little...  In the yoga pants.  Oh, the camel toe?  And getting my groin almost padded.  See, I didn't have that when I went.  Oh, and I did that position, too, whatever the fuck that is, where you grab your own toes  while you're kind of on the ground in almost a split position.  With the belt? 
[00:06:00]  How far from us is it?  Not your belt.  Oh, that's close.  So you walk.  You know the place?  It's close.  Hey, are there other guys in there?  Don't fucking go to my class and ruin it, Jimmy.  No, I can't do that right away.  I can't go at 8.30 at night anyway.  Just me and a bunch of girls.  Are they all girls?  Other girls, okay.  Don't ruin it for me.  I don't want to see you in there.  In my yoga pants?  Like Fight Club, you've got to choose which days you want to attend.  I think I'm going to start showering.  Monday and Thursday.  I think I'm going to start showering before I go, because I went with my sweaty sweatpants. 
[00:06:30]  Oh.  And she was behind me a lot.  I'm like, man.  Oh, shit.  She might have gotten a sniff.  At 8.30 at night, that can't be a good position to be in, I'm thinking.  A little crankiness?  A little crankiness.  But from now on, I'm going to shower.  Maybe put a little cologne on.  Oh, God.  Come in a suit.  A little high karate.  But then you pair off.  Next thing you know, you're touching some other girl in areas that you probably would do maybe after having a few drinks. 
[00:07:00]  This sounds like fucking HBO's Real Sex.  I don't know, man.  That yoga world, there's some touchy-feely stuff going on.  Yeah.  I'm here to report back from the field.  I don't think I'm very comfortable with that.  You should try it one time.  No.  Try one time.  No.  That's good for you.  I'll just stick to the trainer.  Well, I've got a really bad lower back.  He stands there and tells me what to do.  No touching.  I've got a really bad lower back because, you know, logically, it made sense to carry 100 pounds of golf bags when you're 12 years old and you're still developing. 
[00:07:30]  Thanks, Mom.  I can do it.  Huh?  Yeah, I was that guy.  But then fast forward a couple decades, and guess what?  I have a fucking really bad back.  Oy.  It's helping the lower back.  Damn.  I hope that you sleep so well because the instructor makes it.  Fuck you, Brent.  Cumzies?  Yeah.  Hey, Brent.  Yeah?  Hey, man.  Hey, I was just wondering if the instructor made you make the cumzies in your pants, and that's why you slept so good when you got home. 
[00:08:00]  God.  I'm trying to think if I was close to a boner.  I'll be honest.  Let me think.  Were you at any time close to a boner?  No.  No.  No?  I can control the boner.  Because you were working.  I can certainly control the boner.  Yeah.  You're working.  Yeah, because you're focusing on stuff.  If it got to the point where, you know, she looked into your eyes and just grabbed your ball bag.  This is yoga.  See, yoga's for queers.  See, that's why I didn't want to bring this up.  Yoga.  Because we have a very close-minded audience. 
[00:08:30]  Extremely close-minded.  Maybe they need a belt wrapped around their head to open their head.  Yeah, exactly.  Open their mind.  Like the groin.  We'll put some space in their fucking skulls so they can breathe properly.  Jimmy does the yoga.  I don't.  I wish I did more.  I went to Bickham a couple times, and it's an amazing fucking feeling, but it's an hour  and a half class.  It was just too much to get through.  Like I literally would, I was afraid I wasn't going to make it through the class twice.  Yeah, it's just like 100 and something degrees in there.  It's really hot.  Hot yoga.  Dude, it's tough, man. 
[00:09:00]  Hot yoga.  I've been a workout guy my entire life.  I still lift at the gym a couple days a week, and I'm on my bike when it's warm.  I'm on the treadmills and all that shit.  And I'm telling you, I told Anthony this morning, holy shit.  I've never worked so hard in my life.  I was sweating like a pig, and all you're doing is going in positions.  Women with yoga bodies are fucking sexy.  Nothing is sexy.  Because it lengthens your arms.  They have those long, like slender, but really, really fucking nicely muscled arms. 
[00:09:30]  Long and slender.  Long and slender.  Yeah.  Yes.  And that's, wow.  And I almost got hit by a car because I'm in a meditated state.  And the one week, I fell down the stairs.  Yeah, that's right.  Okay.  You fell down the stairs.  With a broken foot.  Oh, yeah.  I almost got hit by a car.  Oh, my God.  Which I think the x-ray didn't capture the fracture because I haven't talked about it.  My fucking little toe still is on fire.  So it has to be broken.  Those things take forever.  Yeah.  Like years later, it'll still hurt.  But that's when I slipped like a banana peel on the marble steps and caught my foot in the railing after yoga class. 
[00:10:00]  And then pretty much, in my opinion, it might as well have been broken.  I've just realized over time, you reach a point in your life where things are just going to hurt.  Oh, really?  For no fucking reason.  Oh, man.  I don't want to accept that yet.  It's just it.  I don't want to accept that yet, but you're right.  All right.  You know something?  My fucking elbow hurts because I fucking I wailed it when I slipped on the ice three years ago. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, that still hurts?  Oh, yeah.  Right there.  Right there.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You chipped it.  I can feel it.  You chipped your elbow.  You know that, right?  I must have chipped it or something.  If it still hurts.  What's that?  If it still hurts, you certainly did something there.  But it's like, you know what?  No one's going to do anything about it.  And it's like, oh, it hurts?  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Deal with it.  It's like Louis C.K.'s bit.  When he goes to the doctor and he just tells you things that, yeah, well, you know, that's just the way it is.  You're cosmetically overweight. 
[00:11:00]  It's like, why did you have to tell me that then?  I've never heard.  Well, I've heard this so many times, I should, I guess, put it this way in the last few years.  Yeah, that's a wear and tear injury, you guys.  Wear and tear.  What does that mean?  You've just been living, you know, long enough that you now get wear and tear injuries.  Wear and tear.  I almost had to have a fucking shoulder operation.  It was a wear and tear thing.  Yeah.  I didn't do anything.  It was just from all my years of playing sports, wear and tear.  Lower back, wear and tear. 
[00:11:30]  That's it.  I'm trying to think.  There was another one, whatever.  But I've heard it like three times.  The, uh, when, when I, when I work out, it's, uh, it feels better.  Yeah.  It actually does.  It feels better.  Yeah, absolutely.  If you just, if you just sit there and do nothing, then you're just like, ow, ow.  But, you know, you move around, you lift some shit.  Let's go to Brett in Rochester.  Brett.  Hey, how you guys doing this morning?  Pretty good, Brett.  Um, so I've had a couple friends who've done yoga and they've always said that they are constantly,  like, farting, like, the entire time. 
[00:12:00]  I've heard that too, actually.  I, uh, I, I let one out yesterday.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Do you know when they knew who it was?  When you're opening up space, man.  It's called opening up space in the groin area.  Guess what?  That sounds so new age.  What's opening up space in the groin area?  I don't know.  I don't know what that is.  Honestly, I don't even know.  Half the time, I'm like, is this even doing anything?  They're talking about opening up space and, and, and taking your breath to the back, to  the back of your body.  I'm like, what the fuck does that mean? 
[00:12:30]  I'm like, when you breathe, you're just breathing.  It's going into your lungs.  How do you bring the breath to the back of your body and then make it come all the way  down into the groin area?  So I'm just sitting there going, I hope some of this is working and doing something.  You fucking got lungs in your balls?  I don't know.  What the fuck is that?  But I did fart, and if you do yoga, it's just accepted, man.  But it's really brutal.  Does the room just stink?  No, because it's more just, uh, nah.  No?  Any other chicks?  I was going to say, because it's more like air, but every fart's air, I guess, but. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, yeah, you get a chick just farting.  You get a chick blasting out as well.  Oh, God.  Tee-hee.  Do they put their hand by their mouth and go, Tee-hee.  They hold a hanky over their mouth.  Oh, for sure.  For sure.  I imagine half of it probably has to do with, like, you know, not eating, like, shit half the  time before you go in.  Oh, check out the big brain on, Brett.  Thank you, Brett.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mikey.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Yo, have you seen that movie, Forgetting Sarah Marshall?  Yeah, of course.  All right, Kate, hold on, hold on.  There's no reason for that. 
[00:13:30]  See, for the people that think I'm exaggerating.  There's no reason for that.  This is what the instructor.  All right.  Come on.  Come on.  Well, hold on, hold on.  We'll get to you in a sec, Mike.  Yeah, sure.  There's, uh, Danny found a Google image of, uh, a bunch of really, really, I don't know if  they're hot, but their bodies certainly are, girls doing yoga, and the instructor, who's  kind of slobby, has his hands right over their crotches as, as their, how do you explain  this pose?  They are fucking-  Trying to suck their own dicks.  Yeah, they're trying to suck their own clits.  Yeah, imagine that. 
[00:14:00]  And the instructor has, uh, his hands on two girls at the same time, right over their crotch,  trying to push them down further.  Right on their crotch.  Yeah, there's no, no need for that, I would say.  That's what I'm telling you, though.  There's, like, no, there's no boundaries for some reason, because you gotta get the, you  gotta get these people in the proper yoga positions.  No boundaries, right.  There's really no boundaries.  Touching and pulling and fucking rubbing.  Mike in Jersey, what's up, Mike?  Mike?  Yo, were you, uh, were you the guy out of the snow, or were you the ex-fucking-shit the  whole time?  Like, yeah, motherfucker, I got this shit. 
[00:14:30]  From, uh, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I'm trying to, I don't remember the scene.  Oh, come on.  You gotta remember, when he, uh, he wakes up, he's, like, half drunk, and he's trying to do,  like, you know, the yoga poses, and the instructor's like, well, you can just sit Indian style,  it's okay, and he's, like, doing a handstand, he's talking shit.  I'll have to check out the movie again, I'm really sorry.  It's probably a great reference, I just don't remember the movie, I guess.  Yeah, none of us are going, like, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Ah, shit, never mind.  I don't even know if it's a bomb, it's probably a great reference that I just don't...  Oh, you gotta check it out, dude.  The freaking, all the snow is doing, like, these regular poses, and the freaking instructor's 
[00:15:00]  like, yeah, you're doing great, let me just lay on you, and, okay, let me just  feel you, oh, you're so, oh, what a good day.  Why?  Yeah.  All right, man, thank you.  Let's go to Andrew in Virginia.  Andrew.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Opie, I was just wondering, I was just wondering in your classes, if you ever hear  any of the girls slipping any queefs out.  Yeah, you know what, I heard that some queefing could happen.  I've heard a fart.  Well, maybe that was a queef, I don't know.  I've heard a fart or two, but, yeah, the queefing happens, too. 
[00:15:30]  A fart or two?  Well, you bring an air into your groin area.  Well, you gotta.  Apparently, you have to.  I don't know what that's all about.  Jimmy would probably be all up in there smelling that shit and loving it, right, Jimmy?  No, I'm sorry, I don't like queefs.  Jimmy's like, no.  I don't know.  I don't know what it does, but I don't know if I'm doing it properly.  I have no fucking idea.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's, um...  I just get to chill, and...  That's such a weird, new-agey, touchy thing.  I don't know. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know if it's new-agey.  It's been around since, like, the dawn of time.  Oh, yeah, no, no, I realize that, but it's kind of a new-age thing to do, like...  The only thing I don't get into is you have to do some oms.  I joke about it on the show, but...  Yeah, that's new-agey.  But the problem is, I've been in classes where there's so many people that you don't ome and  no one knows, this class is so small that she's looking at you like, where's your ome?  You're not omen.  I'm like, fuck, I'm omen.  I didn't get a harumph out of you.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm like, I'm omen.  So I'm like...  As low as possible. 
[00:16:30]  All right, well, that was my night, whatever.  How was everyone else's night?  Good.  I couldn't imagine, like, working out that late, though.  Like, in any way, shape, or form.  Oh, no, if I was on my bike or if I was lifting, no way, because then you're so hyper, you're  not going to sleep.  But for some reason, I don't know, because it is a workout, technically.  I don't know, but it just fucking knocks me the fuck out.  Because I have to, like, eat afterwards, and if it was late, I couldn't do that. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know how you don't have somebody come to you and then just crash, like, before they're  in the elevator.  You could have someone come and give you...  See, that's where me and you are different.  I need to get the fuck out of my apartment.  Oh, I love locking.  I love being sequestered.  Jimmy, you like just being in the apartment, going down to the gym and stuff.  I got to get air.  Yeah.  I hate the fact that I don't have outdoor space.  I fucking hate it.  You know?  Because I'm way up in the sky, and just to get air, it's a hassle.  Wait for an elevator to go down, go outside, blah, blah, blah.  But I need to get the fuck out. 
[00:17:30]  No, I like leaving, too, but I'm just lazy.  It's like, I know if someone's coming, I'm okay.  Right.  But I would never do it.  Like, I would say, ah, I'm going to go.  Like, Bikram, I just...  That's exactly why I have somebody come to me.  I don't trust myself.  Yeah, it makes sense.  I just need to get the fuck out.  I wander the neighborhood all the fucking time.  Yeah?  Just wander.  Wandering?  I mean, never walk around.  I do loops.  It's called loops.  I go to my girl, I go, hey, I'm going to go do a loop.  She knows.  She knows my loop.  You just walk around?  Yeah, go and get a juice, walk Columbus Avenue a little bit, maybe get a Starbucks. 
[00:18:00]  But it's cold.  It's not cold.  Not today.  No.  It's been fucking freezing.  Bundle up.  No.  No.  Bundle up.  I just have to hit the thermostat and throw a few logs in the fireplace.  You guys...  It's great.  You don't know cold until you live in Buffalo, man.  I'm telling you.  This is like spring to me.  No, I don't like any cold.  Buffalo was cold.  Yeah, I...  And it gets colder than Buffalo.  That's crazy cold.  That fucking place is hell on earth.  And I know hell is supposed to be warm, but that fucking place... 
[00:18:30]  It's insane cold.  You know, if you're listening to us in Buffalo, get the fuck out.  What are you doing?  Your family's not that important.  They'll come see you.  Move.  Go somewhere warm, and guess what?  They'll come and see you a lot.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out.  I could not imagine.  The people are nice up there, but it's not worth it.  Jesus Christ.  Dude, when I was up there, it was single digits day after day after day.  It was unbelievable.  That's cold.  That's got to be depressing. 
[00:19:00]  It gets to you, I think.  It's like, oh, God.  It absolutely gets to you.  But down here, man, it was what?  30 degrees yesterday.  That's easy.  Oh, yeah.  Yesterday wasn't bad.  Something like that.  Today's really going to be...  Yeah, today will be in the 40s, and then tomorrow it's going to be 65.  Yeah.  It's going to be spring tomorrow for a day.  Nice.  And then Saturday, the temperatures are going to drop down, so everyone's going to get  their colds.  Yeah, you get your warm, cold, cold.  But they try to tell you that the colds have nothing to do with cold weather. 
[00:19:30]  Well, you know what?  It's going to be just a toasty 73.  Why don't we get colds in the summer, then?  Doctors and everybody will tell you it has nothing to do with the weather.  Then why does everyone get sick in the fucking winter and not in the summer?  I think it's your resistance.  What do you mean?  I think your resistance goes down when it's cold, and you're more apt to not be able  to fight it off.  I think.  See this, assholes.  Yoga strengthens your spine.  Good for old guys. 
[00:20:00]  Jesus.  Fucking asshole.  We got another reporter that was attacked.  Yeah, I heard this on the news on the way in today.  Another one?  And I'm exhausted trying to, like, debate dummies.  I'm just exhausted.  Not going to debate with you.  Fucking yesterday, we talked about Lara Logan.  And this guy writes me overnight and says that, well, how else are you going to get your news  if the reporters don't go to these places?  That's not the point we made yesterday.  The point is that they're all taking extreme chances to be kind of rock stars and the big 
[00:20:30]  stars on their networks and stuff.  To be in there.  And finally, someone got spanked, and it's horrible that it happened to her, and it shouldn't  have happened to her.  But that's what I was trying to say.  Like, even Anderson Cooper, when he got a few blows to the head, he realized, and he  started reporting from a roof.  I'm not saying that we're not going to get our news anymore, but these people got to be  smart.  You don't have to be.  That's the point we're making.  In the middle of a group of fucking savages to get the news.  I feel bad, but I'm not surprised. 
[00:21:00]  And, you know, guess what?  Like, it almost, you almost have to say, it serves you right, dummy.  Yeah.  You see these fucking hurricane people, eventually one of these hurricane people is going to  be swept away.  And then what?  We're all going to have to be sad and stuff?  Fuck that.  They're the ones taking their chances for ratings and their bosses and all, and the rest.  Right.  Because you don't need it to get the story.  You've got a blonde in the middle of, in the middle of that craziness.  And you couldn't say.  And it sounds like she didn't have real security like Ann was saying.  Oh, she didn't.  A couple cameramen that might have taken a taekwondo class once in their life. 
[00:21:30]  And you couldn't say, you can't go there, you're a woman.  You can't say that.  I'm not even saying that.  No, no, no.  I'm saying if her boss said that, they'd get in trouble for going, well, what do you  mean, I can't go there because I'm a woman?  It's like, the woman should not be allowed to stand in the middle of that square.  Nope.  But the bosses can't say that.  Yeah.  Or else you get to.  Yeah.  Hostile work environment.  Yeah.  Right.  But, you know, I mean, the bosses should be in trouble for this one. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  They'll probably, like, kind of put the pressure on.  Look, you guys are going over.  No, she wanted to go back.  She came home.  She was sent back from Egypt.  She was arrested.  Right.  A while ago.  And they fucking, like, put them in a weird thing overnight.  It's a nightmare there.  Right.  And she went back.  But the point to the dummy, and I don't even want to give you attention today.  I didn't.  He goes, well, how else are we going to get our news?  That's not.  We weren't saying that.  You could get the same.  They could have got the same pictures, for the most part, and the same story from a roof  or a safer place.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  They don't have to be in the middle of a fucking hostile crowd.  Right.  I love it.  Is this the clip where the guy's like, a journalist, journalist?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think so.  Like, they give a shit.  They don't care.  They don't care.  They'll beat the fuck out of you anyway.  They don't want you there.  I love when you see the local guys on the street.  And then if you're walking there, they're shouting, hey, we're news people trying to do  What are you doing, really?  Shut up.  They're going to get their ass handed to them.  This isn't.  And they think it's the same as Egypt, no matter where they go.  And Egypt was bad, too, obviously. 
[00:23:00]  You know, they're raping.  But you think Bahrain is handling it the same way?  No.  Or Libya or Iran?  No.  I don't think so.  They're fucking, they're shooting people.  They're beating the fuck out of people.  They don't want an Egypt situation.  No, I was thinking on the way in, most of these places missed their opportunity.  They should have all done it at the same time.  Yeah.  Because the rest of the governments are like, they got it easy.  They don't want you overthrowing them. 
[00:23:30]  And they saw what happened in Egypt.  They saw it.  And they're like, you know what?  We know how to handle this.  We just watched how, watched all the mistakes that Mubarak just did.  Fuck that.  Don't let them get enough traction to where the media starts showing the people.  Yeah.  And there's an outcry for the government not to hurt them.  Yeah.  So you got to, the second they step out of the street, the second you see five people  in one place with a sign, you got to beat the piss out of them as a dictator and just 
[00:24:00]  start squirting with hoses.  You're going to see, you're going to see a couple more of the governments go away.  Here's one.  Unrested presidents, Bahrain cracks down on protesters.  Yeah.  They're shooting tear gas into the crowd.  Oh yeah, they're not fucking around.  They're beating the fuck out of them with big clubs.  You're going to see a few more of these governments go down, but in general, you're  not going to see that sweeping change like happened in Egypt.  No.  Yemen, same thing.  What, the Yemen people want their cushy lives to go away?  Fuck that.  Nope. 
[00:24:30]  That's it.  All right.  Well, here's the ABC news reporter, Miguel, uh, Marquez, something like that.  Yeah.  There are whole gangs of police officers moving in a line to clear the square forcefully.  Clearly, the military's not taking any more of the protesters are now starting to move back  toward the military, and they are in a complete fight right on the street. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, there was a canister that looked like, uh, now the police officers are changing me.  No, no, no, no.  Press press media.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  No, no, no.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists. 
[00:25:30]  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  Journalists.  I'm going, I'm going.  My son is here.  I'm going, I'm going.  I'm going.  I'm going.  Pussy.  Yeah, and that's it.  He deserves it. 
[00:26:00]  And, well, I don't know if you want to say he deserves it, but I've, you know.  I think at this point, there's a better way to do it than can be on the roof.  People get really mad when you say they deserve it because no one deserves to be sexually assaulted.  But, I mean, what are you doing?  Especially by yelling journalists.  That's the dumbest thing to yell because they're aware that the journalists are helping get the message out there.  Dude, Al Jazeera fucking got closed down in Egypt.  Yeah.  Al Jazeera.  Right.  If they fucked with Al Jazeera, why are you sending a blonde woman down there? 
[00:26:30]  Where was this happening?  Egypt as well?  This is, no, Bahrain.  Bahrain, okay.  Bahrain.  Bahrain.  I don't know why they hate the reporters so much because I can see why Mubarak's supporters hated the reporters.  Yeah.  But it's like, that's getting the world aware of your plight.  Like, what are you doing, dummies?  Could have been government people.  Maybe, yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, then Miguel explains what just happened.  I'm sorry.  I'm now in a marketplace in our hotel.  My shoes fell off. 
[00:27:00]  Where people are cowering in buildings.  I mean, these people are not screwing around.  They are going to clear that square tonight ahead of any protests on Friday.  The government clearly does not want this to get any bigger.  If Bahrain goes, there are fears that Saudi Arabia could face greater problems.  The regime here is really laying down the line saying it stops tonight.  Oh, shit. 
[00:27:30]  You never want to hear that.  No.  It stops tonight.  They beat me all over my head, chest, and my ass neck.  Oh, I was very injured, but my feelings were hurt.  They fired tear gas, and my shoes fell off, and my glasses.  I went up to the top of the roof of the hotel, and I can't see so good. 
[00:28:00]  Fucking God.  You're a journalist.  You just see what a pussy turned into also.  Of course, we'd probably all sound like that, but you never want it on tape.  No.  You never want to hear you begging like, ah, no, journalists.  Yeah, I mean, the journalists, they've been taking some pretty big chances in the last few years.  Yeah.  Now they're kind of getting beat up a little bit. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, now they're getting roughed up.  Right.  You know, they've been able to walk around with that press thing.  I like the guys in Iraq or in Afghanistan.  They've got the Kevlar on with the big press in front of it.  Oh, yeah, they won't shoot at you.  Yeah, right.  You've got that press thing on.  Libya's looking bad, huh?  Violent protests in Libya.  Yeah, it's another one.  And Gaddafi's still in charge down there.  And then some people, Gaddafi puppets of the U.S. will fail.  Oh, see, he's thinking the protesters are puppets of the U.S. 
[00:29:00]  Boy, isn't that amazing that he was like the bad guy when Reagan was in office.  And he's still there.  And he's still there.  He's doing something right because he looks great.  How old is he now?  I know.  It's like, what the fuck?  He's got a dark, full head of hair.  He's got a mustache.  Surrounded by women.  They're his bodyguards.  People are bodyguards.  Yeah, it's like crazy.  The guy was around when fucking, you know, Thatcher and Reagan were.  What, was he 20 back then?  Yeah, he must have been like the little upstart.  The young upstart. 
[00:29:30]  How old is Gaddafi?  I really want to know.  Because we remember him from way back.  Probably in his late 60s, early 70s.  That's it?  I would think, right?  Come on, Reagan would have been 100 this year.  He would have been 100 years old.  He was a lot older.  Maybe Gaddafi had to be.  He was a lot older.  I hope Gaddafi's killed.  That would be a nice fucking thing.  Gaddafi was born in 1969.  He's 68.  He's 68 years old?  Born in 42.  42?  What?  I was joking, 69. 
[00:30:00]  I thought it was coming out on feedback or something.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, what?  Of course he wasn't born in 69.  Wait a minute.  He's 60.  68.  Born in 42?  Born in 42.  Yeah, he'll be 69 this year.  So he was in his 30s and shit.  Reagan is 30 years ago now, right?  Wow.  At least.  Yeah.  Wait, Reagan was 80.  Yeah, yeah.  80.  It's like 40-something, right?  Wait.  I have no idea what year it is.  30.  30-something.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Damn.  So he was in his 30s.  Maybe early 40s.  He looked older than that, didn't he?  And that's him now?  He just hasn't aged since then, I guess.  Not necessarily.  No, that's not him now.  That's got to be known.  Dark sunglasses.  No, the picture they just showed on CNN, he looks a little...  That's a funny little hat.  A little different than that.  He wears his I hate the West hat.  I love their little military uniforms that don't mean anything.  It's just, I'm the president, so I've got to put on a military uniform.  Right.  And look, his head is leaning all the way to the side to keep the hat on his head. 
[00:31:00]  He's wearing a hat like Lucille Ball used to wear the hat pinned to the side of her head.  Oh, Viv.  That's a horrible hat.  It's an awful hat.  Might have to tweet that one.  That's bad.  It's sideways.  He almost looks like a Cub Scout or something.  Like that one.  Oh, there you go.  Wow, she's fucking sexy.  Yeah, she is.  She's wearing a little Pillbox hat. 
[00:31:30]  What was it back then?  They wore the hats like on the side of their head.  I don't know, man.  Your chicks are fucked up.  Some of those hats are coming back.  Yeah, yeah.  I see them as I walk around doing my loop in Manhattan.  Now, Gaddafi, you take that hat back to the store.  I'm not paying for that.  Wah.  Yeah, he's leaning over so the hat doesn't fall off his head.  Some of those weird hats are starting to come back, though.  Yeah, the ones with the fucking netting on them.  Well, I don't know if the netting, but...  Pull that net over the face. 
[00:32:00]  I think they're starting to bring the hats back with that one feather from that fucking  bird that only has like seven birds left in the whole country.  Yeah, the little feather.  Some bird that's about to be extinct, they put one of their feathers on the hat and sell  it to these broads.  The hat.  And it's useless.  It's just...  It doesn't keep your head warm.  No, it's...  It's a little dot on your head.  It just looks like it's a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  Pillbox hat, if you want to look it up at home. 
[00:32:30]  The Pillbox.  What is that?  Or the flapper type hat.  It's just like a black fucking flapjack.  Oh, yeah.  On the side of your head.  Like a waffle or...  Not a waffle.  Like a pancake or something?  Looks like a pancake.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With some little decorations on it on the side of your head.  It does absolutely nothing but make you look silly.  Yeah, look at her.  Yeah, in the middle of the fucking screen right there.  No, all the way down.  Down.  Right there.  Yeah, yeah.  What is that?  Like, what purpose does that serve?  She has...  It amounts to... 
[00:33:00]  It's like a jar lid.  It's like a lid of a jar painted black with some feathers on it.  Yeah.  Stuck to the side of her head.  With some of that baby's breath.  The baby's breath.  It looks a little like baby's breath.  And a couple fucking feathers from a burr that's going to be extinct soon.  And taffeta.  Does it have taffeta on it?  God, we suck.  This is a fur store I've walked by.  I want to go in there so bad.  It just caused a major commotion.  You know the one I'm talking about?  I think it's...  It drives me nuts.  And I'm not a PETA guy. 
[00:33:30]  I swear to God.  But when it comes to this over-the-top shit, that's where my line is.  Everyone has lines when it comes to all this stuff.  Mine is when you see these fucking fur coats.  Really?  Yes.  I saw two on the elevator, a couple, an older couple.  And I wanted to fucking brain them both.  It drives me nuts.  I have to hold myself back.  Yeah, I hate them.  I hate them.  I don't think they have an opinion on that.  Oh, I hate them.  It's the over-the-top, man.  You know, with these fur coats that are just, you know, scraping the ground and the fucking... 
[00:34:00]  You see the dead animal's face on the hats and stuff.  That's always good.  Or on the shoulder.  Coming over their shoulder like, hey, look.  On the shoulder of the coats.  It drives me insane.  Off the shoulder.  That's funny.  You'll never see me out there protesting or throwing the paint, but man, it gets to me.  I love...  I wish I had the balls and I would never do it, but I love the fact that they throw paint  on these fucking cunts.  Oh, absolutely.  Fucking cunts.  Love it.  And I know...  I know...  I have no...  I can't justify that. 
[00:34:30]  Like, you can kill me a million ways in inconsistencies.  I don't care.  I love when they throw paint on people in fucking long fur coats.  Because that's your line.  I mean, we can take calls now.  You know, what about the shoes you're wearing?  The poor cow that gave the leather.  Do you have a leather belt on?  Yes, I understand all that.  There's a difference between using animal stuff and being an over-the-top vein display.  Yeah.  Like, you know what I mean?  I don't think I'm wearing a leather belt or there's a little leather in my...  I'm not...  But when you have a fucking... 
[00:35:00]  Just a vein fur coat display, you're just a cunt.  You're just a cunt.  You really are.  You're a cunt and you deserve to have paint thrown on you.  I wouldn't buy one because I just wouldn't give a shit.  But it doesn't...  I don't even think about it.  If I see somebody walk by with a big fur coat, I don't even think about it, really.  Oh.  Yeah.  Just...  It literally...  It makes you want to physically assault them.  See, Vince...  Yeah.  Vince would be on a regular. 
[00:35:30]  So, Vince...  Yeah, this is his opinion.  It's fine, Vince.  What am I going to do?  Yell and scream at you?  It's the fur of a rodent.  Stop being a faggot, Ope.  Yoga's okay.  Being a fur-hating fag isn't.  Fur-hating fag.  Look, then you have no problem with it.  It drives me nuts.  Yeah.  But it's always driven me nuts when you see these over-the-top rich people.  Always.  Yeah.  I don't care how much money I have.  When I see the over-the-top rich people, it drives me fucking insane.  Because it doesn't serve any need other than just to show that you're rich and it takes... 
[00:36:00]  It's barbaric how they have to get...  It's just...  Everybody knows why it's awful.  Everybody knows why.  Everybody knows.  I'm not a fucking vegetarian.  I wish I could give up chicken and cows.  I love them.  Those yummy fucks.  They're delicious.  I'm certainly hypocritical, but...  Big, yummy fucking cow.  Steer.  And that's where PETA loses people because they're so extreme in one direction.  It's like, I agree with them on a lot of this stuff.  It's like, you become so self-righteous.  Yeah, there's no room for anything with them. 
[00:36:30]  You're either...  You're in or you're out.  Yeah, don't walk on the grass because you're stepping on bugs kind of a thing.  No.  Are they that bad?  Oh, yeah.  I knew some girl that...  Oh, fuck the bugs.  See, there you go.  She would scream.  If you walked on the grass.  Who?  Some chick in high school.  She'd be like, stop it!  You know, you're killing bugs!  We'd all laugh at her and just...  And then we'd find bugs and just step on them in front of her.  I'm sure there's a bug person out there. 
[00:37:00]  I say, fuck the bugs.  Yeah.  Fuck the bugs.  Yeah, does PETA fucking fight for bed bugs?  Yeah.  You don't see them ever fighting, hey, don't kill bed bugs.  Maybe they're the most intelligent fucking beings in this universe.  Ah, you think?  What were we to say?  Well, we all know it's Watson, so let's leave that alone.  Stupid Watson won a lot of money last night.  Watson, it's all going to charity, I guess.  If he's so great, I want to see him spend the money now.  Yeah, go ahead.  Buy something.  Go buy something.  See what you buy.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:37:30]  You're just going to sit there and do nothing now.  Buy a new plug or something to put in the wall.  What's he going to buy?  Watson.  That's it.  Yes, Chip.  Who?  Don't be impressed with Watson.  Don't be impressed.  No.  That's all the damn thing does.  It's a one-trick pony?  Now he's not doing Jeopardy.  He's going to bore the shit out of everybody with his fucking Jeopardy knowledge.  He has nothing else to offer.  Did you watch?  No, they're showing it right there.  IBM Computer won three days.  I think he won 77,000 or something.  Challenge.  He beat everybody. 
[00:38:00]  I like its little fucking monitor thing with its fancy graphic.  Yeah.  And what did these guys win?  Anything?  Uh...  No.  What?  Watson won more than 77,000.  Why did I see 77,000?  That might have been his dollar amount total.  Yeah.  Oh.  But for winning the entire thing, it was a million dollar prize.  Oh, whoa.  Which they gave...  His actual earnings on the show was 77,000. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, something like that.  And then the million dollar grand prize or whatever.  Oh, I gotcha.  They donated to charity.  Aw.  What charity?  Who cares?  I got so much money anyway.  Just kidding.  What's wrong with keeping your money?  Keep it.  You won.  Yeah, I know.  I never understood that.  Like, when celebrities are on game shows, they have celebrity jeopardy.  There's probably a hundred guys that worked on that project, that Watson project.  Split up the money.  Yeah.  Give it to them.  No.  No.  They probably got the same management team.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Let me go to Rich in Long Island.  This is true.  Uh, Rich, go ahead.  How you doing?  Uh, just want that Jimmy being a pussy about throwing paint on people.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Throw paint on my coat.  I'll go get another fur coat, kill another fucking dozen animals, and start all over again  until you're asked for it.  Uh-huh.  He got you there, Jimmy.  I didn't say I would throw paint on it, but you wouldn't do that.  So shut up.  What's that, sir? 
[00:39:30]  They make you pay for it, too.  Well, there you go.  They kill a dozen more animals.  So you're not going to offend me by...  Stop trying to offend mom by saying the F word.  Sue everyone.  I'll kill all the animals.  I don't care if you kill them by fucking them to death.  You're fucking full of shit.  Do you have a fur coat, sissy?  Do you?  No, I know.  Then stop speculating like you might have one.  Stop getting mad like you're the rich old lady.  Right.  You don't have a fur coat, lady. 
[00:40:00]  Shut up.  What do you have?  Are your parents?  Well, fuck them, then.  Fuck them.  I don't have.  I can't argue with that.  Stop defending your dumb parents and their shitty choice of needing a fur coat.  Let them have self-esteem.  If it wasn't for the fur trade, no one would ever get passed in Mississippi.  What's that?  Yeah, I don't know.  I heard you.  If it wasn't for the fur trade, yeah, I heard you, too.  Good.  The West was won by trading pelts.  Yes, yes, yes, indeed. 
[00:40:30]  Rich, why are you getting mad?  We're not telling everyone to think like we think.  Because we're insulting his parents.  Yeah, why are you getting mad?  We even said this, you know.  No, I'm saying it.  If you own just an over-the-top fur coat, you're a cunt.  And I said that very definitively.  Yeah.  And it bothers you because your parents have that?  No, no.  It bothers me that people would go out and ruin somebody's fur coat.  You know, I don't like Anthony's car, so I should take a fur coat.  But I think you understand, dude, I think you understand the difference in why a fur coat 
[00:41:00]  is despicable and why a car is different.  I think you know the difference, though.  And if Anthony's car had baby seal hubcaps, then certainly we should fucking destroy his  car.  Having him put on.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  He'd be the first in the neighborhood.  You know the difference.  His little cute, spinning faces.  That's great.  With that last look of, what are you doing?  Yeah, hey.  Did you come to feed me?  I'm too, yeah.  They're like, oh, he wants to pet us.  No, he doesn't.  That's not a petting device.  Petting stick.  It's a club. 
[00:41:30]  So Rich is mad because his parents have fur coats.  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever, man.  I'm mad because what?  We're not telling everyone to think like us.  That's the beauty of our show.  Other shows want you to think like the host.  We just throw our opinions out there.  If you agree, great.  If you don't, that's fine.  Whatever.  Go kill the animals.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Oh, no.  By the way, he just hung up on us.  Yes.  This guy wouldn't fucking kill an animal.  I would love to see him kill an animal.  He can't do it.  It takes a psychopath to do what we're seeing on the screen. 
[00:42:00]  Danny's pulling up some pictures of guys clubbing baby shields.  I can't say that.  I would be very happy if somebody was hunting and a stray bullet  hit those guys.  I would be very happy.  And not even killed if they were just paralyzed by a stray bullet.  If you can do that for a living, if you can just stand outside and club it out,  you're a fucking, you really don't serve any purpose.  You could probably kill people.  You could probably become a serial killer. 
[00:42:30]  Absolutely.  If you could look at the little face going, look at that little face is going, and he's  just clubbing it over the head repeatedly.  Yeah.  Look at the little face.  Yeah.  They're adoring.  How do you, I don't know how you do that.  It's like taking a puppy.  I don't know.  The cutest little puppy that's looking up at you with big eyes and smashing its head  open.  I would respect these guys if they killed these seals by punching them to death.  Like if you actually went in there and bare knuckled it and beat the shit out of it, 
[00:43:00]  I would respect you.  It is done clocking them with rights.  Ted Nugent's a guy like, he uses every fucking, this is a horse of hats.  You know, that's a guy I respect though, because he eats what he kills.  Like he's, he's an outdoorsman.  Like none of us are.  Like he takes the deer meat and bear meat to the homeless shelters.  Does he?  And yeah.  He really uses that.  Yeah.  He's, uh, he's exhausting.  How, but he does actually, he's not being efficient.  He loves killing things.  Yeah.  But he does use them. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Look, man, a lot of people call him cause their parents have fur coats.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Yeah.  Why does it have, why do you have to defend it because your parents have it?  Right.  You know, it's shitty.  It's old school.  It's 1950s thinking.  Yep.  You know, full, full disclosure, man.  There was one Christmas.  My dad brought a fur coat home to my mom, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  And my, my, my dad did well that, uh, that year.  We had a very weird, uh, bringing up, man.  Either some money was coming in or nothing at all. 
[00:44:00]  So one year he'd made some kind of big business deal.  My dad was an entrepreneur.  Or that's how we describe it.  Cause I don't really know what he did.  And, uh, he brought a fur coat home one Christmas.  My mom looked at it.  It wasn't for her.  Yeah.  She said, you got to bring this back.  I can't wear this.  Take it back.  And even as a little kid.  I don't care where you got it.  Take it back.  Even as a little kid, I was thinking, oh my God.  Yeah.  But it wasn't like the PETA guy by any means.  They feel so nice though.  I don't care.  There's no synthetic that feels like real fur. 
[00:44:30]  It's so soft.  Lovely.  Uh, yeah.  Let's, uh, remind people of this.  Nate in Michigan.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Nate.  Hey, I was wondering if you'd be offended if you knew about my, uh, koala bear ear hair hat.  Yeah.  And my, uh, and my, uh, bald eagle eye necklace and lion mane coat.  Old bit.  Basically, he's bringing up the Patrice bit. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, of course.  We had fun with this whole thing.  Yes.  How ridiculous human beings could be.  I'm not even offended by fur coats.  I just like when people throw paint on them.  I like it.  I like it.  I think, I think throwing paint is kind of old school.  I don't, I don't, I don't remember hearing a news story where somebody got paint on their  coat.  Well, they might be charging another salt not for that.  Maybe they might be charging.  It's probably a hate crime, you know.  It's less people wearing fur, too.  Yeah.  You know.  Especially since they can make, I think, synthetic fur or fake fur that's pretty fucking 
[00:45:30]  close.  Well, that was my, uh, I see that guy mentioning it.  My, my, uh, big, uh, fur coat that my mother bought me when I was, um, in the fifth  grade, I believe it was.  Uh.  Because Joe Namath had been wearing a fur coat, uh, on the sidelines, um, she decided  that in the fifth grade, I would be just like Joe Namath and looked at just like it.  Like, oh boy, look at that.  I could respect a, a guy that's wearing a fur, a full length fur coat to school. 
[00:46:00]  It's like, what is this, the forties?  They made fun of you?  Made fun of me with their fists.  It's like, you can't, you can't wear a fur coat to school without getting a belt.  That's right.  You were Mo Namath.  And how warm were you, man?  Oh, I was toasty warm.  Toasty.  Oh, it was just, oh, and the names.  Just called me.  What were the names they called you?  Faggot.  You know, things like that.  The go-to?  Cry. 
[00:46:30]  That was the go-to one.  Yeah.  And it's like, oh, look, you, you, were you a bear?  And that would make me cry.  How do you, how do you feel about the word faggot?  A lot of, a lot of homosexuals really want that word to go away.  I love that word.  When we were growing up, we used it, didn't even know what it fucking meant.  I'm not talking about homosexuality when I, uh, say the word faggot.  It's, it's just, don't be a faggot.  Can we, like, change it so it doesn't mean, like, the, like, the, the real meaning?  Kind of like what they did with the N-word?  When I say it, it doesn't even mean, it's not like, you know, it's, being a faggot doesn't 
[00:47:00]  mean you're a homosexual.  It means you're being a faggot.  It means you're not fucking being, uh, one of the guys.  You're not fucking, you're being an asshole, or you're being fucking, like, uh, you, you,  you, you're, you're not going out tonight.  Don't be a faggot.  Yeah, when'd you get that car, faggot?  You're gonna drive that Prius, faggot?  You know, that's, that's what it means.  So, like the N-word, you know how they say nigga.  Yeah.  So maybe we could change it, so then it doesn't really mean it. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah?  I don't know.  The thing is, I'm tired of the, the words, I don't think faggot should be taken out.  Gay people have to realize.  I don't think any of these words should be taken out.  Of course not.  But, uh, you know what?  It's just a, a word that you're gonna have to live with not liking.  You know what I mean?  It's like, stop it.  Yeah, yeah, just deal with it.  I, I understand.  Stop it.  If someone walks up to a gay couple walking down the street and says, let's beat up these  faggots, that is not the context to use that word.  Right.  And that is inciting, uh, uh, violence and what, what have you. 
[00:48:00]  But if you just call your friend a faggot for, uh, you know, oh, you're not chipping  it for gas, you faggot?  Come on.  Yeah.  Give me money.  Yeah.  That's, that's what it is.  Yeah.  Gay people, any group, midgets, just everybody shut the fuck up about your words.  Little people.  Exactly.  No.  But then little people are gonna be the word that they're offended by.  Yeah.  It never ends.  Once people start using it a lot, it becomes a bad word.  Then it becomes the word. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  The N-word is starting to get a little, uh, a little, uh, under, under people's skin a  little bit at this point.  Oh.  Yeah, because you, you can now freely say the word without saying it.  Just saying the N-word.  I always have that discussion many times, obviously, but someone bringing up the fact that I looked  at a, uh, Stingray skin jewelry box for Valentine's Day.  Oh, now there you go.  I was not gonna.  But I wasn't gonna buy that.  Yeah.  But that's what I'm talking about.  But if the price was right, you would.  If the price was right, I probably would have bought it.  It wasn't an ethical, it wasn't an ethical decision you were making. 
[00:49:00]  You were making a financial decision.  You're probably right.  Uh, Stingray skin.  And Stingray, do Stingrays have expressions?  No, they have a fucking, apparently they got a stinger in their tail that goes through  idiots' chests.  Right.  Stingray.  I don't know.  That's the actual eye of a Stingray, you think?  No, no, no.  That's the skin.  Oh, Stingray skin holsters?  Holsters.  Yeah, please.  They're like, they're like fish though.  I don't feel the same way toward fishes as some of the animals. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Although the dolphins, you want to see a fucking documentary?  Well, that's a mammal.  Go see the cove.  Yeah, it is a mammal.  The cove will drive you fucking nuts.  Yeah, yeah.  Have you seen the cove?  Yeah.  Where they just herd them into that little...  That's rough, man.  That type of mentality...  That's what we're talking about today.  That's rough.  It's a piggish behavior that people engage in.  Like, not...  Again, there's a fucking common sense.  If you behave in that kind of thing, you're a fucking pig.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a fucking pig.  They don't look at them as the intelligent animals that they are. 
[00:50:00]  Just because they live in the water and resemble fish, because that's the best body style to  have when you're in the water, doesn't mean they're not smart and mammals.  You know, they're fucking mammals.  They're like a dog or some shit, you know?  They don't care anyway.  No, they don't.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't care.  You ever swim with the dolphins?  I'm going to be doing that on my cruise.  Give me a full report.  We're going on a cruise.  They don't swim with the dolphins. 
[00:50:30]  Where?  Where?  Hopefully, as you're doing it, you see pirate ships.  Oh, and I love Anthony to be fucking kidnapped by fucking Somalians.  I think it's in, like, Honduras or something.  I think I'm going to Honduras.  What the fuck is that?  I don't know.  It's down somewhere where there used to be violence.  How long is your cruise?  Two weeks.  Oh, you go over here.  Two weeks with the fam and friends and shit like that.  And you're doing the dolphins?  Yeah.  You're going to notice they do all that stuff for the food.  I thought I was having a connection with the dolphins. 
[00:51:00]  No, no.  It's all about...  You don't have a connection with the dolphins.  It's all about yum-yums.  It's all about the trainer and properly feeding them.  It's all about num-nums.  You know when they wave at you?  I thought they really were waving at you because they were sad you were leaving.  Really?  They don't?  Nope.  It's food?  It's for the food.  Pricks.  You want this little fish?  Then fucking take your little nose and put it on the bottom of his feet and push him forward.  I thought he just enjoyed doing that.  No, huh?  No, man. 
[00:51:30]  I was so disappointed.  Oh, you couldn't make a connection with him?  No, man.  Did you look into his eyes and like...  Yeah, just darkness.  You go like, oh, hi.  Just darkness.  I don't even think they have pupils.  What about them teeth?  They got them little fucking stalker patty teeth.  Oh, dolphins?  Yeah, they have little stalker patty teeth.  Little stalker patty teeth.  Those chiclets.  Look, little sharpened chiclets.  I thought there would be some kind of slight connection, but you realize right away they're  doing it all for this fucking food.  Did you rub his little dome head?  Yeah.  Didn't he like it?  Did he move his head like... 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, because the trainer had a fish behind my head.  Oh, God.  They play tricks on you, too, going, oh, look, he likes it.  No, I'm holding a fish behind your head.  Fucking trying to look around you for the fish.  Like, get out of my way, tourist.  That little fin wave is the animal in pain because there's somebody underwater pinching  his genitals with tweezers.  That's him going, hey, get back here.  Help me out.  I got something on my helmet.  See, proper use of the word.  Wave, faggot.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:52:30]  See?  See?  Doesn't mean the dolphin takes penis up its little dolphin behind.  Yeah, I'm going to be doing that.  That's cool.  I don't know what that looks like.  It was all right.  I just want to see what they feel like.  They're very smooth.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was cool, but it's just, you realize, you know, they're just these poor dolphins.  Let them go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just leave them alone.  Yeah, but see, I did that.  I supported the whole dolphin thing.  But they look real healthy and, like, well-fed and...  Yeah, and I guess...  You know.  And they don't have to worry about predators.  And I guess you're learning about dolphins and wildlife, so maybe that helps somewhere 
[00:53:00]  down the road.  I don't know.  They've got to do that under the guise that they're educating.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, absolutely.  And the dolphins, you know what the dolphins' major predator is on Earth?  It is man.  I love the guilt fucking thing whenever you're going through any exhibit with animals.  Somebody's got to bring up, and there's only five tigers left in the world because 
[00:53:30]  of man.  No natural predators for the tiger, yet their numbers have...  And then you guys sit there and go, oh, I'm a prick.  And they go, and we have one of the tigers in the cage, just to let you know, there's only  five left.  Here's what you've done.  And then there's pictures.  How about we have six tigers left in the wild?  How about you let this fucking tiger go?  Put that one back.  And then you've got the savages.  If you go to some of these places, with a bucket for the dolphins.  Collected for the dolphins.  Collected for the dolphins. 
[00:54:00]  I'm like, can I have a receipt, please, from my accountant?  Yeah, is this tax deductible?  Just fucking cash going into buckets, supposedly for the dolphins.  Sure it is.  What the hell is that about?  Dolphins are horrible with money anyway.  Oh, my God.  They're terrible.  All they do is buy long nose cleaning things.  I didn't know what to say.  That's why you're going to be in Cincinnati this weekend.  Oh, yeah.  I tried tonight through Saturday.  Funny boat.  And I noticed Kenny had his traveling clothes on. 
[00:54:30]  By the way, I hate how humiliating it is, because people think Kenny and I are part of a gang.  Tall guy and faggot.  We have the same jacket.  So we walk in and I do these radio shows on the road or the TV shows.  Both have the same jacket on.  But they think we planned it.  Oh.  We didn't.  Oh.  Really?  And his is like 80 sizes bigger than yours.  Yeah.  Why do you have the same jacket?  How'd that happen?  I don't know.  It's very close.  No, it's the same jacket.  Copy me.  He copied me.  He's a copycat.  Copycat.  Couldn't break his mother's back. 
[00:55:00]  No guest today.  Thank fucking God.  When I saw that...  I mean, we love talking to the people, but thank God.  We need a break.  I fucking went through the emails and I saw no guests.  And I was just like, oh, thank God.  I'm tired of people coming in here, sitting down.  And like, I mean, you know, a lot of them are very cool.  But some of them, it's just like, oh, God, I have nothing to say to this person.  I hate looking at him going, I'm way more famous than you.  Why am I giving you attention? 
[00:55:30]  How about you fucking give me attention?  How about you interview me?  No one cares what they're talking about.  No.  No one fucking gives a shit.  I mean, God bless you.  You know, God bless you with your career and what you want to do with your life and everything.  But I'm asking these questions that I don't give a fuck about.  Just fill in time.  Yeah.  Tomorrow, though, we have Triple H, our old friend.  Now, Triple H is a good guy.  He's funny.  He's fun.  We've had a long relationship with him.  I'm crying. 
[00:56:00]  I miss him tomorrow.  And William H.  Fuck him crying.  William H.  Macy.  William H.  Macy.  That's a big one.  That's a big one.  But you know what?  I've heard him on other shows.  Oh, you have?  Well, we'll get him going.  That's all I'll say right now.  All I'm going to do is Fargo impressions.  Oh, he's going to love that.  Whatever.  He doesn't like it?  He's going to fucking love that.  He don't like a leaf.  I'll tell you right now, he's going to fucking love that.  Don't like a leaf.  Tell them that your wife has an ass in her cock. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, an ass in her cock.  Please ask them about that flub.  Yes.  I really think that was just a mistake they left in, which I love.  An ass in her cock.  My wife's got an ass in her cock in the driveway in Boogie Nights.  Tremendous actor.  That was great.  Tell them your favorite movie with him is The House of Games.  Really?  Say, dude, your best performance is in The House of Games with Joe Mantegna.  Was it good?  He's in it for like one scene.  He plays a guy in a fucking Western Union, and Mantegna is showing this woman how to con people. 
[00:57:00]  And he goes, now here's the con, and he tells her about this con.  Don't con me, Biff.  And he goes in to use it on, and it's William Macy is the guy in the fucking, just the guy sitting there, and he's in it for like a minute.  That's awesome.  It's great.  I'm writing that down.  All you should talk about is fucking House of Games.  What was Mantegna like?  You know, how do they treat you?  Have you ever gone back to that Western Union office?  I have 50 questions about that scene.  Were those your shoes?  He's been in a shitload of movies, man. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  He was in The Cooler.  Yeah, yeah.  The Cooler was a great movie, wasn't it?  Yep.  I liked The Cooler.  And of course, he's promoting Shameless, which I'm only a couple episodes in, but kind of liking that show.  Yes.  On, I think, Showtime, right?  Yeah, Showtime.  All right, we'll break and get into some other stuff.  Justin Bieber.  Jesus.  I know.  I feel the same way.  He's dreamy.  Oh, God.  What about him?  Cover the Rolling Stone.  I'll tell you what about him next.  You had a good tweet about it, actually, yesterday.  Yeah.  Oh, his stance.  Yeah, you had a good tweet about it. 
[00:58:00]  We'll talk about Justin Bieber and what he's saying in Rolling Stone Magazine.  And other stuff, I guess.  I don't know what else.  We'll figure it out.  The Virus Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Daily faces, and he writes about that crap.  That old school. 
[00:58:30]  Morning, Opie and Anthony.  Lots going on today.  I love my Twitter.  The guy writes, big story on the Nick Cannon Show.  Oh.  This is stoned again, 82.  Yeah, I'm confused with stoned again, 82.  He wanted me to retweet one of his tweets because he said, look, today I'm five years sober.  I remember this guy.  Yeah.  So I did the right thing, you know.  He's trying to better himself.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Give him a retweet.  But then everyone, I didn't notice his Twitter name at the time. 
[00:59:00]  And everyone's like, what?  You know, maybe he should change his fucking Twitter name if he's taking this not partying thing seriously.  Yeah.  His name is stoned again, 82.  But he's five years sober, supposedly.  I want to take back my retweet.  I was, all I did last night for about a half hour straight was retweet everybody that asked  for a retweet.  Oh, wow.  And it just wouldn't stop.  It got more people.  Every time I got done with the page of retweets, I would refresh and it was like 90. 
[00:59:30]  So I'm just going, retweet, retweet, retweet.  And just retweeting everybody.  It was so annoying.  It was just obnoxious to people that get an alert whenever I tweet.  I know that.  Yeah, it's like a ride.  I'll get done following you for a while.  And then, yeah, yeah.  Taylor said if I retweeted her, she would pull her boobs out.  So she did.  Oh, nice. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  That's the reason to retweet, right?  Taylor Vixen.  So I did one more retweet of her.  Taylor Vixen.  Oh, the girl.  Yeah.  Plant Penhouse girl.  Oh, yeah.  And she tweeted a picture of her showing her tits.  Nice.  And everybody was like, wow, okay, that was worth it then.  I don't go for that.  Oh, yes.  Hey, I retweeted a Brie Olsen tweet.  Yeah.  That was Brie.  She said, she was talking about her day and she said, today I'm going to take a black 
[01:00:30]  dick in my ass and then talk to Dr. Drew.  So I retweeted that and then said, wow, I thought I was having a shitty day.  Yeah, that's.  And then some asshole writes, yeah, I wouldn't want to talk to Dr. Drew either.  Made me laugh really hard.  That is fun.  Made me laugh really hard, whoever you are.  But that's implying he wants a dick in his ass, though.  It doesn't make sense.  And then someone else tweeted, Brie, if you talk to Dr. Drew first, then maybe you don't 
[01:01:00]  have to take the big black dick in your ass.  Take the dick in your ass.  And then it all ended with fucking buzz kills going, hey, you know, she likes black dick  in her ass.  Leave her alone.  Everyone's got to fucking jump in and just say dumb things.  But it made me laugh for a few minutes.  I love that.  So we got a Nick Cannon update, Anthony, from Stoned Again 82, which Danny brings up a good  point.  Twitter's been around only three, three and a half years.  He's been sober five years.  So he chose this name a year and a half into his sobriety. 
[01:01:30]  Well, it was already sober.  Maybe it reminds him.  I don't know.  And you don't have to explain it to me because I'm going to forget you as soon as I move on  from this little tweet here.  He goes, big story on the Nick Cannon show.  People need more than four hours of sleep a night.  Four hours of sleep.  And then he writes, regular radio sucks a dick.  That's what Nick Cannon's talking about today.  You need four hours of sleep a night.  But that's not the big story at our old station, Anthony.  No, no, no. 
[01:02:00]  I like to peruse David Hinckley's column every once in a while.  Why?  Because I'm a student of radio.  And why read that?  So is David Hinckley because he writes about radio in the Daily News here in New York.  And, man, we haven't been in his column in, I would say, we haven't been in his column  for anything substantial in years.  I mean years.  I don't think he likes the show. 
[01:02:30]  You think?  Not anymore.  Because we're doing some stuff that should get in the paper every once in a while.  Some of our fantastic interviews.  And if you hear what I have to read here, then you would understand our point.  But XRK, that's our old station that we got kicked off of, orders a couple of rings at  White Castle.  What?  That's the headline.  Jimmy just fucking threw us.  What was he doing?  Who?  The radio station or David Hinckley?  Both.  If you want a White Castle burger Saturday in the Bronx, you may have to wait. 
[01:03:00]  There's a wedding going on.  There's a wedding going on.  David Hinckley had a right about this.  Do you know how old hack fucking shit this is?  And he's writing like it's legit.  I mean, legit meaning there's no jokes in here.  There's no sarcasm.  There's nothing.  Right.  He thinks this is a great radio bit.  XRK is throwing its second annual White Castle listener wedding.  This time for Danielle and Hector of the Bronx. 
[01:03:30]  Showtime is 2 to 4 p.m. at the White Castle.  XRK evening host Chunky.  Remember Chunky?  Oh, no.  Not Chunky.  Is that who this is?  Dude!  We're going to have a wedding at White Castle!  Dude!  Dude!  Yeah.  So, White Castle wedding.  Chunky.  A jock from the station, naturally, will DJ. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, of course.  Morning host Nick Cannon notified the couple on Valentine's Day that they'd been selected from some 30 entrants.  Valentine's Day.  This is what regular radio's doing.  And the couple, they've been together for four years and they have a son.  Okay.  But had not been able to afford a wedding.  Am I getting kind of a line on what couple this is?  Yeah.  I already gave that away when I said their last names. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah?  What are their names?  Danielle and the Vumbadadza and Hector Vumbadadaba.  Okay.  You know, names that you can't really pronounce.  Yeah, yeah.  If you're as white as me.  This is a special family, says Cannon.  We're giving them a wedding event they'll never forget.  Not everyone can say they got married in a castle.  Not a joke to be had here.  A castle.  Chunky.  I know that was supposed to be a joke, but hence, not a joke to be had here.  No joke.  Chunky, who also was best man at the station's first White Castle wedding last year, says the event. 
[01:05:00]  Jimmy, are we losing you?  But how did he be best man?  The person didn't know him.  Yeah.  Why is Chunky your best man?  Chunky.  And why is David Hickley writing about it?  And why are they doing this?  It's big radio news.  Uh, let's see.  Chunky was...  The fugitive.  I'm the fugitive.  Oh, well, a dog came over.  And I was petting him.  One of my favorite fucking... 
[01:05:30]  And he talks regular.  Yeah.  The fugitive.  I mean...  Yeah.  That was amazing.  Well, a dog came over, and I wasn't sure...  I wasn't sure if the owner...  One of my favorite fucking bits.  We're going to have to play it again.  And Chunky was the best man at the station's first White Castle wedding last year, says  the event is a lot of fun, but it's also a real wedding. 
[01:06:00]  Ah.  The restaurant brings out trays of food for the guests and everything.  The restaurant?  Because the restaurant...  It's a White Castle.  They keep calling it a restaurant in this article.  Because the restaurant closes the dining area for the wedding, Chunky says neighborhood  people came by last year and peeked through the window.  Ah, wow.  Wow, that's crazy.  Sounds like an insane scene there.  Another part of the fun, he says.  Another part?  Where was the first part? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, don't you have to have a first part of the fun to say another part of the fun?  It's things like this that, I swear, makes me so embarrassed to be in this business.  Yeah.  I don't even tell people I'm in radio anymore.  I say I'm in marketing.  I don't even want to say I'm in radio anymore.  I say I'm in broadcasting, and then when they ask, like, oh, what do you do?  Yeah.  I just go, I'm just in broadcasting.  Like, I don't really...  I don't either, man.  I never say it, because we're lumped into this horse shit.  I used to be like, well, I'm an on-air personality. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, really?  I used to have some pride.  What show, and where are you broadcasting from, and what...  Now it's just like, oh, no.  Yeah, it's a little something, something.  Google my name.  I always say I'm part of a morning team.  A morning team.  Yeah.  Part of the madness.  Well, look, man, this bit sounds great.  So they peek through the window.  Another part of the fun, he says, is that couples who go for this kind of wedding are starting 
[01:07:30]  with that love-don't-cost-a-thing attitude, so it's cool.  Yeah.  Love don't cost a thing, and it lasts through, you know, financial ruin.  No one thinks about money, as long as you have love.  Yeah.  The couple themselves are having a busy weekend with five days to get everything ready, but  Chunky says his best man slot doesn't require a lot of prep work.  Why is David Hinckley writing this?  Like, this is something that people care about. 
[01:08:00]  The only reason we're reading it is to show you how awful radio is.  Horrid.  I just put on my normal Saturday clothes, he says.  That adds to the laid-backness of it.  But now that this is my second year, I have to say I'm getting good at it.  After two?  He's done one?  Yeah.  So it's going to be an annual event, marrying people at the White Castle, and David Hinckley  thinks, wow, we really need the world to know about this.  There you go.  That sounds like a blast. 
[01:08:30]  Just great.  Did we ever do a wedding?  Honeymoon at Rikers?  What's going on there?  I don't know.  I don't think we've ever married anybody, right?  I hope not.  I'm trying to think back.  I know Ronnie married, you know, I understand.  Well, that's somebody on the show.  That worked, because you knew all the players, and it was a whole thing that led up to it.  My sister was officiating.  Yeah, I'm not taking a shot at Ronnie.  I'm talking about this fucking White Castle wedding. 
[01:09:00]  Who cares?  You don't know the players.  You don't know anybody involved.  I know.  All right.  It's just an awful idea.  Hinckley's an ass.  Yeah, he really hates us.  David, who cares?  I think in the last two years, we've done some stuff that's worth writing about.  Just the idea that he has a gig writing a radio column.  How fucking, what is it, 1958?  I know.  That fucking job won't go away.  Isn't that amazing?  It's like we're a radio column.  Who gives a shit? 
[01:09:30]  And how about you just write about, like, radio is just one little fraction of what everybody  is doing these days for their listening pleasure.  Right.  There's so many other things to fucking listen to.  I like reading on Sunday Post, the guy has a chess column.  When I get the Sunday Post, I read that.  No, no, no.  He doesn't.  No, you don't do that.  I do, actually.  I love it.  He doesn't have a chess column.  I forget his name.  It's Andy Solstice, I think his name is.  Faggy Faggarden? 
[01:10:00]  No, he's a chess grandmaster.  Grandmaster?  Yes.  Grand wizard?  No.  A chess grand wizard.  Little white hats on everybody's fucking chess piece.  No.  No.  The black pieces are scared.  What do you learn from the column?  Yeah, yeah.  He talks interesting stuff and he shows you, like, a puzzle, but he talks about...  Oh, so he talks about other things than chess?  He said interesting stuff.  That's not what I mean.  You're twisting my words to humiliate me successfully and make me look like a faggot boar. 
[01:10:30]  No, he...  And then he'll show, like...  I used to actually cut those things out of the paper and I would play out the games  that they had.  And hang them up on the walls like a beautiful mind?  And then try to cum on them.  No, but they would play, like, they'd have old games in there and they'd tell you, you  know, and I would just fucking move the pieces.  Now I have it on the computer, I do it.  I have a program.  I'll just...  Then I'll shut up.  It's on my iPad.  Please don't shut up.  I love this. 
[01:11:00]  No, no, no.  It's called...  Anyone who has an iPad, you don't need to know chess to do this.  It's called Fudge.  It's a database of chess games.  And so you can load them and then you just...  Like, let's just say you want to fucking play all of Bobby Fischer's games.  Uh-huh.  You click...  Oh, Gary Kasper.  You click on one and then you just hit the arrow.  Oh, and it shows every move.  It shows all the moves.  And you don't have to do anything and you can just watch the game be played.  It's almost like you're watching a movie of their chess board and the piece is moving. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Only even more boring.  It's fun.  I love how I'm making fun of, like, you and your interest in chess as I'm just playing Angry Birds.  A retard game.  What?  No, there's a lot of skill to that, man.  Oh, it's a retard game.  What are you talking about?  Compared to chess.  Fuck it.  It's right up there with the great games.  Play turkey foot.  No, I'm not playing turkey foot, you sicko. 
[01:12:00]  Don't make fun of that, Angry Birds.  I'm saying it's a retard game.  I play it.  You playing the Valentine's Day version?  Nah, not yet.  Do you know what makes you sound...  Hold on.  Hold on.  What's that?  I'm so gay.  That's a really...  Look at those hairs.  We should get this.  What is that?  This is actually good for the show.  And it's Wanda Sykes.  Check this out.  A Don't Say Gay commercial running on TV in New York. 
[01:12:30]  I've seen some of those.  Really?  I haven't seen that yet.  Yeah, yeah.  What's wrong with saying gay now?  They're probably saying it's a negative.  Don't say it like, you're gay.  Don't be so gay.  Don't be gay.  You can't do this.  Oh, they are.  We're not going to be the same people ever.  Huh?  Quite successfully.  It's not going to be successful.  Words hurt.  Yeah, but then we're just going to find other words.  Gee.  You're never going to get rid of this.  No.  You're just bringing a lot more attention to it.  The G word.  I like when they try to get a word to be like the N word.  Oh, you got it?  And they call it like the, you know, never use the L word. 
[01:13:00]  And you're like, what does that even mean?  What's the L word?  Like, I don't know what that is.  Lesbo.  I don't know.  I would think.  One of the great words.  Lesbo.  Lesbo.  I used to love saying that.  I like doik.  I didn't even really know what it meant.  But I like saying they're, oh.  Leszies.  Leszing out.  Yeah, leszing out.  They were leszing out.  Do you have any words?  I have a word I realized that I say to myself.  And I don't know when it started.  And I don't know.  I was embarrassed yesterday.  It's like when I talk to myself. 
[01:13:30]  It's so.  I don't think you want to look at it.  I love Jimmy.  But I don't know where it comes from.  It's a word that as a kid, I guess.  But like sometimes instead of a couple of minutes, I'll say.  I'll just do that in a couple of minutes.  No, you don't say it.  Yes, I do to myself.  For my whole life, I've done that.  Out loud or just in your head?  To myself.  But I think it.  You think it.  Instead of a couple of minutes, I think a couple of minutes.  And I don't know why.  And I realize I've been.  It's been such an automatic thought for so many years.  Is this real?  Oh, 100% real. 
[01:14:00]  This is a bit.  Also real.  My friend, when we played chess, Paul used to say, check motto.  Instead of check bait.  And I hated that.  Check motto.  I used to hate that when I would lose to him because he would go, check motto.  But yeah, a couple of minutes.  So I don't know where that comes from.  So what context would you use it?  If I'm talking to myself and I'm like, all right, I got to go out there.  I better leave in a couple of minutes.  So I don't know why.  You are a weirdo. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know why.  It's one of those things that is ingrained in your brain.  It's a word.  Yeah.  It doesn't belong there.  And I don't know where it comes from.  I have no idea.  Wow.  I don't know what started it, what it means.  Well, we got the commercial.  I'm bothered by this because it's Wanda Sykes that is a comedian.  And she should understand words.  No, I know she is.  She shouldn't be doing these type of commercials.  What do you think, Jimmy?  I don't see commercial.  All right.  Here you go.  Check out this chef, right? 
[01:15:00]  Right?  It's so gay.  It's really gay.  Look at those pants.  Please don't say that.  What?  Don't say that something is gay when you mean that something is dumb or stupid.  It's insulting.  Call it retarded.  It's like if I thought this pepper shaker was stupid and I said, man, this pepper shaker is  so 16-year-old boy with a cheesy mustache.  Just saying.  Man, when you say that's so gay, do you realize what you say?  Knock it off.  She just fucking bombed. 
[01:15:30]  Knock it off.  And then the guys were, the guy had to sit there making believe he was hurt by that?  That commercial's gay.  That was really gay.  Yeah, she should have said like, uh.  What's she doing?  Well, she should have given, they should have had a stronger example to associate.  If you're going to do it.  Like the pepper.  She should, there's a black hair at the table.  Right, right.  She should have said, honestly, she should have said, that's like saying if you look at  something's really stupid, you go, oh man, that's so, that's so African.  Or if something's really bad, that's so Jew. 
[01:16:00]  And he'd have been like, hey.  But if you want to make a word association, they shouldn't have put a joke in.  They should probably have a stronger word association.  Well, they had it.  See, even they had to be politically correct by going after the little white kid.  So they had to do it with an object that has no feelings.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I think gay people, I understand they don't want to be tormented and fucking have,  you know, they have to fight for their rights.  But I think when people harp.  Yes, exactly.  The Twisted Sister.  That was actually, all those beasties boys.  That was beasties.  Then be proud of who you are and then gay people should start the whole, that's so straight. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  I think they should just concentrate on other things instead of trying to change the language  because then people just get annoyed at you and go, shut up.  Fucking dog.  They don't understand people, special interest groups don't understand how they lose people sometimes.  I'm just going to start saying things like, oh, that's so Jesus hates you because, you  know, the Bible.  If they say that the word faggot is used in a vicious way, all right, I understand that. 
[01:17:00]  But you can't have it both ways.  Queer eye from the straight guy, queer eye from the straight guy.  That was, what, that was fine?  Queer.  Stop it.  Let's go deeper with this commercial.  That was supposed to be a, you know, a faggot commercial, but they weren't brave enough  to do a faggot commercial.  They weren't brave enough.  Because most people don't say that's so gay.  Not as much as saying, don't be a faggot.  Yeah.  Don't be a faggot.  I think it's everything with gay.  They just don't want any of their words being used when it's something that's a little gay. 
[01:17:30]  Wimpy or whatever.  Gay.  Or whatever, yeah.  And what do they, the whole premise, they point at one of those, like, ceramic pizza  making guys at the pizza shop.  And say, that's so gay.  And they're like, look at him, he's so gay.  It's just an old school, like, Guido pizza guy.  You know, we've all seen the statue with the big floppy hat.  That's not gay.  So what's next?  You can't say, don't be short with me, because that implies negativity. 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  And that's going to offend short people.  Yeah.  It's like, when you, it's just, it's going to fucking just completely spiral into absolute  nonsense.  Yeah.  It's sort of starting.  It's silly.  It's sort of starting.  You're not going to make people like gay people by saying, don't joke about that.  There's a few of those gay PSAs.  Did you find another one, Danny?  I think there's another gay PSA.  Oh, uh.  Yeah, like, because they made a whole bunch of them with dumb celebrities saying. 
[01:18:30]  I think it makes people, like, gay people seem weaker.  It annoys people seem like not as, you know, when, when gay people have their own shit they  do.  Yeah.  And their own words they use to describe stuff.  What is this for?  This is think before you speak.  The cashiers.  Are you going out to me?  I can't.  My parents say I have to be home right after work.  That's so gay.  Totally gay.  Oh, that is so Emma and Julia. 
[01:19:00]  Why are you saying that's so Emma and Julia?  Well, you know, when something is dumb or stupid, you say that's so Emma and Julia.  Who says that?  Everyone.  Imagine if who you are were used as an insult.  When you say that's so gay, do you realize what you say?  Of course, there are always white people making these slurs, too.  Of course.  It's not, it's not hammering the point home.  No, it really isn't.  Here's the point.  It's horrible.  It's a horrible campaign.  Two guys joking around, one going, come on, faggot.  That might be, you should think about what you're saying. 
[01:19:30]  Because faggot's a harsher thing.  And you don't want people to say faggot.  Okay.  You could say it's harsher.  But it's, even that would annoy me.  But not as much as this.  Even that would annoy me.  It's like, ah, that's so gay.  Who cares?  Who cares if it's so, what if it's used to, to, uh, most people don't say that's so gay anymore.  No one gives a fuck.  How about, uh, like, oh, God, that's so white trash. 
[01:20:00]  No one's, no one's going after it.  Come on, you redneck.  Nobody might, where's that, where's that PSA?  Oh, that's all common.  Oh, come on.  Like you said.  No, it won't, because that's white people.  Where is, where is it?  That's white people.  It'll never be just regular white.  That, it's got to be, uh, either sexuality with gay or, or black or fucking whatever.  But whites are completely always up for fucking, uh.  It's just all of it's irritating.  All heterosexual white.  It's irritating.  Yeah.  What does this one think before you speak?  Stop language policing.  Fitting room.  Okay, let's get to the fitting room one. 
[01:20:30]  Hold on, Danny.  Sorry, let's start over.  Do you like this top?  It's so gay.  Really?  Yeah, it's totally gay.  You know, you really shouldn't say that.  Say what?  Well, say that something's gay when you mean it's bad.  It's insulting.  To who?  What if every time something was bad, everybody said,  Ugh, that's so girl wearing a skirt as a top.  Oh, you are.  Those are cute jeans, though. 
[01:21:00]  When you say that's so gay, do you realize what you're saying?  These are terrible commercials.  The campaign is horrible.  Horrendous.  Horrendous.  I don't think you should be doing the campaign, but if you're going to do it, that's not the way to do it.  Knock it off.  It's horrible.  Just knock it off.  That was Hillary Duff, right?  Hillary Muff.  That's so Muff.  That's so gay.  These are horrible.  And see, this is where gay people, they're getting into language policing and things like going after Ron Howard or going after jokes. 
[01:21:30]  All you're doing is making yourself sound like hypersensitive assholes.  Stop it.  You're really coming off as gay.  Can we go, uh, can I play something from the good old days for everybody?  You want to hear about it?  Just because a guy is sensitive and he's an intellectual and he wears glasses, you make him out of queer.  I never said a guy who wears glasses is a queer.  A guy who wears glasses is a four-eyes.  A guy who's a fag is a queer.  Could be the best line ever.  That is fantastic. 
[01:22:00]  He's a four-eyes is my favorite part.  A four-eyes, yeah.  And that was the hottest sitcom for the time.  Oh, it was fantastic.  And now look what we got.  I was watching a clip the other day from All in the Family where Archie and Edith go to the Jeffersons.  It was a party for, I guess, Lionel was getting married.  And his fiancé had a white father and a black mother.  And, uh, I guess George Jefferson didn't know this at the time. 
[01:22:30]  And when he comes in, Archie's like, oh, I gotta see this.  So, you know, because George Jefferson was as much a racist against white people as Archie was against black people.  But when George Jefferson is having the drink, he's drinking at the bar with Archie.  And George Jefferson's mother comes over, his elderly mother comes over and tells him, I think you've had enough, George.  And he's like, I'm a big man.  You know, I'm a man.  You can't tell me how much I have to drink.  And then Archie just looks over and goes, ah, George, you shouldn't talk to your mammy that way. 
[01:23:00]  Your mammy.  And she turns around, who you calling mammy?  Mammy.  Your mammy.  And then he's all, he just had no clue.  He's like, what?  Your mammy.  But see, she was able to defend herself.  That's the difference.  Yeah, yeah.  And I believe gays could defend themselves, but these commercials make them look like a weaker person or a weaker group.  But if you hang around, you know, black people, they make fun of whitey just like whitey makes fun of blacks. 
[01:23:30]  It's, it's, it's, everyone's doing it.  After he called her mammy.  Yeah.  He goes, I thought all you colored people called your mother's mammy.  Perfect.  And it's like, that was on television.  Right.  But she didn't, you know, she fought back and she got her shots.  Yeah.  That was more based on real life.  She hated Louise.  Than these dumb commercials.  Mother Jefferson, I think, hated Louise.  If I remember right, she didn't like Wheezy.  I'm going to have to fucking start watching those shows.  Mother Jefferson was very funny. 
[01:24:00]  And the, the, the, the way it ended was, uh, like, George Jefferson was upset that the, the, the, the, that Lionel was marrying a half-white girl.  And Archie just wanted to see the reaction.  And he was pissed because, uh, everyone was getting on him for saying colored and mammy and shit like that.  And both Archie and George is standing at the bar at one point at the end of the show drinking.  And, uh, they toast and they're like, you know, what's this world coming to? 
[01:24:30]  Both of them.  And they're like, yeah, the good old days.  The long gone good old days where you could just, you know, be a racist.  And, oh, and, and, and at one point, George Jefferson actually said, uh, because the, the couple now was fighting.  Right.  The, the, uh, um, the white and black couple were fighting.  And he goes, watch, I guarantee in five seconds, he calls a nigger.  Wow.  And, and Archie turns around and goes, oh, geez, you didn't have to say that.  He goes, I ain't used that word in three years. 
[01:25:00]  And that was a fucking sitcom.  And that was their, that was their line, by the way, because he never said that word.  No, no, no, no, he didn't.  It was everything else.  I remember correctly.  Spade.  Right.  Cause he was a bigot, but he wasn't a racist.  Like Archie didn't, he didn't hate black.  He was just frustrated and annoyed.  And he was ignorant about like things.  That's all it was.  And, and, and it was obviously because of just the time he was raised in and lived in.  And, and he just was one of those old guys that never changed. 
[01:25:30]  So it was an honest look at, at somebody.  Maybe I'll call my friend Sherman and ask him about that episode.  Oh, really?  Let's get Sherman on.  Sherman.  We've had the Sherman on.  That was a good one.  A long time ago.  Lionel's engagement.  That's long.  It's long, but you.  All right.  If you get it, if you get something that's worth it.  If you go to the, go to the part where they're arguing and yeah, that, that's far in.  Danny will find it.  Yeah.  No problem.  And he, and he, he drops the end bomb.  Cause that's a great clip. 
[01:26:00]  Who says it?  Uh, George says it.  And then Archie has a little comeback to it, which is good.  I think that was, uh, no, that's back further.  Hey, uh, I didn't know this.  Rogan has a YouTube clip about why he doesn't use the word faggot anymore.  I'd like to hear that.  Really?  Really?  It's Joe Rogan's about, uh, defending language in general, right?  Being excited.  I am getting mad.  Listen to it, Louise.  That's what happens when you mix black and white.  Ten more seconds, he's gonna call a nigga. 
[01:26:30]  Listen to that.  I ain't used that word in three years.  He's all offended.  Louise, I'm getting madder.  Listen to this dame over here.  In another minute, she's gonna call him, huh?  Hi, we've got the records.  Ugh, now it just gets old.  I love the bike, though.  God damn, was Rob Reiner the good, mopey liberal?  What a dumb liberal. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, was he the best?  I hate it.  I hate it.  What's her name?  Oh.  Hi, Danny.  What's your name?  Oh, look.  Go get fat there, little guy.  Yeah, raise some money for the, uh, black kids with the, uh, flies around their head.  You're hungry, you know what.  Huh?  Huh?  Hey.  Oh, look at that.  I haven't used that word in three years.  Like he's offended from hearing it.  I couldn't believe he just heard that.  That's great.  The Sammy fucking episode.  Ah.  Do you like some cream in your eye? 
[01:27:30]  Do you like some cream in your eye?  Cream in your eye.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  That is fantastic.  Oh, was that a, God damn funny show?  Why don't we take a break?  I knew you couldn't help being black, but why'd you go Jew?  He says, that's . . .  Want to take a little break?  Yeah, why not?  Because we got one of our favorite gay clips of all time to play for everybody. 
[01:28:00]  You want to hear what Rogan has to say about Fyga?  Yeah, I'm actually curious.  I'm actually really curious about that, too.  I hope he's not coming out of the closet.  That would scare me.  Oh, boy.  If Joe was ferociously gay.  Oh, my God.  He could just go around getting any ass he wanted by force.  You think his YouTube clip will change anyone's opinion?  Not mine.  Well, you haven't heard it yet.  Jesus, I have an open mind at least.  But he would have to pull some fucking Jedi mind shit on me to stop me from using any word I use. 
[01:28:30]  We know Joe a little bit, and I believe he thought just like we did about language.  So it's very interesting to see what he has to say about it.  That he doesn't use the word anymore.  All right.  We'll do it after the break.  But first, our favorite gay clip of all time.  So we'll do it in a couple of minutes.  Minutes.  Minutes.  So it's the great Norm MacDonald.  Oh, yes.  One time I was doing this thing in San Francisco, and they were all gay people in the audience, 
[01:29:00]  they told me.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade, and I saw in it there  were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of our gay son.  You know?  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know?  Because it's not an achievement, you know?  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that. 
[01:29:30]  And I just wondered, I just, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men  are actually bragging, you know, at work, like they're, hey, Bill, you know, my kid.  Oh, my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean?  And now he's articling over at a law firm, and, oh, yeah, he loves cock.  This kid. 
[01:30:00]  He can't get enough cock in his mouth, his ass, this kid's always cock.  I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's cock.  I want to show it to him.  You're going to be proud of him.  To watch the maturation of you as an artist, to realize it took you nine and a half minutes  to get around to the second cock stuff.  It's beautiful to see you comfortable in your own skin, Normie.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:30:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus, Sirius XM.  Happy birthday to Michael Jordan.  Thank you.  Love Michael Jordan.  Not so much with the Hitler mustache, but he's 48 today. 
[01:31:00]  48?  Happy birthday to you.  I guess he suited up recently with the Bobcats.  What's he doing that for?  And the player said he kept up with everybody on the court.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  At least Jordan.  And Larry the Cable Guy, 48 today.  Hey, where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  That thing's taking off, you know.  Oh, my God.  What's where we going?  Oh, when you were out last week, Bobby came in, and we decided to just create a whole new 
[01:31:30]  character for Bob Kelly based on Larry the Cable Guy because we, you know, everyone knows  Larry the Cable Guy was just a basic comedian and then came up with this character, which he  doesn't like talking about.  But then we found a YouTube clip of Larry the Cable Guy from back in the day where he's  just a regular comedian.  He's a regular guy.  Dan Whitney, yeah.  Yeah, so we told Bobby he needs to kind of start talking like a Southern comic, and  we need a catchphrase.  Gave him a name, Billy the Bassman.  Billy the Bassman.  Billy the Bassman.  And his catchphrase is, where are we going? 
[01:32:00]  So after every bad joke, he'd just go, hey, where are we going?  Where are we going?  Instead of, like, get her done.  Right.  It was, where are we going?  And fucking CokeLogic made a great little animation for it.  Yeah, if you go to our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, it's right there.  Very easy to click on, but CokeLogic did a great animation.  You're right, Ant.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  But it was about an hour.  And of course, the jokes had to be all one-liners that were just horrible.  But then you yell out, you know.  But if you yell out, where are we going? 
[01:32:30]  Then it kind of works.  Yeah.  And the joke sounds good.  I love the backdrop.  It's like a comedy special.  Is the audio worth playing?  I mean, the animation's terrific, but maybe a quick...  I mean, it's the bit.  Yeah, let's try it.  Let's just try it for Jimmy, because Jimmy's...  And if you go to the Facebook page, Opie and Anthony, you can watch it for yourself.  See, there's Billy the Bassman.  Ladies and gentlemen, your next comedian, we're going to bring on your headliner right now.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Billy the Bassman!  All right, Bobby, animation.  There you go, Billy!  There you go, Billy! 
[01:33:00]  There you go!  There you go!  All right, now, settle down.  I'll tell you where we're going to go to funny land.  Come on, now, settle down.  Now, I'm here.  It's all right.  Well, it's good to be here.  Where are we going, Billy?  Where are we going?  We're going right now.  We're going right now.  I'm going to tell you where we're going.  Where are we going is right.  I just opened my grandmother's house now.  She lives over here in Tennessee.  It's a funny thing with my grandmother, though.  She was born with two thumbs and one hand.  Two thumbs.  I took her to see a movie.  She gave it two thumbs up.  She liked it. 
[01:33:30]  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Yeah.  She worked for the Catholic Church on Ash Wednesday.  She did two people at a time.  Where are we going?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, now, you know, I got a couple questions for you here.  Sometimes I like to ask my audience a little questions and give them a little information you don't know now.  All right.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  I'll tell you where we're going right now.  We're going right at this joke.  Yeah, Billy. 
[01:34:00]  What do termites eat for breakfast?  What, Billy?  Oak meal.  Where are we going?  Oak meal.  Oak meal.  Yeah, God damn is right, now.  Where are we going?  Why was the chicken happy?  Everything was excellent.  He said excellent.  He didn't say excellent.  There we go.  All right, now, let me ask you another one now.  Let me ask you another one.  Let me ask you a question there, sir.  You're yelling out. 
[01:34:30]  Here we go.  What do a massage therapist eat for dinner?  What's that, Billy?  Spaghetti.  Where are we going?  Oh, no.  Where are we going?  Gosh dang.  Gosh dang.  All right, now, let me tell you this.  You know, I like those Chinese people.  Did you hear about the lookalike competition in China?  No.  Yeah, everybody won.  Yeah, they do.  They do.  Where are we going?  Same haircut.  Over and over.  Where are we going? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I love it.  All right, now, let's get back into some jokes here.  What do you say now?  Where are we going?  Come on, Billy.  What do flies wear on their feet?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Shoes.  Where are we going?  Thank you for coming out and seeing it.  Let me hear you.  Where are we going?  The best part is he's got to wear his where we going fishing hat.  He's got the hat.  He's got the fucking thing behind him that says where we're going. 
[01:35:30]  And a big backdrop.  It looks like a big banner.  It looks like he's doing, like, an HBO comedy special.  And he's got a big where are we going just hanging from behind him.  What we love about the bit, Jimmy, is the fact that the catchphrase is getting in the  way of everything.  Yeah.  Like, people just have to keep saying it.  They're going to have to yell it out.  Because you know when Larry the Cable Guy gets up there, people just start yelling out.  Get her done.  Get her done.  Get her done.  And he's like, yeah, get her done.  Get her done.  And he's got to deal with that shit. 
[01:36:00]  So the fucking, the animation brings it together.  That's for sure.  I thought that bit was stupid.  Oh, Chip.  It's just not good.  Why?  Do you have a catchphrase?  No, I don't.  But you shouldn't be making, you know, bad jokes.  Oh, I get it.  Shouldn't make bad jokes, Chip said.  Facebook, Opie and Anthony, if you want to see CokeLogic's great work.  Rich and Yonkers, what's up, buddy?  Oh, I was wondering if you were going to plug the video you put up a couple of days ago, 
[01:36:30]  the one narrated by Stacey Keech.  Oh, yeah, I tweeted that.  Is it on the Facebook page?  The guy took the Stacey Keech intro.  It's not up there yet?  What's wrong with you?  Oh, man, he should have put that up days ago.  Guy put a video together based on the Stacey Keech intro for the radio show,  and he did a great job.  There's literally like 200 fucking clips in this thing.  Oh, it is up there.  All right.  It's on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  The only reason I took your call, Rich,  I thought you were talking about the crackhead that did the backflip from the second story. 
[01:37:00]  Roof, did you see that one, Ant?  No.  Yeah, I saw that one.  Holy shit.  I tweeted late last night.  It's been making the rounds.  I think I'm late on this one, but I don't know if it was a bet.  Supposedly it was for a dollar or something.  And this guy, and it's not faked.  I looked at it a million fucking times.  If you can find it really fast.  Some kind of crackhead is on a roof two stories up,  and they're basically getting him to fucking do a backflip. 
[01:37:30]  And he does.  And it looks like his leg snapped in half.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You tweeted it?  I believe I did.  Oh.  It wouldn't be that far down.  Was he injured?  I don't think I tweeted much yesterday.  You don't see it?  Maybe I didn't tweet it?  Keep going up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.  I guess I didn't tweet it.  Fuck.  It's everywhere, though.  It's up on the Facebook.  That one?  The crackhead?  Okay.  Great.  Just look at this really fast.  You can see it for yourself on the Facebook page. 
[01:38:00]  Travis is trying to find it, which means...  Oh, there it is.  Come on.  I thought I tweeted this last night.  I guess...  I don't know.  Right?  Anything for a dollar.  Guy's climbing up on the roof.  Project's...  This shit crazy, man.  Project's backflips.  I don't know.  I'm crazy.  Off a two-story building.  I'm recording it, or he crazy.  We're going up on his roof thinking he's going to do a backwards flip up in the air.  Up in the air.  That's about 40, 50 feet in the air.  That's some up there. 
[01:38:30]  This is the ground going down.  That's more than two stories, man.  It's probably about 30 feet.  Watch this fucking thing.  I know it's radio, bro.  There's me again.  He's right on the end.  I pray for you, brother.  Please don't hurt yourself.  How about...  Don't do it.  This is Joseph Slutich at Baller.  He's just jumping off a roof.  What does he think?  The backflip is going to defy gravity? 
[01:39:00]  This is tough to watch.  I'm telling you.  Nah, it's really not.  He's standing there waiting.  Yeah, he's trying to...  There he goes.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck out of here.  You all right, bro?  Like a cat.  You sure?  Yeah.  He really bad at this fucking temple.  Where are we going?  And then it goes on and on, and they follow him, and he looks like he's pretty fucked up when he finally sits down. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, really?  But the ground is like that really hard, packed dirt that...  Oh, yeah, that are all around the projects.  Yeah, that serves like a driveway.  Yeah.  It wasn't even fucking, you know, a lot of crass.  He's limping pretty good.  Yeah, he had to have broke something, man.  And he did that for a dollar?  That's what they say.  Who the fuck knows?  Where you going, bro?  He had to shut the ball.  Bean ball.  Huh?  I'm going to the clinic.  Where you going? 
[01:40:00]  To the clinic.  I told him not to do that shit.  Anyone want a cheeseburger?  You all right?  Ain't nothing broke, is it?  No.  You sure?  Yeah, a little.  Someone's chow is running around.  That's my chow.  No, wait.  You put green...  Are you going to have me?  No.  He banged his fucking head when he landed pretty good. 
[01:40:30]  Thank God he hit his head.  You know, he's fine.  We'll be back at you, part three, man.  Can you imagine him?  How do you punch that guy?  Two thumbs up.  Two thumbs up, he gave.  God damn.  That's fucked up.  One a tick.  That guy, I know we'll all be talking about that.  Remember the time he jumped off the motherfucking roof?  I jumped off a five-story roof one time.  I did three somersaults, yeah.  Three somersaults?  Really?  Yeah.  Somersaults.  I landed on my one leg.  It was really cool.  Did you get hurt? 
[01:41:00]  No.  Oh, okay.  I bet it was a plug.  Everybody.  Yeah.  You were very popular that day.  Yeah.  Don't do it, Chip.  You're going to die.  I'm like, I'll save you.  I'll save you.  No one cares about Chip.  Oh.  He doesn't exist anymore.  No one cares about him.  Like, he doesn't have any friends to tell him to not jump off a roof, even if he did it.  But I think he's lying.  Jerry Sherbert did it.  Oh, right.  Your new name, Jerry Sherbert.  The fuck? 
[01:41:30]  I'm just coming apart mentally.  No, you're not.  You're fine.  What's wrong with you?  He's sleepy.  No, I'm not bad now.  I just...  Oh, really?  Do you feel like you're coming apart?  Yeah.  Do you?  Coming apart?  I really do.  You didn't hear him?  Says he's coming apart mentally.  Oh, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm losing my perspective.  Why?  I don't know.  Everything's going great for you.  You did Leno, Chelsea Handler, and then two days. 
[01:42:00]  I was very happy.  Did three fucking great comedy shows, or two or three of those.  Now you're going to Cincinnati.  What's going on with you?  I don't know.  I just don't know what's happening.  I don't know.  I'm dreading this trip because I'm gone for a while, which I hate being gone.  Yeah.  I'm used to coming back.  But if I came back from Cincinnati, it would be stupid.  It would be in the afternoon.  There was no morning flights, and then I would have to fucking go to L.A. the next day to  do this thing.  Yeah.  I didn't know we were off.  You're doing a thing in L.A.?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going for a couple of...  Do this thing.  All I ask, man, if you fucking get a thing, fucking just take us with you. 
[01:42:30]  That's all I ask.  Do this thing.  I don't want to be sitting here day after day rotting.  You're not enjoying it?  No.  Rotting?  Not at all.  See?  I told you.  I finally admitted it.  See?  I've been doing this since I was 18.  I need a fucking new...  A new something.  It's all right. 
[01:43:00]  Would you guys think less of me if you realized that I actually thought I was actually going  out there to try modeling?  But I wasn't being ironic.  Like, somebody told me that I had a nice smile, and I really went through rotting.  It's my dream deep down to model.  I could give you some pointers, man.  I looked good in a Coke t-shirt.  Don't show it, man.  No, are you sure?  That was just a quick little fucking reference.  I had to show it to my girlfriend.  Yeah, thanks.  Why are you falling apart?  It's not about me right now.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not terrible.  I'm okay.  I just feel like I'm just... 
[01:43:30]  Are you unraveling?  Yeah, I feel like things are just not making sense.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's the worst thing you could say.  Not sleeping properly and just kind of feeling a little frayed around the edges.  Yeah.  Like the threads are pulling and...  Last night, I'm just telling her, I'm like, something's wrong.  I don't know what.  Really?  I'm not angry enough of a bed.  I think we just need to shake some shit up.  This has been coming...  This is a little too mundane for me. 
[01:44:00]  I need to blow some shit up.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I need some big fucking media thing.  No, because even that...  But then the depression sets in after that.  No, I don't mean...  We just need to shake some shit up somehow.  That's all.  You're bumming out at all?  I don't know.  I wouldn't say bumming out.  He's unraveling.  Yeah.  Mentally.  Look at him.  You can see it in his face.  I don't feel terrible.  I just feel like something's off.  You know what I mean?  Like, terrible.  But I'm not mad.  I don't feel like... 
[01:44:30]  We'll go through those phases.  But you seem like you're in a good mood lately.  Yeah, it's not an anger thing.  It's not a...  It's just feeling like something is horribly wrong.  Are you sad?  I don't know.  Do you have distress?  Oh, no.  Are you distressed?  Are you panicky?  A little bit panicky.  A little panicky.  I feel a little panicky taking the trip.  I'm not nervous about the gigs.  I've done the gig.  It's a good gig.  Portland will be fine.  It's probably because things are going too well for you.  Possibly.  You have a problem when things are going too well for you.  I've noticed that over the years.  It's hard.  Do you have a thing?  Almost like you don't deserve it or something. 
[01:45:00]  I don't know what it is.  I'm not a psychologist.  Or a psychiatrist.  Do you have a thing you're working on?  He's got a thing.  Is there a thing?  He's working on a thing.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  I mean, I want to try something.  He's got a little thing.  A little thing.  He's going to be gone for a little while with his thing.  I got Bob working on my thing.  Very good.  Bob's working on my thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I got something that he's had to.  It was finally time for me to hand it off to him.  Like when you get something and then it's like, all right, this is now out of my league.  How do I ruin this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How do I ruin this? 
[01:45:30]  I had to hand it off to him.  It's like, okay, you deal with this.  I don't know.  A thing.  I love the things.  We all have to be involved with the thing.  But I've been working really hard on the thing.  There's no reason yet because no one has any interest in it.  No one is.  I don't know what I'm doing.  No, that's not true.  I mean, in a sense, I'm nervous.  You're pitching the thing.  I am pitching the thing.  So there's an interest?  No, no, no. 
[01:46:00]  To be pitching, no one has seen it.  So they have no interest until they see it.  But it's like if you pitch something and it doesn't go, then your work has been for nothing.  Right.  Wow.  Yeah.  But no, it wasn't.  It was.  It'll all be there.  So we're always afraid that you're going to be validated as like what you thought was good wasn't.  So it's easier to not take the risk.  And I find myself, you know, I don't sabotage things by like, you know, running through the room with a bat.  But I subtly will do that to myself. 
[01:46:30]  Like keep pushing it back and keep pushing it back.  And I'm like, I'm just afraid of fucking.  That's human nature.  Yeah.  That's not a surprise at all.  I think everybody does that.  It's bad, though, because it's pushed back too far and all of a sudden the moment passes.  Because you're leaving your comfort zone.  Yeah.  You know what you got right now.  So to push past that is very scary for just about everybody.  I like being comfortable.  Yeah, you like being comfy?  You do look like you're unraveling, though, now that I look at you.  I feel that way. 
[01:47:00]  I really do.  No, it's okay.  I do feel that way.  I don't see it at all.  I'm just fucking.  I just feel like high tension.  Really?  I had to go for my fucking stupid stress test yesterday.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  See?  You go to my heart guy.  Now that probably got you a little stressed.  Did you do a heart thing?  Yeah, a nuclear heart test.  And?  Well, I won't know for a few days.  They have to go over the results.  But you walk on a treadmill and they inject you.  You have an IV in when you're on the treadmill.  And they inject you with this nuclear material.  Yep.  And I mean, I just want to. 
[01:47:30]  I want to.  Were you breathing heavy?  Not that bad.  I mean, she said I was actually.  I did.  I did well.  Like, as far as.  Oh, you're good, then.  I was breathing heavy.  You would know.  On the final.  When they rev the treadmill up and you're going up a hill.  But even that, I was okay.  I wasn't terrified.  You're fine, then.  You have no blockage.  My fucking apnea sucks a dick.  Oh, really?  Because then you have to lay under this fucking thing.  And they take photos of your heart for five minutes and then 18 minutes.  So for 23 minutes.  And then.  And then you leave for a couple hours. 
[01:48:00]  And then you come back and do more pictures.  But I kept falling asleep on the table, which was nice that I could do that.  But my apnea, I kept waking up.  And I was like a fucking quarter inch under this thing.  It was really claustrophobic.  Oh.  But I couldn't sleep.  I hate my apnea.  Fucking.  Oh, God.  Sagat throat.  I hate it.  I just want to doze off on my back.  Oh, he's going for that breath.  Yeah.  You want a psychiatric nurse?  Sure.  Why not?  Who is this bitch? 
[01:48:30]  Let's say I'm a killer.  Kathy and me.  Kathy.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Kathy.  Welcome aboard, Kath.  Hi, guys.  Love you, cartoon.  Sorry.  Jesus.  You had to mention that.  You sleeping all right?  No, not really.  Yeah.  See, that's it.  I didn't hear a part about the cardiac test before I called.  Oh.  Well, you just did.  I think Jimmy has anxiety because he's getting his shit checked out, and it makes you wonder,  right?  Maybe, yeah.  That's part of it, probably.  Until you get the test results and everything's fine, which I believe will be. 
[01:49:00]  You're a little like, what the fuck?  My stomach's been acting weird, too.  Every time I go on the road, I've been feeling really queasy and shitting pure liquid.  Oh, no.  I'm like, what's wrong with me?  I have anxiety, Jim.  Maybe that's it, but I don't know.  Things are going too well for Jimmy.  You're an anxious little boy.  And he's uncomfortable with that.  You got it.  It's like Ope said, you got it made, and you know, give Ope a break.  Made in the shade.  No, I don't feel like things are going too well.  I feel like I'm running on it.  Like, I hate to say running in place. 
[01:49:30]  I feel like...  How can you say that?  Because you have to...  Look at all the great stuff you've had in the last year.  You're a regular on Leno.  Now you're pretty much becoming a regular on Chelsea Handler.  That's some good shit.  All that stuff is great stuff, and it's fun stuff, but it's...  What is it?  When you look at who is...  Like, when you look at guys that are successful, like really...  The people we compare ourselves to are our peers.  You know what I mean?  It's like you see guys doing really good things, and it's like, I don't want to just be doing  things...  You're not happy with the mediocrity of our lives? 
[01:50:00]  I'm happy.  I love the game.  I don't want to leave radio.  I love doing radio.  Yeah.  And I love doing Leno, and I love doing Chelsea, but I kind of want to have something  that I do that's fucking, like, I'm not on somebody's dick.  That's Jim Norton.  Yeah, because you feel like, you know, I'm always relying on other people, and it's like,  I don't always want to rely on other people.  It's like you fucking...  You start to feel like, what are you doing, you coward fucking...  You know what I mean?  I start getting mad at myself.  Stop waiting for other people.  Well, it's not like you're...  This is good, because it's not like you're just not doing anything.  You are.  You're trying to do things. 
[01:50:30]  You're working on a lot of things, you know, to get out of that.  Which is good.  People that just sit on their ass, and they're like, oh, whoosh, this, that, and don't do  anything.  That's the problem.  Yeah, I know, but I just, you know, I'm happy with the other stuff.  You know what?  I'm bored with this conversation.  Wow.  I'm bored with this shit.  No, but it's...  Wow.  No, but you understand.  It's this fucking...  He's hoping his heart out.  I'm looking at, like, ten feet of snow all around me.  I'm running my dog. 
[01:51:00]  No, I'm not bored.  You know, I know.  I don't feel bad about myself in the sense, like, I don't work.  I know I work hard.  I know that, and believe me, I love the fact that the segments on Leno are going pretty  well.  You're uncomfortable with your success, because you think it's just going to all go away or  something.  I'm uncomfortable with it, because I'm not happy with the level of it.  Like, I'm happy where I am now.  Will you ever be happy, though?  Sure.  Sure.  What will make you happy in the biz?  In the business.  I don't...  It's an indescribable thing, but it's when you...  Would it be having, um... 
[01:51:30]  Because, I mean, being a regular on Leno is pretty huge.  That would make a lot of us fucking happy, obviously.  What if you had your own show?  Possibly, yeah.  Own TV show.  Look at a guy like Louie.  He's a good example of a guy.  If you had what Louie's got kind of right now, or something similar, let's say, because  you're different people, would you shut the fuck up?  No, the thing was, Louie's a good example of a guy who had a bunch of things that didn't  go, but he's driven and he does what he does, and then all of a sudden, whatever  it was, his head kind of poked above. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that happens, and it's an indescribable thing, because before Dane got to be the level  of Dane, and I'm not saying I want to sell arenas out, Dane was fucking very well known  before he sold arenas.  Like, Dane was doing 3,000 seats.  Dane didn't just go from fucking 50-seat comedy club to 17,000, but he was lurking below  that level for a long time.  So was Chappelle.  I remember Chappelle for years was getting pilots and they weren't getting picked up.  He was right there, right there, and then they poked their head above.  I like how you explain that, poking your head above. 
[01:52:30]  I can understand that.  Yeah, there's all of a sudden something happened.  We used to call it clicking up a notch.  Yeah.  But everyone...  Like, you can't describe it, but you knew it was happening.  Everyone is just waiting, because they know you're going to poke your head up any moment  now.  Possible.  It's all just been kind of like, you know, brewing for you.  It's happened for like, Rogan's at that point, because the UFC all of a sudden, like,  he's now...  He poked his head up.  Yeah.  It's like, and that just happens, because people knew who he was.  He had Fear Factory.  He had so many things.  But all of a sudden, this UFC gig just kind of put him on that next...  And then one day, you just poke your head up. 
[01:53:00]  I get it.  It just happens, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's going to happen, though.  But you have to...  It has to be something that you kind of make happen.  So if you had your own TV show?  If I was happy with it, yeah, sure.  Not someone else's show that you're in.  You're...  Even with somebody else's show that I was in that I was happy with my stuff in, yeah.  But my show I would prefer to have where you like what you're doing, and you feel good  about it.  It doesn't have to be on fucking CBS.  I'm not saying that.  Right.  The stuff I've written is kind of...  You know, it's harsh.  Some of the language is harsh.  I don't expect it to be on network TV. 
[01:53:30]  So it's not about the biggest audience.  Yeah, like FX.  Or there's a million...  That's one thing.  It's like, there's the language barriers that Rescue Me started...  Lifetime.  I would love to do something in Lifetime called Kiss This, and it's a picture of my knuckle  on the poster.  She Got Lippy, a mini-series.  Yeah.  I'm sure everybody has those moments in their jobs, though, where you just...  Not that I'm not grateful.  I love it.  My apartment's paid.  Like, I have a great life.  I'm very grateful.  Is it because you're changing? 
[01:54:00]  No, I don't think so.  Menopause?  No, my act is the same.  I'm fucking...  When you decide to change your life, it's really scary.  Because everyone knows their comfort zone, even if that comfort zone is hell on earth.  At least you know what it is.  And when you try to, like, move on and change yourself, it's fucking scary, man.  Yeah.  You almost feel like you don't know yourself.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's why I think most people just don't want to change.  Because they're comfortable with what they have.  Yeah.  They understand it. 
[01:54:30]  Even though they know there's probably a better life for them.  Yeah.  And every time I've expanded the comfort zone, whether it's coming into New York...  That's scary, man.  But it always, all of a sudden, feels better.  Like, all of a sudden, it just becomes part of your comfort zone.  Right.  It's like, you know, it's like chick talk, but it's fucking...  Whatever.  I've just been bothered for a while.  Like, my act, I'm very happy with the way it goes on stage.  The crowd likes it.  I feel like I've always been writing, but then a part of me just hates my own guts on stage.  Like, I shouldn't say that before plugging gigs, but, you know...  Yeah, it's going to be another fucking sad show in Cincinnati this weekend. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yes.  Modeling.  Throw antidepressants on stage for Jimmy.  Oh, shit.  No, I don't feel necessarily depressed.  Just like, a little nervous, frightened.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Kathy, you added a lot.  I really appreciate your phone call.  Yeah, thanks, Doc.  Just amazing stuff.  You should have your own TV show on OWN.  It's just...  Yeah, right.  It's going to happen for you.  Expect a bill, huh?  Holy shit.  Wow.  Yes, Kathy?  Free advice.  This is just unbelievable. 
[01:55:30]  You got a...  This is going to sound really gay, but you got a...  Hey, hey.  Don't say that, man.  The fag is going to get pissed off.  Gay.  You've got a great support system with those two.  Sure.  You really do.  No, it's awesome.  With who?  Just what you got with you.  Oh, really?  We don't support each other.  Don't listen to what you just said.  We used to, and it used to be fun and cool.  Jesus.  Listen to what you just said to each other.  What did they say?  Go ahead, Doc.  No, I'm not saying nothing.  Hey.  I'm listening.  It's a listening show for me. 
[01:56:00]  It's almost like meeting a lot of celebrities is a lot of fun, and I really do love it, but  you realize what a nobody you are when as many people as I've met that I liked had no  idea who I was.  It's like, after a while, the evidence is in.  It's not a low self-esteem thing.  It's just, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  That's where you're crazy.  But no, dude.  I mean, I'm telling you.  Dude, I've been with you 10 years, man.  We can't even walk around anymore without people recognizing you.  No, no.  Fans doing stuff like that.  I know.  No, man.  Because it used to be like we got recognized because of the radio show.  Now you get recognized.  I don't get recognized because they know you from other places now.  A lot of other places.  I know.  You've poked your head up a little bit.  I guess I'm just tired of being a fanboy.  Your head is almost completely above water.  You're poking.  Oh, I'm tired of being a fanboy?  A part of me, yeah. 
[01:57:00]  You're poking, sir.  You're poking.  You're turtling.  You're turtling.  You're just about ready to fucking pop.  Prairie dogging.  You're prairie dogging.  No, I just, you know, whatever.  I mean, I'm not in a fucking depressed place.  I'm just, you know.  Yeah.  I just noticed that.  Kathy, will you add something?  Yeah, Kathy, what?  I'm just listening and enjoying it.  But, you know.  Enjoying a man's misery?  Great.  Yeah, but I'm not miserable.  I'm just in a weird, like, eh.  You're miserable.  Yeah.  I'm sitting here.  Teasing of course.  I'm sitting here looking.  I'm sitting here looking at the snow.  I'm up in Maine, and I'm, you know, it's the greatest life. 
[01:57:30]  And listening to you, Jimmy, you do have it made, but I can see where that little  poking depression pops in or that little bit of what you're questioning, who you are.  It is.  Who am I?  What do I want?  You are completely useless.  No, I'm not saying that, Kathy.  I'm saying I kind of know what I want.  Who am I?  I'm a mediocre man.  What do I want?  There's no need.  Better things.  No need to call him Jimmy Watley.  Yeah.  Come on.  No, I'm not that bad. 
[01:58:00]  All right.  I'm going to go to sleep.  I worked all night.  I love you guys.  All right, Kathy.  I've had too many relative comparisons.  That's the problem.  You have too many fucking...  Is that it?  Yeah, because again, doing shows with people and meeting them is great.  And I get pictures, because a lot of times I get good.  Oh, I fucking humiliated myself again on the fucking plane going out to LA.  Uh-oh.  Not humiliated, but embarrassed myself.  Even when people do recognize me.  Oh, no.  Who's the Black Eyed Peas guy?  Will?  No, not the Black guy. 
[01:58:30]  It's the Asian guy with the long hair.  Oh, yeah.  You told me.  Were you mad that I never wrote back because I couldn't care less?  Oh, no.  I just realized that.  No.  Jimmy was excited and texted me that he was on the plane with a Black Eyed Peas.  And I realized I never wrote you back.  That's fine.  I'm sorry.  I should have wrote you back.  I'm pleased.  We took the flight, and one of the Black Eyed Peas was on the flight with his manager.  Yes, that's him.  And at the end of the flight, the manager said to me, hey, man, I really like your stuff. 
[01:59:00]  I'm like, oh, thanks.  And then the guy, Taboo.  Taboo.  I didn't even know his name.  Oh, Taboo.  That's Taboo.  Taboo.  He shakes.  Right before the plane is ready to descend, he comes over to my seat.  And he goes, hey, man, I really like your stuff.  We shake hands.  We go, oh, hello.  How are you?  Whatever.  So as we're all getting off the plane a little while later, the manager invites me to the  show. 
[01:59:30]  They're doing the show that night, the Thursday.  He's like, hey, they're doing this thing with John Legend if you want to come.  Fuck, that's cool.  And I'm like, yeah.  So the manager has me call his number so we have each other's numbers.  And I'm like, I do want to get a photo with this guy.  I'm like, you know, I wasn't really going to, but I'm like, when I watched the way the  flight attendants were fawning over him, they never fucking act like that.  I'm like, this guy, this is the Super Bowl.  It's a massive band.  Why not?  So he's like, you don't have to play.  I'm like, yeah, fuck it.  I'll ask him.  He won't have a problem with it.  But then it's taken him a while to come off the plane. 
[02:00:00]  And I realize it's because he's stopping to take a bunch of pictures.  But then, so when he comes off the plane, I've actually just been standing outside for  like 10 minutes waiting.  Oh, boy.  Outside the area.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he comes over.  I'm like, hey, I hate to be a fanboy.  I want to take a photo.  He goes, yeah, let's do it.  So we took the photo.  But then they walked away.  I was just embarrassed because I kind of blew it.  But then they walk away.  You did what Opie did with Obama. 
[02:00:30]  Obama.  I thought of that.  That's what I can't look at.  But then it's worse.  Then it's worse because I went in and go to the bathroom.  Oh, no.  I went to go to the bathroom and I come out and I'm like, I want some Starbucks.  So I'm walking and I realize I'm walking towards the wrong way towards baggage claim.  I'm walking towards baggage claim.  I'm walking the wrong way.  I went the wrong way.  And then I see a Starbucks.  So I go, oh, this is the wrong way.  And I turn around and come back.  But they turn around and come back.  I realize that Taboo and his manager are coming out of the Starbucks.  So they probably thought I was looking for them. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, no.  And then saw them and then was turning around to walk with them.  And I was like, oh.  And I actually went and got a coffee I didn't want.  Just so they wouldn't think that.  I couldn't.  I was so humiliated because I knew that they thought I was looking for them.  Do you think they're like, oh, Jesus.  This guy won't fucking stop them.  Yeah, but then I never heard from the manager to come to the show.  Oh, no.  I didn't hear from the manager.  Oh, Jimmy.  I didn't blame him, though.  Yeah, you would have been a problem.  They probably were like, oh, this guy's just going to be a problem. 
[02:01:30]  He's a fan.  And he's going to be annoying.  Like a big, annoying fan.  And, oh.  I love it.  Wow, that is a horrible story.  I know.  I'm such a dick.  I'm such a dick.  So what does Forgi like?  I kept thinking of Forgi.  Forgi.  What is Forgi like?  I was so embarrassed.  The worst part was waiting.  If he had just walked off the plane, I grabbed the photo. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  But the embarrassing part was that I had to wait because I realized he was taking pictures.  And he knew while you were standing there.  Of course he did.  And then by the Starbucks, it's like, oh, he's following us?  He's a fucking stalker.  Oh, and then I saw them again.  Oh, no.  No way.  Yes.  Then when we walked out, we got my Lagage.  And we walked out.  And they're ahead of us crossing.  If you go over to LAX and you cross the two little streets to get to the parking garage, 
[02:02:30]  I was thinking of the airport in the country.  And they're on the little island in between.  And he sees me coming and he raises his coffee like, you know.  Hey.  Hey.  You know, we click cups.  And then I was like, we were just walking across the street together.  So I was just asking him about how do you do a gig when you fly?  Because I hate to do a gig the night I fly.  Because I think, you know.  It was actually a normal thing, I said.  But I think the manager got a little creeped out that I was walking across the street.  Here he is again.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:03:00]  I should have just said hi.  Yeah, yeah.  You should have just said hi and left it at that.  Hey, thanks.  Be the cool guy.  I know.  Be like the guy that just goes, hey, thanks, man.  Yeah.  I like your stuff, too.  Hey.  Good job.  I'm a sap.  But you're like picture.  I know.  Hi.  I'm a fucking Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  You got to get a picture with Justin Bieber.  I do.  He's the hottest entertainer in the fucking world right now.  No, he is actually in Lady Gaga.  I don't understand it, but you got to get the picture at least. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Although, can I say, I can't.  And Lady Gaga is going to be around for a long time.  Bieber, shelf life, two years tops.  Maybe.  That picture is going to be nothing in a few years.  Unless he acts.  He ain't going to do the Justin Timberlake thing.  I had this whole discussion with him during the last break.  Done.  He's not going to be able to cross over.  No, he might be right.  Most of those guys go away.  Timberlake was able to figure it out.  And he's pretty much the only one in recent memory that went boy band to something else.  Not the Biebs.  I'm just like, what am I doing waiting for a photo of a 16-year-old who doesn't know who I am? 
[02:04:00]  Like, what the fuck am I doing?  Who cares if he knows who you are?  But the point is.  I could care less, but I would get the picture.  Why?  Like, Ozzy or Sabbath or Kiss mean something to me, so that's different.  You know what I mean?  When people mean something to you, you should be a fan of weight.  Yeah.  But I'm standing there nervous and trying to just coordinate to get a photo of this.  Like, what the fuck am I doing?  And I know it's going to be kind of a funny photo.  Like, I kind of know that people who know me, they're just the juxtaposing of us two  is kind of funny for people who know me.  But how did you tweet it? 
[02:04:30]  I didn't tweet it yet.  Tweet it with a funny line.  Me and Rachel Maddow.  I'm obsessed with that.  That is funny.  Yeah, I know.  He does look like him.  All right, can we take a break?  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy's falling apart.  It's very obvious.  You'll see it for yourself if you go to this show at the Funny Bone in Cincinnati.  Yeah, because you certainly won't be going to see me in the Montclair, Wildmont Theater  in Jersey, will you?  Oh, boy.  It's going to be another failed endeavor.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  Just done. 
[02:05:00]  Patrice tweeted something really funny about, I miscalculated and had to come out of retirement  or something like that.  Yeah, that is the funniest.  He was talking about that.  He miscalculated.  I had a long talk with him the other day, actually.  And he, yeah.  I go, I thought you were retired.  He goes, I miscalculated.  I'm like, how do you miscalculate after a month into retirement?  Usually people say that 10 years in and go, oh, fuck, I got to get a little job for myself.  Not a month in.  That might be a little depression on his part, too.  Thank you.  Me, too, yeah.  Just get out there. 
[02:05:30]  No, I'm just feeling the same thing I'm feeling.  It's tough to go on the road weekend after weekend.  And the money's good, dude.  It's like, I'm not crying poverty.  It's like, that's why I don't mind booking a bunch of gigs.  I make good money.  I would love to hit the road.  But you guys have been doing it for so long.  But for me, I would love to check out the country.  I love it when I'm on stage and I'm doing great in Austin.  Or this gig is good.  I've done this gig before.  The crowds are great.  It really is fun.  It's not like I'm saying that.  But sometimes the routine of travel and the fucking shit, it does annoy you after a while. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  And it's like, you're not just selling out all the shows.  And I'm like, I just, what am I doing?  You start to think that way.  It's like, what am I doing?  I don't sell out in advance.  You're going to see, like you see other people that are like, everywhere they go, it's sold  out.  And I'm not talking about massive levels.  I don't need like Dane or Louie or Aziz and Zari who's doing it or Kevin Hart.  Those guys are whatever.  I don't need that.  But it's like when you just want to, you want to go clean in a 1500 seat theater.  It's like, yeah.  Or a fucking comedy club. 
[02:06:30]  You really do stuff.  Patrice, I'm sure, understands that exactly.  I'm sure all those guys do.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Hey, man, while you were babbling, I just tweeted a great picture.  Jesus.  It really is a great picture.  I tweeted it.  OP Radio on Twitter.  But look at this.  It was when Shane Mosley was in.  But it was from his photographer at the door.  And we're all turning around.  It's a solid shot.  Let me see it.  Oh, look at that.  Isn't that cool?  Yeah, that is.  He captured the whole room.  Very panoramic.  Panoramic. 
[02:07:00]  And we're all turning around, I think, because his trainer was talking at the time, which you  don't see in the shot.  But the Nazim.  Yes.  You want that picture?  I love that.  That's a great shot, dude.  He was frightening, by the way.  That's like a weird fisheye lens type of photo.  That's fantastic.  It really is a great picture.  Now, Brother Nazim enjoyed the show.  He had a good time, and so did Shane.  They were great.  Yeah.  They were very nice guys.  Shane's going to get his ass kicked.  I hope not.  No one was brave enough to say that.  He did, and he looked like he wasn't, but he was actually having fun with the show.  Yeah, I know.  He was laughing.  He was enjoying himself.  I hope he doesn't.  I hope Sugar Shane could take him out. 
[02:07:30]  I know.  He was such a nice dude.  Yeah, Danny's in it.  You get me, Sam on a camera in the background, Jimmy, Anthony, Shane, and Danny.  That is odd.  We're all looking in the same place.  That is so odd.  He really captured something in that picture.  The interesting thing is-  Most of my pictures don't mean shit, but this one's good, man.  I think the important thing is my apparent weight loss in that photo is what we should  all be talking about, and it hasn't been raised yet, but I do think-  No, it hasn't been.  Wonderful. 
[02:08:00]  I do think.  I'm juicing.  Are you juicing?  Oh, yeah.  Steroids?  Steroids, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Some steroids.  Oh, yeah.  Are you juicing with a juicer?  I go to my juice place.  Oh, okay.  I'm becoming very-  I think I had a juicer.  I'm becoming very earthy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Earthy.  Just putting dirt in there.  You got it?  Kind of dirt juice.  He's a worm.  I need dirt juice.  Dude, you joke.  Dirt juice.  This one juice drink, it tastes like grass clippings.  I'm like, why am I doing this? 
[02:08:30]  To live maybe two years more?  On the bad end of it?  On the bad end, exactly.  Who cares?  What am I doing?  If you could pick the last two years.  The peanut butter one looks delicious.  All right, 22.  Let me pick that.  It tastes like grass clippings.  I'm not even going for-  It's horrible.  But it's not like I'm not trying to lose a certain amount of weight.  I'm just trying to tone down.  Tone up.  Tone down.  Tone up a little bit.  All right, we're going to break.  I see photos of myself, and I'm kind of happy with some of the weight loss. 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  Did you really lose weight?  I did.  Of course you did.  Congratulations.  I can see it in his face.  Yay.  How can you see?  The whole face is falling apart.  Oh, look.  He's falling apart at the seams.  Two equals in the airport.  Oh, there.  That's the famous picture.  Can I see it?  You look so happy to be there.  And then after that, you just-  You've practiced your picture look.  I can tell.  Follow them around.  Yeah, it's called Be Retarded.  Repeat.  All right, when we get back, we got a Michigan news reporter getting tased. 
[02:09:30]  Great story.  What?  And then that senator, Scott Brown, basically admitting he took a cock up his hiney.  I thought he was going to be a presidential timber.  But after revealing that, I don't know.  You can't reveal that shit if you're going to possibly have a chance at the presidency.  Clinton revealed being beaten as a kid.  Yeah, he can.  Well, beaten's one thing.  That's true.  Getting a dick in your ass or one in your mouth.  Yeah, maybe it wasn't in his ass.  People think that might come back to him while he's having a crisis.  That might affect him.  I don't understand these people that really want great book sales. 
[02:10:00]  Who are these people?  He has a book out.  So he figured, I got to pull a story out of my ass to get the numbers up.  Hello!  I know.  What?  You think when they put him in the coffin to make him up, they'll put those eyebrows on him?  Oh, boy.  Those penciled eyebrows.  Uncle Leo.  Uncle Leo's dead.  Uncle Leo.  He had a good life.  Seinfeld.  Seinfeld guy.  This guy from Seinfeld.  You know him.  He was one of the greatest fucking characters on television. 
[02:10:30]  That guy was hysterical.  What was his contract?  Jerry.  What did he make it to?  What did he make it to?  88 or something?  88?  That's nice.  Not bad.  I'd take 88.  T-A-B-O-O?  He looked angry because she painted the fucking eyebrows all angry.  The fucking premises of some of those shows are just out of fucking bounds.  All right. 
[02:11:00]  Can we break now?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do that.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  V.A. 3.  Motovirus.  Sirius XM.  All right. 
[02:11:30]  What were we going to do?  Oh, the Michigan News reporter?  We're going to do that.  I don't know this one.  Where's Joe Rogan faggot thing?  You want that?  Yeah.  I'd like to know why he's not going to use the word faggot anymore.  I think it's a long YouTube clip.  It's like eight or nine minutes.  Jeez, Joe, you're being a faggot.  I'm kidding, of course.  You're stoned.  I hope it's not because all of a sudden he had an experience that he...  Oh, that he wants to talk about.  I hope this clip doesn't start with, you know, I was in a men's room recently. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, no.  This clip isn't going to start.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  Let's take a listen.  Do we need to set this up?  No.  No.  Joe Rogan is coming out of the closet.  We're just confused by language.  We're all about just fucking let it...  Yeah, I don't care.  Let it just be, man.  In the words of the Beatles, just let it be.  Let it be, let it be.  Let it be, let it be.  What are we trying to do?  We're all different and we like to fucking point that out. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Mother Mary would come in.  Yeah, speaking words of wisdom.  Yeah.  A lot of wisdom.  Even though it didn't help him because he was like, I have this problem.  This, it's just standing up by itself.  She said, let it be.  They wanted to grab it and tug it until white goop came out.  Until little beetle maker came out.  And then she would just, she would wet her finger with her tongue and rub the helmet  and just go, let it be.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Why weren't the Beatles able to make other Beatles? 
[02:13:00]  Meaning their kids.  Their kids just don't have much talent.  Tough act to follow.  Yeah.  Sure.  Although I think Sean Lennon could have a massive career if he wasn't influenced by  Yoko's strangeness.  Did the daughter, did Paul's daughter go into like photography or something like the other?  Stella.  Stella's a designer.  She's actually, she's actually kind of a beetle.  Yeah.  In that field, but for the most part, man, the Beatles didn't make Beatles.  What about Ringo's son?  What about him? 
[02:13:30]  Exactly.  He's in exactly.  That band.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  You ever see Sean Lennon though?  In person?  No.  Holy shit.  He looks just like John Lennon.  Honestly, I should shut up.  He's really talented.  Really?  But he has the Yoko nonsense that he's been heavily influenced by.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Like he sounds like he could have a million pop songs.  He got a little more of the Asian in him.  He sounds like his father.  Can we find a, I don't even know what, I couldn't name you one Sean Lennon song and that's kind 
[02:14:00]  of sad because I think he's way more talented than that.  That it should have been on our radar by now.  What song would you play by Sean Lennon if someone said, play me Sean Lennon?  Probably don't sign that, dad.  Oh shit.  Do we even have a Sean Lennon song in the system?  I saw him in Central Park part of the summer stage one year and I was like, holy shit,  this guy's fucking talented.  You sure it wasn't Joe DeRosa?  He looks like Joe.  Oh wow.  You have anything, E-Rock? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, we have a couple, but none that anybody recognizes here.  What would Sirius XM, uh...  There's a song called Dead Meat.  I have no idea.  All right, let's play it real fast.  Or a taste.  See?  Already.  Did you hear that Yoko shit?  Yeah.  This is Yoko shit.  Sounds like, yeah, sounds like a carnival ride or some shit.  Dead Meat. 
[02:15:00]  Dead Meat.  Don't you know you're Dead Meat?  You just messed with the wrong team.  Better not try and fall asleep.  He sounds like a lesbian.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, this is...  He's ripping off John Lennon.  You hear the voice though, right?  Give me another one.  Give me another one.  That one's a little too high. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, he's got like...  He's got a high voice.  This one is called Wait For Me.  This is good.  All right.  Please don't ask me why  But true as the sky  Everyone is born to die  Very Lennon.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not bad. 
[02:16:00]  I just don't know why he would sing a song about his father.  Dead Meat?  Oh, God.  It's really...  I don't know why he would do that.  You hear the John Lennon though?  Am I mistaken or what?  Of course.  But then it's Yoko shit in there.  I thought Vladimir.  He sounds just like him.  It's a history joke.  He's a Lennon grad.  That's what they said when he was graduating high school. 
[02:16:30]  Lennon grad.  All right, Chip.  I got you.  All right.  Iraq, you're going to play it all day.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Iraq, don't put your middle finger up.  Oh, shit.  He can do whatever he wants.  I don't give a fuck.  Oh, shit.  I'm becoming earthy, man.  That was just the finger he was up to licking.  Why are you making it?  Poor kid.  I know.  He hasn't shaved in four weeks.  I like that.  He's in a horrible depression. 
[02:17:00]  Is everyone bumming?  Is everyone a little bummed?  I'm in a good fucking place, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, because I know this shit is over.  Oh, God.  So I'm just riding it out, man.  It's a great place to be.  Andy Dufraining.  We're all at that final step.  It's a great place to be.  I'll tell you right now.  What are all the steps of going through something?  Oh, acceptance.  Yeah, I think we're all at acceptance.  Oh, absolutely.  Acceptance.  This place has become a dead end, unfortunately.  A dead end.  It really has.  It's a cul-de-sac. 
[02:17:30]  We're still on the road, but I mean, you know, it said dead end.  Yeah, yeah.  Just waiting for, you know.  For that guardrail and the diamond-shaped fucking sign.  I just hope when we get to the end of the dead end, there's a way to turn the car around.  I don't want to back all the way up.  No.  Fuck yeah, man.  This dead end.  They did it.  They did it to us.  You know, congratulations.  I certainly will not be re-signed.  The place can just beat you down.  I'll tell you that.  It's about time to say that.  I will not under these circumstances.  There's no fucking way. 
[02:18:00]  No way.  The place has a way of just beating you down, doesn't it?  Now people know.  I mean, you know what?  We got a year and a half or so?  Probably a little more than that, right?  A year and 12 months.  There's no fucking way.  A year and 12 months.  Yeah, wait.  Just give me a minute, so.  A minute.  A minute, so.  What do you think of the Sean Lennon, though?  You hear the John Lennon influence, right?  Oh, sure. 
[02:18:30]  I guess he's decided he doesn't want to be, you know, mainstream, you know, popular.  Whatever.  Yeah.  He's okay.  And then you had the other one, Julian.  What's he doing?  What is he doing?  He had that one song.  What was the big song?  Oh, right, right, right.  I forgot the name of it.  Everyone thought he was.  Party Hard?  Party Hard.  Him and Andrew W.K. did it?  Yes.  What was his big song?  My Mother Sucks.  Jesus, Jimmy, we're all falling apart because of you.  Her fucking yelling. 
[02:19:00]  Much Too Late for Goodbyes.  What a s-  Oh, that's actually-  Much Too Late for Goodbyes.  That's not a bad song.  That's an okay song.  This is-  That picture of him is enragingly smug.  This song, you know who he always confused me with is Sean Penn's brother.  And that song.  Fucking-  Chris?  No, he has-  Sean Penn's got a brother that was a singer, right?  Oh, uh, Michael. 
[02:19:30]  Michael Penn.  Yes.  Oh, Bic.  He had that one.  Bic.  Is that Julian?  Yeah, he sounds just like his father.  He looks old.  He is.  God, how old is he?  I've been wanting to die, but it's much too late.  What year was this?  I'd say 88.  8.  Yeah.  Earlier?  80- 
[02:20:00]  86?  I know this shit from what stupid radio station I was at.  Julian's 47?  I don't know.  86, 84, 84.  They're saying about 84?  84.  1953.  1953.  Someone's way off on that one.  1926.  Jordan writes, Opie's getting earthy, E-Rock's getting girthy.  Oh, no.  Chip is getting murthy. 
[02:20:30]  Some funny.  All right, where are we?  Oh, there you go.  Where was it?  84.  84 was the correct-  84.  Wow.  That was-  Hey, look, everyone was still so sad about John's death.  They're like, oh, my God, this is the next John, and that's probably why this song  was more popular than it would have been.  Yeah.  It was poppy.  It sounded like-  It had a little poppy song.  Yep.  Technically 85, because it was released UK 84.  Stay tuned.  It's an okay song.  He's got to be still making music.  He has to be.  Joan Rivers just walked by.  Oh. 
[02:21:00]  Why the fuck doesn't she do our show?  She's fine.  I think she's being loyal.  She feels like-  What?  I don't know if it's a Howard show.  Is it Howard?  I don't know if it's because of-  Loyalty?  Yeah, that's got to be.  What are people going to have loyalty for our fucking show?  We tried getting her, apparently.  We did?  Yeah, she only does-  She's just one of his guys.  We're a big fan of her fucking documentary.  Get her in here.  There's a loyalty thing going on, yeah.  Is there?  Definitely.  Definitely.  She doesn't want to pull another Carson.  Yeah, exactly.  She doesn't know loyalty. 
[02:21:30]  Whatsoever.  She learned.  She learned her lesson.  Yeah.  I know Julian has to be still making music, because what are you going to do if you're  John Lennon's son?  So, I need to hear his latest fucking song.  Yeah, what is it?  There is none in here.  What?  Well, but he's still making music.  He's coming out.  He's recording now.  Lennon's sixth album, Everything Changes, is complete and will be released in early 2011.  Oh.  So, where's the song?  They're mastering it. 
[02:22:00]  Massive.  All right.  This Lennon break's going nowhere.  Let's talk to Joe Rogan here through the magic of radio.  So, Rogan, kind of surprised us, said that he doesn't use the word faggot anymore, but  some people say that he kind of uses fag on his podcast.  So, now I'm very confused where he's at.  Yeah.  But he decided to, you know, go on record about the word.  He does his podcast.  I've never heard this before.  Let's take a listen.  Let's take a listen.  Let's watch this podcast last night.  Couple highlights.  Ladies and gentlemen, I retired the word faggot from my vernacular.  Sorry to hear that, Joe. 
[02:22:30]  I gave it up.  I gave it up in light of this most recent controversy where I called this guy a faggot.  Not meaning anything derogatory towards homosexuals, but, you know, there's this, the thought behind  saying something like that as well.  What's important is not the word.  It's not a magic word.  It's your intent.  And that should be important.  But when there's a word that confuses a lot of people and pisses people off and that's  not your intent, then really rationally and logically you have to kind of accept that  you have an ineffective word. 
[02:23:00]  That word's not that good.  That word means too many different things.  It means to, to some people, it means you hate gay people.  And that is the furthest, furthest possible thing from the truth.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Where did he call somebody a faggot though?  Where was it on stage or?  I probably, we'll have to ask him.  Yeah.  Was it a faggot?  I think people are trying to make us, uh, think that you hate gay people because you  use that word when growing up, we just didn't know. 
[02:23:30]  We just, we didn't use it that way.  Oh, he called a journalist a faggot.  Is that what happened?  Did he?  All right.  There was more, there's a little more here.  So by me conveying any homophobic, you know, any, any, not intent, but people receiving  that and getting that message that I'm homophobic because I call somebody a faggot.  Like it doesn't mean that with straight guys, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't mean that  the reality is if it's making that many people pissed off and upset and it's making them  think that you care about their sexual preference. 
[02:24:00]  It's like, I, at a point in time, I was like, why am I attached to this fucking word?  Like, am I just stubborn?  Like what?  I mean, it's fun to say.  It is fun to say, but why is it fun to say?  It's fun to say because you're not really supposed to say it.  Same reason fig Newtons are nice to say.  It just sounds good.  Right.  Faggot.  Yeah.  But I just decided from all this that it was an ineffective word and then I didn't want  to be hurting anybody's feelings for no reason at all.  I'm hurting absolutely the wrong people's feelings.  Like I don't care at all about the fact that they're gay. 
[02:24:30]  And if that hurts their feelings, if it's just this one word, it's like, it's enough.  Who gives a shit?  But it's not just that one word.  That's the problem.  See, I understand what Joe's saying here, but I don't agree with what he's saying and why  he's saying it and why he's dropping this word.  I don't agree with it at all.  To me, he's not even making sense because it hurts a few people because they misinterpret  how you're saying it and it's not that important a word.  You could just drop it from your vocabulary. 
[02:25:00]  Then every word that can be interpreted as negative to somebody, you have to drop.  Rogan can't just drop faggot.  He's got to drop everything.  The weird thing is like I notice, I say it less on stage because I noticed it's like  it feels uncomfortable.  It really does because you know there's people feel there's a greater implication.  I said it last night at the cellar for something.  I'm faggot.  And I do use it when I feel it's necessary. 
[02:25:30]  There's one punchline I'll never take it out of because it just destroys and it belongs  there.  Yeah.  But like words like that or nigger, it's like, I guess the key with those words is  not to drop them totally, but if you're going to use them, look, unfortunately, the way  society is going, these words are making the audience completely uncomfortable.  And I don't mean you should pander to the audience, but if you use them, just make sure  you're using them effectively and where you want to use them.  Like I do every time coming out of the Midtown Tom and usually by my exit. 
[02:26:00]  No, but you don't say it's like if you're going to use the word like where it makes sense  and it's like, that's the word you got to use.  That's fine.  Yeah.  But I'm careful with it because I know I can get away with it in front of the audience  that come to see me.  I know that.  But it's like if it's not necessary, it's not doing anything.  I agree with him as part about certain things being ineffective words, but I would, there's  no words I've dropped and I use, I don't think you should refrain from using any word  if the context is right. 
[02:26:30]  Does that make any sense?  Yeah, it sort of does.  Like, but, but him saying it's an ineffective word, what did he mean by that?  I think what he means is when you're on stage, right?  Like, and I'll tell you why I used it.  I don't, I attack male bloggers and pundits and sportscasters when I talk about Tiger and  I talk about the way they reacted to Mel Gibson.  Yeah.  And the way I would say it, the way I want to say it is when did men in this country become  such fucking faggots?  Which is perfect.  That has nothing to do with sexuality. 
[02:27:00]  I agree.  Not at all.  And it's a great word in that context and it's angry.  And I mean it angry because I'm attacking these self-righteous men who threw Tiger under  the bus when they understood it, but pretended they didn't.  But the reason I don't say faggots there anymore is not because I got flack for it.  No one said, Joe, we're going to protest you.  But I, it's like, look, you know, 20 years, you get perceptive to the, you feel, it's  distracting.  It's distracting and not necessary because at the point I'm not making, that's just a  word I'm throwing out out of anger.  It could be pussies or just buckets. 
[02:27:30]  I'm just smashing these guys.  Faggot is not necessary there.  When a word becomes distracting to the audience and it's not helping you or necessary.  That's like if I said, uh, like I quote Mel Gibson sometimes when he said, uh, you're  going to get raped by a pack of niggers.  And there's times where I'm uncomfortable doing that joke because this black guy's right  up front.  I don't feel like I'm going to get beat up, but I feel like the implication for the audience,  but I have to quote it accurately when I do it.  But so this isn't, uh, something, this morality that you've come up with, this is completely 
[02:28:00]  self-serving for your act.  You feel like it, it makes the audience uncomfortable.  That's not your job.  I don't mind making them uncomfortable.  Let me say that.  But in the right, in the right way.  Right.  Not, not because you're using a word that some people are going to be like, uh, uh, you  know, you, you make them uncomfortable the second you walk on stage.  But it's, it's just, uh, what Joe is saying is he wants to get rid of it for his, for this 
[02:28:30]  obligation to gay people.  Well, I think he feels like, well, Joe, I mean, me and Joe are not saying things are that  different.  I think Joe is feeling like he's saying it and it's not conveying the intent and what  he wants.  And I think what he's saying is the word has become so associated just with gays.  I mean, maybe it always was.  Maybe that's why it was an insult when you were a kid, but I think what he's saying  is like, look, it's not the message I'm trying to convey.  So it's, it's, it's just, I understand that part of it being distracting. 
[02:29:00]  Uh, if I'm trying to say something like if I'm saying that what I'm saying about male  bloggers and all that stuff is I'm saying that they're cowards and they're dishonest  pussies and they're liars.  That's the real intent of what I'm saying.  But if the word faggots just feels good coming out and is an aggressive, angry word, great.  It sounds right, but it's distracting and it's, it doesn't matter.  It's, it's not the message I'm trying to convey.  Does that make any sense?  It's not even self-serving.  It's distracting.  Some people read into it and just see the word faggot and miss your point completely. 
[02:29:30]  What, what, what bothers me about this whole thing is these victories.  It, uh, something Ann said many years ago, they don't stop there.  Yeah.  And the ball, uh, the ball or the rock seems to, it's starting to roll down the hill and  it's going to, it's going to get faster and faster.  And it just gobbles up words.  You're going to, it's going to gobble up a lot of words because then, oh, look what we  got done with, uh, the word faggot and then, uh, then lesbians got to go and then, I don't  know.  I'm just throwing it.  Right, right, right.  But it's just going to keep going and going.  That's why I think you have to kind of fight for this. 
[02:30:00]  Well, that's why you have to fight for this.  I agree.  And people as individuals, that's why I don't make a determination for, I'm not being self-righteous.  Like I, I still say faggot on stage or I'll say nigger.  If the context is right, I don't do it to be shocking or to be the guy who can get away  with it.  Right.  You're saying two different things and it makes sense.  Like you, you don't want these words being banned, but in your, in your world and in your  situation on stage, it doesn't feel as right at times.  You'll edit it yourself.  I use it when I need to.  Right, when you need to.  But not gratuitously when it's not needed because it doesn't mean anything that way. 
[02:30:30]  It's like being a little boy just yelling.  It's, it's almost like if there's a joke where you're talking about, sometimes the word  vagina will be funnier in a joke and make more sense than the word cunt.  Right.  Um, it's simply what works on stage, but it's not saying I don't say faggot because  I do and I don't want the word banned.  I don't judge other people for, I don't care if people use it.  Yeah.  It's just certain times, you know, you have to do what makes sense for you as a performer  and, uh, the entire audience being uncomfortable by something doesn't mean that you shouldn't 
[02:31:00]  do it.  Mm-hmm.  But if it's at a time where it's not the message you're trying to convey, it's like, why,  you know what I mean?  It's almost like if, uh, when I talk about, like, I like a big pussy and I do all that  stuff.  If I just said, I really like a girl with a big cunt, at times, it might make, you know,  again, ONA crowds would laugh at that.  But a lot of times you do that, the word cunt would be so jarring.  Yeah, that it takes away from what you're actually saying, which is funny anyway.  It makes the bit less silly.  Right.  The words, I mean, obviously comics, but they're living on their words. 
[02:31:30]  So you have to pick and choose what you say in any, any joke.  But that's, but I think what you're saying is completely different than what Rogan is  saying.  Maybe, but I think Rogan is saying that, but he's saying his intent is not to be offending  gays when he's saying it.  And I think Rogan also knows too, that in a way he represents UFC and you represent this  group of guys who are seen as these alpha male ass kickers.  So if you're there going, Hey faggot, it just, I don't know if that's what he's saying,  but to me, it's like, that's not what he's trying to convey. 
[02:32:00]  He's not trying to go, Hey, you, you like to fuck with other men.  So you're right.  And he's afraid that it's just coming off that way.  And it's like, it's not worth it.  I mean, if he wants to make that decision, I'm not going to be like, yeah, Rogan, fuck  him.  I'm not listening anymore.  Yeah.  Obviously it's his choice.  I just don't agree.  I don't agree with it.  Well, we got one more clip from Joe Rogan.  Also he says, I'm kidding faggot.  Yeah.  Right.  And then he blows Ari.  Ari in the big fucking subway commercial.  I took notice. 
[02:32:30]  I didn't notice that.  Good for him.  Ari getting a big hit national TV spot.  Good.  Good.  Edge FM Sal on Twitter.  A word shouldn't hurt any man that can take another man's dick.  I know it's kind of accurate.  That's really fucking funny, man.  Feelings are hurt.  Are they?  Wow.  And Bill in Texas, he says, Oh, quit being a crybaby.  If you don't like it, get a real job.  Well, first of all, I still do like doing the radio show.  So you misunderstood what I was saying.  And if I did leave after the end of this contract, I'd never have to work another day in my life, asshole. 
[02:33:00]  So I will not be getting a real job.  I do.  That's right.  Bill in Texas.  I have to work.  I did all the shit jobs before I got on the radio, but I'm at a point I don't have to work ever again.  Douchebag.  I do.  Here's Joe Rogan and a little more on faggot.  But isn't it something just more about somebody just being way too sensitive?  Yes, it is.  It is.  Like there's sensitive straight people and sensitive gay people.  I know a lot of gay people.  You say the faggot in front of them.  They don't give a shit.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  For sure and true. 
[02:33:30]  But it's not like they're saying don't swear at all.  You know what I'm saying?  It's not like they're saying you don't call people cunts or douchebags or any other word that means exactly the same thing.  You call some guy a faggot.  This guy's being a faggot.  What do you mean?  He's being a douchebag.  It's really the exact same intent.  Yeah, but if somebody says lardass in front of me or fatso, I won't get offended by fatso.  But that's descriptive.  Yeah.  So is faggots.  But it's not.  It's confusing.  It has an ambivalent sort of meaning now.  It could mean pussy. 
[02:34:00]  It could mean douchebag.  It's too confusing.  And Louis C.K. has a great bit about it where he kind of defends his use of it.  And every comic friend I know says it.  And Ari and Joey, when they got me my birthday cake for my 40th birthday, it says, happy birthday, faggot.  That's not my birthday cake.  Because we call each other faggots all the time.  It's like someone like Brian might call me and go, hello, faggot.  You know, just out of nowhere.  That's actually the better one that I usually say.  You know, he's trying to explain it.  It's hard to explain, I think.  Yeah.  If you're a guy just growing up, it's really just hard to explain. 
[02:34:30]  Because I never thought of it that way.  He did explain a douchebag.  And when he said that, it does sound the same way.  I understood that to a point.  But I never used it like that.  And it's used like a douchebag, dummy, idiot, faggot.  Happy birthday, faggot.  That's hilarious.  That's something anyone would do for their friend.  But the thing is, the problem with gays and with any special interest or any group that  feels they're being victimized is the, we can use it, but you, like, the thing that 
[02:35:00]  bothers me is the queer stuff, queer eye for the straight, like, I've used that before.  That, to me, it's like, you can't all of a sudden in one breath say, well, we understand  the intent of queer.  See, because queer, you're fucking queer, is an ugly word when you're kicking somebody's  teeth in.  Yeah, exactly.  So don't sit there and think that if gay people are using it, it's like, well, we understand  the intent of it here, because that's the same as going, I understand the intent of it  if Ann calls me a faggot, if I call Danny a faggot, or like Joe said on his cake. 
[02:35:30]  Like, so that's that self-righteous shit that people get into, like, like, gays are now  falling into it.  Stop telling people.  When you become preachy about stuff like that, you really lose a lot of people.  Yeah.  And then, as a comedian, your job is almost to rebel against that shit.  Like, the language restrictions.  Like, I didn't really care about nappy-headed hoes until they fucking dumped Imas.  I didn't care about that word.  And I didn't care that Snoop had fucking girls on a leash at the MTV Awards until I heard  him being hypocritical.  And then you have to attack people for that. 
[02:36:00]  Right.  And I don't understand that group.  Perez Hilton.  Sorry, Perez Hilton.  I never called the black eyed peas a guy a faggot, and then it turns out he did when he  was mad.  Right, right.  So he fucking lied, and he used this.  So he understood that fucking slur.  I don't understand how a group is victimized because you're using that word when they use  the word themselves, like you said.  Right.  And then what kind of words are they using to describe other groups?  Yeah.  Everyone does it, but we don't want to acknowledge that.  Yeah.  The nappy-headed hoes are saying some fucking, some shit.  Yeah.  Most times, people's offense.  The key for me, and this is my own personal line, is weeding out when I think offense makes 
[02:36:30]  sense, and when I think it's self-righteous, or I think it's attention-seeking, or I think  it's just nitpicking and becoming self-important.  Yeah.  And then there's times where certain things I think are offensive, and I try to not use  them in certain contexts, because I'm not an idiot.  I mean, I do live in society.  Right.  You know what I mean?  I mean, again, Carlin is a great example.  He used nigger in an amazing bit about Prior and Eddie Murphy.  It was hilarious the way he used it. 
[02:37:00]  But George Carlin didn't say nigger every other joke.  No.  He didn't, whenever he talked about black or white issues, he didn't say nigger women.  He didn't overuse it and fucking do it because he was George and he could.  He would use those words selectively when they meant something.  And he was great at describing words and their intent and picking them apart.  I mean, he was the master.  So obviously, that guy could have used any word in the right context in his act.  And I don't, I don't say the n-word.  I really don't. 
[02:37:30]  No.  Not perfect, but I don't really say it.  Well, yeah, when it's, but I mean, no, but that's where I'm at.  I just don't say it.  I have to or my family will disown me.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, George using the word faggot, very rare would he use that in anger.  He expresses anger so well.  It's almost like you don't want to use certain words that are distracting to the audience as  an unnecessary crush because no one could fucking carve your stomach out better than Carlin.  Nobody.  He didn't just say, oh, guys are all faggots who like this.  He dissected them.  There are certain words I'll stop using when people stop being them. 
[02:38:00]  That's when I'll stop using them.  And, you know, growing up as a closed-minded white kid on Long Island, when we used, like  said, stop being a fag and stuff, if you truly thought he was a faggot, trust me, you wouldn't  be hanging out with him.  Yeah, yeah.  True.  I mean, I'm talking about my old self.  I try to be more open-minded.  Oh, I love faggots.  I know plenty of them.  I try to be more open-minded, but that's, right?  Oh.  You were scared shitless if you really thought someone was a quote of whatever. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  You know, proving that we were just using the word.  I don't think I ever called my pal Richard a faggot.  That would have offended him.  Not in that way.  But no, because, you know, he wasn't being a faggot.  He was being gay.  He wasn't being a faggot.  But, which is, you know, you laugh, but it's true.  He was being a cocksucker.  Yes.  He was a friend of mine, and, you know, he wasn't being a faggot.  He was being gay. 
[02:39:00]  Do we have the Carlin bit?  Is he chewing or talking back to us?  Oh, my God.  You look at the picture on the screen.  His mouth's moving.  Iraq, I swear to God, I didn't know if you were chewing or talking back.  No, I was looking at Danny.  I said I was looking for the bit.  All right, because I think it's a good one.  Also, someone is saying that Sean Lennon did Across the Universe, and it's on YouTube.  I don't know.  If it's worth playing, Danny, you know, use your discretion or whatever. 
[02:39:30]  Use your judgment.  I'm trying to prove to these people that fucking Sean Lennon could be really talented.  Yeah.  If he just would stop living with Mommy enough already.  Every time I see Yoko, Sean's with her.  Yeah.  I said, the other day, I saw her at a department store, and they're just always together.  Enough with the Mommy.  Yeah.  Do you hang out with your Mommy that much?  All the parties and things, events.  Would you walk around the city with Mommy?  Never! 
[02:40:00]  Then again, Dad wasn't shot.  Yeah, that's true.  Maybe you kind of latch on a little bit to the remaining parent.  Yeah, I guess.  Or maybe he hates her so much, he just wants to be there when she dies.  Watch it happen.  Rogan's take.  Yeah, let's...  It was interesting, though.  I mean, I could listen to that for a couple of minutes.  Yeah, absolutely.  He's highly intelligent.  I like the Rogan.  I was watching some of his podcasts last night.  You know who else has a podcast that... 
[02:40:30]  A webcast that I was watching that...  For some reason, I can't not watch it, yet it is probably one of the worst things I've  ever seen.  You know that couple that did those Hyundai commercials during Christmas?  Yeah.  With that crazy-looking, singing broad, pumple moose.  Yeah, sure.  They do a webcast, I guess, once a week, for half an hour, and it is...  It looks like a bit... 
[02:41:00]  I watch this thing going, this cannot be real.  These people cannot honestly be this bad at doing this.  It's so bad.  Are podcast videos...  Are they usually...  Is Joe's a video?  Yeah.  Joe's video, yeah.  Joe uses, like, three cameras in the same room.  It's starting to look good.  So there are three people on three separate parts of the screen.  So it looks like they're sitting in a circle.  So instead of just having one camera at a distance on three people on a circle, it's  three faces. 
[02:41:30]  So that's kind of a cool thing that Joe did with his.  But these two, they sing little songs and put hats on and answer questions, and they're  such hipsters, and just, like, San Francisco fucking...  There's a market for that.  I don't know.  Liberal...  Never understood it, but...  Well, I don't know.  It's so fucked up.  You watch it, though.  Because it intrigues you.  It is so bad.  Yes.  I'm captivated by its hardness.  Someone said that they're back on TV again, too, with another commercial.  I haven't seen it yet.  Really?  I haven't seen it.  The holiday commercial that drove us all nuts. 
[02:42:00]  Not the one that sang holiday.  The other one.  Yeah, yeah.  The Pampa...  The Pampa...  Christmas.  The Pampa...  The Pampa Moose.  Yeah, whatever.  I guess there's a new commercial that's going to drive us nuts.  Really?  Unless the guy on Twitter last night was, you know, just talking out of his asshole.  The blowing shit out of his ass.  Right.  Yeah.  All right, what do you want to do?  You want to do the Sean Lennon?  What do you want to do?  Which way you want to go?  Which way you want to go?  Let's see.  Could you just humor me with the Sean Lennon doing across the universe?  Sean Lennon across the universe. 
[02:42:30]  Rufus Moby and Sean Lennon.  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  That's not Sean.  That's not Sean.  It's kind of pompous, that, to start the song when you've got the guy's son on stage. 
[02:43:00]  I know.  What the fuck?  Yeah, Rufus.  Wainwright.  It's way bigger than Sean.  I get it.  Yeah.  You're right there.  Nothing's gonna change my world. 
[02:43:30]  Nothing's gonna change my world.  Is Sean gonna do a part?  He's singing.  It's Rufus.  Nothing's gonna change my world.  All right.  Another verse.  Big of Moby.  Images of broken light which dance before me like...  Does Moby enrage you?  Yes.  He enrages me.  I keep waiting for him to pull me over for a meeting at the elevator.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:44:00]  Stupid bald head.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wait pause this.  Pause.  I'm talking about Moby.  Moby looks like Gary.  Oh, see?  That's exactly what we were.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He looks like a lesbian. 
[02:44:30]  Sean?  Yeah.  It doesn't sound bad, but he's not singing really bad.  He's just harmonizing.  Yeah.  You think he gets the next verse?  I don't know. 
[02:45:00]  What the hell's going on here?  Oh, they're turned with my gun for the harmony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  It's a good fucking tune, man.  Holy shit.  It's a great song.  It's a great song.  It's a great song. 
[02:45:30]  Moby's low harmony is a little annoying.  I don't know.  I kind of...  I kind of like it.  It fits in, but it's just fitting.  Pauses.  Pausing.  They ought to say, Moby, he should get a job here working under Steve Blatter and for  us and Rob Cross. 
[02:46:00]  Holy shit.  Cincinnati, huh?  Is Sean going to sing by himself, or this is a complete waste of time?  I think it's just fine.  I actually like Moby in this.  With that deep voice?  Yeah, I don't know why.  All right.  Another one that looks like Rachel Maddow. 
[02:46:30]  Sean Lennon.  Very good.  Nothing's going to change my world.  Those are big shoes to fill.  Yeah.  Big glasses to fill.  And poor George Harrison's son has a big hat to fill.  No surprise, but a listener suggestion failed again.  I like that, dude.  I'm not sure you're going to go get it on iTunes and make love to another man.  We're trying to show people that Sean Lennon could sing. 
[02:47:00]  He was just harmonizing there.  And then you had Moby.  I like him in that, though.  Once there was a girl.  That was all over the same thing with the low harmony.  It was all over Guns N' Roses, Use Your Illusion 1 and 2, from the guy who sang in Crash  Das Dummies.  The mmm guy.  Really?  The mmm guy?  Yeah.  If you pump it up really loud, you could hear there's someone underneath all the vocals.  Well, not all of them, but on a lot of songs.  And it's that guy.  Wow, damn.  I didn't even know this.  Yeah.  What song?  I told you that.  Lots.  One that's especially notable is Locomotive off Use Your Illusion 2. 
[02:47:30]  You could hear him a lot in that one.  What about Yesterday?  I did not know that.  He's all over the album.  Yesterday could be my favorite song on Use Your Illusion.  How's it going?  I think that was...  Yesterday.  Yesterday's...  Yesterday's, right.  Shit.  Give us a little Yesterday's going on.  I think that might have been one.  We're not really doing it.  I got a shit now.  I can't remember.  Just a little of that.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to go to break with this.  Yeah, too.  We might even play the whole fucking thing.  Fuck it. 
[02:48:00]  Jimmy's at the Funny Bone in Cincinnati this weekend.  Let's not forget.  We'll finish the show up next.  Stay there.  Yesterday.  There were so many things I was never told.  Now that I'm starting to learn.  I feel I'm growing old.  Because yesterday's got nothing for me.  My old pictures that I'll always see.  Time just page the pages in my book of memories.  I'll keep on moving along with no time to play at my feet. 
[02:48:30]  Because yesterday's got nothing for me.  Oh, pictures that I'll always see.  Some things could be better.  If we don't just let them be.  Oh, yesterday's got nothing for me.  Oh, yesterday's got nothing for me. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yesterday's got nothing for me.  Yeah.  Oh, yesterday's got nothing for me.  Oh, yesterday's got nothing for me.  Yesterday, there were so many things I was never shown 
[02:49:30]  Suddenly this time I found, I'm on the streets and I'm all alone  Yesterday's got nothing for me, oh, big films that I'll always see  I ain't got time to reminisce on novelties 
[02:50:00]  Oh, yesterday's got nothing for me  Yesterday, oh, got nothing for me  Yesterday, got nothing for me

[02:51:00]  O.P. and Anthony  On the virus  Sirius XM  I have to ask the audience something before I forget  Something that captures audio and video  What's good?  I use Audacity but I keep forgetting how to use it on my Mac  Captures it from what?  Like YouTube  I just bought a program  It's like $29 
[02:51:30]  I can't remember  It's on my Mac at home though  Is it good to capture?  It's great  I pop on YouTube and other videos  And then when you put your mouse over the video  A little tab up top says Download  And you just click on it and you can convert it to whatever format you want  It works very well  I'll text it to you when I get home  I want Ellen's version  I want Lady Gaga's version of Speechless on Ellen
