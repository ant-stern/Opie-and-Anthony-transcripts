<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between planned segments and listener calls.  The show began with a discussion of their "Two-For-Tuesday" format and Opie's upcoming golf lesson with Boris, prompting reminiscences about his past jobs and a funny story about a golf outing with Rich Voss involving a sandwich competition between their wives.  A listener question about a famous photo of construction workers led to a discussion about the Rockefeller Center GE building.  A caller, "Rape Kid" from Harlem, contributed humorous anecdotes.

The show then shifted to a detailed, often crude, dissection of a Raw episode featuring Shaq as guest host.  The hosts and producer Sam heavily critiqued Shaq's appearance and performance, along with other wrestlers like Chris Jericho and The Big Show, punctuated by numerous sexual innuendos.  They debated whether Shaq's appearance was genuine or promotional.  A significant portion focused on speculation about which NFL team would sign Michael Vick, focusing on teams with "bad" reputations (Raiders, Cowboys, Bengals) versus "good" ones (49ers, Colts), generating jokes about NFL fan bases and team reputations.  The Michael Vick discussion continued throughout the show.

The next segment opened with a morbidly humorous discussion about a deceased pet named Chester, followed by a debate about racial diversity at Arizona Cardinals games and the demographics of St. Louis.  The hosts and callers compared the severity of Michael Vick's dog fighting conviction to Dante Stallworth's drunk driving manslaughter charges.  A list of "worst team names" was presented (Santa Cruz Banana Slugs, Long Beach State Dirtbags).  The show then previewed the next day's guests: Brooke Hogan, Kelly, and Michael Emerson,  followed by *Lost* speculation based on a geek convention trailer.  A caller shared a news report comparing public outrage over Michael Vick's actions to that over a rape conviction, prompting a discussion about public responses to different crimes and the impact of Sarah McLachlan's ASPCA commercials.  A considerable portion was dedicated to a contentious debate about SiriusXM's Coffeehouse channel's music selection, with playful competition between the hosts and sexually charged banter involving the phrase "put it in my [dirty/greasy] shitter."

A heavily vulgar and sexually explicit segment followed, revolving around "White Ghetto Films" and graphic descriptions of their content, particularly involving elderly women.  The hosts then moved to sexually explicit commentary on pictures from WWTDD.com, focusing on Miranda Kerr, with numerous offensive remarks.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the show's explicit nature.  A backstage interview with comedian Bobby Lee resulted in an on-air panic attack and an awkward elevator interview.  The segment also included discussion of an article about Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr, along with additional explicit commentary, listener calls, and unrelated news items like a 911 call and Obama's beer summit.

The final segment began with a discussion of O'Doul's beer, escalating into homophobic slurs.  A call from Carl about his work on the V-22 Osprey aircraft was followed by a discussion about beer preferences and Brewtopia.  The hosts recounted their past interactions with Jim Cook (Sam Adams), detailing how their association negatively impacted his career.  A phone call with Cook, seemingly under duress, was played.  A call with Jim the Trucker revealed details about Silverton's trans mayor, prompting numerous transphobic comments. An update from Jim Norton on a movie set was played.  The hosts returned to Miranda Kerr, with Anthony showcasing his extensive picture collection.  The Michael Jackson death investigation and Dr. Murray's potential culpability were discussed.  "This Day in History" segments mentioned Mel Gibson's rant, the final Regis and Kathie Lee show, and Judy Garland.  A caller, Footer, shared a concerning encounter with suspicious men, prompting a discussion about similar experiences.  The show concluded with discussions of wrestling, Miranda Kerr, the Naked Cowboy, a plus-size dating show ("More to Love"), a fictional Andy Rooney commercial, a caller recounting a home invasion with a dog killing, further discussion of the mayor, and interactions with Sam and Wendy Williams. The broadcast also featured numerous "instant feedbacker of the day" awards,  a phone interview with Sandy Kane (the "Naked Cowgirl"),  discussion of the Naked Cowboy's life, YouTube videos, and ongoing banter about the appearance of various women using derogatory terms.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Welcome to this Two-For-Tuesday.  Ah, two-fers.  We should really fuck everyone up and just do two-fers all morning long.  How would we do that, though, with the talk show?  Would we talk for like ten minutes and then play it again?  That's what I mean. Just do two-fers all morning long.  And then it would be fun for the listeners.  What time would they go, all right, dicks, knock it off.  We get it. We get it.  The first couple of two-fers were cool, but now this is ridiculous. 
[00:00:30]  I think they do that like the first minute.  Oh, you think?  They give us no...  We got no slack.  Give us a little slack, man.  I don't even want to be here today.  I got a golf lesson.  A golf lesson?  I'm obsessed. I don't know what happened, but just out of nowhere I decided to be obsessed with golf again.  Yeah, you totally picked it up now again.  Once a week I play now.  I used to shoot in the, uh, ah, safe to say mid-80s. 
[00:01:00]  Sometimes I get a little lower.  Nothing spectacular.  Believe me, to a lot of people, that's spectacular.  Yeah, but I've only had two jobs in my life.  I've been in radio.  Prostitution.  And prostitution.  And sometimes golf.  And I was a caddy.  That's it.  That's all I know.  That's all I know is how to put a good radio show together, and I know how to golf.  I don't think I've ever legitimately shot under 100.  For real?  Yeah, yeah.  I think when I've played, like, for real, no mulligans, no bullshit. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, but you could be pretty good.  I've never broke 100.  You could be pretty good.  If I practiced, if I played a lot, but I go out maybe, like, twice a year.  And I love doing it.  It's just, I don't know.  That was me for many years, but for some reason, this is the summer of golf with me.  I'm obsessed, and I just need to play a lot now.  And I got this guy, Boris, who's listening right now, who's giving me a golf lesson today.  Boris.  Boris.  And so you train with Boris, so you can play with Boring, Rich Voss.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:02:00]  No, you know what?  Rich on a golf course is a lot of fun.  Is he really?  We crack each other up.  We're just a bunch of assholes to each other.  What's the difference from the show, then?  Just being assholes to each other.  Yeah, good point.  And he makes sure his wife packs me a little sandwich.  Which he's a great golf partner.  And then I brought my own energy bar.  You know, you bring those dumb energy bars to get you through a round or whatever, or whatever you're doing during the day.  And I pull out my energy bar, and he got all upset.  He goes, but I packed you an energy bar. 
[00:02:30]  And he's serious, right?  He's such an ass.  Why?  I don't know why he does this.  It's awkward.  It's so not the rich like we know from here, though.  And then I had to explain, because my wife made me a sandwich.  You two are like children.  This is what I'm getting at.  Did she call you in before you left, like, hey, Greg, Greg?  Right, right. 
[00:03:00]  You forgot your lunch.  Oh, okay.  She knew.  Got your cap on backwards.  Well, I mean, you know, we have very easy lives, trust me.  We know that.  But the problem with our lives is the hours suck.  So when you do the morning show, and then you want to continue your day, I have a tough time doing it.  Other people, they go, well, stop bitching.  I get up at five, and I don't stop working until – I understand.  Trust me.  I understand.  I'm not trying to say that, you know, that I have it tougher than you.  But me, I need to, like, do a quick power nap after the show. 
[00:03:30]  Then I'm good for the day.  But sometimes you go right from the radio show, and you have something cool to do, like play golf.  So I go home, and my wife – I hate saying my wife.  I just don't like that.  You know what?  It's weird to hear you say that.  I don't like that.  It's usually my chick or lens or just something instead of my wife.  I like being – I really like being married.  I just don't – I never liked that word ever.  The old ball and chain.  That's what I like calling her.  I think you ruined it for me. 
[00:04:00]  I know.  Exactly.  Every time I heard you say wife, it was like, oh, boy.  It turned into my ugh.  My ugh.  My ugh.  My ugh.  My ugh.  So she made me a nice sandwich knowing I'm going from the radio show, jumping in the car,  driving an hour because I had to play all the way down near Rich last time, which is an  hour away in Jersey.  So I had a nice sandwich on the way down as I'm driving.  Perfect, right?  Yeah.  So I get there and we're about three or four holes in and he gets all excited. 
[00:04:30]  He's like, Bonnie packed you a sandwich too.  And he pulls it out and I'm looking at it and I'm like, oh, that's really nice, Rich.  And I'm like, you know what?  Can I – I'm going to save the sandwich for after the round because now I have to drive  back to New York and it will be kind of my dinner.  Yeah.  And he got all bummed and then he grabs it and he goes, all right, but I'll keep it cold  for you.  And he puts it back into the –  Oh, it's a little cooler thing.  He's got like a little – it can only be described as a fanny pack on ice.  It's like this big. 
[00:05:00]  It literally holds two sandwiches and a couple juice boxes.  I've never heard a man talk about golf and have it sound gayer.  It's amazing.  You know what?  It definitely is a bit gay.  It just sounds gay.  I'm sure it's fine, you two, just playing golf.  But this – especially Rich.  Yeah.  Like it just sounds incredibly gay.  Well, my girl explained he's used – he has kids.  He's up to three kids or something.  So I think he has that in his brain to just take care of people around him, whether it's 
[00:05:30]  his kids or –  Nurturing and fatherly.  Or an adult shock jock with a horrible handicap.  Whose sandwich was better, by the way?  You know what?  Really.  You know what?  Bonnie's sandwich.  Do you know what?  What was Bonnie's sandwich?  You put a little onions on a sandwich.  Really?  It was like turkey, Swiss, and then you put just a little onions, chopped up onions on  there and a little mustard.  I was like, damn, that brings the whole taste together.  I've got to remember that one.  That does sound pretty good. 
[00:06:00]  And then what did the wife make?  What did she make?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You remember Bonnie's sandwich, but not the wife's.  See, I could be funny.  Oh, no.  It's golf day.  I'm psyched.  You didn't tell me what sandwich you made.  I don't remember.  You know?  Come on.  It had to be something.  Oh, okay.  It was underwood deviled ham.  No.  It was buffalo chicken.  Oh, okay.  I think it was some Swiss cheese in there. 
[00:06:30]  I think she threw some avocado on there.  Have you had avocado on a sandwich yet?  I'm a ham and Swiss on a roll kind of guy.  I understand.  You're one of those construction workers.  Yeah, yeah.  Sitting on an I-beam.  Yeah.  High above the city being constructed.  I remember when the Empire State Building was being built.  Sitting on a beam.  Yeah, with my lunch pail next to me.  50 stories up over Manhattan.  Throwing rivets at each other.  There it is.  Thank you, Danny.  Throwing rivets at each other.  You know, that famous picture. 
[00:07:00]  This might be a little too local.  I've been wanting to know forever.  What building is that?  It's got to either be the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building.  But that looks like Central Park is too close in the background.  Well, it could be the Chrysler Building.  So I'm thinking it's like Central Park South, a few in, right?  And then I look around and I'm like, what building is this?  Does anyone know?  It's the famous picture where they're all just hanging out on the beam,  eating lunch and shit.  That had to be a stage shot, by the way. 
[00:07:30]  No one would eat lunch like that.  11 guys on an I-beam high above the city with Central Park behind them.  And they're eating their lunch.  I always wanted to know what building.  I don't think it's staged or anything because I don't think they had Photoshop back then.  Oh, good point.  Yeah, but don't you think for a photo opto.  I just got a nasty look from Travis.  Don't you think for a photo opto they all said, all right, get on the beam.  That's crazy, by the way.  Oh, like get on the beam and we'll take a picture.  Yeah, I think it's like, I don't think they do that every day.  Dude, just looking at it and it's a black and white picture. 
[00:08:00]  I'm getting the heebie-jeebies.  Yes, absolutely.  That is a scary prospect.  Those two guys just leaning over.  What are they, lighting each other's cigarette or something?  Of course, it's a lucky.  Or maybe they're...  No Negroes on this I-beam.  Maybe they're gay for each other.  Look at those two on the left.  Rich Voss's ancestor offering this guy a sandwich.  Oh, Kevin from Connecticut.  Opie's wife made raccoon food. 
[00:08:30]  Yes, of course, feeding the raccoons.  And Kent the movie guy.  That's funny, Opie, because later I have a golf lesson with Moose and Squaddle.  Moose and Squaddle.  They're Boris and Natasha.  Boris seems cool.  I'm going to meet Boris for the first time.  A huge fan of the show.  He's a golf pro.  And he offered me and my bro a fine day at the golf course.  Dude, that's in off of Central Park.  Yeah, now I see.  That could be the Chrysler building then.  It could even be the Empire State Building.  No, you'd see the Chrysler building.  No, that's too many blocks.  I think it's Chrysler.  Because the Empire State Building, we've lived here off and on our whole lives. 
[00:09:00]  What is 33rd?  I always forget.  36th?  Is it 36th, a little higher?  30.  I forget.  Whatever.  Fourth?  So that can't be...  31, 32, 33, 34, 34.  Uh, Danny.  What's up?  Hey, how are you, guys?  Good morning.  Not you, Danny.  Hi, Danny.  How's everything?  All right?  Yeah, everything's good, man.  Hey, that picture that you guys are talking about with all the guys eating their lunch  up on the top?  Yeah.  That's Radio City.  It is Radio City?  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, it's Radio City.  I actually have the picture. 
[00:09:30]  It says on the bottom, it's small print.  Is it?  I forget the year.  They actually, it says the year on it also.  Yeah, okay.  I believe, but...  That makes more sense, man.  Yeah, it's Radio City.  It's a very famous...  Wait, Radio City...  That's that high?  Wait, Radio...  Hold on a minute.  Now I'm a little confused.  How high is Radio City?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Got me.  Because Radio City Music Hall is...  That's where the trees are.  The Rockefeller Street.  Are you talking Rockefeller Center?  Like...  Well, no, no, no, no, no.  It's actually Radio City Music Hall. 
[00:10:00]  Well, it says Radio City.  Radio City Music Hall doesn't seem that high when I walk past it.  Yeah, now I'm...  Travis is shaking his head.  Why don't we go outside?  It's right next door.  It's right there.  What are we looking for?  It might be the building we're in.  Travis wants to contribute to the show.  Oh, my God.  Travis wants to contribute.  It's the GE building.  Yeah, what does he got?  The GE building.  It's the 69th floor of the GE building.  No way, no how.  No way.  You're right.  No way, no how.  It's the lunchbox hands.  No way, no how.  1932 there, Danny.  32. 
[00:10:30]  1932.  Little rascal.  So wait, so it's the what?  Is that the same lunch with all the guys?  The GE building is at Rockefeller Center.  Rockefeller Center.  Yeah.  So it's what?  So it's not...  It's the 69th floor of the GE building at Rockefeller Center.  Okay, so it's not Radio City Music Hall.  No.  No.  So you're talking about your asshole.  Danny, you're not getting away with this.  What do you mean I'm not getting away with this?  You fucked up.  It's not Radio City.  Hey, just because I fucked up, listen, doesn't mean anything.  Look, we get called out all the time.  I want to call out a listener. 
[00:11:00]  You fucked up and you suck.  Yeah.  I'm going to start a message board how much you suck.  Yes.  That's it.  Blame it on me.  Absolutely.  All right, man.  You do stink.  All right, guys.  Thank you, sir.  GE building.  Take care, guys.  Be well.  There's Danny.  Let's go to Rape Kid in Harlem.  Rape Kid.  What's up, boys?  How's Crawl Space?  Look at me.  I'm whapped there.  Yesterday, you guys, I normally don't do this, but I was listening to the replay because I  couldn't catch live yesterday.  You guys missed out on one of the funniest bits.  When you were doing Andy Rooney and he was talking about, I went around the office to 
[00:11:30]  see how many fruits I can name.  Yeah.  You guys immediately said, oh, we couldn't do that around our office.  And I'm thinking, yeah, sure you could.  Steve C., Travis the Beard, Sam the Twink.  See, we made the gay joke, though, earlier.  Yeah.  See, we made the fruit gay joke earlier, probably using Steve.  I didn't catch it.  Yeah.  See?  So then it would have been silly.  No, we did. 
[00:12:00]  So it would have been silly to do it again.  Oh, damn.  They had B-roll again.  Oh, fat B-roll?  Fat B-roll.  Two days in a row.  Oh, now there's like long-lasting marriage is good for your health B-roll, so they show  couples from the back.  Look, look.  See?  Yes.  Now they're showing couples.  Oh.  That guy could be fat B-roll, though.  Fat B-roll and happily married.  Thank you, Rape Kit.  It was still a good bit.  What do you want from us?  What do you want, a perfect bit every time?  It was a good bit.  You missed it.  Sometimes we got it.  I just wanted to let you know that I was applying for government assistance yesterday, 
[00:12:30]  and Anthony, it'd be great for you to know that I saw nothing but, well, let's just say  I was in Harlem, Harlem and the Bronx, and I saw lots of, mostly women, actually, which  is surprising to me, and they had little, little children that just, you know, reminded  me of your movie theater.  We have to bring them up.  We, if we're doing well, we have to bring them up and help them out, so I'm all for 
[00:13:00]  that.  No, I'm not!  All right, Rape Kit, get out of here.  All right, later, boys.  Thank you, sir.  You've got to annoy me at this hour.  And then Kevin from Connecticut writes again, wait, that's me in the fat B-roll.  Wah, wah, wah.  Could be anybody on the instant feedback.  All right, so we got the two for Tuesday thing.  Yeah.  That's happening.  Two for.  What else were we talking about before the break? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, my God, I know.  We were laughing pretty hard.  Sam was trying to get us all to watch wrestling last night.  That's not happening.  Sam is an ass.  Well, yeah.  He just is an ass.  Well, yeah.  He comes in all excited that something happened on wrestling.  Like, I appreciate the whole WWE thing and Vince McMahon and everything.  They appreciate the money they spent on our show.  Exactly.  Appreciate that.  I appreciate the fact that they, you know, they'll send people out to some of their big  events and things like that from the show. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  What I don't appreciate is the shameless plugging that is now going on with pseudo celebrities  that come on just to plug their shit.  But it's always under the guise of having a problem with one of the wrestlers.  The guy just can't come on and just be some guy and plug it.  Why would I play this, Sam?  Don't you like that, Sam?  You come in and hand me a disc and he just looks at it and goes, ugh.  Why would I play this?  How does that feel, Sam? 
[00:14:30]  Well, he hasn't heard it yet.  What is it?  By the way.  Is that the big night?  Yeah.  Can we squash the rumors that we're not dating, please?  Thank you.  What?  Well, I posted a video and they heard your voice in the background and it was...  It wasn't my voice.  And they think we're dating, so no, we're not.  Wait a minute.  Well, maybe we are.  Oh, I thought it was a video of your chick.  No.  Well, see, that's why they're confused.  All right.  See, that rumor I can't really squash.  Yeah, that's why I just squash it.  Why not just squash it? 
[00:15:00]  True is true.  It's very hard.  Well, why not just squash it?  No.  No, I can't do that.  I'm sorry, Sam.  I wish you would.  Lucky dog.  So, Shaq was what?  Wrestling?  No, he was the...  I'll be honest with you.  Shaq is really entertaining, no matter what he does.  So, it's hard for me...  Those deodorant commercials?  Which ones...  I don't remember.  See?  Exactly.  You don't remember.  I don't remember the...  He does like...  He did like a deodorant commercial.  I don't remember that. 
[00:15:30]  Okay.  Any commercial he's on?  Well, they're a little rough.  Yeah, that's a tough to lie.  All right.  Maybe he's not that entertaining.  Not entertaining with everything he does, but...  But Shaq was on Raw last night?  He was the guest host.  Now, what is this guest hosting?  Is this something Donald Trump brought to it now that he owns it?  No, ever since Donald...  No, because remember, Donald Trump sold it back.  Oh, right!  Right.  I could care less.  So, ever since Donald Trump sold it back, they've been having guest hosts.  Now, why do they have a guest host?  Because they don't have a general manager of Raw right now, so they have a celebrity come 
[00:16:00]  in and do it.  When they had a general manager, did the general manager come out every time?  Who was it?  Vicky Guerrero came out every week.  Oh, yeah.  And said, here's what's happening this week, and sometimes there was chicanery.  Well, that's stupid.  Why have a host for wrestling?  They have the announcers.  It's a general manager type of role.  You know, making sure this is a person who sets the pace for the evening.  I don't like this at all.  The matchmaker. 
[00:16:30]  Imagine if RGM walked in here every day and set the table for everyone.  Well, picture that happening, and then we get to, like, I don't know, give him an elbow  or something.  Right.  Like, why is there always a problem with the guest host?  Well, the thing is, wrestlers are such a hostile bunch.  Yeah.  That somebody, a celebrity comes in.  Holy shit, is this fucking impressive.  See?  I got to say, man.  All right.  Let me tell you something.  I'll tell you what we're looking at now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've seen the big show in person many times.  Yes.  That fucking guy is the biggest guy on this planet. 
[00:17:00]  He's giant.  He's enormous.  I can't even explain how big this guy is if you ever see him live, right?  Shaq just walked over the top rope to confront the big show, and Shaq is actually taller  than the big show and almost as big.  He's taller than the big show.  But he is taller than the big show.  Oh, my God.  A double choke hold.  That's what I was telling you about before.  No way.  Well, you telling it stunk.  Oh.  Watching it, fantastically stinky.  But who's going to play center for the Cleveland Cavaliers next year?  Yeah, isn't...  Well, I mean, that's next year. 
[00:17:30]  Can he sue?  And who are these midgets that just ran into the ring?  Look at the midgets in the ring.  Those are not midgets.  Now anyone walking in the ring looks silly.  Who were the midgets in?  That's crime time.  They look really small.  Why are they called crime time, Sam?  Well, I noticed something about them.  They wear baggy pants.  Yeah, but that's...  They have cornrows.  They like to steal things.  But that seems a little...  They're from Brooklyn.  Racially motivated.  I don't think race has much to do with it. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, right.  Why is Chris Jericho just yelling at Shaq?  Shouldn't he go in the ring if he's a wrestler and do a little damage to Shaq?  Chris Jericho looks like a midget.  Well, yeah.  In the beginning of the show, Chris Jericho was going head-to-head with Shaq.  No, he wasn't.  He came up right below Shaq's chest.  Can I ask why he's wearing a suit?  That's his new thing.  He's a bad guy.  See, if you wear a suit, you're a bad guy.  Why?  Because he looks down on the audience.  He's better than them.  Is that his gimmick now?  Yeah.  Do you believe any of this? 
[00:18:30]  A good amount.  I mean...  A good amount.  I'm still not watching, Sam.  No.  Look at what's going on.  It's very exciting.  Wow.  Even with Shaq and Chris Jericho dressed as a business guy.  Wow.  Look how tiny he is.  We've had Chris Jericho in the studio a lot of times.  And he's a big dude.  He's pretty big.  He is dwarfed by Shaq.  He looks like Little People Big World.  His chest is like ass height on Shaq.  He could suckle on Shaq's nipples.  Yeah.  Barely. 
[00:19:00]  And he'd have to reach out for his toes.  He would have to reach up for that.  Shaq is giant.  Like I'm saying something people don't know.  He's a monster.  Shaq is tall, Opie.  But he's not just like a tall, skinny guy.  Like, he's as big as the wrestlers are.  So, is he going to be wrestling now or just plugging some fucking thing he's doing?  Well, the host role is generally a one-week type of thing.  Oh, only one week?  Last week, it was ZZ Top.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  ZZ Top.  What year is this?  Did they play the Back to the Future 3 song that they played during the big dance? 
[00:19:30]  Do they still have really long beards?  They do.  Oh, that's crazy.  No, they don't.  Except for the guy named Beard.  Frank Beard doesn't have a beard.  Who doesn't have a beard?  He wasn't hosting.  It was just the other two.  Can we play some cool ZZ?  I want to play a cool ZZ Top song right now.  Travis, I challenge you.  Good luck.  I challenge Travis to pick out a cool ZZ Top song right now.  What would he pick?  What would he pick?  Cheap sunglasses? 
[00:20:00]  Not too.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Cheaper than usual.  All right.  Stop this.  Sam.  Yeah?  Is that it?  We're not spending an hour on wrestling.  We don't have to spend an hour, but we should cover it for the audience.  I know you're secretly trying to turn this show into a wrestling show, but it's not happening.  He goes, we should.  It's sports.  We need sports talk on this show.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So we won't be talking about wrestling.  No.  Actually, Shaq's show sounds pretty cool.  He's taking on what? 
[00:20:30]  Athletes at their own sports.  At their own sports.  He's been Twittering things like challenging Tiger Woods to golf.  Oh, okay.  He'll fucking lose.  Not Shaq.  No, Shaq will lose.  They don't make clubs tall enough for someone like Shaq.  He's going to use Tiger as a club, which would be interesting.  Watching him hit the ball with Tiger's head.  What?  Wait.  So it's professionals.  Does he have people lined up, or is he just blurting this out?  Yeah.  Do we know what some of the shows are going to be?  Yeah.  Give me a little taste.  Because, I mean, him Twittering that he wants to take Tiger on, that's ridiculous. 
[00:21:00]  That would be fun for two seconds.  Yeah.  He's got to be getting into some real stuff that might be good TV.  I don't know any of the people he's actually taking on, but the TV show is happening.  It's a big show.  I know he's training to fight in the MMA.  He's crazy.  Is that true or not?  No way.  Well, he's not professional.  He might be training.  The big Korean dude, right?  That big, giant Korean MMA fighter?  I think he's Korean.  Is Shaq still playing basketball?  Yeah.  He's going to be playing with LeBron James.  Is he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got a chance to win it all up there in Cleveland. 
[00:21:30]  And I say we because I'm a fan of LeBron.  Because Shaq is going to hurt himself.  As my Knicks continue to get to a place where I can start watching them again, finally.  Jesus Christ.  How many years now?  Wow.  Sorry.  No, you're right.  Because I remember you hemming and hawing about the Knicks during the N.E.W. days.  Oh, yeah.  And then there's just been nothingness.  No, nothing.  They had a good run back then.  That's how fucking long we've been back in New York.  Damn.  Anyway.  Isn't he going to hurt himself, though? 
[00:22:00]  No, he's the man.  And not be able to play basketball?  Shaq is the man of steel.  He considers himself a Superman.  Really?  Yes.  He's got a big Superman tattoo on his head.  He can't be hurt?  No.  All righty.  So there you go.  Can't wait to see him get injured.  Let's hear Shaq on the mic at Raw last night.  You need mic skills.  He's got him.  Does he got him?  All right.  You trying to intimidate me, blow me kisses, look, you'd have a better chance of making  two free throws in a row. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, no.  He did.  Oh, is that the big show?  That is the big show.  Goofing on his lack of free throw skills.  Even Anthony knows that.  Even I know Shaq stinks at throwing free throws.  Although I think he's gotten better.  Am I right?  Slightly.  All righty.  Over the years.  Perhaps I'm wrong.  The best ever, the best ever, I think it was when he was playing for the Lakers, I think.  They actually hired, the Lakers hired.  No.  Listen to this. 
[00:23:00]  Who wouldn't want this gig?  A free throw coach.  For real.  They hired a special guy.  To say, stand here and put it in that basket.  To coach Shaq on how to freaking shoot free throws.  How amazing of a job would that be?  Why was it ever determined why he's so bad?  If you're that tall and you play basketball, how easy?  Shouldn't it be easy to stand there at a line at a set distance every time and throw it in? 
[00:23:30]  He can't.  He basically can't shoot the basketball.  At all?  He's got to dunk?  10 feet from the basket, he's useless.  Really?  More or less.  Wow.  More or less.  Yeah.  He's got to do all his damage down low, close to the basket.  Yeah.  He can't just shoot jumpers.  No, huh?  No.  Like Kobe Bryant?  Hell fucking no.  Because he's just...  The ball feels probably like a golf ball in his hands. 
[00:24:00]  To begin with.  You know.  All right.  Back to Shaq on the mic.  Shaq.  Now I'm hearing the response.  You've been intimidating me.  So why don't you do the smart thing, Slim, and get out of my ring?  Let me tell you something, fat boy.  Oh, no.  I'm working on a show right now.  It's called Shaq versus.  I'm going for some of the greatest athletes. 
[00:24:30]  Not that I consider you a great athlete, but I'll tell you what I'm going to do right now  in Washington, D.C.  I'm going to challenge you to a match right now, right here.  Right here, right now.  That could be the worst.  It just came up in conversation.  What a shoehorned in plug that was.  He just...  Because the big show really nailed him.  Yeah.  And he comes back and goes, well, let me tell you something.  I got a show.  He did call him fat boy.  Yeah, well, fat boy.  Wow. 
[00:25:00]  And then he has to get his show out there.  Yeah.  What the...  Give up on this wrestling thing.  Sam, enough.  Enough.  Just because three weeks ago when Seth Green hosted, it happened to be the only Raw ever  where Robot Chicken has come up in conversation.  Robot Chicken just comes up.  And why would he be in the ring at all?  What did he do?  He was a guest host.  And he ended up in a tag team with John Cena and Triple H.  Okay.  Oh, God.  What did he do?  Kick someone in the balls?  Punch them in the balls?  Yeah.  What was his move? 
[00:25:30]  After the guy was safely held back?  He dropped an elbow.  Once he was on the mat.  That's embarrassing.  Stop it.  I'm embarrassed.  We've had Seth Green on the show a few times, and he is tiny.  Yes.  Yeah.  Tiny.  Shaq kissed Chris Jericho on the forehead last night while Chris Jericho was trying to  be intimidating.  That's cute.  Next week...  Would you have sex with Shaq?  If he made me, I guess.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Look.  He looks ridiculous. 
[00:26:00]  Seth Green.  Seth Green.  Where's Seth Green?  In the red t-shirt.  He's in the red t-shirt.  Get the hell out of here.  The little kid.  The little kid.  He looks ridiculous.  It's like, take your kid to work day.  All right.  This is what I do, son, for a living.  I wrestle.  Now, he decided...  I do homoerotic activity with other men.  That's not homoerotic.  He decided I'm going to be in a tag team match?  He put himself in the match.  He's standing there looking like someone's child.  Oh, yeah.  Now he's going to tag?  No.  Triple H said, just kidding. 
[00:26:30]  I'm not going to throw you in this one.  Triple H just tagged John Cena.  What is it?  Three against one?  No.  It's three on three.  Oh, three on three.  I don't see the other tag guys.  It's the legacy versus John Cena, Triple H, and Seth Green.  Seth looks retarded also.  Why would Seth Green agree to this?  Why do this?  He looks embarrassing.  This isn't good.  Look, there he is.  He's in the ring now.  He's got his fist taped.  Oh, they hold him back.  Uh-oh.  Oh, he couldn't even sell it.  He punched like a girl. 
[00:27:00]  That's Cody Rhodes he knocked down there.  Yeah.  Did he?  Oh, now he's got all confidence.  Uh-oh.  And now he's, oh, wow, he ran out of the ring.  Where's he going?  Where's the little kid going?  Lame.  This is so stupid.  Lame.  Lame.  And you tape this shit every week.  Every week.  Good for you.  Yep.  You waste.  And he got the pin.  Yeah, he almost got the pin.  All right, look.  We're going to have to watch the wrestling Seth Green three-on-three match.  Hey, I got a question for you, though.  For real.  One of our pals, I didn't even know this, this is how out of wrestling I am, Taz is not 
[00:27:30]  in the WWE anymore?  No.  And he just made his debut with TNA?  He's in TNA with Mick Foley.  Oh.  Kurt Angle.  When did the WWE get rid of Taz?  He left.  He got tired.  He was doing play-by-play for years.  No, I know.  And he was very good at it.  He was really good, but he got tired of it, I guess.  I mean, that's what Mick Foley did, too.  He got tired of doing, people get tired of doing play-by-play because apparently Vince McMahon  yells.  That's what Mick Foley told us.  Right, right.  He yells in the headphones.  Right.  Imagine that in your head as you're trying to do a show. 
[00:28:00]  So Taz wants to wrestle again?  What do you mean, Opie?  Taz wants to wrestle?  Go ahead, keep talking now.  Don't just lie to the microphone.  You were talking to that guy.  Now keep talking to Sam.  Sam.  Yeah.  So Taz is going to be now wrestling.  You said that already.  For the love of God.  Keep going in here.  Will you give me an update on Taz, please?  All right, good one.  Okay, that's good.  He's going to be a manager now.  A manager?  Yeah.  Why did you repeat what Sam just said?  He said a manager. 
[00:28:30]  You said a manager.  Take your lesson.  Listen over your phone.  As a manager, will he be wrestling in TNA?  Good question.  All right, thank you.  I mean, I'm not supposed to be wrestling.  Don't answer me.  I'm in your head, folks.  I'm sorry.  I'm not.  Don't answer me.  I'm in your head, folks.  Taz will be a manager.  I don't think he's going to wrestle.  He said a lot of times that he does not want to wrestle anymore, and he's not in the  shape to wrestle.  McFoley said he didn't want to wrestle, and then he was wrestling for the title.  McFoley also said after his retirement match that this is not going to be one of those  retirements where he comes back the next week, and then he wrestled a match a month 
[00:29:00]  later.  So he's never been a man of his word as far as retirement goes.  I feel sorry for McFoley.  Don't feel sorry for anybody that left the WWE.  Don't even talk about why you're having this conversation.  Stop talking about people in WWE.  Or you're a fool.  Wow, you're a hurt.  McFoley lost the belt, though, so maybe he'll stop wrestling.  He's got to stop wrestling because he's going to get hurt.  I consider him a friend.  Yeah.  Not even a friend of the show.  A friend. 
[00:29:30]  We've shared some time on the Long Island Railroad.  Maybe he wanted to be alone for the ride into New York, but I was lonely, and I sat next  to him.  We talked.  Taz scared the shit out of me one day.  I was getting into my truck out in front of the old studio, and I started it up, and  I'm adjusting the air conditioning and everything else, and my window was open, and Taz walked  right up to my window and just went, hey, and I turned around and was like, ah!  It's just a big animal at my window.  He is an animal.  He frightened me.  I was ready to get out and give him my car keys. 
[00:30:00]  He's like, here, I'm being carjacked, and then I realized it was Taz.  I like Taz, and he knows how to do radio, too.  Yeah.  He is good.  He really knows how, but there's no spot for him right now.  Yeah.  Wasn't he at K-Rock for a while?  They were trying him out, right?  Yeah, he was doing the trial shows at night.  He was doing pretty good.  Yep.  All right.  Goddamn with his missing teeth.  Mick Foley.  Holy shit.  Stop wrestling, Mick Foley.  Please.  I know.  Please stop.  Please.  He's still got a couple in him. 
[00:30:30]  Does he?  Yeah.  Does he look good when he's wrestling?  He's on Triple H.  Holy shit.  He looks...  Oh, God.  I mean, he's a showman.  He just looks great in the ring because he knows how to work the crowd, and he's great  on the mic and all that.  He's certainly past his peak.  He looks better than his first match back when he really wasn't working out and still  wrestling in sweatpants and stuff.  I liked, um, what's, uh, what is Dude Love doing these days?  Dude Love has retired, I think, from wrestling.  Oh, is Dude Love retired?  It's, uh, Mick Foley as Cactus Jack. 
[00:31:00]  No, that wasn't Mick Foley, was it?  No, no, I'm saying Mick Foley is wrestling, looking like Cactus Jack in TNA.  Why?  Because Vince owns Mick Foley.  Exactly.  He's not called Cactus Jack.  He's called Mick Foley.  Oh, no.  He just dresses like Cactus Jack.  So he's not allowed to look like the old Mick Foley of mankind.  Desert Plant John, they call him.  So he's...  Ooh, P-U.  Oh.  He can't call himself Cactus Jack, though.  Hmm.  Because...  That's mine.  I own you. 
[00:31:30]  I think that's where Dude Love is, too.  Where's Dude Love?  I'm surprised Vince didn't say you can keep Dude Love.  It's stunk.  The character that Mick Foley invented in his backyard when he was 17.  He doesn't own it anymore.  He can't have it.  What a prick, Vince is.  He's a fuck.  What a prick.  The guy's a billionaire.  Let the guy have...  I'm keeping Dude Love.  Never know when I might bring Dude Love back.  What's he gonna do with Dude Love?  You don't give it to Mick.  There's no way Dude Love is doing anything. 
[00:32:00]  What if there's a resurgence in Dude Love retro t-shirts?  By the way...  I don't think there will be.  By the way, one of the worst entrance videos I've ever seen with Dude Love.  He's in his tie-dye shirt.  Oh, it's so good.  And there's a bad, like, green-screened background of, like, groovy stuff.  It's so bad.  Dude Love.  Yeah, it is Dude Love.  Look how bad it is.  But... 
[00:32:30]  Oh, is he stupid?  No, but I think Mick Foley knows it's bad.  I hope he does.  He's running.  He's running.  Oh, he knows this is bad.  How did I remember this?  Oh, oh.  Look, he's...  What is he doing?  This is not music.  I love the part where he's flying.  Oh, no.  They don't have him flying.  Dude Love music.  Oh, Paul Anka in the background.  Does that stupid...  What do you call that thing with the knees and the Charleston? 
[00:33:00]  Right.  And he's just dancing in this bad tie-dyed shirt that says Dude Love on it.  And then he's flying through the cosmos.  He said in his book that he would talk to Vince McMahon when they were first doing this.  He said he didn't understand how they could dress Dude Love up as a tie-dye hippie  and have him come out to Bee Gees music.  Yeah, why would he do that?  It doesn't make sense.  This is audible.  This doesn't match the look.  No, it's awful. 
[00:33:30]  There he is.  You're running.  All right, enough about the wrestling.  Never.  We can only do like 15 minutes of wrestling.  Because I'm an ass man.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  He goes out.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm an ass man.  Yeah.  Don't die.  All right, enough ass man.  We don't have to hear what he does with an ass.  He likes to stick them.  I know, and kiss them and kick them and whatever.  Side piece is an ass man.  What?  Oh, man.  Ass woman.  Huh?  Nice. 
[00:34:00]  I don't even know what that means.  She doesn't have a nice...  Well, let's just say.  She's well built.  She's a very attractive girl.  Yeah, she is.  Why did Dr. Steve say,  he sent me a text yesterday saying...  We all got that.  ...that he would send me pictures...  ...of side piece.  ...of side piece.  Oh, boy.  Good pictures.  Like, did he ever go and...  Did he ever examine her for anything?  Certainly not.  And I bet Dr. Steve did not want that information getting out there because...  Let me tell you something, Dr. Steve!  That's right.  I'm not going to listen to you!  All right. 
[00:34:30]  It's always an angle.  Uh-oh.  Deadly home invasion.  Wakefield.  The Bronx.  The Bronx.  That's not a home invasion.  That's just life in the Bronx.  Somebody came home.  Yes.  It's just an invasion.  All right.  Very good, Danny.  Someone came home.  Are we done with wrestling?  Until I see Dr. Steve.  All right.  Oh!  While I have you here.  His face!  While I have you here because...  By the way, email those pictures, Dr. Steve.  We were...  Email them.  I guess we're in the middle of our sports break.  We got to put...  Sports break.  We got to put some time aside for this Michael Vick thing because there's some people angry 
[00:35:00]  that he's being reinstated in the NFL.  Which is silly.  You know, I'm no big fan of dog fighting myself.  But the guy did the crime.  He did the time.  Now, let him work.  Again.  Somebody was explaining on Twitter to me yesterday all the horrific things he was doing with  his dog fighting.  Whatever.  It came out in court and he did his time.  Yes.  If he does it again, then, you know, throw him out for good or whatever.  But...  And people care more about their dogs than human beings. 
[00:35:30]  Than people.  So that's why this might be a major problem for Michael Vick.  Because even though he's reinstated, it doesn't mean that he's going to be playing football  anytime soon.  You can actually kill somebody and do your time for, like, manslaughter.  Get out and be reinstated and play.  And no one will have a problem with it.  They won't go, hey, murderer's playing murderer.  But doggies?  I completely agree.  People get freaked out about little doggies.  I think generally, I think human beings care about dogs more than human beings.  Yeah.  Yes.  Except for maybe the human beings really close to you. 
[00:36:00]  But as soon as you get past that tiny little inner circle...  Past your nuclear family.  Oh, yeah.  Then it's all about puppies and dogs.  Then you care about dogs more than any other human beings out there.  Although, I've got to give him one thing.  I've never had an uncle that licked peanut butter off my balls.  Oh, boy.  But a dog?  Man's best friend.  I've got to tell you.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  He's not here.  And look, I have his mic on.  I know.  His mic is up for no reason.  I've got Jimmy's mic on.  Jimmy's filming a movie until Friday. 
[00:36:30]  He'll be back Friday, though.  Oh, so yeah.  Yeah, Michael Vick.  A team still has to pick him up?  Yeah.  It's just that NFL said that, yes, he can play.  What team out there?  Or is it tentative or something?  You know there's a few owners just going, oh.  They're looking at their phone like, oh, he could really help our team, boss.  No, there's no one in the friggin' stands.  It's just really.  Our team stinks.  They're getting itchy.  We just need asses in the seats.  They're getting itchy.  This will get us press.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  You know the publicity of him in our uniform?  What teams?  What teams are awful that would even consider?  I think it has to be an awful team.  Awful NFL team.  Let's talk about your awful NFL teams.  And I mean awful as just awful human beings, awful fans.  All right.  The Raiders.  Yes!  The Raiders are just hardcore.  Number one awful team in the NFL.  It's like a gang went into the NFL.  Yes.  That's what it's like.  So don't be surprised if the Raiders say, hey, Michael Vick, you can play with us. 
[00:37:30]  I think, give me another awful NFL team.  Awful team.  I mean, after the Raiders, there's a big drop-off.  Yeah.  Like, name a team they, like, like, like.  Detroit went zero and 16.  Detroit.  Awful NFL team, probably.  Awful team.  Like, just bad dudes.  So.  Bad fans.  Bad meaning good, by the way.  Just nasty.  The Jets.  Well, I was thinking a New York team wouldn't be bad.  Yeah?  Yeah, because New Yorkers are just assholes in general. 
[00:38:00]  And they don't really care?  They're just assholes.  As much as I try to be, you know, a New Yorker, I hate that I'm around a bunch of assholes  every day.  New Yorkers.  Give me another team.  Someone else said Detroit.  Yes.  Cleveland Browns.  Apparently Detroit got a good quarterback in the draft, is what I'm reading here.  Yeah, but a lot of people are saying that he's not going to be playing quarterback.  Oh, right, right.  They're going to move him to another position.  Yeah.  Patriots, Dolphins, awful NFL teams. 
[00:38:30]  I'm talking awful, like nasty.  Like not bad players, but like just bad people, then Cowboys.  Cowboys.  Cowboys have always had a reputation of being a criminal team.  They're a team of criminals.  You know what Dallas loves as this person.  See, if you instant feedback from a cell phone, you know, pop your name in if you want a little  credit.  This guy writes, Dallas loves felons.  Yeah.  Dallas, an awful NFL team that would be a nice place for Michael Vick.  Horrible people.  Name an NFL team too nice, too, too, too. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, wow.  San Francisco 49ers.  49ers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I was thinking more like you got to go Midwest.  Like just that nice part of the country.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Okay.  Give me a nice NFL team.  Nice.  Someone.  Where they all look neat in their uniforms.  Kansas City Chiefs.  Kansas City Chiefs.  The Chiefs.  Hard-nosed football, those boys.  Yeah.  That might be a rough one. 
[00:39:30]  How about the Browns?  An awful team?  Oh, this guy's wearing an I Love Jill shirt.  Well.  And he just got doused with water.  Well.  She doesn't go out with you anymore.  She's not looking that bad these days.  I'm really kind of looking at her going, she's not looking that bad.  You notice I peek over there every so often going like.  That means you're lonely.  I give up.  You're lonely.  Just hang in there.  Should I grab that?  Hang in there.  You'll be all right.  Should I hit that?  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  You're lonely.  When you start looking that way again, that means you're just lonely. 
[00:40:00]  You're right.  Thanks.  I needed that.  The next one's right around the corner.  That was a thanks.  I needed that smack in the face you just gave me.  Thanks.  I've heard.  You know.  I got the inside with you.  It just means you're lonely.  You'll be all right.  It's the dark hair, though.  It's kind of.  I like that a lot better than the blonde hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Green Bay.  Green Bay.  Green Bay.  Awful team.  And when I mean awful, you don't understand, right?  The criteria.  You just mean bad humans.  Just nasty.  Like the Raiders you nailed it are just awful.  Raiders are horrible. 
[00:40:30]  They're horrific human beings in general.  Their fans are all gang members.  Oh, yeah.  That just want to kill people.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  They take a break from their drive-bys to watch a game.  Yeah.  It's Packers, man.  Danny just fucked it up.  He's got a giant fake, like, it looks like it's made out of cheese, the helmet, and then  he's wearing big pasties over his nipples.  He's a fat guy.  Does our Green Bay Packer prank call still hold up?  I don't know.  I haven't heard that in forever.  Travis, can you find that? 
[00:41:00]  Maybe we'll play it at a break.  If it holds up great, if not, what do you want?  Then we'll just be embarrassed.  Yeah, we gave it a try.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Here you go.  The Colts.  Ah, that's good.  There's a nice team that Michael Vick would never play for.  The Colts.  The Colts would never call Michael Vick.  They're like, hell fucking no.  Although, they do have a scumbag reputation for just, like, pulling out of town.  True.  So, that was years ago, but still.  The Colts are nice.  The Broncos.  There you go.  Here we go.  Oh, the Broncos.  Here we go.  Now, people are getting involved with the bit. 
[00:41:30]  The Broncos are a nice team.  Yeah.  The Colts are a nice team.  The Raiders are a nasty team.  The Cowboys are a nasty team.  The Browns could go either way.  Yeah.  What do you think with the Browns?  Yeah.  They got the dog pound.  Dog pound.  Just because they have the dog, they can never call Michael Vick.  You can't even place a phone call.  Their mascot is a dog.  The mascot's a dog.  So, they are completely out.  They could want him so bad. 
[00:42:00]  It's over.  Never, ever happening.  That's not happening.  No.  How awkward would that be?  Opening day.  Awkward.  The mascot walks over to him, does that mascot, one hand on hip, the other hand waving a finger in his face.  Hey, hey, don't make me fight.  Ravens.  People are screaming the Ravens.  Yeah.  Ravens, come on.  Big time, Crimms.  This guy writes.  Yeah.  Nice team, the Vikings. 
[00:42:30]  Yes, the Vikings are a nice team.  A nice team.  The great state of Minnesota.  The Titans need a new quarterback, but they're kind of a nice team.  Yeah, yeah.  Right?  You know who's a nice team?  Huh?  The Carolina Panthers.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  What a nice, pleasant team.  There you go.  You can't bring Michael Vick into a nice NFL city.  You got it.  You know what?  I can't think of more awful teams, though.  How about Pittsburgh?  Pittsburgh.  Steelers.  I think Steelers more had a reputation than has now, but they did have a pretty good reputation of being a badass. 
[00:43:00]  Steelers is very good, Ant.  I think Michael Vick can play for the Steelers.  Yeah.  You know, hands down, the Eagles would welcome Michael Vick with open arms.  Open claws, those bastards.  If you throw shit at Santa Claus, you don't mind a Michael Vick on your team.  They would do something like maybe dog collars.  They'd throw dog collars at him.  The field would be covered with spiky dog collars. 
[00:43:30]  But they would do that just to show love.  Yeah, yeah.  That they love him.  The Bengals have all criminals on the team.  Joe in Ohio says.  Let's go to Joe.  All criminals.  Hey, gentlemen.  Hey.  Not only is Cincinnati a nasty city, but half the team is criminal ridden, and most of them are repeat offenders.  I mean, just look at Chris Henry.  There you go.  Okay.  He fits in there.  So there's a team that Michael Vick could go to.  I like it.  How about Nico in D.C.?  Nico.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[00:44:00]  Hey.  I think you're missing the big fucking obvious here.  Mean machine?  Against the guards?  It has to be the Redskins.  Ah.  Come on.  D.C. voted in that cheap bastard, Marion Barry.  That's true.  After he, like, did the whole prostitution and drug shit.  We don't get rid of anybody.  We don't give a fuck.  It's gotta be D.C.  I like your thinking, but it'll never happen because it's too close to Obama.  Yeah, that's true.  And Obama's trying to clean up the world, my friends.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he's trying to clean up the world. 
[00:44:30]  He doesn't want to be.  Already a horrible team.  Obama makes one call and says, no fucking way.  Not in my backyard.  Yep.  My daughters love dogs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We have a dog, and we love our dogs.  Shut up.  So D.C. has a problem.  Although he would be a good fit, it ain't happening.  Yeah.  It ain't happening.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, the Vikings, I said, was kind of a nice team.  This guy writes, this guy, green guy from Buffalo.  Vikings are nice.  Let's not forget the hooker boat party from two years ago. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, man, right.  They rock.  But that's nice.  That does rock.  All right.  So maybe the Vikings get Michael Vick.  Let's see if we have a few more here.  Let's go to Craig in Clifton.  Craig.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Hey, I'm a San Francisco 49ers fan, and actually the Niners declined Michael Vick.  Yeah.  Well, that's what Ann said.  That's a nice team.  Yeah, that's a nice team.  Too nice.  I'm telling you, this is what it's going to come down to in the end.  You don't need sports radio and ESPN and all that bullshit. 
[00:45:30]  Michael Vick will be playing in the NFL.  He's too talented.  He did his time, like Anthony said, like it or not, and he will go to a team that is  considered an awful team, a team with a bad-ass reputation.  Bad rep.  Look, the two teams that are actually in the running right now are the Vikings and the  Raiders.  Yeah, the Raiders.  Told you, Raiders.  You know what?  I bet you he goes to the Raiders.  I bet it's the Raiders.  It all depends on Brett Favre and if he comes back or not.  Because those fans just will not give a shit.  Not at all.  They're all felons. 
[00:46:00]  Every Raiders fan is a felon.  They have to be.  It's a blanket statement.  Yeah.  What about the Texans?  You're saying, Craig, they're looking at them?  The Texans are looking at them just because they have the quarterback controversy since  David Carr, since they got into the league.  Is Houston considered kind of a bad-ass reputation?  I don't know.  The Texans?  I don't know about a bad reputation.  I like the Oilers.  I like the Oilers.  Yeah, I like the name of the Oilers.  What happened to the Oilers?  Yeah.  Come on, Texans. 
[00:46:30]  Texans.  That's just a dumb name.  Yeah.  I respect that you like your home state.  The Oilers.  The Oilers just sounded cooler.  Yeah.  Wasn't their helmet logo an oil rig?  Yeah.  They just had an oil rig on their helmet.  That is stupid.  Now that you think about it.  Look how horrible they look, too.  We're the Wisconsin textile machine guys. 
[00:47:00]  We're going to have a textile machine.  Let's get a sixth grader to draw our logo.  It's a fucking oil rig.  Let's go to Woody in Philly.  Woody.  Yeah.  Hey.  The Boise vacuum press.  Hold on, hold on.  What?  The Boise vacuum pressers, where they press your clothing.  They're from Boise, and the side of their helmet has one of those steam presses.  Is this real?  No, of course not.  Who knows, though?  I don't know if it's some minor league team somewhere. 
[00:47:30]  I just think it's silly to have a vacuum presser.  You think the pros have awful team names.  You do the minor league thing?  Oh, we did that bit, though, right?  Yeah.  There's some horrendous names.  Let's go to Woody in Philly.  Woody.  Yeah, you're missing the obvious for Vic.  A lot of the Tampa Bay Bucs were busted for beating their bitches.  Oh, there you go.  Tampa Bay has got to be on the list.  You can beat your bitches, but don't hurt the puppies.  No.  I bet you if you did a survey.  Oh, yeah.  Beating dogs worse than beating your bitches.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Sorry, but I'm talking generally speaking, that's what people would say.  If you were a guy on charges of domestic violence, you'd still get a gig.  Yeah.  They'd still hire you.  You'd be like, yeah, what happened?  Bitch asked for it.  Chester took the easy way out.  I would have fucking sold him to Michael Vick.  Motherfucking Chester.  We'll meet again, motherfucker.  Are you finally fessing up to killing Chester?  I'm just still mad.  Oh, okay.  All these years. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, see, now we go back to Jimmy in Jersey.  Jimmy?  Oh, Jimmy.  Yo, what's up?  Arizona Cardinals are the weakest team in the NFL.  There's no way Vick would go there.  Their fans are too nice.  Their organization's too nice.  Look at Kurt Warner's smile.  That says it all about the franchise.  And you know what?  This is probably where, and I don't agree, but you need some color in the stands.  Yeah.  I get creeped out when I see the Mets play the Cardinals or whatever, and you look in the 
[00:49:00]  stands and it's like, there's not one black person in St. Louis.  I mean, there's badass areas in St. Louis, but they don't go to the games.  No.  No.  All the retirees.  If you didn't know any better, if you just tuned in like a Cardinals-Mets game, and the  Mets are playing away, obviously, you would think that St. Louis is nothing but white  people.  Yeah.  Yep.  And they all wrestle-like to be one.  They all have the red and white on.  The red and white.  I know. 
[00:49:30]  The stand's full of them.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm pulling on Lakers Naval Station.  I got to roll.  All right.  Right on, brother.  What do you have to tell us now?  The Cardinals are too nice.  Well, I have another nice team.  Yes.  The Seattle Seahawks.  Ah.  Yeah.  What about the Seahawks?  They're just depressed all the time.  They're nice.  They're just sad.  They're nice.  It rains a lot.  We're sad.  The MIT engineers?  Is that really?  And why is it a beaver?  Is that an angry beaver, is their logo? 
[00:50:00]  I think so.  Because it builds things?  It looks like an angry pussy.  It's important.  It builds things.  That looks like an angry-  Go back there.  I love that.  Look closely.  That is a pussy with some nice lips, and then they got the little tuft of hair above.  Yeah, let me squint.  Which would be the nose.  Yeah, it's a big-  The mouth is a pussy with the little-  Shaved hair.  Uh-huh.  That's a beaver.  That's a beaver.  All right.  The MIT engineers.  Oh, 10 worst team names.  Danny found it. 
[00:50:30]  Dan, you want to run down the list?  Yeah, Travis, help me out with this.  You got the Santa Cruz banana slugs.  No, no, they're not called that.  They're not called that.  Yes, they are.  Why?  What is a banana slug?  I'll have to go back to the first page and look at it.  Hang on.  Oh, it's a picture of E-Rock on the helmet.  Oh, here's the banana slugs.  Ah, look at-  Why did they make a banana slug look cute?  Look, it's got little glasses on.  It says a banana slug is a slimy yellow mollusk that slides across the ground, leaving an  oily residue wherever it goes.  Jesus.  Why would you name your team that? 
[00:51:00]  Stop it.  That's disgusting.  Hold on.  You know what?  This has to be brought into the Michael Vick discussion.  Yeah, listen to this one, Ant.  Randy in Ohio.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  Randy.  Yeah, Dante Stallworth at Cleveland Browns just killed two people in Miami drunk driving,  and he only got 30 days.  Michael Vick gets 18 months for torturing a dog.  And Dante Stallworth will be playing opening day.  I believe he will be.  Yes, he will be.  No protests, no angry people. 
[00:51:30]  This will prove the point we're making this morning, that it's way worse to abuse dogs  than kill innocent human beings.  Now, obviously, Dante Stallworth didn't mean to kill those people, but he did kill two  humans, and he will be playing opening day.  What do you got?  Is that really the team name?  The Long Beach State Dirtbags?  That would be a great name for a team.  That's not bad.  It's a good hat.  It says their proper name is the 49ers, but they've gone by the Dirtbags since the late 
[00:52:00]  80s.  The Dirtbags.  49ers is kind of taken.  What was that other one that was a real long name that I saw previously on that page?  Previously on that page.  Yeah.  The St. Louis College of Pharmacy.  The St. Louis College of Pharmacy Eutectics.  What the hell does that mean? 
[00:52:30]  What's a eutectic?  It says here, imagine you're a pharmaceutical college and you needed to come up with a name  for your sports team.  The obvious choice, of course, is the term for the process of combining two solids to  form a liquid.  So I guess that's what eutectics are.  Oh, wonderful.  I bet they just get their ass handed to them every time, every sport.  Some people are saying Dante Stallworth will not be playing opening day.  Travis, you know anything on that?  No, I don't.  I think he...  I don't know. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, thank you.  Nice contribution.  That was like Mars.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  That was horrid.  Silent partner.  Yes.  See, stupid me, I think Travis might know a little something about sports.  I know a lot about sports.  Do you?  Not quite enough, though.  I just don't know much about the Dante Stallworth situation.  Yeah.  Apparently not.  Brooke Hogan's coming back tomorrow?  I just found out.  Oh, yeah?  Kelly, Brooke Hogan, and Michael Emerson in studio tomorrow.  Nice.  Michael Emerson.  Yes.  All right.  A lot of speculation about Lost based on some of the little trailers that were played during 
[00:53:30]  the Geek Convention.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And I'd be very excited to ask Ben about that.  What are the speculations?  What do they do?  Well, apparently, during the Geek Convention, as I was informed by Travis.  It's not really, you know what?  Yeah.  It's not really a geek convention anymore.  I know.  It's gone mainstream.  I think this is the year it sort of went mainstream, right?  Yeah.  Before this year, it was absolutely a geek thing. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Well, people, you know, actual stars showed up, not just has-beens.  Right.  And wannabes.  Right.  So, yeah, it kind of did go a little more mainstream.  But apparently, Lost, as per Dummy, inside there that knows nothing about sports.  I wouldn't say that.  Well, I would.  They're making it look like they are going to just reset and go back to the plane actually 
[00:54:30]  lands in Los Angeles, and everyone gets off and starts going about their lives.  What?  Well, they showed, what, Hurley at the chicken stand?  Yeah, there was three commercials.  They showed one that Hurley owned a chicken restaurant.  A chicken restaurant, which I guess he got with his, what, lottery money or something.  And then the other one was-  Kate on America's Most Wanted.  Kate on America's Most Wanted, which means she must have escaped from the person that  was escorting her on the plane. 
[00:55:00]  And then what was the third one?  The Oceanic commercial bragging about their 30 years without a crash.  Without a crash.  Which kind of gives it away.  It kind of, it was very subtle.  They give away the fact that perhaps that reset, that setting off the bomb on the island in  the last episode of last season, kind of did the trick.  But I believe-  I think it'll be a little more complicated than that.  That's just it.  It's a little too easy.  I think that's going to happen. 
[00:55:30]  But if that happens, then the island still has Ben on it.  They're still in, he's still in charge.  They're still there.  But I think the people that get off in LA are going to have like that kind of quirky little  like a second memory thing where they kind of still know that they're joined together  by something.  And the people on the island are also going to have a kind of twitchy second memory. 
[00:56:00]  And it's going to all bring them kind of back together again in some way, shape, or form.  Travis, comment?  Yeah, I read-  You don't know anything about it?  I read an interview with Matthew Fox.  No.  Dr. Jack Shepard.  Of course, Jack Shepard.  He said the first couple episodes are going to be really confusing.  It's really good with the call screener in the background.  Hello?  Hope you're not at the show.  They should know to be quiet.  I know, they probably should.  Going to be very confusing?  Yeah.  Like the whole series hasn't been.  Yeah, like this has all been a piece of cake.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm looking forward to it. 
[00:56:30]  And this is the last season?  Yeah.  And talking with Ben will just be amazing.  You think-  I just call him Ben.  You think they'll do the Sopranos ending?  That seems to be popular.  Where they're all in a diner, and a Journey song plays, and it ends.  But that type of ending where you're like, what?  Come on, you motherfuckers.  Wrap this up for me.  I need to go on to another show.  It would be good if it did wrap up.  They've said that it will absolutely not be like the Sopranos.  All right, good.  Whatever you wanted to know will be answered.  The main questions will be answered. 
[00:57:00]  Who dropped the food in season two?  Yep, they're going to talk about who dropped the food.  Who dropped the food?  I want to know.  Wow.  Jack was there?  He was on the panel?  Yeah.  Not this year, but maybe last year.  Oh, last year?  Hey, Travis, a lot of people saying Dante Stallworth is out for the whole season.  Yeah, he's suspended indefinitely.  Oh.  Some people say it's only.  You can't kill somebody then, apparently.  He's only suspended for four games.  And I guess he killed one guy in a drunk driving accident and cost a very expensive plea for manslaughter. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, he's out already.  Thank you, Kevin B.  He's not in jail anymore.  Oh.  Right, so.  All right, so you can't really just kill people and then play football.  Someone wrote, what about the Buffalo Bills?  They got T.O.  Wow, yeah.  Who's a lunatic and doesn't like his name mispronounced.  Tyrell?  Even though everyone says.  Tyrell?  Yeah, now I'm confused.  What is it, Terrell?  He says, yeah, Terrell?  Tyrell.  I don't know.  And they got O.J.'s name still on the wall up there.  Oh, come on.  So that's a good place. 
[00:58:00]  They have O.J.'s name on the wall?  Still, yeah.  Still?  They got like kind of a Hall of Fame wall up there or something like that.  And O.J.'s still on the wall.  They never took his name off the wall, so.  They actually have a segment where they look in the reflection in people's eyeballs to see what's in their eye on Lost.  Is that what they're doing?  Well, it looks like there was a season six teaser.  Yeah.  And all you see is somebody's eye.  So I guess this person, whoever runs his website, decided to go and screen cap everybody's eye so that you could compare and contrast to see whose eye it is. 
[00:58:30]  I know that's John Locke.  The internet loves Lost.  No kidding.  They really do.  It's perfect for the internet.  God bless them.  Let's say hi to Eddie in Florida.  Eddie.  Yeah.  Hey.  Probably the best place would be the New Orleans Saints because about half of that crowd has already been to a dog fight.  So they know about that.  Punch it out.  Wait, half the crowd's been to a dog fight, though.  I'm trying to figure out where he was going with that. 
[00:59:00]  I was, too.  All right.  Let's go to Steve in Florida.  Can't punch out when you're in a crater.  Steve.  Yeah.  I remember during Michael Vick's charges when he was in court one day, the Ira Van Gretten show, who I know, you guys are a big fan of her.  Yeah.  She was talking to a news reporter there, and he said that there were more people there upset and holding up signs against Michael Vick than there were against somebody else who had just been convicted of a rape charge.  The Ira Van Gretten goes, are you telling me, and he's a host of another show on their channel, so are you telling me that you, the host of, and I don't know what show it was, is that murdering a dog is worse than raping a woman? 
[00:59:30]  And he basically didn't come out and say it, but he said, hey, look at the crowd.  They're telling you it is.  You know what?  Jesus.  Think about it, though.  Yeah.  People really get upset when they see horrific things done to kittens, cats, dogs.  You run over a possum, though.  Who gives a shit?  It's that classic bit that Dennis Leary did that it's all about the cute animals that we care about, right? 
[01:00:00]  Dogs are cute.  I mean, it's rough to go on a radio show and say that it's worse than rape, but you've got to think that there's a lot of people out there that definitely get upset.  Yeah, yeah.  When it comes to cruelty to animals.  You know what it is?  There's a lot of animal rights activists that are very proactive, and they come out against anything that's cruel to animals.  There's not a lot of anti-rape people that are willing to come out and protest against rape, because you could just assume people don't like rape. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, of course.  You don't really have to push the issue like, we're against rape, we're against rape.  It's kind of assumed that people just don't like it.  And then you've got the counter-protesters across the street.  Boo!  Yeah.  Rape rules.  You know, it's not really something that needs a point to be argued.  We assume rape just isn't good.  You don't need a special interest group.  Right. 
[01:01:00]  I guess because, you know, maybe because dogs don't speak our language.  So someone has to speak for them.  Someone's got to speak for them.  And I think it's that fucking, what's-her-face there, that bitch on that goddamn team.  Look, if I've got to watch Sarah McLachlan one more time, do those commercials seem to take about five minutes?  What?  Sarah McLachlan.  Turn me on to something.  What do you got?  Sarah McLachlan.  Yeah.  And there's that lousy, crappy, sad music.  And she just talks about how poor dogs and kittens need your help, and they're abused, and they're in pounds, 
[01:01:30]  and they show poor dogs and poor kittens and Sarah McLachlan holding her dog.  Is she ever happy?  No!  Does everything have to be a sad song?  What, thank you, a miserable bitch.  She's just sad all the time.  Hi, I'm Sarah McLachlan.  And you know, dogs and cats can't speak for themselves.  We need to help them.  Hi, I'm Sarah McLachlan.  There are so many waiting for you in shelters everywhere. 
[01:02:00]  You need to contribute $80 a month, for your $80 will send you a picture of your dog and a t-shirt  and my album that no one seems to ever want to buy, yet I'm a huge success, and I have no idea why.  Am I a lesbian?  Was I at that lesbian concert?  Does she have to be reflected?  She made that concert.  Oh, I made the lesbian concert?  What, the Lily Fair, whatever the fuck it was?  Lilith Fair, yeah.  I said the Lily Fair.  What a dummy.  I like...  I'm stupid.  Bush.  I like beavers and pussies and everything else. 
[01:02:30]  Hack.  Does she have to be reflective all the time?  Don't stop.  One pop song.  24 hours a day, she's got to be reflective.  Give us a pop hit.  Fuck.  I'm reflective.  I'm Sarah McLachlan.  I've been having my period for two straight decades.  And there's just...  Now, during this song, and it is this song,  they will show a montage  of puppies and kittens.  Look, here it is.  There it is.  Just poor animals 
[01:03:00]  that have the saddest little eyes.  You know what?  But the dog they just showed,  is this from the commercial?  It might as well be.  That's probably...  They've got to be...  These dogs are not sad.  Oh, look.  No, that cat's got one eye.  All right.  The one-eyed cat.  Cat, cat, cat, cat, cat.  3,000 animals were rescued last year.  It is a problem.  Oh, oh, this dog can't even walk.  All right.  See, now look.  Now, look.  If that was a crippled person,  would you be going,  aw?  Who gives a shit?  We like our animals more than we do people. 
[01:03:30]  Well, it's like those commercials  to help kids with flies on them.  Yeah, yeah.  Nobody cares about that.  No one cares.  Oh, look.  It's a kitten.  It loves kittens.  They're adorable.  Jesus.  This proves my point, by the way.  The guy who has no friends is very lonely,  but you put a kitten in front of him,  he'll melt.  What the fuck is Bonnie doing?  That's not Bonnie.  It's Sarah McLachlan.  There is a resemblance.  Bonnie McFarlane.  Bonnie McFarlane.  There's a resemblance there. 
[01:04:00]  It kind of is.  Hey, Travis.  Could you please help this dog?  It's got huge teeth and it's stupid.  Most of these dogs look very happy.  Oh, look at the kittens.  Oh, my God.  I want to pick it up and put its head in my mouth.  You should get a kitten.  Get a kitten.  No, they get shit all over the place.  Get a kitten.  Hey, Travis, help me out.  Sarah McLachlan is always reflective.  Could you name some of her songs?  There's Building a Mystery.  What's the mystery?  Life.  Wait, what is Building a Mystery? 
[01:04:30]  I know the song, but what is it about?  Someone is building a mystery.  That's all I remember.  All right.  What big song?  Give me some more reflective Sarah McLachlan songs.  Give me some reflective Sarah McLachlan.  I Will Remember You is the reflective song.  Of course it is.  We all know that one.  We use it all the time when someone leaves the show.  Yeah.  Whether we want them to or not.  Sweet Surrender.  Sweet Surrender.  What are you surrendering to?  Right.  You just got to surrender to something, man.  When She Loved Me. 
[01:05:00]  When She Loved Me.  Can we sample one of these?  Sure, yeah.  Which one do you want?  The Arms of an Angel, which I'm ready to just slit my fucking wrists.  You've heard all these songs.  Have I?  Yeah, you can't avoid these songs.  They were huge.  Can you not?  I try.  I know.  What is this?  This is Sweet Surrender.  It's the same fucking song.  This is like a pop song for her.  Yeah, this might be one of her more upbeat songs, actually.  Yeah, this is a song for cutters. 
[01:05:30]  It really is.  All right, enough.  The Sarah McLachlan bit, it's not really going anywhere.  No, I really don't want to hear any more of her.  I thought it was really good.  But I'll tell you.  I thought it was really good.  I got to say, man.  My favorite SiriusXM channel right now, can't get enough of it, is that goddamn Coffeehouse.  Really?  Now, you might say, wow, what's wrong with you? 
[01:06:00]  What's wrong with you?  Well, they changed.  The Coffeehouse used to be very obscure and a lot of women on their periods singing.  For real.  Yeah.  And then I turned it on the other day because I wanted something mellow.  They tweaked it?  Dude, they tweaked it big time.  I was listening to Tangle Up in Blue by Bob Dylan, then a little acoustic fucking U2,  then a little John Mayer, and then into The Who.  So is it Coffeehouse?  Acoustic Who?  Is it Coffeehouse, like, meant to be an old-style Coffeehouse? 
[01:06:30]  Or like you sit in Starbucks watching a bunch of people on their computers?  Honestly, see, that's what you would think when you think Coffeehouse.  Yes.  Because we've all been in a Starbucks, and you want to hear about, you want to hear some  shit music that they play, just, you know.  Yeah, it's garbage.  I've never heard one song that they play in a Starbucks.  They should change the name of Coffeehouse because it doesn't represent what the channel's  all about.  Oh, fuck.  You're going to have to pay me.  God damn it!  Pay me!  It's a consulting fee.  How much?  Pay me!  How much?  This is a biggie, Ant.  Channel change?  That's $1,000.  Holy shit.  You owe me $1,000 fucking dollars. 
[01:07:00]  You're inflating your prices here.  Because it's a channel change.  That's big, yeah.  That's not just a little consulting, a little tweaking.  I'm fucking telling them to change the fucking channel.  You're blowing up the whole station.  Tangle Up in Blue.  How cool is this fucking song?  I'm not a big Dylan fan at all.  Dude, if you get too deep into Dylan, you get very, very lost without a GPS.  But Tangle Up in Blue.  You need GPS for Dylan?  But Tangle Up in Blue is a killer song.  Yeah.  Hold on, dude.  We're playing this whole fucking thing today, I just decided. 
[01:07:30]  So stop it.  We're going in a break with this in a second.  Stop it!  But Coffeehouse is now, it's all acoustic.  Okay, so it's like old school Coffeehouse.  Yeah.  That used to be cool in the village.  But then they'll throw on like an Indigo Girls.  And you're like, all right, I'm out.  Yeah, then you punch out.  Fuckers.  I'm moving on.  I don't think I've ever walked into a Starbucks and recognized a song that was playing.  No.  It's some obscure, like you said, just some fucking...  It's all female artists.  Yeah, yeah.  All on their periods.  All having a bad time with their life. 
[01:08:00]  And they're trying to work their way out of their situation.  Hey, look who's on the front page of the Coffeehouse when you go to Serious.  Uh-oh.  Video Sarah McLachlan.  Hey, look at that.  All right, look.  We're plugging Sarah McLachlan.  I'm going to get killed for saying I like Coffeehouse, but could you get me a playlist  just to prove my point?  Sarah McLachlan's on the front of Coffeehouse, Sophie.  All right, listen.  Dude, that's why...  In the arms of an angel.  You think I'm kidding.  That's why they need to officially hire me as a consultant.  I could retweak all these fucking channels. 
[01:08:30]  Raise your fucking price now.  $2,000.  Get Sarah McLachlan off the front page.  Two Gs.  Bad representation for Coffeehouse.  Now you're web consulting.  Here's some of the artists that you'll hear.  Fuck you, Danny.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  Danny's smirking.  He can't wait to get this out.  He's smirking.  He can't wait.  David Gray.  All right, hold on.  No.  Because David Gray is a little...  Come on.  No.  Chicks like David Gray.  How about this?  You need to go, girl.  Hold on.  Shut up.  Let's be fair about this.  I know where you're going.  Let's be fair about this. 
[01:09:00]  Let's be fair.  Give me the last hour of songs on Coffeehouse.  The last hour.  How do we do that?  Just played.  Because you're going to...  I know what you're doing.  You're picking and choosing, aren't you, Dan?  I know who your favorite is in this room.  I'm not stupid.  Oh, really?  Well, that's not very fair.  I don't think.  Did we pick teams at some point?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Did we, like...  Travis is still up for grass.  We have a team captains, and we picked...  Travis is up for grass.  I'll take Danny.  But I think you... 
[01:09:30]  I think...  You got Sam.  Yeah, I definitely got Sam.  You got Danny, but I'm...  You got Eric.  He's the superhero.  No, no, no, no.  You have E-Rock so bad.  Don't even...  Dude, you have E-Rock.  I would trade...  I would trade an E-Rock for Travis.  Travis?  No, I think I got Travis.  I think I got Travis.  Look who's in demand.  Yeah, but Travis kind of like...  Wow, look how he said that.  No, I think you got Travis, too.  I'm not stupid.  If we were picking teams, I think I have...  I definitely have Danny.  I think I got Travis. 
[01:10:00]  You have Sam, definitely.  And you definitely got E-Rock.  Dude, you're just stuck with E-Rock.  You have E-Rock's a bad kid.  He's the last guy to be picked?  No.  Who's got Steve?  Oh, shit.  You know something?  I think I might have Steve.  You have Steve?  Fuck.  Wait a minute.  Then I might have to go to Opie.  Although, wait a minute.  No, wait, wait, wait.  Because I have Danny on my team, I don't think I have Steve.  No, you can't have Steve if you have Danny.  Yeah, yeah.  That's obvious.  All right, give me the last hour of coffee.  Steve's sitting now.  How do we do this?  I got to figure out how to do that. 
[01:10:30]  All right, because I know, just name an artist, I lose.  I know that.  I know I lose if you just name artists that are on Coffee House.  Yeah.  And now everyone's going with the period jokes, because I like Coffee House.  How's your fucking period?  See?  You can't be honest on this show, ever.  Opie, what tampon do you?  Have you ever bought a CD from Starbucks?  I actually bought a couple from Starbucks.  Did you?  I bought the new U2 album from Starbucks.  I bought the best of Michael Penn, which was... 
[01:11:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  All right.  You scared the shit out of me.  And once in a while, they got a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've never seen a good one.  I'm sorry.  How do we get the playlist for Coffee House at the last hour?  I will challenge...  Oh, challenge.  Well, if we list the last hour of songs he played on Coffee House, you'd be hard to say...  Hard-pressed to say faggot?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's a way to put it.  All right. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  We're going to go to break.  Then let's...  We'll dig it up.  It's on its way.  Give me Tangled Up in Blue today.  I think that works today.  For what reason?  I don't know.  Bob Dylan.  At 10.30, is Steve going to run in?  Do you need the last half hour of Coffee House?  Jesus.  There's got to be a way to get it.  Isn't it in the system somehow?  It's more involved than that.  Is it really?  Why wouldn't it be?  All right.  If the guys could find it, great.  If not, no worries.  He'll find it.  But it's got to be the last hour.  Not Danny with the artist, because I'm...  Danny's just picking and choosing the fruitiest of the fruit songs. 
[01:12:00]  What were your first two?  David Gray and Indigo Girls?  I'm supposed to...  Indigo Girls.  How am I supposed to defend that?  I'm not making it up.  It's on the front page.  How am I supposed to defend that?  Along with the Sarah McCauley video.  Sarah McCauley's picture and video is on the front page.  Hey, Troy, you got it?  Troy's running in.  Troy Kwan.  He's not quite running.  Troy Kwan.  Everyone.  He's just kind of...  You got a Coffee House?  You lollygagged in.  Am I going to win?  You lollygagged.  Am I going to win this?  That's from yesterday.  All right.  That's fair enough.  That's all right.  Is this the whole...  I printed you out from...  All right, Ant.  I'll even say this. 
[01:12:30]  Thank you, sir.  Sure.  Thank you, sir.  He's right.  Give me an hour.  Because I don't even want to stack the deck here.  Okay.  From 12p to 9p, you give me an hour, and I'll pick that hour out of this pile.  I'm going to take afternoon drive 4 to 5.  4 to 5.  Give me 4p to 5p.  Oh, God.  This could be bad for me.  I'm just saying.  I'm getting nervous.  You getting nervous?  You getting a little edgy?  I want to hear you laugh before you say it.  I want to hear...  Oh, no. 
[01:13:00]  All right, pick another hour.  No!  I don't know half this shit.  Exactly.  I don't know half this shit.  Can you give me another hour?  No.  Oh, I have the last hour.  You want the last hour?  You want to go last hour?  All right, I'll forfeit my 4 to 5p.  All right, I'll tell you your 4p started with Jewel standing still.  Oh.  That isn't helping my cause.  How do you not know Jewel?  Someone named Peter Stewart.  I don't know that guy or band.  Then Lisa Loeb.  Hey, I missed you.  She's so hot.  Oh, you think Lisa Loeb's hot? 
[01:13:30]  That is so Danny's type.  What's wrong with her and Kennedy in a threesome?  That is so Danny's type.  Why?  Because of those stupid glasses?  I don't know what it is.  Danny loves chicks that he can take their glasses off and burn ants with them.  I don't know what it is.  As long as you can come in her glasses.  You bukkake.  Chris Barron?  Is that...  Who's Chris Barron?  It's Chris Barron.  That's not Spin Doctor Dude, right?  That's not a Chris Barron song.  Pardon Me.  Then Luca Bloom.  I lose bad. 
[01:14:00]  Who's that?  Then Jacob Dillon.  In Excess never tears apart.  But remember, it's all acoustic, so you're not hearing the actual studio version.  Paul McCartney, Vanilla Sky.  Miko, Under My Bed.  Wow.  Collective Soul.  Wow, I'm losing.  David Wilcox.  Maroon 5.  Indigo Girls.  There you go.  See?  You've got to play the fucking Indigo Girls every hour on this dumb channel.  That dumb channel?  I hate this channel.  I'm saying you're digging it these days.  All right, go with the last hour.  All right, the last hour. 
[01:14:30]  Before we put this to bed.  Coffee house.  Okay, starting with most recently played, and we'll go back from there.  And some of these artists are going to be unfamiliar because they do covers of really  cool songs.  Oh.  Which I like too, by the way.  Pump it up.  Because it's different.  All right, go ahead, Danny.  We got Mike Zito as the artist with Little Red Corvette.  See?  Doing a cover of Prince.  How is that?  That's what's kind of cool is to hear.  Is this it?  And I'm not even trying to.  This is a cover of Little Red Corvette.  But I'm not even trying to defend that.  When you hear like a newer artist covering a song you know very well, it kind of works. 
[01:15:00]  Okay, hold the phone.  I don't think I could take this.  I really don't think I can.  I don't think I've heard this one yet.  Let's see.  I want to hear what the vocals sound like.  Oh boy, turn off the instant feedback.  Please.  We'll turn it back on at 9 o'clock.  Well, I guess I should have known by the way you part your car sideways that it wouldn't last.  Wow, this guy really sounds urban.  You're the kind of person who believes in making out more.  This is something you'd hear in the subway. 
[01:15:30]  Like, the music is better, but.  I don't mind this.  I'm not going to.  You know what I mean?  But I don't hate it either.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Under certain circumstances.  Maybe fucking.  Is this fucking music?  This is what I put.  Fuck to this.  But I put Coffee House on when I'm editing my videos.  Yeah.  It's in the background.  What do you think for real?  This is too, like.  No, it doesn't.  It's not completely annoying me.  All right.  I don't.  I'm not. 
[01:16:00]  I would never put this on my iPod, and I got some real shit on my iPod.  Dude.  But.  All right.  All right.  Next.  Go right down the list.  Last hour on Coffee House.  No problem.  Next artist is Ray Lemontag.  You Are the Best Thing.  Oh, we're going to play every fucking song?  A little bit.  All right.  Sounds a little old Motown-ish.  Yeah, this is cool.  You want to just keep going?  You digging this?  Yeah, I like this stuff.  Oh, really?  This isn't bad. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Next up.  Gavin DeGraw.  I Don't Want to Be.  See, I don't know that.  I am, I am, I am.  I don't think it's the best thing I want to get.  What the fuck?  Ooh.  Wow.  Oh, this.  I like this stupid song.  It almost sounds like the Black Crow.  How hard did I ask?  I actually like this song a lot. 
[01:17:00]  I don't mind this either.  I didn't know who sang this.  I'd like to groove to this.  All right, continue.  I don't need the chorus.  Hold on.  It's called us right now.  The chorus is great.  This fall on the CW.  This has to be red, Ann.  You might have to red flag me.  Yeah.  Aaron Piper from Illinois. 
[01:17:30]  Sorry, Opie.  This does not replace fine-tuning that Sirius raped from us, dumb fuckers.  No, that's okay.  I completely agree.  No red flag there.  The best channel on XM was fine-tuning, hands down.  Fine-tuning.  They knew how to mix some old stuff and new stuff.  Legitimate classical music with, like, pop songs.  Someone's calling it homo-lite.  Yeah, I know.  Homo-lite.  All right, continue.  Tom Petty, time to move on.  Tom Petty's cool.  Oh, here's a good one.  Sean Colvin.  Sonny came home. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  I remember that dumb song.  You know what?  Maybe I just heard a good hour.  Maybe that's what it is.  Neil Young, Lotta Love.  That's a good song.  Tori Amos.  Yeah.  Tori Amos.  I'm looking at this hour, Ann.  Nah, whatever.  Check it out for yourself, I guess.  John Mayer.  Dave Matthews is up in there.  Dave Matthews.  Jewel.  All right.  Jewel. 
[01:18:30]  It's very mellow.  I'll give it that.  Yeah, it's...  You know, I'm not going to be driving 90 miles an hour listening to this shit.  No, I like my background music when I'm trying to, like, focus on other shit.  All right, why don't we play Tangle Up in Blues?  Something Different Today?  Or Tangle Up in Blue, I believe, is the...  He needed the money!  ...is the official name of this fine Bob Dylan song as we go to break.  Opie and Anthony today. 
[01:19:00]  Early one morning, the sun was shining.  I was laying in bed.  Wondering if she'd change at all, if her hair was still red.  Her folks, they said our lives together sure wasn't gonna be rough.  They never did like Mama's homemade dress.  Papa's bank book wasn't big enough.  And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes.  Heading out for the East Coast, Lord knows I played some dudes. 
[01:19:30]  Getting smooth.  Tangle Up in Blues.  She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced.  I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.  We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west. 
[01:20:00]  Spread up on the docks that night, both agreeing it was best.  And she turned around to look at me as I was walking away.  I heard her say over my shoulder, well, me to get someday on the avenue.  Tangle Up in Blues.  I had a job in the great Northwoods, working as a cook for a spill. 
[01:20:30]  But I never did like it all that much, and one day the axe just fell.  So I drifted down to New Orleans, so I was lucky with a bee employee.  Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix.  But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind.  I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind.  And I just grew, tangled up in blue. 
[01:21:00]  She was working in a topless place, and I stopped in for a beer.  I just kept looking at the side of her face, and the spotlight's so clear.  Later on, when the crowd turned out, I was just about to do the same.  She was standing there, in the back of my chair.  I said, Timmy, don't I know your name? 
[01:21:30]  I murdered something underneath my breath.  She studied the lines of my face.  I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down the ties and laces of my shoes.  She laid a burner on the stove, and offered me a pipe.  I thought you'd never say hello. 
[01:22:00]  She said you look like a silent type.  And she opened up a book of poems, and handed it to me.  Written by an Italian poet from the 13th century.  And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal.  Pouring off of every page, like it was written in my soul.  Fuck me to use.  Time to love your blues.  I lived with him on Montague Street, a basement down the stairs. 
[01:22:30]  There was music in the cafes at night, and revolution in the air.  Then he started into dealing with slaves, and something inside of them died.  She had to sell everything she owned, and it froze up inside.  And when it finally, the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn.  The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew. 
[01:23:00]  Trying to love your blues.  So now I'm going back again.  I got to get to her somehow.  All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.  Some are math petitions.  Some are carpenters' wives. 
[01:23:30]  Don't know how it all got started.  I don't know what they do with their lives.  But me, I'm still on the road ahead and go another joint.  We always would feel the same.  We just saw it from a different point of view.  Take a love for blue.  Take a love for blue.  We're not going to break because I got to defend myself. 
[01:24:00]  I'm getting guilt on the instant feedback.  Yeah, apparently.  What's the matter, Ope?  Is the Take 5 channel too hardcore for you?  Where else?  The channel doesn't need... 
[01:24:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Opey Coffeehouse doesn't need a playlist change.  It needs the name change to Fist Fucking Shit Dicks.  I figured it out, though.  What's next?  Yeah, what's next to this on your push buttons on your radio?  Liquid metal.  Out cue.  Fucking assholes.  No, I figured it out, though.  Because I'm reading the playlist for Coffeehouse.  I'm like, this is not what I was listening to.  Yeah.  And I was all confused because then I read the 4 o'clock hour. 
[01:25:00]  That didn't make me look good.  Then Danny read the last hour.  That certainly didn't make me look good.  And this guy explained it, and now I need to go another direction with this.  A Willful Boy from Jersey writes, Coffeehouse does an hour show of acoustic covers.  Very cool.  Maybe that's what you heard.  Oh, so you probably heard that.  That's got to be what I heard.  Because I knew every fucking song, and I'm like, holy shit.  Like, I was telling you during the Dylan song, Asia, I don't know if anyone was into Asia  back in the day. 
[01:25:30]  Man.  Something we all like to say back in the day.  Heat of the moment, acoustically.  I'm like, what the fuck?  That's pretty cool.  So we're listening to a specialty hour.  I think.  I think.  So if we can find the acoustic hour, the last acoustic hour they did.  Boy, you're covers.  You sure are putting a lot of conditions on this.  Dude!  Okay.  I think it's the last hour of this channel next to it.  Look, I'm like a listener like anyone else.  You turn on a channel, and you don't know what it's all about.  So if I hear an hour, and it's all cool acoustic songs, then I'm thinking this channel's 
[01:26:00]  really cool.  And then we look at the list, and it says Sean Colvin.  Lisa Loeb, fucking Sarah McLachlan, Indigo Girls.  I look like a flaming faggot.  By the way, Lisa Loeb, I think we got to go with Danny on this one.  Yeah.  We got an ass shot that is.  We got like a shot of her in a thong.  Jesus.  I mean, it's nothing to write home about.  No, no.  But it's fuckable.  Like she's, I think she's scraping 40.  You know what?  That's not bad, man. 
[01:26:30]  But see, you also got to.  Her body ain't bad right there.  Like, that ass standing straight up for someone pushing 40 is fine.  And then, of course, you do the, you know, she does the bend over.  The little walk thing.  Yeah, yeah.  No, the bend over.  Then it's over, Johnny.  You're digging the shit out of that, Danny, right?  Dude, I dig.  I like the Lisa Loeb, man.  I dig Lisa Loeb.  I don't know.  Danny is.  It bothers you.  It doesn't.  I don't know.  I still love when that fucking stay video would come on.  I'd be like, yes.  Really?  You like that one?  Lisa Loeb.  Let me see the lower right-hand picture. 
[01:27:00]  So who's your third?  Tina Fey.  I was going to say, it has to be Tina Fey, then.  Lisa Loeb, Kennedy, and Tina Fey.  Jesus.  They all just look like those.  They're like the geeky librarian.  Yeah, I was just going to say librarian.  I want to fuck Janine from Ghostbusters.  I don't understand why.  Annie Potts?  Yeah.  Something just fucking hot, man.  That's Annie Potts before anyone knew she was Annie Potts, right?  Yeah.  Fucking cute.  You think she's good in bed, Lisa Loeb?  Is she?  Who knows?  A girl like that, a nerdy librarian type girl? 
[01:27:30]  She's sensitive and giving.  In bed?  No fucking way.  I think she goes the other way, absolutely.  What, greedy?  Just rips the glasses off and says, you know, put it in my shitter.  Wow.  Would that be hot if a girl said that?  I'm not even sure.  I have to reflect on that for a minute.  Let me reflect on some Lisa Loeb music.  Like, is it hot if a girl turns to you and goes, put it in my shitter?  Can I answer first? 
[01:28:00]  Yes.  I think I would have to say that's hot.  That's real hot.  Like, there's different ways to say that as a girl.  But to just turn around and go, put it in my shitter.  She needs it so bad that she needs it in the dirtiest way possible.  So I would say, I would go with a yes on that end.  You'd go with a yes?  Yes.  All right.  I don't know.  You wouldn't be able to look at her afterwards, but.  Wouldn't you like the low kind of.  I only hear what I want you.  Put it in my ass. 
[01:28:30]  No, I think it's got to be hardcore.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because then you don't think she really means it.  Or when they ask.  She's doing that for your pleasure.  Do you want to put it in my ass?  That's pretty hot.  Those are going to be isolated, I see.  I see Travis marking.  Travis is doing a marking thing where he's marking my audio.  I'm totally screwed now.  And that one too, I guess.  Yeah.  I think if it's said in an angry way, that's kind of hard. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And is it.  Is she already on her belly looking over her shoulder at you?  What if she said, put it in my dirty shitter?  No.  No.  In my dirty shitter?  Now, is that still hot?  For some reason, that's hotter than just shitter.  Are you kidding me?  Yes.  Put it in my dirty shitter.  Jesus.  Ah, goddamn. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, that's it.  Dirt as shit as you're not.  I always thought that.  I always thought that.  Oh, goddamn.  That's funny.  Wait, now they're saying I want to listen to The Bridge.  What?  Get the fuck out of here.  That's got to be really lame.  Bridge.  Lisa Loeb does kid music now, doesn't she?  Really?  Is that what she's into now?  James, Virginia, what's The Bridge about?  It's soft classics. 
[01:30:00]  And they played that Bob Dylan song.  I was listening to it last weekend.  They played that Tangle Loving Blues song.  Just check the set list out on that one.  That's what you're looking for.  Maybe I had it on The Bridge.  Because I'm really confused about this.  It is awesome.  It's great.  You are about Obama backpedaling on this channel, dude.  We're all going to have to have a beer.  Yeah, let's all just have a beer together with the coffeehouse people.  And then we'll put it on some Dirty Shitter.  Dirty Shitter.  All right. 
[01:30:30]  Give me The Bridge.  Let's see.  I'll go through it real fast.  Does anyone remember The Bridge?  You got Paul McCartney.  Oh, by the way, something else I want to say.  Oh, my God.  What's the alternative station?  Holy shit.  Alt Nation.  Alt Nation.  If Kane's not DJing, I'm out.  Out.  If you want another consulting fee.  Holy shit.  Kane, 24 hours a day.  All right.  Now, it's not blowing up Alt Station, so how much?  Kane, 24 hours a day on Alt Nation.  How much?  Because when I turn on Alt Nation, and no, and I'm not attacking anybody else that might  be DJing on that station. 
[01:31:00]  Kane is the ultimate alt.  Alt jock guy.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah.  He's great in how simple he is between the records.  Another consulting fee.  You know, but all right, go ahead there.  Well, you got Paul McCartney, Maybe I'm Amazed, that just played.  I can handle that.  Gordon Lightfoot, Sundown.  Nice.  I could actually handle that.  Jackson Brown, Here Comes Those Tears Again.  Never liked Jackson Brown.  Well, no.  Never liked the Brown.  All right.  Well, come on.  Except for Lawyers and Love.  What? 
[01:31:30]  One of his hits.  I say that because I had to play that probably a thousand times on the radio.  What else?  Got David Crosby, Laughing.  I don't know if I know that song.  Probably not.  All right.  Leon Russell, Tightrope.  You know Tightrope?  Thinking.  I think I do.  If I heard it, I'd probably know it.  All right.  Elton John with Daniel.  Yeah, that's, you know.  Little River Band, Reminiscing.  Oh, my God.  We go dancing in the town.  Walking to the park and reminiscing. 
[01:32:00]  Ugh.  Fag song.  Can I put it in your dirty shitter?  And then we'll reminisce.  Yeah.  As I wipe shit off my dick.  This is.  What the fuck's wrong with me?  This is your fucking a woman over 45 music.  So you put this station on.  Yeah.  Put it in my dirty shitter.  That's what comes up when you put dirty shitter in.  Dirty shitter.  Play along at home. 
[01:32:30]  Put dirty shitter in the old search.  Jesus, Danny.  God damn.  All right.  We don't need pictures of dirty shitters now.  We don't need dirty shitter pics.  You sure?  I just want to make sure that's what you're referencing.  Well, I'm sure.  But I don't want to see it.  All right.  What else is on this list?  The bridge might be all right.  And now there's a different take on it.  There's a filthy toilet bowl.  Yeah.  Which, again, is still considered a dirty shitter.  That's a subway fucking bathroom right there. 
[01:33:00]  Jesus.  Lovely.  I think what disturbs me most about this picture is the ring of white around it that someone  actually probably sat on that.  Cleaned off.  Cleaned off.  Either that or it's the piss.  You got to look.  Oh, that's true.  They cleaned it off to add their shit to the bowl.  Because the thing doesn't flush anymore.  Well, if we're going back to the bridge playlist.  Yes.  We can move on to Bob Dylan with Forever Young.  Relatively newer Dylan song, even though it's probably... 
[01:33:30]  How old is that song now?  I mean, it's old, but it doesn't go way, way back.  Well, then you could do Linda Ronstadt.  You're No Good.  Never got the Linda Ronstadt.  Emmylou Harris, Easy From Now On.  Emmylou Harris has a killer voice.  Well, this is definitely a niche.  Yeah.  And they are sticking to it.  No kidding.  This is shit that, like, I probably wouldn't listen to.  Cat Stevens, Reddy, Harry Nielsen. 
[01:34:00]  Nielsen Schmilson off of Nielsen Schmilson.  Like, you know all the artists, but then they go real deep.  Yeah, they go really fucking deep.  Beatles, You Gotta Hide Your Love.  We know that song.  Deep into their filthy shitter.  That's right.  Steely Dan, Dirty Work.  That's a really cool song.  Hey, is that better?  What?  Fuck me deep in my filthy shitter.  Not filthy.  It still has to be dirty.  Filthy, actually.  Yeah, filthy.  Yeah, filthy.  Yeah.  Filthy over dirty.  Nice.  Now, it's hot? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  It's horrible.  50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.  Eww.  Eww.  Dan Fogelberg.  Ugh.  Make Love Stay.  Like, Richie Havens.  We know Richie Havens, but I never heard...  Freedom!  Yeah.  San Francisco Bay Blues.  Never heard that fucking song.  No.  Eh, whatever.  I guess they play songs that should have been on the radio as their thing.  Right?  Because the artists, you know, but I don't know many of those songs.  And these are like, I don't want to say hippie songs, but they're kind of hippie songs. 
[01:35:00]  They got a bit of a hippie thing going on there.  All right.  Maybe I just go back to my chill channel.  Eh, just chill.  Go back to chill.  Yo, chill.  Yo, chill.  I think Dylan wrote...  Try the loft.  Now you're...  Don't even...  Don't even...  The loft?  No.  No.  The loft?  Oh, here you go.  Yeah, Mongo's got it, I think, Ant.  Mongo the trucker.  Mongo.  Go.  Yeah, does Anthony like it when somebody says, put it in my greasy shitter? 
[01:35:30]  Greasy.  Only if they say greasy.  It can't be greasy.  Put it in my greasy shitter.  Now, if a really hot girl goes, put it in my dirty shitter, you're in.  But if that same hot girl said, put it in my greasy shitter.  My greasy shitter.  You're so fucking out.  You're like, oh my God.  Jesus.  I don't know.  You'd probably still do it.  Danny, that's a greasy shitter.  Yeah, but see, greasy shitter, the images aren't big. 
[01:36:00]  They're oiled up.  They're all oiled up nice.  They baby oiled their shitters.  Yeah.  Their shit.  We are...  We are just disgusting as a species.  Are we?  The listeners are right there.  Ziggy, DC.  What's up, Zig?  Yeah, if you've been dating a girl for a little bit, one, if you ask her, hey, can I put it  in your greasy shitter, the one thing you want to hear from her, don't want to hear  from her is, God, I thought you'd never ask.  You want to beg and plead and just do whatever you can to get in that ass. 
[01:36:30]  I thought you should get easy.  I thought you'd never ask.  You want there to be just an all-out struggle to get the job done.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to have her, like, offer it up like it's cake.  You don't want to have a discussion about having anal sex.  The next thing you know, she goes on all fours and spreads her ass cheeks.  You kind of want it to look like maybe she has no...  She's never done that before.  You barely say...  Like, you don't want to say, I wonder if I lock the back door and then have her hear 
[01:37:00]  back door and just spread her ass cheeks.  Exactly.  I go, no, you've misunderstood what I was saying.  You want there to be just a fucking sparring going on.  Yes.  You're trying.  She's, like, denying.  It's precious.  Yeah.  You want it to be a precious jewel.  And then finally, she can't help herself.  Yeah, yeah.  But after, like, an hour.  Yeah, an hour of getting her all sexed up and wild.  And then it's time for the filthy shitter.  But you don't want her just offering that up right off the bat. 
[01:37:30]  You don't want her to assume the position, you know, when you suggest it.  Yeah.  Jesus.  You don't want to get in the shitter while she's still wearing her bra.  Take an acting lesson, please.  Please just go to acting school for a weekend.  Let's say hi to Steve in Connecticut.  Steve.  Well, what about that Anthony's long assertion that you can add teen to anything and make  it hotter and dirtier?  Ah.  Stick it in my dirty teen shitter.  All right. 
[01:38:00]  See, I think that sounds better.  I think you got a point there, sir.  No one's going to argue with you.  I'm sure you've heard it many times before, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, we get it.  Thank you, sir.  Anthony likes teen girls.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dave in Colorado.  Who doesn't?  Dave.  Hey, good morning, boys.  What's up, Dave?  Why do we...  This has become a phone topic.  How is this a phone topic?  Real shows do real phone topics.  What do you think of Michael Vick being reinstated in the NFL?  How important is the filthy shitter? 
[01:38:30]  Right.  Go ahead, Dave.  Hey, I wanted to see if Anthony has the entire collection of Fuck My Dirty Shithole.  There isn't a porn collection called Fuck My Dirty Shithole, is there?  Yes, there is.  I used to work at a video store and we actually had a video store.  There it is.  There's the cover of Fuck My Dirty Shithole.  No, no, no, no.  Robert Blacks.  Robert Blacks.  Because he's got to get top billing, like Kubrick.  Like Kubrick.  Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. 
[01:39:00]  John Carpenter's Fuck My Dirty Shithole.  Robert Blacks.  Dot, dot, dot, the movie.  No, I think that was the soundtrack for a second.  That's right.  The dot, dot, dot should go between the movie.  Madula Oblongata, Fuck My Dirty Shithole.  Brian Atlanta suggested, you guys got to make female guests say,  put in my shitter from now on.  Yeah, female guests have to do that when they go out to do, like,  liners and stuff.  Brooke Hogan's in tomorrow.  Let's see if she... 
[01:39:30]  Promos for the show.  Do you think she would actually do that for us?  Would Brooke Hogan do that in a recording studio?  Or, no, we got to do it live.  No, no, they would never do it live, would they?  I'm thinking you just put it, you sandwich it in between,  hi, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, I want to say hi to little Jimmy Norton.  Happy birthday, Opie.  Happy birthday, Anthony.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, congratulations on five years with Sirius Satellite Radio.  Well, okay, not that one.  And put it in my filthy shitter. 
[01:40:00]  My filthy shitter.  Danny's having fun Googling.  What do you want?  Well, something else came up, so I want to play.  I want to play.  No way.  That is a porno movie.  I thought Century Sex was the greatest porn ever.  It's White Ghetto Films that put this out.  White Ghetto Films put out what?  I want to buttfuck your grandma.  100% hot gilfs.  100% anal action.  Grandma's. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, all right.  I like to F, right.  Yeah, featuring Rosarka,  Isida, Ivana, and Alice.  Alice.  Alice.  I'm going to put in your shitter, Alice.  Right in.  All fucking old Russian broads.  I want to buttfuck your grandma.  And the cover is fantastic.  It's an old grandma.  She's fat.  With the Bruno Sammartino wrestling shorts again.  Yeah.  She is not wearing,  those cannot be called panties. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  They are grandma panties, I guess,  but they look like, yeah,  old wrestler shorts.  Briefs or whatever.  Briefs.  I guess you can't even call them shorts.  And her tits are indescribable.  I can't describe.  I've never seen that.  She is a flatso.  But I've never seen that shape before.  No.  I can't even describe the shape of her boobs.  No, it's kind of a side shot  because she's kind of sideways showing her fat ass  and her head is kind of looking over her shoulder  as much as her arthritis will allow.  Dude.  She's turned around.  Look, if you cover this up,  tell me this is an old guy's... 
[01:41:30]  That's a guy.  That's a guy's butt.  That's a guy's ass.  But it's on I want to buttfuck.  It's white ghetto films.  I want to buttfuck your grandma.  Well, yeah.  They're very proud of their film companies and names.  That's just like...  That's fantastic.  And two,  there's on I want to buttfuck your grandma too  for any of the unanswered questions  that there were so many of from one.  Oh, we got a couple more.  Third one in 3D.  Let's go to Nate in Arkansas.  Nate. 
[01:42:00]  Fuck my rancid fart box.  No way.  Yeah, that would be a little...  I want to buttfuck your mom is also on  I want to buttfuck your mom too.  Jesus.  White ghetto films.  Not too.  That's too.  Not also like they did with Teen Wolf 2.  Yeah, white ghetto loves the butthole.  Steve.  No, let's...  Bill in Jersey.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Hey, Anthony.  How about fuck my leaky shitter?  Oh, my God.  Meeky leaky. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Is it time for break finally?  Yeah, I think we can take a break now.  You want to hear another song?  Yeah.  I'm trying to think what would be a cool song  to play right now.  How about Ant Picks One?  Oh, my God.  I can't pick a song.  Pressure's on.  Because I'm terrible.  We're like going with that acoustic thing today.  Give me a cool acoustic song.  I'd have to go with the basic...  We can play Shit Dick.  Shit Dick.  Is there an acoustic version of I'm an Ass Man? 
[01:43:00]  I'm an...  Or the Dude Love song?  Dude Love.  God, was that awful.  I guess we don't do any music going into this.  Oh.  That's sad.  I want to come inside your grandma.  It's another movie from White Ghetto Films.  Yeah.  Wow.  She needs a shaven.  Yeah.  Eh.  Maybe if I think of it, I'll blurt it out later.  A little later then.  Yeah.  Something like some acoustic song from that acoustic hour. 
[01:43:30]  Give me that acoustic hour.  Acoustic hour.  Could play...  No, here at the moment would be too obscure for everybody.  Oh, is that doctor in trouble?  We're going to give you the Michael Jackson update.  Oh, yeah.  Obama's doing that beer thing.  And man, if you guys want to see a horrendous picture of Madonna...  Really bad?  I think...  Was it our boy?  I think so, yeah.  WWTDD.com gets a nice plug today.  WhatWouldTylerDurtonDo.com would type in WWTDD.com.  There you go, Ant. 
[01:44:00]  Look at that picture of Madonna.  It's worth going to the website.  What's with her arms?  I don't know.  Dude, what's with her arms?  I think she doesn't have a hint of body fat on her.  There's no body fat.  But works out so much that she's ripped.  So all you see is muscles and ligaments.  But they're not even big.  So you need a little fat in there just to kind of bring it all together.  Hell yeah.  And even in that case, she would still look like a man because she would...  Oh, look.  They're showing it on TV as we show it.  Holy shit.  It's everywhere, this picture. 
[01:44:30]  It's worth a...  Should I tweet it?  She must hate that.  Go to WWTDD.com.  She is the material girl.  I don't want to take the credit.  You know, he needs the hits today.  Go there and see the picture of Madonna.  Oh, and who is that?  I don't know.  This Miranda.  Holy shit.  Punch this up.  I'm in fucking love.  Dude, this chick is ridiculous.  Who is this?  Miranda.  She's on WWTDD.com.  WWTDD.com.  But where did she come from?  They didn't just like fucking take a picture of her on the beach and see some girl.  Who needs to fucking read?  What is she from?  Who cares where she's from?  I got to know so if I could maybe meet her. 
[01:45:00]  She was...  By the way, this proves that girls don't need big fucking tits to the guys out there that  have the tits.  Holy shit.  The tit obsession.  You got to see this girl.  She's got small boobs.  She's a model?  It just doesn't matter.  Victoria's Secret.  Holy shit.  Secret model.  Topless.  WWTDD.com.  I have a new favorite girl ever.  That's the picture right above Madonna if you're going to the website today.  Are there any more pictures of her?  Yeah, a bunch.  Holy shit.  Look at the pink panties.  All right, look. 
[01:45:30]  She's wearing...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  My new favorite girl ever.  Yeah, she's all right, man.  I'm just...  Who's the hag in the background?  Get out of the picture!  Look at her.  She's just fucking standing in the water, people all around, topless, looking amazing.  She's holding her hat down a little bit.  I love the women in the background. 
[01:46:00]  They are so pissed off.  That looks like the fucking sniper in full metal jacket behind her.  Oh, God damn.  Look at that.  Head to toe.  What's going on there?  Wow.  Would you put a baby in her belly?  Holy shit.  If she turned around and said, fuck me in my AIDS-infested, filth-ridden, ganky, fucking  stankhole shitter, I would. 
[01:46:30]  All in?  I'd go, I have to lick it first.  Oh!  Well, that's an odd picture.  I don't like that at all.  Why?  Because a cheek crept out of her little shorts, and it looks funny.  Yeah, sometimes-  That's just a bad shot.  Sometimes the cheek, yeah.  That's just a bad shot.  Popping out like that looks a little weird.  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  With the blue eyes?  Yeah.  Piercing.  Piercing blue eyes.  Piercing.  All right.  There you go, fuckers.  Look what we did for you today.  Wow.  WTDD.com. 
[01:47:00]  Let me know if you had to jerk off.  I could fucking rub a batch out to that in this room right now in front of everybody.  That's all right, Ed.  No?  We'll take your word on that one.  All righty.  Break time.  Damn.  Break time.  Whatever, man.  We're just all-  Whatever.  Just let me do this.  I've got to do this now.  Go back to Madonna so we all come back to reality.  Yeah, really?  There's another one.  Let's see where it goes.  Another hottie? 
[01:47:30]  No, don't even ruin it.  Why would you ruin it with another one?  Just let that one win.  She might be great.  Yeah, just let that one sit down.  I forget what side it was on now.  See, now I'm going to have to minimize this, open up a window in front of my computer,  go to Google Images, and just put her name in, and stare at her picture the entire show.  The girl we just saw, right?  The Sports Illustrated swimsuit model.  Victoria's Secret.  Victoria's Secret, sorry.  Victoria's Secret.  Topless.  With the pink panties.  Hotter than Megan Fox?  Yes.  Yeah, I think so. 
[01:48:00]  Yes.  Yes.  I didn't even have to think on that one.  Yes.  And Megan Fox is, I love the people that don't think Megan Fox is.  Oh, she's all right.  Oh, my God.  Who's this?  This sucks.  You're blowing it, Dan.  Who is she?  That's Emma Watson.  Oh, no, she's old.  Wait a minute.  Actually, that's not bad.  Get out of here.  She got, well, how big are her tits now?  Yeah, but she's got youth on her side.  Yeah, she's going to be a dog.  I don't know.  She's going to be a dog in a couple years.  She's English, so she'll have bad teeth, but. 
[01:48:30]  You think they finally have good dentistry in England?  No, they don't.  And we're just dumb Americans?  They're still battling the scurvy with limes.  When you go over on British Airways, they give you limes.  Holy mother of God.  This is what we play to break.  I'm done.  We might as well just stop the show.  We just did two hours.  I have this Miranda on my.  By the way, I'm going home early today because I got to play golf.  Jesus Christ.  I got to play with myself.  Wow.  Wow.  Who's this?  The same girl?  Oh, boy. 
[01:49:00]  Is that the same girl?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just.  It's.  It's.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  That is a great picture.  I got to get it right now.  I am.  For you, Ant.  For you.  Oh, my God.  That.  For you, Ant.  Yeah.  Look at the picture.  Listen to the song.  Oh, my God.  Miranda.  Oh, faster.  Miranda Kerr. 
[01:49:30]  I want to fuck your filthy, dirty shitter.  I would.  I would love to.  Don't stop treating me.  Oh, yes.  Miranda.  I would.  I would spread your cheeks apart.  Oh, oh, oh.  That's me putting it in.  Oh, oh.  I'm enjoying her.  Filthy shitter. 
[01:50:00]  Filthy shitter.  Wow.  I can't.  Oh, my God.  Oh, oh.  Where did this girl come from?  She came out of the blue.  This one just came out of the blue.  She could be hotter than that other Victoria's Secret model.  The one with the dark hair and the blue eyes.  I forget her name always.  Is she American?  Yeah, I don't know.  Can't be.  All these chicks are from somewhere else. 
[01:50:30]  Russia or something.  Yes.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm putting it in your filthy shitter.  You don't mind, do you?  You don't mind it in your filthy shithole, do you?  Do you?  Yeah?  Is that good?  Stop whining.  Man, really strange.  I found one person.  Oh, wait.  Oh, I was going to give a presidential address about her shitter. 
[01:51:00]  I found a person that's really not into this.  What?  This new chick.  Oh.  I don't care.  I don't care.  That makes sense.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  Did you turn this up?  Wow.  For Anthony?  I am amazed by her.  It's in love.  I need.  I'm going to stalk her, I think.  Oh, Miranda.  Miranda Kerr.  I want to take you and put it in your smell hole. 
[01:51:30]  Can I just jam it in your smelly stink hole?  Do you want to kiss me?  Did you see the one where she's laying on her side, Danny?  I saw all of them.  With her foot up and her ass is completely, she's completely naked and her ass is showing.  It's an amazing ass.  Go back to Google Images.  Now go down.  Scroll down.  On the first page?  Yeah.  Go down. 
[01:52:00]  Go where?  Oh, my God.  Where are you?  What page are you on?  I just put Miranda in.  Somebody's saying that Miranda Kerr is her name.  Yeah.  Her fart box.  Yeah.  She's hot, but her ass isn't great, this guy's saying.  Okay, look at this ass.  That ass isn't great, really?  Everyone's a critic.  Really, Puddle of A's?  What's wrong with you?  Hey, Puddle of A's, let me see your chick's ass.  Send a fucking photo.  Everyone's a critic.  We just gave the-  How can you criticize this chick's ass? 
[01:52:30]  We gave these people two great hours of radio, and there will be an asshole out there saying  how we suck today.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  Why always a critic?  Why are we trying?  This chick is ridiculous.  All right, I'm leaving.  Where are you going?  I was going to go home.  Yeah, I'll go, then.  No?  I don't have to be here anymore.  I got that fuck you money.  Bobby Lee backstage with Sam.  That's what we do here.  As I just crank to this.  By the way, the Bobby Lee video is doing very well on my YouTube channel, Opio Radio. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Go there if you want to see Bobby Lee having panic attacks on the air and off the air.  Perfect.  So she's not naturally a blonde, huh, Dan?  No, it doesn't look like that.  No.  It looks like she's-  In the pictures on www.dd.com, he's going to get a lot of hits right now.  She looks fantastic blonde, though.  I'll tell you that much.  She looks good as a brunette, too.  I like the light brown, almost a dirty-  Holy shit.  That face is fucking stunning. 
[01:53:30]  If I turned around and she was in the street walking, and I turned around, and all of a  and she was face-to-face with me, I'd go, die, die.  I found a flaw.  Holy shit, go back.  What flaw?  This-  That's the best picture, right?  Which, which, which?  Ooh.  Go-  Oh, so you can't see.  Second column.  Second column.  Yeah.  Down one more.  Right there.  Face.  Wow.  I listen.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Found a flaw, though. 
[01:54:00]  What's the problem?  Not a big fan of the cleft chin on a broad.  What cleft chin?  She's got a little, she's got a thing.  Does she?  She's got a little thing.  It's a jizz trough.  It guides the jizz right between her tits.  You know what?  No, I don't see a cleft.  No, there was one picture you showed she had it, and every other picture she doesn't.  No, that was John Travolta.  I'm mistaken.  All right, we'll go to break with this.  I did find a flaw, though.  Yeah?  She does have a duty beauty mark, a duty mole on her ass cheek.  I hate duty beauty marks. 
[01:54:30]  Lower right ass cheek, right by where the thigh meets the ass.  Let me see.  If you look on the right leg.  Beauty marks?  Okay, as long as they don't look like the duty.  It's a little duty-ish.  Like a speck of duty.  It's a little duty.  I think they probably airbrushed it out of that.  Yeah, they would airbrush it out of that one.  That's a glamour shot.  You got to get one where she's in a bikini like on the beach.  Or maybe even that one up top, right there.  Let's see that one.  Let's see if she has a duty.  Now let's just, we put her up on the pedestal.  Now let's rip her down.  Now let's just rip her down from that pedestal. 
[01:55:00]  Are we allowed to, like, Google bomb duty, duty stain beauty mark?  Oh, yeah, there it is.  See, there it is.  Oh, let me see.  There's a little duty.  She can use a little more hiney.  She's very skinny, which is, you know, models tend to go up and down like that.  Wow.  You just ruined it with that duty stain beauty mark.  The duty ruined it?  You don't like her duty on her?  It's a duty mark.  But it's right near her filthy shithole.  I know.  That's what makes it a little weird, too. 
[01:55:30]  It's a little too close.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Damn.  Maybe if it was on her, I don't know, her belly or something.  She's got a very Mila Kunis thing happening because, like, she's ridiculously hot and I'm  sure she's even hotter in person.  Mila.  Yeah, yeah.  But, like, I mean, Mila's so much hotter in person than she's on TV, but, like, that ass is  just...  Where'd you see her?  When Family Guy was live at Radio City Music Hall.  Mila's got a real flat ass.  Yeah.  Like, that girl's ass is small, but it doesn't look as flat. 
[01:56:00]  It's a little elephant-y.  It's got that flat kind of hat.  Just a little bit.  Very, very slow.  How old is this?  No, it's very disappointing when you...  Like, this Miranda girl who looks ridiculously, you know, whatever.  If you saw her in person, know what the big disappointment is?  When she walks in...  She doesn't acknowledge me?  Well, that, but she walks in the room and you realize she's 6'5".  Has that ever happened to you when you see someone that you think is really hot and you  see them in person and they're so tall it takes them out of the game. 
[01:56:30]  You're like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm looking at a picture of her now here.  All right.  All right.  Now that...  Oh, yes.  There's the duty mark.  There's 5'9", by the way.  There's the duty mark.  She's 5'9".  That's nice.  Very, very attractive.  And this one will send you over the edge here.  George in Cleveland.  Hey, I wanted to let Ann know I read an article and I believe she's still a virgin.  Ann, Ann.  Jesus, Ann. 
[01:57:00]  What?  What?  You're right.  Hold on.  Shit, I fell down.  Ann fell down.  What?  Kenny, can you pick up Anthony, please?  He fell down.  God, what happened, Ann?  Thank you, George.  All righty.  I think I shut my mic off.  There it is.  Oh.  Jersey Matt says, I'm right, that he has a problem with the chin, too, and he thinks  that they're airbrushing out the clef in a lot of the shots.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  That's just... 
[01:57:30]  That is fucking enraging.  I am enraged looking at that, knowing it will never be mine.  That's for sure.  Wow.  I used some different terms.  I used...  In Anthony's jerkingofftothislater.com?  Try Miranda Kerr.  That's K-E-R-R.  Virgin.  Oh, my God.  That's page one of Google Images.  Which one are we looking at for the people at home?  Second row, second picture.  Yeah, bikini one where she's kind of three quarters. 
[01:58:00]  Jesus.  Fucking ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  It's just ridiculous.  Wow.  Someone's saying that on her website, she's got videos.  No, she doesn't.  Yeah.  Let me look at that little duty spot.  Holy shit.  What are you talking...  What's wrong with her ass?  No, it looks better than her ass.  No, that was a bad picture.  Duty spot.  That was a bad picture.  Duty spot.  That's a little rough.  She's got the duty spot.  Yeah, that's a little rough.  I would lick the duty spot.  No, you're talking about the duty stain beauty mark.  The duty stain... 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She's got...  As we Google that today.  Yeah.  Duty stain beauty mark.  Duty stain beauty mark.  Yeah.  I would lick her duty stain beauty mark, and then I would totally jam my tongue in her  shit or in her shitter.  Yeah, she's all right.  You think she makes a few bucks modeling?  I think she might turn a couple of bucks.  A few bucks.  15, 20 bucks an hour.  Should we break?  Yes, I have to lick my shit.  We just did two hours and 10 minutes.  All right, I'm just going to look at her. 
[01:59:00]  All right, we'll do the Bobby Lee backstage one more time for everybody.  Bobby just panic attacks.  On air, off air.  Forbidden.  Fuck you.  Ran out of the studio.  No way.  No way, no how.  I'm going to hit this as we continue looking at Miranda.  Miranda Kerr.  Miranda Kerr.  No way.  Thank you, Kenny.  You're welcome.  You think she's hot, Kenny?  Who is she?  She's a model.  Hang on, hang on.  Oh, my God. 
[01:59:30]  Wait a minute.  Let me show you a better one, Ken.  Yeah, Ken.  You deserve only the best for Ken.  Yeah, give him the best Miranda Kerr picture.  It could have been that one when you put the virgin thing in.  Yeah, yeah, that's where I'm going.  Wait a sec.  Yeah, that's a good one.  You put the virgin thing in.  That was, uh...  That's, uh, fantabulous.  Yeah, this.  Thank you, Kenny.  You think this goes...  Kenny?  I only have eyes for my wife.  Holy shit.  But what about your dick? 
[02:00:00]  You're not allowed to say that she's hot?  Come on.  Look at her!  Would you get in trouble for saying she's hot?  Look at that unibrow!  Unibrow?  What's wrong with you?  What are you looking in?  A mirror?  Come on.  She's got a very punchable face.  Punchable face?  You're just an ass.  Or an ass.  Look at...  Oh, my...  Good hiney for a nice roundhouse kick.  Kevin from Connecticut.  This is making me laugh.  Oh, my God.  How funny would it be if Miranda... 
[02:00:30]  Miranda, Miranda Carr was three foot...  Three foot six inches tall.  It would be hysterically funny as I fuck a midget.  Because I would be all over this.  All over it!  Would you give up your gun obsession for her?  Just put...  You could put anything in.  Would you give up?  And then just put in whatever you want.  Would you have black friends?  Would you toss a salad to get to that?  Oh, that's a good question. 
[02:01:00]  Would you toss a salad of a convict to get to her?  Can I use her to cleanse my palate?  We allow you to use grape jelly or syrup, by the way.  You guys kind of took that to a place I didn't think we were going.  I thought it'd be like material things like my car.  Well, we still need an answer.  Or things like that.  Toss the salad of a convict, but you could use grape jelly or syrup to get to her.  All right, let me...  One and done, by the way.  One time, and then she says, I'm yours forever.  No, you have to get past the convict. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, oh, and then I have her...  Yeah, explain this one.  Let's see how smart you really are.  Let me think.  Toss in the salad of a convict.  Toss the salad of a convict.  After you worked out.  After he worked out.  But you could use the jelly or the syrup.  Just keeps it getting worse, doesn't it?  Yeah.  And then...  Oh, my God.  For that.  And then you get that for the rest of your life.  All right.  I'm mouth deep in convict ass.  Faggot!  You dummy. 
[02:02:00]  Here's Bobby Lee backstage.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and comedian Bobby Lee stopped by the Opie and Anthony show and  had a panic attack after looking at Stalker Patty's butthole live in the studio.  As Bobby tried to escape the building, we shoved a mic in his face.  Bobby, you're leaving already.  What happened?  No, it's just...  It's not... 
[02:02:30]  Nothing.  Yeah.  What do you mean, nothing?  You left before.  That's what happened.  Why?  What do you have to do?  Well, because I don't like any of it, but I'm just trying to pretend that I like it  because I want to be cool, you know?  Yeah, and then...  But then it's like the real reality sinks in, and it's not cool, you know?  Was it...  So you don't feel like you're one of the cool kids?  No, I am one of the cool kids, but it's just like, you know, it's like deception, man.  What about Stalker Patty?  I don't know.  I don't know any about that.  I've never heard of it.  I don't know anything about that.  You know what I mean?  She was totally naked.  I don't know, but I don't know anything about it, you know? 
[02:03:00]  She hadn't shaved in a month.  I know, I know.  It's like a jungle.  I know, I get it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'll see you next year, man, you know?  You're leaving for a year.  That's it.  Well, I know.  I come back every year.  And now you're...  Now, can I say something right now?  Yeah.  I was fine when I left.  Now I'm back because of you.  Why?  We're just talking.  It's because I don't know what you're doing right now, man.  We're talking.  I don't know where this is going.  I don't know what you're doing.  After comments like that, it became clear that in order to gain closure, we would have  to follow a panic-stricken Bobby Lee down the elevator.  It's been fun. 
[02:03:30]  I guess it's a pleasure.  All right.  Yeah, I guess so.  You're coming down with me?  I guess so.  Get out of here.  No, get out of here, man.  No.  What are you doing?  You get out of the elevator.  No, no, no.  I don't like it.  I just make sure you get out of there.  All right, but this is what I'm going to do.  Once I get outside of the building, I'm running.  And I don't want to run.  No.  But you're making me do it.  Okay.  All right.  Do you like the building?  I mean, it's a nice elevator.  Whatever, man.  What's wrong?  Nothing's wrong, man.  I don't understand.  You're being so closed off right now.  I'm in an elevator.  There's two things.  Elevators and now this.  What's wrong with elevators?  You don't like elevators?  This guy is bigwig at the Carolines, man. 
[02:04:00]  Greg Charles?  Greg Charles.  That's his real name.  But my point is, I want to get booked back.  Yeah.  And now they think I'm crazy.  But they like that.  They think I'm a lunatic.  I'm not a lunatic, man.  But it's okay.  Like, you know, you're eccentric.  Right?  You're a comedian.  Yeah.  I'm just a guy who, you know, tries to survive in the world.  Oh, my God.  You're running away.  Bye, Bobby Lee.  Apparently, he doesn't like interviews as Bobby Lee literally ran across the lobby of  the building and out onto 6th Avenue. 
[02:04:30]  Hopefully, he'll manage to recover enough to be completely broken down again the next  time he stops by the show.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  Are we on?  Well, we could be.  Are we on or no?  No.  Yeah, you're on.  I just like, see, we had some dead air there.  Wait, are we on, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're on.  For real?  Yeah, because the system petered out, as they say. 
[02:05:00]  And it didn't play the rest of the stuff it was supposed to play.  So, we were just kicking back, listening to the sounds of silence for a while.  Not knowing that we could have filled that up with our voices.  Yeah, we could have filled it up with talking.  But I made this a lesser of a problem.  I liked watching Travis.  Travis was throwing his arms up in the air.  Then he did this.  He did.  Imagine you had a sock puppet without the sock.  He moved his hand like that to me, like, talk.  Like, you guys talk.  So, I just looked at him and did it back to him. 
[02:05:30]  I did the hand puppet back to him, which did nothing.  There's still dead air.  And then people started running down the hallway.  I don't know why I didn't just turn my mic on and tell you guys that you're running.  But you could have done that.  Well, we're going from one system to another.  What are we on, profit or something?  Profit.  Yeah, big profit.  Whatever the fuck that means.  Danny, you didn't change the page, did you?  It's the only profit around this place.  It's a joke.  Get it?  I got to tell you, man.  We've been laughing for probably the last ten straight minutes.  Pete Bradshaw, thank you.  He's in Connecticut.  He writes.  We're talking about this girl. 
[02:06:00]  Miranda Kerr.  Kerr.  K-E-R-R, right?  Yeah.  She's Australian.  This is what Pete writes.  Of course she is.  She's 5'9".  She's dating Orlando Bloom.  This is where it gets really good.  Listen to this.  And we got an article that's just making us chuckle, man.  And she is the sole reason that he's not going to be in Pirates of the Caribbean 4.  And then Kevin from Connecticut writes,  when it comes to Miranda Kerr, I would drag my ball, my ball.  I guess there might be a problem with Kevin. 
[02:06:30]  Just one ball?  I would drag my ball across 50 feet of broken glass just to lick the tire of the garbage truck that took her used tampon away.  So then we find an article.  And, Danny, this is where we need you.  Sam found this as you were liquid shitting or whatever the fuck you were doing.  This is atrocious.  Read this.  If you're wondering how hot this girl is, and maybe you can't be near a computer because you're driving or whatever, this will prove it all right here.  Read the Miranda Kerr article. 
[02:07:00]  Sure.  Actor Orlando Bloom has ruled himself out of another episode of Hijinks on the High Seas for a successful film franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean,  primarily because the romantic star did not want to leave stunning girlfriend Miranda Kerr.  See that?  All right.  Let that just sink in.  Yeah.  Orlando Bloom is a movie star, as we all know, that could have any girl on the planet.  This is how hot Miranda Kerr is.  He's too scared to film a huge movie.  One of the biggest movie franchises ever because he doesn't want to leave his girlfriend alone. 
[02:07:30]  He's petrified that she is going to be fucking someone else.  Yeah.  That's the—why wouldn't you do Pirates of the Caribbean?  Huge franchise.  Orlando Bloom basically said, fuck my movie career.  Yeah.  I can't take a chance of leaving this girl by herself.  I'm gone.  I cannot leave.  I cannot—first of all, I can't leave that pussy.  Can't leave it.  Uh, because, you know, he wants to use it. 
[02:08:00]  Secondly, can't leave it alone.  Someone's going to take that from me.  Yeah.  It's like leaving a giant fucking elk carcass on the Serengeti.  And hoping it's there when you get back.  I'm going to leave for a while, but I hope when I get back, this fucking water buffalo is still here.  Now, you guys, don't touch it.  Don't touch it.  I'll be back.  It's mine.  I'm coming back for that.  I was the one that took it down.  It's mine.  I have to leave for a little while.  Right.  Got something to do.  Right.  But I'm coming back, so leave this—why didn't you leave it alone? 
[02:08:30]  Right.  I can still see you.  Yeah.  She's so—  That is how hot this—that's how hot this girl is.  Yeah.  Orlando Bloom has just pretty much said, fuck movies.  Fuck my movie career.  Pirates of the what?  I never heard of it.  That hack—that hack movie?  Who cares?  Who cares?  I never wanted to be a part of it.  I'm moving on to more artsy films.  Right.  Small films.  You know, me walking with my chick.  Right.  Me barbecuing with my chick.  Me on a balcony with my chick. 
[02:09:00]  Right.  Things like that.  By the pool with my chick.  Is there anything else in that article?  That was pretty much the—  That's the gist of it.  That's the gist of it.  Yeah, that's the gist of it.  All right.  It's a very long article on how Orlando Bloom will not be doing any more Pirates of the Caribbean movies.  And, by the way—  Wait.  There is some more news.  He could get any fucking girl he wants.  Yeah, on the planet.  Orlando Bloom could go and get any fucking chick he damn well pleases.  Obviously, he scooped this one up.  Hang on.  Yes.  Yeah.  She has already twice turned down his marriage proposals. 
[02:09:30]  Oh.  But he plans to ask her again this summer.  A source—  A source—  He's begging.  He's begging to tie this one up.  A source told the mail on Sunday earlier this month, he has told her he wants to marry her and will propose again this summer.  If she says no, he said it will be over.  Yeah, right.  Bullshit!  Yeah, fucking right.  You don't propose twice, get a no, say it again, and then it's going to be over.  Just stop.  That proves this girl knows how hot she is. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  She's playing Orlando Bloom.  Yeah.  She's playing him.  Let's say hi to—  Look at a runway model picture of her in a yellow bikini that is just fucking retarded.  It's fucking retarded.  Jesus.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Brandon in Boston.  Brandon.  Concentrate.  Brandon.  Hey, Bart.  Such a boner.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Uh, it's on the website that 25 lists of, uh, top emasculated men, and your boy Kevin Smith is on the list. 
[02:10:30]  Kevin's on the list.  Why is he on there?  I didn't read the article.  I was kind of shocked that he was on there, because you got guys like that basketball player who's white, follows him around everywhere on there.  Oh, remember him?  Who was that again?  Uh, fuck, who was it?  I can't remember his name.  They did a piece on 60 Minutes, 20, 20, whatever, one of those shows.  It was hilarious.  She just, like, follows him everywhere.  She follows him around on the road.  Then trust him.  And the whole team is fucking pissed off, because if you know anything about these athletes, they got, they got, they got Bettys in every, every city. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  And now you got, you know, the star player's, uh, girlfriend or wife, whatever, following the team.  So not only could that guy not cheat, the rest of the team can't cheat, which is, which is really pissing off the whole team.  What was her name?  You know the rest of the wives are calling that guy.  Huh?  You know the rest of the wives are calling his wife, too.  Of course.  Oh, that's fucked up.  Where's that list?  I would love to see who else is on the list.  I think it's this.  It was on Jake.com.  That's where I found the link.  Okay, we'll check it out.  Thank you, Brandon. 
[02:11:30]  And I appreciate it.  Thank you.  All right.  There he goes.  Watch out.  Uh, who's on that list?  Well, this, I don't know if it's the same one that we're talking about, but this is a GQ list called the whipped list.  The whipped list.  And, uh, number one is Guy Ritchie.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  He moved on.  Christine.  Ant, you're just lonely.  Stop looking at the TV.  Is that what it is?  You're just lonely.  I was just looking.  Now, I got to get a better view.  I got to get, get it off of this friggin' chick. 
[02:12:00]  She never did anything wrong to you.  No, I know.  I'm just killing anybody.  She was always very nice to you.  Let me look.  All right.  All right.  Get off of that.  We're looking at Ant's old girl on Channel 11 for, just looking at the, um, for the newbies.  Darker hair.  Used to go out with the traffic girl.  Something about the darker hair.  That's kind of.  Maybe she's just really happy.  Sorry to say.  Maybe she's in a very healthy relationship.  Maybe that's it.  And it's showing.  Maybe it's showing.  That's terrible.  Sorry.  That's probably true. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, it was Doug Christie?  Matt from, uh, D.C.  Doug Christie, right?  Good evening.  Good evening.  Was it?  Was it?  Yeah, it's Doug Christie.  Oh, that's the name you're looking for.  His wife's like a crazy, like, Christian following him around all over the place.  Could we?  I know it's old audio, but if the guys could find it down the hall, it really is fun.  It's funny because it was just a nightmare for the rest of, uh, the rest of the players  that she was doing this.  Now I see why Kevin Smith, though.  Why?  Because he casts his wife in movies.  Oh, well, she's beautiful, man. 
[02:13:00]  I saw her at a devil's playoff game.  Oh, my God.  But that's why they would put him in that category.  Yeah.  You know.  All right.  One of those don't understand.  But he does it to himself because he tweets all the time, like, I can't believe that my  wife likes me and loves me and still has sex with me, and I just can't believe  it.  And I read these tweets like, what?  Have you known for a week?  Because that's sort of what you think after a week or two.  They've been together a long time, 10 years or something.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I got to just, I got to shut the browser down. 
[02:13:30]  I got to shut the browser down or the show.  The show or the browser's got to go.  Supermodel Miranda Kerr reveals her victorious secrets, and one of them is to have a baby with  Orlando.  Now, that's what I'm reading now.  Yeah.  He's going to put a baby on the belly.  He's going to put himself in the world.  Victoriously revealed a figure become, but she appears to have other things in mind.  As a model revealed, she's keen to start a family. 
[02:14:00]  Steve would ask you fucking.  How did he do?  I can't even read it, because I'm not sure if we're allowed to go there anymore.  It's your call, is what I'm saying.  Oh.  I'll have to look.  Does Ann ever feel a little nostalgic for all?  And then there's a little nickname.  Oh, okay.  Then there's a nickname.  I understand.  Nostalgic.  No, it's not nostalgic.  Oh, Bob in Philly.  Bob.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, the other thing, you know, he doesn't want to leave her alone in case somebody fucks  her. 
[02:14:30]  If he tries to bring her to the movie, he's got Johnny Depp there.  Yeah, Johnny Depp.  Well, he hasn't been there.  Who else has she banged, though?  I just said his name.  Johnny Depp on the set of Pirates of the Caribbean, so he can't store her there, either.  Yeah, that's true.  I think that's the best story of the day.  The guy is giving up a movie career for her.  Yeah, that's good.  Right?  That is some good fucking pussy.  Unless it's some kind of movie that's close to home or wherever she's going to be.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  What's his name? 
[02:15:00]  Dorf?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Dorf?  Dork?  Oh, Stephen Dorf.  Or the other guy that sounds like that.  I don't know.  Someone will get it.  Torrey, Connecticut.  Hey, guys.  Doug Christie, too, is also the guy that every single time he scores a hoop, he does something.  He looks at his wife in the crowd and either points at her or makes a peace sign or something.  Those guys have got to get a clip of that.  It's fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Man up.  Man up.  Yeah, that's just a little too much.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Get over it.  Well, it could go the other way, though.  You hear about the crotchety wife?  Crotchety.  They're calling her the crotchety wife.  What's she doing?  Remember Lorena Bobbitt?  Yes.  There's a little twist on that.  A little more than crotchety.  Crotchety wife.  Here's the headline for everybody.  Oh, I get it.  Crotchety because she, it's crotch.  Crotchety wife scalds hubby for his cheating.  Imagine this.  Just imagine this one.  Enraged at being two-timed, a Queens woman poured boiling hot water on her unfaithful husband's groin as he slept. 
[02:16:00]  That sucks.  Can you imagine being woken up with that?  That's going to fuck you up.  Like, she probably didn't even realize how bad that will fuck you up.  Holy crap.  I thought it was going to be, I'll get him, he'll get burned.  Right, right.  No, it pretty much burns your dick off.  In a twisted act of revenge, name I can't even begin to.  All right, I'll give this one to Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  How do you say?  All right, wow.  O-Y-I-N-D-A.  O-Y-I-N-D-A.  Oy.  And that's the easy part of the name, by the way.  I see what you're doing.  O-Y-I-N-D-A.  How do you pronounce it?  O-Y-I-N-D-A.  I don't know. 
[02:17:00]  You want me to spell it again?  I'll spell it again.  How do you pronounce?  Why am I doing this?  Yeah.  Why am I encouraging him?  How do you pronounce Anthony?  O-Y-I-N-D-A.  O-Y-I-N-D-A.  I don't know.  I usually just say ****.  That old gag.  That's her first name.  Yeah.  Second name.  Ready for this one?  Uh-huh.  O-J-O-F-E-I-T-I-M-I. 
[02:17:30]  Hmm.  Um.  ****.  Is that how it's pronounced?  You don't have to mouth it, too.  ****.  You don't have to mouth it.  I always mouth it so I know how long to keep the beep going.  She's a registered nurse.  Carried out the crotch-scalding attack to ensure her spouse stopped cheating.  She was hurt and angry that after all this time married, he was sleeping or stepping out on her. 
[02:18:00]  She wanted to shut down that possibility forever because she he had treated her with such contempt.  The painful wake-up call left Emanuel, also a nurse, screaming in the bedroom of the couple's home.  I could hear it through the ceiling said a mother of two who rents upstairs apartment in the feuding couple's house.  It was a physical altercation.  It was the woman screaming and him in the background.  Yeah.  They took him out on a stretcher.  Wow.  Damn. 
[02:18:30]  Uh.  Third-degree burns all over his dick?  Well, the woman regretted, uh, her actions immediately and called 911.  911.  She was treating him with cold compresses when paramedics arrived.  He suffered second- and third-degree burns from his knees to his abdomen.  Third's bad.  Wow.  Uh, being treated at the burn unit.  Uh.  She probably had no idea, just thinking, oh, this'll get him.  It's boiling water.  Wow.  You're boiling his dick. 
[02:19:00]  There you go.  All right.  A lunatic.  Moving on.  So Henry Gates- oh, we got the Henry Gates 911 call.  911.  So, uh.  They called 911.  When's the beer happening?  Thursday?  You got Obama, you got Sergeant Crowley, and, uh, Professor Gates?  Yeah, they're all going to get together and have a little beer over at the White House  with Obama, the peacemaker.  You know what?  Know what Obama should do?  What?  Peace offering.  No.  Share the one beer. 
[02:19:30]  Just one beer?  Who would have more of a problem with sharing the one beer?  Oh, the cop.  You think the cop?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Now, okay, Obama takes a sip of a beer.  You love your beer, Ant.  Yeah, yeah.  And he hands you the beer.  What are you doing?  Um.  I guess I stopped drinking.  No, he- well, he's the president, so.  I guess- I don't know.  Tough call for you.  I don't want his fucking mouth on my goddamn- 
[02:20:00]  I don't care who it is.  Well, you don't like germs.  I would take George Bush's fucking beer.  You don't like germs in general.  Take Nixon.  I might take Reagan's.  You want to hear the 911 call?  I hear it's out today.  We got it in front of us.  I have not heard this yet.  Yeah, this is new to me.  You haven't heard it either?  No.  So the 911 call.  Harvard Professor Gates breaking into his house, obviously.  The big story.  Yeah.  That's almost over, finally.  They'll have their little beer, and then-  Yeah.  And then I guess we move on with more important things.  Okay.  Just having an older woman standing here, and she had noticed two gentlemen trying to get in a house at that number, 17 Ware Street. 
[02:20:30]  And they kind of had to barge in, and they broke the screen door, and they finally got in.  And when I had looked, I went further closer to the house a little bit after the gentlemen were already in the house.  I noticed two suitcases.  So I'm not sure if these are two individuals who actually work there, I mean, who live there.  Do you think they might have been breaking?  I don't know, because I have no idea.  I just noticed-  You think the possibility might have been there?  I don't know if they live there, and they just had a hard time with their key, but I did notice that they kind of used their shoulder to try to barge in, and they got in. 
[02:21:00]  Are they still in the house?  They're still in the house, I believe, yeah.  White, black, or Hispanic?  Well, there were two larger men.  One looks kind of Hispanic, but I'm not really sure.  And the other one entered, and I didn't see what he looked like at all.  I just saw her from a distance.  All right, so no mention of black.  No.  Which-  White, black, or Hispanic. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  So-  Yeah, no mention there.  I thought the call would be better than that.  Well, I hear there's radio transmissions, too.  Yeah, I want to hear that stuff.  Is that out yet?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  We would probably have it if it was out, right?  You would think we would.  All right.  Well, there's nothing really there.  No, I guess they're just going to smooth this over.  Yeah.  That's what Obama needs immediately.  Just get rid of this.  You know, get rid of the controversy.  Although, having him over for beer kind of keeps it going. 
[02:22:00]  Because when he does it, they're going to bring up the whole thing of why he's doing it again.  You might remember.  It's kind of weird that he's having a beer with these guys, because we can't imagine our president having beers in general.  Not a beer.  Especially in public.  We haven't really seen that.  I mean, like I said, this past campaign season, you saw a little of that with Hillary in the bars and stuff.  Yeah.  And I think Obama was in a bar or something as well.  Well, you know what it is?  For the past eight years, we've had George W. in there, who's supposedly, you know, recovered. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  So he had no booze at all.  All right.  What about Clinton, though?  Clinton tipped him.  In public, though?  Yeah.  He would do those things where they'd show him at a bar.  Right.  Like, and he'd take a sip of a beer on St. Paddy's Day or something.  That's what I'm getting at.  So you think they're actually drinking the whole beer, or it's just like a photo op?  Symbolic.  Yeah.  That's what I want to know about this Obama thing.  Is the press going to be there with him taking a swig?  Does Obama, like, go all in and go, no, I said I'm having a beer. 
[02:23:00]  We're having a beer.  Or is it a couple sips?  Get your photos and scram.  Go look at the monuments or something.  They're going to sit on the roof of the White House with Andy Dufresne and down some beers  and feel like real men.  That's a picture of Obama drinking a beer where?  I'm not sure where it's from.  It looks like some type of event.  Okay.  Well, and then, like, I don't think he could drink the beer is what I'm getting at.  I think it's got to be a symbolic thing, and it's going to be very interesting how it plays 
[02:23:30]  out because now the president drinks a beer and then goes back to work, which a million  people in this country do.  Yeah.  But I don't know if, like, the White House wants that image out there.  That he's drinking in there.  Like, he had a beer and went back to work.  And then, you know, the whole story would be, well, what was he working on after he drank  the beer?  Apparently.  Where he didn't have complete focus.  Health care bill.  You know they'll spin this into some completely negative thing is what I'm getting at.  Yeah, of course.  Unless it's a symbolic, well, here I can only have a few sips because maybe he makes a joke 
[02:24:00]  like, look, you know, a few sips, but I do have to get back to work.  Dale, here it is.  Or does he do it officially after work?  When does his work day end?  Officially stop?  I think you're president all the time.  I understand that.  But, I mean, does he do it at night so then more people are like, okay, he obviously is  kind of done for the day.  Like, what if he's hammered and then there's a global, like, problem where, you know, the  nuclear football is out there.  I don't think you could have...  Channel 5? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Who is she?  I don't know.  How distracting do we get?  Is she, like, a mulatto?  Christina DeBarge.  She's a singer.  Where does she come from?  I don't know.  Oh, and then the freaking chick with the fucking conditioner.  God damn.  Tease your hair.  Enough of the conditioner.  Get a topsy...  What is that?  A topsy turvy turd?  Dude, I used to see her in the gym.  She's fucking hot.  But the hair is the flattest hair I've ever seen in my life.  She's a good thing, girl.  Christina DeBarge. 
[02:25:00]  Goodbye.  Um, I don't remember now.  Don't matter.  I don't think he could drink the beer.  So I want to see how this plays out.  Here's what'll happen.  They will, uh...  Does he drink...  Each have separate beer.  Right.  They have to.  Okay.  And they'll pour it out into a glass, and they'll show all three of them there, kind  of, with smiles.  That'll be the picture.  With smiles and the beer in their hand.  And by the way, who isn't clamoring, if you're a beer company, to be the fucking beer that 
[02:25:30]  they use for this?  Dude, I...  What do you think?  What kind of beer do you think they're going to use for that presidential thing?  Dude, I...  Cool.  Sergeant Crowley said, and I tweeted this, he said,  make it a Blue Moon.  Blue Moon.  He said Blue Moon, and you gotta think, if you own Blue Moon, you're like, holy shit.  What's that?  Some little pissant brewery up in Mass?  Blue Moon rules.  I don't know where it's from.  F.H. Reilly's has it.  I think, if I might...  It really isn't. 
[02:26:00]  It might be local.  This is like the biggest beer promotion thing ever.  No kidding.  Wait.  No, I'm wrong.  Where's Blue Moon?  No, I'm wrong.  You don't like those type of beers, though.  Blue Moon's not bad.  I don't mind them.  Blue Moon's not a bad beer.  You throw a little orange or something in there?  A little orange.  A little orange.  A little fruit in your beer?  Oh, it's Canadian.  Blue Moon's Canadian?  Yeah.  I believe Sergeant Crowley said...  Why?  I believe Sergeant Crowley came out and said, look, as long as it's a Blue Moon.  So, I believe. 
[02:26:30]  Why, though?  How cool is that for that company?  So, he can't do it.  So, I gotta see how this plays out.  Yeah.  He can't...  Does Obama have a beer here and there?  Absolutely, but he's not showing the press or anybody.  He smokes, too, apparently.  Yeah.  He never stopped smoking, which I guess his kids give him a lot of crap about.  Oh, do they?  Oh, yeah.  You hear those stories.  Does he go, shut up, I'm the president?  Yeah.  Excuse me.  President of the United States. 
[02:27:00]  There he is with a cigarette in his mouth.  He looks really badass with a cigarette in his mouth, though.  I kinda like the pictures of him smoking.  He's just kinda...  Look at...  That's the president!  I kinda like that.  Give me a break.  That's kinda cool, man.  Come on.  That was like a mug shot.  Come on, dude.  Look.  But as far as cool goes...  Cool.  Come on.  We're not talking about his politics or anything else.  That's a cool fuckin' picture.  He's like...  With the cigarette out, just hanging out of his...  He's like, damn.  Out of his mouth.  It really doesn't fit him because he's a geek.  He's a nerd.  He's so a nerd.  He's a geek.  He's a nerd. 
[02:27:30]  His jeans when he threw out that first pitch.  I know it's kinda hack because everyone was talking about it.  But those jeans that he was wearing, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Look at him with the suit and the friggin'...  He was wearing a suit with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth?  Yeah.  He was working somewhere.  He was taking a little break.  Not shopped.  So, well, we'll see.  Damn.  Look at him.  Yeah.  He's right there.  Fuckin' A.  Carl from California.  Is this...  Come on, Carl. 
[02:28:00]  I love when we have, like, listeners that have done pretty interesting gigs.  Carl, you really used to...  You used to fly the president around, President Bush?  I did.  What?  Were you the pilot?  No, I was a flight engineer crew chief.  For real?  Yeah, serious.  You know the guy that drops the door down and loots the president?  Yeah.  Yeah, I did that.  That was you.  I did go up to Camp David and a couple other places.  And you're a listener to the show?  I've been listening to your show, man, for, like, two and a half years. 
[02:28:30]  Wow.  That's pretty fuckin' cool, man.  Not bad.  Okay.  Oh, Blue Moon is owned by Coors, I'm hearing.  Cool?  Cool.  But, uh, the president, uh, President Bush used to, uh, drink O'Doul's all the time.  Right.  They've seen him with, um, they've seen him with, like, a glass with beer in it.  But it's that non-alcoholic beer, which...  It's funny you say O'Doul's today.  I was at the supermarket on, uh, Broadway.  I like to try to keep it local for the people that live in, uh, Manhattan. 
[02:29:00]  And, uh, I was behind an old guy getting two six-packs of O'Doul's last night.  And I was thinking to myself, like, why?  Whiskey chaser?  You know?  You just belt it down.  But why?  Right, because, I mean, most people would agree beer isn't your first drink of choice  if you're not trying to get drunk.  Well.  If you're not trying to get drunk, though.  Well, even...  Do you sit there and go, wow, that, you know, beer in general tastes good?  Yes.  It tastes good sometimes.  I absolutely do. 
[02:29:30]  I, I am like, I love the taste of beer.  Besides the buzz, would that be your go-to beverage?  Wouldn't you go for, like, a soda or iced tea or something else before you go for a beer,  if you're looking for just a beverage?  All right, if I'm thirsty and, you know, I wake up in the morning, I'm not grabbing  a beer, I like, I just like ice-cold water.  So you would drink, you would drink O'Doul's?  No.  Take the alcohol out of the, no.  Out of the equation?  No, the alcohol is part of the taste.  It's part of what makes beer, beer.  So why was this old guy drinking O'Doul's? 
[02:30:00]  Probably a fucking old lush.  Alcohol destroyed his life.  He still wants to feel like he's drinking.  Is that what it is?  Because you still have that urge to drink?  So it takes care of that urge?  There were people, yeah, in the bar, you know, when the ex was working at the bar years and  years and years ago, and they would have O'Doul's at the bar, just so people could sit there  and talk with everyone at the bar and feel like, you know, they're drinking something.  Right. 
[02:30:30]  You have that, you know, the bottle's in your hand, the cigarette.  If you're in a situation where everyone else is drinking and you've got something in front  of you that looks like it could be a drink, I guess there's something where you do feel  a little more comfortable.  Yeah.  Because you don't have everyone, what's wrong, faggot?  You're not drinking?  Not drinking, Faggy.  Not drinking tonight?  Oh, Coke first.  What's the matter with you, Faggy?  And whenever you ask for anything non-alcoholic at a bar, they have to dress it up like it  is.  So if you get, like, club soda, it's in, like, a rocks glass with a swizzle stick and maybe 
[02:31:00]  a twist of lime in there.  Right.  So it kind of looks like you're drinking.  That's what I'm saying.  That's actually the go-to drink when I don't feel like drinking, but I don't want, you know,  people bothering me about the fact that I decide not to drink.  What are you drinking?  Vodka, motherfucker.  Vodka.  Are you?  So, Carl, he used to drink O'Doul's?  Yeah, he used to drink O'Doul's, but I tell you, those twins didn't drink O'Doul's.  I was out there for their 21st birthday party.  They had a big bonfire out there at the ranch. 
[02:31:30]  Which, yeah, of course, we wasn't privy to that, but we heard the entertainment going  on that night.  Not the hell.  I can imagine.  Where'd you stay?  What do you stay, with the plane or something?  Well, yeah, we're getting into some gray area there.  Ah.  I don't want to know where the crew stays and everything.  Listen to this.  No.  This guy's sharp.  I would just be, I'd be the dumb guy that goes, yes, we keep the plane here, and this  is how many people are around it at any given moment.  Well, I now believe that you were part of that whole flying around Bush thing. 
[02:32:00]  Swarm to secrecy.  Now, Carl, after that gig stopped, what was the next gig you got?  I love the drop-off.  Well, right now, I'm on the West Coast.  You guys know the Osprey, the V-22 Osprey?  Yes.  Yeah, we're working to stand that up, squatting up on the West Coast right now.  So, that's what I'm out here for.  Wow.  Those things have some problems.  Well, they had some problems past tense.  They're pretty, we've ironed out all the problems now. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, have you?  Yeah.  And what do you do as far as that goes?  Well, we help with the navigation.  We help load everything up.  We kind of sit in between the two pilots.  So, yeah.  Really cool aircraft.  Those things are fucked up.  Yeah, you just kind of, it must be weird to take off like that and then just kind of slowly,  start going forward.  Yeah.  That is pretty cool.  That's some big fucking propellers to twist around. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, it's about 38 feet in diameter, the propeller's on it.  For real?  Yeah, it's crazy.  Wow.  It's a crazy plane.  Takes off vertical.  Be long.  Vertical takeoff and landing.  Amazing.  Yeah, it's called VTOL.  Yes, VTOL.  Nice.  All right.  But, yeah, guys, really love the show.  Long-time listener, first-time caller.  Very cool.  Well, give us a ride sometime in one of those fucking...  I'm not riding in an Osprey, no way.  No, you're not.  I don't trust them.  Those things killed a lot of military men. 
[02:33:30]  They did.  They did.  Yeah, they did.  But they're all better now, though.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Carl.  Good luck.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Punch it out.  See?  Look at him.  You got to punch out.  Rob of Long Island has a very, very good observation.  Hey there, Rab.  Rob?  Yellow.  Oh, did we lose him?  Yellow?  Shit.  Doesn't sound like he's there.  What'd he say?  Well, he was going to say, Anthony won't drink with the president, but will eat convict asshole  for Miranda Kerr.  Look, I have my priorities. 
[02:34:00]  Holy shit.  That doesn't look good for you right now.  Why do people have to remember the previous breaks?  Can't we just continue?  That's pretty funny.  Can't we move forward?  All right.  How about we take another break to kind of catch up?  Someone is saying that we need to drink Fish Head or Southern Tier.  Chris C. in Virginia.  Pop it.  Danny, you ever have some Fish Head?  No, I've had something called...  It's called...  A Snapper Head.  Snapper Head.  A beer called Snapper Head? 
[02:34:30]  Yes.  This is called Dog Fish Head, I think.  Oh, I've had Dog Fish Head.  Yeah, here's a Snapper Head.  Was it good?  Yeah, Dog Fish Head's pretty good.  It's all like local micro-brews.  Yeah, the micro-brews are...  Oh, it's kale ale?  ...are just taking off now.  Yeah, this one, Snapper Head's an IPA.  It's really good.  They're really starting to take off now.  The micros?  They've been.  Micro-brew in a can?  Yeah, it's not bad.  It's not bad.  Usually they're in the bottles.  I went to this thing called Brewtopia a few years back.  No, you didn't.  I did.  Brewtopia. 
[02:35:00]  That's a play on the word utopia.  Yeah!  And it was just like a...  Like, you know how New York gets the big car show and all?  And it was basically the car show of beer.  And you just go, and you walk around with like a four-ounce glass, and you just drink beer all day.  It's awesome.  Wow.  And you could just go to places at different...  You know what?  You stand online and you...  Sounds kind of cool.  Yeah.  No wrong with that.  An hour.  Because, you know, you just drink the beer.  You think it's a tasting, but you're drinking everything that you're tasting.  Yeah.  So I was there with a friend for about two hours, and we were ripped. 
[02:35:30]  And we had to leave.  And that's probably you trying to keep it under control.  But it's everywhere.  You don't realize.  Until all of a sudden, you're walking from booth to booth, and you're like, man, I'm really drunk.  You don't realize.  Remember the tasting room at Sam Adams Brewery?  We went up there, and they have a big tasting room with a bunch of taps and stuff.  Yeah.  We sat there just drinking and getting hammered.  Our old pal is on TV again doing a whole commercial.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  I like seeing that.  They finally let him out of jail. 
[02:36:00]  They let him out of, yeah.  I fucking missed that guy.  Career jail that he was in.  Should we try calling him again?  Man, he would never.  He said he'll be a fan.  I have to keep selling my beer.  You guys almost destroyed my career.  I'm Jim Cook, and I can't be on the Opie and Anthony show.  He just picked the wrong day to be in studio.  He really did.  Although, I think they sponsored it, but they didn't know what they were sponsoring.  These are noble hops.  These are asshole disc jockeys. 
[02:36:30]  Thanks, Jim.  The destruction we have caused.  I mean, I don't want to say it's one of my favorite days, but how do I explain this?  Now, Jim Cook worked his whole life to build up Sam Adams' brewery.  He was the man.  You couldn't go anywhere in Boston without a Sam Adams.  First of all, an icon in Boston.  Right.  And all over the country, he became an icon.  He was the happy-go-lucky Sam Adams beer guy. 
[02:37:00]  Absolutely.  The face to the product.  And then you fast forward, he gets involved with us, and we did a lot of good business  for him, by the way.  Oh, my God.  They sold so much Sam.  And he couldn't get enough of us.  We did many broadcast rooms.  His brewery, his private tasting room.  Yeah.  We drank beer right out of the hoses.  Right out of the hose coming out of the big tanks.  Remember that?  We'd just drink it like you would drink water out of a backyard hose when you're thirsty.  Oh, yeah.  That's how we were drinking beer.  It was amazing. 
[02:37:30]  It's great.  And then you fast forward, he gets involved with us, he goes horribly wrong, and on the  front page of the Boston Herald is hardcore bar owners pouring Sam Adams into the fucking-  Dumping Sam Adams into the gutter.  Into the sink and the gutter.  Into the sewers.  And saying they'll never again stock it or have it or serve it because of what-  Jim Cook and Sam Adams was involved with, with us and the church, it got so ugly.  And I felt so bad for Jim because he just, he's the guy, the face to the product. 
[02:38:00]  His whole life is dedicated to this beer.  And we pretty much flushed it down the toilet in one day.  But he's a stand-up guy because I remember, I've told this story on the air, I'm sorry  if you've heard this, but Jim Cook called me, and he was kind of whispering, like he's  being held hostage.  He's like, look-  I can't talk very loud. 
[02:38:30]  They're beating me.  This is horrible.  I've been exiled from beer.  I'm not allowed to be in beer.  It's all I know.  It's all I know.  I got a temp job.  In an office.  I can't even drink my own beer in public.  You guys have ruined me.  I'm Jim Cook.  I don't know why this is funny. 
[02:39:00]  But he whispers to me, he goes,  I'm Jim Cook.  I'm supposed to be one.  Why is that nine millimeter?  I was Jim Cook.  Bam.  He goes, Opie.  And he was whispering, like he was in a boardroom, like in between being yelled at or something.  Opie, I just want to let you and Anthony know.  I would call him, but he doesn't answer his phone.  I can't tell you how many times I've heard that, by the way.  Yeah.  I'd call Anthony, but he doesn't answer his phone.  So make sure he gets this message.  Yeah.  I love you guys. 
[02:39:30]  You were great for me.  I will always love you guys.  Yeah.  And maybe, maybe someday, way down the road, we could work together again.  But you're going to see and hear things.  Yeah.  Just know I have to do this to say yes.  I have to do this.  Hi, this is Jim Cook for Sam Adams.  I hate Opie and Anthony.  I think that was the next commercial.  That was like the next commercial.  But the behind the scenes phone call is like, and I respected that more than anything.  He's like, I love you guys. 
[02:40:00]  We've done some great shit.  Maybe we'll work together again, but.  Nothing's better hating Opie and Anthony, too, than a summer ale.  The best part, though, is the, and I want to say it again, but you're going to hear and see things.  You're going to hear things, yeah.  Like, I have to do this.  Yeah.  And I'm like, and I felt, you know, to be Greg Hughes for a second, I felt so bad.  I'm like, Jim, whatever you have to do, I understand. 
[02:40:30]  We feel horrible.  Yeah.  It wasn't supposed to go down that way.  And that was it.  I never heard from him again.  That was, how many years ago?  Seasonal beer.  Seven years ago?  Shuck, jock, shitheads.  All right.  Why don't we.  Yeah, that was a while ago.  I think it might be due for a call.  I'm thinking.  You know what?  That new goddamn glass is out.  You see that new Sam Adams glass?  It's crazy.  Dude, that shit is off the hook, yo.  It is.  It's whack.  It's got. 
[02:41:00]  You know what the coolest thing is?  They've laser etched a circle on the bottom, inside bottom of the glass.  Oh, wow.  Now, you know when you pour a beer and there's an imperfection in the glass, a bubble will just come out of it?  They've etched, a laser etched a circle in the bottom of the glass.  So when you pour the beer, there's a circle of bubbles that come up to give that aromatic.  It releases the aroma.  You know what?  It doesn't make that much of a difference.  Then it's thinner walled and rounded shape, maintains proper beer temperature longer. 
[02:41:30]  But besides being a hardcore beer drinker, does it really make a difference?  Well, you know, if you're just drinking any swill, perhaps.  But, you know, he's very proud of his Sam Adams Boston Lager.  I don't know what you're serving down at F.H. Riley's.  Exactly.  Do we serve it there?  I don't think so.  Not until you get a fucking phone call from Jim Cook personally.  I don't serve it at my bar.  We drink out of flimsy, bottom, top-heavy, and bottom-too-small Pilsner glasses. 
[02:42:00]  Although Danny did happen to crack open a nice big pint glass.  Half-inch thick.  Half-inch thick pint glass in the hot tub.  You want to call...  You're not the only one, Travis.  Yeah, I made a boo-boo.  You want to call Jim?  You want to call Cook?  Oh, my God.  That's scary.  Is it?  Oh, my God.  Do you have his numbers still?  I don't know if it works.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  He'd hate to be blindsided like that.  I feel bad.  He's just starting.  Hi, is Jim Cook in? 
[02:42:30]  Hold on.  I'll connect you to his assistant.  Oh, no.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, better watch that.  What happened?  Yeah, we'll just watch that.  We need to...  Opie, come on.  We need to alert people that they will be broadcast.  Yeah.  Do we?  That was speakerphone that was on a little too loud.  Opie managed to do a private phone call.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  It was a little loud.  Why don't we take a break?  It's a little loud.  I believe that's one of them peckers.  Oh! 
[02:43:00]  All right.  Yeah, that was our Jim Cook.  Oh, Jim the trucker.  You know what?  We got to get this update because I don't know if the trucker could hang on the line.  Yes.  Jim the trucker.  Jim, what are you hauling, first of all?  Oh, truck parts.  What?  Truck parts?  Truck.  Truck parts.  Yeah, I work for a truck manufacturer.  So you could, like, blow an axle and just kind of grab one from the back?  Yeah, right. 
[02:43:30]  Geez, I could use one, too.  It's not that far.  Anyway, I live in Silverton.  Oh, congratulations.  With the mayor with the tits.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  So, anyway, here's what the deal is.  The way that happened was this guy is a homegrown boy born and raised there in Silverton.  He owns the local movie theater.  And he was actually the mayor once before, 20 years ago, before he had tits.  Oh, when he was a guy?  Yeah.  Well, he's still a guy.  It's kind of funny.  He's really not effeminate at all from the way he looks. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  But he owns the movie theater there.  And he likes to dress up as the stars, the female star.  So he kind of snuck it in on us.  All of a sudden, about 10 years ago, we started noticing he had painted fingernails.  And then pretty soon, he's wearing dresses, not a theater.  And it's kind of like, what the hell is going on with Stu?  Tension whore.  So it kind of came on real slow like that.  And he's actually, the guy is pretty well-known locally before the boobs.  He's actually a genius.  And everybody in town likes him. 
[02:44:30]  So when it came time to elect a new mayor, the other guy had been in there 18 years.  And the town had been growing.  And there was some little bit of unrest about how the town was shaping up.  And they liked his policy.  So he got elected.  I think the problem I have is that he flaunts it.  He just flaunts the whole thing.  Yeah, that's the thing.  He's like over the top with the whole thing.  He makes a horrid woman.  Yeah, and doesn't look like a woman whatsoever.  Well, that's the problem.  That's one thing.  He was an ugly man who's an even uglier woman.  Yeah, he's really bad. 
[02:45:00]  Nice.  But yeah, he has a, it'd be one thing to dress like a woman.  But he likes to dress like a streetwalker.  I mean, he wears, he wears fuck me pumps and short skirts and tight sweaters and t-shirts and stuff.  Awful straw hair.  Yeah, he's got a bald spot on top of his head too, which makes it really attractive.  Jesus.  That's what you want in your women?  He's got a skull cap or whatever it's called.  He's got a skullet.  Skullet, thank you.  Skullet.  But the small town is about 8,000 or 9,000 people.  So it just kind of, it just kind of happened. 
[02:45:30]  Like everybody knows him and knew that, well, he's okay.  He's not really weird.  He's not gay.  He's got, he's been with the same woman for 30 years.  However, she dresses like a man.  But isn't he now gay because he's a woman with a woman or, I don't know, I don't understand how that all works out.  Well, because his girlfriend looks like a guy.  Oh, all right.  There you go.  So when you said yesterday there's a scrapbook involved in there somewhere, I suspect there may be.  He looks like, what's his name from Aerosmith? 
[02:46:00]  Oh, God damn.  From Aerosmith?  The drummer?  No.  I'd be glad to hear that.  I'm fucking, the blonde dude.  I forgot his name.  Oh, oh.  Guitar player.  Yeah, guitar player.  Help me out.  Aerosmith fans.  Eh, I don't know.  Not Perry.  That's Steve Perry.  No, Hamilton.  Yeah.  Anyway, he's, you were wondering how old he is.  No, not Hamilton.  He's 61 years old.  Tom Hamilton?  He's older than me.  He's what?  He's 61 years old.  Oh, wow.  Awesome, thanks.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:46:30]  Jim the Trucker.  Appreciate it.  We're not all nuts.  We just got one for a mayor.  Yeah, that's a little strange.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  Who's the, uh, uh, Brad, uh, uh, who you got?  Brad Whitford.  Tom Hamilton?  No, not Hamilton.  The other dude.  Brad Whitford?  Is it Brad Whitford?  Yeah, do Brad Whitford.  I'm just getting everything here.  Yeah, here you go.  Yeah, there it is.  Here's your mayor.  He looks like Brad Whitford.  He really does.  It's a bad picture of Brad, but, ah, you get the point. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, you want an update?  Jim Norton on the, uh, movie set.  Yes.  I think we got a little update.  Jimmy's doing a little film, I think, somewhere in the Boston area or north of Boston.  He's up there for a couple weeks.  Yeah.  I think he's going to come back to try to do a little radio, then he goes back next week  for a few days.  So he's going to be back and forth.  He'll be back on our show Friday.  Uh, but he, he, uh, he texted us that he was five feet away from Brooke Shields yesterday.  Yeah, in makeup.  In makeup, and he was losing his mind. 
[02:47:30]  So let's, uh, I think we got an update from Jim Norton here.  Hey, it's Jim.  I'm, uh, on the set here in Boston of Surrey Vengeance.  We had a 5.50 pickup, which means I got up at 5.15, and it's now about 8, shit, I don't  know, 8.45, which is the way, that's the way it is on a movie set, and, uh, I was sitting  in the makeup trailer, and Brooke Shields was, like, two feet from me.  I'm such a fag, I couldn't even say hi.  Yeah, I was like, all right, she's probably busy.  She's getting makeup done. 
[02:48:00]  I'm like, she's too busy to say, all right, I'm such a fucking starstruck worm.  I'm doing a movie with somebody, and I can't even speak to them.  I'm a fool.  So it's going good.  It's really hot.  There's mosquitoes all over the place.  And, uh, I kind of feel like I have to shit.  It's like there's nothing worse than a hot day, but we have to shit.  That's it, there's your update.  Jimmy, he's fucking, he's such a weirdo.  I know, it's like, you're doing a movie.  Enjoy it. 
[02:48:30]  Enjoy the experience.  Yeah, have a little fun.  All right, uh, Jackson, Michael Vick, we could do a little of that.  I don't know what else we want to do today.  My God, I can't stop looking at this fucking thing.  Miranda, Jesus.  I just found a whole nother, a whole, it's like mining.  When you're mining on the internet, and then you hit another vein.  It's like, hey, I hit, I hit struck gold.  I hit this, it's, it's, um, 4,256 pictures of her. 
[02:49:00]  How many pictures have you seen so far?  Um, on 80.  Jesus.  So I got a few thousand.  It's all about her today, man.  A few thousand.  She'll be number one.  Naked ones.  She'll be number one on Google Trends easily.  This one will easily be number one.  Miranda Kerr.  Even though we're, we're hoping that you Google what, uh, ah, shit.  Duty, stain.  Duty, stain, beauty mark.  Stain, not, right?  Just duty, stain.  Duty, stain, beauty mark.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Okay.  And if you're, if you're good, when we come back, we're going to give you the 10 things  you did not know about the naked cowboy.  Oh, fantastic.  Fantastic.  This guy gets more fucking press than anybody.  Why?  We don't know.  We'll find out next.  Hope you and Anthony.  I think we're supposed to get the autopsy results in the Michael Jackson case this week.  Oh, wow.  Keep that story going.  Long overdue, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I think finally this week, they're basically saying he was murdered. 
[02:50:00]  Really?  It's a homicide.  Yeah.  Maybe unintentional.  I mean, most likely unintentional.  What am I saying?  Slaughter.  But they're pretty much saying the doctor injected him with that drug, that anesthesia, whatever,  what is it called again?  The Proto, Propofol or whatever.  Yeah.  That, that doctor, that Dr. Murray, he, he's actually admitting that he gave Jackson that  drug.  Oops.  That they're saying now was the cause of his death.  And they're also saying he was dead a really long time.  A couple hours. 
[02:50:30]  A couple hours.  And, and Dr. Murray's whole thing was, holy shit, I'll make, you know, I got to,  make believe the guy's still alive.  So then the paramedics show up and they all said, they're now coming out saying, look,  the guy was dead when we got there, but he insisted that, you know, we try to resuscitate  him.  Oh, quick, resuscitate him.  So the, so now the paramedics, they're, they're putting their lips on dead guy lips and they're  trying to keep them alive or whatever, or bring them back to life.  The bag. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Something.  And then, um, and then, uh, yeah, brought them to the hospital, which isn't, which isn't  the way you do it.  If, if you go to someone's house and there's, they are dead, dead.  Now you're calling the corner.  Yeah.  You're not bringing them to the hospital.  But that's exactly.  Yeah.  We don't have Jim C today, but, uh, but Dr. Murray was trying to save his own ass.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  Now he's, uh, now he's in Dutch.  Dude, he's fucked.  He was telling his patients that he got a, uh, a job of a lifetime.  And now he wasn't, wasn't as long as he expected. 
[02:51:30]  Oh no, he's just fucked.  Absolutely fucked.  So, uh, any day now on that, I mean, I think there's going to be some doozies in there.  Criminal charges.  Yeah.  We're hearing, you know, we're hearing things, but I think even on top of that, there's going  to be some doozies.  Yeah.  I think there's going to be an amazing amount of drugs in it that they found in this system.  Oh yeah, and it isn't just going to be that one.  Just a ridiculous amount.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Uh, this day in history, usually we blow this shit off, but there's a bunch of, a bunch of, 
[02:52:00]  uh, interesting ones in here.  Mel Gibson's drunk antisemitic rant.  How many years ago, Ian?  Hmm.  I'll really try to hit it.  I'm going to say six.  All right.  Three years ago.  Three?  The final, this one.  Yeah.  The final, the final Regis and Kathie Lee show.  Now Regis was old when Kathie Lee was leaving his program.  Yeah.  Cause there was speculation that he wouldn't even continue doing the show.  And now it's Regis and Kelly. 
[02:52:30]  You always have to think.  Kelly.  Cause you still want to say Kathy.  How long was he with, um, Kathie Lee?  I don't know.  Honestly, I don't know.  I mean, like I would guess like 15 years, something like that.  Well, the final Regis and Kathie Lee show was nine years ago already.  Nine.  And Regis was old nine years ago.  Yeah.  And, and this is the one that made us go, wow.  Judy Garland.  Yeah.  Remember that, you know, that song over the rainbow.  So.  Of course.  How many years ago?  Well, you know the answer to this cause it gave it.  Like 70 years ago, she recorded that 70, 70. 
[02:53:00]  Holy shit.  Ah, there it is.  Every gay man's anthem.  Here it is.  Somewhere over the rainbow.  Can you totally do this one?  Oh, let me try.  You haven't totally do.  You haven't totally do that.  I haven't...  I haven't...  SIREN SINGS

[02:56:00]  I don't know why  it's just catchy  um  like gates  what is footer saying today 
[02:56:30]  hey let me uh  change gears here  footer  what are you saying  first of all  it's very hard to follow  the uh  toodly do  yes of course it is  I love the toodly do  a lot of pressure  on you sir  I do too  I do too  now what it was  is uh  yesterday  I had these two guys  come to my house  in the uh  like late afternoon time  and they have like  let's say like 
[02:57:00]  alarm company  like hats on  they both have badges  not like really uniforms  but just like  like collared shirts  with like embroidery  shit on it  and they  so I open my door  and they  one dude comes at me  like a sales type of guy  and he's explaining to me  um  something about alarms  and they want to put  this little  fucking you know  they put like  the little thing  in your front lawn  or whatever  yeah  he's saying something  about where  he wants to place that  and da da da  so  he's  I have the door  halfway open  he sees my unit  and he's like  oh you know  you got an old unit there  so right away  I'm saying  oh this is going to 
[02:57:30]  fucking be like  a sales thing  so  in this  ten minute conversation  that I'm half listening  to him the whole time  he's asking me  these certain questions  like one question  was uh  oh um  this is you  and your wife here  um  I answer the question  then he goes up  to something stupid  then he asks me  something about  oh so you have  one dog  my dog's like  sticking his head out  and I'm like  yeah he's like  oh um  how much does a dog weigh  and I'm like  well um  I answer his question  then I wait a little while  next thing you know  like the guy had asked me  three or four different questions  and it finally  kicked into me  I'm like 
[02:58:00]  like I'm an asshole  I'm like what the fuck  I close the fucking door  I look at both  and I'm like  what the fuck  are you two trying to do  like I think that  they were almost  trying to like  case my fucking house  but they were doing it  in a way that  I didn't even realize  but I gave the guy  like within a ten minute  conversation  I ended up giving him  like a lot of information  you know  and he panicked me  so that's why  so that's why  I closed the door  and just fucking  like lost my mind  like what the fuck  so they're losing  I'm losing my mind  and the guy  like turns to me  he's like  sir  I don't know 
[02:58:30]  what we did  but I'm so sorry  he's like  I only asked you  about the dog  because we have  certain motion sensors  that over an 80  they had a fucking answer  for every one of the questions  but the way  they were approaching me  you know what  I don't blame you  for it  because I mean  I've heard stories  where these guys  are legit doing their jobs  but then they  they pass the info  onto their pals  yeah  that's what  exactly why I called  to ask your opinion  on that  like  was I wrong  and my fucking chick  was like  typical you  you're flipping out  because I mean  I was dude  I mean like 
[02:59:00]  I called them both out  I told them  I'm going to go  back to my bedroom  go onto my fucking bed  they're both done  like I was losing my mind  and I would have been paranoid  and it's just unsolicited  they came to your door  to ask if you needed  an alarm system  no no no  they didn't even ask that  what they were having  they even had like  the laminate brochures  what they were trying  to basically say to me  I think  and I still don't  really understand it  was that all they  wanted to do  was like  through the home  of the association  they would go around  to the house  and look to see  where they  they have illuminated 
[02:59:30]  like whatever  I'm making it up  ADP or something  and it's going to be  illuminated on your  front lawn  and they were looking  to see where's a good  spot to put them  in your front lawn  within your shrubs  or whatever  so all they were there  for was to put a sign  on your lawn  right  like to see  if it would be okay  and then when I had  my door halfway open  he saw my unit  like the little  when you open the door  you know whatever  like your keypad  yeah  and he's like  oh you know  that's outdated  right there too  and he said  do you have home phones 
[03:00:00]  because if you do  we have the new one  that you can use  your cell phone  he got too much  into shit  where I was confused  and then it hit me  like a ton of pressure  like I just fucking  answered legitimately  like how many dogs  I have  I mean just  all these weird questions  and when you ask me  how much my dog weighed  I'm like  that's it  you know I'm like  good  I would be paranoid  but it seems like  it's questions  they need to know  the answer to  so it puts you  in that weird spot 
[03:00:30]  like how much  is too much info  exactly  but I'm the type of guy  where it came to that point  like I said  I panicked  where I'm like  now I have to set precedence  with these motherfuckers  and let them know  like who the fuck  do you think  you're dealing with  like you know what I mean  like I had to  I felt like I had to  let them know  like if you are  trying something  don't fucking even  think about it  because you're both dead  like my dog's gonna bite you  I'm gonna shoot you  you know  alright let me  let me go to the phones here  because we got two  two very interesting  phone calls coming in  we got Ken in Philly first  Ken you're on with Footer 
[03:01:00]  hey guys how you doing  alright  well first of all  Footer's a fucking idiot  because everybody  that's ever had  an alarm system  with a dog  will know  that that's exactly  why they asked that question  I used to install  alarm systems for a living  and everything  they might be  they might not be great  coming out of your house  and acting like that  and like trying to sell  but they're trying to sell  you a system  yeah  all those questions  they ask are exactly  100% point on  trying to get you  selling an alarm system  maybe they tried to sell  it the wrong way  but that's exactly  what they do  hey you cocksucker 
[03:01:30]  listen to me  if someone comes to  your fucking house  okay  and starts rattling  off questions  I don't give a fuck  who you are  you did a bad job  at what you fucking do  so I'm not  absolutely  a bad salesman  but you're the idiot  for fucking letting him  in your house  what  you're the idiot  for letting him  in your house  I didn't let him  in my house  asshole  you opened the door  and you had your door open  they could see you have a dog  what's stopping this  sit back with joy  fucking reaping you  home invasion  Anthony  right  home invasion 
[03:02:00]  like I said  you start the conversation  foot as an idiot  fuck you  because exactly  why I called  is to let people  you know what  how the fuck  do I know  because you have  a little fucking badge  and cause you  right  those guys  shouldn't have  come to your house  that way  exactly  so don't call me  the fucking idiot  well you're still  an idiot  but that's okay  okay fair enough  no no maybe  we gotta start it up  on the wrong foot  alright  maybe  alright thank you Kat  more importantly  I think I found  high school pictures 
[03:02:30]  of  oh now we're down  to high school pictures  yeah Miranda  Kerr  yeah  I think I found  some  look at her  pretty skinny  but black hair  it's all about  Miranda Kerr  hell yeah  google that shit  immediately  I tweeted that shit  hours ago  let me go to  now footer  yo  now we got  this guy calling  another guy from  Pennsylvania  here's Jim  Jim go ahead  what's up boys  hey  hey listen 
[03:03:00]  there's some serious  shit going on  I live in a nice  neighborhood out  in Pennsylvania  and you know  trust me  it's no wine dance  it's pretty nice  and we have people  casing properties  every single day  last week  it was in the  Redding Eagle  you can look it up  this guy walks up  to this lady's house  knocks on her door  it's an older lady  and says ma'am  your neighbors behind  you are putting  in a fence  we need to go  measure off  your property  so as he  and the old lady  walk around 
[03:03:30]  to the back  of the house  the guy  his partner  who's up the street  parked in the car  jumps out of his car  goes into the house  and rips the lady  off for $100,000  that's only  $100,000  laying around her house  but it's documented  it was in the  Redding Eagle  it's unbelievable  the shit that's  going on  last night  I had a guy  come to my house  offering to clean  my stairs  I did the same  thing that  footer did  I freaked the fuck  out  I ran out  the house  and told the guy  get the hell  off my property  you don't need  to be coming around 
[03:04:00]  knocking on my door  and I started  preaching off  that no soliciting  bullshit stuff  shake your fist  at him  why you  I don't think  I'm as paranoid  as Anthony  but I think  I'm with footer  on this one  just because  somebody with  a little badge  is at your  door  that's not enough  to just start  giving away  all sorts of  information  exactly  and the way  like I said  the way they  did it  was that  I didn't even  really kind of  it didn't hit me  that I gave out  so much information  and that's what  panicked me  is that I realized  holy fucking shit  like I gave out  you're ready to  give out your 
[03:04:30]  keypad code  and everything  well I didn't know  what I did say  to the guy  I go  understand where  the fuck  I'm coming from  I go  what do you want  my fucking  bank account  number two  like that's  what kind of  I was going at  I'm like  are you guys  kidding me  I don't want  to seem like  the asshole  here  but I even  tried to put  it on there  I'm like  you understand  why I'm  acting the way  I'm acting  right now  you know  what I mean  I gave him  one of them  anyway boys  I'm punching  no you're not  punching out  footer  hold on a minute  there's a couple  things going on  here  footer  phone call  of the morning  wow  and thought 
[03:05:00]  starter of the  day  look at the  phones  everybody wants  to talk about  this  you're not  going anywhere  footer  we got  Brian in  Maryland  Brian  you're on  with footer  good evening  good evening  I had the  same shit  happen to  my wife  these guys  came by  and they  wanted to  put a sign  up  it was the  same shit  the footer  is saying  and I  started asking  like hey  oh you know  I hear you  have a dog  he said he  was coming  to upscale  houses  to put a 
[03:05:30]  sign out  he didn't  want to  sell the  alarm  he just  wanted us  to put a  sign  and compensate  us  he kept  saying  compensate  you  my wife  was asking  like what  do you  do  I mean  you're  not  selling  anything  and you  know  he just  he was  really vague  and he  wasn't as  put together  as what  footer's  talking about  but you  know  it just  seems  suspicious  and we  had seen  him doing  this in  the  neighborhoods  so we  called the  police  gave a  description  told everybody  in the  neighborhood  what this  guy's up  though  right  yeah  it does  seem weird  that they  just want 
[03:06:00]  to put a  sign on  your  lawn  and then  they  you know  look inside  your house  yeah  fuck that  there's gotta  be  there's a  total scam  all right  hold on  because now  Brandon wants  to call  footer an idiot  again  Brandon  in California  hey boys  what's going  on  hey man  basically  footer is  the idiot  in the  situation  he  shut the  door on  them right  away  not  answered  any of  their  questions  if you  buy  an alarm  these are  all legit  questions  they're 
[03:06:30]  going to  ask you  because if  your animal  is over  40 pounds  you have  to use  a different  motion  sensor  and these  guys get  paid  commission  by going  door to  door and  the guy  that was  with them  is his  installer  so if  you agree  to it  they would  install it  right then  and there  fuck that  door-to-door  salesman  once again  we're not  shutting the  door  don't you  understand  though  how  if someone  comes to  your fucking  door to  solicit something  to you  and starts  rattling off  questions  he's a fucking  terrible  businessman  either way 
[03:07:00]  I'm right  for flipping  the fuck  out  I don't  care if  this is  a proper  code  here  what we  do  I don't  know  what the  fuck  alarm  people do  how the  fuck  do I  know  so when  a girl  scholar  comes to  your door  are you  going to  flip out  because she  wants to  tell you  what I  do  when the  girl  tries to  sell me  cookies  I have  her  stuff  like  cocks  first  then  if she  does  a good  job  I buy  the  cookies  no  stupid  it's  two  different  things  he's doing  his job  he presents  himself to  you  and then  you buy  the alarm  and if  you're not  interested  you shut  the door 
[03:07:30]  like you do  with everyone  else  I can't let  that pass  though  footer  even though  you had  a very  good  comeback  he did  get you  with the  he did  nail  you  he kind  of nailed  you  with the  cookie  thing  that was  funny  it was  a good  image  Brandon  good job  let me go  to Kurt  in Canada  this will sum  up the  whole thing  right here  Kurt  give us  some  knowledge  I'm  actually  living  in Wichita  I live  a few  blocks  away  from where  BTK  committed  his first  murder  he worked  for ADT  at the time  there you go 
[03:08:00]  I'm the  asshole  right  I'm the  asshole  I think  footer  wins  is that  really true  BTK  killer  worked  for ADT  I'm not  100%  OMG  he worked  for a home  security  company  no LOL  no  alright  there you  go  I don't  think  footer  is  paranoid  I really  don't  I appreciate  the time  I'll talk  to you guys  later  and  E-Rock  is very  fat  and obese  and it's  disgusting 
[03:08:30]  but he  is the  hero  he keeps  this whole  place running  the show  doesn't run  without him  alright footer  you do get  phone call  of the day  which means  you get to  go into  the  Ron and Fez  prize closet  call them up  and get  something free  from them  and I'm  gonna give  Booby Man  instant feedbacker  of the day  oh what did  he instantly  feedback  he said  OP's great  oh  well  why wouldn't  you then  throw it at  him  let him
